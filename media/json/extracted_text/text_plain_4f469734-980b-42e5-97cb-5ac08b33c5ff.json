Mulberry St<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1933<br />\n<br />\nHonor System Effective<br />\nIT IS evident that the revisions made<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins honor system have<br />\nproved effective, despite what many may<br />\nsay and despite the fact that it has been<br />\nannounced that two have been expelled,<br />\nthree made to repeat courses, and that<br />\nfour have withdrawn from the University<br />\nrather than stand Student Council trial<br />\nfor honor system violations.<br />\nIt is, without a doubt, due to the regulation which does not permit a student to<br />\nleave the room during the taking of examinations that Student Council has had<br />\nbrought before it more cases this month<br />\nthan ever before in the same length of<br />\ntime. Previously, students had the opportunity to cheat freely because they<br />\nwere free to go where they so desired to<br />\ntake the examinations. No one, either<br />\nprofessor or student, was aware, in most<br />\ncases, whether cheating was actually being done. But now the cheater is more<br />\neasily observable by those honest students<br />\nin the room.<br />\nThe fact that of the cases reported to<br />\nthe Council all but one were brought<br />\nbefore the governing body by students is<br />\nindicative of a progressive step. It is a<br />\ndefinite indication that there is arising an<br />\nattitude toward the work of the Council<br />\nand the honor system which is both desirable and so sorely needed on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe honor system was established by<br />\nthe student body and it is up to the student body to cooperate and make it effective. There is no place here, or in<br />\nany university for that matter, for cheaters. If a man must rely upon \"cribbing\"<br />\nto pass examinations, upon which too<br />\nmuch importance is placed, he should not<br />\nbe in the University. If a man is seen<br />\ncheating it is the duty of the observer<br />\nof the violation of the honor code to<br />\nfirst warn the offender and, if the warning goes unheeded, to report the case to<br />\nthe Council.<br />\n<br />\nPay Class Dues!<br />\nOFFICERS of the Junior Class and<br />\nSeniors Class are anxious to collect dues<br />\nat once. It is imperative that members<br />\nof these two classes especially cooperate<br />\nbecause the plans for the two big functions of the college year\u2014the Junior<br />\nProm and June Week\u2014is dependent<br />\nlargely upon the financial support which<br />\njuniors and seniors give.<br />\nJack Henderson, chairman of June<br />\nWeek, is capable of arranging an interesting and appealing program. But he<br />\ncannot make definite arrangements until<br />\nhe can ascertain what funds will be available from Senior Class dues, which have<br />\nbeen reduced this year.<br />\nJ. M. Scott, chairman of the Junior<br />\nProm committee, and his associates are<br />\nanxious to make the 1933 Prom one of<br />\nthe best ever sponsored by the third-year<br />\nclass.

ROEBUCK &amp; SON<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\n119 W. Mulberry St<br /><br />\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1933<br /><br />\nHonor System Effective<br />\nIT IS evident that the revisions made<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins honor system have<br />\nproved effective, despite what many may<br />\nsay and despite the fact that it has been<br />\nannounced that two have been expelled,<br />\nthree made to repeat courses, and that<br />\nfour have withdrawn from the University<br />\nrather than stand Student Council trial<br />\nfor honor system violations.<br />\nIt is, without a doubt, due to the regulation which does not permit a student to<br />\nleave the room during the taking of examinations that Student Council has had<br />\nbrought before it more cases this month<br />\nthan ever before in the same length of<br />\ntime. Previously, students had the opportunity to cheat freely because they<br />\nwere free to go where they so desired to<br />\ntake the examinations. No one, either<br />\nprofessor or student, was aware, in most<br />\ncases, whether cheating was actually being done. But now the cheater is more<br />\neasily observable by those honest students<br />\nin the room.<br />\nThe fact that of the cases reported to<br />\nthe Council all but one were brought<br />\nbefore the governing body by students is<br />\nindicative of a progressive step. It is a<br />\ndefinite indication that there is arising an<br />\nattitude toward the work of the Council<br />\nand the honor system which is both desirable and so sorely needed on the<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe honor system was established by<br />\nthe student body and it is up to the student body to cooperate and make it effective. There is no place here, or in<br />\nany university for that matter, for cheaters. If a man must rely upon \"cribbing\"<br />\nto pass examinations, upon which too<br />\nmuch importance is placed, he should not<br />\nbe in the University. If a man is seen<br />\ncheating it is the duty of the observer<br />\nof the violation of the honor code to<br />\nfirst warn the offender and, if the warning goes unheeded, to report the case to<br />\nthe Council.<br /><br />\nPay Class Dues!<br />\nOFFICERS of the Junior Class and<br />\nSeniors Class are anxious to collect dues<br />\nat once. It is imperative that members<br />\nof these two classes especially cooperate<br />\nbecause the plans for the two big functions of the college year\u2014the Junior<br />\nProm and June Week\u2014is dependent<br />\nlargely upon the financial support which<br />\njuniors and seniors give.<br />\nJack Henderson, chairman of June<br />\nWeek, is capable of arranging an interesting and appealing program. But he<br />\ncannot make definite arrangements until<br />\nhe can ascertain what funds will be available from Senior Class dues, which have<br />\nbeen reduced this year.<br />\nJ. M. Scott, chairman of the Junior<br />\nProm committee, and his associates are<br />\nanxious to make the 1933 Prom one of<br />\nthe best ever sponsored by the third-year<br />\nclass. But the committee must be assured of the financial support, by payment<br />\nof dues and purchase of Prom tickets at<br />\na reduced price, of every member of the<br />\nJunior Class in order that it may carry<br />\nout its plans with success. In reference<br />\nto the Prom, the committee has already<br />\nset the date of the affair definitely for<br />\nApril 22 and the place, the Alcazar Ballroom. The band will be decided upon<br />\nbefore the close of this month.<br />\nJuniors and Seniors should display<br />\nenough interest in their respective classes<br />\nto pay class dues.<br /><br />\nSays Structure Tottering<br /><br />\nDeclaring that the social structure<br />\nis tottering under the tremendous<br />\nweight which has been placed upon<br />\nit, the banker said in part:<br />\nGovernment flows from the people.<br />\nFor the same reason that water does<br />\nnot rise higher than its source, no goverment is stronger than the people<br />\ngoverned. In our flight from confidence in ourselves to reliance upon<br />\ngovernment, our position becomes almost absurd. There is hardly a class<br />\namong us which seems willing to stand<br />\non its own feet.<br />\nEveryone leans against government,<br />\nment, by its very nature, leans against<br />\neveryone. We have reached a point<br />\nwhere those who can only lean vastly<br />\noutnumber those capable of being<br />\nleaned against and the social structure totters like a building collapsing<br />\nunder too much weight. In the whole<br />\nfantastic picture nothing stands up<br />\nstraight and our economic surroundings whirl dizzily like blurred figures<br />\nin a nightmare.<br />\nSays Everything Paradox<br />\nEverything seems paradox.

The Big Drive<br />\nwill do more for anti-war propaganda<br />\nthan all the pacifists in Maryland.<br /><br />\n\"All Parts Of Entity\"<br />\nBut, if I were asked what the most<br />\nimportant influence is, I would say<br />\nwithout hesitation the development of<br />\na realization that the interests of all<br />\nthe Schools, all the departments of<br />\nthe University are the same, that anything affecting one affects all, that<br />\nthey are all parts of one entity, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. No one<br />\nSchool stands alone. The Faculty of<br />\nPhilosophy has been, is now and forever must be the center of the University, without it there is no University; and its interests are a matter of<br />\nthe deepest concern to all other parts<br />\nof the institution. The same is true,<br />\nif possible to a less degree, of all the<br />\nother faculties. A realization of this<br />\nmutual dependence and mutual interest is vital for the spiritual well being<br />\nof -the University. The inner life of<br />\nthe institution is most sensitive to destructive influences.

She uses no ropes, no ladder! A phenomenal leap for a woman ,or a man!<br />\nEXPLANATION:<br />\nJosie didn't jump...she was strung! The twenty-foot leap<br />\nis not dependent on Josie's ability, but on a powerful spring<br />\nmechanism hidden beneath the stage which propels the artist<br />\nupward through the air. The force is so violent that the lady<br />\nwears a light steel jacket which protects her from injury as<br />\nthe starts her astonishing leap.<br /><br />\nTickets May Be $12.50<br /><br />\nTickets to undergraduates for the<br />\nentire June Week are to be sold at<br />\n$12.50, according to tentative plans<br />\nof the group in charge.

By blending. And by the quality<br />\nof tobaccos used.<br />\nCheap,raw tobaccos can be \"built<br />\nup\" or \"fortified\" by the lavish use<br />\nof artificial flavorings.<br /><br />\nKEPT FRESH<br />\nIN THE WELDED<br />\nHUMIDOR PACK<br /><br />\nSuch magic, however, seldom holds<br />\nthe audience. Your taste finally tells<br />\nyou the truth.<br />\nThe cigarette flavor that never stales,<br />\nnever varies, never loses its fresh appeal,comes from mild, ripe,fragrant,<br />\nmore extensive tobaccos...blended to<br />\nbring out the full,round flavor of each<br />\ntype of leaf. It's the quality ofthe tobacco that counts!<br />\nIt is a fact, well known by<br />\nleaf tobacco experts,that<br />\nCamels are made from finer,<br />\nMORE EXPENSIVE tobaccos than<br />\nany other popular brand.<br /><br />\nBecause Camel actually pays millions<br />\nmore every year for choice tobaccos,<br />\nyou find in Camels an appealing mildness, a better flavor.<br />\nAnd Camels taste cooler because<br />\nthe welded Humidor Pack of threeply, MOISTURE-PROOF cellophane<br />\nkeeps them fresh.<br /><br />\nCopyright, 1933, It.
