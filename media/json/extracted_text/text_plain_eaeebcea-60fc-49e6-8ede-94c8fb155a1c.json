Deplorable as this situation is, it is at least<br />\nexplainable when one remembers that Hopkins is primarily<br />\na graduate and research-oriented institution.

Almost every group in the SAC can tell of a time<br />\nwhen its request for Plant-Op services has been treated<br />\nwith about as much seriousness as Melvin Perkin's campaign speeches. Many is the time a group has arrived at its<br />\nappointed room only to find the place either set up<br />\nincorrectly, not set up at all, or looking like the aftermath<br />\nof a News-Letter party.

This attitude invariably manifests itself<br />\nas an acceptance of the status<br />\nquo as the \"natural\" order of<br />\nsociety and assumes that, somehow \"we\" deserve more than<br />\n\"them.\" A sense of paternalism<br />\nis also common; we give to<br />\ncharities and support liberal<br />\ncauses when the occasion suits<br />\nus, but we can't understand, and<br />\nare shocked whenever the class<br />\ndistinctions in our society manifest themselves as provocation<br />\nand/or violence. His ideas on<br />\nimproving campus security and<br />\non advising innocent freshmen 1<br />\nto steer clear of the combat<br />\nzones is typical of liberal palliatives which are designed to<br />\nobscure the real problems of<br />\nsociety. The essential question<br />\nto be answered is not how to<br />\nprevent students from being<br />\nharassed, but rather how to<br />\neliminate the root social causes<br />\nof frustration and violence. The<br />\nsad thing is that any serious<br />\nattack on the real origins of<br />\nsocial problems would necessarily involve a questioning and<br />\ncritical examination of the class<br />\nnature of our society which<br />\nwould undoubtedly prove a little<br />\ntoo uncomfortable for the most<br />\ninfluential groups in society,<br />\nthat is, those who enjoy \"upper<br />\nmiddle class prosperity.\"<br />\nChris Campbell<br />\n<br />\nPub Production<br />\nRoom Proposed<br />\ncont. from p. 3<br />\nis hesitant to invest money in a<br />\nbuilding which is supposed to be<br />\ntorn down.

To them the city serves mainly as a mailing<br />\naddress to which Dad sends the weekly check and care<br />\npackage. The town citizens, or \"Baltimorons,\" mostly<br />\nget in the way at Eddie's or the Rite Aid, but sometimes<br />\nthey're fun to gawk at, especially in Hampden.<br />\nAll that, however, has changed this year, thanks<br />\nto a growing phenomenon known as Oriole Fever.<br />\nHoppies who once sported Yankee or Red Sox caps have<br />\nexchanged them - at least temporarily - for Oriole caps.<br />\nThe contagion that has been spreading throughout<br />\nBaltimore these past five months has somehow infected<br />\nthe Hopkins campus (which is, after all, mere blocks<br />\nfrom the source of this celebrated Fever). Even Howard<br />\nCosell knows that the Orioles have the best record, the<br />\nbest manager, the best pitching staff, the best defense,<br />\nthe best team in baseball. Whereas in past years' Levering Cafeteria chatter the Orioles were respected, now<br />\n<br />\nwith the crowds they draw, the Red Sox could easily<br />\nbuild and fill a massive, astroturfed,impersonal, perfectly symmetrical sports palace somewhere in the suburbs<br />\nof Boston. That they have yet to do so is to their<br />\nimmense credit. The team features an awesome line-up<br />\nof hitters; of course, their pitching, in a word, sucks.<br />\nYes, Virginia, pitching is indeed 90% of the game. The<br />\nBaltimore O's are proof of that trusty bromide (even<br />\nthough they gave up ten runs last night).<br />\nLet's jump leagues for a moment. As Joe the<br />\nlibrary maintenance man would say, \"How 'bout dem<br />\nEggspos?\" Montreal has a team not unlike the Orioles;<br />\nboth squads win with a combination of strong pitching<br />\nand timely hitting. Nonetheless, the jingo in me says the<br />\n;'s something unsavory about<br />\nExpos must not win! Ther,<br />\nthe thought of the World Series winners residing beyond<br />\nthe sacred borders of the United States. Granted,<br />\nCanada'sla lovely place, and they're our-next door neighbors and all that, but somehow it just seems wrong. Try<br />\nto imagine the Statue of Liberty in Rumania. Picture<br />\nthe Liberty Bell in Norway. Fancy the Golden Gate<br />\nBridge in Guam. Not very pretty thoughts, are they?<br />\nOn the other hand, I don't mind envisioning a<br />\nWorld Series/someday pitting Montreal against Toronto,<br />\nsimply for the sake of baseball commissioner Bowie<br />\nKuhn. I would love to see King Bowie enthroned in his<br />\nbox at Montreal's Olympic Stadium while snow falls and<br />\nwinds gust. I can see Bowie as we all saw him on TV<br />\ntwo years ago, in his suit jacket (no overcoat!), freezing<br />\nhis buns off and chattering through his teeth,<br />\n\"W-w-w-whaddya m-m-mean it's c-c-c-c-cold?\" No one<br />\nbetter try telling Kuhn that late October is no time to be<br />\nplaying night baseball. For that matter, don't try telling<br />\nthe moguls of the TV networks, either.<br />\nA pessimistic Oriole fan I know says, \"Wouldn't<br />\nit be just like a Baltimore team to bear the distinction of<br />\nbeing the first to lose to a Canadian team in the World<br />\nSeries? I mean, we lost to the Jets, then the Mets. Just<br />\nwatch. I'll bet it happens.\" Now that's what I call a<br />\nreal fan.

What a festival for the senses that<br />\nwas! The green field, the yelling, the hot dogs, the<br />\ncaramel corn, the cigar smoke. I threw up all over<br />\nmyself. My brother dragged me to the men's room and<br />\ndecided that my vomit-splattered shirt was beyond<br />\nsalvation; so he flushed it down the toilet. No one has<br />\nto persuade me to love the Orioles. I've invested sixteen<br />\nyears of love into this team. And one shirt.<br />\nGordon Beard of the Associated Press has been<br />\ntaking notes on the Orioles all season, and will doubtless<br />\ncome out with a book this winter. 1, lacking the faith<br />\nand foresight of Mr. Beard, have been taking notes on<br />\nthe Orioles since two Sundays ago. No book here, I<br />\nadmit, but at least a modest little piece suitable for the<br />\nschool paper. Voila! I apologize ahead of time to<br />\nanyone who feels put off by some of the baseball lingo<br />\nin my journal; I realize that to some benighted souls, a<br />\n\"sacrifice fly\" is a kamikaze insect.<br />\nIf anyone has any questions to ask or bones to<br />\npick (hell hath no fury like a fan whose team hath been<br />\nscorned), then he or she should feel free to call me at the<br />\nNews-Letter office, extension 7648. But don't try to<br />\nreach me this Wednesday night or Thursday afternoon,<br />\nbecause I won't be in; I'll be several blocks away, at a<br />\nbaseball game.<br />\nSUNDAY,SEPTEMBER 16,1979<br />\nThe Red Sox blew the Orioles away last night,<br />\n10-2. As much as people (myself included) talk about<br />\nBoston's amazing propensity for fading, folding, and<br />\nflopping every September, I still admire the team.<br />\nTheirs is one of the more historic franchises, and they<br />\nplay in what is probably the nicest stadium in the<br />\nmajors. (One of my primary goals in life, at this moment, is to see a baseball game in Fenway Park). And<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 -.<br />\n<br />\ncnc<br />\n<br />\nUl 1.110 111U111111 . 1 J7J ZLO.<br />\n<br />\nThat's an average of 23,459 per game. This past weekend's three-game series with the Bosox drew 135,519, for<br />\nan average of 45,173. 45,000! If they're lucky, the<br />\nOakland A's might draw that many at home for an entire<br />\nseason. Admittedly, we in Baltimore can't afford to get<br />\ntoo self-righteousiover one great year at the turnstiles.<br />\nAs recently as two years ago (when the Birds and Red<br />\n2 games<br />\n/<br />\nSox finished in a two-way tie for second place, 21<br />\nbehind the Yankees), the Oriole faithful numbered a<br />\nminiscule 3,300 at a September game. True, our opponents that night were the lowly Toronto Blue Jays, and it<br />\nmay have been a chilly evening, but it was after all the<br />\npennant stretch. I like to think those days are behind<br />\nus, those lonely days when the average age of those in<br />\nattendance at the stadium was seventy-nine. I'm greatly<br />\nencouraged by the youthful throngs that now come out<br />\nto the ballpark on a regular basis. These young, vociferous, and often poetic fans (\"C'mon, Ken/Put it in the<br />\nbullpen,\" \"Over the fences/Doug DeCinces,\" etc.) are<br />\n<br />\nthe foundation for the future. They, more than anything or anyone else, will determine whether the Orioles<br />\nstay in Baltimore or move down the expressway to that<br />\nother place.<br />\nIn yesterday's 13-3 pasting of the woebegone<br />\nBosox, Jim \"Pancakes\" Palmer pitched four and<br />\ntwo-thirds innings of perfect ball. Is 'Cakes in real<br />\nphysical discomfort or is his difficulty strictly in his<br />\nnoggin? That question apparently hasn't nagged as<br />\nmany people as usual with the way the other Oriole<br />\npitchers have been performing. Palmer's a funny guy; I<br />\nthink he thinks he belongs in a town like New York or<br />\nLos Angeles. Those are cities more suited to superstars,<br />\none of which Jim undoubtedly is. Yet Palmer remains, I<br />\nbelieve, just insecure enough (and intelligent enough) to<br />\nwant to stay right where he is. He realizes that no other<br />\nmanager but Earl Weaver would afford his arm (or his<br />\nhead) the treatment it seems to require.<br />\nSometimes I feel sorry for Jim. (I can just hear<br />\ndozens of voices exploding: \"What?!?!\") He is a brilliant individual performer on baseball's best team (a<br />\nbasically faceless team, by the way). That plus the fact<br />\nthat he is older than most of his teammates must make<br />\nPalmer feel somewhat lonely and out of place at times,<br />\nsort of like B.B. King singing with the Vienna Boys<br />\nChoir. Sort of.<br />\nBoth the Dodgers and the Yankees were mathematically eliminated from their respective division races<br />\nyesterday.

The only other serious<br />\ncontender, in my book, is Don Baylor of the California<br />\nAngels. Both men's offensive stats are fairly even, but<br />\nKenny has handled both sides of the game, at the plate<br />\nand in the field, while Baylor has been used primarily as<br />\na designated hitter. C'mon, sportswriters of America,<br />\ngive it to Singy (who,as of this morning, has 35 homers,<br />\n110 runs batted in, a .303 average, the league lead in<br />\nwalks, and so on). Not to take anything away from Mr.<br />\nBaylor, of course. Heck, I wouldn't do that; the man's<br />\na former Oriole!<br />\nAfter last night's game, the Angels and Royals<br />\nmeet six more times this season (the Royals bombed<br />\nCalifornia last night, 16-4). I'm watching the American<br />\nLeague West race with some anxiety. Because the O's<br />\nhandled California pretty easily in both Anaheim and<br />\nBaltimore this year, I'm pulling for the Angels. Kansas<br />\nCity has always given the Birds trouble, and this year<br />\nwas no exception. KC. Wok three out of four the last<br />\ntime the two teams met, and that was in Baltimore. The<br />\nRoyals are near invincible on that pool table of theirs in<br />\nMissouri.<br />\nI hate the playoffs.

(At least<br />\nthey still have the Patriots).<br />\nTHURSDAY,SEPTEMBER 20,1979<br />\nThis morning a friend in the Library Reserve<br />\nRoom passed on \"two of the most ironic facts of the<br />\nbaseball season.\" I told him that I'd write them down in<br />\nmy journal, so here they are:<br />\n1) According to a New York sports columnist,<br />\nReggie \"The Straw That Stirs the Drink\" Jackson has<br />\nbeen dropping hints to the effect that he wouldn't mind<br />\nplaying ball next season for a certain team owned by<br />\nEdward Bennett Williams (and I don't mean the Washington Redskins). Reggie back in Baltimore? As my<br />\nReserve Room friend put it, \"N000 way!\" Reg just<br />\nwouldn't fit in with an easy-going team like the Orioles not that he fits anywhere else, mind you. Besides, no<br />\nfranchise, particularly the one in Charm City, would care<br />\nto pick up Jackson's contract. Hank Peters, the Birds'<br />\ngeneral manager, has in effect already Said, \"Thanks but<br />\nno thanks. We don't need Reggie to stir our drink.\"<br />\n(Sweet irony!) Talented though he may be, I wouldn't<br />\ntake Jackson back for all the Reggie Bars in the world.<br />\n2) The second of these two ironic facts concerns<br />\nthe respective ground crews of Baltimore and Chicago.<br />\nLate in August, you may recall, the Orioles and White<br />\nSox were forced to cancel two games of a four-game set<br />\nbecause of an unplayable field (even though the weather<br />\non both occasions was perfect). Comiskey Park had seen<br />\na rock concert and a 15-minute rain shower within the<br />\nspace of five days, and two ball games in a row had to be<br />\nscratched. Now let us move forward in time a bit, gentle<br />\nreaders. On September 5, Baltimore was clobbered by<br />\nTropical Storm David. The Orioles' ground crew kept<br />\nthe entire field covered during the storm; the next day<br />\n(\"Now get this,\" said my friend), the day after a minihurricane had sashayed around town, the field at Memorial Stadium was so dry that the ground crew had to<br />\nwater it down to make it playable!<br />\n\"Well,\" I said to my friend,\"what's the moral?\"<br />\n\"The moral is,\" he replied, jabbing my shoulder<br />\nwith his index finger,\"that the Orioles have not only the<br />\nbest team in baseball, but also the best ground crew in<br />\nbaseball!\"<br />\n\"I knew that,\" I said.<br />\n\"Well, then, what are you bugging me for? Huh?<br />\nGet away from me!\"<br />\nFRIDAY,SEPTEMBER 21,1979<br />\n\"We were lucky to split those four games with<br />\nDetroit,\" Al Bumbry said last night after the O's had<br />\nbeaten the Tigers 8-7. Well put, Al. Detroit has a<br />\ntough young team, and a good manager in Sparky<br />\nAnderson. They certainly have the hitting: Ron LeFiore has to be the best ex-con playing in the majors<br />\ntoday. If the Tigers could acquire a few good pitchers<br />\nover the winter, then I wouldn't be surprised to see them<br />\nin the playoffs next year or the year after that. But first<br />\nthey'll have to claw their way past the Birds, right, O's<br />\nfans?<br />\nTwo days ago I ordered my playoff tickets: $34<br />\nfor four tickets to the first two games. I'm getting<br />\npsyched, so psyched that I hardly realize I shelled out<br />\n$34 for four tickets. Four World Seriesiickets will cost<br />\n$48. Oh well, it's only money. (By the way, if any of<br />\nyou Chicago Cub fans would like to know how it feels to<br />\npurchase tickets for post-season play, then by all means<br />\ngive me a call. I'll even let you touch my stubs if you<br />\nwant.)<br />\nA few words of thanks should be extended to<br />\nradio station WFBR in Baltimore for their fine coverage<br />\nand promotion of the Orioles this year. In their first<br />\nseason with the Birds, FBR has done much to publicize<br />\nthe team and fuel Oriole Fever. See, they even have me<br />\nusing their catchy little phrases, like \"Oriole Fever\"<br />\nTom Marr, the newsman turned sportscaster, has been<br />\npretty awful, I'm sorry to say.

It's 1933 and you're<br />\nin a smoky jazz club in Harlem, or it's<br />\n1942 and you have your ear glued to<br />\nyour radio set.

Behind him strides a slim<br />\ncompanion similarly attired and three<br />\nwomen of varying sizes in sparkling<br />\nhot-hued dresses. What follows is an<br />\nenergetic celebration of the music and<br />\nplayful wit of Fats Waller laced with<br />\nvaudeville, slapstick, tap dancing, scat<br />\nsinging and jitterbugging.<br />\nAin't Misbehavin', winner of the songs like \"Spreadin' Rhythm Around,\"<br />\n1978 \"best musical show of the year in which Harlemites go for a summer<br />\naward\" has come to Baltimore's Morris A. stroll to show off their furs, and \"The<br />\nMechanic Theater.

Enhancing the informality of the<br />\nset, the actors often joke or point at the<br />\naudience and at one point, call on them<br />\nto sing the refrain of the song, \"Fat and<br />\nGreasy.\" No fragmentary plot threads its<br />\nway through the musical. Each of the 21<br />\nnumbers in Ain't Misbehavin' has its own<br />\nantics or brief drama; the inter-relations<br />\nof the actors remain fluid.<br />\nAin't Misbehavin' is foremost a<br />\nnostalgic musical. The songs collected<br />\nfrom Fats Waller's compositions and<br />\nrecordings date from between 1929 and<br />\n1943.

The<br />\nexhibition of prints by Jim Dine at the<br />\nBaltimore Art Museum clearly reveals the<br />\nartistic growth and change one such<br />\nfigure has undergone. On display are<br />\nworks spanning the 70's plus Some from<br />\n1961-64 when Dine was part of the New<br />\n<br />\nYork Pop art scene. ,Unlike most of his<br />\ncontemporaries, he is still working with<br />\nintaglio techniques (drypoint, etching,<br />\nengraving) to achieve certain qualities of<br />\nline and texture.<br />\nDine ia a visual poet, using objects<br />\nas sexual and psychological metaphor,<br />\nsometimes placing words and labels in<br />\npaintings to make a more direct poetic<br />\nstatement. Tools, hair, hearts, clothing ...<br />\nthese are the obsessive icons repeated<br />\nthroughout his work. Ever since his early<br />\ncareer, Dine has isolated man-made things<br />\n<br />\nthem all. Jackie Lowe and Debra Byrd<br />\noften assume a stiff-legged gate. McNeill<br />\nand Lowe's dance routines are often<br />\ncartoon-like in their gangly steps.<br />\nThere is no question that Ain't<br />\nMisbehavin' was planned and performed<br />\nwith care and skill. The many dance<br />\nroutines were outstanding and well<br />\nsynthesized and the vocals of the often<br />\ncomplex and fast moving lyrics were well<br />\nhandled. However, some of the background dialogue was muffled - perhaps<br />\nbecause of the sound system. The<br />\nimitations of Fats Waller and of the<br />\nsingers that recorded his songs were<br />\nprecise, but the slapstick, however, which<br />\nclearly pleased the audience, seemed<br />\noverdone and a little too cute. At these<br />\npoints, the unstrained energy of the<br />\nactors that carried the show along so well<br />\nseemed to overstep itself at times.<br />\nTo an avid Fats Waller fan, the<br />\nperformance mayseem stiff and may not<br />\nlive up to expectations. But then, no one<br />\nbut Fats himself could do this. Ain't<br />\nMisbehavin', an entertaining and very<br />\neffective recreation of Fats Waller and his<br />\nmusic in a popular tone, is also a valuable<br />\nreminder of music that is too often<br />\nforgotten and too seldom heard.<br />\n<br />\nAn Indian<br />\nIn Africa<br />\nBY VINAY LAL<br />\nNaipaul, Shiva.

He has<br />\nabsolutely no touch. except for the<br />\nhardest hard rock \u2014 a style Zeppelin<br />\nseems to be abandoning with this album.<br />\nThe other track on the album, \"I'm<br />\nGonna Crawl,\" is a slow, dirge-like blues<br />\nwhich would have been rather interesting<br />\nif a massive blast from a church organ<br />\nnear the end of the song hadn't spoiled<br />\nthe entire effect.<br />\nSo Led Zeppelin has its problems. In<br />\nthe three years since its last album,<br />\nPresence, much has happened in the<br />\nmusic world, and perhaps Jimmy Page<br />\n(who, despite outward appearances, is<br />\nstill very much Led Zeppelin's leader)<br />\nsenses that he has been surp-assed.

He<br />\naccrately portrays the Indian, representative of \"the impenetrability, the hermeticism of the Asian world,\" as a<br />\ndisruptive, outside element - the scourge<br />\nof blacks and whites alike. Consequently,<br />\nand regrettably, Naipaul rarely recognizes<br />\nthe Indian's stupendous achievements<br />\nin Africa. The Indian is \"seen only when<br />\nhe can be hated.\" However, with the<br />\nskillful caution of a chronicler, Naipaul<br />\ndisplays no qualms about blaming the<br />\nIndian for the deterioration of Asians<br />\ngenerally. Regardless of where he is, the<br />\nIndian is always first an Indian - his sense<br />\nof caste, community and spirituality<br />\nremains unstained and undiminished.<br />\nThe Indian, especially the young bride, is<br />\nvirtually inaccessible. As Naipaul points<br />\nout, \"(this inaccessibility) has been their<br />\ngreat strength, and their fatal weakness.\"<br />\n<br />\nPop Art<br />\ncont. from p. 1.1<br />\nbaud\" scrawled across the portrait's<br />\nforehead or \"ground\" written in jest<br />\nacross the bottom of an apocalyptic<br />\nglimpse of the Eiffel tower (\"Paris Smiles<br />\nin Darkness\"). Works like \"A Girl and<br />\nHer Dog\" appear to be little more than<br />\nelaboratesdoodles, but they are saved by<br />\nthe persistently appealing ideas they<br />\nsuggest. In his series of self-portraits,<br />\nDine invests himself with the haunted<br />\nlook of a madman or castaway; in different states of the etching, he appears<br />\nbearded, beardless, wearing a hat, surrounded by tulips, or nearly obliterated<br />\nby brushstrokes.<br />\nDine's latest works are puzzling.<br />\nHe seems to have adopted a much more<br />\ndirect and representational style and is<br />\nconcentrating on studies of the human<br />\nface and form instead of inanimate<br />\nobjects. \"Four Sheets From an Unfinished Nov.e1\".introduces four lovingly drawn<br />\ncharacters in search of a story. \"Portrait<br />\nof Nancy\" (1978) shows off Dine's<br />\nnew-found skill at filling a face with<br />\nexpression.<br />\nThese recent prints are<br />\ncharacterized by thick black lines, spare<br />\nuse of pale colors, and Dine's usual<br />\nsmudges and offhand marks. They often<br />\ncontain areas that look unfinished next to<br />\nhighly developed faces or hands.<br />\nAs we enter the 1980's it is<br />\ninteresting to examine the progress of the<br />\nartists of Jim Dine's generation, for their<br />\nart has been a continuous search for<br />\npersonal solutions to the problems given<br />\nthe artist by society.<br />\nElsewhere, \"tragedy arose because of<br />\nnon-reaction . . . because of what he<br />\nfailed to do.\" Indian society is so closed<br />\nthat Hindu men, in Africa and elsewhere,<br />\ngo to India to seek a \"bride of purity.\"<br />\nNaipaul describes 'African antipathy<br />\ntoward Asians as a \"servile inheritance,\" a<br />\nreflection of European antipathy toward<br />\nthe African. But he is quick to point out<br />\nthat the European not only subscribed to<br />\nbut invented the doctrine of Asian<br />\nexploitation and oppression.<br />\nAs long as Naipaul restricts his<br />\nobservations to Africans and Indians, his<br />\nbook remains refreshingly original. But<br />\nwhen he attempts to make broader<br />\nstatements about human nature in<br />\ngeneral, he runs into trouble. For example, his observation that the slave \"is a<br />\nborn conservative\" and yearns to be an<br />\noppressor himself, is no more than a<br />\ncommonplace. His comment that in<br />\nAfrica, \". . . for the poor, the semiskilled, the semi-literate, there is indeed<br />\nno future,\" falls into the familiar pitfall<br />\nof characterizing a happy or respectable<br />\nfuture in terms of material progress and<br />\nwealth. Naipaul would do well to keep<br />\nSolzhenitysn's bitter indictment of Western society (Harvard Address, 1978) in<br />\nmind.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / SEPTEMBER 28, 1979<br />\n<br />\n1979 Hopkins<br />\nDunkers Tops<br />\nBY PETER W. CHOO<br />\nThe Hopkins water polo<br />\nclub has seen its share of ups and<br />\ndowns since its inception eight<br />\nyears ago. The 1977 team had a<br />\nvery disappointing season,losing<br />\nits last four matches of the year,<br />\nbut 1978 turned out to be<br />\nsomewhat of a surprise.<br />\nWith the loss of several key<br />\nplayers, last year's team was<br />\nthought to be weak in several<br />\npositions such as goalie and<br />\ndefense. However, Bill Sick, Bill<br />\nSmiddy and Colin Chinn combined with Wynn McCloskey to<br />\ngive the team a strong offense<br />\nwhile Mark Wolfram teamed<br />\nwith Brian Kutsunai, John<br />\nOlsen, Ron Wellman and Dean<br />\nBuchenauer to shore up the<br />\ndefense. But the biggest boost<br />\nto that year's team had to be<br />\nSteve Long, who virtually came<br />\nup from nowhere to become the<br />\nbest goalie on the East Coast<br />\nin NCAA Division II.<br />\nDespite an overall record of<br />\n7 and 6, the team won when it<br />\nhad to, and took second at the<br />\nMid-Atlantic Water Polo Conferbehind<br />\nence Championship<br />\nMonmouth College of New<br />\nJersey. By virtue of their second<br />\nplace finish, Hopkins gained<br />\nentrance into the NCAA Division II East Coast championship<br />\nwhere it went 2 and 1 to take<br />\nthird place.<br />\nThe 1978 season was also<br />\nthe last one for Smiddy, Sick,<br />\nChinn, Wolfram and several<br />\nothers, leaving this year's water<br />\npolo team in much the same<br />\nposition as 1978's at the beginning of last season. Co-captains<br />\nSteve Long and Brain Kutsunai<br />\nwill be leading a very young<br />\nteam into the 1979 season.<br />\n<br />\nLong, Kutsunai and McCloskey<br />\nare the only seniors on this<br />\nyear's team, which includes six<br />\nfreshmen. Because water polo<br />\ninvolves shuffling swimmers in<br />\nand out of the match,coach Bob<br />\nSummers expects to use many of<br />\nhis younger players. In particular, he is expecting major contributions from sophomore Jeff<br />\nSalmore and freshmen Jeff<br />\nMilnes and Tom Newburger,<br />\nboth of whom have played water<br />\npolo before in high school.<br />\nToday's pre-season tournament being held at the White<br />\nAthletic Center (schedule below)<br />\nwill include strong teams from<br />\nWashington & Lee and Navy, in<br />\naddition to Hopkins. Although<br />\nthe Hopkins team will be out<br />\nthere to win, their matches this<br />\nweekend will also be an important tune-up for what will follow<br />\nin October. Many freshmen<br />\nwill be in their first water polo<br />\nmatch ever; so the exposure to<br />\ncollegiate competition and the<br />\nexperience that will be gained by<br />\nplaying with their teammates as<br />\na unit will prove to be invaluable.<br />\nThis year's team, though<br />\nsimilar to last year's in many<br />\nways, is unique in that its<br />\nsuccess will depend on the<br />\nyounger players on the squad,<br />\nmany of whom will be in a<br />\nposition to make an immediate<br />\ncontribution. This year's starting team may very well have two<br />\nstarting freshmen. Though injuries will be important, the<br />\ntelling factors for the 1979<br />\nwater polo team will be leadership of the captains, and the<br />\npoise and character of the team<br />\nto meet the challenges of the<br />\n1979 season and keep the<br />\nmomentum going.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"c\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSophomore ';wimmer Jeff Salmore takes careful aim.<br />\n<br />\nHarriers Shine<br />\n<br />\nWomen Dominate MAC<br />\n<br />\nfor 3 years in his capacity as<br />\nhead track coach at Hopkins.<br />\nWhen Women's Cross Coun- He is also Women's Fencing<br />\ntry Coach Gary Green approach- coach, a position he has held for<br />\ned Bob Scott before last season 5 years.

Deplorable as this situation is, it is at least<br />\nexplainable when one remembers that Hopkins is primarily<br />\na graduate and research-oriented institution. What boggles<br />\nthe mind is the fact that this foul brew of academic elitism<br />\ncould trickle down through the various strata of the<br />\nitself in, of all places,<br />\nUniversity until it manifests<br />\nPlant Operations.<br />\nThe recent record of Plant Operations in dealing with<br />\nundergraduates has been extremely cavalier, to put it<br />\nmildly. Almost every group in the SAC can tell of a time<br />\nwhen its request for Plant-Op services has been treated<br />\nwith about as much seriousness as Melvin Perkin's campaign speeches. Many is the time a group has arrived at its<br />\nappointed room only to find the place either set up<br />\nincorrectly, not set up at all, or looking like the aftermath<br />\nof a News-Letter party. The attitude of Plant-Op director<br />\nWilliam Campbell seems to be that undergraduates are a<br />\nhardy lot, and perfectly capable of toting their own<br />\nfurniture to and fro about the campus.<br />\nWe're aware that we could use the exercise, Bill -- but<br />\nin case you've forgotten, we flabbies pay your equally fat<br />\nsalary.<br />\nBeing given the cold shoulder by Plant-Op leads to<br />\nmore than just inconvenience. When Hurricane David<br />\ndecided to punish Baltimore for re-electing Mayor Schaeffer, our beloved Gatehouse was flooded with a silty ocean<br />\nfrom the Art Museum's Sculpture Bomb-Crater. Despite<br />\nthe fact that our basement houses over $80,000 worth of<br />\nhighly sensitive, non-waterproof I.B.M. equipment, the<br />\neditors who urgently phoned for assistance.while trying to<br />\nbalance linotype machines on their heads were igpored...as if.<br />\nthey had called to ask if the janitors had Prince Albert M a<br />\ncan.<br />\nConsidering all the help and support the janitors<br />\nreceived from the undergraduates last year during the<br />\n\"Shift-Shaft\" affair, it seems only reasonable that we<br />\nshould get fair treatment in return. It is our firm suspicion<br />\nthat the current negative attitude toward undergraduates<br />\nhas its origins not in the rank and file of the Plant-Op<br />\nstaff, but rather in its consistantly rank supervisors.<br /><br />\nFrat Strategy<br />\nAs it turns out, house-wife-politico Mary Pat Clarke<br />\nhas been forced to rewrite her pernicious AntiFrat Bill.<br />\nApparently the wording of the legislation was as sloppy as<br />\nher thought processes, rendering it ineligible to be voted<br />\non come Oct. 8. Anything which throws a wrench into her<br />\ngears is just dandy with us, but the fraternities shouldn't<br />\nlet Clarke's bumbling lull them into a false sense of security.<br />\nWhat the frats have to do is take the offensive-- in an<br />\ninoffensive wasy. For instance: A few years ago they<br />\noffered an escort service to Hopkins women at night,<br />\nwhich for some reason was discontinued. It is obvious<br />\nfrom the recent rash of assaults and rapes in the Ho'mewood area that such a program is desperately needed<br />\ntoday. This is just the kind of PR that the frats need, and<br />\njust the kind of community service that will make Mrs.<br />\nClarke's vacuous arguments look even sillier than they do<br />\nalready.<br /><br />\nThe School for Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies is very<br />\nmuch like a pleasant small town.<br />\nPhysically, it is tiny, occupying<br />\nonly a very small office building.<br />\nIt is not at all hard to see the<br />\ntown Administrators -- they are<br />\nnot far off Garland Hall type,<br />\nbut reside on the second floor,<br />\nThe<br />\nofficials,<br />\nsurprisingly<br />\nenough, listen to student views,<br />\nand the SAIS Registrai and<br />\nStudent Government could not<br />\nbe more helpful. SAIS even has<br />\nits own money, in the form of<br />\ncoupons used at the SAIS<br />\ncafeteria, which is a grade or two<br />\nabove Servomation. Because<br />\nthis is a small town graduate<br />\nschool, few of the students<br />\ndisplay the callous pretension so<br />\ncommon at big city Homewood.<br />\nThen<br />\nthere<br />\nare<br />\nthe<br />\nAB-MA's. The AB-MA's are an<br />\nodd sort, permanently cast adrift<br />\nin a bureaucratic limbo.

This attitude invariably manifests itself<br />\nas an acceptance of the status<br />\nquo as the \"natural\" order of<br />\nsociety and assumes that, somehow \"we\" deserve more than<br />\n\"them.\" A sense of paternalism<br />\nis also common; we give to<br />\ncharities and support liberal<br />\ncauses when the occasion suits<br />\nus, but we can't understand, and<br />\nare shocked whenever the class<br />\ndistinctions in our society manifest themselves as provocation<br />\nand/or violence.

To them the city serves mainly as a mailing<br />\naddress to which Dad sends the weekly check and care<br />\npackage. The town citizens, or \"Baltimorons,\" mostly<br />\nget in the way at Eddie's or the Rite Aid, but sometimes<br />\nthey're fun to gawk at, especially in Hampden.<br />\nAll that, however, has changed this year, thanks<br />\nto a growing phenomenon known as Oriole Fever.<br />\nHoppies who once sported Yankee or Red Sox caps have<br />\nexchanged them - at least temporarily - for Oriole caps.<br />\nThe contagion that has been spreading throughout<br />\nBaltimore these past five months has somehow infected<br />\nthe Hopkins campus (which is, after all, mere blocks<br />\nfrom the source of this celebrated Fever). Even Howard<br />\nCosell knows that the Orioles have the best record, the<br />\nbest manager, the best pitching staff, the best defense,<br />\nthe best team in baseball. Whereas in past years' Levering Cafeteria chatter the Orioles were respected, now<br /><br />\nwith the crowds they draw, the Red Sox could easily<br />\nbuild and fill a massive, astroturfed,impersonal, perfectly symmetrical sports palace somewhere in the suburbs<br />\nof Boston. That they have yet to do so is to their<br />\nimmense credit. The team features an awesome line-up<br />\nof hitters; of course, their pitching, in a word, sucks.<br />\nYes, Virginia, pitching is indeed 90% of the game. The<br />\nBaltimore O's are proof of that trusty bromide (even<br />\nthough they gave up ten runs last night).<br />\nLet's jump leagues for a moment. As Joe the<br />\nlibrary maintenance man would say, \"How 'bout dem<br />\nEggspos?\" Montreal has a team not unlike the Orioles;<br />\nboth squads win with a combination of strong pitching<br />\nand timely hitting. Nonetheless, the jingo in me says the<br />\n;'s something unsavory about<br />\nExpos must not win! Ther,<br />\nthe thought of the World Series winners residing beyond<br />\nthe sacred borders of the United States. Granted,<br />\nCanada'sla lovely place, and they're our-next door neighbors and all that, but somehow it just seems wrong. Try<br />\nto imagine the Statue of Liberty in Rumania. Picture<br />\nthe Liberty Bell in Norway. Fancy the Golden Gate<br />\nBridge in Guam. Not very pretty thoughts, are they?<br />\nOn the other hand, I don't mind envisioning a<br />\nWorld Series/someday pitting Montreal against Toronto,<br />\nsimply for the sake of baseball commissioner Bowie<br />\nKuhn. I would love to see King Bowie enthroned in his<br />\nbox at Montreal's Olympic Stadium while snow falls and<br />\nwinds gust. I can see Bowie as we all saw him on TV<br />\ntwo years ago, in his suit jacket (no overcoat!), freezing<br />\nhis buns off and chattering through his teeth,<br />\n\"W-w-w-whaddya m-m-mean it's c-c-c-c-cold?\" No one<br />\nbetter try telling Kuhn that late October is no time to be<br />\nplaying night baseball. For that matter, don't try telling<br />\nthe moguls of the TV networks, either.<br />\nA pessimistic Oriole fan I know says, \"Wouldn't<br />\nit be just like a Baltimore team to bear the distinction of<br />\nbeing the first to lose to a Canadian team in the World<br />\nSeries?

What a festival for the senses that<br />\nwas! The green field, the yelling, the hot dogs, the<br />\ncaramel corn, the cigar smoke. I threw up all over<br />\nmyself. My brother dragged me to the men's room and<br />\ndecided that my vomit-splattered shirt was beyond<br />\nsalvation; so he flushed it down the toilet. No one has<br />\nto persuade me to love the Orioles. I've invested sixteen<br />\nyears of love into this team. And one shirt.<br />\nGordon Beard of the Associated Press has been<br />\ntaking notes on the Orioles all season, and will doubtless<br />\ncome out with a book this winter. 1, lacking the faith<br />\nand foresight of Mr. Beard, have been taking notes on<br />\nthe Orioles since two Sundays ago. No book here, I<br />\nadmit, but at least a modest little piece suitable for the<br />\nschool paper. Voila! I apologize ahead of time to<br />\nanyone who feels put off by some of the baseball lingo<br />\nin my journal; I realize that to some benighted souls, a<br />\n\"sacrifice fly\" is a kamikaze insect.<br />\nIf anyone has any questions to ask or bones to<br />\npick (hell hath no fury like a fan whose team hath been<br />\nscorned), then he or she should feel free to call me at the<br />\nNews-Letter office, extension 7648. But don't try to<br />\nreach me this Wednesday night or Thursday afternoon,<br />\nbecause I won't be in; I'll be several blocks away, at a<br />\nbaseball game.<br />\nSUNDAY,SEPTEMBER 16,1979<br />\nThe Red Sox blew the Orioles away last night,<br />\n10-2. As much as people (myself included) talk about<br />\nBoston's amazing propensity for fading, folding, and<br />\nflopping every September, I still admire the team.<br />\nTheirs is one of the more historic franchises, and they<br />\nplay in what is probably the nicest stadium in the<br />\nmajors. (One of my primary goals in life, at this moment, is to see a baseball game in Fenway Park). And<br /><br />\n\u2022 -.<br /><br />\ncnc<br /><br />\nUl 1.110 111U111111 . 1 J7J ZLO.<br /><br />\nThat's an average of 23,459 per game. This past weekend's three-game series with the Bosox drew 135,519, for<br />\nan average of 45,173. 45,000! If they're lucky, the<br />\nOakland A's might draw that many at home for an entire<br />\nseason. Admittedly, we in Baltimore can't afford to get<br />\ntoo self-righteousiover one great year at the turnstiles.<br />\nAs recently as two years ago (when the Birds and Red<br />\n2 games<br />\n/<br />\nSox finished in a two-way tie for second place, 21<br />\nbehind the Yankees), the Oriole faithful numbered a<br />\nminiscule 3,300 at a September game. True, our opponents that night were the lowly Toronto Blue Jays, and it<br />\nmay have been a chilly evening, but it was after all the<br />\npennant stretch. I like to think those days are behind<br />\nus, those lonely days when the average age of those in<br />\nattendance at the stadium was seventy-nine. I'm greatly<br />\nencouraged by the youthful throngs that now come out<br />\nto the ballpark on a regular basis. These young, vociferous, and often poetic fans (\"C'mon, Ken/Put it in the<br />\nbullpen,\" \"Over the fences/Doug DeCinces,\" etc.) are<br /><br />\nthe foundation for the future. They, more than anything or anyone else, will determine whether the Orioles<br />\nstay in Baltimore or move down the expressway to that<br />\nother place.<br />\nIn yesterday's 13-3 pasting of the woebegone<br />\nBosox, Jim \"Pancakes\" Palmer pitched four and<br />\ntwo-thirds innings of perfect ball. Is 'Cakes in real<br />\nphysical discomfort or is his difficulty strictly in his<br />\nnoggin? That question apparently hasn't nagged as<br />\nmany people as usual with the way the other Oriole<br />\npitchers have been performing. Palmer's a funny guy; I<br />\nthink he thinks he belongs in a town like New York or<br />\nLos Angeles. Those are cities more suited to superstars,<br />\none of which Jim undoubtedly is. Yet Palmer remains, I<br />\nbelieve, just insecure enough (and intelligent enough) to<br />\nwant to stay right where he is. He realizes that no other<br />\nmanager but Earl Weaver would afford his arm (or his<br />\nhead) the treatment it seems to require.<br />\nSometimes I feel sorry for Jim. (I can just hear<br />\ndozens of voices exploding: \"What?!?!\") He is a brilliant individual performer on baseball's best team (a<br />\nbasically faceless team, by the way). That plus the fact<br />\nthat he is older than most of his teammates must make<br />\nPalmer feel somewhat lonely and out of place at times,<br />\nsort of like B.B.

The only other serious<br />\ncontender, in my book, is Don Baylor of the California<br />\nAngels. Both men's offensive stats are fairly even, but<br />\nKenny has handled both sides of the game, at the plate<br />\nand in the field, while Baylor has been used primarily as<br />\na designated hitter. C'mon, sportswriters of America,<br />\ngive it to Singy (who,as of this morning, has 35 homers,<br />\n110 runs batted in, a .303 average, the league lead in<br />\nwalks, and so on).

(At least<br />\nthey still have the Patriots).<br />\nTHURSDAY,SEPTEMBER 20,1979<br />\nThis morning a friend in the Library Reserve<br />\nRoom passed on \"two of the most ironic facts of the<br />\nbaseball season.\" I told him that I'd write them down in<br />\nmy journal, so here they are:<br />\n1) According to a New York sports columnist,<br />\nReggie \"The Straw That Stirs the Drink\" Jackson has<br />\nbeen dropping hints to the effect that he wouldn't mind<br />\nplaying ball next season for a certain team owned by<br />\nEdward Bennett Williams (and I don't mean the Washington Redskins). Reggie back in Baltimore? As my<br />\nReserve Room friend put it, \"N000 way!\" Reg just<br />\nwouldn't fit in with an easy-going team like the Orioles not that he fits anywhere else, mind you. Besides, no<br />\nfranchise, particularly the one in Charm City, would care<br />\nto pick up Jackson's contract. Hank Peters, the Birds'<br />\ngeneral manager, has in effect already Said, \"Thanks but<br />\nno thanks. We don't need Reggie to stir our drink.\"<br />\n(Sweet irony!) Talented though he may be, I wouldn't<br />\ntake Jackson back for all the Reggie Bars in the world.<br />\n2) The second of these two ironic facts concerns<br />\nthe respective ground crews of Baltimore and Chicago.<br />\nLate in August, you may recall, the Orioles and White<br />\nSox were forced to cancel two games of a four-game set<br />\nbecause of an unplayable field (even though the weather<br />\non both occasions was perfect). Comiskey Park had seen<br />\na rock concert and a 15-minute rain shower within the<br />\nspace of five days, and two ball games in a row had to be<br />\nscratched. Now let us move forward in time a bit, gentle<br />\nreaders. On September 5, Baltimore was clobbered by<br />\nTropical Storm David. The Orioles' ground crew kept<br />\nthe entire field covered during the storm; the next day<br />\n(\"Now get this,\" said my friend), the day after a minihurricane had sashayed around town, the field at Memorial Stadium was so dry that the ground crew had to<br />\nwater it down to make it playable!<br />\n\"Well,\" I said to my friend,\"what's the moral?\"<br />\n\"The moral is,\" he replied, jabbing my shoulder<br />\nwith his index finger,\"that the Orioles have not only the<br />\nbest team in baseball, but also the best ground crew in<br />\nbaseball!\"<br />\n\"I knew that,\" I said.<br />\n\"Well, then, what are you bugging me for? Huh?<br />\nGet away from me!\"<br />\nFRIDAY,SEPTEMBER 21,1979<br />\n\"We were lucky to split those four games with<br />\nDetroit,\" Al Bumbry said last night after the O's had<br />\nbeaten the Tigers 8-7. Well put, Al. Detroit has a<br />\ntough young team, and a good manager in Sparky<br />\nAnderson. They certainly have the hitting: Ron LeFiore has to be the best ex-con playing in the majors<br />\ntoday. If the Tigers could acquire a few good pitchers<br />\nover the winter, then I wouldn't be surprised to see them<br />\nin the playoffs next year or the year after that. But first<br />\nthey'll have to claw their way past the Birds, right, O's<br />\nfans?<br />\nTwo days ago I ordered my playoff tickets: $34<br />\nfor four tickets to the first two games. I'm getting<br />\npsyched, so psyched that I hardly realize I shelled out<br />\n$34 for four tickets. Four World Seriesiickets will cost<br />\n$48. Oh well, it's only money. (By the way, if any of<br />\nyou Chicago Cub fans would like to know how it feels to<br />\npurchase tickets for post-season play, then by all means<br />\ngive me a call. I'll even let you touch my stubs if you<br />\nwant.)<br />\nA few words of thanks should be extended to<br />\nradio station WFBR in Baltimore for their fine coverage<br />\nand promotion of the Orioles this year. In their first<br />\nseason with the Birds, FBR has done much to publicize<br />\nthe team and fuel Oriole Fever. See, they even have me<br />\nusing their catchy little phrases, like \"Oriole Fever\"<br />\nTom Marr, the newsman turned sportscaster, has been<br />\npretty awful, I'm sorry to say.

I ought<br />\nto know, I used to date one. But if you are interested in<br />\nentering medical school, the interview can be important<br />\nto have. Have her quickly, then proceed with the<br />\ninterview.<br />\nFirst, know what to wear. Clothes are always<br />\nideal. Do not wear a '71 Chrysler (too flashy.) Wear a<br />\ndark suit or a print dress, but not at the same time.<br />\nTransexuals are usually not allowed in as students. Most<br />\nbecome administrators . . . Wear something that will set<br />\nyou apart, such as a head of lettuce or a chastity belt. A<br />\nbelt, in fact, never hurts, so have a quick belt before<br />\nentering the interviewer's office.<br />\ninterviewer<br />\nas<br />\nIf laughing, do not point at the<br />\nyou do so. Upon first seeing the medical school representative, do not scream. If the interviewer is old and<br />\nshakes, shake along; if he dribbles, do not place a bowl<br />\nin front of his face (this is a common mistake)--instead,<br />\ncasually mop the mess with a handy sheet of Bounty<br />\n(the quicker-picker-upper.) Should the interviewer die,<br />\ndo not let this interfere. Continue, but don't be pushy.<br />\nLet him know you care.<br />\nIt is important to smell nice. Do not smell like a<br />\nsalad or an ex-politician. If you have a distinct odor,<br />\nspice it up with a story. \"I always smell this way\"<br />\nsimply doesn't cut it. Pardon the pun. Do not chew<br />\ngum, tobacco or shoelaces. Open the interview with an<br />\namusing remark, such as \"Is it true what they say about'<br />\nyou.\" If he's pretty, relax. If he's pretty,leave immediately.<br />\nFind common ground. Don't merely answer<br />\nquestions - ask! \"Do you like little boys, too?\" is a<br />\nlovely eye-opener. Discuss interests outside the realm of<br />\nmedicine (Example: for women - \"Read Lolita? I was<br />\nLolita!\") Naturally, one may be wary of questions (it is<br />\nlikely that questions could be asked during an interview.<br />\nTry not to let this throw you.) When asked what school<br />\none attended, be careful -- this could be a trick question.<br />\nMost medical schools are searching for captivating<br />\npersonalities. Instead of responding with sensible<br />\nanswers, try gibberish or non sequiters. For example:<br />\nQ: Did you enjoy your undergraduate years?<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nA: Cacaphony. Excalibur.<br />\nQ: (to himself) Hmmmm<br />\njust what I'm<br />\nlooking for.<br />\nReally. This works. No,really.<br />\nPersonality traits should shine through. Let him<br />\nsee the child in you. Salivate on his desk (most adults<br />\nare vastly amused by spittle.) Say \"Blub blub goober\"<br />\nrepeatedly, or scream \"Yock-Tah!\" into his ears. Wear a<br />\npair of diapers outside your clothing. Tie him into his<br />\nchair and set fire to his feet. Whine. Don't eat your<br />\nspinach. Drink paint. Sharpen his Cross pens. Bring a<br />\njar of slugs; pour them on the floor.<br />\nIf asked about your transcript, refuse to answer.<br />\n\"What about yours,\" you may respond. Many schools<br />\nobject to \"Withdrawal\" on the transcript, so have<br />\nwithdrawals on his carpet. He will understand. Everyone is wary of one question: why do you want to be a<br />\ndoctor? Examine this. Examine it closely. Hold it<br />\nunder a light. Move to another room where the lights<br /><br />\nare better. Change the bulb. There!<br />\nBeing a doctor demands responsibility -- removing scissors from abdomens, removing competition from<br />\nclasses. Honesty works, so reply money, status and<br />\npressure. A sneaky grunt will not suffice.<br />\nEnding an interview can make or break your<br />\nfuture (so can a paternity suit. This is irrelevant.)<br />\nFollowing are several closing lines:<br />\n1) I have to wee-wee.<br />\n2) Two way stretch. The Burmese Harp.<br />\n3) Wasn't that Attila something!<br />\n4) You made me love you. I didn't want to do it.<br />\n5) I don't want to talk anymore.<br />\n6) I dunt wannah tawk no' mo'.<br />\n7) I wouldn't be caught dead in what you're<br />\nwearing.<br />\nIt is your honesty they are seeking.

It's 1933 and you're<br />\nin a smoky jazz club in Harlem, or it's<br />\n1942 and you have your ear glued to<br />\nyour radio set. Out he struts on a stage<br />\nbathed in purple light, a rotund figure<br />\nwith a toothy smile in a three-piece suit<br />\nand bowler. Behind him strides a slim<br />\ncompanion similarly attired and three<br />\nwomen of varying sizes in sparkling<br />\nhot-hued dresses. What follows is an<br />\nenergetic celebration of the music and<br />\nplayful wit of Fats Waller laced with<br />\nvaudeville, slapstick, tap dancing, scat<br />\nsinging and jitterbugging.<br />\nAin't Misbehavin', winner of the songs like \"Spreadin' Rhythm Around,\"<br />\n1978 \"best musical show of the year in which Harlemites go for a summer<br />\naward\" has come to Baltimore's Morris A. stroll to show off their furs, and \"The<br />\nMechanic Theater. Directed by Richard Joint is Jumpin',\" in which a jazz club is<br />\nMaltby Jr., winner of the 1978 Tony raided. War time radio is remembered in<br />\naward for the musical, Ain't Misbehavin' war effort songs like \"When the Nylons<br />\nhas been produced in London as well as Bloom Again\" and \"Cash for Your<br />\non Broadway and has circulated with two Trash,\" which feature parodies of the<br />\nAmerican touring companies. The men} ladies who sang with Fat's band.<br />\nThe sound of soft saxophones and<br />\nhers of this cast are drawn from some of<br />\nthe previous ones. Fats Waller is played muted trombones as well as the lyrics to<br />\nby Evan Bell from the London cast, his many of these songs are nostalgic even to<br />\ndancing and singing entourage by Debra those who never lived through the thirtByrd, Yvonne Kersey, Jackie Lowe and ies, but the wild dance steps and blunt<br />\nsexuality of many of the numbers may be<br />\nLonnie McNeill.<br />\na<br />\nAM't Misbehavin 's format is that of unexpected. In the comically stylized<br />\njazz review or cabaret. On the stage, a jitterbugs that Lowe and McNeill do<br />\njazz band under an arch of neon piano together in songs like \"How Ya Baby,\"<br />\nkeys, _a stand-up piano, and a cocktail their knees and elhows seem to break out<br />\ntable with chairs help create this atmo- of orbit. In \"The Jitterbug Waltz\", the<br />\nsphere. Enhancing the informality of the<br />\nset, the actors often joke or point at the<br />\naudience and at one point, call on them<br />\nto sing the refrain of the song, \"Fat and<br />\nGreasy.\" No fragmentary plot threads its<br />\nway through the musical. Each of the 21<br />\nnumbers in Ain't Misbehavin' has its own<br />\nantics or brief drama; the inter-relations<br />\nof the actors remain fluid.<br />\nAin't Misbehavin' is foremost a<br />\nnostalgic musical. The songs collected<br />\nfrom Fats Waller's compositions and<br />\nrecordings date from between 1929 and<br />\n1943. We see Harlem in the twenties in<br /><br />\ncouple's snake-like movenients, bumps<br />\nand grinds, also exagerated for humor, are<br />\nalien to the image of shuffling couples<br />\nusually associated with the Ithirfies \"The<br />\nViper's Drag\" and \"The Reefer Song,\" a<br />\ndramatic dance scene by McNeill on a<br />\ndark street lit by cigarette lighters, is an<br />\nexultation of marijuana (\"I'm dreaming<br />\nof a reefer five feet long.\") For those of<br />\nus who never saw the thirties in person,<br />\nthe bright colors (purples, reds and<br />\noranges) disturb our preconceived black-and-white image of the time.<br />\nAlmost every song in Ain't Misbehavin' is played for laughs. In the constant<br />\nparody and exageration, the actors<br />\npresent themselves as cartoon characters.<br />\nYvonne Kersey, a flamboyant fat lady,<br />\nplays opposite slim Jackie Lowe and<br />\nLonnie McNeill. But Bell towers over<br /><br />\n/\\IRlr.5<br /><br />\nPop Art In the Seventies<br />\nBY MARK SKONER<br />\nAlmost 20 years have passed since<br />\nPop Art asserted itself in the early 1960's.<br />\nThe young artists who tried to challenge<br />\nevery definition of \"art\" have become<br />\nelder statesmen in today's art world. The<br />\nexhibition of prints by Jim Dine at the<br />\nBaltimore Art Museum clearly reveals the<br />\nartistic growth and change one such<br />\nfigure has undergone. On display are<br />\nworks spanning the 70's plus Some from<br />\n1961-64 when Dine was part of the New<br /><br />\nYork Pop art scene. ,Unlike most of his<br />\ncontemporaries, he is still working with<br />\nintaglio techniques (drypoint, etching,<br />\nengraving) to achieve certain qualities of<br />\nline and texture.<br />\nDine ia a visual poet, using objects<br />\nas sexual and psychological metaphor,<br />\nsometimes placing words and labels in<br />\npaintings to make a more direct poetic<br />\nstatement. Tools, hair, hearts, clothing ...<br />\nthese are the obsessive icons repeated<br />\nthroughout his work. Ever since his early<br />\ncareer, Dine has isolated man-made things<br /><br />\nthem all. Jackie Lowe and Debra Byrd<br />\noften assume a stiff-legged gate. McNeill<br />\nand Lowe's dance routines are often<br />\ncartoon-like in their gangly steps.<br />\nThere is no question that Ain't<br />\nMisbehavin' was planned and performed<br />\nwith care and skill. The many dance<br />\nroutines were outstanding and well<br />\nsynthesized and the vocals of the often<br />\ncomplex and fast moving lyrics were well<br />\nhandled. However, some of the background dialogue was muffled - perhaps<br />\nbecause of the sound system. The<br />\nimitations of Fats Waller and of the<br />\nsingers that recorded his songs were<br />\nprecise, but the slapstick, however, which<br />\nclearly pleased the audience, seemed<br />\noverdone and a little too cute. At these<br />\npoints, the unstrained energy of the<br />\nactors that carried the show along so well<br />\nseemed to overstep itself at times.<br />\nTo an avid Fats Waller fan, the<br />\nperformance mayseem stiff and may not<br />\nlive up to expectations. But then, no one<br />\nbut Fats himself could do this. Ain't<br />\nMisbehavin', an entertaining and very<br />\neffective recreation of Fats Waller and his<br />\nmusic in a popular tone, is also a valuable<br />\nreminder of music that is too often<br />\nforgotten and too seldom heard.<br /><br />\nAn Indian<br />\nIn Africa<br />\nBY VINAY LAL<br />\nNaipaul, Shiva.

He<br />\naccrately portrays the Indian, representative of \"the impenetrability, the hermeticism of the Asian world,\" as a<br />\ndisruptive, outside element - the scourge<br />\nof blacks and whites alike. Consequently,<br />\nand regrettably, Naipaul rarely recognizes<br />\nthe Indian's stupendous achievements<br />\nin Africa. The Indian is \"seen only when<br />\nhe can be hated.\" However, with the<br />\nskillful caution of a chronicler, Naipaul<br />\ndisplays no qualms about blaming the<br />\nIndian for the deterioration of Asians<br />\ngenerally. Regardless of where he is, the<br />\nIndian is always first an Indian - his sense<br />\nof caste, community and spirituality<br />\nremains unstained and undiminished.<br />\nThe Indian, especially the young bride, is<br />\nvirtually inaccessible. As Naipaul points<br />\nout, \"(this inaccessibility) has been their<br />\ngreat strength, and their fatal weakness.\"<br /><br />\nPop Art<br />\ncont. from p. 1.1<br />\nbaud\" scrawled across the portrait's<br />\nforehead or \"ground\" written in jest<br />\nacross the bottom of an apocalyptic<br />\nglimpse of the Eiffel tower (\"Paris Smiles<br />\nin Darkness\"). Works like \"A Girl and<br />\nHer Dog\" appear to be little more than<br />\nelaboratesdoodles, but they are saved by<br />\nthe persistently appealing ideas they<br />\nsuggest. In his series of self-portraits,<br />\nDine invests himself with the haunted<br />\nlook of a madman or castaway; in different states of the etching, he appears<br />\nbearded, beardless, wearing a hat, surrounded by tulips, or nearly obliterated<br />\nby brushstrokes.<br />\nDine's latest works are puzzling.<br />\nHe seems to have adopted a much more<br />\ndirect and representational style and is<br />\nconcentrating on studies of the human<br />\nface and form instead of inanimate<br />\nobjects. \"Four Sheets From an Unfinished Nov.e1\".introduces four lovingly drawn<br />\ncharacters in search of a story. \"Portrait<br />\nof Nancy\" (1978) shows off Dine's<br />\nnew-found skill at filling a face with<br />\nexpression.<br />\nThese recent prints are<br />\ncharacterized by thick black lines, spare<br />\nuse of pale colors, and Dine's usual<br />\nsmudges and offhand marks. They often<br />\ncontain areas that look unfinished next to<br />\nhighly developed faces or hands.<br />\nAs we enter the 1980's it is<br />\ninteresting to examine the progress of the<br />\nartists of Jim Dine's generation, for their<br />\nart has been a continuous search for<br />\npersonal solutions to the problems given<br />\nthe artist by society.<br />\nElsewhere, \"tragedy arose because of<br />\nnon-reaction . . . because of what he<br />\nfailed to do.\" Indian society is so closed<br />\nthat Hindu men, in Africa and elsewhere,<br />\ngo to India to seek a \"bride of purity.\"<br />\nNaipaul describes 'African antipathy<br />\ntoward Asians as a \"servile inheritance,\" a<br />\nreflection of European antipathy toward<br />\nthe African. But he is quick to point out<br />\nthat the European not only subscribed to<br />\nbut invented the doctrine of Asian<br />\nexploitation and oppression.<br />\nAs long as Naipaul restricts his<br />\nobservations to Africans and Indians, his<br />\nbook remains refreshingly original. But<br />\nwhen he attempts to make broader<br />\nstatements about human nature in<br />\ngeneral, he runs into trouble. For example, his observation that the slave \"is a<br />\nborn conservative\" and yearns to be an<br />\noppressor himself, is no more than a<br />\ncommonplace. His comment that in<br />\nAfrica, \". . . for the poor, the semiskilled, the semi-literate, there is indeed<br />\nno future,\" falls into the familiar pitfall<br />\nof characterizing a happy or respectable<br />\nfuture in terms of material progress and<br />\nwealth.

CHOO<br />\nThe Hopkins water polo<br />\nclub has seen its share of ups and<br />\ndowns since its inception eight<br />\nyears ago. The 1977 team had a<br />\nvery disappointing season,losing<br />\nits last four matches of the year,<br />\nbut 1978 turned out to be<br />\nsomewhat of a surprise.<br />\nWith the loss of several key<br />\nplayers, last year's team was<br />\nthought to be weak in several<br />\npositions such as goalie and<br />\ndefense. However, Bill Sick, Bill<br />\nSmiddy and Colin Chinn combined with Wynn McCloskey to<br />\ngive the team a strong offense<br />\nwhile Mark Wolfram teamed<br />\nwith Brian Kutsunai, John<br />\nOlsen, Ron Wellman and Dean<br />\nBuchenauer to shore up the<br />\ndefense. But the biggest boost<br />\nto that year's team had to be<br />\nSteve Long, who virtually came<br />\nup from nowhere to become the<br />\nbest goalie on the East Coast<br />\nin NCAA Division II.<br />\nDespite an overall record of<br />\n7 and 6, the team won when it<br />\nhad to, and took second at the<br />\nMid-Atlantic Water Polo Conferbehind<br />\nence Championship<br />\nMonmouth College of New<br />\nJersey. By virtue of their second<br />\nplace finish, Hopkins gained<br />\nentrance into the NCAA Division II East Coast championship<br />\nwhere it went 2 and 1 to take<br />\nthird place.<br />\nThe 1978 season was also<br />\nthe last one for Smiddy, Sick,<br />\nChinn, Wolfram and several<br />\nothers, leaving this year's water<br />\npolo team in much the same<br />\nposition as 1978's at the beginning of last season. Co-captains<br />\nSteve Long and Brain Kutsunai<br />\nwill be leading a very young<br />\nteam into the 1979 season.<br /><br />\nLong, Kutsunai and McCloskey<br />\nare the only seniors on this<br />\nyear's team, which includes six<br />\nfreshmen. Because water polo<br />\ninvolves shuffling swimmers in<br />\nand out of the match,coach Bob<br />\nSummers expects to use many of<br />\nhis younger players. In particular, he is expecting major contributions from sophomore Jeff<br />\nSalmore and freshmen Jeff<br />\nMilnes and Tom Newburger,<br />\nboth of whom have played water<br />\npolo before in high school.<br />\nToday's pre-season tournament being held at the White<br />\nAthletic Center (schedule below)<br />\nwill include strong teams from<br />\nWashington &amp; Lee and Navy, in<br />\naddition to Hopkins. Although<br />\nthe Hopkins team will be out<br />\nthere to win, their matches this<br />\nweekend will also be an important tune-up for what will follow<br />\nin October. Many freshmen<br />\nwill be in their first water polo<br />\nmatch ever; so the exposure to<br />\ncollegiate competition and the<br />\nexperience that will be gained by<br />\nplaying with their teammates as<br />\na unit will prove to be invaluable.<br />\nThis year's team, though<br />\nsimilar to last year's in many<br />\nways, is unique in that its<br />\nsuccess will depend on the<br />\nyounger players on the squad,<br />\nmany of whom will be in a<br />\nposition to make an immediate<br />\ncontribution. This year's starting team may very well have two<br />\nstarting freshmen. Though injuries will be important, the<br />\ntelling factors for the 1979<br />\nwater polo team will be leadership of the captains, and the<br />\npoise and character of the team<br />\nto meet the challenges of the<br />\n1979 season and keep the<br />\nmomentum going.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br /><br />\n\"c\u2022<br /><br />\nSophomore ';wimmer Jeff Salmore takes careful aim.<br /><br />\nHarriers Shine<br /><br />\nWomen Dominate MAC<br /><br />\nfor 3 years in his capacity as<br />\nhead track coach at Hopkins.<br />\nWhen Women's Cross Coun- He is also Women's Fencing<br />\ntry Coach Gary Green approach- coach, a position he has held for<br />\ned Bob Scott before last season 5 years.

Her time at Essex was<br />\n19:14 for 3 miles. Her winning<br />\ntime in the Metro Tourney was a<br />\nquick 18:43. These performances led Coach Green to<br />\nspeculate that \"Terry has an<br />\noutside chance of going undefeated all year.\"<br />\nBuescher's presence on the<br />\nteam is a story in itself.
