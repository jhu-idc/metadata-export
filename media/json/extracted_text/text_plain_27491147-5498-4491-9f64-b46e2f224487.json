Whereas, the scarcity of readable news has, on a number of<br />\noccasions, forced a wide use of this sort of material, custom is primarily responsible for the misuse of so much space.<br />\nIt was pointed out in a local daily, several months ago, that<br />\ncustom had forced the press to reserve a regular amount of space<br />\nfor the free advertising of the motor industry, the stage, etc.<br />\nSome of the bolder leaders of the above-mentioned movement<br />\nhave broken free from the yoke and have declared themselves as<br />\nagainst widespread free-advertising for other than amateur affairs.<br />\nInasmuch as the publishers are directly dependent upon their<br />\npaid advertisers, it is, of course, impossible to ward off entirely the<br />\nattack hurled by the publicity agents of the various promoters.<br />\nIt does seem, though, rather an unbalanced sort of publicity<br />\nthat devotes from one to three pages in a single edition to the promotion of monied sports. Its only possible excuse is that \"it advertises<br />\nthe city.\"<br />\nWe rather agree with the revolutionary editors who have cast<br />\noff the shackles, that the reading public would require but a single<br />\nseason to be educated into being enthusiastic followers of amateur<br />\nsport, either of the sand-lot or collegiate variety.<br />\nIn pushing non-professional sports, the press would not only<br />\nsucceed just as well in advertising the city, hut would give a great<br />\nboost to a system that is serving, in a large measure, to make America's manhood physically better off.<br />\nA single column per issue should be a sufficient news item on any<br />\nprofessional sport. The press has the power of turning the \"fan's\"<br />\ndollar into a hopper providing the already overpaid professional with<br />\nmore cash or of turning it into a machine designed to produce strong,<br />\nclean American citizens.<br />\nWhile there's life, there's hope, so there's a bare chance that<br />\neven the press may learn a thing or two in time.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSUPPORT THE SPRING SCHEDULE<br />\nSaturday marks the opening of a spring sport schedule which<br />\npromises to be the best in years. Much depends upon solid student<br />\nsupport, if this schedule is to be a success. Last fall the enthusiasm<br />\nof the undergraduate body helped carry a good football team to the<br />\nstate gridiron championship. That same spirit of hearty support<br />\nand co-operation can overcome any difficulties which may appear this<br />\nspring. This loyal strain is not a thing new at Hopkins, but has<br />\nlately become active in manifold ways. Every class and each individual will prove equal to the occasion. The spring schedule will<br />\nbe a success.<br />\n<br />\nThe Season Ticket Sale Runs<br />\nto April 1st.<br />\nJUST FOUR MORE DAYS TO SELL YOUR NINE<br />\n<br />\nEverybody Hustle\u2014Make it a Hot Finish<br />\n<br />\nce:oxe:inececocexecoxo:8:6:6:6:extoo<br />\n(Eke Ortextizorisr<br />\nHi<br />\n<br />\nplace went to the University of<br />\nMaryland, with the following colelges scoring in the mentioned order:<br />\nDrexel Institute, third; Penn<br />\nState, second team, fourth; Gettysburg, fifth; U. of H.

In this match<br />\nHopkins made 3294 out of a possible 4,000.<br />\nThe low standard of shooting<br />\non the part of the Black and Blue<br />\nsharpshooters is due to the fact<br />\nthat the men were required to use<br />\nthe regulation rifles issued by the<br />\ngovernment. These were so badly<br />\nworn that accurate shooting was<br />\nimpossible. The R. 0. T. C. office<br />\nreported the matter to the government and the rifles, after being inspected, were condemned.<br />\nWithin a short while new rifles<br />\nwill be shipped. If our team had<br />\nhad the new rifles during the<br />\nmatch, the Military Department<br />\nis confident that the final score<br />\nwould have been much higher.<br />\nIn a dual match with the University of Maryland, which came<br />\nout second in the Corps Area<br />\nmatch the Hopkins team, using<br />\nthe new range rifles, won by a<br />\nmargin of forty points. In a match<br />\nwith Gettysburg, Hopkins snowed<br />\ntheir opponents under. The Black<br />\nand Blue has also defeated a number of other teams in dual matches<br />\nthat outranked us in the Corps<br />\nArea match.<br />\nThe final score of the sixth<br />\nstage of the Intercollegiate Rifle<br />\nAssociation match has been announced.

With the already proven material left from<br />\nthe indoor season shaping up, and<br />\nwith many new and promising<br />\ncandidates out for all positions,<br />\nthe team is eagerly looking forward to what it is hoped will turn<br />\nout to be the best and most successful track season ever undertaken.<br />\n<br />\nof creating more competition in the<br />\nvarious classes, varsity men will<br />\ncompete among themselves and<br />\nnon-varsity men will be put in a<br />\nseparate class. This arrangement<br />\nwill do away with the idea that it<br />\nis useless for a non-varsity man to<br />\nenter any event because a \"sure bet\"<br />\nhas been entered. In order to balance the scores, varsity men will<br />\nbe awarded 3, 2 and 1 points for<br />\nfirst, second and third places, respectively, and non-varsity men<br />\nwill be awarded 5, 3 and 1 points.<br />\nAll points will be summed up for<br />\nthe various classes and the winning<br />\nclass will be awarded a banner.<br />\nAll class presidents will appoint<br />\nmen to take charge of the various<br />\nclass teams, organize them and get<br />\nthe members into first-class condition.<br />\nEnthusiasm should run high as<br />\nrivalry between the classes is very<br />\nkeen.

Previous to this<br />\ntime, an attempt had been made to<br />\narrange a game between the two<br />\nuniversities earlier in the season,<br />\nbut the managers could not come<br />\nto terms so everything was called<br />\noff.<br />\nThe present negotiations came as<br />\na result of a letter from Brown, asking for a game with Hopkins at<br />\nProvidence on June 21. This is<br />\nthe Commencement Day game for<br />\nBrown and is probably the biggest<br />\none of the season. The Hopkins<br />\nteam will very likely make the trip,<br />\nalthough the University closes on<br />\nthe twentieth.

Whereas, the scarcity of readable news has, on a number of<br />\noccasions, forced a wide use of this sort of material, custom is primarily responsible for the misuse of so much space.<br />\nIt was pointed out in a local daily, several months ago, that<br />\ncustom had forced the press to reserve a regular amount of space<br />\nfor the free advertising of the motor industry, the stage, etc.<br />\nSome of the bolder leaders of the above-mentioned movement<br />\nhave broken free from the yoke and have declared themselves as<br />\nagainst widespread free-advertising for other than amateur affairs.<br />\nInasmuch as the publishers are directly dependent upon their<br />\npaid advertisers, it is, of course, impossible to ward off entirely the<br />\nattack hurled by the publicity agents of the various promoters.<br />\nIt does seem, though, rather an unbalanced sort of publicity<br />\nthat devotes from one to three pages in a single edition to the promotion of monied sports. Its only possible excuse is that \"it advertises<br />\nthe city.\"<br />\nWe rather agree with the revolutionary editors who have cast<br />\noff the shackles, that the reading public would require but a single<br />\nseason to be educated into being enthusiastic followers of amateur<br />\nsport, either of the sand-lot or collegiate variety.<br />\nIn pushing non-professional sports, the press would not only<br />\nsucceed just as well in advertising the city, hut would give a great<br />\nboost to a system that is serving, in a large measure, to make America's manhood physically better off.<br />\nA single column per issue should be a sufficient news item on any<br />\nprofessional sport. The press has the power of turning the \"fan's\"<br />\ndollar into a hopper providing the already overpaid professional with<br />\nmore cash or of turning it into a machine designed to produce strong,<br />\nclean American citizens.<br />\nWhile there's life, there's hope, so there's a bare chance that<br />\neven the press may learn a thing or two in time.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSUPPORT THE SPRING SCHEDULE<br />\nSaturday marks the opening of a spring sport schedule which<br />\npromises to be the best in years. Much depends upon solid student<br />\nsupport, if this schedule is to be a success. Last fall the enthusiasm<br />\nof the undergraduate body helped carry a good football team to the<br />\nstate gridiron championship. That same spirit of hearty support<br />\nand co-operation can overcome any difficulties which may appear this<br />\nspring. This loyal strain is not a thing new at Hopkins, but has<br />\nlately become active in manifold ways. Every class and each individual will prove equal to the occasion. The spring schedule will<br />\nbe a success.<br /><br />\nThe Season Ticket Sale Runs<br />\nto April 1st.<br />\nJUST FOUR MORE DAYS TO SELL YOUR NINE<br /><br />\nEverybody Hustle\u2014Make it a Hot Finish<br /><br />\nce:oxe:inececocexecoxo:8:6:6:6:extoo<br />\n(Eke Ortextizorisr<br />\nHi<br /><br />\nplace went to the University of<br />\nMaryland, with the following colelges scoring in the mentioned order:<br />\nDrexel Institute, third; Penn<br />\nState, second team, fourth; Gettysburg, fifth; U. of H.

In this match<br />\nHopkins made 3294 out of a possible 4,000.<br />\nThe low standard of shooting<br />\non the part of the Black and Blue<br />\nsharpshooters is due to the fact<br />\nthat the men were required to use<br />\nthe regulation rifles issued by the<br />\ngovernment. These were so badly<br />\nworn that accurate shooting was<br />\nimpossible. The R. 0. T.

If our team had<br />\nhad the new rifles during the<br />\nmatch, the Military Department<br />\nis confident that the final score<br />\nwould have been much higher.<br />\nIn a dual match with the University of Maryland, which came<br />\nout second in the Corps Area<br />\nmatch the Hopkins team, using<br />\nthe new range rifles, won by a<br />\nmargin of forty points. In a match<br />\nwith Gettysburg, Hopkins snowed<br />\ntheir opponents under. The Black<br />\nand Blue has also defeated a number of other teams in dual matches<br />\nthat outranked us in the Corps<br />\nArea match.<br />\nThe final score of the sixth<br />\nstage of the Intercollegiate Rifle<br />\nAssociation match has been announced.

In order to balance the scores, varsity men will<br />\nbe awarded 3, 2 and 1 points for<br />\nfirst, second and third places, respectively, and non-varsity men<br />\nwill be awarded 5, 3 and 1 points.<br />\nAll points will be summed up for<br />\nthe various classes and the winning<br />\nclass will be awarded a banner.<br />\nAll class presidents will appoint<br />\nmen to take charge of the various<br />\nclass teams, organize them and get<br />\nthe members into first-class condition.<br />\nEnthusiasm should run high as<br />\nrivalry between the classes is very<br />\nkeen.

Previous to this<br />\ntime, an attempt had been made to<br />\narrange a game between the two<br />\nuniversities earlier in the season,<br />\nbut the managers could not come<br />\nto terms so everything was called<br />\noff.<br />\nThe present negotiations came as<br />\na result of a letter from Brown, asking for a game with Hopkins at<br />\nProvidence on June 21. This is<br />\nthe Commencement Day game for<br />\nBrown and is probably the biggest<br />\none of the season. The Hopkins<br />\nteam will very likely make the trip,<br />\nalthough the University closes on<br />\nthe twentieth.

They<br />\nwere reluctant to leave, however.<br />\nThey were deeply interested in<br />\ntheir work, and nothing less than<br />\ndynamite could, have shattered<br />\ntheir heroic resolution to wait. At<br />\nthis critical moment, however,<br />\nsomeone produced a copy of the<br />\nNews-Letter.
