People are not machines who can be<br />\nturned on at any moment of the day or night according to<br />\nthe dictates of efficiency. Certainly, under the law the<br />\nUniversity is entitled to set whatever hours it likes for its<br />\nx,irorkers: So is the American Nazi Party legally able to<br />\nmarch in Jewish neighborhoods. Both actions are barbarous.<br />\nIt. is probably true that the head of Housekeeping has<br />\nheard few actual complaints about the change. The problem<br />\nmight be taken for the result of an innocent mistake on the<br />\npart of Mr. Zanello and company, except for the<br />\nGestapo-like: tactics that have been used to stifle all protest.<br />\nAn aura of fear pervades the custodial staff. The<br />\nNews-Letter reporter who wrote an article on the situation<br />\nwas not permitted to speak with the employees except in<br />\nthe presence of a supervisor. A flood of letters and calls hit<br />\nthe News-Letter the next day from the new night janitors<br />\nexpressing the desperate unhappiness they had feared to<br />\nreveal in the presence of superiors.<br />\nThe primary argument used to justify the new system is<br />\nthat it makes it easier to clean buildings when people are<br />\nnot using them. Some such advantage is thereby gained, to<br />\nbe sure. But morale is a terribly important facto\"r in the<br />\nperformance of any organization. Almost any worker<br />\naccomplishes a good deal more in eight hours if he is happy<br />\nthan if he is unhappy. Reason as well . as decency dictates<br />\nthat Mr. Zanello should clean up the mess he has caused by<br />\nreturning his staff to its former hours.<br />\n<br />\nFraternity Row<br />\nSeveral Hopkins fraternities find themselves in hot water<br />\n<br />\nwith their community this year. The trouble is largely of<br />\ntheir own making; people in their late teens and early<br />\ntwenties can be difficult to live with at times. The recent<br />\ndiscussions between several frats and their neighbors have<br />\nbeen productive and beneficial for both parties.<br />\nBut the criticisms leveled by some in this matter are all<br />\ntoo typical of the continual carping by many area residents<br />\nabout the University and its students. The truth is,<br />\nfraternities are among the few groups which display vigor<br />\nand youth in an otherwise rather dull, unexciting part of<br />\nthe city.<br />\nAnd it is not only because many residents in the area are<br />\nold that the community has such a superannuated social<br />\n<br />\nscene.

With the help of<br />\nsome friends, however, I came to<br />\nmy senses, realizing that the<br />\n<br />\narticle wasn't worth responding<br />\nto; such things are better left<br />\nalone. The crossfire between<br />\npre-meds and non-pre-meds<br />\nwhich has appeared in the Letters<br />\nto the Editor since that article--a<br />\ncross-fire which has most recently<br />\ndeteriorated into a pointless<br />\ndisplay of profanity and vicious<br />\npersonal insult--proves the latter<br />\npoint admirably.<br />\nWhy is it that we feel a need to<br />\nattack each other because of our<br />\nchosen field of study and our<br />\nprofessed aspirations?

Or is it that<br />\nthe authoritarianism of this<br />\ninstitution has so convinced us of<br />\nour inferiority that we see\u2014and<br />\ntreat--each other as inferiors?<br />\nThere is a pressing need for<br />\neach of us at Johns Hopkins<br />\n(students, faculty and<br />\nadministration members) to<br />\nperform a serious<br />\nself-examination; to find out<br />\nwhat it is in our own personal<br />\nbehaviors that has led to the<br />\nanti -social, uncooperative,<br />\ndisrespectful, and unappreciative<br />\natmosphere of this University.<br />\nOnly then can we discover what<br />\nneeds to be dote, and what must<br />\nbe done to make our lives here<br />\nmore pleasant and rewarding.<br />\nRealistically, there isn't much<br />\nhope for us.

It<br />\nwas Flag Day, and so the theme<br />\nwas \"Flag and Country.\" The<br />\nhost of the show asked me how I<br />\nfelt about my ancestors' doings<br />\nat Fort McHenry in the year<br />\n1814. I said I was thoroughly<br />\nashamed, that the British had<br />\nindeed behaved abominably. I<br />\nthen made the mistake of adding<br />\nthat every American should, by<br />\nthe same token, be thoroughly<br />\nashamed of what this country<br />\nwas then up to in Vietnam.<br />\nThe response was electric. The<br />\nswitchboard lit up and the man<br />\nin the booth monitoring the<br />\nphone calls became quite<br />\nagitated. I was variously advised<br />\nthat I had no rights as a foreigner<br />\nto say anything (although I did<br />\ncarry a draft card in my pocket),<br />\nthat I should go back where I<br />\nbelonged (which to the<br />\nmild-mannered meant Britain but<br />\nto the more acerbic souls meant<br />\nSiberia or the fiery inferno), and<br />\nthat I was a good reason why no<br />\none should ever send his son to<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nI found all, this perplexing. I<br />\nhad been raised in that liberal<br />\nintellectual tradition in which<br />\nreasoned consistency is highly<br />\nvalued. And while I may have<br />\nbeen guilty of making a false<br />\nanalogy, I found it difficult to<br />\nexplain how Americans could<br />\ncelebrate the principles of their<br />\nown revolution with such pride<br />\nwhile they were doing their level<br />\nbest to squash every national<br />\nliberation movement in sight.<br />\nAfter that experience with<br />\nAmerican public opinion, I<br />\nretired to lick my wounds,<br />\nprotect my prospects of<br />\nacademic tenure, and collect my<br />\nthoughts. I fell to ruminating<br />\nupon the innumberable<br />\ncontradictions that pervaded<br />\nAmerican thought and practice.<br />\nI noted, for example, the<br />\nconstant stream of criticism of<br />\nthe Soviet Union for hiding<br />\nbehind the Iron Curtain and not<br />\nallowing the free flow of people<br />\nand ideas across its borders. Yet<br />\nthe U.S. State Department, until<br />\nrecently, systematically denied<br />\neven visitors' visas to anyone who<br />\nbelonged to any of the influential<br />\nCommunist parties of Western<br />\nEurope.<br />\nThen there was the infamous<br />\npromise to keep Vietnam free<br />\neven if it meant killing all the<br />\nVietnamese to do it, and an<br />\nAmerican commitment to defend<br />\nand prserve a \"free\" world which<br />\nincluded such paragons of virtue<br />\nas Generalissimo Franco in Spain,<br />\nthe generals in Brazil, Somoza in<br />\nNicaragua, the Shah of Iran, to<br />\nsay nothing of the<br />\nextraordinarily repressive regimes<br />\nin Indonesia and South Africa.<br />\nThat contradiction seemed<br />\neven more bizarre as the United<br />\nStates approached its own<br />\nBicentennial, and it is no wonder<br />\nthat Jimmy Carter had to stump<br />\nthe world preaching human rights<br />\nin order to revive American<br />\n<br />\ncredibility in a world grown<br />\nextremely cynical of American<br />\nintentions.<br />\nAt home, the \"Great Society\"<br />\nfell apart as it became apparent<br />\nthat social programs were least<br />\neffective where they were most<br />\nneeded and most effective where<br />\nthey were least needed. I<br />\ndiscovered that the preamble to<br />\nevery piece of Congressional<br />\nhousing legislation since 1945<br />\nasserts that every American has a<br />\nright to a decent home in a<br />\nsuitable living environment, and<br />\nwas surprised when I took a walk<br />\naround Baltimore to see the<br />\nresult. While preaching human<br />\nrights to the Russians, Jimmy<br />\nCarter appears little disposed to<br />\ndo anything about the right to<br />\ndecent housing, and seems mildly<br />\nsurprised when the blacks and<br />\nurban poor become cynical too.<br />\nAmerica, I decided, was a land<br />\nof Catch-22 , a country - to use a<br />\ncliche American journalists<br />\nfrequently apply to countries<br />\nother than their own - full of<br />\nparadoxes and contradictions.<br />\nShortly after my talk-show<br />\nexperience, I happened to read<br />\nKarl Marx. He placed great<br />\nemphasis on the \"contradictions<br />\nof capitalism,\" and that caught<br />\nmy attention. I read on,<br />\nintrigued. And the more I read,<br />\nthe more it seemed to make<br />\nsense. At the bottom of it all,<br />\nMarx argued, lies a tension<br />\nbetween capital and labor,<br />\nbetween profits and wages, which<br />\nproduces all manner of<br />\ncontradictions in the realms of<br />\neconomics, politics, social<br />\nstructures, institutions, and even<br />\nwithin thought itself.<br />\nWe could, Marx suggested,<br />\ncreate a theory to explain the<br />\ncontradictions - and the theory<br />\nwould help us to overcome them.<br />\nfound this exciting and started<br />\nto work at it-- and one by one<br />\nthe contradictions that had so<br />\nperplexed me crumbled before<br />\nthe power of the analysis.<br />\nWhen The Times of London<br />\nopined that political democracy<br />\nwas a luxury we could afford<br />\nonly if the trade unions and the<br />\nworkers showed restraint with<br />\nrespect to wage demands, I could<br />\nreadily see why they would say<br />\nthat. And it became equally easy<br />\nto understand the irate trade<br />\nunionist who wrote to The Times<br />\nto .say that political democracy<br />\nwas worthless if the price was<br />\nthat he voluntarily live in poverty<br />\nin order to keep his boss reveling<br />\nin luxury. Marx called this kind<br />\nof thing class struggle. Armed<br />\nwith that concept, I found I<br />\ncould go a long way.<br />\nBut the more successful I<br />\nbecame in unraveling the<br />\ncontradictions, the more I was<br />\nforced to accept the social<br />\nconsequences. By the time I<br />\nquoted Marx more than twice<br />\n(and not for purposes of poking<br />\nfun at him), many of my<br />\nacademic colleagues began to<br />\nregard me with suspicion. When I<br />\nsaid that perhaps Marx had<br />\nsomething sensible to contribute<br />\nto our understanding of society,<br />\nthe reaction was both outraged<br />\nand outrageous. Stories came<br />\nback to me that I had taken leave<br />\nof my senses and thrown in my<br />\nlot with what one of my most<br />\neminent colleagues described in a<br />\n<br />\nlearned journal as \"kooks, freaks,<br />\ndrop-outs, and malcontents.\"<br />\nI found this disconcerting<br />\nbecause I had never felt saner in<br />\nmy life. And I found it<br />\ndiscouraging because I felt I had<br />\nhold of an analysis that made<br />\nsense. What I began to discover<br />\nthrough experience was the<br />\nmeaning of \"repressive<br />\ntolerance.\" Freedom of thought<br />\nin the university is typically<br />\nconfined to certain boundaries.<br />\nWithin those boundaries you can<br />\nsay and do whatever you like;<br />\ntolerance rules there.

They say, in effect,\"<br />\nWe defend to our deaths the<br />\nprinciple of freedom of<br />\nintellectual inquiry provided you<br />\ndefend to your death our right to<br />\nfire you for engaging in it.\"<br />\nI first discovered that principle<br />\nwhen I happened to sit in on a<br />\nseminar given by an eminent<br />\nprofessor of sociology who gave<br />\nan account of Marx's thought<br />\nthat bore absolutely no relation<br />\nto the Marx I had studied.

This appointment,<br />\nhe said, \"is as ridiculous as .it<br />\nwould be to appoint Henry Ford<br />\nto head the political department<br />\nat Moscow Univesity.\" In my<br />\nliberal days I would have found<br />\nthat remark deeply perplexing<br />\nbecause I always thought the<br />\nUnited States was supposed to be<br />\n<br />\ndifferent from the Soviet Union that there was repression there<br />\nand freedom of expression here.<br />\nBut I now see that Senator<br />\nBishop was just trying to tell it<br />\nlike it really is.<br />\nOf course, things have changed<br />\nsince the bad old days of<br />\nMcCarthyism. The cruder forms_<br />\nof repression don't make sense<br />\nany more.The contradictions are<br />\ntoo obvious.<br />\nFor example, I came across the<br />\nreport of a Commission on<br />\nSubversive Activities to the<br />\nMaryland General Assembly. It<br />\nwas dated 1949 - the year the<br />\nCIA was formed - and it made<br />\ninteresting .reading. Communists<br />\nwere to be denied their political<br />\nrights because communism was a<br />\ntreasonable conspiracy, not a<br />\npolitical movement. Communists<br />\nuse fifth -column techniques.<br />\nThey operate under the direction<br />\nof a foreign power. They,<br />\ninfiltrate the labor unions,<br />\neducational organizations, and<br />\nthe media, from which positions<br />\nthey foster strikes, sabotage,<br />\npolitical murders, and racial and<br />\n\u2022 economic chaos. They infiltrate<br />\nthe armed forces, and when the<br />\nchaos is at its worst, they<br />\nforcibly overthrow the<br />\n- government, liquidate the<br />\nopposition, and abolish Political<br />\nparties. Finally, they legitimize<br />\ntheir conquest by a so-called free<br />\nelection or referendum which<br />\npurports to demonstrate popular<br />\nsupport.<br />\nNow, that sounds pretty<br />\nunpleasant to me, and I must say<br />\nI could do without it if that is<br />\n. what communism is all about. So<br />\nlet's agree that this kind of<br />\n!activity is a \"treasonable<br />\nIconspiracy\" against democracy<br />\nand that people who engage in it<br />\nshould be deprived of their<br />\npolitical rights. The trouble is<br />\nthat this was exactly what the<br />\nCIA was up to in Chile, with the<br />\napproval of Henry A. Kissinger<br />\nand Richard M. Nixon.<br />\nIn my iliberal days I would<br />\nhave expressed mild surprise that<br />\nHenry Kissinger was still at large.<br />\nBut I am older and wiser now.

His near-victory<br />\nin the 1968 New Hampshire<br />\nDemocratic Presidential primary<br />\nwas instrumental in the decision<br />\nof President Lyndon B. Johnson<br />\nnot to seek reelection. In 1976,<br />\nhe ran as an independent in the<br />\ngeneral election. Until 1970, he<br />\nserved as a U.S. Senator from<br />\nMinnesota. Before his speech on<br />\nthe Sixties at the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium on<br />\nNovember 1st, he spoke to the<br />\nNews-Letter about the Seventies.<br />\nN-L; Do you think that<br />\nAmerica has turned inward<br />\nduring the Seventies?<br />\nMcCirthy: I don't know what<br />\nthey mean by turning inward. As<br />\nfar as foreign policy is concerned<br />\nand turning away from other<br />\ncountries, we've practically<br />\nrejected all of our allies beginning<br />\nin the Fifties under then<br />\nSecretary of State John Foster<br />\nDulles and progressively since<br />\nthen. We've proceeded as if we<br />\ndidn't need any allies, as if it<br />\nwere just sort of a gesture. And<br />\nit's more evident now than at the<br />\nbeginning of the Fifties under<br />\nDulles, when we had this whole<br />\ndeclaration of moral superiority<br />\nfor the United States--'We're glad<br />\nto have you coming along with us<br />\nif you want to, but if you don't<br />\nwe 'lido it our way anyway.'<br />\nN-L: Well, there are some<br />\nserious problems going on<br />\noverseas, for example in South<br />\nAfrica, Iran, and the increasing<br />\nSoviet involvement, yet people at<br />\nhome don't seem to be very<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nMcCarthy: I don't know how<br />\ndeep the Soviet involvement is or<br />\nhow significant it is. We went<br />\nthrough this in the Fifties, when<br />\nthey were supposed to be gaining<br />\ngreat strength in North Africa.<br />\nDulles had a plan to try to<br />\n.establish a sort of agreement to<br />\ncontain the Communists in<br />\nNorthern Africa. Egypt was his<br />\nbig worry then. If we had this<br />\nring around Egypt, we could<br />\ncontrol Communism...I don't see<br />\nthe Russians as having any great<br />\nimpact in the long run in Africa.<br />\nThey may start a revolutionary<br />\ngovernment somewhere, but then<br />\nwhen they're done, what do they<br />\ndo with it? I think our response<br />\nshould be limited and restrained.<br />\nWe don't know much about it, in<br />\nthe first place. I think we know<br />\nas much about it as we thought<br />\nWe did about Vietnam. We didn't<br />\nknow anything about Vietnam.<br />\nN-L: One of the big issues on<br />\ncampus is divestment, but the<br />\ndemonstrations don't seem to be<br />\nall that large, not at all<br />\ncomparable to the Vietnam<br />\nprotests. Do you think we should<br />\ndivest?<br />\nMcCarthy: It's not a criticisin of<br />\nthem, but I don't think that many<br />\nstudents are really interested in<br />\nSouth Africa. But even if you<br />\nare, it's very difficult to sort it<br />\nout, to know what's the right<br />\nthing to do...We really don't<br />\nknow too much about the<br />\nrevolutionary forces...it's like<br />\nthat in Pakistan .or Iran. Three or<br />\nfour months ago, they<br />\ndemonstrated against the Shah.<br />\n<br />\nNow they're saying demonstrate<br />\npractically for the Shah because<br />\nhe's being attacked by the<br />\nreactionary Moslem sects. We<br />\nwent through these things after<br />\nWorld War II. We used to talk<br />\nabout Third Forces in<br />\nYugoslavia, for example...in<br />\nGreece,...and in Iran, which<br />\nweren't really there. Another<br />\nexample of not knowing what<br />\nwe're talking about is supporting<br />\nthe military junta in Greece. We<br />\n<br />\neven supported the more extreme<br />\none when it came in and it was so<br />\nextreme that the Greeks threw it<br />\nout. But the American policy was<br />\nto support the junta. Everyone<br />\nassumed 'You got to do this or<br />\nCommunism will take over in<br />\nGreece'...These were areas in<br />\nwhich you'd expect them to<br />\nknow more.<br />\nN-L: Has the nature of the<br />\nissues changed at all since<br />\n1 968?<br />\nMcCarthy: In the<br />\nSixties, one of the big issues was<br />\nstudent rights on campus. For<br />\nthe most part, that's taken care<br />\n<br />\n'We'ye practically<br />\nrejected all our<br />\nallies from the<br />\n`50's, and since<br />\nthen.......\"<br />\nof. There are still a few campuses<br />\nwhere students have protested<br />\nwith some cause, across the<br />\ncountry...these points of protest<br />\nhave been pretty well responded<br />\nto. The war in Vietnam has<br />\nended. We now have a volunteer<br />\narmy, which was not a very good<br />\nway to take the pressure off, but<br />\nthe pre\u00a7sure point would<br />\nprobably still exist had the draft<br />\ncontinued...So you don't have<br />\nany cause on campus saying,<br />\n'Well, I'm not going to be<br />\ndrafted.'<br />\nN-L: What's wrong with the all<br />\nvolunteer army?<br />\nMcCarthy: It's really a<br />\nmercenary army in the first<br />\nplace. Secondly,it's an<br />\nunrepresentative army. Thirdly,<br />\nit runs contrary to the best<br />\ntheory about the army in a<br />\n<br />\ndemocracy, which is that it ought<br />\nto be one that's representative of<br />\nthe people instead of one<br />\nrepresenting just minorities, and<br />\nthe poor, which is what this army<br />\nnow does...The injustice of our<br />\ncampuses has been taken care of.<br />\nNow the problem is the sort of<br />\nreverse thing. The Bakke case is a<br />\ncontrast to what the issue was in<br />\nthe Sixties of discrimination<br />\nagainst minorities...<br />\nN-L: Why is there this new<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Is there a new<br />\nconservatism in issues other than<br />\ntaxation?<br />\nMcCarthy: I don't know where<br />\nthey want to run the other issues.<br />\nJust to say you're going to put a<br />\nlimit on unemployment<br />\ncompensation doesn't mean that<br />\nyou've become conservative. It<br />\nmeans that the liberal position<br />\nhas been vindicated...It may also<br />\nmean simply that the liberals<br />\nhaven't been sensible or simply<br />\n<br />\nconservatism, with Proposition<br />\nhave realized that theie are<br />\n13 in California and Jeff Bell<br />\nproper limitations on all these<br />\nousting Clifford Case in New<br />\nprograms...<br />\nN-L: The Republicans are now<br />\nJersey?<br />\naccusing the Democrats of using<br />\nMcCarthy: Each of these are<br />\nRepublican principles.<br />\nparticular cases.

Something<br />\nhave to pursue things that were<br />\nlike it, not Proposition 13, but<br />\nworkable and reasonable 30 years<br />\nopposition to what appears to be<br />\nago...The Republicans did that<br />\narbittary taxation on homes and<br />\nfor 50 years and that's what<br />\nreal estate.

One, it's<br />\npretty arbitrary for a person to<br />\nhave the assessed value of his<br />\nhome go up and his taxes<br />\nincreased on it...without any sort<br />\nof representation. It sort of<br />\nsupposedly happens that because<br />\nthe property goes up, so your<br />\ntaxes go up. And set against that,<br />\nthey may be forced to sell their<br />\nhouse.And if they sell, whatever<br />\nthey gain from it, a third of it<br />\nmay be taken away in capital<br />\ndidn't...No one says Republicans<br />\ngains taxes, which would mean<br />\ncannot vote for Social Security<br />\nnow because they voted against it<br />\nthey'd have to buy a poorer<br />\nin 1936.<br />\nhouse by virtue of being forced<br />\nN-L: Then there aren't any<br />\nout of the house in which the<br />\nreal differences between the two<br />\nvalue had been increased.

Schmidt Jr.,<br />\nAssistant Professor of Psychiatry<br />\nat JHU School of Medicine and<br />\nChief of Psychiatry of Baltimore<br />\nCity hospitals gave a speech<br />\nentitled \"Adolescent Suicide in<br />\nAmerica Today.\"<br />\nSchmidt said suicide in<br />\nAmerica has always been stable,<br />\nvarying from 9-16 (successful)<br />\nsuicides per 100,000 people per<br />\nyear. Recently there have been<br />\nabout 25,000 reported suicides<br />\nper year in America. The real<br />\nfigure could be double this<br />\nbecause suicide is \"stigmatized\"<br />\nin America so many suicides are<br />\nreported as accidents. Among<br />\nadolescents aged 17 to 21 the<br />\nrate is low, about 3 or 4 suicides<br />\nper 100,000 per year, but this is<br />\n2.5 times the adolescent suicide<br />\nrate of 20 years ago. Suicide is<br />\nnow the fourth leading cause of<br />\ndeath among adolescents.<br />\n\"There is no one theory that<br />\nexplains suicide,\" Schmidt said,<br />\nbut he guesses that the increased<br />\n<br />\nadolescent rate is due to the<br />\nincreased use of alcohol and<br />\ndrugs among the young in the<br />\npast two decades. \"They alter<br />\none's level of consciousness, and<br />\nin an altered state of<br />\nconsciousness people will do<br />\nthings that they normally<br />\nwouldn't do.\" Drug use can make<br />\npeople emotionally unbalanced<br />\nand acts as a \"trigger mechanism<br />\nfor the suicide attempt.\"<br />\nSchmidt mentioned hoW some<br />\nsocial groups are more prone to<br />\nsuicide than others, but offered<br />\nfew explanations. Females<br />\nattempt suicide more often than<br />\nmales, but males succeed more<br />\noften (there are four times as<br />\nmany male as female successful<br />\nsuicides). Single and divorced<br />\npeople have higher suicide rates<br />\nthan married people. Whites have<br />\nhigher suicide rates than blacks.<br />\nHeavily Roman Catholic<br />\ncountries like Ireland and Spain<br />\nhave very low suicide rates(3 per<br />\n100,000) and Scandinavian<br />\ncountries have very high rates (18<br />\nto 25 per 100,000). Elderly,<br />\npeople have very high suicide '<br />\nrates because they \"lose friends<br />\nand their families and become<br />\nsocially isolated, and can't cope<br />\nwith life.\" Factors like<br />\nsocio-economic status or<br />\nunemployment are not highly<br />\ncorrelated with suicides,<br />\n<br />\nProductivity Not Improved<br />\nBy Night Shift Transfers<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nnight without the interference of<br />\nother people on campus is more<br />\nproductive, he said. No formal<br />\nstudy was<br />\nefficiency<br />\nimplemented, however, and while<br />\nsome employees acknowledged<br />\nthat it is easier to clean without<br />\nthe presence of students or<br />\nfaculty, others found the amount<br />\nof work they accomplished to be<br />\nthe same. \"I do eight hours of<br />\nwork, no difference if it's day or<br />\nnight\" one worker said. Another<br />\ns-uggested that the actual<br />\nproductivity has decreased since<br />\nthe. workers are now often only<br />\nhalf-awake.<br />\nSeveral custodians said another<br />\nmotive for the new policy was<br />\nthat the Plant Operations<br />\n<br />\nmany workers to quit,<br />\nthus facilitating a transition to<br />\nthe use of sub-contractors for all<br />\njanitorial work. This type of firm<br />\nwould be cheaper for the<br />\nUniversity and prevent any<br />\nlabor-relations problems.<br />\nThe shift was made without<br />\nconsulting the custodians, many<br />\nof whom have worked over 20<br />\nyears at Hopkins. They were<br />\ngiven a one-month, ten day<br />\nnotice.<br />\nZanella said he expected the<br />\ndecision to be unpopular. He had<br />\nexpected an attrition rate of tip<br />\nto 50%.

The feminine<br />\nmystique preached that<br />\nmotherhood and marriage should<br />\nbe totally fulfilling for every<br />\nwoman. Those women who were<br />\ndissatisfied felt guilty without<br />\nknowing the source of their guilt<br />\nand angry because they had no<br />\noutlet in society to achieve<br />\nself-fulfillment or even to discuss<br />\ntheir problems.<br />\nFor Friedan, the movement<br />\nfirst took the form of a demand<br />\nfor equality in employment,<br />\nparticularly that the government<br />\neffectively enforce the sex<br />\ndiscrimination clause of Title<br />\nVII. The rights women sought<br />\n\"were simply the bedrock of<br />\ndemocracy -American<br />\n-participation in the mainstream<br />\nof society. Human freedom.<br />\nSelf-determination.\"<br />\nShe further observed that in<br />\nthe latter part of the 60's, the<br />\nimage of the women's movement<br />\nwas distorted through the<br />\nmisguided actions of extremists<br />\nand the anger of all women. At<br />\nthis time the media represented<br />\n<br />\nthe movement as being directed<br />\nagainst men.<br />\nAccording to Friedan, it was<br />\nonly after women recognized the<br />\nreal enemy without that they<br />\ncould conquer the enemy within<br />\nthemselves. The enemy without<br />\nwas \"the right-wing, John Birch<br />\npolitical factions, the church<br />\nhierarchies, who tried to make<br />\nthe women's movement seem like<br />\na fad...\" The enemy from within<br />\nwas the anger of all women at<br />\ntheir own self-denigration, anger<br />\nat the fact that their<br />\nnewly-realized political power<br />\ncould not defeat sex<br />\ndiscrimination overnight. Women<br />\nfinally began to see that the<br />\nmovement must take the<br />\ndirection not of sex or class<br />\nwarfare, but of a sex-role<br />\nrevolution.<br />\nFriedan stated that once the<br />\nERA has been ratified and<br />\nimplemented through court<br />\ndecisions, the movement can<br />\nbegin dealing with the sex-role<br />\nrevolution. Because of unequal<br />\nsex roles, relationships between<br />\nmen and women have become<br />\ndistorted. Women should be able<br />\nto cultivate those human<br />\nqualities socially defined as<br />\n\"masculine,\" such as strength<br />\n-and the realistic ability to seek<br />\nfulfillment through a career.<br />\n<br />\nPresident George Connolly and<br />\nstudent members of the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies had advocated the<br />\nsingle-committee proposal. CUS<br />\nmember Jerry Spada cited the<br />\nbreadth of the review<br />\ncommittee's charge as a primary<br />\nincluding<br />\nfor<br />\nreason<br />\nundergraduates on the faculty<br />\ncommittee.<br />\n\"It (the committee charge)<br />\ncovers everything,\" he said.<br />\n\"That's why it's so vital that<br />\nstudents are on it. If students<br />\naren't<br />\nthen the faculty has<br />\neffectively bypassed CUS in its<br />\nfunction.\" Spada presented the<br />\nCUS resolution to the Academic<br />\nCouncil two weeks ago.<br />\nStudent Council President<br />\nGeorge Connolly said the<br />\nstudents working on the review<br />\nstudy group will be selected by<br />\nthe Council Committee on<br />\nCommittees. He said student<br />\ninput will also be sought in other<br />\nways.<br />\n<br />\n\"We will, through the<br />\nEducation Committee, be<br />\nworking on various projects<br />\ncogent to the review, and we will<br />\nbe submitting position papers<br />\nwith great regularity on virtually<br />\nevery issue that we can have an<br />\nopinion on.\"<br />\nHe also mentioned the<br />\npossibility of holding general<br />\nforums to discuss student<br />\nconcerns. \"Any problem where<br />\nthere's not a lot of technical<br />\nexpertise required, we will try to<br />\nhold a forum to discuss. We'll try<br />\nto hold them every two weeks or<br />\nevery three weeks to see how<br />\nthey go.

A member of the<br />\nPaulist Fathers, an American<br />\nRoman Catholic religous order<br />\ndedicated to explaining the<br />\nfundamental truths of the<br />\nCatholic Faith and to the<br />\nunderstanding and service of<br />\nnon- Catholics, Rev. Donahue<br />\nhas a varied and intensely<br />\ninteresting background.<br />\nIn June, 1942, he enlisted in<br />\nthe U.S. Army Tank Corps and<br />\nduring World War Two Father<br />\nDonahue participated in military<br />\ncampaigns in Northern France,<br />\nthe Rhineland, Ardennes, and<br />\ncentral Europe. He was wounded<br />\nin action three times and suffered<br />\nthe loss of his right eye in March<br />\nof 1945 in Marburg, Germany<br />\ndue to the shelling of enemy<br />\nbazooka fire. Subsequently, he<br />\nwas promoted to the rank of<br />\nFirst Lieutenant.<br />\nAfter having attended the<br />\nSchool of Foreign Service -of<br />\nGeorgetown University, Rev.<br />\nDonahue decided to enter the<br />\nPaulist minor seminary in<br />\nBaltimore. Eight years later, he<br />\nwas ordained a priest at the<br />\nChurch of St. Paul the Apostle in<br />\nNew York City.<br />\nFather Donahue's first Paulist<br />\nassignment was as Chaplain at<br />\nMemphis State University and<br />\nthe University of Tennessee<br />\nMedical School in Memphis. In<br />\nAugust of 1965 he travelled to<br />\nJohannesburg, South Africa,<br />\nwhere he initially served as<br />\nAssistant Pastor at the Church of<br />\nthe 'Blessed, Sacrament. He was<br />\nforced to leave the country after<br />\ntwo years when the government<br />\nrefused to renew his visa due to<br />\nthe Church's stand against<br />\napartheid. Before coming to<br />\nHopkins, Father Donahue was<br />\nthe Catholic Chaplain at Tufts<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nRecently, Father Donahue was<br />\nquestioned by the News-Letter<br />\non his new duties and<br />\nresponsibilities at Hopkins, his<br />\nperspective on how students and<br />\ntheir attitudes have changed in<br />\nthe last two decades, and his<br />\nviews on the Catholic Church and<br />\nits future with the ascension of<br />\nJohn Paul II to the papal throne.<br />\nHe was interviewed by Roger<br />\nBlumenthal.<br />\nWhat is your function on the<br />\nJohns Hopkins campus and your<br />\nrelationship to the Chaplain's<br />\noffice?<br />\nThere is no official connection<br />\nbut a good relationship exists.<br />\nSince 1927 we have had a<br />\ncooperative arrangement with the<br />\nuniversity which is the same for<br />\nall religious groups, except for<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain, which<br />\nis the established' coordinating<br />\noffice.<br />\nDo .you conduct Sunday mass<br />\nat Johns Hopkins?<br />\nYes, I am the campus pastor<br />\nfor the Catholic community at<br />\nHopkins. Mass will beheld at the<br />\nGlass Pavilion on Sundays at<br />\n10:00 A.M. Previously it was<br />\nheld at Shaffer Hall.<br />\nWe also celebrate mass on<br />\n<br />\ncampus Monday, Wednesday, and<br />\nFriday at 8:00 A.M. in the<br />\nconference room. During the<br />\nCatholic holy days mass will be<br />\nheld on campus just like a normal<br />\nCatholic parish. The one big<br />\nexception is midnight mass at<br />\nChristmas eve since no one is on<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nWhat other activities will you<br />\nsponsor for the Catholic students<br />\nand faculty?<br />\nPrayer groups and seminars<br />\nabout the Catholic faith will be<br />\norganized. On some occasions<br />\nspeakers will be invited to<br />\naddress the community.<br />\nI am also available for spiritual<br />\ncounseling on a twenty-four hour<br />\nbasis. The last statistics that we<br />\nhave show that 25% of the<br />\nstudent body at Johns Hopkins is<br />\nRoman Catholic.<br />\nHave the students been<br />\nparticipating actively in your<br />\nprograms?<br />\nAbout one hundered and<br />\nninety people usually attend<br />\nmass. This includes faculty, staff<br />\npeople and a nice group of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nI am also campus minister for<br />\nthe students at the medical<br />\nschool. Therefore, students from<br />\nthe downtoWn campus also<br />\nattend services. More Roman<br />\nCatholics have been participating<br />\nin worship services on campus<br />\nthan in the last ten years.<br />\nHow do you think students<br />\nhave changed in recent years in<br />\ngoals and moral values?<br />\nStudents are definitely more<br />\ncareer oriented. At a superior<br />\nacademic school like Johns<br />\nHopkins, they have become<br />\npre -professional students.<br />\nPractically everyone is preparing<br />\nfor a professional school.<br />\nespecially medicine and law. We<br />\nwish that more were entering the<br />\nfield of theology but there are<br />\nsome.<br />\nIt is fair to say that students<br />\nare digging deeper in their books<br />\nand spending more time studying<br />\nthan those of six years ago. Johns<br />\nHopkins' undergraduate campus<br />\nis just one big pressure cooker!<br />\nWe are beginning to wonder if<br />\nstudies are getting in the way of<br />\nan education. In a place like<br />\nOxford, students and professors<br />\ngather sometimes to discuss<br />\ngeneral topics without concern<br />\nfor grades.<br />\nHow do you account for this<br />\nchange in students?<br />\nThe pressures of grades to get<br />\ninto graduate school. Students<br />\nmust obtain high grades to get<br />\ninto graduate school in order to<br />\nenter their chosen profession.<br />\nBecause of this, general cultural<br />\ninterests must go by the wayside.<br />\nMany times students are not<br />\nexploring outside of their field in<br />\na voluntary nature. Less students<br />\nare participating in extra<br />\ncurricular activities than four<br />\nyears ago. Emphasis on studies at<br />\nJohns Hopkins is very intense.<br />\nThe one exception in the<br />\nCatholic community is mass<br />\nattendance which has been very<br />\ngood.<br />\nDo you think that Johns<br />\nHopkins is diffirent from other<br />\nuniversities that you have been<br />\nassociated with?<br />\nTufts where I served last is a<br />\nvery fine school but at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nthere are many more people In<br />\nthe hard sciences. It is probably<br />\nmore intense at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nOne does not find this intensity<br />\nin engineering schools nor in<br />\nsociology departments.<br />\nDo you think that this<br />\nintensity causes emotinoal<br />\nproblems?<br />\nIn counseling, I am asked<br />\nquestions like \"What can I do<br />\nwith my life? I may not make it to<br />\nmedical school. What do I do<br />\nnow?\" I try to show students that<br />\nthere are other things to do with<br />\none's life. I would love to see the<br />\nday when medical schools would<br />\nbe begging for students! A fine<br />\nstudent can regear himself to<br />\nlook another another avenue.<br />\nIt would be best if some<br />\nstudents did not come to a<br />\nschool like Hopkins. Straight A<br />\nstudents from high school are<br />\ncompeting against each other. If<br />\nthey had gone to a state school,<br />\nthey would have done very well<br />\nand probably been able to enter a<br />\n<br />\nanother assignment and get it<br />\nright away. I have been offered<br />\nmany other assignments before<br />\naccepting Hopkins.<br />\nWhat made you decide to<br />\ncome to Hopkins?<br />\nAfter six years at Tufts the<br />\nlikelihood that I should move is<br />\nrather strong. Assignments are<br />\nusually for a period of four years.<br />\nAmong the Paulist Fathers,<br />\nHopkins is considered a very<br />\ninteresting assignment. The<br />\nstudents respond to the ministry<br />\nand the priest.<br />\nI am also living closer to my<br />\nfamily for the first time. They<br />\nare in Philadelphia and Atlantic<br />\nCity. At my age one likes to see<br />\none's family more frequently.<br />\nHave you had any interesting<br />\nexperiences with Alie students<br />\nthat you would likes to share with<br />\nthe Hopkins community?<br />\nMy main efforts these past six<br />\nweeks have been to get around<br />\nand meet people. I had a fine<br />\ncourtesy call with President<br />\n<br />\nstate medical school.<br />\nHow do you compare your<br />\nposition at Hopkins with one at a<br />\nchurch in terms of your own<br />\npersonal satisfaction?<br />\nI like being around<br />\nuniversities. It offers a challenge<br />\nbecause of the \"get up and goof the students. I am one of the<br />\nlast in the priesthood of what we<br />\ncall \"general practioners.\" I have<br />\nto make an effort to relate to<br />\npeople in many academic fields.<br />\nWhen you are around young<br />\npeople, things are, usually very<br />\nhappy.<br />\n.<br />\nIn the university I am almost<br />\ntotally cut off from the problems<br />\nof married people. There are not<br />\nmany married students anymore.<br />\nI rarely officiate at a funeral in a<br />\nuniversity community where as<br />\nin a normal parish, I would be<br />\ncalled on to do it several times a<br />\nweek. I like to work at<br />\nuniversities, and I get up in the<br />\nmorning looking forward to the<br />\nday. At my level in the<br />\npriesthood, I could request<br />\n<br />\nMuller. I am a sailor and one of<br />\nthese days, I am going to get my<br />\nboat in the water and share some<br />\nexperiences with the students.<br />\nWhat is your reaction to a<br />\nselection of a non-Italian pope?<br />\nWere you surprised at all?<br />\nA very pleasant surprise. He is<br />\na former university chaplain!<br />\nDo you think that there will<br />\nbe any major changes in the<br />\nchurch?<br />\nIt is too early to say. I do not<br />\nsee much prospect of major<br />\nchange in church life. On the<br />\nworld scene it is a form of polite<br />\ncollaboration with. Communist<br />\ncountries.<br />\nIs the decline in the number of<br />\nmen entering the priesthood a<br />\nserious problem in your opinion?<br />\nIt is very serious. Though there<br />\nis a shortage, there are definitely<br />\nmore men entering our<br />\nseminaries. It is better now than<br />\na few years ago.<br />\nHave you noticed a change- in<br />\nthe moral standards of young<br />\nCatholics .specifically beyond<br />\n<br />\nadolescence?<br />\nYoung Catholics are like<br />\nyoung people in general. We wenti<br />\nthrough a period in the 60's of<br />\nthe most intense questioning of<br />\nany authority. Yes, there is an<br />\nincrease in questioning of<br />\nreligion, but also an increase in<br />\nthe practicing of the faith.<br />\nCatholics are more concerned<br />\nabout justice, racism and<br />\nanti-semitism than ever before.<br />\nDo you forsee the removal of<br />\nthe sanction against birth control?<br />\nNo, I do not. The Church<br />\nteaches that if you have four or<br />\nfive children, you do the best<br />\nthat you can. However, church<br />\nmoney is going into research of<br />\nhuman reproduction especially<br />\nthe time when conception will<br />\ntake place.<br />\nOne thing in Catholic teaching<br />\ntoday is do everything to build<br />\nup the family. We want better<br />\nquality and stronger families.<br />\nYoung people of the future are<br />\ngoing to be asked to go through<br />\nmore formal preparation for<br />\nmarriage than they have in the<br />\npast.<br />\nDo you feel that the church's<br />\nguide lines on birth control are<br />\nalienating any young Catholics?<br />\nUnfortunately, I do. On the<br />\nother hand, I believe that if the<br />\nyoung Catholics in question<br />\nwould take the time for more<br />\nextended study, they would be<br />\nless alienated. Maybe not fully<br />\nturned around, but not alienated.<br />\nAs a priest who hears the<br />\nconfessions of many, many<br />\nCatholics, I do not feel that one's<br />\nbelief on birth control is any<br />\nreason to leave the Catholic<br />\nchurch. I am very discouraged<br />\nbecause so many people put it on<br />\nthe par with many great<br />\nteachings of the church, and it is<br />\nnot! It certainly does affect<br />\nevery family but it is not on the<br />\npar with the great teachings. In<br />\nthe hierarchy of values, justice<br />\nand treating one's fellowman<br />\nwith some regard for personal<br />\ndignity is much more important.<br />\nI personally feel that the<br />\nscientific world will help us to<br />\nthis problem of<br />\novercome<br />\ndetermining when the possibliity<br />\nof conception will take place<br />\nmore precisely. This is a question<br />\nclearly in the hands of the .<br />\nmedical community. The church<br />\nis not against birth control but<br />\nagainst birth control by artificial<br />\nmeans. The pill is only about<br />\ntwenty-two years old and we<br />\nhave no long range data on it. We<br />\ndo not know how it is going to<br />\nbe affecting women who have<br />\nbeen on it for twenty years.<br />\nIs there anything that you<br />\nwould like to say to the students<br />\nthat you would not ordinarily<br />\ncome in contact with such as<br />\nstudents of other religious<br />\ndenominations?<br />\nAs a priest I am working in<br />\nclose connection with the Office<br />\nof the Chaplain. I would like<br />\neveryone to know that I am<br />\navailable to discuss any problems<br />\nthat they may have. I am willing<br />\nto be a resource person for<br />\npapers concerning the Catholic<br />\nreligion. For any person who<br />\nwants to talk to a priest for any<br />\nreason at all, I have a twenty-four<br />\nhour availability.

After the president comes<br />\nthe rest of the administration, who are in turn followed<br />\nby the faculty. Next come the graduate students, then the<br />\nundergraduates, from seniors on down to freshmen.<br />\nSomewhere amidst this ranking are places for the campus<br />\npolice, the Levering cafeteria workers, and even the staff<br />\nof the Eisenhower Library. But crouching uncomfortably<br />\nat the bottom of this conglomeration of academia , nuts,<br />\nthe low man on this motley totem pole, is the commuter.<br />\nEvery student at Hopkins has his problems. Everyone<br />\nsuffers the pangs and pains inherent in devoting four years<br />\nof his youthful prime to reading, writing papers and<br />\nstudying for exams into the wee hours of the morn. But<br />\nthere is the relief provided by a<br />\nfor most students<br />\nfeeling of camaraderie and community. The average<br />\nundergrad can retreat to his apartment and wallow in the<br />\nwarm companionship of his jolly roommates. The<br />\ncommuter, on the other hand, shuffles disconsolately to<br />\nhis '68 Mustang, hops on the surging smoggy roller coaster<br />\nknown as Baltimore rush hour traffic, and gets home just<br />\nin time to catch the last few rounds of his parents' latest<br />\nbout. However, he does share a small but cozy 8' by 11'<br />\ncubby hole with his little brother and a half-dozen Kiss<br />\nposters.<br />\nThe theme of commuter life is alienation. Commuters<br />\nare out-numbered on this campus by about 9 to 1. Even<br />\nGeneral Custer had better odds than those. I got a brief<br />\nbut potent glimpse of what I was getting myself into<br />\nwhen I joined my classmates for freshmen orientation two<br />\nyears ago. A fellow commuter and I arrived for the first of<br />\nthe Orientation activities, walking uncertainly towards the<br />\nfreshmen quad where the \"dormies\" (as we scornfully<br />\nlabeled them) were lugging trunks, settling into rooms and<br />\nintroducing themselves to one another. Smiles and<br />\nlaughter abounded and frisbees were already on the wing.<br />\nMy friend and I stood and watched as if behind a pane of<br />\nglass. Before long, an upperclassman with a clipboard<br />\napproached us and inquired, \"You guys commuters?\" We<br />\nnodded timidly. How pitiful we must have appeared that<br />\nhe could spot us so easily! \"Okay, then follow me,\" he<br />\nsaid, turning his back on us and strutting away. We<br />\nwalked close behind, happy and relieved that someone,<br />\nhowever curt, had acknowledged our presence. Our guide<br />\nled us into the New Dorm Building, through a hallway<br />\nand some swinging doors, into the Snack Bar and out a<br />\nback exit. \"Okay, this is it,\" he told us. We were now<br />\nstanding at the back of the dorm,surrounded on one side<br />\nby a trash dumpster, and on the other side by a huddled<br />\nmass of mum commuters. The scene suggested Exercise<br />\nHour at the state pen.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nCommuters often<br />\n<br />\nI looked around, wondering why it was necessary to<br />\ncorral the commuters to the back of the building, away<br />\nfrom the other freshmen. Were we carriers of some<br />\nstrange disease, some gruesome infectious malady that<br />\ncould cripple or blind the rest of the class should we come<br />\nin contact with them? I felt like asking, but I already felt<br />\nfoolish enough. The clipboard man gave a short speech<br />\nwelcoming \"you commuters\" to Hopkins, and he<br />\n\"hoped\" that our four years at JHU would be \"fun.\" For<br />\nsome reason, at that moment, as the pungent scent of the<br />\ntrash dumpster wafted under my nostrils, I envisioned the<br />\nnext four years as anything but fun. Before being<br />\ndismissed, each of us was handed a piece of paper listing<br />\nthe next few days' events, one of which was a meeting<br />\nwith President Muller at his house later that afternoon.<br />\n<br />\nMy introduction to the President sticks in my mind,<br />\nnot just because I was awed by his sunny complexion, but<br />\nalso because of his reaction when I told him I was a<br />\ncommuter. I stood in his den with three other freshmen<br />\n(all dormies, in fact). He chatted amiably with the other<br />\nthree about their hometowns and majors. It turned out he<br />\nwent to college with the father of one of them. Finally,<br />\nhe shook my hand and asked where I was from.<br />\n\"Baltimore,\" I answered. \"I'm a commuter.\"<br />\nInstantaneously (and I know it wasn't my imagination),<br />\nhis grip loosened and he appeared at a loss for words. He<br />\nsimply nodded his bronzed head, and the only ming this<br />\nworldly erudite man could manage to say was, \"So.<br />\nYou're a commuter, huh?\" Before I could reply, he said<br />\nto the four of us while sweeping a hand towards the door,<br />\n\"Well, it was nice meeting you all. Drop by again<br />\nsometime.\"<br />\nI'm told that a Hopkins undergrad, during his four-yelr<br />\n<br />\nout on many student activities, such as the Young Republicans'biannual taffy pull.<br />\n<br />\nstay here, meets President Muller two times; once during<br />\nfreshmen orientation, the second time at graduation.<br />\nWhen my time comes to step up onto the stage and<br />\nreceive my sheepskin and handshake from the President,<br />\nI'm going to say to him,\"In answer to your question: no,<br />\nactually, I used to be a commuter, but I'm not anymore.\"<br />\nI'm sure he won't have the foggiest idea what the hell I'm<br />\ntalking about.<br />\nNE THING<br />\nI LEARNED in two years of<br />\nat<br />\nFrench<br />\nHopkins (perhaps the one thing) was<br />\nthe French word for commuter: externe. It<br />\nconnotes alienation the way a \"Condemned\" sign<br />\nbespeaks ruin. The French tape from which I learned the<br />\nword detailed the trials and tribulations of a Parisian<br />\n<br />\nuniversity commuter. He is confused, lost, disorienti By<br />\nthe end of the tape, I really felt for the poor guy, like few<br />\nother people could. A classmate of his, a dormie no<br />\ndoubt, mocks him mercilessly. \"Vous etes exteme?<br />\nHahahahahahaha! C'est tris amusante!\"That derisive peal<br />\nof Gallic laughter riddled my heart like, bullets. To this<br />\nday, whenever I hear a Frenchman laugh, my fists clench<br />\nand my blood starts to boil.<br />\nI'm often asked,\"Why do commuters come to Hopkins<br />\n- in the first place? Didn't they want to go away to<br />\ncollege?\" You better believe most of us wanted to go<br />\naway. In fact, I still do (to Oahu if I could, but that's<br />\nanother story). The reason commuters come to Hopkins<br />\nin the first place (when it's often the third place they had<br />\nin mind) is money, or rather, the lack thereof. I remember<br />\nApril of my senior year in high school; I was bargaining<br />\nover the phone,long distance, with the college of my first<br />\nchoice, begging for additional financial aid. If I couldn't<br />\nwangle more bread out of this school, then I'd have to go<br />\nto Hopkins, and commute!<br />\nI sobbed into the<br />\n\"Please gimme more money!\"<br />\nmouthpiece as tears of panic rolled hotly down my face.<br />\nThe distant minute voice of the financial aid lady said.<br />\n\"You mentioned that you have a backup school that<br />\noffered you enough aid, right?\"<br />\n\"Yes,\" I sniffed.<br />\n\"Well, what school is that?' she asked.<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\n\"Well, that's a good school, too.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, but I wanna go to your school!\"<br />\n\"I'd like to lielp,young man, but we just don't have any<br />\nmore money to give out. I'm very sorry.\"<br />\nA tad upset, I hung up, and pretty hard too, because I<br />\nripped the phone off the wall.For the first time, I resolved<br />\nmyself to the fact that I would be attending Hopkins that<br />\nE nlike many commuters, I never developed a sense of<br />\nfalU<br />\nreverence towards Hopkins while I was growing up. The<br />\ncommon commuter will tell you stories of how, as a<br />\nyoung tot, he heard great things about JHU. He'll tell you<br />\nabout the feeling of respect and admiration that overcame<br />\nhim whenever his family drove up Charles Street and past<br />\nthe University on their way home from church. I too grew<br />\nup seeing and hearing a lot of this legendary college, but I<br />\nhad a slightly different conception of the place than most<br />\n<br />\n\fCo<br />\n<br />\nring<br />\nion.<br />\nand<br />\nlent,<br />\nno,<br />\n)re.\"<br />\nI'm<br />\nvo.<br />\n<br />\ns of<br />\nwas<br />\nIt<br />\nsign<br />\nthe<br />\ntsian<br />\n<br />\n'By<br />\nfew<br />\nno<br />\nwe?<br />\npeal<br />\nthis<br />\nnch<br />\n<br />\nkins<br />\nto<br />\ngo<br />\nlat's<br />\nkins<br />\nhad<br />\niber<br />\niing<br />\nfirst<br />\ncm 't<br />\n)go<br />\nthe<br />\nace.<br />\naid,<br />\nthat<br />\n<br />\nany<br />\nise I<br />\nlved<br />\nthat<br />\n! of<br />\nThe<br />\nis a<br />\nyou<br />\nime<br />\n)ast<br />\nrew<br />\nut I<br />\nlost<br />\n<br />\nkids.

I was too<br />\nyoung to realize how close these primordial impressions<br />\ncame to the truth.<br />\nE COMMUTERS HAVE A SAYING: \"Show<br />\nme the most pathetic, lonesome-looking<br />\ncreature on campus, and I'll show you a<br />\ncommuter.\" It's not very hard to spot one. You<br />\nmight want to try this interesting little experiment<br />\nsometime, just to discover how easy it is to pick a<br />\ncommuter out of the madding crowd. During any school<br />\nday at about 10:50 A M., sit on one of the benches<br />\n<br />\noutside of Levering Hall and watch the students walk to<br />\nand from their classes. Usually, a group of four or five<br />\npeople will amble by, cackling like hens on their way to a<br />\nfeeding. Occasionally, a lone student will straggle past, a<br />\nbulging knapsack on his back, the ubiquitous brown<br />\nlunchbag in his hand, and his eyes cast downward. If you<br />\ncould get a good look at his face, you'd find \"commuter\"<br />\nwritten all over it.<br />\nI have difficulty trying to imagine a more heart-rending<br />\nsight than that of the commuter sitting cross-legged and<br />\nalone in the middle of a quad, and eating a peanut<br />\nbutter and jelly sandwich or leftover chicken from a<br />\nbrown paper bag. Sometimes he will scatter bits of cake<br />\nor a few drumstick bones in hope that a passing pigeon or<br />\nsquirrel will stop and join him in his solitary repast. If<br />\nanyone can find a more pitiful picture, I'd like him to<br />\nshow it to me.<br />\nThe brown paper bag alone is enough to arouse shame<br />\nand embarrassment in any commuter. A week ago I<br />\narrived for my History of the French Revolution class and<br />\ntook a seat next to a non-commuter acquaintance of<br />\nmine. He leaned over and hissed in my ear, \"I suppose<br />\nthis class by<br />\nyou realize how you degrade everyone in<br />\nHe picked<br />\nday.\"<br />\nevery<br />\nbringing in that stupid lunch bag<br />\nface.<br />\nGrease<br />\nmy<br />\nin<br />\nsly<br />\ncontemptuou<br />\nup the bag and held it<br />\nwere<br />\ncookies<br />\noatmeal<br />\nhomemade<br />\nstains from my mother's<br />\n\"You<br />\nshould<br />\npaper.<br />\nbrown<br />\nthe<br />\nover<br />\nall<br />\nslowly spreading<br />\ncontinued. \"It makes us<br />\nbe ashamed,\" my acquaintance<br />\nI hung my head<br />\nfeel like we're back in fifth grade again.\"<br />\nme. \"I'll bet<br />\nberated<br />\nhe<br />\nStill<br />\nand muttered an apology.<br />\nand one of<br />\nhere,<br />\nin<br />\negg<br />\nhard-boiled<br />\nyou've even got a<br />\non the<br />\nsplotches<br />\nblack<br />\nwith<br />\nbananas<br />\nthose short ugly<br />\nskin!\"<br />\nnightmare.

It's<br />\nbad enough living in Dundalk or Timonium, but having to<br />\nresort to the Maryland Transit Authority for your daily<br />\nconveyance is adding insult to injury.<br />\nMore and more these days I've been having trouble<br />\nwith my car (a '49 Hudson which once belonged to<br />\nAverill Harriman's barber). On those mornings when the<br />\ncar refuses to budge, I catch the bus. About a month ago,<br />\nI boarded the number 11 and sat next to an old man who<br />\nimmediately began recounting the history of his gall<br />\nbladder. He showed me the scar from his prostrate<br />\n<br />\noperation, and then he took out his teeth. I got off the<br />\nbus, about four miles from my stop, and started walking.<br />\nI could have hitch-hiked but I swore off that mode of<br />\ntransportation a few years ago when it became obvious<br />\nthat the only people who would pick me up were<br />\nhomosexuals and Moonies.<br />\nContending with the campus police is another hassle<br />\nthat befalls the commuter alone. To resident students, the<br />\n\"campus clowns\" serve merely as a source of humor,<br />\nwhile the commuter must beware parking tickets and the,<br />\noccasional kidnapping of his car. Signs all over Hopkins<br />\nparking lots ominously announce, \"Unless your car has a<br />\nparking sticker, it will be towed to Greenwood's Garage<br />\non North Avenue.\" I have awful visions of this<br />\nGreenwood's Garage, of masked men clad in black,<br />\nchuckling viciously as they stick the burning ends of<br />\ncigarettes against my car, and then calling me in in the<br />\nmiddle of the night, telling me where to drop off the<br />\n<br />\nransom in case I ever want to see my car again.<br />\nWhat I resent of the resident student the most is that<br />\ntwo or three times a year he returns to New Jersey or<br />\nLong Island for a hero's welcome. His family sees him so<br />\ninfrequently that when he does go home, he receives the<br />\nroyal treatment: little sister waiting on him hand and<br />\nfoot, old buddies coming around to visit, Dad treating<br />\neveryone to a big spread at a fancy restaurant. The<br />\ncommuter goes home every day, but his reception is,<br />\n\"Here comes the geek, tracking leaves on my new carpet<br />\nagain!\" These are the rare occasions on which I actually<br />\nwish I lived in New Jersey.<br />\nAs I stated before, sometimes this jealousy of the<br />\nresident student blossoms into full-fledged, one-hundred<br />\nproof hatred. One commuter friend of mine (who, I<br />\nadmit, is wrapped none too tightly) has told me of a<br />\ncertain scheme he is devising. He plans to drive his car up<br />\nthe service lane in front of the Library (all the time<br />\n\"putting the pedal to the metal,\" as we say), hang a left<br />\nonto Gilman Quad, and run over any resident students he<br />\nhappens to see. \"And if they duck inside buildings,\" he'<br />\nwhispers diabolically, \"I'll go right in after 'em, car and<br />\nall. Great idea, huh?\"<br />\nHE<br />\ni UNIVERSITY is currently<br />\nconstructing a brick wall at the school's back<br />\nentrance off Wyman Park Drive. Every day<br />\nwhen I pull out of the Garland Hall parking lot<br />\n(designated as Lot P on the little campus map that<br />\ncommuters receive every year), I look up and watch the<br />\ngateway of this brick wall shrink in my rear-view mirror as<br />\nI drive away. The money being used to build this wall (a<br />\nwall I am gradually coming to detest) should be spent on<br />\na commuter monument. This monument could be<br />\nmodeled on the Statue of Liberty: a commuter, sculpted<br />\nin pewter, standing on a pedestal, his left arm clutching a<br />\nknapsack to his heart, his right arm raised high, holding<br />\naloft a grease-stained brown paper lunch bag. The<br />\ninscription on the base of the monoment should be simple<br />\nbut stirring, something like,\"Give me your tired, your<br />\npoor:your commuters yearning to breathe free...\"<br />\nOne final thought: I'm sitting here trying to figure out<br />\nhow many miles I will have driven in four years of<br />\ncommuting to Hopkins. I live five miles from school, so<br />\nthat's ten miles a day. Fifty miles a week, two hundred<br />\nmiles a month (and this doesn't include driving down for<br />\nextra-curriculars and social events). That's 1800 miles a<br />\nyear, so in four years I will have. driven 7200 miles! Yet,<br />\nI'll have never gotten more than five miles away from my<br />\nfront door. Somehow it seems a tremendous waste of<br />\ntime and fossil fuel. 7200 miles! I could have made it to<br />\nOahu easy, with a few extra miles to spare.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nII<br />\ncampus cop puts the screws to another commuter.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I NOVEMBER 10, 1978<br />\n<br />\nPraise The $34 *?$!(/<br />\n1<br />\n4P$ Lord!<br />\nBY MARC NASDOR<br />\n\"Healed!\" Thaesiwhat he said. \"Thou deaf and dumb<br />\nspirits, come...OUT!\" With a wild motion like a moth<br />\ntaking flight, he yanked his thumbs simultaneously from<br />\nthe ears of the little deaf Or!.

Dozens of.<br />\npeople were hired to keep things (the audience) in order.<br />\nThe introduction consisted of a plastic-faced,<br />\npolyester-suited man who came out on stage to warm up<br />\nthe audience in a manner reminiscent of the days of Truth<br />\nor Consequences, finishing off with--\"And now, ladies<br />\nand gentlemen, here's your evangelist and mine...Ernest<br />\nAngley!\" The crowd roared. Then out stepped the Boss,<br />\nin all his Caucasian glory. I only wish there was enough<br />\nspace in this newspaper for a transcription of the entire<br />\nshow; it would have sent the Pope into a cold sweat. One<br />\nthing was obvious, this man was a master at hypnotism.<br />\nFor over three hours, with the help of his goons and<br />\n<br />\ncronies, he had them in the palms of his hands. The<br />\nretarded, deformed, crippled--all of them--were held in his<br />\ntrance while he spewed out his demonic spiel. It was<br />\nAll-American, All-God, and most importantly, All-Ernest<br />\nAngley. At one point he complained that the Baltimore<br />\nSunpapers' had refused to allow him to place his<br />\nadvertisement announcing the ministry in the paper; then<br />\nhe commanded every one of them, I should say us, to<br />\nwrite letters to the Editor, even to call the Editor up<br />\npersonally. The audience responded with an ear-splitting<br />\n\"HALLELUJAH!\"<br />\nPart two was the fundraising, cameras off, which lasted<br />\nmore than an hour. This was what made me sick to my<br />\nstomach. As Ernest preached, at least a dozen ushers<br />\ncombed the aisles for contributions, BIG contributions. A<br />\nwhite, gallon-sized bucket was passed down my row. As I<br />\nzipped it by, I looked inside and saw more cash than I<br />\nhave ever seen in my -life, with the exception of my<br />\n<br />\nelementary school tour of the Bureau of Engraving and<br />\nPrinting. I was tempted to grab a* handful, but luckily I<br />\nturned around to see the six-foot-four, two hundred fifty<br />\npound goon staring right at me. I quickly passed the<br />\nbucket. At a designated time Ernest announced that the<br />\nministry would be ever so appreciative if everyone would<br />\nbe so kind as to hold up a crisp one-dollar bill, so that<br />\nthey could pay for renting the hall. \"It would be like an<br />\nact of love,\" he said, \"your covenant with Gawd!\"Like<br />\nautumn leaves, the George Washingtons were held up in<br />\nthe air for the ushers to gracefully pluck from their hands.<br />\nOne has to see this to believe it; the poorest of the poor<br />\ngiving, literally, their life savings away.<br />\nFinally, part three, the healing. I was wearing a<br />\nten-year-old black tuxedo with tapered legs and ragged<br />\nred velvet trim, tennis shoes, a nylon flowered leisure suit<br />\nshirt, and rainbow suspenders, so I easily blended in with<br />\nthe crowd. Ernest was picking people out of the audience<br />\nto come up to the stage and get healed: deaf people, blind<br />\npeople, bad backs and crooked limbs. I suspected that<br />\nmany of the fifty-or-so people were planted. It seemed<br />\nthat I would not have my chance to get in line. I was<br />\ngetting cold feet, but my two friends who had<br />\naccompanied me egged me on, so I decided to give it a go.<br />\nI stood at the back of the line, shaking with the nervous<br />\nfits I had designated for myself. A man came up to me<br />\nand asked what I was doing there. I put on the act and he<br />\nfell for it. The line moved quickly. This was it, me on<br />\nnational television.. Some of the shaking was definitely<br />\nreal. Closer and closer, I found myself tripping up the<br />\nwooden steps onto the stage-. I was on the stage. About<br />\nhalf a dozen men, women and children were lying down<br />\nflat, face up on the stage in rapture. One of the<br />\nsinger-bodyguards grabbed me by the arms and led me to<br />\nwhere the Master stood. He spoke to me: \"Are you born<br />\nagain?\" I shoud have said no, but I was petrified.<br />\n\"PRAISE GOD\" blurted from my lips. With a fervent<br />\n\"YAY-YAH!\" he slapped me on the top of my head. I let<br />\nout a grunt and a \"thank you Jesus\" and collapsed<br />\nbackwards. Two of the bodyguards caught me and placed<br />\nme on the blue velvet stage. I quivered on the ground,<br />\nfaking an orgasm, whispering \"love ya Jesus\" over and<br />\nover. Then I got up and was led by one of the bodyguards<br />\nto the side of the stage, where I continued my enraptured<br />\ntwitching while Angley played around with the<br />\nwheelchair section in the front. Finally I was led off the<br />\nstage. I made tracks and bolted out of that place faster<br />\nthan an angel fleeing from Heaven, knocking over some<br />\ncripples acidentally. I never looked back.<br />\nFor the next half hour, my friends and I were<br />\nspeechless. They just couldn't believe I had gone through<br />\nwith it. I didn't care any more; I just wanted to get the<br />\nhell out of there.<br />\nI have repeated this story many times to reactions of<br />\ncomplete disbelief. I'm glad it's over. I think I'll go back<br />\nto being a heathen; it's a lot safer. By the way, in case<br />\nanyone doesn't believe me, the show is on every Sunday<br />\nevening from 10 to 11 p.m. on Channel 45 in Baltimore.<br />\nP.T.L.<br />\n<br />\nGoucher Replies: Hopkins Men Don't Satisfy<br />\nIt is a known fact that the greater institutions of higher!<br />\neducation most often have rigid discriminatory<br />\nrequirements for the entrance of students who will<br />\nuphold the reputation of such institutions. The criteria<br />\nfor those applying to Johns Hopkins University are,<br />\nhowever, above and beyond the reach of most men.<br />\nTherefore, those men who have acquired this elite status<br />\nare to be honored and so, we pay homage to those<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nHopkins students are so over-intellectualized that they<br />\nare only capable of speakingein one syllable words. Hence,<br />\nthe names: \"The Rat,\" \"The Hut,\" \"The House.\" Can<br />\nthey say \"Goucher?\"<br />\nSpeaking of Goucher, where would the Rat be without<br />\nthose young, attractive, red-blooded American women to<br />\nadd a new dimension to the otherwise desolate social<br />\natmosphere? After all, what's a cattle auction without the<br />\nbuyers? The buyers are personally invited to pinch, pat,<br />\nand prod the stock for sleekness, good health, and girth.<br />\nThe cattle are then sold, to the' highest bidder, and<br />\nanxiously follow to whatever fate may await them.<br />\nThe typical Hopkins male outing consists of<br />\nfrequenting the Rat where he constantly takesadvantage<br />\nof the opportunity to pat, pinch, and gawkr at every<br />\npassing female, who in most cases is of higher quality than<br />\nhe.. The other opportunity for these men to display their<br />\nsuperior intelligence is the gathering of animalistic herds<br />\nat the infamous fraternity parties. tonversing with the ,<br />\n<br />\nassorted collection of the male faction of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity who partaxe of the festivities may be difficult<br />\nunless one is familiar with the unique terminology used.<br />\nTo aid our readers, some examples are included.<br />\nAre you from C.O.N.D.O.M. or Goucher?<br />\n*take another shot of teciuilg.<br />\nDo you need a place to stay tonight?<br />\ntranslate to:<br />\nI'm from D.U.<br />\nI'm a member of A.T.O.<br />\nI belong to G.A.M.<br />\nStill, Hopkins men are not without their own<br />\nparticular brand of chivalry. Any or even all would gladly<br />\noffer their own bed to any girl stranded without a ride back to<br />\nher dorm. It also stands to reason that their offer contains<br />\na peculiar twist. They would hate to see some poor girl<br />\nleft alone, so their bed would not be solely yours for the<br />\nnight.<br />\nYet, we do not want to leave you with the unjustifiable<br />\n<br />\nmyth that Hopkins men do not work diligently at their<br />\nstudies, so now, an inside view of the study habits<br />\nbelonging to that rare species--the Hopkins male.<br />\nFinals time is when everyone really gets down to some<br />\nheavy nerding-put. Hutzler's Undergraduate Library<br />\n(better known as \"The Hut\") is absolutely buzzing with<br />\nintellectuals deep in thought over upcoming finals.<br />\nA typical night at \"The Hut\" during this first semester<br />\nof last year eloquently portrayed the intellectual level of<br />\nthe students. A plastic punching bag was inflated and beat<br />\nupon by a large percentage of the male students. Now,<br />\nthis may seem highly intellectual to many, but think of<br />\nhow much brain power it took to put a sweater, a hat and<br />\nglasses on the dummy. If these actions appear juvenile to<br />\nyou, do not fear--you have yet to reach that level of<br />\nmentality, but, with practice and much work, it can be<br />\nachieved.<br />\nAren't these Hopkins men truly incredible? They, by<br />\nmethods only surpassed in National Lampoon' s Anima 1<br />\nHouse, are truly dedicated to rendering their endless<br />\nendeavors of acquiring a higher education worthwhile.<br />\nWhere do they a!l go once JHU can no- longer fill their<br />\nminds with pre-med jargon? They scatter about across the<br />\nworld but they never discontinue their journey to worlds<br />\nof still greater intellectual capacities. No, not the Hopkins<br />\nmale; he is forever seeking to become well-educated in all<br />\nfaculties of life and is unmatched in his dedication to<br />\nreach the highest state possible (of education?).<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nI!<br />\n<br />\nh'<br />\n<br />\n!<br />\n<br />\n1.1. \u2022<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nRUG CONCERT<br />\nThe Peabody Contemporary<br />\nMusic Ensemble<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz, conductor<br />\nOtto Luening, commentator<br />\nProgram of works by Varese:<br />\nOctandre<br />\nDeserts<br />\nPoeme Electronique for Tape<br />\nfree admission<br />\nWednesday, November 15<br />\n8:15 p.m.<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 I NOVEMBER 10, 1978<br />\n<br />\nBLOOD DRIVE<br />\nMIN NI<br />\n<br />\nMIN INNINII<br />\n<br />\nIN NIIN<br />\n<br />\nMIIN MINIMUM.IN<br />\n<br />\nTHURSDAY,NOV.16<br />\n8:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m.<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br />\n<br />\nCall ext. 8052 for an appointment<br />\n\u2022 or sign up in room 146, Garland.<br />\n<br />\nTECHNOLOGY AND<br />\nPOLICY AT MIT<br />\n<br />\nhAppENiNgs<br />\nNOVEMbER<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nPIT<br />\n<br />\nA MASTER OF SCIENCE<br />\nPROGRAM designed for persons<br />\nwanting to participate in<br />\nformulating policies for the<br />\ndevelopment, use and control of<br />\ntechnology and its consequences.<br />\nStudents form individual curricula<br />\nto work on issues such as solar<br />\nenergy, the economics and legal<br />\naspects of materials recycling and<br />\nthe use of automation in<br />\nmanufacturing.<br />\n<br />\nFor information write:<br />\nProf. Richard de Neufville<br />\nRm 1-138, Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology<br />\nCambridge, Massachusetts<br />\n02139<br />\n<br />\nHome of the<br />\n<br />\n10 MINUTE<br />\nOIL CHANGE<br />\nOUR ONLY BUSINESS<br />\n<br />\nLyopE, OIL & FILTER<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\n<br />\nThanks to you...<br />\nit works...<br />\nfor ALL OF US<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nRATIISkEUAR<br />\n<br />\n/THE<br />\n<br />\n$<br />\n<br />\n95<br />\n<br />\nFEATURING<br />\nPENNZOIL<br />\n10W-40<br />\n<br />\nPLUS<br />\nFOREIGN<br />\nTAX<br />\nCARS<br />\nPLUS FREE UNDERH000 R.UID CHECK<br />\n<br />\n1025 WEST 41st ST. 235-6336<br />\nBETWEEN FALLS ROAD & ROLAND AVENUE<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4 MILE WEST OF ROTUNDA MALL<br />\n<br />\nROAST BEEF ON RYE, YES?<br />\n<br />\nUnited Way<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nbracadabra,<br />\nI sit on his knee.<br />\nPresto chango,<br />\nand now he is me.<br />\nHocus pocus,<br />\nwe take her to bed.<br />\nMagic is fun;<br />\nwe're dead.<br />\n<br />\nCOUNTRY-ROCK<br />\n<br />\nLiz Meyer & The<br />\nMidnight Flyers<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\nLIVE DISCO BAND.<br />\nMeadow<br />\n\u2022<br />\n*DISCO<br />\n<br />\n16<br />\n17<br />\n<br />\nMilton<br />\nFreewater Band<br />\n<br />\n18<br />\nLIVE DISCO WITH<br />\n<br />\nStardate Band<br />\n<br />\n23, 24, & 25<br />\nTURKEY BREAK<br />\n<br />\n30 * DISCO<br />\ndECEMbER\"<br />\nBOOGIE WITH<br />\n<br />\nBrandy<br />\nClimbadonkey<br />\n<br />\n* DISCO<br />\n<br />\nMAGIC<br />\nATERRIFYING LOVE STORY<br />\n<br />\nJOSEPH E.LEVINE PRESENTS<br />\nMAGIC<br />\nANTHONY HOPKINS ANN-MARGRET<br />\nBURGESS MEREDITH ED LAUTER<br />\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER C.O.

He placed<br />\nand the next morning he found<br />\nan ad in the newspar,.<br />\nthey told him their tragic<br />\nWhen<br />\nmodels.<br />\ntwo aspiring<br />\nstory, the artist quickly hired them. But after a few days,<br />\nthe artist realized that they were not what he wanted. He<br />\nput another ad in the paper, and the next morning<br />\nanother couple appeared at his door. The man and the<br />\nwoman were both professional models, and the artist<br />\nsuccessfully completed his painting.<br />\nThe preceding anecdote demonstrates the talent needed<br />\nto portray stereotypes. The genius of Born Yesterday, the<br />\nnew play at Center Stage, rests on exactly that. Though<br />\nevery character is a cliche, each actor manages to play his<br />\nrole exactly right--neither denigrating into farcical<br />\nself-caricature nor ascending to heights of pompous<br />\nimportance.<br />\nThe plot is simple. Immediately following the end of<br />\nWorld War II, a junkyard.. boss/hoodlum goes to<br />\nWashington DC to take advantage of the flow of scrap<br />\nmetal returning from overseas. In order to do so, he needs<br />\nspecial legislation to rescind restrictions on \"free<br />\nenterprise.\" So he obtains the best Senator money can<br />\nbuy. The complication arises when this Boss realizes that<br />\nhis uncouth \"dumb blonde\" girlfriend could be a social<br />\nliability. He entrusts her to an investigative journalist<br />\nwho, in the grand manner of Henry Higgins, exposes his<br />\nLiza Doolittle to literature and learning and falls in love<br />\nwith her. The hitherto \"dumb blonde\" wises up, and<br />\nturns the table on the boss and political corruption. In the<br />\nend, democracy wins, and the journalist-professor and his<br />\nconcubine-protege marry and presumably live happily<br />\never after.<br />\nThe characters are even more conventional than the<br />\nplot. The \"dumb blonde,\" aptly named Billie Dawn,<br />\nwears revealing outfits more appropriate for the chorus<br />\nline than for the most expensive hotel room in the capital.<br />\nShe slinks suggestively up and down the staircase, uttering<br />\nsuch gems as \"I'm stupid and I like it.\" Even her<br />\ntransformation does little to alter her basic personality; to<br />\n<br />\nSergiu Comissiono<br />\nKeith leIrrett<br />\n<br />\nwit, \"Last night I went to bed wonderin' and thinkin',<br />\nand I couldn't get to sleep for ten minutes!\" Harry Brock,<br />\npossibly a relative of Saturday Night's tax fraud people, is<br />\nthe Boss; though he displays street cunning and crude<br />\npower, he is just as \"dumb\" as his girlfriend. A typical<br />\nline: \"You ain't gonna be tellin' nobody nothin' soon.\"<br />\nPaul Verrall, the journalist and moral descendant of<br />\nThomas Paine, delivers long-winded speeches on the value<br />\nof government of the people, by the people, and for the<br />\npeople. The fourth principal, Ed Devery, is the epitome of<br />\nthe smart, idealistic lawyer who sold out for Big Bucks.<br />\nHe is uncompromisingly cynical and drunk. When his boss<br />\nremarks, \"I'm a junk man,\" and the Senator replies,<br />\n\"That's no disgrace in America,\" Devery quips, \"Not if<br />\nyou're a big enough junk man.\"<br />\nIn short, everything about the play is a cliche. Only the<br />\nactors give it the life that it would lack in less competent<br />\nhands. Christine Baranski (Billie Dawn) has the voice and<br />\nmannerisms down to a \"T.\" The classic scene has her<br />\nplaying gin with the Boss. She intricately rearranges her<br />\ncards and adds up points on her fingers. Her Brooklyn<br />\naccent is flawless.<br />\nNorman Smith (Harry Brock) comes on strong--almost<br />\nstrong enough to steal the play from his co-star. His voice<br />\nresonates with the rough pride of a poor boy made good<br />\nand he refuses to bend to sophisticated gents; they must<br />\naccept him while he flexes his toes on the coffee table.<br />\nRobert Pastene (Ed Devery) is alternately wincing and<br />\nfalling lower in his self-esteem. His delivery is flawless; his<br />\nbest speech is one in which he drunkenly reels off a<br />\nnumber of unconvincing maxims that Harry cannot<br />\nunderstand.<br />\nEnsemble theatre has long been a hallmark of Center<br />\nStage. Actors often turn up in several of the season's<br />\nproductions; those with big parts in one play may as often<br />\nas not have smaller ones in the next. This is the case with<br />\nRichard Malone (Bellhop), who played the son in The<br />\nShadow Box, and Daniel Szelag (the Assistant Manager),<br />\nwho played the interviewer in The Shadow Box and tod(<br />\n'part in several of last season's productions.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the acting makes this play. But the<br />\n, actors are not only adding clever mannerisms to their<br />\n<br />\nlEptertaimpept<br />\n<br />\ncompilEd by<br />\nChRisTy 110 ANdERSON<br />\nSTEplIEN bARR<br />\nSTEVE RANdAll<br />\n<br />\nrre<br />\n<br />\nBilly Joel<br />\n<br />\nSorcet<br />\n<br />\nBorn Y<br />\n<br />\n10CC<br />\n<br />\nRECENT<br />\nRECORd<br />\nRELEASES<br />\n<br />\nroles; they also evoke sympathy. Harry Brock, the<br />\nphilistine hoodlum, is pathetic when he stalks the<br />\nwindow, waiting for his girlfriend to return. When she<br />\nrefuses his desperate offer of marriage, we feel a twinge of<br />\npity--until we shake ourselves and realize just who it is<br />\nthat we are pitying. The same is true in the case of Billie<br />\nDawn. She is funny, yet touching, when she parrots her<br />\nmentor's homily about \"the happy peasant.'<br />\nThe set is second only to the acting in excellence. The<br />\n1940's drawing room is decorated in expensive kitsch.<br />\nSymmetrical cupids grace the double doors; the coffee<br />\ntable looks like it came from one of the swankest Howard<br />\nJohnson motels.<br />\nFinally, credit must be given to the director, Steven<br />\nRobman, fori making two very astute decisions: 1) not to<br />\nupdate the play to make it another Watergate rehash, and<br />\n2) not to play the \"democracy triumphant\" scene at the<br />\nend for laughs. Both decisions reflect artistic maturity and<br />\nexperience.<br />\n<br />\nBILLY JOEL<br />\n52nd STREET<br />\nLet it be known! Billy Joel has made it! For years, Joel<br />\nwas the spokesman for the suburban counter-culture of<br />\nthe Seventies, but now he has assimilated the success<br />\nformula for a pop hit. His previous album, The Stranger,<br />\nwas milked for four singles, the fourth one beginning to<br />\nget airplay about the time the new album was released.<br />\nEvery song on 52nd Street has so many hooks you can't<br />\nhelp being snagged by the catchy melodies and the 'bad<br />\nboy' lyrics which have turned sweet. Two songs, \"Big<br />\nShot\" and \"My Life\" have already made their way into<br />\nTop 40 circles, and undoubtedly, there are more to come.<br />\nIt's not that this new album is bad - the music is too<br />\nlikable to be rejected - but it is a shame that one of rock's<br />\nmost insightful raconteurs must be lost for a pop star. SB<br />\nMORE 0111<br />\n<br />\np. 20<br />\n<br />\nMY SONG<br />\nKEITH JARRETT,<br />\nWhen formulating a critical response to music, it is<br />\ncustomary to try to draw on familiar analogies and<br />\nmetaphors. By relating the music to something in, the<br />\nphysical world, the reader gets the best sense of the<br />\nemotions and experiences the music is trying to evoke.<br />\nThis is not possible when responding to the music of<br />\nKeith Jarrett. One is forced into superlatives: this new<br />\nalbum of traditional and avant-garde compositions for<br />\njazz quartet is simply exquisite. The emphasis on most<br />\ntrack s is on melody, making this one of Jarrett's most<br />\naccessible albums. The slower songs, especially the title<br />\ncut, are beautiful and refreshing, making you feel calm<br />\nand relaxed. The more upbeat songs make you want to<br />\nget up and dance with joy. And when you've finished<br />\nlistening to the album, you want Jarrett right there so you<br />\ncan thank him for making you feel so good. The melodic<br />\nblend of Jarrett's sensitive piano and Jan Garbarek's<br />\nemotional saxophones make this one of the most- pleasing<br />\nalbums to listen to. But the only way to understand this is<br />\nto listen to the record and experience these feelings. I<br />\ncan't tell what they are like, only what they are.<br />\nSBA<br />\n<br />\nBROTHER TO BROTHER<br />\nGINO VANNELL1<br />\nThis is an album of power and romance. Certainly the<br />\nmost successful of Vanelli's works, this amazing effort<br />\nmust be considered the culmination of the artist's most<br />\nindividual style. The album is a continuation of the<br />\nVannelli touch: rock, disco, and jazz fused into a clean<br />\nelement of force, motion and sensuality. The appeal of<br />\nthis work is the unity which the artist was able to achieve.<br />\nIt is an ebb and flow from song to song, but this highly<br />\nindividual style maintains a continuity which is<br />\ninsurpassable. The particulars of the cut do not matter, as<br />\nin \"I Just Wanna Stop,\" the single released from the<br />\nalbum, a slow and passionate release of emotion; and the<br />\ntitle song, \"Brother to Brother,\" an exuberant exercise of<br />\nthe Vannelli method. The strength of both songs is in<br />\ntheir ability to transcend the bounds of subject matter<br />\nand musical technicalities. The process of controlled<br />\nemotion and force is the theme of the entire work, a<br />\ntheme which cannot be held by a single style such as roc-k<br />\nor jazz. It needs the control of a fusion of styles. This<br />\nuniversality reaches its height in \"The River Must Flow.\"<br />\nVannelli grabs at the first note of this cut and refuses to<br />\nallow the listener to escape. His songs present this process<br />\neffectively throughout the album. He is an artist moving<br />\nin one \u2022 direction, toward a music which captivates and<br />\nholds the audience. Vannelli is in command of his art, an<br />\nart which is all his own.<br />\nCJA<br />\nTHE ESSENTIAL<br />\nJIMI HENDRIX<br />\nThis fellow definitely shows some promise as a guitar<br />\nplayer. Rumor has it that Hendrix, a black man, was<br />\ninspired to master the guitar after claiming to have been<br />\nspoken to by the ghost of Frank Marino while on a<br />\nparticularly bad acid trip, but we all know how<br />\ntrustworthy these drugged-out rockers are. Although<br />\nsounding at times!like -a throwback to the psychedelia of<br />\nthe late 60's, Hendrix occasionally displays flashes of<br />\nsheer brilliance. His strategic use of feedback, while<br />\ncertainly not innovative, is, nonetheless, often quite<br />\nengaging. With some better material and a little luck, Jimi<br />\ncould very well be the next Robin Trower. Keep an eye<br />\non him...<br />\nSR<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 18 INOVEMBER 10, 1978<br />\n<br />\nFrom Bucharest To Baltimore<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR and VINAY LAL<br />\n<br />\nSergiu Comissiona, searching for greater musical and<br />\npolitical freedom, came to the United States to take the<br />\npost of conductor and music director of the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra. In his ten -years here,_ he has<br />\ndeveloped a third-rate organization into one of the<br />\npremier orchestras in America. His main commitment is in<br />\nBaltimore, but he has also gained world-wide recognition<br />\nfrom his work as music advisor to the American<br />\nSymphony Orchestra\u2014the\" orchestra that governs<br />\nitself--and from his stints as guest conductor with almost<br />\nevery major orchestra. This final segment of a two-part<br />\ninterview deals with his work with the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony and his thoughts about Baltimore, America<br />\nand life itself.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Do you think an orchestra has a responsibility to<br />\nthe public to present contemporary works?<br />\nI think yes. If you are in New York and the New<br />\nYork Philharmonic doesn't do something, you'll go to<br />\nanother orchestra. You have, every day, many different<br />\norchestras, you have different groups. But here in<br />\nBaltimore, as being the main musical organization, you<br />\nhave an obligation to the community. We are not the<br />\nmusic teacher of the city, but I think I had a difficult task<br />\nin Baltimore, with all respect to my predecessors, because<br />\nthey performed here a very limited repertoire. I'm not<br />\nsuch a genius that I could perform one hundred new<br />\nworks in Baltimore, but from this hundred, I don't know<br />\nhow many werevery solid repertoire works which had<br />\nnever been done in Baltimore. Not all the Schubert, not<br />\nRite ofSpring, not...I don't know. If you look at this list<br />\nit's amazing what was done for the first time here. You<br />\ncan't have an orchestra without hearing these things. It's<br />\nnot only new adventurous contemporary works, but I had<br />\nto fill some very important gaps.<br />\n<br />\nllustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br />\n<br />\nWhat. major changes have taken place with the BSO<br />\nsince you have come to Baltimore to make the orchestra<br />\nso respected in America?<br />\nI think it is becoming one of the very important<br />\norchestras in America. lam very proud of them because<br />\nthe orchestra themselves must be credited. I hope I helped<br />\nthem, but I think they should be credited with this<br />\nenormous development. But I think, apart of this, I must<br />\nbe credited with things I did in Baltimore that hadn't<br />\nbeen done before. This is my tenth anniversary season,<br />\nand I have a list of what I have done to musicmaking in<br />\nBaltimore during my ten years. These are: five hundred<br />\nfifty-four concerts, more than one hundred new works<br />\nthat I did in Baltimore\u2014never before performed here, over<br />\nsixty American composers., I think that not only for an<br />\norchestra is this important, but the public, too, was<br />\nexposed to new music. Not as much as I would like, but I<br />\nhave whetted an appetite for music and new things in<br />\nBaltimore. The orchestra is doing new things, travelling<br />\nand going to the Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall,<br />\npresenting our flag with honor always. We have started to<br />\nmake records. We have a young conductors competition<br />\nin Baltimore which won national attraction. And we have<br />\nnew instruments for the musicians coming here. Anyone<br />\nwho wants to buy a new instrument can get the money,<br />\nand pay it back in ten years without any interest. This is<br />\nvery important. And most of it, more than anything, I<br />\nthink the orchestra achieved a sense of pride which they<br />\ndidn't have before. For this I am very proud of them.<br />\n<br />\nCould you explain the conflicts and causes of the<br />\nstrike this summer?<br />\nIt is very easy. The orchestra, as I said before was<br />\nmusically and also financially retarded. And the orchestra<br />\nhad a very fast development. We grew fast musically, but<br />\nfinancially we grew very slow. So it was, and still is, not<br />\nbalanced--the artistic stature we have now and our<br />\nsalaries. This was the main reason for the strike, and even<br />\nwith the three-year contract, the orchestra is still<br />\nunderpaid compared to other orchestras of our standing.<br />\nWe made major steps with this contract to bring the<br />\norchestra up to the same level as others, but still it is not.<br />\nCertainly this represents always a dangeer for our<br />\ndevelopment. In our lives, everyone wants to have a better<br />\nlife, and is tempted by better salaries of other orchestras.<br />\n<br />\nWhat do you think of rock music and how do ybu<br />\nrelate it to the music to which you have dedicated your<br />\nlife?<br />\nLike all good men, I try to understand the music,<br />\nsometimes even to enjoy it. I don't try to reject it. If it is<br />\ntoo noisy, yes. With the harder rock, the noise is so<br />\nimpossible that it is no longer music. It destroys the ears,<br />\ndestroys the taste. It is like eating, though. I think that I<br />\ncompare this kind of music with dessert, with ice cream,<br />\nwith popcorn. You cannot eat only popcorn andice<br />\ncream. You need the proteins and the vitamins, the good<br />\nfood. Otherwise you will destroy your organism if all you<br />\neat is junk food. I enjoy having a hot dog on the street,<br />\nbut I think, still, you need to eat properly. Like in<br />\nliterature. You can't just read the magazines and papers.<br />\nYou have to read a good book.<br />\n<br />\nHow does life today in Rumania compare with life<br />\nin America, and do you feel you will ever want to go<br />\nback?<br />\nI don't have a desire now like I did<br />\nhave. Four years ago I visited my home, the cemetary<br />\nwhere my father is. I saw a couple of friends. But I am an<br />\nAmerican citizen. I feel like an American citizen. This is<br />\nmy home. Probably I will have the desire to go back and I<br />\nwill, but my life is in America.<br />\nI left Rumania ten years ago, but I have conductor<br />\nfriends who have told me what it's like. There is an<br />\nenormous desire for progress. There are some very fine<br />\nmusicians, and there is a lot of activity. The good thing is<br />\nthat they are helped. There are many orchestras. They<br />\nare trained. The state is paying for the music education,<br />\nso they are developing a lot of musicians. THere are other,<br />\nvery bad, things. For instance, the musician is obliged to<br />\nretire after twenty-five years of service. So if he starts at<br />\ntwenty or twenty-one, at forty-six he is retired. A<br />\nmusician of my age--and I don't consider myself very<br />\nold--should not have to retire now. I think I am hungry to<br />\ndo more, but they are obliged to retire.There is no<br />\nparadise on earth, not for the musician, the doctor, not<br />\nfor anyone.<br />\n<br />\nSergiu Comissiona<br />\nWe lost during the years a number of very fine musicians<br />\nwho were attracted by other major orchestras paying<br />\nmore money.<br />\nWhat are your impressions of Baltimore over the<br />\nyears you have been here? Do you participate in any<br />\nother activities around town?<br />\nIn ten years, I think the town grew enormously, like<br />\nthe Symphony. And the identity of the town started to<br />\ngrow. Culturally. The people are more aware that we are a<br />\ncity. There is now a sense of pride in this town. The<br />\nCity Fair was a tremendous example. To see this crowd of<br />\nall the neighborhoods pulled together. It makes you<br />\nhappy. This is the future. This is America. It makes you<br />\nreally optimistic, and I'm optimistic.<br />\nI'm not an Oriole fan because I don't understand<br />\nbaseball. I was at a game once and I was very bored. My<br />\nsport was soccer which is becoming more and more<br />\npopular here. If the soccer should come here, I would be<br />\nmore involved in the sports. I like to swim, to take walks.<br />\nI like to watch athletics, but baseball, even football, are<br />\nmysteries.<br />\n<br />\nDo you ever feel you have lost identity as a<br />\nmusician?<br />\nNo, I...I sometimes feel I am losing my identity as a<br />\nnormal person. I don't have enough time to read. I don't<br />\nhave enough time to enjoy friends. To go to cinema. I'm<br />\nlosing sometimes my identity as a person, but I don't<br />\nthink I lose my identity as a musician. And I believe still,<br />\nthat the most important thing to be in life is a human<br />\nbeing. Even more to be a musician.<br />\nWhat do you see as the role of the artist in our<br />\nsociety?<br />\nThe role of the artist, or any other professional, is to<br />\nmake the life better. A doctor, an engineer, everyone. I<br />\nfeel that music is a very important part of life, and I think<br />\nthat music should become a part of everyone's life. Of<br />\ncourse I'm .doing this because I love music, but 1 think<br />\nthat if everyone loved music they would have a better<br />\nlife.I am very sincere. I feel that to be without music is to<br />\nbe color blind, or not enjoying to eat, not to make love,<br />\nnot to see a nice tree, to enjoy the sun, to go to the sea or<br />\nsee a nice mountain, to smell a flower. Life is much nicer<br />\nwith music. And I want to bring music to everyone's life.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n11\u20221111111\u2018<br />\n<br />\nSorcerer--William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist<br />\nand The French Connection, has not filmed a story<br />\nof mysticism or the supernatural, but a story of four<br />\nstrangers trapped in the filthy and primitive<br />\nbackwater of South America.

The music is indeed of this genre, but the totality of<br />\nthe album is very different. TRB is probably the only true<br />\npolitical protest band of the Seventies. It is not the<br />\nviciousness and brutality of the Music which is important<br />\nin their composition; music is secondary to the lyrics. For<br />\nit is the lyrics which set TRB apart from othert bands of its<br />\ngenre: unequivocal, they only present the situation the<br />\nway it is, exposing what's wrong and what's bad in<br />\ntoday's society. TRB sings about \"yer sister who can't get<br />\nan abortion\" or \"yer best mate getting paki-bashed, or<br />\nsent down for possessing one joint of marijuana\", but they<br />\nmake no pretense to knowing the answer. Their goal<br />\nthrough music is \"to ease even a tiny fraction of the<br />\nprejudice and intolerance in this world.\" Band leader Tom<br />\nRobinson is gay, and in the song \"Glad To Be Gay\" he<br />\ndoes not condemn, discrimination based on sexual<br />\npreference, he only expresses the problems with being<br />\ngay, and his appreciation and understanding of his sexual<br />\nstatus. Perhaps it is his disdain for folk music which made<br />\nTom Robinson become a 'punk rocker', but his songs of<br />\nprotest are as socially perceptive in the Seventies as<br />\nSB<br />\nDylan's songs were a decade ago.<br />\nI OCC<br />\n\"DEADLOCK HOLIDAY\"<br />\na<br />\nThat's<br />\nAmerica?<br />\nin<br />\nhit<br />\nQuick, what was the last reggae<br />\nto<br />\nback<br />\nway<br />\nthe<br />\nall<br />\ngo<br />\nto<br />\nhave<br />\nYou<br />\ntough one, isn't it?<br />\n1974, when Eric Clapton topped the charts with Bob<br />\nMarley's \"I Shot the Sheriff.\" Four years later, we find 10<br />\ncc goin' reggae with \"Deadlock Holiday.\" Though the<br />\nreggae purists in Jamaica may cringe at this white<br />\nexploitation of their music, the fact remains that htthis is<br />\none of the more interesting singles to hit the airwaves in a<br />\nquite some time. A smash hit in England, \"Deadlock<br />\nHoliday\" features the usual crisp production and flawless<br />\nvocals we have come to expect from Stewart and<br />\nGouldman. Whether disco-loving America will catch onto<br />\nthe Rasatafarian funkiness is another matter altogether,<br />\nSR<br />\nthough.<br />\n<br />\nEdgar Varese<br />\nYES<br />\nTORM ATO<br />\nThe only gratifying aspect of the new Yes album is that<br />\nthe record jacket, displaying photograph of the band<br />\nmembers, is splattered with tomatoes. My only response<br />\nto this album would be to bomb the band with eggs,<br />\nvegetables and other debris. The music certainly deserves<br />\nit. The rejuvenation of Yes seemed promising with Going<br />\nFor The One and the return of Rick Wakeman, but this<br />\nalbum is downright insulting to anyone's musical taste.<br />\nYes has been labeled a 'cosmic' band with precise<br />\ntechnical wizardry, but Tormato sounds like five musicians<br />\nlost ins space. There is no synthesis of the sometimes<br />\nbrilliant technical achievements of the individual band<br />\nmembers. Perhaps the main problem is Jon Anderson,<br />\nleader/songwriter/lead singer/self-proclaimed guru of<br />\n'rock' music. He not only can't write a melody, but he<br />\nwouldn't be able to sing one if he could. The music of Yes<br />\nis absolutely toneless, without melody. One can't expect<br />\nthe 'good ole days' again, but it would be nice if Yes<br />\ncould come up with more than tone-deaf music from the<br />\nSB<br />\ncosmos.<br />\n<br />\nThe Office of the Associate Dean<br />\nand The Metro Center Present<br />\n<br />\nThe New Ambaosia<br />\n50e-walk Buffet<br />\n<br />\nInternational Fellows<br />\nLecture Series<br />\n<br />\n(in the Ratbskellea)<br />\n<br />\nMENU<br />\nMoneoag,11/13 Capveo Roast Beef<br />\n(aa jas ani5 gRavy),<br />\n<br />\nWEST BERLIN:<br />\nTHE PHYSICAL,<br />\nECONOMIC and<br />\nPOLITICAL SITUATION<br />\n<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz will direct the Peabody<br />\nContemporary Music Ensemble in a free rug concert of<br />\nthe works, of Edgar Varese on Wednesday, November 15<br />\nat 8:15 p.m. in the Glass Pavilion of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity. American composer Otto Luening will serve as<br />\ncommentator for the informal program, which will<br />\ninclude Varese's Deserts, Octandre, and Poeme<br />\nElectronique. Mr. Luening is a prolific composer of<br />\norchestral works, vocal music and solo instrumental<br />\nworks, and since 1952 he has concentrated much of his<br />\nwork in the field of electronic music.<br />\nEdgar Varese was born in Paris in '1887. He studied<br />\nwith D'Indy and Roussel in the Schola Cantorum in Paris,<br />\nand with Widor at the Paris Conservatoire after winning<br />\nthe \"bourse artistique,\" a stipend from the city of Paris.<br />\nVarese organized and led the chorus of the Universite<br />\nPopulaire, and became the first conductor of the<br />\nSymphonische Chor in Berlin. He came to the United<br />\nStates in 1919 and organized the New Symphony<br />\nOrchestra, becoming active in the promotion of the Pan<br />\nAmerican Society and the International Composers Guild.<br />\nThe developments in electronic music following the<br />\nSecond World War saw a resurgence in Varese's career<br />\nprior to his death in 1965.<br />\nRegarding Deserts, which was written in 1954 for<br />\nwind instruments, percussion and interpolations of<br />\n\"organized sound,\" Varese has stated: \"The work was<br />\nconceived for two different media: instrumental sounds<br />\nand real sounds (recorded and processed) that musical<br />\ninstruments are unable to produce...I have always looked<br />\nupon the industrial world as a rich source of beautiful<br />\nsounds, an unexplored mine of music in the matrix. So I<br />\nwent to various factories in search of certain sounds that I<br />\nneeded for Deserts and recorded them.\" Henry Cowell<br />\nhasicommentated that, \"Deserts is the best work, the<br />\nmost mature, the largest and the most integrated, by a<br />\ncomposer who holds a unique position among the world's<br />\ncreators.\"<br />\nAlso scored for wind instruments is Octandre, which<br />\nwas written by Varese in 1924.

People are not machines who can be<br />\nturned on at any moment of the day or night according to<br />\nthe dictates of efficiency. Certainly, under the law the<br />\nUniversity is entitled to set whatever hours it likes for its<br />\nx,irorkers: So is the American Nazi Party legally able to<br />\nmarch in Jewish neighborhoods. Both actions are barbarous.<br />\nIt. is probably true that the head of Housekeeping has<br />\nheard few actual complaints about the change. The problem<br />\nmight be taken for the result of an innocent mistake on the<br />\npart of Mr. Zanello and company, except for the<br />\nGestapo-like: tactics that have been used to stifle all protest.<br />\nAn aura of fear pervades the custodial staff. The<br />\nNews-Letter reporter who wrote an article on the situation<br />\nwas not permitted to speak with the employees except in<br />\nthe presence of a supervisor. A flood of letters and calls hit<br />\nthe News-Letter the next day from the new night janitors<br />\nexpressing the desperate unhappiness they had feared to<br />\nreveal in the presence of superiors.<br />\nThe primary argument used to justify the new system is<br />\nthat it makes it easier to clean buildings when people are<br />\nnot using them. Some such advantage is thereby gained, to<br />\nbe sure. But morale is a terribly important facto\"r in the<br />\nperformance of any organization. Almost any worker<br />\naccomplishes a good deal more in eight hours if he is happy<br />\nthan if he is unhappy. Reason as well . as decency dictates<br />\nthat Mr. Zanello should clean up the mess he has caused by<br />\nreturning his staff to its former hours.<br /><br />\nFraternity Row<br />\nSeveral Hopkins fraternities find themselves in hot water<br /><br />\nwith their community this year. The trouble is largely of<br />\ntheir own making; people in their late teens and early<br />\ntwenties can be difficult to live with at times. The recent<br />\ndiscussions between several frats and their neighbors have<br />\nbeen productive and beneficial for both parties.<br />\nBut the criticisms leveled by some in this matter are all<br />\ntoo typical of the continual carping by many area residents<br />\nabout the University and its students. The truth is,<br />\nfraternities are among the few groups which display vigor<br />\nand youth in an otherwise rather dull, unexciting part of<br />\nthe city.<br />\nAnd it is not only because many residents in the area are<br />\nold that the community has such a superannuated social<br /><br />\nscene.

The delay<br />\nhad no dulling impact, however,<br />\non Cates Baldridge's article, \"A<br />\nPlague of Bohemian Hacks...\"<br />\nAt long last someone literate is<br />\ndaring to stand up and defy what<br />\nI call the \"meaningful\" syndrome<br />\n(i.e., \"like wow, you know, that's<br />\nreally meaningful, like you<br />\nknow.\")<br />\nHe (or is Cates a female?) went<br />\nright to the heart of the matter,<br />\npointing out the godawful<br />\nirritating truth behind the<br />\navant-garde \"writers.\" There are<br />\na good many modern poets and<br />\nwriters whose work is literature,<br />\nbut it's a long shot you'll find a<br />\nclassful of them, even if they do<br />\ncome up with the idea of reading<br />\npoetry backwards.<br />\nI'm sure the article got a<br />\nswarm of complaints from<br />\noffended proponents of the artsy<br />\nmovement. Hurray! Then again,<br />\nthe true artists might not deign<br />\nto read something as<br />\nconventional and conformist as a.<br />\nnewspaper.*<br />\nHopefully, though, the article<br />\nsent them to their meditation<br />\nworkshops and herb tea in<br />\ndisplay.<br />\nImagine, this Baldridge fellow<br />\nhad the nerve to suggest that one<br />\nought to follow grammatical<br />\nstructure and try to keep one's<br />\nwriting cohesive. Good Lord!<br />\nThe fellow wants to get a job<br />\nwhen he gets out of school! How<br />\ncrass, how commercial!<br />\nAs one who has had to put up<br />\nwith this sort of attitude from<br />\nTheatre and Film majors here at<br />\nUMBC, I'm glad someone has<br />\nfinally spoken up about this<br />\ngrowing menace on college<br />\ncampuses.

But what we write<br />\ngets put in a paper that a few<br />\nthousand people will read. What<br />\nthey write (thank God) will<br />\nrarely see publication. I guess<br />\nthat just shows the taste of<br />\nAmerican society. They just can't<br />\nappreciate true art.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nKathleen Warnock<br />\nTo the Editior:<br />\nOn October 29, the<br />\nNews-Letter printed an article<br />\nentitled, \"AN ENGLISH MAJOR<br />\nPONDERS THE QUESTION,<br />\n'WHY DID THE PRE-MED<br />\nCROSS THE ROAD?\" I was<br />\nrather annoyed by the article and<br />\nbegan a critical letter to the<br />\nEditor in reply. With the help of<br />\nsome friends, however, I came to<br />\nmy senses, realizing that the<br /><br />\narticle wasn't worth responding<br />\nto; such things are better left<br />\nalone. The crossfire between<br />\npre-meds and non-pre-meds<br />\nwhich has appeared in the Letters<br />\nto the Editor since that article--a<br />\ncross-fire which has most recently<br />\ndeteriorated into a pointless<br />\ndisplay of profanity and vicious<br />\npersonal insult--proves the latter<br />\npoint admirably.<br />\nWhy is it that we feel a need to<br />\nattack each other because of our<br />\nchosen field of study and our<br />\nprofessed aspirations? Shouldn't<br />\nwe respect each other's work?<br />\nAre we so confused about the<br />\nrole of a teaching<br />\ninstitution--due, in part, to lack<br />\nwe<br />\n\u2022of. a clear model--that<br />\nobject to another's attempts at<br />\nself-improvement?<br />\nFor some reason, we very<br />\noften fail to treat our fellow<br />\nstudents as fellow human beings.<br />\nPerhaps our little education has<br />\nbloated our egos to the point of<br />\nself-righteousness. Or is it that<br />\nthe authoritarianism of this<br />\ninstitution has so convinced us of<br />\nour inferiority that we see\u2014and<br />\ntreat--each other as inferiors?<br />\nThere is a pressing need for<br />\neach of us at Johns Hopkins<br />\n(students, faculty and<br />\nadministration members) to<br />\nperform a serious<br />\nself-examination; to find out<br />\nwhat it is in our own personal<br />\nbehaviors that has led to the<br />\nanti -social, uncooperative,<br />\ndisrespectful, and unappreciative<br />\natmosphere of this University.<br />\nOnly then can we discover what<br />\nneeds to be dote, and what must<br />\nbe done to make our lives here<br />\nmore pleasant and rewarding.<br />\nRealistically, there isn't much<br />\nhope for us. But as long as we<br />\nmaintain some ability to think, as<br />\nindependents, and to feel as<br />\nhumans, then there is some little<br />\nhope--and that might just be<br />\nenough.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOnce again, the News-Letter<br />\nhas displayed its anachronistic<br />\nmale chauvinist sensibilities as<br />\nwell as a bad taste in wine.

It<br />\nwas Flag Day, and so the theme<br />\nwas \"Flag and Country.\" The<br />\nhost of the show asked me how I<br />\nfelt about my ancestors' doings<br />\nat Fort McHenry in the year<br />\n1814. I said I was thoroughly<br />\nashamed, that the British had<br />\nindeed behaved abominably. I<br />\nthen made the mistake of adding<br />\nthat every American should, by<br />\nthe same token, be thoroughly<br />\nashamed of what this country<br />\nwas then up to in Vietnam.<br />\nThe response was electric. The<br />\nswitchboard lit up and the man<br />\nin the booth monitoring the<br />\nphone calls became quite<br />\nagitated. I was variously advised<br />\nthat I had no rights as a foreigner<br />\nto say anything (although I did<br />\ncarry a draft card in my pocket),<br />\nthat I should go back where I<br />\nbelonged (which to the<br />\nmild-mannered meant Britain but<br />\nto the more acerbic souls meant<br />\nSiberia or the fiery inferno), and<br />\nthat I was a good reason why no<br />\none should ever send his son to<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nI found all, this perplexing. I<br />\nhad been raised in that liberal<br />\nintellectual tradition in which<br />\nreasoned consistency is highly<br />\nvalued. And while I may have<br />\nbeen guilty of making a false<br />\nanalogy, I found it difficult to<br />\nexplain how Americans could<br />\ncelebrate the principles of their<br />\nown revolution with such pride<br />\nwhile they were doing their level<br />\nbest to squash every national<br />\nliberation movement in sight.<br />\nAfter that experience with<br />\nAmerican public opinion, I<br />\nretired to lick my wounds,<br />\nprotect my prospects of<br />\nacademic tenure, and collect my<br />\nthoughts. I fell to ruminating<br />\nupon the innumberable<br />\ncontradictions that pervaded<br />\nAmerican thought and practice.<br />\nI noted, for example, the<br />\nconstant stream of criticism of<br />\nthe Soviet Union for hiding<br />\nbehind the Iron Curtain and not<br />\nallowing the free flow of people<br />\nand ideas across its borders. Yet<br />\nthe U.S. State Department, until<br />\nrecently, systematically denied<br />\neven visitors' visas to anyone who<br />\nbelonged to any of the influential<br />\nCommunist parties of Western<br />\nEurope.<br />\nThen there was the infamous<br />\npromise to keep Vietnam free<br />\neven if it meant killing all the<br />\nVietnamese to do it, and an<br />\nAmerican commitment to defend<br />\nand prserve a \"free\" world which<br />\nincluded such paragons of virtue<br />\nas Generalissimo Franco in Spain,<br />\nthe generals in Brazil, Somoza in<br />\nNicaragua, the Shah of Iran, to<br />\nsay nothing of the<br />\nextraordinarily repressive regimes<br />\nin Indonesia and South Africa.<br />\nThat contradiction seemed<br />\neven more bizarre as the United<br />\nStates approached its own<br />\nBicentennial, and it is no wonder<br />\nthat Jimmy Carter had to stump<br />\nthe world preaching human rights<br />\nin order to revive American<br /><br />\ncredibility in a world grown<br />\nextremely cynical of American<br />\nintentions.<br />\nAt home, the \"Great Society\"<br />\nfell apart as it became apparent<br />\nthat social programs were least<br />\neffective where they were most<br />\nneeded and most effective where<br />\nthey were least needed. I<br />\ndiscovered that the preamble to<br />\nevery piece of Congressional<br />\nhousing legislation since 1945<br />\nasserts that every American has a<br />\nright to a decent home in a<br />\nsuitable living environment, and<br />\nwas surprised when I took a walk<br />\naround Baltimore to see the<br />\nresult. While preaching human<br />\nrights to the Russians, Jimmy<br />\nCarter appears little disposed to<br />\ndo anything about the right to<br />\ndecent housing, and seems mildly<br />\nsurprised when the blacks and<br />\nurban poor become cynical too.<br />\nAmerica, I decided, was a land<br />\nof Catch-22 , a country - to use a<br />\ncliche American journalists<br />\nfrequently apply to countries<br />\nother than their own - full of<br />\nparadoxes and contradictions.<br />\nShortly after my talk-show<br />\nexperience, I happened to read<br />\nKarl Marx. He placed great<br />\nemphasis on the \"contradictions<br />\nof capitalism,\" and that caught<br />\nmy attention. I read on,<br />\nintrigued. And the more I read,<br />\nthe more it seemed to make<br />\nsense. At the bottom of it all,<br />\nMarx argued, lies a tension<br />\nbetween capital and labor,<br />\nbetween profits and wages, which<br />\nproduces all manner of<br />\ncontradictions in the realms of<br />\neconomics, politics, social<br />\nstructures, institutions, and even<br />\nwithin thought itself.<br />\nWe could, Marx suggested,<br />\ncreate a theory to explain the<br />\ncontradictions - and the theory<br />\nwould help us to overcome them.<br />\nfound this exciting and started<br />\nto work at it-- and one by one<br />\nthe contradictions that had so<br />\nperplexed me crumbled before<br />\nthe power of the analysis.<br />\nWhen The Times of London<br />\nopined that political democracy<br />\nwas a luxury we could afford<br />\nonly if the trade unions and the<br />\nworkers showed restraint with<br />\nrespect to wage demands, I could<br />\nreadily see why they would say<br />\nthat. And it became equally easy<br />\nto understand the irate trade<br />\nunionist who wrote to The Times<br />\nto .say that political democracy<br />\nwas worthless if the price was<br />\nthat he voluntarily live in poverty<br />\nin order to keep his boss reveling<br />\nin luxury. Marx called this kind<br />\nof thing class struggle. Armed<br />\nwith that concept, I found I<br />\ncould go a long way.<br />\nBut the more successful I<br />\nbecame in unraveling the<br />\ncontradictions, the more I was<br />\nforced to accept the social<br />\nconsequences. By the time I<br />\nquoted Marx more than twice<br />\n(and not for purposes of poking<br />\nfun at him), many of my<br />\nacademic colleagues began to<br />\nregard me with suspicion. When I<br />\nsaid that perhaps Marx had<br />\nsomething sensible to contribute<br />\nto our understanding of society,<br />\nthe reaction was both outraged<br />\nand outrageous. Stories came<br />\nback to me that I had taken leave<br />\nof my senses and thrown in my<br />\nlot with what one of my most<br />\neminent colleagues described in a<br /><br />\nlearned journal as \"kooks, freaks,<br />\ndrop-outs, and malcontents.\"<br />\nI found this disconcerting<br />\nbecause I had never felt saner in<br />\nmy life. And I found it<br />\ndiscouraging because I felt I had<br />\nhold of an analysis that made<br />\nsense. What I began to discover<br />\nthrough experience was the<br />\nmeaning of \"repressive<br />\ntolerance.\" Freedom of thought<br />\nin the university is typically<br />\nconfined to certain boundaries.<br />\nWithin those boundaries you can<br />\nsay and do whatever you like;<br />\ntolerance rules there.

Stray<br />\nbeyond this fuzzy boundary and<br />\niyou are in deep trouble. I began<br />\nto experience what it means to<br />\nlive beyond the pale.<br />\nThe job offers that frequently<br />\ncrossed my desk before the<br />\npublication of my first book in<br />\nthe Marxian mold dropped off<br />\nprecipitously. Fortunately, I<br />\nobtained tenure a year before all<br />\nthat happened.<br />\nThere is a story, doubtless<br />\napocryphal, of Stalin telling<br />\nTrotsky, \"I defend to my death<br />\nyour right to say what you please<br />\nprovided you, defend to your<br />\ndeath my right to kill you for<br />\nsaying it.\" I discovered a Stalinist<br />\nstreak lurked in the breasts of<br />\nmany a supposedly liberal<br />\ncolleague. They say, in effect,\"<br />\nWe defend to our deaths the<br />\nprinciple of freedom of<br />\nintellectual inquiry provided you<br />\ndefend to your death our right to<br />\nfire you for engaging in it.\"<br />\nI first discovered that principle<br />\nwhen I happened to sit in on a<br />\nseminar given by an eminent<br />\nprofessor of sociology who gave<br />\nan account of Marx's thought<br />\nthat bore absolutely no relation<br />\nto the Marx I had studied. So I<br /><br />\nintellectual inquiry seriously and<br />\npushing it into that arena well<br />\nbeyond the boundaries of<br />\nrepressive tolerance.<br />\nThe recent furor over a<br />\nMarxist's appointment ot the<br />\nfaculty of the University of<br />\nMaryland raised similar issues.<br />\nSome fear that a Marxist would<br />\nnot be open to alternative ideas,<br />\nconveniently forgetting that most<br />\nuniversity departments have<br />\nsystematically excluded Marxists<br />\nall along.<br />\nNow, it so happens that some<br />\nMarxists probably would take<br />\nadvantage in exactly the same<br />\nway that some non-Marxists have<br />\nfor years. And there are others,<br />\nboth non-Marxists and Marxists,<br />\nwhose whole record bespeaks a<br />\ndesire for diversity.<br />\nMaryland 1State Senator John<br />\nJ. Bishop Jr. gave the real game<br />\naway in a comment on the<br />\nUnivesity of Maryland<br />\ncontroversy. This appointment,<br />\nhe said, \"is as ridiculous as .it<br />\nwould be to appoint Henry Ford<br />\nto head the political department<br />\nat Moscow Univesity.\" In my<br />\nliberal days I would have found<br />\nthat remark deeply perplexing<br />\nbecause I always thought the<br />\nUnited States was supposed to be<br /><br />\ndifferent from the Soviet Union that there was repression there<br />\nand freedom of expression here.<br />\nBut I now see that Senator<br />\nBishop was just trying to tell it<br />\nlike it really is.<br />\nOf course, things have changed<br />\nsince the bad old days of<br />\nMcCarthyism. The cruder forms_<br />\nof repression don't make sense<br />\nany more.The contradictions are<br />\ntoo obvious.<br />\nFor example, I came across the<br />\nreport of a Commission on<br />\nSubversive Activities to the<br />\nMaryland General Assembly. It<br />\nwas dated 1949 - the year the<br />\nCIA was formed - and it made<br />\ninteresting .reading. Communists<br />\nwere to be denied their political<br />\nrights because communism was a<br />\ntreasonable conspiracy, not a<br />\npolitical movement. Communists<br />\nuse fifth -column techniques.<br />\nThey operate under the direction<br />\nof a foreign power. They,<br />\ninfiltrate the labor unions,<br />\neducational organizations, and<br />\nthe media, from which positions<br />\nthey foster strikes, sabotage,<br />\npolitical murders, and racial and<br />\n\u2022 economic chaos. They infiltrate<br />\nthe armed forces, and when the<br />\nchaos is at its worst, they<br />\nforcibly overthrow the<br />\n- government, liquidate the<br />\nopposition, and abolish Political<br />\nparties. Finally, they legitimize<br />\ntheir conquest by a so-called free<br />\nelection or referendum which<br />\npurports to demonstrate popular<br />\nsupport.<br />\nNow, that sounds pretty<br />\nunpleasant to me, and I must say<br />\nI could do without it if that is<br />\n. what communism is all about. So<br />\nlet's agree that this kind of<br />\n!activity is a \"treasonable<br />\nIconspiracy\" against democracy<br />\nand that people who engage in it<br />\nshould be deprived of their<br />\npolitical rights. The trouble is<br />\nthat this was exactly what the<br />\nCIA was up to in Chile, with the<br />\napproval of Henry A. Kissinger<br />\nand Richard M. Nixon.<br />\nIn my iliberal days I would<br />\nhave expressed mild surprise that<br />\nHenry Kissinger was still at large.<br />\nBut I am older and wiser now. I<br />\nsimply recognize that it all<br />\ndepends, in the end, on whose<br />\nside you are on. And that is what<br />\nMarx meant by class struggle.<br /><br />\nMORE LETTERS TO EprroR<br />\nicont. from p.4<br />\nJohn K.

His near-victory<br />\nin the 1968 New Hampshire<br />\nDemocratic Presidential primary<br />\nwas instrumental in the decision<br />\nof President Lyndon B. Johnson<br />\nnot to seek reelection. In 1976,<br />\nhe ran as an independent in the<br />\ngeneral election. Until 1970, he<br />\nserved as a U.S. Senator from<br />\nMinnesota. Before his speech on<br />\nthe Sixties at the Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium on<br />\nNovember 1st, he spoke to the<br />\nNews-Letter about the Seventies.<br />\nN-L; Do you think that<br />\nAmerica has turned inward<br />\nduring the Seventies?<br />\nMcCirthy: I don't know what<br />\nthey mean by turning inward. As<br />\nfar as foreign policy is concerned<br />\nand turning away from other<br />\ncountries, we've practically<br />\nrejected all of our allies beginning<br />\nin the Fifties under then<br />\nSecretary of State John Foster<br />\nDulles and progressively since<br />\nthen. We've proceeded as if we<br />\ndidn't need any allies, as if it<br />\nwere just sort of a gesture. And<br />\nit's more evident now than at the<br />\nbeginning of the Fifties under<br />\nDulles, when we had this whole<br />\ndeclaration of moral superiority<br />\nfor the United States--'We're glad<br />\nto have you coming along with us<br />\nif you want to, but if you don't<br />\nwe 'lido it our way anyway.'<br />\nN-L: Well, there are some<br />\nserious problems going on<br />\noverseas, for example in South<br />\nAfrica, Iran, and the increasing<br />\nSoviet involvement, yet people at<br />\nhome don't seem to be very<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nMcCarthy: I don't know how<br />\ndeep the Soviet involvement is or<br />\nhow significant it is. We went<br />\nthrough this in the Fifties, when<br />\nthey were supposed to be gaining<br />\ngreat strength in North Africa.<br />\nDulles had a plan to try to<br />\n.establish a sort of agreement to<br />\ncontain the Communists in<br />\nNorthern Africa. Egypt was his<br />\nbig worry then. If we had this<br />\nring around Egypt, we could<br />\ncontrol Communism...I don't see<br />\nthe Russians as having any great<br />\nimpact in the long run in Africa.<br />\nThey may start a revolutionary<br />\ngovernment somewhere, but then<br />\nwhen they're done, what do they<br />\ndo with it? I think our response<br />\nshould be limited and restrained.<br />\nWe don't know much about it, in<br />\nthe first place. I think we know<br />\nas much about it as we thought<br />\nWe did about Vietnam. We didn't<br />\nknow anything about Vietnam.<br />\nN-L: One of the big issues on<br />\ncampus is divestment, but the<br />\ndemonstrations don't seem to be<br />\nall that large, not at all<br />\ncomparable to the Vietnam<br />\nprotests. Do you think we should<br />\ndivest?<br />\nMcCarthy: It's not a criticisin of<br />\nthem, but I don't think that many<br />\nstudents are really interested in<br />\nSouth Africa. But even if you<br />\nare, it's very difficult to sort it<br />\nout, to know what's the right<br />\nthing to do...We really don't<br />\nknow too much about the<br />\nrevolutionary forces...it's like<br />\nthat in Pakistan .or Iran. Three or<br />\nfour months ago, they<br />\ndemonstrated against the Shah.<br /><br />\nNow they're saying demonstrate<br />\npractically for the Shah because<br />\nhe's being attacked by the<br />\nreactionary Moslem sects. We<br />\nwent through these things after<br />\nWorld War II. We used to talk<br />\nabout Third Forces in<br />\nYugoslavia, for example...in<br />\nGreece,...and in Iran, which<br />\nweren't really there. Another<br />\nexample of not knowing what<br />\nwe're talking about is supporting<br />\nthe military junta in Greece. We<br /><br />\neven supported the more extreme<br />\none when it came in and it was so<br />\nextreme that the Greeks threw it<br />\nout. But the American policy was<br />\nto support the junta. Everyone<br />\nassumed 'You got to do this or<br />\nCommunism will take over in<br />\nGreece'...These were areas in<br />\nwhich you'd expect them to<br />\nknow more.<br />\nN-L: Has the nature of the<br />\nissues changed at all since<br />\n1 968?<br />\nMcCarthy: In the<br />\nSixties, one of the big issues was<br />\nstudent rights on campus. For<br />\nthe most part, that's taken care<br /><br />\n'We'ye practically<br />\nrejected all our<br />\nallies from the<br />\n`50's, and since<br />\nthen.......\"<br />\nof. There are still a few campuses<br />\nwhere students have protested<br />\nwith some cause, across the<br />\ncountry...these points of protest<br />\nhave been pretty well responded<br />\nto. The war in Vietnam has<br />\nended. We now have a volunteer<br />\narmy, which was not a very good<br />\nway to take the pressure off, but<br />\nthe pre\u00a7sure point would<br />\nprobably still exist had the draft<br />\ncontinued...So you don't have<br />\nany cause on campus saying,<br />\n'Well, I'm not going to be<br />\ndrafted.'<br />\nN-L: What's wrong with the all<br />\nvolunteer army?<br />\nMcCarthy: It's really a<br />\nmercenary army in the first<br />\nplace. Secondly,it's an<br />\nunrepresentative army. Thirdly,<br />\nit runs contrary to the best<br />\ntheory about the army in a<br /><br />\ndemocracy, which is that it ought<br />\nto be one that's representative of<br />\nthe people instead of one<br />\nrepresenting just minorities, and<br />\nthe poor, which is what this army<br />\nnow does...The injustice of our<br />\ncampuses has been taken care of.<br />\nNow the problem is the sort of<br />\nreverse thing. The Bakke case is a<br />\ncontrast to what the issue was in<br />\nthe Sixties of discrimination<br />\nagainst minorities...<br />\nN-L: Why is there this new<br /><br />\nN-L: Is there a new<br />\nconservatism in issues other than<br />\ntaxation?<br />\nMcCarthy: I don't know where<br />\nthey want to run the other issues.<br />\nJust to say you're going to put a<br />\nlimit on unemployment<br />\ncompensation doesn't mean that<br />\nyou've become conservative. It<br />\nmeans that the liberal position<br />\nhas been vindicated...It may also<br />\nmean simply that the liberals<br />\nhaven't been sensible or simply<br /><br />\nconservatism, with Proposition<br />\nhave realized that theie are<br />\n13 in California and Jeff Bell<br />\nproper limitations on all these<br />\nousting Clifford Case in New<br />\nprograms...<br />\nN-L: The Republicans are now<br />\nJersey?<br />\naccusing the Democrats of using<br />\nMcCarthy: Each of these are<br />\nRepublican principles.<br />\nparticular cases. I think that<br />\nProposition 13 was not<br />\nMcCarthy: You can't<br />\naltogether surprising. There are a<br />\ncopyright your platform. There's<br />\nnumber of factors that are pure<br />\nnothing that ,says the Democrats<br />\nCalifornia involved. Something<br />\nhave to pursue things that were<br />\nlike it, not Proposition 13, but<br />\nworkable and reasonable 30 years<br />\nopposition to what appears to be<br />\nago...The Republicans did that<br />\narbittary taxation on homes and<br />\nfor 50 years and that's what<br />\nreal estate. I've been surprised<br />\ninvolved them in trouble. It's a<br />\nthat protest hasn't been more<br />\nmixed case.

One, it's<br />\npretty arbitrary for a person to<br />\nhave the assessed value of his<br />\nhome go up and his taxes<br />\nincreased on it...without any sort<br />\nof representation. It sort of<br />\nsupposedly happens that because<br />\nthe property goes up, so your<br />\ntaxes go up. And set against that,<br />\nthey may be forced to sell their<br />\nhouse.And if they sell, whatever<br />\nthey gain from it, a third of it<br />\nmay be taken away in capital<br />\ndidn't...No one says Republicans<br />\ngains taxes, which would mean<br />\ncannot vote for Social Security<br />\nnow because they voted against it<br />\nthey'd have to buy a poorer<br />\nin 1936.<br />\nhouse by virtue of being forced<br />\nN-L: Then there aren't any<br />\nout of the house in which the<br />\nreal differences between the two<br />\nvalue had been increased.

Schmidt Jr.,<br />\nAssistant Professor of Psychiatry<br />\nat JHU School of Medicine and<br />\nChief of Psychiatry of Baltimore<br />\nCity hospitals gave a speech<br />\nentitled \"Adolescent Suicide in<br />\nAmerica Today.\"<br />\nSchmidt said suicide in<br />\nAmerica has always been stable,<br />\nvarying from 9-16 (successful)<br />\nsuicides per 100,000 people per<br />\nyear. Recently there have been<br />\nabout 25,000 reported suicides<br />\nper year in America. The real<br />\nfigure could be double this<br />\nbecause suicide is \"stigmatized\"<br />\nin America so many suicides are<br />\nreported as accidents. Among<br />\nadolescents aged 17 to 21 the<br />\nrate is low, about 3 or 4 suicides<br />\nper 100,000 per year, but this is<br />\n2.5 times the adolescent suicide<br />\nrate of 20 years ago. Suicide is<br />\nnow the fourth leading cause of<br />\ndeath among adolescents.<br />\n\"There is no one theory that<br />\nexplains suicide,\" Schmidt said,<br />\nbut he guesses that the increased<br /><br />\nadolescent rate is due to the<br />\nincreased use of alcohol and<br />\ndrugs among the young in the<br />\npast two decades. \"They alter<br />\none's level of consciousness, and<br />\nin an altered state of<br />\nconsciousness people will do<br />\nthings that they normally<br />\nwouldn't do.\" Drug use can make<br />\npeople emotionally unbalanced<br />\nand acts as a \"trigger mechanism<br />\nfor the suicide attempt.\"<br />\nSchmidt mentioned hoW some<br />\nsocial groups are more prone to<br />\nsuicide than others, but offered<br />\nfew explanations. Females<br />\nattempt suicide more often than<br />\nmales, but males succeed more<br />\noften (there are four times as<br />\nmany male as female successful<br />\nsuicides). Single and divorced<br />\npeople have higher suicide rates<br />\nthan married people. Whites have<br />\nhigher suicide rates than blacks.<br />\nHeavily Roman Catholic<br />\ncountries like Ireland and Spain<br />\nhave very low suicide rates(3 per<br />\n100,000) and Scandinavian<br />\ncountries have very high rates (18<br />\nto 25 per 100,000). Elderly,<br />\npeople have very high suicide '<br />\nrates because they \"lose friends<br />\nand their families and become<br />\nsocially isolated, and can't cope<br />\nwith life.\" Factors like<br />\nsocio-economic status or<br />\nunemployment are not highly<br />\ncorrelated with suicides,<br /><br />\nProductivity Not Improved<br />\nBy Night Shift Transfers<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nnight without the interference of<br />\nother people on campus is more<br />\nproductive, he said. No formal<br />\nstudy was<br />\nefficiency<br />\nimplemented, however, and while<br />\nsome employees acknowledged<br />\nthat it is easier to clean without<br />\nthe presence of students or<br />\nfaculty, others found the amount<br />\nof work they accomplished to be<br />\nthe same. \"I do eight hours of<br />\nwork, no difference if it's day or<br />\nnight\" one worker said.

The feminine<br />\nmystique preached that<br />\nmotherhood and marriage should<br />\nbe totally fulfilling for every<br />\nwoman. Those women who were<br />\ndissatisfied felt guilty without<br />\nknowing the source of their guilt<br />\nand angry because they had no<br />\noutlet in society to achieve<br />\nself-fulfillment or even to discuss<br />\ntheir problems.<br />\nFor Friedan, the movement<br />\nfirst took the form of a demand<br />\nfor equality in employment,<br />\nparticularly that the government<br />\neffectively enforce the sex<br />\ndiscrimination clause of Title<br />\nVII. The rights women sought<br />\n\"were simply the bedrock of<br />\ndemocracy -American<br />\n-participation in the mainstream<br />\nof society. Human freedom.<br />\nSelf-determination.\"<br />\nShe further observed that in<br />\nthe latter part of the 60's, the<br />\nimage of the women's movement<br />\nwas distorted through the<br />\nmisguided actions of extremists<br />\nand the anger of all women. At<br />\nthis time the media represented<br /><br />\nthe movement as being directed<br />\nagainst men.<br />\nAccording to Friedan, it was<br />\nonly after women recognized the<br />\nreal enemy without that they<br />\ncould conquer the enemy within<br />\nthemselves. The enemy without<br />\nwas \"the right-wing, John Birch<br />\npolitical factions, the church<br />\nhierarchies, who tried to make<br />\nthe women's movement seem like<br />\na fad...\" The enemy from within<br />\nwas the anger of all women at<br />\ntheir own self-denigration, anger<br />\nat the fact that their<br />\nnewly-realized political power<br />\ncould not defeat sex<br />\ndiscrimination overnight. Women<br />\nfinally began to see that the<br />\nmovement must take the<br />\ndirection not of sex or class<br />\nwarfare, but of a sex-role<br />\nrevolution.<br />\nFriedan stated that once the<br />\nERA has been ratified and<br />\nimplemented through court<br />\ndecisions, the movement can<br />\nbegin dealing with the sex-role<br />\nrevolution. Because of unequal<br />\nsex roles, relationships between<br />\nmen and women have become<br />\ndistorted. Women should be able<br />\nto cultivate those human<br />\nqualities socially defined as<br />\n\"masculine,\" such as strength<br />\n-and the realistic ability to seek<br />\nfulfillment through a career.<br /><br />\nPresident George Connolly and<br />\nstudent members of the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies had advocated the<br />\nsingle-committee proposal.

A member of the<br />\nPaulist Fathers, an American<br />\nRoman Catholic religous order<br />\ndedicated to explaining the<br />\nfundamental truths of the<br />\nCatholic Faith and to the<br />\nunderstanding and service of<br />\nnon- Catholics, Rev. Donahue<br />\nhas a varied and intensely<br />\ninteresting background.<br />\nIn June, 1942, he enlisted in<br />\nthe U.S. Army Tank Corps and<br />\nduring World War Two Father<br />\nDonahue participated in military<br />\ncampaigns in Northern France,<br />\nthe Rhineland, Ardennes, and<br />\ncentral Europe. He was wounded<br />\nin action three times and suffered<br />\nthe loss of his right eye in March<br />\nof 1945 in Marburg, Germany<br />\ndue to the shelling of enemy<br />\nbazooka fire. Subsequently, he<br />\nwas promoted to the rank of<br />\nFirst Lieutenant.<br />\nAfter having attended the<br />\nSchool of Foreign Service -of<br />\nGeorgetown University, Rev.<br />\nDonahue decided to enter the<br />\nPaulist minor seminary in<br />\nBaltimore. Eight years later, he<br />\nwas ordained a priest at the<br />\nChurch of St. Paul the Apostle in<br />\nNew York City.<br />\nFather Donahue's first Paulist<br />\nassignment was as Chaplain at<br />\nMemphis State University and<br />\nthe University of Tennessee<br />\nMedical School in Memphis. In<br />\nAugust of 1965 he travelled to<br />\nJohannesburg, South Africa,<br />\nwhere he initially served as<br />\nAssistant Pastor at the Church of<br />\nthe 'Blessed, Sacrament. He was<br />\nforced to leave the country after<br />\ntwo years when the government<br />\nrefused to renew his visa due to<br />\nthe Church's stand against<br />\napartheid. Before coming to<br />\nHopkins, Father Donahue was<br />\nthe Catholic Chaplain at Tufts<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nRecently, Father Donahue was<br />\nquestioned by the News-Letter<br />\non his new duties and<br />\nresponsibilities at Hopkins, his<br />\nperspective on how students and<br />\ntheir attitudes have changed in<br />\nthe last two decades, and his<br />\nviews on the Catholic Church and<br />\nits future with the ascension of<br />\nJohn Paul II to the papal throne.<br />\nHe was interviewed by Roger<br />\nBlumenthal.<br />\nWhat is your function on the<br />\nJohns Hopkins campus and your<br />\nrelationship to the Chaplain's<br />\noffice?<br />\nThere is no official connection<br />\nbut a good relationship exists.<br />\nSince 1927 we have had a<br />\ncooperative arrangement with the<br />\nuniversity which is the same for<br />\nall religious groups, except for<br />\nthe Office of the Chaplain, which<br />\nis the established' coordinating<br />\noffice.<br />\nDo .you conduct Sunday mass<br />\nat Johns Hopkins?<br />\nYes, I am the campus pastor<br />\nfor the Catholic community at<br />\nHopkins. Mass will beheld at the<br />\nGlass Pavilion on Sundays at<br />\n10:00 A.M. Previously it was<br />\nheld at Shaffer Hall.<br />\nWe also celebrate mass on<br /><br />\ncampus Monday, Wednesday, and<br />\nFriday at 8:00 A.M. in the<br />\nconference room. During the<br />\nCatholic holy days mass will be<br />\nheld on campus just like a normal<br />\nCatholic parish. The one big<br />\nexception is midnight mass at<br />\nChristmas eve since no one is on<br />\nthe campus.<br />\nWhat other activities will you<br />\nsponsor for the Catholic students<br />\nand faculty?<br />\nPrayer groups and seminars<br />\nabout the Catholic faith will be<br />\norganized. On some occasions<br />\nspeakers will be invited to<br />\naddress the community.<br />\nI am also available for spiritual<br />\ncounseling on a twenty-four hour<br />\nbasis. The last statistics that we<br />\nhave show that 25% of the<br />\nstudent body at Johns Hopkins is<br />\nRoman Catholic.<br />\nHave the students been<br />\nparticipating actively in your<br />\nprograms?<br />\nAbout one hundered and<br />\nninety people usually attend<br />\nmass. This includes faculty, staff<br />\npeople and a nice group of<br />\nstudents.<br />\nI am also campus minister for<br />\nthe students at the medical<br />\nschool. Therefore, students from<br />\nthe downtoWn campus also<br />\nattend services. More Roman<br />\nCatholics have been participating<br />\nin worship services on campus<br />\nthan in the last ten years.<br />\nHow do you think students<br />\nhave changed in recent years in<br />\ngoals and moral values?<br />\nStudents are definitely more<br />\ncareer oriented. At a superior<br />\nacademic school like Johns<br />\nHopkins, they have become<br />\npre -professional students.<br />\nPractically everyone is preparing<br />\nfor a professional school.<br />\nespecially medicine and law. We<br />\nwish that more were entering the<br />\nfield of theology but there are<br />\nsome.<br />\nIt is fair to say that students<br />\nare digging deeper in their books<br />\nand spending more time studying<br />\nthan those of six years ago. Johns<br />\nHopkins' undergraduate campus<br />\nis just one big pressure cooker!<br />\nWe are beginning to wonder if<br />\nstudies are getting in the way of<br />\nan education. In a place like<br />\nOxford, students and professors<br />\ngather sometimes to discuss<br />\ngeneral topics without concern<br />\nfor grades.<br />\nHow do you account for this<br />\nchange in students?<br />\nThe pressures of grades to get<br />\ninto graduate school. Students<br />\nmust obtain high grades to get<br />\ninto graduate school in order to<br />\nenter their chosen profession.<br />\nBecause of this, general cultural<br />\ninterests must go by the wayside.<br />\nMany times students are not<br />\nexploring outside of their field in<br />\na voluntary nature. Less students<br />\nare participating in extra<br />\ncurricular activities than four<br />\nyears ago. Emphasis on studies at<br />\nJohns Hopkins is very intense.<br />\nThe one exception in the<br />\nCatholic community is mass<br />\nattendance which has been very<br />\ngood.<br />\nDo you think that Johns<br />\nHopkins is diffirent from other<br />\nuniversities that you have been<br />\nassociated with?<br />\nTufts where I served last is a<br />\nvery fine school but at Hopkins<br /><br />\nthere are many more people In<br />\nthe hard sciences. It is probably<br />\nmore intense at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nOne does not find this intensity<br />\nin engineering schools nor in<br />\nsociology departments.<br />\nDo you think that this<br />\nintensity causes emotinoal<br />\nproblems?<br />\nIn counseling, I am asked<br />\nquestions like \"What can I do<br />\nwith my life? I may not make it to<br />\nmedical school. What do I do<br />\nnow?\" I try to show students that<br />\nthere are other things to do with<br />\none's life. I would love to see the<br />\nday when medical schools would<br />\nbe begging for students! A fine<br />\nstudent can regear himself to<br />\nlook another another avenue.<br />\nIt would be best if some<br />\nstudents did not come to a<br />\nschool like Hopkins. Straight A<br />\nstudents from high school are<br />\ncompeting against each other. If<br />\nthey had gone to a state school,<br />\nthey would have done very well<br />\nand probably been able to enter a<br /><br />\nanother assignment and get it<br />\nright away. I have been offered<br />\nmany other assignments before<br />\naccepting Hopkins.<br />\nWhat made you decide to<br />\ncome to Hopkins?<br />\nAfter six years at Tufts the<br />\nlikelihood that I should move is<br />\nrather strong. Assignments are<br />\nusually for a period of four years.<br />\nAmong the Paulist Fathers,<br />\nHopkins is considered a very<br />\ninteresting assignment. The<br />\nstudents respond to the ministry<br />\nand the priest.<br />\nI am also living closer to my<br />\nfamily for the first time. They<br />\nare in Philadelphia and Atlantic<br />\nCity. At my age one likes to see<br />\none's family more frequently.<br />\nHave you had any interesting<br />\nexperiences with Alie students<br />\nthat you would likes to share with<br />\nthe Hopkins community?<br />\nMy main efforts these past six<br />\nweeks have been to get around<br />\nand meet people. I had a fine<br />\ncourtesy call with President<br /><br />\nstate medical school.<br />\nHow do you compare your<br />\nposition at Hopkins with one at a<br />\nchurch in terms of your own<br />\npersonal satisfaction?<br />\nI like being around<br />\nuniversities. It offers a challenge<br />\nbecause of the \"get up and goof the students. I am one of the<br />\nlast in the priesthood of what we<br />\ncall \"general practioners.\" I have<br />\nto make an effort to relate to<br />\npeople in many academic fields.<br />\nWhen you are around young<br />\npeople, things are, usually very<br />\nhappy.<br />\n.<br />\nIn the university I am almost<br />\ntotally cut off from the problems<br />\nof married people. There are not<br />\nmany married students anymore.<br />\nI rarely officiate at a funeral in a<br />\nuniversity community where as<br />\nin a normal parish, I would be<br />\ncalled on to do it several times a<br />\nweek. I like to work at<br />\nuniversities, and I get up in the<br />\nmorning looking forward to the<br />\nday. At my level in the<br />\npriesthood, I could request<br /><br />\nMuller. I am a sailor and one of<br />\nthese days, I am going to get my<br />\nboat in the water and share some<br />\nexperiences with the students.<br />\nWhat is your reaction to a<br />\nselection of a non-Italian pope?<br />\nWere you surprised at all?<br />\nA very pleasant surprise. He is<br />\na former university chaplain!<br />\nDo you think that there will<br />\nbe any major changes in the<br />\nchurch?<br />\nIt is too early to say. I do not<br />\nsee much prospect of major<br />\nchange in church life. On the<br />\nworld scene it is a form of polite<br />\ncollaboration with. Communist<br />\ncountries.<br />\nIs the decline in the number of<br />\nmen entering the priesthood a<br />\nserious problem in your opinion?<br />\nIt is very serious. Though there<br />\nis a shortage, there are definitely<br />\nmore men entering our<br />\nseminaries. It is better now than<br />\na few years ago.<br />\nHave you noticed a change- in<br />\nthe moral standards of young<br />\nCatholics .specifically beyond<br /><br />\nadolescence?<br />\nYoung Catholics are like<br />\nyoung people in general. We wenti<br />\nthrough a period in the 60's of<br />\nthe most intense questioning of<br />\nany authority. Yes, there is an<br />\nincrease in questioning of<br />\nreligion, but also an increase in<br />\nthe practicing of the faith.<br />\nCatholics are more concerned<br />\nabout justice, racism and<br />\nanti-semitism than ever before.<br />\nDo you forsee the removal of<br />\nthe sanction against birth control?<br />\nNo, I do not. The Church<br />\nteaches that if you have four or<br />\nfive children, you do the best<br />\nthat you can. However, church<br />\nmoney is going into research of<br />\nhuman reproduction especially<br />\nthe time when conception will<br />\ntake place.<br />\nOne thing in Catholic teaching<br />\ntoday is do everything to build<br />\nup the family. We want better<br />\nquality and stronger families.<br />\nYoung people of the future are<br />\ngoing to be asked to go through<br />\nmore formal preparation for<br />\nmarriage than they have in the<br />\npast.<br />\nDo you feel that the church's<br />\nguide lines on birth control are<br />\nalienating any young Catholics?<br />\nUnfortunately, I do. On the<br />\nother hand, I believe that if the<br />\nyoung Catholics in question<br />\nwould take the time for more<br />\nextended study, they would be<br />\nless alienated. Maybe not fully<br />\nturned around, but not alienated.<br />\nAs a priest who hears the<br />\nconfessions of many, many<br />\nCatholics, I do not feel that one's<br />\nbelief on birth control is any<br />\nreason to leave the Catholic<br />\nchurch. I am very discouraged<br />\nbecause so many people put it on<br />\nthe par with many great<br />\nteachings of the church, and it is<br />\nnot! It certainly does affect<br />\nevery family but it is not on the<br />\npar with the great teachings. In<br />\nthe hierarchy of values, justice<br />\nand treating one's fellowman<br />\nwith some regard for personal<br />\ndignity is much more important.<br />\nI personally feel that the<br />\nscientific world will help us to<br />\nthis problem of<br />\novercome<br />\ndetermining when the possibliity<br />\nof conception will take place<br />\nmore precisely. This is a question<br />\nclearly in the hands of the .<br />\nmedical community. The church<br />\nis not against birth control but<br />\nagainst birth control by artificial<br />\nmeans. The pill is only about<br />\ntwenty-two years old and we<br />\nhave no long range data on it. We<br />\ndo not know how it is going to<br />\nbe affecting women who have<br />\nbeen on it for twenty years.<br />\nIs there anything that you<br />\nwould like to say to the students<br />\nthat you would not ordinarily<br />\ncome in contact with such as<br />\nstudents of other religious<br />\ndenominations?<br />\nAs a priest I am working in<br />\nclose connection with the Office<br />\nof the Chaplain. I would like<br />\neveryone to know that I am<br />\navailable to discuss any problems<br />\nthat they may have. I am willing<br />\nto be a resource person for<br />\npapers concerning the Catholic<br />\nreligion. For any person who<br />\nwants to talk to a priest for any<br />\nreason at all, I have a twenty-four<br />\nhour availability.

But crouching uncomfortably<br />\nat the bottom of this conglomeration of academia , nuts,<br />\nthe low man on this motley totem pole, is the commuter.<br />\nEvery student at Hopkins has his problems. Everyone<br />\nsuffers the pangs and pains inherent in devoting four years<br />\nof his youthful prime to reading, writing papers and<br />\nstudying for exams into the wee hours of the morn. But<br />\nthere is the relief provided by a<br />\nfor most students<br />\nfeeling of camaraderie and community. The average<br />\nundergrad can retreat to his apartment and wallow in the<br />\nwarm companionship of his jolly roommates. The<br />\ncommuter, on the other hand, shuffles disconsolately to<br />\nhis '68 Mustang, hops on the surging smoggy roller coaster<br />\nknown as Baltimore rush hour traffic, and gets home just<br />\nin time to catch the last few rounds of his parents' latest<br />\nbout. However, he does share a small but cozy 8' by 11'<br />\ncubby hole with his little brother and a half-dozen Kiss<br />\nposters.<br />\nThe theme of commuter life is alienation. Commuters<br />\nare out-numbered on this campus by about 9 to 1. Even<br />\nGeneral Custer had better odds than those. I got a brief<br />\nbut potent glimpse of what I was getting myself into<br />\nwhen I joined my classmates for freshmen orientation two<br />\nyears ago. A fellow commuter and I arrived for the first of<br />\nthe Orientation activities, walking uncertainly towards the<br />\nfreshmen quad where the \"dormies\" (as we scornfully<br />\nlabeled them) were lugging trunks, settling into rooms and<br />\nintroducing themselves to one another. Smiles and<br />\nlaughter abounded and frisbees were already on the wing.<br />\nMy friend and I stood and watched as if behind a pane of<br />\nglass. Before long, an upperclassman with a clipboard<br />\napproached us and inquired, \"You guys commuters?\" We<br />\nnodded timidly. How pitiful we must have appeared that<br />\nhe could spot us so easily! \"Okay, then follow me,\" he<br />\nsaid, turning his back on us and strutting away. We<br />\nwalked close behind, happy and relieved that someone,<br />\nhowever curt, had acknowledged our presence. Our guide<br />\nled us into the New Dorm Building, through a hallway<br />\nand some swinging doors, into the Snack Bar and out a<br />\nback exit. \"Okay, this is it,\" he told us. We were now<br />\nstanding at the back of the dorm,surrounded on one side<br />\nby a trash dumpster, and on the other side by a huddled<br />\nmass of mum commuters. The scene suggested Exercise<br />\nHour at the state pen.<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nCommuters often<br /><br />\nI looked around, wondering why it was necessary to<br />\ncorral the commuters to the back of the building, away<br />\nfrom the other freshmen. Were we carriers of some<br />\nstrange disease, some gruesome infectious malady that<br />\ncould cripple or blind the rest of the class should we come<br />\nin contact with them? I felt like asking, but I already felt<br />\nfoolish enough. The clipboard man gave a short speech<br />\nwelcoming \"you commuters\" to Hopkins, and he<br />\n\"hoped\" that our four years at JHU would be \"fun.\" For<br />\nsome reason, at that moment, as the pungent scent of the<br />\ntrash dumpster wafted under my nostrils, I envisioned the<br />\nnext four years as anything but fun. Before being<br />\ndismissed, each of us was handed a piece of paper listing<br />\nthe next few days' events, one of which was a meeting<br />\nwith President Muller at his house later that afternoon.<br /><br />\nMy introduction to the President sticks in my mind,<br />\nnot just because I was awed by his sunny complexion, but<br />\nalso because of his reaction when I told him I was a<br />\ncommuter. I stood in his den with three other freshmen<br />\n(all dormies, in fact). He chatted amiably with the other<br />\nthree about their hometowns and majors. It turned out he<br />\nwent to college with the father of one of them. Finally,<br />\nhe shook my hand and asked where I was from.<br />\n\"Baltimore,\" I answered. \"I'm a commuter.\"<br />\nInstantaneously (and I know it wasn't my imagination),<br />\nhis grip loosened and he appeared at a loss for words. He<br />\nsimply nodded his bronzed head, and the only ming this<br />\nworldly erudite man could manage to say was, \"So.<br />\nYou're a commuter, huh?\" Before I could reply, he said<br />\nto the four of us while sweeping a hand towards the door,<br />\n\"Well, it was nice meeting you all. Drop by again<br />\nsometime.\"<br />\nI'm told that a Hopkins undergrad, during his four-yelr<br /><br />\nout on many student activities, such as the Young Republicans'biannual taffy pull.<br /><br />\nstay here, meets President Muller two times; once during<br />\nfreshmen orientation, the second time at graduation.<br />\nWhen my time comes to step up onto the stage and<br />\nreceive my sheepskin and handshake from the President,<br />\nI'm going to say to him,\"In answer to your question: no,<br />\nactually, I used to be a commuter, but I'm not anymore.\"<br />\nI'm sure he won't have the foggiest idea what the hell I'm<br />\ntalking about.<br />\nNE THING<br />\nI LEARNED in two years of<br />\nat<br />\nFrench<br />\nHopkins (perhaps the one thing) was<br />\nthe French word for commuter: externe. It<br />\nconnotes alienation the way a \"Condemned\" sign<br />\nbespeaks ruin. The French tape from which I learned the<br />\nword detailed the trials and tribulations of a Parisian<br /><br />\nuniversity commuter. He is confused, lost, disorienti By<br />\nthe end of the tape, I really felt for the poor guy, like few<br />\nother people could. A classmate of his, a dormie no<br />\ndoubt, mocks him mercilessly. \"Vous etes exteme?<br />\nHahahahahahaha! C'est tris amusante!\"That derisive peal<br />\nof Gallic laughter riddled my heart like, bullets. To this<br />\nday, whenever I hear a Frenchman laugh, my fists clench<br />\nand my blood starts to boil.<br />\nI'm often asked,\"Why do commuters come to Hopkins<br />\n- in the first place? Didn't they want to go away to<br />\ncollege?\" You better believe most of us wanted to go<br />\naway. In fact, I still do (to Oahu if I could, but that's<br />\nanother story). The reason commuters come to Hopkins<br />\nin the first place (when it's often the third place they had<br />\nin mind) is money, or rather, the lack thereof. I remember<br />\nApril of my senior year in high school; I was bargaining<br />\nover the phone,long distance, with the college of my first<br />\nchoice, begging for additional financial aid. If I couldn't<br />\nwangle more bread out of this school, then I'd have to go<br />\nto Hopkins, and commute!<br />\nI sobbed into the<br />\n\"Please gimme more money!\"<br />\nmouthpiece as tears of panic rolled hotly down my face.<br />\nThe distant minute voice of the financial aid lady said.<br />\n\"You mentioned that you have a backup school that<br />\noffered you enough aid, right?\"<br />\n\"Yes,\" I sniffed.<br />\n\"Well, what school is that?' she asked.<br />\n\"Johns Hopkins.\"<br />\n\"Well, that's a good school, too.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, but I wanna go to your school!\"<br />\n\"I'd like to lielp,young man, but we just don't have any<br />\nmore money to give out. I'm very sorry.\"<br />\nA tad upset, I hung up, and pretty hard too, because I<br />\nripped the phone off the wall.For the first time, I resolved<br />\nmyself to the fact that I would be attending Hopkins that<br />\nE nlike many commuters, I never developed a sense of<br />\nfalU<br />\nreverence towards Hopkins while I was growing up. The<br />\ncommon commuter will tell you stories of how, as a<br />\nyoung tot, he heard great things about JHU. He'll tell you<br />\nabout the feeling of respect and admiration that overcame<br />\nhim whenever his family drove up Charles Street and past<br />\nthe University on their way home from church. I too grew<br />\nup seeing and hearing a lot of this legendary college, but I<br />\nhad a slightly different conception of the place than most<br /><br />\nCo<br /><br />\nring<br />\nion.<br />\nand<br />\nlent,<br />\nno,<br />\n)re.\"<br />\nI'm<br />\nvo.<br /><br />\ns of<br />\nwas<br />\nIt<br />\nsign<br />\nthe<br />\ntsian<br /><br />\n'By<br />\nfew<br />\nno<br />\nwe?<br />\npeal<br />\nthis<br />\nnch<br /><br />\nkins<br />\nto<br />\ngo<br />\nlat's<br />\nkins<br />\nhad<br />\niber<br />\niing<br />\nfirst<br />\ncm 't<br />\n)go<br />\nthe<br />\nace.<br />\naid,<br />\nthat<br /><br />\nany<br />\nise I<br />\nlved<br />\nthat<br />\n! of<br />\nThe<br />\nis a<br />\nyou<br />\nime<br />\n)ast<br />\nrew<br />\nut I<br />\nlost<br /><br />\nkids.

I was too<br />\nyoung to realize how close these primordial impressions<br />\ncame to the truth.<br />\nE COMMUTERS HAVE A SAYING: \"Show<br />\nme the most pathetic, lonesome-looking<br />\ncreature on campus, and I'll show you a<br />\ncommuter.\" It's not very hard to spot one. You<br />\nmight want to try this interesting little experiment<br />\nsometime, just to discover how easy it is to pick a<br />\ncommuter out of the madding crowd. During any school<br />\nday at about 10:50 A M., sit on one of the benches<br /><br />\noutside of Levering Hall and watch the students walk to<br />\nand from their classes. Usually, a group of four or five<br />\npeople will amble by, cackling like hens on their way to a<br />\nfeeding. Occasionally, a lone student will straggle past, a<br />\nbulging knapsack on his back, the ubiquitous brown<br />\nlunchbag in his hand, and his eyes cast downward. If you<br />\ncould get a good look at his face, you'd find \"commuter\"<br />\nwritten all over it.<br />\nI have difficulty trying to imagine a more heart-rending<br />\nsight than that of the commuter sitting cross-legged and<br />\nalone in the middle of a quad, and eating a peanut<br />\nbutter and jelly sandwich or leftover chicken from a<br />\nbrown paper bag. Sometimes he will scatter bits of cake<br />\nor a few drumstick bones in hope that a passing pigeon or<br />\nsquirrel will stop and join him in his solitary repast. If<br />\nanyone can find a more pitiful picture, I'd like him to<br />\nshow it to me.<br />\nThe brown paper bag alone is enough to arouse shame<br />\nand embarrassment in any commuter. A week ago I<br />\narrived for my History of the French Revolution class and<br />\ntook a seat next to a non-commuter acquaintance of<br />\nmine. He leaned over and hissed in my ear, \"I suppose<br />\nthis class by<br />\nyou realize how you degrade everyone in<br />\nHe picked<br />\nday.\"<br />\nevery<br />\nbringing in that stupid lunch bag<br />\nface.<br />\nGrease<br />\nmy<br />\nin<br />\nsly<br />\ncontemptuou<br />\nup the bag and held it<br />\nwere<br />\ncookies<br />\noatmeal<br />\nhomemade<br />\nstains from my mother's<br />\n\"You<br />\nshould<br />\npaper.<br />\nbrown<br />\nthe<br />\nover<br />\nall<br />\nslowly spreading<br />\ncontinued. \"It makes us<br />\nbe ashamed,\" my acquaintance<br />\nI hung my head<br />\nfeel like we're back in fifth grade again.\"<br />\nme. \"I'll bet<br />\nberated<br />\nhe<br />\nStill<br />\nand muttered an apology.<br />\nand one of<br />\nhere,<br />\nin<br />\negg<br />\nhard-boiled<br />\nyou've even got a<br />\non the<br />\nsplotches<br />\nblack<br />\nwith<br />\nbananas<br />\nthose short ugly<br />\nskin!\"<br />\nnightmare.

It's<br />\nbad enough living in Dundalk or Timonium, but having to<br />\nresort to the Maryland Transit Authority for your daily<br />\nconveyance is adding insult to injury.<br />\nMore and more these days I've been having trouble<br />\nwith my car (a '49 Hudson which once belonged to<br />\nAverill Harriman's barber). On those mornings when the<br />\ncar refuses to budge, I catch the bus. About a month ago,<br />\nI boarded the number 11 and sat next to an old man who<br />\nimmediately began recounting the history of his gall<br />\nbladder. He showed me the scar from his prostrate<br /><br />\noperation, and then he took out his teeth. I got off the<br />\nbus, about four miles from my stop, and started walking.<br />\nI could have hitch-hiked but I swore off that mode of<br />\ntransportation a few years ago when it became obvious<br />\nthat the only people who would pick me up were<br />\nhomosexuals and Moonies.<br />\nContending with the campus police is another hassle<br />\nthat befalls the commuter alone. To resident students, the<br />\n\"campus clowns\" serve merely as a source of humor,<br />\nwhile the commuter must beware parking tickets and the,<br />\noccasional kidnapping of his car. Signs all over Hopkins<br />\nparking lots ominously announce, \"Unless your car has a<br />\nparking sticker, it will be towed to Greenwood's Garage<br />\non North Avenue.\" I have awful visions of this<br />\nGreenwood's Garage, of masked men clad in black,<br />\nchuckling viciously as they stick the burning ends of<br />\ncigarettes against my car, and then calling me in in the<br />\nmiddle of the night, telling me where to drop off the<br /><br />\nransom in case I ever want to see my car again.<br />\nWhat I resent of the resident student the most is that<br />\ntwo or three times a year he returns to New Jersey or<br />\nLong Island for a hero's welcome. His family sees him so<br />\ninfrequently that when he does go home, he receives the<br />\nroyal treatment: little sister waiting on him hand and<br />\nfoot, old buddies coming around to visit, Dad treating<br />\neveryone to a big spread at a fancy restaurant. The<br />\ncommuter goes home every day, but his reception is,<br />\n\"Here comes the geek, tracking leaves on my new carpet<br />\nagain!\" These are the rare occasions on which I actually<br />\nwish I lived in New Jersey.<br />\nAs I stated before, sometimes this jealousy of the<br />\nresident student blossoms into full-fledged, one-hundred<br />\nproof hatred. One commuter friend of mine (who, I<br />\nadmit, is wrapped none too tightly) has told me of a<br />\ncertain scheme he is devising. He plans to drive his car up<br />\nthe service lane in front of the Library (all the time<br />\n\"putting the pedal to the metal,\" as we say), hang a left<br />\nonto Gilman Quad, and run over any resident students he<br />\nhappens to see. \"And if they duck inside buildings,\" he'<br />\nwhispers diabolically, \"I'll go right in after 'em, car and<br />\nall. Great idea, huh?\"<br />\nHE<br />\ni UNIVERSITY is currently<br />\nconstructing a brick wall at the school's back<br />\nentrance off Wyman Park Drive. Every day<br />\nwhen I pull out of the Garland Hall parking lot<br />\n(designated as Lot P on the little campus map that<br />\ncommuters receive every year), I look up and watch the<br />\ngateway of this brick wall shrink in my rear-view mirror as<br />\nI drive away. The money being used to build this wall (a<br />\nwall I am gradually coming to detest) should be spent on<br />\na commuter monument. This monument could be<br />\nmodeled on the Statue of Liberty: a commuter, sculpted<br />\nin pewter, standing on a pedestal, his left arm clutching a<br />\nknapsack to his heart, his right arm raised high, holding<br />\naloft a grease-stained brown paper lunch bag. The<br />\ninscription on the base of the monoment should be simple<br />\nbut stirring, something like,\"Give me your tired, your<br />\npoor:your commuters yearning to breathe free...\"<br />\nOne final thought: I'm sitting here trying to figure out<br />\nhow many miles I will have driven in four years of<br />\ncommuting to Hopkins. I live five miles from school, so<br />\nthat's ten miles a day. Fifty miles a week, two hundred<br />\nmiles a month (and this doesn't include driving down for<br />\nextra-curriculars and social events). That's 1800 miles a<br />\nyear, so in four years I will have. driven 7200 miles! Yet,<br />\nI'll have never gotten more than five miles away from my<br />\nfront door. Somehow it seems a tremendous waste of<br />\ntime and fossil fuel. 7200 miles! I could have made it to<br />\nOahu easy, with a few extra miles to spare.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nII<br />\ncampus cop puts the screws to another commuter.<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I NOVEMBER 10, 1978<br /><br />\nPraise The $34 *?$!(/<br />\n1<br />\n4P$ Lord!<br />\nBY MARC NASDOR<br />\n\"Healed!\" Thaesiwhat he said. \"Thou deaf and dumb<br />\nspirits, come...OUT!\" With a wild motion like a moth<br />\ntaking flight, he yanked his thumbs simultaneously from<br />\nthe ears of the little deaf Or!. The mother, blissful tears<br />\nstreaming from her eyes, held tightly onto her daughter's<br />\nshoulders. The plump man with the kind face, his head<br />\ncovered with more Vitalis than hair, crossed over to the<br />\nside of the child. He clapped his hands twice.<br />\n\"Baby?\" No response. He moved his mouth to within<br />\nthree inches of her ear. \"Jesus!\" Nothing. His eyes shifted<br />\nfrom side to side, from the audience to the television<br />\ncameras.

Five<br />\nmore people and then I would have my chance to have<br />\nmy head slapped and diseases (I told them I had nervous<br />\nfits and asthma) healed by the great Ernest Angley, lord<br />\nof the television evangelists. Five thousand of the poorest,<br />\n--sleaziest scums of the earth had packed themselves into<br />\nthe Towson Center on the campus of Towson State<br />\nUniversity. It was a multi-million-dollar operation. The<br />\nstage was beautifully decorated with at least a ton of fresh<br />\nflowers, and a luscious blue velvet curtain hung<br />\nsensuously around the back and the sides. Three very<br />\nexpensive-looking cameras (as nice as those used by the<br />\nnetworks) were positioned in an equilateral triangle; two<br />\non 'either side of the stage and one in the middle of the<br />\naudience. My heart was pounding and my groin twitching.<br />\nAll of this and much more happened three Sundays<br />\nago, October 22, but the story goes back much farther.<br />\nDuring the summer, a close acquaintance, call him John, a<br />\njunior at Northwestern University and fellow sleazeball,<br />\nturned me on to this legendary apostle of the syndicated<br />\nairwaves. Since then, I have been turning others on to the<br />\nshow, and am planning to start up a subversive Ernest<br />\nAngley cult right here at Hopkins. Watching the show, or<br />\nministry as Ernie would say, most intelligent amoebae go<br />\ninto fits of laughter. It beats NBC's Saturday Night Live<br />\nby a longshot. On the.other hand, being in the presence of<br />\nthisimadness is a different thing altogether. Nausea, fear,<br /><br />\n.and sadness were the only emotions coming out of me<br />\nthat afternoon at the Towson Center.<br />\nThe live show is divided into three parts and an<br />\nintroduction. The first and third parts are televised; the<br />\nmiddle, which is the fundraising hour, is not. Dozens of.<br />\npeople were hired to keep things (the audience) in order.<br />\nThe introduction consisted of a plastic-faced,<br />\npolyester-suited man who came out on stage to warm up<br />\nthe audience in a manner reminiscent of the days of Truth<br />\nor Consequences, finishing off with--\"And now, ladies<br />\nand gentlemen, here's your evangelist and mine...Ernest<br />\nAngley!\" The crowd roared. Then out stepped the Boss,<br />\nin all his Caucasian glory. I only wish there was enough<br />\nspace in this newspaper for a transcription of the entire<br />\nshow; it would have sent the Pope into a cold sweat. One<br />\nthing was obvious, this man was a master at hypnotism.<br />\nFor over three hours, with the help of his goons and<br /><br />\ncronies, he had them in the palms of his hands. The<br />\nretarded, deformed, crippled--all of them--were held in his<br />\ntrance while he spewed out his demonic spiel. It was<br />\nAll-American, All-God, and most importantly, All-Ernest<br />\nAngley. At one point he complained that the Baltimore<br />\nSunpapers' had refused to allow him to place his<br />\nadvertisement announcing the ministry in the paper; then<br />\nhe commanded every one of them, I should say us, to<br />\nwrite letters to the Editor, even to call the Editor up<br />\npersonally. The audience responded with an ear-splitting<br />\n\"HALLELUJAH!\"<br />\nPart two was the fundraising, cameras off, which lasted<br />\nmore than an hour. This was what made me sick to my<br />\nstomach. As Ernest preached, at least a dozen ushers<br />\ncombed the aisles for contributions, BIG contributions. A<br />\nwhite, gallon-sized bucket was passed down my row. As I<br />\nzipped it by, I looked inside and saw more cash than I<br />\nhave ever seen in my -life, with the exception of my<br /><br />\nelementary school tour of the Bureau of Engraving and<br />\nPrinting. I was tempted to grab a* handful, but luckily I<br />\nturned around to see the six-foot-four, two hundred fifty<br />\npound goon staring right at me. I quickly passed the<br />\nbucket. At a designated time Ernest announced that the<br />\nministry would be ever so appreciative if everyone would<br />\nbe so kind as to hold up a crisp one-dollar bill, so that<br />\nthey could pay for renting the hall. \"It would be like an<br />\nact of love,\" he said, \"your covenant with Gawd!\"Like<br />\nautumn leaves, the George Washingtons were held up in<br />\nthe air for the ushers to gracefully pluck from their hands.<br />\nOne has to see this to believe it; the poorest of the poor<br />\ngiving, literally, their life savings away.<br />\nFinally, part three, the healing. I was wearing a<br />\nten-year-old black tuxedo with tapered legs and ragged<br />\nred velvet trim, tennis shoes, a nylon flowered leisure suit<br />\nshirt, and rainbow suspenders, so I easily blended in with<br />\nthe crowd. Ernest was picking people out of the audience<br />\nto come up to the stage and get healed: deaf people, blind<br />\npeople, bad backs and crooked limbs. I suspected that<br />\nmany of the fifty-or-so people were planted. It seemed<br />\nthat I would not have my chance to get in line. I was<br />\ngetting cold feet, but my two friends who had<br />\naccompanied me egged me on, so I decided to give it a go.<br />\nI stood at the back of the line, shaking with the nervous<br />\nfits I had designated for myself. A man came up to me<br />\nand asked what I was doing there. I put on the act and he<br />\nfell for it. The line moved quickly. This was it, me on<br />\nnational television.. Some of the shaking was definitely<br />\nreal. Closer and closer, I found myself tripping up the<br />\nwooden steps onto the stage-. I was on the stage. About<br />\nhalf a dozen men, women and children were lying down<br />\nflat, face up on the stage in rapture. One of the<br />\nsinger-bodyguards grabbed me by the arms and led me to<br />\nwhere the Master stood. He spoke to me: \"Are you born<br />\nagain?\" I shoud have said no, but I was petrified.<br />\n\"PRAISE GOD\" blurted from my lips. With a fervent<br />\n\"YAY-YAH!\" he slapped me on the top of my head. I let<br />\nout a grunt and a \"thank you Jesus\" and collapsed<br />\nbackwards. Two of the bodyguards caught me and placed<br />\nme on the blue velvet stage. I quivered on the ground,<br />\nfaking an orgasm, whispering \"love ya Jesus\" over and<br />\nover. Then I got up and was led by one of the bodyguards<br />\nto the side of the stage, where I continued my enraptured<br />\ntwitching while Angley played around with the<br />\nwheelchair section in the front. Finally I was led off the<br />\nstage. I made tracks and bolted out of that place faster<br />\nthan an angel fleeing from Heaven, knocking over some<br />\ncripples acidentally. I never looked back.<br />\nFor the next half hour, my friends and I were<br />\nspeechless. They just couldn't believe I had gone through<br />\nwith it. I didn't care any more; I just wanted to get the<br />\nhell out of there.<br />\nI have repeated this story many times to reactions of<br />\ncomplete disbelief. I'm glad it's over. I think I'll go back<br />\nto being a heathen; it's a lot safer.

A plastic punching bag was inflated and beat<br />\nupon by a large percentage of the male students. Now,<br />\nthis may seem highly intellectual to many, but think of<br />\nhow much brain power it took to put a sweater, a hat and<br />\nglasses on the dummy. If these actions appear juvenile to<br />\nyou, do not fear--you have yet to reach that level of<br />\nmentality, but, with practice and much work, it can be<br />\nachieved.<br />\nAren't these Hopkins men truly incredible?

They scatter about across the<br />\nworld but they never discontinue their journey to worlds<br />\nof still greater intellectual capacities. No, not the Hopkins<br />\nmale; he is forever seeking to become well-educated in all<br />\nfaculties of life and is unmatched in his dedication to<br />\nreach the highest state possible (of education?).<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 15<br /><br />\nI!<br /><br />\nh'<br /><br />\n!<br /><br />\n1.1. \u2022<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nRUG CONCERT<br />\nThe Peabody Contemporary<br />\nMusic Ensemble<br />\nFrederik Prausnitz, conductor<br />\nOtto Luening, commentator<br />\nProgram of works by Varese:<br />\nOctandre<br />\nDeserts<br />\nPoeme Electronique for Tape<br />\nfree admission<br />\nWednesday, November 15<br />\n8:15 p.m.<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 I NOVEMBER 10, 1978<br /><br />\nBLOOD DRIVE<br />\nMIN NI<br /><br />\nMIN INNINII<br /><br />\nIN NIIN<br /><br />\nMIIN MINIMUM.IN<br /><br />\nTHURSDAY,NOV.16<br />\n8:45 a.m. to 2:45 p.m.<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br /><br />\nCall ext. 8052 for an appointment<br />\n\u2022 or sign up in room 146, Garland.<br /><br />\nTECHNOLOGY AND<br />\nPOLICY AT MIT<br /><br />\nhAppENiNgs<br />\nNOVEMbER<br />\n10<br /><br />\nPIT<br /><br />\nA MASTER OF SCIENCE<br />\nPROGRAM designed for persons<br />\nwanting to participate in<br />\nformulating policies for the<br />\ndevelopment, use and control of<br />\ntechnology and its consequences.<br />\nStudents form individual curricula<br />\nto work on issues such as solar<br />\nenergy, the economics and legal<br />\naspects of materials recycling and<br />\nthe use of automation in<br />\nmanufacturing.<br /><br />\nFor information write:<br />\nProf. Richard de Neufville<br />\nRm 1-138, Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology<br />\nCambridge, Massachusetts<br />\n02139<br /><br />\nHome of the<br /><br />\n10 MINUTE<br />\nOIL CHANGE<br />\nOUR ONLY BUSINESS<br /><br />\nLyopE, OIL &amp; FILTER<br />\nAMERICAN<br /><br />\nThanks to you...<br />\nit works...<br />\nfor ALL OF US<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nRATIISkEUAR<br /><br />\n/THE<br /><br />\n$<br /><br />\n95<br /><br />\nFEATURING<br />\nPENNZOIL<br />\n10W-40<br /><br />\nPLUS<br />\nFOREIGN<br />\nTAX<br />\nCARS<br />\nPLUS FREE UNDERH000 R.UID CHECK<br /><br />\n1025 WEST 41st ST. 235-6336<br />\nBETWEEN FALLS ROAD &amp; ROLAND AVENUE<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4 MILE WEST OF ROTUNDA MALL<br /><br />\nROAST BEEF ON RYE, YES?<br /><br />\nUnited Way<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nbracadabra,<br />\nI sit on his knee.<br />\nPresto chango,<br />\nand now he is me.<br />\nHocus pocus,<br />\nwe take her to bed.<br />\nMagic is fun;<br />\nwe're dead.<br /><br />\nCOUNTRY-ROCK<br /><br />\nLiz Meyer &amp; The<br />\nMidnight Flyers<br /><br />\n11<br />\nLIVE DISCO BAND.<br />\nMeadow<br />\n\u2022<br />\n*DISCO<br /><br />\n16<br />\n17<br /><br />\nMilton<br />\nFreewater Band<br /><br />\n18<br />\nLIVE DISCO WITH<br /><br />\nStardate Band<br /><br />\n23, 24, &amp; 25<br />\nTURKEY BREAK<br /><br />\n30 * DISCO<br />\ndECEMbER\"<br />\nBOOGIE WITH<br /><br />\nBrandy<br />\nClimbadonkey<br /><br />\n* DISCO<br /><br />\nMAGIC<br />\nATERRIFYING LOVE STORY<br /><br />\nJOSEPH E.LEVINE PRESENTS<br />\nMAGIC<br />\nANTHONY HOPKINS ANN-MARGRET<br />\nBURGESS MEREDITH ED LAUTER<br />\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER C.O.

He placed<br />\nand the next morning he found<br />\nan ad in the newspar,.<br />\nthey told him their tragic<br />\nWhen<br />\nmodels.<br />\ntwo aspiring<br />\nstory, the artist quickly hired them. But after a few days,<br />\nthe artist realized that they were not what he wanted. He<br />\nput another ad in the paper, and the next morning<br />\nanother couple appeared at his door. The man and the<br />\nwoman were both professional models, and the artist<br />\nsuccessfully completed his painting.<br />\nThe preceding anecdote demonstrates the talent needed<br />\nto portray stereotypes. The genius of Born Yesterday, the<br />\nnew play at Center Stage, rests on exactly that. Though<br />\nevery character is a cliche, each actor manages to play his<br />\nrole exactly right--neither denigrating into farcical<br />\nself-caricature nor ascending to heights of pompous<br />\nimportance.<br />\nThe plot is simple. Immediately following the end of<br />\nWorld War II, a junkyard.. boss/hoodlum goes to<br />\nWashington DC to take advantage of the flow of scrap<br />\nmetal returning from overseas. In order to do so, he needs<br />\nspecial legislation to rescind restrictions on \"free<br />\nenterprise.\" So he obtains the best Senator money can<br />\nbuy. The complication arises when this Boss realizes that<br />\nhis uncouth \"dumb blonde\" girlfriend could be a social<br />\nliability. He entrusts her to an investigative journalist<br />\nwho, in the grand manner of Henry Higgins, exposes his<br />\nLiza Doolittle to literature and learning and falls in love<br />\nwith her. The hitherto \"dumb blonde\" wises up, and<br />\nturns the table on the boss and political corruption. In the<br />\nend, democracy wins, and the journalist-professor and his<br />\nconcubine-protege marry and presumably live happily<br />\never after.<br />\nThe characters are even more conventional than the<br />\nplot. The \"dumb blonde,\" aptly named Billie Dawn,<br />\nwears revealing outfits more appropriate for the chorus<br />\nline than for the most expensive hotel room in the capital.<br />\nShe slinks suggestively up and down the staircase, uttering<br />\nsuch gems as \"I'm stupid and I like it.\" Even her<br />\ntransformation does little to alter her basic personality; to<br /><br />\nSergiu Comissiono<br />\nKeith leIrrett<br /><br />\nwit, \"Last night I went to bed wonderin' and thinkin',<br />\nand I couldn't get to sleep for ten minutes!\" Harry Brock,<br />\npossibly a relative of Saturday Night's tax fraud people, is<br />\nthe Boss; though he displays street cunning and crude<br />\npower, he is just as \"dumb\" as his girlfriend. A typical<br />\nline: \"You ain't gonna be tellin' nobody nothin' soon.\"<br />\nPaul Verrall, the journalist and moral descendant of<br />\nThomas Paine, delivers long-winded speeches on the value<br />\nof government of the people, by the people, and for the<br />\npeople. The fourth principal, Ed Devery, is the epitome of<br />\nthe smart, idealistic lawyer who sold out for Big Bucks.<br />\nHe is uncompromisingly cynical and drunk. When his boss<br />\nremarks, \"I'm a junk man,\" and the Senator replies,<br />\n\"That's no disgrace in America,\" Devery quips, \"Not if<br />\nyou're a big enough junk man.\"<br />\nIn short, everything about the play is a cliche. Only the<br />\nactors give it the life that it would lack in less competent<br />\nhands. Christine Baranski (Billie Dawn) has the voice and<br />\nmannerisms down to a \"T.\" The classic scene has her<br />\nplaying gin with the Boss. She intricately rearranges her<br />\ncards and adds up points on her fingers. Her Brooklyn<br />\naccent is flawless.<br />\nNorman Smith (Harry Brock) comes on strong--almost<br />\nstrong enough to steal the play from his co-star. His voice<br />\nresonates with the rough pride of a poor boy made good<br />\nand he refuses to bend to sophisticated gents; they must<br />\naccept him while he flexes his toes on the coffee table.<br />\nRobert Pastene (Ed Devery) is alternately wincing and<br />\nfalling lower in his self-esteem. His delivery is flawless; his<br />\nbest speech is one in which he drunkenly reels off a<br />\nnumber of unconvincing maxims that Harry cannot<br />\nunderstand.<br />\nEnsemble theatre has long been a hallmark of Center<br />\nStage. Actors often turn up in several of the season's<br />\nproductions; those with big parts in one play may as often<br />\nas not have smaller ones in the next. This is the case with<br />\nRichard Malone (Bellhop), who played the son in The<br />\nShadow Box, and Daniel Szelag (the Assistant Manager),<br />\nwho played the interviewer in The Shadow Box and tod(<br />\n'part in several of last season's productions.<br />\nUndoubtedly, the acting makes this play. But the<br />\n, actors are not only adding clever mannerisms to their<br /><br />\nlEptertaimpept<br /><br />\ncompilEd by<br />\nChRisTy 110 ANdERSON<br />\nSTEplIEN bARR<br />\nSTEVE RANdAll<br /><br />\nrre<br /><br />\nBilly Joel<br /><br />\nSorcet<br /><br />\nBorn Y<br /><br />\n10CC<br /><br />\nRECENT<br />\nRECORd<br />\nRELEASES<br /><br />\nroles; they also evoke sympathy. Harry Brock, the<br />\nphilistine hoodlum, is pathetic when he stalks the<br />\nwindow, waiting for his girlfriend to return. When she<br />\nrefuses his desperate offer of marriage, we feel a twinge of<br />\npity--until we shake ourselves and realize just who it is<br />\nthat we are pitying. The same is true in the case of Billie<br />\nDawn. She is funny, yet touching, when she parrots her<br />\nmentor's homily about \"the happy peasant.'<br />\nThe set is second only to the acting in excellence. The<br />\n1940's drawing room is decorated in expensive kitsch.<br />\nSymmetrical cupids grace the double doors; the coffee<br />\ntable looks like it came from one of the swankest Howard<br />\nJohnson motels.<br />\nFinally, credit must be given to the director, Steven<br />\nRobman, fori making two very astute decisions: 1) not to<br />\nupdate the play to make it another Watergate rehash, and<br />\n2) not to play the \"democracy triumphant\" scene at the<br />\nend for laughs. Both decisions reflect artistic maturity and<br />\nexperience.<br /><br />\nBILLY JOEL<br />\n52nd STREET<br />\nLet it be known! Billy Joel has made it! For years, Joel<br />\nwas the spokesman for the suburban counter-culture of<br />\nthe Seventies, but now he has assimilated the success<br />\nformula for a pop hit. His previous album, The Stranger,<br />\nwas milked for four singles, the fourth one beginning to<br />\nget airplay about the time the new album was released.<br />\nEvery song on 52nd Street has so many hooks you can't<br />\nhelp being snagged by the catchy melodies and the 'bad<br />\nboy' lyrics which have turned sweet. Two songs, \"Big<br />\nShot\" and \"My Life\" have already made their way into<br />\nTop 40 circles, and undoubtedly, there are more to come.<br />\nIt's not that this new album is bad - the music is too<br />\nlikable to be rejected - but it is a shame that one of rock's<br />\nmost insightful raconteurs must be lost for a pop star. SB<br />\nMORE 0111<br /><br />\np. 20<br /><br />\nMY SONG<br />\nKEITH JARRETT,<br />\nWhen formulating a critical response to music, it is<br />\ncustomary to try to draw on familiar analogies and<br />\nmetaphors. By relating the music to something in, the<br />\nphysical world, the reader gets the best sense of the<br />\nemotions and experiences the music is trying to evoke.<br />\nThis is not possible when responding to the music of<br />\nKeith Jarrett. One is forced into superlatives: this new<br />\nalbum of traditional and avant-garde compositions for<br />\njazz quartet is simply exquisite. The emphasis on most<br />\ntrack s is on melody, making this one of Jarrett's most<br />\naccessible albums. The slower songs, especially the title<br />\ncut, are beautiful and refreshing, making you feel calm<br />\nand relaxed. The more upbeat songs make you want to<br />\nget up and dance with joy. And when you've finished<br />\nlistening to the album, you want Jarrett right there so you<br />\ncan thank him for making you feel so good. The melodic<br />\nblend of Jarrett's sensitive piano and Jan Garbarek's<br />\nemotional saxophones make this one of the most- pleasing<br />\nalbums to listen to. But the only way to understand this is<br />\nto listen to the record and experience these feelings. I<br />\ncan't tell what they are like, only what they are.<br />\nSBA<br /><br />\nBROTHER TO BROTHER<br />\nGINO VANNELL1<br />\nThis is an album of power and romance. Certainly the<br />\nmost successful of Vanelli's works, this amazing effort<br />\nmust be considered the culmination of the artist's most<br />\nindividual style. The album is a continuation of the<br />\nVannelli touch: rock, disco, and jazz fused into a clean<br />\nelement of force, motion and sensuality. The appeal of<br />\nthis work is the unity which the artist was able to achieve.<br />\nIt is an ebb and flow from song to song, but this highly<br />\nindividual style maintains a continuity which is<br />\ninsurpassable. The particulars of the cut do not matter, as<br />\nin \"I Just Wanna Stop,\" the single released from the<br />\nalbum, a slow and passionate release of emotion; and the<br />\ntitle song, \"Brother to Brother,\" an exuberant exercise of<br />\nthe Vannelli method. The strength of both songs is in<br />\ntheir ability to transcend the bounds of subject matter<br />\nand musical technicalities. The process of controlled<br />\nemotion and force is the theme of the entire work, a<br />\ntheme which cannot be held by a single style such as roc-k<br />\nor jazz. It needs the control of a fusion of styles. This<br />\nuniversality reaches its height in \"The River Must Flow.\"<br />\nVannelli grabs at the first note of this cut and refuses to<br />\nallow the listener to escape. His songs present this process<br />\neffectively throughout the album. He is an artist moving<br />\nin one \u2022 direction, toward a music which captivates and<br />\nholds the audience. Vannelli is in command of his art, an<br />\nart which is all his own.<br />\nCJA<br />\nTHE ESSENTIAL<br />\nJIMI HENDRIX<br />\nThis fellow definitely shows some promise as a guitar<br />\nplayer. Rumor has it that Hendrix, a black man, was<br />\ninspired to master the guitar after claiming to have been<br />\nspoken to by the ghost of Frank Marino while on a<br />\nparticularly bad acid trip, but we all know how<br />\ntrustworthy these drugged-out rockers are. Although<br />\nsounding at times!like -a throwback to the psychedelia of<br />\nthe late 60's, Hendrix occasionally displays flashes of<br />\nsheer brilliance. His strategic use of feedback, while<br />\ncertainly not innovative, is, nonetheless, often quite<br />\nengaging. With some better material and a little luck, Jimi<br />\ncould very well be the next Robin Trower. Keep an eye<br />\non him...<br />\nSR<br /><br />\nPAGE 18 INOVEMBER 10, 1978<br /><br />\nFrom Bucharest To Baltimore<br />\nBY STEPHEN BARR and VINAY LAL<br /><br />\nSergiu Comissiona, searching for greater musical and<br />\npolitical freedom, came to the United States to take the<br />\npost of conductor and music director of the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony Orchestra. In his ten -years here,_ he has<br />\ndeveloped a third-rate organization into one of the<br />\npremier orchestras in America. His main commitment is in<br />\nBaltimore, but he has also gained world-wide recognition<br />\nfrom his work as music advisor to the American<br />\nSymphony Orchestra\u2014the\" orchestra that governs<br />\nitself--and from his stints as guest conductor with almost<br />\nevery major orchestra. This final segment of a two-part<br />\ninterview deals with his work with the Baltimore<br />\nSymphony and his thoughts about Baltimore, America<br />\nand life itself.<br /><br />\n\u2022 Do you think an orchestra has a responsibility to<br />\nthe public to present contemporary works?<br />\nI think yes. If you are in New York and the New<br />\nYork Philharmonic doesn't do something, you'll go to<br />\nanother orchestra. You have, every day, many different<br />\norchestras, you have different groups. But here in<br />\nBaltimore, as being the main musical organization, you<br />\nhave an obligation to the community. We are not the<br />\nmusic teacher of the city, but I think I had a difficult task<br />\nin Baltimore, with all respect to my predecessors, because<br />\nthey performed here a very limited repertoire. I'm not<br />\nsuch a genius that I could perform one hundred new<br />\nworks in Baltimore, but from this hundred, I don't know<br />\nhow many werevery solid repertoire works which had<br />\nnever been done in Baltimore. Not all the Schubert, not<br />\nRite ofSpring, not...I don't know. If you look at this list<br />\nit's amazing what was done for the first time here. You<br />\ncan't have an orchestra without hearing these things. It's<br />\nnot only new adventurous contemporary works, but I had<br />\nto fill some very important gaps.<br /><br />\nllustration by Lisa Kay Pease<br /><br />\nWhat. major changes have taken place with the BSO<br />\nsince you have come to Baltimore to make the orchestra<br />\nso respected in America?<br />\nI think it is becoming one of the very important<br />\norchestras in America. lam very proud of them because<br />\nthe orchestra themselves must be credited. I hope I helped<br />\nthem, but I think they should be credited with this<br />\nenormous development. But I think, apart of this, I must<br />\nbe credited with things I did in Baltimore that hadn't<br />\nbeen done before. This is my tenth anniversary season,<br />\nand I have a list of what I have done to musicmaking in<br />\nBaltimore during my ten years. These are: five hundred<br />\nfifty-four concerts, more than one hundred new works<br />\nthat I did in Baltimore\u2014never before performed here, over<br />\nsixty American composers., I think that not only for an<br />\norchestra is this important, but the public, too, was<br />\nexposed to new music. Not as much as I would like, but I<br />\nhave whetted an appetite for music and new things in<br />\nBaltimore. The orchestra is doing new things, travelling<br />\nand going to the Kennedy Center, Carnegie Hall,<br />\npresenting our flag with honor always. We have started to<br />\nmake records. We have a young conductors competition<br />\nin Baltimore which won national attraction. And we have<br />\nnew instruments for the musicians coming here. Anyone<br />\nwho wants to buy a new instrument can get the money,<br />\nand pay it back in ten years without any interest. This is<br />\nvery important. And most of it, more than anything, I<br />\nthink the orchestra achieved a sense of pride which they<br />\ndidn't have before. For this I am very proud of them.<br /><br />\nCould you explain the conflicts and causes of the<br />\nstrike this summer?<br />\nIt is very easy. The orchestra, as I said before was<br />\nmusically and also financially retarded. And the orchestra<br />\nhad a very fast development. We grew fast musically, but<br />\nfinancially we grew very slow. So it was, and still is, not<br />\nbalanced--the artistic stature we have now and our<br />\nsalaries. This was the main reason for the strike, and even<br />\nwith the three-year contract, the orchestra is still<br />\nunderpaid compared to other orchestras of our standing.<br />\nWe made major steps with this contract to bring the<br />\norchestra up to the same level as others, but still it is not.<br />\nCertainly this represents always a dangeer for our<br />\ndevelopment. In our lives, everyone wants to have a better<br />\nlife, and is tempted by better salaries of other orchestras.<br /><br />\nWhat do you think of rock music and how do ybu<br />\nrelate it to the music to which you have dedicated your<br />\nlife?<br />\nLike all good men, I try to understand the music,<br />\nsometimes even to enjoy it. I don't try to reject it. If it is<br />\ntoo noisy, yes. With the harder rock, the noise is so<br />\nimpossible that it is no longer music. It destroys the ears,<br />\ndestroys the taste. It is like eating, though. I think that I<br />\ncompare this kind of music with dessert, with ice cream,<br />\nwith popcorn. You cannot eat only popcorn andice<br />\ncream. You need the proteins and the vitamins, the good<br />\nfood. Otherwise you will destroy your organism if all you<br />\neat is junk food. I enjoy having a hot dog on the street,<br />\nbut I think, still, you need to eat properly. Like in<br />\nliterature. You can't just read the magazines and papers.<br />\nYou have to read a good book.<br /><br />\nHow does life today in Rumania compare with life<br />\nin America, and do you feel you will ever want to go<br />\nback?<br />\nI don't have a desire now like I did<br />\nhave. Four years ago I visited my home, the cemetary<br />\nwhere my father is. I saw a couple of friends. But I am an<br />\nAmerican citizen. I feel like an American citizen. This is<br />\nmy home. Probably I will have the desire to go back and I<br />\nwill, but my life is in America.<br />\nI left Rumania ten years ago, but I have conductor<br />\nfriends who have told me what it's like. There is an<br />\nenormous desire for progress. There are some very fine<br />\nmusicians, and there is a lot of activity. The good thing is<br />\nthat they are helped. There are many orchestras. They<br />\nare trained. The state is paying for the music education,<br />\nso they are developing a lot of musicians. THere are other,<br />\nvery bad, things. For instance, the musician is obliged to<br />\nretire after twenty-five years of service. So if he starts at<br />\ntwenty or twenty-one, at forty-six he is retired. A<br />\nmusician of my age--and I don't consider myself very<br />\nold--should not have to retire now. I think I am hungry to<br />\ndo more, but they are obliged to retire.There is no<br />\nparadise on earth, not for the musician, the doctor, not<br />\nfor anyone.<br /><br />\nSergiu Comissiona<br />\nWe lost during the years a number of very fine musicians<br />\nwho were attracted by other major orchestras paying<br />\nmore money.<br />\nWhat are your impressions of Baltimore over the<br />\nyears you have been here? Do you participate in any<br />\nother activities around town?<br />\nIn ten years, I think the town grew enormously, like<br />\nthe Symphony. And the identity of the town started to<br />\ngrow. Culturally. The people are more aware that we are a<br />\ncity. There is now a sense of pride in this town. The<br />\nCity Fair was a tremendous example. To see this crowd of<br />\nall the neighborhoods pulled together. It makes you<br />\nhappy. This is the future. This is America. It makes you<br />\nreally optimistic, and I'm optimistic.<br />\nI'm not an Oriole fan because I don't understand<br />\nbaseball. I was at a game once and I was very bored. My<br />\nsport was soccer which is becoming more and more<br />\npopular here. If the soccer should come here, I would be<br />\nmore involved in the sports. I like to swim, to take walks.<br />\nI like to watch athletics, but baseball, even football, are<br />\nmysteries.<br /><br />\nDo you ever feel you have lost identity as a<br />\nmusician?<br />\nNo, I...I sometimes feel I am losing my identity as a<br />\nnormal person. I don't have enough time to read. I don't<br />\nhave enough time to enjoy friends. To go to cinema. I'm<br />\nlosing sometimes my identity as a person, but I don't<br />\nthink I lose my identity as a musician. And I believe still,<br />\nthat the most important thing to be in life is a human<br />\nbeing. Even more to be a musician.<br />\nWhat do you see as the role of the artist in our<br />\nsociety?<br />\nThe role of the artist, or any other professional, is to<br />\nmake the life better. A doctor, an engineer, everyone. I<br />\nfeel that music is a very important part of life, and I think<br />\nthat music should become a part of everyone's life. Of<br />\ncourse I'm .doing this because I love music, but 1 think<br />\nthat if everyone loved music they would have a better<br />\nlife.I am very sincere. I feel that to be without music is to<br />\nbe color blind, or not enjoying to eat, not to make love,<br />\nnot to see a nice tree, to enjoy the sun, to go to the sea or<br />\nsee a nice mountain, to smell a flower. Life is much nicer<br />\nwith music. And I want to bring music to everyone's life.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n11\u20221111111\u2018<br /><br />\nSorcerer--William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist<br />\nand The French Connection, has not filmed a story<br />\nof mysticism or the supernatural, but a story of four<br />\nstrangers trapped in the filthy and primitive<br />\nbackwater of South America.

The music is indeed of this genre, but the totality of<br />\nthe album is very different. TRB is probably the only true<br />\npolitical protest band of the Seventies. It is not the<br />\nviciousness and brutality of the Music which is important<br />\nin their composition; music is secondary to the lyrics. For<br />\nit is the lyrics which set TRB apart from othert bands of its<br />\ngenre: unequivocal, they only present the situation the<br />\nway it is, exposing what's wrong and what's bad in<br />\ntoday's society. TRB sings about \"yer sister who can't get<br />\nan abortion\" or \"yer best mate getting paki-bashed, or<br />\nsent down for possessing one joint of marijuana\", but they<br />\nmake no pretense to knowing the answer. Their goal<br />\nthrough music is \"to ease even a tiny fraction of the<br />\nprejudice and intolerance in this world.\" Band leader Tom<br />\nRobinson is gay, and in the song \"Glad To Be Gay\" he<br />\ndoes not condemn, discrimination based on sexual<br />\npreference, he only expresses the problems with being<br />\ngay, and his appreciation and understanding of his sexual<br />\nstatus. Perhaps it is his disdain for folk music which made<br />\nTom Robinson become a 'punk rocker', but his songs of<br />\nprotest are as socially perceptive in the Seventies as<br />\nSB<br />\nDylan's songs were a decade ago.<br />\nI OCC<br />\n\"DEADLOCK HOLIDAY\"<br />\na<br />\nThat's<br />\nAmerica?<br />\nin<br />\nhit<br />\nQuick, what was the last reggae<br />\nto<br />\nback<br />\nway<br />\nthe<br />\nall<br />\ngo<br />\nto<br />\nhave<br />\nYou<br />\ntough one, isn't it?<br />\n1974, when Eric Clapton topped the charts with Bob<br />\nMarley's \"I Shot the Sheriff.\" Four years later, we find 10<br />\ncc goin' reggae with \"Deadlock Holiday.\" Though the<br />\nreggae purists in Jamaica may cringe at this white<br />\nexploitation of their music, the fact remains that htthis is<br />\none of the more interesting singles to hit the airwaves in a<br />\nquite some time. A smash hit in England, \"Deadlock<br />\nHoliday\" features the usual crisp production and flawless<br />\nvocals we have come to expect from Stewart and<br />\nGouldman. Whether disco-loving America will catch onto<br />\nthe Rasatafarian funkiness is another matter altogether,<br />\nSR<br />\nthough.<br /><br />\nEdgar Varese<br />\nYES<br />\nTORM ATO<br />\nThe only gratifying aspect of the new Yes album is that<br />\nthe record jacket, displaying photograph of the band<br />\nmembers, is splattered with tomatoes. My only response<br />\nto this album would be to bomb the band with eggs,<br />\nvegetables and other debris. The music certainly deserves<br />\nit. The rejuvenation of Yes seemed promising with Going<br />\nFor The One and the return of Rick Wakeman, but this<br />\nalbum is downright insulting to anyone's musical taste.<br />\nYes has been labeled a 'cosmic' band with precise<br />\ntechnical wizardry, but Tormato sounds like five musicians<br />\nlost ins space. There is no synthesis of the sometimes<br />\nbrilliant technical achievements of the individual band<br />\nmembers. Perhaps the main problem is Jon Anderson,<br />\nleader/songwriter/lead singer/self-proclaimed guru of<br />\n'rock' music. He not only can't write a melody, but he<br />\nwouldn't be able to sing one if he could. The music of Yes<br />\nis absolutely toneless, without melody. One can't expect<br />\nthe 'good ole days' again, but it would be nice if Yes<br />\ncould come up with more than tone-deaf music from the<br />\nSB<br />\ncosmos.<br /><br />\nThe Office of the Associate Dean<br />\nand The Metro Center Present<br /><br />\nThe New Ambaosia<br />\n50e-walk Buffet<br /><br />\nInternational Fellows<br />\nLecture Series<br /><br />\n(in the Ratbskellea)<br /><br />\nMENU<br />\nMoneoag,11/13 Capveo Roast Beef<br />\n(aa jas ani5 gRavy),<br /><br />\nWEST BERLIN:<br />\nTHE PHYSICAL,<br />\nECONOMIC and<br />\nPOLITICAL SITUATION<br /><br />\nFrederik Prausnitz will direct the Peabody<br />\nContemporary Music Ensemble in a free rug concert of<br />\nthe works, of Edgar Varese on Wednesday, November 15<br />\nat 8:15 p.m. in the Glass Pavilion of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity. American composer Otto Luening will serve as<br />\ncommentator for the informal program, which will<br />\ninclude Varese's Deserts, Octandre, and Poeme<br />\nElectronique. Mr. Luening is a prolific composer of<br />\norchestral works, vocal music and solo instrumental<br />\nworks, and since 1952 he has concentrated much of his<br />\nwork in the field of electronic music.<br />\nEdgar Varese was born in Paris in '1887. He studied<br />\nwith D'Indy and Roussel in the Schola Cantorum in Paris,<br />\nand with Widor at the Paris Conservatoire after winning<br />\nthe \"bourse artistique,\" a stipend from the city of Paris.<br />\nVarese organized and led the chorus of the Universite<br />\nPopulaire, and became the first conductor of the<br />\nSymphonische Chor in Berlin. He came to the United<br />\nStates in 1919 and organized the New Symphony<br />\nOrchestra, becoming active in the promotion of the Pan<br />\nAmerican Society and the International Composers Guild.<br />\nThe developments in electronic music following the<br />\nSecond World War saw a resurgence in Varese's career<br />\nprior to his death in 1965.<br />\nRegarding Deserts, which was written in 1954 for<br />\nwind instruments, percussion and interpolations of<br />\n\"organized sound,\" Varese has stated: \"The work was<br />\nconceived for two different media: instrumental sounds<br />\nand real sounds (recorded and processed) that musical<br />\ninstruments are unable to produce...I have always looked<br />\nupon the industrial world as a rich source of beautiful<br />\nsounds, an unexplored mine of music in the matrix. So I<br />\nwent to various factories in search of certain sounds that I<br />\nneeded for Deserts and recorded them.\" Henry Cowell<br />\nhasicommentated that, \"Deserts is the best work, the<br />\nmost mature, the largest and the most integrated, by a<br />\ncomposer who holds a unique position among the world's<br />\ncreators.\"<br />\nAlso scored for wind instruments is Octandre, which<br />\nwas written by Varese in 1924.
