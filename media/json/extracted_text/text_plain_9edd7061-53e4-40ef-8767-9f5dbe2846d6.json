Bowdoin College is looking<br />\nfor a teacher who is evidently to<br />\nbe a cross between Einstein and<br />\nthe late Wayne B. Wheeler. The<br />\nsuccessful applicant must not only<br />\nteach two courses in chemistry,<br />\nanswer all questions from undergraduates in other chemistry courses<br />\nbut he also must belong to the Prohibition enforcement army. Says the<br />\nletter which extends the offer, \"It<br />\nis quite important that the man we<br />\nget should be able to get on with<br />\nundergraduates and have sufficient<br />\ncommon sense to prevent him from<br />\nthe indescretion of diverting laboratory alcohol into unscientific channels.\" Evidently Bowdoin chemists<br />\nare skilled in the art of manufacturing synthetic gin out of laboratory alcohol. In that case, we should<br />\nlike to have the proper instructions,<br />\nfor so far we have always hesitated<br />\nto use our alcohol here for fear of<br />\nthe ruinous effects of the denaturant<br />\non our internal apparatus. There<br />\nhave been times when some of our<br />\nluckier students have managed to<br />\nget pure alcohol and we recall one<br />\nparticular quantitative analyst of<br />\nlast year who succeeded quite well<br />\nin the concocting of rather good<br />\n<br />\nsynthetic gin. At least it was enough<br />\nto keep him in a \"happy\" mood for<br />\nseveral days.<br />\nWe haven't discovered yet,<br />\nwhether or not the professor in<br />\ncharge of the course had any hand<br />\nin diverting this alcohol into \"unscientific channels\" nor did Ile ever<br />\nshow the effects of having shared<br />\nin the enjoyment of the finished<br />\nproduct.<br />\nBowdoin, incidently, expects this<br />\nnew instructor to be a \"walking<br />\ntext-book, for he is to answer any<br />\nand all questions which the chemistry students may ask him. We wonder what he is supposed to do if<br />\none of his students should ask him<br />\nhow to make gin. In his spare time,<br />\nthe instructor is to do research<br />\nwork, but we should imagine that<br />\nwith his duties as a prohibition<br />\nagent, he'll have very little time to<br />\ninvestigate anything but ways and<br />\nmeans of preventing drunkenness among the undergraduates.<br />\nFor all these multifarious duties,<br />\nthe munificent salary of $2,000 is<br />\noffered, though such a man would<br />\nobviously be worth $20,000.

Some of our Eastern universities serve the<br />\npurpose admirably. There are now and always will be, I suppose, institutions where the 'drifters' will find a place. In fact, most collegiate<br />\ninstitutions today are organized on a basis that meets their needs. At<br />\nHopkins we are saying that the bright boy shall also have his chance.<br />\nThe type of institution that meets his needs is rare. Frankly, Hopkins<br />\nis preparing to meet this need.\"<br />\nWe feel that the above paragraphs constitute a full and adequate<br />\nexplanation of the so-called new plan. We are all familiar with the<br />\nidle type of undergraduate and the great majority of us are \"drifters!\"<br />\nIt is quite clear that the \"liberal education\" offered at most universities, including the undergraduate department at Hopkins, conforms<br />\nideally to the needs of these men. It is equally clear that a young<br />\nman who has decided on a particular line of scholarly work and who<br />\nhas the intelligence to do well in his chosen branch is wasting a great<br />\ndeal of time in pursuing the academic course. The new plan affords<br />\na splendid opportunity to such men. It is quite necessary to have colIeges where the \"drifter\" may find his place, but the point made by<br />\nDean Berry is that there are an abundance of such institutions in this<br />\ncountry, but that there are few for the \"bright boy.\"<br />\nAnother comment of Dean Berry offers a field for a little introspection\u2014an exercise which is but little practical by the average college<br />\nstudent. He says, \"Roughly speaking, there are three types of brains\u2014<br />\nthe sieve-like, the sponge-like and the tool-like brain. The sieve brain<br />\nretains very little; only a modicum of what passes through sticks. The<br />\nstudent with the sieve brain ought not to go beyond the grade school.<br />\nThe sponge brain absorbs and retains whatever is put in\u2014and what<br />\ngoes in is not changed by criticism and reflection. Perhaps the student<br />\nwith the sponge-like brain should be put through high school. Certainly, he should not be admitted to a first-rate collegiate institution.<br />\nThe student with the tool-like brain, which enables him to inquire and<br />\ninvestigate for himself\u2014the brain that is capable of acquiring a point<br />\nof view, of criticism and of holding judgment in reserve\u2014that is the<br />\nonly type of student who should be admitted to a first-rate collegiate<br />\ninstitution.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets to announce the resignations of Stewart<br />\nL.:Smith and Lewis Danziger from the editorial staff.<br />\n<br />\nNeedless to say, the variformed<br />\nT nglish lingoes were dissipated a<br />\nf w moments after the curtain rise,<br />\na were the strange body twistings,<br />\n1.1 at I judge were intended to conv ey to a presumptively uneducated<br />\na dience that all the sons of John<br />\nla ull are very, very casual.<br />\nAs usual in this type of perfq rmance the action drags along<br />\nal slow pace.

Bowdoin College is looking<br />\nfor a teacher who is evidently to<br />\nbe a cross between Einstein and<br />\nthe late Wayne B. Wheeler. The<br />\nsuccessful applicant must not only<br />\nteach two courses in chemistry,<br />\nanswer all questions from undergraduates in other chemistry courses<br />\nbut he also must belong to the Prohibition enforcement army. Says the<br />\nletter which extends the offer, \"It<br />\nis quite important that the man we<br />\nget should be able to get on with<br />\nundergraduates and have sufficient<br />\ncommon sense to prevent him from<br />\nthe indescretion of diverting laboratory alcohol into unscientific channels.\" Evidently Bowdoin chemists<br />\nare skilled in the art of manufacturing synthetic gin out of laboratory alcohol. In that case, we should<br />\nlike to have the proper instructions,<br />\nfor so far we have always hesitated<br />\nto use our alcohol here for fear of<br />\nthe ruinous effects of the denaturant<br />\non our internal apparatus. There<br />\nhave been times when some of our<br />\nluckier students have managed to<br />\nget pure alcohol and we recall one<br />\nparticular quantitative analyst of<br />\nlast year who succeeded quite well<br />\nin the concocting of rather good<br /><br />\nsynthetic gin. At least it was enough<br />\nto keep him in a \"happy\" mood for<br />\nseveral days.<br />\nWe haven't discovered yet,<br />\nwhether or not the professor in<br />\ncharge of the course had any hand<br />\nin diverting this alcohol into \"unscientific channels\" nor did Ile ever<br />\nshow the effects of having shared<br />\nin the enjoyment of the finished<br />\nproduct.<br />\nBowdoin, incidently, expects this<br />\nnew instructor to be a \"walking<br />\ntext-book, for he is to answer any<br />\nand all questions which the chemistry students may ask him. We wonder what he is supposed to do if<br />\none of his students should ask him<br />\nhow to make gin. In his spare time,<br />\nthe instructor is to do research<br />\nwork, but we should imagine that<br />\nwith his duties as a prohibition<br />\nagent, he'll have very little time to<br />\ninvestigate anything but ways and<br />\nmeans of preventing drunkenness among the undergraduates.<br />\nFor all these multifarious duties,<br />\nthe munificent salary of $2,000 is<br />\noffered, though such a man would<br />\nobviously be worth $20,000.

Some of our Eastern universities serve the<br />\npurpose admirably. There are now and always will be, I suppose, institutions where the 'drifters' will find a place. In fact, most collegiate<br />\ninstitutions today are organized on a basis that meets their needs. At<br />\nHopkins we are saying that the bright boy shall also have his chance.<br />\nThe type of institution that meets his needs is rare. Frankly, Hopkins<br />\nis preparing to meet this need.\"<br />\nWe feel that the above paragraphs constitute a full and adequate<br />\nexplanation of the so-called new plan. We are all familiar with the<br />\nidle type of undergraduate and the great majority of us are \"drifters!\"<br />\nIt is quite clear that the \"liberal education\" offered at most universities, including the undergraduate department at Hopkins, conforms<br />\nideally to the needs of these men. It is equally clear that a young<br />\nman who has decided on a particular line of scholarly work and who<br />\nhas the intelligence to do well in his chosen branch is wasting a great<br />\ndeal of time in pursuing the academic course. The new plan affords<br />\na splendid opportunity to such men. It is quite necessary to have colIeges where the \"drifter\" may find his place, but the point made by<br />\nDean Berry is that there are an abundance of such institutions in this<br />\ncountry, but that there are few for the \"bright boy.\"<br />\nAnother comment of Dean Berry offers a field for a little introspection\u2014an exercise which is but little practical by the average college<br />\nstudent. He says, \"Roughly speaking, there are three types of brains\u2014<br />\nthe sieve-like, the sponge-like and the tool-like brain. The sieve brain<br />\nretains very little; only a modicum of what passes through sticks. The<br />\nstudent with the sieve brain ought not to go beyond the grade school.<br />\nThe sponge brain absorbs and retains whatever is put in\u2014and what<br />\ngoes in is not changed by criticism and reflection. Perhaps the student<br />\nwith the sponge-like brain should be put through high school. Certainly, he should not be admitted to a first-rate collegiate institution.<br />\nThe student with the tool-like brain, which enables him to inquire and<br />\ninvestigate for himself\u2014the brain that is capable of acquiring a point<br />\nof view, of criticism and of holding judgment in reserve\u2014that is the<br />\nonly type of student who should be admitted to a first-rate collegiate<br />\ninstitution.\"<br />\nThe News-Letter regrets to announce the resignations of Stewart<br />\nL.:Smith and Lewis Danziger from the editorial staff.<br /><br />\nNeedless to say, the variformed<br />\nT nglish lingoes were dissipated a<br />\nf w moments after the curtain rise,<br />\na were the strange body twistings,<br />\n1.1 at I judge were intended to conv ey to a presumptively uneducated<br />\na dience that all the sons of John<br />\nla ull are very, very casual.<br />\nAs usual in this type of perfq rmance the action drags along<br />\nal slow pace.
