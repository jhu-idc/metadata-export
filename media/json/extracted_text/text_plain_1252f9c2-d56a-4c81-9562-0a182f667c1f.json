That part.<br />\nSloan wrote what this article was originally going to<br />\nbe. He gave it to me at 3:30 or so and went to bed. I<br />\nfinished writing a really poor paper, had some soup and<br />\nlook at this now, as you look at it, but to tell you the<br />\ntruth my mind isn't really on you, the reader. If anything it's on the sun. Sloan says:<br />\n\"The single image that we all shall carry with us<br />\ninto the new decade is the one that was caught, in the<br />\nquaint American fashion, by a home movie camera: the<br />\nskull ofJohn F. Kennedy being fragmented into oblivion<br />\nbeneath an explosion of blood in the back seat of a<br />\nLincoln Continental convertible. The explosion of blood<br />\nin that picture managed to cover the remainder of the<br />\ndecade so that now, at its close, we can remember little<br />\nelse. We can regret only that Haskell Wexler was not<br />\nthere to take a shot, for then, perhaps the image of the<br />\nblood would have been clearer, we might have known<br />\nwhat to expect.\"<br />\nI don't know. I can't say I was bothered by the first<br />\nKennedy assassination at the time--I was more sort of<br />\nnegatively amused. A 15 year old cynic, I thought the<br />\nwhole New Frontier business a lot of PR shit, which a<br />\nlot of it was, and I thought it would probably be more<br />\nexciting to vote for Barry Goldwater who at least flew<br />\njet fighters while the best Kennedy could do was sail his<br />\ndamn yacht with a lot of other rich people.<br />\nI don't know. I remember some commentator saying<br />\nhow it was good that there wasn't any regular TV that<br />\nweekend so that even the youngest child would sense<br />\nthat something was very wrong. Aldous Huxley died that<br />\nweekend and nobody even knew. That there was no TV<br />\nand that everybody ignored Huxley's death was the way I<br />\nwould remember that something had gone wrong.<br />\nAgain, I don't know. Hemingway's death bothered me<br />\nmore, even before everyone started nodding knowingly,<br />\nassuring each other that it was a suicide. I had wanted<br />\nto become part of an American literary culture and was<br />\nhopelessly frustrated that part of that culture could get<br />\naway, one way or another, before I could read all his<br />\nbooks, much less meet him. I was twelve and still going<br />\nto bed at 10 o'clock when Hemingway wrote his final<br />\nstatement on manhood with his shotgun. It amuses me<br />\nthat I must finish this by another 10 o'clock, when<br />\nSloan said he would wake up and take it down to the<br />\nprinters. Hemingway was too virile for Dex.<br />\n\"Now it is all a blur, crepe black and blood and<br />\nmaybe a few faces, not all violence, but all very dead:<br />\nthree Kennedys, three sex symbols, three Mississippi<br />\ncivil rights workers, Lincoln Rockwell, Medgar Evers,<br />\nMartin King, Malcolm X, 40,000 \"American boys\",<br />\nhundreds of thousands of \"oriental human beings\",<br />\nEisenhower and Nehru and Ho and drivers of cars and<br />\nstarving people and on and on and inevitably on.\"<br />\nAnd Sloan's father and my best friend, and three of<br />\nSloan's high school buddies in Vietnam, a few people<br />\nPete Harnik knows, friend's lovers, lover's friends by all<br />\nthe oddities of a sleeping God. I tell you we are as honest<br />\nas each other. I tell you we die by each other in one way<br />\nor another.<br />\nI think it happened this way: In the beginning of<br />\nthis decade, for all purposes as far back as I can go,<br />\nthere started to happen what we then thought of as<br />\nfreak occurrences, incredible things which had never<br />\nhappened to us and/or the world before. Then there<br />\ncame so many of these freak occurrances that soon,<br />\nsometime during the decade, you began to wonder just<br />\nwhat was normal and who was the freak occurrence. I<br />\nthink that I am alive is a freak occurrence--the circumstances are not worth going into\u2014and that is the worst<br />\nfeeling I have had all decade.<br />\n\"Who needs to be reminded of all this and who<br />\nwant to forget? But these were our formative<br />\nnot<br />\ndoes<br />\nyears, the years during which we got our first fuck, the<br />\nyears that you want to remember for all the personal<br />\nthings that happened. You must forget about what<br />\nwent on around you, or at least ignore it: the assassination generation will end up the suicidal generation if it<br />\ndoes not try to forget. That is why we drop, that is why<br />\nwe don't give a damn about the future, that is why we<br />\ndo our best to get laid often. We go to the X movies<br />\nbecause they are about nice things like drugs and sex<br />\nand because the G movies are about war and the American aream ana otner Kinds 01 certain death. We matur-<br />\n<br />\ned surrounded by blood: it has either perverted us or<br />\nsaved our humanity. We have been shocked into the<br />\nsimplicity of shouting j'accuse at the controllers of all<br />\nthis bloodshedding, but we have no idea when and how<br />\nit will all stop. Why should we wish to be a part of a<br />\nworld destroying itself; amid the killing, the natural<br />\ndeath is lost: we shall be grateful just to get the chance.\"<br />\nAs I typed that, I began to think that, perhaps<br />\nbecause of I don't know what, that that paragraph above<br />\nthis one is one of the small enduring things, that the AP<br />\nor UPI might find, that it might make an obscure anthology, that it might be read on a television program about<br />\nour troubled youth and the sometimes ease of their<br />\ndifficult expression. Or it might be shit. Sloan said it<br />\nwas.<br />\nI review it for me:<br />\nFormative years are getting soggy in a Junior High<br />\nDancing class with a girl named Harriet who has overdeveloped breasts for a twelve year old, breasts that<br />\nmight also have pimples on them, like the rest of Harriet,<br />\nbut this is the least of all your shame ridden speculation.<br />\nFormulative years are Drake saying he got laid in Mexico<br />\nwhen he was twelve, an incredible lie. Formulative<br />\n<br />\nyears are reading On the Road and then madly peddling<br />\ntwenty miles on your bicycle just to prove to Kerouac<br />\nthat you're on his side.<br />\nI got laid when I was older at a party;! got raped<br />\nbecause nothing that year happened the way it was<br />\nsupposed to\u2014not even mono. She could have been<br />\nme<br />\nHarriet for all I know. The women who have told<br />\nMost<br />\ns.<br />\ninitiation<br />\ntheir secrets, all claim more pleasant<br />\npeople do. I told my confidant,(there were never more<br />\nI said<br />\nthan six at once). She said it sounded exciting,<br />\nly<br />\nsurprising<br />\nup<br />\ngrew<br />\nshe<br />\nthen<br />\nvicarious,<br />\nbeing<br />\nshe was<br />\nwell. I still think it could have been Harriet.<br />\nWhen dope was still evil we traded it like bubble<br />\nand<br />\ngum cards, looking at it a lot, \"taking\" very little<br />\nhouse,<br />\nGriffen<br />\ndorms,<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nfast.<br />\ntoo<br />\nmuch<br />\nhigh<br />\ngetting<br />\n(this<br />\ndamn you, shall we call him Anonymnity stood up,<br />\nhe<br />\nsaid<br />\nand<br />\nRevolver)<br />\nod<br />\nwas when nobody understo<br />\ndid.<br />\nhe<br />\nand<br />\nwaited<br />\nWe<br />\nwould float across the room.<br />\nWe tried to get laid but sometimes it was like basethe statistics being more fun than doing the<br />\nkeeping<br />\nball,<br />\nthing itself. Even the tedium of being reminded that<br />\nyou were lonely could be made into a game. Sloan<br />\ncame back from Phillie one weekend looking like he<br />\nhadn't gotten it all the way out yet.<br />\nFormative years: I read a lot of good books at<br />\nHopkins. But most were boring as shit.<br />\nOnce Exodus and Spartacus were really good movies. Once Shame would have been hard to understand.<br />\nI think Bob Dylan the most enduring American poet to<br />\nflourish in the decade but only because Leonard Cohen<br />\nbecause virtually no one else with tais a Canadian and<br />\n..<br />\nlent whatever his nationality, is an American poet. Per-<br />\n<br />\nhaps there hasn't been another American poet since<br />\nRobert Ford in the 1870's. But that's my problem.<br />\nLast Formative years: I wrote my first short story<br />\nwhen I was eight years old, the day someone threw a<br />\nrock through the window, though I forget the connection. In a week, I'm leaving Hopkins for the coast to<br />\nwrite the rest of a novel. Here the connection is more<br />\nobvious.<br />\n\"I think that there is only one salvation, and that<br />\nis art. We can be reasonably certain that once something<br />\nhas been transformed into art, the culture has come to<br />\ngrips with it. The horror of the sixties must somehow<br />\nbe transformed through art into the symbolic, into the<br />\nconcrete and the stable; it must be removed from the<br />\nnightmare of memory and put in plain view before us<br />\nall, the ogre pacified.\"<br />\nI think it unprintably sad to bury death in art-Sloan's novel. I think it pointless to look for creativity<br />\nbeyond yourself and those you love\u2014my problem.<br />\nWith a show of hands now, who knows how to<br />\nspeculate on solutions to the problem of death?

The significance of this was generally overlooked, however, in the face of the vast musical breakthroughs made in that region, and the continuing influence of the less politically-oriented English groups.<br />\nSomehow, Jorma Kaukonen's guitar hid Grace Slick's<br />\n\"and I'd rather have my country die for me.\"<br />\nAll this began to change in November, a month,<br />\nwhich saw simultaneous tours of the Airplane and the<br />\nRolling Stones, and the release of new albums by both<br />\n..croups.<br />\nThe Airplane concert was held in College Park on<br />\nthe sixth anniversary of John Kennedy's assassination<br />\nand, like most concerts was atrociously organized.<br />\nUnlike most UM concerts, however, both shows were,<br />\nfilled to overflowing, and unlike most performers, the<br />\nAirplane promised to make up for an hour's wait in t<br />\ncold b.y playing longer. And better.<br />\nThe Volunteer album is art<br />\nthe first song, \"We Can Be<br />\nreprise, \"Volunteers\".

Again<br />\nthe concert's sponsors failed to live up to expectations<br />\nand again it was up to the main performers to salvage an<br />\nup-to-then shoddy production.<br />\nRolling Stones records have always been of exceptionally high caliber. The Stones have been able<br />\nto avoid the vicissitudes of the Beatles (\"I am the<br />\nWalrus\"/\"Hello Goodbye\"), the demise through inflexibility of the Mama's and Papa's and the Doors, the<br />\ngimmicks of Al Kooper, and Dylan's soul-searching lack<br />\nof continuity.<br />\nDespite everything that can be said about the<br />\nStones' records, nothing they produce in the studio can<br />\ncompare with one of their concerts. And, like the Airplane, they were up for a rollicking concert.<br />\nInstead of following their traditional pattern of<br />\nplaying for only forty minutes (which is all that bigname groups seems to consider necessary these days),<br />\nthey started off by putting on a full hour-long show.<br />\nThen, what seemed to be the end, wasn't.<br />\nThe house lights came on and Jagger told the<br />\naudience that since he wasn't the only one there, he<br />\nshouldn't be the only one taking part in the concert,<br />\nand thAticveryone should \"conic on up and start dancin'<br />\nNo one's a-gonna get hurt, are they?\" He<br />\nand<br />\ntaunte<br />\n\"'C'inon, let's have some fun!\"<br />\nwas:,t,o 13- anti 14-year-old audience he was<br />\nt Jagger 'had done it again.

Mick, always leering and taunting,<br />\nmilked it for all it was worth.<br />\nThese type of lyrics are something quite foreign<br />\nto the 1960's. When a song's words were at all considered, they dealt mainly with sex or drugs, and at the<br />\nmost extreme, frustration and social protest. It was a<br />\ndecade whose strongest and harshest condemnations<br />\ncame from the poets: Janis Ian's \"Society's Child,\"<br />\nDylan's \"World War III Blues\" and \"Ballad of a Thin<br />\nMan,\" Simon and Garfunkel's \"Save the Life of My<br />\nChild\" and \"Sounds of Silence,\" Richie Havens'\"Handsome Johnny,\" and the Beatles' \"Eleanor Rigby.\"<br />\nMotown completely copped out until the Supremes finally arose themselves to singing about illegitimacy,<br />\nand the other Black groups, including James Brown, restrained themselves to the concept of people having to<br />\nbe free. Elvis added his bit about starving in the ghet-to,<br />\nand Spanky and Our Gang contributed as a promotion,<br />\n\"Give a Damn.\" Whether our younger brothers and<br />\nsisters believe it or not, the decade of the '60's will go<br />\ndown in history as a period in which the strongest protest song was \"I Cant Get No Satisfaction\"--a song<br />\nwhich deals with sex<br />\nThe change,<br />\nThe Airplane<br />\nis one of the mos<br />\n's in the United<br />\nStates these days:*<br />\nstimated that<br />\nPillow.<br />\n.Volunteers will sel.<br />\nSurrealistic<br />\n....4...,.....<br />\nf.<br />\nBeside.ttt<br />\n.tuIttill<br />\n' contains a<br />\nCrosby-Si<br />\neans,hCwiprasor,s,:,eino<br />\nao.irudsyco<br />\n...,. ,,,.iuti:s.i,,i..,eswatdsoci:<br />\nttaeitrti.,t.nt i-.,h.7<br />\n(.1 ,\u201e. :.,. ,hch<br />\no<br />\n..z.,....a.

When this country runs<br />\na space race with itself, you better know damn straight<br />\nthat it's going to win. Yeah, we beat them to Mars, all<br />\nright. And when Captain Bland got out of the M&M<br />\n(that's the Martian Module) planted the flag, saluted it,<br />\nread from his bible a bit, talked to Nixon, to Agnew's<br />\nwidow, to the Secretaries of State, Defense and Interior,<br />\nto the minority leaders of both houses and to football<br />\nCommissioner Namath, he then looked around him and<br />\nremembered that he had forgotten his famous first<br />\nwords. Well, Bland went back to the M & M,. cot the<br />\nfamous first words out, looked at them for awhile, came<br />\nout onto the Martian surface again, littered it with the<br />\nfamous first words and right before he could say the<br />\nwords, was eaten by an unforeseen difficulty.

That part.<br />\nSloan wrote what this article was originally going to<br />\nbe. He gave it to me at 3:30 or so and went to bed. I<br />\nfinished writing a really poor paper, had some soup and<br />\nlook at this now, as you look at it, but to tell you the<br />\ntruth my mind isn't really on you, the reader. If anything it's on the sun. Sloan says:<br />\n\"The single image that we all shall carry with us<br />\ninto the new decade is the one that was caught, in the<br />\nquaint American fashion, by a home movie camera: the<br />\nskull ofJohn F. Kennedy being fragmented into oblivion<br />\nbeneath an explosion of blood in the back seat of a<br />\nLincoln Continental convertible. The explosion of blood<br />\nin that picture managed to cover the remainder of the<br />\ndecade so that now, at its close, we can remember little<br />\nelse. We can regret only that Haskell Wexler was not<br />\nthere to take a shot, for then, perhaps the image of the<br />\nblood would have been clearer, we might have known<br />\nwhat to expect.\"<br />\nI don't know. I can't say I was bothered by the first<br />\nKennedy assassination at the time--I was more sort of<br />\nnegatively amused. A 15 year old cynic, I thought the<br />\nwhole New Frontier business a lot of PR shit, which a<br />\nlot of it was, and I thought it would probably be more<br />\nexciting to vote for Barry Goldwater who at least flew<br />\njet fighters while the best Kennedy could do was sail his<br />\ndamn yacht with a lot of other rich people.<br />\nI don't know. I remember some commentator saying<br />\nhow it was good that there wasn't any regular TV that<br />\nweekend so that even the youngest child would sense<br />\nthat something was very wrong. Aldous Huxley died that<br />\nweekend and nobody even knew. That there was no TV<br />\nand that everybody ignored Huxley's death was the way I<br />\nwould remember that something had gone wrong.<br />\nAgain, I don't know. Hemingway's death bothered me<br />\nmore, even before everyone started nodding knowingly,<br />\nassuring each other that it was a suicide. I had wanted<br />\nto become part of an American literary culture and was<br />\nhopelessly frustrated that part of that culture could get<br />\naway, one way or another, before I could read all his<br />\nbooks, much less meet him. I was twelve and still going<br />\nto bed at 10 o'clock when Hemingway wrote his final<br />\nstatement on manhood with his shotgun. It amuses me<br />\nthat I must finish this by another 10 o'clock, when<br />\nSloan said he would wake up and take it down to the<br />\nprinters. Hemingway was too virile for Dex.<br />\n\"Now it is all a blur, crepe black and blood and<br />\nmaybe a few faces, not all violence, but all very dead:<br />\nthree Kennedys, three sex symbols, three Mississippi<br />\ncivil rights workers, Lincoln Rockwell, Medgar Evers,<br />\nMartin King, Malcolm X, 40,000 \"American boys\",<br />\nhundreds of thousands of \"oriental human beings\",<br />\nEisenhower and Nehru and Ho and drivers of cars and<br />\nstarving people and on and on and inevitably on.\"<br />\nAnd Sloan's father and my best friend, and three of<br />\nSloan's high school buddies in Vietnam, a few people<br />\nPete Harnik knows, friend's lovers, lover's friends by all<br />\nthe oddities of a sleeping God. I tell you we are as honest<br />\nas each other. I tell you we die by each other in one way<br />\nor another.<br />\nI think it happened this way: In the beginning of<br />\nthis decade, for all purposes as far back as I can go,<br />\nthere started to happen what we then thought of as<br />\nfreak occurrences, incredible things which had never<br />\nhappened to us and/or the world before. Then there<br />\ncame so many of these freak occurrances that soon,<br />\nsometime during the decade, you began to wonder just<br />\nwhat was normal and who was the freak occurrence. I<br />\nthink that I am alive is a freak occurrence--the circumstances are not worth going into\u2014and that is the worst<br />\nfeeling I have had all decade.<br />\n\"Who needs to be reminded of all this and who<br />\nwant to forget? But these were our formative<br />\nnot<br />\ndoes<br />\nyears, the years during which we got our first fuck, the<br />\nyears that you want to remember for all the personal<br />\nthings that happened. You must forget about what<br />\nwent on around you, or at least ignore it: the assassination generation will end up the suicidal generation if it<br />\ndoes not try to forget. That is why we drop, that is why<br />\nwe don't give a damn about the future, that is why we<br />\ndo our best to get laid often. We go to the X movies<br />\nbecause they are about nice things like drugs and sex<br />\nand because the G movies are about war and the American aream ana otner Kinds 01 certain death. We matur-<br /><br />\ned surrounded by blood: it has either perverted us or<br />\nsaved our humanity. We have been shocked into the<br />\nsimplicity of shouting j'accuse at the controllers of all<br />\nthis bloodshedding, but we have no idea when and how<br />\nit will all stop. Why should we wish to be a part of a<br />\nworld destroying itself; amid the killing, the natural<br />\ndeath is lost: we shall be grateful just to get the chance.\"<br />\nAs I typed that, I began to think that, perhaps<br />\nbecause of I don't know what, that that paragraph above<br />\nthis one is one of the small enduring things, that the AP<br />\nor UPI might find, that it might make an obscure anthology, that it might be read on a television program about<br />\nour troubled youth and the sometimes ease of their<br />\ndifficult expression. Or it might be shit. Sloan said it<br />\nwas.<br />\nI review it for me:<br />\nFormative years are getting soggy in a Junior High<br />\nDancing class with a girl named Harriet who has overdeveloped breasts for a twelve year old, breasts that<br />\nmight also have pimples on them, like the rest of Harriet,<br />\nbut this is the least of all your shame ridden speculation.<br />\nFormulative years are Drake saying he got laid in Mexico<br />\nwhen he was twelve, an incredible lie. Formulative<br /><br />\nyears are reading On the Road and then madly peddling<br />\ntwenty miles on your bicycle just to prove to Kerouac<br />\nthat you're on his side.<br />\nI got laid when I was older at a party;! got raped<br />\nbecause nothing that year happened the way it was<br />\nsupposed to\u2014not even mono. She could have been<br />\nme<br />\nHarriet for all I know. The women who have told<br />\nMost<br />\ns.<br />\ninitiation<br />\ntheir secrets, all claim more pleasant<br />\npeople do. I told my confidant,(there were never more<br />\nI said<br />\nthan six at once). She said it sounded exciting,<br />\nly<br />\nsurprising<br />\nup<br />\ngrew<br />\nshe<br />\nthen<br />\nvicarious,<br />\nbeing<br />\nshe was<br />\nwell. I still think it could have been Harriet.<br />\nWhen dope was still evil we traded it like bubble<br />\nand<br />\ngum cards, looking at it a lot, \"taking\" very little<br />\nhouse,<br />\nGriffen<br />\ndorms,<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nfast.<br />\ntoo<br />\nmuch<br />\nhigh<br />\ngetting<br />\n(this<br />\ndamn you, shall we call him Anonymnity stood up,<br />\nhe<br />\nsaid<br />\nand<br />\nRevolver)<br />\nod<br />\nwas when nobody understo<br />\ndid.<br />\nhe<br />\nand<br />\nwaited<br />\nWe<br />\nwould float across the room.<br />\nWe tried to get laid but sometimes it was like basethe statistics being more fun than doing the<br />\nkeeping<br />\nball,<br />\nthing itself. Even the tedium of being reminded that<br />\nyou were lonely could be made into a game. Sloan<br />\ncame back from Phillie one weekend looking like he<br />\nhadn't gotten it all the way out yet.<br />\nFormative years: I read a lot of good books at<br />\nHopkins. But most were boring as shit.<br />\nOnce Exodus and Spartacus were really good movies. Once Shame would have been hard to understand.<br />\nI think Bob Dylan the most enduring American poet to<br />\nflourish in the decade but only because Leonard Cohen<br />\nbecause virtually no one else with tais a Canadian and<br />\n..<br />\nlent whatever his nationality, is an American poet. Per-<br /><br />\nhaps there hasn't been another American poet since<br />\nRobert Ford in the 1870's. But that's my problem.<br />\nLast Formative years: I wrote my first short story<br />\nwhen I was eight years old, the day someone threw a<br />\nrock through the window, though I forget the connection. In a week, I'm leaving Hopkins for the coast to<br />\nwrite the rest of a novel. Here the connection is more<br />\nobvious.<br />\n\"I think that there is only one salvation, and that<br />\nis art. We can be reasonably certain that once something<br />\nhas been transformed into art, the culture has come to<br />\ngrips with it. The horror of the sixties must somehow<br />\nbe transformed through art into the symbolic, into the<br />\nconcrete and the stable; it must be removed from the<br />\nnightmare of memory and put in plain view before us<br />\nall, the ogre pacified.\"<br />\nI think it unprintably sad to bury death in art-Sloan's novel. I think it pointless to look for creativity<br />\nbeyond yourself and those you love\u2014my problem.<br />\nWith a show of hands now, who knows how to<br />\nspeculate on solutions to the problem of death?

But most of<br />\nyou have had quiet and prosperous academic careers. It's<br />\nbeen years since you stumbled across your last undergraduate.<br />\nYes, of course the inflation continued. We had the<br />\nNixon economic miracle, the first depression in recorded<br />\neconomic history during which prices actually rose.

I mean don't you think the<br />\npeople in South America should be protected from the<br />\noutsiders who ferment all this trouble? I mean what do<br />\nyou think the Monroe Doctrine is all about? Admittedly, we do most of our fighting around the United<br />\nFruit plantatons and Rockefeller Oil refineries. But so<br />\nwhat? Doesn't Rockefeller deserve a. break?

When you spend ten billion a year to<br /><br />\nland on Mars, you land on Mars. And let me tell you, the<br />\nRusskies were nowhere in sight. When this country runs<br />\na space race with itself, you better know damn straight<br />\nthat it's going to win. Yeah, we beat them to Mars, all<br />\nright. And when Captain Bland got out of the M&amp;M<br />\n(that's the Martian Module) planted the flag, saluted it,<br />\nread from his bible a bit, talked to Nixon, to Agnew's<br />\nwidow, to the Secretaries of State, Defense and Interior,<br />\nto the minority leaders of both houses and to football<br />\nCommissioner Namath, he then looked around him and<br />\nremembered that he had forgotten his famous first<br />\nwords. Well, Bland went back to the M &amp; M,. cot the<br />\nfamous first words out, looked at them for awhile, came<br />\nout onto the Martian surface again, littered it with the<br />\nfamous first words and right before he could say the<br />\nwords, was eaten by an unforeseen difficulty.
