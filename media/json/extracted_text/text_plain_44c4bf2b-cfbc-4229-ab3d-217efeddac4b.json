Dr Capen, considering the production of trained intelligence, termed<br />\ncolleges and universities war industries as 'necessary as guns and tanks<br />\nand planes and ships.' Besides this<br />\nservice, to the colleges we also owe<br />\n<br />\nfats, he said.<br />\nThe inconsistency which Dr Capen<br />\nattacked was the fact that up to date<br />\nthere had been no organized policy<br />\nadopted toward higher institutions<br />\nof learning. The government agencies 'have put into operation policies<br />\nwhich influence colleges and universities profoundly.' These policies, in<br />\nthe main, have been detrimental, Dr<br />\nCapen believes. Although the colleges are asking nothing for themselves, he pointed out that they must<br />\nshow the serious hindrance to 'their<br />\ncapacity to your a continuing stream<br />\nof trained young people into the<br />\nArmy and Navy.'<br />\nr.

Not only speedy but<br />\nIn Congress<br />\nalso intelligent and farsighted thinking must be applied to the situation. In particular, the Congress must<br />\nconsolidate the government's attitude toward the college<br />\nand university students of draftable age. As Dr Samuel<br />\nP Capen, chancellor of the University of Buffalo,<br />\npointed out in an article in Sunday's New York Times,<br />\n'Up to date the government has adopted no policy toward the higher educational establishments. Different<br />\nparts of the government have put into operation policies<br />\nwhich influence colleges and universities profoundly.<br />\nIn the aggregate these policies have been contradictory<br />\nand disruptive.'<br />\nIn the Congress's debate over the disposal of college students, the whole issue has been perverted by<br />\nthe consideration of college students as a 'class.' The<br />\nargument is that only persons who can afford a college<br />\neducation would\\be exempted from service. The fallacy<br />\nof this argument is apparent in almost any college in the<br />\ncountry; scholarships and grants have made it possible<br />\nfor many students to attend who are definitely not of<br />\nthe 'moneyed class.' If the government were to add subsidies as the Taft bill proposed. the distinction would<br />\nbecome even less valid.<br />\nFurthermore, the consideration of college students<br />\nas a 'class' is ratheio.\u2022 irrelevant to the broader consideration of the need for trained men, no matter from what<br />\nsocial stratum they come. Not only it is necessary to<br />\nleave the colleges free to produce technicians and physicians for the armed services, but it is a dangerous mistake eriprely to eradicate liberal education. The preservation of American culture is an integral part of the preparation for a victory of peace after the war.<br />\nDr Capen says, .`Colleges and universities are not<br />\nconducting businet.\u2014_ as usual. They have speeded up their<br />\nnnerntions tu....nrenare their 0.x\u2014ft for rlirers.nrreAriortion in the war effort in the shortest possible time.'<br />\nIt is essential therefore that the Congress make adequate provision for the colleges and universities to carry<br />\non their important role in the wartime nation at the<br />\nsame time they are providing for effective continuation<br />\nof the armed services. If the Congress fails to make this<br />\nprovision it is leaving its job incomplete and at the same<br />\ntime cancelling much of the effectiveness of the draft<br />\nmeasures it is undertaking.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the past summer the world<br />\nlearned of the death in London of<br />\nFelix Weingartner, and a few weeks<br />\nago Frederick Stock died in Chicago.<br />\nOf all the great conductors these-two<br />\nwere probably the sanest men and<br />\nsoundest musicians. Patrons of symphony orchestras are too easily fooled<br />\nby mountebanks, the conductors with<br />\nthe most highly developed eccentricities and the most articulate press<br />\nagents. That the other great conductors are also great musicians we<br />\nshall not question, but nearly all of<br />\nthem practice the rule that anything<br />\nwill sell in an attractive package.<br />\nOf toe two, Weingartner was unquestionably the greater man. He<br />\nwas a scholar, a musicologist; his<br />\nknowledge was so thorough that<br />\nwhen he conducted Beethoven he<br />\nlived in Beethoven's world. He knew<br />\nthe conventions and practices of every<br />\nmusical epoch; he knew the limitations of the composers and made corrections accordingly, but beyond that<br />\nhe never deviated from the composer's<br />\nwritten instructions. In short, he<br />\nwas a re-creator, and not of that<br />\nbreed of currently popular egomaniacs, the 'interpreters.' His book on<br />\nconducting Beethoven is a revelation<br />\nof brass-tack musical horse sense to<br />\nthe reader who has been fed on the<br />\nnonsense of Charles O'Connell, Deems<br />\nTaylor, Sigmund Spaeth and other<br />\n'critics' and hack annotators.

It was written by the editor-in-chief in answer to LIFE's pictorial account of life among the<br />\nFrench Canadians of the province of<br />\nQuebec. The translation is by James<br />\nApplegate.)<br />\nBy FERNAND JOLICOEUR<br />\nI do not know what can be the<br />\nconception that the editors of the<br />\nabout<br />\nmagazine 'LIFE entertain<br />\njournalism, but I hardly believe that<br />\nthey have a high opinion of their profession. I even wonder if they have<br />\never thought that a journalist should<br />\nfirst be prudent (I speak here of<br />\nthe virtue of prudence) because<br />\nhe is influenced in spite of himself by his own tastes which he<br />\nshould then rectify? It so happens<br />\nthat this principle is such that it is<br />\nstill valuable in the twentieth century.<br />\n<br />\nAccuracy in Journalism<br />\n. In the final count, an article<br />\n<br />\nin a<br />\nnewspaper or magazine is not a play<br />\nwhere one can neglect telling everything except that which can produce<br />\nunity of action. It is, however, what<br />\nthose persons write who take care<br />\nto explain everything even though<br />\nsome of it can destroy the balance<br />\nof their argument. It is no longer<br />\njournalism that they are writing, but<br />\nrhetoric. All of which proves, it may<br />\nbe noted in passing, that there is<br />\nalways a tendency to give art precedence over prudence because it is<br />\neasier to write from one's imagination than it is to make minute research in order to report the truth.<br />\nThe writer of LIFE's article on<br />\nthe French Canadians, the title of<br />\nwhich we have not even bothered to<br />\nremember, seems, at 'first glance and<br />\nto strangers to our province, to have<br />\nbeen given much consideration. It<br />\nseems that here is a serious, efficient<br />\njournalist! He isn't at all like many<br />\n<br />\nof his fellow writers: he reports the<br />\nplace, the situation; he has left a<br />\nbrilliant, active life (enervating and<br />\nenervated like himself) in order to<br />\ngo to waste his time for several days<br />\nin this distant land of Quebec; he has<br />\nmade inquiries in the very place<br />\n(and one gets quite a definite impression that he is very much out<br />\nof his element). He has also taken<br />\npitcures to make his article live; he<br />\nhas taken them while accompanied<br />\nby the most important man, the best<br />\nleader of the 'people,' the priest.<br />\nAfter taking such precautions and<br />\nwith all his digging up of detailed<br />\nnotes, he assumes the right to return<br />\nto tell his countrymen that they<br />\nknow absolutely nothing about the<br />\nFrench Canadians, 'the nicest people<br />\nin the world.' He knows them so<br />\nwell now! He has been so well received in the old province of Quebec,<br />\n'the most unprogressive of the settled provinces.'<br />\n<br />\nMocking Journalist<br />\nBasically, one perceives clearly<br />\nthat the journalist in question is<br />\nmaking fun of us royally. He passed<br />\nan agreeable<br />\nweekend, perhaps,<br />\namong us; now he no longer has any<br />\nother occupation than to amuse his<br />\nreaders at our expense. We must say<br />\nalso that the poor Americans are<br />\nstill less informed than before they<br />\nread such an article. But why should<br />\nhe worry about whether he told the<br />\ntruth or not? He works for his<br />\nmagazine, he does not work for the<br />\ntruth! His boss gives him a salary,<br />\nand the truth gives him a headache.<br />\nHe likes his boss very much, and the<br />\nlatter likes his public even more.<br />\nAfter all, the readers of the twentieth century, of the century to which<br />\nwe are 'essentially foreign' (!), like<br />\nnothing better than good blarney on<br />\nany subject whatever.

The trouble seems to lie with<br />\nthe fact that the Hopkins first team<br />\nruns off plays against the scrubs in<br />\npractice, but rarely, if ever, gets a<br />\nchance to practice defensive tactics.<br />\nI'd say that a few scrimmages might<br />\nwell be spent in allowing the second<br />\nteam to run plays off against the<br />\nvarsity eleven. What say, Mr Mal,<br />\ndefense is half the game? Defensive<br />\npractice might also give the boys a<br />\nchance to learn that the opposition's<br />\npasses should be either intercepted<br />\nor knocked down, but certainly never<br />\nbe sent bounding up into the air and<br />\ninvariably into the hands of an opponent.<br />\n<br />\nThe third game of the soccer season will see Hopkins playing Gettysburg at 2 tomorrow afternoon at<br />\nHomewood.

To get<br />\ndown to cases, anyone can go in a<br />\nrecord store and ask to compare<br />\nKoussevitzky's version of the plumcaglia in Brahma' fourth symphony<br />\nwith Weingartner's. Here the emphasis of the composer is on structure, yet the Bostop conductor manages to turn it into 1a swirling, sensuous piece of Dionysian revelry which<br />\ncharms the ears and has the same<br />\nsort of emotional and intellectual appeal as the last part of the William<br />\nTell overture; and the .formal content, which Brahms worked over with<br />\nevident care and love is completely<br />\nlost. Weingartner, conducting an<br />\ninferior orchestra, gets a performance<br />\nin which the formal beauties of the<br />\nwork are always uppermost, and at<br />\nthe same time gets a tone which is<br />\ncrisp and pleasing. Koussevitzky,<br />\nof course, isn't always bad. When<br />\nplaying Debussy, for instance, or the<br />\nless frantic parts of Tchaikovsky, he<br />\nis superb; but Weingartner, with the<br />\nmore versatile and better-trained<br />\nmind, was quite as capable of turning out a whoopsydaisy bacchariale<br />\nwhen a composer called for it.<br />\n<br />\nThe Younger Conductors<br />\nOf the younger conductors, that is,<br />\nthose from 40 to 55, only Ormandy<br />\nand Rodzinski show any promise of<br />\npreserving the practices of their profession in the tradition of Weingartner and Stock; and even Ormandy,<br />\nwinning a public, after being at the<br />\nhead of the Philadelphia Orchestra<br />\nfor five or six seasons.

Besides this<br />\nservice, to the colleges we also owe<br /><br />\nfats, he said.<br />\nThe inconsistency which Dr Capen<br />\nattacked was the fact that up to date<br />\nthere had been no organized policy<br />\nadopted toward higher institutions<br />\nof learning. The government agencies 'have put into operation policies<br />\nwhich influence colleges and universities profoundly.' These policies, in<br />\nthe main, have been detrimental, Dr<br />\nCapen believes.

Not only speedy but<br />\nIn Congress<br />\nalso intelligent and farsighted thinking must be applied to the situation. In particular, the Congress must<br />\nconsolidate the government's attitude toward the college<br />\nand university students of draftable age. As Dr Samuel<br />\nP Capen, chancellor of the University of Buffalo,<br />\npointed out in an article in Sunday's New York Times,<br />\n'Up to date the government has adopted no policy toward the higher educational establishments. Different<br />\nparts of the government have put into operation policies<br />\nwhich influence colleges and universities profoundly.<br />\nIn the aggregate these policies have been contradictory<br />\nand disruptive.'<br />\nIn the Congress's debate over the disposal of college students, the whole issue has been perverted by<br />\nthe consideration of college students as a 'class.' The<br />\nargument is that only persons who can afford a college<br />\neducation would\\be exempted from service. The fallacy<br />\nof this argument is apparent in almost any college in the<br />\ncountry; scholarships and grants have made it possible<br />\nfor many students to attend who are definitely not of<br />\nthe 'moneyed class.' If the government were to add subsidies as the Taft bill proposed. the distinction would<br />\nbecome even less valid.<br />\nFurthermore, the consideration of college students<br />\nas a 'class' is ratheio.\u2022 irrelevant to the broader consideration of the need for trained men, no matter from what<br />\nsocial stratum they come. Not only it is necessary to<br />\nleave the colleges free to produce technicians and physicians for the armed services, but it is a dangerous mistake eriprely to eradicate liberal education. The preservation of American culture is an integral part of the preparation for a victory of peace after the war.<br />\nDr Capen says, .`Colleges and universities are not<br />\nconducting businet.\u2014_ as usual. They have speeded up their<br />\nnnerntions tu....nrenare their 0.x\u2014ft for rlirers.nrreAriortion in the war effort in the shortest possible time.'<br />\nIt is essential therefore that the Congress make adequate provision for the colleges and universities to carry<br />\non their important role in the wartime nation at the<br />\nsame time they are providing for effective continuation<br />\nof the armed services. If the Congress fails to make this<br />\nprovision it is leaving its job incomplete and at the same<br />\ntime cancelling much of the effectiveness of the draft<br />\nmeasures it is undertaking.<br /><br />\nDuring the past summer the world<br />\nlearned of the death in London of<br />\nFelix Weingartner, and a few weeks<br />\nago Frederick Stock died in Chicago.<br />\nOf all the great conductors these-two<br />\nwere probably the sanest men and<br />\nsoundest musicians. Patrons of symphony orchestras are too easily fooled<br />\nby mountebanks, the conductors with<br />\nthe most highly developed eccentricities and the most articulate press<br />\nagents. That the other great conductors are also great musicians we<br />\nshall not question, but nearly all of<br />\nthem practice the rule that anything<br />\nwill sell in an attractive package.<br />\nOf toe two, Weingartner was unquestionably the greater man. He<br />\nwas a scholar, a musicologist; his<br />\nknowledge was so thorough that<br />\nwhen he conducted Beethoven he<br />\nlived in Beethoven's world. He knew<br />\nthe conventions and practices of every<br />\nmusical epoch; he knew the limitations of the composers and made corrections accordingly, but beyond that<br />\nhe never deviated from the composer's<br />\nwritten instructions. In short, he<br />\nwas a re-creator, and not of that<br />\nbreed of currently popular egomaniacs, the 'interpreters.' His book on<br />\nconducting Beethoven is a revelation<br />\nof brass-tack musical horse sense to<br />\nthe reader who has been fed on the<br />\nnonsense of Charles O'Connell, Deems<br />\nTaylor, Sigmund Spaeth and other<br />\n'critics' and hack annotators.

The translation is by James<br />\nApplegate.)<br />\nBy FERNAND JOLICOEUR<br />\nI do not know what can be the<br />\nconception that the editors of the<br />\nabout<br />\nmagazine 'LIFE entertain<br />\njournalism, but I hardly believe that<br />\nthey have a high opinion of their profession. I even wonder if they have<br />\never thought that a journalist should<br />\nfirst be prudent (I speak here of<br />\nthe virtue of prudence) because<br />\nhe is influenced in spite of himself by his own tastes which he<br />\nshould then rectify? It so happens<br />\nthat this principle is such that it is<br />\nstill valuable in the twentieth century.<br /><br />\nAccuracy in Journalism<br />\n. In the final count, an article<br /><br />\nin a<br />\nnewspaper or magazine is not a play<br />\nwhere one can neglect telling everything except that which can produce<br />\nunity of action. It is, however, what<br />\nthose persons write who take care<br />\nto explain everything even though<br />\nsome of it can destroy the balance<br />\nof their argument. It is no longer<br />\njournalism that they are writing, but<br />\nrhetoric. All of which proves, it may<br />\nbe noted in passing, that there is<br />\nalways a tendency to give art precedence over prudence because it is<br />\neasier to write from one's imagination than it is to make minute research in order to report the truth.<br />\nThe writer of LIFE's article on<br />\nthe French Canadians, the title of<br />\nwhich we have not even bothered to<br />\nremember, seems, at 'first glance and<br />\nto strangers to our province, to have<br />\nbeen given much consideration. It<br />\nseems that here is a serious, efficient<br />\njournalist! He isn't at all like many<br /><br />\nof his fellow writers: he reports the<br />\nplace, the situation; he has left a<br />\nbrilliant, active life (enervating and<br />\nenervated like himself) in order to<br />\ngo to waste his time for several days<br />\nin this distant land of Quebec; he has<br />\nmade inquiries in the very place<br />\n(and one gets quite a definite impression that he is very much out<br />\nof his element). He has also taken<br />\npitcures to make his article live; he<br />\nhas taken them while accompanied<br />\nby the most important man, the best<br />\nleader of the 'people,' the priest.<br />\nAfter taking such precautions and<br />\nwith all his digging up of detailed<br />\nnotes, he assumes the right to return<br />\nto tell his countrymen that they<br />\nknow absolutely nothing about the<br />\nFrench Canadians, 'the nicest people<br />\nin the world.' He knows them so<br />\nwell now! He has been so well received in the old province of Quebec,<br />\n'the most unprogressive of the settled provinces.'<br /><br />\nMocking Journalist<br />\nBasically, one perceives clearly<br />\nthat the journalist in question is<br />\nmaking fun of us royally.

We must say<br />\nalso that the poor Americans are<br />\nstill less informed than before they<br />\nread such an article. But why should<br />\nhe worry about whether he told the<br />\ntruth or not? He works for his<br />\nmagazine, he does not work for the<br />\ntruth!

To get<br />\ndown to cases, anyone can go in a<br />\nrecord store and ask to compare<br />\nKoussevitzky's version of the plumcaglia in Brahma' fourth symphony<br />\nwith Weingartner's. Here the emphasis of the composer is on structure, yet the Bostop conductor manages to turn it into 1a swirling, sensuous piece of Dionysian revelry which<br />\ncharms the ears and has the same<br />\nsort of emotional and intellectual appeal as the last part of the William<br />\nTell overture; and the .formal content, which Brahms worked over with<br />\nevident care and love is completely<br />\nlost. Weingartner, conducting an<br />\ninferior orchestra, gets a performance<br />\nin which the formal beauties of the<br />\nwork are always uppermost, and at<br />\nthe same time gets a tone which is<br />\ncrisp and pleasing. Koussevitzky,<br />\nof course, isn't always bad. When<br />\nplaying Debussy, for instance, or the<br />\nless frantic parts of Tchaikovsky, he<br />\nis superb; but Weingartner, with the<br />\nmore versatile and better-trained<br />\nmind, was quite as capable of turning out a whoopsydaisy bacchariale<br />\nwhen a composer called for it.<br /><br />\nThe Younger Conductors<br />\nOf the younger conductors, that is,<br />\nthose from 40 to 55, only Ormandy<br />\nand Rodzinski show any promise of<br />\npreserving the practices of their profession in the tradition of Weingartner and Stock; and even Ormandy,<br />\nwinning a public, after being at the<br />\nhead of the Philadelphia Orchestra<br />\nfor five or six seasons.
