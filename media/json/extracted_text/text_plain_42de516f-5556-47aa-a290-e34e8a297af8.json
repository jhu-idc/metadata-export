Mr. Schaal's budget situation<br />\nhas been considerably relieved by campus contributions to that extent and amicable relations between<br />\nthe \"Y\" and the students have been materially<br />\nstrengthened. It is estimated that, with more efficient<br />\nmanagement of Levering Hall affairs, according to<br />\nMr. Schaal's current budget, the cash received so far<br />\ncan be made equivalent to former larger collections.<br />\nThere is nothing objectionable about the present<br />\nsystem of financing Levering. The Y. M. C. A. offers<br />\nus a building for use unhampered by any University<br />\nsurveillance or interference. Consequently it cannot<br />\nbe expected that the University should contribute<br />\nlargely to its support. We are afforded a sort of<br />\nhaven and it is entirely fitting that we should back up<br />\nour appreciation with cold cash. That's the way of<br />\nthe world.<br />\n<br />\nIs the athletic department slow on comprehension?<br />\nThe gentlemen of that illustrious connection will say<br />\nbaldly that they need the money they can get from<br />\nsuch a game, but we can't respect a group which is<br />\nwilling to sell the personal safety of its teams.<br />\nHowever, let's leave that out for the present;<br />\nlet's just look at the \"no money\" side. First, we find<br />\nthat a complete set of football pants, jerseys, helmets,<br />\nor stockings has not been purchased for so long that<br />\nthe team looks like a sand-lot conglomeration and is<br />\nnot adequately protected. Yet in the five years from<br />\n1927-32 the athletic department turned over $20,000<br />\nto the University.<br />\nSecond, the locker rooms, visiting teams' and<br />\nhome team's, are disgraceful in equipment, and we<br />\ndare any holder of an A. A. card to ask for a towel<br />\nand locker\u2014it's a capital offense, although it's a privilege going with the card. Yet $20,000 profit was<br />\nmade in five years.<br />\nThird, one of the best line coaches and lacrosse<br />\ncoaches we've ever had \u2014 Gardner Mallonee \u2014 was<br />\ndropped, his three- or four-hundred dollar fee being<br />\ntoo much. Yet we made twenty thousand dollars in<br />\nfive years.<br />\nFourth, the basketball team hasn't had any uniforms, except those given by a man, individually, four<br />\nyears ago. There's no money for a training table for<br />\nthe squads; there's no money for parallel bars and<br />\nrings at the Field; there's no money\u2014so we schedule<br />\nheavy football machines. There's no money, yet we<br />\ncleared $20,000 in five years.<br />\nThe President claims that intercollegiate sports<br />\nare bad; he objects to charging admission to games<br />\nand hiring professional coaches. He believes in sports<br />\nfor all, and we're not sure he isn't right. Yet the<br />\nadministration continues to take any and all profits<br />\nof our present disgraceful system; it needs the<br />\nmoney; amen.<br />\nNor would it be so bad if the powers that be<br />\nwould be frank and not cloak their actions in such<br />\nsecrecy. They needn't think they're getting away with<br />\nit when the athletic department won't give out its<br />\nbudget; when the administration offices \"know absolutely nothing about it\" when you start to ask two<br />\nconsecutive questions; and when the dimmest wits<br />\non the campus are left to jump to whatever conclusions they will.<br />\n<br />\nNotice<br />\nCarson G. Frailey, who was elected to Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa last week, is junior manager of football, vice-president of the Musical Club, and has been<br />\nclass treasurer for two years.

This European<br />\nproblem consists of Germany alone<br />\n\u2014a nation whose people, in Dr.<br />\nZimmern's words,\"run to extremes,<br />\n... lack common sense . .. have no<br />\nsense of reality ... and who are politically still in the 16th century.\"<br />\nBecause of this, certain factors,<br />\nsuch as the Versailles Treaty, have<br />\nmade Germany angry and resentful<br />\ntoward her former enemies, and,<br />\nwhen the 60,000,000 Germans who<br />\ncompose the most powerful nation<br />\nin Europe are in this frame of mind,<br />\nthe situation is very grave indeed.<br />\nGermany has a preponderance<br />\nover the rest of Europe in her industrial mobilization, population,<br />\nand natural resources, and she is<br />\nnot to be held down in her demands.<br />\nAnd, said Dr. Zimmern, as no compromise can be manageable with<br />\nGermany's present egocentric government and population, it is up to<br />\nthe rest of the world to ameliorate<br />\nthese conditions by international cooperation.<br />\nGoes To Root Of Trouble<br />\n<br />\nIn his second lecture, entitled<br />\n\"The Problem of Nationality\", Dr.<br />\nZimmern went more deeply into the<br />\nrelations of Amerira with Europe,<br />\nshowing that the German problem<br />\ncan be solved if Europe and America unite in an effort to do so. He<br />\ndeclared that this united effort can<br />\nbe accomplished, in spite of the<br />\nfundamental differences between the<br />\ncultures and peoples of the two continents.<br />\nFor, he said, there are fundamental differences: Europe lives in a<br />\nworld of time, America in a world<br />\nof space. The cultures are different\u2014\"America is a country of environment,Europe one of tradition\".<br />\nEurope speaks a different political<br />\nand cultural language: \"Americans<br />\nthink in terms of economics and of<br />\nbusiness,\" he said, \"while Europeans think in terms of politics and<br />\npower.\" However, Dr. Zimmern<br />\nexpressed the belief that America<br />\nand Europe can unite, in spite of<br />\nthese differences, and must do so if<br />\na solution to the problem is to be<br />\nobtained; for, he said, \"Europe and<br />\nthe United States must come together in building up a common<br />\nsense of law.\"<br />\n<br />\nsociation met in New York recently<br />\nfor the purpose of revising some of<br />\nthe present provisions.<br />\nMiller<br />\nMoore, of Pennsylvania, was elected<br />\npresident for the coming year, while<br />\nDouglas Turnbull, a former Hopkins lacrosse star, was appointed a<br />\nmember of the association's executive board.<br />\nCoach Van Orman attended the<br />\ngathering in New York and was favorably impressed with the changes<br />\nmade. Probably the most important<br />\nof these is the enlarging of the playing field to 90 yards in length and<br />\n60 yards in width.

Mr. Schaal's budget situation<br />\nhas been considerably relieved by campus contributions to that extent and amicable relations between<br />\nthe \"Y\" and the students have been materially<br />\nstrengthened. It is estimated that, with more efficient<br />\nmanagement of Levering Hall affairs, according to<br />\nMr. Schaal's current budget, the cash received so far<br />\ncan be made equivalent to former larger collections.<br />\nThere is nothing objectionable about the present<br />\nsystem of financing Levering. The Y. M. C. A. offers<br />\nus a building for use unhampered by any University<br />\nsurveillance or interference. Consequently it cannot<br />\nbe expected that the University should contribute<br />\nlargely to its support. We are afforded a sort of<br />\nhaven and it is entirely fitting that we should back up<br />\nour appreciation with cold cash. That's the way of<br />\nthe world.<br /><br />\nIs the athletic department slow on comprehension?<br />\nThe gentlemen of that illustrious connection will say<br />\nbaldly that they need the money they can get from<br />\nsuch a game, but we can't respect a group which is<br />\nwilling to sell the personal safety of its teams.<br />\nHowever, let's leave that out for the present;<br />\nlet's just look at the \"no money\" side. First, we find<br />\nthat a complete set of football pants, jerseys, helmets,<br />\nor stockings has not been purchased for so long that<br />\nthe team looks like a sand-lot conglomeration and is<br />\nnot adequately protected. Yet in the five years from<br />\n1927-32 the athletic department turned over $20,000<br />\nto the University.<br />\nSecond, the locker rooms, visiting teams' and<br />\nhome team's, are disgraceful in equipment, and we<br />\ndare any holder of an A.

Yet we made twenty thousand dollars in<br />\nfive years.<br />\nFourth, the basketball team hasn't had any uniforms, except those given by a man, individually, four<br />\nyears ago. There's no money for a training table for<br />\nthe squads; there's no money for parallel bars and<br />\nrings at the Field; there's no money\u2014so we schedule<br />\nheavy football machines. There's no money, yet we<br />\ncleared $20,000 in five years.<br />\nThe President claims that intercollegiate sports<br />\nare bad; he objects to charging admission to games<br />\nand hiring professional coaches. He believes in sports<br />\nfor all, and we're not sure he isn't right. Yet the<br />\nadministration continues to take any and all profits<br />\nof our present disgraceful system; it needs the<br />\nmoney; amen.<br />\nNor would it be so bad if the powers that be<br />\nwould be frank and not cloak their actions in such<br />\nsecrecy. They needn't think they're getting away with<br />\nit when the athletic department won't give out its<br />\nbudget; when the administration offices \"know absolutely nothing about it\" when you start to ask two<br />\nconsecutive questions; and when the dimmest wits<br />\non the campus are left to jump to whatever conclusions they will.<br /><br />\nNotice<br />\nCarson G.

But the Hopkins is<br />\nin a state of economic prostration: that's all the administration can think, hear, or talk about, and, consequently, every other issue is inferior to it.<br />\nOur kick is plainly this: there is no material<br />\navailable for good football squads here; Coach Van<br />\nOrman does not have sufficient assistance in training<br />\nthe men; and yet we must meet football teams having<br />\nsubsidized athletes and being, in practically every respect, able to do just what they want to Blue Jay<br />\nsquads.
