It is extremely difficult to find<br />\nany logical reason for the continuance of this practice, unless it be considered as a means of penalizing men who miss more than the usual<br />\namount of classes. Roll-call, then, constitutes a threat which the professor holds over men whom he is supposed to be leading along the<br />\npath of enlightenment. If the instructor is to be considered as a person whose duty it is to force the men under him to perform disagreeable tasks, then roll-call certainly is of assistance to him. But if the<br />\ninstructor be regarded as a guide to men who are students like himself,<br />\nwith the distinction that they are less experienced only, then roll-call<br />\nis an anomaly.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nThe views of one of our professors on the subject of roll-call are<br />\nworthy of being quoted. \"These lectures are being given three times<br />\na week,\" said he, \"and if you choose to absent yourself from them it<br />\nis your loss, not mine. You. will derive more from the course by attending the lectures regularly, but if you do not attend and still show<br />\nby your examination that you have comprehended the substance of the<br />\ncourse, I shall pass you regardless of how often you have attended<br />\nclass.\" His viewpoint is that each man should decide for himself the<br />\nbest way of assimilating the material offered in his course. Consequently if the student thinks* he .can spend the hours of lecture more<br />\nprofitably in some other place, he should do so.<br />\nWe believe that that is the correct attitude. Each professor offers<br />\ncertain things in his lectures. If his students choose not to take advantage of them, that is their business, not his. The threat of punishment<br />\nthat roll-call implies is an abomination. College men are no longer<br />\nchildren and they should not be treated as such. Imagine a college<br />\nprofessor opening his first lecture with the following words: \"Boys,<br />\nif you come here on time three days a week and sit very quietly for<br />\nfifty minutes each day, I shall help you to get a nice, shiny, brand new<br />\ndegree!\" Of course, no professor ever used exactly those words, but<br />\nmany imply them every time they call the roll.<br />\n<br />\nWHEN IS A UNIVERSITY NOT A<br />\nUNIVERSITY?<br />\nPuns are generally considered the lowest form of wit and riddles<br />\nare not much better. But the riddle \"When is a university not a university ?\" is a very illuminating one.<br />\nThe answer to the riddle presupposes a knowledge of the difference<br />\nbetween a college and a university. A college is an institution of learning in which one field of knowledge only is examined. We have,<br />\ntherefore, engineering colleges, medical colleges, agricultural colleges,<br />\ncolleges of law and so on. A university, on the other hand, is a group'<br />\nof colleges, all working in harmony. It is an institution in which a<br />\nstudent may derive instruction in many branches of learning. A university is not a university when it is a group of colleges, not working<br />\nin harmony.<br />\nThe Business Economics School of the Johns Hopkins University<br />\naffords a perfect example.<br />\n<br />\nPhone: Vernon 6198<br />\n<br />\nBy RICHARD G.

Rice ($5.00) $2.50.<br />\n<br />\nIt is in the consideration of this problem that I find a real interest attaches to the division of the college into schools of engineering, arts, and sciences, etc. The division between engineering<br />\nand business economics is a very right one, and so is the division<br />\nof arts and sciences from either of these. But in the latter instance<br />\nthe division has a different, if not more fundamental, aspect than<br />\nin the former; for as between economics and engineering, the<br />\nchoice is between one profession, or, if you will, one trade and<br />\nanother, and the differences between their schools are the differences between two technical training courses, while the distinction<br />\nbetween either of them and the A. B. School is the distinction between education for a definite occupation or pursuit and education for want for lack of a better word we must call \"culture.\"<br />\nI cannot but regard the union of these divergent purposes under the inclusive name of \"college\" or \"university\" as unfortunate,<br />\nbecause there has grown up not only in the lay mind, but among<br />\nstudents themselves, a consequent confusion of the aims of the<br />\ntwo classes of institutions. To the great mass of fathers the reason for sending Johnny to college is, I believe, to enable him to<br />\ngrab more dollars than he otherwise could, and to perform the<br />\ngrabbing process under conditions of greater comfort and esteem<br />\nthan otherwise possible. To attain this end, some study law, some<br />\nmedicine, some engineering, and so on, but the common motive is<br />\neconomic, and the choice between the various possibilities is based<br />\non the relative financial opportunities the respective fields offer,<br />\nthe experiences and accessibility of suitable education, and the<br />\nnatural preference of the student.<br />\nStill another course open to monetarily ambitious is a general arts education on the assumption, right or wrong, that it will<br />\nincrease his earning power when he enters business. I have no<br />\nfault to find with the financial incentive. It is surely everyone's<br />\nresponsibility to support himself efficiently, and to that end he<br />\nought to prepare himself thoroughly in the field he chooses if<br />\nhis interest in that field per se is not great, his desire for success<br />\nwill artificially stimulate it and thus assure honest efforts at good<br />\nresults.<br />\nAfter all, however, all specialization is training in a trade,<br />\neither purely for gain or for love of the subject; and there remains a class of people who, fortunately or unfortunately, have<br />\nno specific interest, but who want a serious though more general<br />\nand diversified acquaintance with some provinces of knowledge.<br />\nTo fill the needs of such people the \"cultural\" education of the<br />\narts and sciences colleges has its legitimate place in the school system. The general confusion in the popular mind of this type of<br />\neducation with the technical kind results from the unhappy correlation of these institutions in practice, and is responsible for the<br />\nnaive assumption that all students are studying \"to be something\"<br />\nand that all education must have a practical; i. e., dollars and<br />\ncents, value.<br />\nTo some people, of course, such a concept is completely<br />\nalien, but surely the emancipation of the general public from this<br />\ndelusion would be of inestimable service in helping it to understand and sympathize with the work of the serious but disinterested college of the much bedogged cultural stamp.<br />\n<br />\nFORD<br />\n<br />\nNEW<br />\n<br />\nUSED<br />\n<br />\nAutomobiles<br />\n<br />\nTHE BACKUS MOTOR COMPANY<br />\n10-20 E.

B.'s and the<br />\nengineers.<br />\nThese facts may, as I suggested at the outset, be of no consequence, but they do open up a field of speculation that might<br />\nprove beneficial. It is not a new question, but it is one that changing customs and shifting viewpoints keep fresh. The question is<br />\nthe very fundamental one of the purpose of college education.<br />\n<br />\nHUGO WEISBERGER<br />\n<br />\n913 N. CHARLES STREET, BALTIMORE, MD.<br />\n<br />\nThe chance arrangement that annoys me is the division of a<br />\nnominally unified undergraduate body into three schools\u2014Arts<br />\nand Sciences, Engineering, and Business Economics, not to add<br />\nthe unclassified few who graduate with the degree of Bachelor of<br />\nScience in Chemistry. The necessity of segregating the students<br />\naccording to their fields of study, insofar as these fields are general<br />\nand quite distinct, is clear enough. The present plan, it seems to<br />\nme, doesn't quite preserve the proper coordination between these<br />\nparts. In the first place, the School of Business Economics is so<br />\nsmall that it has no locale and almost no personnel of its own, but<br />\nseems rather to be a minor appendage of the Economics department of the graduate school. Its most important staff members<br />\nare grouped around the economics library just as are the academic<br />\nteachers about the respective libraries, a circumstance which<br />\nwould seem to class the Economics School as a branch of the<br />\nArts College coordinate with history and biology, rather than a<br />\nseparate and independent school coodinate with the Arts College itself.<br />\nSecond, the dean of Arts and Sciences ought to have no more<br />\ndignity and prominence than the dean of Engineering or\u2014if<br />\nthere was one\u2014of Business Economics. But as a matter of fact<br />\nthe word \"dean\" as it is commonly used is taken to refer to the<br />\ndean of Arts and Sciences unless further specified. NEWS-LETTER<br />\nreporters, seeking weighty opinions on matters of interest to students, inentably neglect the second floor of M. E. for the basement of Remsen. When \"the dean\" addresses the freshmen each<br />\nfall, there is never any doubt as to which dean is meant. And<br />\nto round it all off, in the College of Arts and Sciences the graduate<br />\nand undergraduate work is geographically so commingled that the<br />\nunfortunate, if undeserving undergraduate are left without a<br />\nplace to call their own.<br />\n<br />\nBUSINESS DEPARTMENT<br />\n<br />\nAdvertising Manager<br />\nSADLER ROBERTSON, '3.1<br />\n<br />\nABOUT EDUCATION<br />\n<br />\nTHE UNITED RAILWAYS AND ELECTRIC CO.<br />\nof Baltimore<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n1855 \u2022 SEVENTY-FIFTH<br />\n<br />\nANNIVERSARY \u2022 1930<br />\n<br />\nWatering 87,000<br />\nHorses<br />\nOn Horseshoe Lake near Oklahoma City, in<br />\na businesslike,compact building,87,000 horses<br />\n(figuratively speaking) are stabled ... nearly<br />\nthree for every family in Oklahoma City.

It is extremely difficult to find<br />\nany logical reason for the continuance of this practice, unless it be considered as a means of penalizing men who miss more than the usual<br />\namount of classes. Roll-call, then, constitutes a threat which the professor holds over men whom he is supposed to be leading along the<br />\npath of enlightenment. If the instructor is to be considered as a person whose duty it is to force the men under him to perform disagreeable tasks, then roll-call certainly is of assistance to him. But if the<br />\ninstructor be regarded as a guide to men who are students like himself,<br />\nwith the distinction that they are less experienced only, then roll-call<br />\nis an anomaly.<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nThe views of one of our professors on the subject of roll-call are<br />\nworthy of being quoted. \"These lectures are being given three times<br />\na week,\" said he, \"and if you choose to absent yourself from them it<br />\nis your loss, not mine. You. will derive more from the course by attending the lectures regularly, but if you do not attend and still show<br />\nby your examination that you have comprehended the substance of the<br />\ncourse, I shall pass you regardless of how often you have attended<br />\nclass.\" His viewpoint is that each man should decide for himself the<br />\nbest way of assimilating the material offered in his course. Consequently if the student thinks* he .can spend the hours of lecture more<br />\nprofitably in some other place, he should do so.<br />\nWe believe that that is the correct attitude. Each professor offers<br />\ncertain things in his lectures. If his students choose not to take advantage of them, that is their business, not his. The threat of punishment<br />\nthat roll-call implies is an abomination. College men are no longer<br />\nchildren and they should not be treated as such. Imagine a college<br />\nprofessor opening his first lecture with the following words: \"Boys,<br />\nif you come here on time three days a week and sit very quietly for<br />\nfifty minutes each day, I shall help you to get a nice, shiny, brand new<br />\ndegree!\" Of course, no professor ever used exactly those words, but<br />\nmany imply them every time they call the roll.<br /><br />\nWHEN IS A UNIVERSITY NOT A<br />\nUNIVERSITY?<br />\nPuns are generally considered the lowest form of wit and riddles<br />\nare not much better. But the riddle \"When is a university not a university ?\" is a very illuminating one.<br />\nThe answer to the riddle presupposes a knowledge of the difference<br />\nbetween a college and a university. A college is an institution of learning in which one field of knowledge only is examined. We have,<br />\ntherefore, engineering colleges, medical colleges, agricultural colleges,<br />\ncolleges of law and so on. A university, on the other hand, is a group'<br />\nof colleges, all working in harmony. It is an institution in which a<br />\nstudent may derive instruction in many branches of learning. A university is not a university when it is a group of colleges, not working<br />\nin harmony.<br />\nThe Business Economics School of the Johns Hopkins University<br />\naffords a perfect example.<br /><br />\nPhone: Vernon 6198<br /><br />\nBy RICHARD G.

Rice ($5.00) $2.50.<br /><br />\nIt is in the consideration of this problem that I find a real interest attaches to the division of the college into schools of engineering, arts, and sciences, etc. The division between engineering<br />\nand business economics is a very right one, and so is the division<br />\nof arts and sciences from either of these. But in the latter instance<br />\nthe division has a different, if not more fundamental, aspect than<br />\nin the former; for as between economics and engineering, the<br />\nchoice is between one profession, or, if you will, one trade and<br />\nanother, and the differences between their schools are the differences between two technical training courses, while the distinction<br />\nbetween either of them and the A. B. School is the distinction between education for a definite occupation or pursuit and education for want for lack of a better word we must call \"culture.\"<br />\nI cannot but regard the union of these divergent purposes under the inclusive name of \"college\" or \"university\" as unfortunate,<br />\nbecause there has grown up not only in the lay mind, but among<br />\nstudents themselves, a consequent confusion of the aims of the<br />\ntwo classes of institutions. To the great mass of fathers the reason for sending Johnny to college is, I believe, to enable him to<br />\ngrab more dollars than he otherwise could, and to perform the<br />\ngrabbing process under conditions of greater comfort and esteem<br />\nthan otherwise possible. To attain this end, some study law, some<br />\nmedicine, some engineering, and so on, but the common motive is<br />\neconomic, and the choice between the various possibilities is based<br />\non the relative financial opportunities the respective fields offer,<br />\nthe experiences and accessibility of suitable education, and the<br />\nnatural preference of the student.<br />\nStill another course open to monetarily ambitious is a general arts education on the assumption, right or wrong, that it will<br />\nincrease his earning power when he enters business. I have no<br />\nfault to find with the financial incentive. It is surely everyone's<br />\nresponsibility to support himself efficiently, and to that end he<br />\nought to prepare himself thoroughly in the field he chooses if<br />\nhis interest in that field per se is not great, his desire for success<br />\nwill artificially stimulate it and thus assure honest efforts at good<br />\nresults.<br />\nAfter all, however, all specialization is training in a trade,<br />\neither purely for gain or for love of the subject; and there remains a class of people who, fortunately or unfortunately, have<br />\nno specific interest, but who want a serious though more general<br />\nand diversified acquaintance with some provinces of knowledge.<br />\nTo fill the needs of such people the \"cultural\" education of the<br />\narts and sciences colleges has its legitimate place in the school system. The general confusion in the popular mind of this type of<br />\neducation with the technical kind results from the unhappy correlation of these institutions in practice, and is responsible for the<br />\nnaive assumption that all students are studying \"to be something\"<br />\nand that all education must have a practical; i. e., dollars and<br />\ncents, value.<br />\nTo some people, of course, such a concept is completely<br />\nalien, but surely the emancipation of the general public from this<br />\ndelusion would be of inestimable service in helping it to understand and sympathize with the work of the serious but disinterested college of the much bedogged cultural stamp.<br /><br />\nFORD<br /><br />\nNEW<br /><br />\nUSED<br /><br />\nAutomobiles<br /><br />\nTHE BACKUS MOTOR COMPANY<br />\n10-20 E.

B.'s and the<br />\nengineers.<br />\nThese facts may, as I suggested at the outset, be of no consequence, but they do open up a field of speculation that might<br />\nprove beneficial. It is not a new question, but it is one that changing customs and shifting viewpoints keep fresh. The question is<br />\nthe very fundamental one of the purpose of college education.<br /><br />\nHUGO WEISBERGER<br /><br />\n913 N. CHARLES STREET, BALTIMORE, MD.<br /><br />\nThe chance arrangement that annoys me is the division of a<br />\nnominally unified undergraduate body into three schools\u2014Arts<br />\nand Sciences, Engineering, and Business Economics, not to add<br />\nthe unclassified few who graduate with the degree of Bachelor of<br />\nScience in Chemistry. The necessity of segregating the students<br />\naccording to their fields of study, insofar as these fields are general<br />\nand quite distinct, is clear enough. The present plan, it seems to<br />\nme, doesn't quite preserve the proper coordination between these<br />\nparts. In the first place, the School of Business Economics is so<br />\nsmall that it has no locale and almost no personnel of its own, but<br />\nseems rather to be a minor appendage of the Economics department of the graduate school. Its most important staff members<br />\nare grouped around the economics library just as are the academic<br />\nteachers about the respective libraries, a circumstance which<br />\nwould seem to class the Economics School as a branch of the<br />\nArts College coordinate with history and biology, rather than a<br />\nseparate and independent school coodinate with the Arts College itself.<br />\nSecond, the dean of Arts and Sciences ought to have no more<br />\ndignity and prominence than the dean of Engineering or\u2014if<br />\nthere was one\u2014of Business Economics. But as a matter of fact<br />\nthe word \"dean\" as it is commonly used is taken to refer to the<br />\ndean of Arts and Sciences unless further specified. NEWS-LETTER<br />\nreporters, seeking weighty opinions on matters of interest to students, inentably neglect the second floor of M. E. for the basement of Remsen. When \"the dean\" addresses the freshmen each<br />\nfall, there is never any doubt as to which dean is meant. And<br />\nto round it all off, in the College of Arts and Sciences the graduate<br />\nand undergraduate work is geographically so commingled that the<br />\nunfortunate, if undeserving undergraduate are left without a<br />\nplace to call their own.<br /><br />\nBUSINESS DEPARTMENT<br /><br />\nAdvertising Manager<br />\nSADLER ROBERTSON, '3.1<br /><br />\nABOUT EDUCATION<br /><br />\nTHE UNITED RAILWAYS AND ELECTRIC CO.<br />\nof Baltimore<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n1855 \u2022 SEVENTY-FIFTH<br /><br />\nANNIVERSARY \u2022 1930<br /><br />\nWatering 87,000<br />\nHorses<br />\nOn Horseshoe Lake near Oklahoma City, in<br />\na businesslike,compact building,87,000 horses<br />\n(figuratively speaking) are stabled ... nearly<br />\nthree for every family in Oklahoma City.
