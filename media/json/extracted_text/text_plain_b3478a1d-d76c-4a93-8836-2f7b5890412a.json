Indeed, I think that academic<br />\nmen once and again catch themselves entertaining the same feeling for a brief interval, if<br />\nthey stir much abroad in the world. An uneasy consciousness creeps in upon them that<br />\ntheir ordinary way of looking at things in the<br />\nlecture hall and in class-room discussions is a<br />\nvery much specialized way and seems always<br />\na little narrow and impractical when used in<br />\nthe midst of affairs. It may be, in its place, a<br />\nnecessary and useful way of looking at things,<br />\nand better suited than most to clarified reasoning ; but it involves standing at a peculiar<br />\npoint of view, hardly practicable for men outside the University; and, though we may<br />\nChoose to retain it, it is best that we should<br />\nunderstand just what it is and know how, by<br />\nkeeping it, we differ from the man of affairs.<br />\nIf a man of affairs were asked what it was<br />\nthat made him feel out of sympathy with university teachers and with the pupils who had<br />\nbeen most recently under their influence, he<br />\nwould probably say that practical men look at<br />\nthings as they are, but that university men prefer to look at things as they ought to be; and<br />\nthat, since things are not as they ought to be,<br />\nuniversity men usually fail to get practicable<br />\nopinions, for all their thinking. Some of this<br />\nthe university man must admit. He studies<br />\nfacts to get at principles, and when he has arrived at his principles he perceives that some<br />\nof the facts he has recorded and examined are<br />\nessential, while the rest are subsidiary and in<br />\na sense accidental \u2014 aside from the point.<br />\nThese latter he forthwith puts on one side and<br />\nproceeds to neglect, and builds his reasoning<br />\non the significant<br />\nand essential matters which<br />\nhe has sifted out.<br />\nHe has reached his \"aca-<br />\n<br />\nNo. 5<br />\n<br />\ndemic point of view,\" and has set his reasoning free from encumbrance. He has discovered how things would be if principles operated<br />\nsingly, simply, without mixture or confusion<br />\nof irrelevant things. However concrete his<br />\n.facts, they are selected facts, and he is reasoning in the abstract, looking at the gross world<br />\nin analysis, and not in combination.<br />\nThat is why the practical man regards him<br />\nwith uneasiness and charges him with dealing<br />\nin unrealities. The practical man knows that<br />\nin affairs things cannot be treated as simples :<br />\nfacts cannot be selected. Logically irrelevant<br />\ncircumstances may in actual life have as much<br />\nimportance as circumstances which are of the<br />\nessence of the business in hand, and, however<br />\nmuch you may wish to sift the pertinent from<br />\nthe impertinent, you cannot do it. They are,<br />\nin fact, inseparable, and you must deal with<br />\nthem in the bulk, not according to their quality, but according to their gross weight and<br />\nquantity. You are apt to be rendered incapable of dealing with actual life, the practical man<br />\nbelieves, by dealing so much with your own<br />\nabstract and partial analysis of it. You may<br />\nhave a perfectly developed logical faculty, and<br />\nyet no practical sagacity whatever : your practice in abstract reasoning may even tend to destroy your native sense of what is wise and<br />\npracticable, for it may render you impatient<br />\nwith makeshift and management, your only<br />\nmeans of success. The new-fledged college<br />\ngraduate always wants to \"turn the world upside down,\" older men complain, and that very<br />\ndesire proves his unwise training.<br />\nThere is something in these objections that<br />\ncollege men ought to heed. We should not<br />\ngive up abstract reasoning or stop subjecting<br />\nfacts to a careful differentiation and sifting.<br />\nWe must continue to separate facts and to<br />\nclassify them, to purge away their accidental<br />\nelements, and to come at their secrets of abstract principle and intrinsic law. We could<br />\nhave no science, otherwise, and no adequate<br />\nknowledge of the world in its elements; and<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nunless'we knew it in its elements we could not<br />\nknow it in its action as a whole, complex and<br />\nfruitful of power. But we should have the<br />\nother side of knowledge, too \u2014 that feeling for<br />\naffairs which is synthetic and which shall enable us to deal with rough life as we find it.<br />\nWe must not fall out of sympathy with life because it is not like what we make of it in our<br />\nlaboratories and in our seminaries. We must<br />\nbe proper men of the world, as well as trained<br />\nacademic reasoners must know when and<br />\nwhere \"the academic point of view\" is to be<br />\ntaken and when and where it is entirely out of<br />\nplace, and pedantic.<br />\nNo doubt the best way to reach this balance<br />\nand readiness at adjustment is to give our<br />\nminds a various diet and a liberal view of the<br />\nworld, by reading books that are full of the<br />\ncommon life of the world, as well as books<br />\nupon our own special topics of academic<br />\nstudy \u2014 the better sort of novels, with real<br />\npeople in them, such as masters like Fielding<br />\nand Sienkiewicz can create; such poetry as<br />\nruns hot with the motives that send men to action and to self-sacrifice; such histories as contain the real rush and variety of life; and travels that meant something more for the traveler<br />\nthan mere sight-seeing or mere pleasure. University men seldom have time during their<br />\nterm of study for real contact with affairs; but<br />\nthey can put their minds every day for a little<br />\nwhile into the air of the world that moves outside laboratories and lecture halls, in streets<br />\nand markets, on prairie and ocean, on frontiers<br />\nand battle-fields, in households and in the lobbies of parliaments \u2014 and so not forget that<br />\nother side of things which the practical man<br />\nfears he may forget. He should not for a moment despise his \"academic point of view\"<br />\n(for the advancement of exact knowledge and,<br />\nin the end, the progress of the world depend<br />\nupon its assiduous cultivation) ; but he should<br />\nbe ready to abandon it, and should instinctively<br />\nabandon it, the moment it becomes unsuitable<br />\nfor the practical business of life. He must not<br />\nbe a pedant : he must be a trained thinker who<br />\nis also a man of the world.<br />\nWOODROW WILSON.<br />\n<br />\nDR. VINCENT ON \"GENEVA.\"<br />\nProfessor Vincent delivered a very entertaining address upon \"Geneva\" before the<br />\nHistorical and Political Science Association<br />\non Friday evening. His talk was based upon<br />\npersonal reminiscences of his visit to the city<br />\nlast summer. The worthy professor was considerably shocked at the rather loose observance of the Sabbath. Every Sunday morning<br />\nhe was awakened by target practice under his<br />\nwindow ; and, after enjoying a very pious sermon, was accustomed to see the worthy<br />\npreacher regaling himself with a game of ten<br />\npins and other kindred amusements. Elections are always held on that day; and in consideration of municipal politics, it is worthy to<br />\nnote that the Genevese do not apparently care<br />\nfor the luxury of a mayor, and consequently<br />\nentrust the duties of that office to a council.<br />\nThe Church and State are very closely connected, ministers being elected by popular vote<br />\nof the people, and have their salaries paid by<br />\nthe Government. The laboring classes are<br />\npoor, but not subdued; and nowhere in Europe, says Professor Vincent, did he find that<br />\ncharacteristically American broadness of<br />\nviews and democratic instincts so prevalent as<br />\nin Geneva. The beauties of the place are seldom exaggerated. The effect of the gorgeous<br />\ngrandeur of its surrounding rivers and mountains make a picture almost too glorious for<br />\ndescription.<br />\nIn accordance with Professor Adams' custom of making the library and lecture-rooms<br />\nas attractive as possible, quite a number of new<br />\npictures and paintings have been added to the<br />\nlarge number which now hang upon the walls.<br />\n\"Boswell,\" said Dr. Johnson, meeting the<br />\nbiographer on the street, \"I have been reading some of your manuscripts.

Only persons enrolled in the register of the University<br />\nand their wives are eligible to membership.<br />\nThe annual dues will be $1. The association<br />\nwill give four evening musicales, under the direction of Mr. W.Edward Heimendahl, in McCoy Hall, during the months of December,<br />\nJanuary, February and March. The number<br />\nof persons present at the musicales is limited<br />\nto 250. Membership tickets may be obtained at the office of the Registrar of the University. The arrangements are made by the<br />\nfollowing persons:<br />\nPresident and Mrs. Gilman,<br />\nProf. P. Haupt,<br />\nMrs. E. H. Griffin,<br />\nMrs. M.Bloomfield, Dr.T.S.

Speaker<br />\nFrench, of the House, called the meeting to<br />\norder, and after welcoming the Senate to the<br />\njoint session, gave up the chair to President<br />\nDieffenbach, of the Senate. The Censor announced that the President desired to address<br />\nthe meeting, and Messrs. Straus and Grimes<br />\nwere appointed to escort him to the room.<br />\nIn his speech Dr. Gilman dwelt upon the<br />\nvalue of presence to a speaker, and advised the<br />\nmembers of the Congress, when speaking, to<br />\ntalk to the most remote of his audience, and<br />\nto catch their attention individually. He also<br />\nbrought forward the obligation which lies<br />\nupon every young man to take active interest<br />\nin public affairs, and pointed out the many<br />\nchances open to them to enter the public service. Dr. Gilman was suffering from a severe<br />\ncold and made his address only by great effort. He was listened to with great interest,<br />\nand heartily applauded. Messrs. Fitzgerald<br />\nand Knapp were appointed to escort him to<br />\nhis office. The meeting then adjourned.<br />\nTHE CUBAN QUESTION.<br />\nEach meeting of the Senate is an improvement on the previous one. Last Wednesday<br />\nthe presence of President Gilman and Dean<br />\nGriffin lent a dignity to the session, which did<br />\nnot result in stage fright among the speakers,<br />\nbut, on the contrary, seemed to inspire them to<br />\ndebate more forcibly and fluently. Indeed, so<br />\nwell was the subject handled that Senator Ballard, when called upon in the open debate,<br />\nfound he could add nothing to what had already been said, which was somewhat surprising. The subject was: \"Should the United<br />\nStates intervene in behalf of Cuba?\" Senators<br />\nClarke, Seth and Fender made good arguments for Cuba, and Senators Stearns and<br />\nHammond defended the negative side of the<br />\nquestion. Senator Ulman was absent.

In previous years this<br />\nquestion has invariably been asked and has as<br />\noften received the answer : \"Fine,\" only to<br />\nbe made ridiculous later on by a long string of<br />\ndefeats. Therefore, with these experiences in<br />\nmind, we prefer to waive a direct answer to<br />\nyour question, and trust that time and the<br />\ncourse of events will give you ample compensation for your waiting.<br />\nAlthough we are not predicting success, we<br />\nare, nevertheless, not without strong hopes<br />\nthat, by hard work and consistent training, we<br />\nmay bring the 1898 championship to adorn the<br />\nwalls of our new gymnasium. This brings up<br />\nthe question : Will the baseball team really<br />\ntrain ? If so, what method will be pursued?<br />\nWe answer : Yes, they must train.<br />\nWhy<br />\nshouldn't they ? Other college teams feel the<br />\nnecessity of training, and Hopkins men,<br />\nsurely, can't afford to neglect it. This statement hardly needs further explanation, for all<br />\nof us know that a team, no matter how good<br />\nits players may be individually, cannot hope to<br />\ncompete successfully with its opponents, unless it has acquired that perfection of team<br />\nplay which comes only by hard and constant<br />\npractice.<br />\nLet no man imagine that the team has already been \"picked,\" for positively no \"sifting\" of material will take place before we<br />\nshall have had outdoor practice. Let every<br />\nstudent who plays ball hand in his name to<br />\nManager Haulenbeek, for even if he shouldn't<br />\n\"make the 'Varsity,\" he may \"make the<br />\nscrub\" which will be organized to give the<br />\nfirst team at least one practice game a week.<br />\nSeveral promising candidates have already<br />\nappeared, among whom are: Haulenbeek,<br />\nWight, Joyner, Hitzrot, Rogers, Foster,<br />\n<br />\nFletcher, Wirt, Rickey, Grimes, Talty, Everett, Swaine, Warren and others. Now that<br />\nwe are to have our cage, and consequently<br />\ncan arrange an hour and place suitable to the<br />\nMedical men for practice, we expect to get out<br />\nsome of the fine material always to be found<br />\nat the Medical School.<br />\nBut the success of any team depends on the<br />\nencouragement and support given it by the<br />\nstudents, and, realizing this, we ask only for<br />\nan honest trial before condemnation.<br />\nATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.<br />\n<br />\nThe Athletic Association held its first meeting yesterday afternoon in Hopkins Hall. Officers were elected as follows:<br />\nPresident\u2014Professor Edward A. Renouf.<br />\nVice-President\u2014Wm. H. Maddren (Medical School).<br />\nSecretary\u2014Frank J. Clunet ('98).<br />\nTreasurer\u2014Dr. J. Bascom Crenshaw.<br />\nThe other delegates are : Robert Garrett,<br />\nG. Canby Robinson and George W.Knapp,Jr.<br />\nA 'Varsity handball team,consisting of Wm.<br />\nH. Maddren and Ward Simmons, was recognized by the Athletic Association. During the<br />\nholidays these men will represent Hopkins in<br />\na contest with the Polytechnic team of Brooklyn. It is Hopkins' first move in this sport,<br />\nand the start is a very auspicious one.<br />\nThe proposed formation of a new lacrosse<br />\nassociation by Harvard, Yale, Pennsylvania<br />\nand Cornell, in the face of a strongly organized<br />\nassociation in existence at present, was also<br />\nsettled. The Hopkins will prevent this by<br />\njoining the Inter-collegiate Athletic Association, thereby completing, with Lehigh and<br />\nStevens, a deal for full and official recognition<br />\nas the only lacrosse association.<br />\nIt was decided that a house committee<br />\nwould have charge of the new gymnasium<br />\nwhen completed. One graduate, two seniors,<br />\none junior and one freshman will compose the<br />\ncommittee, with the consent of the faculty.<br />\nHOCKEY.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hockey League is at present in a state<br />\nof uncertainty. At the last meeting of the<br />\nBoard of Delegates a dispute arose in regard<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nto the admission of the Maryland Hockey<br />\nTeam into the League, and the percentage of<br />\ngate receipts to be allowed the team. All the<br />\nteams represented voted against admitting the<br />\nMarylands, and against lowering the percentage from ten to five per cent. Manager Towers, of the rink, took the other side, however,<br />\nand the meeting ended in a disagreement.<br />\nUntil there is a mutual agreement between the<br />\nrink management and the various teams and<br />\nplayers, there will hardly be any city championship games. The rink is making arrangements for outside teams to play the Maryland<br />\nHockey Team,but, as these teams are brought<br />\non at a great expense in most instances, there<br />\nwill be very little profit by such action. Unless there are well-contested local games, it is<br />\nalmost safe to say that there will be very little<br />\ninterest taken in visiting teams.<br />\nIt is hoped that an early solution to the<br />\nproblem will be brought forward and amicable relations cemented among the contending<br />\nparties.<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\n<br />\nA dispatch from Cambridge, stating that the<br />\nmanager of the Harvard lacrosse team has<br />\nopened negotiations with the lacrosse authorities at Yale, Columbia, Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania, informs us of the revival of lacrosse among the Northern colleges.<br />\nTwo years ago Harvard played Hopkins to<br />\na tie. There was a time when Cornell and<br />\nPrinceton had first-class tennis, but during the<br />\npast few years little or no interest has been<br />\ntaken in lacrosse at these institutions.<br />\nIt would be of great advantage to all if these<br />\ncolleges, which contemplate reviving lacrosse, would apply for membership to the<br />\nInter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association, which<br />\nis composed of Hopkins, Lehigh and Stevens.<br />\nAmple provision is to be made in the new<br />\ncage for the track team. Next the walls a cinder track is to be laid out, and banked at all the<br />\ncurves. It will be an eighteen-lap track. Here<br />\nthe team can train at all times and in all weath-<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\ners. Dr. Shattuck, assistant in geology, has<br />\noffered to coach the men, and Mr. MacDermott will probably be with us as well.<br />\nThe records recently made by Robert Garrett under J. H. U. colors in outdoor broad<br />\njump and throwing the discus and indoor 16pound-shot-put have been adopted by the<br />\nMaryland Board of Records.<br />\nA WORD OF WIT.<br />\nWHO KNOWS?<br />\n<br />\n\"No, gentlemen,\" said the professor,\"I insist that nosology is not the study of noses.\"<br />\nHAD COMPANY.<br />\n<br />\nVisitor: Who is the gentleman sitting near<br />\nthe professor ?<br />\nMr. Bretzelesser (student): Ach I dot is his\u2014<br />\nhis\u2014accomplice.<br />\nWhen lips are cherry-red,<br />\nWhen eyes are blue\u2014<br />\n\"Visions of loveliness,\"<br />\nI think, don't you?<br />\nWhen eyes are cherry-red,<br />\nAnd lips are blue\u2014<br />\n\"Someone's been on a bat,\"<br />\nI think, don't you?<br />\n\u2014Columbia Morningside.<br />\n1.

He spoke very rapidly, yet distinctly and<br />\nprecisely, and was heartily applauded. Senators Stearns and Hammond also did well. In<br />\nthe open debate Senators R. D. Miller and<br />\nYoung took part.<br />\nPresident Gilman, in a two-minute talk recommended that the members attend a session<br />\nof the National Congress in Washington to<br />\ngain points in parliamentary practice and debating. He also congratulated the Senators<br />\nupon their work, and promised to have a clock<br />\non the wall of the Senate Chamber in time for<br />\nthe next meeting.<br />\nSenator Bestor read several reports from<br />\nother colleges where forensic oratory has been<br />\ntried. Their tone, on the whole, was not encouraging. The Congress at Johns Hopkins<br />\nis now a successful reality. It has been suggested that the reason of this is that the conduct of the Congress is happily in charge of<br />\nfaculty and students. In this respect it differs<br />\nfrom the ordinary course, and gives the advantages of a debating society, combined with the<br />\nvalued advice of an experienced instructor.<br />\nThe subject for debate for the next session<br />\nis : \"Resolved, That capital punishment be<br />\nabolished.\" Senators Dohme, C. Hodges and<br />\nHubner, affirmative, and Senators Robinson,<br />\nF. W. Smith and Gordon, negative.<br />\nThe fourth regular meeting of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives was held Wednesday, November 24. The debate, \"Resolved, That the<br />\nUnited States should intervene in the case of<br />\nCuba,\" was very spirited, and showed careful<br />\npreparation on the part of the debaters. That<br />\nthe debaters spoke with hardly any reference<br />\nto their notes was very gratifying, and added<br />\nmuch to the interest of the debate. The negative side, which consisted of Congressmen<br />\nGuggenheimer, Ross and Fischer, won the debate. The Censor, in his criticism, complimented the negative side on their earnest work<br />\nin preparation for the dabate. Congressman<br />\nFischer, he said, was very witty and effective<br />\nin his arguments. The affirmative side was<br />\nsomewhat handicapped by the absence of one<br />\nof their regular debaters. Congressman Lev-<br />\n<br />\nering was asked to fill the vacancy. The subject for debate at the next regular meeting of<br />\nthe House will be : \"Resolved, That capital<br />\npunishment should be abolished.\" The debaters will be : Affirmative \u2014 Congressmen<br />\nRemsen, Keidel and Welber. Negative\u2014Congressmen Murkland, Davidson and Krager.<br />\nThe House was favored with the presence of<br />\nDr. Greene and Dr. Vincent.<br />\n11EDICAL SCHOOL NEWS.<br />\n<br />\nDr. L. F. Barke held his first quiz in histology on Friday, December 3, which will be followed by one on each succeeding Friday<br />\nthroughout the course. These quizzes are so<br />\noriginal and interesting that the students look<br />\nforward to them with more pleasure than fear.<br />\nThe quizzes in anatomy will be conducted this<br />\nyear by Drs. Mall, Lord and Harrison.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that the smoker which the<br />\nfirst-year class had prepared to have some<br />\nweeks ago, has not been permanently postponed. By this informal means the studeatt<br />\nwould meet and know each other, which, otherwise, may not be accomplished for some<br />\ntime, owing to the unusual size of the class.<br />\nArrangements for smokers should be made<br />\nas soon as possible, for before long everyone<br />\nwill be so busy that the interest for its success<br />\nwill be subordinate.<br />\nCLASS rIEETINOS.<br />\n<br />\nThe class of '98 met on Wednesday and<br />\nelected Messrs.

Indeed, I think that academic<br />\nmen once and again catch themselves entertaining the same feeling for a brief interval, if<br />\nthey stir much abroad in the world. An uneasy consciousness creeps in upon them that<br />\ntheir ordinary way of looking at things in the<br />\nlecture hall and in class-room discussions is a<br />\nvery much specialized way and seems always<br />\na little narrow and impractical when used in<br />\nthe midst of affairs. It may be, in its place, a<br />\nnecessary and useful way of looking at things,<br />\nand better suited than most to clarified reasoning ; but it involves standing at a peculiar<br />\npoint of view, hardly practicable for men outside the University; and, though we may<br />\nChoose to retain it, it is best that we should<br />\nunderstand just what it is and know how, by<br />\nkeeping it, we differ from the man of affairs.<br />\nIf a man of affairs were asked what it was<br />\nthat made him feel out of sympathy with university teachers and with the pupils who had<br />\nbeen most recently under their influence, he<br />\nwould probably say that practical men look at<br />\nthings as they are, but that university men prefer to look at things as they ought to be; and<br />\nthat, since things are not as they ought to be,<br />\nuniversity men usually fail to get practicable<br />\nopinions, for all their thinking. Some of this<br />\nthe university man must admit. He studies<br />\nfacts to get at principles, and when he has arrived at his principles he perceives that some<br />\nof the facts he has recorded and examined are<br />\nessential, while the rest are subsidiary and in<br />\na sense accidental \u2014 aside from the point.<br />\nThese latter he forthwith puts on one side and<br />\nproceeds to neglect, and builds his reasoning<br />\non the significant<br />\nand essential matters which<br />\nhe has sifted out.<br />\nHe has reached his \"aca-<br /><br />\nNo. 5<br /><br />\ndemic point of view,\" and has set his reasoning free from encumbrance. He has discovered how things would be if principles operated<br />\nsingly, simply, without mixture or confusion<br />\nof irrelevant things. However concrete his<br />\n.facts, they are selected facts, and he is reasoning in the abstract, looking at the gross world<br />\nin analysis, and not in combination.<br />\nThat is why the practical man regards him<br />\nwith uneasiness and charges him with dealing<br />\nin unrealities. The practical man knows that<br />\nin affairs things cannot be treated as simples :<br />\nfacts cannot be selected. Logically irrelevant<br />\ncircumstances may in actual life have as much<br />\nimportance as circumstances which are of the<br />\nessence of the business in hand, and, however<br />\nmuch you may wish to sift the pertinent from<br />\nthe impertinent, you cannot do it. They are,<br />\nin fact, inseparable, and you must deal with<br />\nthem in the bulk, not according to their quality, but according to their gross weight and<br />\nquantity. You are apt to be rendered incapable of dealing with actual life, the practical man<br />\nbelieves, by dealing so much with your own<br />\nabstract and partial analysis of it. You may<br />\nhave a perfectly developed logical faculty, and<br />\nyet no practical sagacity whatever : your practice in abstract reasoning may even tend to destroy your native sense of what is wise and<br />\npracticable, for it may render you impatient<br />\nwith makeshift and management, your only<br />\nmeans of success. The new-fledged college<br />\ngraduate always wants to \"turn the world upside down,\" older men complain, and that very<br />\ndesire proves his unwise training.<br />\nThere is something in these objections that<br />\ncollege men ought to heed. We should not<br />\ngive up abstract reasoning or stop subjecting<br />\nfacts to a careful differentiation and sifting.<br />\nWe must continue to separate facts and to<br />\nclassify them, to purge away their accidental<br />\nelements, and to come at their secrets of abstract principle and intrinsic law. We could<br />\nhave no science, otherwise, and no adequate<br />\nknowledge of the world in its elements; and<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nunless'we knew it in its elements we could not<br />\nknow it in its action as a whole, complex and<br />\nfruitful of power. But we should have the<br />\nother side of knowledge, too \u2014 that feeling for<br />\naffairs which is synthetic and which shall enable us to deal with rough life as we find it.<br />\nWe must not fall out of sympathy with life because it is not like what we make of it in our<br />\nlaboratories and in our seminaries. We must<br />\nbe proper men of the world, as well as trained<br />\nacademic reasoners must know when and<br />\nwhere \"the academic point of view\" is to be<br />\ntaken and when and where it is entirely out of<br />\nplace, and pedantic.<br />\nNo doubt the best way to reach this balance<br />\nand readiness at adjustment is to give our<br />\nminds a various diet and a liberal view of the<br />\nworld, by reading books that are full of the<br />\ncommon life of the world, as well as books<br />\nupon our own special topics of academic<br />\nstudy \u2014 the better sort of novels, with real<br />\npeople in them, such as masters like Fielding<br />\nand Sienkiewicz can create; such poetry as<br />\nruns hot with the motives that send men to action and to self-sacrifice; such histories as contain the real rush and variety of life; and travels that meant something more for the traveler<br />\nthan mere sight-seeing or mere pleasure. University men seldom have time during their<br />\nterm of study for real contact with affairs; but<br />\nthey can put their minds every day for a little<br />\nwhile into the air of the world that moves outside laboratories and lecture halls, in streets<br />\nand markets, on prairie and ocean, on frontiers<br />\nand battle-fields, in households and in the lobbies of parliaments \u2014 and so not forget that<br />\nother side of things which the practical man<br />\nfears he may forget. He should not for a moment despise his \"academic point of view\"<br />\n(for the advancement of exact knowledge and,<br />\nin the end, the progress of the world depend<br />\nupon its assiduous cultivation) ; but he should<br />\nbe ready to abandon it, and should instinctively<br />\nabandon it, the moment it becomes unsuitable<br />\nfor the practical business of life. He must not<br />\nbe a pedant : he must be a trained thinker who<br />\nis also a man of the world.<br />\nWOODROW WILSON.<br /><br />\nDR. VINCENT ON \"GENEVA.\"<br />\nProfessor Vincent delivered a very entertaining address upon \"Geneva\" before the<br />\nHistorical and Political Science Association<br />\non Friday evening. His talk was based upon<br />\npersonal reminiscences of his visit to the city<br />\nlast summer. The worthy professor was considerably shocked at the rather loose observance of the Sabbath. Every Sunday morning<br />\nhe was awakened by target practice under his<br />\nwindow ; and, after enjoying a very pious sermon, was accustomed to see the worthy<br />\npreacher regaling himself with a game of ten<br />\npins and other kindred amusements. Elections are always held on that day; and in consideration of municipal politics, it is worthy to<br />\nnote that the Genevese do not apparently care<br />\nfor the luxury of a mayor, and consequently<br />\nentrust the duties of that office to a council.<br />\nThe Church and State are very closely connected, ministers being elected by popular vote<br />\nof the people, and have their salaries paid by<br />\nthe Government. The laboring classes are<br />\npoor, but not subdued; and nowhere in Europe, says Professor Vincent, did he find that<br />\ncharacteristically American broadness of<br />\nviews and democratic instincts so prevalent as<br />\nin Geneva. The beauties of the place are seldom exaggerated. The effect of the gorgeous<br />\ngrandeur of its surrounding rivers and mountains make a picture almost too glorious for<br />\ndescription.<br />\nIn accordance with Professor Adams' custom of making the library and lecture-rooms<br />\nas attractive as possible, quite a number of new<br />\npictures and paintings have been added to the<br />\nlarge number which now hang upon the walls.<br />\n\"Boswell,\" said Dr. Johnson, meeting the<br />\nbiographer on the street, \"I have been reading some of your manuscripts.

The association<br />\nwill give four evening musicales, under the direction of Mr. W.Edward Heimendahl, in McCoy Hall, during the months of December,<br />\nJanuary, February and March. The number<br />\nof persons present at the musicales is limited<br />\nto 250. Membership tickets may be obtained at the office of the Registrar of the University.

Speaker<br />\nFrench, of the House, called the meeting to<br />\norder, and after welcoming the Senate to the<br />\njoint session, gave up the chair to President<br />\nDieffenbach, of the Senate. The Censor announced that the President desired to address<br />\nthe meeting, and Messrs. Straus and Grimes<br />\nwere appointed to escort him to the room.<br />\nIn his speech Dr. Gilman dwelt upon the<br />\nvalue of presence to a speaker, and advised the<br />\nmembers of the Congress, when speaking, to<br />\ntalk to the most remote of his audience, and<br />\nto catch their attention individually. He also<br />\nbrought forward the obligation which lies<br />\nupon every young man to take active interest<br />\nin public affairs, and pointed out the many<br />\nchances open to them to enter the public service. Dr. Gilman was suffering from a severe<br />\ncold and made his address only by great effort. He was listened to with great interest,<br />\nand heartily applauded. Messrs. Fitzgerald<br />\nand Knapp were appointed to escort him to<br />\nhis office. The meeting then adjourned.<br />\nTHE CUBAN QUESTION.<br />\nEach meeting of the Senate is an improvement on the previous one. Last Wednesday<br />\nthe presence of President Gilman and Dean<br />\nGriffin lent a dignity to the session, which did<br />\nnot result in stage fright among the speakers,<br />\nbut, on the contrary, seemed to inspire them to<br />\ndebate more forcibly and fluently. Indeed, so<br />\nwell was the subject handled that Senator Ballard, when called upon in the open debate,<br />\nfound he could add nothing to what had already been said, which was somewhat surprising. The subject was: \"Should the United<br />\nStates intervene in behalf of Cuba?\" Senators<br />\nClarke, Seth and Fender made good arguments for Cuba, and Senators Stearns and<br />\nHammond defended the negative side of the<br />\nquestion. Senator Ulman was absent.

This statement hardly needs further explanation, for all<br />\nof us know that a team, no matter how good<br />\nits players may be individually, cannot hope to<br />\ncompete successfully with its opponents, unless it has acquired that perfection of team<br />\nplay which comes only by hard and constant<br />\npractice.<br />\nLet no man imagine that the team has already been \"picked,\" for positively no \"sifting\" of material will take place before we<br />\nshall have had outdoor practice. Let every<br />\nstudent who plays ball hand in his name to<br />\nManager Haulenbeek, for even if he shouldn't<br />\n\"make the 'Varsity,\" he may \"make the<br />\nscrub\" which will be organized to give the<br />\nfirst team at least one practice game a week.<br />\nSeveral promising candidates have already<br />\nappeared, among whom are: Haulenbeek,<br />\nWight, Joyner, Hitzrot, Rogers, Foster,<br /><br />\nFletcher, Wirt, Rickey, Grimes, Talty, Everett, Swaine, Warren and others. Now that<br />\nwe are to have our cage, and consequently<br />\ncan arrange an hour and place suitable to the<br />\nMedical men for practice, we expect to get out<br />\nsome of the fine material always to be found<br />\nat the Medical School.<br />\nBut the success of any team depends on the<br />\nencouragement and support given it by the<br />\nstudents, and, realizing this, we ask only for<br />\nan honest trial before condemnation.<br />\nATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.<br /><br />\nThe Athletic Association held its first meeting yesterday afternoon in Hopkins Hall. Officers were elected as follows:<br />\nPresident\u2014Professor Edward A. Renouf.<br />\nVice-President\u2014Wm. H. Maddren (Medical School).<br />\nSecretary\u2014Frank J. Clunet ('98).<br />\nTreasurer\u2014Dr. J. Bascom Crenshaw.<br />\nThe other delegates are : Robert Garrett,<br />\nG. Canby Robinson and George W.Knapp,Jr.<br />\nA 'Varsity handball team,consisting of Wm.<br />\nH. Maddren and Ward Simmons, was recognized by the Athletic Association. During the<br />\nholidays these men will represent Hopkins in<br />\na contest with the Polytechnic team of Brooklyn. It is Hopkins' first move in this sport,<br />\nand the start is a very auspicious one.<br />\nThe proposed formation of a new lacrosse<br />\nassociation by Harvard, Yale, Pennsylvania<br />\nand Cornell, in the face of a strongly organized<br />\nassociation in existence at present, was also<br />\nsettled. The Hopkins will prevent this by<br />\njoining the Inter-collegiate Athletic Association, thereby completing, with Lehigh and<br />\nStevens, a deal for full and official recognition<br />\nas the only lacrosse association.<br />\nIt was decided that a house committee<br />\nwould have charge of the new gymnasium<br />\nwhen completed. One graduate, two seniors,<br />\none junior and one freshman will compose the<br />\ncommittee, with the consent of the faculty.<br />\nHOCKEY.<br /><br />\nThe Hockey League is at present in a state<br />\nof uncertainty. At the last meeting of the<br />\nBoard of Delegates a dispute arose in regard<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nto the admission of the Maryland Hockey<br />\nTeam into the League, and the percentage of<br />\ngate receipts to be allowed the team. All the<br />\nteams represented voted against admitting the<br />\nMarylands, and against lowering the percentage from ten to five per cent. Manager Towers, of the rink, took the other side, however,<br />\nand the meeting ended in a disagreement.<br />\nUntil there is a mutual agreement between the<br />\nrink management and the various teams and<br />\nplayers, there will hardly be any city championship games. The rink is making arrangements for outside teams to play the Maryland<br />\nHockey Team,but, as these teams are brought<br />\non at a great expense in most instances, there<br />\nwill be very little profit by such action. Unless there are well-contested local games, it is<br />\nalmost safe to say that there will be very little<br />\ninterest taken in visiting teams.<br />\nIt is hoped that an early solution to the<br />\nproblem will be brought forward and amicable relations cemented among the contending<br />\nparties.<br />\nLACROSSE.<br /><br />\nA dispatch from Cambridge, stating that the<br />\nmanager of the Harvard lacrosse team has<br />\nopened negotiations with the lacrosse authorities at Yale, Columbia, Cornell and the University of Pennsylvania, informs us of the revival of lacrosse among the Northern colleges.<br />\nTwo years ago Harvard played Hopkins to<br />\na tie. There was a time when Cornell and<br />\nPrinceton had first-class tennis, but during the<br />\npast few years little or no interest has been<br />\ntaken in lacrosse at these institutions.<br />\nIt would be of great advantage to all if these<br />\ncolleges, which contemplate reviving lacrosse, would apply for membership to the<br />\nInter-Collegiate Lacrosse Association, which<br />\nis composed of Hopkins, Lehigh and Stevens.<br />\nAmple provision is to be made in the new<br />\ncage for the track team. Next the walls a cinder track is to be laid out, and banked at all the<br />\ncurves. It will be an eighteen-lap track. Here<br />\nthe team can train at all times and in all weath-<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\ners. Dr. Shattuck, assistant in geology, has<br />\noffered to coach the men, and Mr. MacDermott will probably be with us as well.<br />\nThe records recently made by Robert Garrett under J. H. U. colors in outdoor broad<br />\njump and throwing the discus and indoor 16pound-shot-put have been adopted by the<br />\nMaryland Board of Records.<br />\nA WORD OF WIT.<br />\nWHO KNOWS?<br /><br />\n\"No, gentlemen,\" said the professor,\"I insist that nosology is not the study of noses.\"<br />\nHAD COMPANY.<br /><br />\nVisitor: Who is the gentleman sitting near<br />\nthe professor ?<br />\nMr. Bretzelesser (student): Ach I dot is his\u2014<br />\nhis\u2014accomplice.<br />\nWhen lips are cherry-red,<br />\nWhen eyes are blue\u2014<br />\n\"Visions of loveliness,\"<br />\nI think, don't you?<br />\nWhen eyes are cherry-red,<br />\nAnd lips are blue\u2014<br />\n\"Someone's been on a bat,\"<br />\nI think, don't you?<br />\n\u2014Columbia Morningside.<br />\n1.

He spoke very rapidly, yet distinctly and<br />\nprecisely, and was heartily applauded. Senators Stearns and Hammond also did well. In<br />\nthe open debate Senators R. D. Miller and<br />\nYoung took part.<br />\nPresident Gilman, in a two-minute talk recommended that the members attend a session<br />\nof the National Congress in Washington to<br />\ngain points in parliamentary practice and debating. He also congratulated the Senators<br />\nupon their work, and promised to have a clock<br />\non the wall of the Senate Chamber in time for<br />\nthe next meeting.<br />\nSenator Bestor read several reports from<br />\nother colleges where forensic oratory has been<br />\ntried. Their tone, on the whole, was not encouraging. The Congress at Johns Hopkins<br />\nis now a successful reality. It has been suggested that the reason of this is that the conduct of the Congress is happily in charge of<br />\nfaculty and students. In this respect it differs<br />\nfrom the ordinary course, and gives the advantages of a debating society, combined with the<br />\nvalued advice of an experienced instructor.<br />\nThe subject for debate for the next session<br />\nis : \"Resolved, That capital punishment be<br />\nabolished.\" Senators Dohme, C. Hodges and<br />\nHubner, affirmative, and Senators Robinson,<br />\nF. W. Smith and Gordon, negative.<br />\nThe fourth regular meeting of the House of<br />\nRepresentatives was held Wednesday, November 24. The debate, \"Resolved, That the<br />\nUnited States should intervene in the case of<br />\nCuba,\" was very spirited, and showed careful<br />\npreparation on the part of the debaters. That<br />\nthe debaters spoke with hardly any reference<br />\nto their notes was very gratifying, and added<br />\nmuch to the interest of the debate. The negative side, which consisted of Congressmen<br />\nGuggenheimer, Ross and Fischer, won the debate. The Censor, in his criticism, complimented the negative side on their earnest work<br />\nin preparation for the dabate. Congressman<br />\nFischer, he said, was very witty and effective<br />\nin his arguments. The affirmative side was<br />\nsomewhat handicapped by the absence of one<br />\nof their regular debaters. Congressman Lev-<br /><br />\nering was asked to fill the vacancy. The subject for debate at the next regular meeting of<br />\nthe House will be : \"Resolved, That capital<br />\npunishment should be abolished.\" The debaters will be : Affirmative \u2014 Congressmen<br />\nRemsen, Keidel and Welber. Negative\u2014Congressmen Murkland, Davidson and Krager.<br />\nThe House was favored with the presence of<br />\nDr. Greene and Dr. Vincent.<br />\n11EDICAL SCHOOL NEWS.<br /><br />\nDr. L. F.
