This<br />\nfund, supported by alumni<br />\ndonations, was organized by<br />\nthe Homewood deans in<br />\nresponse to concerns about<br />\ndeteriorating relations between<br />\nstudents and instructors.<br />\nThe new fund, which is currently limited to $5000 for this<br />\nsemester, is \"an attempt to increase informal interaction between faculty and students outside of the classroom,\" according to a memorandum released by Dean of the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences George<br />\nFisher and Dean of the Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering V. David<br />\nVandeLinde. Under the<br />\nguidelines of the fund, faculty<br />\nmembers may entertain a group<br />\nof students by having lunch or<br />\ndinner with them and the<br />\nuniversity will reimburse them<br />\nfor the cost. Each faculty<br />\n<br />\nmember and student may utilize<br />\nthe fund once per semester.<br />\nThe idea for this special fund<br />\nwas introduced by Student<br />\nCouncil President Jon Lana<br />\nwho read an article in the<br />\nChronicle ofHigher Education<br />\nabout a similar program recently initiated at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. Lana sent the artide to President Muller, the<br />\nDevelopment Office, and the<br />\nHomewood deans. All had<br />\nfavorable responses. Since October, the deans have discussed the feasibility of such a program and contacted administrators at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania for advice. Shortly after, the Student Council<br />\npassed a resolution supporting<br />\nthe idea. The program was<br />\napproved.<br />\nLana was very happy with<br />\nthe actions of the administration.

Junior Mike DeRosa and<br />\nsophomore Brad Marks, the<br />\nundergraduate chairmen of the<br />\n<br />\n1985 symposium, believe that<br />\nthis approach will be much<br />\nmore interesting than simply<br />\nhaving individual lectures on<br />\ncertain issues such as \"Star<br />\nWars\" or treaty verifiability.<br />\nDeRosa and Marks have set<br />\nan ambitious goal of getting<br />\nfive speakers instead of the<br />\nusual three for this year's symposium. While conducting their<br />\nsearch for speakers, they looked for well-known figures from<br />\ndifferent periods in U.S.-Soviet<br />\nrelations so that an overall<br />\nperspective could be obtained.<br />\nAll five speakers now under<br />\nconsideration have had experience working directly with<br />\nthe Soviets.<br />\nContinued on Page 7<br />\n<br />\nLarry Vo:z<br />\n<br />\nBrad Marks (left) and Mike DeRosa, Co-Chairmen of next year's Milton S.

He cited test results that<br />\nacid rain is causing sulfur and<br />\nnitrogen levels to increase in<br />\nmany rivers and lakes around<br />\nthe world. However, he emphasized that he is uncertain of<br />\nhow this will affect the environment in the long run.<br />\nHe also discussed land erosion, loss of tropical forests,<br />\nand polluted rivers and ground<br />\nwater. He feels that many of<br />\nthese problems are not as severe<br />\nas environmentalists claim, and<br />\nit might even be possible for<br />\npolluted rivers to clean<br />\nthemselves up.<br />\nFinally, Wolman addressed<br />\nhis third question: 'Have we<br />\nlearned anything, and are we<br />\ngaining or losing?\" He points<br />\nout that human beings have<br />\nchanged the earth for<br />\nthousands of years, \"and there<br />\nis no civilization without<br />\nchange.\" He concludes that we<br />\nmust be moving in the right<br />\ndirection on pollution, \"otherwise we would have been buried<br />\nby the millenium of waste we've<br />\nproduced.\"<br />\nTo answer the question<br />\ndirectly, are we gaining or losing, Wolman emphasized that<br />\nit depends on one's vantage<br />\npoint. What appears to be wore<br />\nto some people actually appears<br />\nbetter to others. To summarize<br />\nthe lecture, Wolman stressed<br />\nthe importance of pollution,<br />\nwhile at the same time dispelling some of the myths surrounding it. He concluded by saying, \"If you want to do<br />\nsomething for the environment,<br />\ngo around campus and pick up<br />\none more piece of trash than<br />\nyou dropped.

According to financial aid director Susan Broadbent, 632 students would<br />\npotentially be unable to return to Hopkins<br />\nin the fall if this proposal were to be approved. The alternative budget proposal, offered<br />\nby Republican representatives and due to be<br />\nconsidered by the Senate on April 22, is little better. Both plans place limits and ceilings on federal aid to individual students<br />\nwhich would make it extremely difficult for<br />\npoor and middle class families to afford<br />\neducation at a private university.<br />\nThis situation is intolerable. Regardless of<br />\ncost, the federal government must insure that<br />\nstudents in this country are adequately<br />\neducated. Philosophical and patriotic<br />\narguments notwithstanding, it is economically imperative that those individuals with the<br />\nability are trained and allowed to develop<br />\ntheir own talents. A person with the capacity to do college work and \"succeed\" after<br />\ngraduation is a valuable asset to this country not only in terms of his potential to contribute to the actual tax base, but also in his<br />\nability to contribute to the industrial community which supports that tax base.<br />\nThe reason the average undergraduate,<br />\nparticularly the average Hopk-ins<br />\nundergraduate, is not overly concerned with<br />\nthe slashing of financial aid programs is<br />\nrelatively simple. We have been raised in a<br />\nsociety which assumes that anyone capable<br />\nof completing a college education will be<br />\nallowed to do so. The idea of that opportunity being taken away is difficult to imagine. However, it is becoming increasingly<br />\nobvious that this is precisely what may happen within the next few weeks. Students must<br />\nspeak out against these developments and do<br />\n<br />\nso quickly.<br />\nThere are numerous ways to approach<br />\nthis. AmeriQuest was a reasonable and noble attempt. Student Council resolutions<br />\nlikewise brought the matter to general student attention. However, the individual<br />\nundergraduate, if so inclined, might write a<br />\nletter to his congressman or representative.<br />\nThis sounds admittedly trite, but it is a<br />\nsubstantial way to voice one's opinion.

Its text read:<br />\n\"Don't get mad\u2014Goetz even<br />\n(with the administration)\"; this<br />\nencaptioned a photograph of<br />\nBernhard Goetz emerging out<br />\nof a subway exit.<br />\nThose of us who read the<br />\nNews-Letter regularly may<br />\nalready be familiar with<br />\nMelnick's righi-wing clap-trap<br />\nfrom his frequent letters. But<br />\nthis poster speaks louder than<br />\nwords of the none-too-implicit<br />\nracism and demogoguery (not<br />\nto mention tastelessness) which<br />\nform Melnick's conception of<br />\npolitics. Melnick, echoing the<br />\nanalysis of the New York Post,<br />\net. al, presents to us a white<br />\nbusinessman who shoots down<br />\nunarmed black youths and then<br />\nshoots again, paralyzing one<br />\nfor good measure, as a herocrusader for justice. This media<br />\nmyth-making, which Melnick's<br />\nposter recapitulates, directly inverts the real question of<br />\njustice: that of a 'justice'<br />\nsystem which rules Goetz's<br />\ngreatest crime as being a<br />\nweapons violation, and of the<br />\njustice of a system which values<br />\nthe lives of four black youths at<br />\nless than five dollars (which is,<br />\nafter all, what they asked Goetz<br />\nfor).<br />\nMelnick takes things a step<br />\nfurther, however. He employs<br />\nGoetz as a political symbol:<br />\n'Goetz even', elect me. In this'<br />\nsense, however, the conjunction<br />\nof Goetz and a Lloyd Melnick<br />\nis not simply an aberration or<br />\n<br />\nment of Johns Hopkins stock<br />\n<br />\nContinued on Page 9<br />\n<br />\nVie i0opkint Pflug-latter<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nPessimism<br />\n<br />\nhowever.<br />\nSteve has been working in the<br />\nAlumni Office during the past<br />\nyear.

By this, I mean<br />\nthat student amenities are inadequate for a school of this<br />\nstature. While amenities<br />\nthemselves are a big problem<br />\nhere, of even more concern is<br />\nthe lack of an expressed interest<br />\nin non-classroom life by the administration and the improper<br />\nfunding of student activities<br />\nwhich is highly disproportionate to the efforts which involved students put into campus life.<br />\nWhile it is true that the<br />\nUniversity funds some important, and in my mind, requisite<br />\nfeatures of undergraduate life<br />\n<br />\nlike Orientation, the SAC,and<br />\nthe Tutorial, there are other<br />\nelements outside of class-life<br />\nwhich tend to slip by the school<br />\nbudget or which receive<br />\nminimal allocation. For instance, it seems irrational for<br />\nthe administration not to fund<br />\nthe Course Guide, which is entirely produced for students by<br />\nstudents. Rather, the SAC,<br />\nwhich gets an annual budget<br />\nfrom the school, must fund this<br />\nessential publication. Because<br />\nthe SAC must fund the gamut<br />\nof clubs, organizations, and the<br />\nlike, it is particularly unfair for<br />\nstudent activities money to be<br />\nused to support a publication<br />\nsolely dedicated to education.<br />\nSimilarly, the Student Council<br />\nCareer Advising Guide to Internships, which was funded<br />\nentirely by the Council, should<br />\nbe paid for by the administration. Both the Course Guide<br />\nand Internship Guide should be<br />\nfunded by the University<br />\nbecause both are concerned<br />\nwith educational pursuits.<br />\nWhile funding is a major<br />\nproblem, perhaps even more<br />\ndisturbing is the lack of initiative on the part of the<br />\nUniversity to do anything<br />\nsignificant in the way of improving student life. I do not<br />\nintent to slander those who<br />\nwork in the SAC office by any<br />\nmeans, but such things as a<br />\nhousing booklet and a security<br />\nmanual should be initiated by<br />\nthe administration, not by the<br />\nStudent Council. While Council has a responsibility to represent the student body and pur-<br />\n<br />\nsue salient issues, it and SAC<br />\ngroups cannot be expected to,<br />\nnor should have to, initiate,<br />\nproduce, and fund nearly all of<br />\nthe important undergraduate<br />\npublications, organizations, or<br />\nspecial projects. The administration, and by this I particularly mean the Deans, must<br />\nrealize that student obligations,<br />\nat least of those who are actively involved on campus in areas<br />\nother than just the classroom,<br />\nare greatly stretched. For<br />\nSpring Fair to be student initiated and run is wonderful,<br />\nbut should the same be said for<br />\nsecurity measures like quad<br />\nmonitors and security phones?<br />\nA line must be drawn between<br />\nwhat is fun, interesting, and<br />\nbeneficial to the community<br />\nand what is necessary,<br />\nobligatory, or essential to the<br />\nstudents on this campus. The<br />\nformer should remain funded<br />\nand organized as is, but the latter must be assumed by the<br />\nadministration.<br />\nI am among those who extol<br />\nand expect student involvement. Perhaps my best education has come from my \"nonacademic\" activities and the<br />\npeople with whom I have worked. However, I abhor the fact<br />\nthat too much is undertaken by<br />\nstudents because students<br />\nperceive the need for a certain<br />\npolicy to be addressed, like<br />\nsecurity or course evaluation,<br />\nwhen it is the responsibility of<br />\nthe University to see that such<br />\nmatters are handled under its<br />\nauspices.<br />\nIt is time for the school to<br />\n<br />\nwake up to the fact that<br />\nstudents want more than an<br />\neducation in the traditional<br />\nsense. It is time to realize that<br />\nportions of tuition should be<br />\ndirected towards students<br />\namenities, and more importantly, to student necessities. A<br />\ngood caveat is this: those<br />\namong the undergraduates who<br />\nare dedicated to student life are<br />\nfew, and while they are involved now, the possibility of equally dedicated and concerned individuals in coming years is, at<br />\nbest, uncertain. To avoid<br />\npotential problems with student<br />\napathy and student necessities,<br />\nthe administration must exercise geater interest and involvement in undergraduate life\u2014<br />\nbeginning now!<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJoff Masukawa<br />\n<br />\nFrom Off Campus<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing this letter in<br />\nhopes that I might alert my<br />\nfellow college students and the<br />\npublic at large to the budget<br />\nproposals concerning federal<br />\nstudent aid funds. I realize that<br />\nthese may not affect everyone<br />\nwho is reading this, but it will<br />\naffect about half of all college<br />\nstudents and their families.<br />\nThe President has proposed<br />\na flat limit of $4000 on federal<br />\ntuition aid to any one person<br />\nfor 1986. This may sound like<br />\na lot, but considering that college can costs upwards of<br />\n$15,000 per year, it is a mere<br />\n<br />\ndrop in the bucket for some.<br />\nAlso proposed are income ceilings for eligibility which would<br />\nprevent many current recipients<br />\nfrom obtaining grants and<br />\nguaranteed student loans. It<br />\nwill be argued, though, that not<br />\neveryone has the right to go to<br />\nHarvard or Yale (which both<br />\nprovide excellent financial aid<br />\nof their own)or any one of the<br />\nmore prestigious universities in<br />\nthis country. This is true for<br />\nacademic merit, but why should<br />\nsomeone be deprived of attending the school he will be happiest in or that will best suit<br />\nhim, or for that matter, any<br />\ncollege at all, because of financial poverty? Just because a<br />\nperson cannot afford a particular college doesn't mean<br />\nthat he would not become a<br />\nvaluable part of that college's<br />\nstudent body or of society.<br />\nIn the past few years, Congress has not accepted the first<br />\nproposals for students aid cuts,<br />\nbut to ensure that everyone retains the right to attend college,<br />\nI would suggest that everyone<br />\nwho reads this letter and holds<br />\nthe same views, cut it out and<br />\nmail it, or a letter of their own,<br />\nto President Reagan or their<br />\nrespective Congessman.

Robinson, Shambhala, $8.95<br />\nThis relatively short (179 pp)<br />\npaperback is the combined effort of a brain scientist (Sir<br />\nJohn Eccles) and a psychology<br />\nprofessor (Daniel Robinson).<br />\nWhat do these two men, wellrespected and famous in their<br />\nown fields, have to say about<br />\nThe Wonder of Being Human?<br />\nEccles and Robinson give a<br />\nlogical and philosophical<br />\npresentation of just what it is<br />\nthat distinguishes man from the<br />\nlower animals. Their nonexperimental, non-factual approach is not unprecedented:<br />\nEccles has used philosophy to<br />\n'explain' ideas seemingly<br />\nbeyond scientific enquiry<br />\nbefore, in his and Karl Popper's The Self and Its Brain. I<br />\nknow this because Self is the<br />\nsingle most cited reference in<br />\nthis lesser (in length, scope, ambition?) work. I found myself<br />\nwondering if Wonder isn't just<br />\nsome sort of review article for<br />\nSelf.<br />\nThis brings us to the issue,<br />\n\"What is the purpose of this<br />\nbook?\" and its corollary, \"For<br />\nwhom is this book intended?\"<br />\nThe authors stridently assert<br />\nthat they wish to speak to the<br />\ncommon person, presumably<br />\none of the ubiquitous<br />\n\"masses.\" Their introductory<br />\nchapter sets them the task of<br />\nrefuting a group of \"folk<br />\nphilosophies\"\u2014their term\u2014as<br />\n\"incoherent, implausible, or<br />\nprovably false.\" They wish to<br />\ndo this because they feel that<br />\nthese \"truisms\" or just<br />\n\"isms\"\u2014also their terms\u2014<br />\n<br />\n\"have much to do with the<br />\ndissatisfaction and aimlessness<br />\ninfecting modern life and that<br />\nthey deny the modern citizen<br />\nthe pleasure and happiness of<br />\nthe human adventure.\"<br />\nWith this in mind, the<br />\nauthors give a very general<br />\noverview of the accepted<br />\nbiological, evolutionarily and<br />\nindividually, development of<br />\nhuman beings. O.K. Personally, I found this unexciting\u2014<br />\nnothing I hadn't heard before,<br />\nunder more duress and certainly in more detail. I accepted<br />\nthat this book might be a little<br />\nbelow my level\u2014I mean this<br />\nnot in any condescending way,<br />\nbut only wish to note that I consider my education (thanks<br />\nprimarily to Hopkins, although<br />\nI hate to admit it) to be basically sound, in depth, and free<br />\nfrom uncritical bias.<br />\nThe book is not consistently<br />\nsimplistic, however. Chapter 3,<br />\n\"Self-Consciousness and the<br />\nHuman Person,\" presents Karl<br />\nPopper's (from Self) \"threeworld\"\u2014world<br />\n1 is matter/energy, world 2 is<br />\nconscious experiences, and<br />\nworld 3 is cultural knowledge.<br />\nThis concept, repeatedly<br />\nbrought up in succeeding<br />\nchapters, proved beyond my<br />\nunderstanding. So much for in<br />\ndepth education. I found<br />\nmyself skipping the figures in<br />\nthe same way I might when<br />\nreading a particularly boring<br />\nand abstruse text-book:<br />\ndiagrams and figures make the<br />\npage turning go so much faster.<br />\nI would describe the \"information flow diagram,\" but this<br />\nwould only serve to prove my<br />\nclaim further.

But, they should<br />\nalso be our friends, so their<br />\nstory is touching.<br />\nJohn D.

That much<br />\nis true. For a 24-hour diner (except Sunday nights), the Open<br />\nHouse bears little resemblance<br />\nto the chrome-and-steel diners<br />\nwhich now exist mainly in films<br />\nlike American Graffiti and<br />\nDiner. Built in 1949, the Open<br />\nHouse is a one-story brick cottage nestled in its own yard.<br />\nOne enters over a stone step<br />\nhollowed by a generation of<br />\ncustomers, and through an inner door.

Because Sunday nights<br />\nwere slow anyway, Brewer<br />\ndecided to close down at four<br />\non Sunday afternoons and not<br />\nreopen until Monday mornings<br />\nat seven. Much of the late afternoon is spent removing every<br />\npiece of kitchen equipment and<br />\nscraping away the grease and<br />\ngrime which has accumulated<br />\nduring the week.

Well, far, far,<br />\naway, about a light year from<br />\nthe sun, there is believed to be<br />\na ring of frozen chunks of matter comprising what is called the<br />\nOort cloud. It is thought that<br />\n100 billion (said Carl Sagan)<br />\nsnowballs exist out there in cold<br />\nstorage. The cross-sectional<br />\narea of Oort's cloud is so great<br />\nthat sometimes stars must move<br />\nthrough it on their way around<br />\nthe galazy. Roughly 3,000 stars<br />\nare postulated to have passed<br />\nthrough the inner cloud since<br />\nthe solar system formed. The<br />\ngravitation of the passing stars<br />\nperturbs the comets. Some<br />\ncomets escape into space<br />\nbecause of this, while others<br />\nmove inward toward the sun.<br />\nAccelerated by Jupiter, and<br />\neventually the sun, these comets are locked into elliptical orbits. Some comets have periods<br />\nof only a few years, like Enchke's which has a period of 3.3<br />\nyears, while others have periods<br />\nof several million.<br />\nWhile Sir Isaac Newton's<br />\ntheory of gravitation was in its<br />\nincubating test stages, a good<br />\nfriend of Newton's, Sir Edward<br />\nHalley (pronounced by most as<br />\n\"alley\")sought to explain some<br />\n<br />\nsymbol of evil, plague, and<br />\nfamine throughout the Middle<br />\nAges. One of the more interesting coincidences is the appearance of Halley's comet in<br />\nthe year of Mark Twain's birth<br />\nas well of his death.<br />\n<br />\nThere has been much discussion lately concerning the comet's luminosity. Comets lose a<br />\nlot of gas during each passage<br />\nand so they have less of their<br />\ngas to shed on future passages<br />\nto the sun. Some astronomers<br />\n<br />\nare saying that Halley's comet<br />\nwon't be as interesting to watch<br />\nthis time as it was in 1910. The<br />\nreason, they say, is that<br />\nHalley's will duck behind the<br />\nsun this time rather than pass in<br />\nfront of it. In addition, Earth<br />\n<br />\nwill be father away from the<br />\ncomet than it was in 1910. But<br />\nwait: some astronomers say<br />\nthat the core is vaporizing into<br />\na coma much more quickly<br />\nthan it should, making it 100<br />\ntimes brighter!

This is caused by the chemical breakdown<br />\nof bilirubin, a product of the<br />\n<br />\nred pigment of hemoglobin that<br />\nmakes up red blood cells. The<br />\nbaby's liver, which is<br />\npremature, has difficulty in<br />\ndisposing of this toxic bilirubin.<br />\nThis job is handled in the womb<br />\nby the mother's liver. If the<br />\nlevels of bilirubin in the blood<br />\nare too high, it can cross the<br />\nblood-brain barrier and actually destroy nerve cells in the<br />\nbrain. An exchange transfusion<br />\nof the baby's blood for a<br />\ndonor's was previously the only way to stall until the baby's<br />\nliver could function on its own.<br />\nThis is very stressful for any<br />\nbaby, but especially for a<br />\npremature baby.<br />\nIt was discovered by a nurse<br />\n<br />\nabout 30 years ago that babies<br />\nplaced next to the window in<br />\nthe nursery were less jaundiced<br />\nthan babies by the wall. She<br />\nwas insistent and finally got<br />\npeople interested in her findings. Lab technicians knew<br />\nalready that when bilirubin in<br />\nsolution is exposed ot light it<br />\ndecolorizes in a matter of<br />\nminutes. The chemical reasons<br />\nwere unknown but it was clear<br />\nthat when the right wavelength<br />\nof light is used, the bilirubin<br />\nbecomes nontoxic. This nontoxic substance can then be excreted in the bile without any<br />\nreally active participation by<br />\nthe<br />\nImmaturity,<br />\nliver.<br />\ntherefore, is not a problem.<br />\n<br />\nThis enormous technological<br />\nadvance allowed doctors to<br />\nstop treating babies with<br />\ncumbersome, difficult, and<br />\noften dangerous blood transfusions, and exchanged this<br />\ntechnique simply with exposure<br />\nto light. It took about 20 years<br />\nfor the chemical aspects to be<br />\nfigured out.

In 1682 Halley<br />\nnoticed that a comet had been<br />\nobserved in 1531, 1607, and in<br />\n1682.

This<br />\nfund, supported by alumni<br />\ndonations, was organized by<br />\nthe Homewood deans in<br />\nresponse to concerns about<br />\ndeteriorating relations between<br />\nstudents and instructors.<br />\nThe new fund, which is currently limited to $5000 for this<br />\nsemester, is \"an attempt to increase informal interaction between faculty and students outside of the classroom,\" according to a memorandum released by Dean of the School of<br />\nArts and Sciences George<br />\nFisher and Dean of the Whiting<br />\nSchool of Engineering V. David<br />\nVandeLinde. Under the<br />\nguidelines of the fund, faculty<br />\nmembers may entertain a group<br />\nof students by having lunch or<br />\ndinner with them and the<br />\nuniversity will reimburse them<br />\nfor the cost. Each faculty<br /><br />\nmember and student may utilize<br />\nthe fund once per semester.<br />\nThe idea for this special fund<br />\nwas introduced by Student<br />\nCouncil President Jon Lana<br />\nwho read an article in the<br />\nChronicle ofHigher Education<br />\nabout a similar program recently initiated at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. Lana sent the artide to President Muller, the<br />\nDevelopment Office, and the<br />\nHomewood deans. All had<br />\nfavorable responses. Since October, the deans have discussed the feasibility of such a program and contacted administrators at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania for advice. Shortly after, the Student Council<br />\npassed a resolution supporting<br />\nthe idea. The program was<br />\napproved.<br />\nLana was very happy with<br />\nthe actions of the administration.

Gordan Wolman, professor in the Department of Geography and<br />\nEnvironmental Engineering, delivering the first-ever Homewood Lecture.<br /><br />\nMSE Symp<br />\nConfirms<br />\n2 Speakers<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\nOne of the two speakers who<br />\nhas already been contracted is<br />\nPaul Warnke, negotiator of the<br />\nSALT II treaty under the<br />\nCarter administration. Warnke<br />\nwill discuss the strategies used<br />\nin dealing with the Soviet<br />\nUnion during the 1970's while<br />\nalso offering a comparison with<br />\nReagan's current policies.<br />\nThe other lecturer who has<br />\nbeen signed is Strobe Talbott,<br />\nthe Washington Bureau Chief<br />\nfor Time magazine. Talbott,<br />\nwho has written several books<br />\nabout arms control including<br />\nDeadly Gambits and The Russians and Reagan, is considered<br />\nto be an expert on the subject<br />\nand will focus his speech on<br />\ncurrent diplomatic strategies.<br />\nThe symposium chairmen are<br />\nalso confident that they can<br />\nsign two other very important<br />\nfigures. Robert McNamara,<br />\nSecretary of Defense during the<br />\nKennedy and Johnson administrations, would speak<br />\nabout arms control in the sixties and Paul Nitze who has<br />\nworked in the field of Soviet<br />\nrelations since the 1950's would<br />\npresent an overview on the last<br />\nweek of the series. Additionally, it is hoped that Robert<br />\nMcFarlane, the current National Security Advisor, will be<br />\navailable to speak along with<br />\nTalbott on the third week of the<br />\nseries.<br />\nMany format changes were<br />\nreviewed by the chairmen and<br />\nthe final decision was made to<br />\naugment the length of the series<br />\nfrom three lectures with three<br />\nspeakers, to four lectures and<br />\nfive speakers.<br />\nThe tentative schedule is<br />\nMcNamara on October 3rd,<br />\nWarnke on Oct. 9, Talbott and<br />\nMcFarlane on the 16th, and<br />\nNitze completing the talks on<br />\nOctober 23rd.

Colombo stated that<br />\nthis fund would \"give students<br />\nand faculty a chance to relate<br />\nnon-academically on a social<br />\nlevel.\"<br />\nThe success of the fund will<br />\nbe evaluated this summer.

He<br />\npointed out that the incidence<br />\nof cancer is not increasing in the<br />\npopulation if we account for<br />\nthe fact that we live longer, and<br />\nthat air pollution only accounts<br />\nfor 29% of all cancers.<br />\nNext, Wolman turned to acid<br />\nrain. He cited test results that<br />\nacid rain is causing sulfur and<br />\nnitrogen levels to increase in<br />\nmany rivers and lakes around<br />\nthe world. However, he emphasized that he is uncertain of<br />\nhow this will affect the environment in the long run.<br />\nHe also discussed land erosion, loss of tropical forests,<br />\nand polluted rivers and ground<br />\nwater. He feels that many of<br />\nthese problems are not as severe<br />\nas environmentalists claim, and<br />\nit might even be possible for<br />\npolluted rivers to clean<br />\nthemselves up.<br />\nFinally, Wolman addressed<br />\nhis third question: 'Have we<br />\nlearned anything, and are we<br />\ngaining or losing?\" He points<br />\nout that human beings have<br />\nchanged the earth for<br />\nthousands of years, \"and there<br />\nis no civilization without<br />\nchange.\" He concludes that we<br />\nmust be moving in the right<br />\ndirection on pollution, \"otherwise we would have been buried<br />\nby the millenium of waste we've<br />\nproduced.\"<br />\nTo answer the question<br />\ndirectly, are we gaining or losing, Wolman emphasized that<br />\nit depends on one's vantage<br />\npoint. What appears to be wore<br />\nto some people actually appears<br />\nbetter to others. To summarize<br />\nthe lecture, Wolman stressed<br />\nthe importance of pollution,<br />\nwhile at the same time dispelling some of the myths surrounding it.

According to financial aid director Susan Broadbent, 632 students would<br />\npotentially be unable to return to Hopkins<br />\nin the fall if this proposal were to be approved. The alternative budget proposal, offered<br />\nby Republican representatives and due to be<br />\nconsidered by the Senate on April 22, is little better. Both plans place limits and ceilings on federal aid to individual students<br />\nwhich would make it extremely difficult for<br />\npoor and middle class families to afford<br />\neducation at a private university.<br />\nThis situation is intolerable. Regardless of<br />\ncost, the federal government must insure that<br />\nstudents in this country are adequately<br />\neducated. Philosophical and patriotic<br />\narguments notwithstanding, it is economically imperative that those individuals with the<br />\nability are trained and allowed to develop<br />\ntheir own talents. A person with the capacity to do college work and \"succeed\" after<br />\ngraduation is a valuable asset to this country not only in terms of his potential to contribute to the actual tax base, but also in his<br />\nability to contribute to the industrial community which supports that tax base.<br />\nThe reason the average undergraduate,<br />\nparticularly the average Hopk-ins<br />\nundergraduate, is not overly concerned with<br />\nthe slashing of financial aid programs is<br />\nrelatively simple. We have been raised in a<br />\nsociety which assumes that anyone capable<br />\nof completing a college education will be<br />\nallowed to do so. The idea of that opportunity being taken away is difficult to imagine. However, it is becoming increasingly<br />\nobvious that this is precisely what may happen within the next few weeks. Students must<br />\nspeak out against these developments and do<br /><br />\nso quickly.<br />\nThere are numerous ways to approach<br />\nthis. AmeriQuest was a reasonable and noble attempt. Student Council resolutions<br />\nlikewise brought the matter to general student attention. However, the individual<br />\nundergraduate, if so inclined, might write a<br />\nletter to his congressman or representative.<br />\nThis sounds admittedly trite, but it is a<br />\nsubstantial way to voice one's opinion.

Its text read:<br />\n\"Don't get mad\u2014Goetz even<br />\n(with the administration)\"; this<br />\nencaptioned a photograph of<br />\nBernhard Goetz emerging out<br />\nof a subway exit.<br />\nThose of us who read the<br />\nNews-Letter regularly may<br />\nalready be familiar with<br />\nMelnick's righi-wing clap-trap<br />\nfrom his frequent letters. But<br />\nthis poster speaks louder than<br />\nwords of the none-too-implicit<br />\nracism and demogoguery (not<br />\nto mention tastelessness) which<br />\nform Melnick's conception of<br />\npolitics. Melnick, echoing the<br />\nanalysis of the New York Post,<br />\net. al, presents to us a white<br />\nbusinessman who shoots down<br />\nunarmed black youths and then<br />\nshoots again, paralyzing one<br />\nfor good measure, as a herocrusader for justice. This media<br />\nmyth-making, which Melnick's<br />\nposter recapitulates, directly inverts the real question of<br />\njustice: that of a 'justice'<br />\nsystem which rules Goetz's<br />\ngreatest crime as being a<br />\nweapons violation, and of the<br />\njustice of a system which values<br />\nthe lives of four black youths at<br />\nless than five dollars (which is,<br />\nafter all, what they asked Goetz<br />\nfor).<br />\nMelnick takes things a step<br />\nfurther, however. He employs<br />\nGoetz as a political symbol:<br />\n'Goetz even', elect me. In this'<br />\nsense, however, the conjunction<br />\nof Goetz and a Lloyd Melnick<br />\nis not simply an aberration or<br /><br />\nment of Johns Hopkins stock<br /><br />\nContinued on Page 9<br /><br />\nVie i0opkint Pflug-latter<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nPessimism<br /><br />\nhowever.<br />\nSteve has been working in the<br />\nAlumni Office during the past<br />\nyear.

By this, I mean<br />\nthat student amenities are inadequate for a school of this<br />\nstature. While amenities<br />\nthemselves are a big problem<br />\nhere, of even more concern is<br />\nthe lack of an expressed interest<br />\nin non-classroom life by the administration and the improper<br />\nfunding of student activities<br />\nwhich is highly disproportionate to the efforts which involved students put into campus life.<br />\nWhile it is true that the<br />\nUniversity funds some important, and in my mind, requisite<br />\nfeatures of undergraduate life<br /><br />\nlike Orientation, the SAC,and<br />\nthe Tutorial, there are other<br />\nelements outside of class-life<br />\nwhich tend to slip by the school<br />\nbudget or which receive<br />\nminimal allocation. For instance, it seems irrational for<br />\nthe administration not to fund<br />\nthe Course Guide, which is entirely produced for students by<br />\nstudents. Rather, the SAC,<br />\nwhich gets an annual budget<br />\nfrom the school, must fund this<br />\nessential publication. Because<br />\nthe SAC must fund the gamut<br />\nof clubs, organizations, and the<br />\nlike, it is particularly unfair for<br />\nstudent activities money to be<br />\nused to support a publication<br />\nsolely dedicated to education.<br />\nSimilarly, the Student Council<br />\nCareer Advising Guide to Internships, which was funded<br />\nentirely by the Council, should<br />\nbe paid for by the administration. Both the Course Guide<br />\nand Internship Guide should be<br />\nfunded by the University<br />\nbecause both are concerned<br />\nwith educational pursuits.<br />\nWhile funding is a major<br />\nproblem, perhaps even more<br />\ndisturbing is the lack of initiative on the part of the<br />\nUniversity to do anything<br />\nsignificant in the way of improving student life. I do not<br />\nintent to slander those who<br />\nwork in the SAC office by any<br />\nmeans, but such things as a<br />\nhousing booklet and a security<br />\nmanual should be initiated by<br />\nthe administration, not by the<br />\nStudent Council. While Council has a responsibility to represent the student body and pur-<br /><br />\nsue salient issues, it and SAC<br />\ngroups cannot be expected to,<br />\nnor should have to, initiate,<br />\nproduce, and fund nearly all of<br />\nthe important undergraduate<br />\npublications, organizations, or<br />\nspecial projects. The administration, and by this I particularly mean the Deans, must<br />\nrealize that student obligations,<br />\nat least of those who are actively involved on campus in areas<br />\nother than just the classroom,<br />\nare greatly stretched. For<br />\nSpring Fair to be student initiated and run is wonderful,<br />\nbut should the same be said for<br />\nsecurity measures like quad<br />\nmonitors and security phones?<br />\nA line must be drawn between<br />\nwhat is fun, interesting, and<br />\nbeneficial to the community<br />\nand what is necessary,<br />\nobligatory, or essential to the<br />\nstudents on this campus. The<br />\nformer should remain funded<br />\nand organized as is, but the latter must be assumed by the<br />\nadministration.<br />\nI am among those who extol<br />\nand expect student involvement. Perhaps my best education has come from my \"nonacademic\" activities and the<br />\npeople with whom I have worked. However, I abhor the fact<br />\nthat too much is undertaken by<br />\nstudents because students<br />\nperceive the need for a certain<br />\npolicy to be addressed, like<br />\nsecurity or course evaluation,<br />\nwhen it is the responsibility of<br />\nthe University to see that such<br />\nmatters are handled under its<br />\nauspices.<br />\nIt is time for the school to<br /><br />\nwake up to the fact that<br />\nstudents want more than an<br />\neducation in the traditional<br />\nsense. It is time to realize that<br />\nportions of tuition should be<br />\ndirected towards students<br />\namenities, and more importantly, to student necessities. A<br />\ngood caveat is this: those<br />\namong the undergraduates who<br />\nare dedicated to student life are<br />\nfew, and while they are involved now, the possibility of equally dedicated and concerned individuals in coming years is, at<br />\nbest, uncertain.

I realize that<br />\nthese may not affect everyone<br />\nwho is reading this, but it will<br />\naffect about half of all college<br />\nstudents and their families.<br />\nThe President has proposed<br />\na flat limit of $4000 on federal<br />\ntuition aid to any one person<br />\nfor 1986. This may sound like<br />\na lot, but considering that college can costs upwards of<br />\n$15,000 per year, it is a mere<br /><br />\ndrop in the bucket for some.<br />\nAlso proposed are income ceilings for eligibility which would<br />\nprevent many current recipients<br />\nfrom obtaining grants and<br />\nguaranteed student loans. It<br />\nwill be argued, though, that not<br />\neveryone has the right to go to<br />\nHarvard or Yale (which both<br />\nprovide excellent financial aid<br />\nof their own)or any one of the<br />\nmore prestigious universities in<br />\nthis country. This is true for<br />\nacademic merit, but why should<br />\nsomeone be deprived of attending the school he will be happiest in or that will best suit<br />\nhim, or for that matter, any<br />\ncollege at all, because of financial poverty? Just because a<br />\nperson cannot afford a particular college doesn't mean<br />\nthat he would not become a<br />\nvaluable part of that college's<br />\nstudent body or of society.<br />\nIn the past few years, Congress has not accepted the first<br />\nproposals for students aid cuts,<br />\nbut to ensure that everyone retains the right to attend college,<br />\nI would suggest that everyone<br />\nwho reads this letter and holds<br />\nthe same views, cut it out and<br />\nmail it, or a letter of their own,<br />\nto President Reagan or their<br />\nrespective Congessman. It may<br />\nnot provoke any radical<br />\nchanges in the opinions of our<br />\nleaders, but it will surely alert<br />\nthem to the fact that there are<br />\npeople who are concerned and<br />\ndisagree.<br />\nDavid L.

Robinson, Shambhala, $8.95<br />\nThis relatively short (179 pp)<br />\npaperback is the combined effort of a brain scientist (Sir<br />\nJohn Eccles) and a psychology<br />\nprofessor (Daniel Robinson).<br />\nWhat do these two men, wellrespected and famous in their<br />\nown fields, have to say about<br />\nThe Wonder of Being Human?<br />\nEccles and Robinson give a<br />\nlogical and philosophical<br />\npresentation of just what it is<br />\nthat distinguishes man from the<br />\nlower animals. Their nonexperimental, non-factual approach is not unprecedented:<br />\nEccles has used philosophy to<br />\n'explain' ideas seemingly<br />\nbeyond scientific enquiry<br />\nbefore, in his and Karl Popper's The Self and Its Brain. I<br />\nknow this because Self is the<br />\nsingle most cited reference in<br />\nthis lesser (in length, scope, ambition?) work. I found myself<br />\nwondering if Wonder isn't just<br />\nsome sort of review article for<br />\nSelf.<br />\nThis brings us to the issue,<br />\n\"What is the purpose of this<br />\nbook?\" and its corollary, \"For<br />\nwhom is this book intended?\"<br />\nThe authors stridently assert<br />\nthat they wish to speak to the<br />\ncommon person, presumably<br />\none of the ubiquitous<br />\n\"masses.\" Their introductory<br />\nchapter sets them the task of<br />\nrefuting a group of \"folk<br />\nphilosophies\"\u2014their term\u2014as<br />\n\"incoherent, implausible, or<br />\nprovably false.\" They wish to<br />\ndo this because they feel that<br />\nthese \"truisms\" or just<br />\n\"isms\"\u2014also their terms\u2014<br /><br />\n\"have much to do with the<br />\ndissatisfaction and aimlessness<br />\ninfecting modern life and that<br />\nthey deny the modern citizen<br />\nthe pleasure and happiness of<br />\nthe human adventure.\"<br />\nWith this in mind, the<br />\nauthors give a very general<br />\noverview of the accepted<br />\nbiological, evolutionarily and<br />\nindividually, development of<br />\nhuman beings. O.K. Personally, I found this unexciting\u2014<br />\nnothing I hadn't heard before,<br />\nunder more duress and certainly in more detail. I accepted<br />\nthat this book might be a little<br />\nbelow my level\u2014I mean this<br />\nnot in any condescending way,<br />\nbut only wish to note that I consider my education (thanks<br />\nprimarily to Hopkins, although<br />\nI hate to admit it) to be basically sound, in depth, and free<br />\nfrom uncritical bias.<br />\nThe book is not consistently<br />\nsimplistic, however. Chapter 3,<br />\n\"Self-Consciousness and the<br />\nHuman Person,\" presents Karl<br />\nPopper's (from Self) \"threeworld\"\u2014world<br />\n1 is matter/energy, world 2 is<br />\nconscious experiences, and<br />\nworld 3 is cultural knowledge.<br />\nThis concept, repeatedly<br />\nbrought up in succeeding<br />\nchapters, proved beyond my<br />\nunderstanding. So much for in<br />\ndepth education. I found<br />\nmyself skipping the figures in<br />\nthe same way I might when<br />\nreading a particularly boring<br />\nand abstruse text-book:<br />\ndiagrams and figures make the<br />\npage turning go so much faster.<br />\nI would describe the \"information flow diagram,\" but this<br />\nwould only serve to prove my<br />\nclaim further.

In other<br />\nwords, all hell breaks loose, and<br />\nour poor hero must set things<br />\naright to save his own skin.<br />\nWhen there is violence, sex, and<br />\ninteresting though unbelievable<br />\ncharacters, the publishing<br />\nhouse likes it even more.

It's the next to worst<br />\nthing on the \"I shouldn't be doing this\" list, behind television,<br />\nand it's at the top of the \"I<br />\nwant to do this\" list, so you<br />\nblow off all your work and<br />\nread. You don't want anything<br />\ndeep. The characters should be<br />\nintelligent, quick-witted, offbeat and interesting. In other<br />\nwords, they should be totally<br />\nunbelievable. But, they should<br />\nalso be our friends, so their<br />\nstory is touching.<br />\nJohn D.

It's more<br />\nfun than anything else that's<br />\nnot illegal, immoral, or fattening.

That much<br />\nis true. For a 24-hour diner (except Sunday nights), the Open<br />\nHouse bears little resemblance<br />\nto the chrome-and-steel diners<br />\nwhich now exist mainly in films<br />\nlike American Graffiti and<br />\nDiner. Built in 1949, the Open<br />\nHouse is a one-story brick cottage nestled in its own yard.<br />\nOne enters over a stone step<br />\nhollowed by a generation of<br />\ncustomers, and through an inner door. Running almost the<br />\nlength of the building, the<br />\npolished butcherblock counter<br />\nserves as a table for the fourteen red vinyl stools facing it.<br />\nSigns advertising the daily<br />\nspecials and other meals are<br />\nscattered haphazardly about the<br />\nwalls, along with a sign warning against serving minors during the schoolday curfew. The<br />\nChristmas decorations and four<br />\nplastic football-sized goldcolored stars have been up for<br />\nat least a year, according to a<br />\nfrequent customer.

Well, far, far,<br />\naway, about a light year from<br />\nthe sun, there is believed to be<br />\na ring of frozen chunks of matter comprising what is called the<br />\nOort cloud. It is thought that<br />\n100 billion (said Carl Sagan)<br />\nsnowballs exist out there in cold<br />\nstorage. The cross-sectional<br />\narea of Oort's cloud is so great<br />\nthat sometimes stars must move<br />\nthrough it on their way around<br />\nthe galazy. Roughly 3,000 stars<br />\nare postulated to have passed<br />\nthrough the inner cloud since<br />\nthe solar system formed. The<br />\ngravitation of the passing stars<br />\nperturbs the comets. Some<br />\ncomets escape into space<br />\nbecause of this, while others<br />\nmove inward toward the sun.<br />\nAccelerated by Jupiter, and<br />\neventually the sun, these comets are locked into elliptical orbits. Some comets have periods<br />\nof only a few years, like Enchke's which has a period of 3.3<br />\nyears, while others have periods<br />\nof several million.<br />\nWhile Sir Isaac Newton's<br />\ntheory of gravitation was in its<br />\nincubating test stages, a good<br />\nfriend of Newton's, Sir Edward<br />\nHalley (pronounced by most as<br />\n\"alley\")sought to explain some<br /><br />\nsymbol of evil, plague, and<br />\nfamine throughout the Middle<br />\nAges. One of the more interesting coincidences is the appearance of Halley's comet in<br />\nthe year of Mark Twain's birth<br />\nas well of his death.<br /><br />\nThere has been much discussion lately concerning the comet's luminosity. Comets lose a<br />\nlot of gas during each passage<br />\nand so they have less of their<br />\ngas to shed on future passages<br />\nto the sun. Some astronomers<br /><br />\nare saying that Halley's comet<br />\nwon't be as interesting to watch<br />\nthis time as it was in 1910. The<br />\nreason, they say, is that<br />\nHalley's will duck behind the<br />\nsun this time rather than pass in<br />\nfront of it. In addition, Earth<br /><br />\nwill be father away from the<br />\ncomet than it was in 1910. But<br />\nwait: some astronomers say<br />\nthat the core is vaporizing into<br />\na coma much more quickly<br />\nthan it should, making it 100<br />\ntimes brighter!

The<br />\nbaby's liver, which is<br />\npremature, has difficulty in<br />\ndisposing of this toxic bilirubin.<br />\nThis job is handled in the womb<br />\nby the mother's liver. If the<br />\nlevels of bilirubin in the blood<br />\nare too high, it can cross the<br />\nblood-brain barrier and actually destroy nerve cells in the<br />\nbrain. An exchange transfusion<br />\nof the baby's blood for a<br />\ndonor's was previously the only way to stall until the baby's<br />\nliver could function on its own.<br />\nThis is very stressful for any<br />\nbaby, but especially for a<br />\npremature baby.<br />\nIt was discovered by a nurse<br /><br />\nabout 30 years ago that babies<br />\nplaced next to the window in<br />\nthe nursery were less jaundiced<br />\nthan babies by the wall. She<br />\nwas insistent and finally got<br />\npeople interested in her findings. Lab technicians knew<br />\nalready that when bilirubin in<br />\nsolution is exposed ot light it<br />\ndecolorizes in a matter of<br />\nminutes. The chemical reasons<br />\nwere unknown but it was clear<br />\nthat when the right wavelength<br />\nof light is used, the bilirubin<br />\nbecomes nontoxic. This nontoxic substance can then be excreted in the bile without any<br />\nreally active participation by<br />\nthe<br />\nImmaturity,<br />\nliver.<br />\ntherefore, is not a problem.<br /><br />\nThis enormous technological<br />\nadvance allowed doctors to<br />\nstop treating babies with<br />\ncumbersome, difficult, and<br />\noften dangerous blood transfusions, and exchanged this<br />\ntechnique simply with exposure<br />\nto light. It took about 20 years<br />\nfor the chemical aspects to be<br />\nfigured out.

In 1682 Halley<br />\nnoticed that a comet had been<br />\nobserved in 1531, 1607, and in<br />\n1682. Halley concluded that<br />\nthese sightings were of the same<br />\ncomet, which had a period of<br />\napproximately 76 years. He<br />\npredicted that it would show up<br />\nagain in early 1759, much to the<br />\nmurmured scoffing of the<br />\npublic(\"How does he know?\"<br />\nthey probably asked.) and indeed it did.
