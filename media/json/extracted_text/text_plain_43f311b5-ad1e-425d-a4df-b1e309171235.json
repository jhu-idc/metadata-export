The new president concluded<br />\nhis speech by saying that the enduring traits be fostered at Hopkins<br />\nare: \"intellectual curiosity and discipline; intelligence trained at the<br />\nfrontiers of unfol ing knowledge but infused with humanity; dedication combined with objectivity; operational idealism; the search for<br />\ntruth, not only for its own sake but because, in the words adopted as<br />\nour motto, `the truth shall make you free.'\"<br />\nSeveral major themes ran through the hour long address, including<br />\nthe need for greater government involvement in financial funding to<br />\nprivate universities, the need for more interdisciplinary research, the<br />\nneed for greater university involvement in various aspects of public<br />\nservice, and the need for a greater emphasis on the humanities, the<br />\nsocial sciences and the undergraduate curriculum in general.<br />\nSignificantly, the subject of the federal government and its relations with the academic community appeared often throughout Dr.<br />\nGordon's speech. The new Hopkins president seemed well aware of<br />\nthe detrimental aspects of too much reliance of the government, and<br />\nmore than once he sounded the need to remain totally free of any<br />\ngovernment authority.<br />\nAt one point, Dr. Gordon suggested that \"the University should<br />\nnot become an agency for governmental operating functions, and<br />\nits organized work should conform to the long time-perspectives for<br />\nWhich its talents are peculiarly suited.\" Later, discussing the possibility of a center for the study of government institutions in Washington, Dr. Gordon stressed that \"this implies no subservience to government, no compromise of university independence of thought or<br />\nfreedom to criticize.\"<br />\nDiscussing the very possible crisis \"visible over the horizon,\" a<br />\ncrisis of lack of funds for the ever growing and ever demanding costs<br />\nof higher education,Dr. Gordon suggested three possibilities for ameliorating the self-strangulating financial situation at most universities.<br />\nFirst, he said corporate gifts,,should be greatly increased since the<br />\nuniversity is the breeding ground of those men who will take over the<br />\ncorporations. Secondly, he suggested the State should take a more<br />\nParticipatory role in funding, at least for a time.<br />\nThe third possibility cited by Dr. Gordon, and presumably the<br />\nmost vital and most probable, was that the federal government<br />\nShould participate more fully in financial help to universities. As he<br />\nsaid, the debate over the question of federal support \"concerns the<br />\nforms, the objectives, the allocating mechanisms,the balance between<br />\naccountability and independence, the volume and the timing.\" Furthermore, federal support \"should cover normal costs of instruction<br />\nand general operations in full, leaving endowment income and private gifts to be applied to innovation, experimentation, and the unending pursuit of excellence.\"<br />\nIt is significant that these recommendations came only weeks after<br />\nPresident Johnson's announcement of the very large cutbacks of<br />\nsupport to higher education, caused by the financial strain of the<br />\nvvar. Dr. Gordon suggested out hopefully more federal money will<br />\nbe forthcoming \"in the spring ;me which we all hope may ultimately<br />\nconic. with peace in Southeast Asia.\" There were several references<br />\nthroughout the speech to the university's role in a restless, warring<br />\nand alienated world on the edge of \"an all-destroying nuclear holocaust.\" With this premise in mind,Dr. Gordon made a strong affirmation of the importance for Hopkins to reject all ivory-towerism and<br />\ndedicate a large part of its research and work to the betterment of<br />\nhealth, urban problems and international discord.<br />\nThe proper role of the university in (social problems) is under intensive debate,\" Dr. Gordon said. \"There are legitimate fears that<br />\nill-considered acceptance of public service responsibilities may undermine the basic mission of the pursuit of learning. On the other hand,<br />\nespecially in the social sciences, where society itself is the laboratory<br />\nand where basic and applied research are scarcely distinguishable,<br />\nengagement on significant problems of the real world offers unique<br />\noPportunities for advancing knowledge and, infusing teaching with<br />\nmean ingful con ten t.\"<br />\nDr. Gordon enumerated four areas in which he would like to see<br />\ntile university further direct itself for public benefit: further public<br />\naid by the Hospital and the- School of Hygiene and Public Health; the<br />\nestablishment of a University Center of Urban Studies on the Homewood Campus; further expansion of the Washington Based School of<br />\n,i ,dvanced International Studies; and the founding of a universityi'ased graduate training school related to domestic social and political<br />\nconcerns.<br />\nDr. Gordon also called for stronger interdisciplinary thinking and<br />\naction, which has already been acted upon in part by the academic<br />\ncr;\u00b0Lincil's abolition of departmental majors. Much faculty thinking.<br />\nVr. Gordon asserted,\"must be done in groups which cross traditional<br />\noePartment al and divisional lines, with a corresponding readiness to<br />\nalter the institutional structure by consolidation and deletion as well<br />\nta;s by addition.\" In calling for the \"reintegration of knowledge,\" Dr.<br />\nordon said that \"One of the glories of the I lopkins is precisely the<br />\ncaPacity ti) develop fruit Fu l in tercouse among disciplines.\"<br />\n<br />\nStudents Score<br />\nDraft, Johnson,<br />\nIn Council Poll<br />\nSubstantial student opposition<br />\nto the draft and United States<br />\npolicy in Vietnam was revealed in<br />\nthe Student Council questionnaire<br />\nwhich was administered last week.<br />\nThe questionnaire also covered<br />\npoints concerning the CIA, campus issues artd the question of the<br />\nStudent Council's own stance in<br />\nrelation to national issues.<br />\nThe report on the poll, compiled by Greg Mertz, Bill Betcher<br />\nand Eric Howland, noted that a<br />\nmajority of those polled favored<br />\nwith drawal from Vietnam and that<br />\n90% were unhappy with President<br />\nJohnson's current policy concerning Vietnam.<br />\nThe report placed 65% of the<br />\nresponses in the \"dove\" category.<br />\nOver half of those who responded<br />\nfelt that United States policy in<br />\nVietnam was unjustified. . _<br />\nHowever, even in the light of<br />\nrecent rashes of demonstrations<br />\nagainst Dow Chemical Corporation's campus recruitment drive,<br />\n51% of responding Hopkins students approved of the use of<br />\nnapalm.<br />\nGeneral Lewis Hershey's recent<br />\norder to reclassify certain demonstrators against the Vietnam War<br />\nmet with heavy criticism. 82%<br />\nof the students, which represented<br />\nthe highest point of agreement on<br />\nany item in the poll, disapproved<br />\nof Hershey's action.<br />\nAlso concerning the draft, the<br />\nmost popular reform which was<br />\nadvocated in the poll was the establishment of a voluntary army,<br />\nnetting 36% of the responses. 23%<br />\nagreed with the present Selective<br />\nService law, while only 7% approved of the much publicized lottery<br />\nsystem, which is advocated by<br />\nmany leading educators, including<br />\nDr. Nathan Pusey of Harvard.<br />\nThe questionnaire noted a number of areas of campus issues<br />\nwhere students who responded to<br />\nthe poll felt that they should be<br />\ninvolved were institutional services, discipline and academic<br />\npolicy.<br />\nThe report concluded that \"92%<br />\nfelt that students should have a<br />\nvoice in one or more of the areas<br />\nlisted, and the majority felt that<br />\nthe students should have a voice in<br />\nall three.\"<br />\nTwo-thirds of those polled felt<br />\nthat the SC should take stands on<br />\nnational issues, but \"there was a<br />\ntrend toward basing stands on the<br />\nresults of surveys instead of using<br />\nthe council's own discretion.\"<br />\n<br />\nBy DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN<br />\nThe Milton S.

His topic will be<br />\n\"Stability and Change in the<br />\nAmerican City.\" Director of the<br />\nJoint Center for Urban Studies of<br />\nthe Massachusetts Institute of<br />\nTechnology and Harvard University, Dr. Moynihan has frequently<br />\nbeen at the center of controversy.<br />\nIn 1965, he authored a Labor Department study on \"The Negro<br />\nFamily: The Case For National<br />\nAction.\" The report which concluded that a leading factor behind<br />\npoverty, illiteracy and despair of<br />\nNegroes in urban ghettos was the<br />\ninstability of the Negro family r-s\u2022 In<br />\norder to alleviate these conditions,<br />\nMoynihan contended that a quest<br />\nfor equality and civil rights was not<br />\nenough. Preferential treatment, in<br />\nthe form of a far-reaching federal<br />\nprogram, was needed to alleviate<br />\nthose conditions. The report was<br />\n<br />\nRequirements Cut<br />\nIn New System<br />\nThe Committee on Undergraduate Studies has revamped the system of basic education requirements which are necessary for<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nThe changes make it no longer<br />\nnecessary for an undergraduate to<br />\ntake one year of history, philosophy,literature and natural science.<br />\nInstead, a student in one of the<br />\nnew area majors takes a set number of credits outside his own area.<br />\nIn the credits which a student takes<br />\noutside his own area, a certain<br />\nnumber of those credits must<br />\ncome from each of two areas outside his own.<br />\nFor example, a Social and Behavioral Science major must take<br />\n36 credits outside of SB. These<br />\ncredits are taken in either the<br />\nareas of Humanities, Natural<br />\nScience or Quantitative Studies \u2022<br />\nOut of these 36 credits, he must<br />\nhave at least 12 credits in two of<br />\nthose three areas.<br />\nThe stipulation that 12 credits<br />\nmust be taken in each of two areas<br />\noutside SB is only to insure that<br />\nan SB major does not take all 36<br />\noutside credits in just one area.<br />\nThe new arrangement, according to Dean Carl Swanson who initated the reform, allows a student<br />\nto mold his entire program around<br />\nhis own interests.<br />\nDean Swanson predicts that by<br />\n1971, when the present freshman<br />\nclass graduates, the departmental<br />\nsystem, which now exists, will be<br />\ncompletely phased out.<br />\nAll freshman and sophomore<br />\nadvisors will be fully briefed before the Spring advising period.<br />\nAdvisors will help students decide<br />\nwhether they wish to continue as<br />\na departmental major or enter in<br />\nthe fall as a new area major.<br />\nThe committee which instituted the changes, did so on the premise that \"there is no uniform<br />\npath to a liberal eduCation.\"<br />\n<br />\nattacked by Martin Luther King<br />\nwho feared that emphasis on alleged Negro weaknesses would be<br />\nused \"to justify neglect and rationalize oppression.\"<br />\nHarvard Prof<br />\n<br />\nDr. Moynihan was also Assistant Secretary of Labor from 19631965.

McCarthy has<br />\nstated that his goal is to take the<br />\nanti-war movement out of the<br />\nstreets and channel it into the legal<br />\npolitical process. If Mr. Witten's<br />\nstance is typical, he has succeeded.<br />\nThe issue of supporting or opposing McCarthy has nothing to<br />\ndo with \"purity\" versus \"realism,\"<br />\nunless you accept the power structure's definition of political reality. The power structure would<br />\nlike us to believe that fighting the<br />\nwar is the only realistic course. It<br />\nis realistic in terms of the power<br />\nstructure's profits, but since the<br />\nAmerican people value their own<br />\nlives more than corporate profits<br />\nthe power structure has been forced to retreat to its second line of<br />\ndefense. It would now have us believe that negotiations is the only<br />\nrealistic means. Again this is realistic if one does not want to challenge the system by which the<br />\npower structure profits. But those<br />\nwhose real aim is peace should<br />\nrealize that power structures respond to pressures rather than votes<br />\nand that elections are indices of<br />\npopular consciousness, not direct<br />\nmeans for change. Those whose<br />\ntrue aim is peace should recognize<br />\nthat the NLF is sincere when it<br />\nsays it will not negotiate with the<br />\nUnited States since the U.S. power<br />\nstructure has proven by its repeated violation of the Geneva Agreements that it cannot be trusted.<br />\nThe interests of peace are best<br />\nserved by militant opposition to<br />\nthe war through organizations independent of the power structure<br />\nand its political parties, under the<br />\ndemand of the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of U.S.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\ntroops from Vietnam.<br />\nStephen Diamond<br />\nPANNED OBSOLESCENE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article I wrote for the<br />\nNews-Letter of February 16 on<br />\nSenator McCarthy was written six<br />\nweeks ago. and it was obsolete before it appeared. At that time<br />\nMcCarthy's prospects did, indeed,<br />\nseem poor, to me and to many<br />\nothers who sympathize with the<br />\npositions the Senator has taken.<br />\nMcCarthy was then concentrating<br />\non building an organizational base,<br />\nand that task, crucial though it<br />\nwas, did not yield immediately apparent results. In the last few<br />\nweeks, the picture has changed<br />\nswiftly. The Senator's highly effective low-keyed campaign in New<br />\nHampshire - - which has received<br />\nvery little national publicity - plus the rather amateurish and undemocratic tactics of the Democratic regulars in that state (ranging from Gov. King's assertion that<br />\nany voter who votes for Eugene<br />\nMcCarthy is unpatriotic to a campaign of numbered pledge cards very clearly designed to evade the<br />\nfreedoms of the secret ballot - that<br />\nhas backfired very badly) have<br />\ncombined to give the Senator an<br />\nexcellent chance of a fine showing<br />\nin the state. ADA's endorsement<br />\nof McCarthy broadens his popular<br />\nbase and re-affirms what has long<br />\nbeen apparent: that for those who<br />\nwant to end the war now, McCarthy is the man. McCarthy has<br />\nbroadened his campaign to include<br />\ncomments on a wide range of issues; his remarks of farm policy,in<br />\nparticular, have met a good response in Wisconsin and Nebraska,<br />\ntwo critical primary states.

It was very good. So he<br />\nrested on the seventh day.<br />\nWho was the killer? He was<br />\nabout 41, with thinning, greasy<br />\nblack hair. He was probably a salesman full of good jokes, pot belly,<br />\nand rum smell. He had a wife,<br />\nwhom he stopped loving a long<br />\ntime ago,if he ever loved her at all,<br />\nand whose only purpose now was<br />\nto have dinner ready for him when<br />\nhe got home. He had three kids,<br />\ntwo boys and a girl, one of which<br />\nsmoked, another swore, and the<br />\nthird just wasn't talking to him<br />\nanyway.He had a house that looked pretty much like everyone<br />\nelse's, and he took good care of it,<br />\ntaking a lot of pride in his lawn of<br />\nBermuda Grass. It was possible<br />\nthat he was a member of some<br />\nCountry Club, where he played<br />\ngolf occasionally, never breaking<br />\none hundred but getting good at<br />\ndriving a Golf Cart. More than<br />\nlikely he went to church, after getting dressed up and smelling like<br />\nlime aftershave. He put a quarter<br />\ninto the bucket, and smiled benignly, and when he prayed he<br />\nusually shut his eyes and rubbed<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\nRoger C. Toll<br />\n<br />\nBreath of Fresh Air<br />\nAfter being armed with the light of the Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee Report of two years ago, the Academic Council went<br />\nforth into the night to search for the truth. And, as we all believe,<br />\nthe truth shall set us free. It appears that the Academic Council has<br />\nfound the truth, seen the light, and has become the prime mover in<br />\nHopkins' future.<br />\nLast week's decision to radically revamp undergraduate degree<br />\nrequirements comes as another in a series of pleasant surprises from<br />\nthe Academic Council. The new plan will ultimately sever the traditional and often shackling connection with academic departments.<br />\nInstead,the student will be free to major in \"area studies.\" Dropping<br />\nfreshman requirements will bring students much closer to the realization of \"graduate style\" college education.<br />\nThe Academic Council has acted where the Berkeley Muscatine<br />\nReport is still talking. Hopefully the Academic Council will continue<br />\nto inovate along the lines of the Pass-Fail reform and the recent<br />\ndecision. Much rhetoric has been blown about concerning the<br />\nalienation of students and the crime of over-specialization in<br />\neducational institutions. Changing degree requirements, involvement<br />\nin urban affairs, and minimizing government financial support all<br />\nlead to an academic freedom that is viable in the computer age.<br />\nUniversity administrations will not have to worry about student<br />\nunrest and discontent if educational reforms are continually studied<br />\nand instituted.<br />\nThe two decisions of the Academic Council serve the same<br />\npurpose, they broaden the possibilities for inter-disciplinary studies.<br />\nWe are experiencing the information deluge, and what is needed is<br />\nan academic Ark that will carry engineers as well as artists.<br />\nThe requirement changes will also multiply the possibilities for<br />\narea studies in departments not listed at Hopkins. The monopoly<br />\nhold on majors by the offices in Gilman Hall is broken. Students<br />\nwill, now be able to take studies in the area they are best suited for<br />\nand most interested in after having taken a sample of what the<br />\nUniversity has to offer.<br />\nThere are areas in which the Academic Council has not yet<br />\nmoved, but which bear action just as well. The subject of secret<br />\nresearch has apparently proved to be a hot potatoe,and the Council<br />\ndoes not feel it can get its hands burned at this stage. Still the<br />\nproblem remains at this University, where it is most repugnant.<br />\nIt seems that Hopkins is serving penance for the wrath it incurred<br />\nduring the political witch hunt in the 50's. We hope that the<br />\nAcademic Council will move to form a less contradictory policy<br />\nconcerning secret research.<br />\nAnother thorn in the side of academic integrity is government<br />\nfinancing. Last year 52% of the operating revenue for Hopkins came<br />\nfrom Washington. The Centennial Fund drive announced by Dr.<br />\nLincoln Gordon yesterday is a partial answer to the problem. If<br />\nindustry and business, two institutions which profit by education,<br />\ncan be mobilized into funding higher education, then less reliance<br />\nwould have to be placed on government money. Again freedom<br />\nwould be the most important product.<br />\nIn all, we are cheered by president Gordon inaugural speech and<br />\nby the Academic Council's rulings. We note that the somnambulists<br />\nin the AdministratiOn have given some indication of waking<br />\nfrom their sleep.<br />\n<br />\nIn so many ways the killer was<br />\njust another typically mindless<br />\nmember of the great society, as<br />\nbucolic and drooly as the day he<br />\nwas born.<br />\nSince this is such a liberal campus, right now you're saying:<br />\n\"Somebody ought to help the<br />\npoor bastards.\"<br />\nSomebody is, and they're doing<br />\nit right here at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nResistance and the Draft<br />\nThere must be an atmosphere of despair at Hopkins. Or perhaps<br />\nthere should be, but in the general who-cares atmosphere it passes<br />\nover the students unfelt. President Johnson's insane war in Asia,<br />\nseemingly escalated in hopes of a military victory that will save his<br />\nadministration's pride, now promises to continue its invasion of the<br />\nnation's youth and resources. It is no longer simply a war against communist forces in Vietnam; it also reaches the proportions of a war<br />\nagainst, not only dissent, but the people of this nation as well. Prime<br />\ntargets are today's students who are likely to be tomorrow's dead.<br />\nHowever, it is refreshing to know that there are some people at<br />\nHopkins who plan to do something about it. Members of the faculty,<br />\nwho in the past have shown reluctance to band together with the students in protest of an issue, are moving to fight Johnson's war in the<br />\narea where it will hurt the most - - draft resistance. Encouraged by<br />\nthe recent draft rulings and their anti-educational, anti-intellectual<br />\nbent, and by the appearance of Paul Lauter of RESIST, Joseph<br />\nWhitehill of the Writing Seminars along with other sympathetic professors are forming a group at Hopkins to vigorously thwart Selective<br />\nService policies. Hopefully, they will encourage over a hundred<br />\ngraduating students to turn in their draft cards.<br />\nThese intentions are fully justified. Johnson and his administration<br />\nhas refused to listen to what he terms as \"responsible dissent.\" The<br />\npleas of notable educators who have criticized the new Selective<br />\nService rulings havegone unheeded. The stands of Senators Fulbright,<br />\nMorse, Percy, and McCarthy along with other responsible \"doves\"<br />\nhave been ignored. The arrogant actions of the Johnson administration<br />\ncontinue. The administration refuses to discuss whether the war in<br />\nVietnam is, in fact, justified. They refuse to review a policy which is<br />\nnot only expending thousands of American lives, but is also destroying the fabric of life in America by rechanneling large amounts of our<br />\nresources into the fruitless Asian war.<br />\nIn the face of this arrogance, Lauter's byword of RESIST is the<br />\nonly alternative. It is Johnson and not the war protestors who has preempted the efficacy of using the so-called legal and responsible<br />\nchannels of dissent. Johnson, since his 1964 betrayal of those who<br />\nvoted for him as a peace candidate, has continued to make most<br />\npaths of dissent futile. The time is past for Americans who would only<br />\ndissent from war measures such as the draft; now it must be fought.<br />\n<br />\nUnder a $852,000 grant from<br />\nthe mental health branch of the<br />\nPublic Health Service, Johns Hopkins has established fellowships in<br />\nthe study of suicide and its prevention. This year's program has four<br />\n<br />\nfellows, a psychiatrist,a nurse, and<br />\ntwo sociologists.<br />\nDr. Seymour Perin, a Hopkin's<br />\ndirector of psychiatry, is the program director, and he claims that<br />\n\"it's been an extraordinarily successful program.\"<br />\nThis program has the purpose<br />\nof creating \"a cadre in a new profession\", as it is put, and giving<br />\nclassroom seminars and field work<br />\nin emergency suicide situations.<br />\nOther people will be trained, the<br />\n\"Gatekeepers\", the ones who hear<br />\nhints that a suicide is in the making - - the doctors, the police, the<br />\nmen of God. There will be followup programs for those suicides that<br />\nfail, as well as follow-up programs<br />\nfor the families of suicides.<br />\nDo not be surprised, if in the<br />\nfuture, we are subjected to a mass<br />\npropaganda movement designed to<br />\nhelp keep some poor slob alive a<br />\nlittle bit longer, just as we are<br />\nhealthier people because now we<br />\nknow of the dangers of heart disease, cancer, syphilis, and smoking.<br />\nThere are even tests going on to<br />\ntry to find out if depression is accompanied by a significant chemical change in the body.<br />\nIt is nice to know that some<br />\ndoctors somewhere in some office<br />\nwant to keep you around so that<br />\nyou can enjoy the blessings, of a<br />\nrich and varied life. Being the humanitarians that they are, these<br />\npeople will have an interest in you<br />\nand the way you want to live.<br />\nDon't let this mislead you. The<br />\n\"suicidologists\" as they are called,<br />\nare performing a beneficial service<br />\nto all of us. It just may be, though,<br />\nthat their arms could be accomplished through a different set of<br />\nmeans. Many knowledgeable people have claimed that the best way<br />\nto solve a problem is to eliminate<br />\nits causes, and face its people,<br />\nthere are lots of things wrong with<br />\nthe way life today is to convince<br />\nmany reasonable men that they are<br />\ntired of putting up with a lot of<br />\ncrap, not only somebody else's,<br />\nbut more importantly their own.<br />\nThe problem however, is'that<br />\nthere is someone reading this who<br />\nby next year will have taken a dive<br />\nfrom the Gilman Clock Tower,and<br />\nhe's saying - \"Somebody ought to help the<br />\npoor bastards.\"<br />\nHe likes the way he is now, too.<br />\n<br />\n[Wallace:'48 Repeater<br />\nBy KENNETH W. BOND<br />\nFor the second time Alabama's<br />\nGeorge Wallace has decided to bid<br />\nfor the White House. In 1964, he<br />\nwithdrew his candidacy soon after<br />\nBarry Goldwater's nomination became satisfactory to George's refined political tastes. This time,<br />\nhowever, to the disgrace and embarassment of the American electorate, Wallace is in for keeps: \"I<br />\nfully believe we can win!\" he recently shouted at a Washington<br />\npress conference. \"I am in the race<br />\nirrevocably.\u2014<br />\nWallace himself cannot be elected President, but he can certainly<br />\nwreck the outcome of the 1968<br />\nelection. With McCarthy challenging L.B.J. and Wallace fielding his<br />\nAmerican Independent Party, the<br />\npolarization around ideology is doing as much now, if not more than<br />\nin 1964, to break down the tenuous stability of the two party sustem. Thus, for the first time since<br />\n1824, there is a measureable possibility that if Wallace makes his<br />\n, word good, neither major party<br />\nwill succeed in forging a majority<br />\nof electoral college votes necessary<br />\nto elect a President. Then the you-<br />\n<br />\nknow-what hits the fan: the House<br />\nof Representatives will choose the<br />\nnext President according to constitutional dictates.<br />\nIt is difficult, indeed, to attach<br />\nany significant meaning to the nature of the Wallace candidacy. Presumably he was an all-right governor, but he lacks anything comparable to the vast political experience<br />\nand record of public service of a<br />\nNelson Rockefeller, Lyndon Johnson, or Richard Nixon. Compared<br />\nto other third-party candidates the<br />\nSouth has spawned, he possesses<br />\nneither the dedication for principles of a John C. Calhoun, nor the<br />\naristocratic defiance of a Strom<br />\nThurmond. lie's just a nice reactionary guy who doesn't like too<br />\nmuch Federal control and crime<br />\non our streets. And everyone's<br />\nagainst those kind of things.<br />\nThe alarming point which Wallace's bid does raise is the blatant<br />\ninadequacy of the present two party system to encompass and incorporate every last voter's peculiar<br />\nfeeling about a candidate and opinion on an issue.

With a<br />\nsonata each from the eighteenth,<br />\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mr. Szeryng displayed both his<br />\ntechnical abilities and his comprehensive understanding of the various styles.<br />\nBeginning with Brahms' Sonata<br />\nnumber 3 in D minor, he immediately revealed a controlled, precise<br />\ntone which, throughout the program, was marked by flexibility<br />\nand smoothness. He took advantage of the low, broad notes of the<br />\nopening sonata and revealed the<br />\nexpansive feeling of Brahms writing. The third movement, Un poco<br />\npresto e con sentimento, was easily likeable and a good selection<br />\nfor a program opener. The last<br />\nmovement was a well-written duet<br />\nbetween the violin and piano that<br />\nshowed the obvious compatability<br />\nbetween Mr. Szeryng and his capable accompanist, Mr. Charles<br />\nReiner.<br />\nThe second sonata on the program, number 2 in D Major by<br />\nSerge Prokofiev, was both technically and stylistically, the most demanding of the evening. But Mr.<br />\n<br />\nNichols: Gentle Touch<br />\nBy JAMES BENNETT<br />\nIt is perhaps axiomatic in the<br />\nextreme to suggest that the cinematic offerings of an Antonioni or<br />\na Godard often require a second<br />\nsitting in order for one to fully<br />\nsavor the subtle delicacies set before us. It would seem any accomplished foreign film director.<br />\nFellini for example, comes almost<br />\nby nature to handle sensitive symbolism in developing his latest<br />\nscreenplay much as any barefoot<br />\nbambino frolicking in the sunny<br />\nstreets of Naples would handle a<br />\nhealthy sized bottle of red wine neither would think of batting an<br />\nItalian eyelash at the thought.<br />\nAmerican productions, on the<br />\nOther hand, are an entirely different picture, for the necessary<br />\nnuances of artfully employed symbols inevitably come across with<br />\nall the engaging subtlety of a<br />\nmeat-ax. Hollywould just can't<br />\nseem to hack it.<br />\nEverything that should have<br />\nbeen said most probably has been<br />\nsaid about Mike Nichols' The<br />\nGraduate. Yes, it was wonderfully<br />\nfunnY, and yes, Dustin Hoffman.<br />\nWas perfectly cast as a sort of<br />\nYoung Sartre without his bearings.<br />\nBut the really spectacular point.<br />\nhas surprisingly slipped by all of,<br />\nmore discerning movie critics of<br />\nthis country.

And then Nichol's brilliantly and st ar tlingly switches the<br />\nLainera angle so that we view the<br />\n<br />\nworld through this lost boy's water<br />\ngoggles as he greets the guests - a<br />\nworld of middle-aged suburbanites<br />\ninveterately soused to the gills,<br />\ntheir fish puckered lips babbling<br />\ninaudibly for the soundtrack is<br />\nnow muted but for the gurgling of<br />\nthe oxygen tank strapped to the<br />\nback of a young man who has<br />\nentered a Cousteauian world of<br />\nutter silence.

And so after viewing<br />\nhis latest effort once and being<br />\nsomewhat turned off by what it<br />\nwas exactly that Mr. LeLouch was<br />\ntrying to say, one would quite<br />\nnaturally reason that since Mr.<br />\nLeLouch is an intellectual and<br />\nsince he is in there with Godard<br />\nthen there must have been something I missed that first time and<br />\nbesides, symbolically speaking,<br />\nforeign directors deserve a second<br />\nsitting anyway. And so I sat.<br />\nAnd as a result was beaten insensate over the head with symbolism<br />\nbut not before I had dropped<br />\nfrom my seat from sheer boredom.<br />\nIf Mr. Nichols' success exercises<br />\nany influence at all on American<br />\ndirectors then we should soon see<br />\na dramatic improvement in the<br />\nbalance of payments deficit hitting<br />\nour shores, if one can understand<br />\nLive For Life as the wave of the<br />\nfuture for foreign imports.<br />\n<br />\nSzeryng and Mr. Reiner responded<br />\nproportionately to the demands.<br />\nIt was in definite contrast to the<br />\nrest of the program; untraditional,<br />\nbut not really dissonant to the<br />\nmodern listener. The opening<br />\nmovement was pensive and had<br />\nthat \"Russian peasant' sound<br />\n(broad melodies with a roundabout way of getting from note<br />\nto note). Mr. Szeryng's sentiment<br />\nfor the music complemented Prokofiev's writing, presenting an antistic whole that was quite beautiful and profound.<br />\nAfter intermission, the scheduled program resumed with Motzart's sonata in B flat Major. As is<br />\noften the case with Motzart's writing, the sonata was a complete,<br />\ntightly organized package that was<br />\nthe perfection of symmeay.Called<br />\nout for encores, Mr. Szeryng chose<br />\nto \"continue the spell of Motzart\"<br />\nwith the adagio movement from<br />\nanother sonata, K. 481. He concluded with Brahms.

First, it hopes to impress<br />\nthe Democratic party by emphasizing the existence of a large liberal.<br />\nsentiment in the party. Secondly,<br />\nit is hoped that the revealed presence of liberal sentiment might<br />\nsomehow influence the Republican<br />\nparty to nominate a liberal candidate.

The new president concluded<br />\nhis speech by saying that the enduring traits be fostered at Hopkins<br />\nare: \"intellectual curiosity and discipline; intelligence trained at the<br />\nfrontiers of unfol ing knowledge but infused with humanity; dedication combined with objectivity; operational idealism; the search for<br />\ntruth, not only for its own sake but because, in the words adopted as<br />\nour motto, `the truth shall make you free.'\"<br />\nSeveral major themes ran through the hour long address, including<br />\nthe need for greater government involvement in financial funding to<br />\nprivate universities, the need for more interdisciplinary research, the<br />\nneed for greater university involvement in various aspects of public<br />\nservice, and the need for a greater emphasis on the humanities, the<br />\nsocial sciences and the undergraduate curriculum in general.<br />\nSignificantly, the subject of the federal government and its relations with the academic community appeared often throughout Dr.<br />\nGordon's speech. The new Hopkins president seemed well aware of<br />\nthe detrimental aspects of too much reliance of the government, and<br />\nmore than once he sounded the need to remain totally free of any<br />\ngovernment authority.<br />\nAt one point, Dr. Gordon suggested that \"the University should<br />\nnot become an agency for governmental operating functions, and<br />\nits organized work should conform to the long time-perspectives for<br />\nWhich its talents are peculiarly suited.\" Later, discussing the possibility of a center for the study of government institutions in Washington, Dr. Gordon stressed that \"this implies no subservience to government, no compromise of university independence of thought or<br />\nfreedom to criticize.\"<br />\nDiscussing the very possible crisis \"visible over the horizon,\" a<br />\ncrisis of lack of funds for the ever growing and ever demanding costs<br />\nof higher education,Dr. Gordon suggested three possibilities for ameliorating the self-strangulating financial situation at most universities.<br />\nFirst, he said corporate gifts,,should be greatly increased since the<br />\nuniversity is the breeding ground of those men who will take over the<br />\ncorporations. Secondly, he suggested the State should take a more<br />\nParticipatory role in funding, at least for a time.<br />\nThe third possibility cited by Dr. Gordon, and presumably the<br />\nmost vital and most probable, was that the federal government<br />\nShould participate more fully in financial help to universities. As he<br />\nsaid, the debate over the question of federal support \"concerns the<br />\nforms, the objectives, the allocating mechanisms,the balance between<br />\naccountability and independence, the volume and the timing.\" Furthermore, federal support \"should cover normal costs of instruction<br />\nand general operations in full, leaving endowment income and private gifts to be applied to innovation, experimentation, and the unending pursuit of excellence.\"<br />\nIt is significant that these recommendations came only weeks after<br />\nPresident Johnson's announcement of the very large cutbacks of<br />\nsupport to higher education, caused by the financial strain of the<br />\nvvar. Dr. Gordon suggested out hopefully more federal money will<br />\nbe forthcoming \"in the spring ;me which we all hope may ultimately<br />\nconic. with peace in Southeast Asia.\" There were several references<br />\nthroughout the speech to the university's role in a restless, warring<br />\nand alienated world on the edge of \"an all-destroying nuclear holocaust.\" With this premise in mind,Dr. Gordon made a strong affirmation of the importance for Hopkins to reject all ivory-towerism and<br />\ndedicate a large part of its research and work to the betterment of<br />\nhealth, urban problems and international discord.<br />\nThe proper role of the university in (social problems) is under intensive debate,\" Dr. Gordon said. \"There are legitimate fears that<br />\nill-considered acceptance of public service responsibilities may undermine the basic mission of the pursuit of learning. On the other hand,<br />\nespecially in the social sciences, where society itself is the laboratory<br />\nand where basic and applied research are scarcely distinguishable,<br />\nengagement on significant problems of the real world offers unique<br />\noPportunities for advancing knowledge and, infusing teaching with<br />\nmean ingful con ten t.\"<br />\nDr. Gordon enumerated four areas in which he would like to see<br />\ntile university further direct itself for public benefit: further public<br />\naid by the Hospital and the- School of Hygiene and Public Health; the<br />\nestablishment of a University Center of Urban Studies on the Homewood Campus; further expansion of the Washington Based School of<br />\n,i ,dvanced International Studies; and the founding of a universityi'ased graduate training school related to domestic social and political<br />\nconcerns.<br />\nDr. Gordon also called for stronger interdisciplinary thinking and<br />\naction, which has already been acted upon in part by the academic<br />\ncr;\u00b0Lincil's abolition of departmental majors. Much faculty thinking.<br />\nVr. Gordon asserted,\"must be done in groups which cross traditional<br />\noePartment al and divisional lines, with a corresponding readiness to<br />\nalter the institutional structure by consolidation and deletion as well<br />\nta;s by addition.\" In calling for the \"reintegration of knowledge,\" Dr.<br />\nordon said that \"One of the glories of the I lopkins is precisely the<br />\ncaPacity ti) develop fruit Fu l in tercouse among disciplines.\"<br /><br />\nStudents Score<br />\nDraft, Johnson,<br />\nIn Council Poll<br />\nSubstantial student opposition<br />\nto the draft and United States<br />\npolicy in Vietnam was revealed in<br />\nthe Student Council questionnaire<br />\nwhich was administered last week.<br />\nThe questionnaire also covered<br />\npoints concerning the CIA, campus issues artd the question of the<br />\nStudent Council's own stance in<br />\nrelation to national issues.<br />\nThe report on the poll, compiled by Greg Mertz, Bill Betcher<br />\nand Eric Howland, noted that a<br />\nmajority of those polled favored<br />\nwith drawal from Vietnam and that<br />\n90% were unhappy with President<br />\nJohnson's current policy concerning Vietnam.<br />\nThe report placed 65% of the<br />\nresponses in the \"dove\" category.<br />\nOver half of those who responded<br />\nfelt that United States policy in<br />\nVietnam was unjustified. . _<br />\nHowever, even in the light of<br />\nrecent rashes of demonstrations<br />\nagainst Dow Chemical Corporation's campus recruitment drive,<br />\n51% of responding Hopkins students approved of the use of<br />\nnapalm.<br />\nGeneral Lewis Hershey's recent<br />\norder to reclassify certain demonstrators against the Vietnam War<br />\nmet with heavy criticism. 82%<br />\nof the students, which represented<br />\nthe highest point of agreement on<br />\nany item in the poll, disapproved<br />\nof Hershey's action.<br />\nAlso concerning the draft, the<br />\nmost popular reform which was<br />\nadvocated in the poll was the establishment of a voluntary army,<br />\nnetting 36% of the responses. 23%<br />\nagreed with the present Selective<br />\nService law, while only 7% approved of the much publicized lottery<br />\nsystem, which is advocated by<br />\nmany leading educators, including<br />\nDr. Nathan Pusey of Harvard.<br />\nThe questionnaire noted a number of areas of campus issues<br />\nwhere students who responded to<br />\nthe poll felt that they should be<br />\ninvolved were institutional services, discipline and academic<br />\npolicy.<br />\nThe report concluded that \"92%<br />\nfelt that students should have a<br />\nvoice in one or more of the areas<br />\nlisted, and the majority felt that<br />\nthe students should have a voice in<br />\nall three.\"<br />\nTwo-thirds of those polled felt<br />\nthat the SC should take stands on<br />\nnational issues, but \"there was a<br />\ntrend toward basing stands on the<br />\nresults of surveys instead of using<br />\nthe council's own discretion.\"<br /><br />\nBy DAVID SCHNEIDERMAN<br />\nThe Milton S.

McCarthy has<br />\nstated that his goal is to take the<br />\nanti-war movement out of the<br />\nstreets and channel it into the legal<br />\npolitical process. If Mr. Witten's<br />\nstance is typical, he has succeeded.<br />\nThe issue of supporting or opposing McCarthy has nothing to<br />\ndo with \"purity\" versus \"realism,\"<br />\nunless you accept the power structure's definition of political reality. The power structure would<br />\nlike us to believe that fighting the<br />\nwar is the only realistic course. It<br />\nis realistic in terms of the power<br />\nstructure's profits, but since the<br />\nAmerican people value their own<br />\nlives more than corporate profits<br />\nthe power structure has been forced to retreat to its second line of<br />\ndefense. It would now have us believe that negotiations is the only<br />\nrealistic means. Again this is realistic if one does not want to challenge the system by which the<br />\npower structure profits. But those<br />\nwhose real aim is peace should<br />\nrealize that power structures respond to pressures rather than votes<br />\nand that elections are indices of<br />\npopular consciousness, not direct<br />\nmeans for change. Those whose<br />\ntrue aim is peace should recognize<br />\nthat the NLF is sincere when it<br />\nsays it will not negotiate with the<br />\nUnited States since the U.S. power<br />\nstructure has proven by its repeated violation of the Geneva Agreements that it cannot be trusted.<br />\nThe interests of peace are best<br />\nserved by militant opposition to<br />\nthe war through organizations independent of the power structure<br />\nand its political parties, under the<br />\ndemand of the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of U.S.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\ntroops from Vietnam.<br />\nStephen Diamond<br />\nPANNED OBSOLESCENE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe article I wrote for the<br />\nNews-Letter of February 16 on<br />\nSenator McCarthy was written six<br />\nweeks ago. and it was obsolete before it appeared. At that time<br />\nMcCarthy's prospects did, indeed,<br />\nseem poor, to me and to many<br />\nothers who sympathize with the<br />\npositions the Senator has taken.<br />\nMcCarthy was then concentrating<br />\non building an organizational base,<br />\nand that task, crucial though it<br />\nwas, did not yield immediately apparent results. In the last few<br />\nweeks, the picture has changed<br />\nswiftly. The Senator's highly effective low-keyed campaign in New<br />\nHampshire - - which has received<br />\nvery little national publicity - plus the rather amateurish and undemocratic tactics of the Democratic regulars in that state (ranging from Gov. King's assertion that<br />\nany voter who votes for Eugene<br />\nMcCarthy is unpatriotic to a campaign of numbered pledge cards very clearly designed to evade the<br />\nfreedoms of the secret ballot - that<br />\nhas backfired very badly) have<br />\ncombined to give the Senator an<br />\nexcellent chance of a fine showing<br />\nin the state. ADA's endorsement<br />\nof McCarthy broadens his popular<br />\nbase and re-affirms what has long<br />\nbeen apparent: that for those who<br />\nwant to end the war now, McCarthy is the man. McCarthy has<br />\nbroadened his campaign to include<br />\ncomments on a wide range of issues; his remarks of farm policy,in<br />\nparticular, have met a good response in Wisconsin and Nebraska,<br />\ntwo critical primary states.

Koper<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,FEBRUARY 23, 1968<br /><br />\nBy BILL SAKOWICH<br />\nThe killer awoke at dawn.<br />\nHe put his boots on.<br />\nHe took out a pencil and wrote<br />\na long letter that he hoped would<br />\nsay more, and then he<br />\nTook out his pistol, made sure<br />\nit was clean, and loaded the chambers, and then he<br />\nWent into the middle of his<br />\nroom to stalk his prey,and then he<br />\nShot himself.<br />\nAnd God from his exalted seat<br />\nin the mighty heavens looked down<br />\nupon that which he had made, and<br />\nbehold! It was very good. So he<br />\nrested on the seventh day.<br />\nWho was the killer? He was<br />\nabout 41, with thinning, greasy<br />\nblack hair. He was probably a salesman full of good jokes, pot belly,<br />\nand rum smell. He had a wife,<br />\nwhom he stopped loving a long<br />\ntime ago,if he ever loved her at all,<br />\nand whose only purpose now was<br />\nto have dinner ready for him when<br />\nhe got home. He had three kids,<br />\ntwo boys and a girl, one of which<br />\nsmoked, another swore, and the<br />\nthird just wasn't talking to him<br />\nanyway.He had a house that looked pretty much like everyone<br />\nelse's, and he took good care of it,<br />\ntaking a lot of pride in his lawn of<br />\nBermuda Grass. It was possible<br />\nthat he was a member of some<br />\nCountry Club, where he played<br />\ngolf occasionally, never breaking<br />\none hundred but getting good at<br />\ndriving a Golf Cart. More than<br />\nlikely he went to church, after getting dressed up and smelling like<br />\nlime aftershave. He put a quarter<br />\ninto the bucket, and smiled benignly, and when he prayed he<br />\nusually shut his eyes and rubbed<br />\nthem.<br /><br />\nRoger C. Toll<br /><br />\nBreath of Fresh Air<br />\nAfter being armed with the light of the Long Range Planning<br />\nCommittee Report of two years ago, the Academic Council went<br />\nforth into the night to search for the truth. And, as we all believe,<br />\nthe truth shall set us free. It appears that the Academic Council has<br />\nfound the truth, seen the light, and has become the prime mover in<br />\nHopkins' future.<br />\nLast week's decision to radically revamp undergraduate degree<br />\nrequirements comes as another in a series of pleasant surprises from<br />\nthe Academic Council. The new plan will ultimately sever the traditional and often shackling connection with academic departments.<br />\nInstead,the student will be free to major in \"area studies.\" Dropping<br />\nfreshman requirements will bring students much closer to the realization of \"graduate style\" college education.<br />\nThe Academic Council has acted where the Berkeley Muscatine<br />\nReport is still talking. Hopefully the Academic Council will continue<br />\nto inovate along the lines of the Pass-Fail reform and the recent<br />\ndecision. Much rhetoric has been blown about concerning the<br />\nalienation of students and the crime of over-specialization in<br />\neducational institutions. Changing degree requirements, involvement<br />\nin urban affairs, and minimizing government financial support all<br />\nlead to an academic freedom that is viable in the computer age.<br />\nUniversity administrations will not have to worry about student<br />\nunrest and discontent if educational reforms are continually studied<br />\nand instituted.<br />\nThe two decisions of the Academic Council serve the same<br />\npurpose, they broaden the possibilities for inter-disciplinary studies.<br />\nWe are experiencing the information deluge, and what is needed is<br />\nan academic Ark that will carry engineers as well as artists.<br />\nThe requirement changes will also multiply the possibilities for<br />\narea studies in departments not listed at Hopkins. The monopoly<br />\nhold on majors by the offices in Gilman Hall is broken. Students<br />\nwill, now be able to take studies in the area they are best suited for<br />\nand most interested in after having taken a sample of what the<br />\nUniversity has to offer.<br />\nThere are areas in which the Academic Council has not yet<br />\nmoved, but which bear action just as well. The subject of secret<br />\nresearch has apparently proved to be a hot potatoe,and the Council<br />\ndoes not feel it can get its hands burned at this stage. Still the<br />\nproblem remains at this University, where it is most repugnant.<br />\nIt seems that Hopkins is serving penance for the wrath it incurred<br />\nduring the political witch hunt in the 50's. We hope that the<br />\nAcademic Council will move to form a less contradictory policy<br />\nconcerning secret research.<br />\nAnother thorn in the side of academic integrity is government<br />\nfinancing. Last year 52% of the operating revenue for Hopkins came<br />\nfrom Washington. The Centennial Fund drive announced by Dr.<br />\nLincoln Gordon yesterday is a partial answer to the problem. If<br />\nindustry and business, two institutions which profit by education,<br />\ncan be mobilized into funding higher education, then less reliance<br />\nwould have to be placed on government money. Again freedom<br />\nwould be the most important product.<br />\nIn all, we are cheered by president Gordon inaugural speech and<br />\nby the Academic Council's rulings. We note that the somnambulists<br />\nin the AdministratiOn have given some indication of waking<br />\nfrom their sleep.<br /><br />\nIn so many ways the killer was<br />\njust another typically mindless<br />\nmember of the great society, as<br />\nbucolic and drooly as the day he<br />\nwas born.<br />\nSince this is such a liberal campus, right now you're saying:<br />\n\"Somebody ought to help the<br />\npoor bastards.\"<br />\nSomebody is, and they're doing<br />\nit right here at Homewood.<br /><br />\nResistance and the Draft<br />\nThere must be an atmosphere of despair at Hopkins. Or perhaps<br />\nthere should be, but in the general who-cares atmosphere it passes<br />\nover the students unfelt. President Johnson's insane war in Asia,<br />\nseemingly escalated in hopes of a military victory that will save his<br />\nadministration's pride, now promises to continue its invasion of the<br />\nnation's youth and resources. It is no longer simply a war against communist forces in Vietnam; it also reaches the proportions of a war<br />\nagainst, not only dissent, but the people of this nation as well. Prime<br />\ntargets are today's students who are likely to be tomorrow's dead.<br />\nHowever, it is refreshing to know that there are some people at<br />\nHopkins who plan to do something about it. Members of the faculty,<br />\nwho in the past have shown reluctance to band together with the students in protest of an issue, are moving to fight Johnson's war in the<br />\narea where it will hurt the most - - draft resistance. Encouraged by<br />\nthe recent draft rulings and their anti-educational, anti-intellectual<br />\nbent, and by the appearance of Paul Lauter of RESIST, Joseph<br />\nWhitehill of the Writing Seminars along with other sympathetic professors are forming a group at Hopkins to vigorously thwart Selective<br />\nService policies. Hopefully, they will encourage over a hundred<br />\ngraduating students to turn in their draft cards.<br />\nThese intentions are fully justified. Johnson and his administration<br />\nhas refused to listen to what he terms as \"responsible dissent.\" The<br />\npleas of notable educators who have criticized the new Selective<br />\nService rulings havegone unheeded. The stands of Senators Fulbright,<br />\nMorse, Percy, and McCarthy along with other responsible \"doves\"<br />\nhave been ignored. The arrogant actions of the Johnson administration<br />\ncontinue. The administration refuses to discuss whether the war in<br />\nVietnam is, in fact, justified. They refuse to review a policy which is<br />\nnot only expending thousands of American lives, but is also destroying the fabric of life in America by rechanneling large amounts of our<br />\nresources into the fruitless Asian war.<br />\nIn the face of this arrogance, Lauter's byword of RESIST is the<br />\nonly alternative. It is Johnson and not the war protestors who has preempted the efficacy of using the so-called legal and responsible<br />\nchannels of dissent. Johnson, since his 1964 betrayal of those who<br />\nvoted for him as a peace candidate, has continued to make most<br />\npaths of dissent futile. The time is past for Americans who would only<br />\ndissent from war measures such as the draft; now it must be fought.<br /><br />\nUnder a $852,000 grant from<br />\nthe mental health branch of the<br />\nPublic Health Service, Johns Hopkins has established fellowships in<br />\nthe study of suicide and its prevention. This year's program has four<br /><br />\nfellows, a psychiatrist,a nurse, and<br />\ntwo sociologists.<br />\nDr. Seymour Perin, a Hopkin's<br />\ndirector of psychiatry, is the program director, and he claims that<br />\n\"it's been an extraordinarily successful program.\"<br />\nThis program has the purpose<br />\nof creating \"a cadre in a new profession\", as it is put, and giving<br />\nclassroom seminars and field work<br />\nin emergency suicide situations.<br />\nOther people will be trained, the<br />\n\"Gatekeepers\", the ones who hear<br />\nhints that a suicide is in the making - - the doctors, the police, the<br />\nmen of God. There will be followup programs for those suicides that<br />\nfail, as well as follow-up programs<br />\nfor the families of suicides.<br />\nDo not be surprised, if in the<br />\nfuture, we are subjected to a mass<br />\npropaganda movement designed to<br />\nhelp keep some poor slob alive a<br />\nlittle bit longer, just as we are<br />\nhealthier people because now we<br />\nknow of the dangers of heart disease, cancer, syphilis, and smoking.<br />\nThere are even tests going on to<br />\ntry to find out if depression is accompanied by a significant chemical change in the body.<br />\nIt is nice to know that some<br />\ndoctors somewhere in some office<br />\nwant to keep you around so that<br />\nyou can enjoy the blessings, of a<br />\nrich and varied life. Being the humanitarians that they are, these<br />\npeople will have an interest in you<br />\nand the way you want to live.<br />\nDon't let this mislead you. The<br />\n\"suicidologists\" as they are called,<br />\nare performing a beneficial service<br />\nto all of us. It just may be, though,<br />\nthat their arms could be accomplished through a different set of<br />\nmeans. Many knowledgeable people have claimed that the best way<br />\nto solve a problem is to eliminate<br />\nits causes, and face its people,<br />\nthere are lots of things wrong with<br />\nthe way life today is to convince<br />\nmany reasonable men that they are<br />\ntired of putting up with a lot of<br />\ncrap, not only somebody else's,<br />\nbut more importantly their own.<br />\nThe problem however, is'that<br />\nthere is someone reading this who<br />\nby next year will have taken a dive<br />\nfrom the Gilman Clock Tower,and<br />\nhe's saying - \"Somebody ought to help the<br />\npoor bastards.\"<br />\nHe likes the way he is now, too.<br /><br />\n[Wallace:'48 Repeater<br />\nBy KENNETH W. BOND<br />\nFor the second time Alabama's<br />\nGeorge Wallace has decided to bid<br />\nfor the White House. In 1964, he<br />\nwithdrew his candidacy soon after<br />\nBarry Goldwater's nomination became satisfactory to George's refined political tastes. This time,<br />\nhowever, to the disgrace and embarassment of the American electorate, Wallace is in for keeps: \"I<br />\nfully believe we can win!\" he recently shouted at a Washington<br />\npress conference. \"I am in the race<br />\nirrevocably.\u2014<br />\nWallace himself cannot be elected President, but he can certainly<br />\nwreck the outcome of the 1968<br />\nelection. With McCarthy challenging L.B.J. and Wallace fielding his<br />\nAmerican Independent Party, the<br />\npolarization around ideology is doing as much now, if not more than<br />\nin 1964, to break down the tenuous stability of the two party sustem. Thus, for the first time since<br />\n1824, there is a measureable possibility that if Wallace makes his<br />\n, word good, neither major party<br />\nwill succeed in forging a majority<br />\nof electoral college votes necessary<br />\nto elect a President. Then the you-<br /><br />\nknow-what hits the fan: the House<br />\nof Representatives will choose the<br />\nnext President according to constitutional dictates.<br />\nIt is difficult, indeed, to attach<br />\nany significant meaning to the nature of the Wallace candidacy. Presumably he was an all-right governor, but he lacks anything comparable to the vast political experience<br />\nand record of public service of a<br />\nNelson Rockefeller, Lyndon Johnson, or Richard Nixon. Compared<br />\nto other third-party candidates the<br />\nSouth has spawned, he possesses<br />\nneither the dedication for principles of a John C. Calhoun, nor the<br />\naristocratic defiance of a Strom<br />\nThurmond. lie's just a nice reactionary guy who doesn't like too<br />\nmuch Federal control and crime<br />\non our streets. And everyone's<br />\nagainst those kind of things.<br />\nThe alarming point which Wallace's bid does raise is the blatant<br />\ninadequacy of the present two party system to encompass and incorporate every last voter's peculiar<br />\nfeeling about a candidate and opinion on an issue. Not that it indeed<br />\never did or ever will.

With a<br />\nsonata each from the eighteenth,<br />\nnineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mr. Szeryng displayed both his<br />\ntechnical abilities and his comprehensive understanding of the various styles.<br />\nBeginning with Brahms' Sonata<br />\nnumber 3 in D minor, he immediately revealed a controlled, precise<br />\ntone which, throughout the program, was marked by flexibility<br />\nand smoothness. He took advantage of the low, broad notes of the<br />\nopening sonata and revealed the<br />\nexpansive feeling of Brahms writing. The third movement, Un poco<br />\npresto e con sentimento, was easily likeable and a good selection<br />\nfor a program opener. The last<br />\nmovement was a well-written duet<br />\nbetween the violin and piano that<br />\nshowed the obvious compatability<br />\nbetween Mr. Szeryng and his capable accompanist, Mr. Charles<br />\nReiner.<br />\nThe second sonata on the program, number 2 in D Major by<br />\nSerge Prokofiev, was both technically and stylistically, the most demanding of the evening. But Mr.<br /><br />\nNichols: Gentle Touch<br />\nBy JAMES BENNETT<br />\nIt is perhaps axiomatic in the<br />\nextreme to suggest that the cinematic offerings of an Antonioni or<br />\na Godard often require a second<br />\nsitting in order for one to fully<br />\nsavor the subtle delicacies set before us.

At Grumman, engineers are involved in deep ocean technology...engineers see their advanced aircraft designs<br />\nproven daily in the air over Vietnam,and soon ...in outer space, the Grumman LM (Lunar Module) will land the astronauts on the lunar surfce. Grumman, situated in Bethpage, L.I. (30 miles from N.Y.C.), is in the cultural center of<br />\nactivity. Universities are close at hand for those who wish to continue their studies. C.C.N.Y., Manhattan College, New<br />\nYork University, Pratt Institute, Columbia University, State University at Stony Brook, Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Hofstra University and Adelphi College are all within easy distance. The surroundings are not hard to ta::e. Five<br />\nbeautiful public golf courses are in Bethpage\u2014two minutes from the plant. White sand beaches stretch for miles along<br />\nthe Atlantic (12 minutes drive).

According to Dr. Dickerman the impetus for forming the group came<br />\nas the result of a poll in which approximately seventy percent of<br />\nthose that had formed Scientists<br />\nand Engineers for Johnson-Humphrey in 1964 indicated that they<br />\nwould no longer be willing to support that ticket in the upcoming<br />\nelections.<br />\nDr. Dickerman went on to say<br />\nthat the group has a three-fold objective. First, it hopes to impress<br />\nthe Democratic party by emphasizing the existence of a large liberal.<br />\nsentiment in the party. Secondly,<br />\nit is hoped that the revealed presence of liberal sentiment might<br />\nsomehow influence the Republican<br />\nparty to nominate a liberal candidate. Finally, and most importantly, the group hopes to bring foreign<br />\npolicy into the realm of elective<br />\npolitics on a par with other issues<br />\nlike civil rights, welfare spending<br />\nand crime.<br /><br />\nRESIST Hopes<br />\nTo Gain Support<br />\n(Continued from Page 3)<br /><br />\nwill give the key-note address.<br />\n\"We Won't Go\"<br />\nStudents will have the opportunity to either return their draft<br />\ncards or \"We Won't Go\" pledges<br />\nin return for \"diplomas\" or \"NODraft Cards\".<br />\nIn addition to the commencement activities, RESIST will invite<br />\nclergy and parents of graduating<br />\nseniors to participate in workshops<br />\ncentering around American involvment in the Third World and<br />\nresulting internal difficulties.<br />\nMr. Lauter feels that coordinated organization of such activity<br />\nis of the utmost importance.<br />\n\"Within six to eight months,\" he<br />\ncontinued, \"this country will undergo a period of severe political<br />\nrepression\".<br />\nDespite the present ettorts of<br />\nRESIST Mr. Lauter said that he<br />\nremained pessimistic.
