The data was supplied<br />\nby an honorary member of the fraternity who beheld<br />\nand took part in its operations in what both he and this<br />\npaper profess to believe constituted its halcyon era.<br />\nSingularly enough, every detail he enumerated served<br />\nto bear out completely those contentions which we<br />\nvoiced in last Friday's issue. He explained that previously it was neither the pronounced nor unwritten policy<br />\nof the honorary to limit its membership to those students<br />\nwho had displayed ability in a number of heterogeneous<br />\nactivities, to the exclusion of that group which gave<br />\nunstintingly of its efforts to one particular organization<br />\nand achieved prominence therein. Quite to the contrary,<br />\nthe tendency was to enroll representatives of as many<br />\nindividual phases of undergraduate life under the 0.<br />\nD.

No activity or athletic<br />\nqualifications were compulsory here; preeminence in this<br />\none significant arena, plus a reputable character and a<br />\ndegree of initiative, constituted sufficient credentials.<br />\nA second point of departure from present standards<br />\nresided in the active participation of honorary faculty<br />\nmembers in the meetings and projects of 0. D. K. They<br />\ntook part in discussions, supplied information and registered their views by casting votes in exactly the same<br />\nmanner as student members.
