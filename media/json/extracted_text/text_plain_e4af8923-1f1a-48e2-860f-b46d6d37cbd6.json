Bascombe, who knew Dr.<br />\n<br />\nKing personally, spoke of him as<br />\nhaving a \"magnificent obsession - that life could for all men be significant, rewarding, and refreshing.\"<br />\nDisavowing the concept of<br />\nBlack Power, Bascombe viewed<br />\nthe situation in America as being<br />\none of White Power vs. Black<br />\nPoverty, with the great strength of<br />\nAmerica lying in the hands of the<br />\nwhites. The Negro finds himself in<br />\na deplorable state, but one which<br />\nhe is really incapable of solving<br />\nhimself. No Weapons<br />\nClaiming to be an advocate of<br />\nnon-violence, he admitted that the<br />\nNegro \"can't whip the white power structure. Even if he decided to<br />\nfight, the Negro in America has<br />\nnothing to fight with,\" he explained.

Prisoners indicate that the opponent has been<br />\ncut off, surrounded, lost his communications, given up.<br />\nIn point of fact what was accomplished at Khe Sanh was simply this - - five thousand Marines<br />\ntook a hell of a pounding, thus<br />\nproving their bravery (did anyone<br />\never doubt it?), in order to hold<br />\nonto a remote outpost of little<br />\nimportance, while the world's<br />\nmightiest nation employed the<br />\nworld's largest air force in the<br />\nworld's greatest bombardment to<br />\ndrive away x number of Asians<br />\npeasants. How many were driven<br />\naway we do not know, because no<br />\none ever got out there and counted them.<br />\nBravery thci was aplenty at<br />\nKhe Sanh,and Txrhaps bravery has<br />\nits own reward. But it is criminal<br />\nfor those who command the brave<br />\nto squander their courage. In December, 1944, the heroes of Bastogne accomplished much, for<br />\nthey broke the back of a German<br />\noffensive that potentially could<br />\nhave reversed the trend of the war.<br />\nIt mattered that Bastogne did not<br />\nfall. In coldly rational terms, it<br />\nmust be admitted that had Khe<br />\nSanh fallen, it would have made no<br />\nbasic difference to the American<br />\nposition in Viet Nam.<br />\nWhy, then, this enormous expenditure of force to hold it? Why<br />\nall the trumpeting about the great<br />\nvictory? Until and unless more information is forthcoming,it would<br />\nseem that in any realistic terms<br />\nthe victory was a sterile one.<br />\nBut there was one achievement.<br />\nWe did not suffer a Stalingrad or a<br />\nDien Bien Phu. President Johnson,<br />\n<br />\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General<br />\nWestmoreland, the whole military<br />\nestablishment had put our prestige<br />\non the line, and they can now<br />\nbreath easy, for face was saved.<br />\nBut it was their prestige, their face,<br />\nnot America's. The President demanded and got from the Joint<br />\nChiefs a written assurance that<br />\nKhe Sanh could be held; it will<br />\nsomeday, one supposes, be a treasured item in the archives of the<br />\nJohnson Library. Presumably his<br />\nfaith in the competence of his<br />\nmilitary advisers has gone up a<br />\nlittle.<br />\nAll Americans should realize<br />\nthat the victory at Khe Sanh was a<br />\nvictory for the Administration and<br />\nthe military establishment only.<br />\nThey gained something, but for<br />\nthe nation nothing positive was accomplished. Khe Sanh got us no<br />\ncloser to a military or any other<br />\nkind of victory in Viet Nam, did<br />\nnot improve America's strategic<br />\nposition in Southeast Asia or in<br />\nthe world, and did not get us any<br />\nnearer the solution of the problem of dealing with wars of national liberation.<br />\nDavid Douglas Duncan is a re<br />\ntired Marine Corps lieutenant col<br />\nonel who has just returned from<br />\nKhe Sanh. \"I am no kook,hippie,<br />\nhawk, or dove,\" he assures us in<br />\nhis recently published book, \"I<br />\nProtest,\" but he is furious over<br />\nwhat is going on. \"I protest the<br />\ntactics, I protest the destruction;<br />\nAnd I protest the war rhetoric.<br />\nHe finds it sad that the President<br />\nand the brass conceived of the<br />\nidea of \"hanging American prestige and honor and military valor<br />\non the defense of Khe Sanh,\" and<br />\npoints out that \"the Marines behind the sandbags at Khe Sanh<br />\nwere not overjoyed to be designated fenders of the national faith<br />\nby the President.\" All that coui<br />\nage, all that bloodshed, wasted. It<br />\nis a strange way to fight a war.<br />\n<br />\nlOne Hand Not Clapping<br />\nThis discussion,of course,returns to a familiar issue. In his speeches, Dr. Gordon has made it clear that he is not pleased about protests such as ones which had occured at places like Bowie, Berkeley<br />\nor Harvard. Instead, Dr. Gordon feels that grievances should be worked out through dialogue. By this time, Dr. Gordon knows that<br />\nHopkins is not about to erupt into mass protests, as illustrated by<br />\nthe spectacular failure of organizations like UDH. Therefore, we can<br />\nonly surmise that with this fear gone, Dr. Gordon feels he can safely<br />\ndispense with the \"dialogue\" as well. If this is not the case, then<br />\nDr. Gordon and the administration have made little effort to supply<br />\nevidence to the contrary. It is obvious, by now, that our administration is not going to take any initiative in this area.<br />\n<br />\nThis situation provides an opportunity, if not a last chance, for<br />\nthe Student Council, (are you there, boys?). They must share the<br />\nblame for this state of affairs since they theoretically are the only<br />\nrepresentative voice of the students. As kind (or pitying) as one may<br />\nwant to be to the Council, a review of the past year shows little<br />\nsignificant progress over the councils of past years. The Council, it<br />\nseems, fails to realize that the administration's attitude, as illustrated<br />\nby their recent actions, as an indication and a proof of the council's<br />\nineffectiveness. The familiar pattern reappears wherein the University grants concessions condescends to talk to the Council only when<br />\nthe administration is prepared for another divine act of\"grace.\" As<br />\na beginning, the Council should confront the Administration with<br />\nthe instances displaying University disregard concerning student actions. If the administration and Dr. Gordon continue to be unresponsive to the student body, the Council has the obligation, in behalf of the students, to condemn, the administration.<br />\n<br />\nWhile on this topic, it is pertinent to ask the Student Council<br />\nwhat happened that the Choice '68 election was held with almost no<br />\npublic notice. Over 1,000 college-level institutions participated in<br />\nthis poll which was timely and well-written. Somehow, we feel<br />\nashamed when Villa Julie College can attain an overwhelming vote<br />\nturnout, while at Hopkins, only a small number of the student body<br />\ncast their ballots because the Council failed to provide adequate<br />\npublicity.<br />\n<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nIn all honesty, this reviewer<br />\nnever saw Maharishi Mahesh Yogi<br />\n(the guru) and THE Beach Boys in<br />\nconcert - - because nothing on<br />\nearth could make him.<br />\n\"You're a bigot.\"<br />\nNo, no, I'm not.

A graduate of Syracuse<br />\nUniversity, where he earned three varsity letters, 23 year old Frank<br />\nComfort will assume the reins of the swimming team in the fall.<br />\nHe replaces popular Bill Klarner, who after a tenure of four seasons, will join the personnel department at Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nComfort comes to the Hop with superb credentials, having worked with AAU, YMCA and recreational teams in his Harrisburg, Pa.<br />\nhome. This year as a graduate student at North Carolina he coached<br />\nthe Tar Heel frosh in a successful campaign. As a full time staff member Comfort will teach Phys. Ed. classes, run recreational swimming<br />\nand coach frosh track. Mr. Comfort takes command of a team that<br />\nhad one of its finest seasons posting a 6-5 record.

Everyone was embarrassed. The Maryland<br />\nplayers sympathized with the visiting Navy, as well as the school administration, whose responsibility it was to maintain decorum. Particularly embarrassed, and irate, was Navy coach Bill Bilderback<br />\nwhose pants were splattered with eggs. Vowing never to bring a<br />\nteam back to College Park, Bilderback quickly got an apology from<br />\nthe President of the University.<br />\nThis behavior is totally unnecessary. Such incidents are a detraction from the game and a nuisance to the fans. Let's not have it happen here.

News-Letter predicts Hopkins over the war<br />\nmachine, 11-7<br />\n<br />\niThe Bad Guys<br />\nBy JASON KRAVITT,<br />\nLacrosse Manager<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins band has<br />\nplayed \"Ach du Liber Augustine\"<br />\nthree times this year in as many<br />\nhome games. What is significant is<br />\nthat the wily old band leader,<br />\nConrad Geblein, reserves this new<br />\ndimension in sound for the Blue<br />\nJay's 20th goal. The obvious conclusion is that the attack, led by<br />\ndead eye Phil Kneip, Downy (Harry) McCarty, and the irrepresible<br />\nJoe Cowan is pretty darn good. In<br />\nfact, they are terrific. Some people<br />\nhave gone so 'far as to compare<br />\nthem to the U.S. Calvalry, the<br />\nMagnificent Seven, the Good, the<br />\nBad, and the Ugly, and the U.S.<br />\nMarines. The Four Horsemen of<br />\nApocalypse might be a little more<br />\napt.<br />\nBut over-looked in all of this<br />\nmuch deserved fanfare is a defense<br />\nthat can rate itself one of the best<br />\nin the country. Certainly the team<br />\nitself is cognizant of how much<br />\nthe seasons' success owes to its<br />\nstingy defenders. A simple look at<br />\ngame balls proves this point.<br />\nTo begin with,I'd like to forget<br />\nabout the Mt. Washington game<br />\nexcept to point out that we lost<br />\nthat high scoring fracas largely because of the over-all team defense<br />\nwas not up to par. The Yale game<br />\nball went to a defenseman who did<br />\nnot suit up for he was in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer - - Ted<br />\nLeach. But the deserving senior<br />\nhad worked so hard to get himself<br />\ninto shape for the season, and had<br />\nlent so much of his spirit of dedication to the team, that Coach<br />\nScoot felt the team ought to dedicate its first triumph to Ted's<br />\nspirit.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 26, 1968<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\ncent game of his career, Paul Weiss<br />\nalso was awarded a game ball for<br />\nshutting out Ron Regan, a second<br />\nteam all-American attackman and<br />\nlast year's second highest scorer in<br />\nthe country. The achievement was<br />\nparticularly impressive when one<br />\nrealizes that Paul was a midfielder<br />\nlast year and had never played lacrosse before coming to Hopkins.<br />\nEven the referees were applauding Jeffery Berlin's awesome day<br />\nin the nets against a very strong<br />\nPrinceton team. On seven occasions the senior goal tender and cocaptain saved one on one shots.<br />\nAgainst Virginia, the extra-man<br />\ndefense was particularly tough, not<br />\nletting the extra Cavaliers score<br />\nonce. In this near rout, Willie<br />\nScroggs, a junior midfielder,<br />\nknocked down enough Cavaliers<br />\nto earn himself a game ball, the<br />\nother going to Downy McCarty<br />\nfor a fine 4 goal, 3 assist performance.<br />\nIn last week's routs, the scores<br />\nwere quite one sided and the ball<br />\nwas at the attack side of the field<br />\nso often that the defense almost<br />\nmissed the chance to work up a<br />\nsweat. Yet John Kelly received one<br />\nof the game balls in the Loyola<br />\nbattle for his stellar performance<br />\nof nine saves, Charlie Coker snaring the other for a feat so incredible I won't even try to describe it.<br />\nFinally, in the Pennsylvania<br />\ncontest, senior co-captain Wesley<br />\nBachur received a ball for his rugged aggressiveness and body checking as well as the wise old senior,<br />\nCarter, affectionately<br />\nBobby<br />\nknown as Savy, for his fine face-<br />\n<br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nIts early-season \"breathers\" out<br />\nof the way, the varsity lacrosse<br />\nteam's drive for a collegiate chamionship meets its first - - and<br />\nperhaps most formidable - - major<br />\nobstacle tomorrow, when it hosts<br />\nnational title contender Army at<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Cadets, 6-3 overall and a<br />\n12-9 loser to Hopkins last year,<br />\nsustained major losses from that<br />\n'67 group, but have managed to<br />\nrebuild in most impressive fashion.<br />\nSo effective, in fact, have been<br />\nArmy performances in 10-4, 12-4,<br />\n14-5, 10-5, and 9-4 wins over Yale<br />\n(taken 20-1 by Hopkins), Hofstra,<br />\nMaryland Lacrosse Club, Rutgers,<br />\nand Princeton (11-4) that Jay<br />\nCoach Bob Scott has termed<br />\n1968's West Point crew \"the best<br />\nArmy team of recent years\", one<br />\n\"capable of going all the way.\"<br />\nHomewood scouts, for their<br />\npart, appear to rate the Cadets at<br />\nleast on a par with Maryland and<br />\nNavy. Whether all this praise is<br />\nquite deserved would seem, from<br />\nthe scores above (Yale in particu-<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Rivals<br />\nWhite Sox Team<br />\nFor Winlessness<br />\n<br />\nlar) and some disparaging comments by Princeton Coach Ferris<br />\nThomsen about the Cadet showing<br />\nagainst his club, somewhat questable; but Army's major role in the<br />\ncollegiate title picture obviously<br />\nis not.

The Negro finds himself in<br />\na deplorable state, but one which<br />\nhe is really incapable of solving<br />\nhimself.

Where are the prisoners?<br />\nThey are always, even in Viet<br />\nNam, the best indicator of the<br />\nmagnitude of a victory, far more<br />\nsignificant than dead bodies, for<br />\ndead bodies only show that the<br />\nenemy's morale is high and he will<br />\ncontinue to fight on. Prisoners indicate that the opponent has been<br />\ncut off, surrounded, lost his communications, given up.<br />\nIn point of fact what was accomplished at Khe Sanh was simply this - - five thousand Marines<br />\ntook a hell of a pounding, thus<br />\nproving their bravery (did anyone<br />\never doubt it?), in order to hold<br />\nonto a remote outpost of little<br />\nimportance, while the world's<br />\nmightiest nation employed the<br />\nworld's largest air force in the<br />\nworld's greatest bombardment to<br />\ndrive away x number of Asians<br />\npeasants. How many were driven<br />\naway we do not know, because no<br />\none ever got out there and counted them.<br />\nBravery thci was aplenty at<br />\nKhe Sanh,and Txrhaps bravery has<br />\nits own reward. But it is criminal<br />\nfor those who command the brave<br />\nto squander their courage. In December, 1944, the heroes of Bastogne accomplished much, for<br />\nthey broke the back of a German<br />\noffensive that potentially could<br />\nhave reversed the trend of the war.<br />\nIt mattered that Bastogne did not<br />\nfall. In coldly rational terms, it<br />\nmust be admitted that had Khe<br />\nSanh fallen, it would have made no<br />\nbasic difference to the American<br />\nposition in Viet Nam.<br />\nWhy, then, this enormous expenditure of force to hold it? Why<br />\nall the trumpeting about the great<br />\nvictory? Until and unless more information is forthcoming,it would<br />\nseem that in any realistic terms<br />\nthe victory was a sterile one.<br />\nBut there was one achievement.<br />\nWe did not suffer a Stalingrad or a<br />\nDien Bien Phu. President Johnson,<br /><br />\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General<br />\nWestmoreland, the whole military<br />\nestablishment had put our prestige<br />\non the line, and they can now<br />\nbreath easy, for face was saved.<br />\nBut it was their prestige, their face,<br />\nnot America's. The President demanded and got from the Joint<br />\nChiefs a written assurance that<br />\nKhe Sanh could be held; it will<br />\nsomeday, one supposes, be a treasured item in the archives of the<br />\nJohnson Library. Presumably his<br />\nfaith in the competence of his<br />\nmilitary advisers has gone up a<br />\nlittle.<br />\nAll Americans should realize<br />\nthat the victory at Khe Sanh was a<br />\nvictory for the Administration and<br />\nthe military establishment only.<br />\nThey gained something, but for<br />\nthe nation nothing positive was accomplished. Khe Sanh got us no<br />\ncloser to a military or any other<br />\nkind of victory in Viet Nam, did<br />\nnot improve America's strategic<br />\nposition in Southeast Asia or in<br />\nthe world, and did not get us any<br />\nnearer the solution of the problem of dealing with wars of national liberation.<br />\nDavid Douglas Duncan is a re<br />\ntired Marine Corps lieutenant col<br />\nonel who has just returned from<br />\nKhe Sanh. \"I am no kook,hippie,<br />\nhawk, or dove,\" he assures us in<br />\nhis recently published book, \"I<br />\nProtest,\" but he is furious over<br />\nwhat is going on. \"I protest the<br />\ntactics, I protest the destruction;<br />\nAnd I protest the war rhetoric.<br />\nHe finds it sad that the President<br />\nand the brass conceived of the<br />\nidea of \"hanging American prestige and honor and military valor<br />\non the defense of Khe Sanh,\" and<br />\npoints out that \"the Marines behind the sandbags at Khe Sanh<br />\nwere not overjoyed to be designated fenders of the national faith<br />\nby the President.\" All that coui<br />\nage, all that bloodshed, wasted. It<br />\nis a strange way to fight a war.<br /><br />\nlOne Hand Not Clapping<br />\nThis discussion,of course,returns to a familiar issue. In his speeches, Dr. Gordon has made it clear that he is not pleased about protests such as ones which had occured at places like Bowie, Berkeley<br />\nor Harvard. Instead, Dr. Gordon feels that grievances should be worked out through dialogue. By this time, Dr. Gordon knows that<br />\nHopkins is not about to erupt into mass protests, as illustrated by<br />\nthe spectacular failure of organizations like UDH. Therefore, we can<br />\nonly surmise that with this fear gone, Dr. Gordon feels he can safely<br />\ndispense with the \"dialogue\" as well. If this is not the case, then<br />\nDr. Gordon and the administration have made little effort to supply<br />\nevidence to the contrary. It is obvious, by now, that our administration is not going to take any initiative in this area.<br /><br />\nThis situation provides an opportunity, if not a last chance, for<br />\nthe Student Council, (are you there, boys?). They must share the<br />\nblame for this state of affairs since they theoretically are the only<br />\nrepresentative voice of the students. As kind (or pitying) as one may<br />\nwant to be to the Council, a review of the past year shows little<br />\nsignificant progress over the councils of past years. The Council, it<br />\nseems, fails to realize that the administration's attitude, as illustrated<br />\nby their recent actions, as an indication and a proof of the council's<br />\nineffectiveness. The familiar pattern reappears wherein the University grants concessions condescends to talk to the Council only when<br />\nthe administration is prepared for another divine act of\"grace.\" As<br />\na beginning, the Council should confront the Administration with<br />\nthe instances displaying University disregard concerning student actions. If the administration and Dr. Gordon continue to be unresponsive to the student body, the Council has the obligation, in behalf of the students, to condemn, the administration.<br /><br />\nWhile on this topic, it is pertinent to ask the Student Council<br />\nwhat happened that the Choice '68 election was held with almost no<br />\npublic notice. Over 1,000 college-level institutions participated in<br />\nthis poll which was timely and well-written. Somehow, we feel<br />\nashamed when Villa Julie College can attain an overwhelming vote<br />\nturnout, while at Hopkins, only a small number of the student body<br />\ncast their ballots because the Council failed to provide adequate<br />\npublicity.<br /><br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nIn all honesty, this reviewer<br />\nnever saw Maharishi Mahesh Yogi<br />\n(the guru) and THE Beach Boys in<br />\nconcert - - because nothing on<br />\nearth could make him.<br />\n\"You're a bigot.\"<br />\nNo, no, I'm not.

Everyone was embarrassed. The Maryland<br />\nplayers sympathized with the visiting Navy, as well as the school administration, whose responsibility it was to maintain decorum. Particularly embarrassed, and irate, was Navy coach Bill Bilderback<br />\nwhose pants were splattered with eggs. Vowing never to bring a<br />\nteam back to College Park, Bilderback quickly got an apology from<br />\nthe President of the University.<br />\nThis behavior is totally unnecessary.

News-Letter predicts Hopkins over the war<br />\nmachine, 11-7<br /><br />\niThe Bad Guys<br />\nBy JASON KRAVITT,<br />\nLacrosse Manager<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins band has<br />\nplayed \"Ach du Liber Augustine\"<br />\nthree times this year in as many<br />\nhome games. What is significant is<br />\nthat the wily old band leader,<br />\nConrad Geblein, reserves this new<br />\ndimension in sound for the Blue<br />\nJay's 20th goal. The obvious conclusion is that the attack, led by<br />\ndead eye Phil Kneip, Downy (Harry) McCarty, and the irrepresible<br />\nJoe Cowan is pretty darn good. In<br />\nfact, they are terrific. Some people<br />\nhave gone so 'far as to compare<br />\nthem to the U.S. Calvalry, the<br />\nMagnificent Seven, the Good, the<br />\nBad, and the Ugly, and the U.S.<br />\nMarines. The Four Horsemen of<br />\nApocalypse might be a little more<br />\napt.<br />\nBut over-looked in all of this<br />\nmuch deserved fanfare is a defense<br />\nthat can rate itself one of the best<br />\nin the country. Certainly the team<br />\nitself is cognizant of how much<br />\nthe seasons' success owes to its<br />\nstingy defenders. A simple look at<br />\ngame balls proves this point.<br />\nTo begin with,I'd like to forget<br />\nabout the Mt. Washington game<br />\nexcept to point out that we lost<br />\nthat high scoring fracas largely because of the over-all team defense<br />\nwas not up to par. The Yale game<br />\nball went to a defenseman who did<br />\nnot suit up for he was in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer - - Ted<br />\nLeach. But the deserving senior<br />\nhad worked so hard to get himself<br />\ninto shape for the season, and had<br />\nlent so much of his spirit of dedication to the team, that Coach<br />\nScoot felt the team ought to dedicate its first triumph to Ted's<br />\nspirit.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, APRIL 26, 1968<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\ncent game of his career, Paul Weiss<br />\nalso was awarded a game ball for<br />\nshutting out Ron Regan, a second<br />\nteam all-American attackman and<br />\nlast year's second highest scorer in<br />\nthe country. The achievement was<br />\nparticularly impressive when one<br />\nrealizes that Paul was a midfielder<br />\nlast year and had never played lacrosse before coming to Hopkins.<br />\nEven the referees were applauding Jeffery Berlin's awesome day<br />\nin the nets against a very strong<br />\nPrinceton team. On seven occasions the senior goal tender and cocaptain saved one on one shots.<br />\nAgainst Virginia, the extra-man<br />\ndefense was particularly tough, not<br />\nletting the extra Cavaliers score<br />\nonce. In this near rout, Willie<br />\nScroggs, a junior midfielder,<br />\nknocked down enough Cavaliers<br />\nto earn himself a game ball, the<br />\nother going to Downy McCarty<br />\nfor a fine 4 goal, 3 assist performance.<br />\nIn last week's routs, the scores<br />\nwere quite one sided and the ball<br />\nwas at the attack side of the field<br />\nso often that the defense almost<br />\nmissed the chance to work up a<br />\nsweat. Yet John Kelly received one<br />\nof the game balls in the Loyola<br />\nbattle for his stellar performance<br />\nof nine saves, Charlie Coker snaring the other for a feat so incredible I won't even try to describe it.<br />\nFinally, in the Pennsylvania<br />\ncontest, senior co-captain Wesley<br />\nBachur received a ball for his rugged aggressiveness and body checking as well as the wise old senior,<br />\nCarter, affectionately<br />\nBobby<br />\nknown as Savy, for his fine face-<br /><br />\nBy MIKE PHILLIPS<br />\nIts early-season \"breathers\" out<br />\nof the way, the varsity lacrosse<br />\nteam's drive for a collegiate chamionship meets its first - - and<br />\nperhaps most formidable - - major<br />\nobstacle tomorrow, when it hosts<br />\nnational title contender Army at<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nThe Cadets, 6-3 overall and a<br />\n12-9 loser to Hopkins last year,<br />\nsustained major losses from that<br />\n'67 group, but have managed to<br />\nrebuild in most impressive fashion.<br />\nSo effective, in fact, have been<br />\nArmy performances in 10-4, 12-4,<br />\n14-5, 10-5, and 9-4 wins over Yale<br />\n(taken 20-1 by Hopkins), Hofstra,<br />\nMaryland Lacrosse Club, Rutgers,<br />\nand Princeton (11-4) that Jay<br />\nCoach Bob Scott has termed<br />\n1968's West Point crew \"the best<br />\nArmy team of recent years\", one<br />\n\"capable of going all the way.\"<br />\nHomewood scouts, for their<br />\npart, appear to rate the Cadets at<br />\nleast on a par with Maryland and<br />\nNavy. Whether all this praise is<br />\nquite deserved would seem, from<br />\nthe scores above (Yale in particu-<br /><br />\nHopkins Rivals<br />\nWhite Sox Team<br />\nFor Winlessness<br /><br />\nlar) and some disparaging comments by Princeton Coach Ferris<br />\nThomsen about the Cadet showing<br />\nagainst his club, somewhat questable; but Army's major role in the<br />\ncollegiate title picture obviously<br />\nis not.
