The College Humor number<br />\nwas good\u2014the best in fact that the Blue Jay staff has produced<br />\nduring our four years' sojourn at Homewood.<br />\nJust as a cow with any sense of tradition will hang herself<br />\nenough rope, it seems that the Jay staff, if given enough<br />\ngiven<br />\nif<br />\ntime, will put out a really clever number. Cynical as this statement may sound, it is not meant as an unkind criticism. How<br />\nundergraduates get out a comic magazine has always been beyond<br />\nus. Sitting down at a desk with copy due the next day and the<br />\nknowledge that you have got to be funny must produce an almost<br />\nincurably doleful frame of mind.<br />\nConsidering this, the Jay staff has always done well. Last<br />\nmonth they surpassed themselves with an issue equal to the best<br />\ncollege comic numbers we have ever seen. The entire staff has<br />\nearned high praise, but an extra share of the glory belongs to<br />\nBill Banks, whose drawings were the high spots of the number.<br /><br />\n\"MILWAUKEE\"<br />\nFrom various articles in today's issue, we learn that the Hopkins delegation has returned from the conference of the National<br />\nCouncil of Student Christian Associations in Milwaukee. From<br />\nwhat we can gather the meeting was a great success.

In addition, the delegates had a most enjoyable<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe conference, it is easily seen after a little reflection, represented months of planning, and a great deal Of work, time, and<br />\nmoney. For delegations from colleges as far from Milwaukee<br />\nas Hopkins, the last two items assume increased importance.
