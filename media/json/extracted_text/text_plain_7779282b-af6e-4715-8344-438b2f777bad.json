Victory was in sight; the students would<br />\nsoon abandon their occupation of the building.<br />\nThe move to seize New Africa House had<br />\nbeen swift , precipitated by two alleged incidents of racism on a campus already all too<br />\nfamiliar with that stigma.<br />\nLess than a week before the occupation of<br />\nNew Africa House began, two black students<br />\nreported that they had been accosted and beaten<br />\nby six white men apparently infuriated by the<br />\nfact that a white woman was with them.<br />\nTwo of the five students accused of the<br />\nbrutality were expelled,from campus residence<br />\nhalls, university officials said, and disciplinary<br />\nhearings have been scheduled. The sixth white<br />\nman accused of the attack is a high-school<br />\n<br />\nBut a repetition is exactly what minority<br />\nstudents say occurred, and this time they took<br />\naction. About 200 students\u2014black, Hispanic,<br />\nOriental, and American Indian\u2014marched to<br />\nNew Africa House, took over the building, and<br />\nlocked its massive black doors, vowing to stay<br />\nuntil the university answered their list of<br />\ndemands,\"We have been angered by racial and<br />\ncultural bigotry and violence that has been<br />\nallowed to run unchecked on a university campus which every day proclaims its commitment<br />\nto racial and cultural diversity,\" said the group<br />\nof protesters calling itself the \"Third World<br />\nCommunity.\"<br />\nAmong the demands of the group was the expulsion or suspension of the students involved<br />\nin the attack on the two black students, as well<br />\n<br />\nas the suspension of the policeman who had<br />\nrounded up black students for a lineup.<br />\nOther demands included the renovation of<br />\nNew Africa House and making it more of a<br />\ncultural center for minority students; the<br />\nrestoration of budget cuts by the Horace Mann<br />\nBond<br />\nCenter,<br />\na<br />\nre<br />\npository<br />\nof civil-rights<br />\nmaterials;<br />\nrevision of the student code to detail the consequences of racial violence or discrimination;<br />\nthe creation of new classes in the history and<br />\nculture of minority groups; and a 50-per-cent<br />\nincrease in the enrollment of minority students<br />\nand an increase in minority faculty and staff<br />\nmembers.<br />\nThe university has 24,000 students; 2,100,<br />\nor 9 per cent, are members of minority groups.<br />\nOf the minority students, about 640 are black.<br />\nThe students also demanded the creation of<br />\na monitoring group to insure that the demands,<br />\nonce agreed to, would be brought to fruition.<br />\nThe list of demands was sent to Chancellor<br />\nJoseph Duffey, who agreed to meet with the<br />\nprotesters. On two successive days he tried, but<br />\nwas turned away both times. He agreed to<br />\nthird meeting.<br />\nIn the meantime, the occupation remained<br />\npeaceful, even cordial at times.<br />\nWhen the students inside New Africa House<br />\nheard that Mr. Duffey's brother was ill, they<br />\nsent him a card expressing best wishes. Mr.<br />\nDuffey responded by sending them a fruit<br />\n<br />\nbasket.<br />\n'We Are Keeping Our Heads'<br />\n\"I was moved by their sending their card,<br />\nand I feel affection and respect for them,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"There are moments of frustration, but<br />\nI think we are all keeping our heads.\"<br />\nThe protesters kept a skeleton crew of one<br />\nto two dozen students inside the building at all<br />\ntimes during the sit-in, admitting only those<br />\npeople they wanted to come inside. Signs calling for the end oirk-ism dotted the grounds'<br />\naround the building, and groups of students,<br />\nmost of them white, periodically formed outside the building to voice their support.<br />\nDonations of food and warm clothing poured<br />\ninto the building.

This time comes every<br />\nnecessitate payment for it. The proposal four years, and when it comes, it<br />\nhaving been dropped, students might see is virtually impossible to read a<br />\nit as that much worse; here's a job that new magazine or watch the nighteveryone thinks is bad, but the University ly report without hearing mention<br />\nof it. That time has come again.<br />\nwon't even pay someone to do it.<br />\nI refer to Election 1988, of<br />\nThat's exactly why Weissman's proposal which you have already heard<br />\nwas dropped.,The Orientation chair is not close to your limit, I have no<br />\nsome horrific, slave-labor task. It is a doubt. But begrudge me a few<br />\npowerful position; the chairman, with the moments to belabor the issue.<br />\nhelp of many, is resonsible for presenting When I first wrote in this space<br />\nmonths ago, I discussed the<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University to incoming some<br />\nimportance of political involvefreshmen and their parents. Yes, it requires ment. It is time that I address the<br />\nmany long, hard hours; however, it is this subject again.<br />\nSomeone created a myth that<br />\nsacrifice on the part of the chairman and<br />\neveryone else which makes Orientation so single votes are assimilated by the<br />\nsystem and are therefore inspecial.<br />\nsignificant to the election. The<br />\nThere is nothing nicer than seeing famous paradox is, \"Would you<br />\nHopkins students knock themselves out to trade your right to vote for a new<br />\nmake the school's newcomers feel at car?\" \"Of course,\" comes the<br />\nhome\u2014and when done right, it is one class answer.\"My vote doesn't really<br />\nact. This year's Orientation, chaired by matter anyway.\"<br />\nIt is that myth that weakens the<br />\nLora Sims, has been evidence of that.<br />\npolitical infrastructure of this<br />\nWe hope that the talented members of the country. It is sad that many U.S.<br />\nundergraduate community will come out of pollsters consider one of the most<br />\nthe woodwork and take on the challenge of significant variables affecting an<br />\nOrientation chairman. Let's continue the election to be the weather on the<br />\ntradition of running a high-quality Orien- day of the vote. Truly, if rain is<br />\nenough to keep someone from<br />\ntation where students run it simply for its voting, how serious can they be<br />\nown sake, and await that week early next about the political process<br />\nSeptember during which there is no such anyway?<br />\nWe all have our favorite stories<br />\nthing as Hopkins apathy.<br />\ntold by high school civics<br />\nteachers about low voter turnout<br />\nin the U.S., but the percentage<br />\nitself is not so alarming as are the<br />\n<br />\nOne Class Act<br />\nSometimes that notorious Hopkins apathy<br />\nmakes itself even more apparent than usual<br />\naround here. This is just the case with the<br />\napplication for Orientation chairman.<br />\nResponse has been so poor that Student<br />\nCouncil Vice President Stephanie<br />\nWeissman has had to extend the application deadline.<br />\nPerhaps those who had considered applying turned cold to the idea once<br />\nWeisssman's recent proposal to Council for<br />\na paid Orientation chair was dropped.<br />\nGranted, the position requires an enormous<br />\namount of work during the summer, and<br />\nsummer employment is important for virtually every student. Furthermore, the<br />\ngeneral student attitude towards the job may<br />\nhave been altered once the possibility of<br />\nreimbursement was discussed.<br />\nTraditionally, the role of Orientation<br />\nchairman has been regarded as one of the<br />\n'student leader' roles on campus, analagous<br />\nto the MSE Symposium and Spring Fair<br />\nchairs. Students have vied for these<br />\nrespected positions.<br />\nProposing to pay the Orientation chairman might have cheapened the job. For<br />\nwhile the intentions were good and the<br />\nreasoning was logical, the proposal may<br />\nhave caused students to think that the job<br />\nis no longer considered to be on par with<br />\nthe likes of the MSE and Spring Fair positions, but is instead regarded by Council<br />\n<br />\nresults of the percentage. For<br />\nevery one person who does not<br />\nvote, the power of each cast ballot<br />\nis increased. In effect, every person that does not vote delegates<br />\ntheir right to those who do.<br />\nOne vote does count in this nation. We have the power to elect<br />\nour own government through the<br />\nElectoral College system, and it<br />\nis the ultimate hypocrisy to ignore<br />\nthat right. It is particularly<br />\nhypocritical to not vote and then<br />\nspend the entire term protesting<br />\nthe actions of the victor. The time<br />\nto act is now, when opinions really count\u2014not on campus next<br />\nyear, where opinions rarely go<br />\nbeyond Charles Street.<br />\nWorse than the apathetic who<br />\ndon't vote is the silent crowd<br />\nwhose mindset is apathetic, but<br />\nwho do vote. And yes, it is their<br />\nConstitutional right, but those<br />\npeople create a severe but<br />\nunderestimated threat to the<br />\npolitical stability of this nation<br />\nthrough their almost whimsical<br />\nvoting behavior. Many people<br />\ntend to remain absorbed in their<br />\ndaily lives and ignore the entire<br />\ncampaign, and they eventually<br />\nvote for the candidate who has the<br />\nnicest smile, the prettiest wife, or<br />\na donkey beside his name.<br />\nOften, we realize that we are<br />\nuninformed and try to pretend<br />\nthat we can still make effective<br />\nvoting decisions. That simply is<br />\nnot the case.

The period is important, because it is during this time that<br />\nthe pledge learns about, and hopefully<br />\nlearns to appreciate, that Greek organization to which he or she has made a commitment. Above all else, if brothers or<br />\nsisters cannot expose Greek values to their<br />\npledges, who will then carry them out as<br />\nthey themselves continue as members, the<br />\npledging has been a waste.<br />\nTraditions have evolved for brothers' and<br />\nsisters' behavior during pledge period to effectively instill these values in pledges.<br />\nDuties that are assigned to pledges are often<br />\nimportant in literally educating them in<br />\nfraternity history and tradition; activities<br />\nserve to educate pledges about brotherhood<br />\nand sisterhood in ways that often do not<br />\nbecome apparent until after pledge period<br />\nhas long been over.<br />\nPledge period's function, however, hardly runs contrary to good times\u2014neither do<br />\nfraternity values. The social atmosphere<br />\nmakes the experience all the more<br />\nworthwhile.<br />\nThe death of a Rutgers University<br />\nfreshman from alcohol poisoning stirred<br />\nRutgers to action. It has shut down the<br />\nfraternity in which the freshman was a<br />\npledge and temporarily suspended all frater-<br />\n<br />\nnity and sorority activities. Rutgers also announced that it would conduct an investigation to determine if the Greek system inherently put students at \"special risk.\" The<br />\nannouncement of the investigation comes<br />\nwith critical words of the system, even<br />\nbefore any work has begun.<br />\nHopkins faces the same potential problems by virtue of the fact that there is an<br />\nactive Greek system at Homewood.<br />\nPresently this system has a supportive,<br />\nalbeit pragmatic, relationship with the<br />\nHopkins community. An understanding has<br />\neffectively been reached on alcohol policy,<br />\nas self-policing remains a tenet of control.<br />\nThe Dean of Students office has also<br />\nroutinely sponsored substance abuse<br />\nawareness programs.<br />\nThere is no telling what kind of pressures<br />\nwould be exerted were a tragedy like that<br />\nwhich occured at Rutgers to be repeated at<br />\nHopkins.

My first<br />\ngirlfriend had only one dream: to<br />\nbecome a Suffolk County Police<br />\nOfficer. She was raised in the<br />\ntradition of civil service: One<br />\nbrother worked for the New York<br />\nCity Fire Department, and<br />\nanother was a New York City<br />\ncop. She had this dream, and on<br />\nLong Island, where the police are<br />\nthe highest paid in the country,<br />\nher goal was a common one. The<br />\ncourse of events in many young<br />\npeople's lives is to work only<br />\nlong enough after high school<br />\ngraduation to reach the magical<br />\nage of twenty-one, which, along<br />\nwith being the age of alcoholic<br />\nconsent, is also the minimum age<br />\nto enter the police academy.<br />\nConsequently the competition<br />\nis intense.ln my county, Suffolk,<br />\nwhere The police start at over<br />\n$26,000 and jump to $49,000 in<br />\nonly three years, there is given an<br />\nentrance test every four years,<br />\nfrom which an elegibility list is<br />\nestablished and kept until the next<br />\n<br />\nexamination. In April 1984, the<br />\nlast year in which the test was<br />\ngiven, 14,000 people took the exam, competing for an estimated<br />\n100 openings in the next four<br />\nyears. Therefore it is clear that<br />\nthe dreams of many a young person quickly come to naught.<br />\nThis is the atmosphere in which<br />\nI was raised. Then I came to<br />\nBaltimore, a mere 250 miles<br />\napart<br />\neons<br />\naway, but<br />\nmetaphysically. College dimmed<br />\nmy constabulatory desires for a<br />\nwhile, as I, along with my peers,<br />\nspent a good deal of time joking<br />\nabout the local police force, often<br />\nseen by Hopkins students as<br />\nboorish lumps who hang out in<br />\nWaWa,or who are regularly seen<br />\nsmoking cigarettes in CVP.

It did not. Spike<br />\nLee, in fact, has improved under<br />\nColumbia Pictures. School Daze<br />\nhad even more depth and new<br />\nideas than his first success, She 's<br />\nGotta Have It. John, you say that<br />\n\"the film is a lumbering and<br />\ndirectionless mess; it just doesn't<br />\nknow what it's about.\" You just<br />\ndon't know what it's about.<br />\nThis letter is not finished.<br />\nHowever, due to the NewsLetter's policy of 300 words maximum, we had to submit two letters. Please see \"Second Half.\"<br />\nE. Liza Trim<br />\n<br />\n'Daze' Credibility<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJohn, in your review, you incorrectly uses phrases like \"blacks<br />\nonly Mission College\" and<br />\n\"reverse racism.\" Mission College is not a blacks only college,<br />\nit is a predominantly black college. \"Blacks only\" implies that<br />\nit is not open to members of<br />\nanother race. As for reverse<br />\nracism, this involves more than<br />\none race. Reverse racism is a subject Lee chose not to address in<br />\nthis movie.<br />\nYou stated, \"Lee throws in<br />\nridiculous song and dance treatment.\" The songs' words, how<br />\nthey were sung, and the style of<br />\ndance performed emphasized the<br />\ndifference between the Jigaboos<br />\nand Wannabees. The song and<br />\ndance competition is symbolic of<br />\na very real class division which<br />\nexists among blacks. You also<br />\ncomplain about \"long, boring<br />\n<br />\nscenes which have nothing to do<br />\nwith the preceding portions.\"<br />\nPerhaps you didn't understand the<br />\npreceding portions and, out of<br />\nconfusion, found them boring.<br />\nYour stating that the movie had<br />\na \"totally incomprehensible. . .ending\" only reiterates the<br />\nfact that you didn't get the gist of<br />\nwhat the movie was saying.<br />\nSchool Daze portrayed many<br />\npreviously unaddressed problems<br />\nthat are present within the black<br />\ncommunity. This movie definitely<br />\nwas not a \"careless and confusing depiction of blacks.\" \"None<br />\nof the characters are credible?\"<br />\nSpeaking from first-hand experience, the characters are very<br />\ncredible. One of the biggest enjoyments of the movie was being<br />\nable to relate to so much that was<br />\noccurring on the screen.<br />\nSpike Lee was far from being<br />\n\"wrapped up with fulfilling some<br />\nesoteric delusion.\" Many who<br />\nare very familiar with the black<br />\ncommunity and its diverse forms<br />\ncan relate to what Lee portrayed.<br />\nJohn, Lee did not \"falter,\" but<br />\nrather, you faltered when you<br />\nwrote this review without doing<br />\nyour homework. Please first find<br />\nout about the real and diverse<br />\nproblems that exist among blacks<br />\nbefore criticizing what you deem<br />\nto be a \"careless and confusing<br />\ndepiction of blacks.\" John Park,<br />\n\"Wake Up.\"<br />\n<br />\nto make is the fact that Mr. Park<br />\nfeels that the movie \"just doesn't<br />\nknow what it's about.\" That<br />\nstatement in itself infuriates me.<br />\nIf Mr. Park would have invested<br />\na little research and time before<br />\nviewing the film, it would have<br />\nbeen quite obvious that the movie<br />\nwas about the ways that some<br />\nBlacks separate and classify<br />\nthemselves; be it by money, hair<br />\ntexture, education, skin tone, or<br />\nthe extent to which one has been<br />\n'urbanized.' This movie was<br />\nmade in order for people,<br />\nespecially Black people, to see the<br />\nwrong in the petty divisions<br />\nwithin the Black race. Mr. Lee<br />\nhad to pigeonhole Black people<br />\ninto various stereotypes in order<br />\nto emphasize this point. Furthermore, this movie has no reason<br />\nto be compared with \"Hollywood<br />\nShuffle,\" which illustrated the<br />\ntypecasting of Blacks by<br />\nHollywood. Their messages are<br />\nnot comparable.<br />\nFinally, and most importantly,<br />\nthe last line.of the film, \"Wake<br />\nup,\" summarizes Lee's whole intent of the movie. If Mr. Park<br />\nwould have in fact understood the<br />\nfilm he would have found the last<br />\nline quite \"a propos.\"<br />\nGeorgette B. Gaslcin<br />\n<br />\nAppropriate Programs<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nMonique R. Daniels<br />\n<br />\n'Daze' Relevancy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to the<br />\nreview of Spike Lee's film<br />\n\"School Daze\" by Mr. John<br />\nPark, and would like to set a few<br />\nthings straight. First of all, Mission College is not a \"Blacksonly college,\" it is a<br />\npredominantly Black school<br />\nwhich was founded around the<br />\nturn of the century (as were most<br />\npredominantly Black colleges) in<br />\norder to give Blacks a chance to<br />\nreceive a formal education. If one<br />\nhas enough insight as to even try<br />\nto remember the fact that Blacks,<br />\non the whole, were not allowed<br />\nto attend schools that Whites attended until the late 1950's, one<br />\nwould be able to see why these<br />\ncolleges were needed. In fact,<br />\nthese schools were financed, for<br />\nthe most part, by White philanthropists who believed in the<br />\neducation of all American<br />\ncitizens. Furthermore, today<br />\nthese schools are attended by people of various races.<br />\nSecondly, what did Mr. Park<br />\nmean by the statement \"reverse<br />\nracism?\" Did he mean that the<br />\nBlacks in the film were<br />\ndiscriminating against Whites?<br />\nWell, I find it quite humorous that<br />\nall of my friends who have seen<br />\nthe movie failed to find this<br />\n\"reverse racism.\" It is extremely difficult for me to believe that<br />\na person would have a problem<br />\nviewing a movie with a cast that<br />\nis all Black. I mean to say, I did<br />\nnot see even one Black person in<br />\n\"St. Elmo's Fire\" yet did not<br />\nhear anyone say that it was a<br />\nracist movie. The whole issue of<br />\n\"reverse racism\" is totally irrelevant when viewing this film.<br />\nThe third point that I would like<br />\n<br />\nI normally avoid the Hopkins<br />\nsport of Student Council-bashing<br />\nbecause I realize the power of the<br />\ngroup in any university is severely limited both by a lack of sufficient leverage within the administration and by the diversity<br />\nof opinions that such an organization necessarily has. To criticize<br />\na group in that position is unfair.<br />\nYet there seems to be a common goal of the Council that is<br />\nfeasible for them: the promotion<br />\nof parties (under the euphemism<br />\nof \"activities\") both on- and offcampus.

Apparantley, the News-Letter would<br />\nhave their readers believe that<br />\nMr. FitzGerald is nothing more.<br />\nthan an irresponsible loudmouth,<br />\nwhile nothing could be further<br />\nSee LETTERS, 9<br />\n<br />\nLife on the Force<br />\nPOLICE, from 7<br />\ncame upon a booth manned by<br />\ntwo eager-looking youngsters in<br />\nblue overcoats. \"Interested in<br />\nbecoming one of Baltimore's<br />\nfinest?\" inquired one of them.<br />\nThey were, as I later found out,<br />\nPolice Cadets, individuals between 18 and 21 who wish to be<br />\npolice officers but who are as of<br />\nyet too young. I filled out a form,<br />\nlisting my name, birthdate,<br />\neducation, and other vital sorts of<br />\ndata. I handed it to the young<br />\nwoman, who perused it, remarking that my college education<br />\nwould make me a very desirable<br />\ncandidate, and would guarantee<br />\nme a higher salary than an ordinary, mortal person would get.<br />\nShe said that I could either sit and<br />\nwait for them to call me, or if I<br />\nwere really anxious I could call<br />\nthem the next day.<br />\nMy inflated ego wouldn't allow<br />\nme to make the first move, as I<br />\nfigured that they would look at<br />\nmy application down at headquarters and trip over each other<br />\non the way to the telephone. But,<br />\nas is the case in life when one expects others to do things based on<br />\nhow one might perceive oneself,<br />\nnobody called. Due to a little<br />\nacademics and various other<br />\ndistractions, I didn't really think<br />\nabout the police for about a<br />\n\u2022 month.<br />\nIn the meantime, a bit of distur-<br />\n<br />\nbing news developed. A young<br />\nfemale police officer, out of the<br />\nAcademy only a few months, had<br />\nthe previous January calmly<br />\nwalked into the bedroom where<br />\nher boyfriend, who had been<br />\nabusing her extensively for a long<br />\nperiod of time, lay sleeping. She<br />\nproceeded to empty her service<br />\nrevolver into his sleeping body,<br />\nkilling him instantly and definitely. She was tried, found guilty,<br />\nand had just been sentenced to a<br />\nlong stay as a guest of the<br />\nMaryland Department of Corrections. What disturbed me were<br />\nreports that her intellignce testing<br />\nhad revealed an I.Q. in the low<br />\n80's. What kind of system is it,<br />\nI wondered, that would allow<br />\nsuch a candidate to get through<br />\nthe processing successfully?<br />\nAnyway, despite this news I<br />\ndecided in the middle of October<br />\nto phone him up. The moment<br />\nwas upon me. I would begin processing in earnest, and would<br />\nthen have a job waiting for me<br />\nwhen I graduated. I called, and<br />\ntalked to a gentleman who informed me that testing was daily<br />\nat 1:00 p.m., and that I should<br />\nreport, and this is a quote, \"as<br />\nsoon as possible!\" to police at<br />\n601 E.

Asked why he<br />\ncontinued to throw stones at the<br />\nsoldiers, the boy replied saying<br />\nthat his brother Muhammetl had<br />\ntold him to do so. The soldier,<br />\nfrustrated after having dodged<br />\nstones all day, ordered the boy to<br />\ntake him to Muharnmed. And so<br />\n<br />\nhe Obeyed and lead the Israeli<br />\nsoldier through the dirty and narrow streets of the camp till they<br />\nreached his one-room house. The<br />\nsoldier entered the home behind<br />\nthe little boy, who immediately<br />\npointed to the corner of his house.<br />\nThere, in the darkness of the<br />\nroom sat Muhammetl, a two year<br />\nold infant. The soldier left the<br />\nhouse in a sea of emotions.<br />\nSo what can we draw from this<br />\nstory? What does it symbolize<br />\nand so what? To the ordinary<br />\nreader the story may seem trivial<br />\nbut I urge you to see the simple<br />\ntruth that underlies it. For it<br />\nreflects the very nature of the current uprisings in the occupied territories. When you see a seven<br />\nyear old Palestinian throw a stone<br />\nat an Israeli soldier, do you ever<br />\nthink of why he does it or what<br />\ncauses him to do it? The real issue<br />\nhere concerns people, the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. They too, funny enough,<br />\nhave feelings, emotions, and concerns as we all do. They are fed<br />\nup of twenty years of Israeli occupation, of severe economic<br />\nrestrictions, of seeing their sons<br />\nbeaten and their husbands imprisoned. They struggle for a decent living and for their right to<br />\nself-determination to live as a<br />\ndignified people with basic<br />\nhuman and political rights. They<br />\nsearch for their identities in a<br />\nworld of poverty and refugee<br />\ncamps. And unfortunately their<br />\nonly possible means to express<br />\ntheir frustrations has been<br />\nthrough violence, nurtured by a<br />\n<br />\nhatred for the Israeli occupation.<br />\nBut why does this hatred exist?<br />\nThis is a question that I feel all<br />\nof us must ask ourselves,<br />\nespecially the Isrealis. Is a<br />\nPalestinian born with a gun in his<br />\nhand and an innate contempt for<br />\nIsraelis? What needs to be focused on are the root causes of the<br />\nproblem and not simply the<br />\nsymptoms that arise from it.<br />\nWhat people often tend to forget<br />\nwhen discussing the situation in<br />\nthe Middle East is the \"human<br />\nelement.\" It is a conflict between<br />\nvalues, beliefs, sentiments, and<br />\nabove all human souls. To fully<br />\nunderstand it you must enter the<br />\nminds and lives of the people involved and ask yourself \"why?\"<br />\nthis misery<br />\nWhat has caused<br />\nand bloodshed? This, I feel is of<br />\nthe essence.<br />\nPlease do not think that I oversimplify the problem. I am aware<br />\nof its complexity. My purpose<br />\nhere is not to offer a solution to<br />\nthe problem but rather an approach to be able to arrive at one.<br />\nI believe that the Israeli government should stop running away<br />\nfrom the reality that sits on its<br />\ndoorstep and as an occupying<br />\npower should help find a real<br />\nsolution to the Palestinian problem which is truly in its own interest. Accordingly, it should stop<br />\nusing brute force to suppress the<br />\nPalestinians knowing that it<br />\nbreeds only more bitterness and<br />\nresentment; and that it should<br />\nlisten with more care to what the<br />\ngrowing \"Peace Now\" movement in Israel has got to say. I say<br />\n<br />\nthis with a sense of urgency<br />\nbecause time is slowly running<br />\nout. Both sides of the conflict<br />\nhave suffered enough and if there<br />\nis ever a time for reconciliation,<br />\nit is now.<br />\nAnd in this day, the avenue to<br />\na \"peace process\" is somewhat<br />\non the horizon with talks of an international peace conference. My<br />\nhope is that all the parties concerned will meet together with<br />\nsome sense of understanding,<br />\ntolerance, and open-mindedness<br />\nrealizing that the fates of their nations lie intertwined. If this happens, a just and lasting peace<br />\n<br />\ncould possibly ensue.<br />\nIf not. \"Muhammed's\" little<br />\nvoice shall always continue to exist in the hearts of the Palestinians, pushing them on and on<br />\nand leading the Holy Land more<br />\nand more to its own doom.<br />\nFiras Raad<br />\n<br />\nVotem responsibly<br />\nnecessary to realize that Dick<br />\nGephardt scored zero percent on<br />\na free trade index for the 100th<br />\nCongress.

And,<br />\nmost importantly, vote when the<br />\ntime comes. Pat Roberston proved in Iowa that the silent mass<br />\nof voters who are usually<br />\napathetic can be mobilized and<br />\nutilized with comparatively little<br />\neffort. Robertson took second in<br />\nIowa largely because he convinced people who typically have a<br />\nvery low voter turnout that he<br />\ncould make a difference. And<br />\nthey made a difference for him.<br />\n<br />\nWe can't all work on a campaign staff. We can't even watch<br />\nthe news every day.

We have the<br />\nopportunity to lift ourselves<br />\nabove the temptation to retreat into our campus shells and pretend<br />\nwe aren't voting Americans. Certainly it may take a bit of work,<br />\nbut how many people have shed<br />\ntheir blood so that we have the<br />\nright to learn about the candidates?

Kaplan<br />\ndiscusses these subjects, in<br />\nhis own words, below.<br />\nThe Role of<br />\nStandardized Tests<br />\n\"I'd say it's quite important.<br />\nFirst of all, I think most law<br />\nschools will tell you that the<br />\nLSAT is a better predictor of<br />\nperformance in the first year<br />\nof law school than is the<br />\ngrade point average. These<br />\nare goal-directed tests. The<br />\nmedical school or the law<br />\nschool tells the test maker,<br />\n'these are the kinds of things<br />\nwe need. You design a test<br />\nthat tests these kinds of skills<br />\nand knowledge.' Obviously, if<br />\nyou do well in this test, which<br />\nis testing what you need in<br />\nlaw school or medical school<br />\nor business school, then you<br />\nshould do better in it.\"<br />\n\"However, I'm a firm<br />\n<br />\nbeliever that the grade point<br />\naverage is more important<br />\nthan the test score. There's<br />\nsomething wrong with comparing a 3 or 6 hour test with<br />\nthree or four years in school.<br />\nThe only balance of that is<br />\nthat so many grade point<br />\naverages vary. Some schools<br />\nhand out A's like party<br />\nfavors.. . sometimes<br />\njust<br />\nare<br />\nstudents<br />\nmemorizing.\"<br />\nThe Future of<br />\nAdmissions Tests<br />\n\"I have a self-interest in the<br />\nprocess, but there are many<br />\nthings wrong with the tests. If<br />\nthey just disappeared, I'd fold<br />\nup my tent and silently steal<br />\naway, but I don't think the<br />\ntests are going to disappear.<br />\nThe SAT's have become<br />\nmore and more important,<br />\nand for the other tests, I<br />\nbelieve that they will still be<br />\nimportant, but hopefully they<br />\nwon't be weighed as importantly. So far that isn't<br />\nhappening.\"<br />\nWhile Hopkins has not used<br />\nthe MCAT as an admissions<br />\ncriterion since September,<br />\n1986, Kaplan does not<br />\n<br />\nbelieve that abolition of the<br />\nMCAT is a trend that will<br />\nspread to other universities.<br />\n\"I haven't seen it. Usually<br />\nanother test is substituted for<br />\nit. Obviously, The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School is a<br />\nwonderful medical school,<br />\nand the kind of applicants<br />\nthey get are top students<br />\nanyhow, so / don't think the<br />\nare going to make<br />\n'much<br />\nmuch of a difference one way<br />\nor another.\"<br />\nHopes For The<br />\nFuture of Admissions<br />\n\"Hopefully, for medicine,<br />\nthere will be a more<br />\nhumanistic attitude because<br />\nmost students consider it in<br />\nterms of practicality. If they're<br />\ngoing to medical school, and<br />\nin medical school know they'll<br />\nneed biochemistry and<br />\nhistology, they'll take these<br />\ncourses as undergraduates,<br />\nand eschew psychology,<br />\nsociology, and music. I think<br />\nthat's a big loss to them.<br />\nHopefully students will be<br />\nlooking at medicine not just<br />\nfor the bucks they're going to<br />\nearn, but for the contribution<br />\nthey can give . .<br />\n<br />\nprovoking things,\" with people<br />\nwondering whether or not to<br />\nguess, \"rather than worrying<br />\nabout the test itself.\" In recent<br />\nyears, the GRE and LSAT have<br />\nabolished their penalties for<br />\nguessing, possibly for the reason<br />\n, Kaplan states, \"and the validity<br />\nis still there,\" he says.<br />\nThe cost for all of this preparation is not cheap. Tuition for<br />\nKaplan courses range from $495<br />\nfor the GRE, $545 for the<br />\nMCAT, to $595 for the LSAT<br />\nand GMAT. However, according<br />\nto Kaplan, \"we've never turned<br />\ndown a student because of inability to pay.\" Of the over 120,000<br />\nstudents in all Kaplan courses,<br />\napproximately 10 percent have<br />\nfinancial aid.<br />\nFew believe that Stanley<br />\nKaplan truly exists. \"People<br />\nthink I'm just a name like Betty<br />\nCrocker or Sara Lee,\" he says.<br />\n\"But seriously,\" he adds, \"who<br />\n<br />\nA Bell<br />\n<br />\nAlthough he doesn't teach<br />\nanymore, Kaplan still gets a thrill<br />\n\"when a student is floundering. . .and suddenly sees the<br />\nlight. I want to sing out 'She's got<br />\nit! She's got it!,' like Rex Hari rison in My Fair Lady\"<br />\nAlthough his preparation<br />\nmethods have been vindicated by<br />\nthe Educational Testing Service,<br />\nthe Princeton, N.J. based company that writes and administers<br />\nmany of the high school and<br />\ngraduate tests, and by the Federal<br />\nTrade Commission, others are<br />\nuncomfortable with Kaplan's<br />\ncontroversial role in the<br />\nAmerican educational system,<br />\ncalling his courses, as consumer<br />\nadvocate Ralph Nader did in his<br />\n1979 testing study, \"legalized<br />\ncheating.\"<br />\n\"If it's. legalized cheating,\"<br />\nKaplan - responds, \"then<br />\n<br />\n\"Ifyou don't know what they're talking about,<br />\nguess on something.\"<br />\n\u2014Stanley H.

Sean Bramble<br />\n\"I've always wanted to go to<br />\nan afternoon matinee where just<br />\none person was watching the<br />\nmovie, and sit right next to the<br />\nperson. I've always wondered<br />\nwhat that person would think.\"<br />\nSo says John Waters, director,<br />\nwriter, actor, and comic. His<br />\nlatest film, Hairspray, opens today at the Senator; the place<br />\nwhere, according to Waters, he<br />\nused to go for children's birthday<br />\nparties. \"I used to go to parties<br />\nin those private screening booths<br />\nall the time,\" he says.<br />\nThe film itself is set in a more<br />\ninnocent age as well. Set in 1962,<br />\nthe year \"before everything<br />\nchanged; before Kennedy, before<br />\nVietnam,\" the film follows<br />\nyoung Tracy Turnblad as she attempts to become a dancer for the<br />\nCorny Collins Show. A silly<br />\nsatire of \"teen\" and \"message\"<br />\nmovies, it shows Tracy emerge<br />\nvictorious as she not only makes<br />\nthe show, but also helps integrate<br />\nthe once all-white cast.<br />\nThe segregationalist/integrationist themes were difinitely a<br />\ntouchy subject for Hollywood,<br />\n<br />\nadmits Waters. \"If it was a<br />\nHollywood picture, they would<br />\nhave left all that out. They would<br />\nhave simply had blacks on the<br />\nshow.\" But avoiding touchy subjects is not in Waters' demeanor.<br />\nHe argues, \"How can you not<br />\nhave it (this idea) in the film? It<br />\nwas part of the time.\"<br />\nWaters' other movies have<br />\nbeen just as controversial as well.<br />\nHis first feature was Mondo<br />\nTrasho (1969), completed on a<br />\nbudget of $2100. The film<br />\nfollows the hideous turn of events<br />\nthat plague a single day in the<br />\nlives of a hit-and-run driver and<br />\nher victim. \"Those who laugh,\"<br />\nsaid the Baltimore Sun of its<br />\npotential audience \"are in more<br />\ntrouble than they know.\"<br />\nMultiple Maniacs (1970), the<br />\nstory of circus freak show hosts<br />\nwho lure unsuspecting suburbanites into their tents where they<br />\nrob and murder them, was<br />\nfollowed by Pink Flamingoev 1-1i<br />\nbest-known film, Flamingoes was<br />\nscreened at the Cannes Film<br />\nFestival and at the Paris<br />\nCinematheque, but it may have<br />\nkept Waters from selling his<br />\nidea for Hairspray much sooner.<br />\n<br />\n\"I pitched Hairpray to three<br />\nstudios: Geffen, Paramount, and<br />\nColumbia. The studio executives<br />\nwould be interested, then they'd<br />\nwatch Pink Flamingoes at ten in<br />\nthe morning with their wives.\"<br />\nThe film is the story of two<br />\nfamilies competing for the title of<br />\n\"The Filthiest People Alive.\"<br />\nSomehow, Walters laughs, \"it<br />\nmade them reconsider accepting \u2022<br />\nmy idea,\"<br />\nHairspray has been Waters'<br />\nmost ambitious film to date.<br />\nWaters says \"it was a challenge<br />\nto make a PG movie.\" It has also<br />\nbeen his most expensive film,<br />\nwith a budget of just around<br />\n$2,000,000, $425,000 of which<br />\nwas spent on the music rights<br />\nalone. \"I know it was an expensive film,\" adds Waters, \"when<br />\nI saw one of the production<br />\nassistants on the set sporting a<br />\nparka.\"<br />\nCurrently, Waters is promoting<br />\nhis film. \"I'm on Letterman the<br />\n25th, then Divine and I do Good<br />\nMorning America, followed by<br />\nDebbie Harry the next day.\" He<br />\nis also slated to have Random<br />\nHouse publish his third book: a<br />\ncompilation of his scripts for Pink<br />\n<br />\nFlamingoes, its unmade sequel,<br />\nand Desperate Living (1977).<br />\nFinally, when the film's release<br />\nis further behind him, he plans to<br />\ngo back and do the comedy club<br />\ncircuit he has done for years.<br />\nStill, Waters can't help but look<br />\nback with satisfaction at<br />\nHairspray, particularly its latter<br />\nstages. \"They do test screenings<br />\nfor the film, making sure that the<br />\naudience is comprised of 10%<br />\n<br />\nwives, 10% blacks, and so on\u2014I<br />\nwanted to know if they'd inlcuded the necrophiliacs, too,\" jokes<br />\nWaters. \"Anyway,the film came<br />\nto part where they should really<br />\nlaugh hard, and the audience loved it!\"<br />\nWhat happened then?<br />\n\"My producer leaned over to<br />\nme,\" replies Waters, \"and asked<br />\nme, 'Are you having an<br />\norgasm?'\"<br />\n<br />\nHairspray:<br />\nA Kitch Masterpiece<br />\nSomething Wild in its appraisal of and best friend Penny manage to<br />\noutrageous Americana, save that get caught up in the local segregaThat dishy Divine, seen here in an early John Waters film Multible<br />\nThe trashman cometh\u2014John it's set in the Sixties, and Waters' tion wars when they befriend the<br />\nManiacs.

Amongst these bands<br />\nwere the Minutemen. One of the<br />\nfirst bands on the then fledgling<br />\nSST label, the Minutemen were<br />\nknown for the fact that most of<br />\ntheir songs clocked in under one<br />\nminute. But what they could pack<br />\ninto that minute was often more<br />\nthan what most people could put<br />\ninto a six-minute opus.<br />\nMinutemen songs were, if<br />\nnothing else, aware and intelligently written, which made<br />\nthem stand out in a field populated by angst ridden singers<br />\nwho could only manage to say<br />\nthat the world sucked, and were<br />\nreally stuck to come up with<br />\nanything beyond that. Musically,<br />\nthe Minutemen sounded like a<br />\njazz trio, each player with a<br />\ndistinct style, pounding out their<br />\nown thing around a loose but<br />\nwell-defined core.<br />\nThe Minutemen managed to<br />\nput out eleven albums and EPs in<br />\nsix years, and when they weren't<br />\nin the studio recording, they were<br />\non the road touring. The Minutemen were one of the most productive bands around, and each<br />\nnew release chronicled the progression of a band that was<br />\nmaturing into something that<br />\nwent well beyond its original<br />\nhardcore beginnings. Tragically,<br />\nhowever, lead singer and guitarist<br />\nD. Boon died in an auto accident<br />\n<br />\nin 1985. With that, it looked like<br />\nthe end of everything the Minutemen had built up.<br />\nEnter Ed Crawford, longtime<br />\nMinutemen fan and guitar player.<br />\nCrawford pestered bassist Mike<br />\nWatt until they decided to give<br />\nhim a go, and Firehose was born.<br />\nFirehose's first album, Ragin',<br />\nFull On, picked up where the<br />\nMinutemen left off and even surpassed that point. Crawford<br />\nbrought with him a different set<br />\nof influences, not the least of<br />\nwhich was a tendency toward the<br />\nroots-rock style of such bands as<br />\nREM, which translated out into<br />\nhis vocal stylings and a much<br />\nfuller, cleaner guitar style. Songs<br />\nlike \"The Candle and the Flame\"<br />\nalso demonstrated a softer, more<br />\nemotional side to the band than a<br />\ndeparture from the more \"angry<br />\nyoung man\" oriented songs of the<br />\nMinutemen. The fates were not<br />\nkind when this album was released, however, and it was overshadowed by the release of Double Nickels on the Dime, a tworecord set of Minutemen songs.<br />\nLong-standing readers of this column will remember, however,<br />\nthat I urged everyone within earshot to go out and buy it.<br />\nI will unequivocally make the<br />\nsame statement for the new<br />\nFirehose album, Irn. If you never<br />\nlisten to me again, if you never<br />\nhave before, listen now: go buy<br />\nthis album. If you have any appreciation of music. whatever<br />\nstyle, you will appreciate this<br />\nalbum.

(Sadly enough, I don't<br />\nknow the name of this piece since<br />\nI was sent a test pressing which<br />\ndidn't label the songs.)<br />\nAlong with all this we have the<br />\nusual scat-like vocal stylings over<br />\nthe most minimal cymbal and<br />\nguitar work; the usual breakneck<br />\nromps of drummer George<br />\nHurley and bassist Mike Watt;<br />\nthe always expressive voice of<br />\nCrawford as he sings, wails, cajoles, questions, and asserts; and,<br />\nmost of all, still some of the best<br />\nlyrics in the biz, little phrasings<br />\nthat'll stick in your head for days,<br />\nand maybe even make you think a<br />\nlittle bit.<br />\nOnce again, I recommend this<br />\nalbum to everyone.

Henry Holt and Co.,<br />\n$16.95, 190 pp.<br />\n<br />\nby Noam M.M. Neusner<br />\nDispatches is a quick read, but<br />\na disturbing one. Woods has collected the articles he wrote over<br />\na two year period for the Daily<br />\nopposition<br />\nDispatch, an<br />\nnewspaper in South Africa. In the<br />\nbook, Woods characterizes the<br />\nSouth African regime with such<br />\ncandor it is hard to disagree with<br />\nhim. Each piece is an attack on<br />\nthe system of apartheid\u2014a system<br />\nof such complexity that it limits<br />\n\u2022 the way people live, from the<br />\nlanguage they learn in school to<br />\nwhere they sit in a park.<br />\nThe book is introduced by<br />\nnovelist Alan Paton as a \"book<br />\nin praise of freedom and in<br />\ndefense of freedom.\" After<br />\nreading the book, one would have<br />\nto join in with Paton's praise. I<br />\nwould go as far as to say the book<br />\nshould be read in any political<br />\nscience class discussing freedom.<br />\nWoods gives one example where<br />\nlove of freedom is contrary to<br />\nlove.of nation, a situation which<br />\ndoes not exist in this country or<br />\nin any democracy. South Africa<br />\nis not a democracy, nor is it an<br />\nacceptable dictatorship.<br />\nIt is not hard to say that apartheid is immoral. It has not been<br />\nsaid enough, however, that apartheid is impractical. Apartheid<br />\nreeks of stupidity and ignorance,<br />\nignorance not only of a black<br />\nman's right to liberty, but also ignorance of his potential ability to<br />\nreact against the current government. Woods' book is replete<br />\nwith different accounts of apartheid's impracticality. The reader<br />\nmay find these accounts redundant, but judging from an<br />\nAmerican's knowledge of apartheid, the accounts are necessary.<br />\nWoods' anger with apartheid<br />\ngrows within the book. His early<br />\narticles are a little immature,<br />\noften making their points with a<br />\nfinal, get-the-last-word-in attitude. Later, however, Woods<br />\nwrites angrily, and the humor<br />\nwhich existed early in the book<br />\ndisappears. Virtually all the later<br />\narticles are direct attacks against<br />\n<br />\ngovernment figures, primarily<br />\nPolice Minister Kruger. One can<br />\nnot help but be amazed that in an<br />\nopen letter to P.W. Botha, Woods<br />\nanswers Botha's claims that<br />\n\"Peking and Moscow would rejoice if the government is toppled,\" with: \"Well, most of the<br />\npeople in this country will rejoice . . .\" Wherein Wood lists<br />\nnot only every major city in South<br />\nAfrica, but every major city in the<br />\nworld. Only an angry man could<br />\nhave written and published such<br />\na response.<br />\nPerhaps the greatest contribution of Woods' book is his unique<br />\nperspective. Much has been written about how apartheid affects<br />\nblacks, but Wood includes whites<br />\namong the witnesses against apartheid. Woods describes the<br />\nsadness of living in a country<br />\nwhere your friendship with blacks<br />\nis restricted by space. You can<br />\nnot go to the same bathroom as<br />\na black man, nor can you sit on<br />\nthe same park bench. Woods expresses this sadness in each of his<br />\narticles: sadness that not even the<br />\nChurch actively opposes apartheid. That is why, one suspects,<br />\nmany English-speaking South<br />\nAfricans are leaving the country.<br />\nSometimes Woods' accounts<br />\nare extremely powerful, as when<br />\nhe attacks the government's<br />\ndispleasure with the BBC's<br />\n\"World at War\" series, which,<br />\nin a certain episode, graphically<br />\ndepicted the Dachau concentration camp. In one of the most<br />\npowerful paragraphs of the book,<br />\nWood laments: \"Yes, it is unpatriotic to love the things in your<br />\ncountry that are wrong. When the<br />\nDachau death camp was built,<br />\nHitler's men put up a sign outside<br />\nit: MY COUNTRY, RIGHT OR<br />\nWRONG. Those are among the<br />\nmost evil words ever written.\"<br />\nIf the South African government's intransigence is so strong,<br />\none can not make the argument<br />\nthat it is a government willing to<br />\nmake reform. There is no force<br />\nfor reform in South Africa from<br />\nwithin the government, nor will<br />\nthere ever be one. The<br />\nAfrikaaner, as expressed by<br />\nWoods, needs no friends and bitterly hates enemies. It is a<br />\ngovernment oblivious to the<br />\nworld around it.<br />\nWoods' attack of apartheid is<br />\n<br />\ndigenous residents of the most<br />\nsuccussful country on the continent. While a great deal can be<br />\nmade of their imbecilic racism,<br />\ntheir ingenuity and pride cannot<br />\nbe ignored. The Afrikaaner cannot be characterized just as a<br />\nracist: that would be a mistake<br />\nwhich would be just as ignorant<br />\nas any Afrikaaner's bigotry.<br />\nWoods' obliviousness to the<br />\nvolatile element of black leadership and also his ignorance of<br />\nAfrikaaner belonging detracts<br />\nfrom his main argument.<br />\nNonetheless, his testimony<br />\nagainst the current government is<br />\noverwhelming. After reading<br />\nabout the arrests, deaths in detention, and lack of freedom in South<br />\nAfrica, one cannot help but insist<br />\nthat something be done there.<br />\nWoods fails, however, in<br />\nexemplary in its frankness, hav- prescribing any viable solution,<br />\ning reduced the concept of and it is this failure which symAfrikaaner nationalism to mere bolizes our own helplessness.

This idea saw its<br />\nmanifestation and in many ways<br />\ntermination in the life and works<br />\nof Oscar Wilde.<br />\nWilde reacted in a number of<br />\nways to the bourgois regime he<br />\nfound so ridiculous. Like the<br />\npunks, he wore clothing which<br />\ncontrasted with the established<br />\nnorms of the society, preferring<br />\nbright colors and carnations to the<br />\nformal grays and blacks of the<br />\n1890's.

While Wilde did produce<br />\npoetry, he was most reknowned<br />\nfor his conversational talents and<br />\nthese talents found their best expression in playwriting.

Indeed, Wilde described the play as a manifestation of<br />\nthe attitude that,\". . . we should<br />\ntreat all the trivial things of life<br />\nseriously, and all the serious<br />\nthings of life with sincere and<br />\nstudied triviality.\" On both sides<br />\nof the Atlantic, the audiences loved it and the play's 1895 London<br />\nproduction went on for 86<br />\nperformances.<br />\nThe productions were stopped<br />\nby the scandal which emerged<br />\nfrom Wilde's trial for sodomy,<br />\ninstigated in fact by Wilde's own<br />\nfather, the Marquis of<br />\nQueensbury. The aged Marquis<br />\naccused Wilde in a relatively<br />\nsmall incident of being a<br />\nhomosexual, which Wilde clearly was, and his son responded by<br />\nfiling a civil lawsuit on the<br />\ngrounds of libel.

The changes in the hospital<br />\nsystem during the turn of the century and<br />\nthe problems that ensued parallel contemporary problems inherent in modern health<br />\ncare, asserts Dr. Charles E.

The<br />\nhospitals were basically reserved for the<br />\nupper class who were able to afford the<br />\nbest and most advanced care that medicine<br />\ncould offer.

Beginning his fifth season as head<br />\ncoach of men's lacrosse at Hopkins, Zimmerman has<br />\nalready led the Blue Jays to three national titles. He<br />\nwants more, and he believes his 1988 squad is<br />\ncapable of accomplishing this goal.<br />\nWith fifteen returning lettermen, including three<br />\nAll-Americans and a group of talented newcomers,<br />\nZimmerman attempts to lead Hopkins to its 43rd national championship. But the Jays will have to replace<br />\nfour graduated seniors who figured in AllAmerican honors a year ago.<br />\nATTACK<br />\nOn offense the Blue Jays lost to graduation one<br />\nof the most prolific scoring combinations of their<br />\nhistory. Gone are Craig Bubier and Brian Wood, who<br />\ncombined for 192 goals and 109 assists in their four<br />\nyears at Hopkins. Their collaboration began when<br />\nthe two played together at St. Mary's High School<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nTo replace Bubier and Wood the Jays retain senior<br />\nco-captain Mike Morrill, a third team All-American<br />\nlast season. Mon-ill led the Jays in scoring in '87 with<br />\n31 goals and 16 assists, and will be starting for the<br />\nfourth consecutive year. He will be joined by juniors<br />\nJohn Ciccarone (in '87 9 goals, 10 assists) and Jeff<br />\nIhm (5 goals,6 assists). Ciccarone managed to score<br />\nin each of Hopkins' championship tournament wins<br />\na year ago.<br />\nSophomores Scott Man- and Jay Clarke should get<br />\nsignificant playing time this year. Last year Clarke<br />\nfound the net twice for Hopkins while Marr recorded four goals and five assists. This sophomore duo<br />\nwill be joined by a fine crop of freshmen to round<br />\nout the attack, including Steve McElroy (Edgewood,<br />\nMD), Michael Morrissey (Massapequa, NY), Matt<br />\nPanetta(Elmont, NY), and John Sheehan (Towson,<br />\nMD). Hopkins coaches are particularly high on<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshatt<br />\n<br />\nPanetta, who could turn out to be the next Mike Mor- on this year's squad are Bill Dwan (Yorktown, NY),<br />\nrill of the bunch. In 1985 Mon-ill stepped into the Jamie McNealy (Severna Park, MD), Tom Raley<br />\nBlue Jay starting line-up fresh out of high school and (Baltimore, MD), and Brian Voelker (Baltimore,<br />\nscored the winning goal in the opener against MD). Word has it that Dwan and Voelker are the<br />\nSyracuse. Unless a freshman has such a surprise in ringers among this bunch.<br />\nstore this year, however, Hopkins goal-production<br />\nGOAL<br />\nmight go down from 1987.<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nAt midfield the Jays suffer two major losses. Both<br />\nfirst team All-American Steve Mitchell and second<br />\nteam All-American Larry LeDoyen graduated last<br />\nMay. Mitchell was the first long-stick midfielder in<br />\ncollegiate lacrosse history to be named to the first<br />\nteam defense, while LeDoyen enjoyed a stellar season<br />\nregistering 19 goals and 15 assists. LeDoyen, who<br />\ntransferred from Virginia for the 1986 campaign,<br />\nhighlighted his 1987 season by sparking fourth<br />\nquarter rallies in games against Rutgers and North<br />\nCarolina.<br />\nTo help replace these two the Jays still have senior<br />\nco-captain Jack Crawford, who was forced to miss<br />\nthe entire 1987 season due to a knee injury. In addition, Joe Rzempoluch will return after having missed all of '87 as well. The Jays therefore retain two<br />\nstar midfielders not even available last year during<br />\nHopkins' championship drive. The return of Rzempoluch is particularly heartening since in 1986 he<br />\ndeveloped into one of the game's leading face-off men.<br />\nJunior Greg Gunning handled these duties for<br />\nHopkins last year, so the Blue Jays should have the<br />\nmost depth in the nation in this pivotal area.<br />\nAlso returning are juniors John Dressel, Brendan<br />\nKelly, John Wilkens, and Pat Russell. Dressel scored<br />\ntwelve times for the Jays in '87, while Kelly led all<br />\nreturning Jays in scoring with 15 goals and 10 assists.<br />\nIt was John Wilkens who got things going for<br />\nHopkins in last year's semi-final victory over<br />\nMaryland with a blistering score early in the first<br />\nquarter. The midfield is rounded out by sophomore<br />\nGreg Lilly (5 goals, I assist) and freshman Mark<br />\nDressel (Timonium, MD), Jim Harkin (Setauket,<br />\nNY), Seth Tierney (Wantaugh, NY)and Jay Wright<br />\n(Littleton, CO).<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nDefense is the area from which Hopkins has lost<br />\nno players from its 1987 championship squad. No<br />\nBubiers, Mitchells, LeDoyens, or Woods to replace<br />\nhere. Rather, the Jays return first team All-American<br />\nDave Pietramala, and juniors Steve Ciccarone, James<br />\nDeTommaso, and Greg Lilly. This is the combination that not only gained experience in 1987, but proved good enough to help furnish that forty-second<br />\nNCAA title. Joining perhaps the best starting defense<br />\nin the nation will be seniors Eric Shaw and Nils<br />\nYoungwall, juniors Chris Chirieleison and Chip<br />\nDates, and sophomore Dave Howland. The freshmen<br />\n<br />\nA funny thing happened to Hopkins on their way<br />\nto a lacrosse championship last year. They found<br />\nthemselves an All-World goalie. Just as Jays fans<br />\nwere getting used to the fact that Larry Quinn was<br />\ngone, never to return, super saves and everdependable play reappeared in front of the Hopkins<br />\nnet.<br />\nIt all started in the middle of last season when the<br />\nlistless Jays were 3-2 and apparently prepared to kiss<br />\n1987 goodbye in the game against North Carolina.<br />\nThe Blue Jays had just been upset 9-7 by Virginia<br />\nat Homewood, and had never won a game at<br />\nCarolina's Fetzer Field. On a whim, preparing for<br />\nthe future perhaps, Zimmerman decided to start<br />\nfreshman goaltender Quint Kessenich. The rookie<br />\nresponded with 21 saves in Hopins' 11-10 comefrom-behind victory. The following week at<br />\nHomewood, Kessenich would stop 19 shots against<br />\nArmy and eventually end the season with a .619 save<br />\npercentage. The Jays went 7-1 with the freshman in<br />\nthe net, beating North Carolina in the quarterfinals,<br />\nand downing undefeated Maryland and Cornell teams<br />\nfor the championship. Kessenich was awarded with<br />\na third team All-American spot.<br />\nThere is a postscript to this story, however\u2014a<br />\nslightly unfortunate one. Kessenich was suspended<br />\nalong with defenseman Dave Howland for the first<br />\ngame of the season. There seems to have been some<br />\nsort of altercation at the Northway Apartments.<br />\nDefenseman James DeTornmaso was also in on the<br />\naction, but will not miss a game. In Kessenich's place<br />\nfor the opener against Syracuse will be senior Jeff<br />\nKramer, who saw six shots of action all last season.<br />\nA win here without Kessenich could foreshadow an<br />\nundefeated season for the Jays.<br />\nCOACHES<br />\nFor the 1988 season, two new faces join the<br />\nHopkins coaching staff. A 1987 graduate of Hopkins,<br />\nthree-time first-team All-American Brian Wood will<br />\nwork as a scout for the Jays. John Haus, formerly<br />\nan assistant coach at Loyola High School, will help<br />\ncoach defense. Returning from last year's staff are<br />\ndefensive coach Jerry Pfeifer, offensive coordinator<br />\nJoe Devlin, and goalkeeper coaches Les Matthews<br />\nand Brian Holman.<br />\nFred Smith, who had been involved in Blue Jay<br />\nlacrosse for the past forty years, passed away this<br />\nsummer.

what<br />\nwas thought to be a rebuilding season. Yet, when<br />\nthe dust finally cleared, they found themselves once<br />\nagain NCAA champions. How then can the Jays fail<br />\nto bring home the title this year? This is the question that Hopkins' opponents will be asking<br />\nthemselves as the Jays shoot for their forty-third national championship.<br />\nCoach Zimmerman's team took some hard knocks<br />\nin 1987, losing games to Syracuse, Virginia, and<br />\nMaryland. Hopkins will again face these teams, plus<br />\nperennial power North Carolina, in '88 in a schedule<br />\nthat mimics that of a year ago; Hopkins plays the<br />\nsame ten teams this year as last.<br />\nFortunately for this season's Jays, most of the<br />\ntraditional lacrosse giants are to be met at home,<br />\nnotably Maryland, North Carolina, and Syracuse.<br />\nHowever, these teams are ranked second, third, and<br />\nfifth, respectively, by the U.S. Intercollegiate<br />\nLacrosse Association, and Hopkins must travel to<br />\nplay the sixth-ranked Virginia squad that upset the<br />\nJays at Homewood last year. Also, Hopkins must<br />\nface on the road the seventh-ranked Navy team and<br />\nthe twelfth-ranked Army team. The Blue Jays just<br />\nbarely got by both Army and Navy in 1987. In the<br />\nother four games on the schedule (against Rutgers,<br />\nWashington College, Princeton, and Towson State)<br />\nHopkins stands really no chance of losing.<br />\nHere is a look at the 1988 Blue Jay's schedule,<br />\nweek by week:<br />\n<br />\nSYRACUSE<br />\nSaturday, March 5<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 10-4<br />\nThe Division I semi-finals and championship game<br />\nare being held at Syracuse University's Carrier Dome<br />\nthis year, so the Orangemen are assuming if they can<br />\nmake it that far, the title may very well be theirs.<br />\nThey hope to start their march to the top in the season<br />\nopener tomorrow against the Jays.<br />\nThe past five seasons have seen the Syracuse-Johns<br />\nHopkins lacrosse rivalry develop into one of the most<br />\nheated in American sports. The Jays allowed<br />\nSyracuse a come-from-behind victory in the 1983<br />\nfinal, only to soundly defeat them in the same game<br />\na year later. In 1985 the tradition started of facing<br />\nSyracuse on the first day of the season, and Hopkins<br />\ncomplied with a victory. In the following season's<br />\nopener, Zimmerman suffered his first defeat at<br />\nHomewood Field as the Orangemen handed Hopkins<br />\nan 11-10 loss. Playing in sub-freezing temperatures,<br />\nthe Jays were edged out despite a fourth quarter barrage in which Craig Bubier's shot whizzed just above<br />\nthe crossbar with twenty seconds to play.

Hopkins<br />\nassistant coach Bill Tierney has moved on to<br />\nPrinceton to take over the head reins there. Maybe<br />\nhis knowledge of the Blue Jay system can prevent<br />\na few goals scored against his new team.<br />\nBut not too many.

Just when you think the Jays<br />\nand the Tar Heels have played the greatest game of<br />\nall time, their next match is even closer.<br />\nIn 1982 Carolina beat Hopkins 13-12 in overtime,<br />\nonly to lose to them the following year 14-13 in double overtime. In 1984 it was 4-3 Hopkins, followed<br />\nby a UNC 11-10 overtime victory in 1985. In '86<br />\nthe Jays routed the Heels in the regular season only<br />\nto blow a fourth quarter 9-6 lead in the semi-finals<br />\nand lose to Carolina 11-10 in overtime. Last year<br />\nthe Jays won for the first time ever at Chapel Hill,<br />\n11-10, and then hosting the Tar Heels in the quarterfinals beat them by the same score. Put simply,<br />\nwhenever Johns Hopkins and North Carolina take<br />\nthe field together, chances are the game will be decided by one goal, quite possibly in overtime.<br />\nThis year, however, just may be a year when<br />\nHopkins can win semi-comfortably. North Carolina<br />\nis ranked number three but was expected to win it<br />\nall last season, not finish fifth. Having lost seven<br />\nstarters to graduation, Coach Willie Scroggs' team<br />\nshould have to scratch and claw to reach a high playoff spot. Among the seven lost to graduation are included three defensive starters, most notably threetime first team All-American and 1986 National<br />\nPlayer-of-the-Year Tom Haus. Also gone are two<br />\nstarting attackmen, including two-time Heel leading<br />\nscorer Gary Seivold, hero of the 1986 championship<br />\ntournament. Carolina has also incurred losses at midfield, most glaring the graduation of first team AllAmerican Joey Seivold.<br />\nTo take the places of the departing stars North<br />\nCarolina has a lot of bodies but no big names. One<br />\narea furnishing a familiar face is goaltending: Barney<br />\nAburn is to start for the third straight season for<br />\nUNC. But Aburn slumped last year, and if he does<br />\nnot regain his 1986 form the Heels may prove no<br />\nmatch for teams like Hopkins. On April 9th, look<br />\nfor a replay of the '86 game as Hopkins puts in gear<br />\nits drive to the '88 championship.<br />\n<br />\nVirginia had a strange season in 1987. Having narrowly missed an NCAA championship in their overtime loss to Carolina a year before, the Cavaliers<br />\nallowed themselves an early-season defeat at the<br />\nhands of Brown. It was simply the biggest win in<br />\nBrown's history. A few weeks later, coming into<br />\nHomewood with a 4-2 record, the Cavs upset the Prediction: Hopkins 14, North Carolina 8<br />\nJays and lifted their ranking to number six in the nation. They then proceeded to lose their next four<br />\ngames and remove their chances for even a top-12<br />\nSaturday, April 16<br />\nseed and a playoff-berth.<br />\nyear,<br />\nThe problem for other NCAA teams this<br />\nWest Point, NY<br />\nhowever, is that during Virginia's demise and injury- 7:00 p.m.<br />\nridden season of '87, they deveopled a nucleus of<br />\ntalented underclassmen to step in and keep the Cavs Series Record: Jays lead 43-13<br />\nrespectable. This raw-talented nucleus in now experienced and liable to bring UVA all the way to<br />\nSyracuse and the final-four this Memorial Day<br />\nweekend.<br />\nA year ago, for example, first-team All-American<br />\nCav goaltender Peter Sheehan came down with<br />\nmononucleosis. He was replaced by freshman Stew<br />\nRidgely, who responded with a .613 save percentage and 16 stops in the win over Hopkins. Another<br />\nthen-freshman, midfielder Andy Kraus, won 42 of<br />\nhis first 64 face-offs. In addition, Virginia will field<br />\nthree seniors in 1988 who had the best seasons of<br />\ntheir careers in '87. Bob Schulper led the inner<br />\ndefense in ground balls while attackmen Chase<br />\nMonroe and Doug Amacher developed into one of<br />\nthe top scoring combos in the country.<br />\nSo it is clear that the Cavaliers have talent. They<br />\nhave been duly ranked sixth in the pre-season poll.<br />\nBut can they convert their talent into a victory over<br />\nHopkins? Such a result is possible, but the Jays have<br />\nbeen known for some good players of their own, so<br />\nthat when the shooting is over at Charlottesville, look<br />\nfor another hard-fought Hopkins victory.<br />\n<br />\nARMY<br />\n<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 10, Virginia 6.<br />\n<br />\nArmy's bag is mixed concerning players returning from their seventh-ranked 1987 team. At attack<br />\nthe Cadets lose high scorers Doug Shaver and Joe<br />\nGillis, but retain Rob Betchley, who scored three<br />\ntimes in Army's 11-9 defeat last year at Homewood.<br />\nBetchley will be looking for feeds in front of the net<br />\nby a midfield squad entirely intact from a year ago.<br />\nAt defense Army loses two standouts from last<br />\nseason, Dan Williams and Tom Hickman, but the<br />\nCadets feel that in goalie Joel Portuese they possess<br />\nthe best netminder in the nation.<br />\nLast year at Homewood the Jays trailed Army for<br />\nmore than a half only to reverse a fourth-quarter<br />\ndeficit and beat the Cadets 11-9. This was the game<br />\nwhere freshman Quint Kessenich started for the first<br />\ntime at home and cemented the number one goaltending job by stopping nineteen Army shots. This year<br />\nthe Jays must travel up to West Point and meet the<br />\nCadets at Michie Stadium. It was here where Army<br />\nwas eliminated from the 1987 championship tournament by lesser ranked Adelphi, 6-5. As a result,<br />\nArmy has come into the 1988 season ranked twelfth.<br />\nBut don't let this relatively low ranking fool you\u2014<br />\nthe Cadets have talent. Of course, so do the Jays\u2014<br />\nenough to forebode another Hopkins victory.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 8, Army 6.<br />\n<br />\nMARYLAND<br />\nSaturday, April 23<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 45-30-1<br />\nGeographically closest to Baltimore among the<br />\nJays' top rivals, Maryland likes to bring up lots of<br />\nfans from College Park when they play Hopkins. Add<br />\nthis to the fact that April 23rd is Homecoming at<br />\nJHU, and Homewood Field should really be packed for this battle between the two top-ranked teams<br />\ncoming into the 1988 season.<br />\nUnfortunately for Hopkins, Maryland's roster also.<br />\nlooks packed\u2014with talent. A bevy of seniors return<br />\nfrom the 1987 squad that lost to the Jays in the semifinals 13-8. This is particularly true at midfield. Gone<br />\nto graduation is four-year standout Brian Willard,<br />\nbut the Terrapins retain All-American senior Tom<br />\nWorstell. Add to him Guy Riccardi, Chris Sullen,<br />\nand Tom Bedard, and Maryland possesses the most<br />\nexperienced midfield squad in the country.<br />\nAt attack, the Terps suffered some heavy losses,<br />\nlosing to graduation two out of three from their<br />\nawesome '87 offense, Mike Mosko and Kirk<br />\nThurston. But in senior Brendan Hanley they retain<br />\nperhaps the best of the bunch. Hanley will be joined<br />\nby another senior capable of scoring goals, Mike<br />\nSee SCHEDULE,8<br />\n<br />\n\f8 / MARCH 4, 1988<br />\n<br />\nMaryland, Navy, Towson round out season<br />\nSCHEDULE, from 7<br />\nSmith. In the net, Maryland loses All-American Jim<br />\nBeardmore, who stopped 75% of all shots coming<br />\nat him before he faced the Hopkins guns in the semifinals a year ago. To replace him will be a senior<br />\nwith some experience, Dennis Sullivan, if sophomore<br />\nWillie Griffin does not get a chance.<br />\nOne area which could prove the deciding factor<br />\nin the game against Maryland is face-offs, where the<br />\nTerrapins lost Todd Ensor, a senior a year ago who<br />\nwon 16 of 21 face-offs in the Terps' regular season<br />\n11-7 victory at College Park. But this year the Jays<br />\nget their face-off specialist back, Joe Rzempoluch.<br />\nAdd this to the fact that the game will be played at<br />\nHomewood, and the Jays should eke out their narrowest victory of the campaign.<br />\n<br />\nan NCAA tournament record. At midfield, the Midshipmen enjoy almost as much experience as the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, employing three seniors including All-American Frank Snyder. Finally, the<br />\nstarting defense is filled with nothing but juniors and<br />\nseniors, led by team captain Jim Darcy.<br />\nLast year the Jays played listless lacrosse against<br />\nNavy at Homewood, nearly handing the Midshipmen<br />\n<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 10, Navy 9<br />\n<br />\nTOWSON STATE<br />\nSaturday, May 7<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 12-0<br />\nCoach Carl Runk recently said the following about<br />\nhis Towson State Tigers lacrosse team, according<br />\nto the Towson State Sports Information Office: \"It's<br />\nhard to place a price tag on what we lost last year.<br />\nWe had a phenomenal bunch of seniors and the<br />\nleadership we received at each position on the field,<br />\nat practice, off the field, it was just overwhelming.\"<br />\nThis was a team Hopkins defeated 13-7 at Towson<br />\nlast year, so you can imagine just how well the Jays<br />\nshould do in '88 at Homewood. Gone are Tiger stars<br />\nJeff Peek, Richard Winkoff, and Jeff Dumpson. In<br />\n'87 the Tiger attack recorded 97 goals and 82 assists,<br />\nbut their only returning attackrnan this season is<br />\nsophomore Pat Gress, who as a sub in '87 recorded<br />\nthree goals and five assists.<br />\nSo it is clear that the Tigers are hurting. They will<br />\nretain sophowe goalie Dave Linthicum, who<br />\nwrested the starting job away from senior Tom<br />\nManos in the middle of last season, but this will not<br />\nnearly be enough to beat a Jays team looking to gain<br />\nmomentum for the playoffs.<br />\n<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 11, Maryland 10<br />\n<br />\nNAVY<br />\nSaturday, April 30<br />\nAnnapolis, MD<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 33-25-1<br />\nDon't look now, but this could be Navy's best year<br />\nsince 1970 when the Mids last won an NCAA<br />\nlacrosse championship. Last year they enjoyed their<br />\nbest season since 1979, finishing sixth in the country. This year Navy returns five All-Americans and<br />\neight of their top ten scorers.<br />\nIn goal the Midshipmen retain Joe Donnelly,a<br />\nsenior who played well in Navy's come-from-behind<br />\n10-9 defeat last year at Hopkins. On attack, Navy<br />\nleading scorer Paul Basile returns, a junior AllAmerican who recorded 8 assists in the Mids' 1987<br />\n14-6 play-off victory over Brown. The 8 assists are<br />\n<br />\na come-from-behind fourth quarter victory. This year<br />\nthe Mids are better, and so are the Jays, but the game<br />\nis being held at the Naval Academy.

Yet, in the<br />\nforthcoming three months they will be heavily<br />\nchallenged by the likes of North Carolina, Maryland,<br />\nCornell and Syracuse. Without any further introduction, here are our picks, along with our expert<br />\nanalyses.<br />\n1. Johns Hopkins Blue Jays: Led by returning<br />\nstarters, such as attackman Mike Morrill (last year's<br />\nleading scorer), midfielder Brendan Kelly,<br />\ndefensemen Dave Pietramala, James De Tommaso,<br />\nand Greg Lilly, as well as goaltender Quint<br />\nKessinich, this team has an excellent opportunity to<br />\nrepeat championship performance. Leadership will<br />\nbe provided by seniors Eric Shaw and John Dressel,<br />\nas well as the starters. The team will be anchored<br />\nby a solid defense, led by All-Americans Pietramala<br />\nand Kessinich. Along with Morrill, the scoring load<br />\nwill be carried by John Ciccarone, Jeff Ihm, Scott<br />\nMarr and John Wilkins. At midfield veterans Pat<br />\nRussell, Greg Gunning, and Greg Kelly should prove<br />\nreliable. The best coaching staff in the nation will<br />\nalso look to a promising class of freshmen for additional support. Although the losses of Brian Wood,<br />\nCraig Bubier, Steve Mitchell, Larry LeDoyen and<br />\nBruce Chanenchuk are worthy of mention, this onehundred and fifth edition of the Blue Jays are our<br />\npicks to win their 43rd national championship.<br />\n<br />\n3. North Carolina Tar Heels: A team, which on<br />\npaper seems to be as athletically talented as Maryland, the Tar Heels will need to replace seven starters<br />\nfrom a year ago. This includes their entire starting defense, which was led by first team AllAmerican Tom Haus, as well as third team member<br />\nChris Walker. At least early in the season, this should<br />\nloom as a stumbling block. On the offensive front,<br />\nthe Heels are minus their two scoring leaders in the<br />\nSeivold brothers. However, the team will be very<br />\nstrong on attack with returning players with starting<br />\nexperience Chris Hein, Chris Galgano, Corey Gavitt,<br />\nJohn Szczypinski, and Mark Tununillo. Led by the<br />\nplay and leadership of the Welsh brothers, Brett<br />\nDavy and Ted Brown, the midfield positions will be<br />\nwell stocked. Also, the starting goalie Barney Aburn<br />\nreturns for another season in Chapel Hill. As Coach<br />\nZimmerman commented, \"They are loaded offensively . . .they will be another very good team.\"<br />\n4. Syracuse Orangemen: The Orangemen will<br />\nhave a large gap to fill with the loss at graduation<br />\nof two starting attackmen, as well as All-World midfielder Todd Curry. The scoring slack will be picked up by attaclunan John Zulberti, as well as the<br />\nCanadian Gait brothers at midfield, of whom Gary<br />\nGait is expected to be named All-American as a<br />\nsophomore. Defensively, they lost some starters, but<br />\ncapable replacements are ready to accept their roles<br />\nof responsibility. In goal will be Matt Palumb, who<br />\nsat out the end of last season with a knee injury, but<br />\nas a sophomore will be expected to perform at a high<br />\nlevel.<br />\n<br />\nttunow<br />\nt00%<br />\nktt,k,o<br />\n<br />\n2. Maryland Terrapins: All-Americans Brendal<br />\nHanley (a transfer from Hopkins) at attack and Tom<br />\nWorstell at midfield lead this year's squad. Gone are<br />\nHopkins killers Jim Beardmore, Kirk Thurston and<br />\nMike Mosko, but this year's team seems to be one<br />\nof the most athletically gifted in the country. Replacing the highly regarded Beardmore in goal will be<br />\nsenior Dennis Sullivan. The entire defensive crew<br />\nreturns, minus Brian Jackson, so scoring on the Terps<br />\nshould be a formidable task. Phil Williard and Guy<br />\nRicciardi return as valuable midfielders. Of interest<br />\ncould be the play of the transfer student Pat Gugerty at this position as well. Senior Mike Smith, as well<br />\nas Hanley will lead the Terps attack. Coach Zimmerman remarked about the 1988 Terps: \"They are<br />\na very talented team...looks again this year to be<br />\na contender.\"<br />\n<br />\nUSIA* Divis<br />\nPreseason Poll<br />\nRanking<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nPOirtiS<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins (9)<br />\nMaryland (7)<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nCornell (1)<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nVirginia<br />\n<br />\n190<br />\n<br />\n175<br />\n152<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of Syracuse University<br />\n<br />\n5. Cornell Big Red: Led by Player of the Year<br />\nTim Goldstein, the Big Red will look to repeat as<br />\nparticipants in this year's NCAA championship<br />\ngame. Along with Goldstein on attack will be senior<br />\nJohn Wurzburger and junior Steve \"the Stork\"<br />\nMeyer. This could be the highest scoring frontline<br />\nin college lacrosse. Some of their key midfielders,<br />\nin first and second team All-Americans Bob Cummings and Todd Francis respectively, from last year's<br />\nIvy champ team, have graduated, but capable players<br />\nawait. On defense, their fine trio of Tim Vivian,<br />\nAaron Jones and Steve Paletta departed in June, but<br />\ntheir goaltender, Paul Schimoler, returns in quest of<br />\nanother final four appearance. As Zimmerman stated,<br />\n\"They should once again be tough in '88.\"<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nthis point in the season, they will face tremendous<br />\ncompetition from other top-ranked teams, including<br />\nMaryland, Virginia, and Hopkins. Look for Navy<br />\nto have an uplifting early spring, and possibly, a long<br />\nrun in the NCAA's.<br />\n7. University of Massachusetts Minutemen: Led<br />\nby first team All-American Tom Carmean, the<br />\nMinutemen will look to establish themselves as contenders for the NCAA championship. Although many<br />\nlacrosse fans are unimpressed with most teams away<br />\nfrom the mid-Atlantic and New York regions, many<br />\nin Amherst believe this squad will be heard from in<br />\nthe spring. Besides Carmean, U Mass will rely on<br />\nthe exploits of goaltender Sal LoCascio, last year's<br />\nthird team All-American. Sources close to High<br />\nSchool Lacrosse have said that U Mass captured the<br />\nbest young attackmen from Long Island last year.<br />\nAlthough their schedule can't compare with those<br />\nof the traditional powers, the Minutemen should still<br />\nbe regarded as one of the top teams going into this<br />\nyear's season.<br />\n8. University of Virginia Cavaliers: Although at<br />\nthis point, coach Jim Adams picks his squad no<br />\nhigher than sixteenth, the Cavaliers will look to return<br />\nto the competitive level that marked their program<br />\nin the past. Even with last year's disappointment,<br />\nthere were signs that this was indeed a top flight program. Such was the case when Virginia invaded<br />\nHomewood and defeated the Jays last year. However,<br />\non the downside there was the shocker suffered at<br />\nthe hands of the Brown Bruins. Their only AllAmerican selection, defenseman Scott Lind, has<br />\ngraduated, so leadership will become a key for this<br />\nteam.

The 11-10 victory over<br />\nCornell University in the final game marked the third<br />\ntime in four years that the Blue Jays under Coach<br />\nZimmerman have captured the title.<br />\nThe season started on an unhappy note when<br />\nHopkins lost an early March game in the Carrier<br />\nDome to Syracuse University, 15-14, The following week, the Jays travelled to Rutgers where senior<br />\nmidfielder Larry LeDoyen sparked the Blue Jays in<br />\nthe fourth quarter to help seal a 10-7 win.<br />\nPlaying at Homewood for the next two Saturdays,<br />\nHopkins completely dominated Washington College<br />\n23-7, and Princeton University 21-6. At this point<br />\nmany felt that the 1987 Jays had finally hit their<br />\nstride. But the next Saturday, Virginia invaded<br />\nHomewood and pulled a surprise upset over the Jays<br />\nby the score of 9-7. This was the poorest performance<br />\nby a Hopkim team in the last four years and skeptics began to question the destiny of the '87 squad.<br />\nTo say the Jays had their backs against the wall<br />\nis an understatement. On the following Saturday,<br />\nHopkins had to travel to Chapel Hill to face the defending national champion Tar Heels of the University<br />\nof North Carolina. And to make matters even worse,<br />\nHopkins had never defeated Carolina on their home<br />\nturf.<br />\nTo shake things up quite a bit, Coach Zimmerman decided to start freshman goalkeeper Quint<br />\nKessenich against North Carolina. Many felt that this<br />\nwas throwing the lamb to the wolves\u2014starting a<br />\nfreshman against the defending national champion.<br />\nBut Kessenich had shown flashes of brilliance during practice and the coaching staff was confident of<br />\nhis abilities.<br />\nThe game turned out to be a thriller. Tied at the<br />\nhalf, Carolina jumped to a two goal lead late in the<br />\nthird period. Things looked bad for the Jays until<br />\nLarry LeDoyen took control. Displaying the talent<br />\nthat many knew he had, Larry led the Jays to a comefrom-behind 11-10 victory. Kessenich proved he was<br />\na future star by making 21 saves in the nets.<br />\nThe following Saturday a tough 11-9 victory over<br />\n<br />\nArmy set up the big game\u2014Hopkins versus<br />\nundefeated and top-ranked University of Maryland<br />\nat College Park. Before more than 20,000 fans,<br />\nHopkins stayed with the Terps for three quarters,<br />\nwhich no other team in the country had managed to<br />\ndo. But in the deciding fourth period. Maryland<br />\noutscored the Jays 4-0 to take an 11-7 victory. It was<br />\na tough loss for the Jays, but hopes were high that<br />\nthese two squads might meet again in the playoffs.<br />\nHopkins returned to Baltimore with an umimpressive 10-9 Homecoming win over Navy. The<br />\nMidshipmen had roared back to almost tie the score<br />\nlate in the fourth period.<br />\nWith a 6 and 3 record, the Blue Jays were scheduled to close the regular season on the following Saturday night against a hungry Towson State squad at<br />\nTiger Stadium. Many felt that this would be the year<br />\nfor Towson to beat Johns Hopkins for the first time,<br />\nbut Hopkins, playing the most consistent lacrosse of<br />\nthe season, handed Towson a convincing defeat. It<br />\nappeared that perhpas the Blue Jays were finally hitting their peak going into the all-important playoffs.<br />\nRanked fourth in the twelve team tournament,<br />\nHopkins hosted fifth-ranked North Carolina in a<br />\nrematch that would determine who would go to the<br />\nFinal Four at Rutgers University. Following the usual<br />\nscenario when these two teams meet, the contest was<br />\nhard fought all the way. Late in the game Carolina<br />\ntook a one goal lead after being down by two. after<br />\nsophomore middie Brendan Kelly tied the score with<br />\n2:30 to play, the defense cleared the ball to Mike Morrill, who scored his sixth goal of the game to give<br />\nHopkins the lead and an 11-10 win. This was perhaps<br />\nMorrill's finest day as a Blue Jay. Kessenich was<br />\nagain tough in the goal, coming up with 23 saves,<br />\nseveral at point-blank range.<br />\nThe win over North Carolina gave Hopkins<br />\nmomentum going into the Final Four, something they<br />\nwould surely need because they would be facing stillundefeated Maryland in the semi-finals. It had been<br />\nsaid that the 1987 Terp team might be the best ever<br />\nfielded at Maryland, and Coach Zimmerman and his<br />\nstaff knew that it would take an almost-perfect game<br />\nto upset the number one ranked Terrapins.

/>\nroughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, and the use of<br />\nan illegal crosse. Watch for these to see just what<br />\nthey are. There is a lot of subjectivity in the calling<br />\nof these fouls\u2014it depends mostly on the mood of the<br />\nreferees. The penalty for a personal foul is suspension from the game for one to three minutes, depending on the severity of the foul. The offender's team<br />\nplays short-handed during the penalty.<br />\n*Expulsion fouls: A player will be suspended for<br />\nthe remainder of the game for really nasty attempts<br />\nto injure or for committing five personal fouls.<br />\nHowever, the penalized team is allowed to substitute<br />\nfor the expelled player.<br />\n*Technical fouls: These are less serious fouls and<br />\nother rules violations. These include interference,<br />\nillegal screening, holding, pushing, touching the ball<br />\nwith the hands, withholding the ball from play,<br />\nthrowing the crosse, illegal procedure (a very broad<br />\ncategory, indeed), stalling, illegal equipment, and<br />\ncrease violations. The penalty for a technical foul<br />\nis either a 30-second penalty (if the offending team<br />\ndoes not have possession of the ball at the time the<br />\nfoul is committed) or simply loss of possession of<br />\nthe ball (if the offending team does have possession.)<br />\n*Penalty enforcement: A penalized player will<br />\nremain off the field (and his team plays one man<br />\ndown)for the duration of the penalty time unless the<br />\nother team scores a goal or the penalized team gains<br />\npossession of the ball in its attack goal area.<br />\n*Out of bounds: When the ball is thrown out of<br />\nbounds by one team, possession is awarded to the<br />\nother team, unless the ball was deemed a shot-ongoal that went out-of-bounds. In this case, possession is awarded to the team, one of whose in-bounds<br />\nplayers was closest to the ball when it crossed the<br />\nboundary line.<br />\n*Crease Privileges:No opposing player is allowed<br />\nin the goal crease area at any time. They may reach<br />\ninto the crease with their sticks to play a loose ball,<br />\nas long as they don't make contact with the goalie<br />\nor his stick. Furthermore, a defending player, including the goalkeeper, with the ball in his possession, may not enter the goal-crease area. Nor may<br />\nhe remain in the goal-crease area in possession of<br />\nthe ball longer than four seconds.<br />\n*Time-outs: Each team is allowed to call two<br />\ntimeouts per half and one per each sudden-death<br />\nperiod. Timeouts can be called when the ball is dead<br />\nby either team or by the team with the possession<br />\nof the ball in the attacking half of the field. The coach<br />\nor the captain of the team can call a timeout.<br />\nWel!, there you have some of the basic rules of<br />\nthe game of lacrosse. Some of them may seem sort<br />\nof strange to those of you who are new to the sport,<br />\nbut after you see a few games, you'll get the hang<br />\nof it and even start second guessing the refs (who<br />\nare almost never right, anyway).<br />\n<br />\nby Glen Weiss<br />\nAlthough it may at first look like a totally foreign<br />\nsport to those of you who are used to baseball, football, basketball, and hockey, lacrosse is a fairly simple game that, armed with the knowledge of a few<br />\nbasic rules, anyone can understand and enjoy. If<br />\nyou've never actually seen a lacrosse game, there<br />\nare a few rules that should become readily apparent<br />\nto you tomorrow at Homewood field; on the other<br />\nhand, there are also a few rules which might baffle<br />\nyou.<br />\nFirst the easy stuff:<br />\n*Each team consists of ten players on the field at<br />\nany one time, barring penalties, of course. These<br />\nplayers are trying to score goals by carrying, throwing or batting the ball with the crosse (stick) in an<br />\nattempt to put the ball into the opponent's net.<br />\n*The ten players are arranged in different position on the field: three attackrnen, who play almost<br />\nexclusively in the attack half of the field; three<br />\ndefensemen, who play almost exclusively in the<br />\ndefensive half of the field, and one goalkeeper, who<br />\nplays almost exclusively in front of his net.<br />\n*The game is 60 official game-minutes in length,<br />\ndivided into four 15-minute quarters. There is a twominute time-out between the first and second periods<br />\nand the third and fourth periods, and a halftime of<br />\nat least ten minutes. In the event of a tie score at the<br />\nend of the fourth period, successive four-minute sudden death periods are played until a team scores.<br />\n*Play begins with a face-off at the center of the<br />\nfield. The two face-off men line up on opposite sides<br />\nof the center line, while the goalkeeper and three<br />\nother players are confined to the defensive goal area,<br />\nthree players are confined to the attack goal area,<br />\nand one player remains in each of the wing areas (see<br />\nfield diagram). When the whistle blows, the faceoff men battle for the ball, while the players in the<br />\nwing areas are released, but the other players must<br />\nremain in the goal areas until a player on either team<br />\nhas gained possession of the ball, the ball goes out<br />\nof bounds, or the ball crosses into the goal area.<br />\nNow for the less obvious rules:<br />\n\u2022Offsides: A team is considered offside when<br />\neither it has fewer than three men in its attack half<br />\nof the field or it has fewer than four men in its defensive half of the field. When one team is offside, a<br />\ntechnical penalty is called against that team (see<br />\nbelow).<br />\n*Legal player actions: \"Bodychecking\" of an opponent in possession of the ball or within five yards<br />\nof a loose ball, from the front or side above the knees<br />\nand below the neck, is legal. A player may check<br />\nhis opponent's crosse with his own crosse when the<br />\nopponent has control of the ball or is within five yards<br />\nof a loose ball or when the ball is in flight within<br />\nfive yards of the player.<br />\n*Personal fouls: These include illegal bodycheck-<br />\n<br />\nOfficial's Signals<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\nOFFSIDE<br />\n<br />\nNO SCORE<br />\n<br />\nSCORE<br />\n<br />\nTIMEOUT<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n\u2022,_<br />\nSLASHING<br />\n<br />\nTECHNICAL FOUL<br />\n<br />\nILLEGALLY TOUCHING THE BAL.<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nRaiff<br />\n<br />\nBRUSH OFT<br />\n<br />\nOUT OF BOUNDS DIRECTION OF PLAY<br />\n<br />\nSTALLING<br />\nIsee nolei<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nGET IT IN<br />\nKEEP IT IN<br />\n<br />\n1111GALIT IN CREASE<br />\nMOUSE INFRACTION<br />\n<br />\nDELAY Of GONE<br />\n<br />\nNote Fze stalling point SI player and then in chretbon hall should go<br />\n<br />\nIS<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\nPICK OFF<br />\n<br />\nHOLDING<br />\n<br />\n18<br />\nPUSHING<br />\n<br />\nBALI IN POSSESSION ON FICE4IFF<br />\n<br />\nThe Lacrosse Field of Play<br />\n<br />\nUNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS<br />\n<br />\nLINE<br />\n<br />\nSIDE<br />\nHO YDS<br />\n,00 58-<br />\n<br />\nWING<br />\n<br />\nAREA<br />\n2\" \u2022\u2014\u202221<br />\n<br />\n-\u2022<br />\n<br />\n15 YDS<br />\nI , 3 72'<br />\n<br />\n40<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n40<br />\n<br />\nYDS<br />\n<br />\nYDS<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nSODS<br />\nUNSPORTSMIALLKE CONDUCT<br />\nBLOCIoNG BELOW THE KNEES TRIPPING<br />\n<br />\n6'<br />\n<br />\n85-)<br />\n<br />\nGOAL<br />\nAREA<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\nvs<br />\nCI<br />\na- a<br />\n0\"<br />\n<br />\nRADIUS<br />\n<br />\n10 Y DS<br />\n<br />\n1 9 14,3<br />\n<br />\nWING<br />\nSPECIAL<br />\n<br />\nFROIA THE REAR<br />\n<br />\nGOAL<br />\nAREA<br />\n<br />\nSUBSTITUTION<br />\n<br />\n10 YDS<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n14,1<br />\n<br />\nAREA<br />\n<br />\n,-_-<br />\n<br />\nAREA<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\nCOACHES<br />\nl'(,yDs-....i<br />\n(5 44,1<br />\n5 YDS' AREA<br />\niI45N,.<br />\nTABLE AREA<br />\n1\u2014<br />\ne'llr<br />\n1::\"-----1<br />\n5YDS<br />\n.3 YDS<br />\n4<br />\ni<br />\nTIMERS TABL<br />\n1-/ \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014BENCH AREAS<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\nC OAARCEHAE<br />\n<br />\nSIDE LINE<br />\nI 6 y<br />\n<br />\nn<br />\nCROSSE CHELAING<br />\n<br />\n\f14 / MARCH 4, 1988<br />\n<br />\nSimmons interview reveals his hopes for Orange<br />\nRoy Simmons Jr., the head coach of the Syracuse<br />\nlacrosse team, spoke with Patrick Furey ofthe NewsLetter on February 26th. We thank Coach Simmons<br />\nfor his time and his help with our coverage of the<br />\nOrangemen.<br />\nN-L: Your success in the Carrier Dome in the past<br />\nhas been phenomenal. Do you feel this gives you an<br />\nadvantage going into this season, being that the<br />\nNCAA Final Four will be held at Syracuse?<br />\nSimmons: Well, I think we're probably called a<br />\nsynthetic surface team in that we play transition ball,<br />\nand if we're in a free game, that's the way we like<br />\nit. I think if anybody, like any armchair quarterbacks,<br />\nfound a problem with us, it was at Delaware and<br />\n<br />\nI think that if we have any<br />\nweaknesses, it's that we're going to give up some goals.<br />\nBrown, where we were forced to play on a dirt field<br />\nwhich slowed us down a bit and made the groundballs a little inconsistent. So, we obviously like playing here [at the Carrier Dome] because of the surface.<br />\nN-L: You've been extremely successful against<br />\nHopkins the past two years. To what do you attribute<br />\nthis success, and how do you see the game this year?<br />\n<br />\nwire. We played North Carolina in our opening<br />\nbasketball game this season, and they had a similar<br />\nsituation with J.R. Reid. All I think it did was make<br />\nSimmons: Last year we were not unlike Hopkins, the team reach down and get a little bit tougher, and<br />\nin that we both held sensational freshmen. We had they came forward and made up the difference. I<br />\nhoped not to use Matt Palumb just like Hopkins pro- think psychologically the Jays are strong enough to<br />\nbably hoped not to use Quint Kessenich.

Unfortunately, that's kind of been our<br />\nhallmark the last few years. We get a lot of goals,<br />\nand if we get enough we can win. In the semifinals<br />\nlast year, we scored 15 goals and lost. That kind of<br />\ngoal production should be enough to win you ball<br />\ngames. Last year we beat Hobart 20-15 in what was<br />\nreally a scoring duel and not a very defensive battle.

Being the host school is nice, but Coach Roy Simmons,<br />\nJr. would like nothing more than to be the host team<br />\nfor the Memorial Day weekend festivities.<br />\nSyracuse has been to the semifinals each of the past<br />\nfive seasons, the second longest run of success in<br />\nthe country behind Johns Hopkins. During that time<br />\nthe Orangemen have played in the championship<br />\ngame three times and won a national title. Would<br />\na sixth straight berth in the semis and the chance to<br />\nplay at home for the championship appeal to Simmons? Syracuse has an all-time Carrier Dome record<br />\nof 40 wins and 3 losses and has won 36 of its last<br />\n37 there. The Orangemen also have a 9-0 record at<br />\nhome in the NCAA playoffs, 8-0 in the Dome.<br />\nSyracuse is coming off of a somewhat disappointing 9-4 season. Such is the nature of Syracuse<br />\nlacrosse in the '80s, that a number 3 national ranking and a trip to the national semifinals could be<br />\ndisappointing. Expectations for the Orange are a split<br />\n(at least) in the early season games with Hopkins and<br />\nNorth Carolina and then a clean sweep through the<br />\nrest of the regular season.<br />\nLast season started out that way. The Orange opened the season at home by beating Hopkins 15-14 in<br />\nfront of a Carrier Dome crowd of 11,198. Hopkins<br />\nwould go on to win the national title. SU took to the<br />\nroad and dropped a 13-11 verdict to the defending<br />\nnational champions, the North Carolina Tar Heels.<br />\nThe clean sweep never materialized, however, as SU<br />\nbeat Cortland but stumbled to a 19-9 loss against<br />\nAdelphi.<br />\nFollowing grass field road wins over Army and<br />\nBrown (mud in the latter case), the Orangemen<br />\nreturned to the friendly confines of the Carrier Dome<br />\nfor a showdown with undefeated Cornell. The Big<br />\nRed, fielding its best team in a decade, blitzed SU<br />\n19-6 to end the Orangemen's 36 game home winning streak. At 4-3, and falling in the rankings,<br />\nSyracuse could have packed it in. Instead the Orange<br />\nput it all together and started plaiying its most inspired lacrosse of the season.<br />\nIt began with a 20-15 shelling of Division III champion Hobart, a win that gave SU the Krause-Simmons<br />\nTrophy. From there the Orange belted Rutgers 17-5,<br />\nheld off Penn 12-10 and stormed U Mass 17-11 to<br />\nfinish the regular season 8-3.<br />\nThe late season play of the Orange earned them<br />\nthe third seed in the NCAA playoffs and a bye in<br />\n<br />\nSimmons: on lax<br />\nSIMMONS, from 14<br />\ntunity. We weren't on a year to year basis with<br />\nHopkins until 1984, and we were fortunate that we<br />\nwere able to get on the schedule. I think this game<br />\nis important for lacrosse, and it's a pleasure for us<br />\nto come to the Hall of Fame. There's only four or<br />\nfive schools in the entire year that have that opportunity, and we have that opportunity and realize how<br />\nfortunate we are.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel there is parity in college lacrosse<br />\ntoday?<br />\nSimmons: No, not really. You have to go back<br />\nand look at the record and look at the 80's. Hopkins<br />\nand Syracuse are the only two teams that have been<br />\nfive straight years at the sight of the championships.<br />\nThe others have been Carolina, Virginia, and<br />\nMaryland. Every now and then you have someone<br />\nelse come on the scene, like now Cornell is sneaking back in. Lately, they've expanded the tournament to try to make it more alluring, but the strength<br />\nstill lies with seven or eight teams in the east. I think<br />\nthe sleepers this year will be U. Mass and Adelphi,<br />\nbut year in and year out the same perennial powers<br />\nsurface. We just hope that we can keep our heads<br />\nup and stay in the ball game. I like the fact that the<br />\nfinals are here (at Syracuse) and they'll never be at<br />\nHomewood, but it puts a lot of pressure on a lot of<br />\nyoung kids<br />\n<br />\nCourtesy of Syracuse University<br />\n<br />\nthe first round. In the second round, Syracuse hosted<br />\nNavy in the Dome. Regular season or playoffs, it<br />\ndidn't matter. The red-hot Orangemen trounced the<br />\nMiddies 19-5, earning a return trip to the NCAA<br />\nsemis and a rematch with Cornell in the process.<br />\nThe scene was a much different one from the two<br />\nteams' earlier meeting in the Dome. Syracuse hung<br />\ntough with the Big Red all day and actually had leads<br />\nof 6-4 and 11-10. After falling behind 15-12, the<br />\nOrange came back behind two Gary Gait goals to<br />\ntie it up. With the momentum apparently shifting to<br />\nSyracuse, Cornell coach Richie Moran called for a<br />\nstick check on Gait. The stick proved to be legal,<br />\nbut the stoppage in play seemed to take the steam<br />\nout of the Orange. Cornell scored three unanswered<br />\ngoals and the Syracuse season was over, 18-15. Cornell went on to lose the championship game to Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nKey losses from last year's SU squad include twotime first team All-American midfielder Todd Curry,<br />\nmidfielder Rhett Cavanaugh (third team AllAmerican), defenseman Dan Pratt (honorable mention All-American), goalie Jim Gyory (a 1986 AllAmerican), and attackmen Gordie Mapes and Tom<br />\nNelson, one of the leading scorers in SU history.<br />\nBut Simmons' cupboard is not bare. Not by a long<br />\nshot. Returning for SU are attackman John Zulberti<br />\n(second team All-American), the team's second<br />\nleading scorer last season with 24 goals and 22<br />\nassists, the twin duo of Paul and Gary Gait, who as<br />\nfreshman combined for 36 goals, and sophomore<br />\ngoalie Matt Palumb, who earned the starting job midway through last season only to go down<br />\nwith an injury.<br />\nWhat is the outlook for a return trip to the championships? Despite the loss of 14 seniors from last<br />\nyear's squad, Syracuse is a good bet to make a run<br />\nin the NCAA playoffs. The SU midfield is as big<br />\nand talented as any in the country and the defense<br />\nis improved over last season. The attack will be<br />\nyoung, but if Zulberti is healthy look for him to ring<br />\nup some big numbers. The net should be in good<br />\nhands with Palumb, who showed what he is capable<br />\nof in impressive wins over Army and Brown last<br />\nseason.<br />\nSU will have to make up for the loss of Todd Curry<br />\nand attackmen Nelson and Mapes. But the '87<br />\nOrangemen had to overcome the loss of Orange goalking Tom Korrie and the '86 Orange had to compensate for the loss of all-time NCAA scoring leader<br />\nTim Nelson. Invariably, great programs have to<br />\nreplace great players. 1988 will not be any different.<br />\nHere is a look at the 1988 Orangemen:<br />\n<br />\nAttack<br />\nThe name to remember on attack is John Zulberti. Zulberti had a blood clot in his arm last year in<br />\nthe pre-season, which hampered him in the early<br />\ngames. He finished strong and should be ready for<br />\nhis best season yet. Zulberti scored 24 goals and 22<br />\nassists last year and already has 57 goals and 63<br />\nassists for his career. Simmons says that Zulberti is<br />\n\"disruptive\" to a defense and cannot be contained<br />\none-on-one. Probable starters along side Zulberti are<br />\nsophomores Greg Burns (9-4-13) and Jim Egan<br />\n(5-1-6), who proved as freshmen they were capable<br />\nof making the big play.<br />\nMidfield<br />\nWith Rutgers transfer Brad Roos joining the Gait<br />\ntwins, SU has a formidable midfield. All three are<br />\nin the area of 6-2, 195 and all have good speed. Roos<br />\nearned All-American honors as a junior with the<br />\nScarlet Knights. Gary Gait was an honorable mention All-American last year, as well as a member of<br />\nthe NCAA All-Tournament team. The Gaits combined for 36 goals last year as freshmen, with Gary<br />\nscoring 25 and Paul 11. The leading candidate for<br />\nfaceoff duty is senior co-captain Bill Dirrigl, although<br />\nCoach Simmons will give Kirk Pratt and others a<br />\nlook.<br />\nThe second midfield will likely include senior<br />\nKeith Owens, junior Peter Allen and JamesvilleDewitt High School All-American Rick Cramner,<br />\nwhich will give Simmons the balance of upper and<br />\nlower classmen he likes to see on his lines.<br />\nThe defensive midfield will be led by juniors Steve<br />\nScaramuzzino and Phil Schluter and sophomores<br />\nDavid Patane and Rob Persing, who will carry the<br />\nshort stick.

Being limited to just one offensive midfield, Hopkins knew that the game had<br />\nto be slowed down to allow its players to rest. To<br />\nhelp in this plan, Coach Zimmerman employed a Jay<br />\nTeam, six reserves who went in as a complete unit<br />\nto spell the regulars on offense.<br />\nIt was \"all Hopkins\" from there, as Brian Wood<br />\nshowed the form that made him the great player he<br />\nwas. Brian exploded for five goals that day and<br />\nplayed the game of his career. In the end, it was<br />\nHopkins over Maryland to set up a date with Cornell (who defeated Syracuse in the-other semi-final<br />\ngame) for the National Championship.<br />\nIn the title game, held on Memorial Day, Hopkins<br />\ndefeated the Big Red 11-10 to capture its 42nd national championship. The defense was superb, as<br />\nKessenich once again proved to be outstanding in the<br />\ncage. Senior co-captain Craig Bubier, playing with<br />\nan injured hamstring, scored four goals, the last being the game winner.<br />\nAt the team party in mid-June, the Hopkins team<br />\nbid farewell to its outstanding senior teammates.<br />\nGraduating were attackmen Brian Wood and Craig<br />\nBubier, perhaps the toughest one-two punch the sport<br />\nhad seen in over a decade. Also departing were Steve<br />\nMitchell, co-captain Bruce Chanenchuk, and Damon<br />\nStewart, the \"Rope\" unit that played so well all year<br />\nlong. Mitchell was awesome, gaining first team AllAmerican honors as a long stick midfielder, the first<br />\ntime such an award was ever given to a defensive<br />\nmidfielder. Larry LeDoyen who came along strongly<br />\nduring his senior year to play outstanding lacrosse,<br />\nwas an important factor in the Jay's offensive<br />\nscheme. Stuart Jones was a key player after 4 years<br />\nand epitomized the term \"team player.\" Mike<br />\nWebster, through spot play, gave the Jays depth at<br />\nmidfield defense when it was needed.

Most recently, he served as a defensive coach<br />\nfor the Jays.<br />\n- After three years as Coach Zimmerman's top assistant, Bill Tierney has left Hopkins to become head<br />\ncoach at Princeton. \"It was time for him to move<br />\non,\" commented Zimmerman, \"Princeton got a<br />\ngood man.\" Zimmerman predicts that Tierney can<br />\nmake the Tigers, currently one of the weaker Ivy<br />\nLeague teams, into one good enough to qualify for<br />\nthe NCAA tournament in two to four years.<br />\nLast summer, Coach Zimmerman along with<br />\ngraduated seniors Craig Bubier, Stuart Jones, Steve<br />\nMitchell, and Brian Wood,traveled to Japan for three<br />\nweeks to promote the sport of lacrosse in that country. The group held clinics and daily workouts. Zimmerman was very pleased with the trip and said that<br />\nthe Japanese have \"the potential to pick it [lacrosse]<br />\nup and do very well in it.\" He was encouraged by<br />\nthe sport's \"good backing in Japan\" and by the belief<br />\namong many Japanese lacrosse enthusiasts that the<br />\nnation \"can be succesful in international competition.\" Next summer, a group from the Keio University will spend a week at Homewood participating<br />\nin a clinic run by the Hopkins lacrosse staff.<br />\nAs lacrosse grows internationally, especially in an<br />\nOlympic year such as this, one cannot help but<br />\nwonder if the sport will ever return to the Summer<br />\nGames. In 1928 and 1932, lacrosse was an Olympic sport. Both years, the United States was<br />\nrepresented by a team from Hopkins. The first year<br />\nthe team tied for first place, the second it won.<br />\n\"Lacrosse has not much of a future in the real Olympics,\" says Coach Zimmerman. He blames the In-<br />\n<br />\nLacrossse is more of a<br />\nfinesse game...<br />\nternational Olympic Committee's strict requirements<br />\non the minimum number of nations which must compete internationally in the sport for it to be considered<br />\nfor admission.<br />\nZimmerman's reference to the Games as the \"real<br />\nOlympics\" serves to distinguish them from the<br />\nOlympics of Lacrosse, also known as the World<br />\nGames, a quadrennial event which last occurred in<br />\n1986 in Canada. This international competition,<br />\nwhich took place at Hopkins in 1982, involves<br />\nCanada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the<br />\nUnited States. Zimmerman served as an assistant<br />\ncoach of the United States team in 1986, and as an<br />\nalternate player in 1982.<br />\nOn the current state of international lacrosse,<br />\nCoach Zimmerman acknowledges the United States<br />\nas the dominant nation. He explains that the U.S.<br />\n\"has the total concept\" of the sport, with a \"settled<br />\nteam offense and defense\" similar to that used in<br />\nbasketball, and that the rest of the world's lacrosse<br />\nplaying countries have not yet reached this level of<br />\nplay.<br />\nNot all of the United States has achieved this \"total<br />\nconcept\" of lacrosse. In fact, Coach Zimmerman<br />\nbelieves that lacrosse west of the Appalachians is at<br />\na level considerably below that of Eastern lacrosse.<br />\nOf the West and Midwest, Zimmerman says,<br />\n\"They've just begun the game. The further west you<br />\ngo, the lower the level,\" he adds. He does, however,<br />\nsee progress in the lacrosse played in those regions.<br />\nIn the fall of 1988, the Hopkins lacrosse team will<br />\nhelp promote lacrosse west of the Mississippi by<br />\ntraveling to Michigan to play an exhibition against<br />\nthe Michigan State University lacrosse team. Last<br />\nseason, due to a new rule requiring that at least one<br />\nMidwestern or Western school be invited, Michigan<br />\nState participated in the NCAA Division I tournament. TI .; Spartans were eliminated in the first round<br />\nby North Carolina. Coach Zimmerman has said that<br />\nin the future he would also like the Jays to play Notre<br />\nDame's lacrosse team.<br />\nIn 1988, for the third consecutive year, the lacrosse<br />\n<br />\nnational championship will be decided in a Final Four<br />\nformat on Memorial Day weekend. The national<br />\nsemi-finals will be played Saturday, May 28th, and<br />\nthe finals on Monday, May 30th. After Final Fours<br />\nat the University of Delaware and Rutgers University, the semi-finals and championship game move<br />\n<br />\nA team needs more than<br />\nforty-eight hours to prepare<br />\nfor a lacrosse game.<br />\nindoors this year to the Carrier Dome on the campus of Syracuse University. The first-round and<br />\nquarterfinal games of the twelve-team tournament<br />\nwill once again be held at the home of the higherranked team.<br />\nCoach Zimmerman is not a major proponent of<br />\nthe Final Four structure. He argues that \"a team<br />\nneeds more than forty-eight hours to prepare for a<br />\nlacrosse game.\" Furthermore, he seems disturbed<br />\nby the refusal of the nation's most widely circulated<br />\nsports magazine to cover the championship in its current structure. Zimmerman explains that \"Sports Illustrated said that as long as we have the finals on<br />\nMemorial Day, they will not cover it.\" Memorial<br />\nDay marks the racing of the Indianapolis 500, an<br />\nFile Photo<br />\nevent of tremendous national interest that receives Don Zimmerman begins his fifth season as men's lacrosse<br />\nhead coach.<br />\nextensive coverage from Sports Illustrated.<br />\nween the end of the National Football League<br />\nRecently, there have been two major attempts to playoffs and the start of the college lacrosse schedule.<br />\nThe American Lacrosse League has yet to have<br />\npromote lacrosse beyond the collegiate and club<br />\nlevels into a professional sport.

This time comes every<br />\nnecessitate payment for it. The proposal four years, and when it comes, it<br />\nhaving been dropped, students might see is virtually impossible to read a<br />\nit as that much worse; here's a job that new magazine or watch the nighteveryone thinks is bad, but the University ly report without hearing mention<br />\nof it. That time has come again.<br />\nwon't even pay someone to do it.<br />\nI refer to Election 1988, of<br />\nThat's exactly why Weissman's proposal which you have already heard<br />\nwas dropped.,The Orientation chair is not close to your limit, I have no<br />\nsome horrific, slave-labor task. It is a doubt. But begrudge me a few<br />\npowerful position; the chairman, with the moments to belabor the issue.<br />\nhelp of many, is resonsible for presenting When I first wrote in this space<br />\nmonths ago, I discussed the<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University to incoming some<br />\nimportance of political involvefreshmen and their parents. Yes, it requires ment. It is time that I address the<br />\nmany long, hard hours; however, it is this subject again.<br />\nSomeone created a myth that<br />\nsacrifice on the part of the chairman and<br />\neveryone else which makes Orientation so single votes are assimilated by the<br />\nsystem and are therefore inspecial.<br />\nsignificant to the election. The<br />\nThere is nothing nicer than seeing famous paradox is, \"Would you<br />\nHopkins students knock themselves out to trade your right to vote for a new<br />\nmake the school's newcomers feel at car?\" \"Of course,\" comes the<br />\nhome\u2014and when done right, it is one class answer.\"My vote doesn't really<br />\nact. This year's Orientation, chaired by matter anyway.\"<br />\nIt is that myth that weakens the<br />\nLora Sims, has been evidence of that.<br />\npolitical infrastructure of this<br />\nWe hope that the talented members of the country. It is sad that many U.S.<br />\nundergraduate community will come out of pollsters consider one of the most<br />\nthe woodwork and take on the challenge of significant variables affecting an<br />\nOrientation chairman. Let's continue the election to be the weather on the<br />\ntradition of running a high-quality Orien- day of the vote. Truly, if rain is<br />\nenough to keep someone from<br />\ntation where students run it simply for its voting, how serious can they be<br />\nown sake, and await that week early next about the political process<br />\nSeptember during which there is no such anyway?<br />\nWe all have our favorite stories<br />\nthing as Hopkins apathy.<br />\ntold by high school civics<br />\nteachers about low voter turnout<br />\nin the U.S., but the percentage<br />\nitself is not so alarming as are the<br /><br />\nOne Class Act<br />\nSometimes that notorious Hopkins apathy<br />\nmakes itself even more apparent than usual<br />\naround here. This is just the case with the<br />\napplication for Orientation chairman.<br />\nResponse has been so poor that Student<br />\nCouncil Vice President Stephanie<br />\nWeissman has had to extend the application deadline.<br />\nPerhaps those who had considered applying turned cold to the idea once<br />\nWeisssman's recent proposal to Council for<br />\na paid Orientation chair was dropped.<br />\nGranted, the position requires an enormous<br />\namount of work during the summer, and<br />\nsummer employment is important for virtually every student. Furthermore, the<br />\ngeneral student attitude towards the job may<br />\nhave been altered once the possibility of<br />\nreimbursement was discussed.<br />\nTraditionally, the role of Orientation<br />\nchairman has been regarded as one of the<br />\n'student leader' roles on campus, analagous<br />\nto the MSE Symposium and Spring Fair<br />\nchairs. Students have vied for these<br />\nrespected positions.<br />\nProposing to pay the Orientation chairman might have cheapened the job. For<br />\nwhile the intentions were good and the<br />\nreasoning was logical, the proposal may<br />\nhave caused students to think that the job<br />\nis no longer considered to be on par with<br />\nthe likes of the MSE and Spring Fair positions, but is instead regarded by Council<br /><br />\nresults of the percentage. For<br />\nevery one person who does not<br />\nvote, the power of each cast ballot<br />\nis increased. In effect, every person that does not vote delegates<br />\ntheir right to those who do.<br />\nOne vote does count in this nation. We have the power to elect<br />\nour own government through the<br />\nElectoral College system, and it<br />\nis the ultimate hypocrisy to ignore<br />\nthat right. It is particularly<br />\nhypocritical to not vote and then<br />\nspend the entire term protesting<br />\nthe actions of the victor. The time<br />\nto act is now, when opinions really count\u2014not on campus next<br />\nyear, where opinions rarely go<br />\nbeyond Charles Street.<br />\nWorse than the apathetic who<br />\ndon't vote is the silent crowd<br />\nwhose mindset is apathetic, but<br />\nwho do vote. And yes, it is their<br />\nConstitutional right, but those<br />\npeople create a severe but<br />\nunderestimated threat to the<br />\npolitical stability of this nation<br />\nthrough their almost whimsical<br />\nvoting behavior. Many people<br />\ntend to remain absorbed in their<br />\ndaily lives and ignore the entire<br />\ncampaign, and they eventually<br />\nvote for the candidate who has the<br />\nnicest smile, the prettiest wife, or<br />\na donkey beside his name.<br />\nOften, we realize that we are<br />\nuninformed and try to pretend<br />\nthat we can still make effective<br />\nvoting decisions. That simply is<br />\nnot the case.

The period is important, because it is during this time that<br />\nthe pledge learns about, and hopefully<br />\nlearns to appreciate, that Greek organization to which he or she has made a commitment. Above all else, if brothers or<br />\nsisters cannot expose Greek values to their<br />\npledges, who will then carry them out as<br />\nthey themselves continue as members, the<br />\npledging has been a waste.<br />\nTraditions have evolved for brothers' and<br />\nsisters' behavior during pledge period to effectively instill these values in pledges.<br />\nDuties that are assigned to pledges are often<br />\nimportant in literally educating them in<br />\nfraternity history and tradition; activities<br />\nserve to educate pledges about brotherhood<br />\nand sisterhood in ways that often do not<br />\nbecome apparent until after pledge period<br />\nhas long been over.<br />\nPledge period's function, however, hardly runs contrary to good times\u2014neither do<br />\nfraternity values. The social atmosphere<br />\nmakes the experience all the more<br />\nworthwhile.<br />\nThe death of a Rutgers University<br />\nfreshman from alcohol poisoning stirred<br />\nRutgers to action. It has shut down the<br />\nfraternity in which the freshman was a<br />\npledge and temporarily suspended all frater-<br /><br />\nnity and sorority activities. Rutgers also announced that it would conduct an investigation to determine if the Greek system inherently put students at \"special risk.\" The<br />\nannouncement of the investigation comes<br />\nwith critical words of the system, even<br />\nbefore any work has begun.<br />\nHopkins faces the same potential problems by virtue of the fact that there is an<br />\nactive Greek system at Homewood.<br />\nPresently this system has a supportive,<br />\nalbeit pragmatic, relationship with the<br />\nHopkins community. An understanding has<br />\neffectively been reached on alcohol policy,<br />\nas self-policing remains a tenet of control.<br />\nThe Dean of Students office has also<br />\nroutinely sponsored substance abuse<br />\nawareness programs.<br />\nThere is no telling what kind of pressures<br />\nwould be exerted were a tragedy like that<br />\nwhich occured at Rutgers to be repeated at<br />\nHopkins. It is important that the positive<br />\natmosphere that exists would not simply be<br />\ntossed out the proverbial window.<br />\nFor the Greeks' part, nothing better than<br />\nresponsibility can help the community to<br />\nespouse the virtues they try to claim as their<br />\nown. During pledge period a commitment<br />\nto moderation and good sense must be made<br />\nby each Greek organization\u2014for the sake<br />\nof their new members and the system as a<br />\nwhole.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nBrad Handler, Elizabeth Harrigan<br />\nEditors<br />\nJulie Levine, Flory Ware<br />\nBusiness Manager<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nManaging Editor<br />\nAnn Ginsberg, Diana Zeiger<br />\nProduction Managers<br />\nEly Brown<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nNews Editors<br />\nPhil Gochenour, Mark W.

How many people want<br />\nto come back on campus to get<br />\ndinner? Sure, being able to pop<br />\nover to the cafeteria for lunch<br />\nmight be nice, but I think most<br />\npeople can brown bag an equally<br />\ngood lunch for much less than the<br />\ncost of food service.

She was raised in the<br />\ntradition of civil service: One<br />\nbrother worked for the New York<br />\nCity Fire Department, and<br />\nanother was a New York City<br />\ncop. She had this dream, and on<br />\nLong Island, where the police are<br />\nthe highest paid in the country,<br />\nher goal was a common one. The<br />\ncourse of events in many young<br />\npeople's lives is to work only<br />\nlong enough after high school<br />\ngraduation to reach the magical<br />\nage of twenty-one, which, along<br />\nwith being the age of alcoholic<br />\nconsent, is also the minimum age<br />\nto enter the police academy.<br />\nConsequently the competition<br />\nis intense.ln my county, Suffolk,<br />\nwhere The police start at over<br />\n$26,000 and jump to $49,000 in<br />\nonly three years, there is given an<br />\nentrance test every four years,<br />\nfrom which an elegibility list is<br />\nestablished and kept until the next<br /><br />\nexamination. In April 1984, the<br />\nlast year in which the test was<br />\ngiven, 14,000 people took the exam, competing for an estimated<br />\n100 openings in the next four<br />\nyears. Therefore it is clear that<br />\nthe dreams of many a young person quickly come to naught.<br />\nThis is the atmosphere in which<br />\nI was raised. Then I came to<br />\nBaltimore, a mere 250 miles<br />\napart<br />\neons<br />\naway, but<br />\nmetaphysically. College dimmed<br />\nmy constabulatory desires for a<br />\nwhile, as I, along with my peers,<br />\nspent a good deal of time joking<br />\nabout the local police force, often<br />\nseen by Hopkins students as<br />\nboorish lumps who hang out in<br />\nWaWa,or who are regularly seen<br />\nsmoking cigarettes in CVP. It<br />\nwas not until the dawn of my<br />\nsenior year, as I began to wonder<br />\nwhat would happen with my life<br />\nafter January's long anticipated<br />\ngraduation, that the spark lit up<br />\nagain.<br />\nI was walking around the<br />\nBaltimore City Fair one rainy<br />\nSunday in September when I<br />\nSee POLICE, 8<br /><br />\nLetters<br /><br />\n/17?<br />\n01/.<br />\nME!5-NE icrAN<br />\n\"Cvae-13u4e7,1.As,<br />\nGov.7-6<br />\n731/Alf\"Att (,k:<br />\nfeeGNAIEK!<br /><br />\n010Y\u201e Now.I AI&amp; mae<br />\nANY ykr/AN-BaN No,mosexemt<br />\n1.V. 171116-tiS/N6FA96511AieN<br />\n4q,600!<br />\n/A/ TAir &amp;OM?<br />\nfir 0415 wove<br />\n1-4N r atv<br />\nATMAGIHip!!<br /><br />\nuagoH satuvf iCq<br /><br />\nYOU<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n011111111v<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nmay find yourself living in a<br />\nshotgun shack. . . you may find<br />\nyourself in another part of the<br />\nworld. . .

It did not. Spike<br />\nLee, in fact, has improved under<br />\nColumbia Pictures. School Daze<br />\nhad even more depth and new<br />\nideas than his first success, She 's<br />\nGotta Have It.

Liza Trim<br /><br />\n'Daze' Credibility<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nJohn, in your review, you incorrectly uses phrases like \"blacks<br />\nonly Mission College\" and<br />\n\"reverse racism.\" Mission College is not a blacks only college,<br />\nit is a predominantly black college. \"Blacks only\" implies that<br />\nit is not open to members of<br />\nanother race. As for reverse<br />\nracism, this involves more than<br />\none race. Reverse racism is a subject Lee chose not to address in<br />\nthis movie.<br />\nYou stated, \"Lee throws in<br />\nridiculous song and dance treatment.\" The songs' words, how<br />\nthey were sung, and the style of<br />\ndance performed emphasized the<br />\ndifference between the Jigaboos<br />\nand Wannabees. The song and<br />\ndance competition is symbolic of<br />\na very real class division which<br />\nexists among blacks. You also<br />\ncomplain about \"long, boring<br /><br />\nscenes which have nothing to do<br />\nwith the preceding portions.\"<br />\nPerhaps you didn't understand the<br />\npreceding portions and, out of<br />\nconfusion, found them boring.<br />\nYour stating that the movie had<br />\na \"totally incomprehensible. . .ending\" only reiterates the<br />\nfact that you didn't get the gist of<br />\nwhat the movie was saying.<br />\nSchool Daze portrayed many<br />\npreviously unaddressed problems<br />\nthat are present within the black<br />\ncommunity. This movie definitely<br />\nwas not a \"careless and confusing depiction of blacks.\" \"None<br />\nof the characters are credible?\"<br />\nSpeaking from first-hand experience, the characters are very<br />\ncredible. One of the biggest enjoyments of the movie was being<br />\nable to relate to so much that was<br />\noccurring on the screen.<br />\nSpike Lee was far from being<br />\n\"wrapped up with fulfilling some<br />\nesoteric delusion.\" Many who<br />\nare very familiar with the black<br />\ncommunity and its diverse forms<br />\ncan relate to what Lee portrayed.<br />\nJohn, Lee did not \"falter,\" but<br />\nrather, you faltered when you<br />\nwrote this review without doing<br />\nyour homework.

This movie was<br />\nmade in order for people,<br />\nespecially Black people, to see the<br />\nwrong in the petty divisions<br />\nwithin the Black race. Mr. Lee<br />\nhad to pigeonhole Black people<br />\ninto various stereotypes in order<br />\nto emphasize this point. Furthermore, this movie has no reason<br />\nto be compared with \"Hollywood<br />\nShuffle,\" which illustrated the<br />\ntypecasting of Blacks by<br />\nHollywood. Their messages are<br />\nnot comparable.<br />\nFinally, and most importantly,<br />\nthe last line.of the film, \"Wake<br />\nup,\" summarizes Lee's whole intent of the movie. If Mr. Park<br />\nwould have in fact understood the<br />\nfilm he would have found the last<br />\nline quite \"a propos.\"<br />\nGeorgette B. Gaslcin<br /><br />\nAppropriate Programs<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nMonique R. Daniels<br /><br />\n'Daze' Relevancy<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am writing in response to the<br />\nreview of Spike Lee's film<br />\n\"School Daze\" by Mr. John<br />\nPark, and would like to set a few<br />\nthings straight. First of all, Mission College is not a \"Blacksonly college,\" it is a<br />\npredominantly Black school<br />\nwhich was founded around the<br />\nturn of the century (as were most<br />\npredominantly Black colleges) in<br />\norder to give Blacks a chance to<br />\nreceive a formal education. If one<br />\nhas enough insight as to even try<br />\nto remember the fact that Blacks,<br />\non the whole, were not allowed<br />\nto attend schools that Whites attended until the late 1950's, one<br />\nwould be able to see why these<br />\ncolleges were needed. In fact,<br />\nthese schools were financed, for<br />\nthe most part, by White philanthropists who believed in the<br />\neducation of all American<br />\ncitizens. Furthermore, today<br />\nthese schools are attended by people of various races.<br />\nSecondly, what did Mr. Park<br />\nmean by the statement \"reverse<br />\nracism?\" Did he mean that the<br />\nBlacks in the film were<br />\ndiscriminating against Whites?<br />\nWell, I find it quite humorous that<br />\nall of my friends who have seen<br />\nthe movie failed to find this<br />\n\"reverse racism.\" It is extremely difficult for me to believe that<br />\na person would have a problem<br />\nviewing a movie with a cast that<br />\nis all Black. I mean to say, I did<br />\nnot see even one Black person in<br />\n\"St. Elmo's Fire\" yet did not<br />\nhear anyone say that it was a<br />\nracist movie. The whole issue of<br />\n\"reverse racism\" is totally irrelevant when viewing this film.<br />\nThe third point that I would like<br /><br />\nI normally avoid the Hopkins<br />\nsport of Student Council-bashing<br />\nbecause I realize the power of the<br />\ngroup in any university is severely limited both by a lack of sufficient leverage within the administration and by the diversity<br />\nof opinions that such an organization necessarily has. To criticize<br />\na group in that position is unfair.<br />\nYet there seems to be a common goal of the Council that is<br />\nfeasible for them: the promotion<br />\nof parties (under the euphemism<br />\nof \"activities\") both on- and offcampus.

We are looking for<br />\npeople-oriented students to assist in the recruitment process by conducting the traditional on-campus interview.<br />\nIdeal candidates will enjoy speaking with prospective<br />\nstudents and their parents. Students must be poised and<br />\nmature and possess tact, diplomacy and the ability to put<br />\nhigh school students and their parents at ease.<br />\nTo be eligible, a student must be a senior next fall in good<br />\nstanding and plan to graduate in May 1989. Interns must<br />\nbe able to talk about Johns Hopkins in an inform 1 and<br />\npositive way, have a desire to participate in the recruitment process and be comfortable interacting with others.<br />\nInterns will be responsible for conducting admissions interviews with prospective students and meeting their<br />\nparents and responding to their questions and concerns.<br />\nIn addition, interns will compose written summary reports<br />\nof each interview. This will involve three or four hour-long<br />\ninterviews each week from September 21 through midDecember. These are paid positions.<br />\nThe initial interviews of interns will take place on March<br />\n28, 29 and 30 with second interviews scheduled on April<br />\n6, 7 and 8. The training program for those interns selected<br />\nwill be just after final examinations and at the beginning<br />\nof first semester next year.

Asked why he<br />\ncontinued to throw stones at the<br />\nsoldiers, the boy replied saying<br />\nthat his brother Muhammetl had<br />\ntold him to do so. The soldier,<br />\nfrustrated after having dodged<br />\nstones all day, ordered the boy to<br />\ntake him to Muharnmed. And so<br /><br />\nhe Obeyed and lead the Israeli<br />\nsoldier through the dirty and narrow streets of the camp till they<br />\nreached his one-room house. The<br />\nsoldier entered the home behind<br />\nthe little boy, who immediately<br />\npointed to the corner of his house.<br />\nThere, in the darkness of the<br />\nroom sat Muhammetl, a two year<br />\nold infant. The soldier left the<br />\nhouse in a sea of emotions.<br />\nSo what can we draw from this<br />\nstory? What does it symbolize<br />\nand so what? To the ordinary<br />\nreader the story may seem trivial<br />\nbut I urge you to see the simple<br />\ntruth that underlies it. For it<br />\nreflects the very nature of the current uprisings in the occupied territories. When you see a seven<br />\nyear old Palestinian throw a stone<br />\nat an Israeli soldier, do you ever<br />\nthink of why he does it or what<br />\ncauses him to do it? The real issue<br />\nhere concerns people, the Palestinian people in the occupied territories. They too, funny enough,<br />\nhave feelings, emotions, and concerns as we all do. They are fed<br />\nup of twenty years of Israeli occupation, of severe economic<br />\nrestrictions, of seeing their sons<br />\nbeaten and their husbands imprisoned. They struggle for a decent living and for their right to<br />\nself-determination to live as a<br />\ndignified people with basic<br />\nhuman and political rights. They<br />\nsearch for their identities in a<br />\nworld of poverty and refugee<br />\ncamps. And unfortunately their<br />\nonly possible means to express<br />\ntheir frustrations has been<br />\nthrough violence, nurtured by a<br /><br />\nhatred for the Israeli occupation.<br />\nBut why does this hatred exist?<br />\nThis is a question that I feel all<br />\nof us must ask ourselves,<br />\nespecially the Isrealis. Is a<br />\nPalestinian born with a gun in his<br />\nhand and an innate contempt for<br />\nIsraelis? What needs to be focused on are the root causes of the<br />\nproblem and not simply the<br />\nsymptoms that arise from it.<br />\nWhat people often tend to forget<br />\nwhen discussing the situation in<br />\nthe Middle East is the \"human<br />\nelement.\" It is a conflict between<br />\nvalues, beliefs, sentiments, and<br />\nabove all human souls. To fully<br />\nunderstand it you must enter the<br />\nminds and lives of the people involved and ask yourself \"why?\"<br />\nthis misery<br />\nWhat has caused<br />\nand bloodshed? This, I feel is of<br />\nthe essence.<br />\nPlease do not think that I oversimplify the problem. I am aware<br />\nof its complexity. My purpose<br />\nhere is not to offer a solution to<br />\nthe problem but rather an approach to be able to arrive at one.<br />\nI believe that the Israeli government should stop running away<br />\nfrom the reality that sits on its<br />\ndoorstep and as an occupying<br />\npower should help find a real<br />\nsolution to the Palestinian problem which is truly in its own interest. Accordingly, it should stop<br />\nusing brute force to suppress the<br />\nPalestinians knowing that it<br />\nbreeds only more bitterness and<br />\nresentment; and that it should<br />\nlisten with more care to what the<br />\ngrowing \"Peace Now\" movement in Israel has got to say. I say<br /><br />\nthis with a sense of urgency<br />\nbecause time is slowly running<br />\nout. Both sides of the conflict<br />\nhave suffered enough and if there<br />\nis ever a time for reconciliation,<br />\nit is now.<br />\nAnd in this day, the avenue to<br />\na \"peace process\" is somewhat<br />\non the horizon with talks of an international peace conference. My<br />\nhope is that all the parties concerned will meet together with<br />\nsome sense of understanding,<br />\ntolerance, and open-mindedness<br />\nrealizing that the fates of their nations lie intertwined. If this happens, a just and lasting peace<br /><br />\ncould possibly ensue.<br />\nIf not. \"Muhammed's\" little<br />\nvoice shall always continue to exist in the hearts of the Palestinians, pushing them on and on<br />\nand leading the Holy Land more<br />\nand more to its own doom.<br />\nFiras Raad<br /><br />\nVotem responsibly<br />\nnecessary to realize that Dick<br />\nGephardt scored zero percent on<br />\na free trade index for the 100th<br />\nCongress.

And,<br />\nmost importantly, vote when the<br />\ntime comes. Pat Roberston proved in Iowa that the silent mass<br />\nof voters who are usually<br />\napathetic can be mobilized and<br />\nutilized with comparatively little<br />\neffort. Robertson took second in<br />\nIowa largely because he convinced people who typically have a<br />\nvery low voter turnout that he<br />\ncould make a difference. And<br />\nthey made a difference for him.<br /><br />\nWe can't all work on a campaign staff. We can't even watch<br />\nthe news every day. It is hard to<br />\nfind the time to keep up with the<br />\nelection when the Washington<br />\nworld seems so far away, but it<br />\nisn't that far at all. We have the<br />\nopportunity to lift ourselves<br />\nabove the temptation to retreat into our campus shells and pretend<br />\nwe aren't voting Americans. Certainly it may take a bit of work,<br />\nbut how many people have shed<br />\ntheir blood so that we have the<br />\nright to learn about the candidates? Every qualified voter on<br />\nthis campus has the Constitutional<br />\nright to vote, and ignoring this<br />\nright or voting irresponsibly<br />\nwould be a travesty of the<br />\nAmerican political process.<br /><br />\nIz SENIOR CLASS PARTY<br />\n\"88 Days to Graduation\"<br />\nat<br />\nPJ's Recovery Room<br />\nSaturday, February 27<br />\n$4 All You Can Eat and Drink<br />\nfrom 6 - 9:30 p.m.<br />\nRecovery Room Happy Hour 9:30 - Midnite<br /><br />\n.\u201e<br />\n.\u201e<br />\n.\u201e<br /><br />\nVans Leave in Front of MSE 6 - 11 p.m.<br />\nEvery 1/2 Hour<br />\nNon Seniors Also Welcome<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/11<br /><br />\nACTIVITIES CALENDAR<br />\nAll Hopkins events are free unless otherwise noted.

These<br />\nare goal-directed tests. The<br />\nmedical school or the law<br />\nschool tells the test maker,<br />\n'these are the kinds of things<br />\nwe need. You design a test<br />\nthat tests these kinds of skills<br />\nand knowledge.' Obviously, if<br />\nyou do well in this test, which<br />\nis testing what you need in<br />\nlaw school or medical school<br />\nor business school, then you<br />\nshould do better in it.\"<br />\n\"However, I'm a firm<br /><br />\nbeliever that the grade point<br />\naverage is more important<br />\nthan the test score. There's<br />\nsomething wrong with comparing a 3 or 6 hour test with<br />\nthree or four years in school.<br />\nThe only balance of that is<br />\nthat so many grade point<br />\naverages vary. Some schools<br />\nhand out A's like party<br />\nfavors.. . sometimes<br />\njust<br />\nare<br />\nstudents<br />\nmemorizing.\"<br />\nThe Future of<br />\nAdmissions Tests<br />\n\"I have a self-interest in the<br />\nprocess, but there are many<br />\nthings wrong with the tests. If<br />\nthey just disappeared, I'd fold<br />\nup my tent and silently steal<br />\naway, but I don't think the<br />\ntests are going to disappear.<br />\nThe SAT's have become<br />\nmore and more important,<br />\nand for the other tests, I<br />\nbelieve that they will still be<br />\nimportant, but hopefully they<br />\nwon't be weighed as importantly. So far that isn't<br />\nhappening.\"<br />\nWhile Hopkins has not used<br />\nthe MCAT as an admissions<br />\ncriterion since September,<br />\n1986, Kaplan does not<br /><br />\nbelieve that abolition of the<br />\nMCAT is a trend that will<br />\nspread to other universities.<br />\n\"I haven't seen it. Usually<br />\nanother test is substituted for<br />\nit. Obviously, The Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School is a<br />\nwonderful medical school,<br />\nand the kind of applicants<br />\nthey get are top students<br />\nanyhow, so / don't think the<br />\nare going to make<br />\n'much<br />\nmuch of a difference one way<br />\nor another.\"<br />\nHopes For The<br />\nFuture of Admissions<br />\n\"Hopefully, for medicine,<br />\nthere will be a more<br />\nhumanistic attitude because<br />\nmost students consider it in<br />\nterms of practicality. If they're<br />\ngoing to medical school, and<br />\nin medical school know they'll<br />\nneed biochemistry and<br />\nhistology, they'll take these<br />\ncourses as undergraduates,<br />\nand eschew psychology,<br />\nsociology, and music. I think<br />\nthat's a big loss to them.<br />\nHopefully students will be<br />\nlooking at medicine not just<br />\nfor the bucks they're going to<br />\nearn, but for the contribution<br />\nthey can give . .<br /><br />\nprovoking things,\" with people<br />\nwondering whether or not to<br />\nguess, \"rather than worrying<br />\nabout the test itself.\" In recent<br />\nyears, the GRE and LSAT have<br />\nabolished their penalties for<br />\nguessing, possibly for the reason<br />\n, Kaplan states, \"and the validity<br />\nis still there,\" he says.<br />\nThe cost for all of this preparation is not cheap. Tuition for<br />\nKaplan courses range from $495<br />\nfor the GRE, $545 for the<br />\nMCAT, to $595 for the LSAT<br />\nand GMAT. However, according<br />\nto Kaplan, \"we've never turned<br />\ndown a student because of inability to pay.\" Of the over 120,000<br />\nstudents in all Kaplan courses,<br />\napproximately 10 percent have<br />\nfinancial aid.<br />\nFew believe that Stanley<br />\nKaplan truly exists. \"People<br />\nthink I'm just a name like Betty<br />\nCrocker or Sara Lee,\" he says.<br />\n\"But seriously,\" he adds, \"who<br /><br />\nA Bell<br /><br />\nAlthough he doesn't teach<br />\nanymore, Kaplan still gets a thrill<br />\n\"when a student is floundering. . .and suddenly sees the<br />\nlight.

I've always wondered<br />\nwhat that person would think.\"<br />\nSo says John Waters, director,<br />\nwriter, actor, and comic. His<br />\nlatest film, Hairspray, opens today at the Senator; the place<br />\nwhere, according to Waters, he<br />\nused to go for children's birthday<br />\nparties. \"I used to go to parties<br />\nin those private screening booths<br />\nall the time,\" he says.<br />\nThe film itself is set in a more<br />\ninnocent age as well.

It may be that<br />\nthese people needed to be ridiculed and quite honestly, it didn't<br />\ntake that much manipulation to do<br />\nit, but objectively, this is exactly<br />\nwhat I was refering to last week<br />\nwhen I mention the term media<br />\nterrorism. My example was that<br />\nof splicing Pope John Paul's<br />\nspeech on the Church's view of<br />\nbirth control with Madonna's<br />\n\"Like a Virgin. Zappa's record<br />\nis equally blatant. In certain<br />\nsections, he digitally alters the<br />\npitch and tone of the Senator's<br />\nvoices such that they begin to<br />\nresemble various barnyard<br />\nanimals: pigs, donkeys, and<br />\nchickens. He also carefully rearranges the contexts of the questions and answers, misrepresenting, if only slightly, the views of<br />\nthe speakers. No doubt, in Zappa's view, these misrepresentations better serve the public since<br />\nthey manage to remove the individuals from the false authority of their position and lower<br />\nthem to the level of a Bugs Bunny cartoon where even children<br />\ncan see the foolishness of their<br />\nviews.

Amongst these bands<br />\nwere the Minutemen. One of the<br />\nfirst bands on the then fledgling<br />\nSST label, the Minutemen were<br />\nknown for the fact that most of<br />\ntheir songs clocked in under one<br />\nminute. But what they could pack<br />\ninto that minute was often more<br />\nthan what most people could put<br />\ninto a six-minute opus.<br />\nMinutemen songs were, if<br />\nnothing else, aware and intelligently written, which made<br />\nthem stand out in a field populated by angst ridden singers<br />\nwho could only manage to say<br />\nthat the world sucked, and were<br />\nreally stuck to come up with<br />\nanything beyond that. Musically,<br />\nthe Minutemen sounded like a<br />\njazz trio, each player with a<br />\ndistinct style, pounding out their<br />\nown thing around a loose but<br />\nwell-defined core.<br />\nThe Minutemen managed to<br />\nput out eleven albums and EPs in<br />\nsix years, and when they weren't<br />\nin the studio recording, they were<br />\non the road touring. The Minutemen were one of the most productive bands around, and each<br />\nnew release chronicled the progression of a band that was<br />\nmaturing into something that<br />\nwent well beyond its original<br />\nhardcore beginnings. Tragically,<br />\nhowever, lead singer and guitarist<br />\nD. Boon died in an auto accident<br /><br />\nin 1985. With that, it looked like<br />\nthe end of everything the Minutemen had built up.<br />\nEnter Ed Crawford, longtime<br />\nMinutemen fan and guitar player.<br />\nCrawford pestered bassist Mike<br />\nWatt until they decided to give<br />\nhim a go, and Firehose was born.<br />\nFirehose's first album, Ragin',<br />\nFull On, picked up where the<br />\nMinutemen left off and even surpassed that point. Crawford<br />\nbrought with him a different set<br />\nof influences, not the least of<br />\nwhich was a tendency toward the<br />\nroots-rock style of such bands as<br />\nREM, which translated out into<br />\nhis vocal stylings and a much<br />\nfuller, cleaner guitar style. Songs<br />\nlike \"The Candle and the Flame\"<br />\nalso demonstrated a softer, more<br />\nemotional side to the band than a<br />\ndeparture from the more \"angry<br />\nyoung man\" oriented songs of the<br />\nMinutemen. The fates were not<br />\nkind when this album was released, however, and it was overshadowed by the release of Double Nickels on the Dime, a tworecord set of Minutemen songs.<br />\nLong-standing readers of this column will remember, however,<br />\nthat I urged everyone within earshot to go out and buy it.<br />\nI will unequivocally make the<br />\nsame statement for the new<br />\nFirehose album, Irn. If you never<br />\nlisten to me again, if you never<br />\nhave before, listen now: go buy<br />\nthis album. If you have any appreciation of music. whatever<br />\nstyle, you will appreciate this<br />\nalbum. Although lacking in some<br />\nof' the first album's anarchistic<br />\njazz energy, If'n is distinguished<br /><br />\nby a much more solid musical<br />\nstyle that seems to reflect a band<br />\nthat has decided to be three guys<br />\nplaying together, instead of three<br />\nguys just playing the same music.<br />\nCrawford's influence on this<br />\nalbum is also much deeper, including such things as more emphasis on acoustic instrumentation, and a very subtle, gentle<br />\nmusical style that evokes the<br />\nAthens, Georgia musical style<br />\nwithout being an emulation of it.<br />\nThis album, for example, includes one acoustic guitar/voice<br />\npiece which, if it is not outwardly dedicated to the memory of D.<br />\nBoon, is still perhaps the best<br />\nepitaph that anyone could ever<br />\nhope for. (Sadly enough, I don't<br />\nknow the name of this piece since<br />\nI was sent a test pressing which<br />\ndidn't label the songs.)<br />\nAlong with all this we have the<br />\nusual scat-like vocal stylings over<br />\nthe most minimal cymbal and<br />\nguitar work; the usual breakneck<br />\nromps of drummer George<br />\nHurley and bassist Mike Watt;<br />\nthe always expressive voice of<br />\nCrawford as he sings, wails, cajoles, questions, and asserts; and,<br />\nmost of all, still some of the best<br />\nlyrics in the biz, little phrasings<br />\nthat'll stick in your head for days,<br />\nand maybe even make you think a<br />\nlittle bit.<br />\nOnce again, I recommend this<br />\nalbum to everyone. Along with<br />\ngroups like the Replacements,<br />\nFirehose is one of the great hopes<br />\nfor American rock and roll in the<br />\neighties, and they deserve every<br />\nounce of support we can give<br />\nthem.<br /><br />\nty there ought to be some things<br /><br />\nthat remain apart, separate and<br />\ndistinct from the rest.

Henry Holt and Co.,<br />\n$16.95, 190 pp.<br /><br />\nby Noam M.M. Neusner<br />\nDispatches is a quick read, but<br />\na disturbing one. Woods has collected the articles he wrote over<br />\na two year period for the Daily<br />\nopposition<br />\nDispatch, an<br />\nnewspaper in South Africa. In the<br />\nbook, Woods characterizes the<br />\nSouth African regime with such<br />\ncandor it is hard to disagree with<br />\nhim. Each piece is an attack on<br />\nthe system of apartheid\u2014a system<br />\nof such complexity that it limits<br />\n\u2022 the way people live, from the<br />\nlanguage they learn in school to<br />\nwhere they sit in a park.<br />\nThe book is introduced by<br />\nnovelist Alan Paton as a \"book<br />\nin praise of freedom and in<br />\ndefense of freedom.\" After<br />\nreading the book, one would have<br />\nto join in with Paton's praise. I<br />\nwould go as far as to say the book<br />\nshould be read in any political<br />\nscience class discussing freedom.<br />\nWoods gives one example where<br />\nlove of freedom is contrary to<br />\nlove.of nation, a situation which<br />\ndoes not exist in this country or<br />\nin any democracy. South Africa<br />\nis not a democracy, nor is it an<br />\nacceptable dictatorship.<br />\nIt is not hard to say that apartheid is immoral. It has not been<br />\nsaid enough, however, that apartheid is impractical. Apartheid<br />\nreeks of stupidity and ignorance,<br />\nignorance not only of a black<br />\nman's right to liberty, but also ignorance of his potential ability to<br />\nreact against the current government. Woods' book is replete<br />\nwith different accounts of apartheid's impracticality. The reader<br />\nmay find these accounts redundant, but judging from an<br />\nAmerican's knowledge of apartheid, the accounts are necessary.<br />\nWoods' anger with apartheid<br />\ngrows within the book. His early<br />\narticles are a little immature,<br />\noften making their points with a<br />\nfinal, get-the-last-word-in attitude. Later, however, Woods<br />\nwrites angrily, and the humor<br />\nwhich existed early in the book<br />\ndisappears. Virtually all the later<br />\narticles are direct attacks against<br /><br />\ngovernment figures, primarily<br />\nPolice Minister Kruger. One can<br />\nnot help but be amazed that in an<br />\nopen letter to P.W. Botha, Woods<br />\nanswers Botha's claims that<br />\n\"Peking and Moscow would rejoice if the government is toppled,\" with: \"Well, most of the<br />\npeople in this country will rejoice . . .\" Wherein Wood lists<br />\nnot only every major city in South<br />\nAfrica, but every major city in the<br />\nworld. Only an angry man could<br />\nhave written and published such<br />\na response.<br />\nPerhaps the greatest contribution of Woods' book is his unique<br />\nperspective. Much has been written about how apartheid affects<br />\nblacks, but Wood includes whites<br />\namong the witnesses against apartheid. Woods describes the<br />\nsadness of living in a country<br />\nwhere your friendship with blacks<br />\nis restricted by space. You can<br />\nnot go to the same bathroom as<br />\na black man, nor can you sit on<br />\nthe same park bench. Woods expresses this sadness in each of his<br />\narticles: sadness that not even the<br />\nChurch actively opposes apartheid. That is why, one suspects,<br />\nmany English-speaking South<br />\nAfricans are leaving the country.<br />\nSometimes Woods' accounts<br />\nare extremely powerful, as when<br />\nhe attacks the government's<br />\ndispleasure with the BBC's<br />\n\"World at War\" series, which,<br />\nin a certain episode, graphically<br />\ndepicted the Dachau concentration camp. In one of the most<br />\npowerful paragraphs of the book,<br />\nWood laments: \"Yes, it is unpatriotic to love the things in your<br />\ncountry that are wrong. When the<br />\nDachau death camp was built,<br />\nHitler's men put up a sign outside<br />\nit: MY COUNTRY, RIGHT OR<br />\nWRONG. Those are among the<br />\nmost evil words ever written.\"<br />\nIf the South African government's intransigence is so strong,<br />\none can not make the argument<br />\nthat it is a government willing to<br />\nmake reform. There is no force<br />\nfor reform in South Africa from<br />\nwithin the government, nor will<br />\nthere ever be one. The<br />\nAfrikaaner, as expressed by<br />\nWoods, needs no friends and bitterly hates enemies. It is a<br />\ngovernment oblivious to the<br />\nworld around it.<br />\nWoods' attack of apartheid is<br /><br />\ndigenous residents of the most<br />\nsuccussful country on the continent. While a great deal can be<br />\nmade of their imbecilic racism,<br />\ntheir ingenuity and pride cannot<br />\nbe ignored. The Afrikaaner cannot be characterized just as a<br />\nracist: that would be a mistake<br />\nwhich would be just as ignorant<br />\nas any Afrikaaner's bigotry.<br />\nWoods' obliviousness to the<br />\nvolatile element of black leadership and also his ignorance of<br />\nAfrikaaner belonging detracts<br />\nfrom his main argument.<br />\nNonetheless, his testimony<br />\nagainst the current government is<br />\noverwhelming. After reading<br />\nabout the arrests, deaths in detention, and lack of freedom in South<br />\nAfrica, one cannot help but insist<br />\nthat something be done there.<br />\nWoods fails, however, in<br />\nexemplary in its frankness, hav- prescribing any viable solution,<br />\ning reduced the concept of and it is this failure which symAfrikaaner nationalism to mere bolizes our own helplessness.

This is a column strictly<br />\nabout baseball. I do not pretend<br />\nto \u2022be interested in, much less<br />\nknowledgeable about, any sport<br />\nthat does not include balls and<br />\nrubbers among its primary equiment. I think that it is simply that<br />\nsports readers are tired of reading<br /><br />\narticles entitled \"Blue Jays Lose<br />\nAgain,\" and have thus attached<br />\ngreat hopes for variety to my<br />\nweekly journalistic ventures. But<br />\nthis is meant as nothing but an innocent baseball column. ,<br />\nSo. . .the envelope, please, for<br />\nthe National League East.<br />\n1 Philadelphia Philllies. No,<br />\nI'm not picking them just to be<br />\ndifferent. The Phillies have<br />\ntremendous strengths in Schmidt,<br />\nSamuel, Hayes, Parrish, Bradley,<br />\netc. They're similar to the<br />\nYankees in that they do have a<br />\nweakness at shortstop, but the<br />\nPhillies are a smart organization;<br />\nthey'll overcome that. The rotation is unheralded but passable,<br />\nand although I still don't believe<br />\nSteve Bedrosian was the best pitcher in the league last year, he is,<br />\na fine reliever.<br />\n2 New York Mets. Everyone's<br /><br />\nfavorite pick has a lot of unasked<br />\nquestions. Is Keith Hernandez<br />\nstarting to slip? Is Gary Carter<br />\nthrough as a catcher? Will the<br />\nfront office try to make baseball<br />\nfun for Kevin McReynolds, Ron<br />\nDarling, and Mookie Wilson instead of either ripping them in arbitration or, in the case of<br />\nMookie, keeping a talented outfielder unhappy as the fourth outfielder? And why in hell did<br />\nDavey announce his retirement a<br />\nyear early? The Mets, in just two<br />\nyears, are eagerly trading roles<br />\nwith their crosstown rivals,<br />\nbecoming baseball's resident soap<br />\nopera while the Yankees<br />\nmonolithically move into contention. Sorry, but I think the Mets<br />\nare<br />\n_ fading.<br />\n3 Pittsburgh Pirates. The problem with once-bad teams is that,<br />\nonce they're ready to improve,<br /><br />\n\\ext W<br />\nLACROSSE '88<br /><br />\nthe media still won't pay any attention to them until they're<br />\nalready off and running. But it<br />\nwould be a mistake to ignore the<br />\nPirates. Short of sticking with one<br />\ndouble-play combination, the<br />\nPirates do have a lot of weapons,<br />\nincluding a staff that could be the<br />\ndivision's second-best (behind the<br />\nMets). They're gonna be good.<br />\n4 Montreal Expos. In a holding<br />\npattern, the Expos seem determined to run a balanced ledger\u2014<br />\nevery plus should be evened with<br />\na minus.

And everyone who<br />\nthinks that Perez and Martinez<br />\nwill go 18-4 again, please excuse<br />\nyourselves from this discussion.<br />\n5 St. Louis Cardinals.

Beginning his fifth season as head<br />\ncoach of men's lacrosse at Hopkins, Zimmerman has<br />\nalready led the Blue Jays to three national titles. He<br />\nwants more, and he believes his 1988 squad is<br />\ncapable of accomplishing this goal.<br />\nWith fifteen returning lettermen, including three<br />\nAll-Americans and a group of talented newcomers,<br />\nZimmerman attempts to lead Hopkins to its 43rd national championship. But the Jays will have to replace<br />\nfour graduated seniors who figured in AllAmerican honors a year ago.<br />\nATTACK<br />\nOn offense the Blue Jays lost to graduation one<br />\nof the most prolific scoring combinations of their<br />\nhistory. Gone are Craig Bubier and Brian Wood, who<br />\ncombined for 192 goals and 109 assists in their four<br />\nyears at Hopkins. Their collaboration began when<br />\nthe two played together at St. Mary's High School<br />\nin Baltimore.<br />\nTo replace Bubier and Wood the Jays retain senior<br />\nco-captain Mike Morrill, a third team All-American<br />\nlast season. Mon-ill led the Jays in scoring in '87 with<br />\n31 goals and 16 assists, and will be starting for the<br />\nfourth consecutive year. He will be joined by juniors<br />\nJohn Ciccarone (in '87 9 goals, 10 assists) and Jeff<br />\nIhm (5 goals,6 assists). Ciccarone managed to score<br />\nin each of Hopkins' championship tournament wins<br />\na year ago.<br />\nSophomores Scott Man- and Jay Clarke should get<br />\nsignificant playing time this year. Last year Clarke<br />\nfound the net twice for Hopkins while Marr recorded four goals and five assists. This sophomore duo<br />\nwill be joined by a fine crop of freshmen to round<br />\nout the attack, including Steve McElroy (Edgewood,<br />\nMD), Michael Morrissey (Massapequa, NY), Matt<br />\nPanetta(Elmont, NY), and John Sheehan (Towson,<br />\nMD). Hopkins coaches are particularly high on<br /><br />\nJess Bunshatt<br /><br />\nPanetta, who could turn out to be the next Mike Mor- on this year's squad are Bill Dwan (Yorktown, NY),<br />\nrill of the bunch. In 1985 Mon-ill stepped into the Jamie McNealy (Severna Park, MD), Tom Raley<br />\nBlue Jay starting line-up fresh out of high school and (Baltimore, MD), and Brian Voelker (Baltimore,<br />\nscored the winning goal in the opener against MD). Word has it that Dwan and Voelker are the<br />\nSyracuse. Unless a freshman has such a surprise in ringers among this bunch.<br />\nstore this year, however, Hopkins goal-production<br />\nGOAL<br />\nmight go down from 1987.<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nAt midfield the Jays suffer two major losses. Both<br />\nfirst team All-American Steve Mitchell and second<br />\nteam All-American Larry LeDoyen graduated last<br />\nMay. Mitchell was the first long-stick midfielder in<br />\ncollegiate lacrosse history to be named to the first<br />\nteam defense, while LeDoyen enjoyed a stellar season<br />\nregistering 19 goals and 15 assists. LeDoyen, who<br />\ntransferred from Virginia for the 1986 campaign,<br />\nhighlighted his 1987 season by sparking fourth<br />\nquarter rallies in games against Rutgers and North<br />\nCarolina.<br />\nTo help replace these two the Jays still have senior<br />\nco-captain Jack Crawford, who was forced to miss<br />\nthe entire 1987 season due to a knee injury. In addition, Joe Rzempoluch will return after having missed all of '87 as well. The Jays therefore retain two<br />\nstar midfielders not even available last year during<br />\nHopkins' championship drive. The return of Rzempoluch is particularly heartening since in 1986 he<br />\ndeveloped into one of the game's leading face-off men.<br />\nJunior Greg Gunning handled these duties for<br />\nHopkins last year, so the Blue Jays should have the<br />\nmost depth in the nation in this pivotal area.<br />\nAlso returning are juniors John Dressel, Brendan<br />\nKelly, John Wilkens, and Pat Russell. Dressel scored<br />\ntwelve times for the Jays in '87, while Kelly led all<br />\nreturning Jays in scoring with 15 goals and 10 assists.<br />\nIt was John Wilkens who got things going for<br />\nHopkins in last year's semi-final victory over<br />\nMaryland with a blistering score early in the first<br />\nquarter. The midfield is rounded out by sophomore<br />\nGreg Lilly (5 goals, I assist) and freshman Mark<br />\nDressel (Timonium, MD), Jim Harkin (Setauket,<br />\nNY), Seth Tierney (Wantaugh, NY)and Jay Wright<br />\n(Littleton, CO).<br />\nDEFENSE<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nDefense is the area from which Hopkins has lost<br />\nno players from its 1987 championship squad. No<br />\nBubiers, Mitchells, LeDoyens, or Woods to replace<br />\nhere. Rather, the Jays return first team All-American<br />\nDave Pietramala, and juniors Steve Ciccarone, James<br />\nDeTommaso, and Greg Lilly. This is the combination that not only gained experience in 1987, but proved good enough to help furnish that forty-second<br />\nNCAA title. Joining perhaps the best starting defense<br />\nin the nation will be seniors Eric Shaw and Nils<br />\nYoungwall, juniors Chris Chirieleison and Chip<br />\nDates, and sophomore Dave Howland. The freshmen<br /><br />\nA funny thing happened to Hopkins on their way<br />\nto a lacrosse championship last year. They found<br />\nthemselves an All-World goalie. Just as Jays fans<br />\nwere getting used to the fact that Larry Quinn was<br />\ngone, never to return, super saves and everdependable play reappeared in front of the Hopkins<br />\nnet.<br />\nIt all started in the middle of last season when the<br />\nlistless Jays were 3-2 and apparently prepared to kiss<br />\n1987 goodbye in the game against North Carolina.<br />\nThe Blue Jays had just been upset 9-7 by Virginia<br />\nat Homewood, and had never won a game at<br />\nCarolina's Fetzer Field. On a whim, preparing for<br />\nthe future perhaps, Zimmerman decided to start<br />\nfreshman goaltender Quint Kessenich. The rookie<br />\nresponded with 21 saves in Hopins' 11-10 comefrom-behind victory. The following week at<br />\nHomewood, Kessenich would stop 19 shots against<br />\nArmy and eventually end the season with a .619 save<br />\npercentage. The Jays went 7-1 with the freshman in<br />\nthe net, beating North Carolina in the quarterfinals,<br />\nand downing undefeated Maryland and Cornell teams<br />\nfor the championship. Kessenich was awarded with<br />\na third team All-American spot.<br />\nThere is a postscript to this story, however\u2014a<br />\nslightly unfortunate one. Kessenich was suspended<br />\nalong with defenseman Dave Howland for the first<br />\ngame of the season. There seems to have been some<br />\nsort of altercation at the Northway Apartments.<br />\nDefenseman James DeTornmaso was also in on the<br />\naction, but will not miss a game. In Kessenich's place<br />\nfor the opener against Syracuse will be senior Jeff<br />\nKramer, who saw six shots of action all last season.<br />\nA win here without Kessenich could foreshadow an<br />\nundefeated season for the Jays.<br />\nCOACHES<br />\nFor the 1988 season, two new faces join the<br />\nHopkins coaching staff. A 1987 graduate of Hopkins,<br />\nthree-time first-team All-American Brian Wood will<br />\nwork as a scout for the Jays. John Haus, formerly<br />\nan assistant coach at Loyola High School, will help<br />\ncoach defense. Returning from last year's staff are<br />\ndefensive coach Jerry Pfeifer, offensive coordinator<br />\nJoe Devlin, and goalkeeper coaches Les Matthews<br />\nand Brian Holman.<br />\nFred Smith, who had been involved in Blue Jay<br />\nlacrosse for the past forty years, passed away this<br />\nsummer.

thought to be a rebuilding season. Yet, when<br />\nthe dust finally cleared, they found themselves once<br />\nagain NCAA champions. How then can the Jays fail<br />\nto bring home the title this year? This is the question that Hopkins' opponents will be asking<br />\nthemselves as the Jays shoot for their forty-third national championship.<br />\nCoach Zimmerman's team took some hard knocks<br />\nin 1987, losing games to Syracuse, Virginia, and<br />\nMaryland. Hopkins will again face these teams, plus<br />\nperennial power North Carolina, in '88 in a schedule<br />\nthat mimics that of a year ago; Hopkins plays the<br />\nsame ten teams this year as last.<br />\nFortunately for this season's Jays, most of the<br />\ntraditional lacrosse giants are to be met at home,<br />\nnotably Maryland, North Carolina, and Syracuse.<br />\nHowever, these teams are ranked second, third, and<br />\nfifth, respectively, by the U.S. Intercollegiate<br />\nLacrosse Association, and Hopkins must travel to<br />\nplay the sixth-ranked Virginia squad that upset the<br />\nJays at Homewood last year. Also, Hopkins must<br />\nface on the road the seventh-ranked Navy team and<br />\nthe twelfth-ranked Army team. The Blue Jays just<br />\nbarely got by both Army and Navy in 1987. In the<br />\nother four games on the schedule (against Rutgers,<br />\nWashington College, Princeton, and Towson State)<br />\nHopkins stands really no chance of losing.<br />\nHere is a look at the 1988 Blue Jay's schedule,<br />\nweek by week:<br /><br />\nSYRACUSE<br />\nSaturday, March 5<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 10-4<br />\nThe Division I semi-finals and championship game<br />\nare being held at Syracuse University's Carrier Dome<br />\nthis year, so the Orangemen are assuming if they can<br />\nmake it that far, the title may very well be theirs.<br />\nThey hope to start their march to the top in the season<br />\nopener tomorrow against the Jays.<br />\nThe past five seasons have seen the Syracuse-Johns<br />\nHopkins lacrosse rivalry develop into one of the most<br />\nheated in American sports. The Jays allowed<br />\nSyracuse a come-from-behind victory in the 1983<br />\nfinal, only to soundly defeat them in the same game<br />\na year later. In 1985 the tradition started of facing<br />\nSyracuse on the first day of the season, and Hopkins<br />\ncomplied with a victory. In the following season's<br />\nopener, Zimmerman suffered his first defeat at<br />\nHomewood Field as the Orangemen handed Hopkins<br />\nan 11-10 loss. Playing in sub-freezing temperatures,<br />\nthe Jays were edged out despite a fourth quarter barrage in which Craig Bubier's shot whizzed just above<br />\nthe crossbar with twenty seconds to play. In last<br /><br />\nTimothy Nichols\u2014Lacrosse Magazine<br /><br />\nyear's game the weather proved no factor as Syracuse<br />\nwent on to a 15-14 overtime win in their home opener<br />\nat the Carrier Dome.<br />\nSaturday, March 12<br />\nThis year the action returns to Homewood Field Chestertown, MD<br />\nas the Orangemen are ranked number five after having lost to Cornell in the 1987 semi-finals. (Cornell 2:00 p.m.<br />\nwent on to lose to Hopkins in the final.) In 1988, Series Record: Jays lead 27-1<br />\nSyracuse has lost fourteen seniors, including twoWashington College is a Division III team that<br />\ntime first team All-American midfielder Todd Curry,<br />\nstarting goalie Jim Gyory, and leading attackmen Hopkins plays virtually every year and virtually never<br />\nloses to.

Also returning fort against Hopkins may be one of their strongest<br />\nis sophomore goalie Matt Palumb, who played well ones to date. Add to this the fact that they face the<br />\nlast year in games against Army and Brown, and who Jays at home, and maybe the Shoremen really do<br />\nmay have started more games for the Orange had have a chance to pull off a major upset.<br />\nBut probably not. After all, the Jays thrashed them<br />\nhe not been injured.<br />\nThe Orange traditionally play a run-and-gun type 23-7 last year at Homewood, and with the return of<br />\noffense, scoring a lot of goals. To counter this, the Kessenich in goal for Hopkins, the ratio of<br />\nJays hope to utilize their superior passing and ball- Washington College goals to the Jays' may be even<br />\ncontrol game. The key to this year's contest, lower. Nonetheless, the Shoremen do return highhowever, may lie in the fact that Hopkins' sophomore scoring attackman. Tim Hormes(40 goals, 5 assists<br />\nsensation goaltender Quint Kessenich has been in '87) and offense-minded midfielders Mike<br />\nsuspended by Zimmerman for one game. In his stead McGuane(27 goals, 16 assists) and Chris Dollar(28<br />\nwill be Jeff Kramer, a capable senior, but one who goals, 1 assist).<br />\nStill, the Blue Jays could be particularly hungry<br />\nfaced only six shots on goal in 1987, saving four of<br />\ncoming off a loss to Syracuse. Or maybe they will<br />\nthem.<br />\nFor this reason alone the Hopkins-Syracuse game beat the Orange. Either way, they should win big<br />\ntomorrow is hard to pick.

Hopkins<br />\nassistant coach Bill Tierney has moved on to<br />\nPrinceton to take over the head reins there. Maybe<br />\nhis knowledge of the Blue Jay system can prevent<br />\na few goals scored against his new team.<br />\nBut not too many.

There is nothing to lose; not<br />\nfor the Jays anyway.<br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 19, Princeton 4<br /><br />\nVIRGINIA<br />\nSaturday, April 2<br />\nCharlottesville, VA<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 43-9-1<br /><br />\nIn the past few years Hopkins' rivalry with North<br />\nCarolina has exceeded in excitement and intensity<br />\neven that with Syracuse. Just when you think the Jays<br />\nand the Tar Heels have played the greatest game of<br />\nall time, their next match is even closer.<br />\nIn 1982 Carolina beat Hopkins 13-12 in overtime,<br />\nonly to lose to them the following year 14-13 in double overtime. In 1984 it was 4-3 Hopkins, followed<br />\nby a UNC 11-10 overtime victory in 1985. In '86<br />\nthe Jays routed the Heels in the regular season only<br />\nto blow a fourth quarter 9-6 lead in the semi-finals<br />\nand lose to Carolina 11-10 in overtime. Last year<br />\nthe Jays won for the first time ever at Chapel Hill,<br />\n11-10, and then hosting the Tar Heels in the quarterfinals beat them by the same score. Put simply,<br />\nwhenever Johns Hopkins and North Carolina take<br />\nthe field together, chances are the game will be decided by one goal, quite possibly in overtime.<br />\nThis year, however, just may be a year when<br />\nHopkins can win semi-comfortably. North Carolina<br />\nis ranked number three but was expected to win it<br />\nall last season, not finish fifth. Having lost seven<br />\nstarters to graduation, Coach Willie Scroggs' team<br />\nshould have to scratch and claw to reach a high playoff spot. Among the seven lost to graduation are included three defensive starters, most notably threetime first team All-American and 1986 National<br />\nPlayer-of-the-Year Tom Haus. Also gone are two<br />\nstarting attackmen, including two-time Heel leading<br />\nscorer Gary Seivold, hero of the 1986 championship<br />\ntournament. Carolina has also incurred losses at midfield, most glaring the graduation of first team AllAmerican Joey Seivold.<br />\nTo take the places of the departing stars North<br />\nCarolina has a lot of bodies but no big names. One<br />\narea furnishing a familiar face is goaltending: Barney<br />\nAburn is to start for the third straight season for<br />\nUNC. But Aburn slumped last year, and if he does<br />\nnot regain his 1986 form the Heels may prove no<br />\nmatch for teams like Hopkins. On April 9th, look<br />\nfor a replay of the '86 game as Hopkins puts in gear<br />\nits drive to the '88 championship.<br /><br />\nVirginia had a strange season in 1987. Having narrowly missed an NCAA championship in their overtime loss to Carolina a year before, the Cavaliers<br />\nallowed themselves an early-season defeat at the<br />\nhands of Brown. It was simply the biggest win in<br />\nBrown's history. A few weeks later, coming into<br />\nHomewood with a 4-2 record, the Cavs upset the Prediction: Hopkins 14, North Carolina 8<br />\nJays and lifted their ranking to number six in the nation. They then proceeded to lose their next four<br />\ngames and remove their chances for even a top-12<br />\nSaturday, April 16<br />\nseed and a playoff-berth.<br />\nyear,<br />\nThe problem for other NCAA teams this<br />\nWest Point, NY<br />\nhowever, is that during Virginia's demise and injury- 7:00 p.m.<br />\nridden season of '87, they deveopled a nucleus of<br />\ntalented underclassmen to step in and keep the Cavs Series Record: Jays lead 43-13<br />\nrespectable. This raw-talented nucleus in now experienced and liable to bring UVA all the way to<br />\nSyracuse and the final-four this Memorial Day<br />\nweekend.<br />\nA year ago, for example, first-team All-American<br />\nCav goaltender Peter Sheehan came down with<br />\nmononucleosis. He was replaced by freshman Stew<br />\nRidgely, who responded with a .613 save percentage and 16 stops in the win over Hopkins. Another<br />\nthen-freshman, midfielder Andy Kraus, won 42 of<br />\nhis first 64 face-offs. In addition, Virginia will field<br />\nthree seniors in 1988 who had the best seasons of<br />\ntheir careers in '87. Bob Schulper led the inner<br />\ndefense in ground balls while attackmen Chase<br />\nMonroe and Doug Amacher developed into one of<br />\nthe top scoring combos in the country.<br />\nSo it is clear that the Cavaliers have talent. They<br />\nhave been duly ranked sixth in the pre-season poll.<br />\nBut can they convert their talent into a victory over<br />\nHopkins? Such a result is possible, but the Jays have<br />\nbeen known for some good players of their own, so<br />\nthat when the shooting is over at Charlottesville, look<br />\nfor another hard-fought Hopkins victory.<br /><br />\nARMY<br /><br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 10, Virginia 6.<br /><br />\nArmy's bag is mixed concerning players returning from their seventh-ranked 1987 team. At attack<br />\nthe Cadets lose high scorers Doug Shaver and Joe<br />\nGillis, but retain Rob Betchley, who scored three<br />\ntimes in Army's 11-9 defeat last year at Homewood.<br />\nBetchley will be looking for feeds in front of the net<br />\nby a midfield squad entirely intact from a year ago.<br />\nAt defense Army loses two standouts from last<br />\nseason, Dan Williams and Tom Hickman, but the<br />\nCadets feel that in goalie Joel Portuese they possess<br />\nthe best netminder in the nation.<br />\nLast year at Homewood the Jays trailed Army for<br />\nmore than a half only to reverse a fourth-quarter<br />\ndeficit and beat the Cadets 11-9. This was the game<br />\nwhere freshman Quint Kessenich started for the first<br />\ntime at home and cemented the number one goaltending job by stopping nineteen Army shots. This year<br />\nthe Jays must travel up to West Point and meet the<br />\nCadets at Michie Stadium. It was here where Army<br />\nwas eliminated from the 1987 championship tournament by lesser ranked Adelphi, 6-5.

Add<br />\nthis to the fact that April 23rd is Homecoming at<br />\nJHU, and Homewood Field should really be packed for this battle between the two top-ranked teams<br />\ncoming into the 1988 season.<br />\nUnfortunately for Hopkins, Maryland's roster also.<br />\nlooks packed\u2014with talent. A bevy of seniors return<br />\nfrom the 1987 squad that lost to the Jays in the semifinals 13-8. This is particularly true at midfield. Gone<br />\nto graduation is four-year standout Brian Willard,<br />\nbut the Terrapins retain All-American senior Tom<br />\nWorstell. Add to him Guy Riccardi, Chris Sullen,<br />\nand Tom Bedard, and Maryland possesses the most<br />\nexperienced midfield squad in the country.<br />\nAt attack, the Terps suffered some heavy losses,<br />\nlosing to graduation two out of three from their<br />\nawesome '87 offense, Mike Mosko and Kirk<br />\nThurston. But in senior Brendan Hanley they retain<br />\nperhaps the best of the bunch. Hanley will be joined<br />\nby another senior capable of scoring goals, Mike<br />\nSee SCHEDULE,8<br /><br />\n8 / MARCH 4, 1988<br /><br />\nMaryland, Navy, Towson round out season<br />\nSCHEDULE, from 7<br />\nSmith. In the net, Maryland loses All-American Jim<br />\nBeardmore, who stopped 75% of all shots coming<br />\nat him before he faced the Hopkins guns in the semifinals a year ago. To replace him will be a senior<br />\nwith some experience, Dennis Sullivan, if sophomore<br />\nWillie Griffin does not get a chance.<br />\nOne area which could prove the deciding factor<br />\nin the game against Maryland is face-offs, where the<br />\nTerrapins lost Todd Ensor, a senior a year ago who<br />\nwon 16 of 21 face-offs in the Terps' regular season<br />\n11-7 victory at College Park. But this year the Jays<br />\nget their face-off specialist back, Joe Rzempoluch.<br />\nAdd this to the fact that the game will be played at<br />\nHomewood, and the Jays should eke out their narrowest victory of the campaign.<br /><br />\nan NCAA tournament record. At midfield, the Midshipmen enjoy almost as much experience as the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland, employing three seniors including All-American Frank Snyder. Finally, the<br />\nstarting defense is filled with nothing but juniors and<br />\nseniors, led by team captain Jim Darcy.<br />\nLast year the Jays played listless lacrosse against<br />\nNavy at Homewood, nearly handing the Midshipmen<br /><br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 10, Navy 9<br /><br />\nTOWSON STATE<br />\nSaturday, May 7<br />\nHomewood Field<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 12-0<br />\nCoach Carl Runk recently said the following about<br />\nhis Towson State Tigers lacrosse team, according<br />\nto the Towson State Sports Information Office: \"It's<br />\nhard to place a price tag on what we lost last year.<br />\nWe had a phenomenal bunch of seniors and the<br />\nleadership we received at each position on the field,<br />\nat practice, off the field, it was just overwhelming.\"<br />\nThis was a team Hopkins defeated 13-7 at Towson<br />\nlast year, so you can imagine just how well the Jays<br />\nshould do in '88 at Homewood. Gone are Tiger stars<br />\nJeff Peek, Richard Winkoff, and Jeff Dumpson. In<br />\n'87 the Tiger attack recorded 97 goals and 82 assists,<br />\nbut their only returning attackrnan this season is<br />\nsophomore Pat Gress, who as a sub in '87 recorded<br />\nthree goals and five assists.<br />\nSo it is clear that the Tigers are hurting. They will<br />\nretain sophowe goalie Dave Linthicum, who<br />\nwrested the starting job away from senior Tom<br />\nManos in the middle of last season, but this will not<br />\nnearly be enough to beat a Jays team looking to gain<br />\nmomentum for the playoffs.<br /><br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 11, Maryland 10<br /><br />\nNAVY<br />\nSaturday, April 30<br />\nAnnapolis, MD<br />\n2:00 p.m.<br />\nSeries Record: Jays lead 33-25-1<br />\nDon't look now, but this could be Navy's best year<br />\nsince 1970 when the Mids last won an NCAA<br />\nlacrosse championship. Last year they enjoyed their<br />\nbest season since 1979, finishing sixth in the country. This year Navy returns five All-Americans and<br />\neight of their top ten scorers.<br />\nIn goal the Midshipmen retain Joe Donnelly,a<br />\nsenior who played well in Navy's come-from-behind<br />\n10-9 defeat last year at Hopkins. On attack, Navy<br />\nleading scorer Paul Basile returns, a junior AllAmerican who recorded 8 assists in the Mids' 1987<br />\n14-6 play-off victory over Brown. The 8 assists are<br /><br />\na come-from-behind fourth quarter victory. This year<br />\nthe Mids are better, and so are the Jays, but the game<br />\nis being held at the Naval Academy. This game,<br />\ntherefore, like the Maryland game, is loseable. Look<br />\nfor a strong showing by Navy and a narrow victory<br />\nby Hopkins.<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nPrediction: Hopkins 16, Towson State 4<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022%%%%%%\\%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\\%%%%%4,%1040.%%\u2018%%%%%%%%.,<br />\n,<br />\n,<br />\n,% 104.%\u2022%<br /><br />\nGO WITH THE WINNERS<br /><br />\nGO BLUE JAYS<br />\nBEAT SYRACUSE<br />\nYour Victory Decides the Value<br />\nof our Coupon<br /><br />\nLacrosse Magazine, the official publication of The Lacrosse Foundation<br />\nNewton H White Jr Athletic Center<br />\nHomewood<br />\nBaltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\n301-235-6882<br /><br />\n*If Hopkins Wins by 2 or more<br />\ngoals, this ad is worth<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 off any pizza*<br />\n*If Hopkins Wins by 1 goal,<br />\nthis ad is worth $2.00<br />\noff any pizza*<br />\n*No matter what the score, this<br />\nad is worth $1.00 off any<br />\npizza*<br />\n\u201433rd at Charles-467-0802\u2014<br /><br />\nLACROSSE '88 / 9<br /><br />\nBlue Jays top this season's early polls<br />\nby Robert Brenner and Gopal Kowdley<br />\nWell, for all those freshmen who have spent the<br />\nlast six months wondering why they came to Hopkins<br />\n(or for all you upperclassmen who forgot somewhere<br />\nbetween CIP and Orgo Lab)the reason will become<br />\nquite clear on Saturday as the Orangemen of Syracuse<br />\ntake on YOUR Johns Hopkins Blue Jays, the defending national lacrosse champions.<br />\nAfter last year's cinderella season, the Blue Jays<br />\nare sitting on top of the lacrosse world. Yet, in the<br />\nforthcoming three months they will be heavily<br />\nchallenged by the likes of North Carolina, Maryland,<br />\nCornell and Syracuse. Without any further introduction, here are our picks, along with our expert<br />\nanalyses.<br />\n1. Johns Hopkins Blue Jays: Led by returning<br />\nstarters, such as attackman Mike Morrill (last year's<br />\nleading scorer), midfielder Brendan Kelly,<br />\ndefensemen Dave Pietramala, James De Tommaso,<br />\nand Greg Lilly, as well as goaltender Quint<br />\nKessinich, this team has an excellent opportunity to<br />\nrepeat championship performance. Leadership will<br />\nbe provided by seniors Eric Shaw and John Dressel,<br />\nas well as the starters. The team will be anchored<br />\nby a solid defense, led by All-Americans Pietramala<br />\nand Kessinich. Along with Morrill, the scoring load<br />\nwill be carried by John Ciccarone, Jeff Ihm, Scott<br />\nMarr and John Wilkins. At midfield veterans Pat<br />\nRussell, Greg Gunning, and Greg Kelly should prove<br />\nreliable. The best coaching staff in the nation will<br />\nalso look to a promising class of freshmen for additional support. Although the losses of Brian Wood,<br />\nCraig Bubier, Steve Mitchell, Larry LeDoyen and<br />\nBruce Chanenchuk are worthy of mention, this onehundred and fifth edition of the Blue Jays are our<br />\npicks to win their 43rd national championship.<br /><br />\n3. North Carolina Tar Heels: A team, which on<br />\npaper seems to be as athletically talented as Maryland, the Tar Heels will need to replace seven starters<br />\nfrom a year ago. This includes their entire starting defense, which was led by first team AllAmerican Tom Haus, as well as third team member<br />\nChris Walker. At least early in the season, this should<br />\nloom as a stumbling block. On the offensive front,<br />\nthe Heels are minus their two scoring leaders in the<br />\nSeivold brothers. However, the team will be very<br />\nstrong on attack with returning players with starting<br />\nexperience Chris Hein, Chris Galgano, Corey Gavitt,<br />\nJohn Szczypinski, and Mark Tununillo. Led by the<br />\nplay and leadership of the Welsh brothers, Brett<br />\nDavy and Ted Brown, the midfield positions will be<br />\nwell stocked. Also, the starting goalie Barney Aburn<br />\nreturns for another season in Chapel Hill. As Coach<br />\nZimmerman commented, \"They are loaded offensively . . .they will be another very good team.\"<br />\n4. Syracuse Orangemen: The Orangemen will<br />\nhave a large gap to fill with the loss at graduation<br />\nof two starting attackmen, as well as All-World midfielder Todd Curry. The scoring slack will be picked up by attaclunan John Zulberti, as well as the<br />\nCanadian Gait brothers at midfield, of whom Gary<br />\nGait is expected to be named All-American as a<br />\nsophomore. Defensively, they lost some starters, but<br />\ncapable replacements are ready to accept their roles<br />\nof responsibility. In goal will be Matt Palumb, who<br />\nsat out the end of last season with a knee injury, but<br />\nas a sophomore will be expected to perform at a high<br />\nlevel.<br /><br />\nttunow<br />\nt00%<br />\nktt,k,o<br /><br />\n2. Maryland Terrapins: All-Americans Brendal<br />\nHanley (a transfer from Hopkins) at attack and Tom<br />\nWorstell at midfield lead this year's squad. Gone are<br />\nHopkins killers Jim Beardmore, Kirk Thurston and<br />\nMike Mosko, but this year's team seems to be one<br />\nof the most athletically gifted in the country. Replacing the highly regarded Beardmore in goal will be<br />\nsenior Dennis Sullivan. The entire defensive crew<br />\nreturns, minus Brian Jackson, so scoring on the Terps<br />\nshould be a formidable task. Phil Williard and Guy<br />\nRicciardi return as valuable midfielders. Of interest<br />\ncould be the play of the transfer student Pat Gugerty at this position as well. Senior Mike Smith, as well<br />\nas Hanley will lead the Terps attack. Coach Zimmerman remarked about the 1988 Terps: \"They are<br />\na very talented team...looks again this year to be<br />\na contender.\"<br /><br />\nUSIA* Divis<br />\nPreseason Poll<br />\nRanking<br />\n1<br />\n2<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n7<br /><br />\nPOirtiS<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins (9)<br />\nMaryland (7)<br />\nNorth Carolina<br />\nCornell (1)<br />\nSyracuse<br />\nVirginia<br /><br />\n190<br /><br />\n175<br />\n152<br /><br />\nCourtesy of Syracuse University<br /><br />\n5. Cornell Big Red: Led by Player of the Year<br />\nTim Goldstein, the Big Red will look to repeat as<br />\nparticipants in this year's NCAA championship<br />\ngame. Along with Goldstein on attack will be senior<br />\nJohn Wurzburger and junior Steve \"the Stork\"<br />\nMeyer. This could be the highest scoring frontline<br />\nin college lacrosse. Some of their key midfielders,<br />\nin first and second team All-Americans Bob Cummings and Todd Francis respectively, from last year's<br />\nIvy champ team, have graduated, but capable players<br />\nawait. On defense, their fine trio of Tim Vivian,<br />\nAaron Jones and Steve Paletta departed in June, but<br />\ntheir goaltender, Paul Schimoler, returns in quest of<br />\nanother final four appearance. As Zimmerman stated,<br />\n\"They should once again be tough in '88.\"<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nthis point in the season, they will face tremendous<br />\ncompetition from other top-ranked teams, including<br />\nMaryland, Virginia, and Hopkins. Look for Navy<br />\nto have an uplifting early spring, and possibly, a long<br />\nrun in the NCAA's.<br />\n7. University of Massachusetts Minutemen: Led<br />\nby first team All-American Tom Carmean, the<br />\nMinutemen will look to establish themselves as contenders for the NCAA championship. Although many<br />\nlacrosse fans are unimpressed with most teams away<br />\nfrom the mid-Atlantic and New York regions, many<br />\nin Amherst believe this squad will be heard from in<br />\nthe spring. Besides Carmean, U Mass will rely on<br />\nthe exploits of goaltender Sal LoCascio, last year's<br />\nthird team All-American. Sources close to High<br />\nSchool Lacrosse have said that U Mass captured the<br />\nbest young attackmen from Long Island last year.<br />\nAlthough their schedule can't compare with those<br />\nof the traditional powers, the Minutemen should still<br />\nbe regarded as one of the top teams going into this<br />\nyear's season.<br />\n8. University of Virginia Cavaliers: Although at<br />\nthis point, coach Jim Adams picks his squad no<br />\nhigher than sixteenth, the Cavaliers will look to return<br />\nto the competitive level that marked their program<br />\nin the past. Even with last year's disappointment,<br />\nthere were signs that this was indeed a top flight program. Such was the case when Virginia invaded<br />\nHomewood and defeated the Jays last year. However,<br />\non the downside there was the shocker suffered at<br />\nthe hands of the Brown Bruins. Their only AllAmerican selection, defenseman Scott Lind, has<br />\ngraduated, so leadership will become a key for this<br />\nteam. At goal will be sophomore Stu Ridgely, who<br />\nwas exceptional last year in his substitute performance for Peter Sheehan here against Hopkins.<br />\nReturning as starters will be Greg Sessa and Chase<br />\nMonroe at attack, Tom Engelke and Andy Kraus at<br />\nmidfield, as well as Pete NC Sherry at defense. It will<br />\nbe quite surprising even to ..oach Adams, however,<br />\nif this unit advances far U. 'wards Memorial Day in<br />\nSyracuse.<br /><br />\n9. Brown University Bruins: After blossoming<br />\non the lacrosse scene last y..ar, especially with a hard<br />\nfought victory over Virgin a, this Ivy Leaguer will<br />\nlook to win more belie:.:rs as they attempt to<br />\nchallenge rival Cornell fol Ivy honors. Last year's<br />\nquick exit at the hands of avy in the first round of<br />\nthe NCAA's will provide incentive for this year's<br />\nedition. Since the core of last year's underdog team<br />\n6. Navy Midshipmen: Behind the leadership pro- returns to Providence, i ; experienced unit will<br />\nvided by five returning All-Americans, including top.. cause headaches to oppor its, Ivies and non-Ivies<br />\nscorers Paul Basile and Mike Herger, the seventy- alike.<br />\nninth edition of Navy Lacrosse will look to advance<br />\n10. Vacant: As of this writing, we can't come to<br />\nbeyond last year's NCAA defeat at the hands of the<br />\nSyracuse Orangemen. Among other standouts will agreement as to whether Army, Pennsylvania,<br />\nbe senior goalie Joe Donnelly, a two-time honorable Rutgers, Adelphi, or Towson belong as the final pick<br />\nmention All-American, midfielder Frank Snyder and to this illustrious poll.

The 11-10 victory over<br />\nCornell University in the final game marked the third<br />\ntime in four years that the Blue Jays under Coach<br />\nZimmerman have captured the title.<br />\nThe season started on an unhappy note when<br />\nHopkins lost an early March game in the Carrier<br />\nDome to Syracuse University, 15-14, The following week, the Jays travelled to Rutgers where senior<br />\nmidfielder Larry LeDoyen sparked the Blue Jays in<br />\nthe fourth quarter to help seal a 10-7 win.<br />\nPlaying at Homewood for the next two Saturdays,<br />\nHopkins completely dominated Washington College<br />\n23-7, and Princeton University 21-6. At this point<br />\nmany felt that the 1987 Jays had finally hit their<br />\nstride. But the next Saturday, Virginia invaded<br />\nHomewood and pulled a surprise upset over the Jays<br />\nby the score of 9-7. This was the poorest performance<br />\nby a Hopkim team in the last four years and skeptics began to question the destiny of the '87 squad.<br />\nTo say the Jays had their backs against the wall<br />\nis an understatement. On the following Saturday,<br />\nHopkins had to travel to Chapel Hill to face the defending national champion Tar Heels of the University<br />\nof North Carolina. And to make matters even worse,<br />\nHopkins had never defeated Carolina on their home<br />\nturf.<br />\nTo shake things up quite a bit, Coach Zimmerman decided to start freshman goalkeeper Quint<br />\nKessenich against North Carolina. Many felt that this<br />\nwas throwing the lamb to the wolves\u2014starting a<br />\nfreshman against the defending national champion.<br />\nBut Kessenich had shown flashes of brilliance during practice and the coaching staff was confident of<br />\nhis abilities.<br />\nThe game turned out to be a thriller. Tied at the<br />\nhalf, Carolina jumped to a two goal lead late in the<br />\nthird period. Things looked bad for the Jays until<br />\nLarry LeDoyen took control. Displaying the talent<br />\nthat many knew he had, Larry led the Jays to a comefrom-behind 11-10 victory. Kessenich proved he was<br />\na future star by making 21 saves in the nets.<br />\nThe following Saturday a tough 11-9 victory over<br /><br />\nArmy set up the big game\u2014Hopkins versus<br />\nundefeated and top-ranked University of Maryland<br />\nat College Park. Before more than 20,000 fans,<br />\nHopkins stayed with the Terps for three quarters,<br />\nwhich no other team in the country had managed to<br />\ndo. But in the deciding fourth period. Maryland<br />\noutscored the Jays 4-0 to take an 11-7 victory. It was<br />\na tough loss for the Jays, but hopes were high that<br />\nthese two squads might meet again in the playoffs.<br />\nHopkins returned to Baltimore with an umimpressive 10-9 Homecoming win over Navy. The<br />\nMidshipmen had roared back to almost tie the score<br />\nlate in the fourth period.<br />\nWith a 6 and 3 record, the Blue Jays were scheduled to close the regular season on the following Saturday night against a hungry Towson State squad at<br />\nTiger Stadium. Many felt that this would be the year<br />\nfor Towson to beat Johns Hopkins for the first time,<br />\nbut Hopkins, playing the most consistent lacrosse of<br />\nthe season, handed Towson a convincing defeat. It<br />\nappeared that perhpas the Blue Jays were finally hitting their peak going into the all-important playoffs.<br />\nRanked fourth in the twelve team tournament,<br />\nHopkins hosted fifth-ranked North Carolina in a<br />\nrematch that would determine who would go to the<br />\nFinal Four at Rutgers University. Following the usual<br />\nscenario when these two teams meet, the contest was<br />\nhard fought all the way. Late in the game Carolina<br />\ntook a one goal lead after being down by two. after<br />\nsophomore middie Brendan Kelly tied the score with<br />\n2:30 to play, the defense cleared the ball to Mike Morrill, who scored his sixth goal of the game to give<br />\nHopkins the lead and an 11-10 win. This was perhaps<br />\nMorrill's finest day as a Blue Jay. Kessenich was<br />\nagain tough in the goal, coming up with 23 saves,<br />\nseveral at point-blank range.<br />\nThe win over North Carolina gave Hopkins<br />\nmomentum going into the Final Four, something they<br />\nwould surely need because they would be facing stillundefeated Maryland in the semi-finals. It had been<br />\nsaid that the 1987 Terp team might be the best ever<br />\nfielded at Maryland, and Coach Zimmerman and his<br />\nstaff knew that it would take an almost-perfect game<br />\nto upset the number one ranked Terrapins.

/>\nA newcomer's guide to the rules of the game<br />\ning, slashing, crosse-checking, tripping, unnecessary<br />\nroughness, unsportsmanlike conduct, and the use of<br />\nan illegal crosse. Watch for these to see just what<br />\nthey are. There is a lot of subjectivity in the calling<br />\nof these fouls\u2014it depends mostly on the mood of the<br />\nreferees. The penalty for a personal foul is suspension from the game for one to three minutes, depending on the severity of the foul. The offender's team<br />\nplays short-handed during the penalty.<br />\n*Expulsion fouls: A player will be suspended for<br />\nthe remainder of the game for really nasty attempts<br />\nto injure or for committing five personal fouls.<br />\nHowever, the penalized team is allowed to substitute<br />\nfor the expelled player.<br />\n*Technical fouls: These are less serious fouls and<br />\nother rules violations. These include interference,<br />\nillegal screening, holding, pushing, touching the ball<br />\nwith the hands, withholding the ball from play,<br />\nthrowing the crosse, illegal procedure (a very broad<br />\ncategory, indeed), stalling, illegal equipment, and<br />\ncrease violations. The penalty for a technical foul<br />\nis either a 30-second penalty (if the offending team<br />\ndoes not have possession of the ball at the time the<br />\nfoul is committed) or simply loss of possession of<br />\nthe ball (if the offending team does have possession.)<br />\n*Penalty enforcement: A penalized player will<br />\nremain off the field (and his team plays one man<br />\ndown)for the duration of the penalty time unless the<br />\nother team scores a goal or the penalized team gains<br />\npossession of the ball in its attack goal area.<br />\n*Out of bounds: When the ball is thrown out of<br />\nbounds by one team, possession is awarded to the<br />\nother team, unless the ball was deemed a shot-ongoal that went out-of-bounds. In this case, possession is awarded to the team, one of whose in-bounds<br />\nplayers was closest to the ball when it crossed the<br />\nboundary line.<br />\n*Crease Privileges:No opposing player is allowed<br />\nin the goal crease area at any time. They may reach<br />\ninto the crease with their sticks to play a loose ball,<br />\nas long as they don't make contact with the goalie<br />\nor his stick. Furthermore, a defending player, including the goalkeeper, with the ball in his possession, may not enter the goal-crease area. Nor may<br />\nhe remain in the goal-crease area in possession of<br />\nthe ball longer than four seconds.<br />\n*Time-outs: Each team is allowed to call two<br />\ntimeouts per half and one per each sudden-death<br />\nperiod. Timeouts can be called when the ball is dead<br />\nby either team or by the team with the possession<br />\nof the ball in the attacking half of the field. The coach<br />\nor the captain of the team can call a timeout.<br />\nWel!, there you have some of the basic rules of<br />\nthe game of lacrosse. Some of them may seem sort<br />\nof strange to those of you who are new to the sport,<br />\nbut after you see a few games, you'll get the hang<br />\nof it and even start second guessing the refs (who<br />\nare almost never right, anyway).<br /><br />\nby Glen Weiss<br />\nAlthough it may at first look like a totally foreign<br />\nsport to those of you who are used to baseball, football, basketball, and hockey, lacrosse is a fairly simple game that, armed with the knowledge of a few<br />\nbasic rules, anyone can understand and enjoy. If<br />\nyou've never actually seen a lacrosse game, there<br />\nare a few rules that should become readily apparent<br />\nto you tomorrow at Homewood field; on the other<br />\nhand, there are also a few rules which might baffle<br />\nyou.<br />\nFirst the easy stuff:<br />\n*Each team consists of ten players on the field at<br />\nany one time, barring penalties, of course. These<br />\nplayers are trying to score goals by carrying, throwing or batting the ball with the crosse (stick) in an<br />\nattempt to put the ball into the opponent's net.<br />\n*The ten players are arranged in different position on the field: three attackrnen, who play almost<br />\nexclusively in the attack half of the field; three<br />\ndefensemen, who play almost exclusively in the<br />\ndefensive half of the field, and one goalkeeper, who<br />\nplays almost exclusively in front of his net.<br />\n*The game is 60 official game-minutes in length,<br />\ndivided into four 15-minute quarters. There is a twominute time-out between the first and second periods<br />\nand the third and fourth periods, and a halftime of<br />\nat least ten minutes. In the event of a tie score at the<br />\nend of the fourth period, successive four-minute sudden death periods are played until a team scores.<br />\n*Play begins with a face-off at the center of the<br />\nfield. The two face-off men line up on opposite sides<br />\nof the center line, while the goalkeeper and three<br />\nother players are confined to the defensive goal area,<br />\nthree players are confined to the attack goal area,<br />\nand one player remains in each of the wing areas (see<br />\nfield diagram). When the whistle blows, the faceoff men battle for the ball, while the players in the<br />\nwing areas are released, but the other players must<br />\nremain in the goal areas until a player on either team<br />\nhas gained possession of the ball, the ball goes out<br />\nof bounds, or the ball crosses into the goal area.<br />\nNow for the less obvious rules:<br />\n\u2022Offsides: A team is considered offside when<br />\neither it has fewer than three men in its attack half<br />\nof the field or it has fewer than four men in its defensive half of the field. When one team is offside, a<br />\ntechnical penalty is called against that team (see<br />\nbelow).<br />\n*Legal player actions: \"Bodychecking\" of an opponent in possession of the ball or within five yards<br />\nof a loose ball, from the front or side above the knees<br />\nand below the neck, is legal. A player may check<br />\nhis opponent's crosse with his own crosse when the<br />\nopponent has control of the ball or is within five yards<br />\nof a loose ball or when the ball is in flight within<br />\nfive yards of the player.<br />\n*Personal fouls: These include illegal bodycheck-<br /><br />\nOfficial's Signals<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\n3<br />\nOFFSIDE<br /><br />\nNO SCORE<br /><br />\nSCORE<br /><br />\nTIMEOUT<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\n\u2022,_<br />\nSLASHING<br /><br />\nTECHNICAL FOUL<br /><br />\nILLEGALLY TOUCHING THE BAL.<br /><br />\n(<br />\n4<br />\n1<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nRaiff<br /><br />\nBRUSH OFT<br /><br />\nOUT OF BOUNDS DIRECTION OF PLAY<br /><br />\nSTALLING<br />\nIsee nolei<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nGET IT IN<br />\nKEEP IT IN<br /><br />\n1111GALIT IN CREASE<br />\nMOUSE INFRACTION<br /><br />\nDELAY Of GONE<br /><br />\nNote Fze stalling point SI player and then in chretbon hall should go<br /><br />\nIS<br /><br />\n15<br /><br />\nPICK OFF<br /><br />\nHOLDING<br /><br />\n18<br />\nPUSHING<br /><br />\nBALI IN POSSESSION ON FICE4IFF<br /><br />\nThe Lacrosse Field of Play<br /><br />\nUNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS<br /><br />\nLINE<br /><br />\nSIDE<br />\nHO YDS<br />\n,00 58-<br /><br />\nWING<br /><br />\nAREA<br />\n2\" \u2022\u2014\u202221<br /><br />\n-\u2022<br /><br />\n15 YDS<br />\nI , 3 72'<br /><br />\n40<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n40<br /><br />\nYDS<br /><br />\nYDS<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\nSODS<br />\nUNSPORTSMIALLKE CONDUCT<br />\nBLOCIoNG BELOW THE KNEES TRIPPING<br /><br />\n6'<br /><br />\n85-)<br /><br />\nGOAL<br />\nAREA<br /><br />\n4<br />\nvs<br />\nCI<br />\na- a<br />\n0\"<br /><br />\nRADIUS<br /><br />\n10 Y DS<br /><br />\n1 9 14,3<br /><br />\nWING<br />\nSPECIAL<br /><br />\nFROIA THE REAR<br /><br />\nGOAL<br />\nAREA<br /><br />\nSUBSTITUTION<br /><br />\n10 YDS<br />\n-<br /><br />\n14,1<br /><br />\nAREA<br /><br />\n,-_-<br /><br />\nAREA<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nCOACHES<br />\nl'(,yDs-....i<br />\n(5 44,1<br />\n5 YDS' AREA<br />\niI45N,.<br />\nTABLE AREA<br />\n1\u2014<br />\ne'llr<br />\n1::\"-----1<br />\n5YDS<br />\n.3 YDS<br />\n4<br />\ni<br />\nTIMERS TABL<br />\n1-/ \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014BENCH AREAS<br /><br />\nI<br />\nC OAARCEHAE<br /><br />\nSIDE LINE<br />\nI 6 y<br /><br />\nn<br />\nCROSSE CHELAING<br /><br />\n14 / MARCH 4, 1988<br /><br />\nSimmons interview reveals his hopes for Orange<br />\nRoy Simmons Jr., the head coach of the Syracuse<br />\nlacrosse team, spoke with Patrick Furey ofthe NewsLetter on February 26th. We thank Coach Simmons<br />\nfor his time and his help with our coverage of the<br />\nOrangemen.<br />\nN-L: Your success in the Carrier Dome in the past<br />\nhas been phenomenal. Do you feel this gives you an<br />\nadvantage going into this season, being that the<br />\nNCAA Final Four will be held at Syracuse?<br />\nSimmons: Well, I think we're probably called a<br />\nsynthetic surface team in that we play transition ball,<br />\nand if we're in a free game, that's the way we like<br />\nit. I think if anybody, like any armchair quarterbacks,<br />\nfound a problem with us, it was at Delaware and<br /><br />\nI think that if we have any<br />\nweaknesses, it's that we're going to give up some goals.<br />\nBrown, where we were forced to play on a dirt field<br />\nwhich slowed us down a bit and made the groundballs a little inconsistent. So, we obviously like playing here [at the Carrier Dome] because of the surface.<br />\nN-L: You've been extremely successful against<br />\nHopkins the past two years. To what do you attribute<br />\nthis success, and how do you see the game this year?<br /><br />\nwire. We played North Carolina in our opening<br />\nbasketball game this season, and they had a similar<br />\nsituation with J.R. Reid. All I think it did was make<br />\nSimmons: Last year we were not unlike Hopkins, the team reach down and get a little bit tougher, and<br />\nin that we both held sensational freshmen. We had they came forward and made up the difference. I<br />\nhoped not to use Matt Palumb just like Hopkins pro- think psychologically the Jays are strong enough to<br />\nbably hoped not to use Quint Kessenich. But we both<br />\nlimped along, and I know the Jays dropped three ball I really don't think we're going<br />\ngames before they put Quint in the game, and then<br />\nthey never lost another one and won the title. We to beat anybody; I think we're<br />\nwere very similar in that we were a little sketchy in going to outscore some people.<br />\nthe goal with our senior goalie. So we put in Matt<br />\nPalumb, who we feel is every bit as good as Quint,<br />\nand he had two very solid games against Army and play with or without Quint in the game.

The Jays, on the other<br />\nhand, put Quint in as a freshman, and he picked you to play, and if so, why?<br />\nup and enabled you to go on and win the title.<br />\nSimmons: I think it's always a tough place to play<br />\nSo I think this year it will be a great battle again<br />\nbecause<br />\nthere's a great spirit and a great tradition<br />\nstarting<br />\nin the goal with Syracuse and Hopkins both<br />\nthere.<br />\nIt's<br />\nnot only playing at the Hall of Fame and<br />\ngot<br />\ntwo<br />\nour<br />\nboy<br />\nonly<br />\nUnfortunately,<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nat<br />\nHomewood,<br />\nQuint<br />\ngot<br />\nbut it's the home opener and probably<br />\ninjury,<br />\nwhile<br />\nhad<br />\nan<br />\nand<br />\nthen<br />\ngames in<br />\nthe<br />\ngame<br />\nof<br />\nthe<br />\nweek.

I know we'll have a good<br />\nKessenich, and if so how do you feel it will affect the crowd because it's lacrosse and spring is here. Yes,<br />\nit's a difficult place to play, but we enjoy the opporoutcome of the game?<br />\nN-L: How do things look for you on defense,<br />\nespecially at goalie'?<br /><br />\nSimmons: Yes, I heard about that through an AP<br />\nSimmons: Well, I think it's always going to be<br />\na close game, but it's not the greatest lacrosse game<br />\nin the world because it's the first game of the year.<br />\nI think both teams will be trying to feel the other out.<br />\nI think you'll see a lot of teams right now who are<br />\nexperimenting with freshmen and sophomores and<br />\ntrying to get over graduation losses from the year<br />\nbefore. Both teams will probably play a slowdown<br />\ntype of ball game trying to get a game plan together.<br />\nI think if we would meet sometime in the middle of<br />\nthe year it would be a far more exciting game for<br />\nthe spectators.The last two games have been one goal<br />\nball games, so typically they have been very exciting,<br />\nbut in reality there is better lacrosse played in midyear and toward the end when Hopkins seems to get<br />\na little better.<br />\nN-L: You lost some pretty key players to graduation, for instance Todd Curry, Rhett Cavanaugh, and<br />\nTom Nelson. Do you feel that graduation has hurt<br />\nyour squad, or do feel you have the personnel and<br />\nrecruits to replace them?<br />\nSimmons: Well, it's the nature of amateur athletics<br />\nthat when four years rolls around you're going to<br />\nmiss your Bubiers, your Dressels, and your Woods,<br />\nand that's something you have to learn to live with.<br />\nWe lost Nelson and Bates, who were two of our three<br />\nstarting attack, and we lost Curry and Cavanaugh,<br />\nwho were a big part of our mid-field. We also lost<br />\na kid named O'Donnell, who started for four years<br />\non defense. Players like that are always very difficult<br />\nto replace. But we had a lot of young kids last year<br />\nwho got some playing time in important games, and<br />\nI don't think that, if they start the Hopkins game this<br />\nyear, it will be a rude awakening for them.<br />\nN-L: You've always had a very strong attack. Do<br />\nyou feel that you have the personnel this season to<br />\nscore as much as you have in the past?<br />\nSimmons: I really don't think that we are going<br />\nto beat anybody; I think we're going to outscore some<br />\npeople. Unfortunately, that's kind of been our<br />\nhallmark the last few years. We get a lot of goals,<br />\nand if we get enough we can win. In the semifinals<br />\nlast year, we scored 15 goals and lost. That kind of<br />\ngoal production should be enough to win you ball<br />\ngames. Last year we beat Hobart 20-15 in what was<br />\nreally a scoring duel and not a very defensive battle. I think if we have any weakness it's that we're<br />\ngoing to give up some goals, but I think our firepower<br />\nis still strong even though we've graduated some<br />\ngood sticks.<br /><br />\nSee SIMMONS, 15<br /><br />\n1988 Syracuse Univ.

Being the host school is nice, but Coach Roy Simmons,<br />\nJr. would like nothing more than to be the host team<br />\nfor the Memorial Day weekend festivities.<br />\nSyracuse has been to the semifinals each of the past<br />\nfive seasons, the second longest run of success in<br />\nthe country behind Johns Hopkins. During that time<br />\nthe Orangemen have played in the championship<br />\ngame three times and won a national title. Would<br />\na sixth straight berth in the semis and the chance to<br />\nplay at home for the championship appeal to Simmons? Syracuse has an all-time Carrier Dome record<br />\nof 40 wins and 3 losses and has won 36 of its last<br />\n37 there. The Orangemen also have a 9-0 record at<br />\nhome in the NCAA playoffs, 8-0 in the Dome.<br />\nSyracuse is coming off of a somewhat disappointing 9-4 season. Such is the nature of Syracuse<br />\nlacrosse in the '80s, that a number 3 national ranking and a trip to the national semifinals could be<br />\ndisappointing. Expectations for the Orange are a split<br />\n(at least) in the early season games with Hopkins and<br />\nNorth Carolina and then a clean sweep through the<br />\nrest of the regular season.<br />\nLast season started out that way. The Orange opened the season at home by beating Hopkins 15-14 in<br />\nfront of a Carrier Dome crowd of 11,198. Hopkins<br />\nwould go on to win the national title. SU took to the<br />\nroad and dropped a 13-11 verdict to the defending<br />\nnational champions, the North Carolina Tar Heels.<br />\nThe clean sweep never materialized, however, as SU<br />\nbeat Cortland but stumbled to a 19-9 loss against<br />\nAdelphi.<br />\nFollowing grass field road wins over Army and<br />\nBrown (mud in the latter case), the Orangemen<br />\nreturned to the friendly confines of the Carrier Dome<br />\nfor a showdown with undefeated Cornell. The Big<br />\nRed, fielding its best team in a decade, blitzed SU<br />\n19-6 to end the Orangemen's 36 game home winning streak. At 4-3, and falling in the rankings,<br />\nSyracuse could have packed it in. Instead the Orange<br />\nput it all together and started plaiying its most inspired lacrosse of the season.<br />\nIt began with a 20-15 shelling of Division III champion Hobart, a win that gave SU the Krause-Simmons<br />\nTrophy. From there the Orange belted Rutgers 17-5,<br />\nheld off Penn 12-10 and stormed U Mass 17-11 to<br />\nfinish the regular season 8-3.<br />\nThe late season play of the Orange earned them<br />\nthe third seed in the NCAA playoffs and a bye in<br /><br />\nSimmons: on lax<br />\nSIMMONS, from 14<br />\ntunity. We weren't on a year to year basis with<br />\nHopkins until 1984, and we were fortunate that we<br />\nwere able to get on the schedule. I think this game<br />\nis important for lacrosse, and it's a pleasure for us<br />\nto come to the Hall of Fame. There's only four or<br />\nfive schools in the entire year that have that opportunity, and we have that opportunity and realize how<br />\nfortunate we are.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel there is parity in college lacrosse<br />\ntoday?<br />\nSimmons: No, not really. You have to go back<br />\nand look at the record and look at the 80's. Hopkins<br />\nand Syracuse are the only two teams that have been<br />\nfive straight years at the sight of the championships.<br />\nThe others have been Carolina, Virginia, and<br />\nMaryland. Every now and then you have someone<br />\nelse come on the scene, like now Cornell is sneaking back in. Lately, they've expanded the tournament to try to make it more alluring, but the strength<br />\nstill lies with seven or eight teams in the east. I think<br />\nthe sleepers this year will be U. Mass and Adelphi,<br />\nbut year in and year out the same perennial powers<br />\nsurface. We just hope that we can keep our heads<br />\nup and stay in the ball game.

The red-hot Orangemen trounced the<br />\nMiddies 19-5, earning a return trip to the NCAA<br />\nsemis and a rematch with Cornell in the process.<br />\nThe scene was a much different one from the two<br />\nteams' earlier meeting in the Dome. Syracuse hung<br />\ntough with the Big Red all day and actually had leads<br />\nof 6-4 and 11-10. After falling behind 15-12, the<br />\nOrange came back behind two Gary Gait goals to<br />\ntie it up. With the momentum apparently shifting to<br />\nSyracuse, Cornell coach Richie Moran called for a<br />\nstick check on Gait. The stick proved to be legal,<br />\nbut the stoppage in play seemed to take the steam<br />\nout of the Orange. Cornell scored three unanswered<br />\ngoals and the Syracuse season was over, 18-15. Cornell went on to lose the championship game to Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nKey losses from last year's SU squad include twotime first team All-American midfielder Todd Curry,<br />\nmidfielder Rhett Cavanaugh (third team AllAmerican), defenseman Dan Pratt (honorable mention All-American), goalie Jim Gyory (a 1986 AllAmerican), and attackmen Gordie Mapes and Tom<br />\nNelson, one of the leading scorers in SU history.<br />\nBut Simmons' cupboard is not bare. Not by a long<br />\nshot. Returning for SU are attackman John Zulberti<br />\n(second team All-American), the team's second<br />\nleading scorer last season with 24 goals and 22<br />\nassists, the twin duo of Paul and Gary Gait, who as<br />\nfreshman combined for 36 goals, and sophomore<br />\ngoalie Matt Palumb, who earned the starting job midway through last season only to go down<br />\nwith an injury.<br />\nWhat is the outlook for a return trip to the championships? Despite the loss of 14 seniors from last<br />\nyear's squad, Syracuse is a good bet to make a run<br />\nin the NCAA playoffs. The SU midfield is as big<br />\nand talented as any in the country and the defense<br />\nis improved over last season. The attack will be<br />\nyoung, but if Zulberti is healthy look for him to ring<br />\nup some big numbers. The net should be in good<br />\nhands with Palumb, who showed what he is capable<br />\nof in impressive wins over Army and Brown last<br />\nseason.<br />\nSU will have to make up for the loss of Todd Curry<br />\nand attackmen Nelson and Mapes. But the '87<br />\nOrangemen had to overcome the loss of Orange goalking Tom Korrie and the '86 Orange had to compensate for the loss of all-time NCAA scoring leader<br />\nTim Nelson. Invariably, great programs have to<br />\nreplace great players. 1988 will not be any different.<br />\nHere is a look at the 1988 Orangemen:<br /><br />\nAttack<br />\nThe name to remember on attack is John Zulberti. Zulberti had a blood clot in his arm last year in<br />\nthe pre-season, which hampered him in the early<br />\ngames. He finished strong and should be ready for<br />\nhis best season yet. Zulberti scored 24 goals and 22<br />\nassists last year and already has 57 goals and 63<br />\nassists for his career. Simmons says that Zulberti is<br />\n\"disruptive\" to a defense and cannot be contained<br />\none-on-one. Probable starters along side Zulberti are<br />\nsophomores Greg Burns (9-4-13) and Jim Egan<br />\n(5-1-6), who proved as freshmen they were capable<br />\nof making the big play.<br />\nMidfield<br />\nWith Rutgers transfer Brad Roos joining the Gait<br />\ntwins, SU has a formidable midfield. All three are<br />\nin the area of 6-2, 195 and all have good speed. Roos<br />\nearned All-American honors as a junior with the<br />\nScarlet Knights. Gary Gait was an honorable mention All-American last year, as well as a member of<br />\nthe NCAA All-Tournament team.

Most recently, he served as a defensive coach<br />\nfor the Jays.<br />\n- After three years as Coach Zimmerman's top assistant, Bill Tierney has left Hopkins to become head<br />\ncoach at Princeton. \"It was time for him to move<br />\non,\" commented Zimmerman, \"Princeton got a<br />\ngood man.\" Zimmerman predicts that Tierney can<br />\nmake the Tigers, currently one of the weaker Ivy<br />\nLeague teams, into one good enough to qualify for<br />\nthe NCAA tournament in two to four years.<br />\nLast summer, Coach Zimmerman along with<br />\ngraduated seniors Craig Bubier, Stuart Jones, Steve<br />\nMitchell, and Brian Wood,traveled to Japan for three<br />\nweeks to promote the sport of lacrosse in that country. The group held clinics and daily workouts. Zimmerman was very pleased with the trip and said that<br />\nthe Japanese have \"the potential to pick it [lacrosse]<br />\nup and do very well in it.\" He was encouraged by<br />\nthe sport's \"good backing in Japan\" and by the belief<br />\namong many Japanese lacrosse enthusiasts that the<br />\nnation \"can be succesful in international competition.\" Next summer, a group from the Keio University will spend a week at Homewood participating<br />\nin a clinic run by the Hopkins lacrosse staff.<br />\nAs lacrosse grows internationally, especially in an<br />\nOlympic year such as this, one cannot help but<br />\nwonder if the sport will ever return to the Summer<br />\nGames. In 1928 and 1932, lacrosse was an Olympic sport. Both years, the United States was<br />\nrepresented by a team from Hopkins. The first year<br />\nthe team tied for first place, the second it won.<br />\n\"Lacrosse has not much of a future in the real Olympics,\" says Coach Zimmerman.

This international competition,<br />\nwhich took place at Hopkins in 1982, involves<br />\nCanada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the<br />\nUnited States. Zimmerman served as an assistant<br />\ncoach of the United States team in 1986, and as an<br />\nalternate player in 1982.<br />\nOn the current state of international lacrosse,<br />\nCoach Zimmerman acknowledges the United States<br />\nas the dominant nation. He explains that the U.S.<br />\n\"has the total concept\" of the sport, with a \"settled<br />\nteam offense and defense\" similar to that used in<br />\nbasketball, and that the rest of the world's lacrosse<br />\nplaying countries have not yet reached this level of<br />\nplay.<br />\nNot all of the United States has achieved this \"total<br />\nconcept\" of lacrosse. In fact, Coach Zimmerman<br />\nbelieves that lacrosse west of the Appalachians is at<br />\na level considerably below that of Eastern lacrosse.<br />\nOf the West and Midwest, Zimmerman says,<br />\n\"They've just begun the game. The further west you<br />\ngo, the lower the level,\" he adds. He does, however,<br />\nsee progress in the lacrosse played in those regions.<br />\nIn the fall of 1988, the Hopkins lacrosse team will<br />\nhelp promote lacrosse west of the Mississippi by<br />\ntraveling to Michigan to play an exhibition against<br />\nthe Michigan State University lacrosse team.
