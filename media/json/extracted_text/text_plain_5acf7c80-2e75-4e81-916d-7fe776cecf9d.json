It seems that some<br />\nweeks ago a few members of the<br />\ndebating team took a trip to a nearby<br />\nuniversity to engage in a forensic<br />\ncontest of an extremely formal nature and that one of the members<br />\ncame home without his pants.<br />\nAnd that needs a little elucidating!<br />\nIt happened that after the debate,<br />\nwhich took place in tuxedos, the<br />\nHopkins men decided that they<br />\nwould not change back to their street<br />\nclothes, but that they would drive<br />\nhome in their formal doo-dads. And<br />\nso each and every one of them piled<br />\ntheir clothes into their respective<br />\nsuitcases and jumped into the auto<br />\nand away they went. They arrived<br />\nback in Baltimore and the fated<br />\nhero of this drama climbed the<br />\nsteps to his house.<br />\nHe put his<br />\nhands in his pocket for his keys and<br />\nsuddenly discovered that they had<br />\nbeen left in his other trousers. Then<br />\nbegan a frantic rummaging for the<br />\nkeys with the result that the poor<br />\nfellow realized that he had left his<br />\npantaloons back at the place of his<br />\nmighty endeavor.<br />\nAnd that is why a certain oratorically inclined student had to ask<br />\nfor his mail from the postoffice for<br />\na few days following.<br />\n<br />\n\"Wide Freedom\"\u2014Weyforth<br />\n<br />\nbr.

The<br />\nmembership has been cut to about<br />\nsixty men who regularly contribute<br />\nin one way or another to the concerts.<br />\n<br />\nWhy We Object To The<br />\nPresent Athletic Administration<br />\nIN THE rush of the sudden attack upon the athletic situation which<br />\nhas been carried on during the last few weeks it is quite possible that<br />\nmany of our readers are not altogether sure of the actual points upon<br />\nwhich we base our criticism of the present athletic administration. The<br />\neditors of THE NEWS-LETTER therefore (joining forces with Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa in an effort to secure reform), subjoin these specific and<br />\nuncamouflaged objections:<br />\nIN FOOTBALL:<br />\n1.\u2014The equipment for the team during the past year was inadequate<br />\nin quantity and quality to protect the team and to allow the best exploitation of the athletic talent which we had. Many men were discouraged<br />\nfrom trying out for the team because of lack of equipment for substitutes.<br />\nIn conjunction with this, it is worthy of note that $850 was appropriated<br />\nfor equipment purchase and the entire amount was available, according<br />\nto President Ames; yet only $555 was actually spent for equipment.<br />\n2.\u2014Furthermore,the weakest part of our team this year was the line;<br />\nyet a line coach of outstanding merit was fired before the season began,<br />\nthe excuse being that his four-hundred-dollar salary was too much.<br />\n3.\u2014Although a training table costs only $400 and the amount saved<br />\non equipment alone was nearly $300, the team was not kept at training<br />\ntable this year. The excuse, said the athletic authorities: Dr. Ames's<br />\norder. Dr. Ames said that he was not responsible for the order to discontinue the table.<br />\nIN BASKETBALL:<br />\nNo new uniforms have been bought for four years; the ones worn<br />\nnow were given by a friend of the University in 1931. The budget, with<br />\na deficit of $400, was approved, meaning that the Board of Trustees<br />\nwould approve the deficit. With all the obvious need for equipment,<br />\n$40 of the appropriation was not spent.<br />\nIN LACROSSE:<br />\nAn equipment situation practically identical with that of the football<br />\nsquad prevails herein also. The services of Gardner Mallonee as assistant coach were dispensed with here, to the handicap of the team.<br />\nIN SWIMMING:<br />\nFifty men came out for the squad, representing a wide student interest and the payment of $500 in athletic fees. Appropriation for the<br />\nteam. $132; this to cover all traveling expenses, rental of pool, equipment, etc. In order to make up the deficit here, each man has to pay $3<br />\nswimming charge, plus rental of a towel and locker for each practice,<br />\nthe aggregate of which amounts to practically another five dollars per man.<br />\nIN TRACK:<br />\nWe are faced here with the surprising situation of an approved<br />\nbudget allowing the team to spend $285 more than its gate receipts last<br />\nseason; and of only $150 of this having been spent. Still, the money was<br />\nso \"scarce\" that the team members had to pay their own expenses in<br />\nentering the South Atlantic meet and for one of the out-of-town trips.<br />\nThis, with $135 available in the treasury; and the track equipment is nowhere near adequate.<br />\nThe objections are concrete and based on fact, of which witness the<br />\naffirmation of the prominent athletes and campus leaders who sign their<br />\nnames herewith. But to continue:<br />\nTHE SCHEDULING of the games is a disgrace to the Hopkins.<br />\nWhenever we play any team beyond a third-rating in football or basketball we are notoriously a set-up, a pushover, or what have you. It's not<br />\nso bad losing if we play in our own class and without so much risk attached. But it is certainly bad for the morale of a team to know that<br />\nbefore it even begins a game it is universally recognized, even by the<br />\ncoaches, that defeat will be the outcome.<br />\nWE ARE AFRAID that if the Board of Trustees fails to approve<br />\nthe budget proposed this year, having- a three-thousand-dollar deficit<br />\nplanned for, that the place where economies will be made will be in the<br />\nmatter of equipment and traveling facilities for the teams, as we have<br />\nshown to have been the case last year.<br />\nWE BELIEVE the present administration has given convincing<br />\nevidence of inefficiency and blindness to the abuses around it. And we<br />\nare convinced that if conditions do not improve immediately that intercollegiate athletics will deteriorate to the point of abolition. In a sincere effort to avoid this state of affairs, the editors of THE NEWSLETTER and the members of Omicron Delta Kappa call for an accounting<br />\non the part of the administration and believe that nothing short of a<br />\nshake-up in personnel efficiency and organization, will answer this<br />\nproblem.<br />\n<br />\n50th Anniversary Program<br />\n<br />\nExtensive arrangements are under way in connection with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary<br />\nof the club, the program for which<br />\nwill be given at the annual home<br />\nconcert on February 23.<br />\nThe poster contest which was recently announced is getting under<br />\nway. A prize of five dollars will<br />\nbe offered for the best poster advertising the home concert. The judges<br />\nfor the contest are R. J.

The<br />\neditors of THE NEWS-LETTER therefore (joining forces with Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa in an effort to secure reform), subjoin these specific and<br />\nuncamouflaged objections:<br />\nIN FOOTBALL:<br />\n1.\u2014The equipment for the team during the past year was inadequate<br />\nin quantity and quality to protect the team and to allow the best exploitation of the athletic talent which we had. Many men were discouraged<br />\nfrom trying out for the team because of lack of equipment for substitutes.<br />\nIn conjunction with this, it is worthy of note that $850 was appropriated<br />\nfor equipment purchase and the entire amount was available, according<br />\nto President Ames; yet only $555 was actually spent for equipment.<br />\n2.\u2014Furthermore,the weakest part of our team this year was the line;<br />\nyet a line coach of outstanding merit was fired before the season began,<br />\nthe excuse being that his four-hundred-dollar salary was too much.<br />\n3.\u2014Although a training table costs only $400 and the amount saved<br />\non equipment alone was nearly $300, the team was not kept at training<br />\ntable this year. The excuse, said the athletic authorities: Dr. Ames's<br />\norder. Dr. Ames said that he was not responsible for the order to discontinue the table.<br />\nIN BASKETBALL:<br />\nNo new uniforms have been bought for four years; the ones worn<br />\nnow were given by a friend of the University in 1931. The budget, with<br />\na deficit of $400, was approved, meaning that the Board of Trustees<br />\nwould approve the deficit. With all the obvious need for equipment,<br />\n$40 of the appropriation was not spent.<br />\nIN LACROSSE:<br />\nAn equipment situation practically identical with that of the football<br />\nsquad prevails herein also. The services of Gardner Mallonee as assistant coach were dispensed with here, to the handicap of the team.<br />\nIN SWIMMING:<br />\nFifty men came out for the squad, representing a wide student interest and the payment of $500 in athletic fees. Appropriation for the<br />\nteam. $132; this to cover all traveling expenses, rental of pool, equipment, etc. In order to make up the deficit here, each man has to pay $3<br />\nswimming charge, plus rental of a towel and locker for each practice,<br />\nthe aggregate of which amounts to practically another five dollars per man.<br />\nIN TRACK:<br />\nWe are faced here with the surprising situation of an approved<br />\nbudget allowing the team to spend $285 more than its gate receipts last<br />\nseason; and of only $150 of this having been spent. Still, the money was<br />\nso \"scarce\" that the team members had to pay their own expenses in<br />\nentering the South Atlantic meet and for one of the out-of-town trips.<br />\nThis, with $135 available in the treasury; and the track equipment is nowhere near adequate.<br />\nThe objections are concrete and based on fact, of which witness the<br />\naffirmation of the prominent athletes and campus leaders who sign their<br />\nnames herewith. But to continue:<br />\nTHE SCHEDULING of the games is a disgrace to the Hopkins.<br />\nWhenever we play any team beyond a third-rating in football or basketball we are notoriously a set-up, a pushover, or what have you. It's not<br />\nso bad losing if we play in our own class and without so much risk attached. But it is certainly bad for the morale of a team to know that<br />\nbefore it even begins a game it is universally recognized, even by the<br />\ncoaches, that defeat will be the outcome.<br />\nWE ARE AFRAID that if the Board of Trustees fails to approve<br />\nthe budget proposed this year, having- a three-thousand-dollar deficit<br />\nplanned for, that the place where economies will be made will be in the<br />\nmatter of equipment and traveling facilities for the teams, as we have<br />\nshown to have been the case last year.<br />\nWE BELIEVE the present administration has given convincing<br />\nevidence of inefficiency and blindness to the abuses around it. And we<br />\nare convinced that if conditions do not improve immediately that intercollegiate athletics will deteriorate to the point of abolition. In a sincere effort to avoid this state of affairs, the editors of THE NEWSLETTER and the members of Omicron Delta Kappa call for an accounting<br />\non the part of the administration and believe that nothing short of a<br />\nshake-up in personnel efficiency and organization, will answer this<br />\nproblem.<br /><br />\n50th Anniversary Program<br /><br />\nExtensive arrangements are under way in connection with the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary<br />\nof the club, the program for which<br />\nwill be given at the annual home<br />\nconcert on February 23.<br />\nThe poster contest which was recently announced is getting under<br />\nway.
