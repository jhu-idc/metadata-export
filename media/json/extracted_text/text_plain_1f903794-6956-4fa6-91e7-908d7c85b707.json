BELT.<br />\n<br />\nWe regret to announce that, owing to his graduation, Mr. Taylor<br />\nStarck is compelled to resign as editor-in-chief. It seems to us that<br />\nno one, except a member of the<br />\nBoard, can realize how ably Mr.<br />\nStarck has filled this office. In<br />\nfact, since taking office in February, he has worked untiringly for<br />\nthe best interests of the paper, sacrificing unlimited amounts 'of time<br />\nand energy. He worked unselfishly<br />\nfor both parts of the paper, realizing that it was quite as necessary<br />\nto build up the circulation as the<br />\nnews service.<br />\nWe cannot close the year without<br />\nexpressing our heartiest thanks to<br />\nMr. Ball, the registrar. Throughout the year he has assisted us at<br />\nevery turn. He has always been<br />\non hand with news, suggestions for<br />\nraising money and helpful advice,<br />\nand has always been willing.to go<br />\nto any amount of trouble to help<br />\nus secure information. And we feel<br />\nthat to him, as much as any one<br />\nelse, a great part of our success this<br />\nyear has been due.<br />\nWe take pleasure in announcing<br />\nthat Mr. Herbert E. Catlin and Mr.<br />\nGeorge Y. Rusk were elected to the<br />\nBoard at\u2022 the last meeting. Mr.<br />\nLindsay Rogers was elected editorin-chief for next year.<br />\nAgain we wish to remind our<br />\nsubscribers that we have not received as many renewals as we<br />\nwould like to have. No doubt you<br />\nhave simply overlooked it. We<br />\ntherefore ask that you take the renewal blank out of this\u2014the last<br />\nnumber of THE NEWS-LETTER for<br />\nthe current year\u2014and mail it to us<br />\nwithout fail this week.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER: ITS PAST AND<br />\nITS FUTURE.<br />\n<br />\nStanding at the ciose of another<br />\nyear, it might perhaps nbt be out of<br />\nplace to sum up what THE NEWS-,<br />\nLETTER has done and outline the<br />\nplans for its future development.<br />\nTwo years ago the Board then<br />\npublishing THE NEws-LETTER came<br />\nto the conclusion that a bi-weekly<br />\npublication such as it then was<br />\ncould be but little more than a failure under existing conditions. At<br />\nthat time the paper had deteriorated<br />\nsadly from its former vigor during<br />\nthe earlier years of the decade. The<br />\nsubscription list, in fact, totaled only<br />\nsixty-five, of which three were<br />\nalumni. According to Dr. Slosson,<br />\nindeed, the paper was of \"uncertain<br />\ncharacter and time of appearance.\"<br />\nThe present form was then adopted.<br />\nThe question was, Could a weekly<br />\nnewspaper be more successful in<br />\nuniting the undergraduates, graduates, meds and alumni?<br />\nWe believe that our past year's<br />\nexperience would fully justify an<br />\naffirmative conclusion. For since<br />\n.then our circulation has increased<br />\n700 per cent., of which more<br />\nthan half are alumni. The total<br />\namount of advertising has quadrupled, and we feel sure that everybody who has subscribed to THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER this year feels that<br />\nhe has been well repaid. At this<br />\npoint we might quote one, of the<br />\ndozens of letters that we have received recently, from an alumnus<br />\nboth of the undergraduate department and the Medical School, who<br />\nwas renewing his subscription:<br />\n\"THE NEws-LETTER has greatly<br />\nimproved and is still growing.. It<br />\nhas put me in touch with J. H. U.<br />\naffairs as I haven't been in ten<br />\nyears. I wouldn't discontinue it at<br />\nany cost.\"<br />\nAnother proof is that we are now<br />\non the rather restricted exchange<br />\nlist of the larger college dailies.<br />\nAnd next year the paper will continue in the same way. With good<br />\nprinting, good paper, and prompt<br />\nand correct mailing to the alumni.<br />\nIt is true that with few exceptions it is impossible to get absolutely fresh material for a paper<br />\nwhich appears but once.a week.<br />\nBut to disseminate news is not<br />\nthe sole function of a college paper.<br />\nMore important than any other reasons for its existence, perhaps, is<br />\nthe bond of common interest which<br />\nit supplies. It surely helps to a<br />\ngreat extent to knit the student<br />\nbody more firmly together and furnishes another outlet for the superfluous energy directed into so many<br />\nside channels. But we also wish<br />\nthat in the future the undergraduates should feel that the paper belongs to the student body and is not<br />\na close corporation. They should<br />\nnot feel that the paper is published<br />\nentirely apart from the student body<br />\nand that a subscription to it is a<br />\nbusiness matter pure and simple;<br />\nthey should consider the Board of<br />\nEditors as trustees, who conduct the<br />\npaper for the students.

This is the reason for the above<br />\nquotation, which is peculiarly appropriate, not because of its wit,<br />\nbut because, as will be remembered,<br />\n\"Billy\" was an actor and comedian<br />\nof no mean merit, the organizations<br />\nin Baltimore which suffered from<br />\nhis assistance being the Haresfoot<br />\nClub and \"Professor Napoleon.\"<br />\nWe recall a question which Tilt<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, quite unconscious of<br />\nany immediate answer, asked several weeks ago: \"How many members of the cast of \"Professor Napoleon\" will be married before the<br />\nyear is over?\" Number one is an-,<br />\nnounced\u2014\"Billy\" Haynes, the main'<br />\ngazabo of the show, one of the best<br />\nfellows who ever came to Hopkinsi<br />\nBut who would have thought it<br />\nAppearances are deceitful, and thM<br />\nthis is the case with Haynes we can:<br />\nsay without fear of contradiction<br />\n\"You can't use the figure, 'A Shil<br />\nof Matrimony,'\" he said oncej<br />\n\"Matrimony is not a ship; it is a<br />\nshipwreck. It may be a state, but<br />\nit is one of voluntary servitude.<br />\nNot for me.\" Quite clever, don't<br />\nyou think? But \"Billy\" always was<br />\nclever and free from the trammels<br />\nof conventionality. You never can<br />\ntell.<br />\nWhile at the University he played<br />\nmany parts, which, at the risk of<br />\nthis effusion degenerating into an<br />\nobituary notice, we are going to recount, so that on the eve of his<br />\nplaying this latest part we may hand<br />\ndown to posterity in the files of<br />\nTHE NMS-LETTER some brief account of his achievements.<br />\nIn his freshman year he organized the Haresfoot Club and played<br />\nthe stellar role (that was what he<br />\ncalled it) in the first Hopkins \"annual\" dramatic production. Needless to say, it was a success. It was<br />\nin this year also that he gave his<br />\ncelebrated lecture on \"Dogs.\" Tt<br />\nstill has the reputation of having<br />\nbeen one of the largest attended<br />\ntalks in the whole history of Johns<br />\nHopkins, and at the coriclusion autographed photographs of the lecturer<br />\nwere distributed. He distinctly disavowed, however, that these had<br />\nany connection with the subject of<br />\nthe lecture. In this year also he<br />\nstarted to wield his facile quill<br />\n(quoting him again) and thereby<br />\nenhanced the literary character of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThe second spasm of 1912's existence saw \"Billy\" the class president. It saw him mixed up in other<br />\n\u2022 activities, which are too numerous<br />\nto mention, and toward the close of<br />\nFIRST SUMMER SESSION<br />\nthe year he was elected editor-inchief of the Junior Hullabaloo,<br />\nwhich, unfortunately, never apJuly 5\u2014August 16, 1911<br />\npeared.

This cavern<br />\nis composed of a number of chambers, all communicating, and these<br />\nrooms are the abode of thousands<br />\nof bats. So thick are they that one<br />\nhas no difficulty at all in catching<br />\nthem. There is a deposit of their<br />\nexcrement many feet thick on the'<br />\nfloors of the rooms occupied by the<br />\nbats, and we were told that the sugar planters use it as a fertilizer for<br />\ntheir cane fields.<br />\nDr. McCatty, the gentleman from<br />\nwhom the University rented the<br />\nbuilding we used as a laboratory,<br />\nowns a large dairy farm near the<br />\nstation called Catadupa, a short distance from Montego Bay, on the<br />\nrailroad toward Kingston. At Dr.<br />\nMcCatty's invitation we had a<br />\nvery pleasant trip to this farm,<br />\nwhere we were entertained at lunch<br />\nby the Doctor and his wife. Catadupa is in the mountains, and the<br />\nview from the home was very fine<br />\nindeed. European or American cattle cannot live in Jamaica unless<br />\nkept in a stable all the time, because<br />\nthe ticks prove fatal to them, but<br />\nthe Jamaicans have apparently<br />\n,.solved this problem by a process<br />\nof interbreeding between these<br />\nbreeds and the long-horned East<br />\nIndian cattle, which are immune to<br />\nthe ticks.<br />\nLike many another neighborhood,<br />\nMontego Bay has its \"haunted\"<br />\nhouse. This is Rose Hall and was<br />\nthe home of Rose Palmer, who is<br />\nreported to have rid herself of two<br />\nhusbands by the use of poison and<br />\nwas herself killed by her negro<br />\nslaves on a plantation to which her<br />\nthird husband had banished her.<br />\nRose Hall is quite a large sugar<br />\nestate on the north coast of Jamaica, some miles east of Montego<br />\nBay, and Professor Andrews took<br />\nus to visit the place. The house has<br />\nfallen into great disrepair, but some<br />\nold family portraits are still hanging on the walls of the great reception hall, the dining-room and the<br />\nlibrary, which form the first story<br />\nof the building. The floor of this<br />\nstory is said to be of solid mahogany. The old negress who is care-,,<br />\ntaker for the place points out to<br />\none what she says are bloodstains<br />\non the floor of one of the secondstory rooms. In the parish church<br />\nat Montego Bay, beside the altar, is<br />\nan imposing marble memorial to a<br />\ncertain Rose Palmer, which consists<br />\nof a female figure drooping against<br />\na tall vase.<br />\nTo the laboratory the natives<br />\nwere continually bringing all sorts<br />\nof animal life\u2014toads, scorpions,<br />\nforty-legs, termites, soldier crabs,<br />\nthe Mongoose, etc. The native fisherman brought us all sorts of queer<br />\nfish, from the gorgeous parrot fish<br />\nand the yellow and black angel fish<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nto the swell-toad, with its armor of<br />\nJ.

It seems to us that<br />\nno one, except a member of the<br />\nBoard, can realize how ably Mr.<br />\nStarck has filled this office. In<br />\nfact, since taking office in February, he has worked untiringly for<br />\nthe best interests of the paper, sacrificing unlimited amounts 'of time<br />\nand energy. He worked unselfishly<br />\nfor both parts of the paper, realizing that it was quite as necessary<br />\nto build up the circulation as the<br />\nnews service.<br />\nWe cannot close the year without<br />\nexpressing our heartiest thanks to<br />\nMr. Ball, the registrar. Throughout the year he has assisted us at<br />\nevery turn. He has always been<br />\non hand with news, suggestions for<br />\nraising money and helpful advice,<br />\nand has always been willing.to go<br />\nto any amount of trouble to help<br />\nus secure information. And we feel<br />\nthat to him, as much as any one<br />\nelse, a great part of our success this<br />\nyear has been due.<br />\nWe take pleasure in announcing<br />\nthat Mr. Herbert E. Catlin and Mr.<br />\nGeorge Y. Rusk were elected to the<br />\nBoard at\u2022 the last meeting. Mr.<br />\nLindsay Rogers was elected editorin-chief for next year.<br />\nAgain we wish to remind our<br />\nsubscribers that we have not received as many renewals as we<br />\nwould like to have. No doubt you<br />\nhave simply overlooked it. We<br />\ntherefore ask that you take the renewal blank out of this\u2014the last<br />\nnumber of THE NEWS-LETTER for<br />\nthe current year\u2014and mail it to us<br />\nwithout fail this week.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER: ITS PAST AND<br />\nITS FUTURE.<br /><br />\nStanding at the ciose of another<br />\nyear, it might perhaps nbt be out of<br />\nplace to sum up what THE NEWS-,<br />\nLETTER has done and outline the<br />\nplans for its future development.<br />\nTwo years ago the Board then<br />\npublishing THE NEws-LETTER came<br />\nto the conclusion that a bi-weekly<br />\npublication such as it then was<br />\ncould be but little more than a failure under existing conditions. At<br />\nthat time the paper had deteriorated<br />\nsadly from its former vigor during<br />\nthe earlier years of the decade. The<br />\nsubscription list, in fact, totaled only<br />\nsixty-five, of which three were<br />\nalumni. According to Dr. Slosson,<br />\nindeed, the paper was of \"uncertain<br />\ncharacter and time of appearance.\"<br />\nThe present form was then adopted.<br />\nThe question was, Could a weekly<br />\nnewspaper be more successful in<br />\nuniting the undergraduates, graduates, meds and alumni?<br />\nWe believe that our past year's<br />\nexperience would fully justify an<br />\naffirmative conclusion. For since<br />\n.then our circulation has increased<br />\n700 per cent., of which more<br />\nthan half are alumni. The total<br />\namount of advertising has quadrupled, and we feel sure that everybody who has subscribed to THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER this year feels that<br />\nhe has been well repaid. At this<br />\npoint we might quote one, of the<br />\ndozens of letters that we have received recently, from an alumnus<br />\nboth of the undergraduate department and the Medical School, who<br />\nwas renewing his subscription:<br />\n\"THE NEws-LETTER has greatly<br />\nimproved and is still growing.. It<br />\nhas put me in touch with J. H. U.<br />\naffairs as I haven't been in ten<br />\nyears. I wouldn't discontinue it at<br />\nany cost.\"<br />\nAnother proof is that we are now<br />\non the rather restricted exchange<br />\nlist of the larger college dailies.<br />\nAnd next year the paper will continue in the same way. With good<br />\nprinting, good paper, and prompt<br />\nand correct mailing to the alumni.<br />\nIt is true that with few exceptions it is impossible to get absolutely fresh material for a paper<br />\nwhich appears but once.a week.<br />\nBut to disseminate news is not<br />\nthe sole function of a college paper.<br />\nMore important than any other reasons for its existence, perhaps, is<br />\nthe bond of common interest which<br />\nit supplies. It surely helps to a<br />\ngreat extent to knit the student<br />\nbody more firmly together and furnishes another outlet for the superfluous energy directed into so many<br />\nside channels. But we also wish<br />\nthat in the future the undergraduates should feel that the paper belongs to the student body and is not<br />\na close corporation. They should<br />\nnot feel that the paper is published<br />\nentirely apart from the student body<br />\nand that a subscription to it is a<br />\nbusiness matter pure and simple;<br />\nthey should consider the Board of<br />\nEditors as trustees, who conduct the<br />\npaper for the students.

This is the reason for the above<br />\nquotation, which is peculiarly appropriate, not because of its wit,<br />\nbut because, as will be remembered,<br />\n\"Billy\" was an actor and comedian<br />\nof no mean merit, the organizations<br />\nin Baltimore which suffered from<br />\nhis assistance being the Haresfoot<br />\nClub and \"Professor Napoleon.\"<br />\nWe recall a question which Tilt<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, quite unconscious of<br />\nany immediate answer, asked several weeks ago: \"How many members of the cast of \"Professor Napoleon\" will be married before the<br />\nyear is over?\" Number one is an-,<br />\nnounced\u2014\"Billy\" Haynes, the main'<br />\ngazabo of the show, one of the best<br />\nfellows who ever came to Hopkinsi<br />\nBut who would have thought it<br />\nAppearances are deceitful, and thM<br />\nthis is the case with Haynes we can:<br />\nsay without fear of contradiction<br />\n\"You can't use the figure, 'A Shil<br />\nof Matrimony,'\" he said oncej<br />\n\"Matrimony is not a ship; it is a<br />\nshipwreck. It may be a state, but<br />\nit is one of voluntary servitude.<br />\nNot for me.\" Quite clever, don't<br />\nyou think? But \"Billy\" always was<br />\nclever and free from the trammels<br />\nof conventionality. You never can<br />\ntell.<br />\nWhile at the University he played<br />\nmany parts, which, at the risk of<br />\nthis effusion degenerating into an<br />\nobituary notice, we are going to recount, so that on the eve of his<br />\nplaying this latest part we may hand<br />\ndown to posterity in the files of<br />\nTHE NMS-LETTER some brief account of his achievements.<br />\nIn his freshman year he organized the Haresfoot Club and played<br />\nthe stellar role (that was what he<br />\ncalled it) in the first Hopkins \"annual\" dramatic production. Needless to say, it was a success. It was<br />\nin this year also that he gave his<br />\ncelebrated lecture on \"Dogs.\" Tt<br />\nstill has the reputation of having<br />\nbeen one of the largest attended<br />\ntalks in the whole history of Johns<br />\nHopkins, and at the coriclusion autographed photographs of the lecturer<br />\nwere distributed. He distinctly disavowed, however, that these had<br />\nany connection with the subject of<br />\nthe lecture. In this year also he<br />\nstarted to wield his facile quill<br />\n(quoting him again) and thereby<br />\nenhanced the literary character of<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThe second spasm of 1912's existence saw \"Billy\" the class president. It saw him mixed up in other<br />\n\u2022 activities, which are too numerous<br />\nto mention, and toward the close of<br />\nFIRST SUMMER SESSION<br />\nthe year he was elected editor-inchief of the Junior Hullabaloo,<br />\nwhich, unfortunately, never apJuly 5\u2014August 16, 1911<br />\npeared.

This cavern<br />\nis composed of a number of chambers, all communicating, and these<br />\nrooms are the abode of thousands<br />\nof bats. So thick are they that one<br />\nhas no difficulty at all in catching<br />\nthem. There is a deposit of their<br />\nexcrement many feet thick on the'<br />\nfloors of the rooms occupied by the<br />\nbats, and we were told that the sugar planters use it as a fertilizer for<br />\ntheir cane fields.<br />\nDr. McCatty, the gentleman from<br />\nwhom the University rented the<br />\nbuilding we used as a laboratory,<br />\nowns a large dairy farm near the<br />\nstation called Catadupa, a short distance from Montego Bay, on the<br />\nrailroad toward Kingston. At Dr.<br />\nMcCatty's invitation we had a<br />\nvery pleasant trip to this farm,<br />\nwhere we were entertained at lunch<br />\nby the Doctor and his wife. Catadupa is in the mountains, and the<br />\nview from the home was very fine<br />\nindeed. European or American cattle cannot live in Jamaica unless<br />\nkept in a stable all the time, because<br />\nthe ticks prove fatal to them, but<br />\nthe Jamaicans have apparently<br />\n,.solved this problem by a process<br />\nof interbreeding between these<br />\nbreeds and the long-horned East<br />\nIndian cattle, which are immune to<br />\nthe ticks.<br />\nLike many another neighborhood,<br />\nMontego Bay has its \"haunted\"<br />\nhouse. This is Rose Hall and was<br />\nthe home of Rose Palmer, who is<br />\nreported to have rid herself of two<br />\nhusbands by the use of poison and<br />\nwas herself killed by her negro<br />\nslaves on a plantation to which her<br />\nthird husband had banished her.<br />\nRose Hall is quite a large sugar<br />\nestate on the north coast of Jamaica, some miles east of Montego<br />\nBay, and Professor Andrews took<br />\nus to visit the place. The house has<br />\nfallen into great disrepair, but some<br />\nold family portraits are still hanging on the walls of the great reception hall, the dining-room and the<br />\nlibrary, which form the first story<br />\nof the building. The floor of this<br />\nstory is said to be of solid mahogany. The old negress who is care-,,<br />\ntaker for the place points out to<br />\none what she says are bloodstains<br />\non the floor of one of the secondstory rooms. In the parish church<br />\nat Montego Bay, beside the altar, is<br />\nan imposing marble memorial to a<br />\ncertain Rose Palmer, which consists<br />\nof a female figure drooping against<br />\na tall vase.<br />\nTo the laboratory the natives<br />\nwere continually bringing all sorts<br />\nof animal life\u2014toads, scorpions,<br />\nforty-legs, termites, soldier crabs,<br />\nthe Mongoose, etc. The native fisherman brought us all sorts of queer<br />\nfish, from the gorgeous parrot fish<br />\nand the yellow and black angel fish<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nto the swell-toad, with its armor of<br />\nJ.
