To the everyday college undergraduate, the seriousness of such a question as armament limitation forces him to relegate it to that group of subjects which he knows he should be interested in, but which he rather automatically steers clear of. It is<br />\nrather a characteristic thing among American college students\u2014this<br />\nmanifest disinterest and almost utter apathy regarding the more<br />\nprofound issues of the day.<br />\nIt must have been this tendency which prompted President<br />\nHibben of Princeton University to conceive this idea of a conference<br />\nfor the discussion of the disarmament question. With the date of<br />\nHibben<br />\nthe Washington Conference looming near at hand, Dr.<br />\ngrasped this opportunity of bringing this all-important issue before<br />\ncolthe thought of each undergraduate student in our Eastern<br />\nleges. Again there might be a pressure brought to bear on branches<br />\nof public opinion other than the student thought.<br />\nBefore the conference took place word went out from Princeton<br />\nthat it was not the purpose or hope of the conference to exercise any<br />\ninfluence at the larger conference in Washington. The intention<br />\nof this meeting at Princeton was to\u2022 arouse interest and stimulate<br />\ndiscussion among college students of the disarmament question. We<br />\nmay say that it has accomplished pretty well that which it strove to<br />\nbring about. The response and interest which has been aroused is<br />\nan excellent thing. Why should the men who will probably have to<br />\nbear the brunt of future wars remain quiet and think disinterestedly<br />\non this subject? It is to be hoped that the considerate thought of<br />\nevery Hopkins student is given over to the possible settlement of<br />\nthis menace. It is a very adequate way of showing appreciation for<br />\nthose in Flanders Field.<br />\n<br />\nTHE POST-SEASON GAME<br />\nIt is with great pleasure that we learn of the possibility of a postseason football game with the University of Florida. Some of the<br />\nolder students may remember that the News-Letter advocated closer<br />\nathletic relations with Southern colleges in its editorial column last<br />\nspring, and the opportunities which Florida's proposition opens in<br />\nthis field are well worthy of consideration.<br />\nWe would like on this occasion to repeat our belief that Hopkins<br />\nfuture rests with the Southern -rather than the Northern colleges;<br />\nthat, with the acquisition of dormitories, the majority of out-of-town<br />\nstudents will come from South of the Mason-Dixon Line; and that<br />\nanything which will strengthen our relations with the colleges in<br />\nthis region will be to our advantage.<br />\nOur relations with this University have been most cordial, and<br />\nwe believe that a mutual respect for both institutions has<br />\nbeen instilled in the student bodies. We have not felt this same re<br />\nspect for some other colleges. The game with Florida, if consum<br />\nmated, would give us an additional opportunity to experience what<br />\nwe are sure will prove to be true Southern hospitality. Let us hope<br />\nthat it will prove to be a forerunner of our closer athletic relations<br />\nwith the South.<br />\n<br />\nLIBERTY<br />\n<br />\nEstablished 1873<br />\n<br />\nExpert Cleaners and Dyers<br />\n<br />\nA.H.Fetting Man'fg Jewelry Co.<br />\n<br />\nManufacturers<br />\nFraternity Jewelry<br />\nLetter<br />\nGreek<br />\nHomewood 5205-W 213 N.

To the everyday college undergraduate, the seriousness of such a question as armament limitation forces him to relegate it to that group of subjects which he knows he should be interested in, but which he rather automatically steers clear of. It is<br />\nrather a characteristic thing among American college students\u2014this<br />\nmanifest disinterest and almost utter apathy regarding the more<br />\nprofound issues of the day.<br />\nIt must have been this tendency which prompted President<br />\nHibben of Princeton University to conceive this idea of a conference<br />\nfor the discussion of the disarmament question. With the date of<br />\nHibben<br />\nthe Washington Conference looming near at hand, Dr.<br />\ngrasped this opportunity of bringing this all-important issue before<br />\ncolthe thought of each undergraduate student in our Eastern<br />\nleges. Again there might be a pressure brought to bear on branches<br />\nof public opinion other than the student thought.<br />\nBefore the conference took place word went out from Princeton<br />\nthat it was not the purpose or hope of the conference to exercise any<br />\ninfluence at the larger conference in Washington. The intention<br />\nof this meeting at Princeton was to\u2022 arouse interest and stimulate<br />\ndiscussion among college students of the disarmament question. We<br />\nmay say that it has accomplished pretty well that which it strove to<br />\nbring about. The response and interest which has been aroused is<br />\nan excellent thing. Why should the men who will probably have to<br />\nbear the brunt of future wars remain quiet and think disinterestedly<br />\non this subject? It is to be hoped that the considerate thought of<br />\nevery Hopkins student is given over to the possible settlement of<br />\nthis menace. It is a very adequate way of showing appreciation for<br />\nthose in Flanders Field.<br /><br />\nTHE POST-SEASON GAME<br />\nIt is with great pleasure that we learn of the possibility of a postseason football game with the University of Florida. Some of the<br />\nolder students may remember that the News-Letter advocated closer<br />\nathletic relations with Southern colleges in its editorial column last<br />\nspring, and the opportunities which Florida's proposition opens in<br />\nthis field are well worthy of consideration.<br />\nWe would like on this occasion to repeat our belief that Hopkins<br />\nfuture rests with the Southern -rather than the Northern colleges;<br />\nthat, with the acquisition of dormitories, the majority of out-of-town<br />\nstudents will come from South of the Mason-Dixon Line; and that<br />\nanything which will strengthen our relations with the colleges in<br />\nthis region will be to our advantage.<br />\nOur relations with this University have been most cordial, and<br />\nwe believe that a mutual respect for both institutions has<br />\nbeen instilled in the student bodies. We have not felt this same re<br />\nspect for some other colleges. The game with Florida, if consum<br />\nmated, would give us an additional opportunity to experience what<br />\nwe are sure will prove to be true Southern hospitality. Let us hope<br />\nthat it will prove to be a forerunner of our closer athletic relations<br />\nwith the South.<br /><br />\nLIBERTY<br /><br />\nEstablished 1873<br /><br />\nExpert Cleaners and Dyers<br /><br />\nA.H.Fetting Man'fg Jewelry Co.<br /><br />\nManufacturers<br />\nFraternity Jewelry<br />\nLetter<br />\nGreek<br />\nHomewood 5205-W 213 N.
