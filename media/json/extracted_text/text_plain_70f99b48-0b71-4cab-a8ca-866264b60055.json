A<br />\nhyperkinetic since birth, his mind raced from idea to<br />\nidea like a Chipmunks album at 78 rpm. As a freshman at Cal Tech, he quickly took to the music scene<br />\ndespite his studies and was an intensely prolific songwriter.<br />\nMotor Skills is a detailed account of his meteoric<br />\nrise to fame, his excruciating cheetos addiction, and<br />\nthe subsequent failure of the band's second album\u2014<br />\nall in the span of three week's time. It documents<br />\nthe new American dream, raw and vulgar, sanctifying the ideals of living fast and high and burning up<br />\non re-entry. The book recreates the disorientation of<br />\nhitting escape velocity but firing your retros too late,<br />\nkeeping zero attitude but losing your tracking radar<br />\ncommunications with ground control, hopelessly<br />\nthrowing you into a asynchronous orbit. It's tragic.<br />\nViscous kept the diary in his spare time (which was<br />\nabout every five minutes). Here is an excerpt.<br />\nChapter One: The Early Days<br />\n8:00 AM - Wake up. Shower.

He<br />\nsays it's no problem since Bono can't play one either,<br />\nand he did really well with Cher in the sixties.<br />\n8:31 AM - I change my name to Eric Vicious, but my<br />\nfriends call me \"Ric the Vic.\" If they don't, they're<br />\nno friends of mine.<br />\n<br />\n8:33 AM - Pick up my roommate's electric guitar<br />\n<br />\nand give it a strum.

If anyone calls me \"Ric the Vic\",<br />\nthey're no friend of mine.<br />\n9:30 AM - Going down to the docks to find some<br />\nclassy musicians.<br />\n10:42 AM - Is this my lucky day or what?

For years,<br />\nfriends had laughed at Costello while singing \"American<br />\nPie.\" The British guitarist<br />\nhad never seen Holly, and<br />\nfound the photo by accident.<br />\nHe was stunned - the two<br />\nwere indistinguishable,<br />\nThe ensuing months can<br />\nonly be described as a rockand-roll dream. Costello flew<br />\nto the States and drove to<br />\nHolly's parents' house in<br />\nColumbia, MD. Mrs. Holly<br />\nled Costello up to Buddy's<br />\nroom, where his then 49year-old lookalike was lying<br />\non his bed and reading a<br />\ncomic. The two introduced<br />\nthemselves and quickly hit it<br />\noff. Shortly afterwards, Holly<br />\ndusted off his guitar. They<br />\nwrote some songs and drove<br />\nup to New York in Costello's<br />\nAston-Martin to record them.<br />\nThen they found Steve Lillywhite, and asked him if<br />\nhe'd mind producing.<br />\nAnd last week, after months<br />\nof guitar riffs and production<br />\nmixes, the first Holly-Costello<br />\nalbum, Frosty, is out on the<br />\nSire label. Costello chose the<br />\nname in order to distinguish<br />\nit from his tough new solo<br />\nnamed Spike. And where<br />\nSpike finishes, Frosty begins,<br />\nwith jumper-cables of guitar<br />\n<br />\nexcitement.<br />\nPerhaps the most remarkable and pleasing thing about<br />\nFrosty is the chemistry Costello shares with Holly.

A<br />\nhyperkinetic since birth, his mind raced from idea to<br />\nidea like a Chipmunks album at 78 rpm. As a freshman at Cal Tech, he quickly took to the music scene<br />\ndespite his studies and was an intensely prolific songwriter.<br />\nMotor Skills is a detailed account of his meteoric<br />\nrise to fame, his excruciating cheetos addiction, and<br />\nthe subsequent failure of the band's second album\u2014<br />\nall in the span of three week's time. It documents<br />\nthe new American dream, raw and vulgar, sanctifying the ideals of living fast and high and burning up<br />\non re-entry. The book recreates the disorientation of<br />\nhitting escape velocity but firing your retros too late,<br />\nkeeping zero attitude but losing your tracking radar<br />\ncommunications with ground control, hopelessly<br />\nthrowing you into a asynchronous orbit. It's tragic.<br />\nViscous kept the diary in his spare time (which was<br />\nabout every five minutes). Here is an excerpt.<br />\nChapter One: The Early Days<br />\n8:00 AM - Wake up. Shower.

I'm not even sure how to hold it. He<br />\nsays it's no problem since Bono can't play one either,<br />\nand he did really well with Cher in the sixties.<br />\n8:31 AM - I change my name to Eric Vicious, but my<br />\nfriends call me \"Ric the Vic.\" If they don't, they're<br />\nno friends of mine.<br /><br />\n8:33 AM - Pick up my roommate's electric guitar<br /><br />\nand give it a strum. Loud.<br />\nDiscordant. Perfe,t.<br />\n9:02 AM - Drop out of school to devote all my time<br />\nto the band.<br />\n9:03 AM - Realization hits that me and Jim are the<br />\nband, so I set out to find a bass guitarist and a drummer (Jim plays keyboards).<br />\n9:17 AM - I write my first song: \"I Want to French<br />\nYour Poodle\" for drums, guitar, and chainsaw.<br />\n9:20 AM - Jeepers, I never realized my true militant<br />\nself until I started this punk group.<br />\n9:22 AM - I change my name to Eric<br />\nI'llfuckupyourfacewheneverIwant. But my friends<br />\ncall me 'Tuck up\". If anyone calls me \"Ric the Vic\",<br />\nthey're no friend of mine.<br />\n9:30 AM - Going down to the docks to find some<br />\nclassy musicians.<br />\n10:42 AM - Is this my lucky day or what? I found a<br />\nbass player named Sparabuc and a drummer named<br />\nDrownzo.<br />\n10:51 AM - I've decided to call the band \"Rectal<br />\nPower Drill\" because it seems to fit the mood of our<br />\nmusic.

For years,<br />\nfriends had laughed at Costello while singing \"American<br />\nPie.\" The British guitarist<br />\nhad never seen Holly, and<br />\nfound the photo by accident.<br />\nHe was stunned - the two<br />\nwere indistinguishable,<br />\nThe ensuing months can<br />\nonly be described as a rockand-roll dream. Costello flew<br />\nto the States and drove to<br />\nHolly's parents' house in<br />\nColumbia, MD. Mrs. Holly<br />\nled Costello up to Buddy's<br />\nroom, where his then 49year-old lookalike was lying<br />\non his bed and reading a<br />\ncomic. The two introduced<br />\nthemselves and quickly hit it<br />\noff. Shortly afterwards, Holly<br />\ndusted off his guitar. They<br />\nwrote some songs and drove<br />\nup to New York in Costello's<br />\nAston-Martin to record them.<br />\nThen they found Steve Lillywhite, and asked him if<br />\nhe'd mind producing.<br />\nAnd last week, after months<br />\nof guitar riffs and production<br />\nmixes, the first Holly-Costello<br />\nalbum, Frosty, is out on the<br />\nSire label. Costello chose the<br />\nname in order to distinguish<br />\nit from his tough new solo<br />\nnamed Spike. And where<br />\nSpike finishes, Frosty begins,<br />\nwith jumper-cables of guitar<br /><br />\nexcitement.<br />\nPerhaps the most remarkable and pleasing thing about<br />\nFrosty is the chemistry Costello shares with Holly. Their<br />\nvoices are similar in most<br />\nplaces, preventing the need<br />\nfor 80's-slick-powerpop overdubbing, and where the two<br />\nfluctuate slightly, the recordings contain a pleasant warble, such as on 'Blue Sea,\"<br />\nthe first single from the collaboration. In this track, Holly<br />\nsings tenor while Costello<br />\nstrains to sing at soprano,<br />\nproducing a vocal effort at<br />\nonce endearing and addictive.<br />\nAnother key track is the<br />\nLatino-Afro-Country<br />\ntune,<br />\n\"Got Boots, Got Dem<br />\nThangs.\" The guitar work<br />\nhere is, as always, hooky,<br />\nstaccatoed, and crispy. Holly<br />\ndusts off his pen, dormant for<br />\n30 years, to produce some<br />\nthoughtful, ponderous lyrics:<br />\n'When I saw the flamenco/ I<br />\nknew was time to go/ So I<br />\nput my boots/ Put my/ Got<br />\nmy boots dem thangs.\" The<br />\nspiralling snaky guitar from<br />\nCostello produces a surreal<br />\nworld-sound reminiscent of<br />\nBushmen folkchants and Redneck fiddles.<br />\nSide one ends with the masterful duet \"Time to Find It,\"<br />\na veritable tour de force of<br />\nsliding hooks and icy vocals<br />\nfrom the two gentlemen.<br />\nComparisons with all great<br />\nguitarists from Jerry Garcia<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nActivities Calendar<br />\nFRIDAY, APRIL 28<br /><br />\nMONDAY, MAY 1<br /><br />\n8 and 10:15 p.m Senior Gass: Star 4 p.m Public hanging of all non-English<br />\nspeaking TA's<br />\nRefreshments will<br />\nWars--APL Auditorium $3 admission,<br />\nbe served<br />\n$2 students, warmongers free<br />\nWiliam Henry VVelch Lec9 p.m-2 am Grad Gub hosts Eddie 7:30 p.m<br />\nture Series presents D.
