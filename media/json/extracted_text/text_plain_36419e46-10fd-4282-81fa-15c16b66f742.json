He is<br />\na good conscientious man of sound<br />\nprinciples. He believes in the :direct election of United States senators, the reduction of the tariff,<br />\nand a commission for handling the<br />\ntrusts.\"<br />\n\"Why am I for Taft?\" asked G.<br />\nV. Rusk, the most outspoken adherent of the President in the<br />\nsenior class. \"I am for him because he has had every trust which<br />\nhas broken the law of the land<br />\nbrought before the bar of justice,<br />\nwhether friendly or hostile to his<br />\nadministration. The trusts that arc<br />\nbacking Roosevelt are the trusts<br />\nwhich are being prosecuted by<br />\nPresident Taft. I am for him because he signed the Paine Tariff<br />\nfin, which on the whole. provided<br />\nlower schedules, and which called<br />\nfor the establishment of a nonpartisan tariff board. If the Democrats had not nullified that Board<br />\n'they would not now 'be able to go<br />\nbefore the country today on the<br />\ntariff question.

From start to finish Miss<br />\n1..familton held the attention of<br />\nevery one of the fifty men who<br />\ngathered to hear her.<br />\nMiss Hamilton began her address by announcing that she had<br />\nnothing to say to those men who '<br />\nwere instinctively interested in new<br />\nthings; but would address herself<br />\nto the conservatives. She pointed<br />\nout that as woman's suffrage exists in greater or less degree in<br />\nPersia, Siam, Norway, Finland, in<br />\nthe region of the Caucasus, in Australia, in England, and in six of<br />\nour own States, it is no new thing.<br />\nIf it's good we must help it ; if bad,<br />\nfight it. No longer does woman<br />\nsuffragists believe that the millennium will be ushered in when wornen are given the ballot. Nor- do<br />\nthey believe that politics will be<br />\ngreatly purified. But they are striving- for their end because they believe that woman's place is in the<br />\nhome and that she can competently<br />\nfill that place only by exercising the<br />\nsuffrage. .Today half of the things<br />\nwhich formerly were done in the<br />\nhome are done outside it: The<br />\nbaking of bread, the making of<br />\ngarments, the teaching of children.<br />\nWomen can supervise these things<br />\nonly by the exercise of the suffrage,<br />\nand only by the exercise of the suffrage can they safeguard the health<br />\nand morals of their children.<br />\nNext Thursday's meeting of the<br />\nSociety will be an arbitration meeting-, at which John S. Dickinson,<br />\n'13, will read i paper on \"How Far<br />\nPeace?\" There will be other addresses and general discussion.<br />\nAll students who wish to join the<br />\nSociety at this time are requested<br />\nto be present at this meeting and<br />\nhand their names to J.

Dickinson, '13,<br />\nE.<br />\nwas elected chairman, and<br />\nCorner, '14, secretary. The Council consists of F. C. Lee, president<br />\nof the Athletic Asociatn;'<br />\nJ. S.<br />\nDickinson and C. L. Getz, delegates<br />\nfrom the senior class; H. E. Corner<br />\nand A. L. Hammond, delegates<br />\nfrom the juniors; C. I. Uhler,<br />\nsophomore delegate, and G. D.<br />\nPenniman, Jr., freshman delegate.<br />\nThe Council discussed a tenative<br />\nprogram of measures which it will<br />\nrecommend in fulfillment of its<br />\nduty to adjust relations between<br />\nvarious classes of students at the<br />\nUniversity. The two subjects upon<br />\nwhich it was decided to take immediate action were non-fraternity<br />\nrepresentation on the Cotillon Board<br />\nand the abolition of freshmansophomore football games.<br />\nAt present the Johns Hopkins<br />\nCotillon Uoard consists of six<br />\nmembers, each one of whom is a<br />\nrepresentative of one of the six.fraternities established at the ITniversity. There has been a growing<br />\nfeeling during the past year or two<br />\nthat the non-fraternity men, a large<br />\nnumber of whom patronized the<br />\ncotillons, should have some representation on the Board. This feeling has at length reached proportions which caused the Council to<br />\nthink that it should be recognized.<br />\n'['lie ideal condition of affairs would<br />\nbe for the cotillons to be regular<br />\nstudent activities, arranged by a<br />\n\u2022 board elected by the whole student<br />\nbody, but it was perceived that the<br />\ntransition to such a state would not<br />\nbe effected at once, and it was<br />\ntherefore decided that ill addition<br />\nto the six fraternity men on the<br />\nBoard there should be four 11011fraternity men, to be elected by the<br />\nnon-fraternity men of each of the<br />\nfour classes. F. C. Lee and H. E.<br />\nCorner were appointed a committee<br />\nto embody this decision in a recommendation and submit it to the Cotillon Board.<br />\nThe second subject taken up was<br />\nthe abolition of freshman-sopho\u2022 more football games. Because of<br />\nthe relatively small number of men<br />\nupon NVI10111 the classes can draw<br />\nfor their teams, men feel called<br />\nupon to enter these games who<br />\nhave not had the requisite amount<br />\n, of previous training, and who arc<br />\nnot fit physically Ito play so stiff a<br />\ngame as football. For this reason<br />\n<br />\nHopkins put up a beautiful defensive game on Saturday against<br />\nSwarthmore at Swarthmore, and<br />\nsurprised a number of followers<br />\nby holding the heavier and more<br />\nexperienced team to a 40 to 6 score.<br />\nSwarthmore outweighed the 'Varsity team twenty pounds to a man,<br />\nand taking into consideration the<br />\nexcellent record the Pennsylvania<br />\nteam has made this season, many<br />\npersons .had expected to see Hopkins overwhelmed by a score much<br />\nlarger than forty points..<br />\nCaptain Gillett and Percy Hall<br />\nwere the particular stars of the losing eleven. Gillett, at fullback,<br />\neasily outpunted McKissick, and he<br />\nmade the two field goals that were<br />\nthe only points scored by Il'opkins.<br />\nHall .made an excellent record<br />\nfor himself at right end. He ran<br />\ndown under a number of punts and<br />\nmade several. beautiful catches of<br />\nGillett's forward passes.<br />\nIn the first two quarters Hopkins failed to make a third down.<br />\nThe team could not push the heavy<br />\nopposing line for any great distances. Later, in the third period,<br />\nthe 'Varsity took a brace and the<br />\nteam manipulated the ball in better<br />\nstyle. In the last quarter the pigskin was worked downfield three<br />\ntimes within kicking distance of the<br />\ngoal posts, and two goals from field<br />\nwere made by Gillett's toe. One<br />\nwas kicked from the 40 and the<br />\nother from the 20 'yard line.<br />\nSwarthmore scored a touchdown<br />\na few minutes after the first quarter<br />\nbegan on gains made by two beautiful forward passes, one of which<br />\nwent for 20 yards.<br />\nThree touchdowns were made in<br />\nthe second period, and then the<br />\nSwarthmore coaches beg-an sending<br />\nin substitutes. The third quarter<br />\nbrought another touchdown for the<br />\nGarnets, when Clime intercepted<br />\nGillett's pass and ran half the<br />\nlength of the field to the goal.<br />\n:\\fter these three periods of scoring by the Garnet eleven, Hopkins<br />\ntook a brace and became more aggressive. The line held wonderfully well against the heavier opponents and assisted materially in<br />\nthe two sallies toward the Swarthmore goal posts that gave Gillett<br />\nhis chances to kick the field goals.<br />\nNone of the 'Varsity players was<br />\ninjured in the contest, a fact which<br />\nshows that the team was in good<br />\ncondition.<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page S, col. 2.)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page S col. 3.;<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 7, col. 1.)<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 28, 1912.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n'TheApparel Oft Proclaims theMan'<br />\nTherefore: Patronize those<br />\n<br />\nWho study style; Who are exclusive; Who<br />\nalways have the \"latest for 'Varsity men\"<br />\n<br />\nJOEL GUTMAN & CO.<br />\n112 to 122 NORTH EUTAW STREET<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE LAW SCHOOL<br />\n849 N.

The contribt\\tions of the Maccabees to Jewish<br />\nhistory and the subsequent developments during the beginning of the<br />\nChristian era were discussed. The<br />\nlecture closed with an account of<br />\nthe place of Judas Maccabaeus<br />\namong the \"nine worthies\" of literature.<br />\nBoth lectures were well illustrated by lantern slides of temples,<br />\ntrated by lantern slides, adding to<br />\nthe interest of the discourses.<br />\n<br />\nTome Men Form Club.<br />\nFollowing the example set at other<br />\ncolleges and universities throughout the country, the Tome Institute<br />\nmen at Hopkins have formed a I.\u2014American Journal of Math metics.<br />\nTome Club.<br />\nF.

In the five remaining<br />\ngames Hopkins is expected to make<br />\na much better showing than in those<br />\nthat have been played up to the<br />\npresent time. The hardest games<br />\nare now past, and certainly to have<br />\nbeen defeated by Swarthmore and<br />\nNavy was no disgrace.<br />\nFor the past few years the games<br />\nbetwen Hopkins and Stevens have<br />\nbeen exceptionally close. Pieper<br />\nwon the game against Stevens three<br />\nyears ago by making a touchdown<br />\nafter a long run. The score was<br />\n6 to o. In 1910 Stevens won after<br />\na hard battle by the extremely close<br />\nscore of 2 to o.

Those duties at bottom<br />\nall amount to one thing--the adjustment of relations between opposing classes of interests in the<br />\nUniversity. The Council has already moderated between class-officers .and class-members by undertaking .to fix the dates of class elections ; and between freshman and<br />\nsophomores by supervising the<br />\nfreshman election. But these undertakings were relatively unimportant ; in taking .up the cotillon question the council approaches for the<br />\nfirst time a matter of prime importance.<br />\nThis is not the place to go into<br />\nthe merits of the question. How<br />\nthe Council has dealt with the<br />\nsituation, and what were its reasons<br />\nfor coming to the conclusion that<br />\nit did are matters of interest and<br />\nsignificance, but after all of less<br />\ninterest and significance than the<br />\nbare fact that a duly elected representative body of students took<br />\nup the question at all. In this fact<br />\nis to be read the beginning- of a new<br />\nera at Hopkins ; an era in which<br />\nold customs will no longer be followed among the students merely<br />\nbecause they are customs, but \\yin<br />\nbe subjected by a student committee to a rigid scrutiny to see whether<br />\nthey are just, beneficial. and necessary, or merely unjust and dangerous. The Student Council has taken<br />\na step further in this direction by<br />\nrecommending the abolition of the<br />\nfreshman-sophomore football game.<br />\nThis game has long been a feature<br />\nof every season. There are many<br />\nwho will be sorry to see it go, but<br />\nexperience seems to have shown<br />\nconclusively that it is one of the<br />\nustoms which are unnecessary and<br />\ndangerous.

He can force 1his<br />\n' I<br />\nbills through Congress with his big<br />\nstick. Wilson is too vague; he does \u2022<br />\nnot state his i)osition on the real ;<br />\nissues. Roosevelt has the right<br />\nidea about the tariff\u2014to \u2022 regulate<br />\nthe tariff through the Taft Tariff<br />\nCommission.\"<br />\n\"Why are you.for Wilson,\" asked<br />\na representative of Tim NEWSLETTF,R of J. Earle Uhler, senior ;<br />\ndelegate on the Executive Committee of the Wilson Club. \"I am for<br />\nhim,\" he replied after a moment's<br />\nthought, \"because his record is more<br />\nthe record of a statesman and gentleman than of a politician. He is<br />\na good conscientious man of sound<br />\nprinciples. He believes in the :direct election of United States senators, the reduction of the tariff,<br />\nand a commission for handling the<br />\ntrusts.\"<br />\n\"Why am I for Taft?\" asked G.<br />\nV. Rusk, the most outspoken adherent of the President in the<br />\nsenior class. \"I am for him because he has had every trust which<br />\nhas broken the law of the land<br />\nbrought before the bar of justice,<br />\nwhether friendly or hostile to his<br />\nadministration. The trusts that arc<br />\nbacking Roosevelt are the trusts<br />\nwhich are being prosecuted by<br />\nPresident Taft. I am for him because he signed the Paine Tariff<br />\nfin, which on the whole. provided<br />\nlower schedules, and which called<br />\nfor the establishment of a nonpartisan tariff board. If the Democrats had not nullified that Board<br />\n'they would not now 'be able to go<br />\nbefore the country today on the<br />\ntariff question.

From start to finish Miss<br />\n1..familton held the attention of<br />\nevery one of the fifty men who<br />\ngathered to hear her.<br />\nMiss Hamilton began her address by announcing that she had<br />\nnothing to say to those men who '<br />\nwere instinctively interested in new<br />\nthings; but would address herself<br />\nto the conservatives. She pointed<br />\nout that as woman's suffrage exists in greater or less degree in<br />\nPersia, Siam, Norway, Finland, in<br />\nthe region of the Caucasus, in Australia, in England, and in six of<br />\nour own States, it is no new thing.<br />\nIf it's good we must help it ; if bad,<br />\nfight it. No longer does woman<br />\nsuffragists believe that the millennium will be ushered in when wornen are given the ballot. Nor- do<br />\nthey believe that politics will be<br />\ngreatly purified. But they are striving- for their end because they believe that woman's place is in the<br />\nhome and that she can competently<br />\nfill that place only by exercising the<br />\nsuffrage. .Today half of the things<br />\nwhich formerly were done in the<br />\nhome are done outside it: The<br />\nbaking of bread, the making of<br />\ngarments, the teaching of children.<br />\nWomen can supervise these things<br />\nonly by the exercise of the suffrage,<br />\nand only by the exercise of the suffrage can they safeguard the health<br />\nand morals of their children.<br />\nNext Thursday's meeting of the<br />\nSociety will be an arbitration meeting-, at which John S. Dickinson,<br />\n'13, will read i paper on \"How Far<br />\nPeace?\" There will be other addresses and general discussion.<br />\nAll students who wish to join the<br />\nSociety at this time are requested<br />\nto be present at this meeting and<br />\nhand their names to J.

Weber, '14, chairman of the Marlmrg Medal Committee, desires all freshmen who<br />\nintend to compete for the medal to<br />\nhand their names to him within the<br />\nnext two weeks. This-medal is<br />\noffered each year by the Society to<br />\nthat member of the freshman class<br />\nwho -submits the best essay On st)me<br />\nsubject connected with arbitration.<br />\nFurther information in regard to<br />\nthe contest may be had from Mr.<br />\nWeber.<br /><br />\nThe Student Council for the year ;<br />\n[912-13 met in the Trophy Room '<br />\nlast Wednesday at five o'clock and<br />\norganized. ; John S. Dickinson, '13,<br />\nE.<br />\nwas elected chairman, and<br />\nCorner, '14, secretary. The Council consists of F. C. Lee, president<br />\nof the Athletic Asociatn;'<br />\nJ. S.<br />\nDickinson and C. L. Getz, delegates<br />\nfrom the senior class; H. E. Corner<br />\nand A. L. Hammond, delegates<br />\nfrom the juniors; C. I. Uhler,<br />\nsophomore delegate, and G. D.<br />\nPenniman, Jr., freshman delegate.<br />\nThe Council discussed a tenative<br />\nprogram of measures which it will<br />\nrecommend in fulfillment of its<br />\nduty to adjust relations between<br />\nvarious classes of students at the<br />\nUniversity. The two subjects upon<br />\nwhich it was decided to take immediate action were non-fraternity<br />\nrepresentation on the Cotillon Board<br />\nand the abolition of freshmansophomore football games.<br />\nAt present the Johns Hopkins<br />\nCotillon Uoard consists of six<br />\nmembers, each one of whom is a<br />\nrepresentative of one of the six.fraternities established at the ITniversity. There has been a growing<br />\nfeeling during the past year or two<br />\nthat the non-fraternity men, a large<br />\nnumber of whom patronized the<br />\ncotillons, should have some representation on the Board. This feeling has at length reached proportions which caused the Council to<br />\nthink that it should be recognized.<br />\n'['lie ideal condition of affairs would<br />\nbe for the cotillons to be regular<br />\nstudent activities, arranged by a<br />\n\u2022 board elected by the whole student<br />\nbody, but it was perceived that the<br />\ntransition to such a state would not<br />\nbe effected at once, and it was<br />\ntherefore decided that ill addition<br />\nto the six fraternity men on the<br />\nBoard there should be four 11011fraternity men, to be elected by the<br />\nnon-fraternity men of each of the<br />\nfour classes. F. C. Lee and H. E.<br />\nCorner were appointed a committee<br />\nto embody this decision in a recommendation and submit it to the Cotillon Board.<br />\nThe second subject taken up was<br />\nthe abolition of freshman-sopho\u2022 more football games. Because of<br />\nthe relatively small number of men<br />\nupon NVI10111 the classes can draw<br />\nfor their teams, men feel called<br />\nupon to enter these games who<br />\nhave not had the requisite amount<br />\n, of previous training, and who arc<br />\nnot fit physically Ito play so stiff a<br />\ngame as football. For this reason<br /><br />\nHopkins put up a beautiful defensive game on Saturday against<br />\nSwarthmore at Swarthmore, and<br />\nsurprised a number of followers<br />\nby holding the heavier and more<br />\nexperienced team to a 40 to 6 score.<br />\nSwarthmore outweighed the 'Varsity team twenty pounds to a man,<br />\nand taking into consideration the<br />\nexcellent record the Pennsylvania<br />\nteam has made this season, many<br />\npersons .had expected to see Hopkins overwhelmed by a score much<br />\nlarger than forty points..<br />\nCaptain Gillett and Percy Hall<br />\nwere the particular stars of the losing eleven. Gillett, at fullback,<br />\neasily outpunted McKissick, and he<br />\nmade the two field goals that were<br />\nthe only points scored by Il'opkins.<br />\nHall .made an excellent record<br />\nfor himself at right end. He ran<br />\ndown under a number of punts and<br />\nmade several. beautiful catches of<br />\nGillett's forward passes.<br />\nIn the first two quarters Hopkins failed to make a third down.<br />\nThe team could not push the heavy<br />\nopposing line for any great distances. Later, in the third period,<br />\nthe 'Varsity took a brace and the<br />\nteam manipulated the ball in better<br />\nstyle. In the last quarter the pigskin was worked downfield three<br />\ntimes within kicking distance of the<br />\ngoal posts, and two goals from field<br />\nwere made by Gillett's toe. One<br />\nwas kicked from the 40 and the<br />\nother from the 20 'yard line.<br />\nSwarthmore scored a touchdown<br />\na few minutes after the first quarter<br />\nbegan on gains made by two beautiful forward passes, one of which<br />\nwent for 20 yards.<br />\nThree touchdowns were made in<br />\nthe second period, and then the<br />\nSwarthmore coaches beg-an sending<br />\nin substitutes. The third quarter<br />\nbrought another touchdown for the<br />\nGarnets, when Clime intercepted<br />\nGillett's pass and ran half the<br />\nlength of the field to the goal.<br />\n:\\fter these three periods of scoring by the Garnet eleven, Hopkins<br />\ntook a brace and became more aggressive. The line held wonderfully well against the heavier opponents and assisted materially in<br />\nthe two sallies toward the Swarthmore goal posts that gave Gillett<br />\nhis chances to kick the field goals.<br />\nNone of the 'Varsity players was<br />\ninjured in the contest, a fact which<br />\nshows that the team was in good<br />\ncondition.<br /><br />\n(Continued on page S, col. 2.)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page S col. 3.;<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 7, col. 1.)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER, OCTOBER 28, 1912.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\n'TheApparel Oft Proclaims theMan'<br />\nTherefore: Patronize those<br /><br />\nWho study style; Who are exclusive; Who<br />\nalways have the \"latest for 'Varsity men\"<br /><br />\nJOEL GUTMAN &amp; CO.<br />\n112 to 122 NORTH EUTAW STREET<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE LAW SCHOOL<br />\n849 N.

In speaking of the Amazon women warriors, the lecturer remarked that<br />\nthey would have made capital suffragettes.<br />\nThe second lecture was on the<br />\nsubject of \"Judas Maccabaeus.\"<br />\nProfessor Abrahams traced Greek<br />\nhistory in its relation, to the Jews,<br />\ndiscussing Alexander's conquests,<br />\nand his difficulty in using the phalanx in the hills and mountain<br />\ngorges of Palestine. The contribt\\tions of the Maccabees to Jewish<br />\nhistory and the subsequent developments during the beginning of the<br />\nChristian era were discussed. The<br />\nlecture closed with an account of<br />\nthe place of Judas Maccabaeus<br />\namong the \"nine worthies\" of literature.<br />\nBoth lectures were well illustrated by lantern slides of temples,<br />\ntrated by lantern slides, adding to<br />\nthe interest of the discourses.<br /><br />\nTome Men Form Club.<br />\nFollowing the example set at other<br />\ncolleges and universities throughout the country, the Tome Institute<br />\nmen at Hopkins have formed a I.\u2014American Journal of Math metics.<br />\nTome Club.<br />\nF.

In the five remaining<br />\ngames Hopkins is expected to make<br />\na much better showing than in those<br />\nthat have been played up to the<br />\npresent time. The hardest games<br />\nare now past, and certainly to have<br />\nbeen defeated by Swarthmore and<br />\nNavy was no disgrace.<br />\nFor the past few years the games<br />\nbetwen Hopkins and Stevens have<br />\nbeen exceptionally close. Pieper<br />\nwon the game against Stevens three<br />\nyears ago by making a touchdown<br />\nafter a long run. The score was<br />\n6 to o. In 1910 Stevens won after<br />\na hard battle by the extremely close<br />\nscore of 2 to o. Last year Hopkins reversed the preceding year's<br />\nscore and defeated Stevens 2 to o.<br />\nEvery indication points to another<br />\nvery close game on Saturday.<br />\nThe Western Maryland game the<br />\nfollowing Saturday, and the St.<br />\nJohn's game a week later, should<br />\nbe well worth seeing. St. John's<br />\nhas a much better record than Hopkins so far, and the interest will<br />\nbe all the greater on that account.<br />\nFor several years past it has been<br />\nrather a foregone conclusion that<br />\nHopkins would win, and the attendance has not been as large as it<br />\nwould have been had the teams<br />\nseemed more evenly matched. It<br />\nis to be hoped that the number of<br />\npersons at the game this year will<br />\nexceed even the record-breaking<br />\nnumber of 7,000 which attended<br />\nthe game in 1909.<br />\nAs an extra attraction on Saturday, the annual class-rush between<br />\nthe sophomores and freshmen will<br />\nbe held between the halves of the<br />\nStevens football game. President<br />\nBranham of the sophomore class<br />\nwill select twenty men to represent<br />\nthe class of 1915, and President<br />\nPrimrose will do likewise in the<br />\nfreshman class. The twenty contestants on each side will have to<br />\nbe examined and passed upon by<br />\nDr. Abercrombie before they will<br />\nbe allowed to compete. The rush<br />\nwill be refereed by President C.

Those duties at bottom<br />\nall amount to one thing--the adjustment of relations between opposing classes of interests in the<br />\nUniversity. The Council has already moderated between class-officers .and class-members by undertaking .to fix the dates of class elections ; and between freshman and<br />\nsophomores by supervising the<br />\nfreshman election. But these undertakings were relatively unimportant ; in taking .up the cotillon question the council approaches for the<br />\nfirst time a matter of prime importance.<br />\nThis is not the place to go into<br />\nthe merits of the question. How<br />\nthe Council has dealt with the<br />\nsituation, and what were its reasons<br />\nfor coming to the conclusion that<br />\nit did are matters of interest and<br />\nsignificance, but after all of less<br />\ninterest and significance than the<br />\nbare fact that a duly elected representative body of students took<br />\nup the question at all. In this fact<br />\nis to be read the beginning- of a new<br />\nera at Hopkins ; an era in which<br />\nold customs will no longer be followed among the students merely<br />\nbecause they are customs, but \\yin<br />\nbe subjected by a student committee to a rigid scrutiny to see whether<br />\nthey are just, beneficial. and necessary, or merely unjust and dangerous. The Student Council has taken<br />\na step further in this direction by<br />\nrecommending the abolition of the<br />\nfreshman-sophomore football game.<br />\nThis game has long been a feature<br />\nof every season. There are many<br />\nwho will be sorry to see it go, but<br />\nexperience seems to have shown<br />\nconclusively that it is one of the<br />\nustoms which are unnecessary and<br />\ndangerous.
