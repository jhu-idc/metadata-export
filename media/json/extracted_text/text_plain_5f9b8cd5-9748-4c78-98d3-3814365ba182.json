The Baltimore Convention<br />\nCenter opened in 1979 and provides 115,000<br />\nsquare feet of exhibit and 45,000 square<br />\nfeet meeting space. Construction was<br />\nfinanced by a $35 million state bond issue<br />\nand $10 million in City funds. The Conven-<br />\ntion Center tied to the other attractions of<br />\nthe Inner Harbor, has advanced Baltimore<br />\nas a meeting place for many national and<br />\ninternational groups. A major requirement<br />\nof the convention market is an adequate<br />\nsupply of hotel rooms to meet the<br />\ndemands of the increasing number of vis-<br />\nitors. The Hyatt Regency Hotel opened in<br />\n1981 with 500 rooms and the potential for<br />\nadding 350 more. This luxury hotel is<br />\ndirectly connected to the Convention Cen-<br />\nter and Harborplace by a series of over-<br />\nhead pedestrian plazas and walkways.<br />\n<br />\nImmediately north of the Convention<br />\nCenter is the Equitable Center.

As the visitor wait-<br />\ning lines attest, the Aquarium has become<br />\na magnet which has exceeded the city\u2019s<br />\noriginal expectations. Instead of a projected<br />\n600,000 annual visitors, the facility was<br />\ntoured by 1.6 million during 1981-82, its<br />\nfirst year. Designed by Peter Chermayeff of<br />\nthe Cambridge Seven Associates, the aqua-<br />\nrium was built by the City of Baltimore for<br />\n$21.5 million. The stunning building houses<br />\n5,000 specimens of aquatic life and a tropi-<br />\ncal rain forest.<br />\n<br />\nAs the Inner Harbor project area has<br />\nexpanded, the City\u2019s attention has been<br />\ndrawn to the east along the Pratt Street<br />\nBoulevard and to Piers 4, 5 and 6 and<br />\nacross the Jones Falls to Falls Harbor. In<br />\n1981 the City erected a concert pavilion on<br />\nthe end of Pier 6. This large tent structure<br />\ncan seat over 2000 people under the can-<br />\nopy and 400 picnickers outside. Boaters<br />\nhave room to moor along the side of the<br />\npier. In 1982 canopied pedestrian bridges<br />\nlinking little Italy and the piers were com-<br />\npleted permitting easy access to harbor<br />\nattractions and parking. One of the newest<br />\nadditions, also completed in 1982, is the<br />\nrenovated, ornate Eastern Avenue Pumping<br />\nStation which houses the Department of<br />\nPublic Work\u2019s Museum. Adjacent to the<br />\npumping station is a unique sculpture<br />\ncomposed of an above-ground replica of a<br />\nstreet intersection. There, visitors can learn<br />\nof the complexities of sewers, gas lines,<br />\nstorm drains and street construction.<br />\n<br />\nBut it is the two Harborplace pavilions,<br />\nwith their shops, restaurants, and colorful<br />\nmarkets that have captured the public\u2019s<br />\nattention. The installation, at a cost of $22<br />\nmillion, has come to be the symbol of the<br />\ncomplete turnaround that has taken place<br />\nsince 1967 at the Inner Harbor. The indices<br />\nof the success of Harborplace are many:<br />\nfirst-year visits totaling 18 million; sales of a<br />\nreported $400 per square foot, or more<br />\nthan twice that in traditional shopping<br />\nmalls; over 2,000 new jobs; inclusion of the<br />\npromised high portion of minority firms<br />\namong Harborplace\u2019s 130 shops and restau-<br />\nrants, and several millions of dollars paid<br />\neach year to the City and State in taxes and<br />\nparking revenues.<br />\n<br />\nNow the Inner Harbor promenade,<br />\nalmost a mile and a half long, functions like<br />\na boardwalk tying together attractions,<br />\n<br />\nbusinesses and the many special events<br />\nalong the waterfront.<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nlssues and Problems<br />\n<br />\nAlong with the overwhelming success<br />\nof the Inner Harbor there are several issues<br />\nto be addressed. Heading the list continue<br />\nto be two problems which have confronted<br />\nBaltimore for at least 30 years, namely traf-<br />\nfic and parking. Pratt and Lombard Streets<br />\nalong the north side of the Inner Harbor<br />\nare two of the city\u2019s major traffic arteries.<br />\nImprovements to the existing street system<br />\n<br />\n* and the new 1-95 Fort McHenry harbor<br />\n<br />\ntunnel, will draw off some of the through<br />\ntraffic, especially heavy trucks, but there is<br />\nevery likelihood that Pratt, Lombard and<br />\nLight Streets will continue to carry heavy<br />\ntraffic. The City has addressed this problem<br />\nthrough the use of innovative traffic con-<br />\ntrol devices, traffic police to direct vehicles<br />\nand pedestrians at critical intersections dur-<br />\ning peak hours, and by promoting the<br />\ndevelopment of overhead walkways allow-<br />\ning visitors to reach the harbor without<br />\nconflicts with traffic. There is a widespread<br />\npublic perception that parking is inade-<br />\nquate in the Inner Harbor. While there are<br />\nover 5,000 spaces open to the public within<br />\nseveral blocks of the promenade, many<br />\npeople claim that it is difficult to find a<br />\nparking place. The actual fact is that at<br />\nnearly all times, there are hundreds of<br />\nunused parking places within several blocks<br />\nof the Harbor. The public is not always<br />\naware of those spaces, however. The City is<br />\naddressing this issue by extensive signing of<br />\nparking garages and provision of maps<br />\nshowing where parking is available.
