Though a<br />\nsong of the \"Nassau\" type is desirable, an excellent \"rag\" like<br />\n\"We've Got Sand in Our MakeUp,\" or \"We Want a Game,\" would<br />\nreceive consideration. The judges<br />\nwill of course take into considerathe facility with which the student<br />\nbody can learn a \"raggy\" composition.<br />\nAnd the yells, to stand consideration, must not be an ingenious copy<br />\nof other \"sirens\" or \"locomotives\"\u2014<br />\nthey must be original.

We need more.<br />\nThe method of awarding the<br />\nprizes will be as follows: three<br />\njudges, appointed by the Student<br />\nCouncil, will pass on the songs and<br />\nyells. The six best of both kinds<br />\nwill be printed in THE NEws-LETtrEn, and the same edition will contain a ballot to be sent to the chairman of the awarding committee.<br />\nAny subscriber to THE NEWSLETTER is entitled to one vote. The<br />\nnames of voters must be written on<br />\nthe ballot. The song and yell receiving the highest vote will win<br />\nthe prize.
