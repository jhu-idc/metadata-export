Student Council met for the first<br />\ntime this semester.<br />\nHarry Davis, after a year and a half as<br />\ntreasurer, resigned. We'll miss you, Harry.<br />\nYou did one helluva of a job.<br />\nCouncil members discussed a memorial<br />\nfund for Chris Pinto. Chris, a senior, died<br />\nover Christmas break. People who knew him<br />\nwill miss him, and people who didn't -know<br />\nhim will lament over his passing.<br />\nThe meeting moved on, and Council<br />\nPresident Maureen Freed asked if anyone<br />\nhad any new business. One person did, but<br />\nit wasn't really new business. No one knew<br />\nwhat Jon Lana was going to say, but once<br />\nhe spoke, everyone knew what he talking<br />\nabout. Almost every Council member, one<br />\ntime or another, has agreed with what Jon<br />\naddressed\u2014that Maureen is not a leader, and<br />\nas a result, Council has accomplished<br />\nnothing this year. But why has it taken so<br />\nlong for someone to confront the problem.<br />\nThe answer is communication. Few Council members communicate with each other,<br />\nand without communication, the problems<br />\nfacing Council can't be solved. And, more<br />\nimportantly, if Council members don't communicate with each other, how can the problems facing Hopkins students ever be discussed and eventually solved?<br />\nMaureen believes that Council has no major issues to address. In a recent interview,<br />\nshe said,\"The biggest thing we accomplished<br />\nwas not in regard to any specific issue. I<br />\ndon't think there are any earth shattering<br />\nquestions that students are really facing today. If there were, they would have been<br />\nwhat we gave our full energy to.\"<br />\nInstead, Maureen believes that Council's<br />\ncommunication with students is important.<br />\nIt is, but unfortunately, most of the communication has been indirect and mostly<br />\nnegative. Students won't talk to their<br />\nrepresentatives or drop sugestions into the<br />\nresponse boxes if they have no trust in Council. To be sure, communication with students<br />\nis important, but communication among<br />\nCouncil members is more important and that<br />\nwon't happen until Maureen becomes a<br />\nleader. She's the only one who can change<br />\nthe image of Council\u2014that is, if Council<br />\nmembers cooperate with her efforts to initiate the change.<br />\nWhen Maureen became president last<br />\nspring, she was unfamiliar with her role.<br />\nPrior to the election, she was not involved<br />\nin student government so she had some<br />\nlearning to do. In the past, presidents have<br />\nstayed here from May to September in order<br />\nto become familiar with their position.<br />\nMaureen elected not to. Instead, she used the<br />\nfirst semester as past presidents have used<br />\n<br />\ntheir summers. But there was a difference.<br />\n<br />\nWhile her predecessors had learned what not<br />\nto do as president during the summer,<br />\nMaureen learned what not do as president<br />\nduring the first semester.<br />\nCouncil presidents are always criticized<br />\nwhen they don't keep their election promises.<br />\nLast year, Maureen said several Council<br />\nmeetings were to be held in the Garrett<br />\nRoom, but thus far, all meetings have been<br />\nheld in Shriver Hall. Recently, Maureen has<br />\npromised that at least one meeting this<br />\nsemester will be held in the Garrett Room.<br />\nMore non-Council involvement on Council committees was another promise;<br />\nMaureen wanted other students to chair<br />\nsome committees. Currently, Council<br />\nmembers chair all committees.<br />\nBut even with Council members acting as<br />\nchairmen, most committees have accomplished little. And Council can't act on<br />\nan issue unless it's first discussed in a committee. Maureen, once again, has to make<br />\nsure that committees are running properly,<br />\nthat they are addressing the issues.<br />\nThe Career Advising Committee sponsors<br />\ncareer forums, but it can also see how our<br />\nPlacement Office compares with ones at<br />\nother universities.<br />\nThe Student Life Committee has helped<br />\nform a safety committee, but financial aid<br />\nis also an issue.<br />\nThe Communications Committee empties<br />\nthe student response boxes, but perhaps the<br />\nsuggestions should be published.<br />\nThe Social Committee sponsors dances,<br />\nbut Homewood will be alcohol free soon and<br />\nmany students won't want to stay on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe Housing Committee has had<br />\nnumerous giveaways, but numerous students<br />\nhave complained about the Housing Office.<br />\nThe Education Committee discusses TAs,<br />\ncurriculum, and everything else that has been<br />\ndiscussed during the past five years. Their<br />\ncommitment never ends.<br />\nSo the issues are there, but Council needs<br />\nsome direction. After Jon criticized Maureen<br />\nWednesday night, he asked her to list her<br />\ngoals for the semester. She named one. She<br />\npromised to spend more time with the committees, but the remainder of her reply was<br />\ngiven in textbook fashion. She complimented<br />\nJon for bringing up the problem and then<br />\napologized for not being more familiar with<br />\nher office.<br />\nMaureen must exhibit some leadership.<br />\nShe has shown an outside committee that she<br />\ndeserves a Rhodes Scholarship. But now she<br />\nhas to prove to the undergraduates of Johns<br />\nHopkins University that she deserves to be<br />\ntheir elected president.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nRemembering a Friend<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWith all of the back to school<br />\nfestivities and the upcoming<br />\nspectacles of Rush, it is difficult<br />\nto appropriately reflect upon<br />\nthe recent tragic death of Chris<br />\nPinto.<br />\nChris was definitely one of<br />\nthe most talented and humble<br />\n<br />\npeople that I have ever known.<br />\nif you were lucky enough, he<br />\nwas also one of the best friends<br />\nyou could ever have.<br />\nChris died as a result of injuries sustained while coming to<br />\nthe defense of his friend during<br />\nan incident in his hometown of<br />\nRye, New York. Chris' actions<br />\nin his passing seemed to coincide accurately with his values<br />\nin life, especially where it con-<br />\n<br />\ncerned friendship.<br />\nAs a result of a joint project<br />\nwe were working on, I twice got<br />\nthe occasion to discuss with<br />\nChris the merits of friendships.<br />\nHe spoke about how lucky he<br />\nfelt to have met and become<br />\nfriends with so many different<br />\npeople while at Hopkins, and<br />\nhe rattled off a string of names<br />\nand what was special to him<br />\nabout each person. Chris said,<br />\n<br />\n\"What really is important is the<br />\nbeginning of new friendships<br />\nand the sustaining of old ones.\"<br />\nThere is no way of describing<br />\nChris to his friends - he was<br />\nspecial to so many people in so<br />\nmany special ways that I could<br />\nnever paint as beautiful a picture as the one we hold in our<br />\nmemories for him.<br />\nBut if you ever get the<br />\nchance, listen when one of his<br />\nfriends starts talking about<br />\nhim. It has given me a chance<br />\nto learn what matters about a<br />\nperson.<br />\nIt doesn't seem to matter that<br />\nhe was extremely talented.<br />\nEveryone remembers Chris for<br />\nlittle things - the types of things<br />\nanyone could do. It didn't matter who you were, you always<br />\ngot the benefit of the doubt<br />\nfrom Chris and you could feel<br />\nthat he liked you. With that<br />\nwild grin and his hair hurting<br />\nbadly for a comb, he'd always<br />\ngo out of his way to see how<br />\nyou were doing.<br />\nIf you asked him how to get<br />\nsomewhere, he'd end up taking<br />\nyou there. I asked him what his<br />\nfavorite bars were and he took<br />\nme to them.<br />\nChris was just incredibly successful in school; it was amazing how he would never mention it. If he had his way - and<br />\nhe usually did-Chris would<br />\nget you believing that he<br />\ncouldn't do a thing.<br />\nChris spent his summers<br />\nworking at Ocean City as a<br />\nlifeguard. He loved the ocean<br />\nand he always kept his door<br />\nopen to whomever wanted to<br />\nvisit him there. Two years ago,<br />\nhe jammed just about everyone<br />\nhe knew into his apartment for<br />\na week of craziness. He didn't<br />\nhold anything back from other<br />\npeople.<br />\nIt angers all of us to be<br />\nshown so bluntly how fragile<br />\nChris' life was. We have to<br />\nkeep in mind that all of the<br />\nhard work and intensity we put<br />\ninto school is not our ticket for<br />\nimmortality.<br />\nIf there can be any good<br />\nfound in his death, it can only<br />\nbe that it has imprinted his life<br />\ndeeper into us. But I don't<br />\nthink any of us felt that would<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nhave<br />\nbeen<br />\nSomething like this should<br />\nnever happen to anybody, to<br />\nanyone's family, or to<br />\nanyone's friends.<br />\n<br />\nChris was a religious man,<br />\nand I think it would please him<br />\nif we would offer prayers for<br />\nhis family and his best friends.<br />\nI don't think any of us can imagine the hatred and sorrow we<br />\nwould feel if something like this<br />\nhappened to our brother or best<br />\nfriend.<br />\nMany people spoke of how<br />\nthey thought Chris was one of<br />\nthe best examples they could<br />\never follow.

Some<br />\nhave alleged, however, that she<br />\nhas not fulfilled all of the<br />\nqualifications enumerated by<br />\nRhodes. While Maureen has<br />\ndistinguished herself as a<br />\nscholar, as a musician, and as<br />\na leader of her peers, she has<br />\nnot, these critics aver, exhibited<br />\nthe fondness for and success in<br />\nsports called for by Rhodes. Indeed, this qualification is<br />\ngenerally held to mean participation in varsity athletics or<br />\nthe equivalent,<br />\nSurely, Maureen must have<br />\nrealized that this gap in an<br />\notherwise admirable record of<br />\nundergraduate accomplishment<br />\nwould hurt her chances of selection. Thus, she reputedly made<br />\nthe claim that she had participated as a member of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins crew club. Not<br />\nso, say members of the club,<br />\nWhile some recall that Maureen<br />\ndid attend' an organizational<br />\nmeeting, all are firm in maintaming that she did not row<br />\nregularly. It would appear then,<br />\n<br />\nthat in an attempt to enhance<br />\nher standing in the eyes of the<br />\nScholarship referees, Maureeen<br />\nmisrepresented herself with a<br />\nfalse claim. In short, she lied.<br />\nMany object to the emphasis<br />\nplaced on athletics in the<br />\nRhodes competition. They<br />\nargue that the rest of Maureen's<br />\nqualifications, all of them<br />\npresumably genuine, mark her<br />\nas deserving of a scholarship<br />\naward. Perhaps. But the<br />\nRhodes Scholarship is a private<br />\naward and may certainly set its<br />\nown terms.

Thank you for<br />\nmaking mefeel that I can learn<br />\nand for not putting me down.<br />\nI hope I can use what you<br />\ntaught me to help myself.<br />\nMoved and intrigued by this, I<br />\nnoted the time and place of the<br />\nmeeting for interested prospective tutors, and decided to go.<br />\nI had just signed up to tutor for<br />\nthe third time in the children's<br />\nprogram; I supposed that this<br />\njail program would be equally<br />\nrewarding. The more I thought<br />\nabout it, though, the more apprehensive I became about actually going into a prison and<br />\ndealing personally with people<br />\nwho had committed crimes,<br />\nperhaps violent ones. But finally I decided that it would be<br />\nvery good for me, a white girl<br />\nfrom an extremely sheltered<br />\nupper-middle<br />\nclass<br />\nbackground, to find out what<br />\nlife was like for people who had<br />\nbeen given few advantages, and<br />\nwho had turned to crime probably as a direct result of that.<br />\nSo I went to the meeting.<br />\nThe first speaker was<br />\nMichelle Young, a Hopkins<br />\nsenior who is student coordinator of the program. She<br />\ntold us that she had been tutoring since the start of the<br />\nprevious semester, and had<br />\ncontinued on her own, or with<br />\na small group of friends, over<br />\nthe summer. She spoke eloquently about the rewards of<br />\n<br />\nthe project for both tutor and<br />\nprisoner: close, personal contact with someone from a different walk of life; for tutors,<br />\nthe opportunity to help someone less fortunate and in<br />\nneed of attention and guidance<br />\nas well as academic instruction,<br />\nthe opportunity to learn about<br />\nprison life and how the people<br />\nin them deal with their environment, and the opportunity to<br />\nlearn about life and people<br />\nfrom a different perspective;<br />\nand for prisoners, the opportunity to receive attention,<br />\nguidance, and academic instruction from someone both<br />\nable and willing to give it, and,<br />\nperhaps, the opportunity to<br />\nrealize that all educated middleto-upper class people are not<br />\nnecessarily concerned only with<br />\nthemselves, but that some of<br />\nthem give generously of their<br />\ntime voluntarily. Michelle<br />\nstressed, though, that for any<br />\nof these things to _happen,<br />\ntutors must demonstrate real<br />\ncommitment by going to the jail<br />\nregularly, because the prisoners<br />\ncome to depend on the tutors,<br />\nawait their arrival eagerly, and<br />\nFeel personally betrayed if the<br />\ntutors do not come, regardless<br />\nof the reason.<br />\nThere were also educational<br />\ncoordinators from various parts<br />\nof the jail at the meeting. A<br />\nwoman from the Women's<br />\nDetention Center, where all<br />\nfemale<br />\nprisoners,<br />\nOr<br />\n\"residents\", as they are officially known, are housed,<br />\nspoke of the great need for<br />\ntutors in this badly overcrowded, understaffed section of the<br />\njail, which has no recreational<br />\nfacilities, and very limited access to reading or educational<br />\nmaterials of any sort. There<br />\nwas also a woman from the Annex, where pre-trial male<br />\nresidents are housed, who<br />\nspoke of the need for tutors to<br />\nhelp the men who are studying<br />\nfor the General Equivalency<br />\nDiploma (GED), the high<br />\nschool equivalency test, and<br />\nalso those who are not yet ready<br />\nto be thinking about the GED.<br />\nFinally, there was a man from<br />\nO'Brian House, the workrelease facility, who made a<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n0 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n1,1\u20220,<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nThe imposing prison gate overwhelms Hopkins tutors.<br />\n<br />\nsimilar plea for tutors. That<br />\nthese people had taken the time<br />\nto come to Hopkins to talk to<br />\nus made me realize that the<br />\nneed for tutors in the jail must<br />\nbe great indeed. Then Michelle<br />\nand Bill Tieffenwerth, Assistant<br />\nto the JHU Chaplain and coordinator of the project, announced that the van would be<br />\ngoing down to the Annex that<br />\nday if anyone was interested,<br />\nand a number of people, myself<br />\namong them, said that they<br />\nwere, so we went.<br />\nThe ride was brief\u2014only fifteen minutes or so\u2014but that<br />\nwas enough time for my apprehension to return. When we<br />\narrived and started walking<br />\ntowards a bleak, fortress-like<br />\nstructure with a sentry gate, I<br />\nbegan to wonder what I was<br />\ngetting myself into. I wondered<br />\nstill more when, at the entrancedesk, we had to fill out identification cards and don visitor<br />\nbadges as precautions in case of<br />\nsome sort of \"disturbance\"<br />\namong the inmates, and when<br />\nwe passed through a sliding<br />\nelectronic door of metal bars<br />\nthat clanged shut loudly behind<br />\nus as we entered the jail proper.<br />\nWe then walked for what<br />\nseemed like forever, up and<br />\ndown flights of steps, through<br />\ncorridors, past another sentry<br />\npost and another sliding door,<br />\ndown more steps, out into a<br />\ncourtyard surrounded by<br />\ncyclone fencing, past a building<br />\nfilled with young men, most of<br />\nthem black, milling about, staring at us from upper-story windows, and commenting to one<br />\nanother as we filed past, and into a trailer filled with many<br />\nmore such men. They seemed<br />\nto be waiting for us. We decided who among us would teach<br />\nreading, and who math, asked<br />\nthe men who was interested in<br />\nwhich, and split up into ten or<br />\nso groups, most with two to<br />\nfour residents per tutor.<br />\nsometimes more. We had<br />\nbrought with us some tablets<br />\nand pencils, magazines, and<br />\ntextbooks, which we divided<br />\namong ourselves.<br />\nMichelle and Bill had said at<br />\nthe meeting and in the van that<br />\nthe aim of whatever we try to<br />\nteach them should be practical,<br />\ngeared towards skills that they<br />\nwill need to use in everyday life.<br />\nIn reading, for instance,<br />\nMichelle said that there would<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nhardly be a purpose in teaching<br />\nthem about predicate adjectives. Instead, we should help<br />\nthem to become proficient at<br />\nreading newspapers and<br />\nmagazines. And in math, she<br />\nand Bill said, we should stress<br />\nthe basic arithmetic skills that<br />\nthey would need to prepare income tax returns, balance<br />\ncheckbooks, and pay bills;<br />\nalgebra is nice, said Bill, but<br />\nhardly practical for their purposes. I had elected to teach<br />\nEnglish, and my two students<br />\ndecided that they wanted to<br />\nwork on spelling, so I gave each<br />\nof them some paper and a pencil and began to ask them to<br />\nspell words.<br />\nI found that they seemed to<br />\nhave considerable problems<br />\nwith spelling relatively basic<br />\nwords, problems which were<br />\nthe result, I imagined, of their<br />\nnever seeing, only hearing,<br />\nthose words. But they seemed<br />\neager to learn and diligent, excited by the prospect of seeing<br />\non paper words that they knew<br />\nonly as sounds. One of them<br />\nwas very reserved, perhaps<br />\ntwenty-five to thirty years of<br />\nage; the other was very friendly and talkative, and looked to<br />\nme not more than eighteen. The<br />\nmajority of the people in the<br />\nAnnex seemed very young,<br />\ndefinitely under twenty-five<br />\nMy younger student would<br />\noften interrupt our lesson with<br />\nquestions directed at me. He<br />\nwanted to know as much as I<br />\nwould tell him, but he was<br />\ncareful to say that he did not<br />\nwish to make me at all uncomfortable, and that if I thought<br />\nhe was getting too personal I<br />\nshould simply say so. At one<br />\npoint he looked at me and said:<br />\n\"You're nervous, aren't<br />\nyou?\", and I had to admit, he<br />\nwas right. He was very charming, but in an almost frightening way; I was surprised at and<br />\ndisarmed by his friendliness and<br />\nopenness, and found myself<br />\nwanting to believe that he was<br />\nthe most upright young man<br />\nimaginable. This worried me a<br />\nbit because common sense told<br />\nme that I could not trust him as<br />\nfar as I could throw him. But<br />\nhe made a great point of telling<br />\nme that he thought it was<br />\nwonderful what the other tutors<br />\nand I were doing: \"You could<br />\nbe uptown doing your own<br />\nthing,\" he said, \"but you're<br />\n<br />\nnot, you're down here helping<br />\nus, and I appreciate that.\" He<br />\nreally did seem sincere about<br />\nthis, as did many of the others<br />\nwho subsequently told me the<br />\nsame sort of thing. But he<br />\nbetrayed some ambivalence at<br />\ntimes; practically the first thing<br />\nhe said to me was, \"What did<br />\nyou all do to get in here, pass<br />\na skin color test?\" And he was<br />\nincredulous that we were<br />\nvolunteers, that we actually<br />\nwanted to spend our time helping others. But I came away<br />\nfrom that first session feeling<br />\nreally elated, confident that I<br />\nwould be able to do some good<br />\nat the jail and glad of the opportunity to become less naive<br />\nabout the world and the people<br />\nin it. Every other new tutor felt<br />\nthe same way, and Michelle<br />\nsaid that she often went to<br />\ntutoring in a less-than-positive<br />\nframe of mind, but that when<br />\nshe left she was almost inevitably in good spirits, and I<br />\ndid not doubt that this would<br />\nbe true for everyone, since<br />\nthings had gone so well that<br />\nday.<br />\nThings went well for the next<br />\ntwo weeks, also. I began to<br />\ntutor a seventeen-year-old who<br />\nwas almost completely illiterate, unable to sound out the<br />\nsimplest words without great<br />\ndifficulty. I was frustrated<br />\nbecause I had no idea where to<br />\nstart with him, and received<br />\nmostly blank looks when I tried<br />\nto explain that words sound the<br />\nway they do as a direct consequence of the letters that are in<br />\nthem. But he seemed very anxious to learn to read; he kept<br />\nasking me, as he struggled with<br />\nthe first word-lists in his<br />\nprimer, \"If I finish this book,<br />\nwill I be reading?\" When I told<br />\nhim that every time he sounded out a word, he was reading,<br />\nhe smiled hesitantly, then<br />\nreturned to his list. Between the<br />\nfirst and second weeks I tutored<br />\nhim, he had done a great deal<br />\nof work on his own, and had<br />\nmade substantial progress,<br />\nwhich I think pleased me far<br />\nmore than it did him. He required my undivided attention,<br />\nwhich made things a bit difficult because I was supposed to<br />\nhe tutoring two other men as<br />\nwell, and I had to keep dashing<br />\nover to help them with the work<br />\nI had given them to do on their<br />\nown, and then returning to the<br />\nfirst young man. Most tutors<br />\nhad to do similar juggling.<br />\nOften they led miniature<br />\nclassroom sessions, lecturing at<br />\nthe blackboard to ten or more<br />\nresidents. It was exhilarating<br />\nwhen we managed to keep a<br />\nnumber of men busy with different tasks, and to give sufficient attention to all of them,<br />\nbut frustrating when we could<br />\nnot. The unbounded optimism<br />\nof the first session was beginning to subside, but we still felt<br />\nthat we were doing something<br />\neminently worthwhile.<br />\nThen, during the fourth<br />\nweek, those of us who went to<br />\nthe Annex<br />\nfound that the trailer was being<br />\nused for night GED classes, and<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER /9<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Tutors Educate Inmates<br />\ncont. flymi p. X<br />\n<br />\nthat henceforth, only two<br />\ntutors, both male, would be<br />\npermitted to go to the Annex<br />\nsince, as we were told, the<br />\ntutoring would have to be done<br />\nin the overcrowded Annex dormitory, where men might be<br />\nwalking about in an \"indecent\"<br />\nstate of dress. These, reasons<br />\nseemed to us less than satisfactory, especially since Michelle,<br />\ntold us that the previous spring<br />\nshe herself had tutored in the<br />\ndormitory and had encountered<br />\nno problems. But the population of the Annex had increased since then, and some of the<br />\nchief administrators, who saw<br />\ntutors merely as a security risk,<br />\ndid not seem to wan( us there<br />\nat all. As Bill Tieffenwerth told<br />\nme, there are \"two factions\" at<br />\nthe jail, the handful of educational counselors, and occasionally, guards and administrators as well, who applaud the Hopkins program<br />\nand do their best to assist and<br />\npromote it, and the \"nuts and<br />\nbolts\" people, who actually run<br />\nthe jail, and who \"get annoyed\" with the tutors because<br />\ntheir presence, just like the<br />\npresence of any visitor, complicates security and logistics.<br />\nThis is a shame,<br />\nBill said, because the greatest<br />\nneed for tutors is in the main<br />\nfacilities, in the Annex and in<br />\nthe Women's Center, which are<br />\nseverely overcrowded and<br />\nunderstaffed, and which need<br />\ntutors badly for those very<br />\nreasons. Ironically, those same<br />\nreasons seem to account for<br />\nmost of the resistance on the<br />\npart of the jail administrators. The one part of<br />\nthe jail in which there seems to<br />\nhe nothing but enthusiasm for<br />\n<br />\nthe Hopkins tutorial project is<br />\nO'Brian House, the workrelease facility, where many of<br />\nus have been going since they<br />\nchanged the rules regarding the<br />\nAnnex. Bill attributes the<br />\ncooperation of the people in<br />\nO'Brian to the flexible structure<br />\nand minimum security of the<br />\nprogram there, as well as to the<br />\nconcern of the educational<br />\ncoordinators. As one of those<br />\nRichard<br />\ncoordinators,<br />\nLangmead, also a work-release<br />\ncounselor at O'Brian, told me,<br />\nthe residents in the O'Brian<br />\nprogram have come into the jail<br />\nfor \"minor\", non-violent offenses, such as drunk driving.<br />\nThe work-release situation<br />\nallows them to continue working, paying bills, and so on,<br />\nwhile serving their sentences.<br />\nThe goal, he said, is to return<br />\nthese people to the community<br />\nmore able to cope with it than<br />\nthey were when they entered.<br />\nThis goal, he explained, i3 accomplished in three ways:<br />\nminimum security, treatment<br />\ndirected towards the cause of<br />\nthe person's incarceration, and<br />\nimprovement of the person,<br />\nusually through education.<br />\nLangmead told me that he<br />\nknew that Hopkins students<br />\n\u2022 were tutoring at other parts of<br />\nthe jail, and he wanted tutors at<br />\nO'Brian, so he called Bill Tieffenwerth and came to the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\norganizational<br />\n\"Perhaps they're not here<br />\nlong,\" Langmead said of the<br />\nwork-release residents, \"but if<br />\nthey can be motivated to see the<br />\nneed to improve themselves<br />\nwhile they are here, then we've<br />\n\u2022accomplished something. And<br />\nthe tutoring provided by the<br />\nHopkins students is the first<br />\nstep in that motivation pro-<br />\n<br />\ncess.\" The feedback from the<br />\nO'Brian House staff regarding<br />\nthe Hopkins tutors has been<br />\nvery good, Langmead said; the<br />\nstaff feels that there is a positive<br />\nrapport between the tutors and<br />\nthe residents. And the residents,<br />\nas far as he can tell, seem to<br />\nshare this sentiment. Langmead<br />\ngave as an example the story of<br />\na resident who was asked to go<br />\nto tutoring on different days<br />\nbut who refused because he<br />\nwanted to keep the same tutor.<br />\nHe doesn't get too many open<br />\ncompliments from residents<br />\nabout the program, Langmead<br />\nsaid, but if he did he would<br />\n\"begin to wonder what they<br />\nwere up to.\" Some of the<br />\nresidents are less-than enthusiastic about tutoring; a<br />\nman 1 tutored for five weeks<br />\nwas there because he had to be,<br />\nas part of his work-release contract, and I often sensed his<br />\nrestlessness, although he was<br />\nalways polite and periodically<br />\nseemed interested in learning.<br />\nAt O'Brian, tutoring is one-onone, and there are no security<br />\nchecks to pass through,<br />\ntherefore much constructive<br />\nwork can be done. But there are<br />\nonly thirty or forty residents<br />\n<br />\nthere at any given time, and at<br />\npresent we are tutoring fewer<br />\nthan ten of them; there are hundreds in the Annex and the<br />\nWomen's Detention Center<br />\nwhom we cannot reach at all.<br />\nSince the tutorial project at<br />\nthe jail began in 1980, it has<br />\nbecome firmly established and<br />\nseems to have a promising<br />\nThere<br />\nfuture.<br />\nwas<br />\na<br />\ntotal of about twenty-five<br />\ntutors going to various parts of<br />\nthe jail on three different days<br />\nlast fall; however, more are<br />\nalways needed.

In the unlikely event<br />\nthat the urge to burn the books<br />\nand ban the frat parties should<br />\noverpower anyone out there<br />\nthis weekend, there are two<br />\ngreat plays being produced.<br />\nOne of the plays, Waitingfor<br />\nGodot by Samuel Beckett, is a<br />\nStudio Theatre production,<br />\nutilizing minimal cast and props<br />\nto take full advantage of the<br />\n\u2022 open-ended theme of the play.<br />\nBeckett seems to deliberately<br />\nheap the play with moral contradictions to keep the observer<br />\nas ambivalent as possible about<br />\nthe overall meaning. The<br />\ndialogue and action reek of<br />\npessimistic symbolism, but<br />\ndirector Jessica Kubzansky has<br />\nchosen to emphasize the comic<br />\naspects of the situation.

When<br />\nBowie invited the crowd at Blitz<br />\nto appear in his Ashes to Ashes<br />\nvideo, Strange's new movement<br />\ngained official authority and<br />\n<br />\nthe \"new romantic\" trend was<br />\nborn.<br />\naudiences,<br />\nAmerican<br />\nhowever, still wrapped up in<br />\nJourney and Styx, rejected the<br />\nnew sound as they had done to<br />\nbunk and new wave before it.<br />\nNow, over four years later,<br />\nAmerica has discovered \"numusic\".

The title<br />\ntrack, \"Fade to Grey\", also has<br />\na familiar ring to it.

Under Japanese rule the<br />\nmany styles of Tae Kwon Do<br />\nwere suppressed. With the<br />\nliberation of Korea in 1945<br />\ncame a movement to develop<br />\nTae Kwon Do as the national<br />\nsport. By the 1960's Tae Kwon<br />\nDo began to spread around the<br />\nworld. In May 1973, the First<br />\nWorld Tae Kwon Do Championships were held in Seoul,<br />\nKorea.<br />\nIn the United States, Tae<br />\nKwon Do grew quickly during<br />\nthe 1970's. Its popularity was<br />\nspurred on by the success of<br />\n<br />\nby David Simon<br />\nLiterally translated, Tae<br />\nKwon Do, the Korean martial<br />\nart, means \"The Art of Kicking and Punching.\" Besides being a system of self-defense, it<br />\nis also an exciting fast-paced<br />\nsport, and most importantly, a<br />\nway of putting one in control of<br />\none's life.<br />\nTae Kwon Do evolved over<br />\nthousands of years.

The<br />\nfinal cycle began in 1894 with<br />\n<br />\nmartial arts movies, such as<br />\nthose of Chuck Norris and the<br />\nlate Bruce Lee. In 1975, Tae<br />\nKwon Do became an AAU<br />\nsport, holding annual national<br />\nchampionships.

Student Council met for the first<br />\ntime this semester.<br />\nHarry Davis, after a year and a half as<br />\ntreasurer, resigned. We'll miss you, Harry.<br />\nYou did one helluva of a job.<br />\nCouncil members discussed a memorial<br />\nfund for Chris Pinto. Chris, a senior, died<br />\nover Christmas break. People who knew him<br />\nwill miss him, and people who didn't -know<br />\nhim will lament over his passing.<br />\nThe meeting moved on, and Council<br />\nPresident Maureen Freed asked if anyone<br />\nhad any new business. One person did, but<br />\nit wasn't really new business. No one knew<br />\nwhat Jon Lana was going to say, but once<br />\nhe spoke, everyone knew what he talking<br />\nabout. Almost every Council member, one<br />\ntime or another, has agreed with what Jon<br />\naddressed\u2014that Maureen is not a leader, and<br />\nas a result, Council has accomplished<br />\nnothing this year. But why has it taken so<br />\nlong for someone to confront the problem.<br />\nThe answer is communication. Few Council members communicate with each other,<br />\nand without communication, the problems<br />\nfacing Council can't be solved. And, more<br />\nimportantly, if Council members don't communicate with each other, how can the problems facing Hopkins students ever be discussed and eventually solved?<br />\nMaureen believes that Council has no major issues to address. In a recent interview,<br />\nshe said,\"The biggest thing we accomplished<br />\nwas not in regard to any specific issue. I<br />\ndon't think there are any earth shattering<br />\nquestions that students are really facing today. If there were, they would have been<br />\nwhat we gave our full energy to.\"<br />\nInstead, Maureen believes that Council's<br />\ncommunication with students is important.<br />\nIt is, but unfortunately, most of the communication has been indirect and mostly<br />\nnegative. Students won't talk to their<br />\nrepresentatives or drop sugestions into the<br />\nresponse boxes if they have no trust in Council. To be sure, communication with students<br />\nis important, but communication among<br />\nCouncil members is more important and that<br />\nwon't happen until Maureen becomes a<br />\nleader. She's the only one who can change<br />\nthe image of Council\u2014that is, if Council<br />\nmembers cooperate with her efforts to initiate the change.<br />\nWhen Maureen became president last<br />\nspring, she was unfamiliar with her role.<br />\nPrior to the election, she was not involved<br />\nin student government so she had some<br />\nlearning to do. In the past, presidents have<br />\nstayed here from May to September in order<br />\nto become familiar with their position.<br />\nMaureen elected not to. Instead, she used the<br />\nfirst semester as past presidents have used<br /><br />\ntheir summers. But there was a difference.<br /><br />\nWhile her predecessors had learned what not<br />\nto do as president during the summer,<br />\nMaureen learned what not do as president<br />\nduring the first semester.<br />\nCouncil presidents are always criticized<br />\nwhen they don't keep their election promises.<br />\nLast year, Maureen said several Council<br />\nmeetings were to be held in the Garrett<br />\nRoom, but thus far, all meetings have been<br />\nheld in Shriver Hall. Recently, Maureen has<br />\npromised that at least one meeting this<br />\nsemester will be held in the Garrett Room.<br />\nMore non-Council involvement on Council committees was another promise;<br />\nMaureen wanted other students to chair<br />\nsome committees. Currently, Council<br />\nmembers chair all committees.<br />\nBut even with Council members acting as<br />\nchairmen, most committees have accomplished little. And Council can't act on<br />\nan issue unless it's first discussed in a committee. Maureen, once again, has to make<br />\nsure that committees are running properly,<br />\nthat they are addressing the issues.<br />\nThe Career Advising Committee sponsors<br />\ncareer forums, but it can also see how our<br />\nPlacement Office compares with ones at<br />\nother universities.<br />\nThe Student Life Committee has helped<br />\nform a safety committee, but financial aid<br />\nis also an issue.<br />\nThe Communications Committee empties<br />\nthe student response boxes, but perhaps the<br />\nsuggestions should be published.<br />\nThe Social Committee sponsors dances,<br />\nbut Homewood will be alcohol free soon and<br />\nmany students won't want to stay on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe Housing Committee has had<br />\nnumerous giveaways, but numerous students<br />\nhave complained about the Housing Office.<br />\nThe Education Committee discusses TAs,<br />\ncurriculum, and everything else that has been<br />\ndiscussed during the past five years. Their<br />\ncommitment never ends.<br />\nSo the issues are there, but Council needs<br />\nsome direction. After Jon criticized Maureen<br />\nWednesday night, he asked her to list her<br />\ngoals for the semester. She named one. She<br />\npromised to spend more time with the committees, but the remainder of her reply was<br />\ngiven in textbook fashion. She complimented<br />\nJon for bringing up the problem and then<br />\napologized for not being more familiar with<br />\nher office.<br />\nMaureen must exhibit some leadership.<br />\nShe has shown an outside committee that she<br />\ndeserves a Rhodes Scholarship.

Chris said,<br /><br />\n\"What really is important is the<br />\nbeginning of new friendships<br />\nand the sustaining of old ones.\"<br />\nThere is no way of describing<br />\nChris to his friends - he was<br />\nspecial to so many people in so<br />\nmany special ways that I could<br />\nnever paint as beautiful a picture as the one we hold in our<br />\nmemories for him.<br />\nBut if you ever get the<br />\nchance, listen when one of his<br />\nfriends starts talking about<br />\nhim. It has given me a chance<br />\nto learn what matters about a<br />\nperson.<br />\nIt doesn't seem to matter that<br />\nhe was extremely talented.<br />\nEveryone remembers Chris for<br />\nlittle things - the types of things<br />\nanyone could do. It didn't matter who you were, you always<br />\ngot the benefit of the doubt<br />\nfrom Chris and you could feel<br />\nthat he liked you. With that<br />\nwild grin and his hair hurting<br />\nbadly for a comb, he'd always<br />\ngo out of his way to see how<br />\nyou were doing.<br />\nIf you asked him how to get<br />\nsomewhere, he'd end up taking<br />\nyou there. I asked him what his<br />\nfavorite bars were and he took<br />\nme to them.<br />\nChris was just incredibly successful in school; it was amazing how he would never mention it. If he had his way - and<br />\nhe usually did-Chris would<br />\nget you believing that he<br />\ncouldn't do a thing.<br />\nChris spent his summers<br />\nworking at Ocean City as a<br />\nlifeguard. He loved the ocean<br />\nand he always kept his door<br />\nopen to whomever wanted to<br />\nvisit him there. Two years ago,<br />\nhe jammed just about everyone<br />\nhe knew into his apartment for<br />\na week of craziness. He didn't<br />\nhold anything back from other<br />\npeople.<br />\nIt angers all of us to be<br />\nshown so bluntly how fragile<br />\nChris' life was. We have to<br />\nkeep in mind that all of the<br />\nhard work and intensity we put<br />\ninto school is not our ticket for<br />\nimmortality.<br />\nIf there can be any good<br />\nfound in his death, it can only<br />\nbe that it has imprinted his life<br />\ndeeper into us. But I don't<br />\nthink any of us felt that would<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nhave<br />\nbeen<br />\nSomething like this should<br />\nnever happen to anybody, to<br />\nanyone's family, or to<br />\nanyone's friends.<br /><br />\nChris was a religious man,<br />\nand I think it would please him<br />\nif we would offer prayers for<br />\nhis family and his best friends.<br />\nI don't think any of us can imagine the hatred and sorrow we<br />\nwould feel if something like this<br />\nhappened to our brother or best<br />\nfriend.<br />\nMany people spoke of how<br />\nthey thought Chris was one of<br />\nthe best examples they could<br />\never follow.

Some<br />\nhave alleged, however, that she<br />\nhas not fulfilled all of the<br />\nqualifications enumerated by<br />\nRhodes. While Maureen has<br />\ndistinguished herself as a<br />\nscholar, as a musician, and as<br />\na leader of her peers, she has<br />\nnot, these critics aver, exhibited<br />\nthe fondness for and success in<br />\nsports called for by Rhodes.

The more I thought<br />\nabout it, though, the more apprehensive I became about actually going into a prison and<br />\ndealing personally with people<br />\nwho had committed crimes,<br />\nperhaps violent ones. But finally I decided that it would be<br />\nvery good for me, a white girl<br />\nfrom an extremely sheltered<br />\nupper-middle<br />\nclass<br />\nbackground, to find out what<br />\nlife was like for people who had<br />\nbeen given few advantages, and<br />\nwho had turned to crime probably as a direct result of that.<br />\nSo I went to the meeting.<br />\nThe first speaker was<br />\nMichelle Young, a Hopkins<br />\nsenior who is student coordinator of the program. She<br />\ntold us that she had been tutoring since the start of the<br />\nprevious semester, and had<br />\ncontinued on her own, or with<br />\na small group of friends, over<br />\nthe summer. She spoke eloquently about the rewards of<br /><br />\nthe project for both tutor and<br />\nprisoner: close, personal contact with someone from a different walk of life; for tutors,<br />\nthe opportunity to help someone less fortunate and in<br />\nneed of attention and guidance<br />\nas well as academic instruction,<br />\nthe opportunity to learn about<br />\nprison life and how the people<br />\nin them deal with their environment, and the opportunity to<br />\nlearn about life and people<br />\nfrom a different perspective;<br />\nand for prisoners, the opportunity to receive attention,<br />\nguidance, and academic instruction from someone both<br />\nable and willing to give it, and,<br />\nperhaps, the opportunity to<br />\nrealize that all educated middleto-upper class people are not<br />\nnecessarily concerned only with<br />\nthemselves, but that some of<br />\nthem give generously of their<br />\ntime voluntarily. Michelle<br />\nstressed, though, that for any<br />\nof these things to _happen,<br />\ntutors must demonstrate real<br />\ncommitment by going to the jail<br />\nregularly, because the prisoners<br />\ncome to depend on the tutors,<br />\nawait their arrival eagerly, and<br />\nFeel personally betrayed if the<br />\ntutors do not come, regardless<br />\nof the reason.<br />\nThere were also educational<br />\ncoordinators from various parts<br />\nof the jail at the meeting. A<br />\nwoman from the Women's<br />\nDetention Center, where all<br />\nfemale<br />\nprisoners,<br />\nOr<br />\n\"residents\", as they are officially known, are housed,<br />\nspoke of the great need for<br />\ntutors in this badly overcrowded, understaffed section of the<br />\njail, which has no recreational<br />\nfacilities, and very limited access to reading or educational<br />\nmaterials of any sort. There<br />\nwas also a woman from the Annex, where pre-trial male<br />\nresidents are housed, who<br />\nspoke of the need for tutors to<br />\nhelp the men who are studying<br />\nfor the General Equivalency<br />\nDiploma (GED), the high<br />\nschool equivalency test, and<br />\nalso those who are not yet ready<br />\nto be thinking about the GED.<br />\nFinally, there was a man from<br />\nO'Brian House, the workrelease facility, who made a<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n0 \u2022<br /><br />\n1,1\u20220,<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nThe imposing prison gate overwhelms Hopkins tutors.<br /><br />\nsimilar plea for tutors. That<br />\nthese people had taken the time<br />\nto come to Hopkins to talk to<br />\nus made me realize that the<br />\nneed for tutors in the jail must<br />\nbe great indeed. Then Michelle<br />\nand Bill Tieffenwerth, Assistant<br />\nto the JHU Chaplain and coordinator of the project, announced that the van would be<br />\ngoing down to the Annex that<br />\nday if anyone was interested,<br />\nand a number of people, myself<br />\namong them, said that they<br />\nwere, so we went.<br />\nThe ride was brief\u2014only fifteen minutes or so\u2014but that<br />\nwas enough time for my apprehension to return. When we<br />\narrived and started walking<br />\ntowards a bleak, fortress-like<br />\nstructure with a sentry gate, I<br />\nbegan to wonder what I was<br />\ngetting myself into. I wondered<br />\nstill more when, at the entrancedesk, we had to fill out identification cards and don visitor<br />\nbadges as precautions in case of<br />\nsome sort of \"disturbance\"<br />\namong the inmates, and when<br />\nwe passed through a sliding<br />\nelectronic door of metal bars<br />\nthat clanged shut loudly behind<br />\nus as we entered the jail proper.<br />\nWe then walked for what<br />\nseemed like forever, up and<br />\ndown flights of steps, through<br />\ncorridors, past another sentry<br />\npost and another sliding door,<br />\ndown more steps, out into a<br />\ncourtyard surrounded by<br />\ncyclone fencing, past a building<br />\nfilled with young men, most of<br />\nthem black, milling about, staring at us from upper-story windows, and commenting to one<br />\nanother as we filed past, and into a trailer filled with many<br />\nmore such men. They seemed<br />\nto be waiting for us. We decided who among us would teach<br />\nreading, and who math, asked<br />\nthe men who was interested in<br />\nwhich, and split up into ten or<br />\nso groups, most with two to<br />\nfour residents per tutor.<br />\nsometimes more. We had<br />\nbrought with us some tablets<br />\nand pencils, magazines, and<br />\ntextbooks, which we divided<br />\namong ourselves.<br />\nMichelle and Bill had said at<br />\nthe meeting and in the van that<br />\nthe aim of whatever we try to<br />\nteach them should be practical,<br />\ngeared towards skills that they<br />\nwill need to use in everyday life.<br />\nIn reading, for instance,<br />\nMichelle said that there would<br /><br />\nFile Photo<br /><br />\nhardly be a purpose in teaching<br />\nthem about predicate adjectives. Instead, we should help<br />\nthem to become proficient at<br />\nreading newspapers and<br />\nmagazines. And in math, she<br />\nand Bill said, we should stress<br />\nthe basic arithmetic skills that<br />\nthey would need to prepare income tax returns, balance<br />\ncheckbooks, and pay bills;<br />\nalgebra is nice, said Bill, but<br />\nhardly practical for their purposes. I had elected to teach<br />\nEnglish, and my two students<br />\ndecided that they wanted to<br />\nwork on spelling, so I gave each<br />\nof them some paper and a pencil and began to ask them to<br />\nspell words.<br />\nI found that they seemed to<br />\nhave considerable problems<br />\nwith spelling relatively basic<br />\nwords, problems which were<br />\nthe result, I imagined, of their<br />\nnever seeing, only hearing,<br />\nthose words. But they seemed<br />\neager to learn and diligent, excited by the prospect of seeing<br />\non paper words that they knew<br />\nonly as sounds. One of them<br />\nwas very reserved, perhaps<br />\ntwenty-five to thirty years of<br />\nage; the other was very friendly and talkative, and looked to<br />\nme not more than eighteen. The<br />\nmajority of the people in the<br />\nAnnex seemed very young,<br />\ndefinitely under twenty-five<br />\nMy younger student would<br />\noften interrupt our lesson with<br />\nquestions directed at me. He<br />\nwanted to know as much as I<br />\nwould tell him, but he was<br />\ncareful to say that he did not<br />\nwish to make me at all uncomfortable, and that if I thought<br />\nhe was getting too personal I<br />\nshould simply say so. At one<br />\npoint he looked at me and said:<br />\n\"You're nervous, aren't<br />\nyou?\", and I had to admit, he<br />\nwas right. He was very charming, but in an almost frightening way; I was surprised at and<br />\ndisarmed by his friendliness and<br />\nopenness, and found myself<br />\nwanting to believe that he was<br />\nthe most upright young man<br />\nimaginable. This worried me a<br />\nbit because common sense told<br />\nme that I could not trust him as<br />\nfar as I could throw him. But<br />\nhe made a great point of telling<br />\nme that he thought it was<br />\nwonderful what the other tutors<br />\nand I were doing: \"You could<br />\nbe uptown doing your own<br />\nthing,\" he said, \"but you're<br /><br />\nnot, you're down here helping<br />\nus, and I appreciate that.\" He<br />\nreally did seem sincere about<br />\nthis, as did many of the others<br />\nwho subsequently told me the<br />\nsame sort of thing. But he<br />\nbetrayed some ambivalence at<br />\ntimes; practically the first thing<br />\nhe said to me was, \"What did<br />\nyou all do to get in here, pass<br />\na skin color test?\" And he was<br />\nincredulous that we were<br />\nvolunteers, that we actually<br />\nwanted to spend our time helping others. But I came away<br />\nfrom that first session feeling<br />\nreally elated, confident that I<br />\nwould be able to do some good<br />\nat the jail and glad of the opportunity to become less naive<br />\nabout the world and the people<br />\nin it. Every other new tutor felt<br />\nthe same way, and Michelle<br />\nsaid that she often went to<br />\ntutoring in a less-than-positive<br />\nframe of mind, but that when<br />\nshe left she was almost inevitably in good spirits, and I<br />\ndid not doubt that this would<br />\nbe true for everyone, since<br />\nthings had gone so well that<br />\nday.<br />\nThings went well for the next<br />\ntwo weeks, also. I began to<br />\ntutor a seventeen-year-old who<br />\nwas almost completely illiterate, unable to sound out the<br />\nsimplest words without great<br />\ndifficulty. I was frustrated<br />\nbecause I had no idea where to<br />\nstart with him, and received<br />\nmostly blank looks when I tried<br />\nto explain that words sound the<br />\nway they do as a direct consequence of the letters that are in<br />\nthem. But he seemed very anxious to learn to read; he kept<br />\nasking me, as he struggled with<br />\nthe first word-lists in his<br />\nprimer, \"If I finish this book,<br />\nwill I be reading?\" When I told<br />\nhim that every time he sounded out a word, he was reading,<br />\nhe smiled hesitantly, then<br />\nreturned to his list. Between the<br />\nfirst and second weeks I tutored<br />\nhim, he had done a great deal<br />\nof work on his own, and had<br />\nmade substantial progress,<br />\nwhich I think pleased me far<br />\nmore than it did him. He required my undivided attention,<br />\nwhich made things a bit difficult because I was supposed to<br />\nhe tutoring two other men as<br />\nwell, and I had to keep dashing<br />\nover to help them with the work<br />\nI had given them to do on their<br />\nown, and then returning to the<br />\nfirst young man. Most tutors<br />\nhad to do similar juggling.<br />\nOften they led miniature<br />\nclassroom sessions, lecturing at<br />\nthe blackboard to ten or more<br />\nresidents. It was exhilarating<br />\nwhen we managed to keep a<br />\nnumber of men busy with different tasks, and to give sufficient attention to all of them,<br />\nbut frustrating when we could<br />\nnot. The unbounded optimism<br />\nof the first session was beginning to subside, but we still felt<br />\nthat we were doing something<br />\neminently worthwhile.<br />\nThen, during the fourth<br />\nweek, those of us who went to<br />\nthe Annex<br />\nfound that the trailer was being<br />\nused for night GED classes, and<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER /9<br /><br />\nHopkins Tutors Educate Inmates<br />\ncont. flymi p. X<br /><br />\nthat henceforth, only two<br />\ntutors, both male, would be<br />\npermitted to go to the Annex<br />\nsince, as we were told, the<br />\ntutoring would have to be done<br />\nin the overcrowded Annex dormitory, where men might be<br />\nwalking about in an \"indecent\"<br />\nstate of dress. These, reasons<br />\nseemed to us less than satisfactory, especially since Michelle,<br />\ntold us that the previous spring<br />\nshe herself had tutored in the<br />\ndormitory and had encountered<br />\nno problems. But the population of the Annex had increased since then, and some of the<br />\nchief administrators, who saw<br />\ntutors merely as a security risk,<br />\ndid not seem to wan( us there<br />\nat all. As Bill Tieffenwerth told<br />\nme, there are \"two factions\" at<br />\nthe jail, the handful of educational counselors, and occasionally, guards and administrators as well, who applaud the Hopkins program<br />\nand do their best to assist and<br />\npromote it, and the \"nuts and<br />\nbolts\" people, who actually run<br />\nthe jail, and who \"get annoyed\" with the tutors because<br />\ntheir presence, just like the<br />\npresence of any visitor, complicates security and logistics.<br />\nThis is a shame,<br />\nBill said, because the greatest<br />\nneed for tutors is in the main<br />\nfacilities, in the Annex and in<br />\nthe Women's Center, which are<br />\nseverely overcrowded and<br />\nunderstaffed, and which need<br />\ntutors badly for those very<br />\nreasons. Ironically, those same<br />\nreasons seem to account for<br />\nmost of the resistance on the<br />\npart of the jail administrators. The one part of<br />\nthe jail in which there seems to<br />\nhe nothing but enthusiasm for<br /><br />\nthe Hopkins tutorial project is<br />\nO'Brian House, the workrelease facility, where many of<br />\nus have been going since they<br />\nchanged the rules regarding the<br />\nAnnex. Bill attributes the<br />\ncooperation of the people in<br />\nO'Brian to the flexible structure<br />\nand minimum security of the<br />\nprogram there, as well as to the<br />\nconcern of the educational<br />\ncoordinators. As one of those<br />\nRichard<br />\ncoordinators,<br />\nLangmead, also a work-release<br />\ncounselor at O'Brian, told me,<br />\nthe residents in the O'Brian<br />\nprogram have come into the jail<br />\nfor \"minor\", non-violent offenses, such as drunk driving.<br />\nThe work-release situation<br />\nallows them to continue working, paying bills, and so on,<br />\nwhile serving their sentences.<br />\nThe goal, he said, is to return<br />\nthese people to the community<br />\nmore able to cope with it than<br />\nthey were when they entered.<br />\nThis goal, he explained, i3 accomplished in three ways:<br />\nminimum security, treatment<br />\ndirected towards the cause of<br />\nthe person's incarceration, and<br />\nimprovement of the person,<br />\nusually through education.<br />\nLangmead told me that he<br />\nknew that Hopkins students<br />\n\u2022 were tutoring at other parts of<br />\nthe jail, and he wanted tutors at<br />\nO'Brian, so he called Bill Tieffenwerth and came to the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\norganizational<br />\n\"Perhaps they're not here<br />\nlong,\" Langmead said of the<br />\nwork-release residents, \"but if<br />\nthey can be motivated to see the<br />\nneed to improve themselves<br />\nwhile they are here, then we've<br />\n\u2022accomplished something. And<br />\nthe tutoring provided by the<br />\nHopkins students is the first<br />\nstep in that motivation pro-<br /><br />\ncess.\" The feedback from the<br />\nO'Brian House staff regarding<br />\nthe Hopkins tutors has been<br />\nvery good, Langmead said; the<br />\nstaff feels that there is a positive<br />\nrapport between the tutors and<br />\nthe residents. And the residents,<br />\nas far as he can tell, seem to<br />\nshare this sentiment. Langmead<br />\ngave as an example the story of<br />\na resident who was asked to go<br />\nto tutoring on different days<br />\nbut who refused because he<br />\nwanted to keep the same tutor.<br />\nHe doesn't get too many open<br />\ncompliments from residents<br />\nabout the program, Langmead<br />\nsaid, but if he did he would<br />\n\"begin to wonder what they<br />\nwere up to.\" Some of the<br />\nresidents are less-than enthusiastic about tutoring; a<br />\nman 1 tutored for five weeks<br />\nwas there because he had to be,<br />\nas part of his work-release contract, and I often sensed his<br />\nrestlessness, although he was<br />\nalways polite and periodically<br />\nseemed interested in learning.<br />\nAt O'Brian, tutoring is one-onone, and there are no security<br />\nchecks to pass through,<br />\ntherefore much constructive<br />\nwork can be done. But there are<br />\nonly thirty or forty residents<br /><br />\nthere at any given time, and at<br />\npresent we are tutoring fewer<br />\nthan ten of them; there are hundreds in the Annex and the<br />\nWomen's Detention Center<br />\nwhom we cannot reach at all.<br />\nSince the tutorial project at<br />\nthe jail began in 1980, it has<br />\nbecome firmly established and<br />\nseems to have a promising<br />\nThere<br />\nfuture.<br />\nwas<br />\na<br />\ntotal of about twenty-five<br />\ntutors going to various parts of<br />\nthe jail on three different days<br />\nlast fall; however, more are<br />\nalways needed.

In the unlikely event<br />\nthat the urge to burn the books<br />\nand ban the frat parties should<br />\noverpower anyone out there<br />\nthis weekend, there are two<br />\ngreat plays being produced.<br />\nOne of the plays, Waitingfor<br />\nGodot by Samuel Beckett, is a<br />\nStudio Theatre production,<br />\nutilizing minimal cast and props<br />\nto take full advantage of the<br />\n\u2022 open-ended theme of the play.<br />\nBeckett seems to deliberately<br />\nheap the play with moral contradictions to keep the observer<br />\nas ambivalent as possible about<br />\nthe overall meaning. The<br />\ndialogue and action reek of<br />\npessimistic symbolism, but<br />\ndirector Jessica Kubzansky has<br />\nchosen to emphasize the comic<br />\naspects of the situation. One<br />\nobserver commented,\"Her interpretation is comparable to<br />\nLaurel and Hardy finding<br />\nthemselves dropped into a<br />\nmeaningful play by Beckett.\"<br />\nBut it works.

Combining Strange's unique wardrobe with a techno-dance<br />\nsound, Visage became the rage<br />\nof the British club scene. When<br />\nBowie invited the crowd at Blitz<br />\nto appear in his Ashes to Ashes<br />\nvideo, Strange's new movement<br />\ngained official authority and<br /><br />\nthe \"new romantic\" trend was<br />\nborn.<br />\naudiences,<br />\nAmerican<br />\nhowever, still wrapped up in<br />\nJourney and Styx, rejected the<br />\nnew sound as they had done to<br />\nbunk and new wave before it.<br />\nNow, over four years later,<br />\nAmerica has discovered \"numusic\".

The title<br />\ntrack, \"Fade to Grey\", also has<br />\na familiar ring to it.
