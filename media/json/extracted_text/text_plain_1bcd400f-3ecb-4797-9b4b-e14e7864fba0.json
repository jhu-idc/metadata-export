They<br />\nare: a three week refund<br />\nmechanism, a negative check-off<br />\nsystem in which the MaryPIRG<br />\nfee is already included in the<br />\nstudent fee, and a positive<br />\ncheck-off system in which a<br />\nstudent adds the MaryPIRG fee<br />\nto his tuition bill.<br />\nEasy As A Bridge<br />\nMack Lee, spokesman for the<br />\nHopkins MaryPIRG committee,<br />\npoints to the three week refund<br />\nmechanism as being the easiest<br />\nand most profitable method of<br />\ncollecting funds.<br />\n\"This method involves a<br />\n$1.50/semester increase to the<br />\nstudent fee. However, the refund<br />\nmechanism provides those<br />\nundergraduates who are not<br />\nsatisfied with the MaryPIRG<br />\norganization the option of having<br />\ntheir $1.50 refunded three weeks<br />\n<br />\nafter the beginning of each<br />\nsemester,\" said Lee.<br />\n\"MaryPIRG and the three<br />\nweek refund mechanism have<br />\nalready received widespread<br />\nstudent support on the<br />\nHomewood campus,\" Lee<br />\nexplained. \"Therefore, I feel<br />\njustified in asking the<br />\nadministration to approve this<br />\nmethod of funding,\" he added.<br />\nHowever, the administration<br />\nhas not reacted favorable towards<br />\nthe refund method, and has<br />\nsuggested the use of a positive<br />\ncheck-off system.<br />\nLarry Denton, Executive<br />\nAssistant to Homewood<br />\nVice-President George Benton,<br />\nexplained that \"a positive<br />\ncheck-off list is a more efficient<br />\nway in which to collect funds.<br />\nHaving the MaryPIRG fee on an<br />\nofficial bill gives the strong<br />\n;mplication to parents that his is<br />\nan official University fee. This is<br />\nnot what the University nor<br />\nMaryPIRG intends,: and having a<br />\npositive check-off system makes<br />\nthe purpose of a MaryPIRG fee<br />\nclear to the person paying the<br />\nbill.\"<br />\nAccording to Denton, the<br />\nUniversity would be willing to<br />\ninclude a statement along with a<br />\n<br />\nstudent's bill stating that the<br />\nMaryPIRG chapter was soliciting<br />\ncontributions from<br />\nundergraduates. Students could<br />\nthen have the option of<br />\ncontributing to the organization,<br />\nand could add that fee to their<br />\ntuition. The University would be<br />\nin charge of collecting these<br />\nfunds and would be responsible<br />\nfor turning them over to<br />\nMaryPIRG.<br />\nAt their December meeting,<br />\nhowever, the PIRG Maryland<br />\nchapters agreed that official<br />\nchapters could employ only the<br />\nthree week refund or negative<br />\ncheck -off methods. Thus,<br />\nMaryPIRG chapters with a<br />\npositive check-off system would<br />\nnot be allowed to become an<br />\nofficial chapter with voting<br />\nprivileges.<br />\nThe three week refund<br />\nmechanism provides a<br />\nsignificantly greater amount in<br />\ntotal funds, than the other<br />\nmechanisms. Using 2000 students<br />\nas a base, the three week refund<br />\nmechanism would attract<br />\napproximately 60% of the<br />\nstudents, thus raising $3600 in<br />\nfunds. The possitive check-off<br />\nsystem, however, would attract<br />\nonly 30% of the student<br />\n<br />\nrepsonsibilities and also some of<br />\nthe problems of their position,<br />\nare planned for the future.<br />\n'Firsts<br />\nThe first alternate for the<br />\nmen's dormitories is Dave Eaton,<br />\nand Steve Chang and John<br />\nHopkins are the second and third<br />\nalternatives respectively.

If the<br />\npositive check-off is approved,<br />\nthe decision to become an<br />\nunofficial MaryPIRG chapter will<br />\nthen have to be made by the<br />\nHopkins committee.<br />\n\"No course is clear for<br />\naction,\" said Lee.<br />\n<br />\nyear in an attempt to convey to<br />\nthe high school applicant a more<br />\naccurate picture of the<br />\nUniversity's social and academic<br />\nlife than has been communicated<br />\nin the past.<br />\n\"The idea of this program was<br />\nto help prospective applicants<br />\nreach an understanding of what it<br />\nreally is to be a student here,\"<br />\nRoss explained. \"I would say<br />\nthat the entire program was an<br />\noverwhelming success,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nAlong with the wither annual<br />\nactivities, the Council sponsored<br />\nthe first big brother/big sister<br />\nweek for accepted applicants.<br />\nThe two to three day period<br />\nconsisted of interviews for the<br />\napplicant with Dean of Students<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick, and Dean of<br />\nAcademic Programs Sigmund<br />\nSuskind, as well as sessions with a<br />\nFaculty Advisor.<br />\nTheir 1.,)%)<br />\nDue to limited financial and<br />\nman power re sourses, the<br />\nAdmissions Office restricted<br />\ninviations for the weekday part<br />\nof the program to their top 400<br />\nprospects.

Alternatively,<br />\ninterested students can present their suggestions at an<br />\nopen hearing to be held by the HAC on May 3, 1973, at<br />\n3 pm in Shaffer 3.<br />\nFollowing the open meeting and receipt of recommendations from the Student Council, the HAC will vote<br />\non adoption of the Code by teh Division of Arts and Sciences, and will forward its recommendations to the Administration.<br />\nCODE OF STUDENT RIGHTS AND DISCIPLINARY<br />\n<br />\nPROCEDURES<br />\nThe central purpose of the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis to pursue truth through rational inquiry and dialogue.<br />\nThe freedom to teach, to learn, and the seek new knowledge are basic rights within the University. Freedom is<br />\nnot only essential for individual members of the academic<br />\ncommunity, but it is necessary for the positive fulfillment<br />\nof the University's role in the society at large.<br />\nThe application of disciplinasry sanctions to students<br />\nis an inherently distasteful process. The establishment of<br />\nthis code is intended to ensure the integrity of the institution by clarifying standards of behavior, published in advance, and creating procedures to guarantee fair and expeditious hearings. In observing this code, the University<br />\nwill protect the interests and rights of its members, will<br />\nuphold the right of free speech and peaceful assembly<br />\nand will seek humane dispension of justice.<br />\nThe University will not intrude in the personal lives<br />\nof its students, nor will it add sanctions for unlawful behavior already dealt with by civil authority, unless it falls<br />\ninto the class of conduct described below. Moreover, since<br />\nrigid codification and relentless administration are inappropriate to an academic community, the following rules<br />\nand policy statements serve mainly to clarify violoations<br />\nof accepted norms of behavior.<br />\nREGULATIONS<br />\nMembers of the Johns Hopkins Universtiy are expected to act with considered regard for the rights and sensitivities of members of the University community and individuals in the local community. Actions which endanger<br />\nthe personal safety or security of others or their property<br />\nare regarded as particularly serious offenses. These include:<br />\n1) Physical assault, and the use or threatened use of<br />\nweapons or objects capable of being used as weapons.(No<br />\nfirearms shall be carried or stored on campus without the<br />\nexpressed, written consent of the Dean of Students.)<br />\n2) Theft or unauthorized borrowing of the belongings<br />\nof others.<br />\n3) Mishandling or appropriation of Univeristy property, such as equipment from University laboratories,<br />\ngymnasia, classrooms, lounges, and similar facilities, or the<br />\nmisappropriation of University funds.<br />\n4) Breach of agreements or contracts relating to official University acitivities or processes.<br />\n5) Illegal possession, use, or sale of drugs or liquor on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nCODE OF STUDENT RIGHTS AND DISCIPLINARY<br />\nPROCEDURES PART II<br />\nComplaints against a student enrolled in the Arts and<br />\nSciences Division of the Johns Hopkins University shall be<br />\nsubmitted in writing to the Dean of Students. Such complaints may proceed from members of the Hopkins community, the University administration, or persons unaffiliated with the University.<br />\nIndividuals, of course, have the right to bring complaints to civil authorities when applicable. While the University has the prerogative to initiate desciplinary action<br />\nagainst individuals pending action by the civil authorities,<br />\nthe policy of the University shall be to refrain from initiating similar actions while civil action is pending except:<br />\non referral of a case by civil authorities for action by the<br />\nUniversity or when circumstances of a case related to action by civil authorities vitally affect the welfare of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe Dean of Students shall determine in all cases<br />\nwhether University interests are affected by such incidents, according to the Code. The Dean of Students, in<br />\nthe process of gathering facts relevant to a case, will determine whether the case will be decided within the University, by civil authorities, whenther action is required<br />\nby oth parties, or neither. The Dean of Students shall<br />\nconsult with the accused person, informing the accused of<br />\nthe charges against him, facts known, and rights of the<br />\naccused person. If disciplinary action is necessary, the<br />\n<br />\nDean of Students shall inform the accused person of hiw<br />\nright to have his case heard before a Judicial Board or before the Dean of Students.<br />\nWhen it is determined that an alleged violation of the<br />\nCode involves clear and present danger to members of the<br />\nUniversity community or to University property, the<br />\nDean of Students may take immediate action to protect<br />\nthe security of persons and property. In such cases the<br />\naccused has the right of immediate appeal to the Appeals<br />\nBoard which shall be convened within 48 hours of notice<br />\nto review the Dean's action.<br />\nWhen the Dean of Students determines that adjudication is necessary, he shall inform the accused person of<br />\nthis decision in writing. Should the case require adjudication, the accused shall have the right to a hearing according to one of the two proceudres herein described. (1)<br />\nThe accused person may choose to have his case heard by<br />\nthe Dean of Students. (2) Or the accused person may<br />\nchoose to have his case heard by the Judicial Board,<br />\nwhereupon the Dean of Students shall immediately initiate the procedures delineated below to convene the<br />\nBoard. The choice of procedure shall be made in writing<br />\nto the Dean of Students office by the accused within a<br />\nperiod of three working days.<br />\nIn either proceudre, the hearings shall remain private,<br />\nthat is, the facts of the case shall be made known only to<br />\nthose immediately involved in the dispute and to those<br />\nhearing the case. This stipulation may, however, be waived at the discretion of the accused.<br />\nAll parties shall have the right to cousel, preferable a<br />\nmember of the Hopkins community, however, the counsel<br />\nmay not participate directly during the hearing, except in<br />\nan advisory capacity.<br />\nThe Dean of Students: 1. having been chosen by the accused person for adjudication shall continue investigation, seek testimony to ascertain facts or<br />\ninformation if necessary, and be advised of the<br />\nUniversity's responsibilities by the proper authorities. 2. shall determine the guilt of the accused<br />\nand may execute any of the following actions<br />\nwith whatever conditions that he deems necessary to an equitable conclusion: disciplinary probation, financial restitution, suspension, expulsion.<br />\n3. shall inform the complainant as well as the accused in writing of his decision.<br />\nIf the accused or the complainant is dissatisfied with<br />\nthe decision of the Dean of Students, he shall have the<br />\nright to appeal according to procedures explained below.<br />\nThe Judicial Board Procedure: I. The Judicial Board shall<br />\nbe composed of three undergraduate and two<br />\ngraduate students of the Arts and Sciences Division to be selected from a list of full-time undergraduate students and from a list of full-time<br />\ngraduate students. To determine order of service,<br />\nnames shall be matched with student identification numbers which have been randomly generated by computer by the Director of the Computer<br />\nCenter in conjunction with the Office of the<br />\nDean of Students. 2. The Office of the Dean of<br />\nStudents shall contact prospective jurors to complete a full Judicial Board. 3. Judicial Board<br />\nmembers involved in a case as the accused, as the<br />\ncomplainant, or as a witness shall not sit on the<br />\nJudicial Board for that case. 4.

Inability to serve will not preclude future service. 5.<br />\nEach Judicial Board shall serve until the disposition of one case. Upon commencement of a case,<br />\nthe Office of the Dean of Students shall notify<br />\nthe upcoming members of the Judicial Board. In<br />\nthe event that no cases are brought before the<br />\nJudicial Board, the Judicial Board shall serve until the end of the academic year. 6.

If a guilty verdict is reached, the Judicial Board shall determine whether<br />\ndisciplinary probation, financial restitution, suspension, or expulsion, shall be imposed, with<br />\nwhatever conditions that it deems necessary to<br />\nan equitable conclusion. This decision shall be<br />\ntransmitted in writing to the Dean of Students<br />\nfor implementation. The Judicial Board may consult the Dean of Students to help insure equitable implementation of the decision.<br />\nThe accused, complainant or the Dean of Students<br />\nmay appeal a Judicial Board decision to the Appeals<br />\nBoard.

For example, discussing the 10-page report's provision for plaintiff appeal after a defendent has been found innocent and the possibility of the innocent judgment's being<br />\nreversed without opportunity for further appeal, sophomore<br />\ncommittee member Diane Krasner commented, \"That's<br />\nsomething that never occurred to us.

Will the President and<br />\nthe Board have the powers to abrogate even these absurd regulations and procedures? Where does Vice President Benton,<br />\nwho oversees much of Fitzpatrick's operations, fit into the<br />\npicture? (Though Benton is not mentioned in the report,<br />\nFitzpatrick yesterday suggested that aggrieved students could<br />\nplead before Benton.)<br />\nThe whole situation surrounding the Committee on Student Rights and Disciplinary Procedures, including its report<br />\nand proposed code of conduct, is dubious.

Rather, we<br />\nhoped to presenta framework<br />\nwhich would prevent arbitrary<br />\ndecisions by the Dean of Students.<br />\nA' Dean's decision in the case of<br />\nclear and present danger on<br />\ncampus, does not involve<br />\nimmediate academic suspension or<br />\nexpulsion, but rather physical<br />\nremoval from campus. The accused<br />\nhas the right to immediate appeal<br />\nand the case must be considered<br />\nwith 48 hours. This provision of<br />\nthe code grants a new right of<br />\nappeal to students.<br />\nWithin the committee there was<br />\nconsiderable controversy over the<br />\nrights of appeal as explicated in the<br />\nreport. One area of concern was<br />\nover the incidence of<br />\ndouble-jeopardy created by the right<br />\nof appeal by the complainant or<br />\nthe Dean of Students. The feeling<br />\nof some of the committee<br />\nmembers was that an appeals<br />\nprocedure which is open to all<br />\nparties in a dispute would serve to<br />\ninsure a broader consideration of a<br />\ncase, the goal being not necessarily<br />\nan assumption of guilt or<br />\ninnocence, but rather more<br />\nequitable disposition of a dispute.<br />\nIn regard to the voting<br />\nprocedures of the Appeals Board,<br />\n3-3 ite votes would not \"preclude<br />\ndecision\", as has been stated<br />\nelsewhere. Failure for four Appeals<br />\nBoard members to agree would<br />\nreaffirm the decision of the Dean<br />\nof Students or the Judicial Board.<br />\nThe inclusion of the<br />\npen alties--disciplinary probation,<br />\nfinancial restitution, or<br />\nexpulsion\u2014in the code, was merely<br />\na recognition of the most<br />\ncommonly used disciplinary<br />\nprocedures on a college campus. In<br />\norder to avoid rigid application of<br />\nthese penalties, the committee<br />\nrecommended the right to<br />\nmodification of any of these<br />\nsanctions.<br />\nThe Homewood Advisory<br />\nCouncil has made provision for<br />\nfurther discussion of the report<br />\nthrough open hearings.<br />\nJohn Glascock<br />\nDiane Krasner<br />\nMembers, Special Committee<br />\non Student Rights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures<br />\n<br />\nthis goal and scandalously ignoring<br />\nthe rights of students has gotten<br />\nitself involved in the issues of local<br />\nand campus politics and of student<br />\nand University autonomy. Are we<br />\nthen to prevent the future<br />\nexpropriation of Campus Police<br />\nradios or are we to set up a highly<br />\nb urea cratic police state? When<br />\nreading the report I wondered why<br />\nthe members permitted themselves<br />\nto led so far astray from merely<br />\nsolving the problems at hand.<br />\nLet us first deal with this matter<br />\nof University autonomy.<br />\nAccording to the new code, any<br />\nmember of the outside community<br />\ncan bring a Hopkins student before<br />\nthe board. Why, save for this<br />\npresent neurotic concern with our<br />\nlocal image, should we permit<br />\noutsiders to prosecute University<br />\nstudents within the University for<br />\naction distasteful to the moral and<br />\nintellectual climate of St. Paul<br />\nstreet? This must remain a matter<br />\nbetween the student as a citizen<br />\nand the member of the community<br />\nas a citizen. There are courts and<br />\nnot University boards to deal with<br />\nsuch problems.<br />\nSecondly is tie provision in the<br />\ncode which allows the Dean to<br />\nsuspend students when \"an<br />\nalledged violation of the code<br />\ninvolves a clear and present danger<br />\nto the members of the University<br />\nCommunity\".

Once a person has<br />\nbeen proven innocent he or she is,<br />\nin American legal usage, innocent<br />\nand not subject to further<br />\nharassement.

The<br />\nWest Point lacrosse team will<br />\nhave to better opportunity to<br />\nrestore their pride than<br />\ntomdrrow afternoon, when the<br />\nhigh flying John's Hopkins Blue<br />\nJays migrate to the Hudson River<br />\nbluffs.<br />\nHopkins will be seeking its<br />\neighth straight victory of the<br />\nyear, but the Blue Jays cannot<br />\nafford to take the rebounding<br />\nBlack Knights too lightly. In a<br />\nsimilar sequence last. season,<br />\nArmy upset the top-ranked Terps<br />\none week after sinking at<br />\nHomewood, 13-5. With only two<br />\nkey players missing from that<br />\nsquad, Army is capable of giving<br />\nthe best a tussle.<br />\nJust As Well<br />\nCurrently ranked fifth in the<br />\nnation, the Black Knights are led<br />\nby stellar defenseman Tom<br />\nO'Leary. As a sophomore last<br />\nyear, O'Leary earned the<br />\nSchmeisser Memorial Cup, which<br />\nis awarded annually to the<br />\noutstanding defenseman playing<br />\ncollegiate lacrosse. He is<br />\ncontinuing just as well this year,<br />\nplaying in a veteran defensive<br />\ntrio. With him are seniors Bill<br />\n<br />\nHeilman and captain Tom<br />\nFitzsimmons, both of whom have<br />\nbeen starting three years for<br />\nArmy.<br />\nHopkins will also have to<br />\ncontend with senior goalie Mike<br />\nTorgerson, who was having an<br />\nexcellent year until the Maryland<br />\nfiasco. In previous games, he<br />\nturned aside 21 shots on goal<br />\nwhile holding Rutgers to a mere<br />\n4 tallies and then preserved an<br />\n8-6 win over Hofstra's talented<br />\nten with a brilliant performance.<br />\nSeeking a reprieve from last<br />\nweek, Torgerson is sure to be<br />\nready for the Blue Jays<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\nSlashed Middies<br />\nOffensively, the Black Knights<br />\nprimarily employ cutting middies<br />\nwith feeds coming from the<br />\nattack. This could be a problem<br />\nfor Hopkins, in light of the<br />\nsuccess Brown had in springing<br />\nmid-fielders free for shots. With<br />\nall-Americans Rick Goodhand<br />\nand Mike Griswold in the<br />\nmidfields, Army has proven<br />\nscoring ability at work.<br />\nGoodhand netted four of the<br />\ngoals at College Park adn is<br />\ndangerous in many situations.<br />\nThe weak link in the Army<br />\nteam appears to be the attack,<br />\nwhere inexperienced sophomores<br />\nand juniors man the posts. The<br />\nunit is gaining confidence each<br />\nweek, though, and becomes more<br />\n<br />\na threat every game.<br />\nThe biggest concern to the<br />\nBlue Jays as they leave for West<br />\nPoint today appears to be the<br />\nshoulder injuries that hamper<br />\nco-captains Jim Ferguson and Les<br />\nMatthews. Ferguson aggravated<br />\nhis separated shoulder in the<br />\nBrown game and Matthews<br />\nseverely bruised his right<br />\nshoulder on a goal-saving check<br />\nlate that same day. Both have<br />\nbeen wearing slings all week and<br />\nMatthews practiced for the first<br />\ntime yesterday. While both insist<br />\nthey can play tomorrow neither<br />\nwill approach his full<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\nThis is sure to put added<br />\npressure on the Hopkins attack<br />\nand midfields, requiring a strong<br />\ndominating effort to control the<br />\ntempo of the game and relieve<br />\nthe impaired defense.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have managed<br />\nto control games in this manner<br />\n<br />\nlatter's last contest is still in<br />\ndispute.

The<br />\nmatch held at Loyola should<br />\nhave been an easy Mason-Dixon<br />\nLeague victory for Hopkins, but<br />\nnature prevented this.

It is hoped that these<br />\n\"enthusiasts\" will reconsider the<br />\ncleverness of their actions and<br />\nreturn the goals; or at the very<br />\nleast, learn to share.<br />\nThe BIA softball compaign has<br />\nmanaged to avoid such pitfalls<br />\nthus far, and Gildersleeve and<br />\nGriffin have had to problems at<br />\nall in posting 4-0 records in the<br />\ndormitory league. With only<br />\nthree games remaining in the<br />\nfraternity and independent<br />\nleague, TEP is adding insult to<br />\nthe injury of hte 117 points<br />\noverall lead by coasting through<br />\nits first four contests.

As yet, no<br />\nserious injuries have been<br />\nreported.<br />\nIn the overall race for the team<br />\ntrophy symbolic of BIA<br />\nexcellence, Gildersleeve leads<br />\nRoyce 3441<br />\n/<br />\n2 to 330, while TEP<br />\nhas wrapped up thefraturnity<br />\nprize with 4801<br />\n/<br />\n2 points, for a 11,<br />\npoint edge over runnerup DU.<br />\n<br />\nthe Bluel Jay first singles man<br />\nand an excellent player, came<br />\ndown with the flu and was sick<br />\nfor the match on Tuesday.<br />\nBecause of a league rule which<br />\nsays that every team must place<br />\nits best players in the top spots,<br />\nHopkins had to move up all of its<br />\nperformers. The rule is designed<br />\nto prevent \"stacking,\" but in<br />\ncases like this it can be unfair.<br />\nKeeping in mind that all<br />\nsingles players faced better<br />\ncompetition than was<br />\nanticipated, and that the doubles<br />\nteams were new and somewhat<br />\nunfamiliar, the outcome was very<br />\ngood. In the first singles John<br />\nNewman lost 1-6, 2-6. Rob Fink<br />\nlost in the number two slot in<br />\nthree sets 4-6, 6-2, 3-6. Jeff<br />\nGould, playing in the third<br />\nposition, was first beaten in an<br />\n1 1 - 1 3 heartbreaker, and<br />\nproceeded to drop the second in<br />\nsix straight games. On the<br />\nbrighter side was Jeff Rosenberg,<br />\nwho won fourth singles 6-2, 7-5.<br />\nJeff has only lost one match this<br />\nyear. Rounding out the singles<br />\nmatches, fifth man Mark Unis<br />\n<br />\nwon 7-5, 6-0 and Art Israel took<br />\nthree sets to beat the number six<br />\nman 6-4, 4-6, and finally 8-6. Of<br />\nthis match, Israel said, \"I knew I<br />\nwas in trouble when I lost the<br />\nsecond set. Neither of us hit the<br />\nball very hard in the third set. It<br />\nwas a marathon 'push' match.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays were shut out in<br />\nthe doubles, as Iry Bonder and<br />\nJeff Gould dropped the first<br />\nmatch in two sets. Second pair<br />\nJohn Newman and Scott<br />\nBroffman and third doubles Gary<br />\nSwimmer and Mark Hansen also<br />\nsuccumbed, but both duos<br />\nstretched their matches to three<br />\nsets.<br />\nIf Hopkins is to retain its<br />\nMason-Dixon title the Jays will<br />\nhave to beat Loyola next time<br />\nand also top Towson State in a<br />\nmake-up game. Wednesday's<br />\nmatch with Georgetown was<br />\nrained out and will not be<br />\nre-scheduled.

They<br />\nare: a three week refund<br />\nmechanism, a negative check-off<br />\nsystem in which the MaryPIRG<br />\nfee is already included in the<br />\nstudent fee, and a positive<br />\ncheck-off system in which a<br />\nstudent adds the MaryPIRG fee<br />\nto his tuition bill.<br />\nEasy As A Bridge<br />\nMack Lee, spokesman for the<br />\nHopkins MaryPIRG committee,<br />\npoints to the three week refund<br />\nmechanism as being the easiest<br />\nand most profitable method of<br />\ncollecting funds.<br />\n\"This method involves a<br />\n$1.50/semester increase to the<br />\nstudent fee. However, the refund<br />\nmechanism provides those<br />\nundergraduates who are not<br />\nsatisfied with the MaryPIRG<br />\norganization the option of having<br />\ntheir $1.50 refunded three weeks<br /><br />\nafter the beginning of each<br />\nsemester,\" said Lee.<br />\n\"MaryPIRG and the three<br />\nweek refund mechanism have<br />\nalready received widespread<br />\nstudent support on the<br />\nHomewood campus,\" Lee<br />\nexplained. \"Therefore, I feel<br />\njustified in asking the<br />\nadministration to approve this<br />\nmethod of funding,\" he added.<br />\nHowever, the administration<br />\nhas not reacted favorable towards<br />\nthe refund method, and has<br />\nsuggested the use of a positive<br />\ncheck-off system.<br />\nLarry Denton, Executive<br />\nAssistant to Homewood<br />\nVice-President George Benton,<br />\nexplained that \"a positive<br />\ncheck-off list is a more efficient<br />\nway in which to collect funds.<br />\nHaving the MaryPIRG fee on an<br />\nofficial bill gives the strong<br />\n;mplication to parents that his is<br />\nan official University fee. This is<br />\nnot what the University nor<br />\nMaryPIRG intends,: and having a<br />\npositive check-off system makes<br />\nthe purpose of a MaryPIRG fee<br />\nclear to the person paying the<br />\nbill.\"<br />\nAccording to Denton, the<br />\nUniversity would be willing to<br />\ninclude a statement along with a<br /><br />\nstudent's bill stating that the<br />\nMaryPIRG chapter was soliciting<br />\ncontributions from<br />\nundergraduates. Students could<br />\nthen have the option of<br />\ncontributing to the organization,<br />\nand could add that fee to their<br />\ntuition. The University would be<br />\nin charge of collecting these<br />\nfunds and would be responsible<br />\nfor turning them over to<br />\nMaryPIRG.<br />\nAt their December meeting,<br />\nhowever, the PIRG Maryland<br />\nchapters agreed that official<br />\nchapters could employ only the<br />\nthree week refund or negative<br />\ncheck -off methods. Thus,<br />\nMaryPIRG chapters with a<br />\npositive check-off system would<br />\nnot be allowed to become an<br />\nofficial chapter with voting<br />\nprivileges.<br />\nThe three week refund<br />\nmechanism provides a<br />\nsignificantly greater amount in<br />\ntotal funds, than the other<br />\nmechanisms. Using 2000 students<br />\nas a base, the three week refund<br />\nmechanism would attract<br />\napproximately 60% of the<br />\nstudents, thus raising $3600 in<br />\nfunds. The possitive check-off<br />\nsystem, however, would attract<br />\nonly 30% of the student<br /><br />\nrepsonsibilities and also some of<br />\nthe problems of their position,<br />\nare planned for the future.<br />\n'Firsts<br />\nThe first alternate for the<br />\nmen's dormitories is Dave Eaton,<br />\nand Steve Chang and John<br />\nHopkins are the second and third<br />\nalternatives respectively. Esther<br />\nGiller is first alternative and<br />\nCarol Leininger the. second<br />\nalternative for the women's<br />\ndorms.<br />\nHopkins is not related to the<br />\nbenefactor of this University.<br /><br />\nbody\u2014giving a total of $1800.<br />\n\"We want the most efficient<br />\nfund-raising method possible.\"<br />\ncommented Lee. \"But more<br />\nimportant, the administrative<br />\ndecision regarding the Hopkins<br />\nMaryPIRG funding method will<br />\nno doubt influence the decisions<br />\nof other schools currently<br />\nseeking administrative approval.\"<br />\n\"The majority of MaryPIRG<br />\nfunds will come from large<br />\nschools like the University of<br />\nMaryland and Towson State.<br />\nTherefore, it is important that<br />\n.these schools be able to receive<br />\nthe best possible funding method<br />\nfrom their administrators,\"<br />\nstated Lee. \"If Hopkins gets a<br />\npositive check-off system, it<br />\nwould harm the chances of other<br />\nMaryland schools of getting the<br />\nthree week refund mechanism,\"<br />\nhe added.<br />\nAn administrative decision<br />\nregarding the positive check-off<br />\nmethod will be announced within<br />\nthe next two weeks. If the<br />\npositive check-off is approved,<br />\nthe decision to become an<br />\nunofficial MaryPIRG chapter will<br />\nthen have to be made by the<br />\nHopkins committee.<br />\n\"No course is clear for<br />\naction,\" said Lee.<br /><br />\nyear in an attempt to convey to<br />\nthe high school applicant a more<br />\naccurate picture of the<br />\nUniversity's social and academic<br />\nlife than has been communicated<br />\nin the past.<br />\n\"The idea of this program was<br />\nto help prospective applicants<br />\nreach an understanding of what it<br />\nreally is to be a student here,\"<br />\nRoss explained. \"I would say<br />\nthat the entire program was an<br />\noverwhelming success,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nAlong with the wither annual<br />\nactivities, the Council sponsored<br />\nthe first big brother/big sister<br />\nweek for accepted applicants.<br />\nThe two to three day period<br />\nconsisted of interviews for the<br />\napplicant with Dean of Students<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick, and Dean of<br />\nAcademic Programs Sigmund<br />\nSuskind, as well as sessions with a<br />\nFaculty Advisor.<br />\nTheir 1.,)%)<br />\nDue to limited financial and<br />\nman power re sourses, the<br />\nAdmissions Office restricted<br />\ninviations for the weekday part<br />\nof the program to their top 400<br />\nprospects.

Savitz commented,<br />\n\"Independent study programs<br />\ncan either be an intensive<br />\neducational experience or a<br />\nhack-off. But there are some<br />\ncourses that are hack-offs and I<br />\ndon't see any committees being<br />\nformed to get rid of them.\"<br />\nPhillips stated that the<br />\ncommittee had spent much time<br />\nstudying independent study but<br />\nremained unsure of its value.<br />\n\"I'm not sure it provides more<br />\nflexibility than the student has<br />\nnow,\" he noted.<br />\nAt Monday's open hearing for<br />\nfaculty, Phillips attributed the<br />\nlow faculty turnout to the fact<br />\nthat \"none of our<br />\nrecommendations are in any<br />\nsense revolutionary.\"<br />\nHowever, when junior David<br /><br />\nBaron commented that the draft<br />\ncontained \"virtually nothing new<br />\nbut minor technicalities,\" Phillips<br />\nsaid that the committee had<br />\ntoyed with soem novel ideas,<br />\nsuch as tutorial programs, honor<br />\ncourses, and an accelerated<br />\nthree-year program to replace the<br />\ntraditional four year program,<br />\nbut they thought it was not<br />\nfeasible at this time. The tutorial<br />\nprogram would assign one<br />\ngraduate student for two or three<br />\nundergraduates in all aspects of a<br />\ncourse's curriculum, including<br />\nlabwork.<br />\nBut committee member Dr.<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum,<br />\nPhilosophy, asserted \"The<br />\ncommittee was not of one mind.<br />\nWe can't do anything radical.

Alternatively,<br />\ninterested students can present their suggestions at an<br />\nopen hearing to be held by the HAC on May 3, 1973, at<br />\n3 pm in Shaffer 3.<br />\nFollowing the open meeting and receipt of recommendations from the Student Council, the HAC will vote<br />\non adoption of the Code by teh Division of Arts and Sciences, and will forward its recommendations to the Administration.<br />\nCODE OF STUDENT RIGHTS AND DISCIPLINARY<br /><br />\nPROCEDURES<br />\nThe central purpose of the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nis to pursue truth through rational inquiry and dialogue.<br />\nThe freedom to teach, to learn, and the seek new knowledge are basic rights within the University. Freedom is<br />\nnot only essential for individual members of the academic<br />\ncommunity, but it is necessary for the positive fulfillment<br />\nof the University's role in the society at large.<br />\nThe application of disciplinasry sanctions to students<br />\nis an inherently distasteful process. The establishment of<br />\nthis code is intended to ensure the integrity of the institution by clarifying standards of behavior, published in advance, and creating procedures to guarantee fair and expeditious hearings. In observing this code, the University<br />\nwill protect the interests and rights of its members, will<br />\nuphold the right of free speech and peaceful assembly<br />\nand will seek humane dispension of justice.<br />\nThe University will not intrude in the personal lives<br />\nof its students, nor will it add sanctions for unlawful behavior already dealt with by civil authority, unless it falls<br />\ninto the class of conduct described below. Moreover, since<br />\nrigid codification and relentless administration are inappropriate to an academic community, the following rules<br />\nand policy statements serve mainly to clarify violoations<br />\nof accepted norms of behavior.<br />\nREGULATIONS<br />\nMembers of the Johns Hopkins Universtiy are expected to act with considered regard for the rights and sensitivities of members of the University community and individuals in the local community. Actions which endanger<br />\nthe personal safety or security of others or their property<br />\nare regarded as particularly serious offenses. These include:<br />\n1) Physical assault, and the use or threatened use of<br />\nweapons or objects capable of being used as weapons.(No<br />\nfirearms shall be carried or stored on campus without the<br />\nexpressed, written consent of the Dean of Students.)<br />\n2) Theft or unauthorized borrowing of the belongings<br />\nof others.<br />\n3) Mishandling or appropriation of Univeristy property, such as equipment from University laboratories,<br />\ngymnasia, classrooms, lounges, and similar facilities, or the<br />\nmisappropriation of University funds.<br />\n4) Breach of agreements or contracts relating to official University acitivities or processes.<br />\n5) Illegal possession, use, or sale of drugs or liquor on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nCODE OF STUDENT RIGHTS AND DISCIPLINARY<br />\nPROCEDURES PART II<br />\nComplaints against a student enrolled in the Arts and<br />\nSciences Division of the Johns Hopkins University shall be<br />\nsubmitted in writing to the Dean of Students. Such complaints may proceed from members of the Hopkins community, the University administration, or persons unaffiliated with the University.<br />\nIndividuals, of course, have the right to bring complaints to civil authorities when applicable. While the University has the prerogative to initiate desciplinary action<br />\nagainst individuals pending action by the civil authorities,<br />\nthe policy of the University shall be to refrain from initiating similar actions while civil action is pending except:<br />\non referral of a case by civil authorities for action by the<br />\nUniversity or when circumstances of a case related to action by civil authorities vitally affect the welfare of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nThe Dean of Students shall determine in all cases<br />\nwhether University interests are affected by such incidents, according to the Code. The Dean of Students, in<br />\nthe process of gathering facts relevant to a case, will determine whether the case will be decided within the University, by civil authorities, whenther action is required<br />\nby oth parties, or neither. The Dean of Students shall<br />\nconsult with the accused person, informing the accused of<br />\nthe charges against him, facts known, and rights of the<br />\naccused person. If disciplinary action is necessary, the<br /><br />\nDean of Students shall inform the accused person of hiw<br />\nright to have his case heard before a Judicial Board or before the Dean of Students.<br />\nWhen it is determined that an alleged violation of the<br />\nCode involves clear and present danger to members of the<br />\nUniversity community or to University property, the<br />\nDean of Students may take immediate action to protect<br />\nthe security of persons and property. In such cases the<br />\naccused has the right of immediate appeal to the Appeals<br />\nBoard which shall be convened within 48 hours of notice<br />\nto review the Dean's action.<br />\nWhen the Dean of Students determines that adjudication is necessary, he shall inform the accused person of<br />\nthis decision in writing.

For example, discussing the 10-page report's provision for plaintiff appeal after a defendent has been found innocent and the possibility of the innocent judgment's being<br />\nreversed without opportunity for further appeal, sophomore<br />\ncommittee member Diane Krasner commented, \"That's<br />\nsomething that never occurred to us. We'd like to see that corrected.\"<br />\nDean of Students Robert Fitzpatrick, who commissioned<br />\nthe report and appointed the majority of the committee,<br />\nshould explain the rather curious relation between this report<br />\nand the near-total authority which rests in the hands of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees and the President. Will the President and<br />\nthe Board have the powers to abrogate even these absurd regulations and procedures? Where does Vice President Benton,<br />\nwho oversees much of Fitzpatrick's operations, fit into the<br />\npicture? (Though Benton is not mentioned in the report,<br />\nFitzpatrick yesterday suggested that aggrieved students could<br />\nplead before Benton.)<br />\nThe whole situation surrounding the Committee on Student Rights and Disciplinary Procedures, including its report<br />\nand proposed code of conduct, is dubious. We urge students<br />\nand faculty to read the report,- printed in full in this issue, and<br />\nto attend next week's open hearings,to demand an explanation<br />\nfor this outrage.<br /><br />\nBy ANDREW LASHLEY<br />\nCramped into two hot and<br />\nwindoless rooms below the<br />\nfreshman dorms, next to the<br />\nHopkins launderette,<br />\ncarrier-current AM radio station<br />\nWJHU broadcasts round the clock<br />\nto its potential audience of several<br />\nhundred students.<br />\nThe \"Voice of Homewood\"<br />\nfaces two , problems: despite its<br />\nofficial members'iip of 240, it has<br />\nfew listeners, and its technical<br />\nfacilities are falling apart.<br />\nThirtyish-looking Bill Gross is<br />\nWJHU's mad scientist cum Chief<br />\nEngineer, with arm in cast, horn<br />\nrimmed glasses, and hair that seems<br />\nto jump from the top of his head.<br />\nGross, who has been with the<br />\nstation four years, is the expert on<br />\nthe station's numerious<br />\ninadequacies and its few strong<br />\npoints.

Rather, we<br />\nhoped to presenta framework<br />\nwhich would prevent arbitrary<br />\ndecisions by the Dean of Students.<br />\nA' Dean's decision in the case of<br />\nclear and present danger on<br />\ncampus, does not involve<br />\nimmediate academic suspension or<br />\nexpulsion, but rather physical<br />\nremoval from campus. The accused<br />\nhas the right to immediate appeal<br />\nand the case must be considered<br />\nwith 48 hours. This provision of<br />\nthe code grants a new right of<br />\nappeal to students.<br />\nWithin the committee there was<br />\nconsiderable controversy over the<br />\nrights of appeal as explicated in the<br />\nreport. One area of concern was<br />\nover the incidence of<br />\ndouble-jeopardy created by the right<br />\nof appeal by the complainant or<br />\nthe Dean of Students. The feeling<br />\nof some of the committee<br />\nmembers was that an appeals<br />\nprocedure which is open to all<br />\nparties in a dispute would serve to<br />\ninsure a broader consideration of a<br />\ncase, the goal being not necessarily<br />\nan assumption of guilt or<br />\ninnocence, but rather more<br />\nequitable disposition of a dispute.<br />\nIn regard to the voting<br />\nprocedures of the Appeals Board,<br />\n3-3 ite votes would not \"preclude<br />\ndecision\", as has been stated<br />\nelsewhere. Failure for four Appeals<br />\nBoard members to agree would<br />\nreaffirm the decision of the Dean<br />\nof Students or the Judicial Board.<br />\nThe inclusion of the<br />\npen alties--disciplinary probation,<br />\nfinancial restitution, or<br />\nexpulsion\u2014in the code, was merely<br />\na recognition of the most<br />\ncommonly used disciplinary<br />\nprocedures on a college campus. In<br />\norder to avoid rigid application of<br />\nthese penalties, the committee<br />\nrecommended the right to<br />\nmodification of any of these<br />\nsanctions.<br />\nThe Homewood Advisory<br />\nCouncil has made provision for<br />\nfurther discussion of the report<br />\nthrough open hearings.<br />\nJohn Glascock<br />\nDiane Krasner<br />\nMembers, Special Committee<br />\non Student Rights and Disciplinary<br />\nProcedures<br /><br />\nthis goal and scandalously ignoring<br />\nthe rights of students has gotten<br />\nitself involved in the issues of local<br />\nand campus politics and of student<br />\nand University autonomy. Are we<br />\nthen to prevent the future<br />\nexpropriation of Campus Police<br />\nradios or are we to set up a highly<br />\nb urea cratic police state? When<br />\nreading the report I wondered why<br />\nthe members permitted themselves<br />\nto led so far astray from merely<br />\nsolving the problems at hand.<br />\nLet us first deal with this matter<br />\nof University autonomy.<br />\nAccording to the new code, any<br />\nmember of the outside community<br />\ncan bring a Hopkins student before<br />\nthe board. Why, save for this<br />\npresent neurotic concern with our<br />\nlocal image, should we permit<br />\noutsiders to prosecute University<br />\nstudents within the University for<br />\naction distasteful to the moral and<br />\nintellectual climate of St. Paul<br />\nstreet? This must remain a matter<br />\nbetween the student as a citizen<br />\nand the member of the community<br />\nas a citizen. There are courts and<br />\nnot University boards to deal with<br />\nsuch problems.<br />\nSecondly is tie provision in the<br />\ncode which allows the Dean to<br />\nsuspend students when \"an<br />\nalledged violation of the code<br />\ninvolves a clear and present danger<br />\nto the members of the University<br />\nCommunity\". The review board<br />\nwill not have to meet on this<br />\ndecision for at least 48 hours,<br />\npresumably a cooling off period.<br />\nThereafter we may assume that<br />\nfurther proceedings will take at<br />\nleast an additional 24 hours. Thus<br />\nthe Dean can squelch anybody or<br />\nanything that he doesn't like for<br />\nthree days, at the very least. A<br />\nclear and present danger may be<br />\nanything from a pistol held at the<br />\nDean's back to a critical article,<br />\nrare as they are, in the Newsletter.<br />\nAllowing the Dean to send the<br />\nleaders off campus can be used to<br />\nstifle a ffectively any sort of<br />\nstudent dissent.<br />\nThirdly, the conditions for<br />\nrecourse to an appeals board are<br />\nunfair to the defendent. In the<br />\nAmerican judicial system only the<br />\ndefendent may appeal. Here<br />\nhowever, the plaintiff can keep the<br />\ndefendent on trial for a protracted<br />\nperiod of time. Once a person has<br />\nbeen proven innocent he or she is,<br />\nin American legal usage, innocent<br />\nand not subject to further<br />\nharassement. On the sole basis of<br /><br />\nfairness, such an innovation is<br />\ndespicable.<br />\nConcerning the specific<br />\nviolations dealt with in the code,<br />\nthere is a need to outline what is to<br />\nbe done in the event of theft,<br />\nassault, fraud, and breech of<br />\ncontract.

I don't object to<br />\nefforts to combat these crimes, but<br />\nwe should do just that, rather than<br />\nlet the Dean use this problem as an<br />\nexcuse to increase his own domain.<br />\nA student or professor should be<br />\nable to bring a complaint about a<br />\nclearly criminal offense before the<br />\nboard.

The<br />\nWest Point lacrosse team will<br />\nhave to better opportunity to<br />\nrestore their pride than<br />\ntomdrrow afternoon, when the<br />\nhigh flying John's Hopkins Blue<br />\nJays migrate to the Hudson River<br />\nbluffs.<br />\nHopkins will be seeking its<br />\neighth straight victory of the<br />\nyear, but the Blue Jays cannot<br />\nafford to take the rebounding<br />\nBlack Knights too lightly. In a<br />\nsimilar sequence last. season,<br />\nArmy upset the top-ranked Terps<br />\none week after sinking at<br />\nHomewood, 13-5. With only two<br />\nkey players missing from that<br />\nsquad, Army is capable of giving<br />\nthe best a tussle.<br />\nJust As Well<br />\nCurrently ranked fifth in the<br />\nnation, the Black Knights are led<br />\nby stellar defenseman Tom<br />\nO'Leary. As a sophomore last<br />\nyear, O'Leary earned the<br />\nSchmeisser Memorial Cup, which<br />\nis awarded annually to the<br />\noutstanding defenseman playing<br />\ncollegiate lacrosse. He is<br />\ncontinuing just as well this year,<br />\nplaying in a veteran defensive<br />\ntrio. With him are seniors Bill<br /><br />\nHeilman and captain Tom<br />\nFitzsimmons, both of whom have<br />\nbeen starting three years for<br />\nArmy.<br />\nHopkins will also have to<br />\ncontend with senior goalie Mike<br />\nTorgerson, who was having an<br />\nexcellent year until the Maryland<br />\nfiasco. In previous games, he<br />\nturned aside 21 shots on goal<br />\nwhile holding Rutgers to a mere<br />\n4 tallies and then preserved an<br />\n8-6 win over Hofstra's talented<br />\nten with a brilliant performance.<br />\nSeeking a reprieve from last<br />\nweek, Torgerson is sure to be<br />\nready for the Blue Jays<br />\ntomorrow.<br />\nSlashed Middies<br />\nOffensively, the Black Knights<br />\nprimarily employ cutting middies<br />\nwith feeds coming from the<br />\nattack. This could be a problem<br />\nfor Hopkins, in light of the<br />\nsuccess Brown had in springing<br />\nmid-fielders free for shots. With<br />\nall-Americans Rick Goodhand<br />\nand Mike Griswold in the<br />\nmidfields, Army has proven<br />\nscoring ability at work.<br />\nGoodhand netted four of the<br />\ngoals at College Park adn is<br />\ndangerous in many situations.<br />\nThe weak link in the Army<br />\nteam appears to be the attack,<br />\nwhere inexperienced sophomores<br />\nand juniors man the posts. The<br />\nunit is gaining confidence each<br />\nweek, though, and becomes more<br /><br />\na threat every game.<br />\nThe biggest concern to the<br />\nBlue Jays as they leave for West<br />\nPoint today appears to be the<br />\nshoulder injuries that hamper<br />\nco-captains Jim Ferguson and Les<br />\nMatthews. Ferguson aggravated<br />\nhis separated shoulder in the<br />\nBrown game and Matthews<br />\nseverely bruised his right<br />\nshoulder on a goal-saving check<br />\nlate that same day. Both have<br />\nbeen wearing slings all week and<br />\nMatthews practiced for the first<br />\ntime yesterday. While both insist<br />\nthey can play tomorrow neither<br />\nwill approach his full<br />\neffectiveness.<br />\nThis is sure to put added<br />\npressure on the Hopkins attack<br />\nand midfields, requiring a strong<br />\ndominating effort to control the<br />\ntempo of the game and relieve<br />\nthe impaired defense.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have managed<br />\nto control games in this manner<br /><br />\nlatter's last contest is still in<br />\ndispute.

It is hoped that these<br />\n\"enthusiasts\" will reconsider the<br />\ncleverness of their actions and<br />\nreturn the goals; or at the very<br />\nleast, learn to share.<br />\nThe BIA softball compaign has<br />\nmanaged to avoid such pitfalls<br />\nthus far, and Gildersleeve and<br />\nGriffin have had to problems at<br />\nall in posting 4-0 records in the<br />\ndormitory league. With only<br />\nthree games remaining in the<br />\nfraternity and independent<br />\nleague, TEP is adding insult to<br />\nthe injury of hte 117 points<br />\noverall lead by coasting through<br />\nits first four contests.

The rule is designed<br />\nto prevent \"stacking,\" but in<br />\ncases like this it can be unfair.<br />\nKeeping in mind that all<br />\nsingles players faced better<br />\ncompetition than was<br />\nanticipated, and that the doubles<br />\nteams were new and somewhat<br />\nunfamiliar, the outcome was very<br />\ngood. In the first singles John<br />\nNewman lost 1-6, 2-6. Rob Fink<br />\nlost in the number two slot in<br />\nthree sets 4-6, 6-2, 3-6. Jeff<br />\nGould, playing in the third<br />\nposition, was first beaten in an<br />\n1 1 - 1 3 heartbreaker, and<br />\nproceeded to drop the second in<br />\nsix straight games. On the<br />\nbrighter side was Jeff Rosenberg,<br />\nwho won fourth singles 6-2, 7-5.<br />\nJeff has only lost one match this<br />\nyear. Rounding out the singles<br />\nmatches, fifth man Mark Unis<br /><br />\nwon 7-5, 6-0 and Art Israel took<br />\nthree sets to beat the number six<br />\nman 6-4, 4-6, and finally 8-6. Of<br />\nthis match, Israel said, \"I knew I<br />\nwas in trouble when I lost the<br />\nsecond set. Neither of us hit the<br />\nball very hard in the third set. It<br />\nwas a marathon 'push' match.\"<br />\nThe Blue Jays were shut out in<br />\nthe doubles, as Iry Bonder and<br />\nJeff Gould dropped the first<br />\nmatch in two sets.

On<br />\nWednesday, nine med school<br />\nadministrators from metropolitan<br />\nNew York's finest took their case<br />\nto Page One, Section Two of the<br />\nNew York Times.
