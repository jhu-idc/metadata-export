It was a<br />\nwildly funny and bitter and<br />\nperceptive work, something we<br />\nhigh school juniors could call our<br />\nown.

It tasted<br />\nsweetly of all sorts of meetings in<br />\nthe past. But what a rift! The<br />\nonly concrete action decided<br />\nupon, almost as an oversight, was<br />\nto set up a bridge table on<br />\ncampus between quads to collect<br />\nnames on a petition.

Currently holding an even<br />\nleague record, Hopkins will be<br />\nseeking their third straight<br />\nconference victory. WJHU will<br />\nbroadcast the game live beginning<br />\nat 2:00 p.m.<br />\nFor Dickinson, the game will<br />\nwind up a disappointing 1973<br />\nseason. The Red Devils own a<br />\ndeceptive 1-4-2 record that<br />\ncould easily be reversed given one<br />\nor two breaks a game. Among the<br />\ndefeats Dickinson has suffered is<br />\na loss to Muhlenberg by a single<br />\npoint just two weeks ago.<br />\n\"Dickinson is a team that can<br />\nbeat anyone in the conference,\"<br />\nwarned Coach Dennis Cox, \"but<br />\nthey just haven't.\" Throughout<br />\nthe season the Red Devils have<br />\nnever been out of a ball game,<br />\nand they have even given the top<br />\ncontenders a run for the money.<br />\nTwenty-four lettermen anchor<br />\n<br />\nthe 67 man squad playing for<br />\nDickinson Coach Wilbur<br />\nGobrecht. Led by captain Gene<br />\nSienkiewicz, the Red Devils will<br />\nbe trying to claim their first<br />\nvictory over Hopkins in seven<br />\nyears. Last season the Blue Jays<br />\nprevailed 55-20 here, but when<br />\nHopkins played at Carlisle two<br />\nyears ago a final minute<br />\ntouchdown and a two point<br />\nconversion were needed to<br />\nsustain the streak.<br />\nSienkiewicz heads the 5-3<br />\nDickinson defense at his line<br />\nbacking position. Backing up the<br />\nfront wall and providing pass<br />\ndefense is the job for senior<br />\nsafety Gary William and his<br />\nsupporting underclassmen.<br />\nCoach Cox considers<br />\ntomorrow's opponents to be<br />\nbetter offensively than<br />\ndefensively, with an attack much<br />\nlike the Blue Jays own. Senior<br />\nJeff Truskey is an excellent<br />\nquarterback from the Jack<br />\nThomas mold. Starting for the<br />\nthird year, Truskey runs the<br />\noption effectively and throws<br />\n<br />\nHarriers preparing<br />\nfor Invitational meet<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nWith the grueling cross country<br />\nseason drawing to a close, the<br />\nBlue Jays spent the week<br />\npreparing for the Galludet<br />\nInvitational Meet, which will be<br />\nrun tomorrow in Washington,<br />\nD.C. The invitational should be a<br />\ngood prep for next week's finale,<br />\nThe Mason-Dixon Conference<br />\nChampionships.<br />\nIn both meets the Blue Jays<br />\nwill face nearly the same<br />\nopposition and should fare well.<br />\nHopkins has already beaten<br />\nseveral of the competitors this<br />\nyear during the dual meet<br />\nschedule. However, they will face<br />\na stiff challenge from meet<br />\nfavorites; Catholic University and<br />\nMount St. Mary's.<br />\nThe 7-6 \u2022 season dual meet<br />\nrecord and the 8th place finish in<br />\nthe MAC, Hopkins' best in recent<br />\nyears, indicate good things to<br />\ncome for the Blue Jays. This<br />\nyear's squad is composed<br />\nexclusively of juniors and<br />\nfreshmen, with the exception of<br />\nsenior Captain Austin Doyle, and<br />\nall should be expected to return<br />\nfor next season.<br />\nThe MAC race itself shows the<br />\nteam's progress, avenging<br />\nmid-season losses to Franklin &<br />\nMarshall and Lebanon Valley.<br />\nWith the added experience, next<br />\nyear's squad should be prepared<br />\nto challenge for those top<br />\npositions in the conference.<br />\nAlso encouraging is the time<br />\nimprovement between the early<br />\nseason meet at Belmont Plateau<br />\nand the MAC championship on<br />\nthe same course. Schickler,<br />\nTetzlaff, Sailer and Kennedy all<br />\nshaved significant amounts off<br />\ntheir early season times.<br />\nThis pattern was apparent in<br />\nthe home meets, with most of<br />\nthe team having their best times<br />\non the course in the final home<br />\nmeet. Perhaps this puts to rest a<br />\nrecent harrier tradition of fading<br />\nwith the Fall, and indicates<br />\nbright prospects for another<br />\nseason. Further proof should be<br />\n<br />\nhad in the two remaining meets,<br />\nwhere good results should be<br />\nexpected.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense<br />\ncontinued to hold the ball on<br />\ntheir side of the field, but at the<br />\nsame time was hindered by the<br />\ninability to score.<br />\nTomorrow the Jays will travel<br />\nto Pennsylvania to compete in<br />\nthe last game of their season<br />\nagainst Widener (formerly PMC).<br />\nThe Jays record now stands at<br />\n5-5-2. It is obvious what this<br />\ngame will mean.<br />\n<br />\nwell.

Both backs<br />\ngained over 100 yards for<br />\nDickinson last week, though they<br />\nmanaged only a 21 tie.<br />\nThe Red Devil line that opens<br />\nthe holes for these backs, has its<br />\nweight concentrated at the tackle<br />\npositions, where 230 pound<br />\nfreshman Jim Reily, a converted<br />\n<br />\ncenter, joins 220 pound junior<br />\nWasyl Bojczuk. Lighter<br />\nunderclassmen compose the<br />\ninterior line, which will have the<br />\ntask of keeping co-captain<br />\nGunter Glocker and Bob<br />\nMaimone at bay.<br />\nIf the linemen hold up well,<br />\nthey will give Truskey time to<br />\nwork on his passing game, which<br />\nhas been a secondary weapon in<br />\nrecent weeks. When Truskey does<br />\ntake to the air he can choose<br />\nbetween senior tight end Pete<br />\nMoyes, sophomore slotback Jeff<br />\nMcGlaughlin, and a pair of<br />\nfreshmen, Joe Molitoris and<br />\nBernard Driscoll.<br />\nTo stop the Blue Jays, though,<br />\nDickinson will have to stop the<br />\nrapidly maturing Hopkins<br />\n<br />\ndefensive unit, that has turned in<br />\nconsistently line efforts in recent<br />\nweeks. Linemen Bruce Parker<br />\nand Ron Hall have manned the<br />\nend positions skillfully, while<br />\nMark Hetherington, Fran<br />\nWeigman, Mike O'Brien, Jim<br />\nDuffey, Keith Krantz, and Willie<br />\nOliver have been thorns all fall.<br />\nThe offense will have to play<br />\nsharper than it did last week,<br />\nhowever, for Hopkins to<br />\ncapitalize on Dickinson errors.<br />\nThe blossoming of freshmen Sam<br />\nMatz and Scott Smith add to the<br />\nthreats presented by seniors<br />\nThomas, Billy Nolan and Harry<br />\nStringer.

The score ended in a<br />\nshutout deadlock with both<br />\nteams returning to their locker<br />\nrooms scoreless after ninety<br />\nminutes of play. A new NCAA<br />\nrule allows a soccer game to end<br />\nin a knotted score as opposed to<br />\nlast year's two five-minute<br />\novertime periods.<br />\nThe Blue Jays played excellent<br />\nsoccer throughout the game.<br />\nTheir passing was the best it has<br />\nbeen all season. Their shooting<br />\ngame had something missing,<br />\nhowever. Although the Jays<br />\noutshot their opponents 26-19,<br />\nthe ball just could not find its<br />\nway into the 8' x 24' goal. On<br />\none drive, two consecutive hard<br />\nshots hit the pipe and bounded<br />\n<br />\nout of bounds. Senior Bert<br />\nArguer\u00b0 had a number of<br />\nattempted head shots but just<br />\ncouldn't find the opening to put<br />\nthe ball in. One of his shots just<br />\nmissed the top of the goal.<br />\nOffensively and defensively<br />\nthe Jays had it together,<br />\nparticularly in the defense. Most<br />\nTerror drives were accomplished<br />\nbecause of Blue Jay mistakes, but<br />\nthe defensive work of<br />\nsophomores Lou Podrazik and<br />\nJoe Rutkowski along with the<br />\nfancy footwork of the only<br />\njunior on the team, Charley<br />\n\"Chasbo\" Gilman, did not fall<br />\napart on any occasion.<br />\nHopkins nettender Keith<br />\nNaunheim kept the Terrors<br />\nscoreless but on one occasion<br />\nChasbo Gilman dropped into the<br />\nnet to play goalie as Naunheim<br />\nwas needed away from his<br />\npositipn in order to block an<br />\nattempted shot. With Naunheim<br />\nout and the ball rolling into the<br />\n<br />\nCoach Bob Oliver<br />\nunguarded net, Chasbo swiftly<br />\npulled into Naunheim's spot and<br />\n\"single-footedly\" deflected the<br />\nwould.be goal.<br />\n<br />\nBimini repeats as BIA flag football champs<br />\nThe Bimini Bay Bombers<br />\nsuccessfully defended their BIA<br />\nflag football crown Tuesday<br />\nafternoon in a convincing 18-6<br />\nconquest of TEP on the Wyman<br />\nPark field.<br />\nThe senior independents took<br />\ncommand early, scoring both<br />\ntimes they had the ball in the<br />\nfirst half while stifling the<br />\nfraternity squad with an<br />\noverwhelming defensive rush.<br />\nTom Skinner and Scott Reichard,<br />\nthe only junior Bomber,<br />\nspearheaded the Bimini pressure<br />\nthat kept TEP handcuffed most<br />\n<br />\nof the game, thwarting efforts to<br />\ndepose the champs.<br />\nBob Barbera led the Bombers<br />\noffensively, setting up the first<br />\ntouchdown and scoring the other<br />\ntwo himself. On the first Bimini<br />\nplay from scrimmage, Barbera<br />\nskirted left end for a long gainer<br />\nup the sideline. The independents<br />\ntallied on the next snap, when<br />\nDennis Gagamiros took a Tom<br />\nWilliamson lateral and hit<br />\nSkinner in the endzone.<br />\nAfter pushing TEP back again,<br />\nBimini logged another six points<br />\nwhen quarterback Williamson<br />\n<br />\nfound Barbera open in paydirt.<br />\nThe score followed John<br />\nMorrison's reception good for a<br />\nfirst down at the ten.<br />\nThe fraternity gridders<br />\nmanaged their lone touchdown<br />\nof the game in the last moments<br />\nof the half.

This progress is<br />\nbound to continue in 1974 as the<br />\nfreshman class roster is large and<br />\ntalented while only one<br />\nnationally ranked swimmer was<br />\nlost through graduation. There is<br />\nno doubt that Hopkins will have<br />\n<br />\nCoach Comfort times a swimmer's practice<br />\n<br />\nhiEws-lErrot<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nsome of the depth which was<br />\nlacking last year.<br />\nIn addition to superstars Mark<br />\nHorning and Bill Milne and the<br />\nrest of the returning veterans,<br />\nthere are fourteen freshmen,<br />\nmany of whom could make a<br />\nsubstantial contribution to the<br />\nteam this year. Comfort said of<br />\nthe team, \"It's the best and<br />\nlargest class we've ever had. We<br />\nhave to run two practice sessions<br />\nto accomodate everyone.\"<br />\nLeading the crew of well<br />\ntrained newcomers is John<br />\nPatzschke from Loyola High<br />\nSchool in Towson. He is widely<br />\nregards as one of the nation's<br />\nbest prep school swimmers of last<br />\nyear. His talent is unique in that<br />\nhe ranked as an All-American in<br />\nboth long distance and sprint<br />\nfreestyle events.<br />\n<br />\nThe increased depth of the<br />\nteam has enabled the scheduling<br />\nof nationally reputed swimming<br />\nopponents including Harvard,<br />\nOhio University, Tennessee, and<br />\nNorth Carolina State. These<br />\nteams added to the University of<br />\nMaryland, Navy and the Penn<br />\nRelays provide a challenge to the<br />\nHopkins mermen. Comfort told<br />\nthis reporter, \"We have a strong<br />\nbalanced schedule for the first<br />\ntime and it's because of our<br />\ngrowth.\"<br />\nHopkins now has a<br />\nself-perpetuating reputation in<br />\nswimming with a hard working<br />\nand dedicated team.

While this alone<br />\nwould make any coach happy,<br />\nGotwals also has some very tough<br />\nfreshmen and upper-classmen to<br />\nadd depth to the team.<br />\n\"With all of last year's men<br />\nshowing up and barring any<br />\ncrippling injuries, we should do<br />\nas well as, if not better than last<br />\nyear's 8-4 record,\" predicted<br />\nCoach Gotwals.<br />\nThe pending competition,<br />\nhowever, is better than last<br />\nyear's. Two teams that Hopkins<br />\nbeat soundly, UMBC and<br />\nWidener, have new coaches and<br />\nshould prove to be tough<br />\nopponents. Also, the addition of<br />\nGeorge Washington University<br />\nNimeloomemonimmr<br />\n<br />\nand Messiah C.ollege gives new<br />\nand challenging blood to the<br />\npresent schedule.<br />\nCurrently there are about<br />\nfourteen men practicing for the<br />\nseason. Coach Gotwals, who<br />\nwrestled here as an<br />\nundergraduate, would like more<br />\npeople to come out, undergrads<br />\nand grads alike. \"At Hopkins<br />\nwrestling and other team sports<br />\nare one of the few areas whereone<br />\ncan let his frustrations out and<br />\nalso meet new people,\" he<br />\nremarked.<br />\nThe coach is eagerly waiting<br />\nfor the advent of some football<br />\nplayers. Included in this group is<br />\nsophomore Wayne Panullo who<br />\nstarted at 177 lbs. last year.<br />\nAlso freshman Brian Coulter,<br />\nSam Matz and Jim Udell will<br />\nmove indoors. Coulter is a tough<br />\ngrappler from Wilmington<br />\nDelaware. Matz placed fourth in<br />\nBaltimore County and is<br />\n<br />\nundefeated in dual meets. Udell<br />\nplaced 7th in the New Mexico<br />\nAAAA State Tournament.<br />\nOther freshman vying for<br />\nstarting berths are Peter Bascom,<br />\nSteve Lazzaro, Robert Nadeau,<br />\nRobert Rosenwasser and Craig<br />\nSnyder. Bascom, at 150, placed<br />\n3rd in the Maryland tournament<br />\nwhile Lazzaro took 1st place in<br />\nthe 105 bracket.

While<br />\nthose three were doing well at<br />\nhome, Nadeau and Snyder were<br />\nmopping up outside the U.S.<br />\nNadeau took 1st in the Europe<br />\ntourney for U.S. Dependent<br />\nSchools and Snyder placed 2nd<br />\nin the Far East tournament.<br />\nMeanwhile upperclassmen Mel<br />\nMorse, who sat our last year, Bill<br />\nBirmingham and Greg Goldman<br />\nare looking to break into the<br />\nline-up.<br />\nReturning senior co-captains<br />\n<br />\nCHARLIE<br />\nCHAPLIN<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nNeil Hazard and Craig Stevens<br />\nwill be joined by junior Clark<br />\nKingery as team leaders this<br />\nseason.

Dean Suskind is apparently willing to abide by the twin<br />\nvotes, and we commend him too.<br />\nBut if students can take any comfort in the fact that their<br />\nvoices were heard and respected, we should take little comfort<br />\nin the fact that the policy making process precludes significant<br />\nstudent participation except in the form of belated reaction. We<br />\ndon't believe the University would be content with educating a<br />\nbunch of reactionaries, nor do we believe students have enough<br />\nof a role in deliberating over academic policies which directly<br />\naffect their academic careers.<br />\nThe events of the past two weeks (insofar as the frosh grade<br />\nconfidentiality incident is concerned) point to a severely closed<br />\nacademic policy-making process. If students are content with<br />\nthe process as it stands, so be it.. But we suggest that students<br />\nmobilize an effort to place a representative on the Academic<br />\nCouncil to prevent such an incident from ever occuring again.<br /><br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI note with sadness your<br />\naccount of the death of Cynthia<br />\nLeBoutillier on last Saturday<br />\nnight.

She was a completely<br />\nnatural person in the display of<br />\nboth her weakness and her<br />\nstrength, and like the truly<br />\nstrong, she was concious always<br />\nof the fragility that is in life, in<br />\nfriends and in herself.

I think the other side<br />\nof the story needs to be told.<br />\nThe trouble is that most<br />\npeople never see an honor<br />\ncommission trial until they are<br />\nthe subjects of them. I was a<br />\n\"defense councelor\" at one of<br />\nthose sessions last year, and I can<br />\nsay that in my 20 years, I have<br />\nnever before or since<br />\nencountered a blood -thirstier,<br />\nmore \"holier-than-thou\" group<br />\nof people than the nine panel<br />\nmembers, the recorder and the<br />\nprosecutor.<br />\nThe prosecutor went about his<br />\njob (which, incidentally, is not<br />\nsupposed to be \"prosecutor,\" as<br />\nsuch) in a style reminiscent of<br /><br />\ndeath /eaves us all shocked and<br /><br />\nevidence unfavorable to his case.<br /><br />\nbewildered, the memory of her in<br />\nlife will always be a precious one.<br />\nR.I.P.<br /><br />\nThese ersatz magistrates placed<br />\nthe burden of proof upon the<br />\ndefendant to prove his<br />\ninnocence, broke the laws of<br />\ntheir own constitution in many<br />\nways and finally came to a<br />\nverdict of guilty. Their thirst for<br />\nblood came through the clearest<br />\nwhen they fought for the<br />\nsentence. The panel wanted to<br />\nhave the convicted PLAGIARIST<br />\nexpelled from Hopkins, or fail<br />\nhim for the entire semester, or a<br />\nhost of other choice punishments.<br />\nFortunately, Dean Suskind saw<br />\nthis whole situation and<br />\ncompletely reversed the decision<br />\nof this Kangeroo Court.<br />\nI present this brief account<br />\nonly to show that the Honor<br />\nCommission provides the same<br />\nkind of security as a tree provides<br />\nin a thunderstorm. I, for one, do<br />\nnot cheat and, if ever accused, I<br />\nwould rather take my chance in a<br />\nface-to-face discussion with the<br />\nprofessor (who, I might add,<br />\nneed not 'throat' anybody for a<br />\ngrade), than be subject to the<br />\nvindictiveness of the \"Honor\"<br />\nCommission.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nJamie MacGuire<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs you know there has been<br />\nmuch discussion and confusion<br />\nconcerning the status of first<br />\nsemester grades for the classes of<br />\n'75, '76, and '77. We would like to<br />\ntake this opportunity to inform<br />\nyou of the status of these grades.<br />\nOn Tuesday, November 6th, the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies (CUS) voted that no first<br />\nsemester freshman grades will be<br />\nreleased except in the following<br />\nsituations:<br />\n1) Students applying for transfer<br />\nduring or at the end of the<br />\nfreshman year.<br />\n2) Students applying to the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University AB-MD<br />\n(2-5 Medical program.<br />\nThese first semester freshman<br />\ngrades will only be released at the<br />\nwritten request of the institution<br />\nto which the student is applying<br />\nand then only upon written<br />\nconsent of the student. The grades<br />\nfrom the first semester shall remain<br />\non file for the internal use of the<br />\ndivision of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nThere will be no other exceptions<br />\nto this rule. On Wednesday,<br />\nNovember 7th this motion was<br />\npassed unanimously by the<br />\nAcademic Council and is now in<br />\neffect.<br />\nWhile we recognize that some<br />\nstudents may be adversely affected<br />\nby this policy we feel that it was in<br />\nthe best interest of the students<br />\nand the University to remain<br />\nconsistent with the previous<br />\npolicy. At present we feel that the<br />\nfreshman grading policy is<br />\nbeneficial and we will work to see<br />\nthat it is maintained in the future.<br />\nWe would like to take this<br />\nopportunity to thank Dean<br />\nSuskind for remaining<br />\nopen-minded throughout this<br />\nwhole issue. His awareness of<br />\nstudent opinions and his concern<br />\nfor student welfare were<br />\ninstrumental in the adoption of<br />\nthis policy.<br /><br />\npro es<br /><br />\nVN.<br /><br />\nJeffrey Forman<br /><br />\nunderstand the War in Vietnam,<br />\nBy MARK BORSI<br />\nI am not normally the kind of even though they said it wasn't<br />\nperson to spread or start rumors, really a war, for years I couldn't<br />\nbut in these days when \"Repent, understand it.

Waterbed<br />\nheads.<br />\nThe article came to mind the<br />\nother day when a room-mate<br />\nfrom freshman year left for Israel<br />\nto work on a kibbutz. It was<br />\nstrange on many levels, but as<br />\nmuch as for anything, it was<br /><br />\na out the days of Colunibia<br /><br />\nwas doing was right and also that<br /><br />\nUniversity Rebellion. It was a<br />\nwildly funny and bitter and<br />\nperceptive work, something we<br />\nhigh school juniors could call our<br />\nown. Later, it was made into a<br />\nso-so movie, the action beefed up<br />\nand the locale moved to<br />\nCalifornia. Certainly, the Movie<br />\nCommittee will get around to<br />\nshowing it here someday.<br />\nAt any rate, Kunen, the 1968<br />\nradical and observer of the left<br />\nwing crystallization among his<br />\npeers, is in his mid-twenties now.<br />\nHe has a souped-up car defying<br />\nall rules of ecology, a tape deck<br />\nshutting out the rest of the<br />\nworld, and one grey hair.

We weren't<br />\nanything at fourteen or fifteen.<br />\nNot even pimply.<br />\nLet's talk about one of our<br />\nfriends this year. A sophomore.<br />\nHe mentions a complaint \u2014<br />\nsomething minor about services<br />\nat the infirmary. We suggest bold<br />\nstudent action: pickets, marches<br />\nperhaps; publicity in the papers;<br />\nletters to parents, administrators,<br />\nwhatever. Pressure, he doesn't<br />\nunderstand. What can he do,<br />\nreally? he asks.<br />\nAnd then there was the first<br />\nmeeting of the Hopkins people<br />\ninterested in impeaching<br />\nPresident Nixon. It tasted<br />\nsweetly of all sorts of meetings in<br />\nthe past. But what a rift! The<br />\nonly concrete action decided<br />\nupon, almost as an oversight, was<br />\nto set up a bridge table on<br />\ncampus between quads to collect<br />\nnames on a petition. Beyond<br /><br />\ntalk<br /><br />\nof working<br /><br />\nwith<br /><br />\ngroups. These are McGovern<br />\npeople, but that's fine. We were<br />\namong those, too.<br />\nYet, there was much bitterness<br />\ngenerated by all this talk. \"What<br />\ngood did demonstrations ever<br />\ndo?\" \"They're only self-serving<br />\nego-trips.\" \"Did they end the<br />\nwar? No!\" \"What can be<br />\naccomplished by all that stuff?\"<br />\nAlas. Two points for the kids.<br />\nWhat can we knee-jerk, arm-chair<br />\nradicals say to them? That it was<br />\na good fight?<br />\nBut some people actually did<br />\ntry to organize \u2014 not even a<br />\npicket, a boycott, or a<br />\ndemonstration \u2014just a rally. And<br />\nit fell to pieces. It was no one's<br />\nfault. Some of us tried to<br />\ncompromise with the Symposium<br />\npeople and accepted an offer to<br />\nmake a five-minute statement at<br />\nthe beginning of the question and<br />\nanswer period. This did not work<br />\nout, and thus became a classic<br />\ncase of what happens when<br />\nmomentum is peddled off for<br />\ncompromise. It was no one's<br />\nfault.<br />\nThe organizers were of the old<br />\nschool, but they were dealing<br />\nwith new school students.

Currently holding an even<br />\nleague record, Hopkins will be<br />\nseeking their third straight<br />\nconference victory. WJHU will<br />\nbroadcast the game live beginning<br />\nat 2:00 p.m.<br />\nFor Dickinson, the game will<br />\nwind up a disappointing 1973<br />\nseason. The Red Devils own a<br />\ndeceptive 1-4-2 record that<br />\ncould easily be reversed given one<br />\nor two breaks a game. Among the<br />\ndefeats Dickinson has suffered is<br />\na loss to Muhlenberg by a single<br />\npoint just two weeks ago.<br />\n\"Dickinson is a team that can<br />\nbeat anyone in the conference,\"<br />\nwarned Coach Dennis Cox, \"but<br />\nthey just haven't.\" Throughout<br />\nthe season the Red Devils have<br />\nnever been out of a ball game,<br />\nand they have even given the top<br />\ncontenders a run for the money.<br />\nTwenty-four lettermen anchor<br /><br />\nthe 67 man squad playing for<br />\nDickinson Coach Wilbur<br />\nGobrecht. Led by captain Gene<br />\nSienkiewicz, the Red Devils will<br />\nbe trying to claim their first<br />\nvictory over Hopkins in seven<br />\nyears. Last season the Blue Jays<br />\nprevailed 55-20 here, but when<br />\nHopkins played at Carlisle two<br />\nyears ago a final minute<br />\ntouchdown and a two point<br />\nconversion were needed to<br />\nsustain the streak.<br />\nSienkiewicz heads the 5-3<br />\nDickinson defense at his line<br />\nbacking position. Backing up the<br />\nfront wall and providing pass<br />\ndefense is the job for senior<br />\nsafety Gary William and his<br />\nsupporting underclassmen.<br />\nCoach Cox considers<br />\ntomorrow's opponents to be<br />\nbetter offensively than<br />\ndefensively, with an attack much<br />\nlike the Blue Jays own. Senior<br />\nJeff Truskey is an excellent<br />\nquarterback from the Jack<br />\nThomas mold. Starting for the<br />\nthird year, Truskey runs the<br />\noption effectively and throws<br /><br />\nHarriers preparing<br />\nfor Invitational meet<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nWith the grueling cross country<br />\nseason drawing to a close, the<br />\nBlue Jays spent the week<br />\npreparing for the Galludet<br />\nInvitational Meet, which will be<br />\nrun tomorrow in Washington,<br />\nD.C. The invitational should be a<br />\ngood prep for next week's finale,<br />\nThe Mason-Dixon Conference<br />\nChampionships.<br />\nIn both meets the Blue Jays<br />\nwill face nearly the same<br />\nopposition and should fare well.<br />\nHopkins has already beaten<br />\nseveral of the competitors this<br />\nyear during the dual meet<br />\nschedule. However, they will face<br />\na stiff challenge from meet<br />\nfavorites; Catholic University and<br />\nMount St. Mary's.<br />\nThe 7-6 \u2022 season dual meet<br />\nrecord and the 8th place finish in<br />\nthe MAC, Hopkins' best in recent<br />\nyears, indicate good things to<br />\ncome for the Blue Jays. This<br />\nyear's squad is composed<br />\nexclusively of juniors and<br />\nfreshmen, with the exception of<br />\nsenior Captain Austin Doyle, and<br />\nall should be expected to return<br />\nfor next season.<br />\nThe MAC race itself shows the<br />\nteam's progress, avenging<br />\nmid-season losses to Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall and Lebanon Valley.<br />\nWith the added experience, next<br />\nyear's squad should be prepared<br />\nto challenge for those top<br />\npositions in the conference.<br />\nAlso encouraging is the time<br />\nimprovement between the early<br />\nseason meet at Belmont Plateau<br />\nand the MAC championship on<br />\nthe same course. Schickler,<br />\nTetzlaff, Sailer and Kennedy all<br />\nshaved significant amounts off<br />\ntheir early season times.<br />\nThis pattern was apparent in<br />\nthe home meets, with most of<br />\nthe team having their best times<br />\non the course in the final home<br />\nmeet. Perhaps this puts to rest a<br />\nrecent harrier tradition of fading<br />\nwith the Fall, and indicates<br />\nbright prospects for another<br />\nseason. Further proof should be<br /><br />\nhad in the two remaining meets,<br />\nwhere good results should be<br />\nexpected.<br />\nThe Blue Jay offense<br />\ncontinued to hold the ball on<br />\ntheir side of the field, but at the<br />\nsame time was hindered by the<br />\ninability to score.<br />\nTomorrow the Jays will travel<br />\nto Pennsylvania to compete in<br />\nthe last game of their season<br />\nagainst Widener (formerly PMC).<br />\nThe Jays record now stands at<br />\n5-5-2. It is obvious what this<br />\ngame will mean.<br /><br />\nwell. The dangerous scrambler<br />\npicked up 80 yards last week<br />\nagainst Ursinus.<br />\nTruskey directed two time<br />\nconsuming sustained drives last<br />\nweek that were based exclusively<br />\non the Red Devil ground game.<br />\nJunior halfback Jerry Urich<br />\npresents an outside threat to the<br />\nBlue Jay defense, while Jim<br />\nGerlach, another talented<br />\nfreshman fullback, grinds out the<br />\ntough inside yardage. Both backs<br />\ngained over 100 yards for<br />\nDickinson last week, though they<br />\nmanaged only a 21 tie.<br />\nThe Red Devil line that opens<br />\nthe holes for these backs, has its<br />\nweight concentrated at the tackle<br />\npositions, where 230 pound<br />\nfreshman Jim Reily, a converted<br /><br />\ncenter, joins 220 pound junior<br />\nWasyl Bojczuk. Lighter<br />\nunderclassmen compose the<br />\ninterior line, which will have the<br />\ntask of keeping co-captain<br />\nGunter Glocker and Bob<br />\nMaimone at bay.<br />\nIf the linemen hold up well,<br />\nthey will give Truskey time to<br />\nwork on his passing game, which<br />\nhas been a secondary weapon in<br />\nrecent weeks. When Truskey does<br />\ntake to the air he can choose<br />\nbetween senior tight end Pete<br />\nMoyes, sophomore slotback Jeff<br />\nMcGlaughlin, and a pair of<br />\nfreshmen, Joe Molitoris and<br />\nBernard Driscoll.<br />\nTo stop the Blue Jays, though,<br />\nDickinson will have to stop the<br />\nrapidly maturing Hopkins<br /><br />\ndefensive unit, that has turned in<br />\nconsistently line efforts in recent<br />\nweeks. Linemen Bruce Parker<br />\nand Ron Hall have manned the<br />\nend positions skillfully, while<br />\nMark Hetherington, Fran<br />\nWeigman, Mike O'Brien, Jim<br />\nDuffey, Keith Krantz, and Willie<br />\nOliver have been thorns all fall.<br />\nThe offense will have to play<br />\nsharper than it did last week,<br />\nhowever, for Hopkins to<br />\ncapitalize on Dickinson errors.<br />\nThe blossoming of freshmen Sam<br />\nMatz and Scott Smith add to the<br />\nthreats presented by seniors<br />\nThomas, Billy Nolan and Harry<br />\nStringer. With an inspired effort<br />\nfrom the whole unit, a Blue Jay<br />\nwin ought to be within reach.<br /><br />\nBooters tie in last home game<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nsoccer team could not buy a goal<br />\nlast Tuesday afternoon when the<br />\nWestern Maryland Green Terrors<br />\n'travelled to Homewood to<br />\ncompete against the Blue Jay<br />\nbooters. The score ended in a<br />\nshutout deadlock with both<br />\nteams returning to their locker<br />\nrooms scoreless after ninety<br />\nminutes of play. A new NCAA<br />\nrule allows a soccer game to end<br />\nin a knotted score as opposed to<br />\nlast year's two five-minute<br />\novertime periods.<br />\nThe Blue Jays played excellent<br />\nsoccer throughout the game.<br />\nTheir passing was the best it has<br />\nbeen all season. Their shooting<br />\ngame had something missing,<br />\nhowever. Although the Jays<br />\noutshot their opponents 26-19,<br />\nthe ball just could not find its<br />\nway into the 8' x 24' goal. On<br />\none drive, two consecutive hard<br />\nshots hit the pipe and bounded<br /><br />\nout of bounds. Senior Bert<br />\nArguer\u00b0 had a number of<br />\nattempted head shots but just<br />\ncouldn't find the opening to put<br />\nthe ball in. One of his shots just<br />\nmissed the top of the goal.<br />\nOffensively and defensively<br />\nthe Jays had it together,<br />\nparticularly in the defense. Most<br />\nTerror drives were accomplished<br />\nbecause of Blue Jay mistakes, but<br />\nthe defensive work of<br />\nsophomores Lou Podrazik and<br />\nJoe Rutkowski along with the<br />\nfancy footwork of the only<br />\njunior on the team, Charley<br />\n\"Chasbo\" Gilman, did not fall<br />\napart on any occasion.<br />\nHopkins nettender Keith<br />\nNaunheim kept the Terrors<br />\nscoreless but on one occasion<br />\nChasbo Gilman dropped into the<br />\nnet to play goalie as Naunheim<br />\nwas needed away from his<br />\npositipn in order to block an<br />\nattempted shot. With Naunheim<br />\nout and the ball rolling into the<br /><br />\nCoach Bob Oliver<br />\nunguarded net, Chasbo swiftly<br />\npulled into Naunheim's spot and<br />\n\"single-footedly\" deflected the<br />\nwould.be goal.<br /><br />\nBimini repeats as BIA flag football champs<br />\nThe Bimini Bay Bombers<br />\nsuccessfully defended their BIA<br />\nflag football crown Tuesday<br />\nafternoon in a convincing 18-6<br />\nconquest of TEP on the Wyman<br />\nPark field.<br />\nThe senior independents took<br />\ncommand early, scoring both<br />\ntimes they had the ball in the<br />\nfirst half while stifling the<br />\nfraternity squad with an<br />\noverwhelming defensive rush.<br />\nTom Skinner and Scott Reichard,<br />\nthe only junior Bomber,<br />\nspearheaded the Bimini pressure<br />\nthat kept TEP handcuffed most<br /><br />\nof the game, thwarting efforts to<br />\ndepose the champs.<br />\nBob Barbera led the Bombers<br />\noffensively, setting up the first<br />\ntouchdown and scoring the other<br />\ntwo himself. On the first Bimini<br />\nplay from scrimmage, Barbera<br />\nskirted left end for a long gainer<br />\nup the sideline. The independents<br />\ntallied on the next snap, when<br />\nDennis Gagamiros took a Tom<br />\nWilliamson lateral and hit<br />\nSkinner in the endzone.<br />\nAfter pushing TEP back again,<br />\nBimini logged another six points<br />\nwhen quarterback Williamson<br /><br />\nfound Barbera open in paydirt.<br />\nThe score followed John<br />\nMorrison's reception good for a<br />\nfirst down at the ten.<br />\nThe fraternity gridders<br />\nmanaged their lone touchdown<br />\nof the game in the last moments<br />\nof the half.

This progress is<br />\nbound to continue in 1974 as the<br />\nfreshman class roster is large and<br />\ntalented while only one<br />\nnationally ranked swimmer was<br />\nlost through graduation. There is<br />\nno doubt that Hopkins will have<br /><br />\nCoach Comfort times a swimmer's practice<br /><br />\nhiEws-lErrot<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nsome of the depth which was<br />\nlacking last year.<br />\nIn addition to superstars Mark<br />\nHorning and Bill Milne and the<br />\nrest of the returning veterans,<br />\nthere are fourteen freshmen,<br />\nmany of whom could make a<br />\nsubstantial contribution to the<br />\nteam this year. Comfort said of<br />\nthe team, \"It's the best and<br />\nlargest class we've ever had. We<br />\nhave to run two practice sessions<br />\nto accomodate everyone.\"<br />\nLeading the crew of well<br />\ntrained newcomers is John<br />\nPatzschke from Loyola High<br />\nSchool in Towson. He is widely<br />\nregards as one of the nation's<br />\nbest prep school swimmers of last<br />\nyear. His talent is unique in that<br />\nhe ranked as an All-American in<br />\nboth long distance and sprint<br />\nfreestyle events.<br /><br />\nThe increased depth of the<br />\nteam has enabled the scheduling<br />\nof nationally reputed swimming<br />\nopponents including Harvard,<br />\nOhio University, Tennessee, and<br />\nNorth Carolina State. These<br />\nteams added to the University of<br />\nMaryland, Navy and the Penn<br />\nRelays provide a challenge to the<br />\nHopkins mermen. Comfort told<br />\nthis reporter, \"We have a strong<br />\nbalanced schedule for the first<br />\ntime and it's because of our<br />\ngrowth.\"<br />\nHopkins now has a<br />\nself-perpetuating reputation in<br />\nswimming with a hard working<br />\nand dedicated team. Many of the<br />\nswimmers practiced with<br />\nComfort or independently during<br />\nthe summer. Some of the Blue<br />\nJays even attend extra workouts<br />\nin the mornings.<br /><br />\nAll ten starters returning to Blue Jay wrestling squad<br />\nBy CAT STEVENS<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Witstling team,<br />\ncoached by Harry Gotwals,<br />\npromises to be a bright spot on<br />\nthe campus during the dreary<br />\nwinter months. The Blue Jays<br />\nhave all ten of their starters<br />\ncoming back. While this alone<br />\nwould make any coach happy,<br />\nGotwals also has some very tough<br />\nfreshmen and upper-classmen to<br />\nadd depth to the team.<br />\n\"With all of last year's men<br />\nshowing up and barring any<br />\ncrippling injuries, we should do<br />\nas well as, if not better than last<br />\nyear's 8-4 record,\" predicted<br />\nCoach Gotwals.<br />\nThe pending competition,<br />\nhowever, is better than last<br />\nyear's. Two teams that Hopkins<br />\nbeat soundly, UMBC and<br />\nWidener, have new coaches and<br />\nshould prove to be tough<br />\nopponents. Also, the addition of<br />\nGeorge Washington University<br />\nNimeloomemonimmr<br /><br />\nand Messiah C.ollege gives new<br />\nand challenging blood to the<br />\npresent schedule.<br />\nCurrently there are about<br />\nfourteen men practicing for the<br />\nseason. Coach Gotwals, who<br />\nwrestled here as an<br />\nundergraduate, would like more<br />\npeople to come out, undergrads<br />\nand grads alike. \"At Hopkins<br />\nwrestling and other team sports<br />\nare one of the few areas whereone<br />\ncan let his frustrations out and<br />\nalso meet new people,\" he<br />\nremarked.<br />\nThe coach is eagerly waiting<br />\nfor the advent of some football<br />\nplayers. Included in this group is<br />\nsophomore Wayne Panullo who<br />\nstarted at 177 lbs. last year.<br />\nAlso freshman Brian Coulter,<br />\nSam Matz and Jim Udell will<br />\nmove indoors. Coulter is a tough<br />\ngrappler from Wilmington<br />\nDelaware. Matz placed fourth in<br />\nBaltimore County and is<br /><br />\nundefeated in dual meets. Udell<br />\nplaced 7th in the New Mexico<br />\nAAAA State Tournament.<br />\nOther freshman vying for<br />\nstarting berths are Peter Bascom,<br />\nSteve Lazzaro, Robert Nadeau,<br />\nRobert Rosenwasser and Craig<br />\nSnyder. Bascom, at 150, placed<br />\n3rd in the Maryland tournament<br />\nwhile Lazzaro took 1st place in<br />\nthe 105 bracket. Up north<br />\nRosenwasser took 3rd in Orange<br />\nCounty, NY tournament. While<br />\nthose three were doing well at<br />\nhome, Nadeau and Snyder were<br />\nmopping up outside the U.S.<br />\nNadeau took 1st in the Europe<br />\ntourney for U.S. Dependent<br />\nSchools and Snyder placed 2nd<br />\nin the Far East tournament.<br />\nMeanwhile upperclassmen Mel<br />\nMorse, who sat our last year, Bill<br />\nBirmingham and Greg Goldman<br />\nare looking to break into the<br />\nline-up.<br />\nReturning senior co-captains<br /><br />\nCHARLIE<br />\nCHAPLIN<br />\nin<br /><br />\nNeil Hazard and Craig Stevens<br />\nwill be joined by junior Clark<br />\nKingery as team leaders this<br />\nseason. Hazard, a persistent<br />\ngrappler wracked up 10 wins<br />\nagainst 2 losses last year at 190. In<br />\ntwo years Hazard has gained 98<br />\nteam points for the Blue Jays.<br />\nStevens had a 9-3 record last year<br />\nat 167 and has collected 10 pins<br />\nin 24 matches during his career<br />\nhere. Unfortunately he is still<br />\nrecovering from knee surgery but<br />\nexpects to be wrestling by<br />\nJanuary. Kingery, also 9-3 last<br />\nyear, wrestled at 134. In the<br />\nMAC Tournament the junior<br />\ntook 4th place and he holds two<br />\nJHU records for reversals, 15 for<br />\none season and 29 for a career.<br />\nTwo other 4th place finishers<br />\nare Ron Pucillo at 118 and Rob<br />\nFink at 142. Pucillo had a 7-4-1<br />\nrecord last year and currently<br />\nholds the JHU records for most<br />\nnear falls (13) and escapes (18).<br /><br />\nFink, inventor of the now<br />\nfamous Inky Dink move, had an<br />\n8-3 record and tied Pucillo with<br />\n13 near falls.<br />\nGary Murza, a freshman<br />\nstandout, with an 11-1<br />\nheavyweight record last year, is<br />\nhoping to drop down to 190.<br />\nThis should prove to be<br />\ninteresting as he and Hazard<br />\nbattle it out for the spot. Murza<br />\ngarnered 56 team points last<br />\nyear, a new record. Other<br />\nfreshmen starters returning from<br />\nlast year are Dave Mulock at 158<br />\nand Mike Privitera at 126.<br />\nMulock with a 7-5 record and<br />\nPrivitera at 5-6-1 are both tough<br />\ncompetitors and should do much<br />\nbetter this year.<br />\nWith the help of the Hopkins<br />\ntrainer, Leroy \"Brandy\"<br />\nBrandimore, in keeping his<br />\ngrapplers healthy, Coach Gotwals<br />\nshould have a very good season<br />\nand finish better than last year<br /><br />\nTake The Money And Run'<br />\nIs nuttiness triumphant.\"<br />\n\u2014LOOK MAGAZINE<br /><br />\nSUNDAY,<br /><br />\n\"rib<br />\ncracking<br />\ncomedy\"<br /><br />\n\"Insanely<br />\nfunny\"<br />\n\u2014TIME MAGAZINE<br /><br />\n\u2014JUDITH CRIST<br /><br />\nNOVEMBER 11<br />\nPALOMAR PICTURES INTERNATIONAL PRESENTS<br /><br />\n7:30 &amp; 9:30 P.M.<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\nwith<br />\nackie Coogan<br /><br />\nADMISSION:<br />\n$1.00 with ID;<br />\n$1.25 without<br /><br />\nand<br />\nA Rare Chaplin Short<br /><br />\nTHE IDLE CLASS<br />\nwith Edna Purviance<br /><br />\nan rbc films presentation<br /><br />\nWOODY ALLEN'S<br /><br />\nstar:TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN\" .<br />\nWOODY ALLEN and JANET MARGOLIN<br />\nFROM THE AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANY,INC.<br />\nDISTRIBUTED BY CINERAMA RELEASING CORPORATION<br /><br />\nCOLOR<br /><br />\n1:21:03\u20ac0:<br /><br />\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 9 ONLY<br />\n7:30 &amp; 9:30P.M.<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\n(NOT SHAFFER 3,<br />\nCONTRARY TO<br />\nPOPULAR BELIEF)<br />\nADMISSION $1.00<br /><br />\npage 12/news-letter/november 9, 1973<br /><br />\nNew community newspaper off to favorable start<br />\nBy MICHAEL MANES<br />\ncommunity projects and begun<br />\nTwo months ago the to raise some issues.<br />\nWaverly-Charles Village area<br />\nAmong the many local-related<br />\nwitnessed the birth of a new issues which the paper is working<br />\ncommunity newspaper, the on are opposition to the request<br />\n\"Plain Talker,\" a non-profit, by Baltimore Gas and Electric to<br />\nnon -bureaucratic medium raise the cost of steam and<br />\nconsisting of people who simply electricity by ten percent, and<br />\nwant to make the area a better opposition to any further<br />\ndevelopment of the Wyman Park<br />\nplace in which to live.<br />\n\"There are no editors, area.<br />\n\"In the Wyman Park<br />\neveryone is a contributor and has<br />\na voice to structure the paper. controversy the Hopkins Office<br />\nand we consist of more or less of Community Affairs has been<br />\ntwenty people,\" noted staff very cooperative.\" noted Nancy<br />\nwriter Chris Cummins. \"The Moore, another contributor to<br />\nimmediate aim of the paper is to the paper.<br />\nThe journal is also<br />\nreport news of the people who<br />\nare exploited,\" he added. \"Those investigating the pros and cons of<br />\nwho are exploited are the the proposed hotel on Barclay<br />\nworking class, the ones Street, one block west of<br />\ncontrolled by Big Business,\" Greenmount Avenue, which has<br />\nbecome a somewhat controversial<br />\nasserted members of the staff.<br />\n\"Most major newspapers like issue.<br />\n\"The hotel is going to change<br />\n'The Baltimore Sun' present the<br />\nviews of Big Business, although the nature of the area from<br />\nthe 'Sun' is the more liberal residential to commercial,<br />\npaper of Baltimore,\" said Bob although no definite stand has<br />\nbeen taken yet by the group,\"<br />\nSpellman another writer.<br />\nAlthough the immediate aims noted both Moore and Spellman.<br />\nSurprisingly enough, the young<br />\nof the \"Plain Talker\" appear to<br />\nbe experimental and somewhat paper does not have financial<br />\nambiguous at this time, the paper difficulties.<br />\n\u2014Although we are going to<br />\nhas started some definite<br /><br />\nThe<br />\nWaverly.<br />\nCharles<br />\nVillage<br /><br />\nOUR COMMUNITY AT THE FAIR<br />\nBaltimore in Mit:attire hr a phrase used by many<br />\nto describe the recent Baltimore City Fair, The<br />\nanimal celebrAtion took place on a tract ofland<br />\n0113 511r founding tit,\" Inner Harbor. later<br />\n.<br />\nis(' the iota) attericiance start al I Million people.<br />\nThe fair, which is the only one ofits kind itt ;he<br />\ncount ty, began with is speech by the mayor !bar<br />\nwas televised by a national network.
