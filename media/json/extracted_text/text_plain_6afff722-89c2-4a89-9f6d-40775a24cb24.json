He kept to<br />\nhimself a lot and he was pictured<br />\nby his neighbors, all Freshmen, as<br />\nbeing quiet, well-behaved, orderly, and<br />\nangelic to a point of idiocy. At least<br />\nthat is what the freshmen living in the<br />\nadjoining rooms thought. Well, one<br />\nevening, freshies decided to try to get<br />\na use out of the fellow. He seemed to<br />\nbe a nice sort of companion, and the<br />\nboys felt that they ought to do something calculated to rouse him up a<br />\nbit. Then, they figured, after the apologies were made and the blood cleared<br />\naway, all the men on the floor could<br />\nlive in comparative harmony for the<br />\nduration of the term. In a word, the<br />\nboys were a little irked, and a bit<br />\nself - conscious at their neighbors'<br />\nseeming unwillingness to let loose.<br />\nThey wanted to see, first of all,<br />\nwhether he could \"take it,\" and second<br />\nwhether he was a \"regular fellow\" or<br />\nnot all that the word implies Besides, in their opinion, things in their<br />\nentry had been quiet for several days,<br />\nand it was high time that normalcy be<br />\nrestored.<br />\nSecret Entrance<br />\nTo begin, they managed to secure<br />\nentry to the man's room (by a method<br />\nwhich will not be divulged here, since<br />\nthe author of this article is an \"inhabitant\" of the dorm.)

The expectation<br />\nhere was, of course, that when the unsuspecting victim opened the door,<br />\neverything would be dragged off the<br />\ndesks and bookcase to crash to the<br />\nfloor.<br />\nAccording to his usual custom, they<br />\ncould expect him to come in about<br />\nten-thirty.

He kept to<br />\nhimself a lot and he was pictured<br />\nby his neighbors, all Freshmen, as<br />\nbeing quiet, well-behaved, orderly, and<br />\nangelic to a point of idiocy. At least<br />\nthat is what the freshmen living in the<br />\nadjoining rooms thought. Well, one<br />\nevening, freshies decided to try to get<br />\na use out of the fellow. He seemed to<br />\nbe a nice sort of companion, and the<br />\nboys felt that they ought to do something calculated to rouse him up a<br />\nbit. Then, they figured, after the apologies were made and the blood cleared<br />\naway, all the men on the floor could<br />\nlive in comparative harmony for the<br />\nduration of the term. In a word, the<br />\nboys were a little irked, and a bit<br />\nself - conscious at their neighbors'<br />\nseeming unwillingness to let loose.<br />\nThey wanted to see, first of all,<br />\nwhether he could \"take it,\" and second<br />\nwhether he was a \"regular fellow\" or<br />\nnot all that the word implies Besides, in their opinion, things in their<br />\nentry had been quiet for several days,<br />\nand it was high time that normalcy be<br />\nrestored.<br />\nSecret Entrance<br />\nTo begin, they managed to secure<br />\nentry to the man's room (by a method<br />\nwhich will not be divulged here, since<br />\nthe author of this article is an \"inhabitant\" of the dorm.)

The expectation<br />\nhere was, of course, that when the unsuspecting victim opened the door,<br />\neverything would be dragged off the<br />\ndesks and bookcase to crash to the<br />\nfloor.<br />\nAccording to his usual custom, they<br />\ncould expect him to come in about<br />\nten-thirty.
