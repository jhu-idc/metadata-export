This route<br />\nacross Maryland is an important part of a continuous route through<br />\nten States\u2014Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New<br />\nYork, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire<br />\nand Maine\u2014by which an automobile may travel from Augusta, Me.,<br />\nto the National Capital over an unbroken succession of State high-<br />\nways, passing through the principal cities of the Eastern Seaboard,<br />\na distance of about 679.5 miles.<br />\n<br />\nThe roads of Maryland are naturally divided into four main<br />\narterial systems, with the city of Baltimore as the centre.<br />\n<br />\nWith Baltimore as a base, these four unique tours can be made by<br />\nautomobile with ease and comfort in about a week\u2019s time.<br />\n<br />\nThese tours naturally begin with that of the Eastern Shore, the<br />\nmain artery of which begins at Elkton and passes south through<br />\nthis fertile and thriving section of the State, where many houses<br />\ndating from the Colonial period still remain. The route divides at<br />\nChurch Hill, and affords the choice of two roads, by one of which,<br />\npassing through Centreville and Easton, the beauty of the shores of<br />\nthe Chesapeake Bay may be enjoyed, and by the other passing inland<br />\nthrough the highly cultivated farming section through Denton and<br />\nFederalsburg to Hurlock, where the roads unite and pass to<br />\nSalisbury.<br />\n<br />\nFrom Salisbury a concrete boulevard 35 miles in length runs to<br />\nOcean City. On this boulevard at Berlin a spur will connect with<br />\nthe Du Pont Boulevard in Delaware, by which travel from the East<br />\nmay reach the Maryland highways, journeying up over these roads<br />\nto Baltimore via Elkton. This system beyond Salisbury terminates<br />\nat Crisfield, the southern extremity of this section of the State.<br />\n<br />\nThis trip from Baltimore represents a running distance to Salis-<br />\nbury of about 176.3 miles, and going and returning requires about<br />\ntwo days, the many large towns affording excellent hotel accommo-<br />\ndations for tourists.<br />\n<br />\nThe second tour from Baltimore is through Belair in Harford<br />\ncounty, and thence via Aberdeen across the Susquehanna river at<br />\nHavre de Grace to Elkton ; returning through the rolling country of<br />\nthe northern part of Cecil county through Fair Hill and Rising Sun,<br />\ncrossing the Susquehanna river at Conowingo and reaching Balti-<br />\nmore via Belair. This route, with its two crossings of the Susque-<br />\nhanna river and running through the hilly country of the north-<br />\neastern part of the State, is one of great variety and interest.<br />\n<br />\nFrom Baltimore a fine boulevard runs to Annapolis, the capital<br />\nof the State, with its interesting Colonial houses and the beautiful<br />\nNaval Academy. As a continuation of this route, the State highway<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\npasses from Annapolis south through Prince Frederick in Calvert<br />\ncounty to Solomon\u2019s Island, a distance from Baltimore of about<br />\n84.4 miles\u2014the round trip easily accomplished in a day.<br />\n<br />\nWashington is reached from Baltimore by the fine Washington<br />\nBoulevard, a distance of about 40 miles, and the tour of another<br />\nsection of the Western Shore of Maryland begins at the District of<br />\nColumbia line and runs through Prince George\u2019s county to Waldorf<br />\nin Charles county, where the route divides, in one case passing<br />\nthrough La Plata to Rock Point on the Potomac river, the second<br />\nroute from Waldorf passing through Charlotte Hall and Leonard-<br />\ntown\u2014both places historically interesting of the Lords of Calvert<br />\nand Colonial days\u2014te Point Lookout, the southern extremity of<br />\nSt. Mary\u2019s county and of this section of the State.<br />\n<br />\nThe fourth tour from Baltimore is by the main western artery to<br />\nOakland in Garrett county, at the extreme western part of the State,<br />\nthrough the beautiful rolling country of Howard and Frederick<br />\ncounties, into the lower ranges of the Blue Ridge Mountains in<br />\nWashington county, and beyond in Allegany and Garrett counties<br />\nfor 83.5 miles into the Allegheny Mountains, through Cumberland<br />\nand the rich mineral district of the State to Oakland, a distance of<br />\n192.3 miles. From Frederick one spur runs to the Virginia line and<br />\n<br />\nHarpers Ferry, and by another through Thurmont and Emmitsburg<br />\n<br />\nthe Pennsylvania line is crossed to reach Gettysburg. The latter<br />\npoint may also be reached by leaving this main artery at West<br />\nFriendship, and going via Westminster and Taneytown, or by the<br />\nmore direct route through Reisterstown. From a point near Mount<br />\nAiry on this main route a State road runs through Montgomery<br />\ncounty to Washington, by which this western tour may be varied,<br />\nreaching Baltimore again over the Washington Boulevard.<br />\n<br />\nThe scenery of Maryland is very varied and of rare beauty. The<br />\ncontinuous route over the western extremity of the State in the<br />\nheart of the Allegheny Mountains over the main western artery to<br />\nBaltimore, and from thence crossing the Susquehanna river at<br />\nHavre de Grace to Elkton and down over the State roads of the<br />\nEastern Shore to Ocean City, Md., is unsurpassed in the variety<br />\nand beauty of the scenery, and is a distance of about 403.4 miles<br />\nfrom the mountains to the sea, all within the State.<br />\n<br />\nIn the new State highways of Maryland a greater degree of con-<br />\ncentrated interest and variety is afforded the tourist by automobile<br />\nthan in any other State. There is not a mile of monotony; the<br />\nbeauty, great historic interest and advantages of the State have been<br />\nmade open and of free access to all, and a week spent on the Mary-<br />\nland roads will abundantly repay those who come within our bor-<br />\nders, and it will be found that the State has prepared a warm<br />\nwelcome in the roads that have been built and which have so fully<br />\nopened all for which the State is justly celebrated.<br />\n<br />\nThe distance of every town and point of interest from Baltimore<br />\nas they lie on the State highways is plainly marked on this map,<br />\nand the map should go far to awaken general interest in this new<br />\nfield that has been opened to tourists by automobile, for the free<br />\ndistribution among whom it has been prepared.<br />\n<br />\n     <br />\n   <br />\n     <br />\n    <br />\n<br />\n  <br />\n<br />\nPrince<br />\n3 Frederick<br />\n66.4<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\npSracgi<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nX Dclmar 1833<br />\n<br />\nPowvallville<br />\n198.3<br />\n<br />\n202.1<br />\n<br />\n4/ 0caan City<br />\n2l<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "S=__ @PHILADELPHIA<br /><br />\ne 1031l<br />\nCAMDEN<br />\n104.4 i<br /><br />\nSt<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n\u2019 RENTON .<br />\neRE 1427 @<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nBurthTgn o / _ / , v 9<br />\n. own O<br />\n501\"324 i lgg.\u00e9nsww Elizabefh OWeehawken 2055<br />\n- 1879 _\u2014~\u2014H | o \u00a9608.6, Winth<br />\nS =\u2014\u2014T(ONEW YORK \\\\ \\ , | Pl Springs o ASSRS e<br />\n. i OWATERVILLE<br />\n- welle.

From a point near Mount<br />\nAiry on this main route a State road runs through Montgomery<br />\ncounty to Washington, by which this western tour may be varied,<br />\nreaching Baltimore again over the Washington Boulevard.<br /><br />\nThe scenery of Maryland is very varied and of rare beauty. The<br />\ncontinuous route over the western extremity of the State in the<br />\nheart of the Allegheny Mountains over the main western artery to<br />\nBaltimore, and from thence crossing the Susquehanna river at<br />\nHavre de Grace to Elkton and down over the State roads of the<br />\nEastern Shore to Ocean City, Md., is unsurpassed in the variety<br />\nand beauty of the scenery, and is a distance of about 403.4 miles<br />\nfrom the mountains to the sea, all within the State.<br /><br />\nIn the new State highways of Maryland a greater degree of con-<br />\ncentrated interest and variety is afforded the tourist by automobile<br />\nthan in any other State. There is not a mile of monotony; the<br />\nbeauty, great historic interest and advantages of the State have been<br />\nmade open and of free access to all, and a week spent on the Mary-<br />\nland roads will abundantly repay those who come within our bor-<br />\nders, and it will be found that the State has prepared a warm<br />\nwelcome in the roads that have been built and which have so fully<br />\nopened all for which the State is justly celebrated.<br /><br />\nThe distance of every town and point of interest from Baltimore<br />\nas they lie on the State highways is plainly marked on this map,<br />\nand the map should go far to awaken general interest in this new<br />\nfield that has been opened to tourists by automobile, for the free<br />\ndistribution among whom it has been prepared.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\nPrince<br />\n3 Frederick<br />\n66.4<br /><br /><br /><br />\npSracgi<br /><br /><br /><br />\nX Dclmar 1833<br /><br />\nPowvallville<br />\n198.3<br /><br />\n202.1<br /><br />\n4/ 0caan City<br />\n2l<br /><br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 52635, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "4471b33d-5286-44cd-9554-53de34e16e33", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/16801-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 16801, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "37e56ba9-0d8d-42e3-a707-87f88f0cbd5a", "url": "/node/16801"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "5c028f09-3442-4a50-a590-d5915e6e91a1"}]}
