Funk Night<br />\nhad been gaining popularity since winter<br />\nbreak and had been filling the Grad Club to<br />\ncapacity. The success of Funk Night proved<br />\na problem. Last week it was cancelled because<br />\nof noise complaints and problems with alcohol<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nWhile the problems these two events encountered are real and legitimate, students,<br />\nespecially those involved in the planning and<br />\nrunning of these events, can only watch as<br />\nthey are curtailed or cancelled. The recent<br />\nproblems raise the question: What is the status<br />\nof programming right now, and where is programming headed.?<br />\nThe Hopkins Organization for Programming is clearly an important element, since its<br />\nsole purpose is to provide programming for<br />\nthe campus. The current assistant director of<br />\n<br />\nSusan Hoffman<br />\n<br />\nHowie Fried, next year's director of the Hopkins<br />\nOrganization for Programming<br />\n<br />\nthe HOP, Howie Fried, who will serve next<br />\nyear as director, has been addressing the problems encountered by these events, particularly Hoppy Hour. Ten Hoppy Hours have been<br />\nscheduled already for next fall, effectively<br />\ndoubling the number held this semester.<br />\nFried said, \"Hoppy Hour was a big thing,<br />\nan important issue to address for next year.\"<br />\nFried also said the HOP will do everything<br />\npossible to continue Funk Night in some form<br />\nnext year, stressing that the continuation of<br />\nsuccessful events is one of the HOP's<br />\npriorities.<br />\nComedy Clubs are another event the HOP<br />\nsponsored this year and will continue to sponsor next year. \"They've not been as successful as we had hoped,\" said Fried, \"but<br />\nthat should change next year through better<br />\nplanning and better programming.\"<br />\nFried stresed a new concept he hoped to sell<br />\nto Homewood. This concept, proposed at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting Wednesday, is to institute a student activities fee.<br />\nFried explained,\"Money is the key to good<br />\nprogramming. With more money we can offer better events, which in turn will attract<br />\nmore students and eventually bring in more<br />\nmoney. This is a way the students can contribute to the social programming. Social life<br />\nhere will never be better without more<br />\nmoney.\"<br />\nFried said that an activities fee would not<br />\nrelieve the University of its responsibility to<br />\nthe students to adequately fund programming,<br />\nbut instead would augment the current HOP<br />\nbudget. Under his plan, \"the money would<br />\nbe used directly and solely for the students.\"<br />\nKaren Rappaport, co-chair of the HOP<br />\nSocial Committee, said of programming at<br />\nHopkins, \"We've come a long way. There<br />\nare a lot more people involved.\" She said the<br />\nFine Arts committee has \"really taken off.<br />\nThe biggest accomplishment of the social<br />\ncommittee this year is that we've made Hoppy Hour stick. But other areas are lacking:<br />\na lot needs to be done.\"<br />\nJane Gentil, assistant director for student<br />\nactivities, addresses programming issues<br />\nthrough her role in advising the HOP, the<br />\nInter-Campus Programming Board (ICPB),<br />\nand the Union Board. The ICPB conducts pro'<br />\n,ramming between schools and includes<br />\n<br />\nJim Crawford<br />\n<br />\nThe interior of the Grad Club, former home to Funk Night<br />\nrepresentatives from Goucher, Loyola, Notre<br />\nDame, and Towson State. Their events are<br />\nnon-alcoholic and have been successful in the<br />\npast. The Union Board is a small programming board out of the SAC that does novelty<br />\nand theme programming where, again,<br />\nalcohol is not a focus.<br />\nOne obstacle hindering programming is the<br />\nimage of the HOP on campus. Gentil said, \"If<br />\nmore people would take the HOP seriously,<br />\nprogramming would be easier. The HOP is<br />\nthe programming board with representation<br />\nfrom all over the university.\" She said that<br />\nthe HOP could be an effective, successful programming board with more participation and<br />\nsupport from students.<br />\nAnother problem Gentil saw is a lack of<br />\nusable space. \"We use the space to the best<br />\nof our ability,\" said Gentil. Another big problem for programming is publicity. According to Gentil, \"publicity is a problem aggravated by students living off campus. It is<br />\nhard to get students. We are always thinking<br />\nof new ideas for publicizing events.\"<br />\nAlcohol policy is an issue that can strongly<br />\ninfluence programming events, and since the<br />\ncurrent policy has raised questions and caused some controversy, a University-wide<br />\nSocial Alcohol Policy Committee has been<br />\nestablished to address the issue.<br />\nGentil, who is chairing the committee, said<br />\nits goal is to establish a consistent policy on<br />\nthe basis of input from all facets of the campus. \"A consistent policy will help groups<br />\nwork together more effectively,\" she said.<br />\n<br />\nDespite success, Funk Night shuts down<br />\nFUNK, from 1<br />\nand at the bar.<br />\nOn the night in question, Reggae Night, over 150 persons were<br />\nin attendance. \"It was impossible, under the circumstances,<br />\ngiven the number of people there<br />\nand the number of people I had<br />\nworking with me, to go around<br />\nthe Grad Club to check the people who were drinking and see if<br />\nthey had a stamp, and if they<br />\ndidn't have a stamp to ask them<br />\nfor their ID,\" said Engler. \"It<br />\nwas like a leaky sieve: there were<br />\ntoo many people.\"<br />\nEngler attributed complaints<br />\nabout the noise not to the music<br />\nlevel but to the size of the crowds.<br />\n\"The problem was too many people going to Funk Night,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"People would congregate<br />\noutside the Grad Club, they'd<br />\ntalk, and they'd be loud when<br />\nthey walked out.\"<br />\nPaul Thesiger, president of the<br />\nCaribbean Interest Group, was<br />\nthe disc jockey for last week's<br />\nReggae Night. \"It's ironic that<br />\nthe Grad Club was in danger of<br />\nclosing last year,\" he said.<br />\nThesiger expressed disappointment about the decision to cancel<br />\nFunk Night, especially since the<br />\nthree Reggae nights since the fall<br />\n<br />\nhad proven to be popular.<br />\nblow is just not going to work,\" ment and cooperaton in running<br />\nEngler would like to revive he said, calling the Rat a \"nasty Funk Night. \"We really could<br />\nFunk Night in its original form place\" with a \"bad reputation.\" not have asked for a better<br />\nnext semester, with increased en\"The Grad Club is great,\" he chance,\" he said. \"I don't think<br />\nforcement of the alcohol policy. continued. \"It's the ideal size, it's anybody anticipated it working<br />\nWhile the News-Letter has been cool and laid back.

The SAC, in<br />\nEngler's view, could also absorb<br />\nthe costs of the sound equipment<br />\nand the Grad Club room.<br />\nAnother option, which Engler<br />\nconsiders more likely, is a \"dry\"<br />\nFunk Night. \"It would be the<br />\nsame thing: a drink and a slice of<br />\npizza for sixty-five cents, but<br />\nthere'd be no beer,\" he said. A<br />\nno-alcohol policy, while it may<br />\nreduce crowds, would reduce the<br />\nnoise level.

He proposed that students pay, in addition to tuition, a Student Activities fee. This<br />\nfee, devised to increase the Student Activities<br />\nfund, would benefit the HOP and the various<br />\nclubs and organizations that fall under the<br />\njurisdiction of the Student Activities Office.<br />\nFried argues that the additional funds would increase and enhance both the quality and number<br />\nof social programs on campus.<br />\nWe would be fools not to acknowledge the<br />\nlogic in Fried's proposal. Money is, after all,<br />\na scarce commodity at this university, and is<br />\nconsequently always welcome, particularly at<br />\nthe Student Activities Office. Channeling more<br />\nfunds into its overburdened budget can only<br />\nserve to ameliorate the current situation.<br />\nThe mechanics of this proposal remain, of<br />\ncourse, to be worked out. The deans would<br />\nhave to work together to determine how to<br />\ndirect these funds straight to Student Activities.<br />\nIn addition, it is imperative that the fee be<br />\nused to supplement, not supplant, the existing<br />\nbudget. Call us jaded, but the administration,<br />\nwhich already sees us as revenue raisers, would<br />\nbe only too willing to thrust the financial burden<br />\nof Student Activities back into our laps.<br />\nHowever, there is more to the improvement<br />\nof social programming at Hopkins than simply money. For a tangible difference to be felt<br />\nin this realm, other factors need to be improved. It appears to us initially, at least, that<br />\nan increase in activities funds would ensure that<br />\nthe HOP would have fewer difficulties in securing bigger names and better entertainment<br />\nevents to book on campus. This line of logic,<br />\nhowever, leads us to an obvious stumbling<br />\nblock\u2014the dearth of facilities to house these activities. Both Shriver and Levering Halls are<br />\nrelatively small venues; they are subject to<br />\nscheduling restrictions that boggle the mind,<br />\ndue to their usage by every sector of the University, not just undergraduates. Those who try<br />\nto get around the shortcomings of the facilities<br />\nhere often get shot down by the inevitable administrative reply: \"That won't work here.\"<br />\nAttitude, then, has a lot to do with the success or failure of a program on campus. It is<br />\nhard to tell how the administration stands on<br />\n<br />\nthis issue. On the one hand, they value social<br />\nprogramming as an essential ingredient in that<br />\never-elusive \"good environment\" that they<br />\nseek. Yet, they go about it in a half-hearted<br />\nway. The money they do allocate to the program sinks in a quagmire of rules and restrictions. And innumerable guidelines, designed<br />\nmainly to protect the University from the<br />\nmistakes and mishaps of its students, often kill<br />\nevents before they even get off the ground. Being a HOP director these days requires a user's<br />\nmanual to make sense of the job's seemingly<br />\nendless limitations. As a result, the image of<br />\ncampus events suffers. To quote Jane Gentil,<br />\nthe HOP is not taken seriously. Forced by<br />\nUniversity restrictions to limit severely the<br />\nnumber of alcohol events on campus, the HOP<br />\noften resorts to silly, obscure themes as a drawing point, a practice that often fails miserably.<br />\nWhile we do not advocate alcohol as a form<br />\nof entertainment, one must accept the fact that<br />\nit is a major drawing point for collegiate events.<br />\nOne need only look at the two most successful,<br />\nweekly events of the year to verify this.

Recent research shows that<br />\nwomen earn slightly higher GPAs<br />\nthan men in the same college<br />\nlargely because they tend to take<br />\ncourses that are graded a little<br />\nhigher.<br />\n2. By using separate \"regression\" equations for predicting<br />\nGPAs, one can readily eliminate<br />\nprediction \"bias.\" That is, the<br />\nstatistically best-weighted combination of predictors usually<br />\nwon't be quite the same for<br />\nwomen as for men.<br />\n3. Virtually any quantifiable<br />\npredictors may be entered into the<br />\nprediction equation. The following usually produce moderately<br />\nhigh correlations with GPAs:<br />\n<br />\nlank in high school graduating<br />\nclass, SAT-V score, and SAT-M<br />\nscore, and the averagc of scores<br />\non the College Board achievement test the student took (usually at least three).<br />\n4. The college grades of blacks<br />\ntend to be somewhat overpredicted when in a particular<br />\nsituation one uses the optimallyweighted set of predictors based<br />\non whites; blacks tended to have<br />\nsomewhat lower GPAs than<br />\nthe equation predicts. This can be<br />\navoided by using one prediction<br />\nequation for blacks and another<br />\nfor whites, to \"fit\" each group<br />\nbest.<br />\n5. I have not studied prediction<br />\nfor hispanics, but the same principles would apply to it.<br />\n6. One might, of course, also<br />\ntry other variables experimentally to determine what, if anything,<br />\nthey would contribute to predicting GPAs better, such as the<br />\n<br />\n,re, socio-economic<br />\n5Latus, distance from the college<br />\nthat the student's home is (the farther the better?), father's. and/or<br />\nmother's level of education,<br />\nethnicity, number of graduates in<br />\nthe student's high school class,<br />\nnumber of honors courses taken<br />\nin high school, etc.<br />\n7. Various outcomes might be<br />\npredicted: first semester GPA,<br />\nfreshman year GPA, cumulative<br />\nGPA at graduation, number of<br />\nsemesters needed to graduate,<br />\nreceiving departmental honors vs.<br />\nnot, staying at Hopkins vs. leaving before graduation, etc. It is<br />\neven feasible to predict the major field of study in which the student is likely to graduate. The<br />\npredictors for that might appreciably differ from those that<br />\npredict GPA the best.<br />\n8. Finally, what kind(s) of<br />\n\"bias\" was Ms. Anne Langley<br />\ntrying to discuss? That's an ex-<br />\n<br />\nSpeaking out on the Five-Year Plan<br />\nThe following position paper<br />\nwas written by a subcommittee of<br />\nthe Graduate Record Organization that was delegated the<br />\nresponsibility of drafting the official graduate student response<br />\nto the University's Five-Year<br />\nPlan. It represents the consensus<br />\nopinion of the GRO.<br />\n<br />\nand departmental privileges and<br />\nmore openly concerned with the<br />\nschool's health as a whole. The<br />\nUniversity should be led by its<br />\nfaculty; we can no longer afford<br />\nto have the University run by the<br />\nunaccountable corporate management as if it were a business.<br />\n<br />\nproposed by the Five-Year Plan.<br />\nIf the University wants to balance<br />\nthe budget on our backs (saving<br />\nmoney by using graduate students<br />\nrather than full faculty to teach)<br />\nwe demand just compensation<br />\nand involvement in how the new<br />\nsystem is set up and operated.<br />\n5.

And while there has<br />\nbeen criticism of the administration's Plan from faculty and<br />\nstudents alike, a sense of perspective is needed to place Hopkins<br />\nwhere it belongs in a wide range<br />\nof other top-level universities.<br />\nThese universities, among the<br />\nbest in the nation, have been<br />\nundergoing similar difficulties in<br />\nrecent years, although each has<br />\nadapted its divisional structure to<br />\ntry to accomodate the pressures<br />\nit faces. Hopkins exists on one<br />\nend of the spectrum of universities in its decentralization of<br />\ndivisions. In most universities,<br />\ndivisions are more centrally funded than Hopkins and each has<br />\ndeveloped its own methods for<br />\nallocating funds to where they are<br />\nmost needed,just as Hopkins has<br />\ndeveloped its Five-Year Plan.<br />\nAccording to Provost John<br />\nLombardi, the history of<br />\nHopkins's divisional structure<br />\ntraces back to its inception, when<br />\nthere were two original<br />\n<br />\ndivisions\u2014Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe School of Medicine. Over the<br />\nyears, other divisions were formed, each with its own financial<br />\nresources so that they would not<br />\nbe taking resources away from<br />\nprevious divisions. The addition<br />\nand removal of divisions has been<br />\nan organic, changing process, as<br />\nthe administration has historically collapsed weaker ones and<br />\nlater revived them when they<br />\nwere more financially sound.<br />\nEach division thus becomes a<br />\nself-contained part of the whole,<br />\nand can design the tightest set of<br />\nprograms possible. Everything a<br />\ndivision saves, it can keep and<br />\nspend on its own projects. Thus<br />\nthere is an incentive to be<br />\neconomical in internal budgeting<br />\nand, according to Lombardi,<br />\nthere is no infighting between<br />\ndivisions over university funds.<br />\nFrom a historical perspective,<br />\nwhere most universities have<br />\ngrown<br />\nfrom<br />\ncentral<br />\na<br />\nundergraduate school from<br />\nwhich many graduate programs<br />\nhave developed, Hopkins's<br />\nundergraduate school had<br />\ndeveloped as an overlap of successful graduate schools such as<br />\nEngineering and Medicine. The<br />\nFive-Year Plan was the product<br />\nof the need to raise money to support Arts and Sciences\u2014through<br />\nthe creation of a reserve fund, the<br />\n<br />\ncutting of faculty by ten percent,<br />\na tuition differential system, and<br />\nthe postponing of renovations to<br />\nuniversity facilities. The Medical<br />\nSchool will contribute a substantial portion of the reserve fund,<br />\nfrom its surpluses, and these<br />\nfunds will go toward helping Arts<br />\nand Sciences, by funding Library<br />\nmaintenance and other expenses<br />\nthat it must normally cover.<br />\nOther universities have different structures, although many<br />\nof them face the same problems<br />\nas Hopkins. According to Dr<br />\nMargaret Bates, vice-provost at<br />\nDuke University, for example,<br />\nthe university has a mixed model<br />\nof centralization and decentralization. Some schools within the<br />\nuniversity are allocated money<br />\nbased on a formula agreement,<br />\nwithin which they are free to<br />\nbudget their own departments.<br />\nOther schools within the University are allocated money based on<br />\na formula agreement, within<br />\nwhich they are free to budget<br />\ntheir own departments. Other<br />\nschools in the university are subject to complete centralized control by the administration. Formula agreements are flexible and<br />\nsubject to alterations, some of<br />\nwhich are currently being considered.<br />\nContinued next week<br />\n<br />\nEly Brown<br />\n<br />\nLast Sunday, Brian Goldberg won $100 in the backgammon tournament.<br />\n<br />\nBrian Goldberg takes first place<br />\nin backgammon tournament<br />\nby Deena Dizengoff<br />\nOn Sunday, April 2, at 12:30<br />\np.m., the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMSE Library was filled with the<br />\nsounds of rolling dice and moving checkers.

April 1.<br />\nFollowing the keynote address on<br />\nNew Concepts of Cancer,\u2014 a<br />\ngroup of undergraduate researchers had opportunities to give<br />\npresentations about their research<br />\nprojects.<br />\nThe very distinguished keynote<br />\nspeaker, Dr. Donald S. Coffey,<br />\ndiscussed the history and direction of cancer research. As a Professor of Urology, Professor of<br />\nOncology, and a Professor of<br />\nPharmacology and Molecular<br />\nSciences, he is the first triple professor at Johns Hopkins. His lecture, entitled \"New Concepts of<br />\nCancer,\" described how cancer<br />\nresearch has grown over the past<br />\nfifty years and where it is headed. He began by describing a<br />\nbenign tumor as 'anything that<br />\ngrows in the body as a closed<br />\nfist.\" He continued the idea by<br />\nsaying that \"anything that looks<br />\nlike a crab is invading [other cells<br />\nand organs]; it's malignant.\" Dr.<br />\nCoffey then went on to list many<br />\ncancers that seem to have cures,<br />\nor \"exhibit complete retardation<br />\nupon treatment.\" These include<br />\nHodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor<br />\nand Burkitt's lymphoma. Dr.<br />\nCoffey explains that varieties of<br />\ncancer that don't have cures yet,<br />\n<br />\nlike lung and breast cancer, can<br />\nonly be treated by removal if<br />\nfound early enough.<br />\nAn interesting characteristic of<br />\ncancer cells is that they \"become<br />\nresistant to every treatment<br />\nmade,\" whereas normal ce:ls do<br />\nnot. Furthermore, the resistance<br />\nis apparent both in the \"presence<br />\nand the absence of the chemical.\"<br />\nAnother important characteristic<br />\nassociated with cancer is that, due<br />\nto their genetic instability, each of<br />\nthe cancer cells develop<br />\n\"heterogeneity.\" This means that<br />\neach cell in a cancerous growth<br />\nhas different genetic characteristics than other cells in.<br />\nthat growth., although they all<br />\ncame from the same original<br />\ncells. Dr. Coffey used an analogy<br />\nto explain this. Imagine, he said,<br />\nan apple seed taken from a crab<br />\napple. When it's planted and the<br />\ntree comes up, you'll see red<br />\ndelicious apples on one branch,<br />\ngolden delicious apples on<br />\nanother, '`crab apples over here,<br />\nand Washington State apples over<br />\nthere!\"<br />\nAfter conveying the importance<br />\nof genetic instability of cancer<br />\ncells. Dr. Coffey described how<br />\nnormal cells die regularly,<br />\nwhereas cancer cells do not self<br />\ndestruct. This is once again<br />\nrelated to the genetic instability of<br />\nthe cancer cells. In normal cells,<br />\n\"there is a code somewhere that<br />\ntells it to die.\" This apparently is<br />\nnot the case in cancerous cells.<br />\nDr. Coffey explains further that<br />\n<br />\nthis research led to the idea of<br />\nmorphological instability in<br />\ncancerous cells. In every \"normal cell [nucleus], there exists a<br />\nstructural backbone. . . called the<br />\nnuclear matrix.\" This matrix is<br />\nvery important in handling all the<br />\nDNA that exists in the nucleus.<br />\n'The DNA uses this backbone to<br />\ncode for proteins,''and this very<br />\nbackbone is \"out of whack\" in<br />\ncancerous cells.<br />\nAnother concept that is recently being studied \"quite a lot deals<br />\nwith the mobility\" of cancerous<br />\ncells. The fact that cancer cells<br />\ncan move distinguishes them<br />\nfrom most other cells. Dr. Coffey explained how scientists in the<br />\nOncology Lab at the Medical<br />\nSchool, using Fourier analysis,<br />\nhave described the motion of a<br />\ncell in a mathematical equation.<br />\nThis is important progress since<br />\nmany more studies can now be<br />\ndone with computer simulation of<br />\ncancer cell mobility.<br />\nAnother subject addressed in<br />\nDr. Coffey's speech was the importance of thinking in research.<br />\nDr. Coffey said that although he's<br />\nnot the brightest of people, naying \"failed the fifth gradc . and<br />\ngraduated from a teachers' college in Tennessee\" with<br />\nmediocre grades, he can \"think<br />\nand work with people.\u2014 He explains that when going through<br />\nschool, all the \"good engineers<br />\nand scientists can answer the<br />\nquestions and solve the problems<br />\nat the back of the chapters,\" but<br />\n<br />\nwhen they do research \"they<br />\ndon't know which chapters to<br />\napply to their problems.\u2014 He emphasized the ability to think as a<br />\n\"major research tool\" that we all<br />\nhave. Dr. Coffey continued, \"in<br />\ndoing research,[you must answer<br />\nonly two questions:] first, when<br />\nyou see something,[ask] what its<br />\nimplication is; and second, what's<br />\nthe reason behind the event.\"<br />\nWith these messages, and an<br />\noverview of cancer research, Dr.<br />\nCoffey left for another meeting<br />\nwhere he had to give another<br />\nspeech.<br />\nFollowing this lecture, several<br />\nHopkins undergraduates gave<br />\npresentations on research that<br />\nthey themselves were conducting.<br />\nStephen Tsang, president of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Chapter of the<br />\nAmerican Chemical Society. says<br />\nthat this \"is an excellent opportunity for students to practice giving speeches.\" He explained that<br />\nas \"students go higher in [their]<br />\nschooling, they have to give more<br />\nand more seminar:, and this informal practice helps them quite<br />\na tot.\" Stephen then offered<br />\nthanks to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nChemistry Department for funding the symposium and giving<br />\nthese researchers such an<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nThe first speaker was senior<br />\nKen Grimm, who discussed his<br />\nresearch on \"Photodynamic<br />\nTherapy.\u2022\u2022 George Kao followed<br />\nby talking about the \"SelfDiffusion of Intracellular Water\"<br />\n<br />\nin special fetal fibroblasts. Next,<br />\nJohn Higgins described his<br />\nresearch on the \"Ligand Binding<br />\nof Antigen-Receptor Associations.\" Miki hoh than talked<br />\nabout the \"Sulfur Metabolism\"<br />\nin special bacteria, and Chang<br />\nLee related the importance of<br />\nNMR Studies in the determination of \"Thymidine<br />\nGlycol.\" Other students and their<br />\ntopics of research included Ani<br />\nKetabigian and \"The MacroOrganization\"<br />\nmolecular<br />\nof repetitive DNA sequences,<br />\nMichael L.

He specializes in<br />\ndevelopmental neurobiology\u2014the<br />\nstudy of how a single cell grows<br />\ninto an organism with a complex<br />\nnervous system.<br />\nWhen an organism is developing, the neurons\u2014nerve cells\u2014<br />\nmust extend up to a thousand processes, or arms, in specific directions along specific paths. Each<br />\narm must meet arms from other<br />\nneurons at specific locations at<br />\nIf<br />\norientations.<br />\nspecific<br />\neverything does not happen in ex-<br />\n<br />\nike<br />\n<br />\nDr. Edward Hedgecock<br />\n<br />\nactly the right way, the neural<br />\nfunction of the organism will be<br />\nimpaired. Hedgecock is building<br />\nthe foundations for research into<br />\nwhy nervous systems are successfully built so frequently. With<br />\nfunding from the National Institutes of Health, he is cataloguing neurological mutations of<br />\nCaenorhabditis elegans, a worm.<br />\nSays Hedgecock, \"Until you<br />\nget a mutant, you don't know the<br />\ngene exists.\" A mutant worm indicates that some gene is critical<br />\nto a particular developmental<br />\noperation. Once Hedgecock<br />\nknows a gene exists, he can<br />\nchoose among several methods to<br />\nfind it within the worm's<br />\nchromosomes. Occasionally,<br />\nHedgecock will clone the genes<br />\nof the mutant and of a normal<br />\nworm, and compare the proteins<br />\nthey produce. From there he can<br />\ntry to discover what the protein<br />\ndoes to help the nervous system<br />\ndevelop normally.<br />\nBiologists often study simple<br />\norganisms to gain a basic<br />\nunderstanding of a complex process. The simpler the animal<br />\nstudied, the easier the execution<br />\nof experiments. Worms can be<br />\nhandled in large numbers, since<br />\nthey are small and have simple<br />\nnutritional requirements.

But for his trademark<br />\nwordplay and piercing sarcasm,<br />\nCostello's LP might be the work<br />\nof a brash, precocious new talent.<br />\nMore to the point, however,<br />\nSpike is a clear success. The arrangements on the album are<br />\nCostello's best to date; whether<br />\nin the letter-perfect pop of<br />\n\"Veronica\" or the neo-Motown<br />\nsound of \"Coal-Train Robberies,\" the words and music<br />\nlock together neatly. Session<br />\nmusicians ranging from Paul<br />\nMcCartney to wild guitarist Marc<br />\nRibot give Costello an enormous<br />\nrange of options; his previous<br />\nalbums are drab by comparison.<br />\nLike co-producers T-Bone<br />\nBurnett and Keven Killen,<br />\nCostello has a deadly ear: he<br />\nknows just when arrangements<br />\nget too heavy, and keeps the<br />\nalbum pleasantly chaotic.<br />\nLyrically, the changes are less<br />\ndrastic. The \"emotional fascism\"<br />\nthat fed Costel;o's lyrics for a<br />\ndecade has been replaced, on<br />\nroughly half of \"Spike,\" by<br />\nissues further from the heart and<br />\nmind. In \"Tramp the Dirt<br />\nDown,\" an open letter of sorts to<br />\nMargaret Thatcher, Costello<br />\nreports his desire to live a long<br />\nlife. Trite? Not exactly, for then,<br />\nover acoustic guitar and fiddle, he<br />\n<br />\noffers Thatcher his reason: \"I'd<br />\nlike to live long enough to<br />\nsavor/. . . when they finally put<br />\nyou in the ground/I'll stand on<br />\nyour grave and tramp the dirt<br />\ndown.\"<br />\nMuch of Spike is equally<br />\ncaustic. \"Let Him Dangle\" reexamines the facts of a British<br />\nmurder trial in which Derek<br />\nBentley was hanged for ordering<br />\na minor, Christopher Craig, to<br />\nkill a man. Costello recounts both<br />\nsides of the case with mounting<br />\nexasperation, punctuating each<br />\nverse with the cry, \"let him<br />\ndangle!\" The song's \"murky and<br />\nperky\" arrangement drips with<br />\nirony, and Marc Ribot's spidery<br />\nguitar acts as an eerie collaborator<br />\nfor the \"bloodthirsty chorus\" the<br />\nsong describes.<br />\n\"Pads, Paws, and Claws\" and<br />\n\"Veronica,\" which Costello<br />\nwrote with Paul McCartney, are<br />\ngenuinely fun\u2014a quality which,<br />\nhowever strange its form, has<br />\nlong been the key to Costello's<br />\nwork. But Spike, somehow, is<br />\nmore austere than any of<br />\nCostello's earlier albums, which<br />\nmay repel longtime fans at first.<br />\nIts more whimsical side\u2014found<br />\nin the astonishing wordplay and<br />\ntongue-in-cheek instrumentation\u2014is there, to be sure,<br />\nbut unveiling it takes some<br />\neffort.<br />\nOf the album's fifteen songs<br />\n(fourteen on LP), at least ten are<br />\noutstanding.

They<br />\ncouldn't possibly have thought<br />\nthey could get away with upsetting Hopkins in the quarterfinals<br />\nof the NCAA Tournament. Surely, the top-ranked Blue Jays<br />\nwould get their revenge.<br />\nYet even the Wahoos couldn't<br />\nhave predicted just how complete<br />\nthat revenge would be. Johns<br />\nHopkins dominated play on both<br />\nends of the field last Saturday,<br />\nscoring five unanswered goals in<br />\nthe first quarter and seven in the<br />\nsecond half to pull away for a<br />\n12-3 victory here at Homewood.<br />\nVirginia got off to a fast start,<br />\nas All-American midfielder Andy Kraus won the opening faceoff and Rob Schmaltz scored the<br />\ngame's first goals just thirty<br />\nseconds into the first quarter.<br />\nKraus's ability to control the<br />\nfaceoffs had worried the Hopkins<br />\ncoaches all week, but when he<br />\nwas forced to leave the game with<br />\nan injury early in the quarter, the<br />\nBlue Jays took control.<br />\n\"I thought we'd have trouble<br />\nagainst Kraus because he does a<br />\ngood job of controlling the<br />\nfaceoffs,\" said Hopkins Coach<br />\nDon Zimmerman. \"But when he<br />\nwent out in the first [quarter], it<br />\nallowed us to control the tempo.\"<br />\nThe Jays' domination began at<br />\nthe 1:40 mark of the first quarter,<br />\nwhen Matt Panetta fed Brendan<br />\nKelly to tie the game. Panetta<br />\nadded a goal of his own two<br />\n<br />\nminutes later, and then Hopkins<br />\nbegan to pull away. Consecutive<br />\ngoals by Joe Rzempoluch, Jeff<br />\nIhm, and John Wilkens gave the<br />\nBlue Jays a commanding 5-1 lead<br />\nbefore the first quarter had<br />\nexpired.<br />\nBut the Hopkins offense fell<br />\nasleep in the second quarter as<br />\nthey strayed from their game<br />\nplan, and failed to score for the<br />\nfinal 19:21 of the half. The<br />\nWahoos failed to capitalize,<br />\nhowever, as Quint Kessenich and<br />\nthe Blue Jays defense completely<br />\nshut down their scoring attack.<br />\nThough the Cavaliers scored with<br />\njust one second remaining in the<br />\nhalf to make the score 5-2,<br />\nHopkins survived their scoring<br />\nlull without any serious damage.<br />\nThe defense continued to<br />\ndominate in the second half,<br />\nrecording their fourth thirdquarter shutout of the season.<br />\nOriginally thought to lack depth<br />\nat the beginning of the season, the<br />\nJays' defensive unit has emerged<br />\nas the finest in the country, led by<br />\nseniors Dave Pietramala, Greg<br />\nLilly, Steve Ciccarone, ail(' Pat<br />\nRussell. On Saturday, they blanked the Wahoos for 29:25 in the<br />\nsecond half, allowing Hopkins to<br />\npull away with seven unanswered<br />\ngoals. When Virginia finally<br />\nmanaged to score with only<br />\nthirty-five seconds remaining in<br />\nthe game, it was too late to keep<br />\nHopkins from winning their fourteenth straight regular season game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays spread the scoring around on Saturday, as nine<br />\n<br />\nplayers scored goals. Brendan<br />\nKelly and Mau Panetta led the<br />\nway for Hopkins with two goals<br />\nand an assist apiece.

Jason Klitenic was<br />\ncredited with the win, Scott<br />\nTarantino with the save.<br />\nJeff Fang, a freshman, was the<br />\nstarting pitcher for game two of<br />\nthe doubleheader.

Ten Hoppy Hours have been<br />\nscheduled already for next fall, effectively<br />\ndoubling the number held this semester.<br />\nFried said, \"Hoppy Hour was a big thing,<br />\nan important issue to address for next year.\"<br />\nFried also said the HOP will do everything<br />\npossible to continue Funk Night in some form<br />\nnext year, stressing that the continuation of<br />\nsuccessful events is one of the HOP's<br />\npriorities.<br />\nComedy Clubs are another event the HOP<br />\nsponsored this year and will continue to sponsor next year. \"They've not been as successful as we had hoped,\" said Fried, \"but<br />\nthat should change next year through better<br />\nplanning and better programming.\"<br />\nFried stresed a new concept he hoped to sell<br />\nto Homewood. This concept, proposed at the<br />\nStudent Council meeting Wednesday, is to institute a student activities fee.<br />\nFried explained,\"Money is the key to good<br />\nprogramming. With more money we can offer better events, which in turn will attract<br />\nmore students and eventually bring in more<br />\nmoney. This is a way the students can contribute to the social programming. Social life<br />\nhere will never be better without more<br />\nmoney.\"<br />\nFried said that an activities fee would not<br />\nrelieve the University of its responsibility to<br />\nthe students to adequately fund programming,<br />\nbut instead would augment the current HOP<br />\nbudget. Under his plan, \"the money would<br />\nbe used directly and solely for the students.\"<br />\nKaren Rappaport, co-chair of the HOP<br />\nSocial Committee, said of programming at<br />\nHopkins, \"We've come a long way. There<br />\nare a lot more people involved.\" She said the<br />\nFine Arts committee has \"really taken off.<br />\nThe biggest accomplishment of the social<br />\ncommittee this year is that we've made Hoppy Hour stick. But other areas are lacking:<br />\na lot needs to be done.\"<br />\nJane Gentil, assistant director for student<br />\nactivities, addresses programming issues<br />\nthrough her role in advising the HOP, the<br />\nInter-Campus Programming Board (ICPB),<br />\nand the Union Board. The ICPB conducts pro'<br />\n,ramming between schools and includes<br /><br />\nJim Crawford<br /><br />\nThe interior of the Grad Club, former home to Funk Night<br />\nrepresentatives from Goucher, Loyola, Notre<br />\nDame, and Towson State. Their events are<br />\nnon-alcoholic and have been successful in the<br />\npast. The Union Board is a small programming board out of the SAC that does novelty<br />\nand theme programming where, again,<br />\nalcohol is not a focus.<br />\nOne obstacle hindering programming is the<br />\nimage of the HOP on campus. Gentil said, \"If<br />\nmore people would take the HOP seriously,<br />\nprogramming would be easier. The HOP is<br />\nthe programming board with representation<br />\nfrom all over the university.\" She said that<br />\nthe HOP could be an effective, successful programming board with more participation and<br />\nsupport from students.<br />\nAnother problem Gentil saw is a lack of<br />\nusable space. \"We use the space to the best<br />\nof our ability,\" said Gentil. Another big problem for programming is publicity. According to Gentil, \"publicity is a problem aggravated by students living off campus. It is<br />\nhard to get students. We are always thinking<br />\nof new ideas for publicizing events.\"<br />\nAlcohol policy is an issue that can strongly<br />\ninfluence programming events, and since the<br />\ncurrent policy has raised questions and caused some controversy, a University-wide<br />\nSocial Alcohol Policy Committee has been<br />\nestablished to address the issue.<br />\nGentil, who is chairing the committee, said<br />\nits goal is to establish a consistent policy on<br />\nthe basis of input from all facets of the campus. \"A consistent policy will help groups<br />\nwork together more effectively,\" she said.<br /><br />\nDespite success, Funk Night shuts down<br />\nFUNK, from 1<br />\nand at the bar.<br />\nOn the night in question, Reggae Night, over 150 persons were<br />\nin attendance. \"It was impossible, under the circumstances,<br />\ngiven the number of people there<br />\nand the number of people I had<br />\nworking with me, to go around<br />\nthe Grad Club to check the people who were drinking and see if<br />\nthey had a stamp, and if they<br />\ndidn't have a stamp to ask them<br />\nfor their ID,\" said Engler. \"It<br />\nwas like a leaky sieve: there were<br />\ntoo many people.\"<br />\nEngler attributed complaints<br />\nabout the noise not to the music<br />\nlevel but to the size of the crowds.<br />\n\"The problem was too many people going to Funk Night,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"People would congregate<br />\noutside the Grad Club, they'd<br />\ntalk, and they'd be loud when<br />\nthey walked out.\"<br />\nPaul Thesiger, president of the<br />\nCaribbean Interest Group, was<br />\nthe disc jockey for last week's<br />\nReggae Night. \"It's ironic that<br />\nthe Grad Club was in danger of<br />\nclosing last year,\" he said.<br />\nThesiger expressed disappointment about the decision to cancel<br />\nFunk Night, especially since the<br />\nthree Reggae nights since the fall<br /><br />\nhad proven to be popular.<br />\nblow is just not going to work,\" ment and cooperaton in running<br />\nEngler would like to revive he said, calling the Rat a \"nasty Funk Night. \"We really could<br />\nFunk Night in its original form place\" with a \"bad reputation.\" not have asked for a better<br />\nnext semester, with increased en\"The Grad Club is great,\" he chance,\" he said. \"I don't think<br />\nforcement of the alcohol policy. continued. \"It's the ideal size, it's anybody anticipated it working<br />\nWhile the News-Letter has been cool and laid back.

The SAC, in<br />\nEngler's view, could also absorb<br />\nthe costs of the sound equipment<br />\nand the Grad Club room.<br />\nAnother option, which Engler<br />\nconsiders more likely, is a \"dry\"<br />\nFunk Night. \"It would be the<br />\nsame thing: a drink and a slice of<br />\npizza for sixty-five cents, but<br />\nthere'd be no beer,\" he said. A<br />\nno-alcohol policy, while it may<br />\nreduce crowds, would reduce the<br />\nnoise level.

He proposed that students pay, in addition to tuition, a Student Activities fee. This<br />\nfee, devised to increase the Student Activities<br />\nfund, would benefit the HOP and the various<br />\nclubs and organizations that fall under the<br />\njurisdiction of the Student Activities Office.<br />\nFried argues that the additional funds would increase and enhance both the quality and number<br />\nof social programs on campus.<br />\nWe would be fools not to acknowledge the<br />\nlogic in Fried's proposal. Money is, after all,<br />\na scarce commodity at this university, and is<br />\nconsequently always welcome, particularly at<br />\nthe Student Activities Office. Channeling more<br />\nfunds into its overburdened budget can only<br />\nserve to ameliorate the current situation.<br />\nThe mechanics of this proposal remain, of<br />\ncourse, to be worked out. The deans would<br />\nhave to work together to determine how to<br />\ndirect these funds straight to Student Activities.<br />\nIn addition, it is imperative that the fee be<br />\nused to supplement, not supplant, the existing<br />\nbudget. Call us jaded, but the administration,<br />\nwhich already sees us as revenue raisers, would<br />\nbe only too willing to thrust the financial burden<br />\nof Student Activities back into our laps.<br />\nHowever, there is more to the improvement<br />\nof social programming at Hopkins than simply money. For a tangible difference to be felt<br />\nin this realm, other factors need to be improved. It appears to us initially, at least, that<br />\nan increase in activities funds would ensure that<br />\nthe HOP would have fewer difficulties in securing bigger names and better entertainment<br />\nevents to book on campus. This line of logic,<br />\nhowever, leads us to an obvious stumbling<br />\nblock\u2014the dearth of facilities to house these activities. Both Shriver and Levering Halls are<br />\nrelatively small venues; they are subject to<br />\nscheduling restrictions that boggle the mind,<br />\ndue to their usage by every sector of the University, not just undergraduates. Those who try<br />\nto get around the shortcomings of the facilities<br />\nhere often get shot down by the inevitable administrative reply: \"That won't work here.\"<br />\nAttitude, then, has a lot to do with the success or failure of a program on campus. It is<br />\nhard to tell how the administration stands on<br /><br />\nthis issue. On the one hand, they value social<br />\nprogramming as an essential ingredient in that<br />\never-elusive \"good environment\" that they<br />\nseek. Yet, they go about it in a half-hearted<br />\nway. The money they do allocate to the program sinks in a quagmire of rules and restrictions. And innumerable guidelines, designed<br />\nmainly to protect the University from the<br />\nmistakes and mishaps of its students, often kill<br />\nevents before they even get off the ground. Being a HOP director these days requires a user's<br />\nmanual to make sense of the job's seemingly<br />\nendless limitations. As a result, the image of<br />\ncampus events suffers. To quote Jane Gentil,<br />\nthe HOP is not taken seriously. Forced by<br />\nUniversity restrictions to limit severely the<br />\nnumber of alcohol events on campus, the HOP<br />\noften resorts to silly, obscure themes as a drawing point, a practice that often fails miserably.<br />\nWhile we do not advocate alcohol as a form<br />\nof entertainment, one must accept the fact that<br />\nit is a major drawing point for collegiate events.<br />\nOne need only look at the two most successful,<br />\nweekly events of the year to verify this. Both<br />\nFunk Night and Hoppy Hour, which serve<br />\nalcohol, have enjoyed strong and loyal followings. Both events are also examples of inexpensive programming, belying the notion that<br />\none needs money and fancy themes to attract<br />\na crowd.<br />\nBut what has hampered these successful attempts at programming has not been money;<br />\nit has been the aforementioned administrative<br />\nattitude and lack of available facilities. Hoppy<br />\nHour has suffered from the overbooking of the<br />\nGlass Pavilion, and Funk Night has suffered<br />\ndue to the paranoia of the administration.<br />\nIf we put our ear to the ground, we hear<br />\nrumblings of campus life at other universities<br />\nof comparable academic ilk\u2014those that are also<br />\nwithin states where the drinking age is 21. Student life can be improved to some extent by<br />\nthrowing money at the problem. We are,<br />\nhowever, dangerously close to reaching a<br />\nsaturation point: all of the money in the world,<br />\nand, for that matter, all of the clever programming ideas that enterprising students come up<br />\nwith can make no difference unless structural<br />\nchanges are made.<br /><br />\nThe following is a reprint from the March 4, 1988 issue of The News-Letter.<br /><br />\nPoN'r KNow Now _r EVER<br />\nGOT roacED.INro c4a/N6<br />\nALUMNI<br />\nFoR PoNATio4I511 I MUST g4kE<br /><br />\nREa/vED EVERY cavam,464E<br />\ntiNE AS TO PRY MEY CAN'r<br /><br />\nAk 11E114, /S THIS AP<br /><br />\nAitt. mukty1r7 ,a,<br /><br />\nC4WN6 ON BEAF or 71/E<br />\n(VW Rona AtumAz ruND,<br />\nAND<br /><br />\nPiScuS5 if 06/ff Aok.\"<br /><br />\nHE-uo?<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nTwice a week, a huge stack of<br />\nmail arrives at the Gatehouse,<br />\nmostly accumulated in our<br />\nGilman box after our Tuesday<br />\nand Wednesday business hours.<br />\nAlong with stacks of bills,<br />\npayments for ads, Cuban propaganda newspapers and the like,<br />\nwe also receive copies of student<br />\nnewspapers<br />\nfrom<br />\nother<br />\nuniversities.<br />\nOne particularly impressive<br />\nnewspaper is the CarnegieMellon University Tartan, which<br />\narrives in the full-color glory that<br />\nonly a university with a first-class<br />\nart department and all the accompanying graphics abilities can<br />\nmuster.

Both have reputations for<br />\nputting social life on the back<br />\nburner. Interestingly, CarnegieMellon's longtime President,<br />\nRichard Cyert, acclaimed for expanding and diversifying the<br />\nUniversity, has resigned, citing<br />\nthe need to move on. And like<br />\nHopkins, C.M.U. is deeply involved in Defense Department<br />\nresearch.<br />\nTake a look at the front page of<br />\na recent Tartan:<br />\nPresident Cyert resigned last<br />\nfall.

Four students from each<br />\nundergraduate college will be<br />\nnominated for the committee by<br />\nthe student Senate (there are five<br />\ncolleges), as well as representatives from their versions of<br />\nGALA, the BSU, the IFC, and<br />\nthe Dormitory Council.<br />\nThis is no bogus committee. It<br />\nis a subcommittee of the faculty<br />\nsearch committee for the new<br />\nPresident. Together, they will<br />\nconfer on a list of potential candidates, which will then be<br />\npresented to the Board of<br />\nTrustees.<br />\nOn a less dramatic and positive<br />\nnote, C.M.U. is also running into problems with social programming which conflicts with state liquor laws. The University had an<br />\n80-year tradition called the Beaux<br />\nArts Ball, an all-night dance held<br />\nevery four years. Once located in<br />\nthe College of Fine Arts, the Ball<br />\nwas cancelled this year due to the<br />\nfact that \"no faculty member or<br />\nadministrator is willing to take the<br />\nresponsibility for the successful<br />\nmanagement of alcohol.\" Could<br />\nwe be living in a parallel<br />\nacademic universe?<br />\nThe Tartan issue was replete<br />\nwith reported protests about<br />\nC.M.U.'s defense-related Software Engineering Institute (think<br />\nAPL) and concern over the success of the upcoming freshman<br />\norientation.<br />\nThere was also a color photo on<br />\nthe front page captioned: \"Junior<br />\nhistory major Stacey Stancill, a<br />\nperennial favorite, gets annointed<br />\nin chocolate syrup after her victory in Scotland Yard'.<br />\nSee PSEUDO, 7<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nKathleen McCarthy, Florence Ware<br />\nJonathan Engler, Julie Levine<br />\nDiana Zeiger<br />\nPatrick Doherty<br />\nVensive Lamb, Jonathan Stempel<br />\nMark W.

Recent research shows that<br />\nwomen earn slightly higher GPAs<br />\nthan men in the same college<br />\nlargely because they tend to take<br />\ncourses that are graded a little<br />\nhigher.<br />\n2. By using separate \"regression\" equations for predicting<br />\nGPAs, one can readily eliminate<br />\nprediction \"bias.\" That is, the<br />\nstatistically best-weighted combination of predictors usually<br />\nwon't be quite the same for<br />\nwomen as for men.<br />\n3. Virtually any quantifiable<br />\npredictors may be entered into the<br />\nprediction equation. The following usually produce moderately<br />\nhigh correlations with GPAs:<br /><br />\nlank in high school graduating<br />\nclass, SAT-V score, and SAT-M<br />\nscore, and the averagc of scores<br />\non the College Board achievement test the student took (usually at least three).<br />\n4. The college grades of blacks<br />\ntend to be somewhat overpredicted when in a particular<br />\nsituation one uses the optimallyweighted set of predictors based<br />\non whites; blacks tended to have<br />\nsomewhat lower GPAs than<br />\nthe equation predicts. This can be<br />\navoided by using one prediction<br />\nequation for blacks and another<br />\nfor whites, to \"fit\" each group<br />\nbest.<br />\n5. I have not studied prediction<br />\nfor hispanics, but the same principles would apply to it.<br />\n6. One might, of course, also<br />\ntry other variables experimentally to determine what, if anything,<br />\nthey would contribute to predicting GPAs better, such as the<br /><br />\n,re, socio-economic<br />\n5Latus, distance from the college<br />\nthat the student's home is (the farther the better?), father's. and/or<br />\nmother's level of education,<br />\nethnicity, number of graduates in<br />\nthe student's high school class,<br />\nnumber of honors courses taken<br />\nin high school, etc.<br />\n7. Various outcomes might be<br />\npredicted: first semester GPA,<br />\nfreshman year GPA, cumulative<br />\nGPA at graduation, number of<br />\nsemesters needed to graduate,<br />\nreceiving departmental honors vs.<br />\nnot, staying at Hopkins vs. leaving before graduation, etc. It is<br />\neven feasible to predict the major field of study in which the student is likely to graduate. The<br />\npredictors for that might appreciably differ from those that<br />\npredict GPA the best.<br />\n8. Finally, what kind(s) of<br />\n\"bias\" was Ms. Anne Langley<br />\ntrying to discuss?

The<br />\nUniversity should be led by its<br />\nfaculty; we can no longer afford<br />\nto have the University run by the<br />\nunaccountable corporate management as if it were a business.<br /><br />\nproposed by the Five-Year Plan.<br />\nIf the University wants to balance<br />\nthe budget on our backs (saving<br />\nmoney by using graduate students<br />\nrather than full faculty to teach)<br />\nwe demand just compensation<br />\nand involvement in how the new<br />\nsystem is set up and operated.<br />\n5.

And while there has<br />\nbeen criticism of the administration's Plan from faculty and<br />\nstudents alike, a sense of perspective is needed to place Hopkins<br />\nwhere it belongs in a wide range<br />\nof other top-level universities.<br />\nThese universities, among the<br />\nbest in the nation, have been<br />\nundergoing similar difficulties in<br />\nrecent years, although each has<br />\nadapted its divisional structure to<br />\ntry to accomodate the pressures<br />\nit faces. Hopkins exists on one<br />\nend of the spectrum of universities in its decentralization of<br />\ndivisions. In most universities,<br />\ndivisions are more centrally funded than Hopkins and each has<br />\ndeveloped its own methods for<br />\nallocating funds to where they are<br />\nmost needed,just as Hopkins has<br />\ndeveloped its Five-Year Plan.<br />\nAccording to Provost John<br />\nLombardi, the history of<br />\nHopkins's divisional structure<br />\ntraces back to its inception, when<br />\nthere were two original<br /><br />\ndivisions\u2014Arts and Sciences and<br />\nthe School of Medicine. Over the<br />\nyears, other divisions were formed, each with its own financial<br />\nresources so that they would not<br />\nbe taking resources away from<br />\nprevious divisions. The addition<br />\nand removal of divisions has been<br />\nan organic, changing process, as<br />\nthe administration has historically collapsed weaker ones and<br />\nlater revived them when they<br />\nwere more financially sound.<br />\nEach division thus becomes a<br />\nself-contained part of the whole,<br />\nand can design the tightest set of<br />\nprograms possible. Everything a<br />\ndivision saves, it can keep and<br />\nspend on its own projects. Thus<br />\nthere is an incentive to be<br />\neconomical in internal budgeting<br />\nand, according to Lombardi,<br />\nthere is no infighting between<br />\ndivisions over university funds.<br />\nFrom a historical perspective,<br />\nwhere most universities have<br />\ngrown<br />\nfrom<br />\ncentral<br />\na<br />\nundergraduate school from<br />\nwhich many graduate programs<br />\nhave developed, Hopkins's<br />\nundergraduate school had<br />\ndeveloped as an overlap of successful graduate schools such as<br />\nEngineering and Medicine. The<br />\nFive-Year Plan was the product<br />\nof the need to raise money to support Arts and Sciences\u2014through<br />\nthe creation of a reserve fund, the<br /><br />\ncutting of faculty by ten percent,<br />\na tuition differential system, and<br />\nthe postponing of renovations to<br />\nuniversity facilities. The Medical<br />\nSchool will contribute a substantial portion of the reserve fund,<br />\nfrom its surpluses, and these<br />\nfunds will go toward helping Arts<br />\nand Sciences, by funding Library<br />\nmaintenance and other expenses<br />\nthat it must normally cover.<br />\nOther universities have different structures, although many<br />\nof them face the same problems<br />\nas Hopkins. According to Dr<br />\nMargaret Bates, vice-provost at<br />\nDuke University, for example,<br />\nthe university has a mixed model<br />\nof centralization and decentralization. Some schools within the<br />\nuniversity are allocated money<br />\nbased on a formula agreement,<br />\nwithin which they are free to<br />\nbudget their own departments.<br />\nOther schools within the University are allocated money based on<br />\na formula agreement, within<br />\nwhich they are free to budget<br />\ntheir own departments. Other<br />\nschools in the university are subject to complete centralized control by the administration. Formula agreements are flexible and<br />\nsubject to alterations, some of<br />\nwhich are currently being considered.<br />\nContinued next week<br /><br />\nEly Brown<br /><br />\nLast Sunday, Brian Goldberg won $100 in the backgammon tournament.<br /><br />\nBrian Goldberg takes first place<br />\nin backgammon tournament<br />\nby Deena Dizengoff<br />\nOn Sunday, April 2, at 12:30<br />\np.m., the Garrett Room of the<br />\nMSE Library was filled with the<br />\nsounds of rolling dice and moving checkers.

April 1.<br />\nFollowing the keynote address on<br />\nNew Concepts of Cancer,\u2014 a<br />\ngroup of undergraduate researchers had opportunities to give<br />\npresentations about their research<br />\nprojects.<br />\nThe very distinguished keynote<br />\nspeaker, Dr. Donald S. Coffey,<br />\ndiscussed the history and direction of cancer research. As a Professor of Urology, Professor of<br />\nOncology, and a Professor of<br />\nPharmacology and Molecular<br />\nSciences, he is the first triple professor at Johns Hopkins. His lecture, entitled \"New Concepts of<br />\nCancer,\" described how cancer<br />\nresearch has grown over the past<br />\nfifty years and where it is headed. He began by describing a<br />\nbenign tumor as 'anything that<br />\ngrows in the body as a closed<br />\nfist.\" He continued the idea by<br />\nsaying that \"anything that looks<br />\nlike a crab is invading [other cells<br />\nand organs]; it's malignant.\" Dr.<br />\nCoffey then went on to list many<br />\ncancers that seem to have cures,<br />\nor \"exhibit complete retardation<br />\nupon treatment.\" These include<br />\nHodgkin's disease, neuroblastoma, Wilm's tumor<br />\nand Burkitt's lymphoma. Dr.<br />\nCoffey explains that varieties of<br />\ncancer that don't have cures yet,<br /><br />\nlike lung and breast cancer, can<br />\nonly be treated by removal if<br />\nfound early enough.<br />\nAn interesting characteristic of<br />\ncancer cells is that they \"become<br />\nresistant to every treatment<br />\nmade,\" whereas normal ce:ls do<br />\nnot. Furthermore, the resistance<br />\nis apparent both in the \"presence<br />\nand the absence of the chemical.\"<br />\nAnother important characteristic<br />\nassociated with cancer is that, due<br />\nto their genetic instability, each of<br />\nthe cancer cells develop<br />\n\"heterogeneity.\" This means that<br />\neach cell in a cancerous growth<br />\nhas different genetic characteristics than other cells in.<br />\nthat growth., although they all<br />\ncame from the same original<br />\ncells. Dr. Coffey used an analogy<br />\nto explain this. Imagine, he said,<br />\nan apple seed taken from a crab<br />\napple. When it's planted and the<br />\ntree comes up, you'll see red<br />\ndelicious apples on one branch,<br />\ngolden delicious apples on<br />\nanother, '`crab apples over here,<br />\nand Washington State apples over<br />\nthere!\"<br />\nAfter conveying the importance<br />\nof genetic instability of cancer<br />\ncells. Dr. Coffey described how<br />\nnormal cells die regularly,<br />\nwhereas cancer cells do not self<br />\ndestruct. This is once again<br />\nrelated to the genetic instability of<br />\nthe cancer cells. In normal cells,<br />\n\"there is a code somewhere that<br />\ntells it to die.\" This apparently is<br />\nnot the case in cancerous cells.<br />\nDr. Coffey explains further that<br /><br />\nthis research led to the idea of<br />\nmorphological instability in<br />\ncancerous cells. In every \"normal cell [nucleus], there exists a<br />\nstructural backbone. . . called the<br />\nnuclear matrix.\" This matrix is<br />\nvery important in handling all the<br />\nDNA that exists in the nucleus.<br />\n'The DNA uses this backbone to<br />\ncode for proteins,''and this very<br />\nbackbone is \"out of whack\" in<br />\ncancerous cells.<br />\nAnother concept that is recently being studied \"quite a lot deals<br />\nwith the mobility\" of cancerous<br />\ncells. The fact that cancer cells<br />\ncan move distinguishes them<br />\nfrom most other cells. Dr. Coffey explained how scientists in the<br />\nOncology Lab at the Medical<br />\nSchool, using Fourier analysis,<br />\nhave described the motion of a<br />\ncell in a mathematical equation.<br />\nThis is important progress since<br />\nmany more studies can now be<br />\ndone with computer simulation of<br />\ncancer cell mobility.<br />\nAnother subject addressed in<br />\nDr. Coffey's speech was the importance of thinking in research.<br />\nDr. Coffey said that although he's<br />\nnot the brightest of people, naying \"failed the fifth gradc . and<br />\ngraduated from a teachers' college in Tennessee\" with<br />\nmediocre grades, he can \"think<br />\nand work with people.\u2014 He explains that when going through<br />\nschool, all the \"good engineers<br />\nand scientists can answer the<br />\nquestions and solve the problems<br />\nat the back of the chapters,\" but<br /><br />\nwhen they do research \"they<br />\ndon't know which chapters to<br />\napply to their problems.\u2014 He emphasized the ability to think as a<br />\n\"major research tool\" that we all<br />\nhave. Dr. Coffey continued, \"in<br />\ndoing research,[you must answer<br />\nonly two questions:] first, when<br />\nyou see something,[ask] what its<br />\nimplication is; and second, what's<br />\nthe reason behind the event.\"<br />\nWith these messages, and an<br />\noverview of cancer research, Dr.<br />\nCoffey left for another meeting<br />\nwhere he had to give another<br />\nspeech.<br />\nFollowing this lecture, several<br />\nHopkins undergraduates gave<br />\npresentations on research that<br />\nthey themselves were conducting.<br />\nStephen Tsang, president of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Chapter of the<br />\nAmerican Chemical Society. says<br />\nthat this \"is an excellent opportunity for students to practice giving speeches.\" He explained that<br />\nas \"students go higher in [their]<br />\nschooling, they have to give more<br />\nand more seminar:, and this informal practice helps them quite<br />\na tot.\" Stephen then offered<br />\nthanks to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nChemistry Department for funding the symposium and giving<br />\nthese researchers such an<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nThe first speaker was senior<br />\nKen Grimm, who discussed his<br />\nresearch on \"Photodynamic<br />\nTherapy.\u2022\u2022 George Kao followed<br />\nby talking about the \"SelfDiffusion of Intracellular Water\"<br /><br />\nin special fetal fibroblasts. Next,<br />\nJohn Higgins described his<br />\nresearch on the \"Ligand Binding<br />\nof Antigen-Receptor Associations.\" Miki hoh than talked<br />\nabout the \"Sulfur Metabolism\"<br />\nin special bacteria, and Chang<br />\nLee related the importance of<br />\nNMR Studies in the determination of \"Thymidine<br />\nGlycol.\" Other students and their<br />\ntopics of research included Ani<br />\nKetabigian and \"The MacroOrganization\"<br />\nmolecular<br />\nof repetitive DNA sequences,<br />\nMichael L.

Once Hedgecock<br />\nknows a gene exists, he can<br />\nchoose among several methods to<br />\nfind it within the worm's<br />\nchromosomes. Occasionally,<br />\nHedgecock will clone the genes<br />\nof the mutant and of a normal<br />\nworm, and compare the proteins<br />\nthey produce.

THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN<br />\nDROOD<br />\nis based on Charles Dickens's unfinished novel of the<br />\nsame<br />\nname. The premise of the show is this: The Music Hall Royale,<br />\na Victorian age acting troupe, is attempting a production of the<br />\nDickens work. When they reach the point in the mystery when<br />\nCharles Dickens \"lay down his pen forever,\" the troupe makes<br />\nthe \"dangerously democratic\" move of allowing you, the<br />\naudience, to vote on certain key plot questions. The troupe then<br />\ndoes its best to create an ending to fit the wishes of the audience.<br />\nBelieve it or not, there are over 500 possible endings to the<br />\nmystery! And yes, the members of the Music Hall Royale are<br />\nprepared to perform each and every one of them. Thus, DROOD<br />\nis actually a different show each night.

But for his trademark<br />\nwordplay and piercing sarcasm,<br />\nCostello's LP might be the work<br />\nof a brash, precocious new talent.<br />\nMore to the point, however,<br />\nSpike is a clear success. The arrangements on the album are<br />\nCostello's best to date; whether<br />\nin the letter-perfect pop of<br />\n\"Veronica\" or the neo-Motown<br />\nsound of \"Coal-Train Robberies,\" the words and music<br />\nlock together neatly. Session<br />\nmusicians ranging from Paul<br />\nMcCartney to wild guitarist Marc<br />\nRibot give Costello an enormous<br />\nrange of options; his previous<br />\nalbums are drab by comparison.<br />\nLike co-producers T-Bone<br />\nBurnett and Keven Killen,<br />\nCostello has a deadly ear: he<br />\nknows just when arrangements<br />\nget too heavy, and keeps the<br />\nalbum pleasantly chaotic.<br />\nLyrically, the changes are less<br />\ndrastic. The \"emotional fascism\"<br />\nthat fed Costel;o's lyrics for a<br />\ndecade has been replaced, on<br />\nroughly half of \"Spike,\" by<br />\nissues further from the heart and<br />\nmind. In \"Tramp the Dirt<br />\nDown,\" an open letter of sorts to<br />\nMargaret Thatcher, Costello<br />\nreports his desire to live a long<br />\nlife. Trite? Not exactly, for then,<br />\nover acoustic guitar and fiddle, he<br /><br />\noffers Thatcher his reason: \"I'd<br />\nlike to live long enough to<br />\nsavor/. . . when they finally put<br />\nyou in the ground/I'll stand on<br />\nyour grave and tramp the dirt<br />\ndown.\"<br />\nMuch of Spike is equally<br />\ncaustic. \"Let Him Dangle\" reexamines the facts of a British<br />\nmurder trial in which Derek<br />\nBentley was hanged for ordering<br />\na minor, Christopher Craig, to<br />\nkill a man. Costello recounts both<br />\nsides of the case with mounting<br />\nexasperation, punctuating each<br />\nverse with the cry, \"let him<br />\ndangle!\" The song's \"murky and<br />\nperky\" arrangement drips with<br />\nirony, and Marc Ribot's spidery<br />\nguitar acts as an eerie collaborator<br />\nfor the \"bloodthirsty chorus\" the<br />\nsong describes.<br />\n\"Pads, Paws, and Claws\" and<br />\n\"Veronica,\" which Costello<br />\nwrote with Paul McCartney, are<br />\ngenuinely fun\u2014a quality which,<br />\nhowever strange its form, has<br />\nlong been the key to Costello's<br />\nwork. But Spike, somehow, is<br />\nmore austere than any of<br />\nCostello's earlier albums, which<br />\nmay repel longtime fans at first.<br />\nIts more whimsical side\u2014found<br />\nin the astonishing wordplay and<br />\ntongue-in-cheek instrumentation\u2014is there, to be sure,<br />\nbut unveiling it takes some<br />\neffort.<br />\nOf the album's fifteen songs<br />\n(fourteen on LP), at least ten are<br />\noutstanding.

They<br />\ncouldn't possibly have thought<br />\nthey could get away with upsetting Hopkins in the quarterfinals<br />\nof the NCAA Tournament. Surely, the top-ranked Blue Jays<br />\nwould get their revenge.<br />\nYet even the Wahoos couldn't<br />\nhave predicted just how complete<br />\nthat revenge would be. Johns<br />\nHopkins dominated play on both<br />\nends of the field last Saturday,<br />\nscoring five unanswered goals in<br />\nthe first quarter and seven in the<br />\nsecond half to pull away for a<br />\n12-3 victory here at Homewood.<br />\nVirginia got off to a fast start,<br />\nas All-American midfielder Andy Kraus won the opening faceoff and Rob Schmaltz scored the<br />\ngame's first goals just thirty<br />\nseconds into the first quarter.<br />\nKraus's ability to control the<br />\nfaceoffs had worried the Hopkins<br />\ncoaches all week, but when he<br />\nwas forced to leave the game with<br />\nan injury early in the quarter, the<br />\nBlue Jays took control.<br />\n\"I thought we'd have trouble<br />\nagainst Kraus because he does a<br />\ngood job of controlling the<br />\nfaceoffs,\" said Hopkins Coach<br />\nDon Zimmerman. \"But when he<br />\nwent out in the first [quarter], it<br />\nallowed us to control the tempo.\"<br />\nThe Jays' domination began at<br />\nthe 1:40 mark of the first quarter,<br />\nwhen Matt Panetta fed Brendan<br />\nKelly to tie the game. Panetta<br />\nadded a goal of his own two<br /><br />\nminutes later, and then Hopkins<br />\nbegan to pull away. Consecutive<br />\ngoals by Joe Rzempoluch, Jeff<br />\nIhm, and John Wilkens gave the<br />\nBlue Jays a commanding 5-1 lead<br />\nbefore the first quarter had<br />\nexpired.<br />\nBut the Hopkins offense fell<br />\nasleep in the second quarter as<br />\nthey strayed from their game<br />\nplan, and failed to score for the<br />\nfinal 19:21 of the half. The<br />\nWahoos failed to capitalize,<br />\nhowever, as Quint Kessenich and<br />\nthe Blue Jays defense completely<br />\nshut down their scoring attack.<br />\nThough the Cavaliers scored with<br />\njust one second remaining in the<br />\nhalf to make the score 5-2,<br />\nHopkins survived their scoring<br />\nlull without any serious damage.<br />\nThe defense continued to<br />\ndominate in the second half,<br />\nrecording their fourth thirdquarter shutout of the season.<br />\nOriginally thought to lack depth<br />\nat the beginning of the season, the<br />\nJays' defensive unit has emerged<br />\nas the finest in the country, led by<br />\nseniors Dave Pietramala, Greg<br />\nLilly, Steve Ciccarone, ail(' Pat<br />\nRussell. On Saturday, they blanked the Wahoos for 29:25 in the<br />\nsecond half, allowing Hopkins to<br />\npull away with seven unanswered<br />\ngoals. When Virginia finally<br />\nmanaged to score with only<br />\nthirty-five seconds remaining in<br />\nthe game, it was too late to keep<br />\nHopkins from winning their fourteenth straight regular season game.<br />\nThe Blue Jays spread the scoring around on Saturday, as nine<br /><br />\nplayers scored goals. Brendan<br />\nKelly and Mau Panetta led the<br />\nway for Hopkins with two goals<br />\nand an assist apiece. Joe Rzempoluch added two goals and<br />\nfreshman Brian Lukacz made two<br />\nassists for the Jays.<br />\nTomorrow Hopkins will travel<br />\nto Chapel Hill to face their biggest rival, North Carolina. Seven<br />\nof the last eight games these two<br />\nteams have played have been<br />\ndecided by one goal, including<br />\nlast year's 6-5 win by Hopkins<br />\nhere at Homewood. The game<br />\nwill be played on natural grass at<br />\nKenan Stadium following<br />\nCarolina's annual Blue-White<br />\nspring football scrimmage.<br />\nBecause the Blue Jays play and<br />\npractice mostly on artificial turf,<br />\nthis could give the Tar Heels a<br />\nslight advantage, especially if the<br />\ngrass is wet and chewed up from<br />\nthe football game.<br />\nCarolina fell from third to fifth<br />\nin the polls last week after a 5-4<br />\nloss to Maryland at College Park.<br />\nAlthough they controlled the action on both ends of the field, the<br />\nHeels couldn't seem to score<br />\ngoals. But their defense, which<br />\nhad been struggling early in the<br />\nyear, came into its own last week<br />\nand could spell trouble for<br />\nHopkins, especially if the Jays<br />\nhave trouble adjusting to the<br />\nnatural surface.<br />\nTomorrow's game will be the<br />\nfifteeth meeting between Hopkins<br />\nand Carolina, with the Blue Jays<br />\nholding a slim 8-6 series edge.<br /><br />\nUSILA DIVISION I COACHES'POLL<br />\n(First place votes in parentheses)<br />\nTeam<br />\n1.

The Jays were<br />\nvictorious in both games, posting<br />\nscores of 4-2 and 7-6,<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nJason Klintenic started the<br />\ngame for Hopkins. The lefthanded senior pitched six and twothirds innings, giving up only one<br />\nearned run. Captain Scott Tarantino came in to pick up the last out<br />\nand the save.<br />\nUntil the top of the sixth, the<br />\nscoring was all Hopkins. Centerfielder Mike Zehrig led off the<br />\nbottom of the first with a double<br />\nto left center. He moved over to<br />\nthird on an out by the designated<br />\nhitter, Ron Lewis. The first run<br />\nof the game scored on the next<br />\nplay, as second baseman Andy<br />\nBernstein sacrifice flied to center<br />\nfield.<br />\nIn the bottom of the fourth inning, an error by Widener's<br />\nshortstop put leadoff batter Jim<br />\nTimmerman on base. Leftfielder<br />\nAndy Nicholas followed up with<br />\na single that pushed Timmerman<br />\nto second base. Firstbaseman Ken<br />\nBrodkowitz successfully completed a sacrifice bunt, which<br />\nmoved the runners to second and<br />\nthird. Rob Moses, rightfielder,<br />\nhit a sacrifice fly to score Jim<br />\nTimmerman, the first run of the<br />\ninning. Catcher Pete Kwiterovich<br />\ncame up with a timely double,<br />\nwhich scored Andy Nicholas.<br />\nAnother error on Widener's<br />\nshortstop brought in Kwiterovich<br /><br />\nfor the third run and put John<br />\nHorner on base. Horner proceeded to steal second base, but was<br />\nleft stranded there.<br />\nThe final score of game one<br />\nwas 4-2.
