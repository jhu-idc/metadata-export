fac-<br />\n<br />\nulty members have protested the<br />\ncut. \"I feel that the Library<br />\nshould be cut last,\" he said. \"After all, it is the central area of<br />\ncampus activity, and the reserves<br />\nare located there.\"<br />\nLovejoy said that though he<br />\nrealizes the Library must be subject to some curtailment of services as part of campus-wide fuel<br />\nconservation measures, he considers the 25 hour cut \"excessive.\"<br />\nIn response to suggestions that<br />\nthe operating hours of specified<br />\nareas of the Library rather than<br />\nthe entire facility be reduced,<br />\nStam said that the \"vertical zone<br />\nheating system\" which heats the<br />\nbuilding would make such an approach infeasible.<br />\n\"Let's face it,\" he said. \"This<br

Now, a<br />\ncumultive GPA of 3.5 is minimumi for just about every<br />\nschool,\" he stated.<br />\nDebuskey commented that he<br />\nthought the higher statistics are<br />\nthe result, of a rapid increase in<br />\nthe number of medical school applicants.<br />\n\"I just finished meeting with<br />\ndirectors from 18 medical<br />\nschools, to see if there was some<br />\nuniform standard.

I was<br />\nappalled, as I expect, many people<br />\nare at seeing such signs of vandalism. It is really hard for me to believe that such irresponsible idiots<br />\n(probably students, primarily undergraduates) who are supposed to<br />\nbe the leaders of tomorrow, i.e.,<br />\nthe doctors, lawyers, and teachers,<br />\nare the ones responsible for this.<br />\nYet that is the conclusion that I<br />\nmusLreach. Yet the University itself is responsible. When earlier<br />\nacts Of vandalism and thievery occurred at the Rathskellar and elsewhere, the University slightly rapped the knuckles of a few of the<br />\noffenders. Instead of making these<br />\nstudents clean up the Rathskellar<br />\nafter closing time, they should<br />\nhave been expelled, maybe at the<br />\nvery least, suspended for one<br />\nsemester. Yet the University didn't<br />\ntake this approach (perhaps afraid<br />\nto lose a few thousand dollars in<br />\ntuition), instead preferring to assume that students are responsible<br />\nand by explaining how prices go up<br />\nevelytime something is stolen or<br />\nvandalized. I think it is obvious<br />\nthat this approach has failed.

Now, a<br />\ncumultive GPA of 3.5 is minimumi for just about every<br />\nschool,\" he stated.<br />\nDebuskey commented that he<br />\nthought the higher statistics are<br />\nthe result, of a rapid increase in<br />\nthe number of medical school applicants.<br />\n\"I just finished meeting with<br />\ndirectors from 18 medical<br />\nschools, to see if there was some<br />\nuniform standard. They were all<br />\nconcerned with the increase to<br />\n45,000 students applying for<br />\n15,000' places. That's a one in<br />\nthree chance of acceptance,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\nThe new chairman revealed<br />\nthat five years ago 30,000 students were applying for the same<br />\nnumber of openings\u2014a one in two<br />\nchance of acceptance.<br />\nIn view of this competition,<br />\nDebuskey said that the purpose<br /><br />\nof the committee is to provide<br />\nadditional information to admissions offices besides the numerical score from the GPA and the<br />\nMCATs.<br />\n\"Other traits are important in<br />\nmedicine. Our committee extracts facts from solicited letters<br />\nand reports to form the basis of a<br />\nreview on the virtues of the applicants,\" the chairman explained.<br />\nHe added that the objective of<br />\nthe 20-member committee is to<br /><br />\nstress an applicant's strong points<br />\nand to explain posssible falterings<br />\nin numerical scores.<br />\nHowever, Debuskey expressed<br />\nconcern that the recent federal<br />\nlaw, proposed by Senator<br />\nBuckley, allowing students to see<br />\ntheir school files, will diminish<br />\nthe effect of these recommendations.<br />\n\"If we send recommendation s<br />\nsaying everyone's! is a real 'jewel'<br />\nand they prove to be just 'paste',<br /><br />\nthen eventually admissions offices will just ignore them and<br />\nrely even more on numerical<br />\nscores,\" he asserted.<br />\nDebuskey revealed, however,<br />\nthat this situation may be<br />\nremedied by a proposed amendment to the bill, which alIbws a<br />\nschool to ask a student fpr a<br />\nwaiver stating that he will not request his files.<br />\n\"This waiver, if implemented,<br />\nwill also not allow students to see<br /><br />\ntheir files at schools, at the time<br />\nthey are applying,\" he noted.<br />\n\"Only after they have enrolled,<br />\nwhen it doesn't really matter,<br />\nwill students be allowed tc see<br />\ntheir files.\"<br />\n\"I hope to be accessible anytime and to review the records of<br />\npre-med students after their third<br />\nsemester.

Just as serious, the<br />\nLibrary will cease to be a reliable and accessible study<br />\narea\u2014independent of its resources\u2014for students who<br />\nfrequently have no other refuge.<br />\nWe urge that the implications of the proposed cut be<br />\nreconsidered by the appropriate officials before such a<br />\nDraconian measure is enforced.,<br /><br />\nCome get lost in Brubeck's redwood expanse!<br />\nBy JOHN HOLDREN<br />\nMeet Dave Brubeck: oh, but<br />\ndon't shake hands\u2014 your stubby<br />\nlittle fingers are likely to get lost<br />\namong the redwood expanse of<br />\nthose great hands, hands that hang<br />\nwith an almost embarrassing gawkiness at the side of the silver-haired<br />\nfigure, who, with his jolly smile<br />\nand gleaming eyes, stands looking<br />\nlike an underweight and clean-shaven Santa Claus (and, in the<br />\nworld of jazz, is a figure of no less<br />\nmythic proportions). Any sense of<br />\nawkwaruness or embarrassment<br />\ndisappears, however, when that figure seats himself, and those hands,<br />\nthe hands of an artist, begin to elicit from the black and white palette before him a kaleidoscopic<br />\ncollage of sound that speaks to our<br />\nears and bodies....<br />\nSuch, at least, are one fan's enthusiastic impressions of Dave<br />\nBrubeck and his music.
