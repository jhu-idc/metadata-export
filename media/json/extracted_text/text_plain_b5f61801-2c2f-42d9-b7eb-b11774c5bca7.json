The positive economic hazard to national<br />\nstability is a far more pertinent<br />\nquestion than the problematic security offered by armaments of such<br />\ndimensions.

The positive economic hazard to national<br />\nstability is a far more pertinent<br />\nquestion than the problematic security offered by armaments of such<br />\ndimensions. Adequate national defense is imperative to national integrity, but the building of gigantic<br />\ninstruments of war would inspire hatred, jealousy and suspicion in the<br />\nminds of other peoples.

Every major industry in this country can be converted to the manufacture of arms,<br />\nmunitions, and war supplies. Therefore, where is the line to be drawn<br />\nduring peacetime?

The size<br />\nof the ring is to be increased with the<br />\nyears. A young instructor may wear<br />\nonly a small ring through his nose<br />\nand that only of brass. Whereas the<br />\nhead of a department may wear a<br />\nhoop of gold. The bill further states<br />\nthat upon each ring the following information shall be engraved:<br />\n1\u2014Name. Born?

By the simple process of warning students when the professor is<br />\napproaching. The rustle of the ring<br />\nagainst the nasal bones will produce<br />\na distinct and definite sound to which<br />\nstudents will attune their ears, so<br />\nthat they will be amply warned.<br />\nMy second reason, is the right of<br />\nthe student when the lecture becomes<br />\nboring, to grab the professor by the<br />\nring, and lead him gently out of the<br />\nlecture room. You know the old saying, You can lead a professor to lecture, but you can't make him think.<br />\nMy third and most potent reason<br />\nwhy this bill should be signed by His<br />\nRoyal Roundness, Governor D.
