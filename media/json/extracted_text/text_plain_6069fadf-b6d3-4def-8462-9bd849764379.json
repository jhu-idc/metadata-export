The ad hoc group had<br />\ncollected about 1200 signatures from the<br />\nHopkins community on a petition towards that<br />\nend.<br />\nPresident Muller stated yesterday afternoon,<br />\nhowever, that the University would not reverse<br />\nIts stance and can do nothing about the charges<br />\nPending against those arrested at the Lyric.<br />\n\"The University is not prosecuting anybody;<br />\nit's in the hands of the state's attorney,\" Muller<br />\nsaid. \"I don't think there is anything I can<br />\nresponsibly do,\" he added.<br />\nAlthough Muller has not called a public<br />\nmeeting to respond to the widespread criticism<br />\nof the award, he is scheduled to speak in the<br />\nDorm social lounge on Monday night. \"Anything<br />\nbeyond that, I doubt; people have seen the<br />\nfaculty letter and .my statement,\" he asserted.<br />\nThe rally featured seven speakers, including<br />\ntwo people from the Iranian Student<br />\nAssociation. All ISA members wore masks for<br />\nfear of reprisal against their families in Iran.<br />\nAfter speeches by an ISA representative and<br />\nUniversity Chaplain Chester Wickwire, Professor<br />\nDavid Harvey questioned Muller's claim \"that he<br />\nhas no control\" over the charges. \"This is<br />\nerroneous\" he said. \"He can use his influence,<br />\nnot his authority. There's no question that the<br />\ncharges would then be dropped.\"<br />\nHarvey read the text of a letter signed by<br />\nthirty faculty members, which read, in part,<br />\n\"We, the undersigned members of The Johns<br />\nHopkins faculty, wish to protest and publicly<br />\n<br />\ndisassociate ourselves from the awarding of an<br />\nhonorary degree to Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, the<br />\nsister of the Shah of Iran.\" ( for the full text of<br />\nthe letter sec pg. 8)<br />\n\"If the award stands,\" Harvey continued,\"the<br />\nUniversity should issue a public statement that it<br />\ndoes not condone the policies of Iran.\" Although<br />\nMuller sent a personal reply to the faculty letter,<br />\nHarvey maintained that a general apology was<br />\nnecessary as well. Harvey went on to discuss the<br />\ngeneral position of the University, asserting that<br />\nit \"should not cave in to the pressures of those<br />\nwith power, privilege and fortune; rather,<br />\nconstantly struttle against these influences and<br />\ntry to assert its independence.\"<br />\nFinale<br />\nThe final speaker was Mike Hoffheimer, a<br />\nHopkins student who was arrested at the<br />\nConvocation. \"The question is not how the<br />\nchoice was made,\" he said, \"but that it was<br />\nmade. The real criminal is Ashraf, and the<br />\nadministration is complicitly approving her by<br />\ngranting the degree.\"<br />\nThe rally, however successful it was, has thus<br />\nfar done little to alter the Universit)4s policies<br />\nregarding the award. \"I didn't think we were<br />\nmaking a political statement,\" Muller<br />\ncommented. \"I did not and still do not regard<br />\nthe degree as an endorsement of Iran's policies.\"<br />\nWhen the honorary degree was proposed last<br />\nfall, Muller said that he did not think it would be<br />\nthat cmtroversial\u2022 However, he was not surprised<br />\nat the size of the rally and the number of<br />\npetition signatures. He acknowledged the<br />\nawareness of the community, but added that<br />\n\"compared to some of the things I've seen, this<br />\nwas a very orderly affair.\"<br />\nWhen asked if he made an error, Muller<br />\nreplied: \"It was my belief that we could<br />\nappropriately recognize the significant effort by<br />\nthe College of Health Sciences\u2014the effort in<br />\nwhich we are participating in\u2014to improve<br />\nmedical care for a badly neglected rural<br />\npopulation by awarding the degree to the titular<br />\nhead of all this in Iran, without taking a position<br />\non other<br />\n_ aspects of the government of Iran or its<br />\npolicies. This was a mistake on my part.\"<br />\nIn response to allegations that the degree was<br />\ngiven in hopes of Iranian grants to the<br />\nUniversity, Muller stated, \"there was no quid pro<br />\nquo.\" As for further University actions on the<br />\n<br />\nissue, Muller 'said, \"I don't really know what else<br />\ncan or will happen.\"<br />\nMark Hertsgaard, a spokesman for the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee, did not see the rally as a last step in<br />\nlight of the University's refusal to meet the<br />\ndemands of the petitions and letters. \"This<br />\nindicated a real disdain for the viewpoint<br />\nexpressed by the 1200 signatures; it's really<br />\ncontemptuous to not entertain an obviously<br />\nmajority opinion of the campus. Because of this<br />\ndisdain, members of the Hopkins Community<br />\nshould be appalled that the University is just not<br />\ntaking it seriously.\"<br />\nHertsgaard, who was \"ecstatic\" about the<br />\nsuccess of the rally and petitions, said that \"the<br />\nHopkins community clearly demonstrated their<br />\nfeelings on this issue. The University has to<br />\naccount for their actions, and should think<br />\nseriously about meeting the demands.\" After<br />\npresenting Muller with the petition, though, he<br />\nwas angered that the University \"did not<br />\nconfront the demands at all; they basically<br />\nignored us.\"<br />\n<br />\nISA representative speaks at rally<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/march 5, 1976<br />\n<br />\nChesapeake Women's Rugby Club<br />\nbegins active practices this Sunday,<br />\nMarch 7 at 10 a.m. on their home<br />\nfield.

Flannigan, rector of<br />\nSt. Mary Immaculate Church in<br />\nSpringfield said over<br />\nlong-distance, \"Massachusetts is<br />\nlike a woman. Fickle, my son,<br />\nvery fickle. One moment she can<br />\nbe warm and alluring like a loving mistress and then the next, she<br />\ncan be cold and frigid like the<br />\nCharles River in Jamiary. Stay<br />\naway from women, my son. You<br />\nknow, they taught us that at<br />\nHoly Cross and things have never<br />\nbeen better.\"<br />\nFather Flannigan, an old<br />\nfamily friend, had no viable<br />\nanswers to the questions raised<br />\nby Tuesday's Massachusetts<br />\nPrimary. A cold northwest gale<br />\nblew both snow and Henry<br />\n\"Scoop\" Jackson on top of this<br />\nrather motley heap of candidates.<br />\nMo Udall, the other great<br />\nArizona sage, finished a blase<br />\nsecond overall and first among<br />\nthe liberal hodgepodge.<br />\nFollowing close behind were the<br />\ntwo confederates, George C.<br />\nWallace and Jimmy Carter, trying<br />\nto prove their style of cornpone<br />\ngoes over big up north with them<br />\ndamn Yankees. Fred Harris, the<br />\nOklahoma oracle, was a weak<br />\nfifth with 8% of the vote but<br />\nmanaged to nose out Sargent<br />\nShriver who garnered only 7% of<br />\nhis \"home state\" ballots. After<br />\nShriver, nobody cares that Birch<br />\nBayh narrowly beat Ellen<br />\nMcComiack or that Milton Shapp<br />\npulled up lame and finished last.<br />\nBut what was so amazing<br />\n<br />\nabout the primary was that<br />\nnearly two thirds of the votes<br />\ncast were for conservative<br />\ncandidates. What? you query.<br />\nThis reactionary bote in<br />\nMassachusetts, the only state to<br />\ngo wild about McGovern back in<br />\n'72, the good old days? In the<br />\nwords of Desi Arnaz, \"Wha<br />\nhappened?\"<br />\n\"You must realize, my son,\"<br />\nFather Flannigan continued,<br />\n\"times are tougher now than<br />\nthey were then. You only had a<br />\nwar back then, and that was sort<br />\nof a dead issue because Nix.on<br />\nwas manipulating it to his own<br />\nends. But now, we get real issues,<br />\ngut issues that get people right<br />\nwhere they live. Listen: you got<br />\ninflation, recession,<br />\nunemployment, detente, an<br />\nappointed president, abortion,<br />\nand most of all here in the Great<br />\nBay State, busing.\"<br />\nBusin', as Wallace would have<br />\nit, caught Bean Town with its<br />\npants down. Rigidly \u2022segregated<br />\nneighborhoods were suddenly<br />\nobliged by the vagaries of the law<br />\nto change their way of racist<br />\nethnocentric education. God<br />\nforbid such tragedy would befall<br />\nthe bastion of liberalism, the<br />\nhome of liberty and the<br />\nKennedys. Bostonians proved<br />\nthemselves to be fast learners of<br />\nthe redneck way of protest.<br />\nWhich is why George Wallace<br />\nchose to make Massachusetts his<br />\nfirst primary, trying to capitalize<br />\nan emotional local issue into a<br />\nmandate for national viability of<br />\nhis candidacy. Political analysts<br />\n<br />\nScoop Jackson<br />\nhave a tendency to regard the<br />\nJohnson.\" True, Jackson was the<br />\npeople with a sort of only candidate to attract sizable<br />\ncontempuous condescension and<br />\nsupport form all factions of the<br />\nexpect them to vote on the<br />\nparty (as shown by a NBC news<br />\nflimsiest whims. The political<br />\npoll) but talk of this kind has all<br />\nthe smell of a man with delusions<br />\nsoothsayers expected Wallace to<br />\nof grandeur. At this stage of the<br />\nsweep Massachusetts easily and<br />\ngame, Jackson can only dream of<br />\nthrow the whole Democratic<br />\nParty into a frenzied dither.<br />\nsuch a coalition for Democratc<br />\nBut Henry Jackson, sporting a<br />\nhave a habit of being splintered<br />\nnew campaign style reminiscent<br />\nbefore the convention and then<br />\nof William Jennings Bryan and<br />\nsomehow all come together<br />\nBilly Graham, dashed Wallace's afterwards for the final thrust.<br />\ndreams. Waving his arms wildly<br />\nJackson is trying to buck nature<br />\nand preachin in an evangelical<br />\nand it simply won't wash.<br />\ntone, he spoke of forming a<br />\n\\ Big Mo<br />\n\"Grand Democratic Coalition in<br />\nMo Udall came out the big<br />\nthe tradition of Roosevelt, winner in last Tuesday's primary.<br />\nTruman, Kennedy, and<br />\nHe soundly trounced his closest<br />\n<br />\nliberal opponent, Fred Harris,<br />\nand suddenly became the darling<br />\nof the McGovernites. \"The smart<br />\nmoney's on Udall now,\" Father<br />\nFlannigan told me, \"and I'm<br />\ndonating all my winnings to Boys<br />\nTown.\"<br />\nJimmy Carter's campaign tvas<br />\nwounded by his poor fourth<br />\nplace showing. The effervescent<br />\nGeorgian tried to brush it off by<br />\nexplaining he really didn't<br />\ncampaign that hard but his front<br />\nrunner image certainly should<br />\nhave carried him further than it<br />\ndid. On Wednesday morning,<br />\npeanut reserves took a dive on<br />\nthe Chicago Farm market. Unless<br />\nCarter does well in Tuesday's<br />\nFlorida, his campaign is in<br />\ntrouble and probably lost.<br />\nNow we come to the dregs of<br />\nthe primary. Fred Harris has<br />\nstarted mumbling and is headed<br />\nfor the poorhouse. Sargent<br />\nShriver has proven the Kennedy<br />\nconnection no longer cuts any<br />\nmustard, not even in<br />\nMassachusetts. He should, as<br />\nJohnny Carson said, \"go back<br />\nparking polo-ponies.\" Birch<br />\nBayh, whose campaign never had<br />\nemough money or organization,<br />\nhas kindly withdrawn in favor of<br />\nthe other liberals. Ellen<br />\nMcCormack, the anti-abortionist,<br />\nwill never receive the nomination<br />\nI can safely predict.

CONSIDINE<br />\nEnter any record shop these<br />\ndays, and as you approach the<br />\ncash register to put yourself into<br />\nvinyl hock, you will notice<br />\nseveral magazines. Generally they<br />\nwill consist of Rolling Stone and<br />\nThe National Lampoon, with<br />\noccasional cameos by<br />\nCreern,Crawdaddy, Downbeat,<br />\nDifferent Drummer, Guitar<br />\nPlayer, Hi Fidelity,<br />\nGrammophone, Melody Maker,<br />\nand the ever popular Schwan,'<br />\nCatalog.<br />\nWell, what good are they? To<br />\nfind out, this courageous reporter<br />\nwaded through pages upon pages<br />\nof tabloid, photo spreads, and ad<br />\nCopy. What did he find? Not a<br />\nhell of alot.<br />\nJust in the interest of space,<br />\nthese remarks will be narrowed<br />\ndown to Crawdaddy, Creem,<br />\nDownbeat and Rolling Stone;<br />\nessentially \"rock\" magazines. But<br />\nthere's more than meets the .eye<br />\nin the term \"rock\" magazine.<br />\nTake for example, Creem.<br />\nCreem is \"America's Only<br />\nRock'n'Roll Magazine\" (it says<br />\nso on the cover). Creem is also<br />\nthe music world's News<br />\nAmerican. A genuine junk format<br />\ncomplemented by layout which<br />\nappears to be the work of<br />\nfour-year-olds, Crean has all the<br />\ntaste and elegance of Kiss in<br />\nconcert with the New York<br />\nDolls.<br />\nEssentially, Creem is the sort<br />\nof magazine one expects to find<br />\nin every Junior High School rest<br />\nroom. There are such features as<br />\n\"Kiss Comix\"; a gossip column<br />\nwhich makes Rhona Barrett seem<br />\nbearable; at least three stories per<br />\nissue on Elton John (one for, one<br />\nagainst, and the other switching<br />\npoles each month); and the<br />\nObligatory pictorial on The<br />\nTubes.<br />\nThis is first rate trash, the kind<br />\nof stuff that would do the<br />\nNational Enquirer proud. The<br />\nwriters generally seem to be<br />\nsmart enough. to know that it's<br />\ntrash, but not quite bright<br />\nenough to rise above it. As far as<br />\nself-indulgence goes, this rag tops<br />\neven 'Vat-Lamp. The<br />\nPhotography blows, and the<br />\narticles seem to have been hand<br />\nset by a man with Parkinson's<br />\ndisease, but the overall reak of<br />\nthis rag makes it somewhat<br />\nendearing. I mean, isn't this what<br />\nrock's all about?<br />\nStill, one can hardly respect a<br />\nmagazine who's Reader's Poll has<br />\nthe Stones as no. 1 R&B Group,<br />\nWith Earth, Wind, and Fire third.<br />\n(The Stones in the same category<br />\nas EW&F? C'mon!) And how<br />\nabout Jeff Beck's Blow by Blow<br />\nas the best Jazz album. Sure. And<br />\nLester Maddox digs James<br />\nBrOwn.<br />\nMoving into the realm of the<br />\nbasically sane, we have<br />\nDownbeat. Now Downbeat is a<br />\npeculiar case, because it is the<br />\noldest of any of these rags, dating<br />\nback to the thirties.<br />\nConsequently, the older<br />\nreadership has a tendency to<br />\nthink of Dombeat as a rock<br />\nmagazine, because of all the<br />\ncoverage they give to such<br />\nrockers as Chick Corea, John<br />\nMcLaughlin, Weather Report,<br />\nand Herbie Hancock. The<br />\n<br />\nyounger readers think this is a<br />\nreally hip magazine, 'cause it's<br />\ninto these cats, as well as some<br />\ndudes they've never heard of<br />\n(such as Cecil Taylor, Andrew<br />\nHill, Pepper Adams, Lee Konitz,<br />\netc.)<br />\nGet my drift? Downbeat is a<br />\nmusicians' magazine which<br />\nnon-musicians can read. The<br />\ninterviews are often the best<br />\naround, because they never waste<br />\ntime on shit like \"What was your<br />\nfirst gig?\" \"What was it like?\"...<br />\nTrouble is, there's only one<br />\nrock piece in it for every fifteen<br />\nor so jazz stories. And the record<br />\nreviews have a tendency to be<br />\nboth snotty and trendy (a<br />\ncurrent example is the feeling of,<br />\nIIif it's funky, it stinks.\"). But<br />\nthe music info and workshop tips<br />\nare invaluable, if you can use<br />\nthem.<br />\nCrawdaddy is the Newsweek<br />\nof this industry. It's slick, well<br />\nlaid out, well written, and<br />\ngenerally attractive. Except for<br />\none thing: It doesn't sell.<br />\nThe features in the magazine<br />\nare generally topical and tasteful,<br />\nwith some of the few intelligent<br />\npersonality pieces Rock<br />\nJournalism has produced (like<br />\ntheir recent Paul Simon<br />\ninterview). The record reviews<br />\napproach the status of art; a<br />\nrecent bit on Little Feat and<br />\nRobert Palmer was just brilliant<br />\nwriting. And \u2022 the jazz coverage<br />\n(an obvious attempt to gain class<br />\nby any rock magazine, hence an<br />\nexcellent focal point for<br />\nevaluation) is remarkably<br />\nknowledgeable, although<br />\nfashionably avant-garde.<br />\nBut it doesn't move. Its name,<br />\nfor one thing, sends off very bad<br />\nfeelings, awakening all of the<br />\nreaders unconscious disdain for<br />\nbluegrass and hillbilly music.<br />\nCrawdaddy; it just sounds like<br />\nhicks with banjos. And once you<br />\ndo get inside, there's the uneasy<br />\nfeeling of reading a Billboard<br />\npublication. Everything is slick,<br />\nand slick generally means<br />\n\"Record Company, PR Money.'<br />\nCrawdaddy is not bad; it is in the<br />\nunfortunate situation of being<br />\ntoo good for its genre.<br />\nAnd then there's Rolling<br />\nStone. It's very difficult to write<br />\nhere about Rolling Stone in a<br />\nderogatory fashion, because it's<br />\nkind of like supporting abortion<br />\nin an article for the Catholic<br />\nReview. But the mag has faults,<br />\nlike all institutions.<br />\nHow can anyone overlook the<br />\ngood which Rolling Stone has<br />\ndone? It gave us the Patty Hearst<br />\nstory. It gave us the best San<br />\nFrancisco rock journalism our<br />\nlittle pennies could buy. And it<br />\nkept Hunter Thompson off the<br />\nstreets.<br />\nStill, there are problems.<br />\nRolling Stone is trying very hard<br />\nto be rock's Village Voice , and<br />\nthat can be hard; after all, even<br />\nthe. Voice has trouble being the<br />\nVoice. But with Rolling Stone,<br />\nthe problem is that they rely<br />\nheavily upon personalities, and<br />\nnot all of those personalities<br />\nshould be relied on.<br />\nTake Nat Hentoff, for<br />\nexample. A man who's entire<br />\nexistence seems to be devoted to<br />\nbeing hip, Hentoff has always<br />\n<br />\nstruck me as a sort of Ralph<br />\nGleason without the business<br />\nsense. He knows alot of dudes,<br />\nbut he seems like the kind of guy<br />\nthey tolerate only because he'll<br />\nprint their name.<br />\nOr then there was the time<br />\ncovered the Ginsbergthey<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nDylan-Baez tour, and printed<br />\nsome poems Ginsberg read at<br />\nKerouac's grave. Which would<br />\nhave been pretty hip, unless you<br />\nread the poems. Allen 'Ginsberg<br />\nwriting fourty-five cent poems<br />\nfor an eighty-five cent magazine<br />\nis alot of things, but is it art?<br />\n<br />\nBut what do you expect?<br />\nRolling Stone isn't much, but it's<br />\nalmost all we've got. The record<br />\nreviews are good reading, and the<br />\ngossip column is interesting, so<br />\nwhy not? It may be a C+<br />\nmagazine, but C is a passing<br />\ngrade.<br />\n<br />\n-My books constituted my opening it, I had to rub it all over<br />\nmost serious problem: I had with a rag, even along the tops of<br />\narranged them on the etag?re, the pages, and then I had to give<br />\nand they were the only things it a good banging: a cloud of dust<br />\nthat gave me the impression this rose from it.

WARREN<br />\n\"The season of madness was<br />\nupon the city.\"-Wes Pardue<br />\nA good friend tells the story of<br />\nthree shopkeepers who walk the<br />\nstreets of New Orleans Mardi<br />\nGras day dressed as the Fates,<br />\nClotho, Lachesis, and Atropos,<br />\nsolemnly pronouncing death<br />\nsoon for some of the<br />\nmerrymakers and granting longer<br />\nlife for others. The celebration of<br />\nMardi Gras certainly embodies all<br />\nof the possibilities. It is a holiday<br />\nfor behaving as though you will<br />\nnever see tomorrow, and yet, you<br />\nare always looking forward to the<br />\nnext year--especially when it is all<br />\nover.<br />\nMardi Gras is a wild circus<br />\nturned open party, where it<br />\nbecomes difficult to distinguish<br />\nthe animals from the spectators.<br />\nThe balls--pompous excuses for<br />\nadults to behave like reckless<br />\nteenagers--begin as early as the<br />\nsixth of January when the<br />\nTwelfth Night Revelers officially<br />\nopen the season. Parades start<br />\nabout two weeks before Fat<br />\nTuesday, this year numbering<br />\nwell over fifty. An average<br />\nmember of any of these carnival<br />\norganizations,(called krewes),<br />\nmay spend anywhere from a few<br />\nhundred to several thousand<br />\ndollars for the privilege and thrill<br />\nof throwing trinkets to the<br />\ncrowds, or perhaps being king or<br />\nqueen for a day.<br />\nMardi Gras day, the final shot<br />\nat excess before Lent, has always<br />\nbeen for me a surprisingly good<br />\ntime. My expectations and<br />\nfantasies never quite materialize,<br />\nbut I soon forget what I thought<br />\nI was after, and become sucked<br />\nup by the dual orgy of body and<br />\nmind--never quite sure which half<br />\nof me is enjoying it more.<br />\nSo, when my slaved river of an<br />\neditor discovered that the<br />\nPrincess and I were throwing<br />\ndown our books and sloughing<br />\noff overdue papers to make the<br />\nlong-heralded Mardi Gras, he<br />\nquickly turned my vacation into<br />\na newspaper assignment.<br />\nIn the course of our<br />\nnegotiations, I discovered that<br />\nmy jefelamigo had been under<br />\ncertain illusions about my<br />\nlineage. I was born at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital and my parents<br />\nare from the Bronx. Having lived<br />\nin New Orleans for the last<br />\nthirteen years of my life, I feel a<br />\ngreat kinship with the South. But<br />\nthere is no truth to the rumors<br />\nthat I am a member of an<br />\naristocratic family, a direct<br />\ndescendant of some noble<br />\nSouthernwriter. My father is not<br />\neven a colonel.<br />\nIt would take native New<br />\nOrleanians--(pronounced,<br />\nNaw-1(e-nions)-to really show<br />\nthe Princess the magic of Mardi<br />\nGras.<br />\n<br />\nGoin' down<br />\n, It is a good twenty hour drive<br />\nfrom the swamps of Baltimore to<br />\nthe bayous of New Orleans. The<br />\n<br />\ntrip is usually a weary and dull<br />\nexperience, where one counts the<br />\nWaffle Houses and golden arches<br />\ndown the endless highway.<br />\nBathroom conditions tend to<br />\nvary with each state.<br />\nI never feel I am in the South<br />\nuntil I reach Alabama. True, the<br />\nPrincess and I heard the most<br />\namazing talk show in High Point,<br />\nNorth Carolina, where a young<br />\nboy with a thick accent tried to<br />\nconvince a dull-witted emcee that<br />\nCharles Lindbergh died in the<br />\nelectric chair; granted, that all of<br />\nthe waitresses in the truck stops<br />\nhave that remarkable ugliness<br />\nwith the piled-up hair and dented<br />\nfaces smiling when you place<br />\nyour order; but the South is<br />\nmore than hicks.<br />\n\u2022 Alabama, Mississippi and<br />\nLouisiana have a way of life<br />\nwhich is more than decadence-it<br />\nis hopeless bliss.<br />\nLike a scene from a Faulkner<br />\nnovel, it was therefore<br />\nappropriate that in the foggy<br />\ndawn of Saturday we entered the<br />\nhome state of George Corley<br />\nWallace. The mist appeared<br />\nominous but soon burnt away<br />\nunder the bright southern sun<br />\nwhich the Princess marveled at,<br />\nspeaking of high hopes to gain a<br />\nsuntan. I warned her it would \u2022<br />\nprobably rain.<br />\nGetting closer and closer to<br />\nthe Crescent City, the highway<br />\nspewed forth an onslaught of<br />\nStuckey's. This is pecan country.<br />\nPecan logs, pecan cakes, pecan<br />\npies, pecan ice cream, pecan<br />\ndolls, pecan hats, pecan<br />\nplaques--all at a remarkably<br />\nridiculous price. The radio<br />\ncrackled with Mardi Gras mambo<br />\nfrom radio station WTIX, the<br />\nmightly Tix (six) Ninety from<br />\nNew Orleans. Dr. John, The<br />\nMeters and Professor Longhair<br />\ntold me I was coming home. The<br />\n<br />\nPrincess had already learned the<br />\nwords to, \"They All Aksed For<br />\nYou.\"<br />\nA flat tire delayed us<br />\nmomentarily, but the sunny<br />\nsouthern weather couldn't keep<br />\nus down, and we finally got<br />\nthere--exhausted but alive, and<br />\nready for the Mardi Gras.<br />\nDowntown with the mob<br />\nWe decided to catch our first<br />\nparade, Endymion, with the<br />\nmasses on Canal Street, the heart<br />\nof downtown New Orleans. In<br />\nthe true spirit of the season, the<br />\nparade was far behind schedule.<br />\nThis gave the Philosopher --(an<br />\nancient hometown pal)--and I an<br />\nopportunity to give the Princess<br />\nher first taste of the French<br />\nQuarter, home of Bourbon Street<br />\nand legendary good times.<br />\nIt was early and, although<br />\ncrowded, only the hard core<br />\nderelicts were about, whooping it<br />\nup and guzzling wine. My mind<br />\nhad yet to embrace the revelry<br />\nand was sickened by the rampant<br />\nraunch. The scum of humanity, I<br />\ntold myself. Idle music cascaded<br />\ninto the street from all<br />\ndirections. I kicked the garbage<br />\nand wondered if I would get over<br />\nit. The Princess and the<br />\nPhilosopher were laughing.<br />\nLater, in another section of<br />\nthe business district we bumped<br />\ninto the Ty, a Mardi Gras deity<br />\nof nudity and foolishness. He<br />\nblessed us with the traditional<br />\nembraces, especially for the<br />\nPrincess, and soon made me<br />\nforget I had been so glum. The<br />\nTy told u's of great madness to<br />\ncome and predicted bright<br />\nsunshine for Mardi Gras day. I<br />\nstill suspected rain, though.<br />\nThe parade finally arrived and<br />\nthe Princess learned some basic<br />\nfacts about carnival. Especially in<br />\nthe wilds of downtown, one<br />\n<br />\nquickly understands the guerrilla<br />\nwarfare of Mardi Gras: parades<br />\nhave floats; floats have maskers;<br />\nmaskers are throwing<br />\nbeads, --(\"Pair of beads or string<br />\nof beads?\" the Philosopher asks)<br />\n--trinkets and doubloons; the<br />\ncrowd members will fight<br />\nbrutally to catch, pick up, or<br />\nsteal any of these relatively<br />\nworthless items, especially the<br />\ndoubloons, which are aluminum<br />\ncommemorative coins coming in<br />\nvarious colors. The law<br />\ndowntown is that the intensity of<br />\nthe fight you put up is the most<br />\nimportant thing of all. The clink<br />\nof a doubloon hitting the<br />\npavement will send the crowd<br />\ninto a frenzy.<br />\nI had almost forgotten that<br />\nthis is the year of the<br />\nbicentennial, and was terribly<br />\ndismayed to realize that even<br />\nMardi Gras would be infected.<br />\nThe Krewe of Endymion<br />\nhonored several of our chief<br />\nexecutives. I was heartened by<br />\nthe loud booing from the mob as<br />\na float bearing the head of Nixon<br />\nin a Chinese setting rolled by.<br />\nOur thumbs down, I reflected on<br />\nthe pagan origins of this now<br />\nCatholic holiday and decided<br />\nancient Rome never died.<br />\nThe parade concluded with a<br />\nlocal citizen and I agreeing that<br />\nJerry Ford had proved anybody<br />\ncould be President, as we<br />\nwatched several policemen<br />\nhandcuff and drag away a rather<br />\nviolent couple. The Princess<br />\nreturned from the front of the<br />\ncrowd, ladened with booty. She<br />\ngave me a necklace to wear and<br />\nthe Philosopher gave his<br />\ndoubloons to little children, most<br />\nof whom would sell them to<br />\ntourists.<br />\nUnder the stars, far away from<br />\ndowntown, we drank Dr. Pepper<br />\nin the Philosopher's patio, the<br />\nfountain gurgling in the<br />\nbackground. He told us of an<br />\nacquaintance of his who had<br />\ndecided not to try to catch<br />\nanything this year at the parades,<br />\nbut instead to simply watch. The<br />\nPhilosopher explained to the<br />\nPrincess, \"New Orleans is Mardi<br />\nGras at this time of the year.\" He<br />\nthen dropped a doubloon on the<br />\npatio floor and the Princess and I<br />\njerked ever so slightly at the<br />\nsound.<br />\n<br />\nMusic makes me wanna<br />\nA parade has certain<br />\nwell-defined protocols and each<br />\nkrewe basically ends up with the<br />\nfollowing flexible formula:<br />\nmotorcycles and horses escort<br />\nthe parade; the floats are<br />\npreceded by cars or horses<br />\nbearing the officials of the krewe;<br />\nthe first float usually carries the<br />\nking or queen; the floats are<br />\ninterspersed with bands and<br />\nother marching groups; the police<br />\nare always there.<br />\nThe captain is the most<br />\nimportant person in the<br />\norganization. He is ultimately<br />\nresponsible for everything that<br />\ngoes on. A good captain is a<br />\ndirector-choreographer-father all<br />\nrolled into one magnificent Mardi<br />\nGras costume. The monarch of<br />\nthe krewe -is literally a<br />\nfigurehead.<br />\nMusic is an important part of<br />\nNew Orleans, home of jazz and<br />\nDixieland. This is why I was very<br />\nexcited that bright sunny<br />\nSunday. The Krewe of Mid City<br />\nwould be holding its annual<br />\nparade which always featured<br />\n\"The Greatest Bands in Dixie.\"<br />\nThe Philosopher passed on the<br />\ngood advice of another friend<br />\nthat we watch the parade near<br />\nthe reviewing stand where all the<br />\nbands would play.<br />\nAt the parade site, we met up<br />\nwith our dear friend<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba, a<br />\nmember of that famous New ,<br />\nOrleans family. The Princess and<br />\nMademoiselle became friends at<br />\nonce and ran off to explore the<br />\ncrowds, leaving the Philosopher<br />\nand myself to begin a lengthy<br />\ndiscourse on whether one should<br />\nraise one hand or two when<br />\nyelling, \"Throw me something,<br />\nMister!\" to the passing floats. We<br />\nconcluded that true New<br />\nOrleanians always raised two<br />\narms and yelled their loudest.<br />\nWe were disappointed to learn<br />\nthat due to the bicentennial this<br />\nyear's Mid City parade would<br />\nhave bands from all over the<br />\nUnited States. The show was<br />\nsaved, however, by the.<br />\nhometown boys from Holy Cross'<br />\nHigh School who gave a rousing<br />\nperformance beginning with<br />\n\"Basin Street Blues,\" followed<br />\nsee ZULU, page 7<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 5, 1976/news-letter/page 7.<br />\n<br />\nThe French Quarter, Zulu, and bacchanalia in the streets<br />\nZULU, from page 6<br />\nby a medley of \"The Battle<br />\nHymn of the Republic\" and<br />\n\"Dixie,\" concluding with \"Hold<br />\nThat Tiger,\" both of Holy Cross<br />\nand L.S.U. fame. The spirit of<br />\nthe Mardi Gras was getting to me,<br />\nand I could have sworn I saw the<br />\nPrincess shaking her rear to the<br />\nbeat of the passing marching<br />\nbands.<br />\nAfter the parade, the sun still<br />\nshining through the blue sky, we<br />\nentertained the Princess by<br />\nasking her to spell the name of<br />\nthat New Orlean; street which is<br />\npronounced, C/Z-pi-too-/iis. Our<br />\ndistinguished visitor was unable<br />\nto answer correctly. Can you?<br />\nTake ten seconds<br />\nWRONG! The correct answer is,<br />\n\"-Tchoupitoulas.\"<br />\nThat night we went to see one<br />\nof the youngest, but definitely<br />\none of the better, krewes in New<br />\nOrleans: Bacchus. Crowds for<br />\nthis parade are always as thick as<br />\nMarid Gras day itself. The reason<br />\nis that the floats are bigger and<br />\nmore animated than in any other<br />\nparade. This year, Bacchus<br />\nparaded through the New Orleans<br />\nSuperdome where several<br />\nthousand people had paid to hear<br />\nmusic and become part of a<br />\n\"Mardi Gras party.\"<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba<br />\nexpressed concern that this might<br />\nlead to putting Mardi Gras<br />\ncompletely in the Dome,<br />\ndestroying the greatest free show<br />\non earth. The Philosopher and I<br />\nagreed. Yes, it could even happen<br />\nhere. The thought had brought<br />\nme down, making me believe it<br />\nwould rain on Tuesday, even<br />\nthough Mademoiselle said her<br />\nastrologist had forecast perfect<br />\nweather.<br />\nCalm before the storm<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba had<br />\ntold us, \"There are two reasons<br />\nfor Mardi Gras: greed and<br />\ntackiness.\" Her words echoed<br />\nthrough my mind that perfect<br />\nMonday, walking alone through<br />\nthe French Quarter. Things were<br />\nmore sedate, with the derelicts<br />\nand youths sleeping where they<br />\ncould, the shops open for<br />\nbusiness with the well-dressed<br />\ntourists, and the joints airing<br />\nthemselves out, getting ready for<br />\nmore nighttime madness.<br />\nReligious hustlers swarmed on<br />\nthe Royal Street promenade. A<br />\nyoung girl pinned a carnation on<br />\nme in the name of Hare Krishna.<br />\nOver a fried oyster sandwich, I<br />\nreflected that most people ignore<br />\nthe fact that the Quarter is<br />\nmainly a residential area. Unlike<br />\nthe Block, the French Quarter is<br />\na very beautiful place with<br />\nhouses containing grillwork<br />\nbalconies overlooking high-walled<br />\ncourtyards. This is the original<br />\ncity. Ah, New Orleans, I thought,<br />\nthey call you the city that Care<br />\nforgot. You are such a wonderful<br />\nplace, and yet so sad. Decadence<br />\nis your mistress and life is hearty.<br />\nBut how long can it last? Nothing<br />\nis forever, I reminded myself.<br />\nNot even Mardi Gras, most likely.<br />\nThat touch of melancholy had<br />\ncome to me again.<br />\nThat night we were privileged<br />\nto see the Proteus Parade from a<br />\nbalcony on St. Charles Avenue, a<br />\n<br />\nstreet which begins as skid row<br />\ndowntown and goes to the other<br />\nend of the city, becoming the<br />\nscene for some of the most<br />\nexclusive residences in town. The<br />\nbalcony party was something<br />\nvery dear to me, for nothing<br />\nmakes me happier than the sight<br />\nof New Orleanians eating<br />\ncrawfish and talking while the<br />\nAllman Brothers play in the<br />\nbackground.<br />\nThe Princess earned her key to<br />\nthe city that night by starting a<br />\nparty on a streetcar. It all began<br />\nwhen she asked the other riders<br />\nto sign her transfer. This opened<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\npassing right in front of me, and<br />\nall of a sudden the sun started to<br />\nbreak through and I knew this<br />\nwas going to be my best Mardi<br />\nGras ever.<br />\nZulu is a burlesque of the rest<br />\nof the parades. (But what is a<br />\nburlesque of the burlesque?) The<br />\nfloats have no titles and the<br />\ndoubloons bear no theme, but<br />\ninstead honor an African animal.<br />\nKrewe members do themselves<br />\nup in blackface and dress in garb<br />\nwhich white America has decided<br />\nis the look of the African native.<br />\nBut the best things Zulu has to<br />\noffer are the prized coconuts.<br />\n<br />\ncemetery when he was a young<br />\nboy. Now he lived in Greenwhich<br />\nVillage. He, too, shared my<br />\nfascination with man's most<br />\nunusual enterprise, the cemetery.<br />\nThe symbolism behind the<br />\nstatues used on graves interested<br />\nmy friend a great deal. A<br />\ndespondent figure carrying an<br />\nextinguished torch marked the<br />\ngrave of the head of a household.<br />\nFor a tomb mostly inhabited by<br />\nyoung children, there was a<br />\nweeping angel. Many graves had<br />\nthe figure of a resting lamb. The<br />\npeace of the afterworld, I<br />\nventured.<br />\nBut the cries of the present<br />\nworld made me remember a<br />\npromise I had made to myself to<br />\ngo to the Quarter and see the<br />\ncostume contest. The stranger<br />\nand I parted. What an odd and<br />\nwonderful thing to make a friend<br />\nin a cemetery.<br />\nI will not bother with the<br />\ndetails of how I managed to walk<br />\nsome thirty blocks to my<br />\ndestination. (I am not all that<br />\nsure myself.) But I did reach the<br />\ncorner of Bourbon and Dumaine,<br />\nand there from several angles<br />\nobserved some of the most<br />\nbeautiful and interesting<br />\ncostumes I have ever seen.<br />\nThe annual costume contest is<br />\nsponsored by one of the gay bars<br />\nin the Quarter, and most of the<br />\ncontestants are from that part of<br />\nthe community. I am not about<br />\nto make any stupid<br />\ngeneralizations about gay people<br />\nand good times, but that end of<br />\nthe Quarter always has the best<br />\npartying, and Mardi Gras day lays<br />\nthe ground work for real<br />\nbacchanalia.<br />\nIt starts off with little things<br />\nlike guys in drag as nuns, lifting<br />\ntheir skirts to the eager crowds.<br />\nMany of the contestants are<br />\naccompanied by huge entourages,<br />\nthe group creating a court<br />\nspectacle. These queens really go<br />\nin style, being carried around by<br />\na score of slaves adorned with<br />\nhuge peacock and ostrich<br />\nfeathers, wearing little else. The<br />\nqueens are truly stunning,<br />\nputting most of the real women<br />\n<br />\nThese are truly the treasures of<br />\nMardi Gras because it is virtually<br />\nimpossible to get one. They<br />\nmeant more than any rare<br />\ndoubloon could. I saw crowds<br />\nbeing taunted by those maskers<br />\nholding coconuts inches from<br />\ntheir outstretched hands. Maybe<br />\nI'll get a coconut in the next<br />\n.thirteen years.<br />\nZulu's unplanned turn down<br />\nthe avenue had backed up the<br />\nmany marching clubs which<br />\nprecede Rex, the king of carnival.<br />\nThese groups consist of very<br />\ndrunk members who carry paper<br />\nQueens and dreams<br />\nflowers to be given to females for<br />\nUpon waking up that morning, kisses along the way. Obviously,<br />\nI felt a little smug because the there is some symbolism<br />\ncity was covered by an ugly grey involving deflowering here,<br />\nsky. Masochistically, I envisioned although, like everything else at<br />\ndrenching thunder storms. Why the Mardi Gras, it is bass<br />\nnot, I mused. It would be ackwards. This year there was<br />\neven a female walking<br />\nsomething new for Mardi Gras.<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba had club --Stocking Strutters-arranged for us to base ourselves appropriately giving out garters<br />\nat a luxurious St. Charles instead of flowers.<br />\nresidence. The Princess was<br />\nJubilant from finding Zulu, I<br />\nseeing everything first class.<br />\ncontinued to obey my impulses<br />\nI had promised myself that I and dragged Mademoiselle and<br />\nwould go the Mardi Gras as the Princess to explore a<br />\nmyself, (something I rarely do), cemetery I had passed. On the<br />\nand follow whatever my instincts way there, we met the Ty, on his<br />\ntold me to do. I knew I would be way to flash the mayor. He<br />\nrunning around alot, taking notes sprayed my hair silver, turning<br />\nof all there was to see. (I was me into an old man, and vanished<br />\nbeing a very conscientious in a puff of smoke. Was the early<br />\nreporter.)<br />\nmorning drinking getting to me,<br />\nIn the early hours of the or was it just the Mardi Gras? It's<br />\nmorning, it is fun just to walk only begun, I thought.<br />\naround and look at the costumes<br />\nThe sounds of the approaching<br />\npeople have put together for parade sent Mademoiselle<br />\ncarnival. Couples, especially, use Pontalba and the Princess<br />\na great deal of imagination. I saw running back to the main<br />\nsoldiers, trees, and packs of thoroughfare. I decided to<br />\ncigarettes, Marlboro and Virginia remain in the cemetery,<br />\nSlims.) One couple featured the marveling at the fact that I had<br />\nhelpless male tied up and being seen Zulu which before I had<br />\nonly heard about, and would<br />\ndragged by his mate.<br />\nA very marvelous thing then now hear Rex which I had always<br />\nhappened to me--I bumped into seen. There amidst the graves and<br />\nZulu. Up until recently the only the flowers I sat down and<br />\nt<br />\nblack carnival organization, Zulu wondered who I would be for z<br />\nis considered a piece of magic in Lent.<br />\nI expected to spend that time ;<br />\nsome circles because it never<br />\nfollows any parade route. For the alone, but a stranger appeared<br />\nlast twelve years I had never and before either of us knew it, c\"<br />\nfound Zulu, and had no hope of we were talking like old friends. .2<br />\ndoing so. But there it was, He told me he used to play in the z.<br />\nup friendly relations and the<br />\npassing of wine. As the streetcar<br />\ngrew more crowded, the party<br />\nbecame much louder. The four of<br />\nus had to jump out the window<br />\nwhen we reached our stop. A<br />\nfrustrated lover yelled to<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba to come<br />\nback, as the streetcar pulled<br />\naway.<br />\nIt was only midnight, but<br />\ntomorrow would be a long day.<br />\nWe would need all the sleep we<br />\ncould get and then some.<br />\n<br />\non the street to shame.<br />\nContestants and their groups<br />\ncome in from all sides of the<br />\nstreets, making their way through<br />\nthe thick, sweating crowds. The<br />\nmost memorable entrance I<br />\nobserved was that of a silver god<br />\nemerging from Bourbon Street.<br />\nOn his loin cloth was a set of<br />\nmagnificent stag horns, whin he<br />\nproudly caressed in front of all of<br />\nus, alternating with the eating of<br />\ngrapes, the only thing not silver<br />\nabout him.<br />\nBehind the stage, contestants<br />\nand admirers milled in the hot<br />\nafternoon sun. Debauchery was<br />\nat its finest. A couple proudly<br />\nmade love. Stray hands would<br />\ngrab you now and then. If you<br />\nwere lucky, you would see who it<br />\nwas and grab back.<br />\nUp a block, at the intersection<br />\nof two of the city's most famous<br />\ngay bars, a wild disco was in<br />\nprogress in the street. Bourbon<br />\nPub had its speakers on the<br />\nbalcony. I bumped with the<br />\npartiers below. This was Mardi<br />\nGras.<br />\nHow I ended up on<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba's front<br />\nlawn complaining about a<br />\nheadache, I'll never know.<br />\nOf course, there are a few<br />\nthings I've left out. That night we<br />\nwent back to the french Quarter<br />\nso Mademoiselle and the Princess<br />\ncould get hundreds of Mardi Gras<br />\nkisses from the drunk strangers.<br />\nAn old friend wanted to take the<br />\nPhilosopher mnd I home, but I<br />\ndeclined explaining to him that<br />\nthe Philosopher does not get into<br />\nthat sort of thing, and I would be<br />\nback in the summer. There were<br />\nalso the Jesus people telling us to<br />\nrepent. To me, that was just<br />\nanother costume. And, sure<br />\nenough, we had the reprise of<br />\nanother flat tire on the way<br />\nhome.<br />\nThere is no easy way to talk<br />\nabout Mardi Gras. It is the most<br />\namazing experience in the United<br />\nStates. And if Atropos does not<br />\ncut my thin thread of life short, I<br />\npromise to be back again next<br />\nyear.

Yesterday's rally, along with the petition and<br />\npersonal letters to President Muller, has demonstrated that<br />\nboth students and faculty consider the degree as an affront to<br />\nthe integrity of Johns Hopkins University.

Perhaps<br />\nher highness was not the best<br />\nchoice. I believe that these, and<br />\nother questions pertaining to the<br />\nunderlying circumstances remain<br />\nto be seen. The shocking fact<br />\nremains that the Hopkins<br />\nintelligensia were so naively<br />\nimpressed by the lies, and<br />\nexremist views of the Iranian<br />\nStudents' Association. The I.S.A.<br />\nis merely a group of frustrated,<br />\ninfantile, and mentally unstable<br />\nmarxists who do not have the<br />\ndignity, or the courage of voicing<br />\ntheir criticisms in their own land.<br />\nSuch people as Mike<br />\nHoffheimer attribute their<br />\nactivities to the fact that the<br />\ngranting of the degree was \"an<br />\ninsult to thP Iranian People\". I<br />\nsincerely refuse to believe that<br />\nthe Iranian People would desire<br />\nthe representation of Mr.<br />\nHoffheimer, and the members of<br />\nthe I.S.A. Have any of the people<br />\n\\ to associate the granting 01 tne<br />\n<br />\ndegree with \"a disgrace to<br />\nHopkins\" stopped to think about<br />\ntheir own actions? I fail to see<br />\nthe difference between that<br />\n''possible\" disgrace, and the<br />\n\"certain\" ignomony brought<br />\nupon the university by the<br />\nsupport given to a revolutionary<br />\ngroup such as the Iranian<br />\nStudents' Association.<br />\nFarid Gharagozloo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI thoroughly enjoyed your<br />\nsatirical representation of the<br />\nelitist attitude that pervades the<br />\nvery tennis magazines of<br />\nvenerable St. Elmo Hall.<br />\nOf course, the article on Delta<br />\nPhi wasn't the masterful satire it<br />\ncame across to be, but it most<br />\nassuredly could have been. The<br />\nauthor asserts Delta Phi members<br />\nhappen to be \"a tad more<br />\naffluent and conservatice\", but<br />\napparently never asks himself<br />\nwhy Delta Phiers possess that<br />\nextra tad. The answer to that<br />\nquestion is obvious.<br />\nNot only was the author's<br />\nsnobbery worthy of Delta Phi,<br />\nbut his comments that follow<br />\ninforms me of the present state<br />\nof American racism: \"The band<br />\n(at fraternity Y) sounded as if<br />\ntheir last gig was at the Kit Kat<br />\nKlub on Pulaslcy Highway.. .<br />\nWalking into X (after talking to<br />\nan Arab friend outside; X attracts<br />\nall kinds)...\"<br />\nPaw Penniman<br />\n<br />\nFaculty letter protests the degree<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe the undersigned members<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins faculty,<br />\nwish to protest and publicly<br />\ndisassociate ourselves from the<br />\nawarding of an honorary degree to<br />\nPrincess Ashraf Pahlavi, the sister<br />\nof the Shah of Iran. We would<br />\nlike to explain our reasons.<br />\nThe Shah of Iran is a ruthless<br />\ndictator with no respect<br />\nwhatsoever for human rights or<br />\ncivil liberties. The widespread use<br />\nof torture by the Iranian secret<br />\npolice, both in Iran and abroad,<br />\nis a matter of international<br />\nscandal. Amnesty International<br />\nand the International Federation<br />\nof Human Rights report more<br />\nthan 100,000 political prisoners<br />\nin Iran at the present time and<br />\nsome 300 official executions in<br />\nthe last three years, while Ivan<br />\nMorris, Chairman of the Board of<br />\nAmnesty International, has<br />\nstated that, \"Iran has the worst<br />\nrecord of political repression in<br />\nthe world.\" (New York Times,<br />\nFebruary 29, 1976).<br />\nWhile it would be unfortunate<br />\nwere we to visit the sins of all<br />\nbrothers on their sisters, we note<br />\nin this case that the Shah's<br />\nimmediate family constitutes the<br />\ncore of the power structure in<br />\nIran and that Princess Ashraf is<br />\n<br />\nvery active in State affairs. We<br />\nconsider the award of an<br />\nhonorary degree to her as an act<br />\nwhich directly condones the<br />\nwidespread disregard for civil and<br />\nhuman rights in Iran. Statements<br />\nby the President and Provost of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins to the effect<br />\nthat the award in no way<br />\namounts to an endorsement of<br />\nthe Shah's regime and that it is<br />\n\"not the University's role to<br />\njudge\" in these matters, are<br />\nentenable. The award of this<br />\ndegree has the effect of using the<br />\nreputation and prestige of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to<br />\nlegitimize and bolster a repressive<br />\nregime. It puts the University<br />\nfirmly on the side of barbarism,<br />\ntorture and repression and<br />\nagainst human rights and civil<br />\nliberties.<br />\nIn our view, the only<br />\nhonorable course for the<br />\nUniversity in this situation is (1)<br />\nto provide a full explanation of<br />\nthe circumstances surrounding<br />\nthe award, (2) to drop the<br />\ncharges against those who<br />\nprotested at the ceremony,(3) to<br />\nrescind the degree, and (4) to use<br />\nits influence to secure the release<br />\nof the political prisoners in Iran<br />\nknown to Amnesty International.<br />\nsincerely yours,<br />\n<br />\nDOG EE<br />\nDOG EE<br />\nDOG EE<br />\nPoliti, al<br />\nScierice<br />\nBiophy:3iCs<br />\nMichael Beer<br />\nChemistry<br />\nJohn Gryder<br />\nChristopher Chase-Bunn<br />\nSoc ial<br />\nRelatic<br />\nRicky Rubinson Social Relatic<br />\nElias Rivers Romance Langualges<br />\nSamuelWeber Humanities Center<br />\nHenry SussmanHumanities Ceriter<br />\nJerry CooperNear Eastern Stuclies<br />\nFrancis Rourke Political Scierice<br />\nNancy Hartsock Political Scierice<br />\nLawrence Holland<br />\nEnglish<br />\nRichard Cone<br />\nBiophys.ics<br />\nSidney Mintz<br />\nAnthropolc)gy<br />\nBeatriz: Lavandera Anthropolc)gy<br />\nJack Elzinga<br />\nMath Scien,ces<br />\nWalter Michaels<br />\nEngl.ish<br />\nAlicia Borinsky<br />\nRomaiIce<br />\nLangu iges<br />\nAnthropologY<br />\nJean C op an s<br />\nBiol,ogY<br />\nEric Weinberg<br />\nRenate Horlemann<br />\nHumanities<br />\nCen[ter<br />\nRomarice<br />\nJeffrey Mehlmary<br />\nLangua ges<br />\nJean Paris Romance Languiiges<br />\nWarner Love<br />\nBiophysics<br />\nWilliam Sofer<br />\nBiologY<br />\nPhilip Hartman<br />\nBiologY<br />\nVincent Pigiet<br />\nBiologY<br />\nFrancis Carlson<br />\nBiophysics<br />\nDavid Harvey<br />\nCharles Chamberlin<br />\nJohn Boland<br />\nRic Pfeffer<br />\n<br />\nAnd Muller stands firm .<br />\nImperial Organization of Social<br />\nServices in Iran and the Reza<br />\nPahlavi Medical Center in Tehran,<br />\nwith whose College of Health<br />\nSciences we are collaborating in<br />\nthe training of health care<br />\npersonnel to serve the rural<br />\npopulation of Iran.

When the recognized<br />\nlandmarks and bellwethers of our<br />\nday crumble into obscurity, the<br />\nbottle will remain, refuge of all<br />\npeoples. The bottle is more than<br />\njust a magnificently contorted<br />\npiece of glass, it is history itself,<br />\nsymbol of many a good man's<br />\nlife.<br />\nBut then bottles have always<br />\nbeen important to me. Bottled<br />\nmemories burst from my brain,<br />\nshifting in mood from the black<br />\nto euphoric. I remember the milk<br />\nbottle that was hurled at my<br />\nUncle Ernie's saddle brown<br />\nVolvo during a riot in East<br />\nDetroit back in '65. The bottle<br />\nb roke through the windshield<br />\n.and whizzed across my head,<br />\nleaving a gash which is now a<br />\nflashy Detroit scar. Some may<br />\nsay the world is a ghet-to, but<br />\nme, well, I say the world is a<br />\nbottle.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nA classic rememberance is the<br />\nsmall container of Romilar cough<br />\nmedicine in the bathroom closet,<br />\na bottle whose label is streaked<br />\nwith the aged maroon syrup that<br />\nanyone in his right mind cringes<br />\nat. No, bottles aren't always fun<br />\nwhen you're not of age.<br />\nMy first great bottle<br />\nexperience came when I was<br />\nthirteen, while romping aloug the<br />\nshores of Lake Ontario. I was<br />\nkicking up some sand when I<br />\nfound a boat in a bottle, carrying<br />\na note which read: \"They tried<br />\nto anchor me in Boston. Tried to<br />\ncram that damn piety from my<br />\ntoes to my scalp. But I'm gone<br />\nforever, they ain't gonna find me.<br />\nAn' I'm so happy I gotta let it<br />\nout. So I send this boat in a<br />\nbottle, with regards to all who<br />\nfind it. You should always keep a<br />\nbottle by your side, a bottle to<br />\ngo, a bottle to throw, 'cause a<br />\nbottle will keep you aglow!<br />\nSigned Cameron Quincy, Port<br />\nJefferson, N.Y., October 13,<br />\n1912.\"<br />\nI took this sailor's advice and<br />\nwatched my bottle memories<br />\nclimb. Like the time I snitched<br />\n<br />\ntwo bottles of champagne at<br />\nAunt Connie's wedding, way<br />\nbefore my stomach had grown<br />\nup. Or the bottles of dollar apple<br />\nwine that we all passed around<br />\nwhile out on a cruise. And need I<br />\nmention the piles of beer bottles<br />\nthat have been tossed in bars and<br />\nbackyards, Buicics, and ballparks?<br />\nStill, the bottle's future is<br />\nbleak. Flip top cans (crush,<br />\n<br />\ncrunch, and zip, into the garbage)<br />\nhave stolen the thunder. It seems<br />\nthat antiquated Coke and<br />\nSeven-up bottles are found only<br />\nin tiny Midwestern and Southern<br />\ntowns, locked up in soda<br />\nmachines that demand just<br />\nfifteen cents. The age of the<br />\nbottle is clearly in danger.<br />\nChampions of the bottle like<br />\nmyself are hard<br />\nput to defend<br />\n<br />\nour eccentricity. It's not easy to<br />\npour out my feelings this way<br />\nwithout undue sentiment, but<br />\nthe person who appreciates the<br />\nbottle today is so rare.And let us<br />\nremember that some beach was<br />\ndeprived of countless grains of<br />\nsand so that you may marvel at<br />\nthe bottle between your teeth.<br />\nI think the least we can do is<br />\ndrink to it.<br />\n<br />\nJust who says the Student Council hasn't worked together?<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\n\"WHO SAYS THE STUDENT<br />\nCOUNCIL HASN'T WORKED<br />\nTOGETHER?\" Appropriately<br />\nenough, the Student Council<br />\nmembers themselves did\u2014which<br />\nmakes it difficult to understand<br />\nwhy they responded at all to<br />\ntheir own criticism, much less<br />\nwith the huge, bloated broadside<br />\nthat appeared in this paper last<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nIt seems unbecoming of an<br />\nelected body that purports to<br />\nhold \"the undergraduates best<br />\ninterest\" at heart to wave a list of<br />\n\"accomplishments\" in the faces<br />\nof its constituents like some<br />\ndesperate job applicant<br />\nbrandishing a portfolio, and<br />\nalmost obscene for it to devote<br />\n$125, the cost of that full-page<br />\nself-congratulation, towards that<br />\nend.<br />\nBut aside from the<br />\ntransparency of this pre-election<br />\ntime ploy, and this flagrant<br />\nmisuse of the SC exchequer,<br />\nthere is a more basic wrong\u2014the<br />\nfoistering of an outrageous<br />\ndeceit.

SRYGLEY<br />\nI reached the perimeter of<br />\nParis at one a.m., with no hope<br />\nof finding a place to stay. My car<br />\nAmstraat and I spent the night in<br />\na well-lit rest area, where I laid<br />\non my back across the<br />\nnone-too-large front seat, my feet<br />\nstuck out the open window.<br />\nAmstraat, I suppose, enjoyed the<br />\nrest.<br />\nI woke at seven, stretched<br />\nguardedly, found two<br />\nuncommonly painful cricks in<br />\nmy neck and back, and drove on<br />\ninto the traffic jam which had<br />\nsprung up in anticipation of my<br />\narrival near the Charles de<br />\nGaulle airporti. This unexpected<br />\npleasure, the French<br />\nembouteillage, did nothing to<br />\nundo the knots the brain was<br />\ntying in my poor, strained<br />\nmuscles, but I am still glad that I<br />\nhad the chance to endure it, for<br />\nit gave me my first insight into<br />\nthe at once delicate and<br />\naggressive character of the<br />\nnatives. Anything which I learned<br />\nabout the Parisian character after<br />\nthat morning only added tepid<br />\nbrowns and greens to the first<br />\nhot splashes of red and orange<br />\nwith which I first, and correctly,<br />\ncanvassed them. The beguiling<br />\ninhabitants of Paris have acquired<br />\na lengthy list of cultural<br />\nattributes since the disappearance<br />\nof their hairy ancestors, the<br />\nParisii tribe, from the Isle in the<br />\ncenter of the Seine; stuffy<br />\nmannerisms, an introspective<br />\nsophistication, and the Mona<br />\nLisa, to name a few, but at heart,<br />\nand deep in his guts, the average<br />\nParisian has a secret wish to be<br />\nNapolean IV, worldconquerer. I<br />\nsuppose it was the unsuspected<br />\neruption of the Maginot Line<br />\nwhich caused the psychological<br />\ntrauma which, made today's<br />\nParisian the confused<br />\nschizophrenic that he is. I will<br />\nnever forget the hostile sarcastic<br />\nroar of the low lying Citroen,<br />\nnever forget the maniacal laugh<br />\nof each bellicose driver as one<br />\nafter another they strove for the<br />\npetite space which Amstraat and<br />\nI occupied so innocently, so<br />\nharmlessly. What severity! What<br />\nintimidation! First the barrage,<br />\nthen the blitzkrieg, they lunged,<br />\nwe dodged, Amstraat hid herself<br />\nbetween two cement trucks, but<br />\nnever an end to the fierce<br />\nonslaught. Vaarrroom! And then,<br />\njust when I thought it was certain<br />\ndestruction or over the guard-rail,<br />\nAmstraat showed me what a<br />\nSpartan she could be. Attack? We<br />\ndared, we ran the gauntlet in<br />\n<br />\ndefiance at close quarters;<br />\nimmediately our harsh assailants<br />\nwere thrown into confusion.<br />\nAmstraat had finally cleared her<br />\nthroat, and I had come with new<br />\nand unforseen tactics, for once,<br />\nlong ago, I had vied with the very<br />\nbest in the toughest arena in the<br />\nworld: New York, they will<br />\nalways sing your praise...<br />\nFinally, Amstraat, I, and our<br />\nbreathless pursuers came to the<br />\ngreat belt which circumscribes<br />\nParis. A great sign figured the<br />\nchoice I could not make: Paris<br />\nL'Ouest? Paris L'Est? Purely by<br />\ncoincidence it was another grey<br />\nVolkswagen which forced us<br />\nfrom our indecision, and we<br />\nturned West, which, incidentally,<br />\nturned out to be the wrong way.<br />\nKilometers later, Amstraat and I<br />\nentered the great confusion of<br />\nasphalt, cobblestones, and<br />\ncroissants which is Paris. It was,<br />\nbelieve me, no cure for my latent<br />\nromanticism that we entered that<br />\ngreat .city somewhere between<br />\nChaillot and Montmartre, in the<br />\nspiritual shadow- of the Sacre<br />\nCour.<br />\nThe casual American reader<br />\nwho has never been to Paris<br />\ncannot understand the stress and<br />\nstamina which is required of<br />\nevery Parisian driver without<br />\nstretching the imagination: Death<br />\nlurks in spots seen and unforseen.<br />\nParis has the absolute minimum<br />\nof the necessary traffic signals,<br />\nand an amazing lack of careful,<br />\nthoughtful drivers. Amstraat and<br />\nI circumvented destruction only<br />\nby sheer luck, and never allowed<br />\nourselves an easy moment until<br />\nwe were parked in virtual asylum<br />\nbeneath the Eiffel Tower.<br />\nHow did it happen that we<br />\nmanaged to make our way across<br />\nParis without even a map? I<br />\nremmembered a patent<br />\nexpression which had long agc<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY, March 6, 8 PM<br />\nKUMSITZ<br />\nFisher Lounge?<br />\nAdmission $1.00<br />\nGuitarist<br />\n<br />\nbeen tucked away in the archives<br />\nof my mind? a who is it, what is<br />\nit, where is it expression which<br />\nbecame my key to the French<br />\nworld:<br />\n\"Pourriez-vous m'indiquer...\"<br />\nI had already been to the top<br />\nof the Tour d'Eiffel many times<br />\nbefore in daydreams; I had even<br />\nbeen thrown off it by a man in a<br />\ngorilla suit in the nightmares of<br />\nmy eight-year-old mind, though<br />\nat that time I did not hit the<br />\nground because I had no idea<br />\nwhat the terrain below would be<br />\nlike: when there are no visuals,<br />\nthere are no dreams.<br />\nIt was nine o'clock; the tower<br />\nwould open at ten. I looked<br />\n<br />\nforward to the elevator ascension<br />\nwith a mixture of excitement and<br />\nthe anticipation of<br />\ndisappointment. Could it<br />\npossibly be as good as I had<br />\ndreamed it to be? I contented<br />\nmyself with a leisurely stroll<br />\naround the trim park beneath,<br />\nwhere I found myself<br />\nexceptionally pleased with its<br />\nsymmetries: every tree, every<br />\nbench, every side path had its<br />\nidentical counterpart just<br />\nopposite. Is it so strange then<br />\nthat for every step I took I<br />\nimagined another step of the<br />\nsame distance, the same weight,<br />\nthe same sound on the twin path,<br />\na step placed perhaps by another<br />\nsix-foot, bearded, blue- eyed<br />\nstudent of nineteen years like<br />\nme? The grass between us was a<br />\nsoft green\u2014surely I would have<br />\nenjoyed my early fall from the<br />\ntower if I had guessed it was into<br />\nso soft a bed. At the end of the<br />\npark, the far end from Eiffel's<br />\nfour-sided, steel, symmetrical A,<br />\nI disappeared into a small store<br />\nand reappeared a moment later<br />\nwith my breakfast of oranges,<br />\nmilk, bread, and cheese\u2014my<br />\nstaple diet for then and ever<br />\nafter.

At the same time I was beset<br />\nby a number of trifling but<br />\ndisturbing questions. Why was<br />\nthe Eiffel Tower ever built'? For<br />\nconstruction's sake? As a<br />\nmonument to the flourishing<br />\nsteel girder? Perhaps a new art<br />\nform?

The<br />\nenvious Nazis might have<br />\ndestroyed it, but they could not<br />\nbecause it was greater than they:<br />\nThey were forced to ignore it. If<br />\nonly a Brecht, a Munster, or an<br />\nOpenhausser had designed it\u2014if<br />\nonly it stood in symbolic grace,<br />\nphonetic character of grief, the<br />\nfour-sided A\u2014as a symbol of the<br />\ndivine Arian race! But it did not,<br />\nand, as any visitor can see, for<br />\nhimself, the Tower was never<br />\nmoved to Munich. Freud, the<br />\ninimitable symbolist, must have<br />\ncast a wary eye on Eiffel's work<br />\nseeing it, perhaps, as the revealing<br />\nproduct of that same society<br />\nwhich gave us the French Kiss,<br />\nbut, I ask you, do the ladies<br />\nblush at the sight of it? Only A<br />\nwould be able to appreciate it on<br />\nthat score, only A would fall<br />\nhappily into the green bed below<br />\nin worship, only A would climb<br />\njoyously to its height, grip the<br />\nsteel rail in either hand, and fling<br />\nherself, forever happy, to the<br />\neternal and genuine supplication<br />\nwhich would obliterate her form<br />\nat its base.

The<br />\nJays had lost two All-American<br />\ndefensemen; Mike Siegert and<br />\nBob Barbera to graduation,<br />\nleaving Dennis Gagomiros as the<br />\nkey returnee.<br />\nThen, just prior to the season<br />\nopener with Virginia, Gaga<br />\nwrecked a knee, rendering him<br />\nuseless until the post-season All<br />\nStar game.<br />\nEntering this season, head<br />\ncoach Henry Ciccarone cited two<br />\nmain areas of weakness in the<br />\nBlue Jay ten. The most<br />\n<br />\nimportant was lack of depth at<br />\nmidfield.<br />\nSo, following the script<br />\nperfectly, Don Aimmerman<br />\nHopkins' highest scoring middie,<br />\nin practice last week, tore<br />\ncartilage in his knee. It is<br />\ncurrently in a cast to immobilize<br />\nit and next week the cast will be<br />\nremoved and the verdict will be<br />\nrendered.<br />\nThe question is not to cut or<br />\nnot to cut, but rather, to cut:<br />\nnow or later?<br />\nSuch an injury definitely<br />\nrequires an operation but the<br />\npossibility exists that via medical<br />\nwonders such as cortisone and<br />\ntape, Zimm may be able to play<br />\nout the season.<br />\nIf playing under such<br />\nconditions is impossible, then the<br />\noperation will be immediate thus<br />\nallowing him to play at the end<br />\nof the season.<br />\nAll of this appears even more<br />\nunfortunate when viewed in the<br />\nlight of what the St. Paul's school<br />\ngraduate had overcome.<br />\nAfter transferring to Hopkins,<br />\nZimmerman had to have knee<br />\nsurgery on the same knee prior to<br />\nlast season for removal of<br />\ncartilage. He had obviously, by<br />\n<br />\nhis play last year, completely<br />\nrecovered from that injury, only<br />\nto be struck again this year.<br />\nThis further complicates an<br />\nalready unsettled situation in the<br />\nmidfield.<br />\nLack of depth is a problem<br />\nwhich can be overcome against<br />\nsome teams the Jays play because<br />\nof sheer talent. However, against<br />\nequally talent-rich opponents like<br />\nMaryland and Cornell, that sore<br />\nspot could be fatal.<br />\nThree freshmen have been<br />\nattempting to prevent that and<br />\nlooking mighty good in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\nBob Teasdall, Steve Wey and<br />\nDave Huntley have come along<br />\nsurprisingly well in such a short<br />\ntime. Of the three, the biggest<br />\nsurprise has probably been<br />\nHuntley. Not because of any lack<br />\nof talent, but rather 14ecause of<br />\nthe difficult transition which the<br />\nCanadian had to make from box<br />\nlacrosse to field lacrosse.

Last<br />\nyear, due to the paucity of<br />\navailable senior players, Kohler<br />\nand Kevin Mahon were picked<br />\nbut this year Mahon (only a<br />\njunior) passed the opportunity<br />\non to the upperclassmen.<br />\nBoth local products, Kohler<br />\nplayed his high school ball at<br />\nCalvert Hall; Moorhead at<br />\nTowson. \"Head\" then started his<br />\ncollegiate career at the University<br />\nof Virginia, transferring to<br />\nHopkins after one semester.<br />\nKohler was selected to the first<br />\nAll-American team's midfield<br />\nwhile Moorhead was named to<br />\nthe second team's defense.<br />\n\"The main role that we expect<br />\nthe captains to play is one of<br />\ncommunication,\" according to<br />\n<br />\nhead coach Henry .Ciccarone.<br />\n\"They should act as a go-between<br />\namongst the players and the<br />\ncoaches.

She took her shoes off and<br />\nwalked on, marveling at the feel of the<br />\ncushion below her tiring feet. She walked<br />\nin much more comfort now and it was<br />\nnot long before she saw a break in the<br />\ntrees\u2014Another trail. She put her shoes<br />\non and went up to the edge, where she<br />\nsaw two men laying railroad track down<br />\nthe center of the footway.<br />\n\"Pardon me,\" she excused herself,<br />\n\"but could either of you tell me which<br />\ntrail I've stumbled onto?\"<br />\n\"Ah'll handle this 'tin,\" the big worker<br />\ntole the other man. He turned to face her<br />\nand Alice found herself confronted by a<br />\ncorpulent walrus. \"Well, I think this<br />\n'un'll be psychology, now. Why?\"<br />\n\"I just wanted to know. I seem to be<br />\nlost.\"<br />\n\"Lost in Homewoodland? Tch. Tch.\"<br />\nAlice's attention was diverted by the<br />\ntrack.\"What are you doing?\"<br />\n\"Why, I'm layin' track. Ain't that<br />\nplain enough?\"<br />\n\"Yes. Yes, it is. Buy why?\"<br />\n\"The Queen wants ta speed up the<br />\nfolks on the paths.\"<br />\n\"But you'll need trains and engineers.<br />\nWhat for?\"<br />\n\"We'll need trains,\" he corrected her,<br />\nignoring the pertinent question.<br />\n<br />\n\"No engineers?\"<br />\n\"Nope. You don't need no engineer if<br />\nthe track don't have no switchpoints,<br />\nnow do ya?\"<br />\n\"Well, yes, I should think you would.<br />\nWhat if...\"<br />\n\"Bah!\" the Walrus snorted. He turned<br />\nto the track and told the man how to do<br />\nthe work.\"Bullshit.\"<br />\nAlice decided that it was an opportune<br />\ntime to resume her journey and so<br />\nquietly slipped back through the<br />\nunderbrush.<br />\nAs dusk was settling, Alice was still in<br />\nthe thick of the forest. Fear was<br />\ngrappling up her backbone, making dull<br />\nthuds as it climbed up each disc. Her<br />\neyes shifted nervously in anticipation of<br />\nodd creatures. \"Oh dear. I hope I find a<br />\nfootpath before dark,\" she said to the<br />\nforest.<br />\n\"Which path would that be?\" a voice<br />\ncalled out.<br />\n\"Huh? Pardon me?\" Alice looked<br />\nabout, saw nothing.<br />\n\"Up here,\" the voice explained.<br />\nAlice looked up to_find a plump pink<br />\ncat lying lazily on the branches, of the<br />\nevergreen above. \"Oh, hello.\"<br />\n\"Hello,\" said the cat, and stared<br />\nsilently.<br />\nAlice regarded him more closely. He<br />\nwas not really so much like a cat as a<br />\nsilly quffed representation of one. He<br />\nhad lavender stripes across the length of<br />\nhis back and a toothy grin that showed<br />\nthree times as much sparkling human<br />\ndentition than a cat's mouth has any<br />\nright to do.\"Who are you?\"<br />\n\"That is the caterpillar's question,<br />\nbuffoon. Anyway, I am the Cheshire<br />\n<br />\nCat.\"<br />\n\"Well, Cheshire hiss,\" she boldly<br />\nendeared him, \"could you tell me which<br />\nway one ought to walk to reach a path?\"<br />\n\"That would surely depend on where<br />\none wishes to be going.\"<br />\n\"But I'm afraid I'm not quite certain<br />\nyet where I want to be.\"<br />\n\"Want it or not, you are quite<br />\ncertainly where you are.\"<br />\n,`But I hope to get somewhere.<br />\nPerhaps you could help me decide,\" she<br />\nprompted.<br />\n\"I don't think I could do that. You<br />\nsee, I wouldn't care.\"<br />\n\"I can understand that, but I do care.\"<br />\n\"Well,\" grinned the Cat, \"what would<br />\nyou like to be doing for the rest of your<br />\nlife?\"<br />\n\"1...well I'm afraid I just don't know.\"Then take any path or paths you<br />\nplease. It makes no difference.\"<br />\nAlice noticed at this point that the<br />\nstripes of the Cat were unwinding. She<br />\nstared in wonder as the lavender stripes<br />\nvanished silently. \"It makes no<br />\ndifference?\"<br />\n\"No,\" said the Cat who was now just a<br />\nfading head.<br />\n\"But why not?\" she gulped.<br />\n\"Because you won't get a job when<br />\nyou get out of here anyway, the smiling<br />\nteeth answered. This was all that was left<br />\nof the Cheshire Cat, and it too dissipated<br />\ninto a soft glow, faded into the night.<br />\n\"Oh dear,\" Alice whispered. She<br />\ndecided to stay in the forest until<br />\nmorning, for it was now too dark to find<br />\none's way in the woods. With a pad of<br />\nmoss for a pillow, she soon fell into a<br />\ndeep, dreamless sleep.<br />\n<br />\n(-)<br />\n<br />\n\u2014\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCD<br />\n<br />\nCD<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "But charges stand<br /><br />\nmarch 5, 1976/news-letter/page 1<br /><br />\nRally brings loud cries of protest to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br /><br />\nProfessor David Harvey speaks at rally<br /><br />\ndavid porter<br /><br />\nand<br />\nRUSS SMITH<br />\nOver three hundred people gathered in front<br />\nof Levering Hall at noon yesterday in protest of<br />\nthe University's conferral of an honorary degree<br />\non the Princess Ashraf Pahlavi of Iran.<br />\nSpeakers at the hour-long rally urged the<br />\nUniversity to formally apologize for awarding<br />\nthe degree and to drop all charges filed against<br />\nthe five protesters arrested at the Cenntenial<br />\nConvocation at the Lyric Theater February 22.<br />\nThe demonstration was part of a concerted<br />\neffort by Hopkins students and faculty to<br />\nconvince the administration to officially reverse<br />\nits position on the doctorate award and to<br />\naccount for its actions. The ad hoc group had<br />\ncollected about 1200 signatures from the<br />\nHopkins community on a petition towards that<br />\nend.<br />\nPresident Muller stated yesterday afternoon,<br />\nhowever, that the University would not reverse<br />\nIts stance and can do nothing about the charges<br />\nPending against those arrested at the Lyric.<br />\n\"The University is not prosecuting anybody;<br />\nit's in the hands of the state's attorney,\" Muller<br />\nsaid. \"I don't think there is anything I can<br />\nresponsibly do,\" he added.<br />\nAlthough Muller has not called a public<br />\nmeeting to respond to the widespread criticism<br />\nof the award, he is scheduled to speak in the<br />\nDorm social lounge on Monday night. \"Anything<br />\nbeyond that, I doubt; people have seen the<br />\nfaculty letter and .my statement,\" he asserted.<br />\nThe rally featured seven speakers, including<br />\ntwo people from the Iranian Student<br />\nAssociation. All ISA members wore masks for<br />\nfear of reprisal against their families in Iran.<br />\nAfter speeches by an ISA representative and<br />\nUniversity Chaplain Chester Wickwire, Professor<br />\nDavid Harvey questioned Muller's claim \"that he<br />\nhas no control\" over the charges. \"This is<br />\nerroneous\" he said. \"He can use his influence,<br />\nnot his authority. There's no question that the<br />\ncharges would then be dropped.\"<br />\nHarvey read the text of a letter signed by<br />\nthirty faculty members, which read, in part,<br />\n\"We, the undersigned members of The Johns<br />\nHopkins faculty, wish to protest and publicly<br /><br />\ndisassociate ourselves from the awarding of an<br />\nhonorary degree to Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, the<br />\nsister of the Shah of Iran.\" ( for the full text of<br />\nthe letter sec pg. 8)<br />\n\"If the award stands,\" Harvey continued,\"the<br />\nUniversity should issue a public statement that it<br />\ndoes not condone the policies of Iran.\" Although<br />\nMuller sent a personal reply to the faculty letter,<br />\nHarvey maintained that a general apology was<br />\nnecessary as well. Harvey went on to discuss the<br />\ngeneral position of the University, asserting that<br />\nit \"should not cave in to the pressures of those<br />\nwith power, privilege and fortune; rather,<br />\nconstantly struttle against these influences and<br />\ntry to assert its independence.\"<br />\nFinale<br />\nThe final speaker was Mike Hoffheimer, a<br />\nHopkins student who was arrested at the<br />\nConvocation. \"The question is not how the<br />\nchoice was made,\" he said, \"but that it was<br />\nmade. The real criminal is Ashraf, and the<br />\nadministration is complicitly approving her by<br />\ngranting the degree.\"<br />\nThe rally, however successful it was, has thus<br />\nfar done little to alter the Universit)4s policies<br />\nregarding the award. \"I didn't think we were<br />\nmaking a political statement,\" Muller<br />\ncommented. \"I did not and still do not regard<br />\nthe degree as an endorsement of Iran's policies.\"<br />\nWhen the honorary degree was proposed last<br />\nfall, Muller said that he did not think it would be<br />\nthat cmtroversial\u2022 However, he was not surprised<br />\nat the size of the rally and the number of<br />\npetition signatures. He acknowledged the<br />\nawareness of the community, but added that<br />\n\"compared to some of the things I've seen, this<br />\nwas a very orderly affair.\"<br />\nWhen asked if he made an error, Muller<br />\nreplied: \"It was my belief that we could<br />\nappropriately recognize the significant effort by<br />\nthe College of Health Sciences\u2014the effort in<br />\nwhich we are participating in\u2014to improve<br />\nmedical care for a badly neglected rural<br />\npopulation by awarding the degree to the titular<br />\nhead of all this in Iran, without taking a position<br />\non other<br />\n_ aspects of the government of Iran or its<br />\npolicies. This was a mistake on my part.\"<br />\nIn response to allegations that the degree was<br />\ngiven in hopes of Iranian grants to the<br />\nUniversity, Muller stated, \"there was no quid pro<br />\nquo.\" As for further University actions on the<br /><br />\nissue, Muller 'said, \"I don't really know what else<br />\ncan or will happen.\"<br />\nMark Hertsgaard, a spokesman for the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee, did not see the rally as a last step in<br />\nlight of the University's refusal to meet the<br />\ndemands of the petitions and letters. \"This<br />\nindicated a real disdain for the viewpoint<br />\nexpressed by the 1200 signatures; it's really<br />\ncontemptuous to not entertain an obviously<br />\nmajority opinion of the campus. Because of this<br />\ndisdain, members of the Hopkins Community<br />\nshould be appalled that the University is just not<br />\ntaking it seriously.\"<br />\nHertsgaard, who was \"ecstatic\" about the<br />\nsuccess of the rally and petitions, said that \"the<br />\nHopkins community clearly demonstrated their<br />\nfeelings on this issue. The University has to<br />\naccount for their actions, and should think<br />\nseriously about meeting the demands.\" After<br />\npresenting Muller with the petition, though, he<br />\nwas angered that the University \"did not<br />\nconfront the demands at all; they basically<br />\nignored us.\"<br /><br />\nISA representative speaks at rally<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/march 5, 1976<br /><br />\nChesapeake Women's Rugby Club<br />\nbegins active practices this Sunday,<br />\nMarch 7 at 10 a.m. on their home<br />\nfield.

CONSIDINE<br />\nEnter any record shop these<br />\ndays, and as you approach the<br />\ncash register to put yourself into<br />\nvinyl hock, you will notice<br />\nseveral magazines. Generally they<br />\nwill consist of Rolling Stone and<br />\nThe National Lampoon, with<br />\noccasional cameos by<br />\nCreern,Crawdaddy, Downbeat,<br />\nDifferent Drummer, Guitar<br />\nPlayer, Hi Fidelity,<br />\nGrammophone, Melody Maker,<br />\nand the ever popular Schwan,'<br />\nCatalog.<br />\nWell, what good are they? To<br />\nfind out, this courageous reporter<br />\nwaded through pages upon pages<br />\nof tabloid, photo spreads, and ad<br />\nCopy. What did he find? Not a<br />\nhell of alot.<br />\nJust in the interest of space,<br />\nthese remarks will be narrowed<br />\ndown to Crawdaddy, Creem,<br />\nDownbeat and Rolling Stone;<br />\nessentially \"rock\" magazines. But<br />\nthere's more than meets the .eye<br />\nin the term \"rock\" magazine.<br />\nTake for example, Creem.<br />\nCreem is \"America's Only<br />\nRock'n'Roll Magazine\" (it says<br />\nso on the cover). Creem is also<br />\nthe music world's News<br />\nAmerican. A genuine junk format<br />\ncomplemented by layout which<br />\nappears to be the work of<br />\nfour-year-olds, Crean has all the<br />\ntaste and elegance of Kiss in<br />\nconcert with the New York<br />\nDolls.<br />\nEssentially, Creem is the sort<br />\nof magazine one expects to find<br />\nin every Junior High School rest<br />\nroom. There are such features as<br />\n\"Kiss Comix\"; a gossip column<br />\nwhich makes Rhona Barrett seem<br />\nbearable; at least three stories per<br />\nissue on Elton John (one for, one<br />\nagainst, and the other switching<br />\npoles each month); and the<br />\nObligatory pictorial on The<br />\nTubes.<br />\nThis is first rate trash, the kind<br />\nof stuff that would do the<br />\nNational Enquirer proud. The<br />\nwriters generally seem to be<br />\nsmart enough. to know that it's<br />\ntrash, but not quite bright<br />\nenough to rise above it. As far as<br />\nself-indulgence goes, this rag tops<br />\neven 'Vat-Lamp. The<br />\nPhotography blows, and the<br />\narticles seem to have been hand<br />\nset by a man with Parkinson's<br />\ndisease, but the overall reak of<br />\nthis rag makes it somewhat<br />\nendearing. I mean, isn't this what<br />\nrock's all about?<br />\nStill, one can hardly respect a<br />\nmagazine who's Reader's Poll has<br />\nthe Stones as no. 1 R&amp;B Group,<br />\nWith Earth, Wind, and Fire third.<br />\n(The Stones in the same category<br />\nas EW&amp;F? C'mon!) And how<br />\nabout Jeff Beck's Blow by Blow<br />\nas the best Jazz album. Sure. And<br />\nLester Maddox digs James<br />\nBrOwn.<br />\nMoving into the realm of the<br />\nbasically sane, we have<br />\nDownbeat. Now Downbeat is a<br />\npeculiar case, because it is the<br />\noldest of any of these rags, dating<br />\nback to the thirties.<br />\nConsequently, the older<br />\nreadership has a tendency to<br />\nthink of Dombeat as a rock<br />\nmagazine, because of all the<br />\ncoverage they give to such<br />\nrockers as Chick Corea, John<br />\nMcLaughlin, Weather Report,<br />\nand Herbie Hancock. The<br /><br />\nyounger readers think this is a<br />\nreally hip magazine, 'cause it's<br />\ninto these cats, as well as some<br />\ndudes they've never heard of<br />\n(such as Cecil Taylor, Andrew<br />\nHill, Pepper Adams, Lee Konitz,<br />\netc.)<br />\nGet my drift? Downbeat is a<br />\nmusicians' magazine which<br />\nnon-musicians can read. The<br />\ninterviews are often the best<br />\naround, because they never waste<br />\ntime on shit like \"What was your<br />\nfirst gig?\" \"What was it like?\"...<br />\nTrouble is, there's only one<br />\nrock piece in it for every fifteen<br />\nor so jazz stories. And the record<br />\nreviews have a tendency to be<br />\nboth snotty and trendy (a<br />\ncurrent example is the feeling of,<br />\nIIif it's funky, it stinks.\"). But<br />\nthe music info and workshop tips<br />\nare invaluable, if you can use<br />\nthem.<br />\nCrawdaddy is the Newsweek<br />\nof this industry. It's slick, well<br />\nlaid out, well written, and<br />\ngenerally attractive. Except for<br />\none thing: It doesn't sell.<br />\nThe features in the magazine<br />\nare generally topical and tasteful,<br />\nwith some of the few intelligent<br />\npersonality pieces Rock<br />\nJournalism has produced (like<br />\ntheir recent Paul Simon<br />\ninterview). The record reviews<br />\napproach the status of art; a<br />\nrecent bit on Little Feat and<br />\nRobert Palmer was just brilliant<br />\nwriting. And \u2022 the jazz coverage<br />\n(an obvious attempt to gain class<br />\nby any rock magazine, hence an<br />\nexcellent focal point for<br />\nevaluation) is remarkably<br />\nknowledgeable, although<br />\nfashionably avant-garde.<br />\nBut it doesn't move. Its name,<br />\nfor one thing, sends off very bad<br />\nfeelings, awakening all of the<br />\nreaders unconscious disdain for<br />\nbluegrass and hillbilly music.<br />\nCrawdaddy; it just sounds like<br />\nhicks with banjos. And once you<br />\ndo get inside, there's the uneasy<br />\nfeeling of reading a Billboard<br />\npublication. Everything is slick,<br />\nand slick generally means<br />\n\"Record Company, PR Money.'<br />\nCrawdaddy is not bad; it is in the<br />\nunfortunate situation of being<br />\ntoo good for its genre.<br />\nAnd then there's Rolling<br />\nStone. It's very difficult to write<br />\nhere about Rolling Stone in a<br />\nderogatory fashion, because it's<br />\nkind of like supporting abortion<br />\nin an article for the Catholic<br />\nReview. But the mag has faults,<br />\nlike all institutions.<br />\nHow can anyone overlook the<br />\ngood which Rolling Stone has<br />\ndone? It gave us the Patty Hearst<br />\nstory. It gave us the best San<br />\nFrancisco rock journalism our<br />\nlittle pennies could buy. And it<br />\nkept Hunter Thompson off the<br />\nstreets.<br />\nStill, there are problems.<br />\nRolling Stone is trying very hard<br />\nto be rock's Village Voice , and<br />\nthat can be hard; after all, even<br />\nthe. Voice has trouble being the<br />\nVoice. But with Rolling Stone,<br />\nthe problem is that they rely<br />\nheavily upon personalities, and<br />\nnot all of those personalities<br />\nshould be relied on.<br />\nTake Nat Hentoff, for<br />\nexample. A man who's entire<br />\nexistence seems to be devoted to<br />\nbeing hip, Hentoff has always<br /><br />\nstruck me as a sort of Ralph<br />\nGleason without the business<br />\nsense. He knows alot of dudes,<br />\nbut he seems like the kind of guy<br />\nthey tolerate only because he'll<br />\nprint their name.<br />\nOr then there was the time<br />\ncovered the Ginsbergthey<br />\n_<br /><br />\nDylan-Baez tour, and printed<br />\nsome poems Ginsberg read at<br />\nKerouac's grave. Which would<br />\nhave been pretty hip, unless you<br />\nread the poems. Allen 'Ginsberg<br />\nwriting fourty-five cent poems<br />\nfor an eighty-five cent magazine<br />\nis alot of things, but is it art?<br /><br />\nBut what do you expect?<br />\nRolling Stone isn't much, but it's<br />\nalmost all we've got. The record<br />\nreviews are good reading, and the<br />\ngossip column is interesting, so<br />\nwhy not? It may be a C+<br />\nmagazine, but C is a passing<br />\ngrade.<br /><br />\n-My books constituted my opening it, I had to rub it all over<br />\nmost serious problem: I had with a rag, even along the tops of<br />\narranged them on the etag?re, the pages, and then I had to give<br />\nand they were the only things it a good banging: a cloud of dust<br />\nthat gave me the impression this rose from it.

WARREN<br />\n\"The season of madness was<br />\nupon the city.\"-Wes Pardue<br />\nA good friend tells the story of<br />\nthree shopkeepers who walk the<br />\nstreets of New Orleans Mardi<br />\nGras day dressed as the Fates,<br />\nClotho, Lachesis, and Atropos,<br />\nsolemnly pronouncing death<br />\nsoon for some of the<br />\nmerrymakers and granting longer<br />\nlife for others. The celebration of<br />\nMardi Gras certainly embodies all<br />\nof the possibilities. It is a holiday<br />\nfor behaving as though you will<br />\nnever see tomorrow, and yet, you<br />\nare always looking forward to the<br />\nnext year--especially when it is all<br />\nover.<br />\nMardi Gras is a wild circus<br />\nturned open party, where it<br />\nbecomes difficult to distinguish<br />\nthe animals from the spectators.<br />\nThe balls--pompous excuses for<br />\nadults to behave like reckless<br />\nteenagers--begin as early as the<br />\nsixth of January when the<br />\nTwelfth Night Revelers officially<br />\nopen the season. Parades start<br />\nabout two weeks before Fat<br />\nTuesday, this year numbering<br />\nwell over fifty. An average<br />\nmember of any of these carnival<br />\norganizations,(called krewes),<br />\nmay spend anywhere from a few<br />\nhundred to several thousand<br />\ndollars for the privilege and thrill<br />\nof throwing trinkets to the<br />\ncrowds, or perhaps being king or<br />\nqueen for a day.<br />\nMardi Gras day, the final shot<br />\nat excess before Lent, has always<br />\nbeen for me a surprisingly good<br />\ntime. My expectations and<br />\nfantasies never quite materialize,<br />\nbut I soon forget what I thought<br />\nI was after, and become sucked<br />\nup by the dual orgy of body and<br />\nmind--never quite sure which half<br />\nof me is enjoying it more.<br />\nSo, when my slaved river of an<br />\neditor discovered that the<br />\nPrincess and I were throwing<br />\ndown our books and sloughing<br />\noff overdue papers to make the<br />\nlong-heralded Mardi Gras, he<br />\nquickly turned my vacation into<br />\na newspaper assignment.<br />\nIn the course of our<br />\nnegotiations, I discovered that<br />\nmy jefelamigo had been under<br />\ncertain illusions about my<br />\nlineage. I was born at the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital and my parents<br />\nare from the Bronx. Having lived<br />\nin New Orleans for the last<br />\nthirteen years of my life, I feel a<br />\ngreat kinship with the South. But<br />\nthere is no truth to the rumors<br />\nthat I am a member of an<br />\naristocratic family, a direct<br />\ndescendant of some noble<br />\nSouthernwriter. My father is not<br />\neven a colonel.<br />\nIt would take native New<br />\nOrleanians--(pronounced,<br />\nNaw-1(e-nions)-to really show<br />\nthe Princess the magic of Mardi<br />\nGras.<br /><br />\nGoin' down<br />\n, It is a good twenty hour drive<br />\nfrom the swamps of Baltimore to<br />\nthe bayous of New Orleans. The<br /><br />\ntrip is usually a weary and dull<br />\nexperience, where one counts the<br />\nWaffle Houses and golden arches<br />\ndown the endless highway.<br />\nBathroom conditions tend to<br />\nvary with each state.<br />\nI never feel I am in the South<br />\nuntil I reach Alabama. True, the<br />\nPrincess and I heard the most<br />\namazing talk show in High Point,<br />\nNorth Carolina, where a young<br />\nboy with a thick accent tried to<br />\nconvince a dull-witted emcee that<br />\nCharles Lindbergh died in the<br />\nelectric chair; granted, that all of<br />\nthe waitresses in the truck stops<br />\nhave that remarkable ugliness<br />\nwith the piled-up hair and dented<br />\nfaces smiling when you place<br />\nyour order; but the South is<br />\nmore than hicks.<br />\n\u2022 Alabama, Mississippi and<br />\nLouisiana have a way of life<br />\nwhich is more than decadence-it<br />\nis hopeless bliss.<br />\nLike a scene from a Faulkner<br />\nnovel, it was therefore<br />\nappropriate that in the foggy<br />\ndawn of Saturday we entered the<br />\nhome state of George Corley<br />\nWallace. The mist appeared<br />\nominous but soon burnt away<br />\nunder the bright southern sun<br />\nwhich the Princess marveled at,<br />\nspeaking of high hopes to gain a<br />\nsuntan. I warned her it would \u2022<br />\nprobably rain.<br />\nGetting closer and closer to<br />\nthe Crescent City, the highway<br />\nspewed forth an onslaught of<br />\nStuckey's. This is pecan country.<br />\nPecan logs, pecan cakes, pecan<br />\npies, pecan ice cream, pecan<br />\ndolls, pecan hats, pecan<br />\nplaques--all at a remarkably<br />\nridiculous price. The radio<br />\ncrackled with Mardi Gras mambo<br />\nfrom radio station WTIX, the<br />\nmightly Tix (six) Ninety from<br />\nNew Orleans. Dr. John, The<br />\nMeters and Professor Longhair<br />\ntold me I was coming home. The<br /><br />\nPrincess had already learned the<br />\nwords to, \"They All Aksed For<br />\nYou.\"<br />\nA flat tire delayed us<br />\nmomentarily, but the sunny<br />\nsouthern weather couldn't keep<br />\nus down, and we finally got<br />\nthere--exhausted but alive, and<br />\nready for the Mardi Gras.<br />\nDowntown with the mob<br />\nWe decided to catch our first<br />\nparade, Endymion, with the<br />\nmasses on Canal Street, the heart<br />\nof downtown New Orleans. In<br />\nthe true spirit of the season, the<br />\nparade was far behind schedule.<br />\nThis gave the Philosopher --(an<br />\nancient hometown pal)--and I an<br />\nopportunity to give the Princess<br />\nher first taste of the French<br />\nQuarter, home of Bourbon Street<br />\nand legendary good times.<br />\nIt was early and, although<br />\ncrowded, only the hard core<br />\nderelicts were about, whooping it<br />\nup and guzzling wine. My mind<br />\nhad yet to embrace the revelry<br />\nand was sickened by the rampant<br />\nraunch. The scum of humanity, I<br />\ntold myself. Idle music cascaded<br />\ninto the street from all<br />\ndirections. I kicked the garbage<br />\nand wondered if I would get over<br />\nit. The Princess and the<br />\nPhilosopher were laughing.<br />\nLater, in another section of<br />\nthe business district we bumped<br />\ninto the Ty, a Mardi Gras deity<br />\nof nudity and foolishness. He<br />\nblessed us with the traditional<br />\nembraces, especially for the<br />\nPrincess, and soon made me<br />\nforget I had been so glum. The<br />\nTy told u's of great madness to<br />\ncome and predicted bright<br />\nsunshine for Mardi Gras day. I<br />\nstill suspected rain, though.<br />\nThe parade finally arrived and<br />\nthe Princess learned some basic<br />\nfacts about carnival. Especially in<br />\nthe wilds of downtown, one<br /><br />\nquickly understands the guerrilla<br />\nwarfare of Mardi Gras: parades<br />\nhave floats; floats have maskers;<br />\nmaskers are throwing<br />\nbeads, --(\"Pair of beads or string<br />\nof beads?\" the Philosopher asks)<br />\n--trinkets and doubloons; the<br />\ncrowd members will fight<br />\nbrutally to catch, pick up, or<br />\nsteal any of these relatively<br />\nworthless items, especially the<br />\ndoubloons, which are aluminum<br />\ncommemorative coins coming in<br />\nvarious colors. The law<br />\ndowntown is that the intensity of<br />\nthe fight you put up is the most<br />\nimportant thing of all. The clink<br />\nof a doubloon hitting the<br />\npavement will send the crowd<br />\ninto a frenzy.<br />\nI had almost forgotten that<br />\nthis is the year of the<br />\nbicentennial, and was terribly<br />\ndismayed to realize that even<br />\nMardi Gras would be infected.<br />\nThe Krewe of Endymion<br />\nhonored several of our chief<br />\nexecutives. I was heartened by<br />\nthe loud booing from the mob as<br />\na float bearing the head of Nixon<br />\nin a Chinese setting rolled by.<br />\nOur thumbs down, I reflected on<br />\nthe pagan origins of this now<br />\nCatholic holiday and decided<br />\nancient Rome never died.<br />\nThe parade concluded with a<br />\nlocal citizen and I agreeing that<br />\nJerry Ford had proved anybody<br />\ncould be President, as we<br />\nwatched several policemen<br />\nhandcuff and drag away a rather<br />\nviolent couple. The Princess<br />\nreturned from the front of the<br />\ncrowd, ladened with booty. She<br />\ngave me a necklace to wear and<br />\nthe Philosopher gave his<br />\ndoubloons to little children, most<br />\nof whom would sell them to<br />\ntourists.<br />\nUnder the stars, far away from<br />\ndowntown, we drank Dr. Pepper<br />\nin the Philosopher's patio, the<br />\nfountain gurgling in the<br />\nbackground. He told us of an<br />\nacquaintance of his who had<br />\ndecided not to try to catch<br />\nanything this year at the parades,<br />\nbut instead to simply watch. The<br />\nPhilosopher explained to the<br />\nPrincess, \"New Orleans is Mardi<br />\nGras at this time of the year.\" He<br />\nthen dropped a doubloon on the<br />\npatio floor and the Princess and I<br />\njerked ever so slightly at the<br />\nsound.<br /><br />\nMusic makes me wanna<br />\nA parade has certain<br />\nwell-defined protocols and each<br />\nkrewe basically ends up with the<br />\nfollowing flexible formula:<br />\nmotorcycles and horses escort<br />\nthe parade; the floats are<br />\npreceded by cars or horses<br />\nbearing the officials of the krewe;<br />\nthe first float usually carries the<br />\nking or queen; the floats are<br />\ninterspersed with bands and<br />\nother marching groups; the police<br />\nare always there.<br />\nThe captain is the most<br />\nimportant person in the<br />\norganization. He is ultimately<br />\nresponsible for everything that<br />\ngoes on. A good captain is a<br />\ndirector-choreographer-father all<br />\nrolled into one magnificent Mardi<br />\nGras costume. The monarch of<br />\nthe krewe -is literally a<br />\nfigurehead.<br />\nMusic is an important part of<br />\nNew Orleans, home of jazz and<br />\nDixieland. This is why I was very<br />\nexcited that bright sunny<br />\nSunday. The Krewe of Mid City<br />\nwould be holding its annual<br />\nparade which always featured<br />\n\"The Greatest Bands in Dixie.\"<br />\nThe Philosopher passed on the<br />\ngood advice of another friend<br />\nthat we watch the parade near<br />\nthe reviewing stand where all the<br />\nbands would play.<br />\nAt the parade site, we met up<br />\nwith our dear friend<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba, a<br />\nmember of that famous New ,<br />\nOrleans family. The Princess and<br />\nMademoiselle became friends at<br />\nonce and ran off to explore the<br />\ncrowds, leaving the Philosopher<br />\nand myself to begin a lengthy<br />\ndiscourse on whether one should<br />\nraise one hand or two when<br />\nyelling, \"Throw me something,<br />\nMister!\" to the passing floats. We<br />\nconcluded that true New<br />\nOrleanians always raised two<br />\narms and yelled their loudest.<br />\nWe were disappointed to learn<br />\nthat due to the bicentennial this<br />\nyear's Mid City parade would<br />\nhave bands from all over the<br />\nUnited States. The show was<br />\nsaved, however, by the.<br />\nhometown boys from Holy Cross'<br />\nHigh School who gave a rousing<br />\nperformance beginning with<br />\n\"Basin Street Blues,\" followed<br />\nsee ZULU, page 7<br /><br />\nmarch 5, 1976/news-letter/page 7.<br /><br />\nThe French Quarter, Zulu, and bacchanalia in the streets<br />\nZULU, from page 6<br />\nby a medley of \"The Battle<br />\nHymn of the Republic\" and<br />\n\"Dixie,\" concluding with \"Hold<br />\nThat Tiger,\" both of Holy Cross<br />\nand L.S.U. fame. The spirit of<br />\nthe Mardi Gras was getting to me,<br />\nand I could have sworn I saw the<br />\nPrincess shaking her rear to the<br />\nbeat of the passing marching<br />\nbands.<br />\nAfter the parade, the sun still<br />\nshining through the blue sky, we<br />\nentertained the Princess by<br />\nasking her to spell the name of<br />\nthat New Orlean; street which is<br />\npronounced, C/Z-pi-too-/iis. Our<br />\ndistinguished visitor was unable<br />\nto answer correctly. Can you?<br />\nTake ten seconds<br />\nWRONG! The correct answer is,<br />\n\"-Tchoupitoulas.\"<br />\nThat night we went to see one<br />\nof the youngest, but definitely<br />\none of the better, krewes in New<br />\nOrleans: Bacchus. Crowds for<br />\nthis parade are always as thick as<br />\nMarid Gras day itself. The reason<br />\nis that the floats are bigger and<br />\nmore animated than in any other<br />\nparade. This year, Bacchus<br />\nparaded through the New Orleans<br />\nSuperdome where several<br />\nthousand people had paid to hear<br />\nmusic and become part of a<br />\n\"Mardi Gras party.\"<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba<br />\nexpressed concern that this might<br />\nlead to putting Mardi Gras<br />\ncompletely in the Dome,<br />\ndestroying the greatest free show<br />\non earth. The Philosopher and I<br />\nagreed. Yes, it could even happen<br />\nhere. The thought had brought<br />\nme down, making me believe it<br />\nwould rain on Tuesday, even<br />\nthough Mademoiselle said her<br />\nastrologist had forecast perfect<br />\nweather.<br />\nCalm before the storm<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba had<br />\ntold us, \"There are two reasons<br />\nfor Mardi Gras: greed and<br />\ntackiness.\" Her words echoed<br />\nthrough my mind that perfect<br />\nMonday, walking alone through<br />\nthe French Quarter. Things were<br />\nmore sedate, with the derelicts<br />\nand youths sleeping where they<br />\ncould, the shops open for<br />\nbusiness with the well-dressed<br />\ntourists, and the joints airing<br />\nthemselves out, getting ready for<br />\nmore nighttime madness.<br />\nReligious hustlers swarmed on<br />\nthe Royal Street promenade. A<br />\nyoung girl pinned a carnation on<br />\nme in the name of Hare Krishna.<br />\nOver a fried oyster sandwich, I<br />\nreflected that most people ignore<br />\nthe fact that the Quarter is<br />\nmainly a residential area. Unlike<br />\nthe Block, the French Quarter is<br />\na very beautiful place with<br />\nhouses containing grillwork<br />\nbalconies overlooking high-walled<br />\ncourtyards. This is the original<br />\ncity. Ah, New Orleans, I thought,<br />\nthey call you the city that Care<br />\nforgot. You are such a wonderful<br />\nplace, and yet so sad. Decadence<br />\nis your mistress and life is hearty.<br />\nBut how long can it last? Nothing<br />\nis forever, I reminded myself.<br />\nNot even Mardi Gras, most likely.<br />\nThat touch of melancholy had<br />\ncome to me again.<br />\nThat night we were privileged<br />\nto see the Proteus Parade from a<br />\nbalcony on St. Charles Avenue, a<br /><br />\nstreet which begins as skid row<br />\ndowntown and goes to the other<br />\nend of the city, becoming the<br />\nscene for some of the most<br />\nexclusive residences in town. The<br />\nbalcony party was something<br />\nvery dear to me, for nothing<br />\nmakes me happier than the sight<br />\nof New Orleanians eating<br />\ncrawfish and talking while the<br />\nAllman Brothers play in the<br />\nbackground.<br />\nThe Princess earned her key to<br />\nthe city that night by starting a<br />\nparty on a streetcar. It all began<br />\nwhen she asked the other riders<br />\nto sign her transfer. This opened<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\npassing right in front of me, and<br />\nall of a sudden the sun started to<br />\nbreak through and I knew this<br />\nwas going to be my best Mardi<br />\nGras ever.<br />\nZulu is a burlesque of the rest<br />\nof the parades. (But what is a<br />\nburlesque of the burlesque?) The<br />\nfloats have no titles and the<br />\ndoubloons bear no theme, but<br />\ninstead honor an African animal.<br />\nKrewe members do themselves<br />\nup in blackface and dress in garb<br />\nwhich white America has decided<br />\nis the look of the African native.<br />\nBut the best things Zulu has to<br />\noffer are the prized coconuts.<br /><br />\ncemetery when he was a young<br />\nboy. Now he lived in Greenwhich<br />\nVillage. He, too, shared my<br />\nfascination with man's most<br />\nunusual enterprise, the cemetery.<br />\nThe symbolism behind the<br />\nstatues used on graves interested<br />\nmy friend a great deal. A<br />\ndespondent figure carrying an<br />\nextinguished torch marked the<br />\ngrave of the head of a household.<br />\nFor a tomb mostly inhabited by<br />\nyoung children, there was a<br />\nweeping angel. Many graves had<br />\nthe figure of a resting lamb. The<br />\npeace of the afterworld, I<br />\nventured.<br />\nBut the cries of the present<br />\nworld made me remember a<br />\npromise I had made to myself to<br />\ngo to the Quarter and see the<br />\ncostume contest. The stranger<br />\nand I parted. What an odd and<br />\nwonderful thing to make a friend<br />\nin a cemetery.<br />\nI will not bother with the<br />\ndetails of how I managed to walk<br />\nsome thirty blocks to my<br />\ndestination. (I am not all that<br />\nsure myself.) But I did reach the<br />\ncorner of Bourbon and Dumaine,<br />\nand there from several angles<br />\nobserved some of the most<br />\nbeautiful and interesting<br />\ncostumes I have ever seen.<br />\nThe annual costume contest is<br />\nsponsored by one of the gay bars<br />\nin the Quarter, and most of the<br />\ncontestants are from that part of<br />\nthe community. I am not about<br />\nto make any stupid<br />\ngeneralizations about gay people<br />\nand good times, but that end of<br />\nthe Quarter always has the best<br />\npartying, and Mardi Gras day lays<br />\nthe ground work for real<br />\nbacchanalia.<br />\nIt starts off with little things<br />\nlike guys in drag as nuns, lifting<br />\ntheir skirts to the eager crowds.<br />\nMany of the contestants are<br />\naccompanied by huge entourages,<br />\nthe group creating a court<br />\nspectacle. These queens really go<br />\nin style, being carried around by<br />\na score of slaves adorned with<br />\nhuge peacock and ostrich<br />\nfeathers, wearing little else. The<br />\nqueens are truly stunning,<br />\nputting most of the real women<br /><br />\nThese are truly the treasures of<br />\nMardi Gras because it is virtually<br />\nimpossible to get one. They<br />\nmeant more than any rare<br />\ndoubloon could. I saw crowds<br />\nbeing taunted by those maskers<br />\nholding coconuts inches from<br />\ntheir outstretched hands. Maybe<br />\nI'll get a coconut in the next<br />\n.thirteen years.<br />\nZulu's unplanned turn down<br />\nthe avenue had backed up the<br />\nmany marching clubs which<br />\nprecede Rex, the king of carnival.<br />\nThese groups consist of very<br />\ndrunk members who carry paper<br />\nQueens and dreams<br />\nflowers to be given to females for<br />\nUpon waking up that morning, kisses along the way. Obviously,<br />\nI felt a little smug because the there is some symbolism<br />\ncity was covered by an ugly grey involving deflowering here,<br />\nsky. Masochistically, I envisioned although, like everything else at<br />\ndrenching thunder storms. Why the Mardi Gras, it is bass<br />\nnot, I mused. It would be ackwards. This year there was<br />\neven a female walking<br />\nsomething new for Mardi Gras.<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba had club --Stocking Strutters-arranged for us to base ourselves appropriately giving out garters<br />\nat a luxurious St. Charles instead of flowers.<br />\nresidence. The Princess was<br />\nJubilant from finding Zulu, I<br />\nseeing everything first class.<br />\ncontinued to obey my impulses<br />\nI had promised myself that I and dragged Mademoiselle and<br />\nwould go the Mardi Gras as the Princess to explore a<br />\nmyself, (something I rarely do), cemetery I had passed. On the<br />\nand follow whatever my instincts way there, we met the Ty, on his<br />\ntold me to do. I knew I would be way to flash the mayor. He<br />\nrunning around alot, taking notes sprayed my hair silver, turning<br />\nof all there was to see. (I was me into an old man, and vanished<br />\nbeing a very conscientious in a puff of smoke. Was the early<br />\nreporter.)<br />\nmorning drinking getting to me,<br />\nIn the early hours of the or was it just the Mardi Gras? It's<br />\nmorning, it is fun just to walk only begun, I thought.<br />\naround and look at the costumes<br />\nThe sounds of the approaching<br />\npeople have put together for parade sent Mademoiselle<br />\ncarnival. Couples, especially, use Pontalba and the Princess<br />\na great deal of imagination. I saw running back to the main<br />\nsoldiers, trees, and packs of thoroughfare. I decided to<br />\ncigarettes, Marlboro and Virginia remain in the cemetery,<br />\nSlims.) One couple featured the marveling at the fact that I had<br />\nhelpless male tied up and being seen Zulu which before I had<br />\nonly heard about, and would<br />\ndragged by his mate.<br />\nA very marvelous thing then now hear Rex which I had always<br />\nhappened to me--I bumped into seen. There amidst the graves and<br />\nZulu. Up until recently the only the flowers I sat down and<br />\nt<br />\nblack carnival organization, Zulu wondered who I would be for z<br />\nis considered a piece of magic in Lent.<br />\nI expected to spend that time ;<br />\nsome circles because it never<br />\nfollows any parade route. For the alone, but a stranger appeared<br />\nlast twelve years I had never and before either of us knew it, c\"<br />\nfound Zulu, and had no hope of we were talking like old friends. .2<br />\ndoing so. But there it was, He told me he used to play in the z.<br />\nup friendly relations and the<br />\npassing of wine. As the streetcar<br />\ngrew more crowded, the party<br />\nbecame much louder. The four of<br />\nus had to jump out the window<br />\nwhen we reached our stop. A<br />\nfrustrated lover yelled to<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba to come<br />\nback, as the streetcar pulled<br />\naway.<br />\nIt was only midnight, but<br />\ntomorrow would be a long day.<br />\nWe would need all the sleep we<br />\ncould get and then some.<br /><br />\non the street to shame.<br />\nContestants and their groups<br />\ncome in from all sides of the<br />\nstreets, making their way through<br />\nthe thick, sweating crowds. The<br />\nmost memorable entrance I<br />\nobserved was that of a silver god<br />\nemerging from Bourbon Street.<br />\nOn his loin cloth was a set of<br />\nmagnificent stag horns, whin he<br />\nproudly caressed in front of all of<br />\nus, alternating with the eating of<br />\ngrapes, the only thing not silver<br />\nabout him.<br />\nBehind the stage, contestants<br />\nand admirers milled in the hot<br />\nafternoon sun. Debauchery was<br />\nat its finest. A couple proudly<br />\nmade love. Stray hands would<br />\ngrab you now and then. If you<br />\nwere lucky, you would see who it<br />\nwas and grab back.<br />\nUp a block, at the intersection<br />\nof two of the city's most famous<br />\ngay bars, a wild disco was in<br />\nprogress in the street. Bourbon<br />\nPub had its speakers on the<br />\nbalcony. I bumped with the<br />\npartiers below. This was Mardi<br />\nGras.<br />\nHow I ended up on<br />\nMademoiselle Pontalba's front<br />\nlawn complaining about a<br />\nheadache, I'll never know.<br />\nOf course, there are a few<br />\nthings I've left out. That night we<br />\nwent back to the french Quarter<br />\nso Mademoiselle and the Princess<br />\ncould get hundreds of Mardi Gras<br />\nkisses from the drunk strangers.<br />\nAn old friend wanted to take the<br />\nPhilosopher mnd I home, but I<br />\ndeclined explaining to him that<br />\nthe Philosopher does not get into<br />\nthat sort of thing, and I would be<br />\nback in the summer. There were<br />\nalso the Jesus people telling us to<br />\nrepent. To me, that was just<br />\nanother costume. And, sure<br />\nenough, we had the reprise of<br />\nanother flat tire on the way<br />\nhome.<br />\nThere is no easy way to talk<br />\nabout Mardi Gras. It is the most<br />\namazing experience in the United<br />\nStates. And if Atropos does not<br />\ncut my thin thread of life short, I<br />\npromise to be back again next<br />\nyear.

Perhaps<br />\nher highness was not the best<br />\nchoice. I believe that these, and<br />\nother questions pertaining to the<br />\nunderlying circumstances remain<br />\nto be seen. The shocking fact<br />\nremains that the Hopkins<br />\nintelligensia were so naively<br />\nimpressed by the lies, and<br />\nexremist views of the Iranian<br />\nStudents' Association. The I.S.A.<br />\nis merely a group of frustrated,<br />\ninfantile, and mentally unstable<br />\nmarxists who do not have the<br />\ndignity, or the courage of voicing<br />\ntheir criticisms in their own land.<br />\nSuch people as Mike<br />\nHoffheimer attribute their<br />\nactivities to the fact that the<br />\ngranting of the degree was \"an<br />\ninsult to thP Iranian People\". I<br />\nsincerely refuse to believe that<br />\nthe Iranian People would desire<br />\nthe representation of Mr.<br />\nHoffheimer, and the members of<br />\nthe I.S.A. Have any of the people<br />\n\\ to associate the granting 01 tne<br /><br />\ndegree with \"a disgrace to<br />\nHopkins\" stopped to think about<br />\ntheir own actions? I fail to see<br />\nthe difference between that<br />\n''possible\" disgrace, and the<br />\n\"certain\" ignomony brought<br />\nupon the university by the<br />\nsupport given to a revolutionary<br />\ngroup such as the Iranian<br />\nStudents' Association.<br />\nFarid Gharagozloo<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI thoroughly enjoyed your<br />\nsatirical representation of the<br />\nelitist attitude that pervades the<br />\nvery tennis magazines of<br />\nvenerable St. Elmo Hall.<br />\nOf course, the article on Delta<br />\nPhi wasn't the masterful satire it<br />\ncame across to be, but it most<br />\nassuredly could have been.

We would<br />\nlike to explain our reasons.<br />\nThe Shah of Iran is a ruthless<br />\ndictator with no respect<br />\nwhatsoever for human rights or<br />\ncivil liberties. The widespread use<br />\nof torture by the Iranian secret<br />\npolice, both in Iran and abroad,<br />\nis a matter of international<br />\nscandal. Amnesty International<br />\nand the International Federation<br />\nof Human Rights report more<br />\nthan 100,000 political prisoners<br />\nin Iran at the present time and<br />\nsome 300 official executions in<br />\nthe last three years, while Ivan<br />\nMorris, Chairman of the Board of<br />\nAmnesty International, has<br />\nstated that, \"Iran has the worst<br />\nrecord of political repression in<br />\nthe world.\" (New York Times,<br />\nFebruary 29, 1976).<br />\nWhile it would be unfortunate<br />\nwere we to visit the sins of all<br />\nbrothers on their sisters, we note<br />\nin this case that the Shah's<br />\nimmediate family constitutes the<br />\ncore of the power structure in<br />\nIran and that Princess Ashraf is<br /><br />\nvery active in State affairs. We<br />\nconsider the award of an<br />\nhonorary degree to her as an act<br />\nwhich directly condones the<br />\nwidespread disregard for civil and<br />\nhuman rights in Iran.

They<br />\nare real, and steadfast in their<br />\nreality. When the recognized<br />\nlandmarks and bellwethers of our<br />\nday crumble into obscurity, the<br />\nbottle will remain, refuge of all<br />\npeoples. The bottle is more than<br />\njust a magnificently contorted<br />\npiece of glass, it is history itself,<br />\nsymbol of many a good man's<br />\nlife.<br />\nBut then bottles have always<br />\nbeen important to me. Bottled<br />\nmemories burst from my brain,<br />\nshifting in mood from the black<br />\nto euphoric. I remember the milk<br />\nbottle that was hurled at my<br />\nUncle Ernie's saddle brown<br />\nVolvo during a riot in East<br />\nDetroit back in '65. The bottle<br />\nb roke through the windshield<br />\n.and whizzed across my head,<br />\nleaving a gash which is now a<br />\nflashy Detroit scar. Some may<br />\nsay the world is a ghet-to, but<br />\nme, well, I say the world is a<br />\nbottle.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nA classic rememberance is the<br />\nsmall container of Romilar cough<br />\nmedicine in the bathroom closet,<br />\na bottle whose label is streaked<br />\nwith the aged maroon syrup that<br />\nanyone in his right mind cringes<br />\nat. No, bottles aren't always fun<br />\nwhen you're not of age.<br />\nMy first great bottle<br />\nexperience came when I was<br />\nthirteen, while romping aloug the<br />\nshores of Lake Ontario. I was<br />\nkicking up some sand when I<br />\nfound a boat in a bottle, carrying<br />\na note which read: \"They tried<br />\nto anchor me in Boston. Tried to<br />\ncram that damn piety from my<br />\ntoes to my scalp. But I'm gone<br />\nforever, they ain't gonna find me.<br />\nAn' I'm so happy I gotta let it<br />\nout. So I send this boat in a<br />\nbottle, with regards to all who<br />\nfind it. You should always keep a<br />\nbottle by your side, a bottle to<br />\ngo, a bottle to throw, 'cause a<br />\nbottle will keep you aglow!<br />\nSigned Cameron Quincy, Port<br />\nJefferson, N.Y., October 13,<br />\n1912.\"<br />\nI took this sailor's advice and<br />\nwatched my bottle memories<br />\nclimb. Like the time I snitched<br /><br />\ntwo bottles of champagne at<br />\nAunt Connie's wedding, way<br />\nbefore my stomach had grown<br />\nup. Or the bottles of dollar apple<br />\nwine that we all passed around<br />\nwhile out on a cruise. And need I<br />\nmention the piles of beer bottles<br />\nthat have been tossed in bars and<br />\nbackyards, Buicics, and ballparks?<br />\nStill, the bottle's future is<br />\nbleak. Flip top cans (crush,<br /><br />\ncrunch, and zip, into the garbage)<br />\nhave stolen the thunder. It seems<br />\nthat antiquated Coke and<br />\nSeven-up bottles are found only<br />\nin tiny Midwestern and Southern<br />\ntowns, locked up in soda<br />\nmachines that demand just<br />\nfifteen cents. The age of the<br />\nbottle is clearly in danger.<br />\nChampions of the bottle like<br />\nmyself are hard<br />\nput to defend<br /><br />\nour eccentricity. It's not easy to<br />\npour out my feelings this way<br />\nwithout undue sentiment, but<br />\nthe person who appreciates the<br />\nbottle today is so rare.And let us<br />\nremember that some beach was<br />\ndeprived of countless grains of<br />\nsand so that you may marvel at<br />\nthe bottle between your teeth.<br />\nI think the least we can do is<br />\ndrink to it.<br /><br />\nJust who says the Student Council hasn't worked together?<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\n\"WHO SAYS THE STUDENT<br />\nCOUNCIL HASN'T WORKED<br />\nTOGETHER?\" Appropriately<br />\nenough, the Student Council<br />\nmembers themselves did\u2014which<br />\nmakes it difficult to understand<br />\nwhy they responded at all to<br />\ntheir own criticism, much less<br />\nwith the huge, bloated broadside<br />\nthat appeared in this paper last<br />\nTuesday.<br />\nIt seems unbecoming of an<br />\nelected body that purports to<br />\nhold \"the undergraduates best<br />\ninterest\" at heart to wave a list of<br />\n\"accomplishments\" in the faces<br />\nof its constituents like some<br />\ndesperate job applicant<br />\nbrandishing a portfolio, and<br />\nalmost obscene for it to devote<br />\n$125, the cost of that full-page<br />\nself-congratulation, towards that<br />\nend.<br />\nBut aside from the<br />\ntransparency of this pre-election<br />\ntime ploy, and this flagrant<br />\nmisuse of the SC exchequer,<br />\nthere is a more basic wrong\u2014the<br />\nfoistering of an outrageous<br />\ndeceit.

SRYGLEY<br />\nI reached the perimeter of<br />\nParis at one a.m., with no hope<br />\nof finding a place to stay. My car<br />\nAmstraat and I spent the night in<br />\na well-lit rest area, where I laid<br />\non my back across the<br />\nnone-too-large front seat, my feet<br />\nstuck out the open window.<br />\nAmstraat, I suppose, enjoyed the<br />\nrest.<br />\nI woke at seven, stretched<br />\nguardedly, found two<br />\nuncommonly painful cricks in<br />\nmy neck and back, and drove on<br />\ninto the traffic jam which had<br />\nsprung up in anticipation of my<br />\narrival near the Charles de<br />\nGaulle airporti. This unexpected<br />\npleasure, the French<br />\nembouteillage, did nothing to<br />\nundo the knots the brain was<br />\ntying in my poor, strained<br />\nmuscles, but I am still glad that I<br />\nhad the chance to endure it, for<br />\nit gave me my first insight into<br />\nthe at once delicate and<br />\naggressive character of the<br />\nnatives. Anything which I learned<br />\nabout the Parisian character after<br />\nthat morning only added tepid<br />\nbrowns and greens to the first<br />\nhot splashes of red and orange<br />\nwith which I first, and correctly,<br />\ncanvassed them. The beguiling<br />\ninhabitants of Paris have acquired<br />\na lengthy list of cultural<br />\nattributes since the disappearance<br />\nof their hairy ancestors, the<br />\nParisii tribe, from the Isle in the<br />\ncenter of the Seine; stuffy<br />\nmannerisms, an introspective<br />\nsophistication, and the Mona<br />\nLisa, to name a few, but at heart,<br />\nand deep in his guts, the average<br />\nParisian has a secret wish to be<br />\nNapolean IV, worldconquerer. I<br />\nsuppose it was the unsuspected<br />\neruption of the Maginot Line<br />\nwhich caused the psychological<br />\ntrauma which, made today's<br />\nParisian the confused<br />\nschizophrenic that he is. I will<br />\nnever forget the hostile sarcastic<br />\nroar of the low lying Citroen,<br />\nnever forget the maniacal laugh<br />\nof each bellicose driver as one<br />\nafter another they strove for the<br />\npetite space which Amstraat and<br />\nI occupied so innocently, so<br />\nharmlessly. What severity! What<br />\nintimidation! First the barrage,<br />\nthen the blitzkrieg, they lunged,<br />\nwe dodged, Amstraat hid herself<br />\nbetween two cement trucks, but<br />\nnever an end to the fierce<br />\nonslaught. Vaarrroom! And then,<br />\njust when I thought it was certain<br />\ndestruction or over the guard-rail,<br />\nAmstraat showed me what a<br />\nSpartan she could be. Attack? We<br />\ndared, we ran the gauntlet in<br /><br />\ndefiance at close quarters;<br />\nimmediately our harsh assailants<br />\nwere thrown into confusion.<br />\nAmstraat had finally cleared her<br />\nthroat, and I had come with new<br />\nand unforseen tactics, for once,<br />\nlong ago, I had vied with the very<br />\nbest in the toughest arena in the<br />\nworld: New York, they will<br />\nalways sing your praise...<br />\nFinally, Amstraat, I, and our<br />\nbreathless pursuers came to the<br />\ngreat belt which circumscribes<br />\nParis. A great sign figured the<br />\nchoice I could not make: Paris<br />\nL'Ouest? Paris L'Est? Purely by<br />\ncoincidence it was another grey<br />\nVolkswagen which forced us<br />\nfrom our indecision, and we<br />\nturned West, which, incidentally,<br />\nturned out to be the wrong way.<br />\nKilometers later, Amstraat and I<br />\nentered the great confusion of<br />\nasphalt, cobblestones, and<br />\ncroissants which is Paris. It was,<br />\nbelieve me, no cure for my latent<br />\nromanticism that we entered that<br />\ngreat .city somewhere between<br />\nChaillot and Montmartre, in the<br />\nspiritual shadow- of the Sacre<br />\nCour.<br />\nThe casual American reader<br />\nwho has never been to Paris<br />\ncannot understand the stress and<br />\nstamina which is required of<br />\nevery Parisian driver without<br />\nstretching the imagination: Death<br />\nlurks in spots seen and unforseen.<br />\nParis has the absolute minimum<br />\nof the necessary traffic signals,<br />\nand an amazing lack of careful,<br />\nthoughtful drivers. Amstraat and<br />\nI circumvented destruction only<br />\nby sheer luck, and never allowed<br />\nourselves an easy moment until<br />\nwe were parked in virtual asylum<br />\nbeneath the Eiffel Tower.<br />\nHow did it happen that we<br />\nmanaged to make our way across<br />\nParis without even a map? I<br />\nremmembered a patent<br />\nexpression which had long agc<br /><br />\nSATURDAY, March 6, 8 PM<br />\nKUMSITZ<br />\nFisher Lounge?<br />\nAdmission $1.00<br />\nGuitarist<br /><br />\nbeen tucked away in the archives<br />\nof my mind? a who is it, what is<br />\nit, where is it expression which<br />\nbecame my key to the French<br />\nworld:<br />\n\"Pourriez-vous m'indiquer...\"<br />\nI had already been to the top<br />\nof the Tour d'Eiffel many times<br />\nbefore in daydreams; I had even<br />\nbeen thrown off it by a man in a<br />\ngorilla suit in the nightmares of<br />\nmy eight-year-old mind, though<br />\nat that time I did not hit the<br />\nground because I had no idea<br />\nwhat the terrain below would be<br />\nlike: when there are no visuals,<br />\nthere are no dreams.<br />\nIt was nine o'clock; the tower<br />\nwould open at ten. I looked<br /><br />\nforward to the elevator ascension<br />\nwith a mixture of excitement and<br />\nthe anticipation of<br />\ndisappointment. Could it<br />\npossibly be as good as I had<br />\ndreamed it to be? I contented<br />\nmyself with a leisurely stroll<br />\naround the trim park beneath,<br />\nwhere I found myself<br />\nexceptionally pleased with its<br />\nsymmetries: every tree, every<br />\nbench, every side path had its<br />\nidentical counterpart just<br />\nopposite. Is it so strange then<br />\nthat for every step I took I<br />\nimagined another step of the<br />\nsame distance, the same weight,<br />\nthe same sound on the twin path,<br />\na step placed perhaps by another<br />\nsix-foot, bearded, blue- eyed<br />\nstudent of nineteen years like<br />\nme?

The most<br /><br />\nimportant was lack of depth at<br />\nmidfield.<br />\nSo, following the script<br />\nperfectly, Don Aimmerman<br />\nHopkins' highest scoring middie,<br />\nin practice last week, tore<br />\ncartilage in his knee.

He had obviously, by<br /><br />\nhis play last year, completely<br />\nrecovered from that injury, only<br />\nto be struck again this year.<br />\nThis further complicates an<br />\nalready unsettled situation in the<br />\nmidfield.<br />\nLack of depth is a problem<br />\nwhich can be overcome against<br />\nsome teams the Jays play because<br />\nof sheer talent.

Of the three, the biggest<br />\nsurprise has probably been<br />\nHuntley.

We expect them to be<br />\nresponsible for team attitude and<br />\nmorale and nofify the coaches bf<br />\nany problems that might pop up.<br />\nAfter all it's easy for guys,<br />\nespecially those who aren't<br />\nplaying, to start bitching and<br />\nthat's where the captains play a<br />\nkey role.\"<br />\n\"They did a great job last<br />\nyear,\" Chic continued, \"and we<br />\nexpect the same. It goes beyond<br />\njust leadership on the field but<br />\nthis extends to all situations, off<br />\nthe field as well.\"<br />\n\"I try to lead by example,\"<br />\nexplained Moorhead. \"I try to<br />\nuse the experience I have from<br />\nplaying on the varsity in the past<br />\nto help out some of the younger<br />\nplayer. By hustling myself,<br />\nhopefully that will encourage the<br />\nothers to do the same.\"<br />\nAfter haveing gained a year of<br />\non-the-job training, Kohler<br /><br />\nnoted, \"I think we all learned<br />\nsomething from last year.<br />\nPersonally, \"I was only a junior<br />\nlast season and a little reserved<br />\nabout offering constructive<br />\ncriticisms to others. This year,<br />\nbeing a senior and having gained<br />\nexperience, I'm more confident<br />\nof being able to advise others.<br />\nOverall I'd say we're a lot<br />\nhungrier this year and really<br />\nlooking forward to the season.\"<br /><br />\nLacrosse<br />\ntomorrow<br />\nThe unveiling of the 1976<br />\nHopkins lacrosse team will take<br />\nplace tomorrow when the Blue<br />\nJays meet the Quakers of the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania at<br />\nPenn's Franklin Field at 1:30.<br />\nThough the contest is only a<br />\npre-season scrimmage it will be<br />\nan opportunity to get an early<br />\nlook at the Hopkins line-up.<br /><br />\nHopkins head coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone was very cautious in<br />\ncommenting. on the Jays first<br />\nintercollegiate meeting of the<br />\nseason.<br />\n\"We're gonna make mistakes,\"<br />\nChic admitted, \"and the main<br />\nthing that we want to get out of<br />\nthis is the correction of those<br />\nmistakes. Penn's been out a<br />\nmonth longer than we have and<br />\nthat will certainly give them a<br />\ndefinite advantage. They have an<br />\nexcellent team, having finished<br />\nsixth in the nation last year,<br />\nqualifying for the playoffs.\"<br />\nThe Quakers lost in the first<br />\nround to eventual finalist Navy,<br />\nandthe Red and Blue return most<br />\nof the players from last year's<br />\nsquad.<br />\n\"We only beat them 13-11 last<br />\nyear (also in the Jays' opening<br />\nscrimmage) so we know they'll<br />\nbe tough.

She took her shoes off and<br />\nwalked on, marveling at the feel of the<br />\ncushion below her tiring feet. She walked<br />\nin much more comfort now and it was<br />\nnot long before she saw a break in the<br />\ntrees\u2014Another trail. She put her shoes<br />\non and went up to the edge, where she<br />\nsaw two men laying railroad track down<br />\nthe center of the footway.<br />\n\"Pardon me,\" she excused herself,<br />\n\"but could either of you tell me which<br />\ntrail I've stumbled onto?\"<br />\n\"Ah'll handle this 'tin,\" the big worker<br />\ntole the other man. He turned to face her<br />\nand Alice found herself confronted by a<br />\ncorpulent walrus. \"Well, I think this<br />\n'un'll be psychology, now. Why?\"<br />\n\"I just wanted to know. I seem to be<br />\nlost.\"<br />\n\"Lost in Homewoodland? Tch. Tch.\"<br />\nAlice's attention was diverted by the<br />\ntrack.\"What are you doing?\"<br />\n\"Why, I'm layin' track. Ain't that<br />\nplain enough?\"<br />\n\"Yes. Yes, it is. Buy why?\"<br />\n\"The Queen wants ta speed up the<br />\nfolks on the paths.\"<br />\n\"But you'll need trains and engineers.<br />\nWhat for?\"<br />\n\"We'll need trains,\" he corrected her,<br />\nignoring the pertinent question.<br /><br />\n\"No engineers?\"<br />\n\"Nope. You don't need no engineer if<br />\nthe track don't have no switchpoints,<br />\nnow do ya?\"<br />\n\"Well, yes, I should think you would.<br />\nWhat if...\"<br />\n\"Bah!\" the Walrus snorted. He turned<br />\nto the track and told the man how to do<br />\nthe work.\"Bullshit.\"<br />\nAlice decided that it was an opportune<br />\ntime to resume her journey and so<br />\nquietly slipped back through the<br />\nunderbrush.<br />\nAs dusk was settling, Alice was still in<br />\nthe thick of the forest. Fear was<br />\ngrappling up her backbone, making dull<br />\nthuds as it climbed up each disc. Her<br />\neyes shifted nervously in anticipation of<br />\nodd creatures. \"Oh dear. I hope I find a<br />\nfootpath before dark,\" she said to the<br />\nforest.<br />\n\"Which path would that be?\" a voice<br />\ncalled out.<br />\n\"Huh? Pardon me?\" Alice looked<br />\nabout, saw nothing.<br />\n\"Up here,\" the voice explained.<br />\nAlice looked up to_find a plump pink<br />\ncat lying lazily on the branches, of the<br />\nevergreen above. \"Oh, hello.\"<br />\n\"Hello,\" said the cat, and stared<br />\nsilently.<br />\nAlice regarded him more closely. He<br />\nwas not really so much like a cat as a<br />\nsilly quffed representation of one. He<br />\nhad lavender stripes across the length of<br />\nhis back and a toothy grin that showed<br />\nthree times as much sparkling human<br />\ndentition than a cat's mouth has any<br />\nright to do.\"Who are you?\"<br />\n\"That is the caterpillar's question,<br />\nbuffoon. Anyway, I am the Cheshire<br /><br />\nCat.\"<br />\n\"Well, Cheshire hiss,\" she boldly<br />\nendeared him, \"could you tell me which<br />\nway one ought to walk to reach a path?\"<br />\n\"That would surely depend on where<br />\none wishes to be going.\"<br />\n\"But I'm afraid I'm not quite certain<br />\nyet where I want to be.\"<br />\n\"Want it or not, you are quite<br />\ncertainly where you are.\"<br />\n,`But I hope to get somewhere.<br />\nPerhaps you could help me decide,\" she<br />\nprompted.<br />\n\"I don't think I could do that. You<br />\nsee, I wouldn't care.\"<br />\n\"I can understand that, but I do care.\"<br />\n\"Well,\" grinned the Cat, \"what would<br />\nyou like to be doing for the rest of your<br />\nlife?\"<br />\n\"1...well I'm afraid I just don't know.\"Then take any path or paths you<br />\nplease. It makes no difference.\"<br />\nAlice noticed at this point that the<br />\nstripes of the Cat were unwinding. She<br />\nstared in wonder as the lavender stripes<br />\nvanished silently. \"It makes no<br />\ndifference?\"<br />\n\"No,\" said the Cat who was now just a<br />\nfading head.<br />\n\"But why not?\" she gulped.<br />\n\"Because you won't get a job when<br />\nyou get out of here anyway, the smiling<br />\nteeth answered. This was all that was left<br />\nof the Cheshire Cat, and it too dissipated<br />\ninto a soft glow, faded into the night.<br />\n\"Oh dear,\" Alice whispered. She<br />\ndecided to stay in the forest until<br />\nmorning, for it was now too dark to find<br />\none's way in the woods. With a pad of<br />\nmoss for a pillow, she soon fell into a<br />\ndeep, dreamless sleep.<br /><br />\n(-)<br /><br />\n\u2014\u2022<br /><br />\nCD<br /><br />\nCD<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41109, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "9a9a5502-c21e-411e-91f3-c853bcf8aa8b", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14308-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14308, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "820dd8af-05e5-4861-a977-d592388a4e5c", "url": "/node/14308"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "a4aa0c83-717d-4b5f-879d-76850fdbd310"}]}
