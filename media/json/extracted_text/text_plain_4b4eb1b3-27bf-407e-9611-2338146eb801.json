Altogether the<br />\nteam won four games, lost four<br />\nand tied one. The state championshop honors were again carried off<br />\nby Maryland State, which was<br />\nrepresented by one of the strongest<br />\nteams ever turned out at that institution. St. John's was tied in<br />\none of the closest games staged between_ the two colleges for a number of years. The new coaching<br />\nsystem, in full effect for the first<br />\ntime, proved to be a success, the<br />\nfull measure of which cannot be<br />\nfelt for a number of years. The<br />\nschedule was hard, and it was not<br />\npossible to have the hours for collegiate duties so arranged that the<br />\nteam could get all the real practice it should have had. It is to<br />\nbe hoped that in the future laboratories and afternoon classes can be<br />\nso arranged that the team will be<br />\nable to get in at least two hours of<br />\nreal practice each day. This has<br />\nhen done in Harvard, Yale and<br />\nothers of the large colleges. Students and faculty should be willing and glad to go out of their way<br />\nto promote better athletics at Hopkins.<br />\nIn the first game of the year Mt.<br />\nSt. Mary's was met and defeated,<br />\n13 to 6. The team had been on the<br />\nfield only a week or so, and a lack<br />\nof training was very evident. The<br />\nup-staters were light but fast, and<br />\nwhile in no danger of losing at<br />\nany time, Hopkins was forced to<br />\ndisplay its best to win. It became<br />\nevident that the team was especially in need of an experienced<br />\ncenter to make a good showing.<br />\nCashell had been moved from his<br />\nold position at fullback into that<br />\nplace, but his passing was badly<br />\noff color. The backfield displayed<br />\nplenty of punch, but it was very<br />\nevident that it needed practice in<br />\norder to work together.<br />\nOn the following 'Saturday the<br />\nNavy was met at Annapolis, and,<br />\nas every one expected, Hopkins<br />\nwas badly beaten, but anything<br />\nbut disgraced, the Midshipmen<br />\nwalking off with the lona end of a<br />\n66-to-0 score. In the ''first half<br />\n-Coach Murphy, who did not wish<br />\nto take any chances with his firststring men, sent in the second and<br />\nthird teams, and the Navy managed to roll up 48 points.

First the Midshipmen and<br />\nthen Hopkins would takes the lead.<br />\nGood, snappy teamwork on both<br />\nsides predominated, but the<br />\nmarksmanship was below par.<br />\nSeveral times Hopkins had chances<br />\nto score easy goals, but hasty<br />\nshooting spoiled their aim. Long<br />\nshots on the part of Weiner and<br />\nCuneo cropped out again, but<br />\nwithout suaess. Byerle was the<br />\nstar performer for the Annapolitans, seeming to be able to find the<br />\nbasket from any angle, dropping<br />\nin two goals by tossing the leather<br />\nover his shoulders. At another<br />\ntime, after Watters had missed a<br />\nfoul, Ile jumped up, tapping the<br />\nball back into the basket as it fell.<br />\nNavy started off with a jump,<br />\nforcing Hopkins to assume the defensive.

Cuneo netted a foul, and then clever team<br />\nwork on the part of Weiner and<br />\nCuneo enabled the latter to score,<br />\nand Hopkins was ahead. Byerle<br />\nagain turned the tables by netting<br />\na long shot. The score see-sawed<br />\nback and forth, till just before the<br />\nwhistle Navy took a spurt and the<br />\nhalf ended 15-11 in the favor of<br />\nthe home team.<br />\nAt the beginning of the second<br />\nperiod Weiner netted two goals in<br />\nrapid succession, tieing the count.<br />\nHowever, this seemed to be the<br />\nlimit of the efforts of the Black<br />\nand Blue, for during the remainder of the contest only one more<br />\nbasket was netted, while the future admirals piled up the score.<br />\nThe five was much more successful against Gallaudet on Friday<br />\nat Washington.

Lo.vejoy. As President<br />\nof the American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors, Dr. Lovejoy is eminently qualified to discuss the teaching profession. Of<br />\nthe university teacher Ile said that<br />\nit should be clearly understood<br />\nthat a man who is fitted to enter<br />\nthis calling could earn more<br />\nmoney in another. If his future<br />\nhappines depends upon his owning a motor car, and he cannot be<br />\nsatisfied with the admirable contrivance of Mr. Henry Ford, he<br />\nshould hesitate about becoming a<br />\nteacher. But there are other rewards for the teacher. \u2022 He has<br />\nwhat most men love, namely,<br />\npower. This is not power to boss<br />\nnumbers of men or to direct human action, but power over civilization, influence upon the facts of<br />\nfundamental significance in the<br />\nlife of man. From this point of<br />\nview the most powerful man of the<br />\nnineteenth century was Charles<br />\nDarwin.<br />\nAnother intrinsic reward for<br />\nthe university teacher is found in<br />\nlife in a university community.<br />\nNext to the church, the university<br />\nis the most venerable and dignified<br />\nof associations, and most men<br />\nvalue the opportunity to do their<br />\nlife's work under the conditions<br />\nwhich if offers.<br />\nA third recompense for the<br />\nscholar's labor is the fact that he<br />\nis in good company\u2014the best of<br />\nthe deads, in books, and successive generations of young men. By<br />\nthese latter he is kept young and<br />\nmade to look to the future rather<br />\nthan to the past. His function as<br />\na teacher enables him to influence<br />\npowerfully the leaders of the next<br />\ngeneration. Meanwhile he enjoys<br />\nthe exercise of his own powers,<br />\nand if he has chosen wisely, is repaid by the fun of his job.<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n.1)`j<br />\n\u2022 ;q1;eop<br />\n<br />\nMurads are Pure Turkish!<br />\n100%<br />\nBuy a package<br />\nof Murads.If you<br />\nare not more<br />\nthan satisfied,<br />\nreturn half the<br />\npackage to us<br />\nand get all your<br />\nmoney back.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022\\\u2018.0554<br />\n<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\nWe are not<br />\nafraid to make<br />\nthis offer \u2014<br />\nMURADS ARE<br />\nTURKISH \u2014the<br />\n<br />\nworld's most<br />\nfamous tobacco<br />\nfor cigarettes.<br />\n<br />\nJudge for<br />\nyourself\u2014!<br />\n<br />\nels_saY0<br />\ncfthi'aghat es.es Turkish<br />\nWits<br />\nCriptim Ugurettes An the Wcrld<br />\n<br />\nand<br />\n<br />\n0,1'41<br />\n<br />\nLECTURES ON AMERICAN ART<br />\n(Continuedfrom page .2)<br />\nmurals in Boston.

Hopkins made several good gains, getting three first downs in all; but<br />\nwhenever the team was within<br />\nstriking distance of the Navy goal<br />\nline a bad pass from the center<br />\nspoiled what looked several times<br />\nlike a touchdown. Captain Jones<br />\nwas injured in this game and did<br />\nnot regain his old-time form until<br />\nthe game with Western Maryland. Cashell was shifted back to<br />\nhis old position at full for a part<br />\nof the game, and Cromwell was<br />\ngiven a chance to show what he<br />\ncould do in center. His passing<br />\nwas no better than that displayed<br />\nby Cashell a week before against<br />\nMt. St. Mary's, and all loyal rooters were delighted to learn that<br />\n\"Stem\" Hecht, for two years AllMary land center, would return to<br />\nthe iiversity.<br />\nA week of good hard practice<br />\nfollowed, and in the third game of<br />\nthe season the fast Gallaudet<br />\neleven was defeated, 33 to 9, Hopkins coming from behind in the<br />\nlast quarter and scoring 27 points.<br />\nThis game was very encouraging<br />\nto all Hopkins supporters, and it<br />\nwas seen that the team was going<br />\nto have to be seriously considered<br />\nin the state championship race. A<br />\nreal punch was uncovered in this<br />\ngame, and the work of Cashell,<br />\nwho returned to center, was all<br />\nthat could be desired. In the<br />\nbackfield the work of Hoffman was<br />\nespecially good, while Tome, Bardiet and Watson left nothing to be<br />\ndesired. Jones played a beautiful<br />\ngame until he was knocked out in<br />\nthe second quarter. The team had<br />\nnow begun to show what it was<br />\nreally capable of, and visions of<br />\nthe state championship began to<br />\nappear in the distance.<br />\nThe next week the team journeyed to Swarthmore, where it<br />\nmet defeat at the hands of the fast<br />\neleven representing that institution by a 20-to-6 score. The game<br />\nwas played under the worst possible circumstances for the Hopkins eleven. The field was very<br />\nheavy and the backs were unable<br />\nto get foothold enough to start,<br />\nmany plays hardly reaching the<br />\nline of scrimmage before they were<br />\nstopped by the Swarthmore men,<br />\nwho were evidently used to playing on a field covered with three<br />\ninches of mud. Hecht played most<br />\nof the game at center, Cashell going back to his old position in the<br />\nbackfield. Hampered and seemingly rather discouraged by the<br />\nmud, Hopkins failed to show<br />\neither the team-work or the driVe<br />\nthat had characterized the play<br />\nagainst Gallaudet the week previous. Swarthmore had a fast,<br />\nheavy team, and every play was<br />\ncovered in perfect interference.<br />\n\u2022 Hopkins' one score came after a<br />\n<br />\npretty run of 65 yards by Barchet,<br />\nwho had intercepted a forward<br />\npass.<br />\nSeveral changes were made for<br />\nthe next gaine\u2014that with Lebanon<br />\nValley. Cashel' was again shifted<br />\nto center, and Calkins, who had<br />\nbeen end and general utility man,<br />\nwas shifted to fullback. Hopkins<br />\nagain showed a driving attack,<br />\nwith Calkins as the chief ground<br />\ngainer. The game ended with<br />\nHopkins a 20-to-6 victor. The work<br />\nof the line was especially good in<br />\nthis game, the plunging attack of<br />\nLebanon Valley being stopped by<br />\nthe excellent work of Ed Wood,<br />\nLandy and Egerton. Particularly<br />\npleasing to Hopkins was the unexpected ability displayed by Calkins, playing his first game in the<br />\nbackfield.<br />\nHopkins seemed rather overconfident, and the next week was defeated, 7 to 0, by Haverford in a<br />\nclose and exciting game. Hopkins<br />\nshould have been victor with comparative ease, but poor judgment<br />\non the part of the quarterback and<br />\nthe inexperience of Calkins, who<br />\nwas stuck in long enough to permit Haverford to put a forward<br />\npass over his head, proved a big<br />\nenough handicap to defeat the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Hopkins showed<br />\na powerful attack, but were unable to sustain it inside the 20yard line. Calkins was again the<br />\nbest bet in the Hopkins attack,<br />\nand Landy did excellent work in<br />\nthe line.<br />\nAfter d week of unusually hard<br />\npractice Western Maryland was<br />\nmet in the first of the three state<br />\ngames. The visitors were light and<br />\nabsolutely unable to stop Hopkins' hard-charging backs. Captain<br />\nJones showed a welcome return to<br />\nform in this game, running 70<br />\nyards for a touchdown on a play<br />\ninside tackle. The whole Hopkins<br />\nteam performed creditably, both<br />\nthe offense and the defense doing<br />\ntheir full share, the final count<br />\nbeing 30 to 6. Western Maryland<br />\nmanaged to get one touchdown on<br />\na beautiful forward pass to their<br />\nveteran captain, Langrall. The<br />\ngame was won without opening up<br />\nany of the new plays being saved<br />\nfor the games with St. Johns and<br />\nState.<br />\nThe next team on the schedule<br />\nwas St. John's, and in this game<br />\nHopkins seemed to be suffering a<br />\nbit from overconfidence, being<br />\nforced to the limit to hold the Soldiers to a 13-to-13 tie. Any one<br />\nwho saw the games with Western<br />\nMaryland and State knows how<br />\nmuch Hopkins was off.form on<br />\nthat day. Calkins and Jones<br />\nstarred on the offense and on the<br />\ndefense the tackling of Jones was<br />\nof the highest order. \"Bill\" Wood<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nwas injured comparatively early<br />\nin the game, and his loss was badly felt, St. John's making many<br />\ngains on end runs that Wood probably would have stopped.<br />\nIn the last game of the season,<br />\non Thanksgiving Day, the muchheralded team from Maryland<br />\nState was met, the team that had<br />\nheld West Virginia to 27 points<br />\nand Vale to 30, besides holding a<br />\nclear-cut victory over the University of Virginia. State won<br />\nthrough the virtue of superior<br />\nweight, being outfought by the<br />\nlighter Black and Blue team from<br />\nstart to finish. Calkins and Tome,<br />\nwhom Byrd himself characterized<br />\nin the Washington, Star as the two<br />\nbest backs in the state, were the<br />\nparticularly bright stars from the<br />\nHopkins viewpoint. Mackert was<br />\nReversable Leather Coats<br />\nthe chief performer for the College<br />\nNow 20% Off<br />\nPark team.

Altogether the<br />\nteam won four games, lost four<br />\nand tied one. The state championshop honors were again carried off<br />\nby Maryland State, which was<br />\nrepresented by one of the strongest<br />\nteams ever turned out at that institution. St. John's was tied in<br />\none of the closest games staged between_ the two colleges for a number of years. The new coaching<br />\nsystem, in full effect for the first<br />\ntime, proved to be a success, the<br />\nfull measure of which cannot be<br />\nfelt for a number of years. The<br />\nschedule was hard, and it was not<br />\npossible to have the hours for collegiate duties so arranged that the<br />\nteam could get all the real practice it should have had. It is to<br />\nbe hoped that in the future laboratories and afternoon classes can be<br />\nso arranged that the team will be<br />\nable to get in at least two hours of<br />\nreal practice each day. This has<br />\nhen done in Harvard, Yale and<br />\nothers of the large colleges. Students and faculty should be willing and glad to go out of their way<br />\nto promote better athletics at Hopkins.<br />\nIn the first game of the year Mt.<br />\nSt. Mary's was met and defeated,<br />\n13 to 6. The team had been on the<br />\nfield only a week or so, and a lack<br />\nof training was very evident. The<br />\nup-staters were light but fast, and<br />\nwhile in no danger of losing at<br />\nany time, Hopkins was forced to<br />\ndisplay its best to win. It became<br />\nevident that the team was especially in need of an experienced<br />\ncenter to make a good showing.<br />\nCashell had been moved from his<br />\nold position at fullback into that<br />\nplace, but his passing was badly<br />\noff color.

In the ''first half<br />\n-Coach Murphy, who did not wish<br />\nto take any chances with his firststring men, sent in the second and<br />\nthird teams, and the Navy managed to roll up 48 points.

Long<br />\nshots on the part of Weiner and<br />\nCuneo cropped out again, but<br />\nwithout suaess. Byerle was the<br />\nstar performer for the Annapolitans, seeming to be able to find the<br />\nbasket from any angle, dropping<br />\nin two goals by tossing the leather<br />\nover his shoulders.

He has not only brought the<br />\nbasketball team forth from its<br />\nsemi-obscurity, but has filled a<br />\nlong-felt need for something of a<br />\nsocial nature, not quite as elaborate as the cotillions and a little<br />\nmore intimate than the pure-andsimple athletic contests.

The existence of a student literary periodical would, moreover, rouse the<br />\nmembers of the English composition classes to more conscientious exertion; readable and interesting essays and stories would<br />\nbecome far more abundant in<br />\nthose masses of manuscript which<br />\nare weekly inflicted upon the English composition instructors, if<br />\nthe authors of these contributions but had the incentive of seeing their articles appear in print.<br />\nAnd if the stories printed in this<br />\nmagazine were respectably interesting and the essays moderately<br />\nentertaining there is no doubt<br />\n(Continued on page .5, col. 4)<br /><br />\nWell, examinations will soon be<br />\nhere and I hope that everybody<br />\nis perfectly satisfied with their<br />\nexam schedule; I did the best I<br />\n\u2022 could to arrange it so that no one<br />\ntook more than three exams a<br />\nday.

Lo.vejoy. As President<br />\nof the American Association of<br />\nUniversity Professors, Dr. Lovejoy is eminently qualified to discuss the teaching profession. Of<br />\nthe university teacher Ile said that<br />\nit should be clearly understood<br />\nthat a man who is fitted to enter<br />\nthis calling could earn more<br />\nmoney in another. If his future<br />\nhappines depends upon his owning a motor car, and he cannot be<br />\nsatisfied with the admirable contrivance of Mr. Henry Ford, he<br />\nshould hesitate about becoming a<br />\nteacher. But there are other rewards for the teacher. \u2022 He has<br />\nwhat most men love, namely,<br />\npower. This is not power to boss<br />\nnumbers of men or to direct human action, but power over civilization, influence upon the facts of<br />\nfundamental significance in the<br />\nlife of man.

By<br />\nthese latter he is kept young and<br />\nmade to look to the future rather<br />\nthan to the past. His function as<br />\na teacher enables him to influence<br />\npowerfully the leaders of the next<br />\ngeneration. Meanwhile he enjoys<br />\nthe exercise of his own powers,<br />\nand if he has chosen wisely, is repaid by the fun of his job.<br /><br />\ni<br />\n.1)`j<br />\n\u2022 ;q1;eop<br /><br />\nMurads are Pure Turkish!<br />\n100%<br />\nBuy a package<br />\nof Murads.If you<br />\nare not more<br />\nthan satisfied,<br />\nreturn half the<br />\npackage to us<br />\nand get all your<br />\nmoney back.<br /><br />\n\u2022 \u2022\\\u2018.0554<br /><br />\n:<br /><br />\nWe are not<br />\nafraid to make<br />\nthis offer \u2014<br />\nMURADS ARE<br />\nTURKISH \u2014the<br /><br />\nworld's most<br />\nfamous tobacco<br />\nfor cigarettes.<br /><br />\nJudge for<br />\nyourself\u2014!<br /><br />\nels_saY0<br />\ncfthi'aghat es.es Turkish<br />\nWits<br />\nCriptim Ugurettes An the Wcrld<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\n0,1'41<br /><br />\nLECTURES ON AMERICAN ART<br />\n(Continuedfrom page .2)<br />\nmurals in Boston.

Hopkins made several good gains, getting three first downs in all; but<br />\nwhenever the team was within<br />\nstriking distance of the Navy goal<br />\nline a bad pass from the center<br />\nspoiled what looked several times<br />\nlike a touchdown. Captain Jones<br />\nwas injured in this game and did<br />\nnot regain his old-time form until<br />\nthe game with Western Maryland. Cashell was shifted back to<br />\nhis old position at full for a part<br />\nof the game, and Cromwell was<br />\ngiven a chance to show what he<br />\ncould do in center. His passing<br />\nwas no better than that displayed<br />\nby Cashell a week before against<br />\nMt. St. Mary's, and all loyal rooters were delighted to learn that<br />\n\"Stem\" Hecht, for two years AllMary land center, would return to<br />\nthe iiversity.<br />\nA week of good hard practice<br />\nfollowed, and in the third game of<br />\nthe season the fast Gallaudet<br />\neleven was defeated, 33 to 9, Hopkins coming from behind in the<br />\nlast quarter and scoring 27 points.<br />\nThis game was very encouraging<br />\nto all Hopkins supporters, and it<br />\nwas seen that the team was going<br />\nto have to be seriously considered<br />\nin the state championship race. A<br />\nreal punch was uncovered in this<br />\ngame, and the work of Cashell,<br />\nwho returned to center, was all<br />\nthat could be desired. In the<br />\nbackfield the work of Hoffman was<br />\nespecially good, while Tome, Bardiet and Watson left nothing to be<br />\ndesired. Jones played a beautiful<br />\ngame until he was knocked out in<br />\nthe second quarter. The team had<br />\nnow begun to show what it was<br />\nreally capable of, and visions of<br />\nthe state championship began to<br />\nappear in the distance.<br />\nThe next week the team journeyed to Swarthmore, where it<br />\nmet defeat at the hands of the fast<br />\neleven representing that institution by a 20-to-6 score. The game<br />\nwas played under the worst possible circumstances for the Hopkins eleven. The field was very<br />\nheavy and the backs were unable<br />\nto get foothold enough to start,<br />\nmany plays hardly reaching the<br />\nline of scrimmage before they were<br />\nstopped by the Swarthmore men,<br />\nwho were evidently used to playing on a field covered with three<br />\ninches of mud. Hecht played most<br />\nof the game at center, Cashell going back to his old position in the<br />\nbackfield. Hampered and seemingly rather discouraged by the<br />\nmud, Hopkins failed to show<br />\neither the team-work or the driVe<br />\nthat had characterized the play<br />\nagainst Gallaudet the week previous. Swarthmore had a fast,<br />\nheavy team, and every play was<br />\ncovered in perfect interference.<br />\n\u2022 Hopkins' one score came after a<br /><br />\npretty run of 65 yards by Barchet,<br />\nwho had intercepted a forward<br />\npass.<br />\nSeveral changes were made for<br />\nthe next gaine\u2014that with Lebanon<br />\nValley. Cashel' was again shifted<br />\nto center, and Calkins, who had<br />\nbeen end and general utility man,<br />\nwas shifted to fullback. Hopkins<br />\nagain showed a driving attack,<br />\nwith Calkins as the chief ground<br />\ngainer. The game ended with<br />\nHopkins a 20-to-6 victor. The work<br />\nof the line was especially good in<br />\nthis game, the plunging attack of<br />\nLebanon Valley being stopped by<br />\nthe excellent work of Ed Wood,<br />\nLandy and Egerton. Particularly<br />\npleasing to Hopkins was the unexpected ability displayed by Calkins, playing his first game in the<br />\nbackfield.<br />\nHopkins seemed rather overconfident, and the next week was defeated, 7 to 0, by Haverford in a<br />\nclose and exciting game. Hopkins<br />\nshould have been victor with comparative ease, but poor judgment<br />\non the part of the quarterback and<br />\nthe inexperience of Calkins, who<br />\nwas stuck in long enough to permit Haverford to put a forward<br />\npass over his head, proved a big<br />\nenough handicap to defeat the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Hopkins showed<br />\na powerful attack, but were unable to sustain it inside the 20yard line. Calkins was again the<br />\nbest bet in the Hopkins attack,<br />\nand Landy did excellent work in<br />\nthe line.<br />\nAfter d week of unusually hard<br />\npractice Western Maryland was<br />\nmet in the first of the three state<br />\ngames. The visitors were light and<br />\nabsolutely unable to stop Hopkins' hard-charging backs. Captain<br />\nJones showed a welcome return to<br />\nform in this game, running 70<br />\nyards for a touchdown on a play<br />\ninside tackle. The whole Hopkins<br />\nteam performed creditably, both<br />\nthe offense and the defense doing<br />\ntheir full share, the final count<br />\nbeing 30 to 6. Western Maryland<br />\nmanaged to get one touchdown on<br />\na beautiful forward pass to their<br />\nveteran captain, Langrall. The<br />\ngame was won without opening up<br />\nany of the new plays being saved<br />\nfor the games with St. Johns and<br />\nState.<br />\nThe next team on the schedule<br />\nwas St. John's, and in this game<br />\nHopkins seemed to be suffering a<br />\nbit from overconfidence, being<br />\nforced to the limit to hold the Soldiers to a 13-to-13 tie. Any one<br />\nwho saw the games with Western<br />\nMaryland and State knows how<br />\nmuch Hopkins was off.form on<br />\nthat day. Calkins and Jones<br />\nstarred on the offense and on the<br />\ndefense the tackling of Jones was<br />\nof the highest order. \"Bill\" Wood<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nwas injured comparatively early<br />\nin the game, and his loss was badly felt, St. John's making many<br />\ngains on end runs that Wood probably would have stopped.<br />\nIn the last game of the season,<br />\non Thanksgiving Day, the muchheralded team from Maryland<br />\nState was met, the team that had<br />\nheld West Virginia to 27 points<br />\nand Vale to 30, besides holding a<br />\nclear-cut victory over the University of Virginia. State won<br />\nthrough the virtue of superior<br />\nweight, being outfought by the<br />\nlighter Black and Blue team from<br />\nstart to finish. Calkins and Tome,<br />\nwhom Byrd himself characterized<br />\nin the Washington, Star as the two<br />\nbest backs in the state, were the<br />\nparticularly bright stars from the<br />\nHopkins viewpoint.
