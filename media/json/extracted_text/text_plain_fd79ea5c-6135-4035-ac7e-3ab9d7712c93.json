He noted that<br />\nthe existence even of political<br />\nrefugees points to the shortcomings of Egyptian society, where<br />\n\"everyone was supposed to be so<br />\nhappy.\" Ammunenshi thus<br />\nreceives Sinuhe at his court with<br />\na \"superior detachment vis-a-vis<br />\nEgyptian society.\"<br />\nIn the tale of the Prince of<br />\nNaharain, according to Loprieno,<br />\nan Egyptian wins the hand of the<br />\nprince's daughter in competition.<br />\nAlthough initially reluctant to accept an Egyptian as his son-inlaw, the Prince of Naharain<br />\n\"realizes he is a fine fellow,\"<br />\nLoprieno highlighted the unusual<br />\nwarmth with which the prince<br />\nwelcomes the Egyptian into his<br />\nfamily.<br />\nLoprieno concluded by noting<br />\nthat the literary periods of Egypt<br />\ncoincide with the periods of most<br />\nintense contact with foreign countries, particularly with Asia. In<br />\nhis opinion, the intellectual class<br />\nemancipate<br />\n\"to<br />\nwanted<br />\nthemselves literarily\" and free<br />\nthemselves from the strictures of<br />\ntheological and governmental<br />\ndogma.

She offered their<br />\npoetry as expressions of love, expressions that, if sought out and<br />\nappreciated, have much to teach<br />\nall people, young and old, in<br />\nsociety today. Her readings of<br />\nsuch poets as Georgia Douglas<br />\nJohnson, Nikki Giovanni, and<br />\nPaul Laurence Dunbar were lively and entertaining and they all<br />\nused \"intelligence to get their<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\n<br />\nMaya Angelou was the last<br />\nspeaker in the 1990 Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium.<br />\nof access and responsibility in<br />\neducation. Angelou urged the audience to \"go to the library\" and<br />\nexplore the poetry and literature<br />\nof various cultures. She situated<br />\nthe final responsibility for education squarely upon the shoulders<br />\nof the individual. \"Let the library<br />\neducate you,\" she said.<br />\nAngelou reminded students that<br />\nwhen the resources are available,<br />\nas they certainly are for a student<br />\nat an institution like Johns<br />\nHopkins, the student must make<br />\nher own education a reality for<br />\nherself. \"A good student can<br />\nmake a mediocre teacher great.\"<br />\nAngelou's conclusion was no<br />\nless dramatic than the rest of her<br />\nlecture.

There<br />\nwas no mail for Miranda in the<br />\nmailbox.<br />\nIt took four days for a letter to<br />\ncross America from east coast to<br />\nwest. Ten days ago she had sent<br />\nher letter to David. Here it was,<br />\nFebruary 14th, the day that out<br />\nof any she should get a letter from<br />\nher boyfriend, and the only valentines in the mailbox were for<br />\nDoris. Seven valentines for<br />\nDoris. Miranda didn't think that<br />\nDoris knew seven people.<br />\nUnderneath the valentines was a<br />\ncopy of Zack's Writer's Digest<br />\nmagazine.<br />\nMiranda wondered for a moment why Zack's mail was coming to their apartment, but then<br />\nrealized that it was probably the<br />\nonly way he would ever get his<br />\nmail.<br />\nOn the way to campus, Miranda counted seven couples holding<br />\nhands. Three of them kissed in<br />\npublic. One couple was dressed<br />\nalike in red and black. Miranda<br />\ndidn't even know what David was<br />\nwearing. She checked her watch.<br />\n11:32 a.m. Okay, she did know<br />\nwhat David was wearing, three<br />\ntime zones away: nothing.<br />\nSomehow that didn't make<br />\nMiranda feel better.<br />\nOn campus, she headed to the<br />\npost office to mail off David's<br />\nwhy-didn't-I-get-a-letter-fromyou letter. In front of the building<br />\nwas a flower salesman. He smiled at her, and she wondered what<br />\nshe could do with those flowers<br />\nto cause the most amount of<br />\nphysical pain.<br />\nCircle K had set up a booth outside of the post office selling candy packages. Miranda somehow<br />\ncouldn't imagine anyone she<br />\nknew falling for this shameless<br />\ndisplay of capitalism. Then she<br />\nthought again, as Zack was at the<br />\nbooth buying an extra-large Luv-<br />\n<br />\nBasket.<br />\n\"Zack, you aren't getting that<br />\nfor Carol, are you?\"<br />\n\"Huh? Oh, hi, Miranda!\"<br />\n\"Hi.\"<br />\n\"No, I think I'm pretty much<br />\nover Carol. I mean, it's been<br />\nwhat? Six months? Two years? I<br />\ncan't remember.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, neither could she,\"<br />\nMiranda added. \"What did it take<br />\n<br />\nWhile bemoaning her lack<br />\nof valentines, Miranda<br />\nsaw Zack at the Circle K<br />\nbooth buying an extralarge Luv-Basket<br />\nher? Six minutes? Two hours?\"<br />\nZack blanched a bit and Miranda felt sorry.<br />\n\"Well, I'm over her,\" Zack<br />\nsaid with what conviction he<br />\ncould muster.<br />\n\"Well you're not getting them<br />\nfor me, are you?\" Miranda asked disdainfully, hoping he was.<br />\n\"No,\" he said, confirming to<br />\nMiranda that this was a bad day.<br />\n\"I'm going out with someone<br />\nnow.\"<br />\nThe world was changing,<br />\nMiranda thought. Zack had taken<br />\nto being single so well she<br />\nthought that he was supposed to<br />\nbe that way. Of course, she had<br />\nkind of taken to being in a relationship, and look what kind of<br />\nValentine's Day she had.<br />\n\"Who is it?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"And will you be sleeping on her<br />\ncouch from now on?\"<br />\n\"Her name's Kirsten, and no,<br />\nher roommate doesn't like me<br />\nthat much. I'll probably still stay<br />\non yours.\"<br />\n\"My pleasure is boundless,<br />\nZack.\"<br />\n\"Hey, did you see the latest<br />\nnewspaper?\" Zack asked.<br />\n\"Aside from doing the `Rachelle<br />\nContinued on page 5<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nWas Leadership the Problem All Along?<br />\nIn the aftermath of the rape on campus last Saturday night, many<br />\nare besieged by feelings of vulnerability, helplessness, frustration,<br />\nand rage. There are no remedies and few satisfying outlets for these<br />\nfeelings\u2014what, really, can we do?<br />\nPreventive measures, too late, are reemphasized, and questions<br />\nof risk, responsibility, and blame materialize soon after. One point<br />\nthat evaporates in the urgency of the moment is that we all take risks,<br />\nto varying degrees, every day. Crime is pervasive and tenacious;<br />\nit will always find a victim.<br />\nThough the issue of campus security is dwarfed by the ramifications of rape, this crime prompts the News-Letter once again to hold<br />\nHomewood Security up to the performance yardstick. It is unfair to<br />\npoint an accusing finger at Security each time a crime is committed<br />\non campus or against a student; nonetheless, it is important to ask<br />\nquestions after a tragedy occurs.<br />\nTellingly, the questions that come to mind have been asked many<br />\ntimes before, and as recently as last semester. What is the role of<br />\nHomewood Security? Realistically, what can they be expected to offer<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community, given some apparently inherent<br />\nlimitations? How can the current organization best serve the needs<br />\nof this community?<br />\nLast semester Security took one or two preliminary steps toward<br />\nresponding to these questions. Unfortunately, what little progress it<br />\nmight have made has since been undermined by an attitude, evident<br />\nwithin Security itself, that stands in apparent opposition to that<br />\norganization's stated goals.<br />\nThis attitude is perhaps most evident\u2014and most offensive\u2014in the<br />\ninadequate, inaccurate, and suspiciously tardy Security Bulletin informing the campus of Saturday's incident. One thing that Security<br />\ncan do\u2014without pleading lack of manpower, lack of jurisdiction,<br />\nor lack of responsibility\u2014is dispense crucial information that affects<br />\nthe immediate safety of the Homewood community. The Security<br />\nBulletin should have been distributed all over campus and in<br />\neveryone's mailbox by Monday morning. It should have more accurately explained the incident (the victim was abducted from the<br />\nstreet, not attacked in the woods). It should have included more comprehensive prevention information, as well as details regarding specific<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Security services.<br />\nThe Community Crime Report, or rather its conspicuous absence<br />\nin the News-Letter this semester, is another example of a service that<br />\nSecurity can and should be performing but somehow manages to \"put<br />\noff\" until it becomes convenient to do so. The Report came into being last semester in response to an obvious need and with the labor<br />\nof a few dedicated individuals. But understanding the importance of<br />\nthis endeavor\u2014not to mention its support in the community\u2014did not<br />\nextend high enough into the echelons of power and authority. As a<br />\nresult, the Community Crime Report tumbled into someone's indefinite \"in\" box.<br />\nThe Crime Report and Security Bulletins are two concrete, wholly reasonable tasks for Homewood Security that it currently can't<br />\nseem to handle. Yet these two examples reflect not only two specific<br />\nand resolvable problems but a disturbing attitude as well\u2014an attitude<br />\nthat endangers this campus and that so far has been immutable in<br />\nthe face of initiative from within and without.<br />\nPerhaps it was this same attitude that turned last semester's peaceful<br />\ndemonstration addressing the ROTC question into a potentially,<br />\nthough unnecessarily, dangerous situation. A form of expression<br />\nunusual for Homewood\u2014active protest\u2014was employed, and volatile<br />\nissues were addressed, but the only individuals who appeared to feel<br />\ngravely and immediately threatened (and who exhibited dangerous<br />\nbehavior) were the officers of Homewood Security. They exhibited<br />\na profound lack of understanding for the situation. Rooted in this<br />\nlack of understanding was an attitude that planted, then heightened,<br />\na sense of impending threat. This gave birth to ideas of force, then<br />\nan ethic of 'Security versus the students,' and ultimately, action<br />\nwithout thought.<br />\nAttitude is a slippery notion, difficult to pin down. But it is connected in important ways to inter-relating, communicating, and performing a job effectively. Attitude comes from the top. The leader<br />\nof any organization sets a tone in both word and action\u2014in actions<br />\ndone and not done\u2014that ultimately shapes that organization.<br />\nHomewood Security needs a leader who can set that tone, maintain<br />\nit, and rebuild that organization.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nChecking into the IBM-Hopkins-South Africa Triangle;<br />\n(In)actions and Stereotypes; A Reporter Responds<br />\nTo theeditors:<br />\nFive hundred and forty three IBM<br />\nemployees, including myself, have<br />\nsubmitted a stockholder resolution<br />\ncalling on IBM to end sales to South<br />\nAfrica, Harold Brown, Chairman of<br />\nthe Foreign Policy Institute of Johns<br />\nHopkins University, is one of the<br />\neighteen people to whom our campaign is directed since he is a<br />\nmember of the IBM board of<br />\ndirectors\u2014for which service<br />\nreceives about $60,000 from IBM.<br />\nFor two years IBM has refused to<br />\nconfirm or deny reports in South<br />\nAfrican publications that it sells to<br />\nmilitary contractors in South Africa.<br />\nIn his role as an independent<br />\nacademic official, I would encourage<br />\nMr. Brown to investigate and present the truth.<br />\nThe issue of supplying military<br />\ncontractors in South Africa is important because the white minority<br />\nmaintains rule not by the free choice<br />\nof South African citizens, but by<br />\nforce and violence. Apartheid is still<br />\nin place: despite recent announcements, blacks are still excluded from the vote; race is still the<br />\nlegal basis for political, social,<br />\neducational, and<br />\neconomic<br />\ndiscrimination; over three thousand<br />\npolitical prisoners remain behind<br />\nbars; and twenty thousand remain in<br />\nexile. And government death squads<br />\nand vigilantes continue to terrorize.<br />\nIBM has supplied South Africa<br />\nwith more mainframe computers<br />\nthan any other company. IBM has<br />\nacknowledged that nearly all its<br />\ncustomers in South Africa are<br />\nmembers of the white minority; thus,<br />\nits computers are used almost ex'elusively to bolster white power.<br />\nIBM has also acknowledged that the<br />\ncomputers IBM ships permit South<br />\nAfrica to maintain a strong<br />\neconomy, competitive with that of<br />\nother industrialized nations (1990<br />\nIBM proxy). Thus, IBM helps South<br />\nAfrica overcome the sanctions imposed by the world community.<br />\nIn view of South Africa's strategy<br />\nof fomenting violence and military<br />\naggression, and in view of its determination to develop nuclear<br />\nweapons, I am deeply concerned<br />\nabout the fact that IBM is listed as<br />\nhaving shipped mainframe computers to major South African<br />\nmilitary contractors, including<br />\nGrinaker Electronics, Plessy, Dorbyl, and Phillips (\"Computer Users<br />\nHandbook\", South Africa, 1987.<br />\nSouth Africa prohibited later editions<br />\nof this handbook). I am equally concerned that IBM supplied computers<br />\nto run production at two South<br />\nAfrican oil refineries that supply fuel<br />\nfor military vehicles (\"Computer<br />\nMail\", South Africa, 6-25-86 and<br />\n6-26-87).<br />\nIf IBM does engage in such sales,<br />\nI believe that Mr. Brown's saying so<br />\nwould make this sales program<br />\n<br />\nuntenable. Since high-technology<br />\nproducts such as mainframe computers are among the few major<br />\nitems that South Africa must import,<br />\nhalting these IBM shipments would<br />\nadd to the pressure for genuine<br />\nchange in South Africa,<br />\nI hope Mr. Brown will report the<br />\nfacts about IBM sales to South<br />\nAfrica military contractors. Because<br />\nSouth Africa has not halted its<br />\nviolence, there is no time to lose.<br />\nJames Leas<br />\nStaff Engineer for IBM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing in response to last<br />\nweek's letter by Greg Gagnon and<br />\nManuel P. Micaller, Jr. concerning<br />\ntheir fraternity's innocence in \"promot[ing] and perpetuat[ing] sexism,...and misogyny\": \"Kappa<br />\nSigma Fraternity is not, nor has ever<br />\nbeen guilty of these.\" I strongly<br />\nagree with the authors that Greeks<br />\ndo not \"band together\" in order to<br />\npromote such ideas, but seemingly<br />\nharmless actions can often inadvertently reinforce negative<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nDuring Fraternity Rush, I<br />\nreceived a flyer publicizing a Kappa Sigma function.

Perlstein<br />\nr;<br />\n,To the Editors:<br />\ns*Zook.,<br />\nLast week I was severely misquoted by News-Letter staff writer<br />\nHarry Milling in his article regarding<br />\nRogers House.<br />\nIn the article, Mr. Milling<br />\nreported that I had said administrators \"expressed concern that<br />\na fraternity's occupation of Rogers<br />\nHouse may not 'run as smoothly' as<br />\na sorority's occupation might.\"<br />\nBy quoting me in this manner, Mr.<br />\nMilling inferred that administrators<br />\nfelt that fraternities would not adhere<br />\nto University regulations, and that is<br />\nsimply not the case. As I expressed<br />\nto Mr. Milling on at least three<br />\noccasions, the general consent in the<br />\nHomewood Schools Services Advisory Committee is that it would be<br />\ntragic to deny fraternities housing<br />\nbecause of preconceived notions<br />\nabout their conduct. In the meeting,<br />\nDean Colombo clearly stated that he<br />\nrefused to discriminate against<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nI caution both the Mr. Milling and<br />\nthe News-Letter against misquoting<br />\ninterviewees in order to add validity to a specific writer's opinion. As<br />\njournalists, it is your responsibility<br />\nto present the facts and allow your<br />\nreaders to formulate opinions of their<br />\nown.<br />\nCraig M. Freeman<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn a letter published in last week's<br />\nedition of the News-Letter, Mary<br />\nShaffer accuses my article \"Hopkins<br />\nStudents, Alums in the Gulf\" of<br />\n\"imitat(ing) the very worst of the<br />\nmass media in its coverage of the<br />\nwar.\"<br />\nLike Ms. Shaffer, I was' in<br />\nWashington, D.C. for the<br />\ndemonstration on January 19th,<br />\nalthough not the 26th. While in<br />\nLafayette Square, I was struck not<br />\nonly by the sheer number of<br />\ndemonstrators, but also by the array<br />\nof political beliefs being so adamantly expressed in one small space.

We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br />\n<br />\nseems to me that the very essence of<br />\nthe demonstration was to be found<br />\nin this ideological diversity, since<br />\nclearly our involvement in the Midhas<br />\npolitically<br />\ndle<br />\nEast<br />\ndivided the nation to an extent which<br />\nmost individuals of student age have<br />\nnever before witnessed.<br />\nIn my second sentence, the one so<br />\nheavily criticized by Ms. Shaffer, I<br />\nstate simply \"Thousands of<br />\ndemonstrators both supporting and<br />\nopposing U.S. intervention in the<br />\nMiddle East have congregated in<br />\nWashington, D.C. during the past<br />\ntwo weeks. . .\" without quantification of one or the other. Certainly<br />\nthose opposing the war outnumbered<br />\nthose supporting it at the demonstration; in retrospect, the order of the<br />\ntwo critical terms ought to have been<br />\nreversed and this was an oversight<br />\non my part. However, Ms. Shaffer<br />\nasks for \"objective truth,\" and this<br />\ntruth is quite simply that representatives of both sides were present at<br />\nthese two demonstrations, and continue to make their respective community and even national headlines<br />\nas examples of a divided American<br />\npeople.<br />\nFinally, Ms. Shaffer accuses<br />\nmyself and the entire News-Letter<br />\nstaff of taking a stand on the war<br />\nunder the guise ofjournalistic objectivity. As a staff writer, I would certainly not presume to speak on behalf<br />\nof any other member of the NewsLetter. Furthermore, my own personal politics, especially as<br />\nmisconstrued by Ms. Shaffer, are in<br />\nno way reflected in my article.<br />\nI apologize to Ms. Shaffer and any<br />\nother readers who were offended by<br />\nmy reference to the demonstration.<br />\nHowever, since I made neither a<br />\nquantitative nor qualitative statement, and instead only briefly<br />\nestablished a backdrop for the focus<br />\nof my article, her criticisms seem<br />\nunfair, and her conclusions<br />\nunfounded.<br />\nKathleen Curry<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was disheartened by the rude<br />\ncomments the editors made in<br />\nresponse to a letter from Mary Shaffer. It is not a sin to mistake the title<br />\nof the publication. There was no<br />\nneed to ridicule her. Your sarcasm<br />\nwas uncalled for. Her letter made it<br />\nquite clear that she was very familiar<br />\nwith the article to which she<br />\nreferred and that is what is important. I know it is hard to take<br />\ncriticism after all the hard work yotr<br />\nput into the paper. But, your<br />\nresponse was unprofessional. Making cutting remarks and not responding to the issue in question is<br />\nchildish. I know it seems \"cooler\"<br />\nto put people down than to allow<br />\nthem to criticize your work.

While<br />\ntrying to suspend a pair of his<br />\nunderwear from the North Chiller<br />\nTower, he suddenly realized that<br />\nhe was incredibly drunk and very<br />\nmuch afraid of heights. As he<br />\nstruggled to regain his balance in<br />\nthe brutal wind, the poor fellow<br />\nwas struck by lightning and fell<br />\nmore than a hundred feet down<br />\nto a dumpster full of recycled<br />\nthumbtacks. Miraculously, he<br />\nsurvived, and when I dropped by<br />\nto see him, he had recovered<br />\nenough strength to sit up in traction and watch TV. I was surprised to see that he was watching a<br />\nvideotape of himself stumbling<br />\nand then falling from the tower.<br />\n\"Oh, Bob happened to have a<br />\nvideo camera when I went up,\"<br />\nhe explained. \"We're sending the<br />\ntape to 'America's Funniest<br />\nHome Videos.'\"<br />\nHe seemed to be healing well.<br />\nThen I noticed the glow in his<br />\neyes.<br />\n\"I was meant to survive.\" His<br />\nvoice was stretched tight by his<br />\nurgent fanaticism. \"You know<br />\nwhy, don't you?\"<br />\nWhen he saw the puzzled look<br />\non my face, he gestured me<br />\nnearer, and said in an almost<br />\necstatic whisper, \"I'm politically correct.\"<br />\nI was shocked.

Based on the bestselling novel by Thomas Harris\u2014and<br />\nhewing to its text as closely as any<br />\nfilm in recent memory\u2014it is<br />\nthoroughly engaging and<br />\nultimately suspenseful, but one<br />\nwould be hard-pressed to describe<br />\nthe sensation as thrilling.<br />\nFor The Silence of the Lambs<br />\nis, at its core, so completely<br />\nrepugnant that the evil unfolding<br />\nbefore Demme's unrelenting<br />\ncameras simply doesn't register.<br />\nThe brain shuts off, skirting<br />\naround horrors that the mind tries<br />\nto imagine, but that are ultimately inconceivable.<br />\nJodie Foster stars as FBI<br />\ntrainee Clarice Starling, called in<br />\nby Behavioral Science Unit Chief<br />\nJack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to<br />\naid in the capture of \"Buffalo<br />\nBill.\" Buffalo Bill is a serial<br />\nkiller, preying upon young<br />\nwomen by keeping them<br />\nprisoner, skinning them and<br />\ndumping them in rivers across the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nStarling is a novice, and<br />\nCrawford's attachment to her and<br />\nefforts to groom her career are<br />\nexplained only in the simplest<br />\nterms. Many elements of the<br />\noriginal plot by Harris are<br />\nstreamlined in the film; screenwriter Ted Tally wisely removes<br />\n<br />\na few of the novel's more<br />\nmarginal subplots, and the narrative advances without unnecessary distraction.<br />\nStarling's glaring femininity in<br />\nwhat is mostly a man's world occasionally bubbles to the surface;<br />\nshe is the only female in the<br />\nBureau elevator; the male cadets<br />\ngawk at her as she jogs by; she<br />\nneeds a man's help to open a<br />\ngarage door. Starling is conscious<br />\nof her sex, but turns it into an advantage frequently enough to defy<br />\nfrail stereotypes.<br />\nBut these overt victories belie<br />\ndeeper insecurities, and her<br />\nweaknesses as a woman and a<br />\nperson are brutally dissected by<br />\nDr. Hannibal \"The Cannibal\"<br />\nLecter (Anthony Hopkins), a<br />\nbrilliant and deceptively vicious<br />\npsychiatrist turned psychopath.<br />\nStarling's first task is to interview<br />\nLecter from his isolation cell,<br />\ndeep in the bowels of a Baltimore<br />\nhospital.<br />\nAged but physically robust,<br />\nLecter was released from his cell<br />\nonce for a checkup, but bit the<br />\nface off a nurse, his pulse never<br />\nrising above 85 even as he ate her<br />\ntongue. These are the kind of<br />\nmind-numbing atrocities that<br />\npermeate The Silence of the<br />\nLambs: no killing is too<br />\nrepulsive, no idea too distasteful<br />\nfor thorough investigation by the<br />\nnarrative.<br />\nLecter's understanding of the<br />\n<br />\npsychopathic mind is a two-edged<br />\nsword; Lecter gives information<br />\nonly when he receives some of<br />\nhis own. \"Quid pro quo,\" he<br />\ncalls it, but it is far more than<br />\nthat. Lecter thrives on discovering the secret fears of others,<br />\nstripping away layers of defenses<br />\nwith a mind-reader's glee. In his<br />\nbattle with the outside world, it's<br />\nhis most effective weapon. In a<br />\nlocked room, it's his only one.<br />\nStarling's first meeting with<br />\nLecter, in which their curious<br />\nrelationship of mutual need is<br />\nestablished, begins with a gesture<br />\nthat speaks volumes. Lecter asks<br />\nto see Starling's credentials, and<br />\nshe holds them up. \"Closer,\" he<br />\nsays, and Starling extends her<br />\narm, the rest of her body motionless. She believes every story<br />\nshe's heard about him, and this<br />\nknowledge controls her actions<br />\ndown to the last.<br />\nIt's a perfectly staged scene that<br />\nshould have great impact, but<br />\nthings seem deliberately out of<br />\nsync. After all we've heard about<br />\nLecter, the real thing is creepy<br />\nenough, but anti-climactic.<br />\nDemme shoots Starling and<br />\nLecter in tight, thoughtful closeups, but all that initially comes<br />\nacross is that nothing comes<br />\nacross.<br />\nBuffalo Bill's latest victim happens to be the daughter of a prominent Senator, and as the killer<br />\ngoes to work on a gruesome pro-<br />\n<br />\nject, Lecter negotiates a transfer.<br />\nStarling closes in on Buffalo<br />\nBill's location, and her meetings<br />\nwith Lecter intensify, leading to<br />\nconfrontations with both killers:<br />\none physical, the other mental,<br />\nand both absolutely riveting.<br />\nThe storytelling starts<br />\nawkwardly, but The Silence ofthe<br />\nLambs succeeds because the horror is cumulative, not incremental. The mystery unfolds gradually, as Lecter offers clues and<br />\nothers are discovered. By the<br />\nfilm's end, we know more than<br />\nwe ever wanted to.<br />\nAs Starling, Foster's soft<br />\nfeatures hide a willful persistence,<br />\na determination to separate the<br />\nmysteries of the case from the<br />\nmysteries of her past unearthed<br />\nby Lecter. The lines blur frequently, much as Starling resists<br />\nit, and Foster masters the script<br />\nwith physical and psychological<br />\nprowess, most notably in a final,<br />\nexcruciatingly tense scene in Buffalo Bill's lair.<br />\nHopkins plays Lecter almost<br />\ntoo well. Bolstered by moody<br />\nlighting, he brings an otherworldly grace to the character, making<br />\nhis flashes of violence all the<br />\nmore chilling. Lecter acts like<br />\nhalf the people walking around<br />\nBaltimore\u2014chew on that for a<br />\nwhile. In any case, it's a terrific<br />\nperformance\u201e.i.<br />\nDemme deserves much of the<br />\ncredit for pulling everything off.<br />\n<br />\nTwo FBI agents (Scott Glenn, left; and Jodie Foster, right) hunt down<br />\na crazed psychiatrist(Anthony Hopkins, middle)in Jonathan Demme's<br />\nSilence Of The Lambs.<br />\nBest known for -Urban romps anreal becomes real, at least as<br />\nMarried to the Mob and<br />\nlong as the mind permits it.<br />\nSomething Wild Demme directs<br />\nFor in its triumph, The Silence<br />\nwith energy and directness, ofthe Lambs negates all that it so<br />\nreminiscent of David Lynch but masterfully achieves. The film<br />\nwith none of the pretension.<br />\nhooks us all, impossible to watch<br />\nThe Lecters and Buffalo Bills but more impossible not to.

Four Jays<br />\nscored in double-figures, led by<br />\nthe 16 point charge of senior cocaptain Juliane Rolapp.<br />\nSophomore Sylke Knuppel,<br />\nmaking her return from an ankle<br />\ninjury which has sidelined her for<br />\nthe most part of the last few<br />\ngames, scored 14 points on 6-of-9<br />\nshooting from the field. Senior<br />\npost player Jennifer Luzietti turned in another solid effort for the<br />\nJays, netting 12 points, 5 steals,<br />\nand grabbing 11 rebounds. Senior<br />\nco-captain Kristie Kantowski also<br />\ncontributed 10 points and 9<br />\nboards.<br />\nThe Jays took a 38-27 lead into the locker room at halftime,<br />\nand despite being outscored in a<br />\nlackluster second half, they<br />\nmanaged to hang on for the win.<br />\nChicago shooters were frigid,<br />\nhitting only 35 percent of their<br />\nshots for the game, while the Jays<br />\nhit their season average of 46 percent from the field. Chicago.<br />\nmanaged to make 7-of-14 threepoint attempts, but that wasn't<br />\nenough as Hopkins punished<br />\nthem under the boards, outrebounding Chicago 43-32.

Hopkins outskateci, outshot, and outhit the Greyhounds<br />\nbn their way to a satisfying 4-3<br />\nvictory before a raucous crowd.<br />\nThe Blue Jays improved their<br />\nrecord to 8-4-2, moving them into<br />\na tie for second place in the<br />\nMason-Dixon league behind<br />\nTowson State.<br />\nHopkins did not capitalize on<br />\nearly power play opportunities,<br />\nbut did capitalize on strong-play<br />\nin the corners by assistant captain<br />\nDave Boxenbaum and Pat<br />\nChaisson, Chaisson used his<br />\nsuperior skating ability to outwork the covering Hound<br />\ndefenders and centered a pass that<br />\nwas deflected into the corner.<br />\nBoxenbaum, playing his second<br />\nconsecutive games without a<br />\npenalty, retrieved the puck in the<br />\ncorner and fed freshman John<br />\nTymkewitz in the slot.<br />\nTyrnkewitz converted the pass into a goal at 9:30 of the first period<br />\ngiving the Jays an early lead.<br />\nThree minutes later the same<br />\nthree players registered points as<br />\nChaisson once again stick handled through the Greyhound<br />\ndefense and ripped a shot over the<br />\ngoalie's glove from the right cir:le. After failing to convert on<br />\nanother power play the Jays looked as though they would end the<br />\nperiod with at 2-0 lead. Loyola<br />\nrelentlessly pounded away at a rebound and eventually snuck it<br />\npast Blue Jay goalie Pierre<br />\nChevray at 1:11 of the first. The<br />\nperiod ended with Loyola working a power play, but the score<br />\nremained 2-1 Hopkins.<br />\nLoyola tied the game with a<br />\nsharp angle wrist shot that<br />\nmanaged to sneak between<br />\nChevray's pads at 13:34 for<br />\nanother even strength goal.<br />\nHowever, Chevray came up big<br />\nover the next few minutes saving<br />\nthe Jays after successive miscues.<br />\nA two-on-one that nearly<br />\ndeveloped into a three-on-one<br />\nwas thwarted by a sparkling save.<br />\nChevray outdid himself when a<br />\nHopkins miscommunication at<br />\nthe blue line gave the shorthanded Greyhounds a one-on-none<br />\nDpportunity.<br />\nThe Jays dominated the rest of<br />\nContinued on page 19<br />\n<br />\nrecord to 12-9.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Jays didn't<br />\nhave as easy a time with UAA foe<br />\nWashington University, who<br />\nwere 18-4 and ranked fourth in<br />\nthe nation going into last Sunday's contest.

Wash. if. shot 56 percent<br />\nfor the garne,While Hopkins shot<br />\nonly 37 percent.<br />\nWash. U. took advantage of<br />\ntheir superior size and depth in<br />\nthe second half. The Jays were<br />\noutrebounded 42-28, eeking out<br />\na paltry 6 offensive rebounds for<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe Jays fared better in their<br />\nfinal regular season game against<br />\nMAC opponent Dickinson last<br />\nTuesday, rolling to a lopsided<br />\n73-47 victory. The Jays played<br />\nwithout Luzietti, who was out<br />\nwith the flu.<br />\nKantowski poured in 20 points<br />\nin addition to grabbing 10 rebounds to lead the Jays.

The charitable Dickinson<br />\nsquad helped Hopkins by giving<br />\naway a generous 29 turnovers.<br />\nThe win over Dickinson gives<br />\nthe Jays a final regular season<br />\nrecord of 17-6(8-2 in the MAC).<br />\nThe victory assures Hopkins of a<br />\nsecond place finish in the MAC<br />\nSouthwest and an automatic berth<br />\nin the MAC tournament.

Scott Huber's pin in the final bout gave the Jays<br />\na one-point victory.<br />\n<br />\nWrestling Attempts to<br />\nRegroup After Injuries<br />\nby Mike Ricci<br />\nThe young Hopkins wrestling<br />\nteam has been on a roller-coaster<br />\nride this season. Hit hard by injuries and early retirements, the<br />\nteam has been forced to find new<br />\ncontributors to fill the gaps.<br />\nOn a recent road trip, the team<br />\nlost a heartbreaker to a veteran<br />\nMuhlenberg squad, only to<br />\nbounce back later that day to handily defeat Albright. In the match<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg the Blue Jays<br />\nwon five of the ten matches but<br />\nlost on points. Captain Gary<br />\nHsich at 118 lbs., Tony<br />\nGagliostro at 126 lbs., and Scott<br />\nDrewes at 142 lbs. all won close<br />\ndecisions, while sophomore<br />\nMichael Ricci at 167 lbs.<br />\nregistered a pin. At 190 lbs., captain Scott Huber, avenged an<br />\nearlier loss using his aggressive<br />\nstyle to devastate his opponent.<br />\nAfter the match, Huber's opponent had to be helped from the<br />\nmat.<br />\nAgainst Albright the team looked much sharper. Jake Manella<br />\n(118 lbs.) started the team off in<br />\nthe right direction with a pin.<br />\nFreshmen Rob Restuccia (126<br />\nlbs.) and Danny Abdi(134 lbs.)<br />\ncontinued the onslaught with hard<br />\nfought victories. Sam Baldwin<br />\n(158 lbs.) also posted an impressive victory. Ricci earned his<br />\nsecond win of the day with a 16-0<br />\ndecision. Another double winner<br />\nwas Huber. Heavyweight Kadir<br />\nErkman ended the meet with a<br />\nmajor decision.,<br />\nLast Wednesday the Jays faced Western Maryland at home.<br />\nAfter a grueling match the Jays<br />\ncame up a little short losing<br />\n26-28. Hsich once again started<br />\nthe team with a win. Peter Tucci<br />\n(126 lbs.) followed with the<br />\nquickest pin of the season,just 12<br />\nseconds. Danny Organek's (134<br />\nlbs.) match showed the dedication<br />\nthis team has. He broke a finger<br />\nin the first period, yet not only<br />\nfinished the match, but also won<br />\na major decision. Jake Zinders<br />\n(142 lbs.) scored a 3 point decision. Carl Pallais (150 lbs.) and<br />\nHuber finished off the scoring for<br />\nthe day both earning technical<br />\nfalls.<br />\nOn Saturday, the Jays hosted<br />\nWidener, Swathmore, and Ursinus. The Jays started off with<br />\na surprisingly easy victory over<br />\n<br />\npreviously unbeaten Widener.<br />\nSam Wong (118 lbs.), Abdi,<br />\nZinders, and Terry Bailey all<br />\nposted victories. In the 134 lb.<br />\nclass Gagliostro dominated his<br />\nmatch for the first two periods.<br />\nHe went for the kill in the third<br />\nperiod using the Italian arm lock<br />\nto put his foe on his back. He applied too much strength and<br />\ndislocated his opponent's<br />\nshoulder. It was the third time this<br />\nyear he has won by default. Ricci won yet another victory.<br />\nThe only Blue Jay who lost was<br />\nTony Stratakos. A first year<br />\nwrestler, Stratakos made an impressive showing, taking Matt<br />\nBurns, a two-time All-American,<br />\nto overtime, only to give up a last<br />\nsecond takedown and lose by one<br />\npoint.<br />\nIn the meet against Ursinus, the<br />\nBlue Jays showcased several<br />\nyoung wrestlers and came very<br />\nclose to pulling off an upset.<br />\nFreshman John Dicamillo<br />\nregistered his first-ever decision.<br />\nFirst-year wrestlers Bill Sawyer<br />\nand Will Deitrick impressed the<br />\nhome crowd with victories. It was<br />\nthe ninth straight match for<br />\nDeitrick that ended with a pin.<br />\nDominic Wiker engaged in a<br />\n\"discussion\" with the referee<br />\nover a bad call and was politely<br />\nasked to leave the gym. The incident cost the team one team<br />\npoint, which fortunately had no<br />\neffect on the eventual outcome.<br />\nThe match with Swathmore<br />\nwas by far the most exciting<br />\nmatch of the year. The excitement built to such a state that the<br />\ncapacity crowd was brought to its<br />\nfeet for the last five matches. The<br />\nlead changed hands several times,<br />\nbut the Blue Jays ended up on top<br />\n21-20. The Jays started off fast<br />\nwith Hsich, Restituccia, and Tucci posting victories.<br />\nCarl Pallais won his match<br />\ndespite showing up late. Sam<br />\nBaldwin followed with an overtime victory against the returning<br />\nMAC champion at the' 158 lb.<br />\nclass. The match came down to<br />\nHuber who needed a pin to secure<br />\nthe team victory. He put his opponent on his back but time ran<br />\nout in the second period before he<br />\ncould get the pin. Huber once<br />\nagain put his opponent on his<br />\nback, this time with plenty of time<br />\nremaining and eventually pinned<br />\nhim, finalizing the win for the<br />\nteam.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men's<br />\nbasketball team clinched a spot in<br />\nthe MAC playoffs Wednesday<br />\nnight when they crunched lowly<br />\nHaverford, 106-56, and<br />\nWashington College eliminated<br />\nWidener by beating them 63-52.<br />\nThe most likely playoff scenario<br />\nhas Hopkins visiting Franklin &<br />\nMarshall Thursday night.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were in dire<br />\nneed of a win, as Widener was<br />\nthreatening to tie them for the last<br />\nplayoff spot, and there was no<br />\nbetter time to have Haverford on<br />\nthe schedule. The Fords brought<br />\na pathetic 0-22 record to the<br />\nNewton H. White, Jr. Athletic<br />\nCenter, and it was evident from<br />\nthe outset that loss number 23 was<br />\nnot far off. The Jays, on the<br />\nstrength of a swarming defense<br />\nand an early offensive explosion<br />\nby David Strong, whom got the<br />\nstart in his final regular season<br />\nhome game, raced out to a 13-0<br />\n<br />\nlead in the first four minutes of<br />\nplay. Haverford broke the ice<br />\nwhen Justin Smith connected on<br />\na short jumper, but Hopkins<br />\nscored nine more quick points.<br />\nThe Blue Jays honored their<br />\nseniors with a brief ceremony<br />\nbefore the game, as Strong,<br />\nZahn, Andy Enfield, Eric<br />\nHastings, and Dave Eikenberg<br />\nwere recognized for their four<br />\nyears of service. Strong, who<br />\nscored eight points and notched<br />\ntwo steals in fifteen minutes,<br />\nshowed that he is still a top performer despite being moved to<br />\nnumber three on the point guard<br />\ndepth chart. Enfield added fifteen<br />\npoints to his all-time school<br />\nrecord total, although he only<br />\nshot three of four from the free<br />\nthrow line, lowering his season<br />\npercentage from 95.0 percent to<br />\n94.2 percent. With his two threepointers, Zahn showed the<br />\ncoaching staff that he should have<br />\nhad the green light from deep for<br />\nthe past four years. Hastings,<br />\n<br />\nHopkins, now 15-9, will most<br />\nlikely not receive an at-large bid<br />\nto the NCAA tournament this<br />\nyear, according to knowledgeable<br />\nsources. Therefore, the only<br />\nroute to 'The Show' is through<br />\nthe automatic bid, which goes to<br />\nthe winner of the MAC tournament.

Nelson inherited a<br />\nteam that was, to say the least,<br />\ndeficient in more than one area.<br />\nHopkins dropped to 6-18 in<br />\nNelson's first year. Since then,<br />\nthe Jays have gone 12-12,17-10,<br />\nand last season finished 20-8, earning a berth in the NCAA tournament for the first time since the<br />\n1973-74 season and advancing to<br />\nthe round of 16.<br />\n\"When I got here, I could see<br />\nright away that we lacked a point<br />\nguard and a scorer,\" Nelson said<br />\nin a recent interview. \"Enter<br />\nDave Eikenberg and Andy Enfield.\" For college coaches,<br />\nrecruiting good players is half of<br />\nthe battle, and Nelson has proved adept. Nelson takes a simple<br />\napproach to recuiting: \"We look<br />\nfor players from winning programs and from quality homes,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We look for good<br />\ncitizens who want to study and<br />\nplay basketball.\"<br />\nGetting commitments from<br />\nplayers isn't always easy, of<br />\ncourse. \"We just show them<br />\nwhat we have to offer,\" continued Nelson. No cars? \"No<br />\ncars.\" Nelson makes sure not to<br />\nmislead potential recruits by promising the sky. \"We don't<br />\nguarantee anyone a starting position,\" he said. \"That can lead to<br />\na lot of problems later.\" On the<br />\nother hand, most Blue Jay players<br />\nwill get a chance to show what<br />\nthey can do.\"We try not to overrecruit; we recruit in areas that<br />\n'jnruit Rrinfms<br />\nred.<br />\nsuch as player ditsaiiiradlion can<br />\nbe minimized. After this season,<br />\nfor example, Hopkins will lose<br />\nfour starters to graduation, so<br />\nNelson recruited heavily and<br />\n<br />\nwound up with one of the more<br />\ntalented freshman classes in recent memory. This season allows<br />\nthem to get accustomed to the college level and to Nelson's system<br />\nso that next year they will be able<br />\nto step in and adequately fill the<br />\nvacancies. Conversely, Nelson<br />\ndidn't recruit this year since there<br />\nwill not be many spots open next<br />\nseason.<br />\nAssistant coaches Ed Richardson and Bob McCone have also<br />\nbeen major contributors to the<br />\nturnaround in the Hopkins basketball program. Richardson joined<br />\nthe coaching staff in 1986-87,<br />\nfollowed by McCone in 1987-88.<br />\n\"I give my assistants a lot of<br />\nleeway,\" stated Nelson. \"If they<br />\nweren't good they wouldn't be<br />\nhere.\"<br />\n<br />\nRichardson's main responsibilities are to work with<br />\nHopkins inside players, and on<br />\neach individual's offense in<br />\ngeneral. \"With the big men, we<br />\ntry to get them into a position<br />\nwhere they're most effective,\"<br />\nRichardson said. \"We try to<br />\nenhance what they have and add<br />\nto that, like getting them to turn<br />\neither way or pass off the postup.,,<br />\nRichardson will on several occasions work individually with a<br />\nplayer to help him improve. \"If<br />\nyou spot a flaw,\" he explained,<br />\n\"you pull that player aside and<br />\ntalk to him and help him correct<br />\nit.\" Richardson is also responsible for figuring out ways to beat<br />\nzone defenses, which is essential<br />\non the collegiate level since many<br />\n<br />\nBill Berger<br />\nHead coach Bill Nelson shouts instructions from bench.<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br />\n(2/15 - 2/21)<br />\n<br />\nteams use zones to cover for the<br />\ndefensive weaknesses of their<br />\n7:30 pm<br />\n2/15<br />\nWashington College<br />\nFri.<br />\nMen's Basketball<br />\nplayers or to keep their inside<br />\nMAC Playoffs:<br />\nTue. 2/19<br />\nIBA<br />\nFranklin 8 Marshall<br />\npeople out of foul trouble.<br />\nMcCone is Hopkins' defensive<br />\nMAC Playoffs:<br />\nThur. 2/21<br />\nWomen's<br />\nspecialist.

That's right<br />\n20 pounds in 14 days! The basis oftha diet is chemical food action and was devised<br />\nby a famous Colorado physician especially for the U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy<br />\nis maintained(very important!) while reducing. You keep \"full\" \u2014no starvation<br />\n\u2014 because the diet is designed that way. It's a diet that is easy to follow whether<br />\nYOU work, travel or stay at home.<br />\nThis is, honestly, a fantastically successful diet. If it weren't, the U.S.<br />\nWomen's Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! Right? So, give yourself the<br />\nsame break the U.S. Ski Team gets. Lose weight the scientific, proven way. Even<br />\nif you've tried all the other diets, you owe it to yourself to try the U.S. Women's Ski<br />\nTeam Diet. That is, if you really do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.

Hopkins<br />\nused a sixty-one second span in<br />\nthe third period to score three<br />\ngoals and ice the game. Team<br />\ncaptain Dave Bowyer played a<br />\nsolid game in goal with twentyone saves including several sterling plays to lead the Jays to their<br />\nseventh win of the season.<br />\nHopkins opened the scoring<br />\nearly in the first but Dickinson<br />\ncame right back and tied the game<br />\non a pretty two-on-one with the<br />\nlead skater dropping a pass for the<br />\ntrailer who fired it past Bowyer.<br />\nHalf way through the period Boxenbaum picked up Chiasson's<br />\nlong rebound and blasted a shot<br />\nfrom the right slot giving the Jays<br />\na 2-1 lead.

Hooper Conrad grabbed control of the puck at the blue<br />\nline getting it into the offensive<br />\nzone before ,dishing to Malcolm<br />\nLloyd, who passed to a wide open<br />\nSprague in the left slot.

This is our first<br />\nyear in division three and we<br />\nwere able to complete with all the<br />\nteams even though some of them<br />\nrecruit.\"<br />\nShe continued,\"We beat Middlebury and Smith and just barely lost to Colby.\" The other two<br />\nteams in the the division, Vassar<br />\nand Tufts, placed one and two in<br />\nthe championships and were<br />\ntougher competitors.<br />\nThe team was at a skill level<br />\ncomparable to the other teams,<br />\nbut Cushman believes that the<br />\nteam was hurt by its short season.<br />\nShe said, \"the other teams play<br />\ntwelve to fifteen tournaments. We<br />\nhave an extremely short season<br />\nand most of our tournaments are<br />\nsmall. This weekend we played<br />\nfive teams and I think the team<br />\nmembers were tired by Sunday.\"<br />\nJessica Tropp agreed. \"We<br />\nwere really tired toward the end<br />\nof the tournament, but we won<br />\nour last match against Smith<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nCushman added, \"we also<br />\naren't used to playing teams with<br />\nsuch a high level of ability.

She also won four<br />\nof her five matches. In the four<br />\nmatches she won, she only gave<br />\nup one game to an opponent.<br />\nAimee Machado, the number<br />\neight player, also contributed by<br />\nonly losing one match. She easily beat three of her opponents in<br />\nthree straight games. Christina<br />\nvon Riesenfelder also did well<br />\nand won three of her five games.<br />\nTara Dorr and Jessica Tropp<br />\nplayed in the number one and<br />\nnumber two positions, respectively. Many of the division three<br />\nteams recruit and many of the top<br />\nranked players are excellent<br />\n<br />\nsquash players. As a result both<br />\nof the top ranked Hopkins players<br />\nhad a hard time at the tournament. Cushman commented, \"I<br />\nknow they had a tough time, but<br />\nat this level most of the other<br />\nschools have one or two incredible competitors.\"<br />\nThe team's elevation to division three allows them to send<br />\ntwo players to the National Intercollegiate Singles Championship<br />\nin March. Dorr and Tropp will<br />\nautomatically get invited to the<br />\ncompetition because of their<br />\nranking within the team. The<br />\nCushmans are also hoping to obtain invitations for either Dupont<br />\nof Phillips.<br />\nThe team is only losing one<br />\nsenior, Glynnis Dales, to graduation and Jill Litt will be abroad<br />\nnext year.

Campbell emphasized<br />\nthat he is not an ardent anti-war<br />\nactivist but wondered \"why the<br />\nadministration has drawn such a<br />\nsharp moral line in this instance.\"<br />\nCampbell also noted that while<br />\nthe U.S. has focused on Saddam<br />\nHussein and his pretentions, Hussein's power was increased mainly through arms sales by Western<br />\ncountries, including the manufacture of chemical weapons.<br />\n\"President Bush has stated his intentions to stand up to Hussein<br />\nwith his weapons of destruction,\"<br />\nhe added, \"but it was in fact the<br />\nUnited States who restarted the<br />\nproduction of chemical weapons.<br />\nAs vice-president at .the time,<br />\nGeorge Bush cast the deciding<br />\nvote in favor of the resolution.\"<br />\n\"I'd like to believe the Bush<br />\nadministration is serious about a<br />\nNew World Order, but I don't<br />\nbelieve they're serious, based on<br />\ntheir past policies,\" Campbell<br />\ncqntinued. \"I doubt whether any<br />\nnation can organize a New World<br />\nOrder; when a country has trouble managing its own domestic<br />\nbudget, it's hard to believe in it.\"<br />\nSpeaking on \"the language of<br />\nwar,\" History Professor JoAnne<br />\nparticularly<br />\nBrown<br />\nwas<br />\ndisturbed with the tendency to<br />\nview war as other games or diversions, such as football and video<br />\ngames.

To underscore this<br />\ntheme, he told the story of a<br />\nyoung man sitting near a Hassidic<br />\nrabbi on a train, trying to anger<br />\nthe rabbi, who does not believe<br />\nin male-female contact before<br />\nmarriage, by kissing his<br />\ngirlfriend. When the rabbi does<br />\nnot respond, Goldberg said, the<br />\nman demands to know what is<br />\nwrong with love such as Jacob<br />\nhas for Rachel in the Bible. The<br />\nrabbi replies, \"Jacob loved<br />\nRachel. You love yourself.\"<br />\nGoldberg also talked about<br />\nroles for men and women.<br />\nAlthough he is an Orthodox<br />\nrabbi, he said he does not believe<br />\nin such rigid structures.

Eisenhower Symposium. On<br />\nthe eve of the first official day of<br />\nfinals, Angelou brought a timely<br />\nadmonition to Hopkins students:<br />\n\"Take your education into your<br />\nown hands.\"<br />\nAngelou's serious message was<br />\ncarefully framed by an inspirational performance of song,<br />\npoetry, and story-telling, serving<br />\nboth to inject meaning into the<br />\nsometimes lonely studious road<br />\nand to provide a much-needed<br />\nrespite from the pressures of lastminute cramming.<br />\nAngelou was the last in a series<br />\nof speakers as part of the 1990<br />\nSymposium,\"Dreams Deferred:<br />\nA Perspective on Race Relations.\" Dr. William Richardson,<br />\nPresident of the University, gave<br />\nan introduction that commended<br />\nthe hard work that went into the<br />\nSymposium and condemned recent action by the Bush administration to stop the funding<br />\nof underrepresented minorities at<br />\ncolleges and universities, which<br />\nhe labelled \"the wrong message<br /><br />\nLecture<br />\nCovers<br />\nForeign<br />\nNations<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\none set out in literature. \"With<br />\nthe exposure of Egypt to foreign<br />\ncountries during the 12th to 19th<br />\ndynasties, high human qualities,<br />\nnot reptilian qualities, were<br />\nascribed to foreign princes,\" putting them on equal footing with<br />\nEgyptians, he said.<br />\nLoprieno cited the tale of<br />\nSinuhe as a case in point. Sinuhe<br />\nwas an Egyptian prince who flees<br />\nEgypt to the court of Ammunenshi of Upper Retenu, marries<br />\nAmmunenshi's daughter, and<br />\nbecomes Asiatic. He noted that<br />\nthe existence even of political<br />\nrefugees points to the shortcomings of Egyptian society, where<br />\n\"everyone was supposed to be so<br />\nhappy.\" Ammunenshi thus<br />\nreceives Sinuhe at his court with<br />\na \"superior detachment vis-a-vis<br />\nEgyptian society.\"<br />\nIn the tale of the Prince of<br />\nNaharain, according to Loprieno,<br />\nan Egyptian wins the hand of the<br />\nprince's daughter in competition.<br />\nAlthough initially reluctant to accept an Egyptian as his son-inlaw, the Prince of Naharain<br />\n\"realizes he is a fine fellow,\"<br />\nLoprieno highlighted the unusual<br />\nwarmth with which the prince<br />\nwelcomes the Egyptian into his<br />\nfamily.<br />\nLoprieno concluded by noting<br />\nthat the literary periods of Egypt<br />\ncoincide with the periods of most<br />\nintense contact with foreign countries, particularly with Asia. In<br />\nhis opinion, the intellectual class<br />\nemancipate<br />\n\"to<br />\nwanted<br />\nthemselves literarily\" and free<br />\nthemselves from the strictures of<br />\ntheological and governmental<br />\ndogma.

She offered their<br />\npoetry as expressions of love, expressions that, if sought out and<br />\nappreciated, have much to teach<br />\nall people, young and old, in<br />\nsociety today. Her readings of<br />\nsuch poets as Georgia Douglas<br />\nJohnson, Nikki Giovanni, and<br />\nPaul Laurence Dunbar were lively and entertaining and they all<br />\nused \"intelligence to get their<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br /><br />\nMaya Angelou was the last<br />\nspeaker in the 1990 Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Symposium.<br />\nof access and responsibility in<br />\neducation. Angelou urged the audience to \"go to the library\" and<br />\nexplore the poetry and literature<br />\nof various cultures. She situated<br />\nthe final responsibility for education squarely upon the shoulders<br />\nof the individual. \"Let the library<br />\neducate you,\" she said.<br />\nAngelou reminded students that<br />\nwhen the resources are available,<br />\nas they certainly are for a student<br />\nat an institution like Johns<br />\nHopkins, the student must make<br />\nher own education a reality for<br />\nherself. \"A good student can<br />\nmake a mediocre teacher great.\"<br />\nAngelou's conclusion was no<br />\nless dramatic than the rest of her<br />\nlecture.

There<br />\nwas no mail for Miranda in the<br />\nmailbox.<br />\nIt took four days for a letter to<br />\ncross America from east coast to<br />\nwest. Ten days ago she had sent<br />\nher letter to David. Here it was,<br />\nFebruary 14th, the day that out<br />\nof any she should get a letter from<br />\nher boyfriend, and the only valentines in the mailbox were for<br />\nDoris. Seven valentines for<br />\nDoris. Miranda didn't think that<br />\nDoris knew seven people.<br />\nUnderneath the valentines was a<br />\ncopy of Zack's Writer's Digest<br />\nmagazine.<br />\nMiranda wondered for a moment why Zack's mail was coming to their apartment, but then<br />\nrealized that it was probably the<br />\nonly way he would ever get his<br />\nmail.<br />\nOn the way to campus, Miranda counted seven couples holding<br />\nhands. Three of them kissed in<br />\npublic. One couple was dressed<br />\nalike in red and black. Miranda<br />\ndidn't even know what David was<br />\nwearing. She checked her watch.<br />\n11:32 a.m. Okay, she did know<br />\nwhat David was wearing, three<br />\ntime zones away: nothing.<br />\nSomehow that didn't make<br />\nMiranda feel better.<br />\nOn campus, she headed to the<br />\npost office to mail off David's<br />\nwhy-didn't-I-get-a-letter-fromyou letter. In front of the building<br />\nwas a flower salesman. He smiled at her, and she wondered what<br />\nshe could do with those flowers<br />\nto cause the most amount of<br />\nphysical pain.<br />\nCircle K had set up a booth outside of the post office selling candy packages. Miranda somehow<br />\ncouldn't imagine anyone she<br />\nknew falling for this shameless<br />\ndisplay of capitalism. Then she<br />\nthought again, as Zack was at the<br />\nbooth buying an extra-large Luv-<br /><br />\nBasket.<br />\n\"Zack, you aren't getting that<br />\nfor Carol, are you?\"<br />\n\"Huh? Oh, hi, Miranda!\"<br />\n\"Hi.\"<br />\n\"No, I think I'm pretty much<br />\nover Carol. I mean, it's been<br />\nwhat? Six months? Two years? I<br />\ncan't remember.\"<br />\n\"Yeah, neither could she,\"<br />\nMiranda added. \"What did it take<br /><br />\nWhile bemoaning her lack<br />\nof valentines, Miranda<br />\nsaw Zack at the Circle K<br />\nbooth buying an extralarge Luv-Basket<br />\nher? Six minutes? Two hours?\"<br />\nZack blanched a bit and Miranda felt sorry.<br />\n\"Well, I'm over her,\" Zack<br />\nsaid with what conviction he<br />\ncould muster.<br />\n\"Well you're not getting them<br />\nfor me, are you?\" Miranda asked disdainfully, hoping he was.<br />\n\"No,\" he said, confirming to<br />\nMiranda that this was a bad day.<br />\n\"I'm going out with someone<br />\nnow.\"<br />\nThe world was changing,<br />\nMiranda thought. Zack had taken<br />\nto being single so well she<br />\nthought that he was supposed to<br />\nbe that way. Of course, she had<br />\nkind of taken to being in a relationship, and look what kind of<br />\nValentine's Day she had.<br />\n\"Who is it?\" Miranda asked.<br />\n\"And will you be sleeping on her<br />\ncouch from now on?\"<br />\n\"Her name's Kirsten, and no,<br />\nher roommate doesn't like me<br />\nthat much. I'll probably still stay<br />\non yours.\"<br />\n\"My pleasure is boundless,<br />\nZack.\"<br />\n\"Hey, did you see the latest<br />\nnewspaper?\" Zack asked.<br />\n\"Aside from doing the `Rachelle<br />\nContinued on page 5<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nWas Leadership the Problem All Along?<br />\nIn the aftermath of the rape on campus last Saturday night, many<br />\nare besieged by feelings of vulnerability, helplessness, frustration,<br />\nand rage. There are no remedies and few satisfying outlets for these<br />\nfeelings\u2014what, really, can we do?<br />\nPreventive measures, too late, are reemphasized, and questions<br />\nof risk, responsibility, and blame materialize soon after. One point<br />\nthat evaporates in the urgency of the moment is that we all take risks,<br />\nto varying degrees, every day. Crime is pervasive and tenacious;<br />\nit will always find a victim.<br />\nThough the issue of campus security is dwarfed by the ramifications of rape, this crime prompts the News-Letter once again to hold<br />\nHomewood Security up to the performance yardstick. It is unfair to<br />\npoint an accusing finger at Security each time a crime is committed<br />\non campus or against a student; nonetheless, it is important to ask<br />\nquestions after a tragedy occurs.<br />\nTellingly, the questions that come to mind have been asked many<br />\ntimes before, and as recently as last semester. What is the role of<br />\nHomewood Security? Realistically, what can they be expected to offer<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community, given some apparently inherent<br />\nlimitations? How can the current organization best serve the needs<br />\nof this community?<br />\nLast semester Security took one or two preliminary steps toward<br />\nresponding to these questions. Unfortunately, what little progress it<br />\nmight have made has since been undermined by an attitude, evident<br />\nwithin Security itself, that stands in apparent opposition to that<br />\norganization's stated goals.<br />\nThis attitude is perhaps most evident\u2014and most offensive\u2014in the<br />\ninadequate, inaccurate, and suspiciously tardy Security Bulletin informing the campus of Saturday's incident. One thing that Security<br />\ncan do\u2014without pleading lack of manpower, lack of jurisdiction,<br />\nor lack of responsibility\u2014is dispense crucial information that affects<br />\nthe immediate safety of the Homewood community. The Security<br />\nBulletin should have been distributed all over campus and in<br />\neveryone's mailbox by Monday morning. It should have more accurately explained the incident (the victim was abducted from the<br />\nstreet, not attacked in the woods). It should have included more comprehensive prevention information, as well as details regarding specific<br /><br />\nHomewood Security services.<br />\nThe Community Crime Report, or rather its conspicuous absence<br />\nin the News-Letter this semester, is another example of a service that<br />\nSecurity can and should be performing but somehow manages to \"put<br />\noff\" until it becomes convenient to do so. The Report came into being last semester in response to an obvious need and with the labor<br />\nof a few dedicated individuals. But understanding the importance of<br />\nthis endeavor\u2014not to mention its support in the community\u2014did not<br />\nextend high enough into the echelons of power and authority. As a<br />\nresult, the Community Crime Report tumbled into someone's indefinite \"in\" box.<br />\nThe Crime Report and Security Bulletins are two concrete, wholly reasonable tasks for Homewood Security that it currently can't<br />\nseem to handle. Yet these two examples reflect not only two specific<br />\nand resolvable problems but a disturbing attitude as well\u2014an attitude<br />\nthat endangers this campus and that so far has been immutable in<br />\nthe face of initiative from within and without.<br />\nPerhaps it was this same attitude that turned last semester's peaceful<br />\ndemonstration addressing the ROTC question into a potentially,<br />\nthough unnecessarily, dangerous situation. A form of expression<br />\nunusual for Homewood\u2014active protest\u2014was employed, and volatile<br />\nissues were addressed, but the only individuals who appeared to feel<br />\ngravely and immediately threatened (and who exhibited dangerous<br />\nbehavior) were the officers of Homewood Security. They exhibited<br />\na profound lack of understanding for the situation. Rooted in this<br />\nlack of understanding was an attitude that planted, then heightened,<br />\na sense of impending threat. This gave birth to ideas of force, then<br />\nan ethic of 'Security versus the students,' and ultimately, action<br />\nwithout thought.<br />\nAttitude is a slippery notion, difficult to pin down. But it is connected in important ways to inter-relating, communicating, and performing a job effectively. Attitude comes from the top. The leader<br />\nof any organization sets a tone in both word and action\u2014in actions<br />\ndone and not done\u2014that ultimately shapes that organization.<br />\nHomewood Security needs a leader who can set that tone, maintain<br />\nit, and rebuild that organization.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nChecking into the IBM-Hopkins-South Africa Triangle;<br />\n(In)actions and Stereotypes; A Reporter Responds<br />\nTo theeditors:<br />\nFive hundred and forty three IBM<br />\nemployees, including myself, have<br />\nsubmitted a stockholder resolution<br />\ncalling on IBM to end sales to South<br />\nAfrica, Harold Brown, Chairman of<br />\nthe Foreign Policy Institute of Johns<br />\nHopkins University, is one of the<br />\neighteen people to whom our campaign is directed since he is a<br />\nmember of the IBM board of<br />\ndirectors\u2014for which service<br />\nreceives about $60,000 from IBM.<br />\nFor two years IBM has refused to<br />\nconfirm or deny reports in South<br />\nAfrican publications that it sells to<br />\nmilitary contractors in South Africa.<br />\nIn his role as an independent<br />\nacademic official, I would encourage<br />\nMr. Brown to investigate and present the truth.<br />\nThe issue of supplying military<br />\ncontractors in South Africa is important because the white minority<br />\nmaintains rule not by the free choice<br />\nof South African citizens, but by<br />\nforce and violence. Apartheid is still<br />\nin place: despite recent announcements, blacks are still excluded from the vote; race is still the<br />\nlegal basis for political, social,<br />\neducational, and<br />\neconomic<br />\ndiscrimination; over three thousand<br />\npolitical prisoners remain behind<br />\nbars; and twenty thousand remain in<br />\nexile. And government death squads<br />\nand vigilantes continue to terrorize.<br />\nIBM has supplied South Africa<br />\nwith more mainframe computers<br />\nthan any other company. IBM has<br />\nacknowledged that nearly all its<br />\ncustomers in South Africa are<br />\nmembers of the white minority; thus,<br />\nits computers are used almost ex'elusively to bolster white power.<br />\nIBM has also acknowledged that the<br />\ncomputers IBM ships permit South<br />\nAfrica to maintain a strong<br />\neconomy, competitive with that of<br />\nother industrialized nations (1990<br />\nIBM proxy). Thus, IBM helps South<br />\nAfrica overcome the sanctions imposed by the world community.<br />\nIn view of South Africa's strategy<br />\nof fomenting violence and military<br />\naggression, and in view of its determination to develop nuclear<br />\nweapons, I am deeply concerned<br />\nabout the fact that IBM is listed as<br />\nhaving shipped mainframe computers to major South African<br />\nmilitary contractors, including<br />\nGrinaker Electronics, Plessy, Dorbyl, and Phillips (\"Computer Users<br />\nHandbook\", South Africa, 1987.<br />\nSouth Africa prohibited later editions<br />\nof this handbook). I am equally concerned that IBM supplied computers<br />\nto run production at two South<br />\nAfrican oil refineries that supply fuel<br />\nfor military vehicles (\"Computer<br />\nMail\", South Africa, 6-25-86 and<br />\n6-26-87).<br />\nIf IBM does engage in such sales,<br />\nI believe that Mr. Brown's saying so<br />\nwould make this sales program<br /><br />\nuntenable. Since high-technology<br />\nproducts such as mainframe computers are among the few major<br />\nitems that South Africa must import,<br />\nhalting these IBM shipments would<br />\nadd to the pressure for genuine<br />\nchange in South Africa,<br />\nI hope Mr. Brown will report the<br />\nfacts about IBM sales to South<br />\nAfrica military contractors. Because<br />\nSouth Africa has not halted its<br />\nviolence, there is no time to lose.<br />\nJames Leas<br />\nStaff Engineer for IBM<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am writing in response to last<br />\nweek's letter by Greg Gagnon and<br />\nManuel P. Micaller, Jr. concerning<br />\ntheir fraternity's innocence in \"promot[ing] and perpetuat[ing] sexism,...and misogyny\": \"Kappa<br />\nSigma Fraternity is not, nor has ever<br />\nbeen guilty of these.\" I strongly<br />\nagree with the authors that Greeks<br />\ndo not \"band together\" in order to<br />\npromote such ideas, but seemingly<br />\nharmless actions can often inadvertently reinforce negative<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nDuring Fraternity Rush, I<br />\nreceived a flyer publicizing a Kappa Sigma function. The graphic consisted of a buxom, bikini-clad<br />\nwoman with the Greek letters Kappa Sigma branded on her inner thigh.<br />\nThe branding of a woman with<br />\nfraternity letters only furthers the<br />\nidea of the female as a possession,<br />\nexplicitly for men. What place does<br />\nthis sort of notion have in an<br />\norganization whose self-proclaimed<br />\n\"raison d'etre\" is \"positive<br />\nthings\"? ILest we forget that the<br />\npositive community service project<br />\ncited in last week's letter, Toys for<br />\nTots, was tainted by the use of<br />\nmisogynistic flyers proclaiming<br />\n\"Toys for Twats.\"1<br />\nI do not seek to condemn the<br />\nGreek system, nor Kappa Sigma in<br />\nparticular; I do hope that this incident encourages us all to examine<br />\nresponsibly the possible implications<br />\nof our actions.

Perlstein<br />\nr;<br />\n,To the Editors:<br />\ns*Zook.,<br />\nLast week I was severely misquoted by News-Letter staff writer<br />\nHarry Milling in his article regarding<br />\nRogers House.<br />\nIn the article, Mr. Milling<br />\nreported that I had said administrators \"expressed concern that<br />\na fraternity's occupation of Rogers<br />\nHouse may not 'run as smoothly' as<br />\na sorority's occupation might.\"<br />\nBy quoting me in this manner, Mr.<br />\nMilling inferred that administrators<br />\nfelt that fraternities would not adhere<br />\nto University regulations, and that is<br />\nsimply not the case. As I expressed<br />\nto Mr. Milling on at least three<br />\noccasions, the general consent in the<br />\nHomewood Schools Services Advisory Committee is that it would be<br />\ntragic to deny fraternities housing<br />\nbecause of preconceived notions<br />\nabout their conduct. In the meeting,<br />\nDean Colombo clearly stated that he<br />\nrefused to discriminate against<br />\nfraternities.<br />\nI caution both the Mr. Milling and<br />\nthe News-Letter against misquoting<br />\ninterviewees in order to add validity to a specific writer's opinion. As<br />\njournalists, it is your responsibility<br />\nto present the facts and allow your<br />\nreaders to formulate opinions of their<br />\nown.<br />\nCraig M. Freeman<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn a letter published in last week's<br />\nedition of the News-Letter, Mary<br />\nShaffer accuses my article \"Hopkins<br />\nStudents, Alums in the Gulf\" of<br />\n\"imitat(ing) the very worst of the<br />\nmass media in its coverage of the<br />\nwar.\"<br />\nLike Ms. Shaffer, I was' in<br />\nWashington, D.C. for the<br />\ndemonstration on January 19th,<br />\nalthough not the 26th. While in<br />\nLafayette Square, I was struck not<br />\nonly by the sheer number of<br />\ndemonstrators, but also by the array<br />\nof political beliefs being so adamantly expressed in one small space.

We<br />\nreserve the right to limit the<br />\nnumber of letters printed in<br />\na given issue.<br /><br />\nseems to me that the very essence of<br />\nthe demonstration was to be found<br />\nin this ideological diversity, since<br />\nclearly our involvement in the Midhas<br />\npolitically<br />\ndle<br />\nEast<br />\ndivided the nation to an extent which<br />\nmost individuals of student age have<br />\nnever before witnessed.<br />\nIn my second sentence, the one so<br />\nheavily criticized by Ms. Shaffer, I<br />\nstate simply \"Thousands of<br />\ndemonstrators both supporting and<br />\nopposing U.S. intervention in the<br />\nMiddle East have congregated in<br />\nWashington, D.C. during the past<br />\ntwo weeks. . .\" without quantification of one or the other. Certainly<br />\nthose opposing the war outnumbered<br />\nthose supporting it at the demonstration; in retrospect, the order of the<br />\ntwo critical terms ought to have been<br />\nreversed and this was an oversight<br />\non my part. However, Ms. Shaffer<br />\nasks for \"objective truth,\" and this<br />\ntruth is quite simply that representatives of both sides were present at<br />\nthese two demonstrations, and continue to make their respective community and even national headlines<br />\nas examples of a divided American<br />\npeople.<br />\nFinally, Ms. Shaffer accuses<br />\nmyself and the entire News-Letter<br />\nstaff of taking a stand on the war<br />\nunder the guise ofjournalistic objectivity. As a staff writer, I would certainly not presume to speak on behalf<br />\nof any other member of the NewsLetter. Furthermore, my own personal politics, especially as<br />\nmisconstrued by Ms. Shaffer, are in<br />\nno way reflected in my article.<br />\nI apologize to Ms. Shaffer and any<br />\nother readers who were offended by<br />\nmy reference to the demonstration.<br />\nHowever, since I made neither a<br />\nquantitative nor qualitative statement, and instead only briefly<br />\nestablished a backdrop for the focus<br />\nof my article, her criticisms seem<br />\nunfair, and her conclusions<br />\nunfounded.<br />\nKathleen Curry<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was disheartened by the rude<br />\ncomments the editors made in<br />\nresponse to a letter from Mary Shaffer. It is not a sin to mistake the title<br />\nof the publication. There was no<br />\nneed to ridicule her. Your sarcasm<br />\nwas uncalled for. Her letter made it<br />\nquite clear that she was very familiar<br />\nwith the article to which she<br />\nreferred and that is what is important. I know it is hard to take<br />\ncriticism after all the hard work yotr<br />\nput into the paper. But, your<br />\nresponse was unprofessional.

While<br />\ntrying to suspend a pair of his<br />\nunderwear from the North Chiller<br />\nTower, he suddenly realized that<br />\nhe was incredibly drunk and very<br />\nmuch afraid of heights. As he<br />\nstruggled to regain his balance in<br />\nthe brutal wind, the poor fellow<br />\nwas struck by lightning and fell<br />\nmore than a hundred feet down<br />\nto a dumpster full of recycled<br />\nthumbtacks. Miraculously, he<br />\nsurvived, and when I dropped by<br />\nto see him, he had recovered<br />\nenough strength to sit up in traction and watch TV.

Based on the bestselling novel by Thomas Harris\u2014and<br />\nhewing to its text as closely as any<br />\nfilm in recent memory\u2014it is<br />\nthoroughly engaging and<br />\nultimately suspenseful, but one<br />\nwould be hard-pressed to describe<br />\nthe sensation as thrilling.<br />\nFor The Silence of the Lambs<br />\nis, at its core, so completely<br />\nrepugnant that the evil unfolding<br />\nbefore Demme's unrelenting<br />\ncameras simply doesn't register.<br />\nThe brain shuts off, skirting<br />\naround horrors that the mind tries<br />\nto imagine, but that are ultimately inconceivable.<br />\nJodie Foster stars as FBI<br />\ntrainee Clarice Starling, called in<br />\nby Behavioral Science Unit Chief<br />\nJack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to<br />\naid in the capture of \"Buffalo<br />\nBill.\" Buffalo Bill is a serial<br />\nkiller, preying upon young<br />\nwomen by keeping them<br />\nprisoner, skinning them and<br />\ndumping them in rivers across the<br />\ncountry.<br />\nStarling is a novice, and<br />\nCrawford's attachment to her and<br />\nefforts to groom her career are<br />\nexplained only in the simplest<br />\nterms. Many elements of the<br />\noriginal plot by Harris are<br />\nstreamlined in the film; screenwriter Ted Tally wisely removes<br /><br />\na few of the novel's more<br />\nmarginal subplots, and the narrative advances without unnecessary distraction.<br />\nStarling's glaring femininity in<br />\nwhat is mostly a man's world occasionally bubbles to the surface;<br />\nshe is the only female in the<br />\nBureau elevator; the male cadets<br />\ngawk at her as she jogs by; she<br />\nneeds a man's help to open a<br />\ngarage door. Starling is conscious<br />\nof her sex, but turns it into an advantage frequently enough to defy<br />\nfrail stereotypes.<br />\nBut these overt victories belie<br />\ndeeper insecurities, and her<br />\nweaknesses as a woman and a<br />\nperson are brutally dissected by<br />\nDr. Hannibal \"The Cannibal\"<br />\nLecter (Anthony Hopkins), a<br />\nbrilliant and deceptively vicious<br />\npsychiatrist turned psychopath.<br />\nStarling's first task is to interview<br />\nLecter from his isolation cell,<br />\ndeep in the bowels of a Baltimore<br />\nhospital.<br />\nAged but physically robust,<br />\nLecter was released from his cell<br />\nonce for a checkup, but bit the<br />\nface off a nurse, his pulse never<br />\nrising above 85 even as he ate her<br />\ntongue. These are the kind of<br />\nmind-numbing atrocities that<br />\npermeate The Silence of the<br />\nLambs: no killing is too<br />\nrepulsive, no idea too distasteful<br />\nfor thorough investigation by the<br />\nnarrative.<br />\nLecter's understanding of the<br /><br />\npsychopathic mind is a two-edged<br />\nsword; Lecter gives information<br />\nonly when he receives some of<br />\nhis own. \"Quid pro quo,\" he<br />\ncalls it, but it is far more than<br />\nthat. Lecter thrives on discovering the secret fears of others,<br />\nstripping away layers of defenses<br />\nwith a mind-reader's glee. In his<br />\nbattle with the outside world, it's<br />\nhis most effective weapon. In a<br />\nlocked room, it's his only one.<br />\nStarling's first meeting with<br />\nLecter, in which their curious<br />\nrelationship of mutual need is<br />\nestablished, begins with a gesture<br />\nthat speaks volumes. Lecter asks<br />\nto see Starling's credentials, and<br />\nshe holds them up. \"Closer,\" he<br />\nsays, and Starling extends her<br />\narm, the rest of her body motionless. She believes every story<br />\nshe's heard about him, and this<br />\nknowledge controls her actions<br />\ndown to the last.<br />\nIt's a perfectly staged scene that<br />\nshould have great impact, but<br />\nthings seem deliberately out of<br />\nsync. After all we've heard about<br />\nLecter, the real thing is creepy<br />\nenough, but anti-climactic.<br />\nDemme shoots Starling and<br />\nLecter in tight, thoughtful closeups, but all that initially comes<br />\nacross is that nothing comes<br />\nacross.<br />\nBuffalo Bill's latest victim happens to be the daughter of a prominent Senator, and as the killer<br />\ngoes to work on a gruesome pro-<br /><br />\nject, Lecter negotiates a transfer.<br />\nStarling closes in on Buffalo<br />\nBill's location, and her meetings<br />\nwith Lecter intensify, leading to<br />\nconfrontations with both killers:<br />\none physical, the other mental,<br />\nand both absolutely riveting.<br />\nThe storytelling starts<br />\nawkwardly, but The Silence ofthe<br />\nLambs succeeds because the horror is cumulative, not incremental. The mystery unfolds gradually, as Lecter offers clues and<br />\nothers are discovered. By the<br />\nfilm's end, we know more than<br />\nwe ever wanted to.<br />\nAs Starling, Foster's soft<br />\nfeatures hide a willful persistence,<br />\na determination to separate the<br />\nmysteries of the case from the<br />\nmysteries of her past unearthed<br />\nby Lecter. The lines blur frequently, much as Starling resists<br />\nit, and Foster masters the script<br />\nwith physical and psychological<br />\nprowess, most notably in a final,<br />\nexcruciatingly tense scene in Buffalo Bill's lair.<br />\nHopkins plays Lecter almost<br />\ntoo well. Bolstered by moody<br />\nlighting, he brings an otherworldly grace to the character, making<br />\nhis flashes of violence all the<br />\nmore chilling. Lecter acts like<br />\nhalf the people walking around<br />\nBaltimore\u2014chew on that for a<br />\nwhile. In any case, it's a terrific<br />\nperformance\u201e.i.<br />\nDemme deserves much of the<br />\ncredit for pulling everything off.<br /><br />\nTwo FBI agents (Scott Glenn, left; and Jodie Foster, right) hunt down<br />\na crazed psychiatrist(Anthony Hopkins, middle)in Jonathan Demme's<br />\nSilence Of The Lambs.<br />\nBest known for -Urban romps anreal becomes real, at least as<br />\nMarried to the Mob and<br />\nlong as the mind permits it.<br />\nSomething Wild Demme directs<br />\nFor in its triumph, The Silence<br />\nwith energy and directness, ofthe Lambs negates all that it so<br />\nreminiscent of David Lynch but masterfully achieves.

Each man ofthe town would draw<br />\nfrom this urn and court the author of the<br />\nmessage he picked.<br />\nMore likely, however, Valentine's Day<br />\narose from the medieval belief that birds<br /><br />\nbegan to mate at the beginning of the<br />\nsecondfortnight of the second month.

Senior<br />\npost player Jennifer Luzietti turned in another solid effort for the<br />\nJays, netting 12 points, 5 steals,<br />\nand grabbing 11 rebounds. Senior<br />\nco-captain Kristie Kantowski also<br />\ncontributed 10 points and 9<br />\nboards.<br />\nThe Jays took a 38-27 lead into the locker room at halftime,<br />\nand despite being outscored in a<br />\nlackluster second half, they<br />\nmanaged to hang on for the win.<br />\nChicago shooters were frigid,<br />\nhitting only 35 percent of their<br />\nshots for the game, while the Jays<br />\nhit their season average of 46 percent from the field. Chicago.<br />\nmanaged to make 7-of-14 threepoint attempts, but that wasn't<br />\nenough as Hopkins punished<br />\nthem under the boards, outrebounding Chicago 43-32.

Hopkins outskateci, outshot, and outhit the Greyhounds<br />\nbn their way to a satisfying 4-3<br />\nvictory before a raucous crowd.<br />\nThe Blue Jays improved their<br />\nrecord to 8-4-2, moving them into<br />\na tie for second place in the<br />\nMason-Dixon league behind<br />\nTowson State.<br />\nHopkins did not capitalize on<br />\nearly power play opportunities,<br />\nbut did capitalize on strong-play<br />\nin the corners by assistant captain<br />\nDave Boxenbaum and Pat<br />\nChaisson, Chaisson used his<br />\nsuperior skating ability to outwork the covering Hound<br />\ndefenders and centered a pass that<br />\nwas deflected into the corner.<br />\nBoxenbaum, playing his second<br />\nconsecutive games without a<br />\npenalty, retrieved the puck in the<br />\ncorner and fed freshman John<br />\nTymkewitz in the slot.<br />\nTyrnkewitz converted the pass into a goal at 9:30 of the first period<br />\ngiving the Jays an early lead.<br />\nThree minutes later the same<br />\nthree players registered points as<br />\nChaisson once again stick handled through the Greyhound<br />\ndefense and ripped a shot over the<br />\ngoalie's glove from the right cir:le. After failing to convert on<br />\nanother power play the Jays looked as though they would end the<br />\nperiod with at 2-0 lead. Loyola<br />\nrelentlessly pounded away at a rebound and eventually snuck it<br />\npast Blue Jay goalie Pierre<br />\nChevray at 1:11 of the first. The<br />\nperiod ended with Loyola working a power play, but the score<br />\nremained 2-1 Hopkins.<br />\nLoyola tied the game with a<br />\nsharp angle wrist shot that<br />\nmanaged to sneak between<br />\nChevray's pads at 13:34 for<br />\nanother even strength goal.<br />\nHowever, Chevray came up big<br />\nover the next few minutes saving<br />\nthe Jays after successive miscues.<br />\nA two-on-one that nearly<br />\ndeveloped into a three-on-one<br />\nwas thwarted by a sparkling save.<br />\nChevray outdid himself when a<br />\nHopkins miscommunication at<br />\nthe blue line gave the shorthanded Greyhounds a one-on-none<br />\nDpportunity.<br />\nThe Jays dominated the rest of<br />\nContinued on page 19<br /><br />\nrecord to 12-9.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Jays didn't<br />\nhave as easy a time with UAA foe<br />\nWashington University, who<br />\nwere 18-4 and ranked fourth in<br />\nthe nation going into last Sunday's contest.

The Jays were<br />\noutrebounded 42-28, eeking out<br />\na paltry 6 offensive rebounds for<br />\nthe game.<br />\nThe Jays fared better in their<br />\nfinal regular season game against<br />\nMAC opponent Dickinson last<br />\nTuesday, rolling to a lopsided<br />\n73-47 victory. The Jays played<br />\nwithout Luzietti, who was out<br />\nwith the flu.<br />\nKantowski poured in 20 points<br />\nin addition to grabbing 10 rebounds to lead the Jays.

In the match<br />\nagainst Muhlenberg the Blue Jays<br />\nwon five of the ten matches but<br />\nlost on points. Captain Gary<br />\nHsich at 118 lbs., Tony<br />\nGagliostro at 126 lbs., and Scott<br />\nDrewes at 142 lbs. all won close<br />\ndecisions, while sophomore<br />\nMichael Ricci at 167 lbs.<br />\nregistered a pin. At 190 lbs., captain Scott Huber, avenged an<br />\nearlier loss using his aggressive<br />\nstyle to devastate his opponent.<br />\nAfter the match, Huber's opponent had to be helped from the<br />\nmat.<br />\nAgainst Albright the team looked much sharper. Jake Manella<br />\n(118 lbs.) started the team off in<br />\nthe right direction with a pin.<br />\nFreshmen Rob Restuccia (126<br />\nlbs.) and Danny Abdi(134 lbs.)<br />\ncontinued the onslaught with hard<br />\nfought victories. Sam Baldwin<br />\n(158 lbs.) also posted an impressive victory. Ricci earned his<br />\nsecond win of the day with a 16-0<br />\ndecision. Another double winner<br />\nwas Huber.

Hsich once again started<br />\nthe team with a win. Peter Tucci<br />\n(126 lbs.) followed with the<br />\nquickest pin of the season,just 12<br />\nseconds. Danny Organek's (134<br />\nlbs.) match showed the dedication<br />\nthis team has. He broke a finger<br />\nin the first period, yet not only<br />\nfinished the match, but also won<br />\na major decision. Jake Zinders<br />\n(142 lbs.) scored a 3 point decision. Carl Pallais (150 lbs.) and<br />\nHuber finished off the scoring for<br />\nthe day both earning technical<br />\nfalls.<br />\nOn Saturday, the Jays hosted<br />\nWidener, Swathmore, and Ursinus. The Jays started off with<br />\na surprisingly easy victory over<br /><br />\npreviously unbeaten Widener.<br />\nSam Wong (118 lbs.), Abdi,<br />\nZinders, and Terry Bailey all<br />\nposted victories. In the 134 lb.<br />\nclass Gagliostro dominated his<br />\nmatch for the first two periods.<br />\nHe went for the kill in the third<br />\nperiod using the Italian arm lock<br />\nto put his foe on his back. He applied too much strength and<br />\ndislocated his opponent's<br />\nshoulder. It was the third time this<br />\nyear he has won by default. Ricci won yet another victory.<br />\nThe only Blue Jay who lost was<br />\nTony Stratakos. A first year<br />\nwrestler, Stratakos made an impressive showing, taking Matt<br />\nBurns, a two-time All-American,<br />\nto overtime, only to give up a last<br />\nsecond takedown and lose by one<br />\npoint.<br />\nIn the meet against Ursinus, the<br />\nBlue Jays showcased several<br />\nyoung wrestlers and came very<br />\nclose to pulling off an upset.<br />\nFreshman John Dicamillo<br />\nregistered his first-ever decision.<br />\nFirst-year wrestlers Bill Sawyer<br />\nand Will Deitrick impressed the<br />\nhome crowd with victories.

The incident cost the team one team<br />\npoint, which fortunately had no<br />\neffect on the eventual outcome.<br />\nThe match with Swathmore<br />\nwas by far the most exciting<br />\nmatch of the year. The excitement built to such a state that the<br />\ncapacity crowd was brought to its<br />\nfeet for the last five matches. The<br />\nlead changed hands several times,<br />\nbut the Blue Jays ended up on top<br />\n21-20. The Jays started off fast<br />\nwith Hsich, Restituccia, and Tucci posting victories.<br />\nCarl Pallais won his match<br />\ndespite showing up late. Sam<br />\nBaldwin followed with an overtime victory against the returning<br />\nMAC champion at the' 158 lb.<br />\nclass. The match came down to<br />\nHuber who needed a pin to secure<br />\nthe team victory. He put his opponent on his back but time ran<br />\nout in the second period before he<br />\ncould get the pin. Huber once<br />\nagain put his opponent on his<br />\nback, this time with plenty of time<br />\nremaining and eventually pinned<br />\nhim, finalizing the win for the<br />\nteam.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men's<br />\nbasketball team clinched a spot in<br />\nthe MAC playoffs Wednesday<br />\nnight when they crunched lowly<br />\nHaverford, 106-56, and<br />\nWashington College eliminated<br />\nWidener by beating them 63-52.<br />\nThe most likely playoff scenario<br />\nhas Hopkins visiting Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall Thursday night.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were in dire<br />\nneed of a win, as Widener was<br />\nthreatening to tie them for the last<br />\nplayoff spot, and there was no<br />\nbetter time to have Haverford on<br />\nthe schedule. The Fords brought<br />\na pathetic 0-22 record to the<br />\nNewton H. White, Jr. Athletic<br />\nCenter, and it was evident from<br />\nthe outset that loss number 23 was<br />\nnot far off. The Jays, on the<br />\nstrength of a swarming defense<br />\nand an early offensive explosion<br />\nby David Strong, whom got the<br />\nstart in his final regular season<br />\nhome game, raced out to a 13-0<br /><br />\nlead in the first four minutes of<br />\nplay. Haverford broke the ice<br />\nwhen Justin Smith connected on<br />\na short jumper, but Hopkins<br />\nscored nine more quick points.<br />\nThe Blue Jays honored their<br />\nseniors with a brief ceremony<br />\nbefore the game, as Strong,<br />\nZahn, Andy Enfield, Eric<br />\nHastings, and Dave Eikenberg<br />\nwere recognized for their four<br />\nyears of service. Strong, who<br />\nscored eight points and notched<br />\ntwo steals in fifteen minutes,<br />\nshowed that he is still a top performer despite being moved to<br />\nnumber three on the point guard<br />\ndepth chart. Enfield added fifteen<br />\npoints to his all-time school<br />\nrecord total, although he only<br />\nshot three of four from the free<br />\nthrow line, lowering his season<br />\npercentage from 95.0 percent to<br />\n94.2 percent. With his two threepointers, Zahn showed the<br />\ncoaching staff that he should have<br />\nhad the green light from deep for<br />\nthe past four years. Hastings,<br /><br />\nHopkins, now 15-9, will most<br />\nlikely not receive an at-large bid<br />\nto the NCAA tournament this<br />\nyear, according to knowledgeable<br />\nsources.

Nelson inherited a<br />\nteam that was, to say the least,<br />\ndeficient in more than one area.<br />\nHopkins dropped to 6-18 in<br />\nNelson's first year. Since then,<br />\nthe Jays have gone 12-12,17-10,<br />\nand last season finished 20-8, earning a berth in the NCAA tournament for the first time since the<br />\n1973-74 season and advancing to<br />\nthe round of 16.<br />\n\"When I got here, I could see<br />\nright away that we lacked a point<br />\nguard and a scorer,\" Nelson said<br />\nin a recent interview. \"Enter<br />\nDave Eikenberg and Andy Enfield.\" For college coaches,<br />\nrecruiting good players is half of<br />\nthe battle, and Nelson has proved adept. Nelson takes a simple<br />\napproach to recuiting: \"We look<br />\nfor players from winning programs and from quality homes,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We look for good<br />\ncitizens who want to study and<br />\nplay basketball.\"<br />\nGetting commitments from<br />\nplayers isn't always easy, of<br />\ncourse. \"We just show them<br />\nwhat we have to offer,\" continued Nelson. No cars? \"No<br />\ncars.\" Nelson makes sure not to<br />\nmislead potential recruits by promising the sky. \"We don't<br />\nguarantee anyone a starting position,\" he said. \"That can lead to<br />\na lot of problems later.\" On the<br />\nother hand, most Blue Jay players<br />\nwill get a chance to show what<br />\nthey can do.\"We try not to overrecruit; we recruit in areas that<br />\n'jnruit Rrinfms<br />\nred.<br />\nsuch as player ditsaiiiradlion can<br />\nbe minimized. After this season,<br />\nfor example, Hopkins will lose<br />\nfour starters to graduation, so<br />\nNelson recruited heavily and<br /><br />\nwound up with one of the more<br />\ntalented freshman classes in recent memory. This season allows<br />\nthem to get accustomed to the college level and to Nelson's system<br />\nso that next year they will be able<br />\nto step in and adequately fill the<br />\nvacancies. Conversely, Nelson<br />\ndidn't recruit this year since there<br />\nwill not be many spots open next<br />\nseason.<br />\nAssistant coaches Ed Richardson and Bob McCone have also<br />\nbeen major contributors to the<br />\nturnaround in the Hopkins basketball program. Richardson joined<br />\nthe coaching staff in 1986-87,<br />\nfollowed by McCone in 1987-88.<br />\n\"I give my assistants a lot of<br />\nleeway,\" stated Nelson. \"If they<br />\nweren't good they wouldn't be<br />\nhere.\"<br /><br />\nRichardson's main responsibilities are to work with<br />\nHopkins inside players, and on<br />\neach individual's offense in<br />\ngeneral. \"With the big men, we<br />\ntry to get them into a position<br />\nwhere they're most effective,\"<br />\nRichardson said. \"We try to<br />\nenhance what they have and add<br />\nto that, like getting them to turn<br />\neither way or pass off the postup.,,<br />\nRichardson will on several occasions work individually with a<br />\nplayer to help him improve. \"If<br />\nyou spot a flaw,\" he explained,<br />\n\"you pull that player aside and<br />\ntalk to him and help him correct<br />\nit.\" Richardson is also responsible for figuring out ways to beat<br />\nzone defenses, which is essential<br />\non the collegiate level since many<br /><br />\nBill Berger<br />\nHead coach Bill Nelson shouts instructions from bench.<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Calendar<br />\n(2/15 - 2/21)<br /><br />\nteams use zones to cover for the<br />\ndefensive weaknesses of their<br />\n7:30 pm<br />\n2/15<br />\nWashington College<br />\nFri.<br />\nMen's Basketball<br />\nplayers or to keep their inside<br />\nMAC Playoffs:<br />\nTue. 2/19<br />\nIBA<br />\nFranklin 8 Marshall<br />\npeople out of foul trouble.<br />\nMcCone is Hopkins' defensive<br />\nMAC Playoffs:<br />\nThur. 2/21<br />\nWomen's<br />\nspecialist.

That's right<br />\n20 pounds in 14 days! The basis oftha diet is chemical food action and was devised<br />\nby a famous Colorado physician especially for the U.S. Ski Team. Normal energy<br />\nis maintained(very important!) while reducing. You keep \"full\" \u2014no starvation<br />\n\u2014 because the diet is designed that way. It's a diet that is easy to follow whether<br />\nYOU work, travel or stay at home.<br />\nThis is, honestly, a fantastically successful diet. If it weren't, the U.S.<br />\nWomen's Ski Team wouldn't be permitted to use it! Right? So, give yourself the<br />\nsame break the U.S. Ski Team gets. Lose weight the scientific, proven way. Even<br />\nif you've tried all the other diets, you owe it to yourself to try the U.S. Women's Ski<br />\nTeam Diet. That is, if you really do want to lose 20 pounds in two weeks.

Hopkins<br />\nused a sixty-one second span in<br />\nthe third period to score three<br />\ngoals and ice the game. Team<br />\ncaptain Dave Bowyer played a<br />\nsolid game in goal with twentyone saves including several sterling plays to lead the Jays to their<br />\nseventh win of the season.<br />\nHopkins opened the scoring<br />\nearly in the first but Dickinson<br />\ncame right back and tied the game<br />\non a pretty two-on-one with the<br />\nlead skater dropping a pass for the<br />\ntrailer who fired it past Bowyer.<br />\nHalf way through the period Boxenbaum picked up Chiasson's<br />\nlong rebound and blasted a shot<br />\nfrom the right slot giving the Jays<br />\na 2-1 lead. Craig Hampton closed the first period by scoring wiffi<br />\nan unassisted power play goal at<br />\nthe four minute mark.<br />\nDickinson moved a step closer<br /><br />\nContinued .from page 15<br />\nbe period, outshooting Loyola<br />\nifteen to seven as they maintainxi control the puck in Loyola's<br />\nzone for over eight minutes. With<br />\napproximately five minutes remaining in the second period the<br />\nJays went ahead on a wrist shot<br />\nby sophomore forward Jason<br />\nSprague. Hooper Conrad grabbed control of the puck at the blue<br />\nline getting it into the offensive<br />\nzone before ,dishing to Malcolm<br />\nLloyd, who passed to a wide open<br />\nSprague in the left slot. Leading<br />\n3-2 with time running out in the<br />\nsecond period the Jays were again<br />\ncalled for a penalty giving Loyola<br />\na power play chances early in the<br />\nthird.

Hopkins came<br />\nright back but the Dickinson<br />\ngoalie was equal to the task and<br />\nthe period ended with Hopkins<br />\nleading 3-2.<br />\nDickinson tied the game at<br />\n11:52 of the final period on Blue<br />\nJay miscue at the blue line.<br />\nHopkins left a Dickinson skater<br />\nopen in the slot and he had little<br />\ntrouble beating Bowyer for a 3-3<br />\ntie.

Although<br />\nDickinson ended the game on the<br />\npower play, after Conrad was<br />\ngiven a roughing penalty and<br />\ngame misconduct, it was Hopkins<br />\nthat came closest to scoring.

This is our first<br />\nyear in division three and we<br />\nwere able to complete with all the<br />\nteams even though some of them<br />\nrecruit.\"<br />\nShe continued,\"We beat Middlebury and Smith and just barely lost to Colby.\" The other two<br />\nteams in the the division, Vassar<br />\nand Tufts, placed one and two in<br />\nthe championships and were<br />\ntougher competitors.<br />\nThe team was at a skill level<br />\ncomparable to the other teams,<br />\nbut Cushman believes that the<br />\nteam was hurt by its short season.<br />\nShe said, \"the other teams play<br />\ntwelve to fifteen tournaments. We<br />\nhave an extremely short season<br />\nand most of our tournaments are<br />\nsmall. This weekend we played<br />\nfive teams and I think the team<br />\nmembers were tired by Sunday.\"<br />\nJessica Tropp agreed. \"We<br />\nwere really tired toward the end<br />\nof the tournament, but we won<br />\nour last match against Smith<br />\nanyway.\"<br />\nCushman added, \"we also<br />\naren't used to playing teams with<br />\nsuch a high level of ability. Our<br />\nteam hasn't had the opportunity<br />\nto develop the mental and<br />\nphysical toughness that we need<br />\nto win against challenging<br />\ncompetitors.\"<br /><br />\nKeep your friends and<br />\nrelatives well-informed\u2014and<br />\ntheir birdcages well-lined.<br />\nMail subscriptions to the<br />\nNews-Letter:<br />\nOnly $35 per year!<br /><br />\nSome of the Hopkins team<br />\nmembers did manage to do extremely well in the tournament.<br />\nNatasha Dupont, in the number<br />\nthree position, won all but one of<br />\nher matches. Her only loss, to<br />\nVassar, was in the fifth and final<br />\ngame.<br />\nKarran Phillips, in the number<br />\nfour position, turned in a great<br />\nperformance. She also won four<br />\nof her five matches. In the four<br />\nmatches she won, she only gave<br />\nup one game to an opponent.<br />\nAimee Machado, the number<br />\neight player, also contributed by<br />\nonly losing one match. She easily beat three of her opponents in<br />\nthree straight games. Christina<br />\nvon Riesenfelder also did well<br />\nand won three of her five games.<br />\nTara Dorr and Jessica Tropp<br />\nplayed in the number one and<br />\nnumber two positions, respectively. Many of the division three<br />\nteams recruit and many of the top<br />\nranked players are excellent<br /><br />\nsquash players. As a result both<br />\nof the top ranked Hopkins players<br />\nhad a hard time at the tournament. Cushman commented, \"I<br />\nknow they had a tough time, but<br />\nat this level most of the other<br />\nschools have one or two incredible competitors.\"<br />\nThe team's elevation to division three allows them to send<br />\ntwo players to the National Intercollegiate Singles Championship<br />\nin March. Dorr and Tropp will<br />\nautomatically get invited to the<br />\ncompetition because of their<br />\nranking within the team. The<br />\nCushmans are also hoping to obtain invitations for either Dupont<br />\nof Phillips.<br />\nThe team is only losing one<br />\nsenior, Glynnis Dales, to graduation and Jill Litt will be abroad<br />\nnext year. Cushman commented,<br />\n\"most of the team should return<br />\nnext year.

By<br />\ndominating them so thoroughly,<br />\nthe Hopkins fencers proved that<br />\nthey are the true conference<br />\npowerhouses. Robert McLay and<br />\nPeter Kim dominated William<br />\nand Mary sabre competitors. In<br />\nthe epee division, Jorge Gana had<br />\na perfect weekend (6-0), and<br />\nJason Coleman (4-2) was extremely solid. The most pleasant<br />\nsurprise, though, was supplied by<br />\nsophomore Ronnie Spring (5-1).<br />\n\"Spring was forced into action<br /><br />\nbecause of Mike Fleisher's<br />\nsprained knee, and he gave a very<br />\ngood account of himself,\" said<br />\nOles. \"Everyone came through.\"<br />\nAs the sabre and epee teams<br />\nwere establishing themselves, the<br />\nfoil squad just continued rolling<br />\nalong. \"We're 51-3 the last two<br />\nweeks,\" stated foil captain<br />\nRichard Millhiser, who contributed a 5-0 record this<br />\nweekend.
