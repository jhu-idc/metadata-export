He was joined by Dr.<br />\nJames Deese of Psychology, Dr.<br />\nSigmond Suskind of Biology, Dr.<br />\nJeffrey Gassman of Romance<br />\nLanguages and Dr. Henry Mark<br />\nof the Medical School.<br />\nDr. Barker stressed the fact<br />\nthat this was a spontaneous<br />\nmovement both in its origins<br />\nand its growth. Thus, at Homewood, one person circulated the<br />\npetition by personal contact<br />\nand campus mail among the<br />\nmembers of his department.<br />\nAccording to those involved,<br />\nno pressure of any kind was<br />\nbrought to bear by those circulating the petition on their colleagues. Dr. Barker admitted<br />\nthat these methods had their<br />\nweaknesses, but felt that a different approach would have<br />\ngiven an entirely different air<br />\nto the movement.<br />\nConcerning the results, Dr.<br />\nGossman, who was responsible<br />\nfor Romance Languages and in<br />\npart for all the Humanities, was<br />\n\"disappointed yet pleased.\"<br />\nThe ad's statement was termed by Dr. River of Romance<br />\nLanguages \"the lowest common<br />\n<br />\ndenominator\" with which as<br />\nmany as possible could agree.<br />\nThis was confirmed by interviews with other faculty members. Dr. Barker felt that \"the<br />\nwar has outrun common sense,\"<br />\nand that the President has not<br />\ndone much for the cause of<br />\npeace. \"This war is terribly inhumane and is a blot on our<br />\nhistory.\"<br />\nOf the ad's statement Dr.<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum of the<br />\nPhilosophy department said \"I<br />\nbelieve in it\" but that it, embodied the maximum of his ideas<br />\nfor action to be taken. Dr. Suskind said \"Time should be given<br />\nfor people to do some kind of<br />\nnegotiating while free from the<br />\nimmediate pressure of conflict,\"<br />\nand feels that Gen. Gavin's 'enclave theory' is \"not unrealistic.\"<br />\n<br />\nProf. Hunt of Geography felt<br />\nthat what needs to be followed<br />\nis a neutral position such as<br />\nU Thant's; for Americans, split<br />\nover the war, are either biased<br />\nin their views or frustrated over<br />\ntheir efforts. Dr. Hartmann of<br />\nBiology sees two groups offering<br />\ntwo choices to this country. Both<br />\nagree that we should get out,<br />\nbut one group wants to decimate<br />\nViet Nam first while the other<br />\nwants to \u2022 get out first. Opting<br />\nfor the latter, he sees the problem as \"just get people together. . . Everyone has said they<br />\nwill go to the peace table.\" He<br />\nfeels that a good place to start<br />\nis the halting of the \"ineffective<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nexpensive\" bombing, yet -he<br />\nand<br />\neditorial<br />\nstrong<br />\nto<br />\nHowever, due<br />\nthe Pensupport from the local Baltimore suspects some people in<br />\npress and personal support from<br />\nMayor McKeldin, Mr. Lee has<br />\nbeen able to stay. The mayor's<br />\npressure secured from Lee's landlord a pledge to allow the store<br />\nto remain in his building and he<br />\npromised police protection.<br />\nAccording to Lee, the insurance company handling the landlord's fire policy and the landlord were harassed by phone calls<br />\nfrom the wives of the Klan members demanding the eviction of<br />\nLee and his bookshop.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun, on March<br />\n22, wrote \"If a bookstore bows to<br />\nhoodlum attacks. Baltimore itself<br />\nbows, and a failure to defend a<br />\nbookseller's rights can encourage<br />\nattacks on other bookstores,<br />\nlibraries, colleges, and all places<br />\nwhere freedom of expression is<br />\nnourished.\"<br />\nMr. Lee, a World War II veteran who has run the store Since<br />\n1962, has been an activist since<br />\nthe end of the war. In 1945, he<br />\nchaired the \"Veteran Citizen's<br />\nCommittee to Oust Bilbo,\" a senator from Mississippi, and an<br />\nalleged racist.<br />\n<br />\nBookshop<br />\nAttacked<br />\n<br />\ntagon of \"wanting to go all the<br />\nway to China,\" and sees this end<br />\nas a reality if the present process<br />\nof escalation is continued. He<br />\nalso feels that the cause of peace<br />\nis impeded by Premier Ky's refusal to talk with the Viet Cong.<br />\nOthers went beyond the published statement. Dr. Deese said<br />\n\"I think this war is a strategic<br />\ndisaster for the U.S.\" Opposing<br />\nthe war and general warfare on<br />\nhumanitarian grounds, he continued, \"from the standpoint of<br />\nadvantages to the U.S. and to<br />\nhumanitarianism, the sooner we<br />\nbring this war to an end, the<br />\nbetter, by almost any means and<br />\non almost any grounds.\"<br />\nDr. River views it as a \"constitutionally and internationally<br />\nillegal war.\" Since it is the President's war, all possible pressure<br />\nshould be brought to bear on<br />\nhim to change his policies, he<br />\nfeels. 'Dr. Gossrnan expressed<br />\ngrave concern not only with \"all<br />\nthe suffering\" but also with the<br />\nAdministration's rebuffs to and<br />\nundermining of peace gestures<br />\nand proposals; and with the<br />\nthreat to democracy posed by<br />\nthe 'credibility gap.' He stated<br />\n\"The principle of a well-informed electorate is essential to a<br />\nworking democracy.\" He questioned the theory that we must<br />\nfight communism wherever it<br />\nappears and, going still further:<br />\n\"Even if one accepts this<br />\npremise, I question the validity<br />\nof this war.\" Prof. Vannier of<br />\nRomance Languages said simply \"I feel it is a mild statement.\"<br />\n<br />\nThis year's Spring Weekend<br />\nwill feature two accomplished<br />\ngroups.

The spring cat<br />\nis among us, and with him the growls of a winter of<br />\ndiscontent as well. Bananas, riots at Lauderdale, anti the<br />\nbe-ins. But these are just growls for the sake of hearing<br />\nones own sound\u2014there are other growls that bear looking into.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees at Columbia University voted<br />\nthis past week to abolish an archaic remnant of graduate school requirements--class standing. In making the<br />\ndecision, the trustees of that university cited the use of<br />\nclass standings by draft boards, and the refusal of Columbia's administration to divulge class standing, as unauthorized trips into the political field. Political implications aside, this action of abolishing class standing has<br />\ngreater ramifications in the academic world. Columbia<br />\nis the first major school in the country to make this step.<br />\nHaverford College previously voted to do away with<br />\nclass ranking, and Bennington and Sarah Lawrence have<br />\ndropped grading systems as well as class standing. Princeton last year initiated a program of having one course<br />\neach term treated on the pass-fail scale. Goucher students also have this option.<br />\nIt appears to 'us that in view of the recent activity<br />\nin reforming grading systems in higher education, there<br />\nshould be serious thought given to changes in the current undergraduate ranking procedure at Hopkins. Entering into such a study would take one into the intricacies of the philosophy and psychology of grading in<br />\nthe abstract, a discussion we will not enter into here.'<br />\nSuffice to say that consideration should he given to dropping class ranking as such and instituting, on a trial basis,<br />\na pass-fail system. We hope both the academic circles<br />\nand the administration of Hopkins will not ignore their<br />\ntradition of innovation in considering any grade system<br />\nchanges.<br />\nSeveral growls have been heard in the jungle of student affairs in the past few weeks that also require<br />\ncomment.<br />\nThe S.D.S. report on the University requirement of<br />\nfreshmen living in dormitories has elicited little, if any,<br />\nreaction from the administration, at which it was aimed.<br />\nThe report proposes a four point change in the current<br />\nadministration policy that would lead to an abolishment<br />\nof the present rule. The University's policy, thrown out<br />\non various disciplinary occasions, takes a view of the<br />\nHopkins student as an adult, to be given all the privileges (apparently freedom) as well as the responsibilities<br />\n(apparently responsibility). If this philosophy is to be<br />\napplied consistently, it appears to us that the freshman<br />\ndormitory rule is contradictory. Does Hokins mold men<br />\nin the space of one year? We doubt it, and we also doubt<br />\nwhether being forced to live in the dormitories- helps<br />\nmatters.<br />\nThe Student Council has submitted a budget that<br />\nexceeds that of previous years by a healthy sum in tight<br />\nfisted Hopkins' standards. The budget is merely a reflection of the Student Council's largely expanded services<br />\nthis year. Included in the new budget would be allocations for the course guide, the discount card system,<br />\nand a lecture series. The only item that can be objected to is the proposed, and largely visionary, GoucherHopkins bus service. Improving the relation between the<br />\nsexes, or even between the two schools we do not view as<br />\nin the area of the Council's omnipotent authority, much<br />\nless concern. With the exception of this item we recommend that the budget be excepted.<br />\nA final growl comes from the direction of the<br />\nHomewood field. The growls are heard every Saturday,<br />\nand they are joyous sounds. We wish the lacrosse team<br />\nfurther growls as the season goes on.<br />\n<br />\nBy GERALD BRECHER<br />\nWe received a communication<br />\nfrom a friend at Goucher last<br />\nv,eek containing a clipping about<br />\na national organization called the<br />\nof<br />\nCommittee<br />\nResponsibility.<br />\nThis Committee seeks to bring<br />\nupwards of one hundred Vietnamese children to this country,<br />\nand with the aid of the medical<br />\nfacilities available here, seeks to<br />\nrepair the damage done to these<br />\nchildren by our military operations in Vietnam. Those involved<br />\nhere in Baltimore include several<br />\neminent members of the Faculty<br />\nof the Medical Institutions;<br />\nplastic surgeons, pediatricians<br />\nand others whose concern with<br />\ndoing something about the present consequences of our involvement in Vietnam goes beyond extravagant talk.<br />\nEnough rhetoric is blown<br />\naround about this war to last at<br />\nleast five more years of fighting<br />\neven if no one was to write another word. Student protest, as<br />\nis the case with just about all<br />\nother protest, contains as its<br />\nchief ingredient the same hot air,<br />\nthe same tedious collections of<br />\ncliches and dragged out reasoning, the same over-involvement in<br />\nthe sound of one's own words. If<br />\none must protest I would suggest that burnt babies make a<br />\nmore emphatic point. And the<br />\npoint is not merely that burnt<br />\nchildren are useful items in a<br />\npropaganda campaign, but that<br />\ndoing something about burnt children is somehow a less smug and<br />\nmore humane approach to the entire Vietnamese misfortune than<br />\nsimplistic ideologies\u2014either for<br />\nthe war or against it.<br />\nPolitics Beside the Point<br />\nThe political conflict is not up<br />\nfor argument here. It would seem<br />\n<br />\nthat the care and treatment of<br />\nburnt children is something that<br />\ngoes beyond one's convictions<br />\nabout the relative merits of the<br />\nwar. Discerning anyone's stake in<br />\nthis war is difficult enough\u2014certainly the Vietnamese themselves<br />\nare pretty much unaware of what<br />\ntheirs is\u2014ours is at best as unclear. But we are doing other<br />\nthings in Vietnam than killing<br />\nCommunists. And among the<br />\nthings we are doing is causing<br />\nchildren to be burned quite<br />\nseverely by the napalm bombs we<br />\ndrop on these children's villages.<br />\nAnd if the civilians in the United<br />\nStates cannot understand the political stakes being fought over,<br />\nit is shameful that there is not a<br />\nmore widely held feeling of involvement with the present consequences of this war.<br />\nWe hear a surfeit of talk about<br />\nprotecting the future of freedom<br />\nin Vietnam. Yet it would seem<br />\nthat the future of the Vietnamese<br />\nis in severe doubt no matter who<br />\nis triumphant in the military action. And even if we do find some<br />\nway to bring peace and freedom<br />\nto the people of Vietnam, what<br />\ngood will it do them if their<br />\ncountry is populated chiefly by<br />\ncripples and burnt-out children?<br />\nOur stake in this unfortunate conflict at present can involve nothing more pressing than the most<br />\neffective rehabilitation of those<br />\ncivilians whose lives have been<br />\ntransformed by our peace-seeking<br />\nmilitary operations. If our impressive<br />\nweaponry must be<br />\nturned upon the Vietnamese civilians as well as upon our armed<br />\nadversaries, then we ought at<br />\nleast to have the simple grace<br />\nand decency to do more afterward than merely mop up the<br />\nblood.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n.It's pointless to go into the<br />\nmorality of using napalm. War<br />\ndoes not seem to me to be the<br />\nproper place for arguments of<br />\nthe relativity of morality. Is napalm any more immoral than a<br />\nhand grenade? One is just as<br />\ndead in either case. By the same<br />\ntoken, in view of the existing military situation, it is just as useless to engage in polemics about<br />\nthe morality destroying civilians.<br />\nGeneral Sherman had the last<br />\nwords about that a hundred years<br />\nago. But whether war is hell or<br />\nnot is not the issue here. If it<br />\nmust be hell, let those who can<br />\nmake the effort do what they can<br />\nto make it less hellish after the<br />\nsoldiers get through their day's<br />\nwork.<br />\nGovernment Subsidy?<br />\nThis country does possess the<br />\nmedical facilities and apparently<br />\nit posseses enough willing physicians to make more than just a<br />\ntoken gesture toward the treatment of burned Vietnamese children. It is unfortunate that the<br />\ngovernment does not undertake<br />\nto subsidize such a program on a<br />\nmuch larger basis.<br />\nIf nothing else then, this is our<br />\nstake in Vietnam: the repair of<br />\nour own wanton damage. Whether the war is worth fighting\u2014or<br />\nwinning\u2014is for the moment not<br />\nthe point. That's a question that<br />\nis at best untimely. But if the<br />\nnational conscience is not involved in the suffering of children at our hands \u2014 children<br />\nwhose lives we are pledged to defend\u2014then there is a certain<br />\nquestion as to whether it exists<br />\nat all. Apparently at Goucher<br />\nthere is a group set up to support<br />\nthe efforts of the Committee of<br />\nResponsibility. Perhaps some of<br />\nyou might be interested.<br />\n<br />\nFilms<br />\n<br />\nBrain Eaters And Others<br />\nBy CHARLES VERMONT<br />\nAt forty, Roger Corman is one<br />\nof Hollywood's most prolific directors. Between 1954 and 1966<br />\nhe made seventy films of which<br />\nall but two or three raked in<br />\nprofit but not much honor. The<br />\ndirector of such drive-in favorites<br />\nas Machine Gun Kelly, Gunslinger, Apache Woman, Oklahoma<br />\nWoman, The Brain Eaters, The<br />\nUndead Dementia 13, The Saga<br />\nof the Viking Women and Their<br />\nVoyage to the Waters of the<br />\nGreat Sea Serpent, and The Wild<br />\nAngels, has not until recently won<br />\nthe acclaim of critics who seemed<br />\nto have refused to review films<br />\nwhose titles mark them as eminently commercial. But in the<br />\n<br />\npast few years Corman has been<br />\nrecognized as a great artist, especially in Europe where he has<br />\nbeen honored with several awards<br />\nand a festival of his Poe films at<br />\nthe French Film Institute. He has<br />\nbeen dubbed \"The Orson Welles<br />\nof Grade Z Films,\" and has been<br />\nenshrined with America's cinematic greats; Griffith, Chaplin,<br />\nHitchcock.<br />\nCorman has more than survived in Hollywood because his<br />\nfilms cost less than anyone else's,<br />\nare shot in record time, and turn<br />\nout to be box-office winners. Corman's commercial appeal is directed mostly toward teenagers.<br />\nHorror films, science fiction,<br />\nvvesterns, and adolescent thrillers<br />\n<br />\nlike Wild Angels keep the money<br />\nrolling in. At the same time film<br />\nbuffs and scholars have been attracted to Corman because of<br />\nhis poetic mastery of the film<br />\nmedium and his self-conscious<br />\nartistic approach.<br />\nCorman fills out his narratives<br />\nby giving them a Freudian reading. His artistic credo is: Never<br />\nshow reality. \"If a man must<br />\ntravel over land, use land that<br />\nhas been burned in a forest fire.<br />\nPreferably, he should journey<br />\nover water, because water has a<br />\ndreamlike quality. And there<br />\nmust always be fog and fire.

The book has an excellent chance of becoming the<br />\nlast word on the Johnsonian<br />\nera (circa 37-47 anno Ginsberg),<br />\na time normally neglected by<br />\nmost serious students of the<br />\nempire.<br />\nThe book begins with a brief<br />\ndescription of Johnson II's rise<br />\nto power. Born in a semi-civilized region of the empire, Johnson II gained power in a long,<br />\ndirty battle first in local politics<br />\nand eventually in the still-influential Senate. At last appointed<br />\nco-emperor by Kennedy I in 34<br />\nA.G., Johnson II ascended to the<br />\nthrone with the assassination of<br />\n37 A.G.<br />\nAt this point in the narrative,<br />\nthe general preciseness of The<br />\nReign of Johnson Ii is visibly<br />\n<br />\ndisturbed. 8053 is not alone<br />\namong historians in his being<br />\nconfused about the motives and<br />\nmethods of the assassination of<br />\n37 A.G. Perhaps we shall never<br />\nknow what happened on the<br />\nIdes of November. After a painstaking analysis of the recently<br />\ndiscovered Warren Commission<br />\nReport, 8053 can only conclude<br />\nthat the report's vagueness and<br />\ninconsistancies tend to show<br />\nthat the document was probably<br />\nan elaborately constructed satire<br />\nof the real investigation report,<br />\na document yet to be discovered.<br />\nFortunately, 8053 wastes few<br />\npages on the assassination. He<br />\ngoes on to give an excellent description of the world of Johnson<br />\nIn 37 A.G. the word of the<br />\nemperor was law in the Western<br />\nHemisphere, Eastern Asia, and<br />\nWester n Europe.

The<br />\nancient empires of Europe were<br />\ntemporarily weakened, the Soviet empire had been stalemated<br />\nand the Asian hordes were still<br />\ntoo weak and disorganized to<br />\nthreaten the empire's borders.<br />\nThe American legions were still<br />\nloyal to the emperor and were<br />\napparently an invincible fighting force.<br />\nHowever, even during this apparent highpoint in its development, 8053 points out signs of<br />\nthe growing weaknesses that<br />\neventually led to the empire's<br />\ndecline. In 39 A.G., for instance,<br />\nJohnson II found himself escalating an apparently pointless<br />\nwar of expansion in Southeast<br />\n<br />\nAsia.

He qualified this by<br />\npointing out that outspoken political actors face the threat of<br />\nboycott and that T.V. news conferences and other campaign<br />\ncoverage will readily serve to<br />\nuncover \"phonies\" who are<br />\ntotally the product of their PR.<br />\nmen.<br />\nMr. Linkletter voiced support<br />\nfor the war in Viet-nam, although he felt we made a mistake in originally committing<br />\nourselves.

He was in<br />\nfavor of tuition at state universities and colleges, and advocated expelling those students<br />\nwho repeatedly broke state and<br />\nuniversity laws.

He was joined by Dr.<br />\nJames Deese of Psychology, Dr.<br />\nSigmond Suskind of Biology, Dr.<br />\nJeffrey Gassman of Romance<br />\nLanguages and Dr. Henry Mark<br />\nof the Medical School.<br />\nDr. Barker stressed the fact<br />\nthat this was a spontaneous<br />\nmovement both in its origins<br />\nand its growth. Thus, at Homewood, one person circulated the<br />\npetition by personal contact<br />\nand campus mail among the<br />\nmembers of his department.<br />\nAccording to those involved,<br />\nno pressure of any kind was<br />\nbrought to bear by those circulating the petition on their colleagues. Dr. Barker admitted<br />\nthat these methods had their<br />\nweaknesses, but felt that a different approach would have<br />\ngiven an entirely different air<br />\nto the movement.<br />\nConcerning the results, Dr.<br />\nGossman, who was responsible<br />\nfor Romance Languages and in<br />\npart for all the Humanities, was<br />\n\"disappointed yet pleased.\"<br />\nThe ad's statement was termed by Dr. River of Romance<br />\nLanguages \"the lowest common<br /><br />\ndenominator\" with which as<br />\nmany as possible could agree.<br />\nThis was confirmed by interviews with other faculty members. Dr. Barker felt that \"the<br />\nwar has outrun common sense,\"<br />\nand that the President has not<br />\ndone much for the cause of<br />\npeace. \"This war is terribly inhumane and is a blot on our<br />\nhistory.\"<br />\nOf the ad's statement Dr.<br />\nMaurice Mandelbaum of the<br />\nPhilosophy department said \"I<br />\nbelieve in it\" but that it, embodied the maximum of his ideas<br />\nfor action to be taken. Dr. Suskind said \"Time should be given<br />\nfor people to do some kind of<br />\nnegotiating while free from the<br />\nimmediate pressure of conflict,\"<br />\nand feels that Gen. Gavin's 'enclave theory' is \"not unrealistic.\"<br /><br />\nProf. Hunt of Geography felt<br />\nthat what needs to be followed<br />\nis a neutral position such as<br />\nU Thant's; for Americans, split<br />\nover the war, are either biased<br />\nin their views or frustrated over<br />\ntheir efforts. Dr. Hartmann of<br />\nBiology sees two groups offering<br />\ntwo choices to this country. Both<br />\nagree that we should get out,<br />\nbut one group wants to decimate<br />\nViet Nam first while the other<br />\nwants to \u2022 get out first. Opting<br />\nfor the latter, he sees the problem as \"just get people together. . . Everyone has said they<br />\nwill go to the peace table.\" He<br />\nfeels that a good place to start<br />\nis the halting of the \"ineffective<br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nexpensive\" bombing, yet -he<br />\nand<br />\neditorial<br />\nstrong<br />\nto<br />\nHowever, due<br />\nthe Pensupport from the local Baltimore suspects some people in<br />\npress and personal support from<br />\nMayor McKeldin, Mr. Lee has<br />\nbeen able to stay. The mayor's<br />\npressure secured from Lee's landlord a pledge to allow the store<br />\nto remain in his building and he<br />\npromised police protection.<br />\nAccording to Lee, the insurance company handling the landlord's fire policy and the landlord were harassed by phone calls<br />\nfrom the wives of the Klan members demanding the eviction of<br />\nLee and his bookshop.<br />\nThe Baltimore Sun, on March<br />\n22, wrote \"If a bookstore bows to<br />\nhoodlum attacks. Baltimore itself<br />\nbows, and a failure to defend a<br />\nbookseller's rights can encourage<br />\nattacks on other bookstores,<br />\nlibraries, colleges, and all places<br />\nwhere freedom of expression is<br />\nnourished.\"<br />\nMr. Lee, a World War II veteran who has run the store Since<br />\n1962, has been an activist since<br />\nthe end of the war. In 1945, he<br />\nchaired the \"Veteran Citizen's<br />\nCommittee to Oust Bilbo,\" a senator from Mississippi, and an<br />\nalleged racist.<br /><br />\nBookshop<br />\nAttacked<br /><br />\ntagon of \"wanting to go all the<br />\nway to China,\" and sees this end<br />\nas a reality if the present process<br />\nof escalation is continued. He<br />\nalso feels that the cause of peace<br />\nis impeded by Premier Ky's refusal to talk with the Viet Cong.<br />\nOthers went beyond the published statement. Dr. Deese said<br />\n\"I think this war is a strategic<br />\ndisaster for the U.S.\" Opposing<br />\nthe war and general warfare on<br />\nhumanitarian grounds, he continued, \"from the standpoint of<br />\nadvantages to the U.S. and to<br />\nhumanitarianism, the sooner we<br />\nbring this war to an end, the<br />\nbetter, by almost any means and<br />\non almost any grounds.\"<br />\nDr. River views it as a \"constitutionally and internationally<br />\nillegal war.\" Since it is the President's war, all possible pressure<br />\nshould be brought to bear on<br />\nhim to change his policies, he<br />\nfeels. 'Dr. Gossrnan expressed<br />\ngrave concern not only with \"all<br />\nthe suffering\" but also with the<br />\nAdministration's rebuffs to and<br />\nundermining of peace gestures<br />\nand proposals; and with the<br />\nthreat to democracy posed by<br />\nthe 'credibility gap.' He stated<br />\n\"The principle of a well-informed electorate is essential to a<br />\nworking democracy.\" He questioned the theory that we must<br />\nfight communism wherever it<br />\nappears and, going still further:<br />\n\"Even if one accepts this<br />\npremise, I question the validity<br />\nof this war.\" Prof. Vannier of<br />\nRomance Languages said simply \"I feel it is a mild statement.\"<br /><br />\nThis year's Spring Weekend<br />\nwill feature two accomplished<br />\ngroups.

But these are just growls for the sake of hearing<br />\nones own sound\u2014there are other growls that bear looking into.<br />\nThe Board of Trustees at Columbia University voted<br />\nthis past week to abolish an archaic remnant of graduate school requirements--class standing. In making the<br />\ndecision, the trustees of that university cited the use of<br />\nclass standings by draft boards, and the refusal of Columbia's administration to divulge class standing, as unauthorized trips into the political field. Political implications aside, this action of abolishing class standing has<br />\ngreater ramifications in the academic world. Columbia<br />\nis the first major school in the country to make this step.<br />\nHaverford College previously voted to do away with<br />\nclass ranking, and Bennington and Sarah Lawrence have<br />\ndropped grading systems as well as class standing. Princeton last year initiated a program of having one course<br />\neach term treated on the pass-fail scale. Goucher students also have this option.<br />\nIt appears to 'us that in view of the recent activity<br />\nin reforming grading systems in higher education, there<br />\nshould be serious thought given to changes in the current undergraduate ranking procedure at Hopkins. Entering into such a study would take one into the intricacies of the philosophy and psychology of grading in<br />\nthe abstract, a discussion we will not enter into here.'<br />\nSuffice to say that consideration should he given to dropping class ranking as such and instituting, on a trial basis,<br />\na pass-fail system. We hope both the academic circles<br />\nand the administration of Hopkins will not ignore their<br />\ntradition of innovation in considering any grade system<br />\nchanges.<br />\nSeveral growls have been heard in the jungle of student affairs in the past few weeks that also require<br />\ncomment.<br />\nThe S.D.S. report on the University requirement of<br />\nfreshmen living in dormitories has elicited little, if any,<br />\nreaction from the administration, at which it was aimed.<br />\nThe report proposes a four point change in the current<br />\nadministration policy that would lead to an abolishment<br />\nof the present rule. The University's policy, thrown out<br />\non various disciplinary occasions, takes a view of the<br />\nHopkins student as an adult, to be given all the privileges (apparently freedom) as well as the responsibilities<br />\n(apparently responsibility). If this philosophy is to be<br />\napplied consistently, it appears to us that the freshman<br />\ndormitory rule is contradictory. Does Hokins mold men<br />\nin the space of one year? We doubt it, and we also doubt<br />\nwhether being forced to live in the dormitories- helps<br />\nmatters.<br />\nThe Student Council has submitted a budget that<br />\nexceeds that of previous years by a healthy sum in tight<br />\nfisted Hopkins' standards. The budget is merely a reflection of the Student Council's largely expanded services<br />\nthis year. Included in the new budget would be allocations for the course guide, the discount card system,<br />\nand a lecture series. The only item that can be objected to is the proposed, and largely visionary, GoucherHopkins bus service. Improving the relation between the<br />\nsexes, or even between the two schools we do not view as<br />\nin the area of the Council's omnipotent authority, much<br />\nless concern.

Those involved<br />\nhere in Baltimore include several<br />\neminent members of the Faculty<br />\nof the Medical Institutions;<br />\nplastic surgeons, pediatricians<br />\nand others whose concern with<br />\ndoing something about the present consequences of our involvement in Vietnam goes beyond extravagant talk.<br />\nEnough rhetoric is blown<br />\naround about this war to last at<br />\nleast five more years of fighting<br />\neven if no one was to write another word. Student protest, as<br />\nis the case with just about all<br />\nother protest, contains as its<br />\nchief ingredient the same hot air,<br />\nthe same tedious collections of<br />\ncliches and dragged out reasoning, the same over-involvement in<br />\nthe sound of one's own words. If<br />\none must protest I would suggest that burnt babies make a<br />\nmore emphatic point. And the<br />\npoint is not merely that burnt<br />\nchildren are useful items in a<br />\npropaganda campaign, but that<br />\ndoing something about burnt children is somehow a less smug and<br />\nmore humane approach to the entire Vietnamese misfortune than<br />\nsimplistic ideologies\u2014either for<br />\nthe war or against it.<br />\nPolitics Beside the Point<br />\nThe political conflict is not up<br />\nfor argument here. It would seem<br /><br />\nthat the care and treatment of<br />\nburnt children is something that<br />\ngoes beyond one's convictions<br />\nabout the relative merits of the<br />\nwar. Discerning anyone's stake in<br />\nthis war is difficult enough\u2014certainly the Vietnamese themselves<br />\nare pretty much unaware of what<br />\ntheirs is\u2014ours is at best as unclear. But we are doing other<br />\nthings in Vietnam than killing<br />\nCommunists. And among the<br />\nthings we are doing is causing<br />\nchildren to be burned quite<br />\nseverely by the napalm bombs we<br />\ndrop on these children's villages.<br />\nAnd if the civilians in the United<br />\nStates cannot understand the political stakes being fought over,<br />\nit is shameful that there is not a<br />\nmore widely held feeling of involvement with the present consequences of this war.<br />\nWe hear a surfeit of talk about<br />\nprotecting the future of freedom<br />\nin Vietnam. Yet it would seem<br />\nthat the future of the Vietnamese<br />\nis in severe doubt no matter who<br />\nis triumphant in the military action. And even if we do find some<br />\nway to bring peace and freedom<br />\nto the people of Vietnam, what<br />\ngood will it do them if their<br />\ncountry is populated chiefly by<br />\ncripples and burnt-out children?<br />\nOur stake in this unfortunate conflict at present can involve nothing more pressing than the most<br />\neffective rehabilitation of those<br />\ncivilians whose lives have been<br />\ntransformed by our peace-seeking<br />\nmilitary operations. If our impressive<br />\nweaponry must be<br />\nturned upon the Vietnamese civilians as well as upon our armed<br />\nadversaries, then we ought at<br />\nleast to have the simple grace<br />\nand decency to do more afterward than merely mop up the<br />\nblood.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n.It's pointless to go into the<br />\nmorality of using napalm. War<br />\ndoes not seem to me to be the<br />\nproper place for arguments of<br />\nthe relativity of morality. Is napalm any more immoral than a<br />\nhand grenade? One is just as<br />\ndead in either case. By the same<br />\ntoken, in view of the existing military situation, it is just as useless to engage in polemics about<br />\nthe morality destroying civilians.<br />\nGeneral Sherman had the last<br />\nwords about that a hundred years<br />\nago. But whether war is hell or<br />\nnot is not the issue here. If it<br />\nmust be hell, let those who can<br />\nmake the effort do what they can<br />\nto make it less hellish after the<br />\nsoldiers get through their day's<br />\nwork.<br />\nGovernment Subsidy?<br />\nThis country does possess the<br />\nmedical facilities and apparently<br />\nit posseses enough willing physicians to make more than just a<br />\ntoken gesture toward the treatment of burned Vietnamese children. It is unfortunate that the<br />\ngovernment does not undertake<br />\nto subsidize such a program on a<br />\nmuch larger basis.<br />\nIf nothing else then, this is our<br />\nstake in Vietnam: the repair of<br />\nour own wanton damage. Whether the war is worth fighting\u2014or<br />\nwinning\u2014is for the moment not<br />\nthe point. That's a question that<br />\nis at best untimely. But if the<br />\nnational conscience is not involved in the suffering of children at our hands \u2014 children<br />\nwhose lives we are pledged to defend\u2014then there is a certain<br />\nquestion as to whether it exists<br />\nat all. Apparently at Goucher<br />\nthere is a group set up to support<br />\nthe efforts of the Committee of<br />\nResponsibility.

Between 1954 and 1966<br />\nhe made seventy films of which<br />\nall but two or three raked in<br />\nprofit but not much honor. The<br />\ndirector of such drive-in favorites<br />\nas Machine Gun Kelly, Gunslinger, Apache Woman, Oklahoma<br />\nWoman, The Brain Eaters, The<br />\nUndead Dementia 13, The Saga<br />\nof the Viking Women and Their<br />\nVoyage to the Waters of the<br />\nGreat Sea Serpent, and The Wild<br />\nAngels, has not until recently won<br />\nthe acclaim of critics who seemed<br />\nto have refused to review films<br />\nwhose titles mark them as eminently commercial. But in the<br /><br />\npast few years Corman has been<br />\nrecognized as a great artist, especially in Europe where he has<br />\nbeen honored with several awards<br />\nand a festival of his Poe films at<br />\nthe French Film Institute. He has<br />\nbeen dubbed \"The Orson Welles<br />\nof Grade Z Films,\" and has been<br />\nenshrined with America's cinematic greats; Griffith, Chaplin,<br />\nHitchcock.<br />\nCorman has more than survived in Hollywood because his<br />\nfilms cost less than anyone else's,<br />\nare shot in record time, and turn<br />\nout to be box-office winners. Corman's commercial appeal is directed mostly toward teenagers.<br />\nHorror films, science fiction,<br />\nvvesterns, and adolescent thrillers<br /><br />\nlike Wild Angels keep the money<br />\nrolling in. At the same time film<br />\nbuffs and scholars have been attracted to Corman because of<br />\nhis poetic mastery of the film<br />\nmedium and his self-conscious<br />\nartistic approach.<br />\nCorman fills out his narratives<br />\nby giving them a Freudian reading. His artistic credo is: Never<br />\nshow reality. \"If a man must<br />\ntravel over land, use land that<br />\nhas been burned in a forest fire.<br />\nPreferably, he should journey<br />\nover water, because water has a<br />\ndreamlike quality.

The book has an excellent chance of becoming the<br />\nlast word on the Johnsonian<br />\nera (circa 37-47 anno Ginsberg),<br />\na time normally neglected by<br />\nmost serious students of the<br />\nempire.<br />\nThe book begins with a brief<br />\ndescription of Johnson II's rise<br />\nto power. Born in a semi-civilized region of the empire, Johnson II gained power in a long,<br />\ndirty battle first in local politics<br />\nand eventually in the still-influential Senate. At last appointed<br />\nco-emperor by Kennedy I in 34<br />\nA.G., Johnson II ascended to the<br />\nthrone with the assassination of<br />\n37 A.G.<br />\nAt this point in the narrative,<br />\nthe general preciseness of The<br />\nReign of Johnson Ii is visibly<br /><br />\ndisturbed. 8053 is not alone<br />\namong historians in his being<br />\nconfused about the motives and<br />\nmethods of the assassination of<br />\n37 A.G. Perhaps we shall never<br />\nknow what happened on the<br />\nIdes of November. After a painstaking analysis of the recently<br />\ndiscovered Warren Commission<br />\nReport, 8053 can only conclude<br />\nthat the report's vagueness and<br />\ninconsistancies tend to show<br />\nthat the document was probably<br />\nan elaborately constructed satire<br />\nof the real investigation report,<br />\na document yet to be discovered.<br />\nFortunately, 8053 wastes few<br />\npages on the assassination. He<br />\ngoes on to give an excellent description of the world of Johnson<br />\nIn 37 A.G. the word of the<br />\nemperor was law in the Western<br />\nHemisphere, Eastern Asia, and<br />\nWester n Europe.

The<br />\nancient empires of Europe were<br />\ntemporarily weakened, the Soviet empire had been stalemated<br />\nand the Asian hordes were still<br />\ntoo weak and disorganized to<br />\nthreaten the empire's borders.<br />\nThe American legions were still<br />\nloyal to the emperor and were<br />\napparently an invincible fighting force.<br />\nHowever, even during this apparent highpoint in its development, 8053 points out signs of<br />\nthe growing weaknesses that<br />\neventually led to the empire's<br />\ndecline. In 39 A.G., for instance,<br />\nJohnson II found himself escalating an apparently pointless<br />\nwar of expansion in Southeast<br /><br />\nAsia.
