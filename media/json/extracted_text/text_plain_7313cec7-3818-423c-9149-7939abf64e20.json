He says that our habil<br />\nof playing nonentities from other States leads the Baltimore<br />\npublic to ignore our team. He suggests a schedule comprised<br />\nof State teams only, and predicts a large attendance at the<br />\ngames with these institutions. A sort of Maryland Conference, is the gist of his article.<br />\n.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER shakes in its shoes when it ventures to<br />\ncontradict Mr. W. R. Hearst's highly paid sporting expert. He<br />\nshould, and probably does, \"know his oats\" when sports are in<br />\nquesiton. Nevertheless, we disagree.<br />\nIt is true that a little more interest might be aroused by<br />\ngames with Western Maryland, Mt. St. Mary's, Washington,<br />\nand perhaps Loyola. It is admitted, however, that the athletic<br />\n\u2022code of some of these institutions is rather lax, and this is the<br />\nfirst objection to such contests. And in the second place, we<br />\ndo not believe that the Baltimore public will patronize Hopkins games, or, for that matter, the games of any other State<br />\ncollege, with any degree of interest, no matter who is the opponent. Baltimoreans are not interested in their own institutions; half of the population think that the Hopkins' teams<br />\nare composed of doctors and medical students; they are ignorant of the existence of any other department of the University.<br />\n,This apathy to home institutions will always keep the crowds<br />\ndown to a small size.<br />\nFor the same reason that Baltimore could not support big<br />\nleague baseball, for the same reaison that_it_does not _support<br />\nany first-class teams in any sport,\u2014for that reason, whatever<br />\nit is, it will not flock to Hopkins' football games, no matter<br />\nhow high a brand of sport is presented.<br />\nThis, in short, is why we differ with the learned Mr.<br />\nMathews. And we believe that it is better to play gentlemen<br />\nfrom out-State colleges than gentlemen from in-State schools<br />\nwith no reputation.<br />\nHowever, to be constructively critical, we would suggest<br />\ngames with teams of the class of Virginia, Washington and<br />\nLee, Swarthmore, and North Carolina.

There was much surprise at the result of the game.<br />\nbut much more surprise at the smallness of the crowd.<br />\nStarr Mathews, writing in the A i\u00bbcrican. attributes the size<br />\nof the crowd to the Hopkins' schedule. He says that our habil<br />\nof playing nonentities from other States leads the Baltimore<br />\npublic to ignore our team. He suggests a schedule comprised<br />\nof State teams only, and predicts a large attendance at the<br />\ngames with these institutions. A sort of Maryland Conference, is the gist of his article.<br />\n.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER shakes in its shoes when it ventures to<br />\ncontradict Mr. W. R. Hearst's highly paid sporting expert. He<br />\nshould, and probably does, \"know his oats\" when sports are in<br />\nquesiton. Nevertheless, we disagree.<br />\nIt is true that a little more interest might be aroused by<br />\ngames with Western Maryland, Mt. St. Mary's, Washington,<br />\nand perhaps Loyola. It is admitted, however, that the athletic<br />\n\u2022code of some of these institutions is rather lax, and this is the<br />\nfirst objection to such contests. And in the second place, we<br />\ndo not believe that the Baltimore public will patronize Hopkins games, or, for that matter, the games of any other State<br />\ncollege, with any degree of interest, no matter who is the opponent. Baltimoreans are not interested in their own institutions; half of the population think that the Hopkins' teams<br />\nare composed of doctors and medical students; they are ignorant of the existence of any other department of the University.<br />\n,This apathy to home institutions will always keep the crowds<br />\ndown to a small size.<br />\nFor the same reason that Baltimore could not support big<br />\nleague baseball, for the same reaison that_it_does not _support<br />\nany first-class teams in any sport,\u2014for that reason, whatever<br />\nit is, it will not flock to Hopkins' football games, no matter<br />\nhow high a brand of sport is presented.<br />\nThis, in short, is why we differ with the learned Mr.<br />\nMathews. And we believe that it is better to play gentlemen<br />\nfrom out-State colleges than gentlemen from in-State schools<br />\nwith no reputation.<br />\nHowever, to be constructively critical, we would suggest<br />\ngames with teams of the class of Virginia, Washington and<br />\nLee, Swarthmore, and North Carolina.

And we have rather enjoyed being \"literary\" about<br />\n,collegiate affairs.<br />\nPerhaps the fact that they are easy to write about has led<br />\nus to give too much space to them. There is so much disagreement about the conditions at Hopkins that Yes and No is sure<br />\nto agree perfectly with the feelings and thoughts of someone, and so be literature for that person.<br />\nOf course, there remain other things to be eloquent about.<br />\nIt may be that the editor wants us to be literary about literature.<br />\nThat is not so difficult as it sounds. Granted that we<br />\nmay not know literature when we see it, such is also the case<br />\nwith many of our readers.<br />\nA large part of the art of being considered literary consists in the mere act of writing about writing. The only discretion required is in the choosing of books which the readers<br />\ncannot b'e certain are not \"literature.\"<br />\nAn even more impressive gesture is to print in the column<br />\na few bizarre, insane or empty poems, and to accompany them<br />\nwith serious remarks.
