According<br />\nto HUAC, these people are hardened subversives.<br />\n<br />\norganizations too 'conservative.\"<br />\nThe report draws a strong link<br />\nbetween the black nationalist<br />\nmovement and the possibility of a<br />\nfuture guerilla war in this country.<br />\nThe Communist Party, U.S.A., the<br />\nreport says, supports Negro violence and rioting, but it is opposed<br />\nto the launching of guerilla warfare operations at this time, holding that conditions are not ripe<br />\nfor success, thus raising the question of just what, in the eyes of<br />\nthe committee, constitutes bonafide guerilla warfare.<br />\nHUAC goes on to say that the<br />\n\"key leaders of the Students for a<br />\nDemocratic Society (SDS) have<br />\ngiven open support to guerilla<br />\nwarfare in the United States.\" The<br />\nreport specifically mentions former SDS chief Tom Hayden as a<br />\nproponent of guerilla tactics in<br />\nurban areas.<br />\nThe purpose of the HUAC investigation and the resulting report<br />\nis, according to Rep.

Joe Pool (1).-Tex.), in reference to Title II, Section 100 of<br />\nthe Internal Security Act of 1950,<br />\nwhich served in part as a legal basis for the report, states that \"under a declared state of war, we<br />\ncould get the Attorney General to<br />\nprosecute certain people for sedition and treason . . . Then if they<br />\npersisted in their actions, the Justice Dept. could move to put<br />\nthem into \u2022concentration camps<br />\nand leave them there for the duration of the war.\"<br />\nEduardo Joly, Hopkins SDS<br />\nmember, stated that the report<br />\n\"shows the level of mentality of<br />\nHUAC.\" Stephen Shriver, another<br />\nmember of the Hopkins chapter,<br />\ncomments: \"That such a report<br />\ncan be made under the letterhead<br />\nof the Congress of the United States only serves to reveal the true<br />\nnature of this government.

Columbia, right?<br />\nWrong. Then, perhaps, Cheyney?<br />\nOr Stanford? Or Princeton? No.<br />\nThe Sorbonne, then. Wrong, all<br />\nwrong. The school was Glassboro<br />\nState College of New Jersey. Ever<br />\nheard of it? Think now. Oh yes,<br />\nGSC, made world famous for that<br />\nlong since forgotten Summit<br />\nMeeting of last summer. So how<br />\ncome nobody heard of any rioting<br />\nin New Jersey, if it was such a big<br />\nimportant event?<br />\nThe reason is frightfully simple:<br />\nthere were no riots, no captured<br />\ndeans, no burnings, no militants.<br />\nIncredible - - that it worked, that<br />\nit even happened. The demonstration got very little press; a local<br />\nnewspaper neglected the story<br />\nentirely. A Philadelphia television<br />\nstation gave the story 30 seconds<br />\nof air time. Yet, it is a story that<br />\nshould be heard by this campus,<br />\nits students, faculty, administrators and trustees: the story of the<br />\nmost significant non-violent student demonstration, and because<br />\nof its lack of recognition, perhaps<br />\nthe last.<br />\nThe cause of the disturbance<br />\nwas a long history of total neglect<br />\non the part of a series of state<br />\ngoverments of the educational<br />\nfacilities of New Jersey. There are<br />\nsix State colleges and all are, to<br />\nquote one columnist, \"a mess.\"<br />\nAlthough the State is seventh in<br />\nper capita income, she is 50th in<br />\nper capita expediture for higher<br />\neducation, and until Puerto Rico<br />\nbecomes a State, there she will<br />\nstay.<br />\nThe State has become so lax<br />\nin the area of higher education<br />\nthat she has taken to depending<br />\nupon other States to build facilities, an attitude that so enraged the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan that it set<br />\nup a quota for New. Jersey<br />\nresidents.<br />\nThe schools Jersey does have<br />\nare not even satisfactorally taken<br />\n<br />\ncare of. Glassboro, for example,<br />\ndoes not have enough dormitory<br />\nspace or Classroom facilities. The<br />\nlibrary just got a new second floor,<br />\nbut no books have been purchased<br />\nto fill it. The tuition paid by New<br />\nJersey students does not even go<br />\nto the college, but rather it goes<br />\ninto the State's general fund with<br />\nno guarantee that it will be used<br />\nfor education.<br />\nThat all seems like one hell of a<br />\ngood reason for demonstrating - far more so perhaps than Princeton's complaints about visiting<br />\nhours, or even Columbia's about<br />\nstudent administration. Well, there<br />\nwere demonstrations.<br />\nThe slogans were simple: more<br />\nfinancial support for higher education, fiscal autonomy for the<br />\nState colleges. At Glassboro, a<br />\ncoffin declaring the death of higher education in New Jersey was<br />\nparaded around campus. Then the<br />\nprotest went State-wide. Student<br />\nleaders from other campuses joined with GSC student government<br />\npresident (not SDS president)<br />\nRobert Loughran to organize a<br />\nprotest march on Trenton. 2500<br />\nstudents were there. Thirty percent of Glassboro's 2700 students<br />\nwere there. Thirty per cent.<br />\n\"The Governor (Hughes) and<br />\nthe chancellor (Duncan, of the<br />\ndiplomat turned educator school)<br />\ncame out on the Capital steps to<br />\ntalk to us,\" said Loughran. \"The<br />\nGovernor blamed the situation on<br />\nthe Republicans. The chancellor<br />\nsaid nothing at all. He thanked<br />\nus for our interest and said how<br />\nnice it was that we were orderly.<br />\nThat really turned us off.\"<br />\n<br />\ndid, we'd expell them overnight.<br />\nBut if it happened once, if it<br />\nwas big, but peaceful - - it would<br />\nnot happen that way again. Read<br />\nthe newspapers. At Cheyney, 300<br />\nstudent barricaded themselves inside a building as a protest; they<br />\ngot loads of attention. At Stanford,<br />\none-one hundredth of the student<br />\nbody occupied an office building;<br />\nthey got plenty of attention. The<br />\nGlassboro students finally got the<br />\npicture. If you don't raise hell,<br />\nyou don't get anything.<br />\n\"We will meet again Friday, to<br />\nplan our next course of action,\"<br />\nsaid a disgusted Loughran after<br />\nseeinr(or rather failing to see)<br />\nresults of the protest. \"I hate to<br />\neven use the word 'militant' but<br />\ntoday - - where else can you<br />\ngo?\"<br />\nThe State Board of Higher<br />\nEducation urged this week that<br />\nthe State Legislature approve<br />\n$493-million for higher education.<br />\nIf the New Jersey demonstration<br />\nis indeed a success, if the money<br />\n(so oft' promised, but ne'er as yet<br />\nreceived) is forthcoming, the protest will have been a quiet victory.<br />\nIf it is not, Glassboro State may<br />\nonce again gain some kind of<br />\nnational attention as the place<br />\nwhere peaceful demonstrations<br />\nfail.<br />\nIn either case, there is.a lesson<br />\nto be learned here by all parties<br />\nconcerned with the problems of<br />\nhigher education be they student<br />\nor administrator. Is militancy the<br />\nonly way; is it the most successful<br />\nway? Does a 'militant' movement<br />\ninvolving one hundredth of the<br />\nstudent body deserve more attention than a 'peaceful' movement of<br />\n3070? Is it the havoc raised or the<br />\nissues raised that are more import-ant?

Baltimore news is<br />\nthe blind acceptance of the official line, the Time magazine emphasis on good as contrasted to<br />\nbad facts and television, my God.<br />\nTelevision journalism in Baltimore<br />\nis a tribute to the hapless<br />\namateur's ability to snatch defeat<br />\nfrom the jaws of technology. It is<br />\nthe WJZ token Negro doing black<br />\npower specials, it is newsreels of<br />\nthe sports staff kissing their wives<br />\ngood-bye to board the plane for<br />\nFlorida spring training, it is the<br />\nAtlantic weatherman picking his<br />\n<br />\nnone on camera (again)<br />\nBe not too hard, there's always<br />\nthe News-Letter, whose truth,<br />\nthough often deleted by a customarily restricted university, will<br />\noccasionally slip through to earn<br />\nthe compliment of self-righteously<br />\nindignant rebuttal. But the NewsLetter is no longer alone. As of<br />\nthis moment Baltimore is graced<br />\nwith three other little, expressive<br />\npublications, born of emotion,<br />\ntempered with understanding and<br />\nopen to the light of day whin is<br />\nseen so rarely the big pages of the<br />\nregulars.<br />\nThe first of these papers to<br />\nappear, the Baltimore Peace and<br />\nFreedom News is without a doubt<br />\nthe best of the three. It has<br />\nsurvived some evolutionary cramps<br />\nto become a publication radical<br />\nenough to sell for money and good<br />\nenough to deserve it. It's news is<br />\n<br />\ncurrent as opposed to Passing<br />\n(called \"Contemporary\" but merely doomed to become Dated).<br />\nP And F is more than the Baltimore radical's window on the<br />\nworld. It is a creative attempt to<br />\nincorporate the interests and opinions of the disenchanted into a<br />\nunified and intertwining program.<br />\nThe expression of opinion in<br />\nP and F is an expression to this<br />\nend more than it is an expression<br />\nof any particular dogma and as<br />\nsuch P and F makes a real contribution to the Baltimore thinking<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe second \"underground\"<br />\npublication, the Baltimore Free<br />\nPress, is Here At Last. A publication, second in appearance and<br />\nquality, catering to a more narrow<br />\naudience. The thing about the<br />\nFree Press, is that it's been done,<br />\nalmost down to the last paragraph,<br />\n<br />\nad, psychedelic (sic) pschedelicness. That in itself is not a condemnation. Even if it has been<br />\ndone, it has been done well and<br />\ncan be so done again. The Free<br />\nPress, in its first issue set its<br />\npolicy, stated its attempt.

His arguments,<br />\nhowever, are invalid and the position he holds incorrect. Gordon's<br />\narguments are unconvincing for<br />\nnowhere in them does he consider<br />\nutilitarian considerations<br />\nthe<br />\nwhich are truly relevant in deciding which facility should be built<br />\nfirst. He fails to even discuss the<br />\nquestion of whether or not the<br />\ntotal benefit accruing to the Hopkins student body and faculty<br />\nfrom the construction of the student building would be greater<br />\nthan the total benefit that Baltimore would derive as a result of<br />\nfreeing building space so that Hopkins social scientists could carry on<br />\nactivities relevant to solving municipal social problems (Gordon's<br />\nprimary argument for insisting that<br />\nthe construction of an administration building should take precedence.)<br />\nWith all due respect to the social science disciplines, it seems to<br />\nme that, in weighing up relative<br />\nutilities, the case for constructing<br />\na student union building is overwhelming. It is undoubtedly true,<br />\nas Professor Gordon points out,<br />\nthat social scientists have much to<br />\ncontribute toward the improvement of our wider social setting.<br />\nBut it scarcely seems to be the<br />\ncase that their research has the<br />\nmomentous import which he suggests when he puts before us the<br />\nspectre of a burning Baltimore on<br />\npain of failing to grant the social<br />\nscientists an increment in their<br />\nfacilities.<br />\nContrary to Professor Gordon,<br />\nunion building would be<br />\nstudent<br />\na<br />\nmore than merely a place to play<br />\nping pong. Such a facility is vitally<br />\nnecessary for breaking down the<br />\nsense of isolation and resulting<br />\napathy which plagues the Hopkins<br />\nstudent body. Having an adequate<br />\nsized, attractive student center<br />\nwould remove the major gross impediment which stands in the way<br />\nof creating a university community<br />\nas opposed to the cold institutional environment which characterizes<br />\nour campus.<br />\nIn addition to his argument in<br />\nterms of relative utilities Professor<br />\nGordon appeals to the students'<br />\nsense of values by asking \"whether<br />\nthe undergraduates (would) really<br />\nprefer to hold degress from a cam-<br />\n<br />\npus with a student union building<br />\nrather than a university that is<br />\nknown for its intellectual quality.\"<br />\nLeaving aside the either-or formulation of this query, it strikes me<br />\nthat in posing it perhaps Professor<br />\nGordon is placing an unjustifiably<br />\nimportance on the question 'What<br />\nkitid of place do you want to be<br />\nfrom?'and not enough importance<br />\non the question 'What kind of<br />\nplace do you want to be at?'.<br />\nRobert F. Ladenson<br />\nWITHOUT PHAL<br />\nTo the Editors: \u2022<br />\nMonday. evening, May 13, I objected to the Student Council that<br />\nthe Honor Commission selections<br />\nto be approved by the council<br />\nwere unconstitutional.<br />\n(1) The Honor Commission<br />\nconstitution states that<br />\n\"there shall be an interviewing committee composed of3 seniors: 2 from<br />\nthe Honor commission<br />\nand 1 from the Student<br />\nCouncil; appointed at the<br />\nbeginning of the school<br />\nyear.<br />\n(2) This appointed committee was Bruce Ledig, Rennie Potter, John Marl3w.<br />\n(3) On Thursday, May 9,<br />\nSeveral people were interviewed by John Marlow<br />\nand Mel Schuster.<br />\n(4) On Friday, May 10, Six<br />\npeople were interviewed<br />\nby Dave Buchdahl.<br />\nMr. Buchdahl admitted that the<br />\ninterviews were unconstitutional<br />\nbut it was irrelevant. If forced, the<br />\nHonor Commission would hold 5<br />\nminute interviews for those who<br />\nhad been interviewed unconstitutionally. Following their interviews<br />\nthe same list would be resubmitted to the Council for approval (it<br />\nwas pointed out by someone else<br />\nthat this would force the Student<br />\nCouncil to meet again). The Student Council Subsequently denied<br />\nmy objection 7-6.<br />\nWhy was my objection denied?<br />\nNot because the interviews were<br />\nconstitutional; they plainly were<br />\nhot, and it was stated they were<br />\nnot by the chairman of the Honor<br />\nCommission. It must have been<br />\ndenied because the whole thing<br />\nwould not make any practical difference anyway and why should<br />\nthey have to meet again.<br />\nIf the Honor Commission cannot abide by the rules it has set up<br />\nfor itself, how are we expected to<br />\nabide by the rules they set up for<br />\nus.<br />\nBrady Black<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday afternoon, May<br />\n24th. the Johns Hopkins Hospital will hold its annual Turtle<br />\nDerby.

Taussig, pediatrician at the Hopkins Hospital, has<br />\npraised the Hospital because it has<br />\nnot, as yet, performed the muchpublicized heart transplants on humans.<br />\nDr. Taussig is responsible for<br />\ndeciding which operations on infants will be performed at the Hospital. She believes that heart transplants are still in the research stage<br />\nand that Hopkins' reluctance to<br />\nperform these operations at this<br />\ntime will set a good example for<br />\nother hospitals. J. H. H. feels that<br />\nthe new operation is overly hazardous at this point.<br />\nHopkins had previously followed a similar proeedure regarding<br />\nopen heart surgery. This policy<br />\nwas valuable in discouraging other<br />\nhospitals from performing these<br />\ndangerous operations until the<br />\ntechniques were fully developed.<br />\nCapable for Years<br />\nDr. J. Alexander Haller, pediatric surgeon at the Hospital stated<br />\nthat Hopkins has been capable of<br />\nperforming the technical aspects of<br />\nheart transplants for the last five<br />\nyears. It was delayed, however,<br />\ndue to the problems in controlling<br />\nthe rejection of the foreign heart.<br />\nThe drugs available today which<br />\nwill suppress rejection of the alien<br />\norgan, also block antibody formation in general, leaving the patient<br />\nacutely susceptible to bacterial infection. Dr. Haller sees a possible<br />\nanswer in a new substance called<br />\nantilymphocyte serum. This is an<br />\nantibody isolated from a horse injected with human lymphocytes.<br />\nThe scrum, injected into a human, would specificly attack the<br />\nlymphocytes which are responsible<br />\nfor rejecting transplanted hearts.<br />\nIt would leave the other types of<br />\nwhite blood cells free to combat<br />\ngeneral infection.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Haller indicated that the<br />\nfirst heart transplants at Hopkins<br />\nwould probably be performed on<br />\nchildren with congenital heart abnormalities or adults with diseased<br />\ncoronary arteries. These malfunctions can not be corrected in any<br />\nother way. Malfunctioning valves,<br />\non the other hand, can be efficiently replaced by artificial valves,<br />\nthus eliminating the need for heart<br />\ntransplants in this specific case.<br />\nDr. Haller added that before<br />\nheart transplants should be performed on humans, kidney transplants should be performed. In the<br />\nlatter case, if the operation fails<br />\nthe patient can be plugged into an<br />\n<br />\nartificial kidney and will not die.<br />\nIt seems that a general principle<br />\nin surgery is,\"do no harm.\" Many<br />\nsurgeons believe that if one performs a heart transplant on a patient and then gives him a drug<br />\nwhich allows him to die, one is irm<br />\nplicating oneself in the patient's<br />\ndeath.<br />\nThe general feeling at Hopkins<br />\nHospital is that the ultimate answer will probably be artificial<br />\nhearts(in lieu of hearts transplanted from other humans). This will<br />\neliminate the thorny problem of<br />\nstorage, and enable the surgeon to<br />\ntake an artificial heart off the shelf<br />\nwhenever needed.<br />\n.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council Seeking<br />\nIncreased Student Funds<br />\nto the Student Activities Account<br />\nmay well be inadequate to meet<br />\nthe needs of student organizations<br />\nand programs planned for the<br />\ncoming year.

The<br />\nfirst program will run from July<br />\n8th to August 15th and will involve one hour of tutoring and<br />\none hour of recreation from 10<br />\na.m. - 12 noon, Monday through<br />\nThursday.<br />\nChildren will come to the<br />\nHomewood campus and work with<br />\ntutors on a 1-1 basis.

The rest was a just a jumbleofuntruths,<br />\nhalf-truths, distortions, obliquities, and misrepresentations.<br />\nWe believe, in the name of fair-play, that it is<br />\nabout time such propaganda, fraud and gimmick,<br />\ndesigned primarily to pull the wool over the eyes<br />\nof the American people, be challenged and exposed<br />\nonce and for all. , Let it be noted at the outset that<br />\nrespectability to its acattempt to lend<br />\nin an<br />\nthe late Dr. John Leighton<br />\ninvoked<br />\ngroup<br />\ncusations, the<br />\nStuart, former U.S. Ambassador to China, as the first<br />\nwitness.

STUART REFER EVEN REMOTELY TO THE FEB. 28 INCIDENT, MUCH<br />\nLESS THE FIGURE OF 10,000 BEING MASSACRED.<br />\n<br />\nIn a further attempt to mislead the American<br />\npeople, the ad subpoenaed certain unnamed wit\"Other scholars' estimates,\" it said,<br />\nnesses.<br />\n\"range from 10,000 to 20,000.\" We have reason<br />\nto believe that the references include George Kerr,<br />\nauthor of the book \"Formosa Betrayed,\" who claiming he was in Taiwan at the time,estimated the number<br />\nkilled at between 10,000 and 20,000. To those who<br />\nhave not researched on the events related to the<br />\nFeb. 28 incident, Kerr appeared to be documenting<br />\nhis charges, but the identity of his sources seldom<br />\nwent beyond \"an anonymous informant,\" or \"one<br />\nprominent person,\" or \"our sources of information,\"<br />\nor \"A former student,\" or \"a Catholic nurse\" and<br />\nso on. His unreliability has more than once been<br />\nexposed. Taken at random, for example, in one of<br />\nthe rare cases in which he tried to be specific by<br />\nreported (page 298): \"Gan<br />\nnaming names, Kerr<br />\nKin-en, owner and director of important mining<br />\nInterests, was seized and killed \"in the March<br />\nmassacre\" following the Feb. 28 incident. Less<br />\nthan six weeks after his book was published the same<br />\nGan Kin-en, like Mark Twain, protested Kerr's premature report of his death. Writing from Taipei<br />\non March 14, 1966, Gan said by way of correction:<br />\n\"I was not seized by the Government forces in that<br />\nincident. I certainly was not killed, as I am still<br />\nvery much alive. As to my mining interests, they<br />\nhave been developing steadily in the past twenty<br />\nyears as result of the Government's policy of encouragement to private enterprise on the island.\"<br />\nWe share Mr. Gan's evaluation that \"if it was so<br />\nInaccurate about what happened to me, I believe<br />\nthere must be many distortions in Kerr's book.\"<br />\n<br />\nNOW, LET US LOOK AT THE FACTS.<br />\nTo put the story in its proper perspective, it<br />\nshould first of all be remembered what the Chinese National Government was confronted with on<br />\nthe mainland as well as on Taiwan at the time.<br />\nOn Jan. 29, 1947, Washington announced the abandonment of official American efforts to mediate<br />\nbetween Nanking and Yenan. The very next day,<br />\nthe Chinese Communists decided on a showdown with<br />\nNanking \"by force of arms.\" Immediately and<br />\nsimultaneously, they launched new offensives on<br />\nmany fronts, including a radio appeal to the inhabitants of Formosa to \"overthrow\" the government authorities in that province.<br />\nIt was amidst such a highly charged atmosphere<br />\nthat the<br />\nFebruary 28 Incident unfortunately occurr&l in Taipei. One of the important Government<br />\ntasks in fighting inflation in those days was to stop<br />\nthe smuggling and sale of non-taxed goods. In step<br />\nwith that policy, six inspectors of the Taiwan Monopoly<br />\nBureau.were on the alert for peddlers of smuggled<br />\ncigarettes on the evening of Feb. 27. One of the inspectors, Fu Hsueh-tung, was on the point of arresting a woman peddler when some of the sympathetic bystanders intervened on the woman's behalf.<br />\nFu beat a hasty retreat, but the mob gave<br />\nchase, and in a moment of confusion, Fu used his<br />\n<br />\npistol and killed one of the chasers, Chen Wen-chi.<br />\nFu was arrested, but the mob, now bigger, laid seige<br />\nto the police headquarters, demanding that Fu be<br />\nsurrendered to them for execution on the spot. The<br />\npolice quite rightly refused. This relatively minor<br />\nincident provided the fuse that set off the Feb. 28<br />\nIncident.<br />\nThe situation was quickly exploited by two elements<br />\nof the population: (1) Communist agents (headed by<br />\nHsieh Hsueh-hung and Chen Fu-chi) who had already<br />\ninfiltrated into all levels of society since Taiwan's<br />\nretrocession to<br />\nChina following Japan's defeat in<br />\nlate 1945, and (2) a small group of malcontents,<br />\nunder the leadership of Peh Cheng-tse, pro-Japanese<br />\nin sentiment or by training in the Japanese army,<br />\nclamoring for Taiwan independence.<br />\nTo make a long story short, it may safely be<br />\nstated here that the Feb. 28 incident -- not dissimilar to what frequently occurs in any big American city, someone's being shot by a policeman or vice<br />\nversa -- would have been settled without difficulty<br />\n(the Government decided on 200,000 Taiwan dollars<br />\ncompensation to the family of the person killed),<br />\nwere it not for the Communists' fanning the flames<br />\nbehind the scene.<br />\nThe result was: what started as a genuine, spontaneous protest demonstration later turned into riots.<br />\nWithin a few days, localized Taipei riots spread to<br />\nother cities, with Communist front organizations<br />\ninciting students to form fighting units. Raids were<br />\nmade on military stores. For ten days, violence<br />\nraged uncontrolled.<br />\nUp to Feb. 28, the Government had only one battalion of military police to maintain peace and order.<br />\nIt was only after March 7, when armed rioters began<br />\nattacking government offices and police stations, that<br />\nthe Central Government at Nanking decided to send<br />\nmilitary reinforcements to Taiwan, which landed on<br />\nMarch 10 and succeeded in restoring order.<br />\n<br />\nIn all, according to unimpeachable sources, casualties figures on both sides totalled 1,951 of which 190 persons were killed<br />\nand 1,761 wounded. A further breakdown<br />\nshowed that among the killed, 43 were local<br />\nrioters, 57 former residents on the mainland<br />\nand 90 military personnel (16 officers and<br />\n74 other ranks).<br />\nThis, in our opinion, is certainly a far cry<br />\nfrom what the \"United Formosans for Independence propagandizes JS \"The Formosa<br />\nMassacre.\"<br />\nFederation of Chinese Student and Alumni<br />\nAssociations in U.S.A., Inc.<br />\n185 Canal Street, Room 206<br />\nNew York, N.Y. 10013<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 10<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 17, 1968 IOM]<br />\n<br />\nYEAR OF THE BLUE JAY<br />\n<br />\nmuc<br />\nald,<br />\nhgaen<br />\n<br />\ncam,<br />\nyear<br />\nMar;<br />\nsdenzi<br />\n<br />\ncard<br />\naci<br />\nre<br />\nwas<br />\nresp<br />\nand<br />\nto .<br />\nimp<br />\n(.35<br />\nThe<br />\n'End<br />\nplac<br />\nsion<br />\n4. will<br />\nV<br />\nfull3<br />\nof o<br />\nmoc<br />\nar<br />\nnerwil<br />\n<br />\nFIRST STRING MIDDIE Charles Goddell battles for control<br />\nof ball in Army clash.

Columbia, right?<br />\nWrong. Then, perhaps, Cheyney?<br />\nOr Stanford? Or Princeton? No.<br />\nThe Sorbonne, then. Wrong, all<br />\nwrong. The school was Glassboro<br />\nState College of New Jersey. Ever<br />\nheard of it? Think now. Oh yes,<br />\nGSC, made world famous for that<br />\nlong since forgotten Summit<br />\nMeeting of last summer. So how<br />\ncome nobody heard of any rioting<br />\nin New Jersey, if it was such a big<br />\nimportant event?<br />\nThe reason is frightfully simple:<br />\nthere were no riots, no captured<br />\ndeans, no burnings, no militants.<br />\nIncredible - - that it worked, that<br />\nit even happened. The demonstration got very little press; a local<br />\nnewspaper neglected the story<br />\nentirely. A Philadelphia television<br />\nstation gave the story 30 seconds<br />\nof air time. Yet, it is a story that<br />\nshould be heard by this campus,<br />\nits students, faculty, administrators and trustees: the story of the<br />\nmost significant non-violent student demonstration, and because<br />\nof its lack of recognition, perhaps<br />\nthe last.<br />\nThe cause of the disturbance<br />\nwas a long history of total neglect<br />\non the part of a series of state<br />\ngoverments of the educational<br />\nfacilities of New Jersey. There are<br />\nsix State colleges and all are, to<br />\nquote one columnist, \"a mess.\"<br />\nAlthough the State is seventh in<br />\nper capita income, she is 50th in<br />\nper capita expediture for higher<br />\neducation, and until Puerto Rico<br />\nbecomes a State, there she will<br />\nstay.<br />\nThe State has become so lax<br />\nin the area of higher education<br />\nthat she has taken to depending<br />\nupon other States to build facilities, an attitude that so enraged the<br />\nUniversity of Michigan that it set<br />\nup a quota for New. Jersey<br />\nresidents.<br />\nThe schools Jersey does have<br />\nare not even satisfactorally taken<br /><br />\ncare of. Glassboro, for example,<br />\ndoes not have enough dormitory<br />\nspace or Classroom facilities. The<br />\nlibrary just got a new second floor,<br />\nbut no books have been purchased<br />\nto fill it. The tuition paid by New<br />\nJersey students does not even go<br />\nto the college, but rather it goes<br />\ninto the State's general fund with<br />\nno guarantee that it will be used<br />\nfor education.<br />\nThat all seems like one hell of a<br />\ngood reason for demonstrating - far more so perhaps than Princeton's complaints about visiting<br />\nhours, or even Columbia's about<br />\nstudent administration. Well, there<br />\nwere demonstrations.<br />\nThe slogans were simple: more<br />\nfinancial support for higher education, fiscal autonomy for the<br />\nState colleges. At Glassboro, a<br />\ncoffin declaring the death of higher education in New Jersey was<br />\nparaded around campus. Then the<br />\nprotest went State-wide. Student<br />\nleaders from other campuses joined with GSC student government<br />\npresident (not SDS president)<br />\nRobert Loughran to organize a<br />\nprotest march on Trenton. 2500<br />\nstudents were there. Thirty percent of Glassboro's 2700 students<br />\nwere there. Thirty per cent.<br />\n\"The Governor (Hughes) and<br />\nthe chancellor (Duncan, of the<br />\ndiplomat turned educator school)<br />\ncame out on the Capital steps to<br />\ntalk to us,\" said Loughran. \"The<br />\nGovernor blamed the situation on<br />\nthe Republicans. The chancellor<br />\nsaid nothing at all. He thanked<br />\nus for our interest and said how<br />\nnice it was that we were orderly.<br />\nThat really turned us off.\"<br /><br />\ndid, we'd expell them overnight.<br />\nBut if it happened once, if it<br />\nwas big, but peaceful - - it would<br />\nnot happen that way again. Read<br />\nthe newspapers. At Cheyney, 300<br />\nstudent barricaded themselves inside a building as a protest; they<br />\ngot loads of attention. At Stanford,<br />\none-one hundredth of the student<br />\nbody occupied an office building;<br />\nthey got plenty of attention. The<br />\nGlassboro students finally got the<br />\npicture. If you don't raise hell,<br />\nyou don't get anything.<br />\n\"We will meet again Friday, to<br />\nplan our next course of action,\"<br />\nsaid a disgusted Loughran after<br />\nseeinr(or rather failing to see)<br />\nresults of the protest. \"I hate to<br />\neven use the word 'militant' but<br />\ntoday - - where else can you<br />\ngo?\"<br />\nThe State Board of Higher<br />\nEducation urged this week that<br />\nthe State Legislature approve<br />\n$493-million for higher education.<br />\nIf the New Jersey demonstration<br />\nis indeed a success, if the money<br />\n(so oft' promised, but ne'er as yet<br />\nreceived) is forthcoming, the protest will have been a quiet victory.<br />\nIf it is not, Glassboro State may<br />\nonce again gain some kind of<br />\nnational attention as the place<br />\nwhere peaceful demonstrations<br />\nfail.<br />\nIn either case, there is.a lesson<br />\nto be learned here by all parties<br />\nconcerned with the problems of<br />\nhigher education be they student<br />\nor administrator. Is militancy the<br />\nonly way; is it the most successful<br />\nway? Does a 'militant' movement<br />\ninvolving one hundredth of the<br />\nstudent body deserve more attention than a 'peaceful' movement of<br />\n3070? Is it the havoc raised or the<br />\nissues raised that are more import-ant? When students do present<br />\ntheir grievancies in an orderly fashion are they to be listened to or<br />\nplacated and ignored until violence<br />\ndoes break out?<br /><br />\nIt was nice of the chancellor to<br />\nsay that the demonstrators were<br />\nnice. He promised no action; he<br />\ndidn't seem too worried about the<br />\nwhole thing. It was just so nice<br />\nand peaceful and, hell, why do<br />\nanything until they start throwing<br />\nstones and taking over buildings<br />\nand these bastards aren't about to<br />\ndo that because they're all nice<br />\nThe dollars and cents returns<br />\nkids from nice respectable New from New Jersey may hold the<br />\nJersey homes and because if they answers.

At the extreme end to the north lies the<br />\nomnipresent squire to any metropolis- - suburbia.

Baltimore news is<br />\nthe blind acceptance of the official line, the Time magazine emphasis on good as contrasted to<br />\nbad facts and television, my God.<br />\nTelevision journalism in Baltimore<br />\nis a tribute to the hapless<br />\namateur's ability to snatch defeat<br />\nfrom the jaws of technology. It is<br />\nthe WJZ token Negro doing black<br />\npower specials, it is newsreels of<br />\nthe sports staff kissing their wives<br />\ngood-bye to board the plane for<br />\nFlorida spring training, it is the<br />\nAtlantic weatherman picking his<br /><br />\nnone on camera (again)<br />\nBe not too hard, there's always<br />\nthe News-Letter, whose truth,<br />\nthough often deleted by a customarily restricted university, will<br />\noccasionally slip through to earn<br />\nthe compliment of self-righteously<br />\nindignant rebuttal. But the NewsLetter is no longer alone. As of<br />\nthis moment Baltimore is graced<br />\nwith three other little, expressive<br />\npublications, born of emotion,<br />\ntempered with understanding and<br />\nopen to the light of day whin is<br />\nseen so rarely the big pages of the<br />\nregulars.<br />\nThe first of these papers to<br />\nappear, the Baltimore Peace and<br />\nFreedom News is without a doubt<br />\nthe best of the three. It has<br />\nsurvived some evolutionary cramps<br />\nto become a publication radical<br />\nenough to sell for money and good<br />\nenough to deserve it. It's news is<br /><br />\ncurrent as opposed to Passing<br />\n(called \"Contemporary\" but merely doomed to become Dated).<br />\nP And F is more than the Baltimore radical's window on the<br />\nworld. It is a creative attempt to<br />\nincorporate the interests and opinions of the disenchanted into a<br />\nunified and intertwining program.<br />\nThe expression of opinion in<br />\nP and F is an expression to this<br />\nend more than it is an expression<br />\nof any particular dogma and as<br />\nsuch P and F makes a real contribution to the Baltimore thinking<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nThe second \"underground\"<br />\npublication, the Baltimore Free<br />\nPress, is Here At Last. A publication, second in appearance and<br />\nquality, catering to a more narrow<br />\naudience. The thing about the<br />\nFree Press, is that it's been done,<br />\nalmost down to the last paragraph,<br /><br />\nad, psychedelic (sic) pschedelicness. That in itself is not a condemnation. Even if it has been<br />\ndone, it has been done well and<br />\ncan be so done again. The Free<br />\nPress, in its first issue set its<br />\npolicy, stated its attempt.

His arguments,<br />\nhowever, are invalid and the position he holds incorrect. Gordon's<br />\narguments are unconvincing for<br />\nnowhere in them does he consider<br />\nutilitarian considerations<br />\nthe<br />\nwhich are truly relevant in deciding which facility should be built<br />\nfirst. He fails to even discuss the<br />\nquestion of whether or not the<br />\ntotal benefit accruing to the Hopkins student body and faculty<br />\nfrom the construction of the student building would be greater<br />\nthan the total benefit that Baltimore would derive as a result of<br />\nfreeing building space so that Hopkins social scientists could carry on<br />\nactivities relevant to solving municipal social problems (Gordon's<br />\nprimary argument for insisting that<br />\nthe construction of an administration building should take precedence.)<br />\nWith all due respect to the social science disciplines, it seems to<br />\nme that, in weighing up relative<br />\nutilities, the case for constructing<br />\na student union building is overwhelming. It is undoubtedly true,<br />\nas Professor Gordon points out,<br />\nthat social scientists have much to<br />\ncontribute toward the improvement of our wider social setting.<br />\nBut it scarcely seems to be the<br />\ncase that their research has the<br />\nmomentous import which he suggests when he puts before us the<br />\nspectre of a burning Baltimore on<br />\npain of failing to grant the social<br />\nscientists an increment in their<br />\nfacilities.<br />\nContrary to Professor Gordon,<br />\nunion building would be<br />\nstudent<br />\na<br />\nmore than merely a place to play<br />\nping pong. Such a facility is vitally<br />\nnecessary for breaking down the<br />\nsense of isolation and resulting<br />\napathy which plagues the Hopkins<br />\nstudent body. Having an adequate<br />\nsized, attractive student center<br />\nwould remove the major gross impediment which stands in the way<br />\nof creating a university community<br />\nas opposed to the cold institutional environment which characterizes<br />\nour campus.<br />\nIn addition to his argument in<br />\nterms of relative utilities Professor<br />\nGordon appeals to the students'<br />\nsense of values by asking \"whether<br />\nthe undergraduates (would) really<br />\nprefer to hold degress from a cam-<br /><br />\npus with a student union building<br />\nrather than a university that is<br />\nknown for its intellectual quality.\"<br />\nLeaving aside the either-or formulation of this query, it strikes me<br />\nthat in posing it perhaps Professor<br />\nGordon is placing an unjustifiably<br />\nimportance on the question 'What<br />\nkitid of place do you want to be<br />\nfrom?'and not enough importance<br />\non the question 'What kind of<br />\nplace do you want to be at?'.<br />\nRobert F. Ladenson<br />\nWITHOUT PHAL<br />\nTo the Editors: \u2022<br />\nMonday. evening, May 13, I objected to the Student Council that<br />\nthe Honor Commission selections<br />\nto be approved by the council<br />\nwere unconstitutional.<br />\n(1) The Honor Commission<br />\nconstitution states that<br />\n\"there shall be an interviewing committee composed of3 seniors: 2 from<br />\nthe Honor commission<br />\nand 1 from the Student<br />\nCouncil; appointed at the<br />\nbeginning of the school<br />\nyear.<br />\n(2) This appointed committee was Bruce Ledig, Rennie Potter, John Marl3w.<br />\n(3) On Thursday, May 9,<br />\nSeveral people were interviewed by John Marlow<br />\nand Mel Schuster.<br />\n(4) On Friday, May 10, Six<br />\npeople were interviewed<br />\nby Dave Buchdahl.<br />\nMr. Buchdahl admitted that the<br />\ninterviews were unconstitutional<br />\nbut it was irrelevant. If forced, the<br />\nHonor Commission would hold 5<br />\nminute interviews for those who<br />\nhad been interviewed unconstitutionally. Following their interviews<br />\nthe same list would be resubmitted to the Council for approval (it<br />\nwas pointed out by someone else<br />\nthat this would force the Student<br />\nCouncil to meet again). The Student Council Subsequently denied<br />\nmy objection 7-6.<br />\nWhy was my objection denied?<br />\nNot because the interviews were<br />\nconstitutional; they plainly were<br />\nhot, and it was stated they were<br />\nnot by the chairman of the Honor<br />\nCommission. It must have been<br />\ndenied because the whole thing<br />\nwould not make any practical difference anyway and why should<br />\nthey have to meet again.<br />\nIf the Honor Commission cannot abide by the rules it has set up<br />\nfor itself, how are we expected to<br />\nabide by the rules they set up for<br />\nus.<br />\nBrady Black<br /><br />\nOn Friday afternoon, May<br />\n24th. the Johns Hopkins Hospital will hold its annual Turtle<br />\nDerby.

Taussig, pediatrician at the Hopkins Hospital, has<br />\npraised the Hospital because it has<br />\nnot, as yet, performed the muchpublicized heart transplants on humans.<br />\nDr. Taussig is responsible for<br />\ndeciding which operations on infants will be performed at the Hospital. She believes that heart transplants are still in the research stage<br />\nand that Hopkins' reluctance to<br />\nperform these operations at this<br />\ntime will set a good example for<br />\nother hospitals. J. H. H. feels that<br />\nthe new operation is overly hazardous at this point.<br />\nHopkins had previously followed a similar proeedure regarding<br />\nopen heart surgery. This policy<br />\nwas valuable in discouraging other<br />\nhospitals from performing these<br />\ndangerous operations until the<br />\ntechniques were fully developed.<br />\nCapable for Years<br />\nDr. J. Alexander Haller, pediatric surgeon at the Hospital stated<br />\nthat Hopkins has been capable of<br />\nperforming the technical aspects of<br />\nheart transplants for the last five<br />\nyears. It was delayed, however,<br />\ndue to the problems in controlling<br />\nthe rejection of the foreign heart.<br />\nThe drugs available today which<br />\nwill suppress rejection of the alien<br />\norgan, also block antibody formation in general, leaving the patient<br />\nacutely susceptible to bacterial infection. Dr. Haller sees a possible<br />\nanswer in a new substance called<br />\nantilymphocyte serum. This is an<br />\nantibody isolated from a horse injected with human lymphocytes.<br />\nThe scrum, injected into a human, would specificly attack the<br />\nlymphocytes which are responsible<br />\nfor rejecting transplanted hearts.<br />\nIt would leave the other types of<br />\nwhite blood cells free to combat<br />\ngeneral infection.<br /><br />\nDr. Haller indicated that the<br />\nfirst heart transplants at Hopkins<br />\nwould probably be performed on<br />\nchildren with congenital heart abnormalities or adults with diseased<br />\ncoronary arteries. These malfunctions can not be corrected in any<br />\nother way. Malfunctioning valves,<br />\non the other hand, can be efficiently replaced by artificial valves,<br />\nthus eliminating the need for heart<br />\ntransplants in this specific case.<br />\nDr. Haller added that before<br />\nheart transplants should be performed on humans, kidney transplants should be performed. In the<br />\nlatter case, if the operation fails<br />\nthe patient can be plugged into an<br /><br />\nartificial kidney and will not die.<br />\nIt seems that a general principle<br />\nin surgery is,\"do no harm.\" Many<br />\nsurgeons believe that if one performs a heart transplant on a patient and then gives him a drug<br />\nwhich allows him to die, one is irm<br />\nplicating oneself in the patient's<br />\ndeath.<br />\nThe general feeling at Hopkins<br />\nHospital is that the ultimate answer will probably be artificial<br />\nhearts(in lieu of hearts transplanted from other humans). This will<br />\neliminate the thorny problem of<br />\nstorage, and enable the surgeon to<br />\ntake an artificial heart off the shelf<br />\nwhenever needed.<br />\n.\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nStudent Council Seeking<br />\nIncreased Student Funds<br />\nto the Student Activities Account<br />\nmay well be inadequate to meet<br />\nthe needs of student organizations<br />\nand programs planned for the<br />\ncoming year.

The<br />\nfirst program will run from July<br />\n8th to August 15th and will involve one hour of tutoring and<br />\none hour of recreation from 10<br />\na.m. - 12 noon, Monday through<br />\nThursday.<br />\nChildren will come to the<br />\nHomewood campus and work with<br />\ntutors on a 1-1 basis.

The rest was a just a jumbleofuntruths,<br />\nhalf-truths, distortions, obliquities, and misrepresentations.<br />\nWe believe, in the name of fair-play, that it is<br />\nabout time such propaganda, fraud and gimmick,<br />\ndesigned primarily to pull the wool over the eyes<br />\nof the American people, be challenged and exposed<br />\nonce and for all. , Let it be noted at the outset that<br />\nrespectability to its acattempt to lend<br />\nin an<br />\nthe late Dr. John Leighton<br />\ninvoked<br />\ngroup<br />\ncusations, the<br />\nStuart, former U.S. Ambassador to China, as the first<br />\nwitness. Dr. Stuart, the ad said, recorded in his<br />\nmemoir's:\"Fifty Years in China\" that \"10,000<br />\ninnocent civilians were shot down in cold blood.\"<br /><br />\nWITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION,<br />\nWE CHALLENGE THE \"'UNITED FORMOSANS FOR INDEPENDENCE\" TO CITE<br />\nCHAPTER,PAGE AND VERSE IN DR. STUART'S BOOK FOR THE STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO HIM. WE HAVE ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE<br />\nTO DO SO, SIMPLY BECAUSE NOWHERE<br />\nDID DR. STUART REFER EVEN REMOTELY TO THE FEB. 28 INCIDENT, MUCH<br />\nLESS THE FIGURE OF 10,000 BEING MASSACRED.<br /><br />\nIn a further attempt to mislead the American<br />\npeople, the ad subpoenaed certain unnamed wit\"Other scholars' estimates,\" it said,<br />\nnesses.<br />\n\"range from 10,000 to 20,000.\" We have reason<br />\nto believe that the references include George Kerr,<br />\nauthor of the book \"Formosa Betrayed,\" who claiming he was in Taiwan at the time,estimated the number<br />\nkilled at between 10,000 and 20,000. To those who<br />\nhave not researched on the events related to the<br />\nFeb. 28 incident, Kerr appeared to be documenting<br />\nhis charges, but the identity of his sources seldom<br />\nwent beyond \"an anonymous informant,\" or \"one<br />\nprominent person,\" or \"our sources of information,\"<br />\nor \"A former student,\" or \"a Catholic nurse\" and<br />\nso on. His unreliability has more than once been<br />\nexposed. Taken at random, for example, in one of<br />\nthe rare cases in which he tried to be specific by<br />\nreported (page 298): \"Gan<br />\nnaming names, Kerr<br />\nKin-en, owner and director of important mining<br />\nInterests, was seized and killed \"in the March<br />\nmassacre\" following the Feb. 28 incident. Less<br />\nthan six weeks after his book was published the same<br />\nGan Kin-en, like Mark Twain, protested Kerr's premature report of his death. Writing from Taipei<br />\non March 14, 1966, Gan said by way of correction:<br />\n\"I was not seized by the Government forces in that<br />\nincident. I certainly was not killed, as I am still<br />\nvery much alive. As to my mining interests, they<br />\nhave been developing steadily in the past twenty<br />\nyears as result of the Government's policy of encouragement to private enterprise on the island.\"<br />\nWe share Mr. Gan's evaluation that \"if it was so<br />\nInaccurate about what happened to me, I believe<br />\nthere must be many distortions in Kerr's book.\"<br /><br />\nNOW, LET US LOOK AT THE FACTS.<br />\nTo put the story in its proper perspective, it<br />\nshould first of all be remembered what the Chinese National Government was confronted with on<br />\nthe mainland as well as on Taiwan at the time.<br />\nOn Jan. 29, 1947, Washington announced the abandonment of official American efforts to mediate<br />\nbetween Nanking and Yenan. The very next day,<br />\nthe Chinese Communists decided on a showdown with<br />\nNanking \"by force of arms.\" Immediately and<br />\nsimultaneously, they launched new offensives on<br />\nmany fronts, including a radio appeal to the inhabitants of Formosa to \"overthrow\" the government authorities in that province.<br />\nIt was amidst such a highly charged atmosphere<br />\nthat the<br />\nFebruary 28 Incident unfortunately occurr&amp;l in Taipei. One of the important Government<br />\ntasks in fighting inflation in those days was to stop<br />\nthe smuggling and sale of non-taxed goods. In step<br />\nwith that policy, six inspectors of the Taiwan Monopoly<br />\nBureau.were on the alert for peddlers of smuggled<br />\ncigarettes on the evening of Feb. 27. One of the inspectors, Fu Hsueh-tung, was on the point of arresting a woman peddler when some of the sympathetic bystanders intervened on the woman's behalf.<br />\nFu beat a hasty retreat, but the mob gave<br />\nchase, and in a moment of confusion, Fu used his<br /><br />\npistol and killed one of the chasers, Chen Wen-chi.<br />\nFu was arrested, but the mob, now bigger, laid seige<br />\nto the police headquarters, demanding that Fu be<br />\nsurrendered to them for execution on the spot. The<br />\npolice quite rightly refused. This relatively minor<br />\nincident provided the fuse that set off the Feb. 28<br />\nIncident.<br />\nThe situation was quickly exploited by two elements<br />\nof the population: (1) Communist agents (headed by<br />\nHsieh Hsueh-hung and Chen Fu-chi) who had already<br />\ninfiltrated into all levels of society since Taiwan's<br />\nretrocession to<br />\nChina following Japan's defeat in<br />\nlate 1945, and (2) a small group of malcontents,<br />\nunder the leadership of Peh Cheng-tse, pro-Japanese<br />\nin sentiment or by training in the Japanese army,<br />\nclamoring for Taiwan independence.<br />\nTo make a long story short, it may safely be<br />\nstated here that the Feb. 28 incident -- not dissimilar to what frequently occurs in any big American city, someone's being shot by a policeman or vice<br />\nversa -- would have been settled without difficulty<br />\n(the Government decided on 200,000 Taiwan dollars<br />\ncompensation to the family of the person killed),<br />\nwere it not for the Communists' fanning the flames<br />\nbehind the scene.<br />\nThe result was: what started as a genuine, spontaneous protest demonstration later turned into riots.<br />\nWithin a few days, localized Taipei riots spread to<br />\nother cities, with Communist front organizations<br />\ninciting students to form fighting units. Raids were<br />\nmade on military stores. For ten days, violence<br />\nraged uncontrolled.<br />\nUp to Feb. 28, the Government had only one battalion of military police to maintain peace and order.<br />\nIt was only after March 7, when armed rioters began<br />\nattacking government offices and police stations, that<br />\nthe Central Government at Nanking decided to send<br />\nmilitary reinforcements to Taiwan, which landed on<br />\nMarch 10 and succeeded in restoring order.<br /><br />\nIn all, according to unimpeachable sources, casualties figures on both sides totalled 1,951 of which 190 persons were killed<br />\nand 1,761 wounded. A further breakdown<br />\nshowed that among the killed, 43 were local<br />\nrioters, 57 former residents on the mainland<br />\nand 90 military personnel (16 officers and<br />\n74 other ranks).<br />\nThis, in our opinion, is certainly a far cry<br />\nfrom what the \"United Formosans for Independence propagandizes JS \"The Formosa<br />\nMassacre.\"<br />\nFederation of Chinese Student and Alumni<br />\nAssociations in U.S.A., Inc.<br />\n185 Canal Street, Room 206<br />\nNew York, N.Y. 10013<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE 10<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, MAY 17, 1968 IOM]<br /><br />\nYEAR OF THE BLUE JAY<br /><br />\nmuc<br />\nald,<br />\nhgaen<br /><br />\ncam,<br />\nyear<br />\nMar;<br />\nsdenzi<br /><br />\ncard<br />\naci<br />\nre<br />\nwas<br />\nresp<br />\nand<br />\nto .<br />\nimp<br />\n(.35<br />\nThe<br />\n'End<br />\nplac<br />\nsion<br />\n4. will<br />\nV<br />\nfull3<br />\nof o<br />\nmoc<br />\nar<br />\nnerwil<br /><br />\nFIRST STRING MIDDIE Charles Goddell battles for control<br />\nof ball in Army clash.
