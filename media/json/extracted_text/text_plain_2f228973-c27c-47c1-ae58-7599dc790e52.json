Park-users<br />\nargue that Wyman Park is one<br />\nof the last pieces of land in the<br />\narea that has not been disrupted<br />\nby urbanization. Since the land<br />\nhas not been properly maintained or landscaped by the city, it<br />\nis, in large part, an untamed<br />\nwood with several unusual<br />\nspecies of flora and fauna.<br />\nResidents objected to the fact<br />\nthat no preliminary environmental impact study is<br />\nknown to have been done.<br />\nSeveral park-users have claimed to have seen mallards,<br />\nhawks, orioles, and even a fox<br />\nin the park. Concern over<br />\ndisplacing these animals by any<br />\nattempt at land improvement is<br />\nwidespread.<br />\nCouncilman Anthony J.<br />\nAmbridge, who represents<br />\nWyman Park citizens, expressed dissatisfaction with the plans<br />\nin the July 19 Sun. \"Open<br />\nspace is unique and it's not<br />\nrenewable. I just don't want to<br />\nsee it developed. It's just a<br />\nbeautiful, beautiful park.\"<br />\nA second major worry is the<br />\npossibility of disturbing the<br />\nstream which runs behind the<br />\nBIA field. Since the area is a<br />\nfloodplain, neighbors are concerned about changes in the<br />\nwater level resulting from<br />\nfuture development, and want<br />\nto know who will be responsible for any damage as a result<br />\nof future floods.<br />\nFears were also expressed<br />\nthat the University would use<br />\nthe land for secret, potentially<br />\nhazardous, or military research.<br />\nBowie answered this worry with<br />\na resounding \"No.\" \"The<br />\nuniversity has an absolute<br />\npolicy against any classified<br />\nresearch on this campus,\" he<br />\nmaintained.<br />\nResidents also pointed out<br />\nthat the proposed facilities<br />\nwould increase traffic in an<br />\nalready congested area. The City is now forming a task force<br />\nto examine these grievances and<br />\nto look for a just settlement.<br />\nHopkins considered obtaining Wyman Park after Mayor<br />\nSchaefer, during a budget hearing earlier this year, informally proposed the idea of making<br />\nthe land available to the<br />\nUniversity to expand the Space<br />\nTelescope Science Institute.<br />\nViewing the mayor's remarks as<br />\n<br />\na promise of support, Hopkins<br />\nofficials proceeded and had architects build a scale model of<br />\nthe proposed research facilities.<br />\nThis model was available for inspection by area residents last<br />\nAugust.<br />\nIn the July 19 Sun, Dagmar<br />\nMiller, president of the Wyman<br />\nPark Community Association,<br />\nexpressed the neighborhood's<br />\ndiscontent. \"I can't blame<br />\nHopkins for doing what it's doing, and I don't argue with the<br />\nvalue of Hopkins as a major<br />\nemployer and asset to the<br />\nneighborhood. What really<br />\nangers me is the mayor baiting<br />\nthem into asking for the rest of<br />\nthe park,\" she explained.<br />\nHopkins officials believe that<br />\nthe many benefits the development will bring outweigh the<br />\nnegative aspects. The current<br />\nproposal will provide more jobs<br />\nand the community will reap<br />\nthese economic advantages.<br />\nMuch of the land will remain<br />\nuntouched, according to<br />\nBowie, and Hopkins will take<br />\non the responsibility of maintaining it. \"We really don't<br />\nthink the rest of this [land] is<br />\nbuildable, but by owning it, we<br />\nthink we can upgrade it and<br />\nreally make it usable for<br />\neveryone,\" he added.<br />\nHopkins is presently considering only two building sites<br />\non the property and the chance<br />\nof future development is very<br />\nslim. \"I just don't think that<br />\n[further construction] is in the<br />\ncards,\" commented Bowie.<br />\n\"The topography just does not<br />\nlend itself to doing anything<br />\nreasonable.\" The steep slopes<br />\nin part of the park and the flow<br />\nof the stream limit building to<br />\na site on the extreme northern<br />\nend of Wyman Park and to the<br />\nsouth, near Olin Hall, according to Bowie.<br />\nAnother possibility, which<br />\nthe mayor is trying to prevent<br />\nis for Hopkins to build outside<br />\nof Baltimore City. Expansion is<br />\nnecessary and while the University would prefer to extend the<br />\nHomewood Campus, \"there is<br />\na clear possibility that we would<br />\nlook to places like Montgomery<br />\nCounty as a place to do<br />\nresearch,\" commented Bowie.<br />\nThe land which is now<br />\nWyman Park has had a long<br />\nand controversial history, and<br />\nin fact once belonged to the<br />\nUniversity. In 1902, six promi-<br />\n<br />\nnent Baltimoreans gave 181<br />\nacres to establish the<br />\nHomewood Campus and this<br />\nincluded what is now Wyman<br />\nPark. According to the Hamburger Archives, the following<br />\nyear, the trustees of Johns<br />\nHopkins gave the city 52 acres,<br />\nwhich were viewed as unneeded, to enlarge the park.<br />\nLater that decade, the<br />\nUniversity sold 8 more acres to<br />\nthe city at a nominal price to<br />\nfurther extend the park. In<br />\n1926, another six acres were<br />\ndonated for the building of the<br />\nart museum. Ironically,<br />\nHopkins gave the city more<br />\nland for Wyman Park than did<br />\nits original benefactor, William<br />\nWyman.<br />\nIn 1960, Milton Eisenhower<br />\nattempted to reacquire Wyman<br />\nPark to build new dormitories,<br />\nparking lots, and to relocate the<br />\nathletic field. At that time,<br />\nParks Board president Frank<br />\nMarino publicly described the<br />\nland as \"the least desirable\" in<br />\nthe park system. Although the<br />\nBoard unanimously voted to<br />\nsell Hopkins the land, community outcries forced revision<br />\nof the transaction. Instead of<br />\nthe 73 acres originally promised, Hopkins was allowed to<br />\npurchase only the thirty acres<br />\nbetweeen Stoney Run and San<br />\nMartin Drive.<br />\nFurther neighborhood opposition was voiced when the<br />\nUniversity then started to build<br />\non the land it had purchased. In<br />\n1980, with the construction of<br />\nOlin Hall, area residents protested the disturbance of the<br />\nopen space (even though<br />\nHopkins owned the land).<br />\nThe controversy continued<br />\nthis past summer as concerned<br />\ncitizens organized demonstrations to protest the sale of<br />\npublic park land. As a result,<br />\nMayor Schaefer is backing<br />\naway from the support he<br />\noriginally promised. Bowie<br />\nasserted, however, that the purchase of Wyman Park is \"by<br />\nno means a dead issue. The<br />\nUniversity is willing to work<br />\ntoward a compromise on this<br />\nthing that will give us more<br />\nbuildable land.\"<br />\nArea residents also plan to<br />\ncontinue efforts to block the<br />\ntransfer.

There<br />\nare<br />\nmany<br />\nwomen<br />\nat<br />\nHomewood, but there are few<br />\nopportunities for them to participate in setting the university's priorities or determining<br />\nthe tone of campus life.<br />\nAn extraordinary incident in<br />\nthe fall of 1984, involving the<br />\ncirculation of an obscene fraternity newsletter, served to focus<br />\nattention on the situation of<br />\nwomen at Homewood. In<br />\nresponse to that incident, Deans<br />\nFischer and VandeLinde appointed an Ad Hoc Committee<br />\non the Status of Women with a<br />\nbroad mandate to investigate<br />\nthe campus community and to<br />\nmake proposals for action. The<br />\nCommittee was composed of<br />\nmembers of the faculty, student<br />\nbody, administration, and staff<br />\nof the Homewood schools, and<br />\nwas requested to report by the<br />\n<br />\nments, and in the inclusion of<br />\nthe history and experience of<br />\nwomen in the curriculum. For<br />\nexample, a recent Census<br />\nBureau report notes that by<br />\n1982 women accounted for 52<br />\npercent of the nation's college<br />\nstudents. In 1983, 33.6 percent<br />\nof all doctoral degrees were<br />\nawarded to women. Moreover,<br />\nwomen now make up over 16<br />\npercent of the tenured and<br />\ntenure-track faculty of the top<br />\nfifty doctorate-granting universities in the Universities in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nYet few of these gains have<br />\nbeen reflected at Hopkins. For<br />\nsome years past, the representation of women in the student<br />\nbody as a whole, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate, has remained<br />\nconstant at approximately 33<br />\npercent. Only 7 percent of the<br />\ntenured and tenure-track faculty at Homewood are women.<br />\nThese numerical disparities<br />\nhave consequences: many<br />\nwomen faculty feel they constitute a small, uninfluential<br />\nand isolated minority, while<br />\nstudents, both men and<br />\nwomen, are hampered by the<br />\nlack of female role models and<br />\n<br />\nthe lack of attention to<br />\nwomen's issues on campus.<br />\nThe situation is even bleaker<br />\nfor minority women. they are<br />\nvirtually absent from the faculty and administration: only one<br />\nis a member of the tenure-track<br />\nfaculty, while two hold senior<br />\nadministrative posts. Less than<br />\nour<br />\nof<br />\npercent<br />\n6<br />\nundergraduates and less than 2<br />\npercent of our graduate<br />\nstudents are minority women.<br />\nAt Homewood, minority<br />\nwomen are to be found most<br />\noften in the lowest positions, as<br />\nmaintenance and food service<br />\nworkers.<br />\nIt is against this background,<br />\nand as a result of persistent expressions of concern about<br />\ngender and race inequalities in<br />\nall segments of the community,<br />\nthat the Ad Hoc Committee on<br />\nthe Status of Women began its<br />\nwork. It identified three<br />\nprimary areas of concern: (1)<br />\nthe working life of women in<br />\nstaff positions;(2) faculty hiring and curriculum development; (3) the need for a<br />\nwomen's center. Subcommittees were formed to consider<br />\neach of these issues; their findings and recommendations<br />\nhave been approved by the<br />\nCommittee as a whole. . .<br />\nThe Committee based its<br />\nconclusions on a number of<br />\n<br />\nOffice, and the Personnel Office. We interviewed faculty,<br />\ndeans, administrators, and<br />\ndepartment heads and met with<br />\nrepresentatives of interested<br />\ngroups, including the Student<br />\nCouncil, the counselors at the<br />\nWhite House, and a faculty<br />\ncommittee on curriculum<br />\ndevelopment. We distributed a<br />\nquestionnaire to Homewood<br />\nemployees which yielded a very<br />\nhigh return.<br />\nWe also gathered information about current efforts on<br />\nother campuses, collecting a<br />\nsmall library of materials on<br />\nfaculty hiring policies, women's<br />\ncenters, women's studies programs, personnell policies, etc.,<br />\nacross the country.

Department Chairmen, he said,<br />\nwere worried area majors had no<br />\nguidance.<br />\nAmong students, the complaints were<br />\nmuch harsher. The area majors were<br />\noften said to be easy ways to get a degree<br />\nwithout doing much work. Often they<br />\nwere.<br />\nThat was most unfortunate, for in<br />\nmany ways the area majors are the truest<br />\nand best kind of undergraduate major.<br />\nThey provide a rough focus (the social<br />\nsciences, say, or the humanities) while<br />\nallowing students a great deal of flexibility. That's really what an undergraduate<br />\neducation is all about.<br />\nThe committees, then, had an important task: to restructure the area majors<br />\nsuch that they become a more viable part<br />\nof the curriculum. All four of the panels<br />\nreported over the summer, but changes<br />\nhave actually been implemented in only<br />\ntwo of the programs: quanitative studies<br />\nand natural sciences.<br />\nThe change for quantitative studies<br />\nwas certainly the most drastic. The program was abolished. That isn't much of<br />\na loss, particularly considering that, as<br />\nthe committee noted in its report, only<br />\n<br />\nfour undergraduates currently list quantitative studies as their major.(The program's demise won't affect them; it only applies to students entering this fall.)<br />\nHaving around an area major with few<br />\nor no students could only serve to<br />\ndiscredit the other three. Far better to do<br />\na little housecleaning and create three<br />\nstrong and vital programs.<br />\nThe changes in the Natural Science<br />\nArea Major attempt to do just that. Requirements for 300-level courses have<br />\nbeen increased, a language requirement<br />\nhas been added and requirements for<br />\nspecific science and math courses have<br />\nbeen strengthened. The program has<br />\nalways been fairly large (harboring,<br />\namong other people, a lot of pre-meds),<br />\nbut it should now be fairly strong as well.<br />\nOne last note: while the work of the<br />\ncommittees which examined the area majors has been commendable, a complaint<br />\nfrom last spring ought to be reiterated.<br />\nThere should have been students on the<br />\npanels. When they were appointed, it<br />\nwas said committees of faculty members<br />\nand administrators were best able to<br />\nreview curriculum. Student input would<br />\nbe most welcome, we were all assured,<br />\nbut the committees themselves would be<br />\nclosed to students. That is absurd. It's<br />\nobvious that you can't expect significant<br />\nstudent input unless students are actually on the committees.<br />\nStill, the committees were right to bag<br />\nthe quantitative studies area major and<br />\nstrengthen the natural science one. It will<br />\nbe interesting to see what changes are<br />\nmade in the other two area majors. If<br />\nsensible decisions are made again, the<br />\narea majors could take their place as the<br />\nbest programs at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nDid you ever have to write a<br />\ndull paper on a dull topic?

The subject of<br />\nthis week's missive is<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nI'm sorry if I offended<br />\nanyone in my first column; no<br />\ninsult was intended. My reasons<br />\nfor the list were tenuous at best.<br />\nMy trustworthy Webster's<br />\ndefines stereotypes as \"an unvarying form or pattern.\" After<br />\nhaving accosted one hundred<br />\nfreshmen I made generalizations for the sake of humor and<br />\nfame.<br />\nStill, I owe an apology. A<br />\nminority does not construe an<br />\nunvarying pattern. I'd like to<br />\nsay that the ability to laugh at<br />\noneself makes life a lot<br />\neasier (especially at this place).<br />\nThe benefits of humorous selfevaluation is, in my opinion,<br />\ngreater than the costs. You<br />\nmight ask, \"And how, Gil, do<br />\nI know if I'm right for<br />\nhumorous self-evaluation.\"<br />\nWell, it has a lot to do with<br />\ntemperament and personality<br />\ntheory and I just won't go into<br />\nthat right now. I would like to<br />\npoint out the importance of the<br />\nembarrassment coefficient. If<br />\nyour e coefficient is low, you<br />\nembarrass very easily, and you<br />\nmight not at all feel comfortable laughing at yourself. A<br />\nperson of such psyche tends to<br />\nbe uptight and nervous. They<br />\nalmost never enter pie-eating<br />\ncontests. Maintaining a particular image is vital to such<br />\n<br />\n' Ief DOt<br />\n<br />\npeople and this characteristic<br />\nsometimes manifests itself as<br />\nvanity.<br />\nWhen I wrote the column in<br />\nquestion, I was laughing at<br />\nmyself two years ago just as this<br />\nyear's freshmen will (sooner<br />\nthan you think).<br />\nHumility is a useful virtue<br />\nwhen you're in a new place. I<br />\nremember being a freshman<br />\nand needing my advisor's<br />\nsignature to go to the<br />\nbathroom. Nothing has<br />\nchanged.<br />\nInstincts have always needed<br />\nexperience and it's only natural<br />\nthat the new kids on the block<br />\nare a tad short on that.<br />\nNow that the serious stuff is<br />\nout of the way and since I can<br />\nnow walk the freshman quad<br />\nwith relative safety, I'll address<br />\nstereotypes at Homewood.<br />\nI believe there exists one person who embodies each of the<br />\nfollowing descriptions and this<br />\nis why stereotypes are unfairly<br />\nconceived. Every so often the<br />\nmedia and our personal encounters bring us into contact<br />\nwith persons who are so lacking in character and personality that they really are<br />\nstereotypical. It is this very lack<br />\nof uniqueness which makes<br />\nthem unique. Now remember,<br />\nto say all \"whatevers\" are so is<br />\nan ungrounded stereotype and<br />\njust not nice.<br />\n1.

The first<br />\nis that fall break is not \"essentially meaningless.\" The second<br />\nis that we can never overemphasize that this situation<br />\nshould serve as a model and<br />\nmotivation to future student<br />\ninitiatives.<br />\nFall break is a big step in the<br />\nright direction for several<br />\n<br />\nreasons, the first being that it is<br />\na meaningful part of a revision<br />\nof the University calendar. One<br />\nchange is the addition of<br />\nreading days in the fall.<br />\nAnother is more a shift in<br />\npolicy: The University is no<br />\nlonger dogmatic about the<br />\ncalendar. Instead, it is now seen<br />\nby the administrators as a<br />\ndevice to work with to improve<br />\nstudent life.<br />\nThe second reason is the<br />\nvalue of fall break itself. The<br />\nbreak is just only for those who<br />\nchoose not to take advantage of<br />\nit. For everyone else, hopefully for everyone, it is an extend-<br />\n<br />\nOWt1Diktla 1M,ITS GOMA STAT TO krraCt<br />\n<br />\ned weekend with two alternatives. One is an opportunity<br />\nto leave campus and relax after<br />\nthe mid-term crunch. The other<br />\nis to stick around and take advantage of the biggest weekend,<br />\nsocially, of the tall semester on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe editorial was quite correct to point out that it is very<br />\nencouraging that the admresponded<br />\nnistration<br />\n\"remarkably quickly.\" But it<br />\nmust be understood that such a<br />\nquick response is one dealing<br />\nwith limited options. Only<br />\nminor changes can be made on<br />\nsuch short notice (even though<br />\nsmall changes can make a big<br />\ndifference). A longer weekend<br />\nor full-week break would require eliminating class days or<br />\nstarting the semester a full week<br />\nearlier. Both of these moves require an even closer look at the<br />\nproblem as well as more longrange planning.<br />\nTo label fall break as meaningless has quite a discouraging<br />\neffect on the students, faculty<br />\nand administrators who worked to make improvements in the<br />\ncalendar. The editorial correctly encourages students to take<br />\n\"an active role in improving the<br />\nUniversity.\" This example is<br />\nproof that if we students are<br />\nready to speak, the administration is willing to listen, and is<br />\nable to act on our initiatives. I<br />\nwant to encourage any student<br />\nwho perceives a problem<br />\nand/or has an idea to come to<br />\nthe council and we'll see what<br />\nhappens.<br />\nMeanwhile, however, fall<br />\nbreak is in no way a permanent<br />\nfixtui c iii tl.

The atmosphere is<br />\nred-checked tablecloths and<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nGoing to the Harbor or Little Italy for good food is possible, but often inconvenient.<br />\nWhat Hopkins students need is<br />\na good \"date\" restaurant at a<br />\nclose location replete with atmosphere, elegant cuisine and<br />\neverything you'd expect to find<br />\nin a city. For though we don't<br />\nlive in the chicest part of town,<br />\nwe deserve to raise our forks to<br />\nsomething more inspiring than<br />\na steak sub.<br />\nThe answer has arrived in the<br />\nform of Petros, a sophisticated<br />\nlittle Greek restaurant which<br />\ntook up residence in a converted Remington rowhouse<br />\nonly one month ago. Petros is<br />\nowned by its cook and has the<br />\nhallmarks of a real \"mom and<br />\npop\" place: warm, unpretentious service, and lavish detail<br />\npaid to authentic dishes. But<br />\nmost family-run businesses are<br />\nnot noted for elegance, which<br />\nis where Petros diverges from<br />\nthe flock.<br />\nThe whitewashed walls are<br />\nhung with Greek weavings,<br />\n.:rafts and paintings.

The picture takes place in<br />\nBaltimore in 1959 and centers<br />\naround the Fell's Point Diner,<br />\nsupposedly situated on the<br />\nshores of the harbor.<br />\nWell, the diner doesn't exist,<br />\nbut Fell's Point is a very real<br />\nplace, one of the oldest areas in<br />\nBaltimore as well as one of only two Federal historic<br />\nneighborhoods in the whole<br />\ncountry.<br />\nFell's Point, which includes<br />\nall of Broadway and the surrounding side streets south of<br />\nEastern Avenue, is just several<br />\nblocks east of the Inner Harbor. It retains today the appearance and charm from<br />\nalmost two centuries ago\u2014a<br />\ncollection of small specialty<br />\nshops, taverns, and excellent<br />\nrestaurants.<br />\nWhile the variety of the<br />\nshops is endless, those closest to<br />\nthe harbor tend to be antique<br />\nshops, specializing in marine<br />\ncuriousities. Art and frame<br />\nshops are also prevalent along<br />\n<br />\nTaster's<br />\n<br />\nwith book stores, jewelers,<br />\ngourmet shops, clothing boutiques, and ice cream parlors.<br />\nMost of the shops close at six,<br />\nso Saturday afternoon is the<br />\nbest time to explore the<br />\npossibilities these unique<br />\nestablishments provide.<br />\nLike the variety of shops, the<br />\nchoices of bars and taverns are<br />\nalso endless. I say bars and<br />\ntaverns because they both<br />\nexist\u2014as flashy disco bars with<br />\nblinking colored lights, mostly<br />\non the east side of Broadway<br />\nand small, as well as dark<br />\ntaverns with an obvious dockside air. Within the taverns the<br />\nflavor of the neighborhood is<br />\nheld. The interiors of some<br />\ncould be from a movie scene<br />\nwith two old sailors sharing sea<br />\ntales over a couple of grogs.<br />\nAnyway, they're also great<br />\nplaces to talk with friends over<br />\na basket of steamed shrimp and<br />\na pitcher of British ale.<br />\nWhile. Baltimore is famous<br />\nfor seafood, and there are<br />\nmany great seafood restaurants<br />\nin the city, some of the best<br />\nseafood can be found in the<br />\nrestaurants around Fell's Point.<br />\nThough crab in all its forms is<br />\nprobably the favorite seafood<br />\ndish in the city, mussels are a<br />\n<br />\nChoice<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshatt<br />\n<br />\npeople-watching. Downstairs<br />\ntoo is the bathroom, which<br />\nprobably has to be the cleanest<br />\none yet in Baltimore.<br />\nPetros' menu is comprised of<br />\n\u2022it reasonable number of dishes.<br />\nFor starters, Petros offers<br />\nwell-known as well as more<br />\nobscure Greek specialties.

The<br />\nsound system pipes out plaintive Greek melodies. The immersion is complete; the patron<br />\nis transported to the island of<br />\nMykonos, which is where the<br />\nrestaurant gets its name:<br />\nl'etros, a pelican, mysteriously<br />\nlanded in Mykonos and was<br />\nadopted as a symbol of the<br />\nisland.<br />\nAt the restaurant's door a<br />\nlarge pelican sculpture greets<br />\nyou, followed by a friendly, attentive staff.

Upstairs is more<br />\nsecluded and romantic, but<br />\ndownstairs provides for good<br />\n<br />\n1 avorite in Fell's Point. But the<br />\nrestaurants offer all varieties of<br />\nseafood prepared in any way<br />\nimaginable. The various<br />\nchowders, crab, mussel, and<br />\noyster, are often specialties of<br />\nthe house, but a side order of<br />\nmussels with melted butter is a<br />\nmust with all dinners.

The<br />\nArtichoke and Tomato Salad<br />\n($3.50) was a little heavy on<br />\n<br />\nvinaigrette but aside from that,<br />\nquite good.<br />\nThe price of entrees ranges<br />\nfrom $5.95 for Pastitsio, a<br />\nground beef and pasta<br />\ncasserole, to $12.95 for strip<br />\nsteak grilled and marinated<br />\nGreek style. Seafood is also<br />\navailable, ranging in price from<br />\nS7.95 for Kalamari, to grilled<br />\nlobster tail at $16.50. Most<br />\nmeat entrees start around<br />\n$8.00.<br />\nThe Souvlakia ($10.95) was a<br />\ngargantuan<br />\nserving<br />\nof<br />\nmarinated beef and pork pieces<br />\nroasted on skewers.

They gave us<br />\nthe Bee Gees; we gave them<br />\nDonna Summer.<br />\nAnd on it goes. In 1985,<br />\nthey're given us Wham! and<br />\nHoward Jones, and we've given<br />\nthem Madonna.<br />\nUnfortunately, there are a lot<br />\nof Americans who think most<br />\ncurrent British musicians are<br />\nwimps with synths. A lot of the<br />\nbest U.K. music never even gets<br />\nreleased in this country, leading<br />\nto understandable transAtlantic hostility among<br />\nenemies of disposable pop.<br />\nI've sent British pals tapes of<br />\nfine American groups like<br />\nR.E.M., Pylon, the Neats,<br />\nChrome, and Bunnydrums to<br />\nmake up for all that Prince and<br />\nMadonna on the B.B.C. In<br />\nreturn, I've learned about many<br />\nexcellent U.K. bands, including<br />\nthe kind that features guitars instead of synthesizers. Most of<br />\nthese artists are buried deep in<br />\nthe import bins, but it's worth<br />\na look.<br />\nHere's a rundown of some<br />\ncurrent favorites and their latest<br />\nvinyl output:<br />\nFirst, the granddaddies of<br />\nthem all, The Fall. This<br />\nvenerable band has been<br />\naround for nine years, and they<br />\nhave been extremely prolific,<br />\nreleasing a slew of albums and<br />\nsingles. Led by Mark E. Smith,<br />\n<br />\nThe abrasive Jesus and Mary Chain<br />\n<br />\nwho sneers at contemporary the British underground scene.<br />\nAmong Smth's spiritual heirs<br />\nBritish life, religion, and many<br />\nother matters in his lyrics (often are Yeah Yeah Noh, my<br />\nunintelligible), The Fall have favorite new band; the insert to<br />\nbecome a bit more accessible their album When 1 Am A Big<br />\nlately. This may be thanks to Girl describes them as \"Buddy<br />\nthe addition of Brix, Mark E.'s Holly meets The Fall.\" That's<br />\nCalifornian wife, to the line-up. not as far-fetched as it sounds.<br />\nThe Fall's latest record is a They are at times acerbic, but<br />\n12\" single, \"Couldn't Get their music is usually rollicking<br />\nAhead\"; it's not their best, but and fun. They have a spare<br />\nSmith is his usual dry, witty sound\u2014simply guitar, bass and<br />\nself, even dropping a reference drums on most tracks\u2014and<br />\nto E.T. A better bet is The Derek Hammond's vocals are<br />\nWonderful and Frightening very much in the forefront, ofWorld of The Fall, an LP fering social commentary on<br />\nreleased last year. It's got some tracks like \"Cottage Industry\"<br />\nvery powerful and innovative and \"1901\".<br />\nYeah Yeah Noh's latest<br />\nmusic, and while Smith's unconventional singing may take release is Mrs. Quill, which<br />\nsome getting used to, The Fall's sports a lime green jacket<br />\nuncompromising musical vision covered with purple psychedelic<br />\nis one of the leading forces in designs. Indeed, the song<br />\n<br />\nrepresents quite a change for<br />\nthe band. The mood is darker<br />\nthan in previous output, burying Hammond's voice in a<br />\nmore bass-heavy mix. Still, it's<br />\nan intense number, signaling an<br />\ninteresting new direction for the<br />\nband\u2014but what's that ersatz<br />\nsurf instrumental doing on the<br />\nB-side?<br />\nThe Three Johns are also<br />\npolitically conscious, leaning to<br />\nthe far, far left. They're Marxists, in fact, but don't let that<br />\nscare you. They do \"Like A<br />\nVirgin\" in concert and bound<br />\nmadly around the stage, obviously having a great time as<br />\nthey belt out tunes like<br />\n\"Workers of the World<br />\nUnite.\" A drum machine keeps<br />\ntime to the irreverent<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nSo far, the Johns have released several singles and an album,<br />\nAtorn Drum Bop. Among the<br />\nhighlights are a John F. Kennedy send-up, \"Dr. Freedom,\"<br />\nwhich makes fun of the president's famous butchering of the<br />\nGerman language, \"Ich bin<br />\neine Berliner\" (literally, \"I am<br />\na pastry\"). The Johns' music<br />\ndoes tend to run together after<br />\na while, but their high-spirited<br />\nrock is infectious even if their<br />\npolitics aren't.<br />\nAnother guitar-bass-drum<br />\nmachine combo is Red Lorry<br />\nYellow Lorry, whose lead<br />\nvocalist sounds as stark and<br />\ngloomy as their record covers<br />\n(invariable pitch black with<br />\nwhite lettering.) The Lorries<br />\nscored my nomination for<br />\n1984's most perfect single,<br />\n\"Monkey's on Juice,\" which<br />\ncomes at you like a speeding<br />\n<br />\ntrain with its propulsive beat.<br />\nAfter three amazing singles, including \"Monkeys,\" their LP,<br />\nTalk About the Weather, came<br />\nas something of a disappointment; Red Lorry Yellow Lorry<br />\nfunction much better as a<br />\nsingles band, where they can<br />\nchurn out three-minute bursts<br />\nof power and passion at 45<br />\nr.p.m. Still, the irony of that<br />\ndour-voiced singer intoning<br />\n\"I'm happy, yes I'm happy\"<br />\nover and over on Talk About<br />\nThe Weather's \"Happy\" provides a rare moment of levity<br />\namong the Lorries' dark musings, intended or not.<br />\nHidden somewhere behind a<br />\nwailing wall of feedback are the<br />\nsimple pop tunes of The Jesus<br />\nand Mary Chain. But it takes a<br />\npretty close listening and a very<br />\nopen mind to discern ther<br />\nmelodies. Each of their three<br />\nsingles have featured so much<br />\nguitar feedback that the uninformed probably figure they<br />\nwere simply having technical<br />\ndifficulties. Obviously, The<br />\nJesus and Mary Chain aren't<br />\nfor everyone, but it can be fun<br />\nto crank 'em up loud and see if<br />\nthe room clears. Their latest<br />\nrecord is a 12\",\"You Trip Me<br />\nUp,\" and they're threatening to<br />\npresent the world with a whole<br />\nLP of their stuff.<br />\nBesides these five, the U.K.<br />\nhas produced many more excellent guitar-based rockers\u2014<br />\nThe Woodentops, the March<br />\nViolets, Microdisney, Killing<br />\nJoke, and the ever-popular<br />\nSmiths, to name just a few.<br />\nThink of them the next time<br />\nBoy George assaults your sanity on radio.<br />\n<br />\nThesmophoriazusae: An Old, Old Classic<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\n\"0 Theoi, tin es gain barbaron<br />\naphigmetha takhei pedilo?\"<br />\nHuh? Where the hell am I?<br />\nEuripides 'flys\"onto the stage<br />\nwearing airplane wings on his<br />\narms. There is rubber head attached to one of the wings.

But the<br />\nairplane wings...<br />\n<br />\nThe<br />\nscene<br />\nis<br />\nfrom<br />\nAristophanes'<br />\nThesmophoriazusae and<br />\ncould<br />\nbe found being performed<br />\nTuesday night in the Barn<br />\nTheatre by the King's College<br />\nLondon Touring Company\u2014<br />\nperformed almost entirely in<br />\nthe original classical Greek.<br />\nPerhaps the first question<br />\nthat should be raised is<br />\n\"Why?\" Why perform a play<br />\nin classical Greek, a language<br />\neven deader than Latin, a<br />\nlanguage which, especially in<br />\nAmerica, is understood only by<br />\n<br />\nprofessors of classics(and even<br />\nthen, only in the written form?)<br />\nWhy perform a play whose<br />\ndialogue will be totally<br />\nunintelligible to the majority of<br />\nits audience?<br />\nYou might just as well ask,<br />\nhowever, why people go to<br />\nItalian operas or why<br />\nwesterners in Japan flock to the<br />\nKabuki. Somehow it is not<br />\ncrucial to understand what is<br />\nbeing said. \"Sure,\" an opponent might say, \"But the opera<br />\nhas great music and singing and<br />\nthe Kabuki has beauty and<br />\ngrace. Aristophanes is a comic<br />\nand most of the plays' wit is<br />\nfound in the dialogue.\" True,<br />\nbut it is still funny. And there<br />\nis a certain amount of good<br />\nmusic and grace and beauty as<br />\nwell.<br />\nOf course there is the<br />\n\"other\" reason at work here<br />\ntoo; that is, it is an effort to<br />\nrestore to life a play and a<br />\nlanguage\u2014a culture, for that<br />\nmatter.There is definitely an<br />\n\"archaeological fascination\"<br />\ninvolved with watching a play<br />\nperformed in Ancient Greek. It<br />\nis a bit like handling an old<br />\ntreek urn\u2014you think to<br />\nyourself, \"Gee, some,,ne 2500<br />\nyears ago handled this urn<br />\ntoo.\" While watching the play<br />\nyou think,\"Gee, someone 2400<br />\n<br />\nyears ago watched this play<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nAristophanes<br />\nwrote<br />\nThesmophoriazusae, or \"The<br />\nWomen Celebrating the<br />\nThesmophoria,\" in 411 B.C.<br />\nHe was a contemporary of both<br />\nEuripides, the playwright of<br />\nwhom he makes fun, and<br />\nSocrates, who is lampooned in<br />\nAristophanes' The Clouds.<br />\nCertainly it is thrilling to be immersed in a genuine cultural artifact from the Golden Age of<br />\nGreece.<br />\nThe play as performed by the<br />\nKing's College players is not<br />\nprimarily, however, an<br />\nacademic exercise. Certainly<br />\nThesmophoriazusae is not one<br />\nof Aristophanes' better-known<br />\nplays or better plays period.<br />\nThere is a sense in which they<br />\nhave tried primarily to hit on<br />\nuniversal themes. The play is<br />\nbilled<br />\nas<br />\na<br />\n\"fashion<br />\nspectacle\u2014thrills\u2014<br />\nfeminism\u2014dialectics\u2014sexual<br />\ndeviancy\u2014laughs\u2014laughs\u2014<br />\nlaughs.\" The main context is a<br />\nbattle of the sexes, certainly not<br />\nirrelevant to the present age,<br />\nwith some characters left in the<br />\nmiddle\u2014corresponding to the<br />\npresent tide of androgyny. It is<br />\nmost effective in revealing that<br />\neven in 5th Century Greece,<br />\nwomen were asserting their<br />\n<br />\nauthority. With these themes at<br />\nthe forefront the plot and<br />\ndialogue are just secondary<br />\ncomponents.<br />\nNot that the play doesn't<br />\nhave a plot. Simply put, the action is as follows: Euripides is<br />\nvery worried that the assembly<br />\nof women at the Festival of<br />\nDemeter and Persephone will<br />\nseek revenge on him for his<br />\nunflattering presentation of<br />\ntheir sex. Euripides and his<br />\ncousin Mnesilochus go to the<br />\nvery effeminate dramatist<br />\nAgathon to convince him to infiltrate the assembly (since he<br />\nalready looks like a woman)<br />\nand defend Euripides. Agathon<br />\nrefuses and Mnesilochus goes<br />\ninstead, clean-shaven and wearwig.<br />\nAgathon's<br />\ning<br />\nMnesilochus is thereupon<br />\ndiscovered when he defends<br />\nEuripides and points out the<br />\nfaults of the female sex, and is<br />\ncaptured. In two separate attempts to rescue Mnesilochus,<br />\nEuripides comes on the scene<br />\nand, in an attempt to fool the<br />\ncaptors, the two of them act out<br />\nEuripides'<br />\nscenes from<br />\ndramas\u2014first from Helen, with<br />\nEuripides as Menelaus and his<br />\ncousin as Helen, and then<br />\nMnesilochus as Andromeda.<br />\nWhen this fails, Euripides<br />\nbrings a dancing girl to lure<br />\n<br />\naway the \"policeman\" guarding Mnesilochus. This succeeds and the play ends.<br />\nThe touring company should<br />\nbe lauded for their efforts in<br />\nthis production. Not only did<br />\neveryone have to learn their<br />\nlines in Greek, they also had to<br />\nrecite them convincingly<br />\n(although with British accents.)<br />\nThey also showed, especially in<br />\nthe choruses and the Euripidean segments, how beautifulsounding a language Greek<br />\ncould be. Furthermore they<br />\nspiced up the humor a bit by<br />\nadding modern props, such as<br />\na scooter for EuripidesMenelaus, and modern sound<br />\neffects, such as EuripidesMenelaus crashing his scooter.<br />\nIn addition, the chorus-dance<br />\nnumbers were quite nice, if not<br />\nauthentic (though who knows?)<br />\nTuesday night was the second stop of the touring company's<br />\nsix-stop<br />\nNorth<br />\nAmerican tour.

Lee<br />\nIt was a warm pleasant day<br />\nlast Tuesday. One of those days<br />\nwhen you think summer will<br />\nstay in Baltimore for just one<br />\nmore week. That day, the<br />\nwomen's cross country team<br />\ntraveled downtown to compete<br />\nagainst division II school, The<br />\nUniversity of Maryland in<br />\nBaltimore County (UMBC).<br />\nGetting off the bus, the lady<br />\nJays were all smiles. They had<br />\nconfidence in their hearts, and<br />\nwings on their feet. They could<br />\nnot lose.<br />\nFor the lady harriers it was a<br />\nquick, satisfying meet. They<br />\nzipped in and they zipped out.<br />\nAll that remained was a stunned UMBC squad muttering to<br />\nthemselves, \"What 'appened?\"<br />\nThe Magnificent Seven had<br />\nstruck again.<br />\nLeading from the gun, senior<br />\nMaureen Shea had the arduous<br />\ntask of setting pace while correctly negotiating the course.<br />\nThe first mile was downhill,<br />\nand many of the harriers blazed through in sub-6 minute<br />\nmiles. Following Shea's lead<br />\nwere Molly Bardsley, Suzi<br />\nMcGinn, and co-captain/Orgo<br />\nlab student extraordinaire<br />\nCecilia King.<br />\nOn the second mile, the runners dropped off their earlier<br />\nrate as the course leveled off.<br />\nNevertheless, the pace remained quick throughout the race as<br />\nShea broke the tape in 19:03.<br />\nBehind Shea were Bardsley in<br />\n18:26, McGinn in 18:34, King<br />\nin 18:49 and Tami Oki in 19:09.<br />\nRounding out the top finishers<br />\nwere Sindee Gozansky and<br />\nAmita Kim, in 7th and 8th<br />\nplaces respectively.<br />\nThe Magnificent Seven had<br />\nmanaged the best score possible<br />\nof 15 points by having 5 runners finish the fast course<br />\nbefore the first runner from<br />\nUMBC crossed the line. If not<br />\nfor this lone UMBC runner<br />\ncoming in 6th place, the Jays<br />\nwould have recorded a shutout.<br />\nFor those who are perplexed<br />\nabout the intricacies of cross<br />\ncountry scoring, think of the<br />\nJays' feat as equivalent to a<br />\n<br />\nDwight Gooden no hitter that<br />\nis ruined in the bottom of the<br />\nninth by a base-hit.<br />\nIndicative of the Jays'<br />\noutstanding performance were<br />\nthe fast times run. Helped by a<br />\nquick course, this is the first<br />\nmeet that any Hopkins runner ran sub 20:00 for a 3.0 mile<br />\ncourse, let alone seven runners.<br />\nAlso occurring at this meet<br />\nwere the setting of many personal records such as McGinn's<br />\n18:34 for the course.<br />\nObviously, this year's squad<br />\nhas considerably more talent<br />\nthan in previous years. Running here last year, King was first<br />\nfor the Jays in 18:51; this year,<br />\nhowever,the co-captain ran two<br />\nseconds faster than last and only finished fourth. The<br />\nrenaissance in Hopkins' crosscOuntry is due to the sudden<br />\npresence of senior Shea as well<br />\nas the appearance of frosh<br />\nMcGinn and Bardsley.<br />\nTop runner for the Jays,<br />\nShea is an emotional one whose<br />\nreaction to competition is nervousness. Fortunately, Shea is<br />\nable to use this tension to her<br />\nadvantage by converting it into energy that creates a scorching pace.<br />\nShea is followed closely by<br />\nBardsley, who Coach Gary<br />\nGreen describes as being the<br />\n\"classic cross-country runner.\"<br />\nBardsley is a tough competitor<br />\nwho constantly adapts to the<br />\never-changing conditions on the<br />\ncourse. Joining Bardsley is<br />\nfellow frosh Suzi McGinn.<br />\nMcGinn, who is new to the<br />\nsport, has established her competitive edge through years of<br />\ntrack experience in New York<br />\nstate.<br />\nWith such a group of<br />\nnewcomers spearheading the<br />\nMagnificent Seven, the Jays are<br />\nlooking forward to this Saturday when they face strong<br />\nteams from Swarthmore and<br />\nHaverford, as well as a team<br />\nfrom Cedar Crest.

Since the area is a<br />\nfloodplain, neighbors are concerned about changes in the<br />\nwater level resulting from<br />\nfuture development, and want<br />\nto know who will be responsible for any damage as a result<br />\nof future floods.<br />\nFears were also expressed<br />\nthat the University would use<br />\nthe land for secret, potentially<br />\nhazardous, or military research.<br />\nBowie answered this worry with<br />\na resounding \"No.\" \"The<br />\nuniversity has an absolute<br />\npolicy against any classified<br />\nresearch on this campus,\" he<br />\nmaintained.<br />\nResidents also pointed out<br />\nthat the proposed facilities<br />\nwould increase traffic in an<br />\nalready congested area. The City is now forming a task force<br />\nto examine these grievances and<br />\nto look for a just settlement.<br />\nHopkins considered obtaining Wyman Park after Mayor<br />\nSchaefer, during a budget hearing earlier this year, informally proposed the idea of making<br />\nthe land available to the<br />\nUniversity to expand the Space<br />\nTelescope Science Institute.<br />\nViewing the mayor's remarks as<br /><br />\na promise of support, Hopkins<br />\nofficials proceeded and had architects build a scale model of<br />\nthe proposed research facilities.<br />\nThis model was available for inspection by area residents last<br />\nAugust.<br />\nIn the July 19 Sun, Dagmar<br />\nMiller, president of the Wyman<br />\nPark Community Association,<br />\nexpressed the neighborhood's<br />\ndiscontent. \"I can't blame<br />\nHopkins for doing what it's doing, and I don't argue with the<br />\nvalue of Hopkins as a major<br />\nemployer and asset to the<br />\nneighborhood. What really<br />\nangers me is the mayor baiting<br />\nthem into asking for the rest of<br />\nthe park,\" she explained.<br />\nHopkins officials believe that<br />\nthe many benefits the development will bring outweigh the<br />\nnegative aspects. The current<br />\nproposal will provide more jobs<br />\nand the community will reap<br />\nthese economic advantages.<br />\nMuch of the land will remain<br />\nuntouched, according to<br />\nBowie, and Hopkins will take<br />\non the responsibility of maintaining it. \"We really don't<br />\nthink the rest of this [land] is<br />\nbuildable, but by owning it, we<br />\nthink we can upgrade it and<br />\nreally make it usable for<br />\neveryone,\" he added.<br />\nHopkins is presently considering only two building sites<br />\non the property and the chance<br />\nof future development is very<br />\nslim. \"I just don't think that<br />\n[further construction] is in the<br />\ncards,\" commented Bowie.<br />\n\"The topography just does not<br />\nlend itself to doing anything<br />\nreasonable.\" The steep slopes<br />\nin part of the park and the flow<br />\nof the stream limit building to<br />\na site on the extreme northern<br />\nend of Wyman Park and to the<br />\nsouth, near Olin Hall, according to Bowie.<br />\nAnother possibility, which<br />\nthe mayor is trying to prevent<br />\nis for Hopkins to build outside<br />\nof Baltimore City. Expansion is<br />\nnecessary and while the University would prefer to extend the<br />\nHomewood Campus, \"there is<br />\na clear possibility that we would<br />\nlook to places like Montgomery<br />\nCounty as a place to do<br />\nresearch,\" commented Bowie.<br />\nThe land which is now<br />\nWyman Park has had a long<br />\nand controversial history, and<br />\nin fact once belonged to the<br />\nUniversity. In 1902, six promi-<br /><br />\nnent Baltimoreans gave 181<br />\nacres to establish the<br />\nHomewood Campus and this<br />\nincluded what is now Wyman<br />\nPark. According to the Hamburger Archives, the following<br />\nyear, the trustees of Johns<br />\nHopkins gave the city 52 acres,<br />\nwhich were viewed as unneeded, to enlarge the park.<br />\nLater that decade, the<br />\nUniversity sold 8 more acres to<br />\nthe city at a nominal price to<br />\nfurther extend the park. In<br />\n1926, another six acres were<br />\ndonated for the building of the<br />\nart museum. Ironically,<br />\nHopkins gave the city more<br />\nland for Wyman Park than did<br />\nits original benefactor, William<br />\nWyman.<br />\nIn 1960, Milton Eisenhower<br />\nattempted to reacquire Wyman<br />\nPark to build new dormitories,<br />\nparking lots, and to relocate the<br />\nathletic field. At that time,<br />\nParks Board president Frank<br />\nMarino publicly described the<br />\nland as \"the least desirable\" in<br />\nthe park system. Although the<br />\nBoard unanimously voted to<br />\nsell Hopkins the land, community outcries forced revision<br />\nof the transaction. Instead of<br />\nthe 73 acres originally promised, Hopkins was allowed to<br />\npurchase only the thirty acres<br />\nbetweeen Stoney Run and San<br />\nMartin Drive.<br />\nFurther neighborhood opposition was voiced when the<br />\nUniversity then started to build<br />\non the land it had purchased. In<br />\n1980, with the construction of<br />\nOlin Hall, area residents protested the disturbance of the<br />\nopen space (even though<br />\nHopkins owned the land).<br />\nThe controversy continued<br />\nthis past summer as concerned<br />\ncitizens organized demonstrations to protest the sale of<br />\npublic park land. As a result,<br />\nMayor Schaefer is backing<br />\naway from the support he<br />\noriginally promised. Bowie<br />\nasserted, however, that the purchase of Wyman Park is \"by<br />\nno means a dead issue. The<br />\nUniversity is willing to work<br />\ntoward a compromise on this<br />\nthing that will give us more<br />\nbuildable land.\"<br />\nArea residents also plan to<br />\ncontinue efforts to block the<br />\ntransfer. In any event the legal<br />\nbattle over the park will probably entail a long, tedious<br />\nprocess.<br /><br />\nMonday Nite<br />\n12 oz Char-Broiled<br />\nSirloin Steak<br />\nSalad<br />\nSully Fries<br />\n4,444<br />\n$6.95<br />\nKitchen open till 1 a.m.<br /><br />\nReplace Your Glasses With<br /><br />\nCONTACT LENSES<br />\nThere's a Contact Lens For You For Studying, Any Sports<br />\nActivity or Just Looking Your Best.

There<br />\nare<br />\nmany<br />\nwomen<br />\nat<br />\nHomewood, but there are few<br />\nopportunities for them to participate in setting the university's priorities or determining<br />\nthe tone of campus life.<br />\nAn extraordinary incident in<br />\nthe fall of 1984, involving the<br />\ncirculation of an obscene fraternity newsletter, served to focus<br />\nattention on the situation of<br />\nwomen at Homewood. In<br />\nresponse to that incident, Deans<br />\nFischer and VandeLinde appointed an Ad Hoc Committee<br />\non the Status of Women with a<br />\nbroad mandate to investigate<br />\nthe campus community and to<br />\nmake proposals for action. The<br />\nCommittee was composed of<br />\nmembers of the faculty, student<br />\nbody, administration, and staff<br />\nof the Homewood schools, and<br />\nwas requested to report by the<br /><br />\nments, and in the inclusion of<br />\nthe history and experience of<br />\nwomen in the curriculum. For<br />\nexample, a recent Census<br />\nBureau report notes that by<br />\n1982 women accounted for 52<br />\npercent of the nation's college<br />\nstudents. In 1983, 33.6 percent<br />\nof all doctoral degrees were<br />\nawarded to women. Moreover,<br />\nwomen now make up over 16<br />\npercent of the tenured and<br />\ntenure-track faculty of the top<br />\nfifty doctorate-granting universities in the Universities in the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nYet few of these gains have<br />\nbeen reflected at Hopkins. For<br />\nsome years past, the representation of women in the student<br />\nbody as a whole, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate, has remained<br />\nconstant at approximately 33<br />\npercent. Only 7 percent of the<br />\ntenured and tenure-track faculty at Homewood are women.<br />\nThese numerical disparities<br />\nhave consequences: many<br />\nwomen faculty feel they constitute a small, uninfluential<br />\nand isolated minority, while<br />\nstudents, both men and<br />\nwomen, are hampered by the<br />\nlack of female role models and<br /><br />\nthe lack of attention to<br />\nwomen's issues on campus.<br />\nThe situation is even bleaker<br />\nfor minority women. they are<br />\nvirtually absent from the faculty and administration: only one<br />\nis a member of the tenure-track<br />\nfaculty, while two hold senior<br />\nadministrative posts. Less than<br />\nour<br />\nof<br />\npercent<br />\n6<br />\nundergraduates and less than 2<br />\npercent of our graduate<br />\nstudents are minority women.<br />\nAt Homewood, minority<br />\nwomen are to be found most<br />\noften in the lowest positions, as<br />\nmaintenance and food service<br />\nworkers.<br />\nIt is against this background,<br />\nand as a result of persistent expressions of concern about<br />\ngender and race inequalities in<br />\nall segments of the community,<br />\nthat the Ad Hoc Committee on<br />\nthe Status of Women began its<br />\nwork. It identified three<br />\nprimary areas of concern: (1)<br />\nthe working life of women in<br />\nstaff positions;(2) faculty hiring and curriculum development; (3) the need for a<br />\nwomen's center. Subcommittees were formed to consider<br />\neach of these issues; their findings and recommendations<br />\nhave been approved by the<br />\nCommittee as a whole. . .<br />\nThe Committee based its<br />\nconclusions on a number of<br /><br />\nOffice, and the Personnel Office. We interviewed faculty,<br />\ndeans, administrators, and<br />\ndepartment heads and met with<br />\nrepresentatives of interested<br />\ngroups, including the Student<br />\nCouncil, the counselors at the<br />\nWhite House, and a faculty<br />\ncommittee on curriculum<br />\ndevelopment.

Department Chairmen, he said,<br />\nwere worried area majors had no<br />\nguidance.<br />\nAmong students, the complaints were<br />\nmuch harsher. The area majors were<br />\noften said to be easy ways to get a degree<br />\nwithout doing much work. Often they<br />\nwere.<br />\nThat was most unfortunate, for in<br />\nmany ways the area majors are the truest<br />\nand best kind of undergraduate major.<br />\nThey provide a rough focus (the social<br />\nsciences, say, or the humanities) while<br />\nallowing students a great deal of flexibility. That's really what an undergraduate<br />\neducation is all about.<br />\nThe committees, then, had an important task: to restructure the area majors<br />\nsuch that they become a more viable part<br />\nof the curriculum. All four of the panels<br />\nreported over the summer, but changes<br />\nhave actually been implemented in only<br />\ntwo of the programs: quanitative studies<br />\nand natural sciences.<br />\nThe change for quantitative studies<br />\nwas certainly the most drastic. The program was abolished. That isn't much of<br />\na loss, particularly considering that, as<br />\nthe committee noted in its report, only<br /><br />\nfour undergraduates currently list quantitative studies as their major.(The program's demise won't affect them; it only applies to students entering this fall.)<br />\nHaving around an area major with few<br />\nor no students could only serve to<br />\ndiscredit the other three. Far better to do<br />\na little housecleaning and create three<br />\nstrong and vital programs.<br />\nThe changes in the Natural Science<br />\nArea Major attempt to do just that. Requirements for 300-level courses have<br />\nbeen increased, a language requirement<br />\nhas been added and requirements for<br />\nspecific science and math courses have<br />\nbeen strengthened. The program has<br />\nalways been fairly large (harboring,<br />\namong other people, a lot of pre-meds),<br />\nbut it should now be fairly strong as well.<br />\nOne last note: while the work of the<br />\ncommittees which examined the area majors has been commendable, a complaint<br />\nfrom last spring ought to be reiterated.<br />\nThere should have been students on the<br />\npanels. When they were appointed, it<br />\nwas said committees of faculty members<br />\nand administrators were best able to<br />\nreview curriculum. Student input would<br />\nbe most welcome, we were all assured,<br />\nbut the committees themselves would be<br />\nclosed to students. That is absurd. It's<br />\nobvious that you can't expect significant<br />\nstudent input unless students are actually on the committees.<br />\nStill, the committees were right to bag<br />\nthe quantitative studies area major and<br />\nstrengthen the natural science one. It will<br />\nbe interesting to see what changes are<br />\nmade in the other two area majors. If<br />\nsensible decisions are made again, the<br />\narea majors could take their place as the<br />\nbest programs at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nDid you ever have to write a<br />\ndull paper on a dull topic?

Both are<br />\nwell-known men who should draw some<br />\nattention.<br />\nIt's true that there will also be some<br />\nduds\u2014an unnamed Soviet official, who<br />\nought to be about as interesting as Soviet<br />\nofficials always are (i.e. a yawner), Han<br />\nXu, the Chinese Ambassador to the<br />\nUnited States, who doesn't exactly have<br />\na big following, and Paul Nitze, who is<br />\none of the most interesting men alive but<br />\nwho has spoken at Hopkins far too<br />\noften\u2014but in general the quality of the<br />\nspeakers seems much improved.<br />\nAn ingenious format change, whereby<br />\ndiffering views on an issue will be offered<br />\nin successive lectures, should also enliven<br />\nthe series.<br />\nThe topic\u2014arms control\u2014is still .a bit<br />\nlimited for our tastes, but the symposium<br />\nin general looks improved.

The subject of<br />\nthis week's missive is<br />\nstereotypes.<br />\nI'm sorry if I offended<br />\nanyone in my first column; no<br />\ninsult was intended. My reasons<br />\nfor the list were tenuous at best.<br />\nMy trustworthy Webster's<br />\ndefines stereotypes as \"an unvarying form or pattern.\" After<br />\nhaving accosted one hundred<br />\nfreshmen I made generalizations for the sake of humor and<br />\nfame.<br />\nStill, I owe an apology. A<br />\nminority does not construe an<br />\nunvarying pattern. I'd like to<br />\nsay that the ability to laugh at<br />\noneself makes life a lot<br />\neasier (especially at this place).<br />\nThe benefits of humorous selfevaluation is, in my opinion,<br />\ngreater than the costs. You<br />\nmight ask, \"And how, Gil, do<br />\nI know if I'm right for<br />\nhumorous self-evaluation.\"<br />\nWell, it has a lot to do with<br />\ntemperament and personality<br />\ntheory and I just won't go into<br />\nthat right now. I would like to<br />\npoint out the importance of the<br />\nembarrassment coefficient. If<br />\nyour e coefficient is low, you<br />\nembarrass very easily, and you<br />\nmight not at all feel comfortable laughing at yourself. A<br />\nperson of such psyche tends to<br />\nbe uptight and nervous. They<br />\nalmost never enter pie-eating<br />\ncontests. Maintaining a particular image is vital to such<br /><br />\n' Ief DOt<br /><br />\npeople and this characteristic<br />\nsometimes manifests itself as<br />\nvanity.<br />\nWhen I wrote the column in<br />\nquestion, I was laughing at<br />\nmyself two years ago just as this<br />\nyear's freshmen will (sooner<br />\nthan you think).<br />\nHumility is a useful virtue<br />\nwhen you're in a new place. I<br />\nremember being a freshman<br />\nand needing my advisor's<br />\nsignature to go to the<br />\nbathroom. Nothing has<br />\nchanged.<br />\nInstincts have always needed<br />\nexperience and it's only natural<br />\nthat the new kids on the block<br />\nare a tad short on that.<br />\nNow that the serious stuff is<br />\nout of the way and since I can<br />\nnow walk the freshman quad<br />\nwith relative safety, I'll address<br />\nstereotypes at Homewood.<br />\nI believe there exists one person who embodies each of the<br />\nfollowing descriptions and this<br />\nis why stereotypes are unfairly<br />\nconceived. Every so often the<br />\nmedia and our personal encounters bring us into contact<br />\nwith persons who are so lacking in character and personality that they really are<br />\nstereotypical. It is this very lack<br />\nof uniqueness which makes<br />\nthem unique. Now remember,<br />\nto say all \"whatevers\" are so is<br />\nan ungrounded stereotype and<br />\njust not nice.<br />\n1.

The first<br />\nis that fall break is not \"essentially meaningless.\" The second<br />\nis that we can never overemphasize that this situation<br />\nshould serve as a model and<br />\nmotivation to future student<br />\ninitiatives.<br />\nFall break is a big step in the<br />\nright direction for several<br /><br />\nreasons, the first being that it is<br />\na meaningful part of a revision<br />\nof the University calendar. One<br />\nchange is the addition of<br />\nreading days in the fall.<br />\nAnother is more a shift in<br />\npolicy: The University is no<br />\nlonger dogmatic about the<br />\ncalendar. Instead, it is now seen<br />\nby the administrators as a<br />\ndevice to work with to improve<br />\nstudent life.<br />\nThe second reason is the<br />\nvalue of fall break itself. The<br />\nbreak is just only for those who<br />\nchoose not to take advantage of<br />\nit. For everyone else, hopefully for everyone, it is an extend-<br /><br />\nOWt1Diktla 1M,ITS GOMA STAT TO krraCt<br /><br />\ned weekend with two alternatives. One is an opportunity<br />\nto leave campus and relax after<br />\nthe mid-term crunch. The other<br />\nis to stick around and take advantage of the biggest weekend,<br />\nsocially, of the tall semester on<br />\ncampus.<br />\nThe editorial was quite correct to point out that it is very<br />\nencouraging that the admresponded<br />\nnistration<br />\n\"remarkably quickly.\" But it<br />\nmust be understood that such a<br />\nquick response is one dealing<br />\nwith limited options. Only<br />\nminor changes can be made on<br />\nsuch short notice (even though<br />\nsmall changes can make a big<br />\ndifference). A longer weekend<br />\nor full-week break would require eliminating class days or<br />\nstarting the semester a full week<br />\nearlier. Both of these moves require an even closer look at the<br />\nproblem as well as more longrange planning.<br />\nTo label fall break as meaningless has quite a discouraging<br />\neffect on the students, faculty<br />\nand administrators who worked to make improvements in the<br />\ncalendar. The editorial correctly encourages students to take<br />\n\"an active role in improving the<br />\nUniversity.\" This example is<br />\nproof that if we students are<br />\nready to speak, the administration is willing to listen, and is<br />\nable to act on our initiatives. I<br />\nwant to encourage any student<br />\nwho perceives a problem<br />\nand/or has an idea to come to<br />\nthe council and we'll see what<br />\nhappens.<br />\nMeanwhile, however, fall<br />\nbreak is in no way a permanent<br />\nfixtui c iii tl. University calendar. I agree that a longer break<br />\nwould be more effective and is<br />\nneeded.

Petros is<br />\nowned by its cook and has the<br />\nhallmarks of a real \"mom and<br />\npop\" place: warm, unpretentious service, and lavish detail<br />\npaid to authentic dishes. But<br />\nmost family-run businesses are<br />\nnot noted for elegance, which<br />\nis where Petros diverges from<br />\nthe flock.<br />\nThe whitewashed walls are<br />\nhung with Greek weavings,<br />\n.:rafts and paintings.

The picture takes place in<br />\nBaltimore in 1959 and centers<br />\naround the Fell's Point Diner,<br />\nsupposedly situated on the<br />\nshores of the harbor.<br />\nWell, the diner doesn't exist,<br />\nbut Fell's Point is a very real<br />\nplace, one of the oldest areas in<br />\nBaltimore as well as one of only two Federal historic<br />\nneighborhoods in the whole<br />\ncountry.<br />\nFell's Point, which includes<br />\nall of Broadway and the surrounding side streets south of<br />\nEastern Avenue, is just several<br />\nblocks east of the Inner Harbor. It retains today the appearance and charm from<br />\nalmost two centuries ago\u2014a<br />\ncollection of small specialty<br />\nshops, taverns, and excellent<br />\nrestaurants.<br />\nWhile the variety of the<br />\nshops is endless, those closest to<br />\nthe harbor tend to be antique<br />\nshops, specializing in marine<br />\ncuriousities. Art and frame<br />\nshops are also prevalent along<br /><br />\nTaster's<br /><br />\nwith book stores, jewelers,<br />\ngourmet shops, clothing boutiques, and ice cream parlors.<br />\nMost of the shops close at six,<br />\nso Saturday afternoon is the<br />\nbest time to explore the<br />\npossibilities these unique<br />\nestablishments provide.<br />\nLike the variety of shops, the<br />\nchoices of bars and taverns are<br />\nalso endless. I say bars and<br />\ntaverns because they both<br />\nexist\u2014as flashy disco bars with<br />\nblinking colored lights, mostly<br />\non the east side of Broadway<br />\nand small, as well as dark<br />\ntaverns with an obvious dockside air. Within the taverns the<br />\nflavor of the neighborhood is<br />\nheld. The interiors of some<br />\ncould be from a movie scene<br />\nwith two old sailors sharing sea<br />\ntales over a couple of grogs.<br />\nAnyway, they're also great<br />\nplaces to talk with friends over<br />\na basket of steamed shrimp and<br />\na pitcher of British ale.<br />\nWhile. Baltimore is famous<br />\nfor seafood, and there are<br />\nmany great seafood restaurants<br />\nin the city, some of the best<br />\nseafood can be found in the<br />\nrestaurants around Fell's Point.<br />\nThough crab in all its forms is<br />\nprobably the favorite seafood<br />\ndish in the city, mussels are a<br /><br />\nChoice<br /><br />\nJess Bunshatt<br /><br />\npeople-watching.

The various<br />\nchowders, crab, mussel, and<br />\noyster, are often specialties of<br />\nthe house, but a side order of<br />\nmussels with melted butter is a<br />\nmust with all dinners.

Mind if I pull<br />\na few interview questions from<br />\nyour copy?<br />\nJohn: No.<br />\nNews-Letter: I can sense that<br />\nyou're a little hesitant to open<br />\nup with some verbose answers,<br />\nhere's a question that I feel is<br />\nappropriate, it was originally<br />\ndirected at Tom Selleck: \"It's<br />\ntough being a sex symbol, eh?\"<br />\nJohn: Let me see that question.<br />\nHmm, I think there are some<br /><br />\nbetter examples of sex cvmhols<br />\nin here. [points to magazine]<br />\nNews-Letter: Ok,let's get on to<br />\nthe next Selleck question:<br />\n\"What does a sex symbol feel<br />\nlike?\"<br />\nJohn: I don't know, I really<br />\nhaven't gotten close enough to<br />\ntouch one. I'd say that, by my<br />\nclosest contact, it feels rather<br />\nt_vp-dimensional and glossy.<br />\nNews-Letter: What's it like to<br />\nbe a Housemaster?<br />\nJohn: They asked Tom Selleck<br />\nthat?<br />\nNews-Letter: No, as you can<br />\nsee, I'm not on that page.<br />\nJohn: Well, I feel that it has<br />\nbeen my most positive living experience at Hopkins, and much<br />\nbetter than living in the dorms<br />\nmy Freshman year. My roommate used to hold parties every<br />\nweeknight. I used to wake up to<br />\nthe scream of \"Hey! Quiet!<br />\nJohn's sleeping.\" Of course,<br />\neverybody was quite polite.<br /><br />\nWhenever they woke me up, at<br />\ntwo or three in the morning,<br />\nthey always offered me a beer.<br />\nWell, you ought to know all<br />\nwere<br />\nwe<br />\nRoger,<br />\nthis<br />\nroommates.<br />\nNews-Letter: You mean all that<br />\ntime, you were really asleep? I<br />\nthought you were just being<br />\nquiet.<br />\nJohn: Someone in that room<br />\nhad to be. Why, I remember<br />\nthat one time when you came<br />\nback at four in the morning,<br />\nwearing a...[John then went on<br />\nto make a totally irrelevent<br />\nobservation.]<br />\nNews-Letter: Ahem, I think our<br />\nreaders are more interested in<br />\nthis year, John, your year as<br />\nHousemaster.<br />\nJohn: What can I say? It's been<br />\na great year\u2014so far. My kids<br />\nare great, they do myhomework for me. They've<br />\nbeen able to help me out with<br />\nsome problems I've been having at home, and in fact, I feel<br />\nbetter adjusted and closer to my<br />\nown identity now, then at any<br />\ntime in my life. They've been<br />\nsuch a help.<br />\nNews-Letter: Then what are<br />\nyou getting free room and<br />\nboard for?<br />\nJohn: Free? Nobody told me<br />\nthis stuff was free. I paid<br />\neighteen-hundred dollars for<br />\nthis meal plan. I think I've got<br />\nto have a talk with Andrea<br />\nPerry.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND<br /><br />\nFAIRCHILD SCHOLARS<br />\nPROGRAM<br />\nA unique way to earn<br />\nyour M.S. or Ph.D. in<br />\nelectrical engineering.<br />\nWork 3 days a week at<br />\nfull salary; study 2 days a<br />\nweek under full<br />\nfellowship.<br />\nApply today if you have a<br />\nB.S.

Oh,<br />\nI've got one of those to go with<br />\nthe job.<br />\nNews-Letter: That's exactly the<br />\nquestion I'm trying to ask you.<br />\nYou just brought up what I<br />\nassume is a common question:<br />\nWhy do all of these things \"go<br />\nwith the job?\"<br />\nJohn: Obviously, so that I can<br />\nbe awaken at four in the morning to cook microwave popcorn, when the common kitchen is locked. It's a part of my<br />\njob description.<br />\nNews-Letter: Speaking of your<br />\njob description, there's a rumor<br />\ngoing around that all of the<br />\nHousemasters are required to<br />\nbabysit Andrea Perry's monthold baby at least one night a<br />\nmonth. Would you care to<br />\ncomment?<br />\nJohn: Where did you hear that<br />\nrumor?<br />\nNews-Letter: Well, I was hoping to start it right here.<br />\nJohn: No, that rumor is absolutely, undeniably false. All<br />\nkidding aside, I think it is great<br />\nthat there is a baby on<br />\ncampus\u2014outside of midterm<br />\ngripe sessions, that is. I think<br />\nAndrea makes a beautiful<br />\nmother. She is, without a<br />\ndoubt, a maternal master.<br />\nNews-Letter: A \"maternal<br />\nmaster,\" huh? By saying this<br />\ndo you hope Andrea will let you<br />\nout of babysitting this Friday<br />\nnight?<br />\nJohn: I think she owed me that<br />\nmuch, yes.<br />\nNews-Letter: What are your<br />\nplans for the future?<br />\nJohn: Well, I'd like to get married, have a few kids, have a<br />\nfew kids, have a few kids, have<br />\na few kids, have a few kids,<br /><br />\nNews-Letter: Hold on a second<br />\nJohn, the repeat key on this<br />\nword processor is broken.<br />\nAnyway, what are your plans<br />\nfor the immediate future?<br />\nJohn: Right now, I'm applying<br />\nto medical school.

No, I think it's one...<br />\nNo, now that I think of it,<br />\nUM...<br /><br />\nNews-Letter: Well, enough<br />\nabout that, John.

They gave us<br />\nthe Bee Gees; we gave them<br />\nDonna Summer.<br />\nAnd on it goes. In 1985,<br />\nthey're given us Wham! and<br />\nHoward Jones, and we've given<br />\nthem Madonna.<br />\nUnfortunately, there are a lot<br />\nof Americans who think most<br />\ncurrent British musicians are<br />\nwimps with synths. A lot of the<br />\nbest U.K. music never even gets<br />\nreleased in this country, leading<br />\nto understandable transAtlantic hostility among<br />\nenemies of disposable pop.<br />\nI've sent British pals tapes of<br />\nfine American groups like<br />\nR.E.M., Pylon, the Neats,<br />\nChrome, and Bunnydrums to<br />\nmake up for all that Prince and<br />\nMadonna on the B.B.C. In<br />\nreturn, I've learned about many<br />\nexcellent U.K. bands, including<br />\nthe kind that features guitars instead of synthesizers. Most of<br />\nthese artists are buried deep in<br />\nthe import bins, but it's worth<br />\na look.<br />\nHere's a rundown of some<br />\ncurrent favorites and their latest<br />\nvinyl output:<br />\nFirst, the granddaddies of<br />\nthem all, The Fall. This<br />\nvenerable band has been<br />\naround for nine years, and they<br />\nhave been extremely prolific,<br />\nreleasing a slew of albums and<br />\nsingles. Led by Mark E. Smith,<br /><br />\nThe abrasive Jesus and Mary Chain<br /><br />\nwho sneers at contemporary the British underground scene.<br />\nAmong Smth's spiritual heirs<br />\nBritish life, religion, and many<br />\nother matters in his lyrics (often are Yeah Yeah Noh, my<br />\nunintelligible), The Fall have favorite new band; the insert to<br />\nbecome a bit more accessible their album When 1 Am A Big<br />\nlately. This may be thanks to Girl describes them as \"Buddy<br />\nthe addition of Brix, Mark E.'s Holly meets The Fall.\" That's<br />\nCalifornian wife, to the line-up. not as far-fetched as it sounds.<br />\nThe Fall's latest record is a They are at times acerbic, but<br />\n12\" single, \"Couldn't Get their music is usually rollicking<br />\nAhead\"; it's not their best, but and fun. They have a spare<br />\nSmith is his usual dry, witty sound\u2014simply guitar, bass and<br />\nself, even dropping a reference drums on most tracks\u2014and<br />\nto E.T. A better bet is The Derek Hammond's vocals are<br />\nWonderful and Frightening very much in the forefront, ofWorld of The Fall, an LP fering social commentary on<br />\nreleased last year. It's got some tracks like \"Cottage Industry\"<br />\nvery powerful and innovative and \"1901\".<br />\nYeah Yeah Noh's latest<br />\nmusic, and while Smith's unconventional singing may take release is Mrs. Quill, which<br />\nsome getting used to, The Fall's sports a lime green jacket<br />\nuncompromising musical vision covered with purple psychedelic<br />\nis one of the leading forces in designs. Indeed, the song<br /><br />\nrepresents quite a change for<br />\nthe band. The mood is darker<br />\nthan in previous output, burying Hammond's voice in a<br />\nmore bass-heavy mix. Still, it's<br />\nan intense number, signaling an<br />\ninteresting new direction for the<br />\nband\u2014but what's that ersatz<br />\nsurf instrumental doing on the<br />\nB-side?<br />\nThe Three Johns are also<br />\npolitically conscious, leaning to<br />\nthe far, far left. They're Marxists, in fact, but don't let that<br />\nscare you. They do \"Like A<br />\nVirgin\" in concert and bound<br />\nmadly around the stage, obviously having a great time as<br />\nthey belt out tunes like<br />\n\"Workers of the World<br />\nUnite.\" A drum machine keeps<br />\ntime to the irreverent<br />\nproceedings.<br />\nSo far, the Johns have released several singles and an album,<br />\nAtorn Drum Bop. Among the<br />\nhighlights are a John F. Kennedy send-up, \"Dr. Freedom,\"<br />\nwhich makes fun of the president's famous butchering of the<br />\nGerman language, \"Ich bin<br />\neine Berliner\" (literally, \"I am<br />\na pastry\"). The Johns' music<br />\ndoes tend to run together after<br />\na while, but their high-spirited<br />\nrock is infectious even if their<br />\npolitics aren't.<br />\nAnother guitar-bass-drum<br />\nmachine combo is Red Lorry<br />\nYellow Lorry, whose lead<br />\nvocalist sounds as stark and<br />\ngloomy as their record covers<br />\n(invariable pitch black with<br />\nwhite lettering.) The Lorries<br />\nscored my nomination for<br />\n1984's most perfect single,<br />\n\"Monkey's on Juice,\" which<br />\ncomes at you like a speeding<br /><br />\ntrain with its propulsive beat.<br />\nAfter three amazing singles, including \"Monkeys,\" their LP,<br />\nTalk About the Weather, came<br />\nas something of a disappointment; Red Lorry Yellow Lorry<br />\nfunction much better as a<br />\nsingles band, where they can<br />\nchurn out three-minute bursts<br />\nof power and passion at 45<br />\nr.p.m. Still, the irony of that<br />\ndour-voiced singer intoning<br />\n\"I'm happy, yes I'm happy\"<br />\nover and over on Talk About<br />\nThe Weather's \"Happy\" provides a rare moment of levity<br />\namong the Lorries' dark musings, intended or not.<br />\nHidden somewhere behind a<br />\nwailing wall of feedback are the<br />\nsimple pop tunes of The Jesus<br />\nand Mary Chain. But it takes a<br />\npretty close listening and a very<br />\nopen mind to discern ther<br />\nmelodies. Each of their three<br />\nsingles have featured so much<br />\nguitar feedback that the uninformed probably figure they<br />\nwere simply having technical<br />\ndifficulties. Obviously, The<br />\nJesus and Mary Chain aren't<br />\nfor everyone, but it can be fun<br />\nto crank 'em up loud and see if<br />\nthe room clears. Their latest<br />\nrecord is a 12\",\"You Trip Me<br />\nUp,\" and they're threatening to<br />\npresent the world with a whole<br />\nLP of their stuff.<br />\nBesides these five, the U.K.<br />\nhas produced many more excellent guitar-based rockers\u2014<br />\nThe Woodentops, the March<br />\nViolets, Microdisney, Killing<br />\nJoke, and the ever-popular<br />\nSmiths, to name just a few.<br />\nThink of them the next time<br />\nBoy George assaults your sanity on radio.<br /><br />\nThesmophoriazusae: An Old, Old Classic<br />\nby Peter Oehlkers<br />\n\"0 Theoi, tin es gain barbaron<br />\naphigmetha takhei pedilo?\"<br />\nHuh? Where the hell am I?<br />\nEuripides 'flys\"onto the stage<br />\nwearing airplane wings on his<br />\narms. There is rubber head attached to one of the wings. A<br />\nrubber Gorgon 's head. \"Dia<br />\nmesou gar aitheros temnon<br />\nkeleuthon, poda tithem<br />\nupopteron, Perseus...\"<br />\nGorgon's head. Flying.<br />\nPerseus. Euripides? Must be<br />\nGreek. Mythology. But the<br />\nairplane wings...<br /><br />\nThe<br />\nscene<br />\nis<br />\nfrom<br />\nAristophanes'<br />\nThesmophoriazusae and<br />\ncould<br />\nbe found being performed<br />\nTuesday night in the Barn<br />\nTheatre by the King's College<br />\nLondon Touring Company\u2014<br />\nperformed almost entirely in<br />\nthe original classical Greek.<br />\nPerhaps the first question<br />\nthat should be raised is<br />\n\"Why?\" Why perform a play<br />\nin classical Greek, a language<br />\neven deader than Latin, a<br />\nlanguage which, especially in<br />\nAmerica, is understood only by<br /><br />\nprofessors of classics(and even<br />\nthen, only in the written form?)<br />\nWhy perform a play whose<br />\ndialogue will be totally<br />\nunintelligible to the majority of<br />\nits audience?<br />\nYou might just as well ask,<br />\nhowever, why people go to<br />\nItalian operas or why<br />\nwesterners in Japan flock to the<br />\nKabuki. Somehow it is not<br />\ncrucial to understand what is<br />\nbeing said. \"Sure,\" an opponent might say, \"But the opera<br />\nhas great music and singing and<br />\nthe Kabuki has beauty and<br />\ngrace. Aristophanes is a comic<br />\nand most of the plays' wit is<br />\nfound in the dialogue.\" True,<br />\nbut it is still funny. And there<br />\nis a certain amount of good<br />\nmusic and grace and beauty as<br />\nwell.<br />\nOf course there is the<br />\n\"other\" reason at work here<br />\ntoo; that is, it is an effort to<br />\nrestore to life a play and a<br />\nlanguage\u2014a culture, for that<br />\nmatter.There is definitely an<br />\n\"archaeological fascination\"<br />\ninvolved with watching a play<br />\nperformed in Ancient Greek. It<br />\nis a bit like handling an old<br />\ntreek urn\u2014you think to<br />\nyourself, \"Gee, some,,ne 2500<br />\nyears ago handled this urn<br />\ntoo.\" While watching the play<br />\nyou think,\"Gee, someone 2400<br /><br />\nyears ago watched this play<br />\ntoo.\"<br />\nAristophanes<br />\nwrote<br />\nThesmophoriazusae, or \"The<br />\nWomen Celebrating the<br />\nThesmophoria,\" in 411 B.C.<br />\nHe was a contemporary of both<br />\nEuripides, the playwright of<br />\nwhom he makes fun, and<br />\nSocrates, who is lampooned in<br />\nAristophanes' The Clouds.<br />\nCertainly it is thrilling to be immersed in a genuine cultural artifact from the Golden Age of<br />\nGreece.<br />\nThe play as performed by the<br />\nKing's College players is not<br />\nprimarily, however, an<br />\nacademic exercise. Certainly<br />\nThesmophoriazusae is not one<br />\nof Aristophanes' better-known<br />\nplays or better plays period.<br />\nThere is a sense in which they<br />\nhave tried primarily to hit on<br />\nuniversal themes. The play is<br />\nbilled<br />\nas<br />\na<br />\n\"fashion<br />\nspectacle\u2014thrills\u2014<br />\nfeminism\u2014dialectics\u2014sexual<br />\ndeviancy\u2014laughs\u2014laughs\u2014<br />\nlaughs.\" The main context is a<br />\nbattle of the sexes, certainly not<br />\nirrelevant to the present age,<br />\nwith some characters left in the<br />\nmiddle\u2014corresponding to the<br />\npresent tide of androgyny. It is<br />\nmost effective in revealing that<br />\neven in 5th Century Greece,<br />\nwomen were asserting their<br /><br />\nauthority. With these themes at<br />\nthe forefront the plot and<br />\ndialogue are just secondary<br />\ncomponents.<br />\nNot that the play doesn't<br />\nhave a plot. Simply put, the action is as follows: Euripides is<br />\nvery worried that the assembly<br />\nof women at the Festival of<br />\nDemeter and Persephone will<br />\nseek revenge on him for his<br />\nunflattering presentation of<br />\ntheir sex. Euripides and his<br />\ncousin Mnesilochus go to the<br />\nvery effeminate dramatist<br />\nAgathon to convince him to infiltrate the assembly (since he<br />\nalready looks like a woman)<br />\nand defend Euripides. Agathon<br />\nrefuses and Mnesilochus goes<br />\ninstead, clean-shaven and wearwig.<br />\nAgathon's<br />\ning<br />\nMnesilochus is thereupon<br />\ndiscovered when he defends<br />\nEuripides and points out the<br />\nfaults of the female sex, and is<br />\ncaptured. In two separate attempts to rescue Mnesilochus,<br />\nEuripides comes on the scene<br />\nand, in an attempt to fool the<br />\ncaptors, the two of them act out<br />\nEuripides'<br />\nscenes from<br />\ndramas\u2014first from Helen, with<br />\nEuripides as Menelaus and his<br />\ncousin as Helen, and then<br />\nMnesilochus as Andromeda.<br />\nWhen this fails, Euripides<br />\nbrings a dancing girl to lure<br /><br />\naway the \"policeman\" guarding Mnesilochus. This succeeds and the play ends.<br />\nThe touring company should<br />\nbe lauded for their efforts in<br />\nthis production. Not only did<br />\neveryone have to learn their<br />\nlines in Greek, they also had to<br />\nrecite them convincingly<br />\n(although with British accents.)<br />\nThey also showed, especially in<br />\nthe choruses and the Euripidean segments, how beautifulsounding a language Greek<br />\ncould be. Furthermore they<br />\nspiced up the humor a bit by<br />\nadding modern props, such as<br />\na scooter for EuripidesMenelaus, and modern sound<br />\neffects, such as EuripidesMenelaus crashing his scooter.<br />\nIn addition, the chorus-dance<br />\nnumbers were quite nice, if not<br />\nauthentic (though who knows?)<br />\nTuesday night was the second stop of the touring company's<br />\nsix-stop<br />\nNorth<br />\nAmerican tour.

Lee<br />\nIt was a warm pleasant day<br />\nlast Tuesday. One of those days<br />\nwhen you think summer will<br />\nstay in Baltimore for just one<br />\nmore week. That day, the<br />\nwomen's cross country team<br />\ntraveled downtown to compete<br />\nagainst division II school, The<br />\nUniversity of Maryland in<br />\nBaltimore County (UMBC).<br />\nGetting off the bus, the lady<br />\nJays were all smiles. They had<br />\nconfidence in their hearts, and<br />\nwings on their feet. They could<br />\nnot lose.<br />\nFor the lady harriers it was a<br />\nquick, satisfying meet. They<br />\nzipped in and they zipped out.<br />\nAll that remained was a stunned UMBC squad muttering to<br />\nthemselves, \"What 'appened?\"<br />\nThe Magnificent Seven had<br />\nstruck again.<br />\nLeading from the gun, senior<br />\nMaureen Shea had the arduous<br />\ntask of setting pace while correctly negotiating the course.<br />\nThe first mile was downhill,<br />\nand many of the harriers blazed through in sub-6 minute<br />\nmiles. Following Shea's lead<br />\nwere Molly Bardsley, Suzi<br />\nMcGinn, and co-captain/Orgo<br />\nlab student extraordinaire<br />\nCecilia King.<br />\nOn the second mile, the runners dropped off their earlier<br />\nrate as the course leveled off.<br />\nNevertheless, the pace remained quick throughout the race as<br />\nShea broke the tape in 19:03.<br />\nBehind Shea were Bardsley in<br />\n18:26, McGinn in 18:34, King<br />\nin 18:49 and Tami Oki in 19:09.<br />\nRounding out the top finishers<br />\nwere Sindee Gozansky and<br />\nAmita Kim, in 7th and 8th<br />\nplaces respectively.<br />\nThe Magnificent Seven had<br />\nmanaged the best score possible<br />\nof 15 points by having 5 runners finish the fast course<br />\nbefore the first runner from<br />\nUMBC crossed the line. If not<br />\nfor this lone UMBC runner<br />\ncoming in 6th place, the Jays<br />\nwould have recorded a shutout.<br />\nFor those who are perplexed<br />\nabout the intricacies of cross<br />\ncountry scoring, think of the<br />\nJays' feat as equivalent to a<br /><br />\nDwight Gooden no hitter that<br />\nis ruined in the bottom of the<br />\nninth by a base-hit.<br />\nIndicative of the Jays'<br />\noutstanding performance were<br />\nthe fast times run. Helped by a<br />\nquick course, this is the first<br />\nmeet that any Hopkins runner ran sub 20:00 for a 3.0 mile<br />\ncourse, let alone seven runners.<br />\nAlso occurring at this meet<br />\nwere the setting of many personal records such as McGinn's<br />\n18:34 for the course.<br />\nObviously, this year's squad<br />\nhas considerably more talent<br />\nthan in previous years. Running here last year, King was first<br />\nfor the Jays in 18:51; this year,<br />\nhowever,the co-captain ran two<br />\nseconds faster than last and only finished fourth. The<br />\nrenaissance in Hopkins' crosscOuntry is due to the sudden<br />\npresence of senior Shea as well<br />\nas the appearance of frosh<br />\nMcGinn and Bardsley.<br />\nTop runner for the Jays,<br />\nShea is an emotional one whose<br />\nreaction to competition is nervousness. Fortunately, Shea is<br />\nable to use this tension to her<br />\nadvantage by converting it into energy that creates a scorching pace.<br />\nShea is followed closely by<br />\nBardsley, who Coach Gary<br />\nGreen describes as being the<br />\n\"classic cross-country runner.\"<br />\nBardsley is a tough competitor<br />\nwho constantly adapts to the<br />\never-changing conditions on the<br />\ncourse.
