Far worse, however, is the fact that only 19 of the<br />\n329 Homewood faculty members \u2014 an ignominious 5.7% \u2014<br />\nwere willing to offer courses.<br />\nLast year's decision by the Academic Council to retain the<br />\nintersession program in its standing grade-credit format<br />\nseemed to portend good things, since the mandate opposed<br />\nsome vehement desires to see the program abrogated. The<br />\nherdic vote was heralded by Arts and Sciences potentates as a<br />\nsure augury of a quality 1975 intersession. But somewhere<br />\nalong the way to the Registrar's office, something happened.<br />\nIf Dean George Owen is \"shocked,\" one can just imagine how<br />\nthe students feel.<br />\nThough the unavoidable inference is that the Academic<br />\nCouncil and Owen as its head bit off more than they could<br />\nchew by resolving, however tacitly, to upgrade intersession,<br />\nthe faculty as a whole cannot escape the implication that it<br />\nhas been put to a form of test and found wanting in<br />\nconsciousness.<br />\n<br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI must take exception to both<br />\nthe article and the accompanying<br />\neditorial that appeared in Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter concerning the work<br />\nof the SAC to ratify a new<br />\nconstitution. Seeded with bias,<br />\npresenting misconceptions and<br />\nplain untruths, the article did not<br />\npresent the situation fairly, or even<br />\nfactually.<br />\nD'Agostino and Hirsh's article<br />\nstated that \"most of the members<br />\nof the SAC had seen the proposals<br />\nreworked and modified to suit<br />\nthem.\" This is simply not true. A<br />\nvote taken at the end of the last<br />\nmeeting showed that a clear<br />\nmajority of those present wanted<br />\nto reopen discussion on a part of<br />\nthe constitution to clarify the role<br />\nof the executive committee of the<br />\nSAC with the SAC itself to study<br />\n<br />\nmongers want to take final<br />\nresponsibility for important<br />\nmatters away from the handful<br />\nwho sit on the SAC executive<br />\ncommittee, chaired by Alan Fink,<br />\nand put it in the hands of the more<br />\nthan fifty leaders of the student<br />\nactivities -- if anything, exactly the<br />\nopposite of any concentration of<br />\npower in any one person.<br />\nSo then, the ratification of the<br />\nnew SAC constitution is not being<br />\ndelayed by a handful of loud<br />\nmouthed, petty power mongers,<br />\nbut instead any delay is caused by<br />\na majority of the SAC who are<br />\nworking to make sure that the SAC<br />\nwill have a workable constitution<br />\nin the future that will provide an<br />\nequitable base for all of the student activities.<br />\nPaul Kettl<br />\n<br />\nthe coke of the body of the SkC<br />\na.C.K.WWAN<br />\n<br />\nnyakang.

He is quoted in the<br />\narticle, criticizing Ed Brokans for<br />\nwanting to' make sure \"that the<br />\nSAC has the final decision on every<br />\nSAC financial dealing that takes<br />\nplace.\" The wording of the article<br />\nmakes it appear as though Mr.<br />\nBrokans was the only one on the<br />\nSAC who wanted to make sure<br />\nthat those who spend the student<br />\nactivities money in the end have<br />\nfinal responsibIlity for it. This is<br />\ncertainly not true, especially in lieu<br />\nof the fact that the majority of the<br />\nSAC voted to open the matter for<br />\ndiscussion. Also, it is somewhat<br />\nincredible that Mr. Fink would<br />\nobject to the idea that the heads of<br />\nthe student activities should have<br />\nthe final control and responsibility<br />\nfor the money of the activities on<br />\ncampus. Stating that the SAC<br />\nwould have the primary<br />\nresponsibility for itself does not<br />\nseem to deviate greatly from an<br />\nalready generally accepted part of<br />\nthe constitution, or from common<br />\nsense.<br />\nThe most outrageous of Mr.<br />\nFink's characterizations is the<br />\npresentation of certain SAC<br />\nmembers as being intoxicated with<br />\n\"the desire for power.\"<br />\nCharacterizations such as these do<br />\nnothing to expedite SAC<br />\nprocedings, and indeed, one must<br />\nwonder about the man who<br />\nuttered them. Projection never<br />\nceases to be a fascinating<br />\nphenomenon. Fink and others in<br />\nthe article are constantly referred<br />\nto as \"proponents of a stronger<br />\nSAC,\" and yet accuse others of,<br />\nhaving \"an incredible groping for<br />\npower.\" The people who Fink<br />\ncharacterize as petty power<br />\n<br />\n\u2022N\u201e kVe.<br />\n\u201e,, by \u201emimmw<br />\n<br />\nme<br />\n<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\nsnobbish assumption I once held to<br />\n<br />\nthe effect that a policeman is very<br />\napt to be a bum. I remember how<br />\nstartled I was when a Hopkins<br />\nstudent told me a few years ago<br />\nthat he planned to go into police<br />\nwork, but I came to respect his<br />\ndecision. I have had dealings with<br />\nfine policemen, but we would have<br />\nmore of them if we didn't ask<br />\nthem to rish their lives for us while<br />\ninwardly despising them. Someone<br />\n(Goethe?) said that we have the<br />\ngovernment we deserve. Our police<br />\nare our creation and exactly what<br />\nwe deserve. While Marc's effectual<br />\naccusations are almost certainly<br />\njustified so far as they go, I really<br />\ndoubt that we shall get a much<br />\nbetter police force by condemning<br />\nit for the rising crime rate. As I<br />\nnow see it, we should encourage<br />\nour good policemen by giving them<br />\nthe respect, status, and salary they<br />\ndeserve.

For example,<br />\nannouncements were circulated<br />\nlast year stating that Dr. High<br />\nKenner would speak for the<br />\nWednesday Noon Series on the<br />\ntopic of \"Stick and Strings: Some<br />\nStructural Curiosities.\" Among his<br />\nacademic intimates and followers,<br />\ngreat speculation was aroused as to<br />\nwhat he would really speak about.<br />\nOpinions ranged from \"the<br />\narchitectural motifs in The Waste<br />\nLand,\" to \"the musical metaphor<br />\nthat underlies modern existence.\"<br />\nThe day of the lecture arrived and,<br />\namazing to behold, Dr. Kenner<br />\nspoke about -- well, about stick<br />\nand strings, ! He exhibited models<br />\nmade of those materials, and<br />\nexplained how to go about making<br />\nsuch models. They were<br />\n\"tensegrity structures,\" he<br />\nexplained, invented in 1950 by<br />\nBuckminster Fuller (four years<br />\nlater came his patent of the<br />\ngeodesic dome). Kenner describes<br />\nthem a \"a queer kind of spike<br />\nsphere that stands free in<br />\nspace....No stick comes anywhere<br />\nnear touching another stick. Really<br />\nthere's no sphere, no continuous<br />\nsurface? just a connectedness,<br />\nalternatedly wire and stick,<br />\nenclosing empty space and<br />\npenetrated moreover by empty<br />\nspaces....A bee might pass right<br />\nthrough, or a canary; not a<br />\npartridge,\" He threw one of the<br />\nmysterious structures out into the<br />\naudience, and among this gathering<br />\nof PhD's and assorted academians<br />\nit was tossed back and forth like a<br />\nfrisbee \u2022 at a rock concert -- sec\u201eond<br />\nchildhoods.(For more information<br />\nabout these structures, see Bucky<br />\nKenner's account of the<br />\n\"Dymaxion\" -- i.e., \"yielding<br />\nmaximum performance from<br />\navailable technology\" -- i.e.,<br />\n\"yielding maximum performance<br />\nfrom available technology\" -world of Buckminster Fuller.)<br />\n<br />\n\"Multi-faceted\" -- such was the<br />\nfellow poets.

Enter young Hugh<br />\nKenner -- \"I had nothing to lose\" -who, while working on his<br />\ndoctorate at Yale, in six weeks of<br />\nthe summer of 1949, managed to<br />\nwrite the first book about Pound's<br />\nwork, logically entitled The Poetry<br />\nof Ezra Pound, giving credit where<br />\ndue. \"Public reaction was mixed,<br />\nbecause 'the subject was not<br />\nrespectable,\" Kenner now recalls.<br />\nPound himself had this to say of<br />\nthe book: \"Get out yen shillelaghs,<br />\nboys' -- meaning that he hoped it<br />\nwould rousesliscussion.\"<br />\nAnd so began the Pound-Kenner<br />\naffair. But, do not be misled to<br />\nbelieve that Kenner is in any way<br />\njust \"the Pound man.\" As<br />\nmentioned before, he is<br />\nmulti-faceted.

There<br />\nfollows a selection of sayings,<br />\nwitticisms, and revelations<br />\ncollected from various writings and<br />\nlectures of Hugh Kenner. There is a<br />\ncertain danger in quoting out of<br />\ncontext: it shall be risked,<br />\nhowever, in hopes that one will be<br />\ninspired (provoked?) to find out<br />\nfirsthand just what that context<br />\nreally is. And so, consider Hugh<br />\nKenner...<br />\n<br />\nTensegrity structure<br />\n...on his occupation: \"I'm<br />\ndefinitely not 'making a living' by<br />\nteaching college students.

After 23 years of<br />\ncontinuous teaching at the<br />\nUniversity of California (Santa<br />\nBarbara), one might wonder why<br />\nKenner has come to Hopkins. This<br />\nis his explanation: \"With the<br />\npublication of The Pound Era in<br />\n1971, I had come to the end of a<br />\ntwenty year plan. And so, I looked<br />\nfor a whole new environment, to<br />\nbegin anew another twenty year<br />\nplan. And besides, I always do<br />\nwhat I want to do.\" Now that he's<br />\nhere, what does Dr. Kenner think<br />\nof Hopkins students?

Hopkins also fumbled<br />\nfour times, losing all four while<br />\nalso suffering a pair of<br />\ninterceptions.

Only 13<br />\nof Homewood's 27 academic departments saw fit to sponsor<br />\ncourses. Far worse, however, is the fact that only 19 of the<br />\n329 Homewood faculty members \u2014 an ignominious 5.7% \u2014<br />\nwere willing to offer courses.<br />\nLast year's decision by the Academic Council to retain the<br />\nintersession program in its standing grade-credit format<br />\nseemed to portend good things, since the mandate opposed<br />\nsome vehement desires to see the program abrogated. The<br />\nherdic vote was heralded by Arts and Sciences potentates as a<br />\nsure augury of a quality 1975 intersession. But somewhere<br />\nalong the way to the Registrar's office, something happened.<br />\nIf Dean George Owen is \"shocked,\" one can just imagine how<br />\nthe students feel.<br />\nThough the unavoidable inference is that the Academic<br />\nCouncil and Owen as its head bit off more than they could<br />\nchew by resolving, however tacitly, to upgrade intersession,<br />\nthe faculty as a whole cannot escape the implication that it<br />\nhas been put to a form of test and found wanting in<br />\nconsciousness.<br /><br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI must take exception to both<br />\nthe article and the accompanying<br />\neditorial that appeared in Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter concerning the work<br />\nof the SAC to ratify a new<br />\nconstitution. Seeded with bias,<br />\npresenting misconceptions and<br />\nplain untruths, the article did not<br />\npresent the situation fairly, or even<br />\nfactually.<br />\nD'Agostino and Hirsh's article<br />\nstated that \"most of the members<br />\nof the SAC had seen the proposals<br />\nreworked and modified to suit<br />\nthem.\" This is simply not true. A<br />\nvote taken at the end of the last<br />\nmeeting showed that a clear<br />\nmajority of those present wanted<br />\nto reopen discussion on a part of<br />\nthe constitution to clarify the role<br />\nof the executive committee of the<br />\nSAC with the SAC itself to study<br /><br />\nmongers want to take final<br />\nresponsibility for important<br />\nmatters away from the handful<br />\nwho sit on the SAC executive<br />\ncommittee, chaired by Alan Fink,<br />\nand put it in the hands of the more<br />\nthan fifty leaders of the student<br />\nactivities -- if anything, exactly the<br />\nopposite of any concentration of<br />\npower in any one person.<br />\nSo then, the ratification of the<br />\nnew SAC constitution is not being<br />\ndelayed by a handful of loud<br />\nmouthed, petty power mongers,<br />\nbut instead any delay is caused by<br />\na majority of the SAC who are<br />\nworking to make sure that the SAC<br />\nwill have a workable constitution<br />\nin the future that will provide an<br />\nequitable base for all of the student activities.<br />\nPaul Kettl<br /><br />\nthe coke of the body of the SkC<br />\na.C.K.WWAN<br /><br />\nnyakang.

He is quoted in the<br />\narticle, criticizing Ed Brokans for<br />\nwanting to' make sure \"that the<br />\nSAC has the final decision on every<br />\nSAC financial dealing that takes<br />\nplace.\" The wording of the article<br />\nmakes it appear as though Mr.<br />\nBrokans was the only one on the<br />\nSAC who wanted to make sure<br />\nthat those who spend the student<br />\nactivities money in the end have<br />\nfinal responsibIlity for it. This is<br />\ncertainly not true, especially in lieu<br />\nof the fact that the majority of the<br />\nSAC voted to open the matter for<br />\ndiscussion. Also, it is somewhat<br />\nincredible that Mr. Fink would<br />\nobject to the idea that the heads of<br />\nthe student activities should have<br />\nthe final control and responsibility<br />\nfor the money of the activities on<br />\ncampus. Stating that the SAC<br />\nwould have the primary<br />\nresponsibility for itself does not<br />\nseem to deviate greatly from an<br />\nalready generally accepted part of<br />\nthe constitution, or from common<br />\nsense.<br />\nThe most outrageous of Mr.<br />\nFink's characterizations is the<br />\npresentation of certain SAC<br />\nmembers as being intoxicated with<br />\n\"the desire for power.\"<br />\nCharacterizations such as these do<br />\nnothing to expedite SAC<br />\nprocedings, and indeed, one must<br />\nwonder about the man who<br />\nuttered them. Projection never<br />\nceases to be a fascinating<br />\nphenomenon. Fink and others in<br />\nthe article are constantly referred<br />\nto as \"proponents of a stronger<br />\nSAC,\" and yet accuse others of,<br />\nhaving \"an incredible groping for<br />\npower.\" The people who Fink<br />\ncharacterize as petty power<br /><br />\n\u2022N\u201e kVe.<br />\n\u201e,, by \u201emimmw<br /><br />\nme<br /><br />\nor<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nsnobbish assumption I once held to<br /><br />\nthe effect that a policeman is very<br />\napt to be a bum. I remember how<br />\nstartled I was when a Hopkins<br />\nstudent told me a few years ago<br />\nthat he planned to go into police<br />\nwork, but I came to respect his<br />\ndecision.

For example,<br />\nannouncements were circulated<br />\nlast year stating that Dr. High<br />\nKenner would speak for the<br />\nWednesday Noon Series on the<br />\ntopic of \"Stick and Strings: Some<br />\nStructural Curiosities.\" Among his<br />\nacademic intimates and followers,<br />\ngreat speculation was aroused as to<br />\nwhat he would really speak about.<br />\nOpinions ranged from \"the<br />\narchitectural motifs in The Waste<br />\nLand,\" to \"the musical metaphor<br />\nthat underlies modern existence.\"<br />\nThe day of the lecture arrived and,<br />\namazing to behold, Dr. Kenner<br />\nspoke about -- well, about stick<br />\nand strings, !

They were<br />\n\"tensegrity structures,\" he<br />\nexplained, invented in 1950 by<br />\nBuckminster Fuller (four years<br />\nlater came his patent of the<br />\ngeodesic dome). Kenner describes<br />\nthem a \"a queer kind of spike<br />\nsphere that stands free in<br />\nspace....No stick comes anywhere<br />\nnear touching another stick. Really<br />\nthere's no sphere, no continuous<br />\nsurface? just a connectedness,<br />\nalternatedly wire and stick,<br />\nenclosing empty space and<br />\npenetrated moreover by empty<br />\nspaces....A bee might pass right<br />\nthrough, or a canary; not a<br />\npartridge,\" He threw one of the<br />\nmysterious structures out into the<br />\naudience, and among this gathering<br />\nof PhD's and assorted academians<br />\nit was tossed back and forth like a<br />\nfrisbee \u2022 at a rock concert -- sec\u201eond<br />\nchildhoods.(For more information<br />\nabout these structures, see Bucky<br />\nKenner's account of the<br />\n\"Dymaxion\" -- i.e., \"yielding<br />\nmaximum performance from<br />\navailable technology\" -- i.e.,<br />\n\"yielding maximum performance<br />\nfrom available technology\" -world of Buckminster Fuller.)<br /><br />\n\"Multi-faceted\" -- such was the<br />\nfellow poets.

Enter young Hugh<br />\nKenner -- \"I had nothing to lose\" -who, while working on his<br />\ndoctorate at Yale, in six weeks of<br />\nthe summer of 1949, managed to<br />\nwrite the first book about Pound's<br />\nwork, logically entitled The Poetry<br />\nof Ezra Pound, giving credit where<br />\ndue. \"Public reaction was mixed,<br />\nbecause 'the subject was not<br />\nrespectable,\" Kenner now recalls.<br />\nPound himself had this to say of<br />\nthe book: \"Get out yen shillelaghs,<br />\nboys' -- meaning that he hoped it<br />\nwould rousesliscussion.\"<br />\nAnd so began the Pound-Kenner<br />\naffair. But, do not be misled to<br />\nbelieve that Kenner is in any way<br />\njust \"the Pound man.\" As<br />\nmentioned before, he is<br />\nmulti-faceted. As evidence,<br />\nconsider these other works:<br />\nWyndham Lewis; Dublin's Joyce;<br />\nGnomon: Essays in Contemporary<br />\nLiterature; The Invisible Poet: T<br />\nS. Eliot;Samuel Beckett; The Stoic<br />\nComedians; The Counterfeiters;<br />\nBucky: A\" Guided Tour of<br />\nBuckminster Fuller; and numerous<br />\narticles, by no means restricted to<br />\nthe realm of literary criticism. For<br />\nexample, perhaps you were so<br />\nfortunate as to enjoy in the<br />\nOctober 27,1974 New York Times<br />\nMagazine Kenner's feature article<br />\nabout Alex Comfort, author of<br />\nThe Joy of Sex the article was<br /><br />\nbook<br /><br />\nwhose<br /><br />\nvariety<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nthemes<br /><br />\ngloriously confounds the Dewey<br />\nDecimal System( an achievement<br />\nthat Kenner obviously delights in):<br /><br />\n\"the Enlightenment', Buster<br />\nKeaton (stoic comedian): bad<br />\npoetry Albrecht Durer; Joyce?<br />\nSwift?

Eclectic,<br />\neccentric, entertaining, and<br />\ninformative: and, somehow the<br />\nwhole thing manages to stay<br />\ntogether, like the author, like a<br />\nFullerian tensegrity sphere, held<br />\ntogether by invisible connections,<br />\nthe resulting whole greater than<br />\nthe sum of the parts.<br />\nLet us now briefIS, yield the<br />\nfloor to Dr. Kenner himself. There<br />\nfollows a selection of sayings,<br />\nwitticisms, and revelations<br />\ncollected from various writings and<br />\nlectures of Hugh Kenner. There is a<br />\ncertain danger in quoting out of<br />\ncontext: it shall be risked,<br />\nhowever, in hopes that one will be<br />\ninspired (provoked?) to find out<br />\nfirsthand just what that context<br />\nreally is. And so, consider Hugh<br />\nKenner...<br /><br />\nTensegrity structure<br />\n...on his occupation: \"I'm<br />\ndefinitely not 'making a living' by<br />\nteaching college students. There<br />\nare much easier ways of making a<br />\nlivng than this!\"<br />\n...on ancient civilization: \"Let's<br />\nface it, the Romans were a culture<br />\nof hicks .\"<br />\n...on the nature of metaphor:<br />\n\"If 'my love is like a red, red, rose'<br />\nis nothing more than a pleasant<br />\nequation, then why not my love<br />\nis like a six-pack of Budweise-r?.\"<br />\n....on our very own language:<br />\n\"English is a sort of universal<br />\nlanguage museum, and if you pick<br />\nyour way carefully among the<br />\nexhibits, you can reconstruct<br />\nvirtually anything.\"<br />\n...on great moments in music:<br />\n\"In the very early nineteenth<br />\ncentury, the piano (the jukebox of<br />\nRomanticism), was invented by<br />\nsome enemy of humanity.\"<br />\n...on the apparant brilliance of<br />\nhis students: \"Lord, do I have to<br />\nsee to a lot of your education!\"<br />\nOr, 'Cultural amnesia never ceases<br />\nto amaze me.\"<br />\n...on the sages of the academic<br />\nworld: \"There are certain areas in<br />\nwhich there is no boob like a<br />\nprofessional classical scholar.\"<br />\n...on an adjective often evoked<br />\nbut rarely defined: \"Irrelevant -What I don't want to think about<br />\njust now.\" (Kennerian-Fullerian<br />\ndefinition from the Glossary of<br />\nBucky.)<br />\n...on \"those eminent writers of<br />\nfiction, Charles Dickens and<br />\nCharles Darwin\"('nuff said).<br />\n...on \"Phosphorescent<br />\nquotation:\" \"It was long supposed<br />\nthat a politician was best mocked<br />\nby parody: by isolating traits and<br />\nexaggerating them.

Of that Dr.<br />\nKenner is well aware. Against all<br />\nnatural order of God and man<br /><br />\nthough it may be, learning actually<br />\nbecomes an enjoyable experience<br />\nunder Dr. Kenner. If you are a<br />\nstudent, than you stand to gain<br />\nfrom this heresy, for, by some<br />\nquirk of fate, Hugh Kenner is here<br />\nat Hopkins. After 23 years of<br />\ncontinuous teaching at the<br />\nUniversity of California (Santa<br />\nBarbara), one might wonder why<br />\nKenner has come to Hopkins. This<br />\nis his explanation: \"With the<br />\npublication of The Pound Era in<br />\n1971, I had come to the end of a<br />\ntwenty year plan. And so, I looked<br />\nfor a whole new environment, to<br />\nbegin anew another twenty year<br />\nplan. And besides, I always do<br />\nwhat I want to do.\" Now that he's<br />\nhere, what does Dr. Kenner think<br />\nof Hopkins students? As opposed<br />\nto U. of Cal. students, he says,<br />\n\"Hopkins students are far more<br />\nmotivated. I don't have to sell the<br />\nsubject.

The hosts fumbled<br />\nfour times, but managed to<br />\nregain possession each time<br />\nthough they did yield three<br />\ninterceptions.<br />\nThe first quarter was one<br />\nwhich everyone associated with<br />\nHopkins football would like to<br />\nforget.<br />\nThe Blue Jays lost three<br />\nfumbles in the first quarter and<br />\nWestern Maryland turned two of<br />\nthem into touchdowns while also<br />\nconverting an interceptions into a<br />\nTD.<br />\nJay Rodstein (who started and<br />\nwas to be the first of three Green<br />\nTerror quarterbacks) passed<br />\n7-yards to Rick Rosenfeld for the<br />\nfirst Terrors score.<br />\nRosenfeld is a speedy<br /><br />\nNEWs4Enut<br />\nsports<br />\ndefensive back who specializes in<br />\npunt and kickoff returns but is<br />\ninserted at offensive back when<br />\nthe Westerners near their<br />\nopponents goal line.
