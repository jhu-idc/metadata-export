Anyone who attends weekly Council meetings would not be surprised by this.<br />\nThese meetings generally run smoothly and<br />\none may sense a complacent attitude. Indeed, members rarely vote against a motion.<br />\nThey are usually passed unanimously with<br />\nan occasional abstention.<br />\nThis is not to say that Council has been<br />\nineffective this year. It would be more correct to argue the reverse. Student Council has<br />\nbeen working toward bridging the corrununciation gaps at Hopkins and members seem<br />\ndedicated to improving student life here.<br />\nThis past Wednesday night was unusual,<br />\nhowever. Early in the meeting, the standard<br />\nCouncil proceedings took place. President<br />\nJon Lana expressed his weekly concern that<br />\nthe Council office hours be kept. The committees reported their activities. It seemed<br />\nanother traditional Council meeting.<br />\nThen something different happened. Jon<br />\nLana presented a resolution concerning the<br />\ncommitment of the administration to future<br />\nstudent involvement in WJHU-FM, the<br />\nformerly student-run radio station at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe fact that a resolution was offered is<br />\nnot surprising; Council commonly issues<br />\ngeneral resoluions involving timely student<br />\n<br />\nconcerns. Nor was the content of the resolution surprising; the proposal was composed<br />\nto communicate to the administration in a<br />\nnon-provoking manner that students expect<br />\na follow-up on the alleged commitment to<br />\nstudent involvement at the station. The<br />\nCouncil is a pragmatic organization; they<br />\nfully realize that they must be civil to the administration to get anything done.<br />\nWhat was surprising was the Council's<br />\nresponse. Based on the discussion, it seemed several members were offended by the<br />\ntone of the resolution: \"The Student Council...strongly and wholeheartedly supports<br />\nthe...commitment of the administration to<br />\ncontinued student involvement in WJHU...\"<br />\nRepresentatives felt this was not a true<br />\ndescription of students' feelings. Students<br />\nwere angry about the way the administration<br />\nhandled the radio station transition. If a<br />\nresolution was to be offered, they claimed,<br />\nit should outline specific student involvement<br />\nobjectives rather than giving the University<br />\na \"blank check\" in the interpretation of the<br />\nterm \"student involvement.\"<br />\nWe agree. Student involvement at WJHU<br />\nis too important an issue to be relegated to<br />\na resolution without real substance. Yet, the.<br />\nCouncil's rejection of this resolution is not<br />\nenough; a new proposal should be written<br />\nand approved which is more specific to the<br />\nproblem.<br />\n<br />\n_Opinion<br />\n<br />\nA Hopkins Bedtime SU:key<br />\nby Douglas Gordimer<br />\nThere once was a little boy<br />\nnamed Joshua, who had 10<br />\nmatchbox cars. He and his<br />\nfriends used to play with them<br />\nall the time in Joshua's room,<br />\nwhich was in the basement of<br />\nhis very large house. After a<br />\nwhile, Joshua and his friends<br />\nstarted getting very bored with<br />\nthe 10 matchbox cars. So one<br />\nday when Joshua's Uncle Steve<br />\ncame over to visit, he expressed his boredom. Uncle Steve<br />\nasked Joshua, \"How would<br />\nyou like 25,000 matchbox<br />\ncars?\"Joshua's eyes widened.<br />\nIt was like a dream come true!<br />\nUncle Steve said that in order<br />\nto have 25,000 matchbox cars,<br />\nJoshua would have to move to<br />\na new room, because his old<br />\none wasn't going to be big<br />\nenough to handle all those cars.<br />\nJoshua's parents were<br />\nalready having construction<br />\ndone on the house so they<br />\ndecided to give Joshua a brand<br />\nnew room, which could hold<br />\n25,000 matchbox cars and give<br />\nhim and his playmates room.<br />\nWhile this was being done,<br />\nJoshua had no place to stay.<br />\n<br />\nUncle Steve said that Aunt<br />\nBeatrice would be more than<br />\nwilling to take him. Poor Aunt<br />\nBea suffered from a form of<br />\nmotion sickness and therefore<br />\nJoshua would have to leave his<br />\n20 cars behind. Since Joshua<br />\nwas anticipating that soon he<br />\nwould have 25,000 cars, he<br />\nreluctantly consented.<br />\nUncle Steve promised Joshua<br />\nthat his room would be ready in<br />\na couple of days. So Joshua<br />\nwaited. And waited. And<br />\nplayed with imaginary cars.<br />\nAnd waited. He finally asked<br />\nAunt Bea to ask Uncle Steve<br />\nabout his room and his cars.<br />\nUncle Steve, who had been<br />\naway for a while, told Joshua<br />\nthat the architects were still<br />\nworking on the plans, and that<br />\nit would take a few more days.<br />\nHe also told Joshua that the<br />\nroom would be so large and<br />\nhave so many matchbox car<br />\nroads that he hired a traffic<br />\nmanager to watch over the cars<br />\nand Joshua and his friends to<br />\nmake sure everything ran<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nUncle Steve promised Joshua<br />\nthat he and his friends would<br />\nstill be able to play with the<br />\n<br />\nmatchbox cars, but that the<br />\ntraffic manager would prevent<br />\naccidents and other things.<br />\nSo Joshua, a little disheartened, waited. And waited. And<br />\nstarted thinking of other things<br />\nto play with. And waited.<br />\nFinally Uncle Steve called and<br />\ntold Joshua he had great news.<br />\nHe and the architects and<br />\nJoshua's parents had finally<br />\nfinished the plans. Uncle Steve<br />\nsaid they'd be using all the<br />\nlatest technology, including<br />\n\"automated matchbox car<br />\ntracks, with working traffic<br />\nlights and everything\". Uncle<br />\nSteve was excited that he would<br />\nhave such a show piece.<br />\nJoshua, now visibly upset<br />\nbecause all he wanted to do was<br />\nplay with his matchbox cars<br />\nwith his friends like he used to,<br />\ntold Uncle Steve that he was going to ride his Big Wheel<br />\naround the yard for a while.<br />\nUncle Steve told Joshua, \"I'm<br />\nsorry you can't ride your Big<br />\nWheel around the yard now,<br />\nbecause we're having a big party and you're not big enough to<br />\nattend.\"<br />\nJoshua took his Big Wheel<br />\nand rode away . . .<br />\n<br />\nSocial Relevance<br />\n<br />\nNo Stroking<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nOf all the sickeningly-cutesy<br />\nteam nicknames with which you<br />\nhave sullied the pages of the<br />\nNews-Letter's sports section,<br />\nthe worst to date is \"strokers,\"<br />\nmeant, I suppose, to refer to<br />\nmember of the rowing team.<br />\nWe are not \"strokers;\" the<br />\nword has connotations and<br />\novertones that are completely<br />\nunconnected with rowing, are<br />\noffensive, and are demeaning.<br />\nWhile the other teams here may<br />\nDavid Shapiro<br />\nbe happy with the epithets with<br />\nHopkins' Window<br />\nwhich you have tarred them,<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nthe crew is most assuredly not;<br />\nSo it's 1984 at Hopkins?

Union<br />\norganizers see and hear it<br />\namong young tradesmen. It<br />\neven surfaces in punk rock<br />\nmusic, in songs such as the<br />\nDead Kennedys' \"Kill the<br />\nPoor.\"<br />\nThere's a temptation to<br />\ndownplay this hostility as<br />\nmisguided innocence.

In each of<br />\nthe last three years, the ABC<br />\nNews/Washington Post poll<br />\nhas asked citizens whether the<br />\nfederal government should<br />\nreduce social programs in order<br />\nto trim the deficit. Each year,<br />\na larger percentage of<br />\nAmericans under 30 has advocated cutting those programs<br />\nto achieve that goal.<br />\nA Gallup Poll in 1983 found<br />\nthat 40 percent of all Americans<br />\nunder 30 favored further cuts in<br />\ngovernment social programs to<br />\nreduce the federal deficit; for<br />\nAmericans over 30, the share<br />\nwas only three points higher.<br />\nSimilar<br />\npolls<br />\nby<br />\nthe<br />\nYankelovich and Roper<br />\norganizations suggest more and<br />\nmore young Americans want<br />\nsocial programs returned to<br />\nstate governments or volunteer<br />\norganizatins.<br />\nThe hostile undercurrents are<br />\na symptom of economic insecurity.

We may all<br />\nlove to talk, but how often do<br />\nwe listen? By setting the play in<br />\na restaurant, Howe can focus<br />\non a variety of characters, from<br />\nthe couple who own the<br />\nrestaurant, to each particular<br />\ndiner. America is seated at each<br />\nof the different tables, and she<br />\nis so problem-ridden it's funny.<br />\nHowe does give us hope at<br />\nthe end when the diners all congregate around an offering<br />\nfrom the kitchen.

Howe's manipulation of<br />\ndialogue and interaction between characters is novel and<br />\napproaches (that nebulous<br />\nterm)real life in a way that few<br />\nothers have done in the past.<br />\nThough meant to be played,<br />\nnot read exclusively, Museum is<br />\na fine example of the wit and<br />\nliterary preciseness Howe puts<br />\ninto her work. A humorous expose of modern art and its affectations, Museum is as much<br />\na delight to read as it would be<br />\nto see upon the stage. Howe<br />\nmakes fun of our human<br />\npeculiarities through her satire<br />\non the world and precepts surrounding modern art. Museum<br />\nis her argument for sanity and<br />\na move away from the pedantism that permeates the art<br />\nworld, and indeed the whole of<br />\nsociety. In the end it is a<br />\nmedium through which we can<br />\nlaugh at ourselves without feel<br />\ning too guilty.<br />\nThe Art ofDining, as well, is<br />\nanother comment on modern<br />\nlife.

He will go on<br />\ntwo of three HUT missions<br />\nwhich are scheduled to begin in<br />\n1986.<br />\nAt this time, Hopkins is very<br />\nactive in astrophysics; both the<br />\nSpace Telescope and the HUT<br />\nare to begin operation in the<br />\nnear future. Unlike the Space<br />\nTelescope, however, the HUT<br />\nwill not be permanently stationed in space. Rather, it will re;main aboard the Shuttle and<br />\n'return to earth after each mission. This will allow the scientists greater flexibility to<br />\nmodify the telescope.<br />\nThe HUT will be launched<br />\nwith two other instruments<br />\nwhich were designed to explore<br />\nspace by looking at the<br />\nultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These<br />\ntwo instruments are an imaging<br />\ntelescope and a polarimeter.<br />\nThe three missions scheduled to<br />\ncarry these instruments are collectively called the Astro<br />\nmissions.<br />\nBesides Durrance, two other<br />\nscientists have been chosen to<br />\nfly on the Astro missions:<br />\n-Kenneth H. Nordsieck, an expert on polarimetry, who is an<br />\nassociate<br />\nprofessor<br />\nat<br />\nWashburn Observatory of the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin at<br />\nMadison.<br />\n-Ronald A. Parise of the Computer Science Corporation in<br />\nSilver Spring, Maryland, who<br />\nhas research interests in the properties of binary star systems.<br />\nParise works at the Goddard<br />\nSpace Flight Center in<br />\nGreenbelt.<br />\nTwo of the three scientists<br />\nwill be aboard each Astro mission. While in space, the instruments will operate 24 hours<br />\na day for eight days. The scientists will work in 12-hour shifts.<br />\nA single astronomer will be able<br />\nto operate all three instruments<br />\nand collect the data generated<br />\nby each.<br />\nThe data from these instruments will be sent directly<br />\nto earth by a Tracking and Data<br />\nRelay Satellite (TDRS) during<br />\nabout 60% to 70% of operation. When TDRS is not<br />\navailable, data will be stored on<br />\nthe shuttle for later transmission. This direct link, to ground<br />\nbased scientists, will permit<br />\nongoing analysis of the data<br />\nand thereby allow the schedule<br />\nto be modified in order to get<br />\nmore information about<br />\nunusual or<br />\nunexpected<br />\nphenomena.<br />\nThe shuttle will orbit the<br />\nearth every 90 minutes. Because<br />\nof this, the scientists plan their<br />\nobservations in 30 minute intervals. For 30 minutes they will<br />\nlook at an object on the \"day\"<br />\nside of the earth. For another<br />\n<br />\n30 minutes they will look at an<br />\nobject on the \"night\" side of<br />\nthe earth. The remaining orbit<br />\ntime will be used in between<br />\nobservations to set up and<br />\nfocus the instruments on their<br />\nnew target.<br />\nThe instruments will be<br />\nmounted on a pallet in the<br />\ncargo bay of the shuttle and<br />\nalthough the Astro missions are<br />\na Spacelab project, no Spacelab<br />\nmodule will be carried in the<br />\ncargo bay. This means that the<br />\ntelescopes must be operated<br />\nfrom the aft flight deck in the<br />\nfront of the shuttle.<br />\nIn order to operate the instruments effectively, three<br />\npeople must always be working<br />\naboard the shuttle. The first, a<br />\npilot, is needed to adjust the<br />\nposition of the shuttle itself.<br />\nThe second person, a mission<br />\nspecialist, must align the pallet<br />\non which the instruments are<br />\nmounted. Finally, one of the<br />\nscientists aboard, such as Durrance, must collect data from<br />\nthe three telescopes.<br />\nThe first Astro mission is<br />\nscheduled for March 6, 1986.<br />\nThe emphasis of this mission<br />\nwill be the observation of<br />\nHalley's Comet. The shuttle<br />\nflight coincides with the comet's closest approach to the sun.<br />\nWhile the shuttle is in orbit,<br />\nprobes from Japan, the Soviet<br />\nUnion and the European Space<br />\nAgency will also make observations of the comet.

Hoage is the Special<br />\nAssistant to the Director of the<br />\nNational Zoo in Washington,<br />\nD.C.<br />\nWebster's dictionary defines<br />\nextinction as \"no longer existing in living form.\" According to Hoage, extinction is a<br />\nnatural process which has occurred slowly, but quite fre-<br />\n<br />\nquently, throughout the earth's<br />\nhistory. According to the<br />\nfamous paleontologist Alfred<br />\nRomer,\"Survival is the exception, and extinction is the<br />\nrule.\" Moreover, extinction<br />\npermits the rise of new groups<br />\nof animals, so it is actually important that extinctions have<br />\noccurred in evolutionary<br />\nhistory, or new forms would<br />\nnever have appeared.<br />\nPaleontologists estimate that<br />\n98% of all plants and animals<br />\nthat have ever lived are now extinct, and only 2% continue to<br />\nevolve on earth today.<br />\nWhen speaking of something<br />\n\"going extinct,\" one must<br />\n<br />\nHenry Holt & Co<br />\n<br />\nA 16511 Illustration of the Dodo, which became extinct around 1693.<br />\n<br />\nspecify the level of biological<br />\ndiversity which has actually<br />\ndied out. If a particular species<br />\nor subspecies dies out, there<br />\nmay still be living members of<br />\nthat organism's genus, family,<br />\norder, and so forth. Conversely, if a certain order becomes<br />\nextinct, this implies that every<br />\ndivision beneath it (family,<br />\ngenus, species) has died out as<br />\nwell, and the effect is much<br />\nmore devastating.<br />\nFor example, the subspecies<br />\nof Mexican grizzly bear is<br />\nrapidly dying out. The level of<br />\nsubspecies corresponds to race<br />\nin humans. Therefore, whereas<br />\nthe species of grizzly bears is<br />\nthriving in areas such as Alaska<br />\nand Canada, the \"geographic<br />\nrace,\" or subspecies of Mexican<br />\ngrizzly bear is rapidly dying<br />\nout<br />\nIn the case of the Carolina<br />\nParakeet, which was the only<br />\nparrot-like bird native to North<br />\nAmerica, both the genus and<br />\nthe species were hunted to extinction early in this century.<br />\nThe Dodo bird, which was<br />\nkilled off by early explorers,<br />\nmainly on the island of<br />\nMauritius, was actually three<br />\ndifferent types of birds belonging to an entire family. The<br />\nlevel of biological diversity,<br />\ntherefore, is much greater in<br />\nthis case than it is for the Mexican grizzly or the Carolina<br />\nparakeet.<br />\nLarge-scale extinctions have<br />\noccurred many times in the<br />\ngeographic history of the earth.<br />\n<br />\nThe best known, perhaps, is the<br />\ndinosaur extinction at the end<br />\nof the Cretaceous period, about<br />\n65 million years ago, in which<br />\nall orders of dinosaur died out.<br />\nA much larger period of extinction, called the Great Dying, occurred about 225 million<br />\nyears ago during the Permean<br />\nperiod. It was caused by continental drift; as the continents<br />\nmoved closer together, the<br />\nhabitats of the shallow continental shelf seas which existed<br />\nbetween them were destroyed.<br />\nApproximately 90% of all<br />\nmarine invertebrates (50% of<br />\nthe reptiles and 50% of the amphibians) disappeared at this<br />\ntime. Thus, numbers of species<br />\ndying out in this period were<br />\nmuch greater than during the<br />\nextinction of the dinosaurs,<br />\nmillions of years later.<br />\nOnce the dinosaurs had died<br />\nout, whether from cold, heat,<br />\nor predatory animals (nobody<br />\nknows for sure) the mammals<br />\nwere finally able to evolve and<br />\nproliferate, since a major<br />\nsource of competition had been<br />\neliminated. Over a period of<br />\nabout 30 million years, the<br />\nmammals populated every conceivable niche, and grew to<br />\ngreat sizes (e.g. the mammoths). Man developed at the<br />\nend of the age of Giant Mammals, about 4 million years ago.<br />\nAlthough it is incorrect to say<br />\nthat man caused the extinction<br />\nof many of these giant mammals, including the mastodon,<br />\ngiant sloth and the mammoth,<br />\n<br />\nhe certainly sped up the process. The discovery of fire<br />\n500,000 years ago made it even<br />\neasier to hunt and kill animals<br />\nfor food.<br />\nAccording to Norman Meyer,<br />\nauthor of The Sinking Arc,<br />\nbefore this time, extinction occurred at a rate of 20 species per<br />\n1500 years. After 1650,<br />\nhowever, it averaged one<br />\nspecies every five years.

I would surely<br />\nhavi gone unnoticed (I had<br />\nchosen a seat in the back and<br />\nthe instructor was busy lecturing about every piece of equipment in the lab and their<br />\nvarious uses), had I not blurted<br />\nout during a lull on the \"importance of the Ehrlenmeyer<br />\nflask\"\u2014\"Nakedtron city.\" To<br />\nthis day I do not know why I<br />\nchose those particular words<br />\nwith which to make a complete<br />\nass of myself, but that was the<br />\nphrase that stumbled from my<br />\nsleep-numb lips. The shrieks of<br />\nlaughter from my classmates<br />\nwoke me up of course.<br />\n\"Nakedtron City?\" Ms.<br />\nMitch inquired. I glanced at her<br />\nseriously, taking in the full effect of her butch haircut and<br />\ncobbie-cuddlers.<br />\n\"Yes, Nakedtron City,\" I<br />\nrepeated loudly, my eyes open<br />\nthis time. \"It was a movie,<br />\nrated R, where they used the<br />\nEhrlenmeyer most obscenely.\"<br />\nPretty good, huh? But after<br />\ngraduation I promised never to<br />\nlet myself get into a situation<br />\nlike that ever again.

Two days later, after I<br />\nhad dashed off and had written<br />\nmost of this article, the right<br />\nhedge received similar treatment. Along with the bushes<br />\nwent the houses, office<br />\nbuildings, pubs, and football<br />\nstadia for a struggling, yet<br />\ngrowing, population of ambitious rats.

However, before I knew it<br />\nmy head was lolling back and<br />\nforth and I was scribbling the<br />\nCyrillic alphabet into my<br />\nnotebook. When I awoke the<br />\nclass and professor were silent.<br />\nDid he ask a question? Are they<br />\ntaking a surprise quiz? Were<br />\nthey talking about me? The last<br />\nthing I remembered hearing<br />\nwas the soft hypnotic tones of<br />\nthe professor's voice\u2014a dull<br />\nmonotone as predictable as a<br />\npendulum.

I sat in the first or<br />\nsecond row, drank coffee<br />\nbefore and sometimes during<br />\nthe class and even payed attention, but I would last maybe ten<br />\nminutes with my eyes wide<br />\nopen, after that they were twit:Fling with R.E.M.<br />\nStill, I never failed in determination; I volunteered to be a<br />\n:lass projectionist, certain that<br />\nthis exciting new responsibility<br />\nwould help me keep my eyes<br />\nopen (I was too squeamish for<br />\ntoothpicks). The moving pictures were no problem but I<br />\nfound out something about<br />\nmyself during the slide shows.<br />\nI can actually sleep standing<br />\nupright. This of course<br />\ndisrupted Dr. X's monologue;<br />\nI would usually respond after<br />\nthe third \"NEXT.\" (I also<br />\nfound that Dr. X could yell if<br />\nhe wanted to.)<br />\nI decided that afternoon<br />\nclasses, running over an hour,<br />\nwere just not for me.

I had acquired the<br />\nability to control my head and<br />\nneck while sleeping. I could also<br />\nhear certain portions of the lecture which interfered with my<br />\ndreams. However, don't think<br />\nProfessor Y was fooled. Time<br />\nseemed suspended when I<br />\nsnoozed and I could feel the<br />\nwhole class slipping by even if<br />\nI dozed half a minute.

War turned U2<br />\ninto a \"98-Rock band\"\u2014guitar<br />\nhero rock. So I was relieved to<br />\nhear Pride\u2014like most of War,<br />\ncommercial as hell but with the<br />\nemphasis on rhythm and<br />\nmelody instead of The Guitar.<br />\nStill, I was very surprised at<br />\nwhat I heard on \"The Unforgettable Fire.\" Throw all<br />\nthose guitar-rock labels out the<br />\nwindow, U2 is more atmospheric and quietly melodic<br />\nthan ever. Nor is this another<br />\npolitical album: only two songs<br />\ncome close to being protests:<br />\n<br />\n\"Pride\" and \"MLK\"(Martin<br />\nLuther King). Furthermore,<br />\nthis is not the overtly \"Christian\" album many were<br />\nexpecting\u2014that much is buried<br />\nin vague biblical allusions.<br />\nWhat this album is is a Brian<br />\nEno collaboration album. Eno<br />\nand his current work-mate,<br />\nDaniel Lanois, produced the<br />\nalbum and it shows. Eno, Mr.<br />\nAmbient himself, has returned<br />\nU2 to their rhythmic/atmospheric roots but unfortunately he may have overdone<br />\nit. The recording itself is very<br />\nbeautiful, but in making it so<br />\nEno has smoothed down the<br />\nrough edges that made U2 so<br />\nexciting. The album also suffers<br />\nfrom Eno's electronic overembellishments. He actually<br />\nmakes U2 sound like Electric<br />\nLight Orchestra on at least one<br />\noccasion (\"Indian Summer<br />\nSky\").<br />\nOther<br />\nEnomanifestations are: the song<br />\n\"4th of July,\" an instrumental<br />\n<br />\nthat could easily have been on<br />\nany of his \"ambient\" records;<br />\nand his occasional success in<br />\nturning the Edge into a Robert<br />\nFripp-like<br />\nexperimental<br />\nguitarist.<br />\nThis is not to say that this is<br />\nnot a U2 album. The Edge's<br />\ndistinctive guitar style is still<br />\nvery much in evidence and his<br />\ntrademark backing vocals still<br />\npop up occasionally; Bono is<br />\nstill one of the most affecting<br />\nvocalists in the business,<br />\nwhether slipping into a falsetto<br />\nor in a full yell; and Larry<br />\nMullen and Adam Clayton still<br />\nremain a more-than-solid<br />\nrhythmic section. There are<br />\nsome major changes, though<br />\nsome of them are due as much<br />\nto Eno's production as to a<br />\nchange in band philosophy.<br />\nThere is a general move away<br />\nfrom exciting, dancy rock and<br />\ntowards mood and melody: a<br />\nmove away from the likes of \"I<br />\nWill Follow\" and \"Sunday<br />\n<br />\nBloody Sunday\" and towards<br />\nsongs like Boy's \"The Ocean\"<br />\nand War's \"40.\" This album's<br />\ntitle track and the song \"Elvis<br />\nPresley and America\" are<br />\namong the prettiest songs U2<br />\nhas ever recorded.<br />\nThere is also a marked increase in lyrical vagueness. You<br />\nget the mood of the songs quite<br />\nhandily but usually you really<br />\ndon't know what's going on.<br />\nElemental imagery abounds\u2014<br />\nthere are many references to<br />\nFire, Rain, Earth, Sky, etc.\u2014<br />\nfolky imagery that Eno's electronic production actually<br />\nworks against. This lyrical<br />\nvagueness, coupled with the<br />\ngeneral moodiness of the<br />\nmusic, makes for a beautiful atmospheric record but at the<br />\nsame time for an album<br />\ndistinctly lacking in any real<br />\nemotional directness\u2014a quality that was previously one of<br />\nU2's most winning.<br />\nThe Unforgettable Fire is not<br />\n<br />\nas much a departure for U2 as<br />\nan inevitability. The band that<br />\nstarted out on Boy as a rock<br />\nband desperately wanting to<br />\ngrow up has matured (with the<br />\nhelp of the Eno/Lanois production)into a refined atmospheric<br />\nband, and an atmospheric<br />\nalbum is usually better to go to<br />\nsleep to than party to. Still, the<br />\nalbum is not really as boring as<br />\nit may have appeared from this<br />\nreview. Bono, at his most impressive vocally on this album,<br />\ndoes a good job of keeping the<br />\nproceedings alive. There is also<br />\na driving dance tune, \"Wire,\"<br />\nand of course the single, \"Pride<br />\n(In the Name of Love),\" which<br />\nis probably one of their best<br />\nsongs ever. I still get the overwhelming feeling that U2 has<br />\ngrown up too soon, though.<br />\nHere's hoping for a nice big<br />\nregression (and a more sympathetic producer) for the next<br />\nalbum.<br />\n<br />\nArts Calendar<br />\n\u2022 THEATRE:<br />\nZorba: Anthony Quinn stars in<br />\nthe Broadway production of<br />\nthe play.

Fortunately, only<br />\nthree resulted in turnovers. In<br />\nadditon, Hopkins amassed over<br />\n100 yards in penalties.<br />\nDefensively, the Jays were<br />\nsuperb, limiting the Mules to<br />\nonly 173 total yards.<br />\nMuhlenberg came into the<br />\ngame as the leading passing<br />\nteam in the conference, but<br />\ncould amass only 71 yards<br />\nthrough the air. Safety Jim<br />\nCardwell, injured last week<br />\nagainst Ursinus, missed most of<br />\nthe game, but Bill Lansinger<br />\ncame in and did a fine job. Cornerback Ken Hirschman picked off a pass, giving him three<br />\ninerceptions for the year.<br />\nThe tone of the game was set<br />\nearly, as neither offense could<br />\nmove at all in the first quarter.<br />\nMuhlenberg had the best opportunity, recovering a<br />\nHopkins fumble and taking<br />\nover on the Blue Jay 40-yard<br />\nline on their second possession.<br />\nThe defense held, however, as<br />\nlinebacker Jon Byrd blitzed on<br />\nthird down and stripped Mule<br />\nquarterback Pete Broas of the<br />\nball. Tom Kalup pounced on<br />\nthe fumble for the home team.<br />\nThe Jays got all the points<br />\nthey needed early in the second<br />\nquarter. The offense took over<br />\nthe ball on its own 41 yard line,<br />\nand the runners went to work.<br />\nTen plays later, Campbell hit<br />\nNutter on the five, and the<br />\ntailback raced in twelve yards<br />\nfor the score. Steve Mitchell,<br />\nwho took over the kicking<br />\nchores this week, added the extra point. The regular Jay<br />\nkickers, Tom Loftus and Eli<br />\nKabillio, had been suspended<br />\nearlier in the week for missing<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe drive was one of the Blue<br />\nJays' most convincing of the<br />\nyear, as eight of the ten plays<br />\nwere on the ground and all but<br />\none gained yardage.

Anyone who attends weekly Council meetings would not be surprised by this.<br />\nThese meetings generally run smoothly and<br />\none may sense a complacent attitude. Indeed, members rarely vote against a motion.<br />\nThey are usually passed unanimously with<br />\nan occasional abstention.<br />\nThis is not to say that Council has been<br />\nineffective this year. It would be more correct to argue the reverse. Student Council has<br />\nbeen working toward bridging the corrununciation gaps at Hopkins and members seem<br />\ndedicated to improving student life here.<br />\nThis past Wednesday night was unusual,<br />\nhowever. Early in the meeting, the standard<br />\nCouncil proceedings took place. President<br />\nJon Lana expressed his weekly concern that<br />\nthe Council office hours be kept. The committees reported their activities. It seemed<br />\nanother traditional Council meeting.<br />\nThen something different happened. Jon<br />\nLana presented a resolution concerning the<br />\ncommitment of the administration to future<br />\nstudent involvement in WJHU-FM, the<br />\nformerly student-run radio station at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe fact that a resolution was offered is<br />\nnot surprising; Council commonly issues<br />\ngeneral resoluions involving timely student<br /><br />\nconcerns. Nor was the content of the resolution surprising; the proposal was composed<br />\nto communicate to the administration in a<br />\nnon-provoking manner that students expect<br />\na follow-up on the alleged commitment to<br />\nstudent involvement at the station. The<br />\nCouncil is a pragmatic organization; they<br />\nfully realize that they must be civil to the administration to get anything done.<br />\nWhat was surprising was the Council's<br />\nresponse. Based on the discussion, it seemed several members were offended by the<br />\ntone of the resolution: \"The Student Council...strongly and wholeheartedly supports<br />\nthe...commitment of the administration to<br />\ncontinued student involvement in WJHU...\"<br />\nRepresentatives felt this was not a true<br />\ndescription of students' feelings. Students<br />\nwere angry about the way the administration<br />\nhandled the radio station transition. If a<br />\nresolution was to be offered, they claimed,<br />\nit should outline specific student involvement<br />\nobjectives rather than giving the University<br />\na \"blank check\" in the interpretation of the<br />\nterm \"student involvement.\"<br />\nWe agree. Student involvement at WJHU<br />\nis too important an issue to be relegated to<br />\na resolution without real substance. Yet, the.<br />\nCouncil's rejection of this resolution is not<br />\nenough; a new proposal should be written<br />\nand approved which is more specific to the<br />\nproblem.<br /><br />\n_Opinion<br /><br />\nA Hopkins Bedtime SU:key<br />\nby Douglas Gordimer<br />\nThere once was a little boy<br />\nnamed Joshua, who had 10<br />\nmatchbox cars. He and his<br />\nfriends used to play with them<br />\nall the time in Joshua's room,<br />\nwhich was in the basement of<br />\nhis very large house. After a<br />\nwhile, Joshua and his friends<br />\nstarted getting very bored with<br />\nthe 10 matchbox cars. So one<br />\nday when Joshua's Uncle Steve<br />\ncame over to visit, he expressed his boredom. Uncle Steve<br />\nasked Joshua, \"How would<br />\nyou like 25,000 matchbox<br />\ncars?\"Joshua's eyes widened.<br />\nIt was like a dream come true!<br />\nUncle Steve said that in order<br />\nto have 25,000 matchbox cars,<br />\nJoshua would have to move to<br />\na new room, because his old<br />\none wasn't going to be big<br />\nenough to handle all those cars.<br />\nJoshua's parents were<br />\nalready having construction<br />\ndone on the house so they<br />\ndecided to give Joshua a brand<br />\nnew room, which could hold<br />\n25,000 matchbox cars and give<br />\nhim and his playmates room.<br />\nWhile this was being done,<br />\nJoshua had no place to stay.<br /><br />\nUncle Steve said that Aunt<br />\nBeatrice would be more than<br />\nwilling to take him. Poor Aunt<br />\nBea suffered from a form of<br />\nmotion sickness and therefore<br />\nJoshua would have to leave his<br />\n20 cars behind. Since Joshua<br />\nwas anticipating that soon he<br />\nwould have 25,000 cars, he<br />\nreluctantly consented.<br />\nUncle Steve promised Joshua<br />\nthat his room would be ready in<br />\na couple of days. So Joshua<br />\nwaited. And waited. And<br />\nplayed with imaginary cars.<br />\nAnd waited. He finally asked<br />\nAunt Bea to ask Uncle Steve<br />\nabout his room and his cars.<br />\nUncle Steve, who had been<br />\naway for a while, told Joshua<br />\nthat the architects were still<br />\nworking on the plans, and that<br />\nit would take a few more days.<br />\nHe also told Joshua that the<br />\nroom would be so large and<br />\nhave so many matchbox car<br />\nroads that he hired a traffic<br />\nmanager to watch over the cars<br />\nand Joshua and his friends to<br />\nmake sure everything ran<br />\nsmoothly.<br />\nUncle Steve promised Joshua<br />\nthat he and his friends would<br />\nstill be able to play with the<br /><br />\nmatchbox cars, but that the<br />\ntraffic manager would prevent<br />\naccidents and other things.<br />\nSo Joshua, a little disheartened, waited. And waited. And<br />\nstarted thinking of other things<br />\nto play with. And waited.<br />\nFinally Uncle Steve called and<br />\ntold Joshua he had great news.<br />\nHe and the architects and<br />\nJoshua's parents had finally<br />\nfinished the plans. Uncle Steve<br />\nsaid they'd be using all the<br />\nlatest technology, including<br />\n\"automated matchbox car<br />\ntracks, with working traffic<br />\nlights and everything\". Uncle<br />\nSteve was excited that he would<br />\nhave such a show piece.<br />\nJoshua, now visibly upset<br />\nbecause all he wanted to do was<br />\nplay with his matchbox cars<br />\nwith his friends like he used to,<br />\ntold Uncle Steve that he was going to ride his Big Wheel<br />\naround the yard for a while.<br />\nUncle Steve told Joshua, \"I'm<br />\nsorry you can't ride your Big<br />\nWheel around the yard now,<br />\nbecause we're having a big party and you're not big enough to<br />\nattend.\"<br />\nJoshua took his Big Wheel<br />\nand rode away . . .<br /><br />\nSocial Relevance<br /><br />\nNo Stroking<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nOf all the sickeningly-cutesy<br />\nteam nicknames with which you<br />\nhave sullied the pages of the<br />\nNews-Letter's sports section,<br />\nthe worst to date is \"strokers,\"<br />\nmeant, I suppose, to refer to<br />\nmember of the rowing team.<br />\nWe are not \"strokers;\" the<br />\nword has connotations and<br />\novertones that are completely<br />\nunconnected with rowing, are<br />\noffensive, and are demeaning.<br />\nWhile the other teams here may<br />\nDavid Shapiro<br />\nbe happy with the epithets with<br />\nHopkins' Window<br />\nwhich you have tarred them,<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nthe crew is most assuredly not;<br />\nSo it's 1984 at Hopkins?

We may all<br />\nlove to talk, but how often do<br />\nwe listen? By setting the play in<br />\na restaurant, Howe can focus<br />\non a variety of characters, from<br />\nthe couple who own the<br />\nrestaurant, to each particular<br />\ndiner. America is seated at each<br />\nof the different tables, and she<br />\nis so problem-ridden it's funny.<br />\nHowe does give us hope at<br />\nthe end when the diners all congregate around an offering<br />\nfrom the kitchen.

Howe's manipulation of<br />\ndialogue and interaction between characters is novel and<br />\napproaches (that nebulous<br />\nterm)real life in a way that few<br />\nothers have done in the past.<br />\nThough meant to be played,<br />\nnot read exclusively, Museum is<br />\na fine example of the wit and<br />\nliterary preciseness Howe puts<br />\ninto her work. A humorous expose of modern art and its affectations, Museum is as much<br />\na delight to read as it would be<br />\nto see upon the stage. Howe<br />\nmakes fun of our human<br />\npeculiarities through her satire<br />\non the world and precepts surrounding modern art. Museum<br />\nis her argument for sanity and<br />\na move away from the pedantism that permeates the art<br />\nworld, and indeed the whole of<br />\nsociety. In the end it is a<br />\nmedium through which we can<br />\nlaugh at ourselves without feel<br />\ning too guilty.<br />\nThe Art ofDining, as well, is<br />\nanother comment on modern<br />\nlife.

He will go on<br />\ntwo of three HUT missions<br />\nwhich are scheduled to begin in<br />\n1986.<br />\nAt this time, Hopkins is very<br />\nactive in astrophysics; both the<br />\nSpace Telescope and the HUT<br />\nare to begin operation in the<br />\nnear future. Unlike the Space<br />\nTelescope, however, the HUT<br />\nwill not be permanently stationed in space. Rather, it will re;main aboard the Shuttle and<br />\n'return to earth after each mission. This will allow the scientists greater flexibility to<br />\nmodify the telescope.<br />\nThe HUT will be launched<br />\nwith two other instruments<br />\nwhich were designed to explore<br />\nspace by looking at the<br />\nultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These<br />\ntwo instruments are an imaging<br />\ntelescope and a polarimeter.<br />\nThe three missions scheduled to<br />\ncarry these instruments are collectively called the Astro<br />\nmissions.<br />\nBesides Durrance, two other<br />\nscientists have been chosen to<br />\nfly on the Astro missions:<br />\n-Kenneth H. Nordsieck, an expert on polarimetry, who is an<br />\nassociate<br />\nprofessor<br />\nat<br />\nWashburn Observatory of the<br /><br />\nUniversity of Wisconsin at<br />\nMadison.<br />\n-Ronald A. Parise of the Computer Science Corporation in<br />\nSilver Spring, Maryland, who<br />\nhas research interests in the properties of binary star systems.<br />\nParise works at the Goddard<br />\nSpace Flight Center in<br />\nGreenbelt.<br />\nTwo of the three scientists<br />\nwill be aboard each Astro mission. While in space, the instruments will operate 24 hours<br />\na day for eight days. The scientists will work in 12-hour shifts.<br />\nA single astronomer will be able<br />\nto operate all three instruments<br />\nand collect the data generated<br />\nby each.<br />\nThe data from these instruments will be sent directly<br />\nto earth by a Tracking and Data<br />\nRelay Satellite (TDRS) during<br />\nabout 60% to 70% of operation. When TDRS is not<br />\navailable, data will be stored on<br />\nthe shuttle for later transmission. This direct link, to ground<br />\nbased scientists, will permit<br />\nongoing analysis of the data<br />\nand thereby allow the schedule<br />\nto be modified in order to get<br />\nmore information about<br />\nunusual or<br />\nunexpected<br />\nphenomena.<br />\nThe shuttle will orbit the<br />\nearth every 90 minutes. Because<br />\nof this, the scientists plan their<br />\nobservations in 30 minute intervals. For 30 minutes they will<br />\nlook at an object on the \"day\"<br />\nside of the earth. For another<br /><br />\n30 minutes they will look at an<br />\nobject on the \"night\" side of<br />\nthe earth. The remaining orbit<br />\ntime will be used in between<br />\nobservations to set up and<br />\nfocus the instruments on their<br />\nnew target.<br />\nThe instruments will be<br />\nmounted on a pallet in the<br />\ncargo bay of the shuttle and<br />\nalthough the Astro missions are<br />\na Spacelab project, no Spacelab<br />\nmodule will be carried in the<br />\ncargo bay. This means that the<br />\ntelescopes must be operated<br />\nfrom the aft flight deck in the<br />\nfront of the shuttle.<br />\nIn order to operate the instruments effectively, three<br />\npeople must always be working<br />\naboard the shuttle. The first, a<br />\npilot, is needed to adjust the<br />\nposition of the shuttle itself.<br />\nThe second person, a mission<br />\nspecialist, must align the pallet<br />\non which the instruments are<br />\nmounted. Finally, one of the<br />\nscientists aboard, such as Durrance, must collect data from<br />\nthe three telescopes.<br />\nThe first Astro mission is<br />\nscheduled for March 6, 1986.<br />\nThe emphasis of this mission<br />\nwill be the observation of<br />\nHalley's Comet. The shuttle<br />\nflight coincides with the comet's closest approach to the sun.<br />\nWhile the shuttle is in orbit,<br />\nprobes from Japan, the Soviet<br />\nUnion and the European Space<br />\nAgency will also make observations of the comet.

Hoage is the Special<br />\nAssistant to the Director of the<br />\nNational Zoo in Washington,<br />\nD.C.<br />\nWebster's dictionary defines<br />\nextinction as \"no longer existing in living form.\" According to Hoage, extinction is a<br />\nnatural process which has occurred slowly, but quite fre-<br /><br />\nquently, throughout the earth's<br />\nhistory. According to the<br />\nfamous paleontologist Alfred<br />\nRomer,\"Survival is the exception, and extinction is the<br />\nrule.\" Moreover, extinction<br />\npermits the rise of new groups<br />\nof animals, so it is actually important that extinctions have<br />\noccurred in evolutionary<br />\nhistory, or new forms would<br />\nnever have appeared.<br />\nPaleontologists estimate that<br />\n98% of all plants and animals<br />\nthat have ever lived are now extinct, and only 2% continue to<br />\nevolve on earth today.<br />\nWhen speaking of something<br />\n\"going extinct,\" one must<br /><br />\nHenry Holt &amp; Co<br /><br />\nA 16511 Illustration of the Dodo, which became extinct around 1693.<br /><br />\nspecify the level of biological<br />\ndiversity which has actually<br />\ndied out. If a particular species<br />\nor subspecies dies out, there<br />\nmay still be living members of<br />\nthat organism's genus, family,<br />\norder, and so forth. Conversely, if a certain order becomes<br />\nextinct, this implies that every<br />\ndivision beneath it (family,<br />\ngenus, species) has died out as<br />\nwell, and the effect is much<br />\nmore devastating.<br />\nFor example, the subspecies<br />\nof Mexican grizzly bear is<br />\nrapidly dying out. The level of<br />\nsubspecies corresponds to race<br />\nin humans. Therefore, whereas<br />\nthe species of grizzly bears is<br />\nthriving in areas such as Alaska<br />\nand Canada, the \"geographic<br />\nrace,\" or subspecies of Mexican<br />\ngrizzly bear is rapidly dying<br />\nout<br />\nIn the case of the Carolina<br />\nParakeet, which was the only<br />\nparrot-like bird native to North<br />\nAmerica, both the genus and<br />\nthe species were hunted to extinction early in this century.<br />\nThe Dodo bird, which was<br />\nkilled off by early explorers,<br />\nmainly on the island of<br />\nMauritius, was actually three<br />\ndifferent types of birds belonging to an entire family. The<br />\nlevel of biological diversity,<br />\ntherefore, is much greater in<br />\nthis case than it is for the Mexican grizzly or the Carolina<br />\nparakeet.<br />\nLarge-scale extinctions have<br />\noccurred many times in the<br />\ngeographic history of the earth.<br /><br />\nThe best known, perhaps, is the<br />\ndinosaur extinction at the end<br />\nof the Cretaceous period, about<br />\n65 million years ago, in which<br />\nall orders of dinosaur died out.<br />\nA much larger period of extinction, called the Great Dying, occurred about 225 million<br />\nyears ago during the Permean<br />\nperiod. It was caused by continental drift; as the continents<br />\nmoved closer together, the<br />\nhabitats of the shallow continental shelf seas which existed<br />\nbetween them were destroyed.<br />\nApproximately 90% of all<br />\nmarine invertebrates (50% of<br />\nthe reptiles and 50% of the amphibians) disappeared at this<br />\ntime. Thus, numbers of species<br />\ndying out in this period were<br />\nmuch greater than during the<br />\nextinction of the dinosaurs,<br />\nmillions of years later.<br />\nOnce the dinosaurs had died<br />\nout, whether from cold, heat,<br />\nor predatory animals (nobody<br />\nknows for sure) the mammals<br />\nwere finally able to evolve and<br />\nproliferate, since a major<br />\nsource of competition had been<br />\neliminated. Over a period of<br />\nabout 30 million years, the<br />\nmammals populated every conceivable niche, and grew to<br />\ngreat sizes (e.g. the mammoths). Man developed at the<br />\nend of the age of Giant Mammals, about 4 million years ago.<br />\nAlthough it is incorrect to say<br />\nthat man caused the extinction<br />\nof many of these giant mammals, including the mastodon,<br />\ngiant sloth and the mammoth,<br /><br />\nhe certainly sped up the process. The discovery of fire<br />\n500,000 years ago made it even<br />\neasier to hunt and kill animals<br />\nfor food.<br />\nAccording to Norman Meyer,<br />\nauthor of The Sinking Arc,<br />\nbefore this time, extinction occurred at a rate of 20 species per<br />\n1500 years. After 1650,<br />\nhowever, it averaged one<br />\nspecies every five years. The<br />\nStellar sea cow of the Bering<br />\nSea, and Galapagos tortoise<br />\nwere two creatures which disappeared at this time. Meyer<br />\nestimates that by 1850, one<br />\nspecies was becoming extinct<br />\nevery 9 months. The Labrador<br />\nduck, the passenger pigeon,<br />\nand the Eastern bison, a<br />\nsubspecies of the American<br />\nbison, all disappeared between<br />\n1850 and 1900. According to<br />\nMeyer, we are now losing one<br />\nspecies per hour. Comparing<br />\nthis to the extinction rate during the dinosaur period of one<br />\nspecies per 1000 years, it is apparent that extinction has increased dramatically, and that<br />\nthis increase is due to such factors as competition for space<br />\nand resources, and the rise of<br />\nman along with modern<br />\ntechnology.<br />\nScientists still don't know exactly why certain animals<br />\nbecome extinct, while others<br />\nsurvive. There are, however,<br />\nseveral factors which make a<br />\nspecies more vulnerable to exContinued on Page 12<br /><br />\n10/OCTOBER 19, 1984<br />\n0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nU<br /><br />\n00S<br />\n00<br /><br />\nDon't Miss the JSA's<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 GALA<br /><br />\nBAGEL<br />\nBRUNCH<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nSunday, October 21<br />\n11 am \u2022 12:30 pm<br />\nGreat Hall \u2022 Levering<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nWe ordered 50% more<br />\nfood this time!<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nThursday, October 25<br />\n000<br />\n0<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nin the<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nGreat Hall<br />\n7:30 pm<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\n00<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n00<br />\n0<br /><br />\n$1.50 Admission<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nE<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nRefreshments<br />\n0B served<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nCall 889-5452 for 0F31<br />\nmore information E,)<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n\u2022<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\nrA000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n.41111.

War turned U2<br />\ninto a \"98-Rock band\"\u2014guitar<br />\nhero rock. So I was relieved to<br />\nhear Pride\u2014like most of War,<br />\ncommercial as hell but with the<br />\nemphasis on rhythm and<br />\nmelody instead of The Guitar.<br />\nStill, I was very surprised at<br />\nwhat I heard on \"The Unforgettable Fire.\" Throw all<br />\nthose guitar-rock labels out the<br />\nwindow, U2 is more atmospheric and quietly melodic<br />\nthan ever. Nor is this another<br />\npolitical album: only two songs<br />\ncome close to being protests:<br /><br />\n\"Pride\" and \"MLK\"(Martin<br />\nLuther King). Furthermore,<br />\nthis is not the overtly \"Christian\" album many were<br />\nexpecting\u2014that much is buried<br />\nin vague biblical allusions.<br />\nWhat this album is is a Brian<br />\nEno collaboration album. Eno<br />\nand his current work-mate,<br />\nDaniel Lanois, produced the<br />\nalbum and it shows. Eno, Mr.<br />\nAmbient himself, has returned<br />\nU2 to their rhythmic/atmospheric roots but unfortunately he may have overdone<br />\nit. The recording itself is very<br />\nbeautiful, but in making it so<br />\nEno has smoothed down the<br />\nrough edges that made U2 so<br />\nexciting. The album also suffers<br />\nfrom Eno's electronic overembellishments. He actually<br />\nmakes U2 sound like Electric<br />\nLight Orchestra on at least one<br />\noccasion (\"Indian Summer<br />\nSky\").<br />\nOther<br />\nEnomanifestations are: the song<br />\n\"4th of July,\" an instrumental<br /><br />\nthat could easily have been on<br />\nany of his \"ambient\" records;<br />\nand his occasional success in<br />\nturning the Edge into a Robert<br />\nFripp-like<br />\nexperimental<br />\nguitarist.<br />\nThis is not to say that this is<br />\nnot a U2 album. The Edge's<br />\ndistinctive guitar style is still<br />\nvery much in evidence and his<br />\ntrademark backing vocals still<br />\npop up occasionally; Bono is<br />\nstill one of the most affecting<br />\nvocalists in the business,<br />\nwhether slipping into a falsetto<br />\nor in a full yell; and Larry<br />\nMullen and Adam Clayton still<br />\nremain a more-than-solid<br />\nrhythmic section. There are<br />\nsome major changes, though<br />\nsome of them are due as much<br />\nto Eno's production as to a<br />\nchange in band philosophy.<br />\nThere is a general move away<br />\nfrom exciting, dancy rock and<br />\ntowards mood and melody: a<br />\nmove away from the likes of \"I<br />\nWill Follow\" and \"Sunday<br /><br />\nBloody Sunday\" and towards<br />\nsongs like Boy's \"The Ocean\"<br />\nand War's \"40.\" This album's<br />\ntitle track and the song \"Elvis<br />\nPresley and America\" are<br />\namong the prettiest songs U2<br />\nhas ever recorded.<br />\nThere is also a marked increase in lyrical vagueness. You<br />\nget the mood of the songs quite<br />\nhandily but usually you really<br />\ndon't know what's going on.<br />\nElemental imagery abounds\u2014<br />\nthere are many references to<br />\nFire, Rain, Earth, Sky, etc.\u2014<br />\nfolky imagery that Eno's electronic production actually<br />\nworks against. This lyrical<br />\nvagueness, coupled with the<br />\ngeneral moodiness of the<br />\nmusic, makes for a beautiful atmospheric record but at the<br />\nsame time for an album<br />\ndistinctly lacking in any real<br />\nemotional directness\u2014a quality that was previously one of<br />\nU2's most winning.<br />\nThe Unforgettable Fire is not<br /><br />\nas much a departure for U2 as<br />\nan inevitability. The band that<br />\nstarted out on Boy as a rock<br />\nband desperately wanting to<br />\ngrow up has matured (with the<br />\nhelp of the Eno/Lanois production)into a refined atmospheric<br />\nband, and an atmospheric<br />\nalbum is usually better to go to<br />\nsleep to than party to. Still, the<br />\nalbum is not really as boring as<br />\nit may have appeared from this<br />\nreview. Bono, at his most impressive vocally on this album,<br />\ndoes a good job of keeping the<br />\nproceedings alive. There is also<br />\na driving dance tune, \"Wire,\"<br />\nand of course the single, \"Pride<br />\n(In the Name of Love),\" which<br />\nis probably one of their best<br />\nsongs ever. I still get the overwhelming feeling that U2 has<br />\ngrown up too soon, though.<br />\nHere's hoping for a nice big<br />\nregression (and a more sympathetic producer) for the next<br />\nalbum.<br /><br />\nArts Calendar<br />\n\u2022 THEATRE:<br />\nZorba: Anthony Quinn stars in<br />\nthe Broadway production of<br />\nthe play.

When Campbell was<br />\ncalled on to pass, he was on<br />\ntarget, completing six of his 13<br />\nthrows for 112 yards and two<br />\ntouchdowns.<br />\nPart of the effectiveness of<br />\nthe Jays' ground game may<br />\nhave been due to an offensive<br />\nformation that Head Coach<br /><br />\nJerry Pfeifer used extensively<br />\nfor the first time this season.<br />\nWide receiver Steve Mitchell<br />\nwas lined up next to the right<br />\ntackle as a second tight end,<br />\nwhile the wingback played wide<br />\non the right side and halfback<br />\n'Tony Nutter moved from the<br />\nbackfield to the left side.<br /><br />\nMcLam remained the lone<br />\nsetback.<br />\nAccording to Pfeifer, \"They<br />\ndidn't make any adjustments,<br />\nso we stuck with it.\" The set<br />\nworked, as the offensive<br />\nstatistics demonstrated.<br />\nOne problem that won't go<br />\naway, however, is the team's<br />\npropensity for foolish mistakes.<br />\nThe Jays fumbled the ball nine<br />\ntimes, bringing the season total<br />\nup to 29. Fortunately, only<br />\nthree resulted in turnovers. In<br />\nadditon, Hopkins amassed over<br />\n100 yards in penalties.<br />\nDefensively, the Jays were<br />\nsuperb, limiting the Mules to<br />\nonly 173 total yards.<br />\nMuhlenberg came into the<br />\ngame as the leading passing<br />\nteam in the conference, but<br />\ncould amass only 71 yards<br />\nthrough the air. Safety Jim<br />\nCardwell, injured last week<br />\nagainst Ursinus, missed most of<br />\nthe game, but Bill Lansinger<br />\ncame in and did a fine job. Cornerback Ken Hirschman picked off a pass, giving him three<br />\ninerceptions for the year.<br />\nThe tone of the game was set<br />\nearly, as neither offense could<br />\nmove at all in the first quarter.<br />\nMuhlenberg had the best opportunity, recovering a<br />\nHopkins fumble and taking<br />\nover on the Blue Jay 40-yard<br />\nline on their second possession.<br />\nThe defense held, however, as<br />\nlinebacker Jon Byrd blitzed on<br />\nthird down and stripped Mule<br />\nquarterback Pete Broas of the<br />\nball. Tom Kalup pounced on<br />\nthe fumble for the home team.<br />\nThe Jays got all the points<br />\nthey needed early in the second<br />\nquarter. The offense took over<br />\nthe ball on its own 41 yard line,<br />\nand the runners went to work.<br />\nTen plays later, Campbell hit<br />\nNutter on the five, and the<br />\ntailback raced in twelve yards<br />\nfor the score.

The regular Jay<br />\nkickers, Tom Loftus and Eli<br />\nKabillio, had been suspended<br />\nearlier in the week for missing<br />\npractice.<br />\nThe drive was one of the Blue<br />\nJays' most convincing of the<br />\nyear, as eight of the ten plays<br />\nwere on the ground and all but<br />\none gained yardage.

Ironically, the Blue Jays<br />\noutshot their opposition 18-17<br />\non the evening, but a lack of intensity in the second half and<br />\npoor shooting did them in.<br />\nThe Jays hope to get back on<br />\nthe winning track next week.<br />\nThey tackle Franklin and Marshall tomorrow on the road,<br />\nand visit Widener Wednesday,<br />\nbefore returning home to play<br />\na tough Washington College<br />\nteam on Friday, October 26.<br /><br />\nVolleyball Loses<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\nAlthough fairly easily<br />\ndefeated, the Jays touted some<br />\nfairly impressive statistics from<br />\na number of players.
