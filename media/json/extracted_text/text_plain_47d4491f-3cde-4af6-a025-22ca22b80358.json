Also, an activity will be<br />\ninformed when they reach 50%<br />\nto 25% of the allotted budget.<br />\n\"Some activities should realize<br />\nthey're overspending due to<br />\nnegligence,\" Tillem asserted.<br />\nAlthough the SAC does not<br />\nallow any organization to go<br />\nbeyond the allotted funds, the<br />\nSAC contingency fund can be<br />\nemployed to keep the<br />\norganization out of the red with<br />\nSAC approval.<br />\n\"In most cases the project will<br />\nhave to be a fairly worthwhile<br />\n<br />\none to get SAC approval,\" stated<br />\nTillem.<br />\nA deficit will be allowed, for<br />\nexample, when a club, such as<br />\nthe Barnstormers, anticipate a<br />\nrevenue from an upcoming<br />\nproject which will cover the<br />\nshort-term loss.<br />\nThe $7,200 being donated to<br />\nthe SAC will cover the deficits<br />\naccumulated last year.

With the<br />\nOrioles complaining about not<br />\nreaching the million mark in season<br />\nattendance and the N.F.L.<br />\nmoaning about its \"no-shows,\" it<br />\nonly seems appropriate to lament<br />\nHopkins attendance.<br />\nThe weatherman could not have<br />\nprovided a better day and those<br />\nwho attended Saturday's games<br />\nwere treated to exciting<br />\nperformances.

So what I basically did was<br />\ngive in to my ignorance and sat<br />\nback to watch the series of five<br />\none-act plays by the barnstormers,<br />\nentitled Turnips. Personally I had a<br />\nvery enjoyable time as both my<br />\ncompany and the plays were<br />\n<br />\n.a.`e.<br />\n<br />\ne.<br />\n<br />\ngood and even at times excellent.<br />\nFreshmen Talent<br />\nI was surprised to find that some<br />\nif not most of the acting in these<br />\nplays was accomplished by<br />\nfreshman. Special mention is given<br />\nto Diane Reese in her performance<br />\nin \"Hello Out There\" along with<br />\nJim Kennedy in the same<br />\nperformance. My favorite play was<br />\n<br />\n\"The Love Course\" in which Sally<br />\nFuller and Charles Henderson gave<br />\nwhat I considered the best<br />\nperformances of the evening.<br />\niRelax Awhile<br />\nIn so far as a pleasant relaxing<br />\nand fun evening goes on the<br />\nHopkins campus, Turnips is an<br />\nexcellent choice and it is free.<br />\n<br />\nThe Rally<br />\n<br />\nHD.

The<br />\nBarnstormers remain an artistic<br />\ngroup of Hopkins and Goucher<br />\nstudents in a community that is<br />\nbasically apathetic to that sort of<br />\nthing.

Duvoisin in a letter to the<br />\neditor Sept. 18, 1973.<br />\nLet me refute Mr. Duvoisin's<br />\nrash generalizations about Goucher<br />\ngirls by saying that each student<br />\nhas the right to be an individual in<br />\n<br />\nparticular mode. We are human<br />\nbeings, each with individual needs<br />\nand desires, so accept us as<br />\nindividuals!<br />\n<br />\nThe Pikesville National Guard<br />\nArmory was the scene of a<br />\ndemonstration of \"solidarity with<br />\n<br />\nthe people of Israel \"last Tuesdafr<br />\nnight. Over 8,000 persons turned<br />\nout to express their support of<br />\nIsrael and hear such Maryland<br />\nnotables as Governor Mandel,<br />\nSenators J. Glen Beall and Charles<br />\nMathias,<br />\nAfter the invocation by Rabbi<br />\nAbraham Shusterman, Dale<br />\nAnderson, Baltimore County<br />\nExecutive (currently under<br />\nindictment), led off with a tough<br />\nspeech and a plea for contributions<br />\nto the Israel Emergency Fund. Said<br />\nAnderson, \"If I had as much<br />\nmoney stashed away as the Federal<br />\nGovernment says I do I could<br />\nfinance the whole war.\"<br />\n.<br />\nAnderson was followed by<br />\nMathias and Beall whose speeches<br />\nwere several times interrupted by<br />\napplause.

Each year, 'the<br />\nB.I.A. holds interviews for anyone<br />\ninterested in applying to the<br />\nBoard. We definitly strive to obtain<br />\na balanced representation of all<br />\nfraternities and independents, but<br />\nour selections are limited to those<br />\nwho apply \u2014 in past years, the<br />\nmajority of the applicants have<br />\ncome from only two fraternities.<br />\nAs a general rule, anyone showing<br />\nan interest to work for the B.I.A.<br />\nfrom a fraternity not represented<br />\non the Board is accepted with no<br />\narguments. When the applicants<br />\ncome out of only two fraternities,<br />\nthe majority of the representatives<br />\nselected will be from those<br />\nfraternities. Mr. Brown's idea of<br />\nmanditory participation from all<br />\ncampus fraternities would result in<br />\npeople on the Board who _don't<br />\ncare about the B.I.A. and who<br />\nwould not be willing to put forth<br />\nthe time and effort required to<br />\norganize a given sport. These sports<br />\nwould probably end up being run<br />\nmuch less professionally and<br />\nefficiently.<br />\nApplicants are also selected on<br />\ntheir general knowledge and<br />\nbackground of all sports, and on<br />\nany great wealth of knowledge of<br />\none particular sport. Thus, the<br />\nmembers are more than qualified<br />\nto vote on rule changes,<br />\ninterpretations,, and protests of<br />\ngames that have been played. In<br />\ndeciding on protests and petitions<br />\nto the Board concerning teams or<br />\nindividuals, decisions are made in<br />\nlight of the Board's goal which is<br />\nto promote maximum<br />\nparticipation and competition in<br />\n<br />\nany particular sport. In certain<br />\nspecial cases, going by the letter of<br />\nthe law would be directly contrary<br />\nto our goals.<br />\nFinally, th-e members are<br />\nselected to run the individual<br />\nsports on the basis of their<br />\nknowledge of the sport and their<br />\nexperience in organizing that sport,<br />\nnot on a first come first serve basis.<br />\nAs stated before, some new<br />\nmembers are selected because of an<br />\nexpansive knowledge of a<br />\nparticular sport and they are thus<br />\nappointed to run that sport. The<br />\nparticipants can be assured that the<br />\nmembers running each sport are<br />\nthe most qualified people on the<br />\nBoard to run that sport.<br />\nMr. Brown's arguments and<br />\nobjections concerning the Board<br />\nare given away by his statement in<br />\nthe beginning of his letter \"...to<br />\nthe best of my knowledge...\"<br />\nObviously, his knowledge of the<br />\nintramural program is very limited,<br />\nand he therefore should not be so<br />\nhasty to criticize it. I am sure Mr.<br />\nBrown's rejection for membership<br />\nto the Board last Spring did not<br />\ninfluence his thinking, especially<br />\nwhen his arguments are reduced to<br />\nname calling in his recent letter.<br />\nAs for Mr. Tillem's and the<br />\nStudent Council's complaints<br />\nabout running the Goucher Gallop<br />\non Yom Kippur; all I can say is<br />\nthat this year's gallop had more<br />\nparticipation than any gallop run<br />\nin the last five years. B.I.A.<br />\nbasketball last Spring was played<br />\non Good Friday. Those of the faith<br />\nhave the choice of personally<br />\nparticipating in the event or not.<br />\nScheduling of B.I.A. events is very<br />\ntight, and we are sorry if anyone<br />\nwas excluded in this case due to<br />\ntheir observance of the religious<br />\nholiday.<br />\nNeil Hazard<br />\nPres., Board of Intramural Athletics<br />\n<br />\ngui<br />\n\u2018;.,.G\"111k.

But when the game had<br />\nended, Hopkins had run<br />\nWashington and Lee off the field<br />\nk3n route to a 6-1 victory.<br />\nFrom the opening kick-off,<br />\nHopkins was in control of the<br />\ngame. They combined excellent<br />\npassing and accurate shots to<br />\ncontrol the ball most of the<br />\ngame. Ami Cohen, a defensive<br />\nback was injured early in the first<br />\nhalf in a collision with a<br />\nWashington and Lee lineman and<br />\nwas forced- out of the game.<br />\nFortunately, Hopkins maintained<br />\nsuch good control of the action<br />\nthat Cohen's services were not<br />\nsorely missed on defense.<br />\nThe Hopkins defensemen were<br />\nable to watch most of the first<br />\nhalf from mid-field as the<br />\nHopkins offensive unit pressured<br />\nWashington and Lee<br />\ncontinuously.<br />\nRight wing Phil Heiter opened<br />\nthe scoring for Hopkins at 13:55.<br />\nHe grabbed a pass from left wing<br />\nRobert Arguero, dribbled into<br />\nposition and banged a hard shot<br />\nfrom 20 yards into the nets for<br />\nan unassisted goal.<br />\nHopkins continued its attack<br />\n<br />\nand at 32:52, Joe Rutkowski<br />\ncrossed a pass in front of the<br />\ngoal.

Hartman was an offensive<br />\nstandout most of the game.<br />\ntaking a majority of Hopkins<br />\nshots on goal. He was<br />\ncontinuously looking and driving<br />\nfor the goal. Hartman's goal<br />\nended the scoring in the first half<br />\nat 3-0.<br />\nHopkins nearly had another<br />\ngoal when Dennis Doherty took a<br />\ncrossing pass from Al Tramposch<br />\nand banged a hard shot that<br />\nrattled the cross bar of the goal<br />\nand deflected away.<br />\nThe first half statistics showed<br />\nthat Hopkins had 15 shots on<br />\ngoal to 6 for Washington and<br />\nLee.

For the University,<br />\nit's a quiet time.<br />\nBut the trustees, many of whom show up on campus only for<br />\nthe Board's thrice-yearly meetings, ought to take a closer look<br />\nat what is going on here. If they did, they would find the Student Council and Homewood's Vice President at odds over the<br />\nDiscipline Code approved by the Council three weeks ago.

When the applicants<br />\ncome out of only two fraternities,<br />\nthe majority of the representatives<br />\nselected will be from those<br />\nfraternities. Mr. Brown's idea of<br />\nmanditory participation from all<br />\ncampus fraternities would result in<br />\npeople on the Board who _don't<br />\ncare about the B.I.A. and who<br />\nwould not be willing to put forth<br />\nthe time and effort required to<br />\norganize a given sport. These sports<br />\nwould probably end up being run<br />\nmuch less professionally and<br />\nefficiently.<br />\nApplicants are also selected on<br />\ntheir general knowledge and<br />\nbackground of all sports, and on<br />\nany great wealth of knowledge of<br />\none particular sport. Thus, the<br />\nmembers are more than qualified<br />\nto vote on rule changes,<br />\ninterpretations,, and protests of<br />\ngames that have been played. In<br />\ndeciding on protests and petitions<br />\nto the Board concerning teams or<br />\nindividuals, decisions are made in<br />\nlight of the Board's goal which is<br />\nto promote maximum<br />\nparticipation and competition in<br /><br />\nany particular sport. In certain<br />\nspecial cases, going by the letter of<br />\nthe law would be directly contrary<br />\nto our goals.<br />\nFinally, th-e members are<br />\nselected to run the individual<br />\nsports on the basis of their<br />\nknowledge of the sport and their<br />\nexperience in organizing that sport,<br />\nnot on a first come first serve basis.<br />\nAs stated before, some new<br />\nmembers are selected because of an<br />\nexpansive knowledge of a<br />\nparticular sport and they are thus<br />\nappointed to run that sport. The<br />\nparticipants can be assured that the<br />\nmembers running each sport are<br />\nthe most qualified people on the<br />\nBoard to run that sport.<br />\nMr. Brown's arguments and<br />\nobjections concerning the Board<br />\nare given away by his statement in<br />\nthe beginning of his letter \"...to<br />\nthe best of my knowledge...\"<br />\nObviously, his knowledge of the<br />\nintramural program is very limited,<br />\nand he therefore should not be so<br />\nhasty to criticize it. I am sure Mr.<br />\nBrown's rejection for membership<br />\nto the Board last Spring did not<br />\ninfluence his thinking, especially<br />\nwhen his arguments are reduced to<br />\nname calling in his recent letter.<br />\nAs for Mr. Tillem's and the<br />\nStudent Council's complaints<br />\nabout running the Goucher Gallop<br />\non Yom Kippur; all I can say is<br />\nthat this year's gallop had more<br />\nparticipation than any gallop run<br />\nin the last five years. B.I.A.<br />\nbasketball last Spring was played<br />\non Good Friday. Those of the faith<br />\nhave the choice of personally<br />\nparticipating in the event or not.<br />\nScheduling of B.I.A. events is very<br />\ntight, and we are sorry if anyone<br />\nwas excluded in this case due to<br />\ntheir observance of the religious<br />\nholiday.<br />\nNeil Hazard<br />\nPres., Board of Intramural Athletics<br /><br />\ngui<br />\n\u2018;.,.G\"111k.

He grew up in East<br />\nBaltimore and attended high<br />\nschool at Calvert Hall where he<br />\nwas an all around athlete.

He<br />\nstarted out at quarterback, but<br />\nduring his three years of varsity<br />\nexperience at Bucknell, he<br />\nmanaged to play every position<br />\nexcept tackle.<br />\nIn 1963, Cox moved back to<br />\nhis alma mater, Calvert Hall,<br />\nwhere he was assistant football<br />\ncoach as well as head J.V.<br />\nbaseball coach. When asked<br />\nabout his 3 years at Calvert Hall,<br />\nCoach Cox said, \"I helped<br />\nestablish the winning tradition<br />\nwhich remains there even today,<br />\nmaking them one of Baltimore's<br />\nperennial football powerhouses.\"<br />\nAfter a three year stint as head<br />\nfootball coach at Bishop<br />\nO'Connell High School in<br />\nArlington, Virginia where he also<br />\nestablished a winning tradition,<br />\nCox came to Hopkins as<br />\ndefensive line coach in 1969'.

But when the game had<br />\nended, Hopkins had run<br />\nWashington and Lee off the field<br />\nk3n route to a 6-1 victory.<br />\nFrom the opening kick-off,<br />\nHopkins was in control of the<br />\ngame. They combined excellent<br />\npassing and accurate shots to<br />\ncontrol the ball most of the<br />\ngame.
