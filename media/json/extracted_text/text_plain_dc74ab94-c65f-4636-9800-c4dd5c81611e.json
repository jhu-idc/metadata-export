He was<br />\nthe first signer of the Declaration of Independence and was the<br />\nfirst Governor of Massachusetts.<br />\nJohn Hancock was born at Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1737.<br />\nHe graduated from Harvard College, and entering upon his<br />\nuncle's business became a successful merchant in Boston. He<br />\ngained much in social power and in wealth, being meanwhile<br />\njustly popular for his integrity and ability.<br />\nHe was in 1765-1770 a selectman of Boston and a member of<br />\nthe general court. With Samuel Adams he led the Massachusetts Whigs,and only escaped capture at Lexington and Concord<br />\nby virtue of the valiant fight by the Minute Men on the \"Nineteenth of April in '75.\"<br />\nJohn Hancock was subsequently known in various positions:<br />\nas President of the Continental Congress, as Major-General of<br />\nthe Massachusetts military forces, as President of the Constitutional Convention. He died at Quincy,Massachusetts,October<br />\neighth, 1793.<br />\nThe historical position of John Hancock is unique in State<br />\nand Nation. He wielded great political influence but was always<br />\nliberal and public-spirited. His name is most prominent as a<br />\nWhig leader during the American Revolution in such events<br />\nas the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party and the battles<br />\nof Lexington and Concord.<br />\nJohn Hancock signed his name first to the Declaration of<br />\nIndependence. He thus risked his own \"life,liberty, and pursuit<br />\nof happiness\"that these privileges might be obtained for others<br />\nto enjoy. To this end he \"pledged his life, his fortune, and his<br />\nsacred honor.\"<br />\nThat he was popular and efficient may be judged from the<br />\nfact that he was for ten years Governor of Massachusetts, being elected annually to this office by popular vote.<br />\n<br />\nJ<br />\n<br />\nMathematics<br />\nPhilosophy<br />\nPolitics<br />\nPsychology<br />\nSchool Music<br />\nSpanish<br />\n<br />\nFor further information<br />\n<br />\na<br />\nJohn Hancock insured the life of the Ration\u2014<br />\nWe will insure your life with the same integrity<br />\n<br />\nSee<br />\nDR.

He was<br />\nthe first signer of the Declaration of Independence and was the<br />\nfirst Governor of Massachusetts.<br />\nJohn Hancock was born at Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1737.<br />\nHe graduated from Harvard College, and entering upon his<br />\nuncle's business became a successful merchant in Boston. He<br />\ngained much in social power and in wealth, being meanwhile<br />\njustly popular for his integrity and ability.<br />\nHe was in 1765-1770 a selectman of Boston and a member of<br />\nthe general court. With Samuel Adams he led the Massachusetts Whigs,and only escaped capture at Lexington and Concord<br />\nby virtue of the valiant fight by the Minute Men on the \"Nineteenth of April in '75.\"<br />\nJohn Hancock was subsequently known in various positions:<br />\nas President of the Continental Congress, as Major-General of<br />\nthe Massachusetts military forces, as President of the Constitutional Convention. He died at Quincy,Massachusetts,October<br />\neighth, 1793.<br />\nThe historical position of John Hancock is unique in State<br />\nand Nation. He wielded great political influence but was always<br />\nliberal and public-spirited. His name is most prominent as a<br />\nWhig leader during the American Revolution in such events<br />\nas the Boston Massacre, the Boston Tea Party and the battles<br />\nof Lexington and Concord.<br />\nJohn Hancock signed his name first to the Declaration of<br />\nIndependence. He thus risked his own \"life,liberty, and pursuit<br />\nof happiness\"that these privileges might be obtained for others<br />\nto enjoy. To this end he \"pledged his life, his fortune, and his<br />\nsacred honor.\"<br />\nThat he was popular and efficient may be judged from the<br />\nfact that he was for ten years Governor of Massachusetts, being elected annually to this office by popular vote.<br /><br />\nJ<br /><br />\nMathematics<br />\nPhilosophy<br />\nPolitics<br />\nPsychology<br />\nSchool Music<br />\nSpanish<br /><br />\nFor further information<br /><br />\na<br />\nJohn Hancock insured the life of the Ration\u2014<br />\nWe will insure your life with the same integrity<br /><br />\nSee<br />\nDR.
