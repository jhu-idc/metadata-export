Of these needs the<br />\nmost imperative relate to the removal of the University to Homewood<br />\nand the erection there of such buildings as will provide accommodations<br />\nfor both graduate and undergradHomewood is<br />\nuate departments.<br />\na tract of 120 acres, admirably located, in a portion of the city which is<br />\nrapidly becoming one of the delightful residential sections of Baltimore.<br />\nExtensive improvements in the way<br />\nof parks and boulevards have already<br />\nbeen made by the city authorities and<br />\nduring the last three years noteworthy changes have been made in<br />\nthe appearance of what was a decade<br />\nago an open area of largely unoccupied country. The extension of the<br />\ntrolley system has brought this section of Baltimore into close connection with the centre of the city and<br />\nthe time is ripe for a movement<br />\nwhich will transfer by slow stages<br />\nthe University from its present unattractive surroundings to a site<br />\nwhich will offer every advantage<br />\nfrom the standpoint of health and<br />\nbeauty.<br />\nThe perspective view of the proposed buildings at Homewood present<br />\na picture of remarkable architectural<br />\nand physical charm.

Symmetrical in plan and harmonious in style<br />\nthey find their only parallel among<br />\nstructures similarly designed beforehand, as in the case of those of the<br />\nUniversity of California to which<br />\nthey bear a certain resemblance, as<br />\nfar as the ground plan is concerned.<br />\nThe main group occupying the centre of the Homewood tract is arranged somewhat after the lines of<br />\na great cathedral. The library occupies the place of the chancel and<br />\nLady Chapel, the chapel and museums that of the left transept, and<br />\nthe administration and<br />\nacademic<br />\nbuildings with the gateway that of<br />\nthe right transept.<br />\nAlong the<br />\naisles, corresponding in position to<br />\nthe lesser chapels of a cathedral are<br />\nthe six laboratories, three on each<br />\nside, while at the end where would<br />\nstand the great front of the cathedral<br />\nis the chief museum, itself built<br />\nabout two inner courts. The entire<br />\ninner portion, the nave and the choir,<br />\nforms the oblong court, divided into<br />\ntwo quadrangles. At a short distance to the north, running along the<br />\nedge of Charles Street, and former<br />\nMerriman's Lane, now the University Parkway, lie the buildings of the<br />\ncollege dormitories and gymnasium\u2014<br />\nt.early a dozen in number, terminating in the present athletic field, upon<br />\nthe southeastern side of which the<br />\ngymnasium will stand.

Thus the present Carroll mansion, which will remain to<br />\nflank the entrance driveway on the<br />\nnorth as the future president's house<br />\nof similar design will flank it on the<br />\nsouth, will strike no discordant note<br />\nin the general scheme.

The<br />\ngrowth of suburban life, the encroachment of business interests upoa<br />\nthe old residential districts, the increasing undesirableness, from the<br />\nstandpoint of health and physical<br />\nneeds, of a location in the heart of a<br />\ncity are all forcing the University to<br />\nchange its situation. The present position offers little opportunity for<br />\nexpansion. Cramped and crowded,<br />\nexposed to the dust and dirt of the<br />\ncity, and in certain of its quarters<br />\nhampered by inadequate light and<br />\ndisturbed by persistent noise the<br />\nUniversity needs the openness, cleanliness, and quiet of the larger area.<br />\nADDITIONAL OBJECTS<br />\nAmong the important objects for<br />\nwhich the new fund is to be used are<br />\na school of engineering, a law school,<br />\na school for teachers, a department<br />\nof preventive medicine, and a pathological institute.<br />\nSchool of Higher Engineering. \u2014<br />\nThere is a great demand at the present time for such an institution of<br />\napplied science to which the graduates of technical schools and also<br />\npracticing engineers may come and<br />\nconduct research work in the most<br />\nproficient manner. Such a school<br />\nwould bear the same relation to the<br />\ntechnical schools as a university does<br />\nto a college. The development of<br />\ntechnical instruction, it seems, has<br />\nnot kept pace with the marvelous industrial growth of the country and<br />\nthere is probably no university in the<br />\ncountry which is better able to undertake such an important work as is<br />\nIt<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nis expected that this project will ap-<br /><br />\npeal very strongly to the large busiA PROGRESSIVE STEP.<br />\nness interests of the country which<br />\nhave been spending millions of dolknow<br />\nis now selling his<br />\nlars upon the developing of new processes of work and are just coming<br />\nto realize the importance of developand having all the good points of made to measing as well trained scientists in their<br />\nown particular lines.<br />\nure clothes,<br />\nand $2o.00.<br />\nLaw School. \u2014 Another extension<br />\nof the University which will appeal<br />\nparticularly to the citizens of Baltimore and the South generally is the<br />\n19 EAST FAYF-TTE STREET.<br />\nproposed institution of a law school<br />\nof the highest grade.
