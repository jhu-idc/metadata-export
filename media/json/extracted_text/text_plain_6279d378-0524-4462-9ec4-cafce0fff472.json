In a company the size of<br />\nDu Pont there are opportunities for growth along either line.<br />\nIn my own case, I've followed the route of diversification<br />\n\u2014and I think you'll find that's the general procedure when<br />\na fellow is interested in administrative work.<br />\nFor example, after graduation I started work in the research lab at Du Pont's Niagara Falls plant. That was followed by two years of process improvement work, and a<br />\nstretch as assistant supervisor over one of the plant areas.<br />\nNext, I spent a few years in liaison on the design and construction of our first full-scale plant for making nylon intermediates from furfural. Then, I had assignrnents on \"plant<br />\nstart up,\" and production supervision before I was given hay<br />\npresent post. I was made Assistant Director of Research for<br />\nDu Pont's Electrochemicals Department last August.<br />\nYou see, variety of assignments means contact with new<br />\nmen and with constantly changing problems. That keeps<br />\ninterest alive. It leads to growth, too, because it provides a<br />\nbroad base of experience for future responsibilities.<br />\nOn the other hand,some fellows prefer to become specialists in a particular field\u2014and Du Pont has many opportunities for that type of profescional growth, too. In our<br />\nresearch, development and design groups we have experts<br />\non distillation, mass transfer, thermodynamics\u2014and most<br />\nanything else you'd care to mention in the field of engineering. These men are respected throughout the whole company<br />\nfor their technical knowledge.<br />\nWhichever route you choose, Cliff\u2014broad or specialized\u2014<br />\nyou'll find that a job well done leads to satisfaction and advancement at Du Pont.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE SIX<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n011rIms lOopkitts Nruni-Kritrr<br />\n<br />\nCORRESPONDENCE<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, May 13, 1951<br />\n<br />\nPlus Ca Change, Plus<br />\nC'est La Meme Chose<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThis is to inform the Hopkins<br />\nPublished every Friday during regular sessions of The Johns Hopkins University except during examinations and college holiday periods, by undercommunit<br />\ny that the last meeting<br />\ngraduates of the University.

We<br />\nthought that the Homecoming issue would be an auspicious occasion to take the plunge and we had a ready-made topic in<br />\nlacrosse, past and present, and maybe a short dim look into the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nFor our raw material we didn't have to look much past the<br />\ndesk as that giant of the publishing world, Time Inc., was<br />\nthoughtful enough to send us an advance release of an article<br />\nappearing in the current issue of their publication, Sports Illustrated. It seems that a gentleman by the name of Booton<br />\nHerndon went down Annapolis way to get the dope for his<br />\narticle \"Skull 'em! Hip 'Em! Score!\" The title sounds more<br />\nlike some words the witch of Endor might have uttered, \u2022 but<br />\nunder this label Herndon gets in some plugs for Hopkins via<br />\nthe sage utterings of one Dinty Moore, Navys lacrosse coach for<br />\n19 years.<br />\nWe were sort of disappointed that Mr. Herndon didn't get<br />\naround to talking with some of our Hopkins experts like \"Doc\"<br />\nMorrill or Bill Logan, but at least we did save our honor in that<br />\nMoore wore the Black and Blue himself, as an undergraduate.<br />\nFrom this article we learned such things as the fact that<br />\nlacrosse was brought to this country by some Baltimorians in<br />\n1880 after seeing the game in Canada. Another was that \"a<br />\nteam gets as many points for losing to some Class A powerhouse<br />\nlike Johns Hopkins as for beating some Class C. patsy like Ohio<br />\nState.\" We were also delighted to read that the mothers from the<br />\nexclusive Roland Park and Guilford sections gather on the sidelines of lacrosse games between such teams as Friends, Gilman,<br />\nand McDonogh and shout such horrid things as \"'Cream him,<br />\nDonald!'\"and\"'Lay on the wood on, Roger!'\"<br />\nThe Great Turnbull<br />\ngut the part that interested us most among the gory description of the game, was that about the late, great Jack Turnbull of Hopkins. Jack, who was killed in the World War II while<br />\nserving as a bomber pilot, was All-American twice and is called<br />\nthe greatest lacrosse player of all time. The story describes such<br />\nplays as Turnbull firing a 30-yard goal after being flipped over<br />\non his head. But the one that stood out in Dinty Moore's mind<br />\nwas a feat by Turnbull in a Navy-Hopkins game. With 30 seconds to go and the score tied 2-2, Turnbull took the ball and<br />\nheaded for the crease. He was met hard by two big Navy defensemen, both football players. But at the instant that these two<br />\nmen hit him, Turnbull fired the winning goal, using the defensemen as a shield to confuse the goalie.<br />\nWe don't expect to see a Jack Turnbull pulling the ball<br />\ngame out of the fire tomorrow, because how many greatests of<br />\nall-time do you see? But in as much as limbs were made for<br />\nsports editors to climb out on, we predict that we'll see a \"right<br />\nsmart bit\" of lacrosse playing tomorrow and it wouldn't surprise us too*much to see Navy really having to scrap 10 save<br />\ntheir laurels.<br />\n<br />\n40010.<br />\n<br />\nTerror Nine Invades<br />\nHomewood Saturday<br />\n<br />\nMaryland's baseball team defeated the Jays, 6-1 in a game played<br />\nat College Park Wednesday.

Then, I had assignrnents on \"plant<br />\nstart up,\" and production supervision before I was given hay<br />\npresent post. I was made Assistant Director of Research for<br />\nDu Pont's Electrochemicals Department last August.<br />\nYou see, variety of assignments means contact with new<br />\nmen and with constantly changing problems. That keeps<br />\ninterest alive. It leads to growth, too, because it provides a<br />\nbroad base of experience for future responsibilities.<br />\nOn the other hand,some fellows prefer to become specialists in a particular field\u2014and Du Pont has many opportunities for that type of profescional growth, too. In our<br />\nresearch, development and design groups we have experts<br />\non distillation, mass transfer, thermodynamics\u2014and most<br />\nanything else you'd care to mention in the field of engineering.

We<br />\nthought that the Homecoming issue would be an auspicious occasion to take the plunge and we had a ready-made topic in<br />\nlacrosse, past and present, and maybe a short dim look into the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nFor our raw material we didn't have to look much past the<br />\ndesk as that giant of the publishing world, Time Inc., was<br />\nthoughtful enough to send us an advance release of an article<br />\nappearing in the current issue of their publication, Sports Illustrated. It seems that a gentleman by the name of Booton<br />\nHerndon went down Annapolis way to get the dope for his<br />\narticle \"Skull 'em! Hip 'Em! Score!\" The title sounds more<br />\nlike some words the witch of Endor might have uttered, \u2022 but<br />\nunder this label Herndon gets in some plugs for Hopkins via<br />\nthe sage utterings of one Dinty Moore, Navys lacrosse coach for<br />\n19 years.<br />\nWe were sort of disappointed that Mr. Herndon didn't get<br />\naround to talking with some of our Hopkins experts like \"Doc\"<br />\nMorrill or Bill Logan, but at least we did save our honor in that<br />\nMoore wore the Black and Blue himself, as an undergraduate.<br />\nFrom this article we learned such things as the fact that<br />\nlacrosse was brought to this country by some Baltimorians in<br />\n1880 after seeing the game in Canada. Another was that \"a<br />\nteam gets as many points for losing to some Class A powerhouse<br />\nlike Johns Hopkins as for beating some Class C. patsy like Ohio<br />\nState.\" We were also delighted to read that the mothers from the<br />\nexclusive Roland Park and Guilford sections gather on the sidelines of lacrosse games between such teams as Friends, Gilman,<br />\nand McDonogh and shout such horrid things as \"'Cream him,<br />\nDonald!'\"and\"'Lay on the wood on, Roger!'\"<br />\nThe Great Turnbull<br />\ngut the part that interested us most among the gory description of the game, was that about the late, great Jack Turnbull of Hopkins. Jack, who was killed in the World War II while<br />\nserving as a bomber pilot, was All-American twice and is called<br />\nthe greatest lacrosse player of all time. The story describes such<br />\nplays as Turnbull firing a 30-yard goal after being flipped over<br />\non his head. But the one that stood out in Dinty Moore's mind<br />\nwas a feat by Turnbull in a Navy-Hopkins game. With 30 seconds to go and the score tied 2-2, Turnbull took the ball and<br />\nheaded for the crease. He was met hard by two big Navy defensemen, both football players. But at the instant that these two<br />\nmen hit him, Turnbull fired the winning goal, using the defensemen as a shield to confuse the goalie.<br />\nWe don't expect to see a Jack Turnbull pulling the ball<br />\ngame out of the fire tomorrow, because how many greatests of<br />\nall-time do you see? But in as much as limbs were made for<br />\nsports editors to climb out on, we predict that we'll see a \"right<br />\nsmart bit\" of lacrosse playing tomorrow and it wouldn't surprise us too*much to see Navy really having to scrap 10 save<br />\ntheir laurels.<br /><br />\n40010.<br /><br />\nTerror Nine Invades<br />\nHomewood Saturday<br /><br />\nMaryland's baseball team defeated the Jays, 6-1 in a game played<br />\nat College Park Wednesday.
