It may justifiably<br />\nbe argued that a lack of money and physicial facilities<br />\nimpede widening the curriculum, but no other excuse is<br />\nacceptable.<br />\nOur pain is increased by the closure of desirable<br />\nMcCoy courses to undergraduates, on the weak grounds<br />\nthat they are set up for adult education only. Is this to<br />\npresume undergraduates are less capable than adult students, or that the reverse is true? Moreover, McCoy students generally pay less per credit per course than we do.<br />\nWe note too that the faculty is definitely shirking its<br />\nduty to teach when it (1) instructs usually for no more than<br />\na general norm of four hours a week and (2) does not<br />\noffer some of its best and most interesting and<br />\nvaluable courses every year, but, rather, condescends to<br />\ngive them every other year.<br />\nMoreover, the advising system, depending as it does in<br />\ngreat part on the student for his initiative and ability to<br />\nmake it function, nevertheless involves definite faculty<br />\nresponsibility\u2014the responsibility to at least be in one's<br />\noffices on the two days a year when undergraduates are<br />\nrequired by the Registrar's office to see their advisors<br />\nwithout receiving what, in many other cases, is curt rebuke<br />\nor token acknowledgement of troubles.<br />\nPerhaps the seventeen who failed out this term would<br />\nhave not done so if they had been treated with more<br />\nfaculty time and consideration.

No doubt the professors<br />\nmust have time and freedom to do research, for their<br />\nability to teach depends, partly on their ability to learn<br />\nnew things for themselves and others.

MARYLAND<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nBomb Scare<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nWhat should be done when a<br />\nrabble-rouser appears on the<br />\nlocal scene? There are those who<br />\nurge an all-out program of the<br />\nwidest publicity and organized<br />\nmass protest aimed at \"arousing<br />\nthe community.\" But there are<br />\nothers who remain skeptical of<br />\nthe wisdom of the \"aggressive\"<br />\npublic approach in dealing with<br />\nthe professional hatemonger, no<br />\nmatter how useful that method<br />\nmay be in other situations.<br />\nThe rabble-rouser is altogether<br />\ndependent upon hate-mongering;<br />\nfor public attention and support. It is his whole stock-intrade. Publicity is not merely<br />\nincense in his nostrils\u2014it is his<br />\nvery life-blood. Certain vermin<br />\nthrive in darkness: here is a<br />\nspecies that spawns and flourishes only in the spotlight. If<br />\nwe are interested in an effective<br />\nantidote for rabble-rousers, some<br />\nother technique seems to be indicated than feeding them large<br />\ndoses of the food that makes<br />\nthem great.<br />\nSilent treatment is the best<br />\ntreatment\u2014backed by a manysided, long-range program, not<br />\nagainst the lone demagogue, but<br />\nagainst the basic evil of race<br />\nhate. But the silent treatment<br />\nrequires self-restraint. Agencies<br />\nthat practice the method keep<br />\n<br />\nthemselves informed of the<br />\nactivities of anti-Semites and<br />\ncirculate the information to<br />\njournalists, radio commentators,<br />\nand others who mold opinion.<br />\ndition discourages, and American<br />\nAnd to circulate the truth about<br />\nrabble-rousers through private<br />\nchannels requires far more work<br />\nand planning than proclaiming<br />\nit in the press.<br />\nThe silent treatment also has<br />\nthe task of explaining to people<br />\nwhy legislation prohibiting the<br />\nincitement of racial and religious<br />\nhatred does not exist and would<br />\nnot be effective. American trapublic opinion does not seem<br />\nreceptive to further limitations<br />\non freedom of speech. Newspapers are especially quick to<br />\nexpress displeasure at the suggestion that new curbs be placed<br />\non printed matter. Moreover, the<br />\nmere existence of a law cannot<br />\nprevent talk.<br />\nThe intelligent approach, above<br />\nall, requires understanding the<br />\nrabble-rouser's place in the<br />\nwhole of American life. At present, rabble-rousing is disreputable in Amerita. Like adultery,<br />\nintolerance is considered far<br />\nmore heinous when publicly proclaimed than when privately<br />\npracticed. Those who have employed the silent therapy have<br />\nhelped to keep rabble-rousing in<br />\nits present public status\u2014as a<br />\nlunatic-fringe activity. The antidote for rabble-rousing is much<br />\nthe same as for all racial and<br />\n<br />\nreligious prejudice. The way to<br />\nfight the rabble-rousers is by<br />\nfostering attitudes that reject<br />\nand negate the purposes, techniques and concepts of racial<br />\nand religious hostility whereever<br />\nand whenever. \u2022<br />\nS.

An authoritative source<br />\ntold the News-Letter some weeks ago that a new library<br />\nhas been needed for fifteen years. Plans announced today,<br />\nwhen developed, will satisfy the need.<br />\nBut undergraduates will question whether the site<br />\nof the new building will destroy Homewood's beauty.

We have a right<br />\nto expect something more than we are now getting for our<br />\ndollars, and we are getting less than one would expect in<br />\na curriculum of \"one of the nation's leading private universities.\"<br />\nCourses are lacking in Russian, Chinese and other<br />\nimportant languages presently essential in today's world<br />\nstudies in developing cultural and political areas, American literature and drama and music also are wanting. The<br />\nArt and Social Relations departments are embryonic, at<br />\nbest, and even they are for graduate students primarily.<br />\nIs it that there is no felt need for such studies; that<br />\nthere are no qualified professors here or able to be hired<br />\nto teach because of tight budgeting; that the qualified<br />\nteachers here are too busy with research, or that the present curriculum is deemed satisfactory? It may justifiably<br />\nbe argued that a lack of money and physicial facilities<br />\nimpede widening the curriculum, but no other excuse is<br />\nacceptable.<br />\nOur pain is increased by the closure of desirable<br />\nMcCoy courses to undergraduates, on the weak grounds<br />\nthat they are set up for adult education only.

There are those who<br />\nurge an all-out program of the<br />\nwidest publicity and organized<br />\nmass protest aimed at \"arousing<br />\nthe community.\" But there are<br />\nothers who remain skeptical of<br />\nthe wisdom of the \"aggressive\"<br />\npublic approach in dealing with<br />\nthe professional hatemonger, no<br />\nmatter how useful that method<br />\nmay be in other situations.<br />\nThe rabble-rouser is altogether<br />\ndependent upon hate-mongering;<br />\nfor public attention and support. It is his whole stock-intrade. Publicity is not merely<br />\nincense in his nostrils\u2014it is his<br />\nvery life-blood. Certain vermin<br />\nthrive in darkness: here is a<br />\nspecies that spawns and flourishes only in the spotlight.

But the silent treatment<br />\nrequires self-restraint.

American trapublic opinion does not seem<br />\nreceptive to further limitations<br />\non freedom of speech. Newspapers are especially quick to<br />\nexpress displeasure at the suggestion that new curbs be placed<br />\non printed matter. Moreover, the<br />\nmere existence of a law cannot<br />\nprevent talk.<br />\nThe intelligent approach, above<br />\nall, requires understanding the<br />\nrabble-rouser's place in the<br />\nwhole of American life. At present, rabble-rousing is disreputable in Amerita. Like adultery,<br />\nintolerance is considered far<br />\nmore heinous when publicly proclaimed than when privately<br />\npracticed. Those who have employed the silent therapy have<br />\nhelped to keep rabble-rousing in<br />\nits present public status\u2014as a<br />\nlunatic-fringe activity. The antidote for rabble-rousing is much<br />\nthe same as for all racial and<br /><br />\nreligious prejudice. The way to<br />\nfight the rabble-rousers is by<br />\nfostering attitudes that reject<br />\nand negate the purposes, techniques and concepts of racial<br />\nand religious hostility whereever<br />\nand whenever. \u2022<br />\nS.
