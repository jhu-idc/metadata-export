Unless you hail from Long<br />\nIsland or Baltimore you are probably unfamiliar with the great ol' Indian<br />\ngame and its mystique. Lacrosse is as much of an institution at Hopkins as<br />\nthe hospital or the med school. The tradition is practically as old as the<br />\nUniversity itself, going back into the mid-1880s when Hopkins was one of<br />\nthe first schools to start playing lacrosse. The sport took hold in Bawlamer<br />\nand that nurtured the sport at Hopkins and kept it growing. The tradition<br />\nwas enhanced when the University's team representedthe United States in<br />\nthe only two Olympic games in which lacrosse was included -- 1928 and<br />\n1932.<br />\nLacrosse is the coming out season at Hopkins. People you've never seen<br />\nbefore and never will see again will be in attendance opening day against<br />\nYale arrl 'every home every home game thereafter. Lacrosse has even been<br />\nknown to draw out the nerdiest of nerds from the bowels of D level (albeit<br />\nfor only the first half!) Lacrosse brings Hopkins recognition the likes of<br />\nwhich few other University activities can equal. The cover of Sports<br />\nIllustrated was once adorned with the \"spring thing\" at Homewood.<br />\nLacrosse is the Great<br />\nEqualizer. While other sports may suffer their ups and downs, the lean years<br />\nare few and far between for \"the fastest game on foot\". While other Blue Jay<br />\nsquads struggle on a level with the Haverfords and Swarthmores,<br />\nMontclair States, Galludets etc. lacrosse allows Hopkins rooters the luxury of<br />\ncompeting with the Marylands, Navys and Virginias on equal footing while<br />\nstanding far above the normal shrines of collegiate sports, be it Ohio State,<br />\nUCLA, Penn State et al.<br />\nLacrosse is the elixir of youth which draws former Blue Jays back to the<br />\nnest to be revitalized and lets them relive the old glorious days of ought-two<br />\n\"when we did things we ought not too, hch, heh, Harry!\" It brings<br />\nobscenities and threats of violence to the lips of even the meekest-looking<br />\nseptogenarian. \"One hundred, and eight, one hundred and nine, one hundred<br />\nand ten, WE WANT MORE!\"<br />\nLacrosse brings Hopkins fans down to the blue-collar, beer guzzling,<br />\nreferee-baiting level of all other sports fans.

What's she doing here? Isn't Hopkins an<br />\nall-boy's school?\"<br />\nNot anymore, a passing wag might have commented<br />\nback in the fall of 1970 when, as part of a new co-ed<br />\nPolicy, 94 female transfer students were admitted to<br />\nHopkins. Previously the only women admitted were grad<br />\nstudents or some undergrads as \"special students.\"<br />\nThe reaction to these first female pioneers at Hopkins<br />\nwas strangely mixed. There seemed to be a mystique as to<br />\nwhat an actual woman student was. Some professors<br />\nactually believed the presence of women was to act as a<br />\nkind of \"civilizing influence\" in the classroom<br />\nIn an effort to clarify misconceptions and raise public<br />\nconsciousness of women's role in the academic<br />\ncommunity, the M. Carey Thomas Women's Center was<br />\ncreated. The center's members worked toward the<br />\nacceptance of women on campus and helped women in<br />\ntheir efforts to adjust to their new surroundings.<br />\nThese first efforts focused on basic issues such as the<br />\nestablishment of health facilities for women, and in '73<br />\nsponsored a festival, \"Next Step,\" which showed the<br />\npositive outgrowths of women's ambitions.<br />\nSince that time, the Women's Center has lost<br />\nmomentum because many of its members have graduated<br />\nand women, at large, have become a more integrated part<br />\nof the Hopkins community. Today, there are 607<br />\nundergraduate female students at Hopkins. Their interests<br />\nrange from the Humanities to the Natural Sciences<br />\n(Natural Sciences being, of course, the largest area of<br />\nenrollment) with full participation in the college<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nThe question still remains, however, as to what women<br />\nare all about, what their role is in an academic setting, and<br />\nwhat it conceivably should be. In response to these<br />\nquestions, a women's committee was informally<br />\nestablished a year and a half ago to discuss the idea of<br />\nwomen's programs at Hopkins. The group is composed of<br />\n<br />\nmale and female faculty members, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students, who are concerned about<br />\nwomen's existence at Hopkins.<br />\nAs a result of their concern, several courses have been<br />\noffered that are specifically geared to women as subject<br />\nmatter and to women's influence through the feminist<br />\nmovement. Until this point, women's courses had been<br />\noffered on an irregular basis. In the spring of'71, the first<br />\nwomen's course was offered, but not given for credit.<br />\nSubsequent courses have been offered for credit but not<br />\nthrough any kind of organized movement.<br />\nThe philosophy behind the present group bases on the<br />\ndevelopment of an ongoing core of courses to be offered<br />\non a regular basis. According to Donna Haroway, a<br />\nprofessor in the History of Science Department, these<br />\ncourses will take \"an eclectic point of view and touch on<br />\nmany different concerns.\" Examples of this are issues<br />\ntouching on political theory, art, politics, and basic<br />\nprimate behavior.<br />\nThe four courses offered this year by the women's<br />\nstudies group have had overwhelming student response<br />\nwith an exceptionally large student turn-out. The specific<br />\n<br />\ncourses offered are: Sexuality and Politics, Women and<br />\nArt, Women and Politics, and Sex, Dominance, and<br />\nAggression. These courses all differ in their approaches.<br />\nFor instance, Sexuality and Politics, taught by Dr. John<br />\nPocock from the History Department, and Nancy<br />\nHartsock, a Political Science professor and editor of the<br />\nfeminist quarterly, Quest concentrates on myths and<br />\nsymbols while Donna Harroway's course focuses on<br />\n\"research used in social and political situations.\"<br />\nNext year, courses offered will include one by Dr. Ron<br />\nWalters of the History Department, called \"Social and<br />\nCultural History of the U.S.\" which will include a section<br />\non the anglo-american family. Other tentative courses will<br />\ncome from the Near Eastern, Classics, and Anthropology<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nAccording to the women's studies group, the failure to<br />\ncreate a women's studies department has been because of<br />\nan effort to bring women's studies into the mainstream of<br />\nacademic disciplines and not regard women as separate<br />\nentities. To this extent, women are seen to be important<br />\nin many areas of academic study. Their inclusion within<br />\nthese areas is equally important.,<br />\nI -M. Davis<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDEfERREd ilUdgMENT ASSURES CREalTEu INTERSESSION<br />\nHopkins students will apparently be able to participate<br />\nin a credited intersession next January. Many advocates of<br />\na credited intersession had feared that a March 15 vote by<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate Studies, recommending<br />\nto the Academic Council that credit for intersession be<br />\nabolished, would doom credit for the voluntary academic<br />\nactivity.<br />\nHowever, the status of intersession received a boost<br />\nwhen the Academic Council motioned to defer judgment<br />\non the issue during their March 23 session. Sigmund<br />\nSuskind, Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies<br />\nand head of CUS, an advisory body to AC, said the issue<br />\nwas<br />\ndeferred<br />\n\"until they get all the facts and<br />\nevaluate the intersession question.\" Unless the AC takes<br />\naction before the end of the year, intersession will retain<br />\nits present 4-1-4 format.<br />\nIf the AC does discuss the issue, it could modify the<br />\nprocedure for the delegation of credit. One idea is to tie<br />\nintersession credits to independent study, with a six-credit<br />\nmaximum per year, said Mark Steinberg, member of the<br />\nStudent Council's Committee on Education. This<br />\ncommittee prepared an<br />\n<br />\nreport which advocated an expanded 4-1-4<br />\nintersession. Neither Deans Suskind or Owen, President<br />\nMuller, or Provost Lonaker take a stand on the<br />\nintersession issue, preferring the Academic Council to<br />\nmake its final decision.<br />\n'I think the issue is pretty much dead for this academic<br />\nyear,\" Steinberg said. \"Many people misconstrued what<br />\nwe (intersession advocates and liasons) were trying to do.<br />\nWe were just .attempting to maintain the same level of<br />\nParticipation and the number of course offerings.\"<br />\nHowever, many faculty members interpreted student<br />\npressure for an expanded intersession as a proposal for<br />\nan<br />\nintersession<br />\n<br />\nDElkuuts liEAd<br />\nSouTh FOR GloRy<br />\n<br />\ninvoluntary mini-session. Sources report that some faculty<br />\nmembers feared they would be obliged to teach<br />\nintersession courses, although they receive no additional<br />\npay to teach during intersession. Steinberg said the<br />\nStudent Council \"won't push as hard\" in the issue in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nMeanwhile, Provost Richard P. Longaker announced<br />\n<br />\nyesterday that the...final form of the calendar change<br />\nshould be printed in the April 24 issue of the Gazette,<br />\npending approval by the Board of Trustees on April<br />\n18,<br />\nand the Council of Deans, this Friday. The<br />\nProvost<br />\ndeclined to give details of the 1978-79 calendar<br />\nbut said,<br />\n\"Th final product does show signs of substant<br />\nial input<br />\nfrom the various divisions.\"<br />\n-M. Krug<br />\n<br />\nIARRy FRELOW<br />\nTwo major changes affecting the Housing Office, the<br />\ndeparture of Housing Director Larry Frelow and a new<br />\nsystem for allocating university-owned housing, were<br />\nannounced last week.<br />\nAccording to Dean of Students Jakie Hall, Frelow<br />\ngoing back to school, and before that, wants some time<br />\noff.\" However, anonymous sources have said that Frelow<br />\nwas fired for mismanagement. Frelow was unavailable for<br />\ncomment.<br />\nHis departure occurred in the wake of student<br />\ncomplaints \u2022 on the methods by which university-owned<br />\nhousing units are apportioned. In response to these<br />\ncriticisms, Hall has decided that the university will<br />\nguarantee housing to all first-year graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students beginning with the 1977-78<br />\nacademic year. All other students will be eligible to enter<br />\nthe lottery on an equal lxisis.<br />\nUnder the present allocation procedure, the university<br />\nmaintains seperate buildings for undergraduates and<br />\ngraduates.

STEVENS:<br />\nSWEATS1110p<br />\nof ThE 70's<br />\n\"After 37 years of loyal and faithful service, I have a<br />\nplaque, $1,360, and brown lung.\" --Thomas Malone, a<br />\nretired Stevens worker<br />\nJ.P. Stevens and Co. began as a small family-owned<br />\ntextile manufacturer in Massachusetts in 1813. Since<br />\nWorld War II, it has merged with 10 companies, becoming<br />\nthe second largest corporate giant in the textile industry,<br />\nand the nation's no. 1 labor law violator.<br />\nIn their drive to avoid unionization, J.P. Stevens has<br />\nestablished a policy of closing Northeastern plants and<br />\nmoving south. The reasons for this are clear: traditionally<br />\nthe south has been the country's most hostile region<br />\ntowards industrial unionization. So-called \"Right to<br />\nWork\" laws, racial antagonism, and depressed local<br />\neconomies<br />\nhave combined to stifle attempts to<br />\nunionize Southern workers. Taking advantage of this<br />\nsituation, Stevens has closed all but five small northern<br />\nplants and now operates 80 plants in southern states.<br />\nStevens relocated its textile mills in Dixie for one<br />\nessential reason: to make more profit at the expense of<br />\ntheir workers. The record indicates they have succeeded.<br />\nIn wages alone, the Stevens worker receives 31% less than<br />\nthe average American factory worker. This disparity is<br />\nmagnified by fringe benefits and working conditions so<br />\nprimitive that even Andrew Carnegie would smile.<br />\nThe J.P. Stevens pension system makes it possible to<br />\nwork for the company for 47 years and receive the<br />\ngenerous sum of $60 a month upon retirement. In health<br />\ncare, J.P. Stevens has pioneered such practices as ordering<br />\n<br />\nan electrocuted worker out of a hospital intensive care<br />\nunit and back to work in order to avoid increasing their<br />\nworker-compensation liability.<br />\nIf any group of workers has ever needed an adequate<br />\nhealth-care plan, it is those at J.P. Stevens. The<br />\nCompany's mills have frequently been cited for<br />\ndangerously exposed saw blades, steam pipes, fan belts,<br />\netc. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration<br />\n(OSHA) has found cotton dust levels in some Stevens<br />\nplants to be three times the maximum allowed tinder<br />\ntedefal standards. The result is, as many as one in three of<br />\nthe exposed workers are likely to develop a disabling<br />\nrespiratory disease called \"brown lung.\" According to an<br />\nOSHA investigation, the seven Stevens plants in Roanoke<br />\nRapids, N.C. have noise levels over 20 times in excess of<br />\nthose prescribed by law. Consequently, scientists predict<br />\nthat almost half of the workers in these plants will suffer<br />\nsevere hearing loss by the time they retire.<br />\nProblems with wages, benefits and working conditions<br />\nare especially acute for the 20% of the Stevens work force<br />\nthat is black. Twice Federal Courts have ruled the<br />\ncompany in violation of laws against employment<br />\ndiscrimination. In December 1975, a U.S. District Court<br />\nruled that the company management in Roanoke Rapids<br />\nhad, since 1969, engaged in a series of discriminatory<br />\npractices including: 1) hiring on the basis of race; 2)<br />\nreserving clerical and supervisory jobs for white<br />\nemployees; 3) discrimination against blacks in layoffs and<br />\nrecalls; 4) paying blacks substantially lower wages than<br />\nwhites.<br />\nA single worker cannot hope to effectively alter the<br />\npolicies of a large corporation like J.P. Stevens. They<br />\nsimply lack the necessary economic and political leverage.<br />\nThe alternative, of course, is for the workers to unionize<br />\nso that they may deal with management on a more<br />\nequitable basis. An increasing number of Stevens<br />\nemployees have recognized this and have opted for union<br />\nrepresentation.<br />\nFederal law guarantees industrial workers the right to<br />\nfreely vote on union membership. If a majority of the<br />\nworkers at a plant favor union representation, the<br />\ncompany is required to negotiate \"in good faith\" with the<br />\nunion. The agency with jurisdiction to enforce the<br />\nFederal labor laws is the National Labor Relations Board<br />\n(NLRB). Since 1963, the NLRB has brought 16 cases<br />\nagainst J.P. Stevens in the Federal Courts and the<br />\ncompany has been found guilty 14 times. Through these<br />\nsuits, 125 workers dismissed for union activities have been<br />\n<br />\nreinstated, regaining $1.3 million in back pay.<br />\nFiring is not the only weapon in Stevens' anti-union<br />\narsenal. The NLRB and the courts have found the<br />\ncompany guilty, time after time of 1) coercive<br />\ninterrogation of workers; 2) surveillance of suspected<br />\nunion activists, both on and off company property; 3)<br />\ndenying overtime to union supporters; 4)discriminatorily.<br />\napplying plant rules.<br />\nOne of the company's favorite tactics is to threaten<br />\nclosure of a plant if the workers attempt to unionize.<br />\nMost of the Stevens plants are located in small towns<br />\nwhere jobs are scarce, and such threats are a powerful<br />\nmeans of intimidation. In fact, Stevens completely closed<br />\ndown its Statesboror, Ga. plant in 1975, rather than obey<br />\na U.S. Court of Appeals order to negotiate with the<br />\nunion.<br />\nThe most prominent current example of J.P. Stevens'<br />\ncontempt for the law is at the plants in Roanoke Rapids.<br />\nThere, in 1974, the union won an election among the<br />\nworkers, but since that time, the NLRB regional director<br />\nhas found that the company \"negotiated with the Union<br />\nin bad faith and with no intent of entering into any final<br />\nor binding collective bargaining agreement.\" Once again,<br />\nthe company is being taken to court for violating the<br />\nnation's labor laws.<br />\nAfter 15 years of litigation, is has become clear that the<br />\ncourts alone cannot effectively force J.P. Stevens to<br />\nrespect the rights of its workers. At this point, the most<br />\neffective method of bringing J.P. Stevens to its senses is a<br />\nswift kick in its pocketbook. This past January, a<br />\naationwide boycott of J.P. Stevens products was begun.<br />\nThe AFL-CIO has committed $15 million over the next<br />\n10 years in support of the boycott. In addition to labor<br />\nunions, numerous religious, political and civil rights<br />\ngroups are promoting the boycott.<br />\nThe boycott will not be easy. Stevens products'are sold<br />\nunder a score of different brand names such as: Utica<br />\nsheets, towels and blankets, Tastemaker sheets, towels and<br />\ncarpets, Peanuts (the cartoon) sheets, Gulistan carpets,<br />\nand Yves St. Laurent sheets. And the boycott will not<br />\nrequire a great sacrifice on the part of consumers. There<br />\nare plenty of other brands of sheets, towels and carpets.<br />\nJust make the small effort necessary to learn the Stevens<br />\nbrands, don't buy them, and urge your family and friends<br />\nto do the same.<br />\nThe implications of this boycott are extraordinary. Not<br />\nonly can the boycott bring justice to thousands of Stevens<br />\nworkers, but if it is effective, it can be the key to the<br />\nunionization of hundreds of thousa.nds of industrial<br />\nworkers throughout the South.<br />\nSubmitted by The Young Democrats<br />\n<br />\nAN OPEN LETTER TO PRESidENT<br />\nDear Dr. Muller,<br />\ntypical of this University.

Hopkins plays Cornell this weekend.<br />\nThe Blue Jays (now 5-0) erupted for seven first period<br />\ngoals en route to a 10-2 halftime lead, and then coasted<br />\nthrough the second half as the fourth-ranked visitors<br />\ntroed to recpver.<br />\nHopkins's first-half explosion was surprising in light of<br />\nthe style of play exhibited so far this season by the<br />\nHomewood ten. In previous contests, JHU has been<br />\nsluggish through the first half, before coming on strongly<br />\nin the third and fourth quarters of play.<br />\n\"We were just ready to play today,\" said Hopkins head<br />\ncoach Henry Ciccarone.<br />\nWas the Coach surprised at the relative ease with which<br />\ntL\u2022 Jays handled the previously undefeated Wahoos?<br />\n\"Yes, I was,\" Ciccarone replied. \"I expected a real<br />\ndogfight.\"<br />\nThe Jays came out roaring from the opening face-off<br />\nand never looked back. Freshman Frank Cutrone got the<br />\ngame's first goal less than one minute into the contest<br />\nwhen he took a Rich Hirsch pass and gunned the ball past<br />\nthe Cavalier goalie.<br />\nAlthough the score remained 1-0 over the next five<br />\nminutes, Hopkins began to assert itself. Play was<br />\ncontinually in the Virginia defensive zone.<br />\nAt the 5:38 mark, the roof began to fall in for the<br />\nvisitors to Homewood. Within two and one-half minutes,<br />\nthe Hays had pumped five goals past the beleaguered<br />\nWahoo net minder and suddenly held a 6-0 lead.<br />\n<br />\nJay midfielder Dave Huntley opened the barrage when<br />\nhe connected on a fifteen-foot shot while JHU held an<br />\nextra-man advantage. Bob DeSimone, Huntley, Tom<br />\nMyrick and Hirsch followed in quick succession to give<br />\nHopkins its awesome lead. Cutrone tallied his second<br />\nscore of the period several minutes late and JHU held a<br />\n7-0 advantage after fifteen minutes of play.<br />\nFreshman Wayne Davis opened the second period<br />\nscoring with a twelve-footer. Virginia, after having been<br />\nshut out for twenty minutes, finally broke into the<br />\nscoring column,\"cutting\" the lead to 8-1.<br />\nThe teams traded goals through the rest of the quarter<br />\nwith Mike O'Neill and Myrick adding Blue Jay scores to<br />\nbring on the 10-2 halftime margin.<br />\nVirginia fought valiantly throughout the second half to<br />\ntry and get back into the game, but unsuccessfully.<br />\nAlthough they outplayed the Jays for most of the half,<br />\nthe visitors were unable to close the gap.<br />\n<br />\nCapitalizing on an effective man-advantage offense, the<br />\nWahoos outscored the Jays 6-3 in the third quarter and<br />\ntrailed 13-8 as the final fifteen minutes began. Virginia<br />\nthen added a goal midway through the fourth quarter to<br />\nclose to within four goals, and it appeared as though the<br />\nCavaliers were gaining the momentum.<br />\nHowever, faster than you can say Eamon McEneaney,<br />\nHuntley and Cutrone fired home goals and the Hopkins<br />\nunblemished record was to remain intact.<br />\n\"We decided to reverse our pattern this week,\"<br />\nCiccarone said following the game. \"Maybe when we got<br />\nahead, it's human nature to let down. Anyway, there's no<br />\nquestion that the first half was the best thirty minutes of<br />\nlacrosse we've played this season.\"<br />\nThe Jays will have to play equally well for the entire<br />\nsixty minutes if they hope to keep their undefeated<br />\nseason intact next Saturday when they travel to Ithaca.<br />\nNew York to face the Big Red of Cornell.<br />\n<br />\nHIARdhirTiNg diAmoNdmEN dEmolish HAvERfoRd<br />\nBy AL DANIELS<br />\nPegged Coach Denny Cox's new juggernaut by a local<br />\nsportcaster, the Hopkins baseball team started out this<br />\nseason to prove that statement and now find themselves<br />\nundefeated in league play and 5-3 overall.<br />\nOpening the season the Thursday before spring break,<br />\nHopkins' baseball Blue Jays swept Division II Mt. St.<br />\nMary's, 3-2 and 5-4. Despite a wind chill factor below<br />\nfreezing, a combination of defense, timely hitting from<br />\nDennis Holt, and excellent pitching from Steffan \"Three<br />\nFinger\" Burns and Mike Santo made the games real crowd<br />\npleasers for the six or so in attendance.<br />\nA doubleheader March 26 found Hopkins demolishing<br />\nMAC rival Haverford, 5-0 and 15-6. The first game,<br />\npitched and won by freshman Parreira, was over when the<br />\nthird batter, Dave Emala, stepped to the plate in the first<br />\ninning and cracked a home run to center.<br />\nThe second game saw Bob Babb and Dave Lewing<br />\npower the Jays' 15 run attack as Jason Sussman pitched a<br />\ncomplete game victory under no pressure.<br />\nBesides the obvious hitting prowess displayed over the<br />\nweak Haverford team, the Jays also ran rampant over the<br />\nbasepaths led by senior Bob Babb's 5 stolen bases. Coach<br />\nCox credited first baseman Babb for the team's<br />\nbaserunning success in a recent Evening Sun article.<br />\n\"All our players are much more confident and<br />\naggressive on the bases because of him,\" the coach<br />\nexplained. While recovering from a serious knee injury,<br />\nBabb stole 18 bases in 18 attempts last year while<br />\nproviding .390 hitting from his leadoff batting slot.<br />\nOn the Tuesday of spring vacation, Hopkins and a<br />\nprestigious University of Baltimore team took to the Jays'<br />\nfield behind the Snack Bar, this time with a better crowd<br />\non hand. According to a News American article,<br />\n.\"reputation was about the only thing BU had over<br />\nHopkins. The Jays had better hitting, running, and<br />\npitching.\"<br />\nThe game was a slugfest until determined reliever Mike<br />\nSanto came into the game with two outs in the top of the<br />\nfifth and the Blue Jays ahead 7-6. Over the next four and<br />\none-third innings. Santo didn't allow a single hit or run as<br />\nHopkins tallied twice for a 9-6 final score. Hopkins<br />\ncollected a dozen hits led by Chuck Ingber and Babb, who<br />\nhit two run producing shots.<br />\n<br />\nUp until this game the Jays have had phenomenal .500<br />\nhitting from Dave Emala, who provides leadership<br />\nthrough performance with fellow co-captain Bob Babb,<br />\nand timely hitting and dependable defense from Dave<br />\nLewing and his crew in the outfield, including Mike April,<br />\nIngber, and Greg Jenkins.<br />\nThe successful pitching staff has been able to get the<br />\nball over the plate consistently and cleverly, while their<br />\ndefense was matched by dependable performances from<br />\nthe regulars.<br />\nThe broke down, however, as the Jays had a<br />\nleddown This broke down, however, as the Jays had a<br />\nletdown playing Western Maryland March 7th on a<br />\nsometimes snowbound field. Mike Santo, who had earned<br />\nhis first starting assignment, lost his control and gave up<br />\nthe middle two runs on wild throwing. Although the score<br />\nwas tied 2-2 as late as the fifth inning, the Jays lost a 6-3<br />\n<br />\ndecision to the weather, but most of all; to themselves.<br />\nWhile WM was scoring, Hopkins was stranding men on<br />\nbase. The team could not capitalize on three hits by<br />\nleftfielder Lewing and 8 stolen bases by the team. On<br />\nthree different occasions, two men were left stranded<br />\nwith the same batter at the plate.<br />\nThis past Saturday, the Blue Jays dropped a<br />\ndoubleheader to crosstown rival UMBC. Playing on the<br />\nRetrivers' small wind-swept field, JHU fell 11-9 and 7-4.<br />\nThe Jays swing back into action tomorrow afternoon in<br />\nwhat may be their most important contest of the season.<br />\nMAC-rival Widener College invades Homewood for a<br />\ndoubleheader beginning at 1:00 pm on the baseball field<br />\n(located directly behind the New Dorms).<br />\nWidener won the MAC title a year ago and if the Jays<br />\nhope to capture the flag this time around, victories<br />\ntomorrow are imperative.<br />\n<br />\nTRACkMEN dASIII TO EARL)<br />\n,SUCCESS<br />\nBy BRUCE FOX<br />\nThe track season is underway and the MAC had better<br />\nwatch out for the Be e Jays. The addition of a pool of<br />\nfreshmen and a revitalization of team spirit promises to<br />\nmake the Hopkins men contenders in what has become a<br />\nvery strong conference.<br />\nThe Jays opened their season with a bang against<br />\nSwarthmore and Franklin 'and Marshall. Losing to F and<br />\nM, a track powerhouse, the men soundly defeated their<br />\nrivals from Swarthmore.<br />\nPerformances to be noted include those of Al McLin<br />\nand John Coad in the one hundred yard dash. McLin, a<br />\nfreshman out of Hanover, Pa., comes to Hopkins with<br />\nimpressive high school statistics. His second place finish<br />\nwith a time of 10.3 insures that we will be strong in the<br />\nsprints for at least for four years.<br />\nCoad seriously begins his sprinting career this season<br />\nafter being plagued by injuries the past two years. The<br />\ndash is not his only strength, however, as he also own the<br />\nschool shot put record which he set last season, breaking a<br />\nrecord that had stood for 50 years.<br />\nThe distances seemed to be covered by the Jays equally<br />\nwell and are led by personable senior Jim Kennedy. The<br />\nthree mile is one of the most grueling of all events and<br />\n<br />\nJim started off the season by shattering the school record,<br />\nfinishing at 15:01.1.<br />\nSophomore Bob Freamon was right behind and went<br />\non to win the mile run. Bob holds the school record in the<br />\nmile and big things are looked for from him in the future.<br />\nThere is not much one can say about Rick Nelson<br />\nexcept that he has become Mr. Consistency for the Blue<br />\nJays. His high jump and pole vault abilities are the best to<br />\nbe seen at Hopkins in year.<br />\nAnother performer worth noting is Bob Oates jwho<br />\ndoubles in both the 440 yard run and the mile relay. His<br />\nversatility shines through when another man is needed in<br />\nthe 220 yard dash. Here he is joined by Andy Hollis, a<br />\nsophomore who opened the season with an impressive<br />\nsecond place finish.<br />\nRounding out the Hopkins attack is Bob Alworth in<br />\nthe 880 who is coming off an injury which kept him out<br />\nof last year's championships. Co-captains Craig Snyder in<br />\nthe 440 and mile relay, and Bruce Baillie in the triple<br />\njump hope to lead Hopkins to another in a long string of<br />\nwinning seasons.<br />\nRandy Cockey, in his second year as head coach, has<br />\nmolded the team to a strong unit in search of an MAC<br />\nchampionship.<br />\n<br />\n\u2018,.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "LACROSSE FEVER!!!<br />\nSpRiNgliME COMES<br />\nTO Homewood<br /><br />\n-1<br />\nEWS ETTE<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\n/<br />\n4<br /><br />\nvol. lixxi no. 44/tuesday, april 12, 1977/baltimore, maryland/81st year<br /><br />\n\"Homecoming Day in the spring?\" my old high school buddy roared with<br />\nlaughter. \"What's the matter, don't you guys know that football is the big<br />\ncollegiate sport?

Unless you hail from Long<br />\nIsland or Baltimore you are probably unfamiliar with the great ol' Indian<br />\ngame and its mystique. Lacrosse is as much of an institution at Hopkins as<br />\nthe hospital or the med school. The tradition is practically as old as the<br />\nUniversity itself, going back into the mid-1880s when Hopkins was one of<br />\nthe first schools to start playing lacrosse. The sport took hold in Bawlamer<br />\nand that nurtured the sport at Hopkins and kept it growing. The tradition<br />\nwas enhanced when the University's team representedthe United States in<br />\nthe only two Olympic games in which lacrosse was included -- 1928 and<br />\n1932.<br />\nLacrosse is the coming out season at Hopkins. People you've never seen<br />\nbefore and never will see again will be in attendance opening day against<br />\nYale arrl 'every home every home game thereafter. Lacrosse has even been<br />\nknown to draw out the nerdiest of nerds from the bowels of D level (albeit<br />\nfor only the first half!) Lacrosse brings Hopkins recognition the likes of<br />\nwhich few other University activities can equal. The cover of Sports<br />\nIllustrated was once adorned with the \"spring thing\" at Homewood.<br />\nLacrosse is the Great<br />\nEqualizer. While other sports may suffer their ups and downs, the lean years<br />\nare few and far between for \"the fastest game on foot\". While other Blue Jay<br />\nsquads struggle on a level with the Haverfords and Swarthmores,<br />\nMontclair States, Galludets etc. lacrosse allows Hopkins rooters the luxury of<br />\ncompeting with the Marylands, Navys and Virginias on equal footing while<br />\nstanding far above the normal shrines of collegiate sports, be it Ohio State,<br />\nUCLA, Penn State et al.<br />\nLacrosse is the elixir of youth which draws former Blue Jays back to the<br />\nnest to be revitalized and lets them relive the old glorious days of ought-two<br />\n\"when we did things we ought not too, hch, heh, Harry!\" It brings<br />\nobscenities and threats of violence to the lips of even the meekest-looking<br />\nseptogenarian. \"One hundred, and eight, one hundred and nine, one hundred<br />\nand ten, WE WANT MORE!\"<br />\nLacrosse brings Hopkins fans down to the blue-collar, beer guzzling,<br />\nreferee-baiting level of all other sports fans. Philosophy and physics majors<br />\nside by side descend from the ivory tower to share an illogical but yet<br />\nirrefutable hatred of the University of Maryland; a hatred which elevates<br />\nTerrapin standouts to levels of infamy usually reserved for the archvillains of<br />\nmankind.<br />\nLacrosse brings more people to a small urban university for a game with<br />\nVirginia than to the second game of the major league baseball season being<br />\nplayed just blocks away.<br />\nLacrosse even causes major college newspapers tb run sports phao essays<br />\non page one.<br />\nLacrosse: WE WANT MORE!<br />\n----Steve Levin<br /><br />\nINSIDE THIS ISSUE<br />\nTwo pAqIES Of Op-Ed<br />\npqs.4,5<br />\nMOTIIER WAS A CO-Ed<br />\np.,<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/april 12. 1977<br />\nChester's Place and the Writing<br />\nSeminars will offer a delicious evening<br />\nof live music this Wednesday evening<br />\nfrom 7:30 PM until 12:30.

What's she doing here? Isn't Hopkins an<br />\nall-boy's school?\"<br />\nNot anymore, a passing wag might have commented<br />\nback in the fall of 1970 when, as part of a new co-ed<br />\nPolicy, 94 female transfer students were admitted to<br />\nHopkins. Previously the only women admitted were grad<br />\nstudents or some undergrads as \"special students.\"<br />\nThe reaction to these first female pioneers at Hopkins<br />\nwas strangely mixed. There seemed to be a mystique as to<br />\nwhat an actual woman student was. Some professors<br />\nactually believed the presence of women was to act as a<br />\nkind of \"civilizing influence\" in the classroom<br />\nIn an effort to clarify misconceptions and raise public<br />\nconsciousness of women's role in the academic<br />\ncommunity, the M. Carey Thomas Women's Center was<br />\ncreated. The center's members worked toward the<br />\nacceptance of women on campus and helped women in<br />\ntheir efforts to adjust to their new surroundings.<br />\nThese first efforts focused on basic issues such as the<br />\nestablishment of health facilities for women, and in '73<br />\nsponsored a festival, \"Next Step,\" which showed the<br />\npositive outgrowths of women's ambitions.<br />\nSince that time, the Women's Center has lost<br />\nmomentum because many of its members have graduated<br />\nand women, at large, have become a more integrated part<br />\nof the Hopkins community. Today, there are 607<br />\nundergraduate female students at Hopkins. Their interests<br />\nrange from the Humanities to the Natural Sciences<br />\n(Natural Sciences being, of course, the largest area of<br />\nenrollment) with full participation in the college<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\nThe question still remains, however, as to what women<br />\nare all about, what their role is in an academic setting, and<br />\nwhat it conceivably should be. In response to these<br />\nquestions, a women's committee was informally<br />\nestablished a year and a half ago to discuss the idea of<br />\nwomen's programs at Hopkins. The group is composed of<br /><br />\nmale and female faculty members, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students, who are concerned about<br />\nwomen's existence at Hopkins.<br />\nAs a result of their concern, several courses have been<br />\noffered that are specifically geared to women as subject<br />\nmatter and to women's influence through the feminist<br />\nmovement. Until this point, women's courses had been<br />\noffered on an irregular basis. In the spring of'71, the first<br />\nwomen's course was offered, but not given for credit.<br />\nSubsequent courses have been offered for credit but not<br />\nthrough any kind of organized movement.<br />\nThe philosophy behind the present group bases on the<br />\ndevelopment of an ongoing core of courses to be offered<br />\non a regular basis. According to Donna Haroway, a<br />\nprofessor in the History of Science Department, these<br />\ncourses will take \"an eclectic point of view and touch on<br />\nmany different concerns.\" Examples of this are issues<br />\ntouching on political theory, art, politics, and basic<br />\nprimate behavior.<br />\nThe four courses offered this year by the women's<br />\nstudies group have had overwhelming student response<br />\nwith an exceptionally large student turn-out. The specific<br /><br />\ncourses offered are: Sexuality and Politics, Women and<br />\nArt, Women and Politics, and Sex, Dominance, and<br />\nAggression. These courses all differ in their approaches.<br />\nFor instance, Sexuality and Politics, taught by Dr. John<br />\nPocock from the History Department, and Nancy<br />\nHartsock, a Political Science professor and editor of the<br />\nfeminist quarterly, Quest concentrates on myths and<br />\nsymbols while Donna Harroway's course focuses on<br />\n\"research used in social and political situations.\"<br />\nNext year, courses offered will include one by Dr. Ron<br />\nWalters of the History Department, called \"Social and<br />\nCultural History of the U.S.\" which will include a section<br />\non the anglo-american family. Other tentative courses will<br />\ncome from the Near Eastern, Classics, and Anthropology<br />\ndepartments.<br />\nAccording to the women's studies group, the failure to<br />\ncreate a women's studies department has been because of<br />\nan effort to bring women's studies into the mainstream of<br />\nacademic disciplines and not regard women as separate<br />\nentities. To this extent, women are seen to be important<br />\nin many areas of academic study. Their inclusion within<br />\nthese areas is equally important.,<br />\nI -M. Davis<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nDEfERREd ilUdgMENT ASSURES CREalTEu INTERSESSION<br />\nHopkins students will apparently be able to participate<br />\nin a credited intersession next January. Many advocates of<br />\na credited intersession had feared that a March 15 vote by<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate Studies, recommending<br />\nto the Academic Council that credit for intersession be<br />\nabolished, would doom credit for the voluntary academic<br />\nactivity.<br />\nHowever, the status of intersession received a boost<br />\nwhen the Academic Council motioned to defer judgment<br />\non the issue during their March 23 session. Sigmund<br />\nSuskind, Dean of Undergraduate and Graduate Studies<br />\nand head of CUS, an advisory body to AC, said the issue<br />\nwas<br />\ndeferred<br />\n\"until they get all the facts and<br />\nevaluate the intersession question.\" Unless the AC takes<br />\naction before the end of the year, intersession will retain<br />\nits present 4-1-4 format.<br />\nIf the AC does discuss the issue, it could modify the<br />\nprocedure for the delegation of credit. One idea is to tie<br />\nintersession credits to independent study, with a six-credit<br />\nmaximum per year, said Mark Steinberg, member of the<br />\nStudent Council's Committee on Education. This<br />\ncommittee prepared an<br /><br />\nreport which advocated an expanded 4-1-4<br />\nintersession. Neither Deans Suskind or Owen, President<br />\nMuller, or Provost Lonaker take a stand on the<br />\nintersession issue, preferring the Academic Council to<br />\nmake its final decision.<br />\n'I think the issue is pretty much dead for this academic<br />\nyear,\" Steinberg said. \"Many people misconstrued what<br />\nwe (intersession advocates and liasons) were trying to do.<br />\nWe were just .attempting to maintain the same level of<br />\nParticipation and the number of course offerings.\"<br />\nHowever, many faculty members interpreted student<br />\npressure for an expanded intersession as a proposal for<br />\nan<br />\nintersession<br /><br />\nDElkuuts liEAd<br />\nSouTh FOR GloRy<br /><br />\ninvoluntary mini-session. Sources report that some faculty<br />\nmembers feared they would be obliged to teach<br />\nintersession courses, although they receive no additional<br />\npay to teach during intersession. Steinberg said the<br />\nStudent Council \"won't push as hard\" in the issue in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nMeanwhile, Provost Richard P. Longaker announced<br /><br />\nyesterday that the...final form of the calendar change<br />\nshould be printed in the April 24 issue of the Gazette,<br />\npending approval by the Board of Trustees on April<br />\n18,<br />\nand the Council of Deans, this Friday. The<br />\nProvost<br />\ndeclined to give details of the 1978-79 calendar<br />\nbut said,<br />\n\"Th final product does show signs of substant<br />\nial input<br />\nfrom the various divisions.\"<br />\n-M. Krug<br /><br />\nIARRy FRELOW<br />\nTwo major changes affecting the Housing Office, the<br />\ndeparture of Housing Director Larry Frelow and a new<br />\nsystem for allocating university-owned housing, were<br />\nannounced last week.<br />\nAccording to Dean of Students Jakie Hall, Frelow<br />\ngoing back to school, and before that, wants some time<br />\noff.\" However, anonymous sources have said that Frelow<br />\nwas fired for mismanagement. Frelow was unavailable for<br />\ncomment.<br />\nHis departure occurred in the wake of student<br />\ncomplaints \u2022 on the methods by which university-owned<br />\nhousing units are apportioned. In response to these<br />\ncriticisms, Hall has decided that the university will<br />\nguarantee housing to all first-year graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students beginning with the 1977-78<br />\nacademic year. All other students will be eligible to enter<br />\nthe lottery on an equal lxisis.<br />\nUnder the present allocation procedure, the university<br />\nmaintains seperate buildings for undergraduates and<br />\ngraduates.

Besides the problems of adjusting to a<br />\nnew city<br />\nand school, transfer students have added<br />\nacademic<br />\npressures which freshmen do not encounter during<br />\ntheir<br />\nfirst, pass-fail semester.<br />\nOne of the main problems in implementing<br />\nhousing<br />\npolicies is the fluctuation in student demands.<br />\n\"Prior to<br />\nthe last few years, most students wanted to<br />\nlive in the<br />\ncommunity. This happened not only at Hopkins,<br />\nbut at<br />\nmany other colleges,\" Hall said. \"With the new<br />\nsocial life<br />\nin recent years, more people have wanted to<br />\ncome back to<br />\ncampus living.\"<br />\nBefore the advent of the current lottery<br />\nsystem,<br />\nfemales were given priority in obtainin<br />\ng university<br />\nhousing for security reasons, as were blacks<br />\nand foreign<br />\nstudents to counter prejudices.of area<br />\nlandlords.

Stevens and Co. began as a small family-owned<br />\ntextile manufacturer in Massachusetts in 1813. Since<br />\nWorld War II, it has merged with 10 companies, becoming<br />\nthe second largest corporate giant in the textile industry,<br />\nand the nation's no. 1 labor law violator.<br />\nIn their drive to avoid unionization, J.P. Stevens has<br />\nestablished a policy of closing Northeastern plants and<br />\nmoving south. The reasons for this are clear: traditionally<br />\nthe south has been the country's most hostile region<br />\ntowards industrial unionization. So-called \"Right to<br />\nWork\" laws, racial antagonism, and depressed local<br />\neconomies<br />\nhave combined to stifle attempts to<br />\nunionize Southern workers. Taking advantage of this<br />\nsituation, Stevens has closed all but five small northern<br />\nplants and now operates 80 plants in southern states.<br />\nStevens relocated its textile mills in Dixie for one<br />\nessential reason: to make more profit at the expense of<br />\ntheir workers. The record indicates they have succeeded.<br />\nIn wages alone, the Stevens worker receives 31% less than<br />\nthe average American factory worker. This disparity is<br />\nmagnified by fringe benefits and working conditions so<br />\nprimitive that even Andrew Carnegie would smile.<br />\nThe J.P. Stevens pension system makes it possible to<br />\nwork for the company for 47 years and receive the<br />\ngenerous sum of $60 a month upon retirement. In health<br />\ncare, J.P. Stevens has pioneered such practices as ordering<br /><br />\nan electrocuted worker out of a hospital intensive care<br />\nunit and back to work in order to avoid increasing their<br />\nworker-compensation liability.<br />\nIf any group of workers has ever needed an adequate<br />\nhealth-care plan, it is those at J.P. Stevens. The<br />\nCompany's mills have frequently been cited for<br />\ndangerously exposed saw blades, steam pipes, fan belts,<br />\netc. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration<br />\n(OSHA) has found cotton dust levels in some Stevens<br />\nplants to be three times the maximum allowed tinder<br />\ntedefal standards. The result is, as many as one in three of<br />\nthe exposed workers are likely to develop a disabling<br />\nrespiratory disease called \"brown lung.\" According to an<br />\nOSHA investigation, the seven Stevens plants in Roanoke<br />\nRapids, N.C. have noise levels over 20 times in excess of<br />\nthose prescribed by law. Consequently, scientists predict<br />\nthat almost half of the workers in these plants will suffer<br />\nsevere hearing loss by the time they retire.<br />\nProblems with wages, benefits and working conditions<br />\nare especially acute for the 20% of the Stevens work force<br />\nthat is black. Twice Federal Courts have ruled the<br />\ncompany in violation of laws against employment<br />\ndiscrimination. In December 1975, a U.S. District Court<br />\nruled that the company management in Roanoke Rapids<br />\nhad, since 1969, engaged in a series of discriminatory<br />\npractices including: 1) hiring on the basis of race; 2)<br />\nreserving clerical and supervisory jobs for white<br />\nemployees; 3) discrimination against blacks in layoffs and<br />\nrecalls; 4) paying blacks substantially lower wages than<br />\nwhites.<br />\nA single worker cannot hope to effectively alter the<br />\npolicies of a large corporation like J.P. Stevens. They<br />\nsimply lack the necessary economic and political leverage.<br />\nThe alternative, of course, is for the workers to unionize<br />\nso that they may deal with management on a more<br />\nequitable basis. An increasing number of Stevens<br />\nemployees have recognized this and have opted for union<br />\nrepresentation.<br />\nFederal law guarantees industrial workers the right to<br />\nfreely vote on union membership. If a majority of the<br />\nworkers at a plant favor union representation, the<br />\ncompany is required to negotiate \"in good faith\" with the<br />\nunion. The agency with jurisdiction to enforce the<br />\nFederal labor laws is the National Labor Relations Board<br />\n(NLRB). Since 1963, the NLRB has brought 16 cases<br />\nagainst J.P. Stevens in the Federal Courts and the<br />\ncompany has been found guilty 14 times. Through these<br />\nsuits, 125 workers dismissed for union activities have been<br /><br />\nreinstated, regaining $1.3 million in back pay.<br />\nFiring is not the only weapon in Stevens' anti-union<br />\narsenal. The NLRB and the courts have found the<br />\ncompany guilty, time after time of 1) coercive<br />\ninterrogation of workers; 2) surveillance of suspected<br />\nunion activists, both on and off company property; 3)<br />\ndenying overtime to union supporters; 4)discriminatorily.<br />\napplying plant rules.<br />\nOne of the company's favorite tactics is to threaten<br />\nclosure of a plant if the workers attempt to unionize.<br />\nMost of the Stevens plants are located in small towns<br />\nwhere jobs are scarce, and such threats are a powerful<br />\nmeans of intimidation. In fact, Stevens completely closed<br />\ndown its Statesboror, Ga. plant in 1975, rather than obey<br />\na U.S. Court of Appeals order to negotiate with the<br />\nunion.<br />\nThe most prominent current example of J.P. Stevens'<br />\ncontempt for the law is at the plants in Roanoke Rapids.<br />\nThere, in 1974, the union won an election among the<br />\nworkers, but since that time, the NLRB regional director<br />\nhas found that the company \"negotiated with the Union<br />\nin bad faith and with no intent of entering into any final<br />\nor binding collective bargaining agreement.\" Once again,<br />\nthe company is being taken to court for violating the<br />\nnation's labor laws.<br />\nAfter 15 years of litigation, is has become clear that the<br />\ncourts alone cannot effectively force J.P. Stevens to<br />\nrespect the rights of its workers. At this point, the most<br />\neffective method of bringing J.P. Stevens to its senses is a<br />\nswift kick in its pocketbook. This past January, a<br />\naationwide boycott of J.P. Stevens products was begun.<br />\nThe AFL-CIO has committed $15 million over the next<br />\n10 years in support of the boycott. In addition to labor<br />\nunions, numerous religious, political and civil rights<br />\ngroups are promoting the boycott.<br />\nThe boycott will not be easy. Stevens products'are sold<br />\nunder a score of different brand names such as: Utica<br />\nsheets, towels and blankets, Tastemaker sheets, towels and<br />\ncarpets, Peanuts (the cartoon) sheets, Gulistan carpets,<br />\nand Yves St. Laurent sheets. And the boycott will not<br />\nrequire a great sacrifice on the part of consumers. There<br />\nare plenty of other brands of sheets, towels and carpets.<br />\nJust make the small effort necessary to learn the Stevens<br />\nbrands, don't buy them, and urge your family and friends<br />\nto do the same.<br />\nThe implications of this boycott are extraordinary. Not<br />\nonly can the boycott bring justice to thousands of Stevens<br />\nworkers, but if it is effective, it can be the key to the<br />\nunionization of hundreds of thousa.nds of industrial<br />\nworkers throughout the South.<br />\nSubmitted by The Young Democrats<br /><br />\nAN OPEN LETTER TO PRESidENT<br />\nDear Dr. Muller,<br />\ntypical of this University.

The<br />\nthree mile is one of the most grueling of all events and<br /><br />\nJim started off the season by shattering the school record,<br />\nfinishing at 15:01.1.<br />\nSophomore Bob Freamon was right behind and went<br />\non to win the mile run. Bob holds the school record in the<br />\nmile and big things are looked for from him in the future.<br />\nThere is not much one can say about Rick Nelson<br />\nexcept that he has become Mr. Consistency for the Blue<br />\nJays. His high jump and pole vault abilities are the best to<br />\nbe seen at Hopkins in year.<br />\nAnother performer worth noting is Bob Oates jwho<br />\ndoubles in both the 440 yard run and the mile relay. His<br />\nversatility shines through when another man is needed in<br />\nthe 220 yard dash. Here he is joined by Andy Hollis, a<br />\nsophomore who opened the season with an impressive<br />\nsecond place finish.<br />\nRounding out the Hopkins attack is Bob Alworth in<br />\nthe 880 who is coming off an injury which kept him out<br />\nof last year's championships. Co-captains Craig Snyder in<br />\nthe 440 and mile relay, and Bruce Baillie in the triple<br />\njump hope to lead Hopkins to another in a long string of<br />\nwinning seasons.<br />\nRandy Cockey, in his second year as head coach, has<br />\nmolded the team to a strong unit in search of an MAC<br />\nchampionship.<br /><br />\n\u2018,.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 41211, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "70f0df03-9586-4dbb-98a5-c927b213ee24", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14352-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14352, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "931c729b-543f-451c-9387-52168688b929", "url": "/node/14352"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "d1660d48-a45b-4b9e-964a-33fc41219fc6"}]}
