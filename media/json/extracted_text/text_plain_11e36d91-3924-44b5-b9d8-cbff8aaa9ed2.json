Buckler, one of the trustees. During Mr. Buckler's residence<br />\nin Spain, he spent considerable time<br />\nin making a valuable collection of<br />\nthe ancient coins of that country,<br />\nmore than three thousand of which<br />\nhe presented to the University about<br />\na year ago. These coins bear inscriptions in four different languages<br />\n\u2014Latin, Greek, Celtiberian, and<br />\nPhcenician. For lack of a suitable<br />\nplace to deposit them, these coins<br />\nhave been lying in the vaults of the<br />\nTreasurer's office, but this will now<br />\nbe no longer necessary. Two weeks<br />\nago, on his arrival in this country,<br />\nMr. Buckler brought with him six<br />\nbeautiful cabinets of mahogany, similar to those which are used to house<br />\nthe coin collection of the British Museum. These cases have altogether<br />\na capacity of nearly six thousand<br />\ncoins, so that the present needs of the<br />\nUniversity coin collections are provided for.<br />\nThese gifts bring the Johns Hopkins to the first place among the American universities, so far as the collection of ancient coins is concerned. There is only one other American collection of ancient coins of<br />\nSpain which is in any sense comparable with this, namely, the Hispanic<br />\nSociety in New York.<br />\nDINE<br />\nHOPKINS' ALUMNI<br />\nThese cases which have been presented recently may be seen in the<br />\nThe tenth annual reunion and dinner of the class of 1899 of the Johns Latin Seminary Room.<br />\nHopkins University was held Friday<br />\nat the Stafford Hotel.

The<br />\nHonor System exists, naturally, for<br />\nthe benefit of the man who does not<br />\n'cheat, not for the weaker individual.<br />\nYet its workings, in the case of the<br />\ndiscovery of a culprit, are silent,practical, fair in application, and certain<br />\nin results. The center of action of<br />\nsuch a system lies in a committee,<br />\ncomposed of delegates elected by the<br />\ndifferent classes. If a student is accused of cheating\u201e he is brought before the committee, and tried in secret. If found guilty, his name is<br />\nreported by the commiAee to the<br />\nDean, who arranges for the boy to<br />\nflunk out of college at the next examination. All knowledge of the affair is confined to the commitee, the<br />\nmen at the trial, the Dean, and the<br />\nmembers of the faculty who arrange<br />\nto \"flunk out\" the culprit. These men<br />\nare in honor bound to Reep the matter secret, and the boy leaves college<br />\nfree to start over -again somewhere,<br />\nwithout the reputation of a cheat. The<br />\nsystem is as grim and noiseless as<br />\nthe guillotine, but in one way more<br />\nmerciful.<br />\n\\\\There such a system exists, supported by both faculty and students,<br />\nwith absolutely no restraint placed on<br />\na student in examinations, there are<br />\nat first several cases of heartburn and<br />\nsorrow which, however, are far offset<br />\nby the influence on the average student of the very existence and atmosphere of the Honor System around<br />\nhim.<br />\nThe initial point for the introduction of such a system lies, of course,<br />\nin discussion in class meetings.<br />\n<br />\nIn a certain Western college\u2014the<br />\nname of which we for the moment<br />\nforget\u2014the fraternities have united<br />\nin an unusual agreement. This agreement, is that freshmen may only become members of a fraternity upon<br />\npassing the matriculation examinations. This creation proceeds not<br />\nfrom the faculty, but from the stuGLOVES<br />\ndents and is worth a passing glance,<br />\nFOWNES<br />\nif only considered as an attempt from<br />\nolder students to extract better work<br />\nwin Fashion's races<br />\nfrom younger students. Youngsters<br />\n\"hands down\"<br />\nattracted by the allurements of fraternity life sometimes enter college<br />\nrather prematurely, so hampered by<br />\n\"conditions\"that the benefits of college<br />\neducation and surroundings come to<br />\nthem in an unnatural manner. Agreements between fraternities are not<br />\neasy to arrange, but in the case mentioned above it may be said that the<br />\nprospective undergraduate not only<br />\nhas an unusual incentive to industry \"HESSONIAN\"<br />\nA Smart Shoe for college men,<br />\nlaid before him, but also has a not<br />\nAdams Drug Company<br />\nunwise restriction placed upon his with a touch of newness that you'll<br />\nlike.<br />\ncollege course.<br />\nHoward and Monument Streets<br />\nTO BE OBTAINED ONLY AT<br />\nN.

Wood, Professor of Experimental Physics at the<br />\nUniversity, gave a most interesting<br />\nlecture last Wednesday afternoon,before the Hopkins Scientific Associa<br />\ntion.<br />\nThe subject of the lecture,which was<br />\nheld in the physical laboratory, was<br />\n\"Photography by means of invisible<br />\nrays.\"<br />\nDoctor Wood explained that the<br />\ncolors seen in the spectrum were not<br />\nthe only colors into which rays of<br />\nlight were decomposed, but that they<br />\nwere those to which the eye was<br />\nsensible. He said that there are rays<br />\nbeyond the spectrum which could be<br />\nseen by the eye. He explained how<br />\npictures could be taken by means of<br />\nthe ultra violet rays, if the spectrum<br />\nwas made opaque to the sunlight.<br />\nPictures could also be taken by means<br />\nof the infra red rays.<br />\nDoctor Wood presented a number<br />\nof interesting stereopticon views of<br />\nlandscapes, taken by means of the<br />\ninfra red and ultra violet rays. The<br />\ndecided difference between the two<br />\ndifferent types was very remarkable.<br />\nPictures taken by means of the infra red rays gave the appearance of<br />\nsnow scenes. While those taken with<br />\nthe ultra violet rays produced pictures different from normal photographs or those taken with the infra<br />\nred rays.<br />\n<br />\nbe an invariable antecedent. The mirage of the desert presents an appearance of objects reflected in a surface of water. In this case the heated<br />\nearth rarefies the air in the lower<br />\nstrata faster than it can escape, and<br />\nthe flatness of the ground conduces<br />\nto the maintenance of the resulting,<br />\nabnormal distribution of density. Displacement of mirage is commonly<br />\nvertical, but is lateral when the density-gradient is more or less inclined<br />\nto the vertical.\"<br />\nProfessor Wood took this theory up<br />\nin detail, and showed by practical experiment how the mirage appeared.<br />\nThe desert was a long sheet of iron<br />\ncovered with sand, which was given<br />\nthe necessary temperature by means<br />\nof gas burners. The sun was reflected, by means of a mirror, upon a<br />\nlarge sheet of white paper at one<br />\nend of the pseudo-desert, and this<br />\npaper served the additional purpose<br />\nof the sky-line. The sand became<br />\nheated, and to the rapt student, looking at the sand near the paper, it<br />\nappeared as if there was a clear pool<br />\nof crystal water on the iron plate. In<br />\nother words, the solution is this: The<br />\nwaves from the sky-line, which, under ordinary conditions, strike the<br />\nsand and are reflected and absorbed,<br />\n\u2014making us see the sand\u2014are, in<br />\nthis instance, refracted by the greatly expanded air near the surface of<br />\nthe hot sand. Therefore, looking<br />\nahead at some distant point in the<br />\ndesert we seem to see, not the neverending sand, but dancing light waves<br />\ncoming from the clear sky and creating the delicious image of a cool,<br />\nsparkling lake, with its surface slightly rippled by soft zephyrs.<br />\nThe same experiment has been performed before by Professor Wood,<br />\nwho is an expert in this line. Dr.<br />\nWood is a Fellow of the London<br />\nPhysical Society, and an Honorary<br />\nFellow of the Royal Microscopical<br />\nSociety, London.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert W.

The Hopkins number of the Independent has<br />\nbeen awaited with a great deal of<br />\nanticipation, and the praise, criticism and misrepresentation, alas!<br />\nwhich Dr. Slosson judicially deals<br />\nout goes a long way, but hardly fulfills our expectations. But our expectations were, perhaps, too large; our<br />\nknowledge of Hopkins\u2014too expansive and accurate, to accept with<br />\nequanimity an exposition of our weaknesses as well as our virtues, of our<br />\nfaults and failures as well as our successes. In addition, the article is<br />\ntinged at times with an intangible<br />\nair of a lack of sympathy with us and<br />\nour achievements, and of commendation which is given not from spontaneous admiration, but from a desire to be consistent with the verdict<br />\nwhich the world has pronounced.<br />\nEducation, that is collegiate and university education in the United States<br />\nis remakably free from deep rooted<br />\nevils, Mr. Harold Bolce et al, to the<br />\ncontrary, and perhaps Dr. Slosson in<br />\nthe preceding eleven articles in the<br />\nseries has exhausted his sympathy<br />\nand admired so profusely that now it<br />\nis easier for him to be critical than<br />\ncorrect. But let us see:<br />\n\"The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas no marble palaces or Gothic dormitories. There are few undergraduates and they are not distinguished<br />\nfor their prowess in football or for<br />\nAmerican Plan<br />\n<br />\nHotel Buena Vista<br />\nNorth Avenue and Calvert Street.<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nSPECIAL RATES TO STUDENTS<br />\n$5.00 up.<br />\n<br />\nspectacular eccentricities. It does not<br />\nundertake to do the work of the<br />\nthe shop, the patent office, the lyceum,<br />\nthe theatre, the government, the<br />\nchurch or the home. It indulges in<br />\nno fads and frills. It has no ancient<br />\nhistory. It is destitute of traditions<br />\nand picturesque customs. It is distracted by no class wars, faculty<br />\nfeuds, moral revolutions, student rebellions, newspaper scandals, or political persecutions. The chief student<br />\nactivity is study.<br />\n\"Consequently there is nothing left<br />\nto talk about except the two things<br />\nfor which all universities exist, learning and teaching. It is an institution<br />\nafter Woodrow Wilson's own heart;<br />\nwhere the side shows do not draw<br />\nfrom the main tent. Here are no<br />\ncannon ball jugglers, Circassian ladies, learned pigs, astrologers, fireeaters or street parades, such as rival<br />\nconcerns have. The whole show is under one canvas, or rather two in different parts of the city.\"<br />\nSo the article begins, and we are<br />\nat once put into a class above that<br />\nwhere newspaper advertising is a<br />\nmeans to an end,and where pomp and<br />\nartificiality are prevalent. But we are<br />\nreminded that though our University<br />\nhas few faults we are not necessarily<br />\ngreat, a thoroughly comforting assurance. It is directly due, however,<br />\nto the fact that we were, so to speak,<br />\nborn great, that we have never felt<br />\nthe need of blatantly blowing our<br />\nhorn. Our fame as an institution of<br />\nlearning rests upon higher ground.<br />\nWe have few faults because we are<br />\ngreat.<br />\nWith the policy of the University<br />\nfrom its inception and with the principles of the founders Dr. Slosson is<br />\npreeminently in sympathy. The work<br />\nof President Gilman and the 'Big<br />\nSix,\" Gildersleeve, Martin, Morris,<br />\nRemsen, Rowland, Sylvester, is given<br />\nwith accuracy and appreciation. Dr.<br />\nSlosson understands the Hopkins theory and the Hopkins idea. The<br />\nachievement in introducing real university methods, the immediate imitation by institutions of lesser rank<br />\nand fame, are directly accountable for<br />\nthe present extensive manufacture of<br />\nPh.D.'s. At first we had practically<br />\na monopoly,but now we have dropped<br />\nto seventh place. We console ourselves with the thought, however, that<br />\nwe are quality, not quantity. No<br />\nDoctor's degree was ever given here<br />\nfor a dissertation on \"The Amount<br />\nof Moisture Remaining in a Piece of<br />\nLitmus Paper After the Intonation<br />\nof the Fricatives.\" Our contributions to knowedge are important and<br />\nvital. Our graduates have become<br />\nfamous. Men, not buildings or sham<br />\nhas aways been our motto, both with<br />\nregard to the faculty and the student<br />\nbody. In speaking of an alumnus of<br />\nthe \"Big Four\" we say, \"He is a<br />\ngraduate of Harvard or Yale;\" here<br />\nwe say, \"He is a Hopkins man.\"<br />\nThere is a great distinction. The recognition of this in the early eighties<br />\nis told by Dr. Slosson as follows:<br />\n\"As I remember, it was in the later<br />\neighties that the Hopkins man appear-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER<br />\ned in the West.

Buckler, one of the trustees. During Mr. Buckler's residence<br />\nin Spain, he spent considerable time<br />\nin making a valuable collection of<br />\nthe ancient coins of that country,<br />\nmore than three thousand of which<br />\nhe presented to the University about<br />\na year ago. These coins bear inscriptions in four different languages<br />\n\u2014Latin, Greek, Celtiberian, and<br />\nPhcenician. For lack of a suitable<br />\nplace to deposit them, these coins<br />\nhave been lying in the vaults of the<br />\nTreasurer's office, but this will now<br />\nbe no longer necessary. Two weeks<br />\nago, on his arrival in this country,<br />\nMr. Buckler brought with him six<br />\nbeautiful cabinets of mahogany, similar to those which are used to house<br />\nthe coin collection of the British Museum. These cases have altogether<br />\na capacity of nearly six thousand<br />\ncoins, so that the present needs of the<br />\nUniversity coin collections are provided for.<br />\nThese gifts bring the Johns Hopkins to the first place among the American universities, so far as the collection of ancient coins is concerned. There is only one other American collection of ancient coins of<br />\nSpain which is in any sense comparable with this, namely, the Hispanic<br />\nSociety in New York.<br />\nDINE<br />\nHOPKINS' ALUMNI<br />\nThese cases which have been presented recently may be seen in the<br />\nThe tenth annual reunion and dinner of the class of 1899 of the Johns Latin Seminary Room.<br />\nHopkins University was held Friday<br />\nat the Stafford Hotel.

The<br />\nHonor System exists, naturally, for<br />\nthe benefit of the man who does not<br />\n'cheat, not for the weaker individual.<br />\nYet its workings, in the case of the<br />\ndiscovery of a culprit, are silent,practical, fair in application, and certain<br />\nin results. The center of action of<br />\nsuch a system lies in a committee,<br />\ncomposed of delegates elected by the<br />\ndifferent classes. If a student is accused of cheating\u201e he is brought before the committee, and tried in secret. If found guilty, his name is<br />\nreported by the commiAee to the<br />\nDean, who arranges for the boy to<br />\nflunk out of college at the next examination. All knowledge of the affair is confined to the commitee, the<br />\nmen at the trial, the Dean, and the<br />\nmembers of the faculty who arrange<br />\nto \"flunk out\" the culprit. These men<br />\nare in honor bound to Reep the matter secret, and the boy leaves college<br />\nfree to start over -again somewhere,<br />\nwithout the reputation of a cheat. The<br />\nsystem is as grim and noiseless as<br />\nthe guillotine, but in one way more<br />\nmerciful.<br />\n\\\\There such a system exists, supported by both faculty and students,<br />\nwith absolutely no restraint placed on<br />\na student in examinations, there are<br />\nat first several cases of heartburn and<br />\nsorrow which, however, are far offset<br />\nby the influence on the average student of the very existence and atmosphere of the Honor System around<br />\nhim.<br />\nThe initial point for the introduction of such a system lies, of course,<br />\nin discussion in class meetings.<br /><br />\nIn a certain Western college\u2014the<br />\nname of which we for the moment<br />\nforget\u2014the fraternities have united<br />\nin an unusual agreement. This agreement, is that freshmen may only become members of a fraternity upon<br />\npassing the matriculation examinations. This creation proceeds not<br />\nfrom the faculty, but from the stuGLOVES<br />\ndents and is worth a passing glance,<br />\nFOWNES<br />\nif only considered as an attempt from<br />\nolder students to extract better work<br />\nwin Fashion's races<br />\nfrom younger students. Youngsters<br />\n\"hands down\"<br />\nattracted by the allurements of fraternity life sometimes enter college<br />\nrather prematurely, so hampered by<br />\n\"conditions\"that the benefits of college<br />\neducation and surroundings come to<br />\nthem in an unnatural manner. Agreements between fraternities are not<br />\neasy to arrange, but in the case mentioned above it may be said that the<br />\nprospective undergraduate not only<br />\nhas an unusual incentive to industry \"HESSONIAN\"<br />\nA Smart Shoe for college men,<br />\nlaid before him, but also has a not<br />\nAdams Drug Company<br />\nunwise restriction placed upon his with a touch of newness that you'll<br />\nlike.<br />\ncollege course.<br />\nHoward and Monument Streets<br />\nTO BE OBTAINED ONLY AT<br />\nN.

Wood, Professor of Experimental Physics at the<br />\nUniversity, gave a most interesting<br />\nlecture last Wednesday afternoon,before the Hopkins Scientific Associa<br />\ntion.<br />\nThe subject of the lecture,which was<br />\nheld in the physical laboratory, was<br />\n\"Photography by means of invisible<br />\nrays.\"<br />\nDoctor Wood explained that the<br />\ncolors seen in the spectrum were not<br />\nthe only colors into which rays of<br />\nlight were decomposed, but that they<br />\nwere those to which the eye was<br />\nsensible. He said that there are rays<br />\nbeyond the spectrum which could be<br />\nseen by the eye. He explained how<br />\npictures could be taken by means of<br />\nthe ultra violet rays, if the spectrum<br />\nwas made opaque to the sunlight.<br />\nPictures could also be taken by means<br />\nof the infra red rays.<br />\nDoctor Wood presented a number<br />\nof interesting stereopticon views of<br />\nlandscapes, taken by means of the<br />\ninfra red and ultra violet rays. The<br />\ndecided difference between the two<br />\ndifferent types was very remarkable.<br />\nPictures taken by means of the infra red rays gave the appearance of<br />\nsnow scenes. While those taken with<br />\nthe ultra violet rays produced pictures different from normal photographs or those taken with the infra<br />\nred rays.<br /><br />\nbe an invariable antecedent. The mirage of the desert presents an appearance of objects reflected in a surface of water. In this case the heated<br />\nearth rarefies the air in the lower<br />\nstrata faster than it can escape, and<br />\nthe flatness of the ground conduces<br />\nto the maintenance of the resulting,<br />\nabnormal distribution of density. Displacement of mirage is commonly<br />\nvertical, but is lateral when the density-gradient is more or less inclined<br />\nto the vertical.\"<br />\nProfessor Wood took this theory up<br />\nin detail, and showed by practical experiment how the mirage appeared.<br />\nThe desert was a long sheet of iron<br />\ncovered with sand, which was given<br />\nthe necessary temperature by means<br />\nof gas burners. The sun was reflected, by means of a mirror, upon a<br />\nlarge sheet of white paper at one<br />\nend of the pseudo-desert, and this<br />\npaper served the additional purpose<br />\nof the sky-line. The sand became<br />\nheated, and to the rapt student, looking at the sand near the paper, it<br />\nappeared as if there was a clear pool<br />\nof crystal water on the iron plate. In<br />\nother words, the solution is this: The<br />\nwaves from the sky-line, which, under ordinary conditions, strike the<br />\nsand and are reflected and absorbed,<br />\n\u2014making us see the sand\u2014are, in<br />\nthis instance, refracted by the greatly expanded air near the surface of<br />\nthe hot sand. Therefore, looking<br />\nahead at some distant point in the<br />\ndesert we seem to see, not the neverending sand, but dancing light waves<br />\ncoming from the clear sky and creating the delicious image of a cool,<br />\nsparkling lake, with its surface slightly rippled by soft zephyrs.<br />\nThe same experiment has been performed before by Professor Wood,<br />\nwho is an expert in this line. Dr.<br />\nWood is a Fellow of the London<br />\nPhysical Society, and an Honorary<br />\nFellow of the Royal Microscopical<br />\nSociety, London.<br /><br />\nDr. Robert W. Wood, professor of<br />\nexperimental physics, whose special<br />\nfield of research is optics, gave his<br />\ngraduate class last week a practical<br />\ndemonstration of the desert mirage,<br />\nand the facility with which the hallucination plays upon the imagination<br />\nof the tired and thirsty traveler.<br />\nFor many years the explanation of<br />\nthe appearance of a beautiful lake of SPORTING GOODS<br />\nclear, sparkling water in the midst<br />\nof the desert, was laid to some superFROM<br />\nnatural source, and the many stories,<br />\nCHASE, HARVEY &amp; KERR<br />\nsome tradition, some fact, of which<br />\nwe have heard, have seemed to us<br />\n8 WEST FAYETTE STREET<br />\nfabrications of a mind which is so<br />\nProve Satisfactory to Us<br />\nbent on the obtaining of water, that<br />\nthe phantom vision seems to appear.<br />\nScientists thought that the mind beTRY THEM<br />\ncame disordered through heat and<br />\nthirst, but iheir explanation failed in<br />\nthe solution of mirages which appear-NOTCH<br />\ned to travelers in good physical condition and with plenty of water.<br />\nThe real solution was attained when<br />\nthe wave theory of light was propounded. \"A mirage,\" says the Century Dictionary, \"is an optical illusion, due to excessive bending of light<br />\nThe \"Ara-Notch\" makes the \"Belmont\"<br />\nrays in traversing adjacent layers of an<br />\nair of widely different densities,<br />\nwhereby distorted, displaced or inverted images are produced.

The Hopkins number of the Independent has<br />\nbeen awaited with a great deal of<br />\nanticipation, and the praise, criticism and misrepresentation, alas!<br />\nwhich Dr. Slosson judicially deals<br />\nout goes a long way, but hardly fulfills our expectations. But our expectations were, perhaps, too large; our<br />\nknowledge of Hopkins\u2014too expansive and accurate, to accept with<br />\nequanimity an exposition of our weaknesses as well as our virtues, of our<br />\nfaults and failures as well as our successes. In addition, the article is<br />\ntinged at times with an intangible<br />\nair of a lack of sympathy with us and<br />\nour achievements, and of commendation which is given not from spontaneous admiration, but from a desire to be consistent with the verdict<br />\nwhich the world has pronounced.<br />\nEducation, that is collegiate and university education in the United States<br />\nis remakably free from deep rooted<br />\nevils, Mr. Harold Bolce et al, to the<br />\ncontrary, and perhaps Dr. Slosson in<br />\nthe preceding eleven articles in the<br />\nseries has exhausted his sympathy<br />\nand admired so profusely that now it<br />\nis easier for him to be critical than<br />\ncorrect. But let us see:<br />\n\"The Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhas no marble palaces or Gothic dormitories. There are few undergraduates and they are not distinguished<br />\nfor their prowess in football or for<br />\nAmerican Plan<br /><br />\nHotel Buena Vista<br />\nNorth Avenue and Calvert Street.<br />\nBaltimore, Md.<br />\nSPECIAL RATES TO STUDENTS<br />\n$5.00 up.<br /><br />\nspectacular eccentricities. It does not<br />\nundertake to do the work of the<br />\nthe shop, the patent office, the lyceum,<br />\nthe theatre, the government, the<br />\nchurch or the home. It indulges in<br />\nno fads and frills. It has no ancient<br />\nhistory. It is destitute of traditions<br />\nand picturesque customs. It is distracted by no class wars, faculty<br />\nfeuds, moral revolutions, student rebellions, newspaper scandals, or political persecutions. The chief student<br />\nactivity is study.<br />\n\"Consequently there is nothing left<br />\nto talk about except the two things<br />\nfor which all universities exist, learning and teaching. It is an institution<br />\nafter Woodrow Wilson's own heart;<br />\nwhere the side shows do not draw<br />\nfrom the main tent. Here are no<br />\ncannon ball jugglers, Circassian ladies, learned pigs, astrologers, fireeaters or street parades, such as rival<br />\nconcerns have. The whole show is under one canvas, or rather two in different parts of the city.\"<br />\nSo the article begins, and we are<br />\nat once put into a class above that<br />\nwhere newspaper advertising is a<br />\nmeans to an end,and where pomp and<br />\nartificiality are prevalent. But we are<br />\nreminded that though our University<br />\nhas few faults we are not necessarily<br />\ngreat, a thoroughly comforting assurance. It is directly due, however,<br />\nto the fact that we were, so to speak,<br />\nborn great, that we have never felt<br />\nthe need of blatantly blowing our<br />\nhorn. Our fame as an institution of<br />\nlearning rests upon higher ground.<br />\nWe have few faults because we are<br />\ngreat.<br />\nWith the policy of the University<br />\nfrom its inception and with the principles of the founders Dr. Slosson is<br />\npreeminently in sympathy. The work<br />\nof President Gilman and the 'Big<br />\nSix,\" Gildersleeve, Martin, Morris,<br />\nRemsen, Rowland, Sylvester, is given<br />\nwith accuracy and appreciation. Dr.<br />\nSlosson understands the Hopkins theory and the Hopkins idea. The<br />\nachievement in introducing real university methods, the immediate imitation by institutions of lesser rank<br />\nand fame, are directly accountable for<br />\nthe present extensive manufacture of<br />\nPh.D.'s. At first we had practically<br />\na monopoly,but now we have dropped<br />\nto seventh place. We console ourselves with the thought, however, that<br />\nwe are quality, not quantity. No<br />\nDoctor's degree was ever given here<br />\nfor a dissertation on \"The Amount<br />\nof Moisture Remaining in a Piece of<br />\nLitmus Paper After the Intonation<br />\nof the Fricatives.\" Our contributions to knowedge are important and<br />\nvital. Our graduates have become<br />\nfamous. Men, not buildings or sham<br />\nhas aways been our motto, both with<br />\nregard to the faculty and the student<br />\nbody. In speaking of an alumnus of<br />\nthe \"Big Four\" we say, \"He is a<br />\ngraduate of Harvard or Yale;\" here<br />\nwe say, \"He is a Hopkins man.\"<br />\nThere is a great distinction. The recognition of this in the early eighties<br />\nis told by Dr. Slosson as follows:<br />\n\"As I remember, it was in the later<br />\neighties that the Hopkins man appear-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER<br />\ned in the West.

At<br />\ntimes the article is pleasing, at others<br />\nobnoxious.
