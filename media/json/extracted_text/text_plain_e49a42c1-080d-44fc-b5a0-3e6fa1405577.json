We assume that<br />\nall of you are here to derive as much as possible from<br />\nfour years of college life in order to equip yourselves<br />\nfor the harder battle that lies directly ahead. With<br />\nthat assumption in mind, we counsel:<br />\nEnter upon your academic work with a free, open<br />\nand inquiring mind. Nothing that you should know will<br />\nbe purposely withheld from you at the Hopkins. If you<br />\ndon't quite comprehend, feel free to question. If you<br />\ndon't agree, you will have every opportunity to voice<br />\nyour own opinion. At the same time, !don't assume an<br />\n\"I'm right, you're wrong\" attitude. There's nothing an<br />\ninstructor despises more thoroughlir.<br />\nMap out for yourself, with the help of your advisor,<br />\na well-rounded schedule. Naturally, include those subjects which will prove of greatest assistance to you in<br />\nyour intended vocation. Also see to it that you enroll<br />\nin those courses which will provide you with a better<br />\neducational background and perspective. And above<br />\neverything else, always keep correlating the knowledge<br />\ngleaned from your various courses, wherever any connection is, possible. In effect, strive to make your education one consistent panorama. The returns will be<br />\nheavy, if not immediately apparent.<br />\nParticipate in activities if at all possible, but do not<br />\ndo so if it means the absolute neglect of your scholastic<br />\nwork. Too many students have sacrificed themselves<br />\nto the god of activity only to find that theirs was an<br />\nempty and malevolent deity. As in the case of studies,<br />\nselect a variety of activities, even though your interest<br />\nmay lie in one particular field. You will be surprised to<br />\nfind what latent abilities you possess.<br />\n<br />\n0.<br />\n<br />\nLook upon your instructors as men interested in<br />\nyour welfare rather than as human machines without<br />\nspark or animation. Seek their respect; cultivate their<br />\nfriendship. Rid yourselves of the notion that all contact<br />\nbetween student and teacher should be confined to the<br />\nclassroom, as is too often the conception derived from<br />\nhigh school experience. Consult them on any problems<br />\nwhich may arise, and see whether the overwhelming<br />\nmajority isn't sympathetic and helpful.<br />\nKeep abreast of current events while in college.<br />\nResist the tendency to restrict yourselves to problems<br />\nemanating from your text-books or the campus.

We assume that<br />\nall of you are here to derive as much as possible from<br />\nfour years of college life in order to equip yourselves<br />\nfor the harder battle that lies directly ahead. With<br />\nthat assumption in mind, we counsel:<br />\nEnter upon your academic work with a free, open<br />\nand inquiring mind. Nothing that you should know will<br />\nbe purposely withheld from you at the Hopkins. If you<br />\ndon't quite comprehend, feel free to question. If you<br />\ndon't agree, you will have every opportunity to voice<br />\nyour own opinion. At the same time, !don't assume an<br />\n\"I'm right, you're wrong\" attitude. There's nothing an<br />\ninstructor despises more thoroughlir.<br />\nMap out for yourself, with the help of your advisor,<br />\na well-rounded schedule. Naturally, include those subjects which will prove of greatest assistance to you in<br />\nyour intended vocation. Also see to it that you enroll<br />\nin those courses which will provide you with a better<br />\neducational background and perspective. And above<br />\neverything else, always keep correlating the knowledge<br />\ngleaned from your various courses, wherever any connection is, possible. In effect, strive to make your education one consistent panorama. The returns will be<br />\nheavy, if not immediately apparent.<br />\nParticipate in activities if at all possible, but do not<br />\ndo so if it means the absolute neglect of your scholastic<br />\nwork. Too many students have sacrificed themselves<br />\nto the god of activity only to find that theirs was an<br />\nempty and malevolent deity. As in the case of studies,<br />\nselect a variety of activities, even though your interest<br />\nmay lie in one particular field. You will be surprised to<br />\nfind what latent abilities you possess.<br /><br />\n0.<br /><br />\nLook upon your instructors as men interested in<br />\nyour welfare rather than as human machines without<br />\nspark or animation. Seek their respect; cultivate their<br />\nfriendship. Rid yourselves of the notion that all contact<br />\nbetween student and teacher should be confined to the<br />\nclassroom, as is too often the conception derived from<br />\nhigh school experience. Consult them on any problems<br />\nwhich may arise, and see whether the overwhelming<br />\nmajority isn't sympathetic and helpful.<br />\nKeep abreast of current events while in college.<br />\nResist the tendency to restrict yourselves to problems<br />\nemanating from your text-books or the campus.
