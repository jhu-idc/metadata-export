This amendment, in<br />\nits original form also stipulated<br />\nthat the SC President and all<br />\nformer Spring Fair chairpersons<br />\nstill on campus would also vote<br />\nin the selection.<br />\nFeltheimer said that he saw a<br />\nneed to broaden the selection<br />\nprocess for the Fair. \"When just<br />\none person does the selecting, he<br />\nlooks at his friends, while<br />\nperhaps others besides this<br />\nintimate circle might be capable<br />\nto run the activity,\" he said.<br />\nHowever, many Student<br />\nCouncil members, especially the<br />\nSelections Committee were<br />\nopposed to the proposal because<br />\nit set a precedent of involving<br />\noutsiders, such as ex-chairmen of<br />\nevents, in the selection process.<br />\n\"I think a precedent of<br />\nincluding others besides<br />\n<br />\nCommittee members would have<br />\nbeen bad,\" asserted Andy<br />\nFredman, Chairman of the<br />\nSelections Committee.<br />\nA new amendment was then<br />\nproposed, giving the Selections<br />\nCommittee the power to chose<br />\n-mt<br />\n<br />\nSue Blum<br />\n<br />\nNew building's cost prevents residential use<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nThe 3201 North Charles Street<br />\napartment house recently<br />\nacquired by the University in a<br />\ncorporate purchase will be used<br />\nfor office rather than residential<br />\nspace because \"the high cost of<br />\nthe building prohibited<br />\nresidential use,\" according to<br />\nJanet Johnson, Hopkins' Real<br />\n<br />\nProperty Investment Officer.<br />\nShe explained that those<br />\nUniversity offices which will use<br />\nthe building will probably have<br />\nsources of outside funding which<br />\nwill enable them to meet the high<br />\nrental fees necessitated by the<br />\nfacility's cost.<br />\n\"It is my preference,\" she said,<br />\n\"that the building be used by<br />\n<br />\nactivities which will have access<br />\nto outside funding.\"<br />\n\"The University. ,can't afford<br />\nto completely subsidize use of<br />\nthe building,\" she added.<br />\nJohnson stated that a shortage<br />\nof campus office space gave rise<br />\nto the decision to enter into the<br />\nbidding for, and eventually<br />\npurchase, the 3201 North Charles<br />\n<br />\nNine to attend Penn conference<br />\nBy ELLEN BERNHARD<br />\nNine students from the<br />\nStudent Council's Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee will attend a<br />\nconference at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania on lobbying for<br />\nfederal aid to private universities<br />\nlater this month.<br />\nThe Council is sending<br />\nrepresentatives t9 the conference<br />\nin order to learn more about<br />\nmethods of legislative lobbying in<br />\npreparation for an area-wide<br />\neffort to press for increased<br />\nFederal student aid in January,<br />\naccording to Erik Molander,<br />\nchairman of the SC Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n\"The most important thing we<br />\nhope to gain are contacts in D.C.<br />\nand methods of approaching<br />\nthese people,\" said Molander.<br />\n\"Then we'll have a concerted<br />\neffort of 14 schools to go to D.C.<br />\nand say, 'Listen, we're tired of<br />\nyou cutting our aid.' This move<br />\nwill probably come about in<br />\nJanuary.\"<br />\nMolander explained that the<br />\nconference will include other<br />\nprivate schools from the Eastern<br />\ncoast area, including Swarthmore<br />\nand the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. The schools will<br />\nlobby against Senatorial<br />\nscholarships, according to<br />\nMolander because of \"a lot of<br />\nabuses,\" and will lobby for the<br />\nNDSL (National Defense Student<br />\nLoan), the F1SL (Federally<br />\nInsured Student Loan), SEOG<br />\n(Secondary Education<br />\nOpportunity Grant), and<br />\nwork-study grants, which are in<br />\nimmediate danger of being<br />\ndrastically decreased or cut<br />\n<br />\naltogether by the Federal<br />\nGovernment.<br />\n\"These are all very good<br />\nloans,\" said Molander. \"The<br />\nNDSL is a 3% interest loan. It<br />\nseems now that President Ford<br />\nwants to get rid of it. The FISL is<br />\na 7% loan, which will probably<br />\nbe cut out next year, and SEOG<br />\nis a grant to low income<br />\nfamilies.\"<br />\nIn addition, the Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee will press Hopkins'<br />\nadministrators to increase aid to<br />\nincoming students.<br />\n\"For 75-76, Hopkins has only<br />\ncommitted itself to $1,000,000<br />\nin financial aid,\" explained<br />\nMolander. \"That would be an<br />\nincrease of $100,000 over last<br />\n<br />\nyear's $900,000. This doesn't<br />\neven cover the tuition increase<br />\nfor students. That comes to<br />\n$240,000.\"<br />\n\"Hopkins must make a strong<br />\nmove to put more money where<br />\nit is needed. The way it stands<br />\nnow, a student will have to pay<br />\n$6,000 or more next year to<br />\ncome to Hopkins, with housing<br />\nand books and all.\"<br />\nMolander stressed that if<br />\nfinancial aid is cut, enrollments<br />\nwould drop.<br />\n\"There will definitely be a<br />\nshift of the type of student we<br />\nget here,\" he said. \"Students who<br />\nreally want to come will make it<br />\nsomehow.

In addition to<br />\nthe keyboard virtuosity of Corea, there is<br />\nthe bass wizardry of Stanley Clarke and<br />\nthe rhythmic drive of Lenny White. In<br />\nfact, the only musician on the album who<br />\ndoesn't stand out is guitarist Al DiMeola,<br />\nand that is due solely to underexposure.<br />\nThis multiplicity of function in the<br />\nband, the ability to play so tightly that<br />\nthe definition of soloist and sideman is<br />\nblurred into irrelevancy, is due in large<br />\npart to the arrangements used by the<br />\nband. Throughout the album, there is a<br />\nclose interrelation between the solo-space<br />\nallotted to the players and the various<br />\nstatements and restatements of the<br />\ntheme, as in Vulcan Worlds.<br />\nCompositionally, the band is much like<br />\nthe Modern Jazz Quartet, whose intricate<br />\n<br />\ntight the band is. Lenny White (one of<br />\nthe most underrated drummers around<br />\ntoday, in many ways superior to Billy<br />\nCobham) provides a driving rhythmic<br />\npulse to the playing, and is the perfect<br />\ncounterpart to the harmonic bedrock of<br />\nStanley Clarke\u2014 greatest electric bassist<br />\nthere is(and that includes Jack Bruce).<br />\nAnd those of you who flipped over<br />\nCorea's Piano Improvisations albums on<br />\nECM will enjoy the acoustic brilliancy of<br />\nthe three Where Have /... selections on<br />\n<br />\nthe album (based, by the way, on a lovely<br />\npoem by Neveille Potter, the lyricist on<br />\nthe albums Return to Forever, Light As.4<br />\nFeather, and Children ofForever).<br />\nProbably, if anything sums up the<br />\nalbum, it's the last cut on side<br />\none\u2014Beyond the Seventh Galaxy.

Benton contends that<br />\nthe group should review the<br />\neffectiveness of student-directed<br />\nprograms and should, not concern<br />\nitself with the \"translation of<br />\nthese programs into dollars.\"<br />\n\"Students have a very proper<br />\nrole to give us their views on how<br />\nwe do our job,\" Benton asserted.<br />\n\"The committee would be more<br />\nuseful if it evaluated programs<br />\nand set program priorities rather<br />\nthan becoming tied down with<br />\nthe pricing out of every item.\"<br />\n\"Program evaluation is<br />\nexactly the kind of feedback we<br /><br />\nneed in making a budget,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nAlan Fink, SC Treasurer and<br />\nco-chairman of the BAC,<br />\nasserted, however, that the<br />\ncommittee \"will be merely<br />\nduplicating the efforts of a dozen<br />\nother Student Council groups\" if<br />\nit is \"reduced to programatic<br />\naffairs.\"<br />\n\"We want to go to the various,<br />\ndepartments of interest to the<br />\nstudents and find out exactly<br /><br />\nthe event.\"<br />\nFitzpatrick revealed that<br />\nsecurity forces will be bolstered<br />\nfor the event and that Baltimore<br />\nCity Police will make a search of<br />\nthe Athletic Center prior to the<br />\nconcert.<br />\nSC Vice President Eric<br />\nRosenson termed ticket sales<br />\n\"very slow.\" \"We have only sold<br />\n150 tickets,\" he said.

This amendment, in<br />\nits original form also stipulated<br />\nthat the SC President and all<br />\nformer Spring Fair chairpersons<br />\nstill on campus would also vote<br />\nin the selection.<br />\nFeltheimer said that he saw a<br />\nneed to broaden the selection<br />\nprocess for the Fair. \"When just<br />\none person does the selecting, he<br />\nlooks at his friends, while<br />\nperhaps others besides this<br />\nintimate circle might be capable<br />\nto run the activity,\" he said.<br />\nHowever, many Student<br />\nCouncil members, especially the<br />\nSelections Committee were<br />\nopposed to the proposal because<br />\nit set a precedent of involving<br />\noutsiders, such as ex-chairmen of<br />\nevents, in the selection process.<br />\n\"I think a precedent of<br />\nincluding others besides<br /><br />\nCommittee members would have<br />\nbeen bad,\" asserted Andy<br />\nFredman, Chairman of the<br />\nSelections Committee.<br />\nA new amendment was then<br />\nproposed, giving the Selections<br />\nCommittee the power to chose<br />\n-mt<br /><br />\nSue Blum<br /><br />\nNew building's cost prevents residential use<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nThe 3201 North Charles Street<br />\napartment house recently<br />\nacquired by the University in a<br />\ncorporate purchase will be used<br />\nfor office rather than residential<br />\nspace because \"the high cost of<br />\nthe building prohibited<br />\nresidential use,\" according to<br />\nJanet Johnson, Hopkins' Real<br /><br />\nProperty Investment Officer.<br />\nShe explained that those<br />\nUniversity offices which will use<br />\nthe building will probably have<br />\nsources of outside funding which<br />\nwill enable them to meet the high<br />\nrental fees necessitated by the<br />\nfacility's cost.<br />\n\"It is my preference,\" she said,<br />\n\"that the building be used by<br /><br />\nactivities which will have access<br />\nto outside funding.\"<br />\n\"The University. ,can't afford<br />\nto completely subsidize use of<br />\nthe building,\" she added.<br />\nJohnson stated that a shortage<br />\nof campus office space gave rise<br />\nto the decision to enter into the<br />\nbidding for, and eventually<br />\npurchase, the 3201 North Charles<br /><br />\nNine to attend Penn conference<br />\nBy ELLEN BERNHARD<br />\nNine students from the<br />\nStudent Council's Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee will attend a<br />\nconference at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania on lobbying for<br />\nfederal aid to private universities<br />\nlater this month.<br />\nThe Council is sending<br />\nrepresentatives t9 the conference<br />\nin order to learn more about<br />\nmethods of legislative lobbying in<br />\npreparation for an area-wide<br />\neffort to press for increased<br />\nFederal student aid in January,<br />\naccording to Erik Molander,<br />\nchairman of the SC Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee.<br />\n\"The most important thing we<br />\nhope to gain are contacts in D.C.<br />\nand methods of approaching<br />\nthese people,\" said Molander.<br />\n\"Then we'll have a concerted<br />\neffort of 14 schools to go to D.C.<br />\nand say, 'Listen, we're tired of<br />\nyou cutting our aid.' This move<br />\nwill probably come about in<br />\nJanuary.\"<br />\nMolander explained that the<br />\nconference will include other<br />\nprivate schools from the Eastern<br />\ncoast area, including Swarthmore<br />\nand the University of<br />\nPennsylvania. The schools will<br />\nlobby against Senatorial<br />\nscholarships, according to<br />\nMolander because of \"a lot of<br />\nabuses,\" and will lobby for the<br />\nNDSL (National Defense Student<br />\nLoan), the F1SL (Federally<br />\nInsured Student Loan), SEOG<br />\n(Secondary Education<br />\nOpportunity Grant), and<br />\nwork-study grants, which are in<br />\nimmediate danger of being<br />\ndrastically decreased or cut<br /><br />\naltogether by the Federal<br />\nGovernment.<br />\n\"These are all very good<br />\nloans,\" said Molander. \"The<br />\nNDSL is a 3% interest loan. It<br />\nseems now that President Ford<br />\nwants to get rid of it. The FISL is<br />\na 7% loan, which will probably<br />\nbe cut out next year, and SEOG<br />\nis a grant to low income<br />\nfamilies.\"<br />\nIn addition, the Financial Aid<br />\nCommittee will press Hopkins'<br />\nadministrators to increase aid to<br />\nincoming students.<br />\n\"For 75-76, Hopkins has only<br />\ncommitted itself to $1,000,000<br />\nin financial aid,\" explained<br />\nMolander. \"That would be an<br />\nincrease of $100,000 over last<br /><br />\nyear's $900,000.

From<br />\nits crystal set origins in the early 20's AM<br />\nradio has expanded through years of<br />\ntechnical and artistic experimentation to<br />\nproduce a crystal set media. AMradio still<br />\nsnaps, crackles and pops in time with the<br />\nlightening of your neighbor's fluorescent<br />\nlights, and spews forth some of the dryest<br />\nmusic and has become a veritable cultural<br />\ndesert.<br />\nAM radios are still a staple for the<br />\nworking man, the housewife, and the<br />\ncommuter. When FM appeared on more<br />\nand more radios a decade or so ago, it<br />\nlooked as though AM was on its way out;<br />\nbut this has simply not been the case.<br />\nThe format of AM is strictly<br />\ncommercial with a dash of music and<br />\nlocal services. These services include<br />\ntraffic reports, news, weather reports,<br />\nchurch announcements, and public<br />\nservice announcements. Few other media<br />\nformats can deal with these services as<br />\nefficiently as AM radio: the biggest<br />\nservice here is that this repetitive filler is<br />\nkeep off of FM! How many times can you<br />\nlisten to the same weather report every<br />\nten or twelve minutes? How many times<br />\ndo you want to hear that Nixon's<br />\nphlebitis is progressing slowly?

But the resemblance stops<br />\nthere. When RTF plays, there is no doubt<br />\nthat it is not MJQ. In fact, the band that<br />\nRTF is most often compared to is the<br />\nMahavishnu Orchestra in its Jan<br />\nHammer-Billy Cobham days. But again,<br />\nthe resemblamce is only superficial.<br />\nPerhaps the best way to describe this<br />\nalbum and the \"new\" band (as this<br />\nconstitutes the fourth version of RTF to<br />\ndate) is thorugh the word textures. The<br />\nentire album is a perfect example of how<br />\nto play off intensity and drive against<br />\nmelody and dynamics, and the key is<br />\nthrough the use of colouration,<br />\ninstrumentation, voicing\u2014in short,<br />\ntextures.<br />\nCompare Where Have I Known You<br />\nBefore to RTF's last album, The Homn of<br />\nthe Seventh Galaxy (Polydor PD 5536).<br />\nThere is the same energy, the same<br />\nmelodic beauty, the same intensity, and<br />\n(with the exception of the guitarist) the<br />\nsame personnel The differance is in the<br />\ndepth of sound, and the new album's<br />\ngreater depth makes for greater listening<br />\nenjoyment; in short, RTF has improved<br />\non perfection!<br />\nVulcan Worlds is a powerful tune<br />\ncentered around an eight-chord thematic<br />\nstatement, featuring remarkable solos by<br />\nCorea's lightly dancing synthesizer and<br />\nClarke's blistering bass.

In addition to<br />\nthe keyboard virtuosity of Corea, there is<br />\nthe bass wizardry of Stanley Clarke and<br />\nthe rhythmic drive of Lenny White. In<br />\nfact, the only musician on the album who<br />\ndoesn't stand out is guitarist Al DiMeola,<br />\nand that is due solely to underexposure.<br />\nThis multiplicity of function in the<br />\nband, the ability to play so tightly that<br />\nthe definition of soloist and sideman is<br />\nblurred into irrelevancy, is due in large<br />\npart to the arrangements used by the<br />\nband. Throughout the album, there is a<br />\nclose interrelation between the solo-space<br />\nallotted to the players and the various<br />\nstatements and restatements of the<br />\ntheme, as in Vulcan Worlds.<br />\nCompositionally, the band is much like<br />\nthe Modern Jazz Quartet, whose intricate<br /><br />\ntight the band is. Lenny White (one of<br />\nthe most underrated drummers around<br />\ntoday, in many ways superior to Billy<br />\nCobham) provides a driving rhythmic<br />\npulse to the playing, and is the perfect<br />\ncounterpart to the harmonic bedrock of<br />\nStanley Clarke\u2014 greatest electric bassist<br />\nthere is(and that includes Jack Bruce).<br />\nAnd those of you who flipped over<br />\nCorea's Piano Improvisations albums on<br />\nECM will enjoy the acoustic brilliancy of<br />\nthe three Where Have /... selections on<br /><br />\nthe album (based, by the way, on a lovely<br />\npoem by Neveille Potter, the lyricist on<br />\nthe albums Return to Forever, Light As.4<br />\nFeather, and Children ofForever).<br />\nProbably, if anything sums up the<br />\nalbum, it's the last cut on side<br />\none\u2014Beyond the Seventh Galaxy. Not<br />\nonly is this album beyond the Seventh<br />\nGalaxy, it is beyond belief.
