Stevens<br />\nseemed to be able to go through<br />\nthe Hopkins line at will, and repeatedly carried the ball to within<br />\nseveral yards of the Hopkins goal<br />\nline. The one bright spot in the<br />\nHopkins play was the way the<br />\nBlack and Blue held its opponents<br />\nunder the shadow of its own goal<br />\nposts. Three times Stevens advanced the pigskin within less than<br />\nten yards of the Hopkins goal line,<br />\nonly to be held for downs. Buttfield, the Stevens quarter, showed<br />\npoor judgment in always trying to<br />\nmake the required distance on the<br />\nthird down, and not trying a dropkick when directly in front of the<br />\ngoal posts. In the last quarter, a<br />\ndropkick would have been worth<br />\nas much to the visitors as a touchdown.<br />\nForward passes were worked successfully by SteArens, directly over<br />\nthe line of scrimmage. Many of<br />\nthem should have been blocked by<br />\nHopkins. Both sides made so many<br />\nfumbles that the spectators' were<br />\nprepared for almost anything. The<br />\nHopkins line will have to be<br />\nstrengthened. The guard positions<br />\nespecially seemed to be weak spots.<br />\nPenniman's absence is severely felt<br />\nby Hopkins.

His work under the circumstances was good, and be will<br />\ngreatly strengthen the team in the<br />\nrest of the games this season.<br />\nThe Hopkins players tackled poorly. Their object appeared to be to<br />\ngrab their opponents by the ears, if<br />\nPossible, instead of tackling low, as<br />\nthey should have done. Poor tackling on the part of the Black and<br />\nBlue several times enabled the<br />\nStevens back to advance 8 or 10<br />\nyards after being tackled,<br />\nPieper caught the ball on the<br />\nkick-off and advanced it to Hopkins<br />\n3o-yard line. On the second<br />\nplay Gillet carried the pigskin well<br />\ninto the midfield on a forward pass.<br />\nStevens held Hopkins for downs<br />\nand secured the spheroid. It changed<br />\nhands several times before the<br />\nend of the quarter. Harris tried a<br />\ndrop kick, but failed. The quarter<br />\nended with Hopkins in possession<br />\nof the ball on its 14-yard line.

Twice in the last<br />\nperiod of play Stevens advanced<br />\nthe pigskin within striking distance<br />\nof the goal line, but were held by<br />\nthe Black and Blue.

Hering they rushed for<br />\neach other.<br />\nThe rush consisted of three<br />\nrounds of one minute each. At<br />\nthe end of that time the class having<br />\nthe least number of members on<br />\nthe ground was adjudged the winner. Contrary to expectations,<br />\nthe judges allowed the members of<br />\neach class who showed up to take<br />\npart. It had been understood that<br />\nthe sides were to be equal. The<br />\nfreshmen had about forty-five combatants and the sophomores thirty.<br />\nIn spite of the overwhelming<br />\nodds, the sophs put up a gallant<br />\nfight, and actually succeeded in<br />\nwinning one out of the three<br />\nrounds.

It is now nearly<br />\ntwenty years since the late Professor Brooks established the first laboratory on the southern shore of<br />\nthe island, a few miles from Kingston. Work was carried on in this<br />\nlaboratory for many years, but Professor Brooks was not entirely satisfied with the location, because of<br />\ntrade winds which blow almost incessantly and make work on marine<br />\nanimals difficult. It was then that<br />\nProfessor Andrews circled the island (it is 150 miles long and 50<br />\nmiles wide), largely on foot, to find<br />\na better site for a marine laboratory. He found that Montego Bay,<br />\non the northwestern coast, was excellently adapted to work on marine<br />\nanimals. The coast line is fringed<br />\nby mountains 1500 to 2000 feet in<br />\nheight, which rise to an altitude of<br />\na mile in the interior of the island.<br />\nThe bay is therefore well protected<br />\nfrom the trade winds and it is possible to venture far out in an open<br />\nboat without danger of being<br />\nswamped. At this time, however,<br />\nMontego Bay was very difficult of<br />\naccess. There were no boat lines<br />\nrunning there, and there was no<br />\nrailroad from Kingston. So the<br />\nchange of location could not be<br />\nmade at the time.<br />\nThis year, however, an expedition was organized under auspicious circumstances. It was the first<br />\nexpedition since the disastrous one<br />\nto Port Antonio (on the northeast<br />\ncoast) in 19o1, when Professors<br />\nHumphrey and Conant lost their<br />\nlives through yellow fever. In the<br />\nperiod since Professor Andrews'<br />\nfirst visit to Montego Bay, regular<br />\nboat service has been established<br />\nbetween this town and Baltimore,<br />\nPhiladelphia and New York, and<br />\nthe railroad to Kingston has been<br />\ncompleted, making communication<br />\nwith the rest of the island a simple<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe expedition went in two sections; the botanists leaving May II,<br />\nwhereas the zoologists did not go<br />\nuntil June. The memEers of the<br />\nparty were: Professor Andrews,<br />\nDr. Graves, Dr. Cowles, Messrs.<br />\nWilson, Givler, Middleton, and<br />\nLund; Prof. Johnson and Messrs.<br />\nYork. Brown, and Sharp. The<br />\nbotanists, under Prof. Johnson,<br />\nspent the greater part of the time<br />\nhigh up in the mountains, while the<br />\nzoologists, with Prof. Andrews,<br />\n<br />\nHopkins is too young to have<br />\nmany famous graduates, and the<br />\ntheory in education which the University has stood for has been of<br />\nsuch a character that the men who<br />\nchose to come here and study have<br />\nnot, as a rule, entered those vocations in which it is easiest to<br />\nachieve fame. If the roster of those<br />\nHopkins alumni who hold important professorial and scientific positions were gone over, it would be<br />\nfound that we stand second to none.<br />\nBut the men whom the public gets<br />\nto know easiest are the politicians,<br />\nthe statesmen, and the candidates<br />\nfor office. But among these public<br />\nfigures, many of whom are being<br />\nmentioned as presidential possibilities, is a Democratic candidate for<br />\ngovernor,- a Hopkins man who is<br />\nmaking a good fight, with fine<br />\nchances for success, and is rallying<br />\nto his support as a political leader,<br />\na vast following.<br />\nStarting out in life as a lawyer,<br />\nand then deciding that his vocation<br />\nlay in educational lines, and preparing himself for this work by coming<br />\nto Hopkins, Woodrow Wilson, now<br />\ncandidate for governor on the Democratic ticket in New Jersey, is the<br />\nmost illustrious example today of<br />\nthe muth-discussed scholar in politics, and is without doubt Hopkins'<br />\nmost famous alumnus. With his elevation to the presidency of Princeton University he came near being the most famous educator, as<br />\nwell as one of the greatest scholars<br />\nwhich the University had produced; but in his new role which<br />\nhe essays without solicitation on<br />\nhis part, and only on the united<br />\nrequest of the Democrats of New<br />\nJersey, he is one of the great public<br />\nfigures of the day, with presidential<br />\npossibilities which, when the next<br />\nconvention is held, will have to be<br />\nlooked out for.<br />\nThe information possessed by the<br />\nordinary voter relative to candidates for office is, we may say, of<br />\ntwo kinds. With a man who has<br />\nhad an interesting and almost fantastic life, as had Lincoln, the<br />\npeople know more of his personal<br />\nhistory than they do of what he<br />\nstands for, or his mental attainments and capacity concerning political problems. But with Wilson,<br />\nthe case is different.

First of all,<br />\nthe coast is fringed by coral reefs<br />\nwhich furnish an abundance of interesting material. Secondly, being<br />\nthe lee shore of the island, a great<br />\ndeal of material collects on the surface of the water close to shore,<br />\ndrifting in from the surrounding<br />\nocean and carried in by the tide.<br />\nThirdly, there is a group of islands<br />\nvery irregular in shape and of small<br />\nextent just off the shore, which<br />\nwere probably formed by the settling of the land. These islands<br />\nare covered with a dense growth of<br />\nmangrove trees, which hang their<br />\nroots in the water. All manner<br />\nof animals collect .on these roots;<br />\nand it is only necessary to row to<br />\na tree and lift one of the roots<br />\ninto the boat in order to get tubs<br />\nfull of all kinds and descriptions.<br />\nA great mass of material was<br />\nbrought back for study. Among<br />\nthe many interesting objects was<br />\na live lizard a foot and a half or<br />\ntwo feet long,'which weighed ten<br />\npounds. Unfortunately, it died last<br />\nweek. When .Columbus came to<br />\nAmerica, there were a great many<br />\n,of these lizards in Jamaica, but now<br />\nthey have almost entirely disappeared. The disappearance of this<br />\nspecies of lizard is due principally<br />\nto the mongoose. The mongoose<br />\nwas originally imported from India<br />\nfor the purpose .of destroying the<br />\nnts, which are a great pest on the<br />\nisland. But the rats were at work<br />\nwhile the mongoose slept; and,<br />\nmoreover, a mongoose cannot climb<br />\na tree, .which is a simple problem<br />\nfor the Jamaican rat. The result<br />\nwas that the mongoose turned elsewhere for a living, and is doing<br />\nmore damage than the rats formerly did.<br />\nA large number of hermit, crabs<br />\nwere brought back and are now<br />\nkept alive in the biological laboratory.

Coming to this country, he<br />\nreceived his collegiate education at<br />\nHope College, and from that institution came to the Romance department of the Hopkins. He received<br />\nhis degree in 1888, and immediately<br />\ntook a position in the faculty of<br />\n*Bowdoin College. Later, he went<br />\nto the University of Indiana, and<br />\nin 1893 took charge of the Romance<br />\ndepartment at Leland Stanford, Jr.,<br />\nUniversity, a position which he held<br />\nuntil his death.<br />\nFIe was widely known among<br />\nlanguage scholars, and will be long<br />\nremembered for a long and masterful series of works upon old and<br />\nmodern French literature and<br />\ngrammar, besides numerous French<br />\nand Spanish texts which he edited.<br />\nOne of his most valuable contributions to modern language study is<br />\nhis Spanish grammar, which in a<br />\nsense, revolutionized the teaching<br />\nof that language, by first applying<br />\nto it modern methods.<br />\n<br />\nRecord breaking is the number of<br />\nstudents in the chemical department of the University according<br />\nto Prof. Harry C. Jones, professor of physical chemistry. Both<br />\nundergraduates and graduate students are taking chemistry in numbers previously unknown in the<br />\ndepartment. More than 150 separate students are enrolled in the<br />\ndifferent classes or doing special<br />\nwork in the laboratories. There<br />\nare more than 40 graduates who<br />\nare making chemistry their major,<br />\nand of these more than 30 are<br />\nregularly entered as candidates for<br />\nthe degree of doctor of philosophy<br />\nin this department.<br />\nThat such a number of students<br />\novertaxes the provisions of the<br />\nlaboratories goes without saying<br />\nwhen the conditions that usually<br />\nprevail there are known. While<br />\nthe work is in no sense hampered,<br />\nstill the want of greater room and<br />\nmore facilities is being forced upon<br />\nthe attention of the instructors by<br />\nthe crowded condition. Professor<br />\nJones was quite emphatic on this<br />\npoint, and declared the need for<br />\nexpansion was becoming imperative.<br />\n\"The growth of our department,\" he concluded, \"can be attributed to nothing but our work.<br />\nOur effort is to make our results<br />\nspeak for themselves.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Burgan in Charge.<br />\n<br />\nOne of the most important departments of the University is the<br />\nnew Training School for future<br />\nmanagers, recently opened with Dr.<br />\nHarry C. Burgan at its head. This<br />\ndepartment is expected to be of the<br />\ngreatest service to the student<br />\nbody, as capable managers were<br />\nbecoming scarce. The selection of<br />\nDr. Burgan as head of the department will go a long ways towards<br />\nmaking it successful. He is fully<br />\nconversant with all the intricacies<br />\npertaining to a managership, having spent the better part of his lifetime in managerial research work.<br />\nAn unusually large enrollment is<br />\nexpected in this department, as Dr.<br />\nBurgan agrees to secure positions<br />\nfor all his graduates.

During that time, the actions of the aforesaid elevator have<br />\nbeen very unusual.

XV, NO. 3.<br />\nHOBOKENITES HUMBLE HOPKINS<br />\nBlaclCand Blue Gridiron Gladiators Play<br />\nPoorly and Lose Fumbles<br />\nWere Frequent.<br /><br />\nIn a poor exhibition of football<br />\nthe Hopkins football team went<br />\nclown to defeat at the hands of the<br />\nStevens' eleven, 2 to o, Saturday<br />\nafternoon at Homewood. Stevens<br />\nseemed to be able to go through<br />\nthe Hopkins line at will, and repeatedly carried the ball to within<br />\nseveral yards of the Hopkins goal<br />\nline. The one bright spot in the<br />\nHopkins play was the way the<br />\nBlack and Blue held its opponents<br />\nunder the shadow of its own goal<br />\nposts. Three times Stevens advanced the pigskin within less than<br />\nten yards of the Hopkins goal line,<br />\nonly to be held for downs. Buttfield, the Stevens quarter, showed<br />\npoor judgment in always trying to<br />\nmake the required distance on the<br />\nthird down, and not trying a dropkick when directly in front of the<br />\ngoal posts. In the last quarter, a<br />\ndropkick would have been worth<br />\nas much to the visitors as a touchdown.<br />\nForward passes were worked successfully by SteArens, directly over<br />\nthe line of scrimmage. Many of<br />\nthem should have been blocked by<br />\nHopkins. Both sides made so many<br />\nfumbles that the spectators' were<br />\nprepared for almost anything. The<br />\nHopkins line will have to be<br />\nstrengthened. The guard positions<br />\nespecially seemed to be weak spots.<br />\nPenniman's absence is severely felt<br />\nby Hopkins.

His work under the circumstances was good, and be will<br />\ngreatly strengthen the team in the<br />\nrest of the games this season.<br />\nThe Hopkins players tackled poorly. Their object appeared to be to<br />\ngrab their opponents by the ears, if<br />\nPossible, instead of tackling low, as<br />\nthey should have done. Poor tackling on the part of the Black and<br />\nBlue several times enabled the<br />\nStevens back to advance 8 or 10<br />\nyards after being tackled,<br />\nPieper caught the ball on the<br />\nkick-off and advanced it to Hopkins<br />\n3o-yard line. On the second<br />\nplay Gillet carried the pigskin well<br />\ninto the midfield on a forward pass.<br />\nStevens held Hopkins for downs<br />\nand secured the spheroid. It changed<br />\nhands several times before the<br />\nend of the quarter. Harris tried a<br />\ndrop kick, but failed. The quarter<br />\nended with Hopkins in possession<br />\nof the ball on its 14-yard line.

Twice in the last<br />\nperiod of play Stevens advanced<br />\nthe pigskin within striking distance<br />\nof the goal line, but were held by<br />\nthe Black and Blue. Gillet booted<br />\nthe ball out of danger the first time,<br />\nbut on his second attempt the line<br />\nheld poorly.

The<br />\nsophomores and freshmen lined up<br />\non the gridiron about.twenty yards<br />\napart, and at the sound of the<br />\nwhistle blown by Chief Judge<br />\nHarold B. Hering they rushed for<br />\neach other.<br />\nThe rush consisted of three<br />\nrounds of one minute each. At<br />\nthe end of that time the class having<br />\nthe least number of members on<br />\nthe ground was adjudged the winner. Contrary to expectations,<br />\nthe judges allowed the members of<br />\neach class who showed up to take<br />\npart. It had been understood that<br />\nthe sides were to be equal. The<br />\nfreshmen had about forty-five combatants and the sophomores thirty.<br />\nIn spite of the overwhelming<br />\nodds, the sophs put up a gallant<br />\nfight, and actually succeeded in<br />\nwinning one out of the three<br />\nrounds. The freshmen deserve<br />\ngreat credit for getting such a<br />\nlarge majority of the members of<br />\ntheir class to take part in the rush.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nMANY SPECIMENS SECURED<br /><br />\n\"THE SCHOLAR IN POLITICS\"<br /><br />\nBiologists Had Interesting and Profitable<br />\nSummer at Marine Laboratory and<br />\nin Mountains of Jamaica.<br /><br />\nWoodrow Wilson, Graduate of This University, Making Strong Fight for<br />\nGubernatorial Chair.<br /><br />\nThe history of the relations of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University with<br />\nthe island of Jamaica is long and<br />\ninteresting. It is now nearly<br />\ntwenty years since the late Professor Brooks established the first laboratory on the southern shore of<br />\nthe island, a few miles from Kingston. Work was carried on in this<br />\nlaboratory for many years, but Professor Brooks was not entirely satisfied with the location, because of<br />\ntrade winds which blow almost incessantly and make work on marine<br />\nanimals difficult. It was then that<br />\nProfessor Andrews circled the island (it is 150 miles long and 50<br />\nmiles wide), largely on foot, to find<br />\na better site for a marine laboratory. He found that Montego Bay,<br />\non the northwestern coast, was excellently adapted to work on marine<br />\nanimals. The coast line is fringed<br />\nby mountains 1500 to 2000 feet in<br />\nheight, which rise to an altitude of<br />\na mile in the interior of the island.<br />\nThe bay is therefore well protected<br />\nfrom the trade winds and it is possible to venture far out in an open<br />\nboat without danger of being<br />\nswamped. At this time, however,<br />\nMontego Bay was very difficult of<br />\naccess. There were no boat lines<br />\nrunning there, and there was no<br />\nrailroad from Kingston. So the<br />\nchange of location could not be<br />\nmade at the time.<br />\nThis year, however, an expedition was organized under auspicious circumstances. It was the first<br />\nexpedition since the disastrous one<br />\nto Port Antonio (on the northeast<br />\ncoast) in 19o1, when Professors<br />\nHumphrey and Conant lost their<br />\nlives through yellow fever. In the<br />\nperiod since Professor Andrews'<br />\nfirst visit to Montego Bay, regular<br />\nboat service has been established<br />\nbetween this town and Baltimore,<br />\nPhiladelphia and New York, and<br />\nthe railroad to Kingston has been<br />\ncompleted, making communication<br />\nwith the rest of the island a simple<br />\nmatter.<br />\nThe expedition went in two sections; the botanists leaving May II,<br />\nwhereas the zoologists did not go<br />\nuntil June. The memEers of the<br />\nparty were: Professor Andrews,<br />\nDr. Graves, Dr. Cowles, Messrs.<br />\nWilson, Givler, Middleton, and<br />\nLund; Prof. Johnson and Messrs.<br />\nYork. Brown, and Sharp. The<br />\nbotanists, under Prof. Johnson,<br />\nspent the greater part of the time<br />\nhigh up in the mountains, while the<br />\nzoologists, with Prof. Andrews,<br /><br />\nHopkins is too young to have<br />\nmany famous graduates, and the<br />\ntheory in education which the University has stood for has been of<br />\nsuch a character that the men who<br />\nchose to come here and study have<br />\nnot, as a rule, entered those vocations in which it is easiest to<br />\nachieve fame. If the roster of those<br />\nHopkins alumni who hold important professorial and scientific positions were gone over, it would be<br />\nfound that we stand second to none.<br />\nBut the men whom the public gets<br />\nto know easiest are the politicians,<br />\nthe statesmen, and the candidates<br />\nfor office. But among these public<br />\nfigures, many of whom are being<br />\nmentioned as presidential possibilities, is a Democratic candidate for<br />\ngovernor,- a Hopkins man who is<br />\nmaking a good fight, with fine<br />\nchances for success, and is rallying<br />\nto his support as a political leader,<br />\na vast following.<br />\nStarting out in life as a lawyer,<br />\nand then deciding that his vocation<br />\nlay in educational lines, and preparing himself for this work by coming<br />\nto Hopkins, Woodrow Wilson, now<br />\ncandidate for governor on the Democratic ticket in New Jersey, is the<br />\nmost illustrious example today of<br />\nthe muth-discussed scholar in politics, and is without doubt Hopkins'<br />\nmost famous alumnus. With his elevation to the presidency of Princeton University he came near being the most famous educator, as<br />\nwell as one of the greatest scholars<br />\nwhich the University had produced; but in his new role which<br />\nhe essays without solicitation on<br />\nhis part, and only on the united<br />\nrequest of the Democrats of New<br />\nJersey, he is one of the great public<br />\nfigures of the day, with presidential<br />\npossibilities which, when the next<br />\nconvention is held, will have to be<br />\nlooked out for.<br />\nThe information possessed by the<br />\nordinary voter relative to candidates for office is, we may say, of<br />\ntwo kinds. With a man who has<br />\nhad an interesting and almost fantastic life, as had Lincoln, the<br />\npeople know more of his personal<br />\nhistory than they do of what he<br />\nstands for, or his mental attainments and capacity concerning political problems. But with Wilson,<br />\nthe case is different.

Among<br />\nthe many interesting objects was<br />\na live lizard a foot and a half or<br />\ntwo feet long,'which weighed ten<br />\npounds. Unfortunately, it died last<br />\nweek. When .Columbus came to<br />\nAmerica, there were a great many<br />\n,of these lizards in Jamaica, but now<br />\nthey have almost entirely disappeared. The disappearance of this<br />\nspecies of lizard is due principally<br />\nto the mongoose. The mongoose<br />\nwas originally imported from India<br />\nfor the purpose .of destroying the<br />\nnts, which are a great pest on the<br />\nisland. But the rats were at work<br />\nwhile the mongoose slept; and,<br />\nmoreover, a mongoose cannot climb<br />\na tree, .which is a simple problem<br />\nfor the Jamaican rat. The result<br />\nwas that the mongoose turned elsewhere for a living, and is doing<br />\nmore damage than the rats formerly did.<br />\nA large number of hermit, crabs<br />\nwere brought back and are now<br />\nkept alive in the biological laboratory.

Coming to this country, he<br />\nreceived his collegiate education at<br />\nHope College, and from that institution came to the Romance department of the Hopkins. He received<br />\nhis degree in 1888, and immediately<br />\ntook a position in the faculty of<br />\n*Bowdoin College.

Jones, professor of physical chemistry. Both<br />\nundergraduates and graduate students are taking chemistry in numbers previously unknown in the<br />\ndepartment. More than 150 separate students are enrolled in the<br />\ndifferent classes or doing special<br />\nwork in the laboratories. There<br />\nare more than 40 graduates who<br />\nare making chemistry their major,<br />\nand of these more than 30 are<br />\nregularly entered as candidates for<br />\nthe degree of doctor of philosophy<br />\nin this department.<br />\nThat such a number of students<br />\novertaxes the provisions of the<br />\nlaboratories goes without saying<br />\nwhen the conditions that usually<br />\nprevail there are known. While<br />\nthe work is in no sense hampered,<br />\nstill the want of greater room and<br />\nmore facilities is being forced upon<br />\nthe attention of the instructors by<br />\nthe crowded condition. Professor<br />\nJones was quite emphatic on this<br />\npoint, and declared the need for<br />\nexpansion was becoming imperative.<br />\n\"The growth of our department,\" he concluded, \"can be attributed to nothing but our work.<br />\nOur effort is to make our results<br />\nspeak for themselves.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Burgan in Charge.<br /><br />\nOne of the most important departments of the University is the<br />\nnew Training School for future<br />\nmanagers, recently opened with Dr.<br />\nHarry C.
