We<br />\ncome because it is a place to<br />\ntake a deserved break, buy a<br />\nrelatively inexpensive snack or<br />\nreviving drink, and converse with<br />\nfriends--a seemingly trivial, yet<br />\nprofoundly important element<br />\nof daily life. The Coffee Shop's<br />\nsuccess has been wildly hailed by<br />\nevery branch of the University<br />\n(with the exception of ARA).<br />\nAll of this was once rather<br />\nuplifting, before the very essence<br />\nof the Shop was taken away<br />\nfrom us.<br />\nasked a fellow student<br />\nhow he was coping with the<br />\n<br />\nvacuum. \"My nerves are shot.<br />\nI used to meet with my friends<br />\nhere every day after class; we<br />\nwould sit around the table and<br />\ntalk for hours. Now...we never<br />\nsee each other, and have all<br />\ndrifted apart. I eat my pound<br />\ncake these days in a dusty niche<br />\nunder one of the stairwells.\"<br />\nA professor, standing in line for<br />\nhis coffee, was equally despondent. \"When I came to<br />\nHopkins, this was unheard of.\"<br />\nHe gestures with his chocolate<br />\nchip cookie to the naked expanse of checkered linoleum.<br />\n\"The main reason I came here<br />\nwas because I heard how great<br />\nthe Coffee Shop was, how<br />\ntheir<br />\nexchanged<br />\neverybody<br />\nideas, vented their passions<br />\nthere, laughed and loved over<br />\nsimple yet filling pastries. No<br />\nmore. I'm seriously thinking of<br />\nleaving this place.

Seated at the<br />\nhead of the table in a seminar<br />\nroom, I was straining to remain<br />\nattentive to an eminent professor lecturing to me from the<br />\nblackboard while simultaneously \u2022<br />\ndelivering my own lecture to a<br />\ngroup of reluctant undergraduates all staring at me with<br />\nlistless, bloodshot eyes. When I<br />\nspoke, the professor glared;<br />\nwhen I listened, my students<br />\ngiggled; while all around the<br />\nroom the 400-plus pages of my<br />\ndissertation on ancient numismatics were being blown around<br />\nin hectic circles before disappearing through an open door...<br />\nWhen I awoke, I was profusely grateful to discover that I<br />\nwas still only an undergraduate.<br />\nI could not extinguish the<br />\nfearful memory of my dream,<br />\nhowever, and during the next<br />\nfew days I found myself peering<br />\nwith renewed interest at those<br />\nfleeting, bearded figures in the<br />\nhalls of Gilman who I knew for a<br />\nfact to be graduate students.<br />\nWho are these people? I asked<br />\nmyself.<br />\nAnd what are they<br />\ndoing here? Where are they<br />\ngoing? Since no one I knew<br />\ncould answer these questions, I<br />\nresolved to find out.<br />\nMy preliminary investigations were fruitless, for as I soon<br />\ndiscovered, grads are not like<br />\nother students. They are forbidden to belong to most campus<br />\norganizations, and consequently<br />\ndo not exist for (or work on the<br />\nstaff of) the News-Letter. You<br />\nnever see them in the Rat. Some<br />\nof them work in the Hut oc-<br />\n<br />\ncasionally, but not at night. I<br />\nwas unable to gain admittance to<br />\nthe Grad Club on Friday, where<br />\nI have been told they band<br />\ntogether in total privacy, doubtless to perform some dark,<br />\nmysterious rite.<br />\nTrue, they<br />\nconsume an inordinate quantity<br />\nof coffee and doughnuts, accounting for fully half the<br />\nnormal line at the Gilman Coffee<br />\nShop, but having made their<br />\npurchases all but a few of them<br />\nhurriedly vanish, allowing only a<br />\nmomentary glimpse of their<br />\nhorned rim glasses and worn<br />\ntweed jackets, their shiny briefcases and smartly tailored feminine three-pice suits.<br />\nStymied in my effort at<br />\nobtaining information through<br />\nthe usual channels, I turned to<br />\nthe university catalogue for help.<br />\n\"Graduate students find that<br />\ntheir academic and social lives<br />\ntend to center around their<br />\ndepartments,\" it declared. This<br />\nwas very perplexing to me,since<br />\nI had always imagined that<br />\n\"departments\" were populated<br />\nwith \"professors.\" Grad students, on the other hand, were<br />\nstudents... weren't they? Suddenly, I realized my error: a<br />\ngraduate is not really a student,<br />\nbut rather a college professor<br />\nstruggling to be born.<br />\nI will expand on this definition shortly: for now, consider<br />\nthe vast gulf that separates<br />\nprofessors from undergraduates.<br />\nFor no matter how impossibly<br />\ndense the former, or how<br />\nintelligent the latter, the professor is always cast in the<br />\nauthoritative role of \"teacher,\"<br />\nlecturing to or mediating under-<br />\n<br />\ngraduates who, presumably,<br />\nlearn from him. The professors<br />\nseem comfortable with their<br />\nauthorit, the undergraduates<br />\nare content to be subordinate,<br />\nand role definition, at least in<br />\nthe classroom, is never a problem.<br />\nWith the grad student, it is<br />\nmore complicated. He must<br />\nboth learn and teach, submit to<br />\nprofessors while dominating<br />\nundergraduates, at a time when<br />\nneither role is altogether satisfactory.<br />\nFor if he anticipates<br />\ngetting hired, he must concentrate less on assimilating knowledge from the professor than on<br />\nseeing how that knowledge may<br />\nbe reworded; beginning with his<br />\ndissertation, he must learn to<br />\nproduce \"criticism\" or \"research\" and to continue producing it indefinitely, or at least<br />\nuntil he be granted tenure. This<br />\nis known as \"publish or perish;\"<br />\nits initial effect is to induce a<br />\ngnawing uncertainty in graduate<br />\nstudents who are only beginning<br />\nto adjust from their relatively<br />\ncarefree days as undergraduates.<br />\nWhich ties in with another<br />\nproblem: not all undergraduates<br />\nappreciate being taught by someone only a couple of years their<br />\nsenior. They do not respect the<br />\ngrad student as they do the<br />\nprofessor; if the grad wishes to<br />\nacquire this respect he most<br />\nforcibly dissociate himself from<br />\nhis familiar role as student and<br />\npractice making pronouncements with the ringing authority<br />\nthat is supposedly characteristic<br />\nof the prof.<br />\nThe graduate student, then,<br />\ncont. on p. 6<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nGoucher Freshman<br />\nRaped On Campus<br />\nBY LAURA ROSENTHAL<br />\n<br />\nto use the path leading to<br />\nTowson Plaza, since a man had<br />\nA Goucher Freshman was exposed himself to a student<br />\nraped at approximately 1:00 am there earlier in the year.

Local control<br />\nof school systems, and local<br />\nfunding based on taxes have led<br />\nto poor educational facilities in<br />\ncities as compared with suburbs,<br />\nhe explained, adding that the<br />\ntwo-thirds of the US population<br />\nthat lives in cities gets an inadequate education. Muller noted<br />\nthat many of these young adults<br />\noperate expensive radar sets and<br />\nother defense equipment which<br />\ntaxes pay for.<br />\nMuller's fourth point was<br />\nthe amount of time wasted in<br />\nthe US educational system,<br />\nwhich he called the \"Gilmari<br />\nSyndrome\". Named after the<br />\nfirst president of JHU, the<br />\nsyndrome goes back to when<br />\nGilman adapted the German idea<br />\nof an advanced research institution to fit into the existing<br />\neducational system, Muller said.<br />\nMixing the two ideas resulted in<br />\nthe present system which a<br />\nstudent must go through 12<br />\nyears of schooling and 4 years of<br />\ncollegiate studies if he seeks<br />\nhigher education, and must<br />\nspend an additional 3 to 4 years<br />\nif he pursues graduate studies.<br />\nAccording to Muller, not only is<br />\nmuch of this time wasted<br />\nbecause of overlap of material,<br />\nbut students are placed in a peer<br />\ngroup that is lax on discipline at<br />\na time when they need it most.<br />\nMuller concluded that we<br />\nare getting about as much out of<br />\nour educational system as we<br />\nput in. More equitable funding<br />\nwould improve the quality of<br />\neducation, he said, and if parents<br />\ntook a greater interest in their<br />\nchildren's studies, perhaps children would take more pride in<br />\nwhat they learn. Providing a<br />\ngood education to as many<br />\npeople as possible is very important in a society that depends<br />\n<br />\non individuals being aware and<br />\nable to make choices, he added.<br />\nFinally, Muller said our<br />\nsociety started as a group of<br />\nself-confident individuals who<br />\nset up institutions to help<br />\nthemselves. He contended that<br />\nwe have come to rely on institutions so much that we are losing<br />\nour self-confidence. He ended<br />\nhis talk by encouraging parents<br />\nto take interest instead of<br />\nlending their children to schools<br />\nand letting them handle the<br />\nentire educational process.<br />\n<br />\nPOLICE artBLOTTER<br />\nBY DEBORAH JONES<br />\nLARCENY:<br />\nA student<br />\nreturned to her apartment<br />\nin Wolman Hall October 5<br />\nto find her wallet, containing $61, stolen.<br />\nThe<br />\ndoor was left unlocked.<br />\nLARCENY: A men's blue<br />\n26-inch bicycle valued at $25<br />\nwas stolen from the rack in<br />\nfront of Levering Hall.

This may explain<br />\nwhy so many grad students are<br />\nsuch faithful patrons of Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop: they are expected<br />\nto hover around their departments, but they do not have<br />\noffices there, and there is a limit<br />\nto the number of times one can<br />\nunpretentiously drop in to take<br />\na look at one's mailbox.

Dark,<br />\nintelligent eyes nestle above her high cheeks.<br />\n\"May I read you something?\" I ask.<br />\n\"Please do,\" I have her reply.<br />\nI saunter to the bookshelves part of me<br />\nand select a book of the nineteenth century<br />\nEnglish poetry part of me from the leather<br />\nbound volumes.<br />\nBack in my high-backed chair, I slip on<br />\nthe narrow reading glasses part of me and begin<br />\nto recite a pastoral love poem.

A second hand joins its fellow. I<br />\nstride across the room and peer over the line of<br />\ntense fingers at the friend part of me.<br />\n\"I hope you left a little life in our ladyfriend,\" he says. Several jagged scars criss-cross<br />\nthe creases of his face. He pulls himself high<br />\nenough to see inside. \"Will you look at that...\"<br />\nI do. Elizabeth lies across the length of<br />\nthe couch part of me, toying with the loose bow<br />\nof her bikini top. She slowly curls her index<br />\nfinger.<br />\nAs the friend part of meis poised for the<br />\nfinal heave, I knee his hands and push down<br />\non his head.

The high collar of her matching blouse<br />\naccentuates the Classical line of her neck.<br />\n\"Excuse me,\" I gasp, loosening the rest of my<br />\ntie. I step into the bathroom part of me. While<br />\nspiffing up in the mirror part of me, I look<br />\nforward to a romantic evening of firelight and<br />\nDom Perignon. The bow tie conies out all<br />\nwrong, so I retie it, but this time it's even worse.<br />\nI realize that I usually wear a clip-on. A delicate<br />\nknock beckons me away from the mirror part of<br />\nme.<br />\nBehind the door, I find the friend part of<br />\nme with his shirt torn and streaked with mud,<br />\nbut his grin as wide as ever.<br />\n\"Didn't want you to miss all the fun.\" He<br />\njabs his thumb over his shoulder.<br />\nElizabeth's bare back is visible above the<br />\narm of the couch.<br />\n\"Cad,\" I mutter. I grab his collar and<br />\ndrag him to the toilet part of me. I push him in,<br />\nfolding him at the waist, bending the arms and<br />\nlegs inwards. His mouth forms a round hole of<br />\nsurprise as I flush. The toilet part of me jams,<br />\nso I grab the plunger and poke him down with<br />\nthe handle, his body giving way like a rank<br />\nmound of baloney. With an explosive pop, he<br />\nwhirls from view. A soggy sneaker is regurgitated and floats about in the rising water of the<br />\nbowl.<br />\nElizabeth sips from a china teacup. Her<br />\nroyal blue dress falls in great folds to the floor<br />\nand buttons up to a lacy frill at her chin. The<br />\noil lamp's light catches the soft down by her<br />\nears, the reddish highlights in her taut hair now<br />\ntied back in a bun.<br />\n\"May I read you from scripture?\" I ask.<br />\nShe nods, a gracious, close-mouthed smile<br />\n<br />\nlingering on her alabaster face.<br />\nI place my pince-nez gently, open the<br />\nBible part of me, and read. As the evening<br />\nslowly passes, I wonder how I will move us into<br />\nthe moonlit bedroom, when I will delve into the<br />\nultramarine fastness of her feminine mysteries.<br />\nMy voice recites the monotonous passages in<br />\ntime with the clock part of me on the mantle.<br />\nElizabeth, as stiff and erect as ever, is a tireless<br />\nlistener, while I slump deeper into the sagging<br />\ncushions, the shadow of the chair back falling<br />\nover the Bible part of me.<br />\nI should get up, leap to her side, cover her<br />\nmouth with mine, but the Bible part of me lies<br />\nin my lap like a blacksmith's anvil, mashing me<br />\ninto the huge chair part of me. The cushions<br />\ncontinue to yield, threatening to swallow me<br />\ninto their dark clay. I begin to regret my rash<br />\nactions of the day.<br />\nA raucous honking jerks me to my feet. I<br />\nlook out the window to where a yellow taxi<br />\nglows in the shower of the street light.<br />\nI open the drawer in the coffee table and<br />\n<br />\ndraw out the snub-nosed revolver part o me.<br />\nHe opens the door part of me, slime dripping<br />\nfrom his matted hair and clinging jeans.<br />\n\"Put it away,\" he says sternly.<br />\nI obey because I need him.<br />\n\"It's time we got down to business,\" he<br />\nsays. He marches us into the bedroom part of<br />\nme.<br />\nElizabeth leaps into the wide quilted bed,<br />\nher clothes fading from her before she bounces<br />\nto a stop. The friend part of me and I undress.<br />\nOur clothes are dropped into a tangled pile, his<br />\nragged shirt slithering over my jacket, his sodden<br />\njeans staining my vest.<br />\nWe crawl. on to the bed from either<br />\ncorner, aiming along the lines of Elizabeth's<br />\n_spread legs, climbing those smooth ivory<br />\nbranches toward the shapely boles and curves<br />\nof her trunk. I have her grab the private part of<br />\nme. I swim over her sleek skin, the puffy quilts<br />\nwashing over us in cottony waves. My unshaven<br />\nface clings to her loose veils of hair. I look to<br />\neither side and note the disappearance of the<br />\nfriend part of me, swept away in the stormy<br />\nswell of the bedclothes. Now I am alone with<br />\nthe woman part of me.<br />\nWe continue our grasping embraces and<br />\nburrow deep into the entangling mounds of<br />\ncloth. The dim moonlight fades to complete<br />\nblack. I thrust against the cushion of her thighs,<br />\ninhale her pine scent, rub the wool below her<br />\nsilken belly. The roaring bellows of my breath<br />\nfills my head. I surface, gasping in crisp night air.<br />\nI reach for Elizabeth, but my hand only encounters unnatural percale, lifeless pillows, a crumpled blanket smelling of my own sweat.

But he adds,\"you can only write<br />\nwhat you know.\"<br />\nThat's the kind of eliptical statement<br />\nan author can make when he is 65 years<br />\nold, and has told his story many times<br />\nand in many different ways. Miller's<br />\nstory is a simple one, and in the past it<br />\nhas appeared in simple forms. There is a<br />\nfamily\u2014 a \u2022father, broken by loss of<br />\nfortune and respectability, and his sons,<br />\ncaught between their sense of duty to<br />\nhim, and their need to live their own<br />\nFine shadings in perspective,<br />\nlives.<br />\ncharacter, and detail have yielded All My<br />\nSons, View From the Bridge, Death of a<br />\nSalesman, and The Price- -a wide range of<br />\nvery different works on the same theme.<br />\nyet each a product of what the author<br />\nknows.<br />\nThere is no question that The American Clock is the \"most different\" of<br />\nMiller's plays in this vein\u2014 so different, in<br />\nfact, that it might not readily be recognized as being \"in this vein.\"<br />\nPerhaps time has softened Miller's<br />\nfeelings about the conflicts in his family,<br />\nfor he has, for once, chosen not to focus<br />\non the question of blame, guilt, and<br />\npersonal obsession within the family. To<br />\nbe sure, there is a father, brought to<br />\nruin by the Great Depression, and his son,<br />\nbut The American Clock , as Miller says,<br />\n\"is not about conflict. It's possible to<br />\nhave a father and son without conflict.\"<br />\nMiller has stepped back from the family,<br />\nand instead written a play that is primarily about the Depression. The Baum<br />\nfamily, whose progress we follow throughout the play, is portrayed as a typical<br />\nvictim of that period, and their story is a<br />\nmore general, less personally told story.<br />\n\"I regard the Depression, along with<br />\nthe Civil War, as the most important<br />\nperiod in our history,\" Miller told critics<br />\nat a recent press conference. \"The<br />\ncountry went through profound changes,<br />\nthe effects of which we are still feeling.\"<br />\ndifferences<br />\nThe play's other radical<br />\n<br />\nBaums enough to be truly moved by their<br />\nplight, and do the insights and memories<br />\nof Lee have an impact on us? Is Miller,<br />\nwho has complained of the proliferation<br />\nof \"purely mimetic exercises\"on the<br />\nstage, guilty of having written a play that<br />\nis too facile?<br />\nThe American Clock can withstand<br />\nsuch charges, provided that one does not<br />\nexpect it to make profound and sweeping<br />\nstatements about the Depression, nor to<br />\nrepresent a full spectrum of the American<br />\nexperience during that time. It is a play<br />\nfor and about the middle class. Lee<br />\nBaum says of his father: \"He was the<br />\nkind of man that, when he raised his<br />\nhand, I knew there would instantly be a<br />\ncab,\" and of his mother: \"She was like<br />\nthe best and worst of this country.

The team has scored<br />\nonly two goals in nine regular<br />\nseason matches after going scoreless in four preseason scrimmages.<br />\nAccording to Mohammad<br />\nAli, who last year scored twelve<br />\nof the team's fourteen goals, a<br />\nlack of intensity has caused<br />\nthe Blue Jays' downfall.

Against Kutztown,<br />\nOctober 8, the Jays led 1-0<br />\nat the half on a goal by Chris<br />\nMcShane and it appeared that<br />\nHopkins was going to end its<br />\nlosing streak at four. However,<br />\nthe Jays were unable to make<br />\nthe goal stand up. In the second<br />\nhalf, the Jays were completely<br />\n<br />\nflat, offensively and defensively,<br />\nas Kutztown struck back,<br />\npouring three straight goals into<br />\nthe Hopkins net.

The<br />\nonly other scheduled game,<br />\nagainst Catholic University, was<br />\npostponed on account of rain<br />\nand is scheduled to be replayed<br />\nhere at Homewood on Monday<br />\nat 4:30 pm.<br />\nThe Jays have upped their<br />\nrecord to 2-2-1, leveling off for<br />\nwhat looks to be one of the few<br />\nwinning seasons at JHU this fall.<br />\nThe key to the success of<br />\n<br />\nthe 1980 squad seems to be<br />\nmore speed on the attack,<br />\nsomething which has been<br />\nlacking in the teams of the past.<br />\nThe use of passing ahead and<br />\nfewer loose balls and turnovers<br />\nhave all contributed to the<br />\nteam.s ability to control the ball<br />\nfor the major portion of the<br />\ngame. Even in the loss to<br />\nGoucher the Hopkins women<br />\nmanaged to control the ball,<br />\nalthough were defeated by several good breakaway shots which<br />\ncaught the defensive backs<br />\nunprepared.<br />\nOn the offense, Hopkins is<br />\ncurrently led in scoring by<br />\nsophomore Ellen Abramson,<br />\nwho had a goal in each of the<br />\n<br />\nthree contests in which the team<br />\nhas scored. Adding a goal in the<br />\nTrinity contest was freshmen<br />\nMonique Muri, and against Gallaudet the second score came<br />\nfrom Joanne Engler, a senior<br />\nhalfback who has returned after<br />\nan absence of several years.<br />\nExcept for the loss to<br />\nGoucher, the Hopkins defense<br />\nhas yielded only three goals<br />\nin four games, and has racked up<br />\ntwo shutouts. Defensive statistics like this indicate one of<br />\ntwo things:<br />\neither the goal<br />\nkeeper is making many saves, or<br />\nthe backfield is preventing the<br />\noffense from penetrating. In the<br />\ncase of Hopkins, both strategies<br />\nare being employed.<br />\n\"The<br />\n<br />\nbackfield has been able to take<br />\nthe ball away and send it upfield, but (goalie) Wendy Atkinson has been there to make<br />\nthe plays and bolster the defense, even if she hasn't had to<br />\nmake the saves,\" says coach<br />\nMicul Ann Morse.<br />\nNeedless to say, a goalie's<br />\njob is much more than simply<br />\n\"blocking\" the goal.

We<br />\ncome because it is a place to<br />\ntake a deserved break, buy a<br />\nrelatively inexpensive snack or<br />\nreviving drink, and converse with<br />\nfriends--a seemingly trivial, yet<br />\nprofoundly important element<br />\nof daily life. The Coffee Shop's<br />\nsuccess has been wildly hailed by<br />\nevery branch of the University<br />\n(with the exception of ARA).<br />\nAll of this was once rather<br />\nuplifting, before the very essence<br />\nof the Shop was taken away<br />\nfrom us.<br />\nasked a fellow student<br />\nhow he was coping with the<br /><br />\nvacuum. \"My nerves are shot.<br />\nI used to meet with my friends<br />\nhere every day after class; we<br />\nwould sit around the table and<br />\ntalk for hours.

Seated at the<br />\nhead of the table in a seminar<br />\nroom, I was straining to remain<br />\nattentive to an eminent professor lecturing to me from the<br />\nblackboard while simultaneously \u2022<br />\ndelivering my own lecture to a<br />\ngroup of reluctant undergraduates all staring at me with<br />\nlistless, bloodshot eyes. When I<br />\nspoke, the professor glared;<br />\nwhen I listened, my students<br />\ngiggled; while all around the<br />\nroom the 400-plus pages of my<br />\ndissertation on ancient numismatics were being blown around<br />\nin hectic circles before disappearing through an open door...<br />\nWhen I awoke, I was profusely grateful to discover that I<br />\nwas still only an undergraduate.<br />\nI could not extinguish the<br />\nfearful memory of my dream,<br />\nhowever, and during the next<br />\nfew days I found myself peering<br />\nwith renewed interest at those<br />\nfleeting, bearded figures in the<br />\nhalls of Gilman who I knew for a<br />\nfact to be graduate students.<br />\nWho are these people? I asked<br />\nmyself.<br />\nAnd what are they<br />\ndoing here? Where are they<br />\ngoing? Since no one I knew<br />\ncould answer these questions, I<br />\nresolved to find out.<br />\nMy preliminary investigations were fruitless, for as I soon<br />\ndiscovered, grads are not like<br />\nother students.

This<br />\nwas very perplexing to me,since<br />\nI had always imagined that<br />\n\"departments\" were populated<br />\nwith \"professors.\" Grad students, on the other hand, were<br />\nstudents... weren't they? Suddenly, I realized my error: a<br />\ngraduate is not really a student,<br />\nbut rather a college professor<br />\nstruggling to be born.<br />\nI will expand on this definition shortly: for now, consider<br />\nthe vast gulf that separates<br />\nprofessors from undergraduates.<br />\nFor no matter how impossibly<br />\ndense the former, or how<br />\nintelligent the latter, the professor is always cast in the<br />\nauthoritative role of \"teacher,\"<br />\nlecturing to or mediating under-<br /><br />\ngraduates who, presumably,<br />\nlearn from him. The professors<br />\nseem comfortable with their<br />\nauthorit, the undergraduates<br />\nare content to be subordinate,<br />\nand role definition, at least in<br />\nthe classroom, is never a problem.<br />\nWith the grad student, it is<br />\nmore complicated. He must<br />\nboth learn and teach, submit to<br />\nprofessors while dominating<br />\nundergraduates, at a time when<br />\nneither role is altogether satisfactory.<br />\nFor if he anticipates<br />\ngetting hired, he must concentrate less on assimilating knowledge from the professor than on<br />\nseeing how that knowledge may<br />\nbe reworded; beginning with his<br />\ndissertation, he must learn to<br />\nproduce \"criticism\" or \"research\" and to continue producing it indefinitely, or at least<br />\nuntil he be granted tenure. This<br />\nis known as \"publish or perish;\"<br />\nits initial effect is to induce a<br />\ngnawing uncertainty in graduate<br />\nstudents who are only beginning<br />\nto adjust from their relatively<br />\ncarefree days as undergraduates.<br />\nWhich ties in with another<br />\nproblem: not all undergraduates<br />\nappreciate being taught by someone only a couple of years their<br />\nsenior. They do not respect the<br />\ngrad student as they do the<br />\nprofessor; if the grad wishes to<br />\nacquire this respect he most<br />\nforcibly dissociate himself from<br />\nhis familiar role as student and<br />\npractice making pronouncements with the ringing authority<br />\nthat is supposedly characteristic<br />\nof the prof.<br />\nThe graduate student, then,<br />\ncont. on p. 6<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nGoucher Freshman<br />\nRaped On Campus<br />\nBY LAURA ROSENTHAL<br /><br />\nto use the path leading to<br />\nTowson Plaza, since a man had<br />\nA Goucher Freshman was exposed himself to a student<br />\nraped at approximately 1:00 am there earlier in the year.

Local control<br />\nof school systems, and local<br />\nfunding based on taxes have led<br />\nto poor educational facilities in<br />\ncities as compared with suburbs,<br />\nhe explained, adding that the<br />\ntwo-thirds of the US population<br />\nthat lives in cities gets an inadequate education. Muller noted<br />\nthat many of these young adults<br />\noperate expensive radar sets and<br />\nother defense equipment which<br />\ntaxes pay for.<br />\nMuller's fourth point was<br />\nthe amount of time wasted in<br />\nthe US educational system,<br />\nwhich he called the \"Gilmari<br />\nSyndrome\". Named after the<br />\nfirst president of JHU, the<br />\nsyndrome goes back to when<br />\nGilman adapted the German idea<br />\nof an advanced research institution to fit into the existing<br />\neducational system, Muller said.<br />\nMixing the two ideas resulted in<br />\nthe present system which a<br />\nstudent must go through 12<br />\nyears of schooling and 4 years of<br />\ncollegiate studies if he seeks<br />\nhigher education, and must<br />\nspend an additional 3 to 4 years<br />\nif he pursues graduate studies.<br />\nAccording to Muller, not only is<br />\nmuch of this time wasted<br />\nbecause of overlap of material,<br />\nbut students are placed in a peer<br />\ngroup that is lax on discipline at<br />\na time when they need it most.<br />\nMuller concluded that we<br />\nare getting about as much out of<br />\nour educational system as we<br />\nput in. More equitable funding<br />\nwould improve the quality of<br />\neducation, he said, and if parents<br />\ntook a greater interest in their<br />\nchildren's studies, perhaps children would take more pride in<br />\nwhat they learn. Providing a<br />\ngood education to as many<br />\npeople as possible is very important in a society that depends<br /><br />\non individuals being aware and<br />\nable to make choices, he added.<br />\nFinally, Muller said our<br />\nsociety started as a group of<br />\nself-confident individuals who<br />\nset up institutions to help<br />\nthemselves. He contended that<br />\nwe have come to rely on institutions so much that we are losing<br />\nour self-confidence. He ended<br />\nhis talk by encouraging parents<br />\nto take interest instead of<br />\nlending their children to schools<br />\nand letting them handle the<br />\nentire educational process.<br /><br />\nPOLICE artBLOTTER<br />\nBY DEBORAH JONES<br />\nLARCENY:<br />\nA student<br />\nreturned to her apartment<br />\nin Wolman Hall October 5<br />\nto find her wallet, containing $61, stolen.<br />\nThe<br />\ndoor was left unlocked.<br />\nLARCENY: A men's blue<br />\n26-inch bicycle valued at $25<br />\nwas stolen from the rack in<br />\nfront of Levering Hall.

This may explain<br />\nwhy so many grad students are<br />\nsuch faithful patrons of Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop: they are expected<br />\nto hover around their departments, but they do not have<br />\noffices there, and there is a limit<br />\nto the number of times one can<br />\nunpretentiously drop in to take<br />\na look at one's mailbox. Hutzler<br />\nis another possibility, but a<br />\nlimited one; too many appearances there can threaten to<br />\nreinforce the label of \"student\"<br />\none is so desperately trying to<br />\ntranscend.

My childhood friend Freddy<br />\nChronhardt, now a Boston cab driver, appeared<br />\nin _my office at the University last Saturday with<br />\na strange tale to tell. It seems that a passenger<br />\nwearing a black ski mask and sunglasses handed<br />\nFreddy a thick wad of bills and jumped out of<br />\nthe taxi, and on closer inspection the bills<br />\nturned out to be small pieces of green paper<br />\ncovered with the scrawled record of a man's<br />\ndream. My simple friend contemplated the<br />\ndestruction of this document in the heat of his<br />\nanger, yet nobly refrained. So he presented it to<br />\nme in the hope that I, a man of letters, would<br />\nfind it ofinterest. I did.<br />\nelnelne,<br />\nI have myself and the friend part of me<br />\nride on the ferris wheel part of me. I make the<br />\nstomach part of me quiver with excitement.<br />\nThe rainbow tents of the carnival part of me rise<br />\ncontinually to view like a holiday oceanliner on<br />\nthe swells of a heavy sea. I have the friend part<br />\nof me point things out to me and laugh. I<br />\nlaugh too. Then he sees a beautiful woman who<br />\nI clothe in a conservative, though close-fitted<br />\nblue dress.<br />\nHe whistles as I stop the ferris wheel. I<br />\nhave us join the woman part of me in front of<br />\nthe noisy shooting gallery part of me.<br />\n\"Hey, babe, want to come with us?\" I<br />\nhave the friend part of me say. He hooks his<br />\nthumb in his jeans.<br />\n\"Sure,\" I have her say.<br />\nThe friend part of me pushes through the<br />\njostling crowds part of me, heading us to the<br />\nyawning mouth of the tent part of me.<br />\n\"What's your name, lady?\" I have him call<br />\nback.<br />\n\"Elizabeth,\" I have her say.<br />\n\"Mind if I call you Liz?\" the friend part<br />\nof me asks.<br />\nI have us disappear into the gloom of the<br />\ntent part of me.<br />\nI indicate the stuffed blue frog and the<br />\nporcelain horse parts of me that I have her cradle<br />\nin her arms. \"May I carry your prizes?\" I ask.<br />\n\"Yes, please,\" I have her say.<br />\nI reach for them. Elizabeth screams,<br />\ndropping the porcelain horse. It shatters at my<br /><br />\nfeet.<br />\n\"Sorry, miss,\" the friend part of me says.<br />\nHe holds the blue frog in a large calloused hand.<br />\n\"Just wanted to help out.\"<br />\n\"Watch where you put those hands,<br />\nmister,\" I have Elizabeth say.<br />\nWe squeeze through the crowd part of me<br />\nuntil the friend part of me drags us into the<br />\ngarish' showroom part of me where the freakish<br />\nparts of me are on display cavorting under<br />\nhissing neon lights for the amusement of the<br />\nspectators part of me.<br />\n\"I don't want to stay here,\" I say.

With a<br />\nclick, the door part of me shuts out all the noise<br />\nfrom the carnival part of me. I have the white<br />\nsunlight part of me break around the hanging<br />\nplants in the picture window part of me. Elizabeth<br />\ndrifts through the room, settling delicately on<br />\nthe beige velvet couch part of me.

I<br />\nsit across from them, tugging at the knees of the<br />\ngrey flannel slacks part of me as I do to maintain<br />\nthe crease.<br />\n\"What a lovely apartment,\" I have Elizabeth say.<br />\n\"Thank you,\" I say.

As his hairy claw buzzes out of<br />\nsight along her nylons, he lowers his face to hers,<br />\nscaly lips puckered. Then the friend part of me<br />\ndisappears.<br />\nOr I should say,, then I make the friend<br />\npart of me disappear.<br />\nNow only the vibrant air part of me<br />\nseparates us. Black hair settles around her<br />\ndelicate shoulders and long white neck. Dark,<br />\nintelligent eyes nestle above her high cheeks.<br />\n\"May I read you something?\" I ask.<br />\n\"Please do,\" I have her reply.<br />\nI saunter to the bookshelves part of me<br />\nand select a book of the nineteenth century<br />\nEnglish poetry part of me from the leather<br />\nbound volumes.<br />\nBack in my high-backed chair, I slip on<br />\nthe narrow reading glasses part of me and begin<br />\nto recite a pastoral love poem. A rude knock at<br />\nthe door behind me interrupts the reading. I<br />\nnod my apologies and answer the recurrent<br />\nsummons.<br />\nThe friend part of me stands framed in<br />\nthe dark part of me that churns wildly in every<br />\ndirection behind him.<br />\n\"What sort of hanky panky's been going<br />\non here,\" he drawls, winking at me. He looks<br />\npast me. Something reflected in his eyes makes<br />\nme turn.<br />\nElizabeth now wears a short gold skirt and<br />\nhalter. Rolling her eyes, she runs her tongue<br />\nover a scarlet upper lip and pats the cushion<br />\nbeside hers.<br />\nThe friend part of me shoulders past. I<br />\ngrab him by the collar of his wool lumberjack<br />\nshirt and propel him headfirst through the<br />\npicture window part of me. The hanging plants<br />\npart of me swing in and out, catching on the<br />\njagged shards that still protrude from the frame.<br />\nI make them stop.<br />\nElizabeth joins me, back in her handsome<br />\nblue dress. \"The poor man,\" she says.

I offer her a<br />\ndrink. While I stand at the bar part of me, I<br />\nwatch as I have her elegantly cross her legs.<br />\nA thick knuckled hand grabs the shattered<br />\nwindow ledge. A second hand joins its fellow. I<br />\nstride across the room and peer over the line of<br />\ntense fingers at the friend part of me.<br />\n\"I hope you left a little life in our ladyfriend,\" he says. Several jagged scars criss-cross<br />\nthe creases of his face. He pulls himself high<br />\nenough to see inside. \"Will you look at that...\"<br />\nI do. Elizabeth lies across the length of<br />\nthe couch part of me, toying with the loose bow<br />\nof her bikini top. She slowly curls her index<br />\nfinger.<br />\nAs the friend part of meis poised for the<br />\nfinal heave, I knee his hands and push down<br />\non his head.

But he adds,\"you can only write<br />\nwhat you know.\"<br />\nThat's the kind of eliptical statement<br />\nan author can make when he is 65 years<br />\nold, and has told his story many times<br />\nand in many different ways. Miller's<br />\nstory is a simple one, and in the past it<br />\nhas appeared in simple forms. There is a<br />\nfamily\u2014 a \u2022father, broken by loss of<br />\nfortune and respectability, and his sons,<br />\ncaught between their sense of duty to<br />\nhim, and their need to live their own<br />\nFine shadings in perspective,<br />\nlives.<br />\ncharacter, and detail have yielded All My<br />\nSons, View From the Bridge, Death of a<br />\nSalesman, and The Price- -a wide range of<br />\nvery different works on the same theme.<br />\nyet each a product of what the author<br />\nknows.<br />\nThere is no question that The American Clock is the \"most different\" of<br />\nMiller's plays in this vein\u2014 so different, in<br />\nfact, that it might not readily be recognized as being \"in this vein.\"<br />\nPerhaps time has softened Miller's<br />\nfeelings about the conflicts in his family,<br />\nfor he has, for once, chosen not to focus<br />\non the question of blame, guilt, and<br />\npersonal obsession within the family. To<br />\nbe sure, there is a father, brought to<br />\nruin by the Great Depression, and his son,<br />\nbut The American Clock , as Miller says,<br />\n\"is not about conflict. It's possible to<br />\nhave a father and son without conflict.\"<br />\nMiller has stepped back from the family,<br />\nand instead written a play that is primarily about the Depression. The Baum<br />\nfamily, whose progress we follow throughout the play, is portrayed as a typical<br />\nvictim of that period, and their story is a<br />\nmore general, less personally told story.<br />\n\"I regard the Depression, along with<br />\nthe Civil War, as the most important<br />\nperiod in our history,\" Miller told critics<br />\nat a recent press conference. \"The<br />\ncountry went through profound changes,<br />\nthe effects of which we are still feeling.\"<br />\ndifferences<br />\nThe play's other radical<br /><br />\nBaums enough to be truly moved by their<br />\nplight, and do the insights and memories<br />\nof Lee have an impact on us? Is Miller,<br />\nwho has complained of the proliferation<br />\nof \"purely mimetic exercises\"on the<br />\nstage, guilty of having written a play that<br />\nis too facile?<br />\nThe American Clock can withstand<br />\nsuch charges, provided that one does not<br />\nexpect it to make profound and sweeping<br />\nstatements about the Depression, nor to<br />\nrepresent a full spectrum of the American<br />\nexperience during that time. It is a play<br />\nfor and about the middle class. Lee<br />\nBaum says of his father: \"He was the<br />\nkind of man that, when he raised his<br />\nhand, I knew there would instantly be a<br />\ncab,\" and of his mother: \"She was like<br />\nthe best and worst of this country.

The team has scored<br />\nonly two goals in nine regular<br />\nseason matches after going scoreless in four preseason scrimmages.<br />\nAccording to Mohammad<br />\nAli, who last year scored twelve<br />\nof the team's fourteen goals, a<br />\nlack of intensity has caused<br />\nthe Blue Jays' downfall. Hopkins<br />\nhas not been overmatched by its<br />\nopponents. Rather, the team<br />\nhas suffered from letdowns,<br />\ngiving up key goals.<br />\nThe Jays lost their second<br />\nand third 1-0 games of the<br />\nseason to Towson State and to<br />\nUrsinus October 1 and 4, respectively. Against Kutztown,<br />\nOctober 8, the Jays led 1-0<br />\nat the half on a goal by Chris<br />\nMcShane and it appeared that<br />\nHopkins was going to end its<br />\nlosing streak at four. However,<br />\nthe Jays were unable to make<br />\nthe goal stand up. In the second<br />\nhalf, the Jays were completely<br /><br />\nflat, offensively and defensively,<br />\nas Kutztown struck back,<br />\npouring three straight goals into<br />\nthe Hopkins net. The Blue Jays<br />\nlost 3-1.<br />\nThe story was no different<br />\nagainst Dickinson October 11 or<br />\nagainst Western Maryland October 14. The Jays dropped both<br />\ngames by 2-0 margins. The<br />\nWestern Maryland match was<br />\nessentially over after the first<br />\nfive minutes of the first half as<br />\nWestern Maryland took a 2-0<br />\nlead on two quick goals. There<br />\nwas no scoring the rest of the<br />\nway.<br />\nHopkins is a young team,<br />\ncomposed chiefly of freshmen<br />\nand sophomores. Ali has improved during the season, despite the losing streak. \"This<br />\nseason will serve as a year for<br />\ngaining experience,\" he said.<br />\nThe offense has not been coordinated and the team needs<br />\nmuch more practice.<br />\nThe<br />\ndefense has not been bad.<br />\nHowever, it too suffers from a<br />\nlack of intensity over the full 90<br />\nminutes of play.

The<br />\nonly other scheduled game,<br />\nagainst Catholic University, was<br />\npostponed on account of rain<br />\nand is scheduled to be replayed<br />\nhere at Homewood on Monday<br />\nat 4:30 pm.<br />\nThe Jays have upped their<br />\nrecord to 2-2-1, leveling off for<br />\nwhat looks to be one of the few<br />\nwinning seasons at JHU this fall.<br />\nThe key to the success of<br /><br />\nthe 1980 squad seems to be<br />\nmore speed on the attack,<br />\nsomething which has been<br />\nlacking in the teams of the past.<br />\nThe use of passing ahead and<br />\nfewer loose balls and turnovers<br />\nhave all contributed to the<br />\nteam.s ability to control the ball<br />\nfor the major portion of the<br />\ngame. Even in the loss to<br />\nGoucher the Hopkins women<br />\nmanaged to control the ball,<br />\nalthough were defeated by several good breakaway shots which<br />\ncaught the defensive backs<br />\nunprepared.<br />\nOn the offense, Hopkins is<br />\ncurrently led in scoring by<br />\nsophomore Ellen Abramson,<br />\nwho had a goal in each of the<br /><br />\nthree contests in which the team<br />\nhas scored. Adding a goal in the<br />\nTrinity contest was freshmen<br />\nMonique Muri, and against Gallaudet the second score came<br />\nfrom Joanne Engler, a senior<br />\nhalfback who has returned after<br />\nan absence of several years.<br />\nExcept for the loss to<br />\nGoucher, the Hopkins defense<br />\nhas yielded only three goals<br />\nin four games, and has racked up<br />\ntwo shutouts. Defensive statistics like this indicate one of<br />\ntwo things:<br />\neither the goal<br />\nkeeper is making many saves, or<br />\nthe backfield is preventing the<br />\noffense from penetrating. In the<br />\ncase of Hopkins, both strategies<br />\nare being employed.<br />\n\"The<br /><br />\nbackfield has been able to take<br />\nthe ball away and send it upfield, but (goalie) Wendy Atkinson has been there to make<br />\nthe plays and bolster the defense, even if she hasn't had to<br />\nmake the saves,\" says coach<br />\nMicul Ann Morse.<br />\nNeedless to say, a goalie's<br />\njob is much more than simply<br />\n\"blocking\" the goal. It requires<br />\nan ability to direct the defense<br />\nand observe the attacking<br />\nplayers as well as develop<br />\nstrategy, all of which the freshman goalie is acquiring as the<br />\nseason continues.<br />\nThe Jays face what might be<br />\ntheir toughest opponent today<br />\nat 3:00 pm on the soccer field,<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nWAWA<br />\nFOOD MARKETS<br /><br />\nNo matter how your<br />\nteam does on Saturday,<br />\nyou're a winner<br />\nat Wawa on Sunday.<br />\nHere's a delicious offer from Wawa.<br />\nNo matter how your varsity football<br />\ngame turns out this Saturday, you can<br />\ncelebrate or commiserate on Sunday<br />\nwith free coffee, tea or hot<br />\nchocolate.<br />\nBring your student ID in on Sunday<br />\nfor a free cup of coffee, tea or hot<br />\nchocolate.(One cup per student.)<br />\nWin or lose you'll always stay ahead<br />\nwhen you shop at Wawa.
