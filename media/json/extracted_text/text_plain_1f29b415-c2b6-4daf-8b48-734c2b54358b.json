No,<br />\nI can't see making this a career.<br />\nSo why do you do it?<br />\nAnother good question.<br />\nWell, basically, they leave me<br />\nalone, and they pay me.<br />\nAc titally, I consider modern<br />\nsociety so mechanized that there's<br />\na temptation to see just how far<br />\n.you can go.

Love, professor and<br />\nchairman of the Department of<br />\nBiophysics and includes Eato<br />\nLattman, a research associate,<br />\nand graduate students Keith<br />\nWard and Barry Wishner.<br />\nHemoglobin moleules, both<br />\nnormal and sickle cell, exist in<br />\ntwo states in the blood stream:<br />\noxygenated after passing through<br />\nthe lungs, and deoxygenated<br />\nafter they have released the<br />\noxygen at some point in the<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe latter is the important<br />\nstate as far as study of the<br />\ndiseased molecule is concerned.<br />\nIt is in this deoxygenated state<br />\n<br />\nthat the molecules stick together<br />\nand distort the red blood cell in<br />\nwhich they are contained. This<br />\ncauses the painful \"sickle cell<br />\ncrisis\" in sickle cell anemia. The<br />\nanemia is a hereditary disease<br />\nwhich affects approximately one<br />\nblack person in forty.<br />\nAccording to Love, electron<br />\nmicroscopy does not yield<br />\nsufficient detail to reveal the<br />\natomic structure of the molecules<br />\nand up to now,it has not been<br />\npossible to analyze them by x-ray<br />\ndiffraction because of technical<br />\ndifficulties in crystalizing<br />\ndeoxygenated sickle cell<br />\nhemoglobin. The crystalization<br />\nprocess is a prerequisite for<br />\nemployment of the x-ray<br />\ndiffraction. Love began working<br />\non the sickle cell problem nearly<br />\ntwo years ago. The research<br />\ngroup's initial success came last<br />\nyear in January when Wishner<br />\nsucceeded in growing diffraction<br />\nquality crystals of deoxygenated<br />\nsickle cell hemoglobin.

The problem was<br />\nachieved with the aid of<br />\ncomputer facilities at Hopkins<br />\nApplied Physics Lab.<br />\nLove explained that there was<br />\nan element of risk involved in the<br />\nstudy. \"It is possible<br />\nin the<br />\nprocess of crystalization,\" he<br />\n*said, \"that the hemoglobin<br />\nmolecules may be altered such<br />\nthat they no longer represent<br />\nwhat actually goes on in the<br />\nhuman blood stream.\" But Love<br />\nadded that his group was hopeful<br />\nthat in their study of the<br />\nmolecule's crystalline structure<br />\nthey will in fact come up with a<br />\ntrue picture of what the sickled<br />\nhemoglobin molecule looks like.<br />\nThe end product of the<br />\ndiffraction analysis will be a<br />\n<br />\npecora's<br />\nresturant<br />\n<br />\nYA LATER, from page 1<br />\nA meeting was held yesterday<br />\nbetween trustees of the<br />\nUniversity and the Hospital to<br />\noutline a nationwide soliciting<br />\ncampaign.

Each spring<br />\nSaturday for the past two years,<br />\nLes Matthews has performed this<br />\nritual for the Johns Hopkins Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nA graduate of St. Paul's<br />\nSchool, Matthews has been at<br />\nhome in the crease ever since the<br />\nthird grade and has become most<br />\nproficient at that position in the<br />\nfourteen intervening years. His<br />\ntalents have not gone unnoticed,<br />\ns Les was named the<br />\noutstanding collegiate goalkeeper<br />\nin the nation last year, winning<br />\nthe C. Markland Kelly Award.<br />\n\"Goalie is the most challenging<br />\nposition because you are the last<br />\nbarrier between the other team<br />\nand a score,\" stated the first<br />\nteam All-American who is a<br />\nco-captain of the 1973 Blue Jays.<br />\n\"But when you do well, it gives<br />\nyou a lot of personal<br />\nsatisfaction.\"<br />\nAt St. Paul's, Matthews was<br />\nAll-MSA goalie for two years. In<br />\n<br />\nhis senior year there, he was<br />\ncaptain of his lacrosse team, an<br />\nhonorable mention All-State<br />\nhalfback in football, and was<br />\nnamed the outstanding high<br />\nschool lacrosse player in<br />\nMaryland. In addition to<br />\ncontinuing lacrosse at Hopkins,<br />\nLes has been a housemaster,<br />\nplayed football, and is a member<br />\nof the H Club and the Phi Gam<br />\nFraternity.<br />\nHeavily recruited by several<br />\nschools, Matthews chose Hopkins<br />\nover the Ivy League for two<br />\nreasons. He felt that Hopkins<br />\noffered the best combination of<br />\nacademics and lacrosse.<br />\nMoreover, since he had seen<br />\nevery home Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\ngame while in high school, he felt<br />\nhe belonged here.<br />\nAnd he has not been<br />\ndisappointed. \"The quality of<br />\neducation at Hopkins is as good<br />\nas that of the Ivies, plus there is<br />\nmore personal contact with the<br />\nfaculty and administration,\"<br />\nenthused the natural sciences<br />\narea major.\"In addition, you can<br />\ndo as much with a degree from<br />\n<br />\nJays find diamond in<br />\nthe rough; win 16-9<br />\nup a run in the last inning, but<br />\nthe rally fell short.<br />\nWednesday afternoon the Blue<br />\nJay bats again broke out. In the<br />\nseven innings played, they rapped<br />\n15 hits for their 16 runs. Greg<br />\nOta relieved Jim Pitts and<br />\nreceived credit for the win,<br />\nthanks to an eight-run seventh<br />\ninning. Entering the fifth, the<br />\nJays were down 8-1, but they<br />\nscored 15 runs in the next three<br />\ninnings to blow the game wide<br />\nopen.<br />\nSenior outfielder Alan<br />\nPeerless, in his last game at<br />\nHomewood, came up with a<br />\nperfect day at the plate. His four<br />\nhits and a walk enabled him to<br />\nscore two runs and drive two<br />\nothers home. Shortstop Tom<br />\nPedroni socked three singles,<br />\nstole two bases and scampered<br />\nhome with three runs.<br />\nDespite Tom's and Alan's<br />\nperformances, the hitting star of<br />\nthe day had to be Mike Bogdan.<br />\nMike hit for the cycle, one of the<br />\ntruly phenomenal feats a batter<br />\ncan accomplish in a single game,<br />\nand knocked in five runs. He<br />\nsingled in the second, hit a<br />\ntwo-run homer three innings<br />\nlater, tripled in the sixth, and<br />\nIn the second game Hopkins<br />\ndoubled during the eight-run<br />\nouthit Loyola eight to six, but<br />\ninning.<br />\nseventh<br />\nof<br />\nend<br />\nshort<br />\nstill came up on the<br />\nfor the Blue Jay<br />\nProspects<br />\nopened<br />\nJays<br />\nThe<br />\nscore.<br />\nthe 5-3<br />\nbaseball team are the best they<br />\nthe scoring with two runs on five<br />\nhits in the first inning.

The Blue Jays picked. who will not be back next year.<br />\nBy STEVEN BROWN<br />\nWednesday afternoon the Blue<br />\nJay baseball team played their<br />\nwildest game of the season. The<br />\ngame was called a forfeit in the<br />\ntop of the eighth inning with<br />\nHopkins in front, 16-9. The<br />\nDickinson coach, angered by<br />\nsome earlier calls made by the<br />\nplate umpire, protested a low<br />\nstrike a little too loudly. After a<br />\nfew words with the coach, the<br />\numpire stopped the game and<br />\nawarded Hopkins the win. The<br />\nvictory was highly appreciated<br />\nafter the Jays dropped both ends<br />\nof a double header against<br />\nLoyola the day before, 9-1 and<br />\n5-3.<br />\nOn Tuesday the Blue Jays ran<br />\ninto some tough Loyola pitching.<br />\nIn the first game, Loyola's<br />\nmound star fanned twelve batters<br />\nand allowed only four hits.<br />\nLoyola exploded for eight runs in<br />\nthe first two innings on only<br />\nthree hits. The lone Blue Jay run<br />\nwas scored in the fourth as Jack<br />\nBukowski singled, Mike Bogdan<br />\nwalked and Gary Rostkowski<br />\nfollowed with a single, scoring<br />\nthe lead runner.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins as with one from<br />\nPrinceton or the other Ivy<br />\nLeague schools.\"<br />\nRenowned for his long clearing<br />\npasses, Matthews credits his<br />\nattackmen and the plastic stick<br />\nfor the successful maneuver. \"It's<br />\ndifficult to catch the ball with a<br />\ndefenseman bearing down on<br />\nyou,\" said Les when referring to<br />\nthe ability of the attackmen to<br />\nhandle his bombs. \"But the<br />\nplastic stick makes a longer and<br />\nmore accurate throw possible.\"<br />\nAccording to Matthews, the<br />\ndifference between the 1972 and<br />\n1973 lacrosse teams is that this<br />\nyear the Blue Jays have more<br />\ndepth. \"The defense is also now<br />\nas good as the 1972 version,<br />\n<br />\nalthough it took us a while to get<br />\nour' timing and coordination<br />\ndown,\" sighed Matthews.<br />\nCommenting on his coach, Les<br />\nstated, \"Mr. Scott is the best.<br />\nPeriod. He's not only a great<br />\nstrategist, but the best at mental<br />\npreparation.\" With the likes of<br />\nJoe Cowan, Jerry Schnydman,<br />\nFred Smith, Buzzy Budnitz, and<br />\nWillie Scroggs aiding Scott,<br />\nHopkins has the best coaching<br />\nstaff in the country.<br />\nMatthews stressed the<br />\nimportance of fan support to the<br />\nteam. \"We've had great support<br />\nwherever we've gone.

Love, professor and<br />\nchairman of the Department of<br />\nBiophysics and includes Eato<br />\nLattman, a research associate,<br />\nand graduate students Keith<br />\nWard and Barry Wishner.<br />\nHemoglobin moleules, both<br />\nnormal and sickle cell, exist in<br />\ntwo states in the blood stream:<br />\noxygenated after passing through<br />\nthe lungs, and deoxygenated<br />\nafter they have released the<br />\noxygen at some point in the<br />\nbody.<br />\nThe latter is the important<br />\nstate as far as study of the<br />\ndiseased molecule is concerned.<br />\nIt is in this deoxygenated state<br /><br />\nthat the molecules stick together<br />\nand distort the red blood cell in<br />\nwhich they are contained. This<br />\ncauses the painful \"sickle cell<br />\ncrisis\" in sickle cell anemia. The<br />\nanemia is a hereditary disease<br />\nwhich affects approximately one<br />\nblack person in forty.<br />\nAccording to Love, electron<br />\nmicroscopy does not yield<br />\nsufficient detail to reveal the<br />\natomic structure of the molecules<br />\nand up to now,it has not been<br />\npossible to analyze them by x-ray<br />\ndiffraction because of technical<br />\ndifficulties in crystalizing<br />\ndeoxygenated sickle cell<br />\nhemoglobin. The crystalization<br />\nprocess is a prerequisite for<br />\nemployment of the x-ray<br />\ndiffraction. Love began working<br />\non the sickle cell problem nearly<br />\ntwo years ago. The research<br />\ngroup's initial success came last<br />\nyear in January when Wishner<br />\nsucceeded in growing diffraction<br />\nquality crystals of deoxygenated<br />\nsickle cell hemoglobin.

The problem was<br />\nachieved with the aid of<br />\ncomputer facilities at Hopkins<br />\nApplied Physics Lab.<br />\nLove explained that there was<br />\nan element of risk involved in the<br />\nstudy. \"It is possible<br />\nin the<br />\nprocess of crystalization,\" he<br />\n*said, \"that the hemoglobin<br />\nmolecules may be altered such<br />\nthat they no longer represent<br />\nwhat actually goes on in the<br />\nhuman blood stream.\" But Love<br />\nadded that his group was hopeful<br />\nthat in their study of the<br />\nmolecule's crystalline structure<br />\nthey will in fact come up with a<br />\ntrue picture of what the sickled<br />\nhemoglobin molecule looks like.<br />\nThe end product of the<br />\ndiffraction analysis will be a<br /><br />\npecora's<br />\nresturant<br /><br />\nYA LATER, from page 1<br />\nA meeting was held yesterday<br />\nbetween trustees of the<br />\nUniversity and the Hospital to<br />\noutline a nationwide soliciting<br />\ncampaign.

Each spring<br />\nSaturday for the past two years,<br />\nLes Matthews has performed this<br />\nritual for the Johns Hopkins Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nA graduate of St. Paul's<br />\nSchool, Matthews has been at<br />\nhome in the crease ever since the<br />\nthird grade and has become most<br />\nproficient at that position in the<br />\nfourteen intervening years. His<br />\ntalents have not gone unnoticed,<br />\ns Les was named the<br />\noutstanding collegiate goalkeeper<br />\nin the nation last year, winning<br />\nthe C. Markland Kelly Award.<br />\n\"Goalie is the most challenging<br />\nposition because you are the last<br />\nbarrier between the other team<br />\nand a score,\" stated the first<br />\nteam All-American who is a<br />\nco-captain of the 1973 Blue Jays.<br />\n\"But when you do well, it gives<br />\nyou a lot of personal<br />\nsatisfaction.\"<br />\nAt St. Paul's, Matthews was<br />\nAll-MSA goalie for two years. In<br /><br />\nhis senior year there, he was<br />\ncaptain of his lacrosse team, an<br />\nhonorable mention All-State<br />\nhalfback in football, and was<br />\nnamed the outstanding high<br />\nschool lacrosse player in<br />\nMaryland. In addition to<br />\ncontinuing lacrosse at Hopkins,<br />\nLes has been a housemaster,<br />\nplayed football, and is a member<br />\nof the H Club and the Phi Gam<br />\nFraternity.<br />\nHeavily recruited by several<br />\nschools, Matthews chose Hopkins<br />\nover the Ivy League for two<br />\nreasons. He felt that Hopkins<br />\noffered the best combination of<br />\nacademics and lacrosse.<br />\nMoreover, since he had seen<br />\nevery home Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\ngame while in high school, he felt<br />\nhe belonged here.<br />\nAnd he has not been<br />\ndisappointed. \"The quality of<br />\neducation at Hopkins is as good<br />\nas that of the Ivies, plus there is<br />\nmore personal contact with the<br />\nfaculty and administration,\"<br />\nenthused the natural sciences<br />\narea major.\"In addition, you can<br />\ndo as much with a degree from<br /><br />\nJays find diamond in<br />\nthe rough; win 16-9<br />\nup a run in the last inning, but<br />\nthe rally fell short.<br />\nWednesday afternoon the Blue<br />\nJay bats again broke out. In the<br />\nseven innings played, they rapped<br />\n15 hits for their 16 runs. Greg<br />\nOta relieved Jim Pitts and<br />\nreceived credit for the win,<br />\nthanks to an eight-run seventh<br />\ninning. Entering the fifth, the<br />\nJays were down 8-1, but they<br />\nscored 15 runs in the next three<br />\ninnings to blow the game wide<br />\nopen.<br />\nSenior outfielder Alan<br />\nPeerless, in his last game at<br />\nHomewood, came up with a<br />\nperfect day at the plate. His four<br />\nhits and a walk enabled him to<br />\nscore two runs and drive two<br />\nothers home. Shortstop Tom<br />\nPedroni socked three singles,<br />\nstole two bases and scampered<br />\nhome with three runs.<br />\nDespite Tom's and Alan's<br />\nperformances, the hitting star of<br />\nthe day had to be Mike Bogdan.<br />\nMike hit for the cycle, one of the<br />\ntruly phenomenal feats a batter<br />\ncan accomplish in a single game,<br />\nand knocked in five runs.

The Blue Jays picked. who will not be back next year.<br />\nBy STEVEN BROWN<br />\nWednesday afternoon the Blue<br />\nJay baseball team played their<br />\nwildest game of the season. The<br />\ngame was called a forfeit in the<br />\ntop of the eighth inning with<br />\nHopkins in front, 16-9. The<br />\nDickinson coach, angered by<br />\nsome earlier calls made by the<br />\nplate umpire, protested a low<br />\nstrike a little too loudly. After a<br />\nfew words with the coach, the<br />\numpire stopped the game and<br />\nawarded Hopkins the win. The<br />\nvictory was highly appreciated<br />\nafter the Jays dropped both ends<br />\nof a double header against<br />\nLoyola the day before, 9-1 and<br />\n5-3.<br />\nOn Tuesday the Blue Jays ran<br />\ninto some tough Loyola pitching.<br />\nIn the first game, Loyola's<br />\nmound star fanned twelve batters<br />\nand allowed only four hits.<br />\nLoyola exploded for eight runs in<br />\nthe first two innings on only<br />\nthree hits. The lone Blue Jay run<br />\nwas scored in the fourth as Jack<br />\nBukowski singled, Mike Bogdan<br />\nwalked and Gary Rostkowski<br />\nfollowed with a single, scoring<br />\nthe lead runner.<br /><br />\nHopkins as with one from<br />\nPrinceton or the other Ivy<br />\nLeague schools.\"<br />\nRenowned for his long clearing<br />\npasses, Matthews credits his<br />\nattackmen and the plastic stick<br />\nfor the successful maneuver. \"It's<br />\ndifficult to catch the ball with a<br />\ndefenseman bearing down on<br />\nyou,\" said Les when referring to<br />\nthe ability of the attackmen to<br />\nhandle his bombs. \"But the<br />\nplastic stick makes a longer and<br />\nmore accurate throw possible.\"<br />\nAccording to Matthews, the<br />\ndifference between the 1972 and<br />\n1973 lacrosse teams is that this<br />\nyear the Blue Jays have more<br />\ndepth. \"The defense is also now<br />\nas good as the 1972 version,<br /><br />\nalthough it took us a while to get<br />\nour' timing and coordination<br />\ndown,\" sighed Matthews.<br />\nCommenting on his coach, Les<br />\nstated, \"Mr. Scott is the best.<br />\nPeriod. He's not only a great<br />\nstrategist, but the best at mental<br />\npreparation.\" With the likes of<br />\nJoe Cowan, Jerry Schnydman,<br />\nFred Smith, Buzzy Budnitz, and<br />\nWillie Scroggs aiding Scott,<br />\nHopkins has the best coaching<br />\nstaff in the country.<br />\nMatthews stressed the<br />\nimportance of fan support to the<br />\nteam. \"We've had great support<br />\nwherever we've gone.
