Robert certainly didn't,\"<br />\nhe mused.<br />\nStone hastened to add. \"This<br />\nstory is not in all of its elements<br />\ntrue. but in my head it's certainly true.- He concluded that<br />\none function of turning fact into<br />\nfiction is to learn about oneself.<br />\n\"The truth actually hinders you<br />\nin your writing.- he commented.<br />\nHe agreed with Henry James'<br />\ntheory that it is better not to know<br />\nthe whole story \"because it will<br />\nunhinge one's creativity.

Eisenhower Symposium<br />\ndrew to a close last week with John Cardinal O'Connor presenting the final lecture on the Symposium topic, \"Religion<br />\nand Politics: The Separation of Church<br />\nand State.\" In the wake of that address,<br />\nthoughts are already turning to the<br />\nfuture of the M.S.E. Symposium.<br />\nWe're never ones to pass up an opportunity to get our two cents in, so allow<br />\nus a few reflections.<br />\nBefore this year's lecture series<br />\nbegan, we predicted that it would be a<br />\nsuccess. We argued at the time that the<br />\nwell-balanced line-up of speakers capped with lectures by Pat Robertson and<br />\nCardinal O'Connor, two nationally prominent leaders in American religious<br />\ncircles, would create a Symposium of<br />\nwhich the community could be proud.<br />\nOur prediction, in hind-sight, seems to<br />\nhave been fulfilled. Our compliments to<br />\nM.S.E. Symposium Chairmen Paul<br />\nCarliner and Zeid Radd.<br />\nSoon, the Student Council's Committee on Commmittees(COC), led by Student Council Vice-President Simran<br />\nBrara, will begin the search for next<br />\nyear's co-chairmen and topic. We hope<br />\nthe COC will be as successful in that<br />\nsearch as it was last year. A few suggestions may be helpful.<br />\nA good starting place for improving<br />\nthe Symposium next year would be to<br />\nexpand the scope of the series. In recent<br />\nyears, there has been a trend towards<br />\nchoosing topics of a highly political<br />\nnature. Arms control, terrorism, and the<br />\ndynamics of foreign policy have all been<br />\naddressed consecutively. This year's<br />\ntopic of \"Religion and Politics\" was<br />\nsomething of a diversion, but remained<br />\nnevertheless highly political.<br />\nNext year, a completely different kind<br />\nof symposium topic\u2014something that<br />\ndoesn't sound like it was lifted directly<br />\nfrom the list of Poli Sci course offerings in the Circular\u2014would be a<br />\nwelcome relief.<br />\nSome appealing examples include:<br />\n(The Pen as a Sword: The Power of<br />\nthe Press in a Free Society (a particularly appealing topic for us in the<br />\nbusiness). Speakers could address the<br />\nrole of the press in shaping the news,<br />\nthe shortcomings and advantages of the<br />\nelectronic media, the state of First Ammendment rights in the twentieth century, the psychological power of the<br />\nprinted word in affecting attitudes,<br />\netc. . . .<br />\ncThe Future of Medicine. With so<br />\nmany pre-meds out and about, it's surprising this topic hasn't received more<br />\nattention in recent Symposiums.<br />\nSpeakers could examine the implications of medical advances for society,<br />\nmedical ethics, world health management, and national issues like health insurance, HMO's, socialized medicine,<br />\nand Medicare. With the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Institutions only minutes away,<br />\none of the world's foremost medical<br />\n<br />\nresources is available (cheaply) for the<br />\nasking.<br />\ncAmerican Culture: Does It Exist?<br />\nWe proposed this topic last year but remain intrigued by it. Is there a uniquely American culture? If so, how is it<br />\ntransmitted. Does it possess its own<br />\nbody of music literature, or film? What<br />\nis its relation to other cultures? The most<br />\ninteresting aspect of this topic is the<br />\nfascinating array of speakers it could<br />\ndraw. Leaders in fields from the arts to<br />\nthe sciences and everything in between<br />\ncould be represented.<br />\nIn addition to expanding the scope of<br />\nthe Symposium topic, there are some<br />\ntactical improvements that could be<br />\nmade. Spreading the Symposium out<br />\nover a longer period, perhaps months,<br />\nwould probably be a wise move for next<br />\nyear's Symposium chairmen. Traditionally, the Symposium lectures have<br />\nbeen lumped together, usually within<br />\nthe space of two or three weeks. The<br />\nidea has been that a concentrated Symposium is a unified Symposium.<br />\nPracticality, however, suggests that<br />\nthis tradition should be abandonned.<br />\nScheduling for most major speakers is<br />\ndone months in advance. Frequently,<br />\ndesirable lecturers are eliminated from<br />\nconsideration simply because they are<br />\nnot able to make the three or four dates<br />\noffered. Expanding the length of the<br />\nSymposium would give heavily booked potential speakers more flexibility in<br />\narranging to attend the series. Consequently, \"quality\" speakers would be<br />\nmore likely to attend.<br />\nA final improvement that next year's<br />\nchairmen would do well to make is to<br />\ncontinue the \"Garrett Room Discussions\"\u2014an innovation created this year<br />\nby Carliner and Raad.<br />\nThe Garrett Room Discussions, as<br />\nconceived by Carliner and Raad this<br />\nyear, seem to be an answer to one of<br />\nthe most challenging perennial problems<br />\nposed by the Symposium\u2014how can one<br />\nattract spectators to lectures by little<br />\nknown speakers? Since the Symposium<br />\nhas only limited financial resources, it<br />\nfrequently has relied upon little-known<br />\nlecturers to fill the void between one or<br />\ntwo principal speakers. Such lecturers<br />\noften attract miserably small audiences.<br />\nThis year, however, the idea of teaming up speakers on the same evening in<br />\na less formal environment seems to have<br />\npaid off. Not only was the idea greeted<br />\nreceptively, judging from attendance,<br />\nbut the dual lecture added considerable<br />\ndepth to the analysis of the Symposium<br />\ntopic.<br />\nWhen Brara and members of the<br />\nCOC meet in upcoming weeks to begin<br />\nthe selection process for next year's<br />\nSymposium Chairmen, they will be<br />\nmaking difficult decisions. We hope that<br />\nthe COC will nevertheless have the<br />\nwherewithall and the good luck to select<br />\na topic and chairmen at least as intriguing as this year's.<br />\n<br />\nfrankly<br />\nhoward<br />\nIn the interests of sanity, the<br />\nauthor has taken a vacation this<br />\nvveek.

He is, in fact, so<br />\nselfless and trusting that he let me<br />\nwrite his column this week. One<br />\nthing I don't touch, however, is<br />\nFrank's wallet. A searing letter to<br />\nthe editor last week called Frank<br />\n'brutally amok'', and yet the<br />\nregular author of this column was<br />\nnot so deranged as to lose track<br />\nof his money. No sir, trusting and<br />\ngenerous as he may he, Mr. Wu,<br />\nlike any other rational human being, is possessive of his material<br />\nwealth.

Whatever its intent, it<br />\ncame across only as a selfcentered and petty attempt at<br />\nhumor through simple degradation. There was no parody. no<br />\ntrue absurdity, nothing that was<br />\nreally comic. There was only the<br />\nauthor's obnoxious and constricted distortion of what might<br />\nhave been some merely banal incident. That not being allowed to<br />\ndrink a Diet Coke in the HUT<br />\nwould result in such a harsh<br />\n(though inane) attack on one of<br />\nthe workers there is incomprehensible. To degrade that<br />\nworker for the point of humor is<br />\nat best immature and at worst<br />\nmalicious.<br />\nPerhaps even more unfortunate<br />\nwas the method of degradation.<br />\nChildish stereotypes about sexuality are just that\u2014they stopped<br />\nbeing humorous sometime during<br />\nelementary school. In a college<br />\nnewspaper they can only offend.<br />\nGranted, humor should be provacative and at times offensive\u2014<br />\nbut only in questioning conventions or norms. In resorting to so<br />\n'tired and prejudiced cliches,<br />\nMs.Holsinger has succeeded only in portraying some primitive<br />\nform of homophobia. That this<br />\nwas put forward in a column<br />\ndesigned to amuse, or in the<br />\nNews-Letter at all, is, I must<br />\nrepeat, inexcusable.<br />\nTimothy Randolph<br />\n<br />\ninger and the News-Letter believe<br />\nthat Gay people are fair game for<br />\nsuch attacks. It never ceases to<br />\namaze me that literate, suppposedly well-educated people can<br />\ncontinue to demonstrate such profound insensitivity, prejudice,<br />\nand stupidity. Most respectable<br />\njournals in this country have added a section to their hanbdbooks<br />\nof style banishing sexist, racist.<br />\nand homophobic language. You<br />\nare urged to do the same. The<br />\nGay community has no intention<br />\nof tolerating such offensive, unprofessional journalism.<br />\nJoshua L.

Sexist slurs, even<br />\nfrom a woman, are nevertheless<br />\nsexist slurs, and deserve no place<br />\nin responsible journalism on this<br />\ncampus. I suggest that Ms.Holsinger resign or find a different<br />\noutlet than the News-Letter to express her homophobic and<br />\nmisogynous views.<br />\nFurthermore, the editors<br />\nshould be more careful in selecting articles such as this and the<br />\narticle relating race and IQ, to<br />\nshow that the News-Letter is not<br />\nbecoming a forum for dangerous<br />\nracist and sexist stereotypes.<br />\n<br />\nPrimitive Homophobia<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nJessica Reed<br />\n<br />\nDisplaced Credit<br />\n<br />\nThere is only one thing more<br />\npathetic than an unamusing attempt at comic writing: an<br />\nunamusing attempt at comic<br />\nwriting that turns, in desperation,<br />\nto racism, sexism, and<br />\nhomophobia. Londa Holsinger's<br />\n\"Spam on Wry\" was only the<br />\nmost recent in a long line of such<br />\nunacceptable tripe. It is most<br />\nunlikely that Ms. Holsinger<br />\nwould have written such an offensive piece portraying .a member<br />\nof the black community in the<br />\nsame vile, hatred-infused manner.

Certainly the<br />\nCoalition may consider constructive engagement to be a misguided policy, but obviously their opinion hardly constitutes grounds<br />\nfor impeaching the President, and<br />\ncertainly has nothing to do with<br />\nthe Hopkins investment portfolio. Finally, graffitti depicting<br />\nlinked symbols(male-male, malefemale, and female-female) has<br />\nabsolutely nothing to do with<br />\ndivestment in South Africa,<br />\nunless there is a connection between gay rights and South<br />\nAfrica.

This patch<br />\ncovers the painting of the Northern Lights. Erdrich explains<br />\nthat some people have never seen<br />\nthe Northern Lights and think the<br />\npainting is of car headlights.<br />\nThe novel chronicles relationships of love and hate, relationships which are complex and can<br />\nonly be reduced to soap opera in<br />\na summary. In chapters narrated<br />\nby different characters in different periods, a story unfolds, of<br />\nNector and Marie Kashpaw. Nector has been in love with Lulu<br />\nNanapush (who becomes Lulu<br />\nLamartine). He is snagged by<br />\nMarie and they have children who<br />\nin turn have children. The events<br />\nwhich occur in the course of the<br />\nbook span far too much time and<br />\ninclude far too many people to<br />\ndetail here; suffice it to say that<br />\npeople live out stories. Even with<br />\na broad comtemporary introduction to the cast, the novel is unwieldy. This is not even a<br />\nnuisance though, only part of the<br />\nattraction of the discovery of<br />\nreading because it is all so<br />\nconvincing.<br />\nAs \"minority\" writing goes,<br />\nErdrich's work sets an example.<br />\nThe fact that the characters are<br />\nAmerican Indians is not made a<br />\nnovelty. Nector Kashpaw may<br />\ncome from a long line of tribal<br />\nleaders and he does visit Congress and hold an official position<br />\nof more work than reward, but no<br />\n<br />\npeeled an egg for her, a pink<br />\nspecial effort is made to give a<br />\none, saying it matched her<br />\npolemical message. Nector's<br />\nturtleneck. She told him it was<br />\nbrother Eli, who was raised in the<br />\nno turtleneck. You called these<br />\n\"wild,\" does not become senile,<br />\nthings shells. He said he would<br />\nwhile he slowly digenerates.<br />\nEven then, the stories do not depeel that for her too, if she<br />\nwanted. Then, he grinned at the<br />\npend on a gimmick; instead, the<br />\nbackground is accepted and there<br />\nbartender and handed her the<br />\nnaked egg.<br />\nis far more to the novel than just<br />\nAmerican Indian characters.<br />\nIf there is any leaning toward<br />\na \"message,\" the same voice is<br />\nshared by all characters\u2014this is<br />\nno more an Indian feature than a<br />\nuniversal, better attributed to the<br />\ntheme of love and lending to the<br />\nintricate links between the individuals. (Lipsha Morrissey of<br />\nthe title piece is distinctive. He is<br />\nalso an outsider of sorts.) The<br />\nperiod details are subtle, almost<br />\ntaken for granted, giving a<br />\ntimeless feel to the relationships.<br />\nNector Kashpaw says of Lulu<br />\nNanapush (Lamartine): \"For the<br />\nfirst time, on seeing her, I knew<br />\nexactly what I wanted. We sparked each other. We met behind the<br />\ndance house and kissed. I knew<br />\n1 wanted more of that sweet taste<br />\non her mouth . . .\" As a grown<br />\nman, he writes to her, \"You<br />\nwanted me so long. Well, you've<br />\ngot me now!

The standard biographical<br />\nsquib: she is of American Indian<br />\nand German ancestry (her name<br />\nmeans \"rich earth\" in German,<br />\nshe says), she studies in the<br />\nHopkins Writing Seminars, her<br />\nfirst novel, Love Medicine, won<br />\nthe National Book Critics Award<br />\nfor Fiction and her second novel,<br />\n<br />\n1,0vE<br />\nDKINE<br />\n4LCKi NI LIADI'd(11<br />\n<br />\nIL<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nA fifteen year-old Albertine,<br />\ngranddaughter, runs away from<br />\nhome. In a bus station, \"she<br />\nwasn't sure what to do next. A<br />\nchair was open. Beside it a standing ashtray bristled with butts,<br />\ncrushed soft-drink cups, flattened straws.\" She too picks up or<br />\nis picked up and her actions begin<br />\nto parallel those of her aunt.<br />\nThese similarities, carried between character and character and<br />\nover the course of time, show the<br />\nskill of Erdrich's writing. She<br />\ndemonstrates that cliche of<br />\nwriting workshops everywhere,<br />\n\"Don't tell. Show.\" The catch is,<br />\na story should be told and the<br />\nmeaning should be shown.

Chamberlain Leads Men<br />\nt) *Jeffrey A. Lee<br />\nThis past weekend the Lady<br />\nHarriers traveled to Gettysburg,<br />\nPennsylvania for the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Coast Conference Championships. All the Jays ran competitively as the team was able to<br />\ncapture a respectable sixth place<br />\novei-all. Leading the Jays in this<br />\nrace was the season-hardened<br />\nveteran Molly Bardsley who<br />\nFinished 14th overall in 19:59.<br />\nBardsley's high finish was<br />\nnoteworthy considering her<br />\nphysical state of being just a few<br />\nmonths previous. In late August.<br />\nBardsley lay in a hospital bed<br />\nwith a severe concussion after<br />\nriding her bicycle into a speeding<br />\ncar. If not for her safety helmet<br />\nand the unusual thickness of her<br />\nskull, Bardsley would have sustained more serious injuries. As<br />\nit was, the injury wreaked havoc<br />\nwith her training schedule. In the<br />\nface of all these odds. Bardsley<br />\n<br />\nFootball<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\neligibilities, etc., this year's<br />\nsenior class on the team has<br />\nbecome almost non-existent. Last<br />\nyear's graduation took away most<br />\nof the starting defense, and the<br />\nbest runner and second best<br />\nquarterback in school history, and<br />\nthis year's class hasn't stepped in<br />\nand taken over. All told, a very<br />\nhigh percentage of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores dot the roster. which<br />\nbodes well for the future hut not<br />\nfor the present.<br />\nInterceptions: Combined. Blue<br />\nJays QB's have thrown 19 of<br />\nthem, as opposed to a total of only<br />\nA touchdown passes. That's a<br />\npretty bad ratio. Due to injuries<br />\nand ineffectiveness. Pfeifer has<br />\nhad to rotate Rupert. Malas, and<br />\nGoudy without much success. All<br />\nhave completed less than hal;<br />\ntheir passes.<br />\n\"We've used three quarterbacks this year after graduating a<br />\nfour year starter,\" says Pfeifer.<br />\n'It's been a very unsettling position. That's part of our problem.<br />\nbut certainly not all of it.''<br />\nInconsistency: The Blue Jays<br />\noffense has scored 81 points in<br />\neight games, which isn't awful in<br />\nitself. The problem is that they<br />\nhave scored 7 points or less five<br />\ntimes. On defense. Hopkins has<br />\nbeen either very good or very<br />\nhad. Early in the season. the Jays<br />\nwent from a shutout one week to<br />\nyielding 34 points the next.<br />\nAs had as this year has been<br />\nthough. there's always optimism.<br />\nFor one thing. Western Maryland<br />\nis winless going into tomorrow's<br />\ngame, which means the Jays will<br />\nlikely triumph. Looking ahead to<br />\nnext year, Hopkins should be<br />\nback as a contender.<br />\nAccording to Pfeifer, \"We<br />\nhave spine real fine young<br />\nplayers. I'm happy with their<br />\nabilities, their character, and their<br />\nnumbers.- Indeed. Pfeifer has an<br />\nexcellent foundation on which to<br />\nthe<br />\nrebuild, particularly<br />\nsophomore running back tandem<br />\nof Chris Chirieleison and Brian<br />\nDulin.

Kim gained precious points for the team<br />\nwith a devastating finishing kick<br />\nbegun from a dangerous 300<br />\nmeters out. This potentially<br />\ndisastrous gambit was the result<br />\nof the placement of the flags<br />\nmarking the finish of the course<br />\nhundreds of meters away from<br />\nthe finishing chute. Realizing her<br />\nmistake. Kim relaxed her pace<br />\nbefore hitting her 'turbos' for the<br />\nreal finish.<br />\nFollowing the streaking Kim<br />\nwas Michelle Silverman, the first<br />\nof four frosh running for the Harriers. Silverman finished in the<br />\ntop forty with a time of 21:05.<br />\nClose behind Silverman in 21:21<br />\nwas frosh Audra Mai. Audra is<br />\none of the two frosh recruits from<br />\nthe previously untapped running<br />\nsource of Alaska. Coach Eleanor<br />\nSimonsick-Green describes these<br />\nAlaskan runners as a \"tough<br />\nbreed of athlete who run along the<br />\npipeline through frozen tundras in<br />\nbelow freezing weather.- Audra<br />\nis joined by fellow Alaskan Kelly Keiffer who finished sixth for<br />\nthe Jays.

He said that most<br />\nof his literary education was<br />\n\"self-administered.- He said his<br />\nwriting technique \"begins usually<br />\nwith the 3x5 cards- that he carries in his pocket. On these cards<br />\nhe notes various comments,<br />\nbooks he wants to read and things<br />\nthat he needs to do. When the<br />\ncards accumulate, he sits down<br />\n4nd looks through them to find<br />\nthat \"they've coalesced like iron<br />\nfilings to a magnet.\"<br />\nChance comments by patients<br />\nand coworkers led him into a new<br />\nliterary genre\u2014the short story.<br />\nStone read from his works to<br />\nshow the \"commonalities of<br />\nliterature and medicine.\" His<br />\nfirst selection was a short story<br />\nabout a doctor's experience with<br />\na burn victim. The patient was<br />\nseverly burned and told the doctors that he had suffered his<br />\nwounds while rescuing a young<br />\nboy from a late-night fire in the<br />\nboy's home.<br />\nThe patient's name was Robert.<br />\nThe doctor in Stone's story<br />\ndescribes Robert's ravaged facial<br />\nskin as \"a variably cooling recent<br />\nlava flow,'' To the doctor,<br />\nRobert's eyelids were his most<br />\nstriking aspect: \"They had the<br />\nlook of complete terror. .. They<br />\nlent to his face the unmistakable<br />\nappearance of one who has seen<br />\ndeath and been changed by it.\"<br />\nRobert's condition worsened in<br />\nspite of all the doctor's efforts.<br />\n\"We were trapped, and so was<br />\nRobert.- The doctors tried more<br />\ntoxic- antibiotics and additional<br /><br />\nskin grafts but Robert's kidneys<br />\nbegan to fail. \"The raging fever<br />\nreturned, he was going out in a<br />\nblaze, an inferno of infection.\"<br />\nOn the day that Robert died,<br />\n\"his heart had skipped, shuddered and stopped.- Afterwards<br />\nthe doctors learned that Robert<br />\nwas not a hero but an arsonist<br />\nwho had set two fires and was<br />\ntrapped between them. \"His tale<br />\nabout his heroism and saving the<br />\nboy was a lie,- said Stone.<br />\nThis story reminded Stone of<br />\nhis days in medical ethics class.<br />\n-I like to think knowing the truth<br />\nwould not have changed our efforts to save him, but who<br />\nknows? Robert certainly didn't,\"<br />\nhe mused.<br />\nStone hastened to add. \"This<br />\nstory is not in all of its elements<br />\ntrue. but in my head it's certainly true.- He concluded that<br />\none function of turning fact into<br />\nfiction is to learn about oneself.<br />\n\"The truth actually hinders you<br />\nin your writing.- he commented.<br />\nHe agreed with Henry James'<br />\ntheory that it is better not to know<br />\nthe whole story \"because it will<br />\nunhinge one's creativity. What<br />\nhappens in the domain of the<br />\nmind is a wondrous kind of<br />\nthing,\" he continued.<br />\nStone does not restrict his<br />\nwriting to medical topics.<br />\nhowever.

Eisenhower Symposium<br />\ndrew to a close last week with John Cardinal O'Connor presenting the final lecture on the Symposium topic, \"Religion<br />\nand Politics: The Separation of Church<br />\nand State.\" In the wake of that address,<br />\nthoughts are already turning to the<br />\nfuture of the M.S.E. Symposium.<br />\nWe're never ones to pass up an opportunity to get our two cents in, so allow<br />\nus a few reflections.<br />\nBefore this year's lecture series<br />\nbegan, we predicted that it would be a<br />\nsuccess. We argued at the time that the<br />\nwell-balanced line-up of speakers capped with lectures by Pat Robertson and<br />\nCardinal O'Connor, two nationally prominent leaders in American religious<br />\ncircles, would create a Symposium of<br />\nwhich the community could be proud.<br />\nOur prediction, in hind-sight, seems to<br />\nhave been fulfilled. Our compliments to<br />\nM.S.E. Symposium Chairmen Paul<br />\nCarliner and Zeid Radd.<br />\nSoon, the Student Council's Committee on Commmittees(COC), led by Student Council Vice-President Simran<br />\nBrara, will begin the search for next<br />\nyear's co-chairmen and topic. We hope<br />\nthe COC will be as successful in that<br />\nsearch as it was last year. A few suggestions may be helpful.<br />\nA good starting place for improving<br />\nthe Symposium next year would be to<br />\nexpand the scope of the series. In recent<br />\nyears, there has been a trend towards<br />\nchoosing topics of a highly political<br />\nnature. Arms control, terrorism, and the<br />\ndynamics of foreign policy have all been<br />\naddressed consecutively. This year's<br />\ntopic of \"Religion and Politics\" was<br />\nsomething of a diversion, but remained<br />\nnevertheless highly political.<br />\nNext year, a completely different kind<br />\nof symposium topic\u2014something that<br />\ndoesn't sound like it was lifted directly<br />\nfrom the list of Poli Sci course offerings in the Circular\u2014would be a<br />\nwelcome relief.<br />\nSome appealing examples include:<br />\n(The Pen as a Sword: The Power of<br />\nthe Press in a Free Society (a particularly appealing topic for us in the<br />\nbusiness). Speakers could address the<br />\nrole of the press in shaping the news,<br />\nthe shortcomings and advantages of the<br />\nelectronic media, the state of First Ammendment rights in the twentieth century, the psychological power of the<br />\nprinted word in affecting attitudes,<br />\netc. . . .<br />\ncThe Future of Medicine. With so<br />\nmany pre-meds out and about, it's surprising this topic hasn't received more<br />\nattention in recent Symposiums.<br />\nSpeakers could examine the implications of medical advances for society,<br />\nmedical ethics, world health management, and national issues like health insurance, HMO's, socialized medicine,<br />\nand Medicare. With the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Institutions only minutes away,<br />\none of the world's foremost medical<br /><br />\nresources is available (cheaply) for the<br />\nasking.<br />\ncAmerican Culture: Does It Exist?<br />\nWe proposed this topic last year but remain intrigued by it. Is there a uniquely American culture? If so, how is it<br />\ntransmitted. Does it possess its own<br />\nbody of music literature, or film? What<br />\nis its relation to other cultures? The most<br />\ninteresting aspect of this topic is the<br />\nfascinating array of speakers it could<br />\ndraw. Leaders in fields from the arts to<br />\nthe sciences and everything in between<br />\ncould be represented.<br />\nIn addition to expanding the scope of<br />\nthe Symposium topic, there are some<br />\ntactical improvements that could be<br />\nmade. Spreading the Symposium out<br />\nover a longer period, perhaps months,<br />\nwould probably be a wise move for next<br />\nyear's Symposium chairmen. Traditionally, the Symposium lectures have<br />\nbeen lumped together, usually within<br />\nthe space of two or three weeks. The<br />\nidea has been that a concentrated Symposium is a unified Symposium.<br />\nPracticality, however, suggests that<br />\nthis tradition should be abandonned.<br />\nScheduling for most major speakers is<br />\ndone months in advance. Frequently,<br />\ndesirable lecturers are eliminated from<br />\nconsideration simply because they are<br />\nnot able to make the three or four dates<br />\noffered. Expanding the length of the<br />\nSymposium would give heavily booked potential speakers more flexibility in<br />\narranging to attend the series. Consequently, \"quality\" speakers would be<br />\nmore likely to attend.<br />\nA final improvement that next year's<br />\nchairmen would do well to make is to<br />\ncontinue the \"Garrett Room Discussions\"\u2014an innovation created this year<br />\nby Carliner and Raad.<br />\nThe Garrett Room Discussions, as<br />\nconceived by Carliner and Raad this<br />\nyear, seem to be an answer to one of<br />\nthe most challenging perennial problems<br />\nposed by the Symposium\u2014how can one<br />\nattract spectators to lectures by little<br />\nknown speakers? Since the Symposium<br />\nhas only limited financial resources, it<br />\nfrequently has relied upon little-known<br />\nlecturers to fill the void between one or<br />\ntwo principal speakers. Such lecturers<br />\noften attract miserably small audiences.<br />\nThis year, however, the idea of teaming up speakers on the same evening in<br />\na less formal environment seems to have<br />\npaid off. Not only was the idea greeted<br />\nreceptively, judging from attendance,<br />\nbut the dual lecture added considerable<br />\ndepth to the analysis of the Symposium<br />\ntopic.<br />\nWhen Brara and members of the<br />\nCOC meet in upcoming weeks to begin<br />\nthe selection process for next year's<br />\nSymposium Chairmen, they will be<br />\nmaking difficult decisions. We hope that<br />\nthe COC will nevertheless have the<br />\nwherewithall and the good luck to select<br />\na topic and chairmen at least as intriguing as this year's.<br /><br />\nfrankly<br />\nhoward<br />\nIn the interests of sanity, the<br />\nauthor has taken a vacation this<br />\nvveek.

He is, in fact, so<br />\nselfless and trusting that he let me<br />\nwrite his column this week. One<br />\nthing I don't touch, however, is<br />\nFrank's wallet. A searing letter to<br />\nthe editor last week called Frank<br />\n'brutally amok'', and yet the<br />\nregular author of this column was<br />\nnot so deranged as to lose track<br />\nof his money. No sir, trusting and<br />\ngenerous as he may he, Mr. Wu,<br />\nlike any other rational human being, is possessive of his material<br />\nwealth. I, too, share Frank's sentiments, enough so to demand that<br />\nhe. return the ten dollars he owes<br />\nme before I relinquish this article to the desperate hands of the<br />\nNews-Letter.

Whatever its intent, it<br />\ncame across only as a selfcentered and petty attempt at<br />\nhumor through simple degradation. There was no parody. no<br />\ntrue absurdity, nothing that was<br />\nreally comic. There was only the<br />\nauthor's obnoxious and constricted distortion of what might<br />\nhave been some merely banal incident. That not being allowed to<br />\ndrink a Diet Coke in the HUT<br />\nwould result in such a harsh<br />\n(though inane) attack on one of<br />\nthe workers there is incomprehensible. To degrade that<br />\nworker for the point of humor is<br />\nat best immature and at worst<br />\nmalicious.<br />\nPerhaps even more unfortunate<br />\nwas the method of degradation.<br />\nChildish stereotypes about sexuality are just that\u2014they stopped<br />\nbeing humorous sometime during<br />\nelementary school. In a college<br />\nnewspaper they can only offend.<br />\nGranted, humor should be provacative and at times offensive\u2014<br />\nbut only in questioning conventions or norms. In resorting to so<br />\n'tired and prejudiced cliches,<br />\nMs.Holsinger has succeeded only in portraying some primitive<br />\nform of homophobia. That this<br />\nwas put forward in a column<br />\ndesigned to amuse, or in the<br />\nNews-Letter at all, is, I must<br />\nrepeat, inexcusable.<br />\nTimothy Randolph<br /><br />\ninger and the News-Letter believe<br />\nthat Gay people are fair game for<br />\nsuch attacks. It never ceases to<br />\namaze me that literate, suppposedly well-educated people can<br />\ncontinue to demonstrate such profound insensitivity, prejudice,<br />\nand stupidity. Most respectable<br />\njournals in this country have added a section to their hanbdbooks<br />\nof style banishing sexist, racist.<br />\nand homophobic language. You<br />\nare urged to do the same. The<br />\nGay community has no intention<br />\nof tolerating such offensive, unprofessional journalism.<br />\nJoshua L.

Sexist slurs, even<br />\nfrom a woman, are nevertheless<br />\nsexist slurs, and deserve no place<br />\nin responsible journalism on this<br />\ncampus. I suggest that Ms.Holsinger resign or find a different<br />\noutlet than the News-Letter to express her homophobic and<br />\nmisogynous views.<br />\nFurthermore, the editors<br />\nshould be more careful in selecting articles such as this and the<br />\narticle relating race and IQ, to<br />\nshow that the News-Letter is not<br />\nbecoming a forum for dangerous<br />\nracist and sexist stereotypes.<br /><br />\nPrimitive Homophobia<br />\nTo the Editor:<br /><br />\nJessica Reed<br /><br />\nDisplaced Credit<br /><br />\nThere is only one thing more<br />\npathetic than an unamusing attempt at comic writing: an<br />\nunamusing attempt at comic<br />\nwriting that turns, in desperation,<br />\nto racism, sexism, and<br />\nhomophobia. Londa Holsinger's<br />\n\"Spam on Wry\" was only the<br />\nmost recent in a long line of such<br />\nunacceptable tripe. It is most<br />\nunlikely that Ms. Holsinger<br />\nwould have written such an offensive piece portraying .a member<br />\nof the black community in the<br />\nsame vile, hatred-infused manner.

That year's<br />\nhousemasters create situations,<br />\nand one must act out responses.<br />\nThe housemasters for the follow-<br /><br />\nig year are then chosen on the<br />\nbasis of these sessions.<br />\nDespite different backgrounds<br />\nand personalities, many of this<br />\nyear's<br />\nhousemasters<br />\ndemonstrated<br />\na common<br />\ndenominator of wanting to \"give<br />\nback\" something to Johns<br />\nHopkins. it was the best way,\"<br />\nsaid Srikar Reddy of Wilson<br />\nHouse. \"I could give back to the<br />\nUniversity that would positively<br />\naffect a lot of people.

This patch<br />\ncovers the painting of the Northern Lights. Erdrich explains<br />\nthat some people have never seen<br />\nthe Northern Lights and think the<br />\npainting is of car headlights.<br />\nThe novel chronicles relationships of love and hate, relationships which are complex and can<br />\nonly be reduced to soap opera in<br />\na summary. In chapters narrated<br />\nby different characters in different periods, a story unfolds, of<br />\nNector and Marie Kashpaw. Nector has been in love with Lulu<br />\nNanapush (who becomes Lulu<br />\nLamartine). He is snagged by<br />\nMarie and they have children who<br />\nin turn have children. The events<br />\nwhich occur in the course of the<br />\nbook span far too much time and<br />\ninclude far too many people to<br />\ndetail here; suffice it to say that<br />\npeople live out stories. Even with<br />\na broad comtemporary introduction to the cast, the novel is unwieldy. This is not even a<br />\nnuisance though, only part of the<br />\nattraction of the discovery of<br />\nreading because it is all so<br />\nconvincing.<br />\nAs \"minority\" writing goes,<br />\nErdrich's work sets an example.<br />\nThe fact that the characters are<br />\nAmerican Indians is not made a<br />\nnovelty.

(Lipsha Morrissey of<br />\nthe title piece is distinctive. He is<br />\nalso an outsider of sorts.) The<br />\nperiod details are subtle, almost<br />\ntaken for granted, giving a<br />\ntimeless feel to the relationships.<br />\nNector Kashpaw says of Lulu<br />\nNanapush (Lamartine): \"For the<br />\nfirst time, on seeing her, I knew<br />\nexactly what I wanted.

In a bus station, \"she<br />\nwasn't sure what to do next. A<br />\nchair was open. Beside it a standing ashtray bristled with butts,<br />\ncrushed soft-drink cups, flattened straws.\" She too picks up or<br />\nis picked up and her actions begin<br />\nto parallel those of her aunt.<br />\nThese similarities, carried between character and character and<br />\nover the course of time, show the<br />\nskill of Erdrich's writing. She<br />\ndemonstrates that cliche of<br />\nwriting workshops everywhere,<br />\n\"Don't tell. Show.\" The catch is,<br />\na story should be told and the<br />\nmeaning should be shown. True<br />\nto this maxim, Erdrich tells<br />\nstories within stories and carefully layers the whole thing. The<br />\nmeaning is sometimes simple,<br /><br />\noften hidden between stories and<br />\nalways given a twist by the<br />\nnarrators.<br />\nAs for the writing itself, line by<br />\nline, it is not glossy smooth, nor<br />\nis it wordy and obtuse.

Chamberlain Leads Men<br />\nt) *Jeffrey A. Lee<br />\nThis past weekend the Lady<br />\nHarriers traveled to Gettysburg,<br />\nPennsylvania for the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Coast Conference Championships. All the Jays ran competitively as the team was able to<br />\ncapture a respectable sixth place<br />\novei-all. Leading the Jays in this<br />\nrace was the season-hardened<br />\nveteran Molly Bardsley who<br />\nFinished 14th overall in 19:59.<br />\nBardsley's high finish was<br />\nnoteworthy considering her<br />\nphysical state of being just a few<br />\nmonths previous. In late August.<br />\nBardsley lay in a hospital bed<br />\nwith a severe concussion after<br />\nriding her bicycle into a speeding<br />\ncar. If not for her safety helmet<br />\nand the unusual thickness of her<br />\nskull, Bardsley would have sustained more serious injuries. As<br />\nit was, the injury wreaked havoc<br />\nwith her training schedule. In the<br />\nface of all these odds. Bardsley<br /><br />\nFootball<br />\nContinued from Page 16<br />\neligibilities, etc., this year's<br />\nsenior class on the team has<br />\nbecome almost non-existent. Last<br />\nyear's graduation took away most<br />\nof the starting defense, and the<br />\nbest runner and second best<br />\nquarterback in school history, and<br />\nthis year's class hasn't stepped in<br />\nand taken over. All told, a very<br />\nhigh percentage of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores dot the roster. which<br />\nbodes well for the future hut not<br />\nfor the present.<br />\nInterceptions: Combined. Blue<br />\nJays QB's have thrown 19 of<br />\nthem, as opposed to a total of only<br />\nA touchdown passes. That's a<br />\npretty bad ratio. Due to injuries<br />\nand ineffectiveness. Pfeifer has<br />\nhad to rotate Rupert. Malas, and<br />\nGoudy without much success. All<br />\nhave completed less than hal;<br />\ntheir passes.<br />\n\"We've used three quarterbacks this year after graduating a<br />\nfour year starter,\" says Pfeifer.<br />\n'It's been a very unsettling position. That's part of our problem.<br />\nbut certainly not all of it.''<br />\nInconsistency: The Blue Jays<br />\noffense has scored 81 points in<br />\neight games, which isn't awful in<br />\nitself. The problem is that they<br />\nhave scored 7 points or less five<br />\ntimes. On defense. Hopkins has<br />\nbeen either very good or very<br />\nhad. Early in the season. the Jays<br />\nwent from a shutout one week to<br />\nyielding 34 points the next.<br />\nAs had as this year has been<br />\nthough. there's always optimism.<br />\nFor one thing. Western Maryland<br />\nis winless going into tomorrow's<br />\ngame, which means the Jays will<br />\nlikely triumph. Looking ahead to<br />\nnext year, Hopkins should be<br />\nback as a contender.<br />\nAccording to Pfeifer, \"We<br />\nhave spine real fine young<br />\nplayers. I'm happy with their<br />\nabilities, their character, and their<br />\nnumbers.- Indeed. Pfeifer has an<br />\nexcellent foundation on which to<br />\nthe<br />\nrebuild, particularly<br />\nsophomore running back tandem<br />\nof Chris Chirieleison and Brian<br />\nDulin.

Kim gained precious points for the team<br />\nwith a devastating finishing kick<br />\nbegun from a dangerous 300<br />\nmeters out. This potentially<br />\ndisastrous gambit was the result<br />\nof the placement of the flags<br />\nmarking the finish of the course<br />\nhundreds of meters away from<br />\nthe finishing chute. Realizing her<br />\nmistake. Kim relaxed her pace<br />\nbefore hitting her 'turbos' for the<br />\nreal finish.<br />\nFollowing the streaking Kim<br />\nwas Michelle Silverman, the first<br />\nof four frosh running for the Harriers. Silverman finished in the<br />\ntop forty with a time of 21:05.<br />\nClose behind Silverman in 21:21<br />\nwas frosh Audra Mai. Audra is<br />\none of the two frosh recruits from<br />\nthe previously untapped running<br />\nsource of Alaska. Coach Eleanor<br />\nSimonsick-Green describes these<br />\nAlaskan runners as a \"tough<br />\nbreed of athlete who run along the<br />\npipeline through frozen tundras in<br />\nbelow freezing weather.- Audra<br />\nis joined by fellow Alaskan Kelly Keiffer who finished sixth for<br />\nthe Jays.
