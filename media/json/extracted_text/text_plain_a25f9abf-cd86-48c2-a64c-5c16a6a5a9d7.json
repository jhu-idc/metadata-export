The males in these<br />\nspecies merely have to choose<br />\namong all the females clamoring<br />\nfor service, and according to<br />\ntheir rank in the pecking order,<br />\nthese males get the best of the<br />\nwhole lot of sexually aggressive<br />\nfemales. All the males have to do<br />\nIs sit back and enjoy it. (Or however those lower animals do it.)<br />\nBut these are lower animals,<br />\nand even so, the sexual aggressiveness of the females is not<br />\nan attempt to maintain any sort<br />\nof social equilibrium with the<br />\n<br />\nmales, rather, it is the socially<br />\naccepted way that lower animals<br />\ndistribute<br />\nthe<br />\nbest females<br />\namong the best males, in order<br />\nto maintain the proper social<br />\norder.

Many<br />\ncolleges run non-profit bookstores, often giving a 10% discount on all books sold to students.

The<br />\nJays took the court and started<br />\nout-hustling them from the start.<br />\nCoach Ciccarone put Will Lane<br />\non their big scorer and he got one<br />\nfield goal all night. At the end of<br />\nthe first half we were on top<br />\n36-29.<br />\nPulled Away<br />\nThe first half was pretty close,<br />\nmainly due to Lebanon Valley's<br />\ndeadly shooting, but the Jays had<br />\nmore shots and gradually pulled<br />\naway. Joe Carlton and Will Lane<br />\nrebounded well, but the big thing<br />\nis the Jay's ball-hawking. Almost<br />\nevery time there was a loose ball,<br />\nwe got it. The Jay's aggressive<br />\nman-to-man defense stole the<br />\nball, often before Lebanon Valley<br />\ncould get off a shot.
