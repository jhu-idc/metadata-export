By<br />\nour calculations, considering that the concert was attended<br />\nby only abou', 80 people, it works out to the incredible<br />\nfigure of $12.50 a head.<br />\nThe concert appears to be the product of sheer folly<br />\nand incompetent planning by the three sponsoring class's<br />\nofficers. They were simply duped. We are unable to<br />\nunderstand how a secondary artist rated a fee equivalent<br />\nto that paid to such first-rate performers as Nina Simone<br />\nand Odetta, both of whom played before near capacity<br />\ncrowds in concerts which were nothing short of booming<br />\nsuccesses. These two concerts were the result of highly<br />\ncompetent and experienced planning and promotion by<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire. The Gibson concert lacked all<br />\nthese factors.<br />\nFirst, the performance lacked adequate and accurate<br />\npublicity. The posters went up only a short time before<br />\nthe actual date, and it was billed as a \"jazz concert,\" Bob<br />\nGibson's name being relegated to much smaller type. Second, there was no reason in the world why it shouldn't<br />\nhave been held out in the bright sun as originally planned.<br />\nFinally, the transferral of the concert to one of the local<br />\nfraternity houses is of questionable validity in a class<br />\nsponsored affair.<br />\nIn any case, the $1,000 is already spent and gone. We<br />\nonly hope this is not an indication of the type of incompetence and bungling to be expected next year from our<br />\nstudent leaders. $1,000 could have bought a great deal<br />\nof much needed facilities on this campus, acknowledged<br />\nfor its deficiency in undergraduate provisions.<br />\n<br />\nA Second Proposal<br />\nThe slogan on the Homewood campus this year has<br />\nbeen Apathy, and rightly so. But the solution to this problem does not lie in recriminations, nor is it the fault of the<br />\nAdmissions Office. After all, how excited can a student<br />\nbe in a class election or SC election. The only issues are<br />\nones of personality.<br />\nAs Hegel pointed out in his Philosophy of Right, for<br />\neffective government there must be a mediating body between the citizen and the government. And this body is<br />\nthe political party.<br />\nAssuming Hopkins student government had political<br />\nparties, there can be no doubt that the student would have<br />\nmore interest in his own government. In this case there<br />\nwould be legitimate issues in the government, and, more<br />\nimportantly, each student would have the opportunity to<br />\nbecome involved in his government through his party.<br />\nTo establish such parties would be quite easy. Representation in the student council would be by party only.<br />\nEach party would receive delegates in proportion to its<br />\ntotal vote,-and delegates would be named from lists submitted by the party in advance.<br />\nThus the student would not only be voting for individuals but also for parties and platforms. The popularity<br />\npolls we now have would be substituted for by issues and<br />\nideas.<br />\nAt the moment the individual student is virtually<br />\npowerless to effect any change in student government.<br />\nThe best he can do is to vote for those men whom he<br />\nhopes will in some way agree with his views. But in a<br />\nparty system the student could vote for the party which<br />\nbest represents his beliefs and ideas.<br />\nIn essence, the formation of political parties on the<br />\nHopkins campus would have three beneficial results. The<br />\nfirst is that elections would no longer be the farce that<br />\nthey are now. Secondly, the student body would have<br />\nthe opportunity to actually participate in and determine<br />\nthe course of their own government. And finally, the major<br />\ncause for apathy, the warranted lack of interest in an<br />\nimpersonal and remote government, would be removed.<br />\n<br />\nMake Mine Pink<br />\nThe latest in contests: College student entrants<br />\naspiring to win the $1000 first prize in the Martex Scholarship Award Color Contest are asked to submit a \"25-word<br />\nstatement on the color they prefer in their bathroom, and<br />\nwhy.\" \u2014<br />\n<br />\nMore<br />\n<br />\nackstage Whispers<br />\n<br />\nBy HUNTER FARNHAM<br />\nBowl Team Member<br />\nSunday noon: The first practice session is<br />\nover\u2014Hopkins 290, Montana State University 40.<br />\nThe teams are eating in the Satire Room of the<br />\nPark-Sheraton (Producer Jack Cleary's idea of<br />\na joke?).

Not only did they<br />\nwitness a first-rate production,<br />\nbut they also received a chance<br />\nto view the work of a young<br />\nplaywright who many feel will<br />\nlead the American Theatre out<br />\nof its current commercialized<br />\nwilderness. Mr. Albee attacks an<br />\nimportant problem that is typical of much of America today:<br />\nthe failure of people to find a<br />\nmeans of communication with the<br />\nanother. And though The Zoo<br />\nStory may be largely allegorical<br />\nand its characters symbolic, they<br />\nare so lucidly sketched, and endowed with such crackling dialogue that the audience never<br />\nloses interest in them as characters.<br />\n\"The American dream,\" stated<br />\nAlbee in a recent interview, \"is<br />\nthe substitution of artificial<br />\nvalues for real values ... People<br />\ntry so hard to escape being<br />\ntouched by unpleasantness that<br />\nthey wind up being unable to<br />\nfeel anything or communicate<br />\nanything.\" With this in mind,<br />\nAlbee sets his scene in Central<br />\nPark where Peter, well-to-do,<br />\nmiddle-aged textbook publisher<br />\nis seated on a bench, complacently reading a book. His Sunday afternoon serenity is disturbed when Jerry, a young,<br />\nshabbily dressed man abruptly<br />\nattempts to engage him in a<br />\nform of conversation. Jerry first<br />\nplumbs his background: we learn<br />\nthat Peter lives in a smart neighborhood on one side of the park<br />\nwith his wife, two daughters<br />\ntwo cats, and two parakeets. In<br />\ncontrast, Jerry lives alone in a<br />\ndilapidated rooming house on<br />\nthe other side of the park. Judgeing from the subjects that Jerry<br />\ntalks about, one feels that he<br />\nconsiders himself completely<br />\nisolated from the people around<br />\nhim. The crucial segment of his<br />\ndialogue is \"The Story of Jerry<br />\nand the Dog\" in which Jerry<br />\ntells Peter how he attempted to<br />\nplacate his landlady's dog who<br />\nfor some reason felt a strong<br />\nantipathy towards him. After a<br />\ndaily peace offering of meat<br />\n<br />\nfailed to pacify the beast, Jerry<br />\ndecided to poison it. But Jerry<br />\nexplains to an almost hypnotized<br />\nPeter that, though he tried to<br />\nkill the dog, he was overjoyed<br />\nwhen it recovered, for he desperately desired to find out<br />\nwhat their new relationship<br />\nwould amount to. The result was<br />\na standoff, with neither showing<br />\nany affirmative or negative<br />\nemotions; nevertheless Jerry is<br />\nsatisfied, for finally he has<br />\nbroken down all barriers, all<br />\npretentions, and made true contact with the dog \u2014 a situation<br />\nthat he finds impossible to establish with people.<br />\nBut Peter does not understand.<br />\nHe finds the story strongly disconcerting. His refusal to comprehend disgusts Jerry so much<br />\nthat the latter attempts to<br />\n<br />\narouse Peter out of his superficial state by physically forcing<br />\nhim to react. By running himself in on a knife Peter is holding, Jerry finally manages, as<br />\nboth men scream almost simultaneously to create an emotional bond with Peter\u2014but at<br />\nthe cost of his own life.<br />\n<br />\nGoucher Aides\u2014<br />\nThe News Letter was very<br />\nfortunate this week in being<br />\naided and abetted in its<br />\njournalistic endeavors by students of Goucher College.

At this conference the plans<br />\nfor the operation were completely revised. By 4 the LAU was<br />\nready to swing into action.<br />\nThe fearless leader and operative two acted as the advance<br />\nguard. In order to get through<br />\nthe 10 ft. fence with barbed<br />\nwire at the top and bottom, operative three held the barbed wire<br />\nup and the fearless leader<br />\ncrawled underneath losing only<br />\none pair of pants.<br />\nBy this time it was milking<br />\n<br />\ntime at the farm and the fearless<br />\nleader was forced to pretend to<br />\nmilk cows while conducting his<br />\noperations.<br />\nStage Set<br />\nOnce inside the leader sawed<br />\nthrough approximately 25 wires<br />\non the fence and cut the barbed<br />\nwire at the bottom. The stage<br />\nwas now set for the actual abduction.<br />\nThe oriental eperative chased<br />\nthe goat around the compound<br />\nand finally forced him inside his<br />\nhut. At this point the leader<br />\nclimbed on the back of the goat,<br />\noperative number three grabbed a<br />\nhorn, and the two of them drove<br />\nhim out through the hole in<br />\nthe fence into a meadow.<br />\nThe LAU now deposited the<br />\ngoat in the back of their getaway car (causing severe damage to the upholstery and the<br />\ncommand unit effected their<br />\nescape.<br />\nThe goat was taken to a farm<br />\nnear York, Pennsylvania and was<br />\nhoused there during Thursday<br />\nand early Friday.<br />\nFirst Error<br />\nMeanwhile, back on the Hopkins campus the LAU made their<br />\nfirst major error.

By<br />\nour calculations, considering that the concert was attended<br />\nby only abou', 80 people, it works out to the incredible<br />\nfigure of $12.50 a head.<br />\nThe concert appears to be the product of sheer folly<br />\nand incompetent planning by the three sponsoring class's<br />\nofficers. They were simply duped. We are unable to<br />\nunderstand how a secondary artist rated a fee equivalent<br />\nto that paid to such first-rate performers as Nina Simone<br />\nand Odetta, both of whom played before near capacity<br />\ncrowds in concerts which were nothing short of booming<br />\nsuccesses. These two concerts were the result of highly<br />\ncompetent and experienced planning and promotion by<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire. The Gibson concert lacked all<br />\nthese factors.<br />\nFirst, the performance lacked adequate and accurate<br />\npublicity. The posters went up only a short time before<br />\nthe actual date, and it was billed as a \"jazz concert,\" Bob<br />\nGibson's name being relegated to much smaller type. Second, there was no reason in the world why it shouldn't<br />\nhave been held out in the bright sun as originally planned.<br />\nFinally, the transferral of the concert to one of the local<br />\nfraternity houses is of questionable validity in a class<br />\nsponsored affair.<br />\nIn any case, the $1,000 is already spent and gone. We<br />\nonly hope this is not an indication of the type of incompetence and bungling to be expected next year from our<br />\nstudent leaders. $1,000 could have bought a great deal<br />\nof much needed facilities on this campus, acknowledged<br />\nfor its deficiency in undergraduate provisions.<br /><br />\nA Second Proposal<br />\nThe slogan on the Homewood campus this year has<br />\nbeen Apathy, and rightly so. But the solution to this problem does not lie in recriminations, nor is it the fault of the<br />\nAdmissions Office. After all, how excited can a student<br />\nbe in a class election or SC election. The only issues are<br />\nones of personality.<br />\nAs Hegel pointed out in his Philosophy of Right, for<br />\neffective government there must be a mediating body between the citizen and the government. And this body is<br />\nthe political party.<br />\nAssuming Hopkins student government had political<br />\nparties, there can be no doubt that the student would have<br />\nmore interest in his own government. In this case there<br />\nwould be legitimate issues in the government, and, more<br />\nimportantly, each student would have the opportunity to<br />\nbecome involved in his government through his party.<br />\nTo establish such parties would be quite easy. Representation in the student council would be by party only.<br />\nEach party would receive delegates in proportion to its<br />\ntotal vote,-and delegates would be named from lists submitted by the party in advance.<br />\nThus the student would not only be voting for individuals but also for parties and platforms. The popularity<br />\npolls we now have would be substituted for by issues and<br />\nideas.<br />\nAt the moment the individual student is virtually<br />\npowerless to effect any change in student government.<br />\nThe best he can do is to vote for those men whom he<br />\nhopes will in some way agree with his views. But in a<br />\nparty system the student could vote for the party which<br />\nbest represents his beliefs and ideas.<br />\nIn essence, the formation of political parties on the<br />\nHopkins campus would have three beneficial results. The<br />\nfirst is that elections would no longer be the farce that<br />\nthey are now. Secondly, the student body would have<br />\nthe opportunity to actually participate in and determine<br />\nthe course of their own government. And finally, the major<br />\ncause for apathy, the warranted lack of interest in an<br />\nimpersonal and remote government, would be removed.<br /><br />\nMake Mine Pink<br />\nThe latest in contests: College student entrants<br />\naspiring to win the $1000 first prize in the Martex Scholarship Award Color Contest are asked to submit a \"25-word<br />\nstatement on the color they prefer in their bathroom, and<br />\nwhy.\" \u2014<br /><br />\nMore<br /><br />\nackstage Whispers<br /><br />\nBy HUNTER FARNHAM<br />\nBowl Team Member<br />\nSunday noon: The first practice session is<br />\nover\u2014Hopkins 290, Montana State University 40.<br />\nThe teams are eating in the Satire Room of the<br />\nPark-Sheraton (Producer Jack Cleary's idea of<br />\na joke?).

Welcome aboard!<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nAlbee's The Zoo Story Enacted<br />\nIn arnstormers Presentation<br />\nBy BOB LANDAU<br />\nThose of the Hopkins community who were fortunate<br />\nenough to see the Barnstormer's<br />\nproduction of Edward Albee's<br />\nThe Zoo Story are a much enriched group. Not only did they<br />\nwitness a first-rate production,<br />\nbut they also received a chance<br />\nto view the work of a young<br />\nplaywright who many feel will<br />\nlead the American Theatre out<br />\nof its current commercialized<br />\nwilderness. Mr. Albee attacks an<br />\nimportant problem that is typical of much of America today:<br />\nthe failure of people to find a<br />\nmeans of communication with the<br />\nanother. And though The Zoo<br />\nStory may be largely allegorical<br />\nand its characters symbolic, they<br />\nare so lucidly sketched, and endowed with such crackling dialogue that the audience never<br />\nloses interest in them as characters.<br />\n\"The American dream,\" stated<br />\nAlbee in a recent interview, \"is<br />\nthe substitution of artificial<br />\nvalues for real values ... People<br />\ntry so hard to escape being<br />\ntouched by unpleasantness that<br />\nthey wind up being unable to<br />\nfeel anything or communicate<br />\nanything.\" With this in mind,<br />\nAlbee sets his scene in Central<br />\nPark where Peter, well-to-do,<br />\nmiddle-aged textbook publisher<br />\nis seated on a bench, complacently reading a book. His Sunday afternoon serenity is disturbed when Jerry, a young,<br />\nshabbily dressed man abruptly<br />\nattempts to engage him in a<br />\nform of conversation. Jerry first<br />\nplumbs his background: we learn<br />\nthat Peter lives in a smart neighborhood on one side of the park<br />\nwith his wife, two daughters<br />\ntwo cats, and two parakeets. In<br />\ncontrast, Jerry lives alone in a<br />\ndilapidated rooming house on<br />\nthe other side of the park. Judgeing from the subjects that Jerry<br />\ntalks about, one feels that he<br />\nconsiders himself completely<br />\nisolated from the people around<br />\nhim. The crucial segment of his<br />\ndialogue is \"The Story of Jerry<br />\nand the Dog\" in which Jerry<br />\ntells Peter how he attempted to<br />\nplacate his landlady's dog who<br />\nfor some reason felt a strong<br />\nantipathy towards him. After a<br />\ndaily peace offering of meat<br /><br />\nfailed to pacify the beast, Jerry<br />\ndecided to poison it. But Jerry<br />\nexplains to an almost hypnotized<br />\nPeter that, though he tried to<br />\nkill the dog, he was overjoyed<br />\nwhen it recovered, for he desperately desired to find out<br />\nwhat their new relationship<br />\nwould amount to. The result was<br />\na standoff, with neither showing<br />\nany affirmative or negative<br />\nemotions; nevertheless Jerry is<br />\nsatisfied, for finally he has<br />\nbroken down all barriers, all<br />\npretentions, and made true contact with the dog \u2014 a situation<br />\nthat he finds impossible to establish with people.<br />\nBut Peter does not understand.<br />\nHe finds the story strongly disconcerting. His refusal to comprehend disgusts Jerry so much<br />\nthat the latter attempts to<br /><br />\narouse Peter out of his superficial state by physically forcing<br />\nhim to react. By running himself in on a knife Peter is holding, Jerry finally manages, as<br />\nboth men scream almost simultaneously to create an emotional bond with Peter\u2014but at<br />\nthe cost of his own life.<br /><br />\nGoucher Aides\u2014<br />\nThe News Letter was very<br />\nfortunate this week in being<br />\naided and abetted in its<br />\njournalistic endeavors by students of Goucher College.

At this conference the plans<br />\nfor the operation were completely revised. By 4 the LAU was<br />\nready to swing into action.<br />\nThe fearless leader and operative two acted as the advance<br />\nguard. In order to get through<br />\nthe 10 ft. fence with barbed<br />\nwire at the top and bottom, operative three held the barbed wire<br />\nup and the fearless leader<br />\ncrawled underneath losing only<br />\none pair of pants.<br />\nBy this time it was milking<br /><br />\ntime at the farm and the fearless<br />\nleader was forced to pretend to<br />\nmilk cows while conducting his<br />\noperations.<br />\nStage Set<br />\nOnce inside the leader sawed<br />\nthrough approximately 25 wires<br />\non the fence and cut the barbed<br />\nwire at the bottom. The stage<br />\nwas now set for the actual abduction.<br />\nThe oriental eperative chased<br />\nthe goat around the compound<br />\nand finally forced him inside his<br />\nhut. At this point the leader<br />\nclimbed on the back of the goat,<br />\noperative number three grabbed a<br />\nhorn, and the two of them drove<br />\nhim out through the hole in<br />\nthe fence into a meadow.<br />\nThe LAU now deposited the<br />\ngoat in the back of their getaway car (causing severe damage to the upholstery and the<br />\ncommand unit effected their<br />\nescape.<br />\nThe goat was taken to a farm<br />\nnear York, Pennsylvania and was<br />\nhoused there during Thursday<br />\nand early Friday.<br />\nFirst Error<br />\nMeanwhile, back on the Hopkins campus the LAU made their<br />\nfirst major error.
