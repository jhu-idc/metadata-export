Perhaps, as a result of our newly established sports policy\u2014a plan which had been in the process of development for<br />\na number of years, we have been influenced in our scheduling of teams more<br />\nby scholastic reputations than by athletic abilities. Hence our present leaning<br />\ntoward the Pennsylvania schools.<br />\nThere is no doubt in anyone's mind that Haverford and Swarthmore<br />\nare more our scholastic equals than any of the establishments with whom<br />\nwe have had dealings in recent years. And now it appears that those same<br />\nschools are more our athletic \u201eequals than some of our past opponents have<br />\nproved to be. Where-once we Pound ourselves anxiously awaiting contests<br />\nwith such teams as Maryland and Washington, now we discover that our<br />\ncompetition with the Terps has almost entirely ceased, while that with<br />\nWashington College is on the way to depletion.<br />\nInstead we are aware of the increasing interest and excitement evident<br />\nin preparation for games with our new Philadelphia rivals. Our pigskin representatives are at present, besides rejoicing over their latest football experience, anticipating their coming battle with the maroon-clad warriors of<br />\nSwarthmore. The fact that they cannot'forget last year's 40-19 defeat up<br />\nat the Swarthmore field is further proof of their newly acquired spirit.<br />\nBy the way, in reviewing that mad football,scramble of last year, it is<br />\nwell to be reminded that the two squads were not as far apart as the score<br />\nindicates. Swarthmore's forty points were run up in a moment of our weakness\u2014 so to speak; and during the second pair, in which our heroes managed<br />\nto find themselves, Swarthmore not only returned nineteen of her points, but<br />\ndeposited at least twe or three gallons of cold sweat as well.<br />\nThe next few years will see whether there will be a shift in our traditional attachments.

Perhaps, as a result of our newly established sports policy\u2014a plan which had been in the process of development for<br />\na number of years, we have been influenced in our scheduling of teams more<br />\nby scholastic reputations than by athletic abilities. Hence our present leaning<br />\ntoward the Pennsylvania schools.<br />\nThere is no doubt in anyone's mind that Haverford and Swarthmore<br />\nare more our scholastic equals than any of the establishments with whom<br />\nwe have had dealings in recent years. And now it appears that those same<br />\nschools are more our athletic \u201eequals than some of our past opponents have<br />\nproved to be. Where-once we Pound ourselves anxiously awaiting contests<br />\nwith such teams as Maryland and Washington, now we discover that our<br />\ncompetition with the Terps has almost entirely ceased, while that with<br />\nWashington College is on the way to depletion.<br />\nInstead we are aware of the increasing interest and excitement evident<br />\nin preparation for games with our new Philadelphia rivals. Our pigskin representatives are at present, besides rejoicing over their latest football experience, anticipating their coming battle with the maroon-clad warriors of<br />\nSwarthmore. The fact that they cannot'forget last year's 40-19 defeat up<br />\nat the Swarthmore field is further proof of their newly acquired spirit.<br />\nBy the way, in reviewing that mad football,scramble of last year, it is<br />\nwell to be reminded that the two squads were not as far apart as the score<br />\nindicates. Swarthmore's forty points were run up in a moment of our weakness\u2014 so to speak; and during the second pair, in which our heroes managed<br />\nto find themselves, Swarthmore not only returned nineteen of her points, but<br />\ndeposited at least twe or three gallons of cold sweat as well.<br />\nThe next few years will see whether there will be a shift in our traditional attachments.
