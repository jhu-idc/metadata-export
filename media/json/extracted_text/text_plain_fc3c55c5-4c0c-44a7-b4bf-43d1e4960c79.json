Eisenhower Symposium<br />\ntopics.<br />\nThe Council narrowly approved placing the proposed procedural changes on a student referendum next week.<br />\nThe proposed change, presented to the Council by Selections Committee head Andy<br />\nFredman, will mean less influence on the part of the student<br />\nbody in the selection of the<br />\nSymposium topic.<br />\nUnder the proposed system,<br />\nthe Selections Committee would<br />\nmake an initial screening of the<br />\nproposals, and then send at least<br />\n80 per cent of them to a student<br />\nreferendum. From the top three<br />\nvote-getters, the Selections Committee would choose the topic,<br />\nunless one of the Symposium<br />\nproposals receives a clear majority.<br />\nUnder the system presently<br />\nemployed, the Selections Committe narrows down the field of<br />\nproposals and undergraduates<br />\nthen select a topic through the<br />\nreferendum, with a plurality sufficient to win.<br />\nThe move to initiate a change<br />\nin the selection mechanism, according to Fredman, was \"not a<br />\nreaction to this year's Symposium.\"<br />\n\"Perspectives\" has come under<br />\ncriticism for -its execution as well<br />\n<br />\nas the very nature of the topic.<br />\nFredman said that the Selections Committee's move was not<br />\nprompted by any one thing in<br />\nparticular, although he admitted<br />\nthat this past year's Symposium<br />\n\"might have in some small way<br />\naffected the decision.\"<br />\nFredman said. that he personally intiated the move and stated<br />\nthat the idea was the result of his<br />\nobservations of the Symposium<br />\nfor the last four years and that<br />\n<br />\nno outside forces influenced his<br />\ndecision.<br />\nCombination<br />\nFredman asserted that the proposed change is a combination of<br />\nlast year's system and. that used<br />\n'n the six years before.

At present, there<br />\nare no plans to acquire additional<br />\nhousing space through either purchases or new construction,<br />\nJohnson said.<br />\n\"We are not sure of the [student]problem in regard to housing,\" she noted.<br />\nConcerning the possible University subsidy of student housing, President Muller commented<br />\n\"I think that that's not a very<br />\n<br />\nlikely alternative. I doubt we'd<br />\ndo it.\"<br />\n\"I think it would be better to<br />\nincrease student aid or raise faculty salaries rather than subsidize student housing,\" he added.<br />\nWhile Johnson affirmed the University's awareness of student<br />\nhousing concerns, she said that<br />\nher office has not yet been given<br />\na copy of the housing report by<br />\nthe Student Council Housing<br />\nCommittee headed by Mike Lenardo.<br />\nA March 10 meeting is scheduled for both University officials<br />\nand representatives of the Greater Homewood Community Corporation to air their views on the<br />\nhousing problems.<br />\n<br />\nTo bring student sentiment to<br />\nbear at that meeting, Johnson<br />\nsaid she would like to have a copy of the report as soon as possible.<br />\nAt present, the Univeristy is<br />\n\"under the impression that housing is an umbrella term for different concerns the students have.She added,\"We know students<br />\nwant more of something. But is it<br />\nmore quantity or more quality?<br />\nWithout some sort of firm statement we are lost.\"<br />\nCommenting on the decision<br />\nto use the recently purchased<br />\nGladwyn Manor appartments at<br />\n3201 North Charles for office<br />\nspace rather than student housing, Johnson stated, \"We could<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\nsystem<br />\n<br />\nJanet Johnson\u2022<br />\n$170,500 with the stipulation<br />\nthat it would be used mainly for<br />\noffice space.<br />\nJohnson revealed that a lower<br />\nprice could have been obtained if<br />\nthe University had agreed to use<br />\nthe apartment for residential use.<br />\n<br />\nAnalysis: BAC is reduced to priorities<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nThe Student Council's Budget<br />\nAdviiory Committee, once intended to relay specific budget recommendations, has been reduced to a general priority committee, following a series of disagreements with Homewood Vice President George Benton over access<br />\n<br />\nto the University budget.<br />\nWhen first proposed by thenStudent Council Treasurer Jon<br />\nTillem and Eric Rasmussen, student assistant to the Homewood<br />\nVice President, the BAC was heralded as a major breakthrough in<br />\nstudent-administrative relations.<br />\nIn the original _draft of the propo-<br />\n<br />\nFinancial aid comes under fire<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nA soon-to-be-released repori<br />\nfrom the Student'Council Finan.<br />\n.cial Committee calls for revisions<br />\nin the current method of fin<br />\nancial aid allocation for undergraduates at Hopkins.<br />\n\"We have a choice of allowinE<br />\nHopkins to become a rich man's<br />\nschool or maintaining a cross<br />\nsection of all kinds of students,\"<br />\nstated Erik Molander, Committee<br />\nchairman.<br />\nMolander asserted that if Hopkins is to attract the best students from all financial strata, the<br />\nUniversity should go to a<br />\nof increased financial aid,<br />\n.to be given out more equally.\"<br />\nThe Committee Chairman called the present method of allocating aid to freshmen a \"form<br />\nof merit scholarships.\"<br />\n\"Incoming freshmen are ranked by the Admissions Office on a<br />\nscore of 1 to 15 and from these<br />\nrankings the mixture of grants,<br />\nloans and work-study aid is determined,\" Molander said.<br />\nHe asserted that the total<br />\namount of aid is determined by<br />\nthe Parent's Confidential Statement, but that Hopkins hag the<br />\n\"latitude to award students who<br />\nthe University really wants, to re<br />\nceive more grants and scholar.<br />\nships and less loans and workstudy allocations.\"<br />\n\"This is a form of merit<br />\nscholarships and I think it's a rotten idea,\" Molander stated.<br />\nThe Committee chairman revealed that his committee also<br />\nfound that the freshman class<br />\ngets a disproportionately large<br />\namount of aid.<br />\n\"This year, the freshmen are<br />\nget ting one-third of the total<br />\namount of financial aid for Arts<br />\nand Sciences,- lie said.<br />\nMolander said tha le reason<br />\nfor the inequality<br />\n.tat fresh-<br />\n<br />\nhave bought it for residential use<br />\nbut rent charges would have been<br />\nexcessive.\"<br />\nFor unspecified reason, the<br />\nUniversity chose not to purchase<br />\nthe building outright.

Wayne<br />\nHood that the outlook for next<br />\nyear's financial aid is good.<br />\n\"We expect $15 million in federal money and are hoping for<br />\n$1.6 million from Hopkins,\"<br />\nMolander said.<br />\nHe indicated that presently<br />\n$1.2 million in Univeristy funds<br />\nhave been promised, but outside<br />\nscholarships are expected to increase from $100,000 to<br />\n$400,000.<br />\n\"If this money is received, it<br />\nwould meet our total need for<br />\nundergraduate aid,\" he noted.<br />\nThe Committee Chairman also<br />\nrevealed that the report lauds the<br />\nexit interview, instituted this<br />\nyear, to explain to graduating<br />\nseniors their financial aid debts<br />\nand responsibilities.<br />\n<br />\nsal, however, the issue of access<br />\nto actual budgets was dealt with<br />\nsparsely.<br />\nSkirmishes<br />\nAfter several skirmishes with<br />\nBenton, the panel has yet to determine whether in principle it<br />\nshould be permitted to see budget figures, and if, in fact, it ever<br />\nwill. Panel members, though, are<br />\nunanimous in their disappointment with the committee's fate.<br />\nBoth SC Secretary Leah<br />\nSeidenfeld and SC Treasurer Alan<br />\nFink, who co-chair the committee, pronounced themselves \"dissatisfied\" with the BAC in its<br />\npresent role.<br />\n\"I thought it would be an important committee,\" remarked<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\nLeah Stidenfeld<br />\n<br />\nSolomon discusses outside fat<br />\nBy STEVEN DUBNER<br />\n\"Are you fat on the outside<br />\nand starving on the inside?

This has resulted from<br />\na talent for providing continually more powerful engines<br />\nfor the majority of commercial aircraft operated by airlines of the free-world.<br />\nD Perhaps a significant factor has been the planned diversification into non-aircraft fields.

But Hopkins, being<br />\nan institution of higher education<br />\nshares in common with other institutions its established tradition for<br />\nceremonials and being generally<br />\nimpressed with such ceremonials<br />\nwhen done well, I engaged myself<br />\nto work as an usher at the Commemoration Day exercises in Shriven Hall, held on February 21.<br />\nMy attitude at first had been<br />\none of mercenary indifference.

They were no longer \"those<br />\neccentric egomaniacs in the English<br />\nDepartment\" or the \"temperamental old fogies in the department of<br />\nChemistry\" but instead gentlemen<br />\nof breeding and refinement called<br />\nupon to preserve the heritage of<br />\nlearned wisdom handed down to us<br />\nby the Greeks and Romans.<br />\nIn one moment I was swept<br />\naway in the euphoria of intellectual idealism and academic romanticism.

The Hue Jays did not<br />\nfield a participant at the 158,<br />\n177, and HWT positions. Of the<br />\nremaining grapplers in the tournament, Gary Murza became the<br />\nfirst Hopkins wrestler to ever<br />\ncapture a championship.

Both men were<br />\non their feet at the end of the<br />\nperiod with the score 3-1. Lazzaro worked for an escape in the<br />\nfinal period but was unable to<br />\ntake Preefer down for the remainder of the match.

Starting down in the<br />\nfinal period, Murza started to<br />\nswitch Zanko but was momentarily stopped near his back. The<br />\nreferee awarded Zanko two<br />\npoints for a near fall. Immediately both mat judges stood up to<br />\noppose the questionable call. The<br />\nmatch continued and Murza finished his switch gaining the reversal. Zanko came back with a<br />\nreversal and a predicament to<br />\nmove into the lead with the disputed points. Murza was able to<br />\nreverse Zanko and the match was<br />\nstopped with three seconds left<br />\nfor the referee and mat judges to<br />\nconfer on Zanko's first two<br />\npointer.

Before they can move to collectivized bargaining, the State Legislature must<br />\napprove the move; and there are several<br />\nbills currently pending in the Legislature<br />\nwhich would allow for unionization<br />\nthere.<br />\nAt Harvard, even, the possibility exists,<br />\nas the faculty has organized a committee<br />\nto investigate the feasibility of such action.<br />\nAt Hopkins, however, where the average faculty salary has dropped in terms of<br />\nreal dollars for the last four years, all<br />\nsigns indicate that there is little interest in<br />\nunionization, let alone any action being<br />\nundertaken toward that end.<br />\nThe explanation given for the lack of a<br />\nunionizing effort here has been strikingly<br />\nconsistent: Hopkins is small enough for<br />\nindividuals to approach the administration, including the President, with their<br />\ngreivances.<br />\nSaid Dr. Richard Joseph, Electrical Engineering, \"It's still possible to talk to<br />\npeople here.

At present, there<br />\nare no plans to acquire additional<br />\nhousing space through either purchases or new construction,<br />\nJohnson said.<br />\n\"We are not sure of the [student]problem in regard to housing,\" she noted.<br />\nConcerning the possible University subsidy of student housing, President Muller commented<br />\n\"I think that that's not a very<br /><br />\nlikely alternative. I doubt we'd<br />\ndo it.\"<br />\n\"I think it would be better to<br />\nincrease student aid or raise faculty salaries rather than subsidize student housing,\" he added.<br />\nWhile Johnson affirmed the University's awareness of student<br />\nhousing concerns, she said that<br />\nher office has not yet been given<br />\na copy of the housing report by<br />\nthe Student Council Housing<br />\nCommittee headed by Mike Lenardo.<br />\nA March 10 meeting is scheduled for both University officials<br />\nand representatives of the Greater Homewood Community Corporation to air their views on the<br />\nhousing problems.<br /><br />\nTo bring student sentiment to<br />\nbear at that meeting, Johnson<br />\nsaid she would like to have a copy of the report as soon as possible.<br />\nAt present, the Univeristy is<br />\n\"under the impression that housing is an umbrella term for different concerns the students have.She added,\"We know students<br />\nwant more of something. But is it<br />\nmore quantity or more quality?<br />\nWithout some sort of firm statement we are lost.\"<br />\nCommenting on the decision<br />\nto use the recently purchased<br />\nGladwyn Manor appartments at<br />\n3201 North Charles for office<br />\nspace rather than student housing, Johnson stated, \"We could<br /><br />\n\"<br />\nsystem<br /><br />\nJanet Johnson\u2022<br />\n$170,500 with the stipulation<br />\nthat it would be used mainly for<br />\noffice space.<br />\nJohnson revealed that a lower<br />\nprice could have been obtained if<br />\nthe University had agreed to use<br />\nthe apartment for residential use.<br /><br />\nAnalysis: BAC is reduced to priorities<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nThe Student Council's Budget<br />\nAdviiory Committee, once intended to relay specific budget recommendations, has been reduced to a general priority committee, following a series of disagreements with Homewood Vice President George Benton over access<br /><br />\nto the University budget.<br />\nWhen first proposed by thenStudent Council Treasurer Jon<br />\nTillem and Eric Rasmussen, student assistant to the Homewood<br />\nVice President, the BAC was heralded as a major breakthrough in<br />\nstudent-administrative relations.<br />\nIn the original _draft of the propo-<br /><br />\nFinancial aid comes under fire<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nA soon-to-be-released repori<br />\nfrom the Student'Council Finan.<br />\n.cial Committee calls for revisions<br />\nin the current method of fin<br />\nancial aid allocation for undergraduates at Hopkins.<br />\n\"We have a choice of allowinE<br />\nHopkins to become a rich man's<br />\nschool or maintaining a cross<br />\nsection of all kinds of students,\"<br />\nstated Erik Molander, Committee<br />\nchairman.<br />\nMolander asserted that if Hopkins is to attract the best students from all financial strata, the<br />\nUniversity should go to a<br />\nof increased financial aid,<br />\n.to be given out more equally.\"<br />\nThe Committee Chairman called the present method of allocating aid to freshmen a \"form<br />\nof merit scholarships.\"<br />\n\"Incoming freshmen are ranked by the Admissions Office on a<br />\nscore of 1 to 15 and from these<br />\nrankings the mixture of grants,<br />\nloans and work-study aid is determined,\" Molander said.<br />\nHe asserted that the total<br />\namount of aid is determined by<br />\nthe Parent's Confidential Statement, but that Hopkins hag the<br />\n\"latitude to award students who<br />\nthe University really wants, to re<br />\nceive more grants and scholar.<br />\nships and less loans and workstudy allocations.\"<br />\n\"This is a form of merit<br />\nscholarships and I think it's a rotten idea,\" Molander stated.<br />\nThe Committee chairman revealed that his committee also<br />\nfound that the freshman class<br />\ngets a disproportionately large<br />\namount of aid.<br />\n\"This year, the freshmen are<br />\nget ting one-third of the total<br />\namount of financial aid for Arts<br />\nand Sciences,- lie said.<br />\nMolander said tha le reason<br />\nfor the inequality<br />\n.tat fresh-<br /><br />\nhave bought it for residential use<br />\nbut rent charges would have been<br />\nexcessive.\"<br />\nFor unspecified reason, the<br />\nUniversity chose not to purchase<br />\nthe building outright. Instead,<br />\nthe building is presently leased to<br />\nthe Univeristy by Broadway Management Corporation, which in<br />\nturn is leasing the building from<br />\nBroadway Development Corporation. This situation is unusual<br />\nsince principal holdings of both<br />\ncompanies are in East Baltimore.<br />\n\"Initially the building came to<br />\nour attention through the death<br />\nof the owner.

Wayne<br />\nHood that the outlook for next<br />\nyear's financial aid is good.<br />\n\"We expect $15 million in federal money and are hoping for<br />\n$1.6 million from Hopkins,\"<br />\nMolander said.<br />\nHe indicated that presently<br />\n$1.2 million in Univeristy funds<br />\nhave been promised, but outside<br />\nscholarships are expected to increase from $100,000 to<br />\n$400,000.<br />\n\"If this money is received, it<br />\nwould meet our total need for<br />\nundergraduate aid,\" he noted.<br />\nThe Committee Chairman also<br />\nrevealed that the report lauds the<br />\nexit interview, instituted this<br />\nyear, to explain to graduating<br />\nseniors their financial aid debts<br />\nand responsibilities.<br /><br />\nsal, however, the issue of access<br />\nto actual budgets was dealt with<br />\nsparsely.<br />\nSkirmishes<br />\nAfter several skirmishes with<br />\nBenton, the panel has yet to determine whether in principle it<br />\nshould be permitted to see budget figures, and if, in fact, it ever<br />\nwill. Panel members, though, are<br />\nunanimous in their disappointment with the committee's fate.<br />\nBoth SC Secretary Leah<br />\nSeidenfeld and SC Treasurer Alan<br />\nFink, who co-chair the committee, pronounced themselves \"dissatisfied\" with the BAC in its<br />\npresent role.<br />\n\"I thought it would be an important committee,\" remarked<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\nLeah Stidenfeld<br /><br />\nSolomon discusses outside fat<br />\nBy STEVEN DUBNER<br />\n\"Are you fat on the outside<br />\nand starving on the inside? According to Dr. Neil Solomon,<br />\nSecretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental<br />\nHygiene, over half of the people<br />\nin the United States fall into this<br />\ncategory.<br />\nAddressing a group at the Wednesday Noon Series, lie made several comments on health and<br />\nproper nutrition.<br />\nCiting a recent study by the<br />\nU.S. Department of Agriculture,<br />\nSolomon stated that over one<br />\nhalf of the country's population<br />\n\"are not getting optimal amounts<br />\nof vitamins and minerals.- An-<br /><br />\nother study he cited found that<br />\n\"33 percent of Americans- were<br />\nobese..weighing more than 10<br />\npercent of their ideal weight.\"<br />\nAn expert on dieting and nutrition, he stressed the importance of proper foods and exercise in weight control. Solomon<br />\nalso cautioned against \"crash-fad<br />\ndiets,\" stating \"If you go on a<br />\ndiet that cuts down on the number of nutrients you need...you'll<br />\ndo it at thi\u2014xpense of some organ of your body.\"<br />\nBased on his own research.<br />\nSolomon has devised a diet which<br />\nhe said enables people to \"lose<br />\nfive to ten pounds a month of<br />\npure fat- without endangering<br /><br />\ntheir health. Throughout his talk<br />\nhe made reference to a case<br />\nwhere, over the course of twelve<br />\nmonths, a man went from 586<br />\npounds to 222 pounds. Solomon<br />\nsaid that this case motivated him<br />\nto develop his dietary plan.<br />\nAuthor<br />\nSolomon, head of the largest<br />\nstate agency, holds degrees in<br />\nmedicine, biomedical science,<br />\nand physiology, is the author of<br />\nover fifty articles and one book,<br />\nand hosts a radio and television<br />\nshow.<br />\nQuestions<br />\nThe Health secretary's lecture<br />\nwas followed by a question and<br />\nanswer period for a few minutes.<br /><br />\nSeidenfeld. \"But as far as any say<br />\non the budgets, we haven't had<br />\nany.\"<br />\nFink concurred: \"I'm overall<br />\nvery disappointed with the outcome of the committee. We've<br />\nreally had to compromise our desires.\"<br />\nBut if the panel's run-ins with<br />\nBenton have proved frustrating,<br />\nthey have not been without their<br />\ncomic aspects. Last semester, the<br />\nBAC confronted Benton on the<br />\ntouchy issue of budget access.<br />\nThough Benton refused to grant<br />\nthe group permission to see any<br />\nbudget figures, the panel obtained several copies of the University's budget \"Blue book\" due to a<br />\nsuspicious misunderstanding with<br />\nthe Homewood Vice President.<br />\nAfter SC President Andy<br />\nSavitz announced at a Student<br />\nCouncil meeting that the BAC<br />\nhad gotten hold of a blue book<br />\n\"without the University's blessing,\" Benton publicly continued<br />\nto stand against students having<br />\naccess to budgetary information<br />\n\"in principle.\"<br />\nScenario<br />\nIn an interview earlier this semester, President Muller declined<br />\nto comment at length on the blue<br />\nbook scenario, noting wryly that<br />\n\"that is Benton's problem.\" Apparently bemused by the entire<br />\nBAC controversy, Muller expressed dismay at the problems encountered by the \"group of selfappointed studebt inquisitors.\"<br />\nThough disillusioned by<br />\nBenton's lack of cooperation, the<br />\npanel has continued to work hard<br />\nin its priorities capacity, offering<br />\nsuggestions for energy cuts and<br />\npreparing final reports on each of<br />\nthe student services departments.<br />\nSeidenfeld and Fink both said<br />\nthey think interaction with<br />\nBenton has been of benefit. \"I<br />\nthink it's good that at least there<br />\nare students talking to Benton in<br />\nan organized way,\" said<br />\nSeidenfeld.<br />\nThough both have hope that<br />\nthe panel will function more effectively next year, they conceded that the final word on the<br />\nBAC cannot be good.<br />\n\"Benton does discuss his plans<br />\nwith us and has Oven us some cooperation,\" said Seidenfeld. \"But<br />\nbasically , the administration<br />\nthrew us something that wasn't<br />\nworkable.\"<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/february 28, 1975<br /><br />\nTA's come under heavy fire in Academic Reports<br />\nBy JAY GOODGOLD<br /><br />\nIn one of the most detailed<br />\nand thorough sections of the<br />\nAcademic Reports, doubt is cast<br />\non the, responsibility and concern<br />\nteaching assistants exhibit toward<br />\nundergraduates.<br />\nThe Reports, now available to<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community in the Reserve Room of<br />\nthe MSE Library and the Hutzler<br />\nReading Room, devote a substantial portion of the introduction<br />\n\u2022to the inability of many teaching<br />\nassistants (TA's) to work with<br />\nundergraduates.

In many cases the teaching assistant does more harm<br />\nthan good; in the short run by<br />\nconfusing students, and in the<br />\nlong run by souring them on the<br />\no<br /><br />\nDl<br /><br />\nsubject,\" the Reports state.<br />\nUndergraduate dissatisfaction<br />\nwith the TA's, according to the<br />\nReports, mainly concerned the<br />\nfollowing: 1) TA's didn't care<br />\nwhat they were teaching, acting<br />\nas if teaching a section was a<br />\n\"burden\" and something to get<br />\nout of the way as quickly as possible; and 2) a general \"Bad Attitude\" displayed by the TA's.<br />\nDr. George Owen, dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences, in calling the<br />\nAcademic Reports \"one of the<br />\nbest and most thoughtful student<br />\nworks I've seen in 25 years,\" was<br />\nsympathetic to the Reports' suggestion concerning improvement<br />\nof the role of the teaching assis-<br /><br />\n\"I'd like to see TA's more<br />\nsupervised; the work of the TA<br />\nshould be watched carefully. It's<br />\nsimply a matter of justice to the<br />\nundergraduates,\" Owen added.<br />\nOther complaints leveled<br />\nagainst teaching assistants include<br />\ntheir lack of preparation for conference; their inability to speak<br />\nor comprehend the English language; their unwillingness to<br />\nmeet outside of class; and their<br />\n\"arbitrary\" way in which they<br />\ndispense grades to undergraduates.<br />\nConcerning the distribution of<br />\ngrades, some TA's disagree with<br />\nthe Reports conclusion.

A nationally known specialist in the<br />\nHistory of the American culture<br />\nand society in the 19th and 20th<br />\ncenturies, he joined the Johns<br />\nHopkins faculty in 1971.<br />\nHe is the author of a number<br />\nof influential works, including<br />\nStrangers in the Land, which<br />\nwon the Dunning Prize of the<br />\nAmerican Historical Association<br />\nand marked the beginning of an<br /><br />\nimportant shift in the historical<br />\nanalysis of immigration to the<br />\nUnited States.<br />\nAnother of his works, entitled<br />\nFrom Boundlessness to Consolidation and published in 1969,<br />\nled to major reconsiderations in<br />\nthe area of 19th-century American intellectual history. His most<br />\nrecent work is entitled Send<br />\nThese to Me: Jews and Other Immigrants in Urban America, to<br />\nbe published this spring.<br />\nOf his appointment to the<br />\nChair, Dr. Higham said that it<br />\nwill not alter his position on the<br />\nfaculty or his duties in any way.<br />\n\"It's primarily an honor,\" he<br /><br />\nnoted. \"I take it simply as a compliment. It's a certain assurance<br />\nof the faculty and administration's confidence in me.\"<br />\n\"It has no temporal or material value,\" he added.<br />\nHigham has held offices in a<br />\nnumber of professional organizations. In 1973-74 he was president of the Organization of American Historians. From 1970<br />\nto 1974 he was a member of the<br />\nCouncil and Executive Committee of the American Historical<br />\nAssociation and last year he<br />\nheaded its committee on<br />\nresearch. He was elected to the<br />\nAmerican Academy of Arts and<br /><br />\nSciences in 1972 and in 1972-73<br />\nwas a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting<br />\nScholar.

Many of the college graduates who join u decide to build satisfying lifetime careers in our organization.<br />\nWhy this decision?<br />\nE Perhaps because of the relative stability of Pratt &amp;<br />\nWhitney Aircraft over the years. This has resulted from<br />\na talent for providing continually more powerful engines<br />\nfor the majority of commercial aircraft operated by airlines of the free-world.<br />\nD Perhaps a significant factor has been the planned diversification into non-aircraft fields. For example, we have<br />\ndeveloped jet engines that now provide power for<br />\nutilities, high-speed trains, marine vessels, chemical<br />\ncomplexes and other applications.<br />\nCI Perhaps the emphasis on new products with exceptional<br />\ngrowth potential. Fuel cell powerplants that do not pollute the atmosphere and are far more efficient in producing energy from scarce fuel typify this aspect.<br />\nLi Perhaps an important plus has been a competitive salary<br />\nstructure and increasingly more important assignments<br />\nthat lead to attractive futures in management.<br /><br />\nID1 Perhaps most important, for many, has been the challenge of working at the frontiers of the art in virtually<br />\nevery technical and scientific field. Certainly, ability is<br />\ntested to the utmost in improving powerplants that can<br />\nlift their own weight plus additional thousands of pounds<br />\nof plane, passengers and cargo.

I 975Thaltimore.<br />\nmaryland179th year<br /><br />\nBy CHARLES HENDERSON<br />\nI suspect that few persons on<br />\ncampus have been as voracious in<br />\ntheir criticism of Hopkins as I<br />\nhave. I further suspect that my disenchantment has been made<br />\nreadily apparent in such organs of<br />\npublic information as the NewsLetter and in the course of private<br />\ndiscussion. Thus when the opportunity to take a vacation from such<br />\nconstant vituperation presents itself, and to take vicarious pleasure<br />\nin some event singular to Hopkins<br />\nlife, I am oddly enough always amenable.<br />\nOf late, the violent tenor of my<br />\ndistaste for this institution has become less marked and I find myself<br />\nfinding some pleasure in certain aspects of Hopkins life; its buildings<br />\n(grotesque as they are), its reputation (as exaggerated as it must be)<br />\nand no less oddly for its traditions.<br />\nI have fallen victim more than once<br />\nto the lure of lacrosse and am well<br />\naware of the violent energies to<br />\nwhich it caters. But Hopkins, being<br />\nan institution of higher education<br />\nshares in common with other institutions its established tradition for<br />\nceremonials and being generally<br />\nimpressed with such ceremonials<br />\nwhen done well, I engaged myself<br />\nto work as an usher at the Commemoration Day exercises in Shriven Hall, held on February 21.<br />\nMy attitude at first had been<br />\none of mercenary indifference. I<br />\nhad desired to dress up; the weather report lady said it was going to<br />\nbe a great day, and I figured that as<br />\nlong as I was dressing up, I might<br />\nas well pick up a few ducats.<br />\nOn the other hand, I had been<br />\nreading Thorstein Veblen's<br />\n\"Theory of the Leisure Class\" (a<br />\nmarvelous little book if you can<br />\nbear reading through it), a book<br />\nwhich I felt epitomized the tendency of the age to criticize anything<br /><br />\noh really?<br />\nThough the longstanding University policy of refusing to<br />\nsubsidize student housing is frequently aggravating to undergraduates, one treads on thin ice when attempting to evaluate<br />\nthe decisions of trained professionals like Real Property Investment Officer Janet Johnson. Given the complexity of<br />\nlarge scale property purchases and the enormous risks which<br />\nattend such endeavors in a strapped economy, we do not feel<br />\nqualified to contest the University's. decision, through<br />\nJohnson, to decline numerous offers to purchase buildings<br />\nwhich could have served to alleviate the shortage of student<br />\nhousing.<br />\nWe do feel, however, that the attitude taken by Johnson in<br />\nregard to the need for student housing does not represent an<br />\ninformed or productive one, especially if it speaks for the<br />\nadministration as-a whole.<br />\nThe perspective taken indicates, worse than ignorance,<br />\ncomplete obliviousness to the problem of student housing at<br />\nHopkins. \"We're not sure of the student problem in regard to<br />\nhousing,\" Johnson states. She later professes uncertainty as<br />\nto whether Hopkins students want quality or quan tity in<br />\nhousing, citing the lack of a \"definite statement\" as the root<br />\nof the administration's bewilderment.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThe problem \"in regard to\" student housing is a simple<br />\none. There isn't enough. And the overpriced, undermaintained Charles Village row houses arc not a tolerable alternative<br />\nto many.<br />\nIn light of the fact that there is no mentionable \"quantity\"<br />\nof student housing, it seems obvious that Hopkins students<br />\nwould opt for a bit of the latter before addressing themselves<br />\nto the relative \"quality\" of the present resources.<br />\nThe \"definitive statement\" the administration needs is forthcoming: The Student Council's housing. report, exhaustively researched and compiled by a special committee headed by<br />\nMike Lenard\u00b0.<br />\nWhen this report is released, perhaps then the administration will comprehend the problem of housing at Hopkins,<br />\nand undergraduate sentiment towards it\u2014issues which we and<br />\nmost all undergraduates had foolishly assumed to be patently<br />\nobvious.<br /><br />\nA rap with a Lachrymose Lad<br />\nBy NORMAN HENLEY<br />\nWith the gracious assistance of<br />\nthe johns Hopkins University's Departmetit of Spiritualism (my spe:(, 13,.

An alternative to the high book prices<br />\nat the JHU Bookcenter is Allen's Book<br />\nShop, located at thirty Third and University Avenue.<br />\nThe Bookshop, which opened last September 14, offers books for lower prices<br />\nthan any area book store. The owner,<br />\nAllen Atwood, was the former manager<br />\nof John Gach's used book store on Greenmount Avenue, as was often mistaken for<br />\nJohn Gach himself.<br />\nAtwood, a longtime resident of Baltimore, is a book collector and former<br />\nteacher. Although he admits that it is difficult to make a living selling used books,<br />\nhe is committed to the idea of a cheap<br />\nbook store. He is able to sell his books at<br />\nlow prices for a variety of reasons, the<br />\nmost significant of which is the high turnover rate of his books. Also, he buys from<br />\ncheap sources and obtains remainders<br />\nfrom book publishers. And he adds,\"Be- '<br />\nsides, I like playing Santa Claus.\"<br />\nAtwood continues: \"We have to face<br />\nthe facts, nine out of ten times, new<br />\nbooks are not available in area book<br />\nstores.\" To alleviate this situation, he intends to initiate a book ordering service.<br />\nMaintained on a low profit margin, in<br />\ncomparison to the standard book ordering service, it is essential that many facilitate this utility. For a small service<br />\ncharge, Atwood can obtain sets of books<br />\nat wholesale prices for his customers.<br />\nThe Hopkins community is responsible<br />\nfor much of the shop's business. Atwood<br />\nsaid that business decreased noticeably<br />\nduring the intersession period.<br /><br />\nAlways expanding his stock, Atwood is<br />\nlooking for books that are commonly<br />\nused at universities. He is increasing his<br />\nscience collection and buys regularly<br />\nfrom the Library of Congress. He hopes<br />\nthat further categorization and a wider<br />\nselection of books, as well as his ordering<br />\nservice, will attract more area students.<br />\nAllen's Bookshop is an unpretentious<br />\nand pleasant alternative to the Hopkins<br />\nBookcenter.

Before they can move to collectivized bargaining, the State Legislature must<br />\napprove the move; and there are several<br />\nbills currently pending in the Legislature<br />\nwhich would allow for unionization<br />\nthere.<br />\nAt Harvard, even, the possibility exists,<br />\nas the faculty has organized a committee<br />\nto investigate the feasibility of such action.<br />\nAt Hopkins, however, where the average faculty salary has dropped in terms of<br />\nreal dollars for the last four years, all<br />\nsigns indicate that there is little interest in<br />\nunionization, let alone any action being<br />\nundertaken toward that end.<br />\nThe explanation given for the lack of a<br />\nunionizing effort here has been strikingly<br />\nconsistent: Hopkins is small enough for<br />\nindividuals to approach the administration, including the President, with their<br />\ngreivances.<br />\nSaid Dr. Richard Joseph, Electrical Engineering, \"It's still possible to talk to<br />\npeople here.
