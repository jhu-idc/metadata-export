Such men \u2014 varied<br />\nenough in type\u2014are Norman Angell, H. G. Wells and Maximilian<br />\nHarden. For them, and for the<br />\nmen who are with them, nationality has become subordinate to the<br />\ninnate brotherhood of man; they<br />\nare trying, in sane, practical way,<br />\nto realize the creed taught by every<br />\ngreat religion the world has ever<br />\nproduced.<br />\nThe shibboleth of<br />\ntheir creed is law for all nations<br />\n\u2014the abolition of war. Whether<br />\nthe United States is drawn into<br />\nthe Great War or whether it is<br />\nnot, it is under this creed that we<br />\nmust enlist\u2014it is for us, the college men of America, to take the<br />\nlead in this country in proving<br />\nthat the beauty of an ideal is no<br />\nlonger sufficient cause for damning it as an impractical dream.<br />\n\u2022 The man at the head of our<br />\nCountry ioday is a Hopkins man.<br />\nAt the present moment, even with<br />\na reluctance which none can ever<br />\ndoubt, he is making ready for<br />\ncombat, he is the greatest teacher<br />\nof the creed among us.

When<br />\nthat time comes, if it is to come,<br />\nthe men of Our colleges will answer the appeal as enthusiastically as the men. of the European<br />\nuniversities responded to the call<br />\nof their governments, as enthusia4ically as volunteered the generations of American students before them in the War of S.ecession and the War with Spain.<br />\nSo much must we all do; that<br />\nis the easiest. What is the hardest, the most fundamental thing<br />\nof all, is for us to make ready for<br />\nwar, with the knowledge always<br />\nbefore us that we want, not war,<br />\nbut peace. We are grasping the<br />\nsword, not to extend the lines of<br />\nour boundaries, but to make evi-<br />\n<br />\nA Successful Innovation.<br />\n<br />\nEntirely apart from the fact<br />\nthat the mere ending of examinations is apt to cast an optimistic tinge over all philosophic reflections for the next few weeks<br />\nfollowing, there seems to be little<br />\ndissent in the University from the<br />\nopinion that the semester system<br />\n<br />\nwhich those examinations introduced is a distinct improvement<br />\nover the old three-term pldn.<br />\nIn the first place, of course,<br />\nthere is the obvious advantage of<br />\nhaving two sets of examinations<br />\nduring the year instead of three.<br />\nTheoretically, the midyears, coming a month or so later than did<br />\nthe first-term examinations under<br />\nthe old system, should necessitate<br />\nmore studying; but, in practice,<br />\nthe work of preparation for any<br />\nexaminations is heavy enough in<br />\nitself to make the additional review necessitated hardly noticeable\u2014the real strain of the examination period comes in the nervous tension engendered by its approach.<br />\nMoreover, under the present semester plan, with the end of the<br />\nmidyears, the work of the first<br />\nhalf year is definitely over\u2014there<br />\nis no frantic cramming of forgotten details at the last moment<br />\nbefore the finals, no doubling of<br />\nthe time of preparation needed<br />\nfor the first examinations. The<br />\nUniversity, under the present system, can face .the second half of<br />\nthe collegiate year with the satisfying knowledge that it has come<br />\nto a new leaf in reality, without<br />\nthe ghosts of the letters of previous chapters still hanging about<br />\nthe. pages.<br />\nMore and more, during the past<br />\nfew years, the undergraduate<br />\ncourses have been dividing themselves naturally, into parts\u2014philosophy, political economy II and<br />\nIII, several of the sciences \u2014 in<br />\nthese and many more there is a<br />\ndistinct break in the subject matter studied, which makes the division of the year into two parts<br />\ninstead of three far more satisfactory. In most of the large colleges, indeed, each undergraduate<br />\ncoutse is given for only a half<br />\nyear, the entire schedule of each<br />\nman being changed after midyears. The present Hopkins system is a very sane compromise\u2014<br />\ncourses comprehensive enough to<br />\nlast through the year, yet tending<br />\nnaturally to fall into two subdivisions.<br />\nThe Hopkins undergraduate has<br />\nbut one point of complaint\u2014there<br />\nis no recess after the strain of the<br />\nmidyears before the next semester<br />\nbegins. Undeniably, under the<br />\nold system, there was something<br />\npeculiarly satisfying in the idea<br />\nthat the period of examinations<br />\nwas to be followed by a period of<br />\nvery distinct relaxation; and,<br />\nequally undeniably, the return to<br />\ncollege last Monday was an occasion by no means joyful. Nevertheless, the difference between<br />\nwriting examination papers and<br />\nattending classes is great enough<br />\nto make the second occupation<br />\nseem extremely light by comparison\u2014and there are always rosy<br />\ndreams of the future, in which an<br />\nunquenchable belief in the inherent benevolence of the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty plays a very prominent<br />\npart.<br />\n<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nAccording to an order received<br />\nfrom the State health commission,<br />\nall students now attending the<br />\nUniversity of West Virginia must<br />\nbe vaccinated before they will be<br />\nallowed to re-enter classes for the<br />\nsecond semester.\u2014Ex.<br />\n* *<br />\nThe University of Oklahoma<br />\nclaims to have the largest geology<br />\ndepartment in the world, with an<br />\nenrollment of 400.\u2014Ex.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe musical clubs,,' of the University of Michigan made a western trip during the Christmas vacation.

The Senior-Freshman game<br />\nwas rather uninteresting to the onlookers as the underclassmen had<br />\neverything their own way, the<br />\nSeniors not being able to score<br />\nexcept once by the foul goal<br />\nroute. The Freshmen scored at<br />\nwill and played a crude but a<br />\nwinning game.<br />\nThe Junior-Sophomore battle,<br />\nhowever, made up for' the thrills<br />\nthat the other game lacked. The<br />\nscore was comparatively large<br />\nbut close, and many baskets were<br />\ncaged from different angles. Professor Kistler declared after the<br />\nsetto that \"it was some game\u2014<br />\nthe best I have ever seen played<br />\nhere.\" Both teams played desperately, the Juniors because they<br />\nwanted to retain the league<br />\nleadership, and the Sophomores<br />\nThe principal differbecause they had four losses and<br />\nence between Murad and<br />\nno wins to their credit.

When<br />\nthat time comes, if it is to come,<br />\nthe men of Our colleges will answer the appeal as enthusiastically as the men. of the European<br />\nuniversities responded to the call<br />\nof their governments, as enthusia4ically as volunteered the generations of American students before them in the War of S.ecession and the War with Spain.<br />\nSo much must we all do; that<br />\nis the easiest. What is the hardest, the most fundamental thing<br />\nof all, is for us to make ready for<br />\nwar, with the knowledge always<br />\nbefore us that we want, not war,<br />\nbut peace. We are grasping the<br />\nsword, not to extend the lines of<br />\nour boundaries, but to make evi-<br /><br />\nA Successful Innovation.<br /><br />\nEntirely apart from the fact<br />\nthat the mere ending of examinations is apt to cast an optimistic tinge over all philosophic reflections for the next few weeks<br />\nfollowing, there seems to be little<br />\ndissent in the University from the<br />\nopinion that the semester system<br /><br />\nwhich those examinations introduced is a distinct improvement<br />\nover the old three-term pldn.<br />\nIn the first place, of course,<br />\nthere is the obvious advantage of<br />\nhaving two sets of examinations<br />\nduring the year instead of three.<br />\nTheoretically, the midyears, coming a month or so later than did<br />\nthe first-term examinations under<br />\nthe old system, should necessitate<br />\nmore studying; but, in practice,<br />\nthe work of preparation for any<br />\nexaminations is heavy enough in<br />\nitself to make the additional review necessitated hardly noticeable\u2014the real strain of the examination period comes in the nervous tension engendered by its approach.<br />\nMoreover, under the present semester plan, with the end of the<br />\nmidyears, the work of the first<br />\nhalf year is definitely over\u2014there<br />\nis no frantic cramming of forgotten details at the last moment<br />\nbefore the finals, no doubling of<br />\nthe time of preparation needed<br />\nfor the first examinations. The<br />\nUniversity, under the present system, can face .the second half of<br />\nthe collegiate year with the satisfying knowledge that it has come<br />\nto a new leaf in reality, without<br />\nthe ghosts of the letters of previous chapters still hanging about<br />\nthe. pages.<br />\nMore and more, during the past<br />\nfew years, the undergraduate<br />\ncourses have been dividing themselves naturally, into parts\u2014philosophy, political economy II and<br />\nIII, several of the sciences \u2014 in<br />\nthese and many more there is a<br />\ndistinct break in the subject matter studied, which makes the division of the year into two parts<br />\ninstead of three far more satisfactory. In most of the large colleges, indeed, each undergraduate<br />\ncoutse is given for only a half<br />\nyear, the entire schedule of each<br />\nman being changed after midyears. The present Hopkins system is a very sane compromise\u2014<br />\ncourses comprehensive enough to<br />\nlast through the year, yet tending<br />\nnaturally to fall into two subdivisions.<br />\nThe Hopkins undergraduate has<br />\nbut one point of complaint\u2014there<br />\nis no recess after the strain of the<br />\nmidyears before the next semester<br />\nbegins. Undeniably, under the<br />\nold system, there was something<br />\npeculiarly satisfying in the idea<br />\nthat the period of examinations<br />\nwas to be followed by a period of<br />\nvery distinct relaxation; and,<br />\nequally undeniably, the return to<br />\ncollege last Monday was an occasion by no means joyful. Nevertheless, the difference between<br />\nwriting examination papers and<br />\nattending classes is great enough<br />\nto make the second occupation<br />\nseem extremely light by comparison\u2014and there are always rosy<br />\ndreams of the future, in which an<br />\nunquenchable belief in the inherent benevolence of the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty plays a very prominent<br />\npart.<br /><br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nAccording to an order received<br />\nfrom the State health commission,<br />\nall students now attending the<br />\nUniversity of West Virginia must<br />\nbe vaccinated before they will be<br />\nallowed to re-enter classes for the<br />\nsecond semester.\u2014Ex.<br />\n* *<br />\nThe University of Oklahoma<br />\nclaims to have the largest geology<br />\ndepartment in the world, with an<br />\nenrollment of 400.\u2014Ex.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe musical clubs,,' of the University of Michigan made a western trip during the Christmas vacation.
