Country Club Apartments: Over 40 acres of rolling, golf<br />\ncourse can be developed for residential use.

The hilltop at the northern end<br />\nof the site offers views and lookout development possibilities<br />\nthat should not be lost to the public.<br />\n<br />\n31. Parkway and Potential Development: Northern Parkway,<br />\nfrom Falls Road to Greenspring Avenue, should have parkway<br />\ntreatment on both sides in order that it might serve as an<br />\nentry to the Valley. The slopes are steep on the north side<br />\nfrom Rogers Avenue to Greenspring Avenue, and the stream<br />\nin that area needs protection.<br />\n<br />\n32. Private Recreation: The Valley floor reaches out to Falls<br />\nRoad in this stretch. The area should be scheduled for ac-<br />\nquisition as the owners wish to sell. The future use might be<br />\nadditional privately-operated recreational facilities similar to<br />\nthose to the north.<br />\n<br />\n33. Stream Conservation: The ravine and creek flowing into the<br />\nValley proper from the west is again an integral part of the<br />\nValley. The terrain is too rough for easy development and<br />\nmuch too beautiful not to be preserved.<br />\n<br />\n34. Meadowbrook: The Mt. Washington Lacrosse Club and the<br />\nMeadowbrook swimming pool and skating rink are highly<br />\ndesirable recreational uses; however, the City should work out<br />\nadequate means of assuring future land use control of this<br />\npart of the Valley. In the long run, similar recreational<br />\nfacilities might be developed north of the Kelly Avenue via-<br />\nduct.

Western Run Park: The junction of Western Run and Jones<br />\nFalls extends back along the Run to the Kelly and Sulgrave<br />\nAvenue intersection. This well-travelled intersection is an<br />\nimportant visual focal point for the Park. Retention of the<br />\ncharming library building on Smith Avenue and the landscape<br />\ndevelopment of the remainder will make a meaningful junc-<br />\nture of the Jones Falls Valley and Western Run. Along the<br />\nRun itself, the City should quickly acquire the remaining por-<br />\ntions indicated in Olmsted\u2019s Plan.<br />\n<br />\n36. Rapid Transit: The Northern Central Railway Line makes a<br />\nnatural route for a rapid transit commuter line. This should<br />\nbe studied at an early date by the newly instituted Metropoli-<br />\ntan Transit Authority. With rapid transit, the intensive<br />\ndevelopment along the Valley edges makes sense; and vice<br />\nversa.<br />\n<br />\n37. Scenic Road: After underpassing the Kelly Avenue viaduct,<br />\nthe Scenic Road will cling to the lower slopes below Mount<br />\nSt. Agnes College out to the City Line. A few evergreens in<br />\namong the beautiful existing planting on this campus will put<br />\nthe Road completely out of view from the College.<br />\n<br />\n38. Lake Roland Connection: The stream valley, from the City<br />\nLine to Lake Roland, is relatively undeveloped, is almost en-<br />\ntirely in the flood plain, and is a vital link in the Valley Plan.<br />\nThe 450-acre Robert E. Lee Park, known as Lake Roland,<br />\nis now owned by the City. It will become a natural destina-<br />\ntion for City hikers or riders making use of the Valley.<br />\n<br />\nAREAS NORTH AND SOUTH OF DETAILED STUDY SECTIONS<br />\n<br />\n39. County Extension: The Scenic Road should be extended into<br />\nthe County, up the draw north of Mount St. Agnes, where the<br />\nsize and beauty of the beech trees is breath-taking. The road<br />\ncould have a connection with Smith Avenue. Winding on<br />\nthrough open country, it can join Old Pimlico Road where<br />\nthat route will underpass the new expressway. Where Old<br />\nPimlico meets Falls Road, a new access into Lake Roland<br />\nwould be made, thus opening that rugged and beautiful park<br />\nto the public.<br />\n<br />\n40. Scenic Road: From the new junction of Old Pimlico and<br />\nFalls Roads, the Scenic Road takes advantage of the existing<br />\nroute of Falls Road, which needs only to have protection ex-<br />\ntended along its already beautiful borders.
