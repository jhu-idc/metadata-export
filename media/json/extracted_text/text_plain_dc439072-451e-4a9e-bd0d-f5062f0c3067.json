No pre-historic papa was<br />\nleft in peace until he had procured<br />\na string of pearls for his daughter.<br />\nSuch at least may be inferred from<br />\nthe mound builders' exhibit in the<br />\nOhio State Archaelogical and Historical Museum.<br />\n<br />\nfeel, should be lengthened to a full<br />\n<br />\nexamination period, we<br />\nT HE<br />\ntwo weeks and more time be allowed the student between each<br />\n<br />\nexam.<br />\nThe evils of the present system are two: first, many men are required<br />\nto take five, or even six, examinations on successive days; second,<br />\nstudents are often required to take two tests on the same day. When<br />\na man takes his exams on successive days, he has not enough time to<br />\nstudy for each one and, consequently, all must suffer. There is a facile,<br />\nbut hardly valid, objection to this statement. It is that students should<br />\nprepare for the quizzes during the weeks preceding January 27, but in<br />\nthe case of the average student much reviewing must be done immediately before the examination, in order that the details of the course<br />\nmay be retained in the memory during the fateful three hours. Everyone who has written a good examination paper only to forget many of<br />\nthe answers within a short time after his mark has been posted, will<br />\nappreciate the necessity of a concentrated review a few hours before his<br />\nfate is to be determined. Furthermore, five examinations in five days is<br />\na severe nervous strain, so that a man is quite apt to do very poorly on<br />\nthe fifth day. We do not consider the physical strain involved since it<br />\nis a function of the first point, namely that not enough time is allowed<br />\nfor review. The two vary inversely; if enough immediate review is<br />\ntaken, the requisite rest and brain alertness suffer, if enough rest is<br />\ntaken, the review suffers. But the nervous strain remains as no inconsequential difficulty. If one lifts his arm above his head, no strain is<br />\nfelt; if it is done one hundred times without cease a terrific fatigue is<br />\nexperienced; but if it is done twenty-five times, then a rest, then twentyfive more and so on until the hundred is completed, there is little strain<br />\ninvolved. So it is with exams; one is fine, but five in a row constitute<br />\na temporary menace to the nerves. However, if a period of rest be given<br />\nbetween the quizzes, all would be comparatively smooth sailing. We do<br />\nnot claim that exams constitute a menace to one's nervous system permanently, but we do state that the effect on the fifth day is noticeable,<br />\neven though recovery is very swift.<br />\nTwo examinations on one day repeat all the evils of the five-in-fivedays case. Several years ago one of the professors in the undergraduate<br />\nschool had made arrangements to leave the city before the date<br />\nscheduled for his examination. Consequently, the test was given on an<br />\nafternoon just two hours after the majority of the class had completed<br />\nanother exam. It was on a particularly warm June day and we are the<br />\nauthority for the statement that the studying for that examination consisted of utilizing every available shower in the Alumni Memorial Hall!<br />\nWe now have eight days for examinations. Under the proposed<br />\nsystem there would be twelve. If the exams were spread over the entire<br />\ntwelve-day period an advantage would be gained but there would still<br />\nbe some unfortunates who, by the luck of the draw, would be forced to<br />\ntake their tests in a hunch. We believe the better plan would be to designate four days on which no exams would be scheduled. The days for<br />\nworking would then be:<br />\nFirst week\u2014Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday<br />\nSecond week\u2014Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.<br />\nUnder this plan everyone would have at least one free day between<br />\nhis exams and two days of holiday would intervene before the opening<br />\nof classes for the next term.<br />\nWhat would be best under this plan? In mid-years, classes that fall on<br />\nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday would miss a full week's lecture, it is<br />\ntrue. Classes that come the first three days of the week would be deprived of one period only. Saturday classes are too few to be of any<br />\ngreat consequence. In the finals in June, absolutely no time would be<br />\nlost, as college would be in session three days longer. Surely the loss<br />\nof time in mid-years is hardly commensurate with the gain in fairness.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER regrets to announce that Richard Hunt has<br />\nrequested to be removed from the office of Assistant Managing Editor<br />\nand is now a Junior Editor.<br />\n<br />\nAt<br />\n<br />\nBirely's Pharmacy<br />\n<br />\nOne of Holland's outstanding<br />\nscientists, Dr. A.

These are no<br />\nlonger the dry, lifeless considerations of industry which were formerly dished out to students in textbooks of economics.<br />\n\"Once upon a time,\" Mr. Ludwig reminded us, \"economics was<br />\ndreaded by students as 'the dismal<br />\nscience.' But this is no longer true.<br />\nToday we have learned to combine<br />\nthe study of statistical charts with<br />\nreal, live experiences\u2014and textbooks in economics even have pictures in them now.\" Thus, for instance, some colleges send their<br />\nstudents of economics out into the<br />\nindustrial world to work for large<br />\nconcerns, where they will have firsthand information as to how industrial plants are run and where they<br />\nwill also become personally acquainted with the workers in industry, with their mode of working<br />\nand living and with their outlook<br />\nupon life.<br />\nOne of the chief handicaps with<br />\nwhich the student is confronted in<br />\nindustry is his lack of skill. To be<br />\nsure, the unskilled positions are<br />\nopen to him, but as an unskilled laborer he is excluded from the trade<br />\nunions and, Mr. Ludwig believes,<br />\nan acquaintance with the unions<br />\nshould prove a valuable experience<br />\nfor a student. But even if the student can acquire the skill necessary<br />\nto handle more complicated machinery, there are so many skilled workers out of jobs, that the chances of<br />\nthe student grow increasingly<br />\nsmaller.<br />\nAnother thing that is keeping the<br />\nstudent out of industry is his home<br />\nenvironment. Middle-class students<br />\nfrequently prefer middle-class jobs,<br />\nif they are obtainable. But even<br />\nstudents who come from proletarian homes at times drift into middle-class jobs, for their motive for<br />\ngoing to college is often none other<br />\nthan that of escaping from their<br />\n1881moof<br />\nown class.<br />\nThey should, however, be warned<br />\nthat this chance for an escape is<br />\nbecoming decreasingly possible.

No pre-historic papa was<br />\nleft in peace until he had procured<br />\na string of pearls for his daughter.<br />\nSuch at least may be inferred from<br />\nthe mound builders' exhibit in the<br />\nOhio State Archaelogical and Historical Museum.<br /><br />\nfeel, should be lengthened to a full<br /><br />\nexamination period, we<br />\nT HE<br />\ntwo weeks and more time be allowed the student between each<br /><br />\nexam.<br />\nThe evils of the present system are two: first, many men are required<br />\nto take five, or even six, examinations on successive days; second,<br />\nstudents are often required to take two tests on the same day. When<br />\na man takes his exams on successive days, he has not enough time to<br />\nstudy for each one and, consequently, all must suffer. There is a facile,<br />\nbut hardly valid, objection to this statement. It is that students should<br />\nprepare for the quizzes during the weeks preceding January 27, but in<br />\nthe case of the average student much reviewing must be done immediately before the examination, in order that the details of the course<br />\nmay be retained in the memory during the fateful three hours. Everyone who has written a good examination paper only to forget many of<br />\nthe answers within a short time after his mark has been posted, will<br />\nappreciate the necessity of a concentrated review a few hours before his<br />\nfate is to be determined. Furthermore, five examinations in five days is<br />\na severe nervous strain, so that a man is quite apt to do very poorly on<br />\nthe fifth day. We do not consider the physical strain involved since it<br />\nis a function of the first point, namely that not enough time is allowed<br />\nfor review. The two vary inversely; if enough immediate review is<br />\ntaken, the requisite rest and brain alertness suffer, if enough rest is<br />\ntaken, the review suffers. But the nervous strain remains as no inconsequential difficulty. If one lifts his arm above his head, no strain is<br />\nfelt; if it is done one hundred times without cease a terrific fatigue is<br />\nexperienced; but if it is done twenty-five times, then a rest, then twentyfive more and so on until the hundred is completed, there is little strain<br />\ninvolved. So it is with exams; one is fine, but five in a row constitute<br />\na temporary menace to the nerves. However, if a period of rest be given<br />\nbetween the quizzes, all would be comparatively smooth sailing. We do<br />\nnot claim that exams constitute a menace to one's nervous system permanently, but we do state that the effect on the fifth day is noticeable,<br />\neven though recovery is very swift.<br />\nTwo examinations on one day repeat all the evils of the five-in-fivedays case. Several years ago one of the professors in the undergraduate<br />\nschool had made arrangements to leave the city before the date<br />\nscheduled for his examination. Consequently, the test was given on an<br />\nafternoon just two hours after the majority of the class had completed<br />\nanother exam. It was on a particularly warm June day and we are the<br />\nauthority for the statement that the studying for that examination consisted of utilizing every available shower in the Alumni Memorial Hall!<br />\nWe now have eight days for examinations. Under the proposed<br />\nsystem there would be twelve. If the exams were spread over the entire<br />\ntwelve-day period an advantage would be gained but there would still<br />\nbe some unfortunates who, by the luck of the draw, would be forced to<br />\ntake their tests in a hunch. We believe the better plan would be to designate four days on which no exams would be scheduled. The days for<br />\nworking would then be:<br />\nFirst week\u2014Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday<br />\nSecond week\u2014Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.<br />\nUnder this plan everyone would have at least one free day between<br />\nhis exams and two days of holiday would intervene before the opening<br />\nof classes for the next term.<br />\nWhat would be best under this plan? In mid-years, classes that fall on<br />\nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday would miss a full week's lecture, it is<br />\ntrue. Classes that come the first three days of the week would be deprived of one period only. Saturday classes are too few to be of any<br />\ngreat consequence. In the finals in June, absolutely no time would be<br />\nlost, as college would be in session three days longer. Surely the loss<br />\nof time in mid-years is hardly commensurate with the gain in fairness.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER regrets to announce that Richard Hunt has<br />\nrequested to be removed from the office of Assistant Managing Editor<br />\nand is now a Junior Editor.<br /><br />\nAt<br /><br />\nBirely's Pharmacy<br /><br />\nOne of Holland's outstanding<br />\nscientists, Dr. A.

Not<br />\nonly does he earn money\u2014which in<br />\nsome instance, to be sure, may be<br />\nvery helpful\u2014and does he become<br />\nacquainted with the devious<br />\nmechanisms by which jobs are distributed, but he also meets face to<br />\nface with a new aspect of life, the<br />\nindustrial aspect. These are no<br />\nlonger the dry, lifeless considerations of industry which were formerly dished out to students in textbooks of economics.<br />\n\"Once upon a time,\" Mr. Ludwig reminded us, \"economics was<br />\ndreaded by students as 'the dismal<br />\nscience.' But this is no longer true.<br />\nToday we have learned to combine<br />\nthe study of statistical charts with<br />\nreal, live experiences\u2014and textbooks in economics even have pictures in them now.\" Thus, for instance, some colleges send their<br />\nstudents of economics out into the<br />\nindustrial world to work for large<br />\nconcerns, where they will have firsthand information as to how industrial plants are run and where they<br />\nwill also become personally acquainted with the workers in industry, with their mode of working<br />\nand living and with their outlook<br />\nupon life.<br />\nOne of the chief handicaps with<br />\nwhich the student is confronted in<br />\nindustry is his lack of skill. To be<br />\nsure, the unskilled positions are<br />\nopen to him, but as an unskilled laborer he is excluded from the trade<br />\nunions and, Mr. Ludwig believes,<br />\nan acquaintance with the unions<br />\nshould prove a valuable experience<br />\nfor a student. But even if the student can acquire the skill necessary<br />\nto handle more complicated machinery, there are so many skilled workers out of jobs, that the chances of<br />\nthe student grow increasingly<br />\nsmaller.<br />\nAnother thing that is keeping the<br />\nstudent out of industry is his home<br />\nenvironment. Middle-class students<br />\nfrequently prefer middle-class jobs,<br />\nif they are obtainable. But even<br />\nstudents who come from proletarian homes at times drift into middle-class jobs, for their motive for<br />\ngoing to college is often none other<br />\nthan that of escaping from their<br />\n1881moof<br />\nown class.<br />\nThey should, however, be warned<br />\nthat this chance for an escape is<br />\nbecoming decreasingly possible.
