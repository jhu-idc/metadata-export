MITCHELL DRAWS CROWD<br />\nMcCoy Hall Packed to Hear Distinguished Neurologist and Author Lecture on \"William Harvey.\"<br />\n<br />\nThat the Baltimore public is not<br />\naltogether indifferent to the lectures offered by the University, and<br />\nthat the size of attendance depends<br />\nlargely upon the extent of the<br />\nlecturer's popularity, was demonstrated last Monday night by the<br />\nunusually large and brilliant assembly which thronged McCoy<br />\nHall to hear one of the most illustrious men whom the University<br />\nhas recently had the honor to entertain. The venerable Dr. Silas<br />\nWeir Mitchell, now in his eightysecond year, poet, novelist, antiquarian, physician, and in all these<br />\ncapacities distinguished, delivered,<br />\nat the invitation of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Historical Association, a lecture on \"William Harvey,\" his spiritual ancestor, as he<br />\nfondly called him, and practically<br />\nthe founder of the modern science<br />\nof medicine.<br />\nDr. Mitchell is no narrow specialist, but a man of the broadest human interests ; and he treated his<br />\nsubject, consequently, not as a<br />\nscientific abstraction, but as a living hero. He told of William<br />\nHarvey's boyhood in the little fishing town of Folkestone, on the<br />\nKentish coast, of his sojourn as a<br />\nlesser pensioner at Cains College,<br />\nCambridge; of his anatomical studies under Fabricius, at Aquapendente, at the great Italian University of Padua; of his graduation<br />\nfrom that venerable seat of learning with all the stately and impressive pomp so dear to Italian<br />\ntradition\u2014the darkened theatre, the<br />\nrobed senators of Venice; the opening of the closed books, the kiss<br />\nof peace, the goblet crown, the ring<br />\nof marriage to the University, the<br />\npresentation of the folded diploma.<br />\nDr. Mitchell is a most charming<br />\nlecturer. He is not an orator; he<br />\nis a speaker of the old school; he<br />\ndoes not scruple to use a ringing<br />\nphrase or a flowery sentence when<br />\nhe thinks such would be effective;<br />\nhis delivery is hardly such as would<br />\npass in public speaking. Yet it<br />\nis a pleasure to listen to him. His<br />\nvenerable figure, his winning personality, his graceful humor, his<br />\ndepth of thought, his breadth of<br />\ninterest, his richness of allusion,<br />\nhis great store of general knowledge, his youthful enthusiasm, combine to make him one of, the most<br />\nentertaining lecturers whom Hopkins has had the pleasure to hear<br />\nfor a long time.

The discussion of the fundamental principles is very brief, but<br />\nto the point, and by far the greater<br />\npart of the book is given up to<br />\nmasterpieces of complete debates<br />\non important questions which have<br />\nagitated the country. All of the<br />\ngreat figures in the Senate are represented in the collection, and<br />\nthis, in addition to furnishing illustrations of the principles discussed<br />\nin the early part of the book has<br />\nthe added advantage of giving to<br />\nthe general reader these great debates in a collected form. The<br />\nmanner of saying things in defense<br />\nof great principles is secondary to<br />\nwhat has been said, and it is just<br />\nas important to know what the<br />\ncontentions of Lincoln and Webster were, as the manner in which<br />\ntheir arguments were presented.<br />\nThis volume makes both possible.<br />\nIn addition there is much new<br />\nmaterial in the book on the subject<br />\n-of briefing and debating.

MITCHELL DRAWS CROWD<br />\nMcCoy Hall Packed to Hear Distinguished Neurologist and Author Lecture on \"William Harvey.\"<br /><br />\nThat the Baltimore public is not<br />\naltogether indifferent to the lectures offered by the University, and<br />\nthat the size of attendance depends<br />\nlargely upon the extent of the<br />\nlecturer's popularity, was demonstrated last Monday night by the<br />\nunusually large and brilliant assembly which thronged McCoy<br />\nHall to hear one of the most illustrious men whom the University<br />\nhas recently had the honor to entertain. The venerable Dr. Silas<br />\nWeir Mitchell, now in his eightysecond year, poet, novelist, antiquarian, physician, and in all these<br />\ncapacities distinguished, delivered,<br />\nat the invitation of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Historical Association, a lecture on \"William Harvey,\" his spiritual ancestor, as he<br />\nfondly called him, and practically<br />\nthe founder of the modern science<br />\nof medicine.<br />\nDr. Mitchell is no narrow specialist, but a man of the broadest human interests ; and he treated his<br />\nsubject, consequently, not as a<br />\nscientific abstraction, but as a living hero. He told of William<br />\nHarvey's boyhood in the little fishing town of Folkestone, on the<br />\nKentish coast, of his sojourn as a<br />\nlesser pensioner at Cains College,<br />\nCambridge; of his anatomical studies under Fabricius, at Aquapendente, at the great Italian University of Padua; of his graduation<br />\nfrom that venerable seat of learning with all the stately and impressive pomp so dear to Italian<br />\ntradition\u2014the darkened theatre, the<br />\nrobed senators of Venice; the opening of the closed books, the kiss<br />\nof peace, the goblet crown, the ring<br />\nof marriage to the University, the<br />\npresentation of the folded diploma.<br />\nDr. Mitchell is a most charming<br />\nlecturer. He is not an orator; he<br />\nis a speaker of the old school; he<br />\ndoes not scruple to use a ringing<br />\nphrase or a flowery sentence when<br />\nhe thinks such would be effective;<br />\nhis delivery is hardly such as would<br />\npass in public speaking. Yet it<br />\nis a pleasure to listen to him. His<br />\nvenerable figure, his winning personality, his graceful humor, his<br />\ndepth of thought, his breadth of<br />\ninterest, his richness of allusion,<br />\nhis great store of general knowledge, his youthful enthusiasm, combine to make him one of, the most<br />\nentertaining lecturers whom Hopkins has had the pleasure to hear<br />\nfor a long time.
