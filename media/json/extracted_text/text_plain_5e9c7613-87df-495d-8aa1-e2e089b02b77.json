But we<br />\nprefer, if we're going to get our<br />\nhair cut at a moderate price, to<br />\nchannel our money into a small<br />\nbusiness, closely held and without a<br />\nlot of overhead for fancy \"atmosphere,\" advertising, and corporate superstructure. So we go to<br />\nHair Unlimited. This tiny studio,4<br />\ntucked away in the basement of a<br />\nwhite-stucco apartment building,<br />\ncertainly has low overhead, but<br />\nyour hair looks great once you<br />\nclimb back to street level.

The<br />\nonly formal definition available in<br />\nprior years was that the awards<br />\nwere to be given to no more than<br />\nfive percent of the graduating<br />\nclass in recognition of their involvement in extracurricular<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThis definition has now been<br />\naccomplished, according to a<br />\npreliminary outline of the committee's work: \"The Student Activities Award shall be given as<br />\nrecognition for meritorious and<br />\noutstanding contributions to student activities during the recipient's undergradute years at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.\"<br />\nA list of \"criteria for selecting<br />\nrecipients\" follows. These<br />\ncriteria include requirements of<br />\ninvolvement for three to four<br />\nyears, leadership positions in student organizations, membership<br />\nin more than one organization,<br />\n<br />\nand which activities shotild be<br />\ncounted. Non-SAC activities such<br />\nas fraternities are considered but<br />\npaid positions and athletics do<br />\nnot. Pan said that although the<br />\ncriteria are only guidelines rather<br />\nthan aboslute requirements, once<br />\ndefined they will be very firm.<br />\nPan and fellow committee<br />\nmember Sa Surmeli favored retaining the five percent limit on<br />\nthe number of awards given,<br />\nwhile Student Council President<br />\nMark Komisky and several others<br />\npresnt argued that the limit makes<br />\nthe awards overly competitive,<br />\namong other considerations.<br />\nKomisky also mentioned that<br />\nthe combination of the requirements for membership in<br />\nmore than one organization and<br />\nfor having held a leadership position \"will cut off a lot already.\"<br />\nPan said that since the new<br />\nguidelines are similar to those actually, informally used by the<br />\ncommittee last year, this effect<br />\nshould not be as pronounced as it<br />\nmight seem.<br />\nBrad Marks, senior class<br />\nrepresentative to the Student<br />\nCouncil, asked, \"Whoever<br />\ndeserves it, why not give them<br />\none?\" Surmeli described the purpose of the limit: \"What we're<br />\nsaying, five percent, is arbitrary,<br />\nbut 'outstanding' means 'above<br />\nthe crowd' and you have to decide<br />\nwho is the crowd.\"<br />\nPan emphasized that the five<br />\npercent limit is the upper figure<br />\nand said that he would prefer to<br />\nhave a three percent mean<br />\nbecause the number of deserving<br />\nstudents varies with the class in<br />\nquestion.<br />\n<br />\nThe process of the award selections was also discussed. No<br />\ndefinite decision has been reached, but Pan suggested that letters<br />\ndescribing the awards and the<br />\nprocess be sent out to all seniors<br />\nand juniors three weeks before<br />\nnominations for the awards are<br />\ndue.<br />\nPoster and a News-Letter ad<br />\nwill also be used to increase student awarness of the procedure,<br />\nalthough it was noted by a<br />\nmember of the junior class that,<br />\n\"No one ever reads the NewsLetter.\" One argument against<br />\nthe award selections in previous<br />\nyears was that insufficient prior<br />\npublicity resulted in deserving<br />\nstudents not being nominated.<br />\nWhen nomination letters are<br />\nreceived by a nine-member committee consisting of the executive<br />\ncommittee of the Union Board<br />\nand two representatives from the<br />\nsenior class, the letters will be<br />\ndivided up among the members of<br />\nthe committee and scrutinized,<br />\naccording to Pan. Telephone interviews<br />\nof<br />\nnominees,<br />\n\"preferably by people who don't<br />\nknow [them],\" will be conducted<br />\nby the committee.<br />\nThe committee will then<br />\nprepare a list of candidates for the<br />\nawards, which must then be approved by the SAC and the Student Council. According to<br />\nMarks, Council's objections to<br />\nthe intitial list submitted by the<br />\ncommittee last year were on procedural grounds\u2014primarily insufficient publicity\u2014and not on<br />\nthe specific choice of names.<br />\n<br />\nFlow<br />\nGood<br />\nCan<br />\nYOU<br />\nLook?<br />\nFind<br />\nJk Out<br />\nCoordinator of Int'l Studies<br />\n<br />\nHair Unlim<br />\n<br />\nTo Leave After Semester's End<br />\nContinued from Page 1<br />\n<br />\ncil and the dean of the School of<br />\nEngineering, said, \"Everybody<br />\nMember International Hair Designers<br />\nbelieved Dr. David is a good<br />\n3120 St. Paul St. Monday-Saturday 10-6 235-0741.<br />\nteacher.

I was vice-president of the<br />\nfreshman class, this year I was<br />\npresident of the junior class, and<br />\nI served on the Buildings and<br />\nGrounds Committee and worked<br />\non the Social Committee,<br />\norganized a lot of social events.<br />\nOutside of the University, I've<br />\nbeen involved in some cultural<br />\norganizations and organizing<br />\nthem, so I do know how to get<br />\nthings organized, work with the<br />\nSAC and the administration.<br />\nI'm very motivated. I'm excited about the whole opportunity. I think that the Student Council's been going pretty well this<br />\nyear. They've covered a wide<br />\nrange of topics. The only fault I<br />\nfind with the whole process is that<br />\nsometimes you do a lot of work<br />\nand nothing comes of it, and<br />\nhopefully if we can help develop<br />\nsome kind of power of the Student Council, as the IFC is working towards that this year,<br />\nhopefully the Student Council<br />\nwill be able to have more direct<br />\ninput into the University.<br />\nN-L: Would that be your top<br />\npriority as President, or do you<br />\nhave another top priority?<br />\nSurmeli: I think that my major<br />\npriority would be to help the Student Council develop.

Obviously, if you know<br />\nsomeone, you have a better<br />\nchance of knowing if he's<br />\nqualified.<br />\nBut I think there is a problem<br />\nthat people don't know about the<br />\nfact that there is this committee<br />\nchair opening, someone's got to<br />\nchair this committee, that, that,<br />\nthat, all the standing committees,<br />\nad hoc committees on the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe problem comes down to if<br />\nthere are a couple of committees<br />\n<br />\nthat people want to chair, ana<br />\nthen there are a bunch that people don't, and you've got fine<br />\npeople to fill them all, and fill<br />\nthem well, I don't think there's<br />\nany problem in the system right<br />\nnow.<br />\nThere is one problem that<br />\nCouncil brought up once or<br />\ntwice, and it sort of faded out,<br />\nwith the COC.

The<br />\nfaculty, students, and staff who must<br />\ncommute to Homewood take inordinate<br />\nand unnecessary risks in making the<br />\ntrip. In a city like Baltimore with a small<br />\nsnow removal system, asking<br />\nemployees and students to travel during<br />\na snowstorm is asking for a disaster.<br />\nFurthermore, staying \"open\" during<br />\na storm becomes an adventure in the absurd since only a small number of faculty members actually arrive to teach.<br />\nWe believe that the most prudent<br />\ncourse of action is to close the University when large storms hit, even if the<br />\nschool year must be extended to account<br />\nfor the lost time. There is no reason to<br />\nendanger Hopkins' students and staff for<br />\nthe \"heroic\" distinction of being the on(which was the wimpiest of the three ly school in Maryland not to close<br />\nbecause of Nature's wrath.

We hope Monday's<br />\n<br />\nMonday was a strange day at<br />\nHomewood indeed. For the first time<br />\nwe can remember, Hopkins closed<br />\nbecause of the weather. We were<br />\ndelighted.<br />\nCertainly, the announcement of a sudden holiday from classes was cause for<br />\nhappiness for most students and faculty. But what pleased us especially was<br />\nnot the respite from work, but the<br />\nresponsibility the University showed by<br />\nthe closing.<br />\nIn the last month, three large storms<br />\nhave paralyzed the city, closing schools,<br />\nbusinesses, and state offices. Nevertheless, during the first two storms,<br />\nHopkins administrators chose to brave<br />\nthe weather while virtually every other<br />\nschool in the state, from kindergarten<br />\non up, shut down.<br />\nSo, the announcement of Monday's<br />\nclosing in response to the latest storm<br />\n<br />\nThe N-L Hoopla<br />\nThis was a difficult week for us at the<br />\nNews-Letter. In addition to the usual<br />\nmechanical failures, early morning<br />\nemergencies, and administrative worries, we were the target of a barrage of<br />\nletters to the editor, telephone calls, and<br />\nthreats. At the risk of committing that<br />\npotential journalistic sin known as a selfreferential editorial, we have decided to<br />\ncomment on the N-L hoopla.<br />\nLast week, as faithful readers of our<br />\npages will recall, we printed a letter to<br />\nthe editor by Joseph D. Terwilliger of<br />\nthe Peabody Institute. In the letter, Terwilliger argued that John Demjanjuk<br />\n(the former Cleveland auto worker on<br />\ntrial in Israel for his alleged crimes during the Holocaust) and other suspected<br />\nNazi war criminals should not be hunted<br />\nor prosecuted. Terwilliger also questioned \"the proof that there really was<br />\na Holocaust.\"<br />\nThis week, we received a stack of letters responding to Terwilliger's comments. (The letters can be found<br />\nelsewhere on these pages.) In addition,<br />\nwe have been told by many that the<br />\nNews-Letter's printing of Terwilliger's<br />\nletter was shocking and appalling. We<br />\nhave even received a number of<br />\nmessages from the more radial<br />\nelements of the Hopkins Community<br />\nthreatening that the News-Letter<br />\n<br />\nGatehouse may be burned down for<br />\nprinting the letter.<br />\nSuch threats and comments scare us,<br />\nnot because we are afraid someone will<br />\nactually torch the Gatehouse (although<br />\nthat tactic is being used with all too great<br />\na frequency here at Hopkins) but<br />\nbecause such comments show an alarming disrespect for the right to freedom<br />\nof expression.<br />\nWe are certainly in disagreement with<br />\nTerwilliger's interpretation of history.<br />\nNevertheless, we strongly defend Terwilliger's right to express his ideas here<br />\non these pages.<br />\nAfter all, we have an obligation to<br />\nprint ideas even when\u2014perhaps<br />\nespecially when\u2014 those ideas are in<br />\nmost direct conflict with our own.<br />\nThis week, we were happy to see Terwilliger's ideas debated thoroughly. For<br />\nthe most part, the letters we received<br />\nseem to treat Terwilliger's letter in a<br />\nresponsible and constructive (although<br />\nsomewhat repetitive) fashion.<br />\nWe hope that all members of the community will continue to use these pages<br />\nas a forum for responsible discussion of<br />\nissues of concern to the community. For<br />\nour part, we intend to do everything<br />\npossible to ensure that reasonable letters meeting our loose production<br />\nguidelines will be printed.<br />\n<br />\nIt has come to my attention that<br />\nDr. Steven David has been denied<br />\npromotion from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor by<br />\nthe Academic Council of the<br />\nUniversity. What makes this<br />\nnews particularly astonishing is<br />\nthat David had the unanimous<br />\nsupport of the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science in the question<br />\nof his promotion. The fact that<br />\n<br />\nheavy course load and administrative duties, may have<br />\nresulted in his denial of promotion is ironic and unfair.<br />\nI understand the premium that<br />\nis placed on scholarly writing by<br />\nthe University and, to a certain<br />\nextent, I agree with it; one of the<br />\nfunctions of a university is to advance scholarly research and<br />\nwriting in all fields of study. But<br />\n<br />\ndave meiselman<br />\nDavid will be forced to leave the<br />\nUniversity at the conclusion of<br />\nthis semester is a great shock to<br />\nthose in the International Studies<br />\nmajor and Political Science<br />\nDepartment, and a tragedy for<br />\nanyone who has taken a course<br />\nwith him.<br />\nDavid is widely regarded as<br />\none of the best professors on campus; I believe he is the best. He<br />\nis an excellent lecturer, and his<br />\nclasses and teaching are directly<br />\nresponsible for the International<br />\nStudies major becoming one of<br />\nthe largest undergraduate majors.<br />\nHis administration of the IR program and his advising of<br />\ncountless students have provided<br />\na stability and continuity to a major which is not a major in and of<br />\nitself. I can say from personal experience that his advice has been<br />\ninvaluable to me in decisions<br />\nregarding my academic pursuits<br />\nand ultimately my vocational<br />\nfuture.<br />\nTo take David away from the<br />\nDepartment would cause an<br />\nalready troubled major to digress<br />\ninto chaos. As stated above, he<br />\nhas been the only thing that has<br />\nlent stability and continuity to<br />\nthe program. The fact that his efforts to maintain the quality of the<br />\nIR program, including his very<br />\n<br />\nto place a premium on writing to<br />\nsuch an extent that it becomes allencompassing is to forget the<br />\nprimary function that a university should fulfill\u2014the teaching of<br />\nyoung minds. David has done<br />\nmore than any other to advance<br />\nmy education. To deprive future<br />\nHopkins students of his expertise<br />\nwould be a great disservice to<br />\nhim, to them, to those who have<br />\nbenefited from him, and to the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nI believe that given his extraordinary teaching ability and his<br />\ncontributions to his department<br />\nand students, the Council should<br />\ngive him the benefit of the doubt<br />\nthat in the coming years his<br />\nscholarly works will be on the<br />\nforefront of his field.

In denying the<br />\nHolocaust Mr. Terwilliger denies<br />\na fact. The Holocaust is not a<br />\nsymbol. It is a reality. The civilized can be barbarized. There are<br />\nno limits on evil. When<br />\nnewcomers to the camps were<br />\ncremated the fat on their bodies<br />\nmade the smoke black. People<br />\nwho had been slave laborers in<br />\nthe camps for a while produced<br />\na white smoke. Twelve million<br />\npeople were murdered by a<br />\nbureaucratic machine.

Terwilliger's proNazi letter is screaming for a<br />\nresponse. His main point, not<br />\nprosecuting 40-year-old Nazi<br />\ncrimes against World War II<br />\nJews, can be easily refuted. Our<br />\njudicial system is based on<br />\nreform, but we must not let people go unpunished for some of the<br />\nmost hideous crimes committed<br />\nin this century. If we were to let<br />\nthese Nazi offenders get away<br />\nwith their crimes, we are subtly<br />\nencouraging others to perpetrate<br />\nsuch atrocities and go into hiding<br />\nfor forty years of \"punishment\"<br />\n(according to Terwilliger). This<br />\nis not punishment considering<br />\nthese Nazis were rolling in dough<br />\nin their hide-outs in South<br />\nAmerica. May we ask what<br />\nschool of thought doubts the existence of the Holocaust? Could<br />\nit be the Neo-Nazis living in the<br />\nnorthwestern parts of America?

The author, Joseph<br />\nD. Terwilliger, referred to the<br />\n\"alleged Nazi Holocaust of the<br />\nJews,\" and the \"alleged crimes<br />\nof the Nazis.\" He went on to state<br />\nthat there are no facts that can<br />\nsuccessfully prove that a<br />\nHolocaust actually existed. What<br />\nwould Mr. Terwilliger suggest<br />\nhappened to the six million Jews<br />\nthat died during this period, including a large portion of my<br />\nfamily? Did they vanish into thin<br />\nair? How does Mr. Terwilliger account for Holocaust survivors,<br />\nwitnesses to the abhorrent<br />\ncrimes? Did they imagine this<br />\nhorror? In response to the opinion<br />\nthat we should leave these<br />\n\"helpless old men\" alone, I point<br />\nout that millions of people never<br />\nreached old age due to the actions<br />\nof these men.. It is a sad state we<br />\nare in when an educated young<br />\nperson, such as Mr. Terwilliger,<br />\nis willing to change history in an<br />\nattempt to justify his anti-Semitic<br />\nsentiment.<br />\n<br />\nTerwilliger III<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe letter that appeared in last<br />\n<br />\nThe comments of Mr. Terwilliger last week, have convinced me to write to your paper. It<br />\nsurprised me slightly, that he<br />\nbrought up his opinion that the<br />\nHolocaust might never have hap-<br />\n<br />\npened, but what surprised me<br />\neven more was the response I got<br />\nfrom my peers after discussing<br />\nthe letter with them.

There is a big<br />\nmovement in the United States<br />\n(led by a Jew, of all the irony!)<br />\nwhich supports the claim that<br />\nthere never was a Holocaust. This<br />\ngroup has even gone to such extremes as to go to court and accuse Holocaust survivors of<br />\nfraudery and deceit, claiming that<br />\nthe Holocaust was \"The Ultimate<br />\nLie!\"<br />\nSuch claims are an insult not<br />\nonly to Jews, (which comprise<br />\nnearly 30 percent of this campus),<br />\nbut also to Blacks, (which comprise an additional 10 percent),<br />\nand to homosexuals as well (an<br />\nadditional 10 percent) who also<br />\nsuffered greatly at the hands of<br />\nthe Nazis.<br />\nIf Hitler were alive today, he<br />\nwould probably laugh at the fact<br />\nthat he killed 6 million+ ,without<br />\nsome people even noticing.

Epstein<br />\n<br />\nTerwilliger VI<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAfter reading Mr. Terwilligei's letter in the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter, I felt obligated to<br />\nreply to the statements and innuendoes that abound. There is a<br />\ngreat temptation to analyze each<br />\nline to show the misconception<br />\nand faulty logic used in the letter.<br />\nFor the sake of brevity, I will only comment on five points.<br />\n1. The statement that only<br />\n150,000 Jews perished during the<br />\nSecond World War can easily be<br />\ndisproved. One method would be<br />\nto interview the Jews living in this<br />\narea and Mr. Terwilliger will find<br />\nthat the number of relatives and<br />\nacquaintances lost by these Jews<br />\nfar exceeds 150,000. I will be<br />\nglad to meet with Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nto discuss other ways to determine the enormity of the<br />\nHolocaust.<br />\n2. The statement that seems to<br />\nsay that if some criminals are not<br />\nbrought to justice (for whatever<br />\nreason) none should be punished<br />\nis ludicrous.<br />\n3. I cannot understand the logic<br />\nwhich compares the bombing of<br />\ncities in a war situation to the<br />\nsystematic elimination of people<br />\non the basis of race or creed. To<br />\nequate both situations elevated the<br />\nHolocaust to war crimes, while in<br />\nreality, it was an act devoid of all<br />\nhuman feelings.

So we<br />\ndon't doubt that Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nquoted the figure of only 150,000<br />\nJews correctly.

Furthermore, we<br />\ndo not agree that hiding is<br />\n\"punishment enough.\" There is<br />\nno statute of limitations in this<br />\ncountry, and neither should there<br />\nbe.

In<br />\nmy experience, thus far, I have<br />\nnot yet encountered a suitable<br />\npunishment to serve as retribution<br />\nfor the crimes of Nazi-Germany.<br />\nNazi trials are conducted to<br />\nguarantee that our future mistakes<br />\ncome about despite our attempts<br />\nto correct, not as a result of an<br />\nimpetuous search for ignorance<br />\n(represented in many forms, one<br />\nof which is an artificial state of<br />\namnesia).<br />\nMost among us contend that it<br />\nis acceptable for a law enforcement vehicle to exceed the speed<br />\nlimit in order to pursue a speeding<br />\nautomobile.

Yet, few<br />\namong us would approve of the<br />\nattempts to exterminate a nation<br />\nas an indirect outcome of the<br />\ndivine battle against communism.<br />\nYou, Mr. Terwilliger, belong to<br />\nthe latter group. Though I am inclined to agree with you that today's Nazis may very well be<br />\nharmless, the group which you<br />\nrepresent is not!<br />\nWith a prophetic tone, and a<br />\nnewly found self-identity, Mr.<br />\nTerwilliger proceeds: \"Let us<br />\nstop living with the horrors of the<br />\npast. We must all join together,<br />\nwhites, blacks, orientals, and<br />\nJewish persons, to fight against<br />\nthe true enemy of freedom, cornmunish.\" Mr. Terwilliger, in this<br />\nmoving statement, I had found a<br />\ncharisma unmatched by any but<br />\nthe electrifying speeches of Adolf<br />\nHitler.

First, Mr. Terwilliger claims that \"any Nazis<br />\nwho may yet be alive are in fact<br />\nharmless.\" The current danger<br />\nthat these 'former' criminals pose<br />\nis not a factor. Demanjuk and<br />\nothers must be punished for the<br />\ncrimes that they committed, with<br />\nno regard to the passage of time.<br />\nAdditionally, for Mr. Terwilliger's information, Neo-Nazi<br />\ngroups are alive and well in the<br />\nUnited States. Groups such as<br />\nThe Order and The League of<br />\nAryan Nations not only spread<br />\ntheir rascist propaganda, but have<br />\nattempted to act as well. A huge<br />\ncache of arms was recently confiscated from The Order. The<br />\nLeague of Aryan Nations held a<br />\nconference this summer in Cour<br />\nD'Alene, Idaho to attempt to turn<br />\nthe northwest states into an Aryan<br />\nnation. When a local church<br />\nleader spoke out against them, his<br />\nhouse was firebombed. Although<br />\n43 years have passed, these<br />\n'former' criminals and all that<br />\nthey stand for still pose a threat<br />\nto mankind.<br />\nMr. Terwilliger does not stop<br />\nhere, however. He goes on to<br />\nclaim that the Holocaust never occurred. If, as Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nsays, \"150,000 Jews died of all<br />\ncauses between 1939 and 1944,\"<br />\nhow does he explain the utterly<br />\ngruesome pictures of piles of<br />\nteeth, hair and personal belongings publicly printed.

They<br />\nat least realized the worst threat<br />\nto human freedom in history,<br />\nsocialism, and the arch-evil, communism.\" It is ironic that Mr.<br />\nTerwilliger's letter recognizes a<br />\nhumanitarian value in the actions<br />\nof Nazi-Germany for having<br />\nthreatened communism. As to<br />\ndetails such as the alleged attempt<br />\nof Nazi-Germany to wipe out the<br />\nJewish nation, Mr. Terwilliger<br />\npromptly points out: \". . . until<br />\nthe acts introduced by the<br />\nHolocaust revisionists can be successfully countered, there can be<br />\nno proof that there really was a<br />\nHolocaust.\" Yet, Mr. Terwilliger is aware that history cannot be revised, it is simply<br />\nrecorded for us to contemplate.<br />\nEven more astonishing is Mr.<br />\nTerwilliger's lack of understanding regarding the purpose of the<br />\nNazi trials: \"The alleged crimes<br />\nof the Nazis occurred 40 years<br />\nago, so give it a rest.

Like the talk,<br />\nit is different only in its proportion. On the first Christmas<br />\nepisode, with Mary and the baby<br />\nand the three kings, the show ended with the plot resolved by a<br />\nfight with stuffed toys. The<br />\ncharacters stepped out and wished everybody in audience-land<br />\nhappy holidays. In the season<br />\nfinale, after a ludicrous chase<br />\nscene, the guest stars, Whoopi<br />\nGoldberg and Judd Nelson, were<br />\ncalled away to their limos and the<br />\nplot came to a halt. The<br />\ncharacters left for the summer,<br />\ntantalizing<br />\npromising<br />\ndevelopments. On this out-ofcontrol scale, the gimmick makes<br />\ngood on its promise. However<br />\nannoying it may be, the<br />\nmechanical details of the episode<br />\nplot are sacrificed to the ongoing<br />\n<br />\ncomedy and romance of the series<br />\nplot (or, everything is sacrificed<br />\nto the ratings).<br />\nImpossible to overlook in this<br />\nawareness business is the fact that<br />\nDavid and Maddie, even when<br />\nthey give you a hint they know<br />\nthey are on camera, remain David<br />\nand Maddie.

Carey<br />\nThomas, was repeatedly denied<br />\naccess to education at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. As a result<br />\nof her determined efforts to enter<br />\nthe University, Thomas was<br />\neventually permitted to sit in the<br />\nrear of the lecture, screened from<br />\nview of the male students. The<br />\nM. Carey Thomas Feminist<br />\nAlliance is so named in respect<br />\nfor her efforts.<br />\nThe Alliance, composed of approximately fifteen active female<br />\nand male members, is attempting<br />\nto promote equality and further<br />\ntolerance of the issues of women.<br />\nThe Alliance is not nationally affiliated. Its definition of<br />\n\"feminism\" is therefore determined by individual members,<br />\n<br />\nand is not associated with common stereotypical perceptions of<br />\nthe word \"feminism\". In<br />\npopular<br />\na<br />\ncountering<br />\nremonstrance, the Alliance is not<br />\na band of hysterical androgynous<br />\n<br />\nfrom a patriarchal to a matriarchal structure: rather, the<br />\nAlliance is working to challenge<br />\nsocial misconceptions of the role<br />\nof women in society, to create<br />\nsolidarity and self-perception<br />\n<br />\nwomen.<br />\nOn campus the Alliance has<br />\nself-defense<br />\norganized<br />\nworkshops, and provided<br />\nseminars on birth control,<br />\nfeminization of poverty, job op-<br />\n<br />\nELEL3i<br />\niL<br />\n<br />\nELIADE<br />\nwomen running about in search of<br />\na cause. The Alliance perceives<br />\nsociety as non-meritocratic and<br />\npatriarchal. Its goal is not, as<br />\nmany believe, to simply switch<br />\nthe unequal balance of perception<br />\n<br />\namong women, to secure the betterment of the lifestyles of<br />\nwomen, and to strive for equality. The Alliance seeks to include<br />\nand educate men in the reformation of social perceptions of<br />\n<br />\nportunities for women, comparable worth, and on women in<br />\npolitics, psychology, and history.<br />\nThe Alliance also staffs a<br />\nWomen's Center office in Levering Hall, and coordinates pot-luck<br />\n<br />\ndinners throughout the year.<br />\nIn the community, the Alliance<br />\norganizes a city-wide film series<br />\non women and provides a weekly escort service for clients of<br />\nPlanned Parenthood. (The<br />\nAlliance is decidedly \"prochoice\", which as they assert,<br />\nhas nothing to do with \"proabortion\"; rather pro-choice addresses the preservation of moral<br />\nand religious freedom as<br />\nguaranteed by the constitution.)<br />\nThe Alliance does not espouse<br />\nany specific political, moral or<br />\nreligious beliefs, other than<br />\nequality of freedom.<br />\nThe Alliance welcomes anyone<br />\nwho wishes to promote equaltiy,<br />\nwould like to discuss women's<br />\nissues or has questions concerning women in society.

Before anyone else<br />\nhad even thought of the concept<br />\nof the cold war, Orwell extrapolates from German propaganda the view of \"Europe as<br />\na vast fortress containing in itself<br />\nall the necessities of life and invulnerable to any attack from the<br />\noutside [by the Allies].

From the age of Darwin<br />\nthrough today, the argument surrounding one of the biggest questions of our time continues to rage<br />\nbetween scientists, philosophers,<br />\nand laymen. \"The Public Interest<br />\nScience,\" in the second of its five<br />\npart lecture series last Wednesday, February 18, presented<br />\nseveral points of view concerning<br />\nthis issue.<br />\nEntitled \"The Descent of<br />\nMan,\" the lecture was given in<br />\npart by Alan Walker from the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\nMedical School, and by Matt<br />\nCartmill from Duke University<br />\n<br />\nThe general theory of evolution<br />\nis that we, as humans, have<br />\nevolved from the same ancient<br />\nspecies that gave rise to the chimpanzees, apes, and orangutans.<br />\nEvidence to this hypothesis can be<br />\nfound in similarities between our<br />\nanatomy, molecular biology, and<br />\ngene sequences. It can also be<br />\nlocated in the physical remains<br />\nleft behind by ancient peoples and<br />\ncultures. The earliest sign of<br />\nevidence for a bi-pedal human<br />\n(walked on two feet) is a series<br />\nof footprints that are embedded in<br />\nsolidified volcanic ash. These<br />\nprints could be from as long ago<br />\nas 4 million years.<br />\nIf the theory that we evolved<br />\nfrom an ancient ape-like species<br />\nis correct, there should be<br />\n<br />\n\"There is a lot to be discovered<br />\nabout how we evolved... 'all the<br />\nlinks are missing\"'<br />\nMedical Center. As with all the<br />\nlectures in the series, two points<br />\nof view were presented. Walker,<br />\nbeing a scientist, discusses the<br />\nempirical, or scientific, evidence<br />\nthat defends the ideas of evolution. Cartmill, on the other hand,<br />\ntalked of the philosophical issues<br />\nthat are taken into account when<br />\ndealing with the same evidence.<br />\n<br />\nevidence of the middle stages of<br />\nthis transformation. In other<br />\nwords, there should be a \"missing link\" that still needs to be<br />\nfound. This missing link is<br />\nthought to be Homo Erectus, one<br />\nof the first species to walk on two<br />\nfeet and the one to give rise to the<br />\nhumans of today.<br />\nAt the start, not much physical<br />\n<br />\nevidence could be found, but as<br />\nof 1976, when the remains of a<br />\ntwelve-year-old boy, thought to<br />\nbe of the species Homo Erectus,<br />\nwere found, interest in the theory<br />\ntook hold. Since that day, there<br />\nhave been many other discoveries<br />\nof possible Homo Erectus remains. With the similarities that<br />\nthe remains had to present-day<br />\nhuman skeletons, and also the differences with chimp and ape<br />\nskeletons, these remains are<br />\nthought to be part of the species<br />\nthat came in between the apes and<br />\nus in the evolutionary chain.<br />\nThis is the type of evidence and<br />\ndata that Walker dealt with in his<br />\nportion of the lecture. Cartmill,<br />\non the other hand, dealt with the<br />\nphilosophy behind the various<br />\ntheories that scientists are dealing<br />\nwith today.<br />\nOne of the most important subjects that he dealt with in his part<br />\nof the lecture was the idea of what<br />\nit is that differentiates us from<br />\nanimals and other so-called lower<br />\nspecies. To him, our use of<br />\nlanguage, intelligence, and tools<br />\nare what defines us from the rest<br />\nof the animal kingdom. However,<br />\nCartmill pointed out that scientists<br />\noften manipulate data to get the<br />\nresults that they want. He illustrates this idea with several<br />\npieces of evidence. One such<br />\nmorsel of information deals with<br />\nchimpanzees and their ability to<br />\nuse human sign language. It was<br />\nshown that, given time, chimps<br />\n<br />\ncould learn and employ sign<br />\nlanguage to communicate with<br />\nhumans. As soon as this was<br />\nachieved, the definition of<br />\nlanguage was changed to the<br />\nability to use the learned words<br />\nto create new and different syntaxes and meanings. In other<br />\n<br />\nhad the largest brains. Then came<br />\ndolphins and porpoises. Clearly<br />\nthere was extensive manipulations with the data to get the<br />\nresults that the scientists wanted.<br />\nCartmill brings this theory into play with the theory of evolution by believing that \"We must<br />\n<br />\n\"We mustjustify our unique position in the universe...<br />\nwords, Cartmill sees the<br />\nmanipulation and changes of data<br />\nto be a way in which scientists get<br />\nthe results they want. In the case<br />\nof the chimps, in Cartmill's view,<br />\nthe scientists wanted to keep the<br />\nspecies \"below\" us, and<br />\ntherefore altered the interpretation of the data.<br />\nAnother case that he cited for<br />\nthe manipulation of data involved the basic premise that humans<br />\nhave the largest brains. This is<br />\nnot true if you look at a whale or<br />\nan elephant. Scientists correct this<br />\nlittle problem by stating that for<br />\nour body weight we have the<br />\nlargest brains. Here again lies a<br />\nproblem when you think of a<br />\nmouse or any small animal. The<br />\nproblem was solved by creating<br />\nlogarythm graphs and finally we,<br />\nthe humans on this here earth,<br />\n<br />\njustify our unique position in the<br />\nuniverse.\" In order to do this, he<br />\nis concerned that scientists and<br />\nother people in the field may<br />\noverlook the obvious truth to<br />\nsimply get the results they want.<br />\nWhether or not Cartmill is<br />\njustified in his claims remains to<br />\nbe seen, as does conclusive<br />\nproof of the so called \"Missing<br />\nLink\". There is a lot to be<br />\ndiscovered about how we<br />\nevolved\u2014not only is the Missing<br />\nLink missing, but \"all the links<br />\nare missing.\"<br />\nThe next lecture of the series<br />\nwill be presented on Wednesday,<br />\nMarch 4, in Mudd Lecture Hall<br />\nat 8 p.m. The topic will be AIDS.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/23<br />\n<br />\nllopkin8 science in Brief<br />\nMemory<br />\nAnd How It Works<br />\nFamily<br />\nPlanning\u2014That's<br />\nEntertainment!<br />\n<br />\nHe went on to show that these<br />\ncan be further divided into<br />\n\"How Memory Works: In- declarative and procedural<br />\nsights from the Study of classifications.

Anyone who's been<br />\nfamiliar with the international<br />\nscene for the last decade knows<br />\nthat his credentials are strong as<br />\nthe Rock of Gibraltar.<br />\nFirst off, he was an assistant to<br />\nDean Smith of North Carolina in<br />\n<br />\nMontreal, when we won in 1976.<br />\nAnd,he also helped in selecting<br />\nthe material for Bobby Knight of<br />\nIndiana in 1984.<br />\nPositives? \"Big Bad John\" is<br />\nloaded. His style of play was<br />\ncreated for the Olympics\u2014coastto-coast pressure on D, and a<br />\ngiddy-up offense, which if it<br />\ndoesn't immediately convert, is<br />\nfollowed by patient patterns.<br />\n<br />\nCoach John also knows how to<br />\nuse a long bench, which is a<br />\ndefinite asset because of the<br />\nphysical style of international<br />\nplay, and which means that at<br />\nleast 10 of the 12 U.S. Olympians<br />\nwill be sure to get their fair share<br />\nof PT.<br />\nOne other thing: Coach John<br />\nalso has a complete understanding<br />\nof international rules, and he also<br />\nspent time last summer with<br />\nCoach Lute Olsen of Arizona at<br />\nthe World Games in Madrid.<br />\nMake no mistake, he is no<br />\nstranger to the international<br />\nbullring.<br />\nSo, those are all the positives.<br />\nAll the items on the asset side of<br />\n<br />\nthe ledger. Now,I think, it's time<br />\nwe got on to the list of things on<br />\nthe liability side\u2014things that<br />\nCoach John, or for that matter,<br />\nany Olympic coach, has to deal<br />\nwith this time around.<br />\nFirst off, this is not a summer<br />\nOlympics, but a Games of the<br />\nfall, when the leaves are starting<br />\nto turn. It goes from September<br />\nto October, which creates major<br />\nheadaches for the National<br />\nBasketball Association. How, for<br />\nexample, a senior who was<br />\ndrafted in the spring be watching<br />\nthe sunset on the Yellow Sea at<br />\na time when NBA clubs are<br />\nalready through their training<br />\ncamp and getting ready for their<br />\nseason opener?<br />\nAs if that weren't enough, let's<br />\ntake a look at problem number<br />\ntwo, which concerns the athletes<br />\nwho are still in college. Right<br />\nnow, it looks like they'd be missing at least three weeks of<br />\nclass\u2014which is a no-no\u2014unless<br />\nyou figure to take 'em out for the<br />\nwhole semester. And, believe<br />\nme, that's a no-no to the poor college coach who has recruited the<br />\nkid and has him on his team.<br />\nSo what are the answers?<br />\nWell, I really believe that<br />\nDavid Stern, commissioner of the<br />\nNBA, will do everything he can<br />\nto help solve the problem with the<br />\npros, because in the past the NBA<br />\nhas done more than its fair share<br />\nto make our U.S. Olympic team<br />\nthe best that it can be\u2014both financially, and also by adjusting their<br />\nrules.<br />\nAs far as the college basketball<br />\nplayers are concerned, I think<br />\n<br />\nwhat you'll see is a reaching into<br />\nand response from the private<br />\nsector to supply a contingent of<br />\n10 to 15 tutors, who would go<br />\nthrough the training and traveling<br />\nwith the Olympic squad that we<br />\nsend to Seoul.<br />\nCoach John, quite naturally, is<br />\nreacting to all this with top hat<br />\nand cane diplomacy.<br />\nThe only comment he'll make<br />\nabout all the problems is that he<br />\nwould like to have three Patrick<br />\nEwings in his selection of a team,<br />\nand that he plans to spend quite<br />\na bit of time this year at the PanAm Games in Indianapolis,<br />\nwhere Denny Crum of Louisville<br />\nis handling the head coaching<br />\nduties. What Coach John hopes to<br />\ndo after is to get a big leg up on<br />\nevaluating the prospective<br />\nballplayers, and get some feeling<br />\non what the desires and commitments of certain players will<br />\nbe, before they start the 1987-88<br />\ncollege season.<br />\nWhat does he need?<br />\nFirst of all, he'll be looking for<br />\nplayers mainly that can play upcourt, who can defense the threepoint shot, and who are mobile as<br />\nwell as physical. Olympic games<br />\nare played in a push-shove, grunt,<br />\nmultiple-foul type style, and you<br />\nmust remember that John will not<br />\nhave the big advantage of '84,<br />\nwhen we were on our own<br />\nblacktop in LaLa Land, which<br />\nmade it super inviting for the<br />\nplayers who wanted to use the<br />\nFive Rings and the Olympic Anthem to open doors and gain exposure into the financial league,<br />\nthe NBA.<br />\n<br />\nAnother thing to remember:<br />\none of the difficult things, too,<br />\nnow that Coach John has picked<br />\nup the Olympic torch, is that he<br />\nwill have two head coaching jobs.<br />\nHe has to be careful not to put<br />\nin too much time on the Olympics, so that it might adversely affect his Hoyas, or vice-versa.<br />\nAnd, there are the constant<br />\nrumors that the pros want him,<br />\nwhich can be a fatal distraction if<br />\nhe allows it to turn his head too<br />\nsoon.<br />\nPersonally, I believe that<br />\nsomewhere down the line, John's<br />\nworld will be a poltical arena, not<br />\na sports arena. But, time will<br />\ntell. . . For right now, all that's<br />\nsure is that he'll pick his staff at<br />\nthe end of this year, and until then<br />\nhe'll use his own staff at<br />\nGeorgetown to help run things, to<br />\nkeep things orderly within the<br />\ntwo programs.<br />\nYou know, it's ironic. When<br />\nJohn Thompson was a senior at<br />\nProvidence in 1964, he tried to<br />\nmake the Olympic team that was<br />\ngoing to Tokyo, and ended up in<br />\nHeartbreak Hotel. And now, how<br />\nthe world turns\u2014here we are approximately a quarter-century later,<br />\nand now he's the head man,<br />\nNumero Uno.<br />\nPersonally, I'm really pleased<br />\nthat I'll be in this giant's shadow,<br />\nwhen I'm covering the Games in<br />\nSeoul for the Peacock in '88. For<br />\nnow, we can only wish him\u2014and<br />\nhis eventual team which has yet<br />\nto be born\u2014the best.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/27<br />\n<br />\n\\otes Cc ffi0<br />\n<br />\nCc<br />\n\"Normalization\" in Poland.

But we<br />\nprefer, if we're going to get our<br />\nhair cut at a moderate price, to<br />\nchannel our money into a small<br />\nbusiness, closely held and without a<br />\nlot of overhead for fancy \"atmosphere,\" advertising, and corporate superstructure.

The<br />\nonly formal definition available in<br />\nprior years was that the awards<br />\nwere to be given to no more than<br />\nfive percent of the graduating<br />\nclass in recognition of their involvement in extracurricular<br />\nactivities.<br />\nThis definition has now been<br />\naccomplished, according to a<br />\npreliminary outline of the committee's work: \"The Student Activities Award shall be given as<br />\nrecognition for meritorious and<br />\noutstanding contributions to student activities during the recipient's undergradute years at The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University.\"<br />\nA list of \"criteria for selecting<br />\nrecipients\" follows. These<br />\ncriteria include requirements of<br />\ninvolvement for three to four<br />\nyears, leadership positions in student organizations, membership<br />\nin more than one organization,<br /><br />\nand which activities shotild be<br />\ncounted. Non-SAC activities such<br />\nas fraternities are considered but<br />\npaid positions and athletics do<br />\nnot. Pan said that although the<br />\ncriteria are only guidelines rather<br />\nthan aboslute requirements, once<br />\ndefined they will be very firm.<br />\nPan and fellow committee<br />\nmember Sa Surmeli favored retaining the five percent limit on<br />\nthe number of awards given,<br />\nwhile Student Council President<br />\nMark Komisky and several others<br />\npresnt argued that the limit makes<br />\nthe awards overly competitive,<br />\namong other considerations.<br />\nKomisky also mentioned that<br />\nthe combination of the requirements for membership in<br />\nmore than one organization and<br />\nfor having held a leadership position \"will cut off a lot already.\"<br />\nPan said that since the new<br />\nguidelines are similar to those actually, informally used by the<br />\ncommittee last year, this effect<br />\nshould not be as pronounced as it<br />\nmight seem.<br />\nBrad Marks, senior class<br />\nrepresentative to the Student<br />\nCouncil, asked, \"Whoever<br />\ndeserves it, why not give them<br />\none?\" Surmeli described the purpose of the limit: \"What we're<br />\nsaying, five percent, is arbitrary,<br />\nbut 'outstanding' means 'above<br />\nthe crowd' and you have to decide<br />\nwho is the crowd.\"<br />\nPan emphasized that the five<br />\npercent limit is the upper figure<br />\nand said that he would prefer to<br />\nhave a three percent mean<br />\nbecause the number of deserving<br />\nstudents varies with the class in<br />\nquestion.<br /><br />\nThe process of the award selections was also discussed. No<br />\ndefinite decision has been reached, but Pan suggested that letters<br />\ndescribing the awards and the<br />\nprocess be sent out to all seniors<br />\nand juniors three weeks before<br />\nnominations for the awards are<br />\ndue.<br />\nPoster and a News-Letter ad<br />\nwill also be used to increase student awarness of the procedure,<br />\nalthough it was noted by a<br />\nmember of the junior class that,<br />\n\"No one ever reads the NewsLetter.\" One argument against<br />\nthe award selections in previous<br />\nyears was that insufficient prior<br />\npublicity resulted in deserving<br />\nstudents not being nominated.<br />\nWhen nomination letters are<br />\nreceived by a nine-member committee consisting of the executive<br />\ncommittee of the Union Board<br />\nand two representatives from the<br />\nsenior class, the letters will be<br />\ndivided up among the members of<br />\nthe committee and scrutinized,<br />\naccording to Pan. Telephone interviews<br />\nof<br />\nnominees,<br />\n\"preferably by people who don't<br />\nknow [them],\" will be conducted<br />\nby the committee.<br />\nThe committee will then<br />\nprepare a list of candidates for the<br />\nawards, which must then be approved by the SAC and the Student Council.

I was vice-president of the<br />\nfreshman class, this year I was<br />\npresident of the junior class, and<br />\nI served on the Buildings and<br />\nGrounds Committee and worked<br />\non the Social Committee,<br />\norganized a lot of social events.<br />\nOutside of the University, I've<br />\nbeen involved in some cultural<br />\norganizations and organizing<br />\nthem, so I do know how to get<br />\nthings organized, work with the<br />\nSAC and the administration.<br />\nI'm very motivated. I'm excited about the whole opportunity. I think that the Student Council's been going pretty well this<br />\nyear. They've covered a wide<br />\nrange of topics. The only fault I<br />\nfind with the whole process is that<br />\nsometimes you do a lot of work<br />\nand nothing comes of it, and<br />\nhopefully if we can help develop<br />\nsome kind of power of the Student Council, as the IFC is working towards that this year,<br />\nhopefully the Student Council<br />\nwill be able to have more direct<br />\ninput into the University.<br />\nN-L: Would that be your top<br />\npriority as President, or do you<br />\nhave another top priority?<br />\nSurmeli: I think that my major<br />\npriority would be to help the Student Council develop.

Obviously, if you know<br />\nsomeone, you have a better<br />\nchance of knowing if he's<br />\nqualified.<br />\nBut I think there is a problem<br />\nthat people don't know about the<br />\nfact that there is this committee<br />\nchair opening, someone's got to<br />\nchair this committee, that, that,<br />\nthat, all the standing committees,<br />\nad hoc committees on the<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe problem comes down to if<br />\nthere are a couple of committees<br /><br />\nthat people want to chair, ana<br />\nthen there are a bunch that people don't, and you've got fine<br />\npeople to fill them all, and fill<br />\nthem well, I don't think there's<br />\nany problem in the system right<br />\nnow.<br />\nThere is one problem that<br />\nCouncil brought up once or<br />\ntwice, and it sort of faded out,<br />\nwith the COC.

The<br />\nfaculty, students, and staff who must<br />\ncommute to Homewood take inordinate<br />\nand unnecessary risks in making the<br />\ntrip. In a city like Baltimore with a small<br />\nsnow removal system, asking<br />\nemployees and students to travel during<br />\na snowstorm is asking for a disaster.<br />\nFurthermore, staying \"open\" during<br />\na storm becomes an adventure in the absurd since only a small number of faculty members actually arrive to teach.<br />\nWe believe that the most prudent<br />\ncourse of action is to close the University when large storms hit, even if the<br />\nschool year must be extended to account<br />\nfor the lost time. There is no reason to<br />\nendanger Hopkins' students and staff for<br />\nthe \"heroic\" distinction of being the on(which was the wimpiest of the three ly school in Maryland not to close<br />\nbecause of Nature's wrath.

We hope Monday's<br /><br />\nMonday was a strange day at<br />\nHomewood indeed. For the first time<br />\nwe can remember, Hopkins closed<br />\nbecause of the weather. We were<br />\ndelighted.<br />\nCertainly, the announcement of a sudden holiday from classes was cause for<br />\nhappiness for most students and faculty. But what pleased us especially was<br />\nnot the respite from work, but the<br />\nresponsibility the University showed by<br />\nthe closing.<br />\nIn the last month, three large storms<br />\nhave paralyzed the city, closing schools,<br />\nbusinesses, and state offices. Nevertheless, during the first two storms,<br />\nHopkins administrators chose to brave<br />\nthe weather while virtually every other<br />\nschool in the state, from kindergarten<br />\non up, shut down.<br />\nSo, the announcement of Monday's<br />\nclosing in response to the latest storm<br /><br />\nThe N-L Hoopla<br />\nThis was a difficult week for us at the<br />\nNews-Letter. In addition to the usual<br />\nmechanical failures, early morning<br />\nemergencies, and administrative worries, we were the target of a barrage of<br />\nletters to the editor, telephone calls, and<br />\nthreats. At the risk of committing that<br />\npotential journalistic sin known as a selfreferential editorial, we have decided to<br />\ncomment on the N-L hoopla.<br />\nLast week, as faithful readers of our<br />\npages will recall, we printed a letter to<br />\nthe editor by Joseph D. Terwilliger of<br />\nthe Peabody Institute. In the letter, Terwilliger argued that John Demjanjuk<br />\n(the former Cleveland auto worker on<br />\ntrial in Israel for his alleged crimes during the Holocaust) and other suspected<br />\nNazi war criminals should not be hunted<br />\nor prosecuted. Terwilliger also questioned \"the proof that there really was<br />\na Holocaust.\"<br />\nThis week, we received a stack of letters responding to Terwilliger's comments. (The letters can be found<br />\nelsewhere on these pages.) In addition,<br />\nwe have been told by many that the<br />\nNews-Letter's printing of Terwilliger's<br />\nletter was shocking and appalling. We<br />\nhave even received a number of<br />\nmessages from the more radial<br />\nelements of the Hopkins Community<br />\nthreatening that the News-Letter<br /><br />\nGatehouse may be burned down for<br />\nprinting the letter.<br />\nSuch threats and comments scare us,<br />\nnot because we are afraid someone will<br />\nactually torch the Gatehouse (although<br />\nthat tactic is being used with all too great<br />\na frequency here at Hopkins) but<br />\nbecause such comments show an alarming disrespect for the right to freedom<br />\nof expression.<br />\nWe are certainly in disagreement with<br />\nTerwilliger's interpretation of history.<br />\nNevertheless, we strongly defend Terwilliger's right to express his ideas here<br />\non these pages.<br />\nAfter all, we have an obligation to<br />\nprint ideas even when\u2014perhaps<br />\nespecially when\u2014 those ideas are in<br />\nmost direct conflict with our own.<br />\nThis week, we were happy to see Terwilliger's ideas debated thoroughly. For<br />\nthe most part, the letters we received<br />\nseem to treat Terwilliger's letter in a<br />\nresponsible and constructive (although<br />\nsomewhat repetitive) fashion.<br />\nWe hope that all members of the community will continue to use these pages<br />\nas a forum for responsible discussion of<br />\nissues of concern to the community. For<br />\nour part, we intend to do everything<br />\npossible to ensure that reasonable letters meeting our loose production<br />\nguidelines will be printed.<br /><br />\nIt has come to my attention that<br />\nDr. Steven David has been denied<br />\npromotion from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor by<br />\nthe Academic Council of the<br />\nUniversity. What makes this<br />\nnews particularly astonishing is<br />\nthat David had the unanimous<br />\nsupport of the Department of<br />\nPolitical Science in the question<br />\nof his promotion. The fact that<br /><br />\nheavy course load and administrative duties, may have<br />\nresulted in his denial of promotion is ironic and unfair.<br />\nI understand the premium that<br />\nis placed on scholarly writing by<br />\nthe University and, to a certain<br />\nextent, I agree with it; one of the<br />\nfunctions of a university is to advance scholarly research and<br />\nwriting in all fields of study. But<br /><br />\ndave meiselman<br />\nDavid will be forced to leave the<br />\nUniversity at the conclusion of<br />\nthis semester is a great shock to<br />\nthose in the International Studies<br />\nmajor and Political Science<br />\nDepartment, and a tragedy for<br />\nanyone who has taken a course<br />\nwith him.<br />\nDavid is widely regarded as<br />\none of the best professors on campus; I believe he is the best. He<br />\nis an excellent lecturer, and his<br />\nclasses and teaching are directly<br />\nresponsible for the International<br />\nStudies major becoming one of<br />\nthe largest undergraduate majors.<br />\nHis administration of the IR program and his advising of<br />\ncountless students have provided<br />\na stability and continuity to a major which is not a major in and of<br />\nitself. I can say from personal experience that his advice has been<br />\ninvaluable to me in decisions<br />\nregarding my academic pursuits<br />\nand ultimately my vocational<br />\nfuture.<br />\nTo take David away from the<br />\nDepartment would cause an<br />\nalready troubled major to digress<br />\ninto chaos. As stated above, he<br />\nhas been the only thing that has<br />\nlent stability and continuity to<br />\nthe program. The fact that his efforts to maintain the quality of the<br />\nIR program, including his very<br /><br />\nto place a premium on writing to<br />\nsuch an extent that it becomes allencompassing is to forget the<br />\nprimary function that a university should fulfill\u2014the teaching of<br />\nyoung minds. David has done<br />\nmore than any other to advance<br />\nmy education. To deprive future<br />\nHopkins students of his expertise<br />\nwould be a great disservice to<br />\nhim, to them, to those who have<br />\nbenefited from him, and to the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nI believe that given his extraordinary teaching ability and his<br />\ncontributions to his department<br />\nand students, the Council should<br />\ngive him the benefit of the doubt<br />\nthat in the coming years his<br />\nscholarly works will be on the<br />\nforefront of his field.

When<br />\nnewcomers to the camps were<br />\ncremated the fat on their bodies<br />\nmade the smoke black.

Terwilliger's proNazi letter is screaming for a<br />\nresponse. His main point, not<br />\nprosecuting 40-year-old Nazi<br />\ncrimes against World War II<br />\nJews, can be easily refuted. Our<br />\njudicial system is based on<br />\nreform, but we must not let people go unpunished for some of the<br />\nmost hideous crimes committed<br />\nin this century. If we were to let<br />\nthese Nazi offenders get away<br />\nwith their crimes, we are subtly<br />\nencouraging others to perpetrate<br />\nsuch atrocities and go into hiding<br />\nfor forty years of \"punishment\"<br />\n(according to Terwilliger). This<br />\nis not punishment considering<br />\nthese Nazis were rolling in dough<br />\nin their hide-outs in South<br />\nAmerica. May we ask what<br />\nschool of thought doubts the existence of the Holocaust? Could<br />\nit be the Neo-Nazis living in the<br />\nnorthwestern parts of America?

The author, Joseph<br />\nD. Terwilliger, referred to the<br />\n\"alleged Nazi Holocaust of the<br />\nJews,\" and the \"alleged crimes<br />\nof the Nazis.\" He went on to state<br />\nthat there are no facts that can<br />\nsuccessfully prove that a<br />\nHolocaust actually existed. What<br />\nwould Mr. Terwilliger suggest<br />\nhappened to the six million Jews<br />\nthat died during this period, including a large portion of my<br />\nfamily? Did they vanish into thin<br />\nair? How does Mr. Terwilliger account for Holocaust survivors,<br />\nwitnesses to the abhorrent<br />\ncrimes? Did they imagine this<br />\nhorror? In response to the opinion<br />\nthat we should leave these<br />\n\"helpless old men\" alone, I point<br />\nout that millions of people never<br />\nreached old age due to the actions<br />\nof these men.. It is a sad state we<br />\nare in when an educated young<br />\nperson, such as Mr. Terwilliger,<br />\nis willing to change history in an<br />\nattempt to justify his anti-Semitic<br />\nsentiment.<br /><br />\nTerwilliger III<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe letter that appeared in last<br /><br />\nThe comments of Mr. Terwilliger last week, have convinced me to write to your paper. It<br />\nsurprised me slightly, that he<br />\nbrought up his opinion that the<br />\nHolocaust might never have hap-<br /><br />\npened, but what surprised me<br />\neven more was the response I got<br />\nfrom my peers after discussing<br />\nthe letter with them. Most of them<br />\nthought that the letter was \"one<br />\nperson's opinion,\" and \"no<br />\nthreat to sensible people like you<br />\nand me.\"<br />\nThe truth of the matter was that<br />\nthe writer hit it right on the nail<br />\nwhen he said that there was a<br />\n\"school of thought\" pertaining to<br />\nthe matter at hand. There is a big<br />\nmovement in the United States<br />\n(led by a Jew, of all the irony!)<br />\nwhich supports the claim that<br />\nthere never was a Holocaust. This<br />\ngroup has even gone to such extremes as to go to court and accuse Holocaust survivors of<br />\nfraudery and deceit, claiming that<br />\nthe Holocaust was \"The Ultimate<br />\nLie!\"<br />\nSuch claims are an insult not<br />\nonly to Jews, (which comprise<br />\nnearly 30 percent of this campus),<br />\nbut also to Blacks, (which comprise an additional 10 percent),<br />\nand to homosexuals as well (an<br />\nadditional 10 percent) who also<br />\nsuffered greatly at the hands of<br />\nthe Nazis.<br />\nIf Hitler were alive today, he<br />\nwould probably laugh at the fact<br />\nthat he killed 6 million+ ,without<br />\nsome people even noticing. It is<br />\ntrue that this did happen over<br />\nforty years ago, and that those<br />\nsouls killed at the hands of the<br />\nNazis can never be brought back,<br />\nbut the least we can do is<br />\nremember them. Unfortunately,<br />\nsome of us can't even do that<br />\nminimum.<br />\nEfrem L. Epstein<br /><br />\nTerwilliger VI<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAfter reading Mr. Terwilligei's letter in the Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter, I felt obligated to<br />\nreply to the statements and innuendoes that abound. There is a<br />\ngreat temptation to analyze each<br />\nline to show the misconception<br />\nand faulty logic used in the letter.<br />\nFor the sake of brevity, I will only comment on five points.<br />\n1. The statement that only<br />\n150,000 Jews perished during the<br />\nSecond World War can easily be<br />\ndisproved. One method would be<br />\nto interview the Jews living in this<br />\narea and Mr. Terwilliger will find<br />\nthat the number of relatives and<br />\nacquaintances lost by these Jews<br />\nfar exceeds 150,000. I will be<br />\nglad to meet with Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nto discuss other ways to determine the enormity of the<br />\nHolocaust.<br />\n2. The statement that seems to<br />\nsay that if some criminals are not<br />\nbrought to justice (for whatever<br />\nreason) none should be punished<br />\nis ludicrous.<br />\n3. I cannot understand the logic<br />\nwhich compares the bombing of<br />\ncities in a war situation to the<br />\nsystematic elimination of people<br />\non the basis of race or creed. To<br />\nequate both situations elevated the<br />\nHolocaust to war crimes, while in<br />\nreality, it was an act devoid of all<br />\nhuman feelings.

He believes that<br />\nthese criminals who have done<br />\n\"nothing wrong\" in the past 43<br />\nyears should not be prosecuted<br />\nbecause they are \"harmless,\" to<br />\nour present society. Furthermore,<br />\nhe states that it is unfair to punish<br />\nGermans for crimes that they<br />\nhave committed since others have<br />\nnot been punished for their own<br />\ncrimes.<br />\nI suppose that Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nadvocated that we should not<br />\nbring rapists and murderers to<br />\ntrial since others, who have committed the same crime, escape<br />\nprosecution.

In fact, we urge Mr. Terwilliger to seek out some of the<br />\nsurvivors of the camps. They<br />\nmight be able to change his mind<br />\nconcerning any \"alleged\" Nazi<br />\nHolocaust.<br />\nWe admit that we were initially a bit stunned by the International Red Cross figure Mr. Terwilliger quoted, though we now<br />\nfeel we can clear up his<br />\nmisconception. It must have been<br />\nexceedingly difficult to (a) count<br />\nbodies and (b)determine religious<br />\naffiliations, of those who were<br />\ncremated at any of the various<br />\ndeath camps. The same holds true<br />\nfor those who were shot in front<br />\nof pits. Their bodies were only<br />\nburied by more bodies. So we<br />\ndon't doubt that Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nquoted the figure of only 150,000<br />\nJews correctly. The majority of<br />\nhistorians tell us that over 11<br />\nmillion people were killed by the<br />\nNazis. Over 6 million of those<br />\nwere Jews.<br />\nAs for Mr. Terwilliger's feelings that it is \"unfair\" to put<br />\nformer Nazis on trial, we feel<br />\nfairness was not in the minds of<br />\nthese same former Nazis during<br />\nthe Holocaust. Furthermore, we<br />\ndo not agree that hiding is<br />\n\"punishment enough.\" There is<br />\nno statute of limitations in this<br />\ncountry, and neither should there<br />\nbe. We feel that these people<br />\nshould be sought out and put on<br />\ntrial, and that the entire world<br />\nshould learn every detail of the<br />\natrocities in which they<br /><br />\nparticipated.<br />\nWe encourage Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nto attend the Holocaust events the<br />\nHopkins Jewish League is planning for April.

The<br />\nHolocaust was committed or aided by a great many groups.

Yet, few<br />\namong us would approve of the<br />\nattempts to exterminate a nation<br />\nas an indirect outcome of the<br />\ndivine battle against communism.<br />\nYou, Mr. Terwilliger, belong to<br />\nthe latter group. Though I am inclined to agree with you that today's Nazis may very well be<br />\nharmless, the group which you<br />\nrepresent is not!<br />\nWith a prophetic tone, and a<br />\nnewly found self-identity, Mr.<br />\nTerwilliger proceeds: \"Let us<br />\nstop living with the horrors of the<br />\npast. We must all join together,<br />\nwhites, blacks, orientals, and<br />\nJewish persons, to fight against<br />\nthe true enemy of freedom, cornmunish.\" Mr. Terwilliger, in this<br />\nmoving statement, I had found a<br />\ncharisma unmatched by any but<br />\nthe electrifying speeches of Adolf<br />\nHitler.

First, Mr. Terwilliger claims that \"any Nazis<br />\nwho may yet be alive are in fact<br />\nharmless.\" The current danger<br />\nthat these 'former' criminals pose<br />\nis not a factor. Demanjuk and<br />\nothers must be punished for the<br />\ncrimes that they committed, with<br />\nno regard to the passage of time.<br />\nAdditionally, for Mr. Terwilliger's information, Neo-Nazi<br />\ngroups are alive and well in the<br />\nUnited States. Groups such as<br />\nThe Order and The League of<br />\nAryan Nations not only spread<br />\ntheir rascist propaganda, but have<br />\nattempted to act as well. A huge<br />\ncache of arms was recently confiscated from The Order. The<br />\nLeague of Aryan Nations held a<br />\nconference this summer in Cour<br />\nD'Alene, Idaho to attempt to turn<br />\nthe northwest states into an Aryan<br />\nnation. When a local church<br />\nleader spoke out against them, his<br />\nhouse was firebombed. Although<br />\n43 years have passed, these<br />\n'former' criminals and all that<br />\nthey stand for still pose a threat<br />\nto mankind.<br />\nMr. Terwilliger does not stop<br />\nhere, however. He goes on to<br />\nclaim that the Holocaust never occurred. If, as Mr. Terwilliger<br />\nsays, \"150,000 Jews died of all<br />\ncauses between 1939 and 1944,\"<br />\nhow does he explain the utterly<br />\ngruesome pictures of piles of<br />\nteeth, hair and personal belongings publicly printed. How does<br />\nhe explain the stench of seared<br />\nhuman flesh that still hangs over<br />\nAuschwitz, Poland 43 years<br />\nlater? In the next few weeks we<br />\nwill hear testimony in the Demaniuk trial from survivors of the<br /><br />\nScott David Lippe<br />\nDirector, Hopkins Jewish League<br /><br />\nTerwilliger XIII<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA recent letter published in the<br />\nNews-Letter announced: \"We<br />\nshould not persecute Nazis. They<br />\nat least realized the worst threat<br />\nto human freedom in history,<br />\nsocialism, and the arch-evil, communism.\" It is ironic that Mr.<br />\nTerwilliger's letter recognizes a<br />\nhumanitarian value in the actions<br />\nof Nazi-Germany for having<br />\nthreatened communism. As to<br />\ndetails such as the alleged attempt<br />\nof Nazi-Germany to wipe out the<br />\nJewish nation, Mr. Terwilliger<br />\npromptly points out: \". . . until<br />\nthe acts introduced by the<br />\nHolocaust revisionists can be successfully countered, there can be<br />\nno proof that there really was a<br />\nHolocaust.\" Yet, Mr. Terwilliger is aware that history cannot be revised, it is simply<br />\nrecorded for us to contemplate.<br />\nEven more astonishing is Mr.<br />\nTerwilliger's lack of understanding regarding the purpose of the<br />\nNazi trials: \"The alleged crimes<br />\nof the Nazis occurred 40 years<br />\nago, so give it a rest. Any Nazis<br />\nwho may yet be alive are in fact<br />\nharmless.\" Nazi trials do not<br />\nserve as means of retribution but<br />\nrather as means of com-<br /><br />\nTreblinka death camp.

It is no better or worse than the other gimmicks of television. Like the talk,<br />\nit is different only in its proportion.

The<br />\ncharacters stepped out and wished everybody in audience-land<br />\nhappy holidays. In the season<br />\nfinale, after a ludicrous chase<br />\nscene, the guest stars, Whoopi<br />\nGoldberg and Judd Nelson, were<br />\ncalled away to their limos and the<br />\nplot came to a halt. The<br />\ncharacters left for the summer,<br />\ntantalizing<br />\npromising<br />\ndevelopments. On this out-ofcontrol scale, the gimmick makes<br />\ngood on its promise. However<br />\nannoying it may be, the<br />\nmechanical details of the episode<br />\nplot are sacrificed to the ongoing<br /><br />\ncomedy and romance of the series<br />\nplot (or, everything is sacrificed<br />\nto the ratings).<br />\nImpossible to overlook in this<br />\nawareness business is the fact that<br />\nDavid and Maddie, even when<br />\nthey give you a hint they know<br />\nthey are on camera, remain David<br />\nand Maddie.

Carey<br />\nThomas, was repeatedly denied<br />\naccess to education at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. As a result<br />\nof her determined efforts to enter<br />\nthe University, Thomas was<br />\neventually permitted to sit in the<br />\nrear of the lecture, screened from<br />\nview of the male students. The<br />\nM. Carey Thomas Feminist<br />\nAlliance is so named in respect<br />\nfor her efforts.<br />\nThe Alliance, composed of approximately fifteen active female<br />\nand male members, is attempting<br />\nto promote equality and further<br />\ntolerance of the issues of women.<br />\nThe Alliance is not nationally affiliated. Its definition of<br />\n\"feminism\" is therefore determined by individual members,<br /><br />\nand is not associated with common stereotypical perceptions of<br />\nthe word \"feminism\". In<br />\npopular<br />\na<br />\ncountering<br />\nremonstrance, the Alliance is not<br />\na band of hysterical androgynous<br /><br />\nfrom a patriarchal to a matriarchal structure: rather, the<br />\nAlliance is working to challenge<br />\nsocial misconceptions of the role<br />\nof women in society, to create<br />\nsolidarity and self-perception<br /><br />\nwomen.<br />\nOn campus the Alliance has<br />\nself-defense<br />\norganized<br />\nworkshops, and provided<br />\nseminars on birth control,<br />\nfeminization of poverty, job op-<br /><br />\nELEL3i<br />\niL<br /><br />\nELIADE<br />\nwomen running about in search of<br />\na cause. The Alliance perceives<br />\nsociety as non-meritocratic and<br />\npatriarchal. Its goal is not, as<br />\nmany believe, to simply switch<br />\nthe unequal balance of perception<br /><br />\namong women, to secure the betterment of the lifestyles of<br />\nwomen, and to strive for equality. The Alliance seeks to include<br />\nand educate men in the reformation of social perceptions of<br /><br />\nportunities for women, comparable worth, and on women in<br />\npolitics, psychology, and history.<br />\nThe Alliance also staffs a<br />\nWomen's Center office in Levering Hall, and coordinates pot-luck<br /><br />\ndinners throughout the year.<br />\nIn the community, the Alliance<br />\norganizes a city-wide film series<br />\non women and provides a weekly escort service for clients of<br />\nPlanned Parenthood. (The<br />\nAlliance is decidedly \"prochoice\", which as they assert,<br />\nhas nothing to do with \"proabortion\"; rather pro-choice addresses the preservation of moral<br />\nand religious freedom as<br />\nguaranteed by the constitution.)<br />\nThe Alliance does not espouse<br />\nany specific political, moral or<br />\nreligious beliefs, other than<br />\nequality of freedom.<br />\nThe Alliance welcomes anyone<br />\nwho wishes to promote equaltiy,<br />\nwould like to discuss women's<br />\nissues or has questions concerning women in society.

This is<br />\nsimilar to the trick Roth used in<br />\nhis 1974 novel, My Life as a<br />\nMan, where the first part of the<br /><br />\nbook turned out to be fiction<br />\nwithin fiction. In The Counterlife,<br />\nthe trick is so complete that Part<br />\nFive of the novel has no bearing<br />\non the \"real\" actions of the<br />\ncharacters.<br />\nThe main flaw of the book, actually, is that it can be read<br />\nwithout the last seventy pages.<br />\nPart Three ties together the theme<br />\nof Judaism and the reality of fiction by drawing a parallel between Zuckerman and Israel. Part<br />\nFour clears up the apparently<br />\ncontradictory plots. Once themes<br />\nand plots are worked through,<br />\nRoth continues only to elaborate<br />\non Zuckerman's Jewishness.<br />\nWhile Part Five is as interesting<br />\nand as eloquent as the rest of the<br />\nbook, it fails to add any crucial<br />\ninformation which would make it<br />\nan integral part of the work.<br />\nThough The Counterlife is not<br />\nPhilip Roth's most perfect novel,'<br />\nit is his most ambitious. After<br />\nreading the first dozen pages, it<br />\nis clear that the author is in complete control and knows exactly<br />\nwhat he's doing. The characters<br />\nare colorful and the writing witty, and the result is the most intriguing and complex novel Roth<br />\nhas yet produced.

He gets caught, is tor-<br /><br />\ntured, but thanks to Yankee ingenuity, he escapes mildly hurt<br />\nand meets up with his Allied buddies. Of course he has obtained<br />\nthe critical information that will<br />\nchange the tide of the war and<br />\nmake all the Pacific \"again\" safe<br />\nfor democracy, Western style.<br />\nUnfortunately democracy isn't<br />\ntoo safe now in the Pacific, e.g.,<br />\nin the Philippines, but an event<br />\ndeep within the bowels of the<br />\nLondon BBC studios around the<br />\nsame time Ferdinand Marcos<br />\n\"left\" his country provides the<br />\ncontents of Orwell: The War<br />\nCommentaries. William J. West,<br />\na foremost propaganda scholar,<br />\nuncovered previously lost texts of<br />\nactual World War II radio broadcasts by the master political commentator, George Orwell.<br />\nFiled away in cabinets in BBC<br />\narchives, Orwell's speeches<br />\nanalyze the war and its effects at<br />\nhome and abroad starting with the<br />\nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbor<br />\nin 1941 and ending in February<br />\n1943, thus covering the most<br />\ncritical period for Allied victory.<br />\nWest notes that \"the coming of<br />\nradio early in this century gave<br />\nthe ancient art of propaganda an<br />\nentirely new dimension, one that<br />\nwas to prove particularly useful<br />\nin time of war.\"<br />\nOrwell: The War Commentaries provides a blow-by-blow<br />\naccount of World War II, and at<br />\ntimes reads like a slanted firstaccount textbook that injects optimism into Allied affronts and<br />\ndownplays Axis short-term<br />\nvictories\u2014similar to an old World<br />\nWar II movie. These news broadcasts did provide morale for the<br />\nBritish civilian population, but I<br /><br />\nthink the general reader of today<br />\nmight not sit at the edge of his<br />\nseat while reading about, for example, the reinforcement of<br />\nJapanese troops in Burma. What<br />\nI find to be much more interesting<br />\nthan the main texts are the censored passages which have been<br />\npublished despite their omission<br />\nin the orignal broadcasts.<br />\nA typical, \"too harsh\" passage<br />\nin one of Orwell's speeches dated<br />\nfrom March 14, 1942. \"The<br />\nBritish people are disciplining<br />\nthemselves yet harder for the<br />\ndemands of total war. The<br />\npenalties against those who<br />\noperate the Black Market in food<br />\nhave been stiffened up, so that offenders can now get as much as<br />\nfourteen years imprisonment.<br />\nWhite flour is to be withdrawn<br />\nfrom the market shortly, and only wheatmeal flour allowed. . . It<br />\nis probable also that the use of<br />\npetrol for mere pleasure or convenience will shortly be prohibited. No one complains of the<br />\nrestrictions\u2014on the contrary, the<br />\ngeneral public are demanding that<br />\nthe restrictions shall be made<br />\neven stricter, so that the selfish<br />\nminority who behave as though<br />\nBritian were not at war can be<br />\ndealt with. . .\"If you have ever<br />\nread Nineteen Eighty-Four, the<br />\n\"Cripps\" tone of the last<br />\nsentence should have struck you.<br />\nRationing in a war-time economy<br />\nis no light subject, and these<br />\nsublimely cynical comments did<br />\nnot pass the censor. Actual events<br />\nand ideas from his Commentaries<br />\nled Orwell later to write shocking and cautionary tales of the<br />\nnear future, most notably Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal<br /><br />\nFarm.<br />\nAnother interesting point<br />\nbrought up in Orwell's Commentaries is the idea of the endless<br />\nstate of war. Before anyone else<br />\nhad even thought of the concept<br />\nof the cold war, Orwell extrapolates from German propaganda the view of \"Europe as<br />\na vast fortress containing in itself<br />\nall the necessities of life and invulnerable to any attack from the<br />\noutside [by the Allies]. Within<br />\nthis fortress, of course, the German people will be the master<br />\nrace, and the other European<br />\npeoples will be reduced to varying degrees of serfdom. No<br />\ndoubt, the main object. . . is to<br />\nreconcile the German people to a<br />\nprospect of endless war and at the<br />\nsame time persuade the Allies that<br />\nfurther attacks are useless.\"<br />\nOrwell develops the system of<br />\nsuper powers in an endless state<br />\nof war, alternately hot and cold,<br />\nlater in Nineten Eighty-Four.<br />\nI can't see anyone buying and<br />\nreading The Commentaries unless<br />\nhe or she either is interested in<br />\nWorld War II confrontations, or<br />\nis politically inclined and has a<br />\ncuriosity for propaganda techniques. The specificity of this book<br />\nimitates that of a history text, and<br />\nat times it stresses minor points<br />\nwhich, during the war must have<br />\nbeen important, but now are of<br />\nlittle interest to most non-history<br />\nor non-political science students.<br />\nUnfortunately, monumental<br />\nstudies and documentations lose<br />\ntheir gravity with the passage of<br />\ntime, except to those people who<br />\nsee the importance of learning<br />\nfrom the past.<br /><br />\n22/FEBRUARY 27, 1987<br /><br />\nScience<br /><br />\nA Global Ecologist with a Human Touch<br />\nby Joseph M.

These motivations were<br />\nthe primary reason why Stine<br />\nreturned to school as a stlident in<br />\n1969.

From the age of Darwin<br />\nthrough today, the argument surrounding one of the biggest questions of our time continues to rage<br />\nbetween scientists, philosophers,<br />\nand laymen. \"The Public Interest<br />\nScience,\" in the second of its five<br />\npart lecture series last Wednesday, February 18, presented<br />\nseveral points of view concerning<br />\nthis issue.<br />\nEntitled \"The Descent of<br />\nMan,\" the lecture was given in<br />\npart by Alan Walker from the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\nMedical School, and by Matt<br />\nCartmill from Duke University<br /><br />\nThe general theory of evolution<br />\nis that we, as humans, have<br />\nevolved from the same ancient<br />\nspecies that gave rise to the chimpanzees, apes, and orangutans.<br />\nEvidence to this hypothesis can be<br />\nfound in similarities between our<br />\nanatomy, molecular biology, and<br />\ngene sequences. It can also be<br />\nlocated in the physical remains<br />\nleft behind by ancient peoples and<br />\ncultures. The earliest sign of<br />\nevidence for a bi-pedal human<br />\n(walked on two feet) is a series<br />\nof footprints that are embedded in<br />\nsolidified volcanic ash. These<br />\nprints could be from as long ago<br />\nas 4 million years.<br />\nIf the theory that we evolved<br />\nfrom an ancient ape-like species<br />\nis correct, there should be<br /><br />\n\"There is a lot to be discovered<br />\nabout how we evolved... 'all the<br />\nlinks are missing\"'<br />\nMedical Center. As with all the<br />\nlectures in the series, two points<br />\nof view were presented. Walker,<br />\nbeing a scientist, discusses the<br />\nempirical, or scientific, evidence<br />\nthat defends the ideas of evolution. Cartmill, on the other hand,<br />\ntalked of the philosophical issues<br />\nthat are taken into account when<br />\ndealing with the same evidence.<br /><br />\nevidence of the middle stages of<br />\nthis transformation. In other<br />\nwords, there should be a \"missing link\" that still needs to be<br />\nfound. This missing link is<br />\nthought to be Homo Erectus, one<br />\nof the first species to walk on two<br />\nfeet and the one to give rise to the<br />\nhumans of today.<br />\nAt the start, not much physical<br /><br />\nevidence could be found, but as<br />\nof 1976, when the remains of a<br />\ntwelve-year-old boy, thought to<br />\nbe of the species Homo Erectus,<br />\nwere found, interest in the theory<br />\ntook hold. Since that day, there<br />\nhave been many other discoveries<br />\nof possible Homo Erectus remains. With the similarities that<br />\nthe remains had to present-day<br />\nhuman skeletons, and also the differences with chimp and ape<br />\nskeletons, these remains are<br />\nthought to be part of the species<br />\nthat came in between the apes and<br />\nus in the evolutionary chain.<br />\nThis is the type of evidence and<br />\ndata that Walker dealt with in his<br />\nportion of the lecture. Cartmill,<br />\non the other hand, dealt with the<br />\nphilosophy behind the various<br />\ntheories that scientists are dealing<br />\nwith today.<br />\nOne of the most important subjects that he dealt with in his part<br />\nof the lecture was the idea of what<br />\nit is that differentiates us from<br />\nanimals and other so-called lower<br />\nspecies. To him, our use of<br />\nlanguage, intelligence, and tools<br />\nare what defines us from the rest<br />\nof the animal kingdom. However,<br />\nCartmill pointed out that scientists<br />\noften manipulate data to get the<br />\nresults that they want. He illustrates this idea with several<br />\npieces of evidence. One such<br />\nmorsel of information deals with<br />\nchimpanzees and their ability to<br />\nuse human sign language. It was<br />\nshown that, given time, chimps<br /><br />\ncould learn and employ sign<br />\nlanguage to communicate with<br />\nhumans. As soon as this was<br />\nachieved, the definition of<br />\nlanguage was changed to the<br />\nability to use the learned words<br />\nto create new and different syntaxes and meanings. In other<br /><br />\nhad the largest brains. Then came<br />\ndolphins and porpoises. Clearly<br />\nthere was extensive manipulations with the data to get the<br />\nresults that the scientists wanted.<br />\nCartmill brings this theory into play with the theory of evolution by believing that \"We must<br /><br />\n\"We mustjustify our unique position in the universe...<br />\nwords, Cartmill sees the<br />\nmanipulation and changes of data<br />\nto be a way in which scientists get<br />\nthe results they want. In the case<br />\nof the chimps, in Cartmill's view,<br />\nthe scientists wanted to keep the<br />\nspecies \"below\" us, and<br />\ntherefore altered the interpretation of the data.<br />\nAnother case that he cited for<br />\nthe manipulation of data involved the basic premise that humans<br />\nhave the largest brains. This is<br />\nnot true if you look at a whale or<br />\nan elephant. Scientists correct this<br />\nlittle problem by stating that for<br />\nour body weight we have the<br />\nlargest brains. Here again lies a<br />\nproblem when you think of a<br />\nmouse or any small animal. The<br />\nproblem was solved by creating<br />\nlogarythm graphs and finally we,<br />\nthe humans on this here earth,<br /><br />\njustify our unique position in the<br />\nuniverse.\" In order to do this, he<br />\nis concerned that scientists and<br />\nother people in the field may<br />\noverlook the obvious truth to<br />\nsimply get the results they want.<br />\nWhether or not Cartmill is<br />\njustified in his claims remains to<br />\nbe seen, as does conclusive<br />\nproof of the so called \"Missing<br />\nLink\". There is a lot to be<br />\ndiscovered about how we<br />\nevolved\u2014not only is the Missing<br />\nLink missing, but \"all the links<br />\nare missing.\"<br />\nThe next lecture of the series<br />\nwill be presented on Wednesday,<br />\nMarch 4, in Mudd Lecture Hall<br />\nat 8 p.m. The topic will be AIDS.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br /><br />\nllopkin8 science in Brief<br />\nMemory<br />\nAnd How It Works<br />\nFamily<br />\nPlanning\u2014That's<br />\nEntertainment!<br /><br />\nHe went on to show that these<br />\ncan be further divided into<br />\n\"How Memory Works: In- declarative and procedural<br />\nsights from the Study of classifications.

Anyone who's been<br />\nfamiliar with the international<br />\nscene for the last decade knows<br />\nthat his credentials are strong as<br />\nthe Rock of Gibraltar.<br />\nFirst off, he was an assistant to<br />\nDean Smith of North Carolina in<br /><br />\nMontreal, when we won in 1976.<br />\nAnd,he also helped in selecting<br />\nthe material for Bobby Knight of<br />\nIndiana in 1984.<br />\nPositives? \"Big Bad John\" is<br />\nloaded. His style of play was<br />\ncreated for the Olympics\u2014coastto-coast pressure on D, and a<br />\ngiddy-up offense, which if it<br />\ndoesn't immediately convert, is<br />\nfollowed by patient patterns.<br /><br />\nCoach John also knows how to<br />\nuse a long bench, which is a<br />\ndefinite asset because of the<br />\nphysical style of international<br />\nplay, and which means that at<br />\nleast 10 of the 12 U.S. Olympians<br />\nwill be sure to get their fair share<br />\nof PT.<br />\nOne other thing: Coach John<br />\nalso has a complete understanding<br />\nof international rules, and he also<br />\nspent time last summer with<br />\nCoach Lute Olsen of Arizona at<br />\nthe World Games in Madrid.<br />\nMake no mistake, he is no<br />\nstranger to the international<br />\nbullring.<br />\nSo, those are all the positives.<br />\nAll the items on the asset side of<br /><br />\nthe ledger. Now,I think, it's time<br />\nwe got on to the list of things on<br />\nthe liability side\u2014things that<br />\nCoach John, or for that matter,<br />\nany Olympic coach, has to deal<br />\nwith this time around.<br />\nFirst off, this is not a summer<br />\nOlympics, but a Games of the<br />\nfall, when the leaves are starting<br />\nto turn. It goes from September<br />\nto October, which creates major<br />\nheadaches for the National<br />\nBasketball Association. How, for<br />\nexample, a senior who was<br />\ndrafted in the spring be watching<br />\nthe sunset on the Yellow Sea at<br />\na time when NBA clubs are<br />\nalready through their training<br />\ncamp and getting ready for their<br />\nseason opener?<br />\nAs if that weren't enough, let's<br />\ntake a look at problem number<br />\ntwo, which concerns the athletes<br />\nwho are still in college. Right<br />\nnow, it looks like they'd be missing at least three weeks of<br />\nclass\u2014which is a no-no\u2014unless<br />\nyou figure to take 'em out for the<br />\nwhole semester. And, believe<br />\nme, that's a no-no to the poor college coach who has recruited the<br />\nkid and has him on his team.<br />\nSo what are the answers?<br />\nWell, I really believe that<br />\nDavid Stern, commissioner of the<br />\nNBA, will do everything he can<br />\nto help solve the problem with the<br />\npros, because in the past the NBA<br />\nhas done more than its fair share<br />\nto make our U.S. Olympic team<br />\nthe best that it can be\u2014both financially, and also by adjusting their<br />\nrules.<br />\nAs far as the college basketball<br />\nplayers are concerned, I think<br /><br />\nwhat you'll see is a reaching into<br />\nand response from the private<br />\nsector to supply a contingent of<br />\n10 to 15 tutors, who would go<br />\nthrough the training and traveling<br />\nwith the Olympic squad that we<br />\nsend to Seoul.<br />\nCoach John, quite naturally, is<br />\nreacting to all this with top hat<br />\nand cane diplomacy.<br />\nThe only comment he'll make<br />\nabout all the problems is that he<br />\nwould like to have three Patrick<br />\nEwings in his selection of a team,<br />\nand that he plans to spend quite<br />\na bit of time this year at the PanAm Games in Indianapolis,<br />\nwhere Denny Crum of Louisville<br />\nis handling the head coaching<br />\nduties. What Coach John hopes to<br />\ndo after is to get a big leg up on<br />\nevaluating the prospective<br />\nballplayers, and get some feeling<br />\non what the desires and commitments of certain players will<br />\nbe, before they start the 1987-88<br />\ncollege season.<br />\nWhat does he need?<br />\nFirst of all, he'll be looking for<br />\nplayers mainly that can play upcourt, who can defense the threepoint shot, and who are mobile as<br />\nwell as physical. Olympic games<br />\nare played in a push-shove, grunt,<br />\nmultiple-foul type style, and you<br />\nmust remember that John will not<br />\nhave the big advantage of '84,<br />\nwhen we were on our own<br />\nblacktop in LaLa Land, which<br />\nmade it super inviting for the<br />\nplayers who wanted to use the<br />\nFive Rings and the Olympic Anthem to open doors and gain exposure into the financial league,<br />\nthe NBA.<br /><br />\nAnother thing to remember:<br />\none of the difficult things, too,<br />\nnow that Coach John has picked<br />\nup the Olympic torch, is that he<br />\nwill have two head coaching jobs.<br />\nHe has to be careful not to put<br />\nin too much time on the Olympics, so that it might adversely affect his Hoyas, or vice-versa.<br />\nAnd, there are the constant<br />\nrumors that the pros want him,<br />\nwhich can be a fatal distraction if<br />\nhe allows it to turn his head too<br />\nsoon.<br />\nPersonally, I believe that<br />\nsomewhere down the line, John's<br />\nworld will be a poltical arena, not<br />\na sports arena. But, time will<br />\ntell. . .
