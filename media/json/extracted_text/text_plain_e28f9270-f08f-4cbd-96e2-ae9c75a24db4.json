However,the fact that<br />\nvery few Johns Hopkins premeds meet the requirements for<br />\n\"well-roundedness\" of Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School does<br />\nsuggest that there is something<br />\nwrong with the undergraduate<br />\nprogram, probably not primarily<br />\nin the pre-med program as such.<br />\nIt has been my experience that<br />\nin most departments here, students are not encouraged to take<br />\na broad general program.<br />\nJohns Hopkins graduates,<br />\nwhether they will eventually<br />\nbecome doctors, lawyers, or<br />\ncollege professors, should not be<br />\nmere technicians, but rather,<br />\neducated people.

My father, distrustful of any institution<br />\nyounger than himself, preferred them to airplanes, and so, by the time I became aware of<br />\njust what it was I was hearing and feeling, the<br />\nstacato clicking and gentle rocking of the<br />\nPulman car seemed as natural and as necessary<br />\nto me as any other sensation of my eight-yearold life. To imagine a world without trains back<br />\nthen would have been inconceivable. Today,it<br />\nis a dismal prospect to me yet. This is difficult<br />\nto explain to my peers, for trains were already<br />\nbeing avoided in droves when I was riding them<br />\nas a boy, and consequently, my friends do not<br />\nunderstand that there is indeed a Glory passing<br />\nfrom the earth.<br />\nA qualification needs to be made before I go<br />\nany further. When I say \"trains,\" I mean just<br />\nthat--honest-to-God, long haul, trans-continental<br />\ntrains--such as The Broadway Limited, The<br />\nCalifornia Zepher and The Empire Builder.<br />\nI most definitely do not mean the sterile sardine.<br />\ncans which will probably carry a good many of<br />\nyou back to the swamps of 'Jersey a few weeks<br />\nhence. Riding on one of those items is railroading's version of taking your sister to the prom,<br />\nfor thanks to the infinite wisdom of Amtrak, it<br />\nis now possible to travel from Boston to Washington in a shiny toothpaste tube. You may sit<br />\nin the French-made Amcoach, stroll to the<br />\nAmcafe, purchase an Am & cheese sandwich,<br />\nand then retire to the Amtoilet to dispose ()fit<br />\nat your convenience. Let me assure you, my<br />\n<br />\nattitude toward the passing of such sorry<br />\nexcuses for rolling stock will be decidedly<br />\nAm-bivalent. The problem is that they aren't so<br />\nmuch trains as half-baked planes with the wings<br />\nripped off. Amtrak claims to have exhumed the<br />\ncorpse of rail passenger service in the Northeast<br />\nCorridor...Very well, but piecing the body back<br />\ntogether in such a cold-blooded, sterile fashion<br />\nhas utterly failed to re-ignite the soul.<br />\nTo get any romance out of riding a train<br />\ntoday, you have to leave the security of megalopolis and venture inland. There, beyond the<br />\nPiedmont's end, the old Titans still rumble<br />\nthrough the night--a little wearily perhaps, and<br />\nwidely spaced to be sure, but going forward all<br />\nthe same. Out there, sentiment still rides the<br />\nrails, but its time is running out.<br />\n* * * * * * * * *** * ** *<br />\nFor me, it was the dull, Midwestern plains<br />\nwhich were first transformed into an everchanging delight through the half-inch medium<br />\nof a train window. My family and I were regular<br />\ncustomers on the Texas Chief betWeen Chicago<br />\nand Oklahoma City, and the twenty-car streamliner seemed to me an entire third city which<br />\nflew gracefully between the other two, propelled<br />\nby some unknown magic. The doors between<br />\nthe coaches were like obstinant slabs of concrete<br />\nto my pushing and tugging, so hard to get open<br />\nthat I knew they must be hiding something<br />\nwonderful in the car ahead. The vestibules, with<br />\ntheir shifting joiner-plates and deafening racket,<br />\nseemed like dangerous precipices whipped by<br />\nwinds and continually crumbling under my<br />\nbuster browns, and I recall peering through the<br />\ncracks at the whistling roadbed beneath with a<br />\nfascinated terror. It was on those nights aboard<br />\nThe Chief, wrapped up in the folds of my<br />\nfather's robe, and watching the Missouri dark-<br />\n<br />\nness race past beneath the frozen stars, than any<br />\nwonder and imagination and philosophy I<br />\npossess must have taken root in me. To look<br />\nout from a train window at night upon the<br />\nrunning shadows of the countryside is to be<br />\nunconnected to the ground, even by the singing<br />\nsteel wheels. No,the express at night, expecially<br />\nif it is a moonlit night, is a world apart, a place<br />\nof private thoughts,- suspended somewhere<br />\nbetween the ground and the heavens.<br />\nI can't help but become attached to-a train<br />\nI've ridden, even once. You see, trains, unlike<br />\nthe aluminum vultures of the air, have personalities of their own. The rolling stock and the<br />\nroute combine to make each one unique, and<br />\nthe monotony which plagues the veteran air<br />\ntraveller seldom bothers his train-going counterpart. The names, or, more appropriately, the<br />\ntitles of each train (for every trip is a poem or<br />\nnovel complete) speak of a long tradition and a<br />\ndistinct home turf: The James Whitcomb<br />\nReilley, The Sunset Limited, The North Coast<br />\nHiawatha.<br />\nNot only the trains, but even the individual<br />\ncoaches themselves have monikers of distinction.<br />\nI remember what a delight it was, in the early<br />\ndays of Amtrak, to walk the length of the train<br />\nand revel in the pot-luck of rolling stock assembled from distant roads. Their names betrayed<br />\nfrom whence they came as easily as their different colors: The Loch Sloy, Loch Aburdeen, and<br />\nYukon Trail from the Great Northern, Painted<br />\nDesert and Ft. Chisolm from the Santa Fe,Palm<br />\nGrove and Santa Maria froam the Seaboard<br />\nCoast Line, Mark Twain from the Illinois Central. Those were very happy and hopeful times<br />\nfor railroad buffs, but they turned out to be<br />\nshort-lived. Those coaches are all the same<br />\ncolor now--Amtrak silver. Their number de:<br />\ncreases steadily month by month, and it has<br />\nbecome painfully clear that the would-be savior<br />\nhas proved a charlatan.<br />\nListen, I could tell you all about why we<br />\nneed passenger trains. I could tell you about<br />\nhow with a million dollars you can build two<br />\nmiles of Interstate highway or fifty of railroad<br />\nright-of-way (taking up one-tenth the space). I<br />\ncould tell you that journeys by train are sixteen<br />\ntimes safter than those by plane and thirty-eight<br />\ntimes safer than taking a car. I could tell you<br />\nthat taking a thousand people out of their cars<br />\nand placing them on a single train would save<br />\n91% of the fuel and 97% of the pollution.

An elevated, steelribbed glass bubble extending the length of a<br />\ncoach, the dome is the holiest of holies for the<br />\nhardened railfan. First of all, it is quiet--being a<br />\ngood fifteen feet above the tracks, there are no<br />\nrail-joints clicking or air brakes hissing. The jolts<br />\nand jumps seem to fade out once you climb the<br />\nstairs, giving way to a smooth ride and an<br />\nunobstructed view. Looking ahead, you can see<br />\nthe silver tops of the coaches as they snake along<br />\nbetween the hills, and watch the signals wink red<br />\nas the engine passes them, still a quarter-mile<br />\nahead. Tree limbs brush the panes and birds<br />\nsoar abreast like porpouses racing a yacht. The<br />\npoetry of railroads is nowhere more apparent<br />\nthan in the vista-dome, for the entire phenomenon can be taken in with a turn of the head,<br />\nand the world seems all before you. I recall one<br />\nnight, sitting alone in the darkened dome and<br />\nwatching a thunderstorm lash the clouds directly<br />\noverhead. The silence, the mystery, and the<br />\nunreality of the place suggested some eerie,<br />\nairborne chapel. To my mind, technology and<br />\nnature never complement each other half so well<br />\nas on a moving train.<br />\nFlying can be romantic too, I suppose, but<br />\nnot the way Americans go about it today.<br />\nTaking the plane is considered by most people<br />\nto be a chore, and the airlines go to no great<br />\nlengths to refute that assumption. There used to<br />\nbe a time when \"getting there was half the fun,\"<br />\nbut American culture killed that with its insistence that speed vincit omnia. Since the train<br />\ntakes longer than the Friendly Skies, Americans<br />\nassume that it will be just a longer chore, a<br />\nlonger inconvenience. What they fail to realize<br />\nis that taking the train is, or at any rate, should<br />\nbe, a totally different experience--and one which<br />\nis not comparable to plane travel in any significant way. It's like masturbating and making<br />\nlove--the physiological result is the same, but ah!<br />\nthe getting there\u2014aye, there's the rub.<br />\nAn example of what I'm talking about<br />\ncomes easily to mind. Once, while airborne<br />\nin one of Braniff's \"pop-art\" jets, a portly,lady<br />\nwho had been stuffed (with no small exertion)<br />\ninto the high-chair next to me,exclaimed,\"Isn't<br />\nit amazing that they can manage to serve\u2022 all<br />\nthese hundreds of meals while we're six miles<br />\nin the air and going almost the speed of sound?\"<br />\n<br />\n'<br />\n<br />\n\"Astounding.\" I replied, looking down at<br />\nmy cube of Soylent ground-round, plastic<br />\ngreen-beans, hermetically sealed roll,and brimming 3 oz. thimble of coca-cola. \"Truly astounding.\" Never mind six miles up, those airline<br />\nmeals look and taste as if they were prepared by<br />\nmutants in lunar orbit. Far more fascinating to<br />\nme than any high-altitude antics are the finelytuned acrobatics which go into turning out a<br />\nfull, four-course meal on the swaying floor of a<br />\ndining car. The bustle is amazing, as waiters<br />\npirouette and heavy pewter plates swing from<br />\nkitchen to table with ne'er a mishap. \"Train<br />\nlegs\" are much akin to \"sea legs,\" in that those<br />\nwho possess them can make the novice feel like<br />\na pitiful spastic just by walking half-a-dozen<br />\ngraceful steps. Amid all the confusion, however,<br />\nthe amenities are not forgotten: carnations in a<br />\nvase, heavy white linen, and all the time you<br />\ncare to take.<br />\nI come 1700 miles to Hopkins each semester, and getting here in under three hours seems<br />\nto minimalize what would otherwise be an<br />\nimpressive distance. Believe it or not, there's<br />\na lot of country between here and Denver, filled<br />\nwith a lot of interesting people\u2014interesting<br />\nprecigely because you see them only for an<br />\ninstant, in a thousand different aspects, framed<br />\nby a moving window.<br />\nIf you want longer acquaintences, a train is<br />\nstill the better place. Jammed three-abreast<br />\ninto airline torture racks, it is difficult to feel<br />\nanything other than resentment toward the<br />\nunfortunate creature whom fate has decided will<br />\nbe your fellow-sufferer for the duration. A<br />\njourney by rail, however, lets vou get to know<br />\nmore about people than the shape of their<br />\nelbow. The club car, unlike its paltry airborne<br />\ncounterpart, does not limit you to two micrococktails, and the atmosphere is indusive to<br />\ninstant cameraderie.<br />\nBy rail, the distance, the enormity of this<br />\ncountry is emphasized, not trivialized. Believe it<br />\nor not, when you get closer to the ground,<br />\nAmerica does not still look like somebody<br />\nspilled the Wheat Thins on the coffee-table. It<br />\nbecomes real--it becomes something to be<br />\nreckoned with. When I stay up 'till 2 a.m. to see<br />\nthe Mississippi, wake up amid the suburbs<br />\nof Chicago, have dinner in Ohio, and the next<br />\nday's breakfast in Pennsylvania dutch country,<br />\nI feel as though I've really gone away to college<br />\ninstead of stepping into some half-assed transporter beam.<br />\n<br />\n*** * ******<br />\n<br />\n* * **<br />\n<br />\nLet's get back to the club car for a minute. t<br />\ndon't know if people who ride long-haul trains<br />\nare just more philosophical than the average<br />\nperson, or whether its the unique setting which<br />\nbrings out the contemplative side. (I suspect the<br />\nlatter.) Whatever the cause, club car conversations are seldom just trivial chit-chat. For some<br />\nreason, people will confide with each other a lot<br />\nmore easily in a club car than would normally be<br />\nthe case. Perhaps it's just the right combination:<br />\na train trip is long enough to give a sense of<br />\nbeing \"fellow-travellers,\" and yet you know that<br />\nif you have another scotch and really spill your<br />\nguts, your embarrassing disclosure won't make<br />\nany difference after you reach your destination.<br />\nAnd love? Well, maybe I've been reading<br />\ntoo much Agatha Christy or Penthouse, but to<br />\nme, every woman on a train has an added bit of<br />\nmystery floating around the folds of her dress<br />\nor curling slowly from her cigarette. \"Is she<br />\ntravelling alone, or sharing a roomette with her<br />\nmother?\" If she's sitting by herself in the diner,<br />\nlooking pensively out the window, I can convince myself that almost any girl looks like<br />\nLauren Bacall.

If any of my fond reminiscing<br />\nhas piqued your interest, you'd better hurry.<br />\nOn October 1, barring an unlikely Congressional<br />\nbail-out, Amtrak will cut its 27,700 mile system<br />\nby 43%.

With<br />\nperformances ranging from Lol Coxhill's<br />\nsolo saxophone to Daevid Allen's Gong<br />\nand the Gong Fest, each concert brought<br />\naccomplished musicians offering something different to the discriminating<br />\nlistener. With a personal love for the<br />\nmusic and close relations with many<br />\nof the musicians, Newman and Steed have<br />\nbeen able to bring leaders in avant-garde<br />\nmusic to Baltimore, thus establishing<br />\nHopkins as the progressive capital of the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\nAlthough the concerts tend to draw a<br />\nlarge off-campus audience, they have<br />\ngiven students an opportunity to be<br />\nexposed to the most experimental music<br />\nin the world today. It is these kinds of<br />\nactivities which open up whole new<br />\nhorizons of art, so imperative to a thriving cultural scene. The Fine Arts Committee, more than any other group on<br />\ncampus, is committed to these ideals. If<br />\nthe concerts next year continue at<br />\nanywhere near the same rate, I can only<br />\nhope that more students will find the<br />\ntime and energy to attend.<br />\nOn a more traditional wavelength,<br />\nWJHU has made FM music a little less<br />\ntraditional. While there are still a number<br />\nof quirks in the system, the simple fact of<br />\nbeing on the air is a tremendous step. Its<br />\nformat is a welcome break from the<br />\nhumdrum of other Baltimore stations,<br />\nmaking WJHU an important radio station<br />\nwith a great future.<br />\nAlways changing in its infancy, the<br />\nlate night slots devoted to 'progressive<br />\nrock' are just what the station needed to<br />\nescape the banality of WLPL and<br />\n98Rock. Don Gordon on Tuesdays and<br />\nNeal Blaxburg on Thursdays play a<br />\nconsistently exciting blend of New Wave<br />\nand more traditional rock, whatever<br />\neither of those terms mean. They are the<br />\nbest WJHU has, although the slot offers<br />\nsomething new and different every night.<br />\nI still can't understand why jazz is<br />\nfrom 6-9 in the mornings, and I think the<br />\nclassical programming should be a little<br />\nmore structured, but WJHU has great<br />\npotential. The newscasts are close to<br />\nprofessional quality, and with some more<br />\non the air training, our station could be<br />\nthe best in Baltimore. Unfortunately,<br />\nnow it only reaches six miles.<br />\n<br />\n88.1 FM<br />\n<br />\nThe performance ten days ago of Stuart Cohen's Downtown marked<br />\nthe end of a long year of exciting, vital and continually expanding cultural<br />\nactivities on the Hopkins campus, a year which included the concerts<br />\npresented by Ken Newman and the Fine Arts Committee; the two issues<br />\nof Zeniada; the advent of FM Radio; the work of Mark Norton and<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office to bring concerts like the Nighthawks, and events<br />\nlike the showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show. These 'happenings,'<br />\nalong with many others, contributed to an arts scene which was very<br />\nmuch alive.<br />\nMy aim as Arts Editor of the News-Letter has been to be as responsive<br />\nas possible to these on-campus developments. Unfortunately, with only<br />\ntwo pages a week and a limited staff, I have been unable to fulfill some of<br />\nthese goals. I would like, now, to redeem myself by calling attention to<br />\nsome of the most important events of the past year. As I move on to<br />\nother things, I think it's important to recognize the important work that<br />\nhas been done and hope that the future will bring even greater success.<br />\n<br />\nA Way To Expand<br />\nThe Humanities<br />\nCheers for Zeniada, a magazine<br />\nwhich has begun to blossom. Dedicated<br />\nto publishing high-quality undergraduate<br />\nexpository and creative works, Zeniada<br />\nresembles The New Republic, Atlantic<br />\nMonthly, and The New Yorker. Hopefully, with forthcoming issues, the resemblance will grow beyond the superficial.<br />\nThe format of the Spring 1979 issue<br />\nis calculated to definitely impress. The<br />\nlettering style on the cover, copied from<br />\nThe New Republic, imparts a professional, established air at first glance. The<br />\nContents page is set in the same type as<br />\nthe Atlantic Monthly's. The Profile<br />\nsection of the magazine, comparable to<br />\nthe New Yorker feature of the same<br />\nname, does not run on interminably.<br />\nZeniada would remain immune from<br />\ncriticism if its contents were of as high<br />\nquality as those of, the magazines it<br />\nimitates. One should be grateful for small<br />\nblessings at Hopkins, though: the closest<br />\nZeniada comes to pornography is the<br />\n<br />\n\"Interview,\" perhaps borrowed from<br />\nPlayboy's feature.<br />\nQuality, always a matter of taste,<br />\nseems uneven in this swing issue. Though<br />\nwell written, some articles are dull. A<br />\npiece on Baltimore which affected<br />\nHopkins lives might be more appropriate<br />\nthan one on death and injury at Sparrows<br />\nPoint, a story which could have been left<br />\nStuart Cohen's<br />\nto the newspapers.<br />\nwritings on the Humanities examined an<br />\nimportant area often ignored and maligned at Hopkins. The very existence of<br />\nZeniada shows an effort by some to<br />\nimprove and expand Hopkins Humanities.<br />\nThe staff of Zeniada would do well<br />\nby diligently avoiding the juvenile when<br />\nselecting fiction and poetry. Two poems<br />\nand one story in this, issue stand out:<br />\nAdam Stern's \"Proteus Crossing,\" Noah<br />\nSchenkman's \"Elegy\" and Daisy Taylor's<br />\n\"Magic.\" A magazine filled with such<br />\nworks would live up to the legacy of the<br />\nancestors it has chosen.<br />\n<br />\nby Danna Eisman<br />\n<br />\nZeniada<br />\n<br />\nJI<br />\n<br />\nTelevision by Lisa Kay Pease<br />\n<br />\nA year with even a single event which<br />\nhas students dancing around and having a<br />\ngood time could be called a 'good' year.<br />\nThis year there were two, and Mark<br />\nNorton had his hand in both of them. As<br />\nthe exceptional co-organizer of Weekend<br />\nWonderflix for the past two years,<br />\nNorton brought Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow to Hopkins for a weekend in<br />\nOctober, along with all the hysteria which<br />\nhas accompanied it around the country.<br />\nLines extended across Shriver Quad, and<br />\nthe costume contest on Saturday night<br />\nbrought out the 'best' in everyone. It was<br />\na show that saw the campus and the<br />\nstudents come alive and out of the<br />\ncloset.<br />\nThe other event, a little more tame,<br />\nwas the Nighthawks concert in March.<br />\nOne of the most popular 'small time'<br />\nbands in the country, they had the<br />\naudience in Shriver dancin' to rhythm<br />\nand blues all night long. The organization<br />\nand execution was highly professional,<br />\nand I can only hope that there will be<br />\nmore concerts like the Nighthawks in the<br />\nfuture. Kudos to Norton for the tremendous work he has done to promote, and I<br />\nmean promote, the arts at Hopkins for<br />\nthe past few years.<br />\nThe creative music scene also thrived<br />\nthis year. Chester's Place continued<br />\nto showcase the best music this area<br />\noffers, and this year Hopkins students<br />\nfinally began to be heard. This has a lot<br />\nto do with the Music Coop organized at<br />\nthe beginning of the year. As a forum for<br />\nmusicians, it brings together people with<br />\nvarious talents and interests, resulting in<br />\nnew campus bands and a vibrant music<br />\nscene.<br />\nNo Mercy, organized last year under<br />\nmany names, has developed into a quality<br />\nband with performances around Baltimore this past winter and spring. Called<br />\n\"Baltimore's hottest new band,\" members of No Mercy have committed themselves to a musical career. But the<br />\npresence of neW bands with members<br />\nsimply \"getting together and making<br />\nmusic\" has been deeply felt. Desperate<br />\nLiving, Airborne and Boah are some of<br />\nthe many which have formed during the<br />\nyear. Through the work of the Coop,<br />\nthere has been a \"rennaissance\" of<br />\nmusical groups and a new musical sensibility among listeners throughout the<br />\ncampus.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER /PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\n4,,<br />\nstit7<br />\n<br />\nRod Stewart Must Die<br />\n<br />\nSo who gives a damn about music<br />\ncriticism?<br />\nWell, I do, for one, but I seem to be<br />\nin the minority around here.<br />\nThink about it for a second: When<br />\nwas the last time you were influenced by<br />\na reviewer to buy a record by an artist<br />\nyou were totally unfamiliar with? The<br />\nsame year the Cubs last won the World<br />\nSeries, I'll bet.<br />\nIt's hard to believe that in England,<br />\ncritics do matter.

To<br />\nreceive free front row tickets and backstage passes to every major concert that<br />\nhits his town? Yeah, that might have<br />\nsomething to do with it, Slim.<br />\nPersonally, though, I get my kicks<br />\nout of stuffing my opinions down<br />\npeoples' throats.

Taking the largest risks and investing the<br />\ngreatest amount of energy and time, Downtown is a crucial event in the upsurge of<br />\nparticipation in and appreciation of the arts at Hopkins. A completely studentorganized and executed production, Downtown, despite its brevity, will hopefully<br />\nhave much greater long-term effects.<br />\nIt would be possible to praise the production techniques highly while criticizing<br />\nthe subject matter, but this would be counterproductive. The most important thing<br />\nabout Downtown is that it happened. The combined student input and interest and<br />\nthe overall audience experience make Downtown an extremely exciting and important<br />\nevent.<br />\nUnfortunately, I have doubts whether it could happen again. The administration<br />\nprobably supported the production simply because there was nothing like it. In the<br />\nfuture, though, instead of allocating funds to new and different projects, powers that<br />\nbe are apt to refuse support, instead directing interested students to already existing<br />\norganizations such as the Student Council and the Barnstormers.<br />\nThe arts at Hopkins certainly need more events like Downtown, where students<br />\nare directly involved in every facet of production. These kinds of activities are generally not promoted and supported by administration and other university-wide bureaucracies.

Coach<br />\nHenry Ciccarone was pleased<br />\nwith the results, saying, \"We<br />\nplayed our best game of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nWith their impressive performance against Navy, the<br />\nunbeaten Jays successfully defended their top position in the<br />\nfinal Coaches' poll, gaining the<br />\nfirst seed for finals, which will<br />\nopen here on Wednesday, May<br />\n16.<br />\nBlue Jay midfielders Scott<br />\nBaugher and Dave Huntley each<br />\ngot hat tricks, with three goals<br />\napiece, while Baugher assisted<br />\nwith an inside pass to fellow<br />\nmiddie Wayne Davis. Davis went<br />\non to score that goal and assist<br />\non another. Face-off man Ned<br />\nRadebaugh, who leads the Jay<br />\nmidfield in ground ball recovery,<br />\npicked up three assists and a<br />\ngoal, and his crucial face-off<br />\ntalent accounted for Jeff Harris's<br />\ngoal 22 seconds into the second<br />\nquarter.<br />\nHarris was the game's attack<br />\nstandout as he pulled in feeds<br />\nfrom Jim Bidne and Steve Wey<br />\nto lead the Blue Jay downfield<br />\nattack with three goals. Freshman Jeff Cook seemed to want<br />\nto fill Mike O'Neill's cleats as he<br />\nleapt through the air to dump<br />\nthe ball over his shoulder, right<br />\npast Navy goalie Jeff Johnson<br />\nfor a goal.<br />\nThe reserve attack also<br />\nconnected when it was inserted<br />\nlate in the game to face reserve<br />\n<br />\ngoalie Justin Pavoni. Barney<br />\nFields and Mike Donnelly added<br />\ngoals to increase their point<br />\ntotals, and midfielder Mike McGee earned his first goal of the<br />\nseason, for Hopkins' last goal of<br />\nthe game.<br />\nDespite many outstanding<br />\nplayers on the attack, the<br />\nspectacular performers of this<br />\nseason have been goalie Mike<br />\nFederico and his right-hand man,<br />\nMark Greenberg. Greenberg and<br />\nFederico, probably First Team<br />\nhave<br />\nchoices,<br />\nAll-America<br />\nclamped down on attackers with<br />\nlightning efficiency. Although<br />\nFederico has occasionally thwarted an entire team of attackers,<br />\nthe real hero of many of this<br />\nyear's contests has been Greenberg, whose sparkling performances have left opponents and<br />\ntheir coaches in total awe all<br />\nseason long. Greenberg's hardhitting man-to-man defensive<br />\ntactics have rendered the scoring<br />\nstars of Division I, Bob Boniello<br />\n(Maryland), Ned Gerber (Cornell), Bato Pelington (UV), and<br />\nMike Buzzell (Navy), virtually<br />\npowerless in their teams' offensive drives.<br />\nWith this kind of talent, the ,<br />\nupcoming Division I playoffs<br />\nshould be exciting and intensely<br />\nplayed.

The<br />\nClub also performed the Liebslieder Walzes (Opus 52), which<br />\nfeatured soloists Patricia Wil-<br /><br />\ncomb and senior Ben Hellstrom.<br />\nThe concert was conducted<br />\nand orchestrated by Hugh Wolff,<br />\nwho joined the Club this season.<br />\nMr. Wolff, a graduate of Harvard<br />\nUniversity and the Peabody<br />\nConservatory, holds master of<br />\nMusic degrees in piano and in<br />\norchestra conducting, and is<br />\npresently the conductor of the<br />\nPeabody Preparatory Orchestra<br />\nand the assistant conductor<br />\nI of the Annapolis Symphony.

Although<br />\nI have no wish to interfere in<br />\nthis dispute between the stuAdmissions<br />\ndents and the<br />\nlike to<br />\nwould<br />\nI<br />\nttee,<br />\nCommi<br />\ncomment on it. Surely, the fact<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool gives no special preference, as these pre-meds ask for,<br />\nis an indication not of how bad<br />\nthe pre-med program is here, but<br />\nrather of how good the Medical<br />\nSchool is. However,the fact that<br />\nvery few Johns Hopkins premeds meet the requirements for<br />\n\"well-roundedness\" of Johns<br />\nHopkins Medical School does<br />\nsuggest that there is something<br />\nwrong with the undergraduate<br />\nprogram, probably not primarily<br />\nin the pre-med program as such.<br />\nIt has been my experience that<br />\nin most departments here, students are not encouraged to take<br />\na broad general program.<br />\nJohns Hopkins graduates,<br />\nwhether they will eventually<br />\nbecome doctors, lawyers, or<br />\ncollege professors, should not be<br />\nmere technicians, but rather,<br />\neducated people. Most freshmen<br />\nat Hopkins do not have the<br />\nbackground in history, literature, etc. that students entering<br />\nEuropean universities have.

My father, distrustful of any institution<br />\nyounger than himself, preferred them to airplanes, and so, by the time I became aware of<br />\njust what it was I was hearing and feeling, the<br />\nstacato clicking and gentle rocking of the<br />\nPulman car seemed as natural and as necessary<br />\nto me as any other sensation of my eight-yearold life. To imagine a world without trains back<br />\nthen would have been inconceivable. Today,it<br />\nis a dismal prospect to me yet. This is difficult<br />\nto explain to my peers, for trains were already<br />\nbeing avoided in droves when I was riding them<br />\nas a boy, and consequently, my friends do not<br />\nunderstand that there is indeed a Glory passing<br />\nfrom the earth.<br />\nA qualification needs to be made before I go<br />\nany further. When I say \"trains,\" I mean just<br />\nthat--honest-to-God, long haul, trans-continental<br />\ntrains--such as The Broadway Limited, The<br />\nCalifornia Zepher and The Empire Builder.<br />\nI most definitely do not mean the sterile sardine.<br />\ncans which will probably carry a good many of<br />\nyou back to the swamps of 'Jersey a few weeks<br />\nhence. Riding on one of those items is railroading's version of taking your sister to the prom,<br />\nfor thanks to the infinite wisdom of Amtrak, it<br />\nis now possible to travel from Boston to Washington in a shiny toothpaste tube. You may sit<br />\nin the French-made Amcoach, stroll to the<br />\nAmcafe, purchase an Am &amp; cheese sandwich,<br />\nand then retire to the Amtoilet to dispose ()fit<br />\nat your convenience. Let me assure you, my<br /><br />\nattitude toward the passing of such sorry<br />\nexcuses for rolling stock will be decidedly<br />\nAm-bivalent. The problem is that they aren't so<br />\nmuch trains as half-baked planes with the wings<br />\nripped off. Amtrak claims to have exhumed the<br />\ncorpse of rail passenger service in the Northeast<br />\nCorridor...Very well, but piecing the body back<br />\ntogether in such a cold-blooded, sterile fashion<br />\nhas utterly failed to re-ignite the soul.<br />\nTo get any romance out of riding a train<br />\ntoday, you have to leave the security of megalopolis and venture inland. There, beyond the<br />\nPiedmont's end, the old Titans still rumble<br />\nthrough the night--a little wearily perhaps, and<br />\nwidely spaced to be sure, but going forward all<br />\nthe same. Out there, sentiment still rides the<br />\nrails, but its time is running out.<br />\n* * * * * * * * *** * ** *<br />\nFor me, it was the dull, Midwestern plains<br />\nwhich were first transformed into an everchanging delight through the half-inch medium<br />\nof a train window. My family and I were regular<br />\ncustomers on the Texas Chief betWeen Chicago<br />\nand Oklahoma City, and the twenty-car streamliner seemed to me an entire third city which<br />\nflew gracefully between the other two, propelled<br />\nby some unknown magic. The doors between<br />\nthe coaches were like obstinant slabs of concrete<br />\nto my pushing and tugging, so hard to get open<br />\nthat I knew they must be hiding something<br />\nwonderful in the car ahead. The vestibules, with<br />\ntheir shifting joiner-plates and deafening racket,<br />\nseemed like dangerous precipices whipped by<br />\nwinds and continually crumbling under my<br />\nbuster browns, and I recall peering through the<br />\ncracks at the whistling roadbed beneath with a<br />\nfascinated terror. It was on those nights aboard<br />\nThe Chief, wrapped up in the folds of my<br />\nfather's robe, and watching the Missouri dark-<br /><br />\nness race past beneath the frozen stars, than any<br />\nwonder and imagination and philosophy I<br />\npossess must have taken root in me. To look<br />\nout from a train window at night upon the<br />\nrunning shadows of the countryside is to be<br />\nunconnected to the ground, even by the singing<br />\nsteel wheels. No,the express at night, expecially<br />\nif it is a moonlit night, is a world apart, a place<br />\nof private thoughts,- suspended somewhere<br />\nbetween the ground and the heavens.<br />\nI can't help but become attached to-a train<br />\nI've ridden, even once. You see, trains, unlike<br />\nthe aluminum vultures of the air, have personalities of their own. The rolling stock and the<br />\nroute combine to make each one unique, and<br />\nthe monotony which plagues the veteran air<br />\ntraveller seldom bothers his train-going counterpart. The names, or, more appropriately, the<br />\ntitles of each train (for every trip is a poem or<br />\nnovel complete) speak of a long tradition and a<br />\ndistinct home turf: The James Whitcomb<br />\nReilley, The Sunset Limited, The North Coast<br />\nHiawatha.<br />\nNot only the trains, but even the individual<br />\ncoaches themselves have monikers of distinction.<br />\nI remember what a delight it was, in the early<br />\ndays of Amtrak, to walk the length of the train<br />\nand revel in the pot-luck of rolling stock assembled from distant roads. Their names betrayed<br />\nfrom whence they came as easily as their different colors: The Loch Sloy, Loch Aburdeen, and<br />\nYukon Trail from the Great Northern, Painted<br />\nDesert and Ft. Chisolm from the Santa Fe,Palm<br />\nGrove and Santa Maria froam the Seaboard<br />\nCoast Line, Mark Twain from the Illinois Central. Those were very happy and hopeful times<br />\nfor railroad buffs, but they turned out to be<br />\nshort-lived. Those coaches are all the same<br />\ncolor now--Amtrak silver. Their number de:<br />\ncreases steadily month by month, and it has<br />\nbecome painfully clear that the would-be savior<br />\nhas proved a charlatan.<br />\nListen, I could tell you all about why we<br />\nneed passenger trains. I could tell you about<br />\nhow with a million dollars you can build two<br />\nmiles of Interstate highway or fifty of railroad<br />\nright-of-way (taking up one-tenth the space). I<br />\ncould tell you that journeys by train are sixteen<br />\ntimes safter than those by plane and thirty-eight<br />\ntimes safer than taking a car. I could tell you<br />\nthat taking a thousand people out of their cars<br />\nand placing them on a single train would save<br />\n91% of the fuel and 97% of the pollution. I<br />\ncould quote facts and figures until I was well<br />\ninto the sports section--but if you think I'll<br />\nmourn more for the economic than the emo-<br /><br />\ntion<br />\nfina<br />\nly.<br /><br />\nthe<br />\nrem<br />\nribb<br />\ncoa(<br />\nharc<br />\ngooi<br />\nrailand<br />\nstair<br />\nuno<br />\nthe<br />\nbet%<br />\nas t<br />\nahe<br />\nsoar<br />\npoei<br />\nthar<br />\nenoi<br />\nand<br />\nnigh<br />\nwatc<br />\nover<br />\nunr\u20ac<br />\nairbl<br />\nnatu<br />\nas oi<br />\n\u2022<br />\nnot<br />\nTaki<br />\nto<br />\nleng<br />\nbe a<br />\nbut<br />\ntenc<br />\ntake<br />\nassui<br />\nlong<br />\nis th<br />\nbe,<br />\nis n(<br />\ncant<br />\nlovethe A<br /><br />\ncom,<br />\nin o<br />\nwho<br />\ninto<br />\nit al<br />\nthes4<br />\nin if<br /><br />\ntional loss when the last train pulls out on its<br />\nfinal run, you haven't been reading very carefully.<br />\n*<br />\n* * * * ** * * * * * * *<br />\nIf the passenger train is a world apart, then<br />\nthe vista-dome can is surely at one higher<br />\nremove from dull reality. An elevated, steelribbed glass bubble extending the length of a<br />\ncoach, the dome is the holiest of holies for the<br />\nhardened railfan. First of all, it is quiet--being a<br />\ngood fifteen feet above the tracks, there are no<br />\nrail-joints clicking or air brakes hissing. The jolts<br />\nand jumps seem to fade out once you climb the<br />\nstairs, giving way to a smooth ride and an<br />\nunobstructed view. Looking ahead, you can see<br />\nthe silver tops of the coaches as they snake along<br />\nbetween the hills, and watch the signals wink red<br />\nas the engine passes them, still a quarter-mile<br />\nahead. Tree limbs brush the panes and birds<br />\nsoar abreast like porpouses racing a yacht. The<br />\npoetry of railroads is nowhere more apparent<br />\nthan in the vista-dome, for the entire phenomenon can be taken in with a turn of the head,<br />\nand the world seems all before you. I recall one<br />\nnight, sitting alone in the darkened dome and<br />\nwatching a thunderstorm lash the clouds directly<br />\noverhead. The silence, the mystery, and the<br />\nunreality of the place suggested some eerie,<br />\nairborne chapel. To my mind, technology and<br />\nnature never complement each other half so well<br />\nas on a moving train.<br />\nFlying can be romantic too, I suppose, but<br />\nnot the way Americans go about it today.<br />\nTaking the plane is considered by most people<br />\nto be a chore, and the airlines go to no great<br />\nlengths to refute that assumption. There used to<br />\nbe a time when \"getting there was half the fun,\"<br />\nbut American culture killed that with its insistence that speed vincit omnia. Since the train<br />\ntakes longer than the Friendly Skies, Americans<br />\nassume that it will be just a longer chore, a<br />\nlonger inconvenience. What they fail to realize<br />\nis that taking the train is, or at any rate, should<br />\nbe, a totally different experience--and one which<br />\nis not comparable to plane travel in any significant way. It's like masturbating and making<br />\nlove--the physiological result is the same, but ah!<br />\nthe getting there\u2014aye, there's the rub.<br />\nAn example of what I'm talking about<br />\ncomes easily to mind. Once, while airborne<br />\nin one of Braniff's \"pop-art\" jets, a portly,lady<br />\nwho had been stuffed (with no small exertion)<br />\ninto the high-chair next to me,exclaimed,\"Isn't<br />\nit amazing that they can manage to serve\u2022 all<br />\nthese hundreds of meals while we're six miles<br />\nin the air and going almost the speed of sound?\"<br /><br />\n'<br /><br />\n\"Astounding.\" I replied, looking down at<br />\nmy cube of Soylent ground-round, plastic<br />\ngreen-beans, hermetically sealed roll,and brimming 3 oz. thimble of coca-cola. \"Truly astounding.\" Never mind six miles up, those airline<br />\nmeals look and taste as if they were prepared by<br />\nmutants in lunar orbit. Far more fascinating to<br />\nme than any high-altitude antics are the finelytuned acrobatics which go into turning out a<br />\nfull, four-course meal on the swaying floor of a<br />\ndining car. The bustle is amazing, as waiters<br />\npirouette and heavy pewter plates swing from<br />\nkitchen to table with ne'er a mishap. \"Train<br />\nlegs\" are much akin to \"sea legs,\" in that those<br />\nwho possess them can make the novice feel like<br />\na pitiful spastic just by walking half-a-dozen<br />\ngraceful steps. Amid all the confusion, however,<br />\nthe amenities are not forgotten: carnations in a<br />\nvase, heavy white linen, and all the time you<br />\ncare to take.<br />\nI come 1700 miles to Hopkins each semester, and getting here in under three hours seems<br />\nto minimalize what would otherwise be an<br />\nimpressive distance. Believe it or not, there's<br />\na lot of country between here and Denver, filled<br />\nwith a lot of interesting people\u2014interesting<br />\nprecigely because you see them only for an<br />\ninstant, in a thousand different aspects, framed<br />\nby a moving window.<br />\nIf you want longer acquaintences, a train is<br />\nstill the better place. Jammed three-abreast<br />\ninto airline torture racks, it is difficult to feel<br />\nanything other than resentment toward the<br />\nunfortunate creature whom fate has decided will<br />\nbe your fellow-sufferer for the duration. A<br />\njourney by rail, however, lets vou get to know<br />\nmore about people than the shape of their<br />\nelbow. The club car, unlike its paltry airborne<br />\ncounterpart, does not limit you to two micrococktails, and the atmosphere is indusive to<br />\ninstant cameraderie.<br />\nBy rail, the distance, the enormity of this<br />\ncountry is emphasized, not trivialized. Believe it<br />\nor not, when you get closer to the ground,<br />\nAmerica does not still look like somebody<br />\nspilled the Wheat Thins on the coffee-table. It<br />\nbecomes real--it becomes something to be<br />\nreckoned with. When I stay up 'till 2 a.m. to see<br />\nthe Mississippi, wake up amid the suburbs<br />\nof Chicago, have dinner in Ohio, and the next<br />\nday's breakfast in Pennsylvania dutch country,<br />\nI feel as though I've really gone away to college<br />\ninstead of stepping into some half-assed transporter beam.<br /><br />\n*** * ******<br /><br />\n* * **<br /><br />\nLet's get back to the club car for a minute. t<br />\ndon't know if people who ride long-haul trains<br />\nare just more philosophical than the average<br />\nperson, or whether its the unique setting which<br />\nbrings out the contemplative side. (I suspect the<br />\nlatter.) Whatever the cause, club car conversations are seldom just trivial chit-chat. For some<br />\nreason, people will confide with each other a lot<br />\nmore easily in a club car than would normally be<br />\nthe case. Perhaps it's just the right combination:<br />\na train trip is long enough to give a sense of<br />\nbeing \"fellow-travellers,\" and yet you know that<br />\nif you have another scotch and really spill your<br />\nguts, your embarrassing disclosure won't make<br />\nany difference after you reach your destination.<br />\nAnd love? Well, maybe I've been reading<br />\ntoo much Agatha Christy or Penthouse, but to<br />\nme, every woman on a train has an added bit of<br />\nmystery floating around the folds of her dress<br />\nor curling slowly from her cigarette. \"Is she<br />\ntravelling alone, or sharing a roomette with her<br />\nmother?\" If she's sitting by herself in the diner,<br />\nlooking pensively out the window, I can convince myself that almost any girl looks like<br />\nLauren Bacall. Ah, to be two trains passing in<br />\nthe night! Don't laugh--there are benefits to rail<br />\ntransportation which the Amtrak brochures fail<br />\nto mention.<br />\nOh yes\u2014Amtrak. I got so carried away I'd<br />\nalmost forgotten. If any of my fond reminiscing<br />\nhas piqued your interest, you'd better hurry.<br />\nOn October 1, barring an unlikely Congressional<br />\nbail-out, Amtrak will cut its 27,700 mile system<br />\nby 43%. Like the German commander told his<br />\ntroops as they fell back to Berlin,\"This is only a<br />\nstrategic withdrawal!\" Don't believe it for a<br />\nminute--the death-throws of the Great Trains<br />\nhave begun. Of course,the Northeast Am-clones<br />\nwill remain, The California Zephyr, The Southern Crescent, and several other venerable old<br />\nsoldiers will not. They will die to make the<br />\nworld safe for Disco, Drive-In McDonalds, and<br />\nthe Highway Trust Fund. Sterility has won<br />\nyet another battle over sentiment, and one<br />\nwhich cannot be justified on any economic<br />\ngrounds.<br />\nThese days we have few enough direct links<br />\nwith our heritage...with things and experiences<br />\nwhich are both distinctly American and yet<br />\nunspoiled by Madison Avenue.

With<br />\nperformances ranging from Lol Coxhill's<br />\nsolo saxophone to Daevid Allen's Gong<br />\nand the Gong Fest, each concert brought<br />\naccomplished musicians offering something different to the discriminating<br />\nlistener. With a personal love for the<br />\nmusic and close relations with many<br />\nof the musicians, Newman and Steed have<br />\nbeen able to bring leaders in avant-garde<br />\nmusic to Baltimore, thus establishing<br />\nHopkins as the progressive capital of the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\nAlthough the concerts tend to draw a<br />\nlarge off-campus audience, they have<br />\ngiven students an opportunity to be<br />\nexposed to the most experimental music<br />\nin the world today. It is these kinds of<br />\nactivities which open up whole new<br />\nhorizons of art, so imperative to a thriving cultural scene. The Fine Arts Committee, more than any other group on<br />\ncampus, is committed to these ideals. If<br />\nthe concerts next year continue at<br />\nanywhere near the same rate, I can only<br />\nhope that more students will find the<br />\ntime and energy to attend.<br />\nOn a more traditional wavelength,<br />\nWJHU has made FM music a little less<br />\ntraditional. While there are still a number<br />\nof quirks in the system, the simple fact of<br />\nbeing on the air is a tremendous step. Its<br />\nformat is a welcome break from the<br />\nhumdrum of other Baltimore stations,<br />\nmaking WJHU an important radio station<br />\nwith a great future.<br />\nAlways changing in its infancy, the<br />\nlate night slots devoted to 'progressive<br />\nrock' are just what the station needed to<br />\nescape the banality of WLPL and<br />\n98Rock. Don Gordon on Tuesdays and<br />\nNeal Blaxburg on Thursdays play a<br />\nconsistently exciting blend of New Wave<br />\nand more traditional rock, whatever<br />\neither of those terms mean. They are the<br />\nbest WJHU has, although the slot offers<br />\nsomething new and different every night.<br />\nI still can't understand why jazz is<br />\nfrom 6-9 in the mornings, and I think the<br />\nclassical programming should be a little<br />\nmore structured, but WJHU has great<br />\npotential. The newscasts are close to<br />\nprofessional quality, and with some more<br />\non the air training, our station could be<br />\nthe best in Baltimore. Unfortunately,<br />\nnow it only reaches six miles.<br /><br />\n88.1 FM<br /><br />\nThe performance ten days ago of Stuart Cohen's Downtown marked<br />\nthe end of a long year of exciting, vital and continually expanding cultural<br />\nactivities on the Hopkins campus, a year which included the concerts<br />\npresented by Ken Newman and the Fine Arts Committee; the two issues<br />\nof Zeniada; the advent of FM Radio; the work of Mark Norton and<br />\nthe Chaplain's Office to bring concerts like the Nighthawks, and events<br />\nlike the showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show. These 'happenings,'<br />\nalong with many others, contributed to an arts scene which was very<br />\nmuch alive.<br />\nMy aim as Arts Editor of the News-Letter has been to be as responsive<br />\nas possible to these on-campus developments. Unfortunately, with only<br />\ntwo pages a week and a limited staff, I have been unable to fulfill some of<br />\nthese goals. I would like, now, to redeem myself by calling attention to<br />\nsome of the most important events of the past year. As I move on to<br />\nother things, I think it's important to recognize the important work that<br />\nhas been done and hope that the future will bring even greater success.<br /><br />\nA Way To Expand<br />\nThe Humanities<br />\nCheers for Zeniada, a magazine<br />\nwhich has begun to blossom. Dedicated<br />\nto publishing high-quality undergraduate<br />\nexpository and creative works, Zeniada<br />\nresembles The New Republic, Atlantic<br />\nMonthly, and The New Yorker. Hopefully, with forthcoming issues, the resemblance will grow beyond the superficial.<br />\nThe format of the Spring 1979 issue<br />\nis calculated to definitely impress. The<br />\nlettering style on the cover, copied from<br />\nThe New Republic, imparts a professional, established air at first glance. The<br />\nContents page is set in the same type as<br />\nthe Atlantic Monthly's. The Profile<br />\nsection of the magazine, comparable to<br />\nthe New Yorker feature of the same<br />\nname, does not run on interminably.<br />\nZeniada would remain immune from<br />\ncriticism if its contents were of as high<br />\nquality as those of, the magazines it<br />\nimitates. One should be grateful for small<br />\nblessings at Hopkins, though: the closest<br />\nZeniada comes to pornography is the<br /><br />\n\"Interview,\" perhaps borrowed from<br />\nPlayboy's feature.<br />\nQuality, always a matter of taste,<br />\nseems uneven in this swing issue. Though<br />\nwell written, some articles are dull. A<br />\npiece on Baltimore which affected<br />\nHopkins lives might be more appropriate<br />\nthan one on death and injury at Sparrows<br />\nPoint, a story which could have been left<br />\nStuart Cohen's<br />\nto the newspapers.<br />\nwritings on the Humanities examined an<br />\nimportant area often ignored and maligned at Hopkins. The very existence of<br />\nZeniada shows an effort by some to<br />\nimprove and expand Hopkins Humanities.<br />\nThe staff of Zeniada would do well<br />\nby diligently avoiding the juvenile when<br />\nselecting fiction and poetry. Two poems<br />\nand one story in this, issue stand out:<br />\nAdam Stern's \"Proteus Crossing,\" Noah<br />\nSchenkman's \"Elegy\" and Daisy Taylor's<br />\n\"Magic.\" A magazine filled with such<br />\nworks would live up to the legacy of the<br />\nancestors it has chosen.<br /><br />\nby Danna Eisman<br /><br />\nZeniada<br /><br />\nJI<br /><br />\nTelevision by Lisa Kay Pease<br /><br />\nA year with even a single event which<br />\nhas students dancing around and having a<br />\ngood time could be called a 'good' year.<br />\nThis year there were two, and Mark<br />\nNorton had his hand in both of them. As<br />\nthe exceptional co-organizer of Weekend<br />\nWonderflix for the past two years,<br />\nNorton brought Rocky Horror Picture<br />\nShow to Hopkins for a weekend in<br />\nOctober, along with all the hysteria which<br />\nhas accompanied it around the country.<br />\nLines extended across Shriver Quad, and<br />\nthe costume contest on Saturday night<br />\nbrought out the 'best' in everyone. It was<br />\na show that saw the campus and the<br />\nstudents come alive and out of the<br />\ncloset.<br />\nThe other event, a little more tame,<br />\nwas the Nighthawks concert in March.<br />\nOne of the most popular 'small time'<br />\nbands in the country, they had the<br />\naudience in Shriver dancin' to rhythm<br />\nand blues all night long. The organization<br />\nand execution was highly professional,<br />\nand I can only hope that there will be<br />\nmore concerts like the Nighthawks in the<br />\nfuture. Kudos to Norton for the tremendous work he has done to promote, and I<br />\nmean promote, the arts at Hopkins for<br />\nthe past few years.<br />\nThe creative music scene also thrived<br />\nthis year. Chester's Place continued<br />\nto showcase the best music this area<br />\noffers, and this year Hopkins students<br />\nfinally began to be heard. This has a lot<br />\nto do with the Music Coop organized at<br />\nthe beginning of the year. As a forum for<br />\nmusicians, it brings together people with<br />\nvarious talents and interests, resulting in<br />\nnew campus bands and a vibrant music<br />\nscene.<br />\nNo Mercy, organized last year under<br />\nmany names, has developed into a quality<br />\nband with performances around Baltimore this past winter and spring. Called<br />\n\"Baltimore's hottest new band,\" members of No Mercy have committed themselves to a musical career. But the<br />\npresence of neW bands with members<br />\nsimply \"getting together and making<br />\nmusic\" has been deeply felt. Desperate<br />\nLiving, Airborne and Boah are some of<br />\nthe many which have formed during the<br />\nyear. Through the work of the Coop,<br />\nthere has been a \"rennaissance\" of<br />\nmusical groups and a new musical sensibility among listeners throughout the<br />\ncampus.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER /PAGE 15<br /><br />\n4,,<br />\nstit7<br /><br />\nRod Stewart Must Die<br /><br />\nSo who gives a damn about music<br />\ncriticism?<br />\nWell, I do, for one, but I seem to be<br />\nin the minority around here.<br />\nThink about it for a second: When<br />\nwas the last time you were influenced by<br />\na reviewer to buy a record by an artist<br />\nyou were totally unfamiliar with?

These kinds of activities are generally not promoted and supported by administration and other university-wide bureaucracies.

Coach<br />\nHenry Ciccarone was pleased<br />\nwith the results, saying, \"We<br />\nplayed our best game of the<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nWith their impressive performance against Navy, the<br />\nunbeaten Jays successfully defended their top position in the<br />\nfinal Coaches' poll, gaining the<br />\nfirst seed for finals, which will<br />\nopen here on Wednesday, May<br />\n16.<br />\nBlue Jay midfielders Scott<br />\nBaugher and Dave Huntley each<br />\ngot hat tricks, with three goals<br />\napiece, while Baugher assisted<br />\nwith an inside pass to fellow<br />\nmiddie Wayne Davis.

Face-off man Ned<br />\nRadebaugh, who leads the Jay<br />\nmidfield in ground ball recovery,<br />\npicked up three assists and a<br />\ngoal, and his crucial face-off<br />\ntalent accounted for Jeff Harris's<br />\ngoal 22 seconds into the second<br />\nquarter.<br />\nHarris was the game's attack<br />\nstandout as he pulled in feeds<br />\nfrom Jim Bidne and Steve Wey<br />\nto lead the Blue Jay downfield<br />\nattack with three goals.

The Quizmaster and the<br />\nBlue Ribbon Panel will evaluate your captions, on a scoring<br />\nbasis of one to ten (one bites the grandest waz, ten is tops).<br />\nA perfect score would be 40, get it?
