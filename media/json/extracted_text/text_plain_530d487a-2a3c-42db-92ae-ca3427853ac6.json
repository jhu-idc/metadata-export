October<br />\nnumber of Tyler's Historical and Genealogical Magazine delves<br />\ninto the origin and early history of the Honor System in American colleges. After tracing its growth at William and Mary<br />\nCollege and at the University of Virginia, the article goes on to<br />\ndeplore the fact that with the introduction of the system into<br />\nthe larger colleges, the attempt to enforce the Honor System<br />\nhave caused it to lose many of the connotations which originally<br />\nadhered to it. The article concludes by saying: \"Honor may<br />\nattend this new system, but it is not an essential part of it. Under<br />\nit the student may be likened to a cog in a machine, and it may<br />\nbe more truly termed 'A Student Machine System' than 'A Student<br />\nHonor System'.\"<br />\nThis explanation hits the nail on the head. The sole reason<br />\nwhy the Honor System has succeeded so phenomenally at Johns<br />\nHopkins, while it has had to be abandoned at so many other<br />\ncolleges, is that here the enforcement of the system's implications<br />\nis actually left to the honor of the individual students, and to their<br />\nhonor alone. The Honor System at this college is.an Honor System in all the fullness of the term. Each student (and we may<br />\nsafely say that there are very few exceptions) feels the personal<br />\nincumbency to fall in line with the one genuine tradition which<br />\nthis University cherishes. The same idea that inspired the birth<br />\nof the system at William and Mary in 1779 keeps it alive at Johns<br />\nHopkins in 1927.<br />\n<br />\nOne may safely say that there was never such a football game<br />\nas the recent scuffle between Hopkins and Loyola. The brand of<br />\nfootball, I am told by connoisseurs, did not compare with that<br />\nseen in the Stadium on the previous Saturday, but who cares for<br />\ngood football, anyway? Perhaps, from the players' point of view,<br />\na more satisfactory victory would have resulted from playing<br />\nconsistently dull to the onlookers; if any method other than passing had been of the slightest avail, the team would have been gratified, Dr. Van Orman mollified and the spectators stupefied. And<br />\nwhat a note on which to close!

October<br />\nnumber of Tyler's Historical and Genealogical Magazine delves<br />\ninto the origin and early history of the Honor System in American colleges. After tracing its growth at William and Mary<br />\nCollege and at the University of Virginia, the article goes on to<br />\ndeplore the fact that with the introduction of the system into<br />\nthe larger colleges, the attempt to enforce the Honor System<br />\nhave caused it to lose many of the connotations which originally<br />\nadhered to it. The article concludes by saying: \"Honor may<br />\nattend this new system, but it is not an essential part of it. Under<br />\nit the student may be likened to a cog in a machine, and it may<br />\nbe more truly termed 'A Student Machine System' than 'A Student<br />\nHonor System'.\"<br />\nThis explanation hits the nail on the head. The sole reason<br />\nwhy the Honor System has succeeded so phenomenally at Johns<br />\nHopkins, while it has had to be abandoned at so many other<br />\ncolleges, is that here the enforcement of the system's implications<br />\nis actually left to the honor of the individual students, and to their<br />\nhonor alone. The Honor System at this college is.an Honor System in all the fullness of the term. Each student (and we may<br />\nsafely say that there are very few exceptions) feels the personal<br />\nincumbency to fall in line with the one genuine tradition which<br />\nthis University cherishes. The same idea that inspired the birth<br />\nof the system at William and Mary in 1779 keeps it alive at Johns<br />\nHopkins in 1927.<br /><br />\nOne may safely say that there was never such a football game<br />\nas the recent scuffle between Hopkins and Loyola. The brand of<br />\nfootball, I am told by connoisseurs, did not compare with that<br />\nseen in the Stadium on the previous Saturday, but who cares for<br />\ngood football, anyway? Perhaps, from the players' point of view,<br />\na more satisfactory victory would have resulted from playing<br />\nconsistently dull to the onlookers; if any method other than passing had been of the slightest avail, the team would have been gratified, Dr. Van Orman mollified and the spectators stupefied. And<br />\nwhat a note on which to close!
