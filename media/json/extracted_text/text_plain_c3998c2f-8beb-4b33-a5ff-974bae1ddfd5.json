During the<br />\ncourse of the evening (9-11 P. M.)<br />\na number of Hopkins yells and<br />\nsongs were given, to which no objection was expressed by the<br />\nmanagement. However, at 11<br />\no'clock, or there about, Mr.<br />\nCharles E. Whitehurst, one of the<br />\nproprietors, accompanied by a<br />\nnumber of policemen, came over<br />\nto the table at which most of the<br />\nHopkins men ,ere seated and<br />\nproceeded to tell the boys with<br />\nthe minimum of Politeness and<br />\nthe maximum of profanity that if<br />\nthey could not \"shut up they<br />\ncould get out\" and he would furnish some assistance in that direction.<br />\nAll noise stopped and there<br />\nwas no further objection raised<br />\nto our deportment during the remainder of the evening. But<br />\nevery Hopkins man felt very<br />\nkeenly with a high degree of in-<br />\n<br />\ndignation the uncalled for manner and methods of Mr. Whitehurst.<br />\nBefore leaving the Roof I made<br />\nit a point to see Mr. Whitehurst<br />\nand explain to him that his action<br />\nwas greatly resentea i?y all the<br />\nHopkins men. To this he argued<br />\nin his characteristic profane language, which was undoubtedly<br />\nemphatic, that he did not want<br />\nany Hopkins men up on the Century Roof! He made it clear that<br />\nhe did not need the money resulting from Hopkins patronage, and<br />\nthat he did not want it.<br />\nTo quote Mr. Whitehurst exactly would not furnish fit material for printing in our esteemed<br />\npublication, but I trust that Hopkins students, graduates and<br />\nfriends will comply with his very<br />\nearnest request and leave the<br />\nCentury Roof for the class of people to which he prefers to cater.<br />\nThat the patrons of the Roof<br />\ndid not object to the cheers or behavior of the Hopkins men is evidenced by the fact that the actions of Mr. Whitehurst in summoning the policemen was soundly hissed by the audience.<br />\nTruly yours,<br />\nDaniel E.

As there are unfortunately no other universities in Hawaii, intercollegiate football necessitated the importation of a team<br />\nfrom the mainland. The Universities of Oregon and Nevada kindly<br />\nobliged, and this year Pomona,<br />\nCalifornia, will try its luck with the<br />\nnew university.<br />\nBut football is not everything<br />\nin this world. Hawaii University<br />\nthis year has begun the issue of a<br />\ncollege paper, which will compare<br />\nfavorably with almost any similar<br />\npublication on the mainland. In<br />\nthe first issue is a most interesting<br />\narticle on Professor Richard Wrenshall, who is working on a specific for leprosy, and the international difficulties which are retarding its development.<br />\nPerhaps American college papers<br />\nwould be most interested in two<br />\nletters, one from W.

During the<br />\ncourse of the evening (9-11 P. M.)<br />\na number of Hopkins yells and<br />\nsongs were given, to which no objection was expressed by the<br />\nmanagement. However, at 11<br />\no'clock, or there about, Mr.<br />\nCharles E. Whitehurst, one of the<br />\nproprietors, accompanied by a<br />\nnumber of policemen, came over<br />\nto the table at which most of the<br />\nHopkins men ,ere seated and<br />\nproceeded to tell the boys with<br />\nthe minimum of Politeness and<br />\nthe maximum of profanity that if<br />\nthey could not \"shut up they<br />\ncould get out\" and he would furnish some assistance in that direction.<br />\nAll noise stopped and there<br />\nwas no further objection raised<br />\nto our deportment during the remainder of the evening. But<br />\nevery Hopkins man felt very<br />\nkeenly with a high degree of in-<br /><br />\ndignation the uncalled for manner and methods of Mr. Whitehurst.<br />\nBefore leaving the Roof I made<br />\nit a point to see Mr. Whitehurst<br />\nand explain to him that his action<br />\nwas greatly resentea i?y all the<br />\nHopkins men. To this he argued<br />\nin his characteristic profane language, which was undoubtedly<br />\nemphatic, that he did not want<br />\nany Hopkins men up on the Century Roof! He made it clear that<br />\nhe did not need the money resulting from Hopkins patronage, and<br />\nthat he did not want it.<br />\nTo quote Mr. Whitehurst exactly would not furnish fit material for printing in our esteemed<br />\npublication, but I trust that Hopkins students, graduates and<br />\nfriends will comply with his very<br />\nearnest request and leave the<br />\nCentury Roof for the class of people to which he prefers to cater.<br />\nThat the patrons of the Roof<br />\ndid not object to the cheers or behavior of the Hopkins men is evidenced by the fact that the actions of Mr. Whitehurst in summoning the policemen was soundly hissed by the audience.<br />\nTruly yours,<br />\nDaniel E.

As there are unfortunately no other universities in Hawaii, intercollegiate football necessitated the importation of a team<br />\nfrom the mainland. The Universities of Oregon and Nevada kindly<br />\nobliged, and this year Pomona,<br />\nCalifornia, will try its luck with the<br />\nnew university.<br />\nBut football is not everything<br />\nin this world. Hawaii University<br />\nthis year has begun the issue of a<br />\ncollege paper, which will compare<br />\nfavorably with almost any similar<br />\npublication on the mainland. In<br />\nthe first issue is a most interesting<br />\narticle on Professor Richard Wrenshall, who is working on a specific for leprosy, and the international difficulties which are retarding its development.<br />\nPerhaps American college papers<br />\nwould be most interested in two<br />\nletters, one from W.
