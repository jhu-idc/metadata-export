For at<br />\nDu Pont, new and better products<br />\nare continually being developed.<br />\nFrom today's extended program of<br />\nfundamental research you can expect<br />\nmore neoprenes, more nylons, more<br />\nplastics like \"Teflon\" tetrafluoroethylene resin.<br />\nAs these products come out of the<br />\nlaboratory,they will bring with them<br />\na succession of interesting and challenging problems for the chemical<br />\nengineer. Problems that will arise<br />\nout of their very newness.<br />\nFor instance, take nylon, the first<br />\n<br />\nwholly synthetic organic fiber. In<br />\nworking out techniques for its commercial manufacture, there was<br />\npractically nothing to go on. The<br />\ncompounds of which it was made,<br />\nhex'amethylenediamine and adipic<br />\nacid, were essentially laboratory<br />\nchemicals. Processes had to be devised to make them from cheap raw<br />\nmaterials\u2014benzene, hydrogen, air<br />\nand ammonia. Large-scale preparation of nylon salt from amine and<br />\nacid required going beyond the classical unit operations.<br />\nHere for the first time it was proposed to extrude a fiber with extreme<br />\naccuracy from a melted polymer at<br />\n290\u00b0C. At this temperature the polymer decomposes slowly. It had to be<br />\nmelted, pumped at 5000 p.s.i. pressure through microscopic holes and4<br />\ncooled in a hurry. Otherwise the fiber<br />\nwould emerge discolored.<br />\nThe Du Pont chemical and mechanical engineers and other men<br />\nand women who worked with them<br />\nran into one difficulty after another.<br />\nMorethan once they thought that the<br />\n<br />\nproject would have to be abandoned.<br />\nHowever, it is basic in Du Pont<br />\npeople's philosophy not only to take<br />\non difficult pioneering problems, but<br />\nto see them through. With nylon,<br />\nthis persistence paid off handsomely.<br />\nIs this the kind of problem you'd<br />\nlike to attack, the kind of people<br />\nyou'd like to work with?<br />\n<br />\nSTUDYING<br />\n<br />\nZEPP PHOTO SUPPLY:<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n;<br />\n<br />\nEverything I'llotographic<br />\n<br />\nOPEN MON., WED., FRI.<br />\nTILL 9<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n3042 Greetimount Ave.<br />\nBE. 4900<br />\n<br />\nHEAR<br />\nVICTOR PERLO<br />\ntf)tinew New Deal Government<br />\nRcottomist and author of<br />\n'American Imperialism\"<br />\non<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nCrisis<br />\n<br />\nIn<br />\n<br />\nOur<br />\n<br />\nForeign Policy<br />\n<br />\nPYTHIAN CASTLE<br />\n1432 Penna.

If this<br />\naction fails to retard the suspected cheater he should be reported<br />\nto the Commission. An Honor System will never be successful<br />\nas long as one student allows another to cheat without at least<br />\nreporting the incident.<br />\nIn order to have this new system work smoothly, instructors<br />\nand others conducting tests must, at first, remind students that<br />\nthe new program is in effect. They themselves must also stand<br />\nfirmly behind the foundations of the Honor Plan Or their reminders shall serve to defeat the whole program.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nInsincerity or cynicism on behalf of instructors and others<br />\nwhom students respect will only weaken the plan.<br />\nPossibly the greatest fallacy in this plan would be' that<br />\nsoon a trite statement would follow each exam paper. Students<br />\nwould be signing an honor pledge through habit, not through<br />\nsincere awareness.<br />\nThe strength of the Honor Commission lies completely in the<br />\nhands of the students. If this new plan is to work successfully<br />\neveryone must cooperate in, at least, the realization that the<br />\nforced and enforced moral action of an honor eode carried out<br />\non one's own part is the lesser of evils means of upholding justice<br />\nand fairness.<br />\n<br />\nattempt to initiate a<br />\n<br />\nCONFERENCE IN THE CLOUDS<br />\nAmong the undergraduates on any college campus, you'll find<br />\nthe talk reaching up to the clouds.

That the giving of scholarships should be based solely on<br />\n<br />\nthe students educational ability<br />\nand financial need. This aid would<br />\nbe limited to tuition, lodging,<br />\nboard, and books. All scholarship<br />\nrequests by would-be athletes<br />\nmust travel through the same<br />\nchannels as any other scholarship<br />\nrequest.<br />\n2. That practices and games in<br />\nfootball, basketball, and baseball<br />\nbe limited to their specific seasons.<br />\nIn football this would mean<br />\nnothing before September 1 and<br />\nno activity later than the first<br />\nSaturday in December. It would<br />\neliminate all post-season games.<br />\nBasketball and baseball dates<br />\nwoud be December 1 to March 15<br />\nand March 1 to commencement<br />\nrespectively.<br />\n3. That neither freshmen nor<br />\ntransfer students be allowed to<br />\nplay on varsity teams. The freshmen, in order to get adjusted to<br />\ntheir new surroundings should<br />\ncompete in a schedule of their<br />\nown, and the transferees should<br />\nhave one year of residence before<br />\nbeing eligible to compete on a<br />\nvarsity team.<br />\nrecommendations, after<br />\nThe<br />\n<br />\nbeing drafted in their final form,<br />\nmust then be presented to the executive committee of the ACE before any further steps can be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nAthletic<br />\nDirector<br />\nMarshall<br />\nTurner, representing Johns Hopkins at the conference has been<br />\nworking together with Mr. Heimer of Gettysburg on a survey of<br />\nthe various athletic policies of<br />\nthe smaller colleges.<br />\nThe results of the survey<br />\nthough not yet complete, show<br />\nthat the great majority of smaller<br />\ninstitutions operate at a deficit.<br />\nAlso at these schools it has been<br />\nfound that the physical education<br />\ninstruction is co-ordinated with intercollegiate sports, while at the<br />\nlarger universities a system of<br />\nathletic associations is used.<br />\nMr. Turner feels that the NCAA<br />\nand the President's Committee<br />\nboth are anxious to straighten<br />\nout the athletic situation. He<br />\nfeels the Cincinnati conclave was<br />\nsatisfactory, but regrets only that<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nrecommendations<br />\nthe<br />\nPresident's Committee were not<br />\npresented in their final form.<br />\n<br />\nWith Marshall Turner attending<br />\nthe N.C.A.A. meeting in Cincinnati, young Mr. Margolis took over<br />\nthe reins and made his coaching<br />\npremiere a successful one. In fact,<br />\nhe added some contributions which<br />\nare unique for a Hopkins coach,<br />\nsuch as scoring fifteen points to<br />\nlead both squads and several times<br />\ndribbling the length of the floor<br />\nto score.<br />\nTwo impressive newcomers were<br />\nthe rapidly improving sophomores,<br />\nGeorge Klemmick and Bob Evans.<br />\nKlemmick tallied thirteen points,<br />\nsecond only to his coach, and<br />\nEvans tallied eight, while playing<br />\nanother fine rebound game.<br />\nKlemmick Hurt<br />\nKleminick's improvement, however, was retarded early in the<br />\nthird quarter when he aggravated<br />\nan old football injury to his knee.<br />\nThe torn ligaments were twisted<br />\nout of place, and he had to be<br />\nhelped from the court. He may<br />\nreturn to action tomorrow night.<br />\nJoe Della Ratta, C.U.'s muchheralded star, had one of his<br />\nworse nieits, scoring a mere thirteen p9ints.

For at<br />\nDu Pont, new and better products<br />\nare continually being developed.<br />\nFrom today's extended program of<br />\nfundamental research you can expect<br />\nmore neoprenes, more nylons, more<br />\nplastics like \"Teflon\" tetrafluoroethylene resin.<br />\nAs these products come out of the<br />\nlaboratory,they will bring with them<br />\na succession of interesting and challenging problems for the chemical<br />\nengineer. Problems that will arise<br />\nout of their very newness.<br />\nFor instance, take nylon, the first<br /><br />\nwholly synthetic organic fiber. In<br />\nworking out techniques for its commercial manufacture, there was<br />\npractically nothing to go on. The<br />\ncompounds of which it was made,<br />\nhex'amethylenediamine and adipic<br />\nacid, were essentially laboratory<br />\nchemicals. Processes had to be devised to make them from cheap raw<br />\nmaterials\u2014benzene, hydrogen, air<br />\nand ammonia. Large-scale preparation of nylon salt from amine and<br />\nacid required going beyond the classical unit operations.<br />\nHere for the first time it was proposed to extrude a fiber with extreme<br />\naccuracy from a melted polymer at<br />\n290\u00b0C. At this temperature the polymer decomposes slowly. It had to be<br />\nmelted, pumped at 5000 p.s.i. pressure through microscopic holes and4<br />\ncooled in a hurry. Otherwise the fiber<br />\nwould emerge discolored.<br />\nThe Du Pont chemical and mechanical engineers and other men<br />\nand women who worked with them<br />\nran into one difficulty after another.<br />\nMorethan once they thought that the<br /><br />\nproject would have to be abandoned.<br />\nHowever, it is basic in Du Pont<br />\npeople's philosophy not only to take<br />\non difficult pioneering problems, but<br />\nto see them through. With nylon,<br />\nthis persistence paid off handsomely.<br />\nIs this the kind of problem you'd<br />\nlike to attack, the kind of people<br />\nyou'd like to work with?<br /><br />\nSTUDYING<br /><br />\nZEPP PHOTO SUPPLY:<br /><br />\nI<br />\n;<br /><br />\nEverything I'llotographic<br /><br />\nOPEN MON., WED., FRI.<br />\nTILL 9<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\n3042 Greetimount Ave.<br />\nBE. 4900<br /><br />\nHEAR<br />\nVICTOR PERLO<br />\ntf)tinew New Deal Government<br />\nRcottomist and author of<br />\n'American Imperialism\"<br />\non<br />\nThe<br /><br />\nCrisis<br /><br />\nIn<br /><br />\nOur<br /><br />\nForeign Policy<br /><br />\nPYTHIAN CASTLE<br />\n1432 Penna.

If this<br />\naction fails to retard the suspected cheater he should be reported<br />\nto the Commission. An Honor System will never be successful<br />\nas long as one student allows another to cheat without at least<br />\nreporting the incident.<br />\nIn order to have this new system work smoothly, instructors<br />\nand others conducting tests must, at first, remind students that<br />\nthe new program is in effect. They themselves must also stand<br />\nfirmly behind the foundations of the Honor Plan Or their reminders shall serve to defeat the whole program.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nInsincerity or cynicism on behalf of instructors and others<br />\nwhom students respect will only weaken the plan.<br />\nPossibly the greatest fallacy in this plan would be' that<br />\nsoon a trite statement would follow each exam paper. Students<br />\nwould be signing an honor pledge through habit, not through<br />\nsincere awareness.<br />\nThe strength of the Honor Commission lies completely in the<br />\nhands of the students. If this new plan is to work successfully<br />\neveryone must cooperate in, at least, the realization that the<br />\nforced and enforced moral action of an honor eode carried out<br />\non one's own part is the lesser of evils means of upholding justice<br />\nand fairness.<br /><br />\nattempt to initiate a<br /><br />\nCONFERENCE IN THE CLOUDS<br />\nAmong the undergraduates on any college campus, you'll find<br />\nthe talk reaching up to the clouds.

That the giving of scholarships should be based solely on<br /><br />\nthe students educational ability<br />\nand financial need. This aid would<br />\nbe limited to tuition, lodging,<br />\nboard, and books. All scholarship<br />\nrequests by would-be athletes<br />\nmust travel through the same<br />\nchannels as any other scholarship<br />\nrequest.<br />\n2. That practices and games in<br />\nfootball, basketball, and baseball<br />\nbe limited to their specific seasons.<br />\nIn football this would mean<br />\nnothing before September 1 and<br />\nno activity later than the first<br />\nSaturday in December. It would<br />\neliminate all post-season games.<br />\nBasketball and baseball dates<br />\nwoud be December 1 to March 15<br />\nand March 1 to commencement<br />\nrespectively.<br />\n3. That neither freshmen nor<br />\ntransfer students be allowed to<br />\nplay on varsity teams. The freshmen, in order to get adjusted to<br />\ntheir new surroundings should<br />\ncompete in a schedule of their<br />\nown, and the transferees should<br />\nhave one year of residence before<br />\nbeing eligible to compete on a<br />\nvarsity team.<br />\nrecommendations, after<br />\nThe<br /><br />\nbeing drafted in their final form,<br />\nmust then be presented to the executive committee of the ACE before any further steps can be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nAthletic<br />\nDirector<br />\nMarshall<br />\nTurner, representing Johns Hopkins at the conference has been<br />\nworking together with Mr. Heimer of Gettysburg on a survey of<br />\nthe various athletic policies of<br />\nthe smaller colleges.<br />\nThe results of the survey<br />\nthough not yet complete, show<br />\nthat the great majority of smaller<br />\ninstitutions operate at a deficit.<br />\nAlso at these schools it has been<br />\nfound that the physical education<br />\ninstruction is co-ordinated with intercollegiate sports, while at the<br />\nlarger universities a system of<br />\nathletic associations is used.<br />\nMr. Turner feels that the NCAA<br />\nand the President's Committee<br />\nboth are anxious to straighten<br />\nout the athletic situation. He<br />\nfeels the Cincinnati conclave was<br />\nsatisfactory, but regrets only that<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nrecommendations<br />\nthe<br />\nPresident's Committee were not<br />\npresented in their final form.<br /><br />\nWith Marshall Turner attending<br />\nthe N.C.A.A. meeting in Cincinnati, young Mr. Margolis took over<br />\nthe reins and made his coaching<br />\npremiere a successful one. In fact,<br />\nhe added some contributions which<br />\nare unique for a Hopkins coach,<br />\nsuch as scoring fifteen points to<br />\nlead both squads and several times<br />\ndribbling the length of the floor<br />\nto score.<br />\nTwo impressive newcomers were<br />\nthe rapidly improving sophomores,<br />\nGeorge Klemmick and Bob Evans.<br />\nKlemmick tallied thirteen points,<br />\nsecond only to his coach, and<br />\nEvans tallied eight, while playing<br />\nanother fine rebound game.<br />\nKlemmick Hurt<br />\nKleminick's improvement, however, was retarded early in the<br />\nthird quarter when he aggravated<br />\nan old football injury to his knee.<br />\nThe torn ligaments were twisted<br />\nout of place, and he had to be<br />\nhelped from the court. He may<br />\nreturn to action tomorrow night.<br />\nJoe Della Ratta, C.U.'s muchheralded star, had one of his<br />\nworse nieits, scoring a mere thirteen p9ints.
