I don't see that we can<br />\nworry too much about trifles.<br />\nThe thing that gets you is the slant. I don't<br />\nknow for a fact that Mr D was actually weaned at<br />\nCollege Park, but every now and then he says<br />\nsomething that strikes me as an evidence of over-<br />\n<br />\nFax Davis<br />\n<br />\nripe provincialism. Occasionally he smoulders with<br />\nan animosity that could only come out of Upper<br />\nAsia, the sort of thing one had hoped, unfortunately, might be at an end in the elevated brackets<br />\nof higher learning way up-hyere. Ah, the disillusionment of it all.<br />\nWhat really has me going is the fear that Mr<br />\nDuncan either lost his glasses the day he came to<br />\nHopkins, or that his esthetic sense has been woefully neglected. The peaceful vales of College<br />\nPark may indeed have their points of resemblance<br />\nto the Forest of Arden, but the last time I was<br />\naround those parts, some carefree youth had<br />\npainted signs screaming \"JHU\" all over those big,<br />\nwhite columns that Mr D loves so well. Of course,<br />\nwe at Homewood can be grateful for the surprising loyalty of Maryland frosh in keeping alive the<br />\nspirit of JHU, but, really, their vandalism\u2014! One<br />\ncan only conclude that something is lacking in an<br />\nacademic curriculum that allows those happy but<br />\nignorant children to deface their own campus in<br />\nso vindictive a manner.<br />\n<br />\nDisarmament With Inspection.<br />\nModern nations cannot afford to have atomarmed enemies anywhere on the face of the earth.<br />\nSince they cannot get rid of their enemies except<br />\nby war, they all have got to get rid of their armaments\u2014that is, if they care about security. Now,<br />\nonly a fool would propose to do that without adequate international inspection, and a world authority<br />\ncompetent to supervise the disarmament of the<br />\nnations, and to keep them disarmed. The only<br />\nkind of authority capable of performing these duties<br />\nIs a world government with powers, adequate, but<br />\nlimited to the performance of these functions.<br />\nWithout government, ideological conflict, economic strife, and all other controversies are potential causes of war, and lead 'to war in the world<br />\nanarchy in which we live. With a common government, the battles are fought, in the courts, the<br />\nlegislative assemblies, town meetings and in the<br />\npress. The United States does not declare war on<br />\nthe State of New York when one of its- citizens<br />\ncommits a crime, but he is tried in court. Federal<br />\nLaw applicable upon individual citizens obviates<br />\ncoercion of states by war; there is no other way to<br />\npunish the guilty without killing the innocent.<br />\nWorld law is the only alternative to world war.<br />\nPeople Must Want It<br />\nAlmost everybody is agreed on this point, including even professional diplomats. The trouble,<br />\nthey say, is that world government, though necessary, is impossible. And so it is, until enough<br />\npeople want it, until enough people demand it, and<br />\nuntil enough people make it possible.

I suppose that a few purists might<br />\nobject to certain liberties he takes with syntax,<br />\nothers might get goose-pimples at the way he<br />\nlabors the obvious, but what the hell\u2014they<br />\nlaughed at Hemingway. I don't see that we can<br />\nworry too much about trifles.<br />\nThe thing that gets you is the slant. I don't<br />\nknow for a fact that Mr D was actually weaned at<br />\nCollege Park, but every now and then he says<br />\nsomething that strikes me as an evidence of over-<br /><br />\nFax Davis<br /><br />\nripe provincialism. Occasionally he smoulders with<br />\nan animosity that could only come out of Upper<br />\nAsia, the sort of thing one had hoped, unfortunately, might be at an end in the elevated brackets<br />\nof higher learning way up-hyere. Ah, the disillusionment of it all.<br />\nWhat really has me going is the fear that Mr<br />\nDuncan either lost his glasses the day he came to<br />\nHopkins, or that his esthetic sense has been woefully neglected. The peaceful vales of College<br />\nPark may indeed have their points of resemblance<br />\nto the Forest of Arden, but the last time I was<br />\naround those parts, some carefree youth had<br />\npainted signs screaming \"JHU\" all over those big,<br />\nwhite columns that Mr D loves so well. Of course,<br />\nwe at Homewood can be grateful for the surprising loyalty of Maryland frosh in keeping alive the<br />\nspirit of JHU, but, really, their vandalism\u2014!

Now,<br />\nonly a fool would propose to do that without adequate international inspection, and a world authority<br />\ncompetent to supervise the disarmament of the<br />\nnations, and to keep them disarmed. The only<br />\nkind of authority capable of performing these duties<br />\nIs a world government with powers, adequate, but<br />\nlimited to the performance of these functions.<br />\nWithout government, ideological conflict, economic strife, and all other controversies are potential causes of war, and lead 'to war in the world<br />\nanarchy in which we live. With a common government, the battles are fought, in the courts, the<br />\nlegislative assemblies, town meetings and in the<br />\npress. The United States does not declare war on<br />\nthe State of New York when one of its- citizens<br />\ncommits a crime, but he is tried in court. Federal<br />\nLaw applicable upon individual citizens obviates<br />\ncoercion of states by war; there is no other way to<br />\npunish the guilty without killing the innocent.<br />\nWorld law is the only alternative to world war.<br />\nPeople Must Want It<br />\nAlmost everybody is agreed on this point, including even professional diplomats. The trouble,<br />\nthey say, is that world government, though necessary, is impossible. And so it is, until enough<br />\npeople want it, until enough people demand it, and<br />\nuntil enough people make it possible.
