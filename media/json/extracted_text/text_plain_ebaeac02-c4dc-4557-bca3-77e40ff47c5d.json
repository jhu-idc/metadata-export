Mr. Marbury does not question the energy of the authorities<br />\ntoward giving the University publicity; he merely takes exception to<br />\none or two of the methods which<br />\nDr. Buchner has outlined. With<br />\ncertain of his criticisms THE NEWSLETTER is inclined to agree\u2014for<br />\ninstance, his dissent from Dr. Buchner's statement that \"The best advertisement of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is an alumnus on a college faculty.\" Dr. Buchner's statement is true in one sense, and in<br />\nanother sense misleading. Such an<br />\nadvertisement is the best that the<br />\nUniversity can have in what it<br />\nshows, but it is rather inadequate<br />\nin that other requirements of a good<br />\nadvertisement\u2014the number of persons it reaches. It demonstrates the<br />\nefficiency of the University in turning out men of culture and scholarship, but its appeal is directed only<br />\nto the limited few who, looking forward to scholastic careers themselves, are familiar with the personnel of college faculties. The great<br />\npublic it does not reach; and here<br />\nthe woik of a university largely lies.<br />\nTo train educators is of course a necessary and important task; but what<br />\nis the office of an educator if not<br />\nto give of his own culture to others?<br />\nAnd what is the function of a university, which is a collection of educators, if not to raise the cultural<br />\nlevel of the general public? To this<br />\nend is is desirable that the University should be known to the world<br />\nof merchants, farmers, bankers and<br />\nmen of affairs; and the appeal to<br />\nthese men must be directed into<br />\nchannels that will actually, reach<br />\nthem. No one has done better work<br />\n<br />\nLEMMERT<br />\n<br />\nin this direction than Dr. Buchner<br />\nhimself, by his connection with the<br />\nState school system, in the course \"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nof which he has come into contact<br />\nwith persons from all sections of<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \u201cClothes.\"<br />\nMaryland.

At other institutions, minor<br />\nsports are under the government of<br />\nsuch a board, and the widespread<br />\ninterest which has been taken here<br />\nduring the last few years in tennis<br />\nand basket ball would seem to<br />\njustify the establishment of one at<br />\nHopkins. Were such activities as<br />\nbasket ball and tennis given a definite standing as minor sports, there<br />\nwould not be, as Mr. Belt points out,<br />\nthat contest between the party who<br />\nfeel that these sports should be<br />\nrecognized and the other party who<br />\ndo not think them worthy to be<br />\nplaced on the same level as football<br />\nand lacrosse.

Buchner. Dr. Buchner attempts to answer the recent criticisms of the Class of 1902 anent the<br />\nlack of publicity given to University<br />\nhappenings, and, in view of what he<br />\nsays, I believe it due that class to<br />\nput its ideas more definitely before<br />\nyour readers.<br />\nThe Class of 1902 looks at the<br />\nmatter, not from \"the point of views<br />\nof the University,\" which your article (I hope incorrectly) attributes<br />\nto Dr. Buchner, but from the standpoint of the men ten years removed<br />\nfrom collegiate life, and loving their<br />\nalma mater so much the more because they do not and cannot any<br />\n<br />\nlonger think everything done and<br />\neverything believed by her directors<br />\nperfect per se. Surely we are not<br />\nto be blamed because we do not<br />\nadopt the narrow view, when we<br />\nknow by actual experience that<br />\nthere are things to be remedied, and<br />\nwhen it is our duty, as loyal alumni,<br />\nto do our share in helping the University where we can.<br />\nI call your attention to three significant quotations from Dr. Buchner\u2014significant because they embody the views against which we<br />\nprotest.<br />\nFirst\u2014\"The best advertisement of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University is<br />\nthe alumnus on a college faculty.\"<br />\nSecond\u2014\"There are many sources<br />\nof information at the hands of the<br />\nalumni.

In our<br />\ncase lacrosse would be substituted<br />\nfor rowing. The minor sports association takes under its wing all<br />\nthe rest--basket ball, tennis, golf,<br />\nhockey, swimming. Nvrestling. boxing, etc.<br />\nWe, of course, have not:die facilities to support a large number of<br />\nteams, but I, think a goOdasei',414s<br />\nbeen made out so far for idtinis<br />\nand .basket ball. The minijr . sports<br />\nidea, therefore, might be adopted to<br />\nour requirements in this way.<br />\nThere 'should he a minor sports<br />\neornmitteeappointed for this year7-but elected in the future, composed of one undergraduate, one<br />\nalumnus, and one undergraduate<br />\nmember of. the Athletic Board: In<br />\nthis form the Athletic Board would<br />\n'k\u2014<br />\nnOW \u2022what Was-- 'going on in\"inirior<br />\nsports, would be able 'to see that<br />\nthey did not 'conflict NVitli, or injure<br />\nin any way thc Major 'sports;'ahd at<br />\nthe same time' could 'be' relieved of<br />\nthe butilen of,close oversight:,<br />\nAs the Athletic Board derives<br />\na large part of its revenue from<br />\nthe locker fees of all the students, whether interested in its<br />\nparticular major sports or not, it<br />\ncould :appropriate, say, $tod. a year,<br />\nto the support of the minor sports<br />\ncommittee, any other funds that the<br />\nlatter needed being 'supplied by<br />\nrevenue derived from guarantees<br />\nor games that did not interfere or<br />\ninjure in any way any major sport.<br />\nThe minor sports committee would<br />\neasily be self-supporting, except for<br />\nthis $1oo from the Athletic Association, which certainly owes that<br />\nmuch to the large percentage of<br />\nmen who would like to play on some<br />\nteam, but are not proficient in our<br />\nfour present Major sports.<br />\nLet me make this point very clear.<br />\nI am not proposing that the Athletic<br />\nBoard recognize basket ball or tennis\u2014far from it. I would simply .<br />\nlike to see those two games put on<br />\na firm and enduring footing. I<br />\nthink the general consensus of opinion is that these ,to and many<br />\nothers are not major sports and<br />\nnever will be. It is customary in<br />\nmany colleges to award to the memberp of.minor sports teams secondary letters such as \"B 'H B\" for<br />\nbasket ball, etc. This recognition<br />\n<br />\nmight be. used here if the power<br />\nwas given to the minor sports committee for .future use, if the teams<br />\nmade good, by the. General Athletic<br />\nAssociation when it meets in May.<br />\nIf, as the University enlarges and<br />\nthe student body and the facilities<br />\ngrow, there is a demand for other<br />\nteams, such as swimming and rowing, these also might be undertaken<br />\nby the committee if it were feasible.<br />\nAlready the Athletic Board appropriates $35 each year for a tennis<br />\ntournament (and team if possible),<br />\nand appoints a committee to run it.<br />\nUnder the plan suggested, this and<br />\nsimilar subsidiary committees' work<br />\nwould be taken over and made \u00b0permanent by the minor sports committee at only a slightly .increased<br />\ncost and with much more satisfaction to everyone concerned. To sum up:<br />\nI. Basket ball and tennis have<br />\nshown their right to some kind of<br />\na permanent position. .<br />\n2. The position of minor .sports<br />\nwould satisfy nearly everyone concerned.<br />\n3. They could be more satisfactorily managed by a committee, one<br />\nmember of which was also a student<br />\nmember .of the Athletic Board.<br />\n4. They can \u2022 be financed, undoubtedly, under this plan.<br />\n5. It will relieve the Athletic<br />\nBoard of the continuous agitation<br />\neach year that it recognize one team<br />\nor another.<br />\nI would suggest that the Athletic<br />\nBoard appoint this committee, composed as I said, of one student member of the Athletic Board, one almnnus and one other student; to serve<br />\nout the remainder of the present \u2022<br />\nyear, and that a new one -(or. t feast<br />\nthe two members not selected from<br />\n-its own number by - the Athletic<br />\nBoard) be elected- or .re-elected by<br />\nthe Athletic Association in 'May at<br />\nthe same time that, the :Athletic<br />\nBoard is elected.<br />\nThis'suggestion is. Offered to the<br />\n\u2022students of the University. to \u2022 be<br />\nacted upon 'by the Athletic'. pard<br />\nat its next meeting, and if not by<br />\nthem, then by the General Athletic<br />\nAssociation.<br />\nDONALD K.

Mr. Marbury does not question the energy of the authorities<br />\ntoward giving the University publicity; he merely takes exception to<br />\none or two of the methods which<br />\nDr. Buchner has outlined. With<br />\ncertain of his criticisms THE NEWSLETTER is inclined to agree\u2014for<br />\ninstance, his dissent from Dr. Buchner's statement that \"The best advertisement of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity is an alumnus on a college faculty.\" Dr. Buchner's statement is true in one sense, and in<br />\nanother sense misleading. Such an<br />\nadvertisement is the best that the<br />\nUniversity can have in what it<br />\nshows, but it is rather inadequate<br />\nin that other requirements of a good<br />\nadvertisement\u2014the number of persons it reaches. It demonstrates the<br />\nefficiency of the University in turning out men of culture and scholarship, but its appeal is directed only<br />\nto the limited few who, looking forward to scholastic careers themselves, are familiar with the personnel of college faculties. The great<br />\npublic it does not reach; and here<br />\nthe woik of a university largely lies.<br />\nTo train educators is of course a necessary and important task; but what<br />\nis the office of an educator if not<br />\nto give of his own culture to others?<br />\nAnd what is the function of a university, which is a collection of educators, if not to raise the cultural<br />\nlevel of the general public? To this<br />\nend is is desirable that the University should be known to the world<br />\nof merchants, farmers, bankers and<br />\nmen of affairs; and the appeal to<br />\nthese men must be directed into<br />\nchannels that will actually, reach<br />\nthem. No one has done better work<br /><br />\nLEMMERT<br /><br />\nin this direction than Dr. Buchner<br />\nhimself, by his connection with the<br />\nState school system, in the course \"READY TO WEAR\" CLOTHES FOR YOUNG MEN<br />\nof which he has come into contact<br />\nwith persons from all sections of<br />\nThe Best Merchant Tailoring Characterizes our \u201cClothes.\"<br />\nMaryland.

At other institutions, minor<br />\nsports are under the government of<br />\nsuch a board, and the widespread<br />\ninterest which has been taken here<br />\nduring the last few years in tennis<br />\nand basket ball would seem to<br />\njustify the establishment of one at<br />\nHopkins. Were such activities as<br />\nbasket ball and tennis given a definite standing as minor sports, there<br />\nwould not be, as Mr. Belt points out,<br />\nthat contest between the party who<br />\nfeel that these sports should be<br />\nrecognized and the other party who<br />\ndo not think them worthy to be<br />\nplaced on the same level as football<br />\nand lacrosse.

Buchner. Dr. Buchner attempts to answer the recent criticisms of the Class of 1902 anent the<br />\nlack of publicity given to University<br />\nhappenings, and, in view of what he<br />\nsays, I believe it due that class to<br />\nput its ideas more definitely before<br />\nyour readers.<br />\nThe Class of 1902 looks at the<br />\nmatter, not from \"the point of views<br />\nof the University,\" which your article (I hope incorrectly) attributes<br />\nto Dr. Buchner, but from the standpoint of the men ten years removed<br />\nfrom collegiate life, and loving their<br />\nalma mater so much the more because they do not and cannot any<br /><br />\nlonger think everything done and<br />\neverything believed by her directors<br />\nperfect per se. Surely we are not<br />\nto be blamed because we do not<br />\nadopt the narrow view, when we<br />\nknow by actual experience that<br />\nthere are things to be remedied, and<br />\nwhen it is our duty, as loyal alumni,<br />\nto do our share in helping the University where we can.<br />\nI call your attention to three significant quotations from Dr. Buchner\u2014significant because they embody the views against which we<br />\nprotest.<br />\nFirst\u2014\"The best advertisement of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University is<br />\nthe alumnus on a college faculty.\"<br />\nSecond\u2014\"There are many sources<br />\nof information at the hands of the<br />\nalumni.

BALTIMORE ST.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 20, 1913.<br />\nMAIL BAG<br />\n(Continuedfrom Inzeg 5, col. 3.)<br />\nMinor Sports Committee.<br /><br />\nJANUARY 18, 1913.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE N6ys-LET1tiz:<br />\n_ Dear ,Sir\u2014I would like to offer<br />\nthe following suggestions as a solution of the difficulty the Athletic<br />\nBoard has over the basket ball, tennis and other minor sports enthusiasts at Hopkins-. \u2022<br />\nIn most universities with a large<br />\n-enrollment of students, and with<br />\n.many games recognized in ,order<br />\nto afford opportunity to all those .<br />\nwho desire to take part in some<br />\nsport, it is the custom to have two<br />\nathletic associations,' a major and<br />\nminor.<br />\nThe major has control of the four<br />\n\u201emajor . sports generallyfootball,<br />\nbaseball, track and rowing. In our<br />\ncase lacrosse would be substituted<br />\nfor rowing. The minor sports association takes under its wing all<br />\nthe rest--basket ball, tennis, golf,<br />\nhockey, swimming. Nvrestling. boxing, etc.<br />\nWe, of course, have not:die facilities to support a large number of<br />\nteams, but I, think a goOdasei',414s<br />\nbeen made out so far for idtinis<br />\nand .basket ball. The minijr . sports<br />\nidea, therefore, might be adopted to<br />\nour requirements in this way.<br />\nThere 'should he a minor sports<br />\neornmitteeappointed for this year7-but elected in the future, composed of one undergraduate, one<br />\nalumnus, and one undergraduate<br />\nmember of. the Athletic Board: In<br />\nthis form the Athletic Board would<br />\n'k\u2014<br />\nnOW \u2022what Was-- 'going on in\"inirior<br />\nsports, would be able 'to see that<br />\nthey did not 'conflict NVitli, or injure<br />\nin any way thc Major 'sports;'ahd at<br />\nthe same time' could 'be' relieved of<br />\nthe butilen of,close oversight:,<br />\nAs the Athletic Board derives<br />\na large part of its revenue from<br />\nthe locker fees of all the students, whether interested in its<br />\nparticular major sports or not, it<br />\ncould :appropriate, say, $tod. a year,<br />\nto the support of the minor sports<br />\ncommittee, any other funds that the<br />\nlatter needed being 'supplied by<br />\nrevenue derived from guarantees<br />\nor games that did not interfere or<br />\ninjure in any way any major sport.<br />\nThe minor sports committee would<br />\neasily be self-supporting, except for<br />\nthis $1oo from the Athletic Association, which certainly owes that<br />\nmuch to the large percentage of<br />\nmen who would like to play on some<br />\nteam, but are not proficient in our<br />\nfour present Major sports.<br />\nLet me make this point very clear.<br />\nI am not proposing that the Athletic<br />\nBoard recognize basket ball or tennis\u2014far from it. I would simply .<br />\nlike to see those two games put on<br />\na firm and enduring footing. I<br />\nthink the general consensus of opinion is that these ,to and many<br />\nothers are not major sports and<br />\nnever will be. It is customary in<br />\nmany colleges to award to the memberp of.minor sports teams secondary letters such as \"B 'H B\" for<br />\nbasket ball, etc. This recognition<br /><br />\nmight be. used here if the power<br />\nwas given to the minor sports committee for .future use, if the teams<br />\nmade good, by the. General Athletic<br />\nAssociation when it meets in May.<br />\nIf, as the University enlarges and<br />\nthe student body and the facilities<br />\ngrow, there is a demand for other<br />\nteams, such as swimming and rowing, these also might be undertaken<br />\nby the committee if it were feasible.<br />\nAlready the Athletic Board appropriates $35 each year for a tennis<br />\ntournament (and team if possible),<br />\nand appoints a committee to run it.<br />\nUnder the plan suggested, this and<br />\nsimilar subsidiary committees' work<br />\nwould be taken over and made \u00b0permanent by the minor sports committee at only a slightly .increased<br />\ncost and with much more satisfaction to everyone concerned. To sum up:<br />\nI. Basket ball and tennis have<br />\nshown their right to some kind of<br />\na permanent position. .<br />\n2. The position of minor .sports<br />\nwould satisfy nearly everyone concerned.<br />\n3. They could be more satisfactorily managed by a committee, one<br />\nmember of which was also a student<br />\nmember .of the Athletic Board.<br />\n4. They can \u2022 be financed, undoubtedly, under this plan.<br />\n5. It will relieve the Athletic<br />\nBoard of the continuous agitation<br />\neach year that it recognize one team<br />\nor another.<br />\nI would suggest that the Athletic<br />\nBoard appoint this committee, composed as I said, of one student member of the Athletic Board, one almnnus and one other student; to serve<br />\nout the remainder of the present \u2022<br />\nyear, and that a new one -(or. t feast<br />\nthe two members not selected from<br />\n-its own number by - the Athletic<br />\nBoard) be elected- or .re-elected by<br />\nthe Athletic Association in 'May at<br />\nthe same time that, the :Athletic<br />\nBoard is elected.<br />\nThis'suggestion is. Offered to the<br />\n\u2022students of the University. to \u2022 be<br />\nacted upon 'by the Athletic'. pard<br />\nat its next meeting, and if not by<br />\nthem, then by the General Athletic<br />\nAssociation.<br />\nDONALD K.
