The signers objected<br />\nto the manner in which the<br />\nAdministration went about developing and publicizing the new<br />\nrules. They suggested that a<br />\nstudent-administration discussion of<br />\nthe issue could create \"a better<br />\nsolution than a blanket ban.\"<br />\nKavee said that only 10<br />\npercent of the students approached to sign the petitions<br />\nrefused to get involved.

Complaints<br />\nagainst a specific dog could be<br />\nregistered with the committee,<br />\nwhich would decide upon the<br />\nappropriate disciplinary action<br />\n(including fines and/or loss of<br />\ncampus privileges).<br />\nKavee noted that when<br />\nDean Hall was first approached<br />\nwith the plan for a regulatory<br />\ncommittee, he discouraged it.<br />\nOne objection, Kavee believes,<br />\nwas the proposal that complaints<br />\nbe called in to the University.<br />\nswitchboard.<br />\nThe plan was<br />\nsubsequently modified to direct<br />\nthe calls to the Student Council<br />\noffice.<br />\nAt the Student Council<br />\nmeeting, President<br />\nMichael<br />\nSteele revealed that he had<br />\nspoken with Dean Owen about<br />\nthe problem. Owen conceded<br />\nthat the new policy was<br />\n<br />\n\"tough,\" said Steele.<br />\nCouncil members suggested<br />\nthat enforcement of the policy<br />\nbe delayed until September 1.<br />\nThis would give a student<br />\ncommittee time to investigate<br />\nthe problem, review policy, and<br />\nrecommend a course of action<br />\nthat would be \"fairer\" to all<br />\nconcerned. Steele added that<br />\nextension of the deadline would<br />\ngive students time to find new<br />\nhousing for their pets if necessary. He asked for the Council<br />\nto approve the creation of an ad<br />\nhoc committee to deal with the<br />\nproblem.<br />\n\"I'm pleased with the decision,\" said Kavee.

The<br />\nrelease of the American hostages<br />\nwas no exception:<br />\nbefore<br />\nanyone had an opportunity to<br />\nform his or her own feelings<br />\nabout their freedom, the American media had already formed it<br />\nfor us. The offspring of each<br />\nnetwork's, newspaper's, and<br />\npublishing house's attempt to<br />\ntell us what personal significance<br />\nthis should have for each of us<br />\nbefore anyone else had the<br />\nchance to tell us what personal<br />\nsignificance this should have for<br />\neach of us has been just as crass<br />\nand ugly as usual.<br />\nThere is a branch of the<br />\npublishing business whose function is to follow every major<br />\n<br />\nnews event with a flood of<br />\nbooks informing the public of<br />\ninformation which is already<br />\ncommon knowledge. Most major<br />\npublishing houses hire task<br />\nforces of writers who are on<br />\nstand-by continuously for another major tragedy to explode<br />\non the evening news and then<br />\nget right down to writing a<br />\nbook on the subject.<br />\nFor<br />\nexample, the day that the<br />\nGuyana incident was announced,<br />\neach squad of writers was sent a<br />\nmanila envelope full of newspaper clippings, transcripts from<br />\ntelevision news, and still photographs.<br />\nThe writers locked<br />\nthemselves in seclusion for two<br />\ndays, churning out as much<br />\ncomprehensible regurgitation of<br />\nthe facts as possible, and handed<br />\nin completed manuscripts for a<br />\nfinal four books on the subject<br />\nto be released 5-10 days after<br />\nthe date of the massacre. The<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nSorry, No Fight This Time<br />\nThe firing of Marge Mareck, formerly a<br />\nsecretary at the University's Eisenhower<br />\nProject, has all the right ingredients for yet<br />\nanother Us vs. Them standoff. There is the<br />\nExploited Employee, whose only crime was<br />\nto ask for more money; there is the Administration, acting through its usual haze<br />\nof Official Blather; there are the Angry<br />\nStudents, demanding in sanctimonious<br />\nterms that the rights of the \"exploited' be<br />\nprotected; and there is even an Evil Employer, bad Dr. Galambos, spewing forth<br />\norders faster than anyone could take.<br />\nFortunately, one simple thing saves us<br />\nfrom such a confrontation--Mrs. Mareck<br />\nsimply doesn't have a case.<br />\nThe S500 pay increase she demanded<br />\nmay indeed have been merited; that is not<br />\nthe issue. There has to be a casual link<br />\nbetween her request and her firing for her<br />\nto claim an injustice\u2014and, unless someone<br />\nreally is hiding something, that link doesn't<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nexist.<br />\nFor whatever reasons, working<br />\nrelations do deteriorate--something that<br />\nboth Mareck and Galambos acknowledge.<br />\nThose involved in the formation of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Employees Association<br />\nshould, however, be praised. There is no<br />\nreason to believe that this University, as an<br />\nemployer is any less generally mean and<br />\nrotten than anyone else. Rather than<br />\nharping about sporadic cases of perceived<br />\nwrongdoing, the Association seems willing<br />\nto work towards a better situation for<br />\nboth sides (and dropping the idea of<br />\n\"sides\" seems a useful place to start).<br />\nFor a group who supposedly wears their<br />\napathy like a badge, the students involved<br />\nin the case acted with a remarkable degree<br />\nof self-righteousness; they should remember that the final criterion should be a<br />\nmeasure of right or wrong action taken,<br />\nand not a measure of eloquent or angry<br />\nwords.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nof WJHU is now geared solely to<br />\nthe interests of the outside<br />\ncommunity and not to the<br />\nstudents.

In particular, in<br />\nputting an end to the practice<br />\nof leaving one's dog tied up to a<br />\ntree or building while one is<br />\ninside, it discriminates against<br />\nthose owners who use their<br />\nanimals as protective escorts<br />\nwhen walking to and from the<br />\nuniversity and around the campus itself.<br />\nThat this campus is not an<br />\nentirely safe place, especially for<br />\nan individual walking alone, and<br />\nthis despite the best efforts of<br />\nour security force, has been<br />\nbrought by students to the<br />\nadministration's attention during<br />\nthe past year. That this campus<br />\nand the areas which surround it<br />\nare especially unsafe for women<br />\nhas also been called to your<br />\nattention. Is there so little<br />\nregard for the welfare of the<br />\nfemale students at Hopkins that<br />\nit clouds vision on these matters<br />\nand allows you to forget our<br />\nneeds when you issue an order<br />\nthat dramatically affects us?<br />\nAs a woman, my freedom of<br />\nsafe and unrestricted movement<br />\nis already drastically curtailed by<br />\nthe existing conditions of urban<br />\nlife and the threat to my personal security that is constant<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nReaders Express Canine Sentiments<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\nand real. I could not walk<br />\naround the Hopkins campus at<br />\nthe times that I wish to if I were<br />\nnot accompanied by my dog,<br />\nmuch less walk home at night.<br />\nWhile the van system provides<br />\nmuch-needed<br />\nand<br />\nvaluable<br />\ntransportation for those who<br />\nwish to use it, this service is<br />\nlimited to the immediate vicinity<br />\nof Homewood and does not<br />\nreach many areas where women<br />\nwant and can afford to live. As<br />\na teaching assistant for the<br />\nuniversity, my salary does not<br />\npermit me to rent comparable<br />\nhousing any closer to campus.<br />\nAlthough I find the empty<br />\nbeer can and broken bottles at<br />\nleast as much of an unsightly<br />\nhazard as whatever \"mess\" dogs<br />\non campus may have caused,<br />\nthere are ways of cleaning up the<br />\ngrounds other than the restrictions on dogs that you have<br />\nordered. New York City has<br />\n<br />\ninstituted a penalty for not<br />\ncleaning up after one's dog that<br />\n\u2022has been working quite well for<br />\nseveral months. Perhaps Hopkins would like to try something<br />\nsimilar. Enforcement of a rule<br />\nthat all dogs must be accompanied or leashed at all times would<br />\neliminate roaming dogs and the<br />\ntrouble they might cause. And<br />\nsurely arrangements could be<br />\nworked out with the maintenance staff concerning dogs kept<br />\nin offices or labs whose owners<br />\nwould like them around for<br />\ncompany and protection, especially at night. Finally, I would<br />\nsuggest some sort of voluntary<br />\nlicensing procedure which would<br />\nallow complaints of behaviors<br />\nthat annoy others, such as noise<br />\nor intimidation, to be registered<br />\nagainst their owners, who<br />\nwould\u2014and should--bear the responsibility for their pets'<br />\nactions.<br />\n<br />\nThe administration's decisions wrongly assume that all of<br />\nus who own dogs are unwilling<br />\nto assume proper responsibility<br />\nfor them. It seeks to enforce a<br />\nsevere restriction that was issued<br />\nwithout input from the majority<br />\nof those who use the Homewood<br />\ncampus and consider it part of.<br />\nstudents.<br />\ntheir<br />\nschool--the<br />\nMoreover, it overlooks both that<br />\nsome of us bring our dogs to<br />\ncampus for reasons of our own<br />\nsecurity and that while walking<br />\naround on the grounds with our<br />\ndogs, we add to others' security<br />\nas well. I am much more capable of intervening if I come<br />\nacross something suspicious or<br />\nunsafe if I have my dog with me<br />\nthan I would be prepared to do<br />\nalone.<br />\nA variety of other efforts<br />\nthat would ultimately meet<br />\nmore of our needs could be<br />\nmade. I would like to strongly<br />\n<br />\nGrant On Media On Iran<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nsame phenomenon occurred after Elvis Presley's death, John<br />\nLennon's shooting, the election<br />\nof Ronald Reagan...and now, the<br />\nhostages.<br />\nOn the shelves of bookstores around the country currently rest countless copies of<br />\n444 Days, a day-to-day account<br />\nof the \"hostage crisis\" (a favorite news buzzword). \"Day-today\" is an apt description of it:<br />\nafter each day of news on the<br />\nhostages, another section drawn<br />\nfrom Associated Press news<br />\nbulletings was laid in. In fact,<br />\nAP was one of the forces behind<br />\nthe planning and publishing of<br />\n444 Days--Associated Press, one<br />\nof the two great news organs of<br />\nthis country. The hostages were<br />\nreleased on day 444, the book<br />\non day 452. The book was so<br />\nstructured that no matter what<br />\nday the hostages were released,<br />\nthe book would have appeared<br />\nexactly eight days after their<br />\nliberation. Every day, a production staff methodically laid<br />\nin the day's news, in anticipation<br />\nof the hostages' release or<br />\ndeath...At the end of the book, a<br />\nphoto and a brief biographical<br />\nblurb is given for each of the<br />\nhostages. A quote from the Day<br />\n1 entry: \"It was an ordinary<br />\nday in Teheran...\" 444 Days is<br />\nnot, unfortunately, an isolated<br />\nabhorrence--it is the herald of a<br />\nhorde of printed matter on the<br />\nhostage crisis yet to come.<br />\nI realize that there are laws<br />\ninsuring freedom of speech for<br />\nthe American media, but it<br />\nis unfortunate that it is impossible to construct laws insuring<br />\nthat the media use some tact.<br />\nCan you imagine what it must<br />\nfeel like to be an ex-hostage?<br />\nHunted by the press, people<br />\npointing you out in public<br />\nbecause of some stupid goddam<br />\nbook sold throughout the whole<br />\ncountry...

Again,<br />\nthese articles are harmless in and<br />\nof themselves, but they reflect a<br />\ngut-reaction nationalism which<br />\nhas pervaded our country for the<br />\npast year and a half. Only once<br />\ndid the media attempt to enlighten the public as to the<br />\nnature of the Islamic world and<br />\npossible motivations behind such<br />\nan apparently rash action as the<br />\nembassy take-over: Death of a<br />\nPrincess, a controversial movie<br />\non PBS which suffered the hex<br />\nof all public television shows,<br />\na relatively miniscule audience.<br />\nDemocracy is the voice of the<br />\npeople, and the vox populi<br />\nis saying \"GruntsnarlkillthegoddamIranians!\"<br />\nThe hostage crisis did not<br />\nteach us that national pride is a<br />\nsacred and beautiful 'thing. On<br />\nthe contrary, it showed that<br />\nAmerican national pride is an<br />\nunthinking brute, and that via<br />\nour media we are experts at<br />\nself-parody.<br />\n<br />\nparadoxical that the President,<br />\nthe most powerful holder of a<br />\nsingle office in the United States<br />\nand therefore the necessary<br />\nfocus of scrutiny by the media,<br />\nis given a grace period by the<br />\npress, but the ex-hostages, just<br />\nreturning from a year and a half<br />\nof psychological pressure, are<br />\nnot allowed to escape the manic<br />\nattention of the public eye.

The students, brought together by Neil<br />\nSmith, a graduate student in<br />\nGeography, and by undergraduates Joel Ferber and Mike<br />\n<br />\nBraverman, have already spoken<br />\n<br />\nwith Associate Dean Joseph<br />\nHall, and will be meeting on<br />\nMonday with University vicepresident Robert C.

Professors and students have expressed<br />\nconcern about getting books on<br />\ntime and finding ways to obtain<br />\nthe books quickly should the<br />\nstore run out or the order not<br />\narrive. Several of the bidders<br />\neither had very large warehouses<br />\nor said they were willing to get<br />\nthem from other sources, which<br />\ncommittee members believe<br />\nwould be much quicker than the<br />\ncurrent 2-3 week wait.<br />\nTextbook return rules are<br />\nanother important consideration. Books are now bought<br />\nback on a sliding scale according<br />\nto the condition, ranging from<br />\n25 to 50 percent of the original<br />\nvalue, and are sold at 75 percent<br />\nof original value regardless of<br />\ncondition. The new guidelines<br />\nallow the bookstore to mark up<br />\nthe price of used books only 25<br />\npercent above the buy-back cost.<br />\nThe committee also considered the store's layout, financial questions, management efficiency, and ways of meeting the<br />\nneeds of night students.<br />\nAuxiliary Services director<br />\n<br />\nRapist<br />\nIt has been reported to the<br />\nNews-Letter that a rapist is<br />\npresently at large in Charles<br />\nVillage.

The three most popular<br />\nproposals were: \"The United<br />\nStates and the World: How<br />\nDeep is the Commitment?\"<br />\n\"The Crossroads of the 80's:<br />\nWhich Way Should America<br />\nTurn?\" and \"America and the<br />\nImmigrant Experience.\" The<br />\nvoting turnout was 191, which<br />\nSmith said was comparable to<br />\nthat of last year's referendum.<br />\nThe Committee on Committees<br />\n<br />\nwill now review the three<br />\nproposals and decide the Symposium topic.<br />\nSmith then proposed that<br />\nelections for Young Trustee,<br />\nStudent Council executive officers, and class officers all take<br />\nplace March 10. SC President<br />\nSteele protested having all of<br />\nthese elections take place on one<br />\ndate for various reasons. First,<br />\nSteele contended that February<br />\n23 is too early to expect petitions to be completed by candidates for both Student Council<br />\nand class offices.<br />\nSeveral SC members agreed<br />\nwith Steele.<br />\nTrip Gulick,<br />\npresident of the Class of 1982,<br />\nmaintained that an early election<br />\nwould impede old officers and<br />\n\"create a great deal of unnecessary friction between two groups<br />\nof elected class officers if the<br />\noverlap lasted for as long as one<br />\nand a half months.\" Bill Dean,<br />\npresident of the Class of 1981,<br />\nprotested Smith's proposal because he claimed that it would<br />\nreduce the field to the \"unfortunately small group who undertake almost all the leadership<br />\nactivities in any one class.\"<br />\nSteele noted that separate<br />\nelection dates for Student Council officers and class officers<br />\nwould allow a student to attempt a second elected office if<br />\nhe lost his first election. Smith<br />\ndisagreed, maintaining if all of<br />\n<br />\nthe elections were held on one day<br />\nstudents would be more inclined<br />\nto vote. Steele disputed Smith's<br />\n:ontention, citing last year's<br />\ntoter turnout of more than 50%.<br />\nSmith finally acceded when<br />\nSteele argued that he would have<br />\nto follow the guidelines of the<br />\nold constitution to break this<br />\nimpass since there is not yet a<br />\nnew constitution that addresses<br />\nthe problem of setting election<br />\ndates.<br />\nChuck Peifer, Undergraduate Representative to CUS,<br />\nthen presented the Council with<br />\nseveral possible proposals by the<br />\nCommittee of Undergraduate<br />\nStudies (CUS), an advisory<br />\nboard to the Academic Council<br />\nwhich makes proposals in the<br />\narea of academic studies.

The<br />\nFRCR proposals, as amended by the CUS, are<br />\nbeing forwarded to the Academic Council for<br />\nfinal approval.<br />\nSo why would.; you, a Hopkins undergrad<br />\nwith God knows enough to worry about as it is,<br />\ncare about what the CUS and Academic Council<br />\nare doing with some inane report?<br />\nIt's simple--it's gonna get you, right where<br />\nyou live, and don't you think different. Would<br />\nyou like to have only three weeks to add and<br />\ndrop courses? Would you like all two hour per<br />\nweek courses to receive only two credits?<br />\nWould you like to find out a little more about<br />\nthe FCRC report?<br />\nBack in November of 1978, the Academic<br />\nCouncil asked Dean Owen to put together a<br />\ncommittee to study undergraduate and graduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins. This committee, known<br />\nas the FCRC, was composed at any one time of<br />\ntwo<br />\nfive professors, one graduate student,<br />\nundergraduates, and two members of the Dean's Office.<br />\nThe FCRC met throughout 1979 and<br />\ndelivered its final report and recommendations--all sixteen pages of them including the appendix\u2014to Dean Owen in December, 1979. Owen<br />\nthen referred the report to the CUS, an advisory<br />\nsubcommittee of the Academic Council consisting of both faculty and undergraduates, which<br />\nis presently deliberating it.<br />\nAlthough the FCRC report was to deal<br />\nwith both undergraduate and graduate programs,<br />\nthe committee found \"no pressing matters<br />\nconcerning academic aspects of Graduate<br />\nprograms\" which warranted attention; consequently, all the report's recommendations concern undergraduate education.<br />\nTHE ADD/DROP DATE<br />\nLet's get back to the add/drop date and<br />\nthe deal about course hours/credits. The eightweek add/drop date creates problems in lab<br />\ncourses. \"We have such a liberal add/drop date<br />\nthat some students will sign up for a course and<br />\nwill take it for six weeks or eight weeks, then<br />\nthey'll drop it and sign up for it the following<br />\nsemester for the sole purpose of improving their<br />\ngrade\u2014it's like a dry run,\" explained Dean<br />\nMichael Hooker in an interview with the NewsLetter this week. \"This happens more in labs<br />\nthan anyplace else because it's in labs that this<br />\nkind of dry run experience will enhance your<br />\nchances of getting a good grade the second time<br />\naround.\"<br />\nTo prevent such abuses, the FCRC recommended adoption of a three-week add/drop<br />\ndate. The CUS took up the matter at its January 27 meeting this year. At its next meeting,<br />\nto be held March 3,Chuck Peifer,one of the four<br />\nvoting undergraduates on the CUS, will introduce a motion designed to amend the proposed three week limit. \"To keep that flexibility for students to be able to drop up to eight<br />\nweeks into the semester, but in order to cut<br />\ndown on the number of drop slips coming<br />\naround, the changes in programs, and the<br />\nproblems that creates for the Registrar's Office,<br />\nI'm proposing that every add/drop slip be signed<br />\nby the student's advisor,\" said Peifer in an<br />\ninterview this Tuesday. \"It's possible now for a<br />\nstudent to go to his advisor and sign up for<br />\nfive courses and then by the use of add/drops<br />\nchange that list completely from what it was<br />\noriginally intended to be. The fact that people<br />\nwill have to go see their advisors to get anything<br />\nchanged will result in less arbitrary course<br />\nselection. I see this as a compromise. I don't<br />\nthink it's the ideal situation;!\u2022 would prefer to<br />\nkeep the add/drop dates as they are.\"<br />\nPeifer also commented on other views<br />\nexpressed during the January 27 meeting.<br />\n\"Some professors do not like students dropping<br />\ncourses after they've begun because if you have<br />\na small seminar and you structure your course so<br />\nas to allow participation from each member, and<br />\none person drops out, commonly you'll have<br />\ngaps in the course. They would like to see the<br />\ninstructor's permission required to drop a course<br />\nafter three weeks as well as an advisor's. Now<br />\nthat I'm not too sure about. I mean that is<br />\n<br />\nChuck Peifer, one of CUS voting undergraduates,<br />\nputting so many restrictions on a student's<br />\nschedule that it sort of cements them in.\"<br />\nAnother possibility, which will be formally proposed at the next CUS meeting by<br />\nProfessor Patrick Moran (Mechanics), is to keep<br />\nthe present add date, make the drop date six<br />\nweeks after classes begin (instead of the present<br />\neight), and require advisors' signatures on all<br />\nadd/drop slips after the third week of classes.<br />\nPeifer's proposal leaves the drop date<br />\nintact and might serve to increase the rapport<br />\nbetween you and your advisor--but it's definitely<br />\ngoing to be a little less convenient and let's face<br />\nit\u2014some people don't even like going to see their<br />\nadvisors. I don't know how you feel about<br />\nneeding the prors permission to get out of a<br />\ncourse but I'm less than ecstatic. Moran's<br />\nsuggestion is a compromise between proposals<br />\nthat doesn't address the purported problems. If<br />\nit's true, as is claimed, that the Registrar's Office<br />\nis fouling up transcripts because of a deluge of<br />\nadd/drop slips at the beginning of a term,<br />\nallowing add/drops to proceed as usual during<br />\nthose first crucial weeks will hardly help.<br />\nIt seems reasonable that if late drops in<br />\nlab courses are the problem, then the date<br />\nshould be adjusted solely for those courses.<br />\nOther approaches geared towards making things<br />\neasier for the Registrar's Office at the expense<br />\nundergraduates seem a confu sion of<br />\nof<br />\npriorities.<br />\nCOURSE HOURS/CREDITS<br />\nIt's common knowledge that N, E, and Q<br />\ncourses generally stay much clgser to the one<br />\nhour one credit rule which is supposedly applied<br />\ncampus-wide than do H and S courses. Using<br />\nthe University's criteria referred to on page 3 of<br />\nthe FCRC report (each three credit course<br />\nshould require a minimum of 9 hours/week of<br />\nwork\u2014three in and six outside of class), it seems<br />\nclear that a good many N and E lab courses are<br />\nin fact undercredited.<br />\nThe FCRC recommends that \"each<br />\ndepartment should evaluate all 1 to 399 courses<br />\nto determine if a discrepancy exists between<br />\n:<br />\ncourse contact hours and allotted credit hours.<br />\nIn cases of discrepancies...three avenues are<br />\navailable for resolution of apparent conflicts:<br />\n(a) justification for a discrepancy between<br />\ncontact hours and credit hours should be explicitly stated both in the Catalog and in the<br />\nSchedule of Courses,(b) decrease in the number<br />\nof credits now allotted (see Appendix I for some<br />\npossible examples), and (c) increase in actual<br />\ncontact hours without increased outside workload in order to meet the criterion specified<br />\nabove.\" The \"Appendix I\" referred to is certainly enlightening as regards what might happen<br />\nif this recommendation becomes policy. Almost<br />\nevery course listed takes a credit cut; some<br />\ncourses are rendered absolutely inexpedient.<br />\n<br />\n\fPhilip Curtin's \"World and the West\" course<br />\n(80.330) would be reduced to 2 credits, for<br />\nexample; \"Integrated Circuits and Microprocessor Lab\" (54.49) would go the same route.<br />\nTo be sure, the FCRC noted that Appendix I<br />\nconsists only of possible course discrepancies;<br />\nboth these courses would probably remain at<br />\nthree credits under the first avenue for resolving<br />\nThe question now<br />\napparent discrepancies.<br />\nbecomes one of whether the faculty would decrease credits (without decreasing workload?) or<br />\nincrease contact hours without increasing<br />\noutside workload. I, for one, am not all that<br />\nanxious to see what would happen. My fear is<br />\nthat many, many courses especially in the H and<br />\nS areas, would be offered for less credit if this<br />\nrecommendation is adopted. How would you<br />\nlike to be taking 7 or 8 two credit courses next<br />\nsemester?<br />\nFortunately, the course hours/credits<br />\nequivalence recommended by the FCRC probably won't be approved by the CUS. \"I don't<br />\nthink that the one hour/one credit will pass<br />\nCUS, but I think that the CUS will probably go<br />\non record as recommending that the Dean<br />\ntighten up on credit allocation.\" said Dean<br />\nHooker. \"I don't think that they will recommend that we go to one hour/one credit because<br />\nit's unacceptable.\"<br />\nSo why dredge up the issue at all? Because it yields a little lesson about University<br />\npolitics. While it's true that the hours/credits<br />\nequivalence controversy will probably be resolved in favor of the undergrads, this will be as<br />\nmuch accident as design. Faculty concern<br />\nabout Homewood House encroachment in a<br />\ntraditionally departmental prerogative (setting<br />\ncourse credits) figures at least as largely as<br />\nconcern for the welfare of undergrads in the<br />\nwidespread condemnation of this proposal.<br />\n<br />\nthe FCRC reported that \"the Intersession<br />\nsupplies a number of useful activities which<br />\ndefinitely should be made available to Undergraduates annually during the appropriate<br />\nJanuary interval. Important activities currently<br />\ninclude School of Hygiene courses that are<br />\nrequired of some students, Engineering practice,<br />\nand independent research. On the other hand,<br />\nthe Faculty Curriculum Review Committee finds<br />\nthat the Intersession never has fulfilled expectations as a period of high innovation and<br />\nintellectual stimulation for the majority of<br />\nHopkins Undergraduates. Rather than a highpoint in the Undergraduate curriculum, the<br />\nIntersession has attracted minimal effort except<br />\nperhaps by graduate students in the Psychology<br />\nTotal offerings, content, and<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nenrollment have dwindled over the past few<br />\nyears. Members of the Faculty Curriculum<br />\nReview Committee agree unanimously that steps<br />\nshould be taken which will not only allow<br />\nretention of the Intersession but also strengthen<br />\nit into a training period of significance and<br />\nworthy of this University.\"<br />\nIs Intersession viable? A glance at enrollover the last five years suggests<br />\nstatistics<br />\nment<br />\nthat undergraduate interest in Intersession<br />\ncourses is high. As shown by the graph, Intersession enrollment is almost directly proportional to the number of courses offered. The<br />\nproblem with Intersession is not lack of student<br />\ninterest, but rather its present structure. InterInterses.Nion Enrollment vs<br />\nnumber drowse offerings,:977-81<br />\n'7<br />\n<br />\nINDEPENDENT STUDY GRADING<br />\nThe FCRC also dealt with the grading of<br />\nIndependent Study, research, and internships .<br />\nThe committee recommended that \"all research<br />\nand independent work should be credited<br />\ntoward the degree but not assigned a grade, i.e.<br />\nlisted as \"CR\" on the transcript.\" After debate<br />\non the issue spanning both its November and<br />\nDecember meetings, the CUS passed a motion<br />\nstating that independent research and internships will receive a P grade if passed (which<br />\nwon't compute into the GPA), and an F if failed<br />\n(which will compute into the GPA). Transcripts<br />\nwill note that independent research and internships are so graded. Faculty sponsors of research and internships will be required to write<br />\nletters of appraisal for the student's record, to<br />\nbe used in applications to med schools, law<br />\nschools, graduate schools, etc. Independent<br />\nStudy will continue to be graded as it presently<br />\nis.<br />\nThe Academic Council did not altogether<br />\napprove of the CUS's motion. \"The Academic<br />\nCouncil passed it with a recommendation back<br />\nto the CUS that the F not compute into the<br />\nGPA,\" explained Dean Hooker. \"...The Academic Council apparently thought that it was<br />\nunfair for the F to compute into the GPA but<br />\nfor the P not to do so.\"<br />\nAt its meeting of January 27, the CUS<br />\nvoted to recommend to the Academic Council<br />\nthat it reconsider its decision. \"As it presently is<br />\nin pass/fail courses, the pass doesn't help the<br />\nGPA, but the F adversely affects it...so it [the<br />\nproposed research/internship grading] would be<br />\nan inconsistency,\" commented Dean Hooker.<br />\n\"The CUS was not sure that the Academic<br />\nCouncil actually 'considered that inconsistency.<br />\nAt least the CUS wants to bring it to their<br />\nattention to give them the opportunity to decide<br />\nwhether they want to go on record as being in<br />\nfavor of this inconsistency. It remains to be<br />\nseen, then, what will happen.\"<br />\n<br />\n'79<br />\n<br />\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80<br />\nnumber of different coarse offerin s<br />\n<br />\nof their<br />\ncourse<br />\nexperiment with a new<br />\nunderour<br />\nfor<br />\nstimulating<br />\nbe<br />\nshould<br />\nown.

I would also like to see more of the<br />\nfaculty teach Intersession courses, but only if<br />\nthey want to. I wouldn't want them to feel<br />\nunder duress to do it.\"<br />\nThe FCRC recommended that a nineperson Committee on the Intersession be appointed for three years, consisting of three<br />\nfaculty members, three undergrads, two grads,<br />\nand one postdoctoral student. The Associate<br />\nDean for Undergraduate and Graduate Studies,<br />\nwho would make the appointments to the<br />\ncommittee, and the Director of Advising and<br />\nCounseling would be included as ex officio<br />\nmembers.<br />\nWhat should be realized about this proposed committee is that even though it is given a<br />\nlong list of functions on page 7 of the FCRC<br />\nreport (appraise on-going Intersession activities,<br />\nseek improvements in programming, etc.), in<br />\nfact the committee will do nothing, not from<br />\nlack of trying but because given the University<br />\npower structure there's almost nothing that it<br />\ncan do. This doesn't necessarily mean that the<br />\nproposal shouldn't be supported by the undergraduate community when it is taken up by the<br />\nCUS. It probably should be supported as an<br />\nembodified commitment of the University to a<br />\nstronger Intersession.<br />\nCONCLUSION<br />\nFour of the FCRC's most important<br />\nrecommendations have been discussed above;<br />\nthis by no means exhausts the significance of the<br />\nreport for undergraduates (for example, the<br />\nFCRC urges the adoption of plus/minus<br />\ngrading). This article cannot detail every proposal the FCRC made, nor should it have to.<br />\nThe Student's Council, with the close cooperation of the undergraduate representatives on<br />\nthe CUS, should be working every week to<br />\ninsure that the student body is well-informed as<br />\nto the FCRC report's progress in the CUS' As a<br />\nstart, free copies of the FCRC report should be<br />\nmade easily available to students.<br />\nChuck Peiffer, Stuart Stahl, John Ragheb,<br />\nMichael Steele, and David Freidman(an alternate)<br />\nare our undergraduate representatives on the<br />\nCUS' Together they wield four votes out of a<br />\ntotal of ten in the CUS; they can and do influence the committee's decisions.<br />\nThe Academic Council, the body which<br />\nactually sets University policy, is beyond the<br />\nHowever, the<br />\nrange of student influence.<br />\nAcademic Council will consider and implement<br />\nthe FCRC's recommendations only as reviewed<br />\nand amended by the CUS. We can and must<br />\nmake our weight felt in the CUS\u2014to do anything<br />\nless with the entire tenor of undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins at stake would be letting<br />\nourselves down.<br />\n<br />\nsession is exceedingly informal. Professors who<br />\nwish to teach Intersession courses, generally<br />\nbecause it would aid them in a facet of their<br />\nresearch or allow them to test-run a new course,<br />\ndo so; those who prefer to have a full month of<br />\nvacation or free time to pursue their researches<br />\ndo not. Thus, Intersession as a whole is the sum<br />\ntotal of decisions made individually by each<br />\nfaculty member as to whether her or she will<br />\nteach a course. It has never been University<br />\npolicy that each department has to offer Inter\u2014<br />\nsession courses; given the power structure of the<br />\nUniversity, such a directive would be impossible.<br />\nPower at Hopkins resides at the level of the<br />\nindividual professor; the deans, and to a lesser<br />\nextent even the department chairmen, cannot<br />\nforce the professors to do anything.<br />\nNonetheless, there was some success this<br />\nyear in beefing up Intersession: the number of<br />\ncourses offered increased from 37 in 1980 to 50<br />\nin 1981, while enrollments rose accordingly<br />\nfrom 332 to 465.<br />\nVarious plans have been suggested to<br />\nstrengthen Intersession. One possibility is to<br />\npay professors to teach during Intersession. This<br />\nwould undoubtedly increase course offerings but<br />\nundergrads would probably be charged extra<br />\ntuition to take Intersession courses.

What the viewing public<br />\nwitnesses now is no more than the usual<br />\nselection of boxing films--the smattering<br />\nof \"contendor\" pieces which have proven<br />\nsuch an American staple. Prizefighting is<br />\nvery much American, if only through<br />\nadoption, and film audiences have always<br />\nbeen willing to watch a down-and-outpalooka parlay childhood streetfighting<br />\ninto the bone-crushing fame and glory<br />\nof a championship bout.<br />\nAll this taken into account, one<br />\ncannot expect Raging Bull to usher in any<br />\nsort of film trend, since it follows in an<br />\nAmerican cinematic tradition. Just as<br />\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid<br />\nestablished the team of Redford and<br />\nNewman, but not a renaissance of westerns, Raging Bull will probably only<br />\nstrengthen star Robert DeNiro's career<br />\nand have little effect upon the station of<br />\nthe boxing film in American movie<br />\nhistory.<br />\nNevertheless, Raging Bull is a<br />\npowerful and innovative film. Boxer Jake<br />\nLaMotta is the focus, but the script treats<br />\nhis ring time as an aside, preferring to<br />\ndevelop the character as man rather than<br />\nas a sports legend. The bulk of the film<br />\ncatches snippets of LaMotta's deteriorating relationship with his brother/mana-<br />\n<br />\nger and the woman he marries after<br />\nditching his first wife. Essentially, Raging<br />\nBull is a character study. One can hardly<br />\nwonder at its success, with the reunion of<br />\nDeNiro and director Martin Scorsese<br />\nwhose collaboration in Taxi Driver<br />\nlaunched DeNiro's career.<br />\nportrays two Jake<br />\nDeNiro<br />\nLaMottas: the vicious palooka of the<br />\nboxing ring and a fat older man stumbling<br />\nthrough life in an attempt to mop up the<br />\nmistakes and recapture the glory of his<br />\nboxing days. The film opens in a dressing<br />\nroom, where the retired LaMotta rehearses a clumsy poem. Next, the camera<br />\nretreats in time, seeking out a boxing ring<br />\nwhere a young and wiry LaMotta polishes<br />\noff the first in a long line of champions.<br />\nThen, on to the grimy Bronx neighborhood and the turbulent domestic life of a<br />\nman perpetually driven to violence.<br />\nIt is not until the last half-hour that the<br />\naudience returns to that dressing room.<br />\nBy then, the film has traced the fighter's<br />\ncareer and the stormy consequences of<br />\nhis obsessive jealousy toward his wife.<br />\nLaMotta has turned away his brother, his<br />\nvoice of reason, he wades friendless<br />\nthrough the atrophying limbo of athletic<br />\nretirement. LaMotta is now a nightclub<br />\nentertainer, somewhat more tame than<br />\nhis younger self, but no less tragic.<br />\nDeNiro's performance is understated, yet inspiring, though the creative<br />\nchemistry between him and director<br />\nScorsese contributes to much of this<br />\nsuccess. There is an impressive depth<br />\nto the portrayal of Jake LaMotta, a rapid<br />\nidentification with the audience and a<br />\nclear pattern of behav'.or which, fortun-<br />\n<br />\nately, does not lapse into the predictable.<br />\nDirector and actor play the weary entertainer against the boxer beautifully. This,<br />\nperhaps, is pivotal to this character<br />\nstudy, as the transition from sports to<br />\nretirement is the most telling of an<br />\nathlete.<br />\nRaging Bull is technically ingenious. Director Scorsese chose a blackand-white format to instill realism and<br />\ntone down the gory dynamics of the<br />\nbloodletting fight sequences. He uses<br />\nseveral elements of the \"documentary<br />\nstyle.\" The camera roves through the<br />\naction with frenzied immediacy, switching to slow motion when the audience<br />\nmust concentrate on certain scenes. This<br />\nparticular tack works well. The contemporary viewer is so used to the visual<br />\nexcitement of color films that more than<br />\nan hour of black and white will lull him<br />\n<br />\nLive Werewolf<br />\n<br />\nir 51<br />\n<br />\nWarren Howls Again<br />\nBY DAN VITALE<br />\nWarren Zevon's Stand in the<br />\nFire ambles into this season's ghost-town<br />\nof live-album releases like a desperado<br />\ngorilla at high noon. Recorded at L.A.'s<br />\nRoxy Theater in the spring of 1980,<br />\nStand in the Fire hit the stores at the tail<br />\nend of a Christmas season concert record<br />\nglut that included alarmingly feeble<br />\nefforts by such heavyweights as Heart,<br />\nthe Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and Supertramp. Zevon, hardly a \"big name,\" has<br />\noutdone them all, producing two sides of<br />\nrelentless rock and roll with the assistance<br />\nof a tighter, harsher line-up of background musicians than has appeared on<br />\nany of his previous studio albums.<br />\nZevon, who is probably bestknown for his 1978 album Excitable Boy,<br />\n<br />\nKandinskyWatercolors On Display<br />\nBY MARK SKONER<br />\nWassily Kandinsky is often described as the first abstract painter. More<br />\nthan any other painter, with the possible<br />\nexception of Piet Mondrian, he is identified with the transition from representational to abstract art. Fifty Kandinsky<br />\nwatercolors are on display at the Baltimore Museum through March 1. The<br />\nselection represents only a fraction of<br />\nKandinsky's work in watercolor, but it<br />\nincludes paintings from every phase of his<br />\ncareer, and affords a modest overview of<br />\nthe artist's development.<br />\nKandinsky was interested in theosophy and the relation between material<br />\nsubstance and ethereal essence. This<br />\ninterest was the impetus behind many of<br />\nhis early abstractions. What we witness in<br />\nthese paintings is the disintegration of the<br />\nnexus between form and color so that<br />\ncolor floats free of form, while the<br />\ndiscarded form is left with a substanceless<br />\nlife of its own. Color and line interpenetrate and separate as they move across the<br />\ncanvas in a state of flux, looking as if in<br />\nsome former existence they had been<br />\ncombined to present a solid object.<br />\nAlthough lines do establish forms, many<br />\nwander freely around the erupting<br />\n<br />\nlandscape as objects of interest in themselves--black, thick, and vibrant.<br />\nSometimes Kandinsky uses color<br />\nso that it emanates from line alone, as if<br />\nsubstance and form had disintegrated and<br />\nbeen subsumed, as color, into the quality<br />\nof the lines. Black lines emerge from<br />\nstreaks of dark color, suggesting that the<br />\nblack has dissolved into its own manifold<br />\ncolor components-the color appears to<br />\nburn through from the very center of the<br />\nblack.<br />\n<br />\nor her into detachment. The use of slow<br />\nmotion grabs the audience and, through<br />\nconvention, creates the illusion that they<br />\nview the action through another's point<br />\nof view--namely, that of Jake LaMotta.<br />\nUnfortunately, Raging Bull is<br />\ntedious. Many scenes run too long and<br />\ncertain points are overstated. Despite the<br />\nperformances and Scorsese's variety in<br />\ntechnique, it is easy to tire of the film,<br />\nespecially in the last fifteen minutes.<br />\nHowever, the film will enthrall boxing<br />\nfans, as well as devotees of the characterstudy genre. Raging Bull does not make<br />\nfor an evening of light entertainment. Its<br />\nhumor is grotesque; its tone, somewhat<br />\noppressive and heavy. Though it deserves<br />\nthe nomination,Raging Bull is exhausting<br />\ncinema, requiring a certain frame of<br />\nmind from the viewer. See it, yes, but<br />\nexpect to become involved.<br />\n<br />\nWhile Kandinsky's early watercolors are amorphous and chaotic, works<br />\nfrom the 1920s (when he was a member<br />\nof the Bauhaus) are very geometrical,<br />\nmore severe and lucid, and often more<br />\ngraphic than pictorial. Nevertheless, they<br />\nretain a spontaneous quality and iconographic complexity which set them apart<br />\nfrom other artists' geometric abstractions<br />\nof the same period. These paintings use<br />\ncolor sparingly. They are filled with<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\nhas freed himself from the slightly<br />\nmellow musicianship which characterized<br />\nthat album and the one prior to it,<br />\nBoth were<br />\n1976's Warren Zevon.<br />\nproduced in whole or in part by Zevon's<br />\nmentor, Jackson Browne. This change,<br />\nhinted at in the self-produced Bad Luck<br />\nStreak in Dancing School of early 1980,<br />\nemerges fully in concert, and is captured<br />\nperfectly on Stand in the Fire. If anything, the new style only serves to amplify the strength of Zevon's lyrics, which<br />\nhave never been exactly mild, to say the<br />\nleast. The gritty cynicism and deadly<br />\nplayfulness of his songs, powerful enough<br />\nin the studio, bursts forth with a vengeance onstage.<br />\nThe album opens with \"Stand in<br />\nthe Fire,\" a statement of Zevon's theory<br />\nof performing-that of musician as<br />\ntightrope walker. The ominous yet<br />\nmischevous tone of the song acknowledges the challenge of doing battle<br />\nwith one's rock and roll demons night<br />\nafter night without denying the sheer<br />\nexhilaration that results from it. This<br />\nphilosophy resonates like thunder<br />\nthroughout the ,album.<br />\nIn \"Jeannie Needs a Shooter,\"<br />\nco-written with Bruce Springsteen, the<br />\nout-in-the-street-and-down-by-familiar<br />\nthe-river-with-my-girl concerns so prevalent in Springsteen's work are given a<br />\nsharper edge with the addition of Zevon's<br />\nfatalistic ideas about romance and his<br />\nIn<br />\npenchant for nasty plot twists.<br />\n\"Excitable Boy,\" the aberrant actions of<br />\na mildly disturbed youth are set of nicely<br />\nwith fifties-style \"ooh-wah-ooh\" harmonies, leaping piano countermelodies,<br />\nand the constant straightfaced disclaimer:<br />\n\"He's just an excitable boy.\" In \"Werewolves of London,\" Zevon uses the<br />\nopportunity offered by the in-concert<br />\natmosphere to add extra bite to the<br />\nby-now trademark werewolf howls,<br />\nand to take potshots at popular culture<br />\nby injecting reterences to Jackson<br />\nBrowne, used cars, James Taylor, Perrier,<br />\nwherever<br />\nDePalma<br />\nBrian<br />\nand<br />\nappropriate;while the maniacal phrasings<br />\nemployed in \"Lawyers, Guns, and<br />\nMoney\" render the plight of a not-soinnocent abroad even more desperately than on the studio version.<br />\nZevon does have a softer side,<br />\nhowever, although it is not as apparent on<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br />\n<br />\n\fFEBRUARY 6,1981 / PAGE 14<br />\n<br />\nBoscoe the Cineaste's February Pix<br />\nConservatives have seen it as a monument<br />\nto a great figure of American history; the<br />\nleftists have seen it as the portrayal of a<br />\ntrue lunatic.

Starting off with \"Poor Poor \"He's just an excitable boy.\"<br />\nPitiful Me,\" Zevon delivers the definitive<br />\nperformance of a song usually associated<br />\nwith Linda Ronstadt. His 1976 studio<br />\nversion outdid Ronstadt's by a long shot<br />\nanyway, but onstage he blows her away<br />\nonce and for all, affirming (just in case<br />\nanyone forgot) that this raucous<br />\nfear-and-loathing- in-LA parable is undeniably his own.<br />\nNext he moves on to \"I'll Sleep<br />\nWhen I'm Dead,\" a hammering piece of<br />\nSaturday night hell-raising given new life<br />\nby the frenetic riffs of former Carolyne<br />\nMas guitarist David Landau and a few<br />\nnew lyrics: the .38 special Zevon once<br />\nplanned to shoot himself with is here<br />\ntransformed into a .44 magnum with the<br />\nbarrel unquestioningly pointed in the<br />\nother direction. Finally the band exits in<br />\nrave-worthy fashion with some classic<br />\nbop music\u2014a medley consisting of \"Bo<br />\nDiddley\" and \"Bo Diddley's a Gunslinger\"\u2014and Zevon rises feverishly to the<br />\noccasion, sounding like a cross between<br />\nBuddy Holly and a TV wrestler. After<br />\n<br />\nKandinsky Watercolor<br />\ncont. from p. 13<br />\nsharp lines and angles, checkered areas,<br />\ncircles, triangles, curves, distorted ovals<br />\nand trapezoids. Elements overlap and<br />\nstand in formation side by side, lines<br />\ncrisscross and veer off into zigzag<br />\nthickets, acute angles chop semicircles<br />\ninto arabesques. In Bright Sound two<br />\nstalks snap forward from a translucent<br />\nyellow triangle, sweeping chips of color<br />\ninto random parquet and leaving in their<br />\nwake a barely balanced structure, here<br />\nand there points of invisible intersection,<br />\nand staves tumbling over screened-off<br />\nyellow glow.<br />\nOn Violet, Free Relationship, and<br />\nDaybreak are some of the amazing<br />\nwatercolors which epitomize Kandinsky':<br />\nmost distinctive style. These works seerrto exude tension: tension between exact<br />\nand inexact, complete and fragmented<br />\nforms; between main forms and constellations of miscellaneous elements. It is<br />\nimpossible to tell whether a picture is on<br />\nthe verge of integration or in the process<br />\nof explosion.<br />\nKandinsky rejected the notion<br />\nthat abstract painting must confine itself<br />\nto a single picture plane. His paintings<br />\nestablish a uniquely ambiguous space-sometimes shallow, sometimes naturalistic. Forms spread out over a homogenous plane, and we are not impelled to see<br />\nan illusory space around objects, yet we<br />\ndo not see one single surface either.<br />\nKandinsky uses visual clues, such as<br />\nshading and convergent lines, in contradictory ways. Colors play against each<br />\nother and against linear forms so that<br />\nelements of the picture appear to be<br />\nfloating freely in some \"new\" space.<br />\nKandinsky's paintings are particularly susceptible to interpretation as<br />\nrealistic scenes: \"The triangle looks like a<br />\nman, the circle is a sun,\" and so forth.<br />\nIndeed, there are many forms which<br />\ndemand to be read in realistic terms, and<br />\nwhich Kandinsky must have included<br />\ndeliberately. For example, On Violet<br />\nlooks like ,a surrealistic cartoon: a boat<br />\nchugs uphill past a huge hair, towards a<br />\n<br />\nbridge. But even when there are no<br />\nexplicit resemblances, the geometrical<br />\npaintings seem to imply a reality through<br />\nsheer expressive energy. This is because<br />\nmost of the forms derive from objects in<br />\nthe world. Kandinsky's abstractional<br />\nmethod puts images from his own visual<br />\nexperience through a sieve. For him the<br />\nimportant thing was that the object lose<br />\nits identity as a concrete fixture of the<br />\nworld with a certain material function;<br />\nthen a viewer might concentrate on the<br />\nway it looks rather than on what it is.<br />\nKandinsky employed circles, triangles,<br />\nand squares, and separated line and color<br />\nnot in order to present these things as<br />\n\"pure\" entities in their own right, but to<br />\nconcentrate with great specificity one<br />\naspect of an image while reducing and<br />\nfiltering out others.<br />\nKandinsky's late- and postBauhaus watercolors reveal increasingly<br />\nsophisticated technique.<br />\nWatercolor<br />\nmists applied with an atomizer, spatters,<br />\nand multiple washes contribute to simpler<br />\ncompositions which rely more on color.<br />\nThroughout the 1930s Kandinsky's work<br />\nbecomes much more controlled and<br />\nsimplified\u2014the explosive detail so characteristic of his Bauhaus watercolors<br />\ndisappears. Finally, in the 1940s, his<br />\npaintings acquire a biomorphic quality, as<br />\nwell as renewed complexity.<br />\nKandinsky's paintings renounce<br />\nties with the visible, but not ties with<br />\nreality.

The<br />\nsquad, which now consists of 12<br />\nswimmers and two divers, picked<br />\nup its most recent victory last<br />\nweekend over Franklin and<br />\nMarshall as the Jays came out<br />\nahead, 59-45.<br />\nIn earlier action, the JHU<br />\nwomen scored a key victory over<br />\nTowson State, defeating the<br />\nTigers for the first time in four<br />\nyears, this time by a score of<br />\n76-62.<br />\nIn addition to their impressive record, the Jays have<br />\nsucceeded in qualifying five<br />\nteam members in thirteen<br />\nnational events. Sophomores<br />\nAnn Aronowitz and Tracey<br />\nSmith, senior Monika Bay,<br />\nfreshman Heather Dick, and<br />\ndiver Tracey Stambaugh will all<br />\ntravel to Coe College in Cedar<br />\nRapids, Iowa to compete in the<br />\nAIAW Division III Nationals<br />\nduring the weekend of March<br />\n<br />\n12. The women may qualify<br />\nseveral more, including the constantly improving junior diver<br />\nLee Anne Faulkner.<br />\nThis year the Jays are<br />\nblessed with a strong performance by a freshman, Heather<br />\nDick. Dick has led the Jays in<br />\nthe freestyle competition, and<br />\nwith Bay has managed to wrap<br />\nup the top national times in the<br />\n200, 500, and 1000 meter<br />\nfreestyle. The combination of<br />\nDick, Smith, Bay, and Aronowitz has also captured a Division<br />\nIII spot for their performance in<br />\nthe 800 free relay, turining in a<br />\ntime of 8:25.55.<br />\nIn other events, both Bay<br />\nand Aronowitz have qualified in<br />\nboth the 400 individual- medley,<br />\nwith times of 4:49.64 and<br />\n4:58.83, respectively; and in the<br />\n200 meter butterfly, with times<br />\nof 2:16.21 and 2:18.97.<br />\nThe Hopkins women swim<br />\nagainst American U., Maryland,<br />\nand George Washington before<br />\nthey travel to Widener during<br />\nthe closing weekend of February<br />\nto compete in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference (MAC)<br />\nchampionships.

Also, dogs<br />\nwould no longer be allowed in<br />\nany University building, includThe new<br />\ning apartments.<br />\nregulation took effect February<br />\n1,1981.<br /><br />\nJunior Ellen Kavee began a<br />\nprotest movement that resulted<br />\nin petitions that have now been<br />\nsigned by approximately 1200<br />\nstudents. The signers objected<br />\nto the manner in which the<br />\nAdministration went about developing and publicizing the new<br />\nrules. They suggested that a<br />\nstudent-administration discussion of<br />\nthe issue could create \"a better<br />\nsolution than a blanket ban.\"<br />\nKavee said that only 10<br />\npercent of the students approached to sign the petitions<br />\nrefused to get involved. More<br />\nthan 80% supported the protest;<br />\nsome were dog lovers, but others<br />\nsimply resented the University's<br />\napproach, she said.<br />\nKavee proposed the establishment of a student committee<br />\nto regulate dogs on campus.<br />\nAll dogs would be registered and<br /><br />\ntagged for a $2 fee. Complaints<br />\nagainst a specific dog could be<br />\nregistered with the committee,<br />\nwhich would decide upon the<br />\nappropriate disciplinary action<br />\n(including fines and/or loss of<br />\ncampus privileges).<br />\nKavee noted that when<br />\nDean Hall was first approached<br />\nwith the plan for a regulatory<br />\ncommittee, he discouraged it.<br />\nOne objection, Kavee believes,<br />\nwas the proposal that complaints<br />\nbe called in to the University.<br />\nswitchboard.<br />\nThe plan was<br />\nsubsequently modified to direct<br />\nthe calls to the Student Council<br />\noffice.<br />\nAt the Student Council<br />\nmeeting, President<br />\nMichael<br />\nSteele revealed that he had<br />\nspoken with Dean Owen about<br />\nthe problem. Owen conceded<br />\nthat the new policy was<br /><br />\n\"tough,\" said Steele.<br />\nCouncil members suggested<br />\nthat enforcement of the policy<br />\nbe delayed until September 1.<br />\nThis would give a student<br />\ncommittee time to investigate<br />\nthe problem, review policy, and<br />\nrecommend a course of action<br />\nthat would be \"fairer\" to all<br />\nconcerned.

The<br />\nrelease of the American hostages<br />\nwas no exception:<br />\nbefore<br />\nanyone had an opportunity to<br />\nform his or her own feelings<br />\nabout their freedom, the American media had already formed it<br />\nfor us. The offspring of each<br />\nnetwork's, newspaper's, and<br />\npublishing house's attempt to<br />\ntell us what personal significance<br />\nthis should have for each of us<br />\nbefore anyone else had the<br />\nchance to tell us what personal<br />\nsignificance this should have for<br />\neach of us has been just as crass<br />\nand ugly as usual.<br />\nThere is a branch of the<br />\npublishing business whose function is to follow every major<br /><br />\nnews event with a flood of<br />\nbooks informing the public of<br />\ninformation which is already<br />\ncommon knowledge. Most major<br />\npublishing houses hire task<br />\nforces of writers who are on<br />\nstand-by continuously for another major tragedy to explode<br />\non the evening news and then<br />\nget right down to writing a<br />\nbook on the subject.<br />\nFor<br />\nexample, the day that the<br />\nGuyana incident was announced,<br />\neach squad of writers was sent a<br />\nmanila envelope full of newspaper clippings, transcripts from<br />\ntelevision news, and still photographs.<br />\nThe writers locked<br />\nthemselves in seclusion for two<br />\ndays, churning out as much<br />\ncomprehensible regurgitation of<br />\nthe facts as possible, and handed<br />\nin completed manuscripts for a<br />\nfinal four books on the subject<br />\nto be released 5-10 days after<br />\nthe date of the massacre. The<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nSorry, No Fight This Time<br />\nThe firing of Marge Mareck, formerly a<br />\nsecretary at the University's Eisenhower<br />\nProject, has all the right ingredients for yet<br />\nanother Us vs. Them standoff. There is the<br />\nExploited Employee, whose only crime was<br />\nto ask for more money; there is the Administration, acting through its usual haze<br />\nof Official Blather; there are the Angry<br />\nStudents, demanding in sanctimonious<br />\nterms that the rights of the \"exploited' be<br />\nprotected; and there is even an Evil Employer, bad Dr. Galambos, spewing forth<br />\norders faster than anyone could take.<br />\nFortunately, one simple thing saves us<br />\nfrom such a confrontation--Mrs. Mareck<br />\nsimply doesn't have a case.<br />\nThe S500 pay increase she demanded<br />\nmay indeed have been merited; that is not<br />\nthe issue. There has to be a casual link<br />\nbetween her request and her firing for her<br />\nto claim an injustice\u2014and, unless someone<br />\nreally is hiding something, that link doesn't<br />\n9<br /><br />\nexist.<br />\nFor whatever reasons, working<br />\nrelations do deteriorate--something that<br />\nboth Mareck and Galambos acknowledge.<br />\nThose involved in the formation of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Employees Association<br />\nshould, however, be praised. There is no<br />\nreason to believe that this University, as an<br />\nemployer is any less generally mean and<br />\nrotten than anyone else. Rather than<br />\nharping about sporadic cases of perceived<br />\nwrongdoing, the Association seems willing<br />\nto work towards a better situation for<br />\nboth sides (and dropping the idea of<br />\n\"sides\" seems a useful place to start).<br />\nFor a group who supposedly wears their<br />\napathy like a badge, the students involved<br />\nin the case acted with a remarkable degree<br />\nof self-righteousness; they should remember that the final criterion should be a<br />\nmeasure of right or wrong action taken,<br />\nand not a measure of eloquent or angry<br />\nwords.<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editor<br />\nof WJHU is now geared solely to<br />\nthe interests of the outside<br />\ncommunity and not to the<br />\nstudents.

Thank you Mike Steele.<br />\nIra Lefkowitz<br />\nPresident, J.S.A<br />\nMatthew Whitehorn<br />\nVice President, J.S.A.<br /><br />\nDogs...<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe new regulation concerning the presence of dogs on<br />\ncampus indiscriminately prohibits several quite different types<br />\nof activities. In particular, in<br />\nputting an end to the practice<br />\nof leaving one's dog tied up to a<br />\ntree or building while one is<br />\ninside, it discriminates against<br />\nthose owners who use their<br />\nanimals as protective escorts<br />\nwhen walking to and from the<br />\nuniversity and around the campus itself.<br />\nThat this campus is not an<br />\nentirely safe place, especially for<br />\nan individual walking alone, and<br />\nthis despite the best efforts of<br />\nour security force, has been<br />\nbrought by students to the<br />\nadministration's attention during<br />\nthe past year. That this campus<br />\nand the areas which surround it<br />\nare especially unsafe for women<br />\nhas also been called to your<br />\nattention. Is there so little<br />\nregard for the welfare of the<br />\nfemale students at Hopkins that<br />\nit clouds vision on these matters<br />\nand allows you to forget our<br />\nneeds when you issue an order<br />\nthat dramatically affects us?<br />\nAs a woman, my freedom of<br />\nsafe and unrestricted movement<br />\nis already drastically curtailed by<br />\nthe existing conditions of urban<br />\nlife and the threat to my personal security that is constant<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nReaders Express Canine Sentiments<br />\ncont.from p. 4<br />\nand real. I could not walk<br />\naround the Hopkins campus at<br />\nthe times that I wish to if I were<br />\nnot accompanied by my dog,<br />\nmuch less walk home at night.<br />\nWhile the van system provides<br />\nmuch-needed<br />\nand<br />\nvaluable<br />\ntransportation for those who<br />\nwish to use it, this service is<br />\nlimited to the immediate vicinity<br />\nof Homewood and does not<br />\nreach many areas where women<br />\nwant and can afford to live. As<br />\na teaching assistant for the<br />\nuniversity, my salary does not<br />\npermit me to rent comparable<br />\nhousing any closer to campus.<br />\nAlthough I find the empty<br />\nbeer can and broken bottles at<br />\nleast as much of an unsightly<br />\nhazard as whatever \"mess\" dogs<br />\non campus may have caused,<br />\nthere are ways of cleaning up the<br />\ngrounds other than the restrictions on dogs that you have<br />\nordered. New York City has<br /><br />\ninstituted a penalty for not<br />\ncleaning up after one's dog that<br />\n\u2022has been working quite well for<br />\nseveral months. Perhaps Hopkins would like to try something<br />\nsimilar. Enforcement of a rule<br />\nthat all dogs must be accompanied or leashed at all times would<br />\neliminate roaming dogs and the<br />\ntrouble they might cause. And<br />\nsurely arrangements could be<br />\nworked out with the maintenance staff concerning dogs kept<br />\nin offices or labs whose owners<br />\nwould like them around for<br />\ncompany and protection, especially at night. Finally, I would<br />\nsuggest some sort of voluntary<br />\nlicensing procedure which would<br />\nallow complaints of behaviors<br />\nthat annoy others, such as noise<br />\nor intimidation, to be registered<br />\nagainst their owners, who<br />\nwould\u2014and should--bear the responsibility for their pets'<br />\nactions.<br /><br />\nThe administration's decisions wrongly assume that all of<br />\nus who own dogs are unwilling<br />\nto assume proper responsibility<br />\nfor them.

In fact,<br />\nAP was one of the forces behind<br />\nthe planning and publishing of<br />\n444 Days--Associated Press, one<br />\nof the two great news organs of<br />\nthis country. The hostages were<br />\nreleased on day 444, the book<br />\non day 452. The book was so<br />\nstructured that no matter what<br />\nday the hostages were released,<br />\nthe book would have appeared<br />\nexactly eight days after their<br />\nliberation.

A quote from the Day<br />\n1 entry: \"It was an ordinary<br />\nday in Teheran...\" 444 Days is<br />\nnot, unfortunately, an isolated<br />\nabhorrence--it is the herald of a<br />\nhorde of printed matter on the<br />\nhostage crisis yet to come.<br />\nI realize that there are laws<br />\ninsuring freedom of speech for<br />\nthe American media, but it<br />\nis unfortunate that it is impossible to construct laws insuring<br />\nthat the media use some tact.<br />\nCan you imagine what it must<br />\nfeel like to be an ex-hostage?<br />\nHunted by the press, people<br />\npointing you out in public<br />\nbecause of some stupid goddam<br />\nbook sold throughout the whole<br />\ncountry...

Again,<br />\nthese articles are harmless in and<br />\nof themselves, but they reflect a<br />\ngut-reaction nationalism which<br />\nhas pervaded our country for the<br />\npast year and a half.

The<br />\nFRCR proposals, as amended by the CUS, are<br />\nbeing forwarded to the Academic Council for<br />\nfinal approval.<br />\nSo why would.; you, a Hopkins undergrad<br />\nwith God knows enough to worry about as it is,<br />\ncare about what the CUS and Academic Council<br />\nare doing with some inane report?<br />\nIt's simple--it's gonna get you, right where<br />\nyou live, and don't you think different. Would<br />\nyou like to have only three weeks to add and<br />\ndrop courses? Would you like all two hour per<br />\nweek courses to receive only two credits?<br />\nWould you like to find out a little more about<br />\nthe FCRC report?<br />\nBack in November of 1978, the Academic<br />\nCouncil asked Dean Owen to put together a<br />\ncommittee to study undergraduate and graduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins. This committee, known<br />\nas the FCRC, was composed at any one time of<br />\ntwo<br />\nfive professors, one graduate student,<br />\nundergraduates, and two members of the Dean's Office.<br />\nThe FCRC met throughout 1979 and<br />\ndelivered its final report and recommendations--all sixteen pages of them including the appendix\u2014to Dean Owen in December, 1979. Owen<br />\nthen referred the report to the CUS, an advisory<br />\nsubcommittee of the Academic Council consisting of both faculty and undergraduates, which<br />\nis presently deliberating it.<br />\nAlthough the FCRC report was to deal<br />\nwith both undergraduate and graduate programs,<br />\nthe committee found \"no pressing matters<br />\nconcerning academic aspects of Graduate<br />\nprograms\" which warranted attention; consequently, all the report's recommendations concern undergraduate education.<br />\nTHE ADD/DROP DATE<br />\nLet's get back to the add/drop date and<br />\nthe deal about course hours/credits. The eightweek add/drop date creates problems in lab<br />\ncourses. \"We have such a liberal add/drop date<br />\nthat some students will sign up for a course and<br />\nwill take it for six weeks or eight weeks, then<br />\nthey'll drop it and sign up for it the following<br />\nsemester for the sole purpose of improving their<br />\ngrade\u2014it's like a dry run,\" explained Dean<br />\nMichael Hooker in an interview with the NewsLetter this week. \"This happens more in labs<br />\nthan anyplace else because it's in labs that this<br />\nkind of dry run experience will enhance your<br />\nchances of getting a good grade the second time<br />\naround.\"<br />\nTo prevent such abuses, the FCRC recommended adoption of a three-week add/drop<br />\ndate. The CUS took up the matter at its January 27 meeting this year. At its next meeting,<br />\nto be held March 3,Chuck Peifer,one of the four<br />\nvoting undergraduates on the CUS, will introduce a motion designed to amend the proposed three week limit. \"To keep that flexibility for students to be able to drop up to eight<br />\nweeks into the semester, but in order to cut<br />\ndown on the number of drop slips coming<br />\naround, the changes in programs, and the<br />\nproblems that creates for the Registrar's Office,<br />\nI'm proposing that every add/drop slip be signed<br />\nby the student's advisor,\" said Peifer in an<br />\ninterview this Tuesday. \"It's possible now for a<br />\nstudent to go to his advisor and sign up for<br />\nfive courses and then by the use of add/drops<br />\nchange that list completely from what it was<br />\noriginally intended to be. The fact that people<br />\nwill have to go see their advisors to get anything<br />\nchanged will result in less arbitrary course<br />\nselection. I see this as a compromise. I don't<br />\nthink it's the ideal situation;!\u2022 would prefer to<br />\nkeep the add/drop dates as they are.\"<br />\nPeifer also commented on other views<br />\nexpressed during the January 27 meeting.<br />\n\"Some professors do not like students dropping<br />\ncourses after they've begun because if you have<br />\na small seminar and you structure your course so<br />\nas to allow participation from each member, and<br />\none person drops out, commonly you'll have<br />\ngaps in the course. They would like to see the<br />\ninstructor's permission required to drop a course<br />\nafter three weeks as well as an advisor's. Now<br />\nthat I'm not too sure about. I mean that is<br /><br />\nChuck Peifer, one of CUS voting undergraduates,<br />\nputting so many restrictions on a student's<br />\nschedule that it sort of cements them in.\"<br />\nAnother possibility, which will be formally proposed at the next CUS meeting by<br />\nProfessor Patrick Moran (Mechanics), is to keep<br />\nthe present add date, make the drop date six<br />\nweeks after classes begin (instead of the present<br />\neight), and require advisors' signatures on all<br />\nadd/drop slips after the third week of classes.<br />\nPeifer's proposal leaves the drop date<br />\nintact and might serve to increase the rapport<br />\nbetween you and your advisor--but it's definitely<br />\ngoing to be a little less convenient and let's face<br />\nit\u2014some people don't even like going to see their<br />\nadvisors. I don't know how you feel about<br />\nneeding the prors permission to get out of a<br />\ncourse but I'm less than ecstatic. Moran's<br />\nsuggestion is a compromise between proposals<br />\nthat doesn't address the purported problems. If<br />\nit's true, as is claimed, that the Registrar's Office<br />\nis fouling up transcripts because of a deluge of<br />\nadd/drop slips at the beginning of a term,<br />\nallowing add/drops to proceed as usual during<br />\nthose first crucial weeks will hardly help.<br />\nIt seems reasonable that if late drops in<br />\nlab courses are the problem, then the date<br />\nshould be adjusted solely for those courses.<br />\nOther approaches geared towards making things<br />\neasier for the Registrar's Office at the expense<br />\nundergraduates seem a confu sion of<br />\nof<br />\npriorities.<br />\nCOURSE HOURS/CREDITS<br />\nIt's common knowledge that N, E, and Q<br />\ncourses generally stay much clgser to the one<br />\nhour one credit rule which is supposedly applied<br />\ncampus-wide than do H and S courses. Using<br />\nthe University's criteria referred to on page 3 of<br />\nthe FCRC report (each three credit course<br />\nshould require a minimum of 9 hours/week of<br />\nwork\u2014three in and six outside of class), it seems<br />\nclear that a good many N and E lab courses are<br />\nin fact undercredited.<br />\nThe FCRC recommends that \"each<br />\ndepartment should evaluate all 1 to 399 courses<br />\nto determine if a discrepancy exists between<br />\n:<br />\ncourse contact hours and allotted credit hours.<br />\nIn cases of discrepancies...three avenues are<br />\navailable for resolution of apparent conflicts:<br />\n(a) justification for a discrepancy between<br />\ncontact hours and credit hours should be explicitly stated both in the Catalog and in the<br />\nSchedule of Courses,(b) decrease in the number<br />\nof credits now allotted (see Appendix I for some<br />\npossible examples), and (c) increase in actual<br />\ncontact hours without increased outside workload in order to meet the criterion specified<br />\nabove.\" The \"Appendix I\" referred to is certainly enlightening as regards what might happen<br />\nif this recommendation becomes policy. Almost<br />\nevery course listed takes a credit cut; some<br />\ncourses are rendered absolutely inexpedient.<br /><br />\nPhilip Curtin's \"World and the West\" course<br />\n(80.330) would be reduced to 2 credits, for<br />\nexample; \"Integrated Circuits and Microprocessor Lab\" (54.49) would go the same route.<br />\nTo be sure, the FCRC noted that Appendix I<br />\nconsists only of possible course discrepancies;<br />\nboth these courses would probably remain at<br />\nthree credits under the first avenue for resolving<br />\nThe question now<br />\napparent discrepancies.<br />\nbecomes one of whether the faculty would decrease credits (without decreasing workload?) or<br />\nincrease contact hours without increasing<br />\noutside workload. I, for one, am not all that<br />\nanxious to see what would happen. My fear is<br />\nthat many, many courses especially in the H and<br />\nS areas, would be offered for less credit if this<br />\nrecommendation is adopted. How would you<br />\nlike to be taking 7 or 8 two credit courses next<br />\nsemester?<br />\nFortunately, the course hours/credits<br />\nequivalence recommended by the FCRC probably won't be approved by the CUS. \"I don't<br />\nthink that the one hour/one credit will pass<br />\nCUS, but I think that the CUS will probably go<br />\non record as recommending that the Dean<br />\ntighten up on credit allocation.\" said Dean<br />\nHooker. \"I don't think that they will recommend that we go to one hour/one credit because<br />\nit's unacceptable.\"<br />\nSo why dredge up the issue at all? Because it yields a little lesson about University<br />\npolitics. While it's true that the hours/credits<br />\nequivalence controversy will probably be resolved in favor of the undergrads, this will be as<br />\nmuch accident as design. Faculty concern<br />\nabout Homewood House encroachment in a<br />\ntraditionally departmental prerogative (setting<br />\ncourse credits) figures at least as largely as<br />\nconcern for the welfare of undergrads in the<br />\nwidespread condemnation of this proposal.<br /><br />\nthe FCRC reported that \"the Intersession<br />\nsupplies a number of useful activities which<br />\ndefinitely should be made available to Undergraduates annually during the appropriate<br />\nJanuary interval. Important activities currently<br />\ninclude School of Hygiene courses that are<br />\nrequired of some students, Engineering practice,<br />\nand independent research. On the other hand,<br />\nthe Faculty Curriculum Review Committee finds<br />\nthat the Intersession never has fulfilled expectations as a period of high innovation and<br />\nintellectual stimulation for the majority of<br />\nHopkins Undergraduates. Rather than a highpoint in the Undergraduate curriculum, the<br />\nIntersession has attracted minimal effort except<br />\nperhaps by graduate students in the Psychology<br />\nTotal offerings, content, and<br />\nDepartment.<br />\nenrollment have dwindled over the past few<br />\nyears. Members of the Faculty Curriculum<br />\nReview Committee agree unanimously that steps<br />\nshould be taken which will not only allow<br />\nretention of the Intersession but also strengthen<br />\nit into a training period of significance and<br />\nworthy of this University.\"<br />\nIs Intersession viable? A glance at enrollover the last five years suggests<br />\nstatistics<br />\nment<br />\nthat undergraduate interest in Intersession<br />\ncourses is high.

Transcripts<br />\nwill note that independent research and internships are so graded. Faculty sponsors of research and internships will be required to write<br />\nletters of appraisal for the student's record, to<br />\nbe used in applications to med schools, law<br />\nschools, graduate schools, etc. Independent<br />\nStudy will continue to be graded as it presently<br />\nis.<br />\nThe Academic Council did not altogether<br />\napprove of the CUS's motion. \"The Academic<br />\nCouncil passed it with a recommendation back<br />\nto the CUS that the F not compute into the<br />\nGPA,\" explained Dean Hooker. \"...The Academic Council apparently thought that it was<br />\nunfair for the F to compute into the GPA but<br />\nfor the P not to do so.\"<br />\nAt its meeting of January 27, the CUS<br />\nvoted to recommend to the Academic Council<br />\nthat it reconsider its decision. \"As it presently is<br />\nin pass/fail courses, the pass doesn't help the<br />\nGPA, but the F adversely affects it...so it [the<br />\nproposed research/internship grading] would be<br />\nan inconsistency,\" commented Dean Hooker.<br />\n\"The CUS was not sure that the Academic<br />\nCouncil actually 'considered that inconsistency.<br />\nAt least the CUS wants to bring it to their<br />\nattention to give them the opportunity to decide<br />\nwhether they want to go on record as being in<br />\nfavor of this inconsistency.

The Associate<br />\nDean for Undergraduate and Graduate Studies,<br />\nwho would make the appointments to the<br />\ncommittee, and the Director of Advising and<br />\nCounseling would be included as ex officio<br />\nmembers.<br />\nWhat should be realized about this proposed committee is that even though it is given a<br />\nlong list of functions on page 7 of the FCRC<br />\nreport (appraise on-going Intersession activities,<br />\nseek improvements in programming, etc.), in<br />\nfact the committee will do nothing, not from<br />\nlack of trying but because given the University<br />\npower structure there's almost nothing that it<br />\ncan do. This doesn't necessarily mean that the<br />\nproposal shouldn't be supported by the undergraduate community when it is taken up by the<br />\nCUS. It probably should be supported as an<br />\nembodified commitment of the University to a<br />\nstronger Intersession.<br />\nCONCLUSION<br />\nFour of the FCRC's most important<br />\nrecommendations have been discussed above;<br />\nthis by no means exhausts the significance of the<br />\nreport for undergraduates (for example, the<br />\nFCRC urges the adoption of plus/minus<br />\ngrading). This article cannot detail every proposal the FCRC made, nor should it have to.<br />\nThe Student's Council, with the close cooperation of the undergraduate representatives on<br />\nthe CUS, should be working every week to<br />\ninsure that the student body is well-informed as<br />\nto the FCRC report's progress in the CUS' As a<br />\nstart, free copies of the FCRC report should be<br />\nmade easily available to students.<br />\nChuck Peiffer, Stuart Stahl, John Ragheb,<br />\nMichael Steele, and David Freidman(an alternate)<br />\nare our undergraduate representatives on the<br />\nCUS' Together they wield four votes out of a<br />\ntotal of ten in the CUS; they can and do influence the committee's decisions.<br />\nThe Academic Council, the body which<br />\nactually sets University policy, is beyond the<br />\nHowever, the<br />\nrange of student influence.<br />\nAcademic Council will consider and implement<br />\nthe FCRC's recommendations only as reviewed<br />\nand amended by the CUS.

Thus, Intersession as a whole is the sum<br />\ntotal of decisions made individually by each<br />\nfaculty member as to whether her or she will<br />\nteach a course. It has never been University<br />\npolicy that each department has to offer Inter\u2014<br />\nsession courses; given the power structure of the<br />\nUniversity, such a directive would be impossible.<br />\nPower at Hopkins resides at the level of the<br />\nindividual professor; the deans, and to a lesser<br />\nextent even the department chairmen, cannot<br />\nforce the professors to do anything.<br />\nNonetheless, there was some success this<br />\nyear in beefing up Intersession: the number of<br />\ncourses offered increased from 37 in 1980 to 50<br />\nin 1981, while enrollments rose accordingly<br />\nfrom 332 to 465.<br />\nVarious plans have been suggested to<br />\nstrengthen Intersession. One possibility is to<br />\npay professors to teach during Intersession. This<br />\nwould undoubtedly increase course offerings but<br />\nundergrads would probably be charged extra<br />\ntuition to take Intersession courses. The FCRC<br />\nrejected such a plan.<br />\nAnother idea, put forth by Dean Hooker,<br />\nis to expand Intersession by allowing graduate<br />\nstudents to teach courses. -What I would like to<br />\ndo is to expand the Intersession by giving<br />\nsenior-level graduate students in departments the<br />\nopportunity to develop courses that they<br />\nINTERSESSION<br />\nwould like to try out,\" Hooker said. \"They may<br />\nbeen working with some students in<br />\nhave<br />\nFCRC<br />\nConcerning the Intersession, the<br />\ncourse and it would be a good time for<br />\na<br />\nregular<br />\nof<br />\nside<br />\nplumped down pretty much on the<br />\nto<br />\ncontinue that kind of work or to Hooker puts forth ideas to expand Intersession.<br />\nthem<br />\n6,<br />\npage<br />\nundergraduates.

What the viewing public<br />\nwitnesses now is no more than the usual<br />\nselection of boxing films--the smattering<br />\nof \"contendor\" pieces which have proven<br />\nsuch an American staple. Prizefighting is<br />\nvery much American, if only through<br />\nadoption, and film audiences have always<br />\nbeen willing to watch a down-and-outpalooka parlay childhood streetfighting<br />\ninto the bone-crushing fame and glory<br />\nof a championship bout.<br />\nAll this taken into account, one<br />\ncannot expect Raging Bull to usher in any<br />\nsort of film trend, since it follows in an<br />\nAmerican cinematic tradition. Just as<br />\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid<br />\nestablished the team of Redford and<br />\nNewman, but not a renaissance of westerns, Raging Bull will probably only<br />\nstrengthen star Robert DeNiro's career<br />\nand have little effect upon the station of<br />\nthe boxing film in American movie<br />\nhistory.<br />\nNevertheless, Raging Bull is a<br />\npowerful and innovative film. Boxer Jake<br />\nLaMotta is the focus, but the script treats<br />\nhis ring time as an aside, preferring to<br />\ndevelop the character as man rather than<br />\nas a sports legend. The bulk of the film<br />\ncatches snippets of LaMotta's deteriorating relationship with his brother/mana-<br /><br />\nger and the woman he marries after<br />\nditching his first wife. Essentially, Raging<br />\nBull is a character study. One can hardly<br />\nwonder at its success, with the reunion of<br />\nDeNiro and director Martin Scorsese<br />\nwhose collaboration in Taxi Driver<br />\nlaunched DeNiro's career.<br />\nportrays two Jake<br />\nDeNiro<br />\nLaMottas: the vicious palooka of the<br />\nboxing ring and a fat older man stumbling<br />\nthrough life in an attempt to mop up the<br />\nmistakes and recapture the glory of his<br />\nboxing days. The film opens in a dressing<br />\nroom, where the retired LaMotta rehearses a clumsy poem. Next, the camera<br />\nretreats in time, seeking out a boxing ring<br />\nwhere a young and wiry LaMotta polishes<br />\noff the first in a long line of champions.<br />\nThen, on to the grimy Bronx neighborhood and the turbulent domestic life of a<br />\nman perpetually driven to violence.<br />\nIt is not until the last half-hour that the<br />\naudience returns to that dressing room.<br />\nBy then, the film has traced the fighter's<br />\ncareer and the stormy consequences of<br />\nhis obsessive jealousy toward his wife.<br />\nLaMotta has turned away his brother, his<br />\nvoice of reason, he wades friendless<br />\nthrough the atrophying limbo of athletic<br />\nretirement. LaMotta is now a nightclub<br />\nentertainer, somewhat more tame than<br />\nhis younger self, but no less tragic.<br />\nDeNiro's performance is understated, yet inspiring, though the creative<br />\nchemistry between him and director<br />\nScorsese contributes to much of this<br />\nsuccess. There is an impressive depth<br />\nto the portrayal of Jake LaMotta, a rapid<br />\nidentification with the audience and a<br />\nclear pattern of behav'.or which, fortun-<br /><br />\nately, does not lapse into the predictable.<br />\nDirector and actor play the weary entertainer against the boxer beautifully. This,<br />\nperhaps, is pivotal to this character<br />\nstudy, as the transition from sports to<br />\nretirement is the most telling of an<br />\nathlete.<br />\nRaging Bull is technically ingenious. Director Scorsese chose a blackand-white format to instill realism and<br />\ntone down the gory dynamics of the<br />\nbloodletting fight sequences. He uses<br />\nseveral elements of the \"documentary<br />\nstyle.\" The camera roves through the<br />\naction with frenzied immediacy, switching to slow motion when the audience<br />\nmust concentrate on certain scenes. This<br />\nparticular tack works well. The contemporary viewer is so used to the visual<br />\nexcitement of color films that more than<br />\nan hour of black and white will lull him<br /><br />\nLive Werewolf<br /><br />\nir 51<br /><br />\nWarren Howls Again<br />\nBY DAN VITALE<br />\nWarren Zevon's Stand in the<br />\nFire ambles into this season's ghost-town<br />\nof live-album releases like a desperado<br />\ngorilla at high noon. Recorded at L.A.'s<br />\nRoxy Theater in the spring of 1980,<br />\nStand in the Fire hit the stores at the tail<br />\nend of a Christmas season concert record<br />\nglut that included alarmingly feeble<br />\nefforts by such heavyweights as Heart,<br />\nthe Eagles, Fleetwood Mac and Supertramp. Zevon, hardly a \"big name,\" has<br />\noutdone them all, producing two sides of<br />\nrelentless rock and roll with the assistance<br />\nof a tighter, harsher line-up of background musicians than has appeared on<br />\nany of his previous studio albums.<br />\nZevon, who is probably bestknown for his 1978 album Excitable Boy,<br /><br />\nKandinskyWatercolors On Display<br />\nBY MARK SKONER<br />\nWassily Kandinsky is often described as the first abstract painter. More<br />\nthan any other painter, with the possible<br />\nexception of Piet Mondrian, he is identified with the transition from representational to abstract art. Fifty Kandinsky<br />\nwatercolors are on display at the Baltimore Museum through March 1. The<br />\nselection represents only a fraction of<br />\nKandinsky's work in watercolor, but it<br />\nincludes paintings from every phase of his<br />\ncareer, and affords a modest overview of<br />\nthe artist's development.<br />\nKandinsky was interested in theosophy and the relation between material<br />\nsubstance and ethereal essence. This<br />\ninterest was the impetus behind many of<br />\nhis early abstractions. What we witness in<br />\nthese paintings is the disintegration of the<br />\nnexus between form and color so that<br />\ncolor floats free of form, while the<br />\ndiscarded form is left with a substanceless<br />\nlife of its own. Color and line interpenetrate and separate as they move across the<br />\ncanvas in a state of flux, looking as if in<br />\nsome former existence they had been<br />\ncombined to present a solid object.<br />\nAlthough lines do establish forms, many<br />\nwander freely around the erupting<br /><br />\nlandscape as objects of interest in themselves--black, thick, and vibrant.<br />\nSometimes Kandinsky uses color<br />\nso that it emanates from line alone, as if<br />\nsubstance and form had disintegrated and<br />\nbeen subsumed, as color, into the quality<br />\nof the lines. Black lines emerge from<br />\nstreaks of dark color, suggesting that the<br />\nblack has dissolved into its own manifold<br />\ncolor components-the color appears to<br />\nburn through from the very center of the<br />\nblack.<br /><br />\nor her into detachment. The use of slow<br />\nmotion grabs the audience and, through<br />\nconvention, creates the illusion that they<br />\nview the action through another's point<br />\nof view--namely, that of Jake LaMotta.<br />\nUnfortunately, Raging Bull is<br />\ntedious. Many scenes run too long and<br />\ncertain points are overstated. Despite the<br />\nperformances and Scorsese's variety in<br />\ntechnique, it is easy to tire of the film,<br />\nespecially in the last fifteen minutes.<br />\nHowever, the film will enthrall boxing<br />\nfans, as well as devotees of the characterstudy genre. Raging Bull does not make<br />\nfor an evening of light entertainment. Its<br />\nhumor is grotesque; its tone, somewhat<br />\noppressive and heavy. Though it deserves<br />\nthe nomination,Raging Bull is exhausting<br />\ncinema, requiring a certain frame of<br />\nmind from the viewer. See it, yes, but<br />\nexpect to become involved.<br /><br />\nWhile Kandinsky's early watercolors are amorphous and chaotic, works<br />\nfrom the 1920s (when he was a member<br />\nof the Bauhaus) are very geometrical,<br />\nmore severe and lucid, and often more<br />\ngraphic than pictorial. Nevertheless, they<br />\nretain a spontaneous quality and iconographic complexity which set them apart<br />\nfrom other artists' geometric abstractions<br />\nof the same period. These paintings use<br />\ncolor sparingly. They are filled with<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nhas freed himself from the slightly<br />\nmellow musicianship which characterized<br />\nthat album and the one prior to it,<br />\nBoth were<br />\n1976's Warren Zevon.<br />\nproduced in whole or in part by Zevon's<br />\nmentor, Jackson Browne. This change,<br />\nhinted at in the self-produced Bad Luck<br />\nStreak in Dancing School of early 1980,<br />\nemerges fully in concert, and is captured<br />\nperfectly on Stand in the Fire. If anything, the new style only serves to amplify the strength of Zevon's lyrics, which<br />\nhave never been exactly mild, to say the<br />\nleast. The gritty cynicism and deadly<br />\nplayfulness of his songs, powerful enough<br />\nin the studio, bursts forth with a vengeance onstage.<br />\nThe album opens with \"Stand in<br />\nthe Fire,\" a statement of Zevon's theory<br />\nof performing-that of musician as<br />\ntightrope walker. The ominous yet<br />\nmischevous tone of the song acknowledges the challenge of doing battle<br />\nwith one's rock and roll demons night<br />\nafter night without denying the sheer<br />\nexhilaration that results from it. This<br />\nphilosophy resonates like thunder<br />\nthroughout the ,album.<br />\nIn \"Jeannie Needs a Shooter,\"<br />\nco-written with Bruce Springsteen, the<br />\nout-in-the-street-and-down-by-familiar<br />\nthe-river-with-my-girl concerns so prevalent in Springsteen's work are given a<br />\nsharper edge with the addition of Zevon's<br />\nfatalistic ideas about romance and his<br />\nIn<br />\npenchant for nasty plot twists.<br />\n\"Excitable Boy,\" the aberrant actions of<br />\na mildly disturbed youth are set of nicely<br />\nwith fifties-style \"ooh-wah-ooh\" harmonies, leaping piano countermelodies,<br />\nand the constant straightfaced disclaimer:<br />\n\"He's just an excitable boy.\" In \"Werewolves of London,\" Zevon uses the<br />\nopportunity offered by the in-concert<br />\natmosphere to add extra bite to the<br />\nby-now trademark werewolf howls,<br />\nand to take potshots at popular culture<br />\nby injecting reterences to Jackson<br />\nBrowne, used cars, James Taylor, Perrier,<br />\nwherever<br />\nDePalma<br />\nBrian<br />\nand<br />\nappropriate;while the maniacal phrasings<br />\nemployed in \"Lawyers, Guns, and<br />\nMoney\" render the plight of a not-soinnocent abroad even more desperately than on the studio version.<br />\nZevon does have a softer side,<br />\nhowever, although it is not as apparent on<br />\ncont. on p. 14<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY 6,1981 / PAGE 14<br /><br />\nBoscoe the Cineaste's February Pix<br />\nConservatives have seen it as a monument<br />\nto a great figure of American history; the<br />\nleftists have seen it as the portrayal of a<br />\ntrue lunatic.

These works seerrto exude tension: tension between exact<br />\nand inexact, complete and fragmented<br />\nforms; between main forms and constellations of miscellaneous elements. It is<br />\nimpossible to tell whether a picture is on<br />\nthe verge of integration or in the process<br />\nof explosion.<br />\nKandinsky rejected the notion<br />\nthat abstract painting must confine itself<br />\nto a single picture plane. His paintings<br />\nestablish a uniquely ambiguous space-sometimes shallow, sometimes naturalistic. Forms spread out over a homogenous plane, and we are not impelled to see<br />\nan illusory space around objects, yet we<br />\ndo not see one single surface either.<br />\nKandinsky uses visual clues, such as<br />\nshading and convergent lines, in contradictory ways. Colors play against each<br />\nother and against linear forms so that<br />\nelements of the picture appear to be<br />\nfloating freely in some \"new\" space.<br />\nKandinsky's paintings are particularly susceptible to interpretation as<br />\nrealistic scenes: \"The triangle looks like a<br />\nman, the circle is a sun,\" and so forth.<br />\nIndeed, there are many forms which<br />\ndemand to be read in realistic terms, and<br />\nwhich Kandinsky must have included<br />\ndeliberately. For example, On Violet<br />\nlooks like ,a surrealistic cartoon: a boat<br />\nchugs uphill past a huge hair, towards a<br /><br />\nbridge. But even when there are no<br />\nexplicit resemblances, the geometrical<br />\npaintings seem to imply a reality through<br />\nsheer expressive energy. This is because<br />\nmost of the forms derive from objects in<br />\nthe world. Kandinsky's abstractional<br />\nmethod puts images from his own visual<br />\nexperience through a sieve. For him the<br />\nimportant thing was that the object lose<br />\nits identity as a concrete fixture of the<br />\nworld with a certain material function;<br />\nthen a viewer might concentrate on the<br />\nway it looks rather than on what it is.<br />\nKandinsky employed circles, triangles,<br />\nand squares, and separated line and color<br />\nnot in order to present these things as<br />\n\"pure\" entities in their own right, but to<br />\nconcentrate with great specificity one<br />\naspect of an image while reducing and<br />\nfiltering out others.<br />\nKandinsky's late- and postBauhaus watercolors reveal increasingly<br />\nsophisticated technique.<br />\nWatercolor<br />\nmists applied with an atomizer, spatters,<br />\nand multiple washes contribute to simpler<br />\ncompositions which rely more on color.<br />\nThroughout the 1930s Kandinsky's work<br />\nbecomes much more controlled and<br />\nsimplified\u2014the explosive detail so characteristic of his Bauhaus watercolors<br />\ndisappears. Finally, in the 1940s, his<br />\npaintings acquire a biomorphic quality, as<br />\nwell as renewed complexity.<br />\nKandinsky's paintings renounce<br />\nties with the visible, but not ties with<br />\nreality. Individual components are pure<br />\ninvention, yet the whole painting constitutes a poetry of forms linked analogically and metaphorically to reality. We see a<br />\npainting full of strange shapes, planes of<br />\ncolor, lines, grids, figure, and ground--a<br />\nvisual field resolved into a visual world<br />\nonly by an act of imagination.<br />\nKandinsky has given us a world in which<br />\nspatial relationship are different from our<br />\nown, which contains objects that do not<br />\noccur in our experience, but which<br />\nconvince us as representatives of the<br />\nhidden and mysterious reality behind the<br />\nworld of appearance.<br /><br />\ntc===x)==vc==xx==xic==a==\u2022ex==m1<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n' S-:,ETTER PAGE 154<br /><br />\nLIVE<br />\nLUTE<br />\nby<br />\nRonn<br />\nMcFarlane<br />\nWed. &amp; Sat. evenings<br /><br />\nYfritt;ng gel/4 ec/ingnittee<br /><br />\nfir<br />\nber's U<br />\nplace<br />\nRestaurant<br />\n34th &amp; St. Paul<br />\n10% Discount with<br />\nSTUDENT I.D.<br />\n2:30 - 5:00, Mon. - Fri.<br /><br />\now4e- acceittity<br /><br />\nU<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ne-traeit er/ni<br />\nMe/me<br /><br />\nJig<br /><br />\ne*'&amp;41,6rai.<br /><br />\n9/n/st (he *tiny tdif114 agl:Ce 612<br />\ne9cI m eley44<br />\ncreAfteitt;ny ey gektact<br /><br />\nHEWLETT<br />\nPACKARD<br /><br />\nJACK<br />\nTYSON<br />\n.congrats<br />\non your<br />\nbetrothal<br />\nfrom BillDean<br />\nand the<br />\nWild Bachelors<br /><br />\n18th.<br /><br />\nrepresentatives will be on campus<br /><br />\nIFcamonmaog RR aIn<br />\nWe will be talking to students in the following fields<br />\nancnnimilanmwrImg<br /><br />\nc:MEmc.aH(ml]EmemssAmg<br /><br />\n-MaraTm_ MmenDmmailimo<br />\n-Nmanaam'fiTo<br /><br />\n-HmAmonnaYtnco<br /><br />\n-HalftImnyinEadimll CasIIITS<br /><br />\n-HaxamffilmL acrImmm {Emulansmffilmc<br /><br />\n-lagono<br /><br />\n(bachelors &amp; masters )<br /><br />\nin the Placement Bureau, Merryman Hall<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY 6, 1981 / PAGE 16<br /><br />\nBay And Dick Lead Squad<br /><br />\nHopkins Women Swim Towards MACFinale<br />\nBY DAVE EINOLF<br />\nTallying a 7-5 record over<br />\nthe intersession and early second<br />\nsemester season, the Johns Hopkins women's swimming team<br />\ncontinues to do better than was<br />\nexpected before the season.

The women may qualify<br />\nseveral more, including the constantly improving junior diver<br />\nLee Anne Faulkner.<br />\nThis year the Jays are<br />\nblessed with a strong performance by a freshman, Heather<br />\nDick. Dick has led the Jays in<br />\nthe freestyle competition, and<br />\nwith Bay has managed to wrap<br />\nup the top national times in the<br />\n200, 500, and 1000 meter<br />\nfreestyle. The combination of<br />\nDick, Smith, Bay, and Aronowitz has also captured a Division<br />\nIII spot for their performance in<br />\nthe 800 free relay, turining in a<br />\ntime of 8:25.55.<br />\nIn other events, both Bay<br />\nand Aronowitz have qualified in<br />\nboth the 400 individual- medley,<br />\nwith times of 4:49.64 and<br />\n4:58.83, respectively; and in the<br />\n200 meter butterfly, with times<br />\nof 2:16.21 and 2:18.97.<br />\nThe Hopkins women swim<br />\nagainst American U., Maryland,<br />\nand George Washington before<br />\nthey travel to Widener during<br />\nthe closing weekend of February<br />\nto compete in the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference (MAC)<br />\nchampionships.
