With the entire University anticipating a<br />\nmonumental investigation of the problems of<br />\nundergraduate education at Hopkins the panel delivered a<br />\n52-page, statistic-ridden document which, although<br />\npresenting several signifigant recommendations, falls short<br />\nof its goal. The original charge of the BRP was to study the<br />\nproblems of undergraduates on a scale encompassing areas<br />\nbeyond the strictly academic.<br />\nThe failure of the panel to complete its task and<br />\nproduce a creative report on undergraduate education is<br />\nnot simply the fault of the panel. Certainly the problems<br />\nof internal dissent and lack of stable leadership hampered<br />\nthe functioning of the panel. Student response was<br />\nnegligible thus limiting the findings of the panel to dry<br />\nstatistic analysis and the personal views of panel members.<br />\nThe BRP did have the wisdom to recognize the findings of<br />\nthe Student Council hearings and adopted several of the<br />\nproposals of the reports from the hearings.<br />\nUltimately the panel's interim report is a timid attempt<br />\nto suggest the badly needed changes in education. Unsure<br />\nof their importance and power to affect change, the BRP<br />\nhas apparently kept a tight lid on any imaginative<br />\nsuggestions for improvement which they felt would have<br />\nno chance for implimentation.<br />\nHopefully the panel's final report due before Christmas<br />\nwill broaden its scope and abandon its feelings of<br />\ninsecurity.<br />\n<br />\nStudent senate<br />\nLarry Denton, newly-appointed Director of Student<br />\nServices, has promulgated his own version of a University<br />\nSenate, as opposed to merely a student senate, for the<br />\nDivision of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nHis support, if it is sincere, is certainly welcome. But<br />\nstudents would do well to maintain -a modicum of<br />\nskepticism: Denton is not known for his independence of<br />\nUniversity administrator George Benton; this move could<br />\nbe a maneuver to divert student energies from the real<br />\nproblems of the University into the traditional committee<br />\nmaze.<br />\nIf Denton's suggestion is accepted, the present Arts and<br />\nSciences Advisiory Council will get a new name, and<br />\nstudents (and, in the long run, the entire University) will<br />\nget nothing more than the governance report they rejected<br />\na year ago.<br />\nAlthough no real progress seems to have been made by<br />\nthe Committee for a Student Senate, its disbanding in<br />\nfavor of Denton's project would almost certainly represent<br />\nmore of the usual one-step-forward, two-steps back<br />\nadministrative shuffling.<br />\n<br />\nOctober 19, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\n,/<br />\n\"There Doesn't Seem To Be Anything Frozen Here<br />\n<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nWith amazement and shock I<br />\nread Gulin's article in last<br />\nFriday's News-Letter. I even<br />\nread it twice because I was there<br />\nand Dr. Muller's comments were<br />\nmost definitely not pessimistic.<br />\nThe feeling I got from the talk<br />\nwas one of optimism. An<br />\noptimism, I might add, that has<br />\nbeen missing from the Hopkins<br />\nadministration since my arrival<br />\nfour years ago. Muller's talk last<br />\nWednesday was refreshing, if<br />\nonly because he expressed a<br />\nsincere and enthusiastic interest<br />\nby coming to talk with the<br />\nstudents. He spoke, in my<br />\nestimation, only in positive<br />\nterms of constructing an<br />\ninnovative, new Hopkins.<br />\nGulin's article quotes Muller<br />\nseveral times; however, the<br />\nquotes are so flagrantly slanted<br />\nthey question Gulin's credibility.<br />\nIt would appear to me that<br />\nGulin could have grasped the<br />\ngeneral tone of the discussion a<br />\nlittle better. His rhetoric is<br />\nmatched only by his negativism.<br />\nDuring the approximately two<br />\nhours that Muller spoke, he<br />\nanswered questions asked by<br />\nthose present. The mood was<br />\none of building. Muller<br />\nexplained how Hopkins was in a<br />\ntransition period, a time when<br />\nthe feuding of last spring could<br />\nbe put aside and the future<br />\ncould be looked toward with<br />\nnew ideas.<br />\nMuller mentioned that<br />\nHopkins was about to reach a<br />\npoint where it would either be a<br />\ngreat University with innovative<br />\napproaches to education or it<br />\nwould just continue existing,<br />\nfollowing a pattern set in 1876.<br />\nI don't fault Gulin his article.<br />\nI think it stems from not having<br />\na proper perspective of<br />\nHopkins's past and potential<br />\n<br />\nfuture.

The country that gave American<br />\nexpatriates a home felt the magic of their spirited<br />\nprime minister taking a 22 year old wife. With<br />\nthe voting age lowered to 18, a flow of legislation<br />\nwas directed toward the new constituency.<br />\nThe spirit of the country became the spirit of<br />\nyouth.

But if you're<br />\ngoing to Canada and look a bit scruffy, the<br />\nimmigration people might not care that you're<br />\nyoung. We had an experience at the Canadian<br />\nborder recently that doesn't jive with the<br />\npulp-made image.<br />\nArriving by bus, we filled out the form they<br />\ngave us and waited in line before the immigration<br />\nofficial; a neat, young man sitting behind an old<br />\ndesk. When we reached the front of the line, the<br />\nofficial took our form and carefully read it. He<br />\nreached the bottom of the page and looked up at<br />\n'<br />\n.us. His eyes were evasive, but his expression was<br />\npleasant enough, if perhaps a little serious. \"Have<br />\nyou ever used drugs before?\" he asked, his voice<br />\nneutral.<br />\nDave Pickall is a Junior<br />\n<br />\nWe only hesitated for a moment, for we sensed<br />\nno danger. \"Yes, we've smoked some grass a few<br />\ntimes: some marijuana.\"<br />\nThe young official looked down at theform.<br />\nWhen he spoke again, his voice was haughty.<br />\n\"I'm sorry, but I'll have to refer your case to a<br />\nhigher official. This is out of my jurisdiction.\"<br />\n\"Progressive-thinking Canada,\" we mumbled.<br />\n\"This can't be happening.\" But the shit had<br />\nindeed hit the fan. When we finally emerged<br />\nfrom the immigration building two hours later,<br />\nwe carried a deportation notice. In the words of<br />\nthe law, we were persons \"of the prohibited class<br />\nof persons described in paragraph (d)of section 5<br />\nof the Immigration Act in that you are persons<br />\nwho admit having committed a crime involving<br />\nmoral turpitude, namely the unlawful possession<br />\nof a narcotic.\" We were surprised at being<br />\ndeported for admitting that we had smoked a<br />\nlittle weed at indefinite times in our past, and<br />\nnot knowing the nuances of 'turpitude,' we<br />\nthought that our crime must have been the moral<br />\nturpitude violation. We found a dictionary that<br />\nnight somewhere in Montana.<br />\nBack in the US of A, we phoned the Canadian<br />\nembassy for comment on Canada's policy toward<br />\nmarijuana smokers wishing to visit Canada. An<br />\ninformation source with the embassy told us that<br />\nif he smoked marijuana and was asked at the<br />\nborder if he had ever used drugs, that he<br />\n\"wouldn't really mention it.\" We agreed that<br />\nthat might be the best idea.<br />\n<br />\n\fhe<br />\nng<br />\n.se<br />\npn<br />\n!ss<br />\nve<br />\nre<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\nhe<br />\ner<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\nhe<br />\nh.<br />\nhe<br />\nd,<br />\n<br />\nss<br />\n<br />\nOctober 19, 1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nCleaning up: the Turtles meet their Mothers<br />\nBy MICHAEL HILL<br />\nFrank Zappa was born and<br />\nraised in Baltimore and he<br />\nreturned Sunday with a tribute<br />\nto vegetables and a play-by-play<br />\naccount of the World Series.<br />\nNot too many of the sell-out<br />\naudience that filled the Lyric<br />\ntheatre for the afternoon<br />\nconcert admitted interest in the<br />\noutcome of the Series' seventh<br />\ngame, but Zappa and crew kept<br />\nUS informed, and made it one of<br />\n<br />\nthe major themes of the concert.<br />\nThey were doing up vegetables,<br />\nbut Boog Powell was hanging in<br />\nthere with a 3 and 2 count.<br />\nZappa broke up the original<br />\nMothers a few years ago, and the<br />\nreformed group, though<br />\ncertainly one of the best, just<br />\ncannot match Jimmy Carl Black<br />\nand the rest.

This evened<br />\nHopkins' record for the season<br />\nat two wins and two losses.<br />\nThe top Hopkins' runner in<br />\nthis meet was Russ Dubiel who<br />\nfinished third behind two of<br />\nDrexel's runners (first against<br />\nHaverford). Jeff Greve was the<br />\nnext Hopkins' runner to place,<br />\nfinishing seventh officially,<br />\nthough this was good enough for<br />\nsecond place against Haverford.<br />\nNevertheless, Hopkins could<br />\nnot continue to do well against<br />\nHaverford, as three Haverford<br />\n<br />\nmen finished before (and two<br />\ndirectly after) Hopkins' next<br />\nplacer, freshman Dave Piccoli,<br />\nwho finished fourteenth. Other<br />\nmen placing for Hopkins were<br />\nChuck Mick (18th)and Ira Luke<br />\n(19th place).<br />\nThough the team had never<br />\nexpected to beat Drexel, they<br />\nwere a bit upset over losing to<br />\nHaverford. According to one<br />\nmember on the team, the results<br />\nmight have been much better<br />\nhad sophomore Austin Doyle<br />\nbeen able to run. Austin is the<br />\nteam's third best runner, but is<br />\ncurrently recovering from an<br />\nankle injury. Doyle is expected<br />\nto run once again, though, in<br />\nthis afternoon's meet against<br />\nGettysburg on their course.<br />\nvar<br />\n<br />\nPEABODY AT HOPKINS<br />\npresented by<br />\n<br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\nThursday, October 21, 12 noon<br />\nGarrett Room, Eisenhower Library, Homewood Campus<br />\n<br />\nROOSEVELT NEWSON, JR., pianist<br />\nPerforming a Program of<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nBeethoven and Schumann<br />\ndr<br />\n<br />\nIHAR,LEY'S<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1 11111<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nV./<br />\n<br />\n\u2022.1<br />\n.<br />\n':!.<br />\n..If<br />\nir 111111111<br />\n<br />\n...<br />\nI<br />\n01\\<br />\n<br />\nB&M<br />\n31st & Guilford<br />\nI<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nFamous<br />\n<br />\nADMISSION FREE<br />\n<br />\nPREGNANT?<br />\n<br />\n. ,.<br />\n<br />\n, Original Sub<br />\nguaranteed to Maul the Mundties<br />\nHARLEY'S 3111 St. Paul<br />\nOpen Late<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nFor Our.<br />\n<br />\nyou have decided to terminate<br />\nyour pregnancy we can help you.<br />\n(Abortions are legal in New York State<br />\nand residency is not required).<br />\nWe wort on a STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL<br />\nbasis and there is NO REFERRAL FEE<br />\nfor our services.<br />\nWe will refer you the best and least<br />\nexpensive facilities possible, absolutely<br />\nFREE OF CHARGE.<br />\nPrices from:<br />\n$150 UP TO 14 WEEKS PREGNANCY<br />\n<br />\nFor information Call:<br />\n<br />\nsomewhat more expensive for more<br />\nadvanced pregnancies according to facilities.<br />\n<br />\n(212)873.3492<br />\n<br />\nSubmarine<br />\n<br />\nor write to:<br />\n<br />\nWOMEN'S<br />\nORIENTATION CENTER<br />\n<br />\nSandwiches<br />\n9a.rn.-1 a.m.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins'Harry Stringer(20)carries on a sweep.<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n257 Central Park West<br />\nNew York.<br />\nA MON MONT OINANIZATKON<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n0,<br />\n5.,\u00b0 \u2022<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n. 0,......\u2022 #...% . .<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n0. .\u2022<br />\nr...\u202211\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n,,_(\u2022;0\u20229,,,,..<br />\n\u2022- -\u2022 .4,<br />\n.. s\u2022 ..\u2022 .. ?\u2022 \u2022<br />\n\u00b0 \u00b0'<br />\n<br />\nOctober 22 & 23<br />\n<br />\nJaimie Brockett,folk musician,<br />\nentertainer and song stylist<br />\nShows at 9:30, 11 p.m. & 12:30 a.m.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "BRP Viewed As Realistic But Too Limited<br />\nBy DON LASSUS<br />\nDespite the fact that the Blue<br />\nRibbon Panel's interim report<br />\nfell short of the extensive<br />\ninvestigation of undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins that was<br />\nexpected, the report has<br />\nsignifigance in being the first<br />\nin-depth study of education<br />\nhere, and value in its realistic<br />\nproposals for improvement.<br />\nThe panel was recommended<br />\nby the Howard Committee in<br />\nthe spring of<br />\n1970 to investigate the probNEWS<br />\nlems of<br />\nANALYSIS undergraduates<br />\nat Hopkins.<br />\nConsidering its<br />\noriginal charge, the report is<br />\nonly partially complete, dealing<br />\ntotally with the academic side of<br />\nundergraduate education and<br />\nignoring other aspects.<br />\nMembers of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity from Dean George<br />\nBenton to student members of<br /><br />\nSigmund R.

With the entire University anticipating a<br />\nmonumental investigation of the problems of<br />\nundergraduate education at Hopkins the panel delivered a<br />\n52-page, statistic-ridden document which, although<br />\npresenting several signifigant recommendations, falls short<br />\nof its goal. The original charge of the BRP was to study the<br />\nproblems of undergraduates on a scale encompassing areas<br />\nbeyond the strictly academic.<br />\nThe failure of the panel to complete its task and<br />\nproduce a creative report on undergraduate education is<br />\nnot simply the fault of the panel. Certainly the problems<br />\nof internal dissent and lack of stable leadership hampered<br />\nthe functioning of the panel. Student response was<br />\nnegligible thus limiting the findings of the panel to dry<br />\nstatistic analysis and the personal views of panel members.<br />\nThe BRP did have the wisdom to recognize the findings of<br />\nthe Student Council hearings and adopted several of the<br />\nproposals of the reports from the hearings.<br />\nUltimately the panel's interim report is a timid attempt<br />\nto suggest the badly needed changes in education. Unsure<br />\nof their importance and power to affect change, the BRP<br />\nhas apparently kept a tight lid on any imaginative<br />\nsuggestions for improvement which they felt would have<br />\nno chance for implimentation.<br />\nHopefully the panel's final report due before Christmas<br />\nwill broaden its scope and abandon its feelings of<br />\ninsecurity.<br /><br />\nStudent senate<br />\nLarry Denton, newly-appointed Director of Student<br />\nServices, has promulgated his own version of a University<br />\nSenate, as opposed to merely a student senate, for the<br />\nDivision of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nHis support, if it is sincere, is certainly welcome. But<br />\nstudents would do well to maintain -a modicum of<br />\nskepticism: Denton is not known for his independence of<br />\nUniversity administrator George Benton; this move could<br />\nbe a maneuver to divert student energies from the real<br />\nproblems of the University into the traditional committee<br />\nmaze.<br />\nIf Denton's suggestion is accepted, the present Arts and<br />\nSciences Advisiory Council will get a new name, and<br />\nstudents (and, in the long run, the entire University) will<br />\nget nothing more than the governance report they rejected<br />\na year ago.<br />\nAlthough no real progress seems to have been made by<br />\nthe Committee for a Student Senate, its disbanding in<br />\nfavor of Denton's project would almost certainly represent<br />\nmore of the usual one-step-forward, two-steps back<br />\nadministrative shuffling.<br /><br />\nOctober 19, 1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\n,/<br />\n\"There Doesn't Seem To Be Anything Frozen Here<br /><br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nWith amazement and shock I<br />\nread Gulin's article in last<br />\nFriday's News-Letter. I even<br />\nread it twice because I was there<br />\nand Dr. Muller's comments were<br />\nmost definitely not pessimistic.<br />\nThe feeling I got from the talk<br />\nwas one of optimism. An<br />\noptimism, I might add, that has<br />\nbeen missing from the Hopkins<br />\nadministration since my arrival<br />\nfour years ago. Muller's talk last<br />\nWednesday was refreshing, if<br />\nonly because he expressed a<br />\nsincere and enthusiastic interest<br />\nby coming to talk with the<br />\nstudents. He spoke, in my<br />\nestimation, only in positive<br />\nterms of constructing an<br />\ninnovative, new Hopkins.<br />\nGulin's article quotes Muller<br />\nseveral times; however, the<br />\nquotes are so flagrantly slanted<br />\nthey question Gulin's credibility.<br />\nIt would appear to me that<br />\nGulin could have grasped the<br />\ngeneral tone of the discussion a<br />\nlittle better. His rhetoric is<br />\nmatched only by his negativism.<br />\nDuring the approximately two<br />\nhours that Muller spoke, he<br />\nanswered questions asked by<br />\nthose present. The mood was<br />\none of building. Muller<br />\nexplained how Hopkins was in a<br />\ntransition period, a time when<br />\nthe feuding of last spring could<br />\nbe put aside and the future<br />\ncould be looked toward with<br />\nnew ideas.<br />\nMuller mentioned that<br />\nHopkins was about to reach a<br />\npoint where it would either be a<br />\ngreat University with innovative<br />\napproaches to education or it<br />\nwould just continue existing,<br />\nfollowing a pattern set in 1876.<br />\nI don't fault Gulin his article.<br />\nI think it stems from not having<br />\na proper perspective of<br />\nHopkins's past and potential<br /><br />\nfuture.

The country that gave American<br />\nexpatriates a home felt the magic of their spirited<br />\nprime minister taking a 22 year old wife. With<br />\nthe voting age lowered to 18, a flow of legislation<br />\nwas directed toward the new constituency.<br />\nThe spirit of the country became the spirit of<br />\nyouth.

But if you're<br />\ngoing to Canada and look a bit scruffy, the<br />\nimmigration people might not care that you're<br />\nyoung. We had an experience at the Canadian<br />\nborder recently that doesn't jive with the<br />\npulp-made image.<br />\nArriving by bus, we filled out the form they<br />\ngave us and waited in line before the immigration<br />\nofficial; a neat, young man sitting behind an old<br />\ndesk. When we reached the front of the line, the<br />\nofficial took our form and carefully read it. He<br />\nreached the bottom of the page and looked up at<br />\n'<br />\n.us. His eyes were evasive, but his expression was<br />\npleasant enough, if perhaps a little serious. \"Have<br />\nyou ever used drugs before?\" he asked, his voice<br />\nneutral.<br />\nDave Pickall is a Junior<br /><br />\nWe only hesitated for a moment, for we sensed<br />\nno danger. \"Yes, we've smoked some grass a few<br />\ntimes: some marijuana.\"<br />\nThe young official looked down at theform.<br />\nWhen he spoke again, his voice was haughty.<br />\n\"I'm sorry, but I'll have to refer your case to a<br />\nhigher official. This is out of my jurisdiction.\"<br />\n\"Progressive-thinking Canada,\" we mumbled.<br />\n\"This can't be happening.\" But the shit had<br />\nindeed hit the fan. When we finally emerged<br />\nfrom the immigration building two hours later,<br />\nwe carried a deportation notice. In the words of<br />\nthe law, we were persons \"of the prohibited class<br />\nof persons described in paragraph (d)of section 5<br />\nof the Immigration Act in that you are persons<br />\nwho admit having committed a crime involving<br />\nmoral turpitude, namely the unlawful possession<br />\nof a narcotic.\" We were surprised at being<br />\ndeported for admitting that we had smoked a<br />\nlittle weed at indefinite times in our past, and<br />\nnot knowing the nuances of 'turpitude,' we<br />\nthought that our crime must have been the moral<br />\nturpitude violation. We found a dictionary that<br />\nnight somewhere in Montana.<br />\nBack in the US of A, we phoned the Canadian<br />\nembassy for comment on Canada's policy toward<br />\nmarijuana smokers wishing to visit Canada.

At<br />\nSwarthmore, last Saturday, the<br />\nBlue Jay booters forgot this<br />\nwarning for one single minute<br />\nand it cost them not only a<br />\nvictory but a share of first place<br />\nin the Middle Atlantic<br />\nCon ference.<br />\nSwa, thmore's 2-1<br />\ndouble-overtime victory featured<br />\nvery even .play and several good<br />\nchances for both sides in the<br />\nopening forty minutes. The best<br />\nof these was a booming drive<br />\nfrom twenty yards out by<br />\nRoberto Arguero that<br />\nSwarthmore goalie Galli dove for<br />\nand tipped away.<br />\nSwarthmore's closest attempt<br />\nwas a looping thirty yard shot<br />\nby Art Philpotts that landed on<br /><br />\nthe crossbar and sailed out of<br />\nbounds.<br />\nWith only two minutes to<br />\nplay in the first half, though,<br />\nHopkins finally broke the ice<br />\nwhen Arguer\u00b0 dribbled down<br />\nthe left side and crossed<br />\nperfectly, low and at the feet of<br />\nMark Heller whose short shot hit<br />\nthe unguarded net. It was<br />\nHeller's first goal of the year and<br />\nthe first scored by any player<br />\nother than senior Scott Tyner.<br />\nHopkins broke up the ensuing'<br />\nkickoff but lost the ball to the<br />\nGarnets' Mike Atkinson, who<br />\nraced up the field and sent a<br />\ntwenty yard shot past _goalie<br />\nKeith Naunheim with only<br />\nseventeen seconds left in the<br />\nhalf.<br /><br />\nThe Jays had lost both their<br />\nlead and their momentum and<br />\nwere forced to start all over in<br />\nthe second half.<br />\nThe second half was exciting,<br />\nwith both sides having near<br />\nmisses. Naunheim made a great<br />\ndiving save of a short head ball<br />\nlate in the third period, while<br />\nGalli stopped Tyner's breakaway<br />\nwith but two minutes left in<br />\nregulation time.<br />\nIn overtime, the Jays were<br />\nforced into a defensive position<br />\nas Swarthmore had numerous<br />\nopportunities to put in the<br />\ntie-breaker. Naunheim once<br />\nagain made several great saves,<br />\nbut could not prevent Art<br />\nPhilpotts from from converting a<br />\nMike Atkinson pass.<br /><br />\n--*<br /><br />\nCross-Country Team<br />\nEvens Season at 2-2<br />\nLast Saturday afternoon, the<br />\nHopkins' cross-country team<br />\nengaged in a triangular meet<br />\nagainst Drexel and host college<br />\nHaverford, losing to both<br />\n(though Haverford only won by<br />\ntwo points, 27-29). This evened<br />\nHopkins' record for the season<br />\nat two wins and two losses.<br />\nThe top Hopkins' runner in<br />\nthis meet was Russ Dubiel who<br />\nfinished third behind two of<br />\nDrexel's runners (first against<br />\nHaverford). Jeff Greve was the<br />\nnext Hopkins' runner to place,<br />\nfinishing seventh officially,<br />\nthough this was good enough for<br />\nsecond place against Haverford.<br />\nNevertheless, Hopkins could<br />\nnot continue to do well against<br />\nHaverford, as three Haverford<br /><br />\nmen finished before (and two<br />\ndirectly after) Hopkins' next<br />\nplacer, freshman Dave Piccoli,<br />\nwho finished fourteenth. Other<br />\nmen placing for Hopkins were<br />\nChuck Mick (18th)and Ira Luke<br />\n(19th place).<br />\nThough the team had never<br />\nexpected to beat Drexel, they<br />\nwere a bit upset over losing to<br />\nHaverford. According to one<br />\nmember on the team, the results<br />\nmight have been much better<br />\nhad sophomore Austin Doyle<br />\nbeen able to run. Austin is the<br />\nteam's third best runner, but is<br />\ncurrently recovering from an<br />\nankle injury. Doyle is expected<br />\nto run once again, though, in<br />\nthis afternoon's meet against<br />\nGettysburg on their course.<br />\nvar<br /><br />\nPEABODY AT HOPKINS<br />\npresented by<br /><br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\nThursday, October 21, 12 noon<br />\nGarrett Room, Eisenhower Library, Homewood Campus<br /><br />\nROOSEVELT NEWSON, JR., pianist<br />\nPerforming a Program of<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nBeethoven and Schumann<br />\ndr<br /><br />\nIHAR,LEY'S<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1 11111<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nV./<br /><br />\n\u2022.1<br />\n.<br />\n':!.<br />\n..If<br />\nir 111111111<br /><br />\n...<br />\nI<br />\n01\\<br /><br />\nB&amp;M<br />\n31st &amp; Guilford<br />\nI<br />\n.<br /><br />\nFamous<br /><br />\nADMISSION FREE<br /><br />\nPREGNANT?<br /><br />\n. ,.<br /><br />\n, Original Sub<br />\nguaranteed to Maul the Mundties<br />\nHARLEY'S 3111 St. Paul<br />\nOpen Late<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nFor Our.<br /><br />\nyou have decided to terminate<br />\nyour pregnancy we can help you.<br />\n(Abortions are legal in New York State<br />\nand residency is not required).<br />\nWe wort on a STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL<br />\nbasis and there is NO REFERRAL FEE<br />\nfor our services.<br />\nWe will refer you the best and least<br />\nexpensive facilities possible, absolutely<br />\nFREE OF CHARGE.<br />\nPrices from:<br />\n$150 UP TO 14 WEEKS PREGNANCY<br /><br />\nFor information Call:<br /><br />\nsomewhat more expensive for more<br />\nadvanced pregnancies according to facilities.<br /><br />\n(212)873.3492<br /><br />\nSubmarine<br /><br />\nor write to:<br /><br />\nWOMEN'S<br />\nORIENTATION CENTER<br /><br />\nSandwiches<br />\n9a.rn.-1 a.m.<br /><br />\nHopkins'Harry Stringer(20)carries on a sweep.<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\n257 Central Park West<br />\nNew York.<br />\nA MON MONT OINANIZATKON<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n0,<br />\n5.,\u00b0 \u2022<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n. 0,......\u2022 #...% . .<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n0. .\u2022<br />\nr...\u202211\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n,,_(\u2022;0\u20229,,,,..<br />\n\u2022- -\u2022 .4,<br />\n.. s\u2022 ..\u2022 .. ?\u2022 \u2022<br />\n\u00b0 \u00b0'<br /><br />\nOctober 22 &amp; 23<br /><br />\nJaimie Brockett,folk musician,<br />\nentertainer and song stylist<br />\nShows at 9:30, 11 p.m. &amp; 12:30 a.m.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40573, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "40f6b8d0-241f-4f86-8013-0662f9b6da7d", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14089-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14089, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "4a6c10f6-cf6f-466a-b423-f241703622ae", "url": "/node/14089"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "d92f03f2-fa07-42ed-8c37-6ea985014951"}]}
