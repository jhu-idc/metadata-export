Once registered as<br />\nlobbyists, they will spread out<br />\nover Capital Hill to argue their<br />\ncases personally to Senators and<br />\nCongressmens about newsperson's<br />\nrights, minimum wage for<br />\nstudents, airline discount fares,<br />\nand other issues.<br />\nThe NSL originated out of the<br />\nexperience of individuals who<br />\nlobbied during the Cambodian<br />\ninvation in 1970 who recognized<br />\nthe need and potential to<br />\nmobilize students. The<br />\nmovement expanded from a<br />\nstrong community program at<br />\nBerkley. into the California<br />\nStudent Lobby and finally into<br />\nthe NSL.<br />\nThe major problem of the NSL<br />\nitself is money. It is staffed by 15<br />\nfull time and 5 part time<br />\ndevotees\u2014interns, recent<br />\ngraduates and a few professionals.<br />\nTheir pay barely,covers living<br />\nexpenses. The primary source of<br />\n<br />\nincome is from the 220 member<br />\ncolleges. Each contributes $50<br />\nplus one cent per student. Staff<br />\nmembers hope many more<br />\ncolleges will join, including<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe NSL decides what issues<br />\nto focus on by initiating student<br />\nreferendums. The top ten issues<br />\nare then chosen. A few of the<br />\nstaff professed that they become<br />\nbetter informed than their<br />\nCongressman on these particular.<br />\nissues since Congressmen must<br />\ndevote.their attention to such a<br />\nwide range of issues.<br />\nThe most fashionable issue<br />\ntoday is the protection of<br />\nnewsperson's rights. 37 bills are<br />\nbeing proposed in Congress, yet<br />\nmany of these are qualified by<br />\nsuch clauses as \"forced disclosure<br />\nto federal authorities is<br />\npermissible when then the<br />\ninformation is (1) relevant to a<br />\nspecific crime, (2) unobtainable.<br />\nby other means, (3) of<br />\ncompelling and overiding<br />\nnational interest.\"<br />\nThe NSL is pushing for<br />\nunqualified protection. Sen. Alan<br />\nCranston (D-Calif.) has.<br />\n<br />\nintroduced such a bill. He said it<br />\nwould \"extend news protection<br />\nto the state and local levels where<br />\nmost of the controversy has<br />\narisen.\" Today only 17 states<br />\nhave such \"shield laws\" for<br />\nnewspersons.<br />\nThe NSL is also lobbying for<br />\ndescriminatory youth fare<br />\ndiscounts, while simultaneously<br />\nlobbying against the McDonald's<br />\nbacked discriminatory<br />\nsub-minimum wage bill. It<br />\nappears that students want to be<br />\ndiscriminated against in order to<br />\npay less, but treated as adults in<br />\norder to be paid the same.<br />\nIn December the Civil<br />\nAeronautics Board voted to<br />\nabolish youth and family air<br />\nfares, ruling that they were<br />\ndiscriminatory and unreasonable.<br />\nBut it hasn't set a date for the<br />\nban. First it must determine<br />\nwhether all regular fares should<br />\nbe adjusted to reflect the savings<br />\nof the airlines in the absence of<br />\nyouth fares.<br />\nThe NSL is lobbying to<br />\nreinstate standby discounts for<br />\nyouth fare and to introduce it for<br />\nthe elderly.

Muller has held to his pledge, and recently<br />\nauthorized that an unrestricted grant of $200,000 be<br />\nused for financial aid.<br />\nAgain, yesterday, Muller announced plans to establish a $7.5 million endowment, which would in effect<br />\nserve as a buffer against further tuition increases.<br />\nWe applaud Muller for his responsible actions on behalf of hard-pressed students at Hopkins. We also note<br />\nwith concern the mystifying developments which surround the proposed Student Employment Service.<br />\nThese developments present an object lesson on the<br />\nfine art of administrative buck-passing, which John<br />\nRiina has apparently elevated into an exact science. As<br />\nlate as a week ago. Riina, who is Director. of AdMissions and Financial Aid, was to have been responsible<br />\nfor the Center. By that time, the one person selected<br />\nto head the Center, from three who were interviewed,<br />\nhad decided to take another position. Presumably, the<br />\nsearch for a Director will continue, and the March 1,<br />\noperationality deadline would be met.<br />\nSomehow, this week Riina was able to pass the project off to Personnel Director J. Lyon Rogers. Yesterday. Riina said,<br />\nwill not be in my office for the moment: maybe sometime in the future we can take it<br />\non.- There have already been far too many delays in<br />\nthis project. The student Employment Service should<br />\nbe established in an office where service to students is<br />\nnot shunned. and it should be made operational as<br />\nsoon as possible.<br />\n<br />\n\"Children of the Gods\" parts are interesting, but others are embarrassing<br />\nBy SUE WOOLH1SER<br />\nDifferent is not necessarily good, it is<br />\nnot even necessarily interesting, though it<br />\nmay be both. An innovative theatrical<br />\napproach can be both interesting and well<br />\ndone, but it can not simply assume these<br />\nends because of the style of production.<br />\nThe accomplishments of a particular<br />\npresentation should be considered<br />\naccording to the degree of the<br />\nachievement of its own expectations.<br />\n\"Children of the Gods,\" performed by<br />\nt he N.Y. based ensemble Shalako, is a<br />\nplay based on four Greek tragedies,<br />\nemphasizing a modern interpretation and<br />\npresentation of the fall of the House of<br />\nAtreus. The presentation is different. It's<br />\ninteresting when the methods work well.<br />\nGenerally they do work well and<br />\nprovide an exciting play to watch and to<br />\nfigure out who is killing who and why.(It<br />\nmay even send some people to their Edith<br />\nHamilton or Bullfinch's for correct<br />\nrelationships.) However, the techniques<br />\ndo not always work well; and the delicate<br />\nbalance between the classic stories, their<br />\n<br />\nmodern reading, and the possible truth<br />\nbetween them is undermined when they<br />\ndo not strengthen the presentation. The<br />\nrisk in this sort of theatre is whether the<br />\nplay itself can withstand all the staging it<br />\nis so intimately connected with, and still<br />\ngive the audience the experience of seeing<br />\na play and not a living theatre workshop.<br />\nThe company has made a fortunate<br />\nchoice of material in selecting Aeschylus's<br />\n\"Agamennon\" and Euripides's \"Electra,\"<br />\n\"Orestes\" and \"Iphigenia in Aulis.\" Their<br />\nmost obvious intention is to present the<br />\npersonal agony of people who love and<br />\nhate, and what better choice than the<br />\nGreek family of the House of Arteus<br />\nwhere fathers kill children, wives kill<br />\nhusbands, and children kill mothers?<br />\nPolitical and historic elements are<br />\ndisregarded in order to emphasize the<br />\nmoments of personal confrontation.<br />\nUnderstandably a great deal of controlled<br />\nand uncontrolled hysterics go no but there<br />\nare also gentler scenes between brothers,<br />\nhusband and wife, between father and<br />\nchild, and between children, as they<br />\n<br />\nbecome caught up in events they can't<br />\nseem to control or understand. The cast<br />\nhandles all these turbulent emotions with<br />\nthe proper balance of intensity and<br />\nbewilderment. The fine personal<br />\nperformances help provide the illusion of<br />\nreal people despite the extreme<br />\ncircumstantial conditions.<br />\nThe events concerning Electra, Orestes<br />\nand lphiginia are interspersed with events<br />\nof the main Agamemnon plot?<br />\nsimultaneously presenting the<br />\nbackground stories and the main story.<br />\nThis flashback technique is appropriate to<br />\nthe emotional emphasis and to the basic<br />\nintertwinings of the plots. It may take the<br />\nviewer some time to grasp why they are<br />\nall so upset, but eventually the flashbacks<br />\nbegin to make sense.

Loyola had<br />\ntriumphed 94-90 eight days<br />\nbefore at Homewood,as the Jays<br />\ngave perhaps their most<br />\nlackluster performance of the<br />\nseason. However, Hopkins more<br />\nthan made up for the deficiency<br />\nin the rematch.<br />\nThe visitors jumped out to an<br />\nearly lead against the<br />\nGreyhounds, saw the edge<br />\nevaporate at the start of the<br />\nsecond half and then outplayed<br />\ntheir hosts down the stretch for<br />\nthe well-earned victory. For<br />\nwhile Loyola was gaining points<br />\nthrough a full-court press, they<br />\nwere also accumulating fouls, and<br />\nthis eventually proved their<br />\nundoing.<br />\nThe chief beneficiary of the<br />\nGreyhound overaggressiveness<br />\nwas Hopkins center Chuck<br />\n<br />\nLaBerge, who converted 10 of 12<br />\nfrom the charity stripe and tallied<br />\n16 points. Overall, the Jays were<br />\n23 of 30 from the foul line, while<br />\nLoyola could manage just 8 of 9.<br />\nCaroms<br />\nBill Jews, playing his best<br />\nbasketball in recent memory, led<br />\nthe victors with 20<br />\npoints\u2014connecting on 9 of 16<br />\nfloor shots and garnering 11<br />\nrebounds. Greg DeLong added 10<br />\ncaroms and 9 points, while Paul<br />\nSpence chipped in with 12.

This year's<br />\nteam also gathered the most<br />\npoints in a dual meet and in one<br />\n<br />\nseason. In the twelve season<br />\nmeets, 69 individual matches<br />\nwere won, six more than the<br />\n1968-69 team.<br />\nThe team as a whole has<br />\ndemonstrated a great<br />\nimprovement in Hopkins<br />\nwrestling. Only sixteen teams will<br />\ncompete this year, however, just<br />\nas the Jays have impioved greatly,<br />\nso has the competition. A<br />\nnumber of weight classes have<br />\nreturning champions.<br />\nFreshman Gary Murza has the<br />\n<br />\nteam's best chance for a first<br />\nplace. Murza broke two<br />\nindividual records, one for the<br />\nmost wins in one season (11)and<br />\none for the most team points<br />\n(56) in one season. During this<br />\nseason, Gary lost to the fourth.<br />\nplace champion 3-2; This was<br />\nafter a mere two weeks of<br />\npractice. He defeated the third<br />\nplace champion in a dual meet<br />\nwhile the first and second place<br />\nchampion tp contend with.<br />\nClark Kingery and Craig<br />\n<br />\nStevens both display 9-3 season<br />\nrecords; Rob Fink, an 8-3 record.<br />\nRob probably has the toughest<br />\nweight class because of the<br />\nnumber of returning champs. He<br />\nset a new record for the number<br />\nof near fall (3 points) with eight.<br />\nDave Mulock with a 7-5 record<br />\nand Greg Goldman will find their<br />\ncompetition just as tough with<br />\npast returning placers.<br />\nThe two lightweights, Ron<br />\nPucillc\u2022 and Mike Privitera, might<br />\nfind a number of equally<br />\n<br />\nmatched opponents to face.<br />\nPucillo surpassed the previous<br />\nrecord for the most escapes with<br />\neighteen, Privitera had 11. Mike<br />\nalso had the fastest pin this season<br />\nwhen he put his foe on his back<br />\nin 40 seconds.<br />\nHopes are set for one of the<br />\ntop five places in the<br />\ntournament.

Fitzpatrick<br />\nexplained that \"because a<br />\nconduct code is a matter of<br />\nconcern to students, it would be<br />\nmore appropriate for a student to<br />\nhead the committee.\"<br />\nServing on the committee will<br />\nbe three undergraduates, two<br />\ngraduate students, and two<br />\nfaculty members. Committee<br />\nmembers will be announced in<br />\nthe near future.<br />\nA new code will provide two<br />\ncourses of action for students<br />\nwho have committed campus<br /><br />\ndiscipline violations.

Fitzpatrick stated that<br />\n\"the University has perhaps an<br />\nobligation to protect the<br />\nUniversity community. Though<br />\nwe are not legally obligated, I<br />\nfeel it is a better protection of<br />\nstudents to develop safeguards.\"<br />\nConcerning problems off<br />\ncampus, Fitzpatrick said that<br />\n\"the University has no right to<br />\ninterfere in that area.

The<br />\nmovement expanded from a<br />\nstrong community program at<br />\nBerkley. into the California<br />\nStudent Lobby and finally into<br />\nthe NSL.<br />\nThe major problem of the NSL<br />\nitself is money. It is staffed by 15<br />\nfull time and 5 part time<br />\ndevotees\u2014interns, recent<br />\ngraduates and a few professionals.<br />\nTheir pay barely,covers living<br />\nexpenses. The primary source of<br /><br />\nincome is from the 220 member<br />\ncolleges. Each contributes $50<br />\nplus one cent per student. Staff<br />\nmembers hope many more<br />\ncolleges will join, including<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe NSL decides what issues<br />\nto focus on by initiating student<br />\nreferendums. The top ten issues<br />\nare then chosen. A few of the<br />\nstaff professed that they become<br />\nbetter informed than their<br />\nCongressman on these particular.<br />\nissues since Congressmen must<br />\ndevote.their attention to such a<br />\nwide range of issues.<br />\nThe most fashionable issue<br />\ntoday is the protection of<br />\nnewsperson's rights. 37 bills are<br />\nbeing proposed in Congress, yet<br />\nmany of these are qualified by<br />\nsuch clauses as \"forced disclosure<br />\nto federal authorities is<br />\npermissible when then the<br />\ninformation is (1) relevant to a<br />\nspecific crime, (2) unobtainable.<br />\nby other means, (3) of<br />\ncompelling and overiding<br />\nnational interest.\"<br />\nThe NSL is pushing for<br />\nunqualified protection. Sen. Alan<br />\nCranston (D-Calif.) has.<br /><br />\nintroduced such a bill. He said it<br />\nwould \"extend news protection<br />\nto the state and local levels where<br />\nmost of the controversy has<br />\narisen.\" Today only 17 states<br />\nhave such \"shield laws\" for<br />\nnewspersons.<br />\nThe NSL is also lobbying for<br />\ndescriminatory youth fare<br />\ndiscounts, while simultaneously<br />\nlobbying against the McDonald's<br />\nbacked discriminatory<br />\nsub-minimum wage bill. It<br />\nappears that students want to be<br />\ndiscriminated against in order to<br />\npay less, but treated as adults in<br />\norder to be paid the same.<br />\nIn December the Civil<br />\nAeronautics Board voted to<br />\nabolish youth and family air<br />\nfares, ruling that they were<br />\ndiscriminatory and unreasonable.<br />\nBut it hasn't set a date for the<br />\nban. First it must determine<br />\nwhether all regular fares should<br />\nbe adjusted to reflect the savings<br />\nof the airlines in the absence of<br />\nyouth fares.<br />\nThe NSL is lobbying to<br />\nreinstate standby discounts for<br />\nyouth fare and to introduce it for<br />\nthe elderly. It has made some<br /><br />\nheadway in this effort.<br />\nCongressman Harley Staggers<br />\n(D\u2014 W.

JUST AS I'M BEGINNING TO ENJOY MYSELF?'<br /><br />\nWhen Steven Muller last October called for a $300<br />\nhike in tuition, bringing Hopkins into the $3000 per<br />\nannum plateau of other Eastern prestige universities,<br />\nhe promised a concommitant increase in student financial aid. Muller has held to his pledge, and recently<br />\nauthorized that an unrestricted grant of $200,000 be<br />\nused for financial aid.<br />\nAgain, yesterday, Muller announced plans to establish a $7.5 million endowment, which would in effect<br />\nserve as a buffer against further tuition increases.<br />\nWe applaud Muller for his responsible actions on behalf of hard-pressed students at Hopkins. We also note<br />\nwith concern the mystifying developments which surround the proposed Student Employment Service.<br />\nThese developments present an object lesson on the<br />\nfine art of administrative buck-passing, which John<br />\nRiina has apparently elevated into an exact science. As<br />\nlate as a week ago. Riina, who is Director. of AdMissions and Financial Aid, was to have been responsible<br />\nfor the Center. By that time, the one person selected<br />\nto head the Center, from three who were interviewed,<br />\nhad decided to take another position. Presumably, the<br />\nsearch for a Director will continue, and the March 1,<br />\noperationality deadline would be met.<br />\nSomehow, this week Riina was able to pass the project off to Personnel Director J. Lyon Rogers. Yesterday. Riina said,<br />\nwill not be in my office for the moment: maybe sometime in the future we can take it<br />\non.- There have already been far too many delays in<br />\nthis project. The student Employment Service should<br />\nbe established in an office where service to students is<br />\nnot shunned. and it should be made operational as<br />\nsoon as possible.<br /><br />\n\"Children of the Gods\" parts are interesting, but others are embarrassing<br />\nBy SUE WOOLH1SER<br />\nDifferent is not necessarily good, it is<br />\nnot even necessarily interesting, though it<br />\nmay be both. An innovative theatrical<br />\napproach can be both interesting and well<br />\ndone, but it can not simply assume these<br />\nends because of the style of production.<br />\nThe accomplishments of a particular<br />\npresentation should be considered<br />\naccording to the degree of the<br />\nachievement of its own expectations.<br />\n\"Children of the Gods,\" performed by<br />\nt he N.Y. based ensemble Shalako, is a<br />\nplay based on four Greek tragedies,<br />\nemphasizing a modern interpretation and<br />\npresentation of the fall of the House of<br />\nAtreus. The presentation is different. It's<br />\ninteresting when the methods work well.<br />\nGenerally they do work well and<br />\nprovide an exciting play to watch and to<br />\nfigure out who is killing who and why.(It<br />\nmay even send some people to their Edith<br />\nHamilton or Bullfinch's for correct<br />\nrelationships.) However, the techniques<br />\ndo not always work well; and the delicate<br />\nbalance between the classic stories, their<br /><br />\nmodern reading, and the possible truth<br />\nbetween them is undermined when they<br />\ndo not strengthen the presentation. The<br />\nrisk in this sort of theatre is whether the<br />\nplay itself can withstand all the staging it<br />\nis so intimately connected with, and still<br />\ngive the audience the experience of seeing<br />\na play and not a living theatre workshop.<br />\nThe company has made a fortunate<br />\nchoice of material in selecting Aeschylus's<br />\n\"Agamennon\" and Euripides's \"Electra,\"<br />\n\"Orestes\" and \"Iphigenia in Aulis.\" Their<br />\nmost obvious intention is to present the<br />\npersonal agony of people who love and<br />\nhate, and what better choice than the<br />\nGreek family of the House of Arteus<br />\nwhere fathers kill children, wives kill<br />\nhusbands, and children kill mothers?<br />\nPolitical and historic elements are<br />\ndisregarded in order to emphasize the<br />\nmoments of personal confrontation.<br />\nUnderstandably a great deal of controlled<br />\nand uncontrolled hysterics go no but there<br />\nare also gentler scenes between brothers,<br />\nhusband and wife, between father and<br />\nchild, and between children, as they<br /><br />\nbecome caught up in events they can't<br />\nseem to control or understand. The cast<br />\nhandles all these turbulent emotions with<br />\nthe proper balance of intensity and<br />\nbewilderment. The fine personal<br />\nperformances help provide the illusion of<br />\nreal people despite the extreme<br />\ncircumstantial conditions.<br />\nThe events concerning Electra, Orestes<br />\nand lphiginia are interspersed with events<br />\nof the main Agamemnon plot?<br />\nsimultaneously presenting the<br />\nbackground stories and the main story.<br />\nThis flashback technique is appropriate to<br />\nthe emotional emphasis and to the basic<br />\nintertwinings of the plots. It may take the<br />\nviewer some time to grasp why they are<br />\nall so upset, but eventually the flashbacks<br />\nbegin to make sense. This bewilderment<br />\nconcerning what has happened may profit<br />\nthe viewer by forcing him to share in the<br />\ncharacters' confusion while giving him<br />\nsomething to do while all the ravings are<br />\ngoing on.<br />\nThe viewer who is already familiar with<br />\nthe plots is confused for a different<br /><br />\n_Patized, passionate beauty on film<br />\nBy CRAIG NANKIN<br />\nThree beautiful women, Scarlet, Carla,<br />\nand Sandra: smiling, smirking sensual.<br />\nThey are passionate', pained; clothed and<br />\nnude. They stand windswept on a beach,<br />\nrecline bare beneath a tree. They are the<br />\nsubjects of Wingate Paine's best-selling<br />\nbook of photographic feminine beauty.<br />\nIt took Harvey Vincent one year to<br />\nadapt these photographs into one<br />\nfive-minute film.<br />\n'At the outset I know only two<br />\nthings,'. said Vincent, \"one, that the<br />\nmovie should be no longer than five<br />\nminutes'? and two, that I wanted classical<br />\nmusic in the background.\"<br />\nThe black-and-white short was<br />\nexcellently conceived and runs exactly<br />\nfive minutes, but instead of a classical<br />\nsoundtrack, it moves gracefully to the<br />\nImpressionistic strains of Claude Debussy.<br />\nVincent achieved his goal with a series<br />\nof tine zoom-ins and slow fades. bringing<br />\nto life these three beauties with such skill<br />\nthat it becomes difficult to believe the<br />\nfilm was a year in making. It has been<br /><br />\nreason. For anyone familiar with Greek<br />\ntragedy or the literature of Greece and<br />\nRome, a one-sided presentation of the<br />\ntrauma of the characters gives the<br />\nimpression that they aren't quite acting<br />\nlike themselves. This confusion, obviously<br />\naimed at the emotional focus, is not as<br />\neffective for the viewer who knows there<br />\nwas also more than this.<br />\nThe staging of the events is very<br />\nphysical (as are the costumes). The<br />\ntumbling, dancing, fighting, running,<br />\nriving, and grinding not only keeps the<br />\nproduction moving and adds contrast to<br />\nall the speeches but succeeds in<br />\nexpressing the character's frustration. The<br />\nmovement is interesting and well<br />\nchoreographed. Even though the fluidity<br />\nof movements helps them seem tragically<br />\nfated, occassionally the staging is so neat<br />\nthey look like puppets instead of real<br />\nsufferers.<br />\nThe set of the play is an intregal part<br />\nof the staging which attempts to place<br />\nthese fated Greeks.

Loyola had<br />\ntriumphed 94-90 eight days<br />\nbefore at Homewood,as the Jays<br />\ngave perhaps their most<br />\nlackluster performance of the<br />\nseason. However, Hopkins more<br />\nthan made up for the deficiency<br />\nin the rematch.<br />\nThe visitors jumped out to an<br />\nearly lead against the<br />\nGreyhounds, saw the edge<br />\nevaporate at the start of the<br />\nsecond half and then outplayed<br />\ntheir hosts down the stretch for<br />\nthe well-earned victory. For<br />\nwhile Loyola was gaining points<br />\nthrough a full-court press, they<br />\nwere also accumulating fouls, and<br />\nthis eventually proved their<br />\nundoing.<br />\nThe chief beneficiary of the<br />\nGreyhound overaggressiveness<br />\nwas Hopkins center Chuck<br /><br />\nLaBerge, who converted 10 of 12<br />\nfrom the charity stripe and tallied<br />\n16 points. Overall, the Jays were<br />\n23 of 30 from the foul line, while<br />\nLoyola could manage just 8 of 9.<br />\nCaroms<br />\nBill Jews, playing his best<br />\nbasketball in recent memory, led<br />\nthe victors with 20<br />\npoints\u2014connecting on 9 of 16<br />\nfloor shots and garnering 11<br />\nrebounds. Greg DeLong added 10<br />\ncaroms and 9 points, while Paul<br />\nSpence chipped in with 12. But<br />\nthe triumph was not without its<br />\nanxious moments.<br />\nWith 10 minutes to play and<br />\nHopkins leading by 60-57,<br />\nLaBerge accidentally placed an<br />\nelbow in Jew's right eye, and the<br />\nresultant gash\u2014which later<br />\nrequired three stitches\u2014sent Bill<br />\nto the bench for six minutes.<br />\nKey Buckets<br />\nIt appeared for awhile that the<br />\ninjury might cost the Blue.Jays<br />\nthe game, but Coach Rupert<br />\nordered a deliberate offense to<br />\n-compensate for Jews' absence<br />\nand the strategy paid off.<br />\nDeLong and Spence chipped up<br />\nwith key buckets, while John<br />\nRutter and Bobby Freedman<br />\ncame up with crucial steals to<br /><br />\nB-ball and wrestling<br />\ntighten BIA races<br />\nBy STEVEN BROWN<br />\nThe second semester<br />\nintramural athletic program got<br />\noff to a great start with close to<br />\n70 wrestlers showing up for the<br />\nmatches held at the beginning of<br />\nFebruary. Sylvester House<br />\noutclassed the other dorms and<br />\nTEP nosed out GAM for the<br />\nfraternity title.<br />\nIn the dormitory league,<br />\nSylvester picked up 53 match<br />\npoints to runnerup Gildersleeve's<br />\n34. Hollander placed third with<br />\n27 points and Jennings managed<br />\n15. Royce, leaders after first<br />\nsemester, could only salvage 7<br />\npoints and the race tightened<br />\nconsiderably.<br />\nRoyce still holds a slight edge<br />\nwith 150 trophy points, followed<br />\nby Hollander's 148 and<br />\nGildersleeve's 139 1/2 points.<br />\nSylvester jumped from<br />\nnext-to-last place into sixth place<br />\nafter their strong showing.<br />\nIn winning the fraternity title,<br />\nTEP also picked up 53 match<br />\npoints. However, GAM finished<br />\nstrongly and accumulated 50 1/2<br />\nSig Ep's 24 points were good<br />\nenough for third and ATO placec<br />\na distant fourth with 13 points<br />\nTEP has forged into a<br />\ncommanding lead in total points<br />\nwith 265 1/2. ATO is way back<br />\nwith 186 and DU remained in<br />\nthird place with 168 1/2. Sig Ep,<br />\nstill in fourth, gained on DU and<br />\nnow trail by only 6 1/2 points.<br />\nGAM also picked up ground and<br />\ntrail Sig Ep by only 5 points.<br />\nThe BIA basketball season has<br />\njust passed the half-way mark.<br />\nTwo teams from each of the four<br />\nleagues enter into the post-season<br />\nplayoffs. In the opening round,<br />\nfirst place teams play second<br />\nplace teams of a different league,<br />\n\u2022 with the best first place record<br /><br />\npairing off with the worst second<br />\nplace record. The quarter finals<br />\nare scheduled to be played at 1<br />\npm on Saturday, March 10th.<br />\nThe semi-finals are to be held on<br />\nthe 19th and the finals two days<br />\nlater. Therefore, the season will<br />\nbe completed before Spring<br />\nVacation.<br />\nApproximately three more<br />\nweeks remain in the regular<br />\nseason and certain teams have<br />\nestablished themselves as definite<br />\nleague. powers. Gildersleeve<br />\nremained undefeated in the<br />\ndormitory league after its<br />\nshowdown with previously<br />\nunbeaten Royce, which in turn<br />\nfell into a second place tie with<br />\nJennings.<br />\nDU, unbeaten in League No. 1,<br />\npresents a big and strong front<br />\nline to opponents. ATO, Italia<br />\nand Chauvinis are all deadlocked<br />\nin second with one loss apiece.<br />\nLeague No. 3 still has two<br />\nunbeaten teams, TEP and the<br />\nGolden Plow. The Plow features<br />\na well-balanced, experienced<br />\nteam, and is definitely the best<br />\nindependent squad. TEP, a quick<br />\nand well-coached team, is<br />\napproaching the March 5th<br />\nshowdown date with thoughts oi<br />\nwinning everything.<br />\nIn League No. 2 Crowson<br />\nCrows and BETA remair.<br />\nundefeated. Their showdown,<br />\nlike TEP's and the Golden<br />\nPlow's, is similarly scheduled for<br />\nthe 5th of March.<br />\nPrior to the Spring Recess the<br />\nBIA has seven more events<br />\nscheduled. The Swimming and<br />\nHandball/Squash/Paddlebal!<br />\ncompetitions are to be completed<br />\nin February, while Pool,<br />\nPing Pong, Bowling, Badmiton,<br />\nand Volleyball events are planned<br />\nfor March.<br /><br />\npreserve the triumph.<br />\nThe eventual winning hoop<br />\nwas supplied by DeLong on a<br />\n15 -footer with 1:22<br />\nremaining\u2014breaking a 72-72 tie.<br />\nSpence and Freedman then<br />\nadded foul shots in the final 20<br />\nseconds to provide the eventual<br />\nmargin of victory. The keys to<br />\nthe Hopkins triumph were good<br />\nshooting\u2014including 13 of 20<br /><br />\n(65%) from the field in the<br />\nsecond half, a strong zone<br />\ndefense, and a 37-30 rebounding<br />\nedge.<br />\nOne hates to criticize after a<br />\nwinning effort, but the fact<br />\nremains that Hopkins was almost<br />\ntotally dismantled by the Loyola<br />\npress at the start of the second<br />\nhalf. In reality, though, the<br />\nturnovers which ensued were as<br /><br />\nNEWS-LEMER<br /><br />\nmuch attributable to the Blue<br />\nJay ballhandlers as to the<br />\ntenacity of the Greyhound<br />\ndefense.<br />\nHowever, despite being rattled<br />\nby the press, the Blue Jays never<br />\ncollapsed. They never totally lost<br />\ntheir composure, which, in the<br />\ncramped,.almost claustrophobic<br />\nconfines of the Loyola gym,is no<br />\nsmall feat.<br /><br />\nspans<br /><br />\nSwimmers face tough CU squad<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nAt the time of this<br />\npublication, the Hopkins<br />\nswimming team should be in the<br />\nmidst of the Mason-Dixon<br />\nLeague champioships at<br />\nGallaudet College in Washington,<br />\nD.C.<br />\nThe competition began last<br />\nnight and will continue through<br />\ntomorrow. Coach Comfort's<br />\npre-meet attitude is one of<br />\nconfidence mixed with disdain<br />\nfor the procedures used.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are expected to<br />\ndefend their title by winning the<br />\nmeet, but by a slimmer margin<br />\nthan would be indicative of their<br />\nstrength and depth. This is<br />\nbecause of a league rule which<br />\npermits only two entries from<br />\neach school in each event.<br />\nAlthough the other NCAA<br />\nchampionships and all<br />\nMason-Dixon Conference dual<br />\nmeets allow three entries, the<br />\nM.D. championships have stick to<br /><br />\nin<br />\nthe \"antiquated\" two swimmer stroker, Jay Fortner, beat him<br />\nlost<br />\nbut<br />\nyear,<br />\nlast<br />\nNationals<br />\nthe<br />\nrule, designed purposely to<br />\nprevent domination by one team. to him the Conference meet.<br />\nOf Catholic, Coach Comfort<br />\nComfort, who likes to see as<br />\ngood<br />\nmany people as possible perform, said, \"They are very<br />\nblast<br />\nto<br />\nis annoyed by this rule.

In high<br />\nschool, he played both basketball<br />\nand baseball, with his basketball<br />\nteam putting together a 61 game<br />\nwinning streak. Rutter has always<br />\nbeen a winner and finds it<br />\ndifficult to accept defeat here at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nOnly 5'9\", the defensive ace<br />\noften plays with pain in his<br />\nknees, but refuses to stop<br />\nhustling.

In the Labanon Valley<br />\ngame, he held All-American<br />\ncandidate Don Johnson to 13<br />\npoints. Johnson was averaging<br />\nover 27 per game prior to that<br />\ncontest.<br />\nSaid Rupert, \"Bob has<br />\naccepted his role as co-captain by<br />\nproviding the necessary<br />\nleadership.

This year's<br />\nteam also gathered the most<br />\npoints in a dual meet and in one<br /><br />\nseason. In the twelve season<br />\nmeets, 69 individual matches<br />\nwere won, six more than the<br />\n1968-69 team.<br />\nThe team as a whole has<br />\ndemonstrated a great<br />\nimprovement in Hopkins<br />\nwrestling. Only sixteen teams will<br />\ncompete this year, however, just<br />\nas the Jays have impioved greatly,<br />\nso has the competition. A<br />\nnumber of weight classes have<br />\nreturning champions.<br />\nFreshman Gary Murza has the<br /><br />\nteam's best chance for a first<br />\nplace. Murza broke two<br />\nindividual records, one for the<br />\nmost wins in one season (11)and<br />\none for the most team points<br />\n(56) in one season. During this<br />\nseason, Gary lost to the fourth.<br />\nplace champion 3-2; This was<br />\nafter a mere two weeks of<br />\npractice. He defeated the third<br />\nplace champion in a dual meet<br />\nwhile the first and second place<br />\nchampion tp contend with.<br />\nClark Kingery and Craig<br /><br />\nStevens both display 9-3 season<br />\nrecords; Rob Fink, an 8-3 record.<br />\nRob probably has the toughest<br />\nweight class because of the<br />\nnumber of returning champs. He<br />\nset a new record for the number<br />\nof near fall (3 points) with eight.<br />\nDave Mulock with a 7-5 record<br />\nand Greg Goldman will find their<br />\ncompetition just as tough with<br />\npast returning placers.<br />\nThe two lightweights, Ron<br />\nPucillc\u2022 and Mike Privitera, might<br />\nfind a number of equally<br /><br />\nmatched opponents to face.<br />\nPucillo surpassed the previous<br />\nrecord for the most escapes with<br />\neighteen, Privitera had 11.
