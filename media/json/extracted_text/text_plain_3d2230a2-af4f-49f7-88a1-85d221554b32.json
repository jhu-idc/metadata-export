The Jays outplayed Loyola for<br />\n39 minutes and the loss was a heartbreaker.<br />\nExperience, Attack And Defense<br />\n<br />\nWe believe that the steady improvement of the cagers<br />\ncan be attributed to three chief factors.

Bill Civiletti,<br />\nEd Bernstein, Jim Spitznas and Dick Weinstein have all<br />\nbeen taking turns at leading the Hopkins scorers. The last<br />\nbut not least of the factors concerns the new zone defense<br />\nthat the Jays are employing. It is unique and seems to<br />\nthrow the opposition off stride.<br />\nAn interesting and noteworthy set of statistics, coinpiled by John Bridgers, appears on page nine which can<br />\nnot escape our comment. The 5.176 average compiled by<br />\nthe Jay gridders may dent the minds of the individuals,<br />\nwho believe that because one plays a sport, he will necessarily.be an academic failure.

The Jays outplayed Loyola for<br />\n39 minutes and the loss was a heartbreaker.<br />\nExperience, Attack And Defense<br /><br />\nWe believe that the steady improvement of the cagers<br />\ncan be attributed to three chief factors. First, the experience gained by the sophs is now bearing fruit and they are<br />\nmaking fewer mistakes. The second factor is the well<br />\nrounded attack the Jays are now sporting. Bill Civiletti,<br />\nEd Bernstein, Jim Spitznas and Dick Weinstein have all<br />\nbeen taking turns at leading the Hopkins scorers. The last<br />\nbut not least of the factors concerns the new zone defense<br />\nthat the Jays are employing. It is unique and seems to<br />\nthrow the opposition off stride.<br />\nAn interesting and noteworthy set of statistics, coinpiled by John Bridgers, appears on page nine which can<br />\nnot escape our comment. The 5.176 average compiled by<br />\nthe Jay gridders may dent the minds of the individuals,<br />\nwho believe that because one plays a sport, he will necessarily.be an academic failure.
