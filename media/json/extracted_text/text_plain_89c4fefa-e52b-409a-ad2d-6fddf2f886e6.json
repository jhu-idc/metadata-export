With many important proposals<br />\nconcerning undergraduate education likely to come before<br />\nthe CUS this year including pass/fail modifications, an<br />\nABC-no credit grading system and part-time study proposals, the Council should be very carefuly to name only the<br />\nmost highly qualified A n d conscientious students available.<br />\nWhile the SC selections committee no doubt considered<br />\nall the candidates very carefully before it made its nominations, the SC should require that the appointees attend all<br />\nCUS meetings and make reports on those meeting to the<br />\nfull Council. Only in this way can undergraduates be sure<br />\nthat the students appointed to represent them on this crucial committee are doing their job.<br />\nThe Council should also make clear to those whom it<br />\nfinally chooses, that their appointments will 'be revoked if<br />\nthey are found not to be doing their job adequately. For<br />\nthe first time in several years there are four undergraduates<br />\non the CUS and, considering the highly important topics up<br />\nfor consideration this year, students should be vigorously<br />\nand responsibly represented there. Requiring that CUS<br />\nmembers account for their actions on the panel will go a<br />\nlong way toward assuring students of that kind of strong<br />\nrepresentation<br />\n<br />\nSome notes on the passing of the passing scene<br />\nBy B.

The Health<br /><br />\nAssociate is intended as someone<br />\nwho will be able to deal with a<br />\nbroad range of ambulatory health<br />\nproblems as well as the more<br />\ndifficult aspects of managing<br />\nmore severe, yet stable health<br />\nconcerns.

Dean of<br />\nStudents Robert_ J. Fitzpatrick.<br />\nSaga returns for another year<br />\nlong engagement in the dorm<br />\ncafeteria losing that position two<br />\nyears ago over a price increase,<br />\naccording to Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"The release of Saga at that<br />\ntime, which sacrified quality for<br />\neconomy was a mistake,\"<br />\ncommented Fitzpatrick. \"Out of<br />\nsix companies that submitted<br />\nbids for the Hopkins food service<br />\ncontract this year, Saga was<br />\nunanimously selected by the<br />\nCommittee on Food Service,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick stated.<br />\n\"In order to attain a measure<br />\nof continuity in the food service,<br />\nSaga services the snack bars in<br />\nLevering Hall and the dorms, as<br /><br />\nwell as the dormitory dining<br />\nh al 1 s,\" Fitzpatrick explained.<br />\n\"The University has signed Saga<br />\nto a contract renewable for two<br />\nadditional years,\" he added.<br />\nThomas N. Tanglos, Manager<br />\nfor Saga, revealed that over 50<br />\npercent of all money paid by<br />\nstudents for food goes towards<br />\nthe cost of the food, while 28-30<br />\npercent is for the wages of 40-50<br />\nfull-time employees and a similar<br />\nnumber of part-time workers.<br />\nNeither Tanglos nor Fitzpatrick<br />\nwould venture an estimate of<br />\nSaga's projected profit.<br />\nHowever, Fitzpatrick did<br />\nremark: \"To keep Saga happy, I<br />\nwant Saga to make a profit,<br />\nthough not an excessive one.\"<br />\n\"Saga will meet Hopkins' food<br />\nservice demands,\" promised<br />\nTanglos. \"We serve over 600<br />\nstudents on the dorm meal plans<br />\nand approximately 600 members<br />\nof the Hopkins community in<br />\nLevering Hall each day for lunch.<br /><br />\nfelt that \"the University's action<br />\n(in approving the program) is<br />\nquite unique,\"<br />\n\"I am terribly proud of the<br />\ngroup of students enrolled,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"They are a superb group.\"<br />\nThe program will reportedly<br />\nbe concerned as much with<br />\nstudying what must be done to<br />\nprovide such comprehensive<br />\nservice as with the actual<br />\nempirical training of the Health<br />\nAssociates. The multi-disciplinary<br />\ncurriculum, which will be very<br />\ndemanding, according to<br />\nPeterson, will center around<br />\nthree areas.<br />\nStudents will be trained in<br />\nhuman biology, the social<br />\nsciences and the humanities. \"We<br />\nwill make an effort to take<br />\ncommon health problems as a<br />\nfocus around which these three<br />\ncore disciplines may be evolved,\"<br />\nhe explained. By threading these<br />\nareas together, the Dean<br />\nremarked, the students will have<br />\na greater understanding of the<br />\nproblems faced by their patients,<br />\nand thus, \"since they will not be<br />\njust a technician, they will not be<br />\nobsolete in ten years.\"<br /><br />\nSaga isn't going to pinch pennies<br />\nover food in order to make a<br />\nprofit,\" he added.<br />\nSince Hopkins pays more per<br />\nstudent for food than any other<br />\n;chool in the state. Fitzpatrick<br />\nemphasized the fact that the<br />\nfood must be good or the<br />\nUnivesity will release Saga, as is<br />\nHopkins prerogative under its<br />\nfood contract. Although Saga did<br />\nexperience difficulties servicing<br />\nstudents in the opening week of<br />\nschool, Fitzpatrick is confident<br />\nthat Saga will provide the<br />\nUniversity with its \"best food<br />\nservice ever.\"<br />\nOpinions Varied<br />\nBy taking such measures as<br />\nserving three entrees instead of<br />\nthe contracturally required two<br />\nfor dinner, catering to the needs<br />\nof various clubs and groups for<br />\nrefreshments at a minimal cost,<br />\nand assuming what Fitzpatrick<br />\ncited as a \"very cooperative<br />\nattitude,\" Saga hopes to further<br /><br />\nfulfill the needs of the<br />\nUniversity, Tanglos promised.<br />\nAlthough Fitzpatrick<br />\nexpresssed personal satisfaction<br />\nwith the food, opinions on food<br />\nquality have been quite varied<br />\namong dormitory residents.<br />\n\"Last year, the food was<br />\nlousy,\" said sophomore Bard<br />\nErmentrout. \"This year it's a hell<br />\nof a lot better,\" he added.<br />\n\"Even the ice tasted bad last<br />\nyear,\" \u2022 Robert Lipnick, another<br />\nsophomore, stated. \"This year's<br />\nfood is very inconsistent;<br />\nsometimes it's better, sometimes<br />\nit's worse, Lipnick added.<br />\n\"I like it a lot\" offered<br />\nFreshman Pat Flanner. \"It's<br />\nreally good\" agreed fellow frosh<br />\nAndrea Hasking.<br />\n\"I'm not too crazy about it<br />\nstated freshman Anthony Salvia.<br />\n\"The food is barely edible,\"<br />\nremarked Nancy Wilson, \"But<br />\nthen again,\" she quickly added,<br />\n\"What do you expect?\"<br /><br />\nType II has become a<br />\nsignificantly larger segment<br />\nconsisting of all students,<br />\npart-time faculty and full-time<br />\nemployees on the Homewood<br />\ncampus.<br /><br />\nTypes<br /><br />\nThe reallocation of Type I and<br />\nType II parking spaces marked a<br />\nnet gain for Type II holders,<br />\naccording to the report issued by<br />\nGeorge W.

With many important proposals<br />\nconcerning undergraduate education likely to come before<br />\nthe CUS this year including pass/fail modifications, an<br />\nABC-no credit grading system and part-time study proposals, the Council should be very carefuly to name only the<br />\nmost highly qualified A n d conscientious students available.<br />\nWhile the SC selections committee no doubt considered<br />\nall the candidates very carefully before it made its nominations, the SC should require that the appointees attend all<br />\nCUS meetings and make reports on those meeting to the<br />\nfull Council. Only in this way can undergraduates be sure<br />\nthat the students appointed to represent them on this crucial committee are doing their job.<br />\nThe Council should also make clear to those whom it<br />\nfinally chooses, that their appointments will 'be revoked if<br />\nthey are found not to be doing their job adequately. For<br />\nthe first time in several years there are four undergraduates<br />\non the CUS and, considering the highly important topics up<br />\nfor consideration this year, students should be vigorously<br />\nand responsibly represented there. Requiring that CUS<br />\nmembers account for their actions on the panel will go a<br />\nlong way toward assuring students of that kind of strong<br />\nrepresentation<br /><br />\nSome notes on the passing of the passing scene<br />\nBy B. H. COHEN<br />\n1<br />\nBefore me is a photograph of<br />\nthe President. The President<br />\nappears to be smiling. Or perhaps it<br />\nis gas.

(It<br />\nshould be noted that Mr. Nixon's<br />\n\"Spirit of '76\" entourage includes<br />\none individual whose major<br />\nresponsibility it is to correct the<br />\nPresident's posture, and to be<br />\ncertain he faces the cameramen<br />\nfrom the press at a suitable angle<br />\nwhen waving from the top of the<br />\nplane's portable stairs.)<br />\nI go to this detail to illustrate<br />\none point: The President's visage is<br />\nwell-known, perhaps as well-known<br />\nas Mao's is in China, and any<br />\ncosmetic attempt to reduce it to<br />\nanything resembling less than its<br />\nfull-blown glory is immediately<br />\napparent.
