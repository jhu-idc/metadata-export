In<br />\nthe following year, a grant was made by Charles L<br />\nof England, to Lord Baltimore, of lands covering an<br />\narea even larger than the present limits of the State.<br />\nA permanent settlement was made and government<br />\nestablished at St. Mary\u2019s, on the river and in the<br />\ncounty of the same name, at the head of which col-<br />\nony was Leonard Calvert, the brother of the Propri-<br />\netary. The name of Maryland (Terra Marize) was<br />\ngiven in honor of the queen of the reigning mon-<br />\narch, Charles I. The first settlers were Catholic<br />\nrefugees. The settlers on Kent Island refused alle-<br />\ngiance, and gave some trouble, but were finally<br />\nbrought into subjection to the Proprietary\u2019s govern-<br />\nment. The colony in its younger days underwent<br />\nmany changes, the Proprietary being displaced at<br />\ntimes, and the British government appointing gov-<br />\nernors. In 1691, the British king, who had assumed<br />\ncontrol of the colony, appointed Sir Lionel Copley<br />\ngovernor, and one of the first acts of his government<br />\nwas the removal of the seat of government from<br />\nSt. Mary\u2019s to the town of Providence, from that time<br />\ncalled Annapolis, where it has ever since remained.<br />\nIn this locality was concentrated the Puritan ele-<br />\nment, which had now gained the ascendancy.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1715, the government was again and finally<br />\nrestored to the Proprietary, the principal obstacle to<br />\nthe recognition of the family rights being removed<br />\nby the fact of their having been educated in the faith<br />\nof the establizhed \u201c Church of England.\u201d The pop-<br />\nulation was then about 80,600, and at this time and<br />\nvery many years succeeding, tobacco was almost the<br />\nonly production, and was also used as a currency for<br />\nvarious purposes, and mostly in trade. In 1745, the<br />\nfirst and for a long time the only newspaper in the<br />\ncolony, the \u201c Maryland Gazette,\u201d was published at<br />\nAnnapolis. In 1748, the population was estimated<br />\nat 130,000, of which 94,000 were white, and 36,000<br />\ncolored. In the contest which annihilated the French<br />\ndominion in America, Maryland took an active part.<br />\n<br />\nThe unfortunate expedition of Braddock against<br />\nFort Duquesne was organized in this Province, and<br />\nmarched from Frederick in 1754. In the Revolu-<br />\n<br />\n- tion, Maryland also occupied a leading position, par-<br />\n<br />\nticipating early and strenuously in all the move-<br />\nments of that period. The province expended nearly<br />\n$8,000,000 and furnished over 20,000 men to the<br />\narmies. At the close of the war, Congress met in<br />\nthe State House at Annapolis, and the Senate cham-<br />\nber of that vencrable edifice (which is still un-<br />\nchanged) became inseparably connected with the<br />\nhistory of that epoch, by the resignation therein of<br />\nhis commission as commander-in-chief of the armies,<br />\nby George Washington.<br />\n<br />\nIn the war with Great Britain in 1812 and 1815,<br />\nmany important movements of the British on land<br />\nand water took place in this State. In 1813, the vil-<br />\nlages of Frenchtown, Havre de Grace, Frederick-<br />\ntown, and Georgetown, about the head of the Bay,<br />\nwere plundered and burned by the naval force of<br />\nAdmiral Cockburn, which traversed the Chesapeake.<br />\nThe battle of Bladensburg was fought near the town<br />\nof the same name, and resulted disastrously to the<br />\nAmerican forces. In 1814, the British attempted the<br />\nattack upon Baltimore city, which ended in their<br />\ndefeat at the battle of North Point in Patapsco<br />\n<br />\n\u2018Neck, and they were also completely repulsed in<br />\n<br />\ntheir direct attack on the city by Fort McHenry and<br />\n<br />\nsome small batteries on the suburbs of the town.<br />\nAt the November session of the Assembly in 1835,<br />\n<br />\nan Act was passed amending the Constitution and<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nHISTORY.<br />\n<br />\nform of government of the State. It gave the elec-<br />\ntion of the governor to the people, instead of to two<br />\nel\u00e9ctors from each county as heretofore; abolished<br />\nthe Council to the Governor; gave one senator to<br />\neach county and one to the city of Baltimore, and<br />\nchanged the apportionment of delegates, giving five<br />\nto Baltimore and to each of two of the counties, four<br />\nto each of cight of the counties, three to cach of the<br />\nremaining counties, and one to Annapolis.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1851 a State Convention assembled for the pur-<br />\npose of revising the Constitution. The principal<br />\nchanges were: conforming the representations of<br />\nthe counlies more to the population,\u2014 giving Balti-<br />\nmore city ten; to Anmapolis, none; to two of the<br />\ncounties, six; to one, five; to two, four; to six,<br />\nthree; and to the remaining ones, two each; making<br />\nthe judiciary elective by the people, and making the<br />\nsessions of the legislature biennial.<br />\n<br />\nGovernor Lowe was succeeded in 1854 by T. Wat-<br />\nkins Ligon, Esq., of Howard County. IIe was suc-<br />\nceeded, in 1857, by Thomas Holliday Iicks, Esq.,<br />\nof Dorchester County. During Governor Iicks\u2019s<br />\nterm of office, the Southern States seceded from the<br />\nUnion.<br />\n<br />\nThe civil war virtually commenced on the 4th of<br />\nMarch, 1861, when Gen. P. T. Beauregard took for-<br />\nmal command of the Confederate forces in Charles-<br />\nton, and commenced operations for besieging Fort<br />\nSumter, which surrendered on the 13th of April fol-<br />\nlowing. Although Maryland did not secede from the<br />\nUnion, some of the opening and most important<br />\nevents of the war transpired in the State, the first<br />\nblood being shed in the streets of Baltimore on the<br />\n19th of April, when a Massachusetts regiment pass-<br />\ning through to Washington was attacked by a mob,<br />\nand two Kkilled and eight wounded.<br />\n<br />\nFor some months after, the principal seat of war<br />\nbeing near Washington and on the Potomac border,<br />\nthe proximity of large bodies of troops, and the con-<br />\nstant liability that the State would become the the-<br />\natre of active hostilities, had a tendency to demoral-<br />\nize all industries and keep the community in a state<br />\nof excitement and alarm, which subsequent events<br />\nfully justified, as Maryland was, during the war,<br />\nthree times invaded by the Confederate forces.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1862, Gen. Lee passed northward through Vir-<br />\nginia, forded the Potomac near the Point of Rocks<br />\non the 8d of Sept., and on the morning of Sept.<br />\n6th, the advance-guard, 3,000 strong, under \u00a2 Stone-<br />\nwall\u201d Jackson, entered without opposition the city<br />\nof Frederick. On the 8th, Gen. Lee issued a pro-<br />\nclamation to the people of Maryland, urging them<br />\nto secede from the Union, and assuring them of the<br />\ncovperation of his army to aid them in severing<br />\ntheir connection with it. No general response was<br />\nmade to the appeal. :<br />\n<br />\nAt the same time, Governor Augustus W. Brad-<br />\nford, who succeeded Governor Hicks in December,<br />\n1861, issued a proclamation calling upon the citizens<br />\nto form suitable organizations to render effectual<br />\naid to the National Government. On the 10th, the<br />\nadvance of Gen. Lee\u2019s army entered Ilagerstown,<br />\nhaving evacuated Frederick the same day, the latter<br />\nplace being reached by the Union army under Gen.<br />\nMcClellan on the 12th.<br />\n<br />\nGen. Lee having dispatched a portion of his army<br />\nunder the command of Gen. Jackson, for the attack<br />\non Harper\u2019s Ferry, took up a strong position with the<br />\nremainder about twelve miles west of Frederick,<br />\nwhere, on the 14th, was fought the battle of South<br />\nMountain, which was opened by an attack from the<br />\nright wing of the Union army under Gen. Hooker,<br />\nand, after a sharply contested engagement which<br />\nlasted throughout the day, the Confederate forces re-<br />\ntreated in the direction of the Potomac, and concen-<br />\ntrated at Sharpsburg, near Antietam Creek, where<br />\nthey were rejoined by Gen. Jackson, who had, on the<br />\n15th, captured Harper\u2019s Ferry with 11,000 prisoners.<br />\n<br />\nHere, at daylight on the 17th of September, com-<br />\nmenced the battle of \u00a2 Antietam,\u201d one of the most<br />\ndestructive engagements of the war, nearly 30,000<br />\n<br />\n <br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nmen being killed or wounded. About 200,000<br />\nmen were engaged, with 500 pieces of artillery, the<br />\nfight continuing until the combatants were separated<br />\nby the darkness of the night. The tide of battle<br />\nswayed with varying results during the day, nearly<br />\nall the ground upon which it was fought being taken<br />\nand retaken in turn. Both armies slept upon the<br />\nfield, expecting to renew the fight on the morning<br />\nof the 18th. The Confederate army, however, re-<br />\ntired from their position, and crossed the Potomac<br />\ninto Virginia, abandoning every place they had occu-<br />\npied north of the river, including Harper\u2019s Ferry.<br />\n<br />\nOn the 10th and 11th of October following, Gen.<br />\nJ. E. B. Stewart, with a force of 2,000 Confederate<br />\ncavalry, made a daring raid across the State, reach-<br />\ning Chambersburg, P\u2019a., where he burnt all the<br />\nGovernment property, supplied himself with fresh<br />\nhorses, and, after capturing a large amount of stores<br />\nand supplies, passed rapidly around the Union army<br />\nin Maryland, and crossed the Potomac into Virginia.<br />\n<br />\nOn the 14th of June, 1863, Gen. Lee again crossed<br />\nthe Potomac and advanced upon Hagerstown, ex-<br />\ntending his army through the border counties of<br />\nMaryland and Pennsylvania to Chambersburg, Car-<br />\nlisle, etc. The armies finally concentrated near<br />\nGettysburg, a small town in Adams County, Pa.,<br />\n114 miles west of Philadelphia, and 75 north of<br />\n\u2018Washington.<br />\n<br />\nHere, on the 1st, 2d, and 3d of July, was fought a<br />\ngreat battle between the entire army of Gen. Lee, and<br />\nthe army of the Potomac under Gen. Meade, which<br />\nresulted in the defeat of the Confederate forces, and<br />\na joint loss of about 48,000 men, killed or wounded.<br />\n<br />\nIn July, 1864, Gen. Early, with a force of 22,000<br />\nmen, crossed the Potomac into Maryland, above<br />\nHarper\u2019s Ferry, marched upon Hagerstown, and<br />\ntook possession of that place. To save the city of<br />\nFrederick from burning, the sum of two hundred<br />\nthousand dollars was paid to General Early; and<br />\nnearly one hundred thousand dollars was paid to<br />\nMcCausland, in money and goods, by the citizens of<br />\nHagerstown.<br />\n<br />\nPassing on towards Baltimore, he was met on the<br />\n9th of July by Gen. Lewis Wallace, at Monocacy,<br />\nwhere a severe engagement was had without check-<br />\ning his advance, and the next day he took possession<br />\nof Fredericktown. For four days his army was en-<br />\ngaged in plundering the people of Maryland, passing<br />\nat one time to within six miles of Washington, cutting<br />\nthe railroad and telegraphic communication with the<br />\nNorth, and threatening the Capital itself. On the 13th<br />\nhe recrossed the Potomac with an immense amount<br />\nof booty, and made his way back to Richmond.<br />\n<br />\nIn April, 1864, a convention was held for a further<br />\nrevision of the State Constitution. By this conven-<br />\ntion a registration of voters was provided for; the<br />\nprinciple of representation according to population<br />\nwas adopted; to Baltimore City were given three<br />\nsenators and eighteen representatives; to each county<br />\none senator; to two counties six representatives; to<br />\ntwo, five; to two, four; to two, three; to two, eight;<br />\nand to four, one; the power of appointing magis-<br />\ntrates was restored to the Governor; and a State<br />\nBoard of Education was created, consisting of the<br />\nGovernor, the Lieutenant-Governor, the Speaker of<br />\nthe Iouse of Delegates, and the State Superinten-<br />\ndent of Education.<br />\n<br />\nBesides these changes, it was declared \u2014 Article<br />\n24th, Declaration of Rights\u2014\u00a2that hereafter, in this<br />\nState, there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary<br />\ngervitude, except in punishment of crime whereof<br />\nthe party shall have been duly convicted; and all<br />\npersons held to service or labor as slaves are hereby<br />\ndeclared free.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSince the close of the Civil War, the advance of<br />\nMaryland in all material interests has been rapid.<br />\nAn entire change in the system of labor, and the<br />\nestablishment of free schools, have largely increased<br />\nimmigration, and done much toward the develop-<br />\nment of the agricultural and other industrial interests<br />\nof the State,<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "\u2014<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\ni<br /><br /><br /><br />\nHISTORY.<br /><br />\n\u2014\u20140-0p 00\u2014<br /><br />\nTHE State of Maryland was one of the British<br /><br />\ncolonies, and original thirteen States of the<br />\nAmerican Union, and occupies the most central po-<br />\nsition on the seaboard, nearly surrounding the Na-<br />\ntional Capital.<br /><br />\nThe first settlement in Maryland was made in 1631<br />\nupon Kent Island, by William Claiborne and some<br />\nfollowers, who took possession of that region.
