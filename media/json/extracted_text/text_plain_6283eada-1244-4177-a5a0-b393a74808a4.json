No. 9<br />\nFIRST \"PLAY NIGHT\" OF<br />\nDRAMATIC CLUB WELL<br />\nATTENDED.<br />\nTwo Playlets Presented Successfully.<br />\nUndergraduate Orchestra Adds to<br />\nThe Evening's Enjoyment.<br />\n<br />\nThe first \"play night\" of the<br />\nDramatic Club held last Tuesday<br />\nnight in the club's studio in the<br />\n\"Barn\" was more of a success than<br />\never anticipated. The \"theater\"<br />\nwas crowded to its seating capacity and at 8.20 o'clock it was found<br />\nnecessary to erect a \"standing<br />\nroom only\" sign. The audience<br />\nwas composed largely of persons<br />\nunconnected with the University,<br />\nall of whom were very enthusiastic<br />\nover the plays. The student-body<br />\nwas poorly represented.<br />\nThe first playlet was a fantasy<br />\nby E. M. Basford entitled \"Three<br />\nFriends\" and was followed by<br />\nJoseph Moran's \"Triangle Extraordinary.\" For a long time it was<br />\nthought better to have the fantasy<br />\ncome after the melodrama so as to<br />\nleave a pleasant scene in the minds<br />\nof the audience, but it was found<br />\nthat to put up the trees and their<br />\nbranches would require much more<br />\ntime than to take them down.<br />\nThe, casts of the plays were as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Three Friends\"\u2014The Boy, Joe<br />\nMoran, '23;<br />\np23;the Mother E. F.<br />\nSpirit of Night,<br />\nBuchner,<br />\nGlover Fallon, '23; Soul of the<br />\nTrees, Frank R. Smith, '21; Soul<br />\nof thern BroOk, C.

The \"Spirits,\"<br />\nthough on for only a short time,<br />\ngave very creditable interpretations of their roles, which were<br />\nrather difficult for men. Buchner<br />\nas the \"Mother\" was very impressive.<br />\nThe second play, a,clever sketch<br />\nby Moran, was, perhaps if there<br />\nwas any, difference, the'<br />\nbetter of<br />\nthe two from the student's point<br />\nof view. The acting was not at all<br />\nPerfect, but was saved by the<br />\nrather clever lines inserted by the<br />\nauthor. Pearce Brawner as Lester<br />\nplayed the part very well, but was<br />\nmost affected. Jenifer whose part<br />\nwas that of a mah whose<br />\n' identity<br />\nis unknown, but who is taken -for<br />\nGeorge Graham, was the most<br />\nnatural of them all, even though<br />\nhe did not have more than ten<br />\nlines to say.<br />\n3/Iessersmith made- a very effective heroine and Sadtler a very<br />\ngood butler.<br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 4)<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 30, 1920<br />\n<br />\nBLACK AND BLUE LOSE STATE<br />\nCHAMPIONSHIP<br />\n<br />\nPRICE 10 CENTS<br />\nGRADUATION HURTS BALL<br />\nTEAM.<br />\nOnly Six Regulars Return\u2014Management Arranging Good Schedule.<br />\nArmstrong Continues as Coach.<br />\n<br />\nMaryland State Defeats Hopkins Eleven in Deciding<br />\nStruggle on Homewood Field by<br />\nScore of 24-7.<br />\n<br />\nIn one of the greatest battles ever seen on Homefield Field, the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland won the State football championship on<br />\nThanksgiving Day by defeating Hopkins, 24 to 7.<br />\nThe game was in every sense a fitting climax to the fall season, for<br />\nboth teams had won all their contests with Maryland elevens, and both<br />\nwere at the very peak of their development and power. Stands packed<br />\nto capacity with supporters of the two squads looked down on the field<br />\nand shouted encouragement, while the music of the rival bands and a<br />\nbrisk wind set the spectators on edge for a close fight.<br />\nThe bare score gives little indication of how hotly contested the<br />\ngame was. Both Hopkins and Maryland had what were perhaps the<br />\nmost powerful elevens ever to represent the two institutions. Few<br />\ngains of consequence were made on straight football, but each score<br />\nfollowed something in the nature of a break, and most of the breaks<br />\nwere in the College Parker's favor. The contest might well be called<br />\na game of \"almost\" touchdowns for Hopkins, for once in the second<br />\nquarter a clever fake kick came dangerously near putting the ball over,<br />\nwhile the end of the game found the Black and Blue with a scant yard<br />\nto go and a score almost a certainty.<br />\nThe work of Bill and Ed Wood<br />\non the ends was one of the greatest factors in keeping the score<br />\ndown. Not once did Brewer or<br />\nthe other State bhcks get away for<br />\na respectable run after a punt, and<br />\nfew, indeed, were the end runs<br />\nthat gained more than a yard or<br />\nso. In addition, Ed recovered a<br />\nfumble and ran 40 yards before being pulled down.<br />\nMorgan and Totterdale also<br />\nstood out prominently, for it was<br />\n\"Til\" who broke through and recovered the ball on Maryland's 10yard line, making possible Hop.<br />\nkins' touchdown, while Totterdale,<br />\nplaying a roving center, was a<br />\ntower of strength on the defense.<br />\nIt is a matter of fact that the<br />\nwhole line exhibited a style of<br />\nfootball that could hardly be improved on.<br />\nThe almost air-tight defensive<br />\nwork of both elevens kept the backfields from getting away for frequent gains of\u2022 any. length. All<br />\nthe Hopkins backs made clever<br />\nruns at'times against the bitterest<br />\nof opposition, while Jones came<br />\n<br />\nthrough with a brilliant dash of 30<br />\nyards from a kickoff. Brewer was<br />\nthe real star for State on the offensive; his run of 50 yards was<br />\nthe longest of the game, and his<br />\npunts probably the best ever seen<br />\nin Baltimore. Mackert failed to<br />\nlive up to what was expected of<br />\nhim, although he played an excellent and a consistent game.<br />\nMaryland's first score came during the first quarter. After some<br />\nminutes of play, in which the.opposing teams tested each other for<br />\npossible weak spots, one of Brewer's punts struck Jones on the head<br />\nand was recovered by State. On<br />\nthe next play Mackert fumbled,<br />\nGregg recovering, but another<br />\nfumble by Markell gave the ball<br />\nback to Maryland. Here a series<br />\nof line plunges and a pass over<br />\nthe goal line gave the College<br />\nParkers a touchdown.<br />\nState scored again in the second<br />\nquarter, after a 15-yard penalty<br />\nand a 12-yard run by Brewer had<br />\ncarried the ball to Within 5 yards<br />\nof the goal.<br />\nMackert then<br />\n(Continued on page 4, co1.1)<br />\n<br />\nThe 1921 baseball management<br />\nhas already succeeded in arranging the skeleton of a very good<br />\nschedule for the coming season.<br />\nBy this Hopkins will meet some<br />\nof the leading teams of the country\u2014among them Princeton', Penn<br />\nState, University of Virginia,<br />\nSwarthmore and Wesleyan.

An opportunity was then extended to<br />\nevery member of Seabbard and<br />\nBlade to make suggestions for improving the unit and correcting<br />\ndifficulties which had been encountered. The organization of a rifle<br />\nclub to represent Hopkins in intercollegiate shooting matches was<br />\ndiscussed and the subject referred<br />\nto a committee of four for investigation and report.<br />\nThe Scabbard and Blade is a<br />\nnational honorary military society, comprising at present two<br />\nregiments with a total of 22 companies, each company-chapter at a<br />\ncollege or university conferring<br />\nbaccalaureate degrees, and maintaining a senior R. 0.

The society believes that<br />\nmilitary service is an obligation of<br />\ncitizenship, and that the greater<br />\nopportunities afforded college men<br />\nfor the study of military science<br />\nplace upon them certain responsibilities as citizens. Its purpose is<br />\nto unite in closer relationship the<br />\nmilitary departments of American<br />\nuniversities; to_ preserve and develop the essential qualities of<br />\ngood and efficient officers; to prepare its members as educated men<br />\nto take a more active part and to<br />\nhave a greater influence in the<br />\nmilitary affairs of the communities in which they may reside, and<br />\nabove all to spread intelligent information concerning the military<br />\nrequirements of our country.<br />\nThis company of the Scabbard<br />\nand Blade was formed in the<br />\nspring a last year. Fred Bresee,<br />\n420, was chosen captain. The officers for this year were elected just<br />\nbefore the close of school last year,<br />\nas follows: Cadet Major C. F.<br />\nChisholm, Captain; Capt. T.\u2022 F.<br />\nHubbard, First Lieutenant; Capt.<br />\nB. F. Sollers, Second Lieutenant,<br />\nand Capt. T. L. Berry, First Sergeant.

The \"theater\"<br />\nwas crowded to its seating capacity and at 8.20 o'clock it was found<br />\nnecessary to erect a \"standing<br />\nroom only\" sign. The audience<br />\nwas composed largely of persons<br />\nunconnected with the University,<br />\nall of whom were very enthusiastic<br />\nover the plays. The student-body<br />\nwas poorly represented.<br />\nThe first playlet was a fantasy<br />\nby E. M. Basford entitled \"Three<br />\nFriends\" and was followed by<br />\nJoseph Moran's \"Triangle Extraordinary.\" For a long time it was<br />\nthought better to have the fantasy<br />\ncome after the melodrama so as to<br />\nleave a pleasant scene in the minds<br />\nof the audience, but it was found<br />\nthat to put up the trees and their<br />\nbranches would require much more<br />\ntime than to take them down.<br />\nThe, casts of the plays were as<br />\nfollows:<br />\n\"Three Friends\"\u2014The Boy, Joe<br />\nMoran, '23;<br />\np23;the Mother E. F.<br />\nSpirit of Night,<br />\nBuchner,<br />\nGlover Fallon, '23; Soul of the<br />\nTrees, Frank R. Smith, '21; Soul<br />\nof thern BroOk, C.

The \"Spirits,\"<br />\nthough on for only a short time,<br />\ngave very creditable interpretations of their roles, which were<br />\nrather difficult for men. Buchner<br />\nas the \"Mother\" was very impressive.<br />\nThe second play, a,clever sketch<br />\nby Moran, was, perhaps if there<br />\nwas any, difference, the'<br />\nbetter of<br />\nthe two from the student's point<br />\nof view. The acting was not at all<br />\nPerfect, but was saved by the<br />\nrather clever lines inserted by the<br />\nauthor.

Jenifer whose part<br />\nwas that of a mah whose<br />\n' identity<br />\nis unknown, but who is taken -for<br />\nGeorge Graham, was the most<br />\nnatural of them all, even though<br />\nhe did not have more than ten<br />\nlines to say.<br />\n3/Iessersmith made- a very effective heroine and Sadtler a very<br />\ngood butler.<br />\n(Continued on page 3, col. 4)<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., NOVEMBER 30, 1920<br /><br />\nBLACK AND BLUE LOSE STATE<br />\nCHAMPIONSHIP<br /><br />\nPRICE 10 CENTS<br />\nGRADUATION HURTS BALL<br />\nTEAM.<br />\nOnly Six Regulars Return\u2014Management Arranging Good Schedule.<br />\nArmstrong Continues as Coach.<br /><br />\nMaryland State Defeats Hopkins Eleven in Deciding<br />\nStruggle on Homewood Field by<br />\nScore of 24-7.<br /><br />\nIn one of the greatest battles ever seen on Homefield Field, the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland won the State football championship on<br />\nThanksgiving Day by defeating Hopkins, 24 to 7.<br />\nThe game was in every sense a fitting climax to the fall season, for<br />\nboth teams had won all their contests with Maryland elevens, and both<br />\nwere at the very peak of their development and power. Stands packed<br />\nto capacity with supporters of the two squads looked down on the field<br />\nand shouted encouragement, while the music of the rival bands and a<br />\nbrisk wind set the spectators on edge for a close fight.<br />\nThe bare score gives little indication of how hotly contested the<br />\ngame was. Both Hopkins and Maryland had what were perhaps the<br />\nmost powerful elevens ever to represent the two institutions. Few<br />\ngains of consequence were made on straight football, but each score<br />\nfollowed something in the nature of a break, and most of the breaks<br />\nwere in the College Parker's favor. The contest might well be called<br />\na game of \"almost\" touchdowns for Hopkins, for once in the second<br />\nquarter a clever fake kick came dangerously near putting the ball over,<br />\nwhile the end of the game found the Black and Blue with a scant yard<br />\nto go and a score almost a certainty.<br />\nThe work of Bill and Ed Wood<br />\non the ends was one of the greatest factors in keeping the score<br />\ndown. Not once did Brewer or<br />\nthe other State bhcks get away for<br />\na respectable run after a punt, and<br />\nfew, indeed, were the end runs<br />\nthat gained more than a yard or<br />\nso. In addition, Ed recovered a<br />\nfumble and ran 40 yards before being pulled down.<br />\nMorgan and Totterdale also<br />\nstood out prominently, for it was<br />\n\"Til\" who broke through and recovered the ball on Maryland's 10yard line, making possible Hop.<br />\nkins' touchdown, while Totterdale,<br />\nplaying a roving center, was a<br />\ntower of strength on the defense.<br />\nIt is a matter of fact that the<br />\nwhole line exhibited a style of<br />\nfootball that could hardly be improved on.<br />\nThe almost air-tight defensive<br />\nwork of both elevens kept the backfields from getting away for frequent gains of\u2022 any. length. All<br />\nthe Hopkins backs made clever<br />\nruns at'times against the bitterest<br />\nof opposition, while Jones came<br /><br />\nthrough with a brilliant dash of 30<br />\nyards from a kickoff. Brewer was<br />\nthe real star for State on the offensive; his run of 50 yards was<br />\nthe longest of the game, and his<br />\npunts probably the best ever seen<br />\nin Baltimore. Mackert failed to<br />\nlive up to what was expected of<br />\nhim, although he played an excellent and a consistent game.<br />\nMaryland's first score came during the first quarter. After some<br />\nminutes of play, in which the.opposing teams tested each other for<br />\npossible weak spots, one of Brewer's punts struck Jones on the head<br />\nand was recovered by State. On<br />\nthe next play Mackert fumbled,<br />\nGregg recovering, but another<br />\nfumble by Markell gave the ball<br />\nback to Maryland. Here a series<br />\nof line plunges and a pass over<br />\nthe goal line gave the College<br />\nParkers a touchdown.<br />\nState scored again in the second<br />\nquarter, after a 15-yard penalty<br />\nand a 12-yard run by Brewer had<br />\ncarried the ball to Within 5 yards<br />\nof the goal.<br />\nMackert then<br />\n(Continued on page 4, co1.1)<br /><br />\nThe 1921 baseball management<br />\nhas already succeeded in arranging the skeleton of a very good<br />\nschedule for the coming season.<br />\nBy this Hopkins will meet some<br />\nof the leading teams of the country\u2014among them Princeton', Penn<br />\nState, University of Virginia,<br />\nSwarthmore and Wesleyan.

An opportunity was then extended to<br />\nevery member of Seabbard and<br />\nBlade to make suggestions for improving the unit and correcting<br />\ndifficulties which had been encountered.

The society believes that<br />\nmilitary service is an obligation of<br />\ncitizenship, and that the greater<br />\nopportunities afforded college men<br />\nfor the study of military science<br />\nplace upon them certain responsibilities as citizens. Its purpose is<br />\nto unite in closer relationship the<br />\nmilitary departments of American<br />\nuniversities; to_ preserve and develop the essential qualities of<br />\ngood and efficient officers; to prepare its members as educated men<br />\nto take a more active part and to<br />\nhave a greater influence in the<br />\nmilitary affairs of the communities in which they may reside, and<br />\nabove all to spread intelligent information concerning the military<br />\nrequirements of our country.<br />\nThis company of the Scabbard<br />\nand Blade was formed in the<br />\nspring a last year. Fred Bresee,<br />\n420, was chosen captain. The officers for this year were elected just<br />\nbefore the close of school last year,<br />\nas follows: Cadet Major C.
