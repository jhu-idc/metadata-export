In<br />\n1829 he went to Liverpool where<br />\nhe attended the Royal Institute.<br />\nHe only remained there for two<br />\nyears, but during this time established his reputation as a brilliant<br />\nmathematician.<br />\nIn 1831, when just over seven<br />\nteen, he entered St. John's College,<br />\nCambridge. He continued here<br />\nuntil the beginning of 1834, when<br />\nsickness compelled him to leave<br />\nIns work for a time. He re-entered<br />\ncollege in 1836 and took in final<br />\nexaminations in 1837,being placed<br />\nsecond on the list.<br />\nIn 1838 Sylvester was elected<br />\nto the professorship of natural<br />\nphilosophy at (what is now) University College, London. While<br />\nhere he also *as elected a Fellow<br />\nof the Royal Society and began to<br />\npublish articles on his chosen subject.<br />\nAfter three years he left the<br />\nOld World and took the, position<br />\nof professor of mathematics at tic'<br />\nUniversity of Virginia. His e-;perience here was disheartening,<br />\nand almost caused him to give 11,)<br />\nmathematics. He was not understood, and his brilliant mind wAs<br />\nnot given proper opportunities for<br />\ndevelopment. In addition, lie be<br />\ncame involved in slavery disputes<br />\nwith some of his students, and the<br />\nunpleasant feeling that developed<br />\nmade his life almost unbearable.<br />\nThe outcome was his immediate<br />\nreturn to England where he took<br />\na position as actuary with a life<br />\nassurance company. He remained<br />\nat this post for ten years before<br />\nagain returning to the teaching of<br />\nmathematics. In 1855 he was ap<br />\npointed professor of mathmalics<br />\nat the Royal Military Academy.<br />\nWoolwich, which position he held<br />\nfor fifteen years.<br />\nIn 1875 he was chosen to head<br />\nthe department of mathematics in<br />\nthe newly founded Johns Honkinq<br />\n1Thiversity. He remained at Ho-)kins until 1883. when. w*th<br />\npraise and gratitude or his colleagues in America rilwing, in his<br />\nears, he recrossed the Atlantic to<br />\nbecome Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford.<br />\n<br />\n\"You can not have a great university without such great<br />\nmen as Sylvester in your corps of teachers,\" wrote Prof. Benjamin Pierce to President Gilman, before the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity had been formally launched. \"I hope you will find<br />\nit in your heart to place him where he belongs, and the time<br />\nwill come when all the world will applaud the wisdom of your<br />\nselection.\"<br />\nPresident Gilman did find it in his heart to follow the advice\u2014<br />\nand Professor Pierce's prophecy has been fulfilled. The name<br />\nof Sylvester today is among the greatest of all the great names<br />\nwhich have adorned Hopkins' history. Coming to Baltimore a<br />\nstranger at the age of sixty-three, Sylvester, nevertheless, supported the ideals of the new university with a vigor and an enthusiasm unsurpassed by the youngest of his associates.<br />\nIt is not in the work he did, however, that Sylvester is alone<br />\ninteresting. The peculiarities of the man\u2014his marvelous erudition and sympathy with all branches of intellectual achievement, his keen interest in all things esthetic, the brilliancy of<br />\nhis attack upon the outworn narrowness of the English universities to which Hopkins was setting a new example, all give to<br />\nhis character a peculiar vividness. He brought to the University a touch of the Old World atmosphere; he personified the<br />\ncombination of venerable traditions with ever-youthful energy.<br />\n<br />\nSylvester, in the latter part of<br />\nIn March, 1897, while still actively working upon his beloved his life, made several experiments<br />\nmathematics, he had a paralytic in writing verse, among his .conseizure from which he never re- tributions being \"Rosalind\" and<br />\n\"Spring's Debut, a Town Idyll.\"<br />\ncovered.<br />\n<br />\nJAMES JOSEPH SYLVESTER<br />\nBy courtesy of The Alumni Magazine<br />\n<br />\nWORK HAD WORLD INFLUENCE<br />\nMade Hopkins a Center of Mathematical<br />\nResearch\u2014Inspired Pupils With His<br />\nZeal - First Editor of American<br />\nJournal of Mathematics.<br />\n<br />\nWhen the Johns Hopkins University was founded at Baltimore<br />\nin 1875, James Sylvester was<br />\nchosen as the first professor of<br />\nmathematics. He was given freerein and allowed to conduct his<br />\ndepartment as he saw fit. He<br />\nhad taught for a year at the University of Virginia, but he had<br />\nnot been appreciated there, and<br />\nafter his distasteful experience<br />\nand hasty return to England from<br />\nVirginia, he ventured again to the<br />\nNew World with pronounced<br />\nmisgivings. At Hopkins, however,<br />\nlie was allowed the perfect free(:0111 needed to bring out the full<br />\nforce of his character and ability.<br />\nAll during his stay at Hopkins,<br />\nSylvester emphasized what he believed to be the ideal method of<br />\nteaching \u2014 the combination instruction and research. It was<br />\nwhile teaching one of his pupils<br />\nthe \"New Algebra\" that Sylvester<br />\nhad an inspiration which eventually led to his discovery of the<br />\nproof of ,principles whose solution he had given up as hopeless.<br />\nWhen the American Journal a<br />\nMathematics was established at<br />\nthe University in 1878, it was put<br />\nunder the direction of Professor<br />\nSylvester. The first article he<br />\npublished in the Journal was an<br />\naccount of the application of the<br />\nnew atomic theory to the graphical representation of the concomitants of binary quantities.<br />\nDuring his stay at Hopkins,<br />\nFylvester, besides accomplishing a<br />\nvast amount of mathematical research work, was an inspiring<br />\nteacher. His ardor for his subject never waned. In the classroom his enthusiasm would invariably kindle, and he would lose<br />\nhimself in his work; his mind, although he was almost seventy,<br />\never active, ever searching for<br />\nnew principles. At times, in the<br />\ncourse of a lecture, he would suddenly see some new problem, leave<br />\nthe subject he happened to be<br />\nteaching, and work away on the<br />\nnew train of inquiry until the problem was solved. By carrying on his<br />\ninvestigations and researches before his class, he instilled into the<br />\nstudents a desire to do such work<br />\nfor themselves, besides showing<br />\nthem the methods pursued by the<br />\nskilled investigator.<br />\nWhen Professor Sylvester decided to leave the new University<br />\nthat Ile had assisted so much, the<br />\npresident called a farewell meeting in his honor on December 20,<br />\n1883, at which meeting the follow(Continued on page 6, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n\f'1'HE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, APRIL 23, 1917.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nAddress Commemorative of Sylvester I<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nBy. FABIAN FRANKLIN, Ph. D.<br />\n[Delivered at a Memorial Meeting at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, May 2, 1897.1<br />\n* * * Of his work as a teacher,<br />\nI can speak only upon the basis<br />\nof his activity in this University.<br />\nThe one thing which constantly<br />\nmarked his lectures was enthusiastic love of the thing he was do<br />\ning. He had in the fullest possible degree, to use the Ftench<br />\nphrase, the defect of this quality;<br />\nfor as he almost always spoke<br />\nwith -enthusiastic ardor, so it was<br />\nalmost never possible for him to<br />\nspeak on \u2022 matters incapable of<br />\nevoking his ardor. In other<br />\nwords, the substance of his lectures had to consist largely \u2022of<br />\nhis own work, and, as a rule, of<br />\nwork hot from the forge. The<br />\nconsequence was that a continuous and systematic presentation<br />\nof any extensive body of doctrine<br />\nalready completed was not to be<br />\nexpected from him. Any unsolved<br />\ndifficulty; any suggested extension, such as would have been<br />\npassed by with a mention by other<br />\nlecturers, became with him inevitably the occasion of a digression<br />\nwhich was sure to consume many<br />\nweeks, if, indeed, it did not take<br />\nhim away from the original subject permanently. Nearly all of<br />\nthe important memoirs which he<br />\npublished while in Baltimore<br />\narose in this way. We who attended his lectures may be said to<br />\nhave seen these memoirs in the<br />\nmaking. He would give us on the<br />\nFriday the outcome of his grapplings with the enemy since the<br />\nTuesday lecture. Rarely can it<br />\nhave fallen to the lot of any<br />\nclass to follow so completely the<br />\nworkings of the mind of the master.<br />\nAs is well known, Sylvester had<br />\nan extraordinary faculty for the<br />\ncoinage of words, which, indeed,<br />\nwas merely a part of remarkable<br />\nkeen sense for language in gen<br />\neral. In this matter of the coinage of words, he doubtless went<br />\nto extremes, as he did in other<br />\nthings; but there can be no question of the great service he rendered to the new science of invariants by the creation of a whole<br />\nnew vocabulary which rendere.1<br />\npossible the crystallization of<br />\nthought in what would otherwise<br />\nhave been a comparatively amoropitons mass. There are doubtless<br />\nother departments of mathematics<br />\nwhich would have been more manageable by the skillful application<br />\nof just such a naine-creating faculty. Any mathematical conception with which Sylvester had<br />\nmuch to do had to be equipped<br />\nwish a name. He justly felt that<br />\nthe absence of it impeded thought,<br />\nand he could not be comfortable<br />\niii this state of things. His hearers will not forget how, after getting along for some time with the<br />\nnotation ( ), by which mathebeen content,<br />\nmaticans had<br />\n<br />\nOne of our great English judges observed on some occasion,<br />\nwhen he was outvoted by his brethren on the bench (or, perchance, it may have been the twelfth outstanding juryman, who<br />\nprotested that never before in his life had he been shut up with<br />\neleven other such obstinate men) that \"opinions ought to count<br />\nby weight rather than by number,\" and so I would say that the<br />\ngood done by a university is to be estimated not so much by the<br />\nmere'number of its members as by the spirit which actuates and<br />\nthe work that is done by them. When I hear, as I have heard,<br />\nof members of this University, only hoping to be enabled to keep<br />\nbody and soul together in order that they may continue to enjoy<br />\nthe advantages which it affords, it may be for a decade of years<br />\nto come; when I find classes diligently attending lectures on the<br />\nmost obstruse branches of scholarship and science, remote from<br />\nall the avenues which lead to fortune or public recognition; when<br />\nI observe the earnestness with which our younger members adof<br />\ndress themselves to the study of the place, and the absence<br />\ny<br />\nnecessit<br />\nthe<br />\nwithout<br />\nall manifestations of disorder or levity,<br />\nthat<br />\nme<br />\nto<br />\nit<br />\nseems<br />\n,<br />\nrestraint<br />\nexternal<br />\nany<br />\nof<br />\nfor the exercise<br />\nthis establishment, even in its cradle, better responds to what<br />\na<br />\nits name should import, more fully embodies the true idea of<br />\nhunwith<br />\nswarmed<br />\nrooms<br />\nlectureand<br />\nhalls<br />\nits<br />\nif<br />\nthan<br />\nty,<br />\nuniversi<br />\ndreds of idle and indifferent students,. or with students, diligent,<br />\neven<br />\nindeed, but working not from a pure love of knowledge, not<br />\nplaces<br />\nhigh<br />\nfor<br />\nbut<br />\ncrown,<br />\nfor the chaplet of olive, or the laurel<br />\nin examinations, for marks, as we say in England, the counters<br />\nlarge<br />\nor vouchers to enable their fortunate possessor to draw<br />\ncivil<br />\ne<br />\nlucrativ<br />\nor<br />\nip<br />\nfellowsh<br />\nsinecure<br />\nstakes out of the pool of<br />\non<br />\nr<br />\nSylveste<br />\nProf.<br />\nby<br />\nd<br />\ndelivere<br />\naddress<br />\nFrpm<br />\nments.\u2014<br />\nappoint<br />\n1877.<br />\n22,<br />\nCommemoration Day, February,<br />\nfrom the time of Legendre, to<br />\ndesignate the number of numbers<br />\nless than a given number and<br />\nprime to it, he came into the lecture-room one afternoon and began, in his most emphatic manner, thus:\"Gentlemen, I am about<br />\nto introduce to you a name that<br />\nhas been struggling for birth for<br />\na century!\"<br />\nAmerican names are no longer<br />\nabsent of the heroes of mathematics; but there are now among us<br />\na dozen universities in each of<br />\nwhich something, be it much or<br />\nlittle, is being added to that splendid monument of human thought<br />\nwhich bears the record of conquests made by so many of the<br />\nintellectual giants of the race.<br />\nAmong these giants, Sylvester has<br />\nwithout a question the right to be<br />\nreckoned. In the history of<br />\nmathematics, his place will t!ot be<br />\nwith the very greatest; but his<br />\nwork, brilliant and memorable- as<br />\nit was, affords no trpe measure of<br />\nhis intellectual greatness. Those<br />\nwho came within the sphere of<br />\nhis personality could not but feel<br />\nthat, through the force of circumstances, combined with the peculiarities of his poetic temperament, his performances, splendid<br />\nas it was, had not adequately reflected his magnificent powers.<br />\nThose of us who were connected<br />\nwith<br />\nwith him cherish his memory as<br />\nthat of a sympathetic friend and<br />\na generous critic. And in this<br />\nUniversity, as lot* as it shall exist, he will be remembered as the<br />\nman whose genius illuminated its<br />\nyears, and whose devotion and ardor furnished the most inspiring<br />\nof all the elements which went to<br />\nmake those years so memorable<br />\nIntl fruitful.<br />\n<br />\nWORK HAD WORLD INFLUENCE<br />\n(Continued from page .5)<br />\n<br />\nSylvester's \"Spring's Debut\"<br />\nFrom \"The Academy,\u201d London, May 27, 1897 1<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to the translations<br />\ngiven in his quaint and littleknown \"Laws of Verse,\" which<br />\nhas long been out of print and is<br />\nhardly likely to be printed again,<br />\nthe late Prof. Sylvester was the<br />\nauthor, when at the ,Iqhns Hopkins University, of a rhyming<br />\n\"tour de .force\" called \"Spring's<br />\nDebut,\" privately issued in 1880.<br />\nIn itself the effort is interesting<br />\nfor the astounding variety of<br />\nknowledge postulated by its abstruse rhymes, but there also are<br />\ninteresting notes.<br />\n\"Spring's Debut,\" which is a<br />\nfantastic poem in praise of one<br />\nMary Winn, of Baltimore, consists of 213 seven-syallabled lines,<br />\nall ending in rhymes or asso'lances to this lady's name.

Al.,<br />\nin the lecture-room of the Mechanical Engineering Building,<br />\nthe Class of 1917 will consider a<br />\nplan worked out by the coMmittee<br />\nappointed by President Sutton at<br />\nthe senior banquet to raise a fund<br />\nof $25,000 for the University within the next twenty years.<br />\nThe delay in the execution of<br />\n-the idea conceived that night has<br />\nbeen due to the fact that the class<br />\nhas been considering the advisability of two opposing plans\u2014one,<br />\nto raise the fund by means of regular endowment insurance policies;<br />\nthe other, to raise it by each man<br />\npledging himself to pay a certain<br />\nsum into the fund every year for<br />\ntwenty years.<br />\nAfter a careful personal canvass, the members of the committee have found the sentiment of<br />\nthe class to be almost unanimously<br />\nin favor of the second plan. Several strong arguments are advanced to show why this method<br />\nof raising the fund would be far<br />\nbetter than putting the matter<br />\n.into the hands of an insurance<br />\ncompany.<br />\nIn the first place, it is argued<br />\nby those in favor of the second<br />\nplan, that paying the money directly into the fund will, with the<br />\nsame amount of annual payments,<br />\nresult in a far larger fund. In the<br />\nsecond place, the class, almost to a<br />\nman, would rather pay their<br />\nMoney directly into the fund than<br />\ncreate the fund indirectly through<br />\nthe medium of a company. In.the<br />\nthird place, it is pointed out \u2022 that<br />\nthe payments to which the men<br />\npledge themselves can be graded\u2014<br />\nsix dollars the first year after<br />\ngraduation, eight the second, ten<br />\nthe third, and so on. In this manner the payments will bear a direct<br />\nrelation to the probable growth of<br />\nearning power of the members of<br />\nthe class. It is estimated that the<br />\nmen can pay forty dollars far<br />\nmore easily twenty years after<br />\nthey have been graduated than<br />\nthey can twenty-five next year,<br />\nwhen the results of their education will not have had time to<br />\nmanifest themselves in concrete<br />\nform.<br />\nThe Endowment Fund Committee, consisting of Edward M. Stuart (chairman), Paul W. Sutton<br />\nand Reuben Oppenheimer, in view<br />\nof the unmistakable sentiment of<br />\nthe class, after consultation with<br />\nthe departments of -economics and<br />\nmathematics, has worked .\u2022 out a<br />\nplan which it believes in actual<br />\n<br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307<br />\n<br />\nN.

The<br />\nunderlying idea of the institution,<br />\nhowever, is the simple premise that,<br />\nin a college, intellectual enthusiasm<br />\nshould be as dominant in practice as<br />\nIt is in theory. THE NEWS-LETTER invites its readers to state their views<br />\nas to whether or not the type of college which Reed introduces should<br />\nsupplant the type to which it is opposed.\u2014EDIT0R.]<br />\n<br />\nhave adopted the orthography of<br />\nthe Simplified Spelling Board.<br />\nMany have done their best to be<br />\nof practical service to the communities in which they are situated.<br />\n\"In none of these particulars is<br />\nReed College unique, but it does<br />\nseem to be unique in the spirit<br />\nwhich is apparently in some cases<br />\na cause and in others an effect of<br />\nthe factors recorded above, and<br />\nwhich has resulted, in the words<br />\nof the President, 'in making<br />\nscholarship not only respectable<br />\nbut necessary, and, as a rule, not<br />\nonly necessary but attractive.' It<br />\nis only six years since Dr. William Trufant Foster, then professor of English and argumentation in Bowdoin College, was<br />\nelected president of Reed, with<br />\npower to invent a college spirit<br />\nand create traditions from the<br />\nground up and after five years<br />\nReed College has already a solid<br />\nrecord of achievementand has developed as well a college life in whose<br />\nflavor, as it appears to an alien<br />\nwho studies it only from the publications of the college or the students, the crusading zeal for<br />\nsimplified spelling, for instance,<br />\nappears to be quite as characteristic an element as the general interest in practical sociology.<br />\n\"'It seemed to me,' says President Foster, in describing the<br />\nfoundation of the college, 'that we<br />\ncould probably perform no greater<br />\nservice for the educational world<br />\nthan to use the endowment provided by the Reed family in an attempt to establish a college in<br />\nwhich intellectual enthusiasm<br />\nshould be dominant.<br />\n\"No one, I think, acquainted<br />\nwith this institution and with<br />\nothers is inclined to question the<br />\nfact that there is far more persistent and serious study at Reed<br />\nCollege today than would have<br />\nbeen possible had intellectual interests been obliged to compete<br />\nwith the distractions that commonly accompany the highly organized and expensive athletic<br />\nand social functions of American<br />\ncolleges. There are those who believe that Reed College is missing<br />\nsomething that other colleges have<br />\nbecause of these outside activities,<br />\nand there are a few who believe<br />\nthat the loss is serious. But even<br />\nthese people are ready to admit<br />\nthat the college has gained a large<br />\nmeasure of intellectual enthusiasm among its students, for which<br />\nthe sacrifices of certain aspects of<br />\ncollege life were deliberately made<br />\nat the outset.'\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Last June saw the completion<br />\nof the fifth college year and the<br />\ngraduation of the second class by<br />\nReed College of Portland, Oregon,<br />\nan institution which deserves, if<br />\nally college deserves it, the much<br />\nmisapplied adjective unique. There<br />\nare many peculiarities about Reed<br />\nCollege, or things that the conventional educator and the conventionally educated would regard<br />\nas peculiarities, but it is the combination of these features rather<br />\nthan any single one that makes<br />\nthe college distinctive.<br />\n\"Practically all of the 600 odd<br />\ncolleges and universities in the<br />\nUnited States are dedicated, theoretically, to the proposition that<br />\nintellectual progress and the creation or fostering of an enthusiasm.<br />\nfor the intellectual life are the<br />\nprime purpose of an institution of<br />\nlearning. Many colleges, to promote this or for other reasons,<br />\nhave abolished fraternities, or<br />\ndone away with intercollegiate<br />\nathletics. Several \u2022 colleges have<br />\nirregular requirements for admission, depending more on estimates<br />\nof the personal character and<br />\nability of the candidate than on<br />\nexaminations or certificates. At<br />\nleast one, besides Reed, requires a<br />\nthesis embodying the results of<br />\noriginal research from candidates<br />\nfor the baccalaureate degree, instead of reserving this for purely<br />\ngraduate work.<br />\n\"Many colleges have fairly complete honor systems, and various<br />\nforms of student self-government.<br />\nNot a few small colleges attempt<br />\nto discourage applicants for admission with the object of finally<br />\nadmitting only those whose determination to pursue the things<br />\nbest attainable at that particular<br />\nMistress\u2014Are you married?<br />\ncollege persists through many<br />\nMaid\u2014No'in, I bumped into a<br />\ntrials.

Knipp &amp; Sons<br /><br />\nSix men of the J ohns Hopkins<br />\ntrack team are being trained to<br />\nparticipate in the Penn Relays on<br />\nApril 28 and in the big annual<br />\nmeet of the Intercollegiate Amateur Athletic Association of America, which occurs May 25 and 26.<br />\nThough this step is apparently<br />\ncontrary to the recently adopted<br />\npolicy of the General Athletic Association of suspending all athletics at Hopkins, that body<br />\ndeemed it wise to permit the team<br />\nto take part in these two meets,<br />\nwhich are considered the biggest<br />\nevents in the track world of this<br />\ncountry.<br />\nAs it is the iron-bound rule of<br />\nthe I. C. A. A. A. A. that its members shall send men at least once<br />\nin two years to take part, and as<br />\nHopkins did not enter any men<br />\nlast year, the Athletic Association<br />\nis obliged to send men to it-this<br />\nyear, in order to retain its membership. Moreover, the men are<br />\npracticing at 6 o'clock, after battalion drill is over.<br />\nAs long as the men were training it seemed expedient to enter a<br />\nteam in the Penn Relays in which<br />\npractically all the big colleges<br />\nare<br />\n'<br />\nentered. In that meet, the team,<br />\nwhich will be picked from Captain Straus, Uhler, E. G. Hall,<br />\nWinslow, Weeks and Firor, will<br />\nrun against Fordham, Columbia,<br />\nGeorgetown and Pittsburgh.<br />\nThough Virginia is also entered in<br />\nthis race, it is doubtful as to<br />\nwhether it will compete. All these<br />\ncolleges are entering fast teams,<br />\nthe Fordham four being reputed<br />\nto- be among the best in the country.<br />\nCoach England is confident of a<br />\nvery excellent showing, as the<br />\nBlack and Blue men are being<br />\nrounded into splendid -form. It<br />\nmay be remembered that Uhler<br />\nwas one of the star performers of,<br />\nthe team during the past four<br />\nyears, that Weeks broke the South<br />\nAtlantic indoor two-mile record<br />\nat the George Washington University meet, that E. G. Hall won<br />\nthe open handicap quarter mile in<br />\nthe Georgetown meet and that<br />\nCaptain Straus won the open half<br />\nmile in the same meet. Winslow<br />\nand Firor have also past achievements and are expected to bring<br />\nhome points with the other four.<br />\nHopkins is placed in Class 1,<br />\njust below the championships, in<br />\nthe Penn Relays. In 1918 and<br />\n1914 Hopkins won its race, lost<br />\nin 1915 and did not compete in<br />\n1916.<br /><br />\nFURNITURE<br /><br />\nDECORATIONS<br /><br />\nDRAPERIES<br /><br />\n343 NORTH CHARLES STREET<br /><br />\nLUNCH AND DINING ROOMS<br />\nOn First Floor, 322 and 324 N.

His father's<br />\nname was Abraham Joseph, and<br />\nafter the father's death the eldest<br />\nboy moved to America and assumed the name of Sylvester, all<br />\nthe rest of the brothers following<br />\nthe example.<br />\nUntil he was fifteen years of<br />\nage, Sylvester was educated in<br />\nLondon, and it is said that even<br />\nat this time his gift for mathematics was very pronounced. In<br />\n1829 he went to Liverpool where<br />\nhe attended the Royal Institute.<br />\nHe only remained there for two<br />\nyears, but during this time established his reputation as a brilliant<br />\nmathematician.<br />\nIn 1831, when just over seven<br />\nteen, he entered St. John's College,<br />\nCambridge. He continued here<br />\nuntil the beginning of 1834, when<br />\nsickness compelled him to leave<br />\nIns work for a time. He re-entered<br />\ncollege in 1836 and took in final<br />\nexaminations in 1837,being placed<br />\nsecond on the list.<br />\nIn 1838 Sylvester was elected<br />\nto the professorship of natural<br />\nphilosophy at (what is now) University College, London. While<br />\nhere he also *as elected a Fellow<br />\nof the Royal Society and began to<br />\npublish articles on his chosen subject.<br />\nAfter three years he left the<br />\nOld World and took the, position<br />\nof professor of mathematics at tic'<br />\nUniversity of Virginia. His e-;perience here was disheartening,<br />\nand almost caused him to give 11,)<br />\nmathematics. He was not understood, and his brilliant mind wAs<br />\nnot given proper opportunities for<br />\ndevelopment. In addition, lie be<br />\ncame involved in slavery disputes<br />\nwith some of his students, and the<br />\nunpleasant feeling that developed<br />\nmade his life almost unbearable.<br />\nThe outcome was his immediate<br />\nreturn to England where he took<br />\na position as actuary with a life<br />\nassurance company. He remained<br />\nat this post for ten years before<br />\nagain returning to the teaching of<br />\nmathematics. In 1855 he was ap<br />\npointed professor of mathmalics<br />\nat the Royal Military Academy.<br />\nWoolwich, which position he held<br />\nfor fifteen years.<br />\nIn 1875 he was chosen to head<br />\nthe department of mathematics in<br />\nthe newly founded Johns Honkinq<br />\n1Thiversity. He remained at Ho-)kins until 1883. when. w*th<br />\npraise and gratitude or his colleagues in America rilwing, in his<br />\nears, he recrossed the Atlantic to<br />\nbecome Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford.<br /><br />\n\"You can not have a great university without such great<br />\nmen as Sylvester in your corps of teachers,\" wrote Prof. Benjamin Pierce to President Gilman, before the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity had been formally launched. \"I hope you will find<br />\nit in your heart to place him where he belongs, and the time<br />\nwill come when all the world will applaud the wisdom of your<br />\nselection.\"<br />\nPresident Gilman did find it in his heart to follow the advice\u2014<br />\nand Professor Pierce's prophecy has been fulfilled. The name<br />\nof Sylvester today is among the greatest of all the great names<br />\nwhich have adorned Hopkins' history. Coming to Baltimore a<br />\nstranger at the age of sixty-three, Sylvester, nevertheless, supported the ideals of the new university with a vigor and an enthusiasm unsurpassed by the youngest of his associates.<br />\nIt is not in the work he did, however, that Sylvester is alone<br />\ninteresting. The peculiarities of the man\u2014his marvelous erudition and sympathy with all branches of intellectual achievement, his keen interest in all things esthetic, the brilliancy of<br />\nhis attack upon the outworn narrowness of the English universities to which Hopkins was setting a new example, all give to<br />\nhis character a peculiar vividness. He brought to the University a touch of the Old World atmosphere; he personified the<br />\ncombination of venerable traditions with ever-youthful energy.<br /><br />\nSylvester, in the latter part of<br />\nIn March, 1897, while still actively working upon his beloved his life, made several experiments<br />\nmathematics, he had a paralytic in writing verse, among his .conseizure from which he never re- tributions being \"Rosalind\" and<br />\n\"Spring's Debut, a Town Idyll.\"<br />\ncovered.<br /><br />\nJAMES JOSEPH SYLVESTER<br />\nBy courtesy of The Alumni Magazine<br /><br />\nWORK HAD WORLD INFLUENCE<br />\nMade Hopkins a Center of Mathematical<br />\nResearch\u2014Inspired Pupils With His<br />\nZeal - First Editor of American<br />\nJournal of Mathematics.<br /><br />\nWhen the Johns Hopkins University was founded at Baltimore<br />\nin 1875, James Sylvester was<br />\nchosen as the first professor of<br />\nmathematics. He was given freerein and allowed to conduct his<br />\ndepartment as he saw fit. He<br />\nhad taught for a year at the University of Virginia, but he had<br />\nnot been appreciated there, and<br />\nafter his distasteful experience<br />\nand hasty return to England from<br />\nVirginia, he ventured again to the<br />\nNew World with pronounced<br />\nmisgivings. At Hopkins, however,<br />\nlie was allowed the perfect free(:0111 needed to bring out the full<br />\nforce of his character and ability.<br />\nAll during his stay at Hopkins,<br />\nSylvester emphasized what he believed to be the ideal method of<br />\nteaching \u2014 the combination instruction and research. It was<br />\nwhile teaching one of his pupils<br />\nthe \"New Algebra\" that Sylvester<br />\nhad an inspiration which eventually led to his discovery of the<br />\nproof of ,principles whose solution he had given up as hopeless.<br />\nWhen the American Journal a<br />\nMathematics was established at<br />\nthe University in 1878, it was put<br />\nunder the direction of Professor<br />\nSylvester. The first article he<br />\npublished in the Journal was an<br />\naccount of the application of the<br />\nnew atomic theory to the graphical representation of the concomitants of binary quantities.<br />\nDuring his stay at Hopkins,<br />\nFylvester, besides accomplishing a<br />\nvast amount of mathematical research work, was an inspiring<br />\nteacher. His ardor for his subject never waned. In the classroom his enthusiasm would invariably kindle, and he would lose<br />\nhimself in his work; his mind, although he was almost seventy,<br />\never active, ever searching for<br />\nnew principles. At times, in the<br />\ncourse of a lecture, he would suddenly see some new problem, leave<br />\nthe subject he happened to be<br />\nteaching, and work away on the<br />\nnew train of inquiry until the problem was solved. By carrying on his<br />\ninvestigations and researches before his class, he instilled into the<br />\nstudents a desire to do such work<br />\nfor themselves, besides showing<br />\nthem the methods pursued by the<br />\nskilled investigator.<br />\nWhen Professor Sylvester decided to leave the new University<br />\nthat Ile had assisted so much, the<br />\npresident called a farewell meeting in his honor on December 20,<br />\n1883, at which meeting the follow(Continued on page 6, col. 3)<br /><br />\n'1'HE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, APRIL 23, 1917.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nAddress Commemorative of Sylvester I<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nBy. FABIAN FRANKLIN, Ph. D.<br />\n[Delivered at a Memorial Meeting at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, May 2, 1897.1<br />\n* * * Of his work as a teacher,<br />\nI can speak only upon the basis<br />\nof his activity in this University.<br />\nThe one thing which constantly<br />\nmarked his lectures was enthusiastic love of the thing he was do<br />\ning. He had in the fullest possible degree, to use the Ftench<br />\nphrase, the defect of this quality;<br />\nfor as he almost always spoke<br />\nwith -enthusiastic ardor, so it was<br />\nalmost never possible for him to<br />\nspeak on \u2022 matters incapable of<br />\nevoking his ardor. In other<br />\nwords, the substance of his lectures had to consist largely \u2022of<br />\nhis own work, and, as a rule, of<br />\nwork hot from the forge. The<br />\nconsequence was that a continuous and systematic presentation<br />\nof any extensive body of doctrine<br />\nalready completed was not to be<br />\nexpected from him. Any unsolved<br />\ndifficulty; any suggested extension, such as would have been<br />\npassed by with a mention by other<br />\nlecturers, became with him inevitably the occasion of a digression<br />\nwhich was sure to consume many<br />\nweeks, if, indeed, it did not take<br />\nhim away from the original subject permanently. Nearly all of<br />\nthe important memoirs which he<br />\npublished while in Baltimore<br />\narose in this way. We who attended his lectures may be said to<br />\nhave seen these memoirs in the<br />\nmaking. He would give us on the<br />\nFriday the outcome of his grapplings with the enemy since the<br />\nTuesday lecture. Rarely can it<br />\nhave fallen to the lot of any<br />\nclass to follow so completely the<br />\nworkings of the mind of the master.<br />\nAs is well known, Sylvester had<br />\nan extraordinary faculty for the<br />\ncoinage of words, which, indeed,<br />\nwas merely a part of remarkable<br />\nkeen sense for language in gen<br />\neral. In this matter of the coinage of words, he doubtless went<br />\nto extremes, as he did in other<br />\nthings; but there can be no question of the great service he rendered to the new science of invariants by the creation of a whole<br />\nnew vocabulary which rendere.1<br />\npossible the crystallization of<br />\nthought in what would otherwise<br />\nhave been a comparatively amoropitons mass. There are doubtless<br />\nother departments of mathematics<br />\nwhich would have been more manageable by the skillful application<br />\nof just such a naine-creating faculty. Any mathematical conception with which Sylvester had<br />\nmuch to do had to be equipped<br />\nwish a name. He justly felt that<br />\nthe absence of it impeded thought,<br />\nand he could not be comfortable<br />\niii this state of things. His hearers will not forget how, after getting along for some time with the<br />\nnotation ( ), by which mathebeen content,<br />\nmaticans had<br /><br />\nOne of our great English judges observed on some occasion,<br />\nwhen he was outvoted by his brethren on the bench (or, perchance, it may have been the twelfth outstanding juryman, who<br />\nprotested that never before in his life had he been shut up with<br />\neleven other such obstinate men) that \"opinions ought to count<br />\nby weight rather than by number,\" and so I would say that the<br />\ngood done by a university is to be estimated not so much by the<br />\nmere'number of its members as by the spirit which actuates and<br />\nthe work that is done by them. When I hear, as I have heard,<br />\nof members of this University, only hoping to be enabled to keep<br />\nbody and soul together in order that they may continue to enjoy<br />\nthe advantages which it affords, it may be for a decade of years<br />\nto come; when I find classes diligently attending lectures on the<br />\nmost obstruse branches of scholarship and science, remote from<br />\nall the avenues which lead to fortune or public recognition; when<br />\nI observe the earnestness with which our younger members adof<br />\ndress themselves to the study of the place, and the absence<br />\ny<br />\nnecessit<br />\nthe<br />\nwithout<br />\nall manifestations of disorder or levity,<br />\nthat<br />\nme<br />\nto<br />\nit<br />\nseems<br />\n,<br />\nrestraint<br />\nexternal<br />\nany<br />\nof<br />\nfor the exercise<br />\nthis establishment, even in its cradle, better responds to what<br />\na<br />\nits name should import, more fully embodies the true idea of<br />\nhunwith<br />\nswarmed<br />\nrooms<br />\nlectureand<br />\nhalls<br />\nits<br />\nif<br />\nthan<br />\nty,<br />\nuniversi<br />\ndreds of idle and indifferent students,. or with students, diligent,<br />\neven<br />\nindeed, but working not from a pure love of knowledge, not<br />\nplaces<br />\nhigh<br />\nfor<br />\nbut<br />\ncrown,<br />\nfor the chaplet of olive, or the laurel<br />\nin examinations, for marks, as we say in England, the counters<br />\nlarge<br />\nor vouchers to enable their fortunate possessor to draw<br />\ncivil<br />\ne<br />\nlucrativ<br />\nor<br />\nip<br />\nfellowsh<br />\nsinecure<br />\nstakes out of the pool of<br />\non<br />\nr<br />\nSylveste<br />\nProf.<br />\nby<br />\nd<br />\ndelivere<br />\naddress<br />\nFrpm<br />\nments.\u2014<br />\nappoint<br />\n1877.<br />\n22,<br />\nCommemoration Day, February,<br />\nfrom the time of Legendre, to<br />\ndesignate the number of numbers<br />\nless than a given number and<br />\nprime to it, he came into the lecture-room one afternoon and began, in his most emphatic manner, thus:\"Gentlemen, I am about<br />\nto introduce to you a name that<br />\nhas been struggling for birth for<br />\na century!\"<br />\nAmerican names are no longer<br />\nabsent of the heroes of mathematics; but there are now among us<br />\na dozen universities in each of<br />\nwhich something, be it much or<br />\nlittle, is being added to that splendid monument of human thought<br />\nwhich bears the record of conquests made by so many of the<br />\nintellectual giants of the race.<br />\nAmong these giants, Sylvester has<br />\nwithout a question the right to be<br />\nreckoned. In the history of<br />\nmathematics, his place will t!ot be<br />\nwith the very greatest; but his<br />\nwork, brilliant and memorable- as<br />\nit was, affords no trpe measure of<br />\nhis intellectual greatness. Those<br />\nwho came within the sphere of<br />\nhis personality could not but feel<br />\nthat, through the force of circumstances, combined with the peculiarities of his poetic temperament, his performances, splendid<br />\nas it was, had not adequately reflected his magnificent powers.<br />\nThose of us who were connected<br />\nwith<br />\nwith him cherish his memory as<br />\nthat of a sympathetic friend and<br />\na generous critic.

Al.,<br />\nin the lecture-room of the Mechanical Engineering Building,<br />\nthe Class of 1917 will consider a<br />\nplan worked out by the coMmittee<br />\nappointed by President Sutton at<br />\nthe senior banquet to raise a fund<br />\nof $25,000 for the University within the next twenty years.<br />\nThe delay in the execution of<br />\n-the idea conceived that night has<br />\nbeen due to the fact that the class<br />\nhas been considering the advisability of two opposing plans\u2014one,<br />\nto raise the fund by means of regular endowment insurance policies;<br />\nthe other, to raise it by each man<br />\npledging himself to pay a certain<br />\nsum into the fund every year for<br />\ntwenty years.<br />\nAfter a careful personal canvass, the members of the committee have found the sentiment of<br />\nthe class to be almost unanimously<br />\nin favor of the second plan. Several strong arguments are advanced to show why this method<br />\nof raising the fund would be far<br />\nbetter than putting the matter<br />\n.into the hands of an insurance<br />\ncompany.<br />\nIn the first place, it is argued<br />\nby those in favor of the second<br />\nplan, that paying the money directly into the fund will, with the<br />\nsame amount of annual payments,<br />\nresult in a far larger fund. In the<br />\nsecond place, the class, almost to a<br />\nman, would rather pay their<br />\nMoney directly into the fund than<br />\ncreate the fund indirectly through<br />\nthe medium of a company. In.the<br />\nthird place, it is pointed out \u2022 that<br />\nthe payments to which the men<br />\npledge themselves can be graded\u2014<br />\nsix dollars the first year after<br />\ngraduation, eight the second, ten<br />\nthe third, and so on. In this manner the payments will bear a direct<br />\nrelation to the probable growth of<br />\nearning power of the members of<br />\nthe class. It is estimated that the<br />\nmen can pay forty dollars far<br />\nmore easily twenty years after<br />\nthey have been graduated than<br />\nthey can twenty-five next year,<br />\nwhen the results of their education will not have had time to<br />\nmanifest themselves in concrete<br />\nform.<br />\nThe Endowment Fund Committee, consisting of Edward M. Stuart (chairman), Paul W. Sutton<br />\nand Reuben Oppenheimer, in view<br />\nof the unmistakable sentiment of<br />\nthe class, after consultation with<br />\nthe departments of -economics and<br />\nmathematics, has worked .\u2022 out a<br />\nplan which it believes in actual<br /><br />\nThe Medical Standard Book Co.<br />\n307<br /><br />\nN.

The<br />\nunderlying idea of the institution,<br />\nhowever, is the simple premise that,<br />\nin a college, intellectual enthusiasm<br />\nshould be as dominant in practice as<br />\nIt is in theory. THE NEWS-LETTER invites its readers to state their views<br />\nas to whether or not the type of college which Reed introduces should<br />\nsupplant the type to which it is opposed.\u2014EDIT0R.]<br /><br />\nhave adopted the orthography of<br />\nthe Simplified Spelling Board.<br />\nMany have done their best to be<br />\nof practical service to the communities in which they are situated.<br />\n\"In none of these particulars is<br />\nReed College unique, but it does<br />\nseem to be unique in the spirit<br />\nwhich is apparently in some cases<br />\na cause and in others an effect of<br />\nthe factors recorded above, and<br />\nwhich has resulted, in the words<br />\nof the President, 'in making<br />\nscholarship not only respectable<br />\nbut necessary, and, as a rule, not<br />\nonly necessary but attractive.' It<br />\nis only six years since Dr. William Trufant Foster, then professor of English and argumentation in Bowdoin College, was<br />\nelected president of Reed, with<br />\npower to invent a college spirit<br />\nand create traditions from the<br />\nground up and after five years<br />\nReed College has already a solid<br />\nrecord of achievementand has developed as well a college life in whose<br />\nflavor, as it appears to an alien<br />\nwho studies it only from the publications of the college or the students, the crusading zeal for<br />\nsimplified spelling, for instance,<br />\nappears to be quite as characteristic an element as the general interest in practical sociology.<br />\n\"'It seemed to me,' says President Foster, in describing the<br />\nfoundation of the college, 'that we<br />\ncould probably perform no greater<br />\nservice for the educational world<br />\nthan to use the endowment provided by the Reed family in an attempt to establish a college in<br />\nwhich intellectual enthusiasm<br />\nshould be dominant.<br />\n\"No one, I think, acquainted<br />\nwith this institution and with<br />\nothers is inclined to question the<br />\nfact that there is far more persistent and serious study at Reed<br />\nCollege today than would have<br />\nbeen possible had intellectual interests been obliged to compete<br />\nwith the distractions that commonly accompany the highly organized and expensive athletic<br />\nand social functions of American<br />\ncolleges. There are those who believe that Reed College is missing<br />\nsomething that other colleges have<br />\nbecause of these outside activities,<br />\nand there are a few who believe<br />\nthat the loss is serious. But even<br />\nthese people are ready to admit<br />\nthat the college has gained a large<br />\nmeasure of intellectual enthusiasm among its students, for which<br />\nthe sacrifices of certain aspects of<br />\ncollege life were deliberately made<br />\nat the outset.'\"<br /><br />\n\"Last June saw the completion<br />\nof the fifth college year and the<br />\ngraduation of the second class by<br />\nReed College of Portland, Oregon,<br />\nan institution which deserves, if<br />\nally college deserves it, the much<br />\nmisapplied adjective unique. There<br />\nare many peculiarities about Reed<br />\nCollege, or things that the conventional educator and the conventionally educated would regard<br />\nas peculiarities, but it is the combination of these features rather<br />\nthan any single one that makes<br />\nthe college distinctive.<br />\n\"Practically all of the 600 odd<br />\ncolleges and universities in the<br />\nUnited States are dedicated, theoretically, to the proposition that<br />\nintellectual progress and the creation or fostering of an enthusiasm.<br />\nfor the intellectual life are the<br />\nprime purpose of an institution of<br />\nlearning. Many colleges, to promote this or for other reasons,<br />\nhave abolished fraternities, or<br />\ndone away with intercollegiate<br />\nathletics. Several \u2022 colleges have<br />\nirregular requirements for admission, depending more on estimates<br />\nof the personal character and<br />\nability of the candidate than on<br />\nexaminations or certificates. At<br />\nleast one, besides Reed, requires a<br />\nthesis embodying the results of<br />\noriginal research from candidates<br />\nfor the baccalaureate degree, instead of reserving this for purely<br />\ngraduate work.<br />\n\"Many colleges have fairly complete honor systems, and various<br />\nforms of student self-government.<br />\nNot a few small colleges attempt<br />\nto discourage applicants for admission with the object of finally<br />\nadmitting only those whose determination to pursue the things<br />\nbest attainable at that particular<br />\nMistress\u2014Are you married?<br />\ncollege persists through many<br />\nMaid\u2014No'in, I bumped into a<br />\ntrials.
