The S50 per credit hour<br />\nfee, however, is still comparable<br />\nto those charged by similar divisions at other local schools.<br />\nHe predicted that the rise will<br />\nprobably bring about a small decrease in Evening College enrollment, but said that enrollment<br />\nwill probably \"level off before<br />\ntoo long.\"<br />\nVerhaalen said that. cuts in<br />\nclasses, instructors, or hours of<br />\noperations will not be made to<br />\nsave funds. \"Unlike the day division,\" he stated, \"A removal of<br />\nan instructor means that a special<br />\nclass must be eliminated.\"<br />\n\"If the demand for that course<br />\nis present, we. must offer it or<br />\nlose students,\" he said.<br />\nThe Evening college is seeking<br />\nfunds from outside sources for<br />\n\"endowments, scholarships, and<br />\ncontract funding for certain<br />\nunique programs.\" Verhaalen<br />\nadded that these resources will,<br />\nincrease financial aid for students.<br />\n<br />\nHe stressed that enrollemnt at<br />\nthe Columbia Center and APL<br />\nevening program is essential to<br />\nthe Evening College's fiscal<br />\nsolvency. Said Verhaalen, \"We<br />\nare satisfied with continuing our<br />\noff-campus groupings of<br />\ncourses.\"<br />\nThe dean asserted that his division will probably receive a large<br />\n1975 allocation in accordance<br />\nwith the overall growth of the<br />\nUniversity budget.<br />\n\"We need the extra money to<br />\nmaintain a quality and diversified<br />\nprogram for the University.\"<br />\nVerhaalen denied charges that<br />\n66 percent of the College's funds<br />\nwere used for instructional purposes with the remaining third<br />\nunaccounted for.<br />\n\"That 30% is actually used for<br />\nindirect expenses such as wear on<br />\nthe Homewood physical plant,<br />\nsalaries for the central administrative staff, student services,<br />\nand library use,\" he explained.<br />\nThe priciple concern of the Evening College administration is<br />\nthe effect of recession and inflation on future enrollment. \"Part--<br />\n<br />\nCUS discusses grade inflation<br />\nBy PAT FLANNERY<br />\nThe Committee on Undergraduate Studies confronted the issue<br />\nof grade inflation at Hopkins and<br />\nthe implications of the national<br />\ntrend at its meeting yesterday.<br />\n\"What we're dealing with here<br />\nis a national concern: we'd better<br />\nfit ourselves into the national<br />\nscene on the basis of data, not<br />\npanic.\" stated Sigmund Suskind<br />\nDean of Academic Programs.<br />\nUndergraduate Repiesentative<br />\nDan Honk is presently working<br />\non a statistical analysis of student<br />\ngrades at Hopkins for the last five<br />\nyears in order to determine the<br />\ncum ributing factors of the recent<br />\nupward trend.<br />\n\"I'm trying to find out exactly where we are in realtion to<br />\n<br />\ngrade inflation.

Fewer courses were offered<br />\nthis year than ever before, and<br />\nfewer students participated than<br />\nin any other year, other than the<br />\nfirst year of the program.<br />\nLast year, after much debate<br />\nand discourse, the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, and then<br />\nthe Academic Council, voted to<br />\nretain intersession in its present<br />\nform. After the AC made this resolution, Dean of Academic Program Sigmund Suskind commented, \"The general feeling with respect to intersession, given its li-<br />\n<br />\nmitations and lack of structure is<br />\nthat people are happy with it.\"<br />\nThe fact of the matter was,<br />\nand still is, that students were<br />\nnot and are not satisified with intersession. They were happy with<br />\nthe basic structure of the program\u2014strictly voluntary with little pressure\u2014but not with the<br />\nway the faculty responded to it.<br />\nStudent support for intersession<br />\ncomes not from satisfaction with<br />\nthe program but from a fear that<br />\nit will be abolished or become a<br />\nnon-credit program.<br />\nA small group of faculty mein<br />\nbers contrived to make intersession just that, as the Mathematics<br />\ndepartment \"stacked\" a Faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly meeting with<br />\n<br />\nDr. Wrigley predicts<br />\nFall in population<br />\nBy STEVEN DUBNER<br />\n\"In ten years time there will<br />\nbe more people agitating about<br />\nunder-fertility than about over\u2014<br />\npopulation,\" forecast Dr,_ E.A.<br />\nWrigley, the visiting Hinkley Professor of History at Hopkins this<br />\nsemester. Wrigley, cited as one of<br />\nthe world's top five experts in<br />\nhistorical demography by Hisotry<br />\nChairman Orest Ranum, is offering the course \"Population<br />\nChange and the Industrial Revolution\" and will give two related<br />\nlectures during his 4 month stay.<br />\nWrigley, a fellow and bursar of<br />\nPeterhouse . College, Cambridge,<br />\nstated that his interest in historical demography grew out of an<br />\nearlier interest in the Industrial<br />\nRevolution, which he calls \"the<br />\nsingle most important event in<br />\nmodern history.\" His approach<br />\nto the field of historical demography concentrates on the structure of the family and changes<br />\naffecting it rather than studying<br />\ncensus data or economic statistics. By understanding the<br />\neffects of events on the family,<br />\nWrigley believes that a better understanding of history can be<br />\ngained.<br />\nThough essentially a historian,<br />\nWrigley recognizes the relevance<br />\nof his field to .the current world<br />\nsituation. He explained that there<br />\nhas been \"a sort of bandwagon<br />\neffect\" in his field, and though<br />\nhe is \"not a believer in making<br />\nforecasts,\" he did comment on<br />\ntoday's populaiton problems.<br />\nWrigley feels that the recent interest in Zero Population Growth<br />\n(ZPG); coupled with a recent<br />\ndrop in fertility, will cause con-<br />\n<br />\nF A<br />\n<br />\nWrigley<br />\n<br />\ncern in the future about declining<br />\npopulation among developed nations. As for underdeveloped nations, he sees \"little hope for optimism\" and predicts little or no<br />\nfall in population for the large<br />\nunderdeveloped nations.<br />\nThe author of numerous books<br />\nand articles, Wrigley helped<br />\nfound and now heads the prestigious Cambridge Group for History of Population and Social<br />\nStructure. His own current research centers about demographic trends in England from the<br />\nmid-sixteenth century to the<br />\nmid-nineteenth century.

Wrigley stated that he<br />\nwas enthusiastic about the post,<br />\nbecause his interests coicide with<br />\nthose of Hopkins' History Department. He is interested in<br />\nbroadening the study of history<br />\nto include related fields, such as<br />\nsocial anthropology, and hopes<br />\nto improve historians' knowledge<br />\n\"of ordinary people and their<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nWhile at Hopkins, Wrigley<br />\nplans to visit neighboring universities. His two talks here will concern \"the study of common<br />\npeople in the past and the history<br />\nof infa.nt mortality in England.\"<br />\n<br />\nits members, resulting in a 26-24<br />\nvote recommending that credit''<br />\nand grades be abolished for intersession. Though many faculty<br />\nmembers did not support that<br />\nvote, the proposal, which would<br />\nhave meant even less teaching<br />\nduring intersession, makes it fairly obvious that teachers here simply do not want to teach between semesters.<br />\nFaculty members view the January term as a valuable time to<br />\ncatch up on research and writing<br />\nand to prepare their course work<br />\nfor the upcoming semester.<br />\nAs one professor commented,<br />\n\"When the University starts recognizing teaching when contract<br />\nnegotiations roll around, then<br />\nyou'll see greater faculty participation in intersession.\" Faculty<br />\nmembers who believe that completing_their research is essential<br />\nto the securing of a promotion or<br />\nthe retention of a position, can<br />\nill-afford to teach during intersession.<br />\nThe faculty is not compensated financially 'for teaching du-<br />\n<br />\nring intersession.<br />\nHowever, if teachers are going<br />\nto teach to a significant extent,<br />\nthere would have to be some sort<br />\nof guarantee that students would<br />\nparticipate in the program.<br />\nThough intersession enrollment<br />\nstatistics indicate that a substantial portion of the student population (30-40 per cent) is eager to<br />\nparticipate, there would probably<br />\nhave to be some mechanism to<br />\ninsure that teachers who offer<br />\ncourses would have students<br />\nThe administration has been<br />\nwell aware of the problems with<br />\nintersession. Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Owen stated last<br />\nDecember that \"every department should give a certain number of minimester courses each<br />\nintersession.\" He explained that<br />\nthe departments should give the<br />\nnumber of courses equalling onesixth the number of those offered during the regular term.<br />\n,Technically, of course, Owen<br />\ncann'ot force the -academic departments to.offer courses. However, the persuasive powers of his<br />\noffice are formidable, inasmuch<br />\n<br />\n'Buckley Bill'guidelines issued<br />\nPresident Muller yesterday released revised guidelines for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act detailing compliance<br />\nwith the amendment to the bill<br />\nsigned into law by President Ford<br />\nDecember 31.<br />\nThe amendment to the muchcriticized \"Buckley Bill\" offers,<br />\naccording th the statement, corrections to many of the \"gross<br />\ndeficiencies\" which the bill contained in its original form.<br />\n<br />\nThe guidelines represent an interpretation of the specifics of<br />\nthe new bill by which \"the University will discharge its obligations under the new law.\" The<br />\npackage stipulates that in procedures involving the Privacy Act<br />\nthe term student \"shall mean any<br />\nperson 18 years of age or older<br />\nwho has been in attendance at<br />\nthe University.\"<br />\n\"The term 'records',\" the statement reads in part,\" will mean<br />\n<br />\nSteven Muller<br />\n<br />\nMuller names Executive Assistant<br />\nPresident Muller recently announced the appointment of<br />\nElaine Born as his Executive<br />\nAssistant.

Stam<br />\nLibrarian, M.S.E.L.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe nicest way to describe Alan<br />\nHirsch's review of the Hopkins<br />\nTheatre Coalition's first production, \"Guys and Dolls\" is \"lacking.\"<br />\nThough I do believe that many<br />\nof the points Mr. Hirsch presented<br />\nconcerning the professionalism of<br />\nthe show were accurate, I feel that<br />\nhe dwelled on those points more<br />\nthan is necessary, and in doing so,<br />\nmissed some of the finer aspects of<br />\nthe show.<br />\nHirsch stated that \"The supporting actors weren't very good.\" Yet<br />\nduring curtain calls on both Friday<br />\nand Saturday nights the cast received standing ovations from the audience, and the appearance of<br />\nNorman Schlossberger (NicelyNicely), Ira Shapiro (Benny Southstreet), April Moreno (Gen.<br />\nCartwright), Frank Cunat (Arvide<br />\nAbernathy), Bob Adler (Harry the<br />\nHorse), and Andy Savitz (Big Jule)<br />\nfor their bows brought resounding<br />\ncheers. Apparently Mr. Hirsch's<br />\nopinion of the supporting actors, a<br />\ngross generalization for which he<br />\noffered no support, was not a<br />\nunanimous one.<br />\nMr. Hirsch also states that, \"as a<br />\nproduction, though it was a little<br />\nbetter than .a second rate high<br />\nschool play.\" Yet the tech work<br />\ndone for \"Guys and Dolls,\" the<br />\nstage and set design, lighting and<br />\ncostuming (of which Hirsch made<br />\nno mention) was of a higher caliber<br />\nthan any high school production,<br />\nespecially considering the limitations of facilities and funds available.<br />\nI also think it's important to<br />\npoint out that Hopkins Theatre<br />\nCoalition was created not as a<br />\ntheatre group in contention with<br />\nthe Barnstormers, but merely as a<br />\nmeans for interested students to<br />\n<br />\nare to be commended for their<br />\nwork. Moreover, I believe that instead of dismissing the show as \"a<br />\nlack of talent\" and \"far below the<br />\nlevel of quality expected of<br />\nHopkins theatrical productions.\"<br />\nthat Mr. Hirsch should encourage<br />\nany potential that the Coalition<br />\nhas displayed which, in contrast to<br />\nhis statements, is considerable.<br />\nSue Matesic<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to voice support for<br />\nthe Psychology Department's<br />\n(abandoned) plan of requiring undergraduate majors to participate<br />\nin psychological experiments. I<br />\ncompleted the requirements for a<br />\npsych major at JHU last semester,<br />\nbut took a number of undergraduate psych courses at two other institutions, both of which required<br />\nparticipation in experiments as a<br />\ncourse requirement regardless of<br />\nthe students' academic major. The<br />\nmajority of students, myself included, agreed that although participation was at time inconvenient, we had learned first hand<br />\nabout the stucture of an experiment, the tediousness often involved for the experimenter, problems<br />\nencountered, etc. Often times we<br />\nactually had fun, many times we<br />\nwere amazed, and most of the time<br />\nwe were grateful to hear about experiments with human, rather than<br />\nanimal, subjects!

You also<br />\nmight notice that the entire top<br />\nslab of that wall is missing clear up<br />\nto Seventy-Seventh Street. If you<br />\nthen look over the wall, and gaze<br />\ndown below the elevated highway,<br />\nyou would discover the slabs, each<br />\nof which about five feet long, one<br />\nand one-half feet wide and a half a<br />\nfoot thick, of solid rock. They<br />\nhave fallen below to the surface,<br />\nbut a surface which is not the grass<br />\nof the park, but an extended metal<br />\ngrating over a nearly deserted,<br />\nunderground train tunnel.

It<br />\nyou then walked up to SeventySeventh Street, you would see an<br />\n<br />\nRPLA mentioned.<br />\nThe adults in the neighborhood<br />\nwere equally distressed about the<br />\nrecent political developments. It<br />\nbecame apparent that they were<br />\nnot oblivious to the significance of<br />\nthe park to their children. Furthermore, they had been promised repairs on an eroded highway, and<br />\nhad instead been confronted with<br />\nthe notion of an extended period<br />\nof reconstruction, probably lasting<br />\nseveral years. That meant that the<br />\ntraffic congestion on their streets<br />\nwould continue to worsen. One<br />\n'other simply determined factor<br />\nwas that the proposed interstate<br />\nhighway was designed for the benefit'of outsiders, not the resident<br />\nof the neighborhoods.<br />\nNo Way<br />\nThe West Side of Manhattan has<br />\nhad a heritage of political activism,<br />\nand those people who were distressed easily become willing and able<br />\nto do something about it. There<br />\nemerged spontaneous coalition<br />\ngroups to save the park. People<br />\nwore buttons which proclaimed:<br />\n\"NO HIGHWAY, NO WAY.\" They<br />\npicketed, assembled, and spoke out<br />\nday after day, far into the spring.<br />\nThey were not disturbed by police<br />\narrests made to dissuade them.

The vast majority of<br />\nthe people of New York City have<br />\nnever been told what happened<br />\nwhen this neighborhood on the<br />\nWest Side of Manhattan was told<br />\nthat its park would be destroyed.<br />\nThere are apparently a lot of people who would like to see, that<br />\nstate of general ignorance maintained.<br />\nThere is a prevailing rumor in<br />\nthat neighborhood that the damage<br />\nwas done be an itinerant gang of<br />\nPuerto Ricans.

It was five-thirty. The window afforded me a limited<br />\nview, and I occupied myself by appraising<br />\nthe narrow alleys. Upon our arrival, everyone arose to stretch and to collect their<br />\nbelongings, and got off.<br />\nI made the acquaintance of two Marines, and inquired of them the most convenient way of getting to the Cellar Door,<br />\na nightclub in Georgetown. One of them<br />\ndidn't seem very interested. He was a big<br />\ndumb-looking guy, and he tried his best<br />\nto ignore me. In fact, we had been sitting<br />\nfor the past hour without saying a word,<br />\nor in his case, I might say, a grunt. The<br />\nother gentleman was considerably more<br />\nintelligent, however, and was very friendly. \"You don't want to go wandering<br />\naround here,\" lie cautioned. \"There are a<br />\nlot of fairies out, and worse, so watch it.\"<br />\nOnce inside the terminal building, he pointed me in the direction of the Information Booth. \"Now you just ask that woman how to get to Georgetown. We'll be<br />\nright back. Don't move from that spot<br />\nuntil we come back.\"<br />\nI made my.way through the crowd to<br />\nthe booth. I greeted the woman and<br />\nexplained my situation. \"I've just arrived<br />\nfrom Baltimore on the 4:45. I'm trying to<br />\nget to this nightclub in Georgetown, the<br />\nCellar Door, before eight o'clock. What<br />\ndo you think I should do?\" The woman's<br />\nglance was skeptical. \"I think you should<br />\nget on that bus and go right back to<br />\nBaltimore,\"she replied.<br />\nPresently my friends returned. We<br />\nstood for a moment, and the two Marines<br />\nconversed softly with each other. At once<br />\nthere appeared beside me a fat, old, white-haired man, who began talking to me.<br />\nHe seemed interested in my pen, and questioned me about it. He seemed very friendly\u2014too friendly, in. fact; my friends<br />\ntook me aside. The smart one shook his<br />\nhead. \"See what I told you? He's one of<br />\nthe fairies.\" I was a little disconcerted.<br />\nWhen I turned to find him, he had already stumbled away, looking a little chagrined.<br />\nI decided to take a cab, and so we<br />\nmoved outside. After an hour of waiting,<br />\nI noticed a cab some distance off driven<br />\nby a young black girl. She seemed to be<br />\nwaving to me. I instinctively turned to<br />\nmy friends but they had disappeared; I<br />\nlooked about for a moment but could see<br />\nno sign of them. Crossing the street, I<br />\nmade my way in an awkwardly cautious<br />\nfashion to the cab. Yes, she would take<br />\nme to the Cellar Door, for a mere dollar<br />\nand a quarter. She was very friendly and<br />\nquite attractive. I thanked her and got in.<br />\nWe talked for awhile and she apparently found my behavior to be rather amusing. To her I sounded like a hick, which<br />\nof course was an accurate- appraisal. She<br />\nrestored in me some degree of confidence<br />\nand upon our arrival at the Cellar Door, I<br />\nthanked her warmly and gave her three<br />\ndollars, which was regrettably the most I<br />\ncould afford.<br />\nTo the passing observer, the Cellar<br />\nDoor was unimpressive. The building itself was old and worn. Curtained windows afforded no glimpse of the interior.<br />\nThere was a doorway facing the street,<br />\nbut it was securely boarded up and padlocked. Further investigation revealed an<br />\nunobtrusive side entrance with a small<br />\nwindow, easily overlooked from the<br />\nstreet. This outward appearance might<br />\nwell have led one to believe that the building had fallen out of use, if not for the<br />\ntwo large posters in the windows. \u2022<br />\nThe Cellar Door<br />\nTON IGHT<br />\nLEON REDBONE\u2014CHRIS SMITIIER<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\ngreeted with a grunt of apProval.

This paper<br />\nwould supply all the information<br />\nconcerning bars and their prices, concerts,<br />\nand the location of all night diners in<br />\ntown. The name would be unmistakable:<br />\nThe Baltimore Hedonist.<br />\nWith the conviction that an outstanding cover story would solve my problems,<br />\nI attended the Second Annual End of the<br />\nWorld Show at the B DWAY(R,O,and A<br />\nare missing from the marquis). As I could<br />\ngather, this show would serve as a telethon for the demented Baltimore freak<br />\ncommunity. Perhaps if wasted enough,<br />\nthe audience could foretell what the last<br />\njudgement would be like, for this was a<br />\nvision of a stoned apocalypse. The emcee<br />\nwas wearing a softball jersey and had a<br />\nglib Jerry Lewis style of speaking. There<br />\nwas no phone calling or pledging of<br />\nmoney involved, but there was a countdown of sorts inaugurated by our host, as<br />\nhe reminded us after and before each<br />\ngroup played that .Miss Edith Massey, the<br />\nstar of Pink Flamingo would be on stage<br />\nat midnight. Apparently, this was one of<br />\nthe key reasons why so many had assembled for six hours of local talent.<br />\nFor those of you who have never<br />\nventured to the B DWAY, a few words<br />\nare in order. Located near the junction of<br />\nEastern Avenue and South Broadway,<br />\nthis once diapidated edifice remains<br />\ntoday. On the inside it looks like there<br />\nwas once a fire and flood at the same<br />\ntime. There are huge portholes of green<br />\nlight and decorated serpents on the wall<br />\npanels, whose color ranges from the pink<br />\nof a tongue burnt by funky smoking to<br />\nthe purple of a liver done in by booze.<br />\nSuch architecture has been recognized by<br />\nour society as a monument of an era<br />\nmore twisted than our own, and so it is<br />\npreserved to remind culture of the competition for The Most Wanton Epoch of<br />\nHistory. However, I could walk into this<br />\ntheatre with a six pack and the leftovers<br />\nof a quart of Black Label, so I can't complain.<br />\nThe first group to perform was RAZOR, an Alice-Cooper-esque group with<br />\n\"original\" material. The lead singer began<br />\nthe act by changing from a sleezy Palm<br />\n<br />\nOcean Rose in concert last October.' Halloween nights, etc.<br />\nBeach suit to a black see-thru dress. After<br />\nthe first song, instead of saying thank<br />\nyou, he replied, \"Lipstick on your<br />\ncrotch.\" Somewhat redundant was their<br />\nsong, \"The Girl with the Fuck-Me<br />\nShoes.\" RAZOR was a lousy act, so it<br />\nwas easy to get into some heavy drinking.<br />\nBodily abuse was in order and we needed<br />\nrefuelling, we skipped out to the local<br />\nbars.<br />\nB'DWAY<br />\nAfter a few drinks and a few toots, we<br />\nwandered to the Acropolis Bar for some<br />\nGreek food and balalaika music. When we<br />\nreturned to the B DWAY, three hours<br />\nlater, the crowd was fired up. Once the<br />\nChesapeake Retrievers began their intense<br />\nbluegrass, the aisles were filled with dancers. I remember one mondo in particular<br />\nwho looked like H.R. Haldeman's bastard<br />\nand who was moving his skinhead in time<br />\nwith the music like a chicken\u2014just another crazy country instrument I guess. After<br />\nthe Retrievers had finished, the crowd<br />\nwas buzzing as if returning from a long<br />\nday in a machine shop.<br />\nOcean Rose was next, and they were<br />\nthe only group not allowed 45 minutes<br />\nplaying time. They would only play six<br />\n<br />\ntunes (among them the memorable<br />\n\"Buccaneer\") as the emcee was hyped up<br />\non getting big Edith on stage. He didn't<br />\ncare that Ocean Rose was the best performance of the evening. (Thinking that a<br />\nbutane lighter on high flame would cause<br />\na round of lit matches, an encore, and<br />\nthreaten fire to the emcee, I thrust the<br />\nblowtorch into the air. The crowd did not<br />\nwant to ke9p the emcee in line nor Ocean<br />\nRose on stage, so there I stood, a statue<br />\nof liberty amidst a throng of foreigners.)<br />\nWith the arrival of the Edith Massey<br />\nentourage, the crowd went into a frenzy.<br />\nI soon had a haunting vision of the missing letters on the theatre marquis as the<br />\ncrowd chanted: \"Edith, E-dit, Eat it,<br />\nEdith.\" ROA. Edith's back up group began with a jazz arrangement that sounded<br />\nlike some of Freddie Hubbard's stuff\u2014the<br />\nhorn solo is still reverberating in my head.<br />\nWhen this was finished, two go-go<br />\ndancers, dressed like the cat women of<br />\nthe science fiction flick of the same<br />\nname, sang and danced to \"Sexy Ida.\"<br />\nThe crowd was really going, and I have<br />\nnever witnessed such deprivation Shouts<br />\nof Edith ROA continued, and then, as if<br />\nthe comet Kohoutek hit the stage, this<br />\n<br />\nbig mama burst into the theatre.<br />\nShe was disgusting\u2014some of her teeth<br />\nwere missing and she had huge red<br />\nsplotches of eyeshadow on her forehead.<br />\nI was getting sick from t he radiation her<br />\nred and silver-sequined sack threw off. She<br />\nsang and danced to a long rendition of<br />\n\"Let Me Entertain You.\" Every time she<br />\nrevealed her drumsticks to the lepers in<br />\nthe crowd went bullshit, and I was starting to get the dry heaves. Then from nowhere, two women dressed in Lou Reed<br />\ndrag madeit on to the stage, and punched<br />\nout the cat women. One of them had had<br />\nher pants unzipped all the while to reveal<br />\nher hindquarters, -and when she took off<br />\nher clothes, it came as no surprise.<br />\nYucch!<br />\nI don't know whether it was the<br />\nScotch or the beer, or the innumerable<br />\ntoots, but I was ill, and when this bony-S<br />\nassed stripper thrust her wrinkled tushy<br />\ninto our faces, I gagged and bolted down<br />\nthe aisle to the bathroom which was some<br />\nthirty steps underground.

Calypso becameCalypso Prelim\u00b0, an<br />\nexpression of support for the Mozambique Liberation Party, who opposed the<br />\nwhite rule of Mozambique. Duke<br />\n<br />\nEllington died. But the music is essentially<br />\nthe same.<br />\nFor the most part, the album lives up<br />\nto its expected value. It is a new direction, for Miles and for us, but it builds off<br />\nof the old. The last several albums Miles<br />\nhas done were very concerned with colour and texture, much like the music of<br />\nKarlheinz Stockhausen. In Get Up With<br />\nIt, Miles is just as colour oriented, but he<br />\nhas turned somewhat more lyrical, as he<br />\nwas in the late fifties and sixties, and the<br />\nCarribean rhythmic influence is unmistakable. The band, too, has changed:<br />\nMiles used to use as many as four keyboard and one guitar, and here- uses two<br />\nor three guitars and only occassional keyboard (which he himself provides).<br />\nThe result is effective; this is one of the<br />\nbest bancls that Miles has ever had.<br />\nMichael Henderson on bass provides the<br />\nfoundation for the rhythmic and harmonic embellishments of Mtume,congas,<br />\nand Reggie Lucas, guitar. Sonny Fortune's sax is most notably effective on<br />\nMaiysha, and Davis himself uses an 'economy of notes to create his effect.<br />\nI do have one complaint, though, and<br />\nit not the music. It's Columbia records.<br />\n<br />\nTwo cuts on the album are totally different from all the others. One is Red China<br />\nBlues, a short, straight funky blues that<br />\nseems tailor made for airplay. It's a good<br />\ntune, but it seems to be an obvious ploy<br />\nfor sales.<br />\nHowever, Honky Tonk is not. Honky<br />\nTonk is a moderately interesting cut that<br />\nwas recorded in 1970. A small section of<br />\nit was used as a bridge from a studio session to a live session in Sivad from the<br />\nLive-Evil album. It's recycled Miles, and<br />\nfrankly I'd rather hear new Miles.<br />\nSo why is it on the album? A quote<br />\nfrom Columbia ad for the album explains<br />\nthat \"All along, musicians like John<br />\nMclaughlin, Billy Cobham, Herbie<br />\nHancock and Keith Jarrett are performing with urgency and brilliance.\" Bullshit.<br />\nTheir urgency and brilliance\" lasts exactly 5'54\". Why is Columbia trying to hype<br />\nthe public? The same reason as always:<br />\ncorporate greed. Miles' new band has no<br />\neasily recognizable \"names\" in it, So the<br />\npeople at Columbia thought they'd pad<br />\nthe ad. And for what it's worth, last time<br />\nI checked, Get Up Witlz It was on it's way<br />\ninto Billboard's top 100 albums like a<br />\nbullet.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 12/news-letter/february 7, 1975<br />\n<br />\nMidshipmen dunk Hopkins hoopsters<br />\nBY STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nThe Midshipmen of the Naval<br />\nAcademy proved to be less than<br />\ngracious hosts on Wednesday<br />\nwhen they blew the Hopkins<br />\nbasketball team out of Halsey<br />\nField House, 82-53.<br />\nThis game marked the second<br />\nconsecutive contest in which the<br />\nBlue Jays ventured, unsuccessfully, into Division 1, losing first to<br />\nDrexel and coupled with the defeat at Annapolis, dropped the<br />\nJays season record to 6-9.<br />\nSurprisingly, considering the<br />\nscore, the game was a closely contested battle for three-quarters<br />\nof the game. To defend against<br />\nNavy's 6'8\", 6'7\" frontline,<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert installed a<br />\n1-3-1 zone defense to provide<br />\nHopkins with better rebounding<br />\nand for most of the game, the<br />\nstrategy proved successful.<br />\nNavy jumped to a 22-11 lead<br />\nin the first half but the Jays came<br />\nback to cut the deficit to 22-19,<br />\nholding the Middies scoreless for<br />\na six minute span. The first half<br />\nended with the Jays still very<br />\nmuch in the game, trailing 26-21.<br />\n\"We successfully employed<br />\nour strategy, that was to control<br />\nthe tempo and make Navy play<br />\nour game,\" said Coach Rupert.<br />\n\"We limited their fast break and<br />\nsuccessfully held our own off the<br />\nboards.\" The sailors had only one<br />\nmore rebound than the Jays in<br />\nthe first half. \"We did everything<br />\nright in the first half,\" Rupert<br />\ncontinued, \"except put the ball<br />\nin the hoop.\" Statistics bear out<br />\nthat fact; Hopkins connected on<br />\nonly 22% of its shots in the opening stanza.<br />\n\"Both teams played a horrendous first half,\" agreed Navy<br />\nCoach Dave Smalley. \"Our shooting was atrocious. We just<br />\ncouldn't seem to do anything<br />\nright.\"<br />\nThe game remained close<br />\nthrough the first eight minutes of<br />\nthe second half as well. However<br />\nat that point all hell broke loose.<br />\nAhead by three, the Midshipmen<br />\napplied a full-court man-to-man<br />\ntrapping press and the<br />\nHomewood quintet lost its composure and the ballgame.<br />\nThe Middies' forced the Jays<br />\ninto numerous turnovers and<br />\ncontinually converted layups after steals in the backcourt.

The teams<br />\ntraded baskets the rest of the<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"The same thing happened this<br />\ntime as has happened the past<br />\nfour times we,'ve played them,\"<br />\n<br />\nsaid Rupert. \"We stay in the first<br />\nthree-quarters of the game and<br />\nthen they blow us out. We may<br />\nhave been nervous, playing in big<br />\n-time surroundings for the first<br />\ntime this season, but we were<br />\nprepared for the game. We knew<br />\nthey had an excellent press with<br />\nquick, physical guards.

Fewer courses were offered<br />\nthis year than ever before, and<br />\nfewer students participated than<br />\nin any other year, other than the<br />\nfirst year of the program.<br />\nLast year, after much debate<br />\nand discourse, the Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Studies, and then<br />\nthe Academic Council, voted to<br />\nretain intersession in its present<br />\nform. After the AC made this resolution, Dean of Academic Program Sigmund Suskind commented, \"The general feeling with respect to intersession, given its li-<br /><br />\nmitations and lack of structure is<br />\nthat people are happy with it.\"<br />\nThe fact of the matter was,<br />\nand still is, that students were<br />\nnot and are not satisified with intersession. They were happy with<br />\nthe basic structure of the program\u2014strictly voluntary with little pressure\u2014but not with the<br />\nway the faculty responded to it.<br />\nStudent support for intersession<br />\ncomes not from satisfaction with<br />\nthe program but from a fear that<br />\nit will be abolished or become a<br />\nnon-credit program.<br />\nA small group of faculty mein<br />\nbers contrived to make intersession just that, as the Mathematics<br />\ndepartment \"stacked\" a Faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly meeting with<br /><br />\nDr. Wrigley predicts<br />\nFall in population<br />\nBy STEVEN DUBNER<br />\n\"In ten years time there will<br />\nbe more people agitating about<br />\nunder-fertility than about over\u2014<br />\npopulation,\" forecast Dr,_ E.A.<br />\nWrigley, the visiting Hinkley Professor of History at Hopkins this<br />\nsemester. Wrigley, cited as one of<br />\nthe world's top five experts in<br />\nhistorical demography by Hisotry<br />\nChairman Orest Ranum, is offering the course \"Population<br />\nChange and the Industrial Revolution\" and will give two related<br />\nlectures during his 4 month stay.<br />\nWrigley, a fellow and bursar of<br />\nPeterhouse . College, Cambridge,<br />\nstated that his interest in historical demography grew out of an<br />\nearlier interest in the Industrial<br />\nRevolution, which he calls \"the<br />\nsingle most important event in<br />\nmodern history.\" His approach<br />\nto the field of historical demography concentrates on the structure of the family and changes<br />\naffecting it rather than studying<br />\ncensus data or economic statistics. By understanding the<br />\neffects of events on the family,<br />\nWrigley believes that a better understanding of history can be<br />\ngained.<br />\nThough essentially a historian,<br />\nWrigley recognizes the relevance<br />\nof his field to .the current world<br />\nsituation. He explained that there<br />\nhas been \"a sort of bandwagon<br />\neffect\" in his field, and though<br />\nhe is \"not a believer in making<br />\nforecasts,\" he did comment on<br />\ntoday's populaiton problems.<br />\nWrigley feels that the recent interest in Zero Population Growth<br />\n(ZPG); coupled with a recent<br />\ndrop in fertility, will cause con-<br /><br />\nF A<br /><br />\nWrigley<br /><br />\ncern in the future about declining<br />\npopulation among developed nations. As for underdeveloped nations, he sees \"little hope for optimism\" and predicts little or no<br />\nfall in population for the large<br />\nunderdeveloped nations.<br />\nThe author of numerous books<br />\nand articles, Wrigley helped<br />\nfound and now heads the prestigious Cambridge Group for History of Population and Social<br />\nStructure. His own current research centers about demographic trends in England from the<br />\nmid-sixteenth century to the<br />\nmid-nineteenth century.

Wrigley stated that he<br />\nwas enthusiastic about the post,<br />\nbecause his interests coicide with<br />\nthose of Hopkins' History Department. He is interested in<br />\nbroadening the study of history<br />\nto include related fields, such as<br />\nsocial anthropology, and hopes<br />\nto improve historians' knowledge<br />\n\"of ordinary people and their<br />\nsociety.\"<br />\nWhile at Hopkins, Wrigley<br />\nplans to visit neighboring universities.

Though many faculty<br />\nmembers did not support that<br />\nvote, the proposal, which would<br />\nhave meant even less teaching<br />\nduring intersession, makes it fairly obvious that teachers here simply do not want to teach between semesters.<br />\nFaculty members view the January term as a valuable time to<br />\ncatch up on research and writing<br />\nand to prepare their course work<br />\nfor the upcoming semester.<br />\nAs one professor commented,<br />\n\"When the University starts recognizing teaching when contract<br />\nnegotiations roll around, then<br />\nyou'll see greater faculty participation in intersession.\" Faculty<br />\nmembers who believe that completing_their research is essential<br />\nto the securing of a promotion or<br />\nthe retention of a position, can<br />\nill-afford to teach during intersession.<br />\nThe faculty is not compensated financially 'for teaching du-<br /><br />\nring intersession.<br />\nHowever, if teachers are going<br />\nto teach to a significant extent,<br />\nthere would have to be some sort<br />\nof guarantee that students would<br />\nparticipate in the program.<br />\nThough intersession enrollment<br />\nstatistics indicate that a substantial portion of the student population (30-40 per cent) is eager to<br />\nparticipate, there would probably<br />\nhave to be some mechanism to<br />\ninsure that teachers who offer<br />\ncourses would have students<br />\nThe administration has been<br />\nwell aware of the problems with<br />\nintersession. Dean of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Owen stated last<br />\nDecember that \"every department should give a certain number of minimester courses each<br />\nintersession.\" He explained that<br />\nthe departments should give the<br />\nnumber of courses equalling onesixth the number of those offered during the regular term.<br />\n,Technically, of course, Owen<br />\ncann'ot force the -academic departments to.offer courses.

Apparently Mr. Hirsch's<br />\nopinion of the supporting actors, a<br />\ngross generalization for which he<br />\noffered no support, was not a<br />\nunanimous one.<br />\nMr. Hirsch also states that, \"as a<br />\nproduction, though it was a little<br />\nbetter than .a second rate high<br />\nschool play.\" Yet the tech work<br />\ndone for \"Guys and Dolls,\" the<br />\nstage and set design, lighting and<br />\ncostuming (of which Hirsch made<br />\nno mention) was of a higher caliber<br />\nthan any high school production,<br />\nespecially considering the limitations of facilities and funds available.<br />\nI also think it's important to<br />\npoint out that Hopkins Theatre<br />\nCoalition was created not as a<br />\ntheatre group in contention with<br />\nthe Barnstormers, but merely as a<br />\nmeans for interested students to<br /><br />\nare to be commended for their<br />\nwork. Moreover, I believe that instead of dismissing the show as \"a<br />\nlack of talent\" and \"far below the<br />\nlevel of quality expected of<br />\nHopkins theatrical productions.\"<br />\nthat Mr. Hirsch should encourage<br />\nany potential that the Coalition<br />\nhas displayed which, in contrast to<br />\nhis statements, is considerable.<br />\nSue Matesic<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to voice support for<br />\nthe Psychology Department's<br />\n(abandoned) plan of requiring undergraduate majors to participate<br />\nin psychological experiments. I<br />\ncompleted the requirements for a<br />\npsych major at JHU last semester,<br />\nbut took a number of undergraduate psych courses at two other institutions, both of which required<br />\nparticipation in experiments as a<br />\ncourse requirement regardless of<br />\nthe students' academic major. The<br />\nmajority of students, myself included, agreed that although participation was at time inconvenient, we had learned first hand<br />\nabout the stucture of an experiment, the tediousness often involved for the experimenter, problems<br />\nencountered, etc. Often times we<br />\nactually had fun, many times we<br />\nwere amazed, and most of the time<br />\nwe were grateful to hear about experiments with human, rather than<br />\nanimal, subjects! We were exposed<br />\nto the environment which eventually constituted the basis of the<br />\ntheories we heard in class.<br />\nPerhaps a sincere student could<br />\nview mandatory participation as an<br />\nopportunity to further his education, to experience an aspect of the<br />\nfield outside the classroom, rather<br />\nthan as another requirement to be<br />\ncircumvented.

You also<br />\nmight notice that the entire top<br />\nslab of that wall is missing clear up<br />\nto Seventy-Seventh Street. If you<br />\nthen look over the wall, and gaze<br />\ndown below the elevated highway,<br />\nyou would discover the slabs, each<br />\nof which about five feet long, one<br />\nand one-half feet wide and a half a<br />\nfoot thick, of solid rock. They<br />\nhave fallen below to the surface,<br />\nbut a surface which is not the grass<br />\nof the park, but an extended metal<br />\ngrating over a nearly deserted,<br />\nunderground train tunnel.

It<br />\nbecame apparent that they were<br />\nnot oblivious to the significance of<br />\nthe park to their children. Furthermore, they had been promised repairs on an eroded highway, and<br />\nhad instead been confronted with<br />\nthe notion of an extended period<br />\nof reconstruction, probably lasting<br />\nseveral years. That meant that the<br />\ntraffic congestion on their streets<br />\nwould continue to worsen. One<br />\n'other simply determined factor<br />\nwas that the proposed interstate<br />\nhighway was designed for the benefit'of outsiders, not the resident<br />\nof the neighborhoods.<br />\nNo Way<br />\nThe West Side of Manhattan has<br />\nhad a heritage of political activism,<br />\nand those people who were distressed easily become willing and able<br />\nto do something about it. There<br />\nemerged spontaneous coalition<br />\ngroups to save the park. People<br />\nwore buttons which proclaimed:<br />\n\"NO HIGHWAY, NO WAY.\" They<br />\npicketed, assembled, and spoke out<br />\nday after day, far into the spring.<br />\nThey were not disturbed by police<br />\narrests made to dissuade them.

It was five-thirty. The window afforded me a limited<br />\nview, and I occupied myself by appraising<br />\nthe narrow alleys. Upon our arrival, everyone arose to stretch and to collect their<br />\nbelongings, and got off.<br />\nI made the acquaintance of two Marines, and inquired of them the most convenient way of getting to the Cellar Door,<br />\na nightclub in Georgetown. One of them<br />\ndidn't seem very interested. He was a big<br />\ndumb-looking guy, and he tried his best<br />\nto ignore me. In fact, we had been sitting<br />\nfor the past hour without saying a word,<br />\nor in his case, I might say, a grunt. The<br />\nother gentleman was considerably more<br />\nintelligent, however, and was very friendly. \"You don't want to go wandering<br />\naround here,\" lie cautioned. \"There are a<br />\nlot of fairies out, and worse, so watch it.\"<br />\nOnce inside the terminal building, he pointed me in the direction of the Information Booth. \"Now you just ask that woman how to get to Georgetown. We'll be<br />\nright back. Don't move from that spot<br />\nuntil we come back.\"<br />\nI made my.way through the crowd to<br />\nthe booth. I greeted the woman and<br />\nexplained my situation. \"I've just arrived<br />\nfrom Baltimore on the 4:45. I'm trying to<br />\nget to this nightclub in Georgetown, the<br />\nCellar Door, before eight o'clock. What<br />\ndo you think I should do?\" The woman's<br />\nglance was skeptical. \"I think you should<br />\nget on that bus and go right back to<br />\nBaltimore,\"she replied.<br />\nPresently my friends returned. We<br />\nstood for a moment, and the two Marines<br />\nconversed softly with each other. At once<br />\nthere appeared beside me a fat, old, white-haired man, who began talking to me.<br />\nHe seemed interested in my pen, and questioned me about it. He seemed very friendly\u2014too friendly, in. fact; my friends<br />\ntook me aside. The smart one shook his<br />\nhead. \"See what I told you? He's one of<br />\nthe fairies.\" I was a little disconcerted.<br />\nWhen I turned to find him, he had already stumbled away, looking a little chagrined.<br />\nI decided to take a cab, and so we<br />\nmoved outside. After an hour of waiting,<br />\nI noticed a cab some distance off driven<br />\nby a young black girl. She seemed to be<br />\nwaving to me. I instinctively turned to<br />\nmy friends but they had disappeared; I<br />\nlooked about for a moment but could see<br />\nno sign of them. Crossing the street, I<br />\nmade my way in an awkwardly cautious<br />\nfashion to the cab. Yes, she would take<br />\nme to the Cellar Door, for a mere dollar<br />\nand a quarter. She was very friendly and<br />\nquite attractive. I thanked her and got in.<br />\nWe talked for awhile and she apparently found my behavior to be rather amusing. To her I sounded like a hick, which<br />\nof course was an accurate- appraisal. She<br />\nrestored in me some degree of confidence<br />\nand upon our arrival at the Cellar Door, I<br />\nthanked her warmly and gave her three<br />\ndollars, which was regrettably the most I<br />\ncould afford.<br />\nTo the passing observer, the Cellar<br />\nDoor was unimpressive. The building itself was old and worn. Curtained windows afforded no glimpse of the interior.<br />\nThere was a doorway facing the street,<br />\nbut it was securely boarded up and padlocked. Further investigation revealed an<br />\nunobtrusive side entrance with a small<br />\nwindow, easily overlooked from the<br />\nstreet. This outward appearance might<br />\nwell have led one to believe that the building had fallen out of use, if not for the<br />\ntwo large posters in the windows. \u2022<br />\nThe Cellar Door<br />\nTON IGHT<br />\nLEON REDBONE\u2014CHRIS SMITIIER<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\ngreeted with a grunt of apProval.

This paper<br />\nwould supply all the information<br />\nconcerning bars and their prices, concerts,<br />\nand the location of all night diners in<br />\ntown. The name would be unmistakable:<br />\nThe Baltimore Hedonist.<br />\nWith the conviction that an outstanding cover story would solve my problems,<br />\nI attended the Second Annual End of the<br />\nWorld Show at the B DWAY(R,O,and A<br />\nare missing from the marquis). As I could<br />\ngather, this show would serve as a telethon for the demented Baltimore freak<br />\ncommunity. Perhaps if wasted enough,<br />\nthe audience could foretell what the last<br />\njudgement would be like, for this was a<br />\nvision of a stoned apocalypse. The emcee<br />\nwas wearing a softball jersey and had a<br />\nglib Jerry Lewis style of speaking. There<br />\nwas no phone calling or pledging of<br />\nmoney involved, but there was a countdown of sorts inaugurated by our host, as<br />\nhe reminded us after and before each<br />\ngroup played that .Miss Edith Massey, the<br />\nstar of Pink Flamingo would be on stage<br />\nat midnight. Apparently, this was one of<br />\nthe key reasons why so many had assembled for six hours of local talent.<br />\nFor those of you who have never<br />\nventured to the B DWAY, a few words<br />\nare in order. Located near the junction of<br />\nEastern Avenue and South Broadway,<br />\nthis once diapidated edifice remains<br />\ntoday. On the inside it looks like there<br />\nwas once a fire and flood at the same<br />\ntime. There are huge portholes of green<br />\nlight and decorated serpents on the wall<br />\npanels, whose color ranges from the pink<br />\nof a tongue burnt by funky smoking to<br />\nthe purple of a liver done in by booze.<br />\nSuch architecture has been recognized by<br />\nour society as a monument of an era<br />\nmore twisted than our own, and so it is<br />\npreserved to remind culture of the competition for The Most Wanton Epoch of<br />\nHistory. However, I could walk into this<br />\ntheatre with a six pack and the leftovers<br />\nof a quart of Black Label, so I can't complain.<br />\nThe first group to perform was RAZOR, an Alice-Cooper-esque group with<br />\n\"original\" material. The lead singer began<br />\nthe act by changing from a sleezy Palm<br /><br />\nOcean Rose in concert last October.' Halloween nights, etc.<br />\nBeach suit to a black see-thru dress. After<br />\nthe first song, instead of saying thank<br />\nyou, he replied, \"Lipstick on your<br />\ncrotch.\" Somewhat redundant was their<br />\nsong, \"The Girl with the Fuck-Me<br />\nShoes.\" RAZOR was a lousy act, so it<br />\nwas easy to get into some heavy drinking.<br />\nBodily abuse was in order and we needed<br />\nrefuelling, we skipped out to the local<br />\nbars.<br />\nB'DWAY<br />\nAfter a few drinks and a few toots, we<br />\nwandered to the Acropolis Bar for some<br />\nGreek food and balalaika music. When we<br />\nreturned to the B DWAY, three hours<br />\nlater, the crowd was fired up. Once the<br />\nChesapeake Retrievers began their intense<br />\nbluegrass, the aisles were filled with dancers. I remember one mondo in particular<br />\nwho looked like H.R. Haldeman's bastard<br />\nand who was moving his skinhead in time<br />\nwith the music like a chicken\u2014just another crazy country instrument I guess. After<br />\nthe Retrievers had finished, the crowd<br />\nwas buzzing as if returning from a long<br />\nday in a machine shop.<br />\nOcean Rose was next, and they were<br />\nthe only group not allowed 45 minutes<br />\nplaying time. They would only play six<br /><br />\ntunes (among them the memorable<br />\n\"Buccaneer\") as the emcee was hyped up<br />\non getting big Edith on stage. He didn't<br />\ncare that Ocean Rose was the best performance of the evening. (Thinking that a<br />\nbutane lighter on high flame would cause<br />\na round of lit matches, an encore, and<br />\nthreaten fire to the emcee, I thrust the<br />\nblowtorch into the air. The crowd did not<br />\nwant to ke9p the emcee in line nor Ocean<br />\nRose on stage, so there I stood, a statue<br />\nof liberty amidst a throng of foreigners.)<br />\nWith the arrival of the Edith Massey<br />\nentourage, the crowd went into a frenzy.<br />\nI soon had a haunting vision of the missing letters on the theatre marquis as the<br />\ncrowd chanted: \"Edith, E-dit, Eat it,<br />\nEdith.\" ROA. Edith's back up group began with a jazz arrangement that sounded<br />\nlike some of Freddie Hubbard's stuff\u2014the<br />\nhorn solo is still reverberating in my head.<br />\nWhen this was finished, two go-go<br />\ndancers, dressed like the cat women of<br />\nthe science fiction flick of the same<br />\nname, sang and danced to \"Sexy Ida.\"<br />\nThe crowd was really going, and I have<br />\nnever witnessed such deprivation Shouts<br />\nof Edith ROA continued, and then, as if<br />\nthe comet Kohoutek hit the stage, this<br /><br />\nbig mama burst into the theatre.<br />\nShe was disgusting\u2014some of her teeth<br />\nwere missing and she had huge red<br />\nsplotches of eyeshadow on her forehead.<br />\nI was getting sick from t he radiation her<br />\nred and silver-sequined sack threw off. She<br />\nsang and danced to a long rendition of<br />\n\"Let Me Entertain You.\" Every time she<br />\nrevealed her drumsticks to the lepers in<br />\nthe crowd went bullshit, and I was starting to get the dry heaves. Then from nowhere, two women dressed in Lou Reed<br />\ndrag madeit on to the stage, and punched<br />\nout the cat women. One of them had had<br />\nher pants unzipped all the while to reveal<br />\nher hindquarters, -and when she took off<br />\nher clothes, it came as no surprise.<br />\nYucch!<br />\nI don't know whether it was the<br />\nScotch or the beer, or the innumerable<br />\ntoots, but I was ill, and when this bony-S<br />\nassed stripper thrust her wrinkled tushy<br />\ninto our faces, I gagged and bolted down<br />\nthe aisle to the bathroom which was some<br />\nthirty steps underground.

My next thing, Calypso, will set a<br />\nnew direction. The entire record will be<br />\none track. down beat, July 18, 1974.<br />\nSince that interview, things have changed. Calypso becameCalypso Prelim\u00b0, an<br />\nexpression of support for the Mozambique Liberation Party, who opposed the<br />\nwhite rule of Mozambique. Duke<br /><br />\nEllington died. But the music is essentially<br />\nthe same.<br />\nFor the most part, the album lives up<br />\nto its expected value. It is a new direction, for Miles and for us, but it builds off<br />\nof the old. The last several albums Miles<br />\nhas done were very concerned with colour and texture, much like the music of<br />\nKarlheinz Stockhausen. In Get Up With<br />\nIt, Miles is just as colour oriented, but he<br />\nhas turned somewhat more lyrical, as he<br />\nwas in the late fifties and sixties, and the<br />\nCarribean rhythmic influence is unmistakable. The band, too, has changed:<br />\nMiles used to use as many as four keyboard and one guitar, and here- uses two<br />\nor three guitars and only occassional keyboard (which he himself provides).<br />\nThe result is effective; this is one of the<br />\nbest bancls that Miles has ever had.<br />\nMichael Henderson on bass provides the<br />\nfoundation for the rhythmic and harmonic embellishments of Mtume,congas,<br />\nand Reggie Lucas, guitar. Sonny Fortune's sax is most notably effective on<br />\nMaiysha, and Davis himself uses an 'economy of notes to create his effect.<br />\nI do have one complaint, though, and<br />\nit not the music. It's Columbia records.<br /><br />\nTwo cuts on the album are totally different from all the others. One is Red China<br />\nBlues, a short, straight funky blues that<br />\nseems tailor made for airplay. It's a good<br />\ntune, but it seems to be an obvious ploy<br />\nfor sales.<br />\nHowever, Honky Tonk is not. Honky<br />\nTonk is a moderately interesting cut that<br />\nwas recorded in 1970. A small section of<br />\nit was used as a bridge from a studio session to a live session in Sivad from the<br />\nLive-Evil album. It's recycled Miles, and<br />\nfrankly I'd rather hear new Miles.<br />\nSo why is it on the album? A quote<br />\nfrom Columbia ad for the album explains<br />\nthat \"All along, musicians like John<br />\nMclaughlin, Billy Cobham, Herbie<br />\nHancock and Keith Jarrett are performing with urgency and brilliance.\" Bullshit.<br />\nTheir urgency and brilliance\" lasts exactly 5'54\". Why is Columbia trying to hype<br />\nthe public? The same reason as always:<br />\ncorporate greed. Miles' new band has no<br />\neasily recognizable \"names\" in it, So the<br />\npeople at Columbia thought they'd pad<br />\nthe ad. And for what it's worth, last time<br />\nI checked, Get Up Witlz It was on it's way<br />\ninto Billboard's top 100 albums like a<br />\nbullet.<br /><br />\npage 12/news-letter/february 7, 1975<br /><br />\nMidshipmen dunk Hopkins hoopsters<br />\nBY STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nThe Midshipmen of the Naval<br />\nAcademy proved to be less than<br />\ngracious hosts on Wednesday<br />\nwhen they blew the Hopkins<br />\nbasketball team out of Halsey<br />\nField House, 82-53.<br />\nThis game marked the second<br />\nconsecutive contest in which the<br />\nBlue Jays ventured, unsuccessfully, into Division 1, losing first to<br />\nDrexel and coupled with the defeat at Annapolis, dropped the<br />\nJays season record to 6-9.<br />\nSurprisingly, considering the<br />\nscore, the game was a closely contested battle for three-quarters<br />\nof the game. To defend against<br />\nNavy's 6'8\", 6'7\" frontline,<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert installed a<br />\n1-3-1 zone defense to provide<br />\nHopkins with better rebounding<br />\nand for most of the game, the<br />\nstrategy proved successful.<br />\nNavy jumped to a 22-11 lead<br />\nin the first half but the Jays came<br />\nback to cut the deficit to 22-19,<br />\nholding the Middies scoreless for<br />\na six minute span. The first half<br />\nended with the Jays still very<br />\nmuch in the game, trailing 26-21.<br />\n\"We successfully employed<br />\nour strategy, that was to control<br />\nthe tempo and make Navy play<br />\nour game,\" said Coach Rupert.<br />\n\"We limited their fast break and<br />\nsuccessfully held our own off the<br />\nboards.\" The sailors had only one<br />\nmore rebound than the Jays in<br />\nthe first half. \"We did everything<br />\nright in the first half,\" Rupert<br />\ncontinued, \"except put the ball<br />\nin the hoop.\" Statistics bear out<br />\nthat fact; Hopkins connected on<br />\nonly 22% of its shots in the opening stanza.<br />\n\"Both teams played a horrendous first half,\" agreed Navy<br />\nCoach Dave Smalley. \"Our shooting was atrocious. We just<br />\ncouldn't seem to do anything<br />\nright.\"<br />\nThe game remained close<br />\nthrough the first eight minutes of<br />\nthe second half as well. However<br />\nat that point all hell broke loose.<br />\nAhead by three, the Midshipmen<br />\napplied a full-court man-to-man<br />\ntrapping press and the<br />\nHomewood quintet lost its composure and the ballgame.<br />\nThe Middies' forced the Jays<br />\ninto numerous turnovers and<br />\ncontinually converted layups after steals in the backcourt. Navy<br />\nbuilt up a thirty point lead with<br />\nfour minutes left in the game<br />\nwhen both coaches proceeded to<br />\nclear their benches. The teams<br />\ntraded baskets the rest of the<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"The same thing happened this<br />\ntime as has happened the past<br />\nfour times we,'ve played them,\"<br /><br />\nsaid Rupert. \"We stay in the first<br />\nthree-quarters of the game and<br />\nthen they blow us out. We may<br />\nhave been nervous, playing in big<br />\n-time surroundings for the first<br />\ntime this season, but we were<br />\nprepared for the game. We knew<br />\nthey had an excellent press with<br />\nquick, physical guards. They<br />\ndidn't surprise us, but our ballhandlers just couldn't handle it.\"<br />\nThe Midshipmen forced the<br />\nblue Jays into 42 turnovers while<br />\nturning the ball over only 19<br />\ntimes themselves.<br />\nNeither side put on a sparkling<br />\nshooting exhibition. Hopkins<br />\nconnected on 34% of its' field<br />\ngoal attempts while the Middies<br />\nhit 39%. The Jays regained their<br /><br />\ntouch from the foul line (which<br />\nthey'd lost against Drexel) connecting on 76% of their charity<br />\ntosses (19-25).

For the first time ever,<br />\nthey had ventured into the Midwest, facing fencing powerhouses<br />\nlike Ohio State, Wayne State, and<br />\nNotre Dame. This wild trip, in<br />\nwhich they faced 16 schools in<br />\nhalf as many days, was based in<br />\nlarge measure to their last monumental season which climaxed<br />\nwith a first in the MAC's, a second in the NAC's and a finish of<br />\n10th in the NCAA championships.<br />\nError<br />\nAn early blow shocked the<br />\nteam, however, since their star<br />\nfoilman, Bob Baum, did not return this season. This is what, to<br />\na large measure, caused the<br />\nteam's early falterings with losses<br />\nin their first three out of four<br />\nmeets, explained co-captain John<br />\nRoberts.
