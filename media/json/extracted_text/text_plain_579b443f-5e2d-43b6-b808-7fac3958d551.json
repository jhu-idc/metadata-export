At the<br />\nsame time, enrollments in the<br />\nhumanities are declining and<br />\nenrollments in the social sciences<br />\nare leveling off.<br />\nData supplied by Hopkins<br />\nRegistrar Robert Cyphers show<br />\nthat the trend away from the<br />\nstudy of the humanities and<br />\nsocial sciences toward the study<br />\nof natural and engineering<br />\nscience is evident to some degree<br />\nhere. A comparison of Arts and<br />\nSciences fall term undergraduate<br />\nmajors at Hopkins for 1969-1973<br />\nshows a definite similarity to the<br />\ntrend of undergraduate majors at<br />\nthe national level.<br />\nIn the natural sciences, the<br />\npercentage of undergraduate<br />\nmajors has risen from 35.8<br />\npercent of all Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates in the fall of<br />\n1969 to 48.9 percent in the fall<br />\nof 1973. Meanwhile, majors in<br />\nthe humanities have fallen from<br />\n16.5 percent to 9.8 percent and<br />\nin the social sciences from 28.3<br />\n<br />\npercent to 27.7 percent after<br />\nreaching a high of 29.2 percent in<br />\nthe fall of 1971.<br />\nHopkins' undergraduates<br />\nmajoring in engineering science<br />\nalso fell from 13.1 percent in the<br />\nfall of 1969 to 5.7 percent in the<br />\nfall of 1972 before rising slightly<br />\nto 6.0 percent in 1973.<br />\nThat the choice of majors of<br />\nthis year's freshman class at<br />\nHopkins not only runs opposite<br />\nto the national trend but also to<br />\nthe school-wide trend reflects the<br />\nrecent decision of the<br />\nadministartion to seek a more<br />\ndiverse student body with regard<br />\nto undergraduate majors.<br />\nConsequently, the number of<br />\nfreshmen natural science majors<br />\nactually dropped at Hopkins<br />\nbetween 1972 and 1973 from<br />\n61.7 percent to 53.7 percent. In<br />\naddition, freshmen humanities<br />\nmajors rose from 5.4 percent in<br />\n1972 to 8.6 percent in 1973 and<br />\nsocial and behavioral sciences<br />\nmajors from 18.9 percent in<br />\n1972 to 21.9 percent in 1973.<br />\nAlso, freshmen majoring in<br />\nengineering science increased<br />\nfrom 4.3 percent in 1972 to 5.9<br />\npercent in 1973.<br />\nThe article in The Chronicle<br />\nreports that students are<br />\napparently \"abandoning<br />\n<br />\ntheoretical, abstract, and purely<br />\nacademic fields for those that<br />\nrelate directly to jobs.\"<br />\nCommenting on this situation,<br />\nStanford University President<br />\nRichard W. Lyman said, \"A few<br />\nyears ago we seemed greatly<br />\nover-supplied with amateur<br />\nrhetoricians and street-corner<br />\nmoralists. Now there seems a<br />\ndanger of our becoming once<br />\nagain over supplied with<br />\ncareerists and technocrats of one<br />\nkind or another.\"<br />\n<br />\nsee REGISTRAR, page 7<br />\n<br />\nRobert Cyphers<br />\n<br />\n$1,580,000 on the basis of its<br />\napproximately 6,500 full time<br />\nequivalent students. The number<br />\nof full time equivalents is<br />\ndetermined by the number of<br />\ncredit hours a student is taking,<br />\nnot the number of students<br />\nenrolled full time. Thus, Hopkins<br />\nstands to gain considerably from<br />\nits large enrollment of part time<br />\nstudents in the Evening College.<br />\nSince Hopkins received<br />\n$941,000 last year under the old<br />\nformula and would receive only<br />\n$890,000 under the first phase of<br />\nthe new system, a supplemental<br />\nappropriation of $50,000 is to be<br />\nsought to make up the<br />\ndifference. The funds for the first<br />\nphase are contained in the<br />\nGovernor's proposed budget,<br />\nwhich was submitted to the<br />\nGeneral Assembly last month.<br />\nAccording to Woodworth,<br />\nHopkins officials have been<br />\nurging the Governor's office to<br />\nincrease the supplemental budget<br />\nrequest to $262,000, in order to<br />\nmake up for the funding shortfall<br />\nthat reduced the amount of<br />\nmoney Hopkins received last year<br />\nunder the old formula.<br />\n<br />\nPIIAC fails to reach<br />\ndecision on Rx firm<br />\n<br />\nyou a little more money to work<br />\nwith?

Many manufacturing firms operate<br />\nwithout any concern for the amount of pollution they may<br />\ncreate. Many businesses go on for years without giving any<br />\nthought to their hiring practices.<br />\nNon-commercial institutions, such as universities, often<br />\noperate without giving any thought to the burden their<br />\ntax-free status imposes on the city in which they are, or on<br />\nthe citizens who live there. Certainly, for many years,<br />\nHopkins has been no exception to this rule. While it is true<br />\nthat the University has maintained a decent record of keeping its campus open to outsiders and that President Muller<br />\nexercised a commendable restraint last year in refusing to<br />\nwall off the campus, when concern over crime was at its<br />\npeak, Hopkins has really done very little to aid the declining neighborhod in which it stands.<br />\nSo the announcement last week of a program under<br />\nwhich Hopkins will deposit some of its money in local<br />\nbanks that agree to make mortgage loans to area residents<br />\nappears to be a step in the right direction. That the initial<br />\ndeposit is only S30,000 in one bank should not be viewed<br />\naskance; the crucial issue for the future is whether or not<br />\nHopkins goes beyond the Waverly Savings and Loan and deposits some of its money in other local banks which agree<br />\nto make mortgage deals. Equally as important is the way in<br />\nwhich Hopkins handles its ongoing relations with residents<br />\nof the surrounding community.

Bober<br />\nAED President<br />\n<br />\nIntersession<br />\nit seems to fll that several<br />\nimportant points are being<br />\noverlooked in the current debate<br />\nover intersession. Firstly, at<br />\npresent, we pay the university<br />\n$3000 for 162 days of class time,<br />\nincluding exam periods and<br />\nintersession. This works out to<br />\n$18.52 per day. Thus, if the<br />\nUniversity decides t o eliminate<br />\nintersession, without scheduling<br />\nthe extra days elswehere, the<br />\nstudents should be given a $269.28<br />\nreduction in their tuition bills. This<br />\ndoes not take into account room,<br />\nboard, and other miscellaneous<br />\nfees. If I were planning a vacation<br />\nin January, $269.28 would be a<br />\nvery nice budget with which to<br />\nwork.<br />\nSecondly, some faculty<br />\nmembers seem to think that credits<br />\neamed during intersession require<br />\nless classtime per credit than those<br />\nearned during the regular<br />\nsemesters. A look at some figures<br />\nwill show that this is not usually<br />\ntrue. \"Psychopathology of<br />\nChildhood,\" offered during<br />\nintersession, required five hours of<br />\nclass attendence per week for one<br />\ncredit. Thus, a total of fourteen<br />\nhours was required to earn that<br />\ncredit. \"American Parties and<br />\nPolitics,\" on the other hand, meets<br />\n/<br />\n2 hours per week, during each<br />\nfor 11<br />\nsemester, for three credits. This<br />\nboils down to 22.5 hours per<br />\nsemester, or roughly 7.2 hours per<br />\ncredit \u2014 half the time required for<br />\nthe intersession course. Most<br />\n<br />\nregular classes meet three times per<br />\nweek and yield a credit for only<br />\n14 hours of classtirne, whereas<br />\n11/<br />\nmost intersession courses net for<br />\nfour hours per week and thus<br />\nrequired twelve hours of time per<br />\ncredit.<br />\nLastly, it seems strange that Dr.<br />\nSampson should complain that<br />\nstudents could take \"fly-by-night\"<br />\ncourses for easy credits. That such<br />\n\"easy\" courses are offered is not<br />\n<br />\n-k<br />\n<br />\ncourses.<br />\n<br />\n--<br />\n<br />\nguitar throughout a wearying and<br />\n<br />\nThus it seems that what is<br />\nneccesary to improve intersession<br />\nis more and better course offerings<br />\nby the University. In this way,<br />\nmore students could take<br />\nadvantage of a program allowing<br />\nthem to earn credits for rewarding<br />\nwork in fields otherwise<br />\nunavailable. The solution does not<br />\ntie in the direction of reducing or<br />\neliminating credit just because the<br />\nUniversity happens to offer<br />\nshallow or asinine courses. Nor<br />\nwould it be fair to cancel<br />\nintersession altogether, unless the<br />\naforementioned tuition decrease is<br />\nalso granted.<br />\nTed Cochran<br />\n<br />\nA Clarification<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI'd just like to clarify something<br />\nthat came out a little garbled in<br />\nlast week's News-Letter.

John Patzschke<br />\nand Tom Stenovec finished 1-2 in<br />\nthe 1000 yd. freestyle and Eric<br />\nEngelmann and Jim Finnerty<br />\ntopped the field in the 200 yd.<br />\n-free.<br />\nOther 1-2 finishes included Bill<br />\nMilne and Bob Schwenkler in the<br />\n50 'yd. free; Fred Rudolph and<br />\nDon Remaly in the 200 yd.<br />\nindividual medley; Stoever and<br />\nRudolph in the 200 yd. butterfly<br />\nand Tom Coley and Jeff Cool in<br />\nthe 200 yd. breaststroke, among<br />\nothers in the romp. The Jays also<br />\nboasted a pair of double winners<br />\nwith Milne capturing both the 50<br />\nand 100 yd. freestyles while Marc<br />\nToliir won both the 1 and 3<br />\nmeter diving competition.<br />\nThis sets the stage for the most<br />\nimportant dual meet for Hopkins<br />\nswimming since January, 1969<br />\nwhen the Jays upset the<br />\nUniversity of Delaware in Coach<br />\nComfort's first season here at<br />\nHomewood.

S.I.T. took two of the next<br />\nthree sabre bouts, but the rally<br />\nfizzled as the foil and epee teams<br />\ncombined for five wins, raising<br />\nthe JHU margin to 13-5. The foil<br />\nteam was especially dominant in<br />\nthe middle round, outscoring their<br />\ncounterparts 15-3. All this set the<br />\nstage for Bruce Livingston to win<br />\nthe fourteenth bout 5-0, running<br />\nhis three-year winning streak over<br />\nStevens to nine straight.<br />\nJunior co-captain Glenn Pantel<br />\nmade it eight foil victories in a<br />\nrow, going 3-0, as did foilman<br />\nRobert Baum, who finally<br />\n<br />\nreturned to good form. Senior<br />\nMark Davis won three epee<br />\nbouts, maintaining the<br />\nconsistency he and the rest of the<br />\nepee team have shown since the<br />\nintersession trip. The above four<br />\nfencers along with the other<br />\no-captain John Roberts have<br />\ncompiled the top five records on<br />\nthe team yet are separated by<br />\n<br />\nonly two losses. It is this kind of<br />\nbalance that the Hopkins fencing<br />\nteam has used to win five straight<br />\ndual meets since the Army<br />\ndebacle. The entire team and<br />\ncoach Dick Oles expect to finish<br />\nout the season with three more<br />\nwins, and continue on to win the<br />\nMAC crown and possibly the<br />\nNCAA title.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Roberts (r.) vs. Stevens Institute of Technology.<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS<br />\nA senior this\u00a7 meeting will be held Wednesday, February<br />\n13 at 5 p.m. in the Garrett Room.

At the<br />\nsame time, enrollments in the<br />\nhumanities are declining and<br />\nenrollments in the social sciences<br />\nare leveling off.<br />\nData supplied by Hopkins<br />\nRegistrar Robert Cyphers show<br />\nthat the trend away from the<br />\nstudy of the humanities and<br />\nsocial sciences toward the study<br />\nof natural and engineering<br />\nscience is evident to some degree<br />\nhere. A comparison of Arts and<br />\nSciences fall term undergraduate<br />\nmajors at Hopkins for 1969-1973<br />\nshows a definite similarity to the<br />\ntrend of undergraduate majors at<br />\nthe national level.<br />\nIn the natural sciences, the<br />\npercentage of undergraduate<br />\nmajors has risen from 35.8<br />\npercent of all Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates in the fall of<br />\n1969 to 48.9 percent in the fall<br />\nof 1973. Meanwhile, majors in<br />\nthe humanities have fallen from<br />\n16.5 percent to 9.8 percent and<br />\nin the social sciences from 28.3<br /><br />\npercent to 27.7 percent after<br />\nreaching a high of 29.2 percent in<br />\nthe fall of 1971.<br />\nHopkins' undergraduates<br />\nmajoring in engineering science<br />\nalso fell from 13.1 percent in the<br />\nfall of 1969 to 5.7 percent in the<br />\nfall of 1972 before rising slightly<br />\nto 6.0 percent in 1973.<br />\nThat the choice of majors of<br />\nthis year's freshman class at<br />\nHopkins not only runs opposite<br />\nto the national trend but also to<br />\nthe school-wide trend reflects the<br />\nrecent decision of the<br />\nadministartion to seek a more<br />\ndiverse student body with regard<br />\nto undergraduate majors.<br />\nConsequently, the number of<br />\nfreshmen natural science majors<br />\nactually dropped at Hopkins<br />\nbetween 1972 and 1973 from<br />\n61.7 percent to 53.7 percent. In<br />\naddition, freshmen humanities<br />\nmajors rose from 5.4 percent in<br />\n1972 to 8.6 percent in 1973 and<br />\nsocial and behavioral sciences<br />\nmajors from 18.9 percent in<br />\n1972 to 21.9 percent in 1973.<br />\nAlso, freshmen majoring in<br />\nengineering science increased<br />\nfrom 4.3 percent in 1972 to 5.9<br />\npercent in 1973.<br />\nThe article in The Chronicle<br />\nreports that students are<br />\napparently \"abandoning<br /><br />\ntheoretical, abstract, and purely<br />\nacademic fields for those that<br />\nrelate directly to jobs.\"<br />\nCommenting on this situation,<br />\nStanford University President<br />\nRichard W. Lyman said, \"A few<br />\nyears ago we seemed greatly<br />\nover-supplied with amateur<br />\nrhetoricians and street-corner<br />\nmoralists. Now there seems a<br />\ndanger of our becoming once<br />\nagain over supplied with<br />\ncareerists and technocrats of one<br />\nkind or another.\"<br /><br />\nsee REGISTRAR, page 7<br /><br />\nRobert Cyphers<br /><br />\n$1,580,000 on the basis of its<br />\napproximately 6,500 full time<br />\nequivalent students. The number<br />\nof full time equivalents is<br />\ndetermined by the number of<br />\ncredit hours a student is taking,<br />\nnot the number of students<br />\nenrolled full time. Thus, Hopkins<br />\nstands to gain considerably from<br />\nits large enrollment of part time<br />\nstudents in the Evening College.<br />\nSince Hopkins received<br />\n$941,000 last year under the old<br />\nformula and would receive only<br />\n$890,000 under the first phase of<br />\nthe new system, a supplemental<br />\nappropriation of $50,000 is to be<br />\nsought to make up the<br />\ndifference. The funds for the first<br />\nphase are contained in the<br />\nGovernor's proposed budget,<br />\nwhich was submitted to the<br />\nGeneral Assembly last month.<br />\nAccording to Woodworth,<br />\nHopkins officials have been<br />\nurging the Governor's office to<br />\nincrease the supplemental budget<br />\nrequest to $262,000, in order to<br />\nmake up for the funding shortfall<br />\nthat reduced the amount of<br />\nmoney Hopkins received last year<br />\nunder the old formula.<br /><br />\nPIIAC fails to reach<br />\ndecision on Rx firm<br /><br />\nyou a little more money to work<br />\nwith?

Many manufacturing firms operate<br />\nwithout any concern for the amount of pollution they may<br />\ncreate. Many businesses go on for years without giving any<br />\nthought to their hiring practices.<br />\nNon-commercial institutions, such as universities, often<br />\noperate without giving any thought to the burden their<br />\ntax-free status imposes on the city in which they are, or on<br />\nthe citizens who live there. Certainly, for many years,<br />\nHopkins has been no exception to this rule. While it is true<br />\nthat the University has maintained a decent record of keeping its campus open to outsiders and that President Muller<br />\nexercised a commendable restraint last year in refusing to<br />\nwall off the campus, when concern over crime was at its<br />\npeak, Hopkins has really done very little to aid the declining neighborhod in which it stands.<br />\nSo the announcement last week of a program under<br />\nwhich Hopkins will deposit some of its money in local<br />\nbanks that agree to make mortgage loans to area residents<br />\nappears to be a step in the right direction. That the initial<br />\ndeposit is only S30,000 in one bank should not be viewed<br />\naskance; the crucial issue for the future is whether or not<br />\nHopkins goes beyond the Waverly Savings and Loan and deposits some of its money in other local banks which agree<br />\nto make mortgage deals.

Bober<br />\nAED President<br /><br />\nIntersession<br />\nit seems to fll that several<br />\nimportant points are being<br />\noverlooked in the current debate<br />\nover intersession. Firstly, at<br />\npresent, we pay the university<br />\n$3000 for 162 days of class time,<br />\nincluding exam periods and<br />\nintersession. This works out to<br />\n$18.52 per day. Thus, if the<br />\nUniversity decides t o eliminate<br />\nintersession, without scheduling<br />\nthe extra days elswehere, the<br />\nstudents should be given a $269.28<br />\nreduction in their tuition bills. This<br />\ndoes not take into account room,<br />\nboard, and other miscellaneous<br />\nfees. If I were planning a vacation<br />\nin January, $269.28 would be a<br />\nvery nice budget with which to<br />\nwork.<br />\nSecondly, some faculty<br />\nmembers seem to think that credits<br />\neamed during intersession require<br />\nless classtime per credit than those<br />\nearned during the regular<br />\nsemesters. A look at some figures<br />\nwill show that this is not usually<br />\ntrue. \"Psychopathology of<br />\nChildhood,\" offered during<br />\nintersession, required five hours of<br />\nclass attendence per week for one<br />\ncredit. Thus, a total of fourteen<br />\nhours was required to earn that<br />\ncredit. \"American Parties and<br />\nPolitics,\" on the other hand, meets<br />\n/<br />\n2 hours per week, during each<br />\nfor 11<br />\nsemester, for three credits. This<br />\nboils down to 22.5 hours per<br />\nsemester, or roughly 7.2 hours per<br />\ncredit \u2014 half the time required for<br />\nthe intersession course. Most<br /><br />\nregular classes meet three times per<br />\nweek and yield a credit for only<br />\n14 hours of classtirne, whereas<br />\n11/<br />\nmost intersession courses net for<br />\nfour hours per week and thus<br />\nrequired twelve hours of time per<br />\ncredit.<br />\nLastly, it seems strange that Dr.<br />\nSampson should complain that<br />\nstudents could take \"fly-by-night\"<br />\ncourses for easy credits. That such<br />\n\"easy\" courses are offered is not<br /><br />\n-k<br /><br />\ncourses.<br /><br />\n--<br /><br />\nguitar throughout a wearying and<br /><br />\nThus it seems that what is<br />\nneccesary to improve intersession<br />\nis more and better course offerings<br />\nby the University. In this way,<br />\nmore students could take<br />\nadvantage of a program allowing<br />\nthem to earn credits for rewarding<br />\nwork in fields otherwise<br />\nunavailable. The solution does not<br />\ntie in the direction of reducing or<br />\neliminating credit just because the<br />\nUniversity happens to offer<br />\nshallow or asinine courses. Nor<br />\nwould it be fair to cancel<br />\nintersession altogether, unless the<br />\naforementioned tuition decrease is<br />\nalso granted.<br />\nTed Cochran<br /><br />\nA Clarification<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI'd just like to clarify something<br />\nthat came out a little garbled in<br />\nlast week's News-Letter.

The Jays also<br />\nboasted a pair of double winners<br />\nwith Milne capturing both the 50<br />\nand 100 yd. freestyles while Marc<br />\nToliir won both the 1 and 3<br />\nmeter diving competition.<br />\nThis sets the stage for the most<br />\nimportant dual meet for Hopkins<br />\nswimming since January, 1969<br />\nwhen the Jays upset the<br />\nUniversity of Delaware in Coach<br />\nComfort's first season here at<br />\nHomewood. The meet will take<br />\nplace on Wednesday night against<br /><br />\nGreg DeLong jumps high above opponents' heads for defensive rebound.<br /><br />\nthe University of Maryland at<br />\n8:00 in Homewood Pool.<br />\nTwerps<br />\nWhen comparing the two<br />\nsquads, one immediately notices<br />\nthat whereas the Jays lost to<br />\nNavy 61-52, the Terps defeated<br />\nthe Midshipmen 65-48. When<br />\nasked about this,, Coach Comfort<br />\nsaid, \"Due to personnel<br />\nmatchups, even though Maryland<br />\nis a better team than Navy, we<br />\nhave a better chance to beat the<br />\nTerrapins.\"<br /><br />\nthe gasoline shortage might<br />\nstrand the team in New Jersey,<br />\nthe Jays relaxed sufficiently to<br />\nout fence a Stevens team<br />\nweakened considerablyby the<br />\nravages of academia.<br />\nGood fencing and good<br />\ndirecting in the first round<br />\nenabled Hopkins to take<br />\ncommand of the match early,<br />\n7-2. S.I.T. took two of the next<br />\nthree sabre bouts, but the rally<br />\nfizzled as the foil and epee teams<br />\ncombined for five wins, raising<br />\nthe JHU margin to 13-5. The foil<br />\nteam was especially dominant in<br />\nthe middle round, outscoring their<br />\ncounterparts 15-3. All this set the<br />\nstage for Bruce Livingston to win<br />\nthe fourteenth bout 5-0, running<br />\nhis three-year winning streak over<br />\nStevens to nine straight.<br />\nJunior co-captain Glenn Pantel<br />\nmade it eight foil victories in a<br />\nrow, going 3-0, as did foilman<br />\nRobert Baum, who finally<br /><br />\nreturned to good form. Senior<br />\nMark Davis won three epee<br />\nbouts, maintaining the<br />\nconsistency he and the rest of the<br />\nepee team have shown since the<br />\nintersession trip. The above four<br />\nfencers along with the other<br />\no-captain John Roberts have<br />\ncompiled the top five records on<br />\nthe team yet are separated by<br /><br />\nonly two losses. It is this kind of<br />\nbalance that the Hopkins fencing<br />\nteam has used to win five straight<br />\ndual meets since the Army<br />\ndebacle. The entire team and<br />\ncoach Dick Oles expect to finish<br />\nout the season with three more<br />\nwins, and continue on to win the<br />\nMAC crown and possibly the<br />\nNCAA title.<br /><br />\nJohn Roberts (r.) vs. Stevens Institute of Technology.<br /><br />\nSENIORS<br />\nA senior this\u00a7 meeting will be held Wednesday, February<br />\n13 at 5 p.m. in the Garrett Room.
