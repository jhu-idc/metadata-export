Otherwise, the individual is<br />\nin danger of missing some of the main points<br />\nin life, such as self-knowledge, self-control,<br />\nand due regard for his neighbors. Failing to<br />\ndiscover one's own capabilities and to master<br />\none's self at school or college, the student finds<br />\nthat he has wasted some oil the best years of<br />\nlife, when by closer contact with a more exacting business world he might at least have been<br />\nacquiring more sense and some practical knowledge or useful trade.<br />\nIn every school and college course there are<br />\ncertain objects that are especially worthy of<br />\nachievement, and without them all other educational acquirements are of little account. Of<br />\nwhat use is it to know specialties, or things in<br />\nparticular, and to be a fool in general ? Not<br />\nall the personal culture of which a selfish man<br />\nis capable is worth the common sense and plain<br />\nmorality of a good citizen. \" Knowledge for<br />\nman's self,\" said Lord Bacon, \"is in many<br />\nbranches thereof a depraved thing.\" The<br />\nGreeks called that man an idiot Kuorvo who<br />\nhad no active interest or useful part in civic society. So is he who does not voluntarily conform to the established social order. The first<br />\nduty of all education is to acquire civic sense, a<br />\nspirit of obedience to law and authority. This<br />\nspirit is the primary virtue of every good citizen. It is the law-abiding spirit in contradistinction to lawlessness and anarchy. Order is<br />\nthe proper basis of every school and college, as<br />\nof every civic and social assembly. A student<br />\nwho will not restrain himself in the class room,<br />\nor who disturbs others on college premises, deserves to be repressed or put out of the pre-<br />\n<br />\nNo. 17<br />\n<br />\ncincts of learning. And yet many boys and<br />\nyoung men seem to think that school is the<br />\nplace .for mischief and college a fair field for<br />\nhorse play and breaking the public peace. The<br />\nrecent outbreaks of rioting and disorder in<br />\nacademic towns illustrate the survival in America of the antinquated notion that students are<br />\na law unto themselves, and that the rights of<br />\nother people have no existence in a college<br />\ncommunity or under the common law. The<br />\niea of the antiquated notion that students are<br />\napparently still in fashion in American colleges.<br />\nFortunately, Baltimore is a city with a welldeveloped public sense in favor of good government. There is little opportunity or disposition on the part of the student population of<br />\nour 2,000 men in this University Town to<br />\nbreak the local peace. Occasionally, in theatres<br />\nor other public places there have been feeble<br />\nattempts to disturb the performance and interfere with the rights of others, but such attempts have always been promptly checked by<br />\ncivic common sense, if not by the police. in<br />\nBaltimore public opinion clearly recognizes<br />\nthat student pranks and misdemeanors do not<br />\nAny old-time<br />\nbefit a civilized community.<br />\nsympathizer with college disorder, on the<br />\nground that this is a display of true college<br />\nspirit, is a foe of higher education and good citizenship. Sooner or later, even in our country<br />\ncolleges, boys must learn by severe treatment<br />\nthat they, too, are under law and that their first<br />\nduty is to obey it. The mere fact that there<br />\nstill survives in some institutions an avowed<br />\nsympathy with antiquated, barbaric customs<br />\nproves conclusively that the modern civic sense<br />\nhas not yet fully evolved and has not triumphed<br />\nover medimval nonsense. Where that savage<br />\nspirit of student lawlessness still prevails, there<br />\nthe primary object of higher education in civic<br />\nsociety has not been accomplished.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nOur American schools and colleges sometimes break ,down at the most critical point,<br />\nnamely, in respect for common law, constituted<br />\nauthority, and the rights of property on which<br />\nall good government and civilization rest. A<br />\nprofessed scholar who is not at the same time a<br />\ndecent and orderly citizen is an anomalous<br />\nbeing. He is an uncivil, uneducated clown.<br />\nEdmund Burke said: \" Men cannot enjoy the<br />\nrights of an uncivil and civil state together.\"<br />\nIt is not often in this academic community<br />\nthat students break the peace by noisy demonstrations,. What such things will inevitably<br />\nlead to, if encouraged, is indicated in the Public Ledger of Philadelphia for Saturday, May<br />\n27, 1899, which records the fact that, on the<br />\npreceding day, college students of the University of Pennsylvania started out, after chapel<br />\nexercises, to celebrate the conclusion of lectures for the academic year just closing. About<br />\n400 juniors, sophomores, and freshmen formed<br />\nin lines of fours and paraded about the campus<br />\nand through the principal buildings singing<br />\ncollege songs and at intervals giving the familiar yells. The more prominent of the professors were visted in their lecture rooms and<br />\ncalled upon for speeches. The celebration was<br />\ncontinued by the students marching along some<br />\nof the public streets, stealing signboards and<br />\nlooting an ice wagon ! One of the rioters was<br />\nstruck in the ribs by an ice hatchet and severely<br />\nwounded. Four students were caught by the<br />\npolice and taken to the station-house. They<br />\nwere charged with breach of the peace, and<br />\neach offender was held for trial on $400 bail.<br />\nThese contemporary facts may be thought<br />\nfunny and characteristic of college life, but they<br />\nare quite unworthy of liberal education, as are<br />\nsome other well-known abuses of student freedom still tolerated in academic institutions. It<br />\nsometimes seems that school and college culture is not even skin deep. For example, when<br />\ncollegians this very spring painted red the<br />\nstatue of John Harvard, or, some years ago,<br />\nbranded with fire candidates for initiation to<br />\na college fraternity. If the enlightened sentiment of faculties and upperclassmen do not<br />\nsoon suppress student savagery and rowdyism<br />\nof all sorts, the police courts probably will.<br />\n<br />\nIn these democratic days, when even American children are becoming pert and freshmen<br />\nregardless of their elders, it is time to revive<br />\nand cultivate the principle embodied in that<br />\nsaying of William of Wykeman, Bishop of<br />\nWinchester, who founded a collegiate school in<br />\nthat cathedral town and also New College at<br />\nThat<br />\nOxford: \"Manners maketh man.\"<br />\ncharacterizes<br />\nstill<br />\nmotto of Winchester School<br />\nthe students of England. When Dr. Thomas<br />\nArnold, the modern reformer of Rugby and<br />\nindirectly of many other public schools, defined the qualifications of a good teacher, he<br />\nWhat I want is a man who is a Chrissaid:<br />\ntian and a gentleman\u2014an active man, and one<br />\nwho has common sense and understands boys.<br />\nI do not so much care about scholarship. as he<br />\nwill have immediately under him the lowest<br />\nforms in the school; but yet, on second<br />\nthoughts, I do not care about it very much,<br />\nbecause his pupils may be in the highest forms,<br />\nand, besides, I think that even the elements are<br />\nbest taught by a man who has a thorough<br />\nknowledge of the matter. However, if one<br />\nmust give way, I prefer activity of mind, and<br />\nan interest in his work, to high scholarship, for<br />\nthe one can be acquired more easily than the<br />\nother.\"<br />\nAt Rugby, as all school boys know, the<br />\n.inethod of government is by the good example<br />\nof masters and the older boys, the so-called<br />\n\" sixth form.\" The influence of seniority was<br />\nstrongly felt at Phillips Exeter Academy in my<br />\nschool days, when uppper class athletes ruled<br />\nthe lower classes, and when appointed senior<br />\nleaders sat together on a high bench at prayers<br />\nand when eery class room was firmly governed, even in the teacher's absence, by a socalled \" monitor,\" who was chosen by authority because of his eminent qualities as a man<br />\nand as a scholar. Boys always educate one<br />\nanother in school and out. Gladstone said he<br />\nlearned more in a student debating society at<br />\nEton than from his masters. England's statesmen are trained on the cricket field and on the<br />\nriver. Boys in a boat and in all athletic training obey their \"coach \" and captain as absolutely as soldiers obey orders, and this is right.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nAmong all the personal influences proceeding from native ability, athletic skill, classical<br />\nculture, literary talent, and mathematical genius, nothing is more important than acknowledged \" good form\" in everything that is said<br />\nor done. Some boys possess this quality by<br />\nnature or acquire it almost- instinctively by association, but some never learn how to do<br />\nthings or say things properly. Rude and uncouth from the very beginning of school or college life, they remain so throughout their enlire course and in after life are still lamentably<br />\ndeficient. Some boys have only a kind of superficial polish with no real substance of knowledge or character. They seem to have only the<br />\nexternal forms of politeness on certain occasions, but no real civility, or politcsse du coeur.<br />\nThe true gentleman, like the late Judge<br />\nGeorge William Brown, is always gentle, under<br />\nall circumstances, and .to all sorts and conditions of men. \"Manners maketh man,\" but<br />\ngood manners are not put on and put off at the<br />\nwill of the individual.<br />\nGentle qualities, inherited or early acquired,<br />\nare never really forgotten. I once saw a Christian minister who, in his old age and natural<br />\ndecay, had forgotten all his theology, all his<br />\nsermons, his Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, and<br />\neven the names of his own familiar friends, as<br />\ndid Ralph Waldo Emerson in his last years;<br />\nbut the clergyman and the philosopher never<br />\nforgot their gentle habits and good manners<br />\neven to the last. There is something which survives all other forms of teaching and that is<br />\ncharacter, which includes personal ethics, a decent regard for social convention and the feelings of other people. Good manners are shnply good habits, inherited customs or rules of<br />\nconduct personified. Without manners all<br />\nother education is vain.<br />\nConsider the importance of intelligent<br />\npatriotism in school or college training. It was<br />\nno unimportant contribution when, in 1888,<br />\nThe Youth's Companion started the idea of<br />\nraising an American flag overy every public<br />\nschool house. That idea has now become an<br />\nestablished institution based upon j)opular legislation. The Stars and Stripes are now a<br />\nrecognized symbol of patriotism in almost<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n.every youthful seminary of learning in these<br />\nUnited States. Instead of personal devotion<br />\nto king or emperor, queen or prince, American<br />\nschool children are now taught to regard with<br />\npride and affection the flag of their country<br />\nand to be true to their national colors. Boys<br />\nand girls see in that flag an emblem of the<br />\nAmerican Union, a star for every State and<br />\nthirteen stripes representing the original members of the Old Confederation. It is folly to<br />\ndiscourage or underrate patriotic sentiment in<br />\nthe education of youth. The pity is that love<br />\nof country is not more universal in America.<br />\nAs our young people grow older, they are<br />\nsometimes taught to speak disrespectfully of<br />\nour National Government and of the democratic tendencies of our time.<br />\nThere is something wrong in that system of<br />\nhigher education which produces cynics and<br />\nmere critics, malcontents with the \"the powers<br />\nthat be\" and with the manifest destiny of the<br />\nAmerican people. It should be the duty of<br />\nevery college man to oppose and repress that<br />\nscoffing, unpatriotic spirit, which, like Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust, is always in the opposition, \"Der Geist der stets vcrneint.\" Men<br />\nneed affirmation rather than denial, positive<br />\ntruth, and not idle negations. Students especially (night to cultivate a healthy optimism, a<br />\ncheerful, hopeful tone and a belief in the future<br />\nof their country. And yet colleges abound<br />\nin political agnostics and unbelievers in democracy. Some self-styled \" reformers\" and<br />\nacademic croakers are about as bad in practical<br />\npolitics as Richard Croker and his gang in<br />\nNew York City. The Tammany boss perverts<br />\ngood and efficient government. The reform<br />\nboss sometimes obstructs it and blocks the<br />\nwheels of civic progress because he cannot reform things in his own way. Students and<br />\nteachers alike need a civic courage which dares<br />\nto do needful things, and not so much of that<br />\ndoubting, timid, halting spirit which says<br />\nHERBERT B.

They occupied a most useful, if not admirable, position in the college life of the day.<br />\nAnd outside the dressing rooms the old<br />\nbrick tennis court, which is familiar to many<br />\nstill at the University, the great disrespect that<br />\nwas shown for the house of the wealthy man<br />\n<br />\nacross the way in matter of disposing of old<br />\ntennis balls and the equally great respect shown<br />\nfor the old colored woman next door when by<br />\nsome mischance the ball slipped through the<br />\nnetting into her august precinct. And the hot<br />\ngames of tennis and the delight of the undergraduate when the blue-cut-away-coat, skywater - blue - trousered, white - flanneled - sock<br />\ngraduate came out to play, and the encouraging<br />\ncries in the great struggle when Greek met<br />\nGreek. The heavy gambling upon results, too,<br />\nwhen, as I have heard it said, as much as eighty<br />\ncents has changed hands in a day. All delightfully innocent vices.<br />\nThese are but a few of many vivid memories<br />\nof the days of five years or more ago. It is a<br />\nrare pleasure today to run across a congenial<br />\nclassmate, and to talk over old times.<br />\nAnd it isn't the problems solved, nor' the<br />\nwork accomplished, that comes up for talk, but<br />\njust such sort of scenes as have been mentioned<br />\nhere. Further, there is not one of them, I<br />\nthink, who went in for such things who would<br />\nnot tell you\u2014confidentially perhaps, but none<br />\nthe less meaninglv\u2014that there are few sensations in his life today that equal those of the<br />\nold days when he caught a fly at a critical moment, threw a piece of rubber between two<br />\nstakes for a winning goal, or got down the field<br />\nfor t went' yards with a brown pig skin filled<br />\nwith air.<br />\nBEN HOWELL GRES\\VoLD, JR.,<br />\nTHE YEAR'S ATHLETICS.<br />\n<br />\nWe have every reason to feel proud of the<br />\nshowing made by our teams in all branches of<br />\nathletics during the past year, which was about<br />\nthe brightest the Black and Blue has ever seen:<br />\nbut even \" better times are coming,\" and with<br />\nthe advent of our new athletic regime, we<br />\nshould gain victories where formerly we were<br />\nwont to meet only defeats.<br />\nRome was not built in a day, and a college<br />\nathlete cannot be developed in a week ; but we<br />\nat Johns Hopkins have shown the country how<br />\nwe can build up in a few months a championship lacrosse team.

We wish it were possible<br />\nto show our appreciation of the efforts of each<br />\nof the other men who have done so much for<br />\nthe team. G. C. Robinson, whose picture appears in another column, has been a most active<br />\n<br />\ndone, and the man who has done the greater<br />\npart of it is William H.

Medical<br />\nSchool of Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nTHERE are few persons connected with the<br />\nUniversity whose personal popularity has been<br />\nso great and whose resignation is so generally<br />\nregretted as in the case of Dr. J. B. Crenshaw,<br />\nthe present director of the gymnasium. Every<br />\nman who came to it found a genuine friend in<br />\nthe\" Colonel,\" and everyone feels that Hopkins<br />\nwill not be quite the same without his genial<br />\nmanners and pleasant disposition. Under his<br />\nsway, gymnasium work has been anything but<br />\nirksome, and in his departure he leaves scores<br />\nof well-wishers behind.<br />\nEvery new institution has at first a struggle<br />\nfor existence, and the NEws-LETTER has been<br />\nno exception to the rule. But now, at the end<br />\nof its third volume, we feel that this period has<br />\nbeen long passed by, and that the paper occupies a permanent place in the college world.<br />\nTo fill this place creditably and to increase its<br />\nusefulness and interest is the next task, and this<br />\nis one which cannot be performed by the editors<br />\nalone. The NEws-I.ErrER is not an ideal college paper. Of that, strange to say, we are<br />\nfully aware, and we are glad to welcome suggestions which may aid in its improvement..<br />\nBut there are one or two other things which are<br />\nnecessary before making any radical alterations. The first of these is support from without, both in subscriptions and in written contributions. We are contemplating for next year<br />\nan enlargement of the paper and other changes<br />\n<br />\nwhich will increase its scope, provided the<br />\nnumber of subscriptions is sufficiently great to<br />\nwarrant it. In case these improvements are<br />\nmade, there will be need of material contributed from the University at large, and from the<br />\nalumni. We hope next year to have a larger<br />\nnumber of alumni among our readers than at<br />\npresent, and our columns will always be open<br />\nto them for suggestions as to college affairs,<br />\netc. In this way THE NEws-LETTER might<br />\nform the long wished-for link between undergraduates and alumni, which would bind them<br />\nmore closely together, and, perhaps, draw the<br />\nolder men more into the support of the various<br />\nstudent enterprises, all of which need their<br />\nbacking, both financial and moral. This is one<br />\nof the most important functions of a college<br />\npaper, and an especially important one at Hopkins. The paper must be of interest to both<br />\nparties, and can be best made so by contributions which will reflect the idea of each upon<br />\nmatters of common interest. In this connection we desire to express our especial thanks to<br />\nPresident Gilman and to Professor Adams,<br />\nboth of whom have accorded us the most generous support.<br />\nIN the history of the past year we are glad<br />\nto chronicle the success which has attended all<br />\nthe college organizations.<br />\nThere has never<br />\nbeen a time when every student undertaking<br />\nhas been so prosperous.

Otherwise, the individual is<br />\nin danger of missing some of the main points<br />\nin life, such as self-knowledge, self-control,<br />\nand due regard for his neighbors. Failing to<br />\ndiscover one's own capabilities and to master<br />\none's self at school or college, the student finds<br />\nthat he has wasted some oil the best years of<br />\nlife, when by closer contact with a more exacting business world he might at least have been<br />\nacquiring more sense and some practical knowledge or useful trade.<br />\nIn every school and college course there are<br />\ncertain objects that are especially worthy of<br />\nachievement, and without them all other educational acquirements are of little account. Of<br />\nwhat use is it to know specialties, or things in<br />\nparticular, and to be a fool in general ? Not<br />\nall the personal culture of which a selfish man<br />\nis capable is worth the common sense and plain<br />\nmorality of a good citizen. \" Knowledge for<br />\nman's self,\" said Lord Bacon, \"is in many<br />\nbranches thereof a depraved thing.\" The<br />\nGreeks called that man an idiot Kuorvo who<br />\nhad no active interest or useful part in civic society. So is he who does not voluntarily conform to the established social order. The first<br />\nduty of all education is to acquire civic sense, a<br />\nspirit of obedience to law and authority. This<br />\nspirit is the primary virtue of every good citizen. It is the law-abiding spirit in contradistinction to lawlessness and anarchy. Order is<br />\nthe proper basis of every school and college, as<br />\nof every civic and social assembly. A student<br />\nwho will not restrain himself in the class room,<br />\nor who disturbs others on college premises, deserves to be repressed or put out of the pre-<br /><br />\nNo. 17<br /><br />\ncincts of learning. And yet many boys and<br />\nyoung men seem to think that school is the<br />\nplace .for mischief and college a fair field for<br />\nhorse play and breaking the public peace. The<br />\nrecent outbreaks of rioting and disorder in<br />\nacademic towns illustrate the survival in America of the antinquated notion that students are<br />\na law unto themselves, and that the rights of<br />\nother people have no existence in a college<br />\ncommunity or under the common law. The<br />\niea of the antiquated notion that students are<br />\napparently still in fashion in American colleges.<br />\nFortunately, Baltimore is a city with a welldeveloped public sense in favor of good government. There is little opportunity or disposition on the part of the student population of<br />\nour 2,000 men in this University Town to<br />\nbreak the local peace. Occasionally, in theatres<br />\nor other public places there have been feeble<br />\nattempts to disturb the performance and interfere with the rights of others, but such attempts have always been promptly checked by<br />\ncivic common sense, if not by the police. in<br />\nBaltimore public opinion clearly recognizes<br />\nthat student pranks and misdemeanors do not<br />\nAny old-time<br />\nbefit a civilized community.<br />\nsympathizer with college disorder, on the<br />\nground that this is a display of true college<br />\nspirit, is a foe of higher education and good citizenship. Sooner or later, even in our country<br />\ncolleges, boys must learn by severe treatment<br />\nthat they, too, are under law and that their first<br />\nduty is to obey it. The mere fact that there<br />\nstill survives in some institutions an avowed<br />\nsympathy with antiquated, barbaric customs<br />\nproves conclusively that the modern civic sense<br />\nhas not yet fully evolved and has not triumphed<br />\nover medimval nonsense. Where that savage<br />\nspirit of student lawlessness still prevails, there<br />\nthe primary object of higher education in civic<br />\nsociety has not been accomplished.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nOur American schools and colleges sometimes break ,down at the most critical point,<br />\nnamely, in respect for common law, constituted<br />\nauthority, and the rights of property on which<br />\nall good government and civilization rest. A<br />\nprofessed scholar who is not at the same time a<br />\ndecent and orderly citizen is an anomalous<br />\nbeing. He is an uncivil, uneducated clown.<br />\nEdmund Burke said: \" Men cannot enjoy the<br />\nrights of an uncivil and civil state together.\"<br />\nIt is not often in this academic community<br />\nthat students break the peace by noisy demonstrations,. What such things will inevitably<br />\nlead to, if encouraged, is indicated in the Public Ledger of Philadelphia for Saturday, May<br />\n27, 1899, which records the fact that, on the<br />\npreceding day, college students of the University of Pennsylvania started out, after chapel<br />\nexercises, to celebrate the conclusion of lectures for the academic year just closing. About<br />\n400 juniors, sophomores, and freshmen formed<br />\nin lines of fours and paraded about the campus<br />\nand through the principal buildings singing<br />\ncollege songs and at intervals giving the familiar yells. The more prominent of the professors were visted in their lecture rooms and<br />\ncalled upon for speeches. The celebration was<br />\ncontinued by the students marching along some<br />\nof the public streets, stealing signboards and<br />\nlooting an ice wagon ! One of the rioters was<br />\nstruck in the ribs by an ice hatchet and severely<br />\nwounded. Four students were caught by the<br />\npolice and taken to the station-house. They<br />\nwere charged with breach of the peace, and<br />\neach offender was held for trial on $400 bail.<br />\nThese contemporary facts may be thought<br />\nfunny and characteristic of college life, but they<br />\nare quite unworthy of liberal education, as are<br />\nsome other well-known abuses of student freedom still tolerated in academic institutions. It<br />\nsometimes seems that school and college culture is not even skin deep. For example, when<br />\ncollegians this very spring painted red the<br />\nstatue of John Harvard, or, some years ago,<br />\nbranded with fire candidates for initiation to<br />\na college fraternity. If the enlightened sentiment of faculties and upperclassmen do not<br />\nsoon suppress student savagery and rowdyism<br />\nof all sorts, the police courts probably will.<br /><br />\nIn these democratic days, when even American children are becoming pert and freshmen<br />\nregardless of their elders, it is time to revive<br />\nand cultivate the principle embodied in that<br />\nsaying of William of Wykeman, Bishop of<br />\nWinchester, who founded a collegiate school in<br />\nthat cathedral town and also New College at<br />\nThat<br />\nOxford: \"Manners maketh man.\"<br />\ncharacterizes<br />\nstill<br />\nmotto of Winchester School<br />\nthe students of England.

However, if one<br />\nmust give way, I prefer activity of mind, and<br />\nan interest in his work, to high scholarship, for<br />\nthe one can be acquired more easily than the<br />\nother.\"<br />\nAt Rugby, as all school boys know, the<br />\n.inethod of government is by the good example<br />\nof masters and the older boys, the so-called<br />\n\" sixth form.\" The influence of seniority was<br />\nstrongly felt at Phillips Exeter Academy in my<br />\nschool days, when uppper class athletes ruled<br />\nthe lower classes, and when appointed senior<br />\nleaders sat together on a high bench at prayers<br />\nand when eery class room was firmly governed, even in the teacher's absence, by a socalled \" monitor,\" who was chosen by authority because of his eminent qualities as a man<br />\nand as a scholar. Boys always educate one<br />\nanother in school and out. Gladstone said he<br />\nlearned more in a student debating society at<br />\nEton than from his masters. England's statesmen are trained on the cricket field and on the<br />\nriver. Boys in a boat and in all athletic training obey their \"coach \" and captain as absolutely as soldiers obey orders, and this is right.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nAmong all the personal influences proceeding from native ability, athletic skill, classical<br />\nculture, literary talent, and mathematical genius, nothing is more important than acknowledged \" good form\" in everything that is said<br />\nor done. Some boys possess this quality by<br />\nnature or acquire it almost- instinctively by association, but some never learn how to do<br />\nthings or say things properly. Rude and uncouth from the very beginning of school or college life, they remain so throughout their enlire course and in after life are still lamentably<br />\ndeficient. Some boys have only a kind of superficial polish with no real substance of knowledge or character. They seem to have only the<br />\nexternal forms of politeness on certain occasions, but no real civility, or politcsse du coeur.<br />\nThe true gentleman, like the late Judge<br />\nGeorge William Brown, is always gentle, under<br />\nall circumstances, and .to all sorts and conditions of men. \"Manners maketh man,\" but<br />\ngood manners are not put on and put off at the<br />\nwill of the individual.<br />\nGentle qualities, inherited or early acquired,<br />\nare never really forgotten. I once saw a Christian minister who, in his old age and natural<br />\ndecay, had forgotten all his theology, all his<br />\nsermons, his Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, and<br />\neven the names of his own familiar friends, as<br />\ndid Ralph Waldo Emerson in his last years;<br />\nbut the clergyman and the philosopher never<br />\nforgot their gentle habits and good manners<br />\neven to the last. There is something which survives all other forms of teaching and that is<br />\ncharacter, which includes personal ethics, a decent regard for social convention and the feelings of other people. Good manners are shnply good habits, inherited customs or rules of<br />\nconduct personified. Without manners all<br />\nother education is vain.<br />\nConsider the importance of intelligent<br />\npatriotism in school or college training. It was<br />\nno unimportant contribution when, in 1888,<br />\nThe Youth's Companion started the idea of<br />\nraising an American flag overy every public<br />\nschool house. That idea has now become an<br />\nestablished institution based upon j)opular legislation. The Stars and Stripes are now a<br />\nrecognized symbol of patriotism in almost<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\n.every youthful seminary of learning in these<br />\nUnited States. Instead of personal devotion<br />\nto king or emperor, queen or prince, American<br />\nschool children are now taught to regard with<br />\npride and affection the flag of their country<br />\nand to be true to their national colors. Boys<br />\nand girls see in that flag an emblem of the<br />\nAmerican Union, a star for every State and<br />\nthirteen stripes representing the original members of the Old Confederation. It is folly to<br />\ndiscourage or underrate patriotic sentiment in<br />\nthe education of youth. The pity is that love<br />\nof country is not more universal in America.<br />\nAs our young people grow older, they are<br />\nsometimes taught to speak disrespectfully of<br />\nour National Government and of the democratic tendencies of our time.<br />\nThere is something wrong in that system of<br />\nhigher education which produces cynics and<br />\nmere critics, malcontents with the \"the powers<br />\nthat be\" and with the manifest destiny of the<br />\nAmerican people. It should be the duty of<br />\nevery college man to oppose and repress that<br />\nscoffing, unpatriotic spirit, which, like Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust, is always in the opposition, \"Der Geist der stets vcrneint.\" Men<br />\nneed affirmation rather than denial, positive<br />\ntruth, and not idle negations.

The Tammany boss perverts<br />\ngood and efficient government. The reform<br />\nboss sometimes obstructs it and blocks the<br />\nwheels of civic progress because he cannot reform things in his own way.

But now, at the end<br />\nof its third volume, we feel that this period has<br />\nbeen long passed by, and that the paper occupies a permanent place in the college world.<br />\nTo fill this place creditably and to increase its<br />\nusefulness and interest is the next task, and this<br />\nis one which cannot be performed by the editors<br />\nalone. The NEws-I.ErrER is not an ideal college paper. Of that, strange to say, we are<br />\nfully aware, and we are glad to welcome suggestions which may aid in its improvement..<br />\nBut there are one or two other things which are<br />\nnecessary before making any radical alterations. The first of these is support from without, both in subscriptions and in written contributions. We are contemplating for next year<br />\nan enlargement of the paper and other changes<br /><br />\nwhich will increase its scope, provided the<br />\nnumber of subscriptions is sufficiently great to<br />\nwarrant it. In case these improvements are<br />\nmade, there will be need of material contributed from the University at large, and from the<br />\nalumni. We hope next year to have a larger<br />\nnumber of alumni among our readers than at<br />\npresent, and our columns will always be open<br />\nto them for suggestions as to college affairs,<br />\netc. In this way THE NEws-LETTER might<br />\nform the long wished-for link between undergraduates and alumni, which would bind them<br />\nmore closely together, and, perhaps, draw the<br />\nolder men more into the support of the various<br />\nstudent enterprises, all of which need their<br />\nbacking, both financial and moral. This is one<br />\nof the most important functions of a college<br />\npaper, and an especially important one at Hopkins. The paper must be of interest to both<br />\nparties, and can be best made so by contributions which will reflect the idea of each upon<br />\nmatters of common interest. In this connection we desire to express our especial thanks to<br />\nPresident Gilman and to Professor Adams,<br />\nboth of whom have accorded us the most generous support.<br />\nIN the history of the past year we are glad<br />\nto chronicle the success which has attended all<br />\nthe college organizations.<br />\nThere has never<br />\nbeen a time when every student undertaking<br />\nhas been so prosperous. The most disappointing feature of the year was the career of the<br />\nfootball team. Starting with an unusual number of players from other colleges who were at<br />\nthe Medical School and in the graduate department, the team gave every promise of a victorious season. 'foward the close of its career,<br />\nhowever, the loss of two important games put<br />\nit out of the race for the championship.<br />\nThe record made by the lacrosse team is too<br />\nwell known to need comment. Six of the '98<br />\nchampion team were not available for this year,<br />\nand their places consequently had to be filled by<br />\nnew men.
