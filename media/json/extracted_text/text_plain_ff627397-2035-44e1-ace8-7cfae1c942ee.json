It was fully expected that<br />\nthe Hopkins management would readily<br />\nconsent to a return game. It looks now<br />\nas if the athletic relations, so pleasantly<br />\ninaugurated between the two institutions last year, would be severed and<br />\nthat there will be no gridiron contest<br />\nnext fall, either in Charlottesville or<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\n<br />\nGraduate Manager Holmes and<br />\nthe other football officials denied<br />\nthis. The original tentative agreement with Virginia provided that<br />\nall games should be played at<br />\nHomewood, as much larger crowds<br />\nwould attend than if the contest \u2022<br />\nshould be held at Charlottesville.<br />\nIn spite of this agreement, Virginia<br />\ninsisted that the game next fall be<br />\nplayed on their home grounds.<br />\nHopkins was so anxious to get a<br />\nreturn game, that it was agreed that<br />\nif a guarantee of $6o0 be given the<br />\ncontest would be at Charlottesville,<br />\nand Virginia would permitted to<br />\ndisregard the tentative agreement,<br />\nwhich made it obligatory to play at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThis offer was refused by Virginia, although when they came to<br />\nBaltimore last November they were<br />\ngiven $303 expenses and half of<br />\nthe net receipts after the Hopkins<br />\nexpenses had been deducted, making a total of $9oo. This was the<br />\nmost advantageous financial arrangement which any visiting team<br />\nhas ever made with Hopkins.<br />\nManager Lile of the Virginia<br />\nteam was right when he said, according to the Washington paper's<br />\nannouncement, that Hopkins had<br />\ndeclined an offer to play on Lambeth Field, but he should have told<br />\nthe whole truth, and said that the ,<br />\noffer which he made was such that<br />\nwe couldn't have accepted,it without a serious financial loss.

This catalogue is being made in obedience<br />\nto a code of rules upon which the<br />\nBritish and American Library Associat:ons came to substantial agreement in 1908. The English speaking world catalogues this way.<br />\nMoreover, even the size of the card<br />\nselected (7 2x1272cm.). is the international standard one now. This<br />\nis of importance, for a good percentage of our cards can be secured already printed by outside<br />\nagencies, both here and abroad, and<br />\nthey all use this size of card. The<br />\nscope of such help is going to<br />\nwiden cont:nually. National and<br />\ninternational co-operation is a live<br />\ntopic in library circles these days.<br />\nSo important is this source of aid,<br />\npresent and prospective, that even<br />\nif our old catalogue had all virtue<br />\n(which it has not, for it is its defects that form the mainspring Of<br />\nour present un(lertakings) there<br />\nwould be a strong argument in<br />\nfavor of rewriting it on the larger<br />\ncards, so that we might be in position to reap the advantage of cooperative or centralized card-printing. In fact, Harvard and Columbia are doing so today for this very<br />\nreason. The subject headings used<br />\nin our catalogue are chosen from<br />\nlists distributed by the Library of<br />\nCongress.<br />\nBut no matter how efficient the<br />\ncatalogue and its attendant may be<br />\nin turning up the title of a book<br />\ndesired, what is the profit if we<br />\ncannot then find the book? Accordingly, we are assigning to each<br />\nvolume a symbol which, being repeated on its main card in the catalogue, will guide us to it. Each of<br />\nthese silent inhabitants of our<br />\nshelves has his own house number.<br />\nIn probably all libraries nowadays, books are grouped by topics.<br />\nI 1 ere is caste rigid as the Orient's.<br />\nShakespeare ad Euclid will not be<br />\nneighbors. In practically every<br />\nlarge collection, books are preserved in their places and located<br />\nby a system of notation applied to<br />\nthem. But a radically new method<br />\nwas formulated about the time our<br />\nUniversity was founded. Before<br />\nthat period it was the shelf that received numeration. The book was<br />\ndesignated by the number of the<br />\nshelf on which it stood. Both the<br />\nPeabody and the Enoch Pratt libraries of this city give illustrations of this method. Thus with<br />\n<br />\nsuch a number as \u20141234 in a Peabody book, the minus sign tells that<br />\nit is on the left side of the building,<br />\nwhile i indicates the floor, 2 the<br />\nalcove, 3 the press, and 4 the shelf,<br />\nwhere the volume is to be found.<br />\nSuch a scheme were unexcelled if<br />\nonly the 'librarian could be omniscient, i. e., if he could at the beginning so allot shelf room to subjects<br />\nthat the empty space left at the end<br />\nof each for growth would be filled<br />\nat the same moment a generation<br />\nlater. But this does not happen. A<br />\nsubject uses up all its space, but it<br />\ncannot dislodge its more slowly<br />\ngrowing neighbor except at the expense of changing all the latter's<br />\ncall numbers. Hence, it leaps in<br />\nits extension to some other empty<br />\nplace in the library, and thus its<br />\ncontinuity is broken. Finally, we<br />\nget a crazy-quilt effect, which is<br />\nmost disconcerting to readers and<br />\nstaff, if the time comes when for<br />\nany reason the,former are admitted<br />\nfreely to the shelves. Therefore,<br />\nin place of this system of \"fixed<br />\nlocation,\" there has come into vogue<br />\nthat pf \"relative location,\" whereby not the shelves but the subjects<br />\nare numbered. If the subjectgroups are assigned letters or<br />\nnumbers in sequence, A or No.<br />\npreceding B or No. 2, such letters or numbers will always disclose the whereabouts of the books<br />\nto us, no matter how unevenly the<br />\nsubjects grow, or how many structural changes the building may<br />\nundergo. Book-notation is not then<br />\nthe simple task of numbering library furniture, but it is the encyclopedic one of classifying the<br />\nwhole field of human knowledge,<br />\nas recorded in books, and numbering in logical order every division<br />\nof the scheme. There are various<br />\nsystems of classification in existence. The one most widely known<br />\nis the decimal plan of Melvil<br />\nDewey. We have adopted here the<br />\nschedules being worked out at the<br />\nLibrary of Congress. In this,<br />\ntwenty-one large subjects are designate by the letters of the alphabet, except I, 0, W, X, Y. In<br />\nmost of these twenty-one subjects a few main sub-divisiOlis are<br />\ndesignated by adding a second letter to the first. Thus Q is Science, QA Mathematics, QB Astronomy, QC Physics, QD Chemistry, QE Geology, etc. Further<br />\nsub-divisions are indicated by running numbers from i to 9999 if<br />\nnecessary, and even these fine topics can be split indefinitely by the<br />\nuse of decimals. For example.<br />\nQA is Mathematics, QAI is<br />\nMathematical. jourtials, QA 17I is<br />\nTheory of groups, QA552 is Plane<br />\nanalytic geometry, etc., etc.<br />\nNow, every book on the same<br />\ntopic has the same class number,<br />\nor familyname, as we may say.<br />\nAll books on \"theory of groups\"<br />\n<br />\niurnrit Art Tompang<br />\n<br />\nIt will pay you to look, through our Splendid<br />\nAssortment of Materials AT POPULAR Prices.<br />\n<br />\nBy M.

Although Carlisle, the Navy,<br />\nGettysburg, and Stevens and the<br />\nMaryland colleges meet us with no<br />\nconditions, Virginia, with her peculiar self-favoring standards of athletic'honor, could not play at Homewood unless she were given the<br />\nadvantages which she demanded\u2014<br />\nadvantages which practically dezided the game in advance.<br />\n,<br />\nAnd when the game was lost,<br />\nHopkins, with true spirit, uttered<br />\nno squeal. \"Virginia outclassed us,\"<br />\nwas the way THE NEws-LETTER<br />\nput it, and there was not a word<br />\nsaid of the injustice the four-year<br />\nrule worked on us.

In view<br />\nof the interest and support which<br />\nHopkins graduates have given to<br />\nthe various teams, it would neither<br />\nbe polite nor advisable for the Association to act radically contrary to<br />\nthe weight of opinion which may<br />\nbe developed by the meeting, and<br />\nthe ideas of the alumni should be<br />\ngiven serious consideration.<br />\nIt seems to us, hOwever, that the<br />\nreal decision in the matter of a<br />\nfour-year rule should not be made<br />\nby the Athletic Board until the<br />\nviews of the students have been ascertained. THE NEWS - LETTER,<br />\ntherefore, urges that after the<br />\nalumni conference, a student massmeeting be called. This could well<br />\nfollow a meeting of the Board at<br />\nwhich a policy had been determined<br />\nupon and the vote could be upon<br />\nthe rejection, ratification or amendment of the Board's suggestion.<br />\nOr, if it should be preferred, the<br />\nmass-meeting could initiate as well<br />\nas act finally.

On<br />\nthe contrary, Billie is an accomplished littcratcur, and an authority<br />\non dogs,, while his printed child is<br />\nan interesting and probably authoritative little volume which deals with<br />\n\"The Airedale\"*\u2014\"the biggest and<br />\nbest terrier.\" It (the book, not the<br />\nterrier) well merits a place among<br />\nth e monographs and dissertations,<br />\nWhich, to quote the words of Dr.<br />\nGilman, are \"gathered like a bibliothecal cairn in the office of the<br />\ntrustees to remind every officer and<br />\nvisitor of our productivity in<br />\nscience and letters.\"<br />\nIt is always better for. the book reviewer, if he knows nothing of the<br />\nsubject matter of the publication<br />\nUpon which he is to comment, and<br />\nthat is the case in this instance. ReMarkable as it may seem, the present writer has attended Hopkins<br />\nfor some time, and must now confess to a complete ignorance of<br />\ndogs.<br />\nViewing \"the volume which we<br />\nhave before us\"externally, and,some<br />\nmay say that this is the most attractive viewpoint, we see that it is a<br />\nsmall book of 102 pages, not including advertisements. The cover is of<br />\nlight green, with artistic decorations in a darker shade of the same<br />\ntint. 'Without its paper cover, the<br />\ntome weighs five and one-half<br />\nounces, and in the same state of<br />\nnudity, is seven and three-sixteenth<br />\ninches long and four and elevensixteenth inches wide.<br />\nThe first thing which strikes the<br />\neye of the inquirer, is the news that<br />\nBill is \"some\" author.

We can't help objecting,<br />\nhowever, to the use of \"humans\"<br />\nreferring to people, no matter<br />\nwhat the newspaper usage may<br />\nscem to sanction, and we wonder<br />\nwhether there is any such word as<br />\n\"bebelled.\" Still it is expressive and<br />\noriginal, and Billie always was<br />\nL.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be endorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nWhich, upon request, will be withheld.)<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nJANUARY 5, 1912.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSince the publication of the letter<br />\nSigned \"Democratic Student,\" a few<br />\nWeeks ago, I have not noticed any<br />\ndiscussion of the request for the<br />\nformation of a Woodrow Wilson,<br />\nClub at Johns Hopkins. Organizations have been formed, however,<br />\nat colleges in all parts of the country and it is only right that such<br />\nShould be the case here, where<br />\nGovernor Wilson was a graduate<br />\nstudent and fellow. He is certainly<br />\na Hopkins man almost as much as<br />\nhe is a Princeton alumnus.<br />\nPossibly, however, the reluctance<br />\nto form a club at Hopkins comes<br />\nfrom the fact that nothing such<br />\na student body could do, would<br />\nbe able to cause the Maryland delegation to the Democratic National<br />\nConvention to be instructed in<br />\nfavor of Wilson. The New Jersey<br />\ngovernor killed his chances for<br />\nsupport in Maryland by his espousal of the initative and referendum, and the delegates from Maryland will vote for some other candidate\u2014probably Champ Clark, or<br />\nGovernor Harmon. If Wilson is<br />\nnot nominated, the Woodrow Wilson League of College Men will<br />\nPass out of existence. Maybe it is<br />\nbetter after all to wait and see who<br />\nthe candidate is going to be. Then<br />\nit will be time enough to form a<br />\nHopkins organization ,to help along<br />\nhis candidacy.<br />\nCONSERVATIVE.<br />\n<br />\njustice demands explanation. As<br />\na former Chicago student I kindly<br />\nrequest that you print the following:<br />\nI prefer Hopkins to Chicago, or<br />\nI would not be here. But to give<br />\nthe too often accepted idea credence<br />\nthat the University of Chicago is<br />\na shoddy advertiser is unfair. For<br />\none not acquainted with the institution to take a statement\u2014or perhaps a mere professorial joke\u2014out<br />\nof its context and give it as an example of the scholarship of a<br />\nfriendly institution is unfair and<br />\nunscientific, and hence contrary to<br />\nthe Hopkins spirit.<br />\nAn individual or an institution<br />\nthat is young and rich is always<br />\nable to excite jealously among the<br />\nless fortunate and less . progressive.<br />\nChicago has, therefore, been derided as has Leland Stanford. The<br />\nuniversity is often accused of support by a colossal corporation with<br />\nill-gotten gains.

It was fully expected that<br />\nthe Hopkins management would readily<br />\nconsent to a return game. It looks now<br />\nas if the athletic relations, so pleasantly<br />\ninaugurated between the two institutions last year, would be severed and<br />\nthat there will be no gridiron contest<br />\nnext fall, either in Charlottesville or<br />\nBaltimore.<br /><br />\nGraduate Manager Holmes and<br />\nthe other football officials denied<br />\nthis. The original tentative agreement with Virginia provided that<br />\nall games should be played at<br />\nHomewood, as much larger crowds<br />\nwould attend than if the contest \u2022<br />\nshould be held at Charlottesville.<br />\nIn spite of this agreement, Virginia<br />\ninsisted that the game next fall be<br />\nplayed on their home grounds.<br />\nHopkins was so anxious to get a<br />\nreturn game, that it was agreed that<br />\nif a guarantee of $6o0 be given the<br />\ncontest would be at Charlottesville,<br />\nand Virginia would permitted to<br />\ndisregard the tentative agreement,<br />\nwhich made it obligatory to play at<br />\nHomewood.<br />\nThis offer was refused by Virginia, although when they came to<br />\nBaltimore last November they were<br />\ngiven $303 expenses and half of<br />\nthe net receipts after the Hopkins<br />\nexpenses had been deducted, making a total of $9oo. This was the<br />\nmost advantageous financial arrangement which any visiting team<br />\nhas ever made with Hopkins.<br />\nManager Lile of the Virginia<br />\nteam was right when he said, according to the Washington paper's<br />\nannouncement, that Hopkins had<br />\ndeclined an offer to play on Lambeth Field, but he should have told<br />\nthe whole truth, and said that the ,<br />\noffer which he made was such that<br />\nwe couldn't have accepted,it without a serious financial loss.

This catalogue is being made in obedience<br />\nto a code of rules upon which the<br />\nBritish and American Library Associat:ons came to substantial agreement in 1908. The English speaking world catalogues this way.<br />\nMoreover, even the size of the card<br />\nselected (7 2x1272cm.). is the international standard one now. This<br />\nis of importance, for a good percentage of our cards can be secured already printed by outside<br />\nagencies, both here and abroad, and<br />\nthey all use this size of card. The<br />\nscope of such help is going to<br />\nwiden cont:nually. National and<br />\ninternational co-operation is a live<br />\ntopic in library circles these days.<br />\nSo important is this source of aid,<br />\npresent and prospective, that even<br />\nif our old catalogue had all virtue<br />\n(which it has not, for it is its defects that form the mainspring Of<br />\nour present un(lertakings) there<br />\nwould be a strong argument in<br />\nfavor of rewriting it on the larger<br />\ncards, so that we might be in position to reap the advantage of cooperative or centralized card-printing. In fact, Harvard and Columbia are doing so today for this very<br />\nreason. The subject headings used<br />\nin our catalogue are chosen from<br />\nlists distributed by the Library of<br />\nCongress.<br />\nBut no matter how efficient the<br />\ncatalogue and its attendant may be<br />\nin turning up the title of a book<br />\ndesired, what is the profit if we<br />\ncannot then find the book? Accordingly, we are assigning to each<br />\nvolume a symbol which, being repeated on its main card in the catalogue, will guide us to it. Each of<br />\nthese silent inhabitants of our<br />\nshelves has his own house number.<br />\nIn probably all libraries nowadays, books are grouped by topics.<br />\nI 1 ere is caste rigid as the Orient's.<br />\nShakespeare ad Euclid will not be<br />\nneighbors. In practically every<br />\nlarge collection, books are preserved in their places and located<br />\nby a system of notation applied to<br />\nthem. But a radically new method<br />\nwas formulated about the time our<br />\nUniversity was founded. Before<br />\nthat period it was the shelf that received numeration. The book was<br />\ndesignated by the number of the<br />\nshelf on which it stood. Both the<br />\nPeabody and the Enoch Pratt libraries of this city give illustrations of this method. Thus with<br /><br />\nsuch a number as \u20141234 in a Peabody book, the minus sign tells that<br />\nit is on the left side of the building,<br />\nwhile i indicates the floor, 2 the<br />\nalcove, 3 the press, and 4 the shelf,<br />\nwhere the volume is to be found.<br />\nSuch a scheme were unexcelled if<br />\nonly the 'librarian could be omniscient, i. e., if he could at the beginning so allot shelf room to subjects<br />\nthat the empty space left at the end<br />\nof each for growth would be filled<br />\nat the same moment a generation<br />\nlater. But this does not happen. A<br />\nsubject uses up all its space, but it<br />\ncannot dislodge its more slowly<br />\ngrowing neighbor except at the expense of changing all the latter's<br />\ncall numbers. Hence, it leaps in<br />\nits extension to some other empty<br />\nplace in the library, and thus its<br />\ncontinuity is broken. Finally, we<br />\nget a crazy-quilt effect, which is<br />\nmost disconcerting to readers and<br />\nstaff, if the time comes when for<br />\nany reason the,former are admitted<br />\nfreely to the shelves. Therefore,<br />\nin place of this system of \"fixed<br />\nlocation,\" there has come into vogue<br />\nthat pf \"relative location,\" whereby not the shelves but the subjects<br />\nare numbered. If the subjectgroups are assigned letters or<br />\nnumbers in sequence, A or No.<br />\npreceding B or No. 2, such letters or numbers will always disclose the whereabouts of the books<br />\nto us, no matter how unevenly the<br />\nsubjects grow, or how many structural changes the building may<br />\nundergo. Book-notation is not then<br />\nthe simple task of numbering library furniture, but it is the encyclopedic one of classifying the<br />\nwhole field of human knowledge,<br />\nas recorded in books, and numbering in logical order every division<br />\nof the scheme. There are various<br />\nsystems of classification in existence. The one most widely known<br />\nis the decimal plan of Melvil<br />\nDewey. We have adopted here the<br />\nschedules being worked out at the<br />\nLibrary of Congress.

Although Carlisle, the Navy,<br />\nGettysburg, and Stevens and the<br />\nMaryland colleges meet us with no<br />\nconditions, Virginia, with her peculiar self-favoring standards of athletic'honor, could not play at Homewood unless she were given the<br />\nadvantages which she demanded\u2014<br />\nadvantages which practically dezided the game in advance.<br />\n,<br />\nAnd when the game was lost,<br />\nHopkins, with true spirit, uttered<br />\nno squeal. \"Virginia outclassed us,\"<br />\nwas the way THE NEws-LETTER<br />\nput it, and there was not a word<br />\nsaid of the injustice the four-year<br />\nrule worked on us.

In view<br />\nof the interest and support which<br />\nHopkins graduates have given to<br />\nthe various teams, it would neither<br />\nbe polite nor advisable for the Association to act radically contrary to<br />\nthe weight of opinion which may<br />\nbe developed by the meeting, and<br />\nthe ideas of the alumni should be<br />\ngiven serious consideration.<br />\nIt seems to us, hOwever, that the<br />\nreal decision in the matter of a<br />\nfour-year rule should not be made<br />\nby the Athletic Board until the<br />\nviews of the students have been ascertained. THE NEWS - LETTER,<br />\ntherefore, urges that after the<br />\nalumni conference, a student massmeeting be called. This could well<br />\nfollow a meeting of the Board at<br />\nwhich a policy had been determined<br />\nupon and the vote could be upon<br />\nthe rejection, ratification or amendment of the Board's suggestion.<br />\nOr, if it should be preferred, the<br />\nmass-meeting could initiate as well<br />\nas act finally.

On<br />\nthe contrary, Billie is an accomplished littcratcur, and an authority<br />\non dogs,, while his printed child is<br />\nan interesting and probably authoritative little volume which deals with<br />\n\"The Airedale\"*\u2014\"the biggest and<br />\nbest terrier.\" It (the book, not the<br />\nterrier) well merits a place among<br />\nth e monographs and dissertations,<br />\nWhich, to quote the words of Dr.<br />\nGilman, are \"gathered like a bibliothecal cairn in the office of the<br />\ntrustees to remind every officer and<br />\nvisitor of our productivity in<br />\nscience and letters.\"<br />\nIt is always better for. the book reviewer, if he knows nothing of the<br />\nsubject matter of the publication<br />\nUpon which he is to comment, and<br />\nthat is the case in this instance. ReMarkable as it may seem, the present writer has attended Hopkins<br />\nfor some time, and must now confess to a complete ignorance of<br />\ndogs.<br />\nViewing \"the volume which we<br />\nhave before us\"externally, and,some<br />\nmay say that this is the most attractive viewpoint, we see that it is a<br />\nsmall book of 102 pages, not including advertisements. The cover is of<br />\nlight green, with artistic decorations in a darker shade of the same<br />\ntint. 'Without its paper cover, the<br />\ntome weighs five and one-half<br />\nounces, and in the same state of<br />\nnudity, is seven and three-sixteenth<br />\ninches long and four and elevensixteenth inches wide.<br />\nThe first thing which strikes the<br />\neye of the inquirer, is the news that<br />\nBill is \"some\" author.

The<br />\ndry, bracing air of Colorado and<br />\nthe fever-soaked atmosphere of<br />\nFlorida's everglades, both seem<br />\nto agree with him perfectly.\" This<br />\ndisplay of geographical knowledge<br />\nhas some points in common with<br />\n\"From Greenland's icy mountains,<br />\nTo 'mina's coral strand,\"<br /><br />\nwhich is often warbled on Sunday, but a moment's reflection convinces us that Bill didn't plagiarize.<br />\nThese beautiful phrases, without<br />\ndoubt, originated in his own mind,<br />\nand first flowed from his facile<br />\nquill.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be endorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nWhich, upon request, will be withheld.)<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nJANUARY 5, 1912.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSince the publication of the letter<br />\nSigned \"Democratic Student,\" a few<br />\nWeeks ago, I have not noticed any<br />\ndiscussion of the request for the<br />\nformation of a Woodrow Wilson,<br />\nClub at Johns Hopkins. Organizations have been formed, however,<br />\nat colleges in all parts of the country and it is only right that such<br />\nShould be the case here, where<br />\nGovernor Wilson was a graduate<br />\nstudent and fellow. He is certainly<br />\na Hopkins man almost as much as<br />\nhe is a Princeton alumnus.<br />\nPossibly, however, the reluctance<br />\nto form a club at Hopkins comes<br />\nfrom the fact that nothing such<br />\na student body could do, would<br />\nbe able to cause the Maryland delegation to the Democratic National<br />\nConvention to be instructed in<br />\nfavor of Wilson. The New Jersey<br />\ngovernor killed his chances for<br />\nsupport in Maryland by his espousal of the initative and referendum, and the delegates from Maryland will vote for some other candidate\u2014probably Champ Clark, or<br />\nGovernor Harmon. If Wilson is<br />\nnot nominated, the Woodrow Wilson League of College Men will<br />\nPass out of existence. Maybe it is<br />\nbetter after all to wait and see who<br />\nthe candidate is going to be. Then<br />\nit will be time enough to form a<br />\nHopkins organization ,to help along<br />\nhis candidacy.<br />\nCONSERVATIVE.<br /><br />\njustice demands explanation. As<br />\na former Chicago student I kindly<br />\nrequest that you print the following:<br />\nI prefer Hopkins to Chicago, or<br />\nI would not be here. But to give<br />\nthe too often accepted idea credence<br />\nthat the University of Chicago is<br />\na shoddy advertiser is unfair. For<br />\none not acquainted with the institution to take a statement\u2014or perhaps a mere professorial joke\u2014out<br />\nof its context and give it as an example of the scholarship of a<br />\nfriendly institution is unfair and<br />\nunscientific, and hence contrary to<br />\nthe Hopkins spirit.<br />\nAn individual or an institution<br />\nthat is young and rich is always<br />\nable to excite jealously among the<br />\nless fortunate and less . progressive.<br />\nChicago has, therefore, been derided as has Leland Stanford. The<br />\nuniversity is often accused of support by a colossal corporation with<br />\nill-gotten gains. But, how many<br />\nsmall and equally ill-gotten fortunes<br />\nhave gone into the endowment of<br />\nevery large institution?<br /><br />\nA BUSINESS SCHOOL<br /><br />\nR. Q.
