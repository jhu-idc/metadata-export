A slate varying in color from gray to brownish<br />\nand greenish. It is ranked as an argillite, but por-<br />\ntions of it assume a marked talcose appearance,<br />\nespecially in the Catoctin Mountain and in parts of<br />\nMiddletown Valley, where it has been much dis-<br />\nturbed and altered by proximity to intrusive rocks.<br />\nThese last consist of amphibolites (trap), porphyries,<br />\namygdaloid, serpentine, and epidote.  This last-<br />\nnamed rock is extensively developed both in large<br />\nmasses and intercalated between the slates, and has<br />\nlargely contributed to produce the highly fertile soil<br />\nof Middletown Valley.<br /><br />\nFORMATION No. 10.<br /><br />\nAuroral series of the Pennsylvania Reports. Chazy and<br />\nBlack River Limestones of New York.<br /><br />\nThis constitutes the most extensive limestone for-<br />\nmation of the United States or in the world, its<br />\nentire length being over 600 miles. A small area<br />\nof it occurs in Frederick County near the Monocacy<br />\nRiver, reaching from the Potomac to a point north<br />\nof Woodsboro\u2019, where it is covered by the mezozoic<br />\nor new red sandstone. Between the South and<br />\nNorth mountains, in the Hagerstown Valley, it is<br />\ndeveloped to the extent of more than three-fourths<br />\nthe area of the part of that fine valley within our<br />\nlimits. The soil resting upon this formation is<br />\namong the best in the State.<br /><br />\nFORMATION No. 11.<br />\nMetamorphic Limestones.<br /><br />\nThere are two ranges of these in Maryland, both<br />\nof which have been noticed: 1st. In the gneiss and<br />\nmica slates. 2d. In the western parts of the talcose<br />\nslates of Carroll and Frederick counties.<br /><br />\nFORMATION No. 12.<br /><br />\nMatinal Series in the Pennsylvania Reports, Hudson<br />\nRiver Slates, Utica Slate, and Trenton Limestone in<br />\nthe New York Reports.<br /><br />\nThis formation occurs in Maryland only on the<br />\nwestern side of the Hagerstown Valley, and although<br />\nthe soil it produces is naturally less fertile than the<br />\nadjacent limestone, it can be readily made productive<br />\nif judiciously treated.<br /><br />\n,ng<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\ni<br />\n\u00bb<br /><br />\ni<br />\nR et<br /><br />\n*<br /><br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 51969, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "9e663503-c644-487d-8953-e70946a65663", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/15663-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 15663, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "2c7bd6cb-1e7a-452e-856c-e32634f9f9e5", "url": "/node/15663"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "3f833aa8-caa5-4cf1-bf65-4d8de5fdbf6a"}]}
