The<br />\narrow which is actually embedded in the target is shot<br />\nby the girl herself from a belt concealed under her<br />\ndress. She releases a little spring, the arrow unfolds,<br />\nand shoots straight into the bull's-eye! It is all done in<br />\na flash! So quickly\u2014the eye cannot detect the girl's<br />\nmovements! To heighten the impression that the arrow has gone right through, the girl releases a ribbon<br />\nfrom the front of her dress\u2014the continuation, apparently, of the ribbon attached to the arrow in the target<br /><br />\nKEPT FRESH<br />\nIN THE WELDED<br />\nHUMIDOR PACK<br /><br />\n,,,,<br /><br />\nIt's fun to be fooled<br />\n...it's more fun to KNOW<br />\nLike to see through tricks?
