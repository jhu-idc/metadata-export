The group present endorsed the University<br />\n<br />\nSenate concept as one way to improve University governance. Other subjects discussed were the elimination of<br />\ngrades and attempts to make Homewood courses more<br />\n<br />\nStudents, Faculty Asked<br />\nTo Meet on Governance<br />\nCiting a need to create \"an atmosphere of trust\" between faculty and<br />\nstudents, the Student Council has called for a meeting of the SC and the faculty on the governance issue.<br />\nIn a letter sent to all faculty members, the SC claimed that \"university<br />\ngovernance at the Jonns Hopkins University must be a joint effort of the students and the faculty.\" This joint effort,<br />\nthe letter implied, was being hampered<br />\nby a lack of understanding and cornmunication between students and faculty. The SC hopes to help remedy<br />\nthis lack through the student-faculty<br />\nmeeting, planned for today at four o'clock in Levering Hall.<br />\nJohn Guess, President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, views the meeting as a forum<br />\nwhere both students and faculty will<br />\nbe able to present their opinions on the<br />\ngovernance<br />\nissue<br />\nand \"hopefully,<br />\nbridge the communication gap.\"<br />\nAnother goal of the meeting, suggested Guess, would be to ease what he feels<br />\nIs an attitude of mutual student-faculty<br />\nmistrust. Guess stated that this mistrust would have to end before students<br />\nand faculty could work together on the<br />\ngovernance issue. \"If there can't be any<br />\ntrust now, there won't be any trust<br />\nlater,\" he commented.<br />\nConcrete Action<br />\nGuess indicated that he would also<br />\nlike to see some concrete action resulting from the meeting. He and the<br />\nSC want the Faculty General Assembly<br />\nto issue a new charge to the present ad<br />\nhoc Committee on Governance, directing it to study and recommend procedures to deal with the present dissatisfaction with the governance system.<br />\nThe Governance Committee, chaired by Dr. Woodford Howard, is presently charged only with determining<br />\nwhether \"widespread dissatisfaction\"<br />\nexists with the system. If it finds such<br />\ndissatisfaction, it will be up to a second<br />\ncommittee to recommend changes.<br />\nGuess proposed that this two-step<br />\nprocess be condensed into one. He<br />\nclaimed that the duly elected represen-<br />\n<br />\ntatives of both undergraduate and graduate students bad already expressed<br />\ngreat dissatisfaction with the governance process, thus making the Howard<br />\nCommittee's task somewhat unnecessary.<br />\n<br />\nGalvanize Forces<br />\nStating that \"most representatives<br />\nin the governance system feel that just<br />\nto identify the problem is not enough,\"<br />\nGuess hopes to \"galvanize forces to<br />\nget a special Faculty General Assembly meeting called, because it's the<br />\nonly way to get the committee recharged.\"<br />\nGuess also suggested that since the<br />\nCommittee had done all the preliminary work in investigating the issue, it<br />\nshould also complete the investigation.<br />\n\"Given the wealth of information before the Committee, they should be the<br />\nones to try to find answers,\" commented Guess.<br />\nGuess claimed that he had tried to<br />\nset up an official meeting with the Faculty General Assembly through Dr.<br />\nMichael Beer, its Vice-Cha'rman, in<br />\nlate February. Such a meeting was<br />\nactually planned, said Guess, but was<br />\nsubsequently cancelled by Beer.<br />\nIn response, Beer stated that he<br />\nhad originally consented to such a meeting. He later discovered, however,that<br />\nGuess had not consulted the Howard<br />\ncommittee about the proposed meeting. After telling Guess to talk to the<br />\nCommittee about it, Beer said that he<br />\nhad heard no more.<br />\nDisagreeing with Guess, Beer felt<br />\nthat \"it isn't clear\" that governance<br />\n\"Is a burning issue in the minds of<br />\nstudents.\" He intimated that he was<br />\ntotally satisfied with the progress of<br />\nthe Governance Committee,stating that<br />\n\"things are moving along at as healthy<br />\na pace as can be expected.\"<br />\nBeer also disagreed with Guess'<br />\nclaims that the two-step, two-committee investigation of the governance<br />\nwas time-consuming. Remarked Beer,<br />\n\"I think that these issues are important enough to be considered carefully.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"relevant.\" Nothing was decided by the participants.<br />\nThe faculty Committee on Governance will be holding<br />\ntheir own Open Forum next , Tuesday night,<br />\n<br />\nGrad GovernanceForum<br />\nAttracts SmallAudience<br />\nA scant 25 people showed up at the<br />\nGarrett Room of the library Wednesday night for the Graduate Student Organization's Open Forum on Governance.<br />\nAt the informal meeting, the discussion on the governance question rapidly<br />\nevolved into a more general consideration of the nature of a \"community of<br />\nscholars,\" dealing mainly with what<br />\nwas termed the student's \"impotent\"<br />\nrelationship to the University.<br />\nSuggesting ways to solve this problem, those present supported a concerted effort in favor of a University<br />\nSenate, although this was only one of<br />\nmany possible methods proposed for<br />\nImproving the student's relationship to<br />\nthe University.<br />\n<br />\nElimination of Grades<br />\n<br />\nuniversity hierarchy.<br />\nAn appeal was also made for students to attempt to persuade faculty<br />\nmembers to make courses more \"relevant\" and more personal. Mrs.<br />\nFankhauser pointed out that the knowledge a student is seeking is only a<br />\ntool which he can use later in dealing<br />\nwith his own problems. She agreed<br />\nthat, were professors to describe their<br />\nown experiences in finding the solution<br />\nto questions, the student would benefit<br />\nmuch more than by knowing what the<br />\nquestion was and what the \"correct\"<br />\nanswer eventually turned out to be.<br />\n<br />\nWhat's the Goal<br />\nThe goal of a university education<br />\nwas also given a good deal of consideration. A number of those at the<br />\nmeeting felt that higher education had<br />\nbecome simply a means of obtaining<br />\na better paycheck. This, it was pointed out, was entirely incompatible with<br />\nthe theoretical purpose of education<br />\nbut not at all in opposition to the social<br />\nstandards of white, middle-class<br />\nAmerica.<br />\n<br />\nAmong these proposals was the<br />\nelimination of the grade standard, replacing it with either a pass-fail system or abolishing it all together. It<br />\nwas suggested that while the student,<br />\ncramming his head with the knowledge<br />\nof the professor, is learning facts, he<br />\nis not thinking--or learning to think.<br />\nJill Fankhauser, a graduate student at Hopkins and the leader of most<br />\nof the meeting, stated that the student<br />\nhas been so indoctrinated that he believes \"if he licks enough boots he<br />\nwill someday be free.\" Another graduate student asserted that not only<br />\nuniversity administrators<br />\ndo \"the<br />\nand faculty treat the students as inferiors, but they themselves feel inferior.\"<br />\n<br />\nFurther, it was observed, the very<br />\nstandards upon which admission to and<br />\nsuccess in a university are founded<br />\nare also those of this social stratum<br />\nIn a sense, since the situation has become self-perpetuating.<br />\n<br />\nRepeated reference was made to the<br />\nrecent suspension of an undergraduate<br />\nfor taking several dollars worth of<br />\nbooks from the book store. This incident, it was felt, epitomized the position of the student in the prevailing<br />\n<br />\nHe felt that as the graduate students<br />\nwere rendering the university a service by teaching and as they were already paying more rent than was deserved, they should attempt to organize<br />\nto fight the rent hike.<br />\n<br />\nDiscussing an increase in student<br />\npower, Bob Cotter, President of the<br />\nGraduate Student<br />\nOrganization referred to the rent increase in Wolman Hall by proposing a graduate instructor strike.<br />\n<br />\nsee related stories on page 5<br />\n<br />\n\fMarch 20, 1970<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nCuts In Graduate Admissions Imminent<br />\nBy HOWARD LEVENSON<br />\nCuts in federal grants will<br />\n<br />\nprimarily due to federal money.<br />\n\"When this money is pulled out,<br />\nyou just cannot sustain the graduate school at the same level,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\n<br />\nto keep aid to present graduate<br />\nstudents at current levels, if their<br />\nwork is satisfactory.

It<br />\nis hoped that special restrictive<br />\ngrants made to individual departments<br />\nand corporate awards<br />\nwould provide some relief, though<br />\nhardly the $610,000 which the<br />\n122 awards represents.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert Parr, Chairman of<br />\nthe Chemistry Department, plans<br />\nto admit about the same number<br />\nof new graduate students next<br />\nyear as it did this past year.

Dr.<br />\nPeter Achinstein, Chairman of<br />\nthe Philosophy Department, plans<br />\n<br />\nmake it necessary for many departments at Homewood to decrease admissions of new graduate students or to cut down on<br />\nsupport to current students.<br />\n<br />\ndual professors in the department to divert their research<br />\nfrom post-doctoral to<br />\ngrants<br />\ndoctoral students. Parr also hoped for an increase in competition<br />\nfellowships, such as the National<br />\nInstitute of Health grants.<br />\n<br />\nUnlikely Alternatives<br />\nThese possibilities seem unlikely. Dr. Bevan has received<br />\ninformation to the effect that<br />\nNIH grants are expected to be<br />\nrenewed at only 50% of the current level. Such a turn of events<br />\nwould be of particular concern<br />\nto the biology department, the<br />\nmajority of whose graduate students are currently receiving<br />\nNIH grants. Dean Strider also<br />\nindicated that federal grants for<br />\nfaculty research assistants would<br />\nalso decrease.<br />\nStrider said that the main priority in deciding how many grants<br />\nto award to each department was<br />\nsupport of junior instructors and<br />\nteaching assistants needed to<br />\nteach sections of undergraduate<br />\ncourses. This becomes an even<br />\ngreater priority as the undergraduate body is continually increased.<br />\n<br />\nPh. D.

Such techniques have succeeded in the past...<br />\nThe government is taking a very<br />\nshort-sighted view.\" He also<br />\n<br />\npointed to the effect of the cutbacks on the undergraduate body:<br />\nthe less money granted to graduate students by the government,<br />\nthe more money the university<br />\nwill have to divert to them,and the<br />\nless money the university will<br />\nhave for undergraduates.<br />\nThe outlook for 1971-72 seems<br />\neven bleaker than that for the<br />\ncoming year.

He said he immediately<br />\narranged the meeting scheduled for this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nChuck Fax, one of the two undergraduates sitting on the cammittee,gave the<br />\nfollowing account of events inthe Student<br />\nCouncil leading up to the meeting. Early<br />\nin September the SC interviewed \"seven<br />\nor eight\" candidates for the committee<br />\npositions. Two men were choosen: Fax,<br />\na-senior, and Marvin Kopp,a ,freshman.<br />\nSC president John Guess, who made the<br />\nchoices subject to the Council's approval,<br />\nwas apparently unaware that under a recent amendment to the SC constitution<br />\nthe president of that body was automatically seated on the student relations<br />\ncommittee, leaving only one vacant position to be filled.<br />\nMills was never informed of the deci-<br />\n<br />\nSAC Governance Proposal Given<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee formulated Wednesday a twelve -point revision to Dr. George Owen's proposal on<br />\nUniversity governance.<br />\nEight of the revision's twelve points<br />\ndeal with the SAC's recommendations for<br />\nthe formation of the proposed University<br />\nSenate, and, in general, they provide<br />\nmethods of getting the Senate into operation as quickly as possible.<br />\nThe remaining four segments relate<br />\nthe SAC's opinions on the desirability<br />\nof the Senate, the necessity of its functions as a meeting place for students<br />\nand faculty, the stake of the University<br />\nin theSenate's formation and the departmental grouping for faculty elections.<br />\nOn the last point,the SAC recommended grouping related departments to elect<br />\nthe faculty members to the Senate. The<br />\nopinion of the Committee was that Dr.<br />\nOwen's original proposal, made last<br />\nSeptember, discriminated against certain departments.<br />\nUndergraduate member Chris Ohly<br />\nnoted that Owen placed the Humanistic<br />\nStudies faculty on equal footing with<br />\n<br />\nthe Earth and Planetary Sciences department, even though there are many<br />\nmore professors in the Humanities area.<br />\nThe chairman of the Student Relations<br />\nCommittee, Dr. John White of Art History, declared that the SAC's plan was<br />\nnot intended to undercut Owen's University Senate proposal. The only part<br />\nof the Committee's proposal that directly contradicts the Owen plan is their<br />\nrecommendation against Owen's grouping of the faculty into the six departmental areas.<br />\nThe SAC's position on this point grew<br />\nout of a suggestion by undergraduate<br />\nStuart Seidel that the Senate be composed of equal numbers of faculty and students, with a set number of professors<br />\nbeing chosen by each department. Fifty<br />\nper cent of the students would be graduates and fifty per cent undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nDepartmental Pressure<br />\nIn the debate that followed, graduate<br />\nSAC member Richard Conviser noted<br />\n<br />\nthat such a system could be representative. He remarked that the voting for<br />\nthe offices in the Graduate Student Organization rarely was divided along departmental lines.<br />\nDr. White pointed out, however, that<br />\ndepartmental pressures on grad students<br />\ncould reasonably be expected to be less<br />\nthan on members of the departments,<br />\nand that decisions for a department as<br />\nlarge as Physics, for example, could<br />\ninvolve \"literally millions of dollars,\"<br />\nthus increasing pressure.<br />\nOhly and Seidel expressed the opinion<br />\nthat White's objection was irrelevant,<br />\nsince important intra-departmental decisions are not to be in the domain of<br />\nthe University Senate. Faculty representative Alex Sotir claimed that these<br />\nconsiderations of voting divisions were<br />\nprobably not as important as the essential need of the Senate for people with a<br />\nworking knowledge of the topics to be<br />\nconsidered.<br />\n<br />\nsion of the Student Council, and assumed<br />\nthat no appointments had been made. He<br />\nclaimed that he tried to contact Guess<br />\n\"on several occasions,\" but had no success.<br />\nDr. Harvey Woolf of History of Science,<br />\nwho has been on the committee since its<br />\nInception, stated flatly, \"I'm on so many<br />\ncommittees that haven't met,I never gave<br />\nIt a thought.\" Dean Carl Swanson, who<br />\nclaimed that he attends \"seven or eight<br />\ncommittee meetings a week\" was unconcerned. \"I have enough committee meetings already without engendering another<br />\none just for the sake of having it.\"<br />\n<br />\nLetters and Lists<br />\nGuess stated that he had received two<br />\nseparate letters from Mills asking him<br />\nto submit the names of committee members. Immediately following the first of<br />\nthese, the president submitted his appointments to Dean Allyn Kimball's office. Kimball is responsible for the formal organization of the committee system. Mill's second letter to Guess was<br />\nignored. These transactions were completed at the end of October and the beginning of November.<br />\nTwo weeks ago, following an NewsLetter expose of the failures of the committee system, Guess was contacted by<br />\nBruce Hammil, assistant to Kimball.<br />\nApparently engaged in making up the long<br />\nawaited list of community members for<br />\nall the Academic Council's committees,<br />\nhe asked which two of the three SC nominees were to sit onthe Student Relations<br />\nCommittee. Guess named himself and<br />\nFax, excluding Marvin Kopp because he<br />\nfelt that Fax was more \"experienced.\"<br />\nAccording to GS0 president Bob Cotter,<br />\nthe names of the two graduate student<br />\nappointees were approved and transmitted to \"everybody (he) could think of.\"<br />\nThis included Kimball, Bilgrave, Swanson, and Mills, among others.

Ninety-four<br />\nyears later, somebody else has come up with another<br />\none and if it catches on, it might be good for another<br />\ncentury or so.<br />\nStudent-run seminar courses that are conducted with<br />\nminimal, if any, faculty supervision are slowly being<br />\nestablished. The English Department sponsors one that<br />\n<br />\nhas been successful. The Carl Jung seminar in the<br />\nPsychology Department proves that these attempts are<br />\nnot freak occurences.<br />\nThe Jung seminar owes its existence to the enthusiasm<br />\nof Gerry O'Dell, a senior with a concentration in psychology.<br />\nLast semester, O'Dell approached Assistant Psychology Professor Robert Hogan with his plan, and received<br />\napproval. Over the intersession, he recruited six people who would be interested in taking the class, though,<br />\nsince then, the number has swelled to twelve.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Papers<br />\nO'Dell gave six introductory lectures and reading assignments on Jung. Students were obliged to do two<br />\npapers concerning some phase of Jung's writings.<br />\nOne problem that has risen has been the inavailability of guest lecturers. There are very few Jungian<br />\ntherapists on the East Coast and no funds are accessible<br />\nto pay their high fees.<br />\nIn order to avoid the administrative red tape involved in setting up a new course, the students are signed<br />\nup for independent study under Professor Hogan. Hogan,in turn, has given over all responsibility to O'Dell. Grades<br />\nare determined on the basis of two papers. If the papers<br />\naren't done, credit will not be given.<br />\nThe class<br />\nmeets once a week for two hours in a<br />\nseminar room in Ames Hall. No faculty members are<br />\npresent. Attendance is usually very good. As for the<br />\natmosphere of the class, David Levien, one of those<br />\nparticipating, comments, \"Everyone takes the course<br />\nseriously and it is of fairly high quality. People sometimes get into very animated discussions--even into<br />\nfights.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert Hogan is the sponsor of Psychology's new course<br />\nrun by students. The course features a detailed summary of<br />\nthe theories of Carl Jung.<br />\n<br />\nO'Dell is optimistic about the future of such seminars. \"Class sizes have increased to the dehumanizing level. Since Hopkins can't afford to hire new<br />\nfaculty, student seminars could prove to be an alternative.\"<br />\n\"I don't have teaching skills. But I think that I get<br />\nmore done then some professors do in big lectures.\"<br />\nLevien agrees. \"I am very satisfied and pleased\",<br />\nhe says \"that the intellectual level of Hopkins could be<br />\nraised. A kid who spends a semester preparing a course<br />\ncares more than a professor.\" At Hopkins there's a lot<br />\nof freedom to do this sort of thing. Whatever you want to<br />\ndo you can and probably get credit for it, if you use your<br />\nhead.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn a Monday night meeting at Levering Hall, Larry Goldberg (rt.)<br />\nand other participants in yesterday's sit-in discussed their strategy.<br />\n<br />\nBail Ordered Dropped<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 4)<br />\nSeveral minutes of good-natured negotiations with<br />\nMajor Schaubel of the Baltimore City Police followed.<br />\nSchaubel first threatened the demonstrators with arrest<br />\non charges of blocking the sidewalk,but then allowed them<br />\nto move in front of the entrance to the Customs House,<br />\non the condition that they leave a pathway on the sidewalk clear.<br />\nThe participants sat there for several more minutes,<br />\nagain blocking access to the draft board.

As of yet, no speaker has been found for the next and final<br />\nnight. Attempts are now being made to<br />\nget Ramsey Clark, Arthur Goldberg, or<br />\na member of the Chicago '7 to discuss<br />\nthe political role of the university.<br />\n<br />\nimportant.

Walters stated that most<br />\n<br />\nThe Co-op Week will actually begin<br />\non April 5,with a concert by the GoucherHopkins Symphony. During the entire<br />\nfollowing week there will be increased<br />\nbus service between the two institutions,<br />\nextending into the evenings.<br />\n<br />\nCo-op Week has been scheduled for<br />\nthe first week after, vacation due to the<br />\nlack of academic pressure then.<br />\n<br />\nConceived of by the Hopkins and Goucher student councils, the Co-op Week is<br />\nIntended to encourage Hopkins students<br />\nto take advantage of the course offerings<br />\nat Goucher, and vice versa.<br />\n<br />\nAnother aspect of the Co-op Weekwill<br />\nbe a lecture series on \"The Future of<br />\nAmerican Education 1970-2000,\" a discussion on the role of the university in<br />\nAmerican life. Harris Wofford, president-elect of Bryn Mawr College, will<br />\nbegin the series on April 6, when he will<br />\nspeak at Goucher on the topic of radical<br />\nideas in education.<br />\n<br />\nSomething On-Going<br />\nLast spring, before Hopkins announced its plans to admit women, the idea<br />\nof a Co-op Week was born. Originally<br />\nthought of as a substitute for coeducation, it is thought that it will still be<br />\nuseful due to the fact that only a small<br />\nnumber of women will be admitted in the<br />\nnext few years and current reports indicate<br />\nthat most of them will be science-oriented. This is being done so that the University will be relieved of the necessity<br />\nof increasing humanities course.

By sitting-in, the liberals did what the radicals<br />\nwere up to three or four years ago, radicals that are today engaged in<br />\nopenly revolutionary activities. Mr. Nixon had better learn that an increasing number of Americans are getting tired, tired of all the bullshit. At the<br />\nsit-in Assistant U. S. Attorney Alan Barron told the demonstrators that<br />\nhis views on the war were irrelevant, and so he ordered the doorway<br />\ncleared. People have to be willing to put something on the line to accomplish anything, whether it be their arrest record, their jobs, or their lives.<br />\nAn increasing number of people are realizing that. Not only is it Mr.<br />\nNixon's war, but it's also Mr. Nixon's country, and unless we see some<br />\nbasic changes in policy, it's going to be torn apart at the seams.<br />\n<br />\nOn \"Compulsory Studenthood\"<br />\nIt is indeed comforting to know that President Gordon recognizes the<br />\nproblems inherent in a national system which requires of its young people<br />\nthat they remain in school, whether they want to or not. \"Compulsory<br />\nstudenthood\" may be a national problem, but Dr. Gordon seems unwilling<br />\nto adjust at the local level.<br />\nIn a speech this week at the University of Hawaii, Dr. Gordon conceded that faculties \"have been remiss in undergraduate teaching\" and \"adapting higher education\" to the consequences of rapid social and technological<br />\nchange. Yet last year at Homewood, Gordon urged that undergraduates<br />\ninterested in being taught by faculty members interested in teaching, not<br />\njust conducting research, should go to a place like Amherst. Reluctantly,<br />\nhe then conceded that the undergraduate body might be a \"good thing\" as<br />\na \"junior partner\" in the University.<br />\nDr. Gordon recognizes the unfairness of employment practices which<br />\nrequire students, not otherwise intellectually motivated, to go directly<br />\nfrom high school to college and stay. there. He questions the wisdom of<br />\na national policy of higher education for all, but, from his actions on this<br />\ncampus, we feel that he is unwilling to come to grips with the immediate<br />\nproblem of how to improve the lot of those caught in the \"lockstep\"<br />\nsystem, now.<br />\n, He says that \"the ideal would be an open system of ordinary employment, backed by a governmentally-financed system of universal opportun-<br />\n<br />\nMy signature on this page indicates that I agree to abide by all rules<br />\nand regulations of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Applied Physics Laboratory,<br />\nand subject myself to any search or<br />\ndetention necessary for protection of<br />\ninformation or property.<br />\nSuch was our greeting at APL. After<br />\nsigning the above pledge, we were greeted by Richard Ellis, a division director<br />\nand his ever-smiling sidekick.<br />\nOur tour was in historical order.<br />\nIt traced APL's inception during World War II as a missile-development<br />\nthrough its expansion into<br />\nfactory<br />\nsatellite research in the late '50's and<br />\nnow its 3-dimensional pictures, mass<br />\ntransportation, schemes and plans to<br />\nhelp the blind see.<br />\nIt was also incredibly fast-paced; we<br />\nsaw more equipment, talked to more employees and heard more scientific explanations than anyone could have wished<br />\nin 3 hours.<br />\nEverything was straight and serious,<br />\nwith the creases of determination etched<br />\non all faces. But as is true after speeding for years, their perception is distorted. They have muscles without a<br />\nheart, brilliant brains and underdeveloped souls.<br />\nThe men of APL will just shake their<br />\nheads and sigh at the above observation.<br />\n'Immature, idealistic kids ungrateful<br />\nafter receiving a tour without a hitch'-indeed a tour so perfect that there wasn't<br />\neven time to question the employees about<br />\ntheir life outside the sparkling, whitewashed corridors or the thoughts inside<br />\ntheir dark-hued suits.<br />\n<br />\n\"We wouldn't like to be as weak as<br />\nHungary,\" shouted a red-faced man in<br />\nhis late fifties. In fact, they were all in<br />\ntheir late fifties, these men who run the<br />\nAPL.<br />\nThere were seven of them in their large<br />\ncarpeted board room, with one wall jammed with portraits of the present and past<br />\nmen of the laboratory.

Graham Nash<br />\nis of Hollies fame.Steve Stills was with the Buffalo Springfield until they broke up.Neil Youngwas also with Springfield, but after they broke up he started his own group,<br />\nhumbly titled Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Jerry Garcia<br />\nis still with the Grateful Dead but has lately been making<br />\na reputation for himself as a traveling pedal steel guitar<br />\nplayer (see Volunteers, by the Jefferson Airplane). John<br />\nSebastian was at one time the Loving Spoonful, but now is<br />\nJust amazing John Sebastian. Dallas Taylor used to be the<br />\ndrummer in Clear (Whatever happend to them?)

That doesn't make it old, it makes it flavorful.<br />\nThe album mixes, and it holds togetherwell. As Nash puts<br />\nIt, \"Our main thing is to set some kind of a mood; our only<br />\nrule when it comes to choosingour music is to pick something that gets us off.\"<br />\n<br />\nkr<br />\n<br />\nAkoke<br />\n<br />\nIf You Love<br />\nIf you loved the Buffalo Springfield, or the first Crosby,<br />\nStills, and Nash Album, or the Neil Young with Crazy<br />\nHorse Album, you'll like this one. The album is Crosby,<br />\nStills, Nash, and Young, with Taylor and Reeves providing strong support. Sebastian plays mouth harp on the<br />\ntitle cut, \"Deja vu,\" and Garcia the steel pedal guitar on<br />\nNash's light, once only-slightly country, tune, \"Teach<br />\nYour Children.\"<br />\nThe album is not the gang rape that I expected when I<br />\nfirst heard of the Crosby,Stills, Nash and Young collaboration. Though I wasn't sure who was going to get raped,<br />\nIt seemed apparent at the time that the album would be a<br />\nCS&N versus Young album. Neil Young just didn't seem<br />\nto fit on Nash's island;I couldn't visualize Neil Young being<br />\na crew member on a wooden ship without setting it afire.<br />\nThe problem is solved by making 'Deja Vu' a better<br />\nCrosby, Stills, and Nash Album. The sound is deeper,<br />\ndenser, with more happening and more hidden, less freefloating but no less soaring melodies. The tight harmony<br />\nof Crosby-Stills-Nash is still very much together. When<br />\nYoung sings lead, on his own numbers (\"Helpless\" and<br />\n\"Country Girl\"), the three others build waves of smooth<br />\nharmony behind his high, hard -edged voice. When someone else does the lead vocal, Young stays out of the singing. (Young: \"I don't consider myself to be a background<br />\nsinger.\")<br />\nThe direction that they have taken from CS&N's first<br />\nalbum is probably the finest choice they could have made.<br />\nIt is evident that the group is no longer riding on the<br />\nMarrakesh Express.

Meanwhile, please publish this letter<br />\nto let them know that what appeared on March 13 is a grossly<br />\ninaccurate and distorted picture<br />\nof those views.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nLincoln Gordon<br />\n<br />\nOUT OF LINE<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAlthough it should be evident<br />\nto the discerning reader that Mr.<br />\nCotter's periodic statements as<br />\nto university policy need to be<br />\nviewed with the tolerance accorded the usual politician, his latest<br />\ncomments in reference to the<br />\nhousing of women undergraduates<br />\n(March 10th News-Letter) are so<br />\nfar out of line as to require refutation.<br />\nMr. Cotter states, with characteristic irresponsibility and no<br />\nsubstantive<br />\nevidence, that the<br />\nuniversity is increasing the size<br />\nof the undergraduate body w ith the<br />\nobject of helping to \"relieve its<br />\npresent financial distress\"; he<br />\ntakes the position that the under-<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nBUS. AD. MAJOR<br />\nSAID<br />\nSTATISTICALLY:<br />\n<br />\ngraduate women are to be permanently housed in McCoy Hall<br />\nand not in the Freshman and Upperclass dormitories; he is assuming that the administration<br />\nfeels that women living in the<br />\ndormitories will be in danger<br />\nfrom aggressive undergraduate<br />\nmen; and, by implication, he<br />\ndraws the conclusion that the<br />\nuniversity-owned apartment houses are the exclusive domain of<br />\nthe graduate students. He is wrong<br />\non all counts.<br />\nThe Task Force on Coeducation is, of course, considering<br />\nthe problems which Mr. Cotter<br />\nhas raised. It requested space<br />\nin McCoy Hall, on a temporary<br />\nbasis, for transfer women who<br />\nwill be coming in this fall for<br />\nthe simple reasonthat the dormitory space in the Freshman<br />\ndorms will be needed for the 500<br />\nodd male students of the Class of<br />\n1974 and because the Upperclass<br />\ndorms were not deemed suitable<br />\nfor these women without extensive alterations. Mr. Cotter fails<br />\nto remember that, at an administration-student luncheon last fall,<br />\nhe advocated the same solution<br />\nhimself. The Task Force is understandably concerned with the<br />\nhousing for women, as it is for<br />\nthe men as well, considering the<br />\nquality of the neighborhood east<br />\nand south of the university,and it<br />\nhas further requested that a housing officer be added to the administrative staff to assist all students in acquiring suitable living<br />\nquarters. The Task Force does<br />\nnot view McCoy Hall as a permanent solution to women's housing, but neither does it view the<br />\nuniversity-owned apartments as<br />\nbeing reserved exclusively for<br />\ngraduate students.It acknowledges<br />\nthat priorities need to be established, but only after all aspects<br />\nof student housing are considered.<br />\nTo the best of our knowledge<br />\nthe Freshmen class of 1970-71<br />\nwill not be increased in size. The<br />\nsize of subsequent classes remains to be determined, as does<br />\nthe proportion of women in these<br />\nclasses, but the Task Force expects that Freshman women will<br />\nbe housed in the Freshman<br />\ndormitories. Occupancy of the<br />\nUpperclass dormitories remains<br />\nan opep question because of the<br />\nneed for renovation, but under<br />\n<br />\nno circumstances does the administration consider that the<br />\npresence of women - Freshmen<br />\nor upperclass - in the dormitories will lead to anything other<br />\nthan a natural community of students.<br />\nI do not know what Mr. Cotter<br />\nhopes to gain by his proposed rent<br />\nstrike, but he should plan his<br />\ncampaign on a solid basis of facts<br />\nand not conjectures if he is to<br />\nmake effective use of his office as<br />\ncampaign on a solid basis of facts<br />\nand not conjectures if he is to<br />\nmake effective use of his office<br />\nas president of the Graduate<br />\nStudents Organization for constructive and meaningful change.<br />\nCarl P. Swanson<br />\nAssociate Dean for Undergraduate<br />\nStudies Task Force on Coeduation<br />\n<br />\nCONVISER AGREES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSynechdoche notwithstanding,<br />\nWilliam Benzon's argument in<br />\nthe On Vandalism column of<br />\nMarch 13 is specious.<br />\nI agree strongly with Benzon<br />\non two points: that Hopkins is no<br />\ncommunity, and that students<br />\nshould be given a role in governance. However, I fail to see the<br />\nconnection between the absence<br />\nof this condition and the presence<br />\nof bookstore theft.<br />\nMore particularly, I question<br />\nBenzon's interpretation of the<br />\nrecent theft as \"probably an act<br />\nof vandalism directed against the<br />\nUniversity.\" Benzon does say that<br />\nhe can't be sure of this, and the<br />\nfact that the hearing was closed<br />\nprohibits a direct refutation of<br />\nthis claim. However, Benzon appears to base his agrument on his<br />\ninterpretation of the theft. I wish<br />\nto counter two particulars in his<br />\nargument.<br />\nFirst, even if the accused's<br />\nintent had been to direct an act<br />\nagainst the University, the University would not have been the<br />\nultimate target of his act. His<br />\ntarget would have been the students and faculty (and others)<br />\nwho partronize the bookstore.<br />\nThe bookstore can always raise<br />\nits prices to cover the cost of<br />\ntheft; according to an article in<br />\nthe N. Y. Times Magazine of<br />\nMarch 15, shoplifting causes a<br />\n15% inflation in retail prices.<br />\nThus the victims of theft are you<br />\n<br />\nand me. I happen to believe that<br />\nthe way in which property is<br />\ndistributed in this country is<br />\nwrong. But I'm not in favor of<br />\nreplacing it with an irrational<br />\nand inequitable system of support of the dishonest by the honest.<br />\nSecond, the decision of the appeals board in the recent theft<br />\ncase was not a decision of the<br />\nadministration. It was made by<br />\na board consisting of only students and faculty; students voted<br />\non both sides of the issue.<br />\nI agree with Benzon that the<br />\npunishment given the accused was<br />\nharsh. The appeals board found itself faced with the alternatives of<br />\nprobation (meaningless) or suspension (harsh); it chose the latter. But students here have known<br />\nthat these are the only sanctions<br />\nused by the University in nonacademic matters; why have they<br />\nwaited until now to complain?<br />\nAnd now that they have seen the<br />\nugly consequence that the present<br />\nsystem permits, what are they<br />\ndoing to change it?<br />\nInvolvement in governance<br />\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for students to change Hopkins. The problem here is that<br />\nthe mass of student sits on its<br />\ncollective ass.

Even the<br />\nglossy magazines such as Life,<br />\nTime, etc., have consistently<br />\nachieved a higher level of reporting than this atrocious piece of<br />\ntrash.<br />\nA little research before writing such an article would show<br />\nthat the Women's Liberation<br />\nmovement is for more than<br />\nRoxanne Dunbar's \"No More Fun<br />\n& Games.\" For example, WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIBERATION, published here in Baltimore, and available at the book-<br />\n<br />\nstore, although not claiming to<br />\nbe the journal of the movement,<br />\nhas a circulation almost 3 times<br />\nthat of \"No More Fun &Games.\"<br />\nAs far as the relation between<br />\nWomen's Liberation and Feminism is concerned, they stand in<br />\nrelation to each other as do the<br />\nBlack Liberation movement and<br />\nthe civil rights movement. In<br />\neach case members of the former<br />\nrecognize that sexism and racism<br />\nare intricately tied into capitalism and imperialism and that<br />\nthe former can only be overcome<br />\nby a radical overthrow of the<br />\nentire system.<br />\nThe gross distortions in the<br />\narticle of the ideology of Women's Liberation are almost too<br />\n<br />\nnumerous to correct. Women's<br />\nsexual role is not the central target of Women's Liberation -however, Mr. Olander would do<br />\nwell to realize the extent of sexual<br />\noppression and exploitation to<br />\nwhich women have been, and are<br />\nstill subjected; and given this,<br />\nthat the women for whom sex<br />\nhas been most degrading is justified in renouncing it, just as the<br />\nblack maid is justified in refusing to endure an further the humiliation of cleaning a white<br />\nfamily's mess -- even though<br />\nsuch a refusal may cause unemployment or hardship for her.<br />\nWomen's Liberation is not a<br />\nfemale supremacist ideology,<br />\nfringe elements such as Valerie<br />\nSolanas' SCUM notwithstanding,<br />\nand sees that men too are op-<br />\n<br />\npressed by a system which denies<br />\nthem their emotions, and forces<br />\nthem to find their identity and<br />\nseek gratification through meaningless work experience, vicious<br />\ncompetition and quests for power,<br />\nproviding consolation, and scapegoats in the myth that they are<br />\nsuperior to women.<br />\nFree, legal, abortions and<br />\naccess to birth control are necessary for the liberation of women<br />\n--and if Mr. Olander can not<br />\nunderstand this, I suggest he<br />\nreads a play in the first issue of<br />\nAphra, a new women's literary<br />\njournal, which describes the<br />\nplight of a man who has had an<br />\ninpregnated uterus implanted in<br />\nhim.<br />\nI can only hope that the pages<br />\nof the News-Letter will not be<br />\n<br />\ndefaced in the future by any further irresponsible and distorted<br />\narticles such as Mr. Olander's,<br />\nand that if any more articles appear on the subject of Women's<br />\nLiberation, that the authors will<br />\nattempt to obtain some first hand<br />\ninformation on the matter --perhaps even from the very active<br />\nand strong Women's Liberation<br />\nmovement right here in Baltimore.<br />\nRobert Q.

Scotty cited<br />\nmany reasons for his outlook. First and<br />\nforemost, Coach Scott thinks that this<br />\nYale team, with a number of big boys and<br />\nplenty of speed, is the strongest in recent<br />\nyears. Another factor Scotty emphasized<br />\nwas the depth which Yale has this year at<br />\nall positions. Yale has gotten off to a very<br />\ngood start in pre -season play and already<br />\nlook like they've jelled.<br />\nIn last week's outing the Eli for almost<br />\nthree quarters led last year's club champions, the Long Island Lacrosse Club,<br />\nuntil Long Island tied it up at 4-4 with<br />\nless than a minute to go. This is the<br />\nsame Long Island team, which last year<br />\nbeat Maryland Lacrosse Club, 19-8, for<br />\nthe championship.<br />\nThe Yale team will be here at Homewood after a swing south, scrimmaging<br />\nagainst Washington & Lee and Virginia.<br />\nThis will provide them with even more<br />\npreseason experience before Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nScotty Praises Eli<br />\nCoach Scott had praise for many of<br />\nthe Bulldog starters, particularly their<br />\ngoalie Mike Stanton, who attended Gil-<br />\n<br />\nman School and was voted All-Ivy goalie<br />\nlast year. Scotty also mentioned middie<br />\nCarl Bates (34) and Yale team captain<br />\nJohn Rauth at attack as two fellows to<br />\nwatch tomorrow. These two returnees<br />\naccounted for 3 of the Eli's 4 goals in<br />\nlast year's onesided Hopkins win, 14-4.<br />\nScott also had much praise for middies<br />\nCurt Schmoke (32) and Jim Williams<br />\n(23).<br />\nMany of Yale's outstanding players<br />\nhail from the Baltimore area including<br />\nSchmoke, both starting defensemen Tom<br />\nSolley (31) and Bill Story (34), and goalie<br />\nStanton.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Scott Optimistic<br />\nWhen asked about how our players felt<br />\nabout being overshadowed in the preseason polls by a few other clubs, Coach<br />\nScott stated that, if anything, it has helped<br />\nlift the morale of the team. We're a young<br />\nteam and need experience,\" Scott said,<br />\n\"but the boys have worked veryhard and<br />\nare very anxious to prove themselves,<br />\nand really want to get out there and play.<br />\nI've been encouraged by their improvement over the past few weeks and this is<br />\na very positive sign! Scott also added that<br />\nHopkins has played the club teams and now<br />\nwants to get out and play for real.<br />\n<br />\nHead lacrosse coach Bob Scott talks over strategy<br />\nMoore (r.).<br />\nScott mentioned that the Hopkins team<br />\nshould be ready for tomorrow's game,<br />\nwith all starters ready to go against Yale,<br />\nexcept possibly for middle Gary Handleman, who is nursing shoulder and ankle<br />\ninjuries. He, however, did see some<br />\n<br />\nwith co-captains Doug Honig (1.) and Russ<br />\n'action in the Towson scrimmage earlier<br />\nin the week.<br />\nLook for a much closer opener than<br />\nlast year, as a much stronger, faster,<br />\nand more experienced Yale team tries<br />\nto revenge its 14-4 mauling at our hands<br />\na year ago.<br />\n<br />\nTrack Challenges Confront Masken<br />\n<br />\nPROBABLE STARTING LINE-UP FOR YALE GAME<br />\nPosition<br />\nGOAL<br />\nATTACK<br />\nATTACK<br />\nATTACK<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\n<br />\nPlayer<br />\nKEN DAUSES<br />\nSTU KAHL<br />\nDAN HALL<br />\nPAUL WALLACE<br />\nRUSS MOORE<br />\nDOUG HONIG<br />\nCHARLIE COKER<br />\nROB MACCOOL<br />\nJOE CIELSLOWSKI<br />\nPAUL WEISS<br />\n<br />\nYear<br />\nJUNIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nJUNIOR<br />\nSOPHOMORE<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSOPHOMORE<br />\nSENIOR<br />\n<br />\nNumber<br />\n13<br />\n23<br />\n24<br />\n15<br />\n22<br />\n11<br />\n10<br />\n32<br />\n42<br />\n34<br />\n<br />\nBIA Notes<br />\nIn Wednesday's consolation<br />\nThe 1970 BIA basketball season was brought to a close a match, TEP staged a second half<br />\nweek ago last Wednesday night rally to come from behind to<br />\nfor both the freshman and frat- nudge ATO 43-39.

Like<br />\na dressmaker with too little material he stretched and juggled the available resources, attempting to cover his subject. \"All events are<br />\ncovered, except for the pole vault\" he concluded. Later on as the team dressed he told them,<br />\n\"On the varsity level we are short on distance<br />\njumping and field events, but compared to last<br />\nyear's team, we will do as well or better in all<br />\nevents except for, perhaps, the mile and the pole<br />\nvault.\" In short, anyone who desires to get in<br />\nshape would be welcomed by the team.<br />\nAsked why they decided to join the team this<br />\nyear, newcomers gave various reasons. Sophomore shotputter Mike Shore said, \"I am out for<br />\nthe team because it represents an opportunity to<br />\n<br />\nhelp my school and my track team.\" Freshman<br />\ndiscus thrower Gary Robinson's response was,\"I<br />\nfeel that track is the most basic of all sports. It<br />\nIs your body against a number. It is a primitive<br />\nsport.\"<br />\nIn spite of the cold weather the team has been<br />\npracticing every day. This Saturday, in the first<br />\nof two pre-season meets, the team challenges the<br />\nBaltimore Olympic Club. Mr. Masken summarized his hopes for the coming meet and the rest of<br />\nthe season by saying, \"The year 1s1970 and numbers are importat.\"<br />\nWith the united action of well-developed muscles as an all-inclusive goal, this year's track<br />\nteam appears to be ready for a physically, if not<br />\nstatistically, successful season.<br />\n<br />\nSports Briefs<br />\nPhys Ed Offerings<br />\nThe following are phys ed activities offered for the final session of Spring, 1970.

HOELSCHER<br />\n. \"When you hear the name 'Johns Hopkins'do you<br />\n\u2014<br />\n.<br />\nthink of surgery or satellites?\" Km-luting<br />\nroster For APL<br />\nIsolated in rural Howard county, the Hopkins affiliated<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory has in the last twenty years,<br />\ndeveloped this country's most sophisticated missile and<br />\nsatellite technologies.<br />\nResearchers in the 356 acre complex, working under<br />\nan exclusive Navy contract, have done pioneer work in<br />\nguidance systems, advanced weaponry systems and satellite development.<br />\nAt present, satellite navigation systems are a major<br />\nconcern at APL. Such systems are used to guide strike<br />\nsupport ships operating in Southeast Asia.<br />\nPresently, fifty-one percent of the contracts are classified. During fiscal year 1968-69 the Laboratory published<br />\n125 classified reports from a total of 275project reports.<br />\nAlthough the emphasis on military research has not<br />\nabated, the Director of APL, Dr. Alexander Kossiakoff,<br />\nhas recently stated that the Laboratory is presently<br />\nseeking funds for non-military research. He cited cooperative programs with the Johns Hopkins School of<br />\nMedicine and the National Institutes of Health as indications of such a move. The major block to further such<br />\nprograms, claims Kossiakoff, is a lack of sufficient funding.<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory is,today, a \"problemsolving\" research complex. Established in 1942 at the<br />\nrequest of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Laboratory was asked specifically to develop<br />\n\"an influence-type anti-aircraft shell.\"<br />\nIn response researchers at the Laboratory equipped<br />\nartillery shells with a triggering device based on a proximity fuse rather than the more conventional time-fuse.<br />\nThis development increased the accuracy and the firing<br />\nspeed of Navy cannons. Such shells were used effectively against the \"buzz\" bombs of the Germans and the<br />\nJapanese kamikaze planes--both of which had previously<br />\nbeen impervious to the Allied gunnery.<br />\nThis \"problem-solving\" approach has been maintained<br />\nat the Laboratory. Dr. Richard Ellis, supervisor of the<br />\nSpace Engineering Branch of APL stated that \"APL<br />\nwill not take cut and dry development projects. We<br />\nInsist on looking at the whole problem, and evaluating<br />\nthe project.\"<br />\nEllis stated that APL retains the perogative of rejecting all proposals put forth by the Navy, the Laboratory's<br />\nsole contractor. \"We might reject a job on humane or<br />\ntechnical reasons. Maybe they're trying to solve the<br />\nwrong problem.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Just Ten Per Cent\"<br />\n\"The essential difference,\" he continued, \"between<br />\nAPL and other research organizations is our whole attitude. We ask,\"Is the thing we're deing relevant to the<br />\nproblem?' Relevancy of our work is the first criterion.\"<br />\nPresently, the research conducted at the Applied Physics Laboratory which is directly related to military developments consists of satellite research and the Fleet<br />\nAir Defense Program. Dr. Kossiakoff noted that the<br />\nFleet Air Defense work consists primarily of \"information work in on-board equipment.\" He explained that<br />\nradar and satellite tracking techniques are a major<br />\nconcern for the Navy.<br />\nDespite APL's past commitment to missile research,<br />\nKossiakoff claimed that the Laboratory presently devotes<br />\nonly ten per cent of its resources to such developments.<br />\nThe Director was, however, reluctant to discuss in any<br />\ndetail the type of unclassified military research presently being conducted at the Laboratory.<br />\n<br />\nRIM-2 Advanced Terrier supersonic ship-to-air missile designed by the APL to replace the Terrier and Tartar missile series seen in dual<br />\nlauncher on shipboard.<br />\nment.<br />\nHe would only Say that the Laboratory was engaged in<br />\nKossiakoff did state that the Laboratory will \"press in<br />\ndeveloping submarine detection methods.<br />\nthe direction of getting into the non-military area as<br />\nThe Director was considerably more willing to discuss<br />\nfast as we can get support.\" Such work presently comthe \"socially beneficial\" research being conducted at<br />\nprises only six per cent of the total research conducted<br />\nAPL. There are two major sources of such research:<br />\nat<br />\nthe Laboratory. He said, however, that there is novi<br />\nthe \"Task X Fund\" and developments resulting from<br />\nthree times the number of presently active non-military<br />\nthe technical spin-off of military research done for the<br />\nprojects approved still waiting for funding. \"I don't<br />\nNavy.<br />\nknow how the hell we're going to get to twenty per cent,\"<br />\nThe Task X Fund is the pool of money resulting from<br />\nhe added.<br />\nan overhead allowance charged the Navy for military<br />\nresearch. This independent fund is alloted to APL<br />\nresearchers for whatever basic research they wish to<br />\nconduct.<br />\n<br />\nGovernment Dictated Limits<br />\n\"To all practical purposes,\" noted Dr. Ellis, \"the<br />\nNavy is subsidizing this work (on non-military research.)\"<br />\nSpin-off from military research is an additional source<br />\nof material for socially useful projects Dr. Ellis pointed<br />\nout that the APL-developed pacemaker is powered by an<br />\nenergy source made for satellite guidance systems. The<br />\npacemaker is radically different from the proceeding<br />\ngeneration of artificial heart stimulators, as it can be<br />\nautomatically recharged thus alleviating the need for<br />\nperiodic surgical replacement which has plagued and<br />\nthreatened heart patients in the past. This new power<br />\nsource has also been incorporated into designs for prosthetic or artificial limbs.<br />\nIn line with a recent government decision, the Directors at APL have decided to temporarily accept a twenty<br />\nper cent limit on the amount of \"socially beneficial\"<br />\nresearch conducted at the Laboratory. \"We're going to<br />\nmove with the national priorities,\" stated Kossiakoff.<br />\n\"We'll use our talents to the best that is possible.\" The<br />\npriorities mentioned by Kossiakoff are set by the govern-<br />\n<br />\nPossible Cabinet Support<br />\n<br />\nKossiakoff noted that the government is presently<br />\ntrying to publicize the benefits of research centers like<br />\nthe Applied Physics Laboratory to cabinet members.<br />\nSecretary of State Melvin Laird has recently written<br />\nto all cabinet members advising - them that APL and<br />\nsimilar research centers may provide answers to some<br />\nof their most difficult problems. Among those who have<br />\nalready responded are The Department of the Interior,<br />\nThe Department of Transportation and HEW.<br />\n\"We'll push on to twenty per cent,\" stated Kossiakoff,<br />\nand if we reach it we'll fall back, regroup and consider<br />\nwhat to do.\"<br />\nIt is certain that if the Laboratory is ever faced with<br />\nthe possibility of exceeding the government's twenty per<br />\ncent limit on non-military research at APL, such decisions will be made with The Department of Defense.<br />\nBoth Kossiakoff and Ellis noted that all equipment at<br />\nthe Laboratory belongs to the Navy.<br />\nThe Laboratory is free to use that equipment in any<br />\nway it desires so long as the contract with the Department of the Navy is not terminated. The director agreed<br />\nthat to force the issue with the Navy would jeopardize<br />\nthe existing projects.<br />\nKossiakoff added that \"we feel we should move in<br />\nthese directions (towards non-military research) not because military research is useless or somehow bad but<br />\njust that other problems are becoming important. As<br />\nmore important things arise we'll sluff off the less important things.\"<br />\n<br />\nSocially Beneficial Research<br />\n<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County was established in 1942 to develop \"an influence type anti aircraft shell.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe initial search for non-military projects has been<br />\nin a variety of directions. APL now has cooperative<br />\nprograms with the Hopkins School of Medicine and the<br />\nHopkins' Center for Urban Affairs, as well as a research<br />\nevaluation project with the Department of Transportation.<br />\nWorking with the Center for Urban Affairs, the Laboratory has initiated a program designed to apply spaceage technology and physical sciences to the problems<br />\nassociated with large urban centers. Working in conjunction with Hopkins' faculty members, APL researchers are presently sorting programs having national significance.<br />\nAmong those areas designated for study are waste<br />\ncontrol, industrial housing, utilization of sewage wastes<br />\nas well as possible means of modeling urban systems<br />\nand control of thermal pollution.<br />\nAPL is also involved in evaluating the technological<br />\nfeasibility of various transportation plans for the Urban<br />\nMass Transportation Administration.

Over four and a half years,<br />\nthe Laboratory and Medical School have cooperated<br />\nin such fields as nuclear medicine ophthalmology, biomedical engineering, radiography, cardio-vascular systems and the delivery of health systems.<br />\nThis has led APL to develop techniques in areas of<br />\ninstrumentation, theoretical modeling, systems engineering and simulation and technique development.<br />\nThree-Dimensional X-Rays<br />\nOne result of this cooperation is a three-dimensional<br />\nX-ray system allowing for a fast and thorough study of<br />\nPatients. The system includes a series of twenty, conventional X-ray pictures which when projected into an<br />\nempty spance form a three-dimensional image of the<br />\noriginal subject. By passing a viewing screen through<br />\nthe image, cross sections of the image may be examined.<br />\nBY rotating and translating the screen any desired<br />\nPlane within the image may be examined.<br />\nThis system, stated Dr. David G. Grant, developer<br />\nof the apparatus, allows the doctor to view internal<br />\nstructures from any angle, even those which might<br />\nnormally by obscured in conventional X-rays.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Kossiakoff noted that such developments are<br />\nnecessarily limited due to the shortage of funds. He<br />\nsaid that APL was able to engage in such work only because of its very free relationship with the Navy. \"Other<br />\nagencies just don't have the equipment we've got,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nThere are additional reasons why more money cannot<br />\nbe poured into socially useful projects. Kossiakoff<br />\nstated that it is APL's task to develop increasingly<br />\ncomplex weaponry systems. \"Since World War II the<br />\nmilitary technology has gotten to such a point that any<br />\nnafion that wants to, can make weapons so dreadful<br />\nthat unless you maintain yourself on a reasonably equal<br />\nfooting, you'll be at the mercy of other nations.\"<br />\nWhile recognizing the potential over-kill capability of<br />\ntoday's superpowers, the Director argued that such conditions lead only a temporary stalemate\" and you can't<br />\npredict how long it will continue.\"<br />\n\"We're actively working to achieve peace,\" he observed, \"and how you do that depends on your history.<br />\nMost of us have lived through the last war and we're<br />\nacutely aware of what the Chinese and Russians have<br />\ndone.\" Kossiakoff added that he has seen no change in<br />\n<br />\nTabs nuclear-warhead missiles on shipboard launcher. The Tabs<br />\nprogram resulted from the Bumblebee research program initiated<br />\nby APL.<br />\n<br />\nman's relations since the 1940s.<br />\nWhen asked why the Applied Physics Laboratory's<br />\nrecruiting emphasized solely military research, however, Kossiakoff replied \"we don't want to give people<br />\ncoming here the idea that they can immediately work on<br />\nsocially significant research. We don't want to create<br />\nthe illusion that APL is one hundred per cent for socially<br />\n<br />\nAPL has its own Principal Staff, acting as the Deans of<br />\nthe other Divisons, who are answerable solely to the<br />\nTrustees. The Principal Staff and the Trustees are the<br />\nmajor policy making body for the Applied Physics Laboratory.<br />\nDr. Kossiakoff stated that the benefits of this system<br />\nare \"primarily intangible\". Noting that the University<br />\nis legally responsible for the Laboratory, Kossiakoff<br />\nsaid that the relationship acts as an umbrella and means<br />\nof protecting the research complex from governmental<br />\ninfluences.<br />\nSim ilarily, the Laboratory gains through close association with the University divisions such as the School of<br />\nMedicine. Such a relationship allows each section to tap<br />\nthe resources of the other. \"We've developed a very potent team,\" said Kossiakoff.<br />\nIn a private interview with the News-Letter last week,<br />\nDr. Gordon stated that \"If (APL) did not exist today and<br />\nsomeone came to us and asked that it be established, I<br />\nthink it unlikely that the approach would be accepted.\"<br />\nHe added, however, that the reason for keeping the primarily classified research complex on campus is for<br />\nthe University to benefit from the interrelationships.<br />\nAPL staff, while holding appointments at Hopkins do<br />\nnot have tenure.<br />\nThe relation with the University has left the Applied<br />\nPhysics Laboratory in a unique position. Kossiakoff<br />\nstated that the Laboratory is neither a University research center nor equivalent to private industry.<br />\n\"In any job we've been asked to do, if we think it can<br />\nbe done equally well by private organizations or by private industry, we will not except it. We do not compete<br />\nwith private industry.\"<br />\n\"When we take a job,\" he continued, \"we are the best<br />\nqualified to do it.\"<br />\n<br />\nuseful work.\"<br />\nSince 1942 APL has operated under a single Government contract, administered by the Navy. This contract,<br />\nan administration convenience, funnels all funds into the<br />\nLaboratory. As outside groups, such as the National<br />\nInstitutes of Health, have specific problems to propose<br />\nto the Laboratory, they approach the Navy who, in turn,<br />\ndirects them to APL. In this way all work done at APLs<br />\nNavy contracted and under Navy control.<br />\nActing as mediators between the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory and the Navy, there are a series of research<br />\nsponsors. These sponsors are primarily concerned<br />\nwith negotiating arrangements for contract work or for<br />\nfinding outside interests for developments made as part<br />\nof the technical spin off from military research.<br />\nFrom its conception the research complex has operated on a no-gain-no-loss basis. Because of this policy,<br />\nincome collected from the small fee charged on all contract work is placed in the APL Stabilization and Contingency Fund.<br />\nThis fund provides protection against major cost disallowances provides for the payment of the principle<br />\nexecutives of the Laboratory,for non-reimbursable costs<br />\nand provides a reserve in the event of termination of the<br />\nLaboratory's operations.<br />\nNone of the University's general or endownment funds<br />\nhave been used to support the Laboratory.<br />\nAdministratively, the Laboratory is completely independent from the University. Like all Hopkins' divisions,<br />\n<br />\nDr. Alexander Kossiakoff, Director of the APL: \"We will press<br />\nin the direction of getting into the non-military area as fast as<br />\nwe can get support.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br />\n<br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br />\nTailoring, Repairing, Dying<br />\n<br />\nST.

Technology is for human<br />\nuse, and every<br />\nenterprise has to have its needs, goals and aspirations<br />\nconstantly reviewed.\"<br />\n<br />\nDr. George Wald, a Nobel Prize winner and peace<br />\nmovement leader, will speak on April 9 at the School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies (SAIS)in Washington,D.C.<br />\nDr. Wald, the Higgins Professor of Biology at Harvard,<br />\nwill speak on \"Man and Machine: Prospect for Human<br />\nEnterprise\" at 8 p.m. Wald packed Shriver Hall last Octdber as the keynote speaker in the Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium on the Military.<br />\nHis speech is part of a series on \"Computers, Communications and the Public Interest\" sponsored by Hopkins and the Brookings Institute. Anyone interested in<br />\ntaking a free bus down to the speech should contact Dr.<br />\nGreenberger at Ext. 895.<br />\nDr. Wald first came into national prominence after a<br />\nMarch 4, 1969 speech at MIT during a research stoppage<br />\nprotest. The speech was an eloquent, moving plea against<br />\nmilitarism and war. Its impact was so overwhelming<br />\nthat today it is still known as simply \"The Speech.\" It<br />\nwas reprinted in full in the New Yorker and other magazines and Dr. Wald's name became a household world.<br />\n<br />\nHampton House: Disapointment, Disgust, Apathy<br />\nThe following article was written by Nannette Woolcock<br />\nfrom the Hopkins Nursing School (Hampton House).<br />\nAlthough the story was edited, its content remains<br />\nunchanged.<br />\nDisappointment, disgust, misunderstanding,low morale<br />\nand apathy seem to describe the atmosphere surrounding<br />\nthe students of the Hopkins School of Nursing. With emotions at a peak, most students have decided that some sort<br />\nof action must be taken with regard to their lack of communication with the administration.<br />\nThe crisis has culminated in the refusal of the executivefaculty committee to grant the students' request for a fourday weekend at Easter. In January the students petitioned<br />\nfor an extra day and supported this demand by what they<br />\nconsidered reasonable arguments.<br />\nAt the time other requests were made concerning graduation and the dress code. Only the dress code changes requested by the students were accepted. No official notification was given to the student body concerning the request<br />\n.for an extended holiday.<br />\nAccording to one instructor, the freshman class has<br />\n\"reacted in an abnormal way to stress.\" The class of '72<br />\nhas already received more social regulation changes and<br />\nhas apparently demanded more personalized attention than<br />\nhave previous classes.<br />\nFacts indicating student inability to cope with<br />\nthe<br />\nanxiety-producing situations peculiar to a nursing<br />\neducation are: approximately 70 percent of the class<br />\nof '69<br />\nsought Psychiatric Counceling, according to one<br />\ninstructor; the class of '70, once 83 in number, is now<br />\nhoping to<br />\ngraduate 49;the junior class,once 81 strong,has diminished to 50.<br />\n<br />\nTo many students the controversy over the four-day<br />\nweekend symbolizes the underlying discontent of the student body, and its feeling that communication with the<br />\nadministration is lacking. This idea is embodied in a second petition, to be submitted for consideration.Some students, particularly juniors, feel the need to go directly<br />\nto Mrs. Price, the Director of Nursing,and express their<br />\ndisappointment and hopes that satisfactory action can be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nThe reasons behind the students' continued appeal are:<br />\nthey are tired; the extra day is of no academic signifigance<br />\nsince grades will be handed in by March 24; four days<br />\nwould make traveling much less strenuous; it is a religious<br />\nholiday for a majority of the students; and it is the end of a<br />\nsemester. Some administratorsfind these reasons unconvincing. As one has remarked, \"You knew nursing was<br />\ngoing to be tough when you came. If you can't take it,<br />\nleave.\"<br />\nThe students have voiced reactions against such attitudes. One student, Michele Cawley, stated, \"We should be<br />\ntreated as individuals and can no longer tolerate being<br />\nvictims of an impenetrable system.\" A senior student<br />\nmentioned the fact that \"We're tired of swallowing everything, and we're ready to vomit.\"<br />\nAt one point there had been discussion by a number of<br />\nangry students over the possibility of not showing up for<br />\nwork on March 26, after proper notification of the clinical<br />\nareas involved. Other students were finally roused to<br />\nmeet and discuss other less dramatic but equally effective<br />\nways to express their dissatisfaction. Plans for immediate establishment of better and more mature lines of<br />\ncommunication are underway.<br />\n<br />\nFORUM<br />\nON<br />\nUNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE<br />\n<br />\nThe speech gave him a fame that his Nobel Prize in<br />\nMedicine and Psychology has never gained for him. The<br />\nNew York TimesMagazineSectiondidalengthyfeature story<br />\non Dr. Wald, who has since become an important figure<br />\nin the peace movement.<br />\nIn an interview with the News-Letter, Dr. Wald discussed technology, the environment, and politics.<br />\nDr. Wald speaks in the same thoughtful style that marks<br />\nhis speeches. Referring to his upcomimg speech on<br />\ncomputers, Wald commented, \"The computers are hurting culture.\" He continued, \"Creativity is suffering, and<br />\nthe life of the scientist is being degraded. Some may<br />\nspeak of computers writing poetry or making music, but<br />\nart is going down-hill.\"<br />\nWald is worried about the directions technology appears to be taking. \"We need,\" he stated, \"a complete<br />\nchange in the way technology develops. Technology is for<br />\nhuman use, and every enterprise has to have its needs,<br />\ngoals and aspirations constantly reviewed.\"<br />\nDr. Wald would like to see a wholesale revision in Our<br />\nattitudes toward technology and production. \"We all too<br />\ncommonly take for granted what we can do, rather than<br />\nwhat we should do.\" He is not, however, as wary about<br />\nscience as he is about technology. He stressed, \"Science<br />\nis about knowing and understanding, and it is inherentlY<br />\ngood. Technology, though, can be good or bad, depending<br />\non what we do with it.\"<br />\nWald charged that \"too many of these important technological decisions are made only by the producers. we<br />\nin<br />\nneed<br />\ncareful and constant intrusion of the public<br />\n\"It will pollute the air, it will give us a disastrous<br />\nsonic boom. And to what end? So some jet-setters can<br />\nget across the Atlantic a few hours faster.\"<br />\nWald views the environmental crisis with a curious<br />\nmlexture of despair and hopd; \"This is the crisis of<br />\ncrises,\" he said. \"We are now,\" he continued, \"at the<br />\ncrossroads: We have either the chance to survive or the<br />\nthreat of perishing. This is both a threat and an opportunity.\" He noted, \"Unfortunately, only when something<br />\nhas become critical are large numbers of people shaken<br />\nout of their apathy.\"<br />\nHe welcomes all the recent concern about the environment, but he warns that we must avoid some major pitfalls. \"We can't let the environment distract us from<br />\nother major problems like the war and poverty, and we<br />\nhave to be prepared to deal with the major interests who<br />\nwill be affected by a real attack on environmental problems.\" He added, \"We must go to the source, and so<br />\nwe are going to be stepping on some pretty important<br />\ntoes.\"<br />\nWald places a lot of faith in youth. \"Winter has been<br />\ncold to demonstrations, but when spring comes, the kids<br />\nwill be out in the streets again. And that's the way policy<br />\nshould be made--it's better than having it made in the<br />\noffices of Lockheed and General Motors.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Old Homestead.<br />\n<br />\nAre you satisfied, dissatisfied or apathetic with YOUR university's governance?

The group present endorsed the University<br /><br />\nSenate concept as one way to improve University governance. Other subjects discussed were the elimination of<br />\ngrades and attempts to make Homewood courses more<br /><br />\nStudents, Faculty Asked<br />\nTo Meet on Governance<br />\nCiting a need to create \"an atmosphere of trust\" between faculty and<br />\nstudents, the Student Council has called for a meeting of the SC and the faculty on the governance issue.<br />\nIn a letter sent to all faculty members, the SC claimed that \"university<br />\ngovernance at the Jonns Hopkins University must be a joint effort of the students and the faculty.\" This joint effort,<br />\nthe letter implied, was being hampered<br />\nby a lack of understanding and cornmunication between students and faculty. The SC hopes to help remedy<br />\nthis lack through the student-faculty<br />\nmeeting, planned for today at four o'clock in Levering Hall.<br />\nJohn Guess, President of the Student<br />\nCouncil, views the meeting as a forum<br />\nwhere both students and faculty will<br />\nbe able to present their opinions on the<br />\ngovernance<br />\nissue<br />\nand \"hopefully,<br />\nbridge the communication gap.\"<br />\nAnother goal of the meeting, suggested Guess, would be to ease what he feels<br />\nIs an attitude of mutual student-faculty<br />\nmistrust. Guess stated that this mistrust would have to end before students<br />\nand faculty could work together on the<br />\ngovernance issue. \"If there can't be any<br />\ntrust now, there won't be any trust<br />\nlater,\" he commented.<br />\nConcrete Action<br />\nGuess indicated that he would also<br />\nlike to see some concrete action resulting from the meeting. He and the<br />\nSC want the Faculty General Assembly<br />\nto issue a new charge to the present ad<br />\nhoc Committee on Governance, directing it to study and recommend procedures to deal with the present dissatisfaction with the governance system.<br />\nThe Governance Committee, chaired by Dr. Woodford Howard, is presently charged only with determining<br />\nwhether \"widespread dissatisfaction\"<br />\nexists with the system. If it finds such<br />\ndissatisfaction, it will be up to a second<br />\ncommittee to recommend changes.<br />\nGuess proposed that this two-step<br />\nprocess be condensed into one. He<br />\nclaimed that the duly elected represen-<br /><br />\ntatives of both undergraduate and graduate students bad already expressed<br />\ngreat dissatisfaction with the governance process, thus making the Howard<br />\nCommittee's task somewhat unnecessary.<br /><br />\nGalvanize Forces<br />\nStating that \"most representatives<br />\nin the governance system feel that just<br />\nto identify the problem is not enough,\"<br />\nGuess hopes to \"galvanize forces to<br />\nget a special Faculty General Assembly meeting called, because it's the<br />\nonly way to get the committee recharged.\"<br />\nGuess also suggested that since the<br />\nCommittee had done all the preliminary work in investigating the issue, it<br />\nshould also complete the investigation.<br />\n\"Given the wealth of information before the Committee, they should be the<br />\nones to try to find answers,\" commented Guess.<br />\nGuess claimed that he had tried to<br />\nset up an official meeting with the Faculty General Assembly through Dr.<br />\nMichael Beer, its Vice-Cha'rman, in<br />\nlate February. Such a meeting was<br />\nactually planned, said Guess, but was<br />\nsubsequently cancelled by Beer.<br />\nIn response, Beer stated that he<br />\nhad originally consented to such a meeting. He later discovered, however,that<br />\nGuess had not consulted the Howard<br />\ncommittee about the proposed meeting. After telling Guess to talk to the<br />\nCommittee about it, Beer said that he<br />\nhad heard no more.<br />\nDisagreeing with Guess, Beer felt<br />\nthat \"it isn't clear\" that governance<br />\n\"Is a burning issue in the minds of<br />\nstudents.\" He intimated that he was<br />\ntotally satisfied with the progress of<br />\nthe Governance Committee,stating that<br />\n\"things are moving along at as healthy<br />\na pace as can be expected.\"<br />\nBeer also disagreed with Guess'<br />\nclaims that the two-step, two-committee investigation of the governance<br />\nwas time-consuming. Remarked Beer,<br />\n\"I think that these issues are important enough to be considered carefully.\"<br /><br />\n\"relevant.\" Nothing was decided by the participants.<br />\nThe faculty Committee on Governance will be holding<br />\ntheir own Open Forum next , Tuesday night,<br /><br />\nGrad GovernanceForum<br />\nAttracts SmallAudience<br />\nA scant 25 people showed up at the<br />\nGarrett Room of the library Wednesday night for the Graduate Student Organization's Open Forum on Governance.<br />\nAt the informal meeting, the discussion on the governance question rapidly<br />\nevolved into a more general consideration of the nature of a \"community of<br />\nscholars,\" dealing mainly with what<br />\nwas termed the student's \"impotent\"<br />\nrelationship to the University.<br />\nSuggesting ways to solve this problem, those present supported a concerted effort in favor of a University<br />\nSenate, although this was only one of<br />\nmany possible methods proposed for<br />\nImproving the student's relationship to<br />\nthe University.<br /><br />\nElimination of Grades<br /><br />\nuniversity hierarchy.<br />\nAn appeal was also made for students to attempt to persuade faculty<br />\nmembers to make courses more \"relevant\" and more personal. Mrs.<br />\nFankhauser pointed out that the knowledge a student is seeking is only a<br />\ntool which he can use later in dealing<br />\nwith his own problems. She agreed<br />\nthat, were professors to describe their<br />\nown experiences in finding the solution<br />\nto questions, the student would benefit<br />\nmuch more than by knowing what the<br />\nquestion was and what the \"correct\"<br />\nanswer eventually turned out to be.<br /><br />\nWhat's the Goal<br />\nThe goal of a university education<br />\nwas also given a good deal of consideration. A number of those at the<br />\nmeeting felt that higher education had<br />\nbecome simply a means of obtaining<br />\na better paycheck. This, it was pointed out, was entirely incompatible with<br />\nthe theoretical purpose of education<br />\nbut not at all in opposition to the social<br />\nstandards of white, middle-class<br />\nAmerica.<br /><br />\nAmong these proposals was the<br />\nelimination of the grade standard, replacing it with either a pass-fail system or abolishing it all together. It<br />\nwas suggested that while the student,<br />\ncramming his head with the knowledge<br />\nof the professor, is learning facts, he<br />\nis not thinking--or learning to think.<br />\nJill Fankhauser, a graduate student at Hopkins and the leader of most<br />\nof the meeting, stated that the student<br />\nhas been so indoctrinated that he believes \"if he licks enough boots he<br />\nwill someday be free.\" Another graduate student asserted that not only<br />\nuniversity administrators<br />\ndo \"the<br />\nand faculty treat the students as inferiors, but they themselves feel inferior.\"<br /><br />\nFurther, it was observed, the very<br />\nstandards upon which admission to and<br />\nsuccess in a university are founded<br />\nare also those of this social stratum<br />\nIn a sense, since the situation has become self-perpetuating.<br /><br />\nRepeated reference was made to the<br />\nrecent suspension of an undergraduate<br />\nfor taking several dollars worth of<br />\nbooks from the book store.

However<br />\nhe feels his department will have<br />\nto limit the number of new students it accepts.<br /><br />\nAssociate Dean for Administration Robert L.

It<br />\nis hoped that special restrictive<br />\ngrants made to individual departments<br />\nand corporate awards<br />\nwould provide some relief, though<br />\nhardly the $610,000 which the<br />\n122 awards represents.<br /><br />\nDr. Robert Parr, Chairman of<br />\nthe Chemistry Department, plans<br />\nto admit about the same number<br />\nof new graduate students next<br />\nyear as it did this past year.

Dr.<br />\nPeter Achinstein, Chairman of<br />\nthe Philosophy Department, plans<br /><br />\nmake it necessary for many departments at Homewood to decrease admissions of new graduate students or to cut down on<br />\nsupport to current students.<br /><br />\ndual professors in the department to divert their research<br />\nfrom post-doctoral to<br />\ngrants<br />\ndoctoral students. Parr also hoped for an increase in competition<br />\nfellowships, such as the National<br />\nInstitute of Health grants.<br /><br />\nUnlikely Alternatives<br />\nThese possibilities seem unlikely. Dr. Bevan has received<br />\ninformation to the effect that<br />\nNIH grants are expected to be<br />\nrenewed at only 50% of the current level. Such a turn of events<br />\nwould be of particular concern<br />\nto the biology department, the<br />\nmajority of whose graduate students are currently receiving<br />\nNIH grants. Dean Strider also<br />\nindicated that federal grants for<br />\nfaculty research assistants would<br />\nalso decrease.<br />\nStrider said that the main priority in deciding how many grants<br />\nto award to each department was<br />\nsupport of junior instructors and<br />\nteaching assistants needed to<br />\nteach sections of undergraduate<br />\ncourses. This becomes an even<br />\ngreater priority as the undergraduate body is continually increased.<br /><br />\nPh. D. Surplus<br />\nDean Robert Strider reported a total drop in federal awards from 1968-69<br />\nto 1970-71 of 122.\"When this money is pulled out, you just cannot sustain<br />\nthe graduate school at the same level\"\u2022<br /><br />\nThe \"Ph.D surplus\" has been<br />\nused by politicians to justify the<br />\ndrying up of funds, Strider feels.<br />\nHe sees government policy as a<br /><br />\nself-fulfilling prophecy: the government cuts funds for post doctoral research, which leaves<br />\nmany Ph.D's with no way to continue their research.The government then says that there are too<br />\nmany Ph.D's and not enough jobs<br />\nin post-doctoral research to go<br />\naround.<br />\nDr. Achinstein feels that<br />\n\"pressure will be put onthe government to relent. Such techniques have succeeded in the past...<br />\nThe government is taking a very<br />\nshort-sighted view.\" He also<br /><br />\npointed to the effect of the cutbacks on the undergraduate body:<br />\nthe less money granted to graduate students by the government,<br />\nthe more money the university<br />\nwill have to divert to them,and the<br />\nless money the university will<br />\nhave for undergraduates.<br />\nThe outlook for 1971-72 seems<br />\neven bleaker than that for the<br />\ncoming year. NSF has announced that it will make no new awards<br />\nfor 1971-72.

He said he immediately<br />\narranged the meeting scheduled for this<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nChuck Fax, one of the two undergraduates sitting on the cammittee,gave the<br />\nfollowing account of events inthe Student<br />\nCouncil leading up to the meeting. Early<br />\nin September the SC interviewed \"seven<br />\nor eight\" candidates for the committee<br />\npositions. Two men were choosen: Fax,<br />\na-senior, and Marvin Kopp,a ,freshman.<br />\nSC president John Guess, who made the<br />\nchoices subject to the Council's approval,<br />\nwas apparently unaware that under a recent amendment to the SC constitution<br />\nthe president of that body was automatically seated on the student relations<br />\ncommittee, leaving only one vacant position to be filled.<br />\nMills was never informed of the deci-<br /><br />\nSAC Governance Proposal Given<br />\nThe Student Affairs Committee formulated Wednesday a twelve -point revision to Dr. George Owen's proposal on<br />\nUniversity governance.<br />\nEight of the revision's twelve points<br />\ndeal with the SAC's recommendations for<br />\nthe formation of the proposed University<br />\nSenate, and, in general, they provide<br />\nmethods of getting the Senate into operation as quickly as possible.<br />\nThe remaining four segments relate<br />\nthe SAC's opinions on the desirability<br />\nof the Senate, the necessity of its functions as a meeting place for students<br />\nand faculty, the stake of the University<br />\nin theSenate's formation and the departmental grouping for faculty elections.<br />\nOn the last point,the SAC recommended grouping related departments to elect<br />\nthe faculty members to the Senate. The<br />\nopinion of the Committee was that Dr.<br />\nOwen's original proposal, made last<br />\nSeptember, discriminated against certain departments.<br />\nUndergraduate member Chris Ohly<br />\nnoted that Owen placed the Humanistic<br />\nStudies faculty on equal footing with<br /><br />\nthe Earth and Planetary Sciences department, even though there are many<br />\nmore professors in the Humanities area.<br />\nThe chairman of the Student Relations<br />\nCommittee, Dr. John White of Art History, declared that the SAC's plan was<br />\nnot intended to undercut Owen's University Senate proposal. The only part<br />\nof the Committee's proposal that directly contradicts the Owen plan is their<br />\nrecommendation against Owen's grouping of the faculty into the six departmental areas.<br />\nThe SAC's position on this point grew<br />\nout of a suggestion by undergraduate<br />\nStuart Seidel that the Senate be composed of equal numbers of faculty and students, with a set number of professors<br />\nbeing chosen by each department. Fifty<br />\nper cent of the students would be graduates and fifty per cent undergraduates.<br /><br />\nDepartmental Pressure<br />\nIn the debate that followed, graduate<br />\nSAC member Richard Conviser noted<br /><br />\nthat such a system could be representative. He remarked that the voting for<br />\nthe offices in the Graduate Student Organization rarely was divided along departmental lines.<br />\nDr. White pointed out, however, that<br />\ndepartmental pressures on grad students<br />\ncould reasonably be expected to be less<br />\nthan on members of the departments,<br />\nand that decisions for a department as<br />\nlarge as Physics, for example, could<br />\ninvolve \"literally millions of dollars,\"<br />\nthus increasing pressure.<br />\nOhly and Seidel expressed the opinion<br />\nthat White's objection was irrelevant,<br />\nsince important intra-departmental decisions are not to be in the domain of<br />\nthe University Senate. Faculty representative Alex Sotir claimed that these<br />\nconsiderations of voting divisions were<br />\nprobably not as important as the essential need of the Senate for people with a<br />\nworking knowledge of the topics to be<br />\nconsidered.<br /><br />\nsion of the Student Council, and assumed<br />\nthat no appointments had been made. He<br />\nclaimed that he tried to contact Guess<br />\n\"on several occasions,\" but had no success.<br />\nDr. Harvey Woolf of History of Science,<br />\nwho has been on the committee since its<br />\nInception, stated flatly, \"I'm on so many<br />\ncommittees that haven't met,I never gave<br />\nIt a thought.\" Dean Carl Swanson, who<br />\nclaimed that he attends \"seven or eight<br />\ncommittee meetings a week\" was unconcerned. \"I have enough committee meetings already without engendering another<br />\none just for the sake of having it.\"<br /><br />\nLetters and Lists<br />\nGuess stated that he had received two<br />\nseparate letters from Mills asking him<br />\nto submit the names of committee members. Immediately following the first of<br />\nthese, the president submitted his appointments to Dean Allyn Kimball's office. Kimball is responsible for the formal organization of the committee system. Mill's second letter to Guess was<br />\nignored. These transactions were completed at the end of October and the beginning of November.<br />\nTwo weeks ago, following an NewsLetter expose of the failures of the committee system, Guess was contacted by<br />\nBruce Hammil, assistant to Kimball.<br />\nApparently engaged in making up the long<br />\nawaited list of community members for<br />\nall the Academic Council's committees,<br />\nhe asked which two of the three SC nominees were to sit onthe Student Relations<br />\nCommittee. Guess named himself and<br />\nFax, excluding Marvin Kopp because he<br />\nfelt that Fax was more \"experienced.\"<br />\nAccording to GS0 president Bob Cotter,<br />\nthe names of the two graduate student<br />\nappointees were approved and transmitted to \"everybody (he) could think of.\"<br />\nThis included Kimball, Bilgrave, Swanson, and Mills, among others.

Ninety-four<br />\nyears later, somebody else has come up with another<br />\none and if it catches on, it might be good for another<br />\ncentury or so.<br />\nStudent-run seminar courses that are conducted with<br />\nminimal, if any, faculty supervision are slowly being<br />\nestablished. The English Department sponsors one that<br /><br />\nhas been successful. The Carl Jung seminar in the<br />\nPsychology Department proves that these attempts are<br />\nnot freak occurences.<br />\nThe Jung seminar owes its existence to the enthusiasm<br />\nof Gerry O'Dell, a senior with a concentration in psychology.<br />\nLast semester, O'Dell approached Assistant Psychology Professor Robert Hogan with his plan, and received<br />\napproval. Over the intersession, he recruited six people who would be interested in taking the class, though,<br />\nsince then, the number has swelled to twelve.<br /><br />\nTwo Papers<br />\nO'Dell gave six introductory lectures and reading assignments on Jung. Students were obliged to do two<br />\npapers concerning some phase of Jung's writings.<br />\nOne problem that has risen has been the inavailability of guest lecturers. There are very few Jungian<br />\ntherapists on the East Coast and no funds are accessible<br />\nto pay their high fees.<br />\nIn order to avoid the administrative red tape involved in setting up a new course, the students are signed<br />\nup for independent study under Professor Hogan. Hogan,in turn, has given over all responsibility to O'Dell. Grades<br />\nare determined on the basis of two papers. If the papers<br />\naren't done, credit will not be given.<br />\nThe class<br />\nmeets once a week for two hours in a<br />\nseminar room in Ames Hall. No faculty members are<br />\npresent. Attendance is usually very good. As for the<br />\natmosphere of the class, David Levien, one of those<br />\nparticipating, comments, \"Everyone takes the course<br />\nseriously and it is of fairly high quality. People sometimes get into very animated discussions--even into<br />\nfights.\"<br /><br />\nDr. Robert Hogan is the sponsor of Psychology's new course<br />\nrun by students. The course features a detailed summary of<br />\nthe theories of Carl Jung.<br /><br />\nO'Dell is optimistic about the future of such seminars. \"Class sizes have increased to the dehumanizing level. Since Hopkins can't afford to hire new<br />\nfaculty, student seminars could prove to be an alternative.\"<br />\n\"I don't have teaching skills. But I think that I get<br />\nmore done then some professors do in big lectures.\"<br />\nLevien agrees. \"I am very satisfied and pleased\",<br />\nhe says \"that the intellectual level of Hopkins could be<br />\nraised. A kid who spends a semester preparing a course<br />\ncares more than a professor.\" At Hopkins there's a lot<br />\nof freedom to do this sort of thing. Whatever you want to<br />\ndo you can and probably get credit for it, if you use your<br />\nhead.\"<br /><br />\nIn a Monday night meeting at Levering Hall, Larry Goldberg (rt.)<br />\nand other participants in yesterday's sit-in discussed their strategy.<br /><br />\nBail Ordered Dropped<br />\n(Continuedfrom page 4)<br />\nSeveral minutes of good-natured negotiations with<br />\nMajor Schaubel of the Baltimore City Police followed.<br />\nSchaubel first threatened the demonstrators with arrest<br />\non charges of blocking the sidewalk,but then allowed them<br />\nto move in front of the entrance to the Customs House,<br />\non the condition that they leave a pathway on the sidewalk clear.<br />\nThe participants sat there for several more minutes,<br />\nagain blocking access to the draft board.

As of yet, no speaker has been found for the next and final<br />\nnight.

Originally<br />\nthought of as a substitute for coeducation, it is thought that it will still be<br />\nuseful due to the fact that only a small<br />\nnumber of women will be admitted in the<br />\nnext few years and current reports indicate<br />\nthat most of them will be science-oriented.

Of course, we must applaud the direct, unequivocal opposition expressed to the draft; but this has been done many<br />\ntimes before in many places. The significance of yesterday's demonstration lies in who participated. Sponsored by the Moratorium Committee<br />\nand openly supported by former McCarthy and Kennedy backers, people<br />\nwho still believe in \"the system\" yesterday marked a militant turn in<br />\nliberal politics in America. By sitting-in, the liberals did what the radicals<br />\nwere up to three or four years ago, radicals that are today engaged in<br />\nopenly revolutionary activities. Mr. Nixon had better learn that an increasing number of Americans are getting tired, tired of all the bullshit. At the<br />\nsit-in Assistant U. S. Attorney Alan Barron told the demonstrators that<br />\nhis views on the war were irrelevant, and so he ordered the doorway<br />\ncleared. People have to be willing to put something on the line to accomplish anything, whether it be their arrest record, their jobs, or their lives.<br />\nAn increasing number of people are realizing that. Not only is it Mr.<br />\nNixon's war, but it's also Mr. Nixon's country, and unless we see some<br />\nbasic changes in policy, it's going to be torn apart at the seams.<br /><br />\nOn \"Compulsory Studenthood\"<br />\nIt is indeed comforting to know that President Gordon recognizes the<br />\nproblems inherent in a national system which requires of its young people<br />\nthat they remain in school, whether they want to or not. \"Compulsory<br />\nstudenthood\" may be a national problem, but Dr. Gordon seems unwilling<br />\nto adjust at the local level.<br />\nIn a speech this week at the University of Hawaii, Dr. Gordon conceded that faculties \"have been remiss in undergraduate teaching\" and \"adapting higher education\" to the consequences of rapid social and technological<br />\nchange. Yet last year at Homewood, Gordon urged that undergraduates<br />\ninterested in being taught by faculty members interested in teaching, not<br />\njust conducting research, should go to a place like Amherst. Reluctantly,<br />\nhe then conceded that the undergraduate body might be a \"good thing\" as<br />\na \"junior partner\" in the University.<br />\nDr. Gordon recognizes the unfairness of employment practices which<br />\nrequire students, not otherwise intellectually motivated, to go directly<br />\nfrom high school to college and stay. there. He questions the wisdom of<br />\na national policy of higher education for all, but, from his actions on this<br />\ncampus, we feel that he is unwilling to come to grips with the immediate<br />\nproblem of how to improve the lot of those caught in the \"lockstep\"<br />\nsystem, now.<br />\n, He says that \"the ideal would be an open system of ordinary employment, backed by a governmentally-financed system of universal opportun-<br /><br />\nMy signature on this page indicates that I agree to abide by all rules<br />\nand regulations of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Applied Physics Laboratory,<br />\nand subject myself to any search or<br />\ndetention necessary for protection of<br />\ninformation or property.<br />\nSuch was our greeting at APL. After<br />\nsigning the above pledge, we were greeted by Richard Ellis, a division director<br />\nand his ever-smiling sidekick.<br />\nOur tour was in historical order.<br />\nIt traced APL's inception during World War II as a missile-development<br />\nthrough its expansion into<br />\nfactory<br />\nsatellite research in the late '50's and<br />\nnow its 3-dimensional pictures, mass<br />\ntransportation, schemes and plans to<br />\nhelp the blind see.<br />\nIt was also incredibly fast-paced; we<br />\nsaw more equipment, talked to more employees and heard more scientific explanations than anyone could have wished<br />\nin 3 hours.<br />\nEverything was straight and serious,<br />\nwith the creases of determination etched<br />\non all faces. But as is true after speeding for years, their perception is distorted. They have muscles without a<br />\nheart, brilliant brains and underdeveloped souls.<br />\nThe men of APL will just shake their<br />\nheads and sigh at the above observation.<br />\n'Immature, idealistic kids ungrateful<br />\nafter receiving a tour without a hitch'-indeed a tour so perfect that there wasn't<br />\neven time to question the employees about<br />\ntheir life outside the sparkling, whitewashed corridors or the thoughts inside<br />\ntheir dark-hued suits.<br /><br />\n\"We wouldn't like to be as weak as<br />\nHungary,\" shouted a red-faced man in<br />\nhis late fifties. In fact, they were all in<br />\ntheir late fifties, these men who run the<br />\nAPL.<br />\nThere were seven of them in their large<br />\ncarpeted board room, with one wall jammed with portraits of the present and past<br />\nmen of the laboratory.

Jerry Garcia<br />\nis still with the Grateful Dead but has lately been making<br />\na reputation for himself as a traveling pedal steel guitar<br />\nplayer (see Volunteers, by the Jefferson Airplane). John<br />\nSebastian was at one time the Loving Spoonful, but now is<br />\nJust amazing John Sebastian. Dallas Taylor used to be the<br />\ndrummer in Clear (Whatever happend to them?)

That doesn't make it old, it makes it flavorful.<br />\nThe album mixes, and it holds togetherwell.

The album is Crosby,<br />\nStills, Nash, and Young, with Taylor and Reeves providing strong support. Sebastian plays mouth harp on the<br />\ntitle cut, \"Deja vu,\" and Garcia the steel pedal guitar on<br />\nNash's light, once only-slightly country, tune, \"Teach<br />\nYour Children.\"<br />\nThe album is not the gang rape that I expected when I<br />\nfirst heard of the Crosby,Stills, Nash and Young collaboration. Though I wasn't sure who was going to get raped,<br />\nIt seemed apparent at the time that the album would be a<br />\nCS&amp;N versus Young album. Neil Young just didn't seem<br />\nto fit on Nash's island;I couldn't visualize Neil Young being<br />\na crew member on a wooden ship without setting it afire.<br />\nThe problem is solved by making 'Deja Vu' a better<br />\nCrosby, Stills, and Nash Album. The sound is deeper,<br />\ndenser, with more happening and more hidden, less freefloating but no less soaring melodies. The tight harmony<br />\nof Crosby-Stills-Nash is still very much together. When<br />\nYoung sings lead, on his own numbers (\"Helpless\" and<br />\n\"Country Girl\"), the three others build waves of smooth<br />\nharmony behind his high, hard -edged voice. When someone else does the lead vocal, Young stays out of the singing. (Young: \"I don't consider myself to be a background<br />\nsinger.\")<br />\nThe direction that they have taken from CS&amp;N's first<br />\nalbum is probably the finest choice they could have made.<br />\nIt is evident that the group is no longer riding on the<br />\nMarrakesh Express.

AD. MAJOR<br />\nSAID<br />\nSTATISTICALLY:<br /><br />\ngraduate women are to be permanently housed in McCoy Hall<br />\nand not in the Freshman and Upperclass dormitories; he is assuming that the administration<br />\nfeels that women living in the<br />\ndormitories will be in danger<br />\nfrom aggressive undergraduate<br />\nmen; and, by implication, he<br />\ndraws the conclusion that the<br />\nuniversity-owned apartment houses are the exclusive domain of<br />\nthe graduate students. He is wrong<br />\non all counts.<br />\nThe Task Force on Coeducation is, of course, considering<br />\nthe problems which Mr. Cotter<br />\nhas raised. It requested space<br />\nin McCoy Hall, on a temporary<br />\nbasis, for transfer women who<br />\nwill be coming in this fall for<br />\nthe simple reasonthat the dormitory space in the Freshman<br />\ndorms will be needed for the 500<br />\nodd male students of the Class of<br />\n1974 and because the Upperclass<br />\ndorms were not deemed suitable<br />\nfor these women without extensive alterations. Mr. Cotter fails<br />\nto remember that, at an administration-student luncheon last fall,<br />\nhe advocated the same solution<br />\nhimself. The Task Force is understandably concerned with the<br />\nhousing for women, as it is for<br />\nthe men as well, considering the<br />\nquality of the neighborhood east<br />\nand south of the university,and it<br />\nhas further requested that a housing officer be added to the administrative staff to assist all students in acquiring suitable living<br />\nquarters. The Task Force does<br />\nnot view McCoy Hall as a permanent solution to women's housing, but neither does it view the<br />\nuniversity-owned apartments as<br />\nbeing reserved exclusively for<br />\ngraduate students.It acknowledges<br />\nthat priorities need to be established, but only after all aspects<br />\nof student housing are considered.<br />\nTo the best of our knowledge<br />\nthe Freshmen class of 1970-71<br />\nwill not be increased in size. The<br />\nsize of subsequent classes remains to be determined, as does<br />\nthe proportion of women in these<br />\nclasses, but the Task Force expects that Freshman women will<br />\nbe housed in the Freshman<br />\ndormitories. Occupancy of the<br />\nUpperclass dormitories remains<br />\nan opep question because of the<br />\nneed for renovation, but under<br /><br />\nno circumstances does the administration consider that the<br />\npresence of women - Freshmen<br />\nor upperclass - in the dormitories will lead to anything other<br />\nthan a natural community of students.<br />\nI do not know what Mr. Cotter<br />\nhopes to gain by his proposed rent<br />\nstrike, but he should plan his<br />\ncampaign on a solid basis of facts<br />\nand not conjectures if he is to<br />\nmake effective use of his office as<br />\ncampaign on a solid basis of facts<br />\nand not conjectures if he is to<br />\nmake effective use of his office<br />\nas president of the Graduate<br />\nStudents Organization for constructive and meaningful change.<br />\nCarl P. Swanson<br />\nAssociate Dean for Undergraduate<br />\nStudies Task Force on Coeduation<br /><br />\nCONVISER AGREES<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nSynechdoche notwithstanding,<br />\nWilliam Benzon's argument in<br />\nthe On Vandalism column of<br />\nMarch 13 is specious.<br />\nI agree strongly with Benzon<br />\non two points: that Hopkins is no<br />\ncommunity, and that students<br />\nshould be given a role in governance. However, I fail to see the<br />\nconnection between the absence<br />\nof this condition and the presence<br />\nof bookstore theft.<br />\nMore particularly, I question<br />\nBenzon's interpretation of the<br />\nrecent theft as \"probably an act<br />\nof vandalism directed against the<br />\nUniversity.\" Benzon does say that<br />\nhe can't be sure of this, and the<br />\nfact that the hearing was closed<br />\nprohibits a direct refutation of<br />\nthis claim. However, Benzon appears to base his agrument on his<br />\ninterpretation of the theft. I wish<br />\nto counter two particulars in his<br />\nargument.<br />\nFirst, even if the accused's<br />\nintent had been to direct an act<br />\nagainst the University, the University would not have been the<br />\nultimate target of his act. His<br />\ntarget would have been the students and faculty (and others)<br />\nwho partronize the bookstore.<br />\nThe bookstore can always raise<br />\nits prices to cover the cost of<br />\ntheft; according to an article in<br />\nthe N. Y. Times Magazine of<br />\nMarch 15, shoplifting causes a<br />\n15% inflation in retail prices.<br />\nThus the victims of theft are you<br /><br />\nand me. I happen to believe that<br />\nthe way in which property is<br />\ndistributed in this country is<br />\nwrong. But I'm not in favor of<br />\nreplacing it with an irrational<br />\nand inequitable system of support of the dishonest by the honest.<br />\nSecond, the decision of the appeals board in the recent theft<br />\ncase was not a decision of the<br />\nadministration. It was made by<br />\na board consisting of only students and faculty; students voted<br />\non both sides of the issue.<br />\nI agree with Benzon that the<br />\npunishment given the accused was<br />\nharsh. The appeals board found itself faced with the alternatives of<br />\nprobation (meaningless) or suspension (harsh); it chose the latter. But students here have known<br />\nthat these are the only sanctions<br />\nused by the University in nonacademic matters; why have they<br />\nwaited until now to complain?<br />\nAnd now that they have seen the<br />\nugly consequence that the present<br />\nsystem permits, what are they<br />\ndoing to change it?<br />\nInvolvement in governance<br />\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for students to change Hopkins. The problem here is that<br />\nthe mass of student sits on its<br />\ncollective ass.

Even the<br />\nglossy magazines such as Life,<br />\nTime, etc., have consistently<br />\nachieved a higher level of reporting than this atrocious piece of<br />\ntrash.<br />\nA little research before writing such an article would show<br />\nthat the Women's Liberation<br />\nmovement is for more than<br />\nRoxanne Dunbar's \"No More Fun<br />\n&amp; Games.\" For example, WOMEN: A JOURNAL OF LIBERATION, published here in Baltimore, and available at the book-<br /><br />\nstore, although not claiming to<br />\nbe the journal of the movement,<br />\nhas a circulation almost 3 times<br />\nthat of \"No More Fun &amp;Games.\"<br />\nAs far as the relation between<br />\nWomen's Liberation and Feminism is concerned, they stand in<br />\nrelation to each other as do the<br />\nBlack Liberation movement and<br />\nthe civil rights movement. In<br />\neach case members of the former<br />\nrecognize that sexism and racism<br />\nare intricately tied into capitalism and imperialism and that<br />\nthe former can only be overcome<br />\nby a radical overthrow of the<br />\nentire system.<br />\nThe gross distortions in the<br />\narticle of the ideology of Women's Liberation are almost too<br /><br />\nnumerous to correct. Women's<br />\nsexual role is not the central target of Women's Liberation -however, Mr. Olander would do<br />\nwell to realize the extent of sexual<br />\noppression and exploitation to<br />\nwhich women have been, and are<br />\nstill subjected; and given this,<br />\nthat the women for whom sex<br />\nhas been most degrading is justified in renouncing it, just as the<br />\nblack maid is justified in refusing to endure an further the humiliation of cleaning a white<br />\nfamily's mess -- even though<br />\nsuch a refusal may cause unemployment or hardship for her.<br />\nWomen's Liberation is not a<br />\nfemale supremacist ideology,<br />\nfringe elements such as Valerie<br />\nSolanas' SCUM notwithstanding,<br />\nand sees that men too are op-<br /><br />\npressed by a system which denies<br />\nthem their emotions, and forces<br />\nthem to find their identity and<br />\nseek gratification through meaningless work experience, vicious<br />\ncompetition and quests for power,<br />\nproviding consolation, and scapegoats in the myth that they are<br />\nsuperior to women.<br />\nFree, legal, abortions and<br />\naccess to birth control are necessary for the liberation of women<br />\n--and if Mr. Olander can not<br />\nunderstand this, I suggest he<br />\nreads a play in the first issue of<br />\nAphra, a new women's literary<br />\njournal, which describes the<br />\nplight of a man who has had an<br />\ninpregnated uterus implanted in<br />\nhim.<br />\nI can only hope that the pages<br />\nof the News-Letter will not be<br /><br />\ndefaced in the future by any further irresponsible and distorted<br />\narticles such as Mr. Olander's,<br />\nand that if any more articles appear on the subject of Women's<br />\nLiberation, that the authors will<br />\nattempt to obtain some first hand<br />\ninformation on the matter --perhaps even from the very active<br />\nand strong Women's Liberation<br />\nmovement right here in Baltimore.<br />\nRobert Q.

Scotty cited<br />\nmany reasons for his outlook. First and<br />\nforemost, Coach Scott thinks that this<br />\nYale team, with a number of big boys and<br />\nplenty of speed, is the strongest in recent<br />\nyears. Another factor Scotty emphasized<br />\nwas the depth which Yale has this year at<br />\nall positions. Yale has gotten off to a very<br />\ngood start in pre -season play and already<br />\nlook like they've jelled.<br />\nIn last week's outing the Eli for almost<br />\nthree quarters led last year's club champions, the Long Island Lacrosse Club,<br />\nuntil Long Island tied it up at 4-4 with<br />\nless than a minute to go.

Scotty also mentioned middie<br />\nCarl Bates (34) and Yale team captain<br />\nJohn Rauth at attack as two fellows to<br />\nwatch tomorrow. These two returnees<br />\naccounted for 3 of the Eli's 4 goals in<br />\nlast year's onesided Hopkins win, 14-4.<br />\nScott also had much praise for middies<br />\nCurt Schmoke (32) and Jim Williams<br />\n(23).<br />\nMany of Yale's outstanding players<br />\nhail from the Baltimore area including<br />\nSchmoke, both starting defensemen Tom<br />\nSolley (31) and Bill Story (34), and goalie<br />\nStanton.<br /><br />\nCoach Scott Optimistic<br />\nWhen asked about how our players felt<br />\nabout being overshadowed in the preseason polls by a few other clubs, Coach<br />\nScott stated that, if anything, it has helped<br />\nlift the morale of the team. We're a young<br />\nteam and need experience,\" Scott said,<br />\n\"but the boys have worked veryhard and<br />\nare very anxious to prove themselves,<br />\nand really want to get out there and play.<br />\nI've been encouraged by their improvement over the past few weeks and this is<br />\na very positive sign! Scott also added that<br />\nHopkins has played the club teams and now<br />\nwants to get out and play for real.<br /><br />\nHead lacrosse coach Bob Scott talks over strategy<br />\nMoore (r.).<br />\nScott mentioned that the Hopkins team<br />\nshould be ready for tomorrow's game,<br />\nwith all starters ready to go against Yale,<br />\nexcept possibly for middle Gary Handleman, who is nursing shoulder and ankle<br />\ninjuries. He, however, did see some<br /><br />\nwith co-captains Doug Honig (1.) and Russ<br />\n'action in the Towson scrimmage earlier<br />\nin the week.<br />\nLook for a much closer opener than<br />\nlast year, as a much stronger, faster,<br />\nand more experienced Yale team tries<br />\nto revenge its 14-4 mauling at our hands<br />\na year ago.<br /><br />\nTrack Challenges Confront Masken<br /><br />\nPROBABLE STARTING LINE-UP FOR YALE GAME<br />\nPosition<br />\nGOAL<br />\nATTACK<br />\nATTACK<br />\nATTACK<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nMIDFIELD<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\nDEFENSE<br />\nDEFENSE<br /><br />\nPlayer<br />\nKEN DAUSES<br />\nSTU KAHL<br />\nDAN HALL<br />\nPAUL WALLACE<br />\nRUSS MOORE<br />\nDOUG HONIG<br />\nCHARLIE COKER<br />\nROB MACCOOL<br />\nJOE CIELSLOWSKI<br />\nPAUL WEISS<br /><br />\nYear<br />\nJUNIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nJUNIOR<br />\nSOPHOMORE<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSENIOR<br />\nSOPHOMORE<br />\nSENIOR<br /><br />\nNumber<br />\n13<br />\n23<br />\n24<br />\n15<br />\n22<br />\n11<br />\n10<br />\n32<br />\n42<br />\n34<br /><br />\nBIA Notes<br />\nIn Wednesday's consolation<br />\nThe 1970 BIA basketball season was brought to a close a match, TEP staged a second half<br />\nweek ago last Wednesday night rally to come from behind to<br />\nfor both the freshman and frat- nudge ATO 43-39.

Like<br />\na dressmaker with too little material he stretched and juggled the available resources, attempting to cover his subject. \"All events are<br />\ncovered, except for the pole vault\" he concluded.

HOELSCHER<br />\n. \"When you hear the name 'Johns Hopkins'do you<br />\n\u2014<br />\n.<br />\nthink of surgery or satellites?\" Km-luting<br />\nroster For APL<br />\nIsolated in rural Howard county, the Hopkins affiliated<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory has in the last twenty years,<br />\ndeveloped this country's most sophisticated missile and<br />\nsatellite technologies.<br />\nResearchers in the 356 acre complex, working under<br />\nan exclusive Navy contract, have done pioneer work in<br />\nguidance systems, advanced weaponry systems and satellite development.<br />\nAt present, satellite navigation systems are a major<br />\nconcern at APL. Such systems are used to guide strike<br />\nsupport ships operating in Southeast Asia.<br />\nPresently, fifty-one percent of the contracts are classified. During fiscal year 1968-69 the Laboratory published<br />\n125 classified reports from a total of 275project reports.<br />\nAlthough the emphasis on military research has not<br />\nabated, the Director of APL, Dr. Alexander Kossiakoff,<br />\nhas recently stated that the Laboratory is presently<br />\nseeking funds for non-military research. He cited cooperative programs with the Johns Hopkins School of<br />\nMedicine and the National Institutes of Health as indications of such a move. The major block to further such<br />\nprograms, claims Kossiakoff, is a lack of sufficient funding.<br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory is,today, a \"problemsolving\" research complex. Established in 1942 at the<br />\nrequest of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the Laboratory was asked specifically to develop<br />\n\"an influence-type anti-aircraft shell.\"<br />\nIn response researchers at the Laboratory equipped<br />\nartillery shells with a triggering device based on a proximity fuse rather than the more conventional time-fuse.<br />\nThis development increased the accuracy and the firing<br />\nspeed of Navy cannons. Such shells were used effectively against the \"buzz\" bombs of the Germans and the<br />\nJapanese kamikaze planes--both of which had previously<br />\nbeen impervious to the Allied gunnery.<br />\nThis \"problem-solving\" approach has been maintained<br />\nat the Laboratory. Dr. Richard Ellis, supervisor of the<br />\nSpace Engineering Branch of APL stated that \"APL<br />\nwill not take cut and dry development projects. We<br />\nInsist on looking at the whole problem, and evaluating<br />\nthe project.\"<br />\nEllis stated that APL retains the perogative of rejecting all proposals put forth by the Navy, the Laboratory's<br />\nsole contractor. \"We might reject a job on humane or<br />\ntechnical reasons. Maybe they're trying to solve the<br />\nwrong problem.\"<br /><br />\n\"Just Ten Per Cent\"<br />\n\"The essential difference,\" he continued, \"between<br />\nAPL and other research organizations is our whole attitude. We ask,\"Is the thing we're deing relevant to the<br />\nproblem?' Relevancy of our work is the first criterion.\"<br />\nPresently, the research conducted at the Applied Physics Laboratory which is directly related to military developments consists of satellite research and the Fleet<br />\nAir Defense Program. Dr. Kossiakoff noted that the<br />\nFleet Air Defense work consists primarily of \"information work in on-board equipment.\" He explained that<br />\nradar and satellite tracking techniques are a major<br />\nconcern for the Navy.<br />\nDespite APL's past commitment to missile research,<br />\nKossiakoff claimed that the Laboratory presently devotes<br />\nonly ten per cent of its resources to such developments.<br />\nThe Director was, however, reluctant to discuss in any<br />\ndetail the type of unclassified military research presently being conducted at the Laboratory.<br /><br />\nRIM-2 Advanced Terrier supersonic ship-to-air missile designed by the APL to replace the Terrier and Tartar missile series seen in dual<br />\nlauncher on shipboard.<br />\nment.<br />\nHe would only Say that the Laboratory was engaged in<br />\nKossiakoff did state that the Laboratory will \"press in<br />\ndeveloping submarine detection methods.<br />\nthe direction of getting into the non-military area as<br />\nThe Director was considerably more willing to discuss<br />\nfast as we can get support.\" Such work presently comthe \"socially beneficial\" research being conducted at<br />\nprises only six per cent of the total research conducted<br />\nAPL. There are two major sources of such research:<br />\nat<br />\nthe Laboratory. He said, however, that there is novi<br />\nthe \"Task X Fund\" and developments resulting from<br />\nthree times the number of presently active non-military<br />\nthe technical spin-off of military research done for the<br />\nprojects approved still waiting for funding. \"I don't<br />\nNavy.<br />\nknow how the hell we're going to get to twenty per cent,\"<br />\nThe Task X Fund is the pool of money resulting from<br />\nhe added.<br />\nan overhead allowance charged the Navy for military<br />\nresearch. This independent fund is alloted to APL<br />\nresearchers for whatever basic research they wish to<br />\nconduct.<br /><br />\nGovernment Dictated Limits<br />\n\"To all practical purposes,\" noted Dr. Ellis, \"the<br />\nNavy is subsidizing this work (on non-military research.)\"<br />\nSpin-off from military research is an additional source<br />\nof material for socially useful projects Dr. Ellis pointed<br />\nout that the APL-developed pacemaker is powered by an<br />\nenergy source made for satellite guidance systems. The<br />\npacemaker is radically different from the proceeding<br />\ngeneration of artificial heart stimulators, as it can be<br />\nautomatically recharged thus alleviating the need for<br />\nperiodic surgical replacement which has plagued and<br />\nthreatened heart patients in the past. This new power<br />\nsource has also been incorporated into designs for prosthetic or artificial limbs.<br />\nIn line with a recent government decision, the Directors at APL have decided to temporarily accept a twenty<br />\nper cent limit on the amount of \"socially beneficial\"<br />\nresearch conducted at the Laboratory. \"We're going to<br />\nmove with the national priorities,\" stated Kossiakoff.<br />\n\"We'll use our talents to the best that is possible.\" The<br />\npriorities mentioned by Kossiakoff are set by the govern-<br /><br />\nPossible Cabinet Support<br /><br />\nKossiakoff noted that the government is presently<br />\ntrying to publicize the benefits of research centers like<br />\nthe Applied Physics Laboratory to cabinet members.<br />\nSecretary of State Melvin Laird has recently written<br />\nto all cabinet members advising - them that APL and<br />\nsimilar research centers may provide answers to some<br />\nof their most difficult problems. Among those who have<br />\nalready responded are The Department of the Interior,<br />\nThe Department of Transportation and HEW.<br />\n\"We'll push on to twenty per cent,\" stated Kossiakoff,<br />\nand if we reach it we'll fall back, regroup and consider<br />\nwhat to do.\"<br />\nIt is certain that if the Laboratory is ever faced with<br />\nthe possibility of exceeding the government's twenty per<br />\ncent limit on non-military research at APL, such decisions will be made with The Department of Defense.<br />\nBoth Kossiakoff and Ellis noted that all equipment at<br />\nthe Laboratory belongs to the Navy.<br />\nThe Laboratory is free to use that equipment in any<br />\nway it desires so long as the contract with the Department of the Navy is not terminated. The director agreed<br />\nthat to force the issue with the Navy would jeopardize<br />\nthe existing projects.<br />\nKossiakoff added that \"we feel we should move in<br />\nthese directions (towards non-military research) not because military research is useless or somehow bad but<br />\njust that other problems are becoming important. As<br />\nmore important things arise we'll sluff off the less important things.\"<br /><br />\nSocially Beneficial Research<br /><br />\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory in Howard County was established in 1942 to develop \"an influence type anti aircraft shell.\"<br /><br />\nThe initial search for non-military projects has been<br />\nin a variety of directions. APL now has cooperative<br />\nprograms with the Hopkins School of Medicine and the<br />\nHopkins' Center for Urban Affairs, as well as a research<br />\nevaluation project with the Department of Transportation.<br />\nWorking with the Center for Urban Affairs, the Laboratory has initiated a program designed to apply spaceage technology and physical sciences to the problems<br />\nassociated with large urban centers. Working in conjunction with Hopkins' faculty members, APL researchers are presently sorting programs having national significance.<br />\nAmong those areas designated for study are waste<br />\ncontrol, industrial housing, utilization of sewage wastes<br />\nas well as possible means of modeling urban systems<br />\nand control of thermal pollution.<br />\nAPL is also involved in evaluating the technological<br />\nfeasibility of various transportation plans for the Urban<br />\nMass Transportation Administration. The Laboratory is<br />\n(Continued on page 15)<br /><br />\nMarch 20, 1970<br /><br />\nPAGE 15<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nWeapons Outdistance Social Projects,<br />\nBut APL 'Working to Achieve Peace'<br />\n(Continued from page 14)<br />\naiding in the development of the sophisticated command<br />\nand control systems which are necessary to guide vehicles and processes the vaste amount of data in a reasonable period of time.<br />\nA third and very significant area of non-military research engaged in by researchers at APL is with the<br />\nHopkins' Medical School. Over four and a half years,<br />\nthe Laboratory and Medical School have cooperated<br />\nin such fields as nuclear medicine ophthalmology, biomedical engineering, radiography, cardio-vascular systems and the delivery of health systems.<br />\nThis has led APL to develop techniques in areas of<br />\ninstrumentation, theoretical modeling, systems engineering and simulation and technique development.<br />\nThree-Dimensional X-Rays<br />\nOne result of this cooperation is a three-dimensional<br />\nX-ray system allowing for a fast and thorough study of<br />\nPatients. The system includes a series of twenty, conventional X-ray pictures which when projected into an<br />\nempty spance form a three-dimensional image of the<br />\noriginal subject. By passing a viewing screen through<br />\nthe image, cross sections of the image may be examined.<br />\nBY rotating and translating the screen any desired<br />\nPlane within the image may be examined.<br />\nThis system, stated Dr. David G. Grant, developer<br />\nof the apparatus, allows the doctor to view internal<br />\nstructures from any angle, even those which might<br />\nnormally by obscured in conventional X-rays.<br /><br />\nDr. Kossiakoff noted that such developments are<br />\nnecessarily limited due to the shortage of funds. He<br />\nsaid that APL was able to engage in such work only because of its very free relationship with the Navy. \"Other<br />\nagencies just don't have the equipment we've got,\" he<br />\nadded.<br />\nThere are additional reasons why more money cannot<br />\nbe poured into socially useful projects. Kossiakoff<br />\nstated that it is APL's task to develop increasingly<br />\ncomplex weaponry systems. \"Since World War II the<br />\nmilitary technology has gotten to such a point that any<br />\nnafion that wants to, can make weapons so dreadful<br />\nthat unless you maintain yourself on a reasonably equal<br />\nfooting, you'll be at the mercy of other nations.\"<br />\nWhile recognizing the potential over-kill capability of<br />\ntoday's superpowers, the Director argued that such conditions lead only a temporary stalemate\" and you can't<br />\npredict how long it will continue.\"<br />\n\"We're actively working to achieve peace,\" he observed, \"and how you do that depends on your history.<br />\nMost of us have lived through the last war and we're<br />\nacutely aware of what the Chinese and Russians have<br />\ndone.\" Kossiakoff added that he has seen no change in<br /><br />\nTabs nuclear-warhead missiles on shipboard launcher. The Tabs<br />\nprogram resulted from the Bumblebee research program initiated<br />\nby APL.<br /><br />\nman's relations since the 1940s.<br />\nWhen asked why the Applied Physics Laboratory's<br />\nrecruiting emphasized solely military research, however, Kossiakoff replied \"we don't want to give people<br />\ncoming here the idea that they can immediately work on<br />\nsocially significant research. We don't want to create<br />\nthe illusion that APL is one hundred per cent for socially<br /><br />\nAPL has its own Principal Staff, acting as the Deans of<br />\nthe other Divisons, who are answerable solely to the<br />\nTrustees. The Principal Staff and the Trustees are the<br />\nmajor policy making body for the Applied Physics Laboratory.<br />\nDr. Kossiakoff stated that the benefits of this system<br />\nare \"primarily intangible\". Noting that the University<br />\nis legally responsible for the Laboratory, Kossiakoff<br />\nsaid that the relationship acts as an umbrella and means<br />\nof protecting the research complex from governmental<br />\ninfluences.<br />\nSim ilarily, the Laboratory gains through close association with the University divisions such as the School of<br />\nMedicine. Such a relationship allows each section to tap<br />\nthe resources of the other. \"We've developed a very potent team,\" said Kossiakoff.<br />\nIn a private interview with the News-Letter last week,<br />\nDr. Gordon stated that \"If (APL) did not exist today and<br />\nsomeone came to us and asked that it be established, I<br />\nthink it unlikely that the approach would be accepted.\"<br />\nHe added, however, that the reason for keeping the primarily classified research complex on campus is for<br />\nthe University to benefit from the interrelationships.<br />\nAPL staff, while holding appointments at Hopkins do<br />\nnot have tenure.<br />\nThe relation with the University has left the Applied<br />\nPhysics Laboratory in a unique position. Kossiakoff<br />\nstated that the Laboratory is neither a University research center nor equivalent to private industry.<br />\n\"In any job we've been asked to do, if we think it can<br />\nbe done equally well by private organizations or by private industry, we will not except it. We do not compete<br />\nwith private industry.\"<br />\n\"When we take a job,\" he continued, \"we are the best<br />\nqualified to do it.\"<br /><br />\nuseful work.\"<br />\nSince 1942 APL has operated under a single Government contract, administered by the Navy. This contract,<br />\nan administration convenience, funnels all funds into the<br />\nLaboratory. As outside groups, such as the National<br />\nInstitutes of Health, have specific problems to propose<br />\nto the Laboratory, they approach the Navy who, in turn,<br />\ndirects them to APL. In this way all work done at APLs<br />\nNavy contracted and under Navy control.<br />\nActing as mediators between the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory and the Navy, there are a series of research<br />\nsponsors. These sponsors are primarily concerned<br />\nwith negotiating arrangements for contract work or for<br />\nfinding outside interests for developments made as part<br />\nof the technical spin off from military research.<br />\nFrom its conception the research complex has operated on a no-gain-no-loss basis. Because of this policy,<br />\nincome collected from the small fee charged on all contract work is placed in the APL Stabilization and Contingency Fund.<br />\nThis fund provides protection against major cost disallowances provides for the payment of the principle<br />\nexecutives of the Laboratory,for non-reimbursable costs<br />\nand provides a reserve in the event of termination of the<br />\nLaboratory's operations.<br />\nNone of the University's general or endownment funds<br />\nhave been used to support the Laboratory.<br />\nAdministratively, the Laboratory is completely independent from the University. Like all Hopkins' divisions,<br /><br />\nDr. Alexander Kossiakoff, Director of the APL: \"We will press<br />\nin the direction of getting into the non-military area as fast as<br />\nwe can get support.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br />\n3330 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n467-2123<br />\nTailoring, Repairing, Dying<br /><br />\nST.

Technology is for human<br />\nuse, and every<br />\nenterprise has to have its needs, goals and aspirations<br />\nconstantly reviewed.\"<br /><br />\nDr. George Wald, a Nobel Prize winner and peace<br />\nmovement leader, will speak on April 9 at the School of<br />\nAdvanced International Studies (SAIS)in Washington,D.C.<br />\nDr. Wald, the Higgins Professor of Biology at Harvard,<br />\nwill speak on \"Man and Machine: Prospect for Human<br />\nEnterprise\" at 8 p.m. Wald packed Shriver Hall last Octdber as the keynote speaker in the Milton S. Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium on the Military.<br />\nHis speech is part of a series on \"Computers, Communications and the Public Interest\" sponsored by Hopkins and the Brookings Institute. Anyone interested in<br />\ntaking a free bus down to the speech should contact Dr.<br />\nGreenberger at Ext. 895.<br />\nDr. Wald first came into national prominence after a<br />\nMarch 4, 1969 speech at MIT during a research stoppage<br />\nprotest. The speech was an eloquent, moving plea against<br />\nmilitarism and war. Its impact was so overwhelming<br />\nthat today it is still known as simply \"The Speech.\" It<br />\nwas reprinted in full in the New Yorker and other magazines and Dr. Wald's name became a household world.<br /><br />\nHampton House: Disapointment, Disgust, Apathy<br />\nThe following article was written by Nannette Woolcock<br />\nfrom the Hopkins Nursing School (Hampton House).<br />\nAlthough the story was edited, its content remains<br />\nunchanged.<br />\nDisappointment, disgust, misunderstanding,low morale<br />\nand apathy seem to describe the atmosphere surrounding<br />\nthe students of the Hopkins School of Nursing. With emotions at a peak, most students have decided that some sort<br />\nof action must be taken with regard to their lack of communication with the administration.<br />\nThe crisis has culminated in the refusal of the executivefaculty committee to grant the students' request for a fourday weekend at Easter. In January the students petitioned<br />\nfor an extra day and supported this demand by what they<br />\nconsidered reasonable arguments.<br />\nAt the time other requests were made concerning graduation and the dress code. Only the dress code changes requested by the students were accepted. No official notification was given to the student body concerning the request<br />\n.for an extended holiday.<br />\nAccording to one instructor, the freshman class has<br />\n\"reacted in an abnormal way to stress.\" The class of '72<br />\nhas already received more social regulation changes and<br />\nhas apparently demanded more personalized attention than<br />\nhave previous classes.<br />\nFacts indicating student inability to cope with<br />\nthe<br />\nanxiety-producing situations peculiar to a nursing<br />\neducation are: approximately 70 percent of the class<br />\nof '69<br />\nsought Psychiatric Counceling, according to one<br />\ninstructor; the class of '70, once 83 in number, is now<br />\nhoping to<br />\ngraduate 49;the junior class,once 81 strong,has diminished to 50.<br /><br />\nTo many students the controversy over the four-day<br />\nweekend symbolizes the underlying discontent of the student body, and its feeling that communication with the<br />\nadministration is lacking. This idea is embodied in a second petition, to be submitted for consideration.Some students, particularly juniors, feel the need to go directly<br />\nto Mrs. Price, the Director of Nursing,and express their<br />\ndisappointment and hopes that satisfactory action can be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nThe reasons behind the students' continued appeal are:<br />\nthey are tired; the extra day is of no academic signifigance<br />\nsince grades will be handed in by March 24; four days<br />\nwould make traveling much less strenuous; it is a religious<br />\nholiday for a majority of the students; and it is the end of a<br />\nsemester. Some administratorsfind these reasons unconvincing. As one has remarked, \"You knew nursing was<br />\ngoing to be tough when you came. If you can't take it,<br />\nleave.\"<br />\nThe students have voiced reactions against such attitudes. One student, Michele Cawley, stated, \"We should be<br />\ntreated as individuals and can no longer tolerate being<br />\nvictims of an impenetrable system.\" A senior student<br />\nmentioned the fact that \"We're tired of swallowing everything, and we're ready to vomit.\"<br />\nAt one point there had been discussion by a number of<br />\nangry students over the possibility of not showing up for<br />\nwork on March 26, after proper notification of the clinical<br />\nareas involved. Other students were finally roused to<br />\nmeet and discuss other less dramatic but equally effective<br />\nways to express their dissatisfaction. Plans for immediate establishment of better and more mature lines of<br />\ncommunication are underway.<br /><br />\nFORUM<br />\nON<br />\nUNIVERSITY GOVERNANCE<br /><br />\nThe speech gave him a fame that his Nobel Prize in<br />\nMedicine and Psychology has never gained for him. The<br />\nNew York TimesMagazineSectiondidalengthyfeature story<br />\non Dr. Wald, who has since become an important figure<br />\nin the peace movement.<br />\nIn an interview with the News-Letter, Dr. Wald discussed technology, the environment, and politics.<br />\nDr. Wald speaks in the same thoughtful style that marks<br />\nhis speeches. Referring to his upcomimg speech on<br />\ncomputers, Wald commented, \"The computers are hurting culture.\" He continued, \"Creativity is suffering, and<br />\nthe life of the scientist is being degraded. Some may<br />\nspeak of computers writing poetry or making music, but<br />\nart is going down-hill.\"<br />\nWald is worried about the directions technology appears to be taking. \"We need,\" he stated, \"a complete<br />\nchange in the way technology develops. Technology is for<br />\nhuman use, and every enterprise has to have its needs,<br />\ngoals and aspirations constantly reviewed.\"<br />\nDr. Wald would like to see a wholesale revision in Our<br />\nattitudes toward technology and production. \"We all too<br />\ncommonly take for granted what we can do, rather than<br />\nwhat we should do.\" He is not, however, as wary about<br />\nscience as he is about technology. He stressed, \"Science<br />\nis about knowing and understanding, and it is inherentlY<br />\ngood. Technology, though, can be good or bad, depending<br />\non what we do with it.\"<br />\nWald charged that \"too many of these important technological decisions are made only by the producers. we<br />\nin<br />\nneed<br />\ncareful and constant intrusion of the public<br />\n\"It will pollute the air, it will give us a disastrous<br />\nsonic boom. And to what end? So some jet-setters can<br />\nget across the Atlantic a few hours faster.\"<br />\nWald views the environmental crisis with a curious<br />\nmlexture of despair and hopd; \"This is the crisis of<br />\ncrises,\" he said. \"We are now,\" he continued, \"at the<br />\ncrossroads: We have either the chance to survive or the<br />\nthreat of perishing. This is both a threat and an opportunity.\" He noted, \"Unfortunately, only when something<br />\nhas become critical are large numbers of people shaken<br />\nout of their apathy.\"<br />\nHe welcomes all the recent concern about the environment, but he warns that we must avoid some major pitfalls. \"We can't let the environment distract us from<br />\nother major problems like the war and poverty, and we<br />\nhave to be prepared to deal with the major interests who<br />\nwill be affected by a real attack on environmental problems.\" He added, \"We must go to the source, and so<br />\nwe are going to be stepping on some pretty important<br />\ntoes.\"<br />\nWald places a lot of faith in youth. \"Winter has been<br />\ncold to demonstrations, but when spring comes, the kids<br />\nwill be out in the streets again. And that's the way policy<br />\nshould be made--it's better than having it made in the<br />\noffices of Lockheed and General Motors.\"<br /><br />\nThe Old Homestead.<br /><br />\nAre you satisfied, dissatisfied or apathetic with YOUR university's governance?
