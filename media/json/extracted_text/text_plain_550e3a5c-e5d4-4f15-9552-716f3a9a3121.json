Last year's football team<br />\nhad done well, but it was certainly<br />\nnot a wonder; and with loss of<br />\nsuch g000d men as Capt. Stockett,<br />\n\"Chance\" Bosley,\" \"Ham\" Owens,<br />\n\"Doc\" :,Streett, f'Doc\" Bryan, and<br />\nAlan Chesney, things certainly looked dubious.<br />\nThe Senior Class is<br />\nsmall and hardly remarkable for<br />\nathletic powers.<br />\nThe sophomores<br />\nwere largely \"black listed.\"<br />\nThe<br />\nfreshmen are an unknown quantity<br />\nand the juniors had lost several good<br />\nmen.<br />\nThe lacrosse prospects were but<br />\nlittle better, for only five of last<br />\nyear's team weire back and \"Big Bill\"<br />\nSchmeisser had announced his inability to coach this season. Moreover, Captain Clary, the logical<br />\nleader of the team, had been forced<br />\nto resign because of his other University work.<br />\nTrack was indeed the brightest spot<br />\nin the athletic future and that was<br />\nnone too rosy.<br />\nBlack<br />\n\"Hooley\"<br />\nWill be missed in the high jumps,<br />\n\"Billy\" Bond and \"Jim\" Baily cannot win points in the dashes, \"Babe\"<br />\nMichael will not be able to put the<br />\nshot, Russell has graduated, and<br />\n\"Dutch\" Breyer barred by the four<br />\nyear rule. The loss of these old men<br />\nhowever, only shows how slim were<br />\nour best chances in athletics.<br />\nBut what has happened?<br />\nThe football team after a pitiful<br />\nOpening game that would freeze the<br />\nheart out of the most optimistic<br />\nblack and blue rooter developed into as perfect a football machine as<br />\never played for Hopkins. Their record speaks for itself:<br />\nMd. Agg-ies, 9-0.<br />\nStevens, 6\u2014o.<br />\nRandolph-Macon, 8\u2014o.<br />\nWest.

We know that they are<br />\ngoing to do as well as the best of<br />\ntheir successful predecessors.

Hopkins athletics instead of<br />\n\"going, going, gone\" are climbing<br />\nup and even higher.<br />\nThe season is twofold\u2014a closer<br />\nbond of interest between the undergraduates and the alumni resulting<br />\nin greater spirit and substantial financial backing from the \"old boys,\"<br />\nand increased spirit and a \"Heaven<br />\nhelps those who help themselves\"<br />\nidea among those of us still in the<br />\nUniversity.

Last year's football team<br />\nhad done well, but it was certainly<br />\nnot a wonder; and with loss of<br />\nsuch g000d men as Capt. Stockett,<br />\n\"Chance\" Bosley,\" \"Ham\" Owens,<br />\n\"Doc\" :,Streett, f'Doc\" Bryan, and<br />\nAlan Chesney, things certainly looked dubious.<br />\nThe Senior Class is<br />\nsmall and hardly remarkable for<br />\nathletic powers.<br />\nThe sophomores<br />\nwere largely \"black listed.\"<br />\nThe<br />\nfreshmen are an unknown quantity<br />\nand the juniors had lost several good<br />\nmen.<br />\nThe lacrosse prospects were but<br />\nlittle better, for only five of last<br />\nyear's team weire back and \"Big Bill\"<br />\nSchmeisser had announced his inability to coach this season. Moreover, Captain Clary, the logical<br />\nleader of the team, had been forced<br />\nto resign because of his other University work.<br />\nTrack was indeed the brightest spot<br />\nin the athletic future and that was<br />\nnone too rosy.<br />\nBlack<br />\n\"Hooley\"<br />\nWill be missed in the high jumps,<br />\n\"Billy\" Bond and \"Jim\" Baily cannot win points in the dashes, \"Babe\"<br />\nMichael will not be able to put the<br />\nshot, Russell has graduated, and<br />\n\"Dutch\" Breyer barred by the four<br />\nyear rule. The loss of these old men<br />\nhowever, only shows how slim were<br />\nour best chances in athletics.<br />\nBut what has happened?<br />\nThe football team after a pitiful<br />\nOpening game that would freeze the<br />\nheart out of the most optimistic<br />\nblack and blue rooter developed into as perfect a football machine as<br />\never played for Hopkins. Their record speaks for itself:<br />\nMd. Agg-ies, 9-0.<br />\nStevens, 6\u2014o.<br />\nRandolph-Macon, 8\u2014o.<br />\nWest.

We know that they are<br />\ngoing to do as well as the best of<br />\ntheir successful predecessors. There<br />\nare bigger and more promising<br />\nsquads under the tutelage of<br />\nCoaches Chesney and Hoffman than<br />\never before turned out to try for<br />\nBoth these coaches<br />\nthese teams.<br />\nare masters of their respective arts.<br />\nAttractive schedules have been arranged by the respective managements.<br />\nToday we are, after a most dismal<br />\noutlook, on the threshold of a greater and a more successful athletic future.
