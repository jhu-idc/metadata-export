Uninspiring lectures that repeat<br />\nwhat is covered in boring textbooks,<br />\nbusywork that is called homework or lab,<br />\nbooks to be read so quickly that they<br />\nmust be skimmed, tests and quizzes that<br />\ndisrupt both sleep and learning, and,<br />\nworst of all, apathy about academic work<br />\nin general. To a naive observer, Hopkins<br />\nwould appear to be in desperate need of<br />\neducational reform. Yet when attempts<br />\nare made by the administration to find<br />\nout what the students want, they<br />\ninvariably discover that a majority of<br />\nthem are satisfied with what Hopkins has<br />\nto offer, while the remainder want minor<br />\nchanges, such as the size of classes,<br />\nnumber of seminars offered, or the type<br />\nof grading system used.<br />\nI would like to suggest that a possible<br />\nreason for .this disparity is that when<br />\nasked What is wrong with Hopkins, most<br />\nstudents limit their thinking to everyday<br />\nmatters, such as the ininber of tests<br />\ngiven. As a result of _this. they enncludp<br />\n<br />\nlist all of the resources that they can<br />\nprovide for the students. It would then be<br />\nup to each student to decide what to do<br />\nwith the opportunities.<br />\nThus students will find that they must \u2022<br />\nask themselves \"what is personally worth<br />\nlearning?'(Some may find that they do<br />\nnot want to learn anything; hopefully,<br />\nthey would have the sense to drop out<br />\ninstead of resort to being taught.)<br />\nPersonally committing oneself to learning<br />\nsomething, be it calculus, film-making or<br />\nwhatever, means that the classic problem<br />\nof motivating the student is solved,<br />\neliminating the need for the rewards,<br />\npunishments, and threats currently used<br />\nto force students to \"learn\".<br />\nAfter deciding what he will learn, the<br />\nstudent must determine how he will<br />\nlearn. Some students may feel that they<br />\ncan best learn by means of a lecture. It<br />\nwould then become their responsibility to<br />\ncontact professors and try to organize a<br />\nlecture. Hopefully, most students would<br />\n<br />\nthat there is nothing radically wrong with<br />\nHopkins, nothing that caCt be fixed by<br />\n<br />\ninefficient and<br />\n<br />\nsome minor alterations such as offering<br />\nfresh men seminars.<br />\nTo some students, however, there is<br />\nsomething terribly wrong with Hopkins,<br />\nsomething transcending the everday<br />\nroutine. What is fundamentally wrong is<br />\nthe failure of students, faculty, and<br />\nadministrators to realize that the<br />\nindividual should be personally<br />\nresponsible for his own education. This<br />\nmatter is related to a larger issue affecting<br />\nthe whole of our culture.<br />\n\u2022 Many critiques of modern society have<br />\nnoted that we live in a technocracy where<br />\n\"experts\" have the final say in most<br />\nmatters concerning our lives. For<br />\nexample, \"experts\" decide where new<br />\nhospitals and roads are to be built, often<br />\nwithout consulting the persons who are<br />\nto be displaced by them. Such rule by<br />\nexperts is accepted by many people. On<br />\nthe other hand, few persons would allow<br />\na nutritionist to dictate what they should<br />\neat, or a doctor to tell them when to go<br />\nto sleep or how to conduct their sex life.<br />\nThis is because we believe in individual<br />\ncontrol regarding how we use our bodies,<br />\nwhat we may say, feel, or think. But<br />\nstrangely enough, millions of college<br />\nstudents accept a violation of their basic<br />\nrights in submitting to the compulsory<br />\nlearning that goes on in school.<br />\nWe are told and accept that<br />\neducational experts. such as our<br />\nprofessors, know what is best for us to<br />\nlearn and how we should learn what they<br />\nhave selected for us. Yet research<br />\nconducted by some of these same<br />\nprofessors shows that we usually learn<br />\nbest when we learn on our own; that is,<br />\nwhen we are internally motivated.<br />\nOf course, we are given some choice we can choose between prepackaged<br />\neducational units that we may consumer.<br />\nBut just as choosing between CBS. NBC.<br />\nand ABC is really no choice at all, so it is<br />\nwith the various courses offered to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIf one accepts this basic premise,<br />\nnamely, that just as the college student is<br />\nmature enough to decide how long his<br />\nhair will be, to decide what clothes he<br />\nwill wear, so should he be given the<br />\n'responsibility to learn what he wants to<br />\nand how he wants to; then a radically<br />\n,new view of education appears.<br />\nFor example, it no longer appears<br />\ninsance to suggest, as Postman and<br />\n'Weingarten do, that students run a<br />\n'University. Nor does it seem farfetched to<br />\n'suggest that we can desChool society, as<br />\n'advocated by Ivan Illich, without causing<br />\ndisastrous results.<br />\nIn practice what does assuming<br />\npersonal control over one's education<br />\nmean? It would mean that students<br />\nwould be required to take a more active<br />\n'role in their college career. Instead of<br />\n:professors offering courses, they might<br />\n<br />\nn<br />\n<br />\n_ ict.st<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\n_tre.<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins entered by the Freshman this week is<br />\nfar different from the Hopkins of even a year ago.<br />\nEntering students were greeted with an enthusiasm<br />\nuncommon here. This more cordial greeting marks the<br />\nbeginning of a new perception of the non-academic<br />\nneeds of students here. The appointment of Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick as Dean of Students is indicative of a new<br />\nconcern for student welfare on the part of the<br />\nadministration. And the success of the Orientation<br />\nprogram shows that careful and concerted action by<br />\nstudents can do much to improve their lot. If this<br />\natmosphere of cooperation and committment<br />\ncontinues throughout the year, then Hopkins will no<br />\nlonger by cynically labeled as a haven for Ivy League<br />\nrejects and cut-throat competitive pre-meds.<br />\nThe improved atmosphere on campus shows that<br />\nstudents, faculty and administration all have more to<br />\ngain by working with each other than by jealousy<br />\nguarding their own prerogatives. Until recently,<br />\nHopkins was a declining as a university. The apparent<br />\nreversal of this trend may make a Hopkins that<br />\nstudents \u2018vill not regret having chosen.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 ii<br />\n<br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nAt first it's all very clear. No one is<br />\nexempt from the new set of pressures;<br />\nand, as newcomers, people must try to<br />\nre-establish personalities. In that sense<br />\nthere is equality.<br />\nEvery year Housemasters have stories<br />\nof people being very genuinely surprised<br />\nthat no one else knows or cares whether<br />\nor not they were the Homecoming Queen<br />\nor in the Honor Society. The first few<br />\nweeks at Hopkins make home look really<br />\ngood. When you were there you could<br />\nknow who you were.<br />\nOhhh yeah--Even though you weren't<br />\nactually unhappy at Hopkins, it was<br />\nfantastic to get back home. Good 'ol<br />\nfriends in Cleveland or Roanoke or<br />\nanywhere are still good 'ol friends at<br />\nThanksgiving and Christmas. And Jenny<br />\nnever looked so attractive. Or John was<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nH<br />\n<br />\ninstruction. It would seem probable that<br />\nsome students would organize their own<br />\nseminars, or what Illicit calls<br />\n\"peer-matching\". Others would probably<br />\nbe content to learn from books or field<br />\nexperiences and by-pass the faculty<br />\ncompletely.their interest cannot be<br />\npredicted or guaranteed. Thus, the nation<br />\nthat topics are covered in a term's worth<br />\nof work would be discredited. Students<br />\nwould also realize that because of the<br />\nrelatedness of knowledge, studying one<br />\ntopic often leads to interest in another<br />\none, and therefore would not confine<br />\nthemselves to a rigid curriculum.<br />\nIn sum, the implications of a student .<br />\nrun university are as far ranging as they<br />\nare important.<br />\nOpinion is everybody's voice in the<br />\nNews-Letter.

A lot of these really good friends<br />\nmysteripusly get duller or replaced long<br />\nbefore it's possible to leave Baltimore<br />\nwith a diploma. Jenny has become Suzy<br />\nor John becomes Perry at some point,<br />\nand the circle formed by hometown<br />\nfriends becomes much smaller.<br />\nOne of the many things that causes this<br />\nis that people become comfortable at<br />\nHopkins. Homewood becomes much<br />\nmore friendly than it seemed to be during<br />\nthe first few days. Your emotional center<br />\nof gravity shifts accordingly.

You:re in Roanoke and<br />\ntalking about what has happened in<br />\nBaltimore, although you used to talk only<br />\nabout Roanoke in both places. You've<br />\ncome back home to Roanoke (birthplace,<br />\n<br />\npatents, familiarity), or are you going<br />\nback home to Hopkins (Baltimore, peers,<br />\nfamiliarity, vocation?)<br />\nBy now there is very little which<br />\nfrightens you; you know the strength of<br />\nall the different pressures. Do you<br />\nremember when it was all very clear?<br />\nA remaining problem is that of leaving<br />\nwhich is closely tied up with the other<br />\nproblem, vocation. For virtually<br />\neveryone, honest-to-goodness job<br />\npreparation and employment involves<br />\nleaving Homewood. And whether or not<br />\nsome type of graduate work is in the<br />\ncards, there's the problem of<br />\nremembering even if it's only a matter of<br />\nremembering classes. You should be able<br />\nto remember events at Hopkins long after<br />\nyou physically leave it, but if you have<br />\nbeen comfortable and at ease (\"By now<br />\nthere is very little at Hopkins which<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nin vna_oo<br />\n<br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\nMost of us have enough trouble trying<br />\nto sort out the small part of the physical<br />\nworld with which we have direct contact.<br />\nTwo physics department professors,<br />\nRichard Henry and William Fasties, have<br />\nrecently taken on considerably<br />\nmore--about a thousand galaxies, as a .<br />\nmatter of fact.<br />\nThe galaxies were not chosen<br />\nrandomly. They are all in what is called<br />\nthe Cosma Cluster, which is located in the<br />\nconstellation Coma Berenices. The cluster<br />\nis calculated to be only (\"only\" for<br />\nastronomers) two billion years old, while<br />\nthe universe is generally believed to be<br />\ngoing on 10 billion years.<br />\nTextbooks say that Coma Berenices is<br />\nnorth of Virgo and .between Bootes and<br />\nLeo, but a layman writer said, \"It's<br />\nindescribably huge and unthinkably<br />\ndistant.\" Both descriptions mean that<br />\nwe're dependent on the good professors<br />\n<br />\nfor any possible explanations.<br />\nSome of tbe galaxies in the cluster are<br />\nmoving at the speed of 1,000 kilometers a<br />\nsecond, which is 2.2 million miles an<br />\nhour. Now, this speed means there's a lot<br />\nof centrifugal force. And according to the<br />\nlaws of physics, gravitational force (which<br />\nis determined by the mass in the system,'<br />\nwill balance the centrifugal force in a<br />\nstable system. Astronomers have not been<br />\nable to detect more than one-seventh of<br />\nthe mass which would be needed to<br />\nprevent the gast moving galaxies in the<br />\nCosma Cluster from tearing themselves<br />\napart. Which means the cluster is<br />\ndisintegrating.<br />\nThis is where the Hopkins people<br />\nenter. Dr. Fastie, who is an atmospherics<br />\nexpert, has designed a very special camera<br />\nwhich will be on board Apollo 17 in<br />\nDecember. The unit will be able to detect<br />\nhigh-energy ultraviolet light,. and that<br />\nlight is the most important ingredient in<br />\n<br />\nthe astronomers' explanation for the<br />\nmissing mass.<br />\nThe explanation of explanation is<br />\n<br />\nGo to come to Hopkins this weekend<br />\nBy RICHARD WARING<br />\nIt is the oldest game in the world,<br />\ndating from 2000 B. C. when it was<br />\nplayed by Chinese Royalty, long before<br />\nchess or checkers was invented. It is<br />\ncalled Go and it takes five minutes to<br />\nlearn and years to master.<br />\nNow predominately a Japanese game,<br />\nit is spreading all over the world. An<br />\nintellectual game,\" says Bob Gross, a<br />\nBiophysics graduate student and Go<br />\nenthusiast for the past two years,<br />\n\"because there is no luck involved.\"<br />\nThe game is played on a square board<br />\nsomething like a chess or checkers board.<br />\nexcept for the fact that the squares are<br />\n<br />\nsmaller, and not of contrasting colors.<br />\nThe game's object is to gain control of<br />\nmore territory than one's opponent. This<br />\nis done by placing stones, one at a time,<br />\non the intersections of the lines. In order<br />\nto achieve control over tern i ory, a player<br />\nmust surround it, encircling and capturing<br />\nall his opponents stones within.<br />\nGo, like chess, is a mixture of attack<br />\nand defense, invasion and retreat until no<br />\nmore moves can be made and one of the<br />\nplayers has won. It is unlike chess in that<br />\nthere is no limit to the amount of stones<br />\na player can use in the game. Another<br />\ncrucial difference between chess or<br />\ncheckers and Go is that the latter has a<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nTwo champion Go players to appear at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nfrightens you.\"), you will want to<br />\nremember how you felt instead of only<br />\nwhat happened.<br />\nAll the endless gossip about university<br />\naffairs (What courses are you taking?<br />\nWhere did he do his grad work'?) actually \u2022<br />\nwill end, and eventually a phrase such as<br />\n\"D level\" will fail to ring a very strong<br />\nbell in your head. It's as if you must<br />\nbecome a shell of yourself unless you-.<br />\nchoose never to leave.<br />\nRight now it seems important to try to<br />\nremember more than the phrases and the<br />\ngossip, but the important question is not<br />\nwhether you will remember but whether<br />\nyou should be afraid of not remembering.<br />\nAfter all, Honor Society inductions and<br />\nHomecoming were worth remembering at<br />\nanother time. At another time it was all<br />\nvery clear what was important to<br />\nremember.<br />\n<br />\nhandicap system where a less experienced<br />\nplayer may get the advantage of placing<br />\nup to nine stones on the board before the<br />\ngame begins.<br />\nGo will come to Hopkins this weekend,<br />\nin the form of a traveling pair of Japanese<br />\nchampions who are in the midst of a<br />\nnationwide tour. The two players,<br />\nYoshiaka Nagahara and Ichigen Okubo<br />\nwill show a movie describing the game<br />\nand explain it during three sessions in<br />\nShaffer 3 Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and<br />\nSunday at 1:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The<br />\ntour is being organized by the Japanese<br />\nMinistry of Education and will take the<br />\ntwo to Canada, the West Coast and<br />\nHawaii before it is done.<br />\nGross organized the event at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nbecause he hopes to increase the<br />\npopularity of Go in Baltimore and<br />\neventually establishing a club devoted to<br />\nit. In Japan, there are Go clubs in most<br />\ntowns with populations of 3000 to 4000.<br />\nThe game is growing in popularity with<br />\nGermans and became established in<br />\nYugoslavia after a brief wrangle with a<br />\ncertain government minister. Upon being<br />\nasked to approve the introduction of Go<br />\ninto the country, the mister said, \"We<br />\nalready have chess in this country, and we<br />\ndo not need another game.\" But he<br />\nrelented and gave his approval when he<br />\nwas told, \"In Go, all the pieces are equal,<br />\nwhile in chess some of the pieces are<br />\nmore powerful than others. Go is the true<br />\ngame of the proletariat.\"<br />\n<br />\ncomplicated: It a photon (an energy<br />\nparticle, says the Oatien( Dr. Henry) of<br />\nultraviolet light runs into a hydrogen<br />\natom with sufficient energy, the<br />\nhydrogen becomes ionized. If there's<br />\nenough energy in the Coma Cluster to<br />\nionize all the hydrogen that some<br />\nastronomers believe is there, then the<br />\nmass that is needed to counteract the<br />\ncentrifugal forces could exist. The mass<br />\nwould be in the form of the free electrons<br />\nand protons which are the end product of<br />\nionized hydrogen atoms.<br />\nThe last technical matter is the most<br />\nimportant and the one which again ties<br />\nup with Hopkins. The camera on-board<br />\nthe Apollo capsule will be able to record<br />\nthe presence of the particular kind ol<br />\nultraviolet light which hydrogen ions emit<br />\nwhen they re-combine.<br />\nIf the camera detects the right kind<br />\nand quantity of ultraviolet light, then the<br />\nmystery of why so-little mass in the<br />\nCosma Cluster has so-far been detected<br />\nwill be solved. If you ask what happens if<br />\nthe ultraviolet is not detected, -the<br />\nprofessors answer,\"That will just leave us<br />\nwith a myster, and the meaning of the<br />\nmystery won't be immediately apparent.\"<br />\n\"I don't think that there are any other<br />\ngood or easy explanations for the<br />\nsituation,\" added Henry. \"Even the<br />\nexplanation we're investigating is a little<br />\nstrange. There's no easy means that we<br />\ncan see that can ionize the hydrogen.\"<br />\nFastie and Henry traveled to the<br />\nManned Space Craft Center in Houston,<br />\nand they say that the astronauts will have<br />\nto turn the space craft around during<br />\ntheir return to earth in order for the<br />\ncamera to do its job.<br />\nProfessor Henry was a happy man<br />\nwhile talking about the experiemtn, and<br />\nthe bulletin board outside Fastie's office<br />\nis filled with clippings about the flight.<br />\nIt's safe to say that several people in<br />\nRowland will have more than a casual<br />\ninterest in the results of the next NASA<br />\nexpedition.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 8/ne.ws;1etter/$eptember 8, 1972<br />\n<br />\nbig appletight<br />\nFRIDAY,SEPTEMBER 8<br />\n<br />\nSATURDAY,SEPTEMBER 9<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nDetroit and Baltimore at<br />\nMemorial Stadium, 7:30 PM.<br />\n<br />\nSPORTS<br />\nMilwaukee and Baltimore at<br />\nMemorial Stadium, 5:30 PM.<br />\n<br />\nEXHIBITS<br />\nBaltimore Museum of Art, Art<br />\nMuseum Drive, closed only on<br />\nMonday works by William de<br />\nKooning Walters Art Gallery,<br />\nCharles and Center Streets, open<br />\nevery day Impressionistic<br />\npaintings from the permanent<br />\ncollection.<br />\nSPECTACLE<br />\nRod Stewart at the Civic Center.<br />\nTickets for $6.50, $5.50, and<br />\nS4.50.

The Coach also<br />\ndispatched any rumors that<br />\nNolan would be shiftedto<br />\nmidfield this spring. \"Nolan has<br />\nestablished himself as an<br />\nattackman, \" Scott remarked,<br />\nand readily admitted he has every<br />\nintention of keeping him there.<br />\nTwo reserves also were cited<br />\nfor outstanding work in the<br />\nplayoffs. Mike Perez \"carried a<br />\ngood share of the offensive load\"<br />\nby spelling Thomas and Nolan<br />\nfor six quarters and notching two<br />\ngoals and four assists. Bob<br />\nBarbera, used as a wing<br />\nmidfielder on faceoffs against<br />\nMaryland, did a superb job of<br />\nhatcheting the Terps' Gary<br />\nBesosa into submission. In the<br />\nfirst Maryland game, Besosa<br />\ncontrolled an unbelievable 17<br />\nfaceoffs, but the rematch, thanks<br />\nlargely to Barbera, saw Hopkins<br />\ntake 11 of 18.<br />\n<br />\nafter which Perez easily fed<br />\nThomas for Hopkins' eighth goal.<br />\nFreshman Billy McCutcheon<br />\ntallied the game's only fourth<br />\nperiod score, racing from center<br />\nfield after picking off an errant<br />\npass from Tom Goucher.

Uninspiring lectures that repeat<br />\nwhat is covered in boring textbooks,<br />\nbusywork that is called homework or lab,<br />\nbooks to be read so quickly that they<br />\nmust be skimmed, tests and quizzes that<br />\ndisrupt both sleep and learning, and,<br />\nworst of all, apathy about academic work<br />\nin general. To a naive observer, Hopkins<br />\nwould appear to be in desperate need of<br />\neducational reform. Yet when attempts<br />\nare made by the administration to find<br />\nout what the students want, they<br />\ninvariably discover that a majority of<br />\nthem are satisfied with what Hopkins has<br />\nto offer, while the remainder want minor<br />\nchanges, such as the size of classes,<br />\nnumber of seminars offered, or the type<br />\nof grading system used.<br />\nI would like to suggest that a possible<br />\nreason for .this disparity is that when<br />\nasked What is wrong with Hopkins, most<br />\nstudents limit their thinking to everyday<br />\nmatters, such as the ininber of tests<br />\ngiven. As a result of _this. they enncludp<br /><br />\nlist all of the resources that they can<br />\nprovide for the students. It would then be<br />\nup to each student to decide what to do<br />\nwith the opportunities.<br />\nThus students will find that they must \u2022<br />\nask themselves \"what is personally worth<br />\nlearning?'(Some may find that they do<br />\nnot want to learn anything; hopefully,<br />\nthey would have the sense to drop out<br />\ninstead of resort to being taught.)<br />\nPersonally committing oneself to learning<br />\nsomething, be it calculus, film-making or<br />\nwhatever, means that the classic problem<br />\nof motivating the student is solved,<br />\neliminating the need for the rewards,<br />\npunishments, and threats currently used<br />\nto force students to \"learn\".<br />\nAfter deciding what he will learn, the<br />\nstudent must determine how he will<br />\nlearn. Some students may feel that they<br />\ncan best learn by means of a lecture. It<br />\nwould then become their responsibility to<br />\ncontact professors and try to organize a<br />\nlecture. Hopefully, most students would<br /><br />\nthat there is nothing radically wrong with<br />\nHopkins, nothing that caCt be fixed by<br /><br />\ninefficient and<br /><br />\nsome minor alterations such as offering<br />\nfresh men seminars.<br />\nTo some students, however, there is<br />\nsomething terribly wrong with Hopkins,<br />\nsomething transcending the everday<br />\nroutine. What is fundamentally wrong is<br />\nthe failure of students, faculty, and<br />\nadministrators to realize that the<br />\nindividual should be personally<br />\nresponsible for his own education. This<br />\nmatter is related to a larger issue affecting<br />\nthe whole of our culture.<br />\n\u2022 Many critiques of modern society have<br />\nnoted that we live in a technocracy where<br />\n\"experts\" have the final say in most<br />\nmatters concerning our lives. For<br />\nexample, \"experts\" decide where new<br />\nhospitals and roads are to be built, often<br />\nwithout consulting the persons who are<br />\nto be displaced by them. Such rule by<br />\nexperts is accepted by many people. On<br />\nthe other hand, few persons would allow<br />\na nutritionist to dictate what they should<br />\neat, or a doctor to tell them when to go<br />\nto sleep or how to conduct their sex life.<br />\nThis is because we believe in individual<br />\ncontrol regarding how we use our bodies,<br />\nwhat we may say, feel, or think. But<br />\nstrangely enough, millions of college<br />\nstudents accept a violation of their basic<br />\nrights in submitting to the compulsory<br />\nlearning that goes on in school.<br />\nWe are told and accept that<br />\neducational experts. such as our<br />\nprofessors, know what is best for us to<br />\nlearn and how we should learn what they<br />\nhave selected for us. Yet research<br />\nconducted by some of these same<br />\nprofessors shows that we usually learn<br />\nbest when we learn on our own; that is,<br />\nwhen we are internally motivated.<br />\nOf course, we are given some choice we can choose between prepackaged<br />\neducational units that we may consumer.<br />\nBut just as choosing between CBS. NBC.<br />\nand ABC is really no choice at all, so it is<br />\nwith the various courses offered to<br />\nstudents.<br />\nIf one accepts this basic premise,<br />\nnamely, that just as the college student is<br />\nmature enough to decide how long his<br />\nhair will be, to decide what clothes he<br />\nwill wear, so should he be given the<br />\n'responsibility to learn what he wants to<br />\nand how he wants to; then a radically<br />\n,new view of education appears.<br />\nFor example, it no longer appears<br />\ninsance to suggest, as Postman and<br />\n'Weingarten do, that students run a<br />\n'University. Nor does it seem farfetched to<br />\n'suggest that we can desChool society, as<br />\n'advocated by Ivan Illich, without causing<br />\ndisastrous results.<br />\nIn practice what does assuming<br />\npersonal control over one's education<br />\nmean? It would mean that students<br />\nwould be required to take a more active<br />\n'role in their college career. Instead of<br />\n:professors offering courses, they might<br /><br />\nn<br /><br />\n_ ict.st<br />\n_<br /><br />\n_tre.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins entered by the Freshman this week is<br />\nfar different from the Hopkins of even a year ago.<br />\nEntering students were greeted with an enthusiasm<br />\nuncommon here. This more cordial greeting marks the<br />\nbeginning of a new perception of the non-academic<br />\nneeds of students here. The appointment of Robert<br />\nFitzpatrick as Dean of Students is indicative of a new<br />\nconcern for student welfare on the part of the<br />\nadministration. And the success of the Orientation<br />\nprogram shows that careful and concerted action by<br />\nstudents can do much to improve their lot. If this<br />\natmosphere of cooperation and committment<br />\ncontinues throughout the year, then Hopkins will no<br />\nlonger by cynically labeled as a haven for Ivy League<br />\nrejects and cut-throat competitive pre-meds.<br />\nThe improved atmosphere on campus shows that<br />\nstudents, faculty and administration all have more to<br />\ngain by working with each other than by jealousy<br />\nguarding their own prerogatives. Until recently,<br />\nHopkins was a declining as a university. The apparent<br />\nreversal of this trend may make a Hopkins that<br />\nstudents \u2018vill not regret having chosen.<br /><br />\n\u2022 ii<br /><br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nAt first it's all very clear. No one is<br />\nexempt from the new set of pressures;<br />\nand, as newcomers, people must try to<br />\nre-establish personalities. In that sense<br />\nthere is equality.<br />\nEvery year Housemasters have stories<br />\nof people being very genuinely surprised<br />\nthat no one else knows or cares whether<br />\nor not they were the Homecoming Queen<br />\nor in the Honor Society. The first few<br />\nweeks at Hopkins make home look really<br />\ngood. When you were there you could<br />\nknow who you were.<br />\nOhhh yeah--Even though you weren't<br />\nactually unhappy at Hopkins, it was<br />\nfantastic to get back home. Good 'ol<br />\nfriends in Cleveland or Roanoke or<br />\nanywhere are still good 'ol friends at<br />\nThanksgiving and Christmas. And Jenny<br />\nnever looked so attractive. Or John was<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nH<br /><br />\ninstruction. It would seem probable that<br />\nsome students would organize their own<br />\nseminars, or what Illicit calls<br />\n\"peer-matching\". Others would probably<br />\nbe content to learn from books or field<br />\nexperiences and by-pass the faculty<br />\ncompletely.their interest cannot be<br />\npredicted or guaranteed. Thus, the nation<br />\nthat topics are covered in a term's worth<br />\nof work would be discredited. Students<br />\nwould also realize that because of the<br />\nrelatedness of knowledge, studying one<br />\ntopic often leads to interest in another<br />\none, and therefore would not confine<br />\nthemselves to a rigid curriculum.<br />\nIn sum, the implications of a student .<br />\nrun university are as far ranging as they<br />\nare important.<br />\nOpinion is everybody's voice in the<br />\nNews-Letter.

They are all in what is called<br />\nthe Cosma Cluster, which is located in the<br />\nconstellation Coma Berenices. The cluster<br />\nis calculated to be only (\"only\" for<br />\nastronomers) two billion years old, while<br />\nthe universe is generally believed to be<br />\ngoing on 10 billion years.<br />\nTextbooks say that Coma Berenices is<br />\nnorth of Virgo and .between Bootes and<br />\nLeo, but a layman writer said, \"It's<br />\nindescribably huge and unthinkably<br />\ndistant.\" Both descriptions mean that<br />\nwe're dependent on the good professors<br /><br />\nfor any possible explanations.<br />\nSome of tbe galaxies in the cluster are<br />\nmoving at the speed of 1,000 kilometers a<br />\nsecond, which is 2.2 million miles an<br />\nhour. Now, this speed means there's a lot<br />\nof centrifugal force. And according to the<br />\nlaws of physics, gravitational force (which<br />\nis determined by the mass in the system,'<br />\nwill balance the centrifugal force in a<br />\nstable system. Astronomers have not been<br />\nable to detect more than one-seventh of<br />\nthe mass which would be needed to<br />\nprevent the gast moving galaxies in the<br />\nCosma Cluster from tearing themselves<br />\napart. Which means the cluster is<br />\ndisintegrating.<br />\nThis is where the Hopkins people<br />\nenter. Dr. Fastie, who is an atmospherics<br />\nexpert, has designed a very special camera<br />\nwhich will be on board Apollo 17 in<br />\nDecember. The unit will be able to detect<br />\nhigh-energy ultraviolet light,. and that<br />\nlight is the most important ingredient in<br /><br />\nthe astronomers' explanation for the<br />\nmissing mass.<br />\nThe explanation of explanation is<br /><br />\nGo to come to Hopkins this weekend<br />\nBy RICHARD WARING<br />\nIt is the oldest game in the world,<br />\ndating from 2000 B. C. when it was<br />\nplayed by Chinese Royalty, long before<br />\nchess or checkers was invented. It is<br />\ncalled Go and it takes five minutes to<br />\nlearn and years to master.<br />\nNow predominately a Japanese game,<br />\nit is spreading all over the world. An<br />\nintellectual game,\" says Bob Gross, a<br />\nBiophysics graduate student and Go<br />\nenthusiast for the past two years,<br />\n\"because there is no luck involved.\"<br />\nThe game is played on a square board<br />\nsomething like a chess or checkers board.<br />\nexcept for the fact that the squares are<br /><br />\nsmaller, and not of contrasting colors.<br />\nThe game's object is to gain control of<br />\nmore territory than one's opponent. This<br />\nis done by placing stones, one at a time,<br />\non the intersections of the lines. In order<br />\nto achieve control over tern i ory, a player<br />\nmust surround it, encircling and capturing<br />\nall his opponents stones within.<br />\nGo, like chess, is a mixture of attack<br />\nand defense, invasion and retreat until no<br />\nmore moves can be made and one of the<br />\nplayers has won. It is unlike chess in that<br />\nthere is no limit to the amount of stones<br />\na player can use in the game. Another<br />\ncrucial difference between chess or<br />\ncheckers and Go is that the latter has a<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTwo champion Go players to appear at Hopkins<br /><br />\nfrightens you.\"), you will want to<br />\nremember how you felt instead of only<br />\nwhat happened.<br />\nAll the endless gossip about university<br />\naffairs (What courses are you taking?<br />\nWhere did he do his grad work'?) actually \u2022<br />\nwill end, and eventually a phrase such as<br />\n\"D level\" will fail to ring a very strong<br />\nbell in your head. It's as if you must<br />\nbecome a shell of yourself unless you-.<br />\nchoose never to leave.<br />\nRight now it seems important to try to<br />\nremember more than the phrases and the<br />\ngossip, but the important question is not<br />\nwhether you will remember but whether<br />\nyou should be afraid of not remembering.<br />\nAfter all, Honor Society inductions and<br />\nHomecoming were worth remembering at<br />\nanother time.

The two players,<br />\nYoshiaka Nagahara and Ichigen Okubo<br />\nwill show a movie describing the game<br />\nand explain it during three sessions in<br />\nShaffer 3 Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and<br />\nSunday at 1:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. The<br />\ntour is being organized by the Japanese<br />\nMinistry of Education and will take the<br />\ntwo to Canada, the West Coast and<br />\nHawaii before it is done.<br />\nGross organized the event at Hopkins<br /><br />\nbecause he hopes to increase the<br />\npopularity of Go in Baltimore and<br />\neventually establishing a club devoted to<br />\nit. In Japan, there are Go clubs in most<br />\ntowns with populations of 3000 to 4000.<br />\nThe game is growing in popularity with<br />\nGermans and became established in<br />\nYugoslavia after a brief wrangle with a<br />\ncertain government minister. Upon being<br />\nasked to approve the introduction of Go<br />\ninto the country, the mister said, \"We<br />\nalready have chess in this country, and we<br />\ndo not need another game.\" But he<br />\nrelented and gave his approval when he<br />\nwas told, \"In Go, all the pieces are equal,<br />\nwhile in chess some of the pieces are<br />\nmore powerful than others. Go is the true<br />\ngame of the proletariat.\"<br /><br />\ncomplicated: It a photon (an energy<br />\nparticle, says the Oatien( Dr. Henry) of<br />\nultraviolet light runs into a hydrogen<br />\natom with sufficient energy, the<br />\nhydrogen becomes ionized. If there's<br />\nenough energy in the Coma Cluster to<br />\nionize all the hydrogen that some<br />\nastronomers believe is there, then the<br />\nmass that is needed to counteract the<br />\ncentrifugal forces could exist.
