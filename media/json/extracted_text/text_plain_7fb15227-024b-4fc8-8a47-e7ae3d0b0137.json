Down in the town we met a<br />\ndozen or more of these men. Great, stalwart<br />\nfellows they were, their thin running suits, with<br />\ngolf stockings rolled down below a bare knee,<br />\nand their light, vertically striped jackets, devoid<br />\nof all padding, marking them in vivid contrast<br />\nto the foot-ball warriors on this side of the<br />\nwater. Though apparently very young, they<br />\nnearly all wore moustaches, and their stocky<br />\nbuild and sturdy demeanor as they swung in a<br />\nbody through the midst of thc town and across<br />\nthe bridge leading to the college,impressed us as<br />\ntypifying the physical glory of young English<br />\nmanhood. Followed by a crowd of admiring<br />\ntownsboys, they tramped up one of the streets<br />\nof the little town and finally disappeared behind<br />\nthe doors of a wine shop, leaving me with the<br />\nsudden recollection that these men had been<br />\nclothed in shirts of black and blue, the first time<br />\nthat I had ever seen or heard of that combination of colors as a college emblem outside of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nAll along the street leading up to the college<br />\nlittle shops displayed pictures offoot-ball teams,<br />\nand winning eights, and views of college ceremonies and entertainments, together with lots<br />\nof little painted jugs and mantel ornaments all<br />\n<br />\nNo. 6,<br />\n<br />\nbearing the motto, Floreat Etona, and little<br />\nboys in tall hats and round collars and wearing<br />\nthose same \"Eton jackets,\" that we see sometimes a part of ladies' dresses, looked in at the<br />\nwindows from time to time as they walked in<br />\ngroups with their hands in their pockets or<br />\ntwisting the enormous watch chains which<br />\nhung down over their waistcoats.<br />\nPassing from the road through an archway<br />\nwe come to the quadrangle, called the schoolyard, although it is roughly paved with cobblestones and its only ornamentation is a statue of<br />\nHenry VI. in the centre. One of the gloomy<br />\ndoorways around this yard was open, and a<br />\ngroup of students, some wearing gowns, were<br />\npassing in very slowly to recitation, nearly every<br />\none taking a last fond look at his page as he<br />\ncrossed the forbidding threshold.

The men then<br />\nproceeded to show by their vigorous and welldirected rooting how much they loved the<br />\nCharlestown people and admired their team.<br />\nThis manner of advertising had the desired effect<br />\nand the concert hall was well filled.<br />\nFrom Charlestown the Clubs went to Winchester, Va., where they were received by a full<br />\nhouse. Many of.those in the audience were<br />\ninclined to be very sparing in their applause, but<br />\nafter hearing \"Dixie,\" by the Banjo Club, and a<br />\nfew of Swindell's songs, they became much more<br />\nenthusiastic. The reason for this apparent lack<br />\nof interest was because two years ago the Hopkins Clubs had given a very poor concert and<br />\nthe audience feared a repetition. But this year's<br />\nconcert has entirely changed their opinion of the<br />\nClubs and the audience next year will no doubt<br />\nbe much larger and more appreciative. Then<br />\nfollowed a dance with refreshments given by the<br />\nyouth and beauty of Winchester. The next<br />\nmorning or rather the same morning, for the<br />\ndance did not stop till 2 a. in., the men took the<br />\nsix o'clock train for Hagerstown. The concert<br />\nthere was also far better than was ever given<br />\nbefore and yill help to increase the audience the<br />\nnext time the Hopkins Clubs go to Hagerstown.<br />\nImmediately after the concert the hall was<br />\ncleared and the men enjoyed the last dance of the<br />\nChristmas trip. The next morning, December<br />\n29, found the Clubs once more on the train<br />\njourneying toward home.<br />\nThe whole trip was a thorough success, and<br />\nnot a man on the Clubs would have missed it,<br />\nno matter if it had cost twice as much.<br />\nE.

The<br />\nundergraduate mind disburdens itself of about<br />\nthree-fourths of the knowledge hastily acquired<br />\nduring the two or three days prior to the examinations, and begins once more to occupy itself<br />\nwith the more pressing interests of the lounging<br />\nroom, the slot machine and Walter's tonsorial<br />\nclinics in the basement.<br />\nMeanwhile a considerable element twangs the<br />\nmelodious guitar every afternoon in McCoy<br />\nHall,and craves the indulgentfavor of the whole<br />\nUniversity on Friday night. Lately returned<br />\nfrom the joys of Western Virginia and the plaudits of the fair, they feel the inspiration of success.

This neglect is<br />\noften without any valid excuse. A few,perhaps,<br />\ncannot leave duties at or awayfrom the University; but there are some men who would prefer<br />\nto sit in the barber shop with nothing to do but<br />\nsmoke a pipe and watch the victim in the chair<br />\nthan listen for a few minutes to a lecture<br />\nupstairs, which many are perhaps paying a<br />\ngood price to hear.

We<br />\nobserve that when an astronomer gives out<br />\ndefinite information regarding the neighboring<br />\nplanets, Mars is always the one chosen. When<br />\nan author has exhausted every other topic he<br />\ncan think of (to say nothing of his readers) he<br />\nmixes up a bit of whisky and absinthe, and the<br />\nresult is a story about Mars. This is manifestly<br />\nunjust, for we believe that some of the other<br />\nplanets should come in for a share of this attention. For instance, Venus, whom we imagine,<br />\nwould be equally as interesting (if not more so)<br />\nthan the fiery god of war.<br />\nBut we anticipate; let us wait a kw weeks<br />\nlonger and perhaps the next communication<br />\nfrom Tesla will tell us that his invention has<br />\neliminated space and that we may proceed to<br />\nbecome acquainted with the inhabitants of the<br />\nsurrounding planets.<br />\nAt times we shall be awakened from our contemplations by the merry tinkle of the planetophone bell, and then\u2014\"John, dear, come to the<br />\n'phone.

Down in the town we met a<br />\ndozen or more of these men. Great, stalwart<br />\nfellows they were, their thin running suits, with<br />\ngolf stockings rolled down below a bare knee,<br />\nand their light, vertically striped jackets, devoid<br />\nof all padding, marking them in vivid contrast<br />\nto the foot-ball warriors on this side of the<br />\nwater. Though apparently very young, they<br />\nnearly all wore moustaches, and their stocky<br />\nbuild and sturdy demeanor as they swung in a<br />\nbody through the midst of thc town and across<br />\nthe bridge leading to the college,impressed us as<br />\ntypifying the physical glory of young English<br />\nmanhood. Followed by a crowd of admiring<br />\ntownsboys, they tramped up one of the streets<br />\nof the little town and finally disappeared behind<br />\nthe doors of a wine shop, leaving me with the<br />\nsudden recollection that these men had been<br />\nclothed in shirts of black and blue, the first time<br />\nthat I had ever seen or heard of that combination of colors as a college emblem outside of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nAll along the street leading up to the college<br />\nlittle shops displayed pictures offoot-ball teams,<br />\nand winning eights, and views of college ceremonies and entertainments, together with lots<br />\nof little painted jugs and mantel ornaments all<br /><br />\nNo. 6,<br /><br />\nbearing the motto, Floreat Etona, and little<br />\nboys in tall hats and round collars and wearing<br />\nthose same \"Eton jackets,\" that we see sometimes a part of ladies' dresses, looked in at the<br />\nwindows from time to time as they walked in<br />\ngroups with their hands in their pockets or<br />\ntwisting the enormous watch chains which<br />\nhung down over their waistcoats.<br />\nPassing from the road through an archway<br />\nwe come to the quadrangle, called the schoolyard, although it is roughly paved with cobblestones and its only ornamentation is a statue of<br />\nHenry VI. in the centre.

The men then<br />\nproceeded to show by their vigorous and welldirected rooting how much they loved the<br />\nCharlestown people and admired their team.<br />\nThis manner of advertising had the desired effect<br />\nand the concert hall was well filled.<br />\nFrom Charlestown the Clubs went to Winchester, Va., where they were received by a full<br />\nhouse. Many of.those in the audience were<br />\ninclined to be very sparing in their applause, but<br />\nafter hearing \"Dixie,\" by the Banjo Club, and a<br />\nfew of Swindell's songs, they became much more<br />\nenthusiastic. The reason for this apparent lack<br />\nof interest was because two years ago the Hopkins Clubs had given a very poor concert and<br />\nthe audience feared a repetition. But this year's<br />\nconcert has entirely changed their opinion of the<br />\nClubs and the audience next year will no doubt<br />\nbe much larger and more appreciative. Then<br />\nfollowed a dance with refreshments given by the<br />\nyouth and beauty of Winchester. The next<br />\nmorning or rather the same morning, for the<br />\ndance did not stop till 2 a. in., the men took the<br />\nsix o'clock train for Hagerstown.

The next morning, December<br />\n29, found the Clubs once more on the train<br />\njourneying toward home.<br />\nThe whole trip was a thorough success, and<br />\nnot a man on the Clubs would have missed it,<br />\nno matter if it had cost twice as much.<br />\nE.

The<br />\nundergraduate mind disburdens itself of about<br />\nthree-fourths of the knowledge hastily acquired<br />\nduring the two or three days prior to the examinations, and begins once more to occupy itself<br />\nwith the more pressing interests of the lounging<br />\nroom, the slot machine and Walter's tonsorial<br />\nclinics in the basement.<br />\nMeanwhile a considerable element twangs the<br />\nmelodious guitar every afternoon in McCoy<br />\nHall,and craves the indulgentfavor of the whole<br />\nUniversity on Friday night. Lately returned<br />\nfrom the joys of Western Virginia and the plaudits of the fair, they feel the inspiration of success.

This is one of the features of the University year which is of greatest interest to educated people of the city, and should be to the<br />\nstudents here. But strangely this is not the<br />\ncase.

This neglect is<br />\noften without any valid excuse. A few,perhaps,<br />\ncannot leave duties at or awayfrom the University; but there are some men who would prefer<br />\nto sit in the barber shop with nothing to do but<br />\nsmoke a pipe and watch the victim in the chair<br />\nthan listen for a few minutes to a lecture<br />\nupstairs, which many are perhaps paying a<br />\ngood price to hear.

From his<br />\nobservatory perched upon the top of the mountains of Colorado, comes the startling information that the learned professor has put himself<br />\nin communication with the planet Mars! The<br />\nnineteenth century has witnessed the birth of<br />\nmany inventions and discoveries, but lo! the<br />\ncoming era is to surpass them all.<br />\nHow our ideas will broaden by -coming into<br />\ncontact with the minds of the men of Mars, provided they are a people of advanced civilization,<br />\nbut if, on the other hand, they are benighted<br />\nheathens, it will be our plain duty to benevolently assimilate them, and introduce them to<br />\nthe two great blessings of our advanced civilization\u2014fire water and gunpowder.<br />\nApropos of the present situation, a question<br />\ncomes up that we find difficult to answer. We<br />\nobserve that when an astronomer gives out<br />\ndefinite information regarding the neighboring<br />\nplanets, Mars is always the one chosen. When<br />\nan author has exhausted every other topic he<br />\ncan think of (to say nothing of his readers) he<br />\nmixes up a bit of whisky and absinthe, and the<br />\nresult is a story about Mars. This is manifestly<br />\nunjust, for we believe that some of the other<br />\nplanets should come in for a share of this attention. For instance, Venus, whom we imagine,<br />\nwould be equally as interesting (if not more so)<br />\nthan the fiery god of war.<br />\nBut we anticipate; let us wait a kw weeks<br />\nlonger and perhaps the next communication<br />\nfrom Tesla will tell us that his invention has<br />\neliminated space and that we may proceed to<br />\nbecome acquainted with the inhabitants of the<br />\nsurrounding planets.<br />\nAt times we shall be awakened from our contemplations by the merry tinkle of the planetophone bell, and then\u2014\"John, dear, come to the<br />\n'phone.

The natural grace with which<br />\nhe glides through the dreamy waltz is only excelled by the good-natured sangfroid with which<br />\nhe peddles ginger ale at ten cents per bottle. So<br />\nwhy shouldn't he run an elevator? Why, indeed?<br />\nHe seized a rope and gave a mighty pull. No<br />\nresult. Then he gave a great haul in the other<br />\ndirection.

Things had reached a point where desperate measures were necessary. So,as we strolled<br />\nalong Charlestown's quiet streets, we informed<br />\nhim that he must go with us to a barber, dead<br />\nor alive, and get a shave. He bolted, and<br />\nstarted to run for the hotel, with the same natural instinct that prompted his eloquent namesake to run twice for the presidency\u2014and with<br />\nthe same success.<br />\nAfter we had carried him half a square in the<br />\ngraceful and easy position of the summer girl's<br />\nhammock,he agreed to go peaceably,if we would<br />\nput him on his feet.
