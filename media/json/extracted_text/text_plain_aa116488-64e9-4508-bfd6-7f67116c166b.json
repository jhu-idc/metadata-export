It merely wanted certain information which<br />\nwould tell them exactly how each<br />\nfaculty member is applying the Honor system in his course. The questrennaires which were used to obtain this information had specific<br />\nand clear instructions stating that<br />\nthe Council was not requesting any<br />\nadditional regulation, although many<br />\nof the students seem to feel that this<br />\nhas been an outcome.<br />\nThe Council, recognizing the necessity for complete faculty support in<br />\na measure of this type, did urge the<br />\nfaculty members to be explicit in<br />\nthe instances where they did intend<br />\nto apply the Honor system; and it<br />\ndid demand that they announce to<br />\ntheir classes all of these instances.<br />\n'Dere are many reasons for the<br />\noccurrence of this action. Some of<br />\nthese are as follows:<br />\n<br />\n(1) The Council feels not only<br />\nthat the Honor system is taken for<br />\ngranted to the extent of causing the<br />\nstudents to relax their appreciation<br />\nof it, but also that the Honor system<br />\n,<br />\nmust be repeatedly brought to the at<br />\ntention of both the students and the<br />\nTh<br />\n:h .<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nagc(;I<br />\nn<br />\nif<br />\ne Council feels that by hayrequested information it can<br />\nmore successfully uphold the Honor<br />\nsystem in cases of alleged infraction<br />\nand thereby conic closer to administering justice, promoting the practice of honorable conduct, and causing the exclusion of undesirable students ( because of their failure to<br />\nuphold the Honor system) from the<br />\ncampus.<br />\ne Council hopes that the<br />\n(3)<br />\nstudents* will seize upon any and all<br />\nopportunities to approach their instructors and professors; and it feels<br />\nthat by stressing the importance of<br />\nfaculty cooperation in this vital matter pertaining to student welfare, it<br />\ncan thereby close the gap between<br />\nthese two groups. The students and<br />\nthe faculty must be made to sense<br />\nthe mutual responsibility involved.<br />\n(4) The Council wants to do all in<br />\nits power to inculcate full studentwide support of the Honor system.<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col 1),<br />\n<br />\nV,<br />\nfx<br />\nS,<br />\nti<br />\nis<br />\nrr<br />\ntc<br />\na<br />\nfr<br />\nis<br />\ngl<br />\nex<br />\nel<br />\nti<br />\ntu<br />\n141<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nCf<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col 3)<br />\n<br />\n-Th<br />\n<br />\nA Goal Attained<br />\nThe Cotillion board has been trying for many years to comply with<br />\nthe wishes of many Hopkins men<br />\nand makes its big name dances closed<br />\nto the general public, The Ellington<br />\ndance, except for twelve couples who<br />\nbought tickets in the hour dutEing<br />\nwhich they<br />\nwas dosed to ay. but Hopkins students.

It merely wanted certain information which<br />\nwould tell them exactly how each<br />\nfaculty member is applying the Honor system in his course. The questrennaires which were used to obtain this information had specific<br />\nand clear instructions stating that<br />\nthe Council was not requesting any<br />\nadditional regulation, although many<br />\nof the students seem to feel that this<br />\nhas been an outcome.<br />\nThe Council, recognizing the necessity for complete faculty support in<br />\na measure of this type, did urge the<br />\nfaculty members to be explicit in<br />\nthe instances where they did intend<br />\nto apply the Honor system; and it<br />\ndid demand that they announce to<br />\ntheir classes all of these instances.<br />\n'Dere are many reasons for the<br />\noccurrence of this action. Some of<br />\nthese are as follows:<br /><br />\n(1) The Council feels not only<br />\nthat the Honor system is taken for<br />\ngranted to the extent of causing the<br />\nstudents to relax their appreciation<br />\nof it, but also that the Honor system<br />\n,<br />\nmust be repeatedly brought to the at<br />\ntention of both the students and the<br />\nTh<br />\n:h .<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nagc(;I<br />\nn<br />\nif<br />\ne Council feels that by hayrequested information it can<br />\nmore successfully uphold the Honor<br />\nsystem in cases of alleged infraction<br />\nand thereby conic closer to administering justice, promoting the practice of honorable conduct, and causing the exclusion of undesirable students ( because of their failure to<br />\nuphold the Honor system) from the<br />\ncampus.<br />\ne Council hopes that the<br />\n(3)<br />\nstudents* will seize upon any and all<br />\nopportunities to approach their instructors and professors; and it feels<br />\nthat by stressing the importance of<br />\nfaculty cooperation in this vital matter pertaining to student welfare, it<br />\ncan thereby close the gap between<br />\nthese two groups. The students and<br />\nthe faculty must be made to sense<br />\nthe mutual responsibility involved.<br />\n(4) The Council wants to do all in<br />\nits power to inculcate full studentwide support of the Honor system.<br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col 1),<br /><br />\nV,<br />\nfx<br />\nS,<br />\nti<br />\nis<br />\nrr<br />\ntc<br />\na<br />\nfr<br />\nis<br />\ngl<br />\nex<br />\nel<br />\nti<br />\ntu<br />\n141<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nCf<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 4, Col 3)<br /><br />\n-Th<br /><br />\nA Goal Attained<br />\nThe Cotillion board has been trying for many years to comply with<br />\nthe wishes of many Hopkins men<br />\nand makes its big name dances closed<br />\nto the general public, The Ellington<br />\ndance, except for twelve couples who<br />\nbought tickets in the hour dutEing<br />\nwhich they<br />\nwas dosed to ay. but Hopkins students.
