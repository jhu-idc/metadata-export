Ross Veazey.<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of The News-Letter.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nIn writing- this it is my pleasure to<br />\nmake a few points tentative to the<br />\nproposed Honor System. The system may have several defects and<br />\nmany points which can be improved<br />\nupon, but considering it as a whole,<br />\nI think the adoption would be a vast<br />\nimprovement and a monument of lasting fame to our University.<br />\nMr. McCabe and myself have very<br />\ncarefully considered all points both<br />\npro and con. We have investigated<br />\nthe conditions at the University of<br />\nVirginia, Princeton University, and<br />\nat Williams College. A system very<br />\nsimilar to the above is in vogue at<br />\neach of these institutions.<br />\nAt<br />\nVirginia the system has been in constant use since the early days of the<br />\nschool. At Princeton it has worked<br />\nequally well. At Williams College,<br />\nsince 1896, the year of its introduction, it has gone on without a hitch.<br />\nIf the system has met with such success at each of these first-class schools,<br />\nwhy should it not succeed at Johns<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nIn an official capacity the faculty<br />\nhave not committed themselves, but<br />\nindividually every member with whom<br />\nI have spoken has been eager for the<br />\nadoption of the same. The faculty<br />\nwill not pass upon the proposed Honor System until each of the four<br />\nclasses have decided whether or not<br />\nthey are in favor of its adoption.<br />\nI sincerely trust that the plan will<br />\nreceive a favorable reception by all<br />\nthe classes and that the Honor System<br />\nwill soon be in use at our University.<br />\nIf for any reason the students see<br />\nfit not to accept the proposed system,<br />\nI think some other should be adopted. Indeed, I think it would be a serious reflection upon any University<br />\nof our standing for its undergraduate<br />\nmembers to turn down an honor system, without proposing and accepting<br />\na better system in its stead.<br />\nI further believe that the press<br />\nrepresentatives in our midst should<br />\nnot print anything relative to the proposed Honor System until this or<br />\nsome other system is adopted. For<br />\nin case no honor system is introduced, after all the notoriety attendant thereto, the reflection will be very<br />\nadverse to the reputation of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI thank you for your valuable space<br />\nand commit myself.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nEdmund B.

Ross Veazey.<br />\nEditor-in-Chief of The News-Letter.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nIn writing- this it is my pleasure to<br />\nmake a few points tentative to the<br />\nproposed Honor System. The system may have several defects and<br />\nmany points which can be improved<br />\nupon, but considering it as a whole,<br />\nI think the adoption would be a vast<br />\nimprovement and a monument of lasting fame to our University.<br />\nMr. McCabe and myself have very<br />\ncarefully considered all points both<br />\npro and con. We have investigated<br />\nthe conditions at the University of<br />\nVirginia, Princeton University, and<br />\nat Williams College. A system very<br />\nsimilar to the above is in vogue at<br />\neach of these institutions.<br />\nAt<br />\nVirginia the system has been in constant use since the early days of the<br />\nschool. At Princeton it has worked<br />\nequally well. At Williams College,<br />\nsince 1896, the year of its introduction, it has gone on without a hitch.<br />\nIf the system has met with such success at each of these first-class schools,<br />\nwhy should it not succeed at Johns<br />\nHopkins?<br />\nIn an official capacity the faculty<br />\nhave not committed themselves, but<br />\nindividually every member with whom<br />\nI have spoken has been eager for the<br />\nadoption of the same. The faculty<br />\nwill not pass upon the proposed Honor System until each of the four<br />\nclasses have decided whether or not<br />\nthey are in favor of its adoption.<br />\nI sincerely trust that the plan will<br />\nreceive a favorable reception by all<br />\nthe classes and that the Honor System<br />\nwill soon be in use at our University.<br />\nIf for any reason the students see<br />\nfit not to accept the proposed system,<br />\nI think some other should be adopted. Indeed, I think it would be a serious reflection upon any University<br />\nof our standing for its undergraduate<br />\nmembers to turn down an honor system, without proposing and accepting<br />\na better system in its stead.<br />\nI further believe that the press<br />\nrepresentatives in our midst should<br />\nnot print anything relative to the proposed Honor System until this or<br />\nsome other system is adopted. For<br />\nin case no honor system is introduced, after all the notoriety attendant thereto, the reflection will be very<br />\nadverse to the reputation of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nI thank you for your valuable space<br />\nand commit myself.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nEdmund B.
