Am I a good administrator? Do you have<br />\nconfidence in me? Do I know the tradition and goals of this<br />\nUniversity? If the answers to these questions are largely yes, then<br />\nyou don't have to worry about numbers. If not, then I should not<br />\nbe, and do not wish to remain, a dean of this University.<br />\n<br />\nCan you picture the scene: a middle-aged man leaning<br />\ntowards the lecture table in Remsen 1, eyes strained at<br />\nthe waves of chairs arching upwards, voice cracked just<br />\nenough to feign spontaneity? Yes, the George Benton<br />\nShow last Friday was a great soap opera. The faculty<br />\napplauded loud, several professors stood up, even a few<br />\ncried, \"We believe you.\"<br />\nBenton (color him Lancelot) now portrays himself as<br />\nthe unsong hero who led his professors against a fat,<br />\nfire-breathing Central Administration. Last November<br />\nthe dean brandished his sword at Homewood House by<br />\ndeclaring a ten per cent faculty reduction well-knowing<br />\nthat the faculty would demand similar cuts in the<br />\nCentral Administration. The crusade had begun, and<br />\nfour months later Gordon's Administration was<br />\ntrimmed the designated amount.<br />\nBut where does this now leave Dr. Benton? With very<br />\nunimpressive figures despite his maudlin rhetoric..<br />\nHomewood's budget has been cut 6.5 per cent--all in<br />\nAdministration--without even a look at the departments.<br />\nAnd it was the dean's timidness at investigating the<br />\nfaculty's own fiefdoms (that,as Biology currently shows,<br />\nalso contain a lot of wasted potential) which was<br />\nactually applauded on Friday.<br />\nBenton's adament refusal to disclose the expenditure<br />\nbreakdowns by department forbids everybody except<br />\nthe dean and maybe the Academic Council from<br />\nstudying whether Hopkins is pouring its money into the<br />\nright barrels. The University last year paid $3.8 million<br />\nout of its general funds to Homewood's science<br />\ndepartments and $2.9 million to the liberal arts even<br />\nthough the 4,000 full-time student population is divided<br />\nequally between the two areas. Within the next two<br />\nyears 23 full-time professors that were formerly<br />\nfinanced by foundation grants will have to be paid by the<br />\nUniversity, costing $500,000 extra annually. Have such<br />\nmatters been considered during the budget talks or<br />\ndiscarded by the push of immediate problems? Benton<br />\nhas indicated that he has not studied these questions<br />\nwhich is an indicator of Benton's success during his first<br />\n230 days.<br />\n<br />\n...And Talent<br />\nSo far during his reign, the dean has evinced a<br />\npropensity to criticize, yet a lack of creativity to<br />\napproach problems (outside budget hassles) in a fresh<br />\nmanner. His response to undergraduate education is to<br />\ncut enrollment and (again donning his mock-heroic<br />\nmask) \"personally persuade\" his faculty-friends to<br />\nteach more. When asked for more details to this rather<br />\nsimpleminded scheme, Benton replies like a recording:<br />\n\"This is a sensitive area ... this is a soft spot. . . one has<br />\nto proceed slowly.\" Such statements bring back<br />\nmemories of Kimball's do-nothing days. And since<br />\nBenton took over in July, his only educational<br />\ninnovations have been killing the Russian Program and<br />\nEducation Department, a mighty accomplishment!<br />\nDespite months of budget and parliamentary<br />\nmaneuvers, many critical questions have yet to be<br />\nexplored by the dean. Will Hopkins continue research at<br />\nthe expense of teaching? Will Homewood stay a mixedbag liberal arts school or become specialized in certain<br />\npursuits? Will classes be permitted to enlarge even<br />\nthough the student-faculty ratio has declined? George<br />\nBenton must address these and other problems<br />\nimmediately...and hopefully .without his purple prose.<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nSlow Death<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nthe<br />\nThursday<br />\nLast<br />\nTemporary Advisory Council<br />\nalmost went out of existence;<br />\na death that would have been<br />\nnoticed by few people other<br />\nthan the members. But it did<br />\nnot die. \"What if some crisis<br />\narose?\" We must have our<br />\npaper tiger to eat our paper<br />\ncrises.<br />\nIt is very typical of the<br />\nHomewood scene, that a<br />\ngroup which was never very<br />\neffective should seek to<br />\nmaintain some form of paper<br />\ncontinuity after three months<br />\nof inaction since the<br />\ngovernance proposals were<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\ndown<br />\nvoted<br />\ntime<br />\nthat<br />\nDuring<br />\nreferendum.<br />\nthe University was not<br />\ninactive.<br />\nThe faculty and graduate<br />\nstudents must realize that<br />\nthey are members of a<br />\nuniversity and not just a<br />\ndepartment or research<br />\ngroup.

It we do not do<br />\nour fair share to create the<br />\natmosphere of a community<br />\nof scholars, then we should<br />\nnot complain when things get<br />\ntense.<br />\nThe undergraduates must<br />\nrealize that the \"other side\"<br />\nhas a new captain.

A close<br />\ninspection reveals a great inattention to<br />\ndetails and facts, and consequently casts a<br />\nshadow over the recommendations. A few<br />\nexamples will best indicate why the report<br />\nshould undergo major revision.<br />\n(1) The majority of the committee would<br />\ndemand that one-third of the faculty teach a<br />\nseminar each term, but they possess no<br />\nevidence that seminars are better than large<br />\nclasses. Indeed, our hearings indicated that<br />\nseminars are best only for certain types of<br />\ncourse work at certain times in the student's<br />\ncareer. Furthermore, since the majority<br />\nmade no effort to study how a professor<br />\ndistributes his time, they can not tell us what<br />\nthe ramifications of such a demand might<br />\nbe.<br />\n(2) The committee made no effort to get an<br />\noverview ofteaching in the past several years.<br />\nThus they cannot suggest any trends in<br />\nundergraduate instruction. Second, their<br />\nsource of information for undergrad<br />\nofferings was the \"Schedule of Courses\" sent<br />\nout by the Registrar. There was no attempt<br />\nmade to correct the inadequacies of this<br />\npamphlet.<br />\n(3) Finally, I regret the committee did not<br />\ninvestigate the source of a professor's<br />\nsalary. As a consequence, the committee<br />\ndoes not know if those professors who have<br />\nnot taught recently were shared with other<br />\ndivisions, or were on leave, etc. As<br />\nmentioned before, they haven't even<br />\nresearched whether those \"negligent\"<br />\nprofessors were negligent last year....<br />\nThere is evidence that instruction at<br />\nHopkins is heavily overshadowed by a<br />\nSteve Ross is a junior in natural sciences.<br />\n<br />\ncombination of research and graduate<br />\nsupervision. Biology,for instance, has 22 fulltime professors averaging 0.8 courses per<br />\nterm<br />\nIndependent work in Biology has two<br />\nshortcoming. It is directed toward the<br />\nprofessors' research objectives; and there<br />\nisn't the manpower to serve all qualified<br />\nBiology<br />\nstudents. Might not the<br />\ntheir<br />\nof<br />\nuse<br />\ndepartment make better<br />\nresources if they offered, say, a Zoology<br />\ncourse to complement Development Biology,<br />\nMarine Biology, etc.? After all, Hopkins is<br />\nrated 8th in the nation in Zoology graduate<br />\nstudies.<br />\nThe above is not to say that the Biology<br />\nprogram is not good, what I believe is that<br />\nthere isn't enough of it. Current financing<br />\nmust demand that Biology and other<br />\ndepartments put out more, while asking less.<br />\nTo assist them in their housekeeping I<br />\npropose:<br />\n(1) Hopkins should formulate a set of bylaws that would delineate power and<br />\nresponsibilities. Additionally, the Academic<br />\nCouncil, with the several segments of the<br />\ncommunity, should establish a standing<br />\ncommittee to ensure that all departmental<br />\nand<br />\nwell-developed<br />\nprograms are<br />\ncoordinated.<br />\n(2) Formation of a University Senate and<br />\ndepartmental student-faculty committes<br />\nshould be (re)considered.<br />\n(3) Teaching input should be weighted into<br />\npromotional decisions. A course guide-improved along AAUP guidelines (Dec. 69)-could be a partial answer. A credit bank<br />\nsystem would also help. This system assigns<br />\na certain number of units for a full work<br />\nload, and each professional task is credited<br />\ntoward fulfillment of that load.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY 23, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPOW's: Frishman Torture Claim Debated<br />\nEd's.

HERSH<br />\nWASHINGTON, -- I first<br />\ninterviewed Frishman late in 1970,<br />\nmore than a year after he first began<br />\nspeaking out, in the San Diego office<br />\nof Concern for POWs, Incorporated,<br />\nan affiliate of a national POW wives<br />\norganization that had been set up in<br />\nmid-year.<br />\nAlthough he had been out of North<br />\nVietnam for more than eighteen<br />\nmonths, Frishman looked very<br />\nmuch like a recent returnee. He<br />\nweighed 145 pounds, his weight upon<br />\nrelease. Yet his Navy uniform was<br />\nstill loose-fitting, his shirt collar still<br />\nfar too big; he had made no attempt<br />\nto alter his old uniforms or purchase<br />\nnew ones.<br />\nI told him there were many<br />\nresponsible persons who did not<br />\nbelieve his account of torture while<br />\nin the POW camps. \"I prefer to keep<br />\noff tortures,\" he said. \"People keep<br />\non talking about brainwashing,<br />\ntortures, and things like that. If<br />\npeople want to call me wrong about<br />\nthe torture, that's okay. I don't care<br />\nif you write about it.\"<br />\nWhat about the other prisoners<br />\nwho were unable to report<br />\nsystematic physical abuses?<br />\n\"The men released prior to my<br />\ntime had only been up there for a<br />\nshort period of time,\" Frishman<br />\nsaid. \"Their treatment, as they said,<br />\nwas not all that bad. I had much<br />\nmore knowledge than the other<br />\nprisoners who came out. Now, for<br />\nthe first time, they (pentagon<br />\nofficials) had tangible, concrete<br />\nevidence what things really were<br />\nlike.\"<br />\nI reminded him that he had said at<br />\nhis September, 1969, news<br />\nconference that fingernails were<br />\npulled out of Commander Stratton,<br />\nyet later photographs published by<br />\nthe North Vietnamese of Stratton<br />\nshowed no evidence of such<br />\ntreatment.<br />\n\"I never said fingernails were<br />\npulled out of Stratton,\" Frishman<br />\nreplied, speaking in staccato<br />\nfashion. \"I never said he lost<br />\n<br />\nfingernails. In fact, he was hit in the<br />\nhand and lost...\" His voice trailed<br />\noff. \"The press said they were<br />\npulled out, I never did.\"<br />\nOn other specific points he was<br />\nequally vague and contradictory. \"I<br />\ncan tell you this. the former pilot<br />\nsaid, \"I can get you bigger stories<br />\nif I could get clearance. I try to keep<br />\nthings in generalities to avoid any<br />\nchance of retaliation.\" Yet he had<br />\nbeen specific about Commander<br />\nStratton and the wounded prisoner<br />\nwho lived above him.<br />\n\"I was the one who wanted to do<br />\nthis (hold the press conference,),\"<br />\nFrishman added. \"This has been all<br />\nmy decision.

One Colonel closely<br />\ninvolved with POW affairs, bristling<br />\nat my suggestion that the debriefing<br />\nsessions had been utilized to induce<br />\nFrishman to publicly confess, said<br />\nflatly: \"Frishman did report<br />\ninstances of torture that he<br />\nexperienced or heard of.\"<br />\nThe officer also acknowledged,<br />\nNixon<br />\nthe<br />\nthat<br />\nhowever,<br />\nAdministration had made what he<br />\ntermed \"a conscious decision to<br />\npublicize to the world what Hanoi's<br />\n(POW) policy is\" before the Navy<br />\nlieutenant and his colleagues were<br />\nreleased.<br />\nFrishman's information, which<br />\n<br />\n'As a prisoner, I was scared, boy, I was.<br />\nScared of Communism.<br />\nThey can't live with a society like ours.'<br />\nsides of the story. I'm convinced that<br />\nCommunism is a real threat to<br />\nAmerica. It does scare me, it really<br />\ndoes.<br />\n\"As a prisoner, I was scared, boy,<br />\nI was. Scared of Ccrmmunism. They<br />\ncan't live with a society like ours.<br />\nover<br />\nThey have to throw<br />\nCapitalism.\"<br />\nOne man still in the government<br />\nacknowledged some of his own<br />\ncurrent doubts about the Frishman<br />\naccount of life inside North Vietnam<br />\nprisons, adding that the pilot \"was<br />\nunder strain when he was released.<br />\nHe had been interviewed (by the<br />\nforeign press) many, many times.<br />\nHe played ball (with the North<br />\nVietnamese) the most and therefore<br />\nwas the most torn..\" But this official<br />\nhad kept his doubts to himself.<br />\nTold about Frishman's revised<br />\naccount of the fingernail removal<br />\nincident involving Commander<br />\nStratton, another official said: \"I<br />\nwas less prone to believe that than<br />\nanything else.\" A moment later, he<br />\nacknowledged that Frishman had<br />\n\"lost sight of what actually<br />\nhappened.\"<br />\n<br />\nwas immediately accepted at face<br />\nvalue throughout the country, put to<br />\nan end a debate between the<br />\nPentagon and State Department\u2022<br />\nover the precise nature of prisoner<br />\ntreatment inside North Vietnam that<br />\nhad become increasingly harsh.<br />\nFrom the early days of the Air<br />\nWar, the North Vietnamese had<br />\nclaimed that American planes were<br />\nindiscriminately bombing schools,<br />\nhospitals; churches, and other<br />\ncivilian targets. As such, the<br />\ngovernment argued that the<br />\ncaptured pilots were war criminals<br />\nfor whom the provisions of the 1949<br />\nGeneva Convention on prisoners of<br />\nwar -- such as international<br />\ninspection of prisoners camps -- did<br />\nnot apply.<br />\nHanoi's legal basis for its position<br />\nwas centered around its refusal to<br />\napply Article 85 of the Geneva<br />\nConvention which grants prisoners<br />\nof war the full benefit of the Treaty's<br />\nprotection, even if they are tried or<br />\nconvicted of war crimes. North<br />\nVietnam, along with many other<br />\ncommunist and socialist states,<br />\nentered a specific reservation to the<br />\n<br />\narticle before signing.<br />\nThe prisoners were of great<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nconcern<br />\nJohnson<br />\nAdministration. By 1966, a special<br />\nprisoner of war advisory committee<br />\nheaded by Averell Harriman had<br />\nbeen set up and was meeting twice a<br />\nmonth.<br />\nOne of Harriman's first actions, as<br />\nhe recalled in a later interview,<br />\n\"was to find out how we were<br />\ntreating prisoners from the North<br />\ncaptured in the South. I found out we<br />\nwere turning them over to the South<br />\nVietnamese, who were putting them<br />\ninto common jails along with South<br />\nVietnamese criminals.\"<br />\nWhen some direct evidence of<br />\nof<br />\nmistreatment<br />\nseeming<br />\nAmericans in the North -- usually via<br />\nfilmed propaganda interviews with<br />\nthe pilots or photos showing downed<br />\npilots being paraded through Hanoi - became available, Harriman<br />\nrepeatedly overruled Pentagon<br />\nattempts to publicly disseminate the<br />\nmaterial in the United States. He<br />\nexplained later that he had not<br />\nwanted to poison the atmosphere<br />\nand make it more difficult for Hanoi<br />\nto release more prisoners and<br />\nfurther information about the pilots.<br />\n\"We did not advertise the cruelty<br />\nwe knew existed there because we<br />\ndidn't want to make propaganda. It<br />\nwas a conscious decision not to go<br />\npublic,\" the former ambassador<br />\nsaid. \"We didn't use it to stir up the<br />\nAmerican people.\"<br />\nThe Administration's policy about<br />\nnot making progaganda out of the<br />\nprisoner issue seemed to bear fruit<br />\nin February, 1968, and again in early<br />\nAugust, 1968, when three American<br />\npilots were released each time from<br />\nNorth Vietnam to antiwar groups.<br />\nThe decision to publicize<br />\nFrishman's accounts of prison life<br />\nchanged all that, and embarked the<br />\nUnited States on a new policy<br />\ninvolving a high degree of public<br />\nrelations. Now, more than a year<br />\nlater, Administration officials point<br />\nwith pride to the increasing<br />\ncommunication from prisoners<br />\ninside North Vietnam as evidence of<br />\nthe success of the new approach.<br />\nYet the fact remains that no more<br />\nprisoners have been released by the<br />\nNorth since Frishman.<br />\n<br />\nfeiffer<br />\nTHE GOAY THEY TAT<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n0Agic.<br />\n\\\\\\<br />\n<br />\n1\"HE(1 T6PROR11<br />\n<br />\nTHE 10AY WE -TREAT<br />\nPO,LO is-<br />\n<br />\nSf<br />\n<br />\nA at,LOOS<br />\n1)194.6NRD<br />\n<br />\n$10g.<br />\n\\.,<br />\n<br />\niiitiUtitAg<br />\nWI.<br />\n\\-<br />\n<br />\nk)EGOT(Are<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n(D6CtiTFUk<br />\n<br />\nIN 600P<br />\n<br />\nONFRUITFOli,<br />\nAND OF R5<br />\n<br />\nFAIR<br />\n<br />\nt\\160,<br />\n(7711,M<br />\n<br />\n069iEz6<br />\ni4oiiK\"r5N<br />\n1146 WAf&<br />\nMP FRO _<br />\n<br />\nTHe<br />\ntioi1446!<br />\n<br />\nNOW,714/C (5 )Mr I CALL- A kfAUR<br />\nSOCCeSSECR.

Am I a good administrator? Do you have<br />\nconfidence in me? Do I know the tradition and goals of this<br />\nUniversity? If the answers to these questions are largely yes, then<br />\nyou don't have to worry about numbers. If not, then I should not<br />\nbe, and do not wish to remain, a dean of this University.<br /><br />\nCan you picture the scene: a middle-aged man leaning<br />\ntowards the lecture table in Remsen 1, eyes strained at<br />\nthe waves of chairs arching upwards, voice cracked just<br />\nenough to feign spontaneity? Yes, the George Benton<br />\nShow last Friday was a great soap opera. The faculty<br />\napplauded loud, several professors stood up, even a few<br />\ncried, \"We believe you.\"<br />\nBenton (color him Lancelot) now portrays himself as<br />\nthe unsong hero who led his professors against a fat,<br />\nfire-breathing Central Administration. Last November<br />\nthe dean brandished his sword at Homewood House by<br />\ndeclaring a ten per cent faculty reduction well-knowing<br />\nthat the faculty would demand similar cuts in the<br />\nCentral Administration. The crusade had begun, and<br />\nfour months later Gordon's Administration was<br />\ntrimmed the designated amount.<br />\nBut where does this now leave Dr. Benton? With very<br />\nunimpressive figures despite his maudlin rhetoric..<br />\nHomewood's budget has been cut 6.5 per cent--all in<br />\nAdministration--without even a look at the departments.<br />\nAnd it was the dean's timidness at investigating the<br />\nfaculty's own fiefdoms (that,as Biology currently shows,<br />\nalso contain a lot of wasted potential) which was<br />\nactually applauded on Friday.<br />\nBenton's adament refusal to disclose the expenditure<br />\nbreakdowns by department forbids everybody except<br />\nthe dean and maybe the Academic Council from<br />\nstudying whether Hopkins is pouring its money into the<br />\nright barrels. The University last year paid $3.8 million<br />\nout of its general funds to Homewood's science<br />\ndepartments and $2.9 million to the liberal arts even<br />\nthough the 4,000 full-time student population is divided<br />\nequally between the two areas. Within the next two<br />\nyears 23 full-time professors that were formerly<br />\nfinanced by foundation grants will have to be paid by the<br />\nUniversity, costing $500,000 extra annually. Have such<br />\nmatters been considered during the budget talks or<br />\ndiscarded by the push of immediate problems? Benton<br />\nhas indicated that he has not studied these questions<br />\nwhich is an indicator of Benton's success during his first<br />\n230 days.<br /><br />\n...And Talent<br />\nSo far during his reign, the dean has evinced a<br />\npropensity to criticize, yet a lack of creativity to<br />\napproach problems (outside budget hassles) in a fresh<br />\nmanner. His response to undergraduate education is to<br />\ncut enrollment and (again donning his mock-heroic<br />\nmask) \"personally persuade\" his faculty-friends to<br />\nteach more. When asked for more details to this rather<br />\nsimpleminded scheme, Benton replies like a recording:<br />\n\"This is a sensitive area ... this is a soft spot. . . one has<br />\nto proceed slowly.\" Such statements bring back<br />\nmemories of Kimball's do-nothing days. And since<br />\nBenton took over in July, his only educational<br />\ninnovations have been killing the Russian Program and<br />\nEducation Department, a mighty accomplishment!<br />\nDespite months of budget and parliamentary<br />\nmaneuvers, many critical questions have yet to be<br />\nexplored by the dean. Will Hopkins continue research at<br />\nthe expense of teaching? Will Homewood stay a mixedbag liberal arts school or become specialized in certain<br />\npursuits? Will classes be permitted to enlarge even<br />\nthough the student-faculty ratio has declined? George<br />\nBenton must address these and other problems<br />\nimmediately...and hopefully .without his purple prose.<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\nSlow Death<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nthe<br />\nThursday<br />\nLast<br />\nTemporary Advisory Council<br />\nalmost went out of existence;<br />\na death that would have been<br />\nnoticed by few people other<br />\nthan the members. But it did<br />\nnot die. \"What if some crisis<br />\narose?\" We must have our<br />\npaper tiger to eat our paper<br />\ncrises.<br />\nIt is very typical of the<br />\nHomewood scene, that a<br />\ngroup which was never very<br />\neffective should seek to<br />\nmaintain some form of paper<br />\ncontinuity after three months<br />\nof inaction since the<br />\ngovernance proposals were<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\ndown<br />\nvoted<br />\ntime<br />\nthat<br />\nDuring<br />\nreferendum.<br />\nthe University was not<br />\ninactive.<br />\nThe faculty and graduate<br />\nstudents must realize that<br />\nthey are members of a<br />\nuniversity and not just a<br />\ndepartment or research<br />\ngroup.

It we do not do<br />\nour fair share to create the<br />\natmosphere of a community<br />\nof scholars, then we should<br />\nnot complain when things get<br />\ntense.<br />\nThe undergraduates must<br />\nrealize that the \"other side\"<br />\nhas a new captain.

A close<br />\ninspection reveals a great inattention to<br />\ndetails and facts, and consequently casts a<br />\nshadow over the recommendations. A few<br />\nexamples will best indicate why the report<br />\nshould undergo major revision.<br />\n(1) The majority of the committee would<br />\ndemand that one-third of the faculty teach a<br />\nseminar each term, but they possess no<br />\nevidence that seminars are better than large<br />\nclasses. Indeed, our hearings indicated that<br />\nseminars are best only for certain types of<br />\ncourse work at certain times in the student's<br />\ncareer. Furthermore, since the majority<br />\nmade no effort to study how a professor<br />\ndistributes his time, they can not tell us what<br />\nthe ramifications of such a demand might<br />\nbe.<br />\n(2) The committee made no effort to get an<br />\noverview ofteaching in the past several years.<br />\nThus they cannot suggest any trends in<br />\nundergraduate instruction. Second, their<br />\nsource of information for undergrad<br />\nofferings was the \"Schedule of Courses\" sent<br />\nout by the Registrar. There was no attempt<br />\nmade to correct the inadequacies of this<br />\npamphlet.<br />\n(3) Finally, I regret the committee did not<br />\ninvestigate the source of a professor's<br />\nsalary. As a consequence, the committee<br />\ndoes not know if those professors who have<br />\nnot taught recently were shared with other<br />\ndivisions, or were on leave, etc. As<br />\nmentioned before, they haven't even<br />\nresearched whether those \"negligent\"<br />\nprofessors were negligent last year....<br />\nThere is evidence that instruction at<br />\nHopkins is heavily overshadowed by a<br />\nSteve Ross is a junior in natural sciences.<br /><br />\ncombination of research and graduate<br />\nsupervision. Biology,for instance, has 22 fulltime professors averaging 0.8 courses per<br />\nterm<br />\nIndependent work in Biology has two<br />\nshortcoming. It is directed toward the<br />\nprofessors' research objectives; and there<br />\nisn't the manpower to serve all qualified<br />\nBiology<br />\nstudents. Might not the<br />\ntheir<br />\nof<br />\nuse<br />\ndepartment make better<br />\nresources if they offered, say, a Zoology<br />\ncourse to complement Development Biology,<br />\nMarine Biology, etc.? After all, Hopkins is<br />\nrated 8th in the nation in Zoology graduate<br />\nstudies.<br />\nThe above is not to say that the Biology<br />\nprogram is not good, what I believe is that<br />\nthere isn't enough of it. Current financing<br />\nmust demand that Biology and other<br />\ndepartments put out more, while asking less.<br />\nTo assist them in their housekeeping I<br />\npropose:<br />\n(1) Hopkins should formulate a set of bylaws that would delineate power and<br />\nresponsibilities. Additionally, the Academic<br />\nCouncil, with the several segments of the<br />\ncommunity, should establish a standing<br />\ncommittee to ensure that all departmental<br />\nand<br />\nwell-developed<br />\nprograms are<br />\ncoordinated.<br />\n(2) Formation of a University Senate and<br />\ndepartmental student-faculty committes<br />\nshould be (re)considered.<br />\n(3) Teaching input should be weighted into<br />\npromotional decisions. A course guide-improved along AAUP guidelines (Dec. 69)-could be a partial answer. A credit bank<br />\nsystem would also help. This system assigns<br />\na certain number of units for a full work<br />\nload, and each professional task is credited<br />\ntoward fulfillment of that load.<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY 23, 1971<br /><br />\nPOW's: Frishman Torture Claim Debated<br />\nEd's.

As such, the<br />\ngovernment argued that the<br />\ncaptured pilots were war criminals<br />\nfor whom the provisions of the 1949<br />\nGeneva Convention on prisoners of<br />\nwar -- such as international<br />\ninspection of prisoners camps -- did<br />\nnot apply.<br />\nHanoi's legal basis for its position<br />\nwas centered around its refusal to<br />\napply Article 85 of the Geneva<br />\nConvention which grants prisoners<br />\nof war the full benefit of the Treaty's<br />\nprotection, even if they are tried or<br />\nconvicted of war crimes. North<br />\nVietnam, along with many other<br />\ncommunist and socialist states,<br />\nentered a specific reservation to the<br /><br />\narticle before signing.<br />\nThe prisoners were of great<br />\nto<br />\nthe<br />\nconcern<br />\nJohnson<br />\nAdministration. By 1966, a special<br />\nprisoner of war advisory committee<br />\nheaded by Averell Harriman had<br />\nbeen set up and was meeting twice a<br />\nmonth.<br />\nOne of Harriman's first actions, as<br />\nhe recalled in a later interview,<br />\n\"was to find out how we were<br />\ntreating prisoners from the North<br />\ncaptured in the South. I found out we<br />\nwere turning them over to the South<br />\nVietnamese, who were putting them<br />\ninto common jails along with South<br />\nVietnamese criminals.\"<br />\nWhen some direct evidence of<br />\nof<br />\nmistreatment<br />\nseeming<br />\nAmericans in the North -- usually via<br />\nfilmed propaganda interviews with<br />\nthe pilots or photos showing downed<br />\npilots being paraded through Hanoi - became available, Harriman<br />\nrepeatedly overruled Pentagon<br />\nattempts to publicly disseminate the<br />\nmaterial in the United States. He<br />\nexplained later that he had not<br />\nwanted to poison the atmosphere<br />\nand make it more difficult for Hanoi<br />\nto release more prisoners and<br />\nfurther information about the pilots.<br />\n\"We did not advertise the cruelty<br />\nwe knew existed there because we<br />\ndidn't want to make propaganda. It<br />\nwas a conscious decision not to go<br />\npublic,\" the former ambassador<br />\nsaid. \"We didn't use it to stir up the<br />\nAmerican people.\"<br />\nThe Administration's policy about<br />\nnot making progaganda out of the<br />\nprisoner issue seemed to bear fruit<br />\nin February, 1968, and again in early<br />\nAugust, 1968, when three American<br />\npilots were released each time from<br />\nNorth Vietnam to antiwar groups.<br />\nThe decision to publicize<br />\nFrishman's accounts of prison life<br />\nchanged all that, and embarked the<br />\nUnited States on a new policy<br />\ninvolving a high degree of public<br />\nrelations. Now, more than a year<br />\nlater, Administration officials point<br />\nwith pride to the increasing<br />\ncommunication from prisoners<br />\ninside North Vietnam as evidence of<br />\nthe success of the new approach.<br />\nYet the fact remains that no more<br />\nprisoners have been released by the<br />\nNorth since Frishman.<br /><br />\nfeiffer<br />\nTHE GOAY THEY TAT<br />\n-<br /><br />\n0Agic.<br />\n\\\\\\<br /><br />\n1\"HE(1 T6PROR11<br /><br />\nTHE 10AY WE -TREAT<br />\nPO,LO is-<br /><br />\nSf<br /><br />\nA at,LOOS<br />\n1)194.6NRD<br /><br />\n$10g.<br />\n\\.,<br /><br />\niiitiUtitAg<br />\nWI.<br />\n\\-<br /><br />\nk)EGOT(Are<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n(D6CtiTFUk<br /><br />\nIN 600P<br /><br />\nONFRUITFOli,<br />\nAND OF R5<br /><br />\nFAIR<br /><br />\nt\\160,<br />\n(7711,M<br /><br />\n069iEz6<br />\ni4oiiK\"r5N<br />\n1146 WAf&amp;<br />\nMP FRO _<br /><br />\nTHe<br />\ntioi1446!<br /><br />\nNOW,714/C (5 )Mr I CALL- A kfAUR<br />\nSOCCeSSECR.
