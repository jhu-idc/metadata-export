In Dr.<br />\nYoung's opinion, society in<br />\ngeneral has finally come to the<br />\nrealization that proper health<br />\ntreatment is a basic right of man<br />\nand the health field has already<br />\nbecome the \u2014 third largest<br />\nindustry\".<br />\nThere is a great manpower<br />\nshortage in the allied health<br />\nservies. Hopkins already has<br />\nprograms whereby people, many<br />\nof whom come from the inner<br />\ncity, are trained to be technicians<br />\nand nurses aids. Many of these<br />\ntrainees have only a high school<br />\ndiploma and only some are given<br />\ncertificates although all are given<br />\njobs.<br />\nOf course Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, School of Nursing, and<br />\nSchool of Public Health train<br />\nmany people to go into the field<br />\n<br />\nof health mostly only on an<br />\nadvanced level. Dr. Young<br />\nemphasizes that his report is only<br />\nseminal and will suggest possible<br />\nroles that Hopkins could assume<br />\nin training people for jobs other<br />\nthan those of doctors and nurses<br />\nin the field of health. In the<br />\nprocess of making his report, Dr.<br />\nYoung will take suggestions from<br />\nstaff at the Hospital, School of<br />\nPublic Health, and other people<br />\nfamiliar with health problems.<br />\nDr. Young wants to arrive at a<br />\nproposal that will be approved in<br />\nprinciple by the Academic<br />\nCouncil at Homewood, The<br />\nMedical Advisory Board, and The<br />\nSchool of Hygiene Advisory<br />\nBoard. If a general program is<br />\nagreed upon\u2014if indeed Hopkins<br />\ndecides that one should be<br />\ninitiated by the University\u2014then<br />\nthe enormous work of<br />\nestablishing the program in detail<br />\ncan be started.<br />\nThere are already colleges in<br />\nthe Baltimore area training lab<br />\ntechnicians, X-ray technicians,<br />\nand nurses aids and perhaps they<br />\nwill be able to meet the demand.<br />\nIn any case, cooperation between<br />\nmany people in the Baltimore<br />\nCommunity will be needed if a<br />\nplan is to be successful.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, DOW<br />\n<br />\nThe Teach-in revealed an 00<br />\npicture of myself in their social<br />\ntrap; my subsequent feeling \u00b0f<br />\nguilt has, by impulse, driven ine<br />\nto write this letter to all others in<br />\nsituations like mine.

The Commission is very<br />\nconcerned with these issues and<br />\nwe are attempting to develop<br />\nviable solutions in our regular<br />\nmeetings. Certainly the answers<br />\nare not simple and it is quite<br />\nhelpful to receive the thoughts<br />\nand opinions of other concerned<br />\nindividuals, such as Mr. Katz.<br />\nMr. Katz presents the need for<br />\nthe Commission to become more<br />\n\"The Student's Honor<br />\nCommission,\" and suggests the<br />\nidea that a student should have<br />\nthe option to submit his case to<br />\nthe professor involved or to the<br />\nHonor Commission. This specific<br />\nidea has real value and is being<br />\nconsidered by the Commission in<br />\ncommittee. At an open meeting in<br />\nthe near future it shall be fully<br />\ndiscussed and the Commission<br />\nhopes that all concerned members<br />\nof the community will<br />\nparticipate. Another problem in<br />\nthe Commission related to the<br />\nidea of being more for \"the<br />\nstudents\" is the selection of<br />\nHonor Commission members.<br />\nCurrently we are examining more<br />\nrepresentative and appropriate<br />\nselection procedures and again we<br />\n<br />\nwould consider invaluable the<br />\nparticipation and contribution of<br />\nthe community.<br />\nMr. Katz also proposes that a<br />\nstudent should be able to report a<br />\n\"course or a professor for<br />\nallowing cheating,\" either through<br />\nnegligence or the structure of the<br />\ncourse. This is an excellent idea,<br />\nthe mechanics for it do exist, and<br />\nit has been done in the past. If a<br />\nstudent feels there has been<br />\ncheating in a course, whether or<br />\nnot he has factual knowledge of a<br />\nspecific incident, he should report<br />\nit to the Commission. In the<br />\nCommission's investigation, then,<br />\nthe problem is discussed with the<br />\nprofessor involved, and even if an<br />\nhonor violation is not discovered,<br />\nthe professor becomes aware of<br />\nthe problematic situation. This<br />\nidea is really only one aspect of a<br />\nvital question now facing the<br />\nCommission. How far should the<br />\nCommission's authority reach in<br />\nattempting to influence and<br />\nfurther the academic environment<br />\nat Hopkins? Is the Commission's<br />\nplace to encourage professors or<br />\nstudents to direct their academic<br />\nexperience towards ideals<br />\nconsistent with an Honor System<br />\nand a free learning atmosphere?<br />\nOr rather is the Commission<br />\nlimited only to handling honor<br />\nviolations when they arise?<br />\nBeyond these questions of general<br />\n<br />\naims, of course, are the practical<br />\nconcerns for their realization.<br />\nThis, then, is what we consider to<br />\nbe the major problem the Honor<br />\nCommission faces and again<br />\nwould encourage discussion<br />\nthroughout the community.<br />\nOur next open meeting shall be<br />\nDecember 8, and I would like to<br />\nextend a personal invitation to<br />\nMr. Katz, the Newsletter, and all<br />\ninterested Hopkins' students,<br />\nfaculty and administration.<br />\nCharles Steinberg<br />\nHonor Commission Chairman<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nIn two recent articles on<br />\nstudent participation in<br />\nUniversity policy making at the<br />\nHomewood campus, the<br />\nNews-Letter reported that the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies had approved the<br />\nestablishment of a student<br />\ninternship program, and that Dr.<br />\nWickwire, Mr. Bilgraves and a<br />\ngraduate student were members<br />\nof this committee.

It still garners a large share of publicity in its position as the<br />\nvanguard of the \"movement.\" Yet, for those of us whose<br />\nfrustrations grew during political 1968, what has it offered in the<br />\nway of an alternative? In what ways has SDS succeeded in<br />\nchallenging what we see to be faults in our society?<br />\nOn Election Day, SDS staged a demonstration in Washington and<br />\nother major cities across the United States. In Washington, they<br />\nsucceeded in getting over a hundred people \"busted.\" We say<br />\n\"succeeded,\" because this clearly was necessary if SDS's objectives<br />\nwere to be realized. Merely having a thousand people \"voting with<br />\ntheir feet\" would have done previous little to point up a choiceless<br />\nelection; so people had to get arrested, Chicago-style.<br />\nIn SDS's interpretation, the arrests show the \"naked force\" upon<br />\nwhich our system is based. And, perhaps, herein lies the limits of<br />\nSDS's capability as an alternative. SDS had no chance of any<br />\nmeasure of success insofar as influencing public opinion unless<br />\nauthorities responded in a way that could be construed as repression.<br />\nSo ... over a hundred people get arrested, a point is made about the<br />\n\"system,\" -- what next?<br />\nAt the risk of bringing down SDS's collective sneer of<br />\n\"counter-revolutionary,\" we really cannot decipher \"what is next\"<br />\nas far as the SDS program of alternatives go. Possibly, as they claim,<br />\nthey have succeeded in waking up or \"radicalizing\" more people.<br />\nHowever, it seems more likely that the Chicago police and the<br />\ncynicism of the major political parties has accomplished that<br />\nwithout much help from SDS.<br />\nWho has SDS succeeded in politicalizing? So far as can be<br />\nobserved, only the middle-class white student who can presently<br />\nafford to be radicalized. SDS has had damn little effect on the black<br />\npeople or the poor people. It can be pathetic sometimes to hear<br />\nHopkins SDS members nostalgically point out how they started<br />\nUJOIN years ago \u2014 UJOIN being an inner city organization aimed at<br />\nhelping the city's black people. Have they then succeeded in<br />\nappealing to the poor whites? Unfortunately, they have been a poor<br />\n\u2022 rival to George Wallace in this area.<br />\nAs far as perceivable change is concerned, it seems that SDS has<br />\nonly succeeded in titillating its own followers. The SDS script reads<br />\nlike a staged play where the tool runs back and forth across the stage<br />\nscreaming \"Confrontation!\" After the confrontation, then what?<br />\nWhat we see is a lot of frenetic activity and rhetoric,(as usually is<br />\nthe case with rhetoric, it falls on deaf ears). SDS has failed to touch<br />\nthe human, it has not helped to provide those in our society who<br />\nneed help with means for bettering their lot, it has failed in its intent<br />\nto educate those who still believe that all is well in America. Instead,<br />\nSDS labors to analyze America with a semi-Marxist technique<br />\ndespite the fact that the institutions they criticize fail to fit into<br />\ntheir given categories. The result is not only irrelevancy, but a failure<br />\nto intelligently convince those whom SDS looks to as potential<br />\nfollowers.<br />\nThe Port Huron statement, issued at the birth of SDS, was a<br />\ndiscerning attempt to begin to develop a convincing and coherent<br />\ncritique of America's problems.

The Symposium is the result of<br />\nsummer hours of letter writing and the Student Council members<br />\ninvolved deserve the appreciation of the Hopkins Community.<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN HALPERIN<br />\n\"Relevance\" is a word we are<br />\nbeginning to hear again and again<br />\nthese days; it seems that all things<br />\nunder the sun must stand or fall<br />\non the basis of how \"relevant\"<br />\nthey are. A recent New Yorker<br />\ncartoon, for example, showed a<br />\nstudent making a citizen's arrest<br />\non a businessman for irrelevance.<br />\nPerhaps the increasing importance<br />\nof Relevance as a measure of<br />\nvalue is a result of this year's<br />\npolitical campaign; all six<br />\ncandidates were to my mind<br />\noverwhelmingly irrelevant, and<br />\nundoubtedly their grey reflections<br />\nhave shrouded the rest of us with<br />\nthe question of what is relevant in<br />\n.1968 and what is not.<br />\nIf Relevance is a'nattional issue,<br />\nit must of course also be one here<br />\nat Hopkins, which is in so many<br />\nways a relevant \"establishment\"<br />\noasis. I find myself in complete<br />\nagreement with the News-Letter,<br />\nfor example, on the subjects of<br />\nR.O.T.C. and university defense<br />\ncontracts. Neither, it seems to me,<br />\nhas any relevance to the proper<br />\nfunctions and goals of a<br />\nself-respecting university. The<br />\nexistence of either one or both<br />\non any campus is, I think,<br />\nevidence that the university is<br />\ndoing nothing whatsoever to help<br />\ndiminish\u2014is, in fact, helping to<br />\nperpetuate--war, the defense<br />\nestablishment, and aggressive and<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nunenlightened foreign policies, all<br />\nof which ought to be among any<br />\nuniversity's major targets for<br />\noblivion.<br />\nI think any university<br />\nadministration which reacts with<br />\nhorror and threats to student<br />\ndemonstrations or the suggestion<br />\nof them is in danger of becoming<br />\nnot only irrelevant but obsolete.<br />\nDr. Gordon has been guilty of<br />\nsome of this, perhaps due to his<br />\neducation in Lyndon Johnson's<br />\nState Department (the epitome of<br />\nIrrelevance); but Dr. Gordon<br />\nseems to have learned, lately, that<br />\nhowever appealing a university<br />\nwithout any students in it might<br />\nseem, it would not indeed be a<br />\nuniversity. In the echelons just<br />\nbelow Dr. Gordon's--that<br />\nmysterious realm wherein several<br />\nhundred deans or so exist\u2014there<br />\nseems to be, more consistently at<br />\nleast, a laudably realistic and<br />\ncompassionate attitude toward<br />\nstudent desires and needs, with<br />\nthe result that the student now<br />\nhas more influence upon his own<br />\nexistence here than ever before.<br />\nOn example of this is the decision<br />\nlast year to establish an Appeals<br />\nBoard for the freshman<br />\ndormitories, which would hear<br />\ncomplaints from domitory<br />\nstudents on disciplinary matters.<br />\nThe Board itself, however, is<br />\nrapidly in danger of becoming<br />\nirrelevant; it has never met.<br />\n<br />\nI also find guilty of Irrelevance<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's Commission on<br />\nViolence, student-faculty<br />\ncoffee-hours, the Ayn Rand<br />\nSociety, Mr. Kravitt's recent<br />\narticle on Joe Cowan, and<br />\nThomas F. McDonough, whoever<br />\nhe is.<br />\nPeople say the Student Council<br />\nis irrelevant, but J am not sure.<br />\nthink it must be less irrelevant<br />\nthan in past years. If it has made<br />\nmistakes this year, at least it<br />\noccasionally reminds us that it<br />\nexists. I find this year's<br />\nOrientation Committee, which<br />\nwill not let us forget that it exists,<br />\nalmost excruciatingly relevant; for<br />\nonce we are seeing a truly creative<br />\napproach being taken with regard<br />\nto the question of the university<br />\nstudent's relationship to<br />\nessentially non-university<br />\nproblems and issues. And I find<br />\ncourses like \"War in the Modern<br />\nWorld\" relevant, courses that have<br />\nsomething to tell us about the<br />\nworld we live in and are not<br />\nsatisfied with asking us to define<br />\n\"culture\".<br />\nI find the News-Letter in<br />\ngeneral, and Mr. Grauer's cartoons<br />\nin particular, relevant, and on rare<br />\noccasions--most often on<br />\nweekends\u2014I even find myself<br />\nrelevant; readers of this article<br />\nand my Friday afternoon<br />\nstudents, however, may well<br />\ndisagree.<br />\n<br />\nTitanic Two Tight Lipped I<br />\n<br />\nBy RICHARD B.CRAMER<br />\nThe Academic Council is the<br />\nmost influential policy making<br />\nbody on the Homewood campus.<br />\nThe Council has two kinds of<br />\nmeetings; the first is a formal<br />\nmeeting at which resolutions or<br />\nmotions are adopted and become<br />\nthe policy of the University. The<br />\nsecond is an informal meeting,<br />\nduring which issues are discussed<br />\nand accord reached so that<br />\nmotions may be passed at the<br />\nnext formal meeting.<br />\nOn Tuesday, November 12, the<br />\nCouncil held an informal meeting,<br />\nto discuss \"the role of students in<br />\nUniversity policy-making.\" In<br />\nwhat amounts to a major<br />\nconcession on the part of the<br />\nadministration, two<br />\nundergraduates were invited to<br />\nattend. These students, Russell<br />\nPassarella (Remember? Inventive,<br />\nforceful RRRRussss?) and<br />\nMichael Amey (another campus<br />\nleader) were to serve as the<br />\nrepresentatives of the student<br />\nbody at the meeting.<br />\nLet us examine the<br />\nphilo-political basis for this type<br />\nof representation. Naturally, the<br />\nAcademic Council could not<br />\nentertain at its meeting, the views<br />\nof the entire student body. The<br />\nmeeting would have become too<br />\nlengthy and too many students in<br />\none place makes administrators<br />\nqueasy anyway. So the Council<br />\nturned to your and our elected<br />\nleaders, the Student Council.<br />\nO.K.?<br />\n<br />\nFine, all a scale model of<br />\nWashington. But now let us cast<br />\nan eye on how this system works<br />\nin fact. Think back over the<br />\nmonths since you came to school.<br />\nWere you consulted as to your<br />\nopinion on the students' role at<br />\nHopkins? Did you know that the<br />\nAcademic Council was to grapple<br />\nwith this question? Did you know<br />\nby whom you were to be<br />\nrepresented and how to make<br />\nyour views known to them?<br />\nAll right, we ask you for a<br />\nsuspension of disbelief, now, and<br />\nsuggest that you were, in fact,<br />\namply represented at that<br />\nmeeting. Suppose that by some<br />\nquirk of mass psychology, Mssrs.<br />\nPassarella and Amey represented<br />\nperfectly the view of the majority<br />\nof Hopkins students, even<br />\nwithout having consulted them.<br />\nWe suspect that you would<br />\nwant to know how your perfectly<br />\nrepresented views were received<br />\nby a group of men which is to<br />\ndraw major policy guidelines on<br />\nthe subject. There are two easy<br />\nways to inform the students.<br />\nFirst, the members of the Council<br />\ncould have asked a reporter from<br />\nthe News-Letter to be present.<br />\nNot only was such a request not<br />\nmade, but the News-Letter was<br />\ntold that any of its staff members<br />\nwould not be granted admission<br />\nto the meeting.<br />\nSecond, our able<br />\nrepresentatives could have taxed<br />\ntheir memories to the extent that<br />\nthe News-Letter might have<br />\nprinted the events of the meeting<br />\n<br />\nto the best of their recollection.<br />\nConsulted early Tuesday evening,<br />\nMr. Amey and a News-Letter<br />\nreporter conducted a conversation<br />\nthus: (Mr. Amey's remarks are<br />\nthose erroneously labelled \"A\")<br />\nQ. Mike, could you tell tne<br />\nwhether or not there were<br />\nany other students at this<br />\nmeeting besides Russ and<br />\nyourself'?<br />\nA. There were two other graduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nQ. What was the purpose of the<br />\nmeeting?<br />\nA. Just to discuss the general role<br />\nof- the student in the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nQ. Was anything decided?<br />\nA. No, it was a very general and<br />\nrelaxed discussion.<br />\nQ. Is anything going to come of<br />\nthis meeting?<br />\nA. It was just a convenient basis<br />\nfor an exchange of ideas, a<br />\ndialogue.<br />\nQ. Did you discuss student<br />\nparticipation in any<br />\nparticular facet of the<br />\nUniversity?<br />\nA. No,we didn't specify any<br />\nparticular part of the<br />\nUniversity, just general<br />\npoints of information.<br />\nQ. What are these general points<br />\nof information?<br />\nA. What position students should<br />\nhave in policy making in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nMr. Amey also did not know<br />\nwhen or if the Acadeniic Council<br />\nwould again discuss this issue.

Due to a disability,<br />\nhe had been laid off work for the<br />\nsununer, and was just hanging<br />\naround until school started agin.<br />\nHe was in the process of sifting<br />\nthe facts from the news media<br />\ntrying to make a decision about<br />\nthe actions of a free society in<br />\nChicago during a political<br />\ngathering; and having just made a<br />\nmental analogy between Chicago<br />\nand Auschwitz, he noted that the<br />\nmail had arrived. Walking out to<br />\nthe mailbox every day had<br />\nbecome a chore, and besides,<br />\nSakowich was anxiously awaiting<br />\nhis membership card in the<br />\nTeamsters. The letter that day<br />\nwas not to be that delightful. It<br />\nwas a letter from his draft board.<br />\nIt was simply a letter for<br />\nreclassification of his draft status.<br />\nIt took about five minutes to fill<br />\nout. Sakowich made the point<br />\nthat he was a full-time student in<br />\nan accredited University. He<br />\nmailed the letter off immediately,<br />\nand went on in his preparations<br />\nfor school.<br />\nHis first hint that some<br />\nmistakes may have been made was<br />\nWhen his father called on a Friday<br />\nafternoon after registration was<br />\ncompleted. His father said\u2014<br />\n\"Hi, son, got a letter from the<br />\n*aft board today. You're 1-A.\"<br />\n\"Oh, I see,\" his son replied.<br />\n(*Nieto*<br />\nObviously a mistake had been<br />\nmade. Not yet pushing the panic<br />\nbutton, Sakowich checked with<br />\nthe Hopkins authorities. Sent to<br />\nhis draft board almost<br />\nimmediately were messages from<br />\nscf_._ 1,a___g)lalon with the proper<br />\n<br />\nforms saying that indeed he was a<br />\nstudent. Sakowich also wrote an<br />\nappeal. At this point he was<br />\nrather confident that the mistake<br />\nwould be rectified. He had<br />\nappealed in three days and was<br />\nallowed thirty.<br />\nThe next day Sakowich again<br />\nreceived a phone call from his<br />\nfather. He said\u2014<br />\n\"Hi son, I got another letter<br />\nfrom the draft board today.<br />\nYou're ordered to take your<br />\npreinduction physical.\"<br />\nThis time his son didn't say<br />\nanything.<br />\nHe had not even been given<br />\nenough time to appeal. So<br />\nSakowich wrote yet another letter<br />\nto his draft board. This time the<br />\nletter was not so polite.<br />\nBecause his draft board was in<br />\nVirginia, and Sakowich thought it<br />\nrather ridiculous to appear in<br />\nperson for a physical. So when he<br />\nreceived no reply from his letters<br />\nto Virginia, he decided to call the<br />\ndraft board.<br />\nSouthern Bell<br />\nHe got in touch with the<br />\nmatron who ran the show down<br />\nthere. He could tell pretty much<br />\nwhat she was like from her voice.<br />\nShe was about 40, with<br />\nfashionable gray hair, wore<br />\nknee-length flower print skirts, a<br />\nring collar bouse with a Villager<br />\nsweater, brown loafers and<br />\nreading 'glasses; she had an<br />\naristocratic southern accent, had<br />\nthe job to begin with because she<br />\nknew the ruling political family,<br />\nand disliked Sakowich because he<br />\nwas causing trouble for her, spoke<br />\nin a Northern accent; and above<br />\nall she realized that a Virginia<br />\nschool wasn't good enough for<br />\nhim. She said by way of<br />\nexplanation\u2014<br />\n\"Whell whee din know jus<br />\n<br />\nwhut yall was doin this summuh.<br />\nYew cooda been bununin aroun<br />\nowah demonstratin iowah<br />\nsomthin.\"<br />\n\"Uh huh.\"<br />\n\"So yall get the deferment, but<br />\nyew owta take thet phizzicul.

He got a<br />\ntransfer and got reassigned to<br />\nFort Holabird.<br />\nOn the morning of the<br />\nphysical, down he went to the<br />\nBaltimore Customs House, and<br />\nwaited for the doors to open. As<br />\nhe waited, a pacifist group handed<br />\nout leaflets that read,\"You Don't<br />\nHave To Go\". He talked to the<br />\ngroup, college students mostly,<br />\nexcept for a Negro matron, and<br />\nduring the conversation a<br />\npoliceman sauntered over and<br />\ntook down the names of everyone<br />\npresent.<br />\nCop Out<br />\n\"You in with this bunch?\", he<br />\nasked Sakowich.<br />\nHis only reply was a smile and<br />\na shake of the head. After the<br />\npoliceman left, the group went on<br />\nto explain that it was constantly<br />\ntailed by the F.B.I. Why? They<br />\ndidn't know.<br />\nThe doors had opened and<br />\nSakowich went into the building.<br />\nHe was slowly classified and then<br />\nboarded the bus for Holabird. As<br />\nthe bus pulled away, one out of<br />\nthe pacifist group raised two of<br />\nhis fingers in a V-sign. A redneck<br />\nsitting next to Sakowich smiled<br />\nand said to him\u2014<br />\n\"How about that crazy<br />\nbunch?\"<br />\nSakowich ignored him.<br />\n<br />\nFort Holabird is not in an<br />\nenjoyable part of town. Dundalk<br />\nlooks as if Wallace would want to<br />\nlive there if he ever became more<br />\naffluent. The barracks are typical<br />\nArmy architecture, looking like<br />\ni something Heinrich Himmler<br />\nmight have dreamed up on an acid<br />\ntrip.<br />\nArresting Experience<br />\nSo it all began for Sakowich.<br />\nBefore the mental part began<br />\neveryone filled out a form<br />\ndescribing their previous arrests.<br />\n'During the test, the Army<br />\nadministrator (with sideburns<br />\nsneaking down his jowls) looked<br />\nover everyone's record. One<br />\nperson was thrown out a petty<br />\nlarceny record that filled the<br />\nsheet. As he left the building,<br />\nSakowich noticed the Army<br />\npencil stuck in his left ear.<br />\nBehind Sakowich sat a fellow<br />\nthat a Chicago policeman would<br />\nhave clubbed without even<br />\nmaking the effort to think. Hair,<br />\nMoustache, Beard, the whole<br />\nschtick. An Army Captain<br />\napproached him and asked\u2014<br />\n\"Haven't you been here<br />\nbefore?\"<br />\n\"Yeah, but I only got half-way<br />\nthrough.\"<br />\n\"How come?\"<br />\n\"Aw, they had to take me to<br />\nthe hospital, you know like I was<br />\non Amphetamines.\"<br />\nAfter a snort of disgust the<br />\nCaptain disappeared. Sekowich<br />\ntalked to the anarchist after the<br />\ntest and found him likeable<br />\nperson.<br />\n<br />\nbending position. Each line had<br />\ntheir backs turned to the other<br />\nAmerica's defenders of<br />\ndemocracy sniggered at the<br />\nthought of it, much like a<br />\nten-year old would.<br />\nNext came the hernia test.<br />\nCoughcough... Coughcough...<br />\nCoughcough...<br />\nSakowich hated that bastard.<br />\nWarm hands and a mysterious<br />\nsmile.<br />\nThen came blood pressure,<br />\nthen urine samples, then reflexes,<br />\nthen blood tests, then height and<br />\nweight, then eyes again, then<br />\nhearing, then talking to a doctor<br />\nwho tried to convince you that<br />\nyou really weren't insane or<br />\ninhuman if you wanted to kill<br />\nsomebody badly enough.<br />\nAssorted Wisdom<br />\nAnd then the snatches of<br />\nconversation\u2014<br />\n\"He always tells me he hates<br />\nthe CO, and that he's going to<br />\npunch him out one of these days.<br />\nWhat an ass.

Then.<br />\n<br />\nThe medical part of the test<br />\nDISMISSED!!!!<br />\nstarted off with a bang. Sakowich<br />\nstripped to his briefs. Check the The ride home through East<br />\nears.

Notes HopkinsExpectsRout<br />\nOf Devils Tomorrow<br />\nClumsy PMC Squad<br />\nLast Friday, in their first home<br />\ngame of the current season, the<br />\nfreshman football team defeated<br />\nan inept and clumsy squad from<br />\nPMC Colleges of Chester, Pa., by<br />\nthe score of 44-15.<br />\nFrom the opening kickoff to<br />\nthe anticlimatic fourth quarter<br />\nthere was not even the slightest<br />\nshread of doubt about the<br />\noutcome. The game began with a<br />\nfumble<br />\nby PMC Captain<br />\nRichie Weaver on the kickoff. Our<br />\nmen thus had the good fortune to<br />\nbegin play with the ball on the<br />\noPponent's 5 yard line. On the<br />\nsecond play from scrimmage,<br />\nSteve Utz scurried into the end<br />\nzone for the first of his 3 ID's.<br />\nThe extra points were missed and<br />\nthe score was 6-0.<br />\nWeaver held on to the next<br />\nkickoff, and ran it back to the 30.<br />\nIn the next three plays PMC was<br />\nonly able to move several yards,<br />\nand so had to punt. Guard Bud<br />\nCleveland, after a great rushing<br />\nexhibition, got his body in front<br />\nof the kick, from whence it<br />\ncaromed to the PMC 11, where<br />\nHopkins took over. On the next<br />\nPlay, Bud Whalen floated the ball<br />\nto Steve Utz for another score.<br />\nOn the screen, Joe Cieslowslci got<br />\nthe extra points to make the score<br />\n14-0.<br />\nOnce again, PMC managed to<br />\nhold on to the kickoff, and after<br />\ngetting the premier first down of<br />\nthe game, and after marching out<br />\nto their own 30, had to kick. The<br />\n<br />\nball's flight was unfettered this<br />\ntime, but it didn't matter since it<br />\nwas straight up into the air. When<br />\nthe ball finally bounced out of<br />\nbounds the kick amounted to<br />\nminus five yards.<br />\nOn the next play, Bud Whalen<br />\nthrew the \"perfect pass\" to Dave<br />\nPickall for the third TD out of<br />\nfour bffensive plays, certainly a<br />\ngreat show of offensive power.<br />\nThere was no more scoring<br />\nuntil the middle of the second<br />\nquarter when PMC recovered\u2022 a<br />\nfumble on the home 29 and<br />\nmarched in to score on a 1 yard<br />\nQB sneak. They kicked for the<br />\nconversion. A Hopkins march was<br />\nthen culminated by a five yard<br />\nscore by Utz, his third TD. A<br />\nWhalen to Pickall 2 pointer<br />\nfinished the scoring for the half<br />\nwith the score 28-7.<br />\nThe second half began where<br />\nthe first half left off, with an 18<br />\nyard touchdown pass from Bud<br />\nWhalen to Dave Pickall, with<br />\nButch Robey adding the two<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe Hopkins scoring finished<br />\nwhen Jeff Turshen pounded over<br />\nfrom the one after a 37 yard set<br />\nup run by Robey. Halfback Rich<br />\nWeaver then showed the speed<br />\nwhich had coach Bob Scott<br />\nworried, on a 70 yard pass play in<br />\nwhich he left the entire Hopkins<br />\nsecondary behind.<br />\nThe last game of the season<br />\nwill take place today against the<br />\nTowson StateVarsity.<br />\n<br />\nNaval<br />\nResearch<br />\nLaboratory<br />\nWASHINGTON, D.C.<br />\nAn Equal Opportunity Employer<br />\n<br />\nThe Navy's Corporate Laboratory\u2014NRL is<br />\nengaged in research embracing practically<br />\nall branches of physical and engineering science and covering the entire range from<br />\nbasic investigation of fundamental problems to applied and developmental research.<br />\nThe Laboratory has a continuing need for<br />\nphysicists, chemists, metallurgists, mathematicians, oceanographers, and engineers<br />\n(electronic, electrical, and mechanical).

Glaser has set up a<br />\ncommittee of five ,faculty<br />\nmembers, five students, and two<br />\nadministrators to study Stanford's<br />\nrelationship with SRI. The<br />\nInstitute is an independent,<br />\nnon-profit organization affiliated<br />\nwith the University.<br />\nGlaser announced his plans for<br />\nthe study at an unusual<br />\nappearance before the student<br />\nlegislatu'r'e.

In Dr.<br />\nYoung's opinion, society in<br />\ngeneral has finally come to the<br />\nrealization that proper health<br />\ntreatment is a basic right of man<br />\nand the health field has already<br />\nbecome the \u2014 third largest<br />\nindustry\".<br />\nThere is a great manpower<br />\nshortage in the allied health<br />\nservies. Hopkins already has<br />\nprograms whereby people, many<br />\nof whom come from the inner<br />\ncity, are trained to be technicians<br />\nand nurses aids. Many of these<br />\ntrainees have only a high school<br />\ndiploma and only some are given<br />\ncertificates although all are given<br />\njobs.<br />\nOf course Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, School of Nursing, and<br />\nSchool of Public Health train<br />\nmany people to go into the field<br /><br />\nof health mostly only on an<br />\nadvanced level. Dr. Young<br />\nemphasizes that his report is only<br />\nseminal and will suggest possible<br />\nroles that Hopkins could assume<br />\nin training people for jobs other<br />\nthan those of doctors and nurses<br />\nin the field of health. In the<br />\nprocess of making his report, Dr.<br />\nYoung will take suggestions from<br />\nstaff at the Hospital, School of<br />\nPublic Health, and other people<br />\nfamiliar with health problems.<br />\nDr. Young wants to arrive at a<br />\nproposal that will be approved in<br />\nprinciple by the Academic<br />\nCouncil at Homewood, The<br />\nMedical Advisory Board, and The<br />\nSchool of Hygiene Advisory<br />\nBoard. If a general program is<br />\nagreed upon\u2014if indeed Hopkins<br />\ndecides that one should be<br />\ninitiated by the University\u2014then<br />\nthe enormous work of<br />\nestablishing the program in detail<br />\ncan be started.<br />\nThere are already colleges in<br />\nthe Baltimore area training lab<br />\ntechnicians, X-ray technicians,<br />\nand nurses aids and perhaps they<br />\nwill be able to meet the demand.<br />\nIn any case, cooperation between<br />\nmany people in the Baltimore<br />\nCommunity will be needed if a<br />\nplan is to be successful.<br /><br />\nHopkins students, DOW<br /><br />\nThe Teach-in revealed an 00<br />\npicture of myself in their social<br />\ntrap; my subsequent feeling \u00b0f<br />\nguilt has, by impulse, driven ine<br />\nto write this letter to all others in<br />\nsituations like mine.

The Commission is very<br />\nconcerned with these issues and<br />\nwe are attempting to develop<br />\nviable solutions in our regular<br />\nmeetings. Certainly the answers<br />\nare not simple and it is quite<br />\nhelpful to receive the thoughts<br />\nand opinions of other concerned<br />\nindividuals, such as Mr. Katz.<br />\nMr. Katz presents the need for<br />\nthe Commission to become more<br />\n\"The Student's Honor<br />\nCommission,\" and suggests the<br />\nidea that a student should have<br />\nthe option to submit his case to<br />\nthe professor involved or to the<br />\nHonor Commission. This specific<br />\nidea has real value and is being<br />\nconsidered by the Commission in<br />\ncommittee. At an open meeting in<br />\nthe near future it shall be fully<br />\ndiscussed and the Commission<br />\nhopes that all concerned members<br />\nof the community will<br />\nparticipate. Another problem in<br />\nthe Commission related to the<br />\nidea of being more for \"the<br />\nstudents\" is the selection of<br />\nHonor Commission members.<br />\nCurrently we are examining more<br />\nrepresentative and appropriate<br />\nselection procedures and again we<br /><br />\nwould consider invaluable the<br />\nparticipation and contribution of<br />\nthe community.<br />\nMr. Katz also proposes that a<br />\nstudent should be able to report a<br />\n\"course or a professor for<br />\nallowing cheating,\" either through<br />\nnegligence or the structure of the<br />\ncourse. This is an excellent idea,<br />\nthe mechanics for it do exist, and<br />\nit has been done in the past. If a<br />\nstudent feels there has been<br />\ncheating in a course, whether or<br />\nnot he has factual knowledge of a<br />\nspecific incident, he should report<br />\nit to the Commission. In the<br />\nCommission's investigation, then,<br />\nthe problem is discussed with the<br />\nprofessor involved, and even if an<br />\nhonor violation is not discovered,<br />\nthe professor becomes aware of<br />\nthe problematic situation. This<br />\nidea is really only one aspect of a<br />\nvital question now facing the<br />\nCommission. How far should the<br />\nCommission's authority reach in<br />\nattempting to influence and<br />\nfurther the academic environment<br />\nat Hopkins? Is the Commission's<br />\nplace to encourage professors or<br />\nstudents to direct their academic<br />\nexperience towards ideals<br />\nconsistent with an Honor System<br />\nand a free learning atmosphere?<br />\nOr rather is the Commission<br />\nlimited only to handling honor<br />\nviolations when they arise?<br />\nBeyond these questions of general<br /><br />\naims, of course, are the practical<br />\nconcerns for their realization.<br />\nThis, then, is what we consider to<br />\nbe the major problem the Honor<br />\nCommission faces and again<br />\nwould encourage discussion<br />\nthroughout the community.<br />\nOur next open meeting shall be<br />\nDecember 8, and I would like to<br />\nextend a personal invitation to<br />\nMr. Katz, the Newsletter, and all<br />\ninterested Hopkins' students,<br />\nfaculty and administration.<br />\nCharles Steinberg<br />\nHonor Commission Chairman<br />\nCORRECTION<br />\nIn two recent articles on<br />\nstudent participation in<br />\nUniversity policy making at the<br />\nHomewood campus, the<br />\nNews-Letter reported that the<br />\nCommittee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies had approved the<br />\nestablishment of a student<br />\ninternship program, and that Dr.<br />\nWickwire, Mr. Bilgraves and a<br />\ngraduate student were members<br />\nof this committee.

It still garners a large share of publicity in its position as the<br />\nvanguard of the \"movement.\" Yet, for those of us whose<br />\nfrustrations grew during political 1968, what has it offered in the<br />\nway of an alternative? In what ways has SDS succeeded in<br />\nchallenging what we see to be faults in our society?<br />\nOn Election Day, SDS staged a demonstration in Washington and<br />\nother major cities across the United States. In Washington, they<br />\nsucceeded in getting over a hundred people \"busted.\" We say<br />\n\"succeeded,\" because this clearly was necessary if SDS's objectives<br />\nwere to be realized. Merely having a thousand people \"voting with<br />\ntheir feet\" would have done previous little to point up a choiceless<br />\nelection; so people had to get arrested, Chicago-style.<br />\nIn SDS's interpretation, the arrests show the \"naked force\" upon<br />\nwhich our system is based. And, perhaps, herein lies the limits of<br />\nSDS's capability as an alternative. SDS had no chance of any<br />\nmeasure of success insofar as influencing public opinion unless<br />\nauthorities responded in a way that could be construed as repression.<br />\nSo ... over a hundred people get arrested, a point is made about the<br />\n\"system,\" -- what next?<br />\nAt the risk of bringing down SDS's collective sneer of<br />\n\"counter-revolutionary,\" we really cannot decipher \"what is next\"<br />\nas far as the SDS program of alternatives go. Possibly, as they claim,<br />\nthey have succeeded in waking up or \"radicalizing\" more people.<br />\nHowever, it seems more likely that the Chicago police and the<br />\ncynicism of the major political parties has accomplished that<br />\nwithout much help from SDS.<br />\nWho has SDS succeeded in politicalizing? So far as can be<br />\nobserved, only the middle-class white student who can presently<br />\nafford to be radicalized. SDS has had damn little effect on the black<br />\npeople or the poor people. It can be pathetic sometimes to hear<br />\nHopkins SDS members nostalgically point out how they started<br />\nUJOIN years ago \u2014 UJOIN being an inner city organization aimed at<br />\nhelping the city's black people. Have they then succeeded in<br />\nappealing to the poor whites? Unfortunately, they have been a poor<br />\n\u2022 rival to George Wallace in this area.<br />\nAs far as perceivable change is concerned, it seems that SDS has<br />\nonly succeeded in titillating its own followers. The SDS script reads<br />\nlike a staged play where the tool runs back and forth across the stage<br />\nscreaming \"Confrontation!\" After the confrontation, then what?<br />\nWhat we see is a lot of frenetic activity and rhetoric,(as usually is<br />\nthe case with rhetoric, it falls on deaf ears). SDS has failed to touch<br />\nthe human, it has not helped to provide those in our society who<br />\nneed help with means for bettering their lot, it has failed in its intent<br />\nto educate those who still believe that all is well in America. Instead,<br />\nSDS labors to analyze America with a semi-Marxist technique<br />\ndespite the fact that the institutions they criticize fail to fit into<br />\ntheir given categories. The result is not only irrelevancy, but a failure<br />\nto intelligently convince those whom SDS looks to as potential<br />\nfollowers.<br />\nThe Port Huron statement, issued at the birth of SDS, was a<br />\ndiscerning attempt to begin to develop a convincing and coherent<br />\ncritique of America's problems. Whether one sympathizes with SDS<br />\nor not, it is obvious that they have failed to follow up on the<br />\nobjectives which that statement outlined, or the tone which it set.<br />\nSDS has failed to provide students, or anybody else, with an<br />\nalternative that could be worked for, or even a goal which could be<br />\nrealistically achieved.<br />\nPerhaps after the fabled \"revolution,\" SDS might have something<br />\nto say; but that revolution is very fabled and perhaps that is where<br />\nthe failings of SDS lie.<br /><br />\nEisenhower S<br /><br />\npOdUlla<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\nWe would like to heartily, congratulate Manuel<br />\nRodriguez-Orellana and the Student Council for their efforts in<br />\nsetting up the Eisenhower Symposium. The list of speakers, briefly<br />\ngiven in this week's issue, is overwhelming.<br />\nIt should also be noted (especially after our long speaker drought)<br />\nDrs.<br />\nthat the work was done entirely by students with the help of<br />\nmany<br />\nGordon and Eisenhower. The Symposium is the result of<br />\nsummer hours of letter writing and the Student Council members<br />\ninvolved deserve the appreciation of the Hopkins Community.<br /><br />\nBy JOHN HALPERIN<br />\n\"Relevance\" is a word we are<br />\nbeginning to hear again and again<br />\nthese days; it seems that all things<br />\nunder the sun must stand or fall<br />\non the basis of how \"relevant\"<br />\nthey are. A recent New Yorker<br />\ncartoon, for example, showed a<br />\nstudent making a citizen's arrest<br />\non a businessman for irrelevance.<br />\nPerhaps the increasing importance<br />\nof Relevance as a measure of<br />\nvalue is a result of this year's<br />\npolitical campaign; all six<br />\ncandidates were to my mind<br />\noverwhelmingly irrelevant, and<br />\nundoubtedly their grey reflections<br />\nhave shrouded the rest of us with<br />\nthe question of what is relevant in<br />\n.1968 and what is not.<br />\nIf Relevance is a'nattional issue,<br />\nit must of course also be one here<br />\nat Hopkins, which is in so many<br />\nways a relevant \"establishment\"<br />\noasis. I find myself in complete<br />\nagreement with the News-Letter,<br />\nfor example, on the subjects of<br />\nR.O.T.C. and university defense<br />\ncontracts. Neither, it seems to me,<br />\nhas any relevance to the proper<br />\nfunctions and goals of a<br />\nself-respecting university. The<br />\nexistence of either one or both<br />\non any campus is, I think,<br />\nevidence that the university is<br />\ndoing nothing whatsoever to help<br />\ndiminish\u2014is, in fact, helping to<br />\nperpetuate--war, the defense<br />\nestablishment, and aggressive and<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nunenlightened foreign policies, all<br />\nof which ought to be among any<br />\nuniversity's major targets for<br />\noblivion.<br />\nI think any university<br />\nadministration which reacts with<br />\nhorror and threats to student<br />\ndemonstrations or the suggestion<br />\nof them is in danger of becoming<br />\nnot only irrelevant but obsolete.<br />\nDr. Gordon has been guilty of<br />\nsome of this, perhaps due to his<br />\neducation in Lyndon Johnson's<br />\nState Department (the epitome of<br />\nIrrelevance); but Dr. Gordon<br />\nseems to have learned, lately, that<br />\nhowever appealing a university<br />\nwithout any students in it might<br />\nseem, it would not indeed be a<br />\nuniversity. In the echelons just<br />\nbelow Dr. Gordon's--that<br />\nmysterious realm wherein several<br />\nhundred deans or so exist\u2014there<br />\nseems to be, more consistently at<br />\nleast, a laudably realistic and<br />\ncompassionate attitude toward<br />\nstudent desires and needs, with<br />\nthe result that the student now<br />\nhas more influence upon his own<br />\nexistence here than ever before.<br />\nOn example of this is the decision<br />\nlast year to establish an Appeals<br />\nBoard for the freshman<br />\ndormitories, which would hear<br />\ncomplaints from domitory<br />\nstudents on disciplinary matters.<br />\nThe Board itself, however, is<br />\nrapidly in danger of becoming<br />\nirrelevant; it has never met.<br /><br />\nI also find guilty of Irrelevance<br />\nDr. Eisenhower's Commission on<br />\nViolence, student-faculty<br />\ncoffee-hours, the Ayn Rand<br />\nSociety, Mr. Kravitt's recent<br />\narticle on Joe Cowan, and<br />\nThomas F. McDonough, whoever<br />\nhe is.<br />\nPeople say the Student Council<br />\nis irrelevant, but J am not sure.<br />\nthink it must be less irrelevant<br />\nthan in past years. If it has made<br />\nmistakes this year, at least it<br />\noccasionally reminds us that it<br />\nexists. I find this year's<br />\nOrientation Committee, which<br />\nwill not let us forget that it exists,<br />\nalmost excruciatingly relevant; for<br />\nonce we are seeing a truly creative<br />\napproach being taken with regard<br />\nto the question of the university<br />\nstudent's relationship to<br />\nessentially non-university<br />\nproblems and issues. And I find<br />\ncourses like \"War in the Modern<br />\nWorld\" relevant, courses that have<br />\nsomething to tell us about the<br />\nworld we live in and are not<br />\nsatisfied with asking us to define<br />\n\"culture\".<br />\nI find the News-Letter in<br />\ngeneral, and Mr. Grauer's cartoons<br />\nin particular, relevant, and on rare<br />\noccasions--most often on<br />\nweekends\u2014I even find myself<br />\nrelevant; readers of this article<br />\nand my Friday afternoon<br />\nstudents, however, may well<br />\ndisagree.<br /><br />\nTitanic Two Tight Lipped I<br /><br />\nBy RICHARD B.CRAMER<br />\nThe Academic Council is the<br />\nmost influential policy making<br />\nbody on the Homewood campus.<br />\nThe Council has two kinds of<br />\nmeetings; the first is a formal<br />\nmeeting at which resolutions or<br />\nmotions are adopted and become<br />\nthe policy of the University. The<br />\nsecond is an informal meeting,<br />\nduring which issues are discussed<br />\nand accord reached so that<br />\nmotions may be passed at the<br />\nnext formal meeting.<br />\nOn Tuesday, November 12, the<br />\nCouncil held an informal meeting,<br />\nto discuss \"the role of students in<br />\nUniversity policy-making.\" In<br />\nwhat amounts to a major<br />\nconcession on the part of the<br />\nadministration, two<br />\nundergraduates were invited to<br />\nattend. These students, Russell<br />\nPassarella (Remember? Inventive,<br />\nforceful RRRRussss?) and<br />\nMichael Amey (another campus<br />\nleader) were to serve as the<br />\nrepresentatives of the student<br />\nbody at the meeting.<br />\nLet us examine the<br />\nphilo-political basis for this type<br />\nof representation. Naturally, the<br />\nAcademic Council could not<br />\nentertain at its meeting, the views<br />\nof the entire student body. The<br />\nmeeting would have become too<br />\nlengthy and too many students in<br />\none place makes administrators<br />\nqueasy anyway. So the Council<br />\nturned to your and our elected<br />\nleaders, the Student Council.<br />\nO.K.?<br /><br />\nFine, all a scale model of<br />\nWashington. But now let us cast<br />\nan eye on how this system works<br />\nin fact. Think back over the<br />\nmonths since you came to school.<br />\nWere you consulted as to your<br />\nopinion on the students' role at<br />\nHopkins? Did you know that the<br />\nAcademic Council was to grapple<br />\nwith this question?

There are two easy<br />\nways to inform the students.<br />\nFirst, the members of the Council<br />\ncould have asked a reporter from<br />\nthe News-Letter to be present.<br />\nNot only was such a request not<br />\nmade, but the News-Letter was<br />\ntold that any of its staff members<br />\nwould not be granted admission<br />\nto the meeting.<br />\nSecond, our able<br />\nrepresentatives could have taxed<br />\ntheir memories to the extent that<br />\nthe News-Letter might have<br />\nprinted the events of the meeting<br /><br />\nto the best of their recollection.<br />\nConsulted early Tuesday evening,<br />\nMr. Amey and a News-Letter<br />\nreporter conducted a conversation<br />\nthus: (Mr. Amey's remarks are<br />\nthose erroneously labelled \"A\")<br />\nQ.

Just to discuss the general role<br />\nof- the student in the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nQ. Was anything decided?<br />\nA. No, it was a very general and<br />\nrelaxed discussion.<br />\nQ. Is anything going to come of<br />\nthis meeting?<br />\nA. It was just a convenient basis<br />\nfor an exchange of ideas, a<br />\ndialogue.<br />\nQ.

No,we didn't specify any<br />\nparticular part of the<br />\nUniversity, just general<br />\npoints of information.<br />\nQ. What are these general points<br />\nof information?<br />\nA. What position students should<br />\nhave in policy making in the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nMr. Amey also did not know<br />\nwhen or if the Acadeniic Council<br />\nwould again discuss this issue.

Due to a disability,<br />\nhe had been laid off work for the<br />\nsununer, and was just hanging<br />\naround until school started agin.<br />\nHe was in the process of sifting<br />\nthe facts from the news media<br />\ntrying to make a decision about<br />\nthe actions of a free society in<br />\nChicago during a political<br />\ngathering; and having just made a<br />\nmental analogy between Chicago<br />\nand Auschwitz, he noted that the<br />\nmail had arrived. Walking out to<br />\nthe mailbox every day had<br />\nbecome a chore, and besides,<br />\nSakowich was anxiously awaiting<br />\nhis membership card in the<br />\nTeamsters. The letter that day<br />\nwas not to be that delightful. It<br />\nwas a letter from his draft board.<br />\nIt was simply a letter for<br />\nreclassification of his draft status.<br />\nIt took about five minutes to fill<br />\nout. Sakowich made the point<br />\nthat he was a full-time student in<br />\nan accredited University. He<br />\nmailed the letter off immediately,<br />\nand went on in his preparations<br />\nfor school.<br />\nHis first hint that some<br />\nmistakes may have been made was<br />\nWhen his father called on a Friday<br />\nafternoon after registration was<br />\ncompleted. His father said\u2014<br />\n\"Hi, son, got a letter from the<br />\n*aft board today. You're 1-A.\"<br />\n\"Oh, I see,\" his son replied.<br />\n(*Nieto*<br />\nObviously a mistake had been<br />\nmade. Not yet pushing the panic<br />\nbutton, Sakowich checked with<br />\nthe Hopkins authorities. Sent to<br />\nhis draft board almost<br />\nimmediately were messages from<br />\nscf_._ 1,a___g)lalon with the proper<br /><br />\nforms saying that indeed he was a<br />\nstudent. Sakowich also wrote an<br />\nappeal. At this point he was<br />\nrather confident that the mistake<br />\nwould be rectified. He had<br />\nappealed in three days and was<br />\nallowed thirty.<br />\nThe next day Sakowich again<br />\nreceived a phone call from his<br />\nfather. He said\u2014<br />\n\"Hi son, I got another letter<br />\nfrom the draft board today.<br />\nYou're ordered to take your<br />\npreinduction physical.\"<br />\nThis time his son didn't say<br />\nanything.<br />\nHe had not even been given<br />\nenough time to appeal. So<br />\nSakowich wrote yet another letter<br />\nto his draft board. This time the<br />\nletter was not so polite.<br />\nBecause his draft board was in<br />\nVirginia, and Sakowich thought it<br />\nrather ridiculous to appear in<br />\nperson for a physical. So when he<br />\nreceived no reply from his letters<br />\nto Virginia, he decided to call the<br />\ndraft board.<br />\nSouthern Bell<br />\nHe got in touch with the<br />\nmatron who ran the show down<br />\nthere. He could tell pretty much<br />\nwhat she was like from her voice.<br />\nShe was about 40, with<br />\nfashionable gray hair, wore<br />\nknee-length flower print skirts, a<br />\nring collar bouse with a Villager<br />\nsweater, brown loafers and<br />\nreading 'glasses; she had an<br />\naristocratic southern accent, had<br />\nthe job to begin with because she<br />\nknew the ruling political family,<br />\nand disliked Sakowich because he<br />\nwas causing trouble for her, spoke<br />\nin a Northern accent; and above<br />\nall she realized that a Virginia<br />\nschool wasn't good enough for<br />\nhim. She said by way of<br />\nexplanation\u2014<br />\n\"Whell whee din know jus<br /><br />\nwhut yall was doin this summuh.<br />\nYew cooda been bununin aroun<br />\nowah demonstratin iowah<br />\nsomthin.\"<br />\n\"Uh huh.\"<br />\n\"So yall get the deferment, but<br />\nyew owta take thet phizzicul.

He got a<br />\ntransfer and got reassigned to<br />\nFort Holabird.<br />\nOn the morning of the<br />\nphysical, down he went to the<br />\nBaltimore Customs House, and<br />\nwaited for the doors to open. As<br />\nhe waited, a pacifist group handed<br />\nout leaflets that read,\"You Don't<br />\nHave To Go\". He talked to the<br />\ngroup, college students mostly,<br />\nexcept for a Negro matron, and<br />\nduring the conversation a<br />\npoliceman sauntered over and<br />\ntook down the names of everyone<br />\npresent.<br />\nCop Out<br />\n\"You in with this bunch?\", he<br />\nasked Sakowich.<br />\nHis only reply was a smile and<br />\na shake of the head. After the<br />\npoliceman left, the group went on<br />\nto explain that it was constantly<br />\ntailed by the F.B.I. Why? They<br />\ndidn't know.<br />\nThe doors had opened and<br />\nSakowich went into the building.<br />\nHe was slowly classified and then<br />\nboarded the bus for Holabird. As<br />\nthe bus pulled away, one out of<br />\nthe pacifist group raised two of<br />\nhis fingers in a V-sign. A redneck<br />\nsitting next to Sakowich smiled<br />\nand said to him\u2014<br />\n\"How about that crazy<br />\nbunch?\"<br />\nSakowich ignored him.<br /><br />\nFort Holabird is not in an<br />\nenjoyable part of town. Dundalk<br />\nlooks as if Wallace would want to<br />\nlive there if he ever became more<br />\naffluent. The barracks are typical<br />\nArmy architecture, looking like<br />\ni something Heinrich Himmler<br />\nmight have dreamed up on an acid<br />\ntrip.<br />\nArresting Experience<br />\nSo it all began for Sakowich.<br />\nBefore the mental part began<br />\neveryone filled out a form<br />\ndescribing their previous arrests.<br />\n'During the test, the Army<br />\nadministrator (with sideburns<br />\nsneaking down his jowls) looked<br />\nover everyone's record. One<br />\nperson was thrown out a petty<br />\nlarceny record that filled the<br />\nsheet. As he left the building,<br />\nSakowich noticed the Army<br />\npencil stuck in his left ear.<br />\nBehind Sakowich sat a fellow<br />\nthat a Chicago policeman would<br />\nhave clubbed without even<br />\nmaking the effort to think. Hair,<br />\nMoustache, Beard, the whole<br />\nschtick. An Army Captain<br />\napproached him and asked\u2014<br />\n\"Haven't you been here<br />\nbefore?\"<br />\n\"Yeah, but I only got half-way<br />\nthrough.\"<br />\n\"How come?\"<br />\n\"Aw, they had to take me to<br />\nthe hospital, you know like I was<br />\non Amphetamines.\"<br />\nAfter a snort of disgust the<br />\nCaptain disappeared. Sekowich<br />\ntalked to the anarchist after the<br />\ntest and found him likeable<br />\nperson.<br /><br />\nbending position. Each line had<br />\ntheir backs turned to the other<br />\nAmerica's defenders of<br />\ndemocracy sniggered at the<br />\nthought of it, much like a<br />\nten-year old would.<br />\nNext came the hernia test.<br />\nCoughcough... Coughcough...<br />\nCoughcough...<br />\nSakowich hated that bastard.<br />\nWarm hands and a mysterious<br />\nsmile.<br />\nThen came blood pressure,<br />\nthen urine samples, then reflexes,<br />\nthen blood tests, then height and<br />\nweight, then eyes again, then<br />\nhearing, then talking to a doctor<br />\nwho tried to convince you that<br />\nyou really weren't insane or<br />\ninhuman if you wanted to kill<br />\nsomebody badly enough.<br />\nAssorted Wisdom<br />\nAnd then the snatches of<br />\nconversation\u2014<br />\n\"He always tells me he hates<br />\nthe CO, and that he's going to<br />\npunch him out one of these days.<br />\nWhat an ass.

The<br /><br />\nball's flight was unfettered this<br />\ntime, but it didn't matter since it<br />\nwas straight up into the air.
