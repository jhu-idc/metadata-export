Game on Thursday.<br />\n<br />\nBaroness Bertha von Suttner, of<br />\nVienna, one of the foremost of European women interested in arbitration, will address the Maryland<br />\nPeace Society, on December 5, in<br />\nMcCoy Hall. Baroness von Suttner is president of the peace society of her country, and vice-president of the International Peace<br />\nBureau of Berne.<br />\nThe Baroness is one of the most<br />\nremarkable women of our time.<br />\nShe was born in Prague in 1843,<br />\nthe daughter of Gen. Count Franz<br />\nvon Kinsky, and his wife, who, before her marriage, had been Fraulein Sophie Korner of the Korner<br />\nfamily to which the famous poet<br />\nof that name belonged. In 1876<br />\nshe married Baron Gundaccar von<br />\nSuttner, who died in 1902. She<br />\nspent many years in travel with her<br />\nhusband, and at one time lived for<br />\nnine years in the Caucasus.<br />\nAt the age of thirty-seven the<br />\nBaroness turned to literature, and<br />\nher first book appeared in 1880.<br />\nSince that time she has been an<br />\nassiduous writer, and hardly a year<br />\nhas gone by without bringing forth<br />\nsome new production of her pen.<br />\nIn 1891 'she became interested in<br />\nthe movement for international<br />\npeace, and has ever since been<br />\namong the most prominent workers<br />\nin the peace cause. Many of her<br />\nnovels have been devoted to spreading the peace propaganda, and she<br />\nhas become a well known figure at<br />\npeace congresses, in this country as<br />\nwell as abroad.<br />\nBaroness Suttner's novel \"Die<br />\nWaffen Nieder\" (\"Lay Down Your<br />\nArms\") is her most noted work,<br />\nand the one that established her as<br />\na leader among workers for peace.<br />\nAmong others of her books are:<br />\n\"The Inventory of a Soul,\" \"The<br />\nMaschinenzeitalter,\" \"Schad-I der<br />\nQual ;\" \"Martha's Kinder,\" a sequal<br />\nto \"Lay Down Your Arms;\" \"The<br />\nPeace Conference at the Hague, a<br />\nJournal,\" and \"Briefe an eineh<br />\nToten.\" Her memoirs appeared in<br />\n1909.<br />\n<br />\nIn response to notices posted on<br />\nthe bulletin-boards by J. S. Dickinson, Charles Leland Getz and J.<br />\nEarle Uhler, about fifty non-fraternity men came together last<br />\nMonday at one o'clock to decide<br />\nwhether they would accept the offer of one representative to the Cotillon Board which had been made<br />\nby the Cotillon Board the preceding week. Mr. Dickinson presided.<br />\nImmediately after the meeting was<br />\ncalled to order, Mr. Getz was recognized. After running over the<br />\nhistory of the Student CouncilCotillon Board negotiations, he proceeded to answer the personal<br />\ncharges which had been brought<br />\nagainst him, and finished by saying<br />\nthat it remained for the non-fraternity men then assembled to decide whether they would accept the<br />\nCotillon Board's proposal or present to the President the petition<br />\nwhich had been circulated during<br />\nthe preceding week.<br />\n'Mr. J. Earle Uhler, the next<br />\nspeaker, first defended himself<br />\nagainst the,charges of inconsistency<br />\nwhich had been made against him,<br />\nand then moved that the Cotillon<br />\nBoard's proposal be accepted .for<br />\nharmony's sake.<br />\nMr. Dickinson took the floor to.<br />\nspeak in favor of Mr. Uhler's motion. He felt, he said, that justice<br />\nentitled the non-fraternity men to<br />\nmore than one representative on the<br />\nCotillon Board. He felt, moreover,<br />\nthat the attitude which all through<br />\nthe negotiations had been assumed<br />\nby the members of that Board was<br />\nhigh-handed and unreasonable. It<br />\nwas now in the power of the nonfraternity men, by voting, to reject<br />\nthe Cotillon Board's proposal and<br />\nby resolving to present a petition<br />\nto the President to bring the dances<br />\nto a close altogether; for this, he<br />\nwas informed, would be the result<br />\nof the presentation of a petition.<br />\nBy such a result the non-fraternity<br />\nmen would not be the sufferers.<br />\nThey could now, however, show the<br />\ngenerosity and good feeling which<br />\nthey felt toward the fraternity men.<br />\nHe was sure that none of the nonfraternity men desired to see a split<br />\nbetween fraternity men and nonfraternity men; and even although<br />\nthe Cotillon Board's proposal did<br />\nnot give them the representation<br />\nthey were entitled to, he urged<br />\nthem to be magnanirnous, and for<br />\nthe sake of harmony to accept it.<br />\nAmong others who spoke were<br />\nCochran Supplee, 14; J. E. Richardson, 'i3; R. Gminder, \"3; L. J.<br />\n<br />\nwas<br />\n.\\11-. J. Reaney Wolfe,<br />\nappointed head coach of the lacrosse team for the, season of 1913,<br />\nat a meeting of the Athletic Board,<br />\non Monday, November 18. Mr.<br />\nEdward 0. Hulburt, also of 'ii,<br />\nwas appointed assistant coach.<br />\nIt is fortunate for the team that<br />\nReaney Wolfe has been appointed,<br />\nas his selection is the best that<br />\ncould have been made. \u2022 Wolfe is<br />\na player of long experience and he<br />\nhas played a star game on all teams<br />\nof which he has been a member.<br />\nHis first appearance on a Hopkins<br />\nteam was in 1910, when he played<br />\ncenter on the 'Varsity. In 1911 he<br />\nplayed center on the 'Varsity team<br />\nwhich won the championship of the<br />\nUnited States. Last year Wolfe<br />\nplayed with Mount Washington and<br />\nalternated between center and third<br />\ndefence. Not only has he had this<br />\nexperience in playing, but he has<br />\nalso been instructor in athletics at<br />\nthe Country School and the Jefferson School. Another point in favor<br />\nof the new coach is the fact that<br />\nhe is a midfield man, a department<br />\nin which Hopkins has been relatively weak for several years. The<br />\nmembers of the team are delighted<br />\nwith the appointment, and nothing<br />\nbut approval is heard from those<br />\nacquainted with lacrosse affairs.<br />\nThe assistant coach, Eddie Hulburt, is the logical man to work<br />\nwith Wolfe. Hulburt has played<br />\nclose attack, especially, in home and<br />\nfirst attack for three years with the<br />\n'Varsity, and in 1911, was captain<br />\nof the championship team. Last<br />\nyear Hulburt also played for Mount<br />\nWashington, and was the strongest<br />\nman on their close attack. As he<br />\nis now a student at the University,<br />\nand as Ile has played lacrosse only<br />\nthree seasons, Hulburt is eligible<br />\nthis year and will play one of the<br />\nclose attack positions.<br />\nThe selection of the coach is a<br />\nmost important matter, and Hopkins students have good reason to<br />\nrejoice at the choice of Reaney<br />\nWolfe as the head coach. May he<br />\nlead another team to the intercollegiate championship.<br />\n<br />\nGallaudet succeeded in defeating<br />\nHopkins in football last Saturday<br />\nat Homewood, 16 to 14. The score<br />\nindicates a close game, and the play<br />\nwas fairly even. Hopkins, -however, did not play anything like as<br />\ngood football against the deaf-mutes<br />\nas against St. John's the preceding<br />\nweek. The work of the Hopkins<br />\nteam was disappointing in the extreme to the rooters. Many of the<br />\nplayers appeared to be affected with<br />\na feeling of indifference, and they<br />\n(lid not display the amount of vim<br />\nand spirit that a football team usually has whether it has been winning<br />\nits games or not.<br />\nHopkins ought.to have defeated<br />\nGallaudet, although the Washingtonians were playing good steady<br />\nfootball. As a team, the Hopkins<br />\nplayers did not shake off their listlessness until too late. The visiting team was probably slightly<br />\nheavier than the Black and Blue,<br />\nand man for man,the Kendall Green<br />\nsquad clearly outplayed its opponents.<br />\nThe ball changed hands several<br />\ntimes during the first quarter, but<br />\nneither team was able to score.<br />\nBranham tried a field goal, but his<br />\nkick did not carry the pigskin quite<br />\nto the crossbar, although his aim<br />\nwas true.,<br />\nRandall, of Gallaudet, scored a<br />\ntouchdown in the second period.<br />\nThe mutes carried the ball from the<br />\ncenter of the field to Hopkins' goal<br />\nline by forward passes and end<br />\nruns. Moore kicked goal.<br />\nBranham caught the Gallaudet<br />\nkick-off and carried it to the 25yard line. By line plunging and<br />\nend runs, the pigskin was carried<br />\ninto Gallaudet's territory, only to be<br />\nlost on downs, after some unsticcessful forward passes. Gallaudet<br />\nrecovered some of the lost ground<br />\nand Moore kicked a goal from the<br />\n35-yard line. Hopkins took a momentary brace after the kick-off,<br />\nand crood gains were made by all<br />\nthe Hopkins backs. Bridgeman tallied the first touchdown by slipping<br />\naway to the side of the gridiron<br />\nwithout being noticed and catching<br />\na beautifully thrown pass from Bagley. Branham kicked goal. The<br />\nhalf ended with the score io to 7.<br />\nBagley intercepted a forward pass<br />\nof Gallaudet's, and not only interrupted the mutes' steady progress<br />\ntoward the Hopkins goal line, but<br />\nhe almost scored a touchdown before being tackled. He fumbled<br />\nwhen he was tackled, but Connolly<br />\nrecovered the ball for Hopkins. G.<br />\n<br />\nWomen's Meeting.<br />\n<br />\nOn Tuesday, November 26, at 5<br />\nP.

Davis, '93, the well<br />\nknown authority on football.<br />\nAs long ago as 1878, Woodrow<br />\nWilson took an active interest in<br />\nfootball.

Game on Thursday.<br /><br />\nBaroness Bertha von Suttner, of<br />\nVienna, one of the foremost of European women interested in arbitration, will address the Maryland<br />\nPeace Society, on December 5, in<br />\nMcCoy Hall. Baroness von Suttner is president of the peace society of her country, and vice-president of the International Peace<br />\nBureau of Berne.<br />\nThe Baroness is one of the most<br />\nremarkable women of our time.<br />\nShe was born in Prague in 1843,<br />\nthe daughter of Gen. Count Franz<br />\nvon Kinsky, and his wife, who, before her marriage, had been Fraulein Sophie Korner of the Korner<br />\nfamily to which the famous poet<br />\nof that name belonged. In 1876<br />\nshe married Baron Gundaccar von<br />\nSuttner, who died in 1902. She<br />\nspent many years in travel with her<br />\nhusband, and at one time lived for<br />\nnine years in the Caucasus.<br />\nAt the age of thirty-seven the<br />\nBaroness turned to literature, and<br />\nher first book appeared in 1880.<br />\nSince that time she has been an<br />\nassiduous writer, and hardly a year<br />\nhas gone by without bringing forth<br />\nsome new production of her pen.<br />\nIn 1891 'she became interested in<br />\nthe movement for international<br />\npeace, and has ever since been<br />\namong the most prominent workers<br />\nin the peace cause. Many of her<br />\nnovels have been devoted to spreading the peace propaganda, and she<br />\nhas become a well known figure at<br />\npeace congresses, in this country as<br />\nwell as abroad.<br />\nBaroness Suttner's novel \"Die<br />\nWaffen Nieder\" (\"Lay Down Your<br />\nArms\") is her most noted work,<br />\nand the one that established her as<br />\na leader among workers for peace.<br />\nAmong others of her books are:<br />\n\"The Inventory of a Soul,\" \"The<br />\nMaschinenzeitalter,\" \"Schad-I der<br />\nQual ;\" \"Martha's Kinder,\" a sequal<br />\nto \"Lay Down Your Arms;\" \"The<br />\nPeace Conference at the Hague, a<br />\nJournal,\" and \"Briefe an eineh<br />\nToten.\" Her memoirs appeared in<br />\n1909.<br /><br />\nIn response to notices posted on<br />\nthe bulletin-boards by J. S. Dickinson, Charles Leland Getz and J.<br />\nEarle Uhler, about fifty non-fraternity men came together last<br />\nMonday at one o'clock to decide<br />\nwhether they would accept the offer of one representative to the Cotillon Board which had been made<br />\nby the Cotillon Board the preceding week. Mr. Dickinson presided.<br />\nImmediately after the meeting was<br />\ncalled to order, Mr. Getz was recognized. After running over the<br />\nhistory of the Student CouncilCotillon Board negotiations, he proceeded to answer the personal<br />\ncharges which had been brought<br />\nagainst him, and finished by saying<br />\nthat it remained for the non-fraternity men then assembled to decide whether they would accept the<br />\nCotillon Board's proposal or present to the President the petition<br />\nwhich had been circulated during<br />\nthe preceding week.<br />\n'Mr. J. Earle Uhler, the next<br />\nspeaker, first defended himself<br />\nagainst the,charges of inconsistency<br />\nwhich had been made against him,<br />\nand then moved that the Cotillon<br />\nBoard's proposal be accepted .for<br />\nharmony's sake.<br />\nMr. Dickinson took the floor to.<br />\nspeak in favor of Mr. Uhler's motion. He felt, he said, that justice<br />\nentitled the non-fraternity men to<br />\nmore than one representative on the<br />\nCotillon Board. He felt, moreover,<br />\nthat the attitude which all through<br />\nthe negotiations had been assumed<br />\nby the members of that Board was<br />\nhigh-handed and unreasonable. It<br />\nwas now in the power of the nonfraternity men, by voting, to reject<br />\nthe Cotillon Board's proposal and<br />\nby resolving to present a petition<br />\nto the President to bring the dances<br />\nto a close altogether; for this, he<br />\nwas informed, would be the result<br />\nof the presentation of a petition.<br />\nBy such a result the non-fraternity<br />\nmen would not be the sufferers.<br />\nThey could now, however, show the<br />\ngenerosity and good feeling which<br />\nthey felt toward the fraternity men.<br />\nHe was sure that none of the nonfraternity men desired to see a split<br />\nbetween fraternity men and nonfraternity men; and even although<br />\nthe Cotillon Board's proposal did<br />\nnot give them the representation<br />\nthey were entitled to, he urged<br />\nthem to be magnanirnous, and for<br />\nthe sake of harmony to accept it.<br />\nAmong others who spoke were<br />\nCochran Supplee, 14; J. E. Richardson, 'i3; R. Gminder, \"3; L. J.<br /><br />\nwas<br />\n.\\11-. J. Reaney Wolfe,<br />\nappointed head coach of the lacrosse team for the, season of 1913,<br />\nat a meeting of the Athletic Board,<br />\non Monday, November 18. Mr.<br />\nEdward 0. Hulburt, also of 'ii,<br />\nwas appointed assistant coach.<br />\nIt is fortunate for the team that<br />\nReaney Wolfe has been appointed,<br />\nas his selection is the best that<br />\ncould have been made. \u2022 Wolfe is<br />\na player of long experience and he<br />\nhas played a star game on all teams<br />\nof which he has been a member.<br />\nHis first appearance on a Hopkins<br />\nteam was in 1910, when he played<br />\ncenter on the 'Varsity. In 1911 he<br />\nplayed center on the 'Varsity team<br />\nwhich won the championship of the<br />\nUnited States. Last year Wolfe<br />\nplayed with Mount Washington and<br />\nalternated between center and third<br />\ndefence. Not only has he had this<br />\nexperience in playing, but he has<br />\nalso been instructor in athletics at<br />\nthe Country School and the Jefferson School. Another point in favor<br />\nof the new coach is the fact that<br />\nhe is a midfield man, a department<br />\nin which Hopkins has been relatively weak for several years. The<br />\nmembers of the team are delighted<br />\nwith the appointment, and nothing<br />\nbut approval is heard from those<br />\nacquainted with lacrosse affairs.<br />\nThe assistant coach, Eddie Hulburt, is the logical man to work<br />\nwith Wolfe. Hulburt has played<br />\nclose attack, especially, in home and<br />\nfirst attack for three years with the<br />\n'Varsity, and in 1911, was captain<br />\nof the championship team. Last<br />\nyear Hulburt also played for Mount<br />\nWashington, and was the strongest<br />\nman on their close attack. As he<br />\nis now a student at the University,<br />\nand as Ile has played lacrosse only<br />\nthree seasons, Hulburt is eligible<br />\nthis year and will play one of the<br />\nclose attack positions.<br />\nThe selection of the coach is a<br />\nmost important matter, and Hopkins students have good reason to<br />\nrejoice at the choice of Reaney<br />\nWolfe as the head coach. May he<br />\nlead another team to the intercollegiate championship.<br /><br />\nGallaudet succeeded in defeating<br />\nHopkins in football last Saturday<br />\nat Homewood, 16 to 14. The score<br />\nindicates a close game, and the play<br />\nwas fairly even. Hopkins, -however, did not play anything like as<br />\ngood football against the deaf-mutes<br />\nas against St. John's the preceding<br />\nweek. The work of the Hopkins<br />\nteam was disappointing in the extreme to the rooters. Many of the<br />\nplayers appeared to be affected with<br />\na feeling of indifference, and they<br />\n(lid not display the amount of vim<br />\nand spirit that a football team usually has whether it has been winning<br />\nits games or not.<br />\nHopkins ought.to have defeated<br />\nGallaudet, although the Washingtonians were playing good steady<br />\nfootball. As a team, the Hopkins<br />\nplayers did not shake off their listlessness until too late. The visiting team was probably slightly<br />\nheavier than the Black and Blue,<br />\nand man for man,the Kendall Green<br />\nsquad clearly outplayed its opponents.<br />\nThe ball changed hands several<br />\ntimes during the first quarter, but<br />\nneither team was able to score.<br />\nBranham tried a field goal, but his<br />\nkick did not carry the pigskin quite<br />\nto the crossbar, although his aim<br />\nwas true.,<br />\nRandall, of Gallaudet, scored a<br />\ntouchdown in the second period.<br />\nThe mutes carried the ball from the<br />\ncenter of the field to Hopkins' goal<br />\nline by forward passes and end<br />\nruns. Moore kicked goal.<br />\nBranham caught the Gallaudet<br />\nkick-off and carried it to the 25yard line. By line plunging and<br />\nend runs, the pigskin was carried<br />\ninto Gallaudet's territory, only to be<br />\nlost on downs, after some unsticcessful forward passes. Gallaudet<br />\nrecovered some of the lost ground<br />\nand Moore kicked a goal from the<br />\n35-yard line. Hopkins took a momentary brace after the kick-off,<br />\nand crood gains were made by all<br />\nthe Hopkins backs. Bridgeman tallied the first touchdown by slipping<br />\naway to the side of the gridiron<br />\nwithout being noticed and catching<br />\na beautifully thrown pass from Bagley. Branham kicked goal. The<br />\nhalf ended with the score io to 7.<br />\nBagley intercepted a forward pass<br />\nof Gallaudet's, and not only interrupted the mutes' steady progress<br />\ntoward the Hopkins goal line, but<br />\nhe almost scored a touchdown before being tackled. He fumbled<br />\nwhen he was tackled, but Connolly<br />\nrecovered the ball for Hopkins. G.<br /><br />\nWomen's Meeting.<br /><br />\nOn Tuesday, November 26, at 5<br />\nP.

Davis, '93, the well<br />\nknown authority on football.<br />\nAs long ago as 1878, Woodrow<br />\nWilson took an active interest in<br />\nfootball. In the fall of that year<br />\nhe was a \"football director\" at<br />\nPrinceton and cahirman of the<br />\nBoard\u2014a body that we would today<br />\nknow under the name of the coaching committee.
