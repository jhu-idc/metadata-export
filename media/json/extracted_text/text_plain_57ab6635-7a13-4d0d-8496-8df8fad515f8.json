Since then, however, with<br />\nthe establishment of both undergraduate and<br />\nnight school courses in astronomy, the<br />\ntelescope has received much greater usage.<br />\nWhile this 92-year-old telescope is not of high<br />\nenough quality to be used for graduate<br />\nresearch, it is more than adequate for use as<br />\na teaching instrument. Requiring students to<br />\nlearn astronomy only by reading books while<br />\na functional telescope lies dismantled in the<br />\nbasement of Rowland Hall waiting for acceptance to some museum, is a disservice to<br />\nthe Hopkins student body.<br />\nWith the coming of the Space Telescope<br />\nCenter to the Homewood campus, there will<br />\nundoubtedly be a greater emphasis placed on<br />\nastrophysics within the the Physics Department. This was indicated by the Christ Committee report on the future of the Arts and<br />\nSciences division. The next several years will<br />\nlikely see more enrolling undergraduates who<br />\n<br />\nreceive more University money, then one of<br />\nthe priority expenditures should be a new<br />\nobservatory and telescope for student use.<br />\nHowever, this still leaves the short-term<br />\nproblem unsolved. There is no telling when<br />\nor even if a new observatory and telescope<br />\nwill be installed. In the meantime there is a<br />\nneed for a telescope available for student use.<br />\nTrue, there are smaller telescopes available<br />\nthat allow viewing of the stars and planets,<br />\nyet it would be of invaluable benefit to current students to temporarily reassemble the<br />\nold telescope. The cost of building a new<br />\nmakeshift observatory, similar to the one on<br />\nthe freshman quad, with a sliding rooftop, I<br />\nwould probably not be too expensive. This<br />\nshould be done until a new permanent<br />\nsystem is installed.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nAronoff Did Good Job With Clemons Show; Students Are At Fault<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFacts are a very essential part<br />\nof newswriting. Last week's<br />\neditorial concerning the ineptitude of the co-chairmen of the<br />\nConcert Committee ignored<br />\nsome very important facts. It<br />\nwas stated in the article that the<br />\nco-chairmen, Jeff Aronoff and<br />\nTina Bois, made the decision<br />\nto get Clarence against the<br />\nwishes of the committee. What<br />\nyou failed to state, however,<br />\nwas that the committee<br />\nunanimously felt, at the time,<br />\nthat Clarence would sell more<br />\ntickets by a significant margin<br />\nthan the alternate choice, even<br />\nat the high ticket price. Jeff<br />\nfelt, and I think everyone<br />\nwould agree, that this is the<br />\n<br />\nmost important criterion for<br />\nbringing a concert to the<br />\nschool.<br />\nAfter the decision to get<br />\nClarence was made, the preparations began for publicizing<br />\nthe concert. All posters were<br />\nprinted up and ready to go<br />\nwhen some problems developed<br />\nwith the contract for the concert. This was in no way the<br />\nfault of either Tina or Jeff, but<br />\ndue to the delay incurred, was<br />\nprobably the major cause for<br />\nthe poor advance ticket sales.<br />\nAs for saying that the cochairmen \"pursued their duties<br />\nin a non-aggressive manner,\" I<br />\ncan personally attest to the fact<br />\nthat Jeff 'drove .all over<br />\nBaltimore putting posters in<br />\n<br />\nNote Placer Responds To Armon Accusations<br />\n<br />\nbars downtown and at Fells<br />\nPoint, postering in Washington, at the Georgetown andi<br />\nU.M.

In addition to this,<br />\nmembers of the Concert and<br />\nSocial committees postered<br />\nTowson University, Goucher,<br />\nLoyola, Notre Dame and Hopkins, all before the Student<br />\nCouncil intervened on our behalf. Press releases and newspaper ads were also part of our<br />\npublicity campaign.<br />\nThe problems involved with<br />\nbringing a concert to Hopkins<br />\nare great. To find a band with<br />\na big enough name to generate<br />\nstudent interest, and yet inexpensive enough to stay within<br />\nour limited budget, is a difficult<br />\ntask. Even the \"celebrated\"<br />\nRamones concert lost money at<br />\nHopkins. Does anyone else<br />\nremember the Caroline Mas<br />\nfiasco? In short, I feel that Jeff<br />\nAronoff did everything in his<br />\npower to bring a quality, sellable act to Hopkins and the<br />\nfault lies not with him but with<br />\nthe Hopkins community which<br />\nrefuses to endorse a performer<br />\nof Clarence's stature.<br />\n<br />\nCampus Notes have used the<br />\npopular hits \"Downtown,\"<br />\nI admit it.

But some type of grading<br />\nsystem is necessary to satisfy<br />\ntwo needs: to provide the motivation for students w work<br />\nhard, and to measure the performance of students. Various<br />\ntypes of grading systems have<br />\nbeen tried, such as written<br />\nevaluations (Bennington College), but letter grades remain<br />\nthe best alternative.<br />\nOver the last 20 years, the<br />\naverage GPA at Hopkins has<br />\nrisen from about 2.2 to nearly<br />\n3.1. Departments vary; some<br />\nnow give a large percentage of<br />\nB's while the worst inflators<br />\nhand out A's like candy. For<br />\nthe 1982 spring semester, the<br />\npercentage of A's given in the<br />\nfollowing departments, based<br />\non data soon to be published in<br />\nthe Course Guide, are listed:<br />\nMilitary Science, 95 percent;<br />\nBehavioral Biology, 72 percent;<br />\nMechanics, 66 percent; Writing<br />\nSeminars, 63 percent; Near<br />\nEastern Studies, 60 percent;<br />\nand Classics, 59 percent. The<br />\nlarge percentage of A's these<br />\nand other departments hand<br />\nout defeats the purpose of<br />\ngrades. They hardly measure a<br />\nstudent's performance, and<br />\nprovide no incentive for superior work. Also, students will<br />\nchoose electives in such departments only to inflate their<br />\nGPAs, to the detriment of<br />\nstudents who choose tougher<br />\nsubjects. What is needed is a<br />\nUniversity-wide grading policy<br />\nthat would not only equalize<br />\nthe different departments, but<br />\nalso deflate grades overall.<br />\nThe question that now arises<br />\nis, what should these grades be<br />\nbased upon? They can't be<br />\nhanded out arbitrarily; this<br />\nwouldn't measure a student's<br />\naccomplishments. They are often based on the professor's<br />\nstandards, which is good in that<br />\nit provides sufficient motivation for students to work hard.<br />\nThe fault of this system lies in<br />\nthe nonuniformity of standards<br />\nset by different professors. One<br />\nyear a class might receive all A's<br />\nand B's, and the next year a different professor might give a<br />\nclass of equal quality all C's.<br />\nObviously, the most consistent and fairest way to grade a<br />\n<br />\nstudent is by comparison with<br />\nhis peers. This means distributing grades by means of a curve<br />\nbased on the class average.<br />\nCurves are not perfect; they are<br />\nunfair for small classes where<br />\nlarge gaps can be left in the<br />\ngrade distribution. In these<br />\ncases, grades should be decided by the professor's standards,<br />\nwhich are often based upon an<br />\nimaginary curve of past students' performances. Another<br />\nproblem with curves is't hat they<br />\ncreate competition among students, which detracts from the<br />\nlearning process; competing for<br />\nthe grade becomes more important than striving for knowledge. However, whether a person is competitive or not, learning to deal with competition<br />\nnow is probably better than being faced with it later in the job<br />\nmarket and being unable to<br />\ncope with it.<br />\nThe University needs to set<br />\ngrading guidelines. A policy for<br />\nclasses of 20 or more students<br />\nwould operate along the following lines: 15 percent A's; 30<br />\npercent B's; 45 percent C's; and<br />\n10 percent D's; with failures<br />\nonly given rarely. This would<br />\ndecrease disparity between<br />\ndepartments, and also deflate<br />\ngrades.<br />\nIf grades were deflated at<br />\nHopkins, compensation would<br />\nbe necessary to make comparisons with students from<br />\nother institutions possible. This<br />\ncould be accomplished by adding two things to transcripts.<br />\nFirst, academic information on<br />\nthe students as a group would<br />\nbe needed to establish the quality of undergraduates at Hopkins.<br />\nPresident Muller tells every<br />\nfreshman class how great they<br />\nare with lots of statistics, and<br />\nsurely information of this type<br />\nis available for the graduating<br />\nclass. Also needed on the tran.scripts would be the grading<br />\nguidelines outlined above, the<br />\naverage GPAs of the class as a<br />\nwhole, and the average GPAs<br />\nof the students in the appropriate major. This would<br />\nmake comparison of a student<br />\nwith' his peers possible to give<br />\nan accurate measure of his accomplishments. The above proposal would create fairer, more<br />\nmeaningful grades without putting Hopkins graduates at a<br />\ndisadvantage. It could even<br />\nstart a trend.<br />\n<br />\nWake p/<br />\n<br />\nMy 1105C Is<br />\nC.CLU3h, 1n --1ile<br />\n<br />\num... can...<br />\n<br />\nbook<br />\n<br />\nJHU Student Council<br />\n<br />\nOur Undemocratic Representatives<br />\nBY CYRIL GUILLOT<br />\n<br />\nSince the beginning of the<br />\nacademic year, the Student<br />\nCouncil has continued along its<br />\nnormal course of action and inaction. The traditional bureaucratic bungling of the council<br />\nbody has been combined with<br />\nthe equally traditional hard<br />\nwork of the Student Life and<br />\nother council committees who<br />\ncommit themselves to specific<br />\ntasks in the interests of the student body. But this year has<br />\nwitnessed a shift in the methods<br />\nand principles of the Student<br />\nCouncil. for certain elements in<br />\nthe Student Council have adopted a consistent pattern of<br />\nwielding power undemocratically and disregarding the interests<br />\nof students and student groups.<br />\nThe year began with a \"bang.\"<br />\nWe all heard of an event that<br />\nwould raise eyebrows in any<br />\ndemocratic country; our student government annulled the<br />\nelection of a candidate (Grant<br />\nLally) who had received an absolute majority of vote, but<br />\nwho happened to be unpopular<br />\nwith the leading officers of the<br />\nStudent Council. Combined<br />\nwith the council's refusal to<br />\nhold a student referendum to<br />\nresolve the issue, this episode<br />\nmarked the beginning of the<br />\ncouncil's disregard for the<br />\ndemocratic process in general,<br />\nand the voting rights of JHU<br />\nstudents in particular. It is very<br />\nwell to be a member of a congenial clique, but such should<br />\n<br />\nnot be a prerequisite for membership in a democratic institution.<br />\nThe SAC is supposed to be<br />\nan autonomous organization by<br />\nwhich different student groups<br />\ncome together to govern themselves. Instead of showing respect for the special needs of<br />\nstudent groups, the Student<br />\nCouncil has responded to the<br />\nSAC with one power move<br />\nafter another. By virtue of a<br />\nloophole in the SAC constitution, the council unilaterally<br />\nvoted to empower itself with<br />\nthe right to alter the SAC's constitution, and inform the SAC<br />\ngroups only after the fact. On<br />\ntop of this, the Student Council initially adopted a policy of<br />\nreviewing and revoting almost<br />\nevery decision approved by the<br />\nSAC Executive Board. These<br />\npolicies continued to the point<br />\nwhere one wondered whether<br />\nthe SAC continued to exist as<br />\nan autonomous body. Although<br />\nthese power grabs of the Student Council were later halted,<br />\nit becomes clear that the council is unwilling to share power<br />\nwith any other organization on<br />\ncampus, and will adopt almost<br />\nany means necessary to centralize power within the council's domain.<br />\nAll individual student groups<br />\nshould expect a certain amount<br />\nof fairness and respect from<br />\nour Student Council. But in attacking the PSU, the Student<br />\nCouncil failed to act in good<br />\nfaith.

And when the PSU<br />\nstill managed to defend itself so<br />\nthat the SAC Executive Board<br />\nvoted to drop all charges, the<br />\nStudent Council president and<br />\ntreasurer instructed the PSU<br />\nthat no further charges would<br />\nbe presented at the next Student<br />\nCouncil meeting. Next, the<br />\ntreasurer personally telephoned<br />\nmembers of the PSU to inform<br />\nthem that no resolutions would<br />\nbe introduced to ban the PSU.<br />\nBut on the very night after the<br />\nphone calls, the Student Council once again entertained a motion to ban the PSU from official existence on this campus.<br />\nBefore recommending to decharter or voting to decharter<br />\nthe group, the council should<br />\nhave the decency to notify the<br />\ngroup a few days in advance, so<br />\nthat the group can defend itself.<br />\nEvidently, in its haste to ban the<br />\nPSU, the Student Council forgot about the concepts of fair<br />\nplay and due process.<br />\nBut these dirty tricks against<br />\nthe PSU were not isolated to<br />\nthis event or to this group. As<br />\ncan be seen, similar tactics were<br />\nutilized against other groups.<br />\nUnder the leadership of Student Council officers, the SAC<br />\nExecutive Board assured an<br />\naspiring Nuclear Freeze group<br />\nthat its charter would be okayed if the group changed its<br />\nname by dropping the word<br />\n\"Freeze.\" When the group<br />\nreturned the next week as the<br />\nStudents for Social Responsibility, the council officers informed the group that the deal<br />\nwas off, and no charter would<br />\nbe granted. Tactics like these<br />\ndemonstrate that the decision<br />\nwas based more on political<br />\nbiases than on a rational review<br />\nof the merits of the Freeze<br />\ngroup.

In addition, it should<br />\nbe noted that the term \"antiSemitic\" is used primarily in<br />\nreference to antiiiewish expressions.

In the<br />\nOctober 29 News-Letter, the<br />\ncharges brought against the<br />\nPSU by SC are technical, superficial and irrevelant, of the type<br />\nthat all student organizations<br />\nmay be found guilty of scrutinized in the same way. Such<br />\ncharges seem to intend to cover<br />\nup the REAL REASONS for<br />\nwhich SC expressed so strongly the intent to \"decharter\" the<br />\nPSU (cf. News-Letter of October 22). The SC recommendation to decharter PSU was a<br />\ndirect response to the appeal by<br />\nthe JSA president and resulted<br />\nfrom the October 20 \"teach-in\"<br />\non the Middle East sponsored<br />\nby the PSU.<br />\nThe original grievances of<br />\nJSA against PSU stated clearly<br />\nthat the Jewish Student Association (which earlier had tried to<br />\ncancel another lecture by a proPalestinian guest sponsored by<br />\nthe Chaplain's office) objects to<br />\nthe very idea of any Palestinian<br />\nor pro-Palestinian guest or topic. JSA accused the speakers of<br />\nbeing sympathisers of the \"terrorist\" PLO, which could not<br />\naccept the fact that a pro-Israeli<br />\nspokesman was not included,<br />\nwere surprised and ANGRY<br />\nthat nonstudents were included<br />\nin the audience, etc. The logical<br />\nanswers to such claims should<br />\nbe obvious: According to the<br />\ndemocratic law of this country,<br />\nall individuals and groups have<br />\nthe right to free speech, including Jewish [sic] and Palestinians, Pro-Israelis and proPalestinians alike. No logic or<br />\nregulation makes it obligatory<br />\nor necessarily useful to include<br />\na pro-Israeli speaker in EVERY<br />\ndiscussion of the Middle East,<br />\nnor should EVERY event have<br />\nto take the form of a panel<br />\ndiscussion. No emotional at-<br />\n<br />\nCorrection<br />\nIn Amy Armon's letter in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter, \"fundamentally separatist leanings\"<br />\nshould have read, \"fundamentalist/separatist.\" The NewsLetter regrets this error.<br />\n<br />\ntachment, or religious, political, national or other commitment gives the right to any<br />\ngroup or individual to tell<br />\nothers what events to sponsor<br />\nor to attend, much less to<br />\npunish them if they disobey.<br />\nThe \"teach-in\" on the Middle<br />\nEast was a public event and it<br />\nshould not surprise the JSA<br />\nthat students as well as nonstudents CHOSE to attend.<br />\nAs it is, the JSA (having<br />\nacted under the influence of<br />\ntheir emotions, biases and prejudices, to which they are entitled) violated other people's<br />\nFirst Amendment rights on October 20 when they tried first to<br />\nprevent and then disrupt the<br />\nPSU-sponsored public meeting.<br />\nThey disregarded the right of<br />\nother student groups to have<br />\ntheir own organizations by ask:<br />\ning that the SC and SAC decharter the PSU. The eagerness<br />\nwith which the SC voted on October 20 to decharter the PSU<br />\nproves them rushed, immature<br />\nand partial against PSU. SC<br />\nPresident [sic) Mr. Davis went<br />\nso far as to threaten, in a dictatorial tone, that if SAC did<br />\nnot vote to decharter PSU, he<br />\nwould do so ON HIS OWN,<br />\nexercising some right given to<br />\nhim by the SC charter. If the<br />\nSC charter gives indeed the<br />\nright to any Mr. Davis to<br />\ndecharter any student organization because his political views<br />\ndiffer from those of that<br />\norganization, then the charter<br />\nitself should be subject to revision and improvement. In all<br />\nJSA and SC statements (cf.<br />\nNews-Letter October 22) an<br />\nanti-Palestinian and anti-PSU<br />\nbias prevailed, respectively.<br />\nThat is why we are concerned<br />\nthat in February, the final decision regarding PSU status, may<br />\n, be biased and resulting from<br />\npolitical rather than charterrelated considerations. The<br />\nthreat to \"decharter\" PSU<br />\nbecasue of JSA and SC disapproval of the guests of the October 20 meeting seems quite<br />\nreal. We maintain that the PSU<br />\nshould not be made to feel that<br />\nit owes any apologies for exercising their rights as an EQUAL<br />\nand legitimate student organization and for sponsoring an<br />\nevent of their choosing. Much<br />\nless should the PSU live under<br />\nthe threat of being voted OUT<br />\nOF EXISTENCE. If the JSA<br />\nwere to prevail on the SC of all,<br />\nstudents and citizens, guaranteed under the First Amendment would be dangerously<br />\nviolated.<br />\nE.

That<br />\nis, they met again in the Garrett<br />\nRoom for their final general<br />\nmeeting of the semester. This<br />\ntime, however, fewer people<br />\n...showed up, but they still made<br />\nas much sense as they did last<br />\ntime.<br />\nThe meeting began promptly at 3:00, or at least that's what<br />\neveryone told me. But it didn't<br />\nreally begin until a little beiore<br />\n3:30. I'll explain. For a meeting<br />\nto get underway, a quorum<br />\nconsisting of 24 groups has to<br />\nbe present, but it wasn't achieved until Dwight Wilson, a<br />\nmember of the Executive<br />\nBoard, changed his quorum<br />\nvote from HOPSFA to the<br />\nBicycle Club.<br />\nAnyway, without a quorum,<br />\nno motions can be raised, but<br />\npeople are still able to talk, so<br />\nof course they did, although I<br />\nwasn't there to hear them because I arrived just as the<br />\nquorum was reached. What<br />\nthey talked about beforehand<br />\nwasn't all that important<br />\nthough, or.at least that's what<br />\nthe people who had talked told<br />\nme.\u2022<br />\nThen Harry--you remember<br />\nMr. Davis\u2014took control of the<br />\nmeeting. He had grown a beard<br />\nsince the last meeting, but he<br />\nstill treated his commission<br />\nmembers with the same respect<br />\nhe had always shown them.<br />\nIt was 3:35 p.m.<br />\nHarry informed everyone<br />\nthat the man on the portrait<br />\nhanging behind him was Milton<br />\nS. Eisenhower. He then asked<br />\nme to be seated. Then, and only then, did the meeting begin.<br />\n\"The chair recognizes Jim<br />\nSalles.\"<br />\n\"Thank you. I'll try to make<br />\nthis short.\"<br />\n\"Please do.\"<br />\nOf course, he didn't.- He<br />\nspoke about a new SAC constitution that he had typed, correlated and distributed. And<br />\nwhen he was talking, everyone<br />\nelse was either laughing with<br />\nJim or reading the financial section of USA Today, as JSA<br />\nPresident Seth Kaye and Col-<br />\n<br />\nlege Republican President Brian<br />\nMirsky were doing. But nothing<br />\nstopped Jim, who, by the way,<br />\nhad had his hair cut for the<br />\noccasion.<br />\n\"Mr. Salles. Could you<br />\nplease keep your comments<br />\nshort.\"<br />\n\"You said I had five minutes. I believe it's only been two<br />\nand a half. But anyhow, allow<br />\nme to have a one-minute<br />\ndigression.\"<br />\n\"Please do.\"<br />\n\"Okay. The main problem<br />\nthat exists here is that the<br />\nchecks and balances between<br />\nthe SAC and Student Council<br />\nhave been rendered contradictory. They have been perverted.<br />\nThey have been stamped out. I<br />\nknow that neither Debby Jeffrey nor Chuck Peifer are here<br />\nto defend themselves, but I sure<br />\nwould give an eyetooth to see<br />\nthem try. And allow me to say<br />\nthat these comments are mine<br />\nand not those of the constitutional committee.\"<br />\nJim sat down and proceeded<br />\nto chain-smoke the rest of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\n\"The chair recognizes Wayne<br />\nKimball.\"<br />\n\"A point of information<br />\nhere. Am I to understand ...\"<br />\nThank you, Wayne. I have<br />\nno idea what he said after that.<br />\n\"The chair recognizes Mr.<br />\nSalles again.\"<br />\nHe responded to whatever<br />\nWayne said, and then all of a<br />\nsudden he suggested that a\u2022Second Annual Debby Jeffrey<br />\nConstitutional Amendment be<br />\nvoted on. But Harry, as he<br />\nalways does, had a quick reply.<br />\n\"Why don't we not and<br />\ncontinue.\"<br />\nJim digressed once again, sat<br />\ndo\u2018\u2018 n again, but didn't light<br />\nanother cigarette until Wayne<br />\nasked to be recognized again.<br />\nHarry then asked Wayne to address the meeting up front at<br />\nthe podium.<br />\n\"I am ashamed to be a part<br />\nof this constitution.

But I'll<br />\nsupport it reluctantly because<br />\nthe committee has promised me<br />\nother considerations in return.\"<br />\nAs Wayne was talking, Alan<br />\nKarras., a member of the Executive Board, and Andrew<br />\nHurley, editor of the NewsLetter, walked directly in front<br />\nof the podium and out the<br />\ndoor. Meanwhile, Stu Pollack,<br />\nanother board member, was<br />\nplaying tic-tac-toe with himself.<br />\n\"I would also like to make<br />\none proposal which can be<br />\nbroken down into parts A and<br />\nB...\"<br />\nMitchell Smith, production<br />\nmanager for the Course Guide,<br />\nwas then recognized by Harry.<br />\nHe spoke about a lot of fractions concerning Wayne's subproposal B, such as two-thirds<br />\nand four-fifths, and only once<br />\ndid he mention the word majority. No one really listened to<br />\nMitchell, but then again, no<br />\none ever does.<br />\nBoth of Wayne's sub-proposals were voted down. It was<br />\n4:23.<br />\nAt 4:24, Ted Hayes, editor of<br />\nthe Course Guide, asked Harry<br />\nfor a quorum. It was at this<br />\ntime that Ted Hill, former<br />\npresident of the Barnstormers,<br />\nran out of the room.<br />\nHarry then took a quorum<br />\nvote. Only II groups responded, although there were more<br />\nlike 25 representatives present.<br />\n\"We do not have a quorum,<br />\ntherefore this meeting is<br />\nadjourned.\"<br />\nBut Harry had forgotten<br />\nabout Grant Lally, who wanted<br />\nto talk about something which<br />\nI won't mention because the<br />\nonly reason he brought it up in<br />\nthe first place was to get attention. Sorry, Grant.<br />\nSeth Kaye then asked for an<br />\nadjournment, which was unanimously accepted.

Sophomore Paul Stader<br />\nacknowledges the role his scholarship<br />\nplayed in his decision to join ROTC,.<br />\nsaying frankly that it would be \"impossible for me to go to Hopkins<br />\nwithout my scholarship.\" Another<br />\ncadet sees it as a reciprocal relationship. \"The Army gets what it<br />\nwants--officers\u2014and I get a chance<br />\nto go to the school I want to.\" Of the<br />\nestimated 45 Hopkins students currently enrolled in the program, which<br />\ndraws people from other area schools<br />\nlike UMBC, Goucher and Towson,<br />\n37 are now on scholarships.<br />\nA second reason given by several\u2022<br />\nfor joining ROTC was activicadets<br />\na<br />\nty. Says Stader, \"They've got to be<br />\none of the most active groups on<br />\ncampus.\" From the basic program of<br />\nphysical training, field exercises and<br />\nPentagon field trips to special<br />\nmilitary interest programs, like<br />\nparatrooper or Rangers' training,<br />\nROTC offers a wide variety of options. As almost every cadet will tell<br />\nyou, the real worth of the program<br />\nbecomes apparent only when you<br />\nbecome involved. As cadet Messick<br />\nput it, \"You get out of it what you<br />\nput into it.\"<br />\nAnother attraction of the ROTC<br />\nprogram is the lure of a guaranteed<br />\njob after graduation. Most cadets will<br />\nopt for that special branch of the ser-<br />\n<br />\nvice that corresponds to their field of<br />\ninterest, like engineering or law. Says<br />\nMessick, \"My IR (International<br />\nRelations) major won't exactly be<br />\nbankable.\" He added that ROTC is<br />\nmore a ticket to a job, preferably in<br />\nhis case, in military intelligence, than<br />\nan opportunity for him to learn to<br />\nlead troops into combat. Major Ball<br />\nadmits that \"the attractiveness of the<br />\nArmy swings with the economy.\"<br />\nROTC obviously, then, has the attractions to interest students, but<br />\nthese attractions have a price. The<br />\nstudents, and ROTC itself, have to<br />\nfulfill certain functions within the<br />\nU.S. Army.<br />\nMajor Ball stated that with<br />\n\"America's historical preference for<br />\na small standing army, the Army's<br />\ngoal has become the creation of a<br />\nstore of quality reserves to support an<br />\nactive nucleus.\" Colonel Fried concurs: \"Our aim is not to produce<br />\ncareer military officers,\" but to<br />\nassure an adequate supply of men<br />\nand women with officer training in<br />\nthe event of a national emergency.<br />\nThe ROTC program ideally produces<br />\nthese quality officers. Fried stressed<br />\nthe value of a Hopkins education,<br />\nholding thai the first priority of<br />\nROTC is to ensure that every student<br />\nobtains his or her degree.<br />\nAs one cadet put it: \"A ROTC<br />\nprogram reflects its school.\" Here,<br />\nthat means \"academics and individualism\" and hence, this cadet<br />\nsays, the program \"is about as good<br />\nas it could be within the boundaries<br />\nset by the school and the prevailing<br />\nattitudes of its students.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f\"My old granny was ninety-one, she did P.T. just for fun. . .

Included in this additional<br />\nspace are galleries, a lecture room, a<br />\nclassroom, a members' room, a cafe<br />\nthat overlooks the sculpture garden, and<br />\na 400-seat auditorium.<br />\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that the<br />\nmuseum now has the opportunity to<br />\nopen part of its building for events in<br />\nthe evening; with the facilities of the new<br />\nwing, the entire structure need not be<br />\nopened, and the large costs associated<br />\nwith more security guards are eliminated. Among the evening activities now<br />\nheld in the museum are the Thursday<br />\nscreenings of the Baltimore Film Forum.<br />\nHarper emphasized that the architects<br />\nof the new wing paid special attention<br />\nto the functions of the wing while incorporating it into the original structure.<br />\nAmong the building's new features are<br />\na terrace that looks out onto the park<br />\nin front of the museum, and the creation, on the lower floor, of a new eastwest axis of galleries and open space.<br />\nThe collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art covers a wide range of<br />\ntastes. The fact that nearly every type of<br />\nart is represented means that the casual<br />\nobserver, as well as the diehard enthusiast, can be satisfied. Among its<br />\nparticularly strong assemblages of art is<br />\nthe Cone Collection of primarily French<br />\n<br />\nUpdike:<br />\nBech<br />\nRedux<br />\nC'011f. from p. 15<br />\n<br />\nThe New Museum Cafe looks out on the sculpture garden.<br />\n<br />\npaintings and sculpture of the early<br />\ntwentieth century. Included within this<br />\ncollection are 42 oils and 18 sculptures<br />\nby Henri Matisse, and numerous other<br />\nworks by Picasso, Cezanne and Monet.<br />\nIt is difficult to imagine a room 50 feet<br />\nby about 50 feet entirely filled with<br />\nworks by Matisse, but the museum indeed contains such a room.<br />\nIf your tastes are to the slightly less<br />\nextreme, there are works by Van Gogh,<br />\nDegas, Renoir and Gauguin. For those<br />\ninterested in modern art, there are works<br />\nby Andy Warhol and a soon-arriving exhibition of neon light work by Bruce<br />\nNowman. Another \"must\" is the display of posters and lithographs by<br />\nToulouse-Lautrec.<br />\nThere is also the Old Masters gallery,<br />\nwith works by Rembrandt, Raphael,<br />\nand many others. If you prefer American painters, you can see Benjamin<br />\nWest's self-portrait, the works of<br />\n<br />\nThomas Hart Benton, and Winslow<br />\n: Homer's paintings. Among many other<br />\ninteresting items are a stained-glass window by Louis Tiffany that is about 3<br />\nfeet wide and 12 feet tall, an early<br />\nbronze casting of Rodin's Thinker that<br />\nis about eight feet tall, and numerous<br />\nAntioch mosaics from the fifth to the<br />\neighth centuries A.D. There are galleries<br />\ndevoted to sporting art; the art of<br />\nAfrica, the Americas and Oceania; the<br />\nEuropean and American decorative arts;<br />\nand the special exhibition of Imperial<br />\ncostumes of the Manchu Dynasty.<br />\nBut so much said for pieces of art; the<br />\nbest way to experience the new layout<br />\nis to visit it.

The structure is partially responsible for this; since it isn't<br />\na novel but a collection of pieces, the<br />\nbook is unable to create a cumulative effect, and since none of the episodes are<br />\ntrue short stories, the impact of each is<br />\nno greater than the sum of its individual<br />\nmoments.<br />\nEarly on in the narrative Updike says:<br />\n\"Great books begin with tiny hints ...<br />\nand Bech had begun his messy accumulation of pages with little more<br />\nthan a hum, a hum that ... was, it' not<br />\nthe meaning of life, the tenor of meaninglessness in our late-twentieth-century,<br />\npost-numinous, industrial-consumeristic<br />\ncivilization, North American branch,<br />\nMiddle Atlantic subdivision.\" That hum<br />\ncan also be heard, faintly, throughout<br />\nBech is Back, but to the reader's loss,<br />\nUpdike never attempts to raise its<br />\nvolume.<br />\n<br />\nThe Placement Bureau<br />\nInterview Schedule<br />\nManTech International<br />\nRutgers Graduate School of Business<br />\nZeger-Abrams<br />\nSignal Science<br />\nPace University Graduate School of Business<br />\n<br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS:<br />\n<br />\nNaval Surface Weapons Center<br />\nNavy Nuclear Power Program<br />\nAlbuquerque Public Schools<br />\n<br />\n11/17.<br />\n<br />\nGTE-Sylvania<br />\nGoddard Space Flight Center<br />\nSignal Science<br />\nGeorgetown Graduate School of Business<br />\n11/19.<br />\n<br />\nConDiesel Mobile Equipment Group<br />\nBendix Field Engineering (rescheduled)<br />\n<br />\n11/29.<br />\n<br />\nLitton A mecom<br />\nTufts-Fletcher School of Lass and Diplomacy<br />\n<br />\n11/30.<br />\n<br />\nI.utron Electronics<br />\nMIT Sloan<br />\n<br />\ncome to the Placement Bureau, in the<br />\n*If interested in an of the above.

As exciting as this may sound, the<br />\nrace will probably be anticlimactic compared to last<br />\nweekend's MAC championships,<br />\nheld on the above course. In<br />\ngeneral, the MACs are more<br />\nmeaningful because competition is among Division III<br />\nschools and it is the only opportunity for the team to gauge accurately its performance in the<br />\nconference, considering the<br />\nharriers raced only four MAC<br />\nschools during the season. Unlike last year, when two outstanding performances saved<br />\nthe team from embarrassment,<br />\nthis year's team ran cohesively<br />\nand it was the result of a concentrated team effort that Hopkins placed a very respectable<br />\nseventh out of 17 teams represented. Senior rookie Kathy<br />\nConnally had her best race of<br />\nthe season after being hindered<br />\nby a pulled muscle. She traversed the 5K course in 20:40, and<br />\npaced Hopkins with her 26th<br />\nplace finish. Also scoring for<br />\nHopkins were Janice Brill<br />\n(20:52), Jackie Chen (21:03),<br />\nKaren Gressmir (21:19) and<br />\nTami Oki (21:35), who all<br />\nfinished within one minute of<br />\nConnally.

For students attending<br />\nthe University that will house the Space<br />\nTelescope Center, this is an insult.<br />\nUp until twelve years ago, the huge<br />\ntelescope that formerly sat in the freshman<br />\nquad and which is owned by the Physics<br />\nDepartment was used only sporadically by<br />\nHopkins students. Since then, however, with<br />\nthe establishment of both undergraduate and<br />\nnight school courses in astronomy, the<br />\ntelescope has received much greater usage.<br />\nWhile this 92-year-old telescope is not of high<br />\nenough quality to be used for graduate<br />\nresearch, it is more than adequate for use as<br />\na teaching instrument. Requiring students to<br />\nlearn astronomy only by reading books while<br />\na functional telescope lies dismantled in the<br />\nbasement of Rowland Hall waiting for acceptance to some museum, is a disservice to<br />\nthe Hopkins student body.<br />\nWith the coming of the Space Telescope<br />\nCenter to the Homewood campus, there will<br />\nundoubtedly be a greater emphasis placed on<br />\nastrophysics within the the Physics Department. This was indicated by the Christ Committee report on the future of the Arts and<br />\nSciences division. The next several years will<br />\nlikely see more enrolling undergraduates who<br /><br />\nreceive more University money, then one of<br />\nthe priority expenditures should be a new<br />\nobservatory and telescope for student use.<br />\nHowever, this still leaves the short-term<br />\nproblem unsolved.

In the meantime there is a<br />\nneed for a telescope available for student use.<br />\nTrue, there are smaller telescopes available<br />\nthat allow viewing of the stars and planets,<br />\nyet it would be of invaluable benefit to current students to temporarily reassemble the<br />\nold telescope.

Last week's<br />\neditorial concerning the ineptitude of the co-chairmen of the<br />\nConcert Committee ignored<br />\nsome very important facts. It<br />\nwas stated in the article that the<br />\nco-chairmen, Jeff Aronoff and<br />\nTina Bois, made the decision<br />\nto get Clarence against the<br />\nwishes of the committee. What<br />\nyou failed to state, however,<br />\nwas that the committee<br />\nunanimously felt, at the time,<br />\nthat Clarence would sell more<br />\ntickets by a significant margin<br />\nthan the alternate choice, even<br />\nat the high ticket price. Jeff<br />\nfelt, and I think everyone<br />\nwould agree, that this is the<br /><br />\nmost important criterion for<br />\nbringing a concert to the<br />\nschool.<br />\nAfter the decision to get<br />\nClarence was made, the preparations began for publicizing<br />\nthe concert. All posters were<br />\nprinted up and ready to go<br />\nwhen some problems developed<br />\nwith the contract for the concert. This was in no way the<br />\nfault of either Tina or Jeff, but<br />\ndue to the delay incurred, was<br />\nprobably the major cause for<br />\nthe poor advance ticket sales.<br />\nAs for saying that the cochairmen \"pursued their duties<br />\nin a non-aggressive manner,\" I<br />\ncan personally attest to the fact<br />\nthat Jeff 'drove .all over<br />\nBaltimore putting posters in<br /><br />\nNote Placer Responds To Armon Accusations<br /><br />\nbars downtown and at Fells<br />\nPoint, postering in Washington, at the Georgetown andi<br />\nU.M.

Even the \"celebrated\"<br />\nRamones concert lost money at<br />\nHopkins. Does anyone else<br />\nremember the Caroline Mas<br />\nfiasco? In short, I feel that Jeff<br />\nAronoff did everything in his<br />\npower to bring a quality, sellable act to Hopkins and the<br />\nfault lies not with him but with<br />\nthe Hopkins community which<br />\nrefuses to endorse a performer<br />\nof Clarence's stature.<br /><br />\nCampus Notes have used the<br />\npopular hits \"Downtown,\"<br />\nI admit it.

But some type of grading<br />\nsystem is necessary to satisfy<br />\ntwo needs: to provide the motivation for students w work<br />\nhard, and to measure the performance of students. Various<br />\ntypes of grading systems have<br />\nbeen tried, such as written<br />\nevaluations (Bennington College), but letter grades remain<br />\nthe best alternative.<br />\nOver the last 20 years, the<br />\naverage GPA at Hopkins has<br />\nrisen from about 2.2 to nearly<br />\n3.1. Departments vary; some<br />\nnow give a large percentage of<br />\nB's while the worst inflators<br />\nhand out A's like candy. For<br />\nthe 1982 spring semester, the<br />\npercentage of A's given in the<br />\nfollowing departments, based<br />\non data soon to be published in<br />\nthe Course Guide, are listed:<br />\nMilitary Science, 95 percent;<br />\nBehavioral Biology, 72 percent;<br />\nMechanics, 66 percent; Writing<br />\nSeminars, 63 percent; Near<br />\nEastern Studies, 60 percent;<br />\nand Classics, 59 percent. The<br />\nlarge percentage of A's these<br />\nand other departments hand<br />\nout defeats the purpose of<br />\ngrades. They hardly measure a<br />\nstudent's performance, and<br />\nprovide no incentive for superior work. Also, students will<br />\nchoose electives in such departments only to inflate their<br />\nGPAs, to the detriment of<br />\nstudents who choose tougher<br />\nsubjects. What is needed is a<br />\nUniversity-wide grading policy<br />\nthat would not only equalize<br />\nthe different departments, but<br />\nalso deflate grades overall.<br />\nThe question that now arises<br />\nis, what should these grades be<br />\nbased upon? They can't be<br />\nhanded out arbitrarily; this<br />\nwouldn't measure a student's<br />\naccomplishments. They are often based on the professor's<br />\nstandards, which is good in that<br />\nit provides sufficient motivation for students to work hard.<br />\nThe fault of this system lies in<br />\nthe nonuniformity of standards<br />\nset by different professors. One<br />\nyear a class might receive all A's<br />\nand B's, and the next year a different professor might give a<br />\nclass of equal quality all C's.<br />\nObviously, the most consistent and fairest way to grade a<br /><br />\nstudent is by comparison with<br />\nhis peers. This means distributing grades by means of a curve<br />\nbased on the class average.<br />\nCurves are not perfect; they are<br />\nunfair for small classes where<br />\nlarge gaps can be left in the<br />\ngrade distribution. In these<br />\ncases, grades should be decided by the professor's standards,<br />\nwhich are often based upon an<br />\nimaginary curve of past students' performances. Another<br />\nproblem with curves is't hat they<br />\ncreate competition among students, which detracts from the<br />\nlearning process; competing for<br />\nthe grade becomes more important than striving for knowledge. However, whether a person is competitive or not, learning to deal with competition<br />\nnow is probably better than being faced with it later in the job<br />\nmarket and being unable to<br />\ncope with it.<br />\nThe University needs to set<br />\ngrading guidelines. A policy for<br />\nclasses of 20 or more students<br />\nwould operate along the following lines: 15 percent A's; 30<br />\npercent B's; 45 percent C's; and<br />\n10 percent D's; with failures<br />\nonly given rarely. This would<br />\ndecrease disparity between<br />\ndepartments, and also deflate<br />\ngrades.<br />\nIf grades were deflated at<br />\nHopkins, compensation would<br />\nbe necessary to make comparisons with students from<br />\nother institutions possible. This<br />\ncould be accomplished by adding two things to transcripts.<br />\nFirst, academic information on<br />\nthe students as a group would<br />\nbe needed to establish the quality of undergraduates at Hopkins.<br />\nPresident Muller tells every<br />\nfreshman class how great they<br />\nare with lots of statistics, and<br />\nsurely information of this type<br />\nis available for the graduating<br />\nclass. Also needed on the tran.scripts would be the grading<br />\nguidelines outlined above, the<br />\naverage GPAs of the class as a<br />\nwhole, and the average GPAs<br />\nof the students in the appropriate major. This would<br />\nmake comparison of a student<br />\nwith' his peers possible to give<br />\nan accurate measure of his accomplishments. The above proposal would create fairer, more<br />\nmeaningful grades without putting Hopkins graduates at a<br />\ndisadvantage. It could even<br />\nstart a trend.<br /><br />\nWake p/<br /><br />\nMy 1105C Is<br />\nC.CLU3h, 1n --1ile<br /><br />\num... can...<br /><br />\nbook<br /><br />\nJHU Student Council<br /><br />\nOur Undemocratic Representatives<br />\nBY CYRIL GUILLOT<br /><br />\nSince the beginning of the<br />\nacademic year, the Student<br />\nCouncil has continued along its<br />\nnormal course of action and inaction. The traditional bureaucratic bungling of the council<br />\nbody has been combined with<br />\nthe equally traditional hard<br />\nwork of the Student Life and<br />\nother council committees who<br />\ncommit themselves to specific<br />\ntasks in the interests of the student body. But this year has<br />\nwitnessed a shift in the methods<br />\nand principles of the Student<br />\nCouncil. for certain elements in<br />\nthe Student Council have adopted a consistent pattern of<br />\nwielding power undemocratically and disregarding the interests<br />\nof students and student groups.<br />\nThe year began with a \"bang.\"<br />\nWe all heard of an event that<br />\nwould raise eyebrows in any<br />\ndemocratic country; our student government annulled the<br />\nelection of a candidate (Grant<br />\nLally) who had received an absolute majority of vote, but<br />\nwho happened to be unpopular<br />\nwith the leading officers of the<br />\nStudent Council. Combined<br />\nwith the council's refusal to<br />\nhold a student referendum to<br />\nresolve the issue, this episode<br />\nmarked the beginning of the<br />\ncouncil's disregard for the<br />\ndemocratic process in general,<br />\nand the voting rights of JHU<br />\nstudents in particular. It is very<br />\nwell to be a member of a congenial clique, but such should<br /><br />\nnot be a prerequisite for membership in a democratic institution.<br />\nThe SAC is supposed to be<br />\nan autonomous organization by<br />\nwhich different student groups<br />\ncome together to govern themselves. Instead of showing respect for the special needs of<br />\nstudent groups, the Student<br />\nCouncil has responded to the<br />\nSAC with one power move<br />\nafter another. By virtue of a<br />\nloophole in the SAC constitution, the council unilaterally<br />\nvoted to empower itself with<br />\nthe right to alter the SAC's constitution, and inform the SAC<br />\ngroups only after the fact. On<br />\ntop of this, the Student Council initially adopted a policy of<br />\nreviewing and revoting almost<br />\nevery decision approved by the<br />\nSAC Executive Board.

I did not break into and<br />\ndisrupt the ,Student Council<br />\nmeeting and demand that the<br />\nPSU be dechartered. If Ms. Armon had bothered to read the<br />\nNews-Letter properly that<br />\nweek, she would have known<br />\nthat my special request to address the council was approved<br />\nby unanimous consent.

In addition, it should<br />\nbe noted that the term \"antiSemitic\" is used primarily in<br />\nreference to antiiiewish expressions. As to the question of<br />\nwhether Israelis or Palestinian<br />\nArabs are more Semitic, it is<br />\nbasically irrelevant and as a<br />\nJew, I have a severe distaste for<br />\narguing matters of racial and<br />\nethnic purity.<br />\nThe Kosher Dining Hall and<br />\nthe Sabbath services held there<br />\nare supported by the National<br />\nCouncil of Young Israel, with<br />\nthe JSA as a campus sponsw.<br />\nAs an Orthodox Jewish group,<br />\nYoung Israel maintains religious standards which enable<br />\nconcerned students to properly<br />\nobserve their faith.

In the<br />\nOctober 29 News-Letter, the<br />\ncharges brought against the<br />\nPSU by SC are technical, superficial and irrevelant, of the type<br />\nthat all student organizations<br />\nmay be found guilty of scrutinized in the same way. Such<br />\ncharges seem to intend to cover<br />\nup the REAL REASONS for<br />\nwhich SC expressed so strongly the intent to \"decharter\" the<br />\nPSU (cf. News-Letter of October 22). The SC recommendation to decharter PSU was a<br />\ndirect response to the appeal by<br />\nthe JSA president and resulted<br />\nfrom the October 20 \"teach-in\"<br />\non the Middle East sponsored<br />\nby the PSU.<br />\nThe original grievances of<br />\nJSA against PSU stated clearly<br />\nthat the Jewish Student Association (which earlier had tried to<br />\ncancel another lecture by a proPalestinian guest sponsored by<br />\nthe Chaplain's office) objects to<br />\nthe very idea of any Palestinian<br />\nor pro-Palestinian guest or topic. JSA accused the speakers of<br />\nbeing sympathisers of the \"terrorist\" PLO, which could not<br />\naccept the fact that a pro-Israeli<br />\nspokesman was not included,<br />\nwere surprised and ANGRY<br />\nthat nonstudents were included<br />\nin the audience, etc. The logical<br />\nanswers to such claims should<br />\nbe obvious: According to the<br />\ndemocratic law of this country,<br />\nall individuals and groups have<br />\nthe right to free speech, including Jewish [sic] and Palestinians, Pro-Israelis and proPalestinians alike. No logic or<br />\nregulation makes it obligatory<br />\nor necessarily useful to include<br />\na pro-Israeli speaker in EVERY<br />\ndiscussion of the Middle East,<br />\nnor should EVERY event have<br />\nto take the form of a panel<br />\ndiscussion.

The eagerness<br />\nwith which the SC voted on October 20 to decharter the PSU<br />\nproves them rushed, immature<br />\nand partial against PSU. SC<br />\nPresident [sic) Mr. Davis went<br />\nso far as to threaten, in a dictatorial tone, that if SAC did<br />\nnot vote to decharter PSU, he<br />\nwould do so ON HIS OWN,<br />\nexercising some right given to<br />\nhim by the SC charter. If the<br />\nSC charter gives indeed the<br />\nright to any Mr. Davis to<br />\ndecharter any student organization because his political views<br />\ndiffer from those of that<br />\norganization, then the charter<br />\nitself should be subject to revision and improvement. In all<br />\nJSA and SC statements (cf.<br />\nNews-Letter October 22) an<br />\nanti-Palestinian and anti-PSU<br />\nbias prevailed, respectively.<br />\nThat is why we are concerned<br />\nthat in February, the final decision regarding PSU status, may<br />\n, be biased and resulting from<br />\npolitical rather than charterrelated considerations. The<br />\nthreat to \"decharter\" PSU<br />\nbecasue of JSA and SC disapproval of the guests of the October 20 meeting seems quite<br />\nreal. We maintain that the PSU<br />\nshould not be made to feel that<br />\nit owes any apologies for exercising their rights as an EQUAL<br />\nand legitimate student organization and for sponsoring an<br />\nevent of their choosing. Much<br />\nless should the PSU live under<br />\nthe threat of being voted OUT<br />\nOF EXISTENCE.

I'll try to make<br />\nthis short.\"<br />\n\"Please do.\"<br />\nOf course, he didn't.- He<br />\nspoke about a new SAC constitution that he had typed, correlated and distributed. And<br />\nwhen he was talking, everyone<br />\nelse was either laughing with<br />\nJim or reading the financial section of USA Today, as JSA<br />\nPresident Seth Kaye and Col-<br /><br />\nlege Republican President Brian<br />\nMirsky were doing.

The main problem<br />\nthat exists here is that the<br />\nchecks and balances between<br />\nthe SAC and Student Council<br />\nhave been rendered contradictory.

And allow me to say<br />\nthat these comments are mine<br />\nand not those of the constitutional committee.\"<br />\nJim sat down and proceeded<br />\nto chain-smoke the rest of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\n\"The chair recognizes Wayne<br />\nKimball.\"<br />\n\"A point of information<br />\nhere. Am I to understand ...\"<br />\nThank you, Wayne. I have<br />\nno idea what he said after that.<br />\n\"The chair recognizes Mr.<br />\nSalles again.\"<br />\nHe responded to whatever<br />\nWayne said, and then all of a<br />\nsudden he suggested that a\u2022Second Annual Debby Jeffrey<br />\nConstitutional Amendment be<br />\nvoted on. But Harry, as he<br />\nalways does, had a quick reply.<br />\n\"Why don't we not and<br />\ncontinue.\"<br />\nJim digressed once again, sat<br />\ndo\u2018\u2018 n again, but didn't light<br />\nanother cigarette until Wayne<br />\nasked to be recognized again.<br />\nHarry then asked Wayne to address the meeting up front at<br />\nthe podium.<br />\n\"I am ashamed to be a part<br />\nof this constitution.

Sophomore Paul Stader<br />\nacknowledges the role his scholarship<br />\nplayed in his decision to join ROTC,.<br />\nsaying frankly that it would be \"impossible for me to go to Hopkins<br />\nwithout my scholarship.\" Another<br />\ncadet sees it as a reciprocal relationship. \"The Army gets what it<br />\nwants--officers\u2014and I get a chance<br />\nto go to the school I want to.\" Of the<br />\nestimated 45 Hopkins students currently enrolled in the program, which<br />\ndraws people from other area schools<br />\nlike UMBC, Goucher and Towson,<br />\n37 are now on scholarships.<br />\nA second reason given by several\u2022<br />\nfor joining ROTC was activicadets<br />\na<br />\nty.

Most cadets will<br />\nopt for that special branch of the ser-<br /><br />\nvice that corresponds to their field of<br />\ninterest, like engineering or law. Says<br />\nMessick, \"My IR (International<br />\nRelations) major won't exactly be<br />\nbankable.\" He added that ROTC is<br />\nmore a ticket to a job, preferably in<br />\nhis case, in military intelligence, than<br />\nan opportunity for him to learn to<br />\nlead troops into combat.

Included in this additional<br />\nspace are galleries, a lecture room, a<br />\nclassroom, a members' room, a cafe<br />\nthat overlooks the sculpture garden, and<br />\na 400-seat auditorium.<br />\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that the<br />\nmuseum now has the opportunity to<br />\nopen part of its building for events in<br />\nthe evening; with the facilities of the new<br />\nwing, the entire structure need not be<br />\nopened, and the large costs associated<br />\nwith more security guards are eliminated. Among the evening activities now<br />\nheld in the museum are the Thursday<br />\nscreenings of the Baltimore Film Forum.<br />\nHarper emphasized that the architects<br />\nof the new wing paid special attention<br />\nto the functions of the wing while incorporating it into the original structure.<br />\nAmong the building's new features are<br />\na terrace that looks out onto the park<br />\nin front of the museum, and the creation, on the lower floor, of a new eastwest axis of galleries and open space.<br />\nThe collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art covers a wide range of<br />\ntastes. The fact that nearly every type of<br />\nart is represented means that the casual<br />\nobserver, as well as the diehard enthusiast, can be satisfied. Among its<br />\nparticularly strong assemblages of art is<br />\nthe Cone Collection of primarily French<br /><br />\nUpdike:<br />\nBech<br />\nRedux<br />\nC'011f. from p. 15<br /><br />\nThe New Museum Cafe looks out on the sculpture garden.<br /><br />\npaintings and sculpture of the early<br />\ntwentieth century. Included within this<br />\ncollection are 42 oils and 18 sculptures<br />\nby Henri Matisse, and numerous other<br />\nworks by Picasso, Cezanne and Monet.<br />\nIt is difficult to imagine a room 50 feet<br />\nby about 50 feet entirely filled with<br />\nworks by Matisse, but the museum indeed contains such a room.<br />\nIf your tastes are to the slightly less<br />\nextreme, there are works by Van Gogh,<br />\nDegas, Renoir and Gauguin. For those<br />\ninterested in modern art, there are works<br />\nby Andy Warhol and a soon-arriving exhibition of neon light work by Bruce<br />\nNowman. Another \"must\" is the display of posters and lithographs by<br />\nToulouse-Lautrec.<br />\nThere is also the Old Masters gallery,<br />\nwith works by Rembrandt, Raphael,<br />\nand many others. If you prefer American painters, you can see Benjamin<br />\nWest's self-portrait, the works of<br /><br />\nThomas Hart Benton, and Winslow<br />\n: Homer's paintings. Among many other<br />\ninteresting items are a stained-glass window by Louis Tiffany that is about 3<br />\nfeet wide and 12 feet tall, an early<br />\nbronze casting of Rodin's Thinker that<br />\nis about eight feet tall, and numerous<br />\nAntioch mosaics from the fifth to the<br />\neighth centuries A.D. There are galleries<br />\ndevoted to sporting art; the art of<br />\nAfrica, the Americas and Oceania; the<br />\nEuropean and American decorative arts;<br />\nand the special exhibition of Imperial<br />\ncostumes of the Manchu Dynasty.<br />\nBut so much said for pieces of art; the<br />\nbest way to experience the new layout<br />\nis to visit it.

The structure is partially responsible for this; since it isn't<br />\na novel but a collection of pieces, the<br />\nbook is unable to create a cumulative effect, and since none of the episodes are<br />\ntrue short stories, the impact of each is<br />\nno greater than the sum of its individual<br />\nmoments.<br />\nEarly on in the narrative Updike says:<br />\n\"Great books begin with tiny hints ...<br />\nand Bech had begun his messy accumulation of pages with little more<br />\nthan a hum, a hum that ... was, it' not<br />\nthe meaning of life, the tenor of meaninglessness in our late-twentieth-century,<br />\npost-numinous, industrial-consumeristic<br />\ncivilization, North American branch,<br />\nMiddle Atlantic subdivision.\" That hum<br />\ncan also be heard, faintly, throughout<br />\nBech is Back, but to the reader's loss,<br />\nUpdike never attempts to raise its<br />\nvolume.<br /><br />\nThe Placement Bureau<br />\nInterview Schedule<br />\nManTech International<br />\nRutgers Graduate School of Business<br />\nZeger-Abrams<br />\nSignal Science<br />\nPace University Graduate School of Business<br /><br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS:<br /><br />\nNaval Surface Weapons Center<br />\nNavy Nuclear Power Program<br />\nAlbuquerque Public Schools<br /><br />\n11/17.<br /><br />\nGTE-Sylvania<br />\nGoddard Space Flight Center<br />\nSignal Science<br />\nGeorgetown Graduate School of Business<br />\n11/19.<br /><br />\nConDiesel Mobile Equipment Group<br />\nBendix Field Engineering (rescheduled)<br /><br />\n11/29.<br /><br />\nLitton A mecom<br />\nTufts-Fletcher School of Lass and Diplomacy<br /><br />\n11/30.<br /><br />\nI.utron Electronics<br />\nMIT Sloan<br /><br />\ncome to the Placement Bureau, in the<br />\n*If interested in an of the above.

That was during a \"flag\"<br />\nfootball game.<br />\nDuring the just completed<br />\n13IA football season, in which<br />\nMedical Nemesis defeated the<br />\nDestroyers 31-13 for the championship, there were many injuries, though most were not as<br /><br />\nIntense practice<br /><br />\nThe next ECCKU 'tournament will be held at Johns<br />\nHopkins on Saturday, November 20 from 1-3 p.m. in the<br />\nAuxiliary Gym. The JHU Karate<br />\nClub is training hard to make<br />\ngood next Saturday, and invites<br />\neveryone to attend what should<br />\nprove to be an exciting battle.<br /><br />\nserious as Blum's. The other<br />\nmajor injuries were a broken<br />\nwrist, suffered by a freshman<br />\nfrom Clark House, and a broken arm, suffered by a freshman<br />\nin Griffin. These are in addition<br />\nto the many other bumps and<br />\nbruises incurred by BIA football participants.<br />\nAccording to BIA board<br />\nmember Robert Zeldin, the<br />\nboard has come up with two<br />\nnew rules to help eliminate<br />\nmany injuries. Zeldin said that<br />\n\"referees have been ordered to:<br />\n1) throw players out of the<br />\ngame for unnecessary roughness, and 2) forfeit the game if<br />\none team continues to be excessively violent.\" While these<br />\nrules may help eliminate intentional injuries, they do not<br />\ncombat the problem of accidental injuries, such as Blum's.<br />\nWhile the Executive Board<br /><br />\nAlthough the conference<br />\nseason is still two months away,<br />\nBlue Jay fencing has been active and bouting in several<br />\nUSIA and other area tournaments. On October 30, the<br />\nJays went to Washington, D.C.,<br />\nfor the Washington Fencers'<br />\nCollegiate Open. In a way,<br />\nHopkins dominated the event;<br />\nafter all, the squad made up<br />\nmost of the field. In the epee<br />\nevent, epee captain Roger Blauvelt, last year's MACFA epee<br />\ngold medalist, took first place,<br />\nwith Tim Cook, Rich Barrans,<br />\nCurt Carpenter and Pat Havens<br />\nsweeping third through sixth<br />\nplaces, respectively. (The top<br />\nsix fencers were designated<br />\nFinalists.) The foil event saw<br />\nfoil captain John Tu, David<br /><br />\nWeiner, and Toby Chai in second, third and sixth places.<br />\nHopkins was least successful in<br />\nthe sabre event, but still placed<br />\nthree finalists; Taro Adachi,<br />\nJohn Lee, and Mark Pritt<br />\nclaimed the fourth through<br />\nsixth slots. Originally, there was<br />\na three-way tie for third place,<br />\nbut it was broken, with Alajandro Luque from Morgan State<br />\ntaking the third slot.<br />\nThe following weekend, five<br />\nJay swordsmen (Tu,'Wiener,<br />\nGoldberg, Adachi, and Blauvert )\u2022 traveled up to \u2022 Philadelphia to participate in the<br />\nTemple Collegiate Open.

As exciting as this may sound, the<br />\nrace will probably be anticlimactic compared to last<br />\nweekend's MAC championships,<br />\nheld on the above course. In<br />\ngeneral, the MACs are more<br />\nmeaningful because competition is among Division III<br />\nschools and it is the only opportunity for the team to gauge accurately its performance in the<br />\nconference, considering the<br />\nharriers raced only four MAC<br />\nschools during the season. Unlike last year, when two outstanding performances saved<br />\nthe team from embarrassment,<br />\nthis year's team ran cohesively<br />\nand it was the result of a concentrated team effort that Hopkins placed a very respectable<br />\nseventh out of 17 teams represented. Senior rookie Kathy<br />\nConnally had her best race of<br />\nthe season after being hindered<br />\nby a pulled muscle. She traversed the 5K course in 20:40, and<br />\npaced Hopkins with her 26th<br />\nplace finish. Also scoring for<br />\nHopkins were Janice Brill<br />\n(20:52), Jackie Chen (21:03),<br />\nKaren Gressmir (21:19) and<br />\nTami Oki (21:35), who all<br />\nfinished within one minute of<br />\nConnally.
