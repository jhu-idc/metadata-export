At this meeting Prof.<br />\nJ. J.

The suggestion has<br />\nbeen made that the course be<br />\ntaught to the upper-classmen also,<br />\nas it is conceivably possible that<br />\nsome of them might be able to assimilate a small amount of additional knowledge.<br />\nThe course is an entirely new<br />\nthing in American pedagogy, and<br />\nif Hopkins adopts it, it will be<br />\nthe second university in the<br />\nUnited States to establish such a<br />\ncourse. The course was started at<br />\nColumbia last year, and has<br />\nproved very efficient in giving the<br />\nstudents a broad general knowledge of the world in which they<br />\nlive. Dr. Lovejoy states that the<br />\ncourse will cover a wide range of<br />\nsubjects, such a\u00a7 history, geography, commerce, politics, religion,<br />\neducation, races, arts and other<br />\npertinent information about the<br />\nvarious nations of the world. \"It<br />\nWill be in no sense a historicalgeographical dissertation,\" said<br />\nDr. Lovejoy, \"but will give the<br />\nstudent an excellent ,general insight into the modern world.\"<br />\n<br />\nFIELD CLUB.<br />\n<br />\nIt has been announced that Edward Speaker will talk before the<br />\nHopkins Field Club at its meeting today in Room 10, Gilman<br />\nHall.

At this meeting Prof.<br />\nJ. J. Coss of Columbia University<br />\naddressed the board on the subject of the new study, which\u2022 has<br />\nbeen taught at Columbia during<br />\nthe past year, and apparently the<br />\nboard is favorably inclined<br />\ntoward the establishment of the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Arthur 0.<br />\nLovejoy, professor of philosophy,<br />\nthe course will be one which apparently teaches the Freshman a<br />\nlittle of everything, which will obviously be a very valuable addition to the list of courses now<br />\ntaught here. The suggestion has<br />\nbeen made that the course be<br />\ntaught to the upper-classmen also,<br />\nas it is conceivably possible that<br />\nsome of them might be able to assimilate a small amount of additional knowledge.<br />\nThe course is an entirely new<br />\nthing in American pedagogy, and<br />\nif Hopkins adopts it, it will be<br />\nthe second university in the<br />\nUnited States to establish such a<br />\ncourse. The course was started at<br />\nColumbia last year, and has<br />\nproved very efficient in giving the<br />\nstudents a broad general knowledge of the world in which they<br />\nlive. Dr. Lovejoy states that the<br />\ncourse will cover a wide range of<br />\nsubjects, such a\u00a7 history, geography, commerce, politics, religion,<br />\neducation, races, arts and other<br />\npertinent information about the<br />\nvarious nations of the world. \"It<br />\nWill be in no sense a historicalgeographical dissertation,\" said<br />\nDr. Lovejoy, \"but will give the<br />\nstudent an excellent ,general insight into the modern world.\"<br /><br />\nFIELD CLUB.<br /><br />\nIt has been announced that Edward Speaker will talk before the<br />\nHopkins Field Club at its meeting today in Room 10, Gilman<br />\nHall.

He left some<br />\nsubscription blanks which he requested when filled to be put in<br />\nP. 0. Box 388. The dues of the<br />\nclub are $10 a year.<br />\nThe class then voted that the<br />\nbudget which is being prepared by<br />\nMr. Bascom Kennady and T.
