Networks<br />\nhave increasingly turned to producing special, \"one shot\" TV<br />\nevents such as miniseries.<br />\nCable has also siphoned off<br />\na small element of the highly<br />\neducated and affluent television<br />\naudience with its cultural programming, as well as teenagers<br />\nwith programming like MTV.<br />\nThis situation leaves networks<br />\nconcentrating their programs<br />\non the mass audience.<br />\nCarter said he finds other<br />\nfacets of technology less important to the medium. He thinks<br />\nthe home computer boom is essentially a fad and, while it can<br />\nserve valuable purposes for<br />\n<br />\nsome, the overall population<br />\nwil tire of using its screen for<br />\ndiversion much as the young<br />\npeople have tired of video<br />\ngames recently.<br />\nThe second segment of television, information, is what<br />\nCarter said he thinks will keep<br />\nthe networks from bowing to<br />\ncable's power.<br />\n\"News programs are a huge<br />\ninformational tool\u2014network<br />\nTV can survive as long as their<br />\nnews is the best,\" said Carter.<br />\n\"Handheld cameras have made<br />\nit possible for the entire nation<br />\nto be witnesses to events like<br />\nassassinations. We expect newspeople to be there.\"<br />\nCarter said that overall, TV<br />\nnews is very professional, but<br />\nthat accuracy can be a problem.<br />\nThe pressure for a channel to be<br />\nfirst with a breaking story keeps<br />\nreporters from waiting to check<br />\nfacts, and false information<br />\nsometimes results.<br />\nCarter spoke tolerantly of the<br />\nthird area of TV programming,<br />\nentertainment. He states there<br />\nhas been bad TV entertainment<br />\nthroughout the medium's 30year history and it is not<br />\nprimarily a recent problem.<br />\nMindless situation comedies<br />\nand game shows are developed<br />\nto satisfy the typical TV consumer, and Carter thinks the<br />\ndemand for shows is not always<br />\naccurately determined,<br />\nThe famous Nielsen ratings<br />\nare conducted by some 1200<br />\n\"Nielsen families,\" a cross section of the American public. A<br />\n<br />\nmechanical monitor records<br />\nwhat time the television set is on<br />\nand which station is watched;<br />\nwho the person watching is,<br />\nwhether he or she actually likes<br />\nthe program, and whether anyone is in the room watching at<br />\nall is not recorded.<br />\nThe most perfect form of TV<br />\nentertainment is sports, said<br />\nCarter.<br />\n\"They are always done well,<br />\nand are entertaining as well as<br />\ndiverting. And diversion serves<br />\nas useful purpose when not<br />\ndone in excess.\"<br />\nThe bottom line in television,<br />\n<br />\nCarter said, is money.<br />\n\"I think money rules TV<br />\nfrom top to bottom, and this<br />\nincludes public TV, which has<br />\nto bow and scrape for it,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe said the critic has little<br />\npower over the networks, for<br />\ncriticism has never dislodged a<br />\nhit show from the top. A faltering show, however, can gain<br />\nstrength from supportive criticism; he cites one of his favorite<br />\nshows, Hill Street Blues, as an<br />\nexample of a show kept on for<br />\nits good reviews which gradually captured a loyal following.<br />\n<br />\nMuller Says<br />\nUnlikely<br />\nTeach<br />\nHe'll<br />\ncont from p.

It told<br />\nof a \"significant increase in the level of<br />\ncriminal activity on and around the<br />\nHomewood Campus\" during the summer<br />\nmonths.<br />\nThe memorandum cited assaults on<br />\nwomen in the areas of San Martin Drive, the<br />\nWest Campus, and Wyman Park, and a<br />\nsubstantial increase in the number of thefts<br />\non campus.<br />\n\"There were three incidents of assaults on<br />\nwomen during the summer,\" Bowie told the<br />\nNews-Letter at the time. \"Fortunately, none<br />\nof the women were associated with Hopkins,<br />\nbut the assaults did occur in this area, and<br />\nwe feel we have a responsibility to the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins community was infdrmed,<br />\neither by word of mouth or by reading the<br />\nNews-Letter. But was any action taken? According to Bowie, security in the three areas<br />\nwas increased, and the Northern District of<br />\nthe Baltimore Police offered their full<br />\ncooperation.<br />\nAugust 10, 1983. A female student was<br />\nraped while waiting for a ride along San<br />\nMartin Drive. According to Robert Larkin,<br />\nmanager of the Campus Security Office, it<br />\n<br />\nwas the first rape on the Homewood campus in two years.<br />\nOctober 6, 1983. A female graduate student from the Evening College was attacked while walking toward the parking lot near<br />\nMerryman Hall.<br />\nLast week, Larkin said,\"We are twentythree strong, and I believe we have adequate<br />\nsecurity.\"<br />\nNonsense. At night, security officers are<br />\nseldom seen near the dormitories. Seldom<br />\nseen walking on campus. Seldom seen doing anything, except driving their patrol cars<br />\non the streets of Baltimore or drinking coffee at WAWA.<br />\nWednesday night, Student Council passed a resolution to form a safety committee<br />\nconsisting of students and administrators.<br />\nWhat they must do is...<br />\n... remove foliage in secluded areas.<br />\n... install more lights on campus.<br />\n... see whether Larkin is telling the truth.<br />\nand most important, inform students<br />\nof the situation because campus security isn't<br />\ntotally at fault.<br />\nUnfortunately, students associated with<br />\nHopkins have been assaulted. And<br />\nsomething has to be done. Now.

NATO has<br />\nno land based missiles capable<br />\nof reaching the Soviet Union<br />\nbut it does have shorter range<br />\nsystems for use against Eastern<br />\nEurope and tactical weapons<br />\nfor battlefield use.<br />\n<br />\nSecond, the approximately<br />\n500 Soviet theater missiles<br />\ndesigned for use in Europe are<br />\nnot based in Eastern Europe(as<br />\nstated in the article) but in the<br />\nSoviet Union.<br />\nThird, President Reagan's<br />\nUN speech proposed that the<br />\nUnited States would not match<br />\nthe entire Soviet Asian and<br />\nEuropean Theater deployment<br />\nof missiles with American<br />\nmissiles in Europe\u2014not as the<br />\narticle stated, \"the U.S. would<br />\nmatch SS-20's with the number<br />\nof missiles of Britain and<br />\nFrance.\"<br />\nFourth, the major reason the<br />\nUnited States has rejected the<br />\nSoviet proposal to reduce<br />\nSoviet missile numbers tn the<br />\nFrench and British levels is that<br />\nthe United States (along with<br />\nthe governments of Britain and<br />\nFrance) view the British and<br />\nFrench nuclear arms as a<br />\nminimal deterrent for those<br />\ncountries and not part of the<br />\ndefense of Western Europe.<br />\nFifth, it should be made clear<br />\nthat I am not happy with the<br />\nneed to deploy long range<br />\nnuclear weapons in Europe. I<br />\nhope that once it is demonstrated that NATO has the will<br />\nand capability to match the<br />\nSoviet SS-20 threat, either an<br />\narms control solution could be<br />\nworked out or Europe would<br />\nrely more on (increased) conventional defenses to deter the<br />\nSoviet Union.<br />\nThere are other points I<br />\nwould like to clarify but in the<br />\ninterests of space will stop here.<br />\nThis is obviously a complex<br />\nissve alc,11,5yrnpat,bize wit11 the<br />\n<br />\nefforts of your reporter and<br />\neditor to summarize confusing<br />\nideas in a short article. Nevertheless, in the future I would<br />\nhope that you take more care in<br />\nreporting the views of speakers.<br />\nSincerely<br />\nSteven R. David<br />\nAssistant Professor<br />\nThe U.S. and Nicaragua<br />\n-To the Editor:<br />\nThe Reagan Administration<br />\nclaims that Nicaragua is a<br />\nclosed totalitarian society and a<br />\nSoviet-Cuban puppet responsible for much of the violence in<br />\nCentral America. On the other<br />\nhand, supporters of the Nicaraguan revolution maintain that<br />\nthere has been significant improvements in the health,<br />\neducation, and welfare of the<br />\nmajority of Nicaraguans, that<br />\na creative form of democracy is<br />\nalready unfolding through grass<br />\nroots organizations, and that<br />\nthe biggest problem is the U.S.<br />\nsupport for the Contros who<br />\nseek to overthrow the popular<br />\nSandinista led government.<br />\nWho is telling us the truth<br />\nabout Nicaragua?<br />\nThis winter people from<br />\nBaltimore and the rest of the<br />\nU.S. will have the opportunity to<br />\nsee for themsleves and form<br />\ntheir own opinions about this<br />\ncountry whose future has<br />\nbecome a major question of<br />\nU.S. foreign policy.<br />\nCentral American<br />\nSolidarity Committee<br />\n<br />\nAs a responsible adult, I take<br />\noffense to your article of October 4, 1983 \"Keep Your<br />\nDoors Locked.\" This article, in<br />\nthe vein of the recent slash and<br />\nmaul movies has no place in a<br />\nnewspaper.<br />\nFirstly, the article preys upon<br />\nemotions of fear and terror by<br />\nusing scare tactics. In style,<br />\ntone, and content, it resembles<br />\ngruesome tales told to keep<br />\nchildren in line, a la the Bogey<br />\nman.<br />\nSecondly, the article is condescending. All members of the<br />\nHopkins community are legal<br />\nadults, except in some rare case.<br />\nBeing adults in college, graduate school students, and teaching faculty, the community of<br />\nreaders has a healthy respect for<br />\ntheir lives and for their safety.<br />\nThis piece strips every NewsLetter reader of their maturity<br />\nand berates their common<br />\nsense.<br />\nFinally, this article is slanted<br />\ntowards the female population<br />\nat Hopkins. The two \"stories\"<br />\ntold are vague on details but exact as to the sex of those involved. The only proper unisex<br />\nreference occurs almost at the<br />\nvery end of the article when the<br />\npronoun \"he\" is utilized. This<br />\npiece is a direct response to the<br />\nattack on the female Hopkins<br />\ngraduate student; however, in<br />\nits form it offers no concrete<br />\nsuggestions and is therefore of<br />\nlittle use.<br />\nThis article is an insulting<br />\npublic service scare story for<br />\nfemales. It is my opinion that<br />\narticles of this nature be confined to the campfire.<br />\n<br />\nhe certainly makes me wonder<br />\nwhat he meant by it.<br />\nI'd like to believe he meant<br />\nthat the Homewood campus,<br />\nurban as it is, is impossible to<br />\nrender completely safe: crime<br />\ncan be reduced but never done<br />\naway with. But he could just as<br />\neasily have meant that tne two<br />\nattempted rapes this fall (one of<br />\nwhich was successful) were excusable and can be dismissed as<br />\nsuch\u2014\"because crime can<br />\nnever be eradicated, why try?\"<br />\nIt's possible that Mr. Larkin<br />\nhas just this sort of lackadaisical attitude about campus security, poorly disguised as an<br />\ninterest for law and order. But<br />\nwouldn't the University pick up<br />\non that? If this were the case,<br />\nmost would doubt that he<br />\nwould still be around.<br />\nThe better possibility is that<br />\nMr. Larkin simply is afflicted<br />\nwith an inability to express exactly what he wants to say. It's<br />\nlikely that this is the case: this<br />\nfaux pas is much like one he<br />\nmade September 2 while addressing this year's freshman<br />\nadvisors, when he said that only one rape had occurred this<br />\nfall. After the crowd's reaction<br />\nto his gaffe, he quickly added<br />\nthat it was the first rape in two<br />\nyears. He should add a similar<br />\nclarification to his latest comments, or he should find some<br />\nother line of work.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\nHal Brunette<br />\nGrad Club Problems<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nAs everyone is well aware,<br />\nthe State of Maryland has raised the legal drinking ageato 21.<br />\nThis poses a number of problems for many campus activities, and particuarly the Grad<br />\nSincerely Club which has always been a<br />\nLisa M.

Peptides are short polymers (3-60 units) of amino<br />\nacids, the buildings blocks of<br />\nproteins. These small molecules<br />\nhad been dismissed as products<br />\nof protein degradation, rather<br />\nthan as a necessary link in the<br />\nchain of hormonal regulation<br />\nof the body's activities. Much<br />\nmedical research has been<br />\nfocused upon the effects of<br />\nneuropeptides, and the possibilities for their clinical use are<br />\nstartling. Russell W. Pelham,<br />\nthe Director of Pharmaceutical<br />\nResearch at Sereno Laboratories in Randolph, Massachusetts, speculates that \"within<br />\nthe next decade or two, they<br />\ncould become even more widely used than antibiotics.\"<br />\nFuture applications may include treatments for infertility,<br />\ncancer, ulcers, and immune<br />\ndeficiencies, in addition to playing an important new role in<br />\nbirth control for both men and<br />\nwomen.<br />\nThe hypothalamus is a region<br />\nof the brain under particularly<br />\nintense scrutiny. It appears to<br />\nbe the single most important<br />\ncontrol center for regulation of<br />\nthe internal environment, as<br />\nwell as an area associated with<br />\nthe expression of emotion.

Prolactin (PRL) is also<br />\nreleased by the anterior<br />\npituitary and promotes milk<br />\nproduction and secretion in the<br />\nmammary glands. Thyroid<br />\nstimulating hormone (TSH)<br />\nboth stimulates and maintains<br />\nmetabolic activities and inhibits<br />\nthe release of calcium from<br />\n.bone tissue. Both oxytocin and<br />\nvasopressin are secreted in the<br />\nhypothalamus, and travel to the<br />\npituitary gland for storage and<br />\nrelease into the peripheral circulation. Oxytocin stimulates<br />\nuterine contractions and the<br />\nrelease of milk, while vasopression (antidiuretic hormone)<br />\ncontrols water retention and excretion in the kidneys.<br />\nFollicle stimulating hormone<br />\n(FSH)and leutinizing hormone<br />\n(LH)are largely responsible for<br />\nthe hormonal maintenance and<br />\nstimulation of the testes and<br />\novaries, and the functions of<br />\nsperm and egg production.<br />\nLeutinizing hormone, in particular, controls the secretion of<br />\nthe steroids responsible for the<br />\nmale and female secondary sexual characteristics, and also<br />\nstimulates ovulation. Leutinizing hormone releasing hormone<br />\n(L11RH) is produced in the<br />\nhypothalamus and was shown<br />\nin 1971 to be a polypeptide<br />\ncomposed of ten amino acids,<br />\nand responsible for the release<br />\nof both CH and FSH from the<br />\n<br />\nFig. I.

The<br />\nmethod entails deeply anesthetizing the animals, perfusing<br />\ntheir brains with acrolein, and<br />\nremoving the organ. The hypothalamus was then sectioned to<br />\n50 microns thickness on a<br />\nVibratome in preparation for<br />\nthe analysis. The tissue was exposed to a pre-treatment regimen to remove the fixative<br />\nprior to the actual immunocytochemistry.<br />\nImmonocytochemistry simply involes the combination of<br />\nchemistry and immunology to<br />\nstudy the properties of cells in<br />\na particular tissue. The basic<br />\npremise behind immunology<br />\nstates that antibodies are extremely specific and are generated to recognize and bind to the<br />\ninvading \"body\". Once the<br />\n3ntibody-antigen couple is<br />\n:ormed, the invading particle is<br />\ninactivated or destroyed. In the<br />\nimmunocytochemistry lab,<br />\nseveral different types of<br />\nantibody-containing anti-sera<br />\nare t tilized to bind to the cells<br />\nof tl-e hypothalamus that produce LHRH, and then color<br />\nthese sites through chemical<br />\nreactions. In this manner, the<br />\nreactive cells can be studied<br />\nwith the light and electron<br />\nmicroscopes.<br />\nA technique described by<br />\nLudwig A. Sternbereer in 1974<br />\nis used in Dr. King's laboratory<br />\nto localize LHRH fibers. This<br />\ntechnique involves the application of a specific primary antiserum that was produced in<br />\na rabbit against synthetic<br />\nLHRH. A secondary antiserum that is produced in sheep<br />\nagainst the rabbit anti-serum<br />\nis applied in excess to the<br />\nbrain tissue. The third step<br />\ninvolves the use of an antiperoxidase that was purified<br />\nfrom antiserum produced in the<br />\nrabbit. In step four, a peroxidase is applied which binds to<br />\nthe antiperioxidase of step<br />\nthree. Next, peroxide and the<br />\ncompound diamonobenzidine<br />\n(DAB) are added. Peroxide is<br />\nthe substrate of the enzyme<br />\nperoxidase, and when these two<br />\ncompounds react, an electron<br />\ntransfer reaction occurs. The<br />\nelectrons are transferred to<br />\nDAB,causing it to turn brown.<br />\nIn the last step of this process,<br />\nthis complex is reacted with<br />\nosmium tetroxide to form an<br />\ninsoluble structure that is black<br />\nfor light microscopy and opaque for electron microscopy.<br />\nIn the PAP (peroxidaseantiperoxidase) technique of<br />\nSternberger, the PAP complex<br />\nis preformed and Ynore convenient to apply.

Analogs of these<br />\nneuropeptides can also be<br />\nmanufactured such that substitutions or deletions are made at<br />\none or more positions on the<br />\nchain. These analogs fall into<br />\nthree categories, depending on<br />\nthe place at which LHRH was<br />\nmodified. They are agonists<br />\nwhich have as much or more<br />\nactivity; Antagonists, which<br />\nblock the activity of the original<br />\nhormone; and superagonists<br />\nwhich are so highly active that<br />\nthey behave as antagonists by<br />\n\"shorting out\" the pituitary's<br />\n<br />\nPaul Brunette<br />\n<br />\nSan Diego, appears to decrease<br />\nthe duration of the second half<br />\nof menstruation, preventing the<br />\nfertilized egg's implantation on<br />\nthe uterine wall.

One creature<br />\ncomfort, however, that does all<br />\ntoo frequently manifest itself in<br />\nthe domiciles of students is the<br />\nroach.<br />\nPerhaps cockroaches are attracted to students by the less<br />\nthan sterile and hygienic surroundings that seem to be an integral part of college life, or<br />\nmaybe, being nocturnal, they<br />\nlike the night life. Whatever the<br />\ncause, if their numbers are in<br />\nany wayindicative of their sentiments about roommates,<br />\nroaches seem to find cohabitation with college students a particularly desirable experience.<br />\nJohn, a JHU senior who for<br />\nobvious reasons wished to keep<br />\nhis full name confidential, candidly described what is probably not an altogether uncommon situation for many Hopkins students. \"In our apartment we have seven cockroach<br />\nhotels, and there's never any<br />\nvacancy. We've got thousands<br />\nof them.\"<br />\nWhile John's roach situation<br />\nmay be slightly worse than the<br />\nnorm, the uncontestable fact<br />\nremains that roaches are a big<br />\nproblem for students. In fact,<br />\naccording to Jim Porter, an entomologist from Baltimore and<br />\n<br />\na member of the American<br />\nRegistry of Professional Entomologists, the average apartment in Baltimore contains at<br />\nleast twelve of the pesky insects.<br />\nHowever, few people realize the<br />\npotential health hazard of these<br />\npests.<br />\nLike many other household<br />\npests, roaches deposit their excrements almost constantly onto just about everything, and<br />\nthey pick up bacteria and<br />\nviruses from whatever they<br />\nhappen to be crawling over. In<br />\njust one pass over a bacteria<br />\nsample, a roach can pick up<br />\nnearly 13,470 bacteria, according to Porter. No wonder they<br />\nare partially responsible for the<br />\nspread of allergies, typhoid,<br />\nleprosy, plague, food poisoning, polio, parasitic worms, and<br />\na host of other illnesses.<br />\nWhile there are some 3,500<br />\nknown species of cockroaches,<br />\nand possibly as many more<br />\nunidentified species, only four<br />\nmajor species find Baltimore's<br />\nclimate sufficiently appealing to<br />\nlive here year round. These four<br />\nspecies are the Oriental, American, German, and Brown-banded varieties. They range in size<br />\nfrom half an inch for the German to two inches in the case<br />\nof the American.<br />\nNormally, roaches are omnivorous; they eat everything a<br />\nhuman eats and a lot more.<br />\nMost pest roaches, however,<br />\nseem to have a special affinity<br />\n<br />\nfor starchy and sugary foods, cockroaches is about 20 to 30<br />\nbut they have been known to days.

Only after the insect is<br />\ncertain that the morsel contains<br />\nno poisons will it actually eat<br />\nthe food. Amazingly, a roach<br />\ncan live without food for three<br />\nmonths, and without food and<br />\nwater for one.<br />\nPerhaps as a result of their<br />\ncare in thoroughly checking<br />\ntheir food, roaches have a surprisingly long natural lifespan,<br />\napproaching three years for<br />\nsome common domestic pests.<br />\nIn that time, a single pair of<br />\nroaches could conceivably produce several million descendants. As Porter indicated, the<br />\ngestation period for most<br />\n<br />\nlike the motor of a refrigerator.\"<br />\nFrequently, these groups of<br />\ncockroaches collectively migrate. Their migrations usually<br />\ncover only a short distance,<br />\nfrom one side of an apartment<br />\nbuilding to the other, for example. Such changes in the focus<br />\nof infestation make attempts to<br />\neliminate them particularly<br />\ndifficult.<br />\nUsually the. most effective<br />\nmethod of eliminating a roach<br />\nproblem is to have a dwelling<br />\nsprayed by a professional exterminator. Short of a professional extermination, however,<br />\n<br />\nthere is quite a range of steps an<br />\nindividual can take to ward off<br />\nthe pests.<br />\nMany students find roach<br />\ntraps of the \"Roach Motel\"<br />\ntype to be very effective.

Perhaps the best<br />\ncockroach control, though, is<br />\njust good sanitation and hygiene.<br />\nWhile cockroaches certainly<br />\nrank among the filthiest and<br />\nmost annoying breed of animals alive, their tenacity and<br />\nability to adapt themselves to<br />\nnew environments is nothing<br />\nless than admirable.

They<br />\nhave been drifting about the city for over sixty years now,<br />\nhaving originated in 1916 as the<br />\nfirst successful performers of<br />\navante garde one-act plays in<br />\nBaltimore. During their conception, the Little Theater<br />\nMovement had already caught<br />\non in many other cities nationwide, and Baltimore had a demand for such an endeavor.<br />\nThe Vagabond Theater is<br />\npresently located in Fell's Point<br />\non South Broadway. Because<br />\nthe theater is a good size and<br />\nbecause several desirable alterations in structure are feasible,<br />\nthis is where they intend to stay<br />\nindefinitely. Before moving to<br />\nFell's Point in 1973, they tried<br />\nworking in places ranging from<br />\na small theater in Mount Vernon, where the Depression<br />\ncaused them to sacrifice their<br />\nexperimentation in favor of<br />\ntried and true Broadway-type<br />\nhits, to a 900 seat auditorium at<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory during the 60's, which was a disaster. Its size was not conducive<br />\nto the successful revival of intimate experimental tradition.<br />\nThe audience to which the Vagabond Players has consistently<br />\ncatered is too specialized to<br />\nneed that much space. President Bruce Johnson is happy<br />\nabout their secure residence. He<br />\nsays, \"It was debilitating to be<br />\nmoving. It made it hard to gain<br />\na faithful audience. This place<br />\n(the Fell's Point location) was<br />\nscheduled to become part of a<br />\nhighway circumventing Balti-<br />\n<br />\nmore. When we first started using it, it was known as Corral's<br />\nBar, although it was then<br />\nowned by the city. What luck to<br />\nfall into this place\u2014it was a<br />\ndecrepidated, run-down, awful<br />\narea. We got the place for<br />\n$25,000 and it's now probably<br />\nworth $250,000.\"<br />\nThe city had to approve the<br />\nalterations which the Vagabonds made on their theater in<br />\norder to maintain the atmosphere of the historical<br />\ndistrict. They have fashioned<br />\nboth the exterior and the interior to look like a 19th century opera house: This reversion to the past would seem<br />\ncontrary to the theater's professed commitment to new<br />\nscript exposure, but both contribute to the culture of Baltimore and the celebration of<br />\nart, which is part of the company's purpose.<br />\nJohnson points out a cardboard miniature of what he<br />\nwants the Vagabond Theater to<br />\neventually look like. It models<br />\na second story for the stage so<br />\nthat their production options<br />\nwon't be so limited as well as<br />\nadditional seating.<br />\nAll decisions for the company are made by a twelve<br />\nmember board, headed by<br />\nBruce Johnson who has been<br />\npresident for fifteen years. He<br />\ndeals primarily with the directing and administration, preferring behind the scenes work to<br />\nacting. He did play the title role<br />\nin The Drunkard for eight<br />\nyears, though, before his involvement with the Vagabonds.<br />\nHe teaches in a middle school<br />\nfor a living, as the Vagabond<br />\nPlayers is an amateur oganization. He speaks highly of the<br />\ndevotion of the board, staff,<br />\nand actors who have put in<br />\nlarge chunks of time, effort,<br />\nand in the past, funds to improve the productions. \"Tom<br />\n<br />\nGrahn is in the box office 165 events, such as their Saturday<br />\nnights a year. Anna Granofsky morning writer's workshop that<br />\nis retired, but I still don't see is open to the public, and their<br />\nwhere she gets the time that she Summer Festival held in conputs in for the Board of Gover- junction with the Fell's Point<br />\nnors; she works hard for the ci- Theater, in which Baltimore<br />\nty as well. None of the actors playwrights give public readings<br />\nare paid, although they could of their current works. Audiprobably make it in pro tions for all plays are open.<br />\nJohnson assures, \"People say<br />\ntheater.\"<br />\nThe Vagabonds try to pull Vagabond is a clique, but that's<br />\ntogether different cultures flat out wrong\u2014we're looking<br />\nwithin the city through various for new blood.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe works that are picked<br />\neach season to be performed<br />\nare meant to reflect the changing styles and themes of today's<br />\nplaywrights, without ignoring<br />\nthe old. They work on a line<br />\nbetween mainstream entertainment and the more controversial new styles that may be considered offensive to the Vagabond's subscribers\u2014mainly a<br />\nsophisticated, middle-aged<br />\ncrowd. Says Johnson,\"We try<br />\nto be interesting and entertaining without being confronting\u2014a play should not assault<br />\nthe audience. We don't want to<br />\nbend entirely the other way<br />\neither, though. Rainmaker is<br />\nour only bow to commerical<br />\ntheater this year.\"<br />\nThe Vagabond Players' subscribers are becoming more<br />\nnumerous, and the board is<br />\nhappy with the theater's progress, but it sees a possibility of<br />\nproblems in the future. The<br />\ntheater is a major time commitment because there is a very<br />\nsmall core of people administrating for the company. Few<br />\nyoung people have voiced an interest in helping with administration. The Vagabond<br />\nPlayers' company hopes to find<br />\nsome younger people established in the Fell's Point area who<br />\nare willing to work with directing, managing, and administrating. There are times when<br />\nJohnson feels that movies and<br />\nkielvision have pre-empted not<br />\nonly the theater, but especially<br />\nthe little theater. \"We have a<br />\nlow profile,\" says Johnson,<br />\n\"but the attention we have<br />\ndrawn has been generally positive, and that reassures us that<br />\nwhat we are doing is worthwhile.\"<br />\nThis is the third in a series of<br />\narticles about theaters in the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br />\n<br />\n007 Is Back So Never Say Never Again<br />\nby Marianne Perrella<br />\nBond is back, and thank<br />\nGod, this time he's Sean Connery. Never Say Never Again,<br />\nwhile not the best of Connery's<br />\nBond films, is still vastly superior to some of the recent Roger<br />\nMoore duds like Moonraker<br />\nand For Your Eyes Only.<br />\nThis latest Bond adventure<br />\nbegins very differently from<br />\nany other of the series: an aging 007 is sent to a fitness camp<br />\nto get back into shape with vitamins, weightlifting, and herbal enemas. But this somewhat<br />\ndepressing focus on Bond's<br />\nostensibly faded condition is<br />\nsoon followed by a more satisfying return to typical 007<br />\nintrigues.<br />\nThere are some really exciting passages in this part of<br />\nthe film\u2014a motorcycle chase, a<br />\nlittle first-class waterskiing, and<br />\na rescue on horseback. Connery<br />\nis his usual sexy, humorous self.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nIn one notable scene, a bomb<br />\nblows up his bedroom; from<br />\nanother room he and a woman<br />\nwatch from her bed. \"I'm glad<br />\nwe picked your place,\" he tells<br />\nher without missing a beat.<br />\nThe other principal characters are, for the most part,<br />\nadeptly portrayed. Maria Brandauer is convincing as the babyfaced but vengeful villain who<br />\nblackmails the world with two<br />\nstolen American nuclear-armed<br />\ncruise missiles. Kim Basinger is<br />\nhum-drum as the woman-whoturns-traitor as a result of<br />\nBond's charm.<br />\nPossibly the best performance is given by Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush. Wrapping snakes around her neck,<br />\nbragging about her sexual<br />\nprowess, laughing about<br />\nmurder, or pointing a gun<br />\ndirectly at Bond's groin, she<br />\nplays the \"bad-guy\" with fiendish exuberance.<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br />\n<br />\n.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nBond, though older, is still his sexy, humorous self.<br />\n<br />\nWarner Bros<br />\n<br />\n\f12/OCTOBER 21, 1983<br />\n<br />\nIvory: The Sumptuous Art<br />\nby Mary Butler<br />\n<br />\nICE CREAM<br />\nPARLOUR<br />\n<br />\nOLD<br />\nFASHIONED<br />\n<br />\nFEATURING BARRICINI ICE CREAM<br />\nMAKE YOUR OWN SUNDAE & SPLIT<br />\nUNLIMITED TOPPING BAR<br />\nICE CREAM CAKES MADE TO ORDER<br />\nOPEN 7 DAYS<br />\n1 1 AM -12 MID<br />\n<br />\n345 E. 33rd St.<br />\n467-1014<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\n7777677-rR7777,17<br />\n<br />\nrE\"<br />\n<br />\nGET NEXT SUNDAE AT /<br />\n1<br />\n2 PRICE<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI<br />\n...<br />\nGOOD ON THIS VISIT OR NET<br />\n<br />\nYou Can Wear<br />\n<br />\nCONTACTS<br />\n<br />\nNew Technological Developments In Improved Eye Wear<br />\nNow Make Contact Lenses Available To Most Everyone<br />\n...1\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,<br />\n<br />\n15%<br />\nDISCOUNT<br />\nON CONCACT LENSES<br />\nAND FRAMES TO<br />\nSTUDENTS AND<br />\nFACULTY BODY<br />\nFree Consultation<br />\nAsk About Our Free<br />\n30 Day Trial Period<br />\n<br />\n\u2022Permalens you can wear two<br />\nweeks at a time<br />\n\u2022 Gas permeable, semi-soft<br />\nlenses<br />\n\u2022Bausch & Lomb Softcon Soft<br />\nLenses<br />\n\u2022Bi-Focal Jnd Ultra Thin Hard<br />\nLenses<br />\n<br />\nEye examinations<br />\nDaytime or Evening<br />\nBy Appointment.<br />\nGlaucoma Testing.<br />\n<br />\n243-8884<br />\nDR.

The show, Ivory:<br />\nThe Sumptuous Art, offers a<br />\ncomprehensive view of the<br />\nmaterial from 4500 BC to 1900<br />\nAD. Carvings in ivory represent<br />\nsome of man's earliest efforts<br />\nto form images and has remained a primary sculptural<br />\nmedium throughout western<br />\nhistory.<br />\nThe current collection was<br />\nput together almost entirely by<br />\nHenry Walters, who left his collection and gallery to Baltimore<br />\nin 1931. The Walters has one of<br />\nthe six largest collections in the<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe exhibit opens with pictures of ivory carvers and a<br />\ndisplay of the sources of ivory.<br />\nMost of this collection's ivory<br />\ncame from elephant tusks and<br />\nhippopotamus teeth. But the<br />\ntusks of many different animals<br />\nhave also been used since antiquity, including mammoths,<br />\nwalruses, narwhals, boar and<br />\nwarthogs. Ivory-like objects<br />\nwere made of bone and horn<br />\nwhen ivory was not available.<br />\nThe exhibit is arranged<br />\nchronologically, starting with<br />\nEgypt and the ancient Near<br />\nEast. Among the earliest pieces<br />\nin the show are a group of<br />\nanimals and human figures<br />\nmade of hippoptamus teeth<br />\nfrom ancient Egypt. These<br />\nsmall figures may have had<br />\nmagical purposes or perhaps<br />\nserved as game tokens (about<br />\n4500 BC). There are also cosmetic containers, one in the<br />\nshape of a duck, and a cosmetic<br />\nspoon whose handle is in the<br />\nshape of a servant.<br />\nSeveral important pieces of<br />\nthe show were recently acquired<br />\nfrom the Fortress at Nimrud in<br />\nAssyria (9th and 8th centuries<br />\nBC). One is a thick plaque that<br />\n'depicts a cow nursing a suckling<br />\nIcalf, carved in high relief.<br />\nAnother is a thin plaque carved<br />\nin low relief that shows a griffin against the stylized branches<br />\nof a sacred tree.<br />\nThe Greek, Roman and<br />\nEtruscan Gallery includes a<br />\nwidely known chryselephantine<br />\n(ivory and gold)snake goddess<br />\nfrom Crete (16th Century BC),<br />\npossibly from the palace of<br />\nMinos at Knossos. One of the<br />\noutstanding Greek pieces is a<br />\nsmall Hellenistic head which<br />\nonly recently has been identified as Alexander the Great<br />\n(356-322 BC).<br />\nAmong these important pieces is a rare Egyptian box in the<br />\nHellenistic style, with inlaid<br />\nwax panels. The colors are still<br />\nintact, as is, surpisingly<br />\nenough, the box itself.<br />\nIn Eutruria (Italy), Etruscans<br />\ncombined Greek and Near<br />\nEastern influences to create<br />\ntheir own style. Unlike the<br />\nGreek ivory works, which were<br />\nreserved for the gods, most<br />\nEtruscan ivories were the personal possessions of the<br />\nwealthy. The rich tombs of<br />\nEtruria have yielded combs,<br />\ntools, plaques, appliques and<br />\nfinely carved boxes of ivory.<br />\nIn the Early and Byzantine<br />\n<br />\nTHI<br />\n<br />\nAt<br />\nthe ls<br />\nand t<br />\nPlay<br />\nfore(<br />\nsmall<br />\nafter<br />\nthere<br />\nthrot<br />\nfour<br />\nSatui<br />\n2:30<br />\ndent<br />\nThea<br />\n<br />\nCr<br />\nPretri<br />\nThe<br />\nIY fu<br />\nmorz<br />\nAme<br />\nCent<br />\nNov.<br />\n$9.0(<br />\nhour<br />\nthroi<br />\nMon<br />\nstud(<br />\ncall<br />\n<br />\nTI<br />\nThei<br />\nTray<br />\n\"twc<br />\ncom<br />\ninto<br />\nJewi<br />\nPark<br />\nOct.<br />\nCourtesy of Walters Art Gallery<br />\n<br />\nIvory Statuette from earl) 15th centur) Netherlands<br />\n<br />\ngallery there are many small<br />\ndevotional altarpieces in the<br />\nform of diptychs and triptychs.<br />\nBeside the usual subjects of the<br />\nCrucifixion, Virgin and Child,<br />\nand various saints, there are<br />\nseveral pieces which show the<br />\nByzantine interest in the pagan<br />\nart of the ancient world.<br />\nThe Walter's is especially<br />\nrich in works from the Middle<br />\nAges, when ivory became a<br />\nfashionable art medium. Paris<br />\ndeveloped as a center of a large<br />\nivory industry, producing<br />\nliturgical objects, church furnishings and accessories such as<br />\ncombs. The exhibition includes<br />\none of the earliest statues of the<br />\nMadonna and the Child in the<br />\nGothic style. Its strong angular<br />\ndrapery is similar to the stone<br />\nfigures at the Amiens Cathedral<br />\nand yet, it suggests a tenderness<br />\nbetween the figures.<br />\nOne of the most popular objects of the collection is a<br />\nGothic casket from Paris(14th<br />\ncentury) decorated with scenes<br />\nfrom Arthurian and other me-<br />\n<br />\ndieval romances.<br />\nThere are few Renaissance<br />\nivories because ivory lost its<br />\npopularity during this period,<br />\nbut the 17th century revived the<br />\ninterest with Baroque. Among<br />\nthe delicately detailed works in<br />\nthis section is a standing cup of<br />\nivory and silver gilt, depicting<br />\na banquet of the classical gods<br />\nand goddesses.<br />\nIn the 18th century, ivory<br />\nproduction was industrialized<br />\nfor the production of objects<br />\nlike snuff boxes, knife handles<br />\nand religious sculptures.<br />\nHenry Walters' 19th century<br />\nivories include the prizewinning Three Theological Virtues of 1857 by Moreau-Vauthier, and Louis Ernest Barrias'<br />\nexquisite Mysterious and Veiled<br />\nNature Reveals Herself Before<br />\nScience made of ivory and<br />\nmounted in gilded and oxidized<br />\nsilver (after 1899).<br />\nThe exhibit ends with a little<br />\nArt Nouveau jewelry, designed<br />\neon!, on p. 14<br />\n<br />\nBond is Back<br />\ncont. from p. II<br />\nWhile the movie is fun and<br />\nabsorbing, some of the fantasy<br />\nand excitement has gone out of<br />\nthe Bond adventures. For example, the movie pinpoints the<br />\nfact that Bond is growing old.<br />\nAnother disappointment is the<br />\nsurprisingly lousy musical score<br />\nand the total absence of the<br />\nBond theme music. Some of the<br />\nsupporting characters have also<br />\nundergone a change for the<br />\n<br />\nworse. Moneypenny,0,and Q<br />\nhave been replaced with younger and duller models. Although<br />\nthe new Q greets Bond's return<br />\nhappily (\"I hope now we'll<br />\nhave some gratuitous sex and<br />\nviolence\"), the new leader of<br />\nthe British Secret Service is<br />\ndistressingly scornful of espionage and of spies, in particular 007's.

St. Mary's<br />\nby Howard Bregman<br />\nIf there was anything anyone<br />\non the Hopkins women's tennis<br />\nteam could complain about last<br />\nweek, it was probably that the<br />\nseason to date had been too<br />\npredictable.<br />\nThe team's eight victories<br />\nhad all come easily, winning 68<br />\nand losing only four individual<br />\nmatches in those meets. Defeats<br />\nhad come at the hands of a<br />\nDivision I opponent, American<br />\nUniversity, and to perennial national contender Mary Washington. So, after practically<br />\nsweeping the state Division II<br />\nand III tournament last weekend and rolling over Franklin<br />\nand Marshall on Monday, the<br />\nJays predicted little competition<br />\nfrom Mt. St. Mary's, a team<br />\nthat finished a-distant second at<br />\nthe tournament.<br />\nWell, there's an awful cliche<br />\nthat has something to do with<br />\neggs and chickens, but it probably applies here. By a 5-4<br />\nscore, in a meet shortened by<br />\ndarkness, Mt. St. Mary's handed the Jays their third loss of<br />\nthe season. The team that could<br />\nonly win one first place trophy<br />\nat the state tournament made<br />\nsome key substitutions and beat<br />\nthe team that had won eight.<br />\nGranted, it was close. Frustra-<br />\n<br />\ntingly close. The meet was<br />\ndecided by a first doubles<br />\ntiebreaker in the third set,<br />\nwhich the Jays' Geraldine<br />\nKlauber and Ken i Fischer<br />\ndropped, 2-7.<br />\nThe week had started surprisingly well, with the team winning its second straight state<br />\ntournament. Dominating is a<br />\nbetter word against five other<br />\nMaryland teams(Towson State,<br />\nGoucher, Loyola, Frostburg<br />\nState, and Mt. St. Mary's), the<br />\nJays racked up 52 of a possible<br />\n54 points, taking first place at<br />\nevery .position except third<br />\nsingles. Mt. St. Mary's came in<br />\nsecond with 24 points.<br />\n\"We blew everyone away,\"<br />\nbeamed Coach Kay Fowler.<br />\n\"We really got a team feeling\u2014<br />\nii was a team victory. We have<br />\na feeling of how good we really are.\" Several squads, most<br />\nnotably UMBC and Salisbury<br />\nState, did not show up for the<br />\ntournament, but it would have<br />\nmade little difference.<br />\nKlauber, at first singles, beat<br />\nTina Pinnoci of Frostburg, 6-7,<br />\n6-1, 6-2 for the title. Fischer, at.<br />\nsecond singles, bested Amy<br />\nChambers of Mt. St. Mary's,<br />\n6-2, 6-4. Men -Jo Borzilleri, at<br />\nthird singles, took second place,<br />\nlosing in the final round to Jill<br />\nRafano of Mt. St. Mary's, 5-7,<br />\n<br />\n4-410407<br />\n,<br />\n01<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nDave Simon<br />\n<br />\nThird singles player Men -Jo Borzilleri look second place in the state<br />\ntournament.<br />\n<br />\n1-6. At fourth, fifth, and sixth<br />\nsingles, Nina Urban, Kathy<br />\nMarch, and Monica Canilang<br />\nall won in straight sets.<br />\nOn Monday, at Homewood,<br />\nthe Jays faced a usually strong<br />\nFranklin and Marshall team,<br />\nand were mildly surprised after<br />\na 9-0 victory. \"If you had told<br />\n<br />\nBooters Lose Twice In Overtime<br />\nAmy Compton<br />\nIn their 'last two games<br />\nagainst Towson State and<br />\nSwarthmore, the Hopkins' soccer team has ended regular play<br />\nin a tie, and then lost in<br />\nOvertime.<br />\nLast Saturday the team<br />\ntraveled up,to Swarthmore. The<br />\ngame was scoreless until overtime play. Swarthmore netted a<br />\ngoal with only 15 seconds left<br />\nID t he first overtime half. They<br />\nwon the game 1-0. Statistics<br />\nshow JHU with three shots on<br />\ngoal, three corner kicks, and<br />\nthree saves for goalie Ray<br />\n'Giurceo. Swarthmore came<br />\naway with five shots on goal,<br />\nfive corner kicks, and two<br />\ngoalie saves.<br />\nWednesday evening Hopkins<br />\ntook on Towson under the<br />\nlights. Towson, a Division 1<br />\n<br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br />\n<br />\nRick de la Cruz and David Piaui<br />\nPractice for F&M.<br />\n<br />\nteam, had a 9-1 record before<br />\nthe game. In addition to leading<br />\ntheir conference, Towson is<br />\nranked on the Eastern Seaboard.<br />\nHopkins scored the first goal<br />\nof the game. With an assist<br />\nfrom Kevin Howes, Danny<br />\nOlszewski sent .a beautiful shot<br />\nsailing over the Towson goalie's<br />\nhead to put JHU in the lead. It<br />\nwas ironic that Olszewski<br />\nscored Hopk in's goal since the<br />\nTowson head coach is his older<br />\nbrother. According to Danny<br />\n0, \"I've played against him<br />\nbefore. It's no big deal.\" The<br />\nfirst half ended with the score<br />\nat 1-0.<br />\nTowson scored once near the<br />\nend of the second half. It was<br />\nthe only other goal in regulation<br />\nplay, so the game continued<br />\nwith two 10 minute overtime<br />\nhalves to break the 1-1 tie. With<br />\nonly 30 seconds left in the first<br />\nhalf, Towson scored and went<br />\non to win the game 1-1.<br />\nThe statistics show how close<br />\nthe game was. Hopkins had<br />\nnine shots on goal, two corner<br />\nkicks, and 11 saves by Giuerceo. Towson had 11 shots, 71<br />\ncorners, and eight saves.<br />\nAccording to Coach Zimmerman,\"I couldn't be prouder of the way we played. We<br />\nwere mentally ready for this<br />\ngame. I think we caught them<br />\na little bit by surprise. The team<br />\nshould hold their heads up;<br />\nthey played their hearts out.\"<br />\n\"Towson's going home feeling lucky they beat us,\"<br />\nFullback Paul Miller said.<br />\n<br />\nThe team has four games<br />\nleft, and in Zimmerman's opinion, \"IF we play like we can<br />\nplay, we'll win all four.\" The<br />\nBlue Jays' next two challenges<br />\nwill both be home\u2014today<br />\nagainst F&M and Wednesday<br />\nagainst Widener.<br />\n<br />\nme last spring that we would<br />\nbeat F&M 9-0 this year, I would<br />\nhave laughed,\" said Fowler. In<br />\nthis meet, unlike some others,<br />\nthe breaks went Hopkins' way.<br />\nThe team won all three. tiebreakers t11 were played, and<br />\nended up winning every set of<br />\nthe meet, upping its season<br />\nrecord to 9-2.<br />\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a<br />\nconfident Fowler did not<br />\nhesitate to challenge the fates,<br />\nsaying, \"We will be 10-2 by<br />\ntomorrow.\" After the sweep of<br />\nthe state tournament, there was<br />\nno reason to doubt her prediction.<br />\nBut Mt. St. Mary's came<br />\nto Homewood with a few hidden cards. Sending its state<br />\ntournament third singles<br />\nchamp, Jill Rafano, to play<br />\n<br />\nfourth singles against Nina Urban, it brought in two players<br />\nagainst Borzilleri at third<br />\nsingles and March at fifth<br />\nsingles who had not played at<br />\nthe State's. Klauber and Fischer<br />\ntriumphed at first and second<br />\nsingles, 6-1, 6-0, and 6-4, 6-3,<br />\nrespectively, as they had done<br />\nlast weekend; but Borzilleri fell<br />\n3-6, 4-6, and March followed<br />\nsuit, 1-6, 5-7. Urban, who lost<br />\nher first set, 1-6, came back to<br />\nwin the second, 6-4, but fell in<br />\nthe last, 3-6. Canilang's 775, 6-4<br />\nvictory sent the teams into<br />\ndoubles play, tied at three matches apiece.<br />\nA powerful Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nthird doubles team overcame<br />\nHopkins' March and Julie<br />\nHorth, 4-6, 1-6. But Coach<br />\nFowler knew that at first and<br />\n,second doubles she faced a<br />\nrematch of the final round of<br />\nthe state tournament. She<br />\ncounted on a win from the<br />\npowerful team of Klauber and<br />\nFischer, who had disposed of<br />\ntheir opponents last Sunday,<br />\n6-4, 6-4. The pressure was on<br />\nBorzilleri and Urban to win<br />\nalso. Because of darkness, the<br />\nsecond dobules match could<br />\nonly go to one set. It was an<br />\neasy win for Borzilleri and Urban, 6-2. But Klauber and<br />\nFischer lost their first set, 4-6,<br />\nand after winning the second,<br />\n6-1, found themselves at 3-3 as<br />\nthe sun was taking its leave. A<br />\ntiebreaker was played, and<br />\nKlauber and Fischer found<br />\nthemselves at the short end of<br />\na 2-7 score-, while the Jays as a<br />\nteam were at the short end of<br />\na 5-4 meet.<br />\n\"We just blew it,\" said<br />\nFowler.<br />\nSo, at 9-3, the team finishes<br />\nits season this weekend with the<br />\nSalisbury State Invitaitional.<br />\n<br />\nLaxers Perfect For Fall Season<br />\nby David Brengel<br />\nThe men's lacrosse team<br />\noutlasted Mount Washington<br />\nClub, 14-12, last Thursday to<br />\nremain unbeaten, having previously defeated Loyola twice,<br />\nas well as the Hopkins' Alumni.<br />\nMount Washington jumped<br />\nout to a quick 5-0 lead within<br />\nthe first six minutes. Their giveand-go, fast-breaking offense<br />\nseemed to confuse the Blue<br />\n.lays' defense, which often left<br />\nmen, unmarked, in front of the<br />\ncrease. Goalie Larry Quinn<br />\nstarted for the Blue Jays, but<br />\nwas able to stop only one out<br />\nof the first six Mount Washington shots.

Networks<br />\nhave increasingly turned to producing special, \"one shot\" TV<br />\nevents such as miniseries.<br />\nCable has also siphoned off<br />\na small element of the highly<br />\neducated and affluent television<br />\naudience with its cultural programming, as well as teenagers<br />\nwith programming like MTV.<br />\nThis situation leaves networks<br />\nconcentrating their programs<br />\non the mass audience.<br />\nCarter said he finds other<br />\nfacets of technology less important to the medium. He thinks<br />\nthe home computer boom is essentially a fad and, while it can<br />\nserve valuable purposes for<br /><br />\nsome, the overall population<br />\nwil tire of using its screen for<br />\ndiversion much as the young<br />\npeople have tired of video<br />\ngames recently.<br />\nThe second segment of television, information, is what<br />\nCarter said he thinks will keep<br />\nthe networks from bowing to<br />\ncable's power.<br />\n\"News programs are a huge<br />\ninformational tool\u2014network<br />\nTV can survive as long as their<br />\nnews is the best,\" said Carter.<br />\n\"Handheld cameras have made<br />\nit possible for the entire nation<br />\nto be witnesses to events like<br />\nassassinations. We expect newspeople to be there.\"<br />\nCarter said that overall, TV<br />\nnews is very professional, but<br />\nthat accuracy can be a problem.<br />\nThe pressure for a channel to be<br />\nfirst with a breaking story keeps<br />\nreporters from waiting to check<br />\nfacts, and false information<br />\nsometimes results.<br />\nCarter spoke tolerantly of the<br />\nthird area of TV programming,<br />\nentertainment. He states there<br />\nhas been bad TV entertainment<br />\nthroughout the medium's 30year history and it is not<br />\nprimarily a recent problem.<br />\nMindless situation comedies<br />\nand game shows are developed<br />\nto satisfy the typical TV consumer, and Carter thinks the<br />\ndemand for shows is not always<br />\naccurately determined,<br />\nThe famous Nielsen ratings<br />\nare conducted by some 1200<br />\n\"Nielsen families,\" a cross section of the American public. A<br /><br />\nmechanical monitor records<br />\nwhat time the television set is on<br />\nand which station is watched;<br />\nwho the person watching is,<br />\nwhether he or she actually likes<br />\nthe program, and whether anyone is in the room watching at<br />\nall is not recorded.<br />\nThe most perfect form of TV<br />\nentertainment is sports, said<br />\nCarter.<br />\n\"They are always done well,<br />\nand are entertaining as well as<br />\ndiverting. And diversion serves<br />\nas useful purpose when not<br />\ndone in excess.\"<br />\nThe bottom line in television,<br /><br />\nCarter said, is money.<br />\n\"I think money rules TV<br />\nfrom top to bottom, and this<br />\nincludes public TV, which has<br />\nto bow and scrape for it,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe said the critic has little<br />\npower over the networks, for<br />\ncriticism has never dislodged a<br />\nhit show from the top. A faltering show, however, can gain<br />\nstrength from supportive criticism; he cites one of his favorite<br />\nshows, Hill Street Blues, as an<br />\nexample of a show kept on for<br />\nits good reviews which gradually captured a loyal following.<br /><br />\nMuller Says<br />\nUnlikely<br />\nTeach<br />\nHe'll<br />\ncont from p.

But was any action taken? According to Bowie, security in the three areas<br />\nwas increased, and the Northern District of<br />\nthe Baltimore Police offered their full<br />\ncooperation.<br />\nAugust 10, 1983. A female student was<br />\nraped while waiting for a ride along San<br />\nMartin Drive.

NATO has<br />\nno land based missiles capable<br />\nof reaching the Soviet Union<br />\nbut it does have shorter range<br />\nsystems for use against Eastern<br />\nEurope and tactical weapons<br />\nfor battlefield use.<br /><br />\nSecond, the approximately<br />\n500 Soviet theater missiles<br />\ndesigned for use in Europe are<br />\nnot based in Eastern Europe(as<br />\nstated in the article) but in the<br />\nSoviet Union.<br />\nThird, President Reagan's<br />\nUN speech proposed that the<br />\nUnited States would not match<br />\nthe entire Soviet Asian and<br />\nEuropean Theater deployment<br />\nof missiles with American<br />\nmissiles in Europe\u2014not as the<br />\narticle stated, \"the U.S. would<br />\nmatch SS-20's with the number<br />\nof missiles of Britain and<br />\nFrance.\"<br />\nFourth, the major reason the<br />\nUnited States has rejected the<br />\nSoviet proposal to reduce<br />\nSoviet missile numbers tn the<br />\nFrench and British levels is that<br />\nthe United States (along with<br />\nthe governments of Britain and<br />\nFrance) view the British and<br />\nFrench nuclear arms as a<br />\nminimal deterrent for those<br />\ncountries and not part of the<br />\ndefense of Western Europe.<br />\nFifth, it should be made clear<br />\nthat I am not happy with the<br />\nneed to deploy long range<br />\nnuclear weapons in Europe. I<br />\nhope that once it is demonstrated that NATO has the will<br />\nand capability to match the<br />\nSoviet SS-20 threat, either an<br />\narms control solution could be<br />\nworked out or Europe would<br />\nrely more on (increased) conventional defenses to deter the<br />\nSoviet Union.<br />\nThere are other points I<br />\nwould like to clarify but in the<br />\ninterests of space will stop here.<br />\nThis is obviously a complex<br />\nissve alc,11,5yrnpat,bize wit11 the<br /><br />\nefforts of your reporter and<br />\neditor to summarize confusing<br />\nideas in a short article.

If this were the case,<br />\nmost would doubt that he<br />\nwould still be around.<br />\nThe better possibility is that<br />\nMr. Larkin simply is afflicted<br />\nwith an inability to express exactly what he wants to say. It's<br />\nlikely that this is the case: this<br />\nfaux pas is much like one he<br />\nmade September 2 while addressing this year's freshman<br />\nadvisors, when he said that only one rape had occurred this<br />\nfall. After the crowd's reaction<br />\nto his gaffe, he quickly added<br />\nthat it was the first rape in two<br />\nyears.

Peptides are short polymers (3-60 units) of amino<br />\nacids, the buildings blocks of<br />\nproteins. These small molecules<br />\nhad been dismissed as products<br />\nof protein degradation, rather<br />\nthan as a necessary link in the<br />\nchain of hormonal regulation<br />\nof the body's activities. Much<br />\nmedical research has been<br />\nfocused upon the effects of<br />\nneuropeptides, and the possibilities for their clinical use are<br />\nstartling. Russell W. Pelham,<br />\nthe Director of Pharmaceutical<br />\nResearch at Sereno Laboratories in Randolph, Massachusetts, speculates that \"within<br />\nthe next decade or two, they<br />\ncould become even more widely used than antibiotics.\"<br />\nFuture applications may include treatments for infertility,<br />\ncancer, ulcers, and immune<br />\ndeficiencies, in addition to playing an important new role in<br />\nbirth control for both men and<br />\nwomen.<br />\nThe hypothalamus is a region<br />\nof the brain under particularly<br />\nintense scrutiny. It appears to<br />\nbe the single most important<br />\ncontrol center for regulation of<br />\nthe internal environment, as<br />\nwell as an area associated with<br />\nthe expression of emotion. It is,<br />\nin fact, related to many basic<br />\nhormonal pathways, in addition to the control of thirst,<br /><br />\ntrophic hormone)stimulates the<br />\nadrenal cortex to provide glucocorticoids, which cause the<br />\nliver to convert stored proteins<br />\ninto glucose, the sugar molecule<br />\nassociated with energy production. Prolactin (PRL) is also<br />\nreleased by the anterior<br />\npituitary and promotes milk<br />\nproduction and secretion in the<br />\nmammary glands. Thyroid<br />\nstimulating hormone (TSH)<br />\nboth stimulates and maintains<br />\nmetabolic activities and inhibits<br />\nthe release of calcium from<br />\n.bone tissue. Both oxytocin and<br />\nvasopressin are secreted in the<br />\nhypothalamus, and travel to the<br />\npituitary gland for storage and<br />\nrelease into the peripheral circulation. Oxytocin stimulates<br />\nuterine contractions and the<br />\nrelease of milk, while vasopression (antidiuretic hormone)<br />\ncontrols water retention and excretion in the kidneys.<br />\nFollicle stimulating hormone<br />\n(FSH)and leutinizing hormone<br />\n(LH)are largely responsible for<br />\nthe hormonal maintenance and<br />\nstimulation of the testes and<br />\novaries, and the functions of<br />\nsperm and egg production.<br />\nLeutinizing hormone, in particular, controls the secretion of<br />\nthe steroids responsible for the<br />\nmale and female secondary sexual characteristics, and also<br />\nstimulates ovulation. Leutinizing hormone releasing hormone<br />\n(L11RH) is produced in the<br />\nhypothalamus and was shown<br />\nin 1971 to be a polypeptide<br />\ncomposed of ten amino acids,<br />\nand responsible for the release<br />\nof both CH and FSH from the<br /><br />\nFig. I.

The<br />\nmethod entails deeply anesthetizing the animals, perfusing<br />\ntheir brains with acrolein, and<br />\nremoving the organ. The hypothalamus was then sectioned to<br />\n50 microns thickness on a<br />\nVibratome in preparation for<br />\nthe analysis. The tissue was exposed to a pre-treatment regimen to remove the fixative<br />\nprior to the actual immunocytochemistry.<br />\nImmonocytochemistry simply involes the combination of<br />\nchemistry and immunology to<br />\nstudy the properties of cells in<br />\na particular tissue. The basic<br />\npremise behind immunology<br />\nstates that antibodies are extremely specific and are generated to recognize and bind to the<br />\ninvading \"body\". Once the<br />\n3ntibody-antigen couple is<br />\n:ormed, the invading particle is<br />\ninactivated or destroyed. In the<br />\nimmunocytochemistry lab,<br />\nseveral different types of<br />\nantibody-containing anti-sera<br />\nare t tilized to bind to the cells<br />\nof tl-e hypothalamus that produce LHRH, and then color<br />\nthese sites through chemical<br />\nreactions. In this manner, the<br />\nreactive cells can be studied<br />\nwith the light and electron<br />\nmicroscopes.<br />\nA technique described by<br />\nLudwig A. Sternbereer in 1974<br />\nis used in Dr. King's laboratory<br />\nto localize LHRH fibers. This<br />\ntechnique involves the application of a specific primary antiserum that was produced in<br />\na rabbit against synthetic<br />\nLHRH. A secondary antiserum that is produced in sheep<br />\nagainst the rabbit anti-serum<br />\nis applied in excess to the<br />\nbrain tissue. The third step<br />\ninvolves the use of an antiperoxidase that was purified<br />\nfrom antiserum produced in the<br />\nrabbit. In step four, a peroxidase is applied which binds to<br />\nthe antiperioxidase of step<br />\nthree. Next, peroxide and the<br />\ncompound diamonobenzidine<br />\n(DAB) are added. Peroxide is<br />\nthe substrate of the enzyme<br />\nperoxidase, and when these two<br />\ncompounds react, an electron<br />\ntransfer reaction occurs. The<br />\nelectrons are transferred to<br />\nDAB,causing it to turn brown.<br />\nIn the last step of this process,<br />\nthis complex is reacted with<br />\nosmium tetroxide to form an<br />\ninsoluble structure that is black<br />\nfor light microscopy and opaque for electron microscopy.<br />\nIn the PAP (peroxidaseantiperoxidase) technique of<br />\nSternberger, the PAP complex<br />\nis preformed and Ynore convenient to apply. Using Sternberger's technique; -the mole-<br /><br />\ncule under investigation is attached to a colored antibody<br />\nstructure that can be easily<br />\nstudied under the light and electron microscope. The location<br />\nof the LHRH producing cells<br />\nhas been discerned with this<br />\nmethod, and pathways leading<br />\nfrom the hypothalamus to the<br />\npituitary are also being defined. The technique is highly<br />\nsensitive and dilutions of these<br /><br />\nsecretion of LH and FSH.<br />\nThe marketability of these<br />\nneuropeptides is apparent,<br />\nespecially in the field of contraception. Both superagonists<br />\nand agonists of LHRH would<br />\nprevent or decrease the production of LH and FSH, and<br />\nthereby alter the reproductive<br />\ncycle. A superagonist being<br />\nstudied by Samuel S.C. Yen at<br />\nthe University of California,<br /><br />\nThe Sternherger\u2014PAP Technique.<br /><br />\nexpensive anti-sera are performed before their usage. This<br />\nspecificity has even allowed the<br />\nlocation of granules within the<br />\nLHRH reactive perikarya. Dr.<br />\nKing has developed a method<br />\nof using different anti-sera and<br />\ndifferent binding requirements<br />\nto determine how the decapeptide is produced within the cell.<br />\nThe transformations that occur<br />\nbefore it is released to the<br />\npituitary are also being determined.<br />\nThe peptides produced in the<br />\nhypothalamus and in other<br />\nregions of the brain and body<br />\nplay a vital role in the hormonal<br />\n'system. Since these compounds<br />\narea short length, they can be<br />\nartificially synthesized once<br />\ntheir amino acid sequence is<br />\ndetermined. Analogs of these<br />\nneuropeptides can also be<br />\nmanufactured such that substitutions or deletions are made at<br />\none or more positions on the<br />\nchain. These analogs fall into<br />\nthree categories, depending on<br />\nthe place at which LHRH was<br />\nmodified. They are agonists<br />\nwhich have as much or more<br />\nactivity; Antagonists, which<br />\nblock the activity of the original<br />\nhormone; and superagonists<br />\nwhich are so highly active that<br />\nthey behave as antagonists by<br />\n\"shorting out\" the pituitary's<br /><br />\nPaul Brunette<br /><br />\nSan Diego, appears to decrease<br />\nthe duration of the second half<br />\nof menstruation, preventing the<br />\nfertilized egg's implantation on<br />\nthe uterine wall. Extensive<br />\nstudies are needed to verify the<br />\nmethod's safety and efficiency.<br />\nBut the results are promising.<br />\nSimilarly, antagonists to<br />\nLHRH are useful in altering<br />\nsperm production in males. In<br />\none study, sperm counts were<br />\nreduced to zero. These analogs,<br />\nhowever, require further investigation before large scale<br />\ntrials can begin.<br />\nHypothalamic releasing hormones are clearly an integral<br />\nfactor in the processes of hormonal control. lmmunocytochemistry is an extremely<br />\nvaluable technique for studying<br />\nthe exact sites of peptide production, and immunocytochemists such as Dr. King have<br />\ncontributed greatly to the<br />\nunderstanding of the action of<br />\nthese compounds. LHRH, in<br />\nparticular, promises new alternatives in reproductive hormone control. Other peptides<br />\nare finding wider clinical applications in treatments for hormonal imbalances, yet many<br />\nquestions must be answered before the full potential of peptide<br />\ndrugs is reached.<br /><br />\nImmunoreactive 1.11R11 producing cells of the h)pothalamus.<br /><br />\n8/OCTOBER 21, 1983<br /><br />\nThere Are Still A Few Bugs In The System<br />\nby Timothy McNamara<br />\nFor many JHU students, the<br />\nyearly return to classes at<br />\nHopkins often involves a loss<br />\nof many luxuries taken for<br />\ngranted at home. One creature<br />\ncomfort, however, that does all<br />\ntoo frequently manifest itself in<br />\nthe domiciles of students is the<br />\nroach.<br />\nPerhaps cockroaches are attracted to students by the less<br />\nthan sterile and hygienic surroundings that seem to be an integral part of college life, or<br />\nmaybe, being nocturnal, they<br />\nlike the night life. Whatever the<br />\ncause, if their numbers are in<br />\nany wayindicative of their sentiments about roommates,<br />\nroaches seem to find cohabitation with college students a particularly desirable experience.<br />\nJohn, a JHU senior who for<br />\nobvious reasons wished to keep<br />\nhis full name confidential, candidly described what is probably not an altogether uncommon situation for many Hopkins students. \"In our apartment we have seven cockroach<br />\nhotels, and there's never any<br />\nvacancy. We've got thousands<br />\nof them.\"<br />\nWhile John's roach situation<br />\nmay be slightly worse than the<br />\nnorm, the uncontestable fact<br />\nremains that roaches are a big<br />\nproblem for students. In fact,<br />\naccording to Jim Porter, an entomologist from Baltimore and<br /><br />\na member of the American<br />\nRegistry of Professional Entomologists, the average apartment in Baltimore contains at<br />\nleast twelve of the pesky insects.<br />\nHowever, few people realize the<br />\npotential health hazard of these<br />\npests.<br />\nLike many other household<br />\npests, roaches deposit their excrements almost constantly onto just about everything, and<br />\nthey pick up bacteria and<br />\nviruses from whatever they<br />\nhappen to be crawling over. In<br />\njust one pass over a bacteria<br />\nsample, a roach can pick up<br />\nnearly 13,470 bacteria, according to Porter. No wonder they<br />\nare partially responsible for the<br />\nspread of allergies, typhoid,<br />\nleprosy, plague, food poisoning, polio, parasitic worms, and<br />\na host of other illnesses.<br />\nWhile there are some 3,500<br />\nknown species of cockroaches,<br />\nand possibly as many more<br />\nunidentified species, only four<br />\nmajor species find Baltimore's<br />\nclimate sufficiently appealing to<br />\nlive here year round. These four<br />\nspecies are the Oriental, American, German, and Brown-banded varieties. They range in size<br />\nfrom half an inch for the German to two inches in the case<br />\nof the American.<br />\nNormally, roaches are omnivorous; they eat everything a<br />\nhuman eats and a lot more.<br />\nMost pest roaches, however,<br />\nseem to have a special affinity<br /><br />\nfor starchy and sugary foods, cockroaches is about 20 to 30<br />\nbut they have been known to days.

Only after the insect is<br />\ncertain that the morsel contains<br />\nno poisons will it actually eat<br />\nthe food. Amazingly, a roach<br />\ncan live without food for three<br />\nmonths, and without food and<br />\nwater for one.<br />\nPerhaps as a result of their<br />\ncare in thoroughly checking<br />\ntheir food, roaches have a surprisingly long natural lifespan,<br />\napproaching three years for<br />\nsome common domestic pests.<br />\nIn that time, a single pair of<br />\nroaches could conceivably produce several million descendants. As Porter indicated, the<br />\ngestation period for most<br /><br />\nlike the motor of a refrigerator.\"<br />\nFrequently, these groups of<br />\ncockroaches collectively migrate. Their migrations usually<br />\ncover only a short distance,<br />\nfrom one side of an apartment<br />\nbuilding to the other, for example. Such changes in the focus<br />\nof infestation make attempts to<br />\neliminate them particularly<br />\ndifficult.<br />\nUsually the. most effective<br />\nmethod of eliminating a roach<br />\nproblem is to have a dwelling<br />\nsprayed by a professional exterminator. Short of a professional extermination, however,<br /><br />\nthere is quite a range of steps an<br />\nindividual can take to ward off<br />\nthe pests.<br />\nMany students find roach<br />\ntraps of the \"Roach Motel\"<br />\ntype to be very effective. Porter<br />\nrecommends a simple glue<br />\nboard placed near a crack<br />\nwhere roaches are likely to hide.<br />\nBoric acid which works to dry<br />\nthe skin of roaches is another<br />\nalternative, although its effects<br />\nare a little less immediate than<br />\nsome of the other methods.<br />\nAnd there is a plethora of<br />\nsprays available on the market<br />\nfor the do-it-yourself exterminator. Perhaps the best<br />\ncockroach control, though, is<br />\njust good sanitation and hygiene.<br />\nWhile cockroaches certainly<br />\nrank among the filthiest and<br />\nmost annoying breed of animals alive, their tenacity and<br />\nability to adapt themselves to<br />\nnew environments is nothing<br />\nless than admirable. Cockroaches have existed essentially unchanged for millions of<br />\nyears. They were around long<br />\nbefore man first ventured down<br />\nfrom the trees and will likely be<br />\nhere long after we're gone.<br />\nStill, that is not much consolation for someone whose<br />\nhome is infested by roaches. As<br />\nPorter concluded, \"I'm a believer in the theory that everything here has its purpose, but<br />\nwith the cockroach, I have no<br />\nidea what it is.\"<br /><br />\nNORTHEAST MARKET LUNCHEON SPECIALS<br />\n2101 E.

They<br />\nhave been drifting about the city for over sixty years now,<br />\nhaving originated in 1916 as the<br />\nfirst successful performers of<br />\navante garde one-act plays in<br />\nBaltimore. During their conception, the Little Theater<br />\nMovement had already caught<br />\non in many other cities nationwide, and Baltimore had a demand for such an endeavor.<br />\nThe Vagabond Theater is<br />\npresently located in Fell's Point<br />\non South Broadway. Because<br />\nthe theater is a good size and<br />\nbecause several desirable alterations in structure are feasible,<br />\nthis is where they intend to stay<br />\nindefinitely. Before moving to<br />\nFell's Point in 1973, they tried<br />\nworking in places ranging from<br />\na small theater in Mount Vernon, where the Depression<br />\ncaused them to sacrifice their<br />\nexperimentation in favor of<br />\ntried and true Broadway-type<br />\nhits, to a 900 seat auditorium at<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory during the 60's, which was a disaster. Its size was not conducive<br />\nto the successful revival of intimate experimental tradition.<br />\nThe audience to which the Vagabond Players has consistently<br />\ncatered is too specialized to<br />\nneed that much space. President Bruce Johnson is happy<br />\nabout their secure residence. He<br />\nsays, \"It was debilitating to be<br />\nmoving. It made it hard to gain<br />\na faithful audience. This place<br />\n(the Fell's Point location) was<br />\nscheduled to become part of a<br />\nhighway circumventing Balti-<br /><br />\nmore. When we first started using it, it was known as Corral's<br />\nBar, although it was then<br />\nowned by the city. What luck to<br />\nfall into this place\u2014it was a<br />\ndecrepidated, run-down, awful<br />\narea. We got the place for<br />\n$25,000 and it's now probably<br />\nworth $250,000.\"<br />\nThe city had to approve the<br />\nalterations which the Vagabonds made on their theater in<br />\norder to maintain the atmosphere of the historical<br />\ndistrict. They have fashioned<br />\nboth the exterior and the interior to look like a 19th century opera house: This reversion to the past would seem<br />\ncontrary to the theater's professed commitment to new<br />\nscript exposure, but both contribute to the culture of Baltimore and the celebration of<br />\nart, which is part of the company's purpose.<br />\nJohnson points out a cardboard miniature of what he<br />\nwants the Vagabond Theater to<br />\neventually look like. It models<br />\na second story for the stage so<br />\nthat their production options<br />\nwon't be so limited as well as<br />\nadditional seating.<br />\nAll decisions for the company are made by a twelve<br />\nmember board, headed by<br />\nBruce Johnson who has been<br />\npresident for fifteen years. He<br />\ndeals primarily with the directing and administration, preferring behind the scenes work to<br />\nacting. He did play the title role<br />\nin The Drunkard for eight<br />\nyears, though, before his involvement with the Vagabonds.<br />\nHe teaches in a middle school<br />\nfor a living, as the Vagabond<br />\nPlayers is an amateur oganization. He speaks highly of the<br />\ndevotion of the board, staff,<br />\nand actors who have put in<br />\nlarge chunks of time, effort,<br />\nand in the past, funds to improve the productions. \"Tom<br /><br />\nGrahn is in the box office 165 events, such as their Saturday<br />\nnights a year. Anna Granofsky morning writer's workshop that<br />\nis retired, but I still don't see is open to the public, and their<br />\nwhere she gets the time that she Summer Festival held in conputs in for the Board of Gover- junction with the Fell's Point<br />\nnors; she works hard for the ci- Theater, in which Baltimore<br />\nty as well. None of the actors playwrights give public readings<br />\nare paid, although they could of their current works. Audiprobably make it in pro tions for all plays are open.<br />\nJohnson assures, \"People say<br />\ntheater.\"<br />\nThe Vagabonds try to pull Vagabond is a clique, but that's<br />\ntogether different cultures flat out wrong\u2014we're looking<br />\nwithin the city through various for new blood.\"<br /><br />\nThe works that are picked<br />\neach season to be performed<br />\nare meant to reflect the changing styles and themes of today's<br />\nplaywrights, without ignoring<br />\nthe old. They work on a line<br />\nbetween mainstream entertainment and the more controversial new styles that may be considered offensive to the Vagabond's subscribers\u2014mainly a<br />\nsophisticated, middle-aged<br />\ncrowd. Says Johnson,\"We try<br />\nto be interesting and entertaining without being confronting\u2014a play should not assault<br />\nthe audience. We don't want to<br />\nbend entirely the other way<br />\neither, though. Rainmaker is<br />\nour only bow to commerical<br />\ntheater this year.\"<br />\nThe Vagabond Players' subscribers are becoming more<br />\nnumerous, and the board is<br />\nhappy with the theater's progress, but it sees a possibility of<br />\nproblems in the future. The<br />\ntheater is a major time commitment because there is a very<br />\nsmall core of people administrating for the company. Few<br />\nyoung people have voiced an interest in helping with administration. The Vagabond<br />\nPlayers' company hopes to find<br />\nsome younger people established in the Fell's Point area who<br />\nare willing to work with directing, managing, and administrating. There are times when<br />\nJohnson feels that movies and<br />\nkielvision have pre-empted not<br />\nonly the theater, but especially<br />\nthe little theater. \"We have a<br />\nlow profile,\" says Johnson,<br />\n\"but the attention we have<br />\ndrawn has been generally positive, and that reassures us that<br />\nwhat we are doing is worthwhile.\"<br />\nThis is the third in a series of<br />\narticles about theaters in the<br />\nBaltimore area.<br /><br />\n007 Is Back So Never Say Never Again<br />\nby Marianne Perrella<br />\nBond is back, and thank<br />\nGod, this time he's Sean Connery. Never Say Never Again,<br />\nwhile not the best of Connery's<br />\nBond films, is still vastly superior to some of the recent Roger<br />\nMoore duds like Moonraker<br />\nand For Your Eyes Only.<br />\nThis latest Bond adventure<br />\nbegins very differently from<br />\nany other of the series: an aging 007 is sent to a fitness camp<br />\nto get back into shape with vitamins, weightlifting, and herbal enemas. But this somewhat<br />\ndepressing focus on Bond's<br />\nostensibly faded condition is<br />\nsoon followed by a more satisfying return to typical 007<br />\nintrigues.<br />\nThere are some really exciting passages in this part of<br />\nthe film\u2014a motorcycle chase, a<br />\nlittle first-class waterskiing, and<br />\na rescue on horseback. Connery<br />\nis his usual sexy, humorous self.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nIn one notable scene, a bomb<br />\nblows up his bedroom; from<br />\nanother room he and a woman<br />\nwatch from her bed. \"I'm glad<br />\nwe picked your place,\" he tells<br />\nher without missing a beat.<br />\nThe other principal characters are, for the most part,<br />\nadeptly portrayed. Maria Brandauer is convincing as the babyfaced but vengeful villain who<br />\nblackmails the world with two<br />\nstolen American nuclear-armed<br />\ncruise missiles. Kim Basinger is<br />\nhum-drum as the woman-whoturns-traitor as a result of<br />\nBond's charm.<br />\nPossibly the best performance is given by Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush. Wrapping snakes around her neck,<br />\nbragging about her sexual<br />\nprowess, laughing about<br />\nmurder, or pointing a gun<br />\ndirectly at Bond's groin, she<br />\nplays the \"bad-guy\" with fiendish exuberance.<br />\ncont. on p. 12<br /><br />\n.\u2022<br /><br />\nBond, though older, is still his sexy, humorous self.<br /><br />\nWarner Bros<br /><br />\n12/OCTOBER 21, 1983<br /><br />\nIvory: The Sumptuous Art<br />\nby Mary Butler<br /><br />\nICE CREAM<br />\nPARLOUR<br /><br />\nOLD<br />\nFASHIONED<br /><br />\nFEATURING BARRICINI ICE CREAM<br />\nMAKE YOUR OWN SUNDAE &amp; SPLIT<br />\nUNLIMITED TOPPING BAR<br />\nICE CREAM CAKES MADE TO ORDER<br />\nOPEN 7 DAYS<br />\n1 1 AM -12 MID<br /><br />\n345 E. 33rd St.<br />\n467-1014<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\n7777677-rR7777,17<br /><br />\nrE\"<br /><br />\nGET NEXT SUNDAE AT /<br />\n1<br />\n2 PRICE<br />\n\u2022<br />\nI<br />\n...<br />\nGOOD ON THIS VISIT OR NET<br /><br />\nYou Can Wear<br /><br />\nCONTACTS<br /><br />\nNew Technological Developments In Improved Eye Wear<br />\nNow Make Contact Lenses Available To Most Everyone<br />\n...1\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022,<br /><br />\n15%<br />\nDISCOUNT<br />\nON CONCACT LENSES<br />\nAND FRAMES TO<br />\nSTUDENTS AND<br />\nFACULTY BODY<br />\nFree Consultation<br />\nAsk About Our Free<br />\n30 Day Trial Period<br /><br />\n\u2022Permalens you can wear two<br />\nweeks at a time<br />\n\u2022 Gas permeable, semi-soft<br />\nlenses<br />\n\u2022Bausch &amp; Lomb Softcon Soft<br />\nLenses<br />\n\u2022Bi-Focal Jnd Ultra Thin Hard<br />\nLenses<br /><br />\nEye examinations<br />\nDaytime or Evening<br />\nBy Appointment.<br />\nGlaucoma Testing.<br /><br />\n243-8884<br />\nDR.

The show, Ivory:<br />\nThe Sumptuous Art, offers a<br />\ncomprehensive view of the<br />\nmaterial from 4500 BC to 1900<br />\nAD. Carvings in ivory represent<br />\nsome of man's earliest efforts<br />\nto form images and has remained a primary sculptural<br />\nmedium throughout western<br />\nhistory.<br />\nThe current collection was<br />\nput together almost entirely by<br />\nHenry Walters, who left his collection and gallery to Baltimore<br />\nin 1931. The Walters has one of<br />\nthe six largest collections in the<br />\nworld.<br />\nThe exhibit opens with pictures of ivory carvers and a<br />\ndisplay of the sources of ivory.<br />\nMost of this collection's ivory<br />\ncame from elephant tusks and<br />\nhippopotamus teeth. But the<br />\ntusks of many different animals<br />\nhave also been used since antiquity, including mammoths,<br />\nwalruses, narwhals, boar and<br />\nwarthogs. Ivory-like objects<br />\nwere made of bone and horn<br />\nwhen ivory was not available.<br />\nThe exhibit is arranged<br />\nchronologically, starting with<br />\nEgypt and the ancient Near<br />\nEast. Among the earliest pieces<br />\nin the show are a group of<br />\nanimals and human figures<br />\nmade of hippoptamus teeth<br />\nfrom ancient Egypt. These<br />\nsmall figures may have had<br />\nmagical purposes or perhaps<br />\nserved as game tokens (about<br />\n4500 BC). There are also cosmetic containers, one in the<br />\nshape of a duck, and a cosmetic<br />\nspoon whose handle is in the<br />\nshape of a servant.<br />\nSeveral important pieces of<br />\nthe show were recently acquired<br />\nfrom the Fortress at Nimrud in<br />\nAssyria (9th and 8th centuries<br />\nBC). One is a thick plaque that<br />\n'depicts a cow nursing a suckling<br />\nIcalf, carved in high relief.<br />\nAnother is a thin plaque carved<br />\nin low relief that shows a griffin against the stylized branches<br />\nof a sacred tree.<br />\nThe Greek, Roman and<br />\nEtruscan Gallery includes a<br />\nwidely known chryselephantine<br />\n(ivory and gold)snake goddess<br />\nfrom Crete (16th Century BC),<br />\npossibly from the palace of<br />\nMinos at Knossos. One of the<br />\noutstanding Greek pieces is a<br />\nsmall Hellenistic head which<br />\nonly recently has been identified as Alexander the Great<br />\n(356-322 BC).<br />\nAmong these important pieces is a rare Egyptian box in the<br />\nHellenistic style, with inlaid<br />\nwax panels. The colors are still<br />\nintact, as is, surpisingly<br />\nenough, the box itself.<br />\nIn Eutruria (Italy), Etruscans<br />\ncombined Greek and Near<br />\nEastern influences to create<br />\ntheir own style. Unlike the<br />\nGreek ivory works, which were<br />\nreserved for the gods, most<br />\nEtruscan ivories were the personal possessions of the<br />\nwealthy. The rich tombs of<br />\nEtruria have yielded combs,<br />\ntools, plaques, appliques and<br />\nfinely carved boxes of ivory.<br />\nIn the Early and Byzantine<br /><br />\nTHI<br /><br />\nAt<br />\nthe ls<br />\nand t<br />\nPlay<br />\nfore(<br />\nsmall<br />\nafter<br />\nthere<br />\nthrot<br />\nfour<br />\nSatui<br />\n2:30<br />\ndent<br />\nThea<br /><br />\nCr<br />\nPretri<br />\nThe<br />\nIY fu<br />\nmorz<br />\nAme<br />\nCent<br />\nNov.<br />\n$9.0(<br />\nhour<br />\nthroi<br />\nMon<br />\nstud(<br />\ncall<br /><br />\nTI<br />\nThei<br />\nTray<br />\n\"twc<br />\ncom<br />\ninto<br />\nJewi<br />\nPark<br />\nOct.<br />\nCourtesy of Walters Art Gallery<br /><br />\nIvory Statuette from earl) 15th centur) Netherlands<br /><br />\ngallery there are many small<br />\ndevotional altarpieces in the<br />\nform of diptychs and triptychs.<br />\nBeside the usual subjects of the<br />\nCrucifixion, Virgin and Child,<br />\nand various saints, there are<br />\nseveral pieces which show the<br />\nByzantine interest in the pagan<br />\nart of the ancient world.<br />\nThe Walter's is especially<br />\nrich in works from the Middle<br />\nAges, when ivory became a<br />\nfashionable art medium. Paris<br />\ndeveloped as a center of a large<br />\nivory industry, producing<br />\nliturgical objects, church furnishings and accessories such as<br />\ncombs. The exhibition includes<br />\none of the earliest statues of the<br />\nMadonna and the Child in the<br />\nGothic style. Its strong angular<br />\ndrapery is similar to the stone<br />\nfigures at the Amiens Cathedral<br />\nand yet, it suggests a tenderness<br />\nbetween the figures.<br />\nOne of the most popular objects of the collection is a<br />\nGothic casket from Paris(14th<br />\ncentury) decorated with scenes<br />\nfrom Arthurian and other me-<br /><br />\ndieval romances.<br />\nThere are few Renaissance<br />\nivories because ivory lost its<br />\npopularity during this period,<br />\nbut the 17th century revived the<br />\ninterest with Baroque. Among<br />\nthe delicately detailed works in<br />\nthis section is a standing cup of<br />\nivory and silver gilt, depicting<br />\na banquet of the classical gods<br />\nand goddesses.<br />\nIn the 18th century, ivory<br />\nproduction was industrialized<br />\nfor the production of objects<br />\nlike snuff boxes, knife handles<br />\nand religious sculptures.<br />\nHenry Walters' 19th century<br />\nivories include the prizewinning Three Theological Virtues of 1857 by Moreau-Vauthier, and Louis Ernest Barrias'<br />\nexquisite Mysterious and Veiled<br />\nNature Reveals Herself Before<br />\nScience made of ivory and<br />\nmounted in gilded and oxidized<br />\nsilver (after 1899).<br />\nThe exhibit ends with a little<br />\nArt Nouveau jewelry, designed<br />\neon!, on p. 14<br /><br />\nBond is Back<br />\ncont. from p. II<br />\nWhile the movie is fun and<br />\nabsorbing, some of the fantasy<br />\nand excitement has gone out of<br />\nthe Bond adventures. For example, the movie pinpoints the<br />\nfact that Bond is growing old.<br />\nAnother disappointment is the<br />\nsurprisingly lousy musical score<br />\nand the total absence of the<br />\nBond theme music. Some of the<br />\nsupporting characters have also<br />\nundergone a change for the<br /><br />\nworse. Moneypenny,0,and Q<br />\nhave been replaced with younger and duller models. Although<br />\nthe new Q greets Bond's return<br />\nhappily (\"I hope now we'll<br />\nhave some gratuitous sex and<br />\nviolence\"), the new leader of<br />\nthe British Secret Service is<br />\ndistressingly scornful of espionage and of spies, in particular 007's.

St. Mary's<br />\nby Howard Bregman<br />\nIf there was anything anyone<br />\non the Hopkins women's tennis<br />\nteam could complain about last<br />\nweek, it was probably that the<br />\nseason to date had been too<br />\npredictable.<br />\nThe team's eight victories<br />\nhad all come easily, winning 68<br />\nand losing only four individual<br />\nmatches in those meets. Defeats<br />\nhad come at the hands of a<br />\nDivision I opponent, American<br />\nUniversity, and to perennial national contender Mary Washington. So, after practically<br />\nsweeping the state Division II<br />\nand III tournament last weekend and rolling over Franklin<br />\nand Marshall on Monday, the<br />\nJays predicted little competition<br />\nfrom Mt. St. Mary's, a team<br />\nthat finished a-distant second at<br />\nthe tournament.<br />\nWell, there's an awful cliche<br />\nthat has something to do with<br />\neggs and chickens, but it probably applies here. By a 5-4<br />\nscore, in a meet shortened by<br />\ndarkness, Mt. St. Mary's handed the Jays their third loss of<br />\nthe season. The team that could<br />\nonly win one first place trophy<br />\nat the state tournament made<br />\nsome key substitutions and beat<br />\nthe team that had won eight.<br />\nGranted, it was close. Frustra-<br /><br />\ntingly close. The meet was<br />\ndecided by a first doubles<br />\ntiebreaker in the third set,<br />\nwhich the Jays' Geraldine<br />\nKlauber and Ken i Fischer<br />\ndropped, 2-7.<br />\nThe week had started surprisingly well, with the team winning its second straight state<br />\ntournament. Dominating is a<br />\nbetter word against five other<br />\nMaryland teams(Towson State,<br />\nGoucher, Loyola, Frostburg<br />\nState, and Mt. St. Mary's), the<br />\nJays racked up 52 of a possible<br />\n54 points, taking first place at<br />\nevery .position except third<br />\nsingles. Mt. St. Mary's came in<br />\nsecond with 24 points.<br />\n\"We blew everyone away,\"<br />\nbeamed Coach Kay Fowler.<br />\n\"We really got a team feeling\u2014<br />\nii was a team victory. We have<br />\na feeling of how good we really are.\" Several squads, most<br />\nnotably UMBC and Salisbury<br />\nState, did not show up for the<br />\ntournament, but it would have<br />\nmade little difference.<br />\nKlauber, at first singles, beat<br />\nTina Pinnoci of Frostburg, 6-7,<br />\n6-1, 6-2 for the title. Fischer, at.<br />\nsecond singles, bested Amy<br />\nChambers of Mt. St. Mary's,<br />\n6-2, 6-4. Men -Jo Borzilleri, at<br />\nthird singles, took second place,<br />\nlosing in the final round to Jill<br />\nRafano of Mt. St. Mary's, 5-7,<br /><br />\n4-410407<br />\n,<br />\n01<br />\n,<br /><br />\nDave Simon<br /><br />\nThird singles player Men -Jo Borzilleri look second place in the state<br />\ntournament.<br /><br />\n1-6. At fourth, fifth, and sixth<br />\nsingles, Nina Urban, Kathy<br />\nMarch, and Monica Canilang<br />\nall won in straight sets.<br />\nOn Monday, at Homewood,<br />\nthe Jays faced a usually strong<br />\nFranklin and Marshall team,<br />\nand were mildly surprised after<br />\na 9-0 victory. \"If you had told<br /><br />\nBooters Lose Twice In Overtime<br />\nAmy Compton<br />\nIn their 'last two games<br />\nagainst Towson State and<br />\nSwarthmore, the Hopkins' soccer team has ended regular play<br />\nin a tie, and then lost in<br />\nOvertime.<br />\nLast Saturday the team<br />\ntraveled up,to Swarthmore. The<br />\ngame was scoreless until overtime play. Swarthmore netted a<br />\ngoal with only 15 seconds left<br />\nID t he first overtime half. They<br />\nwon the game 1-0. Statistics<br />\nshow JHU with three shots on<br />\ngoal, three corner kicks, and<br />\nthree saves for goalie Ray<br />\n'Giurceo. Swarthmore came<br />\naway with five shots on goal,<br />\nfive corner kicks, and two<br />\ngoalie saves.<br />\nWednesday evening Hopkins<br />\ntook on Towson under the<br />\nlights. Towson, a Division 1<br /><br />\nSteve Eisenberg<br /><br />\nRick de la Cruz and David Piaui<br />\nPractice for F&amp;M.<br /><br />\nteam, had a 9-1 record before<br />\nthe game. In addition to leading<br />\ntheir conference, Towson is<br />\nranked on the Eastern Seaboard.<br />\nHopkins scored the first goal<br />\nof the game. With an assist<br />\nfrom Kevin Howes, Danny<br />\nOlszewski sent .a beautiful shot<br />\nsailing over the Towson goalie's<br />\nhead to put JHU in the lead. It<br />\nwas ironic that Olszewski<br />\nscored Hopk in's goal since the<br />\nTowson head coach is his older<br />\nbrother. According to Danny<br />\n0, \"I've played against him<br />\nbefore. It's no big deal.\" The<br />\nfirst half ended with the score<br />\nat 1-0.<br />\nTowson scored once near the<br />\nend of the second half. It was<br />\nthe only other goal in regulation<br />\nplay, so the game continued<br />\nwith two 10 minute overtime<br />\nhalves to break the 1-1 tie. With<br />\nonly 30 seconds left in the first<br />\nhalf, Towson scored and went<br />\non to win the game 1-1.<br />\nThe statistics show how close<br />\nthe game was. Hopkins had<br />\nnine shots on goal, two corner<br />\nkicks, and 11 saves by Giuerceo. Towson had 11 shots, 71<br />\ncorners, and eight saves.<br />\nAccording to Coach Zimmerman,\"I couldn't be prouder of the way we played. We<br />\nwere mentally ready for this<br />\ngame. I think we caught them<br />\na little bit by surprise. The team<br />\nshould hold their heads up;<br />\nthey played their hearts out.\"<br />\n\"Towson's going home feeling lucky they beat us,\"<br />\nFullback Paul Miller said.<br /><br />\nThe team has four games<br />\nleft, and in Zimmerman's opinion, \"IF we play like we can<br />\nplay, we'll win all four.\" The<br />\nBlue Jays' next two challenges<br />\nwill both be home\u2014today<br />\nagainst F&amp;M and Wednesday<br />\nagainst Widener.<br /><br />\nme last spring that we would<br />\nbeat F&amp;M 9-0 this year, I would<br />\nhave laughed,\" said Fowler. In<br />\nthis meet, unlike some others,<br />\nthe breaks went Hopkins' way.<br />\nThe team won all three. tiebreakers t11 were played, and<br />\nended up winning every set of<br />\nthe meet, upping its season<br />\nrecord to 9-2.<br />\nOn Tuesday afternoon, a<br />\nconfident Fowler did not<br />\nhesitate to challenge the fates,<br />\nsaying, \"We will be 10-2 by<br />\ntomorrow.\" After the sweep of<br />\nthe state tournament, there was<br />\nno reason to doubt her prediction.<br />\nBut Mt. St. Mary's came<br />\nto Homewood with a few hidden cards. Sending its state<br />\ntournament third singles<br />\nchamp, Jill Rafano, to play<br /><br />\nfourth singles against Nina Urban, it brought in two players<br />\nagainst Borzilleri at third<br />\nsingles and March at fifth<br />\nsingles who had not played at<br />\nthe State's. Klauber and Fischer<br />\ntriumphed at first and second<br />\nsingles, 6-1, 6-0, and 6-4, 6-3,<br />\nrespectively, as they had done<br />\nlast weekend; but Borzilleri fell<br />\n3-6, 4-6, and March followed<br />\nsuit, 1-6, 5-7. Urban, who lost<br />\nher first set, 1-6, came back to<br />\nwin the second, 6-4, but fell in<br />\nthe last, 3-6. Canilang's 775, 6-4<br />\nvictory sent the teams into<br />\ndoubles play, tied at three matches apiece.<br />\nA powerful Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nthird doubles team overcame<br />\nHopkins' March and Julie<br />\nHorth, 4-6, 1-6. But Coach<br />\nFowler knew that at first and<br />\n,second doubles she faced a<br />\nrematch of the final round of<br />\nthe state tournament. She<br />\ncounted on a win from the<br />\npowerful team of Klauber and<br />\nFischer, who had disposed of<br />\ntheir opponents last Sunday,<br />\n6-4, 6-4. The pressure was on<br />\nBorzilleri and Urban to win<br />\nalso. Because of darkness, the<br />\nsecond dobules match could<br />\nonly go to one set. It was an<br />\neasy win for Borzilleri and Urban, 6-2. But Klauber and<br />\nFischer lost their first set, 4-6,<br />\nand after winning the second,<br />\n6-1, found themselves at 3-3 as<br />\nthe sun was taking its leave. A<br />\ntiebreaker was played, and<br />\nKlauber and Fischer found<br />\nthemselves at the short end of<br />\na 2-7 score-, while the Jays as a<br />\nteam were at the short end of<br />\na 5-4 meet.<br />\n\"We just blew it,\" said<br />\nFowler.<br />\nSo, at 9-3, the team finishes<br />\nits season this weekend with the<br />\nSalisbury State Invitaitional.<br /><br />\nLaxers Perfect For Fall Season<br />\nby David Brengel<br />\nThe men's lacrosse team<br />\noutlasted Mount Washington<br />\nClub, 14-12, last Thursday to<br />\nremain unbeaten, having previously defeated Loyola twice,<br />\nas well as the Hopkins' Alumni.<br />\nMount Washington jumped<br />\nout to a quick 5-0 lead within<br />\nthe first six minutes. Their giveand-go, fast-breaking offense<br />\nseemed to confuse the Blue<br />\n.lays' defense, which often left<br />\nmen, unmarked, in front of the<br />\ncrease. Goalie Larry Quinn<br />\nstarted for the Blue Jays, but<br />\nwas able to stop only one out<br />\nof the first six Mount Washington shots. Though the majority were point-blank, Coach<br />\nCiccarone decided to replace<br />\nhim with John Madden, figuring that Quinn had become<br />\nrattled.<br />\nIt wasn't until 9:50 of the<br />\nfirst quarter that the Blue Jays<br />\nwere able to score, with Willy<br />\nOdenthal getting an unassisted<br />\ngoal.

Seriousness is the key,\"<br />\nexplains Anderson, \"and their<br />\nwinning records are gaining<br />\nthem the respect needed for<br />\ncommitment.\"<br />\nThe women's program has<br />\ndeveloped a whole new pride<br />\njust over the past year. New<br />\nuniforms, team togetherness<br />\nand spirit, and a newly organized management system are part<br />\nof it. But the tennis team's 10-2<br />\nrecord and the field hockey<br />\nteam's 8-2 slate are the biggest<br />\nindicators.<br />\n\"The girls are making a<br />\nserious commitment by joining<br />\na winning team,\" according to<br />\nFowler. \"Practices are tough<br />\nand the time invested must be<br />\nproductive. As coaches, we can<br />\nnow start asking things of our<br />\nplayers and of the school.\"<br /><br />\nby Susan Fetterman<br /><br />\nGone are the days when a<br />\nvarsity sports team must scour<br />\nthe dorms for a girl to fill in just<br />\nbefore a match. Anderson and<br />\nFowler-Dressler hope tO also<br />\nmake the empty stands and losing records a thing of the past,<br />\ntoo. Practices are mandatory<br />\nand every sport emphasizes<br />\ngeneral fitness as well as<br />\nspecilized skills. Anderson<br />\nstresses that \"win or lose,<br />\nthere's enthusiasm. We've<br />\nupgraded the program and the<br />\nplayers can feel it.\"<br />\nIn addition to, ,a\u201e general<br /><br />\nFowler-Dressler believes that<br />\n\"our job now is to strengthen<br />\nall the women's teams. What<br />\nwe need mostly is support. The<br />\nathletes and teams have made<br />\nthe sacrifices. The rest of the<br />\nschool (faculty, fans, etc.) must<br />\nnow recognize that and lend a<br />\nhand.\" She wants this cooperation to extend to all areas of<br />\nsport. \"The classes taught here<br />\nshould be given credits toward<br /><br />\ngraduation. As with anything, a remarkable job. They have<br />\npeople need motivation and succeeded in turning their<br />\nright now, the sports classes are respective sports into MAC<br />\nplagued by a lack of commit- championship contenders.
