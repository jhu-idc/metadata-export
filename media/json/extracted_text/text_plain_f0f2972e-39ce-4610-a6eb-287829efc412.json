He<br />\nthen focused on the children of Lebanon and<br />\ntheir great role in truly liberating the country.<br />\nBrought up in a brutal generation, made into refugees and orphans, children suffer in a<br />\n\"world of bitterness\" never created by<br />\nthemselves. Ward described their childhood<br />\nas \"raw, overwhelming fear.\"<br />\nAll have suffered, he said. \"No words do<br />\ndefine the fear, anguish, and uncertainty of<br />\nthe future\" for them. Ward described many<br />\nas giving up, or being forced into malicious<br />\nservice. Others have become fanatics, simply because their inexperience and idealism \u2022<br />\nhave confused them.<br />\nStill, many young people love the country<br />\nand are weary of sectarianism, said Ward.<br />\n\"They want a Lebanese identity,\" he continued. What matters to them is who they are<br />\nas individuals. \"They want Lebanese to be<br />\nfirst, all else second,\" he said. \"The voices<br />\nare there, the dreams, hopes, and beliefs in<br />\na future are there.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn supporting his point that the youth hold<br />\nthe future of the country, Ward talked about<br />\nhis experiences with Lebanese baseball and<br />\nLebanon's Red Cross kids. He described<br />\nAmerican amateur baseball as \"win or else\"<br />\nand playing \"with a vengeance.\" He was not<br />\nvery successful his first time in trying to play.<br />\nIn the spring of 1986, he joined an amateur<br />\nLebanese baseball team, composed of beginners. Every Sunday morning, he would play.<br />\n\"There was something wonderful about the<br />\ngame\u2014emotional,\" he said. He said that the<br />\nkids did not count errors, but were out only<br />\nto have plain fun.<br />\n\"The youth of Lebanon has given me some<br />\nof the loveliest moments of my life,\" he said.<br />\nThey are a microcosm of the way Lebanon<br />\nused to be\u2014tolerant, forgiving, fun\u2014where<br />\nyoung men of all religions could get together<br />\nas \"friends and equals.\"<br />\nAccording to Ward, Lebanon's present condition can be overcome. \"The recognition of<br />\nfalsehoods on the field will be spread<br />\nthroughout the land,\" he said.<br />\nThe Red Cross kids are volunteers that<br />\nmarch to the latest disaster in Lebanon,<br />\ntwenty-four hours a day, explained Ward.<br />\nThey drive ambulances, gather the wounded,<br />\nand save lives. They also get killed. \"They're<br />\ncaught up in a mad world they aren't responsible for,\" he said. He also cited future uncertainty caused by a collapsed economy.<br />\n\"Why?\" asked Ward. \"Why do the Red<br />\nCross kids go out of their way for more<br />\ndanger? Why do they work with the elders,<br />\nrisk their lives, and outpour their love,<br />\ntenderness, and gentleness?<br />\n\"Because,\" Ward answered, \"they<br />\nbelieve, have hope, see a distant day when<br />\n<br />\npeace will come, when their country will be<br />\nwhole again. In every field, they will be<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nLebanon will never forget this nightmare,<br />\nsaid Ward. \"Too much has happened to<br />\nforget. But too much has happened not to<br />\nforgive.<br />\nDeeb described Lebanon as \"an experiment<br />\nin a liberal democracy\" from 1943 to 1975.<br />\nIt had free press, freedom of thought, and<br />\nother liberties. But now, he said, it has a<br />\n\"disparity of wealth.\"<br />\nSince 1975, freedoms have been curtailed<br />\ngradually, and setbacks in liberal democracy<br />\nhave occurred. \u2022<br />\nDeeb saw a tremendous effort to end the<br />\nwar, as well as a tremendous nostalgia for the<br />\nold times. Lebanon \"was known for an open<br />\nsociety before,\" he said. Now, it is \"impoverished by war. There's no reason to go<br />\non fighting.\" On the whole, he said, Lebanon<br />\nwill survive and progress. \"The future is promising,\" he concluded.<br />\nNaamani asked for a moment of silence<br />\nbefore proceeding to speak. He then described Ward's picture of Lebanese youth as accurate, and discussed the United States' role<br />\nas a host to knowledge-seeking Lebanese<br />\nyouth. \"They share liberty and democracy in<br />\nthe United States,\" he said. \"They have the<br />\nopportunity to excel in this academic<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\nHe said that the Lebanese are proud of their<br />\ntradition of liberty and dignity. \"It was our<br />\nway of life,\" he explained. The war only<br />\ncreates \"more problems, more tragedy,\" he<br />\nsaid, and the Lebanese \"will not forfeit their<br />\nrightful place in the region.\" Lebanon's<br />\nfuture, he concluded, looks bright.<br />\n<br />\nso that three sets of exams would<br />\nbe scheduled on one day, but that<br />\n\"student sentiment has been<br />\nagainst that.\"<br />\nStill, students are distressed at<br />\nthis semester's schedule. \"It's a<br />\nlittle difficult to make the transition from classes to exams if<br />\nthere's no way to recover,\"said<br />\none. Another was more blunt. \"It<br />\nsucks.\"<br />\nSenior Lora Sims, a member of<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, contended, \"The finals<br />\nschedule is a fiction. Exams are<br />\nbeing bumped up from the finals<br />\nschedule put out by the registrar.<br />\nFurthermore, many papers are<br />\ndue during the last week of<br />\nclasses or during the finals<br />\nperiod, and this creates enormous<br />\ndifficulties for the students.\"<br />\nShe added, \"Some professors<br />\nmay [also] be scheduling exams<br />\nfor their convenience in submitting grades.\"<br />\nAssociate Provost Stephen<br />\nMcClain said that all eight academic divisions of Hopkins operate on semesters of equal length.<br />\nHe noted, however, that the Arts<br />\nand Sciences and Engineering<br />\ndivisions present a special case<br />\nbecause their semester does not<br />\nrun into January.

Arkes is currently a professor at Amherst<br />\nCollege. His books include First<br />\nThings: An Inquiry Into the First<br />\nPrinciples ofMorals and Justice.<br />\nEach man presented his argument and then answered a variety of questions posed by the audience, which included professors<br />\nfrom the Department of Political<br />\nScience as well as a number of<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWalzer explained that although<br />\npresumption is generally in favor<br />\nof non-intervention, three cases<br />\nexist when intervention \"can be<br />\nlegitimately chosen as a moral<br />\noption.\"<br />\nHis first example of justifiable<br />\nintervention was that of a struggle against a colonial regime by<br />\na country claiming statehood. He<br />\n<br />\nexplained, \"Because the principle of non-intervention is to protect the integrity of the political<br />\ncommunity, [the first country]<br />\nhas no right to rule or oppress<br />\nothers.\"<br />\nWalzer argued that in this instance, military intervention must<br />\nbe a last resort in assisting the nation in its struggle for independence. He illustrated this<br />\npoint with the Algerian struggle<br />\nfor independence from the<br />\nFrench. \"It would have been<br />\njustifiable for Egypt to have sent<br />\nin soldiers to aid the F.L.A.,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThe second instance in which<br />\nWalzer perceived intervention to<br />\nbe morally acceptable is<br />\n\"counter-intervention\" by a third<br />\ncountry, when one country has<br />\nwrongly intervened in another<br />\ncountry's civil war. The purpose<br />\nof the involvement is to \"deliver<br />\nthe country where the war is being fought to the stronger side in<br />\nthe civil war.\" This example is<br />\nan instance in which \"might<br />\nmakes right\" from the standpoint<br />\nof an external observer. Using the<br />\nSpanish Civil War to illustrate<br />\nthis case, Walzer said that \"intervention [by the United States,<br />\nFrance and Britain] was<br />\njustifiable and perhaps 'morally<br />\nobligatory.'\"<br />\nThe systematic enslavement or<br />\nmassacre of a people by the<br />\ngovernment was the final<br />\njustifiable occassion advanced by<br />\nWalzer for military intervention.<br />\n<br />\nWalzer further argued that<br />\nhumanitarian ideals need not be<br />\nthe only motivation for<br />\nintervention.<br />\nArkes initially explained that<br />\n\"the principles of moral justice<br />\nare a subset of Kant's Laws of<br />\nFreedom.\" From this theory, he<br />\nreasoned that free elections and<br />\nconstitutional government are<br />\nquite important for a legitimate<br />\nregime.<br />\nArkes argued that the \"condition of autonomy also establishes<br />\nrestrictions on autonomy. . .<br />\n[One] can't create a right to do a<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\nwrong.\" He seemed to advocate<br />\nintervention on a much broader Professors Hadley Arkes and Michael Walzer addressed the issue of intervention in foreign countries in a forum Tuesday evening.<br />\nscope than Walzer.<br />\n<br />\nNapata insists Coca-Cola still<br />\ngenerates profits in South Africa<br />\nCOKE, from 6<br />\nwholesome share in the destiny of<br />\nSouth Africa.\"<br />\nNapata questioned how blacks<br />\nhad benefitted by the transfer of<br />\npower, outlining the process of<br />\nthis transfer.

The Course Guide was designed to<br />\nprovide information about the upcoming<br />\nsemester's class offerings in an attempt to aid<br />\nthe process of course selection.<br />\nUnfortunately, this semester's Guide is a little<br />\ndisappointing. For example, a number of major courses, like Molecular Cell Biology lecture, Organic Chemistry, Physiological Foundations and Contemporary American Letters<br />\n(CAL)are given no mention. There is not one<br />\nevaluation for any course offered by the German Department, yet there are ten such reviews<br />\nfor the Department of Hispanic and Italian<br />\nStudies' courses.<br />\nIdeally the Course Guide would be a comprehensive manual to which students could turn<br />\neach semester to find course evaluations and/or<br />\ndescriptions about nearly any class offered here.<br />\nInstead, the Guide provides only a random<br />\nsampling of evaluations; students are not likely to take the publication seriously if it is so<br />\ninconsistent.<br />\nThis is not the fault of the Course Guide staff.<br />\nThey've certainly put in many long, hard hours<br />\non this project, but are limited by the quality<br />\n<br />\nand number of evaluations they receive from<br />\nstudents each semester.<br />\nBoth students and instructors can benefit from<br />\na more solid Course Guide. Professors who<br />\nbelieve they offer high-quality courses should<br />\nencourage their students to fill out Course<br />\nGuide evaluations; they themselves should provide professor's statements about their courses.<br />\nSuch statements could provide information<br />\nabout the scope of the course as well as explain<br />\nthe level for which the course is geared. That<br />\nway, even students who are unfamiliar with the<br />\nprofessor or department can learn whether they<br />\nare qualified to take the course and if the<br />\nmaterial will interest them.<br />\nAn improved Course Guide could make the<br />\ncourse selection process more efficient and effective. We are fortunate to have a group of<br />\nCourse Guide staffers who are willing to put<br />\nthe publicaiton together each semester. But in<br />\norder for the Guide to become a solid, dependable resource, everyone must contribute.<br />\nRather than complain when another mediocre<br />\nCourse Guide appears this spring, fill out your<br />\nevaluations this week and wait for an improved Guide next semester.<br />\n<br />\nRemembering Dr. Bob<br />\nFriday, November 27 marked the passing of<br />\na wonderful man. Professor Bob Arellano of<br />\nthe Writing Seminars Department exuded a<br />\nwarmth and caring for undergraduates unique<br />\nat Homewood. No single professor helped as<br />\nmany Hopkins students; in addition no single<br />\nprofessor so dramatically was his department.<br />\nServing as advisor to Writing Sems majors<br />\nsince 1975, Bob advised practically every one<br />\nof the 110 or so undergrads in the department.<br />\nHis classes were extremely popular, in large<br />\nmeasure because students felt and appreciated<br />\nhis love of teaching.<br />\nBob's concern for undergrads reached<br />\nbeyond academics. Through his responsibilities<br />\nin Hopkins theater productions and coordinating<br />\nand sponsoring internships he extended his<br />\nwarmth and generosity to any student who approached him.<br />\nActively involved in student theater, Bob<br />\nlamented the inadequacies of the L/V Room and<br />\ntried for years to secure for it a decent sound<br />\n<br />\nsystem, sound insulation, even spotlights. His<br />\nefforts, however, went unrewarded. While<br />\nHomewood struggles with limited student union<br />\nspace, and we try to juggle events in the Glass<br />\nPavilion, L/V Room, and The Rathskellar, the<br />\nshortcomings of the L/V Room are that much<br />\nworse.<br />\nThe loss of Bob Arellano will be felt, albeit<br />\nin different ways, by everyone at Hopkins. It<br />\nwill be difficult for the Writing Seminars<br />\nDepartment to fill Bob's shoes and continue to<br />\ncare for each of its majors with the same devotion. Students who had yet to share a relationship, through a course or otherwise, with him<br />\nare missing a great experience.<br />\nPerhaps most importantly, his example of<br />\ndevotion and caring for undergrads and<br />\nHopkins can now only be a memory. We can<br />\nonly hope that this memory inspires more<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community to give as<br />\nselflessly as Bob gave.<br />\n<br />\nby A.

I know that I am generally too busy to look beyond my<br />\nshell here. However, a very important issue recently has been<br />\nthrust before me which has forced me to realize how fortunate I<br />\nam that my greatest problems are<br />\nrelatively insignificant and how<br />\npriviledged I am to have such<br />\neducational, professional and<br />\nreligious freedoms. This issue is<br />\none of human rights and<br />\nfreedoms.<br />\nWhen my parents visited the<br />\nU.S.S.R. last year, they met<br />\nmany Refusniks, Soviets who had<br />\nbeen denied exit visas. Every<br />\nRefusnik they met had been fired<br />\nfrom a job as a doctor, engineer,<br />\nprofessor, etc. and many had<br />\n<br />\nSee LETTERS, 10<br />\n<br />\nHe's almost gone!!!<br />\nof the most obnoxious attempts at<br />\nchintziness that I have ever seen.<br />\nFirst of all, Seilers was<br />\ndonating something like $4.00 for<br />\neach card turned in. This is bad<br />\nenough, seeing as how the day's<br />\nmeals were valued at around<br />\n$10.00. But the most amazing<br />\nthing was that Seilers coincidentally had chosen that night to be<br />\nSteak Night! Incredible. How<br />\namazing that they should serve<br />\nthe steak on the night when<br />\nalmost no one is eating!!! Talk<br />\nabout cheap! My God! And in addition, most of the freshmen who<br />\n'fasted' that day ended up eating<br />\nat the AMR snack bar, which is,<br />\nof course, run by Seilers! So who<br />\ncame out ahead that day? Oxfam?<br />\nDare I say \"Nay?\" This is it! I<br />\nam calling Mike Wallace.<br />\nWhat else have I learned at<br />\nHopkins? I have learned not to cut<br />\nacross Wyman Park on the way<br />\nback from the Rotunda. I did<br />\nonce, and saw strange people in<br />\nyellow hats doing even stranger<br />\nthings. I saw them and ran away.<br />\nLater that day I saw them again<br />\nwhile walking along University<br />\nParkway. They didn't even say hi<br />\nor anything.<br />\nI have learned not to insult my<br />\nesteemed ex-roommate and future<br />\nin<br />\nB<br />\nDoctor D<br />\nmy column, lest people make<br />\nendless fun of him. I have learned that to write an entire<br />\nphilosophy paper without the letter 'f' is possible if you are<br />\ncareful. I have learned recently<br />\nthat a Humanities Area Degree<br />\nand a token will get you a ride on<br />\nthe subway. I *have learned to<br />\nquote Woody Allen, that<br />\n\"Whosoever loveth wisdom is<br />\nrighteous but he that keepeth<br />\ncompany with fowl is weird.\"<br />\nThis indicates the end of my article, since I am running out of<br />\nthings to say.

If<br />\nI had been born in the U.S.S.R.<br />\ninstead of the U.S., then! might<br />\nbe making the same appeal to my<br />\nAmerican brothers and sisters to<br />\nspeak out for my rights.<br />\nPlease join me in marching for<br />\ntheir freedom on December 6.

Culp levels two accusations against the Oxfam relief<br />\norganization, both of which are<br />\nerroneous.<br />\nThe first issue is whether or not<br />\nOxfam has a political bias which<br />\ninterferes with its relief activities.<br />\nCulp concludes that because the<br />\n<br />\norganization opposed the U.S. invasion of Grenada, applauds the<br />\nprograms of Nicaragua's Sandinista government, and supports<br />\na nuclear freeze, that it has a<br />\npolitical agenda and cannot be<br />\ntrusted.<br />\nThe fact is, however, that these<br />\npositions and others held by Oxfam are the result of a concern for<br />\nthe realities of economic development, without regard for the<br />\ngeopolitical power struggle which<br />\nguides super-power foreign<br />\npolicy.<br />\nIt is no secret that unemployment doubled to 28 percent in<br />\nGrenada immediately after the<br />\nU.S. invasion, and is now hovering between 35 and 40 percent,<br />\nwhile the foreign debt has risen<br />\nto $50 million under the postinvasion government of Herbert<br />\nBlaize. These are genuine<br />\nobstacles to economic selfsufficiency and stability. As for<br />\nNicuaragua, the United Nations<br />\nhas also lauded the Sandinista's<br />\naccomplishments in areas such as<br />\nliteracy and health-care which are<br />\nrelevant to Oxfam's relief and<br />\ndevelopment mission. Even Oxfam's support for a nuclear freeze<br />\ndoes not demosntrate a bias<br />\ntoward capitalism or communism, simply a realization of<br />\nthe fact that a freeze today would<br />\nsave $400,000,000,000 (trillion)<br />\nby the year 2000 for the U.S.<br />\nalone, money which could, in the<br />\nopinion of Oxfam, be put to much<br />\nbetter use. Indeed, the fact that<br />\nOxfam operates in right-wing<br />\nstates such as El Salvador and in<br />\nleft-wing states like Mozambique<br />\nshows clearly that their true concern is human life and not<br />\npolitical affiliation.<br />\n<br />\nCulp's second accusation, that<br />\nlittle of the money donated actually contributes to relief efforts, is<br />\neven more clearly false. With administrative costs at less than 8<br />\npercent of the annual budget, and<br />\nover 70 percent of funds going to<br />\ndirect aid, Oxfam is the envy of<br />\nnon-profit relief organizations.<br />\nChris Culp's \"propagandistic<br />\nillusion\" is his own. Oxfam is<br />\namong the most widely respected<br />\nof international organizations,<br />\nand deserves our support and<br />\nadmiration.<br />\nJay Kaufman<br />\n<br />\nIncompetent Writing<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThroughout this past fall, the<br />\nNews-Letter's sportswriting has<br />\nbeen simply atrocious. I am referring, specifically, to the<br />\n\"writing\" of Jonathan Missner in<br />\nhis football articles.<br />\nMy guess is that this man never<br />\nattended a single football game.<br />\nHe had an entire week to write an<br />\narticle, and consistantly came up<br />\nwith a cheap synopsis of the Sunday Baltimore Sun article (which<br />\nwas never very good to begin<br />\nwith).<br />\nAll Jon had to do is ask the<br />\nAthletic Center for statistics and<br />\ntake an hour to interview a couple of players. With the ongoing<br />\nattempts to get this campus involved in Hopkins athletics, the<br />\nNews-Letter should feel ashamed<br />\nfor allowing a \"sportswriter\" to<br />\nembarass them as Missner did in<br />\nhis articles.<br />\nA prime example of Jon's ineptitude was his \"grande finale\"<br />\nabout the Western Maryland<br />\ngame. In this final article he<br />\n<br />\nshould have, at the very least,<br />\ntalked to some of the seniors who<br />\nhad just played the last football<br />\ngame of their lives. Instead, he<br />\nchose to paraphrase the Baltimore<br />\nSun's article. The rifle team<br />\nreceived more coverage this<br />\nweek!<br />\nI realize the team was only 4-6,<br />\nbut they were much better than<br />\ntheir record indicated. The team<br />\ndeserved more than the lame<br />\nNews-Letter gave them.<br />\nWhen a person takes on a<br />\nresponsbility such as writing for<br />\nthe major fall sport, he has to put<br />\nmore than twenty minutes a week<br />\ninto writing the article. Hopkins<br />\nfootball should have been receiving headlines all season, but instead closed out the year on the<br />\nbottom of the page (under the rifle article!?).<br />\nI feel Missner owes the football<br />\nteam, especially the seniors, an<br />\napology for his lack of writing<br />\nability. The saddest part is that it<br />\nis too late for these seniors who<br />\nhave lost out to Jon's<br />\nincompetence.<br />\nTom Loftus<br />\nJohn Pattaras<br />\n<br />\nShowing Support<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the years from 1933 to 1939,<br />\nover 3 million people requested<br />\npermission to leave their<br />\nhomeland.

Later, it was confirmed that over twice that<br />\nnumber were murdered because<br />\nthey were Jews.<br />\nIn 1987 over 400,000 people<br />\nhave requested permission to<br />\nemigrate from a country which<br />\n<br />\nA Bit More<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe most<br />\nfew hours<br />\nyou'llspend allweek.<br />\nRun.

Well, for the past<br />\nthirty years, the Hopkins Tutoring Service has been supplying<br />\nthe Baltimore City area with enthusiastic ones. The tutors are all<br />\nvolunteers and the program is<br />\ncoordinated by Senior Paul Swanson and Junior Lynn Thomas on<br />\nMondays and Wednesdays, and<br />\nby Liz VanAmerongen, who is<br />\nthe full time director of the tutoring project, on Tuesdays and<br />\nThursdays.<br />\n\"One of the biggest bonuses of<br />\nthe program is that it's one on<br />\none,\" said Swanson, who is also<br />\nthe housemaster of Baker. He<br />\nbelieves that this changes the<br />\nchild's attitude toward learning,<br />\nmaking it \"more positive. \u2014 This,<br />\nhe adds, \"will have long term effects.\"<br />\nSwanson said that the best thing<br />\nabout the program is that it's free<br />\nfor the children. \"It's rare to have<br />\nthat. It makes the program very<br />\nspecial.\" He described the Tutoring Service as being \"fortunate\"<br />\nthat the University and the Urban<br />\nServices agency, a federally<br />\nsponsored service, support it.<br />\nThe University offers financially strong support to the tutoring<br />\nservice, and hires people to buy<br />\ngames and supplies. The Tutoring Service also sets up many<br />\nspecial events through the<br />\n<br />\nUniversity. For example, there<br />\nwas a Halloween party this year<br />\nfor the children that was sponsored by the Office of Residential Life. There was also a field<br />\ntrip, where tutors and their tutees<br />\nwent roller-skating together.<br />\nEvery semester there is a<br />\ngraduation ceremony for the kids.<br />\nKurt Schmoke, current mayorelect, as well as Parren Mitchell,<br />\na former senator from Baltimore,<br />\nspoke at a graduation a couple<br />\nyears ago. The Tutoring Service<br />\nhopes to have senators Sarbanes<br />\nand Mikulski speak in the future.<br />\nTutors and their tutees spend an<br />\nhour and a half a day together,<br />\ntwo days a week. A bus picks up<br />\nthe kids, who all live in basically<br />\nthe same neighborbhood. Then<br />\nthey go with their tutors to study<br />\nin any available classrooms, the<br />\nglass pavilion, or anywhere else<br />\non campus. \"The kids are pretty<br />\nyoung, between the ages of six<br />\nand twelve,\" said Swanson.<br />\nTherefore, the tutoring involves<br />\nmostly remedial math and<br />\nreading.<br />\nOne day a semester there is a<br />\n\"reverse-session.\" Tutors get on<br />\na van and go to their tutees'<br />\nhouses for the regualr session. It<br />\nopens up the tutors eyes to where<br />\ntheir students live and the situation at home. \"It's good to get the<br />\nflavor for it,\" said Swanson, but<br />\non the whole, the reverse-session<br />\n\"isn't very productive.\" Kids are<br />\n<br />\nbusy showing off their houses and<br />\nintroducing their family, he said.<br />\nParents usually hear about the<br />\nprogram from other parents or<br />\nthe school refers them, although<br />\nright now there's a six month<br />\nwaiting list. On the whole, most<br />\nparents are interested. \"They<br />\ncare enough to sign their kids<br />\nup,\" said Swanson.<br />\nAnd what do the tutors have to<br />\nsay? \"My kid is my friend,\"<br />\nasserted Betsey Wadsworth, a<br />\nfreshman who tutors 13 year old<br />\nBryan Shaffer. \"I'm interested in<br />\nwhat he does later. We get along<br />\nwell,\" she added, \"and he's a<br />\nreally good kid, a sharp kid. He<br />\nwants to go to Duke to play<br />\nbasketball.\"<br />\nJohn McGready, whose first<br />\nregular tutee dropped out of the<br />\nprogram, now teaches as a<br />\nsubstitute tutor. \"I enjoy doing<br />\nit,\" he said. \"It makes me happy. I think I learn more from<br />\nthem than they do from me.\"<br />\nMcGready meets many children<br />\nand has gained \"a whole new<br />\nperspective.\" He added, \"The<br />\nkids are psyched to get attention,<br />\nbut their behavior is usually<br />\ngood.\"<br />\nWadsworth said, \"When<br />\nthey're excited about something,<br />\nthey work really hard on it.\"<br />\nSince she missed the rollerskating field day, she spent all of<br />\nSaturday with her tutee. \"It was<br />\ntotal fun,\" she said.

It has proven to be a learning experience<br />\nfor everyone involved.<br />\nenjoyed the field trip. \"I was impressed by how good the kids<br />\nwere and how bad I was. I got a<br />\nlot of sore spots.\"<br />\nWhat do Wadsworth and<br />\nMcGready think it takes to do the<br />\njob? \"It involves a lot of commit-<br />\n<br />\nment,\" said Wadsworth.<br />\nMcGready cited the three hours<br />\nper week plus preparation. \"It<br />\ntakes time and patience,\" he added. \"You've got to be ready to<br />\ndeal with frustration and disappointment, as well as happiness.\"<br />\n<br />\nHuman rights rally trip planned<br />\nhave been working together to in- of the area Universities including<br />\nform the Hopkins community Hopkins, believes we should care<br />\nabout the terrible human rights for our fellow people and we<br />\nQuestion 1: Have you seen the<br />\nviolations that are taking place in should be able to \"positively<br />\nbright yellow posters plastered all<br />\nthe Soviet Union.

I speak<br />\nof the recently reinstated Student<br />\nConcert Committee. They have<br />\ntreated you to a sudden but<br />\nwelcome influx of big jazz names<br />\nand underground punk favorites.<br />\nThe outstanding motivational<br />\nand organizational force behind<br />\nthe SCC is Jeff Holmes, a junior.<br />\nLast December, the Student Activities Council decided to bring<br />\nthe SCC back after its five year<br />\nabsence from the JHU musical<br />\nscene. Jeff was appointed to the<br />\n<br />\nposition of Committee Head.<br />\nAlthough he had neither a budget<br />\nnor a committee to lead, his<br />\ntireless work with promoter Don<br />\nWayner succeeded in bringing<br />\nSuzanne Vega, Pat Metheny, Nils<br />\nLofgren (Bruce Springsteen's<br />\nguitarist), and the Smithereens to<br />\na music-bare Homewood campus. In this semster alone, the<br />\nHoodoo Guru's, 10,000 Maniacs<br />\n(their music is as colorful as their<br />\nname), and Don Dixon and Marti Jones have graced Shriver Hall.<br />\nOn December 10, JHU will host<br />\nthe legendary fusion-jazz guitarist<br />\nAl Dimeola. Tickets are only<br />\n$7.50 at the Levering Box Office,<br />\nif you show your ID.<br />\nAnd if you don't show your<br />\n<br />\nID'? Then you pay the normal<br />\n$10.50. \"Hopkins students get a<br />\ndiscount,\" says Jeff. \"The 3<br />\ndollars you aren't paying is what<br />\nit would have cost the promoter<br />\nto rent Shriver. But we get it free,<br />\nbecause we are a student<br />\norganization. We should take<br />\nmore advantage of that.\" He<br />\nrefers to the fact that not enough<br />\ncollege students attend these performances, so that most tickets<br />\nare sold to local Baltimoreans. Of<br />\ncourse, there is nothing wrong<br />\nwith locals attending, but as Jeff<br />\nsays, \"It would be much better to<br />\nhave college concerts, with<br />\nstudents from Goucher, Towson<br />\nState, and Loyola converging on<br />\nHomewood.\" The SCC is in<br />\n<br />\nNuts: Good fodder for TV<br />\nNUTS<br />\nProduced by Barbara Streisand<br />\nDirected by Martin Ritt<br />\nby Sandrine Tiller<br />\nNuts is a forgettable movie. It's<br />\nnice. It's okay, not one you walk<br />\nout of wincing, but not one you<br />\nthink about afterwards.<br />\nEverything in this film is spelled out. You can work out the<br />\nplot, the characters, and the ending quite easily.<br />\nBarbara Streisand is Claudia<br />\nDraper, a woman accused of first<br />\ndegree manslaughter. She is also<br />\na high-class hooker, an ill mannered wisecracker, and just about<br />\nto be put away for years into a<br />\npsychiatric hospital. Her parents<br />\nare upper-middle class \"people<br />\nwho care,\" who want her to be<br />\ndeclared incompetent to stand<br />\ntrial, so as to be saved the embarassment. In a back-handed<br />\nway, Claudia and Aaron Levinsky (Richard Dreyfuss) get<br />\ntogether to declare her competen-<br />\n<br />\ncy in a hearing. Levinsky is a<br />\nman with integrity, ideals, and a<br />\ngood sense of humor.<br />\nOf course Claudia is sane, in<br />\nfact she is saner than anybody<br />\nelse is. In between the courtroom<br />\nscenes, we are shown glimpses of<br />\nClaudia's former life: her<br />\nchildhood, her work as a hooker,<br />\nand the way the crime really happened. These provide good<br />\nbackground while we watch<br />\nClaudia and Levinsky battle an<br />\nunscrupulous lawyer, an incompetent psychiatrist, and the<br />\noverbearing parents.<br />\nAlthough this is based on a true<br />\nstory, the plot is handled in a very<br />\nfacile way. The characters are<br />\none-dimensional, their motives<br />\nare plain and simple. Often the<br />\nmovie drags. The courtroom<br />\nscenes (how many more courtroom movies must we sit<br />\nthrough?) are slow and<br />\nremarkably inconclusive. Streisand's obnoxiousness relieves the<br />\nboredom in parts, but her<br />\nmoralizing is old and thinly<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\n<br />\nFilm<br />\nWeekend Wonderflix presents<br />\ndisguised.

He exercises this control<br />\nover the character of Peter (Jordan Karp), a man of \"enviable innocence.\" Jerry approaches Peter<br />\none day in the park in hopes of<br />\ngetting \"to know somebody,<br />\nknow all about him.\" Peter accepts Jerry, embarking in an<br />\nenlightening conversation concerning Jerry's alienation, and eventually becomes the object of<br />\nJerry's obsessive search for<br />\ncompanionship.<br />\nPiccinini is unforgettable as the<br />\ndisturbed Jerry, a character who<br />\nreaches out to the suburbanized<br />\nPeter in a final attempt to<br />\neliminate his loneliness. Jerry<br />\ndominates the weak-willed Peter,<br />\nfirst verbally with his provocative<br />\nquestions, and later by physical-<br />\n<br />\nly pushing him off the bench<br />\nwhich the two occupy. Piccinini's<br />\nconstant movements and<br />\nmesmerizing stage voice convey<br />\nhis urgent need for fellowship.<br />\nKarp, although his character<br />\nseemed too dazed rather than<br />\nshocked by Jerry at the play's<br />\nopening, reacted wonderfully to<br />\nPiccinini as the show progressed.<br />\nJerry tells the story of his encounters with a dog in his boardinghouse and his attempts to<br />\nbreach the gap of his alienation<br />\nthrough this dog. \"Animals are<br />\nindifferent to me like people. . .<br />\nBut this dog wasn't indifferent.\"<br />\nWhen his efforts fail, Jerry claims<br />\nthat he and the dog \"neither love<br />\nnor hate because [they] don't try<br />\nto reach each other.\" Throughout<br />\nthe play, Peter responds with<br />\neither disinterest or understandable shock, and thus makes the<br />\ndisarming character of Jerry<br />\nbelievable to the audience. Both<br />\nmen, intriguing as well as terrifying, are well cast together and<br />\nmaintain a suitable pace for the<br />\none-act play.<br />\nDespite a distracting and rather<br />\nbloody special effect, the Writing<br />\nSeminars production was entertaining and thought-provoking.<br />\nPiccinini and Karp's performances were convincing and truly memorable.

Stewart<br />\nNovels, novellas, poetry collections, biographies. A month or<br />\ntwo ago, the News-Letter ran a<br />\nreview of a different sort of book.<br />\nIt's a relatively new genre in<br />\nAmerica but one that is growing<br />\nat a rapid pace. It's called the<br />\ngraphic novel, a sort of extension<br />\nof the Big Little Book comic strip<br />\ncollections popular in the Forties<br />\nand Fifties. Instead of a series of<br />\nperipherally connected strips or<br />\nstories, the graphic novel concentrates on creating a longer continuity, more closely resembling<br />\nits prose equivalent. \"Comics can<br />\nbe serious\" is quickly becoming<br />\na cliche amongst enthusiasts. The<br />\nsurprising trend that undercuts<br />\nthis belief is that more and more<br />\ncomics are becoming less and less<br />\ncomic-like. It is the serious<br />\nwriters who are advancing the<br />\nfield. Take for example American<br />\nnovelist Jerome Charyn, author<br />\nof Paradise Man and The Man<br />\nWho Grew Younger. He recently<br />\ncollaborated with French artist<br />\nFrancois Boucq, to write The<br />\nMagician's Wife, an awardwinning graphic novel. Alas, the<br />\nmajority of comics found on the<br />\nracks in drug stores are still as insipid and juvenile as they have<br />\never been, perhaps more so.<br />\nSaga of the Swamp Thing, by<br />\n<br />\nAlan Moore, Stephen Bissette,<br />\nand John Totleben, is one of the<br />\nmore wonderful examples of the<br />\nform's new maturity. Originally<br />\na mid-line horror title, the volume<br />\nis a collection of reprints from the<br />\nfirst six bi-monthly issues<br />\n(#21-27) featuring Moore and his<br />\nteam. Of these six, two stories are<br />\ndeveloped. The first concerns the<br />\nSwamp Thing himself. According<br />\nto the origin laid down by Len<br />\nWein and Berni Wrightson in<br />\n1972, a young scientist, Alec<br />\nHolland, was in the midst of<br />\ndeveloping a \"bio-restorative\"<br />\nformula, designed to encourage<br />\nthe growth of plant life, when a<br />\nbomb went off in the lab and hurled him, body ablaze, into the<br />\nwaters of a nearby swamp.<br />\nInstead of dying, he was<br />\ntransformed by the formula into<br />\na plant-like creature, a ridiculous<br />\nexplanation but one we've come<br />\nto expect from kid's comics. In<br />\nhis first issue as writer (\"The<br />\nAnatomy Lesson\"), Moore surprises us by raising this very<br />\npoint. Then, without changing<br />\nany of the facts (a no-no in the<br />\ncontinuity-minded universe of<br />\nD.C. Comics), he offers a different, almost plausible explanation for Alec Holland's condition,<br />\none that has the ring of true scientific discovery. It would lessen<br />\nthe impact to explain exactly what<br />\nthat discovery is. Suffice to say<br />\nthat it makes for a startling opening. Moore presents the foundations upon which the story is based and then tears them out from<br />\n<br />\nunder.<br />\nAs masterful as the plot and<br />\nwriting are, a graphic novel is only half complete without the artwork. Stephen Bissette and John<br />\nTotleben were already versed in<br />\nthe ways of horror comics before<br />\njoining the creative team of<br />\nSwamp Thing. Both worked on<br />\nMarvel's Bizarre Adventures as<br />\nwell as a number of underground<br />\ncomics. In Swamp Thing, they<br />\nwork to create a thick gumbo of<br />\nvisuals. Set in the Bayou of Louisiana, the pictures are filled with<br />\nthe overflowing fertility of the<br />\nswampland. Each frame is<br />\ncrammed with detail, the intense<br />\nlinework sometimes threatening<br />\nto overwhelm the picture's subject. To add to this feeling of confusion and uneasiness, Bissette<br />\narranges the panels in overlapping, non-symmetrical patterns,<br />\nusing imperfect square and rectangular frames to distort and<br />\ndisorient the page. But the arrangements are not random. Each<br />\nis designed to amplify the scene<br />\nit is depicting. At their best,<br />\nBissette and Totleben generate a<br />\nsense of motion that drives the<br />\nstory, with all its weight, forward. There are moments when<br />\nMoore's prose begins to verge into poetic territory. Fortunately,<br />\nMoore seems aware of this<br />\ntendency and is careful to match<br />\nthe image closely to the words,<br />\nmaking sure that one supports the<br />\nother. On the whole, he is successful. And there are some who<br />\nwould argue that the poetry is<br />\n<br />\noften integral to the story's mood<br />\nand certainly to illustrating the<br />\nmain<br />\ncharacter's<br />\ngentle<br />\npersonality.<br />\nThe character of the Swamp<br />\nThing is at once human, natural,<br />\nbelievable, and fantastic. Moore<br />\nunderstands very well how the<br />\nvarious aspects of his character<br />\nconnect and he connects them expertly. The relationship between<br />\nAlec (the name he still goes by)<br />\nand his human friend, Abigail<br />\nCable, is an entirely natural one.<br />\nShe doesn't see him as a monster<br />\nand after a while, neither do we.<br />\nAlec's form is certainly unusual<br />\nenough so that we don't mistake<br />\nhim for human, and yet we can't<br />\nreally say he's anything less. Indeed, as the story progresses, we<br />\ndiscover just how extra-human he<br />\nis.<br />\nThe second half of this volume<br />\nis devoted to what has become<br />\nknown as the \"Monkey King\"<br />\ntrilogy. It is composed of three<br />\nstories: \"The Sleep of Reason,\"<br />\n\"A Time of Running,\" and \"By<br />\nDemons Driven.\" This is where<br />\nthe book begins to live up to its<br />\nhorror classification. The story<br />\nline concerns the summoning of<br />\na special kind of demon\u2014one that<br />\neats, inspires, and kills with fear.<br />\nLike Orwell's Room 101, the<br />\ndemon, named the Monkey King,<br />\nhas the ability to know what<br />\ncauses an individual's greatest<br />\nfear and assume its form. Set<br />\nloose in a school for autistic<br />\nchildren, the creature plays on the<br />\nkids' terror, feeding on them un-<br />\n<br />\ntil the Swamp Thing and classic<br />\nD.C. anti-hero, Etrigan, the<br />\nDemon, intervene. In what may<br />\nbe the most terrifying two pages<br />\nin comics, Moore and company<br />\ncatalog, in words and pictures,<br />\nthe deepest and darkest fears of<br />\nthese\u2022 autistic children. What<br />\nmakes that so awful is that the<br />\nsource of these fears is not fantasy, but reality; their reality,<br />\ndistorted and enhanced by imagination. In one panel, the<br />\nMonkey King is shown in the<br />\nform of a young girl's molesting<br />\nfather, slurring the words,<br />\n\"Mommy needn't know\" over<br />\nand over.<br />\nAs scary as all this becomes,<br />\nMoore doesn't let it get out of<br />\nhand. He manages to inject just<br />\nenough humor to keep things<br />\nbalanced out. The scenario involving the attic insulation<br />\nsalesman, the stuffed swordfish,<br />\nand Selen's decision not to buy<br />\nthe lawn furniture is hilarious. (If<br />\nthat doesn't spur your interest,<br />\nnothing will.)<br />\nSince leaving Swamp Thing,<br />\nMoore has gone on to do other<br />\nprojects. Most important of these<br />\nis the 384 page epic, Watchmen,<br />\nalso put in paperback by Warner<br />\nBooks. In an interview, Moore<br />\ndescribed it as the comics<br />\nequivalent to Pynchon's Gravity's<br />\nRainbow.<br />\nGraphic novels still have a long<br />\nway to go if they are to fulfill<br />\ntheir potential, but efforts like<br />\nthese are strong, sure steps in the<br />\nright direction.<br />\n<br />\nSilence's furious melancholy<br />\nby John Galotto<br />\nMadison S. Bell writes to<br />\ndevastate. If you've been feeling<br />\npretty well-integrated with your<br />\nenvironment lately, Bell's new<br />\nnovel, A Year ofSilence, will hit<br />\nyou like a bucket of ice-cold<br />\nwater.<br />\nA Year ofSilence is a powerful<br />\nreminder of the frailty of human<br />\nexistence, expressed ultimately<br />\nby the suicide of its main<br />\ncharacter. The book features a<br />\nparade of desperate people, most<br />\nof whom lack any sense of selfimportance. The scary thing is,<br />\nthese characters are not<br />\nvagabonds; they are young,<br />\ncollege-educated urbanites who<br />\nshould by integrated into society<br />\n\u2014but are in fact on the margin.<br />\nBell focuses on a young woman<br />\nnamed Marian, who is living in<br />\nNew York working as an illustrator for children's books.<br />\nShe is unmarried and unsatisfied<br />\nwith her boyfriend; she is planning for what will be her fourth<br />\nabortion. She is impulsive but<br />\nbored, and she drinks and does a<br />\nlot of drugs. Her personal<br />\ndevelopment is stultifying; she<br />\nhas no love, no enthusiasm, she<br />\nis seemingly without career ambition and without family ties.<br />\nMarian has no connections to the<br />\nworld; she is an existential free-<br />\n<br />\nfloater.<br />\nBell forces us to think about the<br />\nnature of existence; Marian's<br />\n(and the other characters' as well)<br />\nalienation is not easily written off<br />\nas spoiled-child syndrome (Bret<br />\nEaton Ellis) or pure selfabsorption (Jay McInerney). Bell<br />\ndoes not give enough details<br />\nabout her life to allow that; we<br />\nmust view her plight as proceeding directly frqm the<br />\nloneliness of human existence.<br />\nThe epigraph to A Year of<br />\nSilence is a quote from a Camus<br />\nessay: \"II faut imaginer Sisyphe<br />\nheureux. (Sissyphus must have<br />\nbeen happy.\" By alluding to<br />\nSissyphus at the outset, Bell<br />\nplaces the reader in the fatalist<br />\nframe of mind; as we read about<br />\nthe lives of Marian and her acquaintences, we can only think of<br />\nSissyphus, alone, rolling the rock<br />\nup that hill, just to see it roll back<br />\ndown again.<br />\nThe structure of the book is<br />\nsymmetrical. Focusing around<br />\nMarian's suicide, Bell spends half<br />\nthe book moving towards it and<br />\nhalf the book moving away from<br />\nit. The narrative is developed<br />\nthrough a series of vignettes, each<br />\nof which has a different perspective on Marian's life. To see<br />\nMarian as a supporting player in<br />\nother people's lives is fascinating,<br />\nand Bell pulls it off beautifully.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the technique is effective only up to a certain point;<br />\nwhen Bell starts taking the firstperson voice for old ladies and<br />\nbeggars, he compromises a good<br />\npart of his artistic integrity. One<br />\nparticularly nettlesome chapter<br />\nfeatures a phone soliloquy: A<br />\nbored and uninteresting woman<br />\n(Crystal) yaks for ten pages, completely uninterrupted by Sid, who<br />\nis probably asleep on the other<br />\nend.<br />\nAlthough<br />\nCrystal's<br />\nmonologue sheds some light on<br />\nMarian, Bell's gimmicky presentation ridicules her voice, and<br />\nundermines its contribution to the<br />\noverall picture.<br />\nIt is only in a few chapters that<br />\nBell compromises the unity of the<br />\npicture. For the most part, Bell's<br />\nconstruction is coherent and his<br />\nstyling is exquisite. We see<br />\nMarian through the eyes of her<br />\nlover (Weber), her best friend<br />\nGwen, Weber's friends, and<br />\nother miscellaneous bystanders.<br />\nThese different perspectives contribute to an understanding of<br />\nemptiness in the wake of death,<br />\nand they also illustrate the emptiness that presages death. Most<br />\nof the characters, like Marian,<br />\nlead bleak lives. For instance,<br />\nthere is Sinclair, Weber's friend,<br />\nwho is lonely and seeking a relationship. Bell captures the exaltation Sinclair feels at the prospect<br />\n<br />\nof seeing Gwen, whom he met at<br />\nMarian's funeral:<br />\n\"It was wrong, completely inappropriate, but he felt very happy, couldn't remember when he'd<br />\nfelt so good; it was like coming<br />\nout of hibernation. He raised his<br />\nhand and flexed its fingers in the<br />\nsunlight, wondering at the intricacy of their movement.'Why,<br />\nit's just that we're still alive,' he<br />\nthought, regaining the words of<br />\nthe answer now. 'That's all that's<br />\nwrong with us.'\"<br />\nUnfortunately, Sinclair's joie<br />\n.de vivre wears off quickly. He<br />\nand Gwen are lovers for about a<br />\nyear afterward, until Gwen gets<br />\nbored and blows him off. Gwen<br />\nbids him farewell in a diner over<br />\na cup of coffee, and then bolts out<br />\nthe door; Sinclair sits and stares<br />\nin shock, like Sissyphus watching<br />\nthc rock roll down the hill.<br />\nBell is perhaps at his strongest<br />\nin the first chapter, which<br />\ndescribes Weber's roommate,<br />\nLarkin. Emptiness and silence<br />\nseem to come to a symbolic<br />\ncrescendo with Larkin, a pianist<br />\nwho plays not a piano but a piece<br />\nof wood. As a virgil to his brother<br />\nwho has disappeared and is probably dead. Larkin practices for<br />\nhis upcoming concert on a<br />\nwooden board:<br />\n<br />\n\"At ease then, Larkin accomplished the lingering twentyfifth, the climax of the minor<br />\nvariations. During the long rest at<br />\nthe end of it he heard what he'd<br />\nbeen half consciously waiting for:<br />\na cascade of notes tumbling out<br />\ninto the air, real sound complete<br />\nwith its declining echo. He let the<br />\npause hang longer. It was an illusion, sure enough, compounded of his fatigue and the tingling<br />\nin his fingertips, the latter of a<br />\ntactile reminiscence of the plucked clusters of a harpsicord. Unshaken, he commenced the first<br />\nof the five final variations, sensing the music in all its particulars<br />\nas it came carved out of its own<br />\ndeepest silence.\"<br />\nThis remarkable passage encapsulates Bell's devastating ambivalence. There is transcendence, but it is illusory, squeezed from the fibers of a wooden<br />\nboard. Larkin pounds the keys<br />\nfuriously, but makes no noise, except for that in his own head.<br />\nBell's message is clear: When<br />\npeople cannot ring out their own<br />\ntranscendent chimes in the face of<br />\ntriviality, cannot adhere to higher<br />\nunities (love, ambition), they exist with the autonomy of a block<br />\nof wood. And they are not very<br />\nhappy.<br />\n<br />\n\f18/DECEMBER 4, 1987<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 If You Stay Put<br />\non<br />\nDecember 6th<br />\nSo Might<br />\nThousands<br />\nof Soviet Jews<br />\nBuses leave MSE Library at 10<br />\na.m., return at 5:30.

It was entitled \"88<br />\nreasons to see the O's,\" or<br />\nsomething like that, but though it<br />\nwas mildly amusing, it reminded<br />\nme that there are still a number<br />\nof things the Orioles need to do<br />\nto get back into contention. My<br />\nlist, which may still be incomplete, goes like this:<br />\n1) Deal away Mike Boddicker.<br />\nI have been convinced for a<br />\nnumber of years now that Boddicker is a master con artist, a<br />\nman who makes people believe<br />\nthat he's more of a pitcher than<br />\nhe really is. Every year people<br />\ntalk about his flashes of brilliance<br />\nand ignore the fact that he has<br />\nzero natural talent. It takes a<br />\nwhile, but after he has a hot start<br />\nin the spring, the rest of the<br />\nleague catches up to him. In 1985<br />\nand 1986 combined, for example,<br />\nhe went 3-13 after August 1. And<br />\n1987 was no different, either.<br />\n2) Keep Eddie Murray. Yeah,<br />\nI know he's become overweight,<br />\nand I must reluctantly agree that<br />\nhe has an attitude problem, but<br />\nthe man can certainly play the<br />\ngame of baseball. Would you<br />\ntrade a man who hit .277 with 30<br />\nhomers and 91 rbi's? Sure, the<br />\nOrioles have some fine minorleague talent, but I certainly<br />\nwouldn't trade away a certain<br />\nHall-of-Famer in order to play<br />\nJim Traber.<br />\n3) Settle on Billy Ripken at second base. I'm far from convinced that Billy is the best secondbaseman the Orioles currently<br />\nhave, but I'm not convinced he's<br />\nnot, either. He has no power, but<br />\nhe did have a .365 OBP, and he<br />\ncommitted only 3 errors in 58<br />\ngames.<br />\n4) Get Fred Lynn out of center<br />\nfield. A move that is already<br />\nrumored to be in the works, and<br />\nhigh time, too. Anyone who saw<br />\nLynn play center this year could<br />\ntell that he's just not up to it<br />\nanymore. Besides, moving Lynn<br />\ncould give the O's a chance to. . .<br />\n5) Play Ken Gerhart in center<br />\nevery day. He finished the season<br />\non the disabled list, but his stats<br />\nprojected over the full season<br />\n<br />\nwould give him 25 homers for the<br />\nyear. He's gonna be a good one.<br />\n6)Groom Pete Stanicek to play<br />\nthird base. Though a natural second baseman, Stanicek (unlike<br />\nBilly) can also play third base.<br />\nConsidering the O's have a void<br />\nat third base (you're welcome,<br />\nRay), the move would give the<br />\nteam one of the best defensive infields in the league. Oh,<br />\n<br />\nyes. . . Stanicek would also outhit and out-run the Colossus of<br />\nRhodes himself, Mr. Knight.<br />\n7)Bid adieu to Scott McGregor.<br />\nThis one hurts me a lot, as Scotty has always been one of my<br />\nfavorites. But the numbers (2-7,<br />\n6.64 ERA, 147 baserunners in<br />\nonly 85 innings) leave absolutely<br />\nno doubt.<br />\n8)Fire Cal Ripken, Sr. I was<br />\n<br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br />\nBIOTECH SALES<br />\nInnovative molecular biology products Enormous<br />\npotential lor aggressive.,highly motivated self starter<br />\nLab experience preferred sales experience a plus<br />\nPlease send resume to<br />\nNational Sates Manager<br />\nNATIONAL DIAGNOSTICS<br />\n1013.1017 Kennedy Blvd<br />\nManville NJ 08835<br />\n<br />\nQUIKTYPE\u2014Professional typing<br />\nand word processing. 7 days/<br />\nweek. 542-2755.<br />\n$10-$660 weekly/up mailing circulars!

He<br />\nthen focused on the children of Lebanon and<br />\ntheir great role in truly liberating the country.<br />\nBrought up in a brutal generation, made into refugees and orphans, children suffer in a<br />\n\"world of bitterness\" never created by<br />\nthemselves. Ward described their childhood<br />\nas \"raw, overwhelming fear.\"<br />\nAll have suffered, he said. \"No words do<br />\ndefine the fear, anguish, and uncertainty of<br />\nthe future\" for them. Ward described many<br />\nas giving up, or being forced into malicious<br />\nservice. Others have become fanatics, simply because their inexperience and idealism \u2022<br />\nhave confused them.<br />\nStill, many young people love the country<br />\nand are weary of sectarianism, said Ward.<br />\n\"They want a Lebanese identity,\" he continued. What matters to them is who they are<br />\nas individuals. \"They want Lebanese to be<br />\nfirst, all else second,\" he said. \"The voices<br />\nare there, the dreams, hopes, and beliefs in<br />\na future are there.\"<br /><br />\nIn supporting his point that the youth hold<br />\nthe future of the country, Ward talked about<br />\nhis experiences with Lebanese baseball and<br />\nLebanon's Red Cross kids. He described<br />\nAmerican amateur baseball as \"win or else\"<br />\nand playing \"with a vengeance.\" He was not<br />\nvery successful his first time in trying to play.<br />\nIn the spring of 1986, he joined an amateur<br />\nLebanese baseball team, composed of beginners. Every Sunday morning, he would play.<br />\n\"There was something wonderful about the<br />\ngame\u2014emotional,\" he said. He said that the<br />\nkids did not count errors, but were out only<br />\nto have plain fun.<br />\n\"The youth of Lebanon has given me some<br />\nof the loveliest moments of my life,\" he said.<br />\nThey are a microcosm of the way Lebanon<br />\nused to be\u2014tolerant, forgiving, fun\u2014where<br />\nyoung men of all religions could get together<br />\nas \"friends and equals.\"<br />\nAccording to Ward, Lebanon's present condition can be overcome. \"The recognition of<br />\nfalsehoods on the field will be spread<br />\nthroughout the land,\" he said.<br />\nThe Red Cross kids are volunteers that<br />\nmarch to the latest disaster in Lebanon,<br />\ntwenty-four hours a day, explained Ward.<br />\nThey drive ambulances, gather the wounded,<br />\nand save lives. They also get killed. \"They're<br />\ncaught up in a mad world they aren't responsible for,\" he said. He also cited future uncertainty caused by a collapsed economy.<br />\n\"Why?\" asked Ward. \"Why do the Red<br />\nCross kids go out of their way for more<br />\ndanger? Why do they work with the elders,<br />\nrisk their lives, and outpour their love,<br />\ntenderness, and gentleness?<br />\n\"Because,\" Ward answered, \"they<br />\nbelieve, have hope, see a distant day when<br /><br />\npeace will come, when their country will be<br />\nwhole again. In every field, they will be<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nLebanon will never forget this nightmare,<br />\nsaid Ward. \"Too much has happened to<br />\nforget. But too much has happened not to<br />\nforgive.<br />\nDeeb described Lebanon as \"an experiment<br />\nin a liberal democracy\" from 1943 to 1975.<br />\nIt had free press, freedom of thought, and<br />\nother liberties. But now, he said, it has a<br />\n\"disparity of wealth.\"<br />\nSince 1975, freedoms have been curtailed<br />\ngradually, and setbacks in liberal democracy<br />\nhave occurred. \u2022<br />\nDeeb saw a tremendous effort to end the<br />\nwar, as well as a tremendous nostalgia for the<br />\nold times. Lebanon \"was known for an open<br />\nsociety before,\" he said. Now, it is \"impoverished by war. There's no reason to go<br />\non fighting.\" On the whole, he said, Lebanon<br />\nwill survive and progress. \"The future is promising,\" he concluded.<br />\nNaamani asked for a moment of silence<br />\nbefore proceeding to speak. He then described Ward's picture of Lebanese youth as accurate, and discussed the United States' role<br />\nas a host to knowledge-seeking Lebanese<br />\nyouth. \"They share liberty and democracy in<br />\nthe United States,\" he said. \"They have the<br />\nopportunity to excel in this academic<br />\nenvironment.\"<br />\nHe said that the Lebanese are proud of their<br />\ntradition of liberty and dignity. \"It was our<br />\nway of life,\" he explained. The war only<br />\ncreates \"more problems, more tragedy,\" he<br />\nsaid, and the Lebanese \"will not forfeit their<br />\nrightful place in the region.\" Lebanon's<br />\nfuture, he concluded, looks bright.<br /><br />\nso that three sets of exams would<br />\nbe scheduled on one day, but that<br />\n\"student sentiment has been<br />\nagainst that.\"<br />\nStill, students are distressed at<br />\nthis semester's schedule. \"It's a<br />\nlittle difficult to make the transition from classes to exams if<br />\nthere's no way to recover,\"said<br />\none. Another was more blunt. \"It<br />\nsucks.\"<br />\nSenior Lora Sims, a member of<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies, contended, \"The finals<br />\nschedule is a fiction. Exams are<br />\nbeing bumped up from the finals<br />\nschedule put out by the registrar.<br />\nFurthermore, many papers are<br />\ndue during the last week of<br />\nclasses or during the finals<br />\nperiod, and this creates enormous<br />\ndifficulties for the students.\"<br />\nShe added, \"Some professors<br />\nmay [also] be scheduling exams<br />\nfor their convenience in submitting grades.\"<br />\nAssociate Provost Stephen<br />\nMcClain said that all eight academic divisions of Hopkins operate on semesters of equal length.<br />\nHe noted, however, that the Arts<br />\nand Sciences and Engineering<br />\ndivisions present a special case<br />\nbecause their semester does not<br />\nrun into January. If Labor Day<br />\nfalls late, \"the exam period<br />\nbecomes compressed.<br />\n\"When Christmas Eve falls on<br />\na Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, we must move the teaching<br />\ndays up to December 22 or 23,\"<br />\nsaid McClain, adding that this<br />\npolicy has been in effect in<br />\nprevious years.<br /><br />\nCAMPUS<br />\nCRIME<br />\nREPORT<br />\nAssault<br />\n*Complainant reported at 4:35<br />\np.m. on November 30, she was<br />\napproached while walking<br />\ntowards parking lot \"P\" from<br />\nMaryland Hall by a subject<br />\nriding a bicycle.

He<br />\nsaid that Coca-Cola acted \"to<br />\ndivest in such a way so as to advance the economic stature of<br />\nblack South Africans.\"<br />\nCoca-Cola sold off its interest<br />\nin Amalgamated Beverages Industries Ltd. through a stock offering to employees. The result of<br />\nthe sale, according to Ware, is<br />\nthat sixty percent of ABI<br />\nemployees are now shareholders.<br />\nWare noted that seventy percent<br />\nof the dealers for ABI are black<br />\nand seventy-nine percent of the<br />\nemployees are black, so the \"majority of these shares are being<br />\nconsumed by black South<br />\nAfricans.\"<br />\nAs of September 17th, 1986,<br />\nCoca-Cola had holdings of thirty<br />\npercent of ABI and an eighty percent interest in a canning operation. This figure was down from<br /><br />\nsixty-four percent as of early<br />\n1985. The thirty-four percent, according to the New York Times,<br />\nwas purchased by South African<br />\nBreweries and in so doing gained controlling interest of ABI<br />\nwith fifty-five percent of the<br />\nstock. The remaining fifteen percent was owned by CadburySchweppes P.L.C. of Britain at<br />\nthe time of the 1986<br />\nannouncement.<br />\nNapata, in his opening<br />\nremarks, challenged both CocaCola's philosophical approach to<br />\ndealing with South Africa and<br />\nWare's assertions that blacks had<br />\nbeen made better off, even<br />\neconomically, by the company's<br />\ndisinvestment.<br />\nRebuking Ware's claim that<br />\nCoca-Cola had responded to the<br />\nwill of black South Africans,<br />\nNapata said blacks had very different desires. \"What South<br />\nAfricans want is not a better<br />\npolished capitalism,\" he said.<br />\n\"What [they] want is total independence,<br />\nis<br />\nse 1fdetermination, is the ability not to<br />\njust own a Coke share but a<br />\nSee COKE, 7<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/7<br /><br />\nExperts assert intervention<br />\ncan be morally justifiable<br />\nby Tammy Halevy<br />\nProfessors Hadley Arkes and<br />\nMichael Walzer, each an expert<br />\nin the fields of moral philosophy<br />\nand history, addressed the issue<br />\nof intervention on Tuesday evening in Maryland Hall.<br />\nThe forum, titled \"Ethics in International Intervention\" was<br />\nsponsored by the John M.

Arkes is currently a professor at Amherst<br />\nCollege. His books include First<br />\nThings: An Inquiry Into the First<br />\nPrinciples ofMorals and Justice.<br />\nEach man presented his argument and then answered a variety of questions posed by the audience, which included professors<br />\nfrom the Department of Political<br />\nScience as well as a number of<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\nWalzer explained that although<br />\npresumption is generally in favor<br />\nof non-intervention, three cases<br />\nexist when intervention \"can be<br />\nlegitimately chosen as a moral<br />\noption.\"<br />\nHis first example of justifiable<br />\nintervention was that of a struggle against a colonial regime by<br />\na country claiming statehood. He<br /><br />\nexplained, \"Because the principle of non-intervention is to protect the integrity of the political<br />\ncommunity, [the first country]<br />\nhas no right to rule or oppress<br />\nothers.\"<br />\nWalzer argued that in this instance, military intervention must<br />\nbe a last resort in assisting the nation in its struggle for independence. He illustrated this<br />\npoint with the Algerian struggle<br />\nfor independence from the<br />\nFrench. \"It would have been<br />\njustifiable for Egypt to have sent<br />\nin soldiers to aid the F.L.A.,\" he<br />\nexplained.<br />\nThe second instance in which<br />\nWalzer perceived intervention to<br />\nbe morally acceptable is<br />\n\"counter-intervention\" by a third<br />\ncountry, when one country has<br />\nwrongly intervened in another<br />\ncountry's civil war. The purpose<br />\nof the involvement is to \"deliver<br />\nthe country where the war is being fought to the stronger side in<br />\nthe civil war.\" This example is<br />\nan instance in which \"might<br />\nmakes right\" from the standpoint<br />\nof an external observer. Using the<br />\nSpanish Civil War to illustrate<br />\nthis case, Walzer said that \"intervention [by the United States,<br />\nFrance and Britain] was<br />\njustifiable and perhaps 'morally<br />\nobligatory.'\"<br />\nThe systematic enslavement or<br />\nmassacre of a people by the<br />\ngovernment was the final<br />\njustifiable occassion advanced by<br />\nWalzer for military intervention.<br /><br />\nWalzer further argued that<br />\nhumanitarian ideals need not be<br />\nthe only motivation for<br />\nintervention.<br />\nArkes initially explained that<br />\n\"the principles of moral justice<br />\nare a subset of Kant's Laws of<br />\nFreedom.\" From this theory, he<br />\nreasoned that free elections and<br />\nconstitutional government are<br />\nquite important for a legitimate<br />\nregime.<br />\nArkes argued that the \"condition of autonomy also establishes<br />\nrestrictions on autonomy. . .<br />\n[One] can't create a right to do a<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\nwrong.\" He seemed to advocate<br />\nintervention on a much broader Professors Hadley Arkes and Michael Walzer addressed the issue of intervention in foreign countries in a forum Tuesday evening.<br />\nscope than Walzer.<br /><br />\nNapata insists Coca-Cola still<br />\ngenerates profits in South Africa<br />\nCOKE, from 6<br />\nwholesome share in the destiny of<br />\nSouth Africa.\"<br />\nNapata questioned how blacks<br />\nhad benefitted by the transfer of<br />\npower, outlining the process of<br />\nthis transfer.

The Course Guide was designed to<br />\nprovide information about the upcoming<br />\nsemester's class offerings in an attempt to aid<br />\nthe process of course selection.<br />\nUnfortunately, this semester's Guide is a little<br />\ndisappointing. For example, a number of major courses, like Molecular Cell Biology lecture, Organic Chemistry, Physiological Foundations and Contemporary American Letters<br />\n(CAL)are given no mention. There is not one<br />\nevaluation for any course offered by the German Department, yet there are ten such reviews<br />\nfor the Department of Hispanic and Italian<br />\nStudies' courses.<br />\nIdeally the Course Guide would be a comprehensive manual to which students could turn<br />\neach semester to find course evaluations and/or<br />\ndescriptions about nearly any class offered here.<br />\nInstead, the Guide provides only a random<br />\nsampling of evaluations; students are not likely to take the publication seriously if it is so<br />\ninconsistent.<br />\nThis is not the fault of the Course Guide staff.<br />\nThey've certainly put in many long, hard hours<br />\non this project, but are limited by the quality<br /><br />\nand number of evaluations they receive from<br />\nstudents each semester.<br />\nBoth students and instructors can benefit from<br />\na more solid Course Guide. Professors who<br />\nbelieve they offer high-quality courses should<br />\nencourage their students to fill out Course<br />\nGuide evaluations; they themselves should provide professor's statements about their courses.<br />\nSuch statements could provide information<br />\nabout the scope of the course as well as explain<br />\nthe level for which the course is geared. That<br />\nway, even students who are unfamiliar with the<br />\nprofessor or department can learn whether they<br />\nare qualified to take the course and if the<br />\nmaterial will interest them.<br />\nAn improved Course Guide could make the<br />\ncourse selection process more efficient and effective. We are fortunate to have a group of<br />\nCourse Guide staffers who are willing to put<br />\nthe publicaiton together each semester. But in<br />\norder for the Guide to become a solid, dependable resource, everyone must contribute.<br />\nRather than complain when another mediocre<br />\nCourse Guide appears this spring, fill out your<br />\nevaluations this week and wait for an improved Guide next semester.<br /><br />\nRemembering Dr. Bob<br />\nFriday, November 27 marked the passing of<br />\na wonderful man. Professor Bob Arellano of<br />\nthe Writing Seminars Department exuded a<br />\nwarmth and caring for undergraduates unique<br />\nat Homewood. No single professor helped as<br />\nmany Hopkins students; in addition no single<br />\nprofessor so dramatically was his department.<br />\nServing as advisor to Writing Sems majors<br />\nsince 1975, Bob advised practically every one<br />\nof the 110 or so undergrads in the department.<br />\nHis classes were extremely popular, in large<br />\nmeasure because students felt and appreciated<br />\nhis love of teaching.<br />\nBob's concern for undergrads reached<br />\nbeyond academics. Through his responsibilities<br />\nin Hopkins theater productions and coordinating<br />\nand sponsoring internships he extended his<br />\nwarmth and generosity to any student who approached him.<br />\nActively involved in student theater, Bob<br />\nlamented the inadequacies of the L/V Room and<br />\ntried for years to secure for it a decent sound<br /><br />\nsystem, sound insulation, even spotlights.

Culp levels two accusations against the Oxfam relief<br />\norganization, both of which are<br />\nerroneous.<br />\nThe first issue is whether or not<br />\nOxfam has a political bias which<br />\ninterferes with its relief activities.<br />\nCulp concludes that because the<br /><br />\norganization opposed the U.S. invasion of Grenada, applauds the<br />\nprograms of Nicaragua's Sandinista government, and supports<br />\na nuclear freeze, that it has a<br />\npolitical agenda and cannot be<br />\ntrusted.<br />\nThe fact is, however, that these<br />\npositions and others held by Oxfam are the result of a concern for<br />\nthe realities of economic development, without regard for the<br />\ngeopolitical power struggle which<br />\nguides super-power foreign<br />\npolicy.<br />\nIt is no secret that unemployment doubled to 28 percent in<br />\nGrenada immediately after the<br />\nU.S. invasion, and is now hovering between 35 and 40 percent,<br />\nwhile the foreign debt has risen<br />\nto $50 million under the postinvasion government of Herbert<br />\nBlaize. These are genuine<br />\nobstacles to economic selfsufficiency and stability. As for<br />\nNicuaragua, the United Nations<br />\nhas also lauded the Sandinista's<br />\naccomplishments in areas such as<br />\nliteracy and health-care which are<br />\nrelevant to Oxfam's relief and<br />\ndevelopment mission. Even Oxfam's support for a nuclear freeze<br />\ndoes not demosntrate a bias<br />\ntoward capitalism or communism, simply a realization of<br />\nthe fact that a freeze today would<br />\nsave $400,000,000,000 (trillion)<br />\nby the year 2000 for the U.S.<br />\nalone, money which could, in the<br />\nopinion of Oxfam, be put to much<br />\nbetter use. Indeed, the fact that<br />\nOxfam operates in right-wing<br />\nstates such as El Salvador and in<br />\nleft-wing states like Mozambique<br />\nshows clearly that their true concern is human life and not<br />\npolitical affiliation.<br /><br />\nCulp's second accusation, that<br />\nlittle of the money donated actually contributes to relief efforts, is<br />\neven more clearly false. With administrative costs at less than 8<br />\npercent of the annual budget, and<br />\nover 70 percent of funds going to<br />\ndirect aid, Oxfam is the envy of<br />\nnon-profit relief organizations.<br />\nChris Culp's \"propagandistic<br />\nillusion\" is his own. Oxfam is<br />\namong the most widely respected<br />\nof international organizations,<br />\nand deserves our support and<br />\nadmiration.<br />\nJay Kaufman<br /><br />\nIncompetent Writing<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThroughout this past fall, the<br />\nNews-Letter's sportswriting has<br />\nbeen simply atrocious. I am referring, specifically, to the<br />\n\"writing\" of Jonathan Missner in<br />\nhis football articles.<br />\nMy guess is that this man never<br />\nattended a single football game.<br />\nHe had an entire week to write an<br />\narticle, and consistantly came up<br />\nwith a cheap synopsis of the Sunday Baltimore Sun article (which<br />\nwas never very good to begin<br />\nwith).<br />\nAll Jon had to do is ask the<br />\nAthletic Center for statistics and<br />\ntake an hour to interview a couple of players. With the ongoing<br />\nattempts to get this campus involved in Hopkins athletics, the<br />\nNews-Letter should feel ashamed<br />\nfor allowing a \"sportswriter\" to<br />\nembarass them as Missner did in<br />\nhis articles.<br />\nA prime example of Jon's ineptitude was his \"grande finale\"<br />\nabout the Western Maryland<br />\ngame. In this final article he<br /><br />\nshould have, at the very least,<br />\ntalked to some of the seniors who<br />\nhad just played the last football<br />\ngame of their lives. Instead, he<br />\nchose to paraphrase the Baltimore<br />\nSun's article. The rifle team<br />\nreceived more coverage this<br />\nweek!<br />\nI realize the team was only 4-6,<br />\nbut they were much better than<br />\ntheir record indicated. The team<br />\ndeserved more than the lame<br />\nNews-Letter gave them.<br />\nWhen a person takes on a<br />\nresponsbility such as writing for<br />\nthe major fall sport, he has to put<br />\nmore than twenty minutes a week<br />\ninto writing the article. Hopkins<br />\nfootball should have been receiving headlines all season, but instead closed out the year on the<br />\nbottom of the page (under the rifle article!?).<br />\nI feel Missner owes the football<br />\nteam, especially the seniors, an<br />\napology for his lack of writing<br />\nability. The saddest part is that it<br />\nis too late for these seniors who<br />\nhave lost out to Jon's<br />\nincompetence.<br />\nTom Loftus<br />\nJohn Pattaras<br /><br />\nShowing Support<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the years from 1933 to 1939,<br />\nover 3 million people requested<br />\npermission to leave their<br />\nhomeland.

Well, for the past<br />\nthirty years, the Hopkins Tutoring Service has been supplying<br />\nthe Baltimore City area with enthusiastic ones. The tutors are all<br />\nvolunteers and the program is<br />\ncoordinated by Senior Paul Swanson and Junior Lynn Thomas on<br />\nMondays and Wednesdays, and<br />\nby Liz VanAmerongen, who is<br />\nthe full time director of the tutoring project, on Tuesdays and<br />\nThursdays.<br />\n\"One of the biggest bonuses of<br />\nthe program is that it's one on<br />\none,\" said Swanson, who is also<br />\nthe housemaster of Baker. He<br />\nbelieves that this changes the<br />\nchild's attitude toward learning,<br />\nmaking it \"more positive. \u2014 This,<br />\nhe adds, \"will have long term effects.\"<br />\nSwanson said that the best thing<br />\nabout the program is that it's free<br />\nfor the children. \"It's rare to have<br />\nthat. It makes the program very<br />\nspecial.\" He described the Tutoring Service as being \"fortunate\"<br />\nthat the University and the Urban<br />\nServices agency, a federally<br />\nsponsored service, support it.<br />\nThe University offers financially strong support to the tutoring<br />\nservice, and hires people to buy<br />\ngames and supplies. The Tutoring Service also sets up many<br />\nspecial events through the<br /><br />\nUniversity. For example, there<br />\nwas a Halloween party this year<br />\nfor the children that was sponsored by the Office of Residential Life. There was also a field<br />\ntrip, where tutors and their tutees<br />\nwent roller-skating together.<br />\nEvery semester there is a<br />\ngraduation ceremony for the kids.<br />\nKurt Schmoke, current mayorelect, as well as Parren Mitchell,<br />\na former senator from Baltimore,<br />\nspoke at a graduation a couple<br />\nyears ago.

A bus picks up<br />\nthe kids, who all live in basically<br />\nthe same neighborbhood. Then<br />\nthey go with their tutors to study<br />\nin any available classrooms, the<br />\nglass pavilion, or anywhere else<br />\non campus. \"The kids are pretty<br />\nyoung, between the ages of six<br />\nand twelve,\" said Swanson.<br />\nTherefore, the tutoring involves<br />\nmostly remedial math and<br />\nreading.<br />\nOne day a semester there is a<br />\n\"reverse-session.\" Tutors get on<br />\na van and go to their tutees'<br />\nhouses for the regualr session. It<br />\nopens up the tutors eyes to where<br />\ntheir students live and the situation at home. \"It's good to get the<br />\nflavor for it,\" said Swanson, but<br />\non the whole, the reverse-session<br />\n\"isn't very productive.\" Kids are<br /><br />\nbusy showing off their houses and<br />\nintroducing their family, he said.<br />\nParents usually hear about the<br />\nprogram from other parents or<br />\nthe school refers them, although<br />\nright now there's a six month<br />\nwaiting list. On the whole, most<br />\nparents are interested. \"They<br />\ncare enough to sign their kids<br />\nup,\" said Swanson.<br />\nAnd what do the tutors have to<br />\nsay? \"My kid is my friend,\"<br />\nasserted Betsey Wadsworth, a<br />\nfreshman who tutors 13 year old<br />\nBryan Shaffer. \"I'm interested in<br />\nwhat he does later. We get along<br />\nwell,\" she added, \"and he's a<br />\nreally good kid, a sharp kid. He<br />\nwants to go to Duke to play<br />\nbasketball.\"<br />\nJohn McGready, whose first<br />\nregular tutee dropped out of the<br />\nprogram, now teaches as a<br />\nsubstitute tutor. \"I enjoy doing<br />\nit,\" he said. \"It makes me happy. I think I learn more from<br />\nthem than they do from me.\"<br />\nMcGready meets many children<br />\nand has gained \"a whole new<br />\nperspective.\" He added, \"The<br />\nkids are psyched to get attention,<br />\nbut their behavior is usually<br />\ngood.\"<br />\nWadsworth said, \"When<br />\nthey're excited about something,<br />\nthey work really hard on it.\"<br />\nSince she missed the rollerskating field day, she spent all of<br />\nSaturday with her tutee. \"It was<br />\ntotal fun,\" she said.

I speak<br />\nof the recently reinstated Student<br />\nConcert Committee. They have<br />\ntreated you to a sudden but<br />\nwelcome influx of big jazz names<br />\nand underground punk favorites.<br />\nThe outstanding motivational<br />\nand organizational force behind<br />\nthe SCC is Jeff Holmes, a junior.<br />\nLast December, the Student Activities Council decided to bring<br />\nthe SCC back after its five year<br />\nabsence from the JHU musical<br />\nscene. Jeff was appointed to the<br /><br />\nposition of Committee Head.<br />\nAlthough he had neither a budget<br />\nnor a committee to lead, his<br />\ntireless work with promoter Don<br />\nWayner succeeded in bringing<br />\nSuzanne Vega, Pat Metheny, Nils<br />\nLofgren (Bruce Springsteen's<br />\nguitarist), and the Smithereens to<br />\na music-bare Homewood campus. In this semster alone, the<br />\nHoodoo Guru's, 10,000 Maniacs<br />\n(their music is as colorful as their<br />\nname), and Don Dixon and Marti Jones have graced Shriver Hall.<br />\nOn December 10, JHU will host<br />\nthe legendary fusion-jazz guitarist<br />\nAl Dimeola. Tickets are only<br />\n$7.50 at the Levering Box Office,<br />\nif you show your ID.<br />\nAnd if you don't show your<br /><br />\nID'? Then you pay the normal<br />\n$10.50. \"Hopkins students get a<br />\ndiscount,\" says Jeff. \"The 3<br />\ndollars you aren't paying is what<br />\nit would have cost the promoter<br />\nto rent Shriver. But we get it free,<br />\nbecause we are a student<br />\norganization. We should take<br />\nmore advantage of that.\" He<br />\nrefers to the fact that not enough<br />\ncollege students attend these performances, so that most tickets<br />\nare sold to local Baltimoreans. Of<br />\ncourse, there is nothing wrong<br />\nwith locals attending, but as Jeff<br />\nsays, \"It would be much better to<br />\nhave college concerts, with<br />\nstudents from Goucher, Towson<br />\nState, and Loyola converging on<br />\nHomewood.\" The SCC is in<br /><br />\nNuts: Good fodder for TV<br />\nNUTS<br />\nProduced by Barbara Streisand<br />\nDirected by Martin Ritt<br />\nby Sandrine Tiller<br />\nNuts is a forgettable movie.

You can work out the<br />\nplot, the characters, and the ending quite easily.<br />\nBarbara Streisand is Claudia<br />\nDraper, a woman accused of first<br />\ndegree manslaughter. She is also<br />\na high-class hooker, an ill mannered wisecracker, and just about<br />\nto be put away for years into a<br />\npsychiatric hospital. Her parents<br />\nare upper-middle class \"people<br />\nwho care,\" who want her to be<br />\ndeclared incompetent to stand<br />\ntrial, so as to be saved the embarassment. In a back-handed<br />\nway, Claudia and Aaron Levinsky (Richard Dreyfuss) get<br />\ntogether to declare her competen-<br /><br />\ncy in a hearing. Levinsky is a<br />\nman with integrity, ideals, and a<br />\ngood sense of humor.<br />\nOf course Claudia is sane, in<br />\nfact she is saner than anybody<br />\nelse is. In between the courtroom<br />\nscenes, we are shown glimpses of<br />\nClaudia's former life: her<br />\nchildhood, her work as a hooker,<br />\nand the way the crime really happened. These provide good<br />\nbackground while we watch<br />\nClaudia and Levinsky battle an<br />\nunscrupulous lawyer, an incompetent psychiatrist, and the<br />\noverbearing parents.<br />\nAlthough this is based on a true<br />\nstory, the plot is handled in a very<br />\nfacile way. The characters are<br />\none-dimensional, their motives<br />\nare plain and simple. Often the<br />\nmovie drags. The courtroom<br />\nscenes (how many more courtroom movies must we sit<br />\nthrough?) are slow and<br />\nremarkably inconclusive. Streisand's obnoxiousness relieves the<br />\nboredom in parts, but her<br />\nmoralizing is old and thinly<br /><br />\nArts<br /><br />\nFilm<br />\nWeekend Wonderflix presents<br />\ndisguised.

In addition<br />\nto possessing one of the most sensitive and expressive voices in<br />\npop music (not nearly as Ferryesque as his detractors might contend), David Sylvian has also<br />\nbeen one of pop music's striking<br />\nand alluring songwriters, and his<br />\ntalents shine through brilliantly in<br />\nthese spare, primarily acoustic<br />\ncompositions.

He exercises this control<br />\nover the character of Peter (Jordan Karp), a man of \"enviable innocence.\" Jerry approaches Peter<br />\none day in the park in hopes of<br />\ngetting \"to know somebody,<br />\nknow all about him.\" Peter accepts Jerry, embarking in an<br />\nenlightening conversation concerning Jerry's alienation, and eventually becomes the object of<br />\nJerry's obsessive search for<br />\ncompanionship.<br />\nPiccinini is unforgettable as the<br />\ndisturbed Jerry, a character who<br />\nreaches out to the suburbanized<br />\nPeter in a final attempt to<br />\neliminate his loneliness. Jerry<br />\ndominates the weak-willed Peter,<br />\nfirst verbally with his provocative<br />\nquestions, and later by physical-<br /><br />\nly pushing him off the bench<br />\nwhich the two occupy. Piccinini's<br />\nconstant movements and<br />\nmesmerizing stage voice convey<br />\nhis urgent need for fellowship.<br />\nKarp, although his character<br />\nseemed too dazed rather than<br />\nshocked by Jerry at the play's<br />\nopening, reacted wonderfully to<br />\nPiccinini as the show progressed.<br />\nJerry tells the story of his encounters with a dog in his boardinghouse and his attempts to<br />\nbreach the gap of his alienation<br />\nthrough this dog. \"Animals are<br />\nindifferent to me like people. . .<br />\nBut this dog wasn't indifferent.\"<br />\nWhen his efforts fail, Jerry claims<br />\nthat he and the dog \"neither love<br />\nnor hate because [they] don't try<br />\nto reach each other.\" Throughout<br />\nthe play, Peter responds with<br />\neither disinterest or understandable shock, and thus makes the<br />\ndisarming character of Jerry<br />\nbelievable to the audience. Both<br />\nmen, intriguing as well as terrifying, are well cast together and<br />\nmaintain a suitable pace for the<br />\none-act play.<br />\nDespite a distracting and rather<br />\nbloody special effect, the Writing<br />\nSeminars production was entertaining and thought-provoking.<br />\nPiccinini and Karp's performances were convincing and truly memorable. In general, it was<br />\na remarkable and stimulating interpretation of Albee's play,<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nIS ooks<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nRebirth of the graphic novel<br />\nSaga of the Swamp Thing<br />\nby Alan Moore, Stephen<br />\nBissett, and John Totleben<br />\nWarner Books, 148pp, $10.95<br />\nby Mark W. Stewart<br />\nNovels, novellas, poetry collections, biographies. A month or<br />\ntwo ago, the News-Letter ran a<br />\nreview of a different sort of book.<br />\nIt's a relatively new genre in<br />\nAmerica but one that is growing<br />\nat a rapid pace. It's called the<br />\ngraphic novel, a sort of extension<br />\nof the Big Little Book comic strip<br />\ncollections popular in the Forties<br />\nand Fifties. Instead of a series of<br />\nperipherally connected strips or<br />\nstories, the graphic novel concentrates on creating a longer continuity, more closely resembling<br />\nits prose equivalent. \"Comics can<br />\nbe serious\" is quickly becoming<br />\na cliche amongst enthusiasts. The<br />\nsurprising trend that undercuts<br />\nthis belief is that more and more<br />\ncomics are becoming less and less<br />\ncomic-like. It is the serious<br />\nwriters who are advancing the<br />\nfield. Take for example American<br />\nnovelist Jerome Charyn, author<br />\nof Paradise Man and The Man<br />\nWho Grew Younger. He recently<br />\ncollaborated with French artist<br />\nFrancois Boucq, to write The<br />\nMagician's Wife, an awardwinning graphic novel. Alas, the<br />\nmajority of comics found on the<br />\nracks in drug stores are still as insipid and juvenile as they have<br />\never been, perhaps more so.<br />\nSaga of the Swamp Thing, by<br /><br />\nAlan Moore, Stephen Bissette,<br />\nand John Totleben, is one of the<br />\nmore wonderful examples of the<br />\nform's new maturity. Originally<br />\na mid-line horror title, the volume<br />\nis a collection of reprints from the<br />\nfirst six bi-monthly issues<br />\n(#21-27) featuring Moore and his<br />\nteam. Of these six, two stories are<br />\ndeveloped. The first concerns the<br />\nSwamp Thing himself. According<br />\nto the origin laid down by Len<br />\nWein and Berni Wrightson in<br />\n1972, a young scientist, Alec<br />\nHolland, was in the midst of<br />\ndeveloping a \"bio-restorative\"<br />\nformula, designed to encourage<br />\nthe growth of plant life, when a<br />\nbomb went off in the lab and hurled him, body ablaze, into the<br />\nwaters of a nearby swamp.<br />\nInstead of dying, he was<br />\ntransformed by the formula into<br />\na plant-like creature, a ridiculous<br />\nexplanation but one we've come<br />\nto expect from kid's comics. In<br />\nhis first issue as writer (\"The<br />\nAnatomy Lesson\"), Moore surprises us by raising this very<br />\npoint. Then, without changing<br />\nany of the facts (a no-no in the<br />\ncontinuity-minded universe of<br />\nD.C. Comics), he offers a different, almost plausible explanation for Alec Holland's condition,<br />\none that has the ring of true scientific discovery. It would lessen<br />\nthe impact to explain exactly what<br />\nthat discovery is. Suffice to say<br />\nthat it makes for a startling opening. Moore presents the foundations upon which the story is based and then tears them out from<br /><br />\nunder.<br />\nAs masterful as the plot and<br />\nwriting are, a graphic novel is only half complete without the artwork. Stephen Bissette and John<br />\nTotleben were already versed in<br />\nthe ways of horror comics before<br />\njoining the creative team of<br />\nSwamp Thing. Both worked on<br />\nMarvel's Bizarre Adventures as<br />\nwell as a number of underground<br />\ncomics. In Swamp Thing, they<br />\nwork to create a thick gumbo of<br />\nvisuals. Set in the Bayou of Louisiana, the pictures are filled with<br />\nthe overflowing fertility of the<br />\nswampland. Each frame is<br />\ncrammed with detail, the intense<br />\nlinework sometimes threatening<br />\nto overwhelm the picture's subject. To add to this feeling of confusion and uneasiness, Bissette<br />\narranges the panels in overlapping, non-symmetrical patterns,<br />\nusing imperfect square and rectangular frames to distort and<br />\ndisorient the page. But the arrangements are not random. Each<br />\nis designed to amplify the scene<br />\nit is depicting. At their best,<br />\nBissette and Totleben generate a<br />\nsense of motion that drives the<br />\nstory, with all its weight, forward. There are moments when<br />\nMoore's prose begins to verge into poetic territory. Fortunately,<br />\nMoore seems aware of this<br />\ntendency and is careful to match<br />\nthe image closely to the words,<br />\nmaking sure that one supports the<br />\nother. On the whole, he is successful. And there are some who<br />\nwould argue that the poetry is<br /><br />\noften integral to the story's mood<br />\nand certainly to illustrating the<br />\nmain<br />\ncharacter's<br />\ngentle<br />\npersonality.<br />\nThe character of the Swamp<br />\nThing is at once human, natural,<br />\nbelievable, and fantastic. Moore<br />\nunderstands very well how the<br />\nvarious aspects of his character<br />\nconnect and he connects them expertly. The relationship between<br />\nAlec (the name he still goes by)<br />\nand his human friend, Abigail<br />\nCable, is an entirely natural one.<br />\nShe doesn't see him as a monster<br />\nand after a while, neither do we.<br />\nAlec's form is certainly unusual<br />\nenough so that we don't mistake<br />\nhim for human, and yet we can't<br />\nreally say he's anything less. Indeed, as the story progresses, we<br />\ndiscover just how extra-human he<br />\nis.<br />\nThe second half of this volume<br />\nis devoted to what has become<br />\nknown as the \"Monkey King\"<br />\ntrilogy. It is composed of three<br />\nstories: \"The Sleep of Reason,\"<br />\n\"A Time of Running,\" and \"By<br />\nDemons Driven.\" This is where<br />\nthe book begins to live up to its<br />\nhorror classification. The story<br />\nline concerns the summoning of<br />\na special kind of demon\u2014one that<br />\neats, inspires, and kills with fear.<br />\nLike Orwell's Room 101, the<br />\ndemon, named the Monkey King,<br />\nhas the ability to know what<br />\ncauses an individual's greatest<br />\nfear and assume its form. Set<br />\nloose in a school for autistic<br />\nchildren, the creature plays on the<br />\nkids' terror, feeding on them un-<br /><br />\ntil the Swamp Thing and classic<br />\nD.C. anti-hero, Etrigan, the<br />\nDemon, intervene. In what may<br />\nbe the most terrifying two pages<br />\nin comics, Moore and company<br />\ncatalog, in words and pictures,<br />\nthe deepest and darkest fears of<br />\nthese\u2022 autistic children. What<br />\nmakes that so awful is that the<br />\nsource of these fears is not fantasy, but reality; their reality,<br />\ndistorted and enhanced by imagination. In one panel, the<br />\nMonkey King is shown in the<br />\nform of a young girl's molesting<br />\nfather, slurring the words,<br />\n\"Mommy needn't know\" over<br />\nand over.<br />\nAs scary as all this becomes,<br />\nMoore doesn't let it get out of<br />\nhand. He manages to inject just<br />\nenough humor to keep things<br />\nbalanced out. The scenario involving the attic insulation<br />\nsalesman, the stuffed swordfish,<br />\nand Selen's decision not to buy<br />\nthe lawn furniture is hilarious. (If<br />\nthat doesn't spur your interest,<br />\nnothing will.)<br />\nSince leaving Swamp Thing,<br />\nMoore has gone on to do other<br />\nprojects. Most important of these<br />\nis the 384 page epic, Watchmen,<br />\nalso put in paperback by Warner<br />\nBooks. In an interview, Moore<br />\ndescribed it as the comics<br />\nequivalent to Pynchon's Gravity's<br />\nRainbow.<br />\nGraphic novels still have a long<br />\nway to go if they are to fulfill<br />\ntheir potential, but efforts like<br />\nthese are strong, sure steps in the<br />\nright direction.<br /><br />\nSilence's furious melancholy<br />\nby John Galotto<br />\nMadison S. Bell writes to<br />\ndevastate. If you've been feeling<br />\npretty well-integrated with your<br />\nenvironment lately, Bell's new<br />\nnovel, A Year ofSilence, will hit<br />\nyou like a bucket of ice-cold<br />\nwater.<br />\nA Year ofSilence is a powerful<br />\nreminder of the frailty of human<br />\nexistence, expressed ultimately<br />\nby the suicide of its main<br />\ncharacter. The book features a<br />\nparade of desperate people, most<br />\nof whom lack any sense of selfimportance. The scary thing is,<br />\nthese characters are not<br />\nvagabonds; they are young,<br />\ncollege-educated urbanites who<br />\nshould by integrated into society<br />\n\u2014but are in fact on the margin.<br />\nBell focuses on a young woman<br />\nnamed Marian, who is living in<br />\nNew York working as an illustrator for children's books.<br />\nShe is unmarried and unsatisfied<br />\nwith her boyfriend; she is planning for what will be her fourth<br />\nabortion. She is impulsive but<br />\nbored, and she drinks and does a<br />\nlot of drugs. Her personal<br />\ndevelopment is stultifying; she<br />\nhas no love, no enthusiasm, she<br />\nis seemingly without career ambition and without family ties.<br />\nMarian has no connections to the<br />\nworld; she is an existential free-<br /><br />\nfloater.<br />\nBell forces us to think about the<br />\nnature of existence; Marian's<br />\n(and the other characters' as well)<br />\nalienation is not easily written off<br />\nas spoiled-child syndrome (Bret<br />\nEaton Ellis) or pure selfabsorption (Jay McInerney). Bell<br />\ndoes not give enough details<br />\nabout her life to allow that; we<br />\nmust view her plight as proceeding directly frqm the<br />\nloneliness of human existence.<br />\nThe epigraph to A Year of<br />\nSilence is a quote from a Camus<br />\nessay: \"II faut imaginer Sisyphe<br />\nheureux. (Sissyphus must have<br />\nbeen happy.\" By alluding to<br />\nSissyphus at the outset, Bell<br />\nplaces the reader in the fatalist<br />\nframe of mind; as we read about<br />\nthe lives of Marian and her acquaintences, we can only think of<br />\nSissyphus, alone, rolling the rock<br />\nup that hill, just to see it roll back<br />\ndown again.<br />\nThe structure of the book is<br />\nsymmetrical. Focusing around<br />\nMarian's suicide, Bell spends half<br />\nthe book moving towards it and<br />\nhalf the book moving away from<br />\nit. The narrative is developed<br />\nthrough a series of vignettes, each<br />\nof which has a different perspective on Marian's life. To see<br />\nMarian as a supporting player in<br />\nother people's lives is fascinating,<br />\nand Bell pulls it off beautifully.<br /><br />\nHowever, the technique is effective only up to a certain point;<br />\nwhen Bell starts taking the firstperson voice for old ladies and<br />\nbeggars, he compromises a good<br />\npart of his artistic integrity. One<br />\nparticularly nettlesome chapter<br />\nfeatures a phone soliloquy: A<br />\nbored and uninteresting woman<br />\n(Crystal) yaks for ten pages, completely uninterrupted by Sid, who<br />\nis probably asleep on the other<br />\nend.<br />\nAlthough<br />\nCrystal's<br />\nmonologue sheds some light on<br />\nMarian, Bell's gimmicky presentation ridicules her voice, and<br />\nundermines its contribution to the<br />\noverall picture.<br />\nIt is only in a few chapters that<br />\nBell compromises the unity of the<br />\npicture. For the most part, Bell's<br />\nconstruction is coherent and his<br />\nstyling is exquisite. We see<br />\nMarian through the eyes of her<br />\nlover (Weber), her best friend<br />\nGwen, Weber's friends, and<br />\nother miscellaneous bystanders.<br />\nThese different perspectives contribute to an understanding of<br />\nemptiness in the wake of death,<br />\nand they also illustrate the emptiness that presages death. Most<br />\nof the characters, like Marian,<br />\nlead bleak lives. For instance,<br />\nthere is Sinclair, Weber's friend,<br />\nwho is lonely and seeking a relationship. Bell captures the exaltation Sinclair feels at the prospect<br /><br />\nof seeing Gwen, whom he met at<br />\nMarian's funeral:<br />\n\"It was wrong, completely inappropriate, but he felt very happy, couldn't remember when he'd<br />\nfelt so good; it was like coming<br />\nout of hibernation. He raised his<br />\nhand and flexed its fingers in the<br />\nsunlight, wondering at the intricacy of their movement.'Why,<br />\nit's just that we're still alive,' he<br />\nthought, regaining the words of<br />\nthe answer now. 'That's all that's<br />\nwrong with us.'\"<br />\nUnfortunately, Sinclair's joie<br />\n.de vivre wears off quickly. He<br />\nand Gwen are lovers for about a<br />\nyear afterward, until Gwen gets<br />\nbored and blows him off. Gwen<br />\nbids him farewell in a diner over<br />\na cup of coffee, and then bolts out<br />\nthe door; Sinclair sits and stares<br />\nin shock, like Sissyphus watching<br />\nthc rock roll down the hill.<br />\nBell is perhaps at his strongest<br />\nin the first chapter, which<br />\ndescribes Weber's roommate,<br />\nLarkin. Emptiness and silence<br />\nseem to come to a symbolic<br />\ncrescendo with Larkin, a pianist<br />\nwho plays not a piano but a piece<br />\nof wood. As a virgil to his brother<br />\nwho has disappeared and is probably dead. Larkin practices for<br />\nhis upcoming concert on a<br />\nwooden board:<br /><br />\n\"At ease then, Larkin accomplished the lingering twentyfifth, the climax of the minor<br />\nvariations. During the long rest at<br />\nthe end of it he heard what he'd<br />\nbeen half consciously waiting for:<br />\na cascade of notes tumbling out<br />\ninto the air, real sound complete<br />\nwith its declining echo. He let the<br />\npause hang longer. It was an illusion, sure enough, compounded of his fatigue and the tingling<br />\nin his fingertips, the latter of a<br />\ntactile reminiscence of the plucked clusters of a harpsicord. Unshaken, he commenced the first<br />\nof the five final variations, sensing the music in all its particulars<br />\nas it came carved out of its own<br />\ndeepest silence.\"<br />\nThis remarkable passage encapsulates Bell's devastating ambivalence. There is transcendence, but it is illusory, squeezed from the fibers of a wooden<br />\nboard. Larkin pounds the keys<br />\nfuriously, but makes no noise, except for that in his own head.<br />\nBell's message is clear: When<br />\npeople cannot ring out their own<br />\ntranscendent chimes in the face of<br />\ntriviality, cannot adhere to higher<br />\nunities (love, ambition), they exist with the autonomy of a block<br />\nof wood. And they are not very<br />\nhappy.<br /><br />\n18/DECEMBER 4, 1987<br /><br />\n\u2022 If You Stay Put<br />\non<br />\nDecember 6th<br />\nSo Might<br />\nThousands<br />\nof Soviet Jews<br />\nBuses leave MSE Library at 10<br />\na.m., return at 5:30.

It was entitled \"88<br />\nreasons to see the O's,\" or<br />\nsomething like that, but though it<br />\nwas mildly amusing, it reminded<br />\nme that there are still a number<br />\nof things the Orioles need to do<br />\nto get back into contention. My<br />\nlist, which may still be incomplete, goes like this:<br />\n1) Deal away Mike Boddicker.<br />\nI have been convinced for a<br />\nnumber of years now that Boddicker is a master con artist, a<br />\nman who makes people believe<br />\nthat he's more of a pitcher than<br />\nhe really is. Every year people<br />\ntalk about his flashes of brilliance<br />\nand ignore the fact that he has<br />\nzero natural talent. It takes a<br />\nwhile, but after he has a hot start<br />\nin the spring, the rest of the<br />\nleague catches up to him. In 1985<br />\nand 1986 combined, for example,<br />\nhe went 3-13 after August 1. And<br />\n1987 was no different, either.<br />\n2) Keep Eddie Murray. Yeah,<br />\nI know he's become overweight,<br />\nand I must reluctantly agree that<br />\nhe has an attitude problem, but<br />\nthe man can certainly play the<br />\ngame of baseball. Would you<br />\ntrade a man who hit .277 with 30<br />\nhomers and 91 rbi's? Sure, the<br />\nOrioles have some fine minorleague talent, but I certainly<br />\nwouldn't trade away a certain<br />\nHall-of-Famer in order to play<br />\nJim Traber.<br />\n3) Settle on Billy Ripken at second base. I'm far from convinced that Billy is the best secondbaseman the Orioles currently<br />\nhave, but I'm not convinced he's<br />\nnot, either. He has no power, but<br />\nhe did have a .365 OBP, and he<br />\ncommitted only 3 errors in 58<br />\ngames.<br />\n4) Get Fred Lynn out of center<br />\nfield. A move that is already<br />\nrumored to be in the works, and<br />\nhigh time, too. Anyone who saw<br />\nLynn play center this year could<br />\ntell that he's just not up to it<br />\nanymore. Besides, moving Lynn<br />\ncould give the O's a chance to. . .<br />\n5) Play Ken Gerhart in center<br />\nevery day. He finished the season<br />\non the disabled list, but his stats<br />\nprojected over the full season<br /><br />\nwould give him 25 homers for the<br />\nyear. He's gonna be a good one.<br />\n6)Groom Pete Stanicek to play<br />\nthird base. Though a natural second baseman, Stanicek (unlike<br />\nBilly) can also play third base.<br />\nConsidering the O's have a void<br />\nat third base (you're welcome,<br />\nRay), the move would give the<br />\nteam one of the best defensive infields in the league. Oh,<br /><br />\nyes. . . Stanicek would also outhit and out-run the Colossus of<br />\nRhodes himself, Mr. Knight.<br />\n7)Bid adieu to Scott McGregor.<br />\nThis one hurts me a lot, as Scotty has always been one of my<br />\nfavorites. But the numbers (2-7,<br />\n6.64 ERA, 147 baserunners in<br />\nonly 85 innings) leave absolutely<br />\nno doubt.<br />\n8)Fire Cal Ripken, Sr. I was<br /><br />\nCLASSIFIEDS<br />\nBIOTECH SALES<br />\nInnovative molecular biology products Enormous<br />\npotential lor aggressive.,highly motivated self starter<br />\nLab experience preferred sales experience a plus<br />\nPlease send resume to<br />\nNational Sates Manager<br />\nNATIONAL DIAGNOSTICS<br />\n1013.1017 Kennedy Blvd<br />\nManville NJ 08835<br /><br />\nQUIKTYPE\u2014Professional typing<br />\nand word processing. 7 days/<br />\nweek. 542-2755.<br />\n$10-$660 weekly/up mailing circulars!
