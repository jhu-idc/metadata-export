French introduced the Hon. Charles J. Bonaparte, who spoke in opposition to<br />\nthe League.<br />\nMr. Bonaparte based his arguments on Washington's farewell<br />\naddress, and also on some extracts<br />\nfrom the sayings of Andrew Jackson. He defended the Monroe<br />\nDoctrine. Quoting from Roosevelt, \u201ehe compared the United<br />\nStates (if a member of the<br />\nLeague) to a man who loved a<br />\nstranger better than his own family. He read a letter from Mr.<br />\nWilson when in Paris to the<br />\nAmerican public asking for their<br />\nsupport by electing a Democratic<br />\nCongress. The result was a Republican Congress. This he interpreted as releasing the people<br />\nfront any obligation to support<br />\nthe President in his foreign policy.<br />\nDr. French then introduced<br />\nbean Latane, who favors the<br />\nLeague. He did not base his<br />\nfacts as much on past history as<br />\nupon the future. He quoted from<br />\nWashington and Roosevelt.. He<br />\nsaid that the United States has<br />\nbeen in the two world wars which<br />\nhave occurred durincr its existence.<br />\n6 in any that<br />\nand will be involved<br />\noccur in the future. But the<br />\nUnited States has always entered<br />\nwhen the crisis was near. Why<br />\nnot enter at first and have something to say in the matter? He<br />\n-brought out this point clearly. He<br />\nalso told about the Morocco question and the sending of Henry<br />\nWhite to the Algerian conference<br />\nby l'resident Roosevelt which<br />\ncompletely altered the policy of<br />\npolitical isolation which the<br />\nUnited States had pursued. He<br />\nsaid that in the case of every<br />\ntreaty the Senate has either made<br />\nsome alterations or defeated it entirely. He said that we did not<br />\nenjoy economical, financial or<br />\ncommercial isolation from Europe.

During this trip he<br />\ncontracted a cold which later led<br />\nto pneumonia. He was recovering front this attack\u2014in fact, he<br />\nwas so much improved as to send<br />\nChristmas greetings to several of<br />\nhis former colleagues at the Hospital, saying that he was putting<br />\nup a good fight\u2014when he Innj an<br />\nunexpected relapse, and his death<br />\nfollowed directly from a hemorrhage.<br />\nDr. Osler received his degree in<br />\nmedicine at McGill University,<br />\nCanada, and from there he went<br />\nto Europe, where he received degrees from several universities on<br />\nthe Continent. When he returned<br />\nto America he accepted a chair in<br />\nMcGill University. Later he went<br />\nto the University of Pennsylvania,<br />\nand in 1889 Ile came to Hopkins,<br />\nwhere he remained for 16 years.<br />\nIn 1904 Ile went to Oxford to accept the chair of regins professor<br />\nof medicine, the highest honor in<br />\nthe medical world. Since then he<br />\nhas visited Baltimore twice.. In<br />\none of these visits he propounded<br />\nthe much-discussed Oslerian theory, which brought down upon his<br />\nhead a great deal of unjust criticism, as he was misquoted generally.<br />\nhis death is said by many to<br />\nhave been hastened by that of his.<br />\nonly sou, Lieutenant Edward Revere Osier, in whose life both he<br />\nand Lady Osier were immeasurably wrapt. Lieutenant Osier died<br />\nas a result of wounds received in<br />\naction in the summer of 1917.<br />\nFuneral services were held in<br />\nthe Old St. Paul Church, Charles<br />\n<br />\nDr. Ira. Bentsen,-president emeritus of the University, and B. N.<br />\nBaker, professor emeritus of<br />\nChemistry, delivered a lecture on<br />\n\"The History of the Johns Hopkins Chemistry Department\" before the graduate chemistry students.on Friday, December 19.<br />\nDr. Remsen is naturally a modest man, and he was reluctant<br />\nabout making references to himself while talking on the subject<br />\nfor which he is most qualified to<br />\nspeak. In 1870 he received his<br />\nPh. D. degree at the University of<br />\nGiittingen, and then became a*Ssistant in chemistry in the University of Tubingen. From 1872 to<br />\n1876 he was professor of chemistry at Willions College.<br />\n'Ile principal problem at the<br />\ntime when Johns Hopkins bequeathed the greater part of his<br />\nestate for the establishment of a<br />\nuniversity was that of furnishing<br />\nlocal opportunities for those who<br />\nwere seeking higher education.<br />\nWhat America needed was a place<br />\nwhere advanced students could become specialists without the necessity of going abroad, especially to<br />\nGermany.<br />\nEven today, the definition of a<br />\nuniversity is rather vague. Was<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to be of<br />\nthe English, German, or French<br />\ntype? The presidents of the University of Michigan, of Cornell<br />\nUniversity, and of Harvard University agreed that an attempt<br />\nshould be made to meet the demand for higher education. Daniel Coit Gilman, at that time presi(lent of the University of California, was elected the first president<br />\nof the University on December 30,<br />\n1874. He was inaugurated February 22, 1876, and instruction<br />\nbegan October 3, following. Six<br />\nmen were-in the initial faculty, of<br />\nwhom Professors Basil L.

The<br />\nscenes were painted for the occasion by Mr. Carol Sax, with the<br />\nassistance of members of the club,<br />\nand all the appointments essential<br />\nto a finished production were provided with painstaking care.<br />\nThe play was happily chosen.<br />\nWe do not see enough of Barrie;<br />\nand all Baltimoreans who know.<br />\nthat a moving-picture show has<br />\nnothing in the world to do with<br />\nthe drama-should be grateful to<br />\nthe club for an opportunity to see<br />\nanother Barrie play carefully<br />\ndone. In \"The Admirable Crich.ton\" we have, not the tenderly<br />\nwhimsical moralist of \"A Kiss for<br />\nCinderella\" and \"Dear Brutus,\"<br />\nbut a satirical Barrie, who sets before us the problem of master and<br />\nservant \u2014 in England and on a<br />\nSouth Pacific Island. He creates<br />\na very human butler, who in England worships the system of caste<br />\nthat obtains in a well-ordered<br />\nMayfair residence, but who on an<br />\nisland rises naturally to the leadership for which Ile is fitted. The<br />\nreturn to nature works so complete a revolution in two years<br />\nthat when he falls in love with<br />\nhis former mistress he is helped<br />\nto a decision to woo her by two<br />\nhaunting lines from Henley\u2014<br />\nI was a king in Babylon<br />\nAnd you were a Christian slave,<br />\nlines which, by the way, have furnished the impulse for a novel by<br />\nBurton E.

HOWARD STREET<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nNow that the New Year has<br />\ncome and the exams are drawing<br />\nnear, old Hopkins men feel that<br />\nthere is something lacking about<br />\nthe University to make the season<br />\ncomplete. Men who have pondered over this lack of _something<br />\nhave realized that the empty space<br />\nleft in college activity should be<br />\nand soon will be filled in by those<br />\nstudents who pride themselves<br />\nupon their oratorical powers or<br />\ntheir persuasive eloquence.<br />\nThe Debating Council has been<br />\nbusy all fall arranging with other<br />\ncolleges for the annual intercollegiates and the various oratorical<br />\ncontests that Will be held in the<br />\nearly months of 1920. If the traditional triangle contest with Virginia and North Carolina is held,<br />\nand* in all probability it will, the<br />\ntwo Hopkins Varsity teams will<br />\ntravel down to the sunny South<br />\nand meet their old rivals on foreign grounds\u2014at Charlottesville<br />\nand Chapel Hill. This will be a<br />\ndeparture from last year's program, in which our affirmative<br />\nteam stayed home to defend<br />\nHomewood from the aggressions<br />\nof the North Carolinians, while<br />\nour negative team assumed the offensive and carried the war into<br />\nterritory of the Virginians. The<br />\nchange to the present system was<br />\ninstigated by a desire on the part<br />\nof all contestants to insure impartial judging.<br />\nIn the past, Hopkins has been<br />\nmore successful than either of the<br />\nother institutions, with North Carolina a close second. Last year<br />\nVirginia came out victorious with<br />\nHopkins second, while North<br />\nCarolina was forced to yield both<br />\nthe affirmative and the negative<br />\ncontests. This year, Hopkin<br />\nmust assume her old place at the<br />\nhead of the list. This can only<br />\nbe done by making the teams,<br />\nthrough competition and hard<br />\nwork, the best that the University<br />\ncan produce. Places on the team<br />\nare open to all members of the<br />\nUniversity, graduate or undergraduate, and it is the desire of<br />\nthe Debating Council that these<br />\nplaces be hotly contested. The<br />\ntryouts and the subject will be<br />\nannounced within a week or so<br />\nif an agreement can be reached<br />\nwith Virginia and North Carolina.<br />\nIn the meantime, the freshmen are<br />\nbusily at work preparing for the<br />\n24th of January, when they will<br />\nstart the debating ball rolling by<br />\nstaging their annual contest with<br />\nthe sophomores. Those not actually engaged in this contest should<br />\nbear the date in mind and by theil<br />\npresence lend their support to the<br />\ncontestants.

He read a letter from Mr.<br />\nWilson when in Paris to the<br />\nAmerican public asking for their<br />\nsupport by electing a Democratic<br />\nCongress. The result was a Republican Congress.

From 1872 to<br />\n1876 he was professor of chemistry at Willions College.<br />\n'Ile principal problem at the<br />\ntime when Johns Hopkins bequeathed the greater part of his<br />\nestate for the establishment of a<br />\nuniversity was that of furnishing<br />\nlocal opportunities for those who<br />\nwere seeking higher education.<br />\nWhat America needed was a place<br />\nwhere advanced students could become specialists without the necessity of going abroad, especially to<br />\nGermany.<br />\nEven today, the definition of a<br />\nuniversity is rather vague. Was<br />\nJohns Hopkins University to be of<br />\nthe English, German, or French<br />\ntype? The presidents of the University of Michigan, of Cornell<br />\nUniversity, and of Harvard University agreed that an attempt<br />\nshould be made to meet the demand for higher education. Daniel Coit Gilman, at that time presi(lent of the University of California, was elected the first president<br />\nof the University on December 30,<br />\n1874.

HOWARD STREET<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br /><br />\nNow that the New Year has<br />\ncome and the exams are drawing<br />\nnear, old Hopkins men feel that<br />\nthere is something lacking about<br />\nthe University to make the season<br />\ncomplete. Men who have pondered over this lack of _something<br />\nhave realized that the empty space<br />\nleft in college activity should be<br />\nand soon will be filled in by those<br />\nstudents who pride themselves<br />\nupon their oratorical powers or<br />\ntheir persuasive eloquence.<br />\nThe Debating Council has been<br />\nbusy all fall arranging with other<br />\ncolleges for the annual intercollegiates and the various oratorical<br />\ncontests that Will be held in the<br />\nearly months of 1920. If the traditional triangle contest with Virginia and North Carolina is held,<br />\nand* in all probability it will, the<br />\ntwo Hopkins Varsity teams will<br />\ntravel down to the sunny South<br />\nand meet their old rivals on foreign grounds\u2014at Charlottesville<br />\nand Chapel Hill. This will be a<br />\ndeparture from last year's program, in which our affirmative<br />\nteam stayed home to defend<br />\nHomewood from the aggressions<br />\nof the North Carolinians, while<br />\nour negative team assumed the offensive and carried the war into<br />\nterritory of the Virginians. The<br />\nchange to the present system was<br />\ninstigated by a desire on the part<br />\nof all contestants to insure impartial judging.<br />\nIn the past, Hopkins has been<br />\nmore successful than either of the<br />\nother institutions, with North Carolina a close second. Last year<br />\nVirginia came out victorious with<br />\nHopkins second, while North<br />\nCarolina was forced to yield both<br />\nthe affirmative and the negative<br />\ncontests. This year, Hopkin<br />\nmust assume her old place at the<br />\nhead of the list. This can only<br />\nbe done by making the teams,<br />\nthrough competition and hard<br />\nwork, the best that the University<br />\ncan produce. Places on the team<br />\nare open to all members of the<br />\nUniversity, graduate or undergraduate, and it is the desire of<br />\nthe Debating Council that these<br />\nplaces be hotly contested. The<br />\ntryouts and the subject will be<br />\nannounced within a week or so<br />\nif an agreement can be reached<br />\nwith Virginia and North Carolina.<br />\nIn the meantime, the freshmen are<br />\nbusily at work preparing for the<br />\n24th of January, when they will<br />\nstart the debating ball rolling by<br />\nstaging their annual contest with<br />\nthe sophomores.

At<br />\nfirst the American Journal of Science accepted the articles, but the<br />\narticles were so numerous that the<br />\neditor suggested that Dr. Remsen<br />\nstart a chemical journal of his<br />\nown. In May, 1877, he published<br />\nthe first of twelve numbers of<br />\n\"Notes from the Chemical Laboratory.\" In 1879, Dr. Remsen<br />\nstarted a new journal, The American Chemical Journal. *The journal of the American Chemical Society had by this time become<br />\ngood competitor.
