Every<br />\nyear someone makes plans that die chiefly from lack of financial<br />\nsupport. The complainers then take the field and lament the small'<br />\ncollege tendencies of John Hopkins. They bewail the fact that<br />\nthe football team is weak, that we really have only two sports<br />\non the campus, and, that only one of these has ever done anything actually to increase the fame of the University.<br />\nThere is an old saw that criticism is valueless if it is not<br />\nconstructive. There is an equally old answer that 99% of the<br />\ncriticism one comes into contact with tears down but is completely<br />\nvoid of helpfulness. The reason these self-appointed critics do<br />\nmore harm than good is that they do not investigate actual conditions; they do not try to find the causes for things which appear<br />\nto them as pure deficiency on the part of the athletic officials;<br />\nthey content themselves with superficial observations arid at the<br />\nslightest invitation vent themselves in the wisdom that comes<br />\nfrom knowing little of the actual facts.<br />\nIn spite of this evident dissatisfaction the condition remains<br />\nthe same. Each freshman class discovers it and every year the<br />\nsame old story is dragged from the closet as though it were new.<br />\nIt is a wonder the fact has not saturated the college to such an<br />\nextent that all concerned realize that the only way to improve<br />\nthe situation is to obtain money.<br />\nThe Athletic Association began this year $7,200 behind. The<br />\ndissenters talk of expanding the athletic program and the officials<br />\nwould gladly do it. But the state of the treasury is so poor that<br />\nthe Fifth Regiment.Games had to be done away with chiefly because of the inability to meet expenses.<br />\nIn one more week the Athletic Association will launch the<br />\n1927 Ticket Campaign. That the association needs money has,<br />\nwe think, been sufficiently shown. A rainy season for lacrosse<br />\nwould do considerable damage to sports in general. The sale of<br />\n900 season tickets would enable the management of track and<br />\nlacrosse to put these teams on the proper basis and would insure<br />\nthem against a rainy season.<br />\n- Five dollars provides any alumnus with a ticket to a lacrosse<br />\ngame every Saturday from April 2 to May 21.

Every<br />\nyear someone makes plans that die chiefly from lack of financial<br />\nsupport. The complainers then take the field and lament the small'<br />\ncollege tendencies of John Hopkins. They bewail the fact that<br />\nthe football team is weak, that we really have only two sports<br />\non the campus, and, that only one of these has ever done anything actually to increase the fame of the University.<br />\nThere is an old saw that criticism is valueless if it is not<br />\nconstructive. There is an equally old answer that 99% of the<br />\ncriticism one comes into contact with tears down but is completely<br />\nvoid of helpfulness. The reason these self-appointed critics do<br />\nmore harm than good is that they do not investigate actual conditions; they do not try to find the causes for things which appear<br />\nto them as pure deficiency on the part of the athletic officials;<br />\nthey content themselves with superficial observations arid at the<br />\nslightest invitation vent themselves in the wisdom that comes<br />\nfrom knowing little of the actual facts.<br />\nIn spite of this evident dissatisfaction the condition remains<br />\nthe same. Each freshman class discovers it and every year the<br />\nsame old story is dragged from the closet as though it were new.<br />\nIt is a wonder the fact has not saturated the college to such an<br />\nextent that all concerned realize that the only way to improve<br />\nthe situation is to obtain money.<br />\nThe Athletic Association began this year $7,200 behind. The<br />\ndissenters talk of expanding the athletic program and the officials<br />\nwould gladly do it. But the state of the treasury is so poor that<br />\nthe Fifth Regiment.Games had to be done away with chiefly because of the inability to meet expenses.<br />\nIn one more week the Athletic Association will launch the<br />\n1927 Ticket Campaign. That the association needs money has,<br />\nwe think, been sufficiently shown. A rainy season for lacrosse<br />\nwould do considerable damage to sports in general. The sale of<br />\n900 season tickets would enable the management of track and<br />\nlacrosse to put these teams on the proper basis and would insure<br />\nthem against a rainy season.<br />\n- Five dollars provides any alumnus with a ticket to a lacrosse<br />\ngame every Saturday from April 2 to May 21.

The teams must have more money.<br />\nAthletics belong to the undergraduates. Students make up the<br />\nteams and furnish the bulk of attendance at games.
