This<br />\nwas only one expression of a deeper issue which has continued to pop up<br />\nfrequently over past years. The issue is complex: on one level it concerns<br />\nhow the undergraduate body is represented when it is consulted on<br />\nmatters of Hopkins policy. On another level, the degree of student<br />\nParticipation in policymaking, itself, is a disputed point. Both these<br />\nfactors have arisen a number of times this year, particularly in the debates<br />\nover calendar reform and whether the Academic Council should allow for<br />\nstudent representation in its deliberations.<br />\nThe methods by which this problem has been handled in the past<br />\nhave been unsatisfactory. Students were allowed to attend the faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly and present their case -- but nowhere in the<br />\ndecision-making process did students have any semblance of a vote. And,<br />\nm the question of who is qualified to vote in behalf of students should the<br />\n\u00b0PPortunity arise, present methods are equally unsatisfactory.<br />\nUndergraduates did not know who represented them when the Academic<br />\nCouncil was deliberating on student representation, and Student Council<br />\nmembers involved in that discussion did an inadequate job of reporting<br />\nback to students.<br />\nWe feel that there is a proposal, which is in effect at other schools<br />\n(Rutgers, for one), that could solve this sticky problem. We propose that<br />\nthere be a \"University Senate\" having jurisdiction over policy affecting<br />\nHomewood. A University Senate would be comprised of Administration<br />\nmembers, elected faculty members and elected student representatives.<br />\nWhat matters such a body would have jurisdiction over, and the<br />\nSpecific numbers of administration, faculty, and student members who<br />\nwould sit on the Senate are details which should be decided after<br />\ndeliberation by an all-school committee charged with formulating specific<br />\ngroundrules. However, it is crucial to this concept that each representative<br />\nhave an equal vote.<br />\nWe urge the Student Council, as our present representatives (as<br />\ninsufficient as the current structure may be), to study the Senate proposal<br />\nand call on the faculty and administration to open discussions on this<br />\nproposal. We would hope that the Administration (if it is really serious<br />\nabout including students in policy decisions) and the faculty will seriously<br />\nConsider the University Senate idea as a key to turning Hopkins into a<br />\ntrue, self-governing community.<br />\n<br />\nMore on Levering<br />\nMany Hopkins undergraduates have expressed concern for the<br />\nfuture status of Levering Hall as a result of the troubles aired in last<br />\nWeek's News-Letter. We share this concern for one of the most important<br />\ninstitutions at Homewood.<br />\nThe student referendum over calendar reform proved that.<br />\nundergraduates can, to some extent, influence policy-making at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nE3Y THE A66 OF 35-11-feRE<br />\nWAS So Crint LEFT OF ME<br />\nTHAT 01\\JE PAY I 601 CA(afT<br />\nlk) A DRAFT AOD RoATED<br />\nUP TO THE CEILIK16.<br />\n<br />\nAT Gt),r 2tuRoomf tifE 10SIPE P\\IS itEv ME TO A LEG<br />\nOF<br />\nTV.<br />\n<br />\nSoreygyfV61(<br />\nM'HC-1F<br />\nFIRST TThF (1..)<br />\nFOR<br />\nYEARS..<br />\n<br />\n4;14-1,<br />\n\"Pin sorry, Mr. Travis, bill even here, al Ike Freedom<br />\nUniversity, seven iimes eight is fifiv-six.\"<br />\nSimilarly, we feel that a show of organized student support for Dr.<br />\nWickwire, S.A. President Jim Archibald, and the Levering staff will<br />\nunderline Homewood's concern and help ensure that Levering Hall can<br />\ncontinue its programs next year without unnecessary hindrance from<br />\ncramped budgets or administration bureaucracy.<br />\nWe ask students, therefore, to take the time to send a note, in care<br />\nof the News-Letter, Box 1230, stating that they support the position of<br />\nLevering's staff. This is not to be construed as a \"confrontation\" with<br />\nuniversity administrators -- it is only meant to provide the administration<br />\nwith hard proof of student priorities. All statements should be signed and<br />\ninclude class year and box number.<br />\n<br />\nThe Council Referendum<br />\nThe Student Council has finally discovered that relevance can be<br />\nfun. And, in an effort to consolidate its strengths and eliminate many of<br />\nits traditional areas of weakness, it has drawn up a sweeping series of<br />\nammendments which will be offered to Hopkins undergraduates the week<br />\nafter vacation.<br />\nBecause of our traditional impatience with the Council, we heartily<br />\napplaud any actions which would streamline its procedures and add to its<br />\nfuture effectiveness. Hopefully, the Council's recent victory, coupled with<br />\nnew constitutional reform, will transform that organization into the viable<br />\nforce on campus that it should be.<br />\nIt is clear even now that the ballot to be offered will be long and<br />\nquite complicated. We stress the necessity of giving it thoughtful<br />\nconsideration and not succumbing to the famous \"apathy\" which<br />\nthreatens the validity of every vote taken on this campus.<br />\nThe Student Council, exhibiting a new-found responsibility, has<br />\nworked hard on these revisions.

Perhaps a clarification of certain points<br />\nin this argument is necessary, though I will by<br />\nno means attempt a solution or definition.<br />\nMany radical organizations today connect the need<br />\nfor academic freedom with demands for the cessation of<br />\nsecret research on campus, the removal of ROTC, and<br />\nthe prevention of visits by Dow Chemical and Army<br />\nrecruiters. As these issues in themselves are too large to<br />\ndeal with here, I shall focus on some less known but<br />\nequally important facets of the question of academic<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nIncident: heckling, preventing, and/or stopping of<br />\nspeeches on campus by Robert McNamara, Hubert<br />\nHumphrey, et al.<br />\nComment:\"Congress shall make no law...abridging<br />\nthe freedom of speech.\" In introductory political science<br />\ncourses we, the truly liberal intelligentsia, laugh at<br />\nsurveys which jeveal the hypocrisy of the working man<br />\nwho believes in the constitutional right to freedom of<br />\nspeech but will not allow a communist to speak in<br />\nschools.

The subject's<br />\n'abin<br />\nflame was James Abram Garfield.<br />\nuowever, strictly on the basis of his<br />\n9bituaries, he might have been the other<br />\nlog cabin derived<br />\nPresident.<br />\nImmediately after Garfield's death<br />\n'<br />\nSeptember of 1881, nearly three<br />\nmonths after he was shot, the Reverend<br />\n,<br />\nSwift of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. declared that<br />\n\u00b0d had permitted the President to live<br />\nlur some time<br />\nafter he was shot because,<br />\n<br />\nhad he died immediately, the people<br />\ncould not have borne the shock. The<br />\nReverend Errett of Cincinnati declared<br />\nthat \"three hundred millions of people\"<br />\nwere united in sorrow.<br />\nRussell H. Conwell, biographer<br />\nand Social Darwinist thinker, the<br />\nfounder of Temple University in<br />\nPhiladelphia, wrote that Garfield would<br />\nbe ranked among the great men of his<br />\ntime. In 1884, an article in the Bay<br />\nState Monthly said that the three<br />\nPresidents most respected by the<br />\nAmerican people were Washington,<br />\nLincoln and Garfield.<br />\nHagiographies<br />\nIt appears inevitable that,<br />\nwhenever a prominent man is<br />\nassassinated, his earliest obituaries will<br />\nbe more like hagiographies. Francis<br />\nBacon wrote of death that it \"openeth<br />\nthe gate to good fame, and<br />\nextinguisheth envy.\" One might add<br />\nthat death at the hands of an assassin, of<br />\nwhich there is a great deal in our<br />\nhistory, mollifies even the bitterest<br />\n<br />\nenemies one has had during one's life.<br />\nGarfield, of course, had not<br />\ncontributed very much. A bright<br />\nstudent and a good speaker, he was<br />\nelected to Congress from Ohio shortly<br />\nbefore the Civil War. Due to his political<br />\nposition, he received continual<br />\npromotions during the War, and ended a<br />\ngeneral; however, this pampering of<br />\nenlisted politicians was creating so much<br />\nresentment among career soldiers that<br />\nPresident Lincoln finally directed that<br />\nall members of Congress serving in the<br />\nWar were required for fulltime service in<br />\nGarfield's principal<br />\nCongress.<br />\nlegislation in a generation in the House<br />\nof Representatives was the initial<br />\nestablishment of a Federal Office of<br />\nEducation. He was nominated for<br />\nPresident only after a deadlock of<br />\nthirty-five ballots, and won the election<br />\nby the thinnest popular majority of all<br />\ntime, a shade under 10,000 votes.<br />\nHis principal achievement in<br />\noffice was a battle over the<br />\nCollectorship of the Port of New York,<br />\na high patronage-dispensing position,<br />\n<br />\nwith that state's Senators Roscoe<br />\nConlding and Thomas Platt.<br />\nLoom No Larger<br />\nIt is still true that, when a<br />\nprominent person is assassinated, the<br />\ninitial judgments of his life tend to be<br />\noverwhelmingly favorable.

The<br />\nCouncil will be composed of<br />\nrepresentatives from each department.<br />\nThe Executive Board, with eleven<br />\nmembers, will be composed of<br />\nrepresentatives elected partly by the<br />\nstudents and partly by the Council from<br />\namong their number. The first election<br />\nwill be held some time in May.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Maryland's<br />\nabortion laws concerning the<br />\nmanagement of \"intensely<br />\nundesired pregnancies\" have<br />\nbeen liberalized, there are still<br />\ndiscrepencies and limitations<br />\nwhich hinder the availability of<br />\nabortions.<br />\nThe new law, passed in May of<br />\n1968 and effective last July, states<br />\nthat abortions may be performed by<br />\na physician with the hospital's<br />\napproval if the pregnancy threatens<br />\nthe mother's physical or mental<br />\nhealth, if there is a chance of an<br />\nabnormal fetus, or in the case of rape<br />\nor incest. An overwelming 80-90% of<br />\nabortions performed in Maryland now<br />\nare due to factors involving the<br />\nmother's mental health--usually<br />\npsychic depression.<br />\nReportedly, a therapeutic<br />\nabortion candidate need only make<br />\nsome dire \"hints\" as to what she<br />\nmight do if the pregnancy continues,<br />\nand probably she will be given a<br />\npsychiatrist's approval for the<br />\noperation.<br />\n\"Abortion Mills\"<br />\nAs the law presently stands,<br />\nthere are no residency restrictions<br />\napplied. The two Baltimore hospitals<br />\nwhich perform abortions are fearful<br />\nof becoming \"abortion mills\" for the<br />\nEastern United States. They have had<br />\nto restrict abortions to Maryland<br />\nresidents only.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Irving M.<br />\nCushner, assistant professor of<br />\n<br />\ngynecology and obstetrics at Hopkins<br />\nHospital, this is partially due to the<br />\nfact that the other Baltimore hospitals<br />\nhave reneged on the responsibility for<br />\ncarrying their share of the case load.<br />\nAlthough there are 14 Baltimore<br />\nhospitals equipped to perform<br />\nabortions, only Sinai and JHH<br />\npresently do so to a significant<br />\nextent. The Greater Baltimore Medical<br />\nCenter has, to date, taken only a<br />\nminor caseload.<br />\nAlthough the laws are intended<br />\nto extend the availability of abortions<br />\nto all who are qualified, they have<br />\nfailed to fulfill the needs of the<br />\ninner-city woman. The patient who<br />\ncannot afford medical insurance and<br />\nwho makes more than would qualify<br />\nher as medically indigent, is caught in<br />\nthe middle and unable to afford the<br />\ncost of a therapeutic abortion.<br />\nFor example, at JHH, the flat<br />\nrate charged to the clinic patient is<br />\n$250. This would be covered by a<br />\nhospital Blue Cross family plan,<br />\nhowever, individual Blue Cross plans<br />\ndo not cover the hospital costs.<br />\nAt JHH approximately 90% of<br />\nall therapeutic abortions are<br />\nperformed on private patients at a<br />\nprice of anywhere from $450 - $650.<br />\nAs it stands now, financial<br />\nconsiderations prevent a patient with<br />\na low income from obtaining an<br />\nabortion.<br />\nThere is a way out which<br />\n\"costs\" in lives rather than in money,<br />\nif one is witting to take the risk. Dr.<br />\nCushner has estimated that there are<br />\n\"at least one million illegal abortions<br />\nperformed in the U.S. each year as<br />\ncompared to the 10,000 legal ones<br />\nrecorded.<br />\n<br />\nThe statistics show that five<br />\ndeaths are known to have occurred in<br />\nBaltimore alone last year as a result<br />\nof some complication arising from an<br />\nillegal abortion. There are<br />\napproximately 500 - 1000 such deaths<br />\neach year nationwide.<br />\nIgnorance of facilities available<br />\nand the high cost of a therapeutic<br />\nabortion without financial assistance<br />\nprompts a further increase in the<br />\nnumber of illegal abortions. As,<br />\nquoted from the February 28 issue 01<br />\nof<br />\nthe Evening Sun, the average cost<br />\narea<br />\nghetto<br />\nan illegal abortion in the<br />\nte<br />\nranges from $50 - $75 according tt!e<br />\nSgt. Mary Jane LaPlant, head of<br />\nBaltimore Police Department s<br />\nabortions squad.<br />\nThe illegal abortionist ha!<br />\ncapitalized on the area's hospital<br />\nfacilities in case the patient runs into<br />\nsome complication she cannot handle.<br />\nAccording to a JHH obstetrician, on.,,e<br />\nof these abortionists, \"Rosie,\" viul<br />\ntell her clients that if they begin re)<br />\n\"feel bad or bleed a lot\" after the<br />\nabortion, then they should go to the<br />\nemergency room at Hopkins where<br />\nthey will be helped.<br />\nPoor Rosie<br />\nRosie is rumored to spend hal,f<br />\nof each year in jail, but she doesnt<br />\nmind--the other six months are<br />\nprofitable.<br />\nA possibility for reducing \"the<br />\nsqueeze\" is the _development of<br />\ntaken<br />\nAnti-Zygotic drug that could be<br />\nstores<br />\ndrug<br />\nby mouth and available at<br />\ninduce<br />\nupon request.

Currently, there are<br />\napproximately 1500 births per year to<br />\nmothers 16 - 18 years old in the<br />\nBaltimore area: These teenage<br />\npregnancies account for more high<br />\nschool dropouts than any other medical<br />\nor physical condition.

Washington.<br />\n<br />\nTraditionally, the margin of the Jay defeat in the<br />\nWolfpack game was a reasonable yardstick for measuring<br />\nJay strength in later intercollegiate competition. If, by<br />\nsome stroke of providence, the Pack fell in Much, the<br />\nodds were five-to-one that the locals would be national<br />\nchamps in May.<br />\nJays Must Win<br />\nRecently, however, there has -been a marked<br />\ndecline in the quality of Mt. Washington lacrosse, and<br />\nthe invincibility of the . perennial club champion is no<br />\nlonger assumed. The Pack's drubbing at the hands of<br />\nVirginia and Maryland the last two weeks is already old<br />\nnews. Tomorrow's encounter, then, demands not only a<br />\nplace or show but a win, if the Jays are to carry high<br />\nmorale, psychological advantage, and a reasonable<br />\nchance for success into the collegiate season.<br />\nStatistically, the prognosis from the Yale game is<br />\ngood. Despite sporadic lapses in passing and clearing<br />\n(particularly in the second period) the local eleven<br />\nmustered only four and a half minutes in penalties, a<br />\nspectacular low for so early in the season. In addition,<br />\nthe Jays showed a clear edge in ground balls (81-58),<br />\nfaceoffs (12-9), shots (50-37), shooting pct.(28104<br />\nclears(26-19).<br />\nThe game also quited a lot of speculation about a<br />\npossible weakness in the goal, vacated last year by the<br />\ngraduation of Geoff Berlin. Looking none the worse for<br />\nhis limited varsity experience, John Kelly turned back all<br />\n<br />\nbut two of the fifteen shots on goal during the time he<br />\nplayed. Although lacking the reckless abandon in<br />\nclearing of his predecessor (which may be a good thing),<br />\nKelly cleared with methodical consistency and a great<br />\ndeal less strain on the hearts of the onlookers.<br />\nThere isn't much to say about Attackman, Joe<br />\nCowan. In a rather quiet way against the weak Elis, he<br />\nwas crushing. He took only four shots, scoring three, and<br />\npassed off for three more. Additionally, instead of<br />\nremaining relatively fixed in his position behind the goal,<br />\nCowan showed a vast increase in maneuverability,<br />\n<br />\nJAY STICKMAN, Russ Moore, pursues<br />\n<br />\neffortlessly<br />\nmoving throughout the offensive zone and<br />\ngrabbing eleven ground balls.<br />\nOn the midfield, Charlie Goodell was superb.<br />\npicking up four of five faceoffs, four points, and seven<br />\nplayed<br />\nground balls.

I<br />\nwas impressed with the swimmers but am<br />\nconfident that with the program we are<br />\ndeveloping at Hopkins we can become a power in<br />\nthis meet. The times of the winners are definitely<br />\nwithin our grasp. Not next year nor the year<br />\nafter, but within four or five years, Johns<br />\nHopkins will be fighting for the team title.\"<br />\nIn order to make his prediction stick<br />\nComfort has already set up a weight program fOr<br />\nthe spring and summer. Water polo may also start<br />\nafter spring vacation. Furthermore Comfort will<br />\nspend the summer with Don Gambril at Long<br />\nBeach, Calif. Gambril, assistant women's<br />\nOlympic Coach sent six swimmers to Mexico<br />\nCity.<br />\nIt has been quite a year for Hopkins<br />\nswimming: a 9-2 season, a conference crown and<br />\nnationals. More important, however, is that a<br />\nwinning spirit has been instilled within each<br />\nswimmer and indeed will grow with each passing<br />\nyear, eventually making a coach's prediction a<br />\nreality.<br />\n<br />\nWhat began on October 4, 1968<br />\nfinally ended at Springfield College on<br />\nMarch 22, 1969 when the Johns Hopkins<br />\nswimming team concluded the longest of<br />\nall sports seasons with<br />\nthe NCAA college<br />\ndivision nationals.<br />\nPoint-wise the meet was less than<br />\nspectacular for the Jays, as no one qualified for<br />\neither the consolation or championship finals.<br />\nHowever the trip was invaluable for a number of<br />\nreasons. First was that four school records were<br />\nset. The 400 medley relay (Scott, O'Donnell,<br />\nChernick, Turner) swam a 3:50.2. The freestyle<br />\nrelay (Ware, Weikel, O'Donnell, Turner) ripped<br />\noff an impressive<br />\n3:26.9. Rick Ware established<br />\nnew 400 IM and 100 freestyle standards. Howard<br />\nChernick came the closest to qualifying by<br />\nPlacing 15th in the 100 butterfly.<br />\nAside from the records was the experience<br />\nof<br />\nParticipating in a national meet. Four of the<br />\n,<br />\nse!'en swimmers, sophomores Jim Scott. Mike<br />\n`).Donnell, Marc Solomon, and junior Rick Ware,<br />\nwill return next year. For them,<br />\nthe Springfield<br />\n'neer put things into better perspective. In spite<br />\nof. the<br />\ngreat strides made this year, greater ones<br />\nwill have to be made in the future. That Hopkins<br />\nwas MAC champion meant little or nothing on a<br />\nnational scale. If<br />\nnothing else, however, the trip<br />\nShowed<br />\nthese swimmers the pressure of<br />\nllCompeting 'on<br />\na national level. For them<br />\nnationals was not<br />\na one shot deal. While the aura<br />\n,n d pressure of national competition<br />\nauridoubtedly affected individual performances,<br />\n,ieeprding to Coach Comfort the NCAA college<br />\nnsion<br />\nwill become an integral part of the<br />\nrl()Plcins swimming program. Instead of major<br />\nand during the dual meet season (i.e.-Delaware)<br />\n\"tinid!najor efforts in two league tournaments, the<br />\nax111111m effort will be saved for nationals.

This<br />\nwas only one expression of a deeper issue which has continued to pop up<br />\nfrequently over past years. The issue is complex: on one level it concerns<br />\nhow the undergraduate body is represented when it is consulted on<br />\nmatters of Hopkins policy. On another level, the degree of student<br />\nParticipation in policymaking, itself, is a disputed point. Both these<br />\nfactors have arisen a number of times this year, particularly in the debates<br />\nover calendar reform and whether the Academic Council should allow for<br />\nstudent representation in its deliberations.<br />\nThe methods by which this problem has been handled in the past<br />\nhave been unsatisfactory. Students were allowed to attend the faculty<br />\nGeneral Assembly and present their case -- but nowhere in the<br />\ndecision-making process did students have any semblance of a vote. And,<br />\nm the question of who is qualified to vote in behalf of students should the<br />\n\u00b0PPortunity arise, present methods are equally unsatisfactory.<br />\nUndergraduates did not know who represented them when the Academic<br />\nCouncil was deliberating on student representation, and Student Council<br />\nmembers involved in that discussion did an inadequate job of reporting<br />\nback to students.<br />\nWe feel that there is a proposal, which is in effect at other schools<br />\n(Rutgers, for one), that could solve this sticky problem. We propose that<br />\nthere be a \"University Senate\" having jurisdiction over policy affecting<br />\nHomewood. A University Senate would be comprised of Administration<br />\nmembers, elected faculty members and elected student representatives.<br />\nWhat matters such a body would have jurisdiction over, and the<br />\nSpecific numbers of administration, faculty, and student members who<br />\nwould sit on the Senate are details which should be decided after<br />\ndeliberation by an all-school committee charged with formulating specific<br />\ngroundrules. However, it is crucial to this concept that each representative<br />\nhave an equal vote.<br />\nWe urge the Student Council, as our present representatives (as<br />\ninsufficient as the current structure may be), to study the Senate proposal<br />\nand call on the faculty and administration to open discussions on this<br />\nproposal. We would hope that the Administration (if it is really serious<br />\nabout including students in policy decisions) and the faculty will seriously<br />\nConsider the University Senate idea as a key to turning Hopkins into a<br />\ntrue, self-governing community.<br /><br />\nMore on Levering<br />\nMany Hopkins undergraduates have expressed concern for the<br />\nfuture status of Levering Hall as a result of the troubles aired in last<br />\nWeek's News-Letter. We share this concern for one of the most important<br />\ninstitutions at Homewood.<br />\nThe student referendum over calendar reform proved that.<br />\nundergraduates can, to some extent, influence policy-making at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nE3Y THE A66 OF 35-11-feRE<br />\nWAS So Crint LEFT OF ME<br />\nTHAT 01\\JE PAY I 601 CA(afT<br />\nlk) A DRAFT AOD RoATED<br />\nUP TO THE CEILIK16.<br /><br />\nAT Gt),r 2tuRoomf tifE 10SIPE P\\IS itEv ME TO A LEG<br />\nOF<br />\nTV.<br /><br />\nSoreygyfV61(<br />\nM'HC-1F<br />\nFIRST TThF (1..)<br />\nFOR<br />\nYEARS..<br /><br />\n4;14-1,<br />\n\"Pin sorry, Mr. Travis, bill even here, al Ike Freedom<br />\nUniversity, seven iimes eight is fifiv-six.\"<br />\nSimilarly, we feel that a show of organized student support for Dr.<br />\nWickwire, S.A. President Jim Archibald, and the Levering staff will<br />\nunderline Homewood's concern and help ensure that Levering Hall can<br />\ncontinue its programs next year without unnecessary hindrance from<br />\ncramped budgets or administration bureaucracy.<br />\nWe ask students, therefore, to take the time to send a note, in care<br />\nof the News-Letter, Box 1230, stating that they support the position of<br />\nLevering's staff. This is not to be construed as a \"confrontation\" with<br />\nuniversity administrators -- it is only meant to provide the administration<br />\nwith hard proof of student priorities. All statements should be signed and<br />\ninclude class year and box number.<br /><br />\nThe Council Referendum<br />\nThe Student Council has finally discovered that relevance can be<br />\nfun. And, in an effort to consolidate its strengths and eliminate many of<br />\nits traditional areas of weakness, it has drawn up a sweeping series of<br />\nammendments which will be offered to Hopkins undergraduates the week<br />\nafter vacation.<br />\nBecause of our traditional impatience with the Council, we heartily<br />\napplaud any actions which would streamline its procedures and add to its<br />\nfuture effectiveness. Hopefully, the Council's recent victory, coupled with<br />\nnew constitutional reform, will transform that organization into the viable<br />\nforce on campus that it should be.<br />\nIt is clear even now that the ballot to be offered will be long and<br />\nquite complicated. We stress the necessity of giving it thoughtful<br />\nconsideration and not succumbing to the famous \"apathy\" which<br />\nthreatens the validity of every vote taken on this campus.<br />\nThe Student Council, exhibiting a new-found responsibility, has<br />\nworked hard on these revisions.

Perhaps a clarification of certain points<br />\nin this argument is necessary, though I will by<br />\nno means attempt a solution or definition.<br />\nMany radical organizations today connect the need<br />\nfor academic freedom with demands for the cessation of<br />\nsecret research on campus, the removal of ROTC, and<br />\nthe prevention of visits by Dow Chemical and Army<br />\nrecruiters. As these issues in themselves are too large to<br />\ndeal with here, I shall focus on some less known but<br />\nequally important facets of the question of academic<br />\nfreedom.<br />\nIncident: heckling, preventing, and/or stopping of<br />\nspeeches on campus by Robert McNamara, Hubert<br />\nHumphrey, et al.<br />\nComment:\"Congress shall make no law...abridging<br />\nthe freedom of speech.\" In introductory political science<br />\ncourses we, the truly liberal intelligentsia, laugh at<br />\nsurveys which jeveal the hypocrisy of the working man<br />\nwho believes in the constitutional right to freedom of<br />\nspeech but will not allow a communist to speak in<br />\nschools.

Also, accusing an Establishment, no.<br />\nmatter how rotten or unpopular, of doing<br />\ncounter-insurgency research is analogous to denouncing<br />\na girl for defending herself against a rapist.<br />\nIncident: March 11, 1969.

The subject's<br />\n'abin<br />\nflame was James Abram Garfield.<br />\nuowever, strictly on the basis of his<br />\n9bituaries, he might have been the other<br />\nlog cabin derived<br />\nPresident.<br />\nImmediately after Garfield's death<br />\n'<br />\nSeptember of 1881, nearly three<br />\nmonths after he was shot, the Reverend<br />\n,<br />\nSwift of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. declared that<br />\n\u00b0d had permitted the President to live<br />\nlur some time<br />\nafter he was shot because,<br /><br />\nhad he died immediately, the people<br />\ncould not have borne the shock. The<br />\nReverend Errett of Cincinnati declared<br />\nthat \"three hundred millions of people\"<br />\nwere united in sorrow.<br />\nRussell H. Conwell, biographer<br />\nand Social Darwinist thinker, the<br />\nfounder of Temple University in<br />\nPhiladelphia, wrote that Garfield would<br />\nbe ranked among the great men of his<br />\ntime. In 1884, an article in the Bay<br />\nState Monthly said that the three<br />\nPresidents most respected by the<br />\nAmerican people were Washington,<br />\nLincoln and Garfield.<br />\nHagiographies<br />\nIt appears inevitable that,<br />\nwhenever a prominent man is<br />\nassassinated, his earliest obituaries will<br />\nbe more like hagiographies. Francis<br />\nBacon wrote of death that it \"openeth<br />\nthe gate to good fame, and<br />\nextinguisheth envy.\" One might add<br />\nthat death at the hands of an assassin, of<br />\nwhich there is a great deal in our<br />\nhistory, mollifies even the bitterest<br /><br />\nenemies one has had during one's life.<br />\nGarfield, of course, had not<br />\ncontributed very much. A bright<br />\nstudent and a good speaker, he was<br />\nelected to Congress from Ohio shortly<br />\nbefore the Civil War. Due to his political<br />\nposition, he received continual<br />\npromotions during the War, and ended a<br />\ngeneral; however, this pampering of<br />\nenlisted politicians was creating so much<br />\nresentment among career soldiers that<br />\nPresident Lincoln finally directed that<br />\nall members of Congress serving in the<br />\nWar were required for fulltime service in<br />\nGarfield's principal<br />\nCongress.<br />\nlegislation in a generation in the House<br />\nof Representatives was the initial<br />\nestablishment of a Federal Office of<br />\nEducation. He was nominated for<br />\nPresident only after a deadlock of<br />\nthirty-five ballots, and won the election<br />\nby the thinnest popular majority of all<br />\ntime, a shade under 10,000 votes.<br />\nHis principal achievement in<br />\noffice was a battle over the<br />\nCollectorship of the Port of New York,<br />\na high patronage-dispensing position,<br /><br />\nwith that state's Senators Roscoe<br />\nConlding and Thomas Platt.<br />\nLoom No Larger<br />\nIt is still true that, when a<br />\nprominent person is assassinated, the<br />\ninitial judgments of his life tend to be<br />\noverwhelmingly favorable.

The<br />\nCouncil will be composed of<br />\nrepresentatives from each department.<br />\nThe Executive Board, with eleven<br />\nmembers, will be composed of<br />\nrepresentatives elected partly by the<br />\nstudents and partly by the Council from<br />\namong their number. The first election<br />\nwill be held some time in May.<br /><br />\nAlthough Maryland's<br />\nabortion laws concerning the<br />\nmanagement of \"intensely<br />\nundesired pregnancies\" have<br />\nbeen liberalized, there are still<br />\ndiscrepencies and limitations<br />\nwhich hinder the availability of<br />\nabortions.<br />\nThe new law, passed in May of<br />\n1968 and effective last July, states<br />\nthat abortions may be performed by<br />\na physician with the hospital's<br />\napproval if the pregnancy threatens<br />\nthe mother's physical or mental<br />\nhealth, if there is a chance of an<br />\nabnormal fetus, or in the case of rape<br />\nor incest. An overwelming 80-90% of<br />\nabortions performed in Maryland now<br />\nare due to factors involving the<br />\nmother's mental health--usually<br />\npsychic depression.<br />\nReportedly, a therapeutic<br />\nabortion candidate need only make<br />\nsome dire \"hints\" as to what she<br />\nmight do if the pregnancy continues,<br />\nand probably she will be given a<br />\npsychiatrist's approval for the<br />\noperation.<br />\n\"Abortion Mills\"<br />\nAs the law presently stands,<br />\nthere are no residency restrictions<br />\napplied. The two Baltimore hospitals<br />\nwhich perform abortions are fearful<br />\nof becoming \"abortion mills\" for the<br />\nEastern United States. They have had<br />\nto restrict abortions to Maryland<br />\nresidents only.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Irving M.<br />\nCushner, assistant professor of<br /><br />\ngynecology and obstetrics at Hopkins<br />\nHospital, this is partially due to the<br />\nfact that the other Baltimore hospitals<br />\nhave reneged on the responsibility for<br />\ncarrying their share of the case load.<br />\nAlthough there are 14 Baltimore<br />\nhospitals equipped to perform<br />\nabortions, only Sinai and JHH<br />\npresently do so to a significant<br />\nextent. The Greater Baltimore Medical<br />\nCenter has, to date, taken only a<br />\nminor caseload.<br />\nAlthough the laws are intended<br />\nto extend the availability of abortions<br />\nto all who are qualified, they have<br />\nfailed to fulfill the needs of the<br />\ninner-city woman. The patient who<br />\ncannot afford medical insurance and<br />\nwho makes more than would qualify<br />\nher as medically indigent, is caught in<br />\nthe middle and unable to afford the<br />\ncost of a therapeutic abortion.<br />\nFor example, at JHH, the flat<br />\nrate charged to the clinic patient is<br />\n$250. This would be covered by a<br />\nhospital Blue Cross family plan,<br />\nhowever, individual Blue Cross plans<br />\ndo not cover the hospital costs.<br />\nAt JHH approximately 90% of<br />\nall therapeutic abortions are<br />\nperformed on private patients at a<br />\nprice of anywhere from $450 - $650.<br />\nAs it stands now, financial<br />\nconsiderations prevent a patient with<br />\na low income from obtaining an<br />\nabortion.<br />\nThere is a way out which<br />\n\"costs\" in lives rather than in money,<br />\nif one is witting to take the risk. Dr.<br />\nCushner has estimated that there are<br />\n\"at least one million illegal abortions<br />\nperformed in the U.S. each year as<br />\ncompared to the 10,000 legal ones<br />\nrecorded.<br /><br />\nThe statistics show that five<br />\ndeaths are known to have occurred in<br />\nBaltimore alone last year as a result<br />\nof some complication arising from an<br />\nillegal abortion. There are<br />\napproximately 500 - 1000 such deaths<br />\neach year nationwide.<br />\nIgnorance of facilities available<br />\nand the high cost of a therapeutic<br />\nabortion without financial assistance<br />\nprompts a further increase in the<br />\nnumber of illegal abortions.

Washington.<br /><br />\nTraditionally, the margin of the Jay defeat in the<br />\nWolfpack game was a reasonable yardstick for measuring<br />\nJay strength in later intercollegiate competition. If, by<br />\nsome stroke of providence, the Pack fell in Much, the<br />\nodds were five-to-one that the locals would be national<br />\nchamps in May.<br />\nJays Must Win<br />\nRecently, however, there has -been a marked<br />\ndecline in the quality of Mt. Washington lacrosse, and<br />\nthe invincibility of the . perennial club champion is no<br />\nlonger assumed. The Pack's drubbing at the hands of<br />\nVirginia and Maryland the last two weeks is already old<br />\nnews. Tomorrow's encounter, then, demands not only a<br />\nplace or show but a win, if the Jays are to carry high<br />\nmorale, psychological advantage, and a reasonable<br />\nchance for success into the collegiate season.<br />\nStatistically, the prognosis from the Yale game is<br />\ngood. Despite sporadic lapses in passing and clearing<br />\n(particularly in the second period) the local eleven<br />\nmustered only four and a half minutes in penalties, a<br />\nspectacular low for so early in the season. In addition,<br />\nthe Jays showed a clear edge in ground balls (81-58),<br />\nfaceoffs (12-9), shots (50-37), shooting pct.(28104<br />\nclears(26-19).<br />\nThe game also quited a lot of speculation about a<br />\npossible weakness in the goal, vacated last year by the<br />\ngraduation of Geoff Berlin. Looking none the worse for<br />\nhis limited varsity experience, John Kelly turned back all<br /><br />\nbut two of the fifteen shots on goal during the time he<br />\nplayed. Although lacking the reckless abandon in<br />\nclearing of his predecessor (which may be a good thing),<br />\nKelly cleared with methodical consistency and a great<br />\ndeal less strain on the hearts of the onlookers.<br />\nThere isn't much to say about Attackman, Joe<br />\nCowan. In a rather quiet way against the weak Elis, he<br />\nwas crushing. He took only four shots, scoring three, and<br />\npassed off for three more. Additionally, instead of<br />\nremaining relatively fixed in his position behind the goal,<br />\nCowan showed a vast increase in maneuverability,<br /><br />\nJAY STICKMAN, Russ Moore, pursues<br /><br />\neffortlessly<br />\nmoving throughout the offensive zone and<br />\ngrabbing eleven ground balls.<br />\nOn the midfield, Charlie Goodell was superb.<br />\npicking up four of five faceoffs, four points, and seven<br />\nplayed<br />\nground balls.

They, in turn, are being pushed<br />\nfor positions on the relay by Senior Paul Geshelin and<br />\nSophomore Jay Malizewski. The Mile-Relay team of<br />\nTalbot, Carlson, Geshelin, and Young (fourth in the M-D<br />\nlast year) also returns, although Soph Tim Cook is also a<br />\nstrong possibility here.<br />\nIn the open running events, the tentative line-up<br />\nsees Goldberg, Geshelin, and Malizewski in the 100-yd.<br />\ndash, Young, Talbot, and Goldberg in the 220(where Al<br />\nfinished fifth in the conference), and Carlson, Cook, and<br />\nSenior Ben Gelber in the 440. Among the distance<br />\nrunners, Senior John Gardner and Junior Bill Preston<br />\nwill handle the 880 chores, while the Mile will see Jeff<br />\nLauren (4:26 in the championships) joined by Leon<br />\nMcKeon and John Lazo.

Finally, just so Maurer doesn't get bored on<br />\nin<br />\nSaturday afternoons, he will carry the JHU standard<br />\nthe high jump.<br />\nThe pole vault and the javelin are the two events<br />\nwhere graduation hit the track team hardest, for the loss<br />\nof Bill Pump (holder of the Hopkins record) and Tom<br />\nFaust will have to be made up for with inexperienced<br />\ncompetitors.

Adams House still<br />\nhasn't been shaken out of'its first place berth; it is ahead with<br />\n3941<br />\n/<br />\n2 points. In second place, Gildersleeve has been constantly<br />\nmoving up in the standings and now has 3621<br />\n/<br />\n2 points. Adams' 32<br />\npoint lead could easily evaporate - in the spring. Baker House, last<br />\nyear's freshman house winner, with their 326 points finds itself in a<br />\nsimilar position as that of DU. Baker could play the spoiling role<br />\nagainst Adams or Gildersleeve.<br />\nRoyce House slumped to fourth place with 3181<br />\n/<br />\n2 points. The<br />\nfifth place team is Clark with 262.

Vincent's<br />\nvictories in swimming and badminton, plus a favorable BIA ruling<br />\nwhich changed their basketball record have tightened the race. Wood<br />\nHouse is still in first place with 2461<br />\n/<br />\n2 points, but Vincent is only a<br />\ndozen behind with 2341<br />\n/<br />\n2. The other two upperclass dorms are<br />\nWillard with 148 points and Wilson 57.<br />\nIn the freshman badminton competition, John Fischer and<br />\nBarry Stendig of Gildersleeve won first place by beating Mike Kohler<br />\nand Tod Lee of Adams. Clark and Sylvester finished third and<br />\nfourth, respectively. Vincent's doubles team of Larry Lorefice and<br />\nMark White was unopposed.<br />\nAt the last meeting of the BIA, a motion was made to allow<br />\nfreshman to play lacrosse for their fraternities.

I<br />\nwas impressed with the swimmers but am<br />\nconfident that with the program we are<br />\ndeveloping at Hopkins we can become a power in<br />\nthis meet. The times of the winners are definitely<br />\nwithin our grasp. Not next year nor the year<br />\nafter, but within four or five years, Johns<br />\nHopkins will be fighting for the team title.\"<br />\nIn order to make his prediction stick<br />\nComfort has already set up a weight program fOr<br />\nthe spring and summer. Water polo may also start<br />\nafter spring vacation. Furthermore Comfort will<br />\nspend the summer with Don Gambril at Long<br />\nBeach, Calif. Gambril, assistant women's<br />\nOlympic Coach sent six swimmers to Mexico<br />\nCity.<br />\nIt has been quite a year for Hopkins<br />\nswimming: a 9-2 season, a conference crown and<br />\nnationals. More important, however, is that a<br />\nwinning spirit has been instilled within each<br />\nswimmer and indeed will grow with each passing<br />\nyear, eventually making a coach's prediction a<br />\nreality.<br /><br />\nWhat began on October 4, 1968<br />\nfinally ended at Springfield College on<br />\nMarch 22, 1969 when the Johns Hopkins<br />\nswimming team concluded the longest of<br />\nall sports seasons with<br />\nthe NCAA college<br />\ndivision nationals.<br />\nPoint-wise the meet was less than<br />\nspectacular for the Jays, as no one qualified for<br />\neither the consolation or championship finals.<br />\nHowever the trip was invaluable for a number of<br />\nreasons. First was that four school records were<br />\nset. The 400 medley relay (Scott, O'Donnell,<br />\nChernick, Turner) swam a 3:50.2. The freestyle<br />\nrelay (Ware, Weikel, O'Donnell, Turner) ripped<br />\noff an impressive<br />\n3:26.9. Rick Ware established<br />\nnew 400 IM and 100 freestyle standards. Howard<br />\nChernick came the closest to qualifying by<br />\nPlacing 15th in the 100 butterfly.<br />\nAside from the records was the experience<br />\nof<br />\nParticipating in a national meet. Four of the<br />\n,<br />\nse!'en swimmers, sophomores Jim Scott. Mike<br />\n`).Donnell, Marc Solomon, and junior Rick Ware,<br />\nwill return next year. For them,<br />\nthe Springfield<br />\n'neer put things into better perspective. In spite<br />\nof. the<br />\ngreat strides made this year, greater ones<br />\nwill have to be made in the future. That Hopkins<br />\nwas MAC champion meant little or nothing on a<br />\nnational scale. If<br />\nnothing else, however, the trip<br />\nShowed<br />\nthese swimmers the pressure of<br />\nllCompeting 'on<br />\na national level. For them<br />\nnationals was not<br />\na one shot deal. While the aura<br />\n,n d pressure of national competition<br />\nauridoubtedly affected individual performances,<br />\n,ieeprding to Coach Comfort the NCAA college<br />\nnsion<br />\nwill become an integral part of the<br />\nrl()Plcins swimming program. Instead of major<br />\nand during the dual meet season (i.e.-Delaware)<br />\n\"tinid!najor efforts in two league tournaments, the<br />\nax111111m effort will be saved for nationals. The<br />\nentire swimming<br />\nprogram will be designed to<br />\nProduce the best times at nationals.<br />\nex In addition the swimmers themselves<br />\n_pressed the opinion that next year Hopkins<br />\nw,l11 certainly be<br />\nheard from. Unlikely to be<br />\nPhased by<br />\nthe tremendous pressure, a more<br />\n'axed team will produce better results,<br />\nand all<br /><br />\nB.I.A.
