Since his.<br />\narrival at Hopkins in 1966,<br />\nRothstein, how an associate<br />\nprofessor of Political Science, has<br />\nbeen a favorite of students who<br />\nhave admired his brilliance and<br />\nsubtle wit.<br />\n\"Our foreign policy choices<br />\nbefore 1960 were so much easier<br />\nthan they are now,\" Rothstein<br />\nnoted. \"Old theories, such as<br />\nPolitical realism, have become<br />\nalmost obsolete.\"<br />\nRothstein points to the<br />\nVietnam War as representative of<br />\nthe misconceptions inherent in<br />\nour foreign policy. While some<br />\nplace blame upon the<br />\nbureaucracy or other segments of<br />\ngovernment for our involvement<br />\nin the war, Rothstein feels<br />\notherwise. \"It was an almost<br />\nuniversally shared elite outlook<br />\nabout what our policy should be<br />\nwhich was responsible.\"<br />\n\"What is amazing,\" Rothstein<br />\n<br />\nobserved, \"is that of all the<br />\nadvisors in Johnson's inner<br />\ncouncil, only Walt Rostow<br />\ndoesn't take credit today for<br />\nbeing instrumental in curbing<br />\nAmerican involvement in 1968.\"<br />\nHe views people like Daniel<br />\nEllsberg and Clark Clifford as<br />\nunlikely heros of the anti-war<br />\nmovement, considering their<br />\nroles in its escalation.<br />\nOne lesson of the Vietnam<br />\nWar, Rothstein feels, can be<br />\napplied to our foreign policy in<br />\ngeneral. \"The exit option (as<br />\n<br />\nDr. Robert Rothstein<br />\n<br />\nopposed to continually trying to<br />\nkeep all options open) may be<br />\nthe most effective tool at times,<br />\nand it probably should be used<br />\nmore than it has.\"<br />\nAs an academic, Rothstein has<br />\ndefinite opinions about the role<br />\nof his professional colleagues<br />\nwho, like Henry Kissinger,<br />\nbecome involved in<br />\npolicy-making. \"Of course<br />\neveryone feels that their work<br />\nshould have some kind of<br />\npractical impact. But they<br />\nshouldn't assume they're really<br />\nbringing academic knowledge to<br />\nbear.

Savitz is the first<br />\nfreshman elected to that office in memory and his<br />\nrecord as a loudmouth has already won him a wide<br />\nreputation on campus.<br />\nHe will be far different from the low-profile,<br />\nunimaginative leaders the SC has had in the past. He<br />\nwill not hesitate to criticize the people and the<br />\nconditions he doesn't like and he just might be able to<br />\ndo some good for students here.<br />\nBut Savitz's reputation as a loudmouth will make<br />\nlittle difference to the average Hopkins student unless<br />\nthe newly-elected president can deliver on his promises.<br />\nIn his campaign, he has mentioned all the issues that<br />\nevery one has heard before. Charges that faculty<br />\nmembers don't care about undergradutes, that thereis<br />\nlittle sense of community on campus and that the SC<br />\nneeds new direction are not new. To be effective,<br />\nSavitz must find out what issues are really most<br />\nimportant and concentrate on them. If he does not, the<br />\ntime wasted on epithets and criticism will be lost to<br />\nthe students he is supposed to lead and no one will pay<br />\nany attention to the SC.<br />\nA disorganized group of disinterested people is what<br />\nmakes student government a farce, but some forceful<br />\ndirection might make Hopkins student government a<br />\nworthwhile venture. Strong leadership is what the SC<br />\nneeds if it is to accomplish anything. That is something<br />\nSavitz can provide if he tries.<br />\n<br />\nVice President George Benton's decision to penalize<br />\nstudents for changing their course loads late in the<br />\nsemester brings to the fore whether the University's<br />\ninterests lie in raising the school out of its financial<br />\nbind, or in actually functioning as a place where<br />\nstudents can exercise academic freedom. Changing<br />\ncourses late in the semester is a perogative that students<br />\nshould be provided in a forward looking<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nStudents usually plan out their years at Hopkins<br />\nwith some degree of care, and changes in their<br />\nscheduling is not something that they do so very<br />\nquickly. Of course, some people do abuse the system,<br />\njust as Benton has said, but to penalize most of the<br />\nstudents who use the add-drop system only as a<br />\npossible avenue of escape from academic pressure is<br />\nhard to understand.<br />\nThe money that will be raised from the<br />\nadministrative move just will not be enough to<br />\nrationalize these logical complaints. The Registrar's<br />\nOffice makes so many mistakes now, that it is hard to<br />\nsee that this move will be able to clear up the greater<br />\nportion of the divers errors. Although the funds to be<br />\nraised will certainly help the Arts and Sciences Division<br />\nout of some of its million dollar debt, the small amount<br />\nthat the fee will actually bring in will not offset the<br />\nmove. It just does not seem that the purpose of the<br />\nstudents here should be to make administration easy<br />\nfor the administrators, as Benton suggests it should be,<br />\nbut rather the converse should hold true.<br />\n<br />\nTangled Web<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\nColeman<br />\n<br />\nThe ideas on education of Johns<br />\nHopkins' own James S. Coleman have<br />\nrecently been given a great deal of<br />\nexposure in the popular press.(Baltimore<br />\nSun, Washington Post, Psychology<br />\nToday). Since the content of these<br />\narticles, supposedly addressed to<br />\nproblems in education, coheres precisely<br />\nwith the anti-working class austerity<br />\nprogram now being implemented in<br />\nresponse to the capitalist crisis, serious<br />\ninvestigation is required.<br />\nIn a representative article in the<br />\nSunday Sun (March), entitled, \"Forget<br />\nAbout Learning in School,\" Coleman<br />\nobserves that the wealth of information<br />\navailable to the modern child chiefly by<br />\nway of radio and television, has rendered<br />\nschools essentially irrelevant,<br />\nImmediately we see that to this<br />\nbenighted<br />\n<br />\nrepresentative<br />\n-r\u2022<br />\n<br />\nMake-believe sharp in Shriver Hall<br />\n<br />\nplan challenged<br />\n<br />\narscipmis<br />\n<br />\nmere dissemination of information has<br />\n2.1.P./ ay s been the prime fx..tvc.tion oc<br />\nSWIMJIS. /'us empiricist CILICILJUIL IS MIL<br />\ninconsistent with Coleman's own method<br />\nof \"research,\" as will become clear<br />\nfurther on.<br />\nColeman holds that schools have<br />\ntended increasingly to promote the<br />\n\"narcissistic goal of self improvement\"<br />\ndue to the unnecessary emphasis on<br />\n\"learning...\" That, he says, can be<br />\nrectified by turning the schools into<br />\n\"productive communities,\" or \"work<br />\ncamps,\" where the young will become<br />\n\"socialized,\" learning responsibility by<br />\nretreating to the circumstances of a<br />\nnineteenth century economy in which<br />\nten and twelve year old children<br />\ncommonly engaged in the \"primitive<br />\nstruggle for survival.\"<br />\nColeman is not simply making vague<br />\nmoralistic proposals. He fully recognizes<br />\nthat in order for capitalists to engage in<br />\nthis last ditch effort to squeeze even<br />\nmore out of the working class by<br />\norganizing children into a labor force, it<br />\nwill be necessary to remove \"practices<br />\ncurrently barring young people (from the<br />\nlabor force)...such as minimum wage laws<br />\nand union imposed barriers...\" Such<br />\nstatements in themselves might appear<br />\nfatuous and irresponsible. Their larger<br />\nmeaning lies in their coherence with<br />\ncapitalist cutback policies in this period<br />\nof economic crisis. What Coleman is<br />\nreally proposing here is the destruction of<br />\npresent working-class defenses and the<br />\ncreation of low-cost, in fact, slave labor.<br />\nColeman's proposals toward the<br />\ninstitution of child labor fit only too<br />\nsnugly alongside the adult slave-labor<br />\nprograms already being put into<br />\noperation nationally under the general<br />\nheading of \"workfare,\" and alongside the<br />\nattack on workers being conducted under<br />\nPhase II. Nor is Coleman alone among<br />\nthose domesticated academics who have<br />\nobligingly made themselves useful to a<br />\ncapitalist class desperate to prop-up<br />\nfictitious, paper values by wage gouging<br />\nand forced labor.<br />\nWe are once again being subjected, for<br />\nexample, t o the stench of<br />\np s e udo-scientific arguments that<br />\nintelligence is racially determined, and<br />\ntherefore that a large segment of the<br />\npopulation is incapable of any but the<br />\nmost menial and degrading work,<br />\n(Herrnstein of Harvard, Jensen of<br />\nBerkeley) At the same time certain<br />\neconomists are lending an air of learned<br />\nrespectability to creation of forced labor<br />\nprograms as \"solutions\" to the economic<br />\ncrisis. (Milville Ulmer, and Bennett<br />\nHarrison of the University of Maryland,<br />\namong many others).<br />\nNo economist, however, has yet gone<br />\nso far as to propose work camps for<br />\nchildren. The viciousness of Coleman's<br />\nproposal, disguised as a concern for<br />\neducation, demonstrates a daring we have<br />\nnot seen even among policy makers who<br />\npublicly admit to representing exclusively<br />\n<br />\nthe interests of the capitalist class.<br />\nHow is it possible for Coleman to<br />\nmaintain the illusion that he is a<br />\ncompetent thinker? His previous work is<br />\nsuggestive in this regard. in 1966, under<br />\nthe auspices of the Department of<br />\nHealth, Education and Welfare, Coleman<br />\nprepared an extensive statistical report on<br />\nEquality of Educational Opportunity.<br />\nImmediately following that (Public<br />\nInterest, Summer 1966) Coleman<br />\napologized for the inconclusive character<br />\nof the study. He wittingly pointed out<br />\nthe arbitrariness of his process of<br />\ninvestigation when he suggested that the<br />\nprogram was located in his own<br />\n\"uneasiness\" in moving from description<br />\nto conclusions, as well as HEW's own<br />\nhesitation to make political use of the<br />\ninformation.

The five hour flash<br />\ntour of the area was sandwiched between<br />\ncampaigning in Pennsylvania and a trip to<br />\nWashington to catch up on office<br />\nwork. The crowd of reporters waiting<br />\nfor the hour-late Humphrey milled about<br />\namongst the scanty crowd of onlookers<br />\nand exhibited a generally bored attitude<br />\nconcerning the upcoming news<br />\nconferences. One of three United<br />\nstewardesses deplaning a flight at the next<br />\ngate observed an incoming Delta flight<br />\nand asked \"Is Humphrey on that plane?\"<br />\nAnother turned and asked what seemed to<br />\n<br />\nbe the question of the day, \"Humphrey<br />\nwho?\" \"Hubert Humphrey; the guy who's<br />\nrunning for President\" came the reply.<br />\n\"Oh, that Humphrey,\" the stewardess<br />\nreturned.<br />\nWhen Humphrey finally arrived,<br />\nwinging in on a vintage General Dynamics<br />\nprop-driven Convair with the initials<br />\n\"HHH\" painted on the side, a small group<br />\nof photographers rushed out to meet him.<br />\nDebarking, Humphrey paused for a few<br />\nseconds for the photos to do their work,<br />\nthen heading swiftly over to shake hands<br />\nwith every member of the grounds crew<br />\nhe could find. Halfway up the escalator<br />\ninto the terminal, the \"candidate's smile\"<br />\nsuddenly swept over Humphrey's face. At<br />\nthe top of the escalator the<br />\n<br />\nself-proclaimed \"peoples' candidate\"<br />\nlaunced into the small crowd grabbing at<br />\nevery hand in sight, giving each one a firm<br />\nshake. After apparently exhausting the<br />\nhand supply in the area, he finally walked<br />\nup to.the impromptu podium, surrounded<br />\nby that time with a circle of six Secret<br />\nService men shoulder to shoulder.<br />\nRhinestones<br />\nOn the podium he was joined by the<br />\ntwo co-chairmen of his Maryland primary<br />\ncampaign, Bill Burch and Gladys<br />\nSpellman. The latter was tastefully<br />\ndressed in a white floor-length formal<br />\ngown, adorned several inches above the<br />\nhem with the form of a seated feline cut<br />\nout of a piece of ocelot hide. The form<br />\nwas in turn outlined in rhinestones.<br />\nHumphrey opened the press conference<br />\nwith a short prepared statement, in which<br />\nhe claimed a measure of native status in<br />\nMaryland, having lived in the state for<br />\nsome years while his children were<br />\nschooled here. He went on to extoll<br />\nGladys Spellman's role in his campaign,<br />\nmaking some cloudy reference to<br />\nwomen's lib. In the process of asserting<br />\nthat \"Maryland is a very important state,\"<br />\nHumphrey lauded Governor Marvin<br />\nMandel, casually mentioning that Mandel<br />\njust happened to be the chairman of the<br />\nDemocratic Governor's Conference.<br />\nThe general tone of the statement,<br />\nthough, was that \"I am running a people's<br />\ncampaign,\" declaring Humphrey's<br />\nintentions to bring the issues to the<br />\nworking people.<br />\nIn response to this declaration about<br />\nhis concern with working class America,<br />\none reporter inquired about George<br />\nWallace's campaign, and its working class<br />\ntone. Aware of Wallace's good labor<br />\n'showing in Wisconsin, Humphrey simply<br />\ncalled for \"all good Democrats to join in<br />\nsupport of Hubert Humphrey in the state<br />\nof Maryland.\" His phrasing insinuated<br />\nheavily that any Democrat who did not<br />\nsupport was not, in his words, either<br />\n\"good\" or \"progressive.\" His main<br />\nconcern in the Maryland primary, he<br />\nstated, was the delegate support he stood<br />\nto glean by a good showing here.<br />\nInevitable Question<br />\nWhen the inevitable question of the<br />\nViet Nam war arose, he rattled off a quick<br />\nanswer, apparently memorized by virtue<br />\nof repeated use over the last four years.<br />\nHe said \"I believe we should be getting<br />\nout as rapidly as possible while assuring<br />\nsafety for our troops.\" Somehow that<br />\nsounded familiar. The only thing he had<br />\n<br />\nto say on the war issue which hadn't<br />\nbeen said by every other candidate at<br />\nsome time or other was a<br />\nrecommendation that the war question be<br />\nreferred to the Security Council of the<br />\nU.N. In addition to pacifying critics at<br />\nhome, this would have the added<br />\nadvantage of testing China's new role in<br />\nthe Security Council.<br />\nWhen asked about George McGovern<br />\nand his campaign, Humphrey responded<br />\nin a serious tone,\"Mr. McGovern is a very<br />\nfine man.\"<br />\nHumphrey claimed he was not a<br />\nmachine man, but rather a man of the<br />\npeople, and charged that the Democratic<br />\nmachine in Pennsylvania was trying to<br />\nrailroad his primary efforts in that state.<br />\nBy affiliating McGovern with the ever<br />\nodious political 'machine, Humphrey, the<br />\nmaster of the backhand mudsling, had in<br />\neffect accused McGovern of the alleged<br />\nrailroading efforts. This comment was also<br />\nacted as a kind of foreshadowing that<br />\nseems to indicate that Humphrey may be<br />\nin trouble in Pennsylvania.<br />\nAs one of his aides pressed him to wrap<br />\nthe session up, he made some concluding<br />\nremarks which consisted of trying to<br />\nconvince the listeners that he actually<br />\ncared about Maryland at all. It seemed<br />\nrather obvious though, that his main<br />\npriorities were Ohio and Pennsylvania.<br />\nCandidates Delight<br />\nTurning to leave, he was again<br />\nsurrounded by his cordon of Secret<br />\nService men. Surrounded, that is, until he<br />\nspotted a candidate's delight: a young<br />\nmother with her little girl. Shaking hands<br />\nwith Humphrey, the little girl was told by<br />\nher mother, \"Why, if he gets elected you<br />\nwill have shaken hands with the President<br />\n<br />\nof the United States!\" The kid didn't<br />\nseem very impressed.<br />\nOnce again, the procession got under<br />\nway, the cordon reforming about<br />\nHumphrey. Suddenly, Mr. Humphrey did<br />\na double take to his left, and stopped<br />\ndead in his tracks. What a target! Three<br />\nMarines and a sailor! With the reflexes of<br />\na cat, Humphrey's hand shot out, and a<br />\ngrin hit his face so hard that he began to<br />\nsquint. He bolted through the line of<br />\nsecurity men, and the hand shaking began<br />\nanew with these representatives of the<br />\nmilitary. When it was all over, they<br />\nwalked away laughing.<br />\n<br />\nbar. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nAs the entourage headed back towards the plane, I overheard two elderly women<br />\nstanding off to my right. \"That's him. That's him,\" one declared in a rather<br />\nlacklustertone. \"That's um....er....Hubert Humphrey.\" \"Who?\" inquired the other. \"He's<br />\nrunning for President,\"she was told.

Since his.<br />\narrival at Hopkins in 1966,<br />\nRothstein, how an associate<br />\nprofessor of Political Science, has<br />\nbeen a favorite of students who<br />\nhave admired his brilliance and<br />\nsubtle wit.<br />\n\"Our foreign policy choices<br />\nbefore 1960 were so much easier<br />\nthan they are now,\" Rothstein<br />\nnoted. \"Old theories, such as<br />\nPolitical realism, have become<br />\nalmost obsolete.\"<br />\nRothstein points to the<br />\nVietnam War as representative of<br />\nthe misconceptions inherent in<br />\nour foreign policy. While some<br />\nplace blame upon the<br />\nbureaucracy or other segments of<br />\ngovernment for our involvement<br />\nin the war, Rothstein feels<br />\notherwise. \"It was an almost<br />\nuniversally shared elite outlook<br />\nabout what our policy should be<br />\nwhich was responsible.\"<br />\n\"What is amazing,\" Rothstein<br /><br />\nobserved, \"is that of all the<br />\nadvisors in Johnson's inner<br />\ncouncil, only Walt Rostow<br />\ndoesn't take credit today for<br />\nbeing instrumental in curbing<br />\nAmerican involvement in 1968.\"<br />\nHe views people like Daniel<br />\nEllsberg and Clark Clifford as<br />\nunlikely heros of the anti-war<br />\nmovement, considering their<br />\nroles in its escalation.<br />\nOne lesson of the Vietnam<br />\nWar, Rothstein feels, can be<br />\napplied to our foreign policy in<br />\ngeneral. \"The exit option (as<br /><br />\nDr. Robert Rothstein<br /><br />\nopposed to continually trying to<br />\nkeep all options open) may be<br />\nthe most effective tool at times,<br />\nand it probably should be used<br />\nmore than it has.\"<br />\nAs an academic, Rothstein has<br />\ndefinite opinions about the role<br />\nof his professional colleagues<br />\nwho, like Henry Kissinger,<br />\nbecome involved in<br />\npolicy-making. \"Of course<br />\neveryone feels that their work<br />\nshould have some kind of<br />\npractical impact. But they<br />\nshouldn't assume they're really<br />\nbringing academic knowledge to<br />\nbear. The academic cannot<br />\nreplace the practitioner.\" Rather,<br />\nhe feels, the advisor should<br />\nremain separate, and<br />\nrelatively aloof from daily<br />\npolicy-making decisions and<br />\nrestrict himself to helping the<br />\npolicy-maker understand \"the<br />\nnature df the world.\"<br />\nAlthough an admittedly \"good<br />\nDemocrat\" Rothstein is reluctant<br />\nto praise President Nixon; he<br />\ndoes feel that his overtures to<br />\nChina should bring him credit.<br />\nHe is quick to point out,<br />\nhowever, that aside from China,<br />\n\"There is no foreign policy.

That is something<br />\nSavitz can provide if he tries.<br /><br />\nVice President George Benton's decision to penalize<br />\nstudents for changing their course loads late in the<br />\nsemester brings to the fore whether the University's<br />\ninterests lie in raising the school out of its financial<br />\nbind, or in actually functioning as a place where<br />\nstudents can exercise academic freedom. Changing<br />\ncourses late in the semester is a perogative that students<br />\nshould be provided in a forward looking<br />\nuniversity.<br />\nStudents usually plan out their years at Hopkins<br />\nwith some degree of care, and changes in their<br />\nscheduling is not something that they do so very<br />\nquickly. Of course, some people do abuse the system,<br />\njust as Benton has said, but to penalize most of the<br />\nstudents who use the add-drop system only as a<br />\npossible avenue of escape from academic pressure is<br />\nhard to understand.<br />\nThe money that will be raised from the<br />\nadministrative move just will not be enough to<br />\nrationalize these logical complaints. The Registrar's<br />\nOffice makes so many mistakes now, that it is hard to<br />\nsee that this move will be able to clear up the greater<br />\nportion of the divers errors. Although the funds to be<br />\nraised will certainly help the Arts and Sciences Division<br />\nout of some of its million dollar debt, the small amount<br />\nthat the fee will actually bring in will not offset the<br />\nmove. It just does not seem that the purpose of the<br />\nstudents here should be to make administration easy<br />\nfor the administrators, as Benton suggests it should be,<br />\nbut rather the converse should hold true.<br /><br />\nTangled Web<br /><br />\nOpinion<br />\nColeman<br /><br />\nThe ideas on education of Johns<br />\nHopkins' own James S. Coleman have<br />\nrecently been given a great deal of<br />\nexposure in the popular press.(Baltimore<br />\nSun, Washington Post, Psychology<br />\nToday). Since the content of these<br />\narticles, supposedly addressed to<br />\nproblems in education, coheres precisely<br />\nwith the anti-working class austerity<br />\nprogram now being implemented in<br />\nresponse to the capitalist crisis, serious<br />\ninvestigation is required.<br />\nIn a representative article in the<br />\nSunday Sun (March), entitled, \"Forget<br />\nAbout Learning in School,\" Coleman<br />\nobserves that the wealth of information<br />\navailable to the modern child chiefly by<br />\nway of radio and television, has rendered<br />\nschools essentially irrelevant,<br />\nImmediately we see that to this<br />\nbenighted<br /><br />\nrepresentative<br />\n-r\u2022<br /><br />\nMake-believe sharp in Shriver Hall<br /><br />\nplan challenged<br /><br />\narscipmis<br /><br />\nmere dissemination of information has<br />\n2.1.P./ ay s been the prime fx..tvc.tion oc<br />\nSWIMJIS. /'us empiricist CILICILJUIL IS MIL<br />\ninconsistent with Coleman's own method<br />\nof \"research,\" as will become clear<br />\nfurther on.<br />\nColeman holds that schools have<br />\ntended increasingly to promote the<br />\n\"narcissistic goal of self improvement\"<br />\ndue to the unnecessary emphasis on<br />\n\"learning...\" That, he says, can be<br />\nrectified by turning the schools into<br />\n\"productive communities,\" or \"work<br />\ncamps,\" where the young will become<br />\n\"socialized,\" learning responsibility by<br />\nretreating to the circumstances of a<br />\nnineteenth century economy in which<br />\nten and twelve year old children<br />\ncommonly engaged in the \"primitive<br />\nstruggle for survival.\"<br />\nColeman is not simply making vague<br />\nmoralistic proposals. He fully recognizes<br />\nthat in order for capitalists to engage in<br />\nthis last ditch effort to squeeze even<br />\nmore out of the working class by<br />\norganizing children into a labor force, it<br />\nwill be necessary to remove \"practices<br />\ncurrently barring young people (from the<br />\nlabor force)...such as minimum wage laws<br />\nand union imposed barriers...\" Such<br />\nstatements in themselves might appear<br />\nfatuous and irresponsible. Their larger<br />\nmeaning lies in their coherence with<br />\ncapitalist cutback policies in this period<br />\nof economic crisis. What Coleman is<br />\nreally proposing here is the destruction of<br />\npresent working-class defenses and the<br />\ncreation of low-cost, in fact, slave labor.<br />\nColeman's proposals toward the<br />\ninstitution of child labor fit only too<br />\nsnugly alongside the adult slave-labor<br />\nprograms already being put into<br />\noperation nationally under the general<br />\nheading of \"workfare,\" and alongside the<br />\nattack on workers being conducted under<br />\nPhase II. Nor is Coleman alone among<br />\nthose domesticated academics who have<br />\nobligingly made themselves useful to a<br />\ncapitalist class desperate to prop-up<br />\nfictitious, paper values by wage gouging<br />\nand forced labor.<br />\nWe are once again being subjected, for<br />\nexample, t o the stench of<br />\np s e udo-scientific arguments that<br />\nintelligence is racially determined, and<br />\ntherefore that a large segment of the<br />\npopulation is incapable of any but the<br />\nmost menial and degrading work,<br />\n(Herrnstein of Harvard, Jensen of<br />\nBerkeley) At the same time certain<br />\neconomists are lending an air of learned<br />\nrespectability to creation of forced labor<br />\nprograms as \"solutions\" to the economic<br />\ncrisis. (Milville Ulmer, and Bennett<br />\nHarrison of the University of Maryland,<br />\namong many others).<br />\nNo economist, however, has yet gone<br />\nso far as to propose work camps for<br />\nchildren. The viciousness of Coleman's<br />\nproposal, disguised as a concern for<br />\neducation, demonstrates a daring we have<br />\nnot seen even among policy makers who<br />\npublicly admit to representing exclusively<br /><br />\nthe interests of the capitalist class.<br />\nHow is it possible for Coleman to<br />\nmaintain the illusion that he is a<br />\ncompetent thinker? His previous work is<br />\nsuggestive in this regard. in 1966, under<br />\nthe auspices of the Department of<br />\nHealth, Education and Welfare, Coleman<br />\nprepared an extensive statistical report on<br />\nEquality of Educational Opportunity.<br />\nImmediately following that (Public<br />\nInterest, Summer 1966) Coleman<br />\napologized for the inconclusive character<br />\nof the study. He wittingly pointed out<br />\nthe arbitrariness of his process of<br />\ninvestigation when he suggested that the<br />\nprogram was located in his own<br />\n\"uneasiness\" in moving from description<br />\nto conclusions, as well as HEW's own<br />\nhesitation to make political use of the<br />\ninformation.

The five hour flash<br />\ntour of the area was sandwiched between<br />\ncampaigning in Pennsylvania and a trip to<br />\nWashington to catch up on office<br />\nwork. The crowd of reporters waiting<br />\nfor the hour-late Humphrey milled about<br />\namongst the scanty crowd of onlookers<br />\nand exhibited a generally bored attitude<br />\nconcerning the upcoming news<br />\nconferences. One of three United<br />\nstewardesses deplaning a flight at the next<br />\ngate observed an incoming Delta flight<br />\nand asked \"Is Humphrey on that plane?\"<br />\nAnother turned and asked what seemed to<br /><br />\nbe the question of the day, \"Humphrey<br />\nwho?\" \"Hubert Humphrey; the guy who's<br />\nrunning for President\" came the reply.<br />\n\"Oh, that Humphrey,\" the stewardess<br />\nreturned.<br />\nWhen Humphrey finally arrived,<br />\nwinging in on a vintage General Dynamics<br />\nprop-driven Convair with the initials<br />\n\"HHH\" painted on the side, a small group<br />\nof photographers rushed out to meet him.<br />\nDebarking, Humphrey paused for a few<br />\nseconds for the photos to do their work,<br />\nthen heading swiftly over to shake hands<br />\nwith every member of the grounds crew<br />\nhe could find. Halfway up the escalator<br />\ninto the terminal, the \"candidate's smile\"<br />\nsuddenly swept over Humphrey's face. At<br />\nthe top of the escalator the<br /><br />\nself-proclaimed \"peoples' candidate\"<br />\nlaunced into the small crowd grabbing at<br />\nevery hand in sight, giving each one a firm<br />\nshake. After apparently exhausting the<br />\nhand supply in the area, he finally walked<br />\nup to.the impromptu podium, surrounded<br />\nby that time with a circle of six Secret<br />\nService men shoulder to shoulder.<br />\nRhinestones<br />\nOn the podium he was joined by the<br />\ntwo co-chairmen of his Maryland primary<br />\ncampaign, Bill Burch and Gladys<br />\nSpellman. The latter was tastefully<br />\ndressed in a white floor-length formal<br />\ngown, adorned several inches above the<br />\nhem with the form of a seated feline cut<br />\nout of a piece of ocelot hide. The form<br />\nwas in turn outlined in rhinestones.<br />\nHumphrey opened the press conference<br />\nwith a short prepared statement, in which<br />\nhe claimed a measure of native status in<br />\nMaryland, having lived in the state for<br />\nsome years while his children were<br />\nschooled here. He went on to extoll<br />\nGladys Spellman's role in his campaign,<br />\nmaking some cloudy reference to<br />\nwomen's lib. In the process of asserting<br />\nthat \"Maryland is a very important state,\"<br />\nHumphrey lauded Governor Marvin<br />\nMandel, casually mentioning that Mandel<br />\njust happened to be the chairman of the<br />\nDemocratic Governor's Conference.<br />\nThe general tone of the statement,<br />\nthough, was that \"I am running a people's<br />\ncampaign,\" declaring Humphrey's<br />\nintentions to bring the issues to the<br />\nworking people.<br />\nIn response to this declaration about<br />\nhis concern with working class America,<br />\none reporter inquired about George<br />\nWallace's campaign, and its working class<br />\ntone. Aware of Wallace's good labor<br />\n'showing in Wisconsin, Humphrey simply<br />\ncalled for \"all good Democrats to join in<br />\nsupport of Hubert Humphrey in the state<br />\nof Maryland.\" His phrasing insinuated<br />\nheavily that any Democrat who did not<br />\nsupport was not, in his words, either<br />\n\"good\" or \"progressive.\" His main<br />\nconcern in the Maryland primary, he<br />\nstated, was the delegate support he stood<br />\nto glean by a good showing here.<br />\nInevitable Question<br />\nWhen the inevitable question of the<br />\nViet Nam war arose, he rattled off a quick<br />\nanswer, apparently memorized by virtue<br />\nof repeated use over the last four years.<br />\nHe said \"I believe we should be getting<br />\nout as rapidly as possible while assuring<br />\nsafety for our troops.\" Somehow that<br />\nsounded familiar. The only thing he had<br /><br />\nto say on the war issue which hadn't<br />\nbeen said by every other candidate at<br />\nsome time or other was a<br />\nrecommendation that the war question be<br />\nreferred to the Security Council of the<br />\nU.N. In addition to pacifying critics at<br />\nhome, this would have the added<br />\nadvantage of testing China's new role in<br />\nthe Security Council.<br />\nWhen asked about George McGovern<br />\nand his campaign, Humphrey responded<br />\nin a serious tone,\"Mr. McGovern is a very<br />\nfine man.\"<br />\nHumphrey claimed he was not a<br />\nmachine man, but rather a man of the<br />\npeople, and charged that the Democratic<br />\nmachine in Pennsylvania was trying to<br />\nrailroad his primary efforts in that state.<br />\nBy affiliating McGovern with the ever<br />\nodious political 'machine, Humphrey, the<br />\nmaster of the backhand mudsling, had in<br />\neffect accused McGovern of the alleged<br />\nrailroading efforts. This comment was also<br />\nacted as a kind of foreshadowing that<br />\nseems to indicate that Humphrey may be<br />\nin trouble in Pennsylvania.<br />\nAs one of his aides pressed him to wrap<br />\nthe session up, he made some concluding<br />\nremarks which consisted of trying to<br />\nconvince the listeners that he actually<br />\ncared about Maryland at all. It seemed<br />\nrather obvious though, that his main<br />\npriorities were Ohio and Pennsylvania.<br />\nCandidates Delight<br />\nTurning to leave, he was again<br />\nsurrounded by his cordon of Secret<br />\nService men. Surrounded, that is, until he<br />\nspotted a candidate's delight: a young<br />\nmother with her little girl. Shaking hands<br />\nwith Humphrey, the little girl was told by<br />\nher mother, \"Why, if he gets elected you<br />\nwill have shaken hands with the President<br /><br />\nof the United States!\" The kid didn't<br />\nseem very impressed.<br />\nOnce again, the procession got under<br />\nway, the cordon reforming about<br />\nHumphrey. Suddenly, Mr. Humphrey did<br />\na double take to his left, and stopped<br />\ndead in his tracks. What a target! Three<br />\nMarines and a sailor! With the reflexes of<br />\na cat, Humphrey's hand shot out, and a<br />\ngrin hit his face so hard that he began to<br />\nsquint. He bolted through the line of<br />\nsecurity men, and the hand shaking began<br />\nanew with these representatives of the<br />\nmilitary. When it was all over, they<br />\nwalked away laughing.<br /><br />\nbar. \u2022<br /><br />\nAs the entourage headed back towards the plane, I overheard two elderly women<br />\nstanding off to my right. \"That's him. That's him,\" one declared in a rather<br />\nlacklustertone. \"That's um....er....Hubert Humphrey.\" \"Who?\" inquired the other. \"He's<br />\nrunning for President,\"she was told. After a slight delay came the response, \"oh.\"<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nCLEANERS<br /><br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor Service<br /><br />\nMexican Foods-Cocktails<br /><br />\nWAVERLY LAUNDROMAT<br /><br />\nTIJUANA TACOS<br /><br />\nj<br /><br />\n- BOOKS<br />\nUsed &amp; Rare, Old &amp; Out-of-print<br /><br />\nJohn P.
