He<br />\nprobably left Baltimore like I did last<br />\nFriday, wtih no idea as to how he would<br />\never find a small, low-income , rundown<br />\npseudo-city like Bethlehem. Actually, I<br />\ndid have a few obscure ntoions. My first<br />\nstep was to grab a train at Baltimore's<br />\nPenn Station. The sooner that Baltimore<br />\nwould be to my south, the better.<br />\nPenn Station is neither the newest nor<br />\nlargest of Amtrak's city depots, but it's<br />\ngot that Baltimore charm. From its dusty<br />\nhigh ceiling and walls to its usual<br />\nsmorgasbord of pimps, winos, and other<br />\nfolk to avoid, Penn Station gives one a<br />\nfeeling of relief once it disappears from<br />\nview. AFter purchasing the cheapest<br />\nticket for the 11:42 to Philadelphia, I<br />\ndescended to the boarding areas and<br />\nwaited. When the train arrived, I wasted<br />\nno time getting in -- in, out of that urban<br />\nTartarus hidden by the starion. The<br />\noutskirts of Baltimore yielded only street<br />\nscenes and warehouses to my eyes. The<br />\nview bored me. So I surveyed the rest of<br />\nthe car. Businessmen were gathereing to<br />\nsmoke fat cigars and play poker. Families<br />\npicnicked in their seats, Daddy and<br />\nMommy pointing out all the landmarks<br />\nthrough the window. A man across the<br />\naisle, shout but rotund, snored from his<br />\nseat. His hair was graying; his face,<br />\neroding. There was an absence of<br />\nintelligence in his worn, black suit. I<br />\npinned him for one of those European<br />\nimmigrants that huddle with his kind in<br />\ncity tenements. Other passengers were<br />\nwalking between cars, grabbing a beer or<br />\na sandwich in the cafe car. As the train<br />\njiggled towrad Philadelphia, I cursed<br />\nmyself for not making better use of my<br />\ntime and went to sleep. Evidently<br />\ninspired by the magnificence of rail<br />\ntravel, I dreamt of a lightning quick<br />\nprivate train, which resembled a long,<br />\nPorsche Turbo-Carrera, at 300 miles an<br />\nhour. The exterior was done in gold leaf;<br />\nthe interior, in deep. marron velvet and<br />\nteak. Servants were at my feet. Without<br />\nany apparent evidence, I knew that I had<br />\neverything I wanted. The scenery outside<br />\nthe train windows was done in brightly colored neon and animated flying<br />\ncreatures whisked about.<br />\nThe trip to Philadelphia was like a<br />\nChamber of Commerce propaganda<br />\nmovie, or a rural surveyor's map. Through<br />\nthe window on my right, I saw a<br />\nprocession of plants and factories<br />\nparading past the train._ Chrysler<br />\nCorporation, conglomerating all over the<br />\nplace, displayed acres of new cars and<br />\ntrucks. Thousands of assembly - liners<br />\ncould be seen scurrying about. The<br />\n<br />\nquestion of the factory's environmental<br />\nimpact were unresolved since the well engineered smokestacks disappear about<br />\nhalf way up into a Prestone sky. Various<br />\nchemical companies follow Chrysler in<br />\nthe procession, each in its own shade of<br />\ngray, each with its own smokestack.<br />\nThrough the left window of the train,<br />\nonly an endless array of railroad<br />\nequipment was visible. Spare rails lay<br />\nrusty like scars in the weeds guarding the<br />\nrailroad bed. Empty passenger cars were<br />\npiled everywhere like an urbanrenewal<br />\nproject. Representatives were present<br />\nfrom the B&O, the Reading, the Canadian<br />\nPacific.; the defunct Penn Central, and<br />\nother rail companies I was not familiar_<br />\nwith. Rusted loading cranes rested their<br />\nhuge arms in long - abandoned<br />\nexcavations.<br />\nSoon after leaving Wilmington, the<br />\nrural surveyor's map unfolded before me.<br />\nThere were endless miles of land - just<br />\nland. Nothing was growing; no people in<br />\nsight. If I had been in an airplane, I<br />\nwouldn't have been so distressed;<br />\neverything looks like flat, empty space<br />\nfrom 30,000 feet. But to see such<br />\nemptiness from ground level was<br />\nunnerving. Although fences divided<br />\nparcels of land everywhere, there was no<br />\nevidence of ownership, of human<br />\nhabitation.<br />\nThe liveliness of 30th Street Station in<br />\nPhiladelphia finally filled my thoughts.<br />\nThe only thing which Philadelphia may<br />\nbe good at, in fact, is curing those rural<br />\nblues. To the inexperienced eye of a<br />\nConnecticut Yankee, Philadelphia is a<br />\nshock. In the first place, 30th Street's<br />\nunderground train boarding area is more<br />\nof a stale, black chasm than Baltimore's.<br />\nCleanliness there is the exception, not the<br />\nrule. Weary young girls peer out of<br />\nbillboards; their smiling at the scene<br />\nreveals their blindness. Getting to<br />\nBethlehem proved to be my next<br />\nproblem.<br />\nUpon learning that I'd just missed a<br />\nbus, couldn't get a local train for hours,<br />\nand was lost, I wandered Philadephia's<br />\ncrowded sidewalks. Feeling more than a<br />\nlittle estranged, I paused at a newsstand<br />\nto by a New Yorker. I began reading it in<br />\na cab to the bus terminal, where I'd<br />\ndecided to grab the next bus. The<br />\nmagazine contained an interesting article<br />\non modern smuggling, written by an<br />\nunnamed marijuana tycoon. As I boarded<br />\nthe Greyhound Sceni-Cruiser for<br />\nBethlehem, I imagined myself<br />\ntransporting such contraband from<br />\nBaltimore to Bethlehem. Minutes later I<br />\nscolded myself for imaging such a thing,<br />\nand closed my eyes.<br />\nUsually arriving at one's destingation is<br />\n<br />\na climactic moment, but when you roll<br />\ninto Bethlehem it's somehow different.<br />\nInstead of the usual wide-eyed wonder<br />\nwith which a stranger greets a new city, I<br />\nhad to strain my eyes to see anything at<br />\nall. Bethelehem is perpetually plagued<br />\nwith emptiness. The bus station in<br />\nBethlehem is a room in one of a handful<br />\nof houses. Traffic lifghts and electric<br />\ndoors at the supermarket draw most of<br />\nthe local attention; folks here are real<br />\nsimple. I called a taxi from the bus<br />\n\"station,\" and fifteen minutes later a car<br />\npulled up to the curb. I had expected at<br />\nleast a cab that was yellow, but when a<br />\nblack, dented, coughing Rambler station<br />\nwagon with a cardboard sign on the side<br />\nsaying \"TAXI\" appeared I looked in the<br />\nother direction.<br />\nActually Bethlehem is considered more<br />\nadvanced than most of Pennsylvania, but<br />\ncoming from the real north, I wasn't<br />\nfooled. For most of the weekend, I<br />\nviewed Bethlehem with a few grains of<br />\niron. From the Lehigh University campus<br />\non a hill, I was shown the source of the<br />\ntown's name. Looking to the east, west,<br />\nor south, I saw nothing but Bethlehem<br />\nSteel and the homes of its workers. I<br />\nreasoned that counting the company's<br />\nsmokestacks would be similar to counting<br />\nall those annoying dots in the ceilings of<br />\nfreshman rooms. The day and a half spent<br />\nin Bethlehem taught me one lesson. Never<br />\nagain will I complain about the lack of<br />\nactivities in Baltimore. BEthlehem's only<br />\nbowling alley is run by a twelve year old<br />\nout of his garage. From my point of<br />\nsuperiority I laughed at Bethlehem, until<br />\nit laughed back.<br />\nI had decided to return to Philadephia<br />\nby local train, walking the short distance<br />\nto the Bethlehem stop. The station was<br />\ndeserted, windows boarded tight,<br />\n<br />\nsidewalks covered by weeds. And I began<br />\nto laugh at Bethlehem some more. A<br />\nsingle train - one of those old models with<br />\ncombined engine and coach - sat on a pair<br />\nof rails. I walked to the rear platform,<br />\nboarded, and asked one of several old<br />\nrailroadmen inside if I was on the train to<br />\nPhilly. \"Ayup,\" he replied; and I took a<br />\nseat a few rows in front of them in the<br />\nempty car.<br />\nAt first I laughed at the men - they<br />\nwere old, looked like cadavers, talked like<br />\nhillbillies, smelt like their farms or<br />\nwhatever. They were all talking about<br />\nwhich train was going to run such and<br />\nsuch a route at such and such a time.<br />\n\"The old 477,\" one old-timer suggested.<br />\n\"Now, she's been laid up for weeks,\"<br />\nanother countered, \"they'll send the Blue<br />\nEagle.\"<br />\nAs their discussion would on,two nuns<br />\nboarded the train. I felt a giggle working<br />\nits way out my lips. The men all rose and<br />\nbowed respectfully to the nuns, offering<br />\nto help in any way on the ride. One of<br />\nthe men escorted the nuns past me<br />\ntoward the front of the train, where they<br />\ntook their seats. I wondered when that<br />\n;tupid Bethlehem train with its<br />\nBethlehem nuns would head for<br />\ncivilization.<br />\nA small boy travelling to Philadelphia<br />\nto see his grandmother Levin was brought<br />\nonto the train by a woman and would the<br />\nconductor please keep an eye on him?<br />\nThe conductor seated the boy across the<br />\naisle- from the nuns and introduced them.<br />\nthat moment, I knew if I wasn't<br />\nAt<br />\ncareful, I'd start laughing at Bethelehem<br />\nagain. The two nuns talked and laughed<br />\nwith the small boy, drying tears that had<br />\nformed when his mother left. As the train<br />\njerked to a start, I heard Bethlehem<br />\natighing at me and I couldn't laugh back.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/november 19, 1976<br />\n<br />\nThe Utilitarian<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\n<br />\nGorgin' at Godfrey's<br />\nEver found yourself<br />\non one of the wrong ends of<br />\ncampus,looking for something to<br />\nreplace those 69 cent Giant<br />\nground beef wonders?

Peter Culman of Center<br />\nStage, spoke on the place of<br />\ntheatre in society, using the<br />\nstatus,: of Greek -theatre as a<br />\nreligious function as well as a<br />\nsocial one, to point out the<br />\nperspective of American theatre.<br />\nGalkin<br />\nElliot Galkin. Professor of<br />\nmusic at JHU and Goucher. and<br />\nmusic critic for the Baltimore<br />\nSun, spoke on the growth of<br />\nmusic in Baltimore. citing that<br />\nwhen he began his duties as the<br />\nSun's. music critic in 1962, there<br />\nwere a mere 60 professional<br />\nmusical events; today,, there are<br />\nover 630. He backed up his<br />\nstatement that Baltimore's<br />\nmusical life was the rnGst<br />\ndeveloped of its cultural activities<br />\nby mentioning that when he was<br />\nin Paris this August. their busy<br />\nseason, he discovered that, \"there<br />\nwas more going on in Baltimore<br />\nthan in Paris. I was amazed!'<br />\nFinally Phoebe Stanton.<br />\nProfessor of Art History here at<br />\nJ1-111: and architecture critic for<br />\nthe Stin,, made the crucial<br />\nstatement. While speaking upon<br />\nGertrude Stein's remark that<br />\n\"you are either ahead of the<br />\nplay, or you are behind it; but<br />\nyou are never evenly with it,\" she<br />\nmade the statement that there<br />\nwas no great art without patrons.<br />\nwas<br />\nThis statement<br />\nimmediately questioned by<br />\nGalkin, who pointed out that<br />\nBeethoven, Schubert, Mozart,<br />\nand Brahms I: to name a few)<br />\nwere fully capable of producing<br />\nsome of the greatest music of all<br />\ntime, without being the members<br />\nof any salon or court, as such<br />\ncourt musicians as Luly , and<br />\nCouperin were.<br />\nAlthough Stanton qualified<br />\nher statement to mean that great<br />\nart cannot be forced to rely<br />\nsolely on the commercial whims<br />\nof timblic fancy, the debate was<br />\non. What and how should the<br />\nsupport of art be? And. if the<br />\npublic's money should be used,<br />\nwho should be responsible to<br />\ndecide how it will be:used?<br />\nWhile dismissing a- great deal of<br />\npublicly commissioned art and<br />\narchitecture as \"civic<br />\ndecoration, ' there were some<br />\nreal problems, the Sugarman,.<br />\ncase being cited as the cause<br />\ncelebre. For those of you who<br />\ndon' t read the local papers, a<br />\nshort his to ry.: the GSA<br />\ncommisioned a sculpture to be<br />\nplaced in front of the new<br />\ndistrict courts building<br />\ndowntown. When the drawings of<br />\nthe proposed sculpture were<br />\npresented to the judges who<br />\nwould inhabit the building,<br />\nseveral felt that the sculpture<br />\nwould be a public hazard.<br />\nenalbing muggers to hide in it<br />\nand attack passers-by. Despite a<br />\nlighting system designed to<br />\neliminate any such risk, the<br />\njudges got a court injunction to<br />\n<br />\nstop the sculpture. The GSA,<br />\nhowever, stuck to its guns, and<br />\nhad the injunction removed when<br />\nit appealed the case.<br />\nEven though it looks as. if the<br />\nSugarman sculpture will be<br />\nplaced in its planned setting. the<br />\ncase was an excellent model for<br />\nthe questions of government<br />\nfunding of the arts. Should there<br />\nbe censorship on the grounds of<br />\n\"the public benefit?\" Or is the<br />\npublic's best interest served in<br />\nwhat Elliot Galkin called.<br />\n\"thinking not only of what the<br />\npublic might want or need today.<br />\nbut also of our responsibility to<br />\nthem two hundred years from<br />\nnow.\" Should the public have a<br />\ndirect say on things like the<br />\nSugarman sculpture. with an<br />\noption tO vote down what they<br />\ndislike, or should the<br />\nresponsibility be turned over to<br />\nthose who are more<br />\n\"knowledgeable?\"<br />\nSparks flew as the discussion<br />\nhedged around that much feared<br />\nword. \"elitism.\" When Staton<br />\nmade the comment about the<br />\nnecessity of Patrons, she used the<br />\nword \"Elite.\" \"We need an<br />\nElite.\" was the thrust of her<br />\nremark; but what is meant by<br />\n\"an Elite?\" The American public<br />\nhas been conditioned to think of<br />\nth \"Elite\" as rich, stuffed shirts<br />\nwearing Alexander Hamilton<br />\nt-shirts, the type who look down<br />\ntheir noses at the rest of us.<br />\n<br />\nmuch \"civic decoration\" coming<br />\nfrom the committees, and this<br />\nwas partly due to their not being<br />\nqualified.<br />\nPrivate patrons can be hard to<br />\ncome by. Peter Culman of Center<br />\nStage mentioned that with the<br />\nsuccess of<br />\nhe Stoops To'<br />\nConquer, Center Stage is riding<br />\nhigh.

There will be a<br />\nbig fuss about Red Ryder'.<br />\npredicted Culmam, people will<br />\nwrite letters condemning it,<br />\npeople will question the right of<br />\nCenter Stage to present such<br />\nthings. How, asked Culman, do<br />\nyou get people to give money<br />\nthen? Those who will be upset<br />\nwill not remember Stoops To:<br />\nConquer., they will only<br />\ncomplain about Red Ryder..<br />\n\"But doesn't Oedipus tearing<br />\nout his eyes on stage upset<br />\nasked Galkin.<br />\npeople?\",<br />\nObviously, no.

All<br />\nin all, it was a good article, with<br />\none exception\u2014the generative<br />\nforce behind the resolution was<br />\nnot Himelfarb, but Davis. Andy<br />\nDavis conceived the idea and<br />\nwrote the resolution to which<br />\nSheldon Himelfarb added one<br />\nsentence. Yet Zelinsky would<br />\nhave us believe that it was<br />\nHimelfarb's dynamism which<br />\ngenerated the resolution. Perhaps<br />\nthis is a result of the way in<br />\nwhich the News-Letter got the<br />\nstory. After they finished the<br />\nresolution (and after Davis had<br />\nleft campus) Himelfarb rushed<br />\nover to the News-Letter with the<br />\nresolution. Suddenly, it is<br />\nHimelfarb with the idea and<br />\nHimelfarb who put in the works.<br />\nThis is truly a case of<br />\nmisrepresentation of the facts.<br />\nWhy didn't Zelinsky try to reach<br />\nDavis for more information and<br />\nany comments? Could it be that<br />\nhe understood the resolution to<br />\nbe Himelfarb's work primarily?<br />\nThroughout the article Andy<br />\nDavis' ideas are attributed to<br />\n<br />\nHimelfarb. Is the News-Letter<br />\ntruly so poor a paper (I think<br />\nnot)or were they merely printing<br />\nthe story the way they got it? It<br />\nappears that the latter is<br />\ntrue)although after the<br />\nBookstore fiasco, I do not<br />\nunderstand why the News-Letter<br />\ncontinues to print \"the gospel<br />\naccording to Himelfarb\". Yes,<br />\nthis is an issue of<br />\nnon-professionalism in reporting.<br />\nA good reporter does not print a<br />\nstory on the basis of facts<br />\nreceived from a questionable<br />\nsource. But more importantly, it<br />\nis an issue concerning ethics\u2014or<br />\nmore precisely, lack of ethics.<br />\nAndy Davis has been done an<br />\ninjustice and has been the victim<br />\nof a piracy of his ideas and work.<br />\n<br />\nThe News -Letter should<br />\nhenceforth use a little more<br />\ncaution in its<br />\nreporting\u2014tempering timing with<br />\ncommon sense.

He<br />\nprobably left Baltimore like I did last<br />\nFriday, wtih no idea as to how he would<br />\never find a small, low-income , rundown<br />\npseudo-city like Bethlehem. Actually, I<br />\ndid have a few obscure ntoions. My first<br />\nstep was to grab a train at Baltimore's<br />\nPenn Station. The sooner that Baltimore<br />\nwould be to my south, the better.<br />\nPenn Station is neither the newest nor<br />\nlargest of Amtrak's city depots, but it's<br />\ngot that Baltimore charm. From its dusty<br />\nhigh ceiling and walls to its usual<br />\nsmorgasbord of pimps, winos, and other<br />\nfolk to avoid, Penn Station gives one a<br />\nfeeling of relief once it disappears from<br />\nview. AFter purchasing the cheapest<br />\nticket for the 11:42 to Philadelphia, I<br />\ndescended to the boarding areas and<br />\nwaited. When the train arrived, I wasted<br />\nno time getting in -- in, out of that urban<br />\nTartarus hidden by the starion. The<br />\noutskirts of Baltimore yielded only street<br />\nscenes and warehouses to my eyes. The<br />\nview bored me. So I surveyed the rest of<br />\nthe car. Businessmen were gathereing to<br />\nsmoke fat cigars and play poker. Families<br />\npicnicked in their seats, Daddy and<br />\nMommy pointing out all the landmarks<br />\nthrough the window. A man across the<br />\naisle, shout but rotund, snored from his<br />\nseat. His hair was graying; his face,<br />\neroding. There was an absence of<br />\nintelligence in his worn, black suit. I<br />\npinned him for one of those European<br />\nimmigrants that huddle with his kind in<br />\ncity tenements. Other passengers were<br />\nwalking between cars, grabbing a beer or<br />\na sandwich in the cafe car. As the train<br />\njiggled towrad Philadelphia, I cursed<br />\nmyself for not making better use of my<br />\ntime and went to sleep. Evidently<br />\ninspired by the magnificence of rail<br />\ntravel, I dreamt of a lightning quick<br />\nprivate train, which resembled a long,<br />\nPorsche Turbo-Carrera, at 300 miles an<br />\nhour. The exterior was done in gold leaf;<br />\nthe interior, in deep. marron velvet and<br />\nteak. Servants were at my feet. Without<br />\nany apparent evidence, I knew that I had<br />\neverything I wanted. The scenery outside<br />\nthe train windows was done in brightly colored neon and animated flying<br />\ncreatures whisked about.<br />\nThe trip to Philadelphia was like a<br />\nChamber of Commerce propaganda<br />\nmovie, or a rural surveyor's map. Through<br />\nthe window on my right, I saw a<br />\nprocession of plants and factories<br />\nparading past the train._ Chrysler<br />\nCorporation, conglomerating all over the<br />\nplace, displayed acres of new cars and<br />\ntrucks. Thousands of assembly - liners<br />\ncould be seen scurrying about. The<br /><br />\nquestion of the factory's environmental<br />\nimpact were unresolved since the well engineered smokestacks disappear about<br />\nhalf way up into a Prestone sky. Various<br />\nchemical companies follow Chrysler in<br />\nthe procession, each in its own shade of<br />\ngray, each with its own smokestack.<br />\nThrough the left window of the train,<br />\nonly an endless array of railroad<br />\nequipment was visible. Spare rails lay<br />\nrusty like scars in the weeds guarding the<br />\nrailroad bed. Empty passenger cars were<br />\npiled everywhere like an urbanrenewal<br />\nproject. Representatives were present<br />\nfrom the B&amp;O, the Reading, the Canadian<br />\nPacific.; the defunct Penn Central, and<br />\nother rail companies I was not familiar_<br />\nwith. Rusted loading cranes rested their<br />\nhuge arms in long - abandoned<br />\nexcavations.<br />\nSoon after leaving Wilmington, the<br />\nrural surveyor's map unfolded before me.<br />\nThere were endless miles of land - just<br />\nland. Nothing was growing; no people in<br />\nsight. If I had been in an airplane, I<br />\nwouldn't have been so distressed;<br />\neverything looks like flat, empty space<br />\nfrom 30,000 feet. But to see such<br />\nemptiness from ground level was<br />\nunnerving. Although fences divided<br />\nparcels of land everywhere, there was no<br />\nevidence of ownership, of human<br />\nhabitation.<br />\nThe liveliness of 30th Street Station in<br />\nPhiladelphia finally filled my thoughts.<br />\nThe only thing which Philadelphia may<br />\nbe good at, in fact, is curing those rural<br />\nblues. To the inexperienced eye of a<br />\nConnecticut Yankee, Philadelphia is a<br />\nshock. In the first place, 30th Street's<br />\nunderground train boarding area is more<br />\nof a stale, black chasm than Baltimore's.<br />\nCleanliness there is the exception, not the<br />\nrule. Weary young girls peer out of<br />\nbillboards; their smiling at the scene<br />\nreveals their blindness. Getting to<br />\nBethlehem proved to be my next<br />\nproblem.<br />\nUpon learning that I'd just missed a<br />\nbus, couldn't get a local train for hours,<br />\nand was lost, I wandered Philadephia's<br />\ncrowded sidewalks. Feeling more than a<br />\nlittle estranged, I paused at a newsstand<br />\nto by a New Yorker. I began reading it in<br />\na cab to the bus terminal, where I'd<br />\ndecided to grab the next bus. The<br />\nmagazine contained an interesting article<br />\non modern smuggling, written by an<br />\nunnamed marijuana tycoon. As I boarded<br />\nthe Greyhound Sceni-Cruiser for<br />\nBethlehem, I imagined myself<br />\ntransporting such contraband from<br />\nBaltimore to Bethlehem. Minutes later I<br />\nscolded myself for imaging such a thing,<br />\nand closed my eyes.<br />\nUsually arriving at one's destingation is<br /><br />\na climactic moment, but when you roll<br />\ninto Bethlehem it's somehow different.<br />\nInstead of the usual wide-eyed wonder<br />\nwith which a stranger greets a new city, I<br />\nhad to strain my eyes to see anything at<br />\nall. Bethelehem is perpetually plagued<br />\nwith emptiness. The bus station in<br />\nBethlehem is a room in one of a handful<br />\nof houses. Traffic lifghts and electric<br />\ndoors at the supermarket draw most of<br />\nthe local attention; folks here are real<br />\nsimple. I called a taxi from the bus<br />\n\"station,\" and fifteen minutes later a car<br />\npulled up to the curb. I had expected at<br />\nleast a cab that was yellow, but when a<br />\nblack, dented, coughing Rambler station<br />\nwagon with a cardboard sign on the side<br />\nsaying \"TAXI\" appeared I looked in the<br />\nother direction.<br />\nActually Bethlehem is considered more<br />\nadvanced than most of Pennsylvania, but<br />\ncoming from the real north, I wasn't<br />\nfooled. For most of the weekend, I<br />\nviewed Bethlehem with a few grains of<br />\niron. From the Lehigh University campus<br />\non a hill, I was shown the source of the<br />\ntown's name. Looking to the east, west,<br />\nor south, I saw nothing but Bethlehem<br />\nSteel and the homes of its workers. I<br />\nreasoned that counting the company's<br />\nsmokestacks would be similar to counting<br />\nall those annoying dots in the ceilings of<br />\nfreshman rooms. The day and a half spent<br />\nin Bethlehem taught me one lesson. Never<br />\nagain will I complain about the lack of<br />\nactivities in Baltimore. BEthlehem's only<br />\nbowling alley is run by a twelve year old<br />\nout of his garage. From my point of<br />\nsuperiority I laughed at Bethlehem, until<br />\nit laughed back.<br />\nI had decided to return to Philadephia<br />\nby local train, walking the short distance<br />\nto the Bethlehem stop. The station was<br />\ndeserted, windows boarded tight,<br /><br />\nsidewalks covered by weeds. And I began<br />\nto laugh at Bethlehem some more. A<br />\nsingle train - one of those old models with<br />\ncombined engine and coach - sat on a pair<br />\nof rails. I walked to the rear platform,<br />\nboarded, and asked one of several old<br />\nrailroadmen inside if I was on the train to<br />\nPhilly. \"Ayup,\" he replied; and I took a<br />\nseat a few rows in front of them in the<br />\nempty car.<br />\nAt first I laughed at the men - they<br />\nwere old, looked like cadavers, talked like<br />\nhillbillies, smelt like their farms or<br />\nwhatever. They were all talking about<br />\nwhich train was going to run such and<br />\nsuch a route at such and such a time.<br />\n\"The old 477,\" one old-timer suggested.<br />\n\"Now, she's been laid up for weeks,\"<br />\nanother countered, \"they'll send the Blue<br />\nEagle.\"<br />\nAs their discussion would on,two nuns<br />\nboarded the train. I felt a giggle working<br />\nits way out my lips. The men all rose and<br />\nbowed respectfully to the nuns, offering<br />\nto help in any way on the ride. One of<br />\nthe men escorted the nuns past me<br />\ntoward the front of the train, where they<br />\ntook their seats. I wondered when that<br />\n;tupid Bethlehem train with its<br />\nBethlehem nuns would head for<br />\ncivilization.<br />\nA small boy travelling to Philadelphia<br />\nto see his grandmother Levin was brought<br />\nonto the train by a woman and would the<br />\nconductor please keep an eye on him?<br />\nThe conductor seated the boy across the<br />\naisle- from the nuns and introduced them.<br />\nthat moment, I knew if I wasn't<br />\nAt<br />\ncareful, I'd start laughing at Bethelehem<br />\nagain. The two nuns talked and laughed<br />\nwith the small boy, drying tears that had<br />\nformed when his mother left. As the train<br />\njerked to a start, I heard Bethlehem<br />\natighing at me and I couldn't laugh back.<br /><br />\npage 2/news-letter/november 19, 1976<br /><br />\nThe Utilitarian<br />\nNews-Letter<br /><br />\nGorgin' at Godfrey's<br />\nEver found yourself<br />\non one of the wrong ends of<br />\ncampus,looking for something to<br />\nreplace those 69 cent Giant<br />\nground beef wonders?

All<br />\nin all, it was a good article, with<br />\none exception\u2014the generative<br />\nforce behind the resolution was<br />\nnot Himelfarb, but Davis. Andy<br />\nDavis conceived the idea and<br />\nwrote the resolution to which<br />\nSheldon Himelfarb added one<br />\nsentence. Yet Zelinsky would<br />\nhave us believe that it was<br />\nHimelfarb's dynamism which<br />\ngenerated the resolution. Perhaps<br />\nthis is a result of the way in<br />\nwhich the News-Letter got the<br />\nstory. After they finished the<br />\nresolution (and after Davis had<br />\nleft campus) Himelfarb rushed<br />\nover to the News-Letter with the<br />\nresolution. Suddenly, it is<br />\nHimelfarb with the idea and<br />\nHimelfarb who put in the works.<br />\nThis is truly a case of<br />\nmisrepresentation of the facts.<br />\nWhy didn't Zelinsky try to reach<br />\nDavis for more information and<br />\nany comments? Could it be that<br />\nhe understood the resolution to<br />\nbe Himelfarb's work primarily?<br />\nThroughout the article Andy<br />\nDavis' ideas are attributed to<br /><br />\nHimelfarb. Is the News-Letter<br />\ntruly so poor a paper (I think<br />\nnot)or were they merely printing<br />\nthe story the way they got it? It<br />\nappears that the latter is<br />\ntrue)although after the<br />\nBookstore fiasco, I do not<br />\nunderstand why the News-Letter<br />\ncontinues to print \"the gospel<br />\naccording to Himelfarb\".
