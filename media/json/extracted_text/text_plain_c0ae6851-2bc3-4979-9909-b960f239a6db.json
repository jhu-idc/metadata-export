The explanation lies in the fact that the Board, composed as it is<br />\nof youthful talent, immature in its judgment, had not realized, when<br />\ngetting out the previous issue, that it was endangering the moral tone<br />\nof the University as a whole. We had made the somewhat pardonable<br />\nmistake of conceiving the purpose of a college paper to be to amuse,<br />\nrather than to instruct, its readers, and, in emulation of such of our<br />\nesteemed contemporaries as the Harvard \"Lampoon,\" the Cornell<br />\n\"Widow,\" and others too numerous to mention, we attempted to<br />\nmake the reading of the previous issue light and amusing, and more radical still, we introduced<br />\na number of cartoons. Unfortunately, however, in so doing, we laid ourselves open to the<br />\nserious charge of being vulgar in our cartoons and \"yellow\" in our written matter; and to<br />\nsuch an extent did we go that pressure was brought to bear in the form of alarmed surprise<br />\nand serious concern from someone \"interested in the welfare of the University.\" Being an<br />\noutsider, and a much older man, the gentleman concerned was in a better position than the<br />\nstudent subscribers, who were, we believe, pleased as a whole with the issue in question, to<br />\nrealize the possible consequences of putting forth from the undergraduates of the Johns Hopkins University a publication as undignified in character as the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nFar from wishing to endanger the moral tone of such a world-renowned institution as the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, we are compelled, contrary as we believe the change to be to the<br />\nwishes of the majority of our subscribers, to hasten back to a more dignified and uplifting level.<br />\nE are glad to see that one of the daily papers has taken notice of the<br />\nStudent Contribution Fund idea advanced by the NEWS-LETTER in<br />\nits last issue; but unfortunately the appreciative daily in question<br />\nmisinterpreted the gist of the idea. The NEWS-LETTER did not<br />\nmean to limit the contributions to the Fund, which is to be used to<br />\nsome good service in the building at Homewood, to yearly appropriations by the graduating classes. On the other hand, we believe that<br />\nmore returns could be realized, with a less burden on the contributors, if every student in the University would contribute a little now<br />\nand then whenever he may chance to have a spare bit of change. We<br />\nopen the Fund column in this issue by a contribution of five dollars from the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nitself. Contributions will be received by the Business Manager of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n.1<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nHE decrease in the study of Latin and Greek in our colleges is very<br />\nmuch to be deplored indeed. The old classical course, which stood for<br />\n\u2022<br />\nit<br />\nso long, seems at last to have been overthrown, and the average college<br />\ngraduate of today does not know whether Aeschylus was an Egyptian<br />\nKing or a Norse Viking. The cry has been raised again and again that<br />\nthe classics are of no practical value, that they are a waste of time.<br />\nWhatever they are, however, they make cultured men, thinking men,<br />\nmen of wider experience, men-of mental calibre, something which the<br />\nstudy of the sciences alone cannot accomplish and never did. Take your<br />\nman with a purelyscie ntific education; he knows his facts pretty well, and<br />\nin due course of time, may attain a mediocre position; but the men who have been forces, who<br />\nhave held the very top, in the scientific world are those whose knowledge was based on a wide<br />\nexperience in the study of the classics. The fallacy lies right here. It is not the scientific<br />\neducation which develops a man's mind, it is a previous thorough training in the classics<br />\nwhich makes him afterward able to profit by such an education. Your little classical pedagogue<br />\nmay be scoffed at, but he has unlimited powers. The small scientific man stops right there.<br />\nIf we abandon everything to opportunism, if we admit that in the hurry and scurry of modern<br />\ntimes there is no time for pure education, drop the classics; but as long as anyone still believes<br />\nin true culture, let us fight to keep them with us.<br />\nift<br />\n2t<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nHE Musical Clubs have gotten their work fairly started. In the last issue<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER an appeal was made to the new students to come<br />\n,.. v v *Iry ww .<br />\nIf\u2022 )0<br />\nw 4,.,<br />\ni,<br />\nout<br />\nfor the Clubs. A number of names were sent in to the leaders of the<br />\nw<br />\nv<br />\nv<br />\nV c Mandolin and Glee Clubs, but when the first rehearsal was held not onew<br />\nw\u2022<br />\nhalf of the candidates put in appearance. Notwithstanding this fact, a<br />\nw<br />\nv.<br />\nvery good practice was held by the Mandolin Club. The Glee Club did<br />\nV<br />\n-0 If<br />\nV<br />\ni<br />\nnot<br />\nmake as good a showing, for there was not more than five men<br />\n:V<br />\nV<br />\n\u2022 VVVVVVVVV<br />\n\u2022<br />\npresent, and the leader was not among them. This must be remedied.<br />\nsF, *, The Musical Clubs cannot exist if the students do not take more interest<br />\nV<br />\nand work more earnestly. We have heard that there is very good<br />\nmaterial among the Freshmen for both Clubs. Now let us see at the next rehearsal every man<br />\nWho sent in his name\u2014and others also.<br />\n<br />\n\"ALMA MATER.\"<br />\nOur Guardian Mother, Queen of Wisdom's sphere,<br />\nThe flaming steeds of princely learning guides;<br />\nAcross the boundless track she daily rides,<br />\nAnd leaves behind a brilliant pathway clear.<br />\nShe pities Wisdom's present darkness drear,<br />\nAnd boldly into Future's workshop strides;<br />\nIntent to see and learn she there abides,<br />\nAnd there to Future's secrets gives she ear.<br />\nShe hears each humble pygmy prayer,<br />\nAnd, hearing, leads us to the living fount,<br />\nWhere rise the Pierian waters wondrous rare;<br />\nAnd bids us each to drink, nor fear to mount<br />\nWhere she would lead, for she, in sooth,<br />\nShall reign forever Queen of perfect truth.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nA SUMMER STORM.<br />\nOf course, the first thing I did after reading<br />\nMarian's letter was to send for jimmy Peters.<br />\nJimmy and I were brothers and classmates at<br />\ncollege, and he has stuck true to me ever<br />\nsince, though our tastes and occupations would<br />\nlead us apart.<br />\n\"Jimmy,\" I began, as soon as he had come<br />\nto me, and had nearly broken my wrists with<br />\nthe old \"frat\" grip, which he always insists<br />\non using\u2014as for myself, I have dropped all<br />\nsuch things long ago\u2014 'Jimmy, I've just had<br />\na letter from my sister which has given me a<br />\ndreadful shock. You know Marian has been<br />\ntravelling and visiting in the West for the past<br />\nsix months, and it appears that she has struck<br />\nup some very doubtful friendships out there.<br />\nI disapproved of the whole trip; however, I<br />\ntrusted that when she came back and we<br />\nopened the old house up in the Maine woods<br />\nfot the summer, her enthusiasm for the West<br />\nwould wane and she would retain nothing<br />\nmore lasting or tangible than a few sentimental recollections.<br />\n\"But oh, Jimmy,\" and my tones grew<br />\ntragic, \"my worst apprehensions fell short<br />\nof the truth. Marian is coming home with<br />\na young woman, from Iowa, Jimmy, one of<br />\nthose common middle Westerners\u2014you know<br />\nthe type\u2014breezy and loud-voiced, and, of<br />\ncourse, with fuzzy yellow hair \u2014 I detest<br />\nblondes! She is, it seems, an orphan with no<br />\nin the world but an older brother. She met<br />\nMarian somewhere through mutual acquaintances, hoodwinked her with some imaginary<br />\ntale of woe, played upon my sister's soft<br />\nheart, and\u2014 is coming East with her to<br />\nspend 'a few weeks' at our old Maine home!<br />\nYou know my dread of women; why, I've<br />\nhardly spoken to a girl for fifteen years, and<br />\nthe prospect of this strange female, intruding<br />\non our quiet summer life is intolerable to me.<br />\nShe will have the place overrun with silly, idle<br />\nboys, she will torture the piano with 'popular'<br />\nmusic, she will upset the whole house, interfere with my work, and be always in the way.<br />\nAnd finally, her name, Jimmy\u2014Lillian\u2014<br />\nLillian Lane! That name spells adventuress;<br />\nI daresay she'll even be wanting to marry me,<br />\nbut she shan't do it, I tell you; I'll not let<br />\nher!\"<br />\n<br />\nI had worked myself into a fine rage.<br />\nJimmy was sympathetic, but had no suggestion to offer. He mildly hinted that Marian's<br />\nnatural refinement and good taste would prevent her from taking up anyone so hopeless<br />\nas I felt this young person to be.<br />\n\"Jimmy,\" I explained testily, \"for a sane<br />\nwoman of thirty-five, my sister takes the<br />\noddest fancies imaginable. I am prepared for<br />\nthe worst.\"<br />\nSo, here I am, doomed to go North in less<br />\nthan a week, and Marian and the young<br />\nwoman arrive about the same time. I have<br />\nthought of all sorts of plans, but there is<br />\nnothing I can do. I am at my wits' end.<br />\nHer hair is red! No, not that insufferable<br />\ncarrotty shade, but still uncompromisingly<br />\nred. When I ungraciously mentioned this<br />\nfact to Marian, she became indignant.<br />\n\"Anthony Carter,\" she cried, \"I'm ashamed<br />\nof you! Lillian's hair is lovely golden bronze,<br />\nsuch as any beauty might envy!\"<br />\n\"Golden bronze!\" I sniffed with contempt.<br />\n\"Anyhow, her eyes are like a china doll's,\" I<br />\nretorted.<br />\nBut Marian was equal to the demands of<br />\nthe occasion. 'They're just like violets,\"<br />\nshe answered calmly.<br />\nViolets, indeed! I'm afraid Marian's imagination is running away with her common<br />\nsense.<br />\nBut I must confess that, on the whole, the<br />\nyoung woman was an agreeable surprise. I<br />\nsuppose I'll have to describe her. She is<br />\nridiculously young\u2014no more than twenty\u2014<br />\nand she dresses always in white\u2014fluffy, ruffiy<br />\nwhite things that make her appear still more<br />\nchildish. As I expected, she spends a great<br />\ndeal of time at the piano, playing and singing<br />\na lot of foolish songs. At first this annoyed<br />\nme and prevented me from writing, but I<br />\nthink I shall get accustomed to it in time.<br />\nHer voice, to my great relief, is gentle and<br />\nrefined.<br />\nShe has, or pretends to have, an interest in<br />\nmy work, and has already plagued me to let<br />\nher into my study and explain to her what I<br />\nam writing.<br />\n\"she begged, \"couldn't you, wouldn't<br />\nyou\u2014just once\u2014let me see some of the books;<br />\nI'd be so grateful!\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nShe opened her eyes wide\u2014a familiar trick<br />\nwith girls, I believe\u2014and looked at me imploringly.<br />\nBut /was not to be imposed upon. \"No,\"<br />\nI said, irritably, \"I can't have you have<br />\nyou prying about my study and disturbing<br />\nme with silly questions. My work is not a<br />\nPastime for children. No; it is impossible.\"<br />\nThen she drew herself up haughtily. \"Oh,\"<br />\nshe said, \"I didn't know you felt that way.<br />\nI didn't understand.\"<br />\nAnd she left the room with her chin up in<br />\nthe air.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThe boys have arrived! I knew it would be<br />\nSO. There is quite a colony of summer cottages and a camp at the other end of the lake,<br />\nand Marian occasionally pays calls over there<br />\nand, I suppose, has introduced the young<br />\nwoman to her friends. Now, there are always<br />\na number of strange canoes in our little boathouse, and strange young men roam about my<br />\ngarden.<br />\nYesterday evening I had gone off to have a<br />\nquiet pipe in the woods\u2014the house is so noisy<br />\nof late I find it impossible to write\u2014and corning home I stumbled over half a dozen of<br />\nthem grouped around her on the veranda,<br />\nmaking the air hideous with wretched harmonies and with the twang and plunk of their<br />\nguitars. She seemed to be enjoying it greatly<br />\nand I heard her irresponsible little giggle as I<br />\nturned up the walk to the house, but when<br />\nshe saw me she stopped laughing suddenly<br />\nand looked solemn. The boys, too, quieted<br />\ndown at sight of me and jumped to their feet<br />\nhalf shyly as I passed into the house.<br />\nBut I went up to my study with a great bitterness at my heart. Was I then such an old<br />\nbear, such a killjoy that these young people<br />\nshould become silent and afraid at sight of me?<br />\nI was hardly forty, yet my own youth had<br />\nbeen dead these fifteen years. Unconsciously<br />\nI pulled open a little drawer, long untouched,<br />\ncontaining some relics of my young days: my<br />\nfrat pins, discarded years ago; a couple of<br />\nloose pages of our college paper\u2014I had been<br />\neditor in my day; a few photographs; a bunch<br />\nof dance programs, tied with a<br />\nbit of ribbon;<br />\nand a faded and broken fan. And,<br />\nas I sat<br />\nthere, old scences came back to me, old faces<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\ncrowded round me, old memories surged over<br />\nme. The little fan I held in my hands\u2014somebody else had held it once\u2014somebody with<br />\nhair like flame and eyes \u2014 ah, yes, like<br />\nviolets! Someone who\u2014ah, come, come,<br />\nnone of that! I closed the drawer and turned<br />\nto my work.<br />\nBut I wrote no more that night.<br />\nYesterday afternoon I was up to my elbows<br />\nin books and papers. rearranging some shelves.<br />\nOutside the storm that had been brewing all<br />\nday had finally broken loose. The rain fell in<br />\nsheets, the lightning and thunder were terrific,<br />\nand our peaceful lake was black and wild.<br />\nSuddenly Marian appeared at the door in<br />\ngreat excitement. \"Anthony,\" she cried, \"I<br />\nam worried to death about Lillian. She went<br />\nout over an hour ago to walk in the woods,<br />\nand though I warned her against the coming<br />\nstorm, she would not listen, and said she<br />\ndidn't mind rain. I don't know what I ought<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nI said something short and to the point, and<br />\ncommented briefly on the perversity of the<br />\nfeminine gender in toto. But I was downstairs before Marian could get in another word,<br />\nand out of the house, snatching up an old<br />\nulster as I ran.<br />\nFor half an hour I hunted through the<br />\nwoods, fighting off the anxiety that, against<br />\nmy will, grew upon me every moment. The<br />\nstorm had now considerably abated, and I<br />\nturned homeward along the lake path, thinking that perhaps she had gotten back to the<br />\nhouse from another direction. And, sure<br />\nenough, as I came in sight of our landing, I<br />\nsaw her coming towards me from the other<br />\nside.<br />\nShe was drenched, of course; the water<br />\ntrickled down off her hair into her face, and<br />\nher white flounces and flim-flams drooped dejectedly.<br />\n\"I was walking and went too far,\" she<br />\nsaid, apologetically; \"the storm came on before<br />\nI was aware of it; I have gotten very wet.\"<br />\nShe looked down at her bedraggled dress and<br />\nthen up at me with a pale little smile\u2014oh,<br />\nthe veriest ghost of her usual giggle. And,<br />\nbefore I could answer\u2014`'Oh,\" she exclaimed,<br />\n\"you're wet, too; you've been walking, too\u2014<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncatching sight of the coat on my arms. \"Did I think I had better be leaving\u2014I'm a bit<br />\nhomesick. I think I want to go home.\"<br />\nyou go out after me?\"<br />\nThen my last bit of control left me, and<br />\nflung<br />\nI<br />\nend.<br />\nBut my endurance was at an<br />\nwords rushed to my lips \"So,\" I cried,<br />\nthe<br />\nfairly<br />\nand<br />\nthe coat around her shoulders,<br />\nis the way you would treat me!

B.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nA LITERARY CENTRE.<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT CONTRIBUTION FUND.<br />\n<br />\nSomeone who has been asked to write the<br />\nliterary history of Baltimore, for one of the<br />\ncritical journals of this country, remarked to<br />\nthe writer that he could not understand why<br />\nthis community had been more or less lacking<br />\nin the pursuit of letters. On reflecting, he<br />\ncame to the conclusion that, apart from the<br />\npersonal element, the chief reason has been<br />\nthat Baltimore has had no center of learning<br />\nuntil the Johns Hopkins University came into<br />\nexistence. It is true that the University of<br />\nMaryland maintained a department of the<br />\nhumanities, but it did not rise to the excellence and influence of its, at one time,<br />\nfamous medical department. This may only<br />\nhave Veen a sign that there was no demand<br />\nfor the department. It is true, that of the<br />\ntwo most prominent literary men, who were<br />\nconnected at some time in their career with<br />\nBaltimore\u2014Poe and Lanier\u2014the latter was<br />\nvery intimately associated with Hopkins.<br />\nBut it seems to many observers that the background, which is obtained at Cambridge and<br />\nOxford, in England, and Harvard, in this<br />\ncountry, is a more stimulating influence on the<br />\nman of letters than is the specializing which<br />\nis characteristic of this and the German Universities. However, there are many of the<br />\nYounger alumni of this institution who are<br />\nnow connected with publishing houses, magazines and other journalistic enterprises, and<br />\nit seems fair to hope that the literary courses<br />\nat Hopkins will continue to develop when<br />\nthe University moves to Homewood. The influence of Hopkins as a literary center is<br />\ngradually spreading through the community,<br />\nand so keen an observer as Henry James<br />\nnoticed it as one of the most potent forces in<br />\nBaltimore. Let him who is interested in this<br />\nphase of Hopkins, read the article in the<br />\nNorth American Review\" by Mr. James and<br />\nhe will indeed take heart.<br />\n<br />\n(Contributions should be sent to Mr. Hermann J.

At anytime of the day you can get him started on<br />\neither of those subjects, and he will even miss<br />\nclasses to tell you how he is worrying his<br />\nbrain to get the Crescent Athletic Club of<br />\nBrooklyn down here next spring. He says,<br />\nthat, with nine men back from the team that<br />\nlined up against Swarthmore last May, he is<br />\nafraid the team will get swelled heads, and<br />\nnot win the championship in 1907. He says,<br />\ntoo, that his thumb is now 0. K., and this is<br />\ndoubtless true, for you no longer see the<br />\nplaster cast as big as a fist.<br />\n\"All's safe, Walter, Harry's in the goal,\"<br />\nwill doubtless be heard again this year, for<br />\nboth Blanck and Schmeisser are again with<br />\nus. Almost any Wednesday afternoon you<br />\nmay see Erlanger sprinting up and down the<br />\ntrack in company with Knipp. Breyer and<br />\nFrank will soon be out with their old white<br />\nhats of last year. Chesney, by the way, is<br />\nsporting a new black and blue skull-cap with<br />\na huge tassel; wasn't she good to make it for<br />\nhim? That reminds one of Raleigh, with his<br />\nassortment of head-gear last year. He has<br />\nbeen seen lately in the cage, making his deft,<br />\nfoxy passes to MacSherry.<br />\nThe team will greatly miss the services of<br />\nMeyer, Dill and Hudgins, and some new men<br />\nmust begotten to fill their places. At present,<br />\nthere seem to be several good men. Everybody seems to be interested in developing<br />\nCharlie Mathias' leg-work. You may sec the<br />\ncaptain and Charlie holding serious consultations which has resulted in the announcement<br />\nthat Mathias will limber up with the track<br />\nteam.<br />\nTo get the best idea of the lacrosse squad,<br />\ngo up in the gym some Tuesday or Thursday<br />\nnight, and watch the track and lacrosse men<br />\ngoing through stunts designed to make them<br />\nbetter runners. The only trouble is, that<br />\nthere are not enough Freshmen out. Wake<br />\nup, 1909! Now is the time to start in on<br />\nstick- and leg-work.<br />\n<br />\nSWARTHMORE WINS.<br />\nThere is more honor, someone has said, in<br />\na hard-fought defeat, than in an easily won<br />\nvictory, and in this respect every Hopkins man<br />\nshould feel proud over the magnificent showing made by the Varsity football team against<br />\nthe unbeaten aggregation from Swarthmore,<br />\nbig hefty beeves, whose 200-pound line kept<br />\nPenn from scoring against it, while at the<br />\nsame time allowing its own quarterback<br />\nO'Brien to drop-kick a goal over Penn's bars.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins did not score on Swarthmore, and although the visitors crossed our<br />\ngoal-line for four touchdowns they were compelled to fight and fight hard for every inch<br />\ngained.<br />\nThe pluck of our lads showed itself especially in the second half, when, worn out and<br />\nbruised by the terrific plunges of the heavy<br />\nvisitors, our men fought even more fiercely<br />\nthan before, keeping the ball down in Swarthmore territory continuously for fifteen minutes.<br />\nThe work of Costello and Ridgely was particularly creditable, and was remarked on by<br />\nseveral Swarthmore players after the game was<br />\nover. Chesney has steadily improved as the<br />\nseason has progressed, and much credit is due<br />\nhim for his work against Swarthmore, several<br />\nfirst-downs being gained by him on quarterback runs.<br />\nWebb played the hardest game of his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins, and only when absolutely<br />\nexhausted by fatigue did he retire to the sidelines. Hart shared honors with Costello, and<br />\ntime and again his speed carried the ball out<br />\nof danger.<br />\nJarvis played a hard plucky game at centre<br />\nthroughout the game, although time and<br />\nagain Swarthmore's heavy backs attacked<br />\nhim.<br />\nFrom the other side, those who witnessed<br />\nthe playing of the visitors, were certainly<br />\ntreated to a rare display of football. Almost<br />\nevery conceivable device permitted under the<br />\nnew rules was tried by the Swarthmore eleven,<br />\nand no one, following the beautiful plays and<br />\nmagnificent team work, would care to dispute<br />\nthe claim of the red-jersied giants to a place in<br />\nthe Big Four class.<br />\nThe wonderful advance which Swarthmore<br />\nhas made in football shows convincingly what<br />\nis possible from a squad which, supported<br />\nheart and soul by the student body as a whole,<br />\nis determined to win out.<br />\nBoys, remember, the student body is heart<br />\nand soul with you in your preparations to<br />\nwipe out the defeat last year at the hand of<br />\nSt. Johns'. Play as hard as you did against<br />\nSwarthmore, and the victory is yours.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHOPKINS, 0\u2014STEVENS, 0.<br />\nMud, and lots of it. That is the whole<br />\nstory of the game with Stevens on October 27.<br />\nFor days before the game there had been a<br />\nsteady downpour, and during frequent intervals Saturday morning it rained. Everyone<br />\nknows the result.<br />\nUrged on by the excited cheers of perhaps<br />\nfifty spectators, the Black and Blue team battled manfully, and bit the mud\u2014literally and<br />\nfiguratively\u2014of a tie game. Hopkins could<br />\nnot score and Stevens could not score. About<br />\nall either team could do was to slip and slide,<br />\nnow on their feet, and now on other portions<br />\nof their anatomy.<br />\nThe team certainly did show much improvement over the way it played against Delaware.<br />\nSeveral of the older men were out, and some<br />\nchanges in the lineup were made that proved<br />\nbeneficial. Moss was seen back at right<br />\nguard, and Captain Preble got in the game at<br />\ncenter in the second half. Roemer, left end,<br />\nhaving left the University, one of the Sawyer's<br />\nwent to his position, while the other Sawyer<br />\nplayed right tackle in place of Haas. Webb<br />\nwas in at full, and Stewart and Abel took<br />\nHart's place.<br />\nThe uncertain footing and the slippery ball<br />\nmade hard work for the backs, especially since<br />\nthe game soon turned out to be a kicking one.<br />\nHere it was that Michael excelled, for the<br />\nHopkins gained on every exchange of punts.<br />\nAgain Chesney was uncertain in handling<br />\nPunts, and will have to take a brace.<br />\nStevens worked a beautiful forward pass for<br />\na good gain of from 20 to 25 yards, but they<br />\ndid not make first down any oftener than did<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt was a pity that the weather was so bad,<br />\nfor it takes money to bring a team down from<br />\nNew York, and a crowd (?) of fifty will not<br />\ngo a long way towards making money on the<br />\ngame.<br />\n<br />\nBig Four crowds at the games will not be<br />\nseen until we get on our field at Homewood<br />\nWith the 'Varsity buildings all around. Do<br />\nYOUR part towards getting there by contributing to the Student Contribution Fund.<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 0\u2014MT. WASHINGTON, 6.<br />\nFor the first time in the history of the<br />\nChair of Football at the Johns Hopkins University the Mt. Washington Football Team<br />\nfrustrated the attempts of the sturdy warriors<br />\nfrom our beloved Alma Mater and defeated<br />\nthem by six points to nothing.<br />\nAs it was, the defeat was accomplished by<br />\nonly a few inches, for had the ball not been<br />\ncarried outside the bounds eight inches from<br />\nthe goal line, the score would have been tied.<br />\nLack of sufficient outdoor practice was in<br />\nthe main part responsible for the defeat, and<br />\nespecially practice in the art of catching the<br />\nball as it descended from its lofty flights<br />\nthrough the atmosphere. Michael was more<br />\nsuccessful than his opponent in bringing the<br />\nleather-covered-spheroid in contact with his<br />\nright pedal extremity, but the Mountaineer<br />\nbacks had greater practice in catching it and,<br />\ntherefore, lost it less often.<br />\nThe Hopkins team played a grand game,<br />\nand in the second half fairly played Mt.<br />\nWashington off their feet. The work of Costello was especially noteworthy, both in<br />\nnegotiating the field with the ball in his arms<br />\nand also in grappling his opponents by the<br />\nlower limbs, thereby bringing them in forciable contact with mother earth. Several of<br />\nthe Mt. Washington heroes were very argumentative in spirit, but unfortunately showed<br />\na tendency to argue with their closed hands<br />\nrather than with their vocal organs. No<br />\nfatal bodily injury followed this tendency, although the ardor of the game resulted in the<br />\nbreaking of another bone in Captain Preble's<br />\nknee.<br />\n<br />\nWHAT THEY EAT.<br />\nThe Banker\u2014Rolls and doughnuts.<br />\nThe Dentist\u2014Pullets.<br />\nThe Ball Player\u2014Batter cakes.<br />\nThe Jeweler\u2014Lady fingers.<br />\nThe Lumberman\u2014Chops.<br />\nThe Actress\u2014Lobsters.<br />\nThe Chef\u2014Bacon.<br />\nThe Surveyor\u2014Steaks.<br />\nThe Broker\u2014Lamb.<br />\nThe Dry Goods Merchant\u2014Flannel cakes.<br />\nThe Dramatic Critic\u2014Roasts.<br />\nThe Chiropodist\u2014Corned beef.<br />\nThe Pittsburg Millionaire\u2014Broilers:<br />\nThe Gambler\u2014Saratoga chips.<br />\nThe Promoter\u2014Watermelon.\u2014Exchange\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nJIM OVERHOLTZ'S RETURN.<br />\nIt was current gossip in Finchville that Jim<br />\nOverholtz had borrowed money to get a marriage license, and, when, after three years of<br />\nteam work in which he carried but a small<br />\nburden of the load on his own neck, he left<br />\nfor other fields, the story was repeated with<br />\ndouble the gusto.<br />\nThe situation at the barber shop conference<br />\nwas dismissed in expressive language. \"As<br />\nlong as Jim had his traces loose he was all<br />\nright on the off side, but the minute Sary tied<br />\nhim to the wheel on the near side, Jim he sort<br />\nof busted the traces.\"<br />\nOne said Jim was bumming his way, another<br />\nthat he was running a side-show at the State<br />\nfair, third and general opinion that he had<br />\njoined the Army.<br />\nNow, Sary played in Finchville and did the<br />\nsame work she had done for three years and<br />\nlonger, and prospered well, having but three<br />\nmouths to feed instead of five, for Jim took<br />\nwith him Loop\u2014boon companion,fellow, goodfor-nothing and dog\u2014a philosopher of the<br />\nsame school.

The explanation lies in the fact that the Board, composed as it is<br />\nof youthful talent, immature in its judgment, had not realized, when<br />\ngetting out the previous issue, that it was endangering the moral tone<br />\nof the University as a whole. We had made the somewhat pardonable<br />\nmistake of conceiving the purpose of a college paper to be to amuse,<br />\nrather than to instruct, its readers, and, in emulation of such of our<br />\nesteemed contemporaries as the Harvard \"Lampoon,\" the Cornell<br />\n\"Widow,\" and others too numerous to mention, we attempted to<br />\nmake the reading of the previous issue light and amusing, and more radical still, we introduced<br />\na number of cartoons. Unfortunately, however, in so doing, we laid ourselves open to the<br />\nserious charge of being vulgar in our cartoons and \"yellow\" in our written matter; and to<br />\nsuch an extent did we go that pressure was brought to bear in the form of alarmed surprise<br />\nand serious concern from someone \"interested in the welfare of the University.\" Being an<br />\noutsider, and a much older man, the gentleman concerned was in a better position than the<br />\nstudent subscribers, who were, we believe, pleased as a whole with the issue in question, to<br />\nrealize the possible consequences of putting forth from the undergraduates of the Johns Hopkins University a publication as undignified in character as the last issue of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nFar from wishing to endanger the moral tone of such a world-renowned institution as the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University, we are compelled, contrary as we believe the change to be to the<br />\nwishes of the majority of our subscribers, to hasten back to a more dignified and uplifting level.<br />\nE are glad to see that one of the daily papers has taken notice of the<br />\nStudent Contribution Fund idea advanced by the NEWS-LETTER in<br />\nits last issue; but unfortunately the appreciative daily in question<br />\nmisinterpreted the gist of the idea. The NEWS-LETTER did not<br />\nmean to limit the contributions to the Fund, which is to be used to<br />\nsome good service in the building at Homewood, to yearly appropriations by the graduating classes. On the other hand, we believe that<br />\nmore returns could be realized, with a less burden on the contributors, if every student in the University would contribute a little now<br />\nand then whenever he may chance to have a spare bit of change. We<br />\nopen the Fund column in this issue by a contribution of five dollars from the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nitself. Contributions will be received by the Business Manager of the NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n.1<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nHE decrease in the study of Latin and Greek in our colleges is very<br />\nmuch to be deplored indeed. The old classical course, which stood for<br />\n\u2022<br />\nit<br />\nso long, seems at last to have been overthrown, and the average college<br />\ngraduate of today does not know whether Aeschylus was an Egyptian<br />\nKing or a Norse Viking. The cry has been raised again and again that<br />\nthe classics are of no practical value, that they are a waste of time.<br />\nWhatever they are, however, they make cultured men, thinking men,<br />\nmen of wider experience, men-of mental calibre, something which the<br />\nstudy of the sciences alone cannot accomplish and never did. Take your<br />\nman with a purelyscie ntific education; he knows his facts pretty well, and<br />\nin due course of time, may attain a mediocre position; but the men who have been forces, who<br />\nhave held the very top, in the scientific world are those whose knowledge was based on a wide<br />\nexperience in the study of the classics. The fallacy lies right here. It is not the scientific<br />\neducation which develops a man's mind, it is a previous thorough training in the classics<br />\nwhich makes him afterward able to profit by such an education. Your little classical pedagogue<br />\nmay be scoffed at, but he has unlimited powers. The small scientific man stops right there.<br />\nIf we abandon everything to opportunism, if we admit that in the hurry and scurry of modern<br />\ntimes there is no time for pure education, drop the classics; but as long as anyone still believes<br />\nin true culture, let us fight to keep them with us.<br />\nift<br />\n2t<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\n\"<br />\n.<br /><br />\nV<br /><br />\nHE Musical Clubs have gotten their work fairly started. In the last issue<br />\nof the NEWS-LETTER an appeal was made to the new students to come<br />\n,.. v v *Iry ww .<br />\nIf\u2022 )0<br />\nw 4,.,<br />\ni,<br />\nout<br />\nfor the Clubs. A number of names were sent in to the leaders of the<br />\nw<br />\nv<br />\nv<br />\nV c Mandolin and Glee Clubs, but when the first rehearsal was held not onew<br />\nw\u2022<br />\nhalf of the candidates put in appearance. Notwithstanding this fact, a<br />\nw<br />\nv.<br />\nvery good practice was held by the Mandolin Club. The Glee Club did<br />\nV<br />\n-0 If<br />\nV<br />\ni<br />\nnot<br />\nmake as good a showing, for there was not more than five men<br />\n:V<br />\nV<br />\n\u2022 VVVVVVVVV<br />\n\u2022<br />\npresent, and the leader was not among them. This must be remedied.<br />\nsF, *, The Musical Clubs cannot exist if the students do not take more interest<br />\nV<br />\nand work more earnestly. We have heard that there is very good<br />\nmaterial among the Freshmen for both Clubs. Now let us see at the next rehearsal every man<br />\nWho sent in his name\u2014and others also.<br /><br />\n\"ALMA MATER.\"<br />\nOur Guardian Mother, Queen of Wisdom's sphere,<br />\nThe flaming steeds of princely learning guides;<br />\nAcross the boundless track she daily rides,<br />\nAnd leaves behind a brilliant pathway clear.<br />\nShe pities Wisdom's present darkness drear,<br />\nAnd boldly into Future's workshop strides;<br />\nIntent to see and learn she there abides,<br />\nAnd there to Future's secrets gives she ear.<br />\nShe hears each humble pygmy prayer,<br />\nAnd, hearing, leads us to the living fount,<br />\nWhere rise the Pierian waters wondrous rare;<br />\nAnd bids us each to drink, nor fear to mount<br />\nWhere she would lead, for she, in sooth,<br />\nShall reign forever Queen of perfect truth.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nA SUMMER STORM.<br />\nOf course, the first thing I did after reading<br />\nMarian's letter was to send for jimmy Peters.<br />\nJimmy and I were brothers and classmates at<br />\ncollege, and he has stuck true to me ever<br />\nsince, though our tastes and occupations would<br />\nlead us apart.<br />\n\"Jimmy,\" I began, as soon as he had come<br />\nto me, and had nearly broken my wrists with<br />\nthe old \"frat\" grip, which he always insists<br />\non using\u2014as for myself, I have dropped all<br />\nsuch things long ago\u2014 'Jimmy, I've just had<br />\na letter from my sister which has given me a<br />\ndreadful shock. You know Marian has been<br />\ntravelling and visiting in the West for the past<br />\nsix months, and it appears that she has struck<br />\nup some very doubtful friendships out there.<br />\nI disapproved of the whole trip; however, I<br />\ntrusted that when she came back and we<br />\nopened the old house up in the Maine woods<br />\nfot the summer, her enthusiasm for the West<br />\nwould wane and she would retain nothing<br />\nmore lasting or tangible than a few sentimental recollections.<br />\n\"But oh, Jimmy,\" and my tones grew<br />\ntragic, \"my worst apprehensions fell short<br />\nof the truth. Marian is coming home with<br />\na young woman, from Iowa, Jimmy, one of<br />\nthose common middle Westerners\u2014you know<br />\nthe type\u2014breezy and loud-voiced, and, of<br />\ncourse, with fuzzy yellow hair \u2014 I detest<br />\nblondes! She is, it seems, an orphan with no<br />\nin the world but an older brother. She met<br />\nMarian somewhere through mutual acquaintances, hoodwinked her with some imaginary<br />\ntale of woe, played upon my sister's soft<br />\nheart, and\u2014 is coming East with her to<br />\nspend 'a few weeks' at our old Maine home!<br />\nYou know my dread of women; why, I've<br />\nhardly spoken to a girl for fifteen years, and<br />\nthe prospect of this strange female, intruding<br />\non our quiet summer life is intolerable to me.<br />\nShe will have the place overrun with silly, idle<br />\nboys, she will torture the piano with 'popular'<br />\nmusic, she will upset the whole house, interfere with my work, and be always in the way.<br />\nAnd finally, her name, Jimmy\u2014Lillian\u2014<br />\nLillian Lane! That name spells adventuress;<br />\nI daresay she'll even be wanting to marry me,<br />\nbut she shan't do it, I tell you; I'll not let<br />\nher!\"<br /><br />\nI had worked myself into a fine rage.<br />\nJimmy was sympathetic, but had no suggestion to offer. He mildly hinted that Marian's<br />\nnatural refinement and good taste would prevent her from taking up anyone so hopeless<br />\nas I felt this young person to be.<br />\n\"Jimmy,\" I explained testily, \"for a sane<br />\nwoman of thirty-five, my sister takes the<br />\noddest fancies imaginable. I am prepared for<br />\nthe worst.\"<br />\nSo, here I am, doomed to go North in less<br />\nthan a week, and Marian and the young<br />\nwoman arrive about the same time. I have<br />\nthought of all sorts of plans, but there is<br />\nnothing I can do. I am at my wits' end.<br />\nHer hair is red! No, not that insufferable<br />\ncarrotty shade, but still uncompromisingly<br />\nred. When I ungraciously mentioned this<br />\nfact to Marian, she became indignant.<br />\n\"Anthony Carter,\" she cried, \"I'm ashamed<br />\nof you! Lillian's hair is lovely golden bronze,<br />\nsuch as any beauty might envy!\"<br />\n\"Golden bronze!\" I sniffed with contempt.<br />\n\"Anyhow, her eyes are like a china doll's,\" I<br />\nretorted.<br />\nBut Marian was equal to the demands of<br />\nthe occasion. 'They're just like violets,\"<br />\nshe answered calmly.<br />\nViolets, indeed! I'm afraid Marian's imagination is running away with her common<br />\nsense.<br />\nBut I must confess that, on the whole, the<br />\nyoung woman was an agreeable surprise. I<br />\nsuppose I'll have to describe her. She is<br />\nridiculously young\u2014no more than twenty\u2014<br />\nand she dresses always in white\u2014fluffy, ruffiy<br />\nwhite things that make her appear still more<br />\nchildish. As I expected, she spends a great<br />\ndeal of time at the piano, playing and singing<br />\na lot of foolish songs. At first this annoyed<br />\nme and prevented me from writing, but I<br />\nthink I shall get accustomed to it in time.<br />\nHer voice, to my great relief, is gentle and<br />\nrefined.<br />\nShe has, or pretends to have, an interest in<br />\nmy work, and has already plagued me to let<br />\nher into my study and explain to her what I<br />\nam writing.<br />\n\"she begged, \"couldn't you, wouldn't<br />\nyou\u2014just once\u2014let me see some of the books;<br />\nI'd be so grateful!\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nShe opened her eyes wide\u2014a familiar trick<br />\nwith girls, I believe\u2014and looked at me imploringly.<br />\nBut /was not to be imposed upon. \"No,\"<br />\nI said, irritably, \"I can't have you have<br />\nyou prying about my study and disturbing<br />\nme with silly questions. My work is not a<br />\nPastime for children. No; it is impossible.\"<br />\nThen she drew herself up haughtily. \"Oh,\"<br />\nshe said, \"I didn't know you felt that way.<br />\nI didn't understand.\"<br />\nAnd she left the room with her chin up in<br />\nthe air.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nThe boys have arrived! I knew it would be<br />\nSO. There is quite a colony of summer cottages and a camp at the other end of the lake,<br />\nand Marian occasionally pays calls over there<br />\nand, I suppose, has introduced the young<br />\nwoman to her friends. Now, there are always<br />\na number of strange canoes in our little boathouse, and strange young men roam about my<br />\ngarden.<br />\nYesterday evening I had gone off to have a<br />\nquiet pipe in the woods\u2014the house is so noisy<br />\nof late I find it impossible to write\u2014and corning home I stumbled over half a dozen of<br />\nthem grouped around her on the veranda,<br />\nmaking the air hideous with wretched harmonies and with the twang and plunk of their<br />\nguitars. She seemed to be enjoying it greatly<br />\nand I heard her irresponsible little giggle as I<br />\nturned up the walk to the house, but when<br />\nshe saw me she stopped laughing suddenly<br />\nand looked solemn. The boys, too, quieted<br />\ndown at sight of me and jumped to their feet<br />\nhalf shyly as I passed into the house.<br />\nBut I went up to my study with a great bitterness at my heart. Was I then such an old<br />\nbear, such a killjoy that these young people<br />\nshould become silent and afraid at sight of me?<br />\nI was hardly forty, yet my own youth had<br />\nbeen dead these fifteen years. Unconsciously<br />\nI pulled open a little drawer, long untouched,<br />\ncontaining some relics of my young days: my<br />\nfrat pins, discarded years ago; a couple of<br />\nloose pages of our college paper\u2014I had been<br />\neditor in my day; a few photographs; a bunch<br />\nof dance programs, tied with a<br />\nbit of ribbon;<br />\nand a faded and broken fan. And,<br />\nas I sat<br />\nthere, old scences came back to me, old faces<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\ncrowded round me, old memories surged over<br />\nme. The little fan I held in my hands\u2014somebody else had held it once\u2014somebody with<br />\nhair like flame and eyes \u2014 ah, yes, like<br />\nviolets! Someone who\u2014ah, come, come,<br />\nnone of that! I closed the drawer and turned<br />\nto my work.<br />\nBut I wrote no more that night.<br />\nYesterday afternoon I was up to my elbows<br />\nin books and papers. rearranging some shelves.<br />\nOutside the storm that had been brewing all<br />\nday had finally broken loose. The rain fell in<br />\nsheets, the lightning and thunder were terrific,<br />\nand our peaceful lake was black and wild.<br />\nSuddenly Marian appeared at the door in<br />\ngreat excitement. \"Anthony,\" she cried, \"I<br />\nam worried to death about Lillian. She went<br />\nout over an hour ago to walk in the woods,<br />\nand though I warned her against the coming<br />\nstorm, she would not listen, and said she<br />\ndidn't mind rain. I don't know what I ought<br />\nto do.\"<br />\nI said something short and to the point, and<br />\ncommented briefly on the perversity of the<br />\nfeminine gender in toto. But I was downstairs before Marian could get in another word,<br />\nand out of the house, snatching up an old<br />\nulster as I ran.<br />\nFor half an hour I hunted through the<br />\nwoods, fighting off the anxiety that, against<br />\nmy will, grew upon me every moment. The<br />\nstorm had now considerably abated, and I<br />\nturned homeward along the lake path, thinking that perhaps she had gotten back to the<br />\nhouse from another direction. And, sure<br />\nenough, as I came in sight of our landing, I<br />\nsaw her coming towards me from the other<br />\nside.<br />\nShe was drenched, of course; the water<br />\ntrickled down off her hair into her face, and<br />\nher white flounces and flim-flams drooped dejectedly.<br />\n\"I was walking and went too far,\" she<br />\nsaid, apologetically; \"the storm came on before<br />\nI was aware of it; I have gotten very wet.\"<br />\nShe looked down at her bedraggled dress and<br />\nthen up at me with a pale little smile\u2014oh,<br />\nthe veriest ghost of her usual giggle. And,<br />\nbefore I could answer\u2014`'Oh,\" she exclaimed,<br />\n\"you're wet, too; you've been walking, too\u2014<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncatching sight of the coat on my arms. \"Did I think I had better be leaving\u2014I'm a bit<br />\nhomesick.

B.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nA LITERARY CENTRE.<br /><br />\nSTUDENT CONTRIBUTION FUND.<br /><br />\nSomeone who has been asked to write the<br />\nliterary history of Baltimore, for one of the<br />\ncritical journals of this country, remarked to<br />\nthe writer that he could not understand why<br />\nthis community had been more or less lacking<br />\nin the pursuit of letters. On reflecting, he<br />\ncame to the conclusion that, apart from the<br />\npersonal element, the chief reason has been<br />\nthat Baltimore has had no center of learning<br />\nuntil the Johns Hopkins University came into<br />\nexistence. It is true that the University of<br />\nMaryland maintained a department of the<br />\nhumanities, but it did not rise to the excellence and influence of its, at one time,<br />\nfamous medical department. This may only<br />\nhave Veen a sign that there was no demand<br />\nfor the department. It is true, that of the<br />\ntwo most prominent literary men, who were<br />\nconnected at some time in their career with<br />\nBaltimore\u2014Poe and Lanier\u2014the latter was<br />\nvery intimately associated with Hopkins.<br />\nBut it seems to many observers that the background, which is obtained at Cambridge and<br />\nOxford, in England, and Harvard, in this<br />\ncountry, is a more stimulating influence on the<br />\nman of letters than is the specializing which<br />\nis characteristic of this and the German Universities. However, there are many of the<br />\nYounger alumni of this institution who are<br />\nnow connected with publishing houses, magazines and other journalistic enterprises, and<br />\nit seems fair to hope that the literary courses<br />\nat Hopkins will continue to develop when<br />\nthe University moves to Homewood. The influence of Hopkins as a literary center is<br />\ngradually spreading through the community,<br />\nand so keen an observer as Henry James<br />\nnoticed it as one of the most potent forces in<br />\nBaltimore. Let him who is interested in this<br />\nphase of Hopkins, read the article in the<br />\nNorth American Review\" by Mr. James and<br />\nhe will indeed take heart.<br /><br />\n(Contributions should be sent to Mr. Hermann J.

At anytime of the day you can get him started on<br />\neither of those subjects, and he will even miss<br />\nclasses to tell you how he is worrying his<br />\nbrain to get the Crescent Athletic Club of<br />\nBrooklyn down here next spring. He says,<br />\nthat, with nine men back from the team that<br />\nlined up against Swarthmore last May, he is<br />\nafraid the team will get swelled heads, and<br />\nnot win the championship in 1907. He says,<br />\ntoo, that his thumb is now 0. K., and this is<br />\ndoubtless true, for you no longer see the<br />\nplaster cast as big as a fist.<br />\n\"All's safe, Walter, Harry's in the goal,\"<br />\nwill doubtless be heard again this year, for<br />\nboth Blanck and Schmeisser are again with<br />\nus. Almost any Wednesday afternoon you<br />\nmay see Erlanger sprinting up and down the<br />\ntrack in company with Knipp. Breyer and<br />\nFrank will soon be out with their old white<br />\nhats of last year. Chesney, by the way, is<br />\nsporting a new black and blue skull-cap with<br />\na huge tassel; wasn't she good to make it for<br />\nhim? That reminds one of Raleigh, with his<br />\nassortment of head-gear last year. He has<br />\nbeen seen lately in the cage, making his deft,<br />\nfoxy passes to MacSherry.<br />\nThe team will greatly miss the services of<br />\nMeyer, Dill and Hudgins, and some new men<br />\nmust begotten to fill their places. At present,<br />\nthere seem to be several good men. Everybody seems to be interested in developing<br />\nCharlie Mathias' leg-work. You may sec the<br />\ncaptain and Charlie holding serious consultations which has resulted in the announcement<br />\nthat Mathias will limber up with the track<br />\nteam.<br />\nTo get the best idea of the lacrosse squad,<br />\ngo up in the gym some Tuesday or Thursday<br />\nnight, and watch the track and lacrosse men<br />\ngoing through stunts designed to make them<br />\nbetter runners. The only trouble is, that<br />\nthere are not enough Freshmen out. Wake<br />\nup, 1909! Now is the time to start in on<br />\nstick- and leg-work.<br /><br />\nSWARTHMORE WINS.<br />\nThere is more honor, someone has said, in<br />\na hard-fought defeat, than in an easily won<br />\nvictory, and in this respect every Hopkins man<br />\nshould feel proud over the magnificent showing made by the Varsity football team against<br />\nthe unbeaten aggregation from Swarthmore,<br />\nbig hefty beeves, whose 200-pound line kept<br />\nPenn from scoring against it, while at the<br />\nsame time allowing its own quarterback<br />\nO'Brien to drop-kick a goal over Penn's bars.<br />\nAlthough Hopkins did not score on Swarthmore, and although the visitors crossed our<br />\ngoal-line for four touchdowns they were compelled to fight and fight hard for every inch<br />\ngained.<br />\nThe pluck of our lads showed itself especially in the second half, when, worn out and<br />\nbruised by the terrific plunges of the heavy<br />\nvisitors, our men fought even more fiercely<br />\nthan before, keeping the ball down in Swarthmore territory continuously for fifteen minutes.<br />\nThe work of Costello and Ridgely was particularly creditable, and was remarked on by<br />\nseveral Swarthmore players after the game was<br />\nover. Chesney has steadily improved as the<br />\nseason has progressed, and much credit is due<br />\nhim for his work against Swarthmore, several<br />\nfirst-downs being gained by him on quarterback runs.<br />\nWebb played the hardest game of his<br />\ncareer at Hopkins, and only when absolutely<br />\nexhausted by fatigue did he retire to the sidelines. Hart shared honors with Costello, and<br />\ntime and again his speed carried the ball out<br />\nof danger.<br />\nJarvis played a hard plucky game at centre<br />\nthroughout the game, although time and<br />\nagain Swarthmore's heavy backs attacked<br />\nhim.<br />\nFrom the other side, those who witnessed<br />\nthe playing of the visitors, were certainly<br />\ntreated to a rare display of football. Almost<br />\nevery conceivable device permitted under the<br />\nnew rules was tried by the Swarthmore eleven,<br />\nand no one, following the beautiful plays and<br />\nmagnificent team work, would care to dispute<br />\nthe claim of the red-jersied giants to a place in<br />\nthe Big Four class.<br />\nThe wonderful advance which Swarthmore<br />\nhas made in football shows convincingly what<br />\nis possible from a squad which, supported<br />\nheart and soul by the student body as a whole,<br />\nis determined to win out.<br />\nBoys, remember, the student body is heart<br />\nand soul with you in your preparations to<br />\nwipe out the defeat last year at the hand of<br />\nSt. Johns'. Play as hard as you did against<br />\nSwarthmore, and the victory is yours.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nHOPKINS, 0\u2014STEVENS, 0.<br />\nMud, and lots of it. That is the whole<br />\nstory of the game with Stevens on October 27.<br />\nFor days before the game there had been a<br />\nsteady downpour, and during frequent intervals Saturday morning it rained. Everyone<br />\nknows the result.<br />\nUrged on by the excited cheers of perhaps<br />\nfifty spectators, the Black and Blue team battled manfully, and bit the mud\u2014literally and<br />\nfiguratively\u2014of a tie game. Hopkins could<br />\nnot score and Stevens could not score. About<br />\nall either team could do was to slip and slide,<br />\nnow on their feet, and now on other portions<br />\nof their anatomy.<br />\nThe team certainly did show much improvement over the way it played against Delaware.<br />\nSeveral of the older men were out, and some<br />\nchanges in the lineup were made that proved<br />\nbeneficial. Moss was seen back at right<br />\nguard, and Captain Preble got in the game at<br />\ncenter in the second half. Roemer, left end,<br />\nhaving left the University, one of the Sawyer's<br />\nwent to his position, while the other Sawyer<br />\nplayed right tackle in place of Haas. Webb<br />\nwas in at full, and Stewart and Abel took<br />\nHart's place.<br />\nThe uncertain footing and the slippery ball<br />\nmade hard work for the backs, especially since<br />\nthe game soon turned out to be a kicking one.<br />\nHere it was that Michael excelled, for the<br />\nHopkins gained on every exchange of punts.<br />\nAgain Chesney was uncertain in handling<br />\nPunts, and will have to take a brace.<br />\nStevens worked a beautiful forward pass for<br />\na good gain of from 20 to 25 yards, but they<br />\ndid not make first down any oftener than did<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nIt was a pity that the weather was so bad,<br />\nfor it takes money to bring a team down from<br />\nNew York, and a crowd (?) of fifty will not<br />\ngo a long way towards making money on the<br />\ngame.<br /><br />\nBig Four crowds at the games will not be<br />\nseen until we get on our field at Homewood<br />\nWith the 'Varsity buildings all around. Do<br />\nYOUR part towards getting there by contributing to the Student Contribution Fund.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 0\u2014MT. WASHINGTON, 6.<br />\nFor the first time in the history of the<br />\nChair of Football at the Johns Hopkins University the Mt. Washington Football Team<br />\nfrustrated the attempts of the sturdy warriors<br />\nfrom our beloved Alma Mater and defeated<br />\nthem by six points to nothing.<br />\nAs it was, the defeat was accomplished by<br />\nonly a few inches, for had the ball not been<br />\ncarried outside the bounds eight inches from<br />\nthe goal line, the score would have been tied.<br />\nLack of sufficient outdoor practice was in<br />\nthe main part responsible for the defeat, and<br />\nespecially practice in the art of catching the<br />\nball as it descended from its lofty flights<br />\nthrough the atmosphere. Michael was more<br />\nsuccessful than his opponent in bringing the<br />\nleather-covered-spheroid in contact with his<br />\nright pedal extremity, but the Mountaineer<br />\nbacks had greater practice in catching it and,<br />\ntherefore, lost it less often.<br />\nThe Hopkins team played a grand game,<br />\nand in the second half fairly played Mt.<br />\nWashington off their feet. The work of Costello was especially noteworthy, both in<br />\nnegotiating the field with the ball in his arms<br />\nand also in grappling his opponents by the<br />\nlower limbs, thereby bringing them in forciable contact with mother earth. Several of<br />\nthe Mt. Washington heroes were very argumentative in spirit, but unfortunately showed<br />\na tendency to argue with their closed hands<br />\nrather than with their vocal organs. No<br />\nfatal bodily injury followed this tendency, although the ardor of the game resulted in the<br />\nbreaking of another bone in Captain Preble's<br />\nknee.<br /><br />\nWHAT THEY EAT.<br />\nThe Banker\u2014Rolls and doughnuts.<br />\nThe Dentist\u2014Pullets.<br />\nThe Ball Player\u2014Batter cakes.<br />\nThe Jeweler\u2014Lady fingers.<br />\nThe Lumberman\u2014Chops.<br />\nThe Actress\u2014Lobsters.<br />\nThe Chef\u2014Bacon.<br />\nThe Surveyor\u2014Steaks.<br />\nThe Broker\u2014Lamb.<br />\nThe Dry Goods Merchant\u2014Flannel cakes.<br />\nThe Dramatic Critic\u2014Roasts.<br />\nThe Chiropodist\u2014Corned beef.<br />\nThe Pittsburg Millionaire\u2014Broilers:<br />\nThe Gambler\u2014Saratoga chips.<br />\nThe Promoter\u2014Watermelon.\u2014Exchange\u2022<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nJIM OVERHOLTZ'S RETURN.<br />\nIt was current gossip in Finchville that Jim<br />\nOverholtz had borrowed money to get a marriage license, and, when, after three years of<br />\nteam work in which he carried but a small<br />\nburden of the load on his own neck, he left<br />\nfor other fields, the story was repeated with<br />\ndouble the gusto.<br />\nThe situation at the barber shop conference<br />\nwas dismissed in expressive language. \"As<br />\nlong as Jim had his traces loose he was all<br />\nright on the off side, but the minute Sary tied<br />\nhim to the wheel on the near side, Jim he sort<br />\nof busted the traces.\"<br />\nOne said Jim was bumming his way, another<br />\nthat he was running a side-show at the State<br />\nfair, third and general opinion that he had<br />\njoined the Army.<br />\nNow, Sary played in Finchville and did the<br />\nsame work she had done for three years and<br />\nlonger, and prospered well, having but three<br />\nmouths to feed instead of five, for Jim took<br />\nwith him Loop\u2014boon companion,fellow, goodfor-nothing and dog\u2014a philosopher of the<br />\nsame school.
