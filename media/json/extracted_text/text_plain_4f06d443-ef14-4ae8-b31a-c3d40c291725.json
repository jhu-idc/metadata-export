Each engineer, how-<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\never, is invaluable because this truly new high-performance airplane is only the<br />\nfinal result of the creative thought and teamwork of a large number of engineers.<br />\nThe individual ideas of each engineer are most<br />\nimportant. In aircraft design, the time lag between<br />\ndiscovery and the utilization of knowledge is<br />\nextremely short, shorter perhaps than in any other<br />\nmajor industry. The solutions to the most stimulating problems which arise in the industry are<br />\nfrequently dependent upon the daily utilization of<br />\nnew ideas and new knowledge.<br />\nThe graduating engineer considering his first<br />\ncareer decision may choose whether he will enter<br />\nthis field of work \u2014 the design of airplanes and<br />\nmissiles \u2014 that progresses hand in hand with new<br />\ndiscoveries in all facets of science and engineering,<br />\nor choose a less aggressive industry. Of course, it<br />\nfollows logically that greater and more rapid advancement opportunities lie in a field that does not<br />\nstagnate, in a field that is bounded by the creative<br />\nimagination of man alone. At Chance Vought, aircraft design draws capable engineers to positions<br />\nof greater responsibility in developing new ideas<br />\nand supervising the additional technical manpower<br />\nneeded to \"practicalize\" the ideas. Starting salaries are commensurate with education and experience for particular specialization and are also<br />\ncompetitive with other industries as well as<br />\nother companies. Advancement, as one would<br />\n<br />\nexpect, is based upon demonstrated performance,<br />\nnot seniority.<br />\nThe future of the aircraft industry is equal to, if<br />\nnot brighter than, that of other industries. The<br />\ncomplexity of modern aircraft and missiles, the<br />\ninvestigation of new fields of knowledge as aircraft fly higher and faster, the possibilities of<br />\nman's further use of science and engineering for<br />\nconquest of the air in the second half of the 20th<br />\ncentury, all emphasize the challenge and opportunity to the young graduate.<br />\nWe urge the graduating engineer to investigate<br />\nthese opportunities at Chance Vought. He will<br />\nfind a stable, 38-year-old aircraft designer and<br />\nbuilder with young ideas, a designer and builder<br />\nnoted for advancing the state-of-the-art of aircraft and guided missile design. He will discover<br />\nthat Chance Vought offers career opportunities,<br />\nnot merely impressive titles, and that he will<br />\njoin an engineering organization that thinks<br />\nand operates as a team rather than as a random<br />\ncollection of individual engineers.<br />\nWe have the usual fringe benefits including an excellent graduate study program, group insurance,<br />\nretirement income plan, paid vacation, sick leave,<br />\nmoving allowance, and numerous paid holidays.<br />\n<br />\nWe invite you to discuss your opportunities at Chance Vought with<br />\nW.

Morgan,<br />\nmember of the Department of<br />\nPsychology, has announced that<br />\nhe will resign from the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty after the first term of<br />\nthe 1956-57 academic year in order to devote full time to his writings.<br />\nProfessor Morgan has been a<br />\nmember of the Hopkins faculty<br />\nsince 1943, and he was appointed<br />\nto his present professorship in<br />\n1948. At this time, no successor<br />\nhas been named by the University<br />\nadministration.<br />\nDr. Morgan said that the reason<br />\nfor his resignation is a \"rather<br />\nunique story, but simplified it<br />\namounts to the fact that I hold<br />\ntwo full time jobs; I can't do both,<br />\nso I must make a choice between<br />\nthem.\" The first, and more obvious<br />\nof his full time occupations is<br />\nteaching. Dr. Morgan spends his<br />\n\"spare\" tme writing and editing<br />\nin the field of psychology. His<br />\nfourth book, a text for introductory psychology instruction, will<br />\nbe published next month and will<br />\n<br />\nbe used by the Hopkns Introductory Psychology course next year.<br />\nTo Revise Books<br />\nDuring the next four years, Dr.<br />\nMorgan must also revise his<br />\nphysiological psychology text book<br />\nand begin work on the second<br />\nedition of his newest publication.<br />\nThe first printing of the book will<br />\nconsist of 50,000 copies.<br />\nBoth he and the publishers<br />\n(McGraw Hill) expect the text to<br />\nbe \"quite successful.\" According<br />\nto Professor Morgan, it is the custom .of his publisher to keep irkstructive books in revision approximately every five years. \"All<br />\nof this,\" said Dr. Morgan, \"takes<br />\ntime; the revision must be begun<br />\nabout three years before it is to<br />\nappear on the market.\"<br />\nProfessor Morgan also plans to<br />\nwrite a number of other texts in<br />\npschology, but he has no definite<br />\nplans concerning them. \"Two revisions are enough to keep a man<br />\nbusy,\" he said. \"The process can<br />\ngo on and on, so long as the books<br />\nare successful. The physiological<br />\nand the new book looks as if it<br />\nalso will meet with success.\"<br />\n<br />\nConsulting Editor<br />\nIn addition to teaching and<br />\nwriting, Dr. Morgan is consulting<br />\neditor for the McGraw Hill<br />\npsychology series. This job means<br />\nthat he must read and consult<br />\nwith the publishers upon all prospective publications.<br />\nHis withdrawal from the University will be Dr. Morgan's permanent retirement from the teaching profession. He said that he<br />\nenjoys teaching, \"but I don't like<br />\nto make it a full time job. I also<br />\nenjoy writing, so I had to make<br />\na choice.\" He resigned as Chairman of the Psychology Department in June, 1954, n order to<br />\nhave more time to devote to his<br />\nforthcoming publication which<br />\nwas six years in preparation.<br />\nProfessor Morgan now lives in<br />\nCambridge, Maryland, or a shorefront farm he has owned for the<br />\npast two years. The farm was<br />\nbought in anticipation of his resignation, and he will do all of<br />\nhis future work there.

Each engineer, how-<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\never, is invaluable because this truly new high-performance airplane is only the<br />\nfinal result of the creative thought and teamwork of a large number of engineers.<br />\nThe individual ideas of each engineer are most<br />\nimportant. In aircraft design, the time lag between<br />\ndiscovery and the utilization of knowledge is<br />\nextremely short, shorter perhaps than in any other<br />\nmajor industry. The solutions to the most stimulating problems which arise in the industry are<br />\nfrequently dependent upon the daily utilization of<br />\nnew ideas and new knowledge.<br />\nThe graduating engineer considering his first<br />\ncareer decision may choose whether he will enter<br />\nthis field of work \u2014 the design of airplanes and<br />\nmissiles \u2014 that progresses hand in hand with new<br />\ndiscoveries in all facets of science and engineering,<br />\nor choose a less aggressive industry. Of course, it<br />\nfollows logically that greater and more rapid advancement opportunities lie in a field that does not<br />\nstagnate, in a field that is bounded by the creative<br />\nimagination of man alone. At Chance Vought, aircraft design draws capable engineers to positions<br />\nof greater responsibility in developing new ideas<br />\nand supervising the additional technical manpower<br />\nneeded to \"practicalize\" the ideas. Starting salaries are commensurate with education and experience for particular specialization and are also<br />\ncompetitive with other industries as well as<br />\nother companies. Advancement, as one would<br /><br />\nexpect, is based upon demonstrated performance,<br />\nnot seniority.<br />\nThe future of the aircraft industry is equal to, if<br />\nnot brighter than, that of other industries. The<br />\ncomplexity of modern aircraft and missiles, the<br />\ninvestigation of new fields of knowledge as aircraft fly higher and faster, the possibilities of<br />\nman's further use of science and engineering for<br />\nconquest of the air in the second half of the 20th<br />\ncentury, all emphasize the challenge and opportunity to the young graduate.<br />\nWe urge the graduating engineer to investigate<br />\nthese opportunities at Chance Vought. He will<br />\nfind a stable, 38-year-old aircraft designer and<br />\nbuilder with young ideas, a designer and builder<br />\nnoted for advancing the state-of-the-art of aircraft and guided missile design. He will discover<br />\nthat Chance Vought offers career opportunities,<br />\nnot merely impressive titles, and that he will<br />\njoin an engineering organization that thinks<br />\nand operates as a team rather than as a random<br />\ncollection of individual engineers.<br />\nWe have the usual fringe benefits including an excellent graduate study program, group insurance,<br />\nretirement income plan, paid vacation, sick leave,<br />\nmoving allowance, and numerous paid holidays.<br /><br />\nWe invite you to discuss your opportunities at Chance Vought with<br />\nW.

Tests are conducted on full-scale experimental engines at simulated altitudes up to<br />\n76,000 feet. Extremely high speed airflow, with<br />\npressure and temperature accurately controlled,<br />\nduplicates speeds as high as Mach 2.75. To reproduce such prodigious flight conditions, extraordinary equipment had to be devised.

Morgan,<br />\nmember of the Department of<br />\nPsychology, has announced that<br />\nhe will resign from the Hopkins<br />\nfaculty after the first term of<br />\nthe 1956-57 academic year in order to devote full time to his writings.<br />\nProfessor Morgan has been a<br />\nmember of the Hopkins faculty<br />\nsince 1943, and he was appointed<br />\nto his present professorship in<br />\n1948. At this time, no successor<br />\nhas been named by the University<br />\nadministration.<br />\nDr. Morgan said that the reason<br />\nfor his resignation is a \"rather<br />\nunique story, but simplified it<br />\namounts to the fact that I hold<br />\ntwo full time jobs; I can't do both,<br />\nso I must make a choice between<br />\nthem.\" The first, and more obvious<br />\nof his full time occupations is<br />\nteaching. Dr. Morgan spends his<br />\n\"spare\" tme writing and editing<br />\nin the field of psychology. His<br />\nfourth book, a text for introductory psychology instruction, will<br />\nbe published next month and will<br /><br />\nbe used by the Hopkns Introductory Psychology course next year.<br />\nTo Revise Books<br />\nDuring the next four years, Dr.<br />\nMorgan must also revise his<br />\nphysiological psychology text book<br />\nand begin work on the second<br />\nedition of his newest publication.<br />\nThe first printing of the book will<br />\nconsist of 50,000 copies.<br />\nBoth he and the publishers<br />\n(McGraw Hill) expect the text to<br />\nbe \"quite successful.\" According<br />\nto Professor Morgan, it is the custom .of his publisher to keep irkstructive books in revision approximately every five years. \"All<br />\nof this,\" said Dr. Morgan, \"takes<br />\ntime; the revision must be begun<br />\nabout three years before it is to<br />\nappear on the market.\"<br />\nProfessor Morgan also plans to<br />\nwrite a number of other texts in<br />\npschology, but he has no definite<br />\nplans concerning them. \"Two revisions are enough to keep a man<br />\nbusy,\" he said. \"The process can<br />\ngo on and on, so long as the books<br />\nare successful. The physiological<br />\nand the new book looks as if it<br />\nalso will meet with success.\"<br /><br />\nConsulting Editor<br />\nIn addition to teaching and<br />\nwriting, Dr. Morgan is consulting<br />\neditor for the McGraw Hill<br />\npsychology series. This job means<br />\nthat he must read and consult<br />\nwith the publishers upon all prospective publications.<br />\nHis withdrawal from the University will be Dr. Morgan's permanent retirement from the teaching profession. He said that he<br />\nenjoys teaching, \"but I don't like<br />\nto make it a full time job. I also<br />\nenjoy writing, so I had to make<br />\na choice.\" He resigned as Chairman of the Psychology Department in June, 1954, n order to<br />\nhave more time to devote to his<br />\nforthcoming publication which<br />\nwas six years in preparation.<br />\nProfessor Morgan now lives in<br />\nCambridge, Maryland, or a shorefront farm he has owned for the<br />\npast two years. The farm was<br />\nbought in anticipation of his resignation, and he will do all of<br />\nhis future work there. At the time<br />\nthe farm waS- purchased, Dr. Morgan was not sure that he would<br />\nresign from the faculty.<br /><br />\nUnder the sponsorship of ODK,<br />\nnational leadership fraternity,<br />\nMeetings of campus leaders, discontinued last year \"because of<br />\ntheir inability to work\", were renewed yesterday under a newly<br />\ndevised plan, according to ODK<br />\nPresident Herbert Belgrad.<br />\nYestereay's meeting comprised<br />\nthe leaders of the various student<br />\npublic relations groups on the<br />\ncampus.
