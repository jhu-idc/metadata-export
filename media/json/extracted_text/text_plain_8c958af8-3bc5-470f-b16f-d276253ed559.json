M. C. A. They are given<br />\nunder the auspices of the Association in Levering Hall, and are intended specially for the<br />\nstudents of the University. They are not sermons, but they must be on topics distinctively<br />\nreligious. The course has been in existence<br />\nsince 1890 and now presents quite a respectable list of eminent men. They are :<br />\n1890. Rev. Dr. John A. Broadus of Southern<br />\nBaptist Theological Seminary.<br />\n1891. President W. R. Harper of Chicago<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n1892. Rev. Dr. Richard R. Storrs of Brooklyn.<br />\n1893. Rev. Dr. William R. Huntington of<br />\nNew York.<br />\n1894. President David J. Hill of the University of Rochester.<br />\n1895. Professor William R. Ramsey of the<br />\nUniversity of Glasgow.<br />\n1896. Bishop J. H. Vincent of the M. E.<br />\nChurch.<br />\n1897. Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott of Brooklyn.<br />\nFrancis Landley Patton, D. D., LL. D., the<br />\nlecturer for this year, was born in Bermuda in<br />\n1843. He received his education in Canada,<br />\nwas actively engaged as a Presbyterian minister for sixteen years, and taught in the Pres-<br />\n<br />\nbyterian Theological Seminary at Chicago,<br />\nand later at Princeton. He was for three<br />\nyears editor of The Interior, a leading Presbyterian paper published at Chicago. He became President of the College of New JersgY,<br />\nnow Princeton University, in 1888, which<br />\noffice he now holds.<br />\n<br />\nGEOLOGICAL SPECIFIENS.<br />\n<br />\nThe Geological Department has just received a series of large specimens of massive<br />\nand crystallized albite, through the kindness<br />\nof Mr. W. Robinson Molinard of this city.<br />\nThese specimens were taken from a large mica<br />\nmine situated about one mile north of Amelia<br />\nCourthouse, Amelia County, Va., where they<br />\nwere found in a large geode during the working of the mine. They represent only a small<br />\npart of the mineral \"pocket\" which carried<br />\niron pyrites, mica, garnets, corundum, fluorite<br />\nand different varieties of feldspar.<br />\nThis particular \"pocket,\" in which the albite<br />\noccurred projecting into the cavity in well-individualized crystals, is only a local development in a large lens of feldspar approximately<br />\n125 inches long by 20 inches wide, which<br />\nitself is very much like the pegmatite dikes<br />\nthat are so well exposed about Baltimore, especially in the neighborhood of Orange<br />\nGrove.<br />\nThe different crystals of the specimens often<br />\nshow marked milky coloring or the iridescent<br />\nplay of colors, which increases the value of the<br />\nspecimens. The various crystals have not<br />\nbeen studied, but will no doubt serve as a subject of investigation for some member of the<br />\nGeological Department.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER was very much flattered<br />\na short time ago by a request from a girls'<br />\nschool for a copy of our paper as a model for<br />\none they are preparing to issue. Bless them,<br />\nwe wish them all the luck in the world, and<br />\nhope ere long to get some valuable points<br />\nfrom them !<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nz.: .<br />\n<br />\nNEWS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\nSENATE.<br />\n<br />\nThe Senate is busily preparing for forensic<br />\nbattle, under the skilled leadership of the Censor, who has gained his experience in actual<br />\ncontests in days gone by. A mock fight during<br />\nthe last assembly served to display the valor of our stoutest champions. Their brilliant conduct on the field of \"Liberty and<br />\nEquality\" found its reward in the promotion<br />\nto higher honors. The general has placed in<br />\ntheir hands the banner of the Senate, to be<br />\ncarried through the lines of the House in irresistible onslaught\u2014or else to be covered with<br />\nthe bodies of the defendants. Six Senators<br />\nare the champions-elect, viz: Senators Fisher<br />\n(leader), Stearns (secretary of war), Hubner,<br />\nUlman, Ballard and Dieffenbach. A ministry<br />\nof war is planning the campaign, and training<br />\nthe men. It consists of Senators Hodges<br />\n' (chief), Kennard (secretary) and Clarke. At<br />\nthe next meeting of the Senate Champions<br />\nFisher and Hubner will appear in a rotary<br />\nturret of points on the immigration question.<br />\nAs they are confident that the missiles of fourteen assailants cannot penetrate this structure,<br />\nthey will stay content with peeping at the<br />\nenemy through the loopholes.<br />\nHOUSE.<br />\n<br />\nThe House of Representatives met Wednesday, February 2. Mr. Censor made a few important announcements pertaining to the joint<br />\ndebate. In brief, he said that the question<br />\nselected for the joint debate, \"Resolved, That<br />\nfurther immigration to the United States<br />\nshould be restricted,\" would be debated for<br />\nthree consecutive meetings in the House ;<br />\nthat two of the six selected debaters would<br />\npresent points for the affirmative side, while<br />\nthe House would argue against these and present additional points. The board of advisers<br />\nwill record points brought forward by the<br />\nHouse.<br />\nAt. the next session Speaker French and<br />\nCongressman Fisher will present points on<br />\nthe affirmative, and one-third of the House<br />\n<br />\nwill argue against them. This method, as it<br />\nwill be very general and searching, is practically for the purpose of getting the attitude of<br />\nthe class as a whole toward the question.<br />\nThe regular debate was : \"Resolved, That<br />\nall men are free and equal.\" The affirmative<br />\nside was presented by Congressmen Knapp,<br />\nBruce and Raymond; the negative by Congressmen Kurrelmeyer, Wright and RobinThe debate was quite lacking in dash<br />\nand spirit. The preparation that the debaters<br />\ngave the question was far too little for them<br />\nto arrive at any clear and definite idea of the<br />\nsubject matter. This confusion of ideas was<br />\nalso quite apparent in the open discussion.<br />\nThe negative side won the debate through a<br />\nlittle better presentation, though no superiority of arguments.<br />\nThe debaters from the class of '99 and the<br />\nadvisers have taken active steps in preparation<br />\nfor the joint debate. They are holding frequent meetings, in which they discuss the<br />\nquestion and criticise each other's style of<br />\ndelivery.<br />\nThe class of '99 met Wednesday, February<br />\n2. The class history was read and a few important points discussed.<br />\n<br />\nTHE STUDENT VOLUNTEER CONVENTION.<br />\n<br />\nA notable event in inter-collegiate affairs<br />\nfor this month will be the Student Volunteer<br />\nConvention, which will be held at Cleveland,<br />\nOhio, beginning February 23. These conventions are held once in a generation of students and are attended by delegates from all<br />\nthe colleges and universities of the country.<br />\nUnusual interest is being shown this year, and<br />\nthe convention will be the largest ever held.<br />\nFour hundred institutions will be represented<br />\nby between 1,5oo and 2,000 students. Mr. F.S.<br />\nBrockman, Traveling Secretary of the Student Volunteer Movement, addressed the Y.<br />\nM. C. A. at its last meeting and urged that<br />\nHopkins be well represented.

The \"new era in our athletics,\"<br />\nso much talked of and prophesied, could not<br />\nbe better inaugurated than by making this occasion a great success. It is especially desirable that the men from the Medical School,<br />\nwhose connection with the rest of the University is figuratively as well as literally \"remote,\"<br />\nshould be well represented ; and to them in<br />\nparticular a most cordial invitation is extended.<br />\n<br />\nAt last!

The elevator boy's eyes<br />\nshone, and the postman waxed reminiscent.<br />\nThe whole University seemed on the eye of<br />\ndoing something, and the Dean<br />\nIt was a noble fight, a royal scrap, a\u2014but<br />\nwords fail us. We all know just what it was,<br />\nand we all enjoyed it. What could have been<br />\nmore deliriously exhilarating than to watch<br />\nthat squirming mass of arms and legs? What<br />\nmatters it if a few cheeks or shirts were torn,<br />\na few hats or ribs stove in, a few buttons or<br />\ntemper lost ? Think first of the pleasures it<br />\ngave; of the bookworn student who had not<br />\nhad a hearty laugh since Christmas \u2014 then<br />\nstrike the balance.<br />\nWe must confess that we thought the old<br />\npot social something of a failure. There was<br />\nthe same wild abandon, the same noble heroism, the same melodramatic effect. But who<br />\nsaw it? Only a few lucky seniors, pinned<br />\nclose against the walls of a stuffy locker-room.<br />\nIt was a purely selfish institution, born to crush<br />\nunseen and waste its rudeness on the dusty air.<br />\nIts sphere was too limited. It lacked a raison<br />\nd'art'. It gave pleasure to no one\u2014except,<br />\nperhaps, the tailor.<br />\nBut it's different now. We have an amphitheatre big enough for a bull-fight. There is<br />\nroom for all the University, and half the town<br />\nbesides. Send the faculty a special invitation<br />\nand let the ladies have reserved seats. Then<br />\ncharge an admission fee for all the rest, and the<br />\ncoffers of the Athletic Association will overflow.<br />\nIt would be by far the most popular show in<br />\ntown. And why? Is it because we are barbarous enough to hunger for the sight of<br />\nblood. Not at all. We would not have a single man hurt. We only feel more intensely<br />\nthat same sense of delight which the immortal<br />\nPuck must have experienced that midsummer<br />\nnight when he exclaimed : \"Lord ! What<br />\nfools these mortals be !\"<br />\n<br />\nCertain writers of late have given considerable attention to the subject of city noises and<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nNEWS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\n<br />\ntheir effect upon mortality. We are assured<br />\nthat some sweet day all doors will slam to a<br />\nset tune, and rumbling drays will sing a lullaby. However that may be, it occurs to us<br />\nthat an investigation of the effect of noises<br />\nupon mentality at this University might prove<br />\ninteresting. We have the finest general assortment of noises to be found anywhere in the<br />\ncity. Our own little Ross street enjoys an<br />\nenviable reputation for its storminess and consequent popularity among all the drivers in<br />\ntown. Car-gongs, mingled with street cries<br />\ngalore, show no respect for Greek syntax or<br />\neconomics? But, in addition to all these, we<br />\ntake pleasure in announcing that a new noise<br />\nis in our midst. One of our neighbors to the<br />\nwest has stocked his back yard with a lusty<br />\nflock of geese, and these sacred birds can reproduce at any time of the day all the \"atmosphere\" or \"local coloring\" the classical students can desire, who wishes to bring back the<br />\ntime when Rome was so miraculously preserved.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER here solemnly promises<br />\nthat it will devote its first earnings to the<br />\npurchase and exportation of those geese, and<br />\nthen, if anything is left, it may think about cementing Ross street.<br />\nWHAT?

RILEY'S SUCCESS.<br />\n<br />\nAmong the recent Hopkins graduates who<br />\nhave already achieved distinction is Dr. F. L.<br />\nRiley, professor of history at the University of<br />\nMississippi. Since taking his degree here in<br />\n1896, Dr. Riley has been very energetic in his<br />\nefforts to promote the study of history in Mississippi, atld has endeavored, by addresses and<br />\nby articles in the newspapers and magazines,<br />\nto increase the interest of the public at large in<br />\nthe subject. He served as secretary of the recent State Historical Association and took a<br />\nvery prominent part in the proceedings of that<br />\nbody. Dr. Riley is now trying to secure financial assistance from the State to publish the<br />\npapers, etc., of the Association.<br />\nAbout thirty of the graduate students in<br />\nchemistry enjoyed a trip to the Maryland<br />\nSteel Works at Sparrows' Point on Friday,<br />\nJanuary 28. Dr. Charles L. Reese took the<br />\nboys down, and, with the assistance of Mr.<br />\nReese, his brother, who is superintendent of<br />\nthe works, explained the workings of the big<br />\nmachinery.<br />\nAll the fellows enjoyed the trip immensely<br />\nand both Dr. Reese and Mr. Reese have the<br />\nwarmest thanks of those who were fortunate<br />\nenough to be able to accept their kindness.<br />\nATHLETIC REGULATIONS.<br />\n<br />\nHer hand was holding<br />\nwhat?<br />\nYes, what?<br />\nNow mine held fast to hers.<br />\nThen her lips sweet touched<br />\nwhat?<br />\nYes, what?<br />\nFor mine, I'm sure, touched hers.<br />\n8:1<br />\n<br />\nit 9<br />\n<br />\nMr. M.--.-The book which I am going to review is divided into chapters (happy afterthought), as books commonly are.<br />\n<br />\nThe Universities of Indian Territory, Arizona, Honolulu and Sacarappa have adopted<br />\nthe following regulations :<br />\nWe can run ourselves without these little<br />\ncolleges and high schools like Harvard and<br />\nYale interfering.<br />\nNo man shall play on the same team with<br />\nhis grandson.<br />\nChildren under five shall not be eligible for<br />\ncollege football teams.<br />\nGames in which we are licked shall be called<br />\npractice games.<br />\nSummer ice-polo shall be discouraged.<br />\nRough football shall be stopped by ruling<br />\nout any player who touches another.<br />\n\u2014Hansard Lampoon.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nOPENING OF THE CAGE.<br />\n<br />\nA large body of students, professors and<br />\nalumni listened to the speeches at the official<br />\nopening of the new gymnasium and cage.<br />\nPresident Gilman, Mr. Morton Stewart, Dr.<br />\nRenouf, the Dean, Dr. Read, Mr. Morrison,<br />\nMr. Maddren and Mr. Scholl ('98) all spoke<br />\non subjects pertaining to some feature of<br />\nphysical development. The most noteworthy<br />\nspeeches were beyond a doubt those of Dr.<br />\nRenouf, the director of the gymnasium, and<br />\nMr. Morrison, the well-known lawyer and<br />\nHopkins alumnus. They dwelt on the past<br />\nhistory of Hopkins athletics, and of gymnasium work in particular. It is well known<br />\namong all the students that fraternity rivalry<br />\nmade the gymnasium unfashionable and<br />\nruined our teams. Compulsory gymnasium<br />\nwork will create a broader college spirit<br />\nthrough bringing all the students in closer<br />\ncommunication.<br />\nThis first step towards<br />\nbreaking,up our clanishness will also be the<br />\ndawn of a new and more prosperous era for<br />\nour athletics. Dr. Read gave an interesting<br />\ntalk on mountain climbing, in which he called<br />\nattention to the fact that most of the noted<br />\nmountaineers are or have been university<br />\nmen. Mr. Maddren spoke in the interest of<br />\nthe lacrosse team, pleading for strict obedience to the captain.<br />\n<br />\nCINDER TRACK NEEDED.<br />\n<br />\nIt is quite necessary that a cinder track<br />\nshould be put in the cage. The candidates<br />\nfor the track team cannot be properly trained<br />\nwithout it.<br />\nThis track (as was stated by someone who<br />\nhas experience in such matters) can be completed inside of seven days. It will not interfere with baseball or lacrosse, as it will be but<br />\nfive feet broad ; on the other hand, it will afford opportunity for members of the above<br />\nmentioned teams to exercise their leg muscles<br />\nand get some wind.<br />\n<br />\nHOCKEY.<br />\n<br />\nThe hockey team was defeated Tuesday of<br />\nlast week by the University of Maryland. This<br />\ndefeat puts Hopkins in third place, and makes<br />\nher chances for winning the championship<br />\nrather slim. The game was rough, several<br />\nmen on both sides receiving bad cuts. Hopkins showed a decided lack of team work and<br />\nput up a slow game. The final score was :<br />\nUniversity of Maryland 2, Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity o.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows :<br />\nPosition.<br />\nU. of M.<br />\nJ. H.

Tuesday and Thursdays are the days<br />\nappointed for seniors and juniors.<br />\nThe class of '98, at a meeting held last Friday, decided to immortalize itself by placing<br />\nandirons in the fire-place of the smokingroom and a class shield on the wall. Messrs.<br />\nFowler, V. E. Smith and Ulman were appointed a committee, with full power to make the<br />\nselections and assess the class the amount necessary for the purchases. Messrs. Ballard,<br />\nHarwood and Hodges were elected to the<br />\nHouse Committee of the gymnasium.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE GArIE OF GOLF.<br />\n<br />\nThe game of golf differs in so many essential<br />\ncharacteristics from other outdoor games that<br />\nat first sight it does not recommend itself to<br />\nthe inter-collegiate athlete. In the first place,<br />\nunless a spectator has some personal interest<br />\nin a match, or is himself an enthusiast, golf is a<br />\nvery slow game to watch. This would not suit<br />\nthe average college \"rooter.\" Again, the<br />\nrules absolutely forbid any noise\u2014that is, talking, etc., during a stroke. College yells, which<br />\nhave become a part and parcel of inter-collegiate games, would, therefore, have to be<br />\nabandoned. Further, golf differs from most<br />\ngames in the fact that there is no personal contact, and consequently no man-to-man rivalry.<br />\nThis would do away with the rigorous training<br />\nnow so generally in vogue, as physical<br />\nstrength per se is of no particular advantage,<br />\nbut skill is the important factor. Many a time<br />\nhave I seen some stalwart footballer, or cricketer, downed on the links by a man perhaps old<br />\nenough to be his father, or, again, by some slip<br />\nof a boy, simply because of the same skill.<br />\nIt is often asked: \"What is the attraction<br />\nabout golf ?<br />\nVolumes could be written on<br />\nthis subject. Perhaps our answer might be,<br />\nthe fascination of hidden difficulties, the apparent ease with which a skillful player swings<br />\nhis club and the real difficulty of attaining that<br />\nsame skill. The infinite variety, for in no two<br />\nrounds of the links is a player confronted with<br />\nthe same difficulties, might also be mentioned.<br />\nBut the real attraction, to my mind, is that it<br />\ntakes an honest gentleman to really play and<br />\nappreciate the game. And herein lies the chief<br />\ndifference between this and other games. We<br />\nAmericans are so bound down by rules and<br />\numpires and reform, etc., that generosity to an<br />\nopponent and sport for sport's sake hardly get<br />\na chance. In a match at golf each man is his<br />\nown umpire, and if any cheating and sly shifting of the \"lie\" of the ball, any miscounts,<br />\ncreep into the golfer's record, all interest in<br />\nthe game is at once lost.<br />\nTherefore, I think that inter-collegiate golf<br />\nis a most excellent thing, and deserves the attention of all true sportsmen, inasmuch as it<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nmay serve to eradicate the spirit of \"win by<br />\nhook or by crook\" which so pervades our<br />\nAmerican sports.<br />\nA.J. H. U. GOLFER.<br />\n<br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\n<br />\nThe Minnesota Magazine for January contains a well-written article on the Johns Hopkins University. It is written from a liberal<br />\nstandpoint, and gives the Hopkins full credit<br />\nfor the many excellent points so well known<br />\nto all her sons.<br />\nA well-deserved tribute is paid to President<br />\nGilman for his ability and good judgment,<br />\nwhich have been so powerful in making our<br />\nUniversity what it is\u2014the first in America.<br />\nThe author gives a brief account of the<br />\nfoundation of the University, and then proceeds to a statement of the broad and liberal<br />\npolicy which has always characterized the<br />\nmanagement of the Hopkins.<br />\nAltogether, the article is one most satisfactory to Hopkins men. All the advantages and<br />\ngood points are brought out in a manner<br />\nhighly satisfactory.<br />\nOne great fault is mentioned, and that is<br />\none we all feel. It is the lack of college spirit<br />\nin the University. How long shall Hopkins<br />\nmen allow this one fault to mar every account<br />\nof the University? Men, we can remove the<br />\none great blot if we will !

M. C. A. They are given<br />\nunder the auspices of the Association in Levering Hall, and are intended specially for the<br />\nstudents of the University. They are not sermons, but they must be on topics distinctively<br />\nreligious. The course has been in existence<br />\nsince 1890 and now presents quite a respectable list of eminent men. They are :<br />\n1890. Rev. Dr. John A. Broadus of Southern<br />\nBaptist Theological Seminary.<br />\n1891. President W. R. Harper of Chicago<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n1892. Rev. Dr. Richard R. Storrs of Brooklyn.<br />\n1893. Rev. Dr. William R. Huntington of<br />\nNew York.<br />\n1894. President David J. Hill of the University of Rochester.<br />\n1895. Professor William R. Ramsey of the<br />\nUniversity of Glasgow.<br />\n1896. Bishop J. H. Vincent of the M. E.<br />\nChurch.<br />\n1897. Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott of Brooklyn.<br />\nFrancis Landley Patton, D. D., LL. D., the<br />\nlecturer for this year, was born in Bermuda in<br />\n1843. He received his education in Canada,<br />\nwas actively engaged as a Presbyterian minister for sixteen years, and taught in the Pres-<br /><br />\nbyterian Theological Seminary at Chicago,<br />\nand later at Princeton. He was for three<br />\nyears editor of The Interior, a leading Presbyterian paper published at Chicago. He became President of the College of New JersgY,<br />\nnow Princeton University, in 1888, which<br />\noffice he now holds.<br /><br />\nGEOLOGICAL SPECIFIENS.<br /><br />\nThe Geological Department has just received a series of large specimens of massive<br />\nand crystallized albite, through the kindness<br />\nof Mr. W. Robinson Molinard of this city.<br />\nThese specimens were taken from a large mica<br />\nmine situated about one mile north of Amelia<br />\nCourthouse, Amelia County, Va., where they<br />\nwere found in a large geode during the working of the mine. They represent only a small<br />\npart of the mineral \"pocket\" which carried<br />\niron pyrites, mica, garnets, corundum, fluorite<br />\nand different varieties of feldspar.<br />\nThis particular \"pocket,\" in which the albite<br />\noccurred projecting into the cavity in well-individualized crystals, is only a local development in a large lens of feldspar approximately<br />\n125 inches long by 20 inches wide, which<br />\nitself is very much like the pegmatite dikes<br />\nthat are so well exposed about Baltimore, especially in the neighborhood of Orange<br />\nGrove.<br />\nThe different crystals of the specimens often<br />\nshow marked milky coloring or the iridescent<br />\nplay of colors, which increases the value of the<br />\nspecimens. The various crystals have not<br />\nbeen studied, but will no doubt serve as a subject of investigation for some member of the<br />\nGeological Department.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER was very much flattered<br />\na short time ago by a request from a girls'<br />\nschool for a copy of our paper as a model for<br />\none they are preparing to issue. Bless them,<br />\nwe wish them all the luck in the world, and<br />\nhope ere long to get some valuable points<br />\nfrom them !<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nz.: .<br /><br />\nNEWS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br />\nSENATE.<br /><br />\nThe Senate is busily preparing for forensic<br />\nbattle, under the skilled leadership of the Censor, who has gained his experience in actual<br />\ncontests in days gone by. A mock fight during<br />\nthe last assembly served to display the valor of our stoutest champions. Their brilliant conduct on the field of \"Liberty and<br />\nEquality\" found its reward in the promotion<br />\nto higher honors. The general has placed in<br />\ntheir hands the banner of the Senate, to be<br />\ncarried through the lines of the House in irresistible onslaught\u2014or else to be covered with<br />\nthe bodies of the defendants. Six Senators<br />\nare the champions-elect, viz: Senators Fisher<br />\n(leader), Stearns (secretary of war), Hubner,<br />\nUlman, Ballard and Dieffenbach. A ministry<br />\nof war is planning the campaign, and training<br />\nthe men. It consists of Senators Hodges<br />\n' (chief), Kennard (secretary) and Clarke. At<br />\nthe next meeting of the Senate Champions<br />\nFisher and Hubner will appear in a rotary<br />\nturret of points on the immigration question.<br />\nAs they are confident that the missiles of fourteen assailants cannot penetrate this structure,<br />\nthey will stay content with peeping at the<br />\nenemy through the loopholes.<br />\nHOUSE.<br /><br />\nThe House of Representatives met Wednesday, February 2. Mr. Censor made a few important announcements pertaining to the joint<br />\ndebate. In brief, he said that the question<br />\nselected for the joint debate, \"Resolved, That<br />\nfurther immigration to the United States<br />\nshould be restricted,\" would be debated for<br />\nthree consecutive meetings in the House ;<br />\nthat two of the six selected debaters would<br />\npresent points for the affirmative side, while<br />\nthe House would argue against these and present additional points. The board of advisers<br />\nwill record points brought forward by the<br />\nHouse.<br />\nAt. the next session Speaker French and<br />\nCongressman Fisher will present points on<br />\nthe affirmative, and one-third of the House<br /><br />\nwill argue against them. This method, as it<br />\nwill be very general and searching, is practically for the purpose of getting the attitude of<br />\nthe class as a whole toward the question.<br />\nThe regular debate was : \"Resolved, That<br />\nall men are free and equal.\" The affirmative<br />\nside was presented by Congressmen Knapp,<br />\nBruce and Raymond; the negative by Congressmen Kurrelmeyer, Wright and RobinThe debate was quite lacking in dash<br />\nand spirit. The preparation that the debaters<br />\ngave the question was far too little for them<br />\nto arrive at any clear and definite idea of the<br />\nsubject matter. This confusion of ideas was<br />\nalso quite apparent in the open discussion.<br />\nThe negative side won the debate through a<br />\nlittle better presentation, though no superiority of arguments.<br />\nThe debaters from the class of '99 and the<br />\nadvisers have taken active steps in preparation<br />\nfor the joint debate. They are holding frequent meetings, in which they discuss the<br />\nquestion and criticise each other's style of<br />\ndelivery.<br />\nThe class of '99 met Wednesday, February<br />\n2. The class history was read and a few important points discussed.<br /><br />\nTHE STUDENT VOLUNTEER CONVENTION.<br /><br />\nA notable event in inter-collegiate affairs<br />\nfor this month will be the Student Volunteer<br />\nConvention, which will be held at Cleveland,<br />\nOhio, beginning February 23. These conventions are held once in a generation of students and are attended by delegates from all<br />\nthe colleges and universities of the country.<br />\nUnusual interest is being shown this year, and<br />\nthe convention will be the largest ever held.<br />\nFour hundred institutions will be represented<br />\nby between 1,5oo and 2,000 students. Mr. F.S.<br />\nBrockman, Traveling Secretary of the Student Volunteer Movement, addressed the Y.<br />\nM. C. A. at its last meeting and urged that<br />\nHopkins be well represented.

The \"new era in our athletics,\"<br />\nso much talked of and prophesied, could not<br />\nbe better inaugurated than by making this occasion a great success. It is especially desirable that the men from the Medical School,<br />\nwhose connection with the rest of the University is figuratively as well as literally \"remote,\"<br />\nshould be well represented ; and to them in<br />\nparticular a most cordial invitation is extended.<br /><br />\nAt last! Despite his anxious fears, the senior<br />\nhas been rewarded. The hard-fought battles<br />\nof his freshman and junior years have not been<br />\nin vain ! He has seen his desire upon his<br />\nenemy<br />\nHow he did enjoy it, with mouth and eyes<br /><br />\nall open 1 And even the imperturbable grad.<br />\nwas seen to smile a faint smile before turning<br />\nto his book again. The elevator boy's eyes<br />\nshone, and the postman waxed reminiscent.<br />\nThe whole University seemed on the eye of<br />\ndoing something, and the Dean<br />\nIt was a noble fight, a royal scrap, a\u2014but<br />\nwords fail us. We all know just what it was,<br />\nand we all enjoyed it. What could have been<br />\nmore deliriously exhilarating than to watch<br />\nthat squirming mass of arms and legs? What<br />\nmatters it if a few cheeks or shirts were torn,<br />\na few hats or ribs stove in, a few buttons or<br />\ntemper lost ? Think first of the pleasures it<br />\ngave; of the bookworn student who had not<br />\nhad a hearty laugh since Christmas \u2014 then<br />\nstrike the balance.<br />\nWe must confess that we thought the old<br />\npot social something of a failure. There was<br />\nthe same wild abandon, the same noble heroism, the same melodramatic effect. But who<br />\nsaw it? Only a few lucky seniors, pinned<br />\nclose against the walls of a stuffy locker-room.<br />\nIt was a purely selfish institution, born to crush<br />\nunseen and waste its rudeness on the dusty air.<br />\nIts sphere was too limited. It lacked a raison<br />\nd'art'. It gave pleasure to no one\u2014except,<br />\nperhaps, the tailor.<br />\nBut it's different now. We have an amphitheatre big enough for a bull-fight. There is<br />\nroom for all the University, and half the town<br />\nbesides. Send the faculty a special invitation<br />\nand let the ladies have reserved seats. Then<br />\ncharge an admission fee for all the rest, and the<br />\ncoffers of the Athletic Association will overflow.<br />\nIt would be by far the most popular show in<br />\ntown. And why? Is it because we are barbarous enough to hunger for the sight of<br />\nblood. Not at all. We would not have a single man hurt. We only feel more intensely<br />\nthat same sense of delight which the immortal<br />\nPuck must have experienced that midsummer<br />\nnight when he exclaimed : \"Lord ! What<br />\nfools these mortals be !\"<br /><br />\nCertain writers of late have given considerable attention to the subject of city noises and<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nNEWS OF A FORTNIGHT.<br /><br />\ntheir effect upon mortality. We are assured<br />\nthat some sweet day all doors will slam to a<br />\nset tune, and rumbling drays will sing a lullaby. However that may be, it occurs to us<br />\nthat an investigation of the effect of noises<br />\nupon mentality at this University might prove<br />\ninteresting. We have the finest general assortment of noises to be found anywhere in the<br />\ncity. Our own little Ross street enjoys an<br />\nenviable reputation for its storminess and consequent popularity among all the drivers in<br />\ntown. Car-gongs, mingled with street cries<br />\ngalore, show no respect for Greek syntax or<br />\neconomics? But, in addition to all these, we<br />\ntake pleasure in announcing that a new noise<br />\nis in our midst. One of our neighbors to the<br />\nwest has stocked his back yard with a lusty<br />\nflock of geese, and these sacred birds can reproduce at any time of the day all the \"atmosphere\" or \"local coloring\" the classical students can desire, who wishes to bring back the<br />\ntime when Rome was so miraculously preserved.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER here solemnly promises<br />\nthat it will devote its first earnings to the<br />\npurchase and exportation of those geese, and<br />\nthen, if anything is left, it may think about cementing Ross street.<br />\nWHAT? YES, WHAT?<br /><br />\nHer eye was fixed on<br />\nwhat?<br />\nYes, what?<br />\nBut mine was fixed on her.<br />\nShe sat right close to<br />\nwhat ?<br />\nYes, what?<br />\nI sat right close to her.<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 3.)<br />\nPROF.

The most noteworthy<br />\nspeeches were beyond a doubt those of Dr.<br />\nRenouf, the director of the gymnasium, and<br />\nMr. Morrison, the well-known lawyer and<br />\nHopkins alumnus. They dwelt on the past<br />\nhistory of Hopkins athletics, and of gymnasium work in particular. It is well known<br />\namong all the students that fraternity rivalry<br />\nmade the gymnasium unfashionable and<br />\nruined our teams. Compulsory gymnasium<br />\nwork will create a broader college spirit<br />\nthrough bringing all the students in closer<br />\ncommunication.<br />\nThis first step towards<br />\nbreaking,up our clanishness will also be the<br />\ndawn of a new and more prosperous era for<br />\nour athletics. Dr. Read gave an interesting<br />\ntalk on mountain climbing, in which he called<br />\nattention to the fact that most of the noted<br />\nmountaineers are or have been university<br />\nmen. Mr. Maddren spoke in the interest of<br />\nthe lacrosse team, pleading for strict obedience to the captain.<br /><br />\nCINDER TRACK NEEDED.<br /><br />\nIt is quite necessary that a cinder track<br />\nshould be put in the cage. The candidates<br />\nfor the track team cannot be properly trained<br />\nwithout it.<br />\nThis track (as was stated by someone who<br />\nhas experience in such matters) can be completed inside of seven days. It will not interfere with baseball or lacrosse, as it will be but<br />\nfive feet broad ; on the other hand, it will afford opportunity for members of the above<br />\nmentioned teams to exercise their leg muscles<br />\nand get some wind.<br /><br />\nHOCKEY.<br /><br />\nThe hockey team was defeated Tuesday of<br />\nlast week by the University of Maryland. This<br />\ndefeat puts Hopkins in third place, and makes<br />\nher chances for winning the championship<br />\nrather slim. The game was rough, several<br />\nmen on both sides receiving bad cuts. Hopkins showed a decided lack of team work and<br />\nput up a slow game. The final score was :<br />\nUniversity of Maryland 2, Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity o.<br />\nThe line-up was as follows :<br />\nPosition.<br />\nU. of M.<br />\nJ. H.

Tuesday and Thursdays are the days<br />\nappointed for seniors and juniors.<br />\nThe class of '98, at a meeting held last Friday, decided to immortalize itself by placing<br />\nandirons in the fire-place of the smokingroom and a class shield on the wall. Messrs.<br />\nFowler, V. E. Smith and Ulman were appointed a committee, with full power to make the<br />\nselections and assess the class the amount necessary for the purchases. Messrs. Ballard,<br />\nHarwood and Hodges were elected to the<br />\nHouse Committee of the gymnasium.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nTHE GArIE OF GOLF.<br /><br />\nThe game of golf differs in so many essential<br />\ncharacteristics from other outdoor games that<br />\nat first sight it does not recommend itself to<br />\nthe inter-collegiate athlete. In the first place,<br />\nunless a spectator has some personal interest<br />\nin a match, or is himself an enthusiast, golf is a<br />\nvery slow game to watch. This would not suit<br />\nthe average college \"rooter.\" Again, the<br />\nrules absolutely forbid any noise\u2014that is, talking, etc., during a stroke. College yells, which<br />\nhave become a part and parcel of inter-collegiate games, would, therefore, have to be<br />\nabandoned. Further, golf differs from most<br />\ngames in the fact that there is no personal contact, and consequently no man-to-man rivalry.<br />\nThis would do away with the rigorous training<br />\nnow so generally in vogue, as physical<br />\nstrength per se is of no particular advantage,<br />\nbut skill is the important factor. Many a time<br />\nhave I seen some stalwart footballer, or cricketer, downed on the links by a man perhaps old<br />\nenough to be his father, or, again, by some slip<br />\nof a boy, simply because of the same skill.<br />\nIt is often asked: \"What is the attraction<br />\nabout golf ?<br />\nVolumes could be written on<br />\nthis subject. Perhaps our answer might be,<br />\nthe fascination of hidden difficulties, the apparent ease with which a skillful player swings<br />\nhis club and the real difficulty of attaining that<br />\nsame skill. The infinite variety, for in no two<br />\nrounds of the links is a player confronted with<br />\nthe same difficulties, might also be mentioned.<br />\nBut the real attraction, to my mind, is that it<br />\ntakes an honest gentleman to really play and<br />\nappreciate the game. And herein lies the chief<br />\ndifference between this and other games. We<br />\nAmericans are so bound down by rules and<br />\numpires and reform, etc., that generosity to an<br />\nopponent and sport for sport's sake hardly get<br />\na chance. In a match at golf each man is his<br />\nown umpire, and if any cheating and sly shifting of the \"lie\" of the ball, any miscounts,<br />\ncreep into the golfer's record, all interest in<br />\nthe game is at once lost.<br />\nTherefore, I think that inter-collegiate golf<br />\nis a most excellent thing, and deserves the attention of all true sportsmen, inasmuch as it<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nmay serve to eradicate the spirit of \"win by<br />\nhook or by crook\" which so pervades our<br />\nAmerican sports.<br />\nA.J. H. U. GOLFER.<br /><br />\nEXCHANGES.<br /><br />\nThe Minnesota Magazine for January contains a well-written article on the Johns Hopkins University. It is written from a liberal<br />\nstandpoint, and gives the Hopkins full credit<br />\nfor the many excellent points so well known<br />\nto all her sons.<br />\nA well-deserved tribute is paid to President<br />\nGilman for his ability and good judgment,<br />\nwhich have been so powerful in making our<br />\nUniversity what it is\u2014the first in America.<br />\nThe author gives a brief account of the<br />\nfoundation of the University, and then proceeds to a statement of the broad and liberal<br />\npolicy which has always characterized the<br />\nmanagement of the Hopkins.<br />\nAltogether, the article is one most satisfactory to Hopkins men. All the advantages and<br />\ngood points are brought out in a manner<br />\nhighly satisfactory.<br />\nOne great fault is mentioned, and that is<br />\none we all feel. It is the lack of college spirit<br />\nin the University. How long shall Hopkins<br />\nmen allow this one fault to mar every account<br />\nof the University? Men, we can remove the<br />\none great blot if we will ! Shall we not do it?<br /><br />\nAUTUFIN SADNESS.<br /><br />\nDry as Pommery her eyes<br />\nWhen we parted;<br />\nHard her heart as lunch-room pies,<br />\nWhile mine smarted;<br />\nCold as bottles from the icebox !<br />\nMe she drove to drink and dicebox !!<br />\nNow her dusty dollars lie<br />\nIn the bank;<br />\nShe is lovely still, and I<br />\nAm a tank;<br />\nAnd her cash I might be spending!<br />\nIsn't this a sorry ending?<br />\n\u2014Montingside.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nUNIVERSITY CHAT.<br /><br />\nMessrs.
