Two<br />\nyears ago the undergraduate<br />\nbrotherhood requested that the<br />\nalumni organization take over<br />\nmanagement of the large house<br />\nwhich was in need of extensive<br />\nrepair. At that time the house<br />\nwas appraised at $0; $100,000<br />\nwould be required to restore it<br />\nto reasonable condition. The<br />\nalumni were reluctant to sell the<br />\nland without first finding<br />\nanother house, so when the<br />\nCalvert School approached<br />\nthem with the offer of a property<br />\ntrade, they<br />\nbegan<br />\nnegotiations.<br />\nThe transfer was made at the<br />\nend of last May.

According to President of the Board of Trustees<br />\nDecatur Miller, the Calvert<br />\nSchool had never planned to<br />\nrenovate the house, so the<br />\ndamage did not affect their<br />\nplans. However there were<br />\nneighborhood complaints<br />\nabout the noise that evening<br />\nand the vandalism received<br />\nlocal television coverage.<br />\nThe publicity was embarrassing for Gam alumni and<br />\ndamaged the fraternity's chance<br />\nof rezoning the new house in<br />\nthe Charles Village area to<br />\nallow more than eight persons<br />\nto live there.

In a candid<br />\ndisclosure, Muller asserted that, assuming a<br />\nworst-case scenario, he would be willing to<br />\ndivert funds from research, facilities, and<br />\nfaculty salaries to the financial aid program.<br />\nIt seems, therefore, that Muller is placing a<br />\nhigher priority on equality of education than<br />\non quality of education. While such a view<br />\nmay be unpopular among Hopkins' administrators and faculty, The News-Letter<br />\ncommends this attitude.<br />\nOver the last thirty yews, the heightened<br />\nawareness of the necessity of further education combined with America's general<br />\neconomic prosperity has made educational<br />\nequality achievable without incurring any expense to the quality of education. As a result,<br />\neconomic status has, in recent years, become<br />\nof negligible importance in gaining access to<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe conditions that originally fostered this<br />\negalitarian trend are rapidly disappearing.<br />\nFederal budget cuts are forcing universities<br />\nto make painful choices. If universities fail<br />\nto find revenue sources outside of government, the need to choose between maintaining academic integrity and retaining equality of' opportunity may become a reality.<br />\nChoosing the former at the expense of the<br />\nlatter may well be the predominant choice.<br />\nAt Hopkins, for instance, the strong political<br />\nclout of the faculty and the University's<br />\nresearch tradition will make any effort to<br />\n<br />\ndi\u2018eri general funds to financial aid, tedious,<br />\nif not unachievable.<br />\nThe News-Letter feels that such a development would be unfortunate. It would<br />\ndismantle the avowed purpose of financial<br />\naid: to provide quality education for quality students, not qualifying bank rolls.<br />\nWithout financial aid, enrollment in any of<br />\nthis nation's to universities would be an<br />\nunattainable dream for even the vast majority of middle class students. Curtailment or<br />\nelimination of financial aid will add to<br />\neducational, social and economic stratification in this country<br />\nBut moreover, attempts to cut back on<br />\nfinancial aid would be myopic. Johns<br />\nHopkins' reputation as a research university comes, ultimately, from the quality of its<br />\nresearchers who are, at the most basic level,<br />\nits graduate and undergraduate students. By<br />\nplacing high financial qualifications over<br />\nHopkins' traditionally high academic<br />\nqualifications, the University may find itself<br />\nin danger of tainting the latter. In the long<br />\nrun, this could hurt Hopkins' reputation<br />\nmore than the refusal of faculty members to<br />\nshare the burden of tough financial<br />\nconditions<br />\nDuring the next few years. major universities will. be searching for additional<br />\nrevenue, from industry and from alumnae,<br />\nin order to keep both high academic standards and maintain equal opportunity in<br />\nhigher &education.

Students rarely stray further than<br />\nthe Charles Village Pub when searching for<br />\nentertainment or relaxation. Students must<br />\nlearn that Baltimore does have more to offer. Even within walking distance there are<br />\nplaces, often ignored by students,. that can<br />\nfulfill their needs. One of these places is on<br />\n33rd street, only a few blocks away:<br />\nMemorial Stadium, home of' the Baltimore<br />\nOrioles.<br />\n, Many Hopkins students either come from<br />\nareas where they are too far away from major league ballparks to attend games regularly, or follow teams who by Labor Day are<br />\nalready trying 'out their minor league prospects. Very few teams consistently find<br />\nthemselves in the midst of a pennant race<br />\nevery autumn. Because the Orioles are one<br />\n<br />\nof these rare teams, local fans take it for<br />\ngranted that September is the time that keeping track of other games in the division is<br />\nalmost as important as warching the game<br />\nat hand. Being in Baltimore in September,<br />\ntherefore, offers a unique opportunity for<br />\nmany out of town students.<br />\nTen home games remain this season. With<br />\nBaltimore once again in the middle of a hot<br />\npennant race, each game promises to<br />\ngenerate tension and excitement.

It was with no<br />\ngreat sorrow that he packed his<br />\nbags and boarded the<br />\nGreyhound bus to Baltimore.<br />\nHe was now an experienced<br />\nHoppie and, as such, knew all<br />\nthe ins and outs of arriving in<br />\nCharm City. In fact, he had<br />\nplanned ahead.<br />\nLet it be known that<br />\nJonathan A. Sophomore had<br />\nsaved his summer dollars so<br />\nthat he would be able to afford<br />\nthe requisite registration supplies. These should not be confused with paper, pens, and textbooks (or trade paperbacks);<br />\nthey come under a different<br />\nbudget code. No, Jonathan had<br />\npurchased a flamethrower, submachine gun, swithchblade,<br />\nand, for the less traumatic problems, a can of mace. Jon was<br />\ngoing to get through the<br />\nregistrar, cashier, book center,<br />\nfinancial aid, library, housing,<br />\nstudent activities, and post office lines without feeling like he<br />\nwas about to upchuck. He<br />\nwould succeed at any cost.<br />\nAfter all, he was the presidentelect of the Bridge Club.<br />\nMaybe it was fate, or maybe<br />\nit was Jonathan's lousy luck, or<br />\nmaybe it was pixies' and elves'<br />\nmagic, but all of Jonathan's<br />\ntools were unnecessary. Over<br />\nthe summer, The Johns<br />\nHopkins University had<br />\nundergone a tremendous,<br />\nalmost traumatic, change. Not<br />\na physical change, but a mental one. A majority of Hopkins'<br />\nclerical workers had become<br />\nnice. But that's jumping ahead<br />\nof our story.<br />\nJonathan entered the Great<br />\nHall expecting to be thrown<br />\nfrom one line to another. He<br />\nhad dressed for the occasion.<br />\nHe was wearing a black wool<br />\ncape and a suit of mail (a<br />\nmetallic get-up that's sort of<br />\nlike pop-tops from beer cans)<br />\nunderneath. Concealed in the<br />\ncape was the can of mace and<br />\nthe submachine gun. No one<br />\nwas going to push this dude<br />\naround. When he asked a question, he expected an answer. If<br />\nhe didn't get one\u2014tough. After<br />\nhe obtained his personalized<br />\nregistration permit, he was sent<br />\nto the Financial Aid table.<br />\nBrandishing his submachine<br />\ngun\u201e he quickly approached<br />\nthe clerk.<br />\n'Hello, may I help you?'<br />\n'My loan check didn't come<br />\nyet.'<br />\n`No problem, we'll just credit<br />\nhalf of it now and when it gets<br />\nhere, you can pay us.'<br />\nJonathan put the gun back,<br />\na bit dismayed that he didn't<br />\nhave to use it. No one had said,<br />\n'I-don't-know-shut-the-hellup,' or even,`oh, that's a problem for Problems\u2014NEXT!'<br />\nInstead Jonathan found good<br />\nwill. He saw his summer savings becoming useless. He<br />\ncould have bought drugs on<br />\nthose hot July nights.<br />\nFortunately, Jonathan had<br />\n<br />\nsecured a space in University<br />\nHousing as well. He had heard<br />\nhorror stories about the Housing Office form prior tenants.<br />\nHe decided that it would be best<br />\nto bring his mace when he went<br />\nto complain about his lumpy<br />\nhis new<br />\nmattress and<br />\nunhousebroken pets, the<br />\nroaches. Holding the can of<br />\nmace, he entered the Wolman<br />\nHall Office.<br />\n'May I help you?'<br />\n'Yes, I want a new mattress<br />\nand an exterminator.'<br />\n'That will be fine. Apartment<br />\nnumber?'<br />\n'217.'<br />\n'OK, expect them later<br />\ntoday.'<br />\nWhen they actually arrived,<br />\nJonathan went into shock. He<br />\nalmost wet his pants. He<br />\nthought he had Hopkins all<br />\nfigured out. He was obviously<br />\nvery wrong. 'Why me,' he<br />\nlamented, 'I spent all my summer wages on firearms and<br />\nhave no cause to use them.'<br />\n`Aha,' he thought,T11 visit<br />\nSharon in the SAC office. She's<br />\ngot to give me some trouble<br />\nabout the Bridge Club. Then<br />\nI'll get to use my switchblade.<br />\nI want to be sure it's sharp.'<br />\n'Come in, boss,' said<br />\nSharon. 'I was hoping to talk to<br />\nyou.'<br />\n'Of course,' remarked<br />\nJonathan as he reached for his<br />\nblade. `If it's about the<br />\ndeficit...'<br />\n<br />\n`No, no, I took care of that.<br />\nIt was a small deficit, so I shaved my dogs and made their fur<br />\ninto coats which I sold at<br />\nBloomingdale's. You've got<br />\nplenty of money now.'<br />\nJonathan felt himself going<br />\nover the edge. He wanted to<br />\nscream or kill or maim, but all<br />\nhe could do was stare at<br />\nSharon.<br />\n`No, I wanted to see you<br />\nbecause I wanted to know if<br />\n<br />\nyou were interested in an<br />\navocado Rolodex. There's an<br />\nextra one floating around here<br />\nand I know the Bridge Club<br />\ncould use one. They're very<br />\nsmart, you know. Aren't office<br />\nsupplies wonderful?'<br />\n'That's it!' he screamed.<br />\nJonathan had lost it; he<br />\ncould no longer handle all of<br />\nthese un-assholes. They were so<br />\nnice, so efficient, so damned<br />\n<br />\nhelpful! 'Damn it!,' he<br />\nthought,1 have to use these<br />\nweapons sometime. I guess I'll<br />\njoin HOPSFA and if they<br />\nwon't switch from swordfighting, I'll transfer to<br />\nsomeplace where clerical<br />\nworkers are still ignorant and<br />\nrude. Either that, or I'll hang<br />\nout at The Gilman Post Office.<br />\nNothing will ever change there.'<br />\nSure enough, he was right.<br />\n<br />\nDraft Registration<br />\n<br />\nNot Even Worth Worrying About<br />\nBY DON GORDON<br />\nOnce again, two and a half<br />\nyears after its resumption, the<br />\ndraft registration issue has crept<br />\nback into the news. The Reagan<br />\nAdministration, in a theatrical<br />\nplay of`get-tough' law enforcement, has deemed it the appropriate time to begin prosecuting a handful of men who<br />\ncommitted the heinous felony<br />\nof not registering, even though<br />\nthere is no draft. The Feds are<br />\nwasting their time and your<br />\nmoney.<br />\nAlas, those in another<br />\nquarter are also wasting their<br />\ntime with the subject of<br />\nregistration, and they, at least,<br />\nshould know better. I refer to<br />\nthe leaders of progressive student politics nationwide, who<br />\nhave taken up the Sasway-Eller<br />\net al. convictions as their cross<br />\nin yet another crusade against<br />\nregistration.<br />\nSetting aside the untimeliness<br />\nof a protest against registration<br />\n(if not against prosecution of<br />\nnon-registrants), they are ignorant of political reality. In<br />\n<br />\ntheir intensity, they distract the<br />\nongoing debate from matters of<br />\nsubstance. The registration<br />\n'issue' preempts real social concerns, at a time when the potential for political action on a rich<br />\nagenda of issues is at a high<br />\npoint.<br />\nThese progressive students<br />\nhave neglected one crucial fact:<br />\nthere is no draft. No draft is<br />\nproposed by anyone in, or even<br />\nnear, the rightward-swinging<br />\npolitical mainstream in the U.S.<br />\nAs any political observer will<br />\ntell you, constitutional amendments to ban all abortions,<br />\nmandate school prayer, and<br />\nstrip the federal courts of their<br />\nindependence have seen to it<br />\nthat the draft has not even a<br />\nchance of being introduced, let<br />\nalone passed, by Congress.<br />\nBut this doesn't stop those<br />\nwho call themselves anti-draft<br />\n(they might as well be antislavery or anti-prohibition)<br />\nfrom railing at the program.<br />\nRegistration merely speeds up<br />\nby a tiny margin the time it<br />\ntakes to raise a conscripted<br />\nmilitary. It is, in itself, nothing.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe News-Letter encourages readers to write letters to<br />\nthe editor. However, we do request that all letters be<br />\ntyped, double-spaced. Please bring all letters to the<br />\nGatehouse by Wednesday at 5 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nWithout even the chance of a<br />\ndraft, registration is the flimsiest of paper tigers. And so it<br />\nis as a political issue.<br />\nIt is fine to oppose the draft<br />\non ideological grounds, but<br />\nwhy fight it when nobody's<br />\nfighting for the other side? In<br />\nan attempt to beat a little controversy out of a dead issue,<br />\nsome claim darkly that the<br />\ngovernment has abolished the<br />\nconscientious objector deferment. In fact, it has not. It just<br />\nhas not made it a part of the<br />\ndetermination of eligibility,<br />\nwhich happens only once a person is drafted. Hence, no draft,<br />\nno need for C.O. status.<br />\nLet's face it. Jimmy Carter<br />\nreached for the handiest saber<br />\nand rattled it at the Soviets for<br />\nmisbehaving in Afghanistan.<br />\nRegistration served because its<br />\nmeaninglessness made it<br />\npalatable to Congress\u2014nobody<br />\ngets drafted, no constituents<br />\ncomplain. (Even so, it passed<br />\nthe House by only a narrow<br />\n219-180 margin, proving my<br />\npoint about a reflexive<br />\nresistance in Congress to<br />\nanything smacking of conscription...even during those Redbaiting weeks in 1979.) Carter<br />\nbehaved like a Cold Warrior,<br />\nplaying electoral politics with<br />\nsensitive foreign policy all the<br />\nwhile. Though that sort of<br />\npolitical gamesmanship is inexcusable, it does not lend any<br />\nmore significance to this insignificant act.<br />\n<br />\nThe greatest irony of all is<br />\nthat those combating the<br />\nnonexistent threat of a draft<br />\nhave been known of late to invoke the sadly poor and<br />\nworking-class makeup of the<br />\ncurrent all-volunteer force\u2014as<br />\nan argument against the draft.<br />\nHere you may be tempted to do<br />\na double-take, but you read it<br />\nright. Phillip Schinandt, in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter claimed<br />\nthat, under the current arrangement and in these times of high<br />\nunemployment, 'more poor<br />\nand middle-class youth are finding that...the only way they<br />\ncan survive economically is by<br />\njoining the military.' This is<br />\ntrue, and it is a distressing<br />\nreflection on the increasing inequality and stratification in<br />\nour society. What puzzles me is<br />\nthat, against the theme of the<br />\nentire piece, this is the most<br />\ncompelling argument for the<br />\nrevival of the draft, albeit<br />\nwithout the cushy, elitist<br />\ndeferments(not meaning those<br />\nof conscience). It is even a better argument for a universal<br />\nprogram of national service.<br />\nThe latter is the only genuinely<br />\negalitarian solution to the problem of keeping an adequate<br />\nfighting force ready at all times.<br />\nThough I doubt it will ever happen, I think it is a good idea<br />\nand would support it. I doubt<br />\nSchmandt and other antiregistrants agree, but then what<br />\nsolutions do they propose?.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6/SEPTEMBER 17, 1982<br />\n<br />\nHard Times Bar<br />\n<br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS:<br />\n<br />\n28th & Huntington<br />\nClose to Campus<br />\nStudents Welcome<br />\nMon.

Well, add<br />\nanother endangered species to<br />\nthe Charles Village equivalent<br />\nof James Watt's hit list:<br />\nautomobiles.<br />\nI find it ironic that even<br />\nbefore the September 10, 1982<br />\nissue of The News Letter hit the<br />\nstreet with its coverage of two<br />\naccidents involving pedestrians,<br />\nI myself was involved in an<br />\n'altercation' involving another<br />\ncar at Charles and 33rd streets.<br />\nAnyone who has ever attempted to cross Charles Street<br />\non foot knows of the dangers<br />\ninvolved. You literally take<br />\nyour life in your hands. Even if<br />\nthe pedestrian 'walk' sign is lit<br />\nwhite, the odds are good that if<br />\nyou don't look both ways,<br />\nyou'll be hit by a stray piece of<br />\nnorth- or southbound traffic<br />\n(northbound is the better bet,<br />\nthough). The 'walk' sign and<br />\nthe almost continuously green<br />\nturn signal for traffic headed<br />\nnorth on Charles just don't<br />\njive, adding to a constantly<br />\ndangerous situation for<br />\npedestrians, especially students<br />\nwho have to make the trip at<br />\nleast twice daily.<br />\nGive a person a car to drive<br />\nin Charles Village, and he's not<br />\nmuch safer. Instead of hearing<br />\nthe thud of metal hitting flesh,<br />\nit's the crash and scrape of<br />\nmetal on metal, the cracking of<br />\nheadlights, the shatter of windshields. The intersection at<br />\nCharles and 33rd definitely<br />\nfavors the automobile, but\u2014<br />\nand this is an important but\u2014<br />\nit doesn't consider the driver.<br />\nTake me, for instance. I've<br />\nbeen walking and driving in this<br />\narea for the past three years. I<br />\nknow where the problem situations are. Problems have arisen<br />\nmany times when I've been in<br />\nthe right lane of 33rd Street,<br />\nready to cross Charles. A car<br />\ncuts across from the left lane to<br />\nturn onto the service lane of<br />\nCharles Street, which runs<br />\ndirectly along the University,<br />\ninstead of following the lines to<br />\nthe lane into which he should be<br />\ngoing. In other words, you have<br />\nboth the right and left lanes of<br />\n33rd Street making left-hand<br />\nturns down Charles; one into<br />\nthe lane protected by a median,<br />\nthe other headed unprotected<br />\ntoward three lanes of northbound traffic.

It completes one turn<br />\naround its axis every 12 hours,<br />\nand it requires 84 years to<br />\nrevolve around the sun.<br />\n<br />\nevidence of an aurora existing<br />\non Uranus, there can be other<br />\nexplanations for the greater<br />\nthan normal hydrogen emissions.

Before the<br />\nconstruction of Interstate 95 in 1963,<br />\nRoute One was the primary road<br />\nthrough Maryland. Shops once sprang<br />\nup along the road , drawing upon the<br />\nintercity traveler for his business. In<br />\nMaryland, cities such as Baltimore totally engulf the route, but in smaller towns,<br />\nRoute One still comprises a commercial<br />\ncore.<br />\nAs you cross the Mason-Dixon line,<br />\nRoute One changes from a divided<br />\nhighway in Pennsylvania to a two lane<br />\ncountry road in Cecil County,<br />\nMaryland. A few miles north of Rising<br />\nSun, Maryland corn fields cover the rolling hills. Sprawling farms and<br />\n\u2018Noodlands vastly overwhelm the occasional house a driver passes along the<br />\nroadside. At one time most of these<br />\nfarms were owned by private families<br />\nwho grew a variety of crops. Typically,<br />\neach family owned twelve to fifteen<br />\ncows. But today, because of the expense<br />\nof modern machinery, most of these<br />\nfarms have been taken over by cooperatives or corporations.<br />\nThe hamlet of Rising Sun is demarcated by small houses lining the left side<br />\nof the road. Most of these homes were<br />\nconstructed in the 1960's. Vast farms<br />\nstill stretch out behind them.<br />\nJust south of Rising Sun, on Conowingo Road stands the Spready Oak<br />\nSnack Bar, which takes its name from<br />\na large oak tree nearby. The Snack Bar<br />\nhas been a respite for weary travelers for<br />\n27 years. \"Those were the days,\" says<br />\nMr. Johnson, the Snack Bar's owner.<br />\n\"At that time the whole place was the<br />\nsize of the kitchen. McDonald's ? There<br />\nwere very few around. Those were the<br />\ndays of frozen custard. Root beer outsold Coke five to one. We still get a lot<br />\nof vacationers along this route. It hasn't<br />\nchanged that much.\"<br />\nMr. Johnson remembers that when he<br />\nlived along Route One as a child during<br />\nthe Depression, people would travel up<br />\nand down the road, carrying carts with<br />\ntheir belongings, searching for whatever<br />\nwork they could find. But Mr. Johnson,<br />\nthough he still loves the area, is concerned about possible changes, such as the<br />\ninflux of heavy industry.<br />\nThe Conowingo Dam marks the first<br />\nmajor topographical change along<br />\nRoute One. The dam blocks the Sus-<br />\n<br />\nquehanna river ten miles north of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay. The dam serves as<br />\nRoute One's bridge across the Susquehanna River. Howe\u2018er, this year the<br />\nbridge is under repair and travelers must<br />\nfollow a detour onto Interstate 1-95.<br />\nThis has caused heavy financial losses<br />\nfor the businesses along this section of<br />\nRoute One. The repercussions of the<br />\nrepair are felt on both sides of the river,<br />\nfrom Rising Sun to Bel Air. The Conowingo Diner, for instance, has lost 35<br />\npercent of its business due to the<br />\nconstruction.<br />\nBuddy has owned the diner for six<br />\nyears.. \"People used to come across the<br />\nbridge and come here to eat. We have<br />\nregular customers on the other side of<br />\nthe river, but they don't come here<br />\nbecause of the repairs,\" says Buddy, adding that other businesses, such as the<br />\nKwik Stop Snack Bar, have lost even<br />\nmore business than the diner.<br />\nBefore the bridge was closed, the<br />\n24-hour diner served mostly breakfasts<br />\nand dinners. \"We also got a lot of latenight weekend drinkers,\" Buddy brags.<br />\n\"You know, high school students who'd<br />\ncome here after drinking.\"Now most of<br />\nthe patrons are the workmen and those<br />\nwho live on the north side of the river.<br />\nIn about a year, when work is completed, Buddy expects to be serving<br />\nmore truckers, who have been<br />\ndiscouraged from using the road since<br />\nrepairs began in 1980.<br />\nAcross the dam, in Harford County,<br />\nthe road is less rural. Houses appear<br />\nmore frequently; farms are smaller.<br />\nNearby is the town of Bel Air, the<br />\nlargest Route One town north of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nJust outside of Bel Air is the Hickory<br />\nInn Motel. Connie Brieger is the<br />\nmanager of the motel and adjacent<br />\nrestaurant. The business has been owned by her family since it was founded in<br />\nthe 1950's as Browne's Log Cabin Coffee Shop. Beginning in the 1960's, the<br />\n<br />\nmotel business catered almost exclusively to workers at the newly contructed<br />\nPeach Bottom nuclear reactor.The reactor business offset the declining number<br />\nof travelers using Route One following<br />\nthe opening of 1-95. \"Travel on Route<br />\nOne died for a while,\" Brieger says.<br />\n\"People were into going fast. Old weigh<br />\nstations closed up in the '60's. In the<br />\n'70's [business] started picking up again.<br />\nPeople today are more into scenic<br />\nroutes.\"<br />\nBusinesses along Route One live and<br />\ndie by the volume of traffic along the<br />\nroad. The gasoline crisis of 1973, which<br />\ncurtailed much driving, was almost fatal<br />\nto some roadside enterprises. \"That<br />\nreally hurt us more than 95 opening<br />\nup,\" Brieger claimed.<br />\nOne approaches<br />\nRoute<br />\nAs<br />\nBaltimore,communities begin to appear<br />\nmore urban. The Route One here is called Belair Road. Car dealers and gas stations replace farms; people are in a<br />\ngreater hurry.

Some of<br />\nthose motels that have survived are now<br />\nbeing renovated in the hopes of attracting Baltimore's tourists. Others have<br />\ntaken on permanent residents as a means<br />\nof staying in business. Arthur's Motel<br />\nin North Laurel currently rents three out<br />\nof its seven rooms to permanent<br />\nresidents. Kay Swift, one of the proprietors, commented, \"Some people<br />\njust have nowhere to go.\"<br />\nThe town of Laurel is halfway between Baltimore and Washington. Laurel<br />\nis a new town, having been built up<br />\nwithin the last fifteen years. A racetrack<br />\nis the town's major attraction.(Hopkins<br />\nstudents may know the town better as<br />\nthe home of the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory.) Like Beltsville, College<br />\nPark and the towns that follow, Laurel<br />\nhas developed around Route One. The<br />\nmodern shopping centers and fast food<br />\nchains seen in Bel Air reappear in<br />\nLaurel. However, there are contrasts<br />\nbetween the northern and southern por-<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's suburbs. Houses are large<br />\nand lawns are well groomed. The road<br />\nquickly changes from suburban to urban as Route One leaves the state of<br />\nMaryland and enters the District of<br />\nColumbia.<br />\nFrom Maryland's northern border to<br />\nWashington D.C., Route One exhibits<br />\nmany changes: from farmland to suburbia to slums. Some parts of the road are<br />\nreminiscent of other sections miles<br />\naway. Yet every section is unique in<br />\nsome manner. Except for Baltimore, all<br />\nof the towns along Route One are<br />\ndependent on the road. Businessmen's<br />\nfates change with the ebb and flow of<br />\ntraffic.

Anderson has many<br />\nideas about what she would like<br />\nto do with the woman's program, but says she needs time<br />\nto determine the exact needs of<br />\nwomen's sports at Hopkins.<br />\nA graduate of Ursinus College with a B.S. in Health and<br />\nPhysical Education, coach<br />\nAnderson also holds an M.S. in<br />\nPhysical Education from West<br />\nChester State College in Pennsylvania, and has done<br />\ngraduate work at Penn State,<br />\nMarywood College, and<br />\nVillanova. From 1974-1982 she<br />\ntaught physical education at<br />\n<br />\nDownington High School in the varsity basketball and<br />\nPennsylvania as well as lacrosse teams, as well as being<br />\ncoaching the girl's lacrosse and co-captain of the field hockey<br />\nfield hockey teams.

She has also<br />\nattended Nationals annually,<br />\nand has played on the Ursinus<br />\nAlumnae Field Hockey team<br />\nsince 1974.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Anderson decided to<br />\ncome to Hopkins for a variety<br />\nof reasons. First, she has always<br />\nwanted to work within a collegiate system after working<br />\nwith college women during<br />\nsummer camps. She thinks that<br />\nit will be an interesting group<br />\nwith which to work. She also<br />\nfeels that it was the right time<br />\nto move \u2022on--eight years is<br />\nenough for a coach to work and<br />\nteach in a particular area. And,<br />\nfinally, the move to Hopkins<br />\nwas a step forward in her<br />\ncareer. She is now able to combine teaching, coaching and administrative work in one job.<br />\nHopkins had an opening and<br />\nshe was ready to accept it.<br />\nCoach Anderson is enthusiastic about the Hopkins<br />\nsports program. She feels her<br />\ncolleagues at the Athletic<br />\nCenter are supportive of the<br />\nWomen's program, and that<br />\nnow is the time to push it forward. She respects the women's<br />\nteams, stating that the players<br />\nare hard workers and good<br />\nathletes. A major change for<br />\nher, though, has to do with the<br />\nathletes' school work. \"I have<br />\nto understand their schedules.<br />\nThey're all doing much more<br />\n<br />\nthan playing field hockey!,\"<br />\nMs. Anderson said.<br />\nThough she has not been<br />\nhere very long, Coach Anderson has already put a few<br />\nchanges into effect - sending<br />\nout early conditioning programs and bringing the teams,<br />\nspecifically field hockey, in for<br />\nslate summer practices. She also<br />\nhopes to increase the game<br />\nschedule so as to build up the<br />\nprograms. For example, she<br />\nwould like to include more<br />\nDivision I schools, like Towson<br />\nState, in the schedule in order<br />\nto give the players experience<br />\nand the school exposure.

SMITH<br /><br />\nSteven Muller is committed to financial aid.<br /><br />\n\"Most of America's institutions of higher education. . .are<br />\nabsolutely committed that we<br />\nshall not restrict our services to<br />\nonly those who are affluent and<br />\ncan afford to pay for them,\"<br />\nJohns Hopkins University<br />\npresident Steven Muller said<br />\nSunday on the CBS news program \"Face The Nation.\"<br />\nMuller said that rising costs<br />\nand decreasing federal support<br />\nmay force universities to use<br />\nother funds in order to assist<br />\nstudents. \"That means less<br />\nfunds are left to run the<br />\nlibraries, pay faculty salaries,<br />\nand purchase expensive<br /><br />\nlaboratory equipment,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nMuller placed responsibility<br />\nfor federal financial aid cutbacks on the voters. \"The people have an opportunity to confront the question on whether<br />\nthe continuing decrease in<br />\nfederal aid is temporary. It is<br />\nthe people who must decide<br />\nwhether it is in the national interest to educate as many<br />\nAmericans as are qualified to<br />\nthe maximum of their abilities,<br />\nor whether there should be<br />\nsome arbitrary cutoff point.\"<br />\nMuller said that a sound<br />\neducational system was vital to<br />\nour nation. He said that, with<br />\nadvancing technology, jobs will<br />\nrequire higher education. There<br />\nwill be a need for engineers,<br />\ncomputer programmers, resear-<br /><br />\nchers, and others with technical<br />\nskills. These skills in turn help<br />\ncorporations develop more advanced products. Corporations<br />\nshould share education costs,<br />\nMuller added, because they<br />\nbenefit from quality education.<br />\n\"A lot of applied research is<br />\ndone in government and corporate laboratories by people<br />\ntrained at universities,\" he<br />\ncommented.<br />\nAbout half of the Hopkins<br />\nbudget is paid for by goverment<br />\ngrants or loans. Students are<br />\ncharged one-third of their \"actual tuition costs,\" the university president said.

Eisenhower Symposium, which is tentatively<br />\nscheduled for October II<br />\nthrough October 28 in Shriver<br />\nHall. The student-run lecture<br />\nseries will examine changes taking place in both the printed<br />\nand broadcast media and consider the consequences of these<br />\nchanges on society. Emphasis<br />\nwill be placed on the role of<br />\ntelevision, which is considered<br />\nby many to be the mode of<br />\ncommunication for the future.<br />\nThe Student Council chose<br />\nthis year's topic in hope of attracting large audiences. Last<br />\nyear's symposium, \"America<br />\nand the Immigrant Ex-<br /><br />\nperience,\" was plagued by poor<br />\nattendance. This year's<br />\nchairmen, Robert Lord,<br />\nMicllael Washburn, and Ellen<br />\nWilson, believe that many people from the Hopkins community will be interested in<br />\nlistening to speakers from the<br />\nmedia.<br /><br />\nSpeakers will include columnist Jack Anderson; Fred<br />\nFriendly, past president of CBS<br />\nNews and Professor Emeritus<br />\nat the Columbia School of<br />\nJournalism; and educator<br />\nLoretta Long, who plays Susan<br />\non the children's television program \"Sesame Street.\" There<br />\nwill also be a debate on moral<br />\nbetween Cal<br />\nregulation<br />\nThomas, vice-president of the<br />\nMoral Majority, and George<br />\nCunningham, of Americans for<br /><br />\nCommon Sense. Iwo additional lectures may be<br />\nscheduled.<br />\nAccording to Washburn,<br />\nfundraising for the student-run<br />\nseries has not been very successful, partially due to a late<br />\nstart and a poor business year.<br />\nThe symposium, which is offered free of charge, is funded<br />\nby the Student Council, as well<br />\nas through contributions from<br />\nprivate sources.<br /><br />\nThis is the sixteenth year of<br />\nthe symposium, whose past<br />\nspeakers include Earl Warren,<br />\nDrs.

The policy,<br />\nwhich was developed by a committee composed of several Student Council members and administrators from the Office of<br />\nStudent Activities, was introduced to the Council by<br />\nJunior Class president Mike<br />\nKun.<br />\nKun said \"There is no reason<br />\nwhy beer shouldn't be<br />\navailable, and we shouldn't<br />\nlimit events to legal students.\"<br />\nThere are five parts to the<br />\npolicy: Students will be proofed for age at the entrance to<br /><br />\nSome Area Schools<br />\nSchool Protests Accidents Harsh On Drinking<br />\nBY ROBERT INSOFT<br /><br />\nAs a result of two recent traffic accidents involving Hopkins<br />\nstudents, the Univesity has stepped up efforts to make city officials more aware of the<br />\ndangerous traffic problems<br />\nalong Charles Street and at the<br />\nintersection of St. Paul and<br />\n33rd Streets.<br />\nAccording to Assistant Dean<br />\nof Students Chris Colombo, by<br />\nnext week Chief of Security<br />\nRobert Larkin will be in contact<br />\nwith city highway officials to<br />\ndetermine the best course of action in improving the conditions facing pedestrians at these<br />\ntwo sites.

Two<br />\nyears ago the undergraduate<br />\nbrotherhood requested that the<br />\nalumni organization take over<br />\nmanagement of the large house<br />\nwhich was in need of extensive<br />\nrepair. At that time the house<br />\nwas appraised at $0; $100,000<br />\nwould be required to restore it<br />\nto reasonable condition. The<br />\nalumni were reluctant to sell the<br />\nland without first finding<br />\nanother house, so when the<br />\nCalvert School approached<br />\nthem with the offer of a property<br />\ntrade, they<br />\nbegan<br />\nnegotiations.<br />\nThe transfer was made at the<br />\nend of last May. According to<br />\nthe fraternity's recording<br />\nsecretary Charlie McManus,<br />\nthey plan to allow only three or<br />\nfour brothers to live in the<br />\nCharles St. residence instead of<br />\nthe twenty who had lived in the<br />\nold house.<br />\nTom Hollingsworth, president of the Phi Gamma Delta<br />\nAlumni Association reports<br />\nthat there had been a \"lack of<br />\npride and respect by friends and<br />\nguests of the house as well as by<br />\nmembers themselves.\" The idea<br />\nwas to tone down the atmosphere of the house.<br />\nHowever, on the evening of<br />\nthe day that the Calvert School<br />\ntook ownership of the property, a Gam member and some of<br /><br />\nhis friends reportedly vandalized the house extensively, breaking windows and the stairway<br />\nbannister. According to President of the Board of Trustees<br />\nDecatur Miller, the Calvert<br />\nSchool had never planned to<br />\nrenovate the house, so the<br />\ndamage did not affect their<br />\nplans. However there were<br />\nneighborhood complaints<br />\nabout the noise that evening<br />\nand the vandalism received<br />\nlocal television coverage.<br />\nThe publicity was embarrassing for Gam alumni and<br />\ndamaged the fraternity's chance<br />\nof rezoning the new house in<br />\nthe Charles Village area to<br />\nallow more than eight persons<br />\nto live there. McManus believes<br />\nthat it was at this point that the<br />\nalumni decided that, at least for<br />\na period of two years, no<br />\nundergraduate brothers would<br />\nbe allowed to ocupy the house.<br />\nHollingsworth reports that<br />\nthe Beta Mu Building Company's \"interest is in the<br />\nundergraduate chapter.\" He<br />\nsays, \"We're hoping for a new<br />\natmosphere...responsible individuals<br />\nlooking<br />\nfor<br />\nbrotherhood and friendship.\"<br />\nHe wants the brothers to be<br />\n\"an asset to the community,<br />\nnot just a bunch of drunken<br />\nbums -- not that they are.\"<br />\nMcManus has mixed feelings<br />\nabout the ruling. \"I don't think<br />\nits fair, but it may have been<br />\nnecessary.\" He points out that<br />\nthe present brotherhood has<br />\nmade repairs on the old house<br />\nand that it was only after they<br />\nknew it was to be abandoned<br />\nthat they stopped taking care<br />\nof it.

In a candid<br />\ndisclosure, Muller asserted that, assuming a<br />\nworst-case scenario, he would be willing to<br />\ndivert funds from research, facilities, and<br />\nfaculty salaries to the financial aid program.<br />\nIt seems, therefore, that Muller is placing a<br />\nhigher priority on equality of education than<br />\non quality of education. While such a view<br />\nmay be unpopular among Hopkins' administrators and faculty, The News-Letter<br />\ncommends this attitude.<br />\nOver the last thirty yews, the heightened<br />\nawareness of the necessity of further education combined with America's general<br />\neconomic prosperity has made educational<br />\nequality achievable without incurring any expense to the quality of education. As a result,<br />\neconomic status has, in recent years, become<br />\nof negligible importance in gaining access to<br />\ncollege.<br />\nThe conditions that originally fostered this<br />\negalitarian trend are rapidly disappearing.<br />\nFederal budget cuts are forcing universities<br />\nto make painful choices. If universities fail<br />\nto find revenue sources outside of government, the need to choose between maintaining academic integrity and retaining equality of' opportunity may become a reality.<br />\nChoosing the former at the expense of the<br />\nlatter may well be the predominant choice.<br />\nAt Hopkins, for instance, the strong political<br />\nclout of the faculty and the University's<br />\nresearch tradition will make any effort to<br /><br />\ndi\u2018eri general funds to financial aid, tedious,<br />\nif not unachievable.<br />\nThe News-Letter feels that such a development would be unfortunate. It would<br />\ndismantle the avowed purpose of financial<br />\naid: to provide quality education for quality students, not qualifying bank rolls.<br />\nWithout financial aid, enrollment in any of<br />\nthis nation's to universities would be an<br />\nunattainable dream for even the vast majority of middle class students. Curtailment or<br />\nelimination of financial aid will add to<br />\neducational, social and economic stratification in this country<br />\nBut moreover, attempts to cut back on<br />\nfinancial aid would be myopic. Johns<br />\nHopkins' reputation as a research university comes, ultimately, from the quality of its<br />\nresearchers who are, at the most basic level,<br />\nits graduate and undergraduate students. By<br />\nplacing high financial qualifications over<br />\nHopkins' traditionally high academic<br />\nqualifications, the University may find itself<br />\nin danger of tainting the latter. In the long<br />\nrun, this could hurt Hopkins' reputation<br />\nmore than the refusal of faculty members to<br />\nshare the burden of tough financial<br />\nconditions<br />\nDuring the next few years. major universities will. be searching for additional<br />\nrevenue, from industry and from alumnae,<br />\nin order to keep both high academic standards and maintain equal opportunity in<br />\nhigher &amp;education.

He<br />\nhad dressed for the occasion.<br />\nHe was wearing a black wool<br />\ncape and a suit of mail (a<br />\nmetallic get-up that's sort of<br />\nlike pop-tops from beer cans)<br />\nunderneath. Concealed in the<br />\ncape was the can of mace and<br />\nthe submachine gun. No one<br />\nwas going to push this dude<br />\naround. When he asked a question, he expected an answer. If<br />\nhe didn't get one\u2014tough. After<br />\nhe obtained his personalized<br />\nregistration permit, he was sent<br />\nto the Financial Aid table.<br />\nBrandishing his submachine<br />\ngun\u201e he quickly approached<br />\nthe clerk.<br />\n'Hello, may I help you?'<br />\n'My loan check didn't come<br />\nyet.'<br />\n`No problem, we'll just credit<br />\nhalf of it now and when it gets<br />\nhere, you can pay us.'<br />\nJonathan put the gun back,<br />\na bit dismayed that he didn't<br />\nhave to use it. No one had said,<br />\n'I-don't-know-shut-the-hellup,' or even,`oh, that's a problem for Problems\u2014NEXT!'<br />\nInstead Jonathan found good<br />\nwill. He saw his summer savings becoming useless. He<br />\ncould have bought drugs on<br />\nthose hot July nights.<br />\nFortunately, Jonathan had<br /><br />\nsecured a space in University<br />\nHousing as well. He had heard<br />\nhorror stories about the Housing Office form prior tenants.<br />\nHe decided that it would be best<br />\nto bring his mace when he went<br />\nto complain about his lumpy<br />\nhis new<br />\nmattress and<br />\nunhousebroken pets, the<br />\nroaches. Holding the can of<br />\nmace, he entered the Wolman<br />\nHall Office.<br />\n'May I help you?'<br />\n'Yes, I want a new mattress<br />\nand an exterminator.'<br />\n'That will be fine. Apartment<br />\nnumber?'<br />\n'217.'<br />\n'OK, expect them later<br />\ntoday.'<br />\nWhen they actually arrived,<br />\nJonathan went into shock. He<br />\nalmost wet his pants. He<br />\nthought he had Hopkins all<br />\nfigured out. He was obviously<br />\nvery wrong. 'Why me,' he<br />\nlamented, 'I spent all my summer wages on firearms and<br />\nhave no cause to use them.'<br />\n`Aha,' he thought,T11 visit<br />\nSharon in the SAC office. She's<br />\ngot to give me some trouble<br />\nabout the Bridge Club. Then<br />\nI'll get to use my switchblade.<br />\nI want to be sure it's sharp.'<br />\n'Come in, boss,' said<br />\nSharon. 'I was hoping to talk to<br />\nyou.'<br />\n'Of course,' remarked<br />\nJonathan as he reached for his<br />\nblade. `If it's about the<br />\ndeficit...'<br /><br />\n`No, no, I took care of that.<br />\nIt was a small deficit, so I shaved my dogs and made their fur<br />\ninto coats which I sold at<br />\nBloomingdale's. You've got<br />\nplenty of money now.'<br />\nJonathan felt himself going<br />\nover the edge. He wanted to<br />\nscream or kill or maim, but all<br />\nhe could do was stare at<br />\nSharon.<br />\n`No, I wanted to see you<br />\nbecause I wanted to know if<br /><br />\nyou were interested in an<br />\navocado Rolodex. There's an<br />\nextra one floating around here<br />\nand I know the Bridge Club<br />\ncould use one. They're very<br />\nsmart, you know. Aren't office<br />\nsupplies wonderful?'<br />\n'That's it!' he screamed.<br />\nJonathan had lost it; he<br />\ncould no longer handle all of<br />\nthese un-assholes. They were so<br />\nnice, so efficient, so damned<br /><br />\nhelpful! 'Damn it!,' he<br />\nthought,1 have to use these<br />\nweapons sometime. I guess I'll<br />\njoin HOPSFA and if they<br />\nwon't switch from swordfighting, I'll transfer to<br />\nsomeplace where clerical<br />\nworkers are still ignorant and<br />\nrude. Either that, or I'll hang<br />\nout at The Gilman Post Office.<br />\nNothing will ever change there.'<br />\nSure enough, he was right.<br /><br />\nDraft Registration<br /><br />\nNot Even Worth Worrying About<br />\nBY DON GORDON<br />\nOnce again, two and a half<br />\nyears after its resumption, the<br />\ndraft registration issue has crept<br />\nback into the news. The Reagan<br />\nAdministration, in a theatrical<br />\nplay of`get-tough' law enforcement, has deemed it the appropriate time to begin prosecuting a handful of men who<br />\ncommitted the heinous felony<br />\nof not registering, even though<br />\nthere is no draft. The Feds are<br />\nwasting their time and your<br />\nmoney.<br />\nAlas, those in another<br />\nquarter are also wasting their<br />\ntime with the subject of<br />\nregistration, and they, at least,<br />\nshould know better. I refer to<br />\nthe leaders of progressive student politics nationwide, who<br />\nhave taken up the Sasway-Eller<br />\net al. convictions as their cross<br />\nin yet another crusade against<br />\nregistration.<br />\nSetting aside the untimeliness<br />\nof a protest against registration<br />\n(if not against prosecution of<br />\nnon-registrants), they are ignorant of political reality. In<br /><br />\ntheir intensity, they distract the<br />\nongoing debate from matters of<br />\nsubstance. The registration<br />\n'issue' preempts real social concerns, at a time when the potential for political action on a rich<br />\nagenda of issues is at a high<br />\npoint.<br />\nThese progressive students<br />\nhave neglected one crucial fact:<br />\nthere is no draft. No draft is<br />\nproposed by anyone in, or even<br />\nnear, the rightward-swinging<br />\npolitical mainstream in the U.S.<br />\nAs any political observer will<br />\ntell you, constitutional amendments to ban all abortions,<br />\nmandate school prayer, and<br />\nstrip the federal courts of their<br />\nindependence have seen to it<br />\nthat the draft has not even a<br />\nchance of being introduced, let<br />\nalone passed, by Congress.<br />\nBut this doesn't stop those<br />\nwho call themselves anti-draft<br />\n(they might as well be antislavery or anti-prohibition)<br />\nfrom railing at the program.<br />\nRegistration merely speeds up<br />\nby a tiny margin the time it<br />\ntakes to raise a conscripted<br />\nmilitary. It is, in itself, nothing.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe News-Letter encourages readers to write letters to<br />\nthe editor. However, we do request that all letters be<br />\ntyped, double-spaced. Please bring all letters to the<br />\nGatehouse by Wednesday at 5 p.m.<br /><br />\nWithout even the chance of a<br />\ndraft, registration is the flimsiest of paper tigers. And so it<br />\nis as a political issue.<br />\nIt is fine to oppose the draft<br />\non ideological grounds, but<br />\nwhy fight it when nobody's<br />\nfighting for the other side? In<br />\nan attempt to beat a little controversy out of a dead issue,<br />\nsome claim darkly that the<br />\ngovernment has abolished the<br />\nconscientious objector deferment. In fact, it has not. It just<br />\nhas not made it a part of the<br />\ndetermination of eligibility,<br />\nwhich happens only once a person is drafted. Hence, no draft,<br />\nno need for C.O. status.<br />\nLet's face it. Jimmy Carter<br />\nreached for the handiest saber<br />\nand rattled it at the Soviets for<br />\nmisbehaving in Afghanistan.<br />\nRegistration served because its<br />\nmeaninglessness made it<br />\npalatable to Congress\u2014nobody<br />\ngets drafted, no constituents<br />\ncomplain. (Even so, it passed<br />\nthe House by only a narrow<br />\n219-180 margin, proving my<br />\npoint about a reflexive<br />\nresistance in Congress to<br />\nanything smacking of conscription...even during those Redbaiting weeks in 1979.) Carter<br />\nbehaved like a Cold Warrior,<br />\nplaying electoral politics with<br />\nsensitive foreign policy all the<br />\nwhile. Though that sort of<br />\npolitical gamesmanship is inexcusable, it does not lend any<br />\nmore significance to this insignificant act.<br /><br />\nThe greatest irony of all is<br />\nthat those combating the<br />\nnonexistent threat of a draft<br />\nhave been known of late to invoke the sadly poor and<br />\nworking-class makeup of the<br />\ncurrent all-volunteer force\u2014as<br />\nan argument against the draft.<br />\nHere you may be tempted to do<br />\na double-take, but you read it<br />\nright. Phillip Schinandt, in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter claimed<br />\nthat, under the current arrangement and in these times of high<br />\nunemployment, 'more poor<br />\nand middle-class youth are finding that...the only way they<br />\ncan survive economically is by<br />\njoining the military.' This is<br />\ntrue, and it is a distressing<br />\nreflection on the increasing inequality and stratification in<br />\nour society. What puzzles me is<br />\nthat, against the theme of the<br />\nentire piece, this is the most<br />\ncompelling argument for the<br />\nrevival of the draft, albeit<br />\nwithout the cushy, elitist<br />\ndeferments(not meaning those<br />\nof conscience). It is even a better argument for a universal<br />\nprogram of national service.<br />\nThe latter is the only genuinely<br />\negalitarian solution to the problem of keeping an adequate<br />\nfighting force ready at all times.<br />\nThough I doubt it will ever happen, I think it is a good idea<br />\nand would support it. I doubt<br />\nSchmandt and other antiregistrants agree, but then what<br />\nsolutions do they propose?.<br /><br />\nPAGE 6/SEPTEMBER 17, 1982<br /><br />\nHard Times Bar<br /><br />\nTHE STUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS:<br /><br />\n28th &amp; Huntington<br />\nClose to Campus<br />\nStudents Welcome<br />\nMon.

The<br />\nU.S. utilizes the satellite during<br />\nthe remaining hours and commands it from Goddard Space<br />\nCenter in Maryland.<br />\nBefore Drs.

The emissions were<br />\nfour times as intense as they expected; therefore, they could<br />\nnot be attributed solely to the<br />\nsunlight reflected from the atmosphere of Uranus.<br />\n\"The sun emits radiation in<br />\nthe Lyman alpha line,\" said<br />\nDr. Moos. \"But sixty percent<br />\nwould have to be reflected by<br />\nthe atmosphere of Uranus to<br />\nproduce the level of intensity<br />\nthat we observed.

SMITH<br />\nRoute One, America's oldest long<br />\ndistance highway, connects towns and<br />\ncities from Maine to Florida. Before the<br />\nconstruction of Interstate 95 in 1963,<br />\nRoute One was the primary road<br />\nthrough Maryland. Shops once sprang<br />\nup along the road , drawing upon the<br />\nintercity traveler for his business. In<br />\nMaryland, cities such as Baltimore totally engulf the route, but in smaller towns,<br />\nRoute One still comprises a commercial<br />\ncore.<br />\nAs you cross the Mason-Dixon line,<br />\nRoute One changes from a divided<br />\nhighway in Pennsylvania to a two lane<br />\ncountry road in Cecil County,<br />\nMaryland. A few miles north of Rising<br />\nSun, Maryland corn fields cover the rolling hills. Sprawling farms and<br />\n\u2018Noodlands vastly overwhelm the occasional house a driver passes along the<br />\nroadside. At one time most of these<br />\nfarms were owned by private families<br />\nwho grew a variety of crops. Typically,<br />\neach family owned twelve to fifteen<br />\ncows. But today, because of the expense<br />\nof modern machinery, most of these<br />\nfarms have been taken over by cooperatives or corporations.<br />\nThe hamlet of Rising Sun is demarcated by small houses lining the left side<br />\nof the road. Most of these homes were<br />\nconstructed in the 1960's. Vast farms<br />\nstill stretch out behind them.<br />\nJust south of Rising Sun, on Conowingo Road stands the Spready Oak<br />\nSnack Bar, which takes its name from<br />\na large oak tree nearby. The Snack Bar<br />\nhas been a respite for weary travelers for<br />\n27 years. \"Those were the days,\" says<br />\nMr. Johnson, the Snack Bar's owner.<br />\n\"At that time the whole place was the<br />\nsize of the kitchen. McDonald's ? There<br />\nwere very few around. Those were the<br />\ndays of frozen custard. Root beer outsold Coke five to one. We still get a lot<br />\nof vacationers along this route. It hasn't<br />\nchanged that much.\"<br />\nMr. Johnson remembers that when he<br />\nlived along Route One as a child during<br />\nthe Depression, people would travel up<br />\nand down the road, carrying carts with<br />\ntheir belongings, searching for whatever<br />\nwork they could find. But Mr. Johnson,<br />\nthough he still loves the area, is concerned about possible changes, such as the<br />\ninflux of heavy industry.<br />\nThe Conowingo Dam marks the first<br />\nmajor topographical change along<br />\nRoute One. The dam blocks the Sus-<br /><br />\nquehanna river ten miles north of the<br />\nChesapeake Bay. The dam serves as<br />\nRoute One's bridge across the Susquehanna River. Howe\u2018er, this year the<br />\nbridge is under repair and travelers must<br />\nfollow a detour onto Interstate 1-95.<br />\nThis has caused heavy financial losses<br />\nfor the businesses along this section of<br />\nRoute One. The repercussions of the<br />\nrepair are felt on both sides of the river,<br />\nfrom Rising Sun to Bel Air. The Conowingo Diner, for instance, has lost 35<br />\npercent of its business due to the<br />\nconstruction.<br />\nBuddy has owned the diner for six<br />\nyears.. \"People used to come across the<br />\nbridge and come here to eat. We have<br />\nregular customers on the other side of<br />\nthe river, but they don't come here<br />\nbecause of the repairs,\" says Buddy, adding that other businesses, such as the<br />\nKwik Stop Snack Bar, have lost even<br />\nmore business than the diner.<br />\nBefore the bridge was closed, the<br />\n24-hour diner served mostly breakfasts<br />\nand dinners. \"We also got a lot of latenight weekend drinkers,\" Buddy brags.<br />\n\"You know, high school students who'd<br />\ncome here after drinking.\"Now most of<br />\nthe patrons are the workmen and those<br />\nwho live on the north side of the river.<br />\nIn about a year, when work is completed, Buddy expects to be serving<br />\nmore truckers, who have been<br />\ndiscouraged from using the road since<br />\nrepairs began in 1980.<br />\nAcross the dam, in Harford County,<br />\nthe road is less rural. Houses appear<br />\nmore frequently; farms are smaller.<br />\nNearby is the town of Bel Air, the<br />\nlargest Route One town north of<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nJust outside of Bel Air is the Hickory<br />\nInn Motel.

Some of<br />\nthose motels that have survived are now<br />\nbeing renovated in the hopes of attracting Baltimore's tourists. Others have<br />\ntaken on permanent residents as a means<br />\nof staying in business. Arthur's Motel<br />\nin North Laurel currently rents three out<br />\nof its seven rooms to permanent<br />\nresidents. Kay Swift, one of the proprietors, commented, \"Some people<br />\njust have nowhere to go.\"<br />\nThe town of Laurel is halfway between Baltimore and Washington. Laurel<br />\nis a new town, having been built up<br />\nwithin the last fifteen years. A racetrack<br />\nis the town's major attraction.(Hopkins<br />\nstudents may know the town better as<br />\nthe home of the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory.) Like Beltsville, College<br />\nPark and the towns that follow, Laurel<br />\nhas developed around Route One. The<br />\nmodern shopping centers and fast food<br />\nchains seen in Bel Air reappear in<br />\nLaurel. However, there are contrasts<br />\nbetween the northern and southern por-<br /><br />\nBaltimore's suburbs. Houses are large<br />\nand lawns are well groomed. The road<br />\nquickly changes from suburban to urban as Route One leaves the state of<br />\nMaryland and enters the District of<br />\nColumbia.<br />\nFrom Maryland's northern border to<br />\nWashington D.C., Route One exhibits<br />\nmany changes: from farmland to suburbia to slums. Some parts of the road are<br />\nreminiscent of other sections miles<br />\naway. Yet every section is unique in<br />\nsome manner. Except for Baltimore, all<br />\nof the towns along Route One are<br />\ndependent on the road. Businessmen's<br />\nfates change with the ebb and flow of<br />\ntraffic. A gasoline shortage , construction of a major highway, or the repair<br />\nof a bridge can spell doom for any of<br />\nthese communities. Suburban sprawl<br />\nand population growth can bring prosperity. Perhaps Route One does not<br />\nrepresent a very complete picture of<br />\nMaryland, but the slice of life it carves<br />\nprovides much insight into the nature<br />\nand impact of the American Road.<br /><br />\nFeatures<br /><br />\nPAGE 12/SEPTEMBER 17, 1982<br /><br />\nInternational<br />\nThe<br />\nStudies Forum presents<br />\nProfessor Chase Dunn<br />\nof the JHU Department<br />\nof Social Relations who<br />\nwill discuss<br /><br />\nrepo\u00b0000000000000a)<br />\n0<br /><br />\nWORLD WAR V<br />\nthose interested in International Relations should attend on Tuesday, September<br />\n21 at 7:30 p.m. in the Garrett Room.<br />\nAll<br /><br />\no<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\no<br />\no<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\no<br /><br />\n\u00b0<br /><br />\no<br /><br />\nO<br />\n0<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0o<br />\nre) c)<br />\nCi)<br />\nalo<br />\n0 N<br />\n1-<br /><br />\no<br />\no<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nch 0<br />\nz (2,1<br /><br />\n1.)<br />\n80<br />\nO (..)<br />\n4-4<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\nE 0<br />\nO 4.1<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nL)g0<br />\nZN<br />\nN fa,<br />\n0<br />\nr<br /><br />\nz<br /><br />\nE-4<br /><br />\nCAW<br /><br />\nIIMIL<br />\nINIII<br />\n=I<br />\nMI 6111 men<br /><br />\nMI<br /><br />\n.-4<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nus<br /><br />\nMI 11111<br />\nINI 111111<br /><br />\nIII<br /><br />\nMeeting for Worship at 11<br /><br />\na.M.<br /><br />\n235-4438<br /><br />\nSENIOR CLASS FILM SERIES<br /><br />\nALIEN<br /><br />\n0<br />\n40<br />\n\u00b0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\no<br /><br />\nI=<br /><br />\nA friendly welcome awaits you at Homewood Friends<br />\nMeeting House, 3107 North Charles Street.

Although she is<br />\nyoung, she has had more than<br />\nenough experience in teaching,<br />\ncoaching and administrative<br />\nwork to fill her position here as<br />\nWoman's Coordinator at the<br />\nAthletic Center and head coach<br />\nof the field hockey and<br />\nwomen's lacrosse teams.<br />\nAnderson began her work<br />\nthis season after coach Michul<br />\nAnne Morse decided to retire<br />\nfrom her position last spring<br />\nafter eight years at the Athletic<br />\nCenter. Anderson has many<br />\nideas about what she would like<br />\nto do with the woman's program, but says she needs time<br />\nto determine the exact needs of<br />\nwomen's sports at Hopkins.<br />\nA graduate of Ursinus College with a B.S. in Health and<br />\nPhysical Education, coach<br />\nAnderson also holds an M.S. in<br />\nPhysical Education from West<br />\nChester State College in Pennsylvania, and has done<br />\ngraduate work at Penn State,<br />\nMarywood College, and<br />\nVillanova. From 1974-1982 she<br />\ntaught physical education at<br /><br />\nDownington High School in the varsity basketball and<br />\nPennsylvania as well as lacrosse teams, as well as being<br />\ncoaching the girl's lacrosse and co-captain of the field hockey<br />\nfield hockey teams.

She has also<br />\nattended Nationals annually,<br />\nand has played on the Ursinus<br />\nAlumnae Field Hockey team<br />\nsince 1974.<br /><br />\nCoach Anderson decided to<br />\ncome to Hopkins for a variety<br />\nof reasons. First, she has always<br />\nwanted to work within a collegiate system after working<br />\nwith college women during<br />\nsummer camps. She thinks that<br />\nit will be an interesting group<br />\nwith which to work. She also<br />\nfeels that it was the right time<br />\nto move \u2022on--eight years is<br />\nenough for a coach to work and<br />\nteach in a particular area. And,<br />\nfinally, the move to Hopkins<br />\nwas a step forward in her<br />\ncareer. She is now able to combine teaching, coaching and administrative work in one job.<br />\nHopkins had an opening and<br />\nshe was ready to accept it.<br />\nCoach Anderson is enthusiastic about the Hopkins<br />\nsports program. She feels her<br />\ncolleagues at the Athletic<br />\nCenter are supportive of the<br />\nWomen's program, and that<br />\nnow is the time to push it forward. She respects the women's<br />\nteams, stating that the players<br />\nare hard workers and good<br />\nathletes. A major change for<br />\nher, though, has to do with the<br />\nathletes' school work. \"I have<br />\nto understand their schedules.<br />\nThey're all doing much more<br /><br />\nthan playing field hockey!,\"<br />\nMs. Anderson said.<br />\nThough she has not been<br />\nhere very long, Coach Anderson has already put a few<br />\nchanges into effect - sending<br />\nout early conditioning programs and bringing the teams,<br />\nspecifically field hockey, in for<br />\nslate summer practices. She also<br />\nhopes to increase the game<br />\nschedule so as to build up the<br />\nprograms. For example, she<br />\nwould like to include more<br />\nDivision I schools, like Towson<br />\nState, in the schedule in order<br />\nto give the players experience<br />\nand the school exposure. She<br />\nplans to increase interest in the<br />\nwomen's sports program by actively recruiting, and by selling<br />\nthe school through publicity<br />\npamphlets sent to high schools.<br />\nThis, in turn, will bring in more<br />\nfreshman talent, which will<br />\nthen strengthen the teams and<br />\nthe program.<br />\nThe field hockey team is<br />\nespecially interested in working<br />\nfor its new coach. One player<br />\nfeels that, although Coach<br />\nAnderson makes the team work<br />\nhard, she also makes it fun.
