Held in<br />\nShriver Hall, the third program<br />\nof this year's MSE Symposium<br />\ndrew approximately 200 people, roughly half of whom were<br />\nHopkins students. The discussion revolved around a<br />\nhypothetical situation Friendly<br />\nproposed: the dilemma of a<br />\nnewspaper reporter when he<br />\nlearns of a fabulous story which<br />\nposes a hazard to national<br />\nsecurity. The ethical and legal<br />\naspects of this and other situations, both real and fictitious,<br />\nwere discussed by the panel and<br />\nalso by members of the audience, as Friendly sought audience participation.<br />\nThe panel consisted of:<br />\nJoseph Sterne, editorial page<br />\neditor of the Baltimore Sun;<br />\nMichael J.

Friendly is Edward R.<br />\nMurrow professor emeritus of<br />\nbroadcast journalism of Columbia University Graduate<br />\nSchool of Journalism.<br />\nBefore beginning, Friendly<br />\nasked the audience to move forward to promote unity between<br />\naudience and panel.

She also said that<br />\nthe security problems were the<br />\nfault of the JSA, because they<br />\nhad entered Levering Hall<br />\nagainst University regulations.<br />\nThamer said the problem with<br />\nthe Speaker Committee had<br />\noccurred only once, and arose<br />\nout of ignorance on the part of<br />\nthe PSU. As to the charge of a<br />\nclosed meeting, she said that the<br />\nstudent in question was invited<br />\nto join the meeting; he refused<br />\nand was asked to leave the<br />\nroom because the PSU was<br />\ndiscussing a very confidential<br />\nmatter.

He said he<br />\nbelieved the committee could<br />\nhave 1000 signatures by Monday. Because of this overwhelming student support,<br />\nCampbell said he felt the council should take action on the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nTwo different motions were<br />\npassed, both proposed by<br />\nDarlene Marshall. The first<br />\nstated only that the council<br />\nwished \"to voice its protest<br />\nagainst the Ku Klux Klan and<br />\nthe racist views they represent,<br />\nbecause of the overwhelming<br />\nresponse of the student body<br />\nagainst the Klan.\" The second<br />\nmotion stated that \"We, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University Student Council, support the antiKlan rally...because of the<br />\noverwhelming response of the<br />\n<br />\nstudent body against the Klan.\"<br />\nBefore either motion passed,<br />\nCouncil Treasurer Harry Davis<br />\nattempted to introduce a<br />\nsubstitute motion banning the<br />\ncouncil from taking any future<br />\nstands on \"national and international public policy.\" When<br />\nDavis tried to introduce his motion as a substitute for Marshall's, he was ruled out of<br />\norder by Council President<br />\nDoug Fellman.<br />\n<br />\nwhether or not we were going<br />\nto debate it.\"<br />\nThroughout the meeting,<br />\nDavis had strongly opposed the<br />\ncouncil taking a stand on the<br />\nKlan issue. \"The council is not<br />\na political body,\" he said,<br />\n<br />\nDavis, therefore, reintroduced his motion after Marshall's<br />\nhad passed. The vote of the<br />\ncouncil was a tie, allowing<br />\nFellman to vote. He voted no,<br />\nkilling the motion. After tile<br />\nmeeting, Fellman stated he was<br />\nopposed to the council's taking<br />\na stand on political issues, but<br />\nthat he killed Davis' motion<br />\nbecause \"under Harry's motion, if a political issue ever<br />\ncame to the council, we would<br />\nspend two hours debating<br />\n<br />\ntative Tim Gilbreath disagreed,<br />\nhowever. \"I think we misrepresent the students and do a<br />\ndisservice to the students by ignoring issues they have chosen<br />\nto make a part of their lives,\"<br />\nhe said.<br />\n<br />\nCommittee Recommends New<br />\nLibrary For Dorm Dining Hall<br />\nBY ETHAN RARICK<br />\n<br />\nChris Campbell argues against KKK.<br />\n<br />\nalthough he stressed that he was<br />\nopposed to the Klan and that he<br />\nhad signed the petition. \"I<br />\nthink it would be absolutely<br />\nwrong if the council moved on<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nSophomore Class Represen-<br />\n<br />\nProvost Richard Longaker<br />\nhas appointed a committee of<br />\nfaculty members, administrators and students to consider<br />\nThe possibility of using the dining facilities in the old dorms as<br />\na library.

Elections are<br />\nsimply not determined by just the<br />\nthoughts and feelings of the individual<br />\nvoters on election day. Voters are influenced by a wide range of events,<br />\nmany occuring over a period of years or<br />\neven generations. For some, historical<br />\nparty affiliation spanning over one hundred years outweighs any particular<br />\nissue or set of issues in which the individual may disagree with his party. In<br />\nother words, even though President<br />\nCarter's popularity in 1980 was only<br />\nabout 25 percent, he was still able to<br />\ngarner 41 percent of the popular vote,<br />\nin large part due to the fact that he was<br />\nthe Democratic candidate. This will<br />\nlikewise be true in 1982.<br />\nFuthermore, there are trends which<br />\ntake place in elections and these trends<br />\nare not to be ignored. In every election<br />\nin the 20th century, the party which has<br />\ncontrolled the White House has lost<br />\nseats in the following election with the<br />\nsingle exception of 1934. Instead of this<br />\nbeing a peculiar phenomenon, current<br />\n. thought in political science reveals an explanation. It is generally agreed that the<br />\nelectorate in off-term elections is<br />\nsignificantly indifferent to that of<br />\npresidential elections when about 80 percent more people go to the polls. It is<br />\nbelieved that a larger percentage of those<br />\nturning out to vote on midterm elections<br />\nare doing so in order to vote against the<br />\nparty which happens to be in power.<br />\nThus, if the Republicans lose seats up<br />\nto a certain point, it simply cannot be<br />\nseen as a defeat of the policies of President Reagan.<br />\n<br />\nWhat this delimits, then, is the question which is most thoroughly debated.<br />\nDuring the first midterm election for a<br />\nparty in power, the average number of<br />\nseats lost is 12. Further, the average<br />\nnumber lost since 1952 has also been 12;<br />\nrecently Nixon lost 12 and Carter lost<br />\n15. Therefore, if one is looking for signs<br />\nthe failure or success of Reagan, this is<br />\nthe number to look for.<br />\nBut this is not to say that if Reagan<br />\nloses 13 seats that his program is rejected<br />\nby the country as a whole. Clearly, this<br />\nwould be ludicrous when one is looking<br />\nat the results of 435 individual contests.<br />\nFurthermore, Senate and gubernatorial<br />\nraces are not considered to be an accurate indication of a president's success<br />\nbecause of the peculiarities which exist<br />\nin each particular case. Therefore, while<br />\nit is correct to look for signs of success<br />\nor failure of the Reagan agenda in the<br />\nHouse races, it is not clear what the<br />\nvarious numbers will mean. If Reagan<br />\nloses fewer than 13 seats, it is certainly<br />\na victory (moral at least) for the<br />\nRepublicans. If the Republicans lose<br />\nmore than 25 or so, the picture is murky,<br />\nand one's interpretations will undoubtedly rest on one's party affiliation.<br />\nIn particular, however, there are a<br />\nnumber of fascinating races which will<br />\nbe intensely watched across the nation.<br />\nClose races in which the Republicans, I<br />\nbelieve, have the upper hand are Pete<br />\nWilson over Jerry Brown for Senate in<br />\nCalifornia; Lowell Weiker in Connecticut; Millicent Fenwick in New Jersey;<br />\nJim Thompson for governor or Adlai<br />\nStevenson II in Illinois. Also, likely<br />\nRepublican gains are to be found in the<br />\nSenate race in Virginia, a gain of House<br />\nseats in Florida, North Carolina,<br />\nArizona, Utah, Colorado, Texas,<br />\nOregon and Washington. Most<br />\nDemocratic gains will come from governor positions, particularly in Michigan,<br />\nWisconsin, Ohio and Arkansas. While<br />\nhate to predict Republican Senate<br />\nlosses, close races are to be found in<br />\nNew Mexico, Missouri and Minnesota.<br />\nAnd in Maryland, well, at least the<br />\nRepublicans won't be any worse off<br />\nthan they presently are. We wish Pascal<br />\nand Hogan well, but if they can break<br />\nthrough the 40 percent mark they will<br />\nbe doing well.<br />\nOverall then, I believe we are looking<br />\nin the area of seven Democratic gains in<br />\nthe gubernatorial contests, a washout in<br />\nthe Senate, and a gain of only about 15<br />\nseats in the House.

Mirsky said<br />\nhe was twice asked to join the<br />\nmeeting, but declined. Later,<br />\nTreasurer<br />\nPSU<br />\nPhilip<br />\nSchmandt asked Mirsky to go<br />\ninside the council office.

At that point,<br />\nMirsky said Schmandt told him<br />\nto go downstairs if he could not<br />\ngo in the council office. Mirsky<br />\nfelt this was a clear violation of<br />\nthe SAC's open meeting rule.<br />\nSchmandt, who was also present at the meeting, stated that<br />\nhe had asked Mirsky to leave<br />\nbecause the PSU was about to<br />\ndiscuss a confidential matter.<br />\nThe board chose not to take<br />\naction on this issue at this time.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE-7<br />\n<br />\nOffering<br />\nStudent<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nWith<br />\n1.D.<br />\n<br />\nHAIR STUDIO<br />\n<br />\nWOIMAN hal<br />\n<br />\nAccording to Davis, a separate SAA is needed because,<br />\n\"it is not a part of the responsibilities of the SAC t.o support<br />\nsports groups.\" The SAC<br />\ndecided that it cannot support<br />\nsports groups, just like it would<br />\nnot support single-issue clubs.<br />\nDavis added that the sports<br />\ngroups cannot be supported by<br />\nthe Athletic Center due to a<br />\nlack of funds.<br />\nAthletic Center Director Bab<br />\nScott confirmed this statement,<br />\nadding that the only club supported by the Athletic Center,<br />\nthe Water Polo Club, is mostly<br />\nfinanced through funds from<br />\nthe alumni associations.<br />\nHowever, Davis sees a<br />\n\"void\" between the SAC and<br />\nAthletic Center. He feels that it<br />\nshould be filled by the creation<br />\nof a \"separate, autonomous<br />\norganization.\"<br />\nSports groups presently in<br />\n<br />\nthe SAC are the Karate, Sailing, Bicycle, Ski, Outdoors and<br />\nRowing clubs. Students have<br />\nalso petitioned the SAC to support Akido, Judo, Racquetball<br />\nand Bowling clubs.

He says,\"A group that<br />\ncompetes as a team should not<br />\nbe in the SAC.\" He added that<br />\nthe sports clubs in the SAC<br />\nhave already requested funds<br />\nfor competitive purposes.<br />\nDean Colombo feels that instead of creating a separate<br />\nSAA, the SAC should reevaluate its position concerning<br />\ncompetitive groups. Colombo<br />\nsays that the reason that the<br />\nSAC was set up was to let the<br />\nstudents, rather than the Administration, decide what<br />\ngroups should be on campus.<br />\nHe feels, therefore, that all stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent groups should be considered. \"The SAC Executive<br />\nBoard may have to expand [its]<br />\nvision,\" says Colombo. He<br />\npoints out that none of the<br />\nsports groups that he has talked to want to be under the control of the Athletic Center; they<br />\nonly want to use its facilities.<br />\nThe Rowing Club, however,<br />\nhas already expressed an interest in becoming a varsity<br />\nteam. Colombo also points out<br />\nthat due to the tightness of<br />\nmoney, the clubs in the SAA<br />\nmay not be able to travel to<br />\ncompetitions anyway.<br />\nIt is the lack of money that<br />\nforms the basis of the issue.<br />\nDavis says that the SAC cannot<br />\nafford to pay the travel expenses of the sports groups.<br />\nNevertheless, Colombo feels<br />\nthat the SAC must decide which<br />\nindividual groups will best meet<br />\nthe needs of the students.<br />\n<br />\nfoR AppoiramENTs:<br />\nL 338-1126<br />\nI CAR<br />\n<br />\nSUBS<br />\nSANDWICHES<br />\nHOT PLATTERS<br />\nSOUPS&SALADS<br />\n<br />\nFOR INSURANCE CALL<br />\n<br />\n(SheilW!Goff4<br />\nDRINKS<br />\nDESSERTS<br />\nDAILY SPECIALS<br />\nPARTY TRAYS<br />\nCARRY OUT AVAILABLE<br />\n3501 St. Paul Street (The Marylander Apts.)<br />\nOpen 7 Days a Week 7 AM -7PM<br />\n235-0444<br />\nEntrance on University Pkwy.<br />\n<br />\nChuck Morgan<br />\n717 Light St.<br />\n[near the Science Center]<br />\n659-6800<br />\n<br />\nLike a good neighbor,<br />\nState Farm is there.<br />\nState Faun Insurance Compan,es<br />\nHorne Offices Bloomington Illinois<br />\n<br />\nUniyerstty and 33rd St.<br />\nDaily: 10 AM -2 AM<br />\nPhone ahead 467 - 1022<br />\n<br />\n\fP<br />\ntLfac<br />\nc<br />\nig<br />\nT ER<br />\n6Z1<br />\n<br />\nTells All<br />\n<br />\nWhat's It Like Attending Medical School?<br />\nBY MICHAEL FINGERHOOD<br />\nYou're probably saying to<br />\nyourself, \"That name in the<br />\nbyline sounds familiar.

It is a rather simple process, although timeconsuming and usually quite<br />\nfrustrating to the investigator,<br />\nthe professor doing the<br />\nresearch.<br />\nThe professor first formulates an idea for a workable<br />\nproject. He gets his ideas mostly through discussion with colleagues, by raising questions<br />\nabout work he or others are<br />\npresently doing, or by reading<br />\ncurrent literature. An active..<br />\nresearcher is constantly coming<br />\ninto contact with new ideas.<br />\nOnce this is done, the professor<br />\nmust write up a proposal for<br />\nsubmission to a funding<br />\nagency.<br />\nThe proposal determines if<br />\nthe project receives funding or<br />\nnot, and for this reason, almost<br />\nas much research goes into the<br />\nproposal as goes into the<br />\nproject.<br />\nThe professor must be<br />\nfamiliar with all the work currently being done on his particular subject. This is to assure<br />\nthe agency that he knows the<br />\nbackground of the area. According to Professor Steven<br />\nStanley, of the Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences Department,<br />\nit is important not to infringe<br />\nupon the research of others.<br />\nThe proposal submitted by<br />\nthe professor must convince the<br />\nreviewers, a council of peers<br />\nwho discuss the validity of the<br />\nproposal, that the scope of the<br />\nproject is large enough to be<br />\nworthwhile to the agency, yet<br />\nsmall enough to be tractable. It<br />\nis also important that the project being proposed will result<br />\n<br />\nin tangible data, because it's<br />\ndifficult to obtain funding for<br />\ntheoretical work.<br />\nStanley submits only one<br />\nproposal at a time, due to his<br />\ninterest in many different<br />\nfields, all requiring a full<br />\nlaboratory. It would be possible for him to submit more than<br />\none proposal if he bad access to<br />\na large lab, and if he had<br />\nassistants capable of handling<br />\nsuch variety. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe University's budget does<br />\nthis.<br />\nnot<br />\n<br />\nDr. Ales Nit! oft<br />\nMeanwhile, Professor Alex<br />\nNickon, of the Chemistry<br />\nDepartment, says it is quite<br />\ncommon for chemists to submit<br />\nmore than one proposal at a<br />\ntime. If the investigator is<br />\nresearching various topics<br />\nwithin one subject, he will submit all the projects under one<br />\nproposal. If the topics,<br />\nhowever, are all in different<br />\nareas, he will submit one proposal for each project, often<br />\nsubmitting one to an agency.<br />\nMost of the projects are<br />\nongoing, thus requiring<br />\nrenewable grants.

Professor J.C.<br />\nWalker, of the Physics Department, operates over the same<br />\nlength of time, hoping to get<br />\nmost of his work done in the<br />\nfirst two years of a three-year<br />\ngrant. This is to increase the<br />\nprobability of a renewal of the<br />\ngrant.<br />\nNickon says projects are<br />\nrarely tied up. Part of the project can be completed, but there<br />\nis no final solution. The project<br />\ncontinues, though, often with a<br />\nchange in emphasis. Professor<br />\nSaul Roseman of the Biology<br />\nDepartment agrees, sayini that<br />\nprojects usually do not continue<br />\nindefinitely. The more answers<br />\nfound, the more questions are<br />\nraised.<br />\nStanley, however, usually<br />\nfinishes his work within two<br />\nyears, and he has not yet received a renewal to continue his<br />\nwork beyond the original time<br />\nof the grant.<br />\nDr. David Olton, of<br />\nPsychology, says projects<br />\nusually continue as long as<br />\nthere is money, and that there<br />\nare some short-term projects of<br />\nabout six months, though some<br />\ncan continue for 10-20 years.<br />\nMost of the professors conducting research also teach<br />\nclasses, so they usually serve as<br />\nadvisors in their research. Therefore, they rely mostly on<br />\ngraduate students, with perhaps<br />\nsome undergraduates and postdoctoral research technicians,<br />\ndepending on the extent of the<br />\nproject.<br />\nMost of the professors do<br />\ntheir research without constant<br />\ncollaboration with other colleagues. Group work, though,<br />\nis often necessary to obtain the<br />\nbest results. Some collaboration<br />\nis also done with faculty from<br />\nother institutions, especially if<br />\nthose professors have access to<br />\nequipment not available at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe majority of the proposals are sent to the National<br />\nFoundation, a<br />\nScience<br />\nsomewhat smaller amount to<br />\nthe National Institute of<br />\nHealth, and a smattering to<br />\nvarious other agencies, such as<br />\nthe Department of Defense,<br />\nthe U.S. Army and National<br />\nGeographic.<br />\nAccording to Olton, a proposal is sent anywhere and<br />\neverywhere, depending, of<br />\ncourse, on whether the agency<br />\nhas a tendency to fund such<br />\nproposals.<br />\nThough some of the professors have not yet had a proposal not funded, others have<br />\n<br />\nhad this happen \"often their academic salary is for nine<br />\nenough,\" according to Olton, months of the year.

An increased number of subdivisions<br />\nwould help investigators in<br />\nstructuring their proposals.<br />\nThe delay time between submitting the propsal and receiving the grant ranges from six to<br />\neighteen months.<br />\nAccording to Olton, suitable<br />\ngrants are not always received<br />\nto cover all the needs of the<br />\nresearch. This problem is solved in several ways. Walker<br />\noften arranges collaborations<br />\nwith people in other institutions. He works with some people in Germany because they<br />\nhave instruments which are better than the \"outdated\" ones at<br />\nHopkins. He also has to cut<br />\nback on how much pay goes to<br />\nassistants and how much equipment is bought.<br />\nNickon says that research<br />\nwith a smaller grant proceeds<br />\nnoticeably slower because the<br />\nnumber of assistants has to be<br />\ncut back. He often has to<br />\nredirect his emphasis towards a<br />\ndifferent goal and do the best<br />\nhe can with what is given.<br />\nAccording to Roseman,<br />\neesearchers must suffer and<br />\nstruggle. Low funding is a major problem because funding is<br />\nso hard to get.<br />\nThe University acts as a<br />\nfinancial agent. It is given the<br />\nmoney offered by the grant in<br />\none lump sum per year, and this<br />\nmoney is doled out to the investigator, who is given an account.

Though<br />\nthis virus has been a part of western civilization for<br />\nat least two thousand years, studies currently indicate that herpes simplex types I and 2 are<br />\ndangerously on the rise. Whether this should be<br />\ncausefor alartn is important; actually, the medical<br />\nprofession seems to give the alleged herpes epidemic<br />\nmixed reviews, both in terms of the validity of the<br />\nstatistical claims and in terms of the severity of<br />\ndamage that herpes can cause. Unlike syphilis or<br />\ngonorrhea, herpes is at present incurable, and the<br />\neffectiveness of even the most recent advances in<br />\ntreatment is in serious question. There has,<br />\nhowever, been some exaggeration in the media attention paid to the genital herpes matter over the<br />\npast several months. This article is afresh attempt<br />\nto assess the current state of herpes in our society,<br />\nprovide an indication of future medical<br />\ndevelopments dealing with herpes and elucidate<br />\nwhat this all means to us now, with the focus on<br />\nthe way herpes is making itselffelt on this and other<br />\ncampuses.<br />\n<br />\nconglomeration, though seemingly sturdy, can not<br />\nsurvive outside the body, and therefore can only be<br />\ntransmitted by direct contact. Once in the body,<br />\nhowever, it replicates very quickly, leading to the<br />\nexternal eruptions previously described.<br />\nAbout a half-million new cases of herpes simplex<br />\n'develop each year; half of these won't display any<br />\n;recurrent symptoms. However, since herpes is at<br />\nthis time incurable, the number of carriers never<br />\ndecreases. The emotional effects of herpes are astounding. Victims may suffer shock, fear, anger,<br />\ndeepening depression and a sense of hopelessness,<br />\nin part because of the tremendous reputation herpes<br />\nhas gained in recent years. There have been a<br />\nnumber of suicides resulting from extreme fear of<br />\nthe disease.<br />\n<br />\nWHAT HERPES IS<br />\n<br />\nThe search for a cure for herpes has been in full<br />\nswing for almost a decade, and most experimental<br />\ndrugs have proven ineffective. Nonetheless, last<br />\nspring, acyclovir was approved by the Food and<br />\nDrug Administration as useful in preventing herpes<br />\ntype 1 and herpes zoster (an acute viral infection<br />\nof the skin) infections from spreading; it cannot prevent the actual transmission of the virus. This<br />\ndiscovery was the result of test tube experiments and<br />\n<br />\nThe herpes viruses come in various types., including those responsible for common chicken pox<br />\nand shingles. The types attracting the most attention now, however, are herpes simplex type 1, which<br />\ncauses the eruption of cold sores and blisters on the<br />\nlace and upper body, and herpes simplex type 2,<br />\nalso known as genital herpes, which has been linked to cancer of the cervix, and can be passed on<br />\nto newborn infants. The primary transmission of<br />\ngenital herpes occurs through sexual contact, and,<br />\nn fact, the distinction between types 1 and 2 is<br />\nDecoming more fuzzy, in part, it is theorized, due<br />\nto oral sex. It seems that an active type 1 infection<br />\non the face easily can be transmitted to the genital<br />\nregion; likewise an active type 2 eruption on the<br />\ngenitalia can be transmitted to the partner's face,<br />\nand cause similar infection there.<br />\nThe typical onset of a herpes simplex attack is<br />\nfirst noticed within four days of transmission, when<br />\nsmall red bumps erupt, turning into blisters which<br />\ndry into crusty sores. Though these sores may heal<br />\nand vanish within one or two weeks, the herpes<br />\nvirus itself retreats within the body's nerve tissues.<br />\nFor about half of those who contract herpes, the<br />\ninitial flare-up is not repeated. However, recurrent<br />\nattacks are known to occur up to several times per<br />\nyear in many herpes victims. The factors contributing to these recurrences will be discussed later.<br />\nAbout 90 percent of the U.S. population has been<br />\nexposed to type 1, while approximately 60 percent<br />\nof the population has been exposed to the type 2<br />\nvirus. Health officials say simplex type 2 has only<br />\nbecome a major problem since the mid-1970s, when<br />\nthe percentage of those afflicted with the disease<br />\nskyrocketed. Type 2 appears as external lesions on<br />\nthe genitalia which last for about two weeks at a<br />\ntime. In women, the lesions may erupt inside the<br />\nvagina as well. The side effects of herpes are wideranged, and include fever. In its most severe forms,<br />\nthis virus may lead to meningitis, and could even<br />\nbe fatal.<br />\nThough it has been suggested that immunity to<br />\nthe herpes virus, through increased contact to colds<br />\nand infections in the early years of life, Dr. Laure<br />\nAurelian, a researcher associated with the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, maintains that \"There is absolutely no documented evidence to substantiate any<br />\nsuch conclusion. Immunity, per se, to the herpes<br />\nsimplex has no where been authenticated to date,<br />\nand any suggestion of such an immunity is a<br />\nfalsehood.\"<br />\nThe recurrence of' herpes four or five times a year<br />\nmay be triggered by injury, colds, sunburn, stress<br />\nor fever, among other things. Dr. John Skouge, dermatology specialist with Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nconjectures that\" a woman afflicted with the herpes<br />\nsimplex may suffer a relapse when having a period<br />\nduring the monthly cycle. A second explanation has<br />\nbeen linked to mental stress or negative emotions.<br />\nThat is to say, people having the herpes simplex may<br />\nexperience a sharp recurrence when their mood or<br />\nemotions drop.\"<br />\nWhile it is inactive, after it has temporarily<br />\nretreated to a group of nerve cells near the base of<br />\nthe spine, it is dormant, and can not be transmitted. The herpes cell itself is four times the size of<br />\na common cold virus. It is composed of DNA,surrounded by protective layers of dense polymers and<br />\nwrapped in a water-tight membrane of fats. This<br />\n<br />\nACYCLOVIR:<br />\nAN ANSWER?<br />\n<br />\nHERPES ON CAMPUS<br />\nAND OFF<br />\nAccording to the Hopkins Health Clinic, the<br />\nherpes situation on campus is becoming very<br />\nserious. \"We feel that we are seeing more herpes<br />\nthan in the past,\" says Director Joan Rehner, and<br />\nas a result, the staff has been addressing the situation in an effort to control the problem, the size<br />\nof which has been estimated at\"one to five cases<br />\na week, some of them recurrent.\"<br />\nThe clinic's main efforts are geared toward giving the patients accurate information on herpes, and<br />\ntalking to them to lessen the psychological pains<br />\nupon diagnosis of herpes. Once herpes is diagnosed, the staff tries to get the patient to talk openly,<br />\nbecause herpes is often \"psychologically traumatizing for them,\" says Rehner. They also give the patients pertinent information since \"a lot of them<br />\nhave a lot of misconceptions about the disease.\"<br />\nBesides helping the victims to deal with the<br />\npsychological effects of the disease, the health clinic<br />\ndoes, on occasion, give out acyclovir, which can be<br />\nobtained in ointment or systemic form. They also<br />\nemphasize to all that it is definitely helpful in controlling the disease if the male wears a condom during sexual intercourse.<br />\nThe center is also considering establishing a selfhelp group for herpes sufferers. Mimi Bianchi and<br />\nthe members of the Student Health Advisory Committee support the idea. Rehner, however, feels that<br />\nthis will be difficult to organize since the afflicted<br />\n<br />\nerpes:<br />\nscientists are not sure it will be totally effective. New<br />\nforms of acyclovir will hopefully speed healing and<br />\ndiminish spreading of the disease. In September,<br />\nresearchers led by Dr. Arvid E. Nilsen at the University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, determined<br />\nthat orally-administered acyclovir was effective in<br />\ncountering recurrent genital herpes, as well as initial outbreaks. Until now, the only genuine preventative medicine was abstinence, aided in some cases<br />\nby the \"prodome,\"a tingling or aching prior to a<br />\nrecurrent outbreak of herpes, which serves a warning to avoid sexual contact for a few weeks.<br />\nThough acyclovir has been approved as a treatment, no cure for herpes simplex seems in sight.<br />\nMedical research seems concerned primarily with<br />\ndetermining why herpes can be recurrent in some<br />\npeople and not in others. Says Aurelian, \"If we<br />\nunderstand what causes the virus to remain dormant<br />\nafter it enters the body, then we may have some<br />\nhope of finding a cure for those that suffer from<br />\nrecurrences. It is important to note that a recent<br />\nstudy in the May 1, 1982 edition of Science News<br />\nmagazine, had this very proposition raised. It was<br />\nsuggested that by developing a drug which might<br />\nkeep herpes viruses perpetually latent in ganglia,<br />\nrather than from periodically becoming 'active' and<br />\n'infecting,' the [recurrent] herpes sufferer might be<br />\nrestored to a normal life.\"<br />\nOf less concern is the search for something which<br />\nwould eliminate or prevent the virus. Since past efforts have produced insignificant progress in this<br />\ndirection, current research ignores the approach,<br />\nconcentrating instead on developing more effective<br />\ntreatments.<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\nJennifer Brezenoff<br />\nGillian Clark<br />\nCatherine Raeff<br />\nMichael Vardac<br />\nare generally unwilling to discuss the disease openly. SHAC hopes for more success in this direction,<br />\nand is planning to sponsor an on-campus discussion panel on herpes sometime in February.<br />\nPatients are often referred to Dr. Aurelian. She<br />\nsays that herpes is one of \"the most serious problems on campus,\" and like the health center, she<br />\nprovides the victims with accurate information and<br />\ngives them advice for their future sexual activities.<br />\nThrough all these efforts, the health center is<br />\nseriously trying to control the Hopkins herpes situation. But despite their efforts, Rehner feels that the<br />\nspread of the disease will continue at its current rate<br />\nin the future.<br />\nHelen Phrash, manager of the Venereal Diseases<br />\nClinic of the Planned Parenthood Organization of<br />\nBaltimore, claims that the media has created the<br />\nrumor regarding the resurgence of herpes. The increase in reported herpes cases in the past twenty<br />\nyears should have been expected.<br />\n\"People are having sex more often and with more<br />\npartners,\" [thrash says, \"therefore, they are more<br />\n<br />\n\fprone to infection.\" Then there might be no true<br />\nherpes epidemic. In fact, attending college in<br />\nBaltimore might mislead one into surmising that<br />\nherpes and smallpox appear with the same<br />\nfrequency.<br />\nThe Goucher College Student Infirmary reports<br />\nthat while there have been reported a few cases of<br />\nherpes on campus, it is not a serious problem; in<br />\nfact we were told that it was a rare occurence. A<br />\nsexuality course is offered on campus in which communicable diseases are covered, and gynecological<br />\nteaching sessions on V.D. are held. The Goucher<br />\nStudent Health Advisory Board, like the Hopkins<br />\ncounterpart SHAC, plays a role in keeping Goucher<br />\nhealthy.<br />\nNor do the young women of Notre Dame appear<br />\nto have a serious problem with Herpes. Mary L.<br />\nAkens, Director of Student Health, says, \"Incidents<br />\nare very rare.\" The majority of the students are<br />\nlegal adults, and because of this they may not<br />\nnecessarily report illness to the College Health Services, but go directly to their own physicians. Akens<br />\nstates, however,\"Cases that do come to our attention are referred primarily to private<br />\ngynecologists.\" Being a small college, herpes<br />\ncounseling and information are provided on an individual basis.<br />\nMorgan State University, a large black coed institution, has had no reported cases of herpes on<br />\ncampus. Dr. Phillips, a physician at the Campus<br />\nHealth Center, claims Morgan students are very well<br />\ninformed; in addition, many are commuters, and<br />\nmay seek health care off-campus. The infirmary<br />\nruns a health awareness group that educates<br />\n<br />\nSUSCEPTIBLE<br />\n0 HOST<br />\n1111 no cinti bod 'les<br />\n<br />\nPRIMARY<br />\nNIFECTION<br />\n<br />\nrecurrent man ces to tions<br />\n<br />\nfeqer blisicrs<br />\n.3e.n<br />\n<br />\n\\ herpes<br />\necephatt s<br />\nherpat,c wh,t1o,,.4<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\ndendritic cornea 1 ulots<br />\n<br />\nSU I1CLINICAL<br />\nINFECTION<br />\nno 41s It* diseAse<br />\n<br />\neXci4antS, Such a 5<br />\nD<br />\n<br />\nclin;Cal aiSeqw,<br />\ntraumciiic herpeS<br />\n<br />\nhtrpat c<br />\n<br />\nCARRIER<br />\n<br />\nlo<br />\n<br />\n-44er<br />\ntrournq<br />\nsonShinc<br />\nmenstruation<br />\nps\\ichic vpse-t5<br />\ncrstrointe5+inaI upsets<br />\n(ankiboeS and, qirus per s ist)<br />\n<br />\nNJUIN/0\\14%inii-i9<br />\n<br />\nmen,ny tnce,phaii-ti<br />\nkera to On:lunct<br />\nti S<br />\neClewt\u2018 hcr pie icu<br />\nyrieralcz.ed, cutancous her e3<br />\nfrom<br />\n<br />\nPermo-i-o10 .<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nin Generckl Meskic;i1s,<br />\n(McGraw - Hi<br />\n<br />\n1919)<br />\n<br />\nAnother Look<br />\n<br />\n#<br />\n<br />\nstudents on sexual matters.<br />\nComparatively, Towson State, larger than<br />\nHopkins, Goucher and Morgan, has a correspondingly incidence of reported herpes cases. However,<br />\nactual figures can not be obtained because the Student Health Clinic refers any student suspected of<br />\ncontracting herpes to the Baltimore Planned Parenthood clinic.<br />\nHelen Phrash claims that for college students<br />\nsuspected of having herpes, very few of their suspit ions are worthwhile. The figures representing redblooded American college students between the ages<br />\nof 18 and 24 are quite encouraging. In one<br />\nyear,1977, Baltimore students were given initial exams. Out of these, only 37 were suspected of having herpes, and from those 37 students very few actually had the disease.<br />\nThe figures reported by Phrash however could<br />\nbe misleading and limited. Mr. L. T. Stewart, from<br />\nthe V.D. Control Division of the Baltimore County Department of Health, says informative figures<br />\nare difficult to obtain because herpes is not a reportable disease like gonorrhea and syphilis. \"Unlike<br />\nthe two common venereal diseases, herpes carriers<br />\nare not required to report the incidence of the<br />\ndisease to the health departments.\" The department<br />\ncan offer no cure or treatment; only counseling is<br />\ngiven. Patients are seen on a fairly regular basis and<br />\nthe department does receive a number of calls from<br />\npeople requesting information. Contrary to<br />\nPhrash's figures and observations, Stewart claims,<br />\n\"We're seeing a lot of it.\" He considers herpes a<br />\nsignificant problem in Baltimore County.<br />\nBill Palm, principal educator with the Sexually<br />\nTransmitted Diseases Program of the Baltimore City Department of Health, was much less optimistic<br />\nthan Phrash. Although his figures are not completely accurate, he considers them close estimates. Palm<br />\nguesses that Baltimore sees 2000 new cases of herpes<br />\neach year. Getting to bare facts: the clinics reported<br />\n917 cases of herpes last year, more than half of them<br />\nblack males. Though Johns Hopkins Hospital and<br />\nprivate physicians also reported a small number of<br />\ncases, predominantly white females, Palm calls it<br />\nan \"equal opportunity disease.\"<br />\nPalm explains, \"Contracting herpes would be<br />\nmore of a nuisance, a worry, to an affluent person.<br />\nBut if you are black and poor it is really not a priority. There are other things to worry about. Then the<br />\ndisease would go unreported.\" The age range runs<br />\nfrom adolescence to middle age, yet there is a<br />\npreponderance in sexually-active individuals in their<br />\ntwenties.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n111,*'4 .,.

Many private physicians<br />\nhave difficulty recognizing herpes. \"The chief difficulty today in identifying the herpes simplex,\"<br />\nbelieves Dr. John Skouge, another Hopkins hospital<br />\nresearcher, \"lies largely in the education of most<br />\ndoctors conducting such examinations. Often the<br />\ntraining of general practitioners is not sufficient in<br />\nthis area, and this leads to the virus being identified<br />\nas something else in some cases. Moreover, there<br />\nare very few laboratories at present which maintain<br />\nthe proper techniques for accurate detection.\"<br />\nThis lack of knowledge on the part of doctors is<br />\na cause for worry. It herpes is suspected, Bill Palm<br />\nsuggests \"you might want to see a dermatologist<br />\nrather than a gynecologist. Herpes is an infection<br />\nof the skin and dermatologists are better informed<br />\non the subject.\"<br />\nFollowing treatment, many might worry, that<br />\nherpes, particularly recurrent strains, would have<br />\na stifling effect on one's lifestyle. Skouge assures,<br />\nhowever, that sex after herpes is possible. In order<br />\nto prevent the transmission of the virus to one's<br />\nfuture partners, he suggests,\"A few important considerations must be borne in mind. The herpes<br />\nsimplex is a disease which recurs at periodic intervals. The virus may lie dormant within an individual<br />\nfor months, up to a year, at a time. What must be<br />\nunderstood by those affected by the disease, is that<br />\nat the first sign of an infection, i.e. tingling or itching sensation in the mouth or genital areas [the<br />\nprodome], the person must break Off from having<br />\n<br />\nany sexual'contact with another individual. This is<br />\ncrucial since the virus can be easily transferred to<br />\nanother during this period of relapse, which may<br />\nlast from seven to ten days. With these episodes of<br />\nrecurrence happening once or twice a year, an afflicted person may carefully plan his or her sexual<br />\nhabits to avoid any fear of passing on the disease.<br />\nIn this manner, an individual could conceivably<br />\nbecome married, have children, and never endanger<br />\nhis or her immediate family by exercising prudence.<br />\nThis is often the case.\"<br />\nLastly, how can herpes be avoided by an<br />\nuninfected party? Well, awareness and caution in<br />\nthis sexually active age are still essential. The following are Helen Phrash's basic steps to follow to stay<br />\nyoung, pretty and herpes free:<br />\nIt is to the woman's advantage to keep her own sup<br />\nply of condoms.<br />\nIt is unwise to carry condoms in a wallet or<br />\nanywhere else close to the body.(The heat causes<br />\nthem to lose their effectiveness.)<br />\nContrary to popular belief, it's still safe to sit down<br />\nwhen you use public bathrooms. Herpes can only<br />\nbe contracted from the toilet seat if you are having<br />\nsex on it.<br />\nThose who do have herpes simplex should act with<br />\ncaution. For example, never touch a cold sore on<br />\nthe mouth and then touch the genital area. Simplex<br />\n1 can very well transform into simplex 2, and viceversa.<br />\nAgain, it must be stressed that the only sure way<br />\nto prevent contracting herpes simplex is through<br />\nabstinence. Though much remains to be learned<br />\nabout the virus, with further advances in the<br />\nmedical and psychological treatment of the<br />\ndisease,and further education of the public in<br />\ngeneral, the catastrophic aura now surrounding<br />\nherpes may be dispelled.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12/OCTOBER /9, 1982<br />\n<br />\nTWO GRAND<br />\nA PRIZE WINNERS<br />\nII WILL BE<br />\nWitaiiiiiiiati<br />\nSCHUTZ'S GUESTS<br />\nIN TORONTO<br />\n/ FOR THE LAST<br />\nPERFORMANCE OF<br />\nTHE WHO'S 1982<br />\nNORTH AMERICAN TOUR.<br />\n<br />\n41141111111111117<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nThis may be your last chance to see in<br />\nperson one of the world's great rock<br />\nlegends.

But you may not know that<br />\nChester's Place has prompted a spinoff: Chester's Concert Series.<br />\nLike Chester's Place, the series is<br />\nfunded by the Office of the Chaplain,<br />\nwith the proceeds going to the Hopkins<br />\nTutorial Project. The series is comprised of Friday or Saturday night concerts<br />\nby popular local bands, usually taking<br />\nplace in the Great Hall. The music<br />\nranges from rock to reggae, from<br />\noriginal material to cover versions of<br />\nother artists' songs.<br />\nThe man in charge of the Series is<br />\nHopkins alumnus Dave Fishkin (Class<br />\nof '76). It is Fishkin who, with the help<br />\nof four Hopkins work/study students,<br />\nbooks the bands and runs the events. He<br />\nis not a newcomer to the Chaplain's Office; for three years, he was the director of the Tutorial Project. Currently a<br />\n<br />\nlawyer in private practice, Fishkin still for the Tutorial Project, and Fishkin<br />\nfinds the time to promote various fund- hopes to be as successful with the new<br />\nraisin activities for the Chaplain's Of- series. So far, though, the concerts have<br />\nnot been drawing as many people as had<br />\nbeen expected. For the most part, each<br />\nconcert has been attracting about 60 or<br />\n70 people. Fishkin says,\"We could easily double that. We need at least one hundred to make it work.\"<br />\nThe concerts are open to the general<br />\npublic, which Fishkin sees as very<br />\npositive, but he also believes that \"the<br />\nsuccess of the series depends on the support of Hopkins students. We very<br />\n.much want Hopkins students. The concerts are very much for the students<br />\nhere, although we have a wide variety<br />\nof people who come.\" And if this series<br />\nis successful, there may be a second one<br />\nimplemented next spring.<br />\nAccording to Fishkin, the two main<br />\ngoals of the series are to raise money for<br />\n.the Tutorial Project and to improve the<br />\nsive Ir ishkin, of Chester's<br />\nsocial life at Hopkins by providing a<br />\n\u2022fice. The October 17 Michael Hedges campus activity that \"the students enconcert Fishkin organized raised $300 joy doing.\"<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nAdmission is $2.50, but as an incentive for the Hopkins student body, discount coupons for the series will be placed in campus mailboxes some time this<br />\nweek. \"Buy one drink, get one free\"<br />\ncoupons can also be found in the<br />\n\"Moneymania\" booklets distributed at<br />\nthe start of the semester. Draught beer<br />\nand fruit juices are available at each<br />\nconcert. Those under 18 are welcome;<br />\nhowever, IDs are checked at the bar.<br />\nUpcoming concerts include a<br />\nNovember 6 Glass Pavilion concert by<br />\nUsed Parts; the Reactors in the Great<br />\nHall on November 13; and, also in the<br />\nGreat Hall, Hopkins' own Rose Colored<br />\nHugh on November 19. The Reactors<br />\nand Rose Colored Hugh have strong<br />\nlocal followings, while Used Parts is<br />\ndescribed by Fishkin as \"a fun dance<br />\nband.\"<br />\nBut still the question remains: will<br />\nHopkins students support the Concert<br />\nSeries? Fishkin states his case plainly:<br />\n\"There's just no reason why they<br />\nshouldn't come.\"<br />\n<br />\ns<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14/OCTOBER 29, 1982<br />\n<br />\nHam on Wry<br />\n<br />\nAmazing Folks, Amazing Feats<br />\n<br />\nBY MIKE KUN<br />\n<br />\nThough I complain about it a lot, my life has<br />\nbeen pretty exciting. I have met some of the most<br />\ninteresting people in the world and have been present to witness some of the most fascinating events<br />\nin history. The following are brief summaries of<br />\nsome of the most incredible events ever encountered.

Last year, the team<br />\nwas 11-3 in intercollegiate dual<br />\nmeets (5-1 in conference play)<br />\nand captured second place in<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nChampionship for the second<br />\nstraight year. It's fencing, and<br />\nit's heading for another potentially successful year under the<br />\ndirectjon of Coach Dick Oles.<br />\nBlue Jay fencing has traditionally had an excellent record.<br />\nStill,<br />\nlast<br />\nyear's<br />\naccomplishments were considered<br />\nonly \"a notch above the bare<br />\nminimum,\" according to<br />\nCoach Oles, despite individual<br />\nperformances leading to the<br />\nepee and sabre trophies from<br />\nthe MACFA championship<br />\ntournament, and Roger<br />\nBlauvelt's conference championship in epee.<br />\nEven though the conference<br />\nseason does not commence for<br />\nanother two to three months,<br />\nofficial varsity practices have<br />\nalready begun, and the team<br />\n\u2022 has fenced in a couple of<br />\nUnited States Fencing Association (USFA) tournaments. As<br />\nfor predictions for this year's<br />\nsixteen<br />\nman varistv squad,<br />\n\"It's too early to say,\" according to foil captain John Tu.<br />\nCoach Oles agrees \"I don't<br />\nreally know...our schedule is<br />\nnot complete yet.\" Also, the<br />\nepee and sabre lineups are not<br />\nset yet, after the loss of three of<br />\nlast year's starters who had<br />\nbeen expected to return. All of<br />\nthe foils, on the other hand, are<br />\nback, with the addition of Andy Goldberg, a talented<br />\nfreshman fencer coming out of<br />\nLong Island; the foil team<br />\nlooks very strong indeed.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, there is a tremendous emphasis on rebuilding<br />\nthe team, since a majority of<br />\nlast year's starters have either<br />\ngraduated or left the team. A<br />\nsignificant aspect to this<br />\n<br />\nfact, the epee and sabre cap- the unitorms ot this remarkable<br />\ntains, Roger Blauvelt and Taro team are students, most of<br />\nAdachi, respectively, are both whom (about 95 percent) have<br />\nnever fenced before coming to<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nThe upcoming season, then, Hopkins.

The<br />\nteam played strong defense,<br />\nand the offense had the opportunities, but could not complete<br />\nthe plays. A good one by F&M<br />\nmidway through the second<br />\nhalf gave them the victory.<br />\n<br />\nThe Widener game was a<br />\nvery frustrating one for the<br />\nHopkins squad. While the<br />\nstatistics were fairly close, the<br />\ngame was in actuality dominated by Widener, as their<br />\ndefense shut down the Hopkins<br />\noffense at every opportunity.<br />\nTonight, the team is home<br />\nagainst Washington College,<br />\nand next Tuesday they host<br />\nGettysburg in the final regular<br />\nseason game.

Haverford was one of the strongest<br />\nopponents the Jays have played<br />\n\u2014they were quick, with good<br />\nball control, and hard hitting.<br />\nBut the Jays gave them a<br />\nmatch, beating them 1-0. The<br />\ngoal, however, did not come<br />\nuntil the last ten minutes of the<br />\nsecond half, after an hour of<br />\nhard, back-and-forth play. Jennifer O'Connor scored the goal<br />\noff a pass from Sharon Horvath. The Jays tried for a second goal on a hard drive in the<br />\nlast few minutes, but time<br />\nquickly ran out. Martha Gottling made some beautiful plays,<br />\nespecially with her stick work<br />\non one-on-ones. Right wing<br />\nJudy Schmidt used her ball control skills to advantage on the<br />\nboundary line\u2014no one could<br />\nget the ball away from her<br />\n<br />\nwithout sending it out of<br />\nbounds.

Also, it<br />\nseems that a few balls did go into the goal cage, yet they came<br />\nback out quickly and the<br />\nreferees did not see them.<br />\nAgain, the Jays exhibited their<br />\nusual good stick work and team<br />\nconsideration, but were unable<br />\nto score.<br />\nThe hackers' record now<br />\nstands at 4-6-1.

Japanese and<br />\nKorean language programs may<br />\nbe developed, as well as a<br />\ncourse in Far Eastern History,<br />\nand if all goes well, Hopkins<br />\nmay have a Far Eastern Studies<br />\ndepartment in a few years.<br />\nSuccess, however, is dependent upon student interest. For<br />\nthis reason, the Chinese<br />\nStudents' Association has put<br />\ntogether a questionnaire to<br />\ndetermine interest in this program, and it should be in<br />\nstudents' mailboxes within a<br />\nweek or so. Read it carefully. A<br />\nFar Eastern Studies program<br />\nhas many facets, and many<br />\nstudents should be interested in<br />\none or more.

Kwok<br />\n<br />\nTime For Real Issues<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the News-Letter of<br />\n10/15/82, a quote was ascribed to me concerning the SAC<br />\nfreezing of Student Council<br />\nfunds. I would like to clarify<br />\nmy position to dissipate any<br />\nfalse impressions anyone may<br />\nhave drawn from the quote.<br />\nTo begin, I would like to affirm that I could not, and did<br />\nnot represent the SAC at the<br />\n10/13/82 Student Council<br />\nmeeting or anytime since the<br />\nend of my term as SAC<br />\nsecretary.

Perhaps the PSU<br />\norganizers were not aware of<br />\nthe Coalition's plans, or were<br />\nnot able to control their actions<br />\nonce the event began. But surely the PSU, with its relatively<br />\nsmall membership, was expecting help from the Coalition to<br />\npolice the large audience long<br />\nbefore they became occupied<br />\nwith the outside protesters. In<br />\nany case, by bringing in outside<br />\nforces for security, the PSU is<br />\naccountable for the Coalition's<br />\nactions and for their own illpreparedness to handle a potentially risky situation.<br />\n2. In regards to the second<br />\nstudent who was ejected, he<br />\nwas not, as your reporter<br />\nstated, \"escorted\" out.

The severely limited<br />\ndiscussion and the security tactics of throwing out dissenters<br />\nturned the program into a rally<br />\nfor the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to preach its<br />\nvicious anti-Israel rhetoric. The<br />\nPSU should be dechartered<br />\nsolely for the terrible way in<br />\nwhich security was handled.<br />\nHowever, the program itself<br />\nshould not have ben allowed by<br />\nthe University in the first place.<br />\nThe PLO is a terrorist group,<br />\nresponsible for the deaths of<br />\nthousands of innocent men,<br />\nwomen and children. The PLO<br />\nhas planted bombs in school<br />\nbuildings, has carried out<br />\nnumerous bloody airplane hijackings (e.g., Entebbe, 1976),<br />\nhas gunned down unarmed<br />\ncivilians, both in Israel and<br />\nthroughout the world (e.g. the<br />\nMunich Olympics, 1972), and<br />\nhas murdered moderate Palestinian leaders who were willing to<br />\ndiscuss peace with Israel. And<br />\nthe PLO repeatedly vows to liquidate Israel, to push the Jews<br />\ninto the sea.<br />\nIn the light of all this, a PLO<br />\nspokesman was invited to speak<br />\non campus, with the approval<br />\nof the Hopkins Administration.<br />\nIt's time for the University to<br />\nissue a policy banning hate<br />\ngroups and terrorist groups<br />\nfrom speaking on campus. Notwithstanding the right to free<br />\nspeech, the University is not<br />\nobligated to provide a forum<br />\nfor such groups. Is providing<br />\nthis type of forum in the best<br />\ninterests of Hopkins students?<br />\nAlso, what image does Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nwant to project to the academic<br />\ncommunity, and to the<br />\nBaltimore community?<br />\nThe absence of an Administration ban opens up the<br />\nUniversity to any number of<br />\norganizations preaching hate<br />\nand violence.

In view of<br />\ncurrent Administration policy,<br />\nnot to allow them to speak here<br />\nwould be hypocrisy on the part<br />\nof all those (including the<br />\nNews-Letter) who claimed that<br />\nnot allowing the PLO to speak<br />\nhere would be a violation of<br />\ntheir right to free speech.<br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRobert Morrison<br />\nAline Hutner<br />\nSander Smith<br />\n<br />\nRe: Moran's Op-ed<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nDoreen, you're a gem.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br />\n<br />\nCOLLEGE ENGINEERS<br />\n,<br />\nvias's,)'<br />\no400<br />\n4,Ax.w,0<br />\n0O.<br />\ns<br />\nLa k\u00b0<br />\n\u201e,<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA few points of clarification in<br />\nregards to your coverage of last<br />\nweek's PSU Teach-In:<br />\nI.

The loyal Hopkins contingent, bearing the brunt of the<br />\nwinter-like winds, watched<br />\npleasingly as Coach Pfeifer lead<br />\nhis troops to a 24-7 pounding of<br />\nthe Lebanon Valley Dutchmen.<br />\nThe game was never very<br />\nclose. Hopkins accumulated an<br />\ninsurmountable 24-0 score,<br />\nbefore the Dutchmen finally<br />\nthreatened at the 4:08 mark in<br />\nthe fourth quarter with a two-<br />\n<br />\nyard touchdown run, capping a<br />\n38-yard drive.<br />\nThe Jay's defense was<br />\ntenacious\u2014allowing Lebanon<br />\nValley a mere 30 yards rushing<br />\nand 108 yards in the air. Jay<br />\nSmith had a big day at the outside linebacker spot, with an interception, a fumble recovery<br />\nand a fistful of tackles and<br />\nsacks. Jeff Kendall, Hopkin's<br />\nflamboyant defensive back,<br />\nalso chipped in with an aerial<br />\ntheft, as fellow teammates Fran<br />\nMuller, Mark Abbadichio and<br />\nDave Schroeder also put in<br />\noutstanding performances.<br />\nThe real story was the Blue<br />\n<br />\nJay offense. A pre-game question mark hung in the air concerning the Hopkins running<br />\ngame, with leading groundgainer Brad McLam out with a<br />\n<br />\ntouchdown with 12:40 left in<br />\nthe second half on a two-yard<br />\nplunge. The Jays gained a total<br />\nof 236 yards on the ground for<br />\nthe da .<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays were hitting hard last Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nCardwell each caught three<br />\npasses and Cardwell made a<br />\nsensational 30-yard diving catch<br />\nin the early minutes of the<br />\nfourth quarter to keep another<br />\nBlue Jay drive alive. Ken<br />\nLoeber was on the receiving end<br />\nof a Mark Campbell 10-yard<br />\ntouchdown pass at the 9:41<br />\nmark in the fourth quarter to<br />\nmake the Hopkins lead 24-0,<br />\nthe Jays accumulated 102 yards<br />\nin the air, for a net total of 338<br />\nyards gained against Lebanon<br />\nValley.<br />\nHopkins' overall record now<br />\nis 2-4.

Held in<br />\nShriver Hall, the third program<br />\nof this year's MSE Symposium<br />\ndrew approximately 200 people, roughly half of whom were<br />\nHopkins students. The discussion revolved around a<br />\nhypothetical situation Friendly<br />\nproposed: the dilemma of a<br />\nnewspaper reporter when he<br />\nlearns of a fabulous story which<br />\nposes a hazard to national<br />\nsecurity. The ethical and legal<br />\naspects of this and other situations, both real and fictitious,<br />\nwere discussed by the panel and<br />\nalso by members of the audience, as Friendly sought audience participation.<br />\nThe panel consisted of:<br />\nJoseph Sterne, editorial page<br />\neditor of the Baltimore Sun;<br />\nMichael J. Kelly, dean ot the<br />\nUniversity of Maryland School<br />\nof Law; Lyle Denniston,<br />\nSupreme Court correspondent<br />\nfor the Baltimore Sun; Douglas<br />\nFellman, JHU Student Council<br />\npresident; Andrew Hurley,<br />\neditor of The Hopkins NewsLetter; and Robin Johnson,<br />\nstaff member for the NewsLetter. Friendly is Edward R.<br />\nMurrow professor emeritus of<br />\nbroadcast journalism of Columbia University Graduate<br />\nSchool of Journalism.<br />\nBefore beginning, Friendly<br />\nasked the audience to move forward to promote unity between<br />\naudience and panel.

She also said that<br />\nthe security problems were the<br />\nfault of the JSA, because they<br />\nhad entered Levering Hall<br />\nagainst University regulations.<br />\nThamer said the problem with<br />\nthe Speaker Committee had<br />\noccurred only once, and arose<br />\nout of ignorance on the part of<br />\nthe PSU. As to the charge of a<br />\nclosed meeting, she said that the<br />\nstudent in question was invited<br />\nto join the meeting; he refused<br />\nand was asked to leave the<br />\nroom because the PSU was<br />\ndiscussing a very confidential<br />\nmatter.

The parents of one<br />\nof the, children involved<br />\nreported that their son had been<br />\nsexually abused by an Adam<br />\nEvans. Upon further investiga-<br /><br />\nLion, it was found that the<br />\nman's real name was Christopher Edmonds and that he<br />\nhad had relations with several<br />\nyouths, aged twelve to fourteen.

They did so by acting<br />\nin the capacity of a \"big<br />\nbrother\" to groups of the<br />\nyouths. Later, they were able to<br />\npersuade the boys to submit to<br />\ncertain activities, including<br />\nfellatio, and to be paid for it.<br />\nThis incident appears to be<br />\nan isolated one out of many.

Friendly then asked Denniston if his<br />\nactions would be altered if the<br />\nSupreme Court imposed a<br />\nTemporary Restraining Order<br />\non the paper and threatened to<br />\njail him if he disobeyed it. Denpiston replied that he would still<br />\npublish the story because he felt<br />\nthat, in his own mind, running<br />\nthe story is what he ought to<br />\ndo. He maintained that he<br />\nwould \"sit in jail until I rot\"<br />\nrather than withhold the story<br />\nfrom print.

He said he<br />\nbelieved the committee could<br />\nhave 1000 signatures by Monday. Because of this overwhelming student support,<br />\nCampbell said he felt the council should take action on the<br />\nmatter.<br />\nTwo different motions were<br />\npassed, both proposed by<br />\nDarlene Marshall. The first<br />\nstated only that the council<br />\nwished \"to voice its protest<br />\nagainst the Ku Klux Klan and<br />\nthe racist views they represent,<br />\nbecause of the overwhelming<br />\nresponse of the student body<br />\nagainst the Klan.\" The second<br />\nmotion stated that \"We, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University Student Council, support the antiKlan rally...because of the<br />\noverwhelming response of the<br /><br />\nstudent body against the Klan.\"<br />\nBefore either motion passed,<br />\nCouncil Treasurer Harry Davis<br />\nattempted to introduce a<br />\nsubstitute motion banning the<br />\ncouncil from taking any future<br />\nstands on \"national and international public policy.\" When<br />\nDavis tried to introduce his motion as a substitute for Marshall's, he was ruled out of<br />\norder by Council President<br />\nDoug Fellman.<br /><br />\nwhether or not we were going<br />\nto debate it.\"<br />\nThroughout the meeting,<br />\nDavis had strongly opposed the<br />\ncouncil taking a stand on the<br />\nKlan issue. \"The council is not<br />\na political body,\" he said,<br /><br />\nDavis, therefore, reintroduced his motion after Marshall's<br />\nhad passed. The vote of the<br />\ncouncil was a tie, allowing<br />\nFellman to vote. He voted no,<br />\nkilling the motion. After tile<br />\nmeeting, Fellman stated he was<br />\nopposed to the council's taking<br />\na stand on political issues, but<br />\nthat he killed Davis' motion<br />\nbecause \"under Harry's motion, if a political issue ever<br />\ncame to the council, we would<br />\nspend two hours debating<br /><br />\ntative Tim Gilbreath disagreed,<br />\nhowever. \"I think we misrepresent the students and do a<br />\ndisservice to the students by ignoring issues they have chosen<br />\nto make a part of their lives,\"<br />\nhe said.<br /><br />\nCommittee Recommends New<br />\nLibrary For Dorm Dining Hall<br />\nBY ETHAN RARICK<br /><br />\nChris Campbell argues against KKK.<br /><br />\nalthough he stressed that he was<br />\nopposed to the Klan and that he<br />\nhad signed the petition. \"I<br />\nthink it would be absolutely<br />\nwrong if the council moved on<br />\nthis.\"<br />\nSophomore Class Represen-<br /><br />\nProvost Richard Longaker<br />\nhas appointed a committee of<br />\nfaculty members, administrators and students to consider<br />\nThe possibility of using the dining facilities in the old dorms as<br />\na library.

This will<br />\nlikewise be true in 1982.<br />\nFuthermore, there are trends which<br />\ntake place in elections and these trends<br />\nare not to be ignored. In every election<br />\nin the 20th century, the party which has<br />\ncontrolled the White House has lost<br />\nseats in the following election with the<br />\nsingle exception of 1934. Instead of this<br />\nbeing a peculiar phenomenon, current<br />\n. thought in political science reveals an explanation. It is generally agreed that the<br />\nelectorate in off-term elections is<br />\nsignificantly indifferent to that of<br />\npresidential elections when about 80 percent more people go to the polls. It is<br />\nbelieved that a larger percentage of those<br />\nturning out to vote on midterm elections<br />\nare doing so in order to vote against the<br />\nparty which happens to be in power.<br />\nThus, if the Republicans lose seats up<br />\nto a certain point, it simply cannot be<br />\nseen as a defeat of the policies of President Reagan.<br /><br />\nWhat this delimits, then, is the question which is most thoroughly debated.<br />\nDuring the first midterm election for a<br />\nparty in power, the average number of<br />\nseats lost is 12. Further, the average<br />\nnumber lost since 1952 has also been 12;<br />\nrecently Nixon lost 12 and Carter lost<br />\n15. Therefore, if one is looking for signs<br />\nthe failure or success of Reagan, this is<br />\nthe number to look for.<br />\nBut this is not to say that if Reagan<br />\nloses 13 seats that his program is rejected<br />\nby the country as a whole. Clearly, this<br />\nwould be ludicrous when one is looking<br />\nat the results of 435 individual contests.<br />\nFurthermore, Senate and gubernatorial<br />\nraces are not considered to be an accurate indication of a president's success<br />\nbecause of the peculiarities which exist<br />\nin each particular case. Therefore, while<br />\nit is correct to look for signs of success<br />\nor failure of the Reagan agenda in the<br />\nHouse races, it is not clear what the<br />\nvarious numbers will mean. If Reagan<br />\nloses fewer than 13 seats, it is certainly<br />\na victory (moral at least) for the<br />\nRepublicans. If the Republicans lose<br />\nmore than 25 or so, the picture is murky,<br />\nand one's interpretations will undoubtedly rest on one's party affiliation.<br />\nIn particular, however, there are a<br />\nnumber of fascinating races which will<br />\nbe intensely watched across the nation.<br />\nClose races in which the Republicans, I<br />\nbelieve, have the upper hand are Pete<br />\nWilson over Jerry Brown for Senate in<br />\nCalifornia; Lowell Weiker in Connecticut; Millicent Fenwick in New Jersey;<br />\nJim Thompson for governor or Adlai<br />\nStevenson II in Illinois. Also, likely<br />\nRepublican gains are to be found in the<br />\nSenate race in Virginia, a gain of House<br />\nseats in Florida, North Carolina,<br />\nArizona, Utah, Colorado, Texas,<br />\nOregon and Washington. Most<br />\nDemocratic gains will come from governor positions, particularly in Michigan,<br />\nWisconsin, Ohio and Arkansas. While<br />\nhate to predict Republican Senate<br />\nlosses, close races are to be found in<br />\nNew Mexico, Missouri and Minnesota.<br />\nAnd in Maryland, well, at least the<br />\nRepublicans won't be any worse off<br />\nthan they presently are. We wish Pascal<br />\nand Hogan well, but if they can break<br />\nthrough the 40 percent mark they will<br />\nbe doing well.<br />\nOverall then, I believe we are looking<br />\nin the area of seven Democratic gains in<br />\nthe gubernatorial contests, a washout in<br />\nthe Senate, and a gain of only about 15<br />\nseats in the House. This will not be a<br />\nyear of a Republican debacle.<br /><br />\nBrian Mirsky is president of the College<br />\nRepublicans.<br /><br />\nL .entut<br />\n7-I thirikIII go for<br /><br />\n+oda<br /><br />\nand<br /><br />\na walk<br /><br />\nsee Baltimore.<br /><br />\nAre you serieu.s ?!<br />\nWell, act\u201cally<br />\nroommate sad<br />\nif' I didA't get oi-it<br />\nhis ti,kt he waulci<br />\nStaf nne in a<br />\ntuna can.<br /><br />\nbutt is tVisit<br />\nExc.4se<br />\ncornpu:ter<br />\nIASffl<br />\n.,/hert ilwit yew be\u2022e euirlf<br />\nIt's Wirnpeater.<br /><br />\n(C<br /><br />\nWell, k. does it v/ork 7.w<br />\n)(Help, let me okt<br />\nDo yoiA know ic ;t \"s<br />\nI don't want t\u2022 losofF<br />\nma3n etie d;pole ;viduce4<br />\ns you.n3.<br />\nal 9 o r<br />\nreedKlotor<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n'Letter Policy<br /><br />\nLetters to the editor should<br />\nbe typed, double spaced and<br />\nnot exceed 3(X) words.

A meeting was<br />\ngoing on in the council office,<br />\nso he sat down outside, according to Mirsky. The PSU was<br />\nholding a meeting in the lobby<br />\noutside the office. Mirsky said<br />\nhe was twice asked to join the<br />\nmeeting, but declined. Later,<br />\nTreasurer<br />\nPSU<br />\nPhilip<br />\nSchmandt asked Mirsky to go<br />\ninside the council office. Mirsky said he could not because of<br />\nthe meeting going on in the office, but would ask if he could<br />\ngo in, anyway. At that point,<br />\nMirsky said Schmandt told him<br />\nto go downstairs if he could not<br />\ngo in the council office. Mirsky<br />\nfelt this was a clear violation of<br />\nthe SAC's open meeting rule.<br />\nSchmandt, who was also present at the meeting, stated that<br />\nhe had asked Mirsky to leave<br />\nbecause the PSU was about to<br />\ndiscuss a confidential matter.<br />\nThe board chose not to take<br />\naction on this issue at this time.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/PAGE-7<br /><br />\nOffering<br />\nStudent<br />\nDiscounts<br />\nWith<br />\n1.D.<br /><br />\nHAIR STUDIO<br /><br />\nWOIMAN hal<br /><br />\nAccording to Davis, a separate SAA is needed because,<br />\n\"it is not a part of the responsibilities of the SAC t.o support<br />\nsports groups.\" The SAC<br />\ndecided that it cannot support<br />\nsports groups, just like it would<br />\nnot support single-issue clubs.<br />\nDavis added that the sports<br />\ngroups cannot be supported by<br />\nthe Athletic Center due to a<br />\nlack of funds.<br />\nAthletic Center Director Bab<br />\nScott confirmed this statement,<br />\nadding that the only club supported by the Athletic Center,<br />\nthe Water Polo Club, is mostly<br />\nfinanced through funds from<br />\nthe alumni associations.<br />\nHowever, Davis sees a<br />\n\"void\" between the SAC and<br />\nAthletic Center. He feels that it<br />\nshould be filled by the creation<br />\nof a \"separate, autonomous<br />\norganization.\"<br />\nSports groups presently in<br /><br />\nthe SAC are the Karate, Sailing, Bicycle, Ski, Outdoors and<br />\nRowing clubs. Students have<br />\nalso petitioned the SAC to support Akido, Judo, Racquetball<br />\nand Bowling clubs. Davis explains that these groups cause<br />\nproblems because the SAC was<br />\ndesigned to handle clubs, not<br />\nteams. He says,\"A group that<br />\ncompetes as a team should not<br />\nbe in the SAC.\" He added that<br />\nthe sports clubs in the SAC<br />\nhave already requested funds<br />\nfor competitive purposes.<br />\nDean Colombo feels that instead of creating a separate<br />\nSAA, the SAC should reevaluate its position concerning<br />\ncompetitive groups. Colombo<br />\nsays that the reason that the<br />\nSAC was set up was to let the<br />\nstudents, rather than the Administration, decide what<br />\ngroups should be on campus.<br />\nHe feels, therefore, that all stu-<br /><br />\ndent groups should be considered. \"The SAC Executive<br />\nBoard may have to expand [its]<br />\nvision,\" says Colombo. He<br />\npoints out that none of the<br />\nsports groups that he has talked to want to be under the control of the Athletic Center; they<br />\nonly want to use its facilities.<br />\nThe Rowing Club, however,<br />\nhas already expressed an interest in becoming a varsity<br />\nteam. Colombo also points out<br />\nthat due to the tightness of<br />\nmoney, the clubs in the SAA<br />\nmay not be able to travel to<br />\ncompetitions anyway.<br />\nIt is the lack of money that<br />\nforms the basis of the issue.<br />\nDavis says that the SAC cannot<br />\nafford to pay the travel expenses of the sports groups.<br />\nNevertheless, Colombo feels<br />\nthat the SAC must decide which<br />\nindividual groups will best meet<br />\nthe needs of the students.<br /><br />\nfoR AppoiramENTs:<br />\nL 338-1126<br />\nI CAR<br /><br />\nSUBS<br />\nSANDWICHES<br />\nHOT PLATTERS<br />\nSOUPS&amp;SALADS<br /><br />\nFOR INSURANCE CALL<br /><br />\n(SheilW!Goff4<br />\nDRINKS<br />\nDESSERTS<br />\nDAILY SPECIALS<br />\nPARTY TRAYS<br />\nCARRY OUT AVAILABLE<br />\n3501 St. Paul Street (The Marylander Apts.)<br />\nOpen 7 Days a Week 7 AM -7PM<br />\n235-0444<br />\nEntrance on University Pkwy.<br /><br />\nChuck Morgan<br />\n717 Light St.<br />\n[near the Science Center]<br />\n659-6800<br /><br />\nLike a good neighbor,<br />\nState Farm is there.<br />\nState Faun Insurance Compan,es<br />\nHorne Offices Bloomington Illinois<br /><br />\nUniyerstty and 33rd St.<br />\nDaily: 10 AM -2 AM<br />\nPhone ahead 467 - 1022<br /><br />\nP<br />\ntLfac<br />\nc<br />\nig<br />\nT ER<br />\n6Z1<br /><br />\nTells All<br /><br />\nWhat's It Like Attending Medical School?<br />\nBY MICHAEL FINGERHOOD<br />\nYou're probably saying to<br />\nyourself, \"That name in the<br />\nbyline sounds familiar.

It is a rather simple process, although timeconsuming and usually quite<br />\nfrustrating to the investigator,<br />\nthe professor doing the<br />\nresearch.<br />\nThe professor first formulates an idea for a workable<br />\nproject. He gets his ideas mostly through discussion with colleagues, by raising questions<br />\nabout work he or others are<br />\npresently doing, or by reading<br />\ncurrent literature. An active..<br />\nresearcher is constantly coming<br />\ninto contact with new ideas.<br />\nOnce this is done, the professor<br />\nmust write up a proposal for<br />\nsubmission to a funding<br />\nagency.<br />\nThe proposal determines if<br />\nthe project receives funding or<br />\nnot, and for this reason, almost<br />\nas much research goes into the<br />\nproposal as goes into the<br />\nproject.<br />\nThe professor must be<br />\nfamiliar with all the work currently being done on his particular subject. This is to assure<br />\nthe agency that he knows the<br />\nbackground of the area. According to Professor Steven<br />\nStanley, of the Earth and<br />\nPlanetary Sciences Department,<br />\nit is important not to infringe<br />\nupon the research of others.<br />\nThe proposal submitted by<br />\nthe professor must convince the<br />\nreviewers, a council of peers<br />\nwho discuss the validity of the<br />\nproposal, that the scope of the<br />\nproject is large enough to be<br />\nworthwhile to the agency, yet<br />\nsmall enough to be tractable. It<br />\nis also important that the project being proposed will result<br /><br />\nin tangible data, because it's<br />\ndifficult to obtain funding for<br />\ntheoretical work.<br />\nStanley submits only one<br />\nproposal at a time, due to his<br />\ninterest in many different<br />\nfields, all requiring a full<br />\nlaboratory. It would be possible for him to submit more than<br />\none proposal if he bad access to<br />\na large lab, and if he had<br />\nassistants capable of handling<br />\nsuch variety. Unfortunately,<br />\nthe University's budget does<br />\nthis.<br />\nnot<br /><br />\nDr. Ales Nit! oft<br />\nMeanwhile, Professor Alex<br />\nNickon, of the Chemistry<br />\nDepartment, says it is quite<br />\ncommon for chemists to submit<br />\nmore than one proposal at a<br />\ntime. If the investigator is<br />\nresearching various topics<br />\nwithin one subject, he will submit all the projects under one<br />\nproposal. If the topics,<br />\nhowever, are all in different<br />\nareas, he will submit one proposal for each project, often<br />\nsubmitting one to an agency.<br />\nMost of the projects are<br />\nongoing, thus requiring<br />\nrenewable grants. These grants<br />\nusually come up for revision<br />\nonce during a five-year period.<br />\nProfessor Patrick Moran, of<br />\nthe Material Science Department, says most of his projects<br /><br />\nHAIR UNLIMITED<br />\n3120 Saint Paul Street<br />\n235-0741<br /><br />\nIf your hairisn't becoming to you'<br />\nYou should be coming to us.<br />\nColoring<br />\nPermanents<br />\nStyling<br />\n40.00 OFF WITH BARBRA<br />\nWITH THIS AD ONLY<br />\nOpen Monday through Saturday 10-6<br />\nCutting<br /><br />\ndwPREPARE FOR<br /><br />\nMCAT\u2022LSAT\u2022GMAT<br />\nSAT\u2022DAT\u2022GRE \u2022CPA<br />\nto make up missed<br />\n\u2022 Permanent Centers open days, \u2022 Opportunity<br />\nlessons.<br />\nevenings end weekends.<br />\nhome-study materials<br />\n\u2022 Low hourly cost Dedicated full- \u2022 Voluminous<br />\nconstantly updated by researchtime stiff.<br />\nIn their field.<br />\nexpert<br />\ners<br />\nfacilities<br />\nTIST-a-TAPEso<br />\n\u2022 Complete<br />\nto transfer to and<br />\nfor review of class lessons and \u2022 Opportunity<br />\nat any ot our<br />\nstudy<br />\ncontinue<br />\nmaterials.<br />\nsupplenseetarr<br />\ncenters.<br />\n80<br />\nover<br />\n\u2022 Small classes taught by skilled<br />\nInstructors.<br />\nOTHER COURSES AVAILABLE<br /><br />\nGRE PSYCH \u2022 GRE BIO \u2022 MAT \u2022 PCAT \u2022 OCAT \u2022 VAT<br />\nTOEFL \u2022 NMB \u2022 VQE \u2022 ECFMG \u2022 FLEX \u2022 NOB \u2022 N\u00c9E<br />\nCall Days.

Professor J.C.<br />\nWalker, of the Physics Department, operates over the same<br />\nlength of time, hoping to get<br />\nmost of his work done in the<br />\nfirst two years of a three-year<br />\ngrant. This is to increase the<br />\nprobability of a renewal of the<br />\ngrant.<br />\nNickon says projects are<br />\nrarely tied up. Part of the project can be completed, but there<br />\nis no final solution. The project<br />\ncontinues, though, often with a<br />\nchange in emphasis. Professor<br />\nSaul Roseman of the Biology<br />\nDepartment agrees, sayini that<br />\nprojects usually do not continue<br />\nindefinitely. The more answers<br />\nfound, the more questions are<br />\nraised.<br />\nStanley, however, usually<br />\nfinishes his work within two<br />\nyears, and he has not yet received a renewal to continue his<br />\nwork beyond the original time<br />\nof the grant.<br />\nDr. David Olton, of<br />\nPsychology, says projects<br />\nusually continue as long as<br />\nthere is money, and that there<br />\nare some short-term projects of<br />\nabout six months, though some<br />\ncan continue for 10-20 years.<br />\nMost of the professors conducting research also teach<br />\nclasses, so they usually serve as<br />\nadvisors in their research. Therefore, they rely mostly on<br />\ngraduate students, with perhaps<br />\nsome undergraduates and postdoctoral research technicians,<br />\ndepending on the extent of the<br />\nproject.<br />\nMost of the professors do<br />\ntheir research without constant<br />\ncollaboration with other colleagues. Group work, though,<br />\nis often necessary to obtain the<br />\nbest results. Some collaboration<br />\nis also done with faculty from<br />\nother institutions, especially if<br />\nthose professors have access to<br />\nequipment not available at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe majority of the proposals are sent to the National<br />\nFoundation, a<br />\nScience<br />\nsomewhat smaller amount to<br />\nthe National Institute of<br />\nHealth, and a smattering to<br />\nvarious other agencies, such as<br />\nthe Department of Defense,<br />\nthe U.S. Army and National<br />\nGeographic.<br />\nAccording to Olton, a proposal is sent anywhere and<br />\neverywhere, depending, of<br />\ncourse, on whether the agency<br />\nhas a tendency to fund such<br />\nproposals.<br />\nThough some of the professors have not yet had a proposal not funded, others have<br /><br />\nhad this happen \"often their academic salary is for nine<br />\nenough,\" according to Olton, months of the year.

An increased number of subdivisions<br />\nwould help investigators in<br />\nstructuring their proposals.<br />\nThe delay time between submitting the propsal and receiving the grant ranges from six to<br />\neighteen months.<br />\nAccording to Olton, suitable<br />\ngrants are not always received<br />\nto cover all the needs of the<br />\nresearch. This problem is solved in several ways. Walker<br />\noften arranges collaborations<br />\nwith people in other institutions. He works with some people in Germany because they<br />\nhave instruments which are better than the \"outdated\" ones at<br />\nHopkins. He also has to cut<br />\nback on how much pay goes to<br />\nassistants and how much equipment is bought.<br />\nNickon says that research<br />\nwith a smaller grant proceeds<br />\nnoticeably slower because the<br />\nnumber of assistants has to be<br />\ncut back. He often has to<br />\nredirect his emphasis towards a<br />\ndifferent goal and do the best<br />\nhe can with what is given.<br />\nAccording to Roseman,<br />\neesearchers must suffer and<br />\nstruggle. Low funding is a major problem because funding is<br />\nso hard to get.<br />\nThe University acts as a<br />\nfinancial agent. It is given the<br />\nmoney offered by the grant in<br />\none lump sum per year, and this<br />\nmoney is doled out to the investigator, who is given an account.

Though<br />\nthis virus has been a part of western civilization for<br />\nat least two thousand years, studies currently indicate that herpes simplex types I and 2 are<br />\ndangerously on the rise. Whether this should be<br />\ncausefor alartn is important; actually, the medical<br />\nprofession seems to give the alleged herpes epidemic<br />\nmixed reviews, both in terms of the validity of the<br />\nstatistical claims and in terms of the severity of<br />\ndamage that herpes can cause. Unlike syphilis or<br />\ngonorrhea, herpes is at present incurable, and the<br />\neffectiveness of even the most recent advances in<br />\ntreatment is in serious question. There has,<br />\nhowever, been some exaggeration in the media attention paid to the genital herpes matter over the<br />\npast several months. This article is afresh attempt<br />\nto assess the current state of herpes in our society,<br />\nprovide an indication of future medical<br />\ndevelopments dealing with herpes and elucidate<br />\nwhat this all means to us now, with the focus on<br />\nthe way herpes is making itselffelt on this and other<br />\ncampuses.<br /><br />\nconglomeration, though seemingly sturdy, can not<br />\nsurvive outside the body, and therefore can only be<br />\ntransmitted by direct contact. Once in the body,<br />\nhowever, it replicates very quickly, leading to the<br />\nexternal eruptions previously described.<br />\nAbout a half-million new cases of herpes simplex<br />\n'develop each year; half of these won't display any<br />\n;recurrent symptoms. However, since herpes is at<br />\nthis time incurable, the number of carriers never<br />\ndecreases. The emotional effects of herpes are astounding. Victims may suffer shock, fear, anger,<br />\ndeepening depression and a sense of hopelessness,<br />\nin part because of the tremendous reputation herpes<br />\nhas gained in recent years. There have been a<br />\nnumber of suicides resulting from extreme fear of<br />\nthe disease.<br /><br />\nWHAT HERPES IS<br /><br />\nThe search for a cure for herpes has been in full<br />\nswing for almost a decade, and most experimental<br />\ndrugs have proven ineffective. Nonetheless, last<br />\nspring, acyclovir was approved by the Food and<br />\nDrug Administration as useful in preventing herpes<br />\ntype 1 and herpes zoster (an acute viral infection<br />\nof the skin) infections from spreading; it cannot prevent the actual transmission of the virus. This<br />\ndiscovery was the result of test tube experiments and<br /><br />\nThe herpes viruses come in various types., including those responsible for common chicken pox<br />\nand shingles. The types attracting the most attention now, however, are herpes simplex type 1, which<br />\ncauses the eruption of cold sores and blisters on the<br />\nlace and upper body, and herpes simplex type 2,<br />\nalso known as genital herpes, which has been linked to cancer of the cervix, and can be passed on<br />\nto newborn infants. The primary transmission of<br />\ngenital herpes occurs through sexual contact, and,<br />\nn fact, the distinction between types 1 and 2 is<br />\nDecoming more fuzzy, in part, it is theorized, due<br />\nto oral sex. It seems that an active type 1 infection<br />\non the face easily can be transmitted to the genital<br />\nregion; likewise an active type 2 eruption on the<br />\ngenitalia can be transmitted to the partner's face,<br />\nand cause similar infection there.<br />\nThe typical onset of a herpes simplex attack is<br />\nfirst noticed within four days of transmission, when<br />\nsmall red bumps erupt, turning into blisters which<br />\ndry into crusty sores. Though these sores may heal<br />\nand vanish within one or two weeks, the herpes<br />\nvirus itself retreats within the body's nerve tissues.<br />\nFor about half of those who contract herpes, the<br />\ninitial flare-up is not repeated. However, recurrent<br />\nattacks are known to occur up to several times per<br />\nyear in many herpes victims. The factors contributing to these recurrences will be discussed later.<br />\nAbout 90 percent of the U.S. population has been<br />\nexposed to type 1, while approximately 60 percent<br />\nof the population has been exposed to the type 2<br />\nvirus. Health officials say simplex type 2 has only<br />\nbecome a major problem since the mid-1970s, when<br />\nthe percentage of those afflicted with the disease<br />\nskyrocketed. Type 2 appears as external lesions on<br />\nthe genitalia which last for about two weeks at a<br />\ntime. In women, the lesions may erupt inside the<br />\nvagina as well. The side effects of herpes are wideranged, and include fever. In its most severe forms,<br />\nthis virus may lead to meningitis, and could even<br />\nbe fatal.<br />\nThough it has been suggested that immunity to<br />\nthe herpes virus, through increased contact to colds<br />\nand infections in the early years of life, Dr. Laure<br />\nAurelian, a researcher associated with the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, maintains that \"There is absolutely no documented evidence to substantiate any<br />\nsuch conclusion. Immunity, per se, to the herpes<br />\nsimplex has no where been authenticated to date,<br />\nand any suggestion of such an immunity is a<br />\nfalsehood.\"<br />\nThe recurrence of' herpes four or five times a year<br />\nmay be triggered by injury, colds, sunburn, stress<br />\nor fever, among other things. Dr. John Skouge, dermatology specialist with Johns Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nconjectures that\" a woman afflicted with the herpes<br />\nsimplex may suffer a relapse when having a period<br />\nduring the monthly cycle. A second explanation has<br />\nbeen linked to mental stress or negative emotions.<br />\nThat is to say, people having the herpes simplex may<br />\nexperience a sharp recurrence when their mood or<br />\nemotions drop.\"<br />\nWhile it is inactive, after it has temporarily<br />\nretreated to a group of nerve cells near the base of<br />\nthe spine, it is dormant, and can not be transmitted. The herpes cell itself is four times the size of<br />\na common cold virus. It is composed of DNA,surrounded by protective layers of dense polymers and<br />\nwrapped in a water-tight membrane of fats. This<br /><br />\nACYCLOVIR:<br />\nAN ANSWER?<br /><br />\nHERPES ON CAMPUS<br />\nAND OFF<br />\nAccording to the Hopkins Health Clinic, the<br />\nherpes situation on campus is becoming very<br />\nserious. \"We feel that we are seeing more herpes<br />\nthan in the past,\" says Director Joan Rehner, and<br />\nas a result, the staff has been addressing the situation in an effort to control the problem, the size<br />\nof which has been estimated at\"one to five cases<br />\na week, some of them recurrent.\"<br />\nThe clinic's main efforts are geared toward giving the patients accurate information on herpes, and<br />\ntalking to them to lessen the psychological pains<br />\nupon diagnosis of herpes. Once herpes is diagnosed, the staff tries to get the patient to talk openly,<br />\nbecause herpes is often \"psychologically traumatizing for them,\" says Rehner. They also give the patients pertinent information since \"a lot of them<br />\nhave a lot of misconceptions about the disease.\"<br />\nBesides helping the victims to deal with the<br />\npsychological effects of the disease, the health clinic<br />\ndoes, on occasion, give out acyclovir, which can be<br />\nobtained in ointment or systemic form. They also<br />\nemphasize to all that it is definitely helpful in controlling the disease if the male wears a condom during sexual intercourse.<br />\nThe center is also considering establishing a selfhelp group for herpes sufferers. Mimi Bianchi and<br />\nthe members of the Student Health Advisory Committee support the idea. Rehner, however, feels that<br />\nthis will be difficult to organize since the afflicted<br /><br />\nerpes:<br />\nscientists are not sure it will be totally effective. New<br />\nforms of acyclovir will hopefully speed healing and<br />\ndiminish spreading of the disease. In September,<br />\nresearchers led by Dr. Arvid E. Nilsen at the University Hospital in Bergen, Norway, determined<br />\nthat orally-administered acyclovir was effective in<br />\ncountering recurrent genital herpes, as well as initial outbreaks. Until now, the only genuine preventative medicine was abstinence, aided in some cases<br />\nby the \"prodome,\"a tingling or aching prior to a<br />\nrecurrent outbreak of herpes, which serves a warning to avoid sexual contact for a few weeks.<br />\nThough acyclovir has been approved as a treatment, no cure for herpes simplex seems in sight.<br />\nMedical research seems concerned primarily with<br />\ndetermining why herpes can be recurrent in some<br />\npeople and not in others. Says Aurelian, \"If we<br />\nunderstand what causes the virus to remain dormant<br />\nafter it enters the body, then we may have some<br />\nhope of finding a cure for those that suffer from<br />\nrecurrences. It is important to note that a recent<br />\nstudy in the May 1, 1982 edition of Science News<br />\nmagazine, had this very proposition raised. It was<br />\nsuggested that by developing a drug which might<br />\nkeep herpes viruses perpetually latent in ganglia,<br />\nrather than from periodically becoming 'active' and<br />\n'infecting,' the [recurrent] herpes sufferer might be<br />\nrestored to a normal life.\"<br />\nOf less concern is the search for something which<br />\nwould eliminate or prevent the virus. Since past efforts have produced insignificant progress in this<br />\ndirection, current research ignores the approach,<br />\nconcentrating instead on developing more effective<br />\ntreatments.<br /><br />\nby<br />\nJennifer Brezenoff<br />\nGillian Clark<br />\nCatherine Raeff<br />\nMichael Vardac<br />\nare generally unwilling to discuss the disease openly. SHAC hopes for more success in this direction,<br />\nand is planning to sponsor an on-campus discussion panel on herpes sometime in February.<br />\nPatients are often referred to Dr. Aurelian. She<br />\nsays that herpes is one of \"the most serious problems on campus,\" and like the health center, she<br />\nprovides the victims with accurate information and<br />\ngives them advice for their future sexual activities.<br />\nThrough all these efforts, the health center is<br />\nseriously trying to control the Hopkins herpes situation. But despite their efforts, Rehner feels that the<br />\nspread of the disease will continue at its current rate<br />\nin the future.<br />\nHelen Phrash, manager of the Venereal Diseases<br />\nClinic of the Planned Parenthood Organization of<br />\nBaltimore, claims that the media has created the<br />\nrumor regarding the resurgence of herpes. The increase in reported herpes cases in the past twenty<br />\nyears should have been expected.<br />\n\"People are having sex more often and with more<br />\npartners,\" [thrash says, \"therefore, they are more<br /><br />\nprone to infection.\" Then there might be no true<br />\nherpes epidemic. In fact, attending college in<br />\nBaltimore might mislead one into surmising that<br />\nherpes and smallpox appear with the same<br />\nfrequency.<br />\nThe Goucher College Student Infirmary reports<br />\nthat while there have been reported a few cases of<br />\nherpes on campus, it is not a serious problem; in<br />\nfact we were told that it was a rare occurence. A<br />\nsexuality course is offered on campus in which communicable diseases are covered, and gynecological<br />\nteaching sessions on V.D. are held. The Goucher<br />\nStudent Health Advisory Board, like the Hopkins<br />\ncounterpart SHAC, plays a role in keeping Goucher<br />\nhealthy.<br />\nNor do the young women of Notre Dame appear<br />\nto have a serious problem with Herpes. Mary L.<br />\nAkens, Director of Student Health, says, \"Incidents<br />\nare very rare.\" The majority of the students are<br />\nlegal adults, and because of this they may not<br />\nnecessarily report illness to the College Health Services, but go directly to their own physicians. Akens<br />\nstates, however,\"Cases that do come to our attention are referred primarily to private<br />\ngynecologists.\" Being a small college, herpes<br />\ncounseling and information are provided on an individual basis.<br />\nMorgan State University, a large black coed institution, has had no reported cases of herpes on<br />\ncampus. Dr. Phillips, a physician at the Campus<br />\nHealth Center, claims Morgan students are very well<br />\ninformed; in addition, many are commuters, and<br />\nmay seek health care off-campus.

However,<br />\nactual figures can not be obtained because the Student Health Clinic refers any student suspected of<br />\ncontracting herpes to the Baltimore Planned Parenthood clinic.<br />\nHelen Phrash claims that for college students<br />\nsuspected of having herpes, very few of their suspit ions are worthwhile. The figures representing redblooded American college students between the ages<br />\nof 18 and 24 are quite encouraging. In one<br />\nyear,1977, Baltimore students were given initial exams. Out of these, only 37 were suspected of having herpes, and from those 37 students very few actually had the disease.<br />\nThe figures reported by Phrash however could<br />\nbe misleading and limited. Mr. L. T. Stewart, from<br />\nthe V.D. Control Division of the Baltimore County Department of Health, says informative figures<br />\nare difficult to obtain because herpes is not a reportable disease like gonorrhea and syphilis. \"Unlike<br />\nthe two common venereal diseases, herpes carriers<br />\nare not required to report the incidence of the<br />\ndisease to the health departments.\" The department<br />\ncan offer no cure or treatment; only counseling is<br />\ngiven. Patients are seen on a fairly regular basis and<br />\nthe department does receive a number of calls from<br />\npeople requesting information. Contrary to<br />\nPhrash's figures and observations, Stewart claims,<br />\n\"We're seeing a lot of it.\" He considers herpes a<br />\nsignificant problem in Baltimore County.<br />\nBill Palm, principal educator with the Sexually<br />\nTransmitted Diseases Program of the Baltimore City Department of Health, was much less optimistic<br />\nthan Phrash. Although his figures are not completely accurate, he considers them close estimates. Palm<br />\nguesses that Baltimore sees 2000 new cases of herpes<br />\neach year. Getting to bare facts: the clinics reported<br />\n917 cases of herpes last year, more than half of them<br />\nblack males. Though Johns Hopkins Hospital and<br />\nprivate physicians also reported a small number of<br />\ncases, predominantly white females, Palm calls it<br />\nan \"equal opportunity disease.\"<br />\nPalm explains, \"Contracting herpes would be<br />\nmore of a nuisance, a worry, to an affluent person.<br />\nBut if you are black and poor it is really not a priority. There are other things to worry about. Then the<br />\ndisease would go unreported.\" The age range runs<br />\nfrom adolescence to middle age, yet there is a<br />\npreponderance in sexually-active individuals in their<br />\ntwenties.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n111,*'4 .,.

Many private physicians<br />\nhave difficulty recognizing herpes. \"The chief difficulty today in identifying the herpes simplex,\"<br />\nbelieves Dr. John Skouge, another Hopkins hospital<br />\nresearcher, \"lies largely in the education of most<br />\ndoctors conducting such examinations. Often the<br />\ntraining of general practitioners is not sufficient in<br />\nthis area, and this leads to the virus being identified<br />\nas something else in some cases. Moreover, there<br />\nare very few laboratories at present which maintain<br />\nthe proper techniques for accurate detection.\"<br />\nThis lack of knowledge on the part of doctors is<br />\na cause for worry. It herpes is suspected, Bill Palm<br />\nsuggests \"you might want to see a dermatologist<br />\nrather than a gynecologist. Herpes is an infection<br />\nof the skin and dermatologists are better informed<br />\non the subject.\"<br />\nFollowing treatment, many might worry, that<br />\nherpes, particularly recurrent strains, would have<br />\na stifling effect on one's lifestyle. Skouge assures,<br />\nhowever, that sex after herpes is possible. In order<br />\nto prevent the transmission of the virus to one's<br />\nfuture partners, he suggests,\"A few important considerations must be borne in mind. The herpes<br />\nsimplex is a disease which recurs at periodic intervals. The virus may lie dormant within an individual<br />\nfor months, up to a year, at a time. What must be<br />\nunderstood by those affected by the disease, is that<br />\nat the first sign of an infection, i.e. tingling or itching sensation in the mouth or genital areas [the<br />\nprodome], the person must break Off from having<br /><br />\nany sexual'contact with another individual. This is<br />\ncrucial since the virus can be easily transferred to<br />\nanother during this period of relapse, which may<br />\nlast from seven to ten days. With these episodes of<br />\nrecurrence happening once or twice a year, an afflicted person may carefully plan his or her sexual<br />\nhabits to avoid any fear of passing on the disease.<br />\nIn this manner, an individual could conceivably<br />\nbecome married, have children, and never endanger<br />\nhis or her immediate family by exercising prudence.<br />\nThis is often the case.\"<br />\nLastly, how can herpes be avoided by an<br />\nuninfected party? Well, awareness and caution in<br />\nthis sexually active age are still essential. The following are Helen Phrash's basic steps to follow to stay<br />\nyoung, pretty and herpes free:<br />\nIt is to the woman's advantage to keep her own sup<br />\nply of condoms.<br />\nIt is unwise to carry condoms in a wallet or<br />\nanywhere else close to the body.(The heat causes<br />\nthem to lose their effectiveness.)<br />\nContrary to popular belief, it's still safe to sit down<br />\nwhen you use public bathrooms. Herpes can only<br />\nbe contracted from the toilet seat if you are having<br />\nsex on it.<br />\nThose who do have herpes simplex should act with<br />\ncaution. For example, never touch a cold sore on<br />\nthe mouth and then touch the genital area. Simplex<br />\n1 can very well transform into simplex 2, and viceversa.<br />\nAgain, it must be stressed that the only sure way<br />\nto prevent contracting herpes simplex is through<br />\nabstinence. Though much remains to be learned<br />\nabout the virus, with further advances in the<br />\nmedical and psychological treatment of the<br />\ndisease,and further education of the public in<br />\ngeneral, the catastrophic aura now surrounding<br />\nherpes may be dispelled.<br /><br />\nPAGE 12/OCTOBER /9, 1982<br /><br />\nTWO GRAND<br />\nA PRIZE WINNERS<br />\nII WILL BE<br />\nWitaiiiiiiiati<br />\nSCHUTZ'S GUESTS<br />\nIN TORONTO<br />\n/ FOR THE LAST<br />\nPERFORMANCE OF<br />\nTHE WHO'S 1982<br />\nNORTH AMERICAN TOUR.<br /><br />\n41141111111111117<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nThis may be your last chance to see in<br />\nperson one of the world's great rock<br />\nlegends.

But you may not know that<br />\nChester's Place has prompted a spinoff: Chester's Concert Series.<br />\nLike Chester's Place, the series is<br />\nfunded by the Office of the Chaplain,<br />\nwith the proceeds going to the Hopkins<br />\nTutorial Project. The series is comprised of Friday or Saturday night concerts<br />\nby popular local bands, usually taking<br />\nplace in the Great Hall. The music<br />\nranges from rock to reggae, from<br />\noriginal material to cover versions of<br />\nother artists' songs.<br />\nThe man in charge of the Series is<br />\nHopkins alumnus Dave Fishkin (Class<br />\nof '76). It is Fishkin who, with the help<br />\nof four Hopkins work/study students,<br />\nbooks the bands and runs the events. He<br />\nis not a newcomer to the Chaplain's Office; for three years, he was the director of the Tutorial Project. Currently a<br /><br />\nlawyer in private practice, Fishkin still for the Tutorial Project, and Fishkin<br />\nfinds the time to promote various fund- hopes to be as successful with the new<br />\nraisin activities for the Chaplain's Of- series. So far, though, the concerts have<br />\nnot been drawing as many people as had<br />\nbeen expected. For the most part, each<br />\nconcert has been attracting about 60 or<br />\n70 people. Fishkin says,\"We could easily double that. We need at least one hundred to make it work.\"<br />\nThe concerts are open to the general<br />\npublic, which Fishkin sees as very<br />\npositive, but he also believes that \"the<br />\nsuccess of the series depends on the support of Hopkins students. We very<br />\n.much want Hopkins students. The concerts are very much for the students<br />\nhere, although we have a wide variety<br />\nof people who come.\" And if this series<br />\nis successful, there may be a second one<br />\nimplemented next spring.<br />\nAccording to Fishkin, the two main<br />\ngoals of the series are to raise money for<br />\n.the Tutorial Project and to improve the<br />\nsive Ir ishkin, of Chester's<br />\nsocial life at Hopkins by providing a<br />\n\u2022fice. The October 17 Michael Hedges campus activity that \"the students enconcert Fishkin organized raised $300 joy doing.\"<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nAdmission is $2.50, but as an incentive for the Hopkins student body, discount coupons for the series will be placed in campus mailboxes some time this<br />\nweek. \"Buy one drink, get one free\"<br />\ncoupons can also be found in the<br />\n\"Moneymania\" booklets distributed at<br />\nthe start of the semester. Draught beer<br />\nand fruit juices are available at each<br />\nconcert. Those under 18 are welcome;<br />\nhowever, IDs are checked at the bar.<br />\nUpcoming concerts include a<br />\nNovember 6 Glass Pavilion concert by<br />\nUsed Parts; the Reactors in the Great<br />\nHall on November 13; and, also in the<br />\nGreat Hall, Hopkins' own Rose Colored<br />\nHugh on November 19. The Reactors<br />\nand Rose Colored Hugh have strong<br />\nlocal followings, while Used Parts is<br />\ndescribed by Fishkin as \"a fun dance<br />\nband.\"<br />\nBut still the question remains: will<br />\nHopkins students support the Concert<br />\nSeries? Fishkin states his case plainly:<br />\n\"There's just no reason why they<br />\nshouldn't come.\"<br /><br />\ns<br /><br />\nPAGE 14/OCTOBER 29, 1982<br /><br />\nHam on Wry<br /><br />\nAmazing Folks, Amazing Feats<br /><br />\nBY MIKE KUN<br /><br />\nThough I complain about it a lot, my life has<br />\nbeen pretty exciting.

It's fencing, and<br />\nit's heading for another potentially successful year under the<br />\ndirectjon of Coach Dick Oles.<br />\nBlue Jay fencing has traditionally had an excellent record.<br />\nStill,<br />\nlast<br />\nyear's<br />\naccomplishments were considered<br />\nonly \"a notch above the bare<br />\nminimum,\" according to<br />\nCoach Oles, despite individual<br />\nperformances leading to the<br />\nepee and sabre trophies from<br />\nthe MACFA championship<br />\ntournament, and Roger<br />\nBlauvelt's conference championship in epee.<br />\nEven though the conference<br />\nseason does not commence for<br />\nanother two to three months,<br />\nofficial varsity practices have<br />\nalready begun, and the team<br />\n\u2022 has fenced in a couple of<br />\nUnited States Fencing Association (USFA) tournaments. As<br />\nfor predictions for this year's<br />\nsixteen<br />\nman varistv squad,<br />\n\"It's too early to say,\" according to foil captain John Tu.<br />\nCoach Oles agrees \"I don't<br />\nreally know...our schedule is<br />\nnot complete yet.\" Also, the<br />\nepee and sabre lineups are not<br />\nset yet, after the loss of three of<br />\nlast year's starters who had<br />\nbeen expected to return. All of<br />\nthe foils, on the other hand, are<br />\nback, with the addition of Andy Goldberg, a talented<br />\nfreshman fencer coming out of<br />\nLong Island; the foil team<br />\nlooks very strong indeed.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, there is a tremendous emphasis on rebuilding<br />\nthe team, since a majority of<br />\nlast year's starters have either<br />\ngraduated or left the team. A<br />\nsignificant aspect to this<br /><br />\nfact, the epee and sabre cap- the unitorms ot this remarkable<br />\ntains, Roger Blauvelt and Taro team are students, most of<br />\nAdachi, respectively, are both whom (about 95 percent) have<br />\nnever fenced before coming to<br />\nsophomores.<br />\nThe upcoming season, then, Hopkins.

Wednes, day the team was beaten 2-0 by<br />\nWidener.<br /><br />\nIT<br /><br />\nThe F&amp;M game was another<br />\none of those games which have<br />\nbeen typical of the season. The<br />\nteam played strong defense,<br />\nand the offense had the opportunities, but could not complete<br />\nthe plays. A good one by F&amp;M<br />\nmidway through the second<br />\nhalf gave them the victory.<br /><br />\nThe Widener game was a<br />\nvery frustrating one for the<br />\nHopkins squad. While the<br />\nstatistics were fairly close, the<br />\ngame was in actuality dominated by Widener, as their<br />\ndefense shut down the Hopkins<br />\noffense at every opportunity.<br />\nTonight, the team is home<br />\nagainst Washington College,<br />\nand next Tuesday they host<br />\nGettysburg in the final regular<br />\nseason game.

Both games<br />\nwere against tough opponents,<br />\nand the Jays played well<br />\nthroughout.<br />\nHopkins played Haverford<br />\nat home last Thursday. Haverford was one of the strongest<br />\nopponents the Jays have played<br />\n\u2014they were quick, with good<br />\nball control, and hard hitting.<br />\nBut the Jays gave them a<br />\nmatch, beating them 1-0. The<br />\ngoal, however, did not come<br />\nuntil the last ten minutes of the<br />\nsecond half, after an hour of<br />\nhard, back-and-forth play. Jennifer O'Connor scored the goal<br />\noff a pass from Sharon Horvath. The Jays tried for a second goal on a hard drive in the<br />\nlast few minutes, but time<br />\nquickly ran out. Martha Gottling made some beautiful plays,<br />\nespecially with her stick work<br />\non one-on-ones. Right wing<br />\nJudy Schmidt used her ball control skills to advantage on the<br />\nboundary line\u2014no one could<br />\nget the ball away from her<br /><br />\nwithout sending it out of<br />\nbounds. Monique Muri, Amy<br />\nZimmerman and goalie Wendy<br />\nAtkinson also played well,<br />\nhelping to bring in the will for<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAt Dickinson, though, they<br />\ndid not do as well as they had<br />\nagainst Haverford, losing 1-0.<br />\nThe Jays' defense and attack<br />\nplayed well against this tough<br />\nopponent, but a few bad calls<br />\nhurt Hopkins.

Also, it<br />\nseems that a few balls did go into the goal cage, yet they came<br />\nback out quickly and the<br />\nreferees did not see them.<br />\nAgain, the Jays exhibited their<br />\nusual good stick work and team<br />\nconsideration, but were unable<br />\nto score.<br />\nThe hackers' record now<br />\nstands at 4-6-1.

Money has<br />\nbeen allocated for this program<br />\nand lecturers lined up, and if it<br />\nis successful, things will continue from there. Japanese and<br />\nKorean language programs may<br />\nbe developed, as well as a<br />\ncourse in Far Eastern History,<br />\nand if all goes well, Hopkins<br />\nmay have a Far Eastern Studies<br />\ndepartment in a few years.<br />\nSuccess, however, is dependent upon student interest. For<br />\nthis reason, the Chinese<br />\nStudents' Association has put<br />\ntogether a questionnaire to<br />\ndetermine interest in this program, and it should be in<br />\nstudents' mailboxes within a<br />\nweek or so. Read it carefully. A<br />\nFar Eastern Studies program<br />\nhas many facets, and many<br />\nstudents should be interested in<br />\none or more. Possibilities<br />\nbeyond the languages include<br />\nstudies of Far Eastern art,<br />\nmusic and philosophy.<br />\nThe development of this program will also help promote an<br />\nexchange program with the Nan<br />\nJing University in the People's<br />\nRepublic of China, not to mention the benefits it will have for<br />\nstudents in International Relations. So let's hear from people<br />\ninterested in a too-long<br />\nneglected area of study.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nHeidi J. Berube<br />\nSusan L. Kwok<br /><br />\nTime For Real Issues<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn the News-Letter of<br />\n10/15/82, a quote was ascribed to me concerning the SAC<br />\nfreezing of Student Council<br />\nfunds. I would like to clarify<br />\nmy position to dissipate any<br />\nfalse impressions anyone may<br />\nhave drawn from the quote.<br />\nTo begin, I would like to affirm that I could not, and did<br />\nnot represent the SAC at the<br />\n10/13/82 Student Council<br />\nmeeting or anytime since the<br />\nend of my term as SAC<br />\nsecretary. My statement was<br />\nmade as a club officer and<br />\nvoting member of the SAC,<br />\nand I made no pretentions of<br />\nrepresentating [sic] the SAC.<br />\nDespite all that I have been<br />\nsubjected to by the Student<br />\nCouncil, I did not personally<br />\n'favor the freezing of council<br />\nfunds over the issue described<br />\nin the article, and I have publicly stated this on several occasions. My statement was an offthe-cuff remark made in a<br />\nprivate conversation with the<br />\nauthor of the article, not a<br />\npublic pronouncement made at<br />\na meeting, and constituted my<br />\nperception of the sentiments of<br />\nthe members of the SAC and a<br />\nprediction of their actions, not<br />\nthe personal desires of Grant<br />\nLally.<br />\nI stand by the prediction that<br /><br />\nthe SAC would have frozen the<br />\nfunds of the Student Council,<br />\nhad. coun-il again reaffirmed<br />\nits desire to hold the exclusive<br />\npower to amend the SAC constitution without any notification or consultation with the<br />\nSAC, by again rejecting the<br />\nSAC amendment. I worked last<br />\nyear with the SAC, and have<br />\nrecently spoken to many SAC<br />\nmembers, and found a very<br />\nstrong sentiment against the recent actions of the Student<br />\nCouncil directed against the independence of the SAC and its<br />\nconstituent clubs.<br />\nI was very nattered that the<br />\nNews-Letter quoted me alone<br />\namong the 70 members of the<br />\nSAC, and I am sure that, had<br />\nthere been a strong sentiment<br />\nwithin the SAC against the<br />\nfreezure [sic] of SC funds, then<br />\nthe N-L ,in the interests of objective journalism, would have<br />\nquoted a spokesman of that<br />\nperspective. Since they did not,<br />\ntheir inquiries must have<br />\nresulted in a conclusion similar<br />\nto mine.<br />\nIt is my hope that the passage<br />\nof this amendment will initiate<br />\nan end to the maneuverings of<br />\nthose council radicals who see<br />\ncentralization of power and<br />\nTammany practices as the bean and end-all of their council<br />\nexperience. There are too many<br />\nissues of vital importance to the<br />\nstudent body\u2014traffic safety,<br />\nimproving University Housing,<br />\ninsuring fair educational practices, and others\u2014for the Student Council to be wasting its<br />\ntime trying to extend its reign<br />\nover the SAC or playing games<br />\nwith election results. Those<br />\nseven SC members who voted<br />\nto approve the amendment<br />\ndeserve to be thanked for their<br />\naction, and I, for one, hope<br />\nthat they can convince their<br />\nmore puerile cohorts to direct<br />\ntheir energies toward more productive ends.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nGrant Lally<br /><br />\nPSU/JSA Clarification<br /><br />\nelsewhere. Perhaps the PSU<br />\norganizers were not aware of<br />\nthe Coalition's plans, or were<br />\nnot able to control their actions<br />\nonce the event began. But surely the PSU, with its relatively<br />\nsmall membership, was expecting help from the Coalition to<br />\npolice the large audience long<br />\nbefore they became occupied<br />\nwith the outside protesters. In<br />\nany case, by bringing in outside<br />\nforces for security, the PSU is<br />\naccountable for the Coalition's<br />\nactions and for their own illpreparedness to handle a potentially risky situation.<br />\n2. In regards to the second<br />\nstudent who was ejected, he<br />\nwas not, as your reporter<br />\nstated, \"escorted\" out. He was<br />\nshoved out after a member of<br />\nthe audience assaulted another<br />\nstudent and he stepped between<br />\nthose two to prevent a fight.<br />\nHis reward was to be assaulted<br />\nby several men who took it<br />\nupon themselves to serve as<br />\nsecurity before the Hopkins<br />\npolice took over.<br />\nYour coverage was generally<br />\nquite thorough, and I realize<br />\nyou can't have reporters in<br />\nevery nook and cranny of the<br />\nroom. Nonetheless, these facts<br />\nare relevant to the overall story<br />\nand should be brought to light.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nAyala Hecht<br />\nB.A. '82<br /><br />\nNo PLO At JHU<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nRegardless of what it was<br />\ncalled, last week's PSU-<br /><br />\nsponsored pro-Palestinian<br />\n\"teach-in\" was not a teach-in<br />\nat all. The severely limited<br />\ndiscussion and the security tactics of throwing out dissenters<br />\nturned the program into a rally<br />\nfor the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) to preach its<br />\nvicious anti-Israel rhetoric. The<br />\nPSU should be dechartered<br />\nsolely for the terrible way in<br />\nwhich security was handled.<br />\nHowever, the program itself<br />\nshould not have ben allowed by<br />\nthe University in the first place.<br />\nThe PLO is a terrorist group,<br />\nresponsible for the deaths of<br />\nthousands of innocent men,<br />\nwomen and children. The PLO<br />\nhas planted bombs in school<br />\nbuildings, has carried out<br />\nnumerous bloody airplane hijackings (e.g., Entebbe, 1976),<br />\nhas gunned down unarmed<br />\ncivilians, both in Israel and<br />\nthroughout the world (e.g. the<br />\nMunich Olympics, 1972), and<br />\nhas murdered moderate Palestinian leaders who were willing to<br />\ndiscuss peace with Israel. And<br />\nthe PLO repeatedly vows to liquidate Israel, to push the Jews<br />\ninto the sea.<br />\nIn the light of all this, a PLO<br />\nspokesman was invited to speak<br />\non campus, with the approval<br />\nof the Hopkins Administration.<br />\nIt's time for the University to<br />\nissue a policy banning hate<br />\ngroups and terrorist groups<br />\nfrom speaking on campus. Notwithstanding the right to free<br />\nspeech, the University is not<br />\nobligated to provide a forum<br />\nfor such groups. Is providing<br />\nthis type of forum in the best<br />\ninterests of Hopkins students?<br />\nAlso, what image does Hopkins<br /><br />\nwant to project to the academic<br />\ncommunity, and to the<br />\nBaltimore community?<br />\nThe absence of an Administration ban opens up the<br />\nUniversity to any number of<br />\norganizations preaching hate<br />\nand violence. Having had the<br />\nPLO and its views on Israel, we<br />\nshould invite the Red Brigades<br />\nto tell us their views on Italy,<br />\nand the Irish Republican Army<br />\nto speak about Great Britain.<br />\nAnd while we're at it, we<br />\nshould also invite neo-Nazis to<br />\nspeak on campus. And of<br />\ncourse, we should have the Ku<br />\nKlux Klan here to present its<br />\nviews about white supremacy.<br />\nNo matter how repulsive we<br />\nmight find these groups, they<br />\nall have just as much of a right<br />\nto speak as the PLO. In view of<br />\ncurrent Administration policy,<br />\nnot to allow them to speak here<br />\nwould be hypocrisy on the part<br />\nof all those (including the<br />\nNews-Letter) who claimed that<br />\nnot allowing the PLO to speak<br />\nhere would be a violation of<br />\ntheir right to free speech.<br /><br />\nSincerely,<br />\nRobert Morrison<br />\nAline Hutner<br />\nSander Smith<br /><br />\nRe: Moran's Op-ed<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nDoreen, you're a gem.<br />\nDavid Hurwitz<br /><br />\nCOLLEGE ENGINEERS<br />\n,<br />\nvias's,)'<br />\no400<br />\n4,Ax.w,0<br />\n0O.<br />\ns<br />\nLa k\u00b0<br />\n\u201e,<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nA few points of clarification in<br />\nregards to your coverage of last<br />\nweek's PSU Teach-In:<br />\nI.

The loyal Hopkins contingent, bearing the brunt of the<br />\nwinter-like winds, watched<br />\npleasingly as Coach Pfeifer lead<br />\nhis troops to a 24-7 pounding of<br />\nthe Lebanon Valley Dutchmen.<br />\nThe game was never very<br />\nclose. Hopkins accumulated an<br />\ninsurmountable 24-0 score,<br />\nbefore the Dutchmen finally<br />\nthreatened at the 4:08 mark in<br />\nthe fourth quarter with a two-<br /><br />\nyard touchdown run, capping a<br />\n38-yard drive.<br />\nThe Jay's defense was<br />\ntenacious\u2014allowing Lebanon<br />\nValley a mere 30 yards rushing<br />\nand 108 yards in the air. Jay<br />\nSmith had a big day at the outside linebacker spot, with an interception, a fumble recovery<br />\nand a fistful of tackles and<br />\nsacks.

According to Student Council President Doug Fel!man, if no more<br />\ntickets are sold, the council<br />\nwould lose roughly $8000, the<br />\nentire budget of both the Social<br />\nCommittee and the Speakers<br />\nand Concerts Committee for<br />\nthe full year.<br />\nSaying that he was \"less than<br />\npleased with what has gone<br />\non,\" Junior Class President<br />\nMike Kun moved, in an attempt to get more people involved in selling tickets, that the<br />\nentire Student Council be placed on the Speakers and Concerts Committee. The motion<br />\npassed overwhelmingly.<br />\nAfter the meeting, Speaker<br />\nand Concerts Committee CoChairman Jeff Aronoff said he<br />\nwas \"still thinking about\"<br />\nKun's motion, and had formed no opinion on it.<br /><br />\nIn another attempt to sell<br />\ntickets, Fellman appointed<br />\ncouncil members to contact<br />\nfraternity presidents, ROTC,<br />\nSAC groups and Director of<br />\nResidential Life, Andrea Perry.<br />\nThe idea is that the leaders of<br />\nthese student groups will urge<br />\nmembers to buy tickets. Through<br />\nPerry, council seeks to get<br />\nhousemasters to encourage<br />\ntheir freshmen to buy tickets.<br />\nOne of the chief problems<br />\nwith the concert, according to<br />\nSocial Committee Chairman<br />\nPat Chicon, is that no one was<br />\nsure it was going to occur until<br />\nlast Monday morning. Aronoff<br />\nreceived the contract that day,<br />\nCichon said, and it was finally<br />\nsigned at 4:00 p.m. this afternoon.
