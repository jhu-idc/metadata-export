The new<br />\nrules, set to go into effect<br />\nFebruary 1, prohibit owners<br />\nfrom bringing their dogs inside<br />\nany campus building, allowing<br />\ndogs to run loose around the<br />\ncampus, or leaving dogs tied to<br />\ntrees or buildings.<br />\nThe rules have met with<br />\nsome controversy as students<br />\ncomplained of exclusion from<br />\nthe decision-making process.<br />\nThis week,junior Ellen H.

As members of the<br />\nGraduate Women's Committee,<br />\nwe are also very concerned with<br />\nuniversity policies regarding<br />\nhiring, promotion, and tenure<br />\ndecisions. Since these policies<br />\ndetermine the composition of<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty, both undergraduate and graduate students<br />\nhave a vested interest in analyzing the fairness and consequences of current university<br />\nprocedures. The quality of our<br />\neducational experience is compromised each time a promising<br />\nwoman, minority, or politically<br />\n\"deviant\" scholar leaves the<br />\nHopkins community.

May I preface my protest<br />\nwith the statement that Levering<br />\nHall, an institution comparable<br />\nto what is generally called \"The<br />\nStudents' Union\" in other universities and colleges, was made<br />\npossible by the generous public<br />\nspirit of Mr. Joshua Levering, a<br />\nscion of a great and old Maryland family, who intended it to<br />\nserve the needs, comfort, and<br />\nsocial requirements of all students and faculty, regardless<br />\nof financial means and affluence.<br />\nSo much for historical reflections. During the past year<br />\nand a half, the charge for a small<br />\nglass of beer has risen arbitrarily<br />\nfrom 30 cents to 50 cents. Two<br />\nweeks ago, it was forty cents \u2014<br />\nnow the concessionaires have<br />\nraised the price by 06 2/3<br />\npercent. Even the ever touted<br />\ncry of \"inflation\", so often used<br />\nas an excuse for raising prices<br />\nin order to gain exhorbitant<br />\nprofit, to satisfy the fourth of<br />\nthe seven Biblical deadly' sins-greed\u2014at the expense of students and faculty. There is no<br />\nvalid excuse for this creeping,<br />\narbitrary gouging of the patrons<br />\nof Levering Hall, especially since<br />\nthe function of Levering Hall is<br />\nto serve, not gouge, the student<br />\nbody and faculty.<br />\nYesterday, I ordered a plain<br />\nham sandwich for my lunch.<br />\nAfter paying 50 cents for<br />\na small paper cup of beer, the<br />\nattendant at the cash register<br />\ncharged me $1.25 for a meagre<br />\nlittle sandwich, made from two<br />\nslices of bread cut from the<br />\nsmallest, skimpiest loaf that<br />\ncommercial bakers sell.

But,<br />\nbefore I do so, I propose a<br />\nwager, that sixpence against<br />\na shilling, the concessionaires<br />\nraise Leer prices to 60 cents<br />\nbefore next June. Any takers?<br />\nIf you have space, Mr.<br />\nEditor, please publish this letter.<br />\nNot that I wish publicity.<br />\nBut if enough of us made<br />\nsufficiently sustained protest<br />\nagainst this price racket, perhaps<br />\nit might be curbed.<br />\nIf you find it is unsuitable<br />\nfor publication in the NewsLetter, please return it to<br />\nme, and I shall try the Johns<br />\nHopkins Magazine and/or the<br />\nBaltimore Sun. This is probably<br />\ncrying in the<br />\nvoice<br />\n\"a<br />\nwilderness,\" as is recorded in the<br />\nOld Testament\u2014but it is a<br />\nvoice, nonetheless. Let us hope<br />\nthat our Levering Hall does not<br />\ncontinue to be a wilderness<br />\nof greedy profiteers.<br />\n<br />\nexcept within a certain clique of<br />\nfriends. In short, the students<br />\nare habituating themselves to<br />\nbeing governed without participating and controlled without<br />\nstopping to ask why. A dangerous precedent to set. It is for<br />\nthis reason that a few of us are<br />\nattempting to re-create a student<br />\npowered and oriented political<br />\nforce at Hopkins. Though we<br />\nhave no official name, or many<br />\nmembers, we believe this group<br />\nholds the potential of emerging<br />\nas a truly unified and cohesive<br />\nforce in the Hopkins community,<br />\none which actually 'holds goals<br />\nand ideals, and is willing to<br />\nwork towards them.<br />\n<br />\nThe groups presently willing<br />\nto question the established<br />\norders have become too diffused<br />\nand splintered to exercise any<br />\npolitical power.

Instead, the university<br />\n<br />\nshould be the one safe domain<br />\nfor students: a place to harbor<br />\nthose youths who care to<br />\neducate themselves and a place<br />\nwhere students should learn to<br />\ncreate and follow their own<br />\nThe students need to<br />\nrules.<br />\ncontrol their own domain--the<br />\nuniversity--as well as functioning<br />\non the national level as a visible<br />\npolitical force.<br />\nThe supposed power groups<br />\nof the students have become too<br />\nentrenched to be questioned<br />\nfrom the outside as institutions<br />\nand too intricate for most<br />\nstudents to know how to exercise their own power. The<br />\npowers of the S.C. grant it the<br />\nability to claim that indeed the<br />\nstudents hold power, yet only a<br />\nhandful of students know what<br />\npower the S.C. holds and even<br />\nfewer can gain access to it.<br />\nIf the vast majority of the<br />\nstudent body is kept ignorant of<br />\nthe assorted powers of the S.C.,<br />\nthen how can the students be<br />\nsaid to hold power, much less<br />\n,exercise it?<br />\nApathy, joined by pessimism and doubt has ruled too<br />\nlong. Apathy begets apathy,and<br />\nwe feel it is time for action and<br />\nenthusiasm to break the chain.<br />\nThis explains why we do not<br />\nbelieve it necessary for all who<br />\njoin to be able to express concretely defined political views--as<br />\nstudents, not sages, we can<br />\nhardly be expected to hold<br />\nRather, joining will<br />\nthem.<br />\nrepresent an urge to break<br />\nthrough the crust of apathy that<br />\nstifles Hopkins: a desire to<br />\nspeak#and be heard; a wish to<br />\nbring power and responsibility<br />\nto the students; a hope to listen<br />\nto and learn from the speakings<br />\nof others.<br />\n<br />\nbroad ideas. The specifics can<br />\nonly come later--once the students have gotten together to<br />\ndiscuss and share views. For<br />\nthis, in such a small community,<br />\nis the only source from which<br />\nthe specifics should spring--not<br />\nfrom a few politicos who have<br />\nlost all practical significance to<br />\nstudents.

The remainder<br />\nare dispersed throughout the<br />\nmetropolitanarea.

Long dead now, his memory remains in my heart and<br />\nmind. I had the privilege of<br />\nstudying Greek History and<br />\nLiterature under him. It was a<br />\nunique experience, and one I<br />\nstill cherish warmly despite my<br />\n74 years of life.<br />\nDavid Moore Robinson was<br />\na great scholar, teacher, and<br />\nauthor. His scholarly publications are legion; his standing and<br />\nrecognition in the world of<br />\nacademe, as well as in the public<br />\nat large remain a monument to<br />\nhis scholarly and intellectual<br />\nattainments.<br />\nDr. Robinson was also a<br />\nvery<br />\ncharming<br />\npersonality.<br />\nShort, chubby, healthily redfaced, he used to beam out over<br />\nthe podium in the Classics<br />\nDepartment Seminar Room with<br />\na puckish gleam of humor.<br />\nHe also, God forgive me for<br />\nrecording it, had quite a marked<br />\nbawdy streak in his august<br />\nHe delighted in<br />\npersonality.<br />\nquips that were distinctly risque<br />\nand earth-earthy.<br />\nI recall vividly, although it<br />\nhas been nearly 40 years ago,<br />\nwhen he took his graduate class<br />\nin Greek History to the Walters<br />\nGallery of Art, where he was a<br />\nTrustee and had keys to the<br />\nlocked, exhibition cabinets. He<br />\nopened one of these cabinets<br />\nand took out carefully an<br />\nexquisite figurine of a young<br />\nGreek woman, quite lovely in<br />\nher alabaster beauty. I believe<br />\nthat the artist was a student of<br />\nPraxitiles, although my daily<br />\njournal, a diary that I kept,<br />\nwhich makes possible this memoir of Dr. Robinson, does not<br />\nconfirm the artist who made the<br />\nfigurine. Regardless, it was an<br />\nexquisite example of early Greek<br />\nminiature sculpture. Undraped,<br />\nthe artist had achieved a compelling replica of her female form.<br />\nDr. Robinson held the figurine up and discussed the artist's<br />\ntechnique and in recreating her<br />\nfemale beauty.<br />\nThen the august Professor<br />\ngently caressed the figure with<br />\nhis chubby hands, and with a<br />\nsort of smirking smile, said:<br />\n\"And, she has such lovely<br />\ntits,\" and gently rubbed his<br />\nthumb and forefinger over the<br />\nstatuette's lovely curved breasts.<br />\nThere was a dead silence<br />\nafter this; there were two<br />\nwimpled Nuns of a teaching<br />\norder in the class. They blushed<br />\nlike American Beauty roses in<br />\nJune. But our Dr. Robinson<br />\nmerely grinned with a puckish<br />\nexpression and replaced the<br />\nfigurine in the cabinet.<br />\n<br />\nSo much for the preliminary<br />\nbackdrop for the drama that our<br />\nbeloved Dr. Robinson enacted.<br />\nThe year was 1939. The<br />\nmountebank, \"Wooden Titan,\"<br />\nBenito Mussolini, the Chief of<br />\nthe hideous Fascist system,<br />\nwithout cause, and dreaming of<br />\nFascist Italian imperial conquest,<br />\nhurled his German-trained divisions of infantry against the<br />\nhalf-naked, bare-footed Ethiopian (Abbysinian) native troops.<br />\nThis creature, Mussolini,<br />\neven went so far as to send<br />\nbombing aircraft over the roads<br />\nused by the half-naked, barefoot, retreating Abbysinian<br />\n(Ethiopian) Army, to drench<br />\nthem with liquid mustard gas,<br />\n(brombenz yecyankle), a bar-<br />\n<br />\nbaric and inhuman act unparalleled in history up to that<br />\ntime. This gas is a fatal vesicant<br />\nas well as a fatal lung-irritant,<br />\nagainst which the Ethiopian<br />\nnative troops had no means of<br />\nprotection. These native troops<br />\ndid their best, trying to stand to<br />\ndefend their capital, Addis<br />\nAbaba, and their Emperor, in<br />\nwhom they then believed, Haile<br />\nSelassie.<br />\nBut this is enough of<br />\ncommentary on the Fascist,<br />\nItalian attack on Ethiopia. The<br />\nmain theme of this memoir<br />\nconcerns Dr. Robinson and his<br />\npuckish humor. The morning<br />\nafter the fall of Addis Ababa,he<br />\nappeared in the Classics Seminar<br />\nRoom displaying that tell-tale<br />\n<br />\n\"Why. she went to sell<br />\ntwinkle in his large blue eyes,<br />\nand a trace of a smirkish smile ass-jet\"<br />\nThere was a dead silence.<br />\nabout his handsome face.<br />\nThen one of the students<br />\nThe graduate students, in- snickered; others began to<br />\ncluding two teaching nuns, laugh;the class burst into a gale<br />\nbraced for one of the good of laughter--less the two nuns,<br />\nprofessor's quips. Dr. Robinson who blushed.<br />\nput down his papers and notes<br />\nProfessor<br />\nThe<br />\naugust<br />\non the lectern, and then grinned beamed at us, and laughed at his<br />\nat us all. Then, he said in his own joke; he then calmly and<br />\nhigh, and slightly squeaky voice: quietly began his lecture.<br />\n\"Good morning. By the<br />\nIt is too bad that we do not<br />\nway, do you know why Mae have more Dr. David Moore<br />\nWest went to Addis Ababa?\" Robinsons.<br />\nThe class remained silent.<br />\nSome of us shook our heads.

This<br />\nblanket distrust is the cornerstone of military wisdom.<br />\nIn my wargaming days (how anyone finds the<br />\ntime at Hopkins is beyond me), I preferred multiplayer games with the element of diplomacy, because<br />\nhuman interaction became a crucial factor in the game.<br />\nStill, the rule held: \"you can't trust anyone.\" What<br />\nkind of diplomatic settlement can be reached when the<br />\nrulebook commands you to conquer the world or not<br />\nbother playing? Did the game provoke the personal<br />\narguments, and even fistfights, that I've seen at wargame<br />\n<br />\ntables, or did it just reveal sublimated anger and enmities?<br />\nIf these concepts underlie the wargames, why is<br />\nit that pacifists often turn up among the ranks of Young<br />\nRepublicans and even fascists at game tables? I have<br />\noften seen shouldei-length hair held in an Indian headband among the close-cropped heads of the gamers,or a<br />\nfaded dashiki amid the pastel button-downs. What do<br />\nthe games offer them?<br />\nI knew an electrical engineer who designed<br />\ncomputer wargames of World War III for the Pentagon<br />\nofficers to practice on. He hated working for them,<br />\nlooking upon their activities as dangerous in the ex-<br />\n<br />\ntreme, but he loved to play wargames in the dorm snack<br />\nbar every chance he got.<br />\nI knew a tennis player who had never heard of<br />\nwargames. One afternoon, I taught him the rules to one<br />\nand we played a game. That was the last time I saw him<br />\nfor more than a year. When I finally visited him, he was<br />\nworking on his chain-mail hauberk for the Maryland<br />\nMedieval Militia, cutting quarter-inch circlets from a<br />\nsteel coil and twisting them together with pliers. His<br />\nping-pong table was covered with painted miniatures,<br />\nand he had a tottering stack of Avalon Hill games under<br />\nthe table.<br />\nWargames deliver the goods. They combine the<br />\nchallenging mental exercises of chess with the imaginative role-playing of children's games (I pretty much gave<br />\nup wargaming when I became involved in acting\u2014a<br />\nsuitable substitute\u2014in high school). They are genre<br />\nsuspense novels in which the characters take an active<br />\npart. But is it necessary to deliver these goods in such<br />\na violent, distrustful context?<br />\nThe solution would be to design games that<br />\ncombine mental challenge and role-playing within<br />\na cooperative atmosphere. There are some political and<br />\neconomic games, and more sports games (but why not<br />\nplay the sports themselves?) that do this, but there is<br />\nstill a long way to go when The Lord of the Rings, a<br />\nbook that shows the horrors of agressive militarism,<br />\nbecomes a game favoring agressive militarism (D & D),<br />\nand the TV series Star Trek,a show denouncing military<br />\nsolutions, becomes a game resolved only through superior military force and strategy (Star Fleet Battles).<br />\nVIOLENCE EDUCATION<br />\nOne school of pacifist thought blames our<br />\nwarlike attitudes on the prevalence of militarism in our<br />\nenvironment. Nevertheless, once militarism has infiltrated our daily lives through the media, or, more<br />\nto our interest here, through the hobby of wargaming,<br />\nthe more we know about the realities of war,<br />\nthe<br />\n<br />\n\fFRIENDS?<br />\n<br />\nid Harris Gruman<br />\n<br />\nle story straightfrom the front.<br />\n<br />\nLrgamers tell all.<br />\nwhich can be described as the Frustrated Adolescent<br />\nIntellectual. American society creates individuals to<br />\nconform to its own stereotypes by pigeonholing them<br />\ninto stereotypical social roles, and peer pressure social<br />\ncontrols force the individual to conform to these types.<br />\nIn junior high school and high school, one prominent<br />\nstereotype is the Frustrated Adolescent Intellectual<br />\n-intelligent, unathletic,socially immature,and something<br />\nof a loner. This individual is constantly seeking a social<br />\ngroup in which he can be accepted but does not have to<br />\nmake any intellectual concessions of his character. D &<br />\nD is a natural magnet for this person. It is to a large<br />\ndegree a social activity, but it also provides an outlet for<br />\nhis frustrated intellect.<br />\nANOTHER SATURDAY NIGHT<br />\nWITH THE D & D BOYS<br />\ndeep player, the entire week is centered<br />\nthe<br />\nFor<br />\naround the weekends gaming.

While Milgut<br />\n(as it is called) gives the student a firsthand understanding of the present American military mentality, it lacks<br />\nthe scope necessary to understand this fundamental<br />\naspect of human experience and history. A Humanities<br />\nArea course, drawing its sources from an interdisciplinary range, could offer the students a fuller understanding<br />\nof the human and social dynamics as well as the potential dangers of war. Each instructor would have his or<br />\nher own focus, but here is a suggested booklist:<br />\nThe Face ofBattle by John Keegan<br />\nA Social History of the Machine Gun by John Ellis<br />\nWar Against War by Ernst Friedrich<br />\nAll Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque<br />\nMilitarism and Anti-militarism by Karl Liebknecht<br />\nThe Naked and the Dead by Norman Mailer<br />\nCatch-22 by Joseph Heller<br />\nThree Faces ofFascism by Ernst Nolte<br />\nJohnny Got His Gun by Dalton Trumbo<br />\nLevel 7 by Mordecai Roshwald<br />\nThese works would raise important questions for discussion--questions that would never be raised in a<br />\nwargame.<br />\n<br />\nend until the wee hours of the morning. D & D is<br />\nstructured so that it is impossible to play for a shorter<br />\nlength of time than a few hours, but the deep player<br />\nallows The Game to consume Friday night, Saturday,<br />\nand sometimes Sunday.<br />\nI have no criticism of wasting a few hours per<br />\nweek on gaming. There is nothing wrong with frittering<br />\naway a handful of hours on The Game, but there is an<br />\narbitrary boundary of reason which one or two entire<br />\ndays oversteps. And what is the final product? Nothing<br />\nsubstantial except for the end, is justified for a few<br />\nhours of leisure-time for the sake of pleasure alone, but<br />\none can spend too much time on it ...<br />\nThe paradox of The Game is that an enormous<br />\namount of time, creativity, writer's cramp,and thought<br />\nis injected into the creation by the referee (termed<br />\n\"Dungeonmaster\") of the fantasy world in which the<br />\nother players will adventure, but more time is put into<br />\nthe creation of the world than the actual play in it. To<br />\ncompound matters, the elaborate scenario created by the<br />\nDungeonmaster is wasted for the most part once it has<br />\nbeen played in. The Dungeonmaster is in charge of<br />\nconstructing and populating entire towns, vast stretches<br />\nof wilderness, and detailed underground labyrinths.<br />\nNaturally, he does not include every stone, tree, floorboard, and windowpane in his design, but an enormous<br />\namount of work goes into this process nonetheless.<br />\nAfter a certain point, one wonders why the Dungeonmaster doesn't just write his own fantasy novel and<br />\nforget The Game. A novel would be infinitely more<br />\nsatisfying (for he would be in control of the situation,<br />\nnot the players), and without a doubt it would be more<br />\nlasting. Once the players have entered the world created<br />\nby the Dungeonmaster, many parts of it become too<br />\nfamiliar or serve their purpose and cannot be reused.<br />\nThis means that the haggard Dungeonmaster must go<br />\nback and rework most portions of his world all over<br />\nagain... Once again, there is an ambiguous but extant<br />\nlimit of reason where the amount of imput does not<br />\njustify the final product.<br />\nGUT-SPILLING ACTION!!!<br />\nThe light player is intellectually aloof from The<br />\nGame; the deep player is so caught up in The Game that<br />\nhe must make some philosophical concessions in order<br />\nto survive. The most important lesson to learn in order<br />\nto escape (imaginary) death is that violence is a common, utilitarian, and often desirable solution to one's<br />\nproblems. Is there a foul-smelling, warty ogre standing<br />\nin your way? Hack it down! Show it no mercy! It was<br />\ncreated to be your opponent, and it must therefore fall<br />\nto your trusty blade! The majority of the rules of The<br />\nGame is a simulation of violence--an elaborate combat<br />\nsystem, magic both constructive and destructive, and a<br />\nplethora of monsters which are described, not as beings<br />\nwith cultures or personalities, but as a list of numbers<br />\nindicating how difficult they areto kill all make violence<br />\nthe centerpiece of The Game. There are very few<br />\nnon-violent rules in The Game, and to make matters<br />\nbloodier the only route for the advancement of the<br />\nplayer's characters is the killing of opponent after<br />\nopponent and the acquisition of large amounts of<br />\nwealth. In order to advance (or \"go up a level\" in<br />\nGamespeak), one cannot just subdue an opponent--you<br />\nmust kill it! There is no reward for cleverness or mercy,<br />\nbut for the bloodthirsty and the greedy there are benefits galore! One can attempt to play The Game without<br />\nsuch a materialistic/militaristic attitude, but it is nearly<br />\nimpossible to overcome these predetermined biases in<br />\nthe rules. Except for a few exceptions, the Game collapses into Social Darwinism in the trappings of heroic<br />\nfantasy. Nice guys really do finish last, and another<br />\nblow is struck for psychological egoism!<br />\nThe most stunning effect of the D & D mentality<br />\nis the transmogrification of Walter Mitty types in the<br />\nactuality of their fantasies. The most quiet, amiable<br />\nperson is transformed into a feral-eyed barbarian,eagerly<br />\nhefting his battleaxe, snarling at the beserk goblin<br />\ncharging toward him,\"There ain't no way you're getting<br />\npast ME, sucker!\" Such courage! Such balls! Such<br />\nstrength of arms!<br />\nFine and dandy, but I believe human beings have<br />\nmatured ethically since the Dark Ages. Chivalry has been<br />\nshown for the sham it was,and now the Western world is<br />\n(hopefully) more enlightened.<br />\nSIR HEMINGWAY<br />\nThe typical D & D personality is a species which<br />\nclosely resembles the American male ideal exemplified<br />\nby the Hemingway hero and what Tom Wolfe called the<br />\nfollowers of The Right Stuff. The idea is to be ballsy,<br />\nswaggering when you walk, endowed with a determination never to be pushed around by anyone,and possessing the ability to remain level-headed in dangerous<br />\nsituations. Cool courage! Machismo! Power! These are<br />\nthe real rules of the game, not explicitly stated in the<br />\nD & D books but tacitly consented to by the players.<br />\nThere is no real ethical involvement, and one is not<br />\nreally putting lne's life on the line. Killed by an angry<br />\n<br />\nmob which is irate at your slaughter of innocent, defenseless villagers? Death means crumpling a piece of<br />\npaper and tossing it in the trash. No pain! No retribution for your actions, for your behavior is just as unreal<br />\nas your death! Wreak all the carnage you want, for no<br />\none can stop you! Prove yourself to be the better man,<br />\nno matter what the price!<br />\nAccording to paleoanthropology, one of the<br />\nmajor factors which contributed to the ascension of<br />\nthe human species as the dominant species on earth was<br />\ncooperation. Cooperation was an important factor in<br />\nprehistoric times, and it is an important ethic in day-today life today. Ironically, D & D allegedly a life simulation (with fantastical elements here and there) almost<br />\nprides itself on a competition ethic.<br />\nThe end result is that D & D creates an experiential tunnel vision for the deep player. It is impossible<br />\nto simulate a shy smile, the caress of a lover's hand, the<br />\nexuberance of science, the warm flush of friendliness,<br />\nthe fervor of painting, or any other experience which we<br />\nvalue highly. What D & D can simulate is a love of<br />\nconflict, callousness towards violence, avariciousness,<br />\nand a desire for vengeance. A light player can enter this<br />\nrole-playing psychosis without being affected; for the<br />\ndeep player, it can become the dominant perspective on<br />\nlife and an entirely new set of ethical considerations.<br />\nA REAL-LIVE ELF!<br />\nThe relationship between a player and his character is strangely ambivalent. The character has no<br />\nobjective reality, so if it is killed, nothing is lost in a<br />\nmaterial sense. The character has a social reality as an<br />\nitem of prestige, though, so its loss can mean a drop in<br />\nthe status ladder of the D & D group. D & D is, after all,<br />\na process of interaction between individuals, so it is<br />\ninevitable that it is a social activity, with the characters<br />\nacting as reference points. If you somehow manage to<br />\ndevelop a relatively powerful character, then your<br />\nformidability in social reality as well as in D & D<br />\n\"reality\" is increased. Characters are markers of achievement: the higher the character advances (and,to a lesser<br />\ndegree, the more interesting the personality of the<br />\ncharacter), the higher the status of the individual behind<br />\nthe character. Thus, although superficially it may seem<br />\nthat there is no attachment to a character, a great<br />\namount of psychological import is placed upon the<br />\ncharacter as a vector -within the social network of the<br />\nweekend D & D group. Once again, the deeper the<br />\nplayer, the more catastrophic the consequences...<br />\nTHE CHARYBDIS OF CASH<br />\nOnce involved in D & D, it is difficult to avoid<br />\ntoppling into the vortex of extra items. Aside from the<br />\nrulebooks, paper, dice, and pencils, there is a universe of<br />\nother items to buy. I have dice, but I could always use<br />\nmore... If I don't buy this set of supplementary rules, I<br />\nwill fall behind everyone else... Christ, I don't have any<br />\nelf miniatures, and here are some interesting minotaur<br />\nfigures, and here's an interesting dragon,and I could use<br />\nsome more dwarves... Not only does D & D have the<br />\npotential for great psychological involvement for the<br />\ndeep player, but it coincides with an equal potential for<br />\nmonetary involvement. Rules! Miniatures! Dice! More<br />\nrules! Game aids! More miniatures! Everything the<br />\nproper D & D player should have!<br />\nA BLOW WHICH BITES DEEPER<br />\nknow of is an<br />\nThe greatest tragedy of deep play I<br />\n<br />\n\fJANUARY 30, 1981 / PAGE 14<br />\n<br />\nt4t,4714<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\n4WtAt<br />\n,<br />\nCLIP AND SAVE<br />\n<br />\n4)<br />\nVO<br />\nTE<br />\ni<br />\n*<br />\nTUESDAY )<br />\n.1e<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\nREFERENDUM<br />\nON NEXT YEAR'S<br />\n<br />\nMSE<br />\n&SYMPOSIUM<br />\nWILL BE HELD IN THE<br />\nGILMAN<br />\nCOFFEE SHOP<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nCLIP AND SAVE<br />\n<br />\nRATHSKELLAR SCHEDULE<br />\nSPRING SEMESTER<br />\nFriday Jan.30<br />\nSaturday Jan.31<br />\nThursday Feb.5<br />\nFriday Feb.6<br />\nSaturday Feb.7<br />\nThursday Feb.12<br />\nFriday Feb.13<br />\nSaturday Feb.14<br />\nThursday Feb.19<br />\nFriday Feb.20<br />\nSaturday Feb.21<br />\nThursday Feb.26<br />\nFriday Feb.27<br />\nSaturday Feb.28<br />\nThursday Mar.5<br />\nFriday Mar.6<br />\nSaturday Mar.7<br />\nThursday Mar.12<br />\nFriday Mar.13<br />\nSaturday Mar.14<br />\nThursday Mar.19<br />\nCLIP AND SAVE<br />\n<br />\nRock D.J.<br />\nTangent<br />\nOff TheWall<br />\nIndustrial Dance Band<br />\nDisco<br />\nDisco<br />\nPoetic Justice<br />\nTBA<br />\nJames Offie<br />\nMichael Hedges<br />\nDisco<br />\nJoanne Dodds Band<br />\nLarry & Phil<br />\nDisco<br />\nDisco<br />\nStage Coach<br />\nJust Friends<br />\nZen Archer<br />\nDisco<br />\nOpen Road<br />\nOff The Wall<br />\nCLIP AND SAVE<br />\n<br />\nMerryman Hall<br />\n<br />\nThe PLACEMENT BUREAU<br />\n<br />\nFROM 1 OAM T\u00b01 OPM<br />\nNEXT TUESDAY,<br />\nFEBRUARY 3.<br />\nVOLUNTEERS ARE NEEDED TO WORK<br />\nAT THE POLLS.CONTACT MITCHELL<br />\nSMITH AT 366-5943,BOX 844,<br />\nOR THE STUDENT COUNCIL OFFICE<br />\n<br />\n2/2/81<br />\n2/2/81<br />\n2/3/81<br />\n2/3/81<br />\n2/4/81<br />\n2/4/81<br />\n2/5/81<br />\n2/5/81<br />\n2/5/81<br />\n2/6/81<br />\n2/6/81<br />\n2/9/81<br />\n2/9/81<br />\n2/10/81<br />\n2/10/81<br />\n2/10/81<br />\n2/11/81<br />\n2/11/81<br />\n2/12/81<br />\n2/12/81<br />\n2/13/81<br />\n2/13/81<br />\n<br />\nNaval Surface Weapons Center<br />\nNaval Civilian Personnel Command<br />\nScience Applications<br />\nWarner Robins Air Logistics Center<br />\nGeneral Electric<br />\nNational Security Agency<br />\nGoddard Space Flight Center<br />\nJohnson Controls<br />\nDept. of the Army - Harry Diamond Labs<br />\nAir Force Recruiting Office<br />\nFirst National Bank<br />\nBendix Communications Division<br />\nBureau of Engraving<br />\nAAI Corporation<br />\nKoppers Company<br />\nI IT Research Institute<br />\nApplied Physics Laboratory<br />\nHewlett Packard<br />\nHewlett Packard<br />\nWestinghouse Electric Corporation<br />\nIBM Corporation<br />\nNaval Air Test Center<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 15<br />\n<br />\nMister Friedman Goes To Washington<br />\nBY ROB FRIEDMAN<br />\nA friend invited me to escort her to one of the<br />\nnine Inaugural balls in Washington the evening of<br />\nRonald Reagan's ascendency to the throne.

So when Elvis took the<br />\nstage, it was up to him alone to deliver<br />\nthe unfamiliar material in less than<br />\nfavorable circumstances. And, true to<br />\nform, Elvis did the job--with verve, wit,<br />\nand even a few well-placed snarls.<br />\nLove, that untrustworthy old<br />\nstalwart, makes its tortured reappearance<br />\nin the new songs. Elvis played seven<br />\nsongs from Trust,and if the lyrics are any<br />\nindication, the anger of This Year's Model<br />\nis back with a dangerous new twist: Elvis<br />\nhas it under control. \"Black Sails in the<br />\nSunset\", \"Big Sister's Clothes\", and<br />\nparticularly \"Lovers Walk\" go back to the<br />\nold 1-got-b urned-and-now -watch -me-fume<br />\npose, but the delivery was different<br />\nhere--Elvis was at his most mannered,<br />\n<br />\nstrutting to and fro, peering coyly<br />\nthrough rose-colored glasses (!) and<br />\nnurturing each new hurt as if it were<br />\nanother gimmick in his bag of tricks:<br />\na New Wave Sinatra.<br />\nThe mannered delivery, in fact,<br />\nhighlighted the show. On the slower<br />\nnumbers, like \"Secondary Modern\",<br />\n\"Clowntime\", and an old R & B weeper<br />\ncalled \"I Got Your Memory\", Elvis<br />\nlooked for all the world like some blueeyed soul crooner, clutching and sighing<br />\nin all the right places, heaving his<br />\nshoulders, and reeling off lyrics as if it<br />\nwere unpleasant to go through tortured<br />\nlove. What a change from the jerk who<br />\nwailed \"my aim is true.\"<br />\nThe price of this panache, sadly, is<br />\nthe emotion that marked the earlier<br />\nalbums and shows. \"Accidents Will<br />\nHappen\" and \"Temptation\" were messy<br />\nand unemotive, the antithesis of the early<br />\nCostello. The Attractions, themselves as<br />\ntight as ever, were joined by a big goon<br />\nnamed Monty Belmont on guitar; his<br />\nstage presence was forced, awkward, and<br />\ndidn't serve to rev up the band--if that's<br />\nall those grimaces and leaps and stupid<br />\nexpressions were supposed to do. Elvis<br />\nknew it, too--he was hiding behind his.<br />\nown veneer and the shouted \"Can you<br />\n<br />\nhear me?\" at the end of \"High Fidelity\"<br />\nmay have been a cry from the heart.<br />\nAll that pretense was dropped,<br />\nthough, in two solid encores. All the<br />\nstandards, like \"Pump It Up\" and<br />\n\"Oliver's Army,\" ran fast and smooth,<br />\nwith Elvis trading guitar fills against Steve<br />\nNaive's bouncing, complex keyboards.<br />\n\"Watching The Detectives\" even featured<br />\na quick change into--surprise--Stevie<br />\nWonder's \"Master Blaster\".<br />\nIf Elvis has put more space<br />\nbetween himself and all those rotten<br />\n<br />\nemotions about which he writes so well,<br />\nthe net gain is a man with more control<br />\nover his feeling\u2014someone you can trust.<br />\nOpening the night was Squeeze,<br />\nthe much-touted British band.

This is no<br />\nallegory, but an honest and poetic recording of a failed pilgrimage. The humor<br />\nhere is not as black and cruel as in<br />\nHerzog's other films, but equally memorable in its very personal cynicism.

His performance,<br />\na mixture of the gruffness of old age, and<br />\nthe helpless confusion of infancy, is<br />\ncaptivating in its coarseness and total<br />\nlack of self-consciousness. The authenticity of Bruno's growing disgust with an<br />\n<br />\nKlaus Kinski as the power-crazed Aguirre<br />\noppressive, stagnant culture, which he<br />\nexpresses in eccentric grunts and<br />\ntwitches, adds to the documentary<br />\nflavor of the film.

The foil begain as a<br />\nlightweight practice weapon for<br />\nwarmups before epee duels.<br />\n\"You'd expect a challenge, practice up with the lighter foil, and<br />\ngo get him,\" says Oles.

The new<br />\nrules, set to go into effect<br />\nFebruary 1, prohibit owners<br />\nfrom bringing their dogs inside<br />\nany campus building, allowing<br />\ndogs to run loose around the<br />\ncampus, or leaving dogs tied to<br />\ntrees or buildings.<br />\nThe rules have met with<br />\nsome controversy as students<br />\ncomplained of exclusion from<br />\nthe decision-making process.<br />\nThis week,junior Ellen H.

The signers questioned<br />\nthe appropriateness of exclusing<br />\nstudents in a decision that<br />\nmostly affects students, alleging<br />\nthat those in favor of letting<br />\ndogs on campus were ignored.<br />\nKavee asserts that many students<br />\nare in favor of letting the dogs<br /><br />\nstay as they are, pointing to a<br />\nsurvey taken last year that<br />\nshowed 58% of the student body<br />\nlike having the dogs on campus.<br />\nother<br />\nconsulted<br />\nOwen<br />\ndeans, members of the administration, and faculty members in<br />\nmaking his decision, according<br />\nto Jakie Hall, Associate Dean of<br />\nHomewood Faculties. \"I was<br />\nconsulted, and I know he made<br />\nthe decision carefully,\" Hall<br />\nsaid, describing the rules as<br />\n\"not aimed against people who<br />\nlove pets,\"but rather as a way<br />\nto alleviate the problems caused<br />\nby the dogs on campus.<br />\nRobert<br />\nchief<br />\nSecurity<br />\nLarkin said that enforcement of<br />\nthe rules \"may be a problem,<br />\nbut we're looking more for<br />\ncooperation from the faculty<br />\nand students.\" For this reason,<br />\nLarkin explained, enforcement<br />\nof the new rules will be delayed<br />\nuntil the students and faculty<br />\nare familiar with them.<br />\nWilliam Campbell, Director<br />\nof University Plant Planning,<br />\ndiscussed the problems that<br /><br />\nhave been caused by letting dogs<br />\nrun freely.

Back in October, this<br />\nseemed a poor choice, especially since so<br />\nmany other options were then open. But<br />\nthe options have since closed.

As members of the<br />\nGraduate Women's Committee,<br />\nwe are also very concerned with<br />\nuniversity policies regarding<br />\nhiring, promotion, and tenure<br />\ndecisions. Since these policies<br />\ndetermine the composition of<br />\nthe Hopkins faculty, both undergraduate and graduate students<br />\nhave a vested interest in analyzing the fairness and consequences of current university<br />\nprocedures. The quality of our<br />\neducational experience is compromised each time a promising<br />\nwoman, minority, or politically<br />\n\"deviant\" scholar leaves the<br />\nHopkins community. We hope<br />\nthat the recent News-Letter<br />\narticle will help to focus university-wide attention to this difficult and complex problem.<br /><br />\nhiring and promoting women<br />\nand minority faculty members.<br />\nIn terms of the fairness of<br />\nexisting pruclures, we agree<br />\nwith the News-Letter that departmental standards of acceptable scholarship and concerns<br />\nwith collegiality are important<br />\nsubjective factors in the decision-making process.

May I preface my protest<br />\nwith the statement that Levering<br />\nHall, an institution comparable<br />\nto what is generally called \"The<br />\nStudents' Union\" in other universities and colleges, was made<br />\npossible by the generous public<br />\nspirit of Mr. Joshua Levering, a<br />\nscion of a great and old Maryland family, who intended it to<br />\nserve the needs, comfort, and<br />\nsocial requirements of all students and faculty, regardless<br />\nof financial means and affluence.<br />\nSo much for historical reflections. During the past year<br />\nand a half, the charge for a small<br />\nglass of beer has risen arbitrarily<br />\nfrom 30 cents to 50 cents. Two<br />\nweeks ago, it was forty cents \u2014<br />\nnow the concessionaires have<br />\nraised the price by 06 2/3<br />\npercent. Even the ever touted<br />\ncry of \"inflation\", so often used<br />\nas an excuse for raising prices<br />\nin order to gain exhorbitant<br />\nprofit, to satisfy the fourth of<br />\nthe seven Biblical deadly' sins-greed\u2014at the expense of students and faculty. There is no<br />\nvalid excuse for this creeping,<br />\narbitrary gouging of the patrons<br />\nof Levering Hall, especially since<br />\nthe function of Levering Hall is<br />\nto serve, not gouge, the student<br />\nbody and faculty.<br />\nYesterday, I ordered a plain<br />\nham sandwich for my lunch.<br />\nAfter paying 50 cents for<br />\na small paper cup of beer, the<br />\nattendant at the cash register<br />\ncharged me $1.25 for a meagre<br />\nlittle sandwich, made from two<br />\nslices of bread cut from the<br />\nsmallest, skimpiest loaf that<br />\ncommercial bakers sell.

Martin<br />\nLuther King Jr., \"I have a<br />\ndream,that one day...\"<br />\nIf Hopkins is any reflection<br />\nof our country's future, as much<br />\nas I regret it, I can honestly<br />\nsay I expect few are going to<br />\ngive a damn about blacks, the<br />\npoor, the handicapped, or anyone else who isn't one of \"us\".<br />\nSorry Reverend.<br /><br />\nham was so thin that I could<br />\nalmost read my book through it.<br />\nI wondered what the great and<br />\ngenerous Mr. Levering would<br />\nthink if he were alive and knew<br />\nof this profiteering in the place<br />\nthat was his gift to all of us.<br />\nI must stop this tirade. But,<br />\nbefore I do so, I propose a<br />\nwager, that sixpence against<br />\na shilling, the concessionaires<br />\nraise Leer prices to 60 cents<br />\nbefore next June. Any takers?<br />\nIf you have space, Mr.<br />\nEditor, please publish this letter.<br />\nNot that I wish publicity.<br />\nBut if enough of us made<br />\nsufficiently sustained protest<br />\nagainst this price racket, perhaps<br />\nit might be curbed.<br />\nIf you find it is unsuitable<br />\nfor publication in the NewsLetter, please return it to<br />\nme, and I shall try the Johns<br />\nHopkins Magazine and/or the<br />\nBaltimore Sun. This is probably<br />\ncrying in the<br />\nvoice<br />\n\"a<br />\nwilderness,\" as is recorded in the<br />\nOld Testament\u2014but it is a<br />\nvoice, nonetheless. Let us hope<br />\nthat our Levering Hall does not<br />\ncontinue to be a wilderness<br />\nof greedy profiteers.<br /><br />\nexcept within a certain clique of<br />\nfriends. In short, the students<br />\nare habituating themselves to<br />\nbeing governed without participating and controlled without<br />\nstopping to ask why. A dangerous precedent to set. It is for<br />\nthis reason that a few of us are<br />\nattempting to re-create a student<br />\npowered and oriented political<br />\nforce at Hopkins. Though we<br />\nhave no official name, or many<br />\nmembers, we believe this group<br />\nholds the potential of emerging<br />\nas a truly unified and cohesive<br />\nforce in the Hopkins community,<br />\none which actually 'holds goals<br />\nand ideals, and is willing to<br />\nwork towards them.<br /><br />\nThe groups presently willing<br />\nto question the established<br />\norders have become too diffused<br />\nand splintered to exercise any<br />\npolitical power. The students<br />\nhave allowed the right, spearheaded by the moral majority<br />\nand other such reactionary pressure groups, to dominate political activity with their money<br />\nand zealousness, thus confusing<br />\nprivate decisions with the law of<br />\nthe state, and casting aside the<br />\nOnce<br />\nrights of individuals.<br />\nwith<br />\nre-unite<br />\nmust<br />\nleft<br />\nthe<br />\nagain,<br />\nRespectfully and sincerely,<br />\nand<br />\nre-emerge<br />\ngoal,<br />\ncommon<br />\none<br />\nPhD.<br />\n1936,<br />\nAn Old Grad, A.B.<br />\nwith enthusiasm and organiza1940.<br />\ntion to combine hopes of a<br />\nA New Political Order humanistic society with the<br />\nprinciples of democratic government.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe political vision of students has died. Students are<br />\npreparing themselves for later<br />\nlife, not by learning to make<br />\ndecisions or work towards ideals,<br />\nbut by either throwing themselves into endless academia and<br />\ncommitting themselves to overintensified grade competition or<br />\nby simply ignoring all parts of<br />\nthe world that do not exist<br /><br />\nOur ideal is simple: power<br />\nto the students. The students<br />\nmust begin to explore and<br />\nexamine their own plans and<br />\npotentials for action.<br />\nThe<br />\nuniversity should no longer serve<br />\nas a substitute parent in academic and legal areas--enforcing laws<br />\nand regulations that the students<br />\nobviously oppose or could do<br />\nwithout. Instead, the university<br /><br />\nshould be the one safe domain<br />\nfor students: a place to harbor<br />\nthose youths who care to<br />\neducate themselves and a place<br />\nwhere students should learn to<br />\ncreate and follow their own<br />\nThe students need to<br />\nrules.<br />\ncontrol their own domain--the<br />\nuniversity--as well as functioning<br />\non the national level as a visible<br />\npolitical force.<br />\nThe supposed power groups<br />\nof the students have become too<br />\nentrenched to be questioned<br />\nfrom the outside as institutions<br />\nand too intricate for most<br />\nstudents to know how to exercise their own power. The<br />\npowers of the S.C. grant it the<br />\nability to claim that indeed the<br />\nstudents hold power, yet only a<br />\nhandful of students know what<br />\npower the S.C. holds and even<br />\nfewer can gain access to it.<br />\nIf the vast majority of the<br />\nstudent body is kept ignorant of<br />\nthe assorted powers of the S.C.,<br />\nthen how can the students be<br />\nsaid to hold power, much less<br />\n,exercise it?<br />\nApathy, joined by pessimism and doubt has ruled too<br />\nlong. Apathy begets apathy,and<br />\nwe feel it is time for action and<br />\nenthusiasm to break the chain.<br />\nThis explains why we do not<br />\nbelieve it necessary for all who<br />\njoin to be able to express concretely defined political views--as<br />\nstudents, not sages, we can<br />\nhardly be expected to hold<br />\nRather, joining will<br />\nthem.<br />\nrepresent an urge to break<br />\nthrough the crust of apathy that<br />\nstifles Hopkins: a desire to<br />\nspeak#and be heard; a wish to<br />\nbring power and responsibility<br />\nto the students; a hope to listen<br />\nto and learn from the speakings<br />\nof others.<br /><br />\nbroad ideas. The specifics can<br />\nonly come later--once the students have gotten together to<br />\ndiscuss and share views. For<br />\nthis, in such a small community,<br />\nis the only source from which<br />\nthe specifics should spring--not<br />\nfrom a few politicos who have<br />\nlost all practical significance to<br />\nstudents.

Box 814, or call Emily<br />\nHauptmann at 467-3254.

Long dead now, his memory remains in my heart and<br />\nmind. I had the privilege of<br />\nstudying Greek History and<br />\nLiterature under him. It was a<br />\nunique experience, and one I<br />\nstill cherish warmly despite my<br />\n74 years of life.<br />\nDavid Moore Robinson was<br />\na great scholar, teacher, and<br />\nauthor. His scholarly publications are legion; his standing and<br />\nrecognition in the world of<br />\nacademe, as well as in the public<br />\nat large remain a monument to<br />\nhis scholarly and intellectual<br />\nattainments.<br />\nDr. Robinson was also a<br />\nvery<br />\ncharming<br />\npersonality.<br />\nShort, chubby, healthily redfaced, he used to beam out over<br />\nthe podium in the Classics<br />\nDepartment Seminar Room with<br />\na puckish gleam of humor.<br />\nHe also, God forgive me for<br />\nrecording it, had quite a marked<br />\nbawdy streak in his august<br />\nHe delighted in<br />\npersonality.<br />\nquips that were distinctly risque<br />\nand earth-earthy.<br />\nI recall vividly, although it<br />\nhas been nearly 40 years ago,<br />\nwhen he took his graduate class<br />\nin Greek History to the Walters<br />\nGallery of Art, where he was a<br />\nTrustee and had keys to the<br />\nlocked, exhibition cabinets. He<br />\nopened one of these cabinets<br />\nand took out carefully an<br />\nexquisite figurine of a young<br />\nGreek woman, quite lovely in<br />\nher alabaster beauty. I believe<br />\nthat the artist was a student of<br />\nPraxitiles, although my daily<br />\njournal, a diary that I kept,<br />\nwhich makes possible this memoir of Dr. Robinson, does not<br />\nconfirm the artist who made the<br />\nfigurine. Regardless, it was an<br />\nexquisite example of early Greek<br />\nminiature sculpture. Undraped,<br />\nthe artist had achieved a compelling replica of her female form.<br />\nDr. Robinson held the figurine up and discussed the artist's<br />\ntechnique and in recreating her<br />\nfemale beauty.<br />\nThen the august Professor<br />\ngently caressed the figure with<br />\nhis chubby hands, and with a<br />\nsort of smirking smile, said:<br />\n\"And, she has such lovely<br />\ntits,\" and gently rubbed his<br />\nthumb and forefinger over the<br />\nstatuette's lovely curved breasts.<br />\nThere was a dead silence<br />\nafter this; there were two<br />\nwimpled Nuns of a teaching<br />\norder in the class. They blushed<br />\nlike American Beauty roses in<br />\nJune. But our Dr. Robinson<br />\nmerely grinned with a puckish<br />\nexpression and replaced the<br />\nfigurine in the cabinet.<br /><br />\nSo much for the preliminary<br />\nbackdrop for the drama that our<br />\nbeloved Dr. Robinson enacted.<br />\nThe year was 1939. The<br />\nmountebank, \"Wooden Titan,\"<br />\nBenito Mussolini, the Chief of<br />\nthe hideous Fascist system,<br />\nwithout cause, and dreaming of<br />\nFascist Italian imperial conquest,<br />\nhurled his German-trained divisions of infantry against the<br />\nhalf-naked, bare-footed Ethiopian (Abbysinian) native troops.<br />\nThis creature, Mussolini,<br />\neven went so far as to send<br />\nbombing aircraft over the roads<br />\nused by the half-naked, barefoot, retreating Abbysinian<br />\n(Ethiopian) Army, to drench<br />\nthem with liquid mustard gas,<br />\n(brombenz yecyankle), a bar-<br /><br />\nbaric and inhuman act unparalleled in history up to that<br />\ntime. This gas is a fatal vesicant<br />\nas well as a fatal lung-irritant,<br />\nagainst which the Ethiopian<br />\nnative troops had no means of<br />\nprotection. These native troops<br />\ndid their best, trying to stand to<br />\ndefend their capital, Addis<br />\nAbaba, and their Emperor, in<br />\nwhom they then believed, Haile<br />\nSelassie.<br />\nBut this is enough of<br />\ncommentary on the Fascist,<br />\nItalian attack on Ethiopia. The<br />\nmain theme of this memoir<br />\nconcerns Dr. Robinson and his<br />\npuckish humor. The morning<br />\nafter the fall of Addis Ababa,he<br />\nappeared in the Classics Seminar<br />\nRoom displaying that tell-tale<br /><br />\n\"Why. she went to sell<br />\ntwinkle in his large blue eyes,<br />\nand a trace of a smirkish smile ass-jet\"<br />\nThere was a dead silence.<br />\nabout his handsome face.<br />\nThen one of the students<br />\nThe graduate students, in- snickered; others began to<br />\ncluding two teaching nuns, laugh;the class burst into a gale<br />\nbraced for one of the good of laughter--less the two nuns,<br />\nprofessor's quips. Dr. Robinson who blushed.<br />\nput down his papers and notes<br />\nProfessor<br />\nThe<br />\naugust<br />\non the lectern, and then grinned beamed at us, and laughed at his<br />\nat us all. Then, he said in his own joke; he then calmly and<br />\nhigh, and slightly squeaky voice: quietly began his lecture.<br />\n\"Good morning. By the<br />\nIt is too bad that we do not<br />\nway, do you know why Mae have more Dr. David Moore<br />\nWest went to Addis Ababa?\" Robinsons.<br />\nThe class remained silent.<br />\nSome of us shook our heads.

They are genre<br />\nsuspense novels in which the characters take an active<br />\npart. But is it necessary to deliver these goods in such<br />\na violent, distrustful context?<br />\nThe solution would be to design games that<br />\ncombine mental challenge and role-playing within<br />\na cooperative atmosphere. There are some political and<br />\neconomic games, and more sports games (but why not<br />\nplay the sports themselves?) that do this, but there is<br />\nstill a long way to go when The Lord of the Rings, a<br />\nbook that shows the horrors of agressive militarism,<br />\nbecomes a game favoring agressive militarism (D &amp; D),<br />\nand the TV series Star Trek,a show denouncing military<br />\nsolutions, becomes a game resolved only through superior military force and strategy (Star Fleet Battles).<br />\nVIOLENCE EDUCATION<br />\nOne school of pacifist thought blames our<br />\nwarlike attitudes on the prevalence of militarism in our<br />\nenvironment. Nevertheless, once militarism has infiltrated our daily lives through the media, or, more<br />\nto our interest here, through the hobby of wargaming,<br />\nthe more we know about the realities of war,<br />\nthe<br /><br />\nFRIENDS?<br /><br />\nid Harris Gruman<br /><br />\nle story straightfrom the front.<br /><br />\nLrgamers tell all.<br />\nwhich can be described as the Frustrated Adolescent<br />\nIntellectual.

A Humanities<br />\nArea course, drawing its sources from an interdisciplinary range, could offer the students a fuller understanding<br />\nof the human and social dynamics as well as the potential dangers of war.

D &amp; D is<br />\nstructured so that it is impossible to play for a shorter<br />\nlength of time than a few hours, but the deep player<br />\nallows The Game to consume Friday night, Saturday,<br />\nand sometimes Sunday.<br />\nI have no criticism of wasting a few hours per<br />\nweek on gaming. There is nothing wrong with frittering<br />\naway a handful of hours on The Game, but there is an<br />\narbitrary boundary of reason which one or two entire<br />\ndays oversteps. And what is the final product? Nothing<br />\nsubstantial except for the end, is justified for a few<br />\nhours of leisure-time for the sake of pleasure alone, but<br />\none can spend too much time on it ...<br />\nThe paradox of The Game is that an enormous<br />\namount of time, creativity, writer's cramp,and thought<br />\nis injected into the creation by the referee (termed<br />\n\"Dungeonmaster\") of the fantasy world in which the<br />\nother players will adventure, but more time is put into<br />\nthe creation of the world than the actual play in it. To<br />\ncompound matters, the elaborate scenario created by the<br />\nDungeonmaster is wasted for the most part once it has<br />\nbeen played in. The Dungeonmaster is in charge of<br />\nconstructing and populating entire towns, vast stretches<br />\nof wilderness, and detailed underground labyrinths.<br />\nNaturally, he does not include every stone, tree, floorboard, and windowpane in his design, but an enormous<br />\namount of work goes into this process nonetheless.<br />\nAfter a certain point, one wonders why the Dungeonmaster doesn't just write his own fantasy novel and<br />\nforget The Game. A novel would be infinitely more<br />\nsatisfying (for he would be in control of the situation,<br />\nnot the players), and without a doubt it would be more<br />\nlasting. Once the players have entered the world created<br />\nby the Dungeonmaster, many parts of it become too<br />\nfamiliar or serve their purpose and cannot be reused.<br />\nThis means that the haggard Dungeonmaster must go<br />\nback and rework most portions of his world all over<br />\nagain... Once again, there is an ambiguous but extant<br />\nlimit of reason where the amount of imput does not<br />\njustify the final product.<br />\nGUT-SPILLING ACTION!!!<br />\nThe light player is intellectually aloof from The<br />\nGame; the deep player is so caught up in The Game that<br />\nhe must make some philosophical concessions in order<br />\nto survive. The most important lesson to learn in order<br />\nto escape (imaginary) death is that violence is a common, utilitarian, and often desirable solution to one's<br />\nproblems. Is there a foul-smelling, warty ogre standing<br />\nin your way? Hack it down! Show it no mercy! It was<br />\ncreated to be your opponent, and it must therefore fall<br />\nto your trusty blade! The majority of the rules of The<br />\nGame is a simulation of violence--an elaborate combat<br />\nsystem, magic both constructive and destructive, and a<br />\nplethora of monsters which are described, not as beings<br />\nwith cultures or personalities, but as a list of numbers<br />\nindicating how difficult they areto kill all make violence<br />\nthe centerpiece of The Game. There are very few<br />\nnon-violent rules in The Game, and to make matters<br />\nbloodier the only route for the advancement of the<br />\nplayer's characters is the killing of opponent after<br />\nopponent and the acquisition of large amounts of<br />\nwealth. In order to advance (or \"go up a level\" in<br />\nGamespeak), one cannot just subdue an opponent--you<br />\nmust kill it! There is no reward for cleverness or mercy,<br />\nbut for the bloodthirsty and the greedy there are benefits galore! One can attempt to play The Game without<br />\nsuch a materialistic/militaristic attitude, but it is nearly<br />\nimpossible to overcome these predetermined biases in<br />\nthe rules. Except for a few exceptions, the Game collapses into Social Darwinism in the trappings of heroic<br />\nfantasy. Nice guys really do finish last, and another<br />\nblow is struck for psychological egoism!<br />\nThe most stunning effect of the D &amp; D mentality<br />\nis the transmogrification of Walter Mitty types in the<br />\nactuality of their fantasies. The most quiet, amiable<br />\nperson is transformed into a feral-eyed barbarian,eagerly<br />\nhefting his battleaxe, snarling at the beserk goblin<br />\ncharging toward him,\"There ain't no way you're getting<br />\npast ME, sucker!\" Such courage! Such balls! Such<br />\nstrength of arms!<br />\nFine and dandy, but I believe human beings have<br />\nmatured ethically since the Dark Ages. Chivalry has been<br />\nshown for the sham it was,and now the Western world is<br />\n(hopefully) more enlightened.<br />\nSIR HEMINGWAY<br />\nThe typical D &amp; D personality is a species which<br />\nclosely resembles the American male ideal exemplified<br />\nby the Hemingway hero and what Tom Wolfe called the<br />\nfollowers of The Right Stuff. The idea is to be ballsy,<br />\nswaggering when you walk, endowed with a determination never to be pushed around by anyone,and possessing the ability to remain level-headed in dangerous<br />\nsituations. Cool courage! Machismo! Power! These are<br />\nthe real rules of the game, not explicitly stated in the<br />\nD &amp; D books but tacitly consented to by the players.<br />\nThere is no real ethical involvement, and one is not<br />\nreally putting lne's life on the line. Killed by an angry<br /><br />\nmob which is irate at your slaughter of innocent, defenseless villagers? Death means crumpling a piece of<br />\npaper and tossing it in the trash. No pain! No retribution for your actions, for your behavior is just as unreal<br />\nas your death! Wreak all the carnage you want, for no<br />\none can stop you! Prove yourself to be the better man,<br />\nno matter what the price!<br />\nAccording to paleoanthropology, one of the<br />\nmajor factors which contributed to the ascension of<br />\nthe human species as the dominant species on earth was<br />\ncooperation. Cooperation was an important factor in<br />\nprehistoric times, and it is an important ethic in day-today life today. Ironically, D &amp; D allegedly a life simulation (with fantastical elements here and there) almost<br />\nprides itself on a competition ethic.<br />\nThe end result is that D &amp; D creates an experiential tunnel vision for the deep player. It is impossible<br />\nto simulate a shy smile, the caress of a lover's hand, the<br />\nexuberance of science, the warm flush of friendliness,<br />\nthe fervor of painting, or any other experience which we<br />\nvalue highly. What D &amp; D can simulate is a love of<br />\nconflict, callousness towards violence, avariciousness,<br />\nand a desire for vengeance. A light player can enter this<br />\nrole-playing psychosis without being affected; for the<br />\ndeep player, it can become the dominant perspective on<br />\nlife and an entirely new set of ethical considerations.<br />\nA REAL-LIVE ELF!<br />\nThe relationship between a player and his character is strangely ambivalent. The character has no<br />\nobjective reality, so if it is killed, nothing is lost in a<br />\nmaterial sense. The character has a social reality as an<br />\nitem of prestige, though, so its loss can mean a drop in<br />\nthe status ladder of the D &amp; D group. D &amp; D is, after all,<br />\na process of interaction between individuals, so it is<br />\ninevitable that it is a social activity, with the characters<br />\nacting as reference points. If you somehow manage to<br />\ndevelop a relatively powerful character, then your<br />\nformidability in social reality as well as in D &amp; D<br />\n\"reality\" is increased. Characters are markers of achievement: the higher the character advances (and,to a lesser<br />\ndegree, the more interesting the personality of the<br />\ncharacter), the higher the status of the individual behind<br />\nthe character. Thus, although superficially it may seem<br />\nthat there is no attachment to a character, a great<br />\namount of psychological import is placed upon the<br />\ncharacter as a vector -within the social network of the<br />\nweekend D &amp; D group. Once again, the deeper the<br />\nplayer, the more catastrophic the consequences...<br />\nTHE CHARYBDIS OF CASH<br />\nOnce involved in D &amp; D, it is difficult to avoid<br />\ntoppling into the vortex of extra items. Aside from the<br />\nrulebooks, paper, dice, and pencils, there is a universe of<br />\nother items to buy. I have dice, but I could always use<br />\nmore... If I don't buy this set of supplementary rules, I<br />\nwill fall behind everyone else... Christ, I don't have any<br />\nelf miniatures, and here are some interesting minotaur<br />\nfigures, and here's an interesting dragon,and I could use<br />\nsome more dwarves... Not only does D &amp; D have the<br />\npotential for great psychological involvement for the<br />\ndeep player, but it coincides with an equal potential for<br />\nmonetary involvement. Rules! Miniatures! Dice! More<br />\nrules! Game aids! More miniatures!

Each of the<br />\ncharacters, either by choice or by the<br />\ntrickery of the other characters, ends up<br />\nspeaking with him in his office. Not only<br />\ndo the characters learn something about<br />\nthemselves and one another, but they<br />\ncome to see that love is merely a projection of one's wishes and desires onto<br />\nanother person. Only after this illusion is<br />\nshattered, by their being jilted, for<br />\nexample, can people truly see and understand each other.

Tom Schiller brings life to<br />\nthe stage, but his characterization occasionally slips into a stereotypical greatwhite-hunter routine. Hillary Freer is<br />\nconvincingly old as Julia; and Paul<br />\nGarlinghouse's odd mannerisms depict<br />\nPeter as an eccentric.

The show was<br />\nenjoyable and well worth seeing.<br /><br />\nRocking AtRitchie \"Coliseum\"<br /><br />\nElvis Costello Plays With Mannered Menace<br />\nBY DAVID NEWMAN<br />\nTrue to form, CBS Records left<br />\nElvis Costello in the lurch,forcing him to<br />\nprove his own worth. \"The hand that<br />\nfeeds him\" dealt Elvis two pretty low<br />\nblows going into Wednesday night's<br />\nCollege Park concert: first, they waited<br />\nuntil that morning to release Trust, his<br />\nnew album, and second, they chose the<br />\ndecrepit Ritchie \"Coliseum,\" which is<br />\nreally just an old gym, for the show,<br />\nrather than one of D.C.'s many good<br />\nconcert halls. So when Elvis took the<br />\nstage, it was up to him alone to deliver<br />\nthe unfamiliar material in less than<br />\nfavorable circumstances. And, true to<br />\nform, Elvis did the job--with verve, wit,<br />\nand even a few well-placed snarls.<br />\nLove, that untrustworthy old<br />\nstalwart, makes its tortured reappearance<br />\nin the new songs. Elvis played seven<br />\nsongs from Trust,and if the lyrics are any<br />\nindication, the anger of This Year's Model<br />\nis back with a dangerous new twist: Elvis<br />\nhas it under control. \"Black Sails in the<br />\nSunset\", \"Big Sister's Clothes\", and<br />\nparticularly \"Lovers Walk\" go back to the<br />\nold 1-got-b urned-and-now -watch -me-fume<br />\npose, but the delivery was different<br />\nhere--Elvis was at his most mannered,<br /><br />\nstrutting to and fro, peering coyly<br />\nthrough rose-colored glasses (!) and<br />\nnurturing each new hurt as if it were<br />\nanother gimmick in his bag of tricks:<br />\na New Wave Sinatra.<br />\nThe mannered delivery, in fact,<br />\nhighlighted the show. On the slower<br />\nnumbers, like \"Secondary Modern\",<br />\n\"Clowntime\", and an old R &amp; B weeper<br />\ncalled \"I Got Your Memory\", Elvis<br />\nlooked for all the world like some blueeyed soul crooner, clutching and sighing<br />\nin all the right places, heaving his<br />\nshoulders, and reeling off lyrics as if it<br />\nwere unpleasant to go through tortured<br />\nlove. What a change from the jerk who<br />\nwailed \"my aim is true.\"<br />\nThe price of this panache, sadly, is<br />\nthe emotion that marked the earlier<br />\nalbums and shows. \"Accidents Will<br />\nHappen\" and \"Temptation\" were messy<br />\nand unemotive, the antithesis of the early<br />\nCostello. The Attractions, themselves as<br />\ntight as ever, were joined by a big goon<br />\nnamed Monty Belmont on guitar; his<br />\nstage presence was forced, awkward, and<br />\ndidn't serve to rev up the band--if that's<br />\nall those grimaces and leaps and stupid<br />\nexpressions were supposed to do. Elvis<br />\nknew it, too--he was hiding behind his.<br />\nown veneer and the shouted \"Can you<br /><br />\nhear me?\" at the end of \"High Fidelity\"<br />\nmay have been a cry from the heart.<br />\nAll that pretense was dropped,<br />\nthough, in two solid encores. All the<br />\nstandards, like \"Pump It Up\" and<br />\n\"Oliver's Army,\" ran fast and smooth,<br />\nwith Elvis trading guitar fills against Steve<br />\nNaive's bouncing, complex keyboards.<br />\n\"Watching The Detectives\" even featured<br />\na quick change into--surprise--Stevie<br />\nWonder's \"Master Blaster\".<br />\nIf Elvis has put more space<br />\nbetween himself and all those rotten<br /><br />\nemotions about which he writes so well,<br />\nthe net gain is a man with more control<br />\nover his feeling\u2014someone you can trust.<br />\nOpening the night was Squeeze,<br />\nthe much-touted British band.

His performance,<br />\na mixture of the gruffness of old age, and<br />\nthe helpless confusion of infancy, is<br />\ncaptivating in its coarseness and total<br />\nlack of self-consciousness. The authenticity of Bruno's growing disgust with an<br /><br />\nKlaus Kinski as the power-crazed Aguirre<br />\noppressive, stagnant culture, which he<br />\nexpresses in eccentric grunts and<br />\ntwitches, adds to the documentary<br />\nflavor of the film.

Even though no other<br />\nteam at Hopkins gives written<br />\ntests, Coach Oles strongly asserts<br />\ntheir importance. \"Would you<br />\nsend your child off to play<br />\nfootball without knowing the<br />\nrules?\" says Oles.<br />\nOnce the two squads are<br />\nchosen (the J.V. is limited to<br />\nathletes who have never fenced<br />\nor taken a lesson before matriculating at Hopkins), each fencer<br />\nis assigned a weapon. The three<br />\nchoices are sabre, epee and foil.<br />\nPirate, used the sabre, which is<br />\nthe flashy, wide-cutting blade.<br />\nthe target area is the waist<br />\nup,\" says Oles, \"because back<br />\nthen it was considered unchivalrous to hit the horse.\"<br />\nThe epee is a rigid, longer<br />\nand less flexible thrusting weapon.

The foil begain as a<br />\nlightweight practice weapon for<br />\nwarmups before epee duels.<br />\n\"You'd expect a challenge, practice up with the lighter foil, and<br />\ngo get him,\" says Oles.
