He saw the usual group<br />\nof jean-clad mountain people and ragged darkies all staring at the half-dozen<br />\npicturesque revenue officers as they filed along. 'Gee!\" he said,\" if I had a<br />\npair of hoots to stick my breeches in, I would do, myself. Wide black hat\u2014<br />\ngun\u2014blue coat.\" Returned and briskly went at the steep hill.<br />\nHe had topped the rise, when he was passed by a lanky, chalk-faced<br />\nmountaineer, riding a scraggy mule, who had just left the station. The man<br />\nlooked the picture of indolence and apathy. He lolled back on the saddle, his<br />\nungainly legs swinging in time to the mule's amble, his bridle-hand resting on<br />\nthe big saddle horn. He rounded a curve a hundred yards ahead. The next<br />\nmoment the walker heard a sharp crack, and the irregular beat of galloping<br />\nhoofs. He sprang upon a stump. Through a gap in the trees he caught a<br />\nglimpse of the mule tearing by in a clumsy run, urged on by the vigorous<br />\nblows and kicks of its rider.<br />\nWondering a little, the young man continued on his ascending path. Soon<br />\nhe left behind the last outpost of the little settlement, and the world became a<br />\nvast slope of green, upward-rolling mountain spurs. The pines soughed in the<br />\nbalmy wind, and breathed down to him a pungent fragrance. He cast a last<br />\nlook behind him at the tiny village lying below. Then he turned, and plunged<br />\ninto the heart of the ever ascending forest.<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nGreen corn whiskey,fresh distilled, is no gentle drink; yet the gray-bearded<br />\nold moonshiner at one draught took nearly the whole glassful.<br />\n\"Hit air a main good bead,\" he chuckled, stirring up with a grimy talon a<br />\nmultitude of tiny bubbles in the finger's-breadth of liquor that remained. These<br />\nbetokened that there had been an unusually potent \"mash,\" or mixture of corn<br />\nand water left in a barrel to ferment before distillation.<br />\nThe old man picked up a bucket and went to the \"worm\" to get a fresh<br />\nsupply of whiskey. This clumsy, big retort, with its coil of copper pipe, nearly<br />\nfilled the little mud-chinked log cabin. Beside it, a stream of water trickled<br />\nalong a rude shute into a trough. The distiller picked up an earthenware jug<br />\nthat was lying by; and, having pulled out its corn-cob stopper, he skillfully proceeded, without the aid of a funnel, to decant into it the whiskey from his pail.<br />\nThe crouching old man, with his heavy brows and sharp eyes, was a naturally dignified and commanding figure. The effect, however, was hampered by<br />\nhis torn hickory shirt, crossed by a single suspender, and somewhat imperfectly<br />\nconnected with his butternut jeans; while his spreading brogans were slit open<br />\non each side, for the better accomodation of his \"footso's.\" This laxity of dress<br />\nindicated a corresponding freedom of thought and action. It hinted at the<br />\ndifficulties in store for any Professor of Governmental Theory, let us say, who<br />\nshould undertake to show him how it was less lawful to distill his corn than to<br />\ngrind it.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nBy this time the demijohn was filled. The kneeling man's hand was raised<br />\nto thump in the stopper, when a distant halloo floated into the cabin, and transformed him into a statue of expectancy. The water splashed and gurgled softly;<br />\na back log in the fire-place fell in with a hiss and crackle. Again came the call.<br />\nThe tnoonshiner sprang to the wall, snatched a long rifle, slipped on the strap<br />\nof the powder-horn and shot-pouch, and in a moment was crashing through the<br />\ndense, overhanging laurel-bushes of the little path. Coming around a turn, he<br />\nsuddenly ran into a long, chalk-faced mountaineer on a scraggy mule.<br />\nrd said:<br />\nThere was a short and energetic conversation.

Phrases such as<br />\ntween 500 and 1,000 late ticket holders were turned away from the doors shortly<br />\nafter eight o'clock,\" and \"the debate this year, as usual, helped bring togethe<br />\nr<br />\nthe people of the city and the college men\" have become so commonplace in re.<br />\nporting our debates that it is best to immediately proceed to a discussion<br />\nof the<br />\ndebate and contest themselves.<br />\nThe Freshman speakers were all good, but only the prize winner, Licking,<br />\nwas very good. He was the only speaker who had force, and being blessed<br />\nwith a finely modulated voice, he was able to hold the attention of his audience.<br />\nHumrichhouse had the tendency to let his eyes wander into celestia<br />\nl regions<br />\nwhile he was talking in tragic depths of Schley's attack on Santiago. Schapiro had disadvantages to overcome, which, when taken into conside<br />\nration,<br />\ncause us to call his effort a strong one. But with Schapiro as with Humric<br />\nhhouse the performance idea was too powerful; any one could tell that<br />\nthe men<br />\nwere reciting, and not giving their own speeches. All three speakers<br />\nmade<br />\nmuch better use of gesture than is usual among speakers from the first<br />\nyear<br />\nclass.<br />\nIn the debate, the seniors were fairly out-classed. Excuses are the<br />\neasiest<br />\nthings in the world to find, but one reason for the defeat of<br />\nthe seniors is so<br />\npowerfully apparent that it would be foolish to delve into the<br />\nfires and cons of<br />\nthe matter. The junior team was manifestly superior to that<br />\nof the seniors. It<br />\nis true that the juniors had the negative of the question [Resolv<br />\ned that: \"Trusts<br />\nthreaten the future welfare of the United States,1 and that<br />\nthey had the advantage of having the last speech, but their speakers were so<br />\nsuperior in effective delivery to the seniors that even with an equality of argume<br />\nnt the debate<br />\nwould probably have gone to them, Even as it was they<br />\nslightly surpassed<br />\ntheir opponents in weight of argument.<br />\nFred. L. (;uggenheirner, who was the first speaker for<br />\nthe affirmative, tried<br />\nto make a dramatic recital out of an essay. Especially<br />\nwas his dramatic affectation noticed in the wild use he made of his hands.<br />\nOtherwise he was excellent. His voice could be heard all over the hall,<br />\nhis enunciation was distinct, and he brought out the connection between his argume<br />\nnts as well as his<br />\nspeech allowed.<br />\nHarry Plaggemeyer led for the negative and, with<br />\nhis colleague Blum, won<br />\nthe honors of the evening. Intense, and thoroughly<br />\ninterested in his subject,<br />\nhe doubtless made a great many .people think he was<br />\nmaking points, whereas<br />\nhis speech had hardly anything to do with the subjcct<br />\nunder discussion. There<br />\nis something impressive in Plaggemeyer's peculiar<br />\nmanner of \"talking\" to an<br />\naudience, which is far more effective than much that is<br />\nmiscalled oratory.<br />\nChas. A. Markell, Jr., was the second man on the<br />\naffirmative. The continuity of his arguments was broken several times<br />\nby repetitions caused by for-<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\ngetfulness, and his hearers found difficulty in following him. It is possible that<br />\nsome of his arguments were sound, but he did not succeed in impressing them<br />\nUpon his audience.<br />\nSolomon Blum followed Markell. He gave evidence of an ability to do<br />\nbetter work than he did. Blum seemed to think that the distinguished judges<br />\nof the debate are in the habit of frequenting the galleries of theatres. Much of<br />\nhis\u2022speech was a histrionic effort for the \"gods.\" It is very good to be sarcastic, but the value of sarcasm is in inverse ratio to its abundance; it is very<br />\ngood to ask oratorical questions, but, as the Germans say, \"zu viel is/ ungesztnd.\" Blum should not have strived openly for effect so much, for at his<br />\nbest he certainly is a good speaker, has a flexible, open, full voice. His arguments were better than his colleague's, and, altogether, he was equal to the high<br />\nstandard set by his co-workers in the evening's debate.<br />\nHarvey B. Stone summed up for the affirmative, and did it well. He is a<br />\nconvincing speaker, natural, and at home. Like Blum, however, he was at<br />\ntimes too clever; and allowed his propensity to \"get on\" with the audience to<br />\nrun ahead of his reason. Most of his speech was extemporaneous, and he<br />\nshowed ability to think quickly and speak epigrammatically.<br />\nWhen G. D. Strayer arose to end the debate many points brought up by<br />\nthe affirmative still remained unanswered. He answered most of them, and the<br />\ndebate went to the juniors. Undoubtedly much that he said could have been<br />\nrefuted by a following speaker, but this advantage always lies with the neg\u2022<br />\native. Strayer made no attempt at oratory, and the effect that he produced was<br />\nalmost entirely due to his arguments. He spoke plainly and clearly, and<br />\nshowed a comprehensive grasp of the whole argument of the seniors. When he<br />\nfinished speaking there was no doubt as to whom the debating trophy of 1902<br />\nwould be awarded.<br />\nAll the men showed the effects of good training by Dr. Lee and his assistants, Mr. French and Mr. Thomas, and the undergraduates can be satisfied<br />\nwith the success of the affair.<br />\nThe senior alternates were: Ross M. Diggs, S. Wolman, Wm. Kirk. Advisers: J. G. Campbell, W. H. Koppelman, Chas. A. Myers. Junior alternates were: A. R. V. Dochez, J. B. G. Cutis, Jr. J. M. Coombs. Advisers:<br />\nH, K. Tootle, T. W.

U.; or box 398, Medical School of Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nN the article on the fifth public interclass debate the writer, who is a member<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nof one of the earlier teams, well says that the success of these debates<br />\nreached their summit two or three years ago, and that this year's contest<br />\nwas in every respect up to this height. Only those who have ever tried for a<br />\nposition on the debating teams realize what the cost of this success is, how<br />\nstrenuous are the efforts of the men trying for positions, how difficult the work of<br />\nDr. Lee and his assistants. The men on the teams deserve congratulations for<br />\nthe spirit they have shown, for without willingness on the part of the students<br />\nthe affair could not be a success; but to Dr. Lee, as originator of the plan of<br />\ninter class debates, belongs the chief credit. The advantages of these annual<br />\naffairs as a means of communication between the city and the college have been<br />\nharped upon till the string is almost broken. This year the especial interest in<br />\nthe debate lay in the fact that it served as a trying-out for positions on the college team to represent Hopkins in her first intercollegiate debate, to be held<br />\nagainst the undergraduates of the University of North Carolina, Thursday of<br />\nthis week.<br />\nThis debate is really the culmination of the five years work in the college<br />\nHouse and Senate, and is possibly regarded as one of the most important dates<br />\nin the undergraduate calendar for 1902. The men who tried for positions exerted every effort, and the two men finally selected represent the best in the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHopkins undergraduate body. North Carolina has always held a high record<br />\nin the matter of good speakers, and it is reasonable to suppose that the men<br />\nshe sends against Hopkins will be her best. Consequently the debate should<br />\nbe a close fight, in which the better team will win. The Hopkins team is going<br />\nin with well-founded confidence, but, win or lose, the spirit which prompted our<br />\nmen to work will still be there, and if we lose, we will acknowledge defeat at<br />\nthe hands of superiors with the same spirit with which we would celebrate<br />\nvictory.<br />\nT Hopkins, as every one knows, the number of undergraduate students<br />\nreaches the sublime heights of one hundred and sixty six (166). Of these<br />\nmen, about thirty are engaged in lacrosse, twenty or more in base ball,<br />\nfifteen or twenty in track and field work, and the same number tried for the<br />\n'varsity football team last fall. On the musical clubs are about twenty-five un<br />\ndergraduates, twenty two men are interested in Hullabaloo and NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwork, and each year there are some twenty five candidates for positions on the<br />\ndebating teams. Altogether this means that on the average every man at Hopkins is interested in some branch outside his study, even though a scholastic<br />\naverage of two and a half is required before participation in these enterprises is<br />\nallowed. With these figures staring one in the face no one can say that Hopkins spirit is low. There is plenty of spirit here, and plenty of life. A man<br />\nundergoes the same experiences of life whether he walks on a sixteen acre<br />\ncampus or crosses the cobbles of a narrow street. With such a condition of<br />\naffairs why do we not have some Hopkins stories? The background is excellent; incidents which will work up into good short stories are continually arising. A retrospect into the history of some of our recently graduated class will<br />\nreveal plot and counterplot, which in stirring dramatic force excells the wildest<br />\nmelodramas. There can be no doubt that the material is on hand for Hopkins<br />\nshort stories. So far what has not been in evidence is Hopkins men to write<br />\nthe stories. The NEWS LETTER'S present policy of publishing short stories<br />\ncould take no better form than in stories of the deeds of Hopkins' own sons.<br />\nWe hope that men who call write will take this matter in hand, and possibly<br />\nwe may soon be able to give to the reading public a collection of short stories.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nHE Musical Clubs desire to extend their thanks, through the columns of<br />\nthe NEWS LETTER, to all those members of the Faculty and student body<br />\nwho by their large attendance made the Baltimore Concert such a success.<br />\nThe encouragement of a crowded house doubly recompensed the members, leaders and managers for their work and trouble; for the shekels gathered in were<br />\nso many that not only have all the Club debts been paid off, but a substantial<br />\nsurplus remains towards defraying the expenses of the Easter trip to Old Point.<br />\nIf this in turn is successful, it will again be the pleasure of the Clubs to aid<br />\nsome department of athletics as they did last year, when, in addition to the<br />\nathletic concert, $100.00 was given to the training table fund.<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nITH its last issue, the special celebration number, the NEws-Livrrim<br />\nreached the highest point of its circulation. A great many extra copies<br />\nwere sold to those who wished to preserve a compact account of the exercises. These have gone in all directions, one as far as the Philippines Islands.<br />\nThis climax of circulation and expansion, however, comes at a time when the<br />\nstaff is about to be weakened by the loss of some of its members. The paper<br />\nwill, as usual, be handed over to the Junior class at Easter, and the resignation<br />\nat that time of four Senior members of the board will leave as many positions<br />\nvacant.<br />\nIn the competition which has just closed, some very creditable work was<br />\ndone, and several of those who were passed over can continue their efforts with a<br />\ngood chance of success. But it must not be thought that the opportunity of<br />\nsecuring a place is in any way narrowed down. We would like to hear from<br />\nany and every student who has an idea for a humorous sketch, a poem, a story,<br />\nor who can furnish news notes of alumni, etc., or wishes to take a trial assignment to cover some college event.<br />\n<br />\n(W<br />\n<br />\nTHE CONCERT OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nRIDAY evening, February 14, the annual concert of the t iopkins Musical<br />\nClubs was held at Lehmann'g Hall. The hall was splendidly filled, even<br />\nthe gallery being crowded. Over a hundred girls from the Woman's Col<br />\nlege, delegations from various schools, along with many of this season's debutantes and next year's, were in the audience. The walls were well decorated,<br />\nbut not quite as attractively as the auditorium itself.<br />\nEverything went off as smoothly as could be desired. The program opened<br />\nwith the Glee Club singing The 'Varsity Ode, the soberness of which was relieved by the encore which they sang. Then came ''The Mosquito Parade,\"<br />\nby the Banjo Club, followed by the \"Invincible Eagle,\" played by the Mandolin Club. Mr. Gilman, of the Medical School, then sang three very effective<br />\nnumbers. He has a splendid, round, full voice, well under control. It lacks<br />\nonly dramatic fire. His song of the \"Blacksmith\" was by far the best he<br />\nrendered. Mr. Edgeworth Smith's \"The Ragged Raglan,\" played in a dashing<br />\nmanner by the Banjo Club, won great applause, as did J. H. Iiager's \"1902<br />\nMedley.\" Then Mr. Edgeworth Smith (lid a difficult turn with the banjo.<br />\nMr. Atkinson's coon songs seemed to please everybody. The program ended<br />\nwith W. B. Carver's 'Alma rater in Dixie Land,\" which is not as affective by<br />\nthe clubs as on the field.<br />\nFrom a musical standpoint, the Banjo Club deserves the most praise. They<br />\nhave been well trained, and seemed to understand and to have confidence in<br />\ntheir leader. They played with great spirit and dash. The volume and roundness of their tone was always good. The Mandolin Club played fairly well,<br />\nbut at times they were lacking in volume and unity of tone. The Glee Club is<br />\nin had need of more tenors. There was a heavy strain on that \"part of the club<br />\nwhich caused too great an effort, the high notes being left almost entirely to<br />\nMr. Carver.<br />\nAll in all it was a most satisfactory concert. The management and the<br />\nplayers are to be congratulated upon the smoothness with which everything<br />\nwas handled.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n\f9<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n111111111111111111111111111111<br />\n<br />\n11111111 11111111 11111 fill<br />\n<br />\nrfsgiollonointplin '1144<br />\n=mon<br />\n<br />\nsem<br />\n<br />\nlili,q1A11111<br />\nNaar Oki<br />\nelo ass ___<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n111114111111111r10111111111110110illAN:111111110111MIIIIIIICIrill11111111111IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII3101101111111011111fill1/11111Ininilli!li1111110!1:1:::1::'\u201e ,<br />\n<br />\nR.

In the article which is entitled<br />\n\"The Launching of a University,\" Dr. Gilman gives some entertaining<br />\nreminiscences of the early days of the University, and of the men who were<br />\nidentified with him in those days. Especially interesting is his account of how<br />\nit happened that the late Professor Rowland, at that time but twenty-eight years<br />\nold, and an assistant instructor in the Reusselear Polytechnic Institute, was<br />\nselected for the chair of physics.<br />\nPresident Remsen was in Chicago during the week of February 24, attending a meeting of \"The Association of American Universities.\" The object of the<br />\nassociation, as Dr. Remsen explained, is merely to discuss important questions<br />\nof education. The discussion at the Chicago meeting was on the requirement<br />\nof a dissertation for the degree of doctor of philosophy, and the additional requisite that his treatise be published. This is a topic of special interest to Hopkins men, since the University has always required that the candidate for a<br />\ndoctor's degree have his thesis printed.<br />\nWhile in Chicago Dr. Remsen was the guest at a number of social events<br />\nDr. Henry Wood was in Cambridge last week attending a reception given<br />\nto Prince Henry.<br />\n<br />\n\f10<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor A.

They now play as if they were beginning to<br />\nsee through the game, and are doing more of the quick passing which, heretofore, has helped Hopkins to outplay weight.<br />\nAmong those who have played before this year, but not on the team, Sidney Smith, Bird, Bryan, and Custis are forging to the front. Smith has been<br />\nplaying a good, heady game on the attack; but during the last week he has been<br />\na little off color. Bird and Bryan are both making a good showing, but still<br />\nhave something to learn. The former's fault seems to be the lack of clean stickwork; his idea of team work is good, but owing to a hitch in his passing he cannot always carry it out. This trouble ought to be adjusted by practice. As for<br />\nBryan, he shows good ability to catch and pass the ball when it is put to him;<br />\nbut he does not fight hard enough to get it himself. Custis is daily improving<br />\nin his stickwork, but has not reached the perfection mark yet. He is being<br />\ntried out on the defense. It is hoped that he will make a better showing when<br />\nout-door practice begins.<br />\nOf the new men at the game, S. Pearre, Matthai, and Blanck are the only<br />\nones in the race, Pearre has been alternating between in and out-home and<br />\nought to make a good one next year. He is playing a clever game. Much the<br />\nsame may be said about Matthai; he has been playing at centre and third attack. Blanck, our foot ball captain, is making a creditable showing at close<br />\ndefense. He is playing a hard and heady game; and if he can bring his stickwork up to the required standard, he will probably help Hopkins in her games<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe old men all seem to be improving, but they never do play their game<br />\nuntil they get out of doors. The Cage seems to lower their lacrosse ability.<br />\nThe great thing which worries the coaches now is to find the combination<br />\nwhich will make the best team They have plenty of material for the attack<br />\nand the defense, but as always they are a little shy on good goal-keepers.<br />\nBriscoe, who played in many of the games last year, has been out as often as<br />\nhis work at the Medical School will permit. Pets and P. Straus are both nervy<br />\nplayers, but lack experience. Captain Schmeisser, who played goal until late<br />\nin his freshman year, has again been trying to get his eye in so that he may be<br />\nable, in case of necessity, to fill the position.<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough it is still very early and always dangerous to make predictions,<br />\nespecially when the men have had no outdoor practice, yet the NEWS LETER<br />\nwould like to predict that the team will be selected from the following men:<br />\nAbercrombie, W. Sehmeisser, Straus, B. Bernheitn, P. Bernheim, Briscoe,<br />\nPutts, E. Schtneisser, Tough, Sayler, Bird, Smith, Bryan, Custis, Blanck,<br />\nPearre, Pels, P. Straus, Matthai.<br />\nAs soon as the snow gets off the ground, the team will begin to practice at<br />\nthe American League Park. Here the real practice commences, the practice<br />\nthat will mean the winning or losing of the championship. It is hoped that the<br />\nattendance will be large enough to give the \"'Varsity\" a good scrub to play<br />\nagainst each day.<br />\n<br />\nBASE BALL.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE response to the call for candidates made on February 15 has been so<br />\nhearty and so well sustained that the success of the team promises to be a<br />\nquestion of degree. On Tuesdays Thursdays, and Saturdays the squad<br />\nhas practice, and on no afternoon have less than fifteen men been out, the number being frequently twenty or more. It seems absurd that Hopkins cannot<br />\nnow equal her former reputation in base ball. This inability appears about to<br />\nbe ended. The season will soon begin, and sp far there has been no flagging<br />\nin interest. The outcome of the whole movement now lies almost altogether<br />\nwith the men themselves. Heretofore, lack of grounds has proved a stumbling<br />\nblock; but this year outdoor grounds and all other essential conditions have<br />\nbeen provided for. The opportunity is certainly excellent.<br />\nThe team is fortunate in having as manager Mr. Maurice Lazenby, of the<br />\nMedical School, who was elected at the first meeting of the candidates. Mr.<br />\nLazenby has been active for several years in promoting the success of athletics<br />\nat Hopkins, and his service in this new cause goes to swell a long list of former<br />\nservices. He has named, as his assistants, L. M. R. Willis and J N. Numsen, '04.<br />\nAs for the men themselves, nothing need be feared, except possible listlessness. There is no sign of this at present. Work in the Cage consists of<br />\nhandling batted balls, of getting arms into condition, and of batting. This last<br />\nexercise should have telling effect. No college in the country has such a place<br />\nto train batters. The infield positions are aspired to by as many as ten men,<br />\nand there are tried men for the outfield The pitchers are in good condition,<br />\nand give promise of making conquests. Both of them have good curves, with<br />\nspeed and control.<br />\nThe schedule, as partially arranged, includes games at home with Princeton and Georgetown, and abroad with Rock Hill, the Naval Cadets (probably),<br />\nMaryland Agricultural College, and Western Maryland College.<br />\nIn view of this auspicious beginning, every lover of college sport at Hopkins<br />\nought to be loyal and stand behind the new effort, so that it does not fail. Let<br />\nthe players be encouraged, the games patronized, and above all let there be a<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\ngeneral participation in the game itself. The best team will come from many<br />\ncandidates. When out-door work begins, it will he necessary to have two<br />\nteams. This is imperative. There is work for all. The undergraduates, particularly, should remember that upon them depends largely the fate of the sport<br />\nin the years'to follow.

Every<br />\n1903 man has exhibited the usual class spirit by signing a slip stating that he<br />\nwill contribute financially and otherwise to the success of the new organization,<br />\nand failure is out of the question. The club is to be strictly a senior institution<br />\nas the name signifies, and will be kept up each year by the graduating class at<br />\nthe University. Those who take degrees will be numbered thereafter among<br />\nits honorary members.<br />\nIt is not improbable that the idea was suggested by President Remsen's<br />\nshort address at the annual athletic feed. In speaking of student organizations<br />\nfor the promotion of social intercourse he referred in the highest terms to the<br />\nHouston Club of the University of Pennsylvania and expressed a wish that<br />\nHopkins might, sometime, have a similar organization.<br />\nTo those who have visited the magnificent quarters of the students at<br />\nPennsylvania, our chances for such a club in the near future seem very slight.<br />\nEverything has a beginning, however, and some day may find the Senior Club<br />\nhandsomely located among the many imposing buildings at Homewood.<br />\nIn recognition of their work, the junior class elected the ten men, who have<br />\ncrystallized the plans as members of the first board of governors.

Mr. W. B. Hill, manager of last season's foot ball team, will have<br />\ncharge of the Hopkins correspondence.<br />\nThe magazine will contain timely articles on all important questions of<br />\nathletics, and will prove of great value in making every one acquainted with<br />\nthe conditions existing at the different colleges. This will be particularly valuable to Hopkins, since it furnishes an organ wherein we can explain the peculiar situation in which we are placed athletically.<br />\n<br />\n(W<br />\n<br />\n\"That man who just passed had such a strong resemblance to some one I<br />\nknow very well\u2014 but I can't think who.\"<br />\n\"He did look like the devil.\"\u2014Princeton Tiger.<br />\n<br />\nHOTSTUFF: \"I nearly broke the bank with a flush last night.\"<br />\nLUKE WARM: \"Why didn't you?\"<br />\nHOTSTUFF: \"1 had'nt the heart to do it.\"\u2014Harvard Lampoon.<br />\n\"She said I might kiss her on either cheek'\"<br />\n'What did you do?\"<br />\n\"I hesitated a long time between.\"\u2014Ex.<br />\nHe meant to tell her merely<br />\nThat he felt \"jaded and fagged,\"<br />\nBut he got mixed up queerly,<br />\nAnd said he was \"faded and jagged.\"<br />\n\u2014Yale Record.<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Baltimore Infirmary of Osteopathy<br />\n804 UNION TRUST BUILDING,<br />\n<br />\nN.

But hyeh comes the train;<br />\ngood-bye, seh, you cehtainly do look well an' proud from when you came hyeh.\"<br />\nAs the engine clanked away, the ruddy-faced young man paused on his<br />\nway up the next hill, and looked hack at the station. He saw the usual group<br />\nof jean-clad mountain people and ragged darkies all staring at the half-dozen<br />\npicturesque revenue officers as they filed along. 'Gee!\" he said,\" if I had a<br />\npair of hoots to stick my breeches in, I would do, myself. Wide black hat\u2014<br />\ngun\u2014blue coat.\" Returned and briskly went at the steep hill.<br />\nHe had topped the rise, when he was passed by a lanky, chalk-faced<br />\nmountaineer, riding a scraggy mule, who had just left the station. The man<br />\nlooked the picture of indolence and apathy. He lolled back on the saddle, his<br />\nungainly legs swinging in time to the mule's amble, his bridle-hand resting on<br />\nthe big saddle horn. He rounded a curve a hundred yards ahead. The next<br />\nmoment the walker heard a sharp crack, and the irregular beat of galloping<br />\nhoofs. He sprang upon a stump. Through a gap in the trees he caught a<br />\nglimpse of the mule tearing by in a clumsy run, urged on by the vigorous<br />\nblows and kicks of its rider.<br />\nWondering a little, the young man continued on his ascending path. Soon<br />\nhe left behind the last outpost of the little settlement, and the world became a<br />\nvast slope of green, upward-rolling mountain spurs. The pines soughed in the<br />\nbalmy wind, and breathed down to him a pungent fragrance. He cast a last<br />\nlook behind him at the tiny village lying below. Then he turned, and plunged<br />\ninto the heart of the ever ascending forest.<br />\nII<br /><br />\nGreen corn whiskey,fresh distilled, is no gentle drink; yet the gray-bearded<br />\nold moonshiner at one draught took nearly the whole glassful.<br />\n\"Hit air a main good bead,\" he chuckled, stirring up with a grimy talon a<br />\nmultitude of tiny bubbles in the finger's-breadth of liquor that remained. These<br />\nbetokened that there had been an unusually potent \"mash,\" or mixture of corn<br />\nand water left in a barrel to ferment before distillation.<br />\nThe old man picked up a bucket and went to the \"worm\" to get a fresh<br />\nsupply of whiskey. This clumsy, big retort, with its coil of copper pipe, nearly<br />\nfilled the little mud-chinked log cabin. Beside it, a stream of water trickled<br />\nalong a rude shute into a trough. The distiller picked up an earthenware jug<br />\nthat was lying by; and, having pulled out its corn-cob stopper, he skillfully proceeded, without the aid of a funnel, to decant into it the whiskey from his pail.<br />\nThe crouching old man, with his heavy brows and sharp eyes, was a naturally dignified and commanding figure. The effect, however, was hampered by<br />\nhis torn hickory shirt, crossed by a single suspender, and somewhat imperfectly<br />\nconnected with his butternut jeans; while his spreading brogans were slit open<br />\non each side, for the better accomodation of his \"footso's.\" This laxity of dress<br />\nindicated a corresponding freedom of thought and action. It hinted at the<br />\ndifficulties in store for any Professor of Governmental Theory, let us say, who<br />\nshould undertake to show him how it was less lawful to distill his corn than to<br />\ngrind it.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nBy this time the demijohn was filled. The kneeling man's hand was raised<br />\nto thump in the stopper, when a distant halloo floated into the cabin, and transformed him into a statue of expectancy. The water splashed and gurgled softly;<br />\na back log in the fire-place fell in with a hiss and crackle. Again came the call.<br />\nThe tnoonshiner sprang to the wall, snatched a long rifle, slipped on the strap<br />\nof the powder-horn and shot-pouch, and in a moment was crashing through the<br />\ndense, overhanging laurel-bushes of the little path. Coming around a turn, he<br />\nsuddenly ran into a long, chalk-faced mountaineer on a scraggy mule.<br />\nrd said:<br />\nThere was a short and energetic conversation. Then the graybea<br />\nwhen<br />\nbrotheh<br />\nyouah<br />\nnamed<br />\nthey<br />\nThey-tins named me, did they? I reckon<br />\nhis<br />\nof<br />\nscrap<br />\na<br />\noff<br />\nripped<br />\nhe<br />\nspoke,<br />\nthey shot him down col'-blooded.\" As he<br />\ngun<br />\nloading<br />\nmuzzlehis<br />\ndown<br />\nit<br />\ng<br />\nshirt, and neatly \"patched\" a bullet, rammin<br />\nwith a quick but shaking hand. \"You git th' boys from the yan' fiel an' wait<br />\nfoh me. I'm a-goin' to lay hid at Sandy Gap. I am' a-lookin' foh but one of<br />\n'em, 'n' ef I get him, I'm comin' back in right smaht of a hurry.\"<br />\na mile; then<br />\nThey parted. The old man continued down the path for half<br />\nlaurel.<br />\nthick<br />\nhe turned sharply to the right and pushed his way through the<br />\nthe<br />\nand<br />\n,<br />\nsharply<br />\nSuddenly he stopped. Below him the mountain side fell away<br />\nging<br />\noverhan<br />\ntrail, recurving, was again visible.

Phrases such as<br />\ntween 500 and 1,000 late ticket holders were turned away from the doors shortly<br />\nafter eight o'clock,\" and \"the debate this year, as usual, helped bring togethe<br />\nr<br />\nthe people of the city and the college men\" have become so commonplace in re.<br />\nporting our debates that it is best to immediately proceed to a discussion<br />\nof the<br />\ndebate and contest themselves.<br />\nThe Freshman speakers were all good, but only the prize winner, Licking,<br />\nwas very good. He was the only speaker who had force, and being blessed<br />\nwith a finely modulated voice, he was able to hold the attention of his audience.<br />\nHumrichhouse had the tendency to let his eyes wander into celestia<br />\nl regions<br />\nwhile he was talking in tragic depths of Schley's attack on Santiago. Schapiro had disadvantages to overcome, which, when taken into conside<br />\nration,<br />\ncause us to call his effort a strong one. But with Schapiro as with Humric<br />\nhhouse the performance idea was too powerful; any one could tell that<br />\nthe men<br />\nwere reciting, and not giving their own speeches. All three speakers<br />\nmade<br />\nmuch better use of gesture than is usual among speakers from the first<br />\nyear<br />\nclass.<br />\nIn the debate, the seniors were fairly out-classed. Excuses are the<br />\neasiest<br />\nthings in the world to find, but one reason for the defeat of<br />\nthe seniors is so<br />\npowerfully apparent that it would be foolish to delve into the<br />\nfires and cons of<br />\nthe matter. The junior team was manifestly superior to that<br />\nof the seniors. It<br />\nis true that the juniors had the negative of the question [Resolv<br />\ned that: \"Trusts<br />\nthreaten the future welfare of the United States,1 and that<br />\nthey had the advantage of having the last speech, but their speakers were so<br />\nsuperior in effective delivery to the seniors that even with an equality of argume<br />\nnt the debate<br />\nwould probably have gone to them, Even as it was they<br />\nslightly surpassed<br />\ntheir opponents in weight of argument.<br />\nFred. L. (;uggenheirner, who was the first speaker for<br />\nthe affirmative, tried<br />\nto make a dramatic recital out of an essay. Especially<br />\nwas his dramatic affectation noticed in the wild use he made of his hands.<br />\nOtherwise he was excellent. His voice could be heard all over the hall,<br />\nhis enunciation was distinct, and he brought out the connection between his argume<br />\nnts as well as his<br />\nspeech allowed.<br />\nHarry Plaggemeyer led for the negative and, with<br />\nhis colleague Blum, won<br />\nthe honors of the evening. Intense, and thoroughly<br />\ninterested in his subject,<br />\nhe doubtless made a great many .people think he was<br />\nmaking points, whereas<br />\nhis speech had hardly anything to do with the subjcct<br />\nunder discussion. There<br />\nis something impressive in Plaggemeyer's peculiar<br />\nmanner of \"talking\" to an<br />\naudience, which is far more effective than much that is<br />\nmiscalled oratory.<br />\nChas. A. Markell, Jr., was the second man on the<br />\naffirmative. The continuity of his arguments was broken several times<br />\nby repetitions caused by for-<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\ngetfulness, and his hearers found difficulty in following him. It is possible that<br />\nsome of his arguments were sound, but he did not succeed in impressing them<br />\nUpon his audience.<br />\nSolomon Blum followed Markell. He gave evidence of an ability to do<br />\nbetter work than he did. Blum seemed to think that the distinguished judges<br />\nof the debate are in the habit of frequenting the galleries of theatres. Much of<br />\nhis\u2022speech was a histrionic effort for the \"gods.\" It is very good to be sarcastic, but the value of sarcasm is in inverse ratio to its abundance; it is very<br />\ngood to ask oratorical questions, but, as the Germans say, \"zu viel is/ ungesztnd.\" Blum should not have strived openly for effect so much, for at his<br />\nbest he certainly is a good speaker, has a flexible, open, full voice. His arguments were better than his colleague's, and, altogether, he was equal to the high<br />\nstandard set by his co-workers in the evening's debate.<br />\nHarvey B. Stone summed up for the affirmative, and did it well. He is a<br />\nconvincing speaker, natural, and at home. Like Blum, however, he was at<br />\ntimes too clever; and allowed his propensity to \"get on\" with the audience to<br />\nrun ahead of his reason. Most of his speech was extemporaneous, and he<br />\nshowed ability to think quickly and speak epigrammatically.<br />\nWhen G. D. Strayer arose to end the debate many points brought up by<br />\nthe affirmative still remained unanswered. He answered most of them, and the<br />\ndebate went to the juniors. Undoubtedly much that he said could have been<br />\nrefuted by a following speaker, but this advantage always lies with the neg\u2022<br />\native. Strayer made no attempt at oratory, and the effect that he produced was<br />\nalmost entirely due to his arguments. He spoke plainly and clearly, and<br />\nshowed a comprehensive grasp of the whole argument of the seniors. When he<br />\nfinished speaking there was no doubt as to whom the debating trophy of 1902<br />\nwould be awarded.<br />\nAll the men showed the effects of good training by Dr. Lee and his assistants, Mr. French and Mr. Thomas, and the undergraduates can be satisfied<br />\nwith the success of the affair.<br />\nThe senior alternates were: Ross M.

Only those who have ever tried for a<br />\nposition on the debating teams realize what the cost of this success is, how<br />\nstrenuous are the efforts of the men trying for positions, how difficult the work of<br />\nDr. Lee and his assistants. The men on the teams deserve congratulations for<br />\nthe spirit they have shown, for without willingness on the part of the students<br />\nthe affair could not be a success; but to Dr. Lee, as originator of the plan of<br />\ninter class debates, belongs the chief credit. The advantages of these annual<br />\naffairs as a means of communication between the city and the college have been<br />\nharped upon till the string is almost broken. This year the especial interest in<br />\nthe debate lay in the fact that it served as a trying-out for positions on the college team to represent Hopkins in her first intercollegiate debate, to be held<br />\nagainst the undergraduates of the University of North Carolina, Thursday of<br />\nthis week.<br />\nThis debate is really the culmination of the five years work in the college<br />\nHouse and Senate, and is possibly regarded as one of the most important dates<br />\nin the undergraduate calendar for 1902. The men who tried for positions exerted every effort, and the two men finally selected represent the best in the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nHopkins undergraduate body. North Carolina has always held a high record<br />\nin the matter of good speakers, and it is reasonable to suppose that the men<br />\nshe sends against Hopkins will be her best. Consequently the debate should<br />\nbe a close fight, in which the better team will win. The Hopkins team is going<br />\nin with well-founded confidence, but, win or lose, the spirit which prompted our<br />\nmen to work will still be there, and if we lose, we will acknowledge defeat at<br />\nthe hands of superiors with the same spirit with which we would celebrate<br />\nvictory.<br />\nT Hopkins, as every one knows, the number of undergraduate students<br />\nreaches the sublime heights of one hundred and sixty six (166). Of these<br />\nmen, about thirty are engaged in lacrosse, twenty or more in base ball,<br />\nfifteen or twenty in track and field work, and the same number tried for the<br />\n'varsity football team last fall. On the musical clubs are about twenty-five un<br />\ndergraduates, twenty two men are interested in Hullabaloo and NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwork, and each year there are some twenty five candidates for positions on the<br />\ndebating teams. Altogether this means that on the average every man at Hopkins is interested in some branch outside his study, even though a scholastic<br />\naverage of two and a half is required before participation in these enterprises is<br />\nallowed. With these figures staring one in the face no one can say that Hopkins spirit is low. There is plenty of spirit here, and plenty of life. A man<br />\nundergoes the same experiences of life whether he walks on a sixteen acre<br />\ncampus or crosses the cobbles of a narrow street. With such a condition of<br />\naffairs why do we not have some Hopkins stories? The background is excellent; incidents which will work up into good short stories are continually arising. A retrospect into the history of some of our recently graduated class will<br />\nreveal plot and counterplot, which in stirring dramatic force excells the wildest<br />\nmelodramas. There can be no doubt that the material is on hand for Hopkins<br />\nshort stories. So far what has not been in evidence is Hopkins men to write<br />\nthe stories. The NEWS LETTER'S present policy of publishing short stories<br />\ncould take no better form than in stories of the deeds of Hopkins' own sons.<br />\nWe hope that men who call write will take this matter in hand, and possibly<br />\nwe may soon be able to give to the reading public a collection of short stories.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nHE Musical Clubs desire to extend their thanks, through the columns of<br />\nthe NEWS LETTER, to all those members of the Faculty and student body<br />\nwho by their large attendance made the Baltimore Concert such a success.<br />\nThe encouragement of a crowded house doubly recompensed the members, leaders and managers for their work and trouble; for the shekels gathered in were<br />\nso many that not only have all the Club debts been paid off, but a substantial<br />\nsurplus remains towards defraying the expenses of the Easter trip to Old Point.<br />\nIf this in turn is successful, it will again be the pleasure of the Clubs to aid<br />\nsome department of athletics as they did last year, when, in addition to the<br />\nathletic concert, $100.00 was given to the training table fund.<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nITH its last issue, the special celebration number, the NEws-Livrrim<br />\nreached the highest point of its circulation. A great many extra copies<br />\nwere sold to those who wished to preserve a compact account of the exercises. These have gone in all directions, one as far as the Philippines Islands.<br />\nThis climax of circulation and expansion, however, comes at a time when the<br />\nstaff is about to be weakened by the loss of some of its members. The paper<br />\nwill, as usual, be handed over to the Junior class at Easter, and the resignation<br />\nat that time of four Senior members of the board will leave as many positions<br />\nvacant.<br />\nIn the competition which has just closed, some very creditable work was<br />\ndone, and several of those who were passed over can continue their efforts with a<br />\ngood chance of success. But it must not be thought that the opportunity of<br />\nsecuring a place is in any way narrowed down. We would like to hear from<br />\nany and every student who has an idea for a humorous sketch, a poem, a story,<br />\nor who can furnish news notes of alumni, etc., or wishes to take a trial assignment to cover some college event.<br /><br />\n(W<br /><br />\nTHE CONCERT OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nRIDAY evening, February 14, the annual concert of the t iopkins Musical<br />\nClubs was held at Lehmann'g Hall. The hall was splendidly filled, even<br />\nthe gallery being crowded. Over a hundred girls from the Woman's Col<br />\nlege, delegations from various schools, along with many of this season's debutantes and next year's, were in the audience. The walls were well decorated,<br />\nbut not quite as attractively as the auditorium itself.<br />\nEverything went off as smoothly as could be desired. The program opened<br />\nwith the Glee Club singing The 'Varsity Ode, the soberness of which was relieved by the encore which they sang. Then came ''The Mosquito Parade,\"<br />\nby the Banjo Club, followed by the \"Invincible Eagle,\" played by the Mandolin Club. Mr. Gilman, of the Medical School, then sang three very effective<br />\nnumbers. He has a splendid, round, full voice, well under control. It lacks<br />\nonly dramatic fire. His song of the \"Blacksmith\" was by far the best he<br />\nrendered. Mr. Edgeworth Smith's \"The Ragged Raglan,\" played in a dashing<br />\nmanner by the Banjo Club, won great applause, as did J. H. Iiager's \"1902<br />\nMedley.\" Then Mr. Edgeworth Smith (lid a difficult turn with the banjo.<br />\nMr. Atkinson's coon songs seemed to please everybody. The program ended<br />\nwith W. B. Carver's 'Alma rater in Dixie Land,\" which is not as affective by<br />\nthe clubs as on the field.<br />\nFrom a musical standpoint, the Banjo Club deserves the most praise. They<br />\nhave been well trained, and seemed to understand and to have confidence in<br />\ntheir leader. They played with great spirit and dash. The volume and roundness of their tone was always good. The Mandolin Club played fairly well,<br />\nbut at times they were lacking in volume and unity of tone. The Glee Club is<br />\nin had need of more tenors. There was a heavy strain on that \"part of the club<br />\nwhich caused too great an effort, the high notes being left almost entirely to<br />\nMr. Carver.<br />\nAll in all it was a most satisfactory concert.

The discussion at the Chicago meeting was on the requirement<br />\nof a dissertation for the degree of doctor of philosophy, and the additional requisite that his treatise be published.

They now play as if they were beginning to<br />\nsee through the game, and are doing more of the quick passing which, heretofore, has helped Hopkins to outplay weight.<br />\nAmong those who have played before this year, but not on the team, Sidney Smith, Bird, Bryan, and Custis are forging to the front. Smith has been<br />\nplaying a good, heady game on the attack; but during the last week he has been<br />\na little off color. Bird and Bryan are both making a good showing, but still<br />\nhave something to learn. The former's fault seems to be the lack of clean stickwork; his idea of team work is good, but owing to a hitch in his passing he cannot always carry it out. This trouble ought to be adjusted by practice. As for<br />\nBryan, he shows good ability to catch and pass the ball when it is put to him;<br />\nbut he does not fight hard enough to get it himself. Custis is daily improving<br />\nin his stickwork, but has not reached the perfection mark yet. He is being<br />\ntried out on the defense. It is hoped that he will make a better showing when<br />\nout-door practice begins.<br />\nOf the new men at the game, S. Pearre, Matthai, and Blanck are the only<br />\nones in the race, Pearre has been alternating between in and out-home and<br />\nought to make a good one next year. He is playing a clever game. Much the<br />\nsame may be said about Matthai; he has been playing at centre and third attack. Blanck, our foot ball captain, is making a creditable showing at close<br />\ndefense. He is playing a hard and heady game; and if he can bring his stickwork up to the required standard, he will probably help Hopkins in her games<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nthis year.<br />\nThe old men all seem to be improving, but they never do play their game<br />\nuntil they get out of doors. The Cage seems to lower their lacrosse ability.<br />\nThe great thing which worries the coaches now is to find the combination<br />\nwhich will make the best team They have plenty of material for the attack<br />\nand the defense, but as always they are a little shy on good goal-keepers.<br />\nBriscoe, who played in many of the games last year, has been out as often as<br />\nhis work at the Medical School will permit. Pets and P. Straus are both nervy<br />\nplayers, but lack experience. Captain Schmeisser, who played goal until late<br />\nin his freshman year, has again been trying to get his eye in so that he may be<br />\nable, in case of necessity, to fill the position.<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nAlthough it is still very early and always dangerous to make predictions,<br />\nespecially when the men have had no outdoor practice, yet the NEWS LETER<br />\nwould like to predict that the team will be selected from the following men:<br />\nAbercrombie, W. Sehmeisser, Straus, B. Bernheitn, P. Bernheim, Briscoe,<br />\nPutts, E. Schtneisser, Tough, Sayler, Bird, Smith, Bryan, Custis, Blanck,<br />\nPearre, Pels, P. Straus, Matthai.<br />\nAs soon as the snow gets off the ground, the team will begin to practice at<br />\nthe American League Park. Here the real practice commences, the practice<br />\nthat will mean the winning or losing of the championship. It is hoped that the<br />\nattendance will be large enough to give the \"'Varsity\" a good scrub to play<br />\nagainst each day.<br /><br />\nBASE BALL.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE response to the call for candidates made on February 15 has been so<br />\nhearty and so well sustained that the success of the team promises to be a<br />\nquestion of degree. On Tuesdays Thursdays, and Saturdays the squad<br />\nhas practice, and on no afternoon have less than fifteen men been out, the number being frequently twenty or more. It seems absurd that Hopkins cannot<br />\nnow equal her former reputation in base ball. This inability appears about to<br />\nbe ended. The season will soon begin, and sp far there has been no flagging<br />\nin interest. The outcome of the whole movement now lies almost altogether<br />\nwith the men themselves. Heretofore, lack of grounds has proved a stumbling<br />\nblock; but this year outdoor grounds and all other essential conditions have<br />\nbeen provided for. The opportunity is certainly excellent.<br />\nThe team is fortunate in having as manager Mr. Maurice Lazenby, of the<br />\nMedical School, who was elected at the first meeting of the candidates. Mr.<br />\nLazenby has been active for several years in promoting the success of athletics<br />\nat Hopkins, and his service in this new cause goes to swell a long list of former<br />\nservices. He has named, as his assistants, L. M. R. Willis and J N. Numsen, '04.<br />\nAs for the men themselves, nothing need be feared, except possible listlessness. There is no sign of this at present. Work in the Cage consists of<br />\nhandling batted balls, of getting arms into condition, and of batting. This last<br />\nexercise should have telling effect. No college in the country has such a place<br />\nto train batters. The infield positions are aspired to by as many as ten men,<br />\nand there are tried men for the outfield The pitchers are in good condition,<br />\nand give promise of making conquests. Both of them have good curves, with<br />\nspeed and control.<br />\nThe schedule, as partially arranged, includes games at home with Princeton and Georgetown, and abroad with Rock Hill, the Naval Cadets (probably),<br />\nMaryland Agricultural College, and Western Maryland College.<br />\nIn view of this auspicious beginning, every lover of college sport at Hopkins<br />\nought to be loyal and stand behind the new effort, so that it does not fail.

The name\u2014The Senior Club\u2014has been decided upon,<br />\na constitution has been drawn up, and all that remains to make the the project<br />\na reality is to select suitable quarters and begin the collection of dues. Every<br />\n1903 man has exhibited the usual class spirit by signing a slip stating that he<br />\nwill contribute financially and otherwise to the success of the new organization,<br />\nand failure is out of the question. The club is to be strictly a senior institution<br />\nas the name signifies, and will be kept up each year by the graduating class at<br />\nthe University. Those who take degrees will be numbered thereafter among<br />\nits honorary members.<br />\nIt is not improbable that the idea was suggested by President Remsen's<br />\nshort address at the annual athletic feed. In speaking of student organizations<br />\nfor the promotion of social intercourse he referred in the highest terms to the<br />\nHouston Club of the University of Pennsylvania and expressed a wish that<br />\nHopkins might, sometime, have a similar organization.<br />\nTo those who have visited the magnificent quarters of the students at<br />\nPennsylvania, our chances for such a club in the near future seem very slight.<br />\nEverything has a beginning, however, and some day may find the Senior Club<br />\nhandsomely located among the many imposing buildings at Homewood.<br />\nIn recognition of their work, the junior class elected the ten men, who have<br />\ncrystallized the plans as members of the first board of governors. They will<br />\nassume active control next October, when the club will begin its existence.<br />\nThey are: H. W Plaggemeyer, R. C. Hoffman, Jr., J. A. Addison, secretary;<br />\nH. K.
