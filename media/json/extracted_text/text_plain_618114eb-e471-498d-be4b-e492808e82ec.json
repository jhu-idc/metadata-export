He also observed that<br />\nHopkins allows its<br />\nundergraduates to pile up credits<br />\nand take too many courses. As a<br />\nresult, he said,\"attention is<br />\nfragmented. A student can't<br />\nwork as intensively on any one<br />\ncourse or on independent study<br />\nprojects as at places where the<br />\ncourse load is more<br />\nconcentrated.\"<br />\nDr. Holland nonetheless<br />\nexpressed full confidence in<br />\nHopkins' student body. \"They're<br />\na lively, intelligent bunch of<br />\nundergraduates here,\" he said.

But these closer ties also<br />\nhave dangerous overtones. Under the the new system,<br />\nthe administration would have the power to reduce the<br />\namounts of money for student activities New<br />\nHomewood Vice President George Benton would<br />\nexercise this power. Though the administration could<br />\nsupposedly dictate only the total amount, it is clear<br />\nthat Benton could have significant say-so on budgets.<br />\nStudent organizations could breath a lot easier if the<br />\nadministration would agree to a minimum amount for<br />\nthe student budgets. A figure equivilent to $20 for<br />\neach student on the Homewood campus seems<br />\nreasonable.<br />\nThe administration has not justified an extension of<br />\ngood faith from students on this issue. Their actions<br />\nover the past few years in reducing their contribution<br />\nto the activities fund has forced the necessity for<br />\nchanging the current set-up. It is clear that the<br />\nadministration wants to have the purse strings in its<br />\nhands, and unless some safeguards go along, the<br />\nsituation could be disastrous for campus life.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nFascism<br />\nFascism is a term enjoying a great<br />\nrebirth of popularity in these United<br />\nStates. The counter-culture marks as<br />\nfascist anything from short hair to patio<br />\ncookouts to policemen, in short, any<br />\naspect of a \"lifestyle\" which conflicts<br />\nwith its own. At their most rigorous, the<br />\napolitical anarchists a la Abbie Hoffman<br />\nequate fascism with \"repression.\" But<br />\nfascism is not synonomous with even the<br />\nmost brutal police-state tactics. It is not a<br />\n\"conspiracy \u2014 put over on an<br />\nunsuspecting populace by the right wing.<br />\nFascism is an insidious grass-roots<br />\nmovement, which can grow only in a<br />\nsociety in a state of economic and social<br />\ndecomposition. It requires the consent of<br />\ndemoralized masses of the population for<br />\nits implementation. And it is the logical<br />\n\"final solution\" to the problem now<br />\nfacing the capitalist class as a whole: how<br />\nto back up counting paper values in a<br />\nsystem which has made no provision for<br />\n<br />\nfreaks, the drug addicts looking \"inward\"<br />\nfor an identity of which society has<br />\nrobbed them). Their desperation leads<br />\nthem into one blind alley after another as<br />\nthey deal with their identity-crisis in the<br />\nonly way they know, anarchistically. The<br />\nspectacle often has its tragi-comic side:<br />\nWe find the Big Daddy of the<br />\ncounter-culture, Bob Dylan, and his<br />\nfollowers, rubbing musical shoulders with<br />\nthe country-and-western \"fascists.\" Merle<br />\nHaggart of Okie from Muskogie\" fame<br />\nmust have \"dug\" The Band and Joan<br />\nBaez doing \"The Night They Drove Old<br />\nDixie Down.\" The Stones and Hell's<br />\nAngels made a not-so-unbelievable pair at<br />\nAltamont: both are leading lights of<br />\nanarchistic responses to a non-productive,<br />\nworn-out culture. You don't have to wear<br />\nan Iron Cross to get in step with this<br />\nyear's proto-fascist styles. Such alienated<br />\ntendencies, dangerous as they are,<br />\ncannot,however, guarantee the victory of<br />\n<br />\nincreased teal production, which has<br />\ngrown by looting non-capitalist sectors<br />\n<br />\ntXxe<br />\nk\u2022ascWca axv& kVe. exvAaveme,c\u2018t<br />\nworking class.

At such a stage, capitalism<br />\nturns cannibalistic, eating up its last<br />\navailable resource: its own working class.<br />\nIt must get more work out of the<br />\nproductive force, at a lower cost. That<br />\nmeans driving down the living standards<br />\nof the working class; it means breading<br />\nthe institutions which defend the<br />\ninterests of the workers: it means<br />\nresorting to slave labor and the<br />\nsubsequent \"disposal\" of the workers<br />\nwhen they are used up. The Germans<br />\nused all these tactics in the 1,930's. The<br />\n\u2022 U.S. ruling class is beginning to follow<br />\nsuit, with its Phase II for labor and<br />\n\"workfare\" plans for welfare<br />\nrecipients. The very real material<br />\nconditions of life in this period must<br />\nnecessarily find their reflection in the<br />\nsocial and cultural institutions through<br />\nwhich the population mediates its<br />\nexistence. The fragmentation of the<br />\ncapitalist system of production has<br />\nproduced corresponding anarchistic<br />\nalientated expressions in its social and<br />\nartistic life. The most \"apolitical\" hippie<br />\nor the \"art for art's sake\" aesthete are<br />\nsuch expressions of social decadence.<br />\nWhile they do embody the crisis of the<br />\nsociety, they in no way represent creative<br />\nsolutions to it. Their alienation, is<br />\nvariously expressed in passivity, in<br />\nanti-social theatrics, in illusion-building<br />\n(the \"back-to-nature\" set, the Jesus<br />\n<br />\nblackout<br />\n<br />\ncapitalist crisis. The real artist is called<br />\nupon in this period to continue his<br />\ndevelopment in the context of the<br />\nworking-class struggle. This does not<br />\nmean producing \"political\" murals and<br />\n\"Red\" ballets. It means locating ones<br />\ncreative energies in political activity,<br />\nforging a new socialist identity rather<br />\nthan lapsing into the bourgeois<br />\n\"alternatives\" of alienated extremism.<br />\nThe analysis of capitalist culture and<br />\nthe socialist perspective form the basis<br />\nfor a forum series to be presented by the<br />\nBaltimore Labor Committee of the<br />\nNational Caucus of Labor Committees<br />\nthis month at Johns Hopkins. The<br />\nforums, (which will also be given at<br />\nUniversity of Maryland) will begin at<br />\nHopkins March 8, when composer<br />\nChristine Berl will discuss The<br />\nCounterculture: Final Stage of<br />\nModernism. The following Wednesday,<br />\nMarch 15, Costos Axios who was exiled<br />\nfrom Greece, will present a paper on<br />\nFascism, and the final forum, March 22,<br />\nwill be given by Dr. D.S.

Today's colunm is by Becky<br />\nTaksel.<br />\n<br />\nA further example of the administration's lack of<br />\nconcern for students comes with the near-blackout on<br />\npublicity for the trustee election. Chiefly responsible<br />\nfor this fiasco appears to be University Secretary<br />\nVictor Dates, who is head of the Supervisory<br />\nCommittee which was supposed to run the first<br />\nelection of a, young trustee in the University's history.<br />\nThe result of seeming administration incompetence<br />\nwas that many of the candidates themselves had no<br />\nidea when the voting was scheduled to take place, and<br />\nthe voting had to be extended until today. The<br />\nextended voting came about largely as a result of<br />\nintervention by the two young graduates appointed by<br />\nMilton Eisenhower last year. Although every candidate<br />\ncriticized the failure of the administration to promote<br />\nthis crucial vote, Dates still insists at this late date that<br />\nthe publicity was adequate and that he heard no<br />\ncomplaints. Whether Dates, as University spokesman,<br />\nis deliberately deceptive or merely foolish is open to<br />\nquestion, but the University's irresponsibility<br />\nillustrates once again that students cannot trust the<br />\nadministration to handle their affairs. The voting,<br />\nincidentally, is slated from 10 am to 1 pm, and 5:30<br />\npm to 8:30 pm today in the M.S.E. Library.<br />\nThe voting cover-up could easily be an extension of<br />\nthe Trustees' desire to have a seinblance of student<br />\n<br />\nHoule and Wilbaux troupe<br />\n<br />\n1r1110,1<br />\n_ \u2022-<br />\n<br />\n-\u2022 -<br />\n<br />\n:--=.<br />\n<br />\nI.<br />\n<br />\n'Aisr<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\n\u2018.7)<br />\n<br />\n-4*<br />\n<br />\nparticipation while still reserving the final decision for<br />\n<br />\nthemselves. The two young trustees, Steve Mahinka<br />\nand Russ Passarella, are to be thanked for whatever<br />\ndemocracy this election retains. But student<br />\nparticipation remains a myth at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nL\u2022vtf<br />\n<br />\nwilrftvg4<br />\n<br />\n(Herblock is on vacation)<br />\n<br />\nTrue confessions: escape from the gatehouse<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nHopkins was supposed to be busted up<br />\nafter we got through with it. Instead, I<br />\nended up writing editorials saying what a<br />\nnice building the student union was going<br />\nto be. Something went very wrong along<br />\nthe way.<br />\nMaybe it had something to do with<br />\nEisenhower. His brother, Dwight, you<br />\nmay remember, did a decade's worth of<br />\nfrontal lobotomy work from which the<br />\nnation still hasn't recovered. The day we<br />\ntook over, our main man, Lincoln<br />\nGordon, quit on us, due in no small part<br />\nto the noted George Owen mouthpiece,<br />\nMark Reutter, our gifted predecessor.<br />\nEisenhower returned with garlands at his<br />\nfeet and angels singing in the clouds. We<br />\nhad to find something to write about. A<br />\nprelude to our vigorous coverage came<br />\nwith an early piece I wrote on the Great<br />\nCharmer, headlined, \"Eisenhower: One<br />\nof The Very Great.\" The quote wasn't<br />\nmine, but it might have been for all the<br />\n<br />\nRumors of Gordon's impending demise<br />\ndrifted down to us the week of our<br />\nelection to the N-L's top slots. The night<br />\nbefore Gordon was officially canned, I<br />\nhad, by sheerest accident, actually read<br />\nMark's ongoing saga, as well as Dick<br />\nCramer's excellent piece on JHU's<br />\nfinancial troubles that he wrote for<br />\nBaltimore Magazine. The Cramer piece,<br />\nincidentally, was lambasted by Milton<br />\nThe E. for \"inaccuracies in every<br />\nparagraph\" and our civic-minded former<br />\npresident had an important role in the<br />\nrecent firing of the magazine's crusading<br />\n<br />\nthe 1971 school year. For a while, Hill<br />\nexpertly treaded water with a series of<br />\nEisenhower-declines-comment stories<br />\nabout the interim presidency. Then, to<br />\nno one's surprise, Milton was picked to<br />\nsave the University. But the real break<br />\ncame when we were invited to a special<br />\noff-the-record session with the saviour<br />\nhimself\u2014and at his own spacious home,<br />\nright around the corner from Police Chief<br />\nDonald Pomerleau.<br />\nStories of Eisenhower's fabled charm<br />\nhad been passed on to us with a mixture<br />\nof dread and awe. Under no<br />\n<br />\nbudget, reduce his programs or even<br />\nmention his name, the valiant student<br />\npaper jumps into action, complete with<br />\nstock phrases for editorials on the threat<br />\nto \"Levering Hall's valuable<br />\nurban-involvement courses.\" \u2022<br />\nThe administration never learns. Each<br />\nyear it tries to make a move against some<br />\nWickwire program, and each year,<br />\nNews-Letter editors gladly take up the .<br />\nchallenge - and win. The reactions on<br />\nboth sides are automotic, and are<br />\nincluded in the student activity fee as<br />\npart of the News-Letter budget.<br />\nI thought that the big issue this year<br />\nwas going to be Macke Food. Over the<br />\nsummer, we heard strange tales of<br />\nworkers being fired and horrible new<br />\nmachines being installed. After a<br />\ndamaging piece I did for the first issue, I<br />\nexpected outraged students to burn down<br />\nthe cafeteria and stuff the Macke lady<br />\ninto a micro-wave oven. Nothing ever<br />\nhappened,<br />\n<br />\nslobbering I did.<br />\n<br />\nalthough<br />\n<br />\nwe<br />\n<br />\nran<br />\n<br />\narticles<br />\n<br />\npromotinv, a boycott. 1 knew then that<br />\n<br />\nttn:<br />\n<br />\nPt=<br />\n<br />\ntrue journalist, I was never satisfied until<br />\nI was aiming for the jugular, putting on<br />\nthe heat, screwing people to the wall and<br />\ngenerally exhausting myself. The sad part<br />\nof it was that I had been here since<br />\nSeptember, 1968 as a witness and<br />\nparticipant in the Hopkins protest<br />\nmovement, and knew what it was like to<br />\ngo on a newspaper rampage. The issues<br />\nand personalities parade before me now<br />\nlike a dated but hysterical newsreel:<br />\nDrugs! APL! In Loco Parentis! Gordon!<br />\nSteve Shriver! Boycotts! Injunction!<br />\nRecruiting! Gordon!<br />\nOnly a newsman can really appreciate<br />\nhow outstanding Gordon really was. He<br />\nwas ineffectual, pompous, conservative,<br />\nand, as an added bonus, a genuine pawn<br />\nof the military-industrial complex. His<br />\ncredentials were impeccable, and he 6<br />\nbacked them up with cowardly decisions<br />\nthat were fortunately wrong almost every<br />\ntime. I had no idea I would miss him so<br />\nmuch.<br />\nWhen Reutter began his series on<br />\nadministrative waste, the rest of us<br />\nthought that Mark had slipped into an<br />\nunfortunate personal decline, marked by<br />\nan obsessive interest in The Johns<br />\nHopkins Fund. Not counting Mark's<br />\nmother, there were perhaps ten people<br />\nwho read his stories, and they were all<br />\nsenior faculty members or worried<br />\nadministrators. But to everyone's<br />\nsurprise, Mark had hit on the issue that<br />\nwould be used by senior faculty<br />\nmembers, led by crafty George Benton,<br />\nin toppling our muddle-headed president.<br />\n<br />\nIt was, I had thought, a sure-tire issue.<br />\nPeople came in, purchased a<br />\nplastic-coated salisbury steak and heated<br />\n<br />\neditor. Anyway, I read all the material<br />\nfor a scheduled interview the next day<br />\nwith an administrator, at which time I<br />\nhoped to ask timid questions like \"Is it<br />\ntrue that there are some faculty members<br />\nwho are critical of our beloved<br />\npresident?\"<br />\nThe interview, natch, was cancelled<br />\nwhen the resignation news came down.<br />\nThe result was an exciting Hill-Levine<br />\nspecial edition. It included a perceptively<br />\nwritten neOs analysis which closely<br />\nfollowed the story-line of \"Julius<br />\nCeasar.\"<br />\nBut we needed more than Gordon's.<br />\ndownfall to keep us going for the rest of<br />\n<br />\nA superb pair of mimists and pantomimists<br />\nBy RICHARD ROSENTHAL<br />\nIn the opening act a girl crouches, head<br />\nburied, in the middle of a bare stage. The<br />\nonly sound in the theater is the recording<br />\nof Rachmaninoff's second concerto, to<br />\nwhich Sophie Wilbaux slowly and<br />\nsteadily reacts. She gradually comes to<br />\nlife, one muscle at a time, her movements<br />\ntimed precisely to the accents of the<br />\nmusic. All other parts of her body<br />\nmaintain flawless rigidity. This was<br />\n'Dark Night', the first of several mimes<br />\nand pantomimes performed by Bert<br />\nHoule and Sophie Wilbaux in \"An<br />\nEvening of Mime\", which ran last week at<br />\nBaltimore's Center Stage.<br />\nThe next number,'The Stranger', was<br />\nperformed by both artists in total silence.<br />\nMiss Wilbaux assumes a contemplative<br />\npose and is slowly approached by Mr.<br />\nHoule who- to the absolute shock of the<br />\naudience- utters in a clear, loud voice:<br />\n\"Speak! Whom do you love, enigmatic<br />\nstranger?\" The audience is so well tuned<br />\nto the power of silent communication<br />\nthat the emergence of speech has a<br />\n<br />\nOpen For Business<br />\n<br />\nstartling effect.<br />\nIn 'Escape' the players, in black tights<br />\nIn the dialogue, a poem by Baudelaire, and white face, begin by standing frozen<br />\nWilbaux disclaims love of family, friends, facing the audience.

The<br />\nsee.<br />\nman then wraps a band around his arm<br />\nBert Houle and Sophie Wilbaux first<br />\nand shoots some heroin.

During the interview,<br />\nhe tried out on us the speech he was<br />\ngoing to deliver at Shriver Hall the next<br />\nweek, but did it in a manner that made us<br />\nbelieve we were privy to the inside dope.<br />\nHill's eyes steadily widened with wonder<br />\nand religious ecstasy as Eisenhower<br />\ntalked, with Milton puffing regally on his<br />\n38-foot cigarette. I was getting desperate<br />\nfor tough questions. \"What about those<br />\nU-2 fighters?\" I asked. The interview<br />\nended in turmoil as Hill and I fought each<br />\nother to light a new Silva Thin for<br />\nEisenhower.<br />\nOur major problem was that there<br />\nwasn't that much we could attack, now<br />\nthat Maurice Chevalier was back at the<br />\nhelm. Benton did not cut any new<br />\ndepartments, and Muller did nothing<br />\nwrong except made some of us<br />\nsuspicious. We started scrounging for<br />\nsomething to get him on, but we couldn't<br />\ncome up with anything. Right before<br />\nMuller was about to be interviewed by<br />\nthe Trustees, one morose member of the<br />\nadvisory group entered the office seeking<br />\ndamaging information. \"Got anything on<br />\nMuller?\" he whined.<br />\nWe racked our brains: Muller smiled<br />\ntoo much, he had shifty eyes, and he had<br />\na pimple on his nose. The selection panel<br />\nwould not be impressed with our<br />\nfindings, we realized.<br />\nHardy Topics<br />\nLast spring, though, provided us with<br />\nsome hardy topics that would last for<br />\nyears. Evergreens like the Blue Ribbon<br />\nPanel and Zdanis-Wickwire controversy<br />\nkept us occupied, and still do. I was<br />\nespecially fond of the Wickwire issue<br />\nbecause it was so easy. Wickwire has been<br />\nadopted by the News-Letter as the<br />\nunderdog-in-residence every year. Any<br />\ntime the administration tries to lower his<br />\n<br />\nit up in the oven. You sat down and<br />\nglumly ate the first piece. Then you<br />\nturned to your neighbor and said,<br />\n\"Excuse me, Fred, there are lumps of<br />\ncatshit in my food.\" It was so outrageous,<br />\nthat insane cafeteria, but it met no<br />\nresistance from anyone. Its existence<br />\nrevealed how low and weak the student<br />\nmovement had become. This was not<br />\nsomething abstract, like ROTC, but,<br />\nsomething very concrete, and eating in:<br />\nthe new cafeteria was like having Dean<br />\nGeorge Benton personally dump a bucket<br />\nof warm urine on your head. Well, it dries<br />\nup after a while, sez the Aquarian Age<br />\nstudent with a big grin.<br />\nRemember East Baltimore security?<br />\nLazy Pinkertons standing idly by as<br />\nnurses are raped in broad daylight...car<br />\nthefts...administration waste? We gave<br />\nthat story \"extensive coverage,\"<br />\nelsewhere known as Beating a Dead<br />\nHorse. Actually, it was a good story, with<br />\nspecial kudos going to ex-guard Howard<br />\nWeaver. Although it was not a hot topic<br />\nof undergrad conversation, our constant<br />\nexposure scared both the administration<br />\nand Pinkerton, Inc. The series ran so long<br />\nthat Weaver, now 43 years old, completed<br />\nhis doctorate in statistics in order to<br />\nrebut Pinkerton's statistical arguments.<br />\nPinkerton also made veiled threats about<br />\nlibel suits in a meeting we had with some<br />\nof their top corporate officials.<br />\nOtherwise, our coverage was usually<br />\nadequate and thorough, but it lacked<br />\nspecial investigative stories and colorful<br />\nnews-features. Our attempts at in-depth<br />\nseries were failures, by and large, and we<br />\nhave yet to learn that the italicized<br />\nphrase first of a series, does not<br />\nautomatically guarentee a prize-winning<br />\nstory \u2022<br />\nThe prospect of a major fight with the<br />\nadministration over termpaper ads is<br />\nencouraging, with several on the paper<br />\neagerly fantasizing about the possibility<br />\nof going completely independent.

Jews<br />\nhas made Johns Hopkins'<br />\nbasketball a new game.<br />\nAfter a 35 point spree in his<br />\nfirst junior high school game, Bill<br />\ndecided that basketball was his<br />\nsport. He played all four years in<br />\nhigh school, leading his team<br />\nevery year in scoring and bringing<br />\nback 18-1,19-2, and 17-3 records<br />\n<br />\nfrom his sc,phomore through his<br />\nsenior years.<br />\nAn All-American from<br />\nCambridge High School in<br />\nCambridge, Maryland, Jews<br />\nreceived a score of offerings from<br />\nmany colleges, waving full<br />\nscholarships in his face, in order<br />\nto get him to come to their<br />\ninstitution and play ball for<br />\nthem. Lefty Driesell, coach of<br />\nthe nationally-ranked University<br />\nof Maryland, was among those<br />\nasking for Bill.<br />\nIt was quite coincidental that<br />\nhe chose Hopkins. The treasurer<br />\nof his student government and a<br />\nmember of National Honor<br />\nSociety, he was recommended to<br />\nformer Blue Jay coach Jim<br />\nValvano by the athletic director<br />\nof Bowie College, who was a<br />\ncoach at one of the Cambridge<br />\nhigh schools at the time. Coach<br />\nValvano watched Bill and was<br />\nimpressed by what he saw.<br />\nQuick Accessability<br />\nFour days after Jews'<br />\ngraduation from high school, his<br />\nfather died. This was probably<br />\nthe main factor in his decision to<br />\nattend Hopkins, since the<br />\nproximity of Baltimore to<br />\nCambridge would give him a<br />\nquick accessibility to home.<br />\nz Once Jews got here, though, it<br />\ng, was a little bit of a different<br />\nstory. Academically, he found<br />\nHopkins satisfying, while<br />\n<br />\nsocially, he felt very constrained.<br />\nMoreover, he was unhappy<br />\nwith the limited course selection<br />\nthat he had to choose from.<br />\nSickened by pre-med-throat-phobia, he wanted more liberal arts<br />\ncourses. As a result of all this,<br />\nBill didn't play basketball in his<br />\nfreshman year for what he<br />\ntermed \"academic priorities.\"<br />\nHe finally ended up content<br />\nwith his freshman grade point<br />\naverage, but socially and over all,<br />\nhe still wasn't satisfied. But now<br />\nthat he had adjusted<br />\nacademically, it was time to<br />\nexperiment\u2014to see whether<br />\nacademics and sports would mix.<br />\nThis year he returned to the<br />\ncages and found his studies and<br />\nthe hoops were miscible. He<br />\nresumed his place in the spotlight<br />\nand was the spark for most of<br />\nHopkins' wins. However, Bill<br />\nwasn't playing the way Bill Jews<br />\ncould play or the way he did in<br />\nhigh school.<br />\nMotivation<br />\n\"Motivation is the key to<br />\nathletics,\" he theorizes, \"and I<br />\njust don't have it.\" Bill was<br />\ndisappointed with the basketball<br />\nteam's season record and blames<br />\nit on his lack of incentive during<br />\nthe beginning of the season. He<br />\nfeels that his ability was hindered<br />\nby his lackidasical and passive<br />\nattitude. He found it hard to<br />\n<br />\nHopkins'center works nut in practice<br />\n<br />\nbecome mentally involved in a<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"Without the mental attitude,<br />\nthe physical performance suffers.<br />\nI was only up for a few games. In<br />\nhigh school, getting up was<br />\nautomatic; here I only .get up<br />\nduring big games.\"<br />\nBill believes that the basketball<br />\nprogram could be enhanced by a<br />\nbetter recruiting program,<br />\ninvolving more scholarship<br />\nofferings and an emphasis on the<br />\nliberal arts program. Most of the<br />\nathletes do not tend to be<br />\npre-meds, according to Jews, and<br />\nall the pre-med courses tend to<br />\n<br />\nscare away prospective athletes.<br />\nWhen asked about Coach<br />\nRupert, Bill replied,\"Because the<br />\nprimary emphasis in the school<br />\nisn't athletics, Coach Rupert has<br />\na hard job. He is mostly a<br />\npersonal friend of each of the<br />\nplayers rather than an athletic<br />\ncoach to them.\"<br />\n\"On a personal level, the<br />\npeople at Hopkins, from the<br />\nacademic counselors to the<br />\nathletic personnel, are the finest<br />\ngroup of people I have ever met.<br />\nI only wish that I could have<br />\ncome in contact with them under<br />\ndifferent circumstances.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 10, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nBaseball<br />\n<br />\nCoach Cox contemplates coming campaign<br />\nBy STEVEN BROWN<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nbaseball season is rapidly<br />\napproaching and Coach Dennis<br />\nCox<br />\nentering the campaign<br />\nwith great optimism.<br />\nCoach Cox, after a few years<br />\naway from basefall, will attempt<br />\nto improve upon last year's losing<br />\nrecord, amounting to a mere six<br />\nwins.<br />\nCox, also the Blue Jay head<br />\nfootball coach, is undergoing a<br />\nreadjustment to the slow tempo<br />\nof baseball and the patience<br />\nrequired to coach the<br />\ncomparatively less action-packed<br />\nsport.<br />\nWith a squad numbering 25<br />\nplayers and no freshmen or jv<br />\nteam in existence.

North America.<br />\nFather Hecker's vision was a<br />\ncommunity that would \"meet the<br />\nneeds of the Church in each age<br />\nas they arise.\" For this reason<br />\nhe wanted the Paulists to be flexible, not wedded to specific<br />\nworks. A special project might<br />\nbe suitable for a particular time<br />\nand a given need, hut changing<br />\ntin i c..s would require different<br />\nt cchni,:ucs and approaches that<br />\nmight differ from age to age.<br />\nThat's why the Paulists are so<br />\nflexible. Whether a man is in a<br />\nparish, University Apostolate or<br />\nmission ...whether he is involved<br />\nin a narcotic panel or the Paulist<br />\npress, radio, films or television,<br />\nhe has the freedom to use his<br />\nown talents in his own way to<br />\nachieve his objectives.<br />\nPaulists are not custodians of<br />\nthe past, but explorers of the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nNow you know why we are<br />\ncalled \"modern.\"<br />\nFor more information about<br />\nthe Paulist priesthood write to:<br />\nRev.

The victory party at<br />\nthe Holiday Inn was in full stride,<br />\nas several hundred people pack<br />\nthe medium-sized ballroom<br />\nwaiting for the<br />\ncandidates\u2014winners now\u2014to<br />\narrive. Swimming through - the<br />\ncrowd, hand over hand, reaching,<br />\ntouching, shaking hands, the<br />\nnewly-elected President of the<br />\nCouncil entered the room<br />\nand headed for the rostrum.<br />\nWally Orlinsky, moon-shaped<br />\nface covered with sweat and<br />\nsmiles, knew everybody in the<br />\ncrowd. \"I'm the youngest old<br />\npolitical hack around,\" Orlinsky<br />\nsays. Grinning, waving, knowing<br />\neverybody's name, he looked the<br />\npart that night.<br />\n\"Politics is the last great game<br />\nof life allowed in America,\"<br />\nOrlinsky says. \"I'm having a great<br />\ntime.\u2014 Striding the crowded<br />\nplatform on election night or<br />\nsitting in his City Hall office, he<br />\nseems to be enjoying himself.<br />\n<br />\nOrlinsky lives and believes the<br />\nAmerican Myth: any boy can<br />\ngrow up to be president. \"When<br />\nsomebody tells me that you can't<br />\nmake it in the system, I say<br />\nbullshit. I have no political<br />\ntradition in my family, no<br />\npersonal wealth, no relatives in<br />\nBaltimore. Yet, I'm now the<br />\nsecond highest elected official in<br />\nthe seventh largest city in<br />\nAmerica\u2014one of the largest cities<br />\nin the world.\" He likes that idea.<br />\nIn his outer office hangs a<br />\nposter, quoting Janis Joplin,<br />\nwhich says, \"You better not<br />\ncompromise yourself. It's all you<br />\ngot.\"<br />\nI don't know what<br />\ncompromises I'll be called on to<br />\nmake. I hope I'll always make the<br />\nright decisions, but you can't tell;<br />\nlife is too fluid for that,\"<br />\nOrlinsky says.<br />\n\u2022 Other furnishings in his outer<br />\noffice dramatize his position as<br />\nnumber two man in Baltimore<br />\npolitics. His two secretaries sit at<br />\nidentical desks on opposite sides<br />\nof the room, carpeted<br />\nwall-to-wall with institutional<br />\ngreen. One of the posters on the<br />\nwall is a quote from Camus; the<br />\n\u2022\"'FIRM<br />\n<br />\n\"Politics is the last great game of life.\"<br />\n<br />\ndesks are emblazoned with what he calls the \"smallest base<br />\ndecals, bearing the flag and the of supporters ever to win a major<br />\nwords \"So Proudly We Hail.\"<br />\nelection.\" He left the House,<br />\nThe inner office, where because, \"There are 142<br />\nOrlinsky reclines in a big leather delegates in the House; there's<br />\nchair, is cluttered with the kinds only one president of the<br />\nof things you might expect in the Baltimore City Council.\"<br />\noffice of a man who has been<br />\nAlthough infatuated with his<br />\ninvolved in politics, he says, personal role in politics, there is<br />\n\"since I was nine years old.\" more to Orlinsky's political<br />\nPoster sized pictures of the operation than that. \"I have a<br />\nKennedys, a wall full of books philosophy,\" he says, \"that<br />\nwith titles like \"Ethnic Groups in government can be efficient as<br />\nthe City\" and a colorful print of well as sensitive; that government<br />\nDon Quixote contrast strangely can be productive rather than<br />\nwith a bust of W.C.

Yet he<br />\ndoesn't see the University as an<br />\nintegral part of Baltimore.<br />\n\"Hopkins has never been part of<br />\nthe city and never will be,\" he<br />\nsays flatly. \"For the University<br />\nto order faculty and or<br />\ndepartments to become involved<br />\nin the community would not<br />\nonly be wrong, but ultimately<br />\nself-defeating.\"<br />\nOrlinsky has little sympathy<br />\nfor students who want to alter<br />\nHopkins' structure. \"If you say<br />\n'Balls to academic acheivement,'<br />\nthen maybe you should go<br />\nsomewhere else.

He also observed that<br />\nHopkins allows its<br />\nundergraduates to pile up credits<br />\nand take too many courses. As a<br />\nresult, he said,\"attention is<br />\nfragmented. A student can't<br />\nwork as intensively on any one<br />\ncourse or on independent study<br />\nprojects as at places where the<br />\ncourse load is more<br />\nconcentrated.\"<br />\nDr. Holland nonetheless<br />\nexpressed full confidence in<br />\nHopkins' student body. \"They're<br />\na lively, intelligent bunch of<br />\nundergraduates here,\" he said. He<br />\nnoted, though, that \"they are too<br />\naccustomed to taking notes.<br />\nThere's less give and take than<br /><br />\nthere could be, if it were easier to<br />\nget in touch with them in class.\"<br />\nLaurence Holland is a student<br />\nof American Literature, and a<br />\nparticular enthusiast of Henry<br />\nJames.

Since this is the case,<br />\ngrad students should also be involved in the<br />\nadministrative matters.<br />\nUnder the new plan it is also possible that the closer<br />\nties with the administration could generate greater<br />\neffiency in budget planning. But these closer ties also<br />\nhave dangerous overtones. Under the the new system,<br />\nthe administration would have the power to reduce the<br />\namounts of money for student activities New<br />\nHomewood Vice President George Benton would<br />\nexercise this power. Though the administration could<br />\nsupposedly dictate only the total amount, it is clear<br />\nthat Benton could have significant say-so on budgets.<br />\nStudent organizations could breath a lot easier if the<br />\nadministration would agree to a minimum amount for<br />\nthe student budgets. A figure equivilent to $20 for<br />\neach student on the Homewood campus seems<br />\nreasonable.<br />\nThe administration has not justified an extension of<br />\ngood faith from students on this issue. Their actions<br />\nover the past few years in reducing their contribution<br />\nto the activities fund has forced the necessity for<br />\nchanging the current set-up. It is clear that the<br />\nadministration wants to have the purse strings in its<br />\nhands, and unless some safeguards go along, the<br />\nsituation could be disastrous for campus life.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nFascism<br />\nFascism is a term enjoying a great<br />\nrebirth of popularity in these United<br />\nStates. The counter-culture marks as<br />\nfascist anything from short hair to patio<br />\ncookouts to policemen, in short, any<br />\naspect of a \"lifestyle\" which conflicts<br />\nwith its own. At their most rigorous, the<br />\napolitical anarchists a la Abbie Hoffman<br />\nequate fascism with \"repression.\" But<br />\nfascism is not synonomous with even the<br />\nmost brutal police-state tactics. It is not a<br />\n\"conspiracy \u2014 put over on an<br />\nunsuspecting populace by the right wing.<br />\nFascism is an insidious grass-roots<br />\nmovement, which can grow only in a<br />\nsociety in a state of economic and social<br />\ndecomposition. It requires the consent of<br />\ndemoralized masses of the population for<br />\nits implementation. And it is the logical<br />\n\"final solution\" to the problem now<br />\nfacing the capitalist class as a whole: how<br />\nto back up counting paper values in a<br />\nsystem which has made no provision for<br /><br />\nfreaks, the drug addicts looking \"inward\"<br />\nfor an identity of which society has<br />\nrobbed them). Their desperation leads<br />\nthem into one blind alley after another as<br />\nthey deal with their identity-crisis in the<br />\nonly way they know, anarchistically. The<br />\nspectacle often has its tragi-comic side:<br />\nWe find the Big Daddy of the<br />\ncounter-culture, Bob Dylan, and his<br />\nfollowers, rubbing musical shoulders with<br />\nthe country-and-western \"fascists.\" Merle<br />\nHaggart of Okie from Muskogie\" fame<br />\nmust have \"dug\" The Band and Joan<br />\nBaez doing \"The Night They Drove Old<br />\nDixie Down.\" The Stones and Hell's<br />\nAngels made a not-so-unbelievable pair at<br />\nAltamont: both are leading lights of<br />\nanarchistic responses to a non-productive,<br />\nworn-out culture. You don't have to wear<br />\nan Iron Cross to get in step with this<br />\nyear's proto-fascist styles. Such alienated<br />\ntendencies, dangerous as they are,<br />\ncannot,however, guarantee the victory of<br /><br />\nincreased teal production, which has<br />\ngrown by looting non-capitalist sectors<br /><br />\ntXxe<br />\nk\u2022ascWca axv&amp; kVe. exvAaveme,c\u2018t<br />\nworking class. Building the socialist<br />\nalternative is the creative response to the<br /><br />\nand how finds those sectors \"dried-up,7<br />\nwhich has depleted its resources without<br />\ndeveloping the technology for their<br />\nreplacement. At such a stage, capitalism<br />\nturns cannibalistic, eating up its last<br />\navailable resource: its own working class.<br />\nIt must get more work out of the<br />\nproductive force, at a lower cost. That<br />\nmeans driving down the living standards<br />\nof the working class; it means breading<br />\nthe institutions which defend the<br />\ninterests of the workers: it means<br />\nresorting to slave labor and the<br />\nsubsequent \"disposal\" of the workers<br />\nwhen they are used up. The Germans<br />\nused all these tactics in the 1,930's. The<br />\n\u2022 U.S. ruling class is beginning to follow<br />\nsuit, with its Phase II for labor and<br />\n\"workfare\" plans for welfare<br />\nrecipients. The very real material<br />\nconditions of life in this period must<br />\nnecessarily find their reflection in the<br />\nsocial and cultural institutions through<br />\nwhich the population mediates its<br />\nexistence. The fragmentation of the<br />\ncapitalist system of production has<br />\nproduced corresponding anarchistic<br />\nalientated expressions in its social and<br />\nartistic life. The most \"apolitical\" hippie<br />\nor the \"art for art's sake\" aesthete are<br />\nsuch expressions of social decadence.<br />\nWhile they do embody the crisis of the<br />\nsociety, they in no way represent creative<br />\nsolutions to it. Their alienation, is<br />\nvariously expressed in passivity, in<br />\nanti-social theatrics, in illusion-building<br />\n(the \"back-to-nature\" set, the Jesus<br /><br />\nblackout<br /><br />\ncapitalist crisis. The real artist is called<br />\nupon in this period to continue his<br />\ndevelopment in the context of the<br />\nworking-class struggle. This does not<br />\nmean producing \"political\" murals and<br />\n\"Red\" ballets. It means locating ones<br />\ncreative energies in political activity,<br />\nforging a new socialist identity rather<br />\nthan lapsing into the bourgeois<br />\n\"alternatives\" of alienated extremism.<br />\nThe analysis of capitalist culture and<br />\nthe socialist perspective form the basis<br />\nfor a forum series to be presented by the<br />\nBaltimore Labor Committee of the<br />\nNational Caucus of Labor Committees<br />\nthis month at Johns Hopkins.

Today's colunm is by Becky<br />\nTaksel.<br /><br />\nA further example of the administration's lack of<br />\nconcern for students comes with the near-blackout on<br />\npublicity for the trustee election. Chiefly responsible<br />\nfor this fiasco appears to be University Secretary<br />\nVictor Dates, who is head of the Supervisory<br />\nCommittee which was supposed to run the first<br />\nelection of a, young trustee in the University's history.<br />\nThe result of seeming administration incompetence<br />\nwas that many of the candidates themselves had no<br />\nidea when the voting was scheduled to take place, and<br />\nthe voting had to be extended until today. The<br />\nextended voting came about largely as a result of<br />\nintervention by the two young graduates appointed by<br />\nMilton Eisenhower last year. Although every candidate<br />\ncriticized the failure of the administration to promote<br />\nthis crucial vote, Dates still insists at this late date that<br />\nthe publicity was adequate and that he heard no<br />\ncomplaints. Whether Dates, as University spokesman,<br />\nis deliberately deceptive or merely foolish is open to<br />\nquestion, but the University's irresponsibility<br />\nillustrates once again that students cannot trust the<br />\nadministration to handle their affairs. The voting,<br />\nincidentally, is slated from 10 am to 1 pm, and 5:30<br />\npm to 8:30 pm today in the M.S.E. Library.<br />\nThe voting cover-up could easily be an extension of<br />\nthe Trustees' desire to have a seinblance of student<br /><br />\nHoule and Wilbaux troupe<br /><br />\n1r1110,1<br />\n_ \u2022-<br /><br />\n-\u2022 -<br /><br />\n:--=.<br /><br />\nI.<br /><br />\n'Aisr<br /><br />\n,<br />\n'<br />\n\u2018.7)<br /><br />\n-4*<br /><br />\nparticipation while still reserving the final decision for<br /><br />\nthemselves.

Instead, I<br />\nended up writing editorials saying what a<br />\nnice building the student union was going<br />\nto be. Something went very wrong along<br />\nthe way.<br />\nMaybe it had something to do with<br />\nEisenhower. His brother, Dwight, you<br />\nmay remember, did a decade's worth of<br />\nfrontal lobotomy work from which the<br />\nnation still hasn't recovered. The day we<br />\ntook over, our main man, Lincoln<br />\nGordon, quit on us, due in no small part<br />\nto the noted George Owen mouthpiece,<br />\nMark Reutter, our gifted predecessor.<br />\nEisenhower returned with garlands at his<br />\nfeet and angels singing in the clouds. We<br />\nhad to find something to write about. A<br />\nprelude to our vigorous coverage came<br />\nwith an early piece I wrote on the Great<br />\nCharmer, headlined, \"Eisenhower: One<br />\nof The Very Great.\" The quote wasn't<br />\nmine, but it might have been for all the<br /><br />\nRumors of Gordon's impending demise<br />\ndrifted down to us the week of our<br />\nelection to the N-L's top slots. The night<br />\nbefore Gordon was officially canned, I<br />\nhad, by sheerest accident, actually read<br />\nMark's ongoing saga, as well as Dick<br />\nCramer's excellent piece on JHU's<br />\nfinancial troubles that he wrote for<br />\nBaltimore Magazine. The Cramer piece,<br />\nincidentally, was lambasted by Milton<br />\nThe E. for \"inaccuracies in every<br />\nparagraph\" and our civic-minded former<br />\npresident had an important role in the<br />\nrecent firing of the magazine's crusading<br /><br />\nthe 1971 school year. For a while, Hill<br />\nexpertly treaded water with a series of<br />\nEisenhower-declines-comment stories<br />\nabout the interim presidency. Then, to<br />\nno one's surprise, Milton was picked to<br />\nsave the University. But the real break<br />\ncame when we were invited to a special<br />\noff-the-record session with the saviour<br />\nhimself\u2014and at his own spacious home,<br />\nright around the corner from Police Chief<br />\nDonald Pomerleau.<br />\nStories of Eisenhower's fabled charm<br />\nhad been passed on to us with a mixture<br />\nof dread and awe. Under no<br /><br />\nbudget, reduce his programs or even<br />\nmention his name, the valiant student<br />\npaper jumps into action, complete with<br />\nstock phrases for editorials on the threat<br />\nto \"Levering Hall's valuable<br />\nurban-involvement courses.\" \u2022<br />\nThe administration never learns. Each<br />\nyear it tries to make a move against some<br />\nWickwire program, and each year,<br />\nNews-Letter editors gladly take up the .<br />\nchallenge - and win. The reactions on<br />\nboth sides are automotic, and are<br />\nincluded in the student activity fee as<br />\npart of the News-Letter budget.<br />\nI thought that the big issue this year<br />\nwas going to be Macke Food. Over the<br />\nsummer, we heard strange tales of<br />\nworkers being fired and horrible new<br />\nmachines being installed. After a<br />\ndamaging piece I did for the first issue, I<br />\nexpected outraged students to burn down<br />\nthe cafeteria and stuff the Macke lady<br />\ninto a micro-wave oven. Nothing ever<br />\nhappened,<br /><br />\nslobbering I did.<br /><br />\nalthough<br /><br />\nwe<br /><br />\nran<br /><br />\narticles<br /><br />\npromotinv, a boycott. 1 knew then that<br /><br />\nttn:<br /><br />\nPt=<br /><br />\ntrue journalist, I was never satisfied until<br />\nI was aiming for the jugular, putting on<br />\nthe heat, screwing people to the wall and<br />\ngenerally exhausting myself. The sad part<br />\nof it was that I had been here since<br />\nSeptember, 1968 as a witness and<br />\nparticipant in the Hopkins protest<br />\nmovement, and knew what it was like to<br />\ngo on a newspaper rampage. The issues<br />\nand personalities parade before me now<br />\nlike a dated but hysterical newsreel:<br />\nDrugs! APL! In Loco Parentis! Gordon!<br />\nSteve Shriver! Boycotts! Injunction!<br />\nRecruiting! Gordon!<br />\nOnly a newsman can really appreciate<br />\nhow outstanding Gordon really was. He<br />\nwas ineffectual, pompous, conservative,<br />\nand, as an added bonus, a genuine pawn<br />\nof the military-industrial complex. His<br />\ncredentials were impeccable, and he 6<br />\nbacked them up with cowardly decisions<br />\nthat were fortunately wrong almost every<br />\ntime. I had no idea I would miss him so<br />\nmuch.<br />\nWhen Reutter began his series on<br />\nadministrative waste, the rest of us<br />\nthought that Mark had slipped into an<br />\nunfortunate personal decline, marked by<br />\nan obsessive interest in The Johns<br />\nHopkins Fund. Not counting Mark's<br />\nmother, there were perhaps ten people<br />\nwho read his stories, and they were all<br />\nsenior faculty members or worried<br />\nadministrators. But to everyone's<br />\nsurprise, Mark had hit on the issue that<br />\nwould be used by senior faculty<br />\nmembers, led by crafty George Benton,<br />\nin toppling our muddle-headed president.<br /><br />\nIt was, I had thought, a sure-tire issue.<br />\nPeople came in, purchased a<br />\nplastic-coated salisbury steak and heated<br /><br />\neditor. Anyway, I read all the material<br />\nfor a scheduled interview the next day<br />\nwith an administrator, at which time I<br />\nhoped to ask timid questions like \"Is it<br />\ntrue that there are some faculty members<br />\nwho are critical of our beloved<br />\npresident?\"<br />\nThe interview, natch, was cancelled<br />\nwhen the resignation news came down.<br />\nThe result was an exciting Hill-Levine<br />\nspecial edition. It included a perceptively<br />\nwritten neOs analysis which closely<br />\nfollowed the story-line of \"Julius<br />\nCeasar.\"<br />\nBut we needed more than Gordon's.<br />\ndownfall to keep us going for the rest of<br /><br />\nA superb pair of mimists and pantomimists<br />\nBy RICHARD ROSENTHAL<br />\nIn the opening act a girl crouches, head<br />\nburied, in the middle of a bare stage. The<br />\nonly sound in the theater is the recording<br />\nof Rachmaninoff's second concerto, to<br />\nwhich Sophie Wilbaux slowly and<br />\nsteadily reacts. She gradually comes to<br />\nlife, one muscle at a time, her movements<br />\ntimed precisely to the accents of the<br />\nmusic. All other parts of her body<br />\nmaintain flawless rigidity. This was<br />\n'Dark Night', the first of several mimes<br />\nand pantomimes performed by Bert<br />\nHoule and Sophie Wilbaux in \"An<br />\nEvening of Mime\", which ran last week at<br />\nBaltimore's Center Stage.<br />\nThe next number,'The Stranger', was<br />\nperformed by both artists in total silence.<br />\nMiss Wilbaux assumes a contemplative<br />\npose and is slowly approached by Mr.<br />\nHoule who- to the absolute shock of the<br />\naudience- utters in a clear, loud voice:<br />\n\"Speak! Whom do you love, enigmatic<br />\nstranger?\" The audience is so well tuned<br />\nto the power of silent communication<br />\nthat the emergence of speech has a<br /><br />\nOpen For Business<br /><br />\nstartling effect.<br />\nIn 'Escape' the players, in black tights<br />\nIn the dialogue, a poem by Baudelaire, and white face, begin by standing frozen<br />\nWilbaux disclaims love of family, friends, facing the audience. Accompanied by<br />\ncountry, or gold, and states: \"I love the<br />\npounding rythms, they stealthily explore<br />\nclouds, the clouds that pass over there, their surroundings until they gradually<br />\nthe wonderful clouds.\" She repeats this<br />\ndiscover that they are surrounded by a<br />\nin French, her face and body raptuously<br />\nwall. They race around frantically, trying<br />\nknow<br />\nclouds<br />\nwe<br />\nshe<br />\ncan<br />\nreflecting the<br />\nto escape, then fall back defeated. The<br />\nsee.<br />\nman then wraps a band around his arm<br />\nBert Houle and Sophie Wilbaux first<br />\nand shoots some heroin. She follows suit,<br />\nlearned the art of conveying ideas<br />\nand they swoon and fly as the euphoria<br />\ngestures<br />\nin<br />\nmotions<br />\nand<br />\nParis.<br />\nhits. Before long they retch and shiver in<br />\nthrough<br />\nThey met there while studying under the pain of withdrawal. After they shoot<br />\nup a second time, the prisoners realize<br />\nEtiennne Decroux, teacher of Marcel<br />\nagain that they are enclosed, only this<br />\nMarceau.

During the interview,<br />\nhe tried out on us the speech he was<br />\ngoing to deliver at Shriver Hall the next<br />\nweek, but did it in a manner that made us<br />\nbelieve we were privy to the inside dope.<br />\nHill's eyes steadily widened with wonder<br />\nand religious ecstasy as Eisenhower<br />\ntalked, with Milton puffing regally on his<br />\n38-foot cigarette. I was getting desperate<br />\nfor tough questions. \"What about those<br />\nU-2 fighters?\" I asked. The interview<br />\nended in turmoil as Hill and I fought each<br />\nother to light a new Silva Thin for<br />\nEisenhower.<br />\nOur major problem was that there<br />\nwasn't that much we could attack, now<br />\nthat Maurice Chevalier was back at the<br />\nhelm. Benton did not cut any new<br />\ndepartments, and Muller did nothing<br />\nwrong except made some of us<br />\nsuspicious. We started scrounging for<br />\nsomething to get him on, but we couldn't<br />\ncome up with anything. Right before<br />\nMuller was about to be interviewed by<br />\nthe Trustees, one morose member of the<br />\nadvisory group entered the office seeking<br />\ndamaging information. \"Got anything on<br />\nMuller?\" he whined.<br />\nWe racked our brains: Muller smiled<br />\ntoo much, he had shifty eyes, and he had<br />\na pimple on his nose. The selection panel<br />\nwould not be impressed with our<br />\nfindings, we realized.<br />\nHardy Topics<br />\nLast spring, though, provided us with<br />\nsome hardy topics that would last for<br />\nyears. Evergreens like the Blue Ribbon<br />\nPanel and Zdanis-Wickwire controversy<br />\nkept us occupied, and still do. I was<br />\nespecially fond of the Wickwire issue<br />\nbecause it was so easy. Wickwire has been<br />\nadopted by the News-Letter as the<br />\nunderdog-in-residence every year. Any<br />\ntime the administration tries to lower his<br /><br />\nit up in the oven. You sat down and<br />\nglumly ate the first piece. Then you<br />\nturned to your neighbor and said,<br />\n\"Excuse me, Fred, there are lumps of<br />\ncatshit in my food.\" It was so outrageous,<br />\nthat insane cafeteria, but it met no<br />\nresistance from anyone. Its existence<br />\nrevealed how low and weak the student<br />\nmovement had become. This was not<br />\nsomething abstract, like ROTC, but,<br />\nsomething very concrete, and eating in:<br />\nthe new cafeteria was like having Dean<br />\nGeorge Benton personally dump a bucket<br />\nof warm urine on your head. Well, it dries<br />\nup after a while, sez the Aquarian Age<br />\nstudent with a big grin.<br />\nRemember East Baltimore security?<br />\nLazy Pinkertons standing idly by as<br />\nnurses are raped in broad daylight...car<br />\nthefts...administration waste? We gave<br />\nthat story \"extensive coverage,\"<br />\nelsewhere known as Beating a Dead<br />\nHorse. Actually, it was a good story, with<br />\nspecial kudos going to ex-guard Howard<br />\nWeaver. Although it was not a hot topic<br />\nof undergrad conversation, our constant<br />\nexposure scared both the administration<br />\nand Pinkerton, Inc. The series ran so long<br />\nthat Weaver, now 43 years old, completed<br />\nhis doctorate in statistics in order to<br />\nrebut Pinkerton's statistical arguments.<br />\nPinkerton also made veiled threats about<br />\nlibel suits in a meeting we had with some<br />\nof their top corporate officials.<br />\nOtherwise, our coverage was usually<br />\nadequate and thorough, but it lacked<br />\nspecial investigative stories and colorful<br />\nnews-features. Our attempts at in-depth<br />\nseries were failures, by and large, and we<br />\nhave yet to learn that the italicized<br />\nphrase first of a series, does not<br />\nautomatically guarentee a prize-winning<br />\nstory \u2022<br />\nThe prospect of a major fight with the<br />\nadministration over termpaper ads is<br />\nencouraging, with several on the paper<br />\neagerly fantasizing about the possibility<br />\nof going completely independent. Our<br />\npolicy of arrogant amorality prompted<br />\ntough Fred Dierman to write me, \"The<br />\nNews-letter (sic), which has a strong.<br />\ninfluence on student opinion, should get<br />\n. off the fence, stop publishing the<br />\n.term-paper ads, and take a stand in favor<br />\nof the maintenance of standards of<br />\nintellectual achievement at Hopkins. If it:<br />\ndoes not, perhaps the Honor<br />\nCommission will make itself heard on the<br />\nsubject.\" (emphasis added.) Such subtle'<br />\nthreats apparently weren't enough.

Jews<br />\nhas made Johns Hopkins'<br />\nbasketball a new game.<br />\nAfter a 35 point spree in his<br />\nfirst junior high school game, Bill<br />\ndecided that basketball was his<br />\nsport. He played all four years in<br />\nhigh school, leading his team<br />\nevery year in scoring and bringing<br />\nback 18-1,19-2, and 17-3 records<br /><br />\nfrom his sc,phomore through his<br />\nsenior years.<br />\nAn All-American from<br />\nCambridge High School in<br />\nCambridge, Maryland, Jews<br />\nreceived a score of offerings from<br />\nmany colleges, waving full<br />\nscholarships in his face, in order<br />\nto get him to come to their<br />\ninstitution and play ball for<br />\nthem. Lefty Driesell, coach of<br />\nthe nationally-ranked University<br />\nof Maryland, was among those<br />\nasking for Bill.<br />\nIt was quite coincidental that<br />\nhe chose Hopkins. The treasurer<br />\nof his student government and a<br />\nmember of National Honor<br />\nSociety, he was recommended to<br />\nformer Blue Jay coach Jim<br />\nValvano by the athletic director<br />\nof Bowie College, who was a<br />\ncoach at one of the Cambridge<br />\nhigh schools at the time. Coach<br />\nValvano watched Bill and was<br />\nimpressed by what he saw.<br />\nQuick Accessability<br />\nFour days after Jews'<br />\ngraduation from high school, his<br />\nfather died. This was probably<br />\nthe main factor in his decision to<br />\nattend Hopkins, since the<br />\nproximity of Baltimore to<br />\nCambridge would give him a<br />\nquick accessibility to home.<br />\nz Once Jews got here, though, it<br />\ng, was a little bit of a different<br />\nstory. Academically, he found<br />\nHopkins satisfying, while<br /><br />\nsocially, he felt very constrained.<br />\nMoreover, he was unhappy<br />\nwith the limited course selection<br />\nthat he had to choose from.<br />\nSickened by pre-med-throat-phobia, he wanted more liberal arts<br />\ncourses. As a result of all this,<br />\nBill didn't play basketball in his<br />\nfreshman year for what he<br />\ntermed \"academic priorities.\"<br />\nHe finally ended up content<br />\nwith his freshman grade point<br />\naverage, but socially and over all,<br />\nhe still wasn't satisfied. But now<br />\nthat he had adjusted<br />\nacademically, it was time to<br />\nexperiment\u2014to see whether<br />\nacademics and sports would mix.<br />\nThis year he returned to the<br />\ncages and found his studies and<br />\nthe hoops were miscible. He<br />\nresumed his place in the spotlight<br />\nand was the spark for most of<br />\nHopkins' wins. However, Bill<br />\nwasn't playing the way Bill Jews<br />\ncould play or the way he did in<br />\nhigh school.<br />\nMotivation<br />\n\"Motivation is the key to<br />\nathletics,\" he theorizes, \"and I<br />\njust don't have it.\" Bill was<br />\ndisappointed with the basketball<br />\nteam's season record and blames<br />\nit on his lack of incentive during<br />\nthe beginning of the season. He<br />\nfeels that his ability was hindered<br />\nby his lackidasical and passive<br />\nattitude. He found it hard to<br /><br />\nHopkins'center works nut in practice<br /><br />\nbecome mentally involved in a<br />\ngame.<br />\n\"Without the mental attitude,<br />\nthe physical performance suffers.<br />\nI was only up for a few games. In<br />\nhigh school, getting up was<br />\nautomatic; here I only .get up<br />\nduring big games.\"<br />\nBill believes that the basketball<br />\nprogram could be enhanced by a<br />\nbetter recruiting program,<br />\ninvolving more scholarship<br />\nofferings and an emphasis on the<br />\nliberal arts program. Most of the<br />\nathletes do not tend to be<br />\npre-meds, according to Jews, and<br />\nall the pre-med courses tend to<br /><br />\nscare away prospective athletes.<br />\nWhen asked about Coach<br />\nRupert, Bill replied,\"Because the<br />\nprimary emphasis in the school<br />\nisn't athletics, Coach Rupert has<br />\na hard job. He is mostly a<br />\npersonal friend of each of the<br />\nplayers rather than an athletic<br />\ncoach to them.\"<br />\n\"On a personal level, the<br />\npeople at Hopkins, from the<br />\nacademic counselors to the<br />\nathletic personnel, are the finest<br />\ngroup of people I have ever met.<br />\nI only wish that I could have<br />\ncome in contact with them under<br />\ndifferent circumstances.\"<br /><br />\nmarch 10, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\nBaseball<br /><br />\nCoach Cox contemplates coming campaign<br />\nBy STEVEN BROWN<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nbaseball season is rapidly<br />\napproaching and Coach Dennis<br />\nCox<br />\nentering the campaign<br />\nwith great optimism.<br />\nCoach Cox, after a few years<br />\naway from basefall, will attempt<br />\nto improve upon last year's losing<br />\nrecord, amounting to a mere six<br />\nwins.<br />\nCox, also the Blue Jay head<br />\nfootball coach, is undergoing a<br />\nreadjustment to the slow tempo<br />\nof baseball and the patience<br />\nrequired to coach the<br />\ncomparatively less action-packed<br />\nsport.<br />\nWith a squad numbering 25<br />\nplayers and no freshmen or jv<br />\nteam in existence.
