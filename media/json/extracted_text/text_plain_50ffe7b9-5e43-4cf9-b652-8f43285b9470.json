Professor Aihud Pevsner<br />\nsaid: \"The goal of the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee was to request letters<br />\nof recommendation from leading<br />\nscholars around the country, to<br />\nevaluate these letters, and to<br />\nmake its recommendation to the<br />\nAcademic Council. We took very<br />\nseriously what the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee said, and I believed<br />\nthe decision was arrived at<br />\nfairly.\"<br />\nNeither the ad hoc committee<br />\nnor the Academic Council could<br />\ndetermine unanimously what<br />\npart of Dr. Pfeffer's work ought<br />\nto be most important in<br />\nevaluating his request for tenure.<br />\nFrom his arrival at Johns<br />\nHopkins in 1969 until 1973,<br />\nProfessor Pfeffer specialized in<br />\nChinese socialism; in 1973 he<br />\nwent on sabbatical to work in a<br />\nfactory, and since then he has<br />\nspent more time examining<br />\nAmerican capitalism.<br />\nAs a result, the focus of his<br />\nwritings shifted during his years<br />\nat Hopkins. These writings<br />\ninclude articles on China studies<br />\nthroughout his nine years here,<br />\nand a manuscript tentatively<br />\nentitled Working For Capiralistn,<br />\nscheduled to be published by<br />\n,Columbia University Press.<br />\nAlmost all of the letters the<br />\ncommittee received on Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's work on China studies<br />\n<br />\nwere favorable, but those letters<br />\ndealing with his book were fewer<br />\nand more critical. An added<br />\nfactor in this case, and one which<br />\nsome students emphasized, is<br />\nthat Dr. Pfeffer is an outstanding<br />\nteacher.<br />\nFaced with these<br />\nconsiderations, the majority of<br />\ncommittee and Council members<br />\nconcluded that Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nearlier articles on China studies<br />\nwere irrelevant, that his later<br />\nmanuscript was not an exemplary<br />\npiece of scholarship, and that nis<br />\nteaching excellence could not be<br />\n,judged accurately and thus was<br />\nof minor importance.<br />\nWhen informed of the<br />\nCommittee's findings, Dr. Pfeffer<br />\nwas upset that his earlier work<br />\nhad been disregarded and that us<br />\nteaching skills had played no real<br />\npart in the proceedings.' In<br />\nexplaining the shift in his studies<br />\nseveral years ago from China to<br />\nAmerica, he said that in order to<br />\nunderstand Chinese socialism and<br />\nMarxism more fully, he felt it<br />\nwas necessary to devote several<br />\nyears to the study of American<br />\ncapitalism. He also pointed out<br />\nthat his work on China had by no<br />\nmeans stopped since 1972. \"In<br />\nOctober, 1976, I wrote a forty<br />\npage article on Mao which<br />\ntouched off a major debate<br />\namong scholars around the<br />\ncountry.

But the concept<br />\nof a \"Night School\" lives on, in<br />\nthe form of a new proposal to<br />\nallow more part-time and<br />\nnon-degree students.<br />\n\"Night School\" is a symbolic<br />\nterm at SAIS. For the<br />\nadministration, it means utilizing<br />\nthe school classroom facilities<br />\nwhen they are currently<br />\nunderused by the existing<br />\nprograms. For the administrative<br />\nstaff, \"Night School\" has implied<br />\nan increased workload where the<br />\npresent facilities are already<br />\ncramped. For sonic of the<br />\nfaculty, it means the opportunity<br />\nto teach additional sections of<br />\noverenrolled courses with the<br />\nconcomitant increased pay. And<br />\nfor students \"Night School\"<br />\nconjures up images of larger<br />\nclasses, less space in the library<br />\nand greater competition for<br />\nfuture jobs.<br />\nThe basis for \"Night School\"<br />\nat SAIS, namely, the enlargement<br />\nof the student body within the<br />\neight-floor building, is tuition<br />\nrevenue badly needed by the<br />\nschool. On February 7, 1978,<br />\nDean Robert E. Osgood sent a<br />\nmemorandum to all full-time<br />\nfaculty, proposing an \"academic<br />\nstrategy for enlarging full-paid<br />\n<br />\nenrollments, including students<br />\nwho are working full time,<br />\nwithout taxing the library's<br />\nfacilities or creating a new<br />\ndegree. Both the latter issues<br />\nwhere instrumental recently in<br />\nthe defeat of a plan to establish a<br />\nHopkins Evening College<br />\nInternational Studies program in<br />\nthe SAIS building. It was alleged<br />\nby students that an additional<br />\n270 evening students would<br />\nrequire enlarged reserve stack<br />\nlibrary facilities, and that an<br />\neducationally less rigorous B.S.<br />\ndegree would nonetheless cause<br />\nprofessional competition for<br />\nSAIS day students.<br />\nThe new proposal would admit<br />\nthen additional students next fall<br />\nin the following categories: oneyear MIPPs (the regular Master in<br />\nInternational Public Policy<br />\noffered to mid -career<br />\nprofessionals), two-year MIPPs<br />\n(half-time), Special students<br />\n(non-degree students taking one<br />\nor two courses per year), and<br />\nfour-year MA stUdents (thus<br />\nenabling part-time students to be<br />\ndegree candidates.) The latter<br />\nprogram change constitutes a<br />\nmajor innovation.<br />\nThomas Hugo, SAIS Business<br />\nManager, said current SAIS<br />\nenrollment is 282 full-time<br />\nequivalent students.

Associate Professor Ric Pfeffer's<br />\nHopkins career has been terminated by the omnipotent<br />\nAcademic Council. We've been reassured that the process<br />\nwas fairly executed, but we can't help but wonder if some<br />\nhigher misjustice has been perpetrated.<br />\nIt does not matter if one agrees with Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nteachings or not. Supposedly Johns Hopkins is dedicated to<br />\nthe free exchange of ideas in an academic atmosphere, but<br />\nthis seemingly only holds true if those ideas agree with the<br />\nAdministration. No members of either the Administration<br />\nor Academic Council will admit that Dr. Pfeffer's leftist<br />\nleaning was a factor in the decision, but again we can't<br />\nhelp but wonder if Pfeffer's ideas were construed as a threat<br />\nto the University's legendary conservatism.<br />\nMore imperative, however, is the question of how<br />\nimportantly the effectiveness of teaching is weighted in<br />\nsuch a decision. No one can deny Dr. Pfeffer's ability as a<br />\nteacher; in evaluation after evaluation he has received the<br />\nhighest praise from students. This is doubly disturbing. A<br />\nprofessor's teaching ability is apparently never taken into<br />\nconsideration in matters of tenure. Of course the students'<br />\nvoice is never heard in this process. After all, what do the<br />\nstudents know? They only lay down their money and spend<br />\na few years here; they don't/havd perspective. But doesn't<br />\nany university exist for the 136nefit of the students?<br />\nWe do not mean to downgrade the importance of<br />\nscholarship. Hopkins has the reputation it does precisely<br />\nbecause only the best minds in each field can survive here.<br />\nThe stringent ,standards imposed upon the faculty to do<br />\nresearch has made this university an acknowledged inajor<br />\nsource of profound, new ideas. If carried too far, however,<br />\nthis policy can. lead to an academic indifference to<br />\nundergraduates which can only tarnish the university's<br />\nimage.<br />\nWhat is needed is a more balanced approach which would<br />\ntake into account both scholarship and teaching ability.<br />\nSurely, transmitting a new idea to the students is just as<br />\nimportant as mailing it off to the latest scholarly journal.<br />\nRic Pfeffer's dismissal points not so much to political<br />\nintolerance as it does to an academic policy that is seriously<br />\noff balance.<br />\n<br />\nOnce Again?<br />\n<br />\nWithout Uncle Mikey!<br />\n<br />\nstaff writers:Christy Jo Anderson, Ronnie Bialek, Roger<br />\nBlumenthal, Peter Cinquegrani, Gayle Cohen, Paul Cooper, Pat<br />\nErcolano, Mark Fischer, Phil Gilly, Kevin Granville, Adam Gruen,<br />\nCarol Huber, Tim Hutchins, Mitch Hyman, Drougie Johnson, Frank<br />\nJ osba cher, Dan K ingsbury,Mikc Myers, Steve Okada, Paul<br />\nPenniman, Ros Resnick, Larry Rothenburg, Mark Shustcd, Bruce<br />\nVera Strassmann, Chris Stutz,<br />\nSmith, Ned Solomon,<br />\nJack Tyson, Betty Ward,Pepper White, Dan Wile.<br />\nphoto staff: Steffan Burns, Izzy Eisner<br />\nproduction staff: Cliff Braverman, Rita Chang, Kevil Duhon, Bill<br />\nOberle, Elaine Pizzo, Conrad Selnick, Jim Sidbury, Patti Smart,<br />\nMarian Tamburrino<br />\ngraphics:Jim Trone<br />\nad production staff: Stephen Barr, Bruce Lenes<br />\nsubscription manager:Phil Konort<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe take strong exception to<br />\nElana Doering's March 3 article<br />\non the Committee for the<br />\nConversion of the Applied<br />\nPhysics Laboratory.

However, tenure is<br />\nhotly being debated at this<br />\nuniversity and across the<br />\ncountry. Three issues are<br />\nespecially \u2022 contre versial: the<br />\ncriteria for tenure, whether the<br />\ntenure system should exist at all,<br />\nand possible alternatives.<br />\nOnce someone receives tenure,<br />\nhe may remain at the University<br />\nfor the remainder of his career<br />\nunless formally removed by his<br />\npeers. This has never happened<br />\nhere. While most institutions<br />\ngrant tenure to Associate_<br />\nProfessors, Hopkins, throughout<br />\nits history, has been one of the<br />\nfew that tenure only full<br />\nprofessors. According to Dr. G.<br />\nWilson Shaffer, Dean of<br />\nHomewood: Schools from<br />\n1947-67, the greatness of this<br />\nschool depends on the eminence<br />\nof its faculty. Because<br />\ndepartments here are the smallest<br />\nof the top universitites, ne stated,<br />\nany un-productive tenured<br />\nteacher may have a<br />\nProportionally greater negative<br />\nimpact than in a larger<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nIn order for someone to- be<br />\npromoted to Full Professor, the<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences must<br />\nappoint an ad hoc committee of<br />\nthe faculty. In most instances,<br />\nthis will follow a department<br />\nrequest but this in not necessarily<br />\nthe case. A report and<br />\nrecommendation are issued after<br />\nthe committee consults outside<br />\nsources about the candidate's<br />\nsciiolarly and teaching<br />\nreputation. Then the Council<br />\nvotes on the proposal.Though it is<br />\nnot uncommon for the Council<br />\nto override a positive<br />\ndepartmental recommendation,<br />\nthe Dean rarely overrules a<br />\nnegative one.<br />\nAll evaluating bodies base their<br />\nassessments on what Political<br />\nScience Professor, Dr. Francis<br />\nRourke, calls the candidate's<br />\nability to \"advance and<br />\ndisseminate knowledge.\"<br />\nHowever, scholarship is weighted<br />\n<br />\nmore heavily because many<br />\nfaculty members regard it as<br />\neasier to measure than teaching<br />\nand because of Hopkins' long<br />\nreputation as a research<br />\ninstitution. \"A man who is not<br />\nwell know in terms of<br />\nproductivity will neither be able<br />\nto attract graduate students to<br />\ncome here not to help them in<br />\ntheir future careers\", according<br />\nto Dr. Rourke. \"If teachers don't<br />\npublish, then Hopkins will<br />\nperish,\" reminded Dr. Shaffer.<br />\nDr. Harry Sieber, Professor of<br />\nRomance Languages,<br />\ncommented, \"Teaching and<br />\nscholarship go hand in hand.<br />\nIdeally, one should be doing born<br />\nesearch and reaching. These two<br />\nareas feed each other so that<br />\nundergraduates benefit from the<br />\nnewest developments in the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\n\"The junior faculty is under<br />\nno delusion as to what type of<br />\ninstitution Hopkins is,\" said<br />\nAssociate History<br />\nProfessor Dr.<br />\nRichard Kagan. \"I wouldn't<br />\nexpect the University to promote<br />\nme solely on my teaching. I<br />\nwould expect that my promotion<br />\nwould be based on the quality of<br />\nmy research, though teaching is<br />\nimportant.\"<br />\nPressure to publish is thus<br />\nmore understood than overt.<br />\nAssociate Professor of Biology,<br />\nDr. Stephen Roth, remarked,<br />\n\"Most faculty are probably<br />\nheavily pressured, but the<br />\npressure comes meeting the<br />\nstandards of one's own<br />\n.discipline.\"<br />\nThe University tradition of<br />\nconcentrating excellence in a few<br />\nareas of a field and the current<br />\nfinancial crisis both add new<br />\nelements of uncertainty to<br />\npromotions. Since the beginning<br />\nof this decade, tile financial<br />\ncontraction has made tenure<br />\nmore difficult to obtain,<br />\naccording to Professor John<br />\nGryder. Dr. Rourke noted that in<br />\nthe Sixties demand was greater<br />\nand supply small. Unlike today,<br />\nthe University often based<br />\nappointments on the candidate's<br />\npotential for achievement.<br />\n<br />\nprofessor was harder before<br />\nWorld War II because of an<br />\nadditional promotion and<br />\nevaluation step. Today, any<br />\nfreshly hired teacher must be an<br />\nAssistant Professor and an<br />\nAssociate Professore before<br />\ntenure. Before the war, the<br />\npositions of Assistant, Associate,<br />\nand Associate Professor existed.<br />\nEducational circles today are<br />\nalso questioning the very need<br />\nfor tenure. The principal<br />\nanti-tenure argument is that<br />\ntenure has become \"the last<br />\nrefuge of the<br />\nincompetent.\"These opponents<br />\nfeel that faculty regard the<br />\nsystem more as a guarantee of<br />\njob security rather than of<br />\nacademic freedom, its original<br />\npurpose.<br />\nAcademic freedom is still<br />\nimportant, counters Political<br />\nScience Department Chairman,<br />\nDr. Robert W. Tucker. \"During<br />\nthe Cold War, tenure did serve to<br />\nguarantee academic freedom,\" he<br />\nnoted. \"As a result of the Sixties,<br />\nit's become conventional to be<br />\nheretical. Today people are blithe<br />\nabout tne issue of academic<br />\nfreedom. You don't know what<br />\nheresies will arise tomorrow.\" He<br />\nalso said sanctions exist to<br />\ndiscourage incompetence.<br />\nAnother problem, Dr. Gryder<br />\nasserts, is that many young<br />\nfaculty have been tenured in the<br />\npast fifteen years, making<br />\ndeparments \"tenure<br />\nlocked.\"People who share this<br />\nview contend that this prevents<br />\nthe introduction of new men and<br />\nwomen with new ideas. About<br />\n61% of the current Hopkins<br />\nfaculty have tenure.<br />\nThis is by no means a universal<br />\nview. \"The very same goals that<br />\nare sought in keeping too many<br />\npeople from being tenured are<br />\ndestroyed by being too strict,\"<br />\nProfessor Matthew Crenson,<br />\nProfessor of Political Science,<br />\nremarked. \"The non-tenured<br />\npeople want to be as productive<br />\nas possible and to interact with<br />\nsenior faculty.

It is designed to work<br />\nfor and with students while they are at Hopkins (in all schools) and when they<br />\ngraduate. Its aim is to assist the university's Placement Bureau and Student<br />\nEmployment Office in three vital ways:<br />\n1. To bring students in contact with alumni for practical and close-up<br />\ncareer counseling.<br />\n2. To bring students in contact with alumni for rewarding (to both parties)<br />\nfull-time employment during the summer -- and, in the Baltimore area, part-time<br />\njobs during the school year.<br />\n3. To bring students in contact with alumni for career positions following<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nIn all these endeavors, the 45 nationwide chapters of the JHU Alumni<br />\nAssociation and the university's Office of Alumni Relations will play key roles.<br />\nBut the real performers are you, the alumni who are able to help, and the<br />\nstudents who can benefit directly and mightily from your help.<br />\nIn no way is our program meant to pamper our students. We want to help<br />\nthose who want to help themselves. An open letter to them along these same<br />\nlines will appear in the student News-Letter. Those who express a genuine<br />\ninterest will be put in touch with appropriate alumni who have volunteered<br />\ntheir participation. Arrangements will be made throUgh organized channels<br />\nand always at the convenience of alumni.<br />\nWe look upon the Hopkins Employment Liaison Program as being of<br />\nmutual benefit to student and alumnus. It must be, in tact, if it is to happen.<br />\nPerhaps the greatest beneficiary of all, however, is the university itself. For the<br />\nprogram puts emphasis on our most important component, the student, and<br />\nblends past with present while seeking to enrich the future.<br />\nIf HELP holds appeal for you<br />\nor if you know of non-alumni who<br />\nwould be interested, please<br />\nenlist. Just drop a line to the<br />\nundersigned, indicating your<br />\nprofession or the nature of<br />\nyour business and which of<br />\nthe three above categories<br />\napply to you.

I start off down the street at a trot.<br />\nIn toe lobby I find myself in the midst of nearly a<br />\nhundred Japanese, incessantly clicking shutters at the<br />\nticket girl, tile soft drink machine, and the control panel<br />\nof the express elevator. True, they're tourists, but they<br />\njust don't fit toe bill.

When I<br />\nfirst spot some likely prospects, they are gazing intently<br />\nat a miniature EmpireState Building winch lights up,<br />\navparently baffled by its intricate workings. There are<br />\nthree\u2014a man, a woman and a child. He wears ivory-colored<br />\ncowboy boots inlaid with green rninestones, hideous<br />\ngreen *Sears Catalogue trousers, and a white belt. So far, so<br />\ngood. His wife is sporting a pink shift which inadequately covers a<br />\nbeer belly of beachball porportions. This could be it. Tile<br />\ndaugilter is impatiently clomping about in her two\u2014tone<br />\nBuster Brown Easter snoes. I'm almost positive. Only one<br />\nmore test remains. I move in closer and cock my ear their<br />\nway.<br />\nThe father looks about the Observatory, screws up his<br />\nface in disgust, and says to his wife, \"Ma, I don't know<br />\nabout this town.

No<br />\nfear; no vertigo. The crisis is over. I can face anything<br />\nnow.<br />\n<br />\nThe NeW York Student Center gets its funding from<br />\nthe U.N., its office space from the Empire Hotel, and a<br />\ngood dcal of its unique charm from a certain Hopkins ,<br />\nstudent.

Today,<br />\nhowever, he's consented to knock off early and assume the<br />\nrole of my Trusty Native Guide for a tour of toe city's<br />\nseamier side.<br />\nWhen I arrive at the office, he is seated behind the<br />\ncheck-in desk, engaged in a heated conversation with an<br />\nirate young Frenchman. He motions for me to nave a seat<br />\nand await the outcome.When the Parisian finally leaves in<br />\na huff, I inquire as to just what the problem was.<br />\nThe French are the worst,\" says he. \"They've got<br />\nbeing a pain in the ass down to a science. First of all,.his<br />\nroom was too small, so I moved him.

I told nim to take the subway<br />\nuptown and get off at 145th Street.\" The smile widens.<br />\n\"We won't be getting any more lip from nim.\" Reaching<br />\ndown to pull the cork from a Taylor State, he lets<br />\nout a contented sigh.<br />\n\"I really appreciate you showing me around.\"<br />\n\"Don't mention it,\" he chuckles with a dismissing wave<br />\nof his nand. \"I've just had to assign two guys from tile<br />\nUniversity of Johannesburg to a room with a couple of<br />\nNigerian exchange students, and I'd just as soon leave<br />\nbefore the shit hits the fan.\"<br />\nJust then, a lanky Italian bursts into the room and<br />\nbegins babbling excitedly to one of the other employees.<br />\nHe holds a bloody nandkerchief over a deep gash in nis<br />\nleg.<br />\n\"What's ii is problem?\" I ask.<br />\n\"I don't know much Italian,\" he says. \"Something<br />\nabout snowplows.

Darkness has fallen, and strobe lights flash from<br />\nthe grimy windows of snops offering paraphernalia of<br />\nevery kind.<br />\n\"Is this an authentic Greenwich Village head shoo?\"<br />\n\"Yeah, real authentic,\" says my Guide sarcastically,<br />\npointing an accusing finger at the Mastercharge sticker on<br />\nthe door. \"And don't bother lookin' for any others\u2014tney<br />\nall take Mastercharge. Existentialism is big business these<br />\ndays. Authenticity my ass.\" We continue along the<br />\nnarrow streets, and my senses are pleasantly accosted by<br />\nsights and sounds. Exotic smells drift streetward from<br />\ndimly-lit restaurants, soft guitar chords waft down from<br />\na fire escape. Everywhere, people are lounging about--on<br />\nthe hoods of cars, on the stoops of nooses. The street is<br />\ntransfomied into an extneded porch, and much of the<br />\ncity's former indifference seems to have melted away.<br />\nWow,\" I innocently exclaim,\"I feel as though I'm in a<br />\nDylan song.\" My Trusty Native Guide throws me a severe<br />\nsideways glance and cautions me that further starry-eyed<br />\noutbursts will not be well received. I have chosen well--he<br />\nis a veteran of blackouts, muggings, and transit strikes,<br />\nand will put up with no malarky.<br />\nTurning a corner, we spy a sandwich board winch<br />\nreads: PITCHERS OF HEINIKEN $3.00. Recovering<br />\nfrom our initial shock, we dash inside and proceed to<br />\nthrow down the cold gold as if the Russians were in<br />\nQueens. After all, how often is it that college students can<br />\nafford the truly aristocratic drunk that only mass<br />\nquantities of Heiniken can provide? Feeling my curiousity<br />\namply lubricated, I begin to press my Trusty Native Guide<br />\nfor information.<br />\n\"Is it just my imagination, or do most of the men in<br />\nthis city look like faggots?\"<br />\n\"A little of both, really.\"<br />\n\"How come the girls here look so much better?\"<br />\n\"Cause this is New York for Christsake! Why don't you<br />\nask something intelligent?\"<br />\n\"You want another pitcher?\"<br />\nApproximately thirty minutes later two thoroughly<br />\njousted Hoppies emerge from the bar and begin to make<br />\ntheir stumbling way toward Bowery Street. My Trusty<br />\nNative Guide has promised to take roe<br />\ntoCBGB's--Manhattan's most infamous punk bar and the<br />\nundisputed rotton core of the Big Apple.<br />\nWe damn near didn't make it.<br />\nIt all all happened so fast, and my brain was so<br />\nincapacitated, that all I remember are fleeting, isolated<br />\nflashes. There is a squealing of tires, a small explosion,<br />\nand then a car careens around the corner, knocking a<br />\nphone booth to the ground. I remember seeing the<br />\ndriver's features; ne is dark-skinned and has a look of<br />\n<br />\nabsolute terror frozen to his face; nis knuckles are white<br />\nwhere they desperately clutch the wheel, tile hanging dice<br />\nhopelessly entwined about the rear-view mirror. In hot<br />\npursuit is a '57 Chevy with a menacing snowplow welded<br />\nto the front end. As the speeding juggernaut flashes past, I<br />\nsee the R.I.T.E. logo stenciled on the side. Just as quickly<br />\nas the ruckus began, both cars are gone and once again the<br />\nstreet is silent. \"Damn foreign beer,\" curses my Guide,<br />\nbrushing imself off. \"Next time I'll stick with<br />\nBud.\"<br />\n<br />\nCBGB's appears down the block, and my Guide<br />\noffers word of warning. \"This place,\" he says, \"is a real<br />\ntoilet. But you wanted something authentic.\" After a<br />\nfour-dollar cover charge at tile door and a two-drink<br />\nminimum at the table, I'm convinced it's the most<br />\nexpensive toilet I've ever stuck my tread into, authentic or<br />\notherwise. And if the building itself is a toilet, then the<br />\nclientele is a real open sewer. There are folks sporting dog<br />\ncollars, safety pins, Nazi regalia, and several people \u2022<br />\nof indeterminate gender. In my collegiate garb, I feel<br />\nsomewhat like a moonie at a Hell's Angels picnic.<br />\nA chap at the next table is trying to start a fire in his<br />\nbeer glass, and my Trusty Guide and I are made to<br />\nunderstand that we are to contribute some paper to the<br />\nconflagration or be immediately castrated. Luckily, ne is<br />\nsatisfied with my Social Security card and a picture of<br />\nMom, allowing me to save my last twenty dollar bill from<br />\nconsignment to the flames.<br />\nThe first punkers to arrive onstage are deafening, but<br />\notherwise rather ordinary. The lyrics are unintelligible,<br />\nbut to judge from the riveted attention of the kinky<br />\naficionados down front, the nlace must be full of<br />\nlipreaders. The ever resourceful \"talent\" fills up the long<br />\ninterval between chord ciianges by alternately spitting at<br />\nthe audience and taking long swigs of beer (which are also<br />\noccasionally spewed at the less enthusiastic among the<br />\nfans). Now I ask you\u2014where else can you get such<br />\nentertainment for the reasonable price of only half a<br />\nmint?<br />\n\"D'you come yere often?\" I ask my Guide.<br />\n\"Naw, only after proms.\" Fat and sassy indeed.<br />\nTile second band announces its presence by flinging a<br />\ndead animal into the screaming crowd. During the course<br />\nof the show it will gradually be returned to the stage--a<br />\nlimb at a time. That's what I like to see--audience<br />\nparticipation.<br />\n\"Hey,\" says my Trusty Native Guide. \"You wanna<br />\nhave some fun?\" Fully aware that we are both in a<br />\nquestionable condition, I am overly suspicious.<br />\n'What kinda fun?'<br />\n\"I'm gonna go up there and request some Barry<br />\nManilow. You cover me.\"<br />\nIt's a great place to visit, but I really wouldn't want<br />\nto live there. Hmmm--I've got this strong suspicion that<br />\nNew Yorkers feel much the same way about tile rest of<br />\n. the country. No excuses, though, I'm nooked. I never<br />\ncould see enough, but the cherry blossoms will be busting<br />\nin the Lower Quad, and I've got to get back. However,<br />\nthis is one country boy who's seen the ligut.

That<br />\nBaltimore, where Poe lived for a couple of years, died and<br />\nis buried, should be a Mecca for Poe people is quite<br />\nnatural, but this spring the faithful would be better off<br />\nstaying at home.<br />\nFirst of all, the 125-year-old Westminster Presbyterian<br />\nChurch, in whose graveyard Poe,us wife Virginia and aunt<br />\nMarie Clemm Poe are buried, held its last service this past<br />\nDecember. The graveyard itself, though, is still open to<br />\nthe public. Secondly, Poe's house on Amity Street, his<br />\nBaltimore residence from 1832-5, closed not long<br />\nthereafter for extensive repairs. In a recent newspaper<br />\narticle concerning actor Vincent Price's visit to the house,<br />\nit was disclosed that owing to red tape the renovations<br />\nneeded. to prevent its falling like Usher have not yet<br />\nbegun.<br />\nBack to the den. No shortage of reading material there.<br />\nPoe has been the subject of hundreds of biographies and<br />\ncrifical studies and additional books continue to appear.<br />\nA recenlly published biography of Poe by an English<br />\njournalist, David Sinclair, will soon be followed by<br />\nBarbara and Dwight Steward's novel Evermore, in which<br />\nPoe, who died in 1849, somehow appears in 1889 to solve<br />\na murder mystery. Then in April comes the most<br />\nimpressive and expensive new Poe book, a two-volume,<br />\ncomplete Tales and Sketches, edited by the late Poe<br />\nscholar Thomas Mabbott and priced at $45.<br />\n<br />\nPoe and his thoughts<br />\nThe Edgar Allan Poe Scrapbook, .a profusely the University of Virginia and West Point wrote<br />\nillustrated, large-format paperback, is a collection of reminiscences of him, the latter an amusing tale of when<br />\narticles, cartoons, photographs, poems, memoirs, stories, Poe took part in \"the eating of a Professor in effigy.\"<br />\nMoving forward in time a bit, tributes to Poe from<br />\nadvertisements and letters.

He might also feel that half-hearted efforts<br />\nare permissable in a town like Baltimore, which after all is<br />\njust the place one passes on the train from Washington to<br />\nNew York. For either or both of these reasons, the Eric<br />\nClapton concert -last Friday night at the Civic Center<br />\nwas merely so-so.<br />\nSupposedly, Baltimore has toe reputation of being a<br />\nbad place in which to play. Clapton surely should not<br />\nhave voiced that complaint. Last Friday's crowd, consisting<br />\nof the usual blotto teenagers,packed the<br />\nCivic Center<br />\nand yelled their heads off when the lights dimmed prior<br />\nto Clapton's entrance.<br />\nThanks to the opening act, the show started on a<br />\ndismal note. A drunk Scotsman by the name of John<br />\n.1 Sixties folkie)<br />\nMartyn (barely memorable as<br />\nambled onstage and made an offensive noise for forty-five<br />\ntorturous minutes. Rarely picking the acoustic guitar that<br />\nhe slung around on his lap, Martyn, looking like Mick<br />\nJagger confined to a wheelchair, hit various devices with<br />\nhis feet, producing bizarre feedback sounds that made a<br />\nlistener wish for an aspirin or a gun. The crowd lost<br />\ninterest fast and found solace in playing with the green<br />\nfluorescent batons that were being sold all evening.<br />\nAfter the capacity crowd enjoyed a much-deserved<br />\nintermission, the house darkened and Clapton and his<br />\nband struck up \"The Core,\" from his latest album,<br />\nSlowhand. The lackadaisical rendition of this dynamic<br />\nsong keynoted the rest of the program. The band seemed<br />\nto be playing at a slow, sometimes lethargic pace. When<br />\nthe instrumental break and Clapton's first solo of the<br />\nnight came up, the audience reverently leaned forward to<br />\nlisten to tile master. What they heard was somewhat<br />\ndisappointing. Clapton was holding back; the solo was<br />\n<br />\n41 lint IIjtui<br />\n<br />\npunchless.

The left-handed<br />\nSyrnick, who had trimmed<br />\nKeleher 54 in a dual meet during<br />\nthe season, was unable to answer<br />\nfive straight touches from the<br />\nHopkins ace, leaving the final<br />\nscore 5-0.<br />\nAnother good bout for<br />\nKeleher was against current<br />\nnational champion Sheilah<br />\nArmstrong, from Jersey City<br />\nState College. Armstrong, one of<br />\nthe top four fencers on the U.S.<br />\nOlympic team, gave up four<br />\ntouches before squeaking to a<br />\none-point victory over the<br />\nHopkins pre-law student.<br />\nFreshman Wendy Galfand,<br />\nwho holds down the second (B)<br />\nposition on the squad, came back<br />\nto wrap up ten points after an<br />\neight-bout losing streak in the<br />\nearly part of the match.

In the next few<br />\nsuccessive weeks the Jays will<br />\nplay Virginia, Cornell, Ar.my,<br />\nMaryland, and Navy. Princeton<br />\nprovided a fine warm up for the<br />\nBlue Jays, but Virginia will be<br />\nthe first real test for Mr.<br />\nCiccarone's team.<br />\nThe varsity laxers showed off<br />\ntheir frosh talent in the opener<br />\nagainst Yale, on March 18. Two<br />\nfreshmen, Rich Wilkens and Ned<br />\nRadebaugh, accounted for six<br />\npoints between them. The game's<br />\nreal star, however, turned out to<br />\nbe veteran midfielder Scott<br />\nBaugher who hit the net four<br />\ntimes and helped others to do so<br />\ntwice.<br />\nBlue Jay scorers went to town<br />\nin their ,next game with<br />\nWashington College. Bob<br />\nDeSimone and Dave Huntley<br />\ncontributed four goals apiece to a<br />\n21-31 triumph. In their second<br />\n_game with an Ivy League<br />\nOpponent, the Hopkins stickmen,<br />\nled by fine goaltending from<br />\nMike Federico, beat Harvard by<br />\nthe count of 12-7.<br />\nUnlike last season, the Towson<br />\nState Tigers proved to be no<br />\ncompetition for the Jays when<br />\nthey faced them on Homewood<br />\nField in late March. Dave<br />\nHuntley was the leading scorer in<br />\nthis 22-5 victory with only three<br />\ngoals. Coach Ciccarone was<br />\nPleased with the team's balanced<br />\nscoring attack in this effort.<br />\nWith four wins under their<br />\nbelt, the laxers faced their first<br />\nreal test of the 1978 season and<br />\nfaired well, putting another one<br />\nin the win column by beating<br />\n<br />\nPrinceton 14 to 7.<br />\nCoached by former Hopkins<br />\nstar Don Zimmerman, Princeton<br />\nfielded a fine team that Mr.<br />\nCiccarone felt was \"the second<br />\nbest team in the Ivy League.\"<br />\nZimmerman graduated from<br />\nJohns Hopkins in 1976 as an<br />\nAll-American midfielder. Last<br />\nseason \"Zim\" coached the<br />\nHopkins B-team and scouted for<br />\nthe varsity, but this year will be<br />\nspent as an assistant at Princeton.<br />\nDespite Zimmerman's efforts<br />\nto prepare his team, the Blue<br />\nJa)rs' awesome offense overcame<br />\nthe Princeton defense 14 times.<br />\nHopkins team captain, Mike<br />\nO'Neill, accounted for four net<br />\nrippers and Jim Bidne hit twice.<br />\nAnother reason for the Jays'<br />\nsuccess is their ground ball<br />\nability, and Bob DeSimone led in<br />\nthat department, getting nine.<br />\nPrinceton was an excellent<br />\nwarm-up for the Jays' mid-season<br />\npush for two reason.

The fourth (D) spot<br />\nwas shared by sophomore Kate<br />\nSullivan and senior Valerie Fein,<br />\nwho scored two and seven points<br />\nrespectively, with Fein fencing<br />\nthe majority of the bouts. The<br />\nfinal team score was 43.<br />\n\"We're happy being eighteenth<br />\nagain,\" stated Green, \"because<br />\nthe team really isn't as strong as<br />\nit was last year, and yet it did<br />\njust as well.<br />\n\"The future is very bright, too.<br />\nWe have two freshmen, Carol<br />\nPertowski and Inge Krumpholtz,<br />\nwho will definitely be fencing<br />\nwith the varsity team next year,<br />\nso we ought to have a strong<br />\nteam for years to come.\" The<br />\nwhole team seems enthusiastic<br />\nabout next year.

Professor Aihud Pevsner<br />\nsaid: \"The goal of the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee was to request letters<br />\nof recommendation from leading<br />\nscholars around the country, to<br />\nevaluate these letters, and to<br />\nmake its recommendation to the<br />\nAcademic Council. We took very<br />\nseriously what the ad hoc<br />\ncommittee said, and I believed<br />\nthe decision was arrived at<br />\nfairly.\"<br />\nNeither the ad hoc committee<br />\nnor the Academic Council could<br />\ndetermine unanimously what<br />\npart of Dr. Pfeffer's work ought<br />\nto be most important in<br />\nevaluating his request for tenure.<br />\nFrom his arrival at Johns<br />\nHopkins in 1969 until 1973,<br />\nProfessor Pfeffer specialized in<br />\nChinese socialism; in 1973 he<br />\nwent on sabbatical to work in a<br />\nfactory, and since then he has<br />\nspent more time examining<br />\nAmerican capitalism.<br />\nAs a result, the focus of his<br />\nwritings shifted during his years<br />\nat Hopkins. These writings<br />\ninclude articles on China studies<br />\nthroughout his nine years here,<br />\nand a manuscript tentatively<br />\nentitled Working For Capiralistn,<br />\nscheduled to be published by<br />\n,Columbia University Press.<br />\nAlmost all of the letters the<br />\ncommittee received on Dr.<br />\nPfeffer's work on China studies<br /><br />\nwere favorable, but those letters<br />\ndealing with his book were fewer<br />\nand more critical. An added<br />\nfactor in this case, and one which<br />\nsome students emphasized, is<br />\nthat Dr. Pfeffer is an outstanding<br />\nteacher.<br />\nFaced with these<br />\nconsiderations, the majority of<br />\ncommittee and Council members<br />\nconcluded that Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nearlier articles on China studies<br />\nwere irrelevant, that his later<br />\nmanuscript was not an exemplary<br />\npiece of scholarship, and that nis<br />\nteaching excellence could not be<br />\n,judged accurately and thus was<br />\nof minor importance.<br />\nWhen informed of the<br />\nCommittee's findings, Dr. Pfeffer<br />\nwas upset that his earlier work<br />\nhad been disregarded and that us<br />\nteaching skills had played no real<br />\npart in the proceedings.' In<br />\nexplaining the shift in his studies<br />\nseveral years ago from China to<br />\nAmerica, he said that in order to<br />\nunderstand Chinese socialism and<br />\nMarxism more fully, he felt it<br />\nwas necessary to devote several<br />\nyears to the study of American<br />\ncapitalism. He also pointed out<br />\nthat his work on China had by no<br />\nmeans stopped since 1972. \"In<br />\nOctober, 1976, I wrote a forty<br />\npage article on Mao which<br />\ntouched off a major debate<br />\namong scholars around the<br />\ncountry. I also published in 1977<br />\na rebuttal to arguments which<br />\nhad been raised against the 1976<br />\narticle,\" he said.<br />\nThe reaction of the students to<br />\nthe decision has thus far been<br />\nquiet resignation.<br /><br />\nPfeffer Statement<br />\nS tatement by Ric Pfeffer, April 6, 1978, relating to my being denied<br />\ntenure<br />\nI recognize that after a long struggle, I have finally been accorded<br />\nprocedural justice.<br />\nThat most people involved in the decision have worked hard and<br />\ntried to be fair, I have no doubt. But since the traditional promotion<br />\nprocedures at Hopkins are so secretive, I have no basis for<br />\ndetermingwhether I have been accorded substantive justice.<br />\nI do not, for example, know what my referees said concerning the<br />\ntwo areas of scholarship (Chinese socialism and American capitalism)<br />\nin which I am working, or to what extent teaching truly was given<br />\nweight in the final decision.<br />\nJ therefore call for the record of the roceedin s to be made<br />\nublic.<br /><br />\n46<br />\nIDE THIS ISSUE<br />\nTenure,Tenure,Who's Got the Tenure?

But the concept<br />\nof a \"Night School\" lives on, in<br />\nthe form of a new proposal to<br />\nallow more part-time and<br />\nnon-degree students.<br />\n\"Night School\" is a symbolic<br />\nterm at SAIS. For the<br />\nadministration, it means utilizing<br />\nthe school classroom facilities<br />\nwhen they are currently<br />\nunderused by the existing<br />\nprograms. For the administrative<br />\nstaff, \"Night School\" has implied<br />\nan increased workload where the<br />\npresent facilities are already<br />\ncramped. For sonic of the<br />\nfaculty, it means the opportunity<br />\nto teach additional sections of<br />\noverenrolled courses with the<br />\nconcomitant increased pay. And<br />\nfor students \"Night School\"<br />\nconjures up images of larger<br />\nclasses, less space in the library<br />\nand greater competition for<br />\nfuture jobs.<br />\nThe basis for \"Night School\"<br />\nat SAIS, namely, the enlargement<br />\nof the student body within the<br />\neight-floor building, is tuition<br />\nrevenue badly needed by the<br />\nschool. On February 7, 1978,<br />\nDean Robert E. Osgood sent a<br />\nmemorandum to all full-time<br />\nfaculty, proposing an \"academic<br />\nstrategy for enlarging full-paid<br /><br />\nenrollments, including students<br />\nwho are working full time,<br />\nwithout taxing the library's<br />\nfacilities or creating a new<br />\ndegree. Both the latter issues<br />\nwhere instrumental recently in<br />\nthe defeat of a plan to establish a<br />\nHopkins Evening College<br />\nInternational Studies program in<br />\nthe SAIS building. It was alleged<br />\nby students that an additional<br />\n270 evening students would<br />\nrequire enlarged reserve stack<br />\nlibrary facilities, and that an<br />\neducationally less rigorous B.S.<br />\ndegree would nonetheless cause<br />\nprofessional competition for<br />\nSAIS day students.<br />\nThe new proposal would admit<br />\nthen additional students next fall<br />\nin the following categories: oneyear MIPPs (the regular Master in<br />\nInternational Public Policy<br />\noffered to mid -career<br />\nprofessionals), two-year MIPPs<br />\n(half-time), Special students<br />\n(non-degree students taking one<br />\nor two courses per year), and<br />\nfour-year MA stUdents (thus<br />\nenabling part-time students to be<br />\ndegree candidates.) The latter<br />\nprogram change constitutes a<br />\nmajor innovation.<br />\nThomas Hugo, SAIS Business<br />\nManager, said current SAIS<br />\nenrollment is 282 full-time<br />\nequivalent students.

Associate Professor Ric Pfeffer's<br />\nHopkins career has been terminated by the omnipotent<br />\nAcademic Council. We've been reassured that the process<br />\nwas fairly executed, but we can't help but wonder if some<br />\nhigher misjustice has been perpetrated.<br />\nIt does not matter if one agrees with Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nteachings or not. Supposedly Johns Hopkins is dedicated to<br />\nthe free exchange of ideas in an academic atmosphere, but<br />\nthis seemingly only holds true if those ideas agree with the<br />\nAdministration. No members of either the Administration<br />\nor Academic Council will admit that Dr. Pfeffer's leftist<br />\nleaning was a factor in the decision, but again we can't<br />\nhelp but wonder if Pfeffer's ideas were construed as a threat<br />\nto the University's legendary conservatism.<br />\nMore imperative, however, is the question of how<br />\nimportantly the effectiveness of teaching is weighted in<br />\nsuch a decision. No one can deny Dr. Pfeffer's ability as a<br />\nteacher; in evaluation after evaluation he has received the<br />\nhighest praise from students. This is doubly disturbing. A<br />\nprofessor's teaching ability is apparently never taken into<br />\nconsideration in matters of tenure. Of course the students'<br />\nvoice is never heard in this process. After all, what do the<br />\nstudents know? They only lay down their money and spend<br />\na few years here; they don't/havd perspective.

However, tenure is<br />\nhotly being debated at this<br />\nuniversity and across the<br />\ncountry. Three issues are<br />\nespecially \u2022 contre versial: the<br />\ncriteria for tenure, whether the<br />\ntenure system should exist at all,<br />\nand possible alternatives.<br />\nOnce someone receives tenure,<br />\nhe may remain at the University<br />\nfor the remainder of his career<br />\nunless formally removed by his<br />\npeers. This has never happened<br />\nhere. While most institutions<br />\ngrant tenure to Associate_<br />\nProfessors, Hopkins, throughout<br />\nits history, has been one of the<br />\nfew that tenure only full<br />\nprofessors. According to Dr. G.<br />\nWilson Shaffer, Dean of<br />\nHomewood: Schools from<br />\n1947-67, the greatness of this<br />\nschool depends on the eminence<br />\nof its faculty. Because<br />\ndepartments here are the smallest<br />\nof the top universitites, ne stated,<br />\nany un-productive tenured<br />\nteacher may have a<br />\nProportionally greater negative<br />\nimpact than in a larger<br />\ninstitution.<br />\nIn order for someone to- be<br />\npromoted to Full Professor, the<br />\nDean of Arts and Sciences must<br />\nappoint an ad hoc committee of<br />\nthe faculty. In most instances,<br />\nthis will follow a department<br />\nrequest but this in not necessarily<br />\nthe case. A report and<br />\nrecommendation are issued after<br />\nthe committee consults outside<br />\nsources about the candidate's<br />\nsciiolarly and teaching<br />\nreputation. Then the Council<br />\nvotes on the proposal.Though it is<br />\nnot uncommon for the Council<br />\nto override a positive<br />\ndepartmental recommendation,<br />\nthe Dean rarely overrules a<br />\nnegative one.<br />\nAll evaluating bodies base their<br />\nassessments on what Political<br />\nScience Professor, Dr. Francis<br />\nRourke, calls the candidate's<br />\nability to \"advance and<br />\ndisseminate knowledge.\"<br />\nHowever, scholarship is weighted<br /><br />\nmore heavily because many<br />\nfaculty members regard it as<br />\neasier to measure than teaching<br />\nand because of Hopkins' long<br />\nreputation as a research<br />\ninstitution. \"A man who is not<br />\nwell know in terms of<br />\nproductivity will neither be able<br />\nto attract graduate students to<br />\ncome here not to help them in<br />\ntheir future careers\", according<br />\nto Dr. Rourke. \"If teachers don't<br />\npublish, then Hopkins will<br />\nperish,\" reminded Dr. Shaffer.<br />\nDr. Harry Sieber, Professor of<br />\nRomance Languages,<br />\ncommented, \"Teaching and<br />\nscholarship go hand in hand.<br />\nIdeally, one should be doing born<br />\nesearch and reaching. These two<br />\nareas feed each other so that<br />\nundergraduates benefit from the<br />\nnewest developments in the<br />\nfield.\"<br />\n\"The junior faculty is under<br />\nno delusion as to what type of<br />\ninstitution Hopkins is,\" said<br />\nAssociate History<br />\nProfessor Dr.<br />\nRichard Kagan. \"I wouldn't<br />\nexpect the University to promote<br />\nme solely on my teaching. I<br />\nwould expect that my promotion<br />\nwould be based on the quality of<br />\nmy research, though teaching is<br />\nimportant.\"<br />\nPressure to publish is thus<br />\nmore understood than overt.<br />\nAssociate Professor of Biology,<br />\nDr. Stephen Roth, remarked,<br />\n\"Most faculty are probably<br />\nheavily pressured, but the<br />\npressure comes meeting the<br />\nstandards of one's own<br />\n.discipline.\"<br />\nThe University tradition of<br />\nconcentrating excellence in a few<br />\nareas of a field and the current<br />\nfinancial crisis both add new<br />\nelements of uncertainty to<br />\npromotions. Since the beginning<br />\nof this decade, tile financial<br />\ncontraction has made tenure<br />\nmore difficult to obtain,<br />\naccording to Professor John<br />\nGryder. Dr. Rourke noted that in<br />\nthe Sixties demand was greater<br />\nand supply small. Unlike today,<br />\nthe University often based<br />\nappointments on the candidate's<br />\npotential for achievement.<br /><br />\nprofessor was harder before<br />\nWorld War II because of an<br />\nadditional promotion and<br />\nevaluation step. Today, any<br />\nfreshly hired teacher must be an<br />\nAssistant Professor and an<br />\nAssociate Professore before<br />\ntenure. Before the war, the<br />\npositions of Assistant, Associate,<br />\nand Associate Professor existed.<br />\nEducational circles today are<br />\nalso questioning the very need<br />\nfor tenure. The principal<br />\nanti-tenure argument is that<br />\ntenure has become \"the last<br />\nrefuge of the<br />\nincompetent.\"These opponents<br />\nfeel that faculty regard the<br />\nsystem more as a guarantee of<br />\njob security rather than of<br />\nacademic freedom, its original<br />\npurpose.<br />\nAcademic freedom is still<br />\nimportant, counters Political<br />\nScience Department Chairman,<br />\nDr. Robert W. Tucker. \"During<br />\nthe Cold War, tenure did serve to<br />\nguarantee academic freedom,\" he<br />\nnoted. \"As a result of the Sixties,<br />\nit's become conventional to be<br />\nheretical. Today people are blithe<br />\nabout tne issue of academic<br />\nfreedom. You don't know what<br />\nheresies will arise tomorrow.\" He<br />\nalso said sanctions exist to<br />\ndiscourage incompetence.<br />\nAnother problem, Dr. Gryder<br />\nasserts, is that many young<br />\nfaculty have been tenured in the<br />\npast fifteen years, making<br />\ndeparments \"tenure<br />\nlocked.\"People who share this<br />\nview contend that this prevents<br />\nthe introduction of new men and<br />\nwomen with new ideas. About<br />\n61% of the current Hopkins<br />\nfaculty have tenure.<br />\nThis is by no means a universal<br />\nview. \"The very same goals that<br />\nare sought in keeping too many<br />\npeople from being tenured are<br />\ndestroyed by being too strict,\"<br />\nProfessor Matthew Crenson,<br />\nProfessor of Political Science,<br />\nremarked. \"The non-tenured<br />\npeople want to be as productive<br />\nas possible and to interact with<br />\nsenior faculty.

It is designed to work<br />\nfor and with students while they are at Hopkins (in all schools) and when they<br />\ngraduate. Its aim is to assist the university's Placement Bureau and Student<br />\nEmployment Office in three vital ways:<br />\n1. To bring students in contact with alumni for practical and close-up<br />\ncareer counseling.<br />\n2. To bring students in contact with alumni for rewarding (to both parties)<br />\nfull-time employment during the summer -- and, in the Baltimore area, part-time<br />\njobs during the school year.<br />\n3. To bring students in contact with alumni for career positions following<br />\ngraduation.<br />\nIn all these endeavors, the 45 nationwide chapters of the JHU Alumni<br />\nAssociation and the university's Office of Alumni Relations will play key roles.<br />\nBut the real performers are you, the alumni who are able to help, and the<br />\nstudents who can benefit directly and mightily from your help.<br />\nIn no way is our program meant to pamper our students. We want to help<br />\nthose who want to help themselves. An open letter to them along these same<br />\nlines will appear in the student News-Letter. Those who express a genuine<br />\ninterest will be put in touch with appropriate alumni who have volunteered<br />\ntheir participation. Arrangements will be made throUgh organized channels<br />\nand always at the convenience of alumni.<br />\nWe look upon the Hopkins Employment Liaison Program as being of<br />\nmutual benefit to student and alumnus. It must be, in tact, if it is to happen.<br />\nPerhaps the greatest beneficiary of all, however, is the university itself. For the<br />\nprogram puts emphasis on our most important component, the student, and<br />\nblends past with present while seeking to enrich the future.<br />\nIf HELP holds appeal for you<br />\nor if you know of non-alumni who<br />\nwould be interested, please<br />\nenlist. Just drop a line to the<br />\nundersigned, indicating your<br />\nprofession or the nature of<br />\nyour business and which of<br />\nthe three above categories<br />\napply to you.

Suddenly, towering over me, the answer to my<br />\nprayers appears. Of course! Tile Empire State Building!<br />\nWhat better magnet for tile provincial legions could there<br />\nbe? I start off down the street at a trot.<br />\nIn toe lobby I find myself in the midst of nearly a<br />\nhundred Japanese, incessantly clicking shutters at the<br />\nticket girl, tile soft drink machine, and the control panel<br />\nof the express elevator. True, they're tourists, but they<br />\njust don't fit toe bill. Glodhoppers alone will put my mind<br />\nat ease.<br />\nWhen the door opens at the observatory, tile Japanese,<br />\nnow out of film, rush as one body to the souvenir shop,<br />\nnearly trampling me in their wake. Frantically I scour tile<br />\nroom .with my eyes, searching for kith and kin. When I<br />\nfirst spot some likely prospects, they are gazing intently<br />\nat a miniature EmpireState Building winch lights up,<br />\navparently baffled by its intricate workings. There are<br />\nthree\u2014a man, a woman and a child. He wears ivory-colored<br />\ncowboy boots inlaid with green rninestones, hideous<br />\ngreen *Sears Catalogue trousers, and a white belt. So far, so<br />\ngood. His wife is sporting a pink shift which inadequately covers a<br />\nbeer belly of beachball porportions. This could be it. Tile<br />\ndaugilter is impatiently clomping about in her two\u2014tone<br />\nBuster Brown Easter snoes. I'm almost positive. Only one<br />\nmore test remains. I move in closer and cock my ear their<br />\nway.<br />\nThe father looks about the Observatory, screws up his<br />\nface in disgust, and says to his wife, \"Ma, I don't know<br />\nabout this town. Have you ever seen this many Jews in all<br />\nYour life?\"<br />\nPavdirt!!!<br />\nIt's amazing--just the kind of retarded rube I came east<br />\nto escape--but now, for a while at least, I need him and nis<br />\nhayseed family. t introduce myself and we talk of tile<br />\ngreat sprawling boondocks we've left behind; of spring<br />\nrunoff and the farmer's strike. A quarter of an 'lour later<br />\nI in completely recovered. This sequined sodbuster nas<br />\nacted like a Human valium ou me, and now I can carry on.<br />\nWalking out onto the observation deck, I see the wiiole<br />\nlength and breadth of the city spread out before me. No<br />\nfear; no vertigo. The crisis is over. I can face anything<br />\nnow.<br /><br />\nThe NeW York Student Center gets its funding from<br />\nthe U.N., its office space from the Empire Hotel, and a<br />\ngood dcal of its unique charm from a certain Hopkins ,<br />\nstudent. Last year rue too wus a member-in-good-standing<br />\nof true Lonely Hearts Brigade, but since 'las grown fat and<br />\nsassy under the tutelage of a good woman. So vital is this<br />\nmulti-lingual wizard to the running of the Center's<br />\nday-to-day machinations, that he 'las been pressed into<br />\nservice over Spring vacation, lured by a modest boost in<br />\nPay and a constant flow of domestic red wine. Today,<br />\nhowever, he's consented to knock off early and assume the<br />\nrole of my Trusty Native Guide for a tour of toe city's<br />\nseamier side.<br />\nWhen I arrive at the office, he is seated behind the<br />\ncheck-in desk, engaged in a heated conversation with an<br />\nirate young Frenchman. He motions for me to nave a seat<br />\nand await the outcome.When the Parisian finally leaves in<br />\na huff, I inquire as to just what the problem was.<br />\nThe French are the worst,\" says he. \"They've got<br />\nbeing a pain in the ass down to a science. First of all,.his<br />\nroom was too small, so I moved him. Then his roommate<br />\n\u2022 OPP\"'<br /><br />\n!didn't suit his highness, so I moved him again.\" He points<br />\nI to a sizable stack of paperwork on tne desk. \"As if I<br />\ndidn't have enough crap without his whining. Now it<br />\nseems someone scuffed up nis luggage. Breaks my neart.\"<br />\nNow, nowever, a smile comes to his face as he says, \"We<br />\nhave a cure for guys like that, though.\"<br />\n\"How so?\"<br />\n\"Last thing he did was to ask for directions for the<br />\nMetropolitan Museum. I told nim to take the subway<br />\nuptown and get off at 145th Street.\" The smile widens.<br />\n\"We won't be getting any more lip from nim.\" Reaching<br />\ndown to pull the cork from a Taylor State, he lets<br />\nout a contented sigh.<br />\n\"I really appreciate you showing me around.\"<br />\n\"Don't mention it,\" he chuckles with a dismissing wave<br />\nof his nand. \"I've just had to assign two guys from tile<br />\nUniversity of Johannesburg to a room with a couple of<br />\nNigerian exchange students, and I'd just as soon leave<br />\nbefore the shit hits the fan.\"<br />\nJust then, a lanky Italian bursts into the room and<br />\nbegins babbling excitedly to one of the other employees.<br />\nHe holds a bloody nandkerchief over a deep gash in nis<br />\nleg.<br />\n\"What's ii is problem?\" I ask.<br />\n\"I don't know much Italian,\" he says. \"Something<br />\nabout snowplows. Must be nigh or somethin'.\"<br />\nWe polish off the last of the vino and head for<br />\nGreenwich Village, pleasantly high and determined to stay<br />\nthat way. Darkness has fallen, and strobe lights flash from<br />\nthe grimy windows of snops offering paraphernalia of<br />\nevery kind.<br />\n\"Is this an authentic Greenwich Village head shoo?\"<br />\n\"Yeah, real authentic,\" says my Guide sarcastically,<br />\npointing an accusing finger at the Mastercharge sticker on<br />\nthe door. \"And don't bother lookin' for any others\u2014tney<br />\nall take Mastercharge. Existentialism is big business these<br />\ndays. Authenticity my ass.\" We continue along the<br />\nnarrow streets, and my senses are pleasantly accosted by<br />\nsights and sounds. Exotic smells drift streetward from<br />\ndimly-lit restaurants, soft guitar chords waft down from<br />\na fire escape. Everywhere, people are lounging about--on<br />\nthe hoods of cars, on the stoops of nooses. The street is<br />\ntransfomied into an extneded porch, and much of the<br />\ncity's former indifference seems to have melted away.<br />\nWow,\" I innocently exclaim,\"I feel as though I'm in a<br />\nDylan song.\" My Trusty Native Guide throws me a severe<br />\nsideways glance and cautions me that further starry-eyed<br />\noutbursts will not be well received. I have chosen well--he<br />\nis a veteran of blackouts, muggings, and transit strikes,<br />\nand will put up with no malarky.<br />\nTurning a corner, we spy a sandwich board winch<br />\nreads: PITCHERS OF HEINIKEN $3.00. Recovering<br />\nfrom our initial shock, we dash inside and proceed to<br />\nthrow down the cold gold as if the Russians were in<br />\nQueens. After all, how often is it that college students can<br />\nafford the truly aristocratic drunk that only mass<br />\nquantities of Heiniken can provide? Feeling my curiousity<br />\namply lubricated, I begin to press my Trusty Native Guide<br />\nfor information.<br />\n\"Is it just my imagination, or do most of the men in<br />\nthis city look like faggots?\"<br />\n\"A little of both, really.\"<br />\n\"How come the girls here look so much better?\"<br />\n\"Cause this is New York for Christsake! Why don't you<br />\nask something intelligent?\"<br />\n\"You want another pitcher?\"<br />\nApproximately thirty minutes later two thoroughly<br />\njousted Hoppies emerge from the bar and begin to make<br />\ntheir stumbling way toward Bowery Street. My Trusty<br />\nNative Guide has promised to take roe<br />\ntoCBGB's--Manhattan's most infamous punk bar and the<br />\nundisputed rotton core of the Big Apple.<br />\nWe damn near didn't make it.<br />\nIt all all happened so fast, and my brain was so<br />\nincapacitated, that all I remember are fleeting, isolated<br />\nflashes. There is a squealing of tires, a small explosion,<br />\nand then a car careens around the corner, knocking a<br />\nphone booth to the ground. I remember seeing the<br />\ndriver's features; ne is dark-skinned and has a look of<br /><br />\nabsolute terror frozen to his face; nis knuckles are white<br />\nwhere they desperately clutch the wheel, tile hanging dice<br />\nhopelessly entwined about the rear-view mirror. In hot<br />\npursuit is a '57 Chevy with a menacing snowplow welded<br />\nto the front end. As the speeding juggernaut flashes past, I<br />\nsee the R.I.T.E. logo stenciled on the side. Just as quickly<br />\nas the ruckus began, both cars are gone and once again the<br />\nstreet is silent. \"Damn foreign beer,\" curses my Guide,<br />\nbrushing imself off. \"Next time I'll stick with<br />\nBud.\"<br /><br />\nCBGB's appears down the block, and my Guide<br />\noffers word of warning. \"This place,\" he says, \"is a real<br />\ntoilet. But you wanted something authentic.\" After a<br />\nfour-dollar cover charge at tile door and a two-drink<br />\nminimum at the table, I'm convinced it's the most<br />\nexpensive toilet I've ever stuck my tread into, authentic or<br />\notherwise. And if the building itself is a toilet, then the<br />\nclientele is a real open sewer. There are folks sporting dog<br />\ncollars, safety pins, Nazi regalia, and several people \u2022<br />\nof indeterminate gender. In my collegiate garb, I feel<br />\nsomewhat like a moonie at a Hell's Angels picnic.<br />\nA chap at the next table is trying to start a fire in his<br />\nbeer glass, and my Trusty Guide and I are made to<br />\nunderstand that we are to contribute some paper to the<br />\nconflagration or be immediately castrated. Luckily, ne is<br />\nsatisfied with my Social Security card and a picture of<br />\nMom, allowing me to save my last twenty dollar bill from<br />\nconsignment to the flames.<br />\nThe first punkers to arrive onstage are deafening, but<br />\notherwise rather ordinary. The lyrics are unintelligible,<br />\nbut to judge from the riveted attention of the kinky<br />\naficionados down front, the nlace must be full of<br />\nlipreaders. The ever resourceful \"talent\" fills up the long<br />\ninterval between chord ciianges by alternately spitting at<br />\nthe audience and taking long swigs of beer (which are also<br />\noccasionally spewed at the less enthusiastic among the<br />\nfans). Now I ask you\u2014where else can you get such<br />\nentertainment for the reasonable price of only half a<br />\nmint?<br />\n\"D'you come yere often?\" I ask my Guide.<br />\n\"Naw, only after proms.\" Fat and sassy indeed.<br />\nTile second band announces its presence by flinging a<br />\ndead animal into the screaming crowd. During the course<br />\nof the show it will gradually be returned to the stage--a<br />\nlimb at a time. That's what I like to see--audience<br />\nparticipation.<br />\n\"Hey,\" says my Trusty Native Guide. \"You wanna<br />\nhave some fun?\" Fully aware that we are both in a<br />\nquestionable condition, I am overly suspicious.<br />\n'What kinda fun?'<br />\n\"I'm gonna go up there and request some Barry<br />\nManilow. You cover me.\"<br />\nIt's a great place to visit, but I really wouldn't want<br />\nto live there. Hmmm--I've got this strong suspicion that<br />\nNew Yorkers feel much the same way about tile rest of<br />\n. the country. No excuses, though, I'm nooked. I never<br />\ncould see enough, but the cherry blossoms will be busting<br />\nin the Lower Quad, and I've got to get back. However,<br />\nthis is one country boy who's seen the ligut.

That<br />\nBaltimore, where Poe lived for a couple of years, died and<br />\nis buried, should be a Mecca for Poe people is quite<br />\nnatural, but this spring the faithful would be better off<br />\nstaying at home.<br />\nFirst of all, the 125-year-old Westminster Presbyterian<br />\nChurch, in whose graveyard Poe,us wife Virginia and aunt<br />\nMarie Clemm Poe are buried, held its last service this past<br />\nDecember. The graveyard itself, though, is still open to<br />\nthe public. Secondly, Poe's house on Amity Street, his<br />\nBaltimore residence from 1832-5, closed not long<br />\nthereafter for extensive repairs. In a recent newspaper<br />\narticle concerning actor Vincent Price's visit to the house,<br />\nit was disclosed that owing to red tape the renovations<br />\nneeded. to prevent its falling like Usher have not yet<br />\nbegun.<br />\nBack to the den. No shortage of reading material there.<br />\nPoe has been the subject of hundreds of biographies and<br />\ncrifical studies and additional books continue to appear.<br />\nA recenlly published biography of Poe by an English<br />\njournalist, David Sinclair, will soon be followed by<br />\nBarbara and Dwight Steward's novel Evermore, in which<br />\nPoe, who died in 1849, somehow appears in 1889 to solve<br />\na murder mystery. Then in April comes the most<br />\nimpressive and expensive new Poe book, a two-volume,<br />\ncomplete Tales and Sketches, edited by the late Poe<br />\nscholar Thomas Mabbott and priced at $45.<br /><br />\nPoe and his thoughts<br />\nThe Edgar Allan Poe Scrapbook, .a profusely the University of Virginia and West Point wrote<br />\nillustrated, large-format paperback, is a collection of reminiscences of him, the latter an amusing tale of when<br />\narticles, cartoons, photographs, poems, memoirs, stories, Poe took part in \"the eating of a Professor in effigy.\"<br />\nMoving forward in time a bit, tributes to Poe from<br />\nadvertisements and letters.

He might also feel that half-hearted efforts<br />\nare permissable in a town like Baltimore, which after all is<br />\njust the place one passes on the train from Washington to<br />\nNew York. For either or both of these reasons, the Eric<br />\nClapton concert -last Friday night at the Civic Center<br />\nwas merely so-so.<br />\nSupposedly, Baltimore has toe reputation of being a<br />\nbad place in which to play. Clapton surely should not<br />\nhave voiced that complaint.

The crowd lost<br />\ninterest fast and found solace in playing with the green<br />\nfluorescent batons that were being sold all evening.<br />\nAfter the capacity crowd enjoyed a much-deserved<br />\nintermission, the house darkened and Clapton and his<br />\nband struck up \"The Core,\" from his latest album,<br />\nSlowhand. The lackadaisical rendition of this dynamic<br />\nsong keynoted the rest of the program. The band seemed<br />\nto be playing at a slow, sometimes lethargic pace. When<br />\nthe instrumental break and Clapton's first solo of the<br />\nnight came up, the audience reverently leaned forward to<br />\nlisten to tile master.

This<br />\ncompetitiotinertorthe<br />\nqualified<br />\nindividual<br />\nwhich was<br />\nheld Saturday, April 1, capping<br />\nthe four days of championship<br />\nfencing held at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania in Philadelphia.<br />\n\"The competition was<br />\nextremely strong,\" maintained<br />\nKeleher. \"I didn't have one easy<br />\nbout.\" Difficult though the bouts<br />\nmay have been, defeats w.ererare<br />\nfor Keleher, who managed to<br />\nsuffer only one loss in her first<br />\nten bouts.<br /><br />\nThe top fencer at Hopkins<br />\nsince sne was a freshman, Keleher<br />\nis quite accustomed to winning.<br />\nShe lost only two bouts out of<br />\nover forty this season, and one of<br />\nthose losses was vindicated in<br />\nPhiladelphia, when she met her<br />\nadversary, Maureen Syrnick,<br />\nfrom Temple University, in the<br />\nquarter-finals of the individual<br />\ncompetition. The left-handed<br />\nSyrnick, who had trimmed<br />\nKeleher 54 in a dual meet during<br />\nthe season, was unable to answer<br />\nfive straight touches from the<br />\nHopkins ace, leaving the final<br />\nscore 5-0.<br />\nAnother good bout for<br />\nKeleher was against current<br />\nnational champion Sheilah<br />\nArmstrong, from Jersey City<br />\nState College. Armstrong, one of<br />\nthe top four fencers on the U.S.<br />\nOlympic team, gave up four<br />\ntouches before squeaking to a<br />\none-point victory over the<br />\nHopkins pre-law student.<br />\nFreshman Wendy Galfand,<br />\nwho holds down the second (B)<br />\nposition on the squad, came back<br />\nto wrap up ten points after an<br />\neight-bout losing streak in the<br />\nearly part of the match. In a<br /><br />\nBlue Jays Travel To Charlottesville<br />\nBy MARK FISCHER<br />\nTomorrow, the Blue Jay laxers<br />\nstart the heart of their season<br />\nagainst the University of Virginia.<br />\nJohns Hopkins plays the<br />\ntoughtest schedule in lacrosse<br />\nand, in fact, is the only team to<br />\nface all five of the nation's top<br />\nranked teams. In the next few<br />\nsuccessive weeks the Jays will<br />\nplay Virginia, Cornell, Ar.my,<br />\nMaryland, and Navy. Princeton<br />\nprovided a fine warm up for the<br />\nBlue Jays, but Virginia will be<br />\nthe first real test for Mr.<br />\nCiccarone's team.<br />\nThe varsity laxers showed off<br />\ntheir frosh talent in the opener<br />\nagainst Yale, on March 18. Two<br />\nfreshmen, Rich Wilkens and Ned<br />\nRadebaugh, accounted for six<br />\npoints between them. The game's<br />\nreal star, however, turned out to<br />\nbe veteran midfielder Scott<br />\nBaugher who hit the net four<br />\ntimes and helped others to do so<br />\ntwice.<br />\nBlue Jay scorers went to town<br />\nin their ,next game with<br />\nWashington College. Bob<br />\nDeSimone and Dave Huntley<br />\ncontributed four goals apiece to a<br />\n21-31 triumph. In their second<br />\n_game with an Ivy League<br />\nOpponent, the Hopkins stickmen,<br />\nled by fine goaltending from<br />\nMike Federico, beat Harvard by<br />\nthe count of 12-7.<br />\nUnlike last season, the Towson<br />\nState Tigers proved to be no<br />\ncompetition for the Jays when<br />\nthey faced them on Homewood<br />\nField in late March. Dave<br />\nHuntley was the leading scorer in<br />\nthis 22-5 victory with only three<br />\ngoals. Coach Ciccarone was<br />\nPleased with the team's balanced<br />\nscoring attack in this effort.<br />\nWith four wins under their<br />\nbelt, the laxers faced their first<br />\nreal test of the 1978 season and<br />\nfaired well, putting another one<br />\nin the win column by beating<br /><br />\nPrinceton 14 to 7.<br />\nCoached by former Hopkins<br />\nstar Don Zimmerman, Princeton<br />\nfielded a fine team that Mr.<br />\nCiccarone felt was \"the second<br />\nbest team in the Ivy League.\"<br />\nZimmerman graduated from<br />\nJohns Hopkins in 1976 as an<br />\nAll-American midfielder. Last<br />\nseason \"Zim\" coached the<br />\nHopkins B-team and scouted for<br />\nthe varsity, but this year will be<br />\nspent as an assistant at Princeton.<br />\nDespite Zimmerman's efforts<br />\nto prepare his team, the Blue<br />\nJa)rs' awesome offense overcame<br />\nthe Princeton defense 14 times.<br />\nHopkins team captain, Mike<br />\nO'Neill, accounted for four net<br />\nrippers and Jim Bidne hit twice.<br />\nAnother reason for the Jays'<br />\nsuccess is their ground ball<br />\nability, and Bob DeSimone led in<br />\nthat department, getting nine.<br />\nPrinceton was an excellent<br />\nwarm-up for the Jays' mid-season<br />\npush for two reason. One,<br />\nPrinceton provided the best<br />\ntalent to date and two,it got the<br />\nteam used to winning on the<br />\nroad.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins players are Homewood at the beginning of<br />\nanxious to go down to Virginia 'last year and therefore had to sit<br />\non Easter's Weekend and spoil a out last season. Now in nis senior<br />\nlittle of the fun, but perhaps the year, Will \"Wahoo\" Hazelhurst<br />\nmost anxious is defenseman gets a chance to play his former<br />\nWillie Hazelhurst. Willie teammates in a different colored<br />\ntransferred from UVa. to jersey.<br /><br />\nfrom the French to the pistol<br />\ngrip in midstream, after she had<br />\nbeen using the French grip all<br />\nseason.<br />\nAs the third (C) member of<br />\nthe. team, senior Joanne Julius<br />\nadded a healthy eight points ot<br />\nto the tally. The fourth (D) spot<br />\nwas shared by sophomore Kate<br />\nSullivan and senior Valerie Fein,<br />\nwho scored two and seven points<br />\nrespectively, with Fein fencing<br />\nthe majority of the bouts. The<br />\nfinal team score was 43.<br />\n\"We're happy being eighteenth<br />\nagain,\" stated Green, \"because<br />\nthe team really isn't as strong as<br />\nit was last year, and yet it did<br />\njust as well.<br />\n\"The future is very bright, too.<br />\nWe have two freshmen, Carol<br />\nPertowski and Inge Krumpholtz,<br />\nwho will definitely be fencing<br />\nwith the varsity team next year,<br />\nso we ought to have a strong<br />\nteam for years to come.\" The<br />\nwhole team seems enthusiastic<br />\nabout next year. As Galfand<br />\npointed out, \"the team has a lot<br />\nof potential.\"<br />\nAnother possible asset for the<br />\nteam is junior Carol Clarke, who,<br />\nthough she didn't fence this<br />\nsemester, may be back on the<br />\nvarsity squad next year.<br />\nHopkins qualified for the<br />\nnational competition by.<br />\ncapturing first place honors in<br />\nthe Region VI championships.<br />\nThe fencers successfully parried a<br />\nthreat from the Naval ,Academy<br />\nin a crucial final match which left<br />\nNavy in second place behind<br />\nCONTD.
