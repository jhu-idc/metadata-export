L. Somerville, F. Ross Jones, Elmore Wallin<br />\n<br />\nA Matter Of Principle<br />\nDuring the past week a Temple University professor was temporarily removed from that University's faculty for refusing to<br />\nanswer certain questions before a Congressional investigating committee; a world federalist group brought a play expressing their<br />\nphilosophy to Fredericksburg Md., over the bitter denunciations<br />\nof the local American Legion and DAR chapters; and Baltimore<br />\nacademicians have begun adding their opinions to a national debate<br />\nover an issue charged with emotional bias.<br />\nAll three of these recent situations revolve around the central<br />\nproblem of intellectual freedom. How far, it is asked, can man's essential right to think and speak freely be extended without endangering<br />\nour national security? Can we declare certain philosophies out of<br />\nbounds without intimidating the free mind that is a necessary condition<br />\nfor the effective maintenance of a democratic society? Can we continue to give Communists free access to our educational system without<br />\nindirectly fostering an international plot to forcibly over-throw the<br />\ncapitalistic structure? These questions r_epresent the most critical<br />\nintellectual dilemma of the mid-twentieth century. They can and<br />\nmust be met by a rational consideration of the alternatives of action<br />\nthat are available to us and by an unimpassioned weighing of their<br />\nconsequences.<br />\nLet us recognize immediately,/however, that, if stated simply<br />\nas a conflict between freedom and security, the problem is a false<br />\none. Each condition is a necessary prerequisite for the continued<br />\nexistence of the other. He who is politically, economically, or morally<br />\ninsecure can never be free; and, just as assuredly, the man who must<br />\nbend to the dictates of an authoritarian will, in all matters of thou'ght<br />\nand deed, can never be secure. Because the dilemma we face involves<br />\nlimitations upon the degree to which each condition should be<br />\nextended without jeopardizing the other, we face a real problem,<br />\nfor it is in the drawing of lines that the difficulties arise.<br />\n<br />\nAn Examination Two Years<br />\nAfter The Birth Of An Idea<br />\nBy RICHARD ROSE, Asst. Managing Editor<br />\n<br />\nThis is the,second in a series of articles concerning both the academic and non-academic influences of the New Plan since its inception two years ago last month. On February 20, we examined<br />\nthe \"General Philosophy.\" We look this week at the type of student for which it is intended.<br />\nPart II<br />\nTHE EXCEPTION MAN<br />\nThe New Plan has put a different connotation on the term \"Academic Freedom,\" a verbal lacrosse<br />\nball that is normally tossed back<br />\nand forth between professors and<br />\nlegislators, without concerning the<br />\nstudent.<br />\nUnder the New Plan, academic<br />\nfreedom has begun to mean something to the student\u2014the freedom<br />\nto learn what he wants to learn<br />\nas rapidly as he is able. Freedom<br />\nfrom harassment by inflexible rules<br />\nand regulations is extended to the<br />\nstudent level.<br />\nNo longer is a set of absolute<br />\nrequirements in the catalogue the<br />\nmeasure of all men .who seek a<br />\ndegree. Instead, the New Plan has<br />\nabolished virtually all Universitywide requirements.<br />\nDean G. Wilson Shaffer has explained, \"All students will not be<br />\nhandled alike. Everything will<br />\ndepend on the individual student<br />\nand the men in his department<br />\nwho handle him.\"<br />\nKey Is Individual<br />\nThe key to the New Plan is the<br />\nindividual. In effect, each student<br />\ncreates a New Plan for himself,<br />\nby drawing up his own curriculum<br />\nin consultation with his adviser,<br />\nand establshing his own goals for<br />\nan academic degree.<br />\nProfessor George Boas emphasized this when he said, \"Other<br />\nschools have little confidence in<br />\nthe student, but we have. Because<br />\nthe student is young does not mean<br />\nhe is stupid.\"<br />\nHowever, Boas grants that such<br />\nan assumption will not work for<br />\nthe average person.

The remaining four teams<br />\ninclude defending champion Baltimore University, Hopkins,<br />\n<br />\nScorers Led<br />\nBy Margolis<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays, who finished 5th in<br />\nthe M.D. conference, with a 7-3<br />\nrecord, faced a tall, well balanced<br />\nfive that had copped the conference<br />\n<br />\nas much as possible.<br />\nThe sport originated in Canada where it has been adopted by<br />\nlegislative act as the national gamt of the country. No exact date<br />\ncan be given as to when the first game was played, but French<br />\nsettlers who moved into the territory in the early part of the<br />\neighteenth century found the natives playing a game called baggetaway,similar to the present frame of lacrosse.<br />\nIt was, however, different in some ways from the game now<br />\ncarried on in colleges all over the country. The size of the team<br />\nwould vary anywhere from 75 to 200 or even an entire tribe. The<br />\ngame was preceded by quite a ceremony with dancing and general<br />\ncelebrating the night before and the contest itself sometimes lasted<br />\na full week.<br />\nThe goals were set several miles apart. The actual goal line was<br />\ndetermined by a medicine man of each tribe. The line could vary<br />\nduring the contest if one of these medicine men should decide to<br />\ntake a stroll through the country side since the goal line was set<br />\nUp wherever the medicine man was. The goal often moved 5 to<br />\n10 miles in the course of the contest.<br />\nCanadians Name Game<br />\nwas played with a leather ball filled with<br />\nitself<br />\nThe game<br />\nfeathers and of about the same size as the ball in use today. The<br />\nmatch was started by throwing the ball in the air with the warriors<br />\nbattling over it when it hit the ground. The early parts of file<br />\ngame were concentrated on disabling as many of the opponents<br />\nas was possible and occasionally in the heat of the contest a player<br />\nmight \"accidently\" hospitalize one of his own team members. It<br />\nwas not an uncommon sight to have the game going on in one part<br />\nof the field and individual brawls being staged all around the area<br />\nof play.<br />\nIt was the French-Canadians that dubbed the game with the<br />\nname lacrosse. This grew out of the great likeness between the<br />\ncurved stick used by the aborigines and the bishop's crosier. The<br />\nstick at that time was shorter than the one used today and had a<br />\npocket in it just big enough to fit the ball.<br />\nThe speed and excitement of the- sport was contagious and<br />\nsoon the white man picked the game up and as he adopted it as a<br />\nnational recreation certain revisions had to be made on the game.<br />\nFighting and \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" were eliminated and<br />\ndefinite boundaries were set on the field.<br />\nThe only holdover from the original game of baggataway is<br />\na _game played today by the Iriquois in the west called stick ball.<br />\nThis game is played with two sticks about three or four feet in<br />\nlength and having a small pocket in which to carry the ball. Like<br />\nthe old game there are no rules governing play and soon after the<br />\ninitial face off one or both of the sticks are discarded in preference<br />\nto bare fists.<br />\n\"Fastest Game On Two Feet\"<br />\nThe ball can be carried in any manner at all. A popular method<br />\nis carrying the sphere in the player's mouth. The only way that the<br />\nball can be dislodged from this position is to choke the ball carryer<br />\nuntil he coughs up the pellet. In other aspects the two games are<br />\nsimilar also. The contest is usually staged between large groups<br />\nfrom both tribes and there is no boundary to the playing field, or<br />\nrules prohibiting fighting.<br />\nHowever, the sport has gone through many changes limiting<br />\nthe blood letting and is now second only to hockey in speed of<br />\nplay. Roy Taylor of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation summed up the modern day game best in a lecture in<br />\n1929 when he called the stick sport \"the fastest game on two feet;<br />\nthe dash of basketball; the crash of football.\"<br />\n<br />\nchampionship with an unblemished<br />\nslate of 12-0.

How far, it is asked, can man's essential right to think and speak freely be extended without endangering<br />\nour national security? Can we declare certain philosophies out of<br />\nbounds without intimidating the free mind that is a necessary condition<br />\nfor the effective maintenance of a democratic society? Can we continue to give Communists free access to our educational system without<br />\nindirectly fostering an international plot to forcibly over-throw the<br />\ncapitalistic structure? These questions r_epresent the most critical<br />\nintellectual dilemma of the mid-twentieth century. They can and<br />\nmust be met by a rational consideration of the alternatives of action<br />\nthat are available to us and by an unimpassioned weighing of their<br />\nconsequences.<br />\nLet us recognize immediately,/however, that, if stated simply<br />\nas a conflict between freedom and security, the problem is a false<br />\none. Each condition is a necessary prerequisite for the continued<br />\nexistence of the other. He who is politically, economically, or morally<br />\ninsecure can never be free; and, just as assuredly, the man who must<br />\nbend to the dictates of an authoritarian will, in all matters of thou'ght<br />\nand deed, can never be secure. Because the dilemma we face involves<br />\nlimitations upon the degree to which each condition should be<br />\nextended without jeopardizing the other, we face a real problem,<br />\nfor it is in the drawing of lines that the difficulties arise.<br /><br />\nAn Examination Two Years<br />\nAfter The Birth Of An Idea<br />\nBy RICHARD ROSE, Asst.

In effect, each student<br />\ncreates a New Plan for himself,<br />\nby drawing up his own curriculum<br />\nin consultation with his adviser,<br />\nand establshing his own goals for<br />\nan academic degree.<br />\nProfessor George Boas emphasized this when he said, \"Other<br />\nschools have little confidence in<br />\nthe student, but we have.

No exact date<br />\ncan be given as to when the first game was played, but French<br />\nsettlers who moved into the territory in the early part of the<br />\neighteenth century found the natives playing a game called baggetaway,similar to the present frame of lacrosse.<br />\nIt was, however, different in some ways from the game now<br />\ncarried on in colleges all over the country. The size of the team<br />\nwould vary anywhere from 75 to 200 or even an entire tribe. The<br />\ngame was preceded by quite a ceremony with dancing and general<br />\ncelebrating the night before and the contest itself sometimes lasted<br />\na full week.<br />\nThe goals were set several miles apart. The actual goal line was<br />\ndetermined by a medicine man of each tribe. The line could vary<br />\nduring the contest if one of these medicine men should decide to<br />\ntake a stroll through the country side since the goal line was set<br />\nUp wherever the medicine man was. The goal often moved 5 to<br />\n10 miles in the course of the contest.<br />\nCanadians Name Game<br />\nwas played with a leather ball filled with<br />\nitself<br />\nThe game<br />\nfeathers and of about the same size as the ball in use today. The<br />\nmatch was started by throwing the ball in the air with the warriors<br />\nbattling over it when it hit the ground. The early parts of file<br />\ngame were concentrated on disabling as many of the opponents<br />\nas was possible and occasionally in the heat of the contest a player<br />\nmight \"accidently\" hospitalize one of his own team members. It<br />\nwas not an uncommon sight to have the game going on in one part<br />\nof the field and individual brawls being staged all around the area<br />\nof play.<br />\nIt was the French-Canadians that dubbed the game with the<br />\nname lacrosse. This grew out of the great likeness between the<br />\ncurved stick used by the aborigines and the bishop's crosier. The<br />\nstick at that time was shorter than the one used today and had a<br />\npocket in it just big enough to fit the ball.<br />\nThe speed and excitement of the- sport was contagious and<br />\nsoon the white man picked the game up and as he adopted it as a<br />\nnational recreation certain revisions had to be made on the game.<br />\nFighting and \"unsportsmanlike conduct\" were eliminated and<br />\ndefinite boundaries were set on the field.<br />\nThe only holdover from the original game of baggataway is<br />\na _game played today by the Iriquois in the west called stick ball.<br />\nThis game is played with two sticks about three or four feet in<br />\nlength and having a small pocket in which to carry the ball. Like<br />\nthe old game there are no rules governing play and soon after the<br />\ninitial face off one or both of the sticks are discarded in preference<br />\nto bare fists.<br />\n\"Fastest Game On Two Feet\"<br />\nThe ball can be carried in any manner at all. A popular method<br />\nis carrying the sphere in the player's mouth. The only way that the<br />\nball can be dislodged from this position is to choke the ball carryer<br />\nuntil he coughs up the pellet. In other aspects the two games are<br />\nsimilar also. The contest is usually staged between large groups<br />\nfrom both tribes and there is no boundary to the playing field, or<br />\nrules prohibiting fighting.<br />\nHowever, the sport has gone through many changes limiting<br />\nthe blood letting and is now second only to hockey in speed of<br />\nplay. Roy Taylor of the United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse<br />\nAssociation summed up the modern day game best in a lecture in<br />\n1929 when he called the stick sport \"the fastest game on two feet;<br />\nthe dash of basketball; the crash of football.\"<br /><br />\nchampionship with an unblemished<br />\nslate of 12-0.
