We hope that discussion of this<br />\nnon-proposal will be favorable<br />\nDespite 'the hope generated by this new idea, its<br />\nexistence does not erase the impression that the<br />\nAcademic Council is afraid to really try something<br />\nnew.

The Jays mounted a valiant<br />\neffort against the highly rated<br />\nPioneers but went down to their<br />\nfifth straight defeat, 81-76. PMC<br />\ntook advantage of a run of<br />\nice-cold Hopkins' shooting in the<br />\nopening moments of the second<br />\nhalf to break open what had been<br />\na nip and tuck contest. Refusing<br />\nto roll over, the Jays fought back<br />\nto pull within three points in the<br />\nfinal minute, but could not<br />\ntrump a 35-point performance by<br />\nPMC's Wally Rice.<br />\nHopkins finally put it all<br />\ntogether against Western<br />\nMaryland January 15 for their<br />\nlone triumph of the season. Bill<br />\nJews, the high school<br />\nall-American from Cambridge,<br />\nled the way for the victors with a<br />\ngame-high 28 points and an<br />\nincredible 26 rebounds.<br />\nThis 'game saw the Jays open<br />\nthe second half like gangbusters<br />\nto make a mockery of a closely<br />\ncontested first half. The Terrors<br />\nscored only three points in the<br />\nfirst six minutes of the second<br />\nhalf and bowed, 74-60.<br />\nA very disappointing<br />\nperformance against Gettysburg<br />\nCollege January 17 enabled the<br />\nBullets to snap a two-game losing<br />\nstreak against the Jays. Hopkins<br />\njumped out to an 8-0 opening<br />\nlead and owned a 27-18<br />\nadvantage with 5:02 to go in the<br />\nfirst half.<br />\nThe Bullets, however, sparked<br />\nby Jay Bucher (28 points) and<br />\nreserve guard Jay Friedlander (25<br />\npoints), charged to a 33-28<br />\nintermission lead. Hopkins<br />\nregained the lead with six straight<br />\npoints after halftime, but<br />\nGettysburg's hot shooting put<br />\nthe visitors' hopes to rest.

Gary<br />\nHandleman led all scorers in the<br />\ngame with 18 points for Hopkins.<br />\nHaverford extended the Jays'<br />\nmiseries with an 88-82 overtime<br />\ntriumph January 22 in a game<br />\nmarred by two fights (both<br />\nstarted by Red Wave cagers). The<br />\nJays fought back from a tenpoint<br />\ndeficit to send the game into<br />\novertime at 74-74.

They then encountered<br />\nDuke, defeating them 14-13 in an<br />\nextremely close match. The<br />\nvictory was especially sweet as it<br />\nwas Hopkins' first victory over<br />\nDuke in the four year sOes<br />\nbetween the two schools.<br />\nThe team then left for<br />\nChristmas vacation and returned<br />\nto battle an improving Lafayette<br />\nsquad. However, the Blue Jays,<br />\nexpecting a tough match with the<br />\nLeopards, were surprised to find<br />\na shake-up in the Lafayette sabre<br />\nteam, and the result was an easy<br />\n17-10 victory as the Hopkins'<br />\nsabremen took all 9 of their<br />\nbouts.<br /><br />\nThe team then departed for<br />\nNew England and New York. On<br />\nits week-long trip the fencers had<br />\n7 dual meets. First, the<br />\nswordsmen romped over<br />\nSoutheastern Massachusetts by<br />\n23-4, Hopkins' most one-sided<br />\nvictory in recent history. With<br />\nthe outcome never in doubt,,the<br />\nepeemen led the way with a 9-0<br />\nslate.<br />\nThat night, the squad, after<br />\ndriving for several hours, met<br />\nWorchester Poly. Hopkins,<br />\nthough weary, proved too strong<br />\nand eeked out a 15-12 victory.<br />\nOn the following day the Jays<br />\nmet both Harvard and M.I.T. The<br />\nHarvard fencers evidently<br />\nbelieved they would have a<br />\nwalk-a-way match with Hopkins.<br />\nThis was not the case as the Jays<br />\nput up a tremendous fight before<br />\nsuccumbing 16-11 for their first<br />\nloss of the year.<br /><br />\nIt is very probable that several<br />\npersonnel changes would have<br />\ngiven Hopkins a victory. The<br />\ntelling factor, however, was the<br />\nstrong Harvard sabre team which<br />\nwon 8 out of 9 bouts against<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nAttack<br />\nGlenn Pantel and Jeff<br />\nRosenbaum were undefeated in<br />\nfoil (each 3-0).<br />\nThe balance of the Hopkins<br />\nattack was demonstrated by the<br />\nfact that each weapon team was<br />\n5-4, resulting in an exciting 15-12<br />\nvictory. Gary Green led the epee<br />\nteam with 3 victories.<br />\nAfter another long drive, the<br />\nteam encountered N.A.C.<br />\nopponent Pace. The Jays coasted<br />\nto a 22-5 stomp over outclassed<br />\nPace.<br />\nAfter crossing the Brooklyn<br />\nBridge, Hopkins took on<br />\nBrooklyn Poly.
