The<br />\nforemost of these, according to<br />\npresent Grad Club manager<br />\nRandy Diffenderfer, was lack of<br />\npersonnel. He cited a need for<br />\nbartenders, preferably grad students, familiar with the operation of the Club to get it back<br />\ninto operation.<br />\nDiffenderfer also denied a<br />\nrumor that he had quit in order<br />\nto finish the requirements for his<br />\ndegree, thereby closing the Club.<br />\nHe said he was willing to keep<br />\nhis position as long as is necessary for someone to replace him.<br />\nOther factors in the closing<br />\nwere the need to correct some<br />\nviolations of the Health Code<br />\nand to repair damages caused by<br />\nvandalism that had taken place<br />\nduring the previous semester.<br />\nDiffenderfer was neutral on<br />\nthe question of whether the<br />\n<br />\nGrad Club clientele should be<br />\nrestricted to graduate students.<br />\nHe stated that since he started<br />\nworking at the Club three and a<br />\nhalf years ago, business has<br />\nincreased \"ten-fold,\" and he<br />\nexpressed his appreciation of the<br />\nundergraduate support that contributed to this.<br />\nHowever, Diffenderfer added that this significant increase<br />\nin business has caused several<br />\nproblems. One such result was a<br />\ndeparture from the original idea<br />\nof the Grad Club, that of a<br />\nquiet, congenial place for graduate students to congregate, into<br />\nwhat he described as a crowded<br />\nand noisy meeting place for<br />\n<br />\nteaching oen course. Stan on<br />\nwill also teach here next year,<br />\nmost likely her introductory<br />\nsurvey course and one advanced<br />\nlevel Art History course, as<br />\nwell as some courses in the<br />\nEvening College, although the<br />\nexact details have not yet<br />\nbeen worked out. Stein, currently on a leave of absence, said<br />\nhe \"may be staying on in some<br />\nsort of part-time basis next<br />\nyear,\" although the specifics<br />\nof this plan are not yet definite.<br />\nThe professors differ somewhat in their reactions to the<br />\nretirement policy, but all seemed<br />\nto consider it unfair. Chapanis<br />\nsaid he \"hates the idea of<br />\nretiring\" and that \"it sure is<br />\nironic that he will turn 65<br />\nin 1982, the last year in which<br />\nthe loophole may be used.\"<br />\nStein said the administration presented the faculty<br />\nwith \"something less than an<br />\ninvitation to consider the policy<br />\nseriously\" and that the administration's explanation of the<br />\npolicy was \"hazy and indistinct.\".<br />\nBell commented, \"I do<br />\nthink and I've felt right along<br />\nthat the fact that the only group<br />\nsingled out in the nation is<br />\ntenured university professors is a<br />\nform of discrimination. That's a<br />\nbit unbelievable, but my main<br />\ninterest is in my research.

The<br />\ncode is designed to provide a<br />\nstandard procedure for the adjudication of non-academic offenses<br />\ncommitted by undergraduates<br />\nin the Arts and Sciences.<br />\nWednesday's meeting was<br />\nthe first formal debate by the<br />\nCouncil on the issue of the code.<br />\nThe discussion centered around<br />\nSection E, which deals with the<br />\nsanctons against a student who is<br />\ndetermined guilty by the Hearing Panel.<br />\nThe provision for determining sanctions in the version of<br />\nthe code drafted by the Student<br />\nCouncil Student Legal Rights<br />\nCommittee and presented to the<br />\nCouncil by Chairman Karen<br />\nLoebel is as follows: (Sec. E.1)<br />\n\"The Associate Dean of the<br />\nHomewood Faculties is responsible for determining and implementing the sanctions. All sanctions must be in accordance with<br />\nthe severity of the offense.\"<br />\nDebate quickly centered<br />\naround the clause which invests<br />\nthe sole right to determine<br />\nsanctions against a guilty student<br />\nin the office of the Associate<br />\nDean. As the code now stands,<br />\nthe student has the right to<br />\nchoose between the student<br />\nHearing Panel and the Director<br />\nof Student Services as adjudicating authority.<br />\nSome arguments on the<br />\n<br />\nissues developed as follows: It<br />\nwas the opinion of the Student<br />\nLegal Rights Committee, as<br />\nexpressed by Loebel, that the<br />\npower of sanction should rest<br />\nin the hands of the administration because \"It's not fair for<br />\nany student to have that power<br />\nover another student.\" Student<br />\nCouncil President George Connolly agreed with the sentiment.<br />\n\"I feel that the essential question should be guilt or innocence, which can be determined<br />\nby the hearing panel. The onus<br />\nof responsibility for determining<br />\nsanctions should be placed on<br />\nthe administration. If students<br />\nare determining punishments,<br />\nand an accused student feels<br />\nwronged, this can create a<br />\nschism within the student community. A student who feels his<br />\nor her punishment to be excessive can still resort to the appeal<br />\nprocess for satisfaction.\"<br />\nSeveral Council members<br />\nstrongly maintained that a guilty<br />\nstudent should be able to retain<br />\nthe choice of who determines<br />\nthe sanctions, the principle behind this idea being that the<br />\nstudent should be given as much<br />\nfree choice as possible in order<br />\nto insure the protection of his<br />\nrights. An additional point in<br />\nmaintainance of this position is<br />\nthe possibility of administrative<br />\nturnover that could result in a<br />\nphilosophical change in the<br />\nposition of the administrator<br />\ndetermining sanctions.<br />\nA straw vote was taken on<br />\nthe motion \"Should the Asso-<br />\n<br />\ngiefitegoaktit DAT es<br />\n<br />\nCall Days Evenings & Weekends<br />\n<br />\nN 243-1456<br />\nEducational Center<br />\n<br />\nCome Visit Our Center<br />\nTEST PREPARATION<br />\nSPECIALISTS SINCE 1938<br />\n3121 St. Paul Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nCenters in Major US Cities Toronto, Puerto Rico and Zurich, Switzerland<br />\n<br />\nciate Dean be the sole deterThe<br />\nminant of sanctions.\"<br />\n13<br />\nand<br />\nfor<br />\n7<br />\nmotion failed, with<br />\nturned<br />\nthen<br />\nDiscussion<br />\nagainst.<br />\ntowards deciding what body will<br />\nhave power of determining sanctions. Among the suggestions<br />\nwere a separate Sanctions Board<br />\ncomprised of administrators and<br />\nstudents with the administrators<br />\nin the majority and a separate<br />\nboard<br />\nstudent/administrative<br />\nwith the students in the majority. A motion was passed on a<br />\nstraw vote endorsing the Hearing<br />\nPanel with some power of<br />\nsanction.<br />\nSenior Class representative<br />\nto the Student Council Robert<br />\nElkin spoke in favor of students<br />\ndetermining the sanctions. \"I<br />\nthink the potential division<br />\ncaused by students determining<br />\n<br />\npunishments is being overstated.<br />\nThe principle of trial by one's<br />\npeers is carried to its fullest<br />\nextent by having students deciding on sanctions.

I<br />\nsuspect that for many, a more apt simile might involve<br />\nfalling down a well, or being forced to eat an unpalatable, multi-course meal. Let us put aside such quibbling<br />\nwith the sagacity of our ancestors, however, and deal<br />\nwith what we are given. The fact of the matter is that<br />\nmost people, when prompted to describe the process<br />\nof getting on in this vale, insist upon employing such<br />\nstock phrases as \" walking the straight and narrow,\"<br />\n\"the rocky road to success,\" and \"the road less travelled.\" Inaccurate, certainly...but you have to admit<br />\nthey're catchy. Actually, such old standards are merely<br />\na subtle form of euphemism: It's much less angstprovoking for all concerned if you say .\" He trod a hard<br />\nand tortuous path which led to lands obscure\" rather<br />\nthan .\"He pissed in the wind for sixty-odd years.\"<br />\nNow, when the friends of our pre-college days<br />\npart with us and begin to pursue their own differing<br />\ninterests, we are likely to perceive their departures as<br />\ndubious veerings-off from the highroad of our own lives.<br />\nI know that when I announced my intention to come<br />\ntwo thousand miles east in order to persue a degree in<br />\nEnglish, many an old High School chum pictured in their<br />\nmind's eye a narrow cowpath leading to a precipitous<br />\nledge, instead of the yellow-bricked Interstate which I<br />\nsaw stratched out majestically before me.<br />\nFew of us lose touch completely with our closest<br />\nhome-town friends when we come to Hopkins. True, it's<br />\nnot like it used to be, even with them. There's a tediousness in having to sketch in all the background and<br />\nexplain who everybody is before they can enjoy a good<br />\nstory \u2014 but such is the required preface before old<br />\nfriends can appreciate any anecdote which lays its scene<br />\nat Hopkins. And of course, they have to do the same for<br />\nyou.<br />\nIt's a bit like having to light the stovetop burner<br />\nwith a match each time you want to cook, because the<br />\npilot-light has gone out. Still, between people who went<br />\nthrough the horror of puberty shoulder to shoulder, it's<br />\nfar from an insurmountable obstacle. Also, with such<br />\nfriends there has usually been a sufficient, if irregular,<br />\nflow of letters, postcards, and long distance calls which<br />\nhave served to mitigate the long semesters of separation.<br />\nBetween ourselves and true adolescent compatriots, the<br />\nold school tie just needs to be dusted off a bit before the<br />\nintimacy and comraderie return.<br />\nWhere the real potential for psychic pummelling<br />\noccurs is when you look up mere acquaintances after a<br />\ncouple of years' lapse. I'm not talking about friends,<br />\nSlow\"<br />\n<br />\nIt's true what they say...You can't go home.<br />\nnow -- I mean people that you only tolerated; kids who<br />\nwere just there and nothing else. This group includes<br />\nfriends of friends; class officers (whose loathsome job it<br />\nseemed to be to \"know\"everybody); people who for<br />\nsome reason liked you but whom you couldn't stand;<br />\nex-teachers; and, of course, the height of self-destructive<br />\nnostalgia,ex-girlfriends.<br />\nI don't know why Bruce and I decided to set a<br />\nday aside for such folly, but we were sadder men come<br />\nbedtime, let me assure you. Perhaps it was the boredom<br />\nof an Intersession at home, maybe it was the re-run of<br />\n\"Roots\" we had watched the night before...it was<br />\nprobably something in the water, but that is all idle<br />\nspeculation, for the damage is done. Tampering with<br />\none's firmly-held perceptions of-- and prognostications<br />\nfor -- the folks who furnished the backdrop of one's<br />\nadolescence is a dangerous pasttime, and definitely<br />\nnot for the squeamish. I am squeamish. The college<br />\nyears are destructive enough of youthful Weltanschungs<br />\nwithout bothering to find out how utterly wrong you<br />\nwere about absolutely everybody.<br />\nA PUNK GOES DISCO<br />\nBack in the days of learner's permits and Lit<br />\ncream, Gary was something of a knife-wielding guru.<br />\nOur parents considered him to be a textbook \"bad<br />\ninfluence\", which of course went far toward confirming<br />\nour already high opinions of his lifestyle. Gary was a<br />\nwonder to us all. Hell, let's not mince words -- Gary was<br />\na hood.<br />\nI know that it's something of a limpid boast<br />\nthese days, but the man was constantly high. Constantly. His worn-out jean jacket never contained less than a<br />\n<br />\nWarning! Nostalgia can be<br />\n<br />\nTOUCHED<br />\nTHE PEIIII.01<br />\nhalf a dozen joints, and his lunch milk was discreetly<br />\nlaced with vodka. Gary was always the one who had<br />\nmysterious \"connections\" among the upperclassmen,<br />\nand from such shadowy beings a myriad of drugs were<br />\nprocured and chilling tales of cocaine busts and Juvenile<br />\nHall sodomy were disseminated. A despiser of authority<br />\nin any form, Gary seemed to have a sixth sense about<br />\nexactly how much lip each teacher would take, and he<br />\nwas quite creative about the obscene jestures he brazenly<br />\nmade when their backs were turned. Our savant looked<br />\nwith contempt upon all form of academic achievement<br />\nas well as acheivers, boasting that he had never received<br />\nany grade higher than a B-, even in gym. (At our school,<br />\nthat was no mean trick.) His possessions were our<br />\nconstant envy -- he owned a bee-bee rifle, a \"real pistol,\"<br />\na switchblade, a waterbed, and a smoker's cough. In our<br />\neyes, he was the man who had everything.<br />\nGary's parents didn't care about him, and to<br />\nthose of us whose brains were still in the mewling and<br />\npuking stage, that spelled a freedom undreamed-of.<br />\nFrom our safe distance, his life seemed the very essence<br />\nof romanticism, and through him we vicariously broke<br />\nall the rules which in reality we submitted to like so<br />\nmany Beaver Cleavers.<br />\nBruce and I put our heads together, and came to<br />\nthe conclusion that, by now, Gary was most assuredly<br />\ndead.<br />\nWe found him alive, however, in a fast-food joint,<br />\nwearing the same scowl he usually reserved for those<br />\nmaking the Honor Roll -- but this time it was directed<br />\nat an employee. Wonder of wonders, at one of his<br />\nemployees. \"You don't get paid to stand around, Bill.<br />\nIf you're standing around it means I don't need you and<br />\nI let you go. It's as simple as that. There's always<br />\nsomething to do around here, Bill. Remember that or<br />\nyou can go home right now.\"<br />\nFriends, it's a sad thing to see your idol brought<br />\nlow, even when you have long ago ceased to believe in<br />\nhis existence. I felt as though I'd just seen the Ayatollah<br />\nsqueezing tits at Studio 54.<br />\nGary was glad enough to see us, in a reserved<br />\nsort of way. He took off his paper cap (God, but his<br />\nhair was short!) and sat down with us, but he would<br />\nhave nothing of the \"good ole days.\" His talk was all of<br />\nthe present, and his meteoric fast-food future to come.<br />\n\"We do more volume than any other store in the Third<br />\nRegion, and Mr. Heller knows who to thank for that.\"<br />\nhe informed us. \"It shouldn't be long before I'm supervisor here on the east side of town,and the last guy who<br />\nhad that job got transferred upstairs to headquarters at<br />\nDallas. It's a great company, if you're willing to put<br />\nin the work.\"<br />\nBetween descriptions of franchise nirvana, he<br />\nchided us for \"putting things off' by going to school.<br />\n\"Tell you the truth guys,' he confided, \"I don't like to<br />\nhire college kids...<br />\nCollege kids yet. Where does he get off?...<br />\n\"...even for the summer. They just think they're<br />\ntoo good to work.\" Needless to say, Bruce and I were<br />\ndevastated. We'd both had Henry's Hoagie Hovel<br />\npenciled in as our career objectives for a long time now,<br />\nand learning that we were just too foppish for honest<br />\ntoil came as a bitter pill indeed. At one point, the<br />\ndressing-down was interrrupted when our host decided<br />\nthat a group of teenagers \u2014 who, incidentally, looked<br />\nlike so many \"before\" pictures of himself -- had lingered<br />\ntoo long over their hoagies and shakes. While he was<br />\nchasing the gaggle of punks away, Bruce turned to me<br />\nand whispered \"Hey, we were right about Gary. lie is<br />\ndead.\"<br />\nOh, I admit it -- Gary has cleaned up his act,<br />\nalright. But in his zealous scrubbing he's gone beyond<br />\nclean and wound up somewhere on the spooky side of<br />\nsterile. Yes, he's motivated now, and interested in his<br />\nfuture, and has all the markings of a solid citizen, and all<br />\nthat other good stuff. Believe me, if I was head of the<br />\nD.A.R. I'd be thrilled.<br />\nMy God, he even asked us if we wanted to buy a<br />\n\"piping hot apple pie\" for the ride back.<br />\n<br />\nby Cates B<br />\nTHE POWER AND THE GLORY<br />\nI first met Sheila through one of Bruce's old<br />\ngirlfriends. She was one of those rare girls who was<br />\nnever anything but delightfully feminine, and yet who<br />\ncould bring off an occasional racy story or chug a beer<br />\nnow and again. She had the ability to be extremelY<br />\nwitty without appearingin any way bitchy. (Does this<br />\ndescription sound really sexist? Yes? Good.) Sheila was<br />\none of those peers who you always thought of as being a<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nEngaging in this type of foolish activity<br />\ncan easily ruin your entire day.<br />\nfew years older than yourself, though you knew it<br />\nwasn't the case. There wasn't one of our clique who<br />\nhadn't gotten a few cans of liquid courage in him and<br />\nmade a beery pass at some party or football game. She<br />\nalways put such clumsy learchings down with a bit of<br />\nfirm good humor, and rarely held a grudge. Some of us,<br />\nincluding this reporter, had a continuous crush on<br />\nher right up through the twelfth grade, but then I guess<br />\nthat's rather obvious by now. At any rate, Bruce and I<br />\npicked her to visit next because we didn't want another<br />\nnasty surprise, and we figured she was a no-lose proposition. Boy,could we pick 'em.<br />\nThings went well enough at first. She had a<br />\nsmall, tidy apartment in one of those new Casa Nausea<br />\ntype developments, which she'd furnished admirably on<br />\nher salary as a beginning design consultant. The walls<br />\nwere hung with geometrical prints of her own creation,<br />\nand she had a half-finished painting on an easel.<br />\nPretty as ever, too.<br />\nAfter the small talk, I decided to dig in. \"So,<br />\nhow have things really been lately?\" (We newspaper<br />\ntypes ask such penetrating questions as a matter of<br />\ncourse.)<br />\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, my life has reallY,<br />\ntaken a turn for the better in the last few months.<br />\n\"Oh yeah?\" Thinking, with a pang of remorse,<br />\nthat she had probably gotten engaged to some luckY<br />\nyoung lawyer.<br />\n\"Yes...ever since I let the Son of God into my<br />\nlife.\"<br />\n\"Jesus Christ!\" I blurted out, rather undiplomatically.<br />\n\"That's right, Cates. That's what it's all about.<br />\nHave you accepted Jesus as your savior, too?\"<br />\n`.Wha?\" I looked over at Bruce, who had buried<br />\nhis head in his hands and was rocking back and forth.<br />\nSuddenly, the geometrical pictures on the walls came<br />\ninto proper focus, coalescing into the apex of a pair of<br />\npraying hands and the right angles of a wooden cross.<br />\n\"Have you let Jesus into your heart, either of<br />\nyou?\" What was I supposed to say --A don't even let<br />\nJehovah's Witnesses into my home.

I'll<br />\nsay one thing, we were a consistent pair of saps. Below<br />\nare a few of our \"picks\" and the actual results.<br />\nAudrey Brittel: Cheerleader; good brains; good<br />\nboobs; vivacious personality. We figured she'd be top of<br />\nher class and probably engaged to a senator's son. Not<br />\nquite. She put a forty-five to her temple three days<br />\nbefore final exams and blew her \"good brains\" all over<br />\nher roommate's handmade quilt.<br />\nJohn McVicar: Valedictorian; IBM scholarship;<br />\nhead of the Young Republicans. According to Jimmy<br />\nand Bruce the Greeks, this guy was by now being<br />\ngroomed as a rising star in some multinational corporation. Close, but no cigar. He went to Berkeley,couldn't<br />\nhack the pre-med program, dropped out and joined the<br />\nNavy. The latest word was that he was on a hospital<br />\nship recovering from a severe knife wound he received in<br />\na scuffle while on liberty in Barcelona. Pay another<br />\nquarter and try again.<br />\nBill Bowler: Acne sclrred; probably homosexual; desperately unhappy. We had him headed into the<br />\nJesuits. So close, he migrated to California, went into<br />\ntherapy, and works as a nightclub comedian in Los<br />\nAngeles.<br />\nPhil Hawes, whom we always considered a very<br />\nsmart guy, is Colorado coordinator for Jerry Brown.<br />\nBill Sanchez, who I thought was an extremely<br />\ntalented artist with a brilliant career ahead of him, is a<br />\nhot tub distributor in the Southwest.<br />\nAt this point Bruce ripped the phone off the<br />\nwall, so further telephonic humiliation became impossible. No matter though, for I had an Ace in the Hole. I<br />\nthought I saw a way to redeem myself and prove that I<br />\nwas not a totally incompetent judge of human nature. It<br />\ninvolved looking up the one person who I was positive<br />\nwould never perform a behavioral about-face.

It involved looking up my old girlfriend,<br />\nMindy Manngelder.<br />\nET TU, MINDY?<br />\nAh, dear Mindy, how can I describe her? How<br />\ndo her justice? To put it simply, she walked that thin<br />\nborderline between the neurotic and the psychotic in<br />\nsharp, stilleto heels. In a word, the girl was sick. Her<br />\nparents had been through a messy divorce, and she hated<br />\nher father with a passion that spilled over to embrace<br />\nmen in general and yours truely in particular. I must<br />\nexplain: She was the first female who had even shown<br />\nme any kind of attention at all, so of course I was madly<br />\nin love, which accounts for why I put up with all of her<br />\nabuse. For seven long months she subjected me to every<br />\nkind of psychic humiliation and physical frustration<br />\nknown to man and Satan. She fairly delighted in hurting<br />\nme and kept it up because she knew, half-witted puppy<br />\ndog that I was, that I would always come back for more.<br />\nSome people said that Mindy was strikingly pretty,<br />\nothers said that she was merely average --it was all one to<br />\nme, for like I said, I was too much in love to care.<br />\nThis former source of anguish was now my only<br />\nconsolation as darkness closed in on that... stupid... day.<br />\n.\"Once a bitch, always a bitch.!\" I said. \"She'll be all<br />\nhe rotten things I've imagined her to be, you'll see.<br />\nchose borderline crazies never change.\" It seems naive<br />\nnow, but I was supremely confident that, no matter<br />\nwhat else had transpired in the lives of my contemporaries, Mindy Manngelder was still a thoroughly miserable<br />\nhuman being.<br />\nNeed I relate, dear reader, what I found upon<br />\nentering that familiar house anew?<br />\n\"I'm so glad to see you again after all this time.\"<br />\nshe said, and in vain I fratically searched her face for<br />\nsome trace of insincerity. \"I've wanted to call you many<br />\ntimes...to tell you things...but I was afraid you might not<br />\nlisten...after everything I did.\"<br />\nThis wouldn't do. I was sitting on the couch,<br />\nalready breaking into a cold sweat. \"No,no..\"I thought<br />\nto myself. \"Calm yourself! She's just stalling until she<br />\ncan really twist the knife.\"<br />\n\"I was so immature back then.\" she continued in<br />\n<br />\nThe bitch didn't even have the decency to remain one.<br />\nconciliatory tones. \"I was very mean to you, I<br />\nknow...but it was a...difficult time for me.\" A little cry<br />\ncame into her voice. \"And you...you were always so<br />\nsweet through it all. I hope you can forgive me for all<br />\nthe pain I caused you\"<br />\nThis was unbearable! I felt the pillars of my life<br />\ncrumbling and almost clasped my hands over my ears to<br />\nshut out the hateful noise. Was nothing left of the old<br />\nMindy? Where was the sadistic streak I had come to<br />\nknow and despise?<br />\nSuddenly, she .began to blush. \"I'm engaged<br />\nnow.

Unlike<br />\nearlier Clipper teams, who often<br />\nfound it hard to win anywhere, let alone at home, the<br />\n\"new\"Clippers of the fledgling<br />\nEastern Hockey League continue<br />\nto rack up victories on their<br />\nhome ice. In their latest success.<br />\nthe Clips skated to a third-period<br />\ncome-back and a 5-3 triumph<br />\n<br />\nover second place Erie, bringing<br />\nthem to within four point of<br />\nsecond place in the EHL.<br />\nThe Clippers' three goals in<br />\nthe final stanza may have been<br />\nunusual, but they were by<br />\nno means accidental. Tied 2-2<br />\nwith less than a minute left in<br />\nthe second period, an Erie<br />\nbladesman brought in a pass<br />\nwhile offsides and flipped it<br />\ntowards the Clipper nets. While<br />\nthe offense was being overlooked by the officials, Clipper goalie<br />\nJim Weaver blocked the shot.<br />\nThe Clippers were caught without a defenseman, however,<br />\nand the rebound was returned<br />\nby Erie wingman Stan Gulutzan.<br />\nA stunned Clipper squad retreated to the lockers on the short<br />\nend of a 3-2 score.<br />\n<br />\nA sharp between-period<br />\npep-talk from manager Gene<br />\nUbraico brought the Clips out<br />\nwith fire in their eyes, and 2,000<br />\nCivic Center visitors watched in<br />\nawe as the Clipper offense<br />\nracked up three unanswered<br />\ntallies to make the score 5-3,<br />\nClippers. Goals came from Ron<br />\nFriest, Warren Young, and Henry Taylor.<br />\nThe game was<br />\nTaylor's 36th of the season, and<br />\nYoung's 29th two-pointer kept<br />\nhim at the top of the point-scoring standings.<br />\nThis Clipper win continued<br />\na home winning streak that has<br />\nnow been extended to eight<br />\ngames. The seventh win of that<br />\nseries, a 5-2 romp over the<br />\nluckless Hampton Aces on Sunday, marked the departure of<br />\nBaltimore's first and last threegame hockey star. Pete Shier,<br />\na defenseman on loan from the<br />\nCentral Hockey League's Oklahoma City squad, played the<br />\nlast of his three games here and<br />\nripped the Aces for all five<br />\nClipper goals. Although Baltimore's own Ron Friest had set<br />\nfive goals as the EHL record just<br />\na week earlier, Shier's contribution was more astounding as the<br />\nbig, left-handed defenseman was<br />\nswitched to the right wing slot<br />\nfor Sunday's game. Though<br />\nShier had not played as a forward since his college days at<br />\nCornell, he adjusted admirably<br />\nand made his three day's sojourn<br />\nworthwhile.<br />\nOn the road, and without<br />\nShier, the skate was on the other<br />\nfoot as the Hampton Aces took<br />\na 4-1 decision from Baltimore on<br />\nTuesday night. The score could<br />\nhave been closer if the goal<br />\njudges had been a bit more<br />\nperceptive.

Jackson, who agrees with Amen's<br />\nassessment of his improvement,<br />\nhas been finding it difficult to<br />\nget the ball lately as he is often<br />\nkeyed on and has been a victim<br />\nof the opposition's collapsing<br />\nzone defense. With nobody else<br />\non the Jays shooting over 50%<br />\nfrom the floor, Jackson must get<br />\nthe ball inside for the team to<br />\nwin.<br />\nPlaying the forward position, Jackson feels that the<br />\nteam's large reliance upon him<br />\nfor rebounding has limited his<br />\nstyle, getting him in foul trou-<br />\n<br />\nmuch. \"They would not be able<br />\nto key on him as much, allowing<br />\nhim to get the ball inside more<br />\neasily.<br />\nDespite the Jays 3-16 record,<br />\nJackson has seen improvement<br />\nin the team from last year,<br />\nas \"all the players are really<br />\ntogether.\" However, he feels the<br />\nteam has suffered from a lack of<br />\nintensity. \"The team really gets<br />\nup for big games like Virginia<br />\nand Penn State, but there's not<br />\nthe same enthusiasm for the<br />\nWideners and Swarthmores.\"<br />\nWith four games left, the<br />\nJays no longer have a chance for<br />\na playoff spot.

The Jays fell behind<br />\nfrom the start and trailed 40-23<br />\nat the half. Widener shot 55%<br />\nfrom the field and 90% from the<br />\nline in the game. The Jays<br />\nwere led by Jackson, who shot 5<br />\n<br />\nble.

Last fall the<br />\nfootball team was worthy of the<br />\nmost earnest, enthusiastic support which the college could<br />\ngive, and, indeed, at several<br />\ngames there was a fair attendance of Hopkins men \u2022 almost<br />\nentirely undergraduates, how-<br />\n<br />\nWrestlers Merit More Praise<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am unaccustomed to writing letters to your News-Letter,<br />\nas I am a graduate of Towson<br />\nState.<br />\nA certain experience<br />\narose, however, which prompted<br />\nHaving been raised<br />\nwriting.<br />\nin upstate New York, I have<br />\nalways been an avid fan of<br />\nwrestling. I therefore seized the<br />\nopportunity to attend a match;<br />\none which my friends had<br />\nassured me could only end in<br />\nthe humiliation of your Blue<br />\nJays by our own beloved Tigers.<br />\nAlthough going down to defeat,<br />\nthe Jays provided more excitement than I had seen in a while.<br />\nThey were a far cry from the<br />\nhapless team defined by my<br />\npeers. I was particularly impressed by the 118 lb. wrestler,<br />\nBob Cherry, who managed to<br />\ntuma quite capable opponent<br />\n\"every which way but loose.\"<br />\n(to quote a once popluar ballda.)<br />\nI was more than slightly disappointed, therefore, when your<br />\narticle of February 1, did little<br />\nmore than allude to his existence<br />\non the team. Perhaps this is why<br />\nseveral of the sports programs at<br />\nJHU are suffering. How can one<br />\nexpect to get fan support for a<br />\nteam which gets little or no<br />\nPublicity? This is indeed a grave<br />\nresponsibility and one that must<br />\nbe shouldered entirely by your<br />\nstaff. It is beyond my realm of<br />\n<br />\nthought to discern the difficulty<br />\nin publicizing such fine athletes<br />\nas Cherry, Brown and Haladyna,<br />\nall of whom were capable of<br />\ndemolishing Towson opponenti-.I wonder if the Hopkins community is aware of the wrestling<br />\nteam itself, let alone its quality.<br />\nWhere will the strength of this or<br />\nany other program come from<br />\nwhen the \"few bright spots\"<br />\ngraduate? A few team leaders<br />\ncannot provide all the strength<br />\nof a program. This must be<br />\nrpovided by fan interest and<br />\n<br />\npublicity - neither of which<br />\nappear to exist. Hopkins, the<br />\nseeds of a fine team have been<br />\nplanted. Develop them, and you<br />\ncould have a team to rival the<br />\ngreatness of your lacrosse program. Ignore them, and they<br />\ncould go the way Of so many<br />\nother small college teams extinction.<br />\nThe decision is<br />\nyours.<br />\n<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nElaine M.

PARILLO<br />\nFor the second consecutive<br />\nweek, the Hopkins fencers<br />\nturned in a disappointing perTwo weeks ago,<br />\nformance.<br />\nHopkins beat Muhlenberg at<br />\nhome for the 23rd straight<br />\ntime. The Jays next trave1les1 to<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nMason<br />\nGeorge<br />\nThere, the Jays beat Duke,<br />\nonly to be stunned by the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia, and then<br />\nbeaten by George Mason. Last<br />\nweekend, the Hopkins team<br />\nlacked the intensity of the<br />\nSteven's Tech squad, and lost a<br />\nclose contest, 15-12.<br />\nAGainst Stevens, Hopkins<br />\nwas deprived of the services of<br />\n<br />\ntheir number two sabreman,<br />\nAlan Benheim, but the sabre<br />\nteam held their own, winning 5<br />\nbouts to 4. The foil team also<br />\ndid fairly well, losing 5-4,<br />\ndespite a lackluster performance<br />\nfrom the foil leader, Evens<br />\nStarzinger. It was the epee<br />\nteam, which lost 6-3, that<br />\nproved to be the most instrumental in the Hopkins defeat.<br />\nCoach Oles attributed the loss to<br />\nthe lack of experienced men<br />\nwho could be counted on to fill<br />\nthe slack in a close meet.<br />\nTwo weeks ago, Hopkins<br />\nstarted impressively by beating<br />\nMuhlenberge 18-9 and Duke<br />\n17-0. The fencers seemed to<br />\ncont. on 19. 19<br />\n<br />\never. But the backing which the<br />\nteam received was not what it<br />\nshould have been. Threr was no<br />\nreason why twice or three times<br />\nthe number of men could not<br />\nhave been there. At some games<br />\nthere were practically no supporters, and, in consequence, an<br />\nalmost total absence of yelling.<br />\nSuch a state of things was<br />\nenough to discourage any team,<br />\nand it is hardly possible to praise<br />\ntoo much the men who, in<br />\nspite of these adverse circumstances, ended the season as<br />\nstrongly as did last year's eleven.<br />\nNow, why is this so? Surely<br />\nit is not too much to give an<br />\nafternoon or half of an evening<br />\nto supporting the team which is<br />\ndoing so much for Hopkins in<br />\nfootball or hockey, or whatever<br />\nthe particular branch may be.<br />\nThe time is nothing, and in<br />\nmany cases it will be far better<br />\nspent so than if employed over<br />\nbooks. Twenty-five cents as<br />\nadmission fee is not so large a<br />\nsum that it must keep away<br />\nfive-sixths of the men form the<br />\ngame. The reason must be pure<br />\nindiffernece. They say: \"I have<br />\nan engagement,\" or \"I have a<br />\nquiz tomorrow,\" or, the worst<br />\npossible excuse,\"I don't want to<br />\ngo.\" If a man really has an<br />\nimportant engagement, or if he<br />\nabsolutely must work, very well.<br />\nIt is not lack of loyalty that<br />\nkeeps him from the field. But<br />\nthe case of the man who<br />\n\"doesn't want to go\" is far more<br />\nserious. Such an excuse shows<br />\nthat he is indifferent to the best<br />\ninterests of his college; that he<br />\ncares nothing for the self-denial<br />\nand hard work of the men on<br />\nthe team; that he is unwilling to<br />\nmake any effort to repay the<br />\ngood which he has received from<br />\nHopkins and from contact with<br />\nHopkins men; and in a word,<br />\nthat he does not possess the true<br />\nspirit of devotion to his Alma<br />\nMater which should characterize<br />\nevery college student, and, above<br />\nall, every Johns Hopkins stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent. Let us hope that there are.<br />\nfew of this type.<br />\nIt has been said that a new<br />\nera is dawning for Hopkins<br />\nathletics. This may be so, or it<br />\nmay not. The answer depends<br />\non us, the undergraduates. Of<br />\nthe remainder of the University<br />\nwe cannot expect so much.<br />\nTheir work is more pressing and<br />\nmore confining, and it is natural<br />\nthat they should be able to give<br />\nlittle time to athletics. But with<br />\nus the case is different. The<br />\ntrustees of the University have<br />\ndone their part; the coaches are<br />\ndoing theirs; the candidates for<br />\nthe teams are working conscientiously; and let us do the same.<br />\nLet us be willing to make some<br />\nsacrifice, to give up some other..<br />\npleasure, for the sake of supporting our athletics, and let us<br />\nrealize that the man who does so<br />\nwill be working for Johns<br />\nHopkins as truly as her most<br />\nardent supporter, and that,<br />\nthough his sacrifice may be<br />\nunknown and unrecognized by<br />\nthe college world, it will, nevertheless, be one of which he may<br />\nwell be proud.<br />\n<br />\nMA Update<br />\nWith the second semester<br />\nof BIA sports underway,<br />\nClark/Lazear leads Gildersleeve<br />\nby a narrow margin, 244-235,<br />\nin the men's overall dormitory<br />\nchampionship race.

The<br />\nforemost of these, according to<br />\npresent Grad Club manager<br />\nRandy Diffenderfer, was lack of<br />\npersonnel. He cited a need for<br />\nbartenders, preferably grad students, familiar with the operation of the Club to get it back<br />\ninto operation.<br />\nDiffenderfer also denied a<br />\nrumor that he had quit in order<br />\nto finish the requirements for his<br />\ndegree, thereby closing the Club.<br />\nHe said he was willing to keep<br />\nhis position as long as is necessary for someone to replace him.<br />\nOther factors in the closing<br />\nwere the need to correct some<br />\nviolations of the Health Code<br />\nand to repair damages caused by<br />\nvandalism that had taken place<br />\nduring the previous semester.<br />\nDiffenderfer was neutral on<br />\nthe question of whether the<br /><br />\nGrad Club clientele should be<br />\nrestricted to graduate students.<br />\nHe stated that since he started<br />\nworking at the Club three and a<br />\nhalf years ago, business has<br />\nincreased \"ten-fold,\" and he<br />\nexpressed his appreciation of the<br />\nundergraduate support that contributed to this.<br />\nHowever, Diffenderfer added that this significant increase<br />\nin business has caused several<br />\nproblems. One such result was a<br />\ndeparture from the original idea<br />\nof the Grad Club, that of a<br />\nquiet, congenial place for graduate students to congregate, into<br />\nwhat he described as a crowded<br />\nand noisy meeting place for<br /><br />\nteaching oen course. Stan on<br />\nwill also teach here next year,<br />\nmost likely her introductory<br />\nsurvey course and one advanced<br />\nlevel Art History course, as<br />\nwell as some courses in the<br />\nEvening College, although the<br />\nexact details have not yet<br />\nbeen worked out. Stein, currently on a leave of absence, said<br />\nhe \"may be staying on in some<br />\nsort of part-time basis next<br />\nyear,\" although the specifics<br />\nof this plan are not yet definite.<br />\nThe professors differ somewhat in their reactions to the<br />\nretirement policy, but all seemed<br />\nto consider it unfair. Chapanis<br />\nsaid he \"hates the idea of<br />\nretiring\" and that \"it sure is<br />\nironic that he will turn 65<br />\nin 1982, the last year in which<br />\nthe loophole may be used.\"<br />\nStein said the administration presented the faculty<br />\nwith \"something less than an<br />\ninvitation to consider the policy<br />\nseriously\" and that the administration's explanation of the<br />\npolicy was \"hazy and indistinct.\".<br />\nBell commented, \"I do<br />\nthink and I've felt right along<br />\nthat the fact that the only group<br />\nsingled out in the nation is<br />\ntenured university professors is a<br />\nform of discrimination. That's a<br />\nbit unbelievable, but my main<br />\ninterest is in my research.

He had ambivalent feelings about the retirement policy, saying that he<br />\n\"thought the law and Hopkinss's<br />\nreaction to it were pretty unfair,<br />\nbut that he felt a certain sympathy for the administration<br />\nbecause in some fields professors<br />\nhave usually passed their most<br />\ncreative period by the time they<br />\nreach 65.\"<br />\nThe administration's official<br />\n'explanation for its use of the<br />\nretirement exemption is that it<br />\nwill enable the University to<br />\nacquire promising young professors.

The<br />\ncode is designed to provide a<br />\nstandard procedure for the adjudication of non-academic offenses<br />\ncommitted by undergraduates<br />\nin the Arts and Sciences.<br />\nWednesday's meeting was<br />\nthe first formal debate by the<br />\nCouncil on the issue of the code.<br />\nThe discussion centered around<br />\nSection E, which deals with the<br />\nsanctons against a student who is<br />\ndetermined guilty by the Hearing Panel.<br />\nThe provision for determining sanctions in the version of<br />\nthe code drafted by the Student<br />\nCouncil Student Legal Rights<br />\nCommittee and presented to the<br />\nCouncil by Chairman Karen<br />\nLoebel is as follows: (Sec. E.1)<br />\n\"The Associate Dean of the<br />\nHomewood Faculties is responsible for determining and implementing the sanctions. All sanctions must be in accordance with<br />\nthe severity of the offense.\"<br />\nDebate quickly centered<br />\naround the clause which invests<br />\nthe sole right to determine<br />\nsanctions against a guilty student<br />\nin the office of the Associate<br />\nDean. As the code now stands,<br />\nthe student has the right to<br />\nchoose between the student<br />\nHearing Panel and the Director<br />\nof Student Services as adjudicating authority.<br />\nSome arguments on the<br /><br />\nissues developed as follows: It<br />\nwas the opinion of the Student<br />\nLegal Rights Committee, as<br />\nexpressed by Loebel, that the<br />\npower of sanction should rest<br />\nin the hands of the administration because \"It's not fair for<br />\nany student to have that power<br />\nover another student.\" Student<br />\nCouncil President George Connolly agreed with the sentiment.<br />\n\"I feel that the essential question should be guilt or innocence, which can be determined<br />\nby the hearing panel. The onus<br />\nof responsibility for determining<br />\nsanctions should be placed on<br />\nthe administration. If students<br />\nare determining punishments,<br />\nand an accused student feels<br />\nwronged, this can create a<br />\nschism within the student community. A student who feels his<br />\nor her punishment to be excessive can still resort to the appeal<br />\nprocess for satisfaction.\"<br />\nSeveral Council members<br />\nstrongly maintained that a guilty<br />\nstudent should be able to retain<br />\nthe choice of who determines<br />\nthe sanctions, the principle behind this idea being that the<br />\nstudent should be given as much<br />\nfree choice as possible in order<br />\nto insure the protection of his<br />\nrights. An additional point in<br />\nmaintainance of this position is<br />\nthe possibility of administrative<br />\nturnover that could result in a<br />\nphilosophical change in the<br />\nposition of the administrator<br />\ndetermining sanctions.<br />\nA straw vote was taken on<br />\nthe motion \"Should the Asso-<br /><br />\ngiefitegoaktit DAT es<br /><br />\nCall Days Evenings &amp; Weekends<br /><br />\nN 243-1456<br />\nEducational Center<br /><br />\nCome Visit Our Center<br />\nTEST PREPARATION<br />\nSPECIALISTS SINCE 1938<br />\n3121 St. Paul Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21218<br />\nCenters in Major US Cities Toronto, Puerto Rico and Zurich, Switzerland<br /><br />\nciate Dean be the sole deterThe<br />\nminant of sanctions.\"<br />\n13<br />\nand<br />\nfor<br />\n7<br />\nmotion failed, with<br />\nturned<br />\nthen<br />\nDiscussion<br />\nagainst.<br />\ntowards deciding what body will<br />\nhave power of determining sanctions. Among the suggestions<br />\nwere a separate Sanctions Board<br />\ncomprised of administrators and<br />\nstudents with the administrators<br />\nin the majority and a separate<br />\nboard<br />\nstudent/administrative<br />\nwith the students in the majority. A motion was passed on a<br />\nstraw vote endorsing the Hearing<br />\nPanel with some power of<br />\nsanction.<br />\nSenior Class representative<br />\nto the Student Council Robert<br />\nElkin spoke in favor of students<br />\ndetermining the sanctions. \"I<br />\nthink the potential division<br />\ncaused by students determining<br /><br />\npunishments is being overstated.<br />\nThe principle of trial by one's<br />\npeers is carried to its fullest<br />\nextent by having students deciding on sanctions. In addition,<br />\nvis-a-vis the difficulties in passing<br />\nthe code last year, students who<br />\nfear unreasonable harshness<br />\nfrom the administration will find<br />\nthe process of students determining sanctions more acceptable.\"<br />\nA motion was put to the<br />\nfloor which seemed to accommodate both positions: \"The<br />\noriginal adjudicatory authority<br />\n(either the Hearing Panel or the<br />\nDirector of Student Services)<br />\nwill determine the sanctions<br />\nagainst a guilty student. This<br />\ndetermination is subject to two<br />\nstages of appeal, first to the<br />\nAssociate Dean and then to the<br /><br />\nDean of Homewood Faculties.\"<br />\nThis motion passed with 18 in<br />\nfavor and 2 abstentions. Connolly and Loebel will meet with<br />\nthe involved administrators at<br />\nthe end of this week to discuss<br />\nthe proposal. They will report<br />\nback to a special meeting of the<br />\nStudent Council on Sunday at<br />\n7:00 pm, in order to expedite<br />\ndebate on the code so that it<br />\nmight sooner be placed before<br />\nthe students in a referendum.<br />\nIn addition, Connolly reemphasized the importance of<br />\nadopting an adjudicatory code:<br />\n\"Currently there is no definition<br />\nof the process for handling<br />\ncharges against a student.

Some of the<br />\nquestions recently discussed<br />\nhave included:<br />\nAre there<br />\ninherently distinct male and<br />\nfemale characteristics? If so,<br />\nwhat are they and what are their<br />\nramifications for society as a<br /><br />\nwhole and for us in the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity? What is the goal of<br />\nthe Women's Movement? Is it to<br />\nliberate women to function as<br />\nmen in a competitive society or<br />\nis it to liberate women and men<br />\nto co-operate with mutual respect? Need men and women<br />\nexchange roles, or can we share<br />\nthem? What are our options,<br />\nand how do we accomplish<br />\nthem?<br />\nThe M. Carey Thomas<br />\nWomen's Center addresses these<br />\nissues on several levels. We<br />\nsponsor a male/female discussion<br />\ngroup on Sunday evenings at<br />\n6:00 pm in Merryman 121B and<br />\nan all-female group on Thursday<br />\nevenings at 6:00 pm in Homewood apartment 4AA; in both<br />\nof these groups the discussions<br />\nare personal.

I<br />\nsuspect that for many, a more apt simile might involve<br />\nfalling down a well, or being forced to eat an unpalatable, multi-course meal. Let us put aside such quibbling<br />\nwith the sagacity of our ancestors, however, and deal<br />\nwith what we are given. The fact of the matter is that<br />\nmost people, when prompted to describe the process<br />\nof getting on in this vale, insist upon employing such<br />\nstock phrases as \" walking the straight and narrow,\"<br />\n\"the rocky road to success,\" and \"the road less travelled.\" Inaccurate, certainly...but you have to admit<br />\nthey're catchy. Actually, such old standards are merely<br />\na subtle form of euphemism: It's much less angstprovoking for all concerned if you say .\" He trod a hard<br />\nand tortuous path which led to lands obscure\" rather<br />\nthan .\"He pissed in the wind for sixty-odd years.\"<br />\nNow, when the friends of our pre-college days<br />\npart with us and begin to pursue their own differing<br />\ninterests, we are likely to perceive their departures as<br />\ndubious veerings-off from the highroad of our own lives.<br />\nI know that when I announced my intention to come<br />\ntwo thousand miles east in order to persue a degree in<br />\nEnglish, many an old High School chum pictured in their<br />\nmind's eye a narrow cowpath leading to a precipitous<br />\nledge, instead of the yellow-bricked Interstate which I<br />\nsaw stratched out majestically before me.<br />\nFew of us lose touch completely with our closest<br />\nhome-town friends when we come to Hopkins. True, it's<br />\nnot like it used to be, even with them. There's a tediousness in having to sketch in all the background and<br />\nexplain who everybody is before they can enjoy a good<br />\nstory \u2014 but such is the required preface before old<br />\nfriends can appreciate any anecdote which lays its scene<br />\nat Hopkins. And of course, they have to do the same for<br />\nyou.<br />\nIt's a bit like having to light the stovetop burner<br />\nwith a match each time you want to cook, because the<br />\npilot-light has gone out. Still, between people who went<br />\nthrough the horror of puberty shoulder to shoulder, it's<br />\nfar from an insurmountable obstacle. Also, with such<br />\nfriends there has usually been a sufficient, if irregular,<br />\nflow of letters, postcards, and long distance calls which<br />\nhave served to mitigate the long semesters of separation.<br />\nBetween ourselves and true adolescent compatriots, the<br />\nold school tie just needs to be dusted off a bit before the<br />\nintimacy and comraderie return.<br />\nWhere the real potential for psychic pummelling<br />\noccurs is when you look up mere acquaintances after a<br />\ncouple of years' lapse. I'm not talking about friends,<br />\nSlow\"<br /><br />\nIt's true what they say...You can't go home.<br />\nnow -- I mean people that you only tolerated; kids who<br />\nwere just there and nothing else. This group includes<br />\nfriends of friends; class officers (whose loathsome job it<br />\nseemed to be to \"know\"everybody); people who for<br />\nsome reason liked you but whom you couldn't stand;<br />\nex-teachers; and, of course, the height of self-destructive<br />\nnostalgia,ex-girlfriends.<br />\nI don't know why Bruce and I decided to set a<br />\nday aside for such folly, but we were sadder men come<br />\nbedtime, let me assure you. Perhaps it was the boredom<br />\nof an Intersession at home, maybe it was the re-run of<br />\n\"Roots\" we had watched the night before...it was<br />\nprobably something in the water, but that is all idle<br />\nspeculation, for the damage is done. Tampering with<br />\none's firmly-held perceptions of-- and prognostications<br />\nfor -- the folks who furnished the backdrop of one's<br />\nadolescence is a dangerous pasttime, and definitely<br />\nnot for the squeamish. I am squeamish. The college<br />\nyears are destructive enough of youthful Weltanschungs<br />\nwithout bothering to find out how utterly wrong you<br />\nwere about absolutely everybody.<br />\nA PUNK GOES DISCO<br />\nBack in the days of learner's permits and Lit<br />\ncream, Gary was something of a knife-wielding guru.<br />\nOur parents considered him to be a textbook \"bad<br />\ninfluence\", which of course went far toward confirming<br />\nour already high opinions of his lifestyle. Gary was a<br />\nwonder to us all. Hell, let's not mince words -- Gary was<br />\na hood.<br />\nI know that it's something of a limpid boast<br />\nthese days, but the man was constantly high. Constantly. His worn-out jean jacket never contained less than a<br /><br />\nWarning! Nostalgia can be<br /><br />\nTOUCHED<br />\nTHE PEIIII.01<br />\nhalf a dozen joints, and his lunch milk was discreetly<br />\nlaced with vodka. Gary was always the one who had<br />\nmysterious \"connections\" among the upperclassmen,<br />\nand from such shadowy beings a myriad of drugs were<br />\nprocured and chilling tales of cocaine busts and Juvenile<br />\nHall sodomy were disseminated. A despiser of authority<br />\nin any form, Gary seemed to have a sixth sense about<br />\nexactly how much lip each teacher would take, and he<br />\nwas quite creative about the obscene jestures he brazenly<br />\nmade when their backs were turned. Our savant looked<br />\nwith contempt upon all form of academic achievement<br />\nas well as acheivers, boasting that he had never received<br />\nany grade higher than a B-, even in gym. (At our school,<br />\nthat was no mean trick.) His possessions were our<br />\nconstant envy -- he owned a bee-bee rifle, a \"real pistol,\"<br />\na switchblade, a waterbed, and a smoker's cough. In our<br />\neyes, he was the man who had everything.<br />\nGary's parents didn't care about him, and to<br />\nthose of us whose brains were still in the mewling and<br />\npuking stage, that spelled a freedom undreamed-of.<br />\nFrom our safe distance, his life seemed the very essence<br />\nof romanticism, and through him we vicariously broke<br />\nall the rules which in reality we submitted to like so<br />\nmany Beaver Cleavers.<br />\nBruce and I put our heads together, and came to<br />\nthe conclusion that, by now, Gary was most assuredly<br />\ndead.<br />\nWe found him alive, however, in a fast-food joint,<br />\nwearing the same scowl he usually reserved for those<br />\nmaking the Honor Roll -- but this time it was directed<br />\nat an employee. Wonder of wonders, at one of his<br />\nemployees. \"You don't get paid to stand around, Bill.<br />\nIf you're standing around it means I don't need you and<br />\nI let you go. It's as simple as that. There's always<br />\nsomething to do around here, Bill. Remember that or<br />\nyou can go home right now.\"<br />\nFriends, it's a sad thing to see your idol brought<br />\nlow, even when you have long ago ceased to believe in<br />\nhis existence. I felt as though I'd just seen the Ayatollah<br />\nsqueezing tits at Studio 54.<br />\nGary was glad enough to see us, in a reserved<br />\nsort of way. He took off his paper cap (God, but his<br />\nhair was short!) and sat down with us, but he would<br />\nhave nothing of the \"good ole days.\" His talk was all of<br />\nthe present, and his meteoric fast-food future to come.<br />\n\"We do more volume than any other store in the Third<br />\nRegion, and Mr. Heller knows who to thank for that.\"<br />\nhe informed us. \"It shouldn't be long before I'm supervisor here on the east side of town,and the last guy who<br />\nhad that job got transferred upstairs to headquarters at<br />\nDallas. It's a great company, if you're willing to put<br />\nin the work.\"<br />\nBetween descriptions of franchise nirvana, he<br />\nchided us for \"putting things off' by going to school.<br />\n\"Tell you the truth guys,' he confided, \"I don't like to<br />\nhire college kids...<br />\nCollege kids yet. Where does he get off?...<br />\n\"...even for the summer. They just think they're<br />\ntoo good to work.\" Needless to say, Bruce and I were<br />\ndevastated. We'd both had Henry's Hoagie Hovel<br />\npenciled in as our career objectives for a long time now,<br />\nand learning that we were just too foppish for honest<br />\ntoil came as a bitter pill indeed. At one point, the<br />\ndressing-down was interrrupted when our host decided<br />\nthat a group of teenagers \u2014 who, incidentally, looked<br />\nlike so many \"before\" pictures of himself -- had lingered<br />\ntoo long over their hoagies and shakes. While he was<br />\nchasing the gaggle of punks away, Bruce turned to me<br />\nand whispered \"Hey, we were right about Gary. lie is<br />\ndead.\"<br />\nOh, I admit it -- Gary has cleaned up his act,<br />\nalright. But in his zealous scrubbing he's gone beyond<br />\nclean and wound up somewhere on the spooky side of<br />\nsterile. Yes, he's motivated now, and interested in his<br />\nfuture, and has all the markings of a solid citizen, and all<br />\nthat other good stuff. Believe me, if I was head of the<br />\nD.A.R. I'd be thrilled.<br />\nMy God, he even asked us if we wanted to buy a<br />\n\"piping hot apple pie\" for the ride back.<br /><br />\nby Cates B<br />\nTHE POWER AND THE GLORY<br />\nI first met Sheila through one of Bruce's old<br />\ngirlfriends. She was one of those rare girls who was<br />\nnever anything but delightfully feminine, and yet who<br />\ncould bring off an occasional racy story or chug a beer<br />\nnow and again. She had the ability to be extremelY<br />\nwitty without appearingin any way bitchy. (Does this<br />\ndescription sound really sexist? Yes? Good.) Sheila was<br />\none of those peers who you always thought of as being a<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nEngaging in this type of foolish activity<br />\ncan easily ruin your entire day.<br />\nfew years older than yourself, though you knew it<br />\nwasn't the case. There wasn't one of our clique who<br />\nhadn't gotten a few cans of liquid courage in him and<br />\nmade a beery pass at some party or football game. She<br />\nalways put such clumsy learchings down with a bit of<br />\nfirm good humor, and rarely held a grudge. Some of us,<br />\nincluding this reporter, had a continuous crush on<br />\nher right up through the twelfth grade, but then I guess<br />\nthat's rather obvious by now. At any rate, Bruce and I<br />\npicked her to visit next because we didn't want another<br />\nnasty surprise, and we figured she was a no-lose proposition. Boy,could we pick 'em.<br />\nThings went well enough at first. She had a<br />\nsmall, tidy apartment in one of those new Casa Nausea<br />\ntype developments, which she'd furnished admirably on<br />\nher salary as a beginning design consultant. The walls<br />\nwere hung with geometrical prints of her own creation,<br />\nand she had a half-finished painting on an easel.<br />\nPretty as ever, too.<br />\nAfter the small talk, I decided to dig in. \"So,<br />\nhow have things really been lately?\" (We newspaper<br />\ntypes ask such penetrating questions as a matter of<br />\ncourse.)<br />\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, my life has reallY,<br />\ntaken a turn for the better in the last few months.<br />\n\"Oh yeah?\" Thinking, with a pang of remorse,<br />\nthat she had probably gotten engaged to some luckY<br />\nyoung lawyer.<br />\n\"Yes...ever since I let the Son of God into my<br />\nlife.\"<br />\n\"Jesus Christ!\" I blurted out, rather undiplomatically.<br />\n\"That's right, Cates. That's what it's all about.<br />\nHave you accepted Jesus as your savior, too?\"<br />\n`.Wha?\" I looked over at Bruce, who had buried<br />\nhis head in his hands and was rocking back and forth.<br />\nSuddenly, the geometrical pictures on the walls came<br />\ninto proper focus, coalescing into the apex of a pair of<br />\npraying hands and the right angles of a wooden cross.<br />\n\"Have you let Jesus into your heart, either of<br />\nyou?\" What was I supposed to say --A don't even let<br />\nJehovah's Witnesses into my home. Not knowing what<br />\nto do, I made some terrible joke about trying to cut<br />\ndown on cholesterol.<br />\n\" I really don't think you should jest about<br />\nmatters of salvation.

We should have<br />\nquit while we still had at least some illusions left, but a<br />\nkind of morbid fatality seemed to hang over us, pushing<br />\nUS farther toward the Abyss despite our better judgement.<br />\nGOODBYE, MR. CHIPS<br />\nWhile I was nursing my second C.C. on the rocks,<br />\nI slowly became aware of a familiar silhouette seated<br />\nalone at one of the other tables. Ave Maria, it was none<br />\nother than Father Gumbatt, my old high school English<br />\nteacher! Being the product of a Jesuit education, I<br />\nwas used to seeing my instructors in various saloons, but<br />\nFather Gumbatt's slouching demeanor and three day<br />\ngrowth struck a disturbing note. This was the selfsame<br />\nman who had first opened my eyes to the wonders of<br />\nliterature, first stripped the veil away from the magic of<br />\nShakespeare, Milton, Wordsworth and Dickens. It was<br /><br />\n)er<br /><br />\nof<br /><br />\nEly<br />\n;.\"<br />\nse,<br /><br />\nkY<br /><br />\nnY<br /><br />\nit.<br /><br />\ned<br />\n:h.<br /><br />\nof<br />\nss.<br />\nof<br />\nlet<br />\nlat<br />\nut<br />\nut<br /><br />\nSadly\u201e I found Father Gumbatt to be much changed.<br />\nhis burning enthusiasm for the treasures of the language<br />\nthat had wooed me away from my childhood ambition<br />\nof becoming a carnival barker and set me on the road to<br />\nliterary criticism. Bounding up from the table, I literally<br />\nran across the bar room to the side of my old mentor.<br />\n\"Father Gumbatt! How are you?\"<br />\nHe winced and looked up at me with a pained<br />\nexpression on his face. \"You talk very loudly, son. Who<br />\nthe hell are you, anyway?\" I told him my name and<br />\nasked if he didn't remember me from class.<br />\n\"Yes, yes. I remember you, alright. Calm down.<br />\nAnd don't call me 'Father.' I've left the Order. The<br />\nOnly reason I wear this collar now is so I can get free<br /><br />\ndrinks in Irish bars and talk my way out of drunk driving<br />\ntickets on my way home. Sit down, since you're obviously going to anyway. What're you doing with<br />\nyourself these days, Baldhead?\"<br />\n\"Baldridge.\"<br />\n\"Right. What are you up to?\"<br />\nI told him my plans for earning a PhD in English,<br />\nwhich prompted an even sourer expression on his part<br />\nthan my initial appearance.<br />\n\"You idiot. Why the hell do you wanna do<br />\nsomething like that for?\"<br />\nConfused and a bit hurt, I explained to him that<br />\nhe and no one else had been the fountainhead of my<br />\ninterest in literature.<br />\n\"Don't blame me for your wasted life.\" he<br />\ngrowled, ordering another boilermaker. \"I'm not taking<br />\nthe rap for your mistakes! English? Pah! Nobody<br />\nreads anymore, Baldhead. What use is anybody going to<br />\nhave for a literature major when all they can do is watch<br />\nthe tube?\"<br />\nHe downed another libation and continued his<br />\nexegesis. \"I had a couple of kids in my last class who<br />\ncouldn't even tell time because they'd never seen anything besides a digital clock! And as for writing -haven't you heard? It's all passe! Kids today don't<br />\nwrite,- he said, jabbing a finger contemptuously at his<br />\ncocktail napkin, \"They just punch out some pre-fab<br />\nanswer on a damn computer console! There won't be<br />\nanyone for you to teach, Bloodridge. Why bother with a<br />\ndictionary when the only words left in students' vocabulary is 'really' and 'let's party?' You might as well drop<br />\nout now and get into refrigerator repair before it's too<br />\nlate.\"<br />\nI was crushed. Here was my prime mover with<br />\nhis wheel in the ditch and his nose in a glass of bourbon.<br />\nI felt lost, I felt betrayed...worse than that, I felt downright unemployable. Ordering several drinks to go, I<br />\ngathered up Bruce and shuffled out into the cold to<br />\nmeet more quick-change phantoms from our past.<br />\nRANDOM SHOTS<br />\nThe next few inquiries were made over the<br />\nphone, under the mistaken assumption that it wouldn't<br />\nbe as traumatic to find out the bad news that way. I'll<br />\nsay one thing, we were a consistent pair of saps. Below<br />\nare a few of our \"picks\" and the actual results.<br />\nAudrey Brittel: Cheerleader; good brains; good<br />\nboobs; vivacious personality. We figured she'd be top of<br />\nher class and probably engaged to a senator's son. Not<br />\nquite. She put a forty-five to her temple three days<br />\nbefore final exams and blew her \"good brains\" all over<br />\nher roommate's handmade quilt.<br />\nJohn McVicar: Valedictorian; IBM scholarship;<br />\nhead of the Young Republicans. According to Jimmy<br />\nand Bruce the Greeks, this guy was by now being<br />\ngroomed as a rising star in some multinational corporation. Close, but no cigar. He went to Berkeley,couldn't<br />\nhack the pre-med program, dropped out and joined the<br />\nNavy. The latest word was that he was on a hospital<br />\nship recovering from a severe knife wound he received in<br />\na scuffle while on liberty in Barcelona. Pay another<br />\nquarter and try again.<br />\nBill Bowler: Acne sclrred; probably homosexual; desperately unhappy. We had him headed into the<br />\nJesuits. So close, he migrated to California, went into<br />\ntherapy, and works as a nightclub comedian in Los<br />\nAngeles.<br />\nPhil Hawes, whom we always considered a very<br />\nsmart guy, is Colorado coordinator for Jerry Brown.<br />\nBill Sanchez, who I thought was an extremely<br />\ntalented artist with a brilliant career ahead of him, is a<br />\nhot tub distributor in the Southwest.<br />\nAt this point Bruce ripped the phone off the<br />\nwall, so further telephonic humiliation became impossible. No matter though, for I had an Ace in the Hole. I<br />\nthought I saw a way to redeem myself and prove that I<br />\nwas not a totally incompetent judge of human nature. It<br />\ninvolved looking up the one person who I was positive<br />\nwould never perform a behavioral about-face. It in-<br /><br />\nvolved the one stable personality in a world seemingly<br />\ngone mad. It involved looking up my old girlfriend,<br />\nMindy Manngelder.<br />\nET TU, MINDY?<br />\nAh, dear Mindy, how can I describe her? How<br />\ndo her justice? To put it simply, she walked that thin<br />\nborderline between the neurotic and the psychotic in<br />\nsharp, stilleto heels. In a word, the girl was sick. Her<br />\nparents had been through a messy divorce, and she hated<br />\nher father with a passion that spilled over to embrace<br />\nmen in general and yours truely in particular. I must<br />\nexplain: She was the first female who had even shown<br />\nme any kind of attention at all, so of course I was madly<br />\nin love, which accounts for why I put up with all of her<br />\nabuse. For seven long months she subjected me to every<br />\nkind of psychic humiliation and physical frustration<br />\nknown to man and Satan. She fairly delighted in hurting<br />\nme and kept it up because she knew, half-witted puppy<br />\ndog that I was, that I would always come back for more.<br />\nSome people said that Mindy was strikingly pretty,<br />\nothers said that she was merely average --it was all one to<br />\nme, for like I said, I was too much in love to care.<br />\nThis former source of anguish was now my only<br />\nconsolation as darkness closed in on that... stupid... day.<br />\n.\"Once a bitch, always a bitch.!\" I said. \"She'll be all<br />\nhe rotten things I've imagined her to be, you'll see.<br />\nchose borderline crazies never change.\" It seems naive<br />\nnow, but I was supremely confident that, no matter<br />\nwhat else had transpired in the lives of my contemporaries, Mindy Manngelder was still a thoroughly miserable<br />\nhuman being.<br />\nNeed I relate, dear reader, what I found upon<br />\nentering that familiar house anew?<br />\n\"I'm so glad to see you again after all this time.\"<br />\nshe said, and in vain I fratically searched her face for<br />\nsome trace of insincerity. \"I've wanted to call you many<br />\ntimes...to tell you things...but I was afraid you might not<br />\nlisten...after everything I did.\"<br />\nThis wouldn't do. I was sitting on the couch,<br />\nalready breaking into a cold sweat. \"No,no..\"I thought<br />\nto myself. \"Calm yourself! She's just stalling until she<br />\ncan really twist the knife.\"<br />\n\"I was so immature back then.\" she continued in<br /><br />\nThe bitch didn't even have the decency to remain one.<br />\nconciliatory tones. \"I was very mean to you, I<br />\nknow...but it was a...difficult time for me.\" A little cry<br />\ncame into her voice. \"And you...you were always so<br />\nsweet through it all. I hope you can forgive me for all<br />\nthe pain I caused you\"<br />\nThis was unbearable! I felt the pillars of my life<br />\ncrumbling and almost clasped my hands over my ears to<br />\nshut out the hateful noise. Was nothing left of the old<br />\nMindy? Where was the sadistic streak I had come to<br />\nknow and despise?<br />\nSuddenly, she .began to blush. \"I'm engaged<br />\nnow. I mention that only because<br />\nknow I<br />\nfrustrated you terribly.., in a physical way. I mean.<br />\nAnd...well... if I could I'd do something to make up col<br />\nit. There's Bob now...but...I somehow feel I ought to do<br />\nit anyway, as a kind of atonement. Of course. I know<br />\nthat one time could never make up for all the...\"<br />\nARGGGHHHHH! THIS WAS THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL! I come to see a psychopath and<br />\nfind... repentence! civility! kindness! I thought I was<br />\ngoing to vomit. We talked a little more and it soon<br />\nbecame only too clear that my Mindy had turned into a<br />\ncharming young woman of deep feeling and high intellect. I was desolate. Turning down her offer of sexual<br />\nreparations, I left the house a broken man.<br />\nHYPERBOLIC CONCLUSION<br />\nI have written this account as a warning to those<br />\nwho would attempt a piece of folly similar to mine.<br />\nDesist! Desist before it's too late. For if you try to lift<br />\nthe hooped skirt of your preconceptions about others,<br />\nyou will find that Truth has only varicose veins on her<br />\nlegs and cellulite on her thighs. Persist in your shallow<br />\nillusions and haphazard pigeon-holing of otheis. Persist<br />\nin your foolish notions about how others livek have<br />\ngone. Persist, if you value your peace of mind. For life<br />\nis not a road, or a path, or a highway.

The seventies was a<br />\ndecade rich with innovative and technically competent animation, but unfortunately, few people outside of the cinematic<br />\nsubculture would know that.

Unlike<br />\nearlier Clipper teams, who often<br />\nfound it hard to win anywhere, let alone at home, the<br />\n\"new\"Clippers of the fledgling<br />\nEastern Hockey League continue<br />\nto rack up victories on their<br />\nhome ice. In their latest success.<br />\nthe Clips skated to a third-period<br />\ncome-back and a 5-3 triumph<br /><br />\nover second place Erie, bringing<br />\nthem to within four point of<br />\nsecond place in the EHL.<br />\nThe Clippers' three goals in<br />\nthe final stanza may have been<br />\nunusual, but they were by<br />\nno means accidental. Tied 2-2<br />\nwith less than a minute left in<br />\nthe second period, an Erie<br />\nbladesman brought in a pass<br />\nwhile offsides and flipped it<br />\ntowards the Clipper nets. While<br />\nthe offense was being overlooked by the officials, Clipper goalie<br />\nJim Weaver blocked the shot.<br />\nThe Clippers were caught without a defenseman, however,<br />\nand the rebound was returned<br />\nby Erie wingman Stan Gulutzan.<br />\nA stunned Clipper squad retreated to the lockers on the short<br />\nend of a 3-2 score.<br /><br />\nA sharp between-period<br />\npep-talk from manager Gene<br />\nUbraico brought the Clips out<br />\nwith fire in their eyes, and 2,000<br />\nCivic Center visitors watched in<br />\nawe as the Clipper offense<br />\nracked up three unanswered<br />\ntallies to make the score 5-3,<br />\nClippers. Goals came from Ron<br />\nFriest, Warren Young, and Henry Taylor.<br />\nThe game was<br />\nTaylor's 36th of the season, and<br />\nYoung's 29th two-pointer kept<br />\nhim at the top of the point-scoring standings.<br />\nThis Clipper win continued<br />\na home winning streak that has<br />\nnow been extended to eight<br />\ngames. The seventh win of that<br />\nseries, a 5-2 romp over the<br />\nluckless Hampton Aces on Sunday, marked the departure of<br />\nBaltimore's first and last threegame hockey star. Pete Shier,<br />\na defenseman on loan from the<br />\nCentral Hockey League's Oklahoma City squad, played the<br />\nlast of his three games here and<br />\nripped the Aces for all five<br />\nClipper goals. Although Baltimore's own Ron Friest had set<br />\nfive goals as the EHL record just<br />\na week earlier, Shier's contribution was more astounding as the<br />\nbig, left-handed defenseman was<br />\nswitched to the right wing slot<br />\nfor Sunday's game. Though<br />\nShier had not played as a forward since his college days at<br />\nCornell, he adjusted admirably<br />\nand made his three day's sojourn<br />\nworthwhile.<br />\nOn the road, and without<br />\nShier, the skate was on the other<br />\nfoot as the Hampton Aces took<br />\na 4-1 decision from Baltimore on<br />\nTuesday night.

Last fall the<br />\nfootball team was worthy of the<br />\nmost earnest, enthusiastic support which the college could<br />\ngive, and, indeed, at several<br />\ngames there was a fair attendance of Hopkins men \u2022 almost<br />\nentirely undergraduates, how-<br /><br />\nWrestlers Merit More Praise<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI am unaccustomed to writing letters to your News-Letter,<br />\nas I am a graduate of Towson<br />\nState.<br />\nA certain experience<br />\narose, however, which prompted<br />\nHaving been raised<br />\nwriting.<br />\nin upstate New York, I have<br />\nalways been an avid fan of<br />\nwrestling.

I was particularly impressed by the 118 lb. wrestler,<br />\nBob Cherry, who managed to<br />\ntuma quite capable opponent<br />\n\"every which way but loose.\"<br />\n(to quote a once popluar ballda.)<br />\nI was more than slightly disappointed, therefore, when your<br />\narticle of February 1, did little<br />\nmore than allude to his existence<br />\non the team. Perhaps this is why<br />\nseveral of the sports programs at<br />\nJHU are suffering. How can one<br />\nexpect to get fan support for a<br />\nteam which gets little or no<br />\nPublicity? This is indeed a grave<br />\nresponsibility and one that must<br />\nbe shouldered entirely by your<br />\nstaff.

A few team leaders<br />\ncannot provide all the strength<br />\nof a program. This must be<br />\nrpovided by fan interest and<br /><br />\npublicity - neither of which<br />\nappear to exist.

The foil team also<br />\ndid fairly well, losing 5-4,<br />\ndespite a lackluster performance<br />\nfrom the foil leader, Evens<br />\nStarzinger. It was the epee<br />\nteam, which lost 6-3, that<br />\nproved to be the most instrumental in the Hopkins defeat.<br />\nCoach Oles attributed the loss to<br />\nthe lack of experienced men<br />\nwho could be counted on to fill<br />\nthe slack in a close meet.<br />\nTwo weeks ago, Hopkins<br />\nstarted impressively by beating<br />\nMuhlenberge 18-9 and Duke<br />\n17-0. The fencers seemed to<br />\ncont. on 19. 19<br /><br />\never. But the backing which the<br />\nteam received was not what it<br />\nshould have been. Threr was no<br />\nreason why twice or three times<br />\nthe number of men could not<br />\nhave been there. At some games<br />\nthere were practically no supporters, and, in consequence, an<br />\nalmost total absence of yelling.<br />\nSuch a state of things was<br />\nenough to discourage any team,<br />\nand it is hardly possible to praise<br />\ntoo much the men who, in<br />\nspite of these adverse circumstances, ended the season as<br />\nstrongly as did last year's eleven.<br />\nNow, why is this so? Surely<br />\nit is not too much to give an<br />\nafternoon or half of an evening<br />\nto supporting the team which is<br />\ndoing so much for Hopkins in<br />\nfootball or hockey, or whatever<br />\nthe particular branch may be.<br />\nThe time is nothing, and in<br />\nmany cases it will be far better<br />\nspent so than if employed over<br />\nbooks. Twenty-five cents as<br />\nadmission fee is not so large a<br />\nsum that it must keep away<br />\nfive-sixths of the men form the<br />\ngame. The reason must be pure<br />\nindiffernece. They say: \"I have<br />\nan engagement,\" or \"I have a<br />\nquiz tomorrow,\" or, the worst<br />\npossible excuse,\"I don't want to<br />\ngo.\" If a man really has an<br />\nimportant engagement, or if he<br />\nabsolutely must work, very well.<br />\nIt is not lack of loyalty that<br />\nkeeps him from the field. But<br />\nthe case of the man who<br />\n\"doesn't want to go\" is far more<br />\nserious. Such an excuse shows<br />\nthat he is indifferent to the best<br />\ninterests of his college; that he<br />\ncares nothing for the self-denial<br />\nand hard work of the men on<br />\nthe team; that he is unwilling to<br />\nmake any effort to repay the<br />\ngood which he has received from<br />\nHopkins and from contact with<br />\nHopkins men; and in a word,<br />\nthat he does not possess the true<br />\nspirit of devotion to his Alma<br />\nMater which should characterize<br />\nevery college student, and, above<br />\nall, every Johns Hopkins stu-<br /><br />\ndent. Let us hope that there are.<br />\nfew of this type.<br />\nIt has been said that a new<br />\nera is dawning for Hopkins<br />\nathletics. This may be so, or it<br />\nmay not. The answer depends<br />\non us, the undergraduates.

But with<br />\nus the case is different. The<br />\ntrustees of the University have<br />\ndone their part; the coaches are<br />\ndoing theirs; the candidates for<br />\nthe teams are working conscientiously; and let us do the same.<br />\nLet us be willing to make some<br />\nsacrifice, to give up some other..<br />\npleasure, for the sake of supporting our athletics, and let us<br />\nrealize that the man who does so<br />\nwill be working for Johns<br />\nHopkins as truly as her most<br />\nardent supporter, and that,<br />\nthough his sacrifice may be<br />\nunknown and unrecognized by<br />\nthe college world, it will, nevertheless, be one of which he may<br />\nwell be proud.<br /><br />\nMA Update<br />\nWith the second semester<br />\nof BIA sports underway,<br />\nClark/Lazear leads Gildersleeve<br />\nby a narrow margin, 244-235,<br />\nin the men's overall dormitory<br />\nchampionship race.
