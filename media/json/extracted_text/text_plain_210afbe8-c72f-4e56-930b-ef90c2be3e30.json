His doctrines were as cloudy<br />\nthen as those of the European<br />\ndictttors when they were first<br />\nexpounded. Where Mussolini invented fascism and gave it a name,<br />\nPeron has his \"justicialism\" with<br />\n\"social justice.\" Under \"justicialism,\" the government sees to it<br />\nthat no one part of society exploits another. The idea in itself<br />\nserves a valuable political purpose.<br />\n\"Justicialism\" sounds good and<br />\ngives Peron an effective screen<br />\nbehind which he can further his<br />\nideals.<br />\nTo achieve economic freedom,<br />\nPeron has nationalized the central<br />\nbank which gives him complete<br />\ncontrol over all the economic resources of the country. He purchased the railroads from the British stockholders at his own price.<br />\nSince the devaluation of the pound<br />\nhas made the low price they paid<br />\neven lower, those stockholders are<br />\nsuffering under the circumstances<br />\nwhich Peron took advantage of.<br />\nThe telephone company he bought<br />\nfrom the International Telephone<br />\nand Telegraph Company: an American corporation.<br />\nTo attain social justice, he is<br />\ncontinually drafting new wage<br />\nscales and giving seniority benefits to labor groups. By doing this<br />\nhe has succeeded in throwing the<br />\ncountry into an inflation which has<br />\nraised the dollar-peso exchange<br />\nrate from four pesos to twenty<br />\nfor one American dollar.<br />\n\"... From My Feelings \u2022 ..\"<br />\nWhen Juan Peron married Eva<br />\nDuarte, he recognized the possibilities of using her as a pawn in<br />\nhis game with the labor. Consequently, Peron gave her a position<br />\nin the Ministry of Labor and, within a short time, the Minister of<br />\nLabor became a virtual 'messenger<br />\nboy while Evita was the boss.<br />\nShe worked from dawn to midnight at her new job and interviewed everyone from ambassadors<br />\nto butchers.<br />\nEva Peron has a sharp political<br />\nmind and an instinctive sense of<br />\npsychology. It is unfortunate that<br />\nher education was so limited because her sense of, economics is<br />\nShe granted prenonexistant.<br />\nposterous wage boosts and the<br />\nentire nation felt the repercussions. She herself admitted,\"Most<br />\nof the time, if not always, my<br />\ndecisions come from my feelings<br />\nrather than anything else. I can<br />\nrarely give reasons for my actions.\".<br />\nThe telephone workers, for example, started bargaining for a<br />\n70 percent wage hike, hoping to<br />\nget 30 percent. Evita saw to it<br />\nthat they got 70. Another example<br />\nis the case of the railroad workers<br />\nwho asked for a 40 percent boost.<br />\nEvita thought they should get 50<br />\nand they did. This resulted in<br />\nsupport for the Peron regime but<br />\nwreaked havoc with the economy.<br />\nAt latest reports, wages in Argentina had risen anywhere from 40<br />\nto 80 percent.<br />\nTo increase the labor force,<br />\nPeron had a decree passed that<br />\nforbade farmers to have their own<br />\nsons working for them on their<br />\nfarms. The farmer can keep one<br />\nson on the farm if he pays him the<br />\nminimum wage but the rest must<br />\nwork elsewhere, preferably in the<br />\n<br />\ncities and factories. As a consequence, farm labor is very scarce<br />\nand very expensive.<br />\nEvita's method of administering charity in her Social Aid<br />\nFoundation is an institution in<br />\nitself. She has daily sessions in<br />\nthe morning with anyone who has<br />\na complaint of any sort, legitimate<br />\nor otherwise. After listening to<br />\ntheir sob-stories, she doles out<br />\nfifty-peso bills and does anything<br />\nelse she can to alleviate the situation. Her foundation has set up a<br />\nvery plush hotel where she sends<br />\ncharity cases to live in luxury for<br />\na limited time, whereupon they<br />\nreturn to their squalid homes, happy with their memories for a good<br />\nmany years to come. In the summer of 1949 she chose 600 boys<br />\nfrom the meanest, poorest hovels<br />\nin the vountry and sent them off<br />\non a vacation at one of the best<br />\nhotels in Mar del Plata, a summer resort for the wealthy. After<br />\ntwo weeks they were sent home<br />\nagain.

In the tiara-<br />\n<br />\nBy Elmore Wallin, Sports Editor<br />\nThe Athletic Department question arose again this week in the<br />\nStudent. Council meeting and, to say the least, a fiery debate followed. A motion was put before the group to decide whether or<br />\nnot the investigations should be continued. The Vote was in favor<br />\nof its continuance, overruling the arguments of some of the<br />\nschools top athletes who are members of that group. Scofty<br />\nDouthett, varsity soccer goalie, got up and left the meeting with<br />\n- the terse comment that he had better things to do with his time.<br />\nThroughout the debate Scotty had been completely in favor of<br />\ndropping the whol issue because he felt, as does this writer, that<br />\nthe whole thing is being handled in the wrong way and, hi reality,<br />\nisn't as big an issue as it has been blown up to be.<br />\nSince one of the primary purposes of the News-Letter is to<br />\nvoice student opinions, Douthett's story follows.<br />\n\"Every student who attends Hopkins under the de-emphasis<br />\nprogram usually begins his athletic career by complaining about<br />\n\u2022the policy and comparing it, unfavorably of course,.with his dear<br />\nold high school where there was plenty of everything for redblooded American boys like himself. Most of us oulgrow that<br />\njuvenile stage and come to respect the Hopkins system for<br />\nwhat it is, an opportunity for any and all interested parties to<br />\nengage in their favorite sports. ITnfortunately there is always<br />\na stnaH group of itinnature students who can IleVey bring themselves to part with glories of happy Harry High School.<br />\n\"Recently such a group instigated an investigation of the<br />\nathletic department in the best traditions of the witch hunt, with<br />\nloud cries of '-unfair' and `Fraud.\"fo my mind this investigation<br />\nis a disgrace, and I feel that the Student Council showed very<br />\npoor taste in lending, its support to this small minority of malcontents.<br />\n\"Verbal and printed attacks were made against our Athletic<br />\nDirector,.aceusing him of a disproportionate allocation of finances<br />\nto certain sports. As far as I could see, the sums must have been<br />\nsufficient in every case, since the planned programs for every<br />\nsport were carried out satisfactorily, and, without exception,<br />\nthere was a surplus in each department. It scents ridiculous<br />\nto attack a man for ineffieiency and had faith when that man<br />\nsuccessfully runs an eleven sport athletic program on a budget<br />\nwhich is roughly equivalent to Navy's annual allotment for<br />\nfencing alone. Perhaps it is a misdemeanor to be competent in<br />\nhtis day and age. Appareutly the investigating committee thinks<br />\n<br />\nsquad contests last year Dix was<br />\nalways practicing against the same<br />\nmen and rarely got the experience<br />\nof playing against strange players.<br />\nAs a result, he has a tendency to<br />\nwander a little too far from the<br />\nnet and often fights for the ball<br />\nten to fifteen feet behind the goal.<br />\nThree goals were scored with<br />\nno one in the net in the two<br />\ngames. This, however, Fewster<br />\nfeels is not serious and will pass<br />\n<br />\nOn the whole the team seems and Kelson.<br />\nto be shaping up very well. At the<br />\nMentor Pope emphasized, howpresent time the attack looks to<br />\never, that this lineup was subject<br />\nbe one of the strongest in.college<br />\nto change at anytime. He said<br />\nranks, and the defense is getting<br />\nformed<br />\nstronger. This is.particularly note- that a B team was being<br />\nworthy considering the adverse for the members V the twenty<br />\nconditions under which the squad<br />\nhas been training. The field is a<br />\nsea of mud and has been for the<br />\nlast two weeks. Besides this, the<br />\ncool weather. has prevented the<br />\nplayers from keeping loose while<br />\non the sidelines waiting to get<br />\ninto the game.<br />\n<br />\ntalent Er,ointz to waste.\"<br />\n<br />\nbut<br />\nare<br />\nPer<br />\nPhc<br />\nope<br />\nor<br />\n<br />\nman squad who couldn't play in<br />\nthe regular matches.

Moreover, complaints were lodged that equipment was not<br />\nas good as it might have been and that scheduling was not extensive<br />\nenough iii sonic of the minor sports. This might well be true, but<br />\nthe filet remains that both equipment and scheduling were adequate, that is, they were adequate for those boys who were sincerely<br />\ninterested in playing the game. I feel, and most of the Hopkins<br />\nathletes that I know feel, that a boy who really likes the sport<br />\nwill play that sport regardless of the conditions as long as the<br />\nequipment and schedule are simply adequate. It is only those<br />\nboy. who are more interested in the frills, the silk warm-up<br />\nsuits, the brand-new, shiny shoes, the sparkling. uniforms, than<br />\nthey are in the game itself who will be deterred from competing<br />\nby the absence of the ornameiitative display needed to satisfy<br />\ntheir parched egos. The essentials are amply provided; the other<br />\nelements are unnecessary.<br />\n\"And what about scheduling? The tennis team complains<br />\nbeeause the Athletic Director refuses to schedule two matches per<br />\nseason with Towson State Teachers. The team argues that this<br />\nwould enable them to fatten their record, since they know that<br />\nthey can beat Towson. Perhaps there is a fallacy in my reasoning,<br />\nbut to me the very purpose of a sporting contest is defeated if<br />\none group is certain of victory and plays Only with an eye on<br />\nthe won and lost columns. This is sport ?<br />\n\"rndoubtedly this committee will feverishly uncover a few<br />\nminor discrepancies to which they will attach great significance,<br />\nbut had they directed their efforts in almost any field they would<br />\nhave ben able to do quite the same thing. An investigation of<br />\nthe Writing Department would probably reveal that too much<br />\nmoney is being allocated to novelists while the poor poets quietly<br />\nsit and starve.<br />\nIt therefore seems to me that the Student Council and<br />\nthose who supported them in this investigation are affected with<br />\nthe same malady that some members of the tennis team possess,<br />\na desire to pad their reco'rd at the expense of some virtually helpless party. Perhaps if these men approached the Athletic Diiirctor,<br />\nthey could have bear-baiting installed as a part of our intercollegiate athletic program.

From My Feelings \u2022 ..\"<br />\nWhen Juan Peron married Eva<br />\nDuarte, he recognized the possibilities of using her as a pawn in<br />\nhis game with the labor. Consequently, Peron gave her a position<br />\nin the Ministry of Labor and, within a short time, the Minister of<br />\nLabor became a virtual 'messenger<br />\nboy while Evita was the boss.<br />\nShe worked from dawn to midnight at her new job and interviewed everyone from ambassadors<br />\nto butchers.<br />\nEva Peron has a sharp political<br />\nmind and an instinctive sense of<br />\npsychology. It is unfortunate that<br />\nher education was so limited because her sense of, economics is<br />\nShe granted prenonexistant.<br />\nposterous wage boosts and the<br />\nentire nation felt the repercussions. She herself admitted,\"Most<br />\nof the time, if not always, my<br />\ndecisions come from my feelings<br />\nrather than anything else. I can<br />\nrarely give reasons for my actions.\".<br />\nThe telephone workers, for example, started bargaining for a<br />\n70 percent wage hike, hoping to<br />\nget 30 percent. Evita saw to it<br />\nthat they got 70. Another example<br />\nis the case of the railroad workers<br />\nwho asked for a 40 percent boost.<br />\nEvita thought they should get 50<br />\nand they did. This resulted in<br />\nsupport for the Peron regime but<br />\nwreaked havoc with the economy.<br />\nAt latest reports, wages in Argentina had risen anywhere from 40<br />\nto 80 percent.<br />\nTo increase the labor force,<br />\nPeron had a decree passed that<br />\nforbade farmers to have their own<br />\nsons working for them on their<br />\nfarms. The farmer can keep one<br />\nson on the farm if he pays him the<br />\nminimum wage but the rest must<br />\nwork elsewhere, preferably in the<br /><br />\ncities and factories. As a consequence, farm labor is very scarce<br />\nand very expensive.<br />\nEvita's method of administering charity in her Social Aid<br />\nFoundation is an institution in<br />\nitself. She has daily sessions in<br />\nthe morning with anyone who has<br />\na complaint of any sort, legitimate<br />\nor otherwise. After listening to<br />\ntheir sob-stories, she doles out<br />\nfifty-peso bills and does anything<br />\nelse she can to alleviate the situation. Her foundation has set up a<br />\nvery plush hotel where she sends<br />\ncharity cases to live in luxury for<br />\na limited time, whereupon they<br />\nreturn to their squalid homes, happy with their memories for a good<br />\nmany years to come. In the summer of 1949 she chose 600 boys<br />\nfrom the meanest, poorest hovels<br />\nin the vountry and sent them off<br />\non a vacation at one of the best<br />\nhotels in Mar del Plata, a summer resort for the wealthy. After<br />\ntwo weeks they were sent home<br />\nagain. Hardly a professional method of conducting charity but it is<br />\nEvita's way and has won her<br />\ntremendous support.<br />\nIt might be mentioned here that<br />\nEva is one of the richest women<br />\nin the world. She has a horde of<br />\njewels which Argentines claim is<br />\nthe largest owned by any woman<br />\nsince Cleopatra. Nearly all her<br />\ngowns are imported from France<br />\nand most of them are designed<br />\nexclusively for her. Three large<br />\nrooins of closets lined with immense cupboSrds are needed to<br />\nhouse her wardrobe.<br />\nThe public reaction to the extravagant Mrs. Peron, who dresses<br /><br />\nsuperbly in Dior creations adorned<br />\nwith Van Cleef jewelry to attend a street cleaners rally at nine<br />\nin the moi\u2022ning, is much the same<br />\nas the British reaction to seeing<br />\nthe royal family going on almost<br />\nas usual, seemingly unaffected by<br />\nthe austerity program. _<br />\nPeron Story Familiar<br />\nThere are unmistakable signs of<br />\na familiar pattern as the Peron<br />\nstory unfolds.

The<br />\nlittle things are apparent at first:<br />\nthe title Lider (leader, Fuerbrer,<br />\nCaudillo, Duce\u2014they're all the<br />\nsame); the slogan apparent at<br />\nevery turn in Argentina, \"Peron<br />\nCumple\" (Peron Accomplishes)<br />\nwhich mimics Il Duce's \"Mussolini is Always Right.\" Like, Mussolini and Hitler, President Peron<br />\nhas gone on a building spree<br />\nnew tenements, stadiums, swimming pools, and public buildings.<br />\nFrom such minor parallels one<br />\ncan move to more basic features.<br />\nJust as Mussolini had his Carta<br />\ndel Lavaro or Labor Charter, so<br />\ndoes Peron have his Derechos del<br />\nTrabajo or Rights of Labor. At<br />\nthis point a difference arises in the<br />\nparallel. Neither Hitler or Mussolini had the labor force behind<br />\nthem in de beginning as did<br />\nPeron, but the end result'was the<br />\nsame. Complete control over labor<br />\nwas obtained by naming faithful<br />\nfollowers to lead the labor unions.<br />\nThe Argentine constitution of<br />\n1853, based on the United States<br />\nConstitution, has been abolished<br />\nby Peron and in its place he has<br />\nwritten one of his own.

In the tiara-<br /><br />\nBy Elmore Wallin, Sports Editor<br />\nThe Athletic Department question arose again this week in the<br />\nStudent. Council meeting and, to say the least, a fiery debate followed. A motion was put before the group to decide whether or<br />\nnot the investigations should be continued. The Vote was in favor<br />\nof its continuance, overruling the arguments of some of the<br />\nschools top athletes who are members of that group. Scofty<br />\nDouthett, varsity soccer goalie, got up and left the meeting with<br />\n- the terse comment that he had better things to do with his time.<br />\nThroughout the debate Scotty had been completely in favor of<br />\ndropping the whol issue because he felt, as does this writer, that<br />\nthe whole thing is being handled in the wrong way and, hi reality,<br />\nisn't as big an issue as it has been blown up to be.<br />\nSince one of the primary purposes of the News-Letter is to<br />\nvoice student opinions, Douthett's story follows.<br />\n\"Every student who attends Hopkins under the de-emphasis<br />\nprogram usually begins his athletic career by complaining about<br />\n\u2022the policy and comparing it, unfavorably of course,.with his dear<br />\nold high school where there was plenty of everything for redblooded American boys like himself. Most of us oulgrow that<br />\njuvenile stage and come to respect the Hopkins system for<br />\nwhat it is, an opportunity for any and all interested parties to<br />\nengage in their favorite sports. ITnfortunately there is always<br />\na stnaH group of itinnature students who can IleVey bring themselves to part with glories of happy Harry High School.<br />\n\"Recently such a group instigated an investigation of the<br />\nathletic department in the best traditions of the witch hunt, with<br />\nloud cries of '-unfair' and `Fraud.\"fo my mind this investigation<br />\nis a disgrace, and I feel that the Student Council showed very<br />\npoor taste in lending, its support to this small minority of malcontents.<br />\n\"Verbal and printed attacks were made against our Athletic<br />\nDirector,.aceusing him of a disproportionate allocation of finances<br />\nto certain sports. As far as I could see, the sums must have been<br />\nsufficient in every case, since the planned programs for every<br />\nsport were carried out satisfactorily, and, without exception,<br />\nthere was a surplus in each department. It scents ridiculous<br />\nto attack a man for ineffieiency and had faith when that man<br />\nsuccessfully runs an eleven sport athletic program on a budget<br />\nwhich is roughly equivalent to Navy's annual allotment for<br />\nfencing alone. Perhaps it is a misdemeanor to be competent in<br />\nhtis day and age. Appareutly the investigating committee thinks<br /><br />\nsquad contests last year Dix was<br />\nalways practicing against the same<br />\nmen and rarely got the experience<br />\nof playing against strange players.<br />\nAs a result, he has a tendency to<br />\nwander a little too far from the<br />\nnet and often fights for the ball<br />\nten to fifteen feet behind the goal.<br />\nThree goals were scored with<br />\nno one in the net in the two<br />\ngames. This, however, Fewster<br />\nfeels is not serious and will pass<br /><br />\nOn the whole the team seems and Kelson.<br />\nto be shaping up very well. At the<br />\nMentor Pope emphasized, howpresent time the attack looks to<br />\never, that this lineup was subject<br />\nbe one of the strongest in.college<br />\nto change at anytime. He said<br />\nranks, and the defense is getting<br />\nformed<br />\nstronger. This is.particularly note- that a B team was being<br />\nworthy considering the adverse for the members V the twenty<br />\nconditions under which the squad<br />\nhas been training. The field is a<br />\nsea of mud and has been for the<br />\nlast two weeks. Besides this, the<br />\ncool weather. has prevented the<br />\nplayers from keeping loose while<br />\non the sidelines waiting to get<br />\ninto the game.<br /><br />\ntalent Er,ointz to waste.\"<br /><br />\nbut<br />\nare<br />\nPer<br />\nPhc<br />\nope<br />\nor<br /><br />\nman squad who couldn't play in<br />\nthe regular matches.

Moreover, complaints were lodged that equipment was not<br />\nas good as it might have been and that scheduling was not extensive<br />\nenough iii sonic of the minor sports. This might well be true, but<br />\nthe filet remains that both equipment and scheduling were adequate, that is, they were adequate for those boys who were sincerely<br />\ninterested in playing the game. I feel, and most of the Hopkins<br />\nathletes that I know feel, that a boy who really likes the sport<br />\nwill play that sport regardless of the conditions as long as the<br />\nequipment and schedule are simply adequate. It is only those<br />\nboy. who are more interested in the frills, the silk warm-up<br />\nsuits, the brand-new, shiny shoes, the sparkling. uniforms, than<br />\nthey are in the game itself who will be deterred from competing<br />\nby the absence of the ornameiitative display needed to satisfy<br />\ntheir parched egos. The essentials are amply provided; the other<br />\nelements are unnecessary.<br />\n\"And what about scheduling? The tennis team complains<br />\nbeeause the Athletic Director refuses to schedule two matches per<br />\nseason with Towson State Teachers. The team argues that this<br />\nwould enable them to fatten their record, since they know that<br />\nthey can beat Towson. Perhaps there is a fallacy in my reasoning,<br />\nbut to me the very purpose of a sporting contest is defeated if<br />\none group is certain of victory and plays Only with an eye on<br />\nthe won and lost columns. This is sport ?<br />\n\"rndoubtedly this committee will feverishly uncover a few<br />\nminor discrepancies to which they will attach great significance,<br />\nbut had they directed their efforts in almost any field they would<br />\nhave ben able to do quite the same thing. An investigation of<br />\nthe Writing Department would probably reveal that too much<br />\nmoney is being allocated to novelists while the poor poets quietly<br />\nsit and starve.<br />\nIt therefore seems to me that the Student Council and<br />\nthose who supported them in this investigation are affected with<br />\nthe same malady that some members of the tennis team possess,<br />\na desire to pad their reco'rd at the expense of some virtually helpless party. Perhaps if these men approached the Athletic Diiirctor,<br />\nthey could have bear-baiting installed as a part of our intercollegiate athletic program.

By the fall<br />\nof 194S, that talent had materialized into an experienced, integrated team, one that had posted a<br />\n5-2-1 record for the previous season. At the helm was \"Howdy\"<br />\nMyers, with his \"J\" backfield formation and trick sneak plays.<br />\nThe first blow to the team was<br />\nthe hardest one.
