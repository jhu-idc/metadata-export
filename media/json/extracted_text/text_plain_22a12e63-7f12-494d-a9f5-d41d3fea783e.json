The group<br />\nthen established a salary range<br />\nfor each job.<br />\nAt present, Pipkin stated, all<br />\n<br />\nHomewood employees are being<br />\nreimbursed above the minimum<br />\nof their specified pay range. \"The<br />\nfirst effect of the reassessment,\"<br />\nhe said, \"was that any employee<br />\nwho had been salaried below the<br />\nminimum established was raised<br />\nto at least the minimum.\"<br />\nAll salaries will not be adjusted<br />\nwithin- the assessed range for<br />\nsome time, though. \"Starting a<br />\nplan like this is like boarding a<br />\ntrain in motion,\" he explained.<br />\n\"We can't arbitrarily change or<br />\nreduce salaries to conform with<br />\nthe scale.\"<br />\n\"The remaining changes will<br />\nbe phased in over some period of<br />\ntime,\" he added.<br />\nPipkin said he believes the<br />\nuniform pay scale, in addition to<br />\nfacilitating compliance with<br />\nfederal legislation, will improve<br />\nemplyee morale somewhat. \"All<br />\nmanagement theoriests say that<br />\nequitable pay is a necessity for<br />\nemployee satisfaction,\" he<br />\nstated. \"With a uniform pay<br />\nsystem, employees can be<br />\ncompletely certain that they are<br />\nbeing reimbursed fairly.\"<br />\nDuring the course of the job<br />\nreassessment, all employees filled<br />\n<br />\nout a job description<br />\nquestionnaire which was<br />\nreviewed and supplemented by<br />\ndepartment supervisors.<br />\nThe supervisors also<br />\nparticipated in what Pipkin terms<br />\n\"the validation step,\" in which<br />\nthe new job code and the method<br />\nof assessment were<br />\ndem onstrated.<br />\nPipkin said that in some cases<br />\nthe code was modified on the<br />\nrecommendation of supervisors,<br />\nwho had first-hand knowledge of<br />\nthe responsibilities of specific<br />\npositions.<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Pipkin<br />\n<br />\norder to raise $100 million,<br />\nincluding 50 $1 million endowed<br />\nchairs.<br />\nClasses will be suspended<br />\ntomorrow at 1 p.m. so that<br />\nmembers of the community will<br />\nbe able to attend.

It<br />\nwas one of those rare moments<br />\nwhen someone you admire and<br />\nrespect opens up his heart and<br />\nlets you see all the anguish and<br />\npain inside. The end of the song<br />\nwas a moment where no amount<br />\nof applause or words could<br />\ndefine or express your<br />\nsatisfaction and quiet thanks, a<br />\ntime for reflection.<br />\nThe audience didn't quite<br />\n<br />\ncatch the mood.
