After a careful<br />\ncomparison of prices charged at<br />\nthe university store and those<br />\nasked by leading downtown concerns, it is evident that the complaints are unfounded and that<br />\ndowntown figures are as large, and<br />\nin some cases considerably larger<br />\nthan those charged at the university.<br />\nAs concerns stationery, one article for which students considered<br />\nthemselves overcharged was the<br />\nVenus drawing pencil. The price<br />\nof this pencil is 10 cents at the<br />\nuniversity, and nowhere down<br />\ntown, so far as is known, can it be<br />\nobtained for less. All notebook<br />\npaper, which is now selling for 12<br />\ncents a package at the bookstore,<br />\nis 15 cents at a number of stores<br />\nin the city. Thus Hopkins students are actually getting their<br />\nPaper cheaper than would be possible elsewhere. The quality of<br />\nthe paper and the size of the packages are the same at all places.<br />\nAs regards the S. P. cardboard<br />\nnotebooks prices vary greatly. The<br />\nsmaller sizes which sell for 55 and<br />\n35 cents at the bookstore are the<br />\nsame down town, but the larger<br />\nsized books can be bought for from<br />\n5 to 10 cents less at one dealers,<br />\nwhile prices at other stores are<br />\nconsiderably higher than bookstore quotations.<br />\nNot one case was found where a<br />\ntext book was less expensive in<br />\ntown than at the university. The<br />\ngreat majority of books sell for<br />\nthe same price everywhere, and<br />\nmany instances were found where<br />\n13 to 18 per cent. can be saved<br />\nby buying books at the bookstore.<br />\nHaugh's \"Practical Exporting\" is<br />\nthe same in town as at the bookstore, as also are Kimball's<br />\n\"Physics,\" Karapetoff's \"Experimental Electrical Engineering,\"<br />\nHoldsworth's \"Money and Bankmg,\" Smith's \"Descriptive Geometry,\u201d Clelard's \"Geology,\" Breese's<br />\n\"Psychology\" and many other<br />\nbooks on a number of diversified<br />\nsubjects.<br />\nIt was pointed out at a number<br />\nof stores that prices change almost<br />\nfrom day to day, with the result<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 4)<br />\n<br />\nLOME ENSQTRITR<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., FEBRUARY 15, 1921<br />\nMAJOR DE BLES AGAIN ADDRESSES ASSEMBLY ON<br />\nWORLD WAR<br />\n<br />\nDR.

The battle of Verdun was one of the most<br />\nimportant of the war, economically, politically and in a military<br />\nand dynastic way. The economic<br />\nand military reasons were that the<br />\nFrench were concentrating their<br />\nforces on the line between Paris<br />\nand Verdun, because of the coal<br />\nand iron fields of the Saar. The<br />\nGerman reserves were low, the<br />\nFrench high, but they had deceived<br />\nthe Germans by withholding casThe British forces<br />\nualty lists.<br />\nwere increasing and the Russians<br />\nbeginning to awake. So the Germans decided to attack the French<br />\nline, since it was much the longest<br />\nof the three, and for strategic reasons they picked out Verdun. It<br />\nwas near their fortress of Metz,<br />\nand there was a bulge in the line<br />\nthere in which they thought' to entrap thousands of French: The<br />\ndynastic \u2022 \u2022 reason was that the<br />\nCrown Prince had to prove himself capable of governing by victories in the field.<br />\nEarly in February, 1916, the<br />\nGermans sent out their new Fokker aeroplanes and for a while had<br />\ncontrol of the air.

But this \"Cane<br />\nClub\" is not an old Hopkins tradition, it is a new organization the<br />\n14 founders of which desire that it<br />\nbe continued by succeeding classes<br />\nand therefore are going to take<br />\nJuniors in as well as Seniors. To<br />\nbe eligible an undergraduate must<br />\nalso have done something of note<br />\naround the university. It is an association of good fellows who on<br />\nmeeting days must appear with<br />\ntheir canes, and the rest of the<br />\ntime wear a small emblem on their<br />\nwatch chains.<br />\n<br />\nThe last meeting of the Varsity<br />\nClub was held on Monday, February 7 at the Johns Hopkins Club.<br />\nThough the notices read 8 o'clock<br />\nit was not until nearly 9 o'clock<br />\nthat a quorum arrived and business began. The regular order of<br />\nbusiness was short but very important. Two amendments to the<br />\nconstitution on which had been<br />\nsuggested at the previous meeting<br />\nwere passed upon and unanimously adopted. The first makes undergraduates winning an \"H\" eligible<br />\nfor membership in the club and if<br />\nelected allows them to become<br />\nmembers upon payment of an initiation fee of $2. They will be, however, without the power to vote on<br />\nany matter connected with undergraduate athletics, so that these<br />\nmen will be present at the meetings and will be able to give firsthand information and opinions<br />\nwhich will assist the older members in directing the policy in accord with the undergraduate viewpoint. All undergraduates become<br />\nfull members upon severing their<br />\nconnection with the university<br />\nwithout the payment of further<br />\nfees. The second provides that the<br />\nannual meeting shall be held in<br />\nJune of each year instead of November; accordingly one set of officers and committees will hold office for a whole academic year.<br />\nThis change of date of election prevents an abrupt break in the middle of a season and gives each committee a chance to work out the<br />\nplans that it has formulated.<br />\nFollowing the passage of these<br />\ntwo amendments there was an informal discussion about the prospects in lacrosse and track, especially the Fifth Regiment Armory<br />\nmeet for the coming season.<br />\nMr. Frank LeMott, chairman of<br />\nthe Students' Occupation Committee, reported that he had found<br />\nseveral stores which would permit<br />\nstudents to act as part-time salesmen for them.

Word was sent to Berlin<br />\nthat the fort had fallen and the key<br />\nto Verdun was theirs. They were<br />\nrepulsed, and for the next few<br />\ndays attacked strongly, while the<br />\nFrench sat tight.<br />\nThe railroad situation about<br />\nVerdun was so bad that the splen- \u2022<br />\ndidly prepared motor transport<br />\nsystem of the French was called<br />\ninto play. All roads were closed<br />\nto everything but transport. For<br />\ntwo weeks an endless stream of<br />\ntrucks, which carried thousands of<br />\ntons of ammunition, food and<br />\nthousands of men, was passing to<br />\nthe front. A truck went by a given<br />\npoint every 25 seconds for 15 days.<br />\nGangs of men kept the roads in<br />\nperfect repair, literally replacing<br />\neach stone as it was torn up. By<br />\nthis means the necessary reserves<br />\nwere brought up.<br />\nThe Germans sent a force of<br />\n40,000 men in close formation to<br />\ncapture Vaux. They were wiped<br />\nout by the murderous fire of the<br />\nFrench artillery. Forty thousand<br />\nmore were sent after Dead Man's<br />\nHill. They too were wiped out.<br />\nThree times more similar forces<br />\nwere destroyed in attempts to capture nearby positions, and the German losses ran into hundreds of<br />\nthousands. On April 17 they captured a spur of Dead Man's Hill<br />\nand immediately announced that<br />\nthey had taken the hill itself.<br />\nShortly after this Nivelle replaced Petain. He attacked frequently. On April 24 the Germans<br />\ncounter-attacked. Then the French<br />\ndropped a new form of bomb and<br />\nin 11 minutes were in Vaux. They<br />\nheld the fort gallantly for days,<br />\nthough they were cut off from supplies and had but the scantiest supply of water. Finally on June 7<br />\nthey capitulated. Attack and<br />\ncounter-attack followed until by<br />\nAugust, 1917, the French had regained all ground except that<br />\nwhich the Germans had captured<br />\nin the first 24 hours of the attack.<br />\nThe Battle of Verdun was the<br />\nmost glorious epic of the war, written with the blood of the gallant<br />\nFrenchmen.

For three days a shell was<br />\nfalling every three minutes. Two<br />\nthousand five hundred field guns<br />\nput up a scathing barrage, and at<br />\n12 o'clock, under its cover, the infantry attack began. The French<br />\nleader, General De Castanove, had<br />\nforeseen the plan of the Germans<br />\nand had thinned out his first and<br />\nsecond line trenches, placing his<br />\nreserves in shell-proof dugouts. He<br />\nordered a machine gun barrage,<br />\nthe first to be used in the war, and<br />\nbehind this the French infantry<br />\nmet and repulsed the German attack, and at dusk counter-attacked. It was the sheer individual brilliancy of the French<br />\nsoldier which won the day.<br />\nDuring the night the Germans<br />\nbrought up reserves and many<br />\nmore guns.<br />\nThe next day the<br />\nsame intense struggle went on;<br />\nby night thousands had fallen. On<br />\nthe third day, the twenty-third, the<br />\nGerman sent over wave after wave<br />\nof men, and by sheer mass forced<br />\nthe French to fall back.

After a careful<br />\ncomparison of prices charged at<br />\nthe university store and those<br />\nasked by leading downtown concerns, it is evident that the complaints are unfounded and that<br />\ndowntown figures are as large, and<br />\nin some cases considerably larger<br />\nthan those charged at the university.<br />\nAs concerns stationery, one article for which students considered<br />\nthemselves overcharged was the<br />\nVenus drawing pencil. The price<br />\nof this pencil is 10 cents at the<br />\nuniversity, and nowhere down<br />\ntown, so far as is known, can it be<br />\nobtained for less.

Thus Hopkins students are actually getting their<br />\nPaper cheaper than would be possible elsewhere. The quality of<br />\nthe paper and the size of the packages are the same at all places.<br />\nAs regards the S. P. cardboard<br />\nnotebooks prices vary greatly. The<br />\nsmaller sizes which sell for 55 and<br />\n35 cents at the bookstore are the<br />\nsame down town, but the larger<br />\nsized books can be bought for from<br />\n5 to 10 cents less at one dealers,<br />\nwhile prices at other stores are<br />\nconsiderably higher than bookstore quotations.<br />\nNot one case was found where a<br />\ntext book was less expensive in<br />\ntown than at the university.

He began by<br />\nsaying that he was going to tell of<br />\nthe most glorious episode of the<br />\nwar\u2014the French defense of Verdun, where they proved that they<br />\nwere not merely good fighters only<br />\nwhen they were winning. The battle of Verdun was one of the most<br />\nimportant of the war, economically, politically and in a military<br />\nand dynastic way. The economic<br />\nand military reasons were that the<br />\nFrench were concentrating their<br />\nforces on the line between Paris<br />\nand Verdun, because of the coal<br />\nand iron fields of the Saar. The<br />\nGerman reserves were low, the<br />\nFrench high, but they had deceived<br />\nthe Germans by withholding casThe British forces<br />\nualty lists.<br />\nwere increasing and the Russians<br />\nbeginning to awake. So the Germans decided to attack the French<br />\nline, since it was much the longest<br />\nof the three, and for strategic reasons they picked out Verdun. It<br />\nwas near their fortress of Metz,<br />\nand there was a bulge in the line<br />\nthere in which they thought' to entrap thousands of French: The<br />\ndynastic \u2022 \u2022 reason was that the<br />\nCrown Prince had to prove himself capable of governing by victories in the field.<br />\nEarly in February, 1916, the<br />\nGermans sent out their new Fokker aeroplanes and for a while had<br />\ncontrol of the air.

But this \"Cane<br />\nClub\" is not an old Hopkins tradition, it is a new organization the<br />\n14 founders of which desire that it<br />\nbe continued by succeeding classes<br />\nand therefore are going to take<br />\nJuniors in as well as Seniors. To<br />\nbe eligible an undergraduate must<br />\nalso have done something of note<br />\naround the university. It is an association of good fellows who on<br />\nmeeting days must appear with<br />\ntheir canes, and the rest of the<br />\ntime wear a small emblem on their<br />\nwatch chains.<br /><br />\nThe last meeting of the Varsity<br />\nClub was held on Monday, February 7 at the Johns Hopkins Club.<br />\nThough the notices read 8 o'clock<br />\nit was not until nearly 9 o'clock<br />\nthat a quorum arrived and business began. The regular order of<br />\nbusiness was short but very important. Two amendments to the<br />\nconstitution on which had been<br />\nsuggested at the previous meeting<br />\nwere passed upon and unanimously adopted. The first makes undergraduates winning an \"H\" eligible<br />\nfor membership in the club and if<br />\nelected allows them to become<br />\nmembers upon payment of an initiation fee of $2. They will be, however, without the power to vote on<br />\nany matter connected with undergraduate athletics, so that these<br />\nmen will be present at the meetings and will be able to give firsthand information and opinions<br />\nwhich will assist the older members in directing the policy in accord with the undergraduate viewpoint. All undergraduates become<br />\nfull members upon severing their<br />\nconnection with the university<br />\nwithout the payment of further<br />\nfees. The second provides that the<br />\nannual meeting shall be held in<br />\nJune of each year instead of November; accordingly one set of officers and committees will hold office for a whole academic year.<br />\nThis change of date of election prevents an abrupt break in the middle of a season and gives each committee a chance to work out the<br />\nplans that it has formulated.<br />\nFollowing the passage of these<br />\ntwo amendments there was an informal discussion about the prospects in lacrosse and track, especially the Fifth Regiment Armory<br />\nmeet for the coming season.<br />\nMr. Frank LeMott, chairman of<br />\nthe Students' Occupation Committee, reported that he had found<br />\nseveral stores which would permit<br />\nstudents to act as part-time salesmen for them. Several men who<br />\nare being helped through college<br />\nby the club have already been assigned to these positions.<br />\nThe<br />\nwhole-hearted co-operation of the<br />\nstudent-body is desired in helping<br />\nthese men to work their way<br />\nthrough college.<br />\nInitiation will be held in the<br />\nspring, when a regular old-fashioned \"tap-day\" will take place.<br />\nSuch a day will be long remembered by the man who is notified<br />\nof his election and by the on-looking student-body.<br />\nThe charter members are: Jones,<br />\nKeyes, Lovell, Trew, Cashell,<br />\nWaters, Kennady, Griffiss, Turner,<br />\nWells, Engel, Morgan and Marken.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press<br />\nI.\u2014American Journal of Mathematics.<br />\nF.
