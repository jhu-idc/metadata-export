D\u2022 K.<br />\nTo the eight men who were initiated into Omicron Delta Kappa Honorary Fraternity yesterday we tender<br />\nour most sincere congratulations.<br />\nThese men, four of whom are juniors<br />\nand who will return next fall to form<br />\nthe nucleus of the organization for the<br />\ncoming acamedic term, have obtained<br />\nthe most coveted honor on the campus<br />\nand we hope that they, by their work<br />\nand actions, will keep the fraternity<br />\nof the same high level, that it has<br />\nbeen based on during its years of existence at the Hopkins.<br />\nYou have fought a good fight and<br />\nwon a great victory.<br />\nDr. Swartz's Retirement<br />\nIn June, Dr. Charles K. Swartz, for<br />\nthe past twenty-seven years an instructor in geology, a man respected and<br />\nbeloved by both faculty and student<br />\nbody, is to retire from active duties as<br />\ncollegiate professor at the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIndeed, it will be with a touch of<br />\nregret that we will soon bid farewell<br />\nto this gray-haired gentleman who<br />\nbears no other traces of seventy years<br />\nof active and hard work; that we<br />\nmust, very shortly, lose such an outstanding personality from the faculty.<br />\nYet when the actual day of his retirement approaches it will not be a<br />\nsad occasion, truly, for we will not be<br />\nlosing a very principal man from our<br />\nsocial and educational circles; we will<br />\nnot be weeping over his grave. We<br />\nwill be, on the contrary, really congratulating him upon the triumphant<br />\nresults of his services as a teacher at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins. He has good<br />\nhealth, a virile body and mind. He has<br />\nhosts of friends, a family, and work<br />\nto which he is devoted. He shall have<br />\nthe right to look forward, as we hope<br />\nand expect, to the long enjoyment as<br />\na professor emeritus.<br />\nIndubitably, it is undeniable that<br />\nDr. Swartz has been one of the out-<br />\n<br />\nstanding instructors at the Hopkins<br />\nand that no member of the faculty has<br />\nbeen held in greater esteem and affection by his students than he. One of<br />\nthe most popular and best liked professors at Homewood, he is to leave<br />\nus in less than two months, after having reached the maximum age limitation for the faculty members, to continue his geological investigations and<br />\nand writings in the fields in which he<br />\nis most interested.<br />\nAs seen in the news story elsewhere<br />\nin this paper today, Dr. E. B. Mathews, professor of minerology and<br />\npetrography, highly commends Dr.<br />\nSwartz.

D\u2022 K.<br />\nTo the eight men who were initiated into Omicron Delta Kappa Honorary Fraternity yesterday we tender<br />\nour most sincere congratulations.<br />\nThese men, four of whom are juniors<br />\nand who will return next fall to form<br />\nthe nucleus of the organization for the<br />\ncoming acamedic term, have obtained<br />\nthe most coveted honor on the campus<br />\nand we hope that they, by their work<br />\nand actions, will keep the fraternity<br />\nof the same high level, that it has<br />\nbeen based on during its years of existence at the Hopkins.<br />\nYou have fought a good fight and<br />\nwon a great victory.<br />\nDr. Swartz's Retirement<br />\nIn June, Dr. Charles K. Swartz, for<br />\nthe past twenty-seven years an instructor in geology, a man respected and<br />\nbeloved by both faculty and student<br />\nbody, is to retire from active duties as<br />\ncollegiate professor at the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nIndeed, it will be with a touch of<br />\nregret that we will soon bid farewell<br />\nto this gray-haired gentleman who<br />\nbears no other traces of seventy years<br />\nof active and hard work; that we<br />\nmust, very shortly, lose such an outstanding personality from the faculty.<br />\nYet when the actual day of his retirement approaches it will not be a<br />\nsad occasion, truly, for we will not be<br />\nlosing a very principal man from our<br />\nsocial and educational circles; we will<br />\nnot be weeping over his grave. We<br />\nwill be, on the contrary, really congratulating him upon the triumphant<br />\nresults of his services as a teacher at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins. He has good<br />\nhealth, a virile body and mind. He has<br />\nhosts of friends, a family, and work<br />\nto which he is devoted. He shall have<br />\nthe right to look forward, as we hope<br />\nand expect, to the long enjoyment as<br />\na professor emeritus.<br />\nIndubitably, it is undeniable that<br />\nDr. Swartz has been one of the out-<br /><br />\nstanding instructors at the Hopkins<br />\nand that no member of the faculty has<br />\nbeen held in greater esteem and affection by his students than he. One of<br />\nthe most popular and best liked professors at Homewood, he is to leave<br />\nus in less than two months, after having reached the maximum age limitation for the faculty members, to continue his geological investigations and<br />\nand writings in the fields in which he<br />\nis most interested.<br />\nAs seen in the news story elsewhere<br />\nin this paper today, Dr. E. B. Mathews, professor of minerology and<br />\npetrography, highly commends Dr.<br />\nSwartz. Dr. Mathews even goes so far<br />\nas to declare that it is a difficult task<br />\nto replace him with a man of his equal<br />\nin every respect.,That in itself is a<br />\nhigh commendation from one who<br />\nhas intimately known the retiring collegiate professor throughout his college, university, and teaching careers.<br />\nDevoted to geology and teaching,<br />\nDr. Swartz has proved himself an almost inimitable instructor in that field<br />\nof study at the Hopkins or, perhaps,<br />\nelsewhere. His boyhood desire to become a geology teacher has been happily realized, we believe. As a faculty<br />\nmember he has held an interest in the<br />\nelevation, from all angles, of the University.<br />\nWe sincerely hope that in future<br />\nyears Dr. Swartz will always look<br />\nback upon his work here, following<br />\nhis retirement, as one of the \"firighest<br />\npictures in memory's collection.\"<br />\nRather prematurely, to this \"grand<br />\nold man of the campus\" we wish all<br />\nhappiness and prosperity and hope for<br />\nhis continued interest in the Johns<br />\nHopkins University\u2014her progress,<br />\nher students, her faculty\u2014as he has<br />\nmanifested during his twenty-seven<br />\nyears' services as a splendid teacher,<br />\na worthy friend, a devoted scholar,<br />\nand a gentleman.<br />\nTo the two men who will carry on<br />\nthe work of Dr. Swartz, Dr. Mark<br />\nSecrist and Dr. J.
