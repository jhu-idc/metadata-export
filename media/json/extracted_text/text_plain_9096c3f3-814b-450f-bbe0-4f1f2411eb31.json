He added that the 1240<br />\nday school students with permits<br />\nattempt daily to park in less than<br />\n580 allotted spaces, including 66<br />\nparking meter spaces.<br />\nWalker said, \"The situation is<br />\nso bad, that students and faculty<br />\nmembers arriving on campus<br />\nafter ten o'clock in the morning<br />\n<br />\nare usually forced to park<br />\nillegally.\"<br />\nAccording to Walker, many<br />\nwomen at Hopkins have recently<br />\npreferred not to use the more<br />\ndistant lots, such as the Wyman<br />\nPark Drive area, for safety<br />\nreasons. He said that this had<br />\ncreated a new problem, and now<br />\nhis committee is contending with<br />\nthe undesirability of certain<br />\nspaces along with the lack of<br />\nroom.<br />\nOther problems cited by<br />\nWalker include the illegal use of<br />\nthe lower lots by people from the<br />\nPublic Health Hospital, medical<br />\nstudents who park at Homewood<br />\nand then use the shuttle bus, and<br />\nthe use of faculty parking places<br />\nby relatives.<br />\nWalker could see no single<br />\nsolution to the problem, but<br />\nadded \"Sometimes I ride a<br />\nbicy cle to school; if enough<br />\nstudents were to follow this<br />\ntrend, bicycles could be a<br />\ndefinite answer to the parking<br />\nsituation.\"<br />\n\"Although I agree that the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins money eaters<br />\nparking is not good,\" Walker<br />\nsaid, \"the situation is much<br />\nbetter than at most other<br />\nuniversities.

The University<br />\nwould collect $3 for MaryPIRG along<br />\nwith your tuition. This would then be<br />\nrefundable later in the semester. This<br />\nlimits the economic freedom of those<br />\nwho do not wish to contribute. $3 may<br />\nseem insiginificant, but why shouldn't all<br />\norganizations be allowed to ask for $3 at<br />\nregistration? Then you might have to ask<br />\nfor $100 refund.<br />\nSecond, automatic funding of this type<br />\ncan lead to unresponsiveness. Take our<br />\ndo-little, tuition-funded Student Council<br />\nas an example. If the money were<br />\nrefundable, much funding might be lost.<br />\nBut there will always be a fair share of<br />\nthe student body apathetic, ignorant of,<br />\nor too busy to apply for a refund. Hence,<br />\nan organization grown out-of-touch with<br />\nstudents might continue to draw funding.<br />\nFurthermore, it would be in the interest<br />\no MatyP1RG , despite ptomises to the<br />\nalternative is inc_ solicitation a voluntary<br />\ncontributions. Rather than requiring a<br />\n<br />\nstudent to positively express his<br />\ndispleasure, a true committment of<br />\nsupport would be required. In this<br />\nmanner, the PIRG would be forced to<br />\nremain responsive to the concerns of<br />\nstudents. Other organizations must sell<br />\nthemselves to the public in annual fund<br />\ndrives'; Why not MaryPIRG?<br />\n(Thirdly) Because they claim to<br />\nrepresent The Public Interest. But there is<br />\nno one public interest. Different groups<br />\nand individuals have different interests.<br />\nSuch a group should not sit idle in a case<br />\nof conflicting interests. Indeed,<br />\nMaryPIRG admits it will be a political<br />\nforce, not a non-partisan source of<br />\ninformation. The \"MaryPIRG<br />\nInformation Packet\" states an attempt<br />\nwould be made to \"dissuade<br />\ndecision-makers from a course of action<br />\ncontrary to the public welfare\", advocate<br />\nlegislation, and bring lawsuits. It is not<br />\ninconceivable that many of the positions<br />\ntaken by MaryPIRG may be contrary to<br />\nthe interests of those who forgot to pick<br />\nup their refunds. Let MaryPIRG compete<br />\non an equal basis with other private<br />\ngroups, but do not let them tax us.<br />\nEarl W. Godfrey<br />\nGraduate Student<br />\nDept. of Biology<br />\n<br />\nEducation Department<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOnce again the Newsletter reports that<br />\nplans for Education at Hopkins are nil.<br />\nThis is nothing new, as Dr. Walton can<br />\ntell you, but Dean Suskind's remarks (as<br />\nreported) certainly bear comment.<br />\nHow can the Dean possibly question<br />\nwhether or not there is a \"discipline- of<br />\nEducation when fully 1% of the U.S.<br />\npopulation (including him) is actively<br />\nengaged in that profession? It is hardly<br />\ntrue that there is no discipline: it may be<br />\npoorly defined. Philosophers from Plato<br />\nto Dewey have certainly tried to rectify<br />\nthat situation. Is Education<br />\ninter-disciplinary? Yes, of course, and<br />\nwhat discipline is not? And no one would<br />\nexpect Education to be set up like<br />\nChemistry. Perhaps Philosophy or History<br />\nwould be better guides. But then we<br />\ndon't question the validity of those<br />\n\"disciplines\" so we may not actually<br />\nknow how they are set up anyway.<br />\nThe real issue is whether there is<br />\ndemand for Education at Hopkins,<br />\nparticularly from the underFraduates<br />\nsince they are more likely to want<br />\ncertification. Unfortunately, demand is<br />\nnot considered relevant at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\n(witness Computer Science), but a<br />\npersonal guess is that Education could<br />\ncommand as large an enrollment as<br />\nClassics.<br />\nSo what is the Hopkins solution? A<br />\n\"long-range policy group\" which will<br />\ncertainly be long-range but doubtless will<br />\nnot set policy. Well, I guess that's to be<br />\nexpected. After all, what's to make any<br />\ninstitution of learning concern itself with '<br />\nsuch a trivial, nondescript, probably<br />\ninter-disciplinary and unspecific study<br />\nlike... ughh...\"EDUCATION.\"<br />\nWill Fastie<br />\n<br />\nNixon Corrections<br />\n<br />\nYesterday's announcement of new campus security<br />\nmeasures indicates a welcome willingness on the part<br />\nof the University to take steps toward making<br />\nHomewood a safe place to be. The anti-crime lights,<br />\nthe red security phones and the student patrol service<br />\nare certainly worthwhile innovations. These are all<br />\npractical measures which will surely cut down on the<br />\namount of miscellaneous vandalism, loitering and<br />\nviolent crime here.<br />\nBut decreasing the threat of harm from one source<br />\nwhile increasing it from another hardly makes sense.<br />\nThe student patrol service is dangerous business.<br />\nAlthough these patrolmen will be unarmed, and thus<br />\nimmune to possible harm from their own weapons,<br />\nthey are still being exposed to an immense risk when<br />\nthey are sent out to patrol the campus. When the<br />\nUniversity asks students to be responsible for their<br />\nown protection, the University should realize that it<br />\ncannot be too careful in the selection, training and<br />\nsupport of the students they hire to patrol the campus.<br />\nAssuming Hopkins takes the proper care in starting<br />\nand operating the patrol system, a commendable<br />\nsecurity arrangement will indeed have been<br />\nestablished. But, most important of all, is the fact that<br />\nHopkins will not put up a fence around the campus,<br />\nand retreat to the protection of its ivory tower.<br />\n<br />\nIt's much much more than a dance medium<br />\nBy TOM NATHAN<br />\nFor many the ballet is thought ot<br />\nmerely as a dance medium. But it is much<br />\nmore, complex than that. It requires<br />\nstrong dramatic acting, an appropriate<br />\nand well interpreted musical score, and,<br />\nmost importantly, innovative and<br />\nexpressive choreography.<br />\nBecause good ballet runs such a<br />\ndelicate course, it has always been a<br />\ndifficult medium to convey.

It<br />\nhas no apparent problem integrating<br />\nmodern works such as Alvin Ailey's new<br />\nSea Interludes with classics such as.

COHEN<br />\nA triumphant performance of Mozart's<br />\nConcerto for piano and orchestra in Bb<br />\nmajor redeemed an uneven opening<br />\nconcert of this season's Sunday evening<br />\nShriver Hall Series.<br />\nFeaturing pianist Paul Badura-Skoda,<br />\nand a radically improved chamber<br />\norchestra from the Baltimore Symphony<br />\nunder the direction of Sergiu Comissiona,<br />\nthe all-Mozart program received a very<br />\nwarm reception from the near-capacity<br />\naudience.<br />\nComissiona, over a very brief time, has<br />\ntransformed the Baltimore. Symphony<br />\ninto an orchestra which Baltimore, at<br />\nleast, should be willing to support. His<br />\nchamber orchestra, of about thirty-five<br />\nplayers, represents the best of the<br />\nSymphony, with the potential to perform<br />\ndifficult works with precision and<br />\nintensity, qualities which were apparent<br />\nin spurts during Sunday's performance.<br />\nMore ambitious than prudent<br />\nThe program was more ambitious than<br />\nprudent, opening with a mature<br />\nsymphony, and featuring a concerto<br />\nbefore the intermission, the performance<br />\nconcluding with a serenade for strings and<br />\ntimpani, before the concluding concerto.<br />\nThe symphony, no. 33 in Bb major,<br />\nwas a showpiece for Comissiona's finely<br />\nhoned violin section, to which Mozart<br />\nturned for long pastoral allegro assai, and,<br />\nafter developments through the entire<br />\norchestra. for tense counterpoint, and for<br />\n<br />\nlonger near-serenades. Only in the<br />\nandante was there rich development of<br />\nMozart's subsequent symphonies. Here,<br />\nthough still dominated by the violins, the<br />\norchestra reached great heights, moving<br />\nthrough the registers with precisions,<br />\nfollowing Mozart closely. The andante<br />\nends on a firm note, as the orchestra spins<br />\nthe symphony's themes into a coherent<br />\nstatement.<br />\nThe ensuing minuetto, though not<br />\nwritten for great effect, sounded very<br />\nthin, as the orchestra failed to capture<br />\nany excitement which might have been in<br />\nthe score. The movement ended with the<br />\nrepetition of the symphony's opening<br />\ntheme.<br />\nComissiona drew out of his players a<br />\nrich and precise second allegro assai. The<br />\nmovement again opened inthe violins,<br />\nspreading through the other strings, and<br />\nwas finally taken up by the full orchestra.<br />\nThe violins again became dominant,<br />\nchallenging first the rest of the orchestra<br />\nwith -short punctuations, then playing a<br />\nseries of developments before a rich<br />\nunfolding of the entire orchestra.<br />\nAlso before the intermission,<br />\nBadura-Skoda performed the Concerto in<br />\nA major. The orchestra developed<br />\nrapidly, introducing an extended solo.<br />\nThroughout this concerto, Badura-Skoda<br />\nseemed to play right hand diversion<br />\nwithout a firm control, and with little<br />\ndefinition. Though the concerto's<br />\nnumerous pauses were utilized to effect,<br />\n<br />\nthe overall impression was of a work<br />\npresented without adequate rehearsal.<br />\nFollowing the intermission, the<br />\norchestra, now made up of strings and a<br />\nsingle percussionist, presented an inspired<br />\nSerenade no. 6 in D major, playing a<br />\npotentially incoherent piece with<br />\nrestraint and precision, and, for the only<br />\ntime during the entire concert, with<br />\nconsideration for Mozart's dynamics.<br />\nControlled performance<br />\nReturning for the finale, Badura-Skoda<br />\npresented a controlled performance in the<br />\nBb concerto, one of Mozart's last<br />\nconcerti. The first movement, an allegro,<br />\nbegins with the orchestra developing a<br />\nsweeping passage, interrupted by the<br />\nhorns. Another theme is introduced in<br />\nthe violins, spread through the orchestra,<br />\nintroducing a piano solo of sustained<br />\npower. After the orhcestra's resurgence,<br />\nthe movement ends as the violins fade<br />\nout.<br />\nThe graceful legato began with a<br />\nrestrained piano solo, with the horns<br />\neventually introducing the full orchestra,<br />\nwhich again subsides. Once again, the<br />\npianist showed himself firmly in<br />\ncommand of the music, articulating each<br />\nphrase masterfully.<br />\nThe concluding allegro, much lighter<br />\nthan the previous two movements, was<br />\nlong and repititious, though played<br />\nsuperbly. Fortunately, the coda was brief,<br />\nemphatically ending the piece and the<br />\nconcert on a note of excitement.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/october 31,1972<br />\n<br />\nTalking death at Levering Hall<br />\nBy MITCHEL TENZER<br />\nA discussion of the medical,<br />\npsychological, physiological and<br />\ntheological aspects of death and<br />\ndying was the subject of this<br />\nweek's Sunday Experience in<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThe morning's speakers, Rev.<br />\nClyde R. Shallenberger, Dr.<br />\nRonald W. Marris, and Dr.<br />\nThomas P. Duffy, commented<br />\nbreifly on society's failure to deal<br />\nadequately with the fact of<br />\ndeath.<br />\nThe Rev. Shallenberger, head<br />\nof the chaplaincy services at<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, charged<br />\nthat our society \"treats death as<br />\nunreal.\" \"People don't die\", he<br />\ncontinued, \"they pass away, go<br />\ninto cardiac arrest, or enter their<br />\nheavenly home. The word is<br />\nsimply not used in conversation.\"<br />\nShallenberger also took note<br />\nof the fact that \"we refuse to<br />\nrelate to people in the process of<br />\ndying - we avoid the topic.\" He<br />\nnoted that through society's<br />\n<br />\nrefusal to discuss the fact of<br />\ndeath, \"the person is denied the<br />\nopportunity to be comfortable in<br />\nrelating his own deepest<br />\nfeelings.\" This results in pain,<br />\nloneliness, and a feeling of loss of,<br />\nself.<br />\nDr. Duffy, a hematologist at<br />\nHopkins Hospital, explained that<br />\nin his field he cared for patients<br />\nwhom<br />\nthe great majority of<br />\n\"have illnessess that cause death<br />\nin weeks or months.\" Duffy<br />\nstated his job is to keep the<br />\nfamily educated in terms of the<br />\nprogression of the disease, but<br />\nnot to make them overanxious<br />\n\"so their own fears won't be<br />\noverwhelmed.\"<br />\nDuffy feels that though the<br />\nmodern, sophisticated<br />\n\"mechanical care\" can keep<br />\npeople \"alive\", its use tends to<br />\nforget that \"the patient is a<br />\nhuman being.\" Dr. Marris, who<br />\noffers a course in death and<br />\ndying in the Evening College,<br />\nstated that \"to be fully alive<br />\n<br />\nnecessitates confronting and<br />\nworking through the realization<br />\nthat we are finite...to be truly<br />\nfree we must look death full in<br />\nthe face.\" After doing so, \"we<br />\nmust reorder our priorities and<br />\nreevaluate our lifestyles.\" Marris<br />\nexplained.<br />\n\"There must be a greater<br />\ncollective sensitivity in response<br />\nto death at all levels of life, said<br />\nMarris.

In<br />\naddition, Towson was without its<br />\nregular quarterback and star<br />\nlinebacker, both of whom were<br />\ninjured. But what the Tigers<br />\nlacked in ability, they more than<br />\nmade up for inspiration and<br />\nopportunism.<br />\nFanatics<br />\nBefore a wet but fanatic<br />\nHomecoming crowd at Burdick<br />\nField, the fired up Tigers picked<br />\noff three Jack Thomas aerials and<br />\npounced on two Blue Jay<br />\nfumbles to key the victory. The<br />\nsloppy field conditions stymied<br />\nthe offenses of both teams, but<br />\nTowson managed to come up<br />\nwith the bigger plays, and fully<br />\ndeserved to win.<br />\nThe chief heroes for the Tigers<br />\nwere senior halfback Miek Wells,<br />\nwho rushed for 126 yards rn 30<br />\ncarries and scored two<br />\ntouchdowns, and<br />\nnewly converted linebacker Rick<br />\nDeMilt, who was credited with a<br />\nphenomenal 19 tackles.<br />\nBright Spots<br />\nThe only bright spots in an<br />\notherwise dismal afternoon for<br />\nthe Blue Jays were defensive end<br />\nCraig Stevens, who receovered a<br />\nfumble and intercepted a pass;<br />\nrapidly improving cornerback<br />\nRick Kramer, who also fell on a<br />\nfumble and generally sparkled on<br />\ndefense; and halfback Timmy<br />\nDoyle, who had missed the last<br />\ntwo games due to injuries, but<br />\n<br />\nrecovered enough to gain 71<br />\nyards and account for almost the<br />\nentire Hopkins attack.<br />\nThe game resembled a<br />\nmud-slinging contest for most of<br />\nthe first quarter with neither<br />\nteam mounting much of an<br />\noffense. But with three minutes<br />\nto go, Mike Wells suddenly<br />\nbrought the crowd to its feet by<br />\nsloshing through the quagmire on<br />\na 67-yard return of a Jack<br />\nThomas punt to give the hosts a<br />\n7-0 lead.<br />\nBounce<br />\nThe Jays immediately bounced<br />\nback, launching a 54-yard drive<br />\nin ten plays - most of them runs<br />\nby Doyle - to score the tying<br />\ntouchdown. Thomas sneaked<br />\nover from 2 yards out, and after<br />\nthe Tigers were penalized half the<br />\ndistance to the goal line on the<br />\npoint after touchdown, Doyle<br />\nran for the two point conversion<br />\n-to put Hopkins in front at the<br />\nhalf, 8-7.<br />\nLet Down<br />\nThe advantage was short-lived,<br />\nhowever, because Billy Nolan<br />\nfumbled on the fourth play of<br />\nthe second half, and, Nace<br />\nrecovered for Towson at the<br />\nHopkins 38. The Jays let down<br />\nfor just one play following the<br />\nmiscue, but it was enough to<br />\nallow Wells to romp the 38 yards<br />\nto paydirt. Nace added the extra<br />\npoint and the Tigers had a 14-8<br />\nbulge.<br />\nThe game then developed into<br />\na defensive struggle - most<br />\nattributable perhaps to the<br />\nsloppy, error-prone offenses.<br />\nNeither team could generate an<br />\nattack, nor could they capitalize<br />\non the numerous breaks afforded<br />\nby their opponents.<br />\nThe Blue Jays had one good<br />\nchance to score in the second<br />\nhalf, when Kramer recovered a<br />\nfumble at the Towson 38, but<br />\nThomas fumbled the ball back to<br />\nthe Tigers two plays later, and<br />\nthe comedy of errors continued.<br />\n<br />\neo*eo*e30*ED*(134*e0*(01313*EDLI*630*(D0*(1)111*(Nier(DrI*E1(1)*1 ITC1*(1)0*CD0*())0WrEV-t69*0,130*0\u00ae*p*<br />\n<br />\nWork for<br />\n0.<br />\n<br />\nMcGovern<br />\n<br />\nDEPXDO\"EDO.V.EDEIE)02M E]t DO-tEDOI-EDOEDElctED4-tO(DaV.EDO.V.EDIDEDO g31,0<br />\n<br />\non election day<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nWe need:<br />\nCanvassers \u2014 Phone Callers<br />\n\u2014 Baby Sitters \u2014 Poll Watchers<br />\n\u2014 Drivers<br />\n<br />\nCall (evenings)<br />\n<br />\n,4)<br />\n<br />\nJohn Crofford 243-4866<br />\nJoe Cantor 889-5110<br />\nDave Baron 243-3685<br />\nor sign up at the McGovern desk in<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nIa<br />\n:Marytand-Citizens for McGovein/Shriver, 16 Park.Ave.113aitimore.

He added that the 1240<br />\nday school students with permits<br />\nattempt daily to park in less than<br />\n580 allotted spaces, including 66<br />\nparking meter spaces.<br />\nWalker said, \"The situation is<br />\nso bad, that students and faculty<br />\nmembers arriving on campus<br />\nafter ten o'clock in the morning<br /><br />\nare usually forced to park<br />\nillegally.\"<br />\nAccording to Walker, many<br />\nwomen at Hopkins have recently<br />\npreferred not to use the more<br />\ndistant lots, such as the Wyman<br />\nPark Drive area, for safety<br />\nreasons. He said that this had<br />\ncreated a new problem, and now<br />\nhis committee is contending with<br />\nthe undesirability of certain<br />\nspaces along with the lack of<br />\nroom.<br />\nOther problems cited by<br />\nWalker include the illegal use of<br />\nthe lower lots by people from the<br />\nPublic Health Hospital, medical<br />\nstudents who park at Homewood<br />\nand then use the shuttle bus, and<br />\nthe use of faculty parking places<br />\nby relatives.<br />\nWalker could see no single<br />\nsolution to the problem, but<br />\nadded \"Sometimes I ride a<br />\nbicy cle to school; if enough<br />\nstudents were to follow this<br />\ntrend, bicycles could be a<br />\ndefinite answer to the parking<br />\nsituation.\"<br />\n\"Although I agree that the<br /><br />\nHopkins money eaters<br />\nparking is not good,\" Walker<br />\nsaid, \"the situation is much<br />\nbetter than at most other<br />\nuniversities.

The University<br />\nwould collect $3 for MaryPIRG along<br />\nwith your tuition. This would then be<br />\nrefundable later in the semester. This<br />\nlimits the economic freedom of those<br />\nwho do not wish to contribute. $3 may<br />\nseem insiginificant, but why shouldn't all<br />\norganizations be allowed to ask for $3 at<br />\nregistration? Then you might have to ask<br />\nfor $100 refund.<br />\nSecond, automatic funding of this type<br />\ncan lead to unresponsiveness. Take our<br />\ndo-little, tuition-funded Student Council<br />\nas an example. If the money were<br />\nrefundable, much funding might be lost.<br />\nBut there will always be a fair share of<br />\nthe student body apathetic, ignorant of,<br />\nor too busy to apply for a refund. Hence,<br />\nan organization grown out-of-touch with<br />\nstudents might continue to draw funding.<br />\nFurthermore, it would be in the interest<br />\no MatyP1RG , despite ptomises to the<br />\nalternative is inc_ solicitation a voluntary<br />\ncontributions. Rather than requiring a<br /><br />\nstudent to positively express his<br />\ndispleasure, a true committment of<br />\nsupport would be required. In this<br />\nmanner, the PIRG would be forced to<br />\nremain responsive to the concerns of<br />\nstudents. Other organizations must sell<br />\nthemselves to the public in annual fund<br />\ndrives'; Why not MaryPIRG?<br />\n(Thirdly) Because they claim to<br />\nrepresent The Public Interest. But there is<br />\nno one public interest. Different groups<br />\nand individuals have different interests.<br />\nSuch a group should not sit idle in a case<br />\nof conflicting interests. Indeed,<br />\nMaryPIRG admits it will be a political<br />\nforce, not a non-partisan source of<br />\ninformation. The \"MaryPIRG<br />\nInformation Packet\" states an attempt<br />\nwould be made to \"dissuade<br />\ndecision-makers from a course of action<br />\ncontrary to the public welfare\", advocate<br />\nlegislation, and bring lawsuits. It is not<br />\ninconceivable that many of the positions<br />\ntaken by MaryPIRG may be contrary to<br />\nthe interests of those who forgot to pick<br />\nup their refunds. Let MaryPIRG compete<br />\non an equal basis with other private<br />\ngroups, but do not let them tax us.<br />\nEarl W. Godfrey<br />\nGraduate Student<br />\nDept. of Biology<br /><br />\nEducation Department<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nOnce again the Newsletter reports that<br />\nplans for Education at Hopkins are nil.<br />\nThis is nothing new, as Dr. Walton can<br />\ntell you, but Dean Suskind's remarks (as<br />\nreported) certainly bear comment.<br />\nHow can the Dean possibly question<br />\nwhether or not there is a \"discipline- of<br />\nEducation when fully 1% of the U.S.<br />\npopulation (including him) is actively<br />\nengaged in that profession? It is hardly<br />\ntrue that there is no discipline: it may be<br />\npoorly defined. Philosophers from Plato<br />\nto Dewey have certainly tried to rectify<br />\nthat situation. Is Education<br />\ninter-disciplinary? Yes, of course, and<br />\nwhat discipline is not? And no one would<br />\nexpect Education to be set up like<br />\nChemistry. Perhaps Philosophy or History<br />\nwould be better guides. But then we<br />\ndon't question the validity of those<br />\n\"disciplines\" so we may not actually<br />\nknow how they are set up anyway.<br />\nThe real issue is whether there is<br />\ndemand for Education at Hopkins,<br />\nparticularly from the underFraduates<br />\nsince they are more likely to want<br />\ncertification. Unfortunately, demand is<br />\nnot considered relevant at Hopkins<br /><br />\n(witness Computer Science), but a<br />\npersonal guess is that Education could<br />\ncommand as large an enrollment as<br />\nClassics.<br />\nSo what is the Hopkins solution? A<br />\n\"long-range policy group\" which will<br />\ncertainly be long-range but doubtless will<br />\nnot set policy. Well, I guess that's to be<br />\nexpected. After all, what's to make any<br />\ninstitution of learning concern itself with '<br />\nsuch a trivial, nondescript, probably<br />\ninter-disciplinary and unspecific study<br />\nlike... ughh...\"EDUCATION.\"<br />\nWill Fastie<br /><br />\nNixon Corrections<br /><br />\nYesterday's announcement of new campus security<br />\nmeasures indicates a welcome willingness on the part<br />\nof the University to take steps toward making<br />\nHomewood a safe place to be. The anti-crime lights,<br />\nthe red security phones and the student patrol service<br />\nare certainly worthwhile innovations. These are all<br />\npractical measures which will surely cut down on the<br />\namount of miscellaneous vandalism, loitering and<br />\nviolent crime here.<br />\nBut decreasing the threat of harm from one source<br />\nwhile increasing it from another hardly makes sense.<br />\nThe student patrol service is dangerous business.<br />\nAlthough these patrolmen will be unarmed, and thus<br />\nimmune to possible harm from their own weapons,<br />\nthey are still being exposed to an immense risk when<br />\nthey are sent out to patrol the campus. When the<br />\nUniversity asks students to be responsible for their<br />\nown protection, the University should realize that it<br />\ncannot be too careful in the selection, training and<br />\nsupport of the students they hire to patrol the campus.<br />\nAssuming Hopkins takes the proper care in starting<br />\nand operating the patrol system, a commendable<br />\nsecurity arrangement will indeed have been<br />\nestablished. But, most important of all, is the fact that<br />\nHopkins will not put up a fence around the campus,<br />\nand retreat to the protection of its ivory tower.<br /><br />\nIt's much much more than a dance medium<br />\nBy TOM NATHAN<br />\nFor many the ballet is thought ot<br />\nmerely as a dance medium. But it is much<br />\nmore, complex than that. It requires<br />\nstrong dramatic acting, an appropriate<br />\nand well interpreted musical score, and,<br />\nmost importantly, innovative and<br />\nexpressive choreography.<br />\nBecause good ballet runs such a<br />\ndelicate course, it has always been a<br />\ndifficult medium to convey. If any one of<br />\nits many components is not executed<br />\nproperly, the entire production suffers.<br />\nYet is still the exception rather than the<br />\nrule when all four elements can be united<br />\nsuccessfully performance upon<br />\nperformance.<br /><br />\nThe American Ballet Theatre has been<br />\nable_ to achieve just such a plane. Ballet<br />\nTheatre is the \"official\" company of the<br />\nKennedy Performing Arts Center in<br />\nWashington D.C., but the greater portion<br />\nof its year is spent, not in Washington,<br />\nbut as an international touring ensemble.<br />\nEnsemble might actually be the wrong<br />\nword, since Ballet Theatre's cast numbers<br />\n150 and its repertoire seems limitless. It<br />\nhas no apparent problem integrating<br />\nmodern works such as Alvin Ailey's new<br />\nSea Interludes with classics such as. La<br />\nSpectre de la Rose<br />\nThe latter was originally conceived in<br />\n1911 by Michael Fokine and premiered<br />\nwith Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav<br /><br />\nNijinsky playing the parts of the Young<br />\nGirl and the Spirit of the Rose. Fokine<br />\nlater brought the work to ABT where the<br />\ntreasured roles have been carefully<br />\nhanded, down, much in the manner of a<br />\n_prized family heirloom, and which now<br />\nsees the role danced by Eleanor<br />\nD'Antuonon and Paolo Bortoluzzi.<br />\nBriefly, the plot centers around a<br />\nyoung girl, who upon returning home<br />\nexhausted from her first dance, falls<br />\nasleep and dreams that the rose she was<br />\nwearing comes to life and waltzes with<br />\nher throughout the night. The score is<br />\nWeber's Invitation to the Dance, adding<br />\njust the right amount of charm and<br />\nenchantment to the scene. Bortoluzzi is a<br /><br />\nTo the Editors: I request a few lines to<br />\ncorrect misinformation in Jerry Neser's<br />\narticle \"Nixon finds scant faculty<br />\nsupport\" of October 20.

COHEN<br />\nA triumphant performance of Mozart's<br />\nConcerto for piano and orchestra in Bb<br />\nmajor redeemed an uneven opening<br />\nconcert of this season's Sunday evening<br />\nShriver Hall Series.<br />\nFeaturing pianist Paul Badura-Skoda,<br />\nand a radically improved chamber<br />\norchestra from the Baltimore Symphony<br />\nunder the direction of Sergiu Comissiona,<br />\nthe all-Mozart program received a very<br />\nwarm reception from the near-capacity<br />\naudience.<br />\nComissiona, over a very brief time, has<br />\ntransformed the Baltimore. Symphony<br />\ninto an orchestra which Baltimore, at<br />\nleast, should be willing to support. His<br />\nchamber orchestra, of about thirty-five<br />\nplayers, represents the best of the<br />\nSymphony, with the potential to perform<br />\ndifficult works with precision and<br />\nintensity, qualities which were apparent<br />\nin spurts during Sunday's performance.<br />\nMore ambitious than prudent<br />\nThe program was more ambitious than<br />\nprudent, opening with a mature<br />\nsymphony, and featuring a concerto<br />\nbefore the intermission, the performance<br />\nconcluding with a serenade for strings and<br />\ntimpani, before the concluding concerto.<br />\nThe symphony, no. 33 in Bb major,<br />\nwas a showpiece for Comissiona's finely<br />\nhoned violin section, to which Mozart<br />\nturned for long pastoral allegro assai, and,<br />\nafter developments through the entire<br />\norchestra. for tense counterpoint, and for<br /><br />\nlonger near-serenades. Only in the<br />\nandante was there rich development of<br />\nMozart's subsequent symphonies. Here,<br />\nthough still dominated by the violins, the<br />\norchestra reached great heights, moving<br />\nthrough the registers with precisions,<br />\nfollowing Mozart closely. The andante<br />\nends on a firm note, as the orchestra spins<br />\nthe symphony's themes into a coherent<br />\nstatement.<br />\nThe ensuing minuetto, though not<br />\nwritten for great effect, sounded very<br />\nthin, as the orchestra failed to capture<br />\nany excitement which might have been in<br />\nthe score. The movement ended with the<br />\nrepetition of the symphony's opening<br />\ntheme.<br />\nComissiona drew out of his players a<br />\nrich and precise second allegro assai. The<br />\nmovement again opened inthe violins,<br />\nspreading through the other strings, and<br />\nwas finally taken up by the full orchestra.<br />\nThe violins again became dominant,<br />\nchallenging first the rest of the orchestra<br />\nwith -short punctuations, then playing a<br />\nseries of developments before a rich<br />\nunfolding of the entire orchestra.<br />\nAlso before the intermission,<br />\nBadura-Skoda performed the Concerto in<br />\nA major. The orchestra developed<br />\nrapidly, introducing an extended solo.<br />\nThroughout this concerto, Badura-Skoda<br />\nseemed to play right hand diversion<br />\nwithout a firm control, and with little<br />\ndefinition. Though the concerto's<br />\nnumerous pauses were utilized to effect,<br /><br />\nthe overall impression was of a work<br />\npresented without adequate rehearsal.<br />\nFollowing the intermission, the<br />\norchestra, now made up of strings and a<br />\nsingle percussionist, presented an inspired<br />\nSerenade no. 6 in D major, playing a<br />\npotentially incoherent piece with<br />\nrestraint and precision, and, for the only<br />\ntime during the entire concert, with<br />\nconsideration for Mozart's dynamics.<br />\nControlled performance<br />\nReturning for the finale, Badura-Skoda<br />\npresented a controlled performance in the<br />\nBb concerto, one of Mozart's last<br />\nconcerti. The first movement, an allegro,<br />\nbegins with the orchestra developing a<br />\nsweeping passage, interrupted by the<br />\nhorns. Another theme is introduced in<br />\nthe violins, spread through the orchestra,<br />\nintroducing a piano solo of sustained<br />\npower. After the orhcestra's resurgence,<br />\nthe movement ends as the violins fade<br />\nout.<br />\nThe graceful legato began with a<br />\nrestrained piano solo, with the horns<br />\neventually introducing the full orchestra,<br />\nwhich again subsides. Once again, the<br />\npianist showed himself firmly in<br />\ncommand of the music, articulating each<br />\nphrase masterfully.<br />\nThe concluding allegro, much lighter<br />\nthan the previous two movements, was<br />\nlong and repititious, though played<br />\nsuperbly. Fortunately, the coda was brief,<br />\nemphatically ending the piece and the<br />\nconcert on a note of excitement.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letter/october 31,1972<br /><br />\nTalking death at Levering Hall<br />\nBy MITCHEL TENZER<br />\nA discussion of the medical,<br />\npsychological, physiological and<br />\ntheological aspects of death and<br />\ndying was the subject of this<br />\nweek's Sunday Experience in<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nThe morning's speakers, Rev.<br />\nClyde R.

Shallenberger, head<br />\nof the chaplaincy services at<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital, charged<br />\nthat our society \"treats death as<br />\nunreal.\" \"People don't die\", he<br />\ncontinued, \"they pass away, go<br />\ninto cardiac arrest, or enter their<br />\nheavenly home. The word is<br />\nsimply not used in conversation.\"<br />\nShallenberger also took note<br />\nof the fact that \"we refuse to<br />\nrelate to people in the process of<br />\ndying - we avoid the topic.\" He<br />\nnoted that through society's<br /><br />\nrefusal to discuss the fact of<br />\ndeath, \"the person is denied the<br />\nopportunity to be comfortable in<br />\nrelating his own deepest<br />\nfeelings.\" This results in pain,<br />\nloneliness, and a feeling of loss of,<br />\nself.<br />\nDr. Duffy, a hematologist at<br />\nHopkins Hospital, explained that<br />\nin his field he cared for patients<br />\nwhom<br />\nthe great majority of<br />\n\"have illnessess that cause death<br />\nin weeks or months.\" Duffy<br />\nstated his job is to keep the<br />\nfamily educated in terms of the<br />\nprogression of the disease, but<br />\nnot to make them overanxious<br />\n\"so their own fears won't be<br />\noverwhelmed.\"<br />\nDuffy feels that though the<br />\nmodern, sophisticated<br />\n\"mechanical care\" can keep<br />\npeople \"alive\", its use tends to<br />\nforget that \"the patient is a<br />\nhuman being.\" Dr. Marris, who<br />\noffers a course in death and<br />\ndying in the Evening College,<br />\nstated that \"to be fully alive<br /><br />\nnecessitates confronting and<br />\nworking through the realization<br />\nthat we are finite...to be truly<br />\nfree we must look death full in<br />\nthe face.\" After doing so, \"we<br />\nmust reorder our priorities and<br />\nreevaluate our lifestyles.\" Marris<br />\nexplained.<br />\n\"There must be a greater<br />\ncollective sensitivity in response<br />\nto death at all levels of life, said<br />\nMarris.

In<br />\naddition, Towson was without its<br />\nregular quarterback and star<br />\nlinebacker, both of whom were<br />\ninjured. But what the Tigers<br />\nlacked in ability, they more than<br />\nmade up for inspiration and<br />\nopportunism.<br />\nFanatics<br />\nBefore a wet but fanatic<br />\nHomecoming crowd at Burdick<br />\nField, the fired up Tigers picked<br />\noff three Jack Thomas aerials and<br />\npounced on two Blue Jay<br />\nfumbles to key the victory. The<br />\nsloppy field conditions stymied<br />\nthe offenses of both teams, but<br />\nTowson managed to come up<br />\nwith the bigger plays, and fully<br />\ndeserved to win.<br />\nThe chief heroes for the Tigers<br />\nwere senior halfback Miek Wells,<br />\nwho rushed for 126 yards rn 30<br />\ncarries and scored two<br />\ntouchdowns, and<br />\nnewly converted linebacker Rick<br />\nDeMilt, who was credited with a<br />\nphenomenal 19 tackles.<br />\nBright Spots<br />\nThe only bright spots in an<br />\notherwise dismal afternoon for<br />\nthe Blue Jays were defensive end<br />\nCraig Stevens, who receovered a<br />\nfumble and intercepted a pass;<br />\nrapidly improving cornerback<br />\nRick Kramer, who also fell on a<br />\nfumble and generally sparkled on<br />\ndefense; and halfback Timmy<br />\nDoyle, who had missed the last<br />\ntwo games due to injuries, but<br /><br />\nrecovered enough to gain 71<br />\nyards and account for almost the<br />\nentire Hopkins attack.<br />\nThe game resembled a<br />\nmud-slinging contest for most of<br />\nthe first quarter with neither<br />\nteam mounting much of an<br />\noffense. But with three minutes<br />\nto go, Mike Wells suddenly<br />\nbrought the crowd to its feet by<br />\nsloshing through the quagmire on<br />\na 67-yard return of a Jack<br />\nThomas punt to give the hosts a<br />\n7-0 lead.<br />\nBounce<br />\nThe Jays immediately bounced<br />\nback, launching a 54-yard drive<br />\nin ten plays - most of them runs<br />\nby Doyle - to score the tying<br />\ntouchdown. Thomas sneaked<br />\nover from 2 yards out, and after<br />\nthe Tigers were penalized half the<br />\ndistance to the goal line on the<br />\npoint after touchdown, Doyle<br />\nran for the two point conversion<br />\n-to put Hopkins in front at the<br />\nhalf, 8-7.<br />\nLet Down<br />\nThe advantage was short-lived,<br />\nhowever, because Billy Nolan<br />\nfumbled on the fourth play of<br />\nthe second half, and, Nace<br />\nrecovered for Towson at the<br />\nHopkins 38. The Jays let down<br />\nfor just one play following the<br />\nmiscue, but it was enough to<br />\nallow Wells to romp the 38 yards<br />\nto paydirt. Nace added the extra<br />\npoint and the Tigers had a 14-8<br />\nbulge.<br />\nThe game then developed into<br />\na defensive struggle - most<br />\nattributable perhaps to the<br />\nsloppy, error-prone offenses.<br />\nNeither team could generate an<br />\nattack, nor could they capitalize<br />\non the numerous breaks afforded<br />\nby their opponents.<br />\nThe Blue Jays had one good<br />\nchance to score in the second<br />\nhalf, when Kramer recovered a<br />\nfumble at the Towson 38, but<br />\nThomas fumbled the ball back to<br />\nthe Tigers two plays later, and<br />\nthe comedy of errors continued.<br /><br />\neo*eo*e30*ED*(134*e0*(01313*EDLI*630*(D0*(1)111*(Nier(DrI*E1(1)*1 ITC1*(1)0*CD0*())0WrEV-t69*0,130*0\u00ae*p*<br /><br />\nWork for<br />\n0.<br /><br />\nMcGovern<br /><br />\nDEPXDO\"EDO.V.EDEIE)02M E]t DO-tEDOI-EDOEDElctED4-tO(DaV.EDO.V.EDIDEDO g31,0<br /><br />\non election day<br />\n0<br /><br />\nWe need:<br />\nCanvassers \u2014 Phone Callers<br />\n\u2014 Baby Sitters \u2014 Poll Watchers<br />\n\u2014 Drivers<br /><br />\nCall (evenings)<br /><br />\n,4)<br /><br />\nJohn Crofford 243-4866<br />\nJoe Cantor 889-5110<br />\nDave Baron 243-3685<br />\nor sign up at the McGovern desk in<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nIa<br />\n:Marytand-Citizens for McGovein/Shriver, 16 Park.Ave.113aitimore.
