While he was in<br />\nEgypt, England lifted her suzerainty, thus making Egypt entire<br />\nsovereign. Before this time it was<br />\nimpossible for anyone to determine the political status of Egypt.<br />\ndeclared<br />\nEngland<br />\nthat<br />\nshe<br />\n(Egypt) was sovereign with the<br />\nexception of certain restrictions<br />\nwhich would eventually be removed. These resstrictions were<br />\nremoved while Dr. Willoughby<br />\nwas in Egypt and England has<br />\nnow only the rights of protecting<br />\nthe Suez Canal and foreign business in the land of the pyramids.<br />\nPolitical Interest in India<br />\n<br />\nIn India, according to Dr. Willoughby, the English government<br />\nis making an honest attempt to<br />\nslowly introduce responsible government. This is being done with<br />\nthe ultimate of British control<br />\nidentical with that of the Other dominions of Canada, Australia,<br />\nSouth Africa and Ireland. Many<br />\nof the Indians insist that the progress toward Indian autonomy is<br />\ntoo slow and should be more rapid.<br />\nThere is, therefore, a great deal of<br />\ndiscontent which makes England's<br />\ntask of introducing responsible<br />\ngovernment much more difficult.<br />\nPROF. PELLIOT TO LECTURE<br />\nON ARCHAEOLOGY<br />\nProfessor Paul Pelliot, of the<br />\nchair of Chinese Civilization in the<br />\nCollege of France, will deliver four<br />\nlectures, open to the public, in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Hall on February<br />\nthe fifth seventh twelfth and fourteenth, at.5 P. M. Professor Pelliot will lecture on the subject of<br />\nhis archaeological work in Chinese<br />\nTurkestan, where many ancient<br />\nmanuscripts, covered and preserved<br />\nby the invading desert, have been<br />\nreclaimed. The field chosen by Professor Pelliot for his archaeological<br />\nresearch rivals Egypt in its abundance of ancient records, so at this<br />\ntime when Central Asia is assuming archaeological importance, the<br />\narchaeologist's message should be<br />\nintensely interesting.<br />\n<br />\nWhat<br />\nEngineering<br />\nOwes To<br />\nSound<br />\nPrinciples<br />\nDERITAPS no phase of electrical development is more<br />\nfascinating than the events<br />\nleading up to the practical use of electricity as the motive power for street<br />\nrailway transportation.<br />\nIt is a story of \"midnight oil\", hard thinking, extreme perseverance. No better example of the value<br />\nof sound principles to present day engineering could<br />\nbe cited than the Westinghouse No. 3 Motor, as introduced in 1891.<br />\nIts design was so fundamentally correct and the<br />\ndetails were so soundly worked out that subsequent<br />\ndevelopments of railway motors all followed the principles embodied in it. Now let's see what bearing this<br />\nhas had on modern transportation.<br />\nIn 1700 the first permanently fixed rails made their<br />\nappearance. In 1831, in New York, horse cars began<br />\noperation. In 1834, after fruitless attempts to apply<br />\nsteam, compressed air, gas, etc., to these cars, a<br />\nVermont blacksmith, one Thomas Davenport, sug-<br />\n<br />\nWestinghouse Motor, No. 3, the Progenitor of the<br />\nPresent Universally-Adopted D.C. Railway Motor.<br />\n<br />\ngested that electricity be used as the motive power.<br />\nThe very first practical commercial dynamo,built by<br />\nGramme, in 1862, made this suggestion a possibility.<br />\nIt was natural that George Westinghouse, with his<br />\nintense interest in transportation, should take up this<br />\nproblem. From 1889 to 1891, he, with his organization, worked continuously to perfect a commercially<br />\npracticable railway motor, and the famous No. 3,<br />\ndaddy of all street railway motors, was the result.<br />\nAs mentioned before,the principles embodied in the<br />\nNo.3, thirty-two years ago,are still in use, and at least<br />\nten prominent features of this remarkable motor are<br />\nto be found in present-day types.

Gildersleeve much has been said<br />\nabout the poetry of the departed Greek scholar. Little of his verse<br />\nfound its way to print, but in the last years of his life Dr. Gildersleeve overcame his reluctance to have his verses published and occasionally a local newspaper or a scholar's magazine was fortunate<br />\nenough to obtain permission to print some of \"the last Greek's\" lilting lines. The best known of these, and one of the latest was the<br />\nsonnet on his eighty-eighth birthday. The sonnet was written in 1919,<br />\nfour years before the master's death.<br />\n\"My eyes are dim from age and dull my ears;<br />\nAnd I am left alone to meditate<br />\nUpon the riddles of our mortal state,<br />\nToo sad for laughter, and too deep for tears.<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\nO one smokes<br />\nMelachrinos<br />\nwithout liking them<br />\n\u2014for their quality<br />\ninstantly wins appreciation.<br />\n<br />\nN<br />\n<br />\n\"The wane of intellect, and the weight of years,<br />\nSaid one who knew,'you cannot separate,'<br />\nShall I say yea to this at eighty-eight?<br />\nFor truth is truth, what if it irks, not cheers?<br />\n\"No answer to the question can I find,<br />\nNor will I list to friendship's glowing lips,<br />\nWhich can tell me I am now just what I.was.<br />\nThis constant watching for the wane of mind<br />\nIs it not better than the drear eclipse<br />\nWhen senile meanderin,gs pass for Solon's laws?\"<br />\n<br />\nNeatly combed, well-kept hair is a<br />\nbusiness and social asset.<br />\nSTACOMB makes the hair stay combed<br />\nin any style you like even after it has<br />\njust been washed.<br />\nSTACOMB\u2014the original\u2014has been<br />\nused for years by stars of stage and<br />\nscreen\u2014leaders of style.

Dr. Gildersleeve did not stop writing, however, until just<br />\nbefore his death in his ninety-third year. On November 24 last Dr.<br />\nGildersleeve's old friend and companion in arms, Mr. Joseph Packard died and Dr. Gildersleeve wrote the following verse in his honor:<br />\n\"The heart knows its own bitterness, 'tis said<br />\nIts inliest joys no stranger ever knows:<br />\nBut from one source the stream of sorrow flows,<br />\nAnd there's one voice for the mourning of the dead.<br />\nWe weep for those of whom we've only read,<br />\nMourners and mourned may long have found repose,<br />\nAnd yet our hearts are deeply stirred for those<br />\nWho in their day would not be comforted.<br />\nAnd so, dear friend of more than fifty years,<br />\nNoble exemplar of a noble age,<br />\nMy tears for thee call forth another's tears<br />\nFrom the sealed fountain of an old Greek page<br />\nThe sorrows of the world encompass me,<br />\nThe plangent music of griefs sad, salt sea.\"<br />\n<br />\nAddress<br />\n<br />\nsid<br />\nun<br />\n<br />\nilie<br />\n<br />\nHub<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore's Great<br />\nMen's Store<br />\n<br />\nRE<br />\ncol<br />\n<br />\nBc<br />\non<br />\nab<br />\nwi<br />\n<br />\nsoi<br />\n<br />\nN(<br />\nrni<br />\n<br />\nbe<br />\nthc<br />\nPiz<br />\notl<br />\n<br />\nco.<br />\n<br />\nN(<br />\naci<br />\npe<br />\n<br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\n411 Besides the reputation of an old-established firm<br />\nis back of each sale with a guarantee.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN C.

Before this time it was<br />\nimpossible for anyone to determine the political status of Egypt.<br />\ndeclared<br />\nEngland<br />\nthat<br />\nshe<br />\n(Egypt) was sovereign with the<br />\nexception of certain restrictions<br />\nwhich would eventually be removed. These resstrictions were<br />\nremoved while Dr. Willoughby<br />\nwas in Egypt and England has<br />\nnow only the rights of protecting<br />\nthe Suez Canal and foreign business in the land of the pyramids.<br />\nPolitical Interest in India<br /><br />\nIn India, according to Dr. Willoughby, the English government<br />\nis making an honest attempt to<br />\nslowly introduce responsible government. This is being done with<br />\nthe ultimate of British control<br />\nidentical with that of the Other dominions of Canada, Australia,<br />\nSouth Africa and Ireland. Many<br />\nof the Indians insist that the progress toward Indian autonomy is<br />\ntoo slow and should be more rapid.<br />\nThere is, therefore, a great deal of<br />\ndiscontent which makes England's<br />\ntask of introducing responsible<br />\ngovernment much more difficult.<br />\nPROF. PELLIOT TO LECTURE<br />\nON ARCHAEOLOGY<br />\nProfessor Paul Pelliot, of the<br />\nchair of Chinese Civilization in the<br />\nCollege of France, will deliver four<br />\nlectures, open to the public, in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Hall on February<br />\nthe fifth seventh twelfth and fourteenth, at.5 P. M. Professor Pelliot will lecture on the subject of<br />\nhis archaeological work in Chinese<br />\nTurkestan, where many ancient<br />\nmanuscripts, covered and preserved<br />\nby the invading desert, have been<br />\nreclaimed. The field chosen by Professor Pelliot for his archaeological<br />\nresearch rivals Egypt in its abundance of ancient records, so at this<br />\ntime when Central Asia is assuming archaeological importance, the<br />\narchaeologist's message should be<br />\nintensely interesting.<br /><br />\nWhat<br />\nEngineering<br />\nOwes To<br />\nSound<br />\nPrinciples<br />\nDERITAPS no phase of electrical development is more<br />\nfascinating than the events<br />\nleading up to the practical use of electricity as the motive power for street<br />\nrailway transportation.<br />\nIt is a story of \"midnight oil\", hard thinking, extreme perseverance. No better example of the value<br />\nof sound principles to present day engineering could<br />\nbe cited than the Westinghouse No. 3 Motor, as introduced in 1891.<br />\nIts design was so fundamentally correct and the<br />\ndetails were so soundly worked out that subsequent<br />\ndevelopments of railway motors all followed the principles embodied in it. Now let's see what bearing this<br />\nhas had on modern transportation.<br />\nIn 1700 the first permanently fixed rails made their<br />\nappearance. In 1831, in New York, horse cars began<br />\noperation. In 1834, after fruitless attempts to apply<br />\nsteam, compressed air, gas, etc., to these cars, a<br />\nVermont blacksmith, one Thomas Davenport, sug-<br /><br />\nWestinghouse Motor, No. 3, the Progenitor of the<br />\nPresent Universally-Adopted D.C. Railway Motor.<br /><br />\ngested that electricity be used as the motive power.<br />\nThe very first practical commercial dynamo,built by<br />\nGramme, in 1862, made this suggestion a possibility.<br />\nIt was natural that George Westinghouse, with his<br />\nintense interest in transportation, should take up this<br />\nproblem. From 1889 to 1891, he, with his organization, worked continuously to perfect a commercially<br />\npracticable railway motor, and the famous No. 3,<br />\ndaddy of all street railway motors, was the result.<br />\nAs mentioned before,the principles embodied in the<br />\nNo.3, thirty-two years ago,are still in use, and at least<br />\nten prominent features of this remarkable motor are<br />\nto be found in present-day types. A number of these<br />\nearly motors are still in operation\u2014a tribute to sound<br /><br />\nengineering principles.<br /><br />\nWestinghouse<br />\nACHIEVEMENT 0 OPPORTUNITY<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, JANUARY 22, 1924<br />\nNEWS-LETTER REPRODUCES TWO OF DR.

Gildersleeve much has been said<br />\nabout the poetry of the departed Greek scholar. Little of his verse<br />\nfound its way to print, but in the last years of his life Dr. Gildersleeve overcame his reluctance to have his verses published and occasionally a local newspaper or a scholar's magazine was fortunate<br />\nenough to obtain permission to print some of \"the last Greek's\" lilting lines. The best known of these, and one of the latest was the<br />\nsonnet on his eighty-eighth birthday. The sonnet was written in 1919,<br />\nfour years before the master's death.<br />\n\"My eyes are dim from age and dull my ears;<br />\nAnd I am left alone to meditate<br />\nUpon the riddles of our mortal state,<br />\nToo sad for laughter, and too deep for tears.<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\nO one smokes<br />\nMelachrinos<br />\nwithout liking them<br />\n\u2014for their quality<br />\ninstantly wins appreciation.<br /><br />\nN<br /><br />\n\"The wane of intellect, and the weight of years,<br />\nSaid one who knew,'you cannot separate,'<br />\nShall I say yea to this at eighty-eight?<br />\nFor truth is truth, what if it irks, not cheers?<br />\n\"No answer to the question can I find,<br />\nNor will I list to friendship's glowing lips,<br />\nWhich can tell me I am now just what I.was.<br />\nThis constant watching for the wane of mind<br />\nIs it not better than the drear eclipse<br />\nWhen senile meanderin,gs pass for Solon's laws?\"<br /><br />\nNeatly combed, well-kept hair is a<br />\nbusiness and social asset.<br />\nSTACOMB makes the hair stay combed<br />\nin any style you like even after it has<br />\njust been washed.<br />\nSTACOMB\u2014the original\u2014has been<br />\nused for years by stars of stage and<br />\nscreen\u2014leaders of style.

Dr. Gildersleeve did not stop writing, however, until just<br />\nbefore his death in his ninety-third year. On November 24 last Dr.<br />\nGildersleeve's old friend and companion in arms, Mr. Joseph Packard died and Dr. Gildersleeve wrote the following verse in his honor:<br />\n\"The heart knows its own bitterness, 'tis said<br />\nIts inliest joys no stranger ever knows:<br />\nBut from one source the stream of sorrow flows,<br />\nAnd there's one voice for the mourning of the dead.<br />\nWe weep for those of whom we've only read,<br />\nMourners and mourned may long have found repose,<br />\nAnd yet our hearts are deeply stirred for those<br />\nWho in their day would not be comforted.<br />\nAnd so, dear friend of more than fifty years,<br />\nNoble exemplar of a noble age,<br />\nMy tears for thee call forth another's tears<br />\nFrom the sealed fountain of an old Greek page<br />\nThe sorrows of the world encompass me,<br />\nThe plangent music of griefs sad, salt sea.\"<br /><br />\nAddress<br /><br />\nsid<br />\nun<br /><br />\nilie<br /><br />\nHub<br /><br />\nBaltimore's Great<br />\nMen's Store<br /><br />\nRE<br />\ncol<br /><br />\nBc<br />\non<br />\nab<br />\nwi<br /><br />\nsoi<br /><br />\nN(<br />\nrni<br /><br />\nbe<br />\nthc<br />\nPiz<br />\notl<br /><br />\nco.<br /><br />\nN(<br />\naci<br />\npe<br /><br />\nFURNITURE OF QUALITY<br />\nand individuality is offered here at prices that are not<br />\nand cannot be underquoted by any house at any time.<br />\n411 Besides the reputation of an old-established firm<br />\nis back of each sale with a guarantee.<br /><br />\nJOHN C.
