A more cohesive and or-<br />\n<br />\nganized staff, he said, has been a<br />\nmain reason for the success of<br />\nthis year's housemaster program.<br />\n\"We've done some good things<br />\nthis year in relation to the housemaster program. The job, itself, is<br />\na lot of work and fun. You meet<br />\nlots of people.\"(<br />\n\"This year there's been more<br />\nunity among housemasters.

Between six and ten members will take part in this presentation, which will be given sometime in April at the Cross Keys<br />\nInn. In addition, the debate will<br />\nbe presented on campus during<br />\nthe Spring Fair.<br />\nCostumes for this occasion are<br />\ncurrently being sought by the<br />\n<br />\nEd Brokans<br />\n<br />\ncision making process,\" stated<br />\nWolf.<br />\nAnother reason cited for the<br />\nrise in housemaster applications<br />\nhas been the economic benefits<br />\nof the job.

True to Savitz's claim, the Council has reached a level<br />\nof efficiency such that students are \"coming up through and<br />\nunder the auspices of the SC.\" This situation\u2014in addition to<br />\nmaking for an effective Council\u2014insures a succession of qualified leadership.<br />\nHowever, while the SC has earned an unquestioned degree<br />\nof respect in the Hopkins community in the past several<br />\nyears, much of the Council's unity and strength has been<br />\ndependant upon Savitz's own personal savvy and persistence.<br />\nThus much of the Council's efficacy as a body has depended<br />\nupon the force of one of its members.<br />\nWith a new President, the Council may have initial troubles<br />\ngetting on its feet after such a long and imperious stewardship. However, the fresh leadership may allow for a more<br />\nopen and participatory attitude in decision-making than has<br />\nexisted under Savitz. The best way to launch the new Council<br />\noff to a good start is for undergraduates to vote and demonstrate their faith in the SC\u2014whence, of course, the Council<br />\nderives most of its power.<br />\n<br />\nBy DAVID COPELAND<br />\nMost of you know that Joseph<br />\nHeller came to Baltimore Thursday<br />\nand spoke at Shriver Hall. You<br />\nmay also know that his speech was<br />\na part of the Milford H. Whitehill<br />\nLecture Series, sponsored by ODK,<br />\nthe leadership fraternity of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBut when Joseph Heller spoke<br />\nThursday, it was more than another lecture in the Whitehill Series.<br />\nThe Whitehill Series consists of lectures by recognized leaders of several fields. Yet Joseph Heller's<br />\nspeech marked the recognition by<br />\nODK that not all leaders are political. For the past several years, only<br />\npolitical leaders have spoken at the<br />\nWhitehill lectures. The ODK<br />\nshould not be faulted for this pattern. This thinking behind it is merely indicative of this country's<br />\nstilted perspective. One hundred<br />\nyears hence, Senator Mondale may<br />\nbe forgotten. Joseph Heller will remain an outstanding figure of this<br />\nera.<br />\nJoseph Heller is a leader in his<br />\nfield, yet he is atypical of that<br />\nfield. Fiction-writing in this country was only recently dominated<br />\nby John O'Hara, who never rewrote a line. Joseph Heller rewrites<br />\n<br />\nmore extensively (and more \"compulsively\" and \"neurotically,\" to<br />\nuse his own words) than any writer<br />\nin recent memory. He spent nine<br />\nyears writing Catch-22 and thirteen<br />\non Something Happened, his current novel. His concentration on a<br />\ngiven project is so total, that during those thirteen years, with the<br />\nsole exception of his play We Bombed in New Haven, he wrote<br />\nnothing else.<br />\nHeller pays perhaps more attention to the precision of his art than<br />\nany of his contemporaries, yet he<br />\nrebukes any attempt to have himself cast in the mold of the standard-bearer of great literature. In a<br />\nbrief, brilliant introduction to<br />\nJoseph Heller's speech, John Barth<br />\ncompared Heller's writing practices<br />\nto Homers's likening Catch-22 to<br />\nThe Iliad, and Something Happened to The Odyssey. He continued<br />\nby suggesting that Heller had adhered to Horace's credo of letting a<br />\nmanuscript mature for a long time.<br />\nYet, Barth was less than serious.<br />\nThe intent behind his humor was<br />\nto demonstrate that intense dedication which Heller gives to his craft.<br />\nEven at this whimsical compliment, Heller seemed to cringe. \"I<br />\ndon't know who Horace is,\" he<br />\n<br />\nsaid, and the audience laughed.<br />\n\"Homer I've heard of. And The<br />\nIliad I've heard of. But the comparisons are not only confusing but<br />\nembarrassing.\"<br />\nWhen Joseph Heller created Bob<br />\nSlocum, the protagonist of Something Happened, he went from the<br />\natypical to the revolutionary. Slocum is under fifty,. an executive,<br />\nwith a wife and three children, the<br />\nyoungest of whom is retarded. His<br />\nlife is monotonous. He is in many<br />\nways a despicable human being. He<br />\nfeels no love, only shame and resentment, towards his retarded<br />\nson. Bob Slocum cannot even<br />\nclaim for himself the comfort of<br />\nthe anti-hero. He is one of the<br />\nmost unlikely protagonists ever to<br />\nappear in fiction.<br />\nThe plot and the writing of<br />\nSomething Happened are deliberately monotonous. Nothing ever happens to Slocum, except once. Such<br />\nis his existence. Yet the sheer brilliance of the writing continually<br />\nimpresses the reader, as it did the<br />\naudience at Shriver Hall, who listened to Heller read from the novel.<br />\nWhat Joseph Heller did in Something Happened supposedly cannot<br />\nbe done. He went against every<br />\n<br />\nFraternities and rush: is college sickness gone?<br />\nBy MATT LASKOWSKI<br />\nOfficially rush is over, but its ramifications will manifest themselves throughout the remainder of<br />\nthe academic year. Maybe. Fraternities certainly aren't an omnipotent force on this campus(they vie<br />\nwith the Student Council for the<br />\nright to claim \"minimum effectiveness with a maximum of exposure\").

This is the essence of that ultra -coin p etitive, pre-professionalism which has been so much discussed here. Unless this attitude is<br />\ndiscarded, it will be in vaid to attempt to curtail cheating.<br />\nYour editorial in last Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter expressed valuable<br />\nprinciples but offered no means for<br />\ntheir realization. Perhaps a proctoring system would make students<br />\nwho cheat more aware that those<br />\nwho don't display honor do not<br />\ndeserve to have honor entrusted to<br />\nthem, and this could be step toward an honor system that works<br />\nbeing instituted when appropriate.<br />\nIn the meantime, it would seem<br />\nuseless to continue in the atmosphere that now exists, vainly<br />\nhoping that students will \"learn to<br />\nwork honestly.\"<br />\nMichael Bellow<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to dispute the growing sentiment that the Honor Code<br />\nis obsolete and ought to be abolished. Though there may be many<br />\npeople attending this institution<br />\nwho are unworthy, this problem<br />\nwill not be ameliorated by proctored exams. Cheaters may gain some<br />\ntemporary illusory advantage, however they will not escape some<br />\nform of retribution. The spiritual<br />\nmalignancy (substitute neurosis if<br />\nyou will) which is at the root of<br />\ncheating will eventually be their<br />\nundoing. I'm not necessarily evoking Karma here, there are more<br />\nmundane things such as ulcers., nervous breakdowns, and impotency<br />\nwhich can claim them.<br />\nFew would deny that honor is a<br />\nworthy ideal. In my opinion as ideal should be rejected when it is<br />\nfound to lack virtue, not because it<br />\nis not adhered to by a minority (or<br />\nmajority). I believe there are many<br />\nstudents at Hopkins who would<br />\nfeel affronted by the imposition of<br />\nproctored exams. We would be<br />\nproud to graduate from a University which upheld the Honor Code.<br />\nScott R. Reichard<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nwould like to take this opportut ity to object to the assertion<br />\ntha t Mark Horning does not deserye the title of Athlete of the Week<br />\n<br />\nNipmfromo,<br />\n<br />\nhaps I would consider your argument, Mr. Rudolph, however, this<br />\n<br />\nis Johns Hopkins University and<br />\nMark's academic obligations are<br />\nundoubtedly more important. The<br />\nonly qualifications for Athlete of<br />\nthe Week are prowess and outstanding performance in one's sport.<br />\nYou need only to excel in your<br />\nsport and this Mark has unequivocably done numerous times. By<br />\nyour criteria, Mr. Rudolph, one<br />\ncould invalidate certain other previous selection of Athlete of the<br />\nWeek on the same grounds.<br />\nMay I add that I feed that you<br />\nMr. Rudolph, as an athlete are<br />\nlacking something crucial to the<br />\nunderstanding of sports. Athletes<br />\nare naturally geared to competition<br />\nbut they never should resort to this<br />\ntype of slander and defamation<br />\nwhen speaking of fellow athletes.<br />\nAthletics is a strange paradox of rigorotts competition and a singleness bonded by a respect for a fellow athlete's competence however<br />\nit measures, excelling or subordinating one's own.<br />\nKerry Spaven<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFred Rudolph's letter in the<br />\nMarch 7 News-Letter was the most<br />\noffensive group of thoughts I have<br />\never come across in this, more now<br />\nthan ever, doubtful publication.<br />\nRudolph used Mark Horning, a fellow athlete (an ex-fellow athlete<br />\nseeing how Fred quit the team) to<br />\nemphasize, in a twisted way, his<br />\npersonal opinions of the sviim<br />\nteam.. Rudolph tried to validate his<br />\nquitting through arbitrarily deciding that Mark Horning's performance as an athlete discredits the<br />\nswim team by the fact that he did<br />\nnot improve on his nationally ranked high school times; how assinine.<br />\nFirst and foremost, Rudolph obviously is ignorant of the essence<br />\nof athletic performance. Mark<br />\nHorning's purpose , reason, sweat,<br />\nmotivation, goal in swimming is a<br />\ncomplicated phenomena understood by, as any athletic performance, only by the athlete himself.<br />\nToo often today's athlete is short<br />\nchanged as a money-glory-fame<br />\nseeker rather than a personal fulfillment seeker. Hopkins because of<br />\nits correct academic orientation excels at extending mostly the personal fulfillment aspects of sports.<br />\nRudolph has abused Mark<br />\nHorning's personal fulfillment and<br />\nhas denigrated it by applying it to<br />\nhis own ends.<br />\nSecondly, Rudolph shows an im-,<br />\n<br />\nmulti-faceted learning experience<br />\n<br />\ncan be extremely time-consuming<br />\nand consequently academically<br />\nwounding. However, the health,<br />\nmental and physical, achieved<br />\nthrough accomplishing this feat enormously embellishes the<br />\nHopkins experiene, ans is well<br />\nworth the time and effort. However, what is invariably sacrificed<br />\nby combining both the academics<br />\nand the athletics, especially here at<br />\nHopkins, is blarent superiority in<br />\none's cum and/or one's athletic<br />\nperformance.<br />\nMark Horning's performance at<br />\nHopkins cannot be measured in the<br />\narbitrary, crass fashion which<br />\nRudolph uses. It is an injustice to<br />\nMark, the swim team, and to<br />\nHopkins. If Rudolph wants to<br />\nshow any perception at all of the<br />\nathletic experience, first he should<br />\nrejoin the swim team,.if that is impossible then he should apologize<br />\nto Mark, the swim team, and every<br />\nHopkins athlete who takes on the<br />\nstimulating but often frustrating<br />\nexperience of being \"a jock at the<br />\nHop.\"<br />\nIf Rudolph cannot understand<br />\nthis then I suggest he apply to be a<br />\nNews-Letter editor.

Basically<br />\nall fraternities, though apparently<br />\ndifferent, subscribe to the same ideals. This is where the problem<br />\nlies. Diversity is fine, but interaction is the key.

Livingston suffered a<br />\nsprained ankle in his third bout<br />\nof the day, which cost him a victory in the team event, as well as<br />\nthe individual title.<br />\nTom Slota and Tim Rogers<br />\nrepresented the Blue Jays in<br />\nepee. Slota, who was fencing<br />\nwith a bad flu, finished 9-3 on<br />\nthe A strip, while Rodgers was<br />\n11-1 on the B strip.<br />\nThe foil team, facing what<br />\nCoach Oles considered to be the<br />\ntoughest competition of the tourney, finished with co-captain<br />\nMike Brunner 6-6 on the A strip<br />\nand sophomore Dave Bell 8-4 on<br />\nthe B.<br />\nIn a daring move that paid off,<br />\nBruce Livingston was switched<br />\nback to sabre\u2014his forte\u2014to fill in<br />\nfor co-captain John Roberts, who<br />\ncould not make the trip. Sophomore Dave Bell sent into his first<br />\nmajor championship match, filling the vacancy opened in the<br />\nlineup shuffle.<br />\nThe team had anticipated a<br />\n<br />\nshot at third place, aware of the<br />\nstrength of the Penn State team,<br />\nwhich had beaten the Blue Jays<br />\nin the regular season. An additional threat was the strong<br />\nSeton Hall team, defending<br />\nchampions for the past three<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe Jays drew Seton Hall in<br />\nthe first round, and avenged last<br />\nyear's defeat with a convincing<br />\n5-1 victory. The rest of the day,<br />\nHopkins' only true rivalry came<br />\nfrom Penn State, whom they<br />\ndrew 3-3 and Binghamton.<br />\nAt the lunch break, the fencers<br />\nwere only one bout behind the<br />\nleaders, Penn and Binghamton,<br />\nand their expectations rose.<br />\nWhen Hopkins' strong sabre<br />\nteam finished their event, the<br />\nfencers were eight bouts ahead of<br />\nthe field. By the time epee was<br />\nthrough, Hopkins was only ahead<br />\nby four bouts and by the last<br />\nbout, the score was even at 54<br />\nall. Foilman Mike Brunner took<br />\nthe outcome of the tourney on<br />\nhis shoulders and beat his opponent 5-1 to win the NAC's for<br />\nHopkins 55-54.<br />\nAnother key bout, earlier in<br />\nthe day, was Tom Slota's win<br />\nover Penn's star foilman, 5-4.<br />\nThe Hopkins fencers took first<br />\nas a three-weapon team, first as<br />\nan epee team, and first as a sabre<br />\nteam, with Livingston and<br />\nBurton winning third and fourth<br />\nrespectively. The foil team finished fifth in a field of 1.3.<br />\nAll told, the fencers brought<br />\nhome 15 trophies after a successful performance which Coach<br />\nOles attributed to the team's<br />\n\"much better conditioning and<br />\ntraining than any of the other<br />\nteams, being very closely knit<br />\nand so being able to fill in any<br />\ngaps...not to mention a strategy<br />\nthat worked.\"<br />\nThe fencers have two last<br />\nmeets at home this Saturday and<br />\nthey travel to the NCAA's in<br />\nApril.<br />\n<br />\n\fmarch 11, 1975/news-letter/page 11<br />\n<br />\nHopkins lax-men eek out 13-11 verdict over Penn<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nPhiladelphia, \"the City of<br />\nBrotherly Love\" proved to be<br />\nless than lovely for the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team this weekend. The<br />\nJays travelled up to Quakerville<br />\non Saturday to meet the University of Pennsylvania in a scrimmage and barely returned unscathed. Homewood's stickmen<br />\neeked out a 13-11 victory over a<br />\nvastly improved Red-and-Blue<br />\nsquad.<br />\n\"Penn is 100% improved over<br />\n\u2022last year, personnel-wise,\" said<br />\nCoach Henry Ciccarone. \"They<br />\nhad an excellent freshmen team<br />\nlast year and those guys have<br />\ncontributed to improve them<br />\ngreatly. Also, they have been out<br />\npracticing longer than we have<br />\nand that showed in their stickwork. It also was much improved<br />\nover last year.\"<br />\n\"On the other hand, we did<br />\nplay poorly, especially our shooting. We strive to work for good,<br />\nintelligent shots on offense. We<br />\n<br />\ntry to fire 75% of our shots on<br />\nthe 6x6 goal area. Against Penn<br />\nwe didn't do that. We had only<br />\n50% of our shots on target. That<br />\nfact combined with fine play by<br />\ntheir goalie (he had 18 saves) limited the success of our offense.\"<br />\n\"Our clearing was also poor<br />\nthough our stickwork was better<br />\nthan it had been at similar times<br />\nin past years.\"<br />\nCiccarone continued, \"It was.<br />\nobvious that our team took Penn<br />\nlightly. There were two beneficial<br />\nthings however that came out of<br />\nthis game. First of all, it brOught<br />\nus back to reality, and secondly<br />\nit was good for a young team like<br />\nus to have participated in a tight<br />\npressure-packed game like this<br />\nearly in the season. I think this<br />\nwill definitely help us in preparation for similar type games during the regular season.\"<br />\nTruly outstanding play was<br />\nturned in by midfielder Jim<br />\nCahill who won 15 out of 15<br />\nface-ups. Ciccarone also noted<br />\n<br />\nthe fine play of goaltender<br />\nBobby Goldfarb who played the<br />\npressure-packed last quarter and<br />\na half and allowed only two goals<br />\none of which was on an unstoppable one-on-one situation. He<br />\nhad relieved Kevin Mahon who<br />\nplayed the first two and a half.<br />\nquarters.<br />\n\"All my goalies were aware,<br />\nprior to the game, of my intention to utilize two goalies per<br />\nscrimmage rather than all three,\"<br />\nnoted'Ciccarone. \"It takes goalies<br />\nabout half a quarter just to warm<br />\nup, so playing Goldfarb and<br />\nGodack for only one quarter<br />\neach (as in the Mt. Washington<br />\nscrimmage) wouldn't be fair to<br />\nthem. In the next game, against<br />\nHobart, Mike Godack will relieve<br />\nMahon and play the same time as<br />\nGoldfarb did on Saturday.\"<br />\nThe Jays controlled the<br />\nground balls which is a very important statistic in lacrosse for, as<br />\nCoach Ciccarone noted, \"If you<br />\nout ground ball the opposition,<br />\n<br />\nNEVVS-IETTER<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nStevens gladly fills SID shoes<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nAt most schools the man behind the athletic department's<br />\npublicity is a full-time, salaried<br />\nsports information director who<br />\nin many cases has a staff of assistants to aid him. At Hopkins however, this huge job is taken care<br />\nof by Craig Stevens and Craig<br />\nStevens alone.A special student<br />\nwho is fulfilling requirements for<br />\nmedical school, Stevens manges<br />\nto print up the programs, media<br />\nand press guides, send out press<br />\nreleases, compile statistics and<br />\nhandle the multitude of other<br />\njobs, while handling his studies as<br />\nwell.<br />\nWhile a Hopkins student, he<br />\nwas involved in intercollegiate<br />\nand wrestling.

After getting cut from the<br />\nLongmeadow, Massachusetts,<br />\nhoop team, the \"Cat\" (because<br />\nof his quick moves on the gridiron and on the Mat) went out<br />\nfor the wrestling team, to start<br />\nout an incredibly successful scholastic and collegiate wrestling career. After losing his first match<br />\n3-2, Stevens went undefeated and<br />\ncompiled an overall 26-1-1 high<br />\nschool record which included 14<br />\npin's. He won the Western Massachusetts title in- his junior and<br />\nsenior years and was selected outstanding wrestler at the tournament. He also co-captained the<br />\nsquad his junior and senior year.<br />\nAt Hopkins he continued where<br />\nhe left off on the mats. Stevens'<br />\n,wresting record at Homewood<br />\nwas 26-12-1 with 15 pins and he<br />\nagain served as co-captain his last<br />\ntwo years.

They've all done quite a bit<br />\nfor my life. Coaches like Dennis<br />\nCox and Harry Gotwals have<br />\nreally helped me as did Brandy<br />\nwho is incredible in his ability to<br />\nkeep athletes together.

Obviously it will be<br />\nimpossible to replace the man<br />\nwho won the title of the<br />\n\"World's Best Lacrosse Player\"<br />\nJack Thomas, but the Jays have<br />\nsome fine talent returning as well<br />\nas some good freshmen.

Returning 3rd team All-American<br />\nco-captain Dale Kohler leads the<br />\nJays midfielders.<br />\n\"Our first two midfield lines<br />\nare pretty well set,\" said Ciccarone. \"Dale Kohler, Don<br />\nZimmerman, and Tom Myrick<br />\nare on the first line, and Jim<br />\nCahill, Bill McCutcheon and Don<br />\nKurtz make up the second. The<br />\nthird line is up for grabs.\"<br />\nZimmerman is an outstanding<br />\nmidfieldprospect from St. Pauls<br />\nhere in Baltimore.

True to Savitz's claim, the Council has reached a level<br />\nof efficiency such that students are \"coming up through and<br />\nunder the auspices of the SC.\" This situation\u2014in addition to<br />\nmaking for an effective Council\u2014insures a succession of qualified leadership.<br />\nHowever, while the SC has earned an unquestioned degree<br />\nof respect in the Hopkins community in the past several<br />\nyears, much of the Council's unity and strength has been<br />\ndependant upon Savitz's own personal savvy and persistence.<br />\nThus much of the Council's efficacy as a body has depended<br />\nupon the force of one of its members.<br />\nWith a new President, the Council may have initial troubles<br />\ngetting on its feet after such a long and imperious stewardship. However, the fresh leadership may allow for a more<br />\nopen and participatory attitude in decision-making than has<br />\nexisted under Savitz. The best way to launch the new Council<br />\noff to a good start is for undergraduates to vote and demonstrate their faith in the SC\u2014whence, of course, the Council<br />\nderives most of its power.<br /><br />\nBy DAVID COPELAND<br />\nMost of you know that Joseph<br />\nHeller came to Baltimore Thursday<br />\nand spoke at Shriver Hall. You<br />\nmay also know that his speech was<br />\na part of the Milford H. Whitehill<br />\nLecture Series, sponsored by ODK,<br />\nthe leadership fraternity of Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nBut when Joseph Heller spoke<br />\nThursday, it was more than another lecture in the Whitehill Series.<br />\nThe Whitehill Series consists of lectures by recognized leaders of several fields. Yet Joseph Heller's<br />\nspeech marked the recognition by<br />\nODK that not all leaders are political. For the past several years, only<br />\npolitical leaders have spoken at the<br />\nWhitehill lectures. The ODK<br />\nshould not be faulted for this pattern. This thinking behind it is merely indicative of this country's<br />\nstilted perspective. One hundred<br />\nyears hence, Senator Mondale may<br />\nbe forgotten. Joseph Heller will remain an outstanding figure of this<br />\nera.<br />\nJoseph Heller is a leader in his<br />\nfield, yet he is atypical of that<br />\nfield. Fiction-writing in this country was only recently dominated<br />\nby John O'Hara, who never rewrote a line. Joseph Heller rewrites<br /><br />\nmore extensively (and more \"compulsively\" and \"neurotically,\" to<br />\nuse his own words) than any writer<br />\nin recent memory. He spent nine<br />\nyears writing Catch-22 and thirteen<br />\non Something Happened, his current novel. His concentration on a<br />\ngiven project is so total, that during those thirteen years, with the<br />\nsole exception of his play We Bombed in New Haven, he wrote<br />\nnothing else.<br />\nHeller pays perhaps more attention to the precision of his art than<br />\nany of his contemporaries, yet he<br />\nrebukes any attempt to have himself cast in the mold of the standard-bearer of great literature. In a<br />\nbrief, brilliant introduction to<br />\nJoseph Heller's speech, John Barth<br />\ncompared Heller's writing practices<br />\nto Homers's likening Catch-22 to<br />\nThe Iliad, and Something Happened to The Odyssey. He continued<br />\nby suggesting that Heller had adhered to Horace's credo of letting a<br />\nmanuscript mature for a long time.<br />\nYet, Barth was less than serious.<br />\nThe intent behind his humor was<br />\nto demonstrate that intense dedication which Heller gives to his craft.<br />\nEven at this whimsical compliment, Heller seemed to cringe. \"I<br />\ndon't know who Horace is,\" he<br /><br />\nsaid, and the audience laughed.<br />\n\"Homer I've heard of. And The<br />\nIliad I've heard of. But the comparisons are not only confusing but<br />\nembarrassing.\"<br />\nWhen Joseph Heller created Bob<br />\nSlocum, the protagonist of Something Happened, he went from the<br />\natypical to the revolutionary. Slocum is under fifty,. an executive,<br />\nwith a wife and three children, the<br />\nyoungest of whom is retarded. His<br />\nlife is monotonous. He is in many<br />\nways a despicable human being. He<br />\nfeels no love, only shame and resentment, towards his retarded<br />\nson. Bob Slocum cannot even<br />\nclaim for himself the comfort of<br />\nthe anti-hero. He is one of the<br />\nmost unlikely protagonists ever to<br />\nappear in fiction.<br />\nThe plot and the writing of<br />\nSomething Happened are deliberately monotonous. Nothing ever happens to Slocum, except once. Such<br />\nis his existence. Yet the sheer brilliance of the writing continually<br />\nimpresses the reader, as it did the<br />\naudience at Shriver Hall, who listened to Heller read from the novel.<br />\nWhat Joseph Heller did in Something Happened supposedly cannot<br />\nbe done. He went against every<br /><br />\nFraternities and rush: is college sickness gone?<br />\nBy MATT LASKOWSKI<br />\nOfficially rush is over, but its ramifications will manifest themselves throughout the remainder of<br />\nthe academic year. Maybe. Fraternities certainly aren't an omnipotent force on this campus(they vie<br />\nwith the Student Council for the<br />\nright to claim \"minimum effectiveness with a maximum of exposure\"). By my estimation over 400<br /><br />\npeople are in some way involved in<br />\nfraternity life. Certainly these<br />\nnumbers ought to accomplish more<br />\nthan a three week spree of parties.<br />\nThe question is, do they?<br />\nWindow-hopping<br />\nRegardless of the word's meaning, rush is capable of imparting a<br />\ngood deal of mush-mindedness, or<br />\nthe \"crazies\", in a pathetically<br />\nsmall number of Hopkins fact-<br /><br />\nheads. This brings to mind a phenomenon known as window hopping. As the name implies this<br />\ngame involves hurling oneself out a<br />\nfirst story window. We all know<br />\nthat this can be a bit of a rush, but<br />\nonly when people are prepared to<br />\ncatch your plummeting body. On<br />\nthe other hand certain precautions<br />\nmust be taken such as: opening the<br />\nwindow and alerting ground floor<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Student Council\u2014Honor<br />\nCommission committee's survey,<br />\nshowing that thirty percent of poie,a,<br /><br />\nv\u2018a<br /><br />\nq_racivake,s admitted,. to<br /><br />\nsimply because he does not live up<br />\nto his potential.

This is the essence of that ultra -coin p etitive, pre-professionalism which has been so much discussed here. Unless this attitude is<br />\ndiscarded, it will be in vaid to attempt to curtail cheating.<br />\nYour editorial in last Friday's<br />\nNews-Letter expressed valuable<br />\nprinciples but offered no means for<br />\ntheir realization. Perhaps a proctoring system would make students<br />\nwho cheat more aware that those<br />\nwho don't display honor do not<br />\ndeserve to have honor entrusted to<br />\nthem, and this could be step toward an honor system that works<br />\nbeing instituted when appropriate.<br />\nIn the meantime, it would seem<br />\nuseless to continue in the atmosphere that now exists, vainly<br />\nhoping that students will \"learn to<br />\nwork honestly.\"<br />\nMichael Bellow<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to dispute the growing sentiment that the Honor Code<br />\nis obsolete and ought to be abolished. Though there may be many<br />\npeople attending this institution<br />\nwho are unworthy, this problem<br />\nwill not be ameliorated by proctored exams. Cheaters may gain some<br />\ntemporary illusory advantage, however they will not escape some<br />\nform of retribution. The spiritual<br />\nmalignancy (substitute neurosis if<br />\nyou will) which is at the root of<br />\ncheating will eventually be their<br />\nundoing. I'm not necessarily evoking Karma here, there are more<br />\nmundane things such as ulcers., nervous breakdowns, and impotency<br />\nwhich can claim them.<br />\nFew would deny that honor is a<br />\nworthy ideal. In my opinion as ideal should be rejected when it is<br />\nfound to lack virtue, not because it<br />\nis not adhered to by a minority (or<br />\nmajority). I believe there are many<br />\nstudents at Hopkins who would<br />\nfeel affronted by the imposition of<br />\nproctored exams. We would be<br />\nproud to graduate from a University which upheld the Honor Code.<br />\nScott R. Reichard<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nwould like to take this opportut ity to object to the assertion<br />\ntha t Mark Horning does not deserye the title of Athlete of the Week<br /><br />\nNipmfromo,<br /><br />\nhaps I would consider your argument, Mr. Rudolph, however, this<br /><br />\nis Johns Hopkins University and<br />\nMark's academic obligations are<br />\nundoubtedly more important. The<br />\nonly qualifications for Athlete of<br />\nthe Week are prowess and outstanding performance in one's sport.<br />\nYou need only to excel in your<br />\nsport and this Mark has unequivocably done numerous times. By<br />\nyour criteria, Mr. Rudolph, one<br />\ncould invalidate certain other previous selection of Athlete of the<br />\nWeek on the same grounds.<br />\nMay I add that I feed that you<br />\nMr. Rudolph, as an athlete are<br />\nlacking something crucial to the<br />\nunderstanding of sports. Athletes<br />\nare naturally geared to competition<br />\nbut they never should resort to this<br />\ntype of slander and defamation<br />\nwhen speaking of fellow athletes.<br />\nAthletics is a strange paradox of rigorotts competition and a singleness bonded by a respect for a fellow athlete's competence however<br />\nit measures, excelling or subordinating one's own.<br />\nKerry Spaven<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nFred Rudolph's letter in the<br />\nMarch 7 News-Letter was the most<br />\noffensive group of thoughts I have<br />\never come across in this, more now<br />\nthan ever, doubtful publication.<br />\nRudolph used Mark Horning, a fellow athlete (an ex-fellow athlete<br />\nseeing how Fred quit the team) to<br />\nemphasize, in a twisted way, his<br />\npersonal opinions of the sviim<br />\nteam.. Rudolph tried to validate his<br />\nquitting through arbitrarily deciding that Mark Horning's performance as an athlete discredits the<br />\nswim team by the fact that he did<br />\nnot improve on his nationally ranked high school times; how assinine.<br />\nFirst and foremost, Rudolph obviously is ignorant of the essence<br />\nof athletic performance. Mark<br />\nHorning's purpose , reason, sweat,<br />\nmotivation, goal in swimming is a<br />\ncomplicated phenomena understood by, as any athletic performance, only by the athlete himself.<br />\nToo often today's athlete is short<br />\nchanged as a money-glory-fame<br />\nseeker rather than a personal fulfillment seeker. Hopkins because of<br />\nits correct academic orientation excels at extending mostly the personal fulfillment aspects of sports.<br />\nRudolph has abused Mark<br />\nHorning's personal fulfillment and<br />\nhas denigrated it by applying it to<br />\nhis own ends.<br />\nSecondly, Rudolph shows an im-,<br /><br />\nmulti-faceted learning experience<br /><br />\ncan be extremely time-consuming<br />\nand consequently academically<br />\nwounding. However, the health,<br />\nmental and physical, achieved<br />\nthrough accomplishing this feat enormously embellishes the<br />\nHopkins experiene, ans is well<br />\nworth the time and effort. However, what is invariably sacrificed<br />\nby combining both the academics<br />\nand the athletics, especially here at<br />\nHopkins, is blarent superiority in<br />\none's cum and/or one's athletic<br />\nperformance.<br />\nMark Horning's performance at<br />\nHopkins cannot be measured in the<br />\narbitrary, crass fashion which<br />\nRudolph uses. It is an injustice to<br />\nMark, the swim team, and to<br />\nHopkins. If Rudolph wants to<br />\nshow any perception at all of the<br />\nathletic experience, first he should<br />\nrejoin the swim team,.if that is impossible then he should apologize<br />\nto Mark, the swim team, and every<br />\nHopkins athlete who takes on the<br />\nstimulating but often frustrating<br />\nexperience of being \"a jock at the<br />\nHop.\"<br />\nIf Rudolph cannot understand<br />\nthis then I suggest he apply to be a<br />\nNews-Letter editor. Obviously if<br />\nthe editors publish such personally<br />\nmaligning letters and obviously if<br />\nthey use and abuse the NewsLetter much like Rudolph used<br />\nand abused Horning, then Rudolph<br />\nshould fit right in.<br />\nJack Coulter<br />\nBrian Coulter<br />\n11,11rtnri<br /><br />\ncollectivities of people brought together under the guise of free beer<br /><br />\nand women. Just as in Hutzler, certain individuals assume the passive<br />\nrole of furniture. The collective<br />\ncore of fraternity \"brothers\" are<br />\nmore concerned with people pissing in the halls, stereos getting lifted and cleaning up in the morning<br />\nthan with any kind of interaction.<br />\nThe Council on Inter-fraternity<br />\nAffairs is more concerned with arbitrating the complaints of one factions against another, than with inter-relating all of the factions into<br />\nsome semblance of unity. Basically<br />\nall fraternities, though apparently<br />\ndifferent, subscribe to the same ideals. This is where the problem<br />\nlies. Diversity is fine, but interaction is the key. Groups can strive<br />\nto be different while accomplishing<br />\na common goal. But this goal is lacking. Everyone concerned is either<br />\ntoo self-centered to recognize the<br />\nneed or too apathetic to care.<br />\nGroups of individuals strive to be<br />\ndifferent while alienating any conceivable common ground. Can you<br />\nimagine a party given by a few<br />\nhundred enthusiastic people representing everal different fraternities? The idea,of a joint party was<br />\nconsidered last semester but of<br />\ncourse it never materialized. That's<br />\nunfortunate. It would have been a<br />\nmove in an importantly different<br />\ndirection.<br />\nIt can be said that lacrosse<br />\ngames unite numbers not people.

Apartments are rented,<br />\nfraternities are joined. Once involved in a fraternity it is difficult to<br />\nadmit that you've made a mistake.<br />\nLeaving is a reflection on the<br />\nwhole group,its repercussions can<br />\nbe torturous.<br />\nIf you've taken the time and effort to consider all of the alternatives, and you honestly feel comfortable in a particular living situation<br />\nthen the chances are that you belong. In any event some element of<br />\nchance exists. It's similar to advertising for a roommate, except once<br />\ncommitted, it is easier to stay committed than it is to leave.<br />\nThe benefits are numerous, the<br />\npotential for improvement is present. Fraternities at Hopkins have<br />\ncontinued to flourish despite the<br />\nadvent of over-due attractions such<br />\nas the Rathskellar. Overall, fraternity popularity is a cyclic phenomena, this fact is obvious after examining old composite pictures.<br />\nA responsibility is in your hands<br />\nand mine; you. need not be an<br />\nintegral fraternity member to foster the change.

The advanced course will commence in<br />\nFebruary and it consists of free<br />\nclimbing, party climbing, and<br />\ntension climbing. The mountaineering student will benefit by<br />\ngaining confidence in his or her<br />\nability to overcome the basic<br />\nnatural fears associated with<br />\nheight and other seemingly hazardous situations encountered -in<br />\nthe mountains. This acquired<br />\nconfidence may also better enable the student to face situations in daily life.

The Jays are in the Southeast division with, among others,<br />\nlast year's champion Widener<br />\nCollege\u2014a team Coach Cox called<br />\n\"the one to beat.\"<br />\nIn regard to the overall ability<br />\nof this year's Blue Jay nine, Cox<br />\nsaid, \"The talent pool this year is<br />\nbetter\u2014 guys are generally more<br />\ntalented. However the team has<br />\nbeen hurt by the inability to<br />\npractice outside.\"<br />\nCoach Cox noted two goals for<br />\nthis year's squad. First, to improve on last year's record and second to win the MAC championship. Cox feels that both of these<br />\nare attainable, but adds that \"It'll<br />\ntake a lot of work--that's what<br />\nwe're doing now.\"<br />\nThe team has three scrimmages<br />\nthis week.

The tourney was<br />\nrun with two pools in each weapon. Strip A consisted, of all the<br />\nnumber one men while strip B<br />\nwas comprised of all the number<br />\ntwo men. Hopkins finished first<br />\nwith an overall record of 55-17 in<br />\nthe team competition.<br />\nThe victory was an astounding<br />\none considering that \"the team<br />\nhas been injured over and over<br />\nagain this season,\" as co-captain<br />\nMike Brunner explained. \"We<br />\nlost our top two foilmen this<br />\nyear and were forced to make<br />\ndramatic changes in the lineup,<br />\nyet we still came up with a spectacular season.\"<br />\nLeading the way to the Hopkins victory were the dominating<br />\nsabre teammates, Bruce<br />\nLivingston and Frank Burton.<br />\nLivingston ended up with a total<br />\nof 11-1 on the A strip while<br />\nBurton finished 10-2 on the B<br />\nstrip.

Slota, who was fencing<br />\nwith a bad flu, finished 9-3 on<br />\nthe A strip, while Rodgers was<br />\n11-1 on the B strip.<br />\nThe foil team, facing what<br />\nCoach Oles considered to be the<br />\ntoughest competition of the tourney, finished with co-captain<br />\nMike Brunner 6-6 on the A strip<br />\nand sophomore Dave Bell 8-4 on<br />\nthe B.<br />\nIn a daring move that paid off,<br />\nBruce Livingston was switched<br />\nback to sabre\u2014his forte\u2014to fill in<br />\nfor co-captain John Roberts, who<br />\ncould not make the trip. Sophomore Dave Bell sent into his first<br />\nmajor championship match, filling the vacancy opened in the<br />\nlineup shuffle.<br />\nThe team had anticipated a<br /><br />\nshot at third place, aware of the<br />\nstrength of the Penn State team,<br />\nwhich had beaten the Blue Jays<br />\nin the regular season. An additional threat was the strong<br />\nSeton Hall team, defending<br />\nchampions for the past three<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe Jays drew Seton Hall in<br />\nthe first round, and avenged last<br />\nyear's defeat with a convincing<br />\n5-1 victory. The rest of the day,<br />\nHopkins' only true rivalry came<br />\nfrom Penn State, whom they<br />\ndrew 3-3 and Binghamton.<br />\nAt the lunch break, the fencers<br />\nwere only one bout behind the<br />\nleaders, Penn and Binghamton,<br />\nand their expectations rose.<br />\nWhen Hopkins' strong sabre<br />\nteam finished their event, the<br />\nfencers were eight bouts ahead of<br />\nthe field. By the time epee was<br />\nthrough, Hopkins was only ahead<br />\nby four bouts and by the last<br />\nbout, the score was even at 54<br />\nall. Foilman Mike Brunner took<br />\nthe outcome of the tourney on<br />\nhis shoulders and beat his opponent 5-1 to win the NAC's for<br />\nHopkins 55-54.<br />\nAnother key bout, earlier in<br />\nthe day, was Tom Slota's win<br />\nover Penn's star foilman, 5-4.<br />\nThe Hopkins fencers took first<br />\nas a three-weapon team, first as<br />\nan epee team, and first as a sabre<br />\nteam, with Livingston and<br />\nBurton winning third and fourth<br />\nrespectively. The foil team finished fifth in a field of 1.3.<br />\nAll told, the fencers brought<br />\nhome 15 trophies after a successful performance which Coach<br />\nOles attributed to the team's<br />\n\"much better conditioning and<br />\ntraining than any of the other<br />\nteams, being very closely knit<br />\nand so being able to fill in any<br />\ngaps...not to mention a strategy<br />\nthat worked.\"<br />\nThe fencers have two last<br />\nmeets at home this Saturday and<br />\nthey travel to the NCAA's in<br />\nApril.<br /><br />\nmarch 11, 1975/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\nHopkins lax-men eek out 13-11 verdict over Penn<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nPhiladelphia, \"the City of<br />\nBrotherly Love\" proved to be<br />\nless than lovely for the Hopkins<br />\nlacrosse team this weekend. The<br />\nJays travelled up to Quakerville<br />\non Saturday to meet the University of Pennsylvania in a scrimmage and barely returned unscathed. Homewood's stickmen<br />\neeked out a 13-11 victory over a<br />\nvastly improved Red-and-Blue<br />\nsquad.<br />\n\"Penn is 100% improved over<br />\n\u2022last year, personnel-wise,\" said<br />\nCoach Henry Ciccarone. \"They<br />\nhad an excellent freshmen team<br />\nlast year and those guys have<br />\ncontributed to improve them<br />\ngreatly. Also, they have been out<br />\npracticing longer than we have<br />\nand that showed in their stickwork. It also was much improved<br />\nover last year.\"<br />\n\"On the other hand, we did<br />\nplay poorly, especially our shooting. We strive to work for good,<br />\nintelligent shots on offense. We<br /><br />\ntry to fire 75% of our shots on<br />\nthe 6x6 goal area. Against Penn<br />\nwe didn't do that. We had only<br />\n50% of our shots on target. That<br />\nfact combined with fine play by<br />\ntheir goalie (he had 18 saves) limited the success of our offense.\"<br />\n\"Our clearing was also poor<br />\nthough our stickwork was better<br />\nthan it had been at similar times<br />\nin past years.\"<br />\nCiccarone continued, \"It was.<br />\nobvious that our team took Penn<br />\nlightly. There were two beneficial<br />\nthings however that came out of<br />\nthis game. First of all, it brOught<br />\nus back to reality, and secondly<br />\nit was good for a young team like<br />\nus to have participated in a tight<br />\npressure-packed game like this<br />\nearly in the season. I think this<br />\nwill definitely help us in preparation for similar type games during the regular season.\"<br />\nTruly outstanding play was<br />\nturned in by midfielder Jim<br />\nCahill who won 15 out of 15<br />\nface-ups. Ciccarone also noted<br /><br />\nthe fine play of goaltender<br />\nBobby Goldfarb who played the<br />\npressure-packed last quarter and<br />\na half and allowed only two goals<br />\none of which was on an unstoppable one-on-one situation. He<br />\nhad relieved Kevin Mahon who<br />\nplayed the first two and a half.<br />\nquarters.<br />\n\"All my goalies were aware,<br />\nprior to the game, of my intention to utilize two goalies per<br />\nscrimmage rather than all three,\"<br />\nnoted'Ciccarone. \"It takes goalies<br />\nabout half a quarter just to warm<br />\nup, so playing Goldfarb and<br />\nGodack for only one quarter<br />\neach (as in the Mt. Washington<br />\nscrimmage) wouldn't be fair to<br />\nthem. In the next game, against<br />\nHobart, Mike Godack will relieve<br />\nMahon and play the same time as<br />\nGoldfarb did on Saturday.\"<br />\nThe Jays controlled the<br />\nground balls which is a very important statistic in lacrosse for, as<br />\nCoach Ciccarone noted, \"If you<br />\nout ground ball the opposition,<br /><br />\nNEVVS-IETTER<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nStevens gladly fills SID shoes<br />\nBy STEPHEN LEVIN<br />\nAt most schools the man behind the athletic department's<br />\npublicity is a full-time, salaried<br />\nsports information director who<br />\nin many cases has a staff of assistants to aid him.

They've all done quite a bit<br />\nfor my life. Coaches like Dennis<br />\nCox and Harry Gotwals have<br />\nreally helped me as did Brandy<br />\nwho is incredible in his ability to<br />\nkeep athletes together. I've met a<br />\nlot of people through athletics,<br />\nATO and H Club at Hopkins<br />\nwhom I never would have met<br />\notherwise and it's had a beneficial influence on me.\"<br /><br />\nthen you'll rarely lose.\" The Blue<br />\nJays out ground balled the<br />\nQuakers 63-52.

Obviously it will be<br />\nimpossible to replace the man<br />\nwho won the title of the<br />\n\"World's Best Lacrosse Player\"<br />\nJack Thomas, but the Jays have<br />\nsome fine talent returning as well<br />\nas some good freshmen. Junior<br />\nLarry Leonard who was last<br />\nyear's fourth attackman joins<br />\nthree freshmen who were high<br />\nschool All-Americans at attack.<br />\nMick O'Neil from Massapequa,<br />\nN.Y., Clark (Doober) Aburn<br />\nfrom Towson, and Joey Devlin<br />\nfrom St. Mary's here in Baltimore, all look to contribute to<br />\nthis year's Blue Jay offense.<br />\nLosing 5 of last year's top 9<br />\nmiddies (including three-time<br />\nAll-American Rick Kowalchuk)<br />\nleft the Jays depleted there. Returning 3rd team All-American<br />\nco-captain Dale Kohler leads the<br />\nJays midfielders.<br />\n\"Our first two midfield lines<br />\nare pretty well set,\" said Ciccarone. \"Dale Kohler, Don<br />\nZimmerman, and Tom Myrick<br />\nare on the first line, and Jim<br />\nCahill, Bill McCutcheon and Don<br />\nKurtz make up the second. The<br />\nthird line is up for grabs.\"<br />\nZimmerman is an outstanding<br />\nmidfieldprospect from St. Pauls<br />\nhere in Baltimore. He went to<br />\nRandolph-Macon before transfering to - Catonsville Community<br />\nCollege from which he graduated<br />\nlast year. Zimmerman is coming<br />\noff a knee operation but looks to<br />\nbe in shape for the season.<br />\nCiccarone highlighted the field<br /><br />\nDon Kurz<br />\nplay of Don Kurz as being truly<br />\nou Vstanding, especially against<br />\nPenn. The 5'8\" 155 sophomore<br />\nfrom Elmont, Long Island saw limited action last year and looks<br />\nto be a. main contributing force<br />\nthis season.<br />\nDefensively,' Hopkins is in the<br />\nenviable position of having three<br />\ntop-notch goalies while also being<br />\nin the unenviable position of<br />\nhaving to replace two All-American defensemen (Mike Siegert2nd team, and Bob Barbera\u2014<br />\nhonorable mention). Returning<br />\nare starter Dennis Gagomiros,last<br />\nyear's fourth defenseman Jim<br />\nMoorhead, and veterans Mike<br />\nReilly, and Jeff Jetzger.

Even<br />\nthough she was interested in<br />\nfencing early, there was no place<br />\nin Wichita where she could put<br /><br />\nher talent to use. That is until<br />\none day she noticed a high school<br />\nclassmate with bandages on her<br />\narm. Upon inquiring as to the<br />\nsource of the injuries, her wound.<br /><br />\nLoree eleher<br /><br />\ned friend replied, \"My brother'<br />\nwent overboard with a foil.\" After a few months of hedging,<br />\nLoree went and joined the \"travel ing\" fencing club of Wichita. It<br />\nseemed that this club was privately sponsored and therefore<br />\nhad little financial backing, so it<br />\nkept rotating its headquarters,<br />\nmaking it tough to keep tabs on.<br />\nShe finished tenth in the Intercollegiate Nationals over Christmas and then travelled up to<br />\nPortland, Oregon where she finished fifth in the Junior Olympic<br />\nChampionships. Her specialty is<br />\nfoil which is the only weapon she<br />\nfences in competition.<br />\n\"Besides keeping me physically fit, I enjoy the intellectual<br />\naspects of the game.
