It has been<br />\nconfirmed that these funds are<br />\nactually coming from Centennial<br />\nassets with $10 thousand coming<br />\ndirectly from President Muller's<br />\nspecial Centennial fund and $5<br />\nthousand from the University<br />\nCentennial Committee<br />\nSC leaders were told that<br />\n$15,000 in Centennial money<br />\nwould be available to them.<br />\nHowever, DR. Ferdinand<br />\nHamburger, Director of<br />\nUniversity Centennial Planning,<br />\nsaid at he knew only of an<br />\nunapproved SC request which<br />\nwas much less than this figure.<br />\nAccording to Ross Jones, Vice<br />\nPresident for University Affairs,<br />\n$15 thousand is a \"ball park<br />\nfigure.\" He stated that the<br />\nallotment will undergo additional<br />\nrevision.<br />\nThe money, however, must be<br />\nused for Centennial<br />\nprogramming.<br />\n\"There are certain funds<br />\navailable to President Muller<br />\nWhich he can draw upon for<br />\n<br />\nCentennial events,\" Jones said.<br />\nHall agreed with Jones that<br />\nMuller has access to Centennial<br />\nfunds, unrestricted in purpose.<br />\nHe added that Jones has<br />\npromised him $15 thousand for<br />\nthe SC budget, contingent upon<br />\nan approved SC Centennial<br />\nprogram.<br />\nHamburger indicated that he<br />\ndid not know of this arrangement<br />\nbut added that he was aware of<br />\ntwo student requests for<br />\nCentennial funds, which, if<br />\napproved, would come from his<br />\nbudget.<br />\n\"When I was working on the<br />\nUniversity Centennial Budget,<br />\nthe Student Centennial Activities<br />\nCommittee was still not well<br />\n'organized,\" Hamburger said. \"It<br />\nwas not known how much they<br />\nneeded so I just pulled a figure of<br />\n$5,000 out of thin air. Now that<br />\nthey are organized, their plans<br />\nrun in excess of the allotted<br />\nmoney and they are negotiated<br />\nfor more.\"<br />\nHamburger continued,\"There<br />\nis a new fact in the picture. SC<br />\norganizations have asked for<br />\nfunds to run Centennial events,<br />\nbut SAC cannot afford to finance<br />\nthem. That budget is now in my<br />\n<br />\nhands.\"<br />\n\"SAC people tried to get more<br />\nmoney this year, not for<br />\nCentennial projects, but because<br />\nthey have expanded their own<br />\nprograms,\" he concluded. \"Any<br />\nextra money they were promised<br />\nfor htis, to my knowledge is not<br />\ncoming from the Centennial<br />\nbudget.\"<br />\n'''The SAC was asking for<br />\n$10.000 more for Centennially<br />\nrelated events from Hamburger's<br />\noffice,\" said Alan Fink, SC<br />\nTreasurer. \"this was whittled<br />\ndown to $4,500.

One University<br />\nofficial described the difficulties being experienced with the<br />\nnew building as \"bugs that have to be worked out, like in any<br />\nnew building.\"<br />\nNeedless to say, the Union is infested with bugs. Costly<br />\nones. For instance, the Glass Pavilion and the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room can't be used at the same time. And<br />\nthe noise from the Rathskellar impinges on programs in the<br />\nL-V room. Likewise for the music practice rooms,<br />\nwhich<br />\ncleverly enough, weren't soundproofed sufficiently. Of<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion \u2014clearly an acoustical disaster --its architect<br />\nDonald Sicklcr rcrmarkcd at the Union's dedication that it is<br />\nin need of \"tuning.\"<br />\nUnder construction, the building was the biggest headache<br />\nthat plant officials have had to endure in more than a decade,<br />\naccording to one Plant Operations official. And now that it's<br />\ncompleted, well, what can one say about a room (The Glass<br />\nPavilion) that has to have $27 thousand dollars worth of<br />\ncurtains to \"tune\" it. As former Dean Robert Fitzpatrick<br />\npointed out, curtains in a room designed to constantly let as<br />\nmuch light in as possible makes no sense whatsoever.<br />\nAfter the destruction of two more shatterproof<br />\n\"unbreakable\" Pilkington Panes, we have proof positive that<br />\nsomething is drastically wrong with the construction of the<br />\nGlass Pavilion. At this point, it is time to stop marveling at<br />\nthe \"light and airy feeling\" of the building and make it<br />\nfunctional. Plans to change the glass to plexiglass or protect<br />\nthe glass with plastic seem like a good idea. Maybe after that,<br />\nthe building can be soundproofed.<br />\nNow that the University is considering a Biology building,<br />\nit would be well for its officials to bear the lessons of the<br />\nodious Union in mind, so that the painful experiences that<br />\nhave been, are, and will be, won't go for naught.<br />\n<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nCommunication Breakdown. An<br />\nold warhorse of a cliche, but one<br />\nwhich is appropriate when thinking<br />\nabout the Student Council at<br />\nHopkins. Whenever the<br />\norganization of an event at this<br />\nschool falls apart, Communication<br />\nis the villain, Communication is to<br />\nfault, individuals pass the blame to<br />\nothers, no one knows nuthin' from<br />\nnuthin' and Communication takes<br />\nthe rap. The most recent example<br />\nof this culprit's talent for creating<br />\nhavoc concerns the squabble<br />\nbetween Ocean Rose and the<br />\nStudent Council. Ocean Rose<br />\nalmost didn't play this weekend<br />\nbecause of an unfortunate and<br />\nalmost always bitter controversy.<br />\nBefore detailing this though, a note people is a fine display of unity,<br />\nof optimism is necessary.<br />\none which is too uncommon at<br />\nDue to the generous cooperation Homewood. And so the gig is on<br />\nof many organizations on Campus,<br />\nThe events prior to yesterday<br />\nOcean Rose will be performing in have not been as<br />\nharmonious,<br />\nthe freshman quad at 2 p.m. on however. The<br />\ncontroversy began<br />\nSunday, April 20. Last Wednesday, several weeks ago<br />\nwith a<br />\nApril 16, Ocean Rose was misunderstanding between<br />\nOcean<br />\ninformed that the Student Council Rose and the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nwas unable to fulfill a tenuous Ocean Rose<br />\nmade a verbal<br />\nfinancial agreement which was agreement with Savitz<br />\nand Student<br />\nworked out several weeks ago. Council Vice<br />\nPresident Eric<br />\nAccordingly, this Sunday's concert Rosenson to play<br />\nthree concerts in<br />\nwas cancelled. When this news was the spring<br />\nfor $1000. The dates<br />\ndelivered, various organizations were tentatively<br />\nApril 20, April 27,<br />\nvolunteered the money needed to and either<br />\nMay 3 or May 10.<br />\npay the band. The Sophomore Thinking<br />\nthat everything was<br />\nclass, Flying Monkey and the set tied,<br />\nOcean Rose began<br />\nNews\u2014Letter donated the practicing<br />\nfor the events. However,<br />\nsubstantial part of the cost. Other to Savitz and<br />\nRosenson, the verbal<br />\ngroups, such as the Junior class and agreement<br />\nwas less firm, just a<br />\nthe DSRC may contribute also. In \"good<br />\nidea\" to contemplate. Thus<br />\naddition, Student Council the explosion<br />\nwhen Rosenson<br />\nPresident Andy Savitz said that revealed to the<br />\nband that there<br />\nany funds that are lacking will be<br />\nprovided by the Student Council.<br />\nThe generosity exhibited by these<br />\n<br />\n17,Arr<br />\n<br />\n./-0417,<br />\n<br />\ndrd,<br />\n<br />\nHopkins it seems to me that the<br />\nquality of the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium has steadily declined,<br />\nreaching a low point in both<br />\nquality and attendance with last<br />\nyear's subject of \"Human<br />\nSexuality.\" This topic provided us<br />\nwith a cheaper way of seeing porno<br />\n\u2022flicks than going to the Rex<br />\ntheatre, but it hardly ranked as a<br />\ngreat educational experience.<br />\nWhile I sympathize with the<br />\nundergraduate's consuming interest<br />\nin sex (which, for better or worse,<br />\none outgrows), a symposium is a<br />\nlousy place to learn about it. Worse<br />\nyet, students, organizers of the<br />\nsymposium, and speakers treated<br />\nthe whole thing like the pop topic<br />\nit was and the whole symposium<br />\ndegenerated after Masters and<br />\nJohnson spoke.<br />\nThe previous year's symposium<br />\non \"Living with Change\" was<br />\nbetter conceived, but it too<br />\nsuffered from an utter lack of<br />\nfocus. \"Living with Change\"<br />\nsounds great, but as a symposium<br />\nit is a non-topic, as we learned the<br />\nhard way by hearing a stream of<br />\nspeakers confess they had no idea<br />\nwhat they were supposed to talk<br />\nabout, so they decided to speak on<br />\nsomething else entirely that<br />\ninterested them. (Buckminster<br />\nFuller comes to mind.)<br />\nHaving indulged ourselves in<br />\nthese attractive but rather<br />\nunsuccessful fantasies for a couple<br />\nof years, it is probably time that<br />\nwe choose a topic more carefully. I<br />\nsuggest that we find a topic which<br />\nhas a well-defined content, is<br />\nsuitable to the format of a series of<br />\nlectures, is educationally and/or<br />\nnationally signigicant, and can<br />\ndraw an audience. The first<br />\nEisenhower symposium was a<br />\nsuccess because of it. I hope the<br />\nSelections Committee and the<br />\nStudent body see fit to be more<br />\nrealistic in their choice this time<br />\naround.<br />\nDick Walker<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI wish to congratulate Michael<br />\nBrunner, President of Alpha<br />\nEpsilon Delta, for his fine letter<br />\n(4-15) in which he attempted to<br />\npoint out the ineptitudes of the<br />\nNews-Letter in publicizing recent<br />\nAED events. The point of my<br />\nletter, unfortunately, is to<br />\nillustrate one of my only<br />\nencounters with the organization<br />\nthat he heads. It was concerning<br />\nmy desire to become a member of<br />\nAED. The student body was<br />\n<br />\ninformed that applications would<br />\nbe available within a week<br />\ntime-period. I went to pick up an<br />\napplication in the lab, as<br />\ninstructed, and no one could help<br />\nme. I'm not complaining<br />\nthough...on my second attempt I<br />\nwas successful in receiving an<br />\napplication and signing up on an<br />\ninterview sheet. There were no<br />\n\u2018.r.t.e.r.e.v., time-slots left, Pkrt was<br />\nf.<br />\n,<br />\nI7C/1<br />\n<br />\nwas all set, I thought. My next<br />\ndisappointment came when all the<br />\nother applicants I talked to had<br />\nalready had their interviews. So I<br />\nreturned to the lab and again I was<br />\nassured that I would be notified. I<br />\nwas not. I returned once more and<br />\nwas told to call one of the<br />\nmembers to find out what<br />\nhappened. I thought to myself, if<br />\nthis is an example of how AED<br />\nfunctions, do I really want to be a<br />\nmember? Since then I have decided<br />\nthat I do not wish to be a member.<br />\nThe point I wish to make is that if<br />\nthe News-Letter is doing such a<br />\nterrible job, then why does Mr.<br />\nBrunner continue to use it?<br />\nIt seems appropriate to address<br />\nMr. Brunner using his own words.<br />\n\"Actually, I'd like to thank you<br />\nonce again for screwing up as much<br />\nas you do. Otherwise, someone<br />\nmight be able to accuse you of<br />\ndoing your job well.\"<br />\nMark Spatola<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe have just finished reading<br />\nVincent Demarco's and Bernard<br />\nHorn's well-intended \"Just Who's<br />\nAttacking Who. Anyway?\"<br />\n(News-Letter, April 15). It is all so<br />\nfamiliar. Dean Rusk, for one, said<br />\nit over ten years ago.<br />\nWe realize it is probably futile to<br />\ntry to expose the nature of reality<br />\nin Indo-China to those who remain<br />\nbefogged after 25 years of<br />\nAmerican-sponsored propaganda.<br />\nbloodletting and intervention in a<br />\nrevolutionary civil war. Reality is<br />\nstill too encrusted with<br />\nmythologies about \"our\"<br />\nhumanity and \"their\" inhumanity.<br />\nwhich are nourished by scattered<br />\nhalf-truths and facts wrenched out<br />\nof context.<br />\nBut two things are crystal clear.<br />\nFirst, the bloodbaths the authors<br />\nso fear, the individual and societal<br />\ntortures they so oppose, have been<br />\nperpetrated for more than two<br />\ndecades on a mass scale primarily<br />\nby our side. We have dmne this<br />\nobscenely in the name of freedom,<br />\nself-determination and every other<br />\ndecent principle Americans have<br />\nhonored more often in the breach<br />\nthan in the observance.<br />\nSecond, all the human tragedies<br />\nthat reach out as if to touch us in<br />\nour very kitchens and dining rooms<br />\neach night are important not just<br />\nin themselves. They also represent<br />\nthe culmination of a process that<br />\nhas been studded with such<br />\ntragedies. Looking at its<br />\nculmination, so reminiscent of<br />\n<br />\n1949 in China, we react as we did<br />\nin 1949, seeing what is going on as<br />\na tragedy. That is wrong.<br />\nThe historical process itself, as<br />\nthe Chinese Revolution has made<br />\nSO clear, is far from a tragedy. It is.<br />\nn truth, nothing less than the<br />\nbeginning of the end of class and<br />\nforeign rule in Vietnam. It is the<br />\n. .<br />\nvictory ot revolution and tile<br />\nliberation of an entice people<br />\nflC<br />\n<br />\nbit curious that Rosenson and the<br />\nSocial Committee feel that they<br />\ncan define musical taste and<br />\npopularity for the student body.<br />\nMaking the situation even more<br />\ntangled is the apparent resentment<br />\nbetween Ocean Rose and the<br />\noperators of the Hopkins sound<br />\nsystem. When informed that the<br />\nband will use Sawmill sound for<br />\ntheir concerts, the men manning<br />\nthe Hopkins controls very nearly<br />\nlost their minds. Caustically, one<br />\nof these operators told a member<br />\nof the band that they better<br />\npractice pretty damn hard, because<br />\nthe last time he saw them, \"they<br />\nsucked.\" The performance he was<br />\nreferring to was the band showcase<br />\npresented by Flying Monkey<br />\nearlier this semester. None of the<br />\nbands sounded quite right at this<br />\nevent, which featured the newly<br />\narrived Hopkins sound system,<br />\nwhich was not yet mastered by<br />\nthose controlling it. Therefore. it is<br />\nhard to criticize Ocean Rose's<br />\nshort stint.<br />\nDespite the misunderstandings,<br />\npersonality clashes and feelings of<br />\nresentment, this controversy has<br />\nbeen at least partially settled. The<br />\nfunds necessary were found because<br />\nstudents want to hear Ocean Rose.<br />\nBut still this chain of events is odd<br />\nand Communication cannot take<br />\nthe whole blame. Students with<br />\ndecision-making power have to<br />\nmake the effort to communicate<br />\nmore with each other. Personality<br />\ndifferences should be put aside;<br />\nbusiness transactions have to be<br />\nless chaotic. What is clear is that<br />\nsome people somewhere have to<br />\nget it together sometime, soon.<br />\n<br />\nDisregard that man behind the curtain<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs I understand it, topics for<br />\nnext year's Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium have been presented to<br />\nthe Selections Committee of the<br />\nStudent Council and will soon be<br />\nbrought up for a student vote.<br />\nTherefore, I would like to address<br />\nmyself to that Committee and to<br />\nme stuuent uouy in g,enerdi on trie<br />\nquestion 0 f what sort oc<br />\n<br />\nwasn't enough money to meet this<br />\nagreement, one which Savitz and<br />\nRosenson had forgotten about in<br />\nthe meantime. Both parties were at<br />\n<br />\nfault in this situation; Ocean Rose<br />\nshould have pressed for a more<br />\ndefinite commitment, while Savitz<br />\nand Rosenson should not have<br />\nbeen as carefree with their<br />\npropositions. Blame it on<br />\nCommunication.<br />\nBut money isn't the only<br />\ndifficulty in this multi-faceted<br />\nproblem. It seems the band's<br />\nquality and popularity have been<br />\nquestioned in the Social<br />\nCommittee of the Student Council.<br />\nEric Rosenson, as spokesman of<br />\nthe Social Committe, said that<br />\nOcean Rose has been performing<br />\ntoo often at Hopkins and that<br />\nstudents tire of the band. In fact,<br />\nOcean Rose has played just once<br />\nthis semester, as contrasted to the<br />\nnumerous performances by other<br />\ngroups at Hopkins. Judging by past<br />\nconcerts, the number of fans<br />\nattracted by Ocean Rose is<br />\nunmatched. Also, _it seems just a<br />\n<br />\nr fit<br />\n<br />\nv iernarnese<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nanu<br />\n<br />\nThe fat can get fatter.

The Jays have won<br />\nnine and tied one of the team's<br />\nten meetings since then,<br />\nincluding a 13-8 victory at<br />\nHomewood last year.<br />\nThe key to the success of this<br />\nyear's Cornell squad lies in its<br />\npowerful attack unit. Despite the<br />\nloss of All-American attack ace<br />\nJim Trenz to graduation, the Big<br />\nRed boast when Hopkins Coach<br />\nHenry Ciccarone has called \"on<br />\npaper, the best attack in the<br />\ncountry including our own!\"<br />\nLeading that trio is junior<br />\nnumber 17 Mike French, a 6'2\",<br />\n200 pounder who led the nation<br />\nin scoring last year as a<br />\nsophomore. On the basis of that,<br />\nit was a surprise when French<br />\nwas only named to the attack of<br />\nlast year's Third All-American<br />\nteam. \"French was good last year<br />\nand he'll get better,\" noted<br />\nCornell Coach Richie Moran.<br />\nFrench is having another fine<br />\nseason with 28 goals so tar.

He stole second,<br />\n<br />\nmoved to third on a single by<br />\nDave Emala, and scored on a<br />\nwixd pitch. Hopkins added two<br />\ntallies in the third.

Against Salisbury,<br />\nvictories were amassed by .<br />\nnumber one started Rich<br />\nNomady, Chuck McCulloch at<br />\nfourth singles, and the third<br />\ndoubles combination of Chuck<br />\nMcCulloch and Waterman. Later,<br />\nSwarthmore saw Nomady and<br />\nthe number one doubles team of<br />\nNomady and John Newman<br />\ndonating the pair of victories.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' second match<br />\nwas against Gettysburg where<br />\nthey won 8-1. Winning in singles<br />\nwere Nomady, Jeff Gould,<br />\nNewman, Waterman and<br />\nSwimmer. Hopkins swept the<br />\ndoubles matches, teaming<br />\nN omady-Newman,<br />\nG ould -Swimmer, and<br />\nWaterman-McCulloch.<br />\nFollowing spring break, the<br />\nteam faced a number of setbacks<br />\nwith the loss of starters Mark<br />\nUnis and Fred Waterman. In their<br />\nnext match they succumbed to<br />\nthe strength of Delaware's team<br />\nand the 40 mile per hour winds<br />\nbehind them, losing 1-8. The sole<br />\nvictor for Hopkins was Jeff<br />\nGould at second singles who<br />\noverpowered his opponent 705,<br />\n6-0. The tide finally turned for<br />\nthe Hopkins netmen with<br />\n<br />\nvictories over Catholic University<br />\nand Loyola College last week by<br />\nscores 6-3 and 5-4. Over Catholic<br />\nUniversity, three of the four<br />\nsingles victories were hard-won in<br />\nthree sets in favor of Nomady,<br />\nGould, and Little, with only<br />\njunior Gary Swimmer winning in<br />\nstraight sets. Doubles wins came<br />\nfrom Nomady\u2014newman and<br />\nMcCulloch-Little who exploded<br />\nto a 6-1, 6-1 victory.<br />\nLoyola was undoubtedly the<br />\nmost exciting and hair-raising<br />\nmatch for the Hopkin:<br />\nracqueteers. Close rivals for the<br />\npast few years, Hopkins edged<br />\nout a 5-4 victory. Tied at<br />\nthree-all at the end of the singles,<br />\nthanks to victors Newman,<br />\nSwimmer and McCulloch, all eyes<br />\nwere on the doubles. A first<br />\ndoubles loss followed by a<br />\nvictory for the third doubles<br />\nteam of McCulloch-Little, kept<br />\nthe match even as<br />\nGould-Swimmer's deciding match<br />\nwent into its third set and<br />\ndarkness set in. In almost total<br />\ndarkness and bitter cold the set<br />\nwent down to the wire but<br />\nHopkins won the tie-breaker 5-2<br />\nand, with that, the entire match.<br />\nLast Saturday the tennis team<br />\nmet Haverford at home and was<br />\ndisappointed by this unexpected<br />\nloss. Rich Nomady won in three<br />\nsets as did Kevin Little at fifth<br />\nsingles while third singles player,<br />\nJmhn Newman rounded out the<br />\nHopkins victories. The final<br />\nscore: 3-6.<br />\nOn Monday, Hopkins took a<br />\nbad beating from the perennially<br />\npowerful University of Maryland<br />\n(currently 22-0) led by John<br />\nLucas. Rich Nomady made it a<br />\nclose match in front of the<br />\nlargest crowd in recent years at<br />\nthe Homewood courts.<br />\nThe Blue Jays played Westerr<br />\nMaryland on Wednesday and<br />\ncame home 7-2 victors. Rich<br />\nNomady again won at first singles<br />\n(3-6, 6-1, 6-1). Jeff Gould (6-1<br />\n<br />\n6-1), John Newman (6-1,6-2) and<br />\nChuck McCulloch (6-1, 6-4) were<br />\nall singles winners.

It has been<br />\nconfirmed that these funds are<br />\nactually coming from Centennial<br />\nassets with $10 thousand coming<br />\ndirectly from President Muller's<br />\nspecial Centennial fund and $5<br />\nthousand from the University<br />\nCentennial Committee<br />\nSC leaders were told that<br />\n$15,000 in Centennial money<br />\nwould be available to them.<br />\nHowever, DR. Ferdinand<br />\nHamburger, Director of<br />\nUniversity Centennial Planning,<br />\nsaid at he knew only of an<br />\nunapproved SC request which<br />\nwas much less than this figure.<br />\nAccording to Ross Jones, Vice<br />\nPresident for University Affairs,<br />\n$15 thousand is a \"ball park<br />\nfigure.\" He stated that the<br />\nallotment will undergo additional<br />\nrevision.<br />\nThe money, however, must be<br />\nused for Centennial<br />\nprogramming.<br />\n\"There are certain funds<br />\navailable to President Muller<br />\nWhich he can draw upon for<br /><br />\nCentennial events,\" Jones said.<br />\nHall agreed with Jones that<br />\nMuller has access to Centennial<br />\nfunds, unrestricted in purpose.<br />\nHe added that Jones has<br />\npromised him $15 thousand for<br />\nthe SC budget, contingent upon<br />\nan approved SC Centennial<br />\nprogram.<br />\nHamburger indicated that he<br />\ndid not know of this arrangement<br />\nbut added that he was aware of<br />\ntwo student requests for<br />\nCentennial funds, which, if<br />\napproved, would come from his<br />\nbudget.<br />\n\"When I was working on the<br />\nUniversity Centennial Budget,<br />\nthe Student Centennial Activities<br />\nCommittee was still not well<br />\n'organized,\" Hamburger said. \"It<br />\nwas not known how much they<br />\nneeded so I just pulled a figure of<br />\n$5,000 out of thin air. Now that<br />\nthey are organized, their plans<br />\nrun in excess of the allotted<br />\nmoney and they are negotiated<br />\nfor more.\"<br />\nHamburger continued,\"There<br />\nis a new fact in the picture. SC<br />\norganizations have asked for<br />\nfunds to run Centennial events,<br />\nbut SAC cannot afford to finance<br />\nthem. That budget is now in my<br /><br />\nhands.\"<br />\n\"SAC people tried to get more<br />\nmoney this year, not for<br />\nCentennial projects, but because<br />\nthey have expanded their own<br />\nprograms,\" he concluded. \"Any<br />\nextra money they were promised<br />\nfor htis, to my knowledge is not<br />\ncoming from the Centennial<br />\nbudget.\"<br />\n'''The SAC was asking for<br />\n$10.000 more for Centennially<br />\nrelated events from Hamburger's<br />\noffice,\" said Alan Fink, SC<br />\nTreasurer. \"this was whittled<br />\ndown to $4,500.

One University<br />\nofficial described the difficulties being experienced with the<br />\nnew building as \"bugs that have to be worked out, like in any<br />\nnew building.\"<br />\nNeedless to say, the Union is infested with bugs. Costly<br />\nones. For instance, the Glass Pavilion and the<br />\nListening-Viewing Room can't be used at the same time. And<br />\nthe noise from the Rathskellar impinges on programs in the<br />\nL-V room. Likewise for the music practice rooms,<br />\nwhich<br />\ncleverly enough, weren't soundproofed sufficiently. Of<br />\nthe Glass Pavilion \u2014clearly an acoustical disaster --its architect<br />\nDonald Sicklcr rcrmarkcd at the Union's dedication that it is<br />\nin need of \"tuning.\"<br />\nUnder construction, the building was the biggest headache<br />\nthat plant officials have had to endure in more than a decade,<br />\naccording to one Plant Operations official. And now that it's<br />\ncompleted, well, what can one say about a room (The Glass<br />\nPavilion) that has to have $27 thousand dollars worth of<br />\ncurtains to \"tune\" it. As former Dean Robert Fitzpatrick<br />\npointed out, curtains in a room designed to constantly let as<br />\nmuch light in as possible makes no sense whatsoever.<br />\nAfter the destruction of two more shatterproof<br />\n\"unbreakable\" Pilkington Panes, we have proof positive that<br />\nsomething is drastically wrong with the construction of the<br />\nGlass Pavilion. At this point, it is time to stop marveling at<br />\nthe \"light and airy feeling\" of the building and make it<br />\nfunctional. Plans to change the glass to plexiglass or protect<br />\nthe glass with plastic seem like a good idea. Maybe after that,<br />\nthe building can be soundproofed.<br />\nNow that the University is considering a Biology building,<br />\nit would be well for its officials to bear the lessons of the<br />\nodious Union in mind, so that the painful experiences that<br />\nhave been, are, and will be, won't go for naught.<br /><br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nCommunication Breakdown. An<br />\nold warhorse of a cliche, but one<br />\nwhich is appropriate when thinking<br />\nabout the Student Council at<br />\nHopkins. Whenever the<br />\norganization of an event at this<br />\nschool falls apart, Communication<br />\nis the villain, Communication is to<br />\nfault, individuals pass the blame to<br />\nothers, no one knows nuthin' from<br />\nnuthin' and Communication takes<br />\nthe rap. The most recent example<br />\nof this culprit's talent for creating<br />\nhavoc concerns the squabble<br />\nbetween Ocean Rose and the<br />\nStudent Council. Ocean Rose<br />\nalmost didn't play this weekend<br />\nbecause of an unfortunate and<br />\nalmost always bitter controversy.<br />\nBefore detailing this though, a note people is a fine display of unity,<br />\nof optimism is necessary.<br />\none which is too uncommon at<br />\nDue to the generous cooperation Homewood. And so the gig is on<br />\nof many organizations on Campus,<br />\nThe events prior to yesterday<br />\nOcean Rose will be performing in have not been as<br />\nharmonious,<br />\nthe freshman quad at 2 p.m. on however. The<br />\ncontroversy began<br />\nSunday, April 20. Last Wednesday, several weeks ago<br />\nwith a<br />\nApril 16, Ocean Rose was misunderstanding between<br />\nOcean<br />\ninformed that the Student Council Rose and the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nwas unable to fulfill a tenuous Ocean Rose<br />\nmade a verbal<br />\nfinancial agreement which was agreement with Savitz<br />\nand Student<br />\nworked out several weeks ago. Council Vice<br />\nPresident Eric<br />\nAccordingly, this Sunday's concert Rosenson to play<br />\nthree concerts in<br />\nwas cancelled. When this news was the spring<br />\nfor $1000. The dates<br />\ndelivered, various organizations were tentatively<br />\nApril 20, April 27,<br />\nvolunteered the money needed to and either<br />\nMay 3 or May 10.<br />\npay the band. The Sophomore Thinking<br />\nthat everything was<br />\nclass, Flying Monkey and the set tied,<br />\nOcean Rose began<br />\nNews\u2014Letter donated the practicing<br />\nfor the events. However,<br />\nsubstantial part of the cost. Other to Savitz and<br />\nRosenson, the verbal<br />\ngroups, such as the Junior class and agreement<br />\nwas less firm, just a<br />\nthe DSRC may contribute also. In \"good<br />\nidea\" to contemplate. Thus<br />\naddition, Student Council the explosion<br />\nwhen Rosenson<br />\nPresident Andy Savitz said that revealed to the<br />\nband that there<br />\nany funds that are lacking will be<br />\nprovided by the Student Council.<br />\nThe generosity exhibited by these<br /><br />\n17,Arr<br /><br />\n./-0417,<br /><br />\ndrd,<br /><br />\nHopkins it seems to me that the<br />\nquality of the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium has steadily declined,<br />\nreaching a low point in both<br />\nquality and attendance with last<br />\nyear's subject of \"Human<br />\nSexuality.\" This topic provided us<br />\nwith a cheaper way of seeing porno<br />\n\u2022flicks than going to the Rex<br />\ntheatre, but it hardly ranked as a<br />\ngreat educational experience.<br />\nWhile I sympathize with the<br />\nundergraduate's consuming interest<br />\nin sex (which, for better or worse,<br />\none outgrows), a symposium is a<br />\nlousy place to learn about it. Worse<br />\nyet, students, organizers of the<br />\nsymposium, and speakers treated<br />\nthe whole thing like the pop topic<br />\nit was and the whole symposium<br />\ndegenerated after Masters and<br />\nJohnson spoke.<br />\nThe previous year's symposium<br />\non \"Living with Change\" was<br />\nbetter conceived, but it too<br />\nsuffered from an utter lack of<br />\nfocus. \"Living with Change\"<br />\nsounds great, but as a symposium<br />\nit is a non-topic, as we learned the<br />\nhard way by hearing a stream of<br />\nspeakers confess they had no idea<br />\nwhat they were supposed to talk<br />\nabout, so they decided to speak on<br />\nsomething else entirely that<br />\ninterested them. (Buckminster<br />\nFuller comes to mind.)<br />\nHaving indulged ourselves in<br />\nthese attractive but rather<br />\nunsuccessful fantasies for a couple<br />\nof years, it is probably time that<br />\nwe choose a topic more carefully. I<br />\nsuggest that we find a topic which<br />\nhas a well-defined content, is<br />\nsuitable to the format of a series of<br />\nlectures, is educationally and/or<br />\nnationally signigicant, and can<br />\ndraw an audience. The first<br />\nEisenhower symposium was a<br />\nsuccess because of it. I hope the<br />\nSelections Committee and the<br />\nStudent body see fit to be more<br />\nrealistic in their choice this time<br />\naround.<br />\nDick Walker<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI wish to congratulate Michael<br />\nBrunner, President of Alpha<br />\nEpsilon Delta, for his fine letter<br />\n(4-15) in which he attempted to<br />\npoint out the ineptitudes of the<br />\nNews-Letter in publicizing recent<br />\nAED events. The point of my<br />\nletter, unfortunately, is to<br />\nillustrate one of my only<br />\nencounters with the organization<br />\nthat he heads. It was concerning<br />\nmy desire to become a member of<br />\nAED. The student body was<br /><br />\ninformed that applications would<br />\nbe available within a week<br />\ntime-period. I went to pick up an<br />\napplication in the lab, as<br />\ninstructed, and no one could help<br />\nme. I'm not complaining<br />\nthough...on my second attempt I<br />\nwas successful in receiving an<br />\napplication and signing up on an<br />\ninterview sheet. There were no<br />\n\u2018.r.t.e.r.e.v., time-slots left, Pkrt was<br />\nf.<br />\n,<br />\nI7C/1<br /><br />\nwas all set, I thought. My next<br />\ndisappointment came when all the<br />\nother applicants I talked to had<br />\nalready had their interviews. So I<br />\nreturned to the lab and again I was<br />\nassured that I would be notified. I<br />\nwas not. I returned once more and<br />\nwas told to call one of the<br />\nmembers to find out what<br />\nhappened. I thought to myself, if<br />\nthis is an example of how AED<br />\nfunctions, do I really want to be a<br />\nmember? Since then I have decided<br />\nthat I do not wish to be a member.<br />\nThe point I wish to make is that if<br />\nthe News-Letter is doing such a<br />\nterrible job, then why does Mr.<br />\nBrunner continue to use it?<br />\nIt seems appropriate to address<br />\nMr. Brunner using his own words.<br />\n\"Actually, I'd like to thank you<br />\nonce again for screwing up as much<br />\nas you do. Otherwise, someone<br />\nmight be able to accuse you of<br />\ndoing your job well.\"<br />\nMark Spatola<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe have just finished reading<br />\nVincent Demarco's and Bernard<br />\nHorn's well-intended \"Just Who's<br />\nAttacking Who. Anyway?\"<br />\n(News-Letter, April 15). It is all so<br />\nfamiliar. Dean Rusk, for one, said<br />\nit over ten years ago.<br />\nWe realize it is probably futile to<br />\ntry to expose the nature of reality<br />\nin Indo-China to those who remain<br />\nbefogged after 25 years of<br />\nAmerican-sponsored propaganda.<br />\nbloodletting and intervention in a<br />\nrevolutionary civil war. Reality is<br />\nstill too encrusted with<br />\nmythologies about \"our\"<br />\nhumanity and \"their\" inhumanity.<br />\nwhich are nourished by scattered<br />\nhalf-truths and facts wrenched out<br />\nof context.<br />\nBut two things are crystal clear.<br />\nFirst, the bloodbaths the authors<br />\nso fear, the individual and societal<br />\ntortures they so oppose, have been<br />\nperpetrated for more than two<br />\ndecades on a mass scale primarily<br />\nby our side. We have dmne this<br />\nobscenely in the name of freedom,<br />\nself-determination and every other<br />\ndecent principle Americans have<br />\nhonored more often in the breach<br />\nthan in the observance.<br />\nSecond, all the human tragedies<br />\nthat reach out as if to touch us in<br />\nour very kitchens and dining rooms<br />\neach night are important not just<br />\nin themselves. They also represent<br />\nthe culmination of a process that<br />\nhas been studded with such<br />\ntragedies. Looking at its<br />\nculmination, so reminiscent of<br /><br />\n1949 in China, we react as we did<br />\nin 1949, seeing what is going on as<br />\na tragedy. That is wrong.<br />\nThe historical process itself, as<br />\nthe Chinese Revolution has made<br />\nSO clear, is far from a tragedy. It is.<br />\nn truth, nothing less than the<br />\nbeginning of the end of class and<br />\nforeign rule in Vietnam. It is the<br />\n. .<br />\nvictory ot revolution and tile<br />\nliberation of an entice people<br />\nflC<br /><br />\nbit curious that Rosenson and the<br />\nSocial Committee feel that they<br />\ncan define musical taste and<br />\npopularity for the student body.<br />\nMaking the situation even more<br />\ntangled is the apparent resentment<br />\nbetween Ocean Rose and the<br />\noperators of the Hopkins sound<br />\nsystem. When informed that the<br />\nband will use Sawmill sound for<br />\ntheir concerts, the men manning<br />\nthe Hopkins controls very nearly<br />\nlost their minds. Caustically, one<br />\nof these operators told a member<br />\nof the band that they better<br />\npractice pretty damn hard, because<br />\nthe last time he saw them, \"they<br />\nsucked.\" The performance he was<br />\nreferring to was the band showcase<br />\npresented by Flying Monkey<br />\nearlier this semester. None of the<br />\nbands sounded quite right at this<br />\nevent, which featured the newly<br />\narrived Hopkins sound system,<br />\nwhich was not yet mastered by<br />\nthose controlling it. Therefore. it is<br />\nhard to criticize Ocean Rose's<br />\nshort stint.<br />\nDespite the misunderstandings,<br />\npersonality clashes and feelings of<br />\nresentment, this controversy has<br />\nbeen at least partially settled. The<br />\nfunds necessary were found because<br />\nstudents want to hear Ocean Rose.<br />\nBut still this chain of events is odd<br />\nand Communication cannot take<br />\nthe whole blame. Students with<br />\ndecision-making power have to<br />\nmake the effort to communicate<br />\nmore with each other. Personality<br />\ndifferences should be put aside;<br />\nbusiness transactions have to be<br />\nless chaotic. What is clear is that<br />\nsome people somewhere have to<br />\nget it together sometime, soon.<br /><br />\nDisregard that man behind the curtain<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs I understand it, topics for<br />\nnext year's Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium have been presented to<br />\nthe Selections Committee of the<br />\nStudent Council and will soon be<br />\nbrought up for a student vote.<br />\nTherefore, I would like to address<br />\nmyself to that Committee and to<br />\nme stuuent uouy in g,enerdi on trie<br />\nquestion 0 f what sort oc<br /><br />\nwasn't enough money to meet this<br />\nagreement, one which Savitz and<br />\nRosenson had forgotten about in<br />\nthe meantime. Both parties were at<br /><br />\nfault in this situation; Ocean Rose<br />\nshould have pressed for a more<br />\ndefinite commitment, while Savitz<br />\nand Rosenson should not have<br />\nbeen as carefree with their<br />\npropositions. Blame it on<br />\nCommunication.<br />\nBut money isn't the only<br />\ndifficulty in this multi-faceted<br />\nproblem. It seems the band's<br />\nquality and popularity have been<br />\nquestioned in the Social<br />\nCommittee of the Student Council.<br />\nEric Rosenson, as spokesman of<br />\nthe Social Committe, said that<br />\nOcean Rose has been performing<br />\ntoo often at Hopkins and that<br />\nstudents tire of the band. In fact,<br />\nOcean Rose has played just once<br />\nthis semester, as contrasted to the<br />\nnumerous performances by other<br />\ngroups at Hopkins. Judging by past<br />\nconcerts, the number of fans<br />\nattracted by Ocean Rose is<br />\nunmatched. Also, _it seems just a<br /><br />\nr fit<br /><br />\nv iernarnese<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nanu<br /><br />\nThe fat can get fatter.

On the basis of that,<br />\nit was a surprise when French<br />\nwas only named to the attack of<br />\nlast year's Third All-American<br />\nteam. \"French was good last year<br />\nand he'll get better,\" noted<br />\nCornell Coach Richie Moran.<br />\nFrench is having another fine<br />\nseason with 28 goals so tar.

The Green<br />\nTerror four bagger made it final<br />\nat 5-1.<br />\nThe nightcap opened for<br />\nHopkins with Pedroni leading off<br />\nwith a walk. He stole second,<br /><br />\nmoved to third on a single by<br />\nDave Emala, and scored on a<br />\nwixd pitch. Hopkins added two<br />\ntallies in the third.

Freshman Rich<br />\nNomady, a ranked Junior Davis<br />\nCupper, led his varsity teammates<br />\nJeff Gould, John Newman,<br />\nChuck .McCulloch, Gary<br />\nSwimmer and Kevin Little to the<br />\nvictory. Winning the doubles<br />\nwere teams Newman-McCulloch,<br />\nGould-Swimmer, Little and<br />\nvarsity replacement Jeremy<br />\nLevin.<br />\nBeginning the season with a '<br />\nslow start the Blue Jays dropped.<br />\ntheir first and third matches to<br />\nSalisbury State and Swarthmore<br />\nby the scores of 3-6 and 2-7,<br />\nrespectively. Against Salisbury,<br />\nvictories were amassed by .<br />\nnumber one started Rich<br />\nNomady, Chuck McCulloch at<br />\nfourth singles, and the third<br />\ndoubles combination of Chuck<br />\nMcCulloch and Waterman. Later,<br />\nSwarthmore saw Nomady and<br />\nthe number one doubles team of<br />\nNomady and John Newman<br />\ndonating the pair of victories.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' second match<br />\nwas against Gettysburg where<br />\nthey won 8-1. Winning in singles<br />\nwere Nomady, Jeff Gould,<br />\nNewman, Waterman and<br />\nSwimmer. Hopkins swept the<br />\ndoubles matches, teaming<br />\nN omady-Newman,<br />\nG ould -Swimmer, and<br />\nWaterman-McCulloch.<br />\nFollowing spring break, the<br />\nteam faced a number of setbacks<br />\nwith the loss of starters Mark<br />\nUnis and Fred Waterman. In their<br />\nnext match they succumbed to<br />\nthe strength of Delaware's team<br />\nand the 40 mile per hour winds<br />\nbehind them, losing 1-8. The sole<br />\nvictor for Hopkins was Jeff<br />\nGould at second singles who<br />\noverpowered his opponent 705,<br />\n6-0. The tide finally turned for<br />\nthe Hopkins netmen with<br /><br />\nvictories over Catholic University<br />\nand Loyola College last week by<br />\nscores 6-3 and 5-4. Over Catholic<br />\nUniversity, three of the four<br />\nsingles victories were hard-won in<br />\nthree sets in favor of Nomady,<br />\nGould, and Little, with only<br />\njunior Gary Swimmer winning in<br />\nstraight sets. Doubles wins came<br />\nfrom Nomady\u2014newman and<br />\nMcCulloch-Little who exploded<br />\nto a 6-1, 6-1 victory.<br />\nLoyola was undoubtedly the<br />\nmost exciting and hair-raising<br />\nmatch for the Hopkin:<br />\nracqueteers. Close rivals for the<br />\npast few years, Hopkins edged<br />\nout a 5-4 victory. Tied at<br />\nthree-all at the end of the singles,<br />\nthanks to victors Newman,<br />\nSwimmer and McCulloch, all eyes<br />\nwere on the doubles. A first<br />\ndoubles loss followed by a<br />\nvictory for the third doubles<br />\nteam of McCulloch-Little, kept<br />\nthe match even as<br />\nGould-Swimmer's deciding match<br />\nwent into its third set and<br />\ndarkness set in. In almost total<br />\ndarkness and bitter cold the set<br />\nwent down to the wire but<br />\nHopkins won the tie-breaker 5-2<br />\nand, with that, the entire match.<br />\nLast Saturday the tennis team<br />\nmet Haverford at home and was<br />\ndisappointed by this unexpected<br />\nloss. Rich Nomady won in three<br />\nsets as did Kevin Little at fifth<br />\nsingles while third singles player,<br />\nJmhn Newman rounded out the<br />\nHopkins victories. The final<br />\nscore: 3-6.<br />\nOn Monday, Hopkins took a<br />\nbad beating from the perennially<br />\npowerful University of Maryland<br />\n(currently 22-0) led by John<br />\nLucas. Rich Nomady made it a<br />\nclose match in front of the<br />\nlargest crowd in recent years at<br />\nthe Homewood courts.<br />\nThe Blue Jays played Westerr<br />\nMaryland on Wednesday and<br />\ncame home 7-2 victors. Rich<br />\nNomady again won at first singles<br />\n(3-6, 6-1, 6-1). Jeff Gould (6-1<br /><br />\n6-1), John Newman (6-1,6-2) and<br />\nChuck McCulloch (6-1, 6-4) were<br />\nall singles winners.
