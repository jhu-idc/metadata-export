Being one of<br />\nthese Okies himself, Guthrie's<br />\ndust-bowl songs are all based<br />\non personal experiences and<br />\nfirst-hand observations:<br />\nWas a-farmin' on the share and<br />\nalways I was poor;<br />\nMy crops I laid into the Banker's<br />\nstore;<br />\nMy wife took down and died<br />\nupon the cabin floor,<br />\nAnd I ain't got no home in this<br />\nworld anymore.<br />\nTaylor said that \"aside from<br />\nhis political songs, Guthrie wrote<br />\nsome of the greatest songs for<br />\nchildren that were ever penned...they are still sung in elementary schools and on shows<br />\nlike Captain Kangeroo and Sesame Street\":<br />\nI went to the dance and the<br />\nanimals come....<br />\nMama rat took off her hat,<br />\nShook the house with the old<br />\nTom cat,<br />\nThe alligator beat his tail on the<br />\ndrum,<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n<br />\nSCApproves 1979-80 SAC Budgets,<br />\nDecidesTo Fund Teams Once More<br />\nBY GAYLE COHEN<br />\n<br />\nThe budget allocations proposed by the Student Activities<br />\nCommission (SAC) for SAC<br />\ngroups were approved by the<br />\nStudent Council Wednesday<br />\nnight with only minor changes.<br />\nThe budget totals $90,000,<br />\na sharp reduction from the<br />\ncurrent year's $108,000. According to Robert Fink, Student<br />\nCouncil (SC) treasurer and SAC<br />\nChairman, this cut will not<br />\neliminate any necessary student<br />\nactivities, but only trim superfluous expenses from clubs'<br />\nbudgets. The SAC Executive<br />\nBoard voted March 5 to voluntarily decrease its budget in<br />\norder to help ease the University's deficit.<br />\nThis is the first SAC budget<br />\nto officially include the idea of<br />\nseed money. Fink explained that<br />\nunder this concept, the SAC<br />\nawards a specific amount of<br />\nmoney to a group which has the<br />\npoetential to make profits. At<br />\nthe end of the year, the group<br />\nmust return the original allotment, or seed money, from its<br />\nprofits.<br />\nThe Barnstormers' budget is<br />\n$5155, of which $2000 is seed<br />\nmoney. The Spring Fair, which<br />\nhas been unofficially operating<br />\non a seed money basis for<br />\napproximately a year, will get<br />\n$3000 next year, all of which is<br />\nseed money. The Student Council Social Committee will receive<br />\n$6000, all of which must be paid<br />\nback.<br />\nStudent Council Social<br />\nCommittee Chairman Bill Carlson spoke out against putting<br />\nthe Social Committee on a seed<br />\nmoney operation. He said that<br />\nonly one Social Committee<br />\nevent made money this year,<br />\napproximately one third broke<br />\neven, and the remainder lost<br />\nmoney. He feels that the Social<br />\n<br />\nCommittee will be afraid to plan<br />\nsocial events, which may lose<br />\nmoney, thus severely curtailing<br />\nthe number of campus social<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nCarlson cited Goucher,<br />\nwhose Social Committee works<br />\non seed money, as an example<br />\nof the failure of that concept.<br />\nHe said, \"They have to make<br />\nmoney. They are terrified of<br />\nhaving events, because they<br />\nmight lose money.\" He noted<br />\nthat the high cost of social<br />\nactivities there lowers attendance.<br />\nOther major discussion centered on the feasability of<br />\nfunding competitive teams as<br />\nwell as clubs. The SAC ntrmally<br />\nfunds only campus-based clubs.<br />\nFink explained the issue is<br />\nwhether SAC money should be<br />\nused primarily on this campus<br />\nor used to support esoteric<br />\ncampus groups in activities held<br />\noff-campus.<br />\nHowever, the SAC has been<br />\nfunding the Debate Council<br />\nwhich engages in competitive<br />\ntournaments. The Chess Club<br />\ntherefore petitioned the Student<br />\nCouncil to allow the SAC to<br />\nunderwrite its competitions, indicating that it has as much a<br />\nright to SAC funds for competition as the Debate Council does,<br />\nand also that the Chess Club is<br />\nless expensive.<br />\nSC President George Connolly admitted, \"The Debate<br />\nCouncil is indeed an inconsistency. We're not going to<br />\ntolerate it much longer...but<br />\nwe can't just cut it off totally....<br />\nBut because we've made one<br />\nmistake doesn't mean we should<br />\nmake another,\" he added, showing his opposition to SAC<br />\nfunding for competitive chess.<br />\nThe Student Council nonetheless voted to grant the Chess<br />\nClub $400 for next year.<br />\nIn addition, it voted to give<br />\n<br />\n$5705 to the Debate Council.<br />\nThe debators would have received the entire $6550 they<br />\noriginally requested, the largest<br />\nbudget granted by the SAC, but<br />\nthe SC reduced that amount by<br />\n$845 because the debators needed that sum to attend national<br />\ndebating finals. The SC voted 13<br />\nto 2, with one abstention, to<br />\ngive the debators the necessary<br />\nmoney from the contingency<br />\nfund, but to cut its next year's<br />\nbudget by an equal amount.<br />\nConnolly announced that he<br />\n<br />\nwill work during the summer to<br />\nfind alternative administration<br />\nsources to fund the debators.<br />\nThe Council then approved<br />\nthe remainder of the SAC's<br />\nproposals for next year's SAC<br />\nbudgets. The Undergraduate Science Bulletin and Letters and<br />\nPapers in the Social Sciences will<br />\nbe funded from the contingency<br />\nfund because they have not yet<br />\nchosen their editors for next<br />\nyear.

Every year, it<br />\nranks as one of the most ambitious accomplishments<br />\nachieved by Hopkins students.<br />\nFor the Spring Fair is an injection of real world into<br />\nwhat is otherwise an isolated bubble, the Hopkins community. Thousands of Baltimoreans will pour over our<br />\ngrounds, usually such a sacrosanct and sheltered island of<br />\nacademia.<br />\nAnd not only does the Fair admit outside people to the<br />\nHopkins world, it also introduces Hopkins people to the<br />\noutside world. Spring Fair at its core is pure hoopla, the<br />\nkind of commercial spectacle America is all about. It gives<br />\nthe talented students who run it an invaluable chance to<br />\npractice their business skills and to learn many things they<br />\nnever could if limited to the theoretical environment of<br />\n.the classroom.<br />\nThose of us who are not immersed in the grand marketplace of the Fair can still consider ourselves quite fortunate--we can relax and enjoy it. Don't worry-- we won't<br />\nscare off the paying guests.<br />\n<br />\n1 letters to the editor I<br />\nWho?<br />\n\u2022 To the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nThis letter is directed to<br />\nWeibel Palade who responded to<br />\nour letter concerning the small<br />\npercentage of Hopkins undergraduates accepted at the medical school. We have evaluated<br />\nourselves and other members of<br />\nthe undergraduate community<br />\nand find many students who are<br />\nwell rounded. Unfortunately,<br />\nfrom what we have observed, we<br />\ndoubt that this has been one of<br />\nthe major criteria, why have the<br />\nstudents who have been accepted from Hopkins in previous<br />\nyears been so conspicuously<br />\nlimited in their interests?<br />\nWe have tried to contact<br />\nyou to discuss this matter.<br />\nUnfortunately, the medical<br />\nschool has no listing of a first<br />\nyear student named Weibel<br />\nPalade.

As a common courtNobody should be timid, because the Worst thing that esy we expect an answer to the<br />\ncould happen would be for the session to be dominated by basic question, \"Why is Hopkins<br />\nMedical School neglecting its<br />\nthe ideas of a few crackpots.<br />\nHowever, the student review committee should not own undergraduates?\"<br />\n<br />\nCome Contribute<br />\n<br />\nfeel obligated to express all the viewpoints aired during the<br />\nforum in its report. Much more effectiveness will be<br />\nachieved if one or two issues of the highest importance and<br />\ngeneral concern can be isolated and hammered home in the<br />\nstudent presentation. Only then will student input avoid<br />\nbeing swallowed and forgotten by the faculty members<br />\nwho will have the final say in the review.<br />\n<br />\nSecretary Salute<br />\nNext week is National Secretaries Week, when many<br />\nHopkins secretaries will receive tokens of respect and<br />\nappreciation that they merit year round. Secretaries<br />\nperform essential administrative functions without which<br />\nthe University would quickly grind to a halt. They do<br />\nmassive amounts of paperwork, supervise departmental<br />\nand administrative offices, and provide undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students with information and encouragement.<br />\nAnd, because they have no concrete job description,<br />\nsecretaries are often required to do time-consuming<br />\npersonal favors for their bosses. Thursday, the Women's<br />\nCenter and the GRO are sponsoring a National Secretaries<br />\nDa\\ luncheon in honor of Hopkins secretaries. So all good<br />\nbosses around Homewood will provide flowers for their<br />\nsecretaries next week.

Dr. Godenne was quoted as advising<br />\nwomen that, with regard to<br />\ncombining career and family<br />\ngoals, it's possible to \"have both<br />\neven if this involves some<br />\nsacrifices.\" This was for me a<br />\nreminder of how far the women's movement has yet to go.<br />\nThe expectation is still there<br />\nthat women will bear the brunt<br />\nof child-rearing; men are certainly not admonished to recognize<br />\nthe sacrifices required to cornbine work and family.<br />\nI know a number of men<br />\nwho question the masculine<br />\nstereotype and profess a desire<br />\nto be more involved with children and domestic life \u2014 who<br />\nwould welcome a change in<br />\n<br />\nsocial values and structures that<br />\nwould permit them to do this.<br />\nBut most feel they haven't the<br />\ntime and commitment to be<br />\nleaders in trying to make the<br />\nchanges needed. If men will not<br />\nlead in this, then it's up to<br />\nwomen to present the issues and<br />\npress for solutions - such as<br />\nflextime, greater availability of<br />\npart-time work with equal status<br />\nto fulltime, flexible career paths,<br />\netc. The alternative is a continuation of the double standard<br />\nwhich inevitably disadvantages<br />\nwomen professionally while it<br />\ncuts men off from a rich source<br />\nof experience and satisfaction.<br />\nJudy Morgan<br />\n<br />\nperformed, too, although most<br />\nof their symphonies are not<br />\nquite such standard literature.<br />\nA student cannot consider<br />\nhimself educated if he is mit<br />\nprepared by graduation time for<br />\nthe job market.

RE: Dr. Lowens' Letter:<br />\nUnless there is someone around<br />\nwhom I don't know, the letterwriter to whom he is referring is<br />\nEdward H. Ben, not Beu, as was<br />\nprinted in the original letter<br />\nfrom Mr. Ben.<br />\n<br />\nNew Notes? Prepare<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a present student and a<br />\nmember of the Peabody Symphony Orchestra, I would like<br />\nto comment on Dr. Gaber's<br />\nletter regarding the complaints<br />\nabout the P.S.O.<br />\nWhile conservatories of<br />\nmusic have often been known<br />\nfor their ultra conservatism of<br />\nmusical taste (and Peabody has<br />\nbeen no exception), exploration<br />\nof 20th century music should<br />\nnot displace the study of the<br />\n\"old warhorses,\" those pieces<br />\nthat are played constantly.<br />\nSince Dr. Gaber is apparently<br />\nnot a current practicing professional musician, she might not<br />\nbe fully aware that the pieces<br />\nthat personnel managers and<br />\nconductors want to hear when<br />\nauditioning applicants for positions in symphony orchestras are<br />\nthe \"old warhorses.\" I have<br />\nbefore me now a repertoire list<br />\nfor an audition in a medium-quality symphony orchestra. There<br />\nare 15 selections listed, 12 of<br />\nwhich are very basic pieces, with<br />\nthe other three being less frequently heard, but still well-known. The latest piece was<br />\nwritten in 1930. Of these 15<br />\npieces, I know of four that have<br />\nat least been read through,<br />\nwith only two actually being<br />\nperformed in concert, in the<br />\nfour years I have attended<br />\nPeabody. Of course, other warhorses have been performed in<br />\nthat time, but the average is still<br />\npoor. Take, for example, the<br />\nnumber of symphonies of the<br />\nfollowing composers that have<br />\nbeen played at Peabody in the<br />\npast four years (this is from<br />\nmemory, so I may be off by one<br />\nor two): Brahms--1 out of 4<br />\nwritten; Beethoven--2 out of 9;<br />\nMahler--2 out of 9; Schubert--1<br />\nout of 9; Bruckner-0 out of 9.<br />\nA couple each of Haydn and<br />\nMozart symphonies have been<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI write this letter not so<br />\nmuch as to take issue with<br />\nRobin Gaber's view of the<br />\nPeabody Orchestra situation but<br />\nrather to present another view of<br />\nit as it is still far from being<br />\nsettled. Having a degree in music<br />\nand knowing many members of<br />\nthe orchestra, I undertand the<br />\nfactors involved and the feelings<br />\nof both sides involved.<br />\nGranted it is an injustice to<br />\ncall Dr. Prausnitz \"incompetent\"; any person who can tackle<br />\nthe rigors of twentieth-century<br />\nscores is far from being so. Also,<br />\nan orchestra should not rely on a<br />\nhandful of war-horses to carry<br />\neach season. However, it is not<br />\nas simple a matter as being<br />\nprogressive or not.<br />\nOne perspective to be examined is that of the students'. The<br />\nPeabody Conservatory of Music<br />\nis first and foremost an educational institution and being such<br />\nits primary purpose is to train<br />\nmusicians and prepare them for<br />\nthe job market. It cannot<br />\neffectively train musicians if it<br />\nlaunches them immediately into<br />\nthe ultra-complex world of contemporary music without having<br />\ntread the traditional ground of<br />\nearlier works; many have not<br />\neven heard all nine of Beethoven's symphonies. To push<br />\nahead without the basic training<br />\nis a rash act of impatience<br />\nand can only result in a poor<br />\ntechnique with the result of this<br />\nbeing insufficiently<br />\ntrained<br />\nmusicians competing with thoroughly trained ones. Thus, the<br />\nteachers and administrators gain<br />\nthe prestige of being \"trail-blazers\" while the young musicians<br />\nsuffer.<br />\nA second perspective to<br />\nexamine is that of the bulk of<br />\nmusic being championed by the<br />\nconductor and his supporters.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 5<br />\n..11.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1kb<br />\n<br />\n(lb<br />\n<br />\n11. \u2022 \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\"BEST FOREIGN FILM<br />\nFrom<br />\nYou<br />\nTo<br />\nUsi<br />\nMore<br />\nOF THE YEAR\"<br />\n<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nModern music as defined here is<br />\nnot simply music being written<br />\nin the 20th century; it is music<br />\ndeliberately made so complex,<br />\nso pedantic or so chaotic that<br />\nit will alienate a vast proportion<br />\nof its audience (recall Arnold<br />\nSchoberg's statement: \"If it's<br />\nart, it's not for everybody\".<br />\nHow magnanimous.). Not all<br />\nmodern composers write with<br />\nthe integrity and humanism of<br />\nStravinsky, Copland, Bartok or<br />\nBritten. Some actually go about<br />\nit in a spiteful and condescending manner. To sit through an<br />\nentire concert of their creations<br />\nhas not only a depressing effect<br />\non the audience but doubly so<br />\non those performing it. Thus,<br />\nmorale also enters ,the student<br />\nproblem.<br />\nAlso, music is not automatically good because it was<br />\nwritten by an American. Although it produced much beautiful work in the last century,<br />\nnationalism should have a minimal influence on the arts in this<br />\npresent age. Strangely, this outdated practice seems okay in the<br />\neyes of the hierarchy.<br />\nMusic is to be enjoyed or it<br />\nfails its purpose. It should not be<br />\nmanipulated for political or<br />\npersonal motivations. Lastly,<br />\nthere is no reason why Mozart,<br />\nSchumann and Tchaikovsky<br />\ncannot co-exist with Wevern,<br />\nIves and Gunther Schuller.

Schmith, to be either<br />\nuncooperative or inadequate.<br />\nBut their behavior tells us<br />\nsomething more, something crucial and saddening about the<br />\nAdministration's politics. Allow<br />\nme to explain.<br />\nIt is obvious that the<br />\nAdministration does not consider sexual assaults against women<br />\na serious offense. For example,<br />\nthe woman student had to insist.<br />\non being taken to the police.<br />\nFurthermore, the alleged offender is being treated with an<br />\nalarming nonchalance. He is out<br />\non bail, free to roam the campus<br />\nand the library, and has received<br />\nno punishment more serious<br />\nthan a suggestion that he seek<br />\npsychiatric help.<br />\nOther realities of campus<br />\nlife confirm the impression of<br />\nthe Administration's cavalier attitude toward Hopkins' female<br />\nstudents. Why, for example, is<br />\nthe Hopkins garage neither welllit nor patrolled? And why<br />\n<br />\naren't there peep-holes in the<br />\ndoors<br />\nof<br />\nuniversityowned<br />\napartment buildings?<br />\nSuch<br />\nsafety measures are neither extreme nor difficult to provicteyet we don't have them.<br />\nThe implication is clearly<br />\nthat the safety and emotional<br />\nwell-being of Hopkins women is<br />\nnot very important to University<br />\nofficials. Why else would this<br />\nwoman have been \"urged\" not<br />\nto prosecute the alleged offender? Why are the feelings of one<br />\ndisturbed individual being taken<br />\ninto account while the right of<br />\nwomen students as a group to<br />\nfeel safe is being ignored?<br />\nSurely we deserve to work in<br />\nsafety, and to feel that the<br />\nlibrary and the rest of campus<br />\nare not areas of potential danger<br />\nor disturbance.<br />\nAnalysis should also be<br />\ndirected at the treatment received by the young woman in<br />\nquestion. She obviously conducted herself in a calm and<br />\nresponsible manner, for which<br />\nshe deserves all of our respect.<br />\nJust think-had she gotten agitated, she would have been judged<br />\n\"hysterical,\" and her justified<br />\nupset would have been dismissed. Yet her calmness only<br />\nprovoked the Administration to<br />\nuse the other edge of the traditional weapon of dismissal used<br />\non women. Since she remained<br />\ncalm, she was judged as \"not<br />\n'traumatized,\" and that became<br />\nthe basis on which her feelings<br />\nwere dismissed. She was told in<br />\nessence not to make a fuss--a<br />\nversion of the standard advice to<br />\nwomen to be seen and not<br />\nheard. Such advice and the<br />\nattitudes behind it are exactly<br />\nthose which create and perpetuate women's passivity and sense<br />\nof powerlessness--i.e., precisely<br />\nthose qualities which encourage<br />\nsexual offenders to perpetrate<br />\ncrimes against women.<br />\nIt is not as though nothing<br />\ncould be done. If flashing or<br />\nany other form of sexual assault<br />\nhas been frequent on campus, as<br />\nyou have reported it is, we<br />\ndeserve to know, and we deserve<br />\nto be protected. In this instance, memoranda should have<br />\nbeen posted in the library<br />\nalerting us to the presence of the<br />\nflasher, and giving a list of<br />\ninstructions on what to do<br />\nif you are harassed by hiniwhom to notify, etc. Furthermore, a security officer should<br />\nbe present on C-Level, and/or a<br />\nlibrary employee should be<br />\nstationed where the offense<br />\noccurred to prevent a repeat<br />\nattack. And needless to say, the<br />\nalleged offender should not only<br />\nbe prosecuted but immediately<br />\nexpelled from the University.<br />\nThe Administration owes<br />\nHopkins women a lot of answers. A copy of this letter<br />\nto the editor of the News-Letter<br />\nis being sent to Director of<br />\nStudent Services Albert T.<br />\nSchmith, to Security Manager<br />\nRobert Larkin, to Dean of<br />\nStudents Jakie Hall, and to<br />\nPresident Steven Muller. I urge<br />\nthe recipients of this letter to<br />\nanswer the Hopkins community<br />\npublicly, through the NewsLetter.<br />\nThe most frightening aspect<br />\nof this incident of sexual assault<br />\n<br />\nlies not in the nature of this<br />\nincident itself, but in the way<br />\nthe Administration has dealt<br />\nwith it. It is terrifying to realize<br />\nthat University officials are<br />\nunresponsive to a fundamental<br />\nstudent need. The compassion of<br />\nDirector of Student Services<br />\nSchmith, although appreciated,<br />\nis not what is called for, is not<br />\nwhat is appropriate to deal with<br />\nthis issue.

We'll bet most students wouldn't guess the Debate<br />\nCouncil. The Debate Council is<br />\nreceiving $6550 next year as<br />\ncompared to, for example,<br />\n$2690 for the Course Guide,<br />\n$2775 for the BSU, and $1800<br />\nfor Zeniada. The Debate Council<br />\nreceives more money than any<br />\nSAC funded group except the<br />\nMSE Symposium (S10,000).<br />\nWhat is this $6550 used for?<br />\nAlmost entirely to pay the hotel<br />\nbill and transportation costs of a<br />\ngroup of 8-12 students who fly<br />\naround the country to participate in 5-10 debate tournaments<br />\nper year. It seems to us that SAC<br />\nfunds could be better allocated<br />\nso as to benefit more students. It<br />\nis certainly difficult to defend<br />\nthat the Debate Council benefits<br />\nstudents more than any other<br />\ncam pus organization.<br />\nIn - fairness, the SAC has<br />\nbeen attempting to phase out all<br />\n\"team\" activities which require<br />\ntransportation and lodging expenses, and benefit only a small<br />\ngroup of students. Unfortunately, the SAC has applied a double<br />\nstandard to evaluate such groups. While the modest budgets of a<br />\nnumber of student teams were<br />\nno longer funded, the outlandish<br />\nDebate Council budget was not<br />\nonly funded but increased by<br />\n$200 over last year. Surely this<br />\nis not SAC Chairman Bob Fink's<br />\nidea of \"conservative spending<br />\nfor activities,\" in a year when<br />\ntotal SAC funds were slashed<br />\n11%.

Reservations helpful during the week,<br />\nnecessary on weekends.<br />\nSabatino's may not be easy to find if you've never<br />\nbeen there before, nestled as it is in a maze of narrow<br />\nstreets within the district near the Inner Harbor known<br />\nas Little Italy. But if you get anywhere close, you<br />\nshould be able to follow your nose the rest of the way,<br />\nfor in '- evenings an aroma of garlic hangs over the<br />\nwho],<br />\nghborhood.<br />\narea around Sabatino's, the walls of several<br />\nbuil,<br />\n' are festooned with Roman-style illusionistic<br />\nmurals. Many of the eating establishments there too<br />\npresent merely the illusion of being islands of true<br />\nItalian culture, and in some ways Sabatino's is no<br />\nexception. The paper-napkin dispensers located on the<br />\nsides of the table betray its true identity, a disguised but<br />\ndistant cousin of the American diner. The customers<br />\nwho look and dress 100% American make Sabatino's a<br />\nfamily-style place, bustling and noisy. The interior is<br />\nbrightly lit., which keeps it from being romantic, and<br />\nthe decor is unremarkable, although not tacky.<br />\nThe best thing about Sabatino's is that no one goes<br />\nhome hungry. The portions are so enormous that a<br />\npatron might be well-advised to fast 24 hours before<br />\nindulging in a meal there. The selection is also wide<br />\nenough and the prices low enough so that a complete<br />\ndinner for two could cost anything from as little as $12<br />\nup. A good idea might be to get an antipasto salad<br />\n($2.50), large enough for two people to share. Coupled<br />\nwith a pasta dish, half of this appetizer is enough to<br />\nmake a full meal.<br />\nThe antipasto, compsed of lettuce, olives, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, salami, and anchovies, was served<br />\nwith the house dressing, a standard Italian mix made a<br />\n<br />\nbit overpowering by the presence of parmesan cheese.<br />\nThe list of appetizers also includes several seafood<br />\nchoices. One we tried, clams on the half shell ($1.25),<br />\nlacked tast but were improved by a spicy horseradish<br />\nand tomato sauce.<br />\nThe pasta dish we ordered, Fettucine Alfredo, was<br />\nwell-prepared. It took its flavor from a rich parmesan<br />\ncheese and cream sauce which made the noodles rather<br />\nheavy and rapidly filling. A Chicken Cacciatore entree,<br />\npriced like other poultry and meat selections in the $7<br />\nrange, was an even greater challenge to finish. Over half<br />\na chicken was bathed in a tasty tomato sauce made thick<br />\nwith mushrooms. The meat itself was acceptable but<br />\nreally nothing special--the tast of the sauce didn't seep<br />\ninto the meat. The dish was accompanied by some<br />\nrather ordinary spaghetti, again saved by the fine sauce.<br />\nThe desserts were a disappointment. A small piece<br />\nof cheesecake also turned out to be rather bland. We<br />\ntried their tortoni ($1.00), a liquor-spiced Italian ice<br />\ncream, which offended our delicate sensibilities when it<br />\nwas served in a tiny paper cup. This was a give-away<br />\nthat the dessert was pre-packaged, and it tasted it, as the<br />\nliquer was hardly noticeable. But the expresso coffee,<br />\nseived in its own pot, was quite good.<br />\nThe service was friendly and quick, in fact if anything too quick. There was little time to relax between<br />\ncourses, but perhaps this was just another manifestation<br />\nof the American rather than European character of this<br />\nrestaurant.<br />\nSabatino's has a wide selection of Italian and<br />\nAmerican wines at moderate prices. A Ruffino Chianti,<br />\nfull-bodied and smooth, made a good accompaniment<br />\nfor our meal. Like most on the list, it was priced at<br />\n$3.50 for a half-bottle. We paid $26.00, tip included,<br />\nfor a plentiful dinner, but you could get by with a lot<br />\nless if you go to Sabatino's. You might not be persuaded that you're back in the Old Country, but your<br />\nstomach will at least go home happy.<br />\n<br />\n1..mmilmesr<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nThe Senior<br />\nClass Film Series<br />\nPresents<br />\n<br />\nPIT<br />\n<br />\nSTOP<br />\n<br />\n,'<br />\n<br />\nOIL<br />\n<br />\nCHANGE,\u00a9<br />\nWBE, OIL & FILTER<br />\n<br />\nMEW<br />\n<br />\nMOST<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\n<br />\nFriday: 7, 9, & 11 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nGo see thefireworks!<br />\n<br />\n10 MINUTE<br />\nOUR ONLY BUSINESS<br />\n<br />\nWITH A PERFORMANCE:<br />\nBY LINDA RONSTADT<br />\n<br />\nSaturday: 7, & 11 p.m.<br />\nNO 9 p.m. show<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nHome of the<br />\n<br />\nAdmission: $1.00<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\n$1095<br />\n<br />\nFEATURING<br />\nPENNZOIL<br />\n1 OW-40<br />\n<br />\nPLUS<br />\nFOREIGN<br />\nTAX<br />\nCARS<br />\nPLUS FREE UNDERHOOD RUM CHKX<br />\n<br />\n1025 WEST 41st ST. 235-6336<br />\nBETWEEN FALLS ROAD & ROLAND AVENUE<br />\nV4 MILE WEST OF ROTUNDA MALL<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 13<br />\n<br />\n\"I've gotPabst Blue Ribbon on my mind.\"<br />\naiveritt\u00b001k161NA,LfiAtgeutAtionke<br />\n\"WES()WREST PROOLIC TS PROVI DIE ITS PRIZED RAW<br />\nONLY THE FINEST OF HOPS AND GRAINS ARE USED<br />\n<br />\njgctedadjinteukaeat in. 1893<br />\n<br />\n(Pabg<br />\nBlue Ribbon<br />\nEE<br />\n;<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n,C 1979 PABST BREWING COMPANY, ?vi1waukee..V./141(s and t4ther<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 I APRIL 20, 1979<br />\n<br />\nWhite's Second Novel<br />\n<br />\nA Complete Achievement<br />\nNocturnes for the King of Naples, by<br />\nEdmund White. 148 pages.

Guthrie thought that<br />\nAmerica was the greatest country in the world, but that did not<br />\nprohibit his from pointing out<br />\nits flaws.\"<br />\nDuring the show Taylor will<br />\npresent some of Guthrie's work<br />\non the \"Dust Bowl Refugees\":<br />\nmidwestern \"Okies\" who were<br />\ndriven off their farms in the<br />\n1930's because of dust storms<br />\nand greedy bankers, and who<br />\ntraveled west to California to<br /><br />\nsearch for work as migrant<br />\nlaborers.

According to Robert Fink, Student<br />\nCouncil (SC) treasurer and SAC<br />\nChairman, this cut will not<br />\neliminate any necessary student<br />\nactivities, but only trim superfluous expenses from clubs'<br />\nbudgets. The SAC Executive<br />\nBoard voted March 5 to voluntarily decrease its budget in<br />\norder to help ease the University's deficit.<br />\nThis is the first SAC budget<br />\nto officially include the idea of<br />\nseed money. Fink explained that<br />\nunder this concept, the SAC<br />\nawards a specific amount of<br />\nmoney to a group which has the<br />\npoetential to make profits. At<br />\nthe end of the year, the group<br />\nmust return the original allotment, or seed money, from its<br />\nprofits.<br />\nThe Barnstormers' budget is<br />\n$5155, of which $2000 is seed<br />\nmoney. The Spring Fair, which<br />\nhas been unofficially operating<br />\non a seed money basis for<br />\napproximately a year, will get<br />\n$3000 next year, all of which is<br />\nseed money. The Student Council Social Committee will receive<br />\n$6000, all of which must be paid<br />\nback.<br />\nStudent Council Social<br />\nCommittee Chairman Bill Carlson spoke out against putting<br />\nthe Social Committee on a seed<br />\nmoney operation. He said that<br />\nonly one Social Committee<br />\nevent made money this year,<br />\napproximately one third broke<br />\neven, and the remainder lost<br />\nmoney. He feels that the Social<br /><br />\nCommittee will be afraid to plan<br />\nsocial events, which may lose<br />\nmoney, thus severely curtailing<br />\nthe number of campus social<br />\nfunctions.<br />\nCarlson cited Goucher,<br />\nwhose Social Committee works<br />\non seed money, as an example<br />\nof the failure of that concept.<br />\nHe said, \"They have to make<br />\nmoney. They are terrified of<br />\nhaving events, because they<br />\nmight lose money.\" He noted<br />\nthat the high cost of social<br />\nactivities there lowers attendance.<br />\nOther major discussion centered on the feasability of<br />\nfunding competitive teams as<br />\nwell as clubs. The SAC ntrmally<br />\nfunds only campus-based clubs.<br />\nFink explained the issue is<br />\nwhether SAC money should be<br />\nused primarily on this campus<br />\nor used to support esoteric<br />\ncampus groups in activities held<br />\noff-campus.<br />\nHowever, the SAC has been<br />\nfunding the Debate Council<br />\nwhich engages in competitive<br />\ntournaments. The Chess Club<br />\ntherefore petitioned the Student<br />\nCouncil to allow the SAC to<br />\nunderwrite its competitions, indicating that it has as much a<br />\nright to SAC funds for competition as the Debate Council does,<br />\nand also that the Chess Club is<br />\nless expensive.<br />\nSC President George Connolly admitted, \"The Debate<br />\nCouncil is indeed an inconsistency. We're not going to<br />\ntolerate it much longer...but<br />\nwe can't just cut it off totally....<br />\nBut because we've made one<br />\nmistake doesn't mean we should<br />\nmake another,\" he added, showing his opposition to SAC<br />\nfunding for competitive chess.<br />\nThe Student Council nonetheless voted to grant the Chess<br />\nClub $400 for next year.<br />\nIn addition, it voted to give<br /><br />\n$5705 to the Debate Council.<br />\nThe debators would have received the entire $6550 they<br />\noriginally requested, the largest<br />\nbudget granted by the SAC, but<br />\nthe SC reduced that amount by<br />\n$845 because the debators needed that sum to attend national<br />\ndebating finals. The SC voted 13<br />\nto 2, with one abstention, to<br />\ngive the debators the necessary<br />\nmoney from the contingency<br />\nfund, but to cut its next year's<br />\nbudget by an equal amount.<br />\nConnolly announced that he<br /><br />\nwill work during the summer to<br />\nfind alternative administration<br />\nsources to fund the debators.<br />\nThe Council then approved<br />\nthe remainder of the SAC's<br />\nproposals for next year's SAC<br />\nbudgets. The Undergraduate Science Bulletin and Letters and<br />\nPapers in the Social Sciences will<br />\nbe funded from the contingency<br />\nfund because they have not yet<br />\nchosen their editors for next<br />\nyear.

Every year, it<br />\nranks as one of the most ambitious accomplishments<br />\nachieved by Hopkins students.<br />\nFor the Spring Fair is an injection of real world into<br />\nwhat is otherwise an isolated bubble, the Hopkins community. Thousands of Baltimoreans will pour over our<br />\ngrounds, usually such a sacrosanct and sheltered island of<br />\nacademia.<br />\nAnd not only does the Fair admit outside people to the<br />\nHopkins world, it also introduces Hopkins people to the<br />\noutside world. Spring Fair at its core is pure hoopla, the<br />\nkind of commercial spectacle America is all about. It gives<br />\nthe talented students who run it an invaluable chance to<br />\npractice their business skills and to learn many things they<br />\nnever could if limited to the theoretical environment of<br />\n.the classroom.<br />\nThose of us who are not immersed in the grand marketplace of the Fair can still consider ourselves quite fortunate--we can relax and enjoy it.

Only then will student input avoid<br />\nbeing swallowed and forgotten by the faculty members<br />\nwho will have the final say in the review.<br /><br />\nSecretary Salute<br />\nNext week is National Secretaries Week, when many<br />\nHopkins secretaries will receive tokens of respect and<br />\nappreciation that they merit year round. Secretaries<br />\nperform essential administrative functions without which<br />\nthe University would quickly grind to a halt. They do<br />\nmassive amounts of paperwork, supervise departmental<br />\nand administrative offices, and provide undergraduate and<br />\ngraduate students with information and encouragement.<br />\nAnd, because they have no concrete job description,<br />\nsecretaries are often required to do time-consuming<br />\npersonal favors for their bosses. Thursday, the Women's<br />\nCenter and the GRO are sponsoring a National Secretaries<br />\nDa\\ luncheon in honor of Hopkins secretaries.

Dr. Godenne was quoted as advising<br />\nwomen that, with regard to<br />\ncombining career and family<br />\ngoals, it's possible to \"have both<br />\neven if this involves some<br />\nsacrifices.\" This was for me a<br />\nreminder of how far the women's movement has yet to go.<br />\nThe expectation is still there<br />\nthat women will bear the brunt<br />\nof child-rearing; men are certainly not admonished to recognize<br />\nthe sacrifices required to cornbine work and family.<br />\nI know a number of men<br />\nwho question the masculine<br />\nstereotype and profess a desire<br />\nto be more involved with children and domestic life \u2014 who<br />\nwould welcome a change in<br /><br />\nsocial values and structures that<br />\nwould permit them to do this.<br />\nBut most feel they haven't the<br />\ntime and commitment to be<br />\nleaders in trying to make the<br />\nchanges needed. If men will not<br />\nlead in this, then it's up to<br />\nwomen to present the issues and<br />\npress for solutions - such as<br />\nflextime, greater availability of<br />\npart-time work with equal status<br />\nto fulltime, flexible career paths,<br />\netc. The alternative is a continuation of the double standard<br />\nwhich inevitably disadvantages<br />\nwomen professionally while it<br />\ncuts men off from a rich source<br />\nof experience and satisfaction.<br />\nJudy Morgan<br /><br />\nperformed, too, although most<br />\nof their symphonies are not<br />\nquite such standard literature.<br />\nA student cannot consider<br />\nhimself educated if he is mit<br />\nprepared by graduation time for<br />\nthe job market.

Ben, not Beu, as was<br />\nprinted in the original letter<br />\nfrom Mr. Ben.<br /><br />\nNew Notes? Prepare<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAs a present student and a<br />\nmember of the Peabody Symphony Orchestra, I would like<br />\nto comment on Dr. Gaber's<br />\nletter regarding the complaints<br />\nabout the P.S.O.<br />\nWhile conservatories of<br />\nmusic have often been known<br />\nfor their ultra conservatism of<br />\nmusical taste (and Peabody has<br />\nbeen no exception), exploration<br />\nof 20th century music should<br />\nnot displace the study of the<br />\n\"old warhorses,\" those pieces<br />\nthat are played constantly.<br />\nSince Dr. Gaber is apparently<br />\nnot a current practicing professional musician, she might not<br />\nbe fully aware that the pieces<br />\nthat personnel managers and<br />\nconductors want to hear when<br />\nauditioning applicants for positions in symphony orchestras are<br />\nthe \"old warhorses.\" I have<br />\nbefore me now a repertoire list<br />\nfor an audition in a medium-quality symphony orchestra. There<br />\nare 15 selections listed, 12 of<br />\nwhich are very basic pieces, with<br />\nthe other three being less frequently heard, but still well-known. The latest piece was<br />\nwritten in 1930. Of these 15<br />\npieces, I know of four that have<br />\nat least been read through,<br />\nwith only two actually being<br />\nperformed in concert, in the<br />\nfour years I have attended<br />\nPeabody. Of course, other warhorses have been performed in<br />\nthat time, but the average is still<br />\npoor. Take, for example, the<br />\nnumber of symphonies of the<br />\nfollowing composers that have<br />\nbeen played at Peabody in the<br />\npast four years (this is from<br />\nmemory, so I may be off by one<br />\nor two): Brahms--1 out of 4<br />\nwritten; Beethoven--2 out of 9;<br />\nMahler--2 out of 9; Schubert--1<br />\nout of 9; Bruckner-0 out of 9.<br />\nA couple each of Haydn and<br />\nMozart symphonies have been<br /><br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI write this letter not so<br />\nmuch as to take issue with<br />\nRobin Gaber's view of the<br />\nPeabody Orchestra situation but<br />\nrather to present another view of<br />\nit as it is still far from being<br />\nsettled. Having a degree in music<br />\nand knowing many members of<br />\nthe orchestra, I undertand the<br />\nfactors involved and the feelings<br />\nof both sides involved.<br />\nGranted it is an injustice to<br />\ncall Dr. Prausnitz \"incompetent\"; any person who can tackle<br />\nthe rigors of twentieth-century<br />\nscores is far from being so. Also,<br />\nan orchestra should not rely on a<br />\nhandful of war-horses to carry<br />\neach season. However, it is not<br />\nas simple a matter as being<br />\nprogressive or not.<br />\nOne perspective to be examined is that of the students'. The<br />\nPeabody Conservatory of Music<br />\nis first and foremost an educational institution and being such<br />\nits primary purpose is to train<br />\nmusicians and prepare them for<br />\nthe job market. It cannot<br />\neffectively train musicians if it<br />\nlaunches them immediately into<br />\nthe ultra-complex world of contemporary music without having<br />\ntread the traditional ground of<br />\nearlier works; many have not<br />\neven heard all nine of Beethoven's symphonies. To push<br />\nahead without the basic training<br />\nis a rash act of impatience<br />\nand can only result in a poor<br />\ntechnique with the result of this<br />\nbeing insufficiently<br />\ntrained<br />\nmusicians competing with thoroughly trained ones. Thus, the<br />\nteachers and administrators gain<br />\nthe prestige of being \"trail-blazers\" while the young musicians<br />\nsuffer.<br />\nA second perspective to<br />\nexamine is that of the bulk of<br />\nmusic being championed by the<br />\nconductor and his supporters.<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER I PAGE 5<br />\n..11.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1kb<br /><br />\n(lb<br /><br />\n11. \u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\"BEST FOREIGN FILM<br />\nFrom<br />\nYou<br />\nTo<br />\nUsi<br />\nMore<br />\nOF THE YEAR\"<br /><br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nModern music as defined here is<br />\nnot simply music being written<br />\nin the 20th century; it is music<br />\ndeliberately made so complex,<br />\nso pedantic or so chaotic that<br />\nit will alienate a vast proportion<br />\nof its audience (recall Arnold<br />\nSchoberg's statement: \"If it's<br />\nart, it's not for everybody\".<br />\nHow magnanimous.). Not all<br />\nmodern composers write with<br />\nthe integrity and humanism of<br />\nStravinsky, Copland, Bartok or<br />\nBritten. Some actually go about<br />\nit in a spiteful and condescending manner. To sit through an<br />\nentire concert of their creations<br />\nhas not only a depressing effect<br />\non the audience but doubly so<br />\non those performing it. Thus,<br />\nmorale also enters ,the student<br />\nproblem.<br />\nAlso, music is not automatically good because it was<br />\nwritten by an American. Although it produced much beautiful work in the last century,<br />\nnationalism should have a minimal influence on the arts in this<br />\npresent age. Strangely, this outdated practice seems okay in the<br />\neyes of the hierarchy.<br />\nMusic is to be enjoyed or it<br />\nfails its purpose.

Schmith, to be either<br />\nuncooperative or inadequate.<br />\nBut their behavior tells us<br />\nsomething more, something crucial and saddening about the<br />\nAdministration's politics. Allow<br />\nme to explain.<br />\nIt is obvious that the<br />\nAdministration does not consider sexual assaults against women<br />\na serious offense. For example,<br />\nthe woman student had to insist.<br />\non being taken to the police.<br />\nFurthermore, the alleged offender is being treated with an<br />\nalarming nonchalance. He is out<br />\non bail, free to roam the campus<br />\nand the library, and has received<br />\nno punishment more serious<br />\nthan a suggestion that he seek<br />\npsychiatric help.<br />\nOther realities of campus<br />\nlife confirm the impression of<br />\nthe Administration's cavalier attitude toward Hopkins' female<br />\nstudents. Why, for example, is<br />\nthe Hopkins garage neither welllit nor patrolled? And why<br /><br />\naren't there peep-holes in the<br />\ndoors<br />\nof<br />\nuniversityowned<br />\napartment buildings?<br />\nSuch<br />\nsafety measures are neither extreme nor difficult to provicteyet we don't have them.<br />\nThe implication is clearly<br />\nthat the safety and emotional<br />\nwell-being of Hopkins women is<br />\nnot very important to University<br />\nofficials. Why else would this<br />\nwoman have been \"urged\" not<br />\nto prosecute the alleged offender? Why are the feelings of one<br />\ndisturbed individual being taken<br />\ninto account while the right of<br />\nwomen students as a group to<br />\nfeel safe is being ignored?<br />\nSurely we deserve to work in<br />\nsafety, and to feel that the<br />\nlibrary and the rest of campus<br />\nare not areas of potential danger<br />\nor disturbance.<br />\nAnalysis should also be<br />\ndirected at the treatment received by the young woman in<br />\nquestion. She obviously conducted herself in a calm and<br />\nresponsible manner, for which<br />\nshe deserves all of our respect.<br />\nJust think-had she gotten agitated, she would have been judged<br />\n\"hysterical,\" and her justified<br />\nupset would have been dismissed. Yet her calmness only<br />\nprovoked the Administration to<br />\nuse the other edge of the traditional weapon of dismissal used<br />\non women. Since she remained<br />\ncalm, she was judged as \"not<br />\n'traumatized,\" and that became<br />\nthe basis on which her feelings<br />\nwere dismissed. She was told in<br />\nessence not to make a fuss--a<br />\nversion of the standard advice to<br />\nwomen to be seen and not<br />\nheard. Such advice and the<br />\nattitudes behind it are exactly<br />\nthose which create and perpetuate women's passivity and sense<br />\nof powerlessness--i.e., precisely<br />\nthose qualities which encourage<br />\nsexual offenders to perpetrate<br />\ncrimes against women.<br />\nIt is not as though nothing<br />\ncould be done. If flashing or<br />\nany other form of sexual assault<br />\nhas been frequent on campus, as<br />\nyou have reported it is, we<br />\ndeserve to know, and we deserve<br />\nto be protected. In this instance, memoranda should have<br />\nbeen posted in the library<br />\nalerting us to the presence of the<br />\nflasher, and giving a list of<br />\ninstructions on what to do<br />\nif you are harassed by hiniwhom to notify, etc. Furthermore, a security officer should<br />\nbe present on C-Level, and/or a<br />\nlibrary employee should be<br />\nstationed where the offense<br />\noccurred to prevent a repeat<br />\nattack. And needless to say, the<br />\nalleged offender should not only<br />\nbe prosecuted but immediately<br />\nexpelled from the University.<br />\nThe Administration owes<br />\nHopkins women a lot of answers. A copy of this letter<br />\nto the editor of the News-Letter<br />\nis being sent to Director of<br />\nStudent Services Albert T.<br />\nSchmith, to Security Manager<br />\nRobert Larkin, to Dean of<br />\nStudents Jakie Hall, and to<br />\nPresident Steven Muller. I urge<br />\nthe recipients of this letter to<br />\nanswer the Hopkins community<br />\npublicly, through the NewsLetter.<br />\nThe most frightening aspect<br />\nof this incident of sexual assault<br /><br />\nlies not in the nature of this<br />\nincident itself, but in the way<br />\nthe Administration has dealt<br />\nwith it. It is terrifying to realize<br />\nthat University officials are<br />\nunresponsive to a fundamental<br />\nstudent need. The compassion of<br />\nDirector of Student Services<br />\nSchmith, although appreciated,<br />\nis not what is called for, is not<br />\nwhat is appropriate to deal with<br />\nthis issue. We need action-we<br />\nneed to be informed, we need to<br />\nbe protected, and we need to<br />\nreceive assurances from the<br />\nAdministration of its concern<br />\nand sensitivity. Such needs are<br />\nin fact our rights, and deserve to<br />\nbe respected.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nGeraldine Q. Ruthchild<br />\nEnglish Department<br />\nP.S.

We'll bet most students wouldn't guess the Debate<br />\nCouncil. The Debate Council is<br />\nreceiving $6550 next year as<br />\ncompared to, for example,<br />\n$2690 for the Course Guide,<br />\n$2775 for the BSU, and $1800<br />\nfor Zeniada. The Debate Council<br />\nreceives more money than any<br />\nSAC funded group except the<br />\nMSE Symposium (S10,000).<br />\nWhat is this $6550 used for?<br />\nAlmost entirely to pay the hotel<br />\nbill and transportation costs of a<br />\ngroup of 8-12 students who fly<br />\naround the country to participate in 5-10 debate tournaments<br />\nper year. It seems to us that SAC<br />\nfunds could be better allocated<br />\nso as to benefit more students. It<br />\nis certainly difficult to defend<br />\nthat the Debate Council benefits<br />\nstudents more than any other<br />\ncam pus organization.<br />\nIn - fairness, the SAC has<br />\nbeen attempting to phase out all<br />\n\"team\" activities which require<br />\ntransportation and lodging expenses, and benefit only a small<br />\ngroup of students. Unfortunately, the SAC has applied a double<br />\nstandard to evaluate such groups. While the modest budgets of a<br />\nnumber of student teams were<br />\nno longer funded, the outlandish<br />\nDebate Council budget was not<br />\nonly funded but increased by<br />\n$200 over last year. Surely this<br />\nis not SAC Chairman Bob Fink's<br />\nidea of \"conservative spending<br />\nfor activities,\" in a year when<br />\ntotal SAC funds were slashed<br />\n11%.

Reservations helpful during the week,<br />\nnecessary on weekends.<br />\nSabatino's may not be easy to find if you've never<br />\nbeen there before, nestled as it is in a maze of narrow<br />\nstreets within the district near the Inner Harbor known<br />\nas Little Italy. But if you get anywhere close, you<br />\nshould be able to follow your nose the rest of the way,<br />\nfor in '- evenings an aroma of garlic hangs over the<br />\nwho],<br />\nghborhood.<br />\narea around Sabatino's, the walls of several<br />\nbuil,<br />\n' are festooned with Roman-style illusionistic<br />\nmurals. Many of the eating establishments there too<br />\npresent merely the illusion of being islands of true<br />\nItalian culture, and in some ways Sabatino's is no<br />\nexception. The paper-napkin dispensers located on the<br />\nsides of the table betray its true identity, a disguised but<br />\ndistant cousin of the American diner. The customers<br />\nwho look and dress 100% American make Sabatino's a<br />\nfamily-style place, bustling and noisy. The interior is<br />\nbrightly lit., which keeps it from being romantic, and<br />\nthe decor is unremarkable, although not tacky.<br />\nThe best thing about Sabatino's is that no one goes<br />\nhome hungry. The portions are so enormous that a<br />\npatron might be well-advised to fast 24 hours before<br />\nindulging in a meal there. The selection is also wide<br />\nenough and the prices low enough so that a complete<br />\ndinner for two could cost anything from as little as $12<br />\nup. A good idea might be to get an antipasto salad<br />\n($2.50), large enough for two people to share. Coupled<br />\nwith a pasta dish, half of this appetizer is enough to<br />\nmake a full meal.<br />\nThe antipasto, compsed of lettuce, olives, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, salami, and anchovies, was served<br />\nwith the house dressing, a standard Italian mix made a<br /><br />\nbit overpowering by the presence of parmesan cheese.<br />\nThe list of appetizers also includes several seafood<br />\nchoices. One we tried, clams on the half shell ($1.25),<br />\nlacked tast but were improved by a spicy horseradish<br />\nand tomato sauce.<br />\nThe pasta dish we ordered, Fettucine Alfredo, was<br />\nwell-prepared. It took its flavor from a rich parmesan<br />\ncheese and cream sauce which made the noodles rather<br />\nheavy and rapidly filling. A Chicken Cacciatore entree,<br />\npriced like other poultry and meat selections in the $7<br />\nrange, was an even greater challenge to finish. Over half<br />\na chicken was bathed in a tasty tomato sauce made thick<br />\nwith mushrooms. The meat itself was acceptable but<br />\nreally nothing special--the tast of the sauce didn't seep<br />\ninto the meat. The dish was accompanied by some<br />\nrather ordinary spaghetti, again saved by the fine sauce.<br />\nThe desserts were a disappointment. A small piece<br />\nof cheesecake also turned out to be rather bland. We<br />\ntried their tortoni ($1.00), a liquor-spiced Italian ice<br />\ncream, which offended our delicate sensibilities when it<br />\nwas served in a tiny paper cup. This was a give-away<br />\nthat the dessert was pre-packaged, and it tasted it, as the<br />\nliquer was hardly noticeable. But the expresso coffee,<br />\nseived in its own pot, was quite good.<br />\nThe service was friendly and quick, in fact if anything too quick. There was little time to relax between<br />\ncourses, but perhaps this was just another manifestation<br />\nof the American rather than European character of this<br />\nrestaurant.<br />\nSabatino's has a wide selection of Italian and<br />\nAmerican wines at moderate prices. A Ruffino Chianti,<br />\nfull-bodied and smooth, made a good accompaniment<br />\nfor our meal. Like most on the list, it was priced at<br />\n$3.50 for a half-bottle. We paid $26.00, tip included,<br />\nfor a plentiful dinner, but you could get by with a lot<br />\nless if you go to Sabatino's. You might not be persuaded that you're back in the Old Country, but your<br />\nstomach will at least go home happy.<br /><br />\n1..mmilmesr<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nThe Senior<br />\nClass Film Series<br />\nPresents<br /><br />\nPIT<br /><br />\nSTOP<br /><br />\n,'<br /><br />\nOIL<br /><br />\nCHANGE,\u00a9<br />\nWBE, OIL &amp; FILTER<br /><br />\nMEW<br /><br />\nMOST<br />\nAMERICAN<br /><br />\nFriday: 7, 9, &amp; 11 p.m.<br /><br />\nGo see thefireworks!<br /><br />\n10 MINUTE<br />\nOUR ONLY BUSINESS<br /><br />\nWITH A PERFORMANCE:<br />\nBY LINDA RONSTADT<br /><br />\nSaturday: 7, &amp; 11 p.m.<br />\nNO 9 p.m. show<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nHome of the<br /><br />\nAdmission: $1.00<br />\nShaffer 3<br /><br />\n$1095<br /><br />\nFEATURING<br />\nPENNZOIL<br />\n1 OW-40<br /><br />\nPLUS<br />\nFOREIGN<br />\nTAX<br />\nCARS<br />\nPLUS FREE UNDERHOOD RUM CHKX<br /><br />\n1025 WEST 41st ST. 235-6336<br />\nBETWEEN FALLS ROAD &amp; ROLAND AVENUE<br />\nV4 MILE WEST OF ROTUNDA MALL<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 13<br /><br />\n\"I've gotPabst Blue Ribbon on my mind.\"<br />\naiveritt\u00b001k161NA,LfiAtgeutAtionke<br />\n\"WES()WREST PROOLIC TS PROVI DIE ITS PRIZED RAW<br />\nONLY THE FINEST OF HOPS AND GRAINS ARE USED<br /><br />\njgctedadjinteukaeat in. 1893<br /><br />\n(Pabg<br />\nBlue Ribbon<br />\nEE<br />\n;<br />\n11<br /><br />\n,C 1979 PABST BREWING COMPANY, ?vi1waukee..V./141(s and t4ther<br /><br />\nPAGE 14 I APRIL 20, 1979<br /><br />\nWhite's Second Novel<br /><br />\nA Complete Achievement<br />\nNocturnes for the King of Naples, by<br />\nEdmund White. 148 pages.
