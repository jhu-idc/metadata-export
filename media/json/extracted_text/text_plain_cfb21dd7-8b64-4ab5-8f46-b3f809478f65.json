A great deal of<br />\ncorruption in government hasn't<br />\nbeen exposed in the other states,<br />\nthat's all. Chicago and Boston<br />\ncertainly can't be cast as lily<br />\nwhite politically.

First, recent cries<br />\nfrom the student body for more<br />\noff-campus housing have been<br />\nplacated. The Student Council<br />\nHousing Committee has done its<br />\njob. Second, there was an<br />\nincrease in the level of tension<br />\nbetween the Homewood<br />\nCommunity and the University.<br />\nThis reaction, however, is<br />\nconcurrent with the on-going<br />\ndevelopment of the \"Campus<br />\nPlan\" at the Metro Center, an<br />\nattempt to plan, justify and<br />\ndecide Hopkins' future<br />\nexpansion. Because Eduardo<br />\nBaranano, the man heading the<br />\n\"Campus Plan\" has been working<br />\nin close cooperation with Dick<br />\nCook, the director of the Greater<br />\nHomewood Community<br />\nCorporation (GHCC), and<br />\nbecause, in simple terms, the plan<br />\nallows the community tO See in<br />\nadvance what the University will<br />\ncome up with next, the \"Campus<br />\nPlan\" is a positive step. The third<br />\nconsequence of the purchase<br />\nconcerns people. The<br />\nBaltimorean, as it stands now,<br />\nwill die. The hull will remain, but<br />\nthe inner ship and the heritage<br />\nwill yield to the forces of<br />\nexpediency. People will have to<br />\nmove out. Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall, no doubt, correctly<br />\nnoted that most of the tenants<br />\nwere on short-term leases. But<br />\nthat doesn't mean anything.<br />\nLeases are renewed. Many of the<br />\npeople moving out of the<br />\nBaltimorean have lived there a<br />\nlong time.<br />\nIt is this type of consequence<br />\nthat often disturbs an<br />\n<br />\nva4s<br />\n<br />\norganization like the GHCC,<br />\nwhich is a federation of fourteen<br />\nneighborhood groups interested<br />\nin \"improving the quality of life<br />\nin North Central Baltimore.\"<br />\nThey provide programs, funded<br />\nby State and Federal funds, such<br />\nas an Employment Center, -a<br />\nSenior Citizens program, and a<br />\nMayor's Office.

Eduardo Baranano at<br />\nthe Metro Center has been<br />\nworking with Dick Cook to try<br />\nto regulate these problems, but<br />\nthe problems will always exist.<br />\nThe failure to consult the<br />\ncommittee on Institutional<br />\nEncroachment represented an<br />\narrogance and indifference that<br />\nLambert (the committee's\"<br />\nchairman) was responding to.

The<br />\nmembers were prone to such<br />\nantics as riding motorcycles<br />\nthrough the basement.)<br />\nBut Mrs. M., as a rule, doesn't<br />\nlike Hopkins boys. It's<br />\napparently common for<br />\ncommunity members to be<br />\n<br />\nWilliam McClain: a refreshing personality<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\nDr. William McClain has been<br />\nat Hopkins nearly a quarter of a<br />\ncentury, outlasting presidents,<br />\nliterary movements, protests, and<br />\ncutbacks. One might exnect that<br />\nhe has long settled into his.<br />\nposition and solidified into one<br />\nof those great craggy figures<br />\nwhich exist at every university;<br />\nan old, annoying rock that<br />\neveryone keeps bumping against.<br />\nInstead, he is a .refreshing<br />\nchange from the usual type, tor<br />\nhis words about learning<br />\ncertainly fit himself, \"always<br />\nexploring for new things.\"<br />\nBorn in 1917 (and somehow<br />\nolder-looking than he actually is),<br />\nhe spent World War II teaching<br />\nGerman to officers in Madison,<br />\nWisconsin, and later went to<br />\nFrankfurt to work in repatriation<br />\nof Americans in France and<br />\nGermany. Upon returning to the<br />\nU.S., he took an instructor's post<br />\nat Harvard. in the German<br />\ndepartment. After a few years,<br />\nthough, he realized he was locked<br />\nout of advancement in Boston,<br />\nand so accepted an offer to come<br />\nto Hopkins in 1953.<br />\nAt that time, most of the<br />\n<br />\nhumanities were concerned with<br />\nnothing more than philology.<br />\nThat emphasis, of course, has<br />\nchanged; for the German<br />\ndepartment, the political<br />\nsituation has helped move things<br />\nalong. \"With two Germanys,\"<br />\nMcClain explained, \"a foreign<br />\nGermanist becomes important:<br />\nhe can stand aside, and see both<br />\nviews of the literature\u2014a stance<br />\nwhich might escape an East or<br />\nWest German scholar.\" This<br />\nopportunity has not been wasted;<br />\nin fact, Johns Hopkins is<br />\nironically well-known on the<br />\ncontinent as a foremost<br />\nhumanities institution. One of<br />\nthe reasons is the publication of<br />\nModern Language Notes, \u2022 of<br />\nwhich McClain is co-editor.<br />\nAs for possibilities for the<br />\nhumanities in general, McClain is<br />\nmore optimistic than most.<br />\nDespite the abolition of the<br />\nGerman major at Goucher, and<br />\nthe cutback in his own<br />\ndepartment to five positions, he<br />\nsees things getting better for<br />\ngraduates. The German<br />\ndepartment now places all its<br />\nPh.D.'s and there are no plans to<br />\ncurtail the acceptance rate of the<br />\n<br />\nprogram in face of the tight job<br />\nmarket. He even points out the<br />\ngrowth of inter-departmental.<br />\ncooperation in the humanities at<br />\nHopkins as an exciting new<br />\ndirection. \"The inter-action of<br />\nthe younger colleagues in the<br />\nhumanities,\" he says, \"may<br />\ndevelop into something which<br />\nwill make Hopkins unique, and<br />\nonce again a model for<br />\nuniversities.\"<br />\nMcClain's own courses and<br />\nwork make him a model for<br />\nother professors. He opens most<br />\nof his literature classes to all<br />\nstudents by allowing reading in<br />\ntranslation. He does not adhere<br />\nto any rigid critical theory or<br />\nignore everything outside of the<br />\ntext itself; the approach is<br />\n\"suspense\" and \"don't<br />\nindoctrinate.\" Nearly sixty, he<br />\ndoesn't foresee himself becoming<br />\nconservative and cynical, but<br />\n\"perhaps having reached a higher<br />\nplateau, able to understand<br />\ndifferent kinds of ideas.\" And to<br />\ntry to get a taste of what<br />\nstudents are thinking like, he<br />\nreades the current popular<br />\nfiction\u2014I noticed he had a copy<br />\nof Gravity's Rainbow on his<br />\n<br />\ndesk.<br />\nWhen McClain discussed some<br />\nfuture goals for his remaining<br />\nyears here, foremost of which is<br />\nhis concern that certain \"forces<br />\nare undermining the humanities.\"<br />\nHis work, to be sure, will be<br />\ndirected toward the support of<br />\nhumanistic studies at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nannoyed at the antics of Hopkins<br />\nstudents. What stands out in their<br />\nminds is the rambunctious<br />\nbehaviour that they have<br />\nwitnessed. But Mrs. M. thinks the<br />\nboys are nicer now. \"They used<br />\nto have that long, messy hair,<br />\ny'know? and tho..: dungarees<br />\nthey never washed. But they<br />\nseem to be improving. They're<br />\nnot like that anymore.\" Ah, the<br />\nquietude of the seventies.\"When<br />\nmy husband was alive, he used to<br />\nwrite letters to Mr. Eisenhower,<br />\ncomplaining about some of the<br />\nboys' behaviour. I was just<br />\nlooking at the replies the other<br />\nday.\" Mrs. M. thinks they must<br />\nbe paying more careful attention<br />\nto whom they accept these days.<br />\nI asked her what she thought<br />\nof Hopkins' purchase of the<br />\nBaltimorean. \"Well, I don't care<br />\nmuch, just sci long as they're nice<br />\nboys.\" I wondered briefly if I<br />\nshould ask her about elderly<br />\npeople leaving the Baltimorean.<br />\nBut I probably would have just<br />\nconfused and upset her with<br />\nideas she hadn't thought of. Her<br />\nanswer seemed to indicate that<br />\nnone of her friends lived at the<br />\nBaltimorean. But she's an old<br />\nlady, and she's alone.<br />\nMrs. M. is deciding now<br />\nwhether to rent to some<br />\nHopkin's students next year. \"I<br />\ntold them they couldn't bring<br />\nwomen upstairs, or drink. After<br />\nall, it's for their own good.\"<br />\nShe's old, and the boys next<br />\ndoor have been nice to her. It<br />\nnever occurs to her that they<br />\n'fling women upstairs, or drink.<br />\nIt wouldn't be good for them.<br />\nAnd they're good boys so they<br />\nmust know that.<br />\n********<br />\n<br />\nEduardo Baranano works in an<br />\noffice at the Metro Center, in the<br />\nbasement of Shriver Hall.

On that<br />\nfreezing Wednesday night; the<br />\nwhole of Baltimore's Jewish<br />\ncommunity seemed to rain down<br />\non the Pikes Theatre in an<br />\nunannounced \u201eswoop. When the<br />\ndust had cleared, I was perched<br />\non a second row corner seat,<br />\nstraining to see through a<br />\nbobbing array of wigs\u201e toupees.,<br />\nand sundry obstacles. It was not<br />\nthe first time that my insight<br />\ndeficit had taken its toll, and I<br />\ndreaded the sore neck that would<br />\ntaunt me for venturing out like a<br />\nfool. Thankfully, any<br />\ninconvenience was redeemed by<br />\nthe movie, which is al stunning<br />\nportrayal of Jewish life in New<br />\nYork's Lower East Side at the<br />\nturn of the century.<br />\nThe spirit in the theatre was a<br />\nfitting complement to the movie.<br />\nIt could have been the opening .of<br />\nAnsky's \"The Dybbuk\" in Vilna<br />\nor a Maurice Schwartz<br />\nproduction in New York in the<br />\n'20's.

Now theysat looking at<br />\na painted mirror dotted with<br />\nHollywood actors who were<br />\nsupposed to:be them.<br />\n\"Hester Street\" is the story of<br />\na young Jewish man named Jake<br />\nwho leaves his wife Gittel and<br />\nson Yossel (later Joey) in the<br />\n\"old country\" to find fortune in<br />\nAmerica. Before very long his air<br />\nof piety is traded for a 3-piece<br />\nsuit and a bowler. A flirtatious<br />\nyoung woman named Mamie<br />\nFein becomes a formidable<br />\npursuit for Jake and he is so<br />\nengrossed with her that when<br />\nGittel and Joey come over to<br />\nAmerica, he shuts them in the<br />\napartment and marches on in<br />\nquest of the great Mamie, a \"real<br />\nYankee Lady.\" Conveniently<br />\nsituated in the family's<br />\napartment is a religious and<br />\nscholarly boarder named Mr.<br />\nBernstein who, in Jake's frequent<br />\nabsence, falls in love with equally<br />\nreligious Gittel. Both of them are<br />\nadamant in maintaining<br />\nobservance of all the traditions<br />\nthat were brought over from the<br />\nOld Country. If you're thinking<br />\n<br />\nthat a \"Bob+Carol+Ted+Alice\"type menage is just what's<br />\nneeded to round out this story,<br />\nyou're well trained in the ways of<br />\ncontemporary kitsch film, but<br />\nway off the track.

It<br />\nis annoyingly predictable at times<br />\nand much too simple. No<br />\nstimulating sub-plots grow at the<br />\nseams of the production to add a<br />\nbit of suspense or excitement. All<br />\nthat one can say in defense of the<br />\nplot is that perhaps in remaining<br />\ntrue to the times, the story was<br />\nsimple, just as life was far more<br />\n\"simple\" then.

As<br />\nmy colleague Emily Ahern points<br />\nout, it may be arguable whether<br />\none can ever make a completely<br />\nsatisfactory study of the impact<br />\nof sex-role stereotyping in a<br />\nsingle society or a homogeneous<br />\nsample. How could one ever<br />\nisolate the role of sex-typing<br />\nunder those conditions, when all<br />\nthat may be compared are the<br />\nboys' performances with the<br />\ngirls' performances?<br />\nThis difficulty, while by no<br />\nmeans surmounted, would at<br />\nleast be partly qualified if one<br />\ncould compare the test<br />\nperformances of children in<br />\ndifferent societies. Thus one<br />\nmight try to discover how boys<br />\nand girls in Taiwan\u2014for<br />\ninstance\u2014perform on<br />\nmathematical tests and on tests<br />\nof verbal precocity, much as is<br />\n<br />\nbeing done for North American<br />\nchildren. There are, of course,<br />\nobvious and serious<br />\nmethodoligical problems implicit<br />\nin designing tests that could<br />\nfacilitate cross-cultural<br />\ncomparisons. But if these<br />\nproblems could be solved, we<br />\nmight find that Taiwanese boys.<br />\nand girls do equally well on both<br />\nthe mathematical and the verbal<br />\ntests; that both do better than<br />\nAmerican girls (and, quite<br />\nprobably, than American boys as<br />\nwell) on the mathematical tests;<br />\nand that both do less well than<br />\nAmerican boys on verbal<br />\nprecocity tests. If we were to<br />\nconcede any reliability to all of<br />\nour imaginary tests, then these<br />\nresults would help to expose<br />\nspeculations about some basic<br />\ndifference between the sexes for<br />\nwhat they really are. I hasten to<br />\nconcede that my speculations are<br />\nor course equally speculative. But<br />\nthe little that we do know about<br />\nthe difference among cultures in<br />\nother regards certainly inclines<br />\nme to believe that none of us is<br />\nyet in a position even to<br />\nspeculate about basic sex<br />\ndifferences of a kind that might<br />\nshow up on mathematical and<br />\nverbal tests.<br />\nTo ask whether we are<br />\nconfronting some inherent,<br />\nintrisic, or genetic difference<br />\nwithout acknowleding at the<br />\noutset that sex-typing can attach<br />\nitself to any aspect of learned<br />\nbehavior, depending upon the<br />\noft-unstated (even unconsious)<br />\npremises of each culture, seems<br />\nat the very least gratuitous.<br />\nChildren do have a curious way<br />\nof being obedient; in North<br />\nAmerican: society, they<br />\ncommonly follow parental<br />\ndirectives by ninning away from<br />\nhome, for instance, or by being<br />\nunable to decide upon a fulfilling<br />\ncareer\u2014and I mean this in deadly<br />\nearnest. Girls can be more<br />\nobedient than boys (in societies<br />\nwhere girls are expected to be<br />\nmore obedient), to the point<br />\nwhere they may even obey an<br />\nunstated requirement that<br />\nincludes doing badly at math.<br />\nSurely we can imagine a society<br />\nin which girlhood, femininity,<br />\npopularity, normality, the love of<br />\none's male parent and male<br />\nsiblings, the psychic security of<br />\none's future boy friend, and<br />\nHeaven knows what else are not<br />\ninvisibly linked , to performing<br />\npoorly on math tests. It ought<br />\nnot to be hard, then, to continue<br />\nto study whether expressed<br />\ndifferences in performances of<br />\nthis sort saysomething about the<br />\nsocial context of learning,<br />\nwithout falling back on<br />\nspeculations about the genetics<br />\nof \"groups\"\u2014in this case, groups<br />\nof boys and girls.<br />\nIndividuals with red hair may<br />\nbe presumed to inherit that trait,<br />\nas men and women inherit their<br />\nsexual anatomy. If mathematical<br />\nand verbal tests of redhaired<br />\nchildren revealed that, as a<br />\ncategory, they did better or<br />\nworse at math or With words<br />\nthan any other comparable<br />\nca tegory\u2014Blackhaired children,<br />\nor lefthanded children, say\u2014I<br />\nthink it most unlikely that<br />\nanyone would be rash enough<br />\n<br />\nimmediately to speculate that we<br />\nwere dealing with some \"basic<br />\ndifference.\"<br />\nTo take perceived differences<br />\nfor granted in order to collect<br />\ndata is methodologically<br />\ndefensible, as long as we<br />\nremember that it is not only the<br />\ndifferences themselves, but how<br />\nwe human beings conjure with<br />\nthem in our beliefs and behavior,<br />\nthat matters. The persisting<br />\nquestion may appear to be that<br />\nof separating out the effects of<br />\n\"real\" or \"intrinsic\" differences<br />\n\"...all differences must be<br />\nperceived; the perceptions<br />\nthemselves are socially<br />\nlearned; the way the<br />\ndistinction between<br />\nso-called basic and other<br />\ndifferences is conceived is<br />\nitself an artifact of learned<br />\nsocial perception.\"<br />\nfrom other (socially learned)<br />\ndifferences. But we cannot afford<br />\nto forget that all differences must<br />\nbe perceived; that the<br />\nperceptions themselves are<br />\nsocially learned; and that the way<br />\nthe distinction between so-called<br />\nbasic and other differences is<br />\nconceived is itself an artifact of<br />\nlearned social perception. It is for<br />\nthis reason that we cannot<br />\nreadily accept--nor should<br />\nwe--the idea that, if redheaded<br />\nchildren performed differently<br />\non tests from blackhaired<br />\nchildren, the difference might be<br />\nrooted in \"some basic<br />\ndifference.\" But; then, why does<br />\nthe idea come so readily to mind,<br />\nwhen dealing with males and<br />\nfemales, blacks and whites, and<br />\nother counterposed groups?<br />\nSurely there is some reason to<br />\nsuppose that the persuasiveness<br />\nof a \"basic difference\" notion is<br />\npositively correlated with the<br />\nlevel of challenge a \"group\"<br />\nappears to be making to an<br />\nexisting distribution of privilege.<br />\nI suppose that I--and, I trust,<br />\nmany anthropologists like.<br />\nme--might feel more comfortable<br />\nwith speculations about intrinsic<br />\ndifferences if they did not rise to<br />\nthe surface in such a curious way,<br />\nand particularly in areas where<br />\nour reliable sociological<br />\nknowledge remains quite<br />\nimperfect.<br />\nNeedless to add, none of these<br />\nremarks is meant to reflect<br />\ncritically on the research of Drs.<br />\nStanley, Fox and Hogan, which is<br />\nclearly revealing a great deal<br />\nabout the nature of intelligence,<br />\nthe pedagogical process, and the<br />\nsocial implications of precocity.<br />\nIt is meant instead to raise a<br />\ngeneral question as to why<br />\npopular thinking about the<br />\nindividual and the group, the<br />\nnature of groups, and the nature<br />\nof culture continues to remain<br />\nquite unchanged, in spite of half<br />\na century of honest attempts to<br />\ndocument its limitations and<br />\npoint out its dangers.<br />\nDr. Sidney<br />\nW.

It is a completed<br />\ntransaction, an executed<br />\ncontract, in the words of Dick<br />\nCook: \"A lack of an issue.\"<br />\nWhen I walked into the lobby of<br />\nthe Baltimorean in the afternoon,<br />\nand began asking questions as to<br />\nthe nature and timing of the<br />\ntransition, the manager walked<br />\nup to me and began to give me a<br />\nvery stiff, curt series of replies.<br />\n\"If you have any questions, the<br />\nman you want is Mr. Heist, in the<br />\nUniversity Housing Office of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.\" It was no<br />\nrunaround. There was simply<br />\nnothing to say. The Baltimorean,<br />\nsir, has been sold.<br />\nif I have learned one thing<br />\nabout Baltimore, it is that the<br />\nreal essence of anything in this<br />\ntown is not to be found within<br />\nmundane experience, but within<br />\nthe odd places, at odd hours.<br />\n<br />\nThis observation led me to the<br />\ninescapable conclusion that the<br />\nonly way I was going to get any<br />\nhuman feedback on the sale of<br />\nthe Baltimorean was to walk into<br />\nthe lobby and talk to someone,<br />\nbut after midnight. \u2022<br />\nShe was a middle-age woman,<br />\nwith black hair, wearing the same<br />\nglasses you see on everyone who<br />\nnever heard of fashion. She<br />\nstared at me for nearly a minute<br />\nbefore letting me in with the buzzer. I wondered again if it had<br />\nmade much sense to tackle this<br />\nassignment wearing my leather<br />\njacket. \"I'm a student from<br />\nHopkins,\" I said. But would that<br />\nintroduction put her at ease?<br />\nShe sat in an enclosed section<br />\nof the lobby, by the switchboard.<br />\nAs I walked towards her, she<br />\nturned to her right as if to talk to<br />\nsomeone. \"Someone\" was a late<br />\nnight television movie she<br />\nobviously wasn't really watching<br />\n<br />\nanyway, but to whom she had to<br />\nnod _acknowledgment to before<br />\nshe fully directed her attention<br />\nto me. I asked her if any Hopkins<br />\nstudents had moved in yet.<br />\n\"No,\" she replied, in a very<br />\nclear, high-pitched tone that had<br />\nno levity. \"They don't start any<br />\nmoving in till April 1st, I think.(Hopkins students start moving<br />\nin in September) People had<br />\nalready begun to move out, she<br />\nsaid. Some of them had lived in<br />\nthe hotel a long time--one woman<br />\nforty years. \"It's a damn<br />\nshame,\"she said,\"But I guess the<br />\nstudents have to have a place to<br />\nlive, though I can't understand<br />\nwhy the school can't build the<br />\nbuildings. They have the<br />\nmoney.\" But she was quick to<br />\npoint out that,\"most of the folks<br />\ndon't have no problem moving.<br />\nThey all got money, and money<br />\ntalks, y'know.\" One couple<br />\nthough: The wife had chronic<br />\n<br />\narthritis, and the husband had<br />\nbeen hospitalized several times,<br />\nwith hearftrouble. It isn't always<br />\neasy.<br />\nShe and the. rest of the staff<br />\nwould be leaving soon.<br />\nThe lobby at the Baltimorean<br />\nis pleasant, quiet and a pervasive<br />\nblue that should not be<br />\ndestroyed. It will be though. The<br />\nwhole lobby will be changed.<br />\n\"Just like the Belvedere. You<br />\nknow it, on Charles and Chase? It<br />\nused to be the finest hotel in<br />\nBaltimore. But when the Hopkins<br />\nstudents'moved in, they wrecked<br />\nthat place. They took down the<br />\nchandelier.

The Middies led at half-time<br />\nby fourteen points but a<br />\npersistent Hopkins offense<br />\n<br />\nnarrowed the margin to nine with<br />\ntwo minutes to go. Forced to<br />\nfoul in order to regain possession<br />\nof the ball, the Hopkins<br />\nhoopsters were hurt when the<br />\nfree throws were converted by<br />\nNavy. The victory margin was<br />\nseventeen points but, in reality, it<br />\nwas a much closer game.<br />\nCommenting on Hopkins'<br />\ngames against Division I schools,<br />\nCoach Rupert said, \"It is a<br />\n<br />\nSwimmers outscored by LaSalle<br />\nBy BRUCE FOX<br />\nDespite excellent individual<br />\nperformances, the Hopkins' swim<br />\nteam was outscored Wednesday<br />\nnight by its formidable<br />\nOpponents at LaSalle 69-44. The<br />\nJays and the Explorers continued<br />\ntheir outstanding rivalry which<br />\nbegan two years ago with a 58-55<br />\nvictory going to Hopkins,<br />\nfollowed last year with a win for<br />\nLaSalle by the identical score.<br />\nThe meet began with LaSalle<br />\nrunning away with the 400-yard<br />\nmedley relay while, in the<br />\nprocess, Hopkins' Dean<br />\nBuchenauer swam his best career<br />\n100-yard breaststroke leg in<br />\n1:02.4. This was followed by a<br />\none-two showing in the<br />\n1000-yard freestyle for freshmen<br />\nTodd Russell and Frank<br />\nMcGovern, two ot the many<br />\nexcellent rookies on the Jays'<br />\nsquad. Their times of 10:34.6<br />\nand 10:36.4 were both individual<br />\nhighs.<br />\nCaptain Jim Spiering went on<br />\nto place third in the 200-yard<br />\nfreestyle with an excellent time<br />\nof 1:48.9 which qualifies him for<br />\nthe Division III national<br />\nchampionships to be held in<br />\nMarch.<br />\nThe 200-yard individual<br />\nmedley followed and turned out<br />\nto be one of the most exciting<br />\nevents of the evening. The event<br />\nwas won by freshman Mike Bay<br />\nat 2:02.5 but it was senior Bob<br />\nStoever who made it a thriller.<br />\nWith 50 yards remaining, Stoever<br />\nwas in fourth place, 1-1/2 body<br />\nlengths behind two LaSalle<br />\nswimmers. \"Smokey\", however,<br />\nturned it on and touched before<br />\nhis two rivals knew what<br />\nhappened, to take second with a<br />\n<br />\ntime of 2:04.96!<br />\nFreshman Mike DiCio<br />\ndisplayed his steady<br />\nimprovement in the diving<br />\ncompetition as he finished first in<br />\nthe one-meter and second in the<br />\nthree-meter event. This was<br />\nfollowed by an easier victory for<br />\nStoever in the 200-yard butterfly<br />\nas he won by two seconds. An<br />\nexcellent time was also turned in<br />\nby Frank McGovern in this event<br />\nconsidering that he had<br />\ncompeted in the grueling<br />\n1000-yard freestyle earlier.<br />\nMike Bay continued his string<br />\nof excellent performances by<br />\nrunning away with the 200- yard<br />\nbackstroke. His time of 1:57.59<br />\nbroke his own university record<br />\nset in December which had been<br />\nposted as the top time for this<br />\nevent in both Divisions II and III<br />\nthis year. Jim Spiering then<br />\ntallied a career best time of 49.2<br />\nin the 100-yard freestyle, placing<br />\nthird.<br />\nTodd Russell took second in<br />\nthe 500-yard freestyle as Eric<br />\nHorning registered his best time<br />\nof 5:11 finishing fourth. Dean<br />\nBuchenauer went on to take<br />\nthird in the 200-yard<br />\nbreaststroke with a time of<br />\n2:19.4, which just missed<br />\nqualifying him for the national<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nIn all, thirteen career best<br />\ntimes were turned in but<br />\nnonetheless LaSalle proved too<br />\noverpowering this year.<br />\nSpecial credit goes to Frank<br />\nMcGovern who, in swimming the<br />\n\"big triple\", (200-yard butterfly<br />\nand the 1000 and 500-yard<br />\nfreestyles), set two personal<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThis gives the Blue Jays a 4-4<br />\n<br />\nrecord with a tough meet coming<br />\nup tomorrow against a strong<br />\nAmerican University team whom<br />\nHopkins beat here last year.<br />\nThe women's swim team put<br />\nan unofficial lock on the<br />\nwomen's MAC swim title<br />\nyesterday when they defeated<br />\nthe defending champs from<br />\nUrsinus College in the Bears<br />\nhome pool, 55-40.

He sank them both and<br />\nUrsinus took the ensuing<br />\ninbounds pass downcourt for a<br />\nbucket with a Blue Jay foul on<br />\nthe play. At this time the refs<br />\nwere approached by Coach<br />\nWarren Fry of Ursinus who<br />\nclaimd that Dean Uhler was the<br />\nvictim of the prior Stubits foul<br />\nand should have shot, not Paytas.<br />\nThe referees ruled that the game<br />\nwould be stopped and Uhler<br />\nwould \"re-shoot\" the foul.<br />\nFortunately, Dean hit both and<br />\nno further adjustments were<br />\nmade by the officials.<br />\nDespite being physically tired<br />\nfrom the grueling game at Navy,<br />\ngood performances were turned<br />\nin by Andy Scheinfeld who had<br />\n18 points and 11 rebounds; Dean<br />\nUhler with 17 points, 10<br />\nrebounds and four blocked shots;<br />\nand John Finston who chipped in<br />\nwith 12 points and 9 caroms.<br />\nAfter a week's respite the<br />\nvarsity cagers next battle<br />\nSwarthmore next Thursday at<br />\nthe Athletic Center.

This year's<br />\nseason began on Jan. 26 and will<br />\ncontinue through the end of<br />\nMarch.

If<br />\nyou're Aristotle Onassis, you<br />\ndon't need government. Most<br />\npeople do, however.<br />\nOne must always keep in mind<br />\nthat the public service is never<br />\nperfect. Our founding fathers<br />\nspoke of founding a more perfect<br />\nunion as opposed to the perfect<br />\nunion. The Federalist Papers<br />\npoint to the need for a<br />\ncontinuing experiment.<br />\nToday, the biggest dearth in<br />\ngovernment is a lack of<br />\nleadership. Today a tremendous<br />\nsegment of the country is very<br />\nfar ahead of the leadership, what<br />\nwithin<br /><br />\nPI<br /><br />\n0<br />\n7n-<br /><br />\nzpter,eituse Wilastg4. /375<br /><br />\nlittle of it exists.

What<br />\nare your opinions on this alleged<br />\ncorruption?<br />\nMoney<br />\nMaryland politics are no more<br />\ncorrupt than other politics in the<br />\ncountry. A great deal of<br />\ncorruption in government hasn't<br />\nbeen exposed in the other states,<br />\nthat's all. Chicago and Boston<br />\ncertainly can't be cast as lily<br />\nwhite politically. And Maryland<br />\nantics are a piker compared to<br />\nRichard Nixon. Governor Hall is<br />\napparently on his way to jail in<br />\nOklahoma. So, certainly<br />\nMaryland hasn't cornered any<br />\nmarket regarding corruption.<br />\nWe must remember that the<br />\nAmerican government system has<br />\nnever distinguished itself for its<br />\noverall integrity. What we don't<br />\nseem to ever consider, also, is the<br />\ncorruption in the private sector<br />\nof this country. We see then, the<br />\ncorruption pervades the entire<br />\nA merican system, and is not<br />\nconfined to government.<br />\nIf government isn't going right,<br />\nif people don't like it, then they<br />\nhave only to look in the mirror<br />\nevery morning. If you want to<br />\nchange government you are going<br />\nto have to get off your ass.<br />\nAnd you don't have to have a<br />\nlot of money to run for office.<br />\nYou just have to care. My father<br />\nwas a professor of the bible,<br />\ntaught the old testament. He<br />\ndidn't have a million dollars.<br />\nI care about government, and<br />\nso I ran. I first ran for delegate to<br />\nthe state convention. I lost. I<br />\nwasn't even elected to one of<br />\neight positions open.<br />\n1When I ran for the house of<br />\ndelegates it was a hot summer,<br />\nyou know, the kind that only<br />\nBaltimore knows. It was a hot<br />\nAugust day and not even a<br />\nmaddog Englishman would go<br />\nout in that noon day sun. After<br />\ndistributing a bundle of<br />\npamphlets, I was sweating and<br />\npanting so much that I sat down<br />\nand cried. I later walked into an<br />\nair conditioned White Tavern to<br /><br />\ncool off and caught pneumonia.<br />\nAll those people who gripe<br />\ndon't do anything. The<br />\ngovernment isn't working today<br />\nbecause they're not working.<br />\nToday we don't have the active<br />\ncitizenry that a democracy<br />\nrequires.<br />\nWhat do you feel was the value<br />\nof a Hopkins education? Also,<br />\nwhat is your present affiliation<br />\nwith the University?<br />\nMy undergraduate education<br />\nmade me literate and made me<br />\nconversive to ideas around me. It<br />\ngave me an ability to relate my<br />\nday-to-day experiences to<br />\nhistory. My education enabled<br />\nme to search out information.<br />\nToday I ant a graduac student<br />\nat the Hopkins Metro Center.<br />\nThat has helped me<br />\nimmeasurably. It has '..posed me<br />\nto a variety of issues and<br />\nproblems, and allowed me to<br />\nintelligently judge potential<br />\npublic policy.<br />\n'Advice<br />\nDo you have any advice for<br />\nthose at Hopkins thinking of<br />\npursuing a career in government<br />\nor politics?<br />\nId advise them that they are<br />\ngoing to give up a tremendous<br />\namount of privacy and time,<br />\nmake a tremendous sacrifice in<br />\ngeneral. Also, your wife better be<br />\nsomeone who is sympathetic and<br />\nunderstanding to. that reality.<br />\nYou should read avariciously-all you can get your hands on.<br />\nPolitics is like a disease. Before<br />\nyou catch it, I guess it is<br />\nadvisable to know what<br />\nsymptoms you will suffer.<br />\nAlso, people who go into<br />\npolitics should have an<br />\nalternative way of making a<br />\nliving. The tradgedy in this<br />\nbusiness- is to stick around so<br />\nlong that you have no option. I<br />\ncan always turn back to<br />\npracticing law. You need an<br />\noption.<br />\nI worry a lot about that<br />\nin-and-out proposition. I know<br />\nthere is a time when your options<br />\ndie. Then you're trapped.<br />\nPeople considering being a<br />\npolitician should feel proud of<br />\nthis profession. There is nothing<br />\ndishonorable about being \u2022a<br />\npolitician.

Larouche. Larouche,<br />\nhowever, did not attend, due to<br />\nhis \"urgent mission\" in Italy.<br /><br />\nInstead, the speaker was Niko.<br />\nSyvriotis, who looked like a<br />\ncharacter out of a gangster<br />\nmovie, wearing dark glasses and<br />\nspeaking with a thick<br />\nMediterranean accent.<br />\nHis speech, which rambled on<br />\nfor over 21<br />\n/<br />\n2 hours, was billed as<br />\nthe Labor Party's \"State of the<br />\nWorld\" address. He repeatedly<br />\nspoke of \"austerity\", Averill<br />\nHarriman, \"New York bankers,\"<br />\nand an Italian named Agnelli as<br />\nthe chief evils of the world.<br />\nOutside the Hilton, about 30<br />\nmen and women picketed the<br />\nrally. Denouncing the Labor<br />\nParty as \"neo-fascists\", they were<br />\nmembers of left-wing groups such<br />\nas the October League and the<br />\nNew American Movement.

There, they<br />\nattempted to recruit new<br />\nmembers.

Mesaros explained<br />\nthat \"our job terms expired\", all<br />\nat the same time, apparently.<br />\nOne source, however, noted that<br />\nthe library management felt that<br />\nLabor Party members engaged in<br />\n\"too .niuch politics during<br />\nworking hours.\"<br />\nThe platform of the Labor<br />\nParty, although vague, is<br />\neconomically oriented. It calls<br />\nfor a Marxist economy. Members<br />\ncall each other comrades. It is<br />\noften associated with the Soviet<br />\nUnion, even though Syvriotis<br />\nattacked that nation as much as<br />\nany country in his address. It<br />\nurges the establishment of an<br />\nInternational Development bank<br />\nto help third world nation.<br />\nMainly, the Labor Party is<br /><br />\ncontent to sit back analyze, and<br />\ncriticize anyone in power.<br />\nSome members, though, do try<br />\nto attain office on the Labor<br />\nParty ticket. In Baltimore, the<br />\nLabor Party has two candidates<br />\nfor Congress. Robert Primack is<br />\nrunning against Barbara Mikulski<br />\nin the 3rd District, and William<br />\nSalisbury is bucking Parron<br />\nMitchell in the 7th District.<br />\nEither contestant might just as<br />\neasily try to make water flow<br />\nuphill, as far as winning is<br />\nconcerned.<br />\nThe official Labor Party<br />\nprediction calls for just that, if<br />\nanyone cares to pay attention.<br />\n\"Financial capitalism, invented<br />\nin 1871, will not last beyond<br />\nMarch, 1976.

The hull will remain, but<br />\nthe inner ship and the heritage<br />\nwill yield to the forces of<br />\nexpediency. People will have to<br />\nmove out. Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall, no doubt, correctly<br />\nnoted that most of the tenants<br />\nwere on short-term leases. But<br />\nthat doesn't mean anything.<br />\nLeases are renewed. Many of the<br />\npeople moving out of the<br />\nBaltimorean have lived there a<br />\nlong time.<br />\nIt is this type of consequence<br />\nthat often disturbs an<br /><br />\nva4s<br /><br />\norganization like the GHCC,<br />\nwhich is a federation of fourteen<br />\nneighborhood groups interested<br />\nin \"improving the quality of life<br />\nin North Central Baltimore.\"<br />\nThey provide programs, funded<br />\nby State and Federal funds, such<br />\nas an Employment Center, -a<br />\nSenior Citizens program, and a<br />\nMayor's Office.

Eduardo Baranano at<br />\nthe Metro Center has been<br />\nworking with Dick Cook to try<br />\nto regulate these problems, but<br />\nthe problems will always exist.<br />\nThe failure to consult the<br />\ncommittee on Institutional<br />\nEncroachment represented an<br />\narrogance and indifference that<br />\nLambert (the committee's\"<br />\nchairman) was responding to. It<br />\nwas also a mistake, for if the time<br />\ncomes when a proposed method<br />\nof expansion is only quasi-legal<br />\n(i.e., the zoning isn't right.), such<br />\nBaltimorean employee<br />\nprevious diplomatic slips will<br />\nhardly make Lambert, et. al.<br />\n\"Institutional Encroachment.\"<br />\namenable.<br />\nWhen Hopkins bought the<br />\nLack of communication is the<br />\nBaltimorean, it failed to consult<br />\nbasic problem here, and that is<br />\nthat committee in .advance, as<br />\nwhy the Campus Plan may signal<br />\nhad been previously agreed.

She is the widow of<br />\na lawyer, and has occasionally<br />\nrented one of her upstairs<br />\napartments to Hopkins students.<br />\nShe has a large face, pulled-back<br />\nwhite hair, and that certain glow<br />\nthat some older people have, that<br />\nseems to say, \"All in all I've had<br />\na good life.\"<br />\nShe was wary of me at the<br />\ndoor. She said it was because she<br />\nwas eating dinner, but it was<br />\nobvious \u2014that she feared any<br />\nstranger, and I doubt that fear<br />\nwould have subsided if I hadn't<br />\nidentified myself as a member of<br />\nthe Sigma Nu fraternity next<br />\ndoor. The frat and Mrs. M. have<br />\nalways gotten along very well.<br />\nShe sends us her old magazines,<br />\nand we send her flowers every<br />\nChristmas. She thinks we're \"nice<br />\nboys.\" (The last tenants of the<br />\nfiat house was a now-defunct<br />\nchapter of Alpha Delta Phi. The<br />\nmembers were prone to such<br />\nantics as riding motorcycles<br />\nthrough the basement.)<br />\nBut Mrs. M., as a rule, doesn't<br />\nlike Hopkins boys. It's<br />\napparently common for<br />\ncommunity members to be<br /><br />\nWilliam McClain: a refreshing personality<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\nDr. William McClain has been<br />\nat Hopkins nearly a quarter of a<br />\ncentury, outlasting presidents,<br />\nliterary movements, protests, and<br />\ncutbacks. One might exnect that<br />\nhe has long settled into his.<br />\nposition and solidified into one<br />\nof those great craggy figures<br />\nwhich exist at every university;<br />\nan old, annoying rock that<br />\neveryone keeps bumping against.<br />\nInstead, he is a .refreshing<br />\nchange from the usual type, tor<br />\nhis words about learning<br />\ncertainly fit himself, \"always<br />\nexploring for new things.\"<br />\nBorn in 1917 (and somehow<br />\nolder-looking than he actually is),<br />\nhe spent World War II teaching<br />\nGerman to officers in Madison,<br />\nWisconsin, and later went to<br />\nFrankfurt to work in repatriation<br />\nof Americans in France and<br />\nGermany. Upon returning to the<br />\nU.S., he took an instructor's post<br />\nat Harvard. in the German<br />\ndepartment. After a few years,<br />\nthough, he realized he was locked<br />\nout of advancement in Boston,<br />\nand so accepted an offer to come<br />\nto Hopkins in 1953.<br />\nAt that time, most of the<br /><br />\nhumanities were concerned with<br />\nnothing more than philology.<br />\nThat emphasis, of course, has<br />\nchanged; for the German<br />\ndepartment, the political<br />\nsituation has helped move things<br />\nalong. \"With two Germanys,\"<br />\nMcClain explained, \"a foreign<br />\nGermanist becomes important:<br />\nhe can stand aside, and see both<br />\nviews of the literature\u2014a stance<br />\nwhich might escape an East or<br />\nWest German scholar.\" This<br />\nopportunity has not been wasted;<br />\nin fact, Johns Hopkins is<br />\nironically well-known on the<br />\ncontinent as a foremost<br />\nhumanities institution. One of<br />\nthe reasons is the publication of<br />\nModern Language Notes, \u2022 of<br />\nwhich McClain is co-editor.<br />\nAs for possibilities for the<br />\nhumanities in general, McClain is<br />\nmore optimistic than most.<br />\nDespite the abolition of the<br />\nGerman major at Goucher, and<br />\nthe cutback in his own<br />\ndepartment to five positions, he<br />\nsees things getting better for<br />\ngraduates. The German<br />\ndepartment now places all its<br />\nPh.D.'s and there are no plans to<br />\ncurtail the acceptance rate of the<br /><br />\nprogram in face of the tight job<br />\nmarket. He even points out the<br />\ngrowth of inter-departmental.<br />\ncooperation in the humanities at<br />\nHopkins as an exciting new<br />\ndirection. \"The inter-action of<br />\nthe younger colleagues in the<br />\nhumanities,\" he says, \"may<br />\ndevelop into something which<br />\nwill make Hopkins unique, and<br />\nonce again a model for<br />\nuniversities.\"<br />\nMcClain's own courses and<br />\nwork make him a model for<br />\nother professors. He opens most<br />\nof his literature classes to all<br />\nstudents by allowing reading in<br />\ntranslation. He does not adhere<br />\nto any rigid critical theory or<br />\nignore everything outside of the<br />\ntext itself; the approach is<br />\n\"suspense\" and \"don't<br />\nindoctrinate.\" Nearly sixty, he<br />\ndoesn't foresee himself becoming<br />\nconservative and cynical, but<br />\n\"perhaps having reached a higher<br />\nplateau, able to understand<br />\ndifferent kinds of ideas.\" And to<br />\ntry to get a taste of what<br />\nstudents are thinking like, he<br />\nreades the current popular<br />\nfiction\u2014I noticed he had a copy<br />\nof Gravity's Rainbow on his<br /><br />\ndesk.<br />\nWhen McClain discussed some<br />\nfuture goals for his remaining<br />\nyears here, foremost of which is<br />\nhis concern that certain \"forces<br />\nare undermining the humanities.\"<br />\nHis work, to be sure, will be<br />\ndirected toward the support of<br />\nhumanistic studies at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nannoyed at the antics of Hopkins<br />\nstudents. What stands out in their<br />\nminds is the rambunctious<br />\nbehaviour that they have<br />\nwitnessed. But Mrs. M. thinks the<br />\nboys are nicer now. \"They used<br />\nto have that long, messy hair,<br />\ny'know? and tho..: dungarees<br />\nthey never washed. But they<br />\nseem to be improving. They're<br />\nnot like that anymore.\" Ah, the<br />\nquietude of the seventies.\"When<br />\nmy husband was alive, he used to<br />\nwrite letters to Mr. Eisenhower,<br />\ncomplaining about some of the<br />\nboys' behaviour. I was just<br />\nlooking at the replies the other<br />\nday.\" Mrs. M. thinks they must<br />\nbe paying more careful attention<br />\nto whom they accept these days.<br />\nI asked her what she thought<br />\nof Hopkins' purchase of the<br />\nBaltimorean. \"Well, I don't care<br />\nmuch, just sci long as they're nice<br />\nboys.\" I wondered briefly if I<br />\nshould ask her about elderly<br />\npeople leaving the Baltimorean.<br />\nBut I probably would have just<br />\nconfused and upset her with<br />\nideas she hadn't thought of. Her<br />\nanswer seemed to indicate that<br />\nnone of her friends lived at the<br />\nBaltimorean. But she's an old<br />\nlady, and she's alone.<br />\nMrs. M. is deciding now<br />\nwhether to rent to some<br />\nHopkin's students next year. \"I<br />\ntold them they couldn't bring<br />\nwomen upstairs, or drink. After<br />\nall, it's for their own good.\"<br />\nShe's old, and the boys next<br />\ndoor have been nice to her. It<br />\nnever occurs to her that they<br />\n'fling women upstairs, or drink.<br />\nIt wouldn't be good for them.<br />\nAnd they're good boys so they<br />\nmust know that.<br />\n********<br /><br />\nEduardo Baranano works in an<br />\noffice at the Metro Center, in the<br />\nbasement of Shriver Hall.

When the<br />\ndust had cleared, I was perched<br />\non a second row corner seat,<br />\nstraining to see through a<br />\nbobbing array of wigs\u201e toupees.,<br />\nand sundry obstacles. It was not<br />\nthe first time that my insight<br />\ndeficit had taken its toll, and I<br />\ndreaded the sore neck that would<br />\ntaunt me for venturing out like a<br />\nfool.

All<br />\nthat one can say in defense of the<br />\nplot is that perhaps in remaining<br />\ntrue to the times, the story was<br />\nsimple, just as life was far more<br />\n\"simple\" then.

As<br />\nmy colleague Emily Ahern points<br />\nout, it may be arguable whether<br />\none can ever make a completely<br />\nsatisfactory study of the impact<br />\nof sex-role stereotyping in a<br />\nsingle society or a homogeneous<br />\nsample. How could one ever<br />\nisolate the role of sex-typing<br />\nunder those conditions, when all<br />\nthat may be compared are the<br />\nboys' performances with the<br />\ngirls' performances?<br />\nThis difficulty, while by no<br />\nmeans surmounted, would at<br />\nleast be partly qualified if one<br />\ncould compare the test<br />\nperformances of children in<br />\ndifferent societies. Thus one<br />\nmight try to discover how boys<br />\nand girls in Taiwan\u2014for<br />\ninstance\u2014perform on<br />\nmathematical tests and on tests<br />\nof verbal precocity, much as is<br /><br />\nbeing done for North American<br />\nchildren. There are, of course,<br />\nobvious and serious<br />\nmethodoligical problems implicit<br />\nin designing tests that could<br />\nfacilitate cross-cultural<br />\ncomparisons. But if these<br />\nproblems could be solved, we<br />\nmight find that Taiwanese boys.<br />\nand girls do equally well on both<br />\nthe mathematical and the verbal<br />\ntests; that both do better than<br />\nAmerican girls (and, quite<br />\nprobably, than American boys as<br />\nwell) on the mathematical tests;<br />\nand that both do less well than<br />\nAmerican boys on verbal<br />\nprecocity tests. If we were to<br />\nconcede any reliability to all of<br />\nour imaginary tests, then these<br />\nresults would help to expose<br />\nspeculations about some basic<br />\ndifference between the sexes for<br />\nwhat they really are. I hasten to<br />\nconcede that my speculations are<br />\nor course equally speculative. But<br />\nthe little that we do know about<br />\nthe difference among cultures in<br />\nother regards certainly inclines<br />\nme to believe that none of us is<br />\nyet in a position even to<br />\nspeculate about basic sex<br />\ndifferences of a kind that might<br />\nshow up on mathematical and<br />\nverbal tests.<br />\nTo ask whether we are<br />\nconfronting some inherent,<br />\nintrisic, or genetic difference<br />\nwithout acknowleding at the<br />\noutset that sex-typing can attach<br />\nitself to any aspect of learned<br />\nbehavior, depending upon the<br />\noft-unstated (even unconsious)<br />\npremises of each culture, seems<br />\nat the very least gratuitous.<br />\nChildren do have a curious way<br />\nof being obedient; in North<br />\nAmerican: society, they<br />\ncommonly follow parental<br />\ndirectives by ninning away from<br />\nhome, for instance, or by being<br />\nunable to decide upon a fulfilling<br />\ncareer\u2014and I mean this in deadly<br />\nearnest. Girls can be more<br />\nobedient than boys (in societies<br />\nwhere girls are expected to be<br />\nmore obedient), to the point<br />\nwhere they may even obey an<br />\nunstated requirement that<br />\nincludes doing badly at math.<br />\nSurely we can imagine a society<br />\nin which girlhood, femininity,<br />\npopularity, normality, the love of<br />\none's male parent and male<br />\nsiblings, the psychic security of<br />\none's future boy friend, and<br />\nHeaven knows what else are not<br />\ninvisibly linked , to performing<br />\npoorly on math tests. It ought<br />\nnot to be hard, then, to continue<br />\nto study whether expressed<br />\ndifferences in performances of<br />\nthis sort saysomething about the<br />\nsocial context of learning,<br />\nwithout falling back on<br />\nspeculations about the genetics<br />\nof \"groups\"\u2014in this case, groups<br />\nof boys and girls.<br />\nIndividuals with red hair may<br />\nbe presumed to inherit that trait,<br />\nas men and women inherit their<br />\nsexual anatomy.

The persisting<br />\nquestion may appear to be that<br />\nof separating out the effects of<br />\n\"real\" or \"intrinsic\" differences<br />\n\"...all differences must be<br />\nperceived; the perceptions<br />\nthemselves are socially<br />\nlearned; the way the<br />\ndistinction between<br />\nso-called basic and other<br />\ndifferences is conceived is<br />\nitself an artifact of learned<br />\nsocial perception.\"<br />\nfrom other (socially learned)<br />\ndifferences. But we cannot afford<br />\nto forget that all differences must<br />\nbe perceived; that the<br />\nperceptions themselves are<br />\nsocially learned; and that the way<br />\nthe distinction between so-called<br />\nbasic and other differences is<br />\nconceived is itself an artifact of<br />\nlearned social perception. It is for<br />\nthis reason that we cannot<br />\nreadily accept--nor should<br />\nwe--the idea that, if redheaded<br />\nchildren performed differently<br />\non tests from blackhaired<br />\nchildren, the difference might be<br />\nrooted in \"some basic<br />\ndifference.\" But; then, why does<br />\nthe idea come so readily to mind,<br />\nwhen dealing with males and<br />\nfemales, blacks and whites, and<br />\nother counterposed groups?<br />\nSurely there is some reason to<br />\nsuppose that the persuasiveness<br />\nof a \"basic difference\" notion is<br />\npositively correlated with the<br />\nlevel of challenge a \"group\"<br />\nappears to be making to an<br />\nexisting distribution of privilege.<br />\nI suppose that I--and, I trust,<br />\nmany anthropologists like.<br />\nme--might feel more comfortable<br />\nwith speculations about intrinsic<br />\ndifferences if they did not rise to<br />\nthe surface in such a curious way,<br />\nand particularly in areas where<br />\nour reliable sociological<br />\nknowledge remains quite<br />\nimperfect.<br />\nNeedless to add, none of these<br />\nremarks is meant to reflect<br />\ncritically on the research of Drs.<br />\nStanley, Fox and Hogan, which is<br />\nclearly revealing a great deal<br />\nabout the nature of intelligence,<br />\nthe pedagogical process, and the<br />\nsocial implications of precocity.<br />\nIt is meant instead to raise a<br />\ngeneral question as to why<br />\npopular thinking about the<br />\nindividual and the group, the<br />\nnature of groups, and the nature<br />\nof culture continues to remain<br />\nquite unchanged, in spite of half<br />\na century of honest attempts to<br />\ndocument its limitations and<br />\npoint out its dangers.<br />\nDr. Sidney<br />\nW.

It is a completed<br />\ntransaction, an executed<br />\ncontract, in the words of Dick<br />\nCook: \"A lack of an issue.\"<br />\nWhen I walked into the lobby of<br />\nthe Baltimorean in the afternoon,<br />\nand began asking questions as to<br />\nthe nature and timing of the<br />\ntransition, the manager walked<br />\nup to me and began to give me a<br />\nvery stiff, curt series of replies.<br />\n\"If you have any questions, the<br />\nman you want is Mr. Heist, in the<br />\nUniversity Housing Office of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.\" It was no<br />\nrunaround. There was simply<br />\nnothing to say. The Baltimorean,<br />\nsir, has been sold.<br />\nif I have learned one thing<br />\nabout Baltimore, it is that the<br />\nreal essence of anything in this<br />\ntown is not to be found within<br />\nmundane experience, but within<br />\nthe odd places, at odd hours.<br /><br />\nThis observation led me to the<br />\ninescapable conclusion that the<br />\nonly way I was going to get any<br />\nhuman feedback on the sale of<br />\nthe Baltimorean was to walk into<br />\nthe lobby and talk to someone,<br />\nbut after midnight. \u2022<br />\nShe was a middle-age woman,<br />\nwith black hair, wearing the same<br />\nglasses you see on everyone who<br />\nnever heard of fashion. She<br />\nstared at me for nearly a minute<br />\nbefore letting me in with the buzzer. I wondered again if it had<br />\nmade much sense to tackle this<br />\nassignment wearing my leather<br />\njacket. \"I'm a student from<br />\nHopkins,\" I said. But would that<br />\nintroduction put her at ease?<br />\nShe sat in an enclosed section<br />\nof the lobby, by the switchboard.<br />\nAs I walked towards her, she<br />\nturned to her right as if to talk to<br />\nsomeone. \"Someone\" was a late<br />\nnight television movie she<br />\nobviously wasn't really watching<br /><br />\nanyway, but to whom she had to<br />\nnod _acknowledgment to before<br />\nshe fully directed her attention<br />\nto me. I asked her if any Hopkins<br />\nstudents had moved in yet.<br />\n\"No,\" she replied, in a very<br />\nclear, high-pitched tone that had<br />\nno levity. \"They don't start any<br />\nmoving in till April 1st, I think.(Hopkins students start moving<br />\nin in September) People had<br />\nalready begun to move out, she<br />\nsaid. Some of them had lived in<br />\nthe hotel a long time--one woman<br />\nforty years. \"It's a damn<br />\nshame,\"she said,\"But I guess the<br />\nstudents have to have a place to<br />\nlive, though I can't understand<br />\nwhy the school can't build the<br />\nbuildings. They have the<br />\nmoney.\" But she was quick to<br />\npoint out that,\"most of the folks<br />\ndon't have no problem moving.<br />\nThey all got money, and money<br />\ntalks, y'know.\" One couple<br />\nthough: The wife had chronic<br /><br />\narthritis, and the husband had<br />\nbeen hospitalized several times,<br />\nwith hearftrouble. It isn't always<br />\neasy.<br />\nShe and the. rest of the staff<br />\nwould be leaving soon.<br />\nThe lobby at the Baltimorean<br />\nis pleasant, quiet and a pervasive<br />\nblue that should not be<br />\ndestroyed. It will be though. The<br />\nwhole lobby will be changed.<br />\n\"Just like the Belvedere. You<br />\nknow it, on Charles and Chase? It<br />\nused to be the finest hotel in<br />\nBaltimore.

The Middies led at half-time<br />\nby fourteen points but a<br />\npersistent Hopkins offense<br /><br />\nnarrowed the margin to nine with<br />\ntwo minutes to go. Forced to<br />\nfoul in order to regain possession<br />\nof the ball, the Hopkins<br />\nhoopsters were hurt when the<br />\nfree throws were converted by<br />\nNavy. The victory margin was<br />\nseventeen points but, in reality, it<br />\nwas a much closer game.<br />\nCommenting on Hopkins'<br />\ngames against Division I schools,<br />\nCoach Rupert said, \"It is a<br /><br />\nSwimmers outscored by LaSalle<br />\nBy BRUCE FOX<br />\nDespite excellent individual<br />\nperformances, the Hopkins' swim<br />\nteam was outscored Wednesday<br />\nnight by its formidable<br />\nOpponents at LaSalle 69-44. The<br />\nJays and the Explorers continued<br />\ntheir outstanding rivalry which<br />\nbegan two years ago with a 58-55<br />\nvictory going to Hopkins,<br />\nfollowed last year with a win for<br />\nLaSalle by the identical score.<br />\nThe meet began with LaSalle<br />\nrunning away with the 400-yard<br />\nmedley relay while, in the<br />\nprocess, Hopkins' Dean<br />\nBuchenauer swam his best career<br />\n100-yard breaststroke leg in<br />\n1:02.4. This was followed by a<br />\none-two showing in the<br />\n1000-yard freestyle for freshmen<br />\nTodd Russell and Frank<br />\nMcGovern, two ot the many<br />\nexcellent rookies on the Jays'<br />\nsquad. Their times of 10:34.6<br />\nand 10:36.4 were both individual<br />\nhighs.<br />\nCaptain Jim Spiering went on<br />\nto place third in the 200-yard<br />\nfreestyle with an excellent time<br />\nof 1:48.9 which qualifies him for<br />\nthe Division III national<br />\nchampionships to be held in<br />\nMarch.<br />\nThe 200-yard individual<br />\nmedley followed and turned out<br />\nto be one of the most exciting<br />\nevents of the evening. The event<br />\nwas won by freshman Mike Bay<br />\nat 2:02.5 but it was senior Bob<br />\nStoever who made it a thriller.<br />\nWith 50 yards remaining, Stoever<br />\nwas in fourth place, 1-1/2 body<br />\nlengths behind two LaSalle<br />\nswimmers. \"Smokey\", however,<br />\nturned it on and touched before<br />\nhis two rivals knew what<br />\nhappened, to take second with a<br /><br />\ntime of 2:04.96!<br />\nFreshman Mike DiCio<br />\ndisplayed his steady<br />\nimprovement in the diving<br />\ncompetition as he finished first in<br />\nthe one-meter and second in the<br />\nthree-meter event. This was<br />\nfollowed by an easier victory for<br />\nStoever in the 200-yard butterfly<br />\nas he won by two seconds. An<br />\nexcellent time was also turned in<br />\nby Frank McGovern in this event<br />\nconsidering that he had<br />\ncompeted in the grueling<br />\n1000-yard freestyle earlier.<br />\nMike Bay continued his string<br />\nof excellent performances by<br />\nrunning away with the 200- yard<br />\nbackstroke. His time of 1:57.59<br />\nbroke his own university record<br />\nset in December which had been<br />\nposted as the top time for this<br />\nevent in both Divisions II and III<br />\nthis year. Jim Spiering then<br />\ntallied a career best time of 49.2<br />\nin the 100-yard freestyle, placing<br />\nthird.<br />\nTodd Russell took second in<br />\nthe 500-yard freestyle as Eric<br />\nHorning registered his best time<br />\nof 5:11 finishing fourth. Dean<br />\nBuchenauer went on to take<br />\nthird in the 200-yard<br />\nbreaststroke with a time of<br />\n2:19.4, which just missed<br />\nqualifying him for the national<br />\nchampionships.<br />\nIn all, thirteen career best<br />\ntimes were turned in but<br />\nnonetheless LaSalle proved too<br />\noverpowering this year.<br />\nSpecial credit goes to Frank<br />\nMcGovern who, in swimming the<br />\n\"big triple\", (200-yard butterfly<br />\nand the 1000 and 500-yard<br />\nfreestyles), set two personal<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThis gives the Blue Jays a 4-4<br /><br />\nrecord with a tough meet coming<br />\nup tomorrow against a strong<br />\nAmerican University team whom<br />\nHopkins beat here last year.<br />\nThe women's swim team put<br />\nan unofficial lock on the<br />\nwomen's MAC swim title<br />\nyesterday when they defeated<br />\nthe defending champs from<br />\nUrsinus College in the Bears<br />\nhome pool, 55-40.

He sank them both and<br />\nUrsinus took the ensuing<br />\ninbounds pass downcourt for a<br />\nbucket with a Blue Jay foul on<br />\nthe play. At this time the refs<br />\nwere approached by Coach<br />\nWarren Fry of Ursinus who<br />\nclaimd that Dean Uhler was the<br />\nvictim of the prior Stubits foul<br />\nand should have shot, not Paytas.<br />\nThe referees ruled that the game<br />\nwould be stopped and Uhler<br />\nwould \"re-shoot\" the foul.<br />\nFortunately, Dean hit both and<br />\nno further adjustments were<br />\nmade by the officials.<br />\nDespite being physically tired<br />\nfrom the grueling game at Navy,<br />\ngood performances were turned<br />\nin by Andy Scheinfeld who had<br />\n18 points and 11 rebounds; Dean<br />\nUhler with 17 points, 10<br />\nrebounds and four blocked shots;<br />\nand John Finston who chipped in<br />\nwith 12 points and 9 caroms.<br />\nAfter a week's respite the<br />\nvarsity cagers next battle<br />\nSwarthmore next Thursday at<br />\nthe Athletic Center.

This year's<br />\nseason began on Jan. 26 and will<br />\ncontinue through the end of<br />\nMarch. There have been no major<br />\nupsets so far among the 9 dorm,<br />\n6 frat, and 24 independent teams<br />\nthat comprise the 4 leagues.<br />\nFavorites<br />\nAfter 3 games, the early<br />\nfavorites among the independents<br />\nare Face the Music, led by Ian<br />\nMcKechnie and John Jerabeck,<br />\nand Dream Merchants,<br />\nquarterbacked by Brett Miles and<br />\nGene Killeavy, with the<br />\nundefeated Barnstormers looking<br />\nlike,a sleeper.<br /><br />\nvaluable educational experience<br />\nfor our players. We realize that<br />\nstudents come to Hopkins for it's<br />\nacademics but we also try and<br />\nmake varsity basketball a<br />\nrewarding experience for our<br />\nplayers.

Last night's game with<br />\nUrsinus was embroiled in<br />\ncontroversy though it turned out<br />\nto be meaningless as the Jays<br />\ncame away with an 82-68<br />\nvictory.<br /><br />\np.m., weigh-ins from 6-7.
