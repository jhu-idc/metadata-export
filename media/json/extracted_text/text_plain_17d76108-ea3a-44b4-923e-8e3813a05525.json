Refusing to<br />\ntake a cut, Markels stood on<br />\nprinciple, citing the recent leap<br />\nin printing costs and the importance of the magazine's appearance. Although no one could<br />\ndispute the quality of the paper<br />\nand the printing in last year's<br />\nissue, the necessity of such a<br />\nslick effort was dubious. Markel's proposal was unanimously<br />\nrejected, leaving the magazine<br />\npenniless.<br />\nAs this year's editor of<br />\nEllipsis, I will request a reconsideration of the budget in order<br />\nfor Ellipsis to continue its<br />\nfunction as a forum for the<br />\nliterary accomplishments of the<br />\nHopkins community.

The prospective Hopkins undergrad is more<br />\nconcerned with the criteria Admissions looks for than<br />\nthe presently enrolled student is, and understandably<br />\nso. Nevertheless, the kinds of students that are accepted<br />\nand enroll at JHU significantly affects both the academic<br />\nand non-academic education one receives at Hopkins.<br />\nOver the past ten years(and particularly within<br />\nthe last two) as the quality and distribution of entering<br />\nstudents have changed,so has the quality of education at<br />\nHopkins. The Office of Admissions has been responsible in part for these improvements, and a look at the<br />\nprocesses of that office might yield some insight into<br />\nhow these changes are formulated and effected.<br />\n<br />\nnize the four-page form that next year's freshman will<br />\nhave to complete.

Two years later it<br />\nwas reinstated and has remained an important part of<br />\nthe application since then.

Again, a student who has<br />\nenrolled at another college or university will not be<br />\nfavored over the student who has not, solely on this one<br />\ncriterion. The Admissions Office will simply have a<br />\nbetter idea about the former's potential, which in some<br />\ncases might be less than that of a student applying<br />\nwithout college credits.<br />\nMany students assume that being related to an<br />\nalumnus automatically secures admittance to a university, regardless of his or her grades. In the case of alumni<br />\nrelatives at Hopkins, according to Bill White, \"Family<br />\nties are so strong that they need to be considered in the<br />\nadmissions process. If a student looks like he will<br />\nacheive here (at Hopkins) he'll be accepted even if he is<br />\nnot competitive (in his high school career up to this<br />\npoint).\" Alumni services to the university is taken into<br />\nconsideration just as much as contributions made;<br />\nfamilies can't \"buy\" places for students. It is important<br />\nto note that Hopkins has no quota system for relatives<br />\nof alumni. All students must be able to satisfy Hopkins<br />\nrequirements in order to be accepted.<br />\nWhile the factors discussed up to this point can<br />\ninfluence desicions in a specific instance, the Admissions<br />\nOffice is more concerned with the factors in a student's<br />\nlife that she has control over; the questions in the second<br />\nhalf of the application form are directed at finding out<br />\nabout a student's personality and interests.<br />\nThe applicant's chosen field of study determines<br />\nto some degree how his application is evaluated. Because half of all the applications Hopkins receives<br />\nare from pre-meds, the competition in science-related<br />\nfields is obviously tougher. The Admissions Committee<br />\nlooks for a strong math and science background as well<br />\nas well as a proficiency in other disciplines. With liberal<br />\narts candidates, science and math are downplayed and<br />\nstrength in the area of concentration, as well as a good<br />\noverall consistency as a student are emphasized.<br />\nThe application also contains a question regarding a student's career goal, which is not always evident<br />\ngiven his indicated area of interest. Sometimes a student<br />\ndeclares himself a Humanities major when instead he<br />\nintends to study medicine. By requesting a potential<br />\nfreshman's professional objectives, the staff and faculty<br />\ninvolved in the admissions process can bett 3r judge, from<br />\nhis past record, how well a student will acheive at<br />\nHopkins in that area.<br />\nOddly enough, the sheer numbei of extracurricular activities a student lists on her application is<br />\nimportant in itself. Here, admissions looks for the<br />\nlength and quality of a student's contributions to the<br />\norganizations she has been involved in. For example,<br />\na student who has been active in one organization or<br />\nactivity for a long period of time and has played a major<br />\nrole in the direction of this group would be considered<br />\nmore favorably than one who belonged to eight different<br />\norganizations and contributed relatively little to any.<br />\nThe last questions in the application are more<br />\ngeneral in their scope and require more writing on the<br />\napplicant's part. The Admissions Office is looking for<br />\nany qualities that would identify the applicant as an<br />\nindividual. By allowing the student to discuss his<br />\nemployment experiences, outside interests, and his goals<br />\nfor the future, the committee members get a better and<br />\nfuller understanding of a student's character. The longer<br />\nessay question at the end of the application is, as Executive Assistant to Dean Hall, Anita Prentice, puts it, \"a<br />\ngentle one\";the student is asked to write about anything<br />\nthat is of interest to himself, or that he feels the Admissions Office should know. These essays range in form<br />\nfrom letters and descriptions of personal experiences<br />\nto papers written for a class on some topic of special<br />\nconcern. In addition to any personal information they<br />\ncan obtain, the Admissions Office is looking at a student's ability to express himself articulately, a skill they<br />\nfeel is found less frequently in high school and culege<br />\nstudents these days.<br />\n<br />\n\fthe top of their classes.., and on that basis look very<br />\nmuch alike.

At<br />\nsome point we're going to need to accept more people,<br />\nbut those individual groups are having a difficult time<br />\njust drawing some distinctions; they've been looking at<br />\nthem too long.\" At that point the professional staff<br />\nmembers and Schnydman take the remaining folders and<br />\nmake the last necassary distinctions. The number of<br />\ns'udents finally accepted is based on the quality of the<br />\napplicant pool, the number of students accepted and<br />\nenrolled the previous year, and the number of students<br />\ndesired for each area of study.<br />\nWhat is the Admissions Committee looking for?<br />\nAccording to Schnydman,\"No one (aspect of a<br />\nstudent's folder) is more important to the exclusion of<br />\nall others.

We are going to look at the standardized tests that<br />\nwe require (SAT's and three achievement tests).<br />\nThere is no set order of importance for the<br />\ninformation Admissions looks at. Achievement tests<br />\ndon't always supercede letters of recommendation,<br />\nand SAT scores always come after grades. \"Usually<br />\ngrades are the most important criteria,\" said Schnydman, \"but the SAT's are... immensely useful to us<br />\nwhen we have a certain number of people who are all at<br />\n<br />\nstudent who applied describing life for black stduents on<br />\ncampus. He, aided by members of the Black Student's<br />\nUnion, also called every black student in the continental<br />\nUSA who was accepted for 80-81, to congratulate him<br />\nor her and to invite the student to visit Hopkins. Several<br />\nmembers of the B.S.U. offered to house the students,<br />\nshowed them around campus and invited them to sit in<br />\non classes. The combined efforts of the students and<br />\nadministration were well rewarded; the number of<br />\nentering minority students has doubled since last year,<br />\nraising the percentage to six (last year's freshman class<br />\nconatined only three percent). As Director Schnydman<br />\nsaid, \"we want more female and more black students,<br />\nbut we want more quality female and more quality black<br />\nstudents.\" That is, in part. what Hopkins got this year.<br />\nTHE CLASS OF 1984<br />\nOver the past couple of years many colleges and<br />\nuniversities across the country have been struggling to<br />\nkeep enrollment from decreasing. This year, however.<br />\nHopkins has an unexpected \"bumper crop\" of freshmen<br />\nwith approximately 643 students expected to register<br />\nfor classes. The Admissions Office is pleased, if a little<br />\nbaffled, by its overall success. Not only is this the<br />\nlargest class of incoming freshmen ever matriculated, it is<br />\nalso one of the brightest, statistically anyway. with 89<br />\nof the students ranking in the top fifth of their classes<br />\nand having mean SAT scores of 627 verbal and 673<br />\nmath. Interestingly enough, the number of pre-meds<br />\nhas been decreasing recently; this year's class has respectively smaller and larger numbers of pre-med and humanities students than any other class over the past ten<br />\nyears.

Again, a student who has<br />\nenrolled at another college or university will not be<br />\nfavored over the student who has not, solely on this one<br />\ncriterion. The Admissions Office will simply have a<br />\nbetter idea about the former's potential, which in some<br />\ncases might be less than that of a student applying<br />\nwithout college credits.<br />\nMany students assume that being related to an<br />\nalumnus automatically secures admittance to a university, regardless of his or her grades. In the case of alumni<br />\nrelatives at Hopkins, according to Bill White, \"Family<br />\nties are so strong that they need to be considered in the<br />\nadmissions process. If a student looks like he will<br />\nacheive here (at Hopkins) he'll be accepted even if he is<br />\nnot competitive (in his high school career up to this<br />\npoint).\" Alumni services to the university is taken into<br />\nconsideration just as much as contributions made;<br />\nfamilies can't \"buy\" places for students. It is important<br />\nto note that Hopkins has no quota system for relatives<br />\nof alumni. All students must be able to satisfy Hopkins<br />\nrequirements in order to be accepted.<br />\nWhile the factors discussed up to this point can<br />\ninfluence desicions in a specific instance, the Admissions<br />\nOffice is more concerned with the factors in a student's<br />\nlife that she has control over; the questions in the second<br />\nhalf of the application form are directed at finding out<br />\nabout a student's personality and interests.<br />\nThe applicant's chosen field of study determines<br />\nto some degree how his application is evaluated. Because half of all the applications Hopkins receives<br />\nare from pre-meds, the competition in science-related<br />\nfields is obviously tougher. The Admissions Committee<br />\nlooks for a strong math and science background as well<br />\nas well as a proficiency in other disciplines. With liberal<br />\narts candidates, science and math are downplayed and<br />\nstrength in the area of concentration, as well as a good<br />\noverall consistency as a student are emphasized.<br />\nThe application also contains a question regarding a student's career goal, which is not always evident<br />\ngiven his indicated area of interest. Sometimes a student<br />\ndeclares himself a Humanities major when instead he<br />\nintends to study medicine. By requesting a potential<br />\nfreshman's professional objectives, the staff and faculty<br />\ninvolved in the admissions process can bett 3r judge, from<br />\nhis past record, how well a student will acheive at<br />\nHopkins in that area.<br />\nOddly enough, the sheer numbei of extracurricular activities a student lists on her application is<br />\nimportant in itself. Here, admissions looks for the<br />\nlength and quality of a student's contributions to the<br />\norganizations she has been involved in. For example,<br />\na student who has been active in one organization or<br />\nactivity for a long period of time and has played a major<br />\nrole in the direction of this group would be considered<br />\nmore favorably than one who belonged to eight different<br />\norganizations and contributed relatively little to any.<br />\nThe last questions in the application are more<br />\ngeneral in their scope and require more writing on the<br />\napplicant's part. The Admissions Office is looking for<br />\nany qualities that would identify the applicant as an<br />\nindividual. By allowing the student to discuss his<br />\nemployment experiences, outside interests, and his goals<br />\nfor the future, the committee members get a better and<br />\nfuller understanding of a student's character. The longer<br />\nessay question at the end of the application is, as Executive Assistant to Dean Hall, Anita Prentice, puts it, \"a<br />\ngentle one\";the student is asked to write about anything<br />\nthat is of interest to himself, or that he feels the Admissions Office should know. These essays range in form<br />\nfrom letters and descriptions of personal experiences<br />\nto papers written for a class on some topic of special<br />\nconcern. In addition to any personal information they<br />\ncan obtain, the Admissions Office is looking at a student's ability to express himself articulately, a skill they<br />\nfeel is found less frequently in high school and culege<br />\nstudents these days.<br /><br />\nthe top of their classes.., and on that basis look very<br />\nmuch alike.

The number of<br />\ns'udents finally accepted is based on the quality of the<br />\napplicant pool, the number of students accepted and<br />\nenrolled the previous year, and the number of students<br />\ndesired for each area of study.<br />\nWhat is the Admissions Committee looking for?<br />\nAccording to Schnydman,\"No one (aspect of a<br />\nstudent's folder) is more important to the exclusion of<br />\nall others.

Achievement tests<br />\ndon't always supercede letters of recommendation,<br />\nand SAT scores always come after grades. \"Usually<br />\ngrades are the most important criteria,\" said Schnydman, \"but the SAT's are... immensely useful to us<br />\nwhen we have a certain number of people who are all at<br /><br />\nstudent who applied describing life for black stduents on<br />\ncampus. He, aided by members of the Black Student's<br />\nUnion, also called every black student in the continental<br />\nUSA who was accepted for 80-81, to congratulate him<br />\nor her and to invite the student to visit Hopkins. Several<br />\nmembers of the B.S.U. offered to house the students,<br />\nshowed them around campus and invited them to sit in<br />\non classes. The combined efforts of the students and<br />\nadministration were well rewarded; the number of<br />\nentering minority students has doubled since last year,<br />\nraising the percentage to six (last year's freshman class<br />\nconatined only three percent).

The Admissions Office is pleased, if a little<br />\nbaffled, by its overall success. Not only is this the<br />\nlargest class of incoming freshmen ever matriculated, it is<br />\nalso one of the brightest, statistically anyway. with 89<br />\nof the students ranking in the top fifth of their classes<br />\nand having mean SAT scores of 627 verbal and 673<br />\nmath. Interestingly enough, the number of pre-meds<br />\nhas been decreasing recently; this year's class has respectively smaller and larger numbers of pre-med and humanities students than any other class over the past ten<br />\nyears.
