McKewen, '17, from its business<br />\nstaff.<br />\nThe New Absence Rules.<br />\n<br />\nThere is little doubt that,in protesting against the severity of the<br />\nnew rules regarding absences, the<br />\nStudent Council truly representsthe opinion of the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nbelieves that such a protest, uttered, not in the spirit of revolt,<br />\nbut in the spirit of appeal, merits<br />\nthe earnest consideration of. the<br />\nHopkins faculty.<br />\nIt is generally understood by<br />\nthe great majority of Hopkins stu(Milts that the new rules owe their<br />\npromulgation solely to the great<br />\nincrease which has come about in<br />\nthe University enrollment. Technically, even in the past, each student was supposed to attend every<br />\nclass in every ()Ile of his courses,<br />\nor to submit to his instructor a<br />\nlegitimate excuse. The unpleasad fact must be faced that the<br />\nleniency with which this requirement was interpreted, in the case<br />\nof a small minority of Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nmen, led to an amount of \"cutting\" which was a gross abuse of<br />\nthe laxity with which the rule<br />\nwas enforced. Undeniably, men<br />\nwho \"cut\" as a matter of habit<br />\nshould be made to pay the penalty\u2014in this premise, the great<br />\nmajority of students heartily<br />\nconcur.<br />\nAt the same time, it is undeniably true that; in the past, many<br />\nmen have cut one or two of their<br />\nclasses in a course without any<br />\ndetriment whatsoever to the character of the work which they were<br />\ndoing or to the grade which they<br />\nreceived. So much has this been<br />\nthe case that it had come to be regarded as an unwritten privilege<br />\n\u2014never, indeed, acknowledged by<br />\nthe faculty, but never. den<br />\n- ied by<br />\nthem\u2014that a man who was keeping well up in his work could absent himself from a class or two<br />\neach term without giving an explanation of his absence, and<br />\nwithout having his grade lowered.<br />\nNor was this unwritten privilege<br />\nregarded by the students so much<br />\nas an excuse for \"cutting\" as<br />\nmerely a manifestation of the<br />\ngreater freedom of action which<br />\nattendance at a University is generally supposed to bring.<br />\nIt is the abridgement of this<br />\nfreedom which the students resent more than the actual rule itself. Yet, there also enters into<br />\nthe ciuestion the fact that a man<br />\nmay not go to a class for a reason which, entirely legitimate in<br />\nitself, is too personal to be submitted to a faculty board. In<br />\nsuch cases\u2014and the cases undoubtedly do exist\u2014it does not<br />\nseem quite necessary that, even<br />\nthough he has made up the work<br />\nwhich he has missed, the man's<br />\nmark for the term should still be<br />\nlowered.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, therefore, respectfully submits for the consideration of the faculty the following amendment to the rules:<br />\nLet Rule 3 be made to read:<br />\n\"After the second unexcused absence, the absences will count<br />\nagainst the student's mark in the<br />\nsubject concerned. If his work in<br />\nthe subject is below 8, every such<br />\nabsence will be counted.\"<br />\nSuch an amendment would not<br />\naffect fhe efficacy of the rules in<br />\nguarding against the evil which<br />\nthey strive to prevent, and, at the<br />\nsame time, would remove every<br />\nshadow of justification for' the student body's failure to appreciate<br />\nthe necessity of their enforcement.<br />\nMoreover, under such an amend-<br />\n<br />\nnot only accepts reality calmly,<br />\nbut would be very curious to<br />\nknoW why he should not accept<br />\nit calmly, and what on earth he<br />\nshould want else.<br />\nAt the present time, there are<br />\nexactly two movements launched<br />\nby men in colleges which are sufficiently opposed to the trend of<br />\nevents to make even eddies in the<br />\nnational current.

Thus only shall we<br />\nmake a contribution to the intellectual agencies of this country,<br />\nand add a positive gain to American learning and education in the<br />\nsecond century of the Republic.<br />\nThe tenor of my remarks has<br />\nimplied perhaps more diversity of<br />\nopinion than really exists in respect to universities. The truth<br />\nis, most institutions are not.free<br />\nto build anew; they can only readjust. It has been playfully said<br />\nthat \"traditions and conditions\"<br />\nimpede their progress. But whatever may be the concrete difficulties on many abstract principles<br />\nthere is little need of controversy.<br />\nOur effort will be to accept that<br />\nwhich is determined \u2014 to avoid<br />\nthat which is obsolescent, to study<br />\nthat which is doubtful\u2014\"slowly<br />\nmaking haste.\"<br />\n<br />\nThere is no better way, The News-Letter deems, of commemorating the forty-first anniversary of the founding of the<br />\nUniversity\u2014an anniversary to which the removal to Homewood<br />\ngives epoch-making significance\u2014than by publishing the inaugural<br />\naddress of the University's first president.<br />\nThe part which Daniel Coit Gilman played in the conception<br />\nand development of the Johns Hopkins University is told, in better<br />\nwords than we can command, by his biographer, Fabian Franklin:<br />\n\"His was the co-ordinating mind and the decisive voice in the<br />\nshaping of the University's character and the determination of its<br />\npolicies. The policy of taking time to permit the beginnings to<br />\ndevelop,.of letting the University grow into its true self rather<br />\nthan forcing it into a rigid mold, appealed to him particularly; and<br />\nit is to the combination of the caution involved in this policy and<br />\nthe boldness of his fundamental purpose that the signal success<br />\nachieved by the University from the beginning must be ascribed.\"<br />\nWhat is reproduced on this page is only a part of that<br />\nfirst inaugural address; but it is sufficient to show clearly the<br />\nideals which the Johns Hopkins was created to fulfill\u2014the ideals<br />\nwhich must continue to guide the University in the future, as they<br />\nhave guided it in the past.<br />\nIs, then, anything settled in respect to university education?<br />\nMuch, very much. Can we draw<br />\na statement of what is agreed<br />\nupon? At any rate we can try.<br />\nThe schedule will include twelve<br />\npoints on which there seems to be<br />\na general agreement.<br />\n1. All sciences are worthy of<br />\npromotion; or in other words, it<br />\nis useless to dispute whether literature or science should receive<br />\nmost attention, or whether there<br />\nis any essential difference between<br />\nthe old and the new education.<br />\n2. Religion has nothing to fear<br />\nfrom science, and science need not<br />\nbe afraid of religion. Religion<br />\nclaims to interpret the word of<br />\nGod, and science reveals the laws<br />\nof God. The ' interpreters may<br />\n<br />\nblunder, but truths are immutable, eternal and never in conflict.<br />\n3. Remote utility is quite as<br />\nworthy to be thought of as immediate advantage. Those ventures are not always most sagacious that expect a return on the<br />\nmorrow. It sometimes pays to<br />\nsend our argosies across the seas;<br />\nto make investments with an eye<br />\nto slow but sure returns. So is it<br />\nalways in the promotion of science.<br />\n4. As it is impossible for any<br />\nuniversity to encourage with<br />\nequal freedom all branches of<br />\nlearning, a selection must be made<br />\nby enlightened governors, and<br />\nthat selection must depend on the<br />\nrequirements and deficiencies of a<br />\ngiven people, in a given period.<br />\n<br />\nDANIEL COIT GILMAN<br />\n<br />\nThere is no absolute standard of<br />\npreference. What is more important at one time or in one place<br />\nmay be less needed elsewhere and<br />\notherwise.<br />\n5. Individual students cannot<br />\npursue all branches of learning,<br />\nand must be allowed to select,<br />\nunder the guidance of those who<br />\nare appointed to counsel them.<br />\nNor can able professors be governed by routine. Teachers and<br />\npupils must be allowed great freedom in their method of work.<br />\nRecitations, lectures, examinations, laboratories, libraries, field<br />\nexercises, travels, \u2022are all legitimate means of culture.<br />\n6. The best scholars will almost<br />\ninvariably be those who make special attainments on the foundation of a broad and liberal culture.<br />\n7. The best teachers are usually<br />\nthose who are free, competent,<br />\nand willing to make original researches in the library and the<br />\nlaboratory.<br />\n8. The best investigators are<br />\nusually those who have also the<br />\nresponsibilities of instruction,<br />\ngaining thus the incitement of<br />\ncolleagues, the encouragement of<br />\npupils, the observation of the public.<br />\n9. Universities should bestow<br />\ntheir honors with a sparing hand;<br />\ntheir benefits most freely.<br />\n10. A university cannot be created in a day; it is a slow growth.<br />\nThe University of Berlin has been<br />\nquoted as a proof of the contrary.<br />\nThat was indeed a quick success,<br />\nbut in an old, compact country,<br />\ncrowded with learned men eager<br />\nto assemble at the Prussian court.<br />\nIt was a change of base rather<br />\nthan a sudden development.<br />\n11. The object of the university<br />\nis to develop character\u2014to make<br />\nmen. It misses its aim if it produces learned pedants, or simple<br />\nartisans, or cunning sophists, or<br />\npretentious practitioners. Its purport is not so much to impart<br />\nknowledge to the pupils as to<br />\nwhet the appetite, exhibit methods, develop powers, strengthen<br />\njudgment, and invigorate the intellectual and moral forces. It<br />\nshould prepare for the service of<br />\nsociety a class of students who<br />\nwill be wise, thoughtful, progressive guides in whatever department of 'work or thought they<br />\nmay be engaged.<br />\n12. Universities easily fall into<br />\nruts. Almost every epoch requires<br />\na fresh start.<br />\nIf these twelve points are conceded, our task is simplified,<br />\nthough it is still difficult. It is<br />\nto apply these principles to Baltimore in 1876.<br />\nWe are trying to do this with<br />\nno controversy as to the relative<br />\nimportance of letters and science,<br />\nthe conflicts of religion and science, or the relation of abstracContinued on gage 6. col. 1)<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, FEBRUARY 26, 1917.<br />\n<br />\n\"SINCERITY AND INTEGRITY\"<br />\n<br />\nJudge Harlan went on to show CLUBS GIVE ORIGINAL PROGRAM<br />\nthat politics is the field of many<br />\nJudge Harlan Tells Hopkins Students lawyers.

The delegates<br />\nwill be,entertained at no expense<br />\nduring the entire stay at Annapolis. The number of delegates is<br />\nlimited, and any men who wish to<br />\ngo are requested to hand their<br />\n\\names to Paul Sutton or Allan<br />\nK.

Think it over,<br />\ngentlemen; we should much prefer to, retain your friendship.<br />\n'17.<br />\nFebruary.22, 1917.\u2022<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014In a recent issue THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER put itself editorially upon record as wondering why<br />\nthe undergraduate body of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University would<br />\npersist in calling the institution<br />\na \"school.\" Have not the events<br />\nof the past week amply answered<br />\nthis query?<br />\nI refer, of course, to the rules<br />\nannounced by the faculty concerning lateness and absence from<br />\nclasses. Aside from the lack of<br />\ntact, to say the least, with which<br />\nthe new ruling was announced<br />\n(it is, as it stands, clearly ex post<br />\nfacto; a method now in disrepute<br />\namong more progressive legislators), its spirit is unworthy of a<br />\nuniversity. The members of the<br />\nfaculty had, no doubt, their own<br />\ngood reasons for promulgating<br />\ntheir edict; but could not the<br />\n\"cutting\" problem have been<br />\ndealt with in a less drastic manner? Unless I am misinformed,<br />\nit is the custom at most universities to allow a certain number of<br />\nunexcused absences from each<br />\nclass. This number is not necessarily large; nor is it probable<br />\nthat a student will lose any very<br />\nvital part of a course by absenting himself from it three or four<br />\ndays during the year.<br />\nIt is hard to see why some rule<br />\nmore of this nature can not be<br />\nadopted at Hopkins. Excessive<br />\n\"cutting\" is certainly an evil, and<br />\nthere were doubtless some few<br />\nstudents who abused the old tacit<br />\nunderstanding that two or three<br />\nunexcused absences each term<br />\nwould not seriously affect the<br />\nstudent's term mark; but is the<br />\nwhole student body to be made to<br />\nsuffer for these few?<br />\nThe whole question, moreover,<br />\nresolves itself, not into one of<br />\npower, but one of tact. The undoybted right of the faculty to<br />\ngovern in its own way can not be<br />\nquestioned. The faculty can do<br />\nanything \u2014 it has full power to<br />\n\"fire\" the whole undergraduate<br />\nbody it it sees fit. But the point<br />\nis, can it afford to antagonize the<br />\nundergraduates? Most of the Seniors would probably prefer to remain at the University, even under unpleasant conditions, since<br />\nonly about three more months remain for them here. But it is<br />\nquite conceivable that underclassmen, resenting the needless<br />\nembarrassment of explaining to<br />\n<br />\nMurad advertising understates<br />\nrather than exaggerates.<br />\nNOW,USTEN!<br />\nThe principal difference between Murad and<br />\nmost 25 Cent cigarettes<br />\nis Quality \u2014 in favor of<br />\nMurad.<br />\n<br />\nREMEMBER\u2014<br />\n'Turkish tobacco is<br />\nthe world's most<br />\nfamous tobacco for<br />\ncigarettes.<br />\n<br />\nPresents Another Objection.<br />\n<br />\nNEws-Lwrrzs:<br />\nSir\u2014The ear of the faculty<br />\nshould not be deaf to the widespread spirit of protest which<br />\nhas been occasioned by the announcement of the new regulations regarding absences from<br />\nclasses, especially since the remarks of protest come from the<br />\nstudent body as a whole.<br />\nIt is the opinion of most broadminded colleges and universities<br />\nthat when a man is old enough to<br />\nenter the doors of these institutions he should also be old enough<br />\nTo the Editor of THE<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 26, 1917.<br />\nto have a certain responsibility<br />\nin matters of personal conduct.<br />\n\u2022 It is perfectly conceivable that<br />\nmost students who are in our own<br />\nUniversity have sense enough to<br />\nknow whether they can \"cut\" a<br />\nclass without falling back in<br />\ntheir work,,even though their excuse might not seem an excuse<br />\nin the eyes. of another person.<br />\nAnd I believe that most persons<br />\nwill agree that the average student can have two or three of<br />\nthese unexcused tuts during a<br />\nterm without affecting his work<br />\nin the least.<br />\nA self-supporting student naturally has outFide interests<br />\nwhich may keep him away from<br />\na class occasionally, and it will<br />\nbe extremely distasteful, I am<br />\nsure, for him to have to appear<br />\nbefore a committee of the faculty<br />\nand explain the \"ins and outs\"<br />\nof his entirely personal matters<br />\nin order to save his mark from<br />\nbeing unjustly lowered at the end<br />\nof the term.

The editor's request was<br />\ntimely, as everything possible is<br />\nbeing done to turn it into a kindergarten.<br />\nA short time ago we were men,<br />\ncapable of taking care of ourselves. Now, on account of our<br />\nage, perhaps, we are considered<br />\nincapable and our mode of conduct is being strictly regulated by<br />\nwritten rules.<br />\nShould we have all sorts of prohibitions and restrictions put on<br />\nus, not only without having any<br />\nsay in the matter, but without<br />\nany regard to our opinion? The<br />\neffects of the new laws fall on the<br />\nstudents, and they should have<br />\nhad official representatives-at any<br />\n<br />\nmeeting to make them. What is<br />\nmore, they are ex post facto laws.<br />\nThey went into effect about a<br />\nweek before anyone knew about<br />\nthem.<br />\nThe argument that the innocent<br />\nmust suffer with the guilty might<br />\nbe brought up. This should not<br />\nhold in this case. I would venture<br />\nto say that there are not more than<br />\ntwenty men out of the three hundred that take courses here who<br />\nhabitually \"cut\" or come late to<br />\nclasses. Every one of these men<br />\nshould be dealt with as he deserves. But prep school methods<br />\nshould not be adopted for the<br />\nwhole University.

McKewen, '17, from its business<br />\nstaff.<br />\nThe New Absence Rules.<br /><br />\nThere is little doubt that,in protesting against the severity of the<br />\nnew rules regarding absences, the<br />\nStudent Council truly representsthe opinion of the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body. THE NEWS-LETTER<br />\nbelieves that such a protest, uttered, not in the spirit of revolt,<br />\nbut in the spirit of appeal, merits<br />\nthe earnest consideration of. the<br />\nHopkins faculty.<br />\nIt is generally understood by<br />\nthe great majority of Hopkins stu(Milts that the new rules owe their<br />\npromulgation solely to the great<br />\nincrease which has come about in<br />\nthe University enrollment. Technically, even in the past, each student was supposed to attend every<br />\nclass in every ()Ile of his courses,<br />\nor to submit to his instructor a<br />\nlegitimate excuse. The unpleasad fact must be faced that the<br />\nleniency with which this requirement was interpreted, in the case<br />\nof a small minority of Hopkins<br /><br />\nmen, led to an amount of \"cutting\" which was a gross abuse of<br />\nthe laxity with which the rule<br />\nwas enforced. Undeniably, men<br />\nwho \"cut\" as a matter of habit<br />\nshould be made to pay the penalty\u2014in this premise, the great<br />\nmajority of students heartily<br />\nconcur.<br />\nAt the same time, it is undeniably true that; in the past, many<br />\nmen have cut one or two of their<br />\nclasses in a course without any<br />\ndetriment whatsoever to the character of the work which they were<br />\ndoing or to the grade which they<br />\nreceived. So much has this been<br />\nthe case that it had come to be regarded as an unwritten privilege<br />\n\u2014never, indeed, acknowledged by<br />\nthe faculty, but never. den<br />\n- ied by<br />\nthem\u2014that a man who was keeping well up in his work could absent himself from a class or two<br />\neach term without giving an explanation of his absence, and<br />\nwithout having his grade lowered.<br />\nNor was this unwritten privilege<br />\nregarded by the students so much<br />\nas an excuse for \"cutting\" as<br />\nmerely a manifestation of the<br />\ngreater freedom of action which<br />\nattendance at a University is generally supposed to bring.<br />\nIt is the abridgement of this<br />\nfreedom which the students resent more than the actual rule itself. Yet, there also enters into<br />\nthe ciuestion the fact that a man<br />\nmay not go to a class for a reason which, entirely legitimate in<br />\nitself, is too personal to be submitted to a faculty board. In<br />\nsuch cases\u2014and the cases undoubtedly do exist\u2014it does not<br />\nseem quite necessary that, even<br />\nthough he has made up the work<br />\nwhich he has missed, the man's<br />\nmark for the term should still be<br />\nlowered.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, therefore, respectfully submits for the consideration of the faculty the following amendment to the rules:<br />\nLet Rule 3 be made to read:<br />\n\"After the second unexcused absence, the absences will count<br />\nagainst the student's mark in the<br />\nsubject concerned. If his work in<br />\nthe subject is below 8, every such<br />\nabsence will be counted.\"<br />\nSuch an amendment would not<br />\naffect fhe efficacy of the rules in<br />\nguarding against the evil which<br />\nthey strive to prevent, and, at the<br />\nsame time, would remove every<br />\nshadow of justification for' the student body's failure to appreciate<br />\nthe necessity of their enforcement.<br />\nMoreover, under such an amend-<br /><br />\nnot only accepts reality calmly,<br />\nbut would be very curious to<br />\nknoW why he should not accept<br />\nit calmly, and what on earth he<br />\nshould want else.<br />\nAt the present time, there are<br />\nexactly two movements launched<br />\nby men in colleges which are sufficiently opposed to the trend of<br />\nevents to make even eddies in the<br />\nnational current.

Thus only shall we<br />\nmake a contribution to the intellectual agencies of this country,<br />\nand add a positive gain to American learning and education in the<br />\nsecond century of the Republic.<br />\nThe tenor of my remarks has<br />\nimplied perhaps more diversity of<br />\nopinion than really exists in respect to universities. The truth<br />\nis, most institutions are not.free<br />\nto build anew; they can only readjust. It has been playfully said<br />\nthat \"traditions and conditions\"<br />\nimpede their progress. But whatever may be the concrete difficulties on many abstract principles<br />\nthere is little need of controversy.<br />\nOur effort will be to accept that<br />\nwhich is determined \u2014 to avoid<br />\nthat which is obsolescent, to study<br />\nthat which is doubtful\u2014\"slowly<br />\nmaking haste.\"<br /><br />\nThere is no better way, The News-Letter deems, of commemorating the forty-first anniversary of the founding of the<br />\nUniversity\u2014an anniversary to which the removal to Homewood<br />\ngives epoch-making significance\u2014than by publishing the inaugural<br />\naddress of the University's first president.<br />\nThe part which Daniel Coit Gilman played in the conception<br />\nand development of the Johns Hopkins University is told, in better<br />\nwords than we can command, by his biographer, Fabian Franklin:<br />\n\"His was the co-ordinating mind and the decisive voice in the<br />\nshaping of the University's character and the determination of its<br />\npolicies. The policy of taking time to permit the beginnings to<br />\ndevelop,.of letting the University grow into its true self rather<br />\nthan forcing it into a rigid mold, appealed to him particularly; and<br />\nit is to the combination of the caution involved in this policy and<br />\nthe boldness of his fundamental purpose that the signal success<br />\nachieved by the University from the beginning must be ascribed.\"<br />\nWhat is reproduced on this page is only a part of that<br />\nfirst inaugural address; but it is sufficient to show clearly the<br />\nideals which the Johns Hopkins was created to fulfill\u2014the ideals<br />\nwhich must continue to guide the University in the future, as they<br />\nhave guided it in the past.<br />\nIs, then, anything settled in respect to university education?<br />\nMuch, very much. Can we draw<br />\na statement of what is agreed<br />\nupon? At any rate we can try.<br />\nThe schedule will include twelve<br />\npoints on which there seems to be<br />\na general agreement.<br />\n1. All sciences are worthy of<br />\npromotion; or in other words, it<br />\nis useless to dispute whether literature or science should receive<br />\nmost attention, or whether there<br />\nis any essential difference between<br />\nthe old and the new education.<br />\n2. Religion has nothing to fear<br />\nfrom science, and science need not<br />\nbe afraid of religion. Religion<br />\nclaims to interpret the word of<br />\nGod, and science reveals the laws<br />\nof God. The ' interpreters may<br /><br />\nblunder, but truths are immutable, eternal and never in conflict.<br />\n3. Remote utility is quite as<br />\nworthy to be thought of as immediate advantage. Those ventures are not always most sagacious that expect a return on the<br />\nmorrow. It sometimes pays to<br />\nsend our argosies across the seas;<br />\nto make investments with an eye<br />\nto slow but sure returns. So is it<br />\nalways in the promotion of science.<br />\n4. As it is impossible for any<br />\nuniversity to encourage with<br />\nequal freedom all branches of<br />\nlearning, a selection must be made<br />\nby enlightened governors, and<br />\nthat selection must depend on the<br />\nrequirements and deficiencies of a<br />\ngiven people, in a given period.<br /><br />\nDANIEL COIT GILMAN<br /><br />\nThere is no absolute standard of<br />\npreference. What is more important at one time or in one place<br />\nmay be less needed elsewhere and<br />\notherwise.<br />\n5. Individual students cannot<br />\npursue all branches of learning,<br />\nand must be allowed to select,<br />\nunder the guidance of those who<br />\nare appointed to counsel them.<br />\nNor can able professors be governed by routine. Teachers and<br />\npupils must be allowed great freedom in their method of work.<br />\nRecitations, lectures, examinations, laboratories, libraries, field<br />\nexercises, travels, \u2022are all legitimate means of culture.<br />\n6. The best scholars will almost<br />\ninvariably be those who make special attainments on the foundation of a broad and liberal culture.<br />\n7. The best teachers are usually<br />\nthose who are free, competent,<br />\nand willing to make original researches in the library and the<br />\nlaboratory.<br />\n8. The best investigators are<br />\nusually those who have also the<br />\nresponsibilities of instruction,<br />\ngaining thus the incitement of<br />\ncolleagues, the encouragement of<br />\npupils, the observation of the public.<br />\n9. Universities should bestow<br />\ntheir honors with a sparing hand;<br />\ntheir benefits most freely.<br />\n10. A university cannot be created in a day; it is a slow growth.<br />\nThe University of Berlin has been<br />\nquoted as a proof of the contrary.<br />\nThat was indeed a quick success,<br />\nbut in an old, compact country,<br />\ncrowded with learned men eager<br />\nto assemble at the Prussian court.<br />\nIt was a change of base rather<br />\nthan a sudden development.<br />\n11. The object of the university<br />\nis to develop character\u2014to make<br />\nmen.

Aside from the lack of<br />\ntact, to say the least, with which<br />\nthe new ruling was announced<br />\n(it is, as it stands, clearly ex post<br />\nfacto; a method now in disrepute<br />\namong more progressive legislators), its spirit is unworthy of a<br />\nuniversity. The members of the<br />\nfaculty had, no doubt, their own<br />\ngood reasons for promulgating<br />\ntheir edict; but could not the<br />\n\"cutting\" problem have been<br />\ndealt with in a less drastic manner? Unless I am misinformed,<br />\nit is the custom at most universities to allow a certain number of<br />\nunexcused absences from each<br />\nclass. This number is not necessarily large; nor is it probable<br />\nthat a student will lose any very<br />\nvital part of a course by absenting himself from it three or four<br />\ndays during the year.<br />\nIt is hard to see why some rule<br />\nmore of this nature can not be<br />\nadopted at Hopkins. Excessive<br />\n\"cutting\" is certainly an evil, and<br />\nthere were doubtless some few<br />\nstudents who abused the old tacit<br />\nunderstanding that two or three<br />\nunexcused absences each term<br />\nwould not seriously affect the<br />\nstudent's term mark; but is the<br />\nwhole student body to be made to<br />\nsuffer for these few?<br />\nThe whole question, moreover,<br />\nresolves itself, not into one of<br />\npower, but one of tact. The undoybted right of the faculty to<br />\ngovern in its own way can not be<br />\nquestioned. The faculty can do<br />\nanything \u2014 it has full power to<br />\n\"fire\" the whole undergraduate<br />\nbody it it sees fit. But the point<br />\nis, can it afford to antagonize the<br />\nundergraduates? Most of the Seniors would probably prefer to remain at the University, even under unpleasant conditions, since<br />\nonly about three more months remain for them here. But it is<br />\nquite conceivable that underclassmen, resenting the needless<br />\nembarrassment of explaining to<br /><br />\nMurad advertising understates<br />\nrather than exaggerates.<br />\nNOW,USTEN!<br />\nThe principal difference between Murad and<br />\nmost 25 Cent cigarettes<br />\nis Quality \u2014 in favor of<br />\nMurad.<br /><br />\nREMEMBER\u2014<br />\n'Turkish tobacco is<br />\nthe world's most<br />\nfamous tobacco for<br />\ncigarettes.<br /><br />\nPresents Another Objection.<br /><br />\nNEws-Lwrrzs:<br />\nSir\u2014The ear of the faculty<br />\nshould not be deaf to the widespread spirit of protest which<br />\nhas been occasioned by the announcement of the new regulations regarding absences from<br />\nclasses, especially since the remarks of protest come from the<br />\nstudent body as a whole.<br />\nIt is the opinion of most broadminded colleges and universities<br />\nthat when a man is old enough to<br />\nenter the doors of these institutions he should also be old enough<br />\nTo the Editor of THE<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, FEBRUARY 26, 1917.<br />\nto have a certain responsibility<br />\nin matters of personal conduct.<br />\n\u2022 It is perfectly conceivable that<br />\nmost students who are in our own<br />\nUniversity have sense enough to<br />\nknow whether they can \"cut\" a<br />\nclass without falling back in<br />\ntheir work,,even though their excuse might not seem an excuse<br />\nin the eyes. of another person.<br />\nAnd I believe that most persons<br />\nwill agree that the average student can have two or three of<br />\nthese unexcused tuts during a<br />\nterm without affecting his work<br />\nin the least.<br />\nA self-supporting student naturally has outFide interests<br />\nwhich may keep him away from<br />\na class occasionally, and it will<br />\nbe extremely distasteful, I am<br />\nsure, for him to have to appear<br />\nbefore a committee of the faculty<br />\nand explain the \"ins and outs\"<br />\nof his entirely personal matters<br />\nin order to save his mark from<br />\nbeing unjustly lowered at the end<br />\nof the term.

The editor's request was<br />\ntimely, as everything possible is<br />\nbeing done to turn it into a kindergarten.<br />\nA short time ago we were men,<br />\ncapable of taking care of ourselves.

This should not<br />\nhold in this case. I would venture<br />\nto say that there are not more than<br />\ntwenty men out of the three hundred that take courses here who<br />\nhabitually \"cut\" or come late to<br />\nclasses.
