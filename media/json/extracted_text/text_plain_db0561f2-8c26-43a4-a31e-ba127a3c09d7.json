Even in his<br />\nemotional outbursts, Strang never upstages her. They complement each other<br />\nvery well.<br />\nAs Alan's father, Adam Stern draws<br />\nboth the interest and the compassion of<br />\nthe audience. He shows that even a minor<br />\ncharacter is a complex personality in<br />\nShaffer's plays. Stern's speeches and<br />\nmanner reveal a studied insight into the<br />\npart and the play. An equally good<br />\nperformance is turned in by Joanna<br />\nSchwartz, who plays his wife. Elizabeth<br />\n<br />\nSN<br />\n<br />\nMontgomery plays Hesther as Dysart's<br />\ncompassionate friend, who, while she can<br />\nsympathize with his problems, can never<br />\nquite understand them.<br />\nThere are three parts for horses in<br />\nEquus. They are played by men, not<br />\ndressed in costumes but wearing wiresculpted horses' heads and seven-inch<br />\nwooden clogs. Through their movements<br />\nand skillful mime they convey the illusion<br />\nof being horses. As Alan's chosen horse<br />\nNugget and the horseman on the beach,<br />\nScott Paul is everything the role demands.<br />\nThe other horses, played by Peter Hodges<br />\nand Todd Rose, are equally adept at their<br />\nroles. As the nurse, Suzanne Sanders is<br />\nconvincing as well.<br />\nThe production is not only well<br />\nacted but well staged. Scene flows<br />\nsmoothly into scene.

The lighting eases these<br />\ntransitions and helps add to the effectiveness of the scenes between Alan and the<br />\nhorse.<br />\nThe major strength of this production of Equus is that it leaves the audience with several powerful impressions<br />\ncaught up in certain scenes. Jill and Alan<br />\nface each other in the stable; Alan cries<br />\n\"Ek!

Barbara Harris, as Ellie Tynan,<br />\ngives a beautifully human portrait of a<br />\n,troubled wife. She stands her ground at<br />\nthe right times, such as refusing to bow to<br />\nTynan's aides after revealing a miscarriage<br />\nand five ears of anal sis in a ma azine<br />\n<br />\ninterview, but never plays Ma Joad, which<br />\nwould be an easy but unconvincing part.<br />\nJoe is clearly the center of this family,<br />\nwhere she serves as a major sustaining<br />\nbuoy throughout. Meryl Streep brings her<br />\nrole an eminent sense of understanding,<br />\nemploying a combination of ebullience<br />\nand jadedness that could serve as a<br />\nworking definition for class. She soars,<br />\nliterally at one point, and we never<br />\nwonder why Alda is infatuated with her.<br />\nThe Seduction of Joe Tynan is<br />\nnot a lot of things. It isn't very good<br />\npolitical commentary. It isn't a statement<br />\nabout what values we should cherish.

The<br />\nBaltimore Orioles reside about<br />\neight blocks down 33rd Street at<br />\nMemorial Stadium.<br />\nThe \"Birds of Baltimore,\"<br />\nto quote a favorite phrase of<br />\nHoward Cosell, have been leading the Anierican League East<br />\nsince May 18. During this time,<br />\nthe O's have also managed to<br />\ncompile the best record in all of<br />\nMajor League Baseball: 90-46<br />\nwith less than one month of<br />\nregular season play to go.<br />\nA person from outside<br />\nMaryland probably knows very<br />\nlittle about the Orioles. They<br />\nhave no players like Reggie<br />\nJackson to gain them national<br />\nnotoriety, and they have not<br />\nparticipated in the high-stakes<br />\nfree agent bidding of recent<br />\n<br />\nyears.<br />\nInstead, the Orioles rely on<br />\nthe competent utilization of a<br />\nwell-developed farm system, the<br />\nmost consistently superlative<br />\npitching staff in baseball, and a<br />\nroster comprised of composed,<br />\ndependable athletes.<br />\nThe leaders of the O's,<br />\nalthough not nationally publicized, are players like Ken<br />\nSingleton, Eddie Murray and<br />\npitcher Mike Flanagan. Singleton<br />\nleads the team in home runs<br />\nwith 32, has over 100 RBI's thus<br />\nfar this season, and, although<br />\nnot known for his speed, plays a<br />\nsolid defensive right field.<br />\nEddie Murray is one of 15<br />\nplayers on the 25-man roster<br />\nwho came to the Orioles through<br />\nthe farm system. Eddie was<br />\nBBWAA (Baseball Writers Association of America) Rookie of<br />\nthe Year in 1977 and was Oriole<br />\n<br />\nPlayer of the Year last campaign.<br />\nThis season the team continues<br />\nto rely on Eddie to spark lateinning and often game-winning<br />\nrallies.<br />\nFlanagan, who along with<br />\nSingleton was named to the<br />\nAll-Star team this year, recently<br />\nbecame this year's first 20-game<br />\nwinner.<br />\nThe Orioles are also blessed<br />\nwith Earl Weaver, easily the<br />\nmost publicized and controversial member of the Oriole team.<br />\nThis season Earl won his 1000th<br />\ngame as a major league manager<br />\nand was recognized by Time<br />\nmagazine as a strategic genius.<br />\nEarl is notorious for his<br />\nuneasy relationships with umpires. He has been thrown out of<br />\nseven games this season alone,<br />\nand drew a 3-day suspension<br />\nfrom American League president<br />\nLee MacPhail after questioning<br />\n<br />\nan umpire's integrity. The appearance of an angered Earl<br />\nWeaver storming from the dugout never fails to bring the<br />\ncrowd at Memorial Stadium to<br />\nits feet.<br />\nDuring the course of a<br />\ngame, two \"mascots\" also bring<br />\nfans to their feet. The first<br />\nmascot is unofficial. Wild Bill<br />\nHagey is a local fan who, bedecked with a white cowboy hat<br />\nand Orioles T-shirt, leads cheers<br />\nfrom the upper deck of Section<br />\n34. He spells out 0-R-1-0-L-E-S<br />\nwith voice and body movements<br />\nand just about every fan in the<br />\nstadium cheers along with him.<br />\nWild Bill has gotten so<br />\npopular that not only is his<br />\nsection always the most crowded<br />\nin the stadium, but he has also<br />\nappeared in car and clothing<br />\nadvertisements and in a recent<br />\nsegment of a local quiz show.<br />\n<br />\nThe other mascot of the<br />\nOrioles was literally hatched<br />\nfrom an eight-foot egg on the<br />\nopening day of this season. He is<br />\nknown simply as \"The Bird\" and<br />\nis in fact a 6-foot Oriole who,<br />\namong other antics, leads fans in<br />\nfoot-stompin' and hand-clappin'<br />\nto the tune of\"Thank God I'm a<br />\nCountry Boy,\" during the traditional seventh-inning stretch.<br />\nThe Orioles have only eight<br />\nremaining home games (Boston:<br />\nSeptember 14, 15 and 16;<br />\nCleveland, September 21,22 and<br />\n23 and Detroit, September 25<br />\nand 26).

An equally good<br />\nperformance is turned in by Joanna<br />\nSchwartz, who plays his wife.
