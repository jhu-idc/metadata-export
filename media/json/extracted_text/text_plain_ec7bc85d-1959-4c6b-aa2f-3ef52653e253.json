Her basic theme was<br />\n\"the cultural acceptance of the<br />\nthreat of the use of force by men<br />\nagainst women is a conscious<br />\ninstrument by which men keep<br />\nwomen in fear.\"<br />\nShe compared the<br />\nphenomenon of rape to that of<br />\nthe lynching of blacks in the<br />\nSouth. Rapists, to Brownmiller,<br />\nare the front-line guerrillas in the<br />\nbattle by men to keep women in<br />\nan inferior position.<br />\nBrownmiller traced the history<br />\nof rape, pointing out that it<br />\noccurs in no other animals except<br />\nhumans. She noted that rape was<br />\nnot considered a crime in<br />\nantiquity, and that in the Bible it<br />\nwas even encouraged under<br />\ncertain circumstances.<br />\nRape was treated as theft, and<br />\nvirgin women were considered<br />\n<br />\ngoods, until the thirteenth<br />\ncentury<br />\n, according to<br />\nBrownmiller. Men who raped<br />\nwere thus able, and indeed were<br />\nobliged, to redeem themselves by<br />\nreimbursing the victim's family<br />\nand marrying the victim.<br />\nAfter a time, lowborn knights<br />\nbegan to exploit these rules by<br />\nstealing noble women for wives,<br />\nso Edward I of England<br />\nintroduced the first modern<br />\ncriminal laws about rape,<br />\nincluding the concept of<br />\nstatutory rape.<br />\nBrownmiller derided several<br />\nFreudian notions concerning rape<br />\nwhich have arisen during the<br />\ntwentieth century. The ideas that<br />\nwomen fantasize about rape and<br />\nthat they are inherently<br />\nmasochistic, while untrue, have<br />\nbeen \"absolutely accepted\" by<br />\nlawmakers, she stated.<br />\nShe also denounced the<br />\n\"glorification\" of rape which has<br />\nmade \"cultural heroes\" of Jack<br />\nthe Ripper, the Boston Strangler,<br />\nand Eldridge Cleaver. \"In the last<br />\nfew years, there has been a<br />\nmultitude of luscious rape scenes<br />\nin movies. If there had been<br />\nlynchings of blacks instead, it<br />\nabsolutely would not have been<br />\ntolerated.\"<br />\n<br />\nThus, Brownmiller had the<br />\ncourage to attack some of the<br />\nliberal ideas with which feminism<br />\nis often associated. She attacked<br />\nthe white liberals who<br />\nacknowledged Cleaver's<br />\n\"insurrectionary, revolutionary<br />\nright of rape.\" And her call for<br />\nan end to the institutions of<br />\nprostitution and pornography<br />\ncame at the expense of civil<br />\nlibertarians.<br />\nLabeling smut \"sheer<br />\nanti-female propaganda,\" she<br />\nvowed, \"I'm not afraid to use the<br />\nword censorship. I'm ready to<br />\nattack all of these civil<br />\nlibertarians.\" Even more<br />\nimperative is the end of<br />\nprostitution. she maintained. \"If<br />\nmen grow up thinking that sex is<br />\na service that can be purchased,<br />\nthen they will reason that<br />\nwhatever can be bought can also<br />\nbe taken.\" .<br />\nMichael J.

He was apt to<br />\nbe spotted at any hour of the<br />\nday, on any day of the .week,<br />\noften with his hair uncombed, his<br />\nface unshaven, his clothes<br />\nwrinkled and dirty, and his arm<br />\nwrapped in a soiled brown sling.<br />\nSeven years ago, this man of<br />\nbizarre aspect became chief<br />\nengineer of radio station WJHU.<br />\nSince then, he has become<br />\nknown as one of the strangest<br />\nfigures ever associated with the<br />\nUniversity. Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall has called Gross \"a<br />\nmystifying enigma.\"<br />\nThis spring, newcomers to<br />\nWJHU have apparently succeeded<br />\nin deposing Gross. Newcomers,<br />\nthat is, only in relation to Gross,<br />\nWho has been an institution at<br />\nthe station. These students have<br />\nPainted a picture of him as a<br />\ndomineering, power-loving man<br />\nwho monopolized the operation<br />\nof the station.<br />\nA second, and completely<br />\ncontrasting picture comes from<br />\nthe recent faculty advisor of the<br />\nstation , Dr. J.M. Minkowski.<br />\nMinkowski believes that Gross<br />\nwas a dedicated, tireless worker<br />\nwho built WJHU into a first-class<br />\nOperation. Since Gross dropped<br />\ncompletely out of sight two<br />\nmonths ago, Minkowski is the<br />\nonly man on campus who can<br />\nreply to Gross's detractors.<br />\nHere are some of the mysteries<br />\nconcerning Gross, and<br />\nMinkowski's statements with<br />\nregard to them.<br />\n--What was Gross's status in<br />\nthe Hopkins community? Was he<br />\npaid to be chief engineer of<br />\nWJHU? If not, where did he earn<br />\nhis livelihood?<br />\nOne rumor which was<br />\ncirculated freely among Gross's<br />\nformer colleagues at WJHU is<br />\nthat Gross repaired electrical<br />\nequipment, and that he is<br />\ncurrently being sued by one of<br />\nhis former clients, which is why<br />\nhe is now incommunicado. Gross<br />\nalso left a considerable number<br />\nof miscellaneous auto parts in the<br />\ncontrol room when he dropped<br />\nout of sight.<br />\n<br />\nMinkowski: 'Bill Gross was an<br />\nundergraduate in the Electrical<br />\nEngineering department at<br />\nHopkins, but he left without<br />\ngraduating. He returned seven<br />\nyears ago to become chief<br />\nengineer of WJHU. At the time,<br />\nhe enrolled in several courses<br />\nhere, and there was no<br />\nrequirement in the WJHU<br />\nconstitution that the officials of<br />\nthe station be undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\n'The radio station was very<br />\nsmall at that time. It had<br />\nbroadcast only 6 hours daily.<br />\nUnder Bill, it operated for as long<br />\nas there were people to run it,<br />\nsometimes 24 hours daily. Bill<br />\nput in very long hours, and he<br />\nwas not paid at all. No one<br />\ncould have been hired to do the<br />\njob that Bill did....<br />\n'Bill's family is not exactly<br />\ndestitute. Aside from that, I<br />\ndon't know where he got money<br />\nfrom.'<br />\n--WJHU operates under a large<br />\nhandicap as an unlicensed AM<br />\nstation. Eight attempts have been<br />\nmade to convert the station to<br />\nFM, but none have ever been<br />\nsuccessful. It has been asserted<br />\nthat Gross sabotaged efforts to<br />\nmake the change, in order to<br />\navoid losing his commanding<br />\nposition within WJHU. Similarly,<br />\nstudents have argued that he<br />\nwithheld technical information<br />\nwhich would have enabled<br />\nstudents to run the station<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nSaid Minkowski: 'The<br />\nattempts to convert to FM failed<br />\nfor financial reasons. It is a long<br />\nprocess just to apply to the FCC,<br />\nand the FCC treats each<br />\napplication as a competitive bid.'<br />\nHe displayed an estimate for<br />\nconversion made in the 1960's<br />\nwhich put the cost at $75,000.<br />\nThe station has also received<br />\nletters from schools which have<br />\ninitiated FM broadcasting<br />\nennumerating their headaches,<br />\nfinancial and otherwise.<br />\n'Bill has an immense<br />\nknowledge of the technology of<br />\nsmall radio stations, even<br />\nprofessional ones,' continued<br />\nMinkowski. 'The equipment here<br />\nis old, and it takes quite an<br />\nability to run it. I think anyone<br />\nelse who tries to run the station<br />\n<br />\nwill have problems. Probably the<br />\nbest thing he could do would be<br />\nto contact Bill Gross.'<br />\n--What about Gross's health?<br />\nHe has been wearing a sling on<br />\nhis left arm for as long as anyone<br />\ncan remember: There have been<br />\nrumors that his condition has<br />\nrecently deteriorated, and that<br />\ndeath may even threaten him<br />\nsince he staunchly refuses to have<br />\nhis arm amputated.<br />\nAccording to Minkowski,<br />\n'Four or five years ago, an engine<br />\nfell on his arm. Since then, it has<br />\nbeen a chronic problem for Bill.<br />\nHe has osteomyelitis, an<br />\ninfection of the bone marrow,<br />\nwhich must be constantly<br />\nchntained.<br />\n'Bill refuses to have his arm<br />\namputated because he is a superb<br />\npianist.

Jud<br />\nFrench would like to have Gross<br />\nwork with him, but Gross refuses<br />\nto even communicate with the<br />\nstation management.<br />\nMinkowski claimed that, 'The<br />\nyoung people didn't like the<br />\ndiscipline Bill imposed, especially<br />\nthe tight control he exercised<br />\nover the record library.

In the same<br />\nspirit, then, I would appreciate it<br />\nif others on the Committee<br />\nwould not try to represent my<br />\nviews, especially when such<br />\nrepresentation becomes<br />\nmisrepresentation. The case in<br />\npoint is with regard to the<br />\nbudgeting of the News-Letter.<br />\nLet me be explicit in the<br />\nbeginning: I voted in favor of<br />\ngiving the News-Letter a zero<br />\nSAC budget figure for 1976-77.<br />\nMy reasons for doing so,<br />\nhowever, are somewhat different<br />\nfrom those of other members on<br />\nthe Committee, at least different<br />\nfrom what Ron Bialek has<br />\nexpressed those views to be.<br />\nI am sure that no one is<br />\nunaware that there have been<br />\nproblems this year with regard to<br />\nthe News-Letter. No one,<br />\nincluding the editors I'm sure, is<br />\ncompletely satisfied with the<br />\nNews-Letter. At the same time,<br />\nmost students would agree that a<br />\nstudent-run Hopkins newspaper<br />\nis desirable, perhaps even<br />\nnecessary. I see mainly three<br />\nproblems that have been voiced,<br />\neach of differing importance.<br />\nOne of these problems is not,<br />\nhowever, the question of salaries.<br />\nThat problem was dealt with and,<br />\nI thought, concluded last year. I<br />\nam fairly certain that particular<br />\nsalaries are necessary, and the<br />\nonly questionable area may be in<br />\nthe size of the salaries, and that<br />\nissue has not been raised in this<br />\nyear's budgeting.<br />\nWhat has been most frequently<br />\nvoiced as a problem concerns the<br />\ncontent and editorial policy of<br />\nthe paper. It has been suggested<br />\nthat not enough news about<br />\nJohns Hopkins, the Homewood<br />\ncampus in particular, has been<br />\nprinted. Coupled with this<br />\ncomplaint is that the News-Letter<br />\nhas failed to give adequate<br />\ncoverage to student government<br />\nand to student organizations in<br />\ngeneral. This complaint became<br />\nparticularly noticeable around<br />\nthe time of Student Council<br />\nelections when many students<br />\nfelt that they didn't know<br />\nenough about the candidates or<br />\nstudent government to make an<br />\nintelligent decision. The Friday<br />\nfeatures issue of the News-Letter<br />\nhas particularly (but . not<br />\nexclusively) come under attack,<br />\nmany urging that the material<br />\nprinted is rubbish (verbage,<br />\nuseless) or at least inappropriate.<br />\nRegardless of the merits of the<br />\narguments, the complaints have<br />\nbeen made and not by a few.<br />\nA second problem that has not<br />\nbeen so widely voiced, but which<br />\nis in my view equally important,<br />\nis that is has been alleged that the<br />\nstaff of the News-Letter has been<br />\nabused by its management, or at<br />\nthe very least that the working<br />\natmosphere at the Gatehouse has<br />\nbeen less than desirable.<br />\nImportantly, this is an item that<br />\nhas been raised from within the<br />\nNews-Letter, by both present and<br />\nformer staff members, both on<br />\nthe masthead and off of it. The<br />\nSAC Executive Committee spent<br />\nmuch of the Fall semester (to be<br />\nsure, probably too much of it)<br />\n<br />\ndealing with such a problem. The<br />\nNews-Letter freely admits that it<br />\nis having difficulty in obtaining<br />\nand holding on to sufficient<br />\nnumbers of staff members. In<br />\nfact, a member of the N-L<br />\nproduction team told me that the<br />\npaper may be forced to go to<br />\nonly one issue a week due to not<br />\nhaving enough people working on<br />\nit. The editors suggest that this is<br />\ndue to the amount of work and<br />\ndedication required. This may or<br />\nmay not be true, but the point is<br />\nthat there are complaints coming<br />\nfrom staff members to the<br />\ncontrary.<br />\nThe third problem is less<br />\nsignificant, but a problem just<br />\nthe same. Many campus<br />\norganizations claim that<br />\nNews-Letter ad rates for campus<br />\norganizations are too high, and<br />\nthat the service that they receive<br />\nis inadequate. This inadequacy of<br />\nservice includes complaints that<br />\nlayout is poor, that there are too<br />\nmany added costs, requirements<br />\nare too complicated, and that<br />\nworking with N-L people to get<br />\nan ad printed is anything but<br />\npleasant. Indeed, it is suggested<br />\nthat News-Letter ad service is<br />\ntypical of any organization that<br />\nhas a monopoly in its area; i.e. if<br />\nyou don't like the service, where<br />\nelse are you to go?<br />\nAll of these problems have<br />\nat one time or another, in some<br />\nform or another, come before the<br />\nSAC Executive Committee. The<br />\npowers and function of the SAC<br />\nare summed up as the promotion: and<br />\nregulation of student activities on<br />\nthe Homewood campus. I would<br />\nagree that, at least for the time<br />\nthat I'm aware of its activities,<br />\nthe SAC has done too little<br />\npromotion and possibly too<br />\nmuch regulation, but I think that<br />\nthis is more reflective of what the<br />\nChairman has steered toward the<br />\nCommission and its Executive<br />\nCommittee than it is of the<br />\npotential of the organization.<br />\nRegulation need not be the nasty<br />\nthing that it sounds like, and it<br />\nhas been my intention that it not<br />\nbe. If it has, I think that this was<br />\nmore the result of execution than<br />\nof a desired policy. In fact, only<br />\nfour organizations this past year<br />\nhave had to suffer any kind of<br />\nregulation, and in at least one of<br />\nthese instances I don't think that<br />\nyou will find any complaints(ask<br />\nthe people over at WJHU) other<br />\nthan that the Executive<br />\nCommittee was not involved<br />\nenough. The power of regulation<br />\nitself that the SAC possesses is<br />\nseeing<br />\ncircumscribed to<br />\nthat organizations operate<br />\nroughly within their budgets, and<br />\nensuring that organizations<br />\noperate according to how they<br />\nwere constitutionally chartered.<br />\nThe first role emanates from the<br />\nresponsibility that the SAC has<br />\nto member organizations in the<br />\njust distribution and use of<br />\nlimited student activities funds,<br />\nin ensuring that no organization<br />\nmisuses funds that could<br />\notherwise have been used by<br />\nanother SAC member group. The<br />\nsecond role comes from the<br />\nresponsibility that the SAC has<br />\nto the individual students making<br />\nup the membership of the SAC<br />\ngroups, in ensuring that<br />\nindividuals are treated fairly<br />\nwithin, and have access to, each<br />\n<br />\ngroup as outlined in its own<br />\nparticular constitution.<br />\nWhat all of this means to me is<br />\nthat it is incumbent upon the<br />\nSAC, and its Executive<br />\nCommittee, to at least give ear<br />\nwhen it receives complaints that<br />\nan organization is violating one<br />\nof the above and to take the<br />\nnecessary action if the complaint<br />\nis justified. As I have shown,<br />\nthere have been complaints in at<br />\nleast three areas with regard to<br />\nthe News-Letter, and it has been<br />\nthe duty of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee to deal with them.<br />\nUnfortunately, the SAC has<br />\nbeen asked too frequently to deal<br />\nwith complaints concerning the<br />\nNews-Letter. It has been dealing<br />\nwith these problems,some of them<br />\nfrequent problems, that<br />\nproduced the present budgetary<br />\nrecommendation by the SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee to the<br />\nbody of the whole SAC. Not at<br />\nall as a punitive measure, I see<br />\nthe decision as a long term<br />\nsolution that is beneficial for the<br />\nNews- Letter, student<br />\ngovernment, and the students<br />\nalike. My vote on the<br />\nNews-Letter appropriation was<br />\ntied to another vote in the<br />\n1976-77 SAC budget: the<br />\nallocation of funds for the<br />\ncreation of a second student<br />\npublication here at Homewood. I<br />\ncould not have voted one<br />\nwithout the other.<br />\nThe News-Letter is a weird<br />\ncreature among SAC groups for a<br />\nnumber of reasons. First of all,<br />\nthe SAC Exedutive Committee<br />\nhas singularly had difficulties in<br />\nthe carrying out of its<br />\nresponsibilities with regard to the<br />\nNews-Letter. Each time that the<br />\nCommittee has tried-to deal with<br />\nthe paper the N-L people have<br />\njumped up on the soap-box and<br />\ncried censorship. This is a<br />\nparticularly hard cry to combat,<br />\nwhether or not it is justified,<br />\nbecause of the sensitivity of most<br />\npeople to the issue. Even<br />\nsuggestions that the News-Letter<br />\npay more attention to the<br />\nHomewood campus and less to<br />\nCharles Village were met with<br />\ncries of violation of freedom of<br />\nthe press. The present<br />\ncontroversy serves as another<br />\nexample of this, even though<br />\nabsolutely no mention was made<br />\nabout editorial policy and format<br />\nin the budget notification sent to<br />\nthe News-Letter, and had such a<br />\nrecommendation been made in<br />\nthe Executive Committee I<br />\nwould have strongly fought it.<br />\nThe cries, though unjustified, are<br />\nrather understandable, for<br />\nbudgeting and appropriations is a<br />\nvery sensitive time for SAC<br />\ngroups. What is not sufficiently<br />\nunderstood is that a zero budget<br />\nappropriation (self-sufficient)<br />\nNews-Letter is probably the best<br />\nsituation for improved relations<br />\nbetween it and the SAC. The<br />\nNews-Letter no longer has to fear<br />\nSAC control through the power<br />\nof the purse-strings (the SAC's<br />\nmost potent, but rarely used,<br />\nweapon), and the SAC no longer<br />\nhas to suffer accusations of using<br />\nthis power for censorship each<br />\ntime that it touches on an issue<br />\nconcerning the paper.<br />\n<br />\nSee ABERNATHY,page 7/<br />\n<br />\n\fPhilosopher's incarnation<br />\n<br />\nphoto by Jennifer bishop<br />\n<br />\n'Eat your carrots, son.'<br />\nBy WES PARDUE<br />\nIt was a bright, sunny Friday.<br />\nThat alone was significant.<br />\nUsually, the weekdays were<br />\nbeautiful while each weekend<br />\npromised to be a deluge.

Steinberg<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI regret having to disturb your<br />\nstate of complacency and<br />\ncontentment, but to the best of<br />\n'fly understanding, Hopkins<br />\nstudents do not share your most<br />\nmodest esteem of you paper.<br />\n(Perhaps the papers all disappear<br />\nnow because you distribute them<br />\nmore widely, in more ridiculous<br />\nPlaces. For instance, there is<br />\nahvays a pile rotting in the lobby<br />\nof my non-University apartment<br />\nbuilding.) Unfortunately, I and<br />\nnlanyof my colleagues have come<br />\nto regard the paper as a waste of<br />\n<br />\nSAC money. If you want to<br />\nprint, expounding on any whim<br />\nof your fancy, fine, but manage<br />\non the financial support of all<br />\nyour fans.<br />\nWith regard to your editorial<br />\non the editorial page, it is<br />\nunfortunate that you have such a<br />\nnarrow understanding of the<br />\ncampus parking regulations and<br />\ntheir enforcement. Without<br />\nexplaining here, I can state, as<br />\nyour former representative on<br />\nthe Traffic committee, that the<br />\nUniversity community can be<br />\nthankful that few of its members<br />\nexhibit the remarkable degree of<br />\nselfish, insensitive disrespect for<br />\nthe regulations that some<br />\nNews-Letter members have.<br />\nPaul Kromberg<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThis last, perhaps ultimate,<br />\noutrage the executive committee<br />\nof the SAC has attempted to<br />\nperpetrate against our beloved<br />\nAlma Mater in committing media<br />\nhomicide constrains us to a<br />\ncourse of action no other<br />\nmisguided, inept, impotent<br />\nstudent government over 12<br />\ncollective years at JHU has<br />\nmanaged to do: we have<br />\novercome utmost condescension<br />\nand contempt of student politics<br />\nto bring this indictment.<br />\nJ'accuse.<br />\nWe unequivocally attest to the<br />\nqualitative character of the<br />\npresent News-Letter as being the<br />\nbest in our realm of experience at<br />\nHopkins. Some charge the<br />\nNews-Letter with being an<br />\ninchoate, News American styled<br />\nrag; we submit that these, and<br />\nother criticisms, are irrelevant to<br />\nthe central issue, the gravaman of<br />\nthis indictment. The SAC is<br />\nmerely functioning in the grand<br />\nold style of student politics:<br />\nexceedingly petty, self-indulgent<br />\nand above all, self-serving.<br />\nWe rest assured knowing all<br />\nenlightened parties are familiar<br />\nwith the rationale in maintaining<br />\n<br />\nne autonomy of the<br />\nNews-Letter. However, the SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee would be<br />\nwell served in taking to heart the<br />\nvenerable maxim\u2014In propria<br />\ncausa, nemo judex (No one<br />\nshould be the judge in his own<br />\ncase) As elected representatives,<br />\nthe SAC should be painfully<br />\naware of who the judges are in<br />\nthis case.<br />\nJohn Morrison '74<br />\nS. Karlton Kop '74<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBefore I start ranting and<br />\nraving, I'd better say this: I don't<br />\nknow any of the N-L staff by<br />\nsight let alone personally, and so<br />\nI have no reason to be biased for<br />\nor against them. All I know<br />\nabout the N-L is that I) It is now<br />\ngenerally better than it has been<br />\nat any time in the last three<br />\nyears; 2) It is by far the best<br />\nstudent newspaper in Maryland<br />\n(doubters take a Peek at the<br />\nLoyola Greyhound); 3) The<br />\nmoney that the SAC proposes to<br />\ndeny it, comes ultimately from<br />\nmy tuition, and by God if it<br />\ndoesn't get that money I'll<br />\nfucking know the reason why.<br />\nJesus Christ, can't those pussies<br />\nstand criticism!? The N-L has<br />\ndone more for this academic<br />\nhole-in-the-wall than all the<br />\nvarious council members,<br />\npresidents, treasurer,<br />\nrepresentatives, and other<br />\nassholes combined, and don't<br />\nyou forget it! Fuck you too!<br />\n(pause for deep -breath). . .Ah,<br />\nwell, it is a fact I have known<br />\nsince high school (where one of<br />\nour beloved leaders, who shall<br />\nremain nameless, was class<br />\npresident) that any student who<br />\nruns for a student office and<br />\nactually cares who wins is<br />\nautomatically and ipso facto an<br />\nasshole. SAC execs, April,<br />\nSheldon, et. al., if you're still<br />\nreading this, consider: it is not<br />\nonly the privilege but the duty of<br />\nthe press to give the government<br />\n<br />\nshit, and keep them humble. The<br />\nNews-Letter is doing a fine job,<br />\nand deserves both our continued<br />\neconomic support and our<br />\nthanks.<br />\nThomas Olson '77<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is true that this _year the<br />\nNews-Letter and I have differed<br />\nin opinion about practically<br />\neverything. I am aware of the<br />\ndegree of respect that the<br />\nNews-Letter staff assigns my<br />\ndecisions. But in this case I<br />\ncannot leave the News-Letter to<br />\nprint totally erroneous facts<br />\nabout me. The article on pg. 4 of<br />\nthe April 16 N-L that concerns<br />\nitself with my task force<br />\nselection of a band for the senior<br />\nclass party contains, in no<br />\nmanner, a word of truth. I was<br />\nnot interviewed for this<br />\ninformation, nor was Susan<br />\nWeiss, who did play an integral<br />\npart in the Band selection. I do<br />\nnot know the source of Russ<br />\nSmith's article, but it is an<br />\nunreliable one.<br />\nI have never, in any way, been<br />\nassociated with the Senior Class<br />\nGraduation Planning Committee;<br />\nthe Social Committee does not<br />\nwork in conjunction with this<br />\ncommittee. Neither the Social<br />\nCommittee nor myself personally<br />\nwas assigned the task of securing<br />\na band .for the graduation party.<br />\nmember<br />\nof<br />\nIn February, a<br />\nthe Committee called me up and<br />\nasked me to give ,my opinion of<br />\nseveral bands that they were<br />\nconsidering hiring for the Senior<br />\nClass Dance., I told the person<br />\nthat frankly Man's Theory was a<br />\ngood band but a bit expensive<br />\n(but I don't think the Student<br />\nCentennial Birthday Bash was an<br />\nexclusive audience, by any<br />\nmeans); that Fancy Colours was<br />\nalso a fine band although<br />\nexpensive but were more the<br />\n\"prom-type\" band that I felt the<br />\noccasion called for; that Ocean<br />\nRose was a fine band, not one<br />\n<br />\nthat was my particular favorite,<br />\nwere indisputably Hopkins<br />\naffiliated and were a more<br />\nreasonable price; and finally I<br />\nsaid that London Fogg, when<br />\nthey had played for the Council<br />\nlast fall, had not given a good<br />\nperformance, nor had they been<br />\nparticularly cooperative but the<br />\npossibility exists that they had<br />\nimproved. All of these statements<br />\nwere given as my personal<br />\nopinion which was solicited; I<br />\nwas never contacted again. I was<br />\nnot informed at the time that my<br />\nviews would be the deciding<br />\nfactor in the band selection.<br />\nAfter a little research into the<br />\nfinal outcome, I was told by<br />\nSusan Weiss that the Committee<br />\nlistened to all the bands<br />\nnominated, discussed pros and<br />\ncons of each arrangement and<br />\nthen voted, in the democratic<br />\nmanner, to have Fancy Colours.<br />\nAnd so, in that way, I have<br />\nbecome personally responsible<br />\nfor yet another disastrous social<br />\ndecision.<br />\nI realize the News-Letter feels<br />\nthat the free press is the only<br />\npress, as do I. I also happen to<br />\nfeel that the only press is the<br />\ncorrect press. I have often<br />\nthought the N-L prints very<br />\nselective news, but as long as this<br />\nnews is correct then they are<br />\nwithin their rights. However I<br />\nthink that this time they have<br />\ngone beyond the realm of good<br />\nor even adequate journalism and<br />\nare now in the business known as<br />\nthel yellow press. (The manner of<br />\npresentation is not even<br />\narticulate, but one that I found<br />\nto be on the order of verbal<br />\nabuse.) As much as I am opposed<br />\nto the recent SAC budget cut of<br />\nthe N-L funds, I see no reason to<br />\nfund, buy or read a paper that<br />\nchooses to establish a reputation<br />\nfor publishing illegitimate and<br />\nunsubstantiated material.<br />\nApril Moreno<br />\nClass of'76<br />\n<br />\n\fe 6/news-letter/april 20, 1976<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\no \u00b0bondnao nonononnnon=onauamloor]0[000propip=ofo.000100<br />\n<br />\nJHU Centennial Picnic<br />\nApril 24, 1976<br />\n<br />\nSENIOR CLASS<br />\nPARTY<br />\nFREE PIZZA<br />\nsilo BEER<br />\n<br />\nENTERTAINMENT,<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\n<br />\nFOOD & DRINK<br />\nCOST<br />\n$1.00 - homewood community<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nFriday, April 23<br />\n9:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\n$2.50 - others<br />\nsponsored by the student centennial<br />\ncommittee for the ENJOYMENT of the<br />\nhomewood community: STUDENTS,<br />\nFACULTY,EMPLOYEES and<br />\ntheir families<br />\nmembers of the SAGA meal plan may exchange<br />\nlunch at the dorms for a picnic ticket<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022.\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n\u2022.\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022:.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDorm Cafeteria<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n:<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n.\u2022..\u2022<br />\nseniors and their guests only<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\n<br />\nii<br />\niJ<br />\n<br />\ntickets on sale at the Union Desk<br />\nsign up for team sports in your department<br />\n,gMXENA,DLUAAWNDWDELICEADEMEAag(=lobo00<br />\nw..Le.\"-E.\"210Egii.0011311100 MD.\u2022MM0011E<br />\n<br />\n**************************************************<br />\n*<br />\n* CLASS OFFICERS FINAL ELECTION!

This<br />\nbrings us to another reason why<br />\nthe News- Letter is such a weird<br />\ncreature. Unlike most other<br />\nnewspapers enjoying freedom of<br />\nthe press in the United States,<br />\n<br />\nthe News-Letter is responsible to<br />\nno one, particularly to its<br />\nreaders. It earns money on ad<br />\nrevenue, part of which is<br />\nobtained because of a monopoly<br />\nof the campus market, and the<br />\nrest of its money is handed to it<br />\nin a yearly budget appropriation<br />\n(although this budget<br />\nappropriation averages only 12%<br />\nof their total budget). In this<br />\n<br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\npresents<br />\nTHE GOUCHER-HOPKINSCHORUSIN CONCERT<br />\nprogram:<br />\nSymphony of the Psalms - Stravinsky<br />\nFive Songs on Old Texts - Hindemith<br />\nperformed by the Madrigal Singers<br />\nGloria - Poulenc<br />\n<br />\nsituation, the only real way of<br />\nbringing pressure to bear upon<br />\nthe News-Letter over editorial or<br />\nother policy is through the<br />\norganization that funds it, the<br />\nSAC. But most people find this<br />\ndistasteful, including this<br />\nmember of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee. By no longer funding<br />\nthe paper, and creating a<br />\ncompeting paper, pressure on<br />\neditorial policy will now come<br />\nfrom the readers, who will<br />\ndemonstrate their opinions<br />\nthrough their reactions to the<br />\ntwo different publications.<br />\nThis competition at the same<br />\ntime will solve whatever other<br />\nproblems may exist. If the staff<br />\nin truth is being misused, then<br />\nthey will have another outlet for<br />\ntheir journalistic and related<br />\ntalents, and the management of<br />\nthe News-Letter will be forced to<br />\nchange its policies or lose its<br />\n<br />\nstaff. The same would hold true<br />\nto criticisms over ad service if<br />\nindeed a problem there does<br />\nexist. One further advantage that<br />\nbecomes apparent is that as the<br />\nNews-Letter has been becoming<br />\nincreasingly a political actor on<br />\nthe campus the potential for<br />\nmisuse of its monopoly on press<br />\ndistribution of information<br />\nbecomes greater. Indeed,<br />\naccusations of such misuse have<br />\nalready been heard. The creation<br />\nof competitive papers would<br />\neliminate the grounds for<br />\ncomplaint.<br />\nThere is one catch to this, a<br />\nbig one maybe. The<br />\nestablishment of a second<br />\nnewspaper, one that is not just a<br />\nrag for student government, will<br />\nbe no easy task. It will involve<br />\nthe work and enthusiasm of a<br />\ngood number of students. The<br />\nneed is there, the benefits are<br />\n<br />\ngreat, and I feel that there also<br />\nexists the desire. President-elect<br />\nSteve Ponchak promised that he<br />\nwill do what he can (and that<br />\nshould be considerable) to get a<br />\nnew paper started. Let's hold him<br />\nto his word. The SAC is giving<br />\nhim the opportunity.<br />\nI'll be the first one to admit<br />\nthat this a gamble, but I think<br />\nthat the potential<br />\ndividends are worth it.<br />\nI also feel that the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is willing to support<br />\nsuch a move, without which<br />\nsupport it will be impossible to<br />\nimplement. I may be wrong, and<br />\nnot for the first time. If I am,<br />\nthen let me know.

The first game<br />\nwas totally dominated by the<br />\nhome team while the second<br />\ncontest saw a complete reversal<br />\n.of roles.<br />\n<br />\nteam in the country.\"<br />\nJust as he had done in the first<br />\nhalf Cornell's Brian Lasda<br />\ncontrolled the opening face-off<br />\nof the second half and then<br />\nDybus opened the second half<br />\nscoring just as he'd done in the<br />\nfirst, by tallying with a minute<br />\ngone, upping the Big Red's lead<br />\nto 10-6. Not only was this the<br />\nlargest lead of the game but it<br />\nwas the biggest deficit by which<br />\nthe Blue Jays had fallen behind<br />\nall season; a record which proved<br />\nshort-lived.<br />\nNearly eleven minutes passed<br />\nbefore the next score but during<br />\nthat time the tone of the contest<br />\nunderwent an unaccountably<br />\nradical change.<br />\nOne would have thought that<br />\nit was Cornell who was the home<br />\nteam and spirited underdog<br />\nrather than vice versa. The Big<br />\nRed certainly played the part<br />\nperfectly. They outhustled and<br />\noutmuscled the Blue Jays,<br />\nbeating (literally) to every key<br />\nground ball.\\ Their defense<br />\nexhibited the aggressive<br />\ndouble teaming tactics which<br />\nHopkins had expected but<br />\nunaccountably didn't seem<br />\nprepared to handle.<br />\nThe Jays became unglued. The<br />\nfew times that they could get the<br />\nball away from the New Yorkers<br />\nthe hosts came down the field<br />\nand, showing no organization at<br />\nall, either went one-on-one and<br />\nti lost the ball on a double-team, or<br />\ncame down and fired a wild shot<br />\nor errant pass.<br />\n-el Meanwhile the Hopkins<br />\ndefense was doing its part.<br />\nForced to contend with the<br />\nobvious obstacle of having the<br />\nball down in their end for<br />\npractically the entire second half,<br />\ndefensemen Jim Moorhead (who<br />\nplayed McEneaney admirably<br />\nconsidering his heavily taped leg<br />\ndue to pulled ligaments),<br />\nfreshman Mike Sheedy, Chad<br />\nMarrison, Mike Connor, and<br />\ngoalie Kevin Mahon held the<br />\ncountry's most potent attack<br />\nunit to one goal in the first<br />\nthirteen minutes of the third<br />\nquarter despite the ineffectual<br />\nplay of their mates.<br />\nIn fact it was the defense<br />\nwhich looked as if it would<br />\nsupply the spark to ignite the<br />\nHopkins attack which looked as<br />\n<br />\nif it had gone into early<br />\nhibernation. Sheedy after<br />\ncarrying the ball agross midfield<br />\non a clear, took a feed from<br />\nat tackman Richie Hirsch and<br />\nfired it past Cornell goalie Dan<br />\nMackesey for the Jays' first tally<br />\nof the second half. That cut the<br />\nBig Red's lead to 10-7 and<br />\ninstilled optimism in the hearts<br />\nof Homewood fans and<br />\nseemingly, new-found confidence<br />\nin the Homewood stickmen.<br />\nHowever that was not to be<br />\nthe case. Sheedy's goal was just a<br />\nmomentary pause in the course<br />\nof the inevitable result.<br />\nThe lifeless lack-luster way the<br />\nBlue Jays played after<br />\nintermission had predestined<br />\nthem for humiliating defeat.<br />\nLittle did anyone know at the<br />\ntime that the freshman<br />\ndefenseman s goal was to be the<br />\nonly Hopkins score of the second<br />\nhalf, an incredible statistic<br />\npractically unheard of in<br />\nHopkins lacrosse annals.<br />\nCornell continued right where<br />\nthey had left off before Sheedy<br />\nhad so rudely interrupted them.<br />\nThey physically intimidated the<br />\nBlue Jays in the Jays backyard.<br />\nCoach Richie Moran's troops<br />\n<br />\nbaffled the Jays' vain attempts to<br />\nride them, clearing the ball with<br />\nrelative ease.<br />\nEn route to outscoring<br />\nHopkins 6-1 in the disastrous<br />\nsecond half, Cornell notched the<br />\nlast two scores of the thrid<br />\nquarter on goals by Billy Marino<br />\nfrom Henrickson and<br />\nMcEneaney unassisted to give<br />\nthem a 12-7 lead.<br />\nThe futile play of the Hopkins<br />\nten culminated in the fourth<br />\nquarter. The Blue Jays didn't get<br />\nthe ball across midfield for nearly<br />\nfive 6,11 minutes in a display of<br />\nhapless frustration which<br />\nold time fans of Homewood<br />\nlacrosse called \"the worst<br />\nlacrosse ever played by a Hopkins<br />\nteam on Homewood Field.\"<br />\nCoach Ciccarone's charges are<br />\ncertainly in one enviable position<br />\nbeing that they have it within<br />\ntheir grasp to do something<br />\nabout their situation rather than<br />\nhaving to rely on others to<br />\nelevate their status for them.<br />\nUpcoming games with<br />\nonce beaten Brown, and<br />\nunbeaten Navy and Maryland<br />\ncould certainly change the course<br />\nof the season.

Her basic theme was<br />\n\"the cultural acceptance of the<br />\nthreat of the use of force by men<br />\nagainst women is a conscious<br />\ninstrument by which men keep<br />\nwomen in fear.\"<br />\nShe compared the<br />\nphenomenon of rape to that of<br />\nthe lynching of blacks in the<br />\nSouth. Rapists, to Brownmiller,<br />\nare the front-line guerrillas in the<br />\nbattle by men to keep women in<br />\nan inferior position.<br />\nBrownmiller traced the history<br />\nof rape, pointing out that it<br />\noccurs in no other animals except<br />\nhumans. She noted that rape was<br />\nnot considered a crime in<br />\nantiquity, and that in the Bible it<br />\nwas even encouraged under<br />\ncertain circumstances.<br />\nRape was treated as theft, and<br />\nvirgin women were considered<br /><br />\ngoods, until the thirteenth<br />\ncentury<br />\n, according to<br />\nBrownmiller. Men who raped<br />\nwere thus able, and indeed were<br />\nobliged, to redeem themselves by<br />\nreimbursing the victim's family<br />\nand marrying the victim.<br />\nAfter a time, lowborn knights<br />\nbegan to exploit these rules by<br />\nstealing noble women for wives,<br />\nso Edward I of England<br />\nintroduced the first modern<br />\ncriminal laws about rape,<br />\nincluding the concept of<br />\nstatutory rape.<br />\nBrownmiller derided several<br />\nFreudian notions concerning rape<br />\nwhich have arisen during the<br />\ntwentieth century. The ideas that<br />\nwomen fantasize about rape and<br />\nthat they are inherently<br />\nmasochistic, while untrue, have<br />\nbeen \"absolutely accepted\" by<br />\nlawmakers, she stated.<br />\nShe also denounced the<br />\n\"glorification\" of rape which has<br />\nmade \"cultural heroes\" of Jack<br />\nthe Ripper, the Boston Strangler,<br />\nand Eldridge Cleaver. \"In the last<br />\nfew years, there has been a<br />\nmultitude of luscious rape scenes<br />\nin movies. If there had been<br />\nlynchings of blacks instead, it<br />\nabsolutely would not have been<br />\ntolerated.\"<br /><br />\nThus, Brownmiller had the<br />\ncourage to attack some of the<br />\nliberal ideas with which feminism<br />\nis often associated. She attacked<br />\nthe white liberals who<br />\nacknowledged Cleaver's<br />\n\"insurrectionary, revolutionary<br />\nright of rape.\" And her call for<br />\nan end to the institutions of<br />\nprostitution and pornography<br />\ncame at the expense of civil<br />\nlibertarians.<br />\nLabeling smut \"sheer<br />\nanti-female propaganda,\" she<br />\nvowed, \"I'm not afraid to use the<br />\nword censorship. I'm ready to<br />\nattack all of these civil<br />\nlibertarians.\" Even more<br />\nimperative is the end of<br />\nprostitution. she maintained. \"If<br />\nmen grow up thinking that sex is<br />\na service that can be purchased,<br />\nthen they will reason that<br />\nwhatever can be bought can also<br />\nbe taken.\" .<br />\nMichael J.

He was apt to<br />\nbe spotted at any hour of the<br />\nday, on any day of the .week,<br />\noften with his hair uncombed, his<br />\nface unshaven, his clothes<br />\nwrinkled and dirty, and his arm<br />\nwrapped in a soiled brown sling.<br />\nSeven years ago, this man of<br />\nbizarre aspect became chief<br />\nengineer of radio station WJHU.<br />\nSince then, he has become<br />\nknown as one of the strangest<br />\nfigures ever associated with the<br />\nUniversity. Dean of Students<br />\nJakie Hall has called Gross \"a<br />\nmystifying enigma.\"<br />\nThis spring, newcomers to<br />\nWJHU have apparently succeeded<br />\nin deposing Gross. Newcomers,<br />\nthat is, only in relation to Gross,<br />\nWho has been an institution at<br />\nthe station. These students have<br />\nPainted a picture of him as a<br />\ndomineering, power-loving man<br />\nwho monopolized the operation<br />\nof the station.<br />\nA second, and completely<br />\ncontrasting picture comes from<br />\nthe recent faculty advisor of the<br />\nstation , Dr. J.M. Minkowski.<br />\nMinkowski believes that Gross<br />\nwas a dedicated, tireless worker<br />\nwho built WJHU into a first-class<br />\nOperation. Since Gross dropped<br />\ncompletely out of sight two<br />\nmonths ago, Minkowski is the<br />\nonly man on campus who can<br />\nreply to Gross's detractors.<br />\nHere are some of the mysteries<br />\nconcerning Gross, and<br />\nMinkowski's statements with<br />\nregard to them.<br />\n--What was Gross's status in<br />\nthe Hopkins community? Was he<br />\npaid to be chief engineer of<br />\nWJHU? If not, where did he earn<br />\nhis livelihood?<br />\nOne rumor which was<br />\ncirculated freely among Gross's<br />\nformer colleagues at WJHU is<br />\nthat Gross repaired electrical<br />\nequipment, and that he is<br />\ncurrently being sued by one of<br />\nhis former clients, which is why<br />\nhe is now incommunicado. Gross<br />\nalso left a considerable number<br />\nof miscellaneous auto parts in the<br />\ncontrol room when he dropped<br />\nout of sight.<br /><br />\nMinkowski: 'Bill Gross was an<br />\nundergraduate in the Electrical<br />\nEngineering department at<br />\nHopkins, but he left without<br />\ngraduating. He returned seven<br />\nyears ago to become chief<br />\nengineer of WJHU. At the time,<br />\nhe enrolled in several courses<br />\nhere, and there was no<br />\nrequirement in the WJHU<br />\nconstitution that the officials of<br />\nthe station be undergraduate<br />\nstudents.<br />\n'The radio station was very<br />\nsmall at that time. It had<br />\nbroadcast only 6 hours daily.<br />\nUnder Bill, it operated for as long<br />\nas there were people to run it,<br />\nsometimes 24 hours daily. Bill<br />\nput in very long hours, and he<br />\nwas not paid at all. No one<br />\ncould have been hired to do the<br />\njob that Bill did....<br />\n'Bill's family is not exactly<br />\ndestitute. Aside from that, I<br />\ndon't know where he got money<br />\nfrom.'<br />\n--WJHU operates under a large<br />\nhandicap as an unlicensed AM<br />\nstation. Eight attempts have been<br />\nmade to convert the station to<br />\nFM, but none have ever been<br />\nsuccessful. It has been asserted<br />\nthat Gross sabotaged efforts to<br />\nmake the change, in order to<br />\navoid losing his commanding<br />\nposition within WJHU. Similarly,<br />\nstudents have argued that he<br />\nwithheld technical information<br />\nwhich would have enabled<br />\nstudents to run the station<br />\nwithout him.<br />\nSaid Minkowski: 'The<br />\nattempts to convert to FM failed<br />\nfor financial reasons. It is a long<br />\nprocess just to apply to the FCC,<br />\nand the FCC treats each<br />\napplication as a competitive bid.'<br />\nHe displayed an estimate for<br />\nconversion made in the 1960's<br />\nwhich put the cost at $75,000.<br />\nThe station has also received<br />\nletters from schools which have<br />\ninitiated FM broadcasting<br />\nennumerating their headaches,<br />\nfinancial and otherwise.<br />\n'Bill has an immense<br />\nknowledge of the technology of<br />\nsmall radio stations, even<br />\nprofessional ones,' continued<br />\nMinkowski. 'The equipment here<br />\nis old, and it takes quite an<br />\nability to run it. I think anyone<br />\nelse who tries to run the station<br /><br />\nwill have problems. Probably the<br />\nbest thing he could do would be<br />\nto contact Bill Gross.'<br />\n--What about Gross's health?<br />\nHe has been wearing a sling on<br />\nhis left arm for as long as anyone<br />\ncan remember: There have been<br />\nrumors that his condition has<br />\nrecently deteriorated, and that<br />\ndeath may even threaten him<br />\nsince he staunchly refuses to have<br />\nhis arm amputated.<br />\nAccording to Minkowski,<br />\n'Four or five years ago, an engine<br />\nfell on his arm. Since then, it has<br />\nbeen a chronic problem for Bill.<br />\nHe has osteomyelitis, an<br />\ninfection of the bone marrow,<br />\nwhich must be constantly<br />\nchntained.<br />\n'Bill refuses to have his arm<br />\namputated because he is a superb<br />\npianist. Instead, he has had a lot<br />\nof medical care, and a lot of<br />\nmedical expenses to pay. His<br />\ncondition is very serious,<br />\nalthough no basic difference in<br />\nhis health has come about<br />\nrecently.'<br />\n--Last Fall, WJHU's output \u2018w.<br />\nfound to be too high, in violation<br />\nof the FCC's standards.

Several people now<br />\nconnected with WJHU have<br />\nsuggested that Gross may have<br />\nintentionally stepped up the<br />\npower in order to make trouble<br />\nfor the station.<br />\nMinkowski called this<br />\n\"nonsense.\" 'What these people<br />\nrefuse to understand is that he is<br />\nreally devoted to the station. It's<br />\nvery hard to control the power<br />\noutput because of the shape of<br />\nthe antenna into which power is<br />\nfed (the wiring and heating<br />\nsystems of the dorms are used).<br />\n'Bill did a complete field study<br />\nof the antenna and got the<br />\nstation back on the air. He sent a<br />\nletter to the FCC, and they were<br />\nagreeable because they know that<br />\nBill is responsible. Bill had a good<br />\nreputation with the FCC.'<br />\n--It seems probable that the<br />\nstudents who deposed Gross did<br />\nso largely because of a<br />\npersonality conflict, and a<br />\nresultant power struggle . Jud<br />\nFrench would like to have Gross<br />\nwork with him, but Gross refuses<br />\nto even communicate with the<br />\nstation management.<br />\nMinkowski claimed that, 'The<br />\nyoung people didn't like the<br />\ndiscipline Bill imposed, especially<br />\nthe tight control he exercised<br />\nover the record library. It is one<br />\nof the best record libraries on the<br />\nEast Coast, with over 16,000<br />\nrecords worth over $100,000,<br />\nand some are irreplaceable. It was<br />\nbuilt up by Bill's efforts, and<br />\nwithout discipline, it would<br />\ndeteriorate.<br />\nThe \"young people\" are<br />\nunhappy right now because the<br />\npossessor of the key to the<br />\nrecord library has not given it to<br />\nthem. According to Minkowski,<br />\n'I have informed Dr. (George)<br />\nBenton that I will have it given to<br />\nhim when he requests it, that is,<br />\nwhen he feels that the station has<br />\nresponsible management.\"<br />\nMinkowski, however, does not<br />\npossess the key.<br /><br />\nGross did not actively attempt<br />\nto gain reelection as chief<br />\nengineer. He never considered the<br />\nelections legal, although the SAC<br />\nsanctioned them, and did not<br />\neven deign to show up. In fact,<br />\nhe has not been seen at all on<br />\ncampus lately, which makes it<br />\nseem probable that his health is<br />\nworse than Minkowski knew or<br />\nwould admit. No one can even<br />\nget in touch with Gross. `You<br />\ndon't get in touch with Gross; he<br />\ngets in touch with you,\" said<br />\nLarry Kenney, former record<br />\nlibrarian at WJHU and a close<br />\nassociate of Gross's.<br />\nThe newly elected managing<br />\nboard of WJHU issued the<br />\nfollowing statement in response<br />\nto the comments of Dr.<br />\nMinkowski:<br />\nIn all its contacts with the<br />\nadministration, the current<br />\nmanaging board of WJHU has<br />\nbeen urged to place ipolitics and<br />\nprevious problems behind it and<br />\nconcentrate all its efforts in two<br />\nvery vital areas: (1) solidifying<br />\nthe AM radio operations at Johns<br />\nHopkins; and (2) developing a<br />\nconcrete and final proposal for<br />\nconversion to FM stereo<br />\nbroadcasting during the coming<br />\nyear. The board and staff are<br />\nnow working diligently on these<br />\npositive actions and have made<br />\nvery good headway in only a few<br />\nshort weeks. The board sees no<br />\nneed to continue useless debate,<br />\nor to belabor past issues, of no<br />\nrelevance to the station's present<br />\nor future.<br />\nStation Manager Don Osborne,<br />\nFrench, and the rest are<br />\nconvinced that they can maintain<br />\nand even improve the station<br />\noperation, even if it means being<br />\nwithout Bill Gross. But in the<br />\npast, it has always been the<br />\nstudents who moved on, and<br />\nGross who stayed, and that will<br />\nbe hard to change. It is difficult<br />\nto conclude that Bill Gross, the<br />\nman who has made WJHU his<br />\nlife, will not find his way back<br />\ninto power again, if he survives to<br />\nhave a chance.<br /><br />\nThE<br /><br />\nNEWS-IETTER<br /><br />\nvol. lxxx no. 46Ituesday, april 20, 1976Ibaltimore, maryland180th :mar<br /><br />\nbudget<br />\n(Today we offer a guest editorial: a quotation from<br />\nsophomore class President Scott Burleson)<br />\n\"To cut the News-Letter budget is offensive.

In the same<br />\nspirit, then, I would appreciate it<br />\nif others on the Committee<br />\nwould not try to represent my<br />\nviews, especially when such<br />\nrepresentation becomes<br />\nmisrepresentation. The case in<br />\npoint is with regard to the<br />\nbudgeting of the News-Letter.<br />\nLet me be explicit in the<br />\nbeginning: I voted in favor of<br />\ngiving the News-Letter a zero<br />\nSAC budget figure for 1976-77.<br />\nMy reasons for doing so,<br />\nhowever, are somewhat different<br />\nfrom those of other members on<br />\nthe Committee, at least different<br />\nfrom what Ron Bialek has<br />\nexpressed those views to be.<br />\nI am sure that no one is<br />\nunaware that there have been<br />\nproblems this year with regard to<br />\nthe News-Letter. No one,<br />\nincluding the editors I'm sure, is<br />\ncompletely satisfied with the<br />\nNews-Letter. At the same time,<br />\nmost students would agree that a<br />\nstudent-run Hopkins newspaper<br />\nis desirable, perhaps even<br />\nnecessary. I see mainly three<br />\nproblems that have been voiced,<br />\neach of differing importance.<br />\nOne of these problems is not,<br />\nhowever, the question of salaries.<br />\nThat problem was dealt with and,<br />\nI thought, concluded last year. I<br />\nam fairly certain that particular<br />\nsalaries are necessary, and the<br />\nonly questionable area may be in<br />\nthe size of the salaries, and that<br />\nissue has not been raised in this<br />\nyear's budgeting.<br />\nWhat has been most frequently<br />\nvoiced as a problem concerns the<br />\ncontent and editorial policy of<br />\nthe paper. It has been suggested<br />\nthat not enough news about<br />\nJohns Hopkins, the Homewood<br />\ncampus in particular, has been<br />\nprinted. Coupled with this<br />\ncomplaint is that the News-Letter<br />\nhas failed to give adequate<br />\ncoverage to student government<br />\nand to student organizations in<br />\ngeneral. This complaint became<br />\nparticularly noticeable around<br />\nthe time of Student Council<br />\nelections when many students<br />\nfelt that they didn't know<br />\nenough about the candidates or<br />\nstudent government to make an<br />\nintelligent decision. The Friday<br />\nfeatures issue of the News-Letter<br />\nhas particularly (but . not<br />\nexclusively) come under attack,<br />\nmany urging that the material<br />\nprinted is rubbish (verbage,<br />\nuseless) or at least inappropriate.<br />\nRegardless of the merits of the<br />\narguments, the complaints have<br />\nbeen made and not by a few.<br />\nA second problem that has not<br />\nbeen so widely voiced, but which<br />\nis in my view equally important,<br />\nis that is has been alleged that the<br />\nstaff of the News-Letter has been<br />\nabused by its management, or at<br />\nthe very least that the working<br />\natmosphere at the Gatehouse has<br />\nbeen less than desirable.<br />\nImportantly, this is an item that<br />\nhas been raised from within the<br />\nNews-Letter, by both present and<br />\nformer staff members, both on<br />\nthe masthead and off of it. The<br />\nSAC Executive Committee spent<br />\nmuch of the Fall semester (to be<br />\nsure, probably too much of it)<br /><br />\ndealing with such a problem. The<br />\nNews-Letter freely admits that it<br />\nis having difficulty in obtaining<br />\nand holding on to sufficient<br />\nnumbers of staff members. In<br />\nfact, a member of the N-L<br />\nproduction team told me that the<br />\npaper may be forced to go to<br />\nonly one issue a week due to not<br />\nhaving enough people working on<br />\nit. The editors suggest that this is<br />\ndue to the amount of work and<br />\ndedication required. This may or<br />\nmay not be true, but the point is<br />\nthat there are complaints coming<br />\nfrom staff members to the<br />\ncontrary.<br />\nThe third problem is less<br />\nsignificant, but a problem just<br />\nthe same. Many campus<br />\norganizations claim that<br />\nNews-Letter ad rates for campus<br />\norganizations are too high, and<br />\nthat the service that they receive<br />\nis inadequate. This inadequacy of<br />\nservice includes complaints that<br />\nlayout is poor, that there are too<br />\nmany added costs, requirements<br />\nare too complicated, and that<br />\nworking with N-L people to get<br />\nan ad printed is anything but<br />\npleasant. Indeed, it is suggested<br />\nthat News-Letter ad service is<br />\ntypical of any organization that<br />\nhas a monopoly in its area; i.e. if<br />\nyou don't like the service, where<br />\nelse are you to go?<br />\nAll of these problems have<br />\nat one time or another, in some<br />\nform or another, come before the<br />\nSAC Executive Committee. The<br />\npowers and function of the SAC<br />\nare summed up as the promotion: and<br />\nregulation of student activities on<br />\nthe Homewood campus. I would<br />\nagree that, at least for the time<br />\nthat I'm aware of its activities,<br />\nthe SAC has done too little<br />\npromotion and possibly too<br />\nmuch regulation, but I think that<br />\nthis is more reflective of what the<br />\nChairman has steered toward the<br />\nCommission and its Executive<br />\nCommittee than it is of the<br />\npotential of the organization.<br />\nRegulation need not be the nasty<br />\nthing that it sounds like, and it<br />\nhas been my intention that it not<br />\nbe. If it has, I think that this was<br />\nmore the result of execution than<br />\nof a desired policy. In fact, only<br />\nfour organizations this past year<br />\nhave had to suffer any kind of<br />\nregulation, and in at least one of<br />\nthese instances I don't think that<br />\nyou will find any complaints(ask<br />\nthe people over at WJHU) other<br />\nthan that the Executive<br />\nCommittee was not involved<br />\nenough. The power of regulation<br />\nitself that the SAC possesses is<br />\nseeing<br />\ncircumscribed to<br />\nthat organizations operate<br />\nroughly within their budgets, and<br />\nensuring that organizations<br />\noperate according to how they<br />\nwere constitutionally chartered.<br />\nThe first role emanates from the<br />\nresponsibility that the SAC has<br />\nto member organizations in the<br />\njust distribution and use of<br />\nlimited student activities funds,<br />\nin ensuring that no organization<br />\nmisuses funds that could<br />\notherwise have been used by<br />\nanother SAC member group. The<br />\nsecond role comes from the<br />\nresponsibility that the SAC has<br />\nto the individual students making<br />\nup the membership of the SAC<br />\ngroups, in ensuring that<br />\nindividuals are treated fairly<br />\nwithin, and have access to, each<br /><br />\ngroup as outlined in its own<br />\nparticular constitution.<br />\nWhat all of this means to me is<br />\nthat it is incumbent upon the<br />\nSAC, and its Executive<br />\nCommittee, to at least give ear<br />\nwhen it receives complaints that<br />\nan organization is violating one<br />\nof the above and to take the<br />\nnecessary action if the complaint<br />\nis justified. As I have shown,<br />\nthere have been complaints in at<br />\nleast three areas with regard to<br />\nthe News-Letter, and it has been<br />\nthe duty of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee to deal with them.<br />\nUnfortunately, the SAC has<br />\nbeen asked too frequently to deal<br />\nwith complaints concerning the<br />\nNews-Letter. It has been dealing<br />\nwith these problems,some of them<br />\nfrequent problems, that<br />\nproduced the present budgetary<br />\nrecommendation by the SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee to the<br />\nbody of the whole SAC. Not at<br />\nall as a punitive measure, I see<br />\nthe decision as a long term<br />\nsolution that is beneficial for the<br />\nNews- Letter, student<br />\ngovernment, and the students<br />\nalike. My vote on the<br />\nNews-Letter appropriation was<br />\ntied to another vote in the<br />\n1976-77 SAC budget: the<br />\nallocation of funds for the<br />\ncreation of a second student<br />\npublication here at Homewood. I<br />\ncould not have voted one<br />\nwithout the other.<br />\nThe News-Letter is a weird<br />\ncreature among SAC groups for a<br />\nnumber of reasons. First of all,<br />\nthe SAC Exedutive Committee<br />\nhas singularly had difficulties in<br />\nthe carrying out of its<br />\nresponsibilities with regard to the<br />\nNews-Letter. Each time that the<br />\nCommittee has tried-to deal with<br />\nthe paper the N-L people have<br />\njumped up on the soap-box and<br />\ncried censorship. This is a<br />\nparticularly hard cry to combat,<br />\nwhether or not it is justified,<br />\nbecause of the sensitivity of most<br />\npeople to the issue. Even<br />\nsuggestions that the News-Letter<br />\npay more attention to the<br />\nHomewood campus and less to<br />\nCharles Village were met with<br />\ncries of violation of freedom of<br />\nthe press. The present<br />\ncontroversy serves as another<br />\nexample of this, even though<br />\nabsolutely no mention was made<br />\nabout editorial policy and format<br />\nin the budget notification sent to<br />\nthe News-Letter, and had such a<br />\nrecommendation been made in<br />\nthe Executive Committee I<br />\nwould have strongly fought it.<br />\nThe cries, though unjustified, are<br />\nrather understandable, for<br />\nbudgeting and appropriations is a<br />\nvery sensitive time for SAC<br />\ngroups. What is not sufficiently<br />\nunderstood is that a zero budget<br />\nappropriation (self-sufficient)<br />\nNews-Letter is probably the best<br />\nsituation for improved relations<br />\nbetween it and the SAC. The<br />\nNews-Letter no longer has to fear<br />\nSAC control through the power<br />\nof the purse-strings (the SAC's<br />\nmost potent, but rarely used,<br />\nweapon), and the SAC no longer<br />\nhas to suffer accusations of using<br />\nthis power for censorship each<br />\ntime that it touches on an issue<br />\nconcerning the paper.<br /><br />\nSee ABERNATHY,page 7/<br /><br />\nPhilosopher's incarnation<br /><br />\nphoto by Jennifer bishop<br /><br />\n'Eat your carrots, son.'<br />\nBy WES PARDUE<br />\nIt was a bright, sunny Friday.<br />\nThat alone was significant.<br />\nUsually, the weekdays were<br />\nbeautiful while each weekend<br />\npromised to be a deluge. This<br />\nweek had been different. This<br />\nweek we swam to class on<br />\nTuesday and Wednesday. Friday<br />\nwas clear. Portentious, I thought.<br />\n\u2022 I walked back from the<br />\nstudent union having once again<br />\ngazed into an empty mailbox. I<br />\nknew that in a week it would fill<br />\nand I would join the smug group<br />\nopening boxes and pulling out<br />\nletters\u2014my birthday was near.<br />\nTwenty years. And what to show<br />\nfor it? As a child, I had thought<br />\nthat by now I would surely be a<br />\nmillionaire, have world fame,<br />\nand, most of all, have<br />\ntremendous knowledge.<br />\nInstead\u2014well, I was still- in<br />\nschool, known only to myself,<br />\nand frequently had difficulty<br />\ndeciding whether to wear brown<br />\nor blue socks with my attire.<br />\nThings had changed less than<br /><br />\nexpected.<br />\nWalking between the library<br />\nand Foster Hall I came upon a<br />\ngroup of first graders. A woman<br />\nof about thirty was instructing<br />\nthem - that there were classes<br />\ngoing on and it was imperative<br />\nthat they be quiet. The boys and<br />\ngirls were holding hands\u2014boys<br />\nwith boys and girls with girls. In<br />\na few years you'll be embarrassed<br />\nto do that, I thought. Too bad. It<br />\nwould probably help if we all<br />\ntouched a bit more.<br />\nApparition<br />\nThe teacher was explaining<br />\nabout the natural science exhibit<br />\nthey were about to see in Foster<br />\nHall. As I was listening to her<br />\nfount of misinformation I was<br />\nstartled to see a slight boy with<br />\ndeep set brown eyes looking at<br />\nme. I don't know if he saw his<br />\nfuture self by looking at me, but<br />\nI certainly saw myself in him. It<br />\nwas an apparition from my past,<br />\neven to the detail of standing<br />\nprecariously balanced on the left<br />\nfoot, the right raised and placed<br /><br />\nagainst the left knee, with hands<br />\non hips. He had his head cocked<br />\nto the left and as we looked at<br />\neach other I knew I must pass on<br />\nsome jewel, some guiding light,<br />\nto lead him on. What had I<br />\nlearned in twenty years? As I<br />\nracked my brain, he squinted<br />\nmyopically and I realized that<br />\nsoon he\u2014I\u2014would be getting<br />\nglasses.<br />\nFour eyes. Dropped footballs.<br />\nMissed baskets.<br />\nI stepped forward and gave<br />\nhim twenty years of regrets. The<br />\nclass was now shuffling noisily<br />\ntoward the museum. I cleared my<br />\nthroat. \"Eat your carrots.\" I<br />\nadjusted my glasses to punctuate.<br />\nHe frowned, disgusted. Surely he<br />\nwould have more to reveal after<br />\ntwenty years. He turned away,<br />\ntook two steps, and tripped over<br />\na large oak root. I rolled my eyes,<br />\ntook two steps, and bumped into<br />\na co-ed. I heard him laugh, and<br />\nsaw him run to catch up with the<br />\nrest of the class. The lesson was<br />\ntaught.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nLETTERS,from page 4<br />\ncompensation.<br />\nOverall I would say that the<br />\nNews-Letter has done a highly<br />\ncommendable job, and that the<br />\nSAC is totally unjustified in its<br />\nefforts to withhold funds.<br />\nEric Dennen<br />\nl' the Editor:<br />\nOnce again the SAC has<br />\ndisplayed its true colors. In their<br />\nde Sp otic attempts to dictate<br />\nstudent policy they have<br />\ndemonstrated that they are petty<br />\nquarreling politicians rather than<br />\nr epresentatives of the student<br />\nbody. Their latest attempt to<br />\nquash the News-Letter runs<br />\ndirectly counter to the wishes of<br />\nthe student body, as no doubt<br />\nthe petitions now circulating will<br />\nprove. The News-Letter is the<br />\nVoice of the Hopkins' community<br />\nas it has been for many years.<br />\nThe SAC's attempt to use<br />\nNews-Letter funds to start their<br />\nOwn publication is clearly an<br />\nexercise in self-aggrandisement.<br />\nWe believe we speak for a<br />\nmajority of the student body<br />\nWhen we say that a weekly<br />\nJournal of SAC activities is<br />\ncertainly not what this campus<br />\nWants or needs. The SAC has a<br />\nr esponsibility to the student<br />\nbody which they must not shirk.<br />\nJeff Adams<br />\nMarc W. Steinberg<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI regret having to disturb your<br />\nstate of complacency and<br />\ncontentment, but to the best of<br />\n'fly understanding, Hopkins<br />\nstudents do not share your most<br />\nmodest esteem of you paper.<br />\n(Perhaps the papers all disappear<br />\nnow because you distribute them<br />\nmore widely, in more ridiculous<br />\nPlaces. For instance, there is<br />\nahvays a pile rotting in the lobby<br />\nof my non-University apartment<br />\nbuilding.) Unfortunately, I and<br />\nnlanyof my colleagues have come<br />\nto regard the paper as a waste of<br /><br />\nSAC money. If you want to<br />\nprint, expounding on any whim<br />\nof your fancy, fine, but manage<br />\non the financial support of all<br />\nyour fans.<br />\nWith regard to your editorial<br />\non the editorial page, it is<br />\nunfortunate that you have such a<br />\nnarrow understanding of the<br />\ncampus parking regulations and<br />\ntheir enforcement. Without<br />\nexplaining here, I can state, as<br />\nyour former representative on<br />\nthe Traffic committee, that the<br />\nUniversity community can be<br />\nthankful that few of its members<br />\nexhibit the remarkable degree of<br />\nselfish, insensitive disrespect for<br />\nthe regulations that some<br />\nNews-Letter members have.<br />\nPaul Kromberg<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThis last, perhaps ultimate,<br />\noutrage the executive committee<br />\nof the SAC has attempted to<br />\nperpetrate against our beloved<br />\nAlma Mater in committing media<br />\nhomicide constrains us to a<br />\ncourse of action no other<br />\nmisguided, inept, impotent<br />\nstudent government over 12<br />\ncollective years at JHU has<br />\nmanaged to do: we have<br />\novercome utmost condescension<br />\nand contempt of student politics<br />\nto bring this indictment.<br />\nJ'accuse.<br />\nWe unequivocally attest to the<br />\nqualitative character of the<br />\npresent News-Letter as being the<br />\nbest in our realm of experience at<br />\nHopkins. Some charge the<br />\nNews-Letter with being an<br />\ninchoate, News American styled<br />\nrag; we submit that these, and<br />\nother criticisms, are irrelevant to<br />\nthe central issue, the gravaman of<br />\nthis indictment. The SAC is<br />\nmerely functioning in the grand<br />\nold style of student politics:<br />\nexceedingly petty, self-indulgent<br />\nand above all, self-serving.<br />\nWe rest assured knowing all<br />\nenlightened parties are familiar<br />\nwith the rationale in maintaining<br /><br />\nne autonomy of the<br />\nNews-Letter. However, the SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee would be<br />\nwell served in taking to heart the<br />\nvenerable maxim\u2014In propria<br />\ncausa, nemo judex (No one<br />\nshould be the judge in his own<br />\ncase) As elected representatives,<br />\nthe SAC should be painfully<br />\naware of who the judges are in<br />\nthis case.<br />\nJohn Morrison '74<br />\nS. Karlton Kop '74<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nBefore I start ranting and<br />\nraving, I'd better say this: I don't<br />\nknow any of the N-L staff by<br />\nsight let alone personally, and so<br />\nI have no reason to be biased for<br />\nor against them. All I know<br />\nabout the N-L is that I) It is now<br />\ngenerally better than it has been<br />\nat any time in the last three<br />\nyears; 2) It is by far the best<br />\nstudent newspaper in Maryland<br />\n(doubters take a Peek at the<br />\nLoyola Greyhound); 3) The<br />\nmoney that the SAC proposes to<br />\ndeny it, comes ultimately from<br />\nmy tuition, and by God if it<br />\ndoesn't get that money I'll<br />\nfucking know the reason why.<br />\nJesus Christ, can't those pussies<br />\nstand criticism!? The N-L has<br />\ndone more for this academic<br />\nhole-in-the-wall than all the<br />\nvarious council members,<br />\npresidents, treasurer,<br />\nrepresentatives, and other<br />\nassholes combined, and don't<br />\nyou forget it! Fuck you too!<br />\n(pause for deep -breath). . .Ah,<br />\nwell, it is a fact I have known<br />\nsince high school (where one of<br />\nour beloved leaders, who shall<br />\nremain nameless, was class<br />\npresident) that any student who<br />\nruns for a student office and<br />\nactually cares who wins is<br />\nautomatically and ipso facto an<br />\nasshole. SAC execs, April,<br />\nSheldon, et. al., if you're still<br />\nreading this, consider: it is not<br />\nonly the privilege but the duty of<br />\nthe press to give the government<br /><br />\nshit, and keep them humble. The<br />\nNews-Letter is doing a fine job,<br />\nand deserves both our continued<br />\neconomic support and our<br />\nthanks.<br />\nThomas Olson '77<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is true that this _year the<br />\nNews-Letter and I have differed<br />\nin opinion about practically<br />\neverything. I am aware of the<br />\ndegree of respect that the<br />\nNews-Letter staff assigns my<br />\ndecisions. But in this case I<br />\ncannot leave the News-Letter to<br />\nprint totally erroneous facts<br />\nabout me. The article on pg. 4 of<br />\nthe April 16 N-L that concerns<br />\nitself with my task force<br />\nselection of a band for the senior<br />\nclass party contains, in no<br />\nmanner, a word of truth. I was<br />\nnot interviewed for this<br />\ninformation, nor was Susan<br />\nWeiss, who did play an integral<br />\npart in the Band selection. I do<br />\nnot know the source of Russ<br />\nSmith's article, but it is an<br />\nunreliable one.<br />\nI have never, in any way, been<br />\nassociated with the Senior Class<br />\nGraduation Planning Committee;<br />\nthe Social Committee does not<br />\nwork in conjunction with this<br />\ncommittee. Neither the Social<br />\nCommittee nor myself personally<br />\nwas assigned the task of securing<br />\na band .for the graduation party.<br />\nmember<br />\nof<br />\nIn February, a<br />\nthe Committee called me up and<br />\nasked me to give ,my opinion of<br />\nseveral bands that they were<br />\nconsidering hiring for the Senior<br />\nClass Dance., I told the person<br />\nthat frankly Man's Theory was a<br />\ngood band but a bit expensive<br />\n(but I don't think the Student<br />\nCentennial Birthday Bash was an<br />\nexclusive audience, by any<br />\nmeans); that Fancy Colours was<br />\nalso a fine band although<br />\nexpensive but were more the<br />\n\"prom-type\" band that I felt the<br />\noccasion called for; that Ocean<br />\nRose was a fine band, not one<br /><br />\nthat was my particular favorite,<br />\nwere indisputably Hopkins<br />\naffiliated and were a more<br />\nreasonable price; and finally I<br />\nsaid that London Fogg, when<br />\nthey had played for the Council<br />\nlast fall, had not given a good<br />\nperformance, nor had they been<br />\nparticularly cooperative but the<br />\npossibility exists that they had<br />\nimproved. All of these statements<br />\nwere given as my personal<br />\nopinion which was solicited; I<br />\nwas never contacted again. I was<br />\nnot informed at the time that my<br />\nviews would be the deciding<br />\nfactor in the band selection.<br />\nAfter a little research into the<br />\nfinal outcome, I was told by<br />\nSusan Weiss that the Committee<br />\nlistened to all the bands<br />\nnominated, discussed pros and<br />\ncons of each arrangement and<br />\nthen voted, in the democratic<br />\nmanner, to have Fancy Colours.<br />\nAnd so, in that way, I have<br />\nbecome personally responsible<br />\nfor yet another disastrous social<br />\ndecision.<br />\nI realize the News-Letter feels<br />\nthat the free press is the only<br />\npress, as do I. I also happen to<br />\nfeel that the only press is the<br />\ncorrect press. I have often<br />\nthought the N-L prints very<br />\nselective news, but as long as this<br />\nnews is correct then they are<br />\nwithin their rights. However I<br />\nthink that this time they have<br />\ngone beyond the realm of good<br />\nor even adequate journalism and<br />\nare now in the business known as<br />\nthel yellow press. (The manner of<br />\npresentation is not even<br />\narticulate, but one that I found<br />\nto be on the order of verbal<br />\nabuse.) As much as I am opposed<br />\nto the recent SAC budget cut of<br />\nthe N-L funds, I see no reason to<br />\nfund, buy or read a paper that<br />\nchooses to establish a reputation<br />\nfor publishing illegitimate and<br />\nunsubstantiated material.<br />\nApril Moreno<br />\nClass of'76<br /><br />\ne 6/news-letter/april 20, 1976<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022:\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\no \u00b0bondnao nonononnnon=onauamloor]0[000propip=ofo.000100<br /><br />\nJHU Centennial Picnic<br />\nApril 24, 1976<br /><br />\nSENIOR CLASS<br />\nPARTY<br />\nFREE PIZZA<br />\nsilo BEER<br /><br />\nENTERTAINMENT,<br /><br />\nii<br /><br />\nFOOD &amp; DRINK<br />\nCOST<br />\n$1.00 - homewood community<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nFriday, April 23<br />\n9:00 p.m.<br /><br />\n$2.50 - others<br />\nsponsored by the student centennial<br />\ncommittee for the ENJOYMENT of the<br />\nhomewood community: STUDENTS,<br />\nFACULTY,EMPLOYEES and<br />\ntheir families<br />\nmembers of the SAGA meal plan may exchange<br />\nlunch at the dorms for a picnic ticket<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022.\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n\u2022.\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022:.<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nDorm Cafeteria<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022<br />\n:<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022.\u2022<br />\n.\u2022..\u2022<br />\nseniors and their guests only<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nii<br /><br />\nii<br />\niJ<br /><br />\ntickets on sale at the Union Desk<br />\nsign up for team sports in your department<br />\n,gMXENA,DLUAAWNDWDELICEADEMEAag(=lobo00<br />\nw..Le.\"-E.\"210Egii.0011311100 MD.\u2022MM0011E<br /><br />\n**************************************************<br />\n*<br />\n* CLASS OFFICERS FINAL ELECTION!

This<br />\nbrings us to another reason why<br />\nthe News- Letter is such a weird<br />\ncreature. Unlike most other<br />\nnewspapers enjoying freedom of<br />\nthe press in the United States,<br /><br />\nthe News-Letter is responsible to<br />\nno one, particularly to its<br />\nreaders. It earns money on ad<br />\nrevenue, part of which is<br />\nobtained because of a monopoly<br />\nof the campus market, and the<br />\nrest of its money is handed to it<br />\nin a yearly budget appropriation<br />\n(although this budget<br />\nappropriation averages only 12%<br />\nof their total budget). In this<br /><br />\nThe Office of Special Events<br />\npresents<br />\nTHE GOUCHER-HOPKINSCHORUSIN CONCERT<br />\nprogram:<br />\nSymphony of the Psalms - Stravinsky<br />\nFive Songs on Old Texts - Hindemith<br />\nperformed by the Madrigal Singers<br />\nGloria - Poulenc<br /><br />\nsituation, the only real way of<br />\nbringing pressure to bear upon<br />\nthe News-Letter over editorial or<br />\nother policy is through the<br />\norganization that funds it, the<br />\nSAC. But most people find this<br />\ndistasteful, including this<br />\nmember of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee. By no longer funding<br />\nthe paper, and creating a<br />\ncompeting paper, pressure on<br />\neditorial policy will now come<br />\nfrom the readers, who will<br />\ndemonstrate their opinions<br />\nthrough their reactions to the<br />\ntwo different publications.<br />\nThis competition at the same<br />\ntime will solve whatever other<br />\nproblems may exist. If the staff<br />\nin truth is being misused, then<br />\nthey will have another outlet for<br />\ntheir journalistic and related<br />\ntalents, and the management of<br />\nthe News-Letter will be forced to<br />\nchange its policies or lose its<br /><br />\nstaff. The same would hold true<br />\nto criticisms over ad service if<br />\nindeed a problem there does<br />\nexist. One further advantage that<br />\nbecomes apparent is that as the<br />\nNews-Letter has been becoming<br />\nincreasingly a political actor on<br />\nthe campus the potential for<br />\nmisuse of its monopoly on press<br />\ndistribution of information<br />\nbecomes greater. Indeed,<br />\naccusations of such misuse have<br />\nalready been heard. The creation<br />\nof competitive papers would<br />\neliminate the grounds for<br />\ncomplaint.<br />\nThere is one catch to this, a<br />\nbig one maybe. The<br />\nestablishment of a second<br />\nnewspaper, one that is not just a<br />\nrag for student government, will<br />\nbe no easy task. It will involve<br />\nthe work and enthusiasm of a<br />\ngood number of students. The<br />\nneed is there, the benefits are<br /><br />\ngreat, and I feel that there also<br />\nexists the desire. President-elect<br />\nSteve Ponchak promised that he<br />\nwill do what he can (and that<br />\nshould be considerable) to get a<br />\nnew paper started. Let's hold him<br />\nto his word. The SAC is giving<br />\nhim the opportunity.<br />\nI'll be the first one to admit<br />\nthat this a gamble, but I think<br />\nthat the potential<br />\ndividends are worth it.<br />\nI also feel that the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity is willing to support<br />\nsuch a move, without which<br />\nsupport it will be impossible to<br />\nimplement. I may be wrong, and<br />\nnot for the first time. If I am,<br />\nthen let me know.

Hopkins now<br />\nholds an overall record of 7-6,<br />\nincluding a 5-3 mark in<br />\nMAC-divisional play.<br />\nThe twin-bill, played on<br />\nWidener's home turf in Chester,<br />\nPennsylvania, proved to be one<br />\nof sharp contrasts. The first game<br />\nwas totally dominated by the<br />\nhome team while the second<br />\ncontest saw a complete reversal<br />\n.of roles.<br /><br />\nteam in the country.\"<br />\nJust as he had done in the first<br />\nhalf Cornell's Brian Lasda<br />\ncontrolled the opening face-off<br />\nof the second half and then<br />\nDybus opened the second half<br />\nscoring just as he'd done in the<br />\nfirst, by tallying with a minute<br />\ngone, upping the Big Red's lead<br />\nto 10-6. Not only was this the<br />\nlargest lead of the game but it<br />\nwas the biggest deficit by which<br />\nthe Blue Jays had fallen behind<br />\nall season; a record which proved<br />\nshort-lived.<br />\nNearly eleven minutes passed<br />\nbefore the next score but during<br />\nthat time the tone of the contest<br />\nunderwent an unaccountably<br />\nradical change.<br />\nOne would have thought that<br />\nit was Cornell who was the home<br />\nteam and spirited underdog<br />\nrather than vice versa. The Big<br />\nRed certainly played the part<br />\nperfectly. They outhustled and<br />\noutmuscled the Blue Jays,<br />\nbeating (literally) to every key<br />\nground ball.\\ Their defense<br />\nexhibited the aggressive<br />\ndouble teaming tactics which<br />\nHopkins had expected but<br />\nunaccountably didn't seem<br />\nprepared to handle.<br />\nThe Jays became unglued. The<br />\nfew times that they could get the<br />\nball away from the New Yorkers<br />\nthe hosts came down the field<br />\nand, showing no organization at<br />\nall, either went one-on-one and<br />\nti lost the ball on a double-team, or<br />\ncame down and fired a wild shot<br />\nor errant pass.<br />\n-el Meanwhile the Hopkins<br />\ndefense was doing its part.<br />\nForced to contend with the<br />\nobvious obstacle of having the<br />\nball down in their end for<br />\npractically the entire second half,<br />\ndefensemen Jim Moorhead (who<br />\nplayed McEneaney admirably<br />\nconsidering his heavily taped leg<br />\ndue to pulled ligaments),<br />\nfreshman Mike Sheedy, Chad<br />\nMarrison, Mike Connor, and<br />\ngoalie Kevin Mahon held the<br />\ncountry's most potent attack<br />\nunit to one goal in the first<br />\nthirteen minutes of the third<br />\nquarter despite the ineffectual<br />\nplay of their mates.<br />\nIn fact it was the defense<br />\nwhich looked as if it would<br />\nsupply the spark to ignite the<br />\nHopkins attack which looked as<br /><br />\nif it had gone into early<br />\nhibernation. Sheedy after<br />\ncarrying the ball agross midfield<br />\non a clear, took a feed from<br />\nat tackman Richie Hirsch and<br />\nfired it past Cornell goalie Dan<br />\nMackesey for the Jays' first tally<br />\nof the second half. That cut the<br />\nBig Red's lead to 10-7 and<br />\ninstilled optimism in the hearts<br />\nof Homewood fans and<br />\nseemingly, new-found confidence<br />\nin the Homewood stickmen.<br />\nHowever that was not to be<br />\nthe case. Sheedy's goal was just a<br />\nmomentary pause in the course<br />\nof the inevitable result.<br />\nThe lifeless lack-luster way the<br />\nBlue Jays played after<br />\nintermission had predestined<br />\nthem for humiliating defeat.<br />\nLittle did anyone know at the<br />\ntime that the freshman<br />\ndefenseman s goal was to be the<br />\nonly Hopkins score of the second<br />\nhalf, an incredible statistic<br />\npractically unheard of in<br />\nHopkins lacrosse annals.<br />\nCornell continued right where<br />\nthey had left off before Sheedy<br />\nhad so rudely interrupted them.<br />\nThey physically intimidated the<br />\nBlue Jays in the Jays backyard.<br />\nCoach Richie Moran's troops<br /><br />\nbaffled the Jays' vain attempts to<br />\nride them, clearing the ball with<br />\nrelative ease.<br />\nEn route to outscoring<br />\nHopkins 6-1 in the disastrous<br />\nsecond half, Cornell notched the<br />\nlast two scores of the thrid<br />\nquarter on goals by Billy Marino<br />\nfrom Henrickson and<br />\nMcEneaney unassisted to give<br />\nthem a 12-7 lead.<br />\nThe futile play of the Hopkins<br />\nten culminated in the fourth<br />\nquarter. The Blue Jays didn't get<br />\nthe ball across midfield for nearly<br />\nfive 6,11 minutes in a display of<br />\nhapless frustration which<br />\nold time fans of Homewood<br />\nlacrosse called \"the worst<br />\nlacrosse ever played by a Hopkins<br />\nteam on Homewood Field.\"<br />\nCoach Ciccarone's charges are<br />\ncertainly in one enviable position<br />\nbeing that they have it within<br />\ntheir grasp to do something<br />\nabout their situation rather than<br />\nhaving to rely on others to<br />\nelevate their status for them.<br />\nUpcoming games with<br />\nonce beaten Brown, and<br />\nunbeaten Navy and Maryland<br />\ncould certainly change the course<br />\nof the season.
