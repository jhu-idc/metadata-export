All decisions will be<br />\nfinalized next Wednesday afternoon at a<br />\ngeneral SAC meeting in the Great Hall at<br />\n5:00 P.M.<br />\nThe News-Letter's annual expenditures<br />\ntotal approximately $30,000. Eighty per<br />\ncent of that sum is obtained through<br />\nadvertising; the remainder has traditionally<br />\nbeen supplied by the SAC, the group which<br />\nfunds all Hopkins student organizations. In<br />\norder for the paper to survive financially,<br />\nthe $6,000 is essential.<br />\nThis is not the first ^time that the<br />\nNews-Letter has had difficulty in<br />\nbargaining for these funds. Last May, after<br />\nseveral heated arguments, the News-Letter<br />\nwas awarded $5500. In that case, the SAC<br />\nquestioned whether the paper should have<br />\nany paid employees. They insisted that no<br />\nstaff member, in any capacity, should be<br />\npaid for their efforts. They were sure that<br />\nmost people would continue to work<br />\nstripped of salary, out of their dedication<br />\nto the paper.<br />\nWe felt then, as we do now, that this<br />\nrationale is not only naive but invalid as<br />\nwell. First of all, very few staff members<br />\nare paid for their services. Those who do<br />\nget paid are involved in the technical aspect<br />\nof the News-Letter, the behind-the-scenes<br />\ndrudgery that is necessary to produce any<br />\nnewspaper. These paid staffers work on<br />\npaste-up, typing, distribution and similar<br />\ntasks. There is no glory in this kind of<br />\nwork, no by-lines or picture credits. And<br />\nnot everyone in this category is paid--we<br />\njust can't afford it.<br />\nFurthermore, the wages are nowhere<br />\nnear the king's ransom that the SAC feels<br />\nwe are handing out. A production assistant<br />\nis paid fifteen dollars an issue. Usually they<br />\nwork from ten in the evening until seven<br />\nthe next morning. Even with salaries, we<br />\nare short on help; if salaries are eliminated,<br />\nfew will toil for the News\u2014Letter. And<br />\njustifiably so.<br />\nUnlike most college papers, the<br />\nNews-Letter offers not a penny to its<br />\neditors. No one at the News\u2014letter is<br />\nrewarded with academic credit for his or<br />\nher work.<br />\nThis time around with the SAC,<br />\nhowever, there are other conflicts as well.<br />\nThe SAC executive committee is convinced<br />\nthe the News-Letter is shirking its<br />\nobligation to the student body because of<br />\nthe content of this year's paper. They say<br />\nthat the News-Letter should be primarily<br />\nan informative publication, one that deals<br />\n<br />\nmainly with student news. Ron Bialek has<br />\nsaid that \"the News-Letter's only<br />\naccomplishment this year has been to hurt<br />\nthe jHU undergraduates.\"<br />\nWhat they really mean to say is that the<br />\nNews-Letter has ceased to be merely a<br />\npublicity organ for the student government<br />\nand administration.<br />\nIn particular, the SAC executive<br />\ncommittee is displeased with the Friday<br />\neditions of the News- Letter claiming<br />\nthat a \"magazine-features\" format has no<br />\nplace on a college campus. They describe<br />\nthe paper as \"too literary and cavalier,\" or<br />\n\"filled with bullshit.\" They maintain that a<br />\nmajority of the student body is dissatisfied<br />\nwith the Friday News-Letter, suggested by<br />\nmythical stacks of leftover papers.<br />\nWell, these charges just aren't true. Not<br />\nonly has the News-Letter increased<br />\ncirculation this year, but by our estimates<br />\n-more people arc reading the News-Letter<br />\ntoday than at any time in its eighty year<br />\nhistory.<br />\nWe have received,unprecedented acclaim<br />\nfrom a broad mixture of students, faculty,<br />\nadministration, and community residents.<br />\nIt is clear to us that the News-Letter is<br />\nmore popular today than ever before. At<br />\nthe very least, the constituency of the<br />\nNews-Letter has changed. Last year's critics<br />\nare supporters, while our current detractors<br />\nare former friends of the paper. A<br />\nnewspaper never has unanimous approval.<br />\nWe have enough problems simply<br />\nproducing the paper without additional<br />\nburdens thrust upon us by the SAC. We<br />\nhave scores of critics, none of whom are<br />\nwilling to work at the News-Letter to help<br />\nenact their desired changes in policy.<br />\nBattles with the SAC only further drain an<br />\noverworked staff.<br />\nWe're proud of the work we've<br />\naccomplished this year at the News-Letter<br />\nand are confident that our readers will<br />\nexpress their support. We're also sure that<br />\nthe student body would much rather have<br />\nthe paper in its present form as opposed to<br />\nthe prospect of no paper at all.<br />\nWhat it comes down to is thiE: if the<br />\nNews-Letter's funds are withdrawn, there<br />\nwill be virtually<br />\nno student newspaper<br />\nhere next semester. The SAC may feel that<br />\nby withholding funds they can create a<br />\ncampus mouthpiece. But it seems to us that<br />\nwe're being victimized by a vocal minority<br />\nof student politicians.<br />\nWe will not compromise our 'policies to<br />\nconform with the SAC's narrow conception<br />\nof a school newspaper's purpose. It is our<br />\nresponsibility to produce the finest<br />\nnewspaper we can. And that we'll continue<br />\nto do, SAC or no SAC.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/april 16, 1976<br />\n<br />\nmeetings<br />\nThere will be a meeting of the JHU<br />\nPhoto Club tonight, 8 p.m. in Conf.<br />\nRoom A.

(For<br />\nexample, the problem of not<br />\nhaving enough doctors in the<br />\nrural areas.) There are<br />\nopportunities to learn from the<br />\nIranian experience.<br />\nBesides the natural jcuriosity<br />\nto explore and learn, Hopkins<br />\nhad only two criteria for<br />\nbecoming physically involved:<br />\nthat they be invited, and that<br />\nthey feel they could help.<br />\nThe audience asked Dr.<br />\nMorgan questions after he<br />\nfinished speaking. The problem<br />\nwas raised as to how the<br />\nUniversity could trust Ashraf,<br />\nconsidering the questions about<br />\nthe royal family.<br />\nDr. Morgan agreed that<br />\nthere was ,always the possibility<br />\nof political people abusing the<br />\nprogam. He expressed his<br />\ndisappointment that the majority<br />\nof the governments in the world<br />\ntoday seemed to be leaning<br />\ntowards totalitarianism.<br />\nHowever, Dr. Morgan reiterated<br />\nhis belief that Hopkins was<br />\nhelping people, and that \"as long<br />\nas we are humanitarian<br />\nphysicians\" the program will<br />\ncontinue.<br />\nPeople wanted to<br />\nknow about the financial aspects<br />\nof the program. Morgan was<br />\npleased to announce that the<br />\ncosts of the program are covered<br />\nby the Iranians. The University is<br />\nreimbursed for the time faculty<br />\nmembers are away. Dr. Morgan<br />\npointed out that \"historically,<br />\nthis is one of the few programs<br />\nwhere the cost has been borne<br />\nprimarily by the inviting<br />\nagency.\"<br />\nIn the wake of Dr. Morgan's<br />\npoint of view that the medical<br />\ncommunity should remain<br />\napolitical, one observer calmly<br />\nasked if they really could do such<br />\na thing. Are not all of us subject<br />\nto the same moral dilemmas?<br />\nWe have to face the fact that<br />\nthe Shah is using the prestigious<br />\nname of Hopkins, and it is<br />\ntherefore somewhat political<br />\nbecause the presence of Hopkins<br />\ndoes in some way, (no mat `2r<br />\nhow small), add respectability to<br />\nthe present Iranian governme it.<br />\nAnd although the awarding of<br />\nthat much ballyhooed honorary<br />\ndegree was not intended as a<br />\npolitical statement of any kind, it<br />\nunfortunately has become a<br />\npolitical act.<br />\nCan we wash our hands by<br />\ntalking only of humanitarianism?<br />\nAnd what about the other<br />\nextreme--can we wash our hands<br />\nby destroying a helpful program?<br />\nOne audience member<br />\nproposed that if we can not<br />\nrevoke Ashrars degree, then we<br />\nshould give one to a political<br />\nprisoner, or someone else who<br />\nhas worked in the program.<br />\nBut to quote Dr. Seidel one<br />\nlast time: \"I would hate to see<br />\nthe issue of the degree impair any<br />\nimpact we might have on he<br />\nhealth of Iran.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-lettedapril 16, 1976<br />\n<br />\nN-L poll<br />\n<br />\nYou pick 'em, we print 'em, but who's going to vote?<br />\nBy ERIC GARLAND<br />\nExpect tall Mo Udall to be<br />\nsitting in the Executive Office<br />\nnext year, if' the results of the<br />\n1976 News-Letter Presidential<br />\nPoll carry any weight.

College maintenance men were doing repairs<br />\ndownstairs, and had parked their van out front in order to<br />\nhave easy access to equipment. Security received notice of<br />\nthe vehicle, and ordered it to be moved or towed. The<br />\nworkers, after explaining to no avail, didn't worry<br />\nanyway--the University was only fining itself!<br />\nThese absurd actions are repeated daily with students. The<br />\ncampus cops drive strictly by the book, spending great<br />\namounts of time to enforce every picayune Caligulan<br />\nregulation. Meanwhile, the students are pressured by the city,.<br />\nwhich doesn't want all those JHU-people cars cluttering<br />\nBaltimore streets when they should park on campus.<br />\nRobert Larkin, Head of Security, apparently doesn't see<br />\nthe needless and irritating squeeze he is putting on students<br />\nand campus departments. Various divisions of the University<br />\nfind themselves forced to share inadequate parking spaces<br />\nwith other groups, and watch as the cops issue them tickets<br />\n(not to mention park in their spaces).<br />\nThe Student Council,\u2022 true to form, has failed to act<br />\ndecisively on the matter. They have a representative on the<br />\ncommittee which establishes the campus parking regulations;<br />\ngranted, one voice is rather slight, butl that single person has<br />\nnot received the backing to say something effective.<br />\nThis parking policy reflects a general University<br />\nshort-sightedness .in local administration. Physically, the<br />\ncampus will always have a traffic problem. With students,<br />\nfaculty, and employees burdened by this overwrought<br />\nsystem, the University should wake up to realize that it's<br />\ntowing itself away.<br />\n<br />\nAnother voice<br />\n<br />\nWe have a responsibility here<br />\nBy RIC PFEFFER<br />\nHey, what's all the fuss about?<br />\nSo; we gave an honorary degree<br />\nto the Shah's sister. So,<br />\neverybody knows she got it<br />\nbecause she is the sister of the<br />\nShah and because the Shah is<br />\nvery rich and very powerful, so<br />\nwhat. That's the way life is, and<br />\nanyway the issue is no longer<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nSo what if she's ,a dope<br />\npeddler, so what if she's a major<br />\nrepresentative and figurehead in a<br />\nregime universally recognized to<br />\nbe the most repressive in the<br />\nworld --and that's saying<br />\nsomething!<br />\nAnd after all, hasn't the<br />\npresident of Hopkins more-or-less<br />\napologized and more-or-less<br />\nadmitted he made a mistake?<br />\nHasn't the provost, who<br />\npersonally presented the award<br />\nto Princess Ashraf, been telling<br />\nfaculty members privately that<br />\nhe opposed the award all along?<br />\nAnd hasn't President Muller<br />\nindicated he wants a<br />\nuniversity-wide committee to<br />\nestablish some procedures for<br />\nawarding honorary degrees to<br />\nsafeguard in the future against<br />\nthe kind of \"mistakes\" in<br />\nhonoring the dishonorable that<br />\nthe award to Ashraf represents?<br />\nGee, it all sounds so good.<br />\nHumility in high places, concern<br />\nthat \"errors\" not be repeated. Of<br />\ncourse, on the other hand, it also<br />\nsounds only too familiar as well.<br />\nLike government officials<br />\nprotesting their innocence when<br />\nthey get caught with their hands<br />\nin the cookie jar. Like<br />\nCongressional Committees set up<br />\nto study and prevent the<br />\nrepetition of events that have<br />\nbecome political scandals,<br />\ncommittees that produce an<br />\nendless stream of reports and<br />\nnew rules, which, in turn, stand<br />\nas testaments to their own<br />\nineffectiveness when scandals<br />\n<br />\nreoccur. Like Johnson<br />\nadministration officials saying<br />\nthey privately opposed the<br />\nVietnam War all along, even as<br />\nthey publicly defended it...and as<br />\nmany of us believed them.<br />\nWell, why should we care? We<br />\nshould care for two reasons.<br />\nFirst, because, despite the effort<br />\nto reduce the explanation for the<br />\naward to Ashraf to someone's<br />\nmistake, in fact this award<br />\ncannot be understood simply as<br />\nsomeone's mistake. And second,<br />\nwe should care because we can<br />\ndo something about it. This<br />\naward, although cruder than<br />\nmost, is fundamentally typical of<br />\none way the university awards<br />\nhonorary degrees. Not<br />\nunderstanding that, as we swing<br />\nbetween feelings of cynicism and<br />\noutrage, we initially expressed<br />\nthe sort of outrage at the award<br />\nthat is reminiscent of the outrage<br />\nat former President Nixon's<br />\ncrimes. The essence of the<br />\nreaction lies in the expression of<br />\n.well-deserved moral disgust<br />\ncombined with the reassuring<br />\naffirmation that such events are<br />\naberrations of well-deserved moral<br />\ndisgust combined with the<br />\nreassuring affirmation that such<br />\nevents are aberrations-- the result<br />\nof someone's \"mistake\" or<br />\nsomeone's peculiar personality.<br />\nReally? Under the circumstances<br />\noutrage is not enough.<br />\nUnderstanding, too, is demanded.<br />\nWe must understand that in<br />\nmany, basic ways, our university,<br />\nlike all major institutions, is a<br />\ncreature of the society in which<br />\nit exists. The award of honorary<br />\ndegrees, like other university<br />\nfunctions, is necessarily<br />\ncongruent with and reinforcing<br />\nof the nature of that society.<br />\nThus, we award honorary degrees<br />\non two primary bases: first, to<br />\nscientists and academics to honor<br />\ntheir achievements, thereby<br />\nreinforcing the values<br />\n<br />\nof individualism, competition,<br />\nelitism, and professionalism; and<br />\nsecond, to people, with money<br />\nand/or power and influence,<br />\nthereby ensuring to the<br />\nuniversity an implied or explicit,<br />\nappropriate past, present or<br />\nfuture quid pro quo.<br />\nThose, indeed, are the facts of<br />\nlife, and the award to Ashraf<br />\nmust be understood in this<br />\ncontext. The award ultimately is<br />\nnot a matter of mistakes or<br />\npersonalities, either her's or<br />\nuniversity officials'. If, on the<br />\none hand, Ashraf personally had<br />\n,been a saint in the imperial<br />\nIranian household--hard as it may<br />\nbe to imagine--that would not<br />\nhave changed the nature of the<br />\naward, because she was not given<br />\nthe degree in recognition of any<br />\npersonal qualities in the first<br />\nplace. Or if, on the other hand,<br />\nHopkins had had a different<br />\npresident or different provost<br />\nthat would not have made the<br />\nlikelihood of such awards<br />\nsubstantially less. Such awards'<br />\nare institutionally part of<br />\nAmerican universities as<br />\npresently constituted.<br />\nUniversities need money. They<br />\nneed influence. They \"sell\"<br />\nhonorary degrees, either crudely<br />\nor sophisticatedly, to get both.<br />\nBut then if it's all so<br />\n\"inevitable\" why bother to care?<br />\nIf the university is likely to<br />\nhonor \"oppressors\" of various<br />\nsorts--the careerists, and the<br />\nwealthy, .p,owerful and<br />\nfamous--rather than persons<br />\nwhose main goal in life is<br />\nimproving people's lives, again.<br />\nwhy all the furor? Why? Because<br />\nwe are partly responsible for<br />\nwhat happened, and because we<br />\ncan make a difference.<br />\nThe real \"mistake\" made in the<br />\naward to Ashraf, most of us can<br />\nsee now, was in the Hopkins'<br />\n<br />\nsee IRAN, page 9<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt appears that Joseph<br />\nAlbanese (Letters/April 13)seeks<br />\nadmission into the ranks of<br />\nprudes and boorish \"moralists\"<br />\nthat have plagued the history of<br />\nart for centuries.

It<br />\nwas your gutter-ridden psyche,<br />\nJoe, that interpreted the photo in<br />\nquestion as anything other than a<br />\ngraphic celebration of the female<br />\nform.<br />\nCraig Hankin<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn reference to Maurice<br />\nMathis' letter to the editor<br />\n(4/ 1 3/76), I do not believe that<br />\na ,arding an Honorary Degree to<br />\n<br />\n'Mother' Shayegan will cheapen<br />\nthe integrity or value of a Johns<br />\nHopkins degree. To the contrary,<br />\nI think such an award will set<br />\nJohns Hopkins apart from other<br />\ninstitutions by the fact that the<br />\naward will state emphatically<br />\nthat we are on the side of those<br />\nwho are oppressed in Iran, rather<br />\nthan on the side of those who are<br />\nprofiting from the exploitation<br />\nand suffering of human beings in<br />\nIran.<br />\nThe education one receives at<br />\nJohns Hopkins should not be<br />\nused in a political void. It is our<br />\nobligation to look at the<br />\nproblems we see in society and<br />\nseek a solution to those<br />\nproblems. I have no objection<br />\nthat the Administration tacitly<br />\nrecognizes a solution to the<br />\nproblems in Iran per se; my<br />\nobjection is that it is the wrong<br />\nsolution. Corrupt officials that<br />\nlive in splendor while the<br />\nmajority endure the harshest<br />\nforms of poverty imaginable is<br />\nnot the answer to a backwards<br />\ncountry attempting to<br />\nmodernize, anymore than it is<br />\n<br />\nthe solution in the Phillipines,<br />\nSouth Korea, Brazil, Chile, or<br />\nanywehere else in the 'free'<br />\nworld. The Senior Class, as<br />\nevidenced by their support of<br />\n'Mother' Shayegan, believes that<br />\nthe answers to Iran's problems<br />\nwill be found when we assist the<br />\noverwhelming majority of the<br />\npeople in their quest for the<br />\nhuman dignity and rights we take<br />\nfor granted.<br />\nSo if Mr. Mathis wishes to<br />\nexpress dissatisfaction over the<br />\noutcome of the vote taken by the<br />\nSenior Class, he or anyone else,<br />\nshould do so in political terms.<br />\nTake a stand on the issue--use the<br />\ntalents and knowledge you've<br />\ndeveloped through, your<br />\neducation--to put forth what you<br />\nsee as the solution. Anything<br />\nshort of taking such a stance will<br />\ncheapen awards given by this<br />\nUniversity, for it will mean that<br />\nwe are not actively seeking<br />\nsolutions, but are only passively<br />\naccepting the defects of the<br />\npresent state of affairs.<br />\nBill McNamara '76<br />\n<br />\nJ<br />\n<br />\n\fGPA<br />\n<br />\nThroat culture: come out, come out, you closet cases<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nGod must love throats, 'cause<br />\nhe made so many of them.--Old<br />\nHopkins adage.<br />\nTo paraphrase Voltaire, I may<br />\nnot be a throat, but I'll defend to<br />\ndeath your right to be one.<br />\nBefore proceeding any further<br />\nwith this apologia of the so-called<br />\n\"throat culture,\" let me first<br />\ndefine in rather brief terms what<br />\nis exactly meant by \"Throat,\"<br />\n\"Nerd,\" or what have you. By<br />\npopular consent, a throat seems<br />\nto be student completely<br />\nenthralled with academics to the<br />\npoint of fanaticism. Unlike other<br />\nminority groups, throats do not<br />\nall look alike. This beleaguered<br />\nminority has members of all ages<br />\nand sexes, in different sizes and<br />\nshapes. That foxy-looking chick<br />\nsitting so alluringly in Hutzler<br />\nmay well be a throat princess. Or<br />\nthat suave, debonair guy walking<br />\nso proudly with his books may<br />\nbe a jock on the playing fields of<br />\nthroatdom, a superstar among<br />\nnerds. Indeed the physical<br />\ndelineation between throats and<br />\nregular people\" is so faint as to<br />\nbe indistinguishable. This<br />\nimportant ethnographic fact<br />\nconfirms my worst suspiscions<br />\nabout Hopkins undergraduates;<br />\nthat is, there are many more<br />\nCloset throats than you may<br />\nthink.<br />\nOne can only look at the<br />\nridiculously high mean GPA and<br />\nsee irrefutable proof of this. A<br />\nstudent has to work damn hard<br />\nto get good marks here. I know<br />\nby experience; for two years now<br />\nI've been getting by academically<br />\njust on the strength of my<br />\ncollective wits. I'm one step<br />\nahead of that old demon<br />\nAcademic Probation, and just<br />\ntwo ahead of the ultimate<br />\ncatastrophe, Dismissal on<br />\nAcademic Grounds. Foregoing<br />\nthe typical modesty of the<br />\nmartyr sort, I can safely say I've<br />\ngiven more unselfishly of myself<br />\nin the past two years than in the<br />\nrest of my brief life. I don't write<br />\nfor the News-Letter for any<br />\n<br />\nmonetary reward; neither do I<br />\nplay varsity golf as preparation to<br />\nsomeday join the pro tour and<br />\nknock heads with Arnie and<br />\nJack. I engage in these<br />\nextracurricular activities because<br />\nI have this old-fashioned notion<br />\nthat a student must,in some way,<br />\ncontribute to his :school, instead<br />\nof just taking away, after four of<br />\n<br />\nthe most important years in a<br />\nlife, a molehill of knowledge, half<br />\nof which is basically useless<br />\noutside a bluebook.<br />\nEducation<br />\nEnough of this self-glorifying<br />\negomania. Seriously, education is<br />\nsomething more than a simple<br />\ntransaction of payment and<br />\nreception. Ideally, in Marxist<br />\n<br />\ncliches, education should<br />\ntranscend the decadence of the<br />\ncapitalistic society and become<br />\nmore of instruction of how to<br />\nlive, instead of how to make a<br />\nliving.

This<br />\nferocious breed of closet throats<br />\nis much easier to define in<br />\nstatistical terms. Born within a<br />\nhundred miles of New York, the<br />\ncloset throat lives in suburban<br />\nbourgeois comfort, protected by<br />\na moat of wealth from the harsh<br />\nfacts of how the majority<br />\nmanages to survive.

A<br />\nletter to the class, another free<br />\nbeer night, and lo, a \"Bull Roast\"<br />\non the second Saturday in April,<br />\nthe weekend before class<br />\nelections, and more. How to<br />\nexplain this abrupt resurgence of<br />\nleadership? Is it perhaps a<br />\nbeneficial effect of the Spring<br />\nweather, is it a ratification of the<br />\nancient Buchwaldism: \"Hell hath<br />\nno fury like a politician near<br />\nelection time.\" It is for you to<br />\ndecide.<br />\nBut, in closing, it strikes me<br />\n<br />\nthat I have neglected one of the<br />\nSpringtime accomplishments. I<br />\nhave before me what is perhaps<br />\nthe signal achievement of the<br />\nClass of I977\u2014a pre-professional<br />\nguide, or \"Get Your Rear in<br />\nGear.\" The tiny six-page<br />\npamphlet, like an outdated issue<br />\nof Time contains information<br />\nalready known or available<br />\nelsewhere.Among the items of<br />\nvital intelligence relayed are:<br />\n\u2014the fact that transcripts must<br />\nbe requested from the Registrar<br />\n\u2014that the Registrar's Office is<br />\nin Garland Hall<br />\n\u2014that all graduate schools<br />\nrequire transcripts<br />\n\u2014that students may begin<br />\npreparing grad school<br />\napplications during the summer.<br />\nNor does the clever pamphlet<br />\nhave the saving grace of<br />\neloquence. The prose, based on<br />\nthe Read's clock-radio warranty<br />\ngenre, rarely goes beyond the<br />\nlisting of i names, dates, and<br />\nphone extensions. In the present<br />\nelection -time climate, I can<br />\nunderstand why the class<br />\nleadership saw fit to formally<br />\napprise the public that medical<br />\nschool applicants must take<br />\nMCATS,and prospective lawyers,<br />\nLSATS. But I have trouble<br />\ninterpreting the drawing of a<br />\nHippopotamus that graces the<br />\nbooklet's cover.

They are likely to try to<br />\navoid the issue, to kill it before<br />\nmost of us are even aware of it,<br />\nor to delay answering. They are<br />\nlikely, in short, to do whatever is<br />\nnecessary to not have to give an<br />\nihonorary degree to Mother<br />\nShayegan. Several years ago<br />\nUniversity officials refused to<br />\nmake a similar award to a<br />\npolitical prisoner in the<br />\nVietnamese jails. There's a<br />\npattern to this that we have to<br />\ntry to break: the award to an<br />\n<br />\nAshraf or an Olin, accompanied<br />\nby the declaration that it is<br />\nnon-political and juxtaposed to<br />\nthe refusal to award a degree to a<br />\npolitical prisoner on the grounds<br />\nthat that would be political.<br />\nIn this particular case we are<br />\non very strong grounds. We're<br />\nasking Hopkins to take a clear,<br />\nofficial step to begin to<br />\ncompensate for the formal award<br />\nto Ashraf. Personal apologies and<br />\nprivate regrets are not the same.<br />\nNot that awarding an honorary<br />\ndegree to someone who had been<br />\na prisoner in a concentration<br />\ncamp in Nazi Germany, for<br />\nexample, would compensate for a<br />\nprior award to, say, Hitler's<br />\ngirlfriend, but at least it's a small<br />\nand necessary step.<br />\nAnd it's one to which you and<br />\nI can make some contributions<br />\nbefore the next Board of<br />\nTrustees' meeting on Monday,<br />\nApril 26.

The meet was one of<br />\nthe more exciting events this<br />\nseason as the team finished ten<br />\npoints behind the victor, Ursinus,<br />\nand only one point behind the<br />\nsecond place finisher from<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nThe meet was marked by<br />\nseveral outstanding<br />\nperformances, but the standout<br />\nof the day was Ursinus' Kevin<br />\nKalmbach. Kalmbach proved to<br />\nbe quite a competitor as he<br />\nfinished a quadruple winner<br />\ntaking the triple jump, the 220<br />\n<br />\nand 440-yard sprints, and was a seconds.<br />\nCaptain Mark Hylind, who has<br />\npart of a victorious mile relay<br />\none of the team's leading<br />\nbeen<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\nhigh<br />\nteam.

All decisions will be<br />\nfinalized next Wednesday afternoon at a<br />\ngeneral SAC meeting in the Great Hall at<br />\n5:00 P.M.<br />\nThe News-Letter's annual expenditures<br />\ntotal approximately $30,000. Eighty per<br />\ncent of that sum is obtained through<br />\nadvertising; the remainder has traditionally<br />\nbeen supplied by the SAC, the group which<br />\nfunds all Hopkins student organizations. In<br />\norder for the paper to survive financially,<br />\nthe $6,000 is essential.<br />\nThis is not the first ^time that the<br />\nNews-Letter has had difficulty in<br />\nbargaining for these funds. Last May, after<br />\nseveral heated arguments, the News-Letter<br />\nwas awarded $5500. In that case, the SAC<br />\nquestioned whether the paper should have<br />\nany paid employees. They insisted that no<br />\nstaff member, in any capacity, should be<br />\npaid for their efforts. They were sure that<br />\nmost people would continue to work<br />\nstripped of salary, out of their dedication<br />\nto the paper.<br />\nWe felt then, as we do now, that this<br />\nrationale is not only naive but invalid as<br />\nwell. First of all, very few staff members<br />\nare paid for their services. Those who do<br />\nget paid are involved in the technical aspect<br />\nof the News-Letter, the behind-the-scenes<br />\ndrudgery that is necessary to produce any<br />\nnewspaper. These paid staffers work on<br />\npaste-up, typing, distribution and similar<br />\ntasks. There is no glory in this kind of<br />\nwork, no by-lines or picture credits. And<br />\nnot everyone in this category is paid--we<br />\njust can't afford it.<br />\nFurthermore, the wages are nowhere<br />\nnear the king's ransom that the SAC feels<br />\nwe are handing out. A production assistant<br />\nis paid fifteen dollars an issue. Usually they<br />\nwork from ten in the evening until seven<br />\nthe next morning. Even with salaries, we<br />\nare short on help; if salaries are eliminated,<br />\nfew will toil for the News\u2014Letter. And<br />\njustifiably so.<br />\nUnlike most college papers, the<br />\nNews-Letter offers not a penny to its<br />\neditors. No one at the News\u2014letter is<br />\nrewarded with academic credit for his or<br />\nher work.<br />\nThis time around with the SAC,<br />\nhowever, there are other conflicts as well.<br />\nThe SAC executive committee is convinced<br />\nthe the News-Letter is shirking its<br />\nobligation to the student body because of<br />\nthe content of this year's paper. They say<br />\nthat the News-Letter should be primarily<br />\nan informative publication, one that deals<br /><br />\nmainly with student news. Ron Bialek has<br />\nsaid that \"the News-Letter's only<br />\naccomplishment this year has been to hurt<br />\nthe jHU undergraduates.\"<br />\nWhat they really mean to say is that the<br />\nNews-Letter has ceased to be merely a<br />\npublicity organ for the student government<br />\nand administration.<br />\nIn particular, the SAC executive<br />\ncommittee is displeased with the Friday<br />\neditions of the News- Letter claiming<br />\nthat a \"magazine-features\" format has no<br />\nplace on a college campus. They describe<br />\nthe paper as \"too literary and cavalier,\" or<br />\n\"filled with bullshit.\" They maintain that a<br />\nmajority of the student body is dissatisfied<br />\nwith the Friday News-Letter, suggested by<br />\nmythical stacks of leftover papers.<br />\nWell, these charges just aren't true. Not<br />\nonly has the News-Letter increased<br />\ncirculation this year, but by our estimates<br />\n-more people arc reading the News-Letter<br />\ntoday than at any time in its eighty year<br />\nhistory.<br />\nWe have received,unprecedented acclaim<br />\nfrom a broad mixture of students, faculty,<br />\nadministration, and community residents.<br />\nIt is clear to us that the News-Letter is<br />\nmore popular today than ever before. At<br />\nthe very least, the constituency of the<br />\nNews-Letter has changed. Last year's critics<br />\nare supporters, while our current detractors<br />\nare former friends of the paper. A<br />\nnewspaper never has unanimous approval.<br />\nWe have enough problems simply<br />\nproducing the paper without additional<br />\nburdens thrust upon us by the SAC. We<br />\nhave scores of critics, none of whom are<br />\nwilling to work at the News-Letter to help<br />\nenact their desired changes in policy.<br />\nBattles with the SAC only further drain an<br />\noverworked staff.<br />\nWe're proud of the work we've<br />\naccomplished this year at the News-Letter<br />\nand are confident that our readers will<br />\nexpress their support. We're also sure that<br />\nthe student body would much rather have<br />\nthe paper in its present form as opposed to<br />\nthe prospect of no paper at all.<br />\nWhat it comes down to is thiE: if the<br />\nNews-Letter's funds are withdrawn, there<br />\nwill be virtually<br />\nno student newspaper<br />\nhere next semester. The SAC may feel that<br />\nby withholding funds they can create a<br />\ncampus mouthpiece. But it seems to us that<br />\nwe're being victimized by a vocal minority<br />\nof student politicians.<br />\nWe will not compromise our 'policies to<br />\nconform with the SAC's narrow conception<br />\nof a school newspaper's purpose. It is our<br />\nresponsibility to produce the finest<br />\nnewspaper we can.

Business hours are Monday and Thursday afternoons.<br />\nThe staff motto is \"Will Reggie pay for us?\"<br /><br />\nlovely rita<br />\nWe witnessed an incredible example of University waste<br />\nand regimentation today, right in front of our very own<br />\nGatehouse. College maintenance men were doing repairs<br />\ndownstairs, and had parked their van out front in order to<br />\nhave easy access to equipment. Security received notice of<br />\nthe vehicle, and ordered it to be moved or towed. The<br />\nworkers, after explaining to no avail, didn't worry<br />\nanyway--the University was only fining itself!<br />\nThese absurd actions are repeated daily with students. The<br />\ncampus cops drive strictly by the book, spending great<br />\namounts of time to enforce every picayune Caligulan<br />\nregulation. Meanwhile, the students are pressured by the city,.<br />\nwhich doesn't want all those JHU-people cars cluttering<br />\nBaltimore streets when they should park on campus.<br />\nRobert Larkin, Head of Security, apparently doesn't see<br />\nthe needless and irritating squeeze he is putting on students<br />\nand campus departments. Various divisions of the University<br />\nfind themselves forced to share inadequate parking spaces<br />\nwith other groups, and watch as the cops issue them tickets<br />\n(not to mention park in their spaces).<br />\nThe Student Council,\u2022 true to form, has failed to act<br />\ndecisively on the matter. They have a representative on the<br />\ncommittee which establishes the campus parking regulations;<br />\ngranted, one voice is rather slight, butl that single person has<br />\nnot received the backing to say something effective.<br />\nThis parking policy reflects a general University<br />\nshort-sightedness .in local administration. Physically, the<br />\ncampus will always have a traffic problem. With students,<br />\nfaculty, and employees burdened by this overwrought<br />\nsystem, the University should wake up to realize that it's<br />\ntowing itself away.<br /><br />\nAnother voice<br /><br />\nWe have a responsibility here<br />\nBy RIC PFEFFER<br />\nHey, what's all the fuss about?<br />\nSo; we gave an honorary degree<br />\nto the Shah's sister. So,<br />\neverybody knows she got it<br />\nbecause she is the sister of the<br />\nShah and because the Shah is<br />\nvery rich and very powerful, so<br />\nwhat. That's the way life is, and<br />\nanyway the issue is no longer<br />\nentertaining.<br />\nSo what if she's ,a dope<br />\npeddler, so what if she's a major<br />\nrepresentative and figurehead in a<br />\nregime universally recognized to<br />\nbe the most repressive in the<br />\nworld --and that's saying<br />\nsomething!<br />\nAnd after all, hasn't the<br />\npresident of Hopkins more-or-less<br />\napologized and more-or-less<br />\nadmitted he made a mistake?<br />\nHasn't the provost, who<br />\npersonally presented the award<br />\nto Princess Ashraf, been telling<br />\nfaculty members privately that<br />\nhe opposed the award all along?<br />\nAnd hasn't President Muller<br />\nindicated he wants a<br />\nuniversity-wide committee to<br />\nestablish some procedures for<br />\nawarding honorary degrees to<br />\nsafeguard in the future against<br />\nthe kind of \"mistakes\" in<br />\nhonoring the dishonorable that<br />\nthe award to Ashraf represents?<br />\nGee, it all sounds so good.<br />\nHumility in high places, concern<br />\nthat \"errors\" not be repeated. Of<br />\ncourse, on the other hand, it also<br />\nsounds only too familiar as well.<br />\nLike government officials<br />\nprotesting their innocence when<br />\nthey get caught with their hands<br />\nin the cookie jar. Like<br />\nCongressional Committees set up<br />\nto study and prevent the<br />\nrepetition of events that have<br />\nbecome political scandals,<br />\ncommittees that produce an<br />\nendless stream of reports and<br />\nnew rules, which, in turn, stand<br />\nas testaments to their own<br />\nineffectiveness when scandals<br /><br />\nreoccur. Like Johnson<br />\nadministration officials saying<br />\nthey privately opposed the<br />\nVietnam War all along, even as<br />\nthey publicly defended it...and as<br />\nmany of us believed them.<br />\nWell, why should we care? We<br />\nshould care for two reasons.<br />\nFirst, because, despite the effort<br />\nto reduce the explanation for the<br />\naward to Ashraf to someone's<br />\nmistake, in fact this award<br />\ncannot be understood simply as<br />\nsomeone's mistake. And second,<br />\nwe should care because we can<br />\ndo something about it. This<br />\naward, although cruder than<br />\nmost, is fundamentally typical of<br />\none way the university awards<br />\nhonorary degrees. Not<br />\nunderstanding that, as we swing<br />\nbetween feelings of cynicism and<br />\noutrage, we initially expressed<br />\nthe sort of outrage at the award<br />\nthat is reminiscent of the outrage<br />\nat former President Nixon's<br />\ncrimes. The essence of the<br />\nreaction lies in the expression of<br />\n.well-deserved moral disgust<br />\ncombined with the reassuring<br />\naffirmation that such events are<br />\naberrations of well-deserved moral<br />\ndisgust combined with the<br />\nreassuring affirmation that such<br />\nevents are aberrations-- the result<br />\nof someone's \"mistake\" or<br />\nsomeone's peculiar personality.<br />\nReally? Under the circumstances<br />\noutrage is not enough.<br />\nUnderstanding, too, is demanded.<br />\nWe must understand that in<br />\nmany, basic ways, our university,<br />\nlike all major institutions, is a<br />\ncreature of the society in which<br />\nit exists. The award of honorary<br />\ndegrees, like other university<br />\nfunctions, is necessarily<br />\ncongruent with and reinforcing<br />\nof the nature of that society.<br />\nThus, we award honorary degrees<br />\non two primary bases: first, to<br />\nscientists and academics to honor<br />\ntheir achievements, thereby<br />\nreinforcing the values<br /><br />\nof individualism, competition,<br />\nelitism, and professionalism; and<br />\nsecond, to people, with money<br />\nand/or power and influence,<br />\nthereby ensuring to the<br />\nuniversity an implied or explicit,<br />\nappropriate past, present or<br />\nfuture quid pro quo.<br />\nThose, indeed, are the facts of<br />\nlife, and the award to Ashraf<br />\nmust be understood in this<br />\ncontext. The award ultimately is<br />\nnot a matter of mistakes or<br />\npersonalities, either her's or<br />\nuniversity officials'. If, on the<br />\none hand, Ashraf personally had<br />\n,been a saint in the imperial<br />\nIranian household--hard as it may<br />\nbe to imagine--that would not<br />\nhave changed the nature of the<br />\naward, because she was not given<br />\nthe degree in recognition of any<br />\npersonal qualities in the first<br />\nplace. Or if, on the other hand,<br />\nHopkins had had a different<br />\npresident or different provost<br />\nthat would not have made the<br />\nlikelihood of such awards<br />\nsubstantially less. Such awards'<br />\nare institutionally part of<br />\nAmerican universities as<br />\npresently constituted.<br />\nUniversities need money. They<br />\nneed influence. They \"sell\"<br />\nhonorary degrees, either crudely<br />\nor sophisticatedly, to get both.<br />\nBut then if it's all so<br />\n\"inevitable\" why bother to care?<br />\nIf the university is likely to<br />\nhonor \"oppressors\" of various<br />\nsorts--the careerists, and the<br />\nwealthy, .p,owerful and<br />\nfamous--rather than persons<br />\nwhose main goal in life is<br />\nimproving people's lives, again.<br />\nwhy all the furor? Why? Because<br />\nwe are partly responsible for<br />\nwhat happened, and because we<br />\ncan make a difference.<br />\nThe real \"mistake\" made in the<br />\naward to Ashraf, most of us can<br />\nsee now, was in the Hopkins'<br /><br />\nsee IRAN, page 9<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt appears that Joseph<br />\nAlbanese (Letters/April 13)seeks<br />\nadmission into the ranks of<br />\nprudes and boorish \"moralists\"<br />\nthat have plagued the history of<br />\nart for centuries. A straight line<br />\ncan be drawn from the papist<br />\npinheads of the Counter<br />\nReformation who demanded that<br />\nloincloths<br />\nbe painted over<br />\nMichelangelo's Last Judgement<br />\nfrescoes to the Victorian fops<br />\nwho were so scandalized by<br />\nManet's Luncheon on the/Grass<br />\nand now to Albanese's protests<br />\nof \"plummeting sexual standars\"<br />\nas evidenced by David Porter's<br />\ncover photograph of April 19. It<br />\nwas your gutter-ridden psyche,<br />\nJoe, that interpreted the photo in<br />\nquestion as anything other than a<br />\ngraphic celebration of the female<br />\nform.<br />\nCraig Hankin<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIn reference to Maurice<br />\nMathis' letter to the editor<br />\n(4/ 1 3/76), I do not believe that<br />\na ,arding an Honorary Degree to<br /><br />\n'Mother' Shayegan will cheapen<br />\nthe integrity or value of a Johns<br />\nHopkins degree. To the contrary,<br />\nI think such an award will set<br />\nJohns Hopkins apart from other<br />\ninstitutions by the fact that the<br />\naward will state emphatically<br />\nthat we are on the side of those<br />\nwho are oppressed in Iran, rather<br />\nthan on the side of those who are<br />\nprofiting from the exploitation<br />\nand suffering of human beings in<br />\nIran.<br />\nThe education one receives at<br />\nJohns Hopkins should not be<br />\nused in a political void. It is our<br />\nobligation to look at the<br />\nproblems we see in society and<br />\nseek a solution to those<br />\nproblems. I have no objection<br />\nthat the Administration tacitly<br />\nrecognizes a solution to the<br />\nproblems in Iran per se; my<br />\nobjection is that it is the wrong<br />\nsolution. Corrupt officials that<br />\nlive in splendor while the<br />\nmajority endure the harshest<br />\nforms of poverty imaginable is<br />\nnot the answer to a backwards<br />\ncountry attempting to<br />\nmodernize, anymore than it is<br /><br />\nthe solution in the Phillipines,<br />\nSouth Korea, Brazil, Chile, or<br />\nanywehere else in the 'free'<br />\nworld. The Senior Class, as<br />\nevidenced by their support of<br />\n'Mother' Shayegan, believes that<br />\nthe answers to Iran's problems<br />\nwill be found when we assist the<br />\noverwhelming majority of the<br />\npeople in their quest for the<br />\nhuman dignity and rights we take<br />\nfor granted.<br />\nSo if Mr. Mathis wishes to<br />\nexpress dissatisfaction over the<br />\noutcome of the vote taken by the<br />\nSenior Class, he or anyone else,<br />\nshould do so in political terms.<br />\nTake a stand on the issue--use the<br />\ntalents and knowledge you've<br />\ndeveloped through, your<br />\neducation--to put forth what you<br />\nsee as the solution. Anything<br />\nshort of taking such a stance will<br />\ncheapen awards given by this<br />\nUniversity, for it will mean that<br />\nwe are not actively seeking<br />\nsolutions, but are only passively<br />\naccepting the defects of the<br />\npresent state of affairs.<br />\nBill McNamara '76<br /><br />\nJ<br /><br />\nGPA<br /><br />\nThroat culture: come out, come out, you closet cases<br />\nBy MIKE DEAK<br />\nGod must love throats, 'cause<br />\nhe made so many of them.--Old<br />\nHopkins adage.<br />\nTo paraphrase Voltaire, I may<br />\nnot be a throat, but I'll defend to<br />\ndeath your right to be one.<br />\nBefore proceeding any further<br />\nwith this apologia of the so-called<br />\n\"throat culture,\" let me first<br />\ndefine in rather brief terms what<br />\nis exactly meant by \"Throat,\"<br />\n\"Nerd,\" or what have you. By<br />\npopular consent, a throat seems<br />\nto be student completely<br />\nenthralled with academics to the<br />\npoint of fanaticism. Unlike other<br />\nminority groups, throats do not<br />\nall look alike. This beleaguered<br />\nminority has members of all ages<br />\nand sexes, in different sizes and<br />\nshapes. That foxy-looking chick<br />\nsitting so alluringly in Hutzler<br />\nmay well be a throat princess. Or<br />\nthat suave, debonair guy walking<br />\nso proudly with his books may<br />\nbe a jock on the playing fields of<br />\nthroatdom, a superstar among<br />\nnerds. Indeed the physical<br />\ndelineation between throats and<br />\nregular people\" is so faint as to<br />\nbe indistinguishable. This<br />\nimportant ethnographic fact<br />\nconfirms my worst suspiscions<br />\nabout Hopkins undergraduates;<br />\nthat is, there are many more<br />\nCloset throats than you may<br />\nthink.<br />\nOne can only look at the<br />\nridiculously high mean GPA and<br />\nsee irrefutable proof of this. A<br />\nstudent has to work damn hard<br />\nto get good marks here. I know<br />\nby experience; for two years now<br />\nI've been getting by academically<br />\njust on the strength of my<br />\ncollective wits. I'm one step<br />\nahead of that old demon<br />\nAcademic Probation, and just<br />\ntwo ahead of the ultimate<br />\ncatastrophe, Dismissal on<br />\nAcademic Grounds. Foregoing<br />\nthe typical modesty of the<br />\nmartyr sort, I can safely say I've<br />\ngiven more unselfishly of myself<br />\nin the past two years than in the<br />\nrest of my brief life. I don't write<br />\nfor the News-Letter for any<br /><br />\nmonetary reward; neither do I<br />\nplay varsity golf as preparation to<br />\nsomeday join the pro tour and<br />\nknock heads with Arnie and<br />\nJack. I engage in these<br />\nextracurricular activities because<br />\nI have this old-fashioned notion<br />\nthat a student must,in some way,<br />\ncontribute to his :school, instead<br />\nof just taking away, after four of<br /><br />\nthe most important years in a<br />\nlife, a molehill of knowledge, half<br />\nof which is basically useless<br />\noutside a bluebook.<br />\nEducation<br />\nEnough of this self-glorifying<br />\negomania. Seriously, education is<br />\nsomething more than a simple<br />\ntransaction of payment and<br />\nreception. Ideally, in Marxist<br /><br />\ncliches, education should<br />\ntranscend the decadence of the<br />\ncapitalistic society and become<br />\nmore of instruction of how to<br />\nlive, instead of how to make a<br />\nliving.

Throats, I<br />\nunabashedly admit, are my<br />\nequals and I have nothing against<br />\nthem, save for some ideological<br />\nconflicts I will shortly discuss.<br />\nHowever, I do have much<br />\nagainst those who look down on<br />\nthroats as the dregs of the earth.<br />\nDuring my freshman year, I had a<br />\nfirst-floor room bordering right<br />\non the quad. Every other night, it<br />\nseemed, while I was watching<br />\nJohnny Carson, some fool would<br />\nyell, \"All right you fucking<br />\nthroats! Time for Bed!\" Many<br />\ntimes my benevolent roommate<br />\nwould physically restrain me<br />\nfrom leaping out into the quad<br />\nand personally smashing that<br />\nbarbarian's thick skull against the<br />\ncold, hard pavement. But my<br />\ntaste for the melodramatic has<br />\ndiminished and I'm content now<br />\nto be restrained and subtle in my<br />\noutbursts against these insensitive<br />\ntykes.<br />\nOften the closet throat will<br />\npersecute the lowly nerd just to<br />\nhide his own disability. This<br />\nferocious breed of closet throats<br />\nis much easier to define in<br />\nstatistical terms. Born within a<br />\nhundred miles of New York, the<br />\ncloset throat lives in suburban<br />\nbourgeois comfort, protected by<br />\na moat of wealth from the harsh<br />\nfacts of how the majority<br />\nmanages to survive. Pushed<br />\nthrough modern high schools<br />\nwith liberal open arms and<br />\nadvanced placement courses, the<br />\ncloset throat's pre-college<br />\neducation has been directed<br />\ntowards one goal\u2014acceptance<br />\ninto one of the country's best<br />\nschools. They live under the<br />\ndelusion that attending one of<br />\nthese top-notch schools is a<br />\npassport to big bucks later on in<br />\nlife. Their whole life is geared to<br />\nmaking money, I'm convinced,<br />\nand not to helping humanity in<br />\nany way.<br />\nIn all my contacts around<br />\ncampus, I've yet to meet a throat<br />\nthat wasn't self-centered and<br />\ngreedy. It's not precisely thier<br />\nfault; they've been raised in a<br />\nsociety that condones throating<br />\nas a respectable way of life.<br />\nThroughout society competition<br />\nis so fierce and worshipped it<br />\ncan't help but rub off on those<br />\nyearning for success. Unfortunate<br />\nas it may be, it's a dog-eat-dog<br />\nworld out there and Hopkins is<br />\nnothing more than a microcosm<br />\nof upper middle class society.<br />\nExcuse these ramblings. They<br />\nare the words of a student tired<br />\nand disgusted with the American<br />\nway of education. I've already<br />\nbooked passage on a steamer<br />\nfor Rio on May 25, 1978, the<br />\nday after I receive my Hopkins<br />\nsheepskin.

Where was<br />\nour fearless leader, Mr.<br />\nHimelfarb, our paragon of<br />\nindustry, who while campaigning<br />\nfor re-election has the audacity<br />\nto adopt the slogan: \"Actions<br />\nspeak louder than words\"?<br />\nThough dynamic leadership was<br />\nfound nowhere in student<br />\ngovernment this year, the senior<br />\nclass at least had a weekly film<br />\nseries, selected with greater<br />\noriginality and taste than its two<br />\nrivals. The sophomore class<br />\nofficers sponsored some<br />\nauthentic class activities, helped<br />\nextend the hours of the Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop, and sent some<br />\nliterate communication to their<br />\nconstituents. But what of Mr.<br />\nHimelfarb? Where, of where, our<br />\nOdysseus?<br />\nWhere indeed. In the seventh<br />\nmonth of its tenure, the junior<br />\nclass leadership suddenly and<br />\nunaccountably barraged its<br />\nconstituency with attention. A<br />\nletter to the class, another free<br />\nbeer night, and lo, a \"Bull Roast\"<br />\non the second Saturday in April,<br />\nthe weekend before class<br />\nelections, and more. How to<br />\nexplain this abrupt resurgence of<br />\nleadership? Is it perhaps a<br />\nbeneficial effect of the Spring<br />\nweather, is it a ratification of the<br />\nancient Buchwaldism: \"Hell hath<br />\nno fury like a politician near<br />\nelection time.\" It is for you to<br />\ndecide.<br />\nBut, in closing, it strikes me<br /><br />\nthat I have neglected one of the<br />\nSpringtime accomplishments. I<br />\nhave before me what is perhaps<br />\nthe signal achievement of the<br />\nClass of I977\u2014a pre-professional<br />\nguide, or \"Get Your Rear in<br />\nGear.\" The tiny six-page<br />\npamphlet, like an outdated issue<br />\nof Time contains information<br />\nalready known or available<br />\nelsewhere.Among the items of<br />\nvital intelligence relayed are:<br />\n\u2014the fact that transcripts must<br />\nbe requested from the Registrar<br />\n\u2014that the Registrar's Office is<br />\nin Garland Hall<br />\n\u2014that all graduate schools<br />\nrequire transcripts<br />\n\u2014that students may begin<br />\npreparing grad school<br />\napplications during the summer.<br />\nNor does the clever pamphlet<br />\nhave the saving grace of<br />\neloquence. The prose, based on<br />\nthe Read's clock-radio warranty<br />\ngenre, rarely goes beyond the<br />\nlisting of i names, dates, and<br />\nphone extensions. In the present<br />\nelection -time climate, I can<br />\nunderstand why the class<br />\nleadership saw fit to formally<br />\napprise the public that medical<br />\nschool applicants must take<br />\nMCATS,and prospective lawyers,<br />\nLSATS. But I have trouble<br />\ninterpreting the drawing of a<br />\nHippopotamus that graces the<br />\nbooklet's cover. Perhaps the<br />\nofficers are demonstrating their<br />\naffection for all creatures large<br />\nand small, rich or poor. More<br />\nlikely it is a sign that this<br />\nwallowing, indolent, slow-moving<br />\nanimal isione in whose presence<br />\nour student leaders_ feel quite<br />\ncomfortable.<br /><br />\nwe can stay vigilant we can make a difference...'<br />\ndemonstrators, we would have<br />\nIRAN, from page 6<br />\nremained unconscious.

By becoming conscious<br />\nand remaining conscious, we can<br />\nhelp to make it too costly to<br />\ndishonor Hopkins and all of us<br />\nconnected with it in the daily<br />\nscramble for money and power.<br />\nAnd as we help ourselves and the<br />\nUniversity, we help University<br />\nofficials, whether tliey appreciate<br />\nit our not.<br />\nAnd we can still do more.'We<br />\ncan encourage, even pressure the<br />\nUniversity to honor itself and the<br />\nrest of us with truly honorable<br />\nhonorary degrees. We can<br />\nsupport the award of honorary<br />\ndegrees to people around the<br />\nworld who fight for freedom, to<br />\npeople who fight for equality, to<br />\npeople who have made sacrifices<br />\nto serve their fellow human<br />\nbeings.<br />\nThese are not, for the most<br />\npart, the big names in American<br />\npolitics, or the big names in<br />\nAmerican business, or the big<br />\nnames in American academia, or<br />\neven the big names in the<br />\nAmerican press. These are, for<br />\nthe most part, people who do not<br />\n\"make it\" in our establishment<br />\nor in foreign establishments,<br /><br />\nbecause these are people who<br />\ncare about their fellow human<br />\nbeings, which is the sort of<br />\ncommitment that only<br />\ninfrequently leads to personal<br />\nsuccess as we usually understand<br />\nit. These are not people who can<br />\ngive Hopkins money or a piece of<br />\nthe action. All they can do for us<br />\nis to bring us honor as we honor<br />\nthem.<br />\nSpecifically, in the case of<br />\nHopkins and Iran, we can begin<br />\nto make this difference now. We<br />\ncan support the recently voted<br />\nrequest of the class of 1976 to<br />\nPresident Muller and the Board<br />\nof Trustees to award an honorary<br />\ndegree at this spring's<br />\ncommencement to an Iranian<br />\npolitical prisoner, \"Mother<br />\nShayegan,\" who in her country<br />\nsymbolizes the struggle of the<br />\nIranian people for human rights.<br />\nGetting University officials to<br />\nmake such an award won't be<br />\neasy. They are likely to try to<br />\navoid the issue, to kill it before<br />\nmost of us are even aware of it,<br />\nor to delay answering. They are<br />\nlikely, in short, to do whatever is<br />\nnecessary to not have to give an<br />\nihonorary degree to Mother<br />\nShayegan. Several years ago<br />\nUniversity officials refused to<br />\nmake a similar award to a<br />\npolitical prisoner in the<br />\nVietnamese jails. There's a<br />\npattern to this that we have to<br />\ntry to break: the award to an<br /><br />\nAshraf or an Olin, accompanied<br />\nby the declaration that it is<br />\nnon-political and juxtaposed to<br />\nthe refusal to award a degree to a<br />\npolitical prisoner on the grounds<br />\nthat that would be political.<br />\nIn this particular case we are<br />\non very strong grounds. We're<br />\nasking Hopkins to take a clear,<br />\nofficial step to begin to<br />\ncompensate for the formal award<br />\nto Ashraf. Personal apologies and<br />\nprivate regrets are not the same.<br />\nNot that awarding an honorary<br />\ndegree to someone who had been<br />\na prisoner in a concentration<br />\ncamp in Nazi Germany, for<br />\nexample, would compensate for a<br />\nprior award to, say, Hitler's<br />\ngirlfriend, but at least it's a small<br />\nand necessary step.<br />\nAnd it's one to which you and<br />\nI can make some contributions<br />\nbefore the next Board of<br />\nTrustees' meeting on Monday,<br />\nApril 26. It is a contribution, I've<br />\nbeen trying to say, we owe--yes,<br />\nwe owe--to the people who stand<br />\nup and fight for justice. We owe<br />\nit to them. And we owe it to<br />\nourselves.
