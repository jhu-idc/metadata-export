Rasmussen<br />\nhelped institute the office at the<br />\nbeginning of the last academic<br />\nyear. In this interview, he talked<br />\nabout his role as an assistant to<br />\nBenton, problems he sees on<br />\ncampus, and what will be<br />\nprominent issues In Academic<br />\nServices this year.<br />\nNews-Letter: What exactly do<br />\nyou do as Student Assistant to<br />\nDr. George Benton, Homewood<br />\nVice President?<br />\nEric Rasmussen: Basically I try<br />\nto relay any concerns of the<br />\nundergraduates within Benton's<br />\nservices to Dr. Benton.<br />\nN-L: Why can't students relay<br />\nthose concerns to Benton personally?<br />\nRasmussen: In part they can.<br />\nLast year I tried to make that<br />\npossible with open office hours.<br />\nI'd be willing to bet no more<br />\nthan 25 students came. Part of<br />\nmy job is to relay problems that I<br />\nsee and bring them into the open.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that more<br />\nstudents had things to discuss<br />\nwith Dr. Benton last year than<br />\ncame to see him. In other words,<br />\n\"Looking For<br />\na Roommate?\"<br />\n<br />\nis there a need for a position to<br />\nlink students to Benton?<br />\nRasmussen: There is a need.<br />\nBenton makes decisions that<br />\naffects students. For example,<br />\nhe's the boss over the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office. In the event that<br />\nanything happens to one of the<br />\noffices he's in charge of, a<br />\nstudent is there to relay the<br />\nconcerns of the undergraduates.<br />\nHalf the job is sniffing out what<br />\nyou think is wrong. For example,<br />\nthe admissions office last year.<br />\nNot too many people understood<br />\nthat issue.<br />\nN-L: How much genuine<br />\ninfluence do you think you have<br />\nwith respect to Dr. Benton's<br />\ndecisions?<br />\nRasmussen: Not a hell of alot.<br />\nI think he respects my opinion. If<br />\nthere are issues that demand<br />\nimmediate attention, I'll go in<br />\nand talk to him, and ask him why<br />\nhe took a particular course of<br />\naction. I'll relay to him my<br />\nconcerns, and try to convince<br />\nhim of my position. But I don't<br />\nthink he'd call me in and sit me<br />\ndown before he would make any<br />\nmajor decision and ask for my<br />\nopinion.<br />\nN-L: What concrete things can<br />\nyou point to as your<br />\naccomplishments as Student<br />\nAssistant?<br />\nRasmussen: I don't think I<br />\n<br />\ncould cite anything concrete. But<br />\nI did help form the Student<br />\nBudget Advisory Committee,<br />\ninvestigated the admissions office<br />\nlast year, opened up office hours<br />\nfor Benton. This year I'm looking<br />\ninto the Dean of Students Office.<br />\nI think these things are concrete<br />\nin that they fulfill what I want to<br />\ndo over there. They point out<br />\nsituations that are unfair or<br />\noperate against student interests.<br />\nN-L: What are you looking<br />\ninto in the Dean of Seudents<br />\noffice?<br />\nRasmussen: There are three<br />\nthings that I'd like to look at this<br />\nyear: the proposal for merit<br />\nscholarships, the Union cost<br />\noverrun and simply the fact that<br />\nthe Dean of Students Office staff<br />\nhas doubled this year.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything in<br />\nparticular you'd like to see done?<br />\nRasmussen: I'd like to find<br />\nout, for instance, why a woman<br />\nwith Mrs. LaPointe's experience<br />\nand affection for students hasn't<br />\nbeen utilized to her fullest<br />\nextent. Meanwhile they've made<br />\nelaborate accomodations for<br />\nother employees.<br />\nN-L: Do many students come<br />\nto you with problems? If so, how<br />\nmany, and what kind of<br />\nproblems do they bring?<br />\nRasmussen: Not too many<br />\ncome. In fact, I probably go to<br />\n<br />\nsee more students than students<br />\ncome to see me. Those who do<br />\ncome and talk to me about<br />\ncurrent issues. If I can't help<br />\nthem, I refer them to Benton, or<br />\nthe right man in that area. I<br />\nimagine I'll have alot of people<br />\nseeing me about merit<br />\nscholarships as publicity grows.<br />\nN-L: How great a time<br />\ninvestment does your position<br />\nentail?<br />\nRasmussen: I'd say 10-15<br />\nhours a week.<br />\nN-L: Do you receive a salary?<br />\nRasmussen: Yes.<br />\nN-L: How much?<br />\nRasmussen: I better not say<br />\nhow much, but it's minimum<br />\nwage.<br />\nN-L: Is there any conflict of<br />\ninterest?<br />\nRasmussen: When I pick up<br />\nmy check, I don't view the<br />\nmoney I'm getting as coming<br />\nfrom the office of the Vice<br />\nPresident. I don't represent that<br />\noffice's interests. I represent the<br />\nstudents but more important,<br />\nwhat I think is right.<br />\nN-L: What are your thoughts<br />\non the reorganization plan in<br />\nAcademic Services that's gone on<br />\nover the last two years?<br />\nRasmussen: I think it's<br />\nexcellent. It centralizes this<br />\noffice around a single<br />\nadministrator. Previously, it was<br />\n<br />\na series, of offices unconnected.<br />\nThey're now related to one<br />\nanother through a_ single<br />\nadministrator\u2014Larry Denton. It's<br />\ninfinitely better for students who<br />\nhave a particular problem. Larry<br />\nis on the same level with the<br />\nDean of Students. He's much<br />\nmore accessible than Benton.<br />\nN-L: From your viewpoint, is<br />\nthere a cumbersome<br />\nadministrative bureaucracy here?<br />\nRasmussen: I don't think it's<br />\nas difficult to transcend as many<br />\n.others because it's a lot smaller.<br />\nThey operate bureaucratically,<br />\nbut that may be the way they<br />\nhave to operate.<br />\nN-L: Before you graduate this<br />\nJune, what is the one thing you'd<br />\nlike to see accomplished?<br />\nRasmussen: I want to see three<br />\nthings. A re-evaluation of the<br />\nDean of Students Office,<br />\nicnreased financial aid, especially<br />\nin line with tuition increases, and<br />\nthat certain student services<br />\npersonnel, who are currently<br />\nbeing abused and ignored, are<br />\ngiven their due.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything else<br />\nyou'd like to add?<br />\nRasmussen: I think my job can<br />\nbe perpetuated. I would like to<br />\nsee more involvement with the<br />\nStudent Council, but I'd also like<br />\nto see the Student Assistant given<br />\nthe flexibility that I have.<br />\n<br />\n\"The<br />\nRoommate<br />\nConnection\"<br />\nis a referral service agency.<br />\nClients have the option of<br />\naccepting or rejecting prospective<br />\nroommates.<br />\n<br />\n\"The<br />\nRoommate<br />\nConnection\"<br />\nhas up to date listings available.<br />\nThe foe Is reasonable<br />\nIA the see-vice Is<br />\n<br />\noccurato.<br />\n<br />\nCall us Tues.<br />\nThurs.or Sat.<br />\n10 A.M.-7 P.M.<br />\n3234220<br />\n<br />\nThere is a<br />\ndifferenceN<br />\nPREPARATION<br />\nMW<br />\nBAT<br />\n1111<br />\nCIE<br />\nATCSB<br />\nOCAT<br />\nCMI<br />\nFLEX<br />\nECIFFAC<br />\nNATI WO BUS<br />\nOver 35 years<br />\nof experience<br />\nand success\u2022<br />\nSmall classes<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nVoluminous home<br />\nstudy materials<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\nCourses that are<br />\nconstantly updated<br />\n\u2022<br />\nMake-ups for<br />\nmissed lessons<br />\n<br />\nFor complete information call:<br />\n<br />\n(301) 530-0211<br />\n<br />\nBe good to your stomach.

Srygley.<br />\nInterview conducted by Russ Smith.<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nome clean<br />\nIt is time for University officials to come clean<br />\nwith<br />\nre:pect to cost overruns in the contracting and<br />\nconstruction<br />\nof the new Hopkins Union. Though a substantial<br />\noverrun has<br />\nbeen covertly acknowledged by Hopkins<br />\nadministrators in off<br />\nthie record confessions, Homewood Vice President<br />\nGeorge<br />\nBe:nton and William Campbell,<br />\nDirector of Plant<br />\nMainagement, have contrived to hide the printed figures<br />\nfrom<br />\nth( public.<br />\nThe run-around game Benton and Campbell have used is a<br />\nchildish and unproductive one. Students, faculty, and<br />\nall<br />\nme mbers of the Hopkins community are entitled to know<br />\nthe<br />\nspecifics about the price of Homewood's newest<br />\nbuilding,<br />\nancI about any errors which may have gone into its<br />\nconstri<br />\nt is apparent that those officials associated with the<br />\nconstrliction of the Union chose to do things in an<br />\nexpensive<br />\nwa)<br />\n(, with little regard for economy or the elegance of simplic ity. It is also plain that some have gotten fat on<br />\nthe<br />\nconstruction of the Union in both the design and construiction phases.<br />\nt seems inconsistent and suspicious of University officials<br />\nto vithhold the specifics of the cost overrun in these times of<br />\ntigh t budgets, inasmuch as people usually do not hide<br />\nthings<br />\nunit ss there is something to be hidden.<br />\n<br />\n\"Historically its been the case that<br />\nthe whole humanities operation<br />\nhas been the tail on the dog, but.<br />\nit's also been the case that it's been<br />\na distinguished tail, and while it<br />\nhasn't exactly wagged the dog, it's<br />\nhardly been a mere appendage.<br />\nYou know as well as I that from<br />\nthe beginning of the Homewood<br />\noperation, there's been<br />\ndistinguished scholars on the<br />\nfaculty. The university's<br />\nconception of itself in the<br />\nhumanities has been, I take it, to<br />\nremain very small,, but very<br />\ndistinguished. Our modest<br />\nambition in the Writing Seminars is<br />\nvery quickly to become the most<br />\ndistinguished operations of its kind<br />\nin the country...\"<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\n10/17/74<br />\nThis year, it seems, will be<br />\nmarked by more distinctive<br />\nchanges and transition than most<br />\nin recent memory. It would<br />\nprobably be safe to say that more<br />\nsuperficially solid governments<br />\nhave fallen or undergone<br />\nhierarchical facelifting in this year<br />\nthan in any yeat since World War<br />\nII. No longer do we read post<br />\nmortems on the late sixties and<br />\nsigh, wondering what new causes<br />\nthere are to take up, what new<br />\nmovements are in the offing. The<br />\nworld passes, a virtual maelstrom,<br />\nand we, holding tightly to our<br />\ncopies of Homer and Kant,<br />\n.forestay the day when we too will<br />\nhave to dip our heads over the cleft<br />\nto view that disheartening,<br />\nvertiginous swirl of things that<br />\nawaits us. Such is the crux of<br />\nthings. There will be no more<br />\nmovements to swell and catch us<br />\nby surprise, where we may drift in<br />\nprotest and \"unified anger.\"<br />\ninstead, there is something<br />\nintensely more terrifying about<br />\ntrying to touch our feet on the<br />\nbottom of this stream, to grab<br />\nhold, and to be a rock. That's why<br />\nwe're here, not to be \"educated\"<br />\nbecause it is virtually impossible to<br />\nteach anyone anything. The idea is<br />\nto learn how to learn.<br />\nTheoretically. this leaminc, nrorecs<br />\n<br />\nist of thousands<br />\n<br />\nCZ<br />\n<br />\nEric Rasmussen's assertions in his interview [page 4] that<br />\nthere are certain situations in the Dean of Students Office<br />\nthat need examination are right on target. The Office was<br />\nformed not more than three years ago. Since then, the Office<br />\nhas had tremendous success in<br />\nachieving what it set out to<br />\ndo\u2014improve student services.<br />\nBut we wonder why now, when the initial load of the<br />\nimprovements have been made, it has been necessary to<br />\ndouble the Dean of Students' staff. The Dean has an<br />\nAssistant Dean, an Executive Assistant, and a secretary to aid<br />\nhim directly. Not even the academic deans have so thorough<br />\na complement of assistant workers.<br />\nAs the Hopkins Union finally gets underway and moves<br />\ninto full swing, it seems as if now is the time for an<br />\nevaluation of the Dean of Students Office. Is it fulfilling the<br />\nneeds of the community as well as it did in its first years? Is<br />\nit run effectively?<br />\nThese are questions that should be<br />\nscrutinized, so that the Dean of Students Office can continue<br />\nto improve the non-academic life on campus.<br />\n<br />\n1 A- 4-11-<br />\n<br />\nes<br />\nrtudent<br />\nis best achieved. wlieri tXxc<br />\n<br />\nto the editor<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nconducive to studying, supplying<br />\n<br />\nthe best teachers, materials, and<br />\n<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\n<br />\nwas the case recently when a<br />\nthe end of the 19th Century, as all<br />\nwriters after that were presupposed<br />\nto be radicals and undeserving<br />\nimmigrants. Since then, that<br />\nliterary aspect of the university has<br />\nbeen accordingly assumed by the<br />\nEnglish department, and the<br />\nWriting Seminars evolved to<br />\nsomething of a studio course.<br />\nBarth also relates that the year<br />\n1953, which was his last as a<br />\nstudent at Hopkins, was the last<br />\ntime the Seminars was to have all<br />\nof the money and staff which it<br />\nneeded to fill its academic<br />\npurposes. Karl Shapiro was here<br />\nthen, and Louis Ruben...<br />\nIn enlarging the Writing<br />\nSeminars, Barth was implicit in his<br />\ninference that the Seminars will<br />\nonce again take on the pedagogical<br />\nscope that they did back in the<br />\nforties and fifties. It should be<br />\nmentioned here that the Writing<br />\nSeminars at this university were<br />\nthe first of its kind anywhere in<br />\nthe university world; and it only<br />\nfitting that they should return to<br />\nprominence. The intention is that<br />\nwriting should return to the<br />\ndiligent apprenticeship it once was,<br />\nproducing not only competent<br />\nwriters, but craftsmen skilled in<br />\neditorial and magazine work as<br />\nNne11. o insure this,the Seminars is<br />\na phew<br />\n<br />\nstudents who happen to offer less<br />\nthan tremendous commercial<br />\nsuccess to the New York Trade<br />\nPublishers, a sort of literary<br />\nmonopoly which happens to hold<br />\nmost of the strings in the<br />\npublishing world at this time. Mr.<br />\nBarth reports affirmative \"warm<br />\n4nd ready\" cooperation of the<br />\nUniversity in these projects, and, as<br />\nan added incentive, he notes that<br />\nthe Seminars budget has been<br />\nrewarded with new prosperity for<br />\nthe furtherance of their exploits.<br />\nThe Writing Seminars haven't<br />\nhad the budget, personnel, or the<br />\nknowhow to do all of those<br />\ncolossal things in recent years, or<br />\neven to dream about them. The'<br />\nseemingly sudden interest of the<br />\nadministration on this campus in<br />\nrevamping the Seminars into<br />\nsomething more productive is not<br />\nso recent, however, as it may look<br />\nat first glance. When Barth, after<br />\nhis notorious literary success, was<br />\nrecruited to be a member of the<br />\nfacultyhere, he made the<br />\nstipulation that the university<br />\nwould make this gesture, would, in<br />\nfact, make more than a gesture; it<br />\nmust make a committment to<br />\nmake the Seminars everything that<br />\nby all standards it was, and had<br />\nevery potential to be. When dealing<br />\nwith an academic institution in a<br />\nvery serious way, the most<br />\nimportant thing is to be able to<br />\noffer it that which it feeds on,<br />\nwhich is prestige, and Barth did<br />\nthis, in the most magnanimous of<br />\nways.<br />\nIn the first paragraph of this<br />\nexhortation, I made a reference to<br />\na kind of ideal education, where<br />\nthe student is a free and intuitive<br />\nsoul, set loose in a world of all of<br />\nthe best and most interesting<br />\nthings, seemingly unhindered by<br />\n\"requirements\" and other such<br />\npestiferous things. Such thinking is<br />\nconversation with John Barth<br />\nproved most intelligible, and in its<br />\nmost manifest state, enlightening.<br />\nThe Writing Seminars are far from<br />\ndefunct, or dead, as the case may<br />\nhave been.

Though<br />\nhe is now on the payroll of the<br />\nUniversity, he will not enter into<br />\nhis administrative capacity until<br />\nthis June beyond the role of<br />\nrecruiter, which I understand, he is<br />\nfulfilling in earnest. The<br />\nlong-expected retirement of Elliot<br />\nColeman was delayed another year<br />\non his behalf, while he completes<br />\nthe term of his Guggenheim<br />\nfellowship. The innovatiou here is<br />\nnot limited only to the addition of<br />\na new and eximious personage to<br />\nthe Seminars, but a person lauded<br />\nfor his editorial talents as well as<br />\nhis novelistic ones. A very<br />\nimportant factor, when gaining<br />\nintelligent criticism and learning to<br />\ngive such criticisms are some of the<br />\nbaser things about learning to write<br />\nwith intellectual prowess and<br />\nclarity.<br />\nIn Newman's noble entourage<br />\nwill be Michael Lynch, author of<br />\nAn American Soldier, The Fisher<br />\nKind, and an Opera Libretto, The<br />\nMagician. Also the receptor of<br />\nseveral distinguished grants and<br />\nfellowships, Mr. Lynch is a familiar<br />\nface to those who have been at<br />\nHopkins for long, and is now<br />\ncompleting his leave of absence as<br />\na Hobart lecturer in Vienna. Mr.<br />\nBarth himself will complete his<br />\nsabbatical in January, and renew<br />\nhis teaching efforts, in the second<br />\nsemester of this year.<br />\nBarth spoke emphatically of the<br />\ndistinction between the Writing<br />\nSeminars as they were, are now,<br />\nand will be. When Elliot Coleman<br />\nfounded the Writing Seminars<br />\nsome 25 years ago, it was to fill a<br />\nvery special place in the links of<br />\nacademe. In 1974-1953 Barth<br />\nstudied such authors as Joyce,<br />\nMann, and Kafka, for in those<br />\ntimes these authors were<br />\nunrecognized by most institutions.<br />\nInstead, the English courses<br />\ncovered only the writers who had<br />\nfinished their major works before<br />\nidealistic to the point of being<br />\ncommon and hackneyed, but it<br />\nwas Barth himself who described<br />\nthe nnriergradlinte school as a kind<br />\nof vestibule for graduate school,<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nprofessionals.\" The members of<br />\nthe New Writing Seminars staff will<br />\ndivide their talents between<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate...<br />\n\"The distinction between<br />\nvarious levels of apprenticeship is a<br />\nreal distinction, that corresponds<br />\nalmost perfectly to the distinction<br />\nbetween various levels of<br />\nundergraduates. Many<br />\nundergraduates quickly become<br />\nsophisticated enough so that the<br />\nonly place where they can find<br />\ncorresponding sophistication<br />\nwould be on the graduate level...\"<br />\nSuch a placement of a qualified<br />\nundergraduate would allow such a<br />\nfree-minded soul. as I have<br />\ndescribed to move to the level<br />\nwhich would provide sufficient<br />\nchallenge almost immediately, and<br />\ncould prove to be the most<br />\nvaluable innovation in the Writing<br />\nSeminars.<br />\nThe quality of the Writing<br />\nSeminars as a worthwhile endeavor<br />\nin this institution has been<br />\nquestioned many times in the past<br />\nby those on all sides of<br />\nHomewood. Its most popular<br />\ncourse offering has been \"Words<br />\nand Ideas,\" which brings into<br />\nquestion both the course<br />\nprocedure, and the quality of the<br />\nteachers, which have always been<br />\ngraduate students. Of these things,<br />\nBarth has this to say...<br />\n\"...the very fact that it is subject<br />\nto some criticism from the rest of<br />\nthe university doesn't impress me<br />\nvery much at all...It has always<br />\nbeen taught by graduate<br />\nstudents...some are splendid<br />\nteachers, some are not so splendid<br />\nteachers. They're all teaching for<br />\nthe first time, and the kinds of<br />\nthings they want to do are not<br />\nalways going to correspond with<br />\nthe engineering schools or medical<br />\ninstitutions' notion of what should<br />\nbe going on in a freshman English<br />\ncourse ..\"<br />\n\"...the quality of the graduate<br />\nprogram will only be as good as the<br />\nquality of the students one admits<br />\nto the program, and they've always<br />\nbeen good. My expectation is that<br />\nthey will get better and<br />\nbetter...We've decided to reduce<br />\nthe number of persons accepted<br />\nout gldUUdle programs, ano to<br />\nincrease the variety of things which<br />\ntwo<br />\napplicati......the<br />\nget more<br />\ndozen or so graduate students will<br />\n<br />\nbe absolutely first rate apprentive<br />\ntalents...I don't believe that it is<br />\nnecessary for a first rate writer or<br />\npoet to hang around a university,<br />\nthat<br />\nbut I do believe that it should be<br />\nI will tell you quite frankly<br />\nand<br />\nsaddening<br />\nan article of faith that if they<br />\nthis has been a<br />\nchoose to do a part of their<br />\ndisillusioning experience for my<br />\napprencticeship in the university<br />\nbrother and me.

The University is looked upon<br />\nas an isolated playground for the rich.<br />\nAnd while this, of course, is not entirely<br />\njustifiable,' the image remains. I know a<br />\ngas station attendent on York Road, who<br />\nstudies at Towson State, and he has yet<br />\nto come to the Homewood campus. I<br />\nasked for his reasons and he said, \"Oh<br />\nman, I don't want any chick shooting<br />\nphysics problems at me while I'm trying<br />\nto have a good time.

They<br />\nalways have bands and large crowds,<br />\nsomething which a sizeable percentage of<br />\nthe student body at Hopkins craves for.<br />\nIn any case, someone I met there pegged<br />\nme as a Hopkins student. When I asked<br />\nhim how he knew that dark secret, he<br />\nsaid he could tell by the sweater, pants,<br />\n<br />\nand shoes I was wearing. And although he<br />\nwas friendly, he was noticeably guarded<br />\nin his conversation.

People who never go<br />\ninto the city attack it unmercifully.<br />\nComplaining about Baltimore is<br />\ncontinuous, it's something to talk about.<br />\nIt is hard to accept this criticism from<br />\npeople whose lives are governed wholly<br />\nby Homewood. Perhaps it's the silver<br />\nspoon in the mouth so common to<br />\nstudents here that forces them to put<br />\nforth such invalid condemnation. Being<br />\nborn into fortunate circumstances does<br />\nnot make a person superior, it simply<br />\nmeans that lie was born into fortunate<br />\ncircumstances.<br />\nCrawl Out Your Window<br />\nThe point I'm trying to make is not<br />\nnew. Students from Hopkins have been<br />\nspitting on Baltimore and its residents for<br />\nyears. So much so, that the school now<br />\nhas a distinct and noisome reputation<br />\nwith many outside the campus. The<br />\nStudent Council and similar organizations<br />\ncan help alleviate this image by inviting<br />\nyoung people from the area to its parties<br />\nand dances. Also, more students should<br />\nfrequent the numerous entertainment<br />\ncenters in Baltimore.

Last spring, it was<br />\nrumored that the Orioles would<br />\npack up from Memorial Stadium<br />\nand venture to Washington where<br />\nthe defunct Senators once<br />\nplayed. This theory was devised<br />\nwhen it was learned that about<br />\n20 of the Oriole home games<br />\nwould be televised in the D.C.<br />\narea. It was even speculated that<br />\nthe Birds would even play some<br />\nof their games in D.C. This move<br />\nwould serve to test the water for<br />\na D.C. sponsorship of the<br />\nBaltimore franchise. Besides, the<br />\nOrioles are well received in our<br />\nnation's capital.<br />\nYours<br />\nFortunately, the Birds did not<br />\n<br />\nbia standings<br />\n<br />\nare<br />\n<br />\nof experience at all the key<br />\nscoring positions.

With every passing day,<br />\nthe rumor becomes more factual.<br />\nBut instead of D.C. as the new<br />\nhome of the Orioles, the city of<br />\nNew Orleans is popping up as a<br />\nprospective site.<br />\nThe answer to the question of<br />\nwhy the Orioles would make<br />\nsuch a move is simple. The Birds<br />\nare in a financial squeeze. The<br />\nOrioles pay a six figure sum for<br />\nthe use of Memorial Staduim.<br />\nUnfortunately, the Oriole season<br />\nattendance is only a six figure<br />\nnumber, hovering very close to a<br />\nin<br />\nWhat this means is<br />\nsimply this: the Orioles do not<br />\ndraw well enough in Baltimore to<br />\nsupport the franchise. This is a<br />\nmost discouraging situation for<br />\nOriole fans in Baltimore. Some of<br />\nthe finest baseball played in the<br />\nmajor leagues is played right here<br />\nin this city. Many fans would be<br />\nmightily unhappy to sec the<br />\nBirds go.<br />\nTo compound this problem, it<br />\nseems as though sonic politics<br />\nand big money interests are<br />\ninvolved in attempting to keep<br />\nthe Birds here. The illustrious<br />\nmayor of Baltimore, Donald<br />\nShac fer, has appointed a<br />\ncommission to look into any<br />\npossible solution to the Orioles<br />\n<br />\ncurrent plight.

Rasmussen<br />\nhelped institute the office at the<br />\nbeginning of the last academic<br />\nyear. In this interview, he talked<br />\nabout his role as an assistant to<br />\nBenton, problems he sees on<br />\ncampus, and what will be<br />\nprominent issues In Academic<br />\nServices this year.<br />\nNews-Letter: What exactly do<br />\nyou do as Student Assistant to<br />\nDr. George Benton, Homewood<br />\nVice President?<br />\nEric Rasmussen: Basically I try<br />\nto relay any concerns of the<br />\nundergraduates within Benton's<br />\nservices to Dr. Benton.<br />\nN-L: Why can't students relay<br />\nthose concerns to Benton personally?<br />\nRasmussen: In part they can.<br />\nLast year I tried to make that<br />\npossible with open office hours.<br />\nI'd be willing to bet no more<br />\nthan 25 students came. Part of<br />\nmy job is to relay problems that I<br />\nsee and bring them into the open.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that more<br />\nstudents had things to discuss<br />\nwith Dr. Benton last year than<br />\ncame to see him. In other words,<br />\n\"Looking For<br />\na Roommate?\"<br /><br />\nis there a need for a position to<br />\nlink students to Benton?<br />\nRasmussen: There is a need.<br />\nBenton makes decisions that<br />\naffects students. For example,<br />\nhe's the boss over the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office. In the event that<br />\nanything happens to one of the<br />\noffices he's in charge of, a<br />\nstudent is there to relay the<br />\nconcerns of the undergraduates.<br />\nHalf the job is sniffing out what<br />\nyou think is wrong. For example,<br />\nthe admissions office last year.<br />\nNot too many people understood<br />\nthat issue.<br />\nN-L: How much genuine<br />\ninfluence do you think you have<br />\nwith respect to Dr. Benton's<br />\ndecisions?<br />\nRasmussen: Not a hell of alot.<br />\nI think he respects my opinion. If<br />\nthere are issues that demand<br />\nimmediate attention, I'll go in<br />\nand talk to him, and ask him why<br />\nhe took a particular course of<br />\naction. I'll relay to him my<br />\nconcerns, and try to convince<br />\nhim of my position. But I don't<br />\nthink he'd call me in and sit me<br />\ndown before he would make any<br />\nmajor decision and ask for my<br />\nopinion.<br />\nN-L: What concrete things can<br />\nyou point to as your<br />\naccomplishments as Student<br />\nAssistant?<br />\nRasmussen: I don't think I<br /><br />\ncould cite anything concrete. But<br />\nI did help form the Student<br />\nBudget Advisory Committee,<br />\ninvestigated the admissions office<br />\nlast year, opened up office hours<br />\nfor Benton. This year I'm looking<br />\ninto the Dean of Students Office.<br />\nI think these things are concrete<br />\nin that they fulfill what I want to<br />\ndo over there. They point out<br />\nsituations that are unfair or<br />\noperate against student interests.<br />\nN-L: What are you looking<br />\ninto in the Dean of Seudents<br />\noffice?<br />\nRasmussen: There are three<br />\nthings that I'd like to look at this<br />\nyear: the proposal for merit<br />\nscholarships, the Union cost<br />\noverrun and simply the fact that<br />\nthe Dean of Students Office staff<br />\nhas doubled this year.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything in<br />\nparticular you'd like to see done?<br />\nRasmussen: I'd like to find<br />\nout, for instance, why a woman<br />\nwith Mrs. LaPointe's experience<br />\nand affection for students hasn't<br />\nbeen utilized to her fullest<br />\nextent. Meanwhile they've made<br />\nelaborate accomodations for<br />\nother employees.<br />\nN-L: Do many students come<br />\nto you with problems? If so, how<br />\nmany, and what kind of<br />\nproblems do they bring?<br />\nRasmussen: Not too many<br />\ncome. In fact, I probably go to<br /><br />\nsee more students than students<br />\ncome to see me. Those who do<br />\ncome and talk to me about<br />\ncurrent issues. If I can't help<br />\nthem, I refer them to Benton, or<br />\nthe right man in that area. I<br />\nimagine I'll have alot of people<br />\nseeing me about merit<br />\nscholarships as publicity grows.<br />\nN-L: How great a time<br />\ninvestment does your position<br />\nentail?<br />\nRasmussen: I'd say 10-15<br />\nhours a week.<br />\nN-L: Do you receive a salary?<br />\nRasmussen: Yes.<br />\nN-L: How much?<br />\nRasmussen: I better not say<br />\nhow much, but it's minimum<br />\nwage.<br />\nN-L: Is there any conflict of<br />\ninterest?<br />\nRasmussen: When I pick up<br />\nmy check, I don't view the<br />\nmoney I'm getting as coming<br />\nfrom the office of the Vice<br />\nPresident. I don't represent that<br />\noffice's interests. I represent the<br />\nstudents but more important,<br />\nwhat I think is right.<br />\nN-L: What are your thoughts<br />\non the reorganization plan in<br />\nAcademic Services that's gone on<br />\nover the last two years?<br />\nRasmussen: I think it's<br />\nexcellent. It centralizes this<br />\noffice around a single<br />\nadministrator. Previously, it was<br /><br />\na series, of offices unconnected.<br />\nThey're now related to one<br />\nanother through a_ single<br />\nadministrator\u2014Larry Denton. It's<br />\ninfinitely better for students who<br />\nhave a particular problem. Larry<br />\nis on the same level with the<br />\nDean of Students. He's much<br />\nmore accessible than Benton.<br />\nN-L: From your viewpoint, is<br />\nthere a cumbersome<br />\nadministrative bureaucracy here?<br />\nRasmussen: I don't think it's<br />\nas difficult to transcend as many<br />\n.others because it's a lot smaller.<br />\nThey operate bureaucratically,<br />\nbut that may be the way they<br />\nhave to operate.<br />\nN-L: Before you graduate this<br />\nJune, what is the one thing you'd<br />\nlike to see accomplished?<br />\nRasmussen: I want to see three<br />\nthings. A re-evaluation of the<br />\nDean of Students Office,<br />\nicnreased financial aid, especially<br />\nin line with tuition increases, and<br />\nthat certain student services<br />\npersonnel, who are currently<br />\nbeing abused and ignored, are<br />\ngiven their due.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything else<br />\nyou'd like to add?<br />\nRasmussen: I think my job can<br />\nbe perpetuated. I would like to<br />\nsee more involvement with the<br />\nStudent Council, but I'd also like<br />\nto see the Student Assistant given<br />\nthe flexibility that I have.<br /><br />\n\"The<br />\nRoommate<br />\nConnection\"<br />\nis a referral service agency.<br />\nClients have the option of<br />\naccepting or rejecting prospective<br />\nroommates.<br /><br />\n\"The<br />\nRoommate<br />\nConnection\"<br />\nhas up to date listings available.<br />\nThe foe Is reasonable<br />\nIA the see-vice Is<br /><br />\noccurato.<br /><br />\nCall us Tues.<br />\nThurs.or Sat.<br />\n10 A.M.-7 P.M.<br />\n3234220<br /><br />\nThere is a<br />\ndifferenceN<br />\nPREPARATION<br />\nMW<br />\nBAT<br />\n1111<br />\nCIE<br />\nATCSB<br />\nOCAT<br />\nCMI<br />\nFLEX<br />\nECIFFAC<br />\nNATI WO BUS<br />\nOver 35 years<br />\nof experience<br />\nand success\u2022<br />\nSmall classes<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nVoluminous home<br />\nstudy materials<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nCourses that are<br />\nconstantly updated<br />\n\u2022<br />\nMake-ups for<br />\nmissed lessons<br /><br />\nFor complete information call:<br /><br />\n(301) 530-0211<br /><br />\nBe good to your stomach.

Though a substantial<br />\noverrun has<br />\nbeen covertly acknowledged by Hopkins<br />\nadministrators in off<br />\nthie record confessions, Homewood Vice President<br />\nGeorge<br />\nBe:nton and William Campbell,<br />\nDirector of Plant<br />\nMainagement, have contrived to hide the printed figures<br />\nfrom<br />\nth( public.<br />\nThe run-around game Benton and Campbell have used is a<br />\nchildish and unproductive one. Students, faculty, and<br />\nall<br />\nme mbers of the Hopkins community are entitled to know<br />\nthe<br />\nspecifics about the price of Homewood's newest<br />\nbuilding,<br />\nancI about any errors which may have gone into its<br />\nconstri<br />\nt is apparent that those officials associated with the<br />\nconstrliction of the Union chose to do things in an<br />\nexpensive<br />\nwa)<br />\n(, with little regard for economy or the elegance of simplic ity. It is also plain that some have gotten fat on<br />\nthe<br />\nconstruction of the Union in both the design and construiction phases.<br />\nt seems inconsistent and suspicious of University officials<br />\nto vithhold the specifics of the cost overrun in these times of<br />\ntigh t budgets, inasmuch as people usually do not hide<br />\nthings<br />\nunit ss there is something to be hidden.<br /><br />\n\"Historically its been the case that<br />\nthe whole humanities operation<br />\nhas been the tail on the dog, but.<br />\nit's also been the case that it's been<br />\na distinguished tail, and while it<br />\nhasn't exactly wagged the dog, it's<br />\nhardly been a mere appendage.<br />\nYou know as well as I that from<br />\nthe beginning of the Homewood<br />\noperation, there's been<br />\ndistinguished scholars on the<br />\nfaculty. The university's<br />\nconception of itself in the<br />\nhumanities has been, I take it, to<br />\nremain very small,, but very<br />\ndistinguished. Our modest<br />\nambition in the Writing Seminars is<br />\nvery quickly to become the most<br />\ndistinguished operations of its kind<br />\nin the country...\"<br />\nJohn Barth<br />\n10/17/74<br />\nThis year, it seems, will be<br />\nmarked by more distinctive<br />\nchanges and transition than most<br />\nin recent memory. It would<br />\nprobably be safe to say that more<br />\nsuperficially solid governments<br />\nhave fallen or undergone<br />\nhierarchical facelifting in this year<br />\nthan in any yeat since World War<br />\nII. No longer do we read post<br />\nmortems on the late sixties and<br />\nsigh, wondering what new causes<br />\nthere are to take up, what new<br />\nmovements are in the offing. The<br />\nworld passes, a virtual maelstrom,<br />\nand we, holding tightly to our<br />\ncopies of Homer and Kant,<br />\n.forestay the day when we too will<br />\nhave to dip our heads over the cleft<br />\nto view that disheartening,<br />\nvertiginous swirl of things that<br />\nawaits us. Such is the crux of<br />\nthings. There will be no more<br />\nmovements to swell and catch us<br />\nby surprise, where we may drift in<br />\nprotest and \"unified anger.\"<br />\ninstead, there is something<br />\nintensely more terrifying about<br />\ntrying to touch our feet on the<br />\nbottom of this stream, to grab<br />\nhold, and to be a rock. That's why<br />\nwe're here, not to be \"educated\"<br />\nbecause it is virtually impossible to<br />\nteach anyone anything. The idea is<br />\nto learn how to learn.<br />\nTheoretically. this leaminc, nrorecs<br /><br />\nist of thousands<br /><br />\nCZ<br /><br />\nEric Rasmussen's assertions in his interview [page 4] that<br />\nthere are certain situations in the Dean of Students Office<br />\nthat need examination are right on target. The Office was<br />\nformed not more than three years ago. Since then, the Office<br />\nhas had tremendous success in<br />\nachieving what it set out to<br />\ndo\u2014improve student services.<br />\nBut we wonder why now, when the initial load of the<br />\nimprovements have been made, it has been necessary to<br />\ndouble the Dean of Students' staff. The Dean has an<br />\nAssistant Dean, an Executive Assistant, and a secretary to aid<br />\nhim directly. Not even the academic deans have so thorough<br />\na complement of assistant workers.<br />\nAs the Hopkins Union finally gets underway and moves<br />\ninto full swing, it seems as if now is the time for an<br />\nevaluation of the Dean of Students Office. Is it fulfilling the<br />\nneeds of the community as well as it did in its first years? Is<br />\nit run effectively?<br />\nThese are questions that should be<br />\nscrutinized, so that the Dean of Students Office can continue<br />\nto improve the non-academic life on campus.<br /><br />\n1 A- 4-11-<br /><br />\nes<br />\nrtudent<br />\nis best achieved. wlieri tXxc<br /><br />\nto the editor<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nconducive to studying, supplying<br /><br />\nthe best teachers, materials, and<br /><br />\nJohn Barth<br /><br />\nwas the case recently when a<br />\nthe end of the 19th Century, as all<br />\nwriters after that were presupposed<br />\nto be radicals and undeserving<br />\nimmigrants. Since then, that<br />\nliterary aspect of the university has<br />\nbeen accordingly assumed by the<br />\nEnglish department, and the<br />\nWriting Seminars evolved to<br />\nsomething of a studio course.<br />\nBarth also relates that the year<br />\n1953, which was his last as a<br />\nstudent at Hopkins, was the last<br />\ntime the Seminars was to have all<br />\nof the money and staff which it<br />\nneeded to fill its academic<br />\npurposes. Karl Shapiro was here<br />\nthen, and Louis Ruben...<br />\nIn enlarging the Writing<br />\nSeminars, Barth was implicit in his<br />\ninference that the Seminars will<br />\nonce again take on the pedagogical<br />\nscope that they did back in the<br />\nforties and fifties. It should be<br />\nmentioned here that the Writing<br />\nSeminars at this university were<br />\nthe first of its kind anywhere in<br />\nthe university world; and it only<br />\nfitting that they should return to<br />\nprominence. The intention is that<br />\nwriting should return to the<br />\ndiligent apprenticeship it once was,<br />\nproducing not only competent<br />\nwriters, but craftsmen skilled in<br />\neditorial and magazine work as<br />\nNne11. o insure this,the Seminars is<br />\na phew<br /><br />\nstudents who happen to offer less<br />\nthan tremendous commercial<br />\nsuccess to the New York Trade<br />\nPublishers, a sort of literary<br />\nmonopoly which happens to hold<br />\nmost of the strings in the<br />\npublishing world at this time. Mr.<br />\nBarth reports affirmative \"warm<br />\n4nd ready\" cooperation of the<br />\nUniversity in these projects, and, as<br />\nan added incentive, he notes that<br />\nthe Seminars budget has been<br />\nrewarded with new prosperity for<br />\nthe furtherance of their exploits.<br />\nThe Writing Seminars haven't<br />\nhad the budget, personnel, or the<br />\nknowhow to do all of those<br />\ncolossal things in recent years, or<br />\neven to dream about them. The'<br />\nseemingly sudden interest of the<br />\nadministration on this campus in<br />\nrevamping the Seminars into<br />\nsomething more productive is not<br />\nso recent, however, as it may look<br />\nat first glance. When Barth, after<br />\nhis notorious literary success, was<br />\nrecruited to be a member of the<br />\nfacultyhere, he made the<br />\nstipulation that the university<br />\nwould make this gesture, would, in<br />\nfact, make more than a gesture; it<br />\nmust make a committment to<br />\nmake the Seminars everything that<br />\nby all standards it was, and had<br />\nevery potential to be. When dealing<br />\nwith an academic institution in a<br />\nvery serious way, the most<br />\nimportant thing is to be able to<br />\noffer it that which it feeds on,<br />\nwhich is prestige, and Barth did<br />\nthis, in the most magnanimous of<br />\nways.<br />\nIn the first paragraph of this<br />\nexhortation, I made a reference to<br />\na kind of ideal education, where<br />\nthe student is a free and intuitive<br />\nsoul, set loose in a world of all of<br />\nthe best and most interesting<br />\nthings, seemingly unhindered by<br />\n\"requirements\" and other such<br />\npestiferous things. Such thinking is<br />\nconversation with John Barth<br />\nproved most intelligible, and in its<br />\nmost manifest state, enlightening.<br />\nThe Writing Seminars are far from<br />\ndefunct, or dead, as the case may<br />\nhave been.

Though<br />\nhe is now on the payroll of the<br />\nUniversity, he will not enter into<br />\nhis administrative capacity until<br />\nthis June beyond the role of<br />\nrecruiter, which I understand, he is<br />\nfulfilling in earnest. The<br />\nlong-expected retirement of Elliot<br />\nColeman was delayed another year<br />\non his behalf, while he completes<br />\nthe term of his Guggenheim<br />\nfellowship. The innovatiou here is<br />\nnot limited only to the addition of<br />\na new and eximious personage to<br />\nthe Seminars, but a person lauded<br />\nfor his editorial talents as well as<br />\nhis novelistic ones. A very<br />\nimportant factor, when gaining<br />\nintelligent criticism and learning to<br />\ngive such criticisms are some of the<br />\nbaser things about learning to write<br />\nwith intellectual prowess and<br />\nclarity.<br />\nIn Newman's noble entourage<br />\nwill be Michael Lynch, author of<br />\nAn American Soldier, The Fisher<br />\nKind, and an Opera Libretto, The<br />\nMagician. Also the receptor of<br />\nseveral distinguished grants and<br />\nfellowships, Mr. Lynch is a familiar<br />\nface to those who have been at<br />\nHopkins for long, and is now<br />\ncompleting his leave of absence as<br />\na Hobart lecturer in Vienna. Mr.<br />\nBarth himself will complete his<br />\nsabbatical in January, and renew<br />\nhis teaching efforts, in the second<br />\nsemester of this year.<br />\nBarth spoke emphatically of the<br />\ndistinction between the Writing<br />\nSeminars as they were, are now,<br />\nand will be. When Elliot Coleman<br />\nfounded the Writing Seminars<br />\nsome 25 years ago, it was to fill a<br />\nvery special place in the links of<br />\nacademe. In 1974-1953 Barth<br />\nstudied such authors as Joyce,<br />\nMann, and Kafka, for in those<br />\ntimes these authors were<br />\nunrecognized by most institutions.<br />\nInstead, the English courses<br />\ncovered only the writers who had<br />\nfinished their major works before<br />\nidealistic to the point of being<br />\ncommon and hackneyed, but it<br />\nwas Barth himself who described<br />\nthe nnriergradlinte school as a kind<br />\nof vestibule for graduate school,<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nprofessionals.\" The members of<br />\nthe New Writing Seminars staff will<br />\ndivide their talents between<br />\ngraduate and undergraduate...<br />\n\"The distinction between<br />\nvarious levels of apprenticeship is a<br />\nreal distinction, that corresponds<br />\nalmost perfectly to the distinction<br />\nbetween various levels of<br />\nundergraduates. Many<br />\nundergraduates quickly become<br />\nsophisticated enough so that the<br />\nonly place where they can find<br />\ncorresponding sophistication<br />\nwould be on the graduate level...\"<br />\nSuch a placement of a qualified<br />\nundergraduate would allow such a<br />\nfree-minded soul. as I have<br />\ndescribed to move to the level<br />\nwhich would provide sufficient<br />\nchallenge almost immediately, and<br />\ncould prove to be the most<br />\nvaluable innovation in the Writing<br />\nSeminars.<br />\nThe quality of the Writing<br />\nSeminars as a worthwhile endeavor<br />\nin this institution has been<br />\nquestioned many times in the past<br />\nby those on all sides of<br />\nHomewood. Its most popular<br />\ncourse offering has been \"Words<br />\nand Ideas,\" which brings into<br />\nquestion both the course<br />\nprocedure, and the quality of the<br />\nteachers, which have always been<br />\ngraduate students. Of these things,<br />\nBarth has this to say...<br />\n\"...the very fact that it is subject<br />\nto some criticism from the rest of<br />\nthe university doesn't impress me<br />\nvery much at all...It has always<br />\nbeen taught by graduate<br />\nstudents...some are splendid<br />\nteachers, some are not so splendid<br />\nteachers. They're all teaching for<br />\nthe first time, and the kinds of<br />\nthings they want to do are not<br />\nalways going to correspond with<br />\nthe engineering schools or medical<br />\ninstitutions' notion of what should<br />\nbe going on in a freshman English<br />\ncourse ..\"<br />\n\"...the quality of the graduate<br />\nprogram will only be as good as the<br />\nquality of the students one admits<br />\nto the program, and they've always<br />\nbeen good. My expectation is that<br />\nthey will get better and<br />\nbetter...We've decided to reduce<br />\nthe number of persons accepted<br />\nout gldUUdle programs, ano to<br />\nincrease the variety of things which<br />\ntwo<br />\napplicati......the<br />\nget more<br />\ndozen or so graduate students will<br /><br />\nbe absolutely first rate apprentive<br />\ntalents...I don't believe that it is<br />\nnecessary for a first rate writer or<br />\npoet to hang around a university,<br />\nthat<br />\nbut I do believe that it should be<br />\nI will tell you quite frankly<br />\nand<br />\nsaddening<br />\nan article of faith that if they<br />\nthis has been a<br />\nchoose to do a part of their<br />\ndisillusioning experience for my<br />\napprencticeship in the university<br />\nbrother and me.

Ridiculous. no`?<br />\nObviously One Believer<br />\nHopkins has an image among young<br />\npeople in Baltimore that must be<br />\ndispelled. The University is looked upon<br />\nas an isolated playground for the rich.<br />\nAnd while this, of course, is not entirely<br />\njustifiable,' the image remains. I know a<br />\ngas station attendent on York Road, who<br />\nstudies at Towson State, and he has yet<br />\nto come to the Homewood campus. I<br />\nasked for his reasons and he said, \"Oh<br />\nman, I don't want any chick shooting<br />\nphysics problems at me while I'm trying<br />\nto have a good time.

Students from Hopkins have been<br />\nspitting on Baltimore and its residents for<br />\nyears. So much so, that the school now<br />\nhas a distinct and noisome reputation<br />\nwith many outside the campus. The<br />\nStudent Council and similar organizations<br />\ncan help alleviate this image by inviting<br />\nyoung people from the area to its parties<br />\nand dances.

Last spring, it was<br />\nrumored that the Orioles would<br />\npack up from Memorial Stadium<br />\nand venture to Washington where<br />\nthe defunct Senators once<br />\nplayed. This theory was devised<br />\nwhen it was learned that about<br />\n20 of the Oriole home games<br />\nwould be televised in the D.C.<br />\narea. It was even speculated that<br />\nthe Birds would even play some<br />\nof their games in D.C. This move<br />\nwould serve to test the water for<br />\na D.C. sponsorship of the<br />\nBaltimore franchise. Besides, the<br />\nOrioles are well received in our<br />\nnation's capital.<br />\nYours<br />\nFortunately, the Birds did not<br /><br />\nbia standings<br /><br />\nare<br /><br />\nof experience at all the key<br />\nscoring positions.

The Birds<br />\nare in a financial squeeze.

This is a<br />\nmost discouraging situation for<br />\nOriole fans in Baltimore. Some of<br />\nthe finest baseball played in the<br />\nmajor leagues is played right here<br />\nin this city. Many fans would be<br />\nmightily unhappy to sec the<br />\nBirds go.<br />\nTo compound this problem, it<br />\nseems as though sonic politics<br />\nand big money interests are<br />\ninvolved in attempting to keep<br />\nthe Birds here. The illustrious<br />\nmayor of Baltimore, Donald<br />\nShac fer, has appointed a<br />\ncommission to look into any<br />\npossible solution to the Orioles<br /><br />\ncurrent plight. The owners of the<br />\nclub are talking move, especially<br />\na move to New Orleans where a<br />\nbrand new multi-million dollar<br />\nindoor sports complex is being<br />\nconstructed. The mayor would<br />\nlike to see that this does not.<br />\nhappen. Neither would a lot of<br />\npeople. But it seems as though<br />\nthe mayor has a more selfish<br />\ninterest in the matter. This being<br />\nthe erection of a multi-million<br />\nsports arena in the downtown<br />\narea.<br />\nIf the Birds are lost, this will<br />\nbe an indication of Baltimore's<br />\ninability to support a major<br />\nleague professional team.<br />\nWithout this support the<br />\nproposed sports complex for the<br />\ndowntown would be thwarted.<br />\nWhen the Bullets left for the<br />\nMaryland suburbs, it was already<br />\nan indication of this fact.<br />\nIf the Orioles leave, it will be<br />\nquite a long time before any<br />\npromoter would select Baltimore<br />\nfor a location of a sports team.<br />\nThis would leave the mayor with<br />\nnothing to build a sports<br />\ncomplex downtown for.
