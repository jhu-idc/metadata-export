E. KENNNDY, JR.<br />\n<br />\nThis article continues an<br />\ninterview with Dr. Stanley K.<br />\nHornbeck on U.S. China foreign policy. Dr. Hornbeck has<br />\ntaught at several American<br />\nuniversities including a four<br />\nyear tenure at Harvard from<br />\n1924-1928. Since the end of<br />\nWorld War I, Dr. Hornbeck<br />\nhas served in many positions<br />\nin or under the U.S. State<br />\nDept. From 1944 to 1947 he was<br />\nU.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.<br />\nDr. Hornbeck feels that the<br />\nUnited States shares considerable<br />\nblame in the Communist takeover of China in 1949. The foreign policy of the Truman administration failed to realize that<br />\nthe civil war in China was not<br />\nmerely internal and that aggressive, external Communist subversion against the Kuomintang<br />\nregime ought to have been met<br />\nwith more substantial economic<br />\nsupport of Chiang-kai Cheks'<br />\nforces.<br />\nThe Nationalist Chinese Embassy writes on this subject:<br />\n\"When Japan surrendered in<br />\n1945, China was an exhausted<br />\nand devastated country. Many<br />\nleaders abroad, still unaware of<br />\nthe aggressive character of Communism, urged Chiang Kai-shek<br />\nto reach a political settlement<br />\nwith the Chinese Communists.\"<br />\n<br />\nthe entire Communist World, he<br />\ndenies that we must accept the<br />\nChinese Communist regime as<br />\npermanent fact.<br />\n<br />\n\"It is true,\" he said, \"that<br />\nthroughout the Mainland there<br />\nis severe famine, widespread suffering resulting in discontent and<br />\nresentment of the Mao Tse Tung<br />\nregime.\" Dr. Hornbeck does not<br />\ninterpret the Nationalist Premier's recent report indicative of<br />\nforthcoming plans for invasion<br />\nof the mainland. The Republic's<br />\nposition, he feels, has always<br />\nbeen to the effect that if and<br />\nwhen there arises on the mainland a rebellion to which Taiwan<br />\ncould be of assistance, then military support would follow.<br />\nAsked to give his opinion on<br />\ncurrent prevailing attitudes on<br />\nthe admission of Red China to<br />\nthe U.N., Dr. Hornbeck said that<br />\nthe predominant theme in many<br />\nquarters seemed to be that such<br />\nadmission was 'inevitable,' and<br />\nthat the United States should<br />\ncease to oppose the inevitable<br />\nand reshape its policies accordingly.<br />\n\"The thesis,\" he said, \"is challengeable because, first of all,<br />\nan affirmation of a future inevitability ... can be not more<br />\nthan an expression by its affirm-<br />\n<br />\npersonal opinion: \"I consider it<br />\nvery untimely that Red China<br />\nwill be voted a member of the<br />\nU.N. in this assembly.\"<br />\nDr. Hornbeck denies that the<br />\nUnited States was inconsistent<br />\nwhen having conceded to the<br />\nadmission of Russia in the U.N.<br />\nand granted diplomatic recognition it refuses such recognition<br />\nof Communist China. \"The very<br />\nfact,\" he said, \"that we did concede to Soviet representation and<br />\ngrant<br />\nrecognition<br />\ndiplomatic<br />\nshould have taught us a lesson<br />\nto avoid the same mistake again.\"<br />\nOn the argument that disarmament is impossible without<br />\nRed Chinese Recognition, the experienced statesman said: \"Peohis ple have been trying to disarm<br />\n<br />\nant of an opinion\u2014well reasoned,<br />\nperhaps, and well expressed, but<br />\nstill an opinion. And opinions<br />\ndiffer ... No one can now foresee or with warrant predict what<br />\nwill be during the next few<br />\nmonths the major developments<br />\nin the situation within and the<br />\nrelationships between and among<br />\nthe countries or groups that<br />\ncompose collectively the Family<br />\nof Nations . . .

There were indications and<br />\nthere were affirmations in 1932<br />\nthat 'Manchukuo' was a permanent fact.

The works<br />\nare grouped into several galleries<br />\narranged chonologically in the<br />\n<br />\nLast Chance<br />\nThe Student Council is now reaching completion of<br />\nthe long awaited and much heralded revision of their<br />\nconstitution. Before the gate shuts for good, several comments and suggestions are in order.<br />\nThe first point to be made is that this new constitution should finally end the reign of the autonomous<br />\nstudent bodies on this campus which in large part dominate student life. Included in these are the Booster Club,<br />\nthe Cotillion Board, and the BIA.<br />\nThe reasons for this are two-fold. In the first place<br />\nthese groups are too often and too blatantly controlled or<br />\ninfluenced by fraternities. In each of these groups one or<br />\nmore fraternities has carved out of student government<br />\ntheir own private shiekdom which they are able to maintain from year to year.<br />\nSecondly, the avowed purpose of the Student Council is to govern the campus not to give away its powers. If<br />\nthe SC is ever to function it must have at least some of<br />\nthe powers that are currently in the hands of these<br />\ngroups.<br />\nThe second point is that somewhere in the new SC<br />\nConstitution provision should be made for the establishment of a non-academic judiciary board. The need of<br />\nsuch a body has been demonstrated time and again. This<br />\nis the chance to give it life.<br />\nThirdly, and most important is the need for the new<br />\nconstitution to protide real representation for the Hopkins student. At the moment once the ballot has been<br />\ncast, usually on the basis of the best or funniest sign, all<br />\nrepresentation ceases. The student has no means of initiating legislation or approving the legislation passed.<br />\nHe has no idea of what his so called representative thinks<br />\nor what he plans to do. In effect the present system provides for misrepresentation rather than representation.<br />\nThere are three ways to remedy this situation. The<br />\nfirst of these is recall. But this would hardly be an adequate solution. The sound remedy is referendum on<br />\nmajor issues. While this would allow the students to voice<br />\ntheir opinion on measures passed, it still would not give<br />\nthem an opportunity to make new suggestions:<br />\nThe third and most feasible solution would be the<br />\nestablishment of political parties on campus. A member<br />\nof such a party would be bound to carry out the party<br />\nplatform and would respect the wishes and suggestions<br />\nof the members of his party. Thus true representation<br />\nwould be achieved in the Student Council.<br />\n<br />\nThe \"Socialist\" Question<br />\nThe recent flurry of charges and counter-charges<br />\nover the distribution of \"socialist\" literature has stimulated a good deal of incoherent and confused discussion<br />\nof this \"socialism.\" By way of clarification, we shall<br />\nadd our piece and hope that it doesn't contribute too<br />\nmuch to the confusion.<br />\nThe newspaper The Young Socialist is a publication of the \"Young Socialist Alliance,\" the Baltimore<br />\nchapter of which is attempting to distribute the newspaper and other literature on the Johns Hopkins campus.<br />\nThe \"Young Socialist Alliance\" (YSA) is more or less<br />\naffiliated with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a<br />\nnational political party whose program has been described as Trotskyist.

A blanket ban on the distribution of this<br />\nliterature because the ideas presented are unpopular<br />\nwould indeed draw our vigorous editorial opposition.<br />\nHowever, we fail to see that the administration has enjoined the YS4 from free distribution and consequently<br />\nwill reserve comment until the dust clears and the issue<br />\ncrystalizes,<br />\n<br />\nIn a spurt of late Saturday<br />\nnight activity and architectural<br />\nimagination, the Adams House<br />\nHeavy<br />\nConstruction<br />\nSociety<br />\nerected the very first combination fallout shelter and Berlin<br />\nbarricade in the. world.

E. KENNNDY, JR.<br /><br />\nThis article continues an<br />\ninterview with Dr. Stanley K.<br />\nHornbeck on U.S. China foreign policy. Dr. Hornbeck has<br />\ntaught at several American<br />\nuniversities including a four<br />\nyear tenure at Harvard from<br />\n1924-1928. Since the end of<br />\nWorld War I, Dr. Hornbeck<br />\nhas served in many positions<br />\nin or under the U.S. State<br />\nDept. From 1944 to 1947 he was<br />\nU.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands.<br />\nDr. Hornbeck feels that the<br />\nUnited States shares considerable<br />\nblame in the Communist takeover of China in 1949. The foreign policy of the Truman administration failed to realize that<br />\nthe civil war in China was not<br />\nmerely internal and that aggressive, external Communist subversion against the Kuomintang<br />\nregime ought to have been met<br />\nwith more substantial economic<br />\nsupport of Chiang-kai Cheks'<br />\nforces.<br />\nThe Nationalist Chinese Embassy writes on this subject:<br />\n\"When Japan surrendered in<br />\n1945, China was an exhausted<br />\nand devastated country. Many<br />\nleaders abroad, still unaware of<br />\nthe aggressive character of Communism, urged Chiang Kai-shek<br />\nto reach a political settlement<br />\nwith the Chinese Communists.\"<br /><br />\nthe entire Communist World, he<br />\ndenies that we must accept the<br />\nChinese Communist regime as<br />\npermanent fact.<br /><br />\n\"It is true,\" he said, \"that<br />\nthroughout the Mainland there<br />\nis severe famine, widespread suffering resulting in discontent and<br />\nresentment of the Mao Tse Tung<br />\nregime.\" Dr. Hornbeck does not<br />\ninterpret the Nationalist Premier's recent report indicative of<br />\nforthcoming plans for invasion<br />\nof the mainland. The Republic's<br />\nposition, he feels, has always<br />\nbeen to the effect that if and<br />\nwhen there arises on the mainland a rebellion to which Taiwan<br />\ncould be of assistance, then military support would follow.<br />\nAsked to give his opinion on<br />\ncurrent prevailing attitudes on<br />\nthe admission of Red China to<br />\nthe U.N., Dr. Hornbeck said that<br />\nthe predominant theme in many<br />\nquarters seemed to be that such<br />\nadmission was 'inevitable,' and<br />\nthat the United States should<br />\ncease to oppose the inevitable<br />\nand reshape its policies accordingly.<br />\n\"The thesis,\" he said, \"is challengeable because, first of all,<br />\nan affirmation of a future inevitability ... can be not more<br />\nthan an expression by its affirm-<br /><br />\npersonal opinion: \"I consider it<br />\nvery untimely that Red China<br />\nwill be voted a member of the<br />\nU.N. in this assembly.\"<br />\nDr. Hornbeck denies that the<br />\nUnited States was inconsistent<br />\nwhen having conceded to the<br />\nadmission of Russia in the U.N.<br />\nand granted diplomatic recognition it refuses such recognition<br />\nof Communist China. \"The very<br />\nfact,\" he said, \"that we did concede to Soviet representation and<br />\ngrant<br />\nrecognition<br />\ndiplomatic<br />\nshould have taught us a lesson<br />\nto avoid the same mistake again.\"<br />\nOn the argument that disarmament is impossible without<br />\nRed Chinese Recognition, the experienced statesman said: \"Peohis ple have been trying to disarm<br /><br />\nant of an opinion\u2014well reasoned,<br />\nperhaps, and well expressed, but<br />\nstill an opinion. And opinions<br />\ndiffer ... No one can now foresee or with warrant predict what<br />\nwill be during the next few<br />\nmonths the major developments<br />\nin the situation within and the<br />\nrelationships between and among<br />\nthe countries or groups that<br />\ncompose collectively the Family<br />\nof Nations . . .

The works<br />\nare grouped into several galleries<br />\narranged chonologically in the<br /><br />\nLast Chance<br />\nThe Student Council is now reaching completion of<br />\nthe long awaited and much heralded revision of their<br />\nconstitution. Before the gate shuts for good, several comments and suggestions are in order.<br />\nThe first point to be made is that this new constitution should finally end the reign of the autonomous<br />\nstudent bodies on this campus which in large part dominate student life. Included in these are the Booster Club,<br />\nthe Cotillion Board, and the BIA.<br />\nThe reasons for this are two-fold. In the first place<br />\nthese groups are too often and too blatantly controlled or<br />\ninfluenced by fraternities. In each of these groups one or<br />\nmore fraternities has carved out of student government<br />\ntheir own private shiekdom which they are able to maintain from year to year.<br />\nSecondly, the avowed purpose of the Student Council is to govern the campus not to give away its powers. If<br />\nthe SC is ever to function it must have at least some of<br />\nthe powers that are currently in the hands of these<br />\ngroups.<br />\nThe second point is that somewhere in the new SC<br />\nConstitution provision should be made for the establishment of a non-academic judiciary board. The need of<br />\nsuch a body has been demonstrated time and again. This<br />\nis the chance to give it life.<br />\nThirdly, and most important is the need for the new<br />\nconstitution to protide real representation for the Hopkins student. At the moment once the ballot has been<br />\ncast, usually on the basis of the best or funniest sign, all<br />\nrepresentation ceases. The student has no means of initiating legislation or approving the legislation passed.<br />\nHe has no idea of what his so called representative thinks<br />\nor what he plans to do. In effect the present system provides for misrepresentation rather than representation.<br />\nThere are three ways to remedy this situation. The<br />\nfirst of these is recall. But this would hardly be an adequate solution. The sound remedy is referendum on<br />\nmajor issues. While this would allow the students to voice<br />\ntheir opinion on measures passed, it still would not give<br />\nthem an opportunity to make new suggestions:<br />\nThe third and most feasible solution would be the<br />\nestablishment of political parties on campus. A member<br />\nof such a party would be bound to carry out the party<br />\nplatform and would respect the wishes and suggestions<br />\nof the members of his party. Thus true representation<br />\nwould be achieved in the Student Council.<br /><br />\nThe \"Socialist\" Question<br />\nThe recent flurry of charges and counter-charges<br />\nover the distribution of \"socialist\" literature has stimulated a good deal of incoherent and confused discussion<br />\nof this \"socialism.\" By way of clarification, we shall<br />\nadd our piece and hope that it doesn't contribute too<br />\nmuch to the confusion.<br />\nThe newspaper The Young Socialist is a publication of the \"Young Socialist Alliance,\" the Baltimore<br />\nchapter of which is attempting to distribute the newspaper and other literature on the Johns Hopkins campus.<br />\nThe \"Young Socialist Alliance\" (YSA) is more or less<br />\naffiliated with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a<br />\nnational political party whose program has been described as Trotskyist. The SWP should not be confused<br />\nwith the Socialist Party, led in America by the venerable<br />\nNorman Thomas. The Socialist Party and its youth offspring the \"Young Peoples Socialist League\" (YPSL)<br />\nare bitterly opposed by the YSA\u2014generally for being<br />\ntoo conservative.<br />\nWe cannot as yet discern clear evidence that the<br />\nadministration of this University is engaged in a concerted effort to restrict the free dissemination of YSA<br />\nconvictions. A blanket ban on the distribution of this<br />\nliterature because the ideas presented are unpopular<br />\nwould indeed draw our vigorous editorial opposition.<br />\nHowever, we fail to see that the administration has enjoined the YS4 from free distribution and consequently<br />\nwill reserve comment until the dust clears and the issue<br />\ncrystalizes,<br /><br />\nIn a spurt of late Saturday<br />\nnight activity and architectural<br />\nimagination, the Adams House<br />\nHeavy<br />\nConstruction<br />\nSociety<br />\nerected the very first combination fallout shelter and Berlin<br />\nbarricade in the. world.
