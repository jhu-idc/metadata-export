Students from all over<br />\n<br />\nShaffer Each Day Keeps Your Psychoses Away<br />\nBy BOB SLOAN<br />\nLocated in the non-brick, nonGeorgian White House near the<br />\nFaculty Club, the Homewood Psychological ServicesClinic stands as<br />\na quiet harbor amidst the rough<br />\nseas of collegiate life.<br />\nUnder the direction of G. Wilson Shaffer, the clinic continues to<br />\nprovide short terms psycho-therapuetic services to hung-up Hoppies. With the aid of fifteen members of the Medical School faculty,<br />\nDr. Shaffer is able to run the clinic<br />\non a 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. basis, providing help for approximately 120<br />\nstudents. The clinic works on a<br />\nsystem whereby the student is<br />\ngiven a fixed number of appointments over a ten to twelve week<br />\nperiod; the fixed appointments<br />\nplan tends to make the patient become more open in his conversation, sooner, making help faster<br />\nand easier to obtain. If the consulting psychologist feels that the<br />\nstudent needs more help, he will<br />\nrecommend_a clinic or a local psychologist for the student to See.<br />\nThe services at Hopkins are free.<br />\nHopkins has provided the service since 1935, when Dr. Shaffer<br />\nconducted the clinic alone. At that<br />\ntime, he found the number of students seeking help to be small; the<br />\nincrease in numbers in the past decade or more Shaffer attributes to<br />\na number of causes. Since the Second World War, there has been a<br />\nnoted change, he said, in the public's feelings toward mental and<br />\nemotional illness. Seeking psychological help is a more accepted<br />\npractice today; it is no longer a<br />\ndisgrace. One seeks help in curing<br />\nmental or emotional illness just as<br />\nhe would in curing physical ailments.<br />\n<br />\nShaffer also acknowledged that<br />\nthe higher number of studen tsseeking assistance might be due to a<br />\nhigher level of anxiety in today's<br />\nworld than in previous years.<br />\n\"There has been a change in the<br />\nfamily as an organic unit ; it is no<br />\nlonger tightly knit.\" he observed.<br />\nThe fast Coln in unication of today, over greater distances, Plus<br />\nthe increased mobility of modern<br />\nyouth brought about by the car<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY 16, 1968<br />\n<br />\ntend to increase the possibility of<br />\nisolating and alienating the individual. \"The student today is hustled off to a place where nobody<br />\nknows him, where he finds himself pushed to do well, pushed to<br />\nmake up his mind. Modern education at Hopkins puts a premium on<br />\nexcellence,\" Shaffer continued,<br />\n\"and the student feels this pressure<br />\nto excel.\"<br />\nNevertheless, there is no one<br />\nspecific cause of mental or emotional problems. Reasons vary<br />\nfrom student to student; the psychologist must know the indivi-<br />\n<br />\ndual's background for his analysis,<br />\nnot simply the immediate causes<br />\nof the disturbance.<br />\nShaffer added that \"the new<br />\nsexual freedom has posed new psychological difficulties for young<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nSeveral students have expressed<br />\nregret that Hopkins, in spite of its<br />\nrelatively small undergraduate<br />\nbody, provokes psychological difficulties for students who don't<br />\nfit the standard issue for frat man<br />\nor quiet unassuming super-throat.<br />\n\"Nobody seems to give a good<br />\ngoddamn,\" bemoaned one student.<br />\n<br />\nthe nation will converge on the<br />\nstate to take over office function<br />\nso that New Hampshire McCarthy<br />\nsupporters can get out to talk to<br />\nthe people directly.

WHO'S PJK?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nP.J.K.'s critique of Chappaqua<br />\nwas petty and inane. It read as<br />\nthough he wanted to write something about the film, but not<br />\nknowing what to say, he decided<br />\nto pan it.<br />\nIf P.J.K. had known what was<br />\ngoing on in Chappaqua, he would<br />\nhave realized it was one of the<br />\nfinest films ever made. Rooks came<br />\nclose to putting down in film what<br />\nBurroughs achieved in Naked<br />\nLunch\u2014 - an exploration of a whole<br />\nspectrum of phenomena of the<br />\nhead, and through them, discovery<br />\nof the state of the human mind.<br />\nHe has taken slices of the generic<br />\nunconscious and seasoned them<br />\nwith a variety of drugs, capturing<br />\nbeautifully and magnifying naunces of time and mood, which are<br />\nalways there, but only few see.<br />\nThe stream of subconciousness<br />\nflow was beautiful. There was a<br />\ntremendous amount of subtle con-<br />\n<br />\nPerformance<br />\ndrop-in<br />\n<br />\ntinuity. In evaluating the dialog,<br />\none must remember that the film<br />\ncontains several simultaneous levels of meaning; that's also probably why P.J.K. was confused<br />\nabout Rooks' purposes. The dialog<br />\nwas loaded with smybolic connotations; the words were mind triggers - - part of a whole, no ordinary, literal conversation, If all<br />\nRooks' ideas were merely verbal,<br />\nhe wouldn't have needed film.<br />\nThe implication that Rooks was<br />\nmerely cashing in on the hippy<br />\nfad is ridiculous. The setting of<br />\nthe film was much closer to the<br />\nliterary beats, even to the N.Y.<br />\ncity Junkie world, than to hippies.<br />\nThe only thing in common with<br />\nhippies was LSD, which, in the<br />\ncontext of the film, isn't that<br />\nmuch. Finally, and prettiest of all,<br />\nthe criticism of the cameos was<br />\nirrelevant. They were disposed of<br />\nbefore the titles were through, and<br />\neven they served a purpose in<br />\n<br />\ntransition from mass images to the<br />\ncentral character's images at one<br />\nlevel of meaning.<br />\nOne of the critic's biggest attacks was on Rooks'ego. Someone<br />\nstrikes me as having an oversized<br />\nego when he assumes that because<br />\nhe doesn't understand something,<br />\nit's not understandable.

Koper<br />\n<br />\nRoger C. Toll<br />\n<br />\nEducation And The War<br />\nIt is unfortunate that in our society academic institutions so often<br />\nfind themselves in opposition to the government and its bureaucratic<br />\nprocesses. Traditionally, students especially find the motives and<br />\nmeans of government actions abhorrent, and through the eyes of an<br />\nidealistic intellectual, bureaucratic compromise and its tendency towards anti-intellectualism is as perverse and undermining as any thing<br />\nin our society.<br />\nRather than drawing closer together, the gulf between academia<br />\nand the government is ever-widening, largely because of the seemingly senseless and deathly effort in Vietnam. But recently another<br />\nmajor obstacle has come between the two spheres, an obstacle emanating from Washington which could prove catastrophic to the future<br />\nstate of American universities, especially to private universities such<br />\nas Hopkins.<br />\nLast year Congress passed a new draft law which, although insuring deferments for undergraduate students, will make it possible to<br />\ndraft all graduate students except those in certain chosen fields<br />\ndeemed vital to our national security, including dentistry and divinity, among a few others. The obvious danger is that graduate schools,<br />\nwhich today have become so vital in all fields, will be decimated, and<br />\nthat universities which depend so largely on grants for graduate studies and programs, will be severely hurt financially and academically.<br />\nThe genuine fear among university administrators became evident<br />\nas early as October last year, when the Association of American Universities of which Hopkins is a member, strongly criticized the new<br />\nlaw. At that time Harvard University President Nathan Pusey met<br />\nwith Robert McNamara, from whom he reportedly received a \"sympathetic\" hearing. But still nothing was done to reverse the decision,<br />\nwhich the National Security Council is supposed to act upon, and in<br />\nDecember Hopkins President Lincoln Gordon personally wrote letters of criticism to President Johnson, Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara<br />\nand many other Washington administrators involved in the NSC. According to Dr. Gordon's office, no direct action has been taken in<br />\nresponse to his letters, but he has had some \"sympathetic\" response.<br />\nThe confusion caused by the hasty law is considerable on both<br />\nsides..The Pentagon would naturally rather have 18 and 19 year olds<br />\nwho are more easily molded into military form and who are less likely<br />\nto cause dissension in the ranks as graduate students would. President<br />\nfears that the law,if enforced, will lead to more militant anti-war and<br />\nanti-draft protests just prior to the 1968 election. On the other side,<br />\nthe universities are confused in a number of ways. For instance, how<br />\nmuch money should be budgeted for the French department if there<br />\nwill be half the number of graduate students next year as there are<br />\nthis year. How should selection procedures and criteria be determined<br />\nif over half of the most eligible candidates for graduate school will be<br />\ndrafted. And won't departments suffer if, as one Hopkins administrator said, the graduate school is comprised solely of \"old fogeys and<br />\nyoung girls.\" The problems facing the university are grave indeed.<br />\nand prospective graduate students as well as the academic departments are resigned to a serious and perhaps critical guessing game of<br />\nwhat Washington will decide to do.<br />\nThe most immediate problem is how and with what program to<br />\nreplace the present policy. President Pusey has suggested a lottery<br />\nsystem, much discussed a year ago, in which all males, students and<br />\nnon-students alike, under the age of 62 would take the same chance<br />\nof being drafted. Democratically, this is commendable, for non-students should not have to do the dirty work for those males privileged<br />\nenough to go to college. Nevertheless, and admittedly selfishly, college students are an elite and they will soon be performing the most<br />\nvital functions in our society; perhaps they should be deferred. According to military experts as well, the best soldier is not the most intelligent. A lottery system, also, would not alleviate the guessing<br />\ngame syndrome which graduate and undergraduate schools, as well as<br />\nstudents, would be faced with.<br />\nFor the most part, Congressmen are beginning to press the President for some action in changing the law. Many people are also pressing the NSC to take its action, one way or the other, so that students<br />\nand graduate schools will know definitely what to expect next year.<br />\nNevertheless, as James Reston said in the New York Times on Sunday,\"Congress in general seems to be in a mood to leave the law as it<br />\nis to 'correct' and even to punish graduate students for the special<br />\nprivileges they have enjoyed in the past.\" We might add that the<br />\nmood is one more example of the anti-intellectualism so often found<br />\nin Washington, especially among such men as Mendel Rivers and<br />\nRichard Russell.<br />\nThe outlook is bleak for graduate schools, students and<br />\nhigher<br />\neducation in general in the next few years. It has been estimated<br />\nthat<br />\nup to two-thirds of the 185,000 June graduates this year<br />\nwill be in<br />\nthe armed services next year, with a large proportion of those<br />\nnecessarily in Vietnam. It has also been estimated that next year's graduate<br />\nschools will be decimated up to 50 per cent of their present number<br />\nof students. In the face of such danger to Hopkins, as well as to other<br />\nuniversities, the entire academic community is obliged to take any<br />\nand every step necessary to stop the Washington bureaucracy from<br />\nbringing a very possible crisis to this and every other university.<br />\nWhile on this subject, it is significant to bring up one more<br />\nexample of the prevailing tendency in Washington to put higher<br />\neducation<br />\nnear the bottom of the ever present list of priorities. In a<br />\nstatement<br />\nlast week, President Johnson, in characteristic political<br />\nstyle, cut<br />\nfederal support of higher education by nearly one half.<br />\nIt is a fine<br />\nand dramatic example of just how seriously and deeply the<br />\nVietnam<br />\neffort has cut into this country's most vital sphere.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 16, 1968<br />\n<br />\nCrime-Time Viewing<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nEvery seeker of public office the only one who profits from<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nneeds<br />\na song particularly adapted crime.

There is a certain type of<br />\npolitical analyst in America (Max<br />\nAscoli of The Reporter is a good<br />\nexample) that has, in the face of<br />\nall evidence,classified Robert Kennedy, who has never taken a forthright position in opposition to the<br />\nwar, as the hero of the New Left<br />\n(thus falling into the trap of equating the style of Kennedy's \"youthful\" appeal to a substantive appeal<br />\nto the young radicals: the same<br />\nsort of trap - - mistaking style for<br />\nsubstance - - that men like Ascoli<br />\njustly condemn in analyzing John<br />\nKennedy). I suppose it is inevitable<br />\nthat having thus thoroughly misapprehended what one leading<br />\n<br />\njournal calls the \"Bobby phonomerlon,\" men like these will proceed to butcher their discussion of<br />\nMcCarthy beyond recall.

Romney, it is generally conceded,can win only if he<br />\ncan sweep the primaries, yet the<br />\nsame commentators who take seriously the possibility that Romney might succeed in doing so dismiss out of hand the possibility<br />\nthat McCarthy might succeed in<br />\nthe same way. The problem is not<br />\nthat McCarthy hasn't a chance in<br />\nthe primaries but that even a victory in the primaries would probably not suffice. Yet to understand what McCarthy's candidacy<br />\nmeans one must appreciate the<br />\nproblems he faces in the primaries.<br />\n1) After a good deal of rather<br />\nshortsighted hesitation, McCarthy has finally decided to go into New Hampshire, a must if he<br />\nis to be taken seriously. New<br />\nHampshire is a strange state,<br />\none that in twenty years has<br />\nproduced two remarkable upsets (Kefauver in 1952 and<br />\nLodge in 1964); it is, further,<br />\na state in which anti-war and<br />\npro-Johnson sentiment are<br />\nabout equally weak. McCarthy<br />\nclaimed to be very much encouraged by his first venture<br />\ninto the state, but it is widely<br />\nbelieved that even though the<br />\nJohnson forces are depending<br />\non a write-in campaign mounted by stand-ins, McCarthy will<br />\nbe swamped. He desperately<br />\nneeds a good showing, but he<br />\ndoes not seem quite to appreciate that fact.<br />\n2) In Massachusetts the Johnson forces face a serious predicament. IfJ ohnson himself runs<br />\nin Massachusetts, he may very<br />\nwell lose, and in any case endanger his position. He could<br />\nrun a stand-in, but the ideal<br />\nstand-in, Edward Kennedy, is<br />\nunwilling to run, and the alternative candidates \u2014 Speaker of<br />\nthe House McCormick and Postmaster General O'Brien \u2014 might<br />\nwell lose to McCarthy.<br />\n3) Nebraska is a deeply conservative state. McCarthy would<br />\nnot enter the primary there if<br />\nthe state laws did not require it<br />\nof all candidates. A victory in<br />\nNebraska would provide the<br />\nsort of tonic Kennedy got when<br />\nhe won in West Virginia in<br />\n1960, but few things could be<br />\nless likely.<br />\n4) Wisconsin, Oregon, and California are all liberally oriented<br />\nstates where McCarthy has a<br />\nreal chance. Oregon has elected<br />\ntwo bitterly anti-war Senators<br />\n(Morse and Hatfield). Wisconsin, the home of Progressivism<br />\nin the 1920's, is sympathetic to<br />\nMcCarthy's position.

The second half will<br />\nbe published next week.<br />\nJanuary 15, 1968<br />\nThe Honorable John W. Gardner<br />\nSecretary of Health, Education<br />\nand Welfare<br />\nDear John:<br />\nMy colleagues and I have become seriously concerned by the<br />\nabsence thus far of any new definition of Selective Service policy<br />\nas it affects graduate students. As<br />\nyou know, representations on this<br />\nmatter were made in November on<br />\nbehalf of the Association of American Universities. On December<br />\n19, on hearing that the question<br />\nwas soon to be considered in the<br />\nNational Security Council, I wrote<br />\ndirectly to the President, as indicated in the enclosed copy.<br />\nI understand, however, that no<br />\ndecision has yet been taken to alter current regulations. While this<br />\nstatus quo would avoid discriminatory treatment among disciplines<br />\n(discussed as the first issue in my<br />\nDecember 19 letter), it would do<br />\nnothing to correct the age-group<br />\nproblem. As of this coming summer, therefore, all new college<br />\ngraduates and students completing<br />\ntheir first year of graduate work,<br />\nexcept for those in the health professions, would be eligible for military call-up, with the older age<br />\ngroups being called first. This<br />\nleaves unaltered the dangerous<br />\nprospect of massive depopulation<br />\nof first and second-year graduate<br />\nenrollments in all American universities, at least for the next two<br />\nyears until a reflow of veterans can<br />\nbe expected.<br />\nThis problem is of special concern to universities like Johns<br />\nHopkins which have their major<br />\neducational commitment to programs at the graduate, professional, and post-doctoral levels. To assist its consideration within the<br />\nGovernment, it may be helpful for<br />\nyou to know what we foresee as<br />\nthe quantitative and qualitative<br />\nimpact on our own programs,<br />\nWhich should be representative of<br />\nhigh-quality post-graduate education generally.<br />\nSince the health professions are<br />\ngiven automatic deferment by statute, we have omitted from this review our Schools of Medicine and<br />\nof Public Health,and concentrated<br />\non our Division of Arts and Sciences and our School of Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies.<br />\nAmong our 380 present firstYear graduate students in Arts and<br />\nSciences(comprising natural sciences, social sciences, engineering,<br />\nand humanities), about 30 percent<br />\nare women and foreign nationals;<br />\na small number are veterans; and<br />\nabout 8 percent are physically unfit for military service. We have no<br />\nreason to assume different proportions in a normal entering class for<br />\nnext year, whose total size has<br />\nbeen projected at 420(in line with<br />\nour capacity in terms of faculty<br />\nand space.)<br />\nAs a round figure, therefore,<br />\nwe could expect upwards of 50<br />\nPercent of present first-year students to be drafted, along with 50<br />\npercent of the normal qualified<br />\napplicant group for next year. If<br />\nno offsetting steps were taken, this<br />\nwould reduce our 1968-69 total<br />\ngraduate enrollment in Arts and<br />\nSciences by 400 students(out of a<br />\nnormal of about 1,550.)<br />\n:the gross financial impact<br />\nwould be a loss of tuition revenue<br />\nof $2,000 per student,or $800,000<br />\nThis would be partly offset by<br />\n<br />\nsavings in financial aid to students<br />\nfrom general university funds; we<br />\nestimate the residual net impact at<br />\nabout $550,000.<br />\nThis is a very important sum in<br />\nour overall financial picture. While<br />\nthe total annual budget for Arts<br />\nand Sciences(including undergraduate as well as post-graduate and<br />\npost-doctoral training, which are<br />\nhandled by the same faculty)<br />\namounts to about $25 million, the<br />\ncore of irreducible commitments,<br />\nmainly for faculty salaries, is in our<br />\ncategory entitled \"Instruction and<br />\nNon-sponsored Research.\" Last<br />\nyear, this item amounted to $4.6<br />\nmillion, financed as follows: from<br />\ntuition, $3.7 million; from endowment income, $0.5 million; and<br />\nfrom current gifts, $0.4 million. A<br />\nnet tuition loss of $550,000,therefore,amounts to 12 percent of our<br />\ncore expenditures and is more than<br />\nwe have been able to allocate in<br />\nnormal years from either endowment income or from current gifts.<br />\nThere are no obvious alternative<br />\nsources to replace such lost income. In fact, this new financial<br />\n<br />\nloss would come on top of the reductions now being experienced<br />\nin federal support for fellowships,<br />\ntraining,and research. At the same<br />\ntime, the Ford Foundation has recently announced a more conservative policy of assistance to private universities. This is a period of<br />\n<br />\nextreme financial stringency for<br />\nall of us, caught as we are between<br />\nthese reductions in important sources of funding at a time when both<br />\noperating and iconstruction costs<br />\nare continuing to rise much more<br />\nrapidly than the general cost of<br />\nliving.<br />\n<br />\nApart from its financial impact,<br />\nthe loss of half the normal complement of first and second year<br />\ngraduate students would have severely unfavorable effects on undergraduate teaching arrangements<br />\nand teaching quality.

A center both of the<br />\nNew Left and of the radical<br />\nRight, it is probably McCarthy's<br />\nbest chance. (It now appears<br />\nthat an independent group, the<br />\nPeace and Freedom Party, will<br />\nappear on the ballot in California; good though this may be<br />\nfor the long term needs of The<br />\n<br />\nMovement, it will divert funds<br />\nand energies from the McCarthy<br />\neffort.)<br />\nSo McCarthy may triumph in<br />\nthe primaries but unless he can get<br />\nan organizational base in the party,<br />\nit is not likely to matter. Until<br />\nMcCarthy can get men like Seantors McGovern and Tydings behind him, he will not have a real<br />\n<br />\nchance. But the McGoverns and<br />\nTydings behind him, he will not<br />\njoin the McCarthy campaign until<br />\nthey are convinced he has a chance,<br />\nand he won't have a chance until<br />\nthey joint him.<br />\nThere is one and only one way<br />\nto break that deadlock. An inspirational campaign might, in the<br />\nAmerica of 1968, really catch the<br />\n<br />\npopular,spirit and imagination, and<br />\nlaunch the sort of popular crusade<br />\nthat alone would attract the \"respectable\" moderates, partisans of<br />\nthe stagnant center that stifles<br />\nAmerican politics, to his banner.<br />\nUnfortunately, McCarthy, though<br />\nhe has the potential, has not yet<br />\nplayed the role. His campaign has<br />\nbeen lackluster and uninspired. He<br />\n<br />\neyour Ito\u00b0<br />\nw growlog<br />\ncoospatile<br />\ntie<br />\n300<br />\n<br />\nhas made curious statements that<br />\ncontradict the tenor of his effort<br />\n(we must be prepared to \"draw the<br />\nline\" in Thialand; even after peace<br />\nwe may retain troops in Vietnam<br />\nfor years). What other people call<br />\ncynical Realpolitic McCarthy has<br />\ntrumpeted in the name of morality.<br />\n\"We must raise the essential moral<br />\nquestion as to whether or not there<br />\nis a proper balance in what we may<br />\ngain in what is projected as victory, in contrast with the loss of<br />\nlife, the loss of material goods, the<br />\nloss of moral integrity and moral<br />\nenergy which goes with this effort.\" Superficially eloquent, and<br />\nplausible as a pragamatic appeal,<br />\nthat statement, as a moral call to<br />\narms, does not ring true. Once or<br />\ntwice McCarthy has been able to<br />\nsynthesize the ight sense of urgency and conviction, but his campaign so far has been strikingly<br />\nlack-luster.<br />\nYet one is distressed by the<br />\ntendency of the peace movement<br />\nto dismiss McCarthy's move as a<br />\nuseless gesture. For those who<br />\nwant to end the war now, McCarthy is the only hope, however<br />\nfrail. It is as irrelevant as it is true,<br />\nthat a McCarthy victory could set<br />\nback the long term goals of The<br />\nMovement, which needs an Independent political thrust, those(and<br />\nthere are many)who conclude that<br />\nto preserve our \"purity\" we must<br />\nkeep hands off McCarthy are guilty of putting the peace movement,<br />\nand their own intellectual pride,<br />\nabove peace.

Hairy, Diseased beings that may eventaully<br />\nbreak loose in all of us. There are<br />\nthe family of psychoses, the four<br />\neyed schizophrenia, the unpredictable manic- depressive.: the sullen<br />\nand gloomy paranoia, and others<br />\nunpronounceable. There are also<br />\nthe subconcious cell and hobnob<br />\nabout in the occipital district. Dr.<br />\nFrank has enough problems dealing<br />\nwith these vile creatures in the individual human mind. However, it<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nis when he discovers animals of the<br />\nlast sort in the mind of a nation,<br />\nthen, he as well as all of us, have<br />\nproblems.<br />\nProfessional ethics, being as<br />\nthey are induced him to write on<br />\nthe subject, and his book, Sanity<br />\nand Survival: Psychological Aspects of War and Peace, was released Thursday, and is available in<br />\nthe Hopkins bookstore.<br />\nDr. Frank's thesis is that nations are not necessarily neurotic<br />\nbut that today nations tend to<br />\nsolve their problems in the manner<br />\nthat a neurotic individual would.<br />\nThat is to say, this nation is attempting to solve its problems by<br />\nmeans that were successful in the<br />\nage of conventional weapons, but<br />\nis not succeeding in the age of nuclear weapons.

It<br />\nis his opinion that our goals have<br />\nshifted from the tangible \u2014 the elimination of the Communist powers, to the intangible \u2014 a justification of our insistence to defend<br />\nSoutheast Asia. These characteristics are also evident in a neurotic<br />\nindividual, according to Dr. Frank<br />\n\u2014 that this individual will try to<br />\njustify old mistakes by making new<br />\nmistakes. This country feels it<br />\nmust keep sending -money and<br />\ntroops in to prove that we were<br />\nright in the first place.<br />\nFrank further says that there<br />\nare two types of wars, territorial<br />\nand ideological. Territorial wars<br />\nend when the territory has been<br />\nconquered, but ideological wars<br />\nare fought until the opposing ideology has been eliminated. It is his<br />\nopinion that we find ourselves in<br />\nthis ideological kind of war, from<br />\nwhich we may not be able to extricate ourselves. The North Vietnamese, he asserts, are in the same<br />\n<br />\nposition as well.<br />\n\u2022 The individual leaders of certain nations have shown sehility at<br />\ntimes by not being able to function normally. Among those used<br />\nas examples are Wilson in his last<br />\nterm and Roosevelt at Yalta.<br />\nInvolved also is the fact that<br />\nscience is moving too fast for the<br />\naverage man to keep abreast of the<br />\npossible benefits, as well as the<br />\npossible dangers. Dr. Frank claims<br />\nthat we have to adjust to 25 years<br />\nof changes that our forebearers<br />\nhad 2500 years to adjust to. The<br />\narms race, a defense system, mass<br />\ncommunications, all of these are<br />\nperplexing to the fragile human<br />\nanimal.<br />\nBut the point that Dr. Frank<br />\nwishes to make is that changes in<br />\nthis world can be adjusted to if<br />\nwe are given enough time. He is<br />\nhopeful about the United Nations,<br />\nthe International Geophysical<br />\nYear, mass communications, and<br />\nmass air transport. Also encouraging is that no war has been fought<br />\nto conclusion since the second<br />\nworld war.

In addition, surveys have found Negro<br />\nvoting power is crippled because<br />\nthe likelihood of voting is inversely<br />\nat?<br />\ncorrelated with the age of the<br />\nvoter.<br />\nIn contrast, Baltimore's white<br />\nPopulation regularly demonstrates<br />\nhigh turn-out, and the median<br />\nage of the white citizen is higher.<br />\nAnother factor in the lack of<br />\nNegro voting power in the city is<br />\nunderregistration. Of the 118 NC-,<br />\n<br />\ngro precincts sampled on January<br />\n1, 1966, only 21.5% of the voters<br />\nwere registered, as opposed to<br />\n47.2% of the whites in 260 precincts sampled.<br />\nBack to Lincoln<br />\nThese conditions are aggravated<br />\nby the registrational traits of the<br />\nNegroes who do vote. In Baltimore, which approximates Southern patterns, Negroes register in<br />\nhigher percentages in G.O.P. ranks<br />\nthan do white voters. This trend<br />\nhas been precipitated by the distinct, latently strong kindship of<br />\nthe Republicans as the party of<br />\nLincoln.<br />\nLoevy asserted that the Negro<br />\ntends to vote only at the top of<br />\nthe ticket, that is, for the first one<br />\nor two offices that appear on the<br />\nballot. He rarely votes on bond issues and questions, which are further down the ballot. Moreover, a.<br />\nviable two-party system does not<br />\nexist in Baltimore as legislature and<br />\nCity Council are basically Democratic.<br />\nLoevy saw hope for Negro progress in the political arena if, like<br />\npast minority groups, they followed the \"long tenement trail.\" He<br />\ncited the one-bloc vote of Irish<br />\nCatholics, who have become powers in Democratic Party organizations.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE THIRTEEN<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 16, 1968<br />\n<br />\nThe administration's present<br />\nplans call for \"new appointments<br />\nin such areas as chemical physics<br />\nof surfaces, electrode processes,<br />\nheterogeneous catalysis, statistical<br />\nmechanics of liquids and biomedical engineering.\"<br />\nSeveral graduate students denounced this move as \"tokenism\"<br />\nand claimed that the \"heart of<br />\nchemical 'engineering was being<br />\neliminated.\" They accused the administration of slowly trying to<br />\neliminate engineering as a discipline at the University, particularly in those fields where more applied sciences were involved.<br />\nThe subjects which the University pin-pointed, are all considered<br />\nperipheral to the chemical engineer.

Failing that, the very best you can do is to<br />\nmake morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is<br />\npossible if you will follow three simple rules:<br />\n1. Shave properly.<br />\nBy shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don't use<br />\na blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time<br />\nof clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor<br />\nangs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no<br />\nsqueak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on<br />\nyour lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna<br />\nSuper Stainless Steel Blades.<br />\nI have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive<br />\nuntil one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here<br />\nto tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not<br />\nonly shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old virtues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Personna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna<br />\ndoes not rasp and tug, yelling, \"Hey, lookit me!\" No, sir,<br />\nnot Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Personna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It<br />\nshucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.<br />\nWhy, you hardly know it's there, this well-bred Personna<br />\nblade, this paragon of punctilio.<br />\nMoreover, this crown of the blade-maker's art, this<br />\nepitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Doubleedge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get<br />\nsome.<br />\n2. Breakfast properly.<br />\nI assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible<br />\nshaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, bracing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the<br />\nhideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an<br />\nample breakfast.<br />\nTake,for example,the ease of Basil Metabolism, a sophomore al. V.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspection by the Commandant one morning, prepared by storing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would<br />\nnot sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of<br />\neggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,<br />\na swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a<br />\nthatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.<br />\n<br />\nThe idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When<br />\nthe Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that<br />\nhe could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He<br />\nwas, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today,<br />\na perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander<br />\nin Cleveland.<br />\n3. Read properlb.<br />\nAlways read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.<br />\nBut do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acidmaking news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper\u2014<br />\nthe Home and Garden section, for example.<br />\nFor instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant,<br />\nthere is a delightful column called \"Ask Harry Homespun\" which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and<br />\nmany an earthy chuckle.

Wilson Shaffer, the clinic continues to<br />\nprovide short terms psycho-therapuetic services to hung-up Hoppies. With the aid of fifteen members of the Medical School faculty,<br />\nDr. Shaffer is able to run the clinic<br />\non a 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. basis, providing help for approximately 120<br />\nstudents. The clinic works on a<br />\nsystem whereby the student is<br />\ngiven a fixed number of appointments over a ten to twelve week<br />\nperiod; the fixed appointments<br />\nplan tends to make the patient become more open in his conversation, sooner, making help faster<br />\nand easier to obtain. If the consulting psychologist feels that the<br />\nstudent needs more help, he will<br />\nrecommend_a clinic or a local psychologist for the student to See.<br />\nThe services at Hopkins are free.<br />\nHopkins has provided the service since 1935, when Dr. Shaffer<br />\nconducted the clinic alone. At that<br />\ntime, he found the number of students seeking help to be small; the<br />\nincrease in numbers in the past decade or more Shaffer attributes to<br />\na number of causes. Since the Second World War, there has been a<br />\nnoted change, he said, in the public's feelings toward mental and<br />\nemotional illness. Seeking psychological help is a more accepted<br />\npractice today; it is no longer a<br />\ndisgrace. One seeks help in curing<br />\nmental or emotional illness just as<br />\nhe would in curing physical ailments.<br /><br />\nShaffer also acknowledged that<br />\nthe higher number of studen tsseeking assistance might be due to a<br />\nhigher level of anxiety in today's<br />\nworld than in previous years.<br />\n\"There has been a change in the<br />\nfamily as an organic unit ; it is no<br />\nlonger tightly knit.\" he observed.<br />\nThe fast Coln in unication of today, over greater distances, Plus<br />\nthe increased mobility of modern<br />\nyouth brought about by the car<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY 16, 1968<br /><br />\ntend to increase the possibility of<br />\nisolating and alienating the individual. \"The student today is hustled off to a place where nobody<br />\nknows him, where he finds himself pushed to do well, pushed to<br />\nmake up his mind. Modern education at Hopkins puts a premium on<br />\nexcellence,\" Shaffer continued,<br />\n\"and the student feels this pressure<br />\nto excel.\"<br />\nNevertheless, there is no one<br />\nspecific cause of mental or emotional problems. Reasons vary<br />\nfrom student to student; the psychologist must know the indivi-<br /><br />\ndual's background for his analysis,<br />\nnot simply the immediate causes<br />\nof the disturbance.<br />\nShaffer added that \"the new<br />\nsexual freedom has posed new psychological difficulties for young<br />\npeople.\"<br />\nSeveral students have expressed<br />\nregret that Hopkins, in spite of its<br />\nrelatively small undergraduate<br />\nbody, provokes psychological difficulties for students who don't<br />\nfit the standard issue for frat man<br />\nor quiet unassuming super-throat.<br />\n\"Nobody seems to give a good<br />\ngoddamn,\" bemoaned one student.<br /><br />\nthe nation will converge on the<br />\nstate to take over office function<br />\nso that New Hampshire McCarthy<br />\nsupporters can get out to talk to<br />\nthe people directly.

WHO'S PJK?<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nP.J.K.'s critique of Chappaqua<br />\nwas petty and inane. It read as<br />\nthough he wanted to write something about the film, but not<br />\nknowing what to say, he decided<br />\nto pan it.<br />\nIf P.J.K. had known what was<br />\ngoing on in Chappaqua, he would<br />\nhave realized it was one of the<br />\nfinest films ever made. Rooks came<br />\nclose to putting down in film what<br />\nBurroughs achieved in Naked<br />\nLunch\u2014 - an exploration of a whole<br />\nspectrum of phenomena of the<br />\nhead, and through them, discovery<br />\nof the state of the human mind.<br />\nHe has taken slices of the generic<br />\nunconscious and seasoned them<br />\nwith a variety of drugs, capturing<br />\nbeautifully and magnifying naunces of time and mood, which are<br />\nalways there, but only few see.<br />\nThe stream of subconciousness<br />\nflow was beautiful. There was a<br />\ntremendous amount of subtle con-<br /><br />\nPerformance<br />\ndrop-in<br /><br />\ntinuity. In evaluating the dialog,<br />\none must remember that the film<br />\ncontains several simultaneous levels of meaning; that's also probably why P.J.K. was confused<br />\nabout Rooks' purposes. The dialog<br />\nwas loaded with smybolic connotations; the words were mind triggers - - part of a whole, no ordinary, literal conversation, If all<br />\nRooks' ideas were merely verbal,<br />\nhe wouldn't have needed film.<br />\nThe implication that Rooks was<br />\nmerely cashing in on the hippy<br />\nfad is ridiculous. The setting of<br />\nthe film was much closer to the<br />\nliterary beats, even to the N.Y.<br />\ncity Junkie world, than to hippies.<br />\nThe only thing in common with<br />\nhippies was LSD, which, in the<br />\ncontext of the film, isn't that<br />\nmuch. Finally, and prettiest of all,<br />\nthe criticism of the cameos was<br />\nirrelevant. They were disposed of<br />\nbefore the titles were through, and<br />\neven they served a purpose in<br /><br />\ntransition from mass images to the<br />\ncentral character's images at one<br />\nlevel of meaning.<br />\nOne of the critic's biggest attacks was on Rooks'ego.

Koper<br /><br />\nRoger C. Toll<br /><br />\nEducation And The War<br />\nIt is unfortunate that in our society academic institutions so often<br />\nfind themselves in opposition to the government and its bureaucratic<br />\nprocesses. Traditionally, students especially find the motives and<br />\nmeans of government actions abhorrent, and through the eyes of an<br />\nidealistic intellectual, bureaucratic compromise and its tendency towards anti-intellectualism is as perverse and undermining as any thing<br />\nin our society.<br />\nRather than drawing closer together, the gulf between academia<br />\nand the government is ever-widening, largely because of the seemingly senseless and deathly effort in Vietnam. But recently another<br />\nmajor obstacle has come between the two spheres, an obstacle emanating from Washington which could prove catastrophic to the future<br />\nstate of American universities, especially to private universities such<br />\nas Hopkins.<br />\nLast year Congress passed a new draft law which, although insuring deferments for undergraduate students, will make it possible to<br />\ndraft all graduate students except those in certain chosen fields<br />\ndeemed vital to our national security, including dentistry and divinity, among a few others. The obvious danger is that graduate schools,<br />\nwhich today have become so vital in all fields, will be decimated, and<br />\nthat universities which depend so largely on grants for graduate studies and programs, will be severely hurt financially and academically.<br />\nThe genuine fear among university administrators became evident<br />\nas early as October last year, when the Association of American Universities of which Hopkins is a member, strongly criticized the new<br />\nlaw. At that time Harvard University President Nathan Pusey met<br />\nwith Robert McNamara, from whom he reportedly received a \"sympathetic\" hearing. But still nothing was done to reverse the decision,<br />\nwhich the National Security Council is supposed to act upon, and in<br />\nDecember Hopkins President Lincoln Gordon personally wrote letters of criticism to President Johnson, Dean Rusk, Robert McNamara<br />\nand many other Washington administrators involved in the NSC. According to Dr. Gordon's office, no direct action has been taken in<br />\nresponse to his letters, but he has had some \"sympathetic\" response.<br />\nThe confusion caused by the hasty law is considerable on both<br />\nsides..The Pentagon would naturally rather have 18 and 19 year olds<br />\nwho are more easily molded into military form and who are less likely<br />\nto cause dissension in the ranks as graduate students would. President<br />\nfears that the law,if enforced, will lead to more militant anti-war and<br />\nanti-draft protests just prior to the 1968 election. On the other side,<br />\nthe universities are confused in a number of ways. For instance, how<br />\nmuch money should be budgeted for the French department if there<br />\nwill be half the number of graduate students next year as there are<br />\nthis year. How should selection procedures and criteria be determined<br />\nif over half of the most eligible candidates for graduate school will be<br />\ndrafted. And won't departments suffer if, as one Hopkins administrator said, the graduate school is comprised solely of \"old fogeys and<br />\nyoung girls.\" The problems facing the university are grave indeed.<br />\nand prospective graduate students as well as the academic departments are resigned to a serious and perhaps critical guessing game of<br />\nwhat Washington will decide to do.<br />\nThe most immediate problem is how and with what program to<br />\nreplace the present policy. President Pusey has suggested a lottery<br />\nsystem, much discussed a year ago, in which all males, students and<br />\nnon-students alike, under the age of 62 would take the same chance<br />\nof being drafted. Democratically, this is commendable, for non-students should not have to do the dirty work for those males privileged<br />\nenough to go to college. Nevertheless, and admittedly selfishly, college students are an elite and they will soon be performing the most<br />\nvital functions in our society; perhaps they should be deferred. According to military experts as well, the best soldier is not the most intelligent. A lottery system, also, would not alleviate the guessing<br />\ngame syndrome which graduate and undergraduate schools, as well as<br />\nstudents, would be faced with.<br />\nFor the most part, Congressmen are beginning to press the President for some action in changing the law. Many people are also pressing the NSC to take its action, one way or the other, so that students<br />\nand graduate schools will know definitely what to expect next year.<br />\nNevertheless, as James Reston said in the New York Times on Sunday,\"Congress in general seems to be in a mood to leave the law as it<br />\nis to 'correct' and even to punish graduate students for the special<br />\nprivileges they have enjoyed in the past.\" We might add that the<br />\nmood is one more example of the anti-intellectualism so often found<br />\nin Washington, especially among such men as Mendel Rivers and<br />\nRichard Russell.<br />\nThe outlook is bleak for graduate schools, students and<br />\nhigher<br />\neducation in general in the next few years. It has been estimated<br />\nthat<br />\nup to two-thirds of the 185,000 June graduates this year<br />\nwill be in<br />\nthe armed services next year, with a large proportion of those<br />\nnecessarily in Vietnam. It has also been estimated that next year's graduate<br />\nschools will be decimated up to 50 per cent of their present number<br />\nof students. In the face of such danger to Hopkins, as well as to other<br />\nuniversities, the entire academic community is obliged to take any<br />\nand every step necessary to stop the Washington bureaucracy from<br />\nbringing a very possible crisis to this and every other university.<br />\nWhile on this subject, it is significant to bring up one more<br />\nexample of the prevailing tendency in Washington to put higher<br />\neducation<br />\nnear the bottom of the ever present list of priorities. In a<br />\nstatement<br />\nlast week, President Johnson, in characteristic political<br />\nstyle, cut<br />\nfederal support of higher education by nearly one half.<br />\nIt is a fine<br />\nand dramatic example of just how seriously and deeply the<br />\nVietnam<br />\neffort has cut into this country's most vital sphere.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 16, 1968<br /><br />\nCrime-Time Viewing<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nEvery seeker of public office the only one who profits from<br />\nBy SETH FELDMAN<br />\nneeds<br />\na song particularly adapted crime.

There is a certain type of<br />\npolitical analyst in America (Max<br />\nAscoli of The Reporter is a good<br />\nexample) that has, in the face of<br />\nall evidence,classified Robert Kennedy, who has never taken a forthright position in opposition to the<br />\nwar, as the hero of the New Left<br />\n(thus falling into the trap of equating the style of Kennedy's \"youthful\" appeal to a substantive appeal<br />\nto the young radicals: the same<br />\nsort of trap - - mistaking style for<br />\nsubstance - - that men like Ascoli<br />\njustly condemn in analyzing John<br />\nKennedy). I suppose it is inevitable<br />\nthat having thus thoroughly misapprehended what one leading<br /><br />\njournal calls the \"Bobby phonomerlon,\" men like these will proceed to butcher their discussion of<br />\nMcCarthy beyond recall.

Romney, it is generally conceded,can win only if he<br />\ncan sweep the primaries, yet the<br />\nsame commentators who take seriously the possibility that Romney might succeed in doing so dismiss out of hand the possibility<br />\nthat McCarthy might succeed in<br />\nthe same way. The problem is not<br />\nthat McCarthy hasn't a chance in<br />\nthe primaries but that even a victory in the primaries would probably not suffice. Yet to understand what McCarthy's candidacy<br />\nmeans one must appreciate the<br />\nproblems he faces in the primaries.<br />\n1) After a good deal of rather<br />\nshortsighted hesitation, McCarthy has finally decided to go into New Hampshire, a must if he<br />\nis to be taken seriously. New<br />\nHampshire is a strange state,<br />\none that in twenty years has<br />\nproduced two remarkable upsets (Kefauver in 1952 and<br />\nLodge in 1964); it is, further,<br />\na state in which anti-war and<br />\npro-Johnson sentiment are<br />\nabout equally weak. McCarthy<br />\nclaimed to be very much encouraged by his first venture<br />\ninto the state, but it is widely<br />\nbelieved that even though the<br />\nJohnson forces are depending<br />\non a write-in campaign mounted by stand-ins, McCarthy will<br />\nbe swamped. He desperately<br />\nneeds a good showing, but he<br />\ndoes not seem quite to appreciate that fact.<br />\n2) In Massachusetts the Johnson forces face a serious predicament. IfJ ohnson himself runs<br />\nin Massachusetts, he may very<br />\nwell lose, and in any case endanger his position. He could<br />\nrun a stand-in, but the ideal<br />\nstand-in, Edward Kennedy, is<br />\nunwilling to run, and the alternative candidates \u2014 Speaker of<br />\nthe House McCormick and Postmaster General O'Brien \u2014 might<br />\nwell lose to McCarthy.<br />\n3) Nebraska is a deeply conservative state. McCarthy would<br />\nnot enter the primary there if<br />\nthe state laws did not require it<br />\nof all candidates. A victory in<br />\nNebraska would provide the<br />\nsort of tonic Kennedy got when<br />\nhe won in West Virginia in<br />\n1960, but few things could be<br />\nless likely.<br />\n4) Wisconsin, Oregon, and California are all liberally oriented<br />\nstates where McCarthy has a<br />\nreal chance. Oregon has elected<br />\ntwo bitterly anti-war Senators<br />\n(Morse and Hatfield). Wisconsin, the home of Progressivism<br />\nin the 1920's, is sympathetic to<br />\nMcCarthy's position.

As of this coming summer, therefore, all new college<br />\ngraduates and students completing<br />\ntheir first year of graduate work,<br />\nexcept for those in the health professions, would be eligible for military call-up, with the older age<br />\ngroups being called first. This<br />\nleaves unaltered the dangerous<br />\nprospect of massive depopulation<br />\nof first and second-year graduate<br />\nenrollments in all American universities, at least for the next two<br />\nyears until a reflow of veterans can<br />\nbe expected.<br />\nThis problem is of special concern to universities like Johns<br />\nHopkins which have their major<br />\neducational commitment to programs at the graduate, professional, and post-doctoral levels. To assist its consideration within the<br />\nGovernment, it may be helpful for<br />\nyou to know what we foresee as<br />\nthe quantitative and qualitative<br />\nimpact on our own programs,<br />\nWhich should be representative of<br />\nhigh-quality post-graduate education generally.<br />\nSince the health professions are<br />\ngiven automatic deferment by statute, we have omitted from this review our Schools of Medicine and<br />\nof Public Health,and concentrated<br />\non our Division of Arts and Sciences and our School of Advanced<br />\nInternational Studies.<br />\nAmong our 380 present firstYear graduate students in Arts and<br />\nSciences(comprising natural sciences, social sciences, engineering,<br />\nand humanities), about 30 percent<br />\nare women and foreign nationals;<br />\na small number are veterans; and<br />\nabout 8 percent are physically unfit for military service. We have no<br />\nreason to assume different proportions in a normal entering class for<br />\nnext year, whose total size has<br />\nbeen projected at 420(in line with<br />\nour capacity in terms of faculty<br />\nand space.)<br />\nAs a round figure, therefore,<br />\nwe could expect upwards of 50<br />\nPercent of present first-year students to be drafted, along with 50<br />\npercent of the normal qualified<br />\napplicant group for next year. If<br />\nno offsetting steps were taken, this<br />\nwould reduce our 1968-69 total<br />\ngraduate enrollment in Arts and<br />\nSciences by 400 students(out of a<br />\nnormal of about 1,550.)<br />\n:the gross financial impact<br />\nwould be a loss of tuition revenue<br />\nof $2,000 per student,or $800,000<br />\nThis would be partly offset by<br /><br />\nsavings in financial aid to students<br />\nfrom general university funds; we<br />\nestimate the residual net impact at<br />\nabout $550,000.<br />\nThis is a very important sum in<br />\nour overall financial picture. While<br />\nthe total annual budget for Arts<br />\nand Sciences(including undergraduate as well as post-graduate and<br />\npost-doctoral training, which are<br />\nhandled by the same faculty)<br />\namounts to about $25 million, the<br />\ncore of irreducible commitments,<br />\nmainly for faculty salaries, is in our<br />\ncategory entitled \"Instruction and<br />\nNon-sponsored Research.\" Last<br />\nyear, this item amounted to $4.6<br />\nmillion, financed as follows: from<br />\ntuition, $3.7 million; from endowment income, $0.5 million; and<br />\nfrom current gifts, $0.4 million. A<br />\nnet tuition loss of $550,000,therefore,amounts to 12 percent of our<br />\ncore expenditures and is more than<br />\nwe have been able to allocate in<br />\nnormal years from either endowment income or from current gifts.<br />\nThere are no obvious alternative<br />\nsources to replace such lost income. In fact, this new financial<br /><br />\nloss would come on top of the reductions now being experienced<br />\nin federal support for fellowships,<br />\ntraining,and research. At the same<br />\ntime, the Ford Foundation has recently announced a more conservative policy of assistance to private universities. This is a period of<br /><br />\nextreme financial stringency for<br />\nall of us, caught as we are between<br />\nthese reductions in important sources of funding at a time when both<br />\noperating and iconstruction costs<br />\nare continuing to rise much more<br />\nrapidly than the general cost of<br />\nliving.<br /><br />\nApart from its financial impact,<br />\nthe loss of half the normal complement of first and second year<br />\ngraduate students would have severely unfavorable effects on undergraduate teaching arrangements<br />\nand teaching quality.

A center both of the<br />\nNew Left and of the radical<br />\nRight, it is probably McCarthy's<br />\nbest chance. (It now appears<br />\nthat an independent group, the<br />\nPeace and Freedom Party, will<br />\nappear on the ballot in California; good though this may be<br />\nfor the long term needs of The<br /><br />\nMovement, it will divert funds<br />\nand energies from the McCarthy<br />\neffort.)<br />\nSo McCarthy may triumph in<br />\nthe primaries but unless he can get<br />\nan organizational base in the party,<br />\nit is not likely to matter. Until<br />\nMcCarthy can get men like Seantors McGovern and Tydings behind him, he will not have a real<br /><br />\nchance. But the McGoverns and<br />\nTydings behind him, he will not<br />\njoin the McCarthy campaign until<br />\nthey are convinced he has a chance,<br />\nand he won't have a chance until<br />\nthey joint him.<br />\nThere is one and only one way<br />\nto break that deadlock. An inspirational campaign might, in the<br />\nAmerica of 1968, really catch the<br /><br />\npopular,spirit and imagination, and<br />\nlaunch the sort of popular crusade<br />\nthat alone would attract the \"respectable\" moderates, partisans of<br />\nthe stagnant center that stifles<br />\nAmerican politics, to his banner.<br />\nUnfortunately, McCarthy, though<br />\nhe has the potential, has not yet<br />\nplayed the role. His campaign has<br />\nbeen lackluster and uninspired. He<br /><br />\neyour Ito\u00b0<br />\nw growlog<br />\ncoospatile<br />\ntie<br />\n300<br /><br />\nhas made curious statements that<br />\ncontradict the tenor of his effort<br />\n(we must be prepared to \"draw the<br />\nline\" in Thialand; even after peace<br />\nwe may retain troops in Vietnam<br />\nfor years). What other people call<br />\ncynical Realpolitic McCarthy has<br />\ntrumpeted in the name of morality.<br />\n\"We must raise the essential moral<br />\nquestion as to whether or not there<br />\nis a proper balance in what we may<br />\ngain in what is projected as victory, in contrast with the loss of<br />\nlife, the loss of material goods, the<br />\nloss of moral integrity and moral<br />\nenergy which goes with this effort.\" Superficially eloquent, and<br />\nplausible as a pragamatic appeal,<br />\nthat statement, as a moral call to<br />\narms, does not ring true. Once or<br />\ntwice McCarthy has been able to<br />\nsynthesize the ight sense of urgency and conviction, but his campaign so far has been strikingly<br />\nlack-luster.<br />\nYet one is distressed by the<br />\ntendency of the peace movement<br />\nto dismiss McCarthy's move as a<br />\nuseless gesture. For those who<br />\nwant to end the war now, McCarthy is the only hope, however<br />\nfrail. It is as irrelevant as it is true,<br />\nthat a McCarthy victory could set<br />\nback the long term goals of The<br />\nMovement, which needs an Independent political thrust, those(and<br />\nthere are many)who conclude that<br />\nto preserve our \"purity\" we must<br />\nkeep hands off McCarthy are guilty of putting the peace movement,<br />\nand their own intellectual pride,<br />\nabove peace.

Hairy, Diseased beings that may eventaully<br />\nbreak loose in all of us. There are<br />\nthe family of psychoses, the four<br />\neyed schizophrenia, the unpredictable manic- depressive.: the sullen<br />\nand gloomy paranoia, and others<br />\nunpronounceable. There are also<br />\nthe subconcious cell and hobnob<br />\nabout in the occipital district. Dr.<br />\nFrank has enough problems dealing<br />\nwith these vile creatures in the individual human mind. However, it<br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nis when he discovers animals of the<br />\nlast sort in the mind of a nation,<br />\nthen, he as well as all of us, have<br />\nproblems.<br />\nProfessional ethics, being as<br />\nthey are induced him to write on<br />\nthe subject, and his book, Sanity<br />\nand Survival: Psychological Aspects of War and Peace, was released Thursday, and is available in<br />\nthe Hopkins bookstore.<br />\nDr. Frank's thesis is that nations are not necessarily neurotic<br />\nbut that today nations tend to<br />\nsolve their problems in the manner<br />\nthat a neurotic individual would.<br />\nThat is to say, this nation is attempting to solve its problems by<br />\nmeans that were successful in the<br />\nage of conventional weapons, but<br />\nis not succeeding in the age of nuclear weapons.

It<br />\nis his opinion that our goals have<br />\nshifted from the tangible \u2014 the elimination of the Communist powers, to the intangible \u2014 a justification of our insistence to defend<br />\nSoutheast Asia. These characteristics are also evident in a neurotic<br />\nindividual, according to Dr. Frank<br />\n\u2014 that this individual will try to<br />\njustify old mistakes by making new<br />\nmistakes. This country feels it<br />\nmust keep sending -money and<br />\ntroops in to prove that we were<br />\nright in the first place.<br />\nFrank further says that there<br />\nare two types of wars, territorial<br />\nand ideological. Territorial wars<br />\nend when the territory has been<br />\nconquered, but ideological wars<br />\nare fought until the opposing ideology has been eliminated. It is his<br />\nopinion that we find ourselves in<br />\nthis ideological kind of war, from<br />\nwhich we may not be able to extricate ourselves. The North Vietnamese, he asserts, are in the same<br /><br />\nposition as well.<br />\n\u2022 The individual leaders of certain nations have shown sehility at<br />\ntimes by not being able to function normally. Among those used<br />\nas examples are Wilson in his last<br />\nterm and Roosevelt at Yalta.<br />\nInvolved also is the fact that<br />\nscience is moving too fast for the<br />\naverage man to keep abreast of the<br />\npossible benefits, as well as the<br />\npossible dangers. Dr. Frank claims<br />\nthat we have to adjust to 25 years<br />\nof changes that our forebearers<br />\nhad 2500 years to adjust to. The<br />\narms race, a defense system, mass<br />\ncommunications, all of these are<br />\nperplexing to the fragile human<br />\nanimal.<br />\nBut the point that Dr. Frank<br />\nwishes to make is that changes in<br />\nthis world can be adjusted to if<br />\nwe are given enough time. He is<br />\nhopeful about the United Nations,<br />\nthe International Geophysical<br />\nYear, mass communications, and<br />\nmass air transport. Also encouraging is that no war has been fought<br />\nto conclusion since the second<br />\nworld war.

In addition, surveys have found Negro<br />\nvoting power is crippled because<br />\nthe likelihood of voting is inversely<br />\nat?<br />\ncorrelated with the age of the<br />\nvoter.<br />\nIn contrast, Baltimore's white<br />\nPopulation regularly demonstrates<br />\nhigh turn-out, and the median<br />\nage of the white citizen is higher.<br />\nAnother factor in the lack of<br />\nNegro voting power in the city is<br />\nunderregistration. Of the 118 NC-,<br /><br />\ngro precincts sampled on January<br />\n1, 1966, only 21.5% of the voters<br />\nwere registered, as opposed to<br />\n47.2% of the whites in 260 precincts sampled.<br />\nBack to Lincoln<br />\nThese conditions are aggravated<br />\nby the registrational traits of the<br />\nNegroes who do vote. In Baltimore, which approximates Southern patterns, Negroes register in<br />\nhigher percentages in G.O.P. ranks<br />\nthan do white voters. This trend<br />\nhas been precipitated by the distinct, latently strong kindship of<br />\nthe Republicans as the party of<br />\nLincoln.<br />\nLoevy asserted that the Negro<br />\ntends to vote only at the top of<br />\nthe ticket, that is, for the first one<br />\nor two offices that appear on the<br />\nballot. He rarely votes on bond issues and questions, which are further down the ballot. Moreover, a.<br />\nviable two-party system does not<br />\nexist in Baltimore as legislature and<br />\nCity Council are basically Democratic.<br />\nLoevy saw hope for Negro progress in the political arena if, like<br />\npast minority groups, they followed the \"long tenement trail.\" He<br />\ncited the one-bloc vote of Irish<br />\nCatholics, who have become powers in Democratic Party organizations.<br /><br />\nPAGE THIRTEEN<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEBRUARY 16, 1968<br /><br />\nThe administration's present<br />\nplans call for \"new appointments<br />\nin such areas as chemical physics<br />\nof surfaces, electrode processes,<br />\nheterogeneous catalysis, statistical<br />\nmechanics of liquids and biomedical engineering.\"<br />\nSeveral graduate students denounced this move as \"tokenism\"<br />\nand claimed that the \"heart of<br />\nchemical 'engineering was being<br />\neliminated.\" They accused the administration of slowly trying to<br />\neliminate engineering as a discipline at the University, particularly in those fields where more applied sciences were involved.<br />\nThe subjects which the University pin-pointed, are all considered<br />\nperipheral to the chemical engineer. The major areas like transfer<br />\nprocesses would not be taught after the department's reorganization.<br />\nBoth graduate and undergraduate students feel that the \"administration wants to see the department die quietly.\" The Board<br />\nof Trustees, according to reliable<br />\nsources, had called in a chemist to<br />\nadvise them on the fate of the department.

Failing that, the very best you can do is to<br />\nmake morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is<br />\npossible if you will follow three simple rules:<br />\n1. Shave properly.<br />\nBy shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don't use<br />\na blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time<br />\nof clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor<br />\nangs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no<br />\nsqueak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on<br />\nyour lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna<br />\nSuper Stainless Steel Blades.<br />\nI have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive<br />\nuntil one considers that I am 49 years old) and I am here<br />\nto tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not<br />\nonly shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old virtues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Personna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna<br />\ndoes not rasp and tug, yelling, \"Hey, lookit me!\" No, sir,<br />\nnot Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Personna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It<br />\nshucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.<br />\nWhy, you hardly know it's there, this well-bred Personna<br />\nblade, this paragon of punctilio.<br />\nMoreover, this crown of the blade-maker's art, this<br />\nepitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Doubleedge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get<br />\nsome.<br />\n2. Breakfast properly.<br />\nI assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible<br />\nshaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, bracing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for the<br />\nhideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an<br />\nample breakfast.<br />\nTake,for example,the ease of Basil Metabolism, a sophomore al. V.M.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspection by the Commandant one morning, prepared by storing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would<br />\nnot sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of<br />\neggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,<br />\na swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a<br />\nthatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.<br /><br />\nThe idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When<br />\nthe Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that<br />\nhe could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He<br />\nwas, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today,<br />\na perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander<br />\nin Cleveland.<br />\n3. Read properlb.<br />\nAlways read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.<br />\nBut do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acidmaking news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper\u2014<br />\nthe Home and Garden section, for example.<br />\nFor instance, in my local paper, The Westport Peasant,<br />\nthere is a delightful column called \"Ask Harry Homespun\" which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and<br />\nmany an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and<br />\nanswers:<br />\nQ: I am thinking of buying some power tools.
