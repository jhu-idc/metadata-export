We are shown<br />\nthe B.S.-in-chemistry at work on the local newspaper;<br />\nthe engineering grad floor-walking in a department<br />\nstore; or the economics student selling silk stockings<br />\nfrom door to door. And such anomalies are distorted<br />\ninto scathing indictments of the educational system.<br />\nBut such a reaction to the tragically-humorous<br />\nsituation of the misplaced college student is not an<br />\nintelligent one. Even after the condition is modified<br />\nby realizing that the economic maladjustment of our<br />\npresent time is largely responsible for the graduates'<br />\nplight, the universities still may be cleared of the<br />\ncharge of having proven themselves fruitless. The<br />\njustification comes in recognizing the use to which<br />\nmost students intend to put their educations.<br />\nLet's set aside for the moment the ideal of a<br />\nuniversity education\u2014that the cause of truth may be<br />\npropagated and the world be bettered for having<br />\nmore intelligent citizens. It's a nice platitude and is<br />\nadhered to with varying degrees of tenacity. But<br />\nit is yet undeniable that most students come to college<br />\nto fit themselves to achieve economic independence.<br />\nThe idealistic side is merely incidental. And a college education derived in the proper manner will certainly contribute tremendously to the ability, to become<br />\nindependent.<br />\nWhether the preparation for a career be specific<br />\nor not the essential point of learning is the acquirement of a mental capacity\u2014which, in turn, is a combination of alertness and adaptability. The actual<br />\ntechnique of an individual science is unimportant provided the student grasp the rational processes underlying it. If college teaches young men to cope with<br />\nproblems and to attack difficulties of a varied nature<br />\nwith some degree of success the question of whether<br />\nor not they find an opening in their specialized field<br />\nwill have little effect upon their ability to advance<br />\nthemselves. A well-trained mind can make itself<br />\nadept in almost any kind of intellectual exercise.<br />\n<br />\nFootball Has Not Blinded Our Eyes<br />\n(Editor's note: The following article appeared as<br />\nan editorial in the Southern California \"Daily Trojan.\" It was written in reply to the annual report of<br />\nthe Carnegie foundation for the advancement of<br />\nteaching, in which Henry S. Pritchett, president emeritus of the foundation, scored commercialism in modern college football and directed attacks against Notre<br />\nDame and Southern California far their alleged dedi-<br />\n<br />\ncation of profit-motives in making a three-year contract for games.)<br />\nSouthern , California students this morning may<br />\nwonder why the Daily Trojan prints the charges<br />\nagainst the university by Henry S. Pritchett,. of New<br />\nYork, president emeritus of the Carnegie foundation<br />\nfor the advancement of teaching, who accuses S. C. of<br />\nundue emphasis on football.<br />\nWe believe that Dr. Pritchett has heard but one<br />\nside of the story concerning the University of Southern California. If it is true that Trojan Football teams<br />\nhave carried the name of the university throughout<br />\nthe United States, and it is unfortunate in this regard<br />\nthat many people hear of the university in no other<br />\nconnection than football. They hear of packed stadiums, they hear the games over the radio on Saturday<br />\nafternoon, they hear the stirring Trojan marching<br />\nsongs all the year round and they think of the university in no other terms.<br />\nThis we regret deeply. We know, and we wish<br />\nothers knew, the other side of S. C. How many of<br />\nthose people who shout the word \"Trojan\" on Saturday afternoon know that behind Trojan stands the<br />\nforemost school of rithilosophy in the United States,<br />\nthat the speech school is rated foremost in the West,<br />\nthat valuable research is being carried on by the School<br />\nof Medicine, that the student newspaper is one of the<br />\nmost liberal in the country, and that S. C. students<br />\nstudy under a most enlightened faculty?<br />\nThese are things that people forget, yet they, not<br />\nfootball, make up the university. Because we have<br />\nbeen fortunate in having a team which has won a large<br />\npercentage of its games during the past three years we<br />\nhear the \"cry that we are a football school, when<br />\nthis is not necessarily the case.

This was<br />\nthat German student duels are much<br />\nsafer than college football.<br />\nThough the report, written by Dr.<br />\nHenry S. Pritchett, president emeritus of the Carnegie Foundation<br />\nfor the Advancement of Teaching,<br />\nwill in all probability not be taken<br />\nvery seriously by the students at<br />\nAmerican colleges, its contents are<br />\nof unusual interest. In explaining<br />\nhis assertion that the duels engaged<br />\nin by German students are safer<br />\nthan football, Dr. Pritchett declared<br />\nthat in the duels \"A fatal encounter<br />\nis practically unknown, and a serious<br />\nwound so rare as to be negligible.\"<br />\nBut this assertion is to be<br />\nstrongly questioned, even in view<br />\nof the fact that dueling is not very<br />\nlikely to be substituted for football<br />\nat the Hopkins and other universities of the United States. For in<br />\nthe duels serious wounds are not<br />\nrare at all. Unlike the American<br />\nsport of football, the duels of the<br />\nHeidelberg youths are affairs of<br />\nhonor. Naturally, when a passionate young man has been insulted and<br />\nhe challenges another man to a duel<br />\nfor satisfaction, he is out to punish<br />\nthe man with as good a saber slash<br />\nas possible. The result is to be<br />\nseen when the surgeons fix up the<br />\nface of the loser, which may be laid<br />\nopen from ear to ear; and, if the<br />\nwound is a serious one, the man will<br />\ncarry a hideous scar on his face for<br />\nthe rest of his life. The Germans<br />\nthemselves recognized the evils of<br />\nstudent dueling, and it was outlawed in Germany until Herr Hitler came to the seat of power and<br />\nremoved the ban.<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\nHER MAJESTY,<br />\nQUEEN ELIZABETH<br />\n<br />\nTHE RECENT sad death of<br />\nKing Albert I of Belgium has<br />\nbrought up stories of many things<br />\nbesides the perils of mountain climbing.

We are shown<br />\nthe B.S.-in-chemistry at work on the local newspaper;<br />\nthe engineering grad floor-walking in a department<br />\nstore; or the economics student selling silk stockings<br />\nfrom door to door. And such anomalies are distorted<br />\ninto scathing indictments of the educational system.<br />\nBut such a reaction to the tragically-humorous<br />\nsituation of the misplaced college student is not an<br />\nintelligent one. Even after the condition is modified<br />\nby realizing that the economic maladjustment of our<br />\npresent time is largely responsible for the graduates'<br />\nplight, the universities still may be cleared of the<br />\ncharge of having proven themselves fruitless. The<br />\njustification comes in recognizing the use to which<br />\nmost students intend to put their educations.<br />\nLet's set aside for the moment the ideal of a<br />\nuniversity education\u2014that the cause of truth may be<br />\npropagated and the world be bettered for having<br />\nmore intelligent citizens. It's a nice platitude and is<br />\nadhered to with varying degrees of tenacity. But<br />\nit is yet undeniable that most students come to college<br />\nto fit themselves to achieve economic independence.<br />\nThe idealistic side is merely incidental. And a college education derived in the proper manner will certainly contribute tremendously to the ability, to become<br />\nindependent.<br />\nWhether the preparation for a career be specific<br />\nor not the essential point of learning is the acquirement of a mental capacity\u2014which, in turn, is a combination of alertness and adaptability. The actual<br />\ntechnique of an individual science is unimportant provided the student grasp the rational processes underlying it. If college teaches young men to cope with<br />\nproblems and to attack difficulties of a varied nature<br />\nwith some degree of success the question of whether<br />\nor not they find an opening in their specialized field<br />\nwill have little effect upon their ability to advance<br />\nthemselves. A well-trained mind can make itself<br />\nadept in almost any kind of intellectual exercise.<br /><br />\nFootball Has Not Blinded Our Eyes<br />\n(Editor's note: The following article appeared as<br />\nan editorial in the Southern California \"Daily Trojan.\" It was written in reply to the annual report of<br />\nthe Carnegie foundation for the advancement of<br />\nteaching, in which Henry S. Pritchett, president emeritus of the foundation, scored commercialism in modern college football and directed attacks against Notre<br />\nDame and Southern California far their alleged dedi-<br /><br />\ncation of profit-motives in making a three-year contract for games.)<br />\nSouthern , California students this morning may<br />\nwonder why the Daily Trojan prints the charges<br />\nagainst the university by Henry S. Pritchett,. of New<br />\nYork, president emeritus of the Carnegie foundation<br />\nfor the advancement of teaching, who accuses S. C. of<br />\nundue emphasis on football.<br />\nWe believe that Dr. Pritchett has heard but one<br />\nside of the story concerning the University of Southern California. If it is true that Trojan Football teams<br />\nhave carried the name of the university throughout<br />\nthe United States, and it is unfortunate in this regard<br />\nthat many people hear of the university in no other<br />\nconnection than football. They hear of packed stadiums, they hear the games over the radio on Saturday<br />\nafternoon, they hear the stirring Trojan marching<br />\nsongs all the year round and they think of the university in no other terms.<br />\nThis we regret deeply. We know, and we wish<br />\nothers knew, the other side of S. C. How many of<br />\nthose people who shout the word \"Trojan\" on Saturday afternoon know that behind Trojan stands the<br />\nforemost school of rithilosophy in the United States,<br />\nthat the speech school is rated foremost in the West,<br />\nthat valuable research is being carried on by the School<br />\nof Medicine, that the student newspaper is one of the<br />\nmost liberal in the country, and that S. C. students<br />\nstudy under a most enlightened faculty?<br />\nThese are things that people forget, yet they, not<br />\nfootball, make up the university. Because we have<br />\nbeen fortunate in having a team which has won a large<br />\npercentage of its games during the past three years we<br />\nhear the \"cry that we are a football school, when<br />\nthis is not necessarily the case. Other schools do the<br />\nvery same things that Dr. Pritchett considers so bad<br />\nin Southern California and Notre Dame, but they<br />\nreceive no unfavorable mention.<br />\nWe feel that Dr. Pritchett should not worry<br />\nabout the intellectual attainments of the university<br />\nsimply because the football team has had better than<br />\naverage success. We wish him to know that we love<br />\nand cherish the ideal of a university here as much as<br />\nin the cultural centers of Europe, that we are mindful<br />\nof the purpose of an educational institution, and<br />\nthat we do not intend that we should lose sight of the<br />\ndevotion and purpose of the fathers who created this<br />\nuniversity in southern California.<br /><br />\nDO YOU KNOW?<br />\nTHAT Coe College sophomores don't believe a<br />\nco-ed's appearance is enhanced by use of lipstick and<br />\nnail polish, a recent survey shows.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nTHAT Harvard University has as a librarian<br />\nPrince Toumaneff, once general in the Russian Imperial army.<br />\n\u2014 \u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nTHAT an enterprising co-ed at Minnesota had a final<br />\nexam taken by proxy.

This was<br />\nthat German student duels are much<br />\nsafer than college football.<br />\nThough the report, written by Dr.<br />\nHenry S. Pritchett, president emeritus of the Carnegie Foundation<br />\nfor the Advancement of Teaching,<br />\nwill in all probability not be taken<br />\nvery seriously by the students at<br />\nAmerican colleges, its contents are<br />\nof unusual interest. In explaining<br />\nhis assertion that the duels engaged<br />\nin by German students are safer<br />\nthan football, Dr. Pritchett declared<br />\nthat in the duels \"A fatal encounter<br />\nis practically unknown, and a serious<br />\nwound so rare as to be negligible.\"<br />\nBut this assertion is to be<br />\nstrongly questioned, even in view<br />\nof the fact that dueling is not very<br />\nlikely to be substituted for football<br />\nat the Hopkins and other universities of the United States. For in<br />\nthe duels serious wounds are not<br />\nrare at all. Unlike the American<br />\nsport of football, the duels of the<br />\nHeidelberg youths are affairs of<br />\nhonor. Naturally, when a passionate young man has been insulted and<br />\nhe challenges another man to a duel<br />\nfor satisfaction, he is out to punish<br />\nthe man with as good a saber slash<br />\nas possible. The result is to be<br />\nseen when the surgeons fix up the<br />\nface of the loser, which may be laid<br />\nopen from ear to ear; and, if the<br />\nwound is a serious one, the man will<br />\ncarry a hideous scar on his face for<br />\nthe rest of his life. The Germans<br />\nthemselves recognized the evils of<br />\nstudent dueling, and it was outlawed in Germany until Herr Hitler came to the seat of power and<br />\nremoved the ban.<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br />\nHER MAJESTY,<br />\nQUEEN ELIZABETH<br /><br />\nTHE RECENT sad death of<br />\nKing Albert I of Belgium has<br />\nbrought up stories of many things<br />\nbesides the perils of mountain climbing.

Thayer. On the way around,<br />\nso the story goes, Dr. Thayer took<br />\nthe Queen through the Phipps Clinic, where, in the course of the tour,<br />\nthey encountered Dr. Meyer. Dr.<br />\nThayer stopped Dr. Meyer to present him to the Queen of Belgium.<br />\n\"Your Majesty,\" he said, with a<br />\ncourtly bow, \"this is Dr. Meyer.\"<br />\nDr. Meyer glanced at Queen<br />\nElizabeth with a keen psychiatrical<br />\neye.
