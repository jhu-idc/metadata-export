Remsen and Prof. Vincent.<br />\nThere is nothing more interesting to the<br />\nreaders of the popular magazines of Japan<br />\nthan the views of porminent Americans on<br />\nthe Russo-Japanese conflict.<br />\nThe leading<br />\narticle in the current issue of the most widely circulated monthly of Nippon, the Tokio<br />\nTaiyo (Sun), is a case in point. It is entitled \"The War Views of President Remsen<br />\nand Professor Vincent of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniitersity,\" and was contributed by Mr.<br />\nK. Morimoto, who is now a student at the<br />\nHopkins. The article not only contains the<br />\nviews of these prominent Baltimore educators, but their photographs. The photograph<br />\nof Dr. Remsen is reproduced here just as it<br />\nappears in the Taiyo.<br />\n\"It is,\" writes Mr. Morimoto, \"a source<br />\nof great pleasure to know that so far Japan<br />\nhas won almost all the battles in this great<br />\nwar with Russia, and it augurs well for the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nBut it is interesting to observe<br />\nhow, since war was declared, America and<br />\nEurope view the conflict.<br />\n\"At the Johns Hopkins University everyone is, of course, well informed as to Japanese history, manners and customs. here<br />\neveryone, with the exception, perhaps, of<br />\na single Russian student, is strongly proJapanese. Even President Remsen, who is<br />\nknown from one end of Nippon to the other<br />\nas a chemist and scientist, and whose textbooks on organic and inorganic chemistry<br />\nare studied in every Japanese college and<br />\nuniversity, does not attempt to conceal his<br />\nenthusiasm over the Japanese successes at<br />\narms. But it must be remembered that,<br />\nwhile Dr. Remsen is primarily a scientist and<br />\nhead\u2022 of one of the greatest Universities of<br />\nthe world, he is at the same time a man of<br />\nwarm heart, great personal magnetism and<br />\ndeep human interest, and it is this that endears him to the students.<br />\n. `!In a conversation with President Remsen<br />\n<br />\na few days ago he spoke most interestingly<br />\nof our Island Empire and the war we are<br />\nwaging with Russia. 'Japan,' he said,'wants<br />\nto expand, and this is necessary because of<br />\nthe dense population of the islands; but Russia, too, wants an ice-free port in Manchuria.<br />\nBoth countries moving in the same direction<br />\nmade war inevitable, and now that it has<br />\ncome, there are many reasons why I should<br />\nlike to see Japan the victor. But I am<br />\nnaturally prejudiced in favor of the Japanese because so many of your prominent<br />\nmen have been educated at the Johns Hopkins. Among the first to come here was Dr.<br />\nKuhara, then Drs. Mitsukuri, Sato, Motara,<br />\nNakaseko, Nitohe\u2014all Ph. D.'s of this institution. Many others have been students<br />\nhere, but these men I know well, and from<br />\nthem I hav,e learned to admire the Jap, not<br />\nonly as a student, but as a man. I have .<br />\nno unfriendly feeling toward Russia, but the<br />\nvery fact that these and other students of<br />\nyour nationality have been identified with<br />\nthe Hopkins and-have been diligent students<br />\nand have taken their degrees here makes me<br />\nfeel, as it were, that they are the children of<br />\nour University. It may not be scientific or<br />\nrational to think this way, and it is certainly<br />\nnot impartial, but the same thing may be<br />\nsaid of patriotism.<br />\n\"'The yellow peril? Yes, it is dangerous<br />\nif Japan is victorious, and so influences China<br />\nthat the two, acting together, close the seaports of the Orient for their own selfish ends.<br />\nHowever, I cannot believe that this will happen, for Japan, though victorious, is too<br />\ncivilized to take such a step, and so antagonize the rest of the civilized world. Japan<br />\nhas always\u2022 been progressive, 'and she has<br />\nstood for the open-door policy in the East,<br />\nand as .each year your country is assimilating more and more of Western civilization,<br />\nand thus identifying her interests with those<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nst<br />\n\"--46..1001=010<br />\n<br />\n31<br />\n<br />\nXi It\u00b07-E A lc<br />\n<br />\nri 0<br />\nV a<br />\n.- 1L<br />\n-7.<br />\n.ffiriff -TI a Y.. lc v) * A gc o)_.<br />\n;% c_F _i '1ti ; IL (\u00bb iiit di<br />\n7 lc 1-i * t't f),5 -t 144 1E iiiri 0, iTi 11 h- tiii firi 6 :;t,<br />\n)<br />\nfil lt: (<br />\n<br />\nic ilt a 4)4<br />\n7 6 . t '-;':<br />\nt lc\u00b06 A-v- Is'' Pft filS ta \u2014 ()<br />\nM.

The progress of your<br />\ncountry during the last 50 years has astonished the world, but the next half century<br />\nis fuller of great possibilities than the first<br />\n50 years of new Japan. . .<br />\nDr. Vincent Also A Strong \"Pro.\"<br />\n\"Dr. Vincent, who is chief of the historical department of the Hopkins, is also strongly pro-Japanese.<br />\n\"Said Dr. Vincent in expressing his views<br />\non the war:<br />\n\"'In view of the advances of Russia in the<br />\nEast, the Japanese are wisely anticipating<br />\nthe future. It has often been noted that<br />\nthe Americans, as a whole, take part with<br />\nJapan rather than with Russia. The explanation is simple\u2014they do not like the<br />\nRussian form of government. The Americans live under free institutions, and they<br />\ncannot sympathize with the arbitrary and<br />\ntyrannical methods pursued by the Russian<br />\nGovernment. It is not the outbreaks of violence, which sometimes result in massacre,<br />\nfor these are the exceptions. It is the<br />\nsteady- every-day despotism which keeps the<br />\npeasantry in bondage and the intellectual<br />\nclasses in fear. . . f<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS AT ST. LOUIS.<br />\nThe exhibits of the University and Medical<br />\nSchool in the Education and Social Economy<br />\nBuilding at the World's Fair, as usual, is<br />\nsuperior to the other college and university<br />\nexhibits. While these other institutions devote much space to pictures of the buildings,<br />\nathletic teams, etc., the Hopknis exhibits<br />\nshow the work that is being done in the<br />\nUniversity. The Medical School has a fine<br />\nset of pictures of the investigations carried<br />\non there; the geological department, although its main exhibit is in the Mines and<br />\nMetallurgy Building, is, nevertheless, briefly,<br />\nbut well represented. The physical laboratory has exhibited a number of Prof. Rowland's machines, together with several of<br />\nhis diffraction gratings\u2014the one with twenty<br />\nthousand lines to the inch being the msot<br />\nnoteworthy.<br />\nIn addition to these exhibits, all the publications of the University are to be seen.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral other small exhibits, including that<br />\nof the Semitic department are also exhibited.<br />\nAn important omission is that of the chemical department. Although this department<br />\nhas now more students than any other department in the University, no attempt has<br />\nbeen made to show the magnificent work<br />\nnow being done here in that line.<br />\nAnother thing which perhaps most of the<br />\nHopkins students visiting this exhibit have<br />\nnoticed is that there is no book in which to<br />\nregister. This may seem a small matter to<br />\nsome, but, nevertheless, it would have been<br />\nmade good use of if it had been there.<br />\n<br />\nTHE FIGURE 4.<br />\nI am not as superstitious<br />\nAs some men are wont to be,<br />\nAnd I do not care a pebble<br />\nFor the hoot owl up the tree;<br />\nE'en the wood has known no rappings,<br />\nThough I've boasted o'er and o'er,<br />\nBut somehow there's something awful<br />\n'Bout that beastly figure 4.<br />\nIt pursues me in the night time,<br />\nWhen the lamp is burning low,<br />\nWand'ring up and down my history<br />\nAs I turn the pages slow;<br />\nGrowing deeper, darker, plainer,<br />\nAs the lesson's end I near,<br />\nTill at last I close the pages,<br />\nSneak to bed in chilly fear.<br />\nAnd through all my college courses,<br />\nDoes that ghastly figure stay,<br />\nThough I've tried full hard to conquer,<br />\nTried by night-time and by day.<br />\nStill with wicked looks it follows,<br />\nClouding o'er my courses dark,<br />\nTill the very worst has happened,<br />\nAnd it turns into a mark.<br />\nWould that I could juggle figures,<br />\nChange the loaded, fateful die,<br />\nThen no more would this dire phantom<br />\nFlit before my frenzied eye;<br />\nAh, no longer would I worry,<br />\nFor no sooner said than done,<br />\nWould the 4 of all my troubles,<br />\nPass into the figure 1.<br />\n'06.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nTHE ANNUAL RUSH.<br />\nThe rush between the Junior and Freshman classes, on the first day of the new<br />\ncollegiate year, has hitherto been an illegal<br />\nand forbidden amusement which the classes<br />\nengaged in at their peril, knowing that the<br />\ncollege authorities would use every means<br />\nto enforce quiet in the University's precincts. As a result, the struggle, broken<br />\noff in one place, often renewed itself at a<br />\nsafer distance from the University. Even<br />\nhere, armed intervention was a probability,<br />\nand the contest was apt, therefore, to reach<br />\nan unsatisfactory and inconclusive termination, each side feeling that if it had been<br />\nallowed to fight it out, the result would have<br />\nbeen highly gratifying and most honorable<br />\nto itself. In addition to this disadvantage,<br />\nthere was offered to the public of Baltimore<br />\nthe edifying spectacle of a busy thoroughfare blocked by a struggling melee in which<br />\nwere mingled a large number of young gentlemen who proceeded to throw each other<br />\nabout violently, and to denude each other<br />\nof important garments; a squad of more or<br />\nless helpless policemen who rushed aimlessly<br />\naround the outskirts arresting bystanders<br />\nand inoffensive freshmen who preferred to<br />\nstand on the edge of the fight and look on.<br />\nAll this display was very undesirable, of<br />\ncourse. When \"the Hopkins gets to Homewood\" all these little affairs can be settled<br />\nrespectably and privately on the spacious<br />\ncampus. At present, however, we lack that<br />\nvaluable field for operations, and some way<br />\nhas to be found to make up for its absence.<br />\n<br />\nThis year, therefore, it was decided to<br />\nauthorize the affair and allow it to be held<br />\nprivately in the cage, thus avoiding publicity, and the overworking of the police in<br />\norder to keep the sidewalks open.<br />\nThe<br />\nwhole business with its status established<br />\ncame off without a hitch. The gymnasium<br />\nwalls shut out the public, and the two classes<br />\nsettled their accounts with each other in<br />\ndecent privacy, while the seniors present saw<br />\nto the proper conduct of things, and stopped<br />\nthe fight when it had gone far enough. It<br />\nis probable that the same arrangement will<br />\nbe made next year, since it worked so well<br />\nthis time. Of course, the dirty floor of the<br />\ncage is not as good to roll on as the grass'<br />\nof the Homewood campus, but it is certainly<br />\nan improvement on the brick pavement of<br />\nHoward Street. As a temporary expedient<br />\nthe cage is certainly very satisfactory. In<br />\ntime the University will offer greater convenience, for such affairs.<br />\nREFUSED.<br />\nI met the sweetest summer girl,<br />\nAnd it was so enraging,<br />\nThat though she was attractive quite,<br />\nShe wouldn't be engaging.<br />\nA.

U.; or box 16, Medical School.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nAs will be noticed, the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nmakes its first appearance for the academic<br />\nyear in an entirely new cover. The question of a new cover has been before the<br />\nBoard for some time\u2014in fact, the subject<br />\nwas broached last spring. Owing to the<br />\npaper's loss in the fire, however, it was decided to get along with a plain one until<br />\nthe end of the year.<br />\nSeveral other features which we hope will<br />\nbe for the best interests of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill also be noticed. We believe the paper<br />\nshould have a larger circulation among the<br />\nMedical students, the graduates, and the<br />\nalumni of the University than at present.<br />\nFor this reason, we have secured representatives in the first two departments who have<br />\npromised to contribute anything of interest.<br />\nFor the alumni notes, we are dependent upon<br />\ncharity. If the alumni would bear in mind<br />\nthat charity begins at their Alma Mater, the<br />\ncolumn would doubtless be much longer.<br />\nThey are urged most strongly to send in any<br />\nalumni notes at any time this fall.<br />\nThe Board loses two excellent men\u2014both<br />\nof them hard and consistent workers. Mr.<br />\nMurkland has been especially close to the<br />\nEditor and the latter wishes to thank him in<br />\nthe name of the Board for his hearty cooperation. Mr. Baetjer has had a no less<br />\n<br />\nresponsible position in looking out for the<br />\nfinancial end of the NEWS-LETTER, and has<br />\nalways had the welfare of the paper at<br />\nheart.<br />\nThe retirement of these two men leaves<br />\ntwo vacancies; one of the assistant businessmanager, and one of assistant news-editor.<br />\nBoth places are open to students in the<br />\nFreshman and Junior classes. Several men<br />\nare already trying for these places; out of<br />\nthe large Freshman class there ought to be<br />\na larger number than ever trying for the<br />\ntwo places. There will be another vacancy<br />\nnext month and several more at Easter, when<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER passes into the hands of<br />\nthe present Junior class.<br />\nThe apathy of the athletic board towards<br />\nfootball, at least, and from talk heard around<br />\nthe University towards baseball, we judge,<br />\nis a thing of the past. All who are acquainted with the athletic situation will acknowledge that there is great difficulty to be surmounted in re-establishing these sports on<br />\na firm foundation; yet the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nfirmly believes that what has been done this<br />\nfall could and should have been done over<br />\na year. ago. For this reason, it is perhaps<br />\nfortunate, a new board in sympathy with<br />\nthis go-ahead-spirit has been elected.<br />\nThat the new board, if it push forward<br />\nthe project vigorously, will have the goodwill and support of the majority of students<br />\nis very evident from the discussion on the<br />\nsubject heard around the University.<br />\nIt is too early to say anything about baseball, but the football season\u2014late as the<br />\nmovement for a team took definite shape\u2014<br />\nhas already opened.

In<br />\nfact, so much brighter than what the<br />\nmanagement had even dared hope for, when<br />\non October 3 the small band of undergraduate students enthusiastically declared for a<br />\nteam, that they have just cause to feel elated.<br />\nOn that date the students met to decide the<br />\nquestion.

Before this, however, the medical and graduate departments<br />\nwere thoroughly scoured in quest of men,<br />\n\"stars\" of undergraduate days were located,<br />\nand after the exact situation was put clearly<br />\nand forcibly before them, they expressed a<br />\nwillingness to do all they could in the way<br />\nof giving active support. The first day out<br />\nwitnessed two full teams on the field.

Mr.<br />\nHorace Whitman is also giving his services<br />\nto bring the men into shape.<br />\nThe management has also partly obviated<br />\nanother serious drawback by being able to<br />\nget Oriole Park baseball grounds for practice. But still the medical men find it exacting upon them to get out there in time;<br />\nyet if the men of the undergraduate departments will stick to the team by coming out<br />\nand furnishing practice games for the 'Varsity as faithfully as the \"meds\" and the<br />\n\"grads,\" the season will pan out all right.<br />\nIt is still a little early to annuonce the<br />\ncomplete schedule, but this will be done as<br />\n_ soon as possible.<br />\n<br />\nTRACK AND FIELD OUTLOOK.<br />\nAt present, the outlook for a track meet<br />\nbefore the first of February is not bright.<br />\nThis is due to the fact that the Fifth Regiment Armory is now occupied by one of the<br />\nleading business firms here in the city, and<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nbecause of this, it will not be obtainable for<br />\nthe purpose of holding track meets.<br />\nOwing to this fact, Captain Hill, of the<br />\ntrack team, will n6t have the men out for<br />\npractice before the first of January. If<br />\nperchance, though it seems improbable at<br />\nthe present time, a meet of any importance<br />\nis to be held in Washington, Captain Hill<br />\nwill issue calls for candidates, and will begin<br />\nregular practice at once.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that it will be impossible to have another meet before the expiration of this year, for the men will have had<br />\nless training.<br />\nNevertheless, it is to be hoped that when<br />\nthe regular work begins, the men will put<br />\nspirit in their practice, and go through the<br />\nseason with flying colors as they have done<br />\nin former years, and end up with the capture of a third banner from Virginia.<br />\n<br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\nShe\u2014I think Flossie will make a model<br />\nwife, don't you?<br />\nlie\u2014Yes, they say that she married an<br />\nartist.<br />\n\u2014Yale Record.<br />\n\"Foiled,\" muttered the yeast-cake as it<br />\nwas being wrapped in its glittering cover.<br />\n\u2014Yale Record.<br />\nThere was a young girl from Great Br.<br />\nWhose beau was eternally sp.<br />\nShe said, \"You quit chewing;<br />\nOr there'll be something doing;<br />\nIt simply means quit or the mt.\"<br />\n\u2014Sphinx.<br />\nA skittish young mare<br />\nGot more than her share<br />\nOf fright from an automobile;<br />\nWhen her driver came to<br />\nHe found her front shoe<br />\nAnd a hub with some spokes of a wheel.<br />\n\u2014Jester.<br />\nWhat Hans' idea of Heaven is<br />\nWe don't know very well;<br />\nFor he looks up in the sky,<br />\nHe says, \"Der Himmel ist hell.\"<br />\n\u2014Cornell Widow.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\nIN THE GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS.<br />\nMrs. Sidney Lanier and Mary E.

The first exercises of the day were<br />\nheld in the Clinical Amphitheatre of the<br />\nnew building, where a number of most interesting addresses were delivered to an<br />\naudience that over-flowed the auditorium,<br />\nand was composed of officers and professors<br />\nof the University, distinguished guests from<br />\nmany places, and a large number of the<br />\nprominent physicians and surgeons of the<br />\ncity. Following this meeting an excellent<br />\nluncheon was served in the Administration<br />\nBuilding, and further exercises were held in<br />\nthe afternoon, upon the unveiling of a tablet<br />\nto Dr. Lazear, who devoted his life to the<br />\ninvestigation of yellow fever.<br />\nThe building itself is one of the finest,<br />\nmost modern, and best equipped of its kind<br />\nnow in operation anywhere.

In its _columns are<br />\nto be found a summary of the activities of<br />\nthe students; athletics, musical clubs, college<br />\nhappenings\u2014all these claim notice. Most of<br />\nthis class of news is collected by the reportorial staff of the magazine; the literary<br />\npart, such as editorials, poetry, etc., is left<br />\nentirely to the editorial staff, and students,<br />\nunconnected with the magazine, seldom, if<br />\never, contribute. On the part of the editors<br />\nit is a question of getting copy; on the part<br />\nof the outside student, it is merely a question of a little extra work, and if the result<br />\nis meritorious, he has the undeniable pleasure<br />\nof seeing his work in print.<br />\nOf course, training is necessary to be able<br />\nto write an article possessing interest to the<br />\nstudent reader. A scholarly paper on some<br />\nabstruse subject won't \"take\" half as well<br />\nas an amusing incident, cleverly told. In fact,<br />\nhumor and clever expression are indispensable features of a successful article. The<br />\nonly way to acquire this training is to practice.<br />\nThere are two fields for practice open to<br />\nthe average undergraduate. Most students<br />\nknow by the end of their freshman-year what<br />\nis one of the ways. But that practice is<br />\ndevoted to polite literature and to rhetoric.<br />\nThe other field is the college-paper. If undergraduates would write up every \"grind\"<br />\nand happy thought that occurred to him in<br />\na day, the editors would find that selection<br />\ninstead of copy-writing would be their chief<br />\nworry.<br />\nThe training derived from a little practice<br />\nnow and then, with the subsequent disappointment of having one's manuscript returned, thereby spurring one to higher efforts, would be invaluable to many a future<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" editor. I am sure that if more<br />\nmen contributed to the NEWS-LETTER, it<br />\nwould not be necessary for \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\neditors to write most of the \"stuff,\" and<br />\nmuch of the conventionality of a college<br />\nyear-book would be lacking. As it is, most<br />\nof the work is done by a few men, and the<br />\nwork is often on the same lines.<br />\nThe magazine offers an opportunity for<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nillustrators, so that when a call for illustrations for a \"Hullabaloo\" is made, the<br />\neditors won't find it necessary to utilize<br />\noutside help in a student publication. There<br />\nwould be also more of a representation of<br />\nthe whole school in such a \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\nthan in the case of recent class books.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER offers an opportunity<br />\nfor the development of untrained talent.<br />\nThe editors,' I am sure, will be thankful for<br />\nall contributions whether they use them or<br />\nnot. Let every man try to write one article<br />\nto the NEWS-LETTER so that when the \"Hullabaloo\" editors call for contributions they<br />\nwill be embarassed by the quantity and not<br />\nashamed of the quality.<br />\n[This was not written by a member of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER staff nor was it solicited.<br />\nIt came as an entire but welcome surprise].<br />\n<br />\nUNDERGRADUATE NOTES.<br />\nThe Junior Class has elected the following<br />\nofficers to serve for the coming year:\u2014<br />\nPresident, Carl K.

Remsen and Prof. Vincent.<br />\nThere is nothing more interesting to the<br />\nreaders of the popular magazines of Japan<br />\nthan the views of porminent Americans on<br />\nthe Russo-Japanese conflict.<br />\nThe leading<br />\narticle in the current issue of the most widely circulated monthly of Nippon, the Tokio<br />\nTaiyo (Sun), is a case in point. It is entitled \"The War Views of President Remsen<br />\nand Professor Vincent of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniitersity,\" and was contributed by Mr.<br />\nK. Morimoto, who is now a student at the<br />\nHopkins. The article not only contains the<br />\nviews of these prominent Baltimore educators, but their photographs. The photograph<br />\nof Dr. Remsen is reproduced here just as it<br />\nappears in the Taiyo.<br />\n\"It is,\" writes Mr. Morimoto, \"a source<br />\nof great pleasure to know that so far Japan<br />\nhas won almost all the battles in this great<br />\nwar with Russia, and it augurs well for the<br />\nfuture.<br />\nBut it is interesting to observe<br />\nhow, since war was declared, America and<br />\nEurope view the conflict.<br />\n\"At the Johns Hopkins University everyone is, of course, well informed as to Japanese history, manners and customs. here<br />\neveryone, with the exception, perhaps, of<br />\na single Russian student, is strongly proJapanese. Even President Remsen, who is<br />\nknown from one end of Nippon to the other<br />\nas a chemist and scientist, and whose textbooks on organic and inorganic chemistry<br />\nare studied in every Japanese college and<br />\nuniversity, does not attempt to conceal his<br />\nenthusiasm over the Japanese successes at<br />\narms. But it must be remembered that,<br />\nwhile Dr. Remsen is primarily a scientist and<br />\nhead\u2022 of one of the greatest Universities of<br />\nthe world, he is at the same time a man of<br />\nwarm heart, great personal magnetism and<br />\ndeep human interest, and it is this that endears him to the students.<br />\n. `!In a conversation with President Remsen<br /><br />\na few days ago he spoke most interestingly<br />\nof our Island Empire and the war we are<br />\nwaging with Russia. 'Japan,' he said,'wants<br />\nto expand, and this is necessary because of<br />\nthe dense population of the islands; but Russia, too, wants an ice-free port in Manchuria.<br />\nBoth countries moving in the same direction<br />\nmade war inevitable, and now that it has<br />\ncome, there are many reasons why I should<br />\nlike to see Japan the victor. But I am<br />\nnaturally prejudiced in favor of the Japanese because so many of your prominent<br />\nmen have been educated at the Johns Hopkins. Among the first to come here was Dr.<br />\nKuhara, then Drs. Mitsukuri, Sato, Motara,<br />\nNakaseko, Nitohe\u2014all Ph. D.'s of this institution. Many others have been students<br />\nhere, but these men I know well, and from<br />\nthem I hav,e learned to admire the Jap, not<br />\nonly as a student, but as a man. I have .<br />\nno unfriendly feeling toward Russia, but the<br />\nvery fact that these and other students of<br />\nyour nationality have been identified with<br />\nthe Hopkins and-have been diligent students<br />\nand have taken their degrees here makes me<br />\nfeel, as it were, that they are the children of<br />\nour University. It may not be scientific or<br />\nrational to think this way, and it is certainly<br />\nnot impartial, but the same thing may be<br />\nsaid of patriotism.<br />\n\"'The yellow peril? Yes, it is dangerous<br />\nif Japan is victorious, and so influences China<br />\nthat the two, acting together, close the seaports of the Orient for their own selfish ends.<br />\nHowever, I cannot believe that this will happen, for Japan, though victorious, is too<br />\ncivilized to take such a step, and so antagonize the rest of the civilized world. Japan<br />\nhas always\u2022 been progressive, 'and she has<br />\nstood for the open-door policy in the East,<br />\nand as .each year your country is assimilating more and more of Western civilization,<br />\nand thus identifying her interests with those<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nst<br />\n\"--46..1001=010<br /><br />\n31<br /><br />\nXi It\u00b07-E A lc<br /><br />\nri 0<br />\nV a<br />\n.- 1L<br />\n-7.<br />\n.ffiriff -TI a Y.. lc v) * A gc o)_.<br />\n;% c_F _i '1ti ; IL (\u00bb iiit di<br />\n7 lc 1-i * t't f),5 -t 144 1E iiiri 0, iTi 11 h- tiii firi 6 :;t,<br />\n)<br />\nfil lt: (<br /><br />\nic ilt a 4)4<br />\n7 6 . t '-;':<br />\nt lc\u00b06 A-v- Is'' Pft filS ta \u2014 ()<br />\nM.

It has often been noted that<br />\nthe Americans, as a whole, take part with<br />\nJapan rather than with Russia. The explanation is simple\u2014they do not like the<br />\nRussian form of government. The Americans live under free institutions, and they<br />\ncannot sympathize with the arbitrary and<br />\ntyrannical methods pursued by the Russian<br />\nGovernment. It is not the outbreaks of violence, which sometimes result in massacre,<br />\nfor these are the exceptions.

LOUIS.<br />\nThe exhibits of the University and Medical<br />\nSchool in the Education and Social Economy<br />\nBuilding at the World's Fair, as usual, is<br />\nsuperior to the other college and university<br />\nexhibits. While these other institutions devote much space to pictures of the buildings,<br />\nathletic teams, etc., the Hopknis exhibits<br />\nshow the work that is being done in the<br />\nUniversity. The Medical School has a fine<br />\nset of pictures of the investigations carried<br />\non there; the geological department, although its main exhibit is in the Mines and<br />\nMetallurgy Building, is, nevertheless, briefly,<br />\nbut well represented. The physical laboratory has exhibited a number of Prof. Rowland's machines, together with several of<br />\nhis diffraction gratings\u2014the one with twenty<br />\nthousand lines to the inch being the msot<br />\nnoteworthy.<br />\nIn addition to these exhibits, all the publications of the University are to be seen.<br /><br />\nSeveral other small exhibits, including that<br />\nof the Semitic department are also exhibited.<br />\nAn important omission is that of the chemical department. Although this department<br />\nhas now more students than any other department in the University, no attempt has<br />\nbeen made to show the magnificent work<br />\nnow being done here in that line.<br />\nAnother thing which perhaps most of the<br />\nHopkins students visiting this exhibit have<br />\nnoticed is that there is no book in which to<br />\nregister. This may seem a small matter to<br />\nsome, but, nevertheless, it would have been<br />\nmade good use of if it had been there.<br /><br />\nTHE FIGURE 4.<br />\nI am not as superstitious<br />\nAs some men are wont to be,<br />\nAnd I do not care a pebble<br />\nFor the hoot owl up the tree;<br />\nE'en the wood has known no rappings,<br />\nThough I've boasted o'er and o'er,<br />\nBut somehow there's something awful<br />\n'Bout that beastly figure 4.<br />\nIt pursues me in the night time,<br />\nWhen the lamp is burning low,<br />\nWand'ring up and down my history<br />\nAs I turn the pages slow;<br />\nGrowing deeper, darker, plainer,<br />\nAs the lesson's end I near,<br />\nTill at last I close the pages,<br />\nSneak to bed in chilly fear.<br />\nAnd through all my college courses,<br />\nDoes that ghastly figure stay,<br />\nThough I've tried full hard to conquer,<br />\nTried by night-time and by day.<br />\nStill with wicked looks it follows,<br />\nClouding o'er my courses dark,<br />\nTill the very worst has happened,<br />\nAnd it turns into a mark.<br />\nWould that I could juggle figures,<br />\nChange the loaded, fateful die,<br />\nThen no more would this dire phantom<br />\nFlit before my frenzied eye;<br />\nAh, no longer would I worry,<br />\nFor no sooner said than done,<br />\nWould the 4 of all my troubles,<br />\nPass into the figure 1.<br />\n'06.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nTHE ANNUAL RUSH.<br />\nThe rush between the Junior and Freshman classes, on the first day of the new<br />\ncollegiate year, has hitherto been an illegal<br />\nand forbidden amusement which the classes<br />\nengaged in at their peril, knowing that the<br />\ncollege authorities would use every means<br />\nto enforce quiet in the University's precincts. As a result, the struggle, broken<br />\noff in one place, often renewed itself at a<br />\nsafer distance from the University. Even<br />\nhere, armed intervention was a probability,<br />\nand the contest was apt, therefore, to reach<br />\nan unsatisfactory and inconclusive termination, each side feeling that if it had been<br />\nallowed to fight it out, the result would have<br />\nbeen highly gratifying and most honorable<br />\nto itself. In addition to this disadvantage,<br />\nthere was offered to the public of Baltimore<br />\nthe edifying spectacle of a busy thoroughfare blocked by a struggling melee in which<br />\nwere mingled a large number of young gentlemen who proceeded to throw each other<br />\nabout violently, and to denude each other<br />\nof important garments; a squad of more or<br />\nless helpless policemen who rushed aimlessly<br />\naround the outskirts arresting bystanders<br />\nand inoffensive freshmen who preferred to<br />\nstand on the edge of the fight and look on.<br />\nAll this display was very undesirable, of<br />\ncourse. When \"the Hopkins gets to Homewood\" all these little affairs can be settled<br />\nrespectably and privately on the spacious<br />\ncampus. At present, however, we lack that<br />\nvaluable field for operations, and some way<br />\nhas to be found to make up for its absence.<br /><br />\nThis year, therefore, it was decided to<br />\nauthorize the affair and allow it to be held<br />\nprivately in the cage, thus avoiding publicity, and the overworking of the police in<br />\norder to keep the sidewalks open.<br />\nThe<br />\nwhole business with its status established<br />\ncame off without a hitch. The gymnasium<br />\nwalls shut out the public, and the two classes<br />\nsettled their accounts with each other in<br />\ndecent privacy, while the seniors present saw<br />\nto the proper conduct of things, and stopped<br />\nthe fight when it had gone far enough. It<br />\nis probable that the same arrangement will<br />\nbe made next year, since it worked so well<br />\nthis time. Of course, the dirty floor of the<br />\ncage is not as good to roll on as the grass'<br />\nof the Homewood campus, but it is certainly<br />\nan improvement on the brick pavement of<br />\nHoward Street. As a temporary expedient<br />\nthe cage is certainly very satisfactory. In<br />\ntime the University will offer greater convenience, for such affairs.<br />\nREFUSED.<br />\nI met the sweetest summer girl,<br />\nAnd it was so enraging,<br />\nThat though she was attractive quite,<br />\nShe wouldn't be engaging.<br />\nA.

U.; or box 16, Medical School.<br /><br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nAs will be noticed, the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nmakes its first appearance for the academic<br />\nyear in an entirely new cover. The question of a new cover has been before the<br />\nBoard for some time\u2014in fact, the subject<br />\nwas broached last spring. Owing to the<br />\npaper's loss in the fire, however, it was decided to get along with a plain one until<br />\nthe end of the year.<br />\nSeveral other features which we hope will<br />\nbe for the best interests of the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nwill also be noticed. We believe the paper<br />\nshould have a larger circulation among the<br />\nMedical students, the graduates, and the<br />\nalumni of the University than at present.<br />\nFor this reason, we have secured representatives in the first two departments who have<br />\npromised to contribute anything of interest.<br />\nFor the alumni notes, we are dependent upon<br />\ncharity. If the alumni would bear in mind<br />\nthat charity begins at their Alma Mater, the<br />\ncolumn would doubtless be much longer.<br />\nThey are urged most strongly to send in any<br />\nalumni notes at any time this fall.<br />\nThe Board loses two excellent men\u2014both<br />\nof them hard and consistent workers. Mr.<br />\nMurkland has been especially close to the<br />\nEditor and the latter wishes to thank him in<br />\nthe name of the Board for his hearty cooperation. Mr. Baetjer has had a no less<br /><br />\nresponsible position in looking out for the<br />\nfinancial end of the NEWS-LETTER, and has<br />\nalways had the welfare of the paper at<br />\nheart.<br />\nThe retirement of these two men leaves<br />\ntwo vacancies; one of the assistant businessmanager, and one of assistant news-editor.<br />\nBoth places are open to students in the<br />\nFreshman and Junior classes. Several men<br />\nare already trying for these places; out of<br />\nthe large Freshman class there ought to be<br />\na larger number than ever trying for the<br />\ntwo places. There will be another vacancy<br />\nnext month and several more at Easter, when<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER passes into the hands of<br />\nthe present Junior class.<br />\nThe apathy of the athletic board towards<br />\nfootball, at least, and from talk heard around<br />\nthe University towards baseball, we judge,<br />\nis a thing of the past. All who are acquainted with the athletic situation will acknowledge that there is great difficulty to be surmounted in re-establishing these sports on<br />\na firm foundation; yet the NEWS-LETTER<br />\nfirmly believes that what has been done this<br />\nfall could and should have been done over<br />\na year. ago. For this reason, it is perhaps<br />\nfortunate, a new board in sympathy with<br />\nthis go-ahead-spirit has been elected.<br />\nThat the new board, if it push forward<br />\nthe project vigorously, will have the goodwill and support of the majority of students<br />\nis very evident from the discussion on the<br />\nsubject heard around the University.<br />\nIt is too early to say anything about baseball, but the football season\u2014late as the<br />\nmovement for a team took definite shape\u2014<br />\nhas already opened. A fairly good schedule<br />\nhas been made out, considering that the management had to accept what dates it could<br />\nget.<br />\nMr. Janney and the other gentlemen who<br />\nare taking an active interest in this new<br />\nmovement are the kind of alumni that the<br />\nUniversity needs. Their support means a<br />\ngreat deal to the success of the teams, and<br />\nit is to be sincerely hoped that their interest<br />\nis the beginning of an active campaign in<br />\nother fields. ,<br />\nIn speaking of football, the NEws-LETTER<br />\nhas been promised an article dealing with<br />\nthe history of the game here from the time<br />\nwhen Hopkins lined up against Pennsylvania<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nand Princeton down to the present time. medical students\u2014both of which can be<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER considers itself very for- found in the annual register\u2014have been very<br />\ntunate in getting an article by one so well properly dispensed, with.

In<br />\nfact, so much brighter than what the<br />\nmanagement had even dared hope for, when<br />\non October 3 the small band of undergraduate students enthusiastically declared for a<br />\nteam, that they have just cause to feel elated.<br />\nOn that date the students met to decide the<br />\nquestion. The difficulties that had to be<br />\nfaced\u2014the lateness in the season to arrange<br />\na schedule, the inability of the \"meds\" to<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nget out ,an inexperienced bunch of undergraduates from which to draw, and finally<br />\nno visible practice grounds, were enough to<br />\nstagger the most sanguine; but Mr. Steuart<br />\nJanney, well known in Hopkins athletics<br />\na few years back, was present, and in ringing words of encouragement aroused the<br />\ndormant spirits of the fellows to such a<br />\nstate of activity that a manager and a captain were immediately elected.<br />\nThe next Wednesday a special meeting of<br />\nthe Athletic Board was held and the football<br />\nteam officially recognized. Before this, however, the medical and graduate departments<br />\nwere thoroughly scoured in quest of men,<br />\n\"stars\" of undergraduate days were located,<br />\nand after the exact situation was put clearly<br />\nand forcibly before them, they expressed a<br />\nwillingness to do all they could in the way<br />\nof giving active support. The first day out<br />\nwitnessed two full teams on the field. The<br />\nnext day brought a still larger number, and<br />\nSO many men turned up last Wednesday that<br />\nManager Straughn could not supply them<br />\nwith clothes.<br />\nIseman, in the third year of the medical<br />\ndepartment, is head coach of the team, and<br />\nhe declares that the material from which<br />\nhe has to draw is far superior to any he<br />\nhas seen since he came to Hopkins. Mr.<br />\nHorace Whitman is also giving his services<br />\nto bring the men into shape.<br />\nThe management has also partly obviated<br />\nanother serious drawback by being able to<br />\nget Oriole Park baseball grounds for practice. But still the medical men find it exacting upon them to get out there in time;<br />\nyet if the men of the undergraduate departments will stick to the team by coming out<br />\nand furnishing practice games for the 'Varsity as faithfully as the \"meds\" and the<br />\n\"grads,\" the season will pan out all right.<br />\nIt is still a little early to annuonce the<br />\ncomplete schedule, but this will be done as<br />\n_ soon as possible.<br /><br />\nTRACK AND FIELD OUTLOOK.<br />\nAt present, the outlook for a track meet<br />\nbefore the first of February is not bright.<br />\nThis is due to the fact that the Fifth Regiment Armory is now occupied by one of the<br />\nleading business firms here in the city, and<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nbecause of this, it will not be obtainable for<br />\nthe purpose of holding track meets.<br />\nOwing to this fact, Captain Hill, of the<br />\ntrack team, will n6t have the men out for<br />\npractice before the first of January. If<br />\nperchance, though it seems improbable at<br />\nthe present time, a meet of any importance<br />\nis to be held in Washington, Captain Hill<br />\nwill issue calls for candidates, and will begin<br />\nregular practice at once.<br />\nIt is to be regretted that it will be impossible to have another meet before the expiration of this year, for the men will have had<br />\nless training.<br />\nNevertheless, it is to be hoped that when<br />\nthe regular work begins, the men will put<br />\nspirit in their practice, and go through the<br />\nseason with flying colors as they have done<br />\nin former years, and end up with the capture of a third banner from Virginia.<br /><br />\nEXCHANGES.<br />\nShe\u2014I think Flossie will make a model<br />\nwife, don't you?<br />\nlie\u2014Yes, they say that she married an<br />\nartist.<br />\n\u2014Yale Record.<br />\n\"Foiled,\" muttered the yeast-cake as it<br />\nwas being wrapped in its glittering cover.<br />\n\u2014Yale Record.<br />\nThere was a young girl from Great Br.<br />\nWhose beau was eternally sp.<br />\nShe said, \"You quit chewing;<br />\nOr there'll be something doing;<br />\nIt simply means quit or the mt.\"<br />\n\u2014Sphinx.<br />\nA skittish young mare<br />\nGot more than her share<br />\nOf fright from an automobile;<br />\nWhen her driver came to<br />\nHe found her front shoe<br />\nAnd a hub with some spokes of a wheel.<br />\n\u2014Jester.<br />\nWhat Hans' idea of Heaven is<br />\nWe don't know very well;<br />\nFor he looks up in the sky,<br />\nHe says, \"Der Himmel ist hell.\"<br />\n\u2014Cornell Widow.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n10<br /><br />\nIN THE GRADUATE DEPARTMENTS.<br />\nMrs. Sidney Lanier and Mary E.

The first exercises of the day were<br />\nheld in the Clinical Amphitheatre of the<br />\nnew building, where a number of most interesting addresses were delivered to an<br />\naudience that over-flowed the auditorium,<br />\nand was composed of officers and professors<br />\nof the University, distinguished guests from<br />\nmany places, and a large number of the<br />\nprominent physicians and surgeons of the<br />\ncity. Following this meeting an excellent<br />\nluncheon was served in the Administration<br />\nBuilding, and further exercises were held in<br />\nthe afternoon, upon the unveiling of a tablet<br />\nto Dr. Lazear, who devoted his life to the<br />\ninvestigation of yellow fever.<br />\nThe building itself is one of the finest,<br />\nmost modern, and best equipped of its kind<br />\nnow in operation anywhere. The most striking thing is the Surgical Amphitheatre on<br />\nthe top floor. Practically the whole north<br />\nwall, and half the roof of this room are<br />\nof heavy glass plates, providing a light that<br />\nis most necessary in such a clinic. The operating table is placed directly under this huge<br />\nsky-light, and in a semi-circle about it are<br />\nthe students' seats, ascending in steep tiers,<br />\nso that the closer seats are overlooked by<br />\nthose further back.<br />\nDr. William Osler delivered the last Ingersoll lecture at Harvard.

In its _columns are<br />\nto be found a summary of the activities of<br />\nthe students; athletics, musical clubs, college<br />\nhappenings\u2014all these claim notice. Most of<br />\nthis class of news is collected by the reportorial staff of the magazine; the literary<br />\npart, such as editorials, poetry, etc., is left<br />\nentirely to the editorial staff, and students,<br />\nunconnected with the magazine, seldom, if<br />\never, contribute. On the part of the editors<br />\nit is a question of getting copy; on the part<br />\nof the outside student, it is merely a question of a little extra work, and if the result<br />\nis meritorious, he has the undeniable pleasure<br />\nof seeing his work in print.<br />\nOf course, training is necessary to be able<br />\nto write an article possessing interest to the<br />\nstudent reader. A scholarly paper on some<br />\nabstruse subject won't \"take\" half as well<br />\nas an amusing incident, cleverly told. In fact,<br />\nhumor and clever expression are indispensable features of a successful article. The<br />\nonly way to acquire this training is to practice.<br />\nThere are two fields for practice open to<br />\nthe average undergraduate. Most students<br />\nknow by the end of their freshman-year what<br />\nis one of the ways. But that practice is<br />\ndevoted to polite literature and to rhetoric.<br />\nThe other field is the college-paper. If undergraduates would write up every \"grind\"<br />\nand happy thought that occurred to him in<br />\na day, the editors would find that selection<br />\ninstead of copy-writing would be their chief<br />\nworry.<br />\nThe training derived from a little practice<br />\nnow and then, with the subsequent disappointment of having one's manuscript returned, thereby spurring one to higher efforts, would be invaluable to many a future<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" editor. I am sure that if more<br />\nmen contributed to the NEWS-LETTER, it<br />\nwould not be necessary for \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\neditors to write most of the \"stuff,\" and<br />\nmuch of the conventionality of a college<br />\nyear-book would be lacking. As it is, most<br />\nof the work is done by a few men, and the<br />\nwork is often on the same lines.<br />\nThe magazine offers an opportunity for<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nillustrators, so that when a call for illustrations for a \"Hullabaloo\" is made, the<br />\neditors won't find it necessary to utilize<br />\noutside help in a student publication. There<br />\nwould be also more of a representation of<br />\nthe whole school in such a \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\nthan in the case of recent class books.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER offers an opportunity<br />\nfor the development of untrained talent.<br />\nThe editors,' I am sure, will be thankful for<br />\nall contributions whether they use them or<br />\nnot. Let every man try to write one article<br />\nto the NEWS-LETTER so that when the \"Hullabaloo\" editors call for contributions they<br />\nwill be embarassed by the quantity and not<br />\nashamed of the quality.<br />\n[This was not written by a member of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER staff nor was it solicited.<br />\nIt came as an entire but welcome surprise].<br /><br />\nUNDERGRADUATE NOTES.<br />\nThe Junior Class has elected the following<br />\nofficers to serve for the coming year:\u2014<br />\nPresident, Carl K.
