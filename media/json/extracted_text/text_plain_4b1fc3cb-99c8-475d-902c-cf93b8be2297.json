It<br />\nwas such good news that every seat<br />\nwas occupied.<br />\nThe bell rang, the noise faded to a<br />\nmurmur, and then Dr Mitchell spoke:<br />\n\"I don't know what brought this<br />\non, but I am delighted to have such<br />\nresponsive talent this morning. We<br />\nhave been studying the primary<br />\ncauses of the industrial revolution<br />\nand since you have such eagerness to<br />\nlearn, you shall certainly get the opportunity.\"<br />\nThe visiting students held their<br />\nbreath, then Dr Mitchell continued:<br />\n\"The inequality of wealth distribution has frequently been condemned. It is estimated that one<br />\nfamily out of every 400 on the average has as much income as the other<br />\n399 put together.\"<br />\n\"It would cost approximately $13<br />\na week for a family of four to be put<br />\non direct relief. Let us bear this point<br />\nin mind, for we will return to it.<br />\n\"Now, just what did this cotillion<br />\ncost?\" The Students gave a sigh of<br />\nrelief. Dr Mitchell got up, prepared<br />\nto write on the board. He inquired<br />\nhow many people attended the dance.<br />\nThe number given by one of the students in the class, was 1,147 people,<br />\n75 debutantes. In round numbers<br />\nthere were 800 men and 400 women<br />\npresent. He then proceeded to obtain<br />\na list of the items for this dance, with<br />\nestimated cost of each.<br />\nIn the calculating of the cost of<br />\ncertain garments which might be<br />\nworn more than once, only a part of<br />\nthe cost was allocated to this dance.<br />\nThe debutantes were at variance<br />\nupon the price of food. The one said<br />\n$1.25 a plate while the other maintained $.50. Dr Mitchell looked over<br />\nto the one and said:<br />\n\"If it was just a snack? The young<br />\nlady said she had a sandwich.\"<br />\n\"I didn't say that\" she replied.<br />\nFinally the debutantes compromised<br />\nand the price was set at $1.00 a plate,<br />\na total of $1200.<br />\nThey disagreed again about the<br />\nprice of boxes of flowers.

When Bob<br />\nlatched off on these fast tunes, though<br />\nthere wasn't much dancing going on,<br />\nthe crowd gathered around the bandstand where Bob Barber, ace trombonist of the Craig outfit, took a<br />\ncouple of licks on his slide horn.<br />\nComments<br />\n\"Tell the freshmen and sophs<br />\nthanks for supporting the dance,\"<br />\nsmiled George L Miller carrying a<br />\ncocktail in either hand and appearing entirely satisfied with everything.<br />\n\"We might not have made a mint<br />\nof money,\" crated Harry Nance in<br />\ntrue Ciceronian fashion, \"but because<br />\nof the support of the student to<br />\ntheir class and because of the fine<br />\nshow of spirit at the dance\", he broke<br />\noff here, hesitated, wet his finger<br />\nwth his tongue, and pressed it into<br />\nthe palm of his other hand and<br />\nlaughed, \"Oh, what fun!\"<br />\nThe friendly informal attitude of<br />\nNance and Miller seemed to be<br />\ntypical of the whole affair. The affair<br />\nwas presented in cabaret style.<br /><br />\nby A. LEROY SWERDLOFF<br />\nWhen a dog bites a man or when a<br />\ndebutante comes to Dr. Mitchell's<br />\nclass it's news.<br />\n'Twas the morning after the<br />\nBatchelor's cotillon and all over the<br />\nHopkins campus there was serenity<br />\ntill two debutantes visited Dr<br />\nMitchell's 9:30 class in economics. It<br />\nwas such good news that every seat<br />\nwas occupied.<br />\nThe bell rang, the noise faded to a<br />\nmurmur, and then Dr Mitchell spoke:<br />\n\"I don't know what brought this<br />\non, but I am delighted to have such<br />\nresponsive talent this morning. We<br />\nhave been studying the primary<br />\ncauses of the industrial revolution<br />\nand since you have such eagerness to<br />\nlearn, you shall certainly get the opportunity.\"<br />\nThe visiting students held their<br />\nbreath, then Dr Mitchell continued:<br />\n\"The inequality of wealth distribution has frequently been condemned. It is estimated that one<br />\nfamily out of every 400 on the average has as much income as the other<br />\n399 put together.\"<br />\n\"It would cost approximately $13<br />\na week for a family of four to be put<br />\non direct relief. Let us bear this point<br />\nin mind, for we will return to it.<br />\n\"Now, just what did this cotillion<br />\ncost?\" The Students gave a sigh of<br />\nrelief. Dr Mitchell got up, prepared<br />\nto write on the board. He inquired<br />\nhow many people attended the dance.<br />\nThe number given by one of the students in the class, was 1,147 people,<br />\n75 debutantes. In round numbers<br />\nthere were 800 men and 400 women<br />\npresent. He then proceeded to obtain<br />\na list of the items for this dance, with<br />\nestimated cost of each.<br />\nIn the calculating of the cost of<br />\ncertain garments which might be<br />\nworn more than once, only a part of<br />\nthe cost was allocated to this dance.<br />\nThe debutantes were at variance<br />\nupon the price of food. The one said<br />\n$1.25 a plate while the other maintained $.50. Dr Mitchell looked over<br />\nto the one and said:<br />\n\"If it was just a snack? The young<br />\nlady said she had a sandwich.\"<br />\n\"I didn't say that\" she replied.<br />\nFinally the debutantes compromised<br />\nand the price was set at $1.00 a plate,<br />\na total of $1200.<br />\nThey disagreed again about the<br />\nprice of boxes of flowers. One said<br />\n$5 the other $3, whereupon Dr<br />\nMitchell explained the difference was<br />\nbetween the liberal and conservative.<br />\nThe liquor queStion was reached.<br />\nThe students agreed that 600 pints<br />\nwould be a fair figure.<br />\n\"Oh, no, not that much liquor!\"<br />\none of the debutantes answered,<br />\n\"They had mostly White Rock, carbonated water.\"<br /><br />\n\"What<br /><br />\nabout<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nchampagne?\"<br /><br />\nsome one remarked.<br />\n\"Oh<br /><br />\nthe<br /><br />\nchampagne<br /><br />\ndidn't last<br /><br />\nvery long\" she retorted.<br />\nWhen Dr Mitchell was questioning the girls- about the cost of various pieces of women's clothing and<br />\nincidentals used at the dance there<br />\nwould<br /><br />\ninfrequently<br /><br />\nbe<br /><br />\ndisturbing<br /><br />\nmurmurs about how low some of the<br />\nprices were set. Dr Mitchell invariably had to stop to tell them.<br />\n\"Now wait a minute, you don't<br />\nknow anything about women's dresses.\"<br />\n\"There are a lot of things which<br />\nshow up very well but really didn't<br />\ncost much.\" commented a debutante.<br />\n\"Indeed,\" Dr Mitchell added, \"I've<br />\nheard that at some hunting clubs you<br />\ncould get a good deal of second hand<br />\nthings: you could get a second hand<br />\nsaddle, a second hand pair of boots<br />\nand even a second hand fox.\" \u2022<br />\n\"What about the railroad fare?\"<br />\nquestioned a student. Wouldn't those<br />\npeople coming from New York have<br />\nto pay a fare?<br />\n\"That is a good point\" affirmed Dr<br />\nMitchell, \"a lot of these people are<br />\nfrom foreign countries like---Catonsville.<br />\nThe following list is the approximate value of the terns which were<br />\ndetermined. \"It is by no means an<br />\nexact list\" said Dr Mitchell.<br />\n$400 for rental, $1200 food, $1000<br />\norchestra, $50 decorations, $1000<br />\ncorsages, $24,000 flowers, $100 parties, $600 liquor, $2400 railroad, $600<br />\ntax, $3200 dresses, $200 shoes, $160<br />\nstockings, $800 undies, $200 wraps,<br />\n$700 hairaressers, $125 manicures,<br />\n$800 men's suits, $2000 vests, shirts,<br />\nties, etc., $2000 jewelry, $200 men's<br />\ncoats, hats, $200 women's gloves,<br />\n$2500 invitations and cards, $800 tips<br />\nand $1500 for hotels. Total\u2014$49,430<br />\nor approximately $650 per debutante<br />\nwas spent.<br />\nWhen we return to the original<br />\nstatement that $13 would support<br />\na family of four people on relief for<br />\none week, we discover that 50 families<br />\nfor one week could be supported by<br />\nthe money spent on each debutante.<br />\nOr a relief population (two families<br />\nto the house) filling the area between<br />\nCharles street to Harford road and<br />\nNorth avenue to 32nd street, could be<br />\nsupported for one week.<br />\nThe point of the lecture is whether<br />\nit is advantageous to stimulate such<br />\nbusiness since many people might<br />\nsay that the florists and hairdressers<br />\netc., had to be kept alive, while people<br />\nin the society are starving for food.<br />\nAt this point the bell rang ending<br />\nthis delightful period.<br /><br />\nJ B Lawrence<br /><br />\nin this corner<br />\nI write this paragraph on Dec 4;<br />\nit may or may not be published before Christmas, regardless of the sympathy and wishes of the editor and,<br />\nI am led to believe, a majority of the<br />\nN-L board. Not yet this school year<br />\nhas this column appeared within two<br />\nweeks of submission. Twice it has<br />\nbeen mysteriously lost in the N-L<br />\noffice where the forces of liberalism<br />\nmake their terrestrial home. Because<br />\nof the state of anarchy existing<br />\namong the editorial staff, two or<br />\nthree obstructionist underlings, cringing in fear of an outbreak of independent thought have resorted to<br />\nsurreptitious sabotage, and even to<br />\noiirright, brazen suppression. They<br />\nhave created a real need for the<br />\nschool motto; but campus opinion<br />\ncannot be made free, if truth itself<br />\nis gagged and fettered. This paper<br />\nhas ceased to represent a cross-section of campus opinion; instead, a<br />\nminority of malcontents has corrupted the ideals of journalism by their<br />\npetty totalitarianism.<br />\nTHREE out of four fighters for<br />\npure principle who sat on the platform at the the-dean-is-unwise-butwe-love-him meeting are members of<br />\nthe ASU. The demonstration was informed that the speakers represented a certain \"Committee of Thirty.\"<br />\nI do not believe that the ASU has a<br />\nlarge enough membership to fill threefourths quota on such a committee,<br />\nbut it may be assumed that they did<br />\nthe best they could. Must we accept<br />\nsuch a percentage as representative<br />\nof the campus, and if not, where is all<br />\ntheir beloved democracy, whose name<br />\nthey take in vain? Note that practically all the revolutions in history<br />\nwere formented by self-seeking minorities who duped the masses with<br />\ntempting catchwords of idealism.<br />\nThen as now, these self-appointed<br />\npopular leaders represented no one<br />\nbut themselves and their personal interests.<br />\nThe face of the N-L was badly<br /><br />\nblackened by a recent headline therein Hearstly referred to the \"Jap<br />\nPolicy.\" This is disgraceful and inexcusable. Brevity cannot be used as<br />\nan explanation; if such an argument<br />\nis admissable, why not go the whole<br />\nhog?
