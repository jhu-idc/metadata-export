The Planning Com-<br />\nmission was unhappy over this situation, but it appeared that no other<br />\nsolution was feasible. Upon advice from the Department of Public Works<br />\nthat a decision was necessary to avoid delay in the design of the Jones<br />\nFalls Expressway, the Planning Commission reluctantly approved the pro-<br />\nposed interchange design, informally in January of 1958, and formally<br />\nin May.<br />\n<br />\nFour months later, on September 17, 1958, the Planning Commission<br />\ndecided to reconsider this decision and instructed its staff to restudy the<br />\ninterchange problem in the hope that a feasible scheme could be developed<br />\nthat would allow the East-West Expressway to be depressed through the<br />\nMt. Vernon area. The Commission\u2019s reconsideration was a result of<br />\nseveral developments. In the first place, it became apparent that the need<br />\nfor a decision on the interchange was not as urgent as it had previously<br />\nappeared.

This committee,<br />\ngenerally referred to as the Bonnell Committee, was intended to serve as<br />\na means for thrashing out differences of opinion on the expressway pro-<br />\ngram and for reaching agreements among all of the officials concerned.<br />\nWhile it was in existence the committee did resolve some unsettled points<br />\nin the design of the Jones Falls Expressway, but it was less successful on<br />\nreaching agreements on the East-West Expressway.<br />\n<br />\nWith respect to the interchange between the two expressways the<br />\ncommittee reviewed the latest traffic analysis figures prepared by Mr.<br />\nHenry A.
