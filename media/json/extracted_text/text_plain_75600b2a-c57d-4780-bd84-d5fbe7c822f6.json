The<br />\ngrades in the Faculty of Philosophy at<br />\npresent are professor, associate professor, associate instructor.<br />\nThere is not the slightest uniformity<br />\nin the salaries of those in any one<br />\ngrade; and as a consequence each man<br />\non the faculty feels free to ask for<br />\nan increase in salary each year, and<br />\neach professor feels free to urge such<br />\nincreases for the younger men on his<br />\nstaff. There is, therefore, constant<br />\npressure to raise all salaries.<br />\nCites Logical Consequences<br />\nThe logical consequences of this<br />\npractically permanent tenure of office<br />\nand of the pressure to promote from<br />\none grade to another and to increase<br />\nsalaries are as follows:<br />\n1. The University will have on<br />\nits faculty all those men who<br />\nare not called to other institutions.<br />\n2. There will be only professors.<br />\n3. There will be no money to add<br />\nnew men to the staff.<br />\nThe entire situation seems to me to<br />\nbe wrong and to be one of the reasons<br />\nfor the present financial condition.<br />\n<br />\nFive specific recommendations<br />\nthen follow. They are: (1) to reduce the number of grades to three<br />\n\u2014professor and two others; (2) to<br />\ncontinue the tenure of office of a<br />\nprofessor as indefinite,. but to make<br />\nthat of the other two grades five<br />\nyears, with \"the express understanding that only in the higher of these<br />\nis a man eligible for re-appointment<br />\nand then only as an exception\"; (3)<br />\nto determine the salary of each professorship and consider it fixed, except for special considerations, and<br />\nto fix minimum and maximum salaries for the other two grades, the<br />\nmaximum to be approached by increases of $100. each year; (4) to<br />\nadopt for the appointment of men<br />\nto the higher of the two grades the<br />\nsame procedure now employed for<br />\nthe appointment of professors; (5)<br />\nto allocate to each department a definite part of the total sum available<br />\nfor salaries, and thereafter to make<br />\npromotions and appointments in that<br />\ndepartment only when additional<br />\nfunds shall be available.<br />\nPlan Preferable<br />\n<br />\n\"Unless some such plan is<br />\nadopted,\" remarked Dr. Ames, \"it<br />\nwill be impossible to balance a budget or to keep it balanced.\" He regards the adoption of such a plan as<br />\ngreatly preferable to attempts to<br />\nbalance the budget by cutting salaries or appropriations for the purchase of books and equipment.<br />\nWithout reference to the budget,<br />\nbut with a view to strengthening the<br />\ninternal organization of the faculty<br />\nthe President makes two other recommendations: first, to arrange the<br />\nduties of the staff in such a manner<br />\nas to increase, rather than decrease,<br />\nthe teaching duties of a man who has<br />\nreached the age of fifty-five, so as<br />\nto leave the younger men more time<br />\nfor their individual work; and, second, rigid enforcement of the rule<br />\nof enforced retirement at the age<br />\n<br />\nTHE FALL ASSORTMENTS OF CLOTHES AND HABERDASHERY<br />\nPRESENTED AT THIS TIME OFFER UNPRECEDENTED<br />\nOPPORTUNITIES<br />\n<br />\nFollowing the latter resolution,<br />\nwhich endorsed the activities of the<br />\nNational Student League, a branch<br />\nof this organization was formed at<br />\nthe Homewood campus.<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nRifle Club will start its activities<br />\nsoon after November 1, it was announced recently.

The advantages of such a rule<br />\nare sufficiently obvious; but I may<br />\nmention these:<br />\n\"1. An opportunity is thus offered, and only thus, for the<br />\nUniversity and the School<br />\nconcerned to review the work<br />\nof the department and to discuss freely plans for its improvement.<br />\n\"2. An opportunity is offered<br />\nto add new men to the staff.<br />\n\"3. So far as exceptions are<br />\nconcerned, one leads to another, and the President, who<br />\nultimately is responsible, is<br />\nplaced in a disagreeable, not<br />\nto say impossible, situation.\"<br />\nThese views are set forth as those<br />\nof the President individually. It is<br />\nexplained that before coming before the Board of Trustees for official action, they must be discussed<br />\nby the proper Academic Boards.<br />\nAt the beginning of his annual<br />\nreport, made yesterday afternoon,<br />\nDr. Ames states:<br />\nThe necessity for securing more<br />\nincome for each part of the University<br />\nand of practicing the utmost economy<br />\nis evident.<br />\nIt is probable that many will say<br />\nthat more than this is demanded, that<br />\nactual reductions in expenses must be<br />\nmade other than those implied by<br />\neconomy. The only reductions not<br />\nalready made in the budget for next<br />\nyear are possible ones in salaries and<br />\nin appropriations for the purchase of<br />\nbooks and laboratory supplies. These<br />\nreductions 1 cannot recommend to you.<br />\nBefore such a drastic step is taken,<br />\nI think that there are several matters<br />\nto be considered, all looking to reduction of expenses. It may be that it<br />\nwill be best not to fill those vacancies<br />\non the staff caused by death, retirement or resignation. It may be possible to rearrange the budgets of the<br />\nindividual departments so that reductions may be made in other ways than<br />\nby lowering of salaries. To indicate<br />\nwhat I mean by this last suggestion,<br />\nI shall describe the present organization and operation of a typical department in the Faculty of Philosophy and<br />\nstate certain proposals which I wish to<br />\nmake, proposals which before coming<br />\nto you officially will have to be discussed by the proper Academic<br />\nBoards.<br />\n<br />\n\"Nature in the Raw\"\u2014as portrayed<br />\nby the noted artist, Karl Godwin<br />\n.inspired by the fierce and brilliant assault by Clive and a handful of followers, outnumbered 20<br />\nto 1 by savage hordes of bloodthirsty<br />\nnatives,atthe Battle ofPlassey\u2014 the<br />\nbirth of the British Indian Empire<br />\n\u2014as described in the famous Henty<br />\n<br />\nbook, \"With Clive in India.\"<br />\n<br />\nand raw tobaccos<br />\nhave no place in cigarettes<br />\nThey are not present in Luckies<br />\n... the mildest cigarette<br />\nyou ever smoked<br />\nE buy the finest, the very<br />\nW<br />\nfinest tobaccos in all the<br />\nworld\u2014but that does not<br />\nexplain why folks everywhere regard Lucky Strike as<br />\nthe mildest cigarette.The fact<br />\nis, we never overlook the<br />\ntruth that \"Nature in the<br />\nRaw is Seldom Mild\"\u2014 so<br />\n<br />\nthese fine tobaccos, after<br />\nproper aging and mellowing,<br />\nare then given the benefit of<br />\nthat Lucky Strike purifying<br />\nprocess, described by the<br />\nwords\u2014\"It's toasted\".That's<br />\nwhy folks in every city, town<br />\nand hamlet say that Luckies<br />\nare such mild cigarettes.<br />\n<br />\n\"It's toasted\"<br />\nThat package of mild Luckies<br />\n<br />\n\"Ifa man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mousetrap than his neighbor, tho he<br />\nbuild his housein the woods, the world will make a beatenpath to his door.\"\u2014RALPH WALDO EMERSON.<br />\nDoes not this explain the world-wide acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "FALL LACROSSE TODAY<br />\nHOMEWOOD FIELD<br />\n4.00 P.

C.<br />\n0<br />\nwelcoming the members of the Na- tion of the R.<br />\ntional Student League.<br /><br />\nThe specified tenure of each of the<br />\nother grades is one year; but this obviously means nothing and each man<br />\nconfidently expects re-appointment;<br />\nand, in fact, I think each associate professor considers his tenure of office<br />\nas secure as that of a professor. The<br />\ngrades in the Faculty of Philosophy at<br />\npresent are professor, associate professor, associate instructor.<br />\nThere is not the slightest uniformity<br />\nin the salaries of those in any one<br />\ngrade; and as a consequence each man<br />\non the faculty feels free to ask for<br />\nan increase in salary each year, and<br />\neach professor feels free to urge such<br />\nincreases for the younger men on his<br />\nstaff. There is, therefore, constant<br />\npressure to raise all salaries.<br />\nCites Logical Consequences<br />\nThe logical consequences of this<br />\npractically permanent tenure of office<br />\nand of the pressure to promote from<br />\none grade to another and to increase<br />\nsalaries are as follows:<br />\n1. The University will have on<br />\nits faculty all those men who<br />\nare not called to other institutions.<br />\n2. There will be only professors.<br />\n3. There will be no money to add<br />\nnew men to the staff.<br />\nThe entire situation seems to me to<br />\nbe wrong and to be one of the reasons<br />\nfor the present financial condition.<br /><br />\nFive specific recommendations<br />\nthen follow. They are: (1) to reduce the number of grades to three<br />\n\u2014professor and two others; (2) to<br />\ncontinue the tenure of office of a<br />\nprofessor as indefinite,. but to make<br />\nthat of the other two grades five<br />\nyears, with \"the express understanding that only in the higher of these<br />\nis a man eligible for re-appointment<br />\nand then only as an exception\"; (3)<br />\nto determine the salary of each professorship and consider it fixed, except for special considerations, and<br />\nto fix minimum and maximum salaries for the other two grades, the<br />\nmaximum to be approached by increases of $100. each year; (4) to<br />\nadopt for the appointment of men<br />\nto the higher of the two grades the<br />\nsame procedure now employed for<br />\nthe appointment of professors; (5)<br />\nto allocate to each department a definite part of the total sum available<br />\nfor salaries, and thereafter to make<br />\npromotions and appointments in that<br />\ndepartment only when additional<br />\nfunds shall be available.<br />\nPlan Preferable<br /><br />\n\"Unless some such plan is<br />\nadopted,\" remarked Dr. Ames, \"it<br />\nwill be impossible to balance a budget or to keep it balanced.\" He regards the adoption of such a plan as<br />\ngreatly preferable to attempts to<br />\nbalance the budget by cutting salaries or appropriations for the purchase of books and equipment.<br />\nWithout reference to the budget,<br />\nbut with a view to strengthening the<br />\ninternal organization of the faculty<br />\nthe President makes two other recommendations: first, to arrange the<br />\nduties of the staff in such a manner<br />\nas to increase, rather than decrease,<br />\nthe teaching duties of a man who has<br />\nreached the age of fifty-five, so as<br />\nto leave the younger men more time<br />\nfor their individual work; and, second, rigid enforcement of the rule<br />\nof enforced retirement at the age<br /><br />\nTHE FALL ASSORTMENTS OF CLOTHES AND HABERDASHERY<br />\nPRESENTED AT THIS TIME OFFER UNPRECEDENTED<br />\nOPPORTUNITIES<br /><br />\nFollowing the latter resolution,<br />\nwhich endorsed the activities of the<br />\nNational Student League, a branch<br />\nof this organization was formed at<br />\nthe Homewood campus.<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nRifle Club will start its activities<br />\nsoon after November 1, it was announced recently.

The advantages of such a rule<br />\nare sufficiently obvious; but I may<br />\nmention these:<br />\n\"1. An opportunity is thus offered, and only thus, for the<br />\nUniversity and the School<br />\nconcerned to review the work<br />\nof the department and to discuss freely plans for its improvement.<br />\n\"2. An opportunity is offered<br />\nto add new men to the staff.<br />\n\"3. So far as exceptions are<br />\nconcerned, one leads to another, and the President, who<br />\nultimately is responsible, is<br />\nplaced in a disagreeable, not<br />\nto say impossible, situation.\"<br />\nThese views are set forth as those<br />\nof the President individually. It is<br />\nexplained that before coming before the Board of Trustees for official action, they must be discussed<br />\nby the proper Academic Boards.<br />\nAt the beginning of his annual<br />\nreport, made yesterday afternoon,<br />\nDr. Ames states:<br />\nThe necessity for securing more<br />\nincome for each part of the University<br />\nand of practicing the utmost economy<br />\nis evident.<br />\nIt is probable that many will say<br />\nthat more than this is demanded, that<br />\nactual reductions in expenses must be<br />\nmade other than those implied by<br />\neconomy. The only reductions not<br />\nalready made in the budget for next<br />\nyear are possible ones in salaries and<br />\nin appropriations for the purchase of<br />\nbooks and laboratory supplies. These<br />\nreductions 1 cannot recommend to you.<br />\nBefore such a drastic step is taken,<br />\nI think that there are several matters<br />\nto be considered, all looking to reduction of expenses. It may be that it<br />\nwill be best not to fill those vacancies<br />\non the staff caused by death, retirement or resignation. It may be possible to rearrange the budgets of the<br />\nindividual departments so that reductions may be made in other ways than<br />\nby lowering of salaries. To indicate<br />\nwhat I mean by this last suggestion,<br />\nI shall describe the present organization and operation of a typical department in the Faculty of Philosophy and<br />\nstate certain proposals which I wish to<br />\nmake, proposals which before coming<br />\nto you officially will have to be discussed by the proper Academic<br />\nBoards.<br /><br />\n\"Nature in the Raw\"\u2014as portrayed<br />\nby the noted artist, Karl Godwin<br />\n.inspired by the fierce and brilliant assault by Clive and a handful of followers, outnumbered 20<br />\nto 1 by savage hordes of bloodthirsty<br />\nnatives,atthe Battle ofPlassey\u2014 the<br />\nbirth of the British Indian Empire<br />\n\u2014as described in the famous Henty<br /><br />\nbook, \"With Clive in India.\"<br /><br />\nand raw tobaccos<br />\nhave no place in cigarettes<br />\nThey are not present in Luckies<br />\n... the mildest cigarette<br />\nyou ever smoked<br />\nE buy the finest, the very<br />\nW<br />\nfinest tobaccos in all the<br />\nworld\u2014but that does not<br />\nexplain why folks everywhere regard Lucky Strike as<br />\nthe mildest cigarette.The fact<br />\nis, we never overlook the<br />\ntruth that \"Nature in the<br />\nRaw is Seldom Mild\"\u2014 so<br /><br />\nthese fine tobaccos, after<br />\nproper aging and mellowing,<br />\nare then given the benefit of<br />\nthat Lucky Strike purifying<br />\nprocess, described by the<br />\nwords\u2014\"It's toasted\".That's<br />\nwhy folks in every city, town<br />\nand hamlet say that Luckies<br />\nare such mild cigarettes.<br /><br />\n\"It's toasted\"<br />\nThat package of mild Luckies<br /><br />\n\"Ifa man write a better book, preach a better sermon, or make a better mousetrap than his neighbor, tho he<br />\nbuild his housein the woods, the world will make a beatenpath to his door.\"\u2014RALPH WALDO EMERSON.<br />\nDoes not this explain the world-wide acceptance and approval of Lucky Strike?<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 38682, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "6ba19421-3915-4f3c-879d-280b9661b255", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/12359-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 12359, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "257f14ba-af3c-4249-8153-307fa466d0d6", "url": "/node/12359"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "49b47345-a0b3-42a6-9801-eeedd2d6245e"}]}
