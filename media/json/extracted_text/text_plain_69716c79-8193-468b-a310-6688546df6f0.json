The DoD,she said, purportedly gives universities access<br />\nto the foremost technology, provides more money than the<br />\ncivilian sector, and provides a<br />\nlong-term commitment.<br />\nIn contrast, she said, is the National Science Foundation, where<br />\nresearchers need to continually<br />\n<br />\nrenew their contracts.

Furthermore, Kistiakowsky believed<br />\nthat government tries to quell<br />\ncritics of its programs. \"When<br />\npeople get the money [to do<br />\nresearch], they buy into the<br />\nsystem,\" she said.<br />\nThe solution Kistiakowsky offered entailed government support for diversified basic research<br />\nbalanced with research of \"national priority.''<br />\nFeldman argued that militaryfunded research is not beneficial<br />\nto the U.S. economy. Feldman<br />\nattributed most of the U.S. trade<br />\ndeficit to excess government funding of weapons-geared research<br />\n\"because hi-tech capacity is<br />\ndiverted to the military.\"<br />\nFeldman accused universities<br />\nthat receive DoD funding of intentionally developing \"militarycentered undergraduate curricula.\" International relations,<br />\nhe believed, teaches arms control<br />\ntheory as a rationale for escalation of nuclear weapons. \"The<br />\nuniversity has become the supporting pillar for military intervention policy,\" he said.<br />\n\"Courses on comprehensive<br />\ndisarmament theory are not<br />\ngenerally available.\"<br />\nIn a pamphlet for the National<br />\n<br />\nCommission for Economic Conversion & Disarmament,<br />\nFeldman wrote, \"universities,<br />\nlike prime military contractors,<br />\nwill resist conversion [from<br />\nmilitary research to non-military,<br />\nbasic research] unless they are<br />\nforced by legal and political<br />\nmeans.\"<br />\nFeldman advocated the National Conversion Legislation<br />\ncurrently in Congress as a nonutopian way of weaning universities from dependence on DoD<br />\nfunding. If passed, the bill would<br />\nmake mandatory the formation of<br />\ncommittees that would plan a<br />\npeaceful agenda for research.<br />\nIf this bill were passed, said<br />\nFeldman, the trade deficit would<br />\nshrink because of a vast diversion<br />\nof resources from defense and<br />\ntoward<br />\nconsumer-oriented<br />\ntechnology, which would boost<br />\nthe marketability of U.S. goods<br />\nworldwide. Furthermore, the<br />\ncountry's welfare as a whole<br />\nwould improve as more dollars<br />\nwould be devoted to research on<br />\nrecycling and discovering alternate sources of energy.<br />\nHopkins' controversial Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab was, however, not<br />\nsignificantly mentioned in the<br />\nforum eventhough it receives<br />\nmuch of its funding from the<br />\nDoD. One professor did say, \"I<br />\nthink it's important for APL to<br />\nhave Hopkins [for the university's prestigious namej, but not for<br />\nHopkins to have APL.\" Hopkins<br />\nreceives a negligible amount of<br />\nincome from APL, which functions mostly independently from<br />\nthe university.<br />\n<br />\n4004444000044444040044040404<br />\n4(<br />\n<br />\nSelf Defense<br />\nWorkshop<br />\n<br />\nif2E<br />\n<br />\n444<br />\n4,<br />\n4,<br />\ntypographical<br />\nDue<br />\nto<br />\na<br />\nc'<br />\n.<br />\nMarch 12<br />\n*44,<br />\nerror in last week's<br />\n444<br />\n4:9.00<br />\nNews-Letter,<br />\nApplications for<br />\n.<br />\n4444, . a.m. to 4:00p.m.*:<br />\n***<br />\nOrientation Chair and<br />\n*<br />\n4,4,4,4.<br />\n*<br />\n.<br />\nStudent Advising<br />\nHall<br />\n*<br />\nGreat<br />\n.<br />\n4,<br />\n*<br />\n.<br />\n***<br />\n44<br />\nCo-Chairs<br />\n*<br />\n4,<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nare now due by<br />\n.<br />\n.<br />\n4,4,4, Free, but you must ***<br />\n4i)<br />\n(!)<br />\n* register by calling ** Lf.LAILLIe?c ULLikt1J<br />\n4,<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nthe<br />\n1,<br />\nin<br />\n*<br />\n4<br />\n*<br />\nOffice<br />\nthe<br />\nSAC<br />\n.<br />\n***<br />\n4<br />\nOffice<br />\n.<br />\n444<br />\n***<br />\nx8209<br />\n%............................................. 444444440444404444040444044C<br />\n4(<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n4(<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\nN.<br />\n<br />\nV'<br />\n<br />\nSt.PaulCleaners<br />\n<br />\nMuller sees need for more<br />\ncorporate support of research<br />\n<br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\n<br />\n235-4413<br />\n<br />\nMULLER, from 1<br />\nthe National Institutes of Health.<br />\nNoting that industry draws its<br />\nresearch personnel from the<br />\nuniversity environment, Muller<br />\nsaid that corporate donations of<br />\nstate-of-the-art scientific equipment to the University's<br />\nlaboratories would be welcome.<br />\n\"The explosion of science and<br />\ntechnology resulted in instrumentation which is quite miraculous<br />\nin what it can achieve, but whose<br />\ncost is increasingly unaffordable,\" he said.<br />\n\"It has alreay dawned upon a<br />\nnumber of corporations that they<br />\nhave to retrain people out of the<br />\nUniversity,\" he continued.<br />\n\"Soon, a real Ph.D. will be<br />\nmeaningless until you have been<br />\nin a corporation for a few years,<br />\nuntil you are set in your craft.\"<br />\nWhile the Applied Physics<br />\nLaboratory receives the lion's<br />\nshare of Hopkins' federal funding<br />\n($313 million out of a total of<br />\n$445 million of federal grants to<br />\nHopkins this year), Muller<br />\nremarked that Hopkins has no<br />\nfinancial interest in APL; the<br />\nlaboratory is run solely at the<br />\nbehest of the U.S. government,<br />\nhe said.<br />\nExcept for research at APL,<br />\noperations at other divisions do<br />\nnot depend on military contracts,<br />\n<br />\nBring in this coupon with your incoming order for a<br />\nI10%<br />\n<br />\n\u201411<br />\n<br />\ndiscount on all dry cleaning<br />\nexpires 3/ 10/88<br />\n<br />\n1tocii.fF<br />\nFl<br />\n<br />\nffltt,<br />\n<br />\n-c1X1PME#<br />\n<br />\nt6\u2014 Malit;0)-7<br />\n7- 7\u2018=\u2014/ko Mitf4a)<br />\n<br />\nVahtni Ai&L -c,<br />\n$3;p6iis kufgni,vothkx(1.<br />\n<br />\nU.S. A. 1-C'<br />\n<br />\nRECRUIT U.S.A., INC.

Reprinted with permission.<br />\nWASHINGTON<br />\n<br />\nDavid W. Breneman, president of Kalamazoo<br />\nCollege, thinks the nation's 100 most expensive and<br />\nselective private colleges are engaging in<br />\n\"lemming-like behavior\" when it comes to setting<br />\ntuition rates, and he admits that he is following the<br />\ncrowd himself. (Tuition at Kalamazoo is $8,998 this<br />\nyear; next year's has not been determined.)<br />\nAt a recent conference here on college costs sponsored by the National Center for Postsecondary<br />\nFinance and Governance, and in an interview afterward, Mr. Breneman explained his views. He said<br />\nthat although the public was growing increasingly<br />\nuneasy about rising tuitions, he and others at private<br />\ncolleges were observing a paradoxical phenomenon:<br />\nthe higher their prices, the larger their applicant<br />\npool.<br />\n\"All of us are beginning to realize that to some<br />\ndegree in this market, people judge quality by price,<br />\nand that a low price at a private college is not<br />\nnecessarily a sign of good management,\" he said.<br />\n\"I really do think there is a changing mindset in<br />\nhigher education now, and it's been spreading out<br />\nfrom the most elite and selective core to some of<br />\nus who are in the next echelon, where<br />\nincreasingly\u2014rightly or wrongly\u2014we are seeing<br />\nprice as a statement to the public of who we are,\"<br />\nhe continued.<br />\nMr. Breneman said he thought peer pressure was<br />\nresponsbile for one or two percentage points of the<br />\nannual tuition increases of selective private colleges.<br />\nHe hastened to add that, by and large, colleges<br />\nwere spending their tuition revenues wisely.<br />\n\"Nobody is making any profits in private higher<br />\neducation,\" he said. \"We'remot squirreling money<br />\naway, and we're not giving profits to stockholders.<br />\nWe raise it and we spend it in a neverending chase<br />\nto enhance the quality of our programs.\"<br />\nThis year, for example, Kalamazoo decided to<br />\nadd an East Asian studies program, a new cost that<br />\nwill be reflected in tuition.<br />\nMr. Breneman said his views on the subject had<br />\nbeen sharpened by an article by Barry Werth in the<br />\nJanuary issue of New England Monthly, \"Why Is<br />\n<br />\nCollege So Expensive?\" The subtitle gave the<br />\nanswer: \"One reason only, Mr. and Mrs. America:<br />\nYou want it that way.\" The article profiled the costly and successful strategy that Mount Holyoke College had followed to improve its quality and keep<br />\nenrollments high.<br />\nMr. Breneman said he could not afford not to<br />\nkeep up with the competition. He would not serve<br />\nKalamazoo well, he said, if he raised tuition 6 percent while peer institutions raised it 7 or 8 percent.<br />\nThe other colleges would have more money to spend<br />\nto improve their programs, and Kalamazoo would<br />\nfall behind. After a few years of slower-thanaverage increases, his college would lose its competitive position \"both in perception and in reality.\"<br />\n'Prisoners of Others'<br />\nKeeping up with the pack exacts a steep price,<br />\naccording to Mr. Breneman. \"It makes us prisoners<br />\nof others,\" he said, and can lead colleges to make<br />\n\"excessive and distasteful\" quality improvements.<br />\nIn addition, he said, it breaks an implicit contract<br />\nwith parents that costs will not go up unreasonably<br />\nwhile their children are enrolled. \"If there are three<br />\nyears of 9-per-cent increases, by the fourth year,<br />\nparents are buying a very different product,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe believes that private colleges are in danger of<br />\nlosing their integrity by telling parents that tuitions<br />\nare rising solely because of factors such as the rising costs of faculty salaries, laboratory equipment,<br />\nand computers. \"There's a competitive dimension<br />\nto our increases,\" he said, \"and some of that spending is discretionary.\"<br />\nMr. Breneman thinks that no one college can<br />\nbreak the back of this internally generated tuition<br />\ninflation. With collective action, however, he thinks<br />\nthe cost run-up could be ended. \"If we would all<br />\ngo up two points less, we'd all live, we'd all be just<br />\nfine,\" he said.<br />\nHe believes that publicizing the issue would help,<br />\ntoo. Once the strategy is exposed, he said, college<br />\npresidents might find it more difficult to tell parents<br />\nless than the full truth.<br />\n\u2014JEAN EVANGELAUF<br />\n<br />\n51-<br />\n<br />\nHarvard<br />\nthis<br />\nsummer<br />\nJune 27\u2014August 19, 1988<br />\n<br />\n1743.<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\narvard Summer<br />\nSchool offers open-enrollment in day and evening<br />\ncourses.

The Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library will use the<br />\nbasement as storage space.<br />\n\"Originally, the Shaffer addition was to provide swing space<br />\nfrom displacements in Gilman<br />\nHall,\" said Schuerholz. \"Now<br />\nwe're reviewing many projects<br />\nand are not sure if those plans will<br />\nremain pat.\"<br />\nScheduled at first to coincide<br />\nwith the completion of the Shaffer addition, the renovation of<br />\nGilman Hall may not begin this<br />\nspring.<br />\n\"We're not sure when the<br />\nwork will begin,\" said<br />\nSchuerholz, \"but we have the<br />\ndesign plans essentially complete<br />\nfor the renovation of Gilman<br />\nHall.\"<br />\nRenovations to the building,<br />\naccording to Schuerholz, will include installing new heating and<br />\ncooling systems, upgrading the<br />\npresent electrical system, bringing the building up to current fire<br />\nand safety standards, and doing<br />\ngeneral refurbishment and<br />\npainting.<br />\n\"At 140,000 square feet,<br />\nGilman Hall is the largest<br />\n<br />\nbuilding on campus except for the<br />\nMSE Library,\" said Schuerholz.<br />\n\"Renovation will entail a lot of<br />\nwork just because of the<br />\nbuilding's sheer size.\"<br />\nSchuerholz estimated that<br />\nrenovation, once begun, would \u2022<br />\ntake approximately twenty<br />\nmonths to complete and would<br />\ncost $10 million.<br />\nReferring to Gilman Hall's<br />\nstatus as a designated historic<br />\nlandmark, Schuerholz asserted,<br />\n\"We're going to do everything<br />\npossible to maintain the<br />\nbuilding's beautiful ambiance and<br />\ncharacter. In addition, whatever<br />\nwe plan to do to the outside of the<br />\nstructure will have to be approved by CHAP, the Committee for<br />\nHistorical and Architectural<br />\nPreservation.\"<br />\nPhase I of renovation to Ames<br />\nHall is now complete. Begun in<br />\nthe fall of 1986, Phase I included<br />\nrenovation of the ground floor<br />\nand first floor as well as the installation of new lighting and fire<br />\nprotection systems. Phase II, involving renovation of the second,<br />\nthird, and fourth floors of the<br />\nstructure, is presently underway,<br />\nand is scheduled to be complete<br />\nby September, 1988.<br />\nAs far as total cost is concerned, \"we'll be very close to the<br />\n$9.5 million projected cost,\" said<br />\nSchuerholz.<br />\nWhile the Department of<br />\nPsychology faculty members<br />\ndisplaced by Phase I have returned to their offices, occupants of<br />\nthe second, third, and fourth<br />\nfloors of the building have been<br />\nforced into temporary quarters in<br />\n<br />\nMergenthaler Hall and at the<br />\nRotunda.<br />\n\"Renovation in Ames was<br />\ndone in phases to accommodate<br />\nfaculty members using the facility,\" explained Schuerholz.<br />\n\"Whenever you renovate a structure with occupants in the<br />\nbuilding it's always difficult for<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nEventually, Ames will be occupied by the Department of<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering, Psychology, and<br />\nthree faculty members of the<br />\nDepartment of History.<br />\nInitiated with a groundbreaking<br />\nceremony on October 5, 1987,<br />\nconstruction continues on the<br />\nPhysics and Astronomy building,<br />\nlocated in the wooded knoll<br />\nacross from the Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute on San Martin<br />\nDrive.<br />\nTermed by the November 1987<br />\nedition of the Facilities Managemert Construction Update as<br />\n\"the largest and most expensive<br />\nproject ever undertaken at the<br />\nHomewood campus,\" the<br />\n230,000 square foot structure is<br />\nscheduled for completion in<br />\nJanuary, 1990.<br />\nThe $35 million building will<br />\nconsist of separate research and<br />\nteaching wings joined by what<br />\nSchuerholz termed \"a beautiful<br />\nand functional lobby-reception<br />\narea.\" The lobby will be open<br />\nthrough three stories of the<br />\nbuilding and will be surrounded<br />\nby common areas such as a lecture hall, a reading room, and the<br />\n<br />\n% t<br />\n<br />\n4,111\u2018<br />\n<br />\n1.7<br />\n<br />\n.410,<br />\nJ<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\nArlett-s<br />\n<br />\nRichard A.

Lee Davis<br />\n<br />\nChoosing Perspective<br />\nStudents will be going to the polls on<br />\nTuesday to select next year's Student Council executives and to narrow the field of<br />\ncandidates for the position of Young<br />\nTrustee.<br />\nFour candidates are battling for Student<br />\nCouncil President: Paul Diamond, Junior<br />\nClass Vice President Michael Fenzel,<br />\nSophomore Class President Lou<br />\nGiangiulio, and Junior Class Secretary<br />\nQuentin Snider.<br />\nAll of the candidates stress, at least<br />\namong their top priorities, that the responsibility of Council is to provide more social<br />\nprogramming for students.<br />\nThis tenet is not one which The NewsLetter wholeheartedly supports. Recent<br />\nyears have shown two developments: creation of the HOP, and growing student interest in and sensitivity to the \"important\"<br />\nissues.<br />\nThe purpose of the HOP is to oversee and<br />\nsponsor social programming. By design,<br />\nthe HOP more effectively and efficiently<br />\nundertakes programming, freeing up Council members to face the various concerns<br />\nof the student body.<br />\n\"Important\" issues are, of course hard<br />\nto determine, because importance is<br />\nrelative. Nevertheless, issues over the recent years, such as South African divestment, honor code, and even more recently<br />\nreplacing Dean Welch, have sparked student concern.<br />\nHopkins students are reaching a maturity level which enables them to perceive the<br />\nmany problems on our campus in a more<br />\ncohesive manner. Our community is beginning to see that there are similarities bet-<br />\n<br />\nween academic \"throatism\" and sexual intolerance and insufficient on-campus housing. The issue these and other problems boil<br />\ndown to, one that is effectively brought out<br />\nby the Human Climate Task Force report,<br />\nis that much of what Hopkins is today<br />\nfosters a lack of campus community,and accordingly a disrespect and intolerance for<br />\nothers.<br />\nThere is much that needs to be done\u2014<br />\nphysically to the campus and to the Hopkins<br />\npsyche\u2014to address this problem. It is<br />\ndisturbing that the candidates still place so<br />\nmuch emphasis on Council's social programming functions, given the HOP's success this year and that the Task Force report<br />\noutlined a number of \"important\" issues.<br />\nIt is even more disturbing that some of the<br />\ncandidates suggest that a study break or a<br />\nparty will solve our problems.<br />\nOnly Lou Giangiulio displays, perhaps<br />\nbecause of his experience, perspective on<br />\nthe larger issues. Lou has distinguished<br />\nhimself during his two years on Council as<br />\npresident of the freshman and sophomore<br />\nclasses. He, too, lays emphasis on Council's role as a social programmer.<br />\nHowever, his words on these pages reflect<br />\nthat he views social events as a means<br />\ntoward rallying students and motivating<br />\nthem to then engage other issues. He has<br />\na solid notion of integrating all facets of the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nCouncil needs someone to look with<br />\nbroad perspective at the problems facing the<br />\nHopkins community, and address the \"important\" issues which can effect improvement. We think that Lou is the best man<br />\nfor this job.<br />\n<br />\nThe Dynasty Continues<br />\nYou just know it's that time of year<br />\nagain. Young Trustee and Student Council candidates become especially visible.<br />\nSpring Break is just around the corner and<br />\n\"lacrosse\" is the word around campus.<br />\nIf there's anything that typifies Hopkins<br />\nmore than pre-meds, it's lacrosse. It's the<br />\nage-old tradition which drives even the<br />\nzeekiest out of the library on Saturday afternoons to support the team.<br />\nThe Hopkins lacrosse fan is a faithful<br />\none\u2014and an educated one. The Hopkins<br />\nfan knows to cheer, not just when the team<br />\nscores, but when they make an excellent<br />\nplay or a save as well. The Hopkins fan appreciates a challenge more than they do a<br />\nwin; last season's semi-final win against<br />\nfirst-ranked Maryland meant more to him<br />\nthan the championship game against Cornell. Of course winning the title back made<br />\n<br />\nthings that much sweeter.<br />\nIt all may be due to the fact that lacrosse<br />\nis Hopkins' only Division I sport, the one<br />\nteam for which we consistently receive nationwide recognition.

This issue<br />\nis so important it deserves<br />\nelaboration, and so I shall<br />\nelaborate on a number of points,<br />\nat the risk of appearing redundant. More than the political<br />\nphilosophy of voting in a<br />\ndemocracy, however, I would<br />\nlike to specifically address the<br />\ntechnical difficulties one encounters as one prepares to vote<br />\nin this country.<br />\nThe purpose of Culp's article<br />\nas well as this diatribe is to get<br />\nall of you to vote. I believe that<br />\nmost people on this campus are<br />\nbright enough to want to vote,<br />\nand that the main thing holding<br />\nthem back is the lack of<br />\nknowledge about the bureaucratic<br />\nobstacle course standing in their<br />\nway. The Young Democrats<br />\nrecently put out a flyer on how to<br />\nbecome enfranchised, but I personally felt that, although it was<br />\n<br />\nan honorable gesture, it was not<br />\nenough.<br />\nThe flyer detailed what one<br />\nneeds to do to vote: register with<br />\nyour state (or county in massive<br />\nstates like NY), apply for an<br />\nabsentee ballot if you are out of<br />\nstate, or go to the polls. All of this<br />\nrequires a certain amount of<br />\nlegwork, which, understandably,<br />\nnot everyone is willing to do. In<br />\nthe cause of efficiency, I have<br />\ncontacted the Election Boards of<br />\nNY, NJ, and PA and found out<br />\nhow to help people vote, and the<br />\nresponse has been quite<br />\nfavorable. In my room at this moment there sit: Absentee Ballot<br />\nApplications from New York<br />\nState and Pennsylvania, as well as<br />\nregistration forms from Pennsylvania. I should be receiving<br />\nNew Jersey forms presently. For<br />\nyour general information, it's too<br />\nlate to register for the primary in<br />\nNew York and all Super Tuesday<br />\nstates (that includes Maryland,<br />\nthe rest of the South, and a few<br />\n<br />\nother states), but already<br />\nregistered voters can still get<br />\nabsentee ballots.<br />\nSO CALL ME!!! I can get the<br />\nnecessary forms to you in a jiffy,<br />\nand if I don't have them, I will<br />\nbe more than happy to order them<br />\nfor you. My number is 338-7258,<br />\nor you can drop by my room in<br />\nthe dorms (Wood, 122:<br />\nHousemaster Room).

Rest assured that<br />\neveryone still has ample time to<br />\nregister for the November general<br />\nelection.

In<br />\nfact, the night after I wrote the<br />\ncolumn panning the cafeteria I<br />\nwent down to dinner just after<br />\nseven, and was thoroughly<br />\ndisgusted that I would either have<br />\nto stand in the only line open to<br />\n<br />\nget food that I won't eat, pick<br />\nthrough a devastated salad bar, or<br />\ntake my repast elsewhere.<br />\nSo for the first time in my nearly six months at Hopkins, I went<br />\nto complain, and was directed to<br />\nDirector of Dining Services Mary<br />\nColatori, known affectionately to<br />\nmost as just Mary, who asked<br />\nwhat I thought was wrong. She<br />\npointed out a few things that in<br />\npast nights would have satisfied<br />\nme, but did not disagree that I had<br />\nno basis to be dissatisfied on that<br />\nnight. She did not become defensive, much to her credit.<br />\nThen we talked for a good fifteen minutes about what I thought<br />\nwould improve the service. As I<br />\nmust confess that I'm not sure<br />\nwhat I really want other than a<br />\nkitchen of my own open 24 hours<br />\ndaily, I was somewhat on the<br />\nspot. But I did come up with a<br />\n<br />\nfew suggestions, with a little<br />\nsteering provided by Mary.

In this issue, the NewsLetter is running an election profile based on personal interviews,<br />\nwhich is good. But wouldn't it be<br />\neven better to hear what the candidates have to say for themselves<br />\nin an open forum and to address<br />\nyour own personal complaints or<br />\nsuggestions face-to-face?<br />\nThere was, in fact, such a<br />\nforum on Monday night,<br />\nFebruary 29, in the AMR I multipurpose room, and, of the handful on hand to hear the platforms<br />\nof those running for office, I can<br />\ntell you for a fact that even fewer<br />\nwere there of their own free will.<br />\nI was not surprised by the turnout, since this has been the typical<br />\nresponse for such forums in the<br />\npast. Also, many people are<br />\neither too busy or think they have<br />\ntheir minds made up to vote for<br />\nsomeone they may know personally. But of these two reasons,<br />\nI would prefer the former to the<br />\nlatter.<br />\nI am not going to preach on the<br />\ndisgruntled view that most<br />\nHopkins elections are popularity<br />\ncontests. The elections process<br />\nhas been good to me in the past,<br />\nand I believe that if a person is<br />\ninvolved and active enough to be<br />\nwell-known and well-liked, they<br />\nprobably have the qualities to be<br />\na good student leader. But for the<br />\nstudent who has recently decided<br />\nto take on more responsibility and<br />\nis trying to more actively participate in the school, the lack of<br />\nattendance at a forum such as the<br />\none last Monday night gives it the<br />\nappearance of a mere triviality,<br />\nand works against what the idea<br />\nof student government should be.<br />\nI won't deceive you; I am one<br />\nof the candidates running for office. But I am also a student,just<br />\nlike yourselves, and whether I<br />\nwin or lose, I would like to feel<br />\nthat it was because the majority<br />\nof the student body voted in a<br />\nresponsible manner. It is the<br />\nlarger responsibility of those running to make themselves visible<br />\nto the students and to do what<br />\nthey can to get their views made<br />\npublic so that you can make this<br />\ndecision.

The problem isn't<br />\nthat the committees don't report<br />\noften enough, rather that they<br />\ngive us little to work with. Six<br />\nmonths ago, the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force concluded that<br />\nracism, sexism, and general intolerance are prevalent at<br />\nHomewood. Yet the only time we<br />\neven discussed issues of concern<br />\nhave been the few times we've<br />\nbeen forced by the Administration, suct, as the reform of the<br />\nAdd/Drop system and Orientation<br />\nchairperson selection. The gnawing fear of most of the council<br />\nseems to be that the Coalition<br />\n(ugh) might start complaining<br />\nagain. Few council members<br />\nhave any drive to justify their<br />\nposition and come to Council<br />\nwith issues. Every week we are<br />\nbombarded with demands from<br />\nour President to spend money,<br />\nostensibly for social programming. Surely, there must be other<br />\nuses for our $15,000 than only<br />\nsocial events, which already have<br />\nan allocated budget through the<br />\nHOP.<br />\nCouncil this year became one<br />\nbig cruise line, designed only to<br />\nkeep you happy with another beer<br />\nuntil your next exam. While certain improvements to the condition of life have been made, we<br />\nare letting down the students by<br />\nnot addressing core issues such as<br />\nthose detailed by the H.C.T.F. In<br />\ncase you don't believe this, please<br />\ncome to any council meeting<br />\nWednesday at 8 in the Shriver<br />\nBoard Room. We could use a little prodding.<br />\nGeorge Lerner<br />\n<br />\nYT: Summing Up<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI learned, to some amusement<br />\non Monday night, that due to the<br />\nlarge number of candidates for<br />\nYoung Trustee this year, each of<br />\nus would have the privilege of<br />\nsumming up our candidacies in<br />\ntwo (count 'em) sentences. With<br />\na finite News-Letter budget, a<br />\nlacrosse insert, and upcoming<br />\nStudent Council elections, it is<br />\nunderstandable that space is<br />\nlimited. What concerns me is the<br />\nmanner in which this space is being used.<br />\nIn the limited space allotted to<br />\neach candidate is included their<br />\npicture, birth date, hometown,<br />\nactivities at JHU, and the amazing two sentences. Are these the<br />\nmost pertinent pieces of information the electorate should be<br />\naware of when voting for this<br />\nposition? I hardly think so.<br />\nWhy the picture? This is an<br />\nelection for a position on the<br />\n&<br />\n<br />\n.4 \u2022\u20224<br />\n<br />\nS<br />\n<br />\nBoard of Trustees, not a beauty<br />\ncontest (a fact for which I am<br />\ngrateful). Why the birth date? Is<br />\nan Aquarius better suited for the<br />\nBoard than a Capricorn? And<br />\nregional biases notwithstanding,<br />\nof what worth is hometown? Activities are a bit more nettlesome.<br />\nThere is much temptation to<br />\nbelieve that there are actually<br />\nundergraduate activities which<br />\ncan prepare one for becoming a<br />\nTrustee of this University. To<br />\nunderstand that this is not the case<br />\nrequires an understanding of what<br />\nthe Young Trusteeship is all<br />\nabout.<br />\nWhat, then, is Trusteeship<br />\nabout? The answer would not only include the official duties of the<br />\nTrustees, which are found in the<br />\nJust One Spot brochure and<br />\nshould be in the News-Letter, but<br />\nalso the unofficial roles. By this<br />\nI mean that the position is what<br />\nthe holder can make of it. Just<br />\nwhat each candidate plans to<br />\nmake of it, then, is the pertinent<br />\ninformation, unfortunately<br />\nlimited to two sentences by the<br />\nNews-Letter staff. Such a pity.<br />\nThus a sad situation exists, and<br />\n<br />\nI will not make it worse by trying to use this space to further my<br />\nown candidacy as I was tempted<br />\nto. Rather, I will urge all the<br />\nreaders of this letter to please read<br />\ncarefully the full statements<br />\nwhich will be appearing in your<br />\nmailbox shortly, and please<br />\nfollow up with the candidates and<br />\nquestion them hard about their intentions. The Young Trustee-ship<br />\nis not the most visible of positions, but it has a wealth of unexplored potential. Let's not waste<br />\nit.<br />\nAmitava Biswas<br />\n<br />\nRecognizing Swimming<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAfter looking through the<br />\nsports section of the News-Letter<br />\nof 2/26, I was disappointed in not<br />\nfinding any mention of the swim<br />\nteam's conference championships.

The late<br />\nevening is the best time.<br />\nAnd now, a bit of philosophizing (you can stop here if you want<br />\nto). I want everyone to vote in the<br />\nprimary! Why? Well, as most of<br />\nyou have noticed, the political<br />\nclimate of the United States is<br />\ndominated by two major parties,<br />\nmaking other parties almost inconsequential. This situation has<br />\noften led individuals, usually in<br />\npseudo-intellectual coffee-table<br />\nconversation, to complain of the<br />\nrelative lack of choice we the<br />\ncitizens actually have in choosing<br />\nour leader. But. is this the case?<br />\nThe qualified answer is yes, we<br />\ndo not really have much of a<br />\nchoice come November. True,<br />\nthere are the Free Libertarians<br />\nand American Communists, and<br />\nthe ever-popular Socialist<br />\nWorkers, et al, but who really<br />\ngives them any chance? This<br />\nview, however, is only valid if<br />\nyou believe that the only vote that<br />\nmatters is a vote for a winner.<br />\nThat is decidedly not how<br />\ndemocracy should operate. A<br />\nvote should be a matter of conscience, not a matter of siding with<br />\na Goliath. It is easy to see how<br />\nthe latter attitude can lead to a<br />\nself-fulfilling prophecy, Biblical<br />\nallusions notwithstanding.<br />\nMore to the point is that we<br />\nAmericans have a considerable<br />\namount of leverage in deciding<br />\nwho will be on those top two<br />\ntickets in the first place. This is<br />\nthrough that spectacularly lengthy<br />\nhorse race going on as you read:<br />\nthe Presidential primaries. Here<br />\nwe have a choice of ten folks to<br />\ngive our trust to, representing as<br />\nwide a spectrum of mainstream<br />\nAmerican politics as we are likely to get. Does that sound like a<br />\nbackhanded compliment? Well, it<br />\nshould.<br />\nHere begins my answer for all<br />\nthe low voter turnout stories you<br />\nhave ever heard, and here the<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 \u2022 4 \u202224z.111,-,:rel-...4<br />\n.<br />\nf....5.14..2ger!if\"?<br />\n<br />\nissue relates to campus voting as<br />\nwell. The two general reasons<br />\ngiven for low voter turnout is that<br />\neither the voters are lazy and<br />\napathetic, or there are not any<br />\ncandidates worth voting for.<br />\nNow, as long as we cannot gauge<br />\nwhat is going on in the minds of<br />\nnon-voters, we can never know<br />\nthe answer to this question. But<br />\nI would urge everyone who feels<br />\nthat there are no candidates worthy of their vote to go to the polls<br />\nanyway and express this, by actively abstaining.<br />\nWhat good is this? Is this<br />\n\"throwing away your vote\"?<br />\nCertainly not. A passive abstention, sitting at home, may show<br />\neither dissatisfaction or apathy.<br />\nAn active abstention decidedly<br />\nshows dissatisfaction. If you're<br />\nfed up and not going to take it<br />\nanymore, and no one knows<br />\nabout it, that's no good. An official abstention shows your anger<br />\nand irritation: use it! Remember<br />\nthat a vote for a candidate reflects<br />\nyour trust in that candidate, tells<br />\nthe world that you sincerely<br />\nbelieve that he/she is a capable<br />\nperson for the job, not simply that<br />\neveryone else is worse. Abstaining is a very constructive way of<br />\nexpressing the sentiment that<br />\neveryone running is a loser (if<br />\nyou really think so, of course).<br />\nIt really is not as ridiculous as<br />\nit might sound. One need only<br />\nlook at the delegate totals of the<br />\ncurrent Democratic contenders to<br />\nsee the value of abstention.<br />\nSimon, Dukakis, and Gephardt<br />\nall have relatively the same<br />\nnumber of committed delegates,<br />\nabout 40-50 each; while there are<br />\nover 250 uncommitted delegates.<br />\nThe result: none of these guys<br />\nseems easily assured of the<br />\nnomination, and the Democratic<br />\nParty is doing some serious soulsearching.

Representatives from<br />\norganizations at Hopkins and<br />\nother local collges and universities will be addressing the many<br />\nimportant issues brought out by<br />\nJackson's campaign.<br />\nWhether or not you are supporting Jackson's campaign, I hope<br />\nyou will attend to be part of the<br />\npolitical process and hear where<br />\nhe stands on the issues. For many<br />\nof you who have preconceived<br />\nnotions about Jackson's positions,<br />\nI would hope you will keep an<br />\nopen mind and come and hear<br />\nwhat his many supporters have to<br />\nsay.<br />\nBob Baer<br />\n<br />\nSAC Seal Information<br />\n<br />\nDancing for SAMS<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\n<br />\nSAC Seals are awarded every<br />\nyear to graduating seniors who<br />\nhave made outstanding contributions to extracurricular life at<br />\nHopkins. In the past, those who<br />\nhave received awards have had<br />\ntheir names announced at commencement. This year, Chris<br />\nColombo's office is throwing a<br />\ndinner. Any undergraduate may<br />\nnominate whomever he chooses,<br />\nproviding that the nominee is a<br />\nsenior. NOMINATION FORMS<br />\nARE NOW AVAILABLE IN<br />\nTHE SAC OFFICE. I urge you<br />\nall to nominate as many people as<br />\nyou feel are deserving. In the<br />\npast, some very talented people<br />\nhave been denied awards because<br />\nthe general populace assumed that<br />\nthe rest of the general populace<br />\nhad already made the necessary<br />\nnominations. Never assume.<br />\nNomination forms are due in,<br />\nagain at the SAC office, by 5<br />\np.m. on Friday, March 18. As<br />\nsoon as we come back from<br />\nSpring Break, a list of all those<br />\nnominated will be posted in the<br />\nSAC office. If the Seals Committee needs any more information<br />\non any of the nominees, or if<br />\nthere was someone noticeably absent from the list, the Committee<br />\nwill ask for further information<br />\nand nominations.<br />\n<br />\nThe Union Board and the InterFraternity Council will be sponsoring a Marathon Dance March<br />\n11\u2014March 12 to benefit Students<br />\nAgainst Multiple Sclerosis<br />\n(SAMS).

If so, what kind?<br />\nWell, we've already started up this year<br />\nthe Ad Hoc Committee for the Honor<br />\nCode, so when this committee comes forth<br />\nwith its proposal, which should be in a<br />\nweek or so, we're going to review that with<br />\nCouncil. If they come up with a proposal<br />\nwhich sounds feasible, I'll definitely push<br />\nfor it. An honor code's a good thing, but<br />\nit's not going to happen overnight.<br />\nIt works at other schools, but we haven't<br />\nhad it at Hopkins for a while. It's going<br />\nto take time to instill the idea of an honor<br />\ncode in the minds of the students. If we start<br />\nwith next year's freshman class, and they<br />\nhave no idea what to expect here, and if<br />\nwe start instilling that idea into them, then<br />\nfrom then on, the pieces can fall together.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report?<br />\nThe more activities you have to get a majority of the students together, that's going<br />\nto help relations among different types of<br />\nstudents, different people\u2014men, women,<br />\ndifferent races, and so forth. While you're<br />\nhere for four years, you're going to have<br />\ncontact with these people and you're going to have to get to know these people.<br />\nI'm going to try to have more of these<br />\nactivities such as Hoppy Hour and so forth<br />\nso you can see these people in a social atmosphere [other than class) and maybe<br />\nreduce some of the bias that some people<br />\nmay have had coming from different areas<br />\nof the country, different schools, and try<br />\nto build the character of a Hopkins student.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nIt's hard to pick out one certain issue.<br />\nMaybe sometimes Council could lean a little more toward the social programming<br />\nand not be all around academic and different aspects of the University. If you start<br />\nwith social programming and get more<br />\npeople involved, then you can start with<br />\nthat and work up to bigger and better<br />\nthings, such as foster better attitudes<br />\namong the students.<br />\n<br />\nyour top priority?<br />\nI have several top priorities. The two<br />\nmain ones are student service and social<br />\nprogramming. I think these are both very<br />\nimportant in order to make Hopkins a better community for the undergraduates<br />\nhere.<br />\nI also think that it's very important<br />\nto increase interaction between students<br />\nand the faculty or administration. I<br />\nthink that we should expand the studentfaculty interaction programs. It's important because I know there are always a<br />\nlot of people left out who want to do<br />\nit<br />\nN-L: What is the Council's purpose?<br />\nI see the Council's purpose on this campus as basically social programming and<br />\nstudent service. I think that we are not a<br />\nvery political council and I think, in ways<br />\nthat is good.<br />\nI do think that tolerance is important and<br />\nI feel that when people have political<br />\ngrievances they should be able to freely<br />\nvoice them. But the Council is basically to<br />\nserve students, and do the things they want<br />\nto do.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for a honor<br />\ncode? If so, what kind?<br />\nMy gut reaction to this is that I don't<br />\nthink that an honor code would work at<br />\nHopkins. I think that it's something that<br />\nshould be looked into. I think that the<br />\nstudents here are good and its not a slur<br />\non them or that I don't trust them, it's just<br />\na very, very competitive environment and<br />\nit would be very difficult to put an honor<br />\ncode into effect.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report?<br />\nIn terms of issues like a student union,<br />\nI think that is very important. It would<br />\nbe wonderful to have a place where<br />\nstudents could get together. especially<br />\nthe upperclassmen who live off campus,<br />\nto socialize with each other and do<br />\nactivities.<br />\nI think that the committee itself was a<br />\ngreat idea, and that it really served the<br />\ncommunity by looking into a lot of very<br />\nimportant issues for student welfare. The<br />\nrole of an ombudsmen is one that should<br />\nbe looked into, and would be very important and would serve student needs.<br />\nBut I also think that part of the role<br />\nof Council is for students to go to Council with these problems. and it is there<br />\nas a liaison between students and administrative and faculty problems. So I think<br />\nit would be important to delineate what<br />\nexactly the role of an ombudsman would<br />\nbe. That needs to be more specified.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nOverall I think that the Council has done<br />\na very good job this year with student services and sot ial programming.<br />\nOne thing that I think is important is<br />\naccessibility on the Council to student<br />\nneeds. Something that I would be interested in doing is possibly posting or<br />\npublishing the Council agenda before the<br />\nmeetings so that students would know what<br />\nwe are goinl, to be discussing before it<br />\ncomes out.<br />\nAs it is now I think that students don't<br />\neven have any idea what's going on until<br />\nthey read it after the fact in the News-Letter<br />\non Friday. One way to do this would be<br />\nto perhaps to maybe change the meetings<br />\nto Monday nights, and publish the agenda<br />\nFriday. or post it somewhere.<br />\nSo I think that accessibility is very important and that is something that needs to<br />\nbe looked into. We need to get more<br />\nstudents involved in the Council.<br />\n<br />\nPaul<br />\n<br />\nMichael<br />\n<br />\nDIAMOND<br />\nDIAMOND, from 16<br />\nly cannot say is one thing. [It would<br />\nbe to] take care of both the academic<br />\nquestions which the Student Council will<br />\nhandle and both the social questions.<br />\nAs president of the Student Council. I'm<br />\ngoing to have to work hard so that the<br />\nstudents aren't going to have to work hard<br />\nfor these things.<br />\nN-L: What is the Council's purpose?<br />\nGenerally the Council's purpose is<br />\nto work hard to take care of the problems of the students so that they, the<br />\nstudents, [who] don't have time to take<br />\ncare of these problems themselves,<br />\nso that they can go on with their lives.<br />\nOf course, we are going to welcome<br />\ninput from the students at all times.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for an honor<br />\ncode? if so, what kind?<br />\nI don't think that a specific honor code is the answer to the problem<br />\nof academic ethics in this school. However, I do think that a large responsibility for upholding academic ethics<br />\nlies in the professors' hands in the<br />\nclasses.<br />\nI know that I have seen in different<br />\nclasses, mainly during tests and exams,<br />\nthe proctoring is very lax. Of course,<br />\nthe students must participate also, we<br />\nmust encourage that. But I don't know<br />\nif the answer to that is a specific honor<br />\ncode.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report?<br />\nWell, I'm all for things like expanding<br />\nthe student union, things like that. Because<br />\nI know that our student union at this school<br />\nreally isn't the kind of place where people<br />\nwill congregate, to hang out and be with<br />\ntheir friends.<br />\nAlso, one of the great problems is that<br />\npeople, regardless whether they are living<br />\nclose to the campus, kind of view it<br />\nas a commuter school, they come to<br />\nthe school, they go to their classes, then<br />\nthey go home. Then, if they are doing any<br />\nother activities, it'll be off campus. There<br />\nis no sense of we are going to come to campus to have a good time,just to go to class.<br />\nN-L: So you would work to improve<br />\nthe student union?<br />\nSpecifically yes, and other things as<br />\nwell.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nI think there are certain issues such as<br />\ntuition hikes and divestment which really<br />\nneed to be covered a lot more.<br />\nN-L: How might you cover these<br />\nisues?<br />\nWell, on the most simple level, the<br />\nStudent Council will decide upon and<br />\nmake suggestions based on what they<br />\nfeel will be best for the students, and<br />\nwhat the students tell the Student Council what would be best for them.<br />\nI think that although the Student Council this year has addressed the issue<br />\nof creating a sense of participation among<br />\nthe students with the campus on campus, there is still a lot left to be done<br />\nand this is a major concern that we, I<br />\nwould have to deal with as Student Council president.<br />\n<br />\ndeveloped the idea of P.T. Flaggs' nights.<br />\nThat and my attitude would separate me<br />\nfrom the candidates, because I'm eager to<br />\nget started and revamp social<br />\nprogramming\u2014to get us more involved<br />\nand to stay involved.<br />\nN-L: As President, what would be<br />\nyour top priority?<br />\nI would have to say the interests of the<br />\nstudent body. They're going to vary for the<br />\nsocial interests. I'm going to have things<br />\nplanned for them every single weekend,<br />\nwithout exception. People won't be surprised to hear something's going on.<br />\nThere'll be another section of the student<br />\nbody that's interested in political issues,<br />\nand I have that background to inform the<br />\nstudent body on what's going on with the<br />\nstock portfolio. Then, we could talk about<br />\nthe chartering of the athletic clubs as well.<br />\nGetting in touch with the student body<br />\nis my top priority.<br />\nN-L: What is Council's purpose?<br />\nThe purpose of the Student Council is<br />\nto serve the student body and their interests, and that is my full intention\u2014to<br />\nserve the student body and to make sure<br />\ntheir views are heard and to represent their<br />\nideas and their attitudes.<br />\nAn example would be the tuition increases. The Student Council has been<br />\npushing a financial committee, and I'd like<br />\nto push that through and maintain it. One<br />\n,other thing is the add-drop dates. This<br />\nyear, I fought very hard for the students'<br />\ninterests because I knew they didn't want<br />\nto shorten the add-drop dates.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for an honor<br />\ncode? If so, what kind?<br />\nI would push for an honor code, but it<br />\nwouldn't be one to the extent of West<br />\nPoint. where the pressure is so great that<br />\nit detracts from the atmosphere.<br />\nIt would be more of a situation where<br />\nif it's apparent that there is a problem, then<br />\nmy advice for the students would be to actually take it to the professor and make him<br />\naware of it. If that doesn't work, it would<br />\nhave to be in steps.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force report?<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force dealt<br />\nwith a variety of issues, (like) the social<br />\natmosphere at Hopkins. I would make<br />\nclear to the Task Force\u2014it's an ongoing<br />\nprocess\u2014and to the student body that there<br />\nwould be a social programming overhaul.<br />\nThe quality of life here at Hopkins will<br />\nimprove as the attitudes of the students improve. If the attitides of the students are<br />\nnegative, then the quality of life is going<br />\nto point toward the negative side.<br />\nEveryone knows the difficulties involved: the study time, the hours of studying<br />\nyou have to put in, the stress that accompanies those hours.<br />\n(We need to) give the students a break.<br />\nIf they have a break, I think that quality<br />\nof life will follow: that as well as knowing that the school is involved with the<br />\ncommunity, is involved in looking out for<br />\ntheir interests, the Student Council's looking out for their interests.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nProbably the support and chartering of<br />\nathletic clubs and other school attachments<br />\nlike literary publications. I would push for<br />\nevery organization that wants to get involved in the school. There are clubs such as<br />\nthe hockey club that have been given support, but I'm not sure it's adequate<br />\nsupport.<br />\nI think that the Student Council has<br />\ntouched on many issues, and they've done<br />\na good job, but I would like to be a little<br />\nmore intense on all levels\u2014maybe probe<br />\nin a little more, and make it more of an<br />\nopen table discussion during the meetings<br />\nland] address the issues better.<br />\n<br />\nQuentin<br />\n<br />\n\f18/MARCH 4, 1988<br />\n.//<br />\n<br />\n0/<br />\n41<br />\n,11<br />\n'L/1<br />\n0i 10Or rf<br />\nif r;////i\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n...I,,,<br />\n,.<br />\n0- ' 1<br />\n<br />\n/,<br />\na<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\n,g<br />\n0- iiiolt<br />\nor<br />\n/ I<br />\n/<br />\n(/<br />\nI<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n1011.177<br />\n///// if/1<br />\n<br />\notf<br />\nYOUNG<br />\nTRUSTEE<br />\n1988<br />\nCandidates for Young Trustee<br />\nprovided statements of their candidacies to the Office of the Board<br />\nof Trustees.

In many cases the alumni can also set up interviews for<br />\ntheir \"mentees\".

He<br />\nfeels that the program is well<br />\norganized and efficient. He also<br />\nbelieves that the program is successful because \"the mentors are<br />\nall volunteers and just as excited<br />\nas the students are.\"<br />\nThe mentoring process begins<br />\nwhen the student contacts Bernstein. She puts the name of the student and his or her career interests into her computer and tries<br />\nto match the student with a mentor/alumnus. After she finds a<br />\npositive match, she contacts the<br />\nalumni and informs them that<br />\nthey will be hearing from their<br />\n\"mentee\" in a few days.

The response from<br />\nthe alumni was very positive. One<br />\nhundred and fifty alumni<br />\nresponded, and there are over sixty fields of interest now listed in<br />\nthe file.

Born in 1898 in<br />\nEngland, the son of a miner,<br />\nMoore studied academic draftsmanship at the Royal College of<br />\nArt in London. He began<br />\nsculpting in the 1930's and<br />\nbecame a respected father-figure<br />\nfor many young artists. He is<br />\nknown to have had a kind and<br />\nrespectful demeanor with a very<br />\nstrong will. He always made his<br />\npoints in a very quiet yet forceful<br />\nway. Moore died in April of<br />\n1986.<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art<br />\nis housing an exhibition of his<br />\nwork called Mother and Child,<br />\nthe Art of Henry Moore.<br />\nAlthough Moore spent years with<br />\nthe same subject, his work is<br />\nnever repetitive, never trivial. He<br />\nexplores the relationship between<br />\nthe mother and child in an<br />\n<br />\nevocative, profound manner.<br />\nThe most striking confrontation<br />\nwith his sculpture occurs with the<br />\nfirst piece of the exhibit.<br />\nAwesome in its scale, \"Draped<br />\nReclining Mother and Baby,\" a<br />\nbronze sculpture finished in 1982,<br />\nstems to appropriate the entire<br />\nroom with its presence. The<br />\nshape of the mother has become<br />\namorphous, expanding and curving beyond its \"normal\" borders.<br />\nThe form becomes a cave-like<br />\nspace, enclosing and protecting<br />\nthe baby, defining a territory that<br />\ncannot be entered. The expression the mother's body gives off<br />\nis one of defensiveness and protection. The baby's shape is more<br />\nclearly stylized, and it retains its<br />\ndefinition. The deep tones of the<br />\nbronze further emphasize the<br />\npower and strength embodied in<br />\nthe sculpture.<br />\nMoore's work is essentially<br />\nabout the endurance of the human<br />\nbody, his figures being timeless<br />\n<br />\nand monumental in scale. There<br />\nis a dominance implied in his<br />\nfigures, yet the figures remain noble and dignified.<br />\nMoore's sculptures hark back<br />\nto the qualities that were attributed to the ancient Greek<br />\ngods: indescribable beauty,<br />\nawesome strength, and the power<br />\nof metamorphosis.

In the early sixties, Moore<br />\nmade some sculptures that combined an external with an internal form. Both are organic,<br />\nmolding themselves to each<br />\nother. The outer one is more<br />\ndominant, forming an enclosure<br />\nthat defines the inner shape. The<br />\ninner one has its own power,<br />\ntwisting and contorting within its<br />\nspace. They are interdependent<br />\nand relate entirely to each other.<br />\nIt is not surprizing, then, when<br />\none finds out that the sculpture is<br />\n\"Reclining Mother and Child\"<br />\n(1960). The delicate and intertwined balanced between the<br />\nvulnerable and the omnipotent<br />\nforms of mother and child is<br />\nevidenced even in Moore's less<br />\nabstract, later works. They simply could not function one without<br />\nthe other.<br />\nA large part of the exhibition<br />\nis taken over by Moore's drawings. He made these during wartime, when he lacked money for<br />\nmaterials for his sculptures, and<br />\nwhen his hands began to fail him.<br />\nThe drawings show great diversity in materials (lithographs,<br />\ncharcoal sketches, pastels, etc.)<br />\nand provide excellent insight into Moore's work. They show<br />\nscenes of mothers interacting with<br />\ntheir children. The edge is softer<br />\nhere, the women portrayed are as<br />\nprotective of their children as in<br />\nthe sculptures, yet they seem<br />\nmore vulnerable. The sculptures<br />\nseem to have pitted the mother<br />\nwith her child against the world,<br />\nand the mother stares out at the<br />\nviewer defiantly, ready to defend<br />\n<br />\nher child against the intruder. The<br />\ndrawings, in contrast, show the<br />\nwomen to be playing with and<br />\nholding their children. We seem<br />\nto have caught them in an intimate<br />\nmoment.<br />\nThe last room of the exhibition<br />\nshows some of Moore's earlier<br />\nwork. Here mother and child are<br />\nplaced in a more definite context:<br />\nwith a family, with furniture. The<br />\nother sculptures of this time<br />\nperiod are much more abstract<br />\nand seem too metaphorical and<br />\nimpersonal compared to the later<br />\nworks. Moore still seems to be<br />\nexperimenting with concepts<br />\nrather than form.<br />\nIn all of Moore's work there is<br />\nevidenced an organic, humanistic<br />\ntreatment of the body. His forms<br />\nare often compared to the surrealists', conjuring up images<br />\nfrom the unconscious. But his<br />\nfascination with the human body<br />\nand its outer manifestations<br />\nbetrays him to be grounded in the<br />\n'real'.<br />\nHenry Moore's work is not<br />\nshockingly or openly confrontational. It is easy to like, because<br />\nwe can relate to its themes. His<br />\nworks are sensual, soothing, and<br />\nemotional. The women he portrays are strong and dominant<br />\nwithout being overbearing. They<br />\ncommand our respect.<br />\nThe exhibit at the BMA does<br />\nMoore's work credit. It shows<br />\nMoore's exploration of one subject, his experiments, and his<br />\nevolution as a sculptor.

In the words of the man<br />\nwho wrote the source book, \"It<br />\nis a love story, of course.\" And<br />\nas a film, The Unbearable<br />\nLightness of Being is a compelling, beautiful masterpiece.<br />\nThe film is something of a coup<br />\nfor American cinema. In<br />\nUnbearable Lightness we at last<br />\nhave a film free from cloying<br />\nadolescent sexuality, a film with<br />\na message that avoids didacticism, a film whose craft and art<br />\ncan be spoken of in the same<br />\nbreath as that of Fanny and Alexander. Indeed, Unbearable<br />\nLightness moves with the pleasingly straightforward grace, control, and style of a film which<br />\ntakes its subject matter seriously,<br />\nbut never heavyhandedly. The<br />\ncamera does not flinch, for instance, when one woman kisses<br />\nanother, nor when an entire nation is raped of its character and<br />\nindependence. The audience<br />\ntranscends mere spectatorship; it<br />\nis made to feel that it is the intimate voyeur into some ultimately tragic romance.<br />\nIf Kundera's original was so<br />\nmuch a \"novel of ideas,\" then<br />\ndirector Phillip Kaufman (The<br />\nRight Stuff) has come as close as<br />\n<br />\npossible to creating the visual<br />\nanalogue, layering his film with<br />\nimages startling for their clarity<br />\nand beauty.<br />\nThose familiar with the book<br />\nwill no doubt be surprised at the<br />\ndirector's treatment of the<br />\nmaterial. Here Kaufman, in collaboration with Jean-Claude Carrier, has written a script which<br />\nfollows Kundera's own advice to<br />\n\"eliminate and eliminate, \" a<br />\nscript that excises the book's<br />\nmore abstract philosophical concerns while focusing on the live<br />\ntriangle between Tomas (Daniel<br />\nDay Lewis), his wife Tereza<br />\n(Juliette Binoche), and Sabina<br />\n(Lena Olin).<br />\nAs the film opens, Tomas, an<br />\neminent brain surgeon, must<br />\ntravel to a small town to perform<br />\nemergency surgery.

If anything,<br />\nsuch organizations probably accounted for the rapid rate of<br />\nassimilation of immigrants into<br />\nAmerican society, and such<br />\norganizations help maintain a link<br />\nwith the past. As cultural<br />\norganizations, there is nothing<br />\nwrong with the BSU or the Indian<br />\nStudents Organization or any<br />\nother group, so long as we realize<br />\nthe fact that as long as people<br />\nbelong to these groups, a complete homogeneous integration of<br />\nthese minorities into American<br />\nsociety cannot take place. Those<br />\nwho come from different backgrounds will always regard<br />\nmembers of such organizations as<br />\nThe Other, and will treat them<br />\nwith a certain air of suspicion.<br />\nThis, it would seem, is an<br />\nunavoidable human trait, and<br />\ndespite our best efforts, it is a fear<br />\nwe seem unable to control.<br />\nBecause this fear exists, however,<br />\ndoesn't mean we shouldn't have<br />\nBlack History month, for example. In fact, my only criticism of<br />\nBlack History Month is that the<br />\nmedia seemed to focus on making Black History Month important only to blacks, instead of attempting to show all of us the important contributions that have<br />\nbeen made by Black Americans.<br />\nWhich brings us, finally, to the<br />\npoint of this entire essay:<br />\nspecificially, that a certain<br />\namount of racial and ethnic<br />\nseparation does exist in the<br />\nUnited States, but the media is<br />\nserving to make it an even greater<br />\nand more unbreachable division.<br />\nAs a small example to be expounded upon, let us consider<br />\nsomething we see every day:<br />\ncommercials. When was the last<br />\ntime you saw a white guy in a<br />\nKing Cobra Malt Liquor commercial? A black guy in a Coors<br />\ncommercial? While it can be<br />\nargued that each of these companies is trying to sell to a specific<br />\ndemographic, the example serves<br />\nto point out that there seems to<br />\n<br />\nexist a notion that certain things<br />\nare for black people, and certain<br />\nthings for whites.<br />\nThis same attitude exists on a<br />\nmuch larger level. Consider radio<br />\nstations, for example. Radio stations that want to appeal to a<br />\nblack demographic generally play<br />\nfunk, R&B,jazz, and rap, in any<br />\nnumber of permutations; radio<br />\nstations trying to reach a white<br />\naudience play Top 40, heavy<br />\nmetal, country, and so called<br />\n\"classic\" rock. Again, we can<br />\nsee how, in this case, station<br />\nmanagers have a preconceived<br />\nnotion of certain music being for<br />\nblacks, and certain music being<br />\nfor whites. It is an entirely constructed notion\u2014is their any<br />\nlogical reason, outside of our<br />\ncultural training, to assume that<br />\nblacks will dislike Mel Tillis, or<br />\nwhites Parliament/Funkadelic?<br />\nThis feeling even pervades the<br />\nmusic industry itself\u2014one of the<br />\ncriticisms leveled against the<br />\nBeastie Boys was that they were<br />\nwhite guys messing around in a<br />\n\"black\" medium. At the same<br />\ntime, an organization exists for<br />\nblack artists who are being ignored by the record industry<br />\nbecause they play heavy metal or<br />\njust plain top 40 rock and roll,<br />\nwhich are considered \"white\"<br />\nmedia. What difference, I ask<br />\nyou, does a man's skin color<br />\nmake in the way he plays a chord<br />\nprogression or sings a lyric?<br />\nFor the sake of brevity, and<br />\nbecause my knowledge in this<br />\nfield is strongest, I have stuck to<br />\nthe music industry, but I think<br />\nwith some research we would see<br />\nthe same type of preconceptions<br />\npermeating all the other forms of<br />\nmedia. What we have, essentially, is the continued promotion of<br />\nracial separation through the<br />\nmedia's notion of certain things<br />\nbeing \"for whites,\" and certain<br />\nthings being \"for blacks.\"<br />\nPerhaps the most irritating<br />\nthing about all this is that the<br />\nmedia could do something about<br />\nit, but seems intent on<br />\nperpetuating an intolerable situation. Take, for example, the<br />\ncritical acclaim that has been<br />\nheaped upon rap artists Public<br />\n<br />\nEnemy. The problem is that the<br />\ngroup, Chuck D and Flavor Flay<br />\nare promoting a vision of racial<br />\ndivision and urban terrorism.<br />\nTheir \"bodyguards\" even wear<br />\nammo and carry Uzis (although<br />\nthey claim they aren't loaded).<br />\nWhile their music is certainly<br />\noriginal, they deserve some kind<br />\nof censure for the fact that they<br />\nare promoting racial division and<br />\nviolence: which can only lead to<br />\nfurther distrust, fear, and separation. Here is a case where the<br />\nmedia needs to act in a more<br />\nresponsible fashion, and do<br />\nsomething to promote unity instead of division.<br />\nWhat, then, is the solution?<br />\nVery simple\u2014we need to stop letting the media decide for us what<br />\nour cultural perspectives are going to be. Furthermore, we have<br />\nto break out of the compartmentalization that we have all been<br />\ntaking part in, and get out to explore those things that are normally thought of as being beyond<br />\nour culturally defined tastes.<br />\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm<br />\ngoing to pop open a Schlitz and<br />\nlisten to some R&B.<br />\n<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nWhat, you may ask, do you do<br />\nwhen you're in the mood for<br />\nsomething a little more<br />\nsophisticated than Madonna,<br />\nsomething a little more mellow<br />\nthan Motley Crue?

In the former<br />\ncategory we have Nouveau Calls<br />\nfrom Wishbone Ash (a band<br />\nknown for its twin lead guitars),<br />\nand Guitar and Son from Pete<br />\nHaycock (formerly of the Climax<br />\nBlues Band). Wishbone Ash tends<br />\ntowards a more digital, layered<br />\nsound with overtones of funk and<br />\nclassical guitar, and, as a result,<br />\ntends to be a bit more subdued<br />\nthan Pete Haycock. As the title of<br />\nHaycock's album would seem to<br />\nindicate, the guitar is the central<br />\ncore of his music, with the rest<br />\nof the instrumentation being built<br />\naround it. Haycock's guitar style<br />\n<br />\nis flashier, almost in a heavy<br />\nmetal sense, yet it still manages<br />\nto integrate well with its surroundings and avoid overshadowing<br />\nthe other instruments.<br />\nFor those of you who prefer<br />\nyour music synthesized, we have<br />\nStewart<br />\nCopeland's<br />\nThe<br />\nEqualizer and Other Cliffhangers,as well as William Orbit's Strange Cargo. Copeland's<br />\nalbum, as you might guess, consists of the themes he has scored<br />\nfor the CBS television series The<br />\nEqualizer. In terms of that context, the music is quite good for<br />\nsetting up a visual sequence, but<br />\nin the purely aural context, it<br />\ntends to suffer a bit from the<br />\nlimitations imposed on it.<br />\nCopeland tends to rely a little too<br />\nheavily on such devices as the<br />\nswelling heroic crescendo, and<br />\nsome of the music comes off as<br />\nbeing a bit cliche. I still have to<br />\nadmit, however, that this is my<br />\nfavorite album in the series.<br />\nOrbit might be seen as a compromise between the almost pure<br />\nsynth style of Copeland and the<br />\nguitar style of Haycock. Orbit<br />\nwas formerly with a group called Torch Song, which turned out<br />\ntwo dance club hits before Orbit<br />\ndecided to go solo. This early experience can be heard in the way<br />\nOrbit lays down a very dense percussive track, then layers snatches of guitar, bass, and pure<br />\nsynth sound over top of it. Orbit<br />\nalso has a taste for Latin rhythms,<br />\nwhich lends an exotic flavor to<br />\nmany of these tracks. In his more<br />\nmellow moments, Orbit uses a<br />\nvery minimal style reminiscent of<br />\nPhilip Glass.<br />\nIn all, the No-Speak series provides a variety of styles for the<br />\nlistener in an attempt to reach out<br />\nto a more varied audience than<br />\nNew Age. It's intended for the<br />\ngrown-up rock and roller who<br />\nwants more from his music, but<br />\nstill wants a style that he can<br />\nrecognize and understand. That<br />\ndoesn't mean, however, that the<br />\nrest of us can't enjoy it too.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/29<br />\n<br />\nIS11) ooks<br />\n<br />\nThreat<br />\nby Dina Gan<br />\nI drop my napkin every time the<br />\nwaiter passes by.

His pinky will hook<br />\nmomentarily into my curved index<br />\nfinger, our eyes will meet and we'll<br />\nblush in recognition of our true<br />\nlove. But I've dropped the napkin<br />\nsix times so far and the waiter<br />\ndoesn't even notice. The last time<br />\nhe passes by the napkin lands right<br />\non his foot and he doesn't flinch,<br />\njust kicks the darn thing along, like<br />\nsome deflated football. And I'm out<br />\nof a napkin. I debate stealing one<br />\nfrom the next table. It's almost<br />\nthree. My sister is coming home today. I toss back the last swig of coffee, pressing my tongue flat near the<br />\nrim of the mug,flicking up the last<br />\ndrop.<br />\nI leave the cafe and run the two<br />\nblocks to the train station. The 3:05<br />\nfrom New York is on time and I<br />\nwait outside Gate E, watching<br />\npassengers file out. They all have<br />\nthe same flustered, searching expression that snaps into glad relief<br />\nwhen they find the mother or uncle or sister or lover that came to<br />\nmeet them. The bulk of the<br />\npassengers depart. A minute later<br />\ntwo businessmen wielding briefcases barrel through the doors. I ask<br />\nthe Red Cap attendant and he says<br />\nthat's everyone off the 3:05. I tour<br />\nthe station looking for Effy. I<br />\nwonder if she looks different and if<br />\nmaybe I didn't recognize her. She<br />\nprobably missed the train.<br />\nAnnoyed,I head home. The man<br />\nsitting next to me on the bus is<br />\nfinishing a bag of greasy french<br />\nfries. He wipes his fingers on the<br />\nseat and makes sucking noises with<br />\nhis tongue, trying to scrape off the<br />\npotato mush from his teeth. He<br />\nreaches up to his mouth with his index finger poised, but I jerk my<br />\nhead slightly toward him. His hand<br />\ngoes back down fast. I've been staring out the window but I can tell his<br />\nevery move.<br />\nI get off the bus and walk the rest<br />\nof the way home. Nimrod's van,<br />\nwith the name of his old band The<br />\nFabulous Threat spray-painted on<br />\nthe side, is parked in front of my<br />\n<br />\napartment. I watch from across the<br />\nstreet.<br />\nThere is Effy.<br />\nShe walks like a man. She leans<br />\ninto her left side and takes uneven<br />\nstrides. Her bare calves are like the<br />\nwell-turned forelegs of an antique<br />\nwing chair, squat and solid, jutting<br />\nout from beneath the fringes of her<br />\nlong green suede jacket. The keys<br />\nare cupped in her left hand. she rattles them against her palm, like dice<br />\nbefore a throw. She steps carefully,<br />\nmissing all the cracks in the<br />\nsidewalk leading up to our front<br />\ndoor. Nimrod is right behind her,<br />\nstruggling with two grocery bags.<br />\nHis lanky, black-clad figure could<br />\nbe her shadow. Effy fingers the<br />\nkeys, grasps the right one and lets<br />\nthe others fall together on the ring.<br />\nThe door opens.<br />\nI cross the street and sit on the<br />\nvan bumper,staring at the sidewalk.<br />\nSome kid dropped his marbles when<br />\nthe cement was fresh and they are<br />\nembedded now like colored glass<br />\nislands in a hard gray sea. I step on<br />\nthem but they won't break. I go<br />\ninside.<br />\n\"There you are, Natalie,\" Effy<br />\nsays when she sees me at the kitchen door. \"I took an earlier train<br />\nand Nimrod picked me up at the station. I tried calling but there was<br />\nnobody here.\" Effy takes groceries<br />\nout of the bag and Nimord puts<br />\n<br />\nthem away. A liter of Diet Coke, a<br />\nbox of Sweet-n-Low, some cartons<br />\nof yogurt, and a few Weight Watchers frozen dinners pile on the<br />\ncounter. Effy has purchased two<br />\nbags of groceries containing virtually no caloric value.<br />\n\"I had something at the cafe<br />\nbefore going to meet you,\" I say.<br />\n\"That's why I wasn't here when you<br />\ncalled.\" I squeeze the kitchen<br />\ndoorknob hard, until I smell the<br />\nmixture of the brass and the sweat<br />\nfrom my palm.<br />\nEffy looks up and smiles briefly,<br />\n<br />\nthen starts folding the paper bags.<br />\nHer skin is much clearer than<br />\nbefore. The straggly split ends of<br />\nher hair have been trimmed. Her<br />\nlipstick is pale coral. Her nails are<br />\nuniform and polished. She might<br />\nnave just as well spent the four<br />\nweeks at a health spa than in a drug<br />\ndetoxification program.<br />\nNimrod stares at me. \"Natalie,\"<br />\nhe says. \"You haven't seen your<br />\nsister for a month.

We embrace. \"I<br />\nmissed you,\" she says.<br />\nEffy had said she would miss me<br />\nfour weeks ago when she and<br />\nNimrod were leaving for their<br />\nweekend together in New York.<br />\nThe three of us stand on the curb<br />\nby the van early Friday morning. Effy is wired, not just from excitement. She is wearing her black<br />\nstillettos and half trips over her own<br />\nfeet while throwing her bags into<br />\nthe van. She squeals with laughter<br />\nat her clumsiness. She leans over to<br />\nme and says, \"Just remember one<br />\nthing while I'm gone. If you have<br />\nany guys over, don't screw them on<br />\nmy bed.\" She giggles again and skitters around to the passenger side,<br />\nhoisting herself into the front seat.<br />\nAmused, Nimrod grins and turns to<br />\nme. \"Here's something else to<br />\nremember,\" he whispers, pulling<br />\nme to him. He sticks his tongue on<br />\nthe side of my neck and drags it up<br />\nwetly over my ear the way a dog<br />\nwould. Nimrod bounds into the<br />\ndriver's seat and starts the engine.<br />\nThe van pulls away and Effy<br />\nscreams out of her rolled-down window, \"I'll miss you, Natalie.\" The<br />\nfinal \"e\" of my name trails into her<br />\nhigh-pitched squeal.<br />\nI get the call about Effy's overdose Sunday morning. Nimrod calls<br />\nme from a pay phone at the hospital<br />\nin Manhattan. He is crying. I picture his smirking boyish face,<br />\nalways looking like he just heard a<br />\ncorny joke.

In the preface<br />\nto Major Barbara, he pulls no<br />\npunches and maintains that,<br />\n\". . .our first duty, to which<br />\nevery other consideration should<br />\nbe sacrificed, is not to be poor.\"<br />\nBut the position of Undershaft as<br />\na somewhat sympathetic<br />\ncharacter is Shaw warning the<br />\nradicals that the workers want<br />\njobs and not revolution, as well<br />\nas the fact that they must deal<br />\nwith clever men like Undershaft<br />\nwho would provide the workers<br />\nwith what they want. Indeed.<br />\n<br />\nShaw is trying to draw the<br />\nradicals away from their idealistic<br />\nclouds down to a realistic<br />\nlevel where they can hope to<br />\nachieve their goals, which he still<br />\nshared: social and economic<br />\nequality. But the left must realize<br />\nthat there is a \"bodyguard of<br />\nlaborers whose immediate interests are bound up with those of<br />\nthe capitalists and who<br />\nare. . . more hardened against all<br />\nthe larger social considerations<br />\nthan their masters simply because<br />\nthey are more needy, ignorant<br />\nand irresponsible.\" He was further irritated by the socialist labor<br />\nparty, which attained power in<br />\nEngland in 1924, because they<br />\nfailed to articulate a practical<br />\nsocialist agenda despite their acceptance of the political process<br />\nas a means to their ends. Essentially, now they had power and<br />\nhad no idea what to do with it.<br />\nPower fascinated Shaw and he<br />\nenjoyed the high class hobnobbing which his position as a successful writer brought. But he<br />\ndidn't lose the point of view that<br />\nthe value in steadily improving<br />\nthe working class' lot through<br />\neducation, social insurance<br />\nschemes and nationalized industry lay in that it would eventually displace the upper classes,<br />\nprovided the Fabians stressed the<br />\nidea of social and economic<br />\nequaltiy all the way through. If<br />\nthey failed to articulate this goal<br />\nof equality as the motivation<br />\nbehind their reforms, the<br />\nresulting system could only be<br />\nanother form of capitalism,<br />\n<br />\none carrying a small pail and the<br />\nother smoking a cigarette.

I'm<br />\nwriting this to clarify a few<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe first reaction that I received from Mr. Scott, the Athletic<br />\nDirector, and Dean Colombo was<br />\nthat Drug and Alcohol Awareness<br />\nand Education should be a campus wide issue. Pursuit of a mandatory program for athletes was<br />\nbiased and unfair.<br />\nAt that time and many times<br />\nfollowing, I have stated that Drug<br />\nand Alcohol Awareness/Education should be a campus-wide effort. In no way have I singled the<br />\nathletes out\u2014they are one of<br />\nmany groups which may be addressed. To quote myself, \"it's<br />\na multiple front problem and this<br />\nis one front.\"<br />\nEven with such statements, I<br />\nwas/am still misunderstood. The<br />\nissue was taken to student council a few weeks ago. The publicity that lively council meeting<br />\ngenerated got some reaction.

Dean Colombo's office last Friday afternoon<br />\nwith the hope of clearing up some<br />\nmisunderstandings.<br />\nAt the beginning of the<br />\nmeeting, it was made clear once<br />\nagain that no team or individual<br />\nwas being accused of anything,<br />\nnor were the athletes being<br />\nsingled out.<br />\nMr. Scott then explained that<br />\nmost coaches usually mention<br />\nsomething about drugs and<br />\nalcohol at the beginning of each<br />\nseason.<br />\nQuestions quickly followed.<br />\nWere all the teams getting this<br />\ntreatment? Were the coaches<br />\nqualified to provide the necessary<br />\ninformation? . . .to recognize the<br />\nsigns?<br />\nThe conversation, which at<br />\ntimes became heated, bounced<br />\nback and forth. This is no place<br />\nto repeat verbatim what was said.<br />\nAll the participants in the meeting<br />\nwere concerned with helping the<br />\nstudent body. Hopkins is fortunate to have an excellent<br />\nAthletic Program run by some<br />\nvery qualified people. Being<br />\nqualified, being an adult, doesn't<br />\nnecessarily mean that education<br />\nand awareness don't need to<br />\nbe/shouldn't be heightened.

Dean Colombo has<br />\npromised that Mr. Scott will reevaluate the coaches\u2014both fulland part-time coaches. \"Mr.<br />\nScott will hold conversation with<br />\nthe coaches and make the assessment whether more training is<br />\nneeded,\" explained Colombo,<br />\nwhile stressing that students must<br />\nalso participate in the awareness<br />\n<br />\nand education effort.<br />\nMr. Scott, after hearing the<br />\npositive response a speaker like<br />\nMike Green has had speaking on<br />\nalcohol, has agreed to try such a<br />\nprogram next year with the<br />\nathletes before the beginning of<br />\ntheir respective seasons. One of<br />\nMr. Scott's biggest objections to<br />\nsuch speaker programs had been<br />\nthe negative feedback received<br />\nfrom attending students in the<br />\npast.<br />\nThat's where matters stand for<br />\nnow . . .<br />\nI've been approached by<br />\nathletes who have gone on to tell<br />\nme how useless a drug and<br />\nalcohol awareness program<br />\nwould be.

A<br />\npolished, veteran team, with<br />\nenough young spark (Seitzer,<br />\nStillwell) to keep them going. The<br />\namazing thing about the Royals<br />\nlast year was that they were<br />\nshutout so many times despite<br />\nhaving an offensive nucleus of<br />\nBrett, Seitzer (.323), Tartabull<br />\n(101 RBI's), Balboni (24 HR), and<br />\nJackson (22 HR). Even the<br />\nsecond baseman, Frank White, hit<br />\n17 homers. Granted, Balboni .is<br />\ngone, but with that kind of power<br />\ncore and with John Wathan emphasizing more speed (he holds<br />\nthe record for stolen bases by a<br />\ncatcher-32), I don't think the<br />\nRoyals are going to have trouble<br />\n<br />\nscoring runs this year.

Drachman peppered these successes with some<br />\nother interesting information<br />\nabout the physicians in the<br />\nwomen's hospitals and got a few<br />\ngasps and comments from the audience. First, the women doctors<br />\nwere generally unmarried, the<br />\nage frowning upon women raising a family and leading a professional life simultaneously. Nurses<br />\nwere apparently treated even just<br />\nas badly in the women's hospitals<br />\nas in the men's, their jobs basically comprising \"menial and<br />\nhousehold work with few<br />\nresponsibilities.\"<br />\nThe days of separation did not<br />\nlast long, however, as signs of integration began appearing in the<br />\nearly twentieth century with the<br />\nadmission of female medical<br />\nstudents to some of the nation's<br />\ntop schools and the ever-opening<br />\ndoors to women in internships<br />\nand residencies, especially in the<br />\nlarge urban centers. The N.E.<br />\nHospital and the N.Y. Infirmary<br />\ncontinued to train female physicians exclusively, claiming that<br />\ntheir institutions \"provided the<br />\nbest training for women for their<br />\nfuture practices.\" As science progressed and the old ideas among<br />\nleaders in medicine turned to a<br />\nmore \"empirical, objective, and<br />\nreductionist\" way of thought, the<br />\ncontributions of doctors began to<br />\nNOTES, from 36<br />\nAPTT Counselors: Consultation sections meet this week Sunday at 500 in<br />\nthe White House Conference Room;<br />\nTuesday at 12:00 in Conference Room<br />\nB; and Thursday at 1:00 in Gilman 42.<br />\nIf you have any problems or questions,<br />\ncall Vicki.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Jewish League<br />\npresents \"The Russian Connection\",<br />\na film covering the links between the<br />\nSoviet Union, the PLO and world terrorism.

World War II was<br />\nan important turning point for the<br />\nfemale physicians as the shortage<br />\nof young men in the country<br />\nmade it necessary to offer the internship and residency positions<br />\nof the nation's hospitals to<br />\nwomen. In a tell-tale statistic cited<br />\nby Drachman, in 1941, 105<br />\nhospitals in the U.S. accepted<br />\nwomen for residencies. One year<br />\nlater, the number jumped to 358<br />\nand gradual gains were continued<br />\nthroughout the war and into the<br />\npost war period. By the 1950's<br />\nthe integration process of women<br />\nwas well underway and the<br />\nwomen's hospitals began waning<br />\nin importance and many felt that<br />\nthey had become obsolete. Symbolic of this period of integration<br />\nwas the acceptance of male physicians on staff at the N.Y.

The DoD,she said, purportedly gives universities access<br />\nto the foremost technology, provides more money than the<br />\ncivilian sector, and provides a<br />\nlong-term commitment.<br />\nIn contrast, she said, is the National Science Foundation, where<br />\nresearchers need to continually<br /><br />\nrenew their contracts. Also, she<br />\nsaid, DoD funding is, in fact,<br />\ngood for the U.S. economy and<br />\nis vital to national security.<br />\nKistiakowsky proceeded to<br />\ncritique this argument. She saw<br />\nthe solution of protecting national<br />\nsecurity lying in political and<br />\ndiplomatic measures.<br />\nAs for economic consequences;<br />\nKistiakowsky pointed to Japan as<br />\na country that has not contributed<br />\nto any sizable military research,<br />\nbut has dramatically increased its<br />\neconomic standing after postWorld War II disarmament. In<br />\ncontrast, the U.S. is the world's<br />\nlargest debtor nation. Whether or<br />\nnot this situation resulted from<br /><br />\nEric Moyer<br /><br />\nThe Graduate Representative Organization sponsored Kistiakowsky, moderator Stuart Leslie of the Departa symposium on the relationship between government, ment of History of Science, professor Clark Thomborcorporations, and universities.

Furthermore, Kistiakowsky believed<br />\nthat government tries to quell<br />\ncritics of its programs. \"When<br />\npeople get the money [to do<br />\nresearch], they buy into the<br />\nsystem,\" she said.<br />\nThe solution Kistiakowsky offered entailed government support for diversified basic research<br />\nbalanced with research of \"national priority.''<br />\nFeldman argued that militaryfunded research is not beneficial<br />\nto the U.S. economy. Feldman<br />\nattributed most of the U.S. trade<br />\ndeficit to excess government funding of weapons-geared research<br />\n\"because hi-tech capacity is<br />\ndiverted to the military.\"<br />\nFeldman accused universities<br />\nthat receive DoD funding of intentionally developing \"militarycentered undergraduate curricula.\" International relations,<br />\nhe believed, teaches arms control<br />\ntheory as a rationale for escalation of nuclear weapons. \"The<br />\nuniversity has become the supporting pillar for military intervention policy,\" he said.<br />\n\"Courses on comprehensive<br />\ndisarmament theory are not<br />\ngenerally available.\"<br />\nIn a pamphlet for the National<br /><br />\nCommission for Economic Conversion &amp; Disarmament,<br />\nFeldman wrote, \"universities,<br />\nlike prime military contractors,<br />\nwill resist conversion [from<br />\nmilitary research to non-military,<br />\nbasic research] unless they are<br />\nforced by legal and political<br />\nmeans.\"<br />\nFeldman advocated the National Conversion Legislation<br />\ncurrently in Congress as a nonutopian way of weaning universities from dependence on DoD<br />\nfunding. If passed, the bill would<br />\nmake mandatory the formation of<br />\ncommittees that would plan a<br />\npeaceful agenda for research.<br />\nIf this bill were passed, said<br />\nFeldman, the trade deficit would<br />\nshrink because of a vast diversion<br />\nof resources from defense and<br />\ntoward<br />\nconsumer-oriented<br />\ntechnology, which would boost<br />\nthe marketability of U.S. goods<br />\nworldwide. Furthermore, the<br />\ncountry's welfare as a whole<br />\nwould improve as more dollars<br />\nwould be devoted to research on<br />\nrecycling and discovering alternate sources of energy.<br />\nHopkins' controversial Applied<br />\nPhysics Lab was, however, not<br />\nsignificantly mentioned in the<br />\nforum eventhough it receives<br />\nmuch of its funding from the<br />\nDoD.

Reprinted with permission.<br />\nWASHINGTON<br /><br />\nDavid W. Breneman, president of Kalamazoo<br />\nCollege, thinks the nation's 100 most expensive and<br />\nselective private colleges are engaging in<br />\n\"lemming-like behavior\" when it comes to setting<br />\ntuition rates, and he admits that he is following the<br />\ncrowd himself. (Tuition at Kalamazoo is $8,998 this<br />\nyear; next year's has not been determined.)<br />\nAt a recent conference here on college costs sponsored by the National Center for Postsecondary<br />\nFinance and Governance, and in an interview afterward, Mr. Breneman explained his views. He said<br />\nthat although the public was growing increasingly<br />\nuneasy about rising tuitions, he and others at private<br />\ncolleges were observing a paradoxical phenomenon:<br />\nthe higher their prices, the larger their applicant<br />\npool.<br />\n\"All of us are beginning to realize that to some<br />\ndegree in this market, people judge quality by price,<br />\nand that a low price at a private college is not<br />\nnecessarily a sign of good management,\" he said.<br />\n\"I really do think there is a changing mindset in<br />\nhigher education now, and it's been spreading out<br />\nfrom the most elite and selective core to some of<br />\nus who are in the next echelon, where<br />\nincreasingly\u2014rightly or wrongly\u2014we are seeing<br />\nprice as a statement to the public of who we are,\"<br />\nhe continued.<br />\nMr. Breneman said he thought peer pressure was<br />\nresponsbile for one or two percentage points of the<br />\nannual tuition increases of selective private colleges.<br />\nHe hastened to add that, by and large, colleges<br />\nwere spending their tuition revenues wisely.<br />\n\"Nobody is making any profits in private higher<br />\neducation,\" he said. \"We'remot squirreling money<br />\naway, and we're not giving profits to stockholders.<br />\nWe raise it and we spend it in a neverending chase<br />\nto enhance the quality of our programs.\"<br />\nThis year, for example, Kalamazoo decided to<br />\nadd an East Asian studies program, a new cost that<br />\nwill be reflected in tuition.<br />\nMr. Breneman said his views on the subject had<br />\nbeen sharpened by an article by Barry Werth in the<br />\nJanuary issue of New England Monthly, \"Why Is<br /><br />\nCollege So Expensive?\" The subtitle gave the<br />\nanswer: \"One reason only, Mr. and Mrs. America:<br />\nYou want it that way.\" The article profiled the costly and successful strategy that Mount Holyoke College had followed to improve its quality and keep<br />\nenrollments high.<br />\nMr. Breneman said he could not afford not to<br />\nkeep up with the competition. He would not serve<br />\nKalamazoo well, he said, if he raised tuition 6 percent while peer institutions raised it 7 or 8 percent.<br />\nThe other colleges would have more money to spend<br />\nto improve their programs, and Kalamazoo would<br />\nfall behind. After a few years of slower-thanaverage increases, his college would lose its competitive position \"both in perception and in reality.\"<br />\n'Prisoners of Others'<br />\nKeeping up with the pack exacts a steep price,<br />\naccording to Mr. Breneman. \"It makes us prisoners<br />\nof others,\" he said, and can lead colleges to make<br />\n\"excessive and distasteful\" quality improvements.<br />\nIn addition, he said, it breaks an implicit contract<br />\nwith parents that costs will not go up unreasonably<br />\nwhile their children are enrolled. \"If there are three<br />\nyears of 9-per-cent increases, by the fourth year,<br />\nparents are buying a very different product,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nHe believes that private colleges are in danger of<br />\nlosing their integrity by telling parents that tuitions<br />\nare rising solely because of factors such as the rising costs of faculty salaries, laboratory equipment,<br />\nand computers. \"There's a competitive dimension<br />\nto our increases,\" he said, \"and some of that spending is discretionary.\"<br />\nMr. Breneman thinks that no one college can<br />\nbreak the back of this internally generated tuition<br />\ninflation. With collective action, however, he thinks<br />\nthe cost run-up could be ended. \"If we would all<br />\ngo up two points less, we'd all live, we'd all be just<br />\nfine,\" he said.<br />\nHe believes that publicizing the issue would help,<br />\ntoo. Once the strategy is exposed, he said, college<br />\npresidents might find it more difficult to tell parents<br />\nless than the full truth.<br />\n\u2014JEAN EVANGELAUF<br /><br />\n51-<br /><br />\nHarvard<br />\nthis<br />\nsummer<br />\nJune 27\u2014August 19, 1988<br /><br />\n1743.<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\narvard Summer<br />\nSchool offers open-enrollment in day and evening<br />\ncourses.

The Milton S.<br />\nEisenhower Library will use the<br />\nbasement as storage space.<br />\n\"Originally, the Shaffer addition was to provide swing space<br />\nfrom displacements in Gilman<br />\nHall,\" said Schuerholz. \"Now<br />\nwe're reviewing many projects<br />\nand are not sure if those plans will<br />\nremain pat.\"<br />\nScheduled at first to coincide<br />\nwith the completion of the Shaffer addition, the renovation of<br />\nGilman Hall may not begin this<br />\nspring.<br />\n\"We're not sure when the<br />\nwork will begin,\" said<br />\nSchuerholz, \"but we have the<br />\ndesign plans essentially complete<br />\nfor the renovation of Gilman<br />\nHall.\"<br />\nRenovations to the building,<br />\naccording to Schuerholz, will include installing new heating and<br />\ncooling systems, upgrading the<br />\npresent electrical system, bringing the building up to current fire<br />\nand safety standards, and doing<br />\ngeneral refurbishment and<br />\npainting.<br />\n\"At 140,000 square feet,<br />\nGilman Hall is the largest<br /><br />\nbuilding on campus except for the<br />\nMSE Library,\" said Schuerholz.<br />\n\"Renovation will entail a lot of<br />\nwork just because of the<br />\nbuilding's sheer size.\"<br />\nSchuerholz estimated that<br />\nrenovation, once begun, would \u2022<br />\ntake approximately twenty<br />\nmonths to complete and would<br />\ncost $10 million.<br />\nReferring to Gilman Hall's<br />\nstatus as a designated historic<br />\nlandmark, Schuerholz asserted,<br />\n\"We're going to do everything<br />\npossible to maintain the<br />\nbuilding's beautiful ambiance and<br />\ncharacter. In addition, whatever<br />\nwe plan to do to the outside of the<br />\nstructure will have to be approved by CHAP, the Committee for<br />\nHistorical and Architectural<br />\nPreservation.\"<br />\nPhase I of renovation to Ames<br />\nHall is now complete.

Phase II, involving renovation of the second,<br />\nthird, and fourth floors of the<br />\nstructure, is presently underway,<br />\nand is scheduled to be complete<br />\nby September, 1988.<br />\nAs far as total cost is concerned, \"we'll be very close to the<br />\n$9.5 million projected cost,\" said<br />\nSchuerholz.<br />\nWhile the Department of<br />\nPsychology faculty members<br />\ndisplaced by Phase I have returned to their offices, occupants of<br />\nthe second, third, and fourth<br />\nfloors of the building have been<br />\nforced into temporary quarters in<br /><br />\nMergenthaler Hall and at the<br />\nRotunda.<br />\n\"Renovation in Ames was<br />\ndone in phases to accommodate<br />\nfaculty members using the facility,\" explained Schuerholz.<br />\n\"Whenever you renovate a structure with occupants in the<br />\nbuilding it's always difficult for<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nEventually, Ames will be occupied by the Department of<br />\nGeography and Environmental<br />\nEngineering, Psychology, and<br />\nthree faculty members of the<br />\nDepartment of History.<br />\nInitiated with a groundbreaking<br />\nceremony on October 5, 1987,<br />\nconstruction continues on the<br />\nPhysics and Astronomy building,<br />\nlocated in the wooded knoll<br />\nacross from the Space Telescope<br />\nScience Institute on San Martin<br />\nDrive.<br />\nTermed by the November 1987<br />\nedition of the Facilities Managemert Construction Update as<br />\n\"the largest and most expensive<br />\nproject ever undertaken at the<br />\nHomewood campus,\" the<br />\n230,000 square foot structure is<br />\nscheduled for completion in<br />\nJanuary, 1990.<br />\nThe $35 million building will<br />\nconsist of separate research and<br />\nteaching wings joined by what<br />\nSchuerholz termed \"a beautiful<br />\nand functional lobby-reception<br />\narea.\" The lobby will be open<br />\nthrough three stories of the<br />\nbuilding and will be surrounded<br />\nby common areas such as a lecture hall, a reading room, and the<br /><br />\n% t<br /><br />\n4,111\u2018<br /><br />\n1.7<br /><br />\n.410,<br />\nJ<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022<br />\nArlett-s<br /><br />\nRichard A.

Lee Davis<br /><br />\nChoosing Perspective<br />\nStudents will be going to the polls on<br />\nTuesday to select next year's Student Council executives and to narrow the field of<br />\ncandidates for the position of Young<br />\nTrustee.<br />\nFour candidates are battling for Student<br />\nCouncil President: Paul Diamond, Junior<br />\nClass Vice President Michael Fenzel,<br />\nSophomore Class President Lou<br />\nGiangiulio, and Junior Class Secretary<br />\nQuentin Snider.<br />\nAll of the candidates stress, at least<br />\namong their top priorities, that the responsibility of Council is to provide more social<br />\nprogramming for students.<br />\nThis tenet is not one which The NewsLetter wholeheartedly supports. Recent<br />\nyears have shown two developments: creation of the HOP, and growing student interest in and sensitivity to the \"important\"<br />\nissues.<br />\nThe purpose of the HOP is to oversee and<br />\nsponsor social programming. By design,<br />\nthe HOP more effectively and efficiently<br />\nundertakes programming, freeing up Council members to face the various concerns<br />\nof the student body.<br />\n\"Important\" issues are, of course hard<br />\nto determine, because importance is<br />\nrelative. Nevertheless, issues over the recent years, such as South African divestment, honor code, and even more recently<br />\nreplacing Dean Welch, have sparked student concern.<br />\nHopkins students are reaching a maturity level which enables them to perceive the<br />\nmany problems on our campus in a more<br />\ncohesive manner. Our community is beginning to see that there are similarities bet-<br /><br />\nween academic \"throatism\" and sexual intolerance and insufficient on-campus housing. The issue these and other problems boil<br />\ndown to, one that is effectively brought out<br />\nby the Human Climate Task Force report,<br />\nis that much of what Hopkins is today<br />\nfosters a lack of campus community,and accordingly a disrespect and intolerance for<br />\nothers.<br />\nThere is much that needs to be done\u2014<br />\nphysically to the campus and to the Hopkins<br />\npsyche\u2014to address this problem. It is<br />\ndisturbing that the candidates still place so<br />\nmuch emphasis on Council's social programming functions, given the HOP's success this year and that the Task Force report<br />\noutlined a number of \"important\" issues.<br />\nIt is even more disturbing that some of the<br />\ncandidates suggest that a study break or a<br />\nparty will solve our problems.<br />\nOnly Lou Giangiulio displays, perhaps<br />\nbecause of his experience, perspective on<br />\nthe larger issues. Lou has distinguished<br />\nhimself during his two years on Council as<br />\npresident of the freshman and sophomore<br />\nclasses. He, too, lays emphasis on Council's role as a social programmer.<br />\nHowever, his words on these pages reflect<br />\nthat he views social events as a means<br />\ntoward rallying students and motivating<br />\nthem to then engage other issues. He has<br />\na solid notion of integrating all facets of the<br />\nHopkins community.<br />\nCouncil needs someone to look with<br />\nbroad perspective at the problems facing the<br />\nHopkins community, and address the \"important\" issues which can effect improvement. We think that Lou is the best man<br />\nfor this job.<br /><br />\nThe Dynasty Continues<br />\nYou just know it's that time of year<br />\nagain. Young Trustee and Student Council candidates become especially visible.<br />\nSpring Break is just around the corner and<br />\n\"lacrosse\" is the word around campus.<br />\nIf there's anything that typifies Hopkins<br />\nmore than pre-meds, it's lacrosse. It's the<br />\nage-old tradition which drives even the<br />\nzeekiest out of the library on Saturday afternoons to support the team.<br />\nThe Hopkins lacrosse fan is a faithful<br />\none\u2014and an educated one. The Hopkins<br />\nfan knows to cheer, not just when the team<br />\nscores, but when they make an excellent<br />\nplay or a save as well. The Hopkins fan appreciates a challenge more than they do a<br />\nwin; last season's semi-final win against<br />\nfirst-ranked Maryland meant more to him<br />\nthan the championship game against Cornell. Of course winning the title back made<br /><br />\nthings that much sweeter.<br />\nIt all may be due to the fact that lacrosse<br />\nis Hopkins' only Division I sport, the one<br />\nteam for which we consistently receive nationwide recognition. This makes things all<br />\nthat much more special for a school which<br />\nunfortunately often seems to offer many of<br />\nits students little else. It is our thing\u2014<br />\nsomething to brag about.<br />\nHopkins has many talented athletes who<br />\nwork very hard at what they do. But when<br />\nthe Jays meet Syracuse out on that field<br />\ntomorrow the entire lacrosse world\u2014and<br />\nHopkins\u2014will be watching. They'll be watching to see if the Jays can hold out against<br />\nthe Orange, even without goalie Quint<br />\nKessenich, and they'll be watching to see<br />\nwhat's in store for the team this season: will<br />\nthe dynasty continue...<br /><br />\ntape.

This issue<br />\nis so important it deserves<br />\nelaboration, and so I shall<br />\nelaborate on a number of points,<br />\nat the risk of appearing redundant. More than the political<br />\nphilosophy of voting in a<br />\ndemocracy, however, I would<br />\nlike to specifically address the<br />\ntechnical difficulties one encounters as one prepares to vote<br />\nin this country.<br />\nThe purpose of Culp's article<br />\nas well as this diatribe is to get<br />\nall of you to vote. I believe that<br />\nmost people on this campus are<br />\nbright enough to want to vote,<br />\nand that the main thing holding<br />\nthem back is the lack of<br />\nknowledge about the bureaucratic<br />\nobstacle course standing in their<br />\nway. The Young Democrats<br />\nrecently put out a flyer on how to<br />\nbecome enfranchised, but I personally felt that, although it was<br /><br />\nan honorable gesture, it was not<br />\nenough.<br />\nThe flyer detailed what one<br />\nneeds to do to vote: register with<br />\nyour state (or county in massive<br />\nstates like NY), apply for an<br />\nabsentee ballot if you are out of<br />\nstate, or go to the polls. All of this<br />\nrequires a certain amount of<br />\nlegwork, which, understandably,<br />\nnot everyone is willing to do. In<br />\nthe cause of efficiency, I have<br />\ncontacted the Election Boards of<br />\nNY, NJ, and PA and found out<br />\nhow to help people vote, and the<br />\nresponse has been quite<br />\nfavorable. In my room at this moment there sit: Absentee Ballot<br />\nApplications from New York<br />\nState and Pennsylvania, as well as<br />\nregistration forms from Pennsylvania. I should be receiving<br />\nNew Jersey forms presently. For<br />\nyour general information, it's too<br />\nlate to register for the primary in<br />\nNew York and all Super Tuesday<br />\nstates (that includes Maryland,<br />\nthe rest of the South, and a few<br /><br />\nother states), but already<br />\nregistered voters can still get<br />\nabsentee ballots.<br />\nSO CALL ME!!! I can get the<br />\nnecessary forms to you in a jiffy,<br />\nand if I don't have them, I will<br />\nbe more than happy to order them<br />\nfor you.

Rest assured that<br />\neveryone still has ample time to<br />\nregister for the November general<br />\nelection.

Fayette at noon, well ahead of<br />\nthe prescribed test time of 1:00<br />\np.m. I walked into the front door<br />\nand was greeted by an older, burly gentleman wearing the uniform<br />\nof a police officer. I was ordered<br />\nto fill out a form, and was given<br />\na visitor's pass that entitled me to<br />\ngo only to the seventh floor,<br />\nthereby eliminating any ideas I<br />\nhad about perambulating around<br />\nthe place to have a look-see.<br />\nI took the elevator up, and<br />\nwalked into the Recruiting Unit,<br />\nwhere every head turned (I am<br />\nserious), and a woman who obviously had just found out that her<br />\nhouse had been foreclosed upon<br />\nand her dog shot scowled in a<br />\nvoice that can only be described<br /><br />\nPolice Force Quizzing<br /><br />\nas malicious, \"Can I help<br />\nyou?!?\" I said,\"W-w-w-why yy-yes ma'am.

I did as I was<br />\ntold, and sat down in the waiting<br />\nroom, a place I would get to<br />\nknow very well in the coming<br />\nmonths. As I sat there, I looked<br />\naround at the sparse furnishings.<br />\nA sign on the wall said, \"Ap-<br /><br />\nplicants are advised not to discuss<br />\nthe application process, with each<br />\nother, as this will impede the processing.\" The Hopkins student in<br />\nme couldn't help but notice the incorrect grammar, but I felt it wise<br />\nnot to go back in and tell the<br />\nbellicose secretary, lest she give<br />\na flying kick to my midriff.<br />\nI sat quietly for about a half an<br />\nhour, at which time an officer<br />\nmotioned for me to re-enter the<br />\nrecruiting toom.

In<br />\nfact, the night after I wrote the<br />\ncolumn panning the cafeteria I<br />\nwent down to dinner just after<br />\nseven, and was thoroughly<br />\ndisgusted that I would either have<br />\nto stand in the only line open to<br /><br />\nget food that I won't eat, pick<br />\nthrough a devastated salad bar, or<br />\ntake my repast elsewhere.<br />\nSo for the first time in my nearly six months at Hopkins, I went<br />\nto complain, and was directed to<br />\nDirector of Dining Services Mary<br />\nColatori, known affectionately to<br />\nmost as just Mary, who asked<br />\nwhat I thought was wrong. She<br />\npointed out a few things that in<br />\npast nights would have satisfied<br />\nme, but did not disagree that I had<br />\nno basis to be dissatisfied on that<br />\nnight. She did not become defensive, much to her credit.<br />\nThen we talked for a good fifteen minutes about what I thought<br />\nwould improve the service. As I<br />\nmust confess that I'm not sure<br />\nwhat I really want other than a<br />\nkitchen of my own open 24 hours<br />\ndaily, I was somewhat on the<br />\nspot. But I did come up with a<br /><br />\nfew suggestions, with a little<br />\nsteering provided by Mary. She<br />\nthen informed me that certain of<br />\nmy recommendations would be<br />\nlooked after immediately, and<br />\nmany of them would follow<br />\nshortly thereafter. I have seen<br />\nmuch progress made toward the<br />\nsuggestions of students so<br />\ncarefully posted on napkins on the<br />\nsuggestions board, so I was inclined to believe that something<br />\npositive will be done.<br />\nI suppose that a short period of<br />\ntime will determine whether I will<br />\nhave to walk out of the cafeteria<br />\ndisappointed and hungry again. I<br />\ncertainly hope that the changes I<br />\ndiscussed with Mary will take<br />\nplace.

These will be the people<br />\nwho run your Student Council,<br />\nselect your chairmen for Orientation, MSE Symposium, and<br />\nSpring Fair, and generally get all<br />\nthe heat and hype in the NewsLetter for trying to convey the<br />\nAdministration and others what is<br />\nin your, the student body's, best<br />\ninterest.<br />\nI bet everyone who goes out to<br />\nvote on Tuesday, March 8 would<br />\nlike to have a clear-cut line on<br />\nwho the best person to vote for<br />\nwould be. In this issue, the NewsLetter is running an election profile based on personal interviews,<br />\nwhich is good. But wouldn't it be<br />\neven better to hear what the candidates have to say for themselves<br />\nin an open forum and to address<br />\nyour own personal complaints or<br />\nsuggestions face-to-face?<br />\nThere was, in fact, such a<br />\nforum on Monday night,<br />\nFebruary 29, in the AMR I multipurpose room, and, of the handful on hand to hear the platforms<br />\nof those running for office, I can<br />\ntell you for a fact that even fewer<br />\nwere there of their own free will.<br />\nI was not surprised by the turnout, since this has been the typical<br />\nresponse for such forums in the<br />\npast. Also, many people are<br />\neither too busy or think they have<br />\ntheir minds made up to vote for<br />\nsomeone they may know personally. But of these two reasons,<br />\nI would prefer the former to the<br />\nlatter.<br />\nI am not going to preach on the<br />\ndisgruntled view that most<br />\nHopkins elections are popularity<br />\ncontests. The elections process<br />\nhas been good to me in the past,<br />\nand I believe that if a person is<br />\ninvolved and active enough to be<br />\nwell-known and well-liked, they<br />\nprobably have the qualities to be<br />\na good student leader. But for the<br />\nstudent who has recently decided<br />\nto take on more responsibility and<br />\nis trying to more actively participate in the school, the lack of<br />\nattendance at a forum such as the<br />\none last Monday night gives it the<br />\nappearance of a mere triviality,<br />\nand works against what the idea<br />\nof student government should be.<br />\nI won't deceive you; I am one<br />\nof the candidates running for office. But I am also a student,just<br />\nlike yourselves, and whether I<br />\nwin or lose, I would like to feel<br />\nthat it was because the majority<br />\nof the student body voted in a<br />\nresponsible manner. It is the<br />\nlarger responsibility of those running to make themselves visible<br />\nto the students and to do what<br />\nthey can to get their views made<br />\npublic so that you can make this<br />\ndecision.

While never<br />\ndealing with these causes as a<br />\nbody, SC takes credit for social<br />\nevents such as P.T. Flagg's night,<br />\nHoppy Hour, Sophomore Dinner<br />\nat PizzApeel, and the Valentine's Dance that were made<br />\npossible by the individual classes<br />\nand the HOP.<br />\nWe have failed collectively to<br />\naddress other questions. All we<br />\nseem to do is sit for forty-five<br />\nminutes and listen to listless committee reports. The problem isn't<br />\nthat the committees don't report<br />\noften enough, rather that they<br />\ngive us little to work with. Six<br />\nmonths ago, the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force concluded that<br />\nracism, sexism, and general intolerance are prevalent at<br />\nHomewood. Yet the only time we<br />\neven discussed issues of concern<br />\nhave been the few times we've<br />\nbeen forced by the Administration, suct, as the reform of the<br />\nAdd/Drop system and Orientation<br />\nchairperson selection. The gnawing fear of most of the council<br />\nseems to be that the Coalition<br />\n(ugh) might start complaining<br />\nagain. Few council members<br />\nhave any drive to justify their<br />\nposition and come to Council<br />\nwith issues. Every week we are<br />\nbombarded with demands from<br />\nour President to spend money,<br />\nostensibly for social programming. Surely, there must be other<br />\nuses for our $15,000 than only<br />\nsocial events, which already have<br />\nan allocated budget through the<br />\nHOP.<br />\nCouncil this year became one<br />\nbig cruise line, designed only to<br />\nkeep you happy with another beer<br />\nuntil your next exam. While certain improvements to the condition of life have been made, we<br />\nare letting down the students by<br />\nnot addressing core issues such as<br />\nthose detailed by the H.C.T.F. In<br />\ncase you don't believe this, please<br />\ncome to any council meeting<br />\nWednesday at 8 in the Shriver<br />\nBoard Room. We could use a little prodding.<br />\nGeorge Lerner<br /><br />\nYT: Summing Up<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI learned, to some amusement<br />\non Monday night, that due to the<br />\nlarge number of candidates for<br />\nYoung Trustee this year, each of<br />\nus would have the privilege of<br />\nsumming up our candidacies in<br />\ntwo (count 'em) sentences. With<br />\na finite News-Letter budget, a<br />\nlacrosse insert, and upcoming<br />\nStudent Council elections, it is<br />\nunderstandable that space is<br />\nlimited. What concerns me is the<br />\nmanner in which this space is being used.<br />\nIn the limited space allotted to<br />\neach candidate is included their<br />\npicture, birth date, hometown,<br />\nactivities at JHU, and the amazing two sentences. Are these the<br />\nmost pertinent pieces of information the electorate should be<br />\naware of when voting for this<br />\nposition? I hardly think so.<br />\nWhy the picture? This is an<br />\nelection for a position on the<br />\n&amp;<br /><br />\n.4 \u2022\u20224<br /><br />\nS<br /><br />\nBoard of Trustees, not a beauty<br />\ncontest (a fact for which I am<br />\ngrateful). Why the birth date? Is<br />\nan Aquarius better suited for the<br />\nBoard than a Capricorn? And<br />\nregional biases notwithstanding,<br />\nof what worth is hometown? Activities are a bit more nettlesome.<br />\nThere is much temptation to<br />\nbelieve that there are actually<br />\nundergraduate activities which<br />\ncan prepare one for becoming a<br />\nTrustee of this University. To<br />\nunderstand that this is not the case<br />\nrequires an understanding of what<br />\nthe Young Trusteeship is all<br />\nabout.<br />\nWhat, then, is Trusteeship<br />\nabout? The answer would not only include the official duties of the<br />\nTrustees, which are found in the<br />\nJust One Spot brochure and<br />\nshould be in the News-Letter, but<br />\nalso the unofficial roles. By this<br />\nI mean that the position is what<br />\nthe holder can make of it. Just<br />\nwhat each candidate plans to<br />\nmake of it, then, is the pertinent<br />\ninformation, unfortunately<br />\nlimited to two sentences by the<br />\nNews-Letter staff. Such a pity.<br />\nThus a sad situation exists, and<br /><br />\nI will not make it worse by trying to use this space to further my<br />\nown candidacy as I was tempted<br />\nto. Rather, I will urge all the<br />\nreaders of this letter to please read<br />\ncarefully the full statements<br />\nwhich will be appearing in your<br />\nmailbox shortly, and please<br />\nfollow up with the candidates and<br />\nquestion them hard about their intentions. The Young Trustee-ship<br />\nis not the most visible of positions, but it has a wealth of unexplored potential.

The late<br />\nevening is the best time.<br />\nAnd now, a bit of philosophizing (you can stop here if you want<br />\nto). I want everyone to vote in the<br />\nprimary! Why? Well, as most of<br />\nyou have noticed, the political<br />\nclimate of the United States is<br />\ndominated by two major parties,<br />\nmaking other parties almost inconsequential. This situation has<br />\noften led individuals, usually in<br />\npseudo-intellectual coffee-table<br />\nconversation, to complain of the<br />\nrelative lack of choice we the<br />\ncitizens actually have in choosing<br />\nour leader. But. is this the case?<br />\nThe qualified answer is yes, we<br />\ndo not really have much of a<br />\nchoice come November. True,<br />\nthere are the Free Libertarians<br />\nand American Communists, and<br />\nthe ever-popular Socialist<br />\nWorkers, et al, but who really<br />\ngives them any chance? This<br />\nview, however, is only valid if<br />\nyou believe that the only vote that<br />\nmatters is a vote for a winner.<br />\nThat is decidedly not how<br />\ndemocracy should operate. A<br />\nvote should be a matter of conscience, not a matter of siding with<br />\na Goliath. It is easy to see how<br />\nthe latter attitude can lead to a<br />\nself-fulfilling prophecy, Biblical<br />\nallusions notwithstanding.<br />\nMore to the point is that we<br />\nAmericans have a considerable<br />\namount of leverage in deciding<br />\nwho will be on those top two<br />\ntickets in the first place. This is<br />\nthrough that spectacularly lengthy<br />\nhorse race going on as you read:<br />\nthe Presidential primaries. Here<br />\nwe have a choice of ten folks to<br />\ngive our trust to, representing as<br />\nwide a spectrum of mainstream<br />\nAmerican politics as we are likely to get. Does that sound like a<br />\nbackhanded compliment? Well, it<br />\nshould.<br />\nHere begins my answer for all<br />\nthe low voter turnout stories you<br />\nhave ever heard, and here the<br /><br />\n\u2022 \u2022 4 \u202224z.111,-,:rel-...4<br />\n.<br />\nf....5.14..2ger!if\"?<br /><br />\nissue relates to campus voting as<br />\nwell. The two general reasons<br />\ngiven for low voter turnout is that<br />\neither the voters are lazy and<br />\napathetic, or there are not any<br />\ncandidates worth voting for.<br />\nNow, as long as we cannot gauge<br />\nwhat is going on in the minds of<br />\nnon-voters, we can never know<br />\nthe answer to this question. But<br />\nI would urge everyone who feels<br />\nthat there are no candidates worthy of their vote to go to the polls<br />\nanyway and express this, by actively abstaining.<br />\nWhat good is this? Is this<br />\n\"throwing away your vote\"?<br />\nCertainly not. A passive abstention, sitting at home, may show<br />\neither dissatisfaction or apathy.<br />\nAn active abstention decidedly<br />\nshows dissatisfaction. If you're<br />\nfed up and not going to take it<br />\nanymore, and no one knows<br />\nabout it, that's no good. An official abstention shows your anger<br />\nand irritation: use it! Remember<br />\nthat a vote for a candidate reflects<br />\nyour trust in that candidate, tells<br />\nthe world that you sincerely<br />\nbelieve that he/she is a capable<br />\nperson for the job, not simply that<br />\neveryone else is worse. Abstaining is a very constructive way of<br />\nexpressing the sentiment that<br />\neveryone running is a loser (if<br />\nyou really think so, of course).<br />\nIt really is not as ridiculous as<br />\nit might sound. One need only<br />\nlook at the delegate totals of the<br />\ncurrent Democratic contenders to<br />\nsee the value of abstention.<br />\nSimon, Dukakis, and Gephardt<br />\nall have relatively the same<br />\nnumber of committed delegates,<br />\nabout 40-50 each; while there are<br />\nover 250 uncommitted delegates.<br />\nThe result: none of these guys<br />\nseems easily assured of the<br />\nnomination, and the Democratic<br />\nParty is doing some serious soulsearching.

I think I can<br />\ntake care of things that will not only pertain to a certain few students but will help<br />\nthe majority of the school. I can help most<br />\nstudents' stay at Hopkins a little bit better<br />\nby me being President of the Council.<br />\nN-L: As President, what would be<br />\nyour top priority?<br />\nI think my top priority, first of all, would<br />\nbe any immediate issues that come up that<br />\ndirectly affect the students. When there<br />\nwasn't a pressing issue, I would work on<br />\nplanning events which would keep the student body interested.<br />\nI think what Fitz [Student Council President Scott FitzGerald] started this year<br />\nwith Council, social programming and so<br />\nforth, is good because it serves as a foundation to get people involved in Council and<br />\nin the school. Once you get people out of<br />\ntheir rooms in the first place, then you can<br />\nbuild on that and build to bigger and better<br />\nthings, like community service and so forth.<br />\nHopkins is a very individualistic place,<br />\nnot just academic-wise but because you're<br />\nout on your own after freshman year. You<br />\nhave to do something to attract these people, to get them involved, [and] not just<br />\ntry to push programs on them so you end<br />\nup with total apathy.<br />\nN-L: What is the Council's purpose?<br />\nI think the purpose of Council is to work<br />\nfor the interests of the student body as a<br />\nwhole, to try to make student life here at<br />\nHopkins as good as it can be.<br />\nIf there's a problem academic-wise,<br />\nsocial-wise, we have to work on that and<br />\nwe have to try to improve things so that<br />\npeople can get the most that they can out<br />\nof their four years.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for an honor<br />\ncode? If so, what kind?<br />\nWell, we've already started up this year<br />\nthe Ad Hoc Committee for the Honor<br />\nCode, so when this committee comes forth<br />\nwith its proposal, which should be in a<br />\nweek or so, we're going to review that with<br />\nCouncil. If they come up with a proposal<br />\nwhich sounds feasible, I'll definitely push<br />\nfor it. An honor code's a good thing, but<br />\nit's not going to happen overnight.<br />\nIt works at other schools, but we haven't<br />\nhad it at Hopkins for a while. It's going<br />\nto take time to instill the idea of an honor<br />\ncode in the minds of the students. If we start<br />\nwith next year's freshman class, and they<br />\nhave no idea what to expect here, and if<br />\nwe start instilling that idea into them, then<br />\nfrom then on, the pieces can fall together.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report?<br />\nThe more activities you have to get a majority of the students together, that's going<br />\nto help relations among different types of<br />\nstudents, different people\u2014men, women,<br />\ndifferent races, and so forth. While you're<br />\nhere for four years, you're going to have<br />\ncontact with these people and you're going to have to get to know these people.<br />\nI'm going to try to have more of these<br />\nactivities such as Hoppy Hour and so forth<br />\nso you can see these people in a social atmosphere [other than class) and maybe<br />\nreduce some of the bias that some people<br />\nmay have had coming from different areas<br />\nof the country, different schools, and try<br />\nto build the character of a Hopkins student.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nIt's hard to pick out one certain issue.<br />\nMaybe sometimes Council could lean a little more toward the social programming<br />\nand not be all around academic and different aspects of the University. If you start<br />\nwith social programming and get more<br />\npeople involved, then you can start with<br />\nthat and work up to bigger and better<br />\nthings, such as foster better attitudes<br />\namong the students.<br /><br />\nyour top priority?<br />\nI have several top priorities. The two<br />\nmain ones are student service and social<br />\nprogramming. I think these are both very<br />\nimportant in order to make Hopkins a better community for the undergraduates<br />\nhere.<br />\nI also think that it's very important<br />\nto increase interaction between students<br />\nand the faculty or administration. I<br />\nthink that we should expand the studentfaculty interaction programs. It's important because I know there are always a<br />\nlot of people left out who want to do<br />\nit<br />\nN-L: What is the Council's purpose?<br />\nI see the Council's purpose on this campus as basically social programming and<br />\nstudent service. I think that we are not a<br />\nvery political council and I think, in ways<br />\nthat is good.<br />\nI do think that tolerance is important and<br />\nI feel that when people have political<br />\ngrievances they should be able to freely<br />\nvoice them. But the Council is basically to<br />\nserve students, and do the things they want<br />\nto do.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for a honor<br />\ncode? If so, what kind?<br />\nMy gut reaction to this is that I don't<br />\nthink that an honor code would work at<br />\nHopkins. I think that it's something that<br />\nshould be looked into. I think that the<br />\nstudents here are good and its not a slur<br />\non them or that I don't trust them, it's just<br />\na very, very competitive environment and<br />\nit would be very difficult to put an honor<br />\ncode into effect.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report?<br />\nIn terms of issues like a student union,<br />\nI think that is very important. It would<br />\nbe wonderful to have a place where<br />\nstudents could get together. especially<br />\nthe upperclassmen who live off campus,<br />\nto socialize with each other and do<br />\nactivities.<br />\nI think that the committee itself was a<br />\ngreat idea, and that it really served the<br />\ncommunity by looking into a lot of very<br />\nimportant issues for student welfare. The<br />\nrole of an ombudsmen is one that should<br />\nbe looked into, and would be very important and would serve student needs.<br />\nBut I also think that part of the role<br />\nof Council is for students to go to Council with these problems. and it is there<br />\nas a liaison between students and administrative and faculty problems. So I think<br />\nit would be important to delineate what<br />\nexactly the role of an ombudsman would<br />\nbe. That needs to be more specified.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nOverall I think that the Council has done<br />\na very good job this year with student services and sot ial programming.<br />\nOne thing that I think is important is<br />\naccessibility on the Council to student<br />\nneeds. Something that I would be interested in doing is possibly posting or<br />\npublishing the Council agenda before the<br />\nmeetings so that students would know what<br />\nwe are goinl, to be discussing before it<br />\ncomes out.<br />\nAs it is now I think that students don't<br />\neven have any idea what's going on until<br />\nthey read it after the fact in the News-Letter<br />\non Friday. One way to do this would be<br />\nto perhaps to maybe change the meetings<br />\nto Monday nights, and publish the agenda<br />\nFriday. or post it somewhere.<br />\nSo I think that accessibility is very important and that is something that needs to<br />\nbe looked into. We need to get more<br />\nstudents involved in the Council.<br /><br />\nPaul<br /><br />\nMichael<br /><br />\nDIAMOND<br />\nDIAMOND, from 16<br />\nly cannot say is one thing. [It would<br />\nbe to] take care of both the academic<br />\nquestions which the Student Council will<br />\nhandle and both the social questions.<br />\nAs president of the Student Council. I'm<br />\ngoing to have to work hard so that the<br />\nstudents aren't going to have to work hard<br />\nfor these things.<br />\nN-L: What is the Council's purpose?<br />\nGenerally the Council's purpose is<br />\nto work hard to take care of the problems of the students so that they, the<br />\nstudents, [who] don't have time to take<br />\ncare of these problems themselves,<br />\nso that they can go on with their lives.<br />\nOf course, we are going to welcome<br />\ninput from the students at all times.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for an honor<br />\ncode? if so, what kind?<br />\nI don't think that a specific honor code is the answer to the problem<br />\nof academic ethics in this school. However, I do think that a large responsibility for upholding academic ethics<br />\nlies in the professors' hands in the<br />\nclasses.<br />\nI know that I have seen in different<br />\nclasses, mainly during tests and exams,<br />\nthe proctoring is very lax. Of course,<br />\nthe students must participate also, we<br />\nmust encourage that. But I don't know<br />\nif the answer to that is a specific honor<br />\ncode.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force Report?<br />\nWell, I'm all for things like expanding<br />\nthe student union, things like that. Because<br />\nI know that our student union at this school<br />\nreally isn't the kind of place where people<br />\nwill congregate, to hang out and be with<br />\ntheir friends.<br />\nAlso, one of the great problems is that<br />\npeople, regardless whether they are living<br />\nclose to the campus, kind of view it<br />\nas a commuter school, they come to<br />\nthe school, they go to their classes, then<br />\nthey go home. Then, if they are doing any<br />\nother activities, it'll be off campus. There<br />\nis no sense of we are going to come to campus to have a good time,just to go to class.<br />\nN-L: So you would work to improve<br />\nthe student union?<br />\nSpecifically yes, and other things as<br />\nwell.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year? If so, how<br />\nmight you cover it?<br />\nI think there are certain issues such as<br />\ntuition hikes and divestment which really<br />\nneed to be covered a lot more.<br />\nN-L: How might you cover these<br />\nisues?<br />\nWell, on the most simple level, the<br />\nStudent Council will decide upon and<br />\nmake suggestions based on what they<br />\nfeel will be best for the students, and<br />\nwhat the students tell the Student Council what would be best for them.<br />\nI think that although the Student Council this year has addressed the issue<br />\nof creating a sense of participation among<br />\nthe students with the campus on campus, there is still a lot left to be done<br />\nand this is a major concern that we, I<br />\nwould have to deal with as Student Council president.<br /><br />\ndeveloped the idea of P.T. Flaggs' nights.<br />\nThat and my attitude would separate me<br />\nfrom the candidates, because I'm eager to<br />\nget started and revamp social<br />\nprogramming\u2014to get us more involved<br />\nand to stay involved.<br />\nN-L: As President, what would be<br />\nyour top priority?<br />\nI would have to say the interests of the<br />\nstudent body. They're going to vary for the<br />\nsocial interests. I'm going to have things<br />\nplanned for them every single weekend,<br />\nwithout exception. People won't be surprised to hear something's going on.<br />\nThere'll be another section of the student<br />\nbody that's interested in political issues,<br />\nand I have that background to inform the<br />\nstudent body on what's going on with the<br />\nstock portfolio. Then, we could talk about<br />\nthe chartering of the athletic clubs as well.<br />\nGetting in touch with the student body<br />\nis my top priority.<br />\nN-L: What is Council's purpose?<br />\nThe purpose of the Student Council is<br />\nto serve the student body and their interests, and that is my full intention\u2014to<br />\nserve the student body and to make sure<br />\ntheir views are heard and to represent their<br />\nideas and their attitudes.<br />\nAn example would be the tuition increases. The Student Council has been<br />\npushing a financial committee, and I'd like<br />\nto push that through and maintain it. One<br />\n,other thing is the add-drop dates. This<br />\nyear, I fought very hard for the students'<br />\ninterests because I knew they didn't want<br />\nto shorten the add-drop dates.<br />\nN-L: Would you push for an honor<br />\ncode? If so, what kind?<br />\nI would push for an honor code, but it<br />\nwouldn't be one to the extent of West<br />\nPoint. where the pressure is so great that<br />\nit detracts from the atmosphere.<br />\nIt would be more of a situation where<br />\nif it's apparent that there is a problem, then<br />\nmy advice for the students would be to actually take it to the professor and make him<br />\naware of it. If that doesn't work, it would<br />\nhave to be in steps.<br />\nN-L: How would you address some of<br />\nthe major issues in the Human Climate<br />\nTask Force report?<br />\nThe Human Climate Task Force dealt<br />\nwith a variety of issues, (like) the social<br />\natmosphere at Hopkins. I would make<br />\nclear to the Task Force\u2014it's an ongoing<br />\nprocess\u2014and to the student body that there<br />\nwould be a social programming overhaul.<br />\nThe quality of life here at Hopkins will<br />\nimprove as the attitudes of the students improve. If the attitides of the students are<br />\nnegative, then the quality of life is going<br />\nto point toward the negative side.<br />\nEveryone knows the difficulties involved: the study time, the hours of studying<br />\nyou have to put in, the stress that accompanies those hours.<br />\n(We need to) give the students a break.<br />\nIf they have a break, I think that quality<br />\nof life will follow: that as well as knowing that the school is involved with the<br />\ncommunity, is involved in looking out for<br />\ntheir interests, the Student Council's looking out for their interests.<br />\nN-L: Is there an issue that has not been<br />\ncovered adequately this year?

The Chapter<br />\nhas developed a mentoring program where seniors and recent<br />\nHopkins graduates can get career<br />\nhelp from alumni in their fields<br />\nof interest.<br />\nThe program is for those who<br />\nare planning to relocate and work<br />\nin the New York City area.<br />\nBeth Bernstein, director of this<br />\nprogram, explains that \"the mentoring program consists of a network of established alumni who<br />\nare willing to consult with interested students in a wide variety of fields.\" Although she stressed that this program \"is not a job<br />\nplacement service,\" she did explain that the alumni can give<br />\nvaluable advice to the student.<br />\nFor example, the alumni can<br />\ntell a student about a typical day<br /><br />\nat work, what background and<br />\ntraining programs are needed,<br />\nand even the type of employment<br />\navailable in the current job<br />\nmarket. In many cases the alumni can also set up interviews for<br />\ntheir \"mentees\". These interviews can be very important to<br />\none's career, as senior Jared<br />\nMintz knows.<br />\nMintz, an economics major,<br />\nhas taken advantage of this program and has had two interviews<br />\nat the Merrill Lynch World Headquarters because of it.

He<br />\nfeels that the program is well<br />\norganized and efficient. He also<br />\nbelieves that the program is successful because \"the mentors are<br />\nall volunteers and just as excited<br />\nas the students are.\"<br />\nThe mentoring process begins<br />\nwhen the student contacts Bernstein. She puts the name of the student and his or her career interests into her computer and tries<br />\nto match the student with a mentor/alumnus. After she finds a<br />\npositive match, she contacts the<br />\nalumni and informs them that<br />\nthey will be hearing from their<br />\n\"mentee\" in a few days. She then<br />\nmails the mentor's name, address, and phone number to the<br /><br />\nSusan Hoffman<br /><br />\nSenior Jared Mintz, who has taken advantage of the New York Alumni Chapter mentoring program to<br />\nsecure interviews at Merrill Lynch World Headquarters.<br />\nstudent and leaves the rest up to<br />\nthem. Usually the students have<br />\nan informal interview with their<br />\nmentors. This interview enables<br />\nthe mentor to get to know the student and the student's goals.<br />\nThe president of the New York<br />\nAlumni Chapter sent a letter to all<br />\nthe alumni in the area explaining<br />\nthe program. The response from<br />\nthe alumni was very positive. One<br />\nhundred and fifty alumni<br />\nresponded, and there are over sixty fields of interest now listed in<br />\nthe file. Bernstein commented<br />\nthat many students call and say<br /><br />\n\"You probably don't have<br />\nanyone in my field.<br />\nHowever, this is usually the case.<br />\nBernstein has also received<br />\nmany letters from alumni who<br />\nhave offered their services in<br />\nother ways, such as providing<br />\n\"familiarizing\" tours of New<br />\nYork City, housing information,<br />\nand even specific job offers,<br />\nwhich have been forward to the<br />\nHopkins Career Counseling<br />\nOffice.<br />\nAlthough this program, begun<br />\nlast fall, is relatively new, eleven<br />\npeople have been matched with<br /><br />\nmentors.

Numerous<br />\ncomplaints have caused students to seek other institutions around the city.<br /><br />\nDo you have a complaint about<br />\nFirst National Bank of Maryland?<br />\nSenior Dave Gitlitz and Junior<br />\nKen Kowalkowski do. Both<br />\nHopkins students say that they<br />\nhave lost money as a result of errors made by the bank's Gilman<br />\nHall branch.<br />\nGitlitz's main complaint is that<br />\nhe was charged for mistakes<br />\nmade by the bank. His problems<br />\nstarted when his bank statement<br />\nshowed an extra $300 in his account. He didn't spend the<br /><br />\nmoney but wrote a check that<br />\nwould have overdrawn his account by a few dollars without the<br />\nextra $300. According to Gitlitz,<br />\nthe bank discovered their error in<br />\ntime to cause his account to be<br />\noverdrawn. For this and the investigation into why the extra<br />\nmoney turned up in Gitlitz's account, he says, he was charged<br />\n$40.<br />\nAfter this situation had been<br />\ncleared, Gitlitz's monthly service<br />\ncharge was taken out early, causSee STUDENTS, 23<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/23<br /><br />\nStudents galled at Gilman branch<br />\nSTUDENTS, from 22<br />\ning him to accrue a negative<br />\nbalance and requiring him to pay<br />\nanother service charge of about<br />\n$20.

The money vanished<br />\nbetween the bank statements of<br />\nJune and July. It appeared back<br />\non the statement at the beginning<br />\nof August, Kowalkowski said.<br />\nWhen Kowalkowski tried to<br />\nfind out why this had happened,<br />\nhe felt that he was treated badly<br />\nby bank employees.

Born in 1898 in<br />\nEngland, the son of a miner,<br />\nMoore studied academic draftsmanship at the Royal College of<br />\nArt in London. He began<br />\nsculpting in the 1930's and<br />\nbecame a respected father-figure<br />\nfor many young artists. He is<br />\nknown to have had a kind and<br />\nrespectful demeanor with a very<br />\nstrong will. He always made his<br />\npoints in a very quiet yet forceful<br />\nway. Moore died in April of<br />\n1986.<br />\nThe Baltimore Museum of Art<br />\nis housing an exhibition of his<br />\nwork called Mother and Child,<br />\nthe Art of Henry Moore.<br />\nAlthough Moore spent years with<br />\nthe same subject, his work is<br />\nnever repetitive, never trivial.

The expression the mother's body gives off<br />\nis one of defensiveness and protection. The baby's shape is more<br />\nclearly stylized, and it retains its<br />\ndefinition. The deep tones of the<br />\nbronze further emphasize the<br />\npower and strength embodied in<br />\nthe sculpture.<br />\nMoore's work is essentially<br />\nabout the endurance of the human<br />\nbody, his figures being timeless<br /><br />\nand monumental in scale. There<br />\nis a dominance implied in his<br />\nfigures, yet the figures remain noble and dignified.<br />\nMoore's sculptures hark back<br />\nto the qualities that were attributed to the ancient Greek<br />\ngods: indescribable beauty,<br />\nawesome strength, and the power<br />\nof metamorphosis.

In the early sixties, Moore<br />\nmade some sculptures that combined an external with an internal form. Both are organic,<br />\nmolding themselves to each<br />\nother. The outer one is more<br />\ndominant, forming an enclosure<br />\nthat defines the inner shape. The<br />\ninner one has its own power,<br />\ntwisting and contorting within its<br />\nspace. They are interdependent<br />\nand relate entirely to each other.<br />\nIt is not surprizing, then, when<br />\none finds out that the sculpture is<br />\n\"Reclining Mother and Child\"<br />\n(1960). The delicate and intertwined balanced between the<br />\nvulnerable and the omnipotent<br />\nforms of mother and child is<br />\nevidenced even in Moore's less<br />\nabstract, later works. They simply could not function one without<br />\nthe other.<br />\nA large part of the exhibition<br />\nis taken over by Moore's drawings. He made these during wartime, when he lacked money for<br />\nmaterials for his sculptures, and<br />\nwhen his hands began to fail him.<br />\nThe drawings show great diversity in materials (lithographs,<br />\ncharcoal sketches, pastels, etc.)<br />\nand provide excellent insight into Moore's work. They show<br />\nscenes of mothers interacting with<br />\ntheir children. The edge is softer<br />\nhere, the women portrayed are as<br />\nprotective of their children as in<br />\nthe sculptures, yet they seem<br />\nmore vulnerable. The sculptures<br />\nseem to have pitted the mother<br />\nwith her child against the world,<br />\nand the mother stares out at the<br />\nviewer defiantly, ready to defend<br /><br />\nher child against the intruder. The<br />\ndrawings, in contrast, show the<br />\nwomen to be playing with and<br />\nholding their children. We seem<br />\nto have caught them in an intimate<br />\nmoment.<br />\nThe last room of the exhibition<br />\nshows some of Moore's earlier<br />\nwork. Here mother and child are<br />\nplaced in a more definite context:<br />\nwith a family, with furniture. The<br />\nother sculptures of this time<br />\nperiod are much more abstract<br />\nand seem too metaphorical and<br />\nimpersonal compared to the later<br />\nworks. Moore still seems to be<br />\nexperimenting with concepts<br />\nrather than form.<br />\nIn all of Moore's work there is<br />\nevidenced an organic, humanistic<br />\ntreatment of the body. His forms<br />\nare often compared to the surrealists', conjuring up images<br />\nfrom the unconscious. But his<br />\nfascination with the human body<br />\nand its outer manifestations<br />\nbetrays him to be grounded in the<br />\n'real'.<br />\nHenry Moore's work is not<br />\nshockingly or openly confrontational. It is easy to like, because<br />\nwe can relate to its themes. His<br />\nworks are sensual, soothing, and<br />\nemotional. The women he portrays are strong and dominant<br />\nwithout being overbearing. They<br />\ncommand our respect.<br />\nThe exhibit at the BMA does<br />\nMoore's work credit.

In<br />\nUnbearable Lightness we at last<br />\nhave a film free from cloying<br />\nadolescent sexuality, a film with<br />\na message that avoids didacticism, a film whose craft and art<br />\ncan be spoken of in the same<br />\nbreath as that of Fanny and Alexander. Indeed, Unbearable<br />\nLightness moves with the pleasingly straightforward grace, control, and style of a film which<br />\ntakes its subject matter seriously,<br />\nbut never heavyhandedly.

Here Kaufman, in collaboration with Jean-Claude Carrier, has written a script which<br />\nfollows Kundera's own advice to<br />\n\"eliminate and eliminate, \" a<br />\nscript that excises the book's<br />\nmore abstract philosophical concerns while focusing on the live<br />\ntriangle between Tomas (Daniel<br />\nDay Lewis), his wife Tereza<br />\n(Juliette Binoche), and Sabina<br />\n(Lena Olin).<br />\nAs the film opens, Tomas, an<br />\neminent brain surgeon, must<br />\ntravel to a small town to perform<br />\nemergency surgery. While there,<br />\nhe meets Tereza, an apparently<br />\nsimple woman who works as a<br />\nbarmaid at his hotel.

If anything,<br />\nsuch organizations probably accounted for the rapid rate of<br />\nassimilation of immigrants into<br />\nAmerican society, and such<br />\norganizations help maintain a link<br />\nwith the past. As cultural<br />\norganizations, there is nothing<br />\nwrong with the BSU or the Indian<br />\nStudents Organization or any<br />\nother group, so long as we realize<br />\nthe fact that as long as people<br />\nbelong to these groups, a complete homogeneous integration of<br />\nthese minorities into American<br />\nsociety cannot take place. Those<br />\nwho come from different backgrounds will always regard<br />\nmembers of such organizations as<br />\nThe Other, and will treat them<br />\nwith a certain air of suspicion.<br />\nThis, it would seem, is an<br />\nunavoidable human trait, and<br />\ndespite our best efforts, it is a fear<br />\nwe seem unable to control.<br />\nBecause this fear exists, however,<br />\ndoesn't mean we shouldn't have<br />\nBlack History month, for example. In fact, my only criticism of<br />\nBlack History Month is that the<br />\nmedia seemed to focus on making Black History Month important only to blacks, instead of attempting to show all of us the important contributions that have<br />\nbeen made by Black Americans.<br />\nWhich brings us, finally, to the<br />\npoint of this entire essay:<br />\nspecificially, that a certain<br />\namount of racial and ethnic<br />\nseparation does exist in the<br />\nUnited States, but the media is<br />\nserving to make it an even greater<br />\nand more unbreachable division.<br />\nAs a small example to be expounded upon, let us consider<br />\nsomething we see every day:<br />\ncommercials. When was the last<br />\ntime you saw a white guy in a<br />\nKing Cobra Malt Liquor commercial? A black guy in a Coors<br />\ncommercial? While it can be<br />\nargued that each of these companies is trying to sell to a specific<br />\ndemographic, the example serves<br />\nto point out that there seems to<br /><br />\nexist a notion that certain things<br />\nare for black people, and certain<br />\nthings for whites.<br />\nThis same attitude exists on a<br />\nmuch larger level. Consider radio<br />\nstations, for example. Radio stations that want to appeal to a<br />\nblack demographic generally play<br />\nfunk, R&amp;B,jazz, and rap, in any<br />\nnumber of permutations; radio<br />\nstations trying to reach a white<br />\naudience play Top 40, heavy<br />\nmetal, country, and so called<br />\n\"classic\" rock. Again, we can<br />\nsee how, in this case, station<br />\nmanagers have a preconceived<br />\nnotion of certain music being for<br />\nblacks, and certain music being<br />\nfor whites. It is an entirely constructed notion\u2014is their any<br />\nlogical reason, outside of our<br />\ncultural training, to assume that<br />\nblacks will dislike Mel Tillis, or<br />\nwhites Parliament/Funkadelic?<br />\nThis feeling even pervades the<br />\nmusic industry itself\u2014one of the<br />\ncriticisms leveled against the<br />\nBeastie Boys was that they were<br />\nwhite guys messing around in a<br />\n\"black\" medium. At the same<br />\ntime, an organization exists for<br />\nblack artists who are being ignored by the record industry<br />\nbecause they play heavy metal or<br />\njust plain top 40 rock and roll,<br />\nwhich are considered \"white\"<br />\nmedia. What difference, I ask<br />\nyou, does a man's skin color<br />\nmake in the way he plays a chord<br />\nprogression or sings a lyric?<br />\nFor the sake of brevity, and<br />\nbecause my knowledge in this<br />\nfield is strongest, I have stuck to<br />\nthe music industry, but I think<br />\nwith some research we would see<br />\nthe same type of preconceptions<br />\npermeating all the other forms of<br />\nmedia. What we have, essentially, is the continued promotion of<br />\nracial separation through the<br />\nmedia's notion of certain things<br />\nbeing \"for whites,\" and certain<br />\nthings being \"for blacks.\"<br />\nPerhaps the most irritating<br />\nthing about all this is that the<br />\nmedia could do something about<br />\nit, but seems intent on<br />\nperpetuating an intolerable situation. Take, for example, the<br />\ncritical acclaim that has been<br />\nheaped upon rap artists Public<br /><br />\nEnemy. The problem is that the<br />\ngroup, Chuck D and Flavor Flay<br />\nare promoting a vision of racial<br />\ndivision and urban terrorism.<br />\nTheir \"bodyguards\" even wear<br />\nammo and carry Uzis (although<br />\nthey claim they aren't loaded).<br />\nWhile their music is certainly<br />\noriginal, they deserve some kind<br />\nof censure for the fact that they<br />\nare promoting racial division and<br />\nviolence: which can only lead to<br />\nfurther distrust, fear, and separation. Here is a case where the<br />\nmedia needs to act in a more<br />\nresponsible fashion, and do<br />\nsomething to promote unity instead of division.<br />\nWhat, then, is the solution?<br />\nVery simple\u2014we need to stop letting the media decide for us what<br />\nour cultural perspectives are going to be. Furthermore, we have<br />\nto break out of the compartmentalization that we have all been<br />\ntaking part in, and get out to explore those things that are normally thought of as being beyond<br />\nour culturally defined tastes.<br />\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm<br />\ngoing to pop open a Schlitz and<br />\nlisten to some R&amp;B.<br /><br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nWhat, you may ask, do you do<br />\nwhen you're in the mood for<br />\nsomething a little more<br />\nsophisticated than Madonna,<br />\nsomething a little more mellow<br />\nthan Motley Crue?

In the former<br />\ncategory we have Nouveau Calls<br />\nfrom Wishbone Ash (a band<br />\nknown for its twin lead guitars),<br />\nand Guitar and Son from Pete<br />\nHaycock (formerly of the Climax<br />\nBlues Band). Wishbone Ash tends<br />\ntowards a more digital, layered<br />\nsound with overtones of funk and<br />\nclassical guitar, and, as a result,<br />\ntends to be a bit more subdued<br />\nthan Pete Haycock. As the title of<br />\nHaycock's album would seem to<br />\nindicate, the guitar is the central<br />\ncore of his music, with the rest<br />\nof the instrumentation being built<br />\naround it. Haycock's guitar style<br /><br />\nis flashier, almost in a heavy<br />\nmetal sense, yet it still manages<br />\nto integrate well with its surroundings and avoid overshadowing<br />\nthe other instruments.<br />\nFor those of you who prefer<br />\nyour music synthesized, we have<br />\nStewart<br />\nCopeland's<br />\nThe<br />\nEqualizer and Other Cliffhangers,as well as William Orbit's Strange Cargo. Copeland's<br />\nalbum, as you might guess, consists of the themes he has scored<br />\nfor the CBS television series The<br />\nEqualizer. In terms of that context, the music is quite good for<br />\nsetting up a visual sequence, but<br />\nin the purely aural context, it<br />\ntends to suffer a bit from the<br />\nlimitations imposed on it.<br />\nCopeland tends to rely a little too<br />\nheavily on such devices as the<br />\nswelling heroic crescendo, and<br />\nsome of the music comes off as<br />\nbeing a bit cliche. I still have to<br />\nadmit, however, that this is my<br />\nfavorite album in the series.<br />\nOrbit might be seen as a compromise between the almost pure<br />\nsynth style of Copeland and the<br />\nguitar style of Haycock. Orbit<br />\nwas formerly with a group called Torch Song, which turned out<br />\ntwo dance club hits before Orbit<br />\ndecided to go solo. This early experience can be heard in the way<br />\nOrbit lays down a very dense percussive track, then layers snatches of guitar, bass, and pure<br />\nsynth sound over top of it. Orbit<br />\nalso has a taste for Latin rhythms,<br />\nwhich lends an exotic flavor to<br />\nmany of these tracks. In his more<br />\nmellow moments, Orbit uses a<br />\nvery minimal style reminiscent of<br />\nPhilip Glass.<br />\nIn all, the No-Speak series provides a variety of styles for the<br />\nlistener in an attempt to reach out<br />\nto a more varied audience than<br />\nNew Age. It's intended for the<br />\ngrown-up rock and roller who<br />\nwants more from his music, but<br />\nstill wants a style that he can<br />\nrecognize and understand. That<br />\ndoesn't mean, however, that the<br />\nrest of us can't enjoy it too.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/29<br /><br />\nIS11) ooks<br /><br />\nThreat<br />\nby Dina Gan<br />\nI drop my napkin every time the<br />\nwaiter passes by.

I toss back the last swig of coffee, pressing my tongue flat near the<br />\nrim of the mug,flicking up the last<br />\ndrop.<br />\nI leave the cafe and run the two<br />\nblocks to the train station. The 3:05<br />\nfrom New York is on time and I<br />\nwait outside Gate E, watching<br />\npassengers file out. They all have<br />\nthe same flustered, searching expression that snaps into glad relief<br />\nwhen they find the mother or uncle or sister or lover that came to<br />\nmeet them. The bulk of the<br />\npassengers depart. A minute later<br />\ntwo businessmen wielding briefcases barrel through the doors. I ask<br />\nthe Red Cap attendant and he says<br />\nthat's everyone off the 3:05. I tour<br />\nthe station looking for Effy. I<br />\nwonder if she looks different and if<br />\nmaybe I didn't recognize her. She<br />\nprobably missed the train.<br />\nAnnoyed,I head home. The man<br />\nsitting next to me on the bus is<br />\nfinishing a bag of greasy french<br />\nfries. He wipes his fingers on the<br />\nseat and makes sucking noises with<br />\nhis tongue, trying to scrape off the<br />\npotato mush from his teeth. He<br />\nreaches up to his mouth with his index finger poised, but I jerk my<br />\nhead slightly toward him. His hand<br />\ngoes back down fast.

Nimrod's van,<br />\nwith the name of his old band The<br />\nFabulous Threat spray-painted on<br />\nthe side, is parked in front of my<br /><br />\napartment. I watch from across the<br />\nstreet.<br />\nThere is Effy.<br />\nShe walks like a man. She leans<br />\ninto her left side and takes uneven<br />\nstrides. Her bare calves are like the<br />\nwell-turned forelegs of an antique<br />\nwing chair, squat and solid, jutting<br />\nout from beneath the fringes of her<br />\nlong green suede jacket. The keys<br />\nare cupped in her left hand. she rattles them against her palm, like dice<br />\nbefore a throw. She steps carefully,<br />\nmissing all the cracks in the<br />\nsidewalk leading up to our front<br />\ndoor. Nimrod is right behind her,<br />\nstruggling with two grocery bags.<br />\nHis lanky, black-clad figure could<br />\nbe her shadow. Effy fingers the<br />\nkeys, grasps the right one and lets<br />\nthe others fall together on the ring.<br />\nThe door opens.<br />\nI cross the street and sit on the<br />\nvan bumper,staring at the sidewalk.<br />\nSome kid dropped his marbles when<br />\nthe cement was fresh and they are<br />\nembedded now like colored glass<br />\nislands in a hard gray sea. I step on<br />\nthem but they won't break. I go<br />\ninside.<br />\n\"There you are, Natalie,\" Effy<br />\nsays when she sees me at the kitchen door. \"I took an earlier train<br />\nand Nimrod picked me up at the station. I tried calling but there was<br />\nnobody here.\" Effy takes groceries<br />\nout of the bag and Nimord puts<br /><br />\nthem away. A liter of Diet Coke, a<br />\nbox of Sweet-n-Low, some cartons<br />\nof yogurt, and a few Weight Watchers frozen dinners pile on the<br />\ncounter. Effy has purchased two<br />\nbags of groceries containing virtually no caloric value.<br />\n\"I had something at the cafe<br />\nbefore going to meet you,\" I say.<br />\n\"That's why I wasn't here when you<br />\ncalled.\" I squeeze the kitchen<br />\ndoorknob hard, until I smell the<br />\nmixture of the brass and the sweat<br />\nfrom my palm.<br />\nEffy looks up and smiles briefly,<br /><br />\nthen starts folding the paper bags.<br />\nHer skin is much clearer than<br />\nbefore. The straggly split ends of<br />\nher hair have been trimmed. Her<br />\nlipstick is pale coral. Her nails are<br />\nuniform and polished. She might<br />\nnave just as well spent the four<br />\nweeks at a health spa than in a drug<br />\ndetoxification program.<br />\nNimrod stares at me. \"Natalie,\"<br />\nhe says. \"You haven't seen your<br />\nsister for a month. I think she could<br />\nuse a hug from you.\"<br />\nI release the doorknob and,Effy<br />\nsteps toward me. We embrace. \"I<br />\nmissed you,\" she says.<br />\nEffy had said she would miss me<br />\nfour weeks ago when she and<br />\nNimrod were leaving for their<br />\nweekend together in New York.<br />\nThe three of us stand on the curb<br />\nby the van early Friday morning. Effy is wired, not just from excitement. She is wearing her black<br />\nstillettos and half trips over her own<br />\nfeet while throwing her bags into<br />\nthe van. She squeals with laughter<br />\nat her clumsiness. She leans over to<br />\nme and says, \"Just remember one<br />\nthing while I'm gone. If you have<br />\nany guys over, don't screw them on<br />\nmy bed.\" She giggles again and skitters around to the passenger side,<br />\nhoisting herself into the front seat.<br />\nAmused, Nimrod grins and turns to<br />\nme. \"Here's something else to<br />\nremember,\" he whispers, pulling<br />\nme to him. He sticks his tongue on<br />\nthe side of my neck and drags it up<br />\nwetly over my ear the way a dog<br />\nwould. Nimrod bounds into the<br />\ndriver's seat and starts the engine.<br />\nThe van pulls away and Effy<br />\nscreams out of her rolled-down window, \"I'll miss you, Natalie.\" The<br />\nfinal \"e\" of my name trails into her<br />\nhigh-pitched squeal.<br />\nI get the call about Effy's overdose Sunday morning.

Well, no<br />\nother writer in this reviewer's experience has dovetailed exhaustive research and entertaining<br />\nanecdote with quite the level of<br />\nartifice demonstrated by Kenner<br />\nin this work.<br />\nA Sinking Island, as its title<br />\nmay suggest, chronicles the<br />\ndownward spiral and ultimate<br /><br />\ndemise (?) of Modern English<br />\nLiterature from 1895 to post<br />\nWorld War II.<br />\nAccording to Kenner, 1895<br />\nwas \"a year distinguished by<br />\nnothing in particular except its<br />\nplentitude of happenings:\"<br />\nIt was the year that ended the<br />\ndramatic careers of Oscar Wilde<br />\nand Henry James, and the literary<br />\ncareers of Thomas Hardy and<br />\nGeorge Meredith. It was also the<br />\nyear that began the careers of<br />\nH.G.

That was because<br />\nreaders needed something new to<br />\nread, every week, every day<br />\neven.\" As a result, Kenner explains, publishers with their<br />\nhungry presses, \"forever anxious<br />\nto recoup initial investments, pay<br />\noff creditors, use up reams of<br />\npaper, and keep pressmen<br />\nemployed,\" were continually<br />\nlooking for \"new stuff to print,<br />\nand books were soon getting written that, save for the press, would<br />\nnot have been written at all.\"<br />\nThe 'penny dreadfuls' of the<br />\nera were helping to wash over<br />\nclass distinctions as fast as the<br />\nVictorian elite were attempting to<br />\nshore them up.

I got her<br />\nsome beer and stuff to cheer her up<br />\nand we lay around in the van. She<br />\nwas really down about it. Then I fell<br />\nasleep and this morning I couldn't<br />\nwake her up. Oh God, she was so<br />\ndepressed last night. I had some<br />\nE.T. in my bag and she must have<br />\ndone all of it.

The play is about a<br />\nyoung woman, Barbara, who<br />\nbecomes a major in the Salvation<br />\nArmy while her father, the<br />\nbusinessman Undershaft, makes<br />\na fortune from munitions manufacturing. Through the paupers<br />\nwho attempt to wheedle as much<br />\nas possible from Barbara, he contrasts Undershaft's workers and<br />\ntheir toil, as well as the<br />\nreasonable manner in which<br />\nUndershaft treats them.<br />\nSome of GBS's detractors use his<br />\npersonal wealth, in large part a<br />\nconsequence of his playwriting as<br />\nwell as his wealthy wife, as an example of how Shaw grew out of<br />\ntouch with the working class and<br />\nthe goals of socialism.<br />\nFrom Shaw's point of view, the<br />\nopposite was true. In the preface<br />\nto Major Barbara, he pulls no<br />\npunches and maintains that,<br />\n\". . .our first duty, to which<br />\nevery other consideration should<br />\nbe sacrificed, is not to be poor.\"<br />\nBut the position of Undershaft as<br />\na somewhat sympathetic<br />\ncharacter is Shaw warning the<br />\nradicals that the workers want<br />\njobs and not revolution, as well<br />\nas the fact that they must deal<br />\nwith clever men like Undershaft<br />\nwho would provide the workers<br />\nwith what they want. Indeed.<br /><br />\nShaw is trying to draw the<br />\nradicals away from their idealistic<br />\nclouds down to a realistic<br />\nlevel where they can hope to<br />\nachieve their goals, which he still<br />\nshared: social and economic<br />\nequality. But the left must realize<br />\nthat there is a \"bodyguard of<br />\nlaborers whose immediate interests are bound up with those of<br />\nthe capitalists and who<br />\nare. . . more hardened against all<br />\nthe larger social considerations<br />\nthan their masters simply because<br />\nthey are more needy, ignorant<br />\nand irresponsible.\" He was further irritated by the socialist labor<br />\nparty, which attained power in<br />\nEngland in 1924, because they<br />\nfailed to articulate a practical<br />\nsocialist agenda despite their acceptance of the political process<br />\nas a means to their ends. Essentially, now they had power and<br />\nhad no idea what to do with it.<br />\nPower fascinated Shaw and he<br />\nenjoyed the high class hobnobbing which his position as a successful writer brought. But he<br />\ndidn't lose the point of view that<br />\nthe value in steadily improving<br />\nthe working class' lot through<br />\neducation, social insurance<br />\nschemes and nationalized industry lay in that it would eventually displace the upper classes,<br />\nprovided the Fabians stressed the<br />\nidea of social and economic<br />\nequaltiy all the way through.

Drachman has also<br />\nrecently published a book which<br />\nstudies the history of the Hospital<br />\nand how it related to the professional and social lives of the<br />\nwomen that worked under its<br />\nroof. Identifying the N.E.<br />\nHospital for Women as a<br />\nmicrocosm for the changes that<br />\naffected women for the last 150<br />\nyears, Drachman interweaved the<br />\nhistory of the institution and the<br />\nconcurrent advances women<br />\nmade in their fields spanning the<br />\ntime between the antebellum<br />\nyears and the late sixties.

A year later, less media attention, a number of complaining<br />\nathletes, Hopkins is without a formal drug and alcohol education<br />\nprogram for athletes. It seems as<br />\nif a traumatic situation must occur to bring about a reaction.<br />\nThat's part of the picture that<br />\nI saw way back in October when<br />\nI first began asking questions<br />\nabout why the program was dropped and whether there were any<br />\nplans to replace the program.<br />\nMiscommunication, misunderstanding, many months, student<br />\ncouncil intervention .. . I'm<br />\nwriting this to clarify a few<br />\npoints.<br />\nThe first reaction that I received from Mr. Scott, the Athletic<br />\nDirector, and Dean Colombo was<br />\nthat Drug and Alcohol Awareness<br />\nand Education should be a campus wide issue. Pursuit of a mandatory program for athletes was<br />\nbiased and unfair.<br />\nAt that time and many times<br />\nfollowing, I have stated that Drug<br />\nand Alcohol Awareness/Education should be a campus-wide effort. In no way have I singled the<br />\nathletes out\u2014they are one of<br />\nmany groups which may be addressed. To quote myself, \"it's<br />\na multiple front problem and this<br />\nis one front.\"<br />\nEven with such statements, I<br />\nwas/am still misunderstood. The<br />\nissue was taken to student council a few weeks ago. The publicity that lively council meeting<br />\ngenerated got some reaction. Mr.<br />\nBob Scott, Scott FitzGerald (Stu-<br /><br />\ndent Council President), Ty<br />\nHyderdally (council member in<br />\ncharge of the Athletic Committee), and I ni,. Dean Colombo's office last Friday afternoon<br />\nwith the hope of clearing up some<br />\nmisunderstandings.<br />\nAt the beginning of the<br />\nmeeting, it was made clear once<br />\nagain that no team or individual<br />\nwas being accused of anything,<br />\nnor were the athletes being<br />\nsingled out.<br />\nMr. Scott then explained that<br />\nmost coaches usually mention<br />\nsomething about drugs and<br />\nalcohol at the beginning of each<br />\nseason.<br />\nQuestions quickly followed.<br />\nWere all the teams getting this<br />\ntreatment? Were the coaches<br />\nqualified to provide the necessary<br />\ninformation? . . .to recognize the<br />\nsigns?<br />\nThe conversation, which at<br />\ntimes became heated, bounced<br />\nback and forth. This is no place<br />\nto repeat verbatim what was said.<br />\nAll the participants in the meeting<br />\nwere concerned with helping the<br />\nstudent body. Hopkins is fortunate to have an excellent<br />\nAthletic Program run by some<br />\nvery qualified people. Being<br />\nqualified, being an adult, doesn't<br />\nnecessarily mean that education<br />\nand awareness don't need to<br />\nbe/shouldn't be heightened. I<br />\nthink this was the understanding<br />\nreached at the conclusion of the<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nResults? Dean Colombo has<br />\npromised that Mr. Scott will reevaluate the coaches\u2014both fulland part-time coaches. \"Mr.<br />\nScott will hold conversation with<br />\nthe coaches and make the assessment whether more training is<br />\nneeded,\" explained Colombo,<br />\nwhile stressing that students must<br />\nalso participate in the awareness<br /><br />\nand education effort.<br />\nMr. Scott, after hearing the<br />\npositive response a speaker like<br />\nMike Green has had speaking on<br />\nalcohol, has agreed to try such a<br />\nprogram next year with the<br />\nathletes before the beginning of<br />\ntheir respective seasons. One of<br />\nMr. Scott's biggest objections to<br />\nsuch speaker programs had been<br />\nthe negative feedback received<br />\nfrom attending students in the<br />\npast.<br />\nThat's where matters stand for<br />\nnow . . .<br />\nI've been approached by<br />\nathletes who have gone on to tell<br />\nme how useless a drug and<br />\nalcohol awareness program<br />\nwould be. They've heard it all<br />\nbefore; besides, they are adults<br />\nnow so they can't be forced to do<br />\nanything. Such programs would<br />\nbe a waste of time and effort.<br />\nMy reaction. . . I've heard<br />\nthings when I was 10, heard the<br />\nsame things when I was 15, 20,<br />\n21\u2014each time I get something<br />\nnew out of it. At the very least<br />\nthere is some reinforcement.<br />\nAs for the adult part. . . Seems<br />\nto me that part of the definition<br />\nwould include something about an<br />\nawareness of when listening may<br />\nbe important/appropriate.

Sean Bramble<br />\nWelcome back to the Wide<br />\nWorld of Sports Predictions,<br />\nwhere the only requirements are<br />\nlong explanations of your gutsy<br />\nguesses and your reading public<br />\nhaving a short memory. So,<br />\nwithout further ado, I'll continue<br />\nto offer my evaluation of the<br />\nAmerican League Worst.<br />\nI) Kansas City Royals. A<br />\npolished, veteran team, with<br />\nenough young spark (Seitzer,<br />\nStillwell) to keep them going. The<br />\namazing thing about the Royals<br />\nlast year was that they were<br />\nshutout so many times despite<br />\nhaving an offensive nucleus of<br />\nBrett, Seitzer (.323), Tartabull<br />\n(101 RBI's), Balboni (24 HR), and<br />\nJackson (22 HR). Even the<br />\nsecond baseman, Frank White, hit<br />\n17 homers. Granted, Balboni .is<br />\ngone, but with that kind of power<br />\ncore and with John Wathan emphasizing more speed (he holds<br />\nthe record for stolen bases by a<br />\ncatcher-32), I don't think the<br />\nRoyals are going to have trouble<br /><br />\nscoring runs this year. And the<br />\nstaff? Don't you think the Twins<br />\nwould like to have Bannister,<br />\nLeibrandt, Saberhagen, Gubicza,<br />\nBlack, and Quisenberry. Simply<br />\nstupendous.<br />\n2) Oakland A's. When Jerry<br />\nLee Lewis said, \"Whole Lotta<br />\nShakin' Going On,\" I believe he<br />\nhad the A's in mind. Eighteen<br />\nbodies have either left or joined<br />\nthe A's since last year. Tony<br />\nLaRussa, a fine manager, has<br />\nbeen given the task of molding the<br />\nlikes of McGwire, Canseco,<br />\nLansford, Parker, and Baylor into<br />\na lineup that resembles<br />\nMurderer's Row. I think he'll<br />\nsucceed, but what about the double play combo? And is Dennis<br />\nEckersley really a relief ace at<br />\nthis stage of his career? If<br />\nanything, I think I've picked these<br />\nguys too high.<br />\n3) Minnesota Twins. They<br />\nreally aren't that bad. If anything,<br />\nthey've got a better chance to<br />\nrepeat than their World Series opponent does. But to expect Viola<br />\nand Blyleven to carry the staff is<br /><br />\njust a bit unrealistic.<br />\n4) California Angels. In just<br />\nover a year, the Angels have<br />\ncompleted a facelift. Compared to<br />\ntheir team of 1986, the 1988<br />\nAngels have improved agewise at<br />\n2B, 3B, LF, CF, and DH. Now,<br />\nif Kirk McCaskill comes back<br />\nfrom arm surgery, the Angels<br />\nwill be able to field a staff comparable to the Twins'.<br />\n5) Texas Rangers. \"Flirting<br />\nwith Disaster\"\u2014Molly Hatchet... God, I've got to get off<br />\nthis song kick. Anyway, I will say<br />\nI have a low opinion of a team<br />\nwhen it benches Oddibe<br />\nMcDowell, when it antagonizes<br />\ntheir budding superstar, Ruben<br />\nSierra, and when it doesn't bother<br />\ncoming up with another starting<br />\npitcher. I used to think a lot of the<br />\nRangers, but I'm starting to<br />\nwonder now.<br />\n6) Seattle Mariners.

The Jays<br />\nracked up 27 bout wins in sabre,<br />\n27 in epee, and 24 in foil to wind<br />\nup on top of the 14-team league<br />\nby the slim margin of 2 bouts<br />\nover host and runner-up Vassar<br />\nCollege.<br />\nThe championship is fenced on<br />\n9 strips simultaneously, 3 roundrobin pools per weapon. In foil,<br />\nsenior<br />\nco-captain<br />\nChai<br />\nKulsakdinun, battling the flu as<br />\nwell as his opponents on the 'A'<br />\nstrip, nevertheless finished with<br />\na 6/6 record which included<br />\nseveral 5-4 losses and just missed qualifying for the final. On the<br />\n'B' strip, junior Dave Cohen<br />\nfenced very well as he advanced<br />\nto the final with an 11/1 slate,<br />\nwhile on the 'C' strip, freshman<br />\nJason Riffaterre showboated at<br />\nthe wrong times and wound up<br />\nwith 7 wins in 12 tries. All three<br />\nmen fenced creditably but, with<br />\nthe exception of Cohen, did not<br />\nshow the intensity which in dual<br />\nmeets had enabled them to beat<br />\nevery other foil team in the conference. Here they finished 3rd as<br />\na unit behind Army and Vassar,<br />\nwhich won the foil team trophy<br />\nby 4 bouts over the Jays.<br />\nThe sabremen fared better,<br />\nfinishing 2nd as a team behind<br />\nRutgers-Newark. Senior cocaptain Mark Drasnin fenced to<br />\nan excellent 10/2 record on the<br />\n'A' strip as he beat the<br />\neventual champion handily and<br />\nqualified for the final. The<br />\nsabremen accomplished at least<br />\none of their goals by beating<br />\nSeton Hall, the only team to upend them in the dual meet season.<br />\nSophomore Andrew Jablonowski<br />\nalso fenced very well on the 'C'<br />\nstrip, qualifying for the final with<br />\n10/2 log. On the 'B' strip,<br />\nhowever, sophomore teammate<br />\nTom Cantilina was the<br />\nvictim of inconsistent officiating<br />\nas he wound up on the wrong side<br />\nof three 5-4 losses. Nevertheless,<br />\nhe held up his end with a 7/5 slate<br />\nand just missed the final.<br />\nEpee was another story. Starting the season as the weakest of<br />\nthe Jays' three weapons, the three<br />\nmen (freshmen Ian Held, 9/3 on<br />\nthe 'A' strip; senior Dale Bell,<br />\n7/5 in the 'B' pool; and junior<br />\nBob Lee, 11/1 in the 'C' pool)<br />\nhad progressed well over the<br />\nseason, losing only to VPI in dual<br /><br />\nmeets. However, in this event<br />\nthey were not to be denied and<br />\nwound up tied with W &amp; M for<br />\nthe epee team trophy with 27 bout<br />\nwins as both Held and Lee<br />\nqualified for the final.<br />\nThe top fencers from each strip<br />\nqualify for the 9-man individual<br />\nfinal, 4 from the 'A' pool, 3 from<br />\nthe 'B', and two from the 'C'<br />\npool in each weapon.

Nevertheless, having won the overall<br />\nteam crown seemed to take most<br />\nof the wind out of the Jays' sails;<br />\nexcept for Held, who finished 4th<br />\nin epee, the spark was just not<br />\nthere. In sabre, Drasnin and<br />\nJablonowski wound up 5th and<br />\n6th respectively; in foil, Cohen<br />\ntook 6th, while in epee Lee<br />\nfinished 9th. Nevertheless 4 of<br />\nthe 5 finalists (Cohen, Held,<br />\nDrasnin, and Jablonowski) placed 6th or higher which, together<br />\nwith their high finish in dual meet<br />\nstats, was enough to garner them<br />\nAll-Conference recognition for<br />\nseason-long excellence.<br />\nCoach Dick Oles was both<br />\npleased and slightly unhappy.<br />\n\"Anytime you're on top of the<br />\npile\u2014and for as long as we<br />\nhave\u2014you've got to expect<br />\neverybody to be gunning for<br />\nyou,\" the Jay leader commented.<br />\n\"Ever see a shark-feeding frenzy?

The Blue Jays also<br />\nwon the Middle Atlantic Conference Southeast League for the<br />\nsecond straight year before losing<br />\nthe overall South championship to<br />\nGettysburg.<br />\nThe biggest problem of the<br />\n1987 Blue Jays was pitching.

Drachman peppered these successes with some<br />\nother interesting information<br />\nabout the physicians in the<br />\nwomen's hospitals and got a few<br />\ngasps and comments from the audience. First, the women doctors<br />\nwere generally unmarried, the<br />\nage frowning upon women raising a family and leading a professional life simultaneously. Nurses<br />\nwere apparently treated even just<br />\nas badly in the women's hospitals<br />\nas in the men's, their jobs basically comprising \"menial and<br />\nhousehold work with few<br />\nresponsibilities.\"<br />\nThe days of separation did not<br />\nlast long, however, as signs of integration began appearing in the<br />\nearly twentieth century with the<br />\nadmission of female medical<br />\nstudents to some of the nation's<br />\ntop schools and the ever-opening<br />\ndoors to women in internships<br />\nand residencies, especially in the<br />\nlarge urban centers. The N.E.<br />\nHospital and the N.Y. Infirmary<br />\ncontinued to train female physicians exclusively, claiming that<br />\ntheir institutions \"provided the<br />\nbest training for women for their<br />\nfuture practices.\" As science progressed and the old ideas among<br />\nleaders in medicine turned to a<br />\nmore \"empirical, objective, and<br />\nreductionist\" way of thought, the<br />\ncontributions of doctors began to<br />\nNOTES, from 36<br />\nAPTT Counselors: Consultation sections meet this week Sunday at 500 in<br />\nthe White House Conference Room;<br />\nTuesday at 12:00 in Conference Room<br />\nB; and Thursday at 1:00 in Gilman 42.<br />\nIf you have any problems or questions,<br />\ncall Vicki.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Jewish League<br />\npresents \"The Russian Connection\",<br />\na film covering the links between the<br />\nSoviet Union, the PLO and world terrorism.

In the early<br />\ntwentieth century, the typicallymale medical institutions and<br />\nfraternities began to open their<br />\ndoors to women for much the<br />\nsame reason. Most notably, the<br />\nAMA began accepting women as<br />\nmembers in 1908 to provide all<br />\nphysicians an opportunity to advance the field for the benefit of<br />\nall.<br />\nThe final chapter in the history<br />\nof the female doctor was written<br />\nrelatively recently, the most far<br />\nreaching advances occuring in the<br />\nlast 40 years. World War II was<br />\nan important turning point for the<br />\nfemale physicians as the shortage<br />\nof young men in the country<br />\nmade it necessary to offer the internship and residency positions<br />\nof the nation's hospitals to<br />\nwomen. In a tell-tale statistic cited<br />\nby Drachman, in 1941, 105<br />\nhospitals in the U.S. accepted<br />\nwomen for residencies. One year<br />\nlater, the number jumped to 358<br />\nand gradual gains were continued<br />\nthroughout the war and into the<br />\npost war period. By the 1950's<br />\nthe integration process of women<br />\nwas well underway and the<br />\nwomen's hospitals began waning<br />\nin importance and many felt that<br />\nthey had become obsolete. Symbolic of this period of integration<br />\nwas the acceptance of male physicians on staff at the N.Y. Infirmary in the 1960's and the<br />\nwithdrawel of considerable financial support from a principal<br />\nbenefactor of the N.E. Hospital<br />\nfor Women.<br />\nApart from this excellent<br />\nhistorical summary, several other<br />\nimportant issues that face female<br />\nphysicians today were referred to<br />\nin Drachman's talk as well as<br />\nbrought up by the audience in the<br />\ndiscussion following the lecture.<br />\nPrincipal among these were the<br />\nFrom March 1-31, the Office of Student<br />\nFinancial Services will be closed Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, 1-5 p.m., in order to review<br />\nfreshman files.

A<br />\nHopkins physician rose soon after<br />\nthe close of Drachman's talk to<br />\nreport that he is the son of a practicing female physician, and he<br />\nthought that \"I turned out to be<br />\na little better than retarded,\" to<br />\nwhich the audience cheered. On<br />\nthe subject of the dominance of<br />\none sex in certain specialties,<br />\nDrachman admitted that the situation currently is one where<br />\nwomen seem concentrated in certain fields, but she felt that the opportunities open to women today<br />\nwere extremely vast, exciting and<br />\nrewarding.<br />\nThe third lecture in the Hospital<br />\nas a Human Institution Series will<br />\nhe \"The Ospedale Maggiore in<br />\nMilan: A 15th Century Ideal<br />\nHospital\" to be given by Dr.<br />\nEgon Verheyen, formerly Professor of Art History at Johns<br />\nHopkins and currently the<br />\nClarence J.

All MA<br />\nresources (though dwindling due<br />\nto certain hoops referees and<br />\nmissing lacrosse equipment) will<br />\nbe thrown into the campaign to<br />\nelect Robert Dole. If you are asking why, the newly appointed<br />\nBIA political advisor Eric \"Buttsteak\" Pifer tells it this way:<br />\n\"The deciding factor was<br />\ndefinitely the canned crushed<br />\npineapple. It goes well in salads,<br />\nsoups, or in your favorite lethal<br />\npunch.
