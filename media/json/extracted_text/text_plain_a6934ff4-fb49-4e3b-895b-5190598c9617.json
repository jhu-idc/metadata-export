Last year alone, it<br />\nlost something near $80,000. It has been<br />\nnoted, though, in recent meetings of the<br />\nbookstore committee, that bad management<br />\nand unwieldy inventory--not theft--have been<br />\nthe major factors in the bookstore's financial<br />\nwoes. The bookstore committee was advised<br />\nby the Business Service division that a<br />\ncontract operation would be the most sound<br />\neconomic solution to the problem. This may<br />\nbe so, but there are many other considerations involved as well.<br />\nWhat the contractor, Barnes and Noble,<br />\nproposes is extensively promoting soft<br />\ngoods. In other words, Hopkins will get a<br />\ncheaper T-shirt, but the quality of the books<br />\nin the bookstore will go down. The emphasis<br />\nwill be on cheap merchandising rather than<br />\nintellectual fare. The alternative to this is<br />\nbetter management, more sensible reduction of impossible inventory, hence better<br />\nbooks, and even a break-even proposition for<br />\nthe University.<br />\nIn a recent meeting of the bookstore<br />\ncommittee, the financial report for fiscal<br />\n1969-70 was given to the committee. Among<br />\nthe items was a budgeted $16,000 for interest<br />\non working capital--in other words, the in.terest paid on inventory not yet sold. According to a survey done by the Peat Marwick Corp., the bookstore's inventory was<br />\nunwieldy for the size of the University. To<br />\nthis date, the inventory has not effectively<br />\nbeen reduced.<br />\nThe committee also heard a report from<br />\nthe Business Services division on the<br />\nfeasibility of a contract operation. The<br />\nrecommendation was put forth that Barnes<br />\nand Noble be employed immediately. B and<br />\nN said it would pay the University $50,000 per<br />\nyear. Barnes and Noble proposed to substantially increase soft goods, and radically<br />\ncut the inventory of books in the store. It was<br />\nalso learned that until 1967, the year that the<br />\nbookstore was moved to its present location,<br />\nthe University set up the budget so that it<br />\nwould make a net profit of 6 per cent a year,<br />\nwhich was made yearly. The University<br />\n<br />\neliminated that practice because of student<br />\nSo what the<br />\ncharges of profiteering.<br />\nUniversity plans to do is to return to this<br />\npolicy that it abandoned nearly 4 years ago.<br />\nTo add to this, the University won't even see<br />\nthe profit.<br />\nAccording to the contract, the University<br />\nmust pay for plant operation, security and<br />\nUniversity phone service. It must also<br />\ncontinue to pay for the construction cost<br />\nincurred when the bookstore moved to its<br />\npresent location. So, the $50,000 that the<br />\ncompany will pay Hopkins will be spent on<br />\noperation of the bookstore_ physically.<br />\nBarnes and Noble's approach is simple.<br />\nThey will reduce the inventory, and they will<br />\nhighly emphasize soft goods and used books.<br />\nThey plan to buy back books from students at<br />\n25 or 50 per cent of cost and sell them back at<br />\n75 per cent of cost. They also plan to merchandise the items in such a way that if they<br />\nare not bought within a month, they will be<br />\nsent back to the publisher. That means that<br />\nthere will be almost no tradebooks actually<br />\navailable. Rather a few will be available for<br />\na short time only. It means that we will have<br />\na Woolworth's instead of a bookstore.<br />\nThe Press<br />\nAnother factor involved in the possible<br />\ncontract operation's limitation on<br />\ntradebooks is that many professors and grad<br />\nstudents use the JHU Press to publish their<br />\nwork. The major outlet of the press is the<br />\nbookstore. So, these operations might be<br />\ncurtailed significantly as well.<br />\nThe two obvious problems are inventory<br />\nand management. We need a better business<br />\nmanager to run the bookstore, and we need<br />\nthe inventory cut drastically. This could be<br />\ndone without a contract operation. Better<br />\ncontrol over situations such as these lie in<br />\nmore meetings of the bookstore committee,<br />\nwhich at present meets regularly only twice<br />\na year. In a recent meeting, Dr. Roger Horn,<br />\nMathematics, complained that increased<br />\nmeetings would be tantamount to operation<br />\nof the bookstore by committee, and said,<br />\n\"We don't know how to run a bookstore.\"<br />\nDr. Horn also objected on the grounds that<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br />\n<br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nListen Mack<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI see that Mack I'mthinking-of-quitting Lee and<br />\nhis accessories in the Student<br />\nCouncil are planning on doing<br />\ntwo things: 1) Suing the<br />\nUniversity and 2) not paying<br />\nthe tuition increase.

Last year alone, it<br />\nlost something near $80,000. It has been<br />\nnoted, though, in recent meetings of the<br />\nbookstore committee, that bad management<br />\nand unwieldy inventory--not theft--have been<br />\nthe major factors in the bookstore's financial<br />\nwoes. The bookstore committee was advised<br />\nby the Business Service division that a<br />\ncontract operation would be the most sound<br />\neconomic solution to the problem. This may<br />\nbe so, but there are many other considerations involved as well.<br />\nWhat the contractor, Barnes and Noble,<br />\nproposes is extensively promoting soft<br />\ngoods. In other words, Hopkins will get a<br />\ncheaper T-shirt, but the quality of the books<br />\nin the bookstore will go down. The emphasis<br />\nwill be on cheap merchandising rather than<br />\nintellectual fare. The alternative to this is<br />\nbetter management, more sensible reduction of impossible inventory, hence better<br />\nbooks, and even a break-even proposition for<br />\nthe University.<br />\nIn a recent meeting of the bookstore<br />\ncommittee, the financial report for fiscal<br />\n1969-70 was given to the committee. Among<br />\nthe items was a budgeted $16,000 for interest<br />\non working capital--in other words, the in.terest paid on inventory not yet sold. According to a survey done by the Peat Marwick Corp., the bookstore's inventory was<br />\nunwieldy for the size of the University. To<br />\nthis date, the inventory has not effectively<br />\nbeen reduced.<br />\nThe committee also heard a report from<br />\nthe Business Services division on the<br />\nfeasibility of a contract operation. The<br />\nrecommendation was put forth that Barnes<br />\nand Noble be employed immediately. B and<br />\nN said it would pay the University $50,000 per<br />\nyear. Barnes and Noble proposed to substantially increase soft goods, and radically<br />\ncut the inventory of books in the store. It was<br />\nalso learned that until 1967, the year that the<br />\nbookstore was moved to its present location,<br />\nthe University set up the budget so that it<br />\nwould make a net profit of 6 per cent a year,<br />\nwhich was made yearly. The University<br /><br />\neliminated that practice because of student<br />\nSo what the<br />\ncharges of profiteering.<br />\nUniversity plans to do is to return to this<br />\npolicy that it abandoned nearly 4 years ago.<br />\nTo add to this, the University won't even see<br />\nthe profit.<br />\nAccording to the contract, the University<br />\nmust pay for plant operation, security and<br />\nUniversity phone service. It must also<br />\ncontinue to pay for the construction cost<br />\nincurred when the bookstore moved to its<br />\npresent location. So, the $50,000 that the<br />\ncompany will pay Hopkins will be spent on<br />\noperation of the bookstore_ physically.<br />\nBarnes and Noble's approach is simple.<br />\nThey will reduce the inventory, and they will<br />\nhighly emphasize soft goods and used books.<br />\nThey plan to buy back books from students at<br />\n25 or 50 per cent of cost and sell them back at<br />\n75 per cent of cost. They also plan to merchandise the items in such a way that if they<br />\nare not bought within a month, they will be<br />\nsent back to the publisher. That means that<br />\nthere will be almost no tradebooks actually<br />\navailable. Rather a few will be available for<br />\na short time only. It means that we will have<br />\na Woolworth's instead of a bookstore.<br />\nThe Press<br />\nAnother factor involved in the possible<br />\ncontract operation's limitation on<br />\ntradebooks is that many professors and grad<br />\nstudents use the JHU Press to publish their<br />\nwork. The major outlet of the press is the<br />\nbookstore. So, these operations might be<br />\ncurtailed significantly as well.<br />\nThe two obvious problems are inventory<br />\nand management. We need a better business<br />\nmanager to run the bookstore, and we need<br />\nthe inventory cut drastically. This could be<br />\ndone without a contract operation. Better<br />\ncontrol over situations such as these lie in<br />\nmore meetings of the bookstore committee,<br />\nwhich at present meets regularly only twice<br />\na year. In a recent meeting, Dr. Roger Horn,<br />\nMathematics, complained that increased<br />\nmeetings would be tantamount to operation<br />\nof the bookstore by committee, and said,<br />\n\"We don't know how to run a bookstore.\"<br />\nDr. Horn also objected on the grounds that<br />\n(continued on page 8)<br /><br />\nLetters to the Editors<br />\nListen Mack<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI see that Mack I'mthinking-of-quitting Lee and<br />\nhis accessories in the Student<br />\nCouncil are planning on doing<br />\ntwo things: 1) Suing the<br />\nUniversity and 2) not paying<br />\nthe tuition increase. Very<br />\nfunny. Mack Lee is complaining about Hopkins<br />\n\"violating an implicit contract with its students by<br />\nproviding poor education at<br />\nspiraling tuition costs.\" Well,<br />\nthat happens to be opinion,<br />\nnot legal fact. All Mack Lee<br />\ncan really judge on are the<br />\ncourses he's taken. Furthermore, if he hates it here<br />\nso much, why didn't he<br />\ntransfer, and why doesn't he<br />\nnow? I'd also like to know<br />\nwhere the $35 an hour for the<br />\nlegal brief is coming from-the<br />\nActivity Fee we, the<br />\nunrepresented students paid,<br />\nor the money the University<br />\nthey're suing allots them<br />\nannually. An accounting of<br />\nwhat the S.C. does with our<br />\nmoney is long overdue,<br />\nanyway.<br /><br />\nWhat would really be<br />\nfunny, though, is what would<br />\nhappen if the S.C. and its<br />\nfollowers refused to pay the<br />\ntuition increase. They'd get<br />\nthe same treatment as<br />\nanyone else pulling the same<br />\nstunt-expulsion from Hopkins. Come to think of it,<br />\nnow I really hope they go<br />\nthrough with the plan.<br />\nNot that many students<br />\nwould join them, though.<br />\nSome students who were<br />\nrather ambivalent about the<br />\nGovernance Proposal voted<br />\nfor it when the S.C. and the<br />\nNews-Letter opposed it. The<br />\nworst indictment against the<br />\nS.C., though, is the miniscule<br />\nnumber of students showing<br />\nup at the Undergrad<br />\nHearings. It just goes to show<br />\nhow much faith we have in a<br />\nbiased clique which has not<br />\neven tried to do anything<br />\nconstructive for us, or the<br />\nUniversity as a whole.<br />\nWales Nematollahii<br />\nFan of Fans<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI am new at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nI came in August to coach the<br /><br />\nvarsity basketball team.

(The first loneliest man of course is the campus<br />\nbarber. And small wonder. The last time any undergrad got his hair<br />\ncut was during the tragic dandruff epidemic of 1963. Since then campus<br />\nbarbers have had nothing to do except sit around the shop and wait for<br />\nthe new Playboy. Many of them, in fact, are giving up barbering to go<br />\ninto the teaching game. Take, for instance, Champert L. Sigafoos,<br />\nformer owner of a three-chair shop at Ohio Wesleyan, who is now an<br />\nassociate professor of linguistics and pomade.)<br />\nBut I digress. Why, you ask, is the university treasurer such a<br />\nlonely figure? Because everyone on campus is so mad at him they<br />\nwon't even say hello. And why are they so mad? Because every time they<br />\nask him for something \u2014 more equipment, more staff, more anything \u2014<br />\nhe always gives them the same answer: No.<br />\nMind you, he doesn't want to say no. In fact, your average treasurer is the sweetest, kindest guy in the world when he's off-campus\u2014<br />\nall the time tossing large bills to beggars, worming stray dogs, umpiring quilting bees for senior citizens, donating kidneys.<br />\nAnd he's more than just generous; he's jolly and merry and funloving too. Just suggest anything gay and mad\u2014 a party, a weenie<br />\nroast, a fish fry, a spelldown, a glass of Miller High Life Beer\u2014and<br />\nthere he is with bells on! Because he knows,just as you know, that no<br />\nbeer is sunnier and zestier than Miller. No beer is pleasinger to the<br />\npalate, tinglier to the taste, fulfillinger to the psyche. Oh sure, other<br />\nbeers try to imitate Miller, but they haven't got a chance because<br />\nMiller's marvelous brewing formula has been a closely guarded secret<br />\nfor over 115 years. In fact, the formula is known today to only one<br />\nman on earth\u2014Miller's chief brewmaster\u2014 and he has been programmed to self-destruct in five seconds if ever taken alive.<br />\nBut I digress. Let us, I say, stop cussing the university treasurer<br />\nand painting \"Establishment Lackey\"on his vest. Instead, let us try to<br />\nsee things from his point of view. Take,for example, the typical case of<br />\nD.O.A. Tremblatt, treasurer of a prominent Midwestern university<br />\n(Princeton) who recently turned down a request from the faculty to<br />\nincrease enrollment by 100 students.<br />\nNow, this might not seem like a lot to you, just a lousy 100 students, but do you have any idea what it would cost? First of all, you've<br />\ngot to provide additional sleeping quarters for the kids. Then of course<br />\nyou've got to provide additional teachers. And of course you've got to<br />\nprovide sleeping quarters for the teachers too. But remember, unlike<br />\nstudents, teachers get beds. This is called \"tenure.\"<br /><br />\nfeaturing the Levering Hall Players<br />\nThe Peabody Quartet, &amp; the<br />\nMajestic Ensemble<br /><br />\nCelebrating the Noel in the heart<br />\nof everything<br /><br />\nrefreshments will be served<br />\nPlease join us.<br /><br />\nteinutilter<br />\nHoward &amp; 27th Street<br /><br />\nor try our<br />\nfamous Roast<br />\nBeef Sandwich<br /><br />\nserving dinners<br />\nfrom steak<br />\nto lobster<br /><br />\nFresh Dough<br /><br />\nBut wait; there's lots more. For every teacher of course you'll<br />\nneed two graduate students to do the actual teaching. And of course<br />\nevery grad student has at least one pregnant wife, so you'll need a<br />\nkettle of boiling water for each, plus a Slinky toy for each kid after it's<br />\nborn. But wait. After the kids are born is when the real trouble begins<br />\nbecause naturally everybody is going to claim they got the wrong kid.<br />\nSo goodness knows how many lawyers and judges you'll need to<br />\nstraighten it out, not to speak of gavels.<br />\nWell sir, you total up all these added expenses and it comes to<br />\nat least 90 billion dollars, no mean sum even for Princeton. And that's<br />\nwhy Mr. Tremblatt had to say no to the faculty.<br />\nThey lynched him of course, even after he offered them each an<br />\nextra box of chalk, but I, for one, believe they overreacted.<br />\nI hope you feel the same.<br /><br />\nPizza<br /><br />\nMusic for your entertainment<br />\nfeaturing Tess and Roland with<br />\ntheir guitars<br /><br />\nDraft Beer in Frosted Mugs<br />\nOpen 7 Days a week<br /><br />\nWe, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer and the sponsors of this<br />\ncolumn, offer condolences to Mr.Tremblatt's grieving family.

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a common<br />\nenergy-yielding substance found in<br />\nall living cells.<br />\nThose are the three main ingredients in lampyridae's love light.<br />\nAnd because ATP is common to all<br />\nliving cells, university researchers<br />\ndiscovered they could produce an<br /><br />\nartificial glow by mixing luciferin<br />\nand luciferase wherever life is<br />\npresent.<br />\nNoting that phenomenon, Du Pont<br />\nscientists and engineers went on<br />\nto develop it into a practical analytical system. Correlating the intensity of the artificial \"glow\" with<br />\nthe amount of ATP present in<br />\nbacteria, they designed a means of<br />\nmeasuring the reaction.<br />\nThe result is the luminescence<br />\nbiometer\u2014the first really basic improvement in bacteria-counting<br />\nmethods since the time of Louis<br />\nPasteur.
