The first is<br />\nDr. Packard's broad professional<br />\nbackground, which includes experience in public policy, man-<br />\n<br />\nagement, scholarship and journalism.<br />\nThe new Dean's tenure as<br />\nmanaging editor and then executive editor of the Philadelphia<br />\nBulletin (1969-75) has accustomed him to dealing with the<br />\nfinancial and budgetary constraints of a private organization.<br />\nAccording to Paul Skillicorn, a<br />\nSAIS student member of the<br />\nsearch group, Packard has had<br />\nextensive experience raising<br />\nfunds from government and<br />\nprivate sources both in his<br />\nposition at Woodrow Wilson and<br />\nduring his unsuccessful 1975-76<br />\nbid for the Democratic Senate<br />\nnomination in Pennsylvania.<br />\n<br />\nMARCH 16, 1979<br />\n<br />\nPeabody<br />\n<br />\nPackard Named<br />\nNew SAIS Dean<br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\n<br />\nEleven percent off?<br />\n<br />\nOrchestra Votes<br />\nBY HARRY LERNER<br />\n<br />\n' Dr. George R. Packard<br />\nSkillicorn said an important<br />\nconsideration was Packard's<br />\nstatus as an outsider to SAIS.<br />\nThis will allow him to be more<br />\neffective, said Skillicorn, because<br />\nhe will come into his job without being perceived as favoring<br />\neither the junior or the senior<br />\nfaculty. At the same time, Dr.<br />\nPackard impressed the corn-mittee as being more aware of<br />\nthe school, its faculty, and its<br />\nproblems than any other of the<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nPackard's reputation as a<br />\ncont. on p. 7<br />\n<br />\nStudent members of the<br />\nPeabody Conservatory Orchestra<br />\nvoted Monday to reject a set of<br />\npolicy changes offered by the<br />\nPeabody Administration in response to year-long complaints<br />\nabout poor instruction and second-rate status accorded stu-dents at the Conservatory.<br />\nAlso defeated by a slim<br />\nmajority of the 90 players was a<br />\nproposal to stage a student<br />\nstrike. Most students apparently<br />\nfelt that the offer was inadequate but indicated that the<br />\n'problems might still be resolved<br />\nthrough negotiation with the<br />\nAdministration.<br />\nMost undergraduates withheld their names because of<br />\nreports that Conservatory Director Elliott Galkin said scholarships might be withdrawn from<br />\nstudents involved in a strike.<br />\nGalkin denies making such a<br />\nthreat, but even faculty members are wary. \"I think you'll<br />\n<br />\nfind people reluctant to comment just before contract time,\"<br />\nexplained one professor who<br />\nwithheld his name.<br />\nThe two principal problems<br />\ncited by students are the conduct of orchestra conductor<br />\nFred Prausnitz and the policies<br />\nof Galkin himself. The players<br />\ncomplain that Prausnitz verbally<br />\nabuses his students, and contributes little guidance at rehearsals. \"Incompetence is definitely the problem,\" said a<br />\ngraduate student. \"No player<br />\nwill be enthusiastic if the man<br />\non the podium is concerned only<br />\nwith his image and authority.\"<br />\nGalkin is under fire because<br />\nhe is responsible for choosing<br />\nthe orchestra's repertoire. One<br />\nplayer said, \"Some people feel if<br />\nthey get rid of Prausnitz everything will be all right; that's not<br />\ntrue.

Ono<br />\n<br />\nThat Fink<br />\n<br />\n!letters to the editor'<br />\n<br />\nIt's all very fine for SAC Chairman Robert Fink<br />\nto sit up in his high tower and tell everybody how<br />\nproud he is to slice the student activity budget \"for<br />\nour own good.\" But the statements Fink makes in his<br />\nopen letter on the subject have a presumptuousness<br />\nbordering on sheer arrogance.<br />\n'We feel that many student activities are not<br />\noperating with the utmost efficiency and find this<br />\nunfortunate,\" 'Fink proclaims. There may be some<br />\ntruth to the first part of the statement, but Fink<br />\nignores the equally valid point 'that students have<br />\ntheir Undergraduate careers to think about before<br />\nthey can devote all their time and attention to<br />\nrunning extracurricular affairs as super-efficient<br />\nbusinesses.<br />\nThe same criticism applies to much of Fink's<br />\nreasoning, as expressed in the letter. \"It is our belief<br />\nthat many SAC organizations have the potential of<br />\nsponsoring profitable activities,\" his message continues. \"With reorganization, some groups may no<br />\nlonger need annual grants, but can instead operate<br />\nwith seed money which will in part,(sic) be returned<br />\nat the end of each academic year....\"<br />\nAgain, Fink displays a junior executive mentality.<br />\nIt is certainly true that certain activities, like the<br />\nNews-Letter, have managed this year to attain self-sufficiency. But the trouble is, students come and<br />\nstudents go. Even if a group is able to make a profit<br />\nover a one-year period, the chances are good that<br />\nbefore long the situation will change and the operation will no longer be run so expertly. In the last four<br />\nits alone, such upheavals have occurred within<br />\nmany campus organizations. The trouble with Fink's<br />\nplan is that now when an organization goes into a<br />\ntrough, it will be much more likely than before to<br />\nsink entirely. Even worse, the seed money set-up<br />\ndestroys incentive to try and save reserves for future<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe austerity move is justified on the grounds<br />\nthat it will free resources which can \"serve the<br />\nundergraduate population in some other manner.\"<br />\nBut there are two problems with this line of reasoning. First, the $18,000 savings produced by the cut<br />\nwill amount to little more than a drop in the bucket<br />\nwhen added to general University funds. $18,000<br />\nisn't even enough to provide for one new faculty<br />\nappointment. The loss of that amount, augmented as<br />\nit inevitably 'will be by the pinch of inflation, will<br />\nhave a much more direct impact on students. Certainly more people would benefit from the lost opportunities in their extracurricular lives than from one<br />\nadditional professor in some department.<br />\nAccording to Fink's letter, \"it is our feeling that<br />\nconservative spending for activities is more appropriate than cuts to the academics for which tuition is<br />\nmuch needed.\" We disagree. The most valuable<br />\nexperiences we as students have available while we're<br />\nat Johns Hopkins are not to be obtained in any<br />\nclassroom format. They are rather the things we do to<br />\noccupy and entertain ourselves when we are not<br />\nstudying and the people we meet here along the way.<br />\nMemories of participation in organized group activities will endure long after we have forgotten how a<br />\nconsumer indifference curve is shaped.<br />\nCertainly Fink's efforts to prevent waste in SAC<br />\ngroups are good. We just feel that the fiscal squeeze<br />\non organizations may end up choking the student life<br />\nto death.<br />\n<br />\nfollowing the enactment of<br />\nhandgun control legislation, the<br />\nraw numbers (i.e., people killed<br />\nby handguns per year) will<br />\ndecline proportionally to the<br />\ndecrease in the pool of handguns. To put it on a more<br />\npersonal level, your odds of<br />\nsurvival improve. Therefore, the<br />\npool of handguns should be<br />\nreduced by legislation similar to<br />\nthat introduced by Representative Abner Mikva, banning the<br />\nsale of handguns and setting a<br />\nbounty on handguns that are<br />\nturned over to police.<br />\nOne final comment. Mr.<br />\nKnox used as evidence to<br />\nsupport possession of handguns<br />\nthe \"fact\" that even though he<br />\nhas had a loaded handgun in his<br />\nhouse for \u2022as long as he can<br />\nrecall, his 4 children were never<br />\nharmed by the gun. All I can<br />\nsay to that is \"Well Mr. Knox,<br />\nyou beat the odds, it's too bad<br />\nthat all handgun owners don't<br />\nhave your lucky streak\".<br />\n<br />\nGuns<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nCongratulations and thanks<br />\nto Mike WallIc'and the rest of the<br />\nofficers of the Freshman Class<br />\nfor putting together the informative and evocative handgun<br />\ncontrol debate last Tuesday<br />\nnight. The Bronx cheer award<br />\ngoes to the large number of<br />\nHopkins students who failed to<br />\nbe present. The sparse crowd,<br />\nand the small number of Hopkins students in the crowd are<br />\nsymptomatic of the unhealthy<br />\napathy which this camp:Is has<br />\nfor serious issues that face our<br />\nsociety (as\" compared to the<br />\nexcitement for a recent humanitarian non-issue).<br />\nDuring the debate, I was<br />\namazed at the ability of Mr.<br />\nKnox, the representative from<br />\nthe National Rifle Association,<br />\nto cook up \"loads of meaningless statistics, and then to distort<br />\nthese 'facts' to support his<br />\nargument. His favorite \"fact\"<br />\nwas that<br />\n\" 99.48% of all<br />\nhandguns are not used in crime<br />\neach year\". Therefore, according<br />\nto Mr. Knox, handgun control<br />\nlaws should control the 0.5%<br />\nwho misuse their handguns and<br />\nnot the law abiding 99.5%.<br />\nHis \"facts\" may be correct,<br />\nbut his argument is errant.<br />\nAlthough the percentage of<br />\nmisuse may remain constant<br />\n<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nDarf Pierson<br />\n<br />\nT'd Off<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Rip-Off of the Week!<br />\nAfter puzzling long over the sign<br />\nabove six boxes of fancy teas (in<br />\nindividually-wrapped foil packages -- all the same size), I asked<br />\nthe manager of the Levering<br />\nfood service for an explanation.<br />\nThe sign read:<br />\n.30<br />\nsmall<br />\n<br />\n.40<br />\nmedium<br />\n<br />\n.50<br />\nlarge<br />\n<br />\nHe explained that the price<br />\ndepended on the size cup you<br />\nused, and that even though<br />\nthe teabags were the same size,<br />\nand all you did was fill the cup,<br />\nSincerely, whatever size, with Hot water,<br />\nSaul A.

Both plans would<br />\nprovoke \"a great deal of discussion.\" Hall said, \"I would<br />\nquestion the feasability of a fee<br />\nat this time (before a study of its<br />\ncosts and benefits has been<br />\ndone).\" He also doubted whether the University would have<br />\nlarge enough financial reserves<br />\nunder a self-insurance plan to<br />\ncover long and expensive illnesses.<br />\nBoth Dr. Godenne and the<br />\ncommittees have met with Samuel Shriver, a representative of<br />\nMcDonald-Shriver Associates, an<br />\ninsurance brokerage,to discuss<br />\nthe options available and the<br />\ncosts of those options. McDonald-Shriver is interested in<br />\ndesigning a health insurance<br />\npolicy for the University.<br />\nThe problem with Blue<br />\nCross/Blue Shield is twofold,<br />\naccording to Carlton Haywood,<br />\nchairman of the student committee. The premiums are high-$212.12, more than twice as<br />\nmuch as they were when the<br />\nplan was started three years<br />\nago-and the coverage is inadequate. \"The Blue Cross policy<br />\nis shot full of exceptions and<br />\nlimitations. They'll give you<br />\n$100 a day for a semiprivate<br />\nroom, but you can't get a<br />\nsemiprivate room for $100 a day<br />\nin Baltimore.\"<br />\nGodenne believes that the<br />\nhigh cost of health insurance at<br />\nHopkins is a result of the zero<br />\ndeductible clause. \"What I<br />\nwould like to do is to get every<br />\nstudent to pay a health services<br />\nfee, and then have a medical<br />\ninsurance plan with a very high<br />\ndeductible.\" The total cost of<br />\nsuch a package, she said, would<br />\nbe less than the amount students<br />\npay now in premiums. She hopes<br />\nto hold the total cost of premium and fee to $150.<br />\nHaywood agreed that a<br />\nhealth fee might be a good idea,<br />\nbut he added,\"If the people are<br />\ngoing to pay for health services,<br />\n<br />\nwe want to see that the University provides those services.\"<br />\nHis committee is investigating a plan under which \"in<br />\neffect, Hopkins insures the student.\" Students would pay premiums into a pool administered<br />\nby the University, and then<br />\nHopkins would pay the students'<br />\nbills from the funds in that pool.<br />\nThat plan would not save<br />\nstudents much money in premiums--in fact, it could cost<br />\neven more than the present<br />\nplan--but it would offer better<br />\ncoverage, said Haywood. \"What<br />\nbothers me is that most people<br />\ndon't realize they're really not<br />\nprotected by insurance. If they<br />\nget sick, it's going to cost them a<br />\nbundle.\"<br />\nThe committee's plan would<br />\nlimit student liability. Under one<br />\nproposal being considered, the<br />\nstudent would pay the first<br />\n$100, and would be covered for<br />\n<br />\n80% of the next $2000 and for<br />\n100% of all expenses after that.<br />\n\"The most that students would<br />\npay would be $500, plus the<br />\ncost of the policy,\" he said.<br />\nThe committee is not limiting itself to an investigation of<br />\nalternative health insurance<br />\nplans. According to Haywood,<br />\nthe group is \"looking at all the<br />\nhealth services\" offered by Hopkins, including the White House<br />\nand Brown Infirmary.<br />\nThe committee is also looking into the possibility of having<br />\nfree or subsidized medication<br />\nprovided by Brown Infirmary.<br />\nThe committee got its start<br />\nlast summer when students approached Tom Schmith with<br />\ncomplaints about the cost of<br />\nhealth insurance.

The correct term is<br />\nsinistral. If that word does bad things for<br />\nyou, well, I'm sorry, but it's just because<br />\ncenturies of societies controlled by right-handers have managed to vilify us in every way they<br />\npossibly could. They call us looney, backward, awkward<br />\nand retarded, no matter what language they use. So<br />\nwhen they say to be sinister means to be spooky and<br />\nevil, why deny it? They're really only afraid of what<br />\nthey can't understand.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWell, Maybe we do have a duty to help them out a<br />\nlittle. Lefthandedness is a phenomenon poorly understood not only by your average Joe Righthander, but<br />\neven by so-called experts in the field. Not that it isn't an<br />\nintriguing subject--for centuries men have speculated and<br />\nwondered why the right should have come to consider<br />\nitself \"the master hand,\" as an author named Abram<br />\nBlau aptly put it in the title to his book on the subject.<br />\nFirst advanced in the \"modern\" period was the<br />\nvisceral dominance explanation. Supposedly espoused by<br />\nSir Francis Bacon, this theory holds that people are<br />\nmore adept and stronger on the right because the organs<br />\nof the human body are heavier on that side. Alexander<br />\nBuchanan, a Professor of Physiology at the University of<br />\nGlasgow, added the weight of learning to this argument<br />\nwhen he declared, \"With the greater weight of the liver<br />\nand lungs on the right, man tends to be able to balance<br />\nbetter on the left foot, leaving the right hand free and<br />\nready for action, and in time the muscles on the .right<br />\nside develop more strongly.\"<br />\n<br />\nU<br />\n<br />\nPersecution oflefties was rampant in the Twenties.,<br />\nLiter in the 19th century, followers of Darwin got<br />\ninto the act by postulating evolutionary reasons for the<br />\ndominance of the right hand. Ancient warriors, they<br />\nargued, carried their shields in their left hands in order<br />\nto better protect their hearts (on the left side). This left<br />\nonly the right arm free to wield the sword,so in time the<br />\ndextrally-gifted came to conquer all of civilization.<br />\nSuch theories have persisted in the 20th century. A<br />\nresearcher named W. Franklin Jones took elaborate<br />\nmeasurements of the arm bones and muscles of 20,000<br />\nsubjects aged one month to 101 years in order to establish that right-handers have longer, thicker right than left<br />\narms, and sinistrals the other way around. He also<br />\nthought 15,000,000 of the 20,000,000 cases of spinal<br />\ncurvature in the country were caused because schoolchildren had to crane their necks in order to see what<br />\nthey were writing with their right eye, and urged that all<br />\nschool desks be tilted at a 45-degree angle. If these ideas<br />\nsound a bit crazy, it's probably because left-handers<br />\ncame up with most of them.<br />\nortunately there are some more solid points<br />\nwhich can be made about handedness. Most<br />\nstriking is the predominance of right-handers<br />\nthroughout all of history and across every<br />\nculture. Cro-Magnon men who traced their<br />\nown silhouettes on rocks almost always did so with their<br />\nright hands; we know because only the left.hands are<br />\ndepicted in the drawings.. Curiously enough, however,<br />\napes show no sign whatsoever of consistent hand prefer-<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\n<br />\nence in manual tasks. This seems good enough evidence<br />\nto show that handedness, left and right, must be somehow contained in the human genetic structure, passed on<br />\nthrough heredity. Numerous studies have attempted to<br />\nprove this link, and to establish some model to explain<br />\nexactly how it works, but they invariably run afoul of<br />\none embarrassing piece of data: the majority of lefthanded people have two right-handed parents, while<br />\neven marriages between two left-handers generally<br />\nproduce right-handed children. In view of this situation,<br />\nsome theorists have proposed that there is no such thing<br />\nas biologically-inherited handedness at all, but that most<br />\npeople are simply socialized into dextrality through<br />\ncontact with a right-handed world. It has been shown<br />\nquite well that children are frequently induced by social<br />\nforces to become right-handed even when they have a<br />\nnatural sinistral inclination. But the theory still doesn't<br />\nexplain why some people are so stubbornly left-handed<br />\neven in the face of all kinds of pressure. So the best<br />\nmodern hypotheses incorporate some hereditary inclination plus environmental factors as conditions for determining a person's handedness.<br />\nOne fine theory which fits all the cultural data has<br />\nbeen politely overlooked by all the experts, however. To<br />\nput it as nicely as possible, there was once a time when<br />\nMr. Scott & Co. didn't make their soft, fluffy stuff with<br />\npretty flowers all over it. But even then, people needed<br />\nto clean themselves. So they used what was available.<br />\nEven if there was cloth around, it got dirty in a hurry,<br />\nand what's more, there weren' t any handy taps with<br />\nrunning water to wash with afterward, either. So naturally the hand used for the, task was stigmatized as dirty.<br />\nSince people tend to favor the right hand anyway in<br />\ntheir daily tasks, the left was left with the onerous duty.<br />\nYou may not believe this story, but even to this day<br />\nthere are strict taboos against eating or writing with the<br />\nleft hand throughout Africa and in all the Arab countries. The natives there get extremely upset at anybody<br />\nwho attempts to do so, even rich Americans who carry<br />\ntoilet paper in their valises.<br />\nEstimates regarding the incidence of sinistrality<br />\nhave varied widely due to the number of ways in which<br />\nit can be measured. Everybody knows about handedness,<br />\nbut did you know that you are also right- or left-eyed?<br />\nTo find out which, take this simple test. Look at any<br />\nnearby object--then slowly cover one eye. If the object<br />\nsuddenly appears to move, then your eyedness is on the<br />\nside of the eye you just covered. Try it--you might be<br />\nsuprised, for left-eyed people aren't always left-handed.<br />\nThen there are other measures, all of which have been<br />\nused: footedness, earedness and even fingeredness. But<br />\nthe preferred hand used for tasks like eating and writing<br />\nis considered the best indicator of laterality. Using this<br />\ncriterion, no reliable study has ever found the percentage<br />\nof left-handers in the population to be higher than 12%,<br />\nwith one exception. Among groups of mental defectives,<br />\nsinistrals are usually found in proportions of well over<br />\n20%. Perhaps this explains why just over a third(13 out<br />\nof 38) of the people on the News-Letter staff are lefthanders.<br />\nhen again, if we try hard enough maybe we<br />\ncan dig up some other factors. Lefthandedness, though it has not yet reached epidemic<br />\nproportions, is clearly on the rise in America. According to Dr.Jarre Levy, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the<br />\nforemost authorities on laterality today, \"In the United<br />\nStates the frequency of sinistrality as measured by the<br />\nwriting hand increased monotonically with a negatively<br />\naccelerated slope from 2.2% in 1932 to 11.1% by 1972.\"<br />\nA 1976 survey supported this assertion when it found<br />\nthat the proportion of sinistrals rises from 2.9% among<br />\n60-year-olds to 10.8% among people born since 1956.<br />\nThis increase has resulted from an increased tolerance of left-handers by our society, particularly in<br />\nthe primary school environment. During the first<br />\nyears of our century, it was a common therapy for a<br />\nchild who showed a tendency to write with his left hand<br />\nto tie his left arm behind his back until he learned\u2022to use<br />\nhis right hand. The few who managed to survive as<br />\nleft-handers were looked upon as misfits and deviants.<br />\n<br />\nThis, incidentally, may help explain why young George<br />\nHerman \"Babe\" Ruth was seen as a delinquent and<br />\nbanished to a Baltimore reform school at the tender age<br />\nof seven. While today's undergraduates may be skeptical<br />\nabout these past outrages, some older citizens can recall<br />\nthose infamous days well, although they don't like much<br />\nto talk about it. \"We're a lot more tolerant in the<br />\nschools today than we were some years ago, and there's<br />\none reason why,\" says Dr. Harry M. Robinson, an<br />\nelderly physician who practices in the Homewood area.<br />\n\"Making a child who's naturally left-handed write with<br />\nhis right hand builds up frustration in the child, and<br />\nmakes him feel like he's not normal. So it has quite a<br />\nharmful effect.\"<br />\nA recent survey of 85 students at Johns Hopkins<br />\nbears out the claim that young people are growing more<br />\nleft-handed. Slightly over 15% were found to be lefthanded, which again is higher than any other reported<br />\nfigure for a group of \"normal\" subjects. The survey also<br />\nrevealed something about the personality of a Hopkins<br />\nleft-hander: he or she is not your typical pre-med.<br />\nWhile more than half(37 of 72)of the dextrals contacted in the study were natural science area majors, only 2<br />\n<br />\nCoup d'etat: The leftist Editor and his southpaw crftes<br />\nof the 13 left-handers were concentrating in such a field.<br />\nThis helps show why over a third of the students in<br />\nmany humanities courses such as Emily Dickinson<br />\nseminars and Histories of 17th Century France can be<br />\nobserved in class writing with their left hands.<br />\nIt also fits well with the clinical evidence which has<br />\nbeen adduced to show that sinistrals are more creative--or at least think differently--than other people.<br />\nThese speculations all rest on the much-vaunted \"cerebral dominance\" theory of laterality. This view holds<br />\nthat the left side of the body is controlled by the right<br />\nside of the brain, and the left side of the body by the<br />\nleft side of the brain. Dextrals have \"dominant\" left<br />\nhemispheres, while sinistrals have dominant right hemispheres. Since the left hemisphere contains the principal<br />\nspeech center and the right hemisphere is more abstract,<br />\nleft-handers are admitted to be somewhat more creative<br />\nthan right-handers, but then, their reading and language<br />\nskills have been correspondingly maligned.<br />\nA mountain of research has been done to check and<br />\nexpand this hypothesis, and some interesting results<br />\nhave emerged. For example, one experiment using<br />\nmirror-images of the same vacation slides viewed by both<br />\nright and left-handers showed that right-handers prefer-<br />\n<br />\nnit!<br />\n<br />\n\ft.rif ORMENACE7<br />\n****-* **** k*****<br />\n<br />\nis<br />\nre<br />\n<br />\n;o<br />\nis<br />\nd.<br />\nt2<br />\n<br />\nred pictures with \"important\" features on the right side,<br />\nwhile the sinistral subjects liked the mirror-images<br />\nof the same slides better. As a result of some of these<br />\nstudies, a few changes have been made in the basic<br />\ncerebral dominance model. It is now believed that<br />\nleft-handedness does not imply right-side brain dominance, but rather a more general operation involving<br />\nboth halves about equally. This explains why sinistrals<br />\nhave a considerably greater tendency to do some things<br />\nright-handed and more frequently consider themselves<br />\nambidextrous than do dextrals.<br />\nAnother proposal based on a battery of tests administered by Levy contends that only some left-handers<br />\nhave the \"creative\" brain structure attributed to them<br />\nby the dominance theory, and that a few right-handers<br />\nhave it also. The way you tell, according to Levy, is to<br />\nlook at the way you write. If you are left-handed, and<br />\nyou hold the pen below the line you are writing on, then<br />\nyou are a \"creative.\" But if you hold it above the line,<br />\nPointing toward the bottom of the page, then you really<br />\nstill have a regular old right-handed brain. Now if you're<br />\nright-handed, and do it the first way, you're a \"normal,\"<br />\nbut if you hold the pen above the line, you're a \"crea-<br />\n<br />\npaw cronies celebrate successful Gatehouse power grab.<br />\n<br />\nId.<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nbe<br />\n<br />\nLas<br />\natle.<br />\n<br />\nds<br />\nJit<br />\nhe<br />\n!ft<br />\n<br />\n)al<br />\n<br />\nye<br />\nge<br />\n<br />\ntive.\" At least one piece of evidence in support of this<br />\n\u00b0pinion can be found in noted News-Letter scribe<br />\nCates Baldridge, a right-hander who holds his pen in a<br />\nfunny way above the line he is writing. While you might<br />\nnot like the stuff Mr. Baldridge dreams up, you have to<br />\nadmit he is one of the more creative creatures around<br />\nthis University.<br />\nBecause left-handers have a more general brain<br />\nfunction than right-handers, they have a much better<br />\nrecord of surviving strokes and other forms of brain<br />\ndamage with little harm. Some scientists have tried to<br />\nsuggest that this makes them evolutionarily stronger<br />\nthan right-handers, and that eventually left-handers<br />\nWill take over the world. Whether for this or for some<br />\nOther reason, right-handed societies have always tended<br />\nto. view sinistrals darkly. Maybe they think we're not<br />\ngoing to wait that long.<br />\n<br />\nIts<br />\nng<br />\nth<br />\ngarage<br />\n<br />\nt is a little-known fact that left-handed<br />\nwriting is officially forbidden in the Soviet<br />\nUnion, East Germany, and five other Eastern<br />\nEuropean countries. Yet when has President<br />\nCarter ever made one protest against this<br />\nin all his talk about human rights? Since when<br />\n<br />\nhas it been a key stumbling block to the completion of<br />\nthe SALT talks, or even to a few measly machinery<br />\nshipments? Never. This sweeping under the rug of the<br />\nplight of millions of innocent people we must protest as<br />\nmanifest evidence of the hypocrisy of U.S. foreign<br />\npolicy. But as for the offending governments\u2014they are<br />\njust hurting themselves. Jones (the guy who measured<br />\narms) found in his group of 20,000 people that 75% of<br />\nthe ones who stuttered had been forced to write with<br />\ntheir right hand even though they were naturally left-handed. If Mr. Edward Gierek wants to have a bunch of<br />\nstammering Polocks on his hands, then so be it. But look<br />\nat the positive side, at the marvels that are lost if sinistrals are repressed. Of the greatest men and women in<br />\nalmost every field of endeavor, about half are invariably<br />\nleft-handed. Which is kind of a left-handed way of<br />\nsaying: Left is not Ludicrous; Left is Luscious. Witness<br />\nKim Novak and Marilyn Monroe.<br />\nAnd in sports--man, in sports, are the southpaws<br />\nsuper! Both today's stars and the heroes of the past have<br />\nbeen left-handed in proportions nowhere close to this<br />\n10% business. In basketball, there's Bill Walton and John<br />\nLucas, and if you look to the past, there stands the<br />\nmammoth spectre of Bill Russell. And southpaw excellence is by no means limited to Americans. True, Jimmy<br />\nConnors of Bellevue, Illinois is one of the very best<br />\ntennis players in the world, but so is Argentinian<br />\nGuillermo Vilas. And some say the left-handed Aussie<br />\nRod Laver was the best who ever lived. Actually, one of<br />\nhis countrymen by the name of Ken Rosewall might<br />\nhave actually become the undisputed greatest, but in his<br />\nyouth he was made to switch from his left to his right<br />\nhand. Though he had ground strokes good enough to<br />\nwin him 'many matches against Laver, his serve always<br />\nremained a weak spot, a fact he always attributed to<br />\nhis play with the \"wrong\" hand. Even in soccer, sinistrals are currently enjoying a period of splendour. The<br />\ntwo leading scorers in last summer's World Cup competition were Mario Kempes of Argentina and Robby<br />\nRensenbrink of Holland, both left-footed.<br />\nThen there's baseball. Ron Guidry, Reggie Jackson--what can we say? What haven't left-handers done in<br />\nbaseball? Play catcher, that's one thing from which<br />\nthey've been absolutely excluded. And second. And<br />\nshort. But the man acclaimed as the greatest third-baseman of all time was a left-hander. That's right,Baltimore'<br />\nBrooks Robinson. Brooks eats, writes, and does everything else except throw a baseball with his left hand. He<br />\nnever had a particularly strong throwing arm as a player--but the things he could do with his left gloved hand,<br />\nnobody else could match.<br />\nLeft-handers have also achieved greatness in more<br />\nsignificant fields. Alexander the Great and Charlemagne,<br />\nfor example. Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. Ringo<br />\nStarr and Paul McCartney. Then there's the most notorious of all\u2014in 1888, the coroner's inquest into the brutal<br />\nstabbing death of a prostitute named Martha Turner<br />\nofficially established that her assailant, popularly dubbed \"Jack the Ripper,\" wielded the weapon with his left<br />\nhand.<br />\nut while left-handers seem well-suited for<br />\nsuch great callings, they frequently run into<br />\ndifficulty when they try to lead a more<br />\nmundane life. Even as they enter the world,<br />\n\u2022they are already forced to follow a rougher<br />\nroad than their dextral counterparts. A questionnaire<br />\nstudy done in 1973 found that left-handed college<br />\nstudents reported more parental accounts of stressful<br />\nbirths. Then, when they get a bit older and people find<br />\nout about them being left-handed, they immediatley<br />\na bit daffy. Let's put it this way: how<br />\nget labeled<br />\nmany people do you know who are familiarly referred to<br />\nas Righty? Admittedly, Vernon Preston Gomez, known<br />\nas Lefty when he pitched for the Yankees 40 years ago,<br />\ndid little to help matters when he suddenly stopped in<br />\nthe middle of an inning on the pitcher's mound to stare<br />\nfor several minutes at an airplane passing overhead. And<br />\nthe last left-handed President with whom we were<br />\nblessed, namely Gerald Ford, also did his share to mess<br />\nup our public relations with his weekly stumblings and<br />\nbumpings of the head upon descent from airplanes.<br />\n<br />\nB<br />\n<br />\nIn some vocations, however,left-handers have worse<br />\ndisadvantages than a flaky reputation. A left-handed<br />\ncarpenter faces a choice between severing his sinistrality<br />\non the job or severing several fingers' with an electric<br />\nsaw. Almost every-device which can possibly be designed<br />\nfor right-handers is made that way. Cars, in particular,<br />\nwith pedals to be operated mostly by the right foot and<br />\ngears to be shifted with the right hand, are stubborn<br />\nobstacles to be surmounted by would-be sinistral drivers.<br />\nLadles, scissors and can openers are all ingeniously<br />\nintended for right-handed use. Fountain pens are usually<br />\nsmudge city for southpaws, but there is a way: hold the<br />\npaper with the left edge slanting upward, and lean<br />\nyour writing back to the left. You might have to learn to<br />\nwrite all over again, though, so it's fortunate that Baron<br />\nMarcel Bich had the kindness to bring us his ball point<br />\npen, which works fine for left-handers.<br />\nAt the table, left-handers have even more problems.<br />\nFirst of all, whenever they sit to the right of a regular<br />\nperson, the two wind up rubbing elbows, which can be<br />\nembarrassing unless the guy sitting next to you is Henry<br />\nKissinger. Silverware is always set up backwards for<br />\nleft-handers--especially in the best places. And worst of<br />\nall is when you get one of those mugs with a neat<br />\nlittle picture on the front. When you hold it in your left<br />\nhand, you never can see the damned thing!,\u201e.<br />\n<br />\nThe sinistralist today...<br />\nEmerging from the closet,<br />\nRreaking the chains of history.<br />\n<br />\nn order to combat these iniquities and to<br />\nhelp people cope in the meantime, we've<br />\nformed a new organization right here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins called The Party of the Left.<br />\nOur founder and first candidate for President, the noted intellectual Howard Kaplan, pledged in<br />\nhis initial speech that \"Our aims shall be totally sinister,\" although he welcomed any disillusioned Marxists<br />\nwho might care to join.\"No longer will we be content to<br />\nsit still while the rest of the country hands us the leftovers..,\" Kaplan proclaimed as he concluded his fiery<br />\nexhortation. Already, The Party of the Left has worked<br />\nbehind the scenes to persuade the Bookcenter to carry<br />\nleft-handed notebooks. The next big protest issue, which<br />\nKaplan plans to carry in a petition before the Student<br />\nCouncil, calls for the installation of at least five left-handed desks in every room of Gil-man.<br />\nBut in view of the rising sinistral population nationwide, The Party by no means plans to limit its scope<br />\nto Hopkins. Kaplan, Paul Berchielli, and the other group<br />\nleaders have conceived a brilliant strategy for securing<br />\npermanent guarantees of left-rights. The Party of the<br />\nLeft will join forces with the Women's Libbers, Right to<br />\nLifers, and Tax Revolters in exchange for a clause in the<br />\nforthcoming Constitutional Amendment amending the<br />\n14th Amendment to read \"...Nor shall any State deprive<br />\nany person of life, liberty, property, or handedness,<br />\nwithout due process of law...\"<br />\nWe're an up-and-coming young group, and we know<br />\nyou may want to join us in our battle. Please do not<br />\nhesitate to do so,even if you happen to be right-handed.<br />\nWe're always willing to make new converts, for our aims<br />\nare as simple as our motto: To Get A Better America-Turn Left!<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / MARCH 16, 1979<br />\n<br />\nHousing Lottery<br />\n<br />\nYa Gotta<br />\nPlay To<br />\nLose!<br />\nby MARK GRAY<br />\nLast week the.housing office held its annual lottery.<br />\nAlthough it represents an attempt to make a more<br />\nequitable distribution of the precious spaces, the lottery,<br />\nin my view, is doomed. It was originally conceived as a<br />\nfair way to service the housing needs of the undergraduate, graduate, and transfer student community.<br />\nThe system as it exists now, however, is bogged down in<br />\nsuch bureaucratic red tape, and administrative dogmatism, that it succeeds only in discouraging the freshmen<br />\nand transfer students from using its resources.<br />\nThe lottery is an excellent example of how a good<br />\nidea can be turned into a bad reality. I was sitting<br />\ncomfortably at home on the seventh floor of Wolman<br />\nHall watching a T.V. news report about foreign refugees.<br />\nSuddenly, my roommate came running into my room.<br />\n\"They're going to throw you out,\" he screamed.<br />\n\"What?\" I said in total surprise. \"Who? Who's going to<br />\nthrow me out? Of where?\" I said. \"The building.<br />\nHousing is tossing you out of the building.\" Just then<br />\nhe- handed me an ominous looking sheet of paper.<br />\nWritten near the top, in brazen blue lettering, were the<br />\nwords, \"Notice of Housing Lottery Information<br />\nSession.\"<br />\n\"I won't let them take you alive!\"i Joe screamed.<br />\n\"We can fight this! We'll lock'em out!\"<br />\n<br />\n\"It was weeks before the police found Herman and<br />\nhis van,\" said Steve. \"It was parked in a Taco Bell<br />\nparking lot in Modesto, California. By then, it was past<br />\nmid-terms, and the semester was gone. Herman never<br />\ncame back to school after that. The last we heard from<br />\nhim, he had joined the Hari Krishnas, and was working<br />\nas a part-time insurance agent for the Good Hands<br />\nPeople.\"<br />\n\"Gee whiz,\" I said. \"I didn't know how important<br />\nthe lottery was. Imagine having to live in a metal cage in<br />\na garage like an animal.\"<br />\n\"Or worse,\" said Steve. \"Imagine becoming an<br />\ninsurance agent in Modesto, California.\"<br />\nThe next day, I went down to the housing office to<br />\nget the proper forms. After I filled out the multicolored slips I returned them to housing.<br />\nAbout a week later I went down to see about<br />\nmaking a change on one form. When I arrived I was<br />\nshocked to see a long snaking line worming its way down<br />\nthe hall, and out of sight into the corridor. At first I<br />\nthought it was some kind of outdoor club activity,<br />\nbut then I noticed that only a few people were carrying<br />\ntents. In an attempt to determine the line's real<br />\npurpose, I cautiously approached. \"Hello,\" I said.<br />\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Simultaneously, about a<br />\ndozen or so line members held up multi-colored housing<br />\nslips.<br />\n\"We're waiting to turn in our housing slips,\" said a<br />\ngirl.<br />\n\"Really,\" I said. \"Some of you really came well<br />\nprepared. How long have you been here?\"<br />\n\"Oh, you mean the sandwiches, and the thermos<br />\nbottles,\" said the girl.<br />\n\"Yes, that plus the ba:kpacks, and the blankets,\" I<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Well,\" said the girl, \"you never know how long it<br />\nwill take to get something out of housing.\"<br />\nThe crowd was beginning to suspect me of line-cutting, so I thought that I should move on. \"Good luck,\"<br />\nI said. \"I just have to make a form change,so I'm going<br />\nto the front of the line.\" As quickly as I could I pushed<br />\nmy way through the crowd to the front. At the door of<br />\nthe housing office a dark, acne-ravaged sentinal greeted<br />\nme with a cool \"What do You want?\"<br />\n<br />\nSex Is Swell<br />\nBut It Just<br />\nDon't Sell<br />\n(CPS)--\"Sex Sells--\" it's said to be Madison Avenue's<br />\nFirst Commandment. But that may not be so anymore,<br />\nif two recent studies are any indication.<br />\nNudity and the use of sexy models in advertising<br />\nmay actually blunt the effectiveness of ads, according to<br />\nseparate studies done at the University of Texas-Arlington and the University of Wisconsin. The researchers<br />\nfound that clothed, plain-jane or john models create<br />\nmore acceptance in advertising.<br />\nThe UT researchers, M.Wayne Alexander and Ben<br />\nJudd, Jr., have replicated a 1969 study that non-sexual<br />\nillustrations were more effective than sexual ones in<br />\npromoting brand-name recall. After showing 15 slides<br />\ncontaining brand names and various degrees of female<br />\nnudity to 181 male subjects, they reached the same<br />\nconclusion.<br />\nIn non-sexual pastoral scenes, significantly more<br />\nbrand names were recalled. But while Alexander and<br />\nJudd had predicted that brand-name recall would decline<br />\nas nudity increased, they found it approximately the<br />\nsame for the various degrees of nudity shown.<br />\nMeanwhile, Michael Baker and Gilbert Churchill, Jr.,<br />\ncompleted a study that would put Mrs. Olsen above<br />\nFarrah Fawcett-Majors in product selling capabilities.<br />\nStudents indicated that the more comely models<br />\nmade better ads, but the cuter models didn't sell the<br />\nproduct. Students, especially male students, were more<br />\noften persuaded to buy coffee held by an unattractive<br />\nwoman than a pretty one. The research team surmised<br />\nthat perhaps the plainer female was more believable,<br />\nand created a liking for the product.<br />\n<br />\nPositively<br />\n,Charles<br />\nStreet<br />\nFor the questions, see page 11.<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nk<br />\n<br />\n\"lousing hopeful receives rough treatmentfrom lottery officials.<br />\n\"1 know Karate!\" added my other roommate<br />\nSteve.

A freshman; a math major; a nice guy with a lot of promise. He<br />\n'forgot' to enter the lottery, and let the date pass. The<br />\nnext thing he knew they were telling him to get Out of<br />\nthe freshman dorms. He didn't have any place to go. It<br />\nwas pitiful' Joe sighed. \"He wandered from apartment ,<br />\nhouse to apartment house trying to get someone to<br />\naccept his housing payment. Everywhere he went they<br />\njust laughed at him. Finally, in disgust, he went to the<br />\nAction Ford used truck center on Reisterstown Road.<br />\nAfter some dickering he bought a 1966 used Ford van,<br />\nand parked it in the Homewood garage. The television<br />\nreception was terrible, and there was no toilet at all, but<br />\nHerman made the best of it......<br />\n\"Poor old Herman,\" said Steve.<br />\n\"The real tradegy is that his van was not there two<br />\nweeks, before auto thieves broke into the garage one<br />\nnight, and stole the van. Herman in it, and all.\" '<br />\n<br />\n\"Well,\" I said, a little taken aback by the rudeness,<br />\n\"I'm a student here\"<br />\nA pause. \"Is that supposed to impress me?\"<br />\n\"Well, 'er, no,\" I said. \"I just want to make a<br />\nchange on one housing form.\"<br />\n\"All housing forms are final. No changes. No<br />\nalterations. No corrections. Have a nice day. Goodbye.\"<br />\n\"But wait a minute.

Yes, you children living in those<br />\nhomes monitored by the Neilson Television rating company, you do not turn<br />\noff your television sets. Your program<br />\npreferences control our program offerings; television shows come and go<br />\naccording to your whims. Why don't you<br />\nrebel? Why don't you demand the respect<br />\nthat you deserve? Why don't you just<br />\nturn off the shoddy commercials, the<br />\ntaped guffaws, and the disturbing violence?<br />\nChildren don't turn off their television sets because they don't realize that<br />\nthey are betraying us, or themselves, by<br />\nwatching. it is unfair to accuse children<br />\nwho continue to watch the programs on<br />\ntelevision of betraying anyone. Many<br />\nchildren under twelve can't separate<br />\nreality from distorted reality on television. Preschoolers can't even separate<br />\ncommercials from regular programs.<br />\nCommercials are not annoying intrusions<br />\nto them, but are action-packed, attentiongrabbing stories which convince them<br />\nthat junk is great. It is not until children<br />\nare about eleven or twelve years old that<br />\nthey can see through advertisements.<br />\nAfter they develop a healthy scepticism<br />\ntoward television and advertising,- hardened cynicism sets in. A typical reaction<br />\nis to dismiss all commercials as phony.

It is meant to stir and<br />\nexcite people. It may even exhaust or<br />\nfrustrate the listener. Many people react<br />\nnegatively when they encounter this in<br />\nmusic; yet it is the same kind of stimulation they go to the theater or read a book<br />\nfor. Taka-i-ki is a group that addresses<br />\nitself to those who consider music to be<br />\nmuch more than a tranquilizer. Presented<br />\nby the JHU Fine Arts Committee on<br />\nMarch 10, 'they played dynamic and<br />\nadventurous jazz revealing diverse influences as well as obvious originality.<br />\nTaka-i-ki consists of George Bishop<br />\non soprano and tenor sax and clarinet<br />\nSteve Buchanan on alto sax, Elliot Levin<br />\non soprano and tenor saxes and flutes,<br />\nand Rick Innacone on electric guitar.<br />\nFunctioning as a well-coordinated group,<br />\nthese four musicians displayed an ability<br />\nto understand and react to each other<br />\neven in fast, complex improvisations<br />\nwhen a three-saxophone-combination<br />\nmight easily lose coherence. The range of<br />\nsounds coaxed from the instruments was<br />\ntremendously varied. Saxophones went<br />\nfrom rasping, breathy dirges to gutteral<br />\nexplosions to heavy pulsating vibrato.<br />\nThrough \"overblowing,\" the registers of<br />\nthe tenor might be extended into soprano<br />\nand the soprano blown into a screeching<br />\nfury, while through split tones, harmonic<br />\npatterns could be extended. Sometimes<br />\nthe sound was reminiscent of Terry<br />\nRiley's smooth developments; at other<br />\ntimes it called to mind the swirling<br />\nmixtures of Albert Ayler or Pharoah<br />\nSanders. Innacone's guitar, augmented by<br />\n<br />\nan array of electronic treatment devices,<br />\ncould produce sweeping infinite sustains,<br />\nreverberating oscillations, and many unusual \"electronic\" sounds. Often he was<br />\nresponsible for maintaining an ostinato<br />\nwhile the reeds improvised; he also<br />\nentered directly into improvisations,<br />\nadding another pattern or simply abstract<br />\nsplashes of color to the musical weave.<br />\nTaka-i-ki combined written composition with group and solo improvisations.<br />\nThe written music and guidelines they<br />\nreferred to during the performance were a<br />\nframework which supported and directed<br />\nthe otherwise free improvisaion. This was<br />\nevident in the overall impression of order<br />\none got from listening to the music.<br />\nFrenetic, near anarchic sound was balanced and quenched by sections that<br />\nexplored intervals of the major triad.<br />\nSections of jabbing, pointillistic sound<br />\nwould give way to motoric unison passages with a definite \"swing,\" which<br />\nwould in turn be transformed as the<br />\ninstruments stopped, started, accelerated,<br />\nfaded in and out. Unison to build a varied<br />\ntapestry of sound also lent itself to<br />\nconstruction of ostinatos \"stacked\" on<br />\ntop of each other.<br />\nThe music was essentially melodic in<br />\nform, although this melody was usually<br />\njagged, tortuous, and fragmentary. The<br />\nform was built up by repeating motivic<br />\nfragments over and over, each time with<br />\naccretions in a process of cumulative<br />\ngrowth and decay. An opening theme<br />\nwould set mood, rudiments of melody,<br />\nareas of pitch and/or rhythm as points of<br />\ndeparture for the players to explore. It<br />\n<br />\ndid not necessarily set up chord or<br />\nphrasing patterns; if it did, these were<br />\nexpanded, condensed, and used freely.<br />\nThe musical texture was fluid, with<br />\nrhythms appearing and disappearing,<br />\ncontinuity yielding to discontinuity.<br />\nSometimes a texture of atonality might<br />\nbe set up by juxtaposition of the alto's<br />\nlines with those of the guitar.<br />\nThe first composition performed on<br />\nSaturday night was \"Fools Before the<br />\nRain\" by Bishop. It was probably the<br />\nmost accessable piece presented, having<br />\nas motifs several \"Latin\" melodies and<br />\nhaving a fairly constant rhythm. It<br />\nintroduced Taka-i-ki's preoccupation with<br />\nsimultaneous variation around a melodic<br />\nline and the simultaneous occurrence of<br />\nindependent and unrelated melodies. The<br />\nguitar provided a constant accompaniment of percussive popping, bass tones,<br />\nand glissandos. Solos were played by each<br />\nof the saxophones, then brought back in<br />\nsuperposition to each other at later times.<br />\n\"Shilup,\" composed by Debbie<br />\nQuinn was next. This series of seven<br />\nshort pieces was my favorite. It was<br />\nplayed from a graphical score, consisting<br />\nof curves, dots, etc. about a central axis.<br />\nAt its completion, the score was turned<br />\nupside down and played again. The score<br />\nindicated areas of pitch and volume,<br />\nleaving much up to the musicians' creativity. The opening and closing sections<br />\nwere done entirely with voice, a meditative chant including other vocal effects.<br />\nThe various sections featured different<br />\ninstrumental combinations. Sections four<br />\nand five were outstanding examples of<br />\n<br />\ntwo approaches to the \"cloud of sound\"<br />\n(e.g. Coleman's \"Science Fiction\") method: one very anarchic, the other based<br />\non many repetitive figures, rapid chromatic scales and bridges, and random<br />\naccents.<br />\nBishop then played a solo piece for<br />\nalto clarinet, which offered some fascinating gurgling tones going from low to<br />\nhigh register, and haunting low-register<br />\nwork. The penultimate piece was Ayler's<br />\n\"New Generation,\" which ahs become a<br />\nsort of anthem for the new jazz. It was<br />\nparticularly suited to Taka-i-ki's treatment since it was originally performed<br />\nwith electric guitar and multiple saxophones. The final work was a consolidation of two pieces, \"Fed 4 Thought\"<br />\n(Levin) and \"Cheap Talk, Dirty Wine\"<br />\n(Bishop). Guitar was prominent in this<br />\nlong and engaging set. All of the forms<br />\nand techniques the musicians had been<br />\nusing thus far were restated and integrated in the final piece(s). There was<br />\nmuch emphasis on central pitches to<br />\nwhich other tension-producing chords<br />\nwere opposed 'by the guitar. A major<br />\nmotif was a musical shape that tumbled<br />\nfrom high to low register of alto and<br />\ntenor saxes. Steve Buchanan performed<br />\nan Oriental dance to a guitar solo of<br />\nflowing, gliding masses of sound. Other<br />\nhighlights were the spatial effect of the<br />\nmusicians walking around the audience<br />\nwhile playing, and Buchanan's somersaulting around the audience.<br />\nI suggest Taka-i-ki to anyone who<br />\nlikes to be challenged by their music.<br />\n--Mark Skoner<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / P 1GE 19<br />\n<br />\nr\u2014 WEEKEND<br />\no<br />\n<br />\neFite Aka eleArldt;n4 Wpm:yew:0<br />\nWiee Witti<br />\nRai<br />\n<br />\n4inginy<br />\n<br />\nReneti6dagtee aid,e4<br />\na/ni a/teat/yet&<br />\nand Xietkna,<br />\ncr,e4iietfi4 9fa4ezs, CA. 52<br />\n<br />\nFriday & Saturday<br />\n<br />\n..\"\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\"-<br />\n<br />\nMarch 16 & 17<br />\nRemsen 1 \u2014 7:30 & 10:00<br />\nADMISSION $1.00<br />\n<br />\nADMISSION FREE<br />\nSATURDAY MARCH 17<br />\n8 PM<br />\n<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\n<br />\nBARNSTORMERS<br />\nPRESENT<br />\n<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nSTUDIO THEATRE<br />\nPRODUCTION<br />\n<br />\n(-7/4M400 flL1<br />\nCu<br />\nFterr-rc,my<br />\n<br />\nA GOO DRAMA<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\n<br />\nSusan Griffin<br />\n<br />\ncEs<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY, MARCH 16 7:30 PM<br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 18 7:00 PM USTENINg-VIEWiNg ROOM IEVERiNg<br />\nAdMISSION<br />\n<br />\nhALE<br />\n.50<br />\n<br />\nthe ?c)c k f jarnonak<br />\n<br />\nEvEE<br />\n<br />\n131:<br />\n<br />\nP\\<br />\nMAGICAu.1<br />\n<br />\nG1a55<br />\nPaif 12i0<br />\n<br />\n1Pon6oReo<br />\nqr, Cie6l)<br />\n5octl Csynro{{-ee<br />\n<br />\nof(scio06<br />\n* 4,<br />\n<br />\n11 A K-C<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n9\u20ac0<br />\n<br />\n/1<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n,<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nFEe<br />\n14fzi y<br />\nwo F\u2022E\u2022 is J4. c LitsS<br />\nSSio<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 20 I MARCH 16 1979<br />\n<br />\nThe Ratbskeilarz<br />\nSIOecoalk Baccet<br />\n<br />\nDiscover your place<br />\nin the scheme ofthings.<br />\n<br />\nServing Lunch 11:30.to 2.00 PM'<br />\nMonOag<br />\n3/19<br />\nTueseiag<br />\n3/20<br />\nWebneseoag<br />\n<br />\nPRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR POWER PLANT<br />\nis a place<br />\nin the<br />\nA place in the Navy's Nuclear Field<br />\nforefront of today's fastest-growing energy field.

He<br />\ncommented that this week is the<br />\nfirst time the team has had a<br />\nchance to practice outdoors.<br />\nFurthermore, the field is still in<br />\n.poor condition due to all the<br />\nwet winter weather) a further<br />\nimpediment to practice.<br />\n<br />\nNevertheless, Coach Myers<br />\nfeels the team has a good team<br />\nattitude<br />\nhas shown<br />\nand<br />\nsome improvement since it first<br />\nbegan practiCe in February. He<br />\nfeels that the strongest area of<br />\nthe team is its close defense,<br />\nwhere the two co-captains are<br />\nChip Carlson and Kevin Keefer.<br />\nKeefer is being converted from a<br />\nmidfielder. Duncan Swezy, a<br />\ntransfer student from Furman,<br />\nwill also play defense. Swezy,<br />\nwho also serves as a Blue Jay<br />\nfootball player, is ineligible to<br />\nplay this year, but is spending<br />\nthe season honing his fielding<br />\nskills. He is one of several<br />\nfootball and basketball players<br />\nwho have never played lacrosse<br />\nbefore, but who have joined this<br />\nyear's JV squad.<br />\nStarting in the net for the<br />\nJays will be Phil Lasalle, an<br />\n<br />\nexperienced veteran in the goalie's case. The other two goalies<br />\nare Barry Caplan and Rusty<br />\nMay.<br />\nThree corps of midfielders<br />\nwill be used by Coach Myers<br />\nthroughout the 1979 season. His<br />\ndefensive midfield squad includes<br />\nBond,<br />\nJay<br />\nGeorge<br />\nKatzenberger and Bernie Lane.<br />\nHis offensive midfield lines are<br />\nnot quite set yet, but at present<br />\nthey include Dan Jackson, Joe<br />\nCox and Todd Dietrich, along<br />\nwith Jim Bourdon, Randy<br />\nMayne and Matt May.<br />\nThe chief weakness of the<br />\nteam probably lies in the attack.<br />\nPaul Cook, who was cut from<br />\nthe varsity earlier this year, is<br />\nbeing converted from the midfield to an attack position. The<br />\nother two attackmen are Kyle<br />\nHicks and Mike Lee.<br />\n<br />\nCaptains Lead Jays<br />\nBY ANDREW COHEN<br />\nSuperb leadership has always been the key to a championship ball team. The National<br />\nChampion Blue Jay Lacrosse<br />\nteam is no exception. Senior<br />\nco-captains Dave Huntley and<br />\nSteve 'Vey have been providing<br />\nimportant leadership to the team<br />\nfor the past season and a half.<br />\nAll-American<br />\nmid fielder<br />\nHuntley has been playing lacrosse since the age of seven.<br />\nThe six footer from Rexdale,<br />\nOntario, Canada played the<br />\ngame of box lacrosse until he<br />\ncame to Hopkins. \"Box lacrosse<br />\nis played in a hockey arena,\"<br />\n<br />\n000<br />\n<br />\nexplained Huntley. \"There are<br />\nfive players on each side, and<br />\nyou basically play each position<br />\nwhen the situation arises.\" In=terestingly enough, this shooting star was not recruited by the<br />\nBlue Jay coaching staff. Instead,<br />\nthrough a series of slight connections Dave was given the<br />\nopportunity to try out for the<br />\nsquad. With his talents, he had<br />\nlittle trouble making the transition to field lacrosse.<br />\n\"The first few games were a<br />\nlittle tough,\" admitted the middie. \"You have to think a lot<br />\nmore in field lacrosse, and, of<br />\ncourse, you have to be a better<br />\nathlete.\"<br />\nBy his sophomore<br />\ncampaign, Huntley was on the<br />\nfirst midfield team to stay. He<br />\nwas also selected as an All-American in his second and third<br />\nseasons.<br />\nMidfielder Steve Wey, unlike his cohort, was born and<br />\nbred here in Baltimore. He<br />\nbegan his lax career in seventh<br />\ngrade and continued it on the<br />\nhigh school level at Calvert<br />\nHall. When it came time for<br />\nSteve to decide which college he<br />\nwanted to attend, there was<br />\nno question in his mind. Swey<br />\n(as he is sometimes called)<br />\nturned down full scholarships<br />\nat the University of North<br />\nCarolina and the University of<br />\nVirginia in order to opt for the<br />\nBlue Jays. \"Ever since I was a<br />\nkid,\" Steve explained, \"I had<br />\nwanted to play for Johns Hopkins. There is more prestige and<br />\nlacrosse tradition at this school<br />\nthan at any other\" Wey first got<br />\na taste of Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\nwhen, as a youngster, he performed the infamous duties of<br />\nball retriever at all Homewood<br />\ngames. This hard-working player<br />\nbroke into the starting lineup<br />\nright away, and now lines up<br />\nwith Huntley on the top midfielder string.<br />\nBoth captains felt that last<br />\nyear's championship victory over<br />\nCornell at Rutgers was their<br />\ngreatest effort in a Blue Jay<br />\nuniform. \"We were down after<br />\nthe regular season loss to Cornell<br />\nhere,\" Wey commented, \"but<br />\nChic (Coach Henry Ciccarone)<br />\nconvinced us that we were better<br />\nthan Cornell. We really believed<br />\nthat we were going to win.\"<br />\n<br />\nLax Fees<br />\n<br />\nEvenings 5 P.M.-11 P.M. Sunday thru Friday<br />\nNights 11 P.M.-8 A.M.

Ono<br /><br />\nThat Fink<br /><br />\n!letters to the editor'<br /><br />\nIt's all very fine for SAC Chairman Robert Fink<br />\nto sit up in his high tower and tell everybody how<br />\nproud he is to slice the student activity budget \"for<br />\nour own good.\" But the statements Fink makes in his<br />\nopen letter on the subject have a presumptuousness<br />\nbordering on sheer arrogance.<br />\n'We feel that many student activities are not<br />\noperating with the utmost efficiency and find this<br />\nunfortunate,\" 'Fink proclaims. There may be some<br />\ntruth to the first part of the statement, but Fink<br />\nignores the equally valid point 'that students have<br />\ntheir Undergraduate careers to think about before<br />\nthey can devote all their time and attention to<br />\nrunning extracurricular affairs as super-efficient<br />\nbusinesses.<br />\nThe same criticism applies to much of Fink's<br />\nreasoning, as expressed in the letter. \"It is our belief<br />\nthat many SAC organizations have the potential of<br />\nsponsoring profitable activities,\" his message continues. \"With reorganization, some groups may no<br />\nlonger need annual grants, but can instead operate<br />\nwith seed money which will in part,(sic) be returned<br />\nat the end of each academic year....\"<br />\nAgain, Fink displays a junior executive mentality.<br />\nIt is certainly true that certain activities, like the<br />\nNews-Letter, have managed this year to attain self-sufficiency. But the trouble is, students come and<br />\nstudents go. Even if a group is able to make a profit<br />\nover a one-year period, the chances are good that<br />\nbefore long the situation will change and the operation will no longer be run so expertly. In the last four<br />\nits alone, such upheavals have occurred within<br />\nmany campus organizations. The trouble with Fink's<br />\nplan is that now when an organization goes into a<br />\ntrough, it will be much more likely than before to<br />\nsink entirely. Even worse, the seed money set-up<br />\ndestroys incentive to try and save reserves for future<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe austerity move is justified on the grounds<br />\nthat it will free resources which can \"serve the<br />\nundergraduate population in some other manner.\"<br />\nBut there are two problems with this line of reasoning. First, the $18,000 savings produced by the cut<br />\nwill amount to little more than a drop in the bucket<br />\nwhen added to general University funds. $18,000<br />\nisn't even enough to provide for one new faculty<br />\nappointment. The loss of that amount, augmented as<br />\nit inevitably 'will be by the pinch of inflation, will<br />\nhave a much more direct impact on students. Certainly more people would benefit from the lost opportunities in their extracurricular lives than from one<br />\nadditional professor in some department.<br />\nAccording to Fink's letter, \"it is our feeling that<br />\nconservative spending for activities is more appropriate than cuts to the academics for which tuition is<br />\nmuch needed.\" We disagree. The most valuable<br />\nexperiences we as students have available while we're<br />\nat Johns Hopkins are not to be obtained in any<br />\nclassroom format. They are rather the things we do to<br />\noccupy and entertain ourselves when we are not<br />\nstudying and the people we meet here along the way.<br />\nMemories of participation in organized group activities will endure long after we have forgotten how a<br />\nconsumer indifference curve is shaped.<br />\nCertainly Fink's efforts to prevent waste in SAC<br />\ngroups are good. We just feel that the fiscal squeeze<br />\non organizations may end up choking the student life<br />\nto death.<br /><br />\nfollowing the enactment of<br />\nhandgun control legislation, the<br />\nraw numbers (i.e., people killed<br />\nby handguns per year) will<br />\ndecline proportionally to the<br />\ndecrease in the pool of handguns. To put it on a more<br />\npersonal level, your odds of<br />\nsurvival improve. Therefore, the<br />\npool of handguns should be<br />\nreduced by legislation similar to<br />\nthat introduced by Representative Abner Mikva, banning the<br />\nsale of handguns and setting a<br />\nbounty on handguns that are<br />\nturned over to police.<br />\nOne final comment. Mr.<br />\nKnox used as evidence to<br />\nsupport possession of handguns<br />\nthe \"fact\" that even though he<br />\nhas had a loaded handgun in his<br />\nhouse for \u2022as long as he can<br />\nrecall, his 4 children were never<br />\nharmed by the gun. All I can<br />\nsay to that is \"Well Mr. Knox,<br />\nyou beat the odds, it's too bad<br />\nthat all handgun owners don't<br />\nhave your lucky streak\".<br /><br />\nGuns<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nCongratulations and thanks<br />\nto Mike WallIc'and the rest of the<br />\nofficers of the Freshman Class<br />\nfor putting together the informative and evocative handgun<br />\ncontrol debate last Tuesday<br />\nnight. The Bronx cheer award<br />\ngoes to the large number of<br />\nHopkins students who failed to<br />\nbe present. The sparse crowd,<br />\nand the small number of Hopkins students in the crowd are<br />\nsymptomatic of the unhealthy<br />\napathy which this camp:Is has<br />\nfor serious issues that face our<br />\nsociety (as\" compared to the<br />\nexcitement for a recent humanitarian non-issue).<br />\nDuring the debate, I was<br />\namazed at the ability of Mr.<br />\nKnox, the representative from<br />\nthe National Rifle Association,<br />\nto cook up \"loads of meaningless statistics, and then to distort<br />\nthese 'facts' to support his<br />\nargument. His favorite \"fact\"<br />\nwas that<br />\n\" 99.48% of all<br />\nhandguns are not used in crime<br />\neach year\". Therefore, according<br />\nto Mr. Knox, handgun control<br />\nlaws should control the 0.5%<br />\nwho misuse their handguns and<br />\nnot the law abiding 99.5%.<br />\nHis \"facts\" may be correct,<br />\nbut his argument is errant.<br />\nAlthough the percentage of<br />\nmisuse may remain constant<br /><br />\nSincerely,<br />\nDarf Pierson<br /><br />\nT'd Off<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe Rip-Off of the Week!<br />\nAfter puzzling long over the sign<br />\nabove six boxes of fancy teas (in<br />\nindividually-wrapped foil packages -- all the same size), I asked<br />\nthe manager of the Levering<br />\nfood service for an explanation.<br />\nThe sign read:<br />\n.30<br />\nsmall<br /><br />\n.40<br />\nmedium<br /><br />\n.50<br />\nlarge<br /><br />\nHe explained that the price<br />\ndepended on the size cup you<br />\nused, and that even though<br />\nthe teabags were the same size,<br />\nand all you did was fill the cup,<br />\nSincerely, whatever size, with Hot water,<br />\nSaul A.

As a result, premiums<br />\nfor the student group could be<br />\ncut significantly.<br />\nWorking independently of<br />\nGodenne, the student committee<br />\nis studying a plan under which<br />\nthe students would pay premiums to the University and<br />\nthen be reimbursed for medical<br />\nexpenses by Hopkins. That<br />\ncommittee will present its proposals to Godenne, who will<br />\nthen recommend to the administration the plan she considers<br />\nbest suited to the needs of the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nNothing has yet been shown<br />\nto Dean Hall, so there probably<br />\nwill not be time this year to do<br />\nall of the research required<br />\nbefore either plan could be<br />\napproved. Both plans would<br />\nprovoke \"a great deal of discussion.\" Hall said, \"I would<br />\nquestion the feasability of a fee<br />\nat this time (before a study of its<br />\ncosts and benefits has been<br />\ndone).\" He also doubted whether the University would have<br />\nlarge enough financial reserves<br />\nunder a self-insurance plan to<br />\ncover long and expensive illnesses.<br />\nBoth Dr. Godenne and the<br />\ncommittees have met with Samuel Shriver, a representative of<br />\nMcDonald-Shriver Associates, an<br />\ninsurance brokerage,to discuss<br />\nthe options available and the<br />\ncosts of those options. McDonald-Shriver is interested in<br />\ndesigning a health insurance<br />\npolicy for the University.<br />\nThe problem with Blue<br />\nCross/Blue Shield is twofold,<br />\naccording to Carlton Haywood,<br />\nchairman of the student committee. The premiums are high-$212.12, more than twice as<br />\nmuch as they were when the<br />\nplan was started three years<br />\nago-and the coverage is inadequate. \"The Blue Cross policy<br />\nis shot full of exceptions and<br />\nlimitations. They'll give you<br />\n$100 a day for a semiprivate<br />\nroom, but you can't get a<br />\nsemiprivate room for $100 a day<br />\nin Baltimore.\"<br />\nGodenne believes that the<br />\nhigh cost of health insurance at<br />\nHopkins is a result of the zero<br />\ndeductible clause. \"What I<br />\nwould like to do is to get every<br />\nstudent to pay a health services<br />\nfee, and then have a medical<br />\ninsurance plan with a very high<br />\ndeductible.\" The total cost of<br />\nsuch a package, she said, would<br />\nbe less than the amount students<br />\npay now in premiums. She hopes<br />\nto hold the total cost of premium and fee to $150.<br />\nHaywood agreed that a<br />\nhealth fee might be a good idea,<br />\nbut he added,\"If the people are<br />\ngoing to pay for health services,<br /><br />\nwe want to see that the University provides those services.\"<br />\nHis committee is investigating a plan under which \"in<br />\neffect, Hopkins insures the student.\" Students would pay premiums into a pool administered<br />\nby the University, and then<br />\nHopkins would pay the students'<br />\nbills from the funds in that pool.<br />\nThat plan would not save<br />\nstudents much money in premiums--in fact, it could cost<br />\neven more than the present<br />\nplan--but it would offer better<br />\ncoverage, said Haywood. \"What<br />\nbothers me is that most people<br />\ndon't realize they're really not<br />\nprotected by insurance. If they<br />\nget sick, it's going to cost them a<br />\nbundle.\"<br />\nThe committee's plan would<br />\nlimit student liability. Under one<br />\nproposal being considered, the<br />\nstudent would pay the first<br />\n$100, and would be covered for<br /><br />\n80% of the next $2000 and for<br />\n100% of all expenses after that.<br />\n\"The most that students would<br />\npay would be $500, plus the<br />\ncost of the policy,\" he said.<br />\nThe committee is not limiting itself to an investigation of<br />\nalternative health insurance<br />\nplans. According to Haywood,<br />\nthe group is \"looking at all the<br />\nhealth services\" offered by Hopkins, including the White House<br />\nand Brown Infirmary.<br />\nThe committee is also looking into the possibility of having<br />\nfree or subsidized medication<br />\nprovided by Brown Infirmary.<br />\nThe committee got its start<br />\nlast summer when students approached Tom Schmith with<br />\ncomplaints about the cost of<br />\nhealth insurance. Schmith helped them organize, provided<br />\ninformation about health insurance plans and arranged the<br />\nmeeting with Shriver.<br /><br />\nDirector of Student Services Tom Schmith<br /><br />\nTHE STROH BREWERY COMPANY, DETROIT, MICHIGAN<br /><br />\nREGISTRATION DESKS<br />\n9Nit4t4ING<br /><br />\nRPWIN6J SAIUN&amp;<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nSTRONING<br /><br />\nStudy<br />\nin Italy<br />\nthis Summer<br />\nBARBIERI CENTER/ROME CAMPUS<br /><br />\nJUNE 15 - JULY 25 \u2014 $995<br />\n\u2022Music<br />\nArt History<br />\nSocial Science<br />\nItalian<br />\nClassical Civilization<br /><br />\nYet<br /><br />\nBarbieri Center/Rome Campus<br /><br />\nTRINITY COLLEGE<br /><br />\nFor the real beer lover.<br /><br />\nHartford, Conn. 06106<br /><br />\n*ir<br /><br />\n19711<br /><br />\nPAGE 6 MARCH 16 1979<br />\nTHERE a A DIFFERENCE!!<br /><br />\n100 E. 33rd Street<br />\nIn the Bradford Apts.<br />\n(Entrance: 33rd Street)<br /><br />\nAIR CUTTING &amp; DESIGN<br />\nFOR MEN &amp; WOMEN<br /><br />\n\nPresented by The Johns Hopkins University Office of Special Events<br /><br />\n\"A MUSICAL APPROACH TO HUMAN<br />\nSEXUALITY AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH<br />\nIN EDUCATION\"<br />\nWith EQUINOX - A group of educators who write and record<br />\nsongs for educational purposes.<br /><br />\nJUST 1 BLOCK FROM CAMPUS!<br />\nOPEN<br /><br />\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 21 - NOON<br />\nGarrett Room, Milton S.

Rourke has received a<br />\n$61,000 grant from the Russell<br />\nSage Foundation to study the<br />\nproblems bureaucratic autonomy presents for Presidential<br />\nleadership.<br />\nRourke plans to explore the<br />\nways in which the cleavage<br />\nbetween the White House and<br />\nexecutive agencies nominally<br />\nunder its jurisdiction has caused<br />\nPresidents difficulty in achieving<br />\ntheir policy goals. The difficulties, Rourke says, are often as<br />\ngreat as those present in Presidents' relations with the constitutuionally independent Congress.<br />\nHis research will focus on<br />\nrelations between the White<br />\nHouse and the Department of<br />\nLabor and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)<br />\nduring the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and Richard<br />\nNixon. Rourke says the two<br />\norganizations represent the principal institutional structures--a<br />\ncabinet department and an independent regulatory committee--with which the White House<br />\nshares power in the executive<br />\nbranch.<br />\nThe Labor Department, he<br />\nsays, typifies the strongly entrenched constituency agency,<br />\none deriving independence from<br />\nits close ties to external pressure<br />\ngroups\u2014in this case trade unions.<br />\nThe White House frequently sees<br />\nsuch agencies as serving narrow<br />\ninterests and the President as<br />\nrepresenting the broad public<br />\ninterest.<br />\nAccording to Rourke, constituency agencies themselves<br />\nfeel they prevent major population groups from being neglected when executive policy<br />\n\u2022 decisions are made. They also<br />\nsecure from those groups a kind<br />\nof support and cooperation that<br />\nmay be indispensable in implementing Presidential policy<br /><br />\ndecisions.<br />\nRourke chose Presidents<br />\nJohnson and Nixon because<br />\nboth men were in office long<br />\nenough to have an impact on<br />\nWhite House staff operations<br />\nand relationships between the<br />\nWhite House and the rest of the<br />\nexecutive branch. Since Johnson<br />\nwas a Democrat and Nixon a<br />\nRepublican, he says, he will also<br />\nbe able to study whether the<br />\npolitical coloration of the White<br />\nHouse affects its relationships<br />\nwith the executive bureaucracy.<br />\nIn conducting his research,<br />\nDr. Rourke will rely on archival<br />\nmaterial and oral interviews with<br />\nofficials in - those administrations. He says his research<br />\nhas implications for understanding agencies similar to the<br />\nDepartment of Labor and the<br />\nFCC.<br />\nHe says the bureaucratic<br />\nindependence of regulatory<br />\ncommissions rests on legal rather<br />\nthan political foundations.<br />\n\"Independent<br />\nregulatory<br />\nagencies like the Federal Communications<br />\nCommission,\"<br />\nRourke says, \"are set up by<br />\nstatutes which seek to guarantee<br />\nthat they will be free from any<br />\nongoing kind of Presidential<br />\nsupervision.\"<br />\nThat independence provides<br />\ncontinuity in development of<br />\npolicy from one administration<br />\nto another.

And it happens once<br />\nevery 20 minutes.<br />\n554 rapes--one to three<br />\nevery day--were reported in<br />\nBaltimore last year. Four to ten<br />\ntimes as many unreported rapes<br />\nmay have been committed. They<br />\noccurred in every neighborhood,<br />\nduring the day and, most often,<br />\nat night. 9% took place in<br />\ncars, 3% in parks or schools, 24%<br />\nin the streets and 54% in the<br />\nvictims' homes.

And while the<br />\npercentage of most other crimes<br />\ndeclined last year, the incidence<br />\nof rapes rose 5% nationally.<br />\nStudents and women faculty members at a university<br />\nconstitute a high percentage of<br />\nrape victims. Many women at<br />\nHopkins come from smaller<br />\ntowns and are unused to coping<br />\nwith crime in a big city. Because<br />\nthey live alone, women take<br />\nrisks they ordinarily would<br />\navoid, and are exposed to<br />\ndangers which they might not<br />\nface at home.<br />\nYet, there are things women<br />\ncan do to protect their homes<br />\nand themselves--easy, common<br /><br />\nsense measures that might be<br />\nenough to deter a rapist.

Keep a confident,<br />\ndetermined expression on your<br />\nface. Glance around as you walk<br />\nto anticipate possible threats--a<br />\ncruising car, a dark alley.

The correct term is<br />\nsinistral. If that word does bad things for<br />\nyou, well, I'm sorry, but it's just because<br />\ncenturies of societies controlled by right-handers have managed to vilify us in every way they<br />\npossibly could. They call us looney, backward, awkward<br />\nand retarded, no matter what language they use. So<br />\nwhen they say to be sinister means to be spooky and<br />\nevil, why deny it? They're really only afraid of what<br />\nthey can't understand.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWell, Maybe we do have a duty to help them out a<br />\nlittle. Lefthandedness is a phenomenon poorly understood not only by your average Joe Righthander, but<br />\neven by so-called experts in the field. Not that it isn't an<br />\nintriguing subject--for centuries men have speculated and<br />\nwondered why the right should have come to consider<br />\nitself \"the master hand,\" as an author named Abram<br />\nBlau aptly put it in the title to his book on the subject.<br />\nFirst advanced in the \"modern\" period was the<br />\nvisceral dominance explanation. Supposedly espoused by<br />\nSir Francis Bacon, this theory holds that people are<br />\nmore adept and stronger on the right because the organs<br />\nof the human body are heavier on that side. Alexander<br />\nBuchanan, a Professor of Physiology at the University of<br />\nGlasgow, added the weight of learning to this argument<br />\nwhen he declared, \"With the greater weight of the liver<br />\nand lungs on the right, man tends to be able to balance<br />\nbetter on the left foot, leaving the right hand free and<br />\nready for action, and in time the muscles on the .right<br />\nside develop more strongly.\"<br /><br />\nU<br /><br />\nPersecution oflefties was rampant in the Twenties.,<br />\nLiter in the 19th century, followers of Darwin got<br />\ninto the act by postulating evolutionary reasons for the<br />\ndominance of the right hand. Ancient warriors, they<br />\nargued, carried their shields in their left hands in order<br />\nto better protect their hearts (on the left side). This left<br />\nonly the right arm free to wield the sword,so in time the<br />\ndextrally-gifted came to conquer all of civilization.<br />\nSuch theories have persisted in the 20th century. A<br />\nresearcher named W. Franklin Jones took elaborate<br />\nmeasurements of the arm bones and muscles of 20,000<br />\nsubjects aged one month to 101 years in order to establish that right-handers have longer, thicker right than left<br />\narms, and sinistrals the other way around. He also<br />\nthought 15,000,000 of the 20,000,000 cases of spinal<br />\ncurvature in the country were caused because schoolchildren had to crane their necks in order to see what<br />\nthey were writing with their right eye, and urged that all<br />\nschool desks be tilted at a 45-degree angle. If these ideas<br />\nsound a bit crazy, it's probably because left-handers<br />\ncame up with most of them.<br />\nortunately there are some more solid points<br />\nwhich can be made about handedness. Most<br />\nstriking is the predominance of right-handers<br />\nthroughout all of history and across every<br />\nculture. Cro-Magnon men who traced their<br />\nown silhouettes on rocks almost always did so with their<br />\nright hands; we know because only the left.hands are<br />\ndepicted in the drawings.. Curiously enough, however,<br />\napes show no sign whatsoever of consistent hand prefer-<br /><br />\nF<br /><br />\nence in manual tasks. This seems good enough evidence<br />\nto show that handedness, left and right, must be somehow contained in the human genetic structure, passed on<br />\nthrough heredity. Numerous studies have attempted to<br />\nprove this link, and to establish some model to explain<br />\nexactly how it works, but they invariably run afoul of<br />\none embarrassing piece of data: the majority of lefthanded people have two right-handed parents, while<br />\neven marriages between two left-handers generally<br />\nproduce right-handed children. In view of this situation,<br />\nsome theorists have proposed that there is no such thing<br />\nas biologically-inherited handedness at all, but that most<br />\npeople are simply socialized into dextrality through<br />\ncontact with a right-handed world. It has been shown<br />\nquite well that children are frequently induced by social<br />\nforces to become right-handed even when they have a<br />\nnatural sinistral inclination. But the theory still doesn't<br />\nexplain why some people are so stubbornly left-handed<br />\neven in the face of all kinds of pressure. So the best<br />\nmodern hypotheses incorporate some hereditary inclination plus environmental factors as conditions for determining a person's handedness.<br />\nOne fine theory which fits all the cultural data has<br />\nbeen politely overlooked by all the experts, however. To<br />\nput it as nicely as possible, there was once a time when<br />\nMr. Scott &amp; Co. didn't make their soft, fluffy stuff with<br />\npretty flowers all over it. But even then, people needed<br />\nto clean themselves. So they used what was available.<br />\nEven if there was cloth around, it got dirty in a hurry,<br />\nand what's more, there weren' t any handy taps with<br />\nrunning water to wash with afterward, either. So naturally the hand used for the, task was stigmatized as dirty.<br />\nSince people tend to favor the right hand anyway in<br />\ntheir daily tasks, the left was left with the onerous duty.<br />\nYou may not believe this story, but even to this day<br />\nthere are strict taboos against eating or writing with the<br />\nleft hand throughout Africa and in all the Arab countries. The natives there get extremely upset at anybody<br />\nwho attempts to do so, even rich Americans who carry<br />\ntoilet paper in their valises.<br />\nEstimates regarding the incidence of sinistrality<br />\nhave varied widely due to the number of ways in which<br />\nit can be measured. Everybody knows about handedness,<br />\nbut did you know that you are also right- or left-eyed?<br />\nTo find out which, take this simple test. Look at any<br />\nnearby object--then slowly cover one eye. If the object<br />\nsuddenly appears to move, then your eyedness is on the<br />\nside of the eye you just covered. Try it--you might be<br />\nsuprised, for left-eyed people aren't always left-handed.<br />\nThen there are other measures, all of which have been<br />\nused: footedness, earedness and even fingeredness. But<br />\nthe preferred hand used for tasks like eating and writing<br />\nis considered the best indicator of laterality. Using this<br />\ncriterion, no reliable study has ever found the percentage<br />\nof left-handers in the population to be higher than 12%,<br />\nwith one exception. Among groups of mental defectives,<br />\nsinistrals are usually found in proportions of well over<br />\n20%. Perhaps this explains why just over a third(13 out<br />\nof 38) of the people on the News-Letter staff are lefthanders.<br />\nhen again, if we try hard enough maybe we<br />\ncan dig up some other factors. Lefthandedness, though it has not yet reached epidemic<br />\nproportions, is clearly on the rise in America. According to Dr.Jarre Levy, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the<br />\nforemost authorities on laterality today, \"In the United<br />\nStates the frequency of sinistrality as measured by the<br />\nwriting hand increased monotonically with a negatively<br />\naccelerated slope from 2.2% in 1932 to 11.1% by 1972.\"<br />\nA 1976 survey supported this assertion when it found<br />\nthat the proportion of sinistrals rises from 2.9% among<br />\n60-year-olds to 10.8% among people born since 1956.<br />\nThis increase has resulted from an increased tolerance of left-handers by our society, particularly in<br />\nthe primary school environment. During the first<br />\nyears of our century, it was a common therapy for a<br />\nchild who showed a tendency to write with his left hand<br />\nto tie his left arm behind his back until he learned\u2022to use<br />\nhis right hand. The few who managed to survive as<br />\nleft-handers were looked upon as misfits and deviants.<br /><br />\nThis, incidentally, may help explain why young George<br />\nHerman \"Babe\" Ruth was seen as a delinquent and<br />\nbanished to a Baltimore reform school at the tender age<br />\nof seven. While today's undergraduates may be skeptical<br />\nabout these past outrages, some older citizens can recall<br />\nthose infamous days well, although they don't like much<br />\nto talk about it. \"We're a lot more tolerant in the<br />\nschools today than we were some years ago, and there's<br />\none reason why,\" says Dr. Harry M. Robinson, an<br />\nelderly physician who practices in the Homewood area.<br />\n\"Making a child who's naturally left-handed write with<br />\nhis right hand builds up frustration in the child, and<br />\nmakes him feel like he's not normal. So it has quite a<br />\nharmful effect.\"<br />\nA recent survey of 85 students at Johns Hopkins<br />\nbears out the claim that young people are growing more<br />\nleft-handed. Slightly over 15% were found to be lefthanded, which again is higher than any other reported<br />\nfigure for a group of \"normal\" subjects. The survey also<br />\nrevealed something about the personality of a Hopkins<br />\nleft-hander: he or she is not your typical pre-med.<br />\nWhile more than half(37 of 72)of the dextrals contacted in the study were natural science area majors, only 2<br /><br />\nCoup d'etat: The leftist Editor and his southpaw crftes<br />\nof the 13 left-handers were concentrating in such a field.<br />\nThis helps show why over a third of the students in<br />\nmany humanities courses such as Emily Dickinson<br />\nseminars and Histories of 17th Century France can be<br />\nobserved in class writing with their left hands.<br />\nIt also fits well with the clinical evidence which has<br />\nbeen adduced to show that sinistrals are more creative--or at least think differently--than other people.<br />\nThese speculations all rest on the much-vaunted \"cerebral dominance\" theory of laterality. This view holds<br />\nthat the left side of the body is controlled by the right<br />\nside of the brain, and the left side of the body by the<br />\nleft side of the brain. Dextrals have \"dominant\" left<br />\nhemispheres, while sinistrals have dominant right hemispheres. Since the left hemisphere contains the principal<br />\nspeech center and the right hemisphere is more abstract,<br />\nleft-handers are admitted to be somewhat more creative<br />\nthan right-handers, but then, their reading and language<br />\nskills have been correspondingly maligned.<br />\nA mountain of research has been done to check and<br />\nexpand this hypothesis, and some interesting results<br />\nhave emerged. For example, one experiment using<br />\nmirror-images of the same vacation slides viewed by both<br />\nright and left-handers showed that right-handers prefer-<br /><br />\nnit!<br /><br />\nt.rif ORMENACE7<br />\n****-* **** k*****<br /><br />\nis<br />\nre<br /><br />\n;o<br />\nis<br />\nd.<br />\nt2<br /><br />\nred pictures with \"important\" features on the right side,<br />\nwhile the sinistral subjects liked the mirror-images<br />\nof the same slides better. As a result of some of these<br />\nstudies, a few changes have been made in the basic<br />\ncerebral dominance model. It is now believed that<br />\nleft-handedness does not imply right-side brain dominance, but rather a more general operation involving<br />\nboth halves about equally. This explains why sinistrals<br />\nhave a considerably greater tendency to do some things<br />\nright-handed and more frequently consider themselves<br />\nambidextrous than do dextrals.<br />\nAnother proposal based on a battery of tests administered by Levy contends that only some left-handers<br />\nhave the \"creative\" brain structure attributed to them<br />\nby the dominance theory, and that a few right-handers<br />\nhave it also. The way you tell, according to Levy, is to<br />\nlook at the way you write. If you are left-handed, and<br />\nyou hold the pen below the line you are writing on, then<br />\nyou are a \"creative.\" But if you hold it above the line,<br />\nPointing toward the bottom of the page, then you really<br />\nstill have a regular old right-handed brain. Now if you're<br />\nright-handed, and do it the first way, you're a \"normal,\"<br />\nbut if you hold the pen above the line, you're a \"crea-<br /><br />\npaw cronies celebrate successful Gatehouse power grab.<br /><br />\nId.<br />\nin<br /><br />\nbe<br /><br />\nLas<br />\natle.<br /><br />\nds<br />\nJit<br />\nhe<br />\n!ft<br /><br />\n)al<br /><br />\nye<br />\nge<br /><br />\ntive.\" At least one piece of evidence in support of this<br />\n\u00b0pinion can be found in noted News-Letter scribe<br />\nCates Baldridge, a right-hander who holds his pen in a<br />\nfunny way above the line he is writing. While you might<br />\nnot like the stuff Mr. Baldridge dreams up, you have to<br />\nadmit he is one of the more creative creatures around<br />\nthis University.<br />\nBecause left-handers have a more general brain<br />\nfunction than right-handers, they have a much better<br />\nrecord of surviving strokes and other forms of brain<br />\ndamage with little harm. Some scientists have tried to<br />\nsuggest that this makes them evolutionarily stronger<br />\nthan right-handers, and that eventually left-handers<br />\nWill take over the world. Whether for this or for some<br />\nOther reason, right-handed societies have always tended<br />\nto. view sinistrals darkly. Maybe they think we're not<br />\ngoing to wait that long.<br /><br />\nIts<br />\nng<br />\nth<br />\ngarage<br /><br />\nt is a little-known fact that left-handed<br />\nwriting is officially forbidden in the Soviet<br />\nUnion, East Germany, and five other Eastern<br />\nEuropean countries. Yet when has President<br />\nCarter ever made one protest against this<br />\nin all his talk about human rights? Since when<br /><br />\nhas it been a key stumbling block to the completion of<br />\nthe SALT talks, or even to a few measly machinery<br />\nshipments? Never. This sweeping under the rug of the<br />\nplight of millions of innocent people we must protest as<br />\nmanifest evidence of the hypocrisy of U.S. foreign<br />\npolicy. But as for the offending governments\u2014they are<br />\njust hurting themselves. Jones (the guy who measured<br />\narms) found in his group of 20,000 people that 75% of<br />\nthe ones who stuttered had been forced to write with<br />\ntheir right hand even though they were naturally left-handed. If Mr. Edward Gierek wants to have a bunch of<br />\nstammering Polocks on his hands, then so be it. But look<br />\nat the positive side, at the marvels that are lost if sinistrals are repressed. Of the greatest men and women in<br />\nalmost every field of endeavor, about half are invariably<br />\nleft-handed. Which is kind of a left-handed way of<br />\nsaying: Left is not Ludicrous; Left is Luscious. Witness<br />\nKim Novak and Marilyn Monroe.<br />\nAnd in sports--man, in sports, are the southpaws<br />\nsuper! Both today's stars and the heroes of the past have<br />\nbeen left-handed in proportions nowhere close to this<br />\n10% business. In basketball, there's Bill Walton and John<br />\nLucas, and if you look to the past, there stands the<br />\nmammoth spectre of Bill Russell. And southpaw excellence is by no means limited to Americans. True, Jimmy<br />\nConnors of Bellevue, Illinois is one of the very best<br />\ntennis players in the world, but so is Argentinian<br />\nGuillermo Vilas. And some say the left-handed Aussie<br />\nRod Laver was the best who ever lived. Actually, one of<br />\nhis countrymen by the name of Ken Rosewall might<br />\nhave actually become the undisputed greatest, but in his<br />\nyouth he was made to switch from his left to his right<br />\nhand. Though he had ground strokes good enough to<br />\nwin him 'many matches against Laver, his serve always<br />\nremained a weak spot, a fact he always attributed to<br />\nhis play with the \"wrong\" hand. Even in soccer, sinistrals are currently enjoying a period of splendour. The<br />\ntwo leading scorers in last summer's World Cup competition were Mario Kempes of Argentina and Robby<br />\nRensenbrink of Holland, both left-footed.<br />\nThen there's baseball. Ron Guidry, Reggie Jackson--what can we say? What haven't left-handers done in<br />\nbaseball? Play catcher, that's one thing from which<br />\nthey've been absolutely excluded. And second. And<br />\nshort. But the man acclaimed as the greatest third-baseman of all time was a left-hander. That's right,Baltimore'<br />\nBrooks Robinson. Brooks eats, writes, and does everything else except throw a baseball with his left hand. He<br />\nnever had a particularly strong throwing arm as a player--but the things he could do with his left gloved hand,<br />\nnobody else could match.<br />\nLeft-handers have also achieved greatness in more<br />\nsignificant fields. Alexander the Great and Charlemagne,<br />\nfor example. Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx. Ringo<br />\nStarr and Paul McCartney. Then there's the most notorious of all\u2014in 1888, the coroner's inquest into the brutal<br />\nstabbing death of a prostitute named Martha Turner<br />\nofficially established that her assailant, popularly dubbed \"Jack the Ripper,\" wielded the weapon with his left<br />\nhand.<br />\nut while left-handers seem well-suited for<br />\nsuch great callings, they frequently run into<br />\ndifficulty when they try to lead a more<br />\nmundane life. Even as they enter the world,<br />\n\u2022they are already forced to follow a rougher<br />\nroad than their dextral counterparts. A questionnaire<br />\nstudy done in 1973 found that left-handed college<br />\nstudents reported more parental accounts of stressful<br />\nbirths. Then, when they get a bit older and people find<br />\nout about them being left-handed, they immediatley<br />\na bit daffy. Let's put it this way: how<br />\nget labeled<br />\nmany people do you know who are familiarly referred to<br />\nas Righty? Admittedly, Vernon Preston Gomez, known<br />\nas Lefty when he pitched for the Yankees 40 years ago,<br />\ndid little to help matters when he suddenly stopped in<br />\nthe middle of an inning on the pitcher's mound to stare<br />\nfor several minutes at an airplane passing overhead. And<br />\nthe last left-handed President with whom we were<br />\nblessed, namely Gerald Ford, also did his share to mess<br />\nup our public relations with his weekly stumblings and<br />\nbumpings of the head upon descent from airplanes.<br /><br />\nB<br /><br />\nIn some vocations, however,left-handers have worse<br />\ndisadvantages than a flaky reputation. A left-handed<br />\ncarpenter faces a choice between severing his sinistrality<br />\non the job or severing several fingers' with an electric<br />\nsaw. Almost every-device which can possibly be designed<br />\nfor right-handers is made that way. Cars, in particular,<br />\nwith pedals to be operated mostly by the right foot and<br />\ngears to be shifted with the right hand, are stubborn<br />\nobstacles to be surmounted by would-be sinistral drivers.<br />\nLadles, scissors and can openers are all ingeniously<br />\nintended for right-handed use. Fountain pens are usually<br />\nsmudge city for southpaws, but there is a way: hold the<br />\npaper with the left edge slanting upward, and lean<br />\nyour writing back to the left. You might have to learn to<br />\nwrite all over again, though, so it's fortunate that Baron<br />\nMarcel Bich had the kindness to bring us his ball point<br />\npen, which works fine for left-handers.<br />\nAt the table, left-handers have even more problems.<br />\nFirst of all, whenever they sit to the right of a regular<br />\nperson, the two wind up rubbing elbows, which can be<br />\nembarrassing unless the guy sitting next to you is Henry<br />\nKissinger. Silverware is always set up backwards for<br />\nleft-handers--especially in the best places. And worst of<br />\nall is when you get one of those mugs with a neat<br />\nlittle picture on the front. When you hold it in your left<br />\nhand, you never can see the damned thing!,\u201e.<br /><br />\nThe sinistralist today...<br />\nEmerging from the closet,<br />\nRreaking the chains of history.<br /><br />\nn order to combat these iniquities and to<br />\nhelp people cope in the meantime, we've<br />\nformed a new organization right here at<br />\nJohns Hopkins called The Party of the Left.<br />\nOur founder and first candidate for President, the noted intellectual Howard Kaplan, pledged in<br />\nhis initial speech that \"Our aims shall be totally sinister,\" although he welcomed any disillusioned Marxists<br />\nwho might care to join.\"No longer will we be content to<br />\nsit still while the rest of the country hands us the leftovers..,\" Kaplan proclaimed as he concluded his fiery<br />\nexhortation. Already, The Party of the Left has worked<br />\nbehind the scenes to persuade the Bookcenter to carry<br />\nleft-handed notebooks.

It was originally conceived as a<br />\nfair way to service the housing needs of the undergraduate, graduate, and transfer student community.<br />\nThe system as it exists now, however, is bogged down in<br />\nsuch bureaucratic red tape, and administrative dogmatism, that it succeeds only in discouraging the freshmen<br />\nand transfer students from using its resources.<br />\nThe lottery is an excellent example of how a good<br />\nidea can be turned into a bad reality. I was sitting<br />\ncomfortably at home on the seventh floor of Wolman<br />\nHall watching a T.V. news report about foreign refugees.<br />\nSuddenly, my roommate came running into my room.<br />\n\"They're going to throw you out,\" he screamed.<br />\n\"What?\" I said in total surprise. \"Who? Who's going to<br />\nthrow me out? Of where?\" I said. \"The building.<br />\nHousing is tossing you out of the building.\" Just then<br />\nhe- handed me an ominous looking sheet of paper.<br />\nWritten near the top, in brazen blue lettering, were the<br />\nwords, \"Notice of Housing Lottery Information<br />\nSession.\"<br />\n\"I won't let them take you alive!\"i Joe screamed.<br />\n\"We can fight this! We'll lock'em out!\"<br /><br />\n\"It was weeks before the police found Herman and<br />\nhis van,\" said Steve. \"It was parked in a Taco Bell<br />\nparking lot in Modesto, California. By then, it was past<br />\nmid-terms, and the semester was gone. Herman never<br />\ncame back to school after that. The last we heard from<br />\nhim, he had joined the Hari Krishnas, and was working<br />\nas a part-time insurance agent for the Good Hands<br />\nPeople.\"<br />\n\"Gee whiz,\" I said. \"I didn't know how important<br />\nthe lottery was. Imagine having to live in a metal cage in<br />\na garage like an animal.\"<br />\n\"Or worse,\" said Steve. \"Imagine becoming an<br />\ninsurance agent in Modesto, California.\"<br />\nThe next day, I went down to the housing office to<br />\nget the proper forms. After I filled out the multicolored slips I returned them to housing.<br />\nAbout a week later I went down to see about<br />\nmaking a change on one form. When I arrived I was<br />\nshocked to see a long snaking line worming its way down<br />\nthe hall, and out of sight into the corridor. At first I<br />\nthought it was some kind of outdoor club activity,<br />\nbut then I noticed that only a few people were carrying<br />\ntents. In an attempt to determine the line's real<br />\npurpose, I cautiously approached. \"Hello,\" I said.<br />\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Simultaneously, about a<br />\ndozen or so line members held up multi-colored housing<br />\nslips.<br />\n\"We're waiting to turn in our housing slips,\" said a<br />\ngirl.<br />\n\"Really,\" I said. \"Some of you really came well<br />\nprepared. How long have you been here?\"<br />\n\"Oh, you mean the sandwiches, and the thermos<br />\nbottles,\" said the girl.<br />\n\"Yes, that plus the ba:kpacks, and the blankets,\" I<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"Well,\" said the girl, \"you never know how long it<br />\nwill take to get something out of housing.\"<br />\nThe crowd was beginning to suspect me of line-cutting, so I thought that I should move on. \"Good luck,\"<br />\nI said. \"I just have to make a form change,so I'm going<br />\nto the front of the line.\" As quickly as I could I pushed<br />\nmy way through the crowd to the front.

It's a bit hard to see how Mork<br />\nand Mindy's popularity can be linked to<br />\nfears about Ayatollah Khomeini. Yes, I<br />\ndo know of the Zamora case where<br />\nlawyers argued that repeated exposure to<br />\nT.V. violence turned an ordinary young<br />\npunk into a murderer. The court rejected<br />\nthat argument. And yes, I have heard that<br />\nsome people feel that the Archie Bunker<br />\ncharacter encourages bigotry, but others<br />\nhave said that he ridicules it.

People<br />\nhave always liked sex and have always<br />\nliked to laugh at the foibles of ordinary<br />\ncharacters in order to make real life<br />\nproblems more bearable. Charlie's Angels<br />\nand Happy Days belong to a long line of<br />\nsimilar entertainment genres in all media.<br />\nSome might say that the greater<br />\nproportion of 'jiggly' and lidvid' than<br />\nin the past reflects American immaturity.<br />\nThis is probably incorrect. Censors have<br />\nbecome more discreetly tolerant, in line<br />\nwith post-Sixties passive and often<br />\nhypocritical acceptance of sexual impropriety. Meanwhile, the writers have<br /><br />\nbecome more adept at evading the<br />\ncensors. The only kidvid shows that have<br />\nsurvived; have been the comparatively<br />\nhigh quality ones (according to the<br />\npublic) such as Charlie's Angels and<br />\nHappy Days, however offensive they<br />\nmight be to some vieWers.

After a hard<br />\nday hitting the museums with Dr. Phoebe<br />\nStanton from the History of Art dept.<br />\nand assorted others, the more adventurous of the party frequented the night<br />\nspots which the city provided. At a more<br />\nor less renovated warehouse (appropriately called Dingwalls) Joe Jackson performed, complete with an audience<br />\ncomprised of the most bizarre London<br />\nhad to offer.<br />\nWhen Joe Jackson came on stage<br />\npurple haired heads and four inch spikes<br />\nbegan to move. But somehow, his music<br />\nwas slightly out of synch with the crowd<br />\nhe attracted. Jackson's appeal is more<br />\nwide-spread than the way out crowd.<br />\nAlthough the latest extension of the<br />\navant-garde in rock, Jackson's music<br />\nmoves beyond that nar=row realm.<br />\nAs even the titles of his songs imply,<br />\nhis album is about time. The first song,<br />\nOne More Time, carries this theme into<br />\nthe following selection, Sunday Papers.<br />\nMother's wheelchair stays out in the<br />\nhall<br />\nWhy should she go out when the<br />\nTV's on<br />\nWell, I ain't got nothing 'gainst the<br />\npress<br />\nThey wouldn't print if it it wasn't<br /><br />\ntrue.<br />\nJackson uses his lyrics to make commentaries not about timeless elements<br />\nsuch as love, death, and those things<br />\nwhich do not change, but rather precisely<br />\nthose things which are totally connected<br />\nwith the present.<br />\nThe title song, Look Sharp, cautions<br />\nthe listener to do just that, look and<br />\nlisten sharp. But not at the past or the<br />\nfuture, but at this point in time, right<br />\nnow.<br />\n\"Okay, what you say, tell me what<br />\nthey're wearing this year.\" The problem<br />\nof the universality of this album is in<br />\ndebate due to these close connections<br />\nwith the punk trend of which Jackson is<br />\nmost definately a part. However, Jackson<br />\npresents a style of music which does<br />\nnot have to be seen to provide the visual<br />\ninterpretation so necessary with the Sex<br />\nPistols. His music is fast, clean, and<br />\nbordering on the sterile, an approack<br />\nwhich appeals to the seventies as a whole,<br />\nand not simply to punk rock enthusiasts.<br />\nThe elemntal nature of the songs may be<br />\nthe result of a process initiated by the<br />\nearlier punk groups, but Joe Jackson has<br />\ncreated a music which surpasses the<br />\nnarrow confines from which it grew.<br />\n\u2014Christy Jo Anderson<br /><br />\nProgressive Music Festival<br />\nComes To Hopkins In April<br />\nRemember this date: April 7, 1979.<br />\nWhy? Because on April 7 Devid Allen and<br />\nGong will kick off their first U.S. tour at<br />\na progressive music festival in Baltimore<br />\n(that's right, Baltimore) at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University. Also appearing at the<br />\nfestivities will be Gilli Smyth's Mother<br />\nGong, Yochk'o Seffer's Neffesh Music<br />\nfrom France, and a jazz group from<br />\nIndianapolis named Maelstrom.<br />\nThe concert is sponsored by the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Fine Arts Committee, a<br />\nnon-profit student organization which has<br />\nbeen putting on concerts of new and<br />\nalternative musics at the University since<br />\nlast fall. The Gong Fest begins at 8:00<br />\np.m. in Shriver Hall on the University's<br />\nHomewood Campus. Tickets will be<br />\navailable at the Union Desk of the Student Union and at music stores in the<br />\narea.<br />\nAppearing at a solo concert the<br />\nfollowing night, April 8, will be the<br />\nBritish guitarist Fred Frith. This concert<br />\nwill take place in the 1-v room of Levering<br />\nHall at 10:30 p.m. Tickets are also on sale<br />\nfor this concert at the Union Desk.<br />\nThe beginnings of Gong can be<br />\ntraced back to Easter Sunday 1966, when<br />\nDaevid Allen fell into a trance state and<br />\nexperienced his first contact with a group<br />\nof master spirits working through him.<br />\nThese invisible intelligences he calls<br />\n\"Octave Doctors\" and the one with<br />\nwhom he works in particular was called<br />\nthe \"Switch Doctor.\"<br />\nAllen, an Australian by birth, if not<br />\nby inclination, left his native Melbourne<br />\nin 1960 never to return. During the early<br />\nsixties he was playing Ornette Coleman inspired jazz with Robert Wyatt, Hugh<br />\nHopper, and Mike Ratledge, but he<br />\ngravitated from Kent to Paris, where he<br />\nbecame involved with the beat Burroughs/Corso scene* and also met Gilli Smyth,<br />\nwho was similarly interested in poetry<br />\nreadings.<br />\nAfter a historic gig outside St.<br />\nTropez, playing the warm-up set before<br />\nthe presentation of the Picasso play le<br />\nDesir Attrape par la Aueue, Allen was<br />\nallegedly refused re-entry into England<br />\nand his association with the Soft Machine<br /><br />\ncame to an abrupt end. He returned to<br />\nParis and formed the first assemblage of<br />\nGong.<br />\nBesides being a pioneer of \"space-rock,\" the group literally incorporated a<br />\nmythology and cosmology which symbolized and structured Allen's vision of<br />\n1966. The planet Gong was his vision,<br />\npopulated by a bunch of cosmic cannabiscultivating devas called pothead pixies<br />\n(though Daevid frowns on dope these<br />\ndays). The mythology was staffed by a<br />\nvast cast of eccentric characters with<br />\nnames like Shakti Yoni, Zero the Hero,<br />\nBanana Ananda, Dingo Virgin, and<br />\nBloomdido Bad de Grass, many of<br />\nwhom were assumed and lived out by<br />\nmembers of the band and the corruhunity<br />\nthat was supported by constant tours.<br />\nBefore realizing his Neffesh Music<br />\n(neffesh being the Hebrew word for soul),<br />\nYochk'o Seffer was a member of various<br />\nFrench progressive groups during the<br />\nyears 1969-73, including ZAO and<br />\nMagma. His musical training goes back to<br />\nthe age of six. Hungarian by birth, at<br />\nsixteen he moved to Paris and continued<br />\nto study music at le Conservatoire de<br />\nParis. Yochk\" attributes his \"second<br />\nbirth\" to the creation of Neffesh Music in<br />\nof<br />\nMarch<br />\n1976.<br />\nThere are three Neffesh Music albums and<br />\na fourth soon to be released, with all<br />\ncompositions by Yochk'o Seffer. Recorded and live performances to date include<br />\nstring quartets, percussion and bass with<br />\nYochk'o playing self-made instruments<br />\nand all manner of woodwinds, pianos and<br />\nsynthesizers. His voice, at times overdubbed, reveals a musical medium of human<br />\nexpression with aural precision. It is more<br />\nthan an instrument: his unique vocals add<br />\na dimension that transcends the compositional intracacy in Neffesh Music.

The rock 'n' roll, rhythm<br />\n'n' blues quartet has carved itself a very<br />\nstrong reputation along the Eastern<br />\nseaboard - so strong, in fact, that when<br />\nGregg Allman decided to end his self-imposed musical exile, he did so by<br />\njamming in the few small clubs with this<br />\nvery band.

The<br />\nevidence drawn from more than 2300<br />\nstudies and reports on video violence<br />\noverwhelmingly corroborates his findings.<br />\nSpecific studies have shown that violence<br />\non television desensitizes children to<br />\nviolence in their lives and renders them<br />\nmuch more tolerant of it. If simulated<br />\nmurder on television becomes a common<br />\nsight, the kids down the street throwing<br />\nrocks at each other don't seem to be<br />\ndoing anything very shocking. Acceptance of violent behavior on the neighborhood scale may be expanded to the<br />\nacceptance of warlike behavior on a<br />\nworldwide scale. It is probably true that<br />\nwe will always have some wars, but<br />\nwhile we cannot control the behavior ,of<br />\nall the countries in this world, we can<br />\nalways retain a sensitivity to and an<br />\nabhorrence of violent behavior.

Dan<br />\nAckroyd's routine open address of Jane<br />\nCurtin as \"You ignorant slut\" during the<br />\nPoint/Counterpoint segment is indeed<br />\ncrude and silly, but the real version on<br />\nSixty Minutes is even more so.

It is meant to stir and<br />\nexcite people. It may even exhaust or<br />\nfrustrate the listener. Many people react<br />\nnegatively when they encounter this in<br />\nmusic; yet it is the same kind of stimulation they go to the theater or read a book<br />\nfor. Taka-i-ki is a group that addresses<br />\nitself to those who consider music to be<br />\nmuch more than a tranquilizer. Presented<br />\nby the JHU Fine Arts Committee on<br />\nMarch 10, 'they played dynamic and<br />\nadventurous jazz revealing diverse influences as well as obvious originality.<br />\nTaka-i-ki consists of George Bishop<br />\non soprano and tenor sax and clarinet<br />\nSteve Buchanan on alto sax, Elliot Levin<br />\non soprano and tenor saxes and flutes,<br />\nand Rick Innacone on electric guitar.<br />\nFunctioning as a well-coordinated group,<br />\nthese four musicians displayed an ability<br />\nto understand and react to each other<br />\neven in fast, complex improvisations<br />\nwhen a three-saxophone-combination<br />\nmight easily lose coherence. The range of<br />\nsounds coaxed from the instruments was<br />\ntremendously varied. Saxophones went<br />\nfrom rasping, breathy dirges to gutteral<br />\nexplosions to heavy pulsating vibrato.<br />\nThrough \"overblowing,\" the registers of<br />\nthe tenor might be extended into soprano<br />\nand the soprano blown into a screeching<br />\nfury, while through split tones, harmonic<br />\npatterns could be extended. Sometimes<br />\nthe sound was reminiscent of Terry<br />\nRiley's smooth developments; at other<br />\ntimes it called to mind the swirling<br />\nmixtures of Albert Ayler or Pharoah<br />\nSanders. Innacone's guitar, augmented by<br /><br />\nan array of electronic treatment devices,<br />\ncould produce sweeping infinite sustains,<br />\nreverberating oscillations, and many unusual \"electronic\" sounds. Often he was<br />\nresponsible for maintaining an ostinato<br />\nwhile the reeds improvised; he also<br />\nentered directly into improvisations,<br />\nadding another pattern or simply abstract<br />\nsplashes of color to the musical weave.<br />\nTaka-i-ki combined written composition with group and solo improvisations.<br />\nThe written music and guidelines they<br />\nreferred to during the performance were a<br />\nframework which supported and directed<br />\nthe otherwise free improvisaion. This was<br />\nevident in the overall impression of order<br />\none got from listening to the music.<br />\nFrenetic, near anarchic sound was balanced and quenched by sections that<br />\nexplored intervals of the major triad.<br />\nSections of jabbing, pointillistic sound<br />\nwould give way to motoric unison passages with a definite \"swing,\" which<br />\nwould in turn be transformed as the<br />\ninstruments stopped, started, accelerated,<br />\nfaded in and out. Unison to build a varied<br />\ntapestry of sound also lent itself to<br />\nconstruction of ostinatos \"stacked\" on<br />\ntop of each other.<br />\nThe music was essentially melodic in<br />\nform, although this melody was usually<br />\njagged, tortuous, and fragmentary. The<br />\nform was built up by repeating motivic<br />\nfragments over and over, each time with<br />\naccretions in a process of cumulative<br />\ngrowth and decay. An opening theme<br />\nwould set mood, rudiments of melody,<br />\nareas of pitch and/or rhythm as points of<br />\ndeparture for the players to explore. It<br /><br />\ndid not necessarily set up chord or<br />\nphrasing patterns; if it did, these were<br />\nexpanded, condensed, and used freely.<br />\nThe musical texture was fluid, with<br />\nrhythms appearing and disappearing,<br />\ncontinuity yielding to discontinuity.<br />\nSometimes a texture of atonality might<br />\nbe set up by juxtaposition of the alto's<br />\nlines with those of the guitar.<br />\nThe first composition performed on<br />\nSaturday night was \"Fools Before the<br />\nRain\" by Bishop. It was probably the<br />\nmost accessable piece presented, having<br />\nas motifs several \"Latin\" melodies and<br />\nhaving a fairly constant rhythm. It<br />\nintroduced Taka-i-ki's preoccupation with<br />\nsimultaneous variation around a melodic<br />\nline and the simultaneous occurrence of<br />\nindependent and unrelated melodies. The<br />\nguitar provided a constant accompaniment of percussive popping, bass tones,<br />\nand glissandos. Solos were played by each<br />\nof the saxophones, then brought back in<br />\nsuperposition to each other at later times.<br />\n\"Shilup,\" composed by Debbie<br />\nQuinn was next. This series of seven<br />\nshort pieces was my favorite. It was<br />\nplayed from a graphical score, consisting<br />\nof curves, dots, etc. about a central axis.<br />\nAt its completion, the score was turned<br />\nupside down and played again. The score<br />\nindicated areas of pitch and volume,<br />\nleaving much up to the musicians' creativity. The opening and closing sections<br />\nwere done entirely with voice, a meditative chant including other vocal effects.<br />\nThe various sections featured different<br />\ninstrumental combinations. Sections four<br />\nand five were outstanding examples of<br /><br />\ntwo approaches to the \"cloud of sound\"<br />\n(e.g. Coleman's \"Science Fiction\") method: one very anarchic, the other based<br />\non many repetitive figures, rapid chromatic scales and bridges, and random<br />\naccents.<br />\nBishop then played a solo piece for<br />\nalto clarinet, which offered some fascinating gurgling tones going from low to<br />\nhigh register, and haunting low-register<br />\nwork. The penultimate piece was Ayler's<br />\n\"New Generation,\" which ahs become a<br />\nsort of anthem for the new jazz. It was<br />\nparticularly suited to Taka-i-ki's treatment since it was originally performed<br />\nwith electric guitar and multiple saxophones. The final work was a consolidation of two pieces, \"Fed 4 Thought\"<br />\n(Levin) and \"Cheap Talk, Dirty Wine\"<br />\n(Bishop). Guitar was prominent in this<br />\nlong and engaging set. All of the forms<br />\nand techniques the musicians had been<br />\nusing thus far were restated and integrated in the final piece(s). There was<br />\nmuch emphasis on central pitches to<br />\nwhich other tension-producing chords<br />\nwere opposed 'by the guitar. A major<br />\nmotif was a musical shape that tumbled<br />\nfrom high to low register of alto and<br />\ntenor saxes. Steve Buchanan performed<br />\nan Oriental dance to a guitar solo of<br />\nflowing, gliding masses of sound. Other<br />\nhighlights were the spatial effect of the<br />\nmusicians walking around the audience<br />\nwhile playing, and Buchanan's somersaulting around the audience.<br />\nI suggest Taka-i-ki to anyone who<br />\nlikes to be challenged by their music.<br />\n--Mark Skoner<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / P 1GE 19<br /><br />\nr\u2014 WEEKEND<br />\no<br /><br />\neFite Aka eleArldt;n4 Wpm:yew:0<br />\nWiee Witti<br />\nRai<br /><br />\n4inginy<br /><br />\nReneti6dagtee aid,e4<br />\na/ni a/teat/yet&amp;<br />\nand Xietkna,<br />\ncr,e4iietfi4 9fa4ezs, CA. 52<br /><br />\nFriday &amp; Saturday<br /><br />\n..\"\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\"-<br /><br />\nMarch 16 &amp; 17<br />\nRemsen 1 \u2014 7:30 &amp; 10:00<br />\nADMISSION $1.00<br /><br />\nADMISSION FREE<br />\nSATURDAY MARCH 17<br />\n8 PM<br /><br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br /><br />\nTHE<br /><br />\nBARNSTORMERS<br />\nPRESENT<br /><br />\n00<br /><br />\nA<br /><br />\nSTUDIO THEATRE<br />\nPRODUCTION<br /><br />\n(-7/4M400 flL1<br />\nCu<br />\nFterr-rc,my<br /><br />\nA GOO DRAMA<br /><br />\nby<br /><br />\nSusan Griffin<br /><br />\ncEs<br /><br />\nFRIDAY, MARCH 16 7:30 PM<br />\nSUNDAY, MARCH 18 7:00 PM USTENINg-VIEWiNg ROOM IEVERiNg<br />\nAdMISSION<br /><br />\nhALE<br />\n.50<br /><br />\nthe ?c)c k f jarnonak<br /><br />\nEvEE<br /><br />\n131:<br /><br />\nP\\<br />\nMAGICAu.1<br /><br />\nG1a55<br />\nPaif 12i0<br /><br />\n1Pon6oReo<br />\nqr, Cie6l)<br />\n5octl Csynro{{-ee<br /><br />\nof(scio06<br />\n* 4,<br /><br />\n11 A K-C<br />\n1<br /><br />\n9\u20ac0<br /><br />\n/1<br /><br />\nf<br />\n,<br />\n.<br /><br />\nFEe<br />\n14fzi y<br />\nwo F\u2022E\u2022 is J4. c LitsS<br />\nSSio<br /><br />\nPAGE 20 I MARCH 16 1979<br /><br />\nThe Ratbskeilarz<br />\nSIOecoalk Baccet<br /><br />\nDiscover your place<br />\nin the scheme ofthings.<br /><br />\nServing Lunch 11:30.to 2.00 PM'<br />\nMonOag<br />\n3/19<br />\nTueseiag<br />\n3/20<br />\nWebneseoag<br /><br />\nPRESSURIZED WATER REACTOR POWER PLANT<br />\nis a place<br />\nin the<br />\nA place in the Navy's Nuclear Field<br />\nforefront of today's fastest-growing energy field.

He<br />\ncommented that this week is the<br />\nfirst time the team has had a<br />\nchance to practice outdoors.<br />\nFurthermore, the field is still in<br />\n.poor condition due to all the<br />\nwet winter weather) a further<br />\nimpediment to practice.<br /><br />\nNevertheless, Coach Myers<br />\nfeels the team has a good team<br />\nattitude<br />\nhas shown<br />\nand<br />\nsome improvement since it first<br />\nbegan practiCe in February. He<br />\nfeels that the strongest area of<br />\nthe team is its close defense,<br />\nwhere the two co-captains are<br />\nChip Carlson and Kevin Keefer.<br />\nKeefer is being converted from a<br />\nmidfielder. Duncan Swezy, a<br />\ntransfer student from Furman,<br />\nwill also play defense. Swezy,<br />\nwho also serves as a Blue Jay<br />\nfootball player, is ineligible to<br />\nplay this year, but is spending<br />\nthe season honing his fielding<br />\nskills. He is one of several<br />\nfootball and basketball players<br />\nwho have never played lacrosse<br />\nbefore, but who have joined this<br />\nyear's JV squad.<br />\nStarting in the net for the<br />\nJays will be Phil Lasalle, an<br /><br />\nexperienced veteran in the goalie's case. The other two goalies<br />\nare Barry Caplan and Rusty<br />\nMay.<br />\nThree corps of midfielders<br />\nwill be used by Coach Myers<br />\nthroughout the 1979 season. His<br />\ndefensive midfield squad includes<br />\nBond,<br />\nJay<br />\nGeorge<br />\nKatzenberger and Bernie Lane.<br />\nHis offensive midfield lines are<br />\nnot quite set yet, but at present<br />\nthey include Dan Jackson, Joe<br />\nCox and Todd Dietrich, along<br />\nwith Jim Bourdon, Randy<br />\nMayne and Matt May.<br />\nThe chief weakness of the<br />\nteam probably lies in the attack.<br />\nPaul Cook, who was cut from<br />\nthe varsity earlier this year, is<br />\nbeing converted from the midfield to an attack position.

The National<br />\nChampion Blue Jay Lacrosse<br />\nteam is no exception.

Instead,<br />\nthrough a series of slight connections Dave was given the<br />\nopportunity to try out for the<br />\nsquad. With his talents, he had<br />\nlittle trouble making the transition to field lacrosse.<br />\n\"The first few games were a<br />\nlittle tough,\" admitted the middie. \"You have to think a lot<br />\nmore in field lacrosse, and, of<br />\ncourse, you have to be a better<br />\nathlete.\"<br />\nBy his sophomore<br />\ncampaign, Huntley was on the<br />\nfirst midfield team to stay. He<br />\nwas also selected as an All-American in his second and third<br />\nseasons.<br />\nMidfielder Steve Wey, unlike his cohort, was born and<br />\nbred here in Baltimore. He<br />\nbegan his lax career in seventh<br />\ngrade and continued it on the<br />\nhigh school level at Calvert<br />\nHall. When it came time for<br />\nSteve to decide which college he<br />\nwanted to attend, there was<br />\nno question in his mind. Swey<br />\n(as he is sometimes called)<br />\nturned down full scholarships<br />\nat the University of North<br />\nCarolina and the University of<br />\nVirginia in order to opt for the<br />\nBlue Jays. \"Ever since I was a<br />\nkid,\" Steve explained, \"I had<br />\nwanted to play for Johns Hopkins.
