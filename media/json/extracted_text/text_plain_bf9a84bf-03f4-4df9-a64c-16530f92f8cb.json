Generally speaking, a graduate's first assignment is<br />\ninfluenced by his previous training and his expressed interest<br />\nin a particulPar type of work. Whenever possible, Du Pont<br />\noftsigns a man to the type of work he is trained for and wants<br />\n\u2014he'll do better in any field if he's highly interested. For<br />\nexample, my master's thesis was on the use of explosives,<br />\nand my first Du Pont -assignment was a study of the efficiency of explosives.<br />\nBut experience on the job really constitutes new training.<br />\nYou learn about other branches ofscience and engineering\u2014<br />\nyou broaden your horizons through daily contacts with<br />\nmen having other skills. The result is that arbitrary divisions between technical branches gradually dissolve, and<br />\nyou become ready for new assignments and new responsibilities\u2014even outside your original field. In my own case,I<br />\ndeveloped quite a bit of skill in mechanical and civil engineering techniques when I was called upon to supervise the<br />\n\"shooting\" of an experimental tunnel for the evaluation of<br />\nnew explosives\u2014even though my original training was in<br />\nmining engineering.<br />\nOf course, specialization in a definite field may be continued if the man specifically wants it and reveals a talent<br />\nfor it. The best opportunities for that are in research and<br />\ndevelopment. Naturally, the value of this kind of work is<br />\nalso recognized at Du Pont.<br />\nSo,no matter what your initial assignment may be, Don,<br />\nDu Pont is anxious to bring out your best. A good rule to<br />\nremember is this. A graduate's first assignment is often necessarily based on his field of training and his degree, but his<br />\nsubsequent progress at Du Pont is always based on his demonstrated ability.<br />\n<br />\n\fHomewood, Baltimore, March 18, 1965 I.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE SIX<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\nCoach Steinmann Observes<br />\nPlay Of Varsity Courtmen<br />\n<br />\nJ HU Spiked Shoe<br />\nSchedules Events<br />\nFor Tomorrow<br />\n<br />\nCoach Bridgers Compares<br />\nFrosh, Varsity Cindermen<br />\n<br />\nCreamer, Danny Si,vitky, Jack<br />\n\"Although neither the Freshmen<br />\nBurger, and Herb Butler.

Generally speaking, a graduate's first assignment is<br />\ninfluenced by his previous training and his expressed interest<br />\nin a particulPar type of work. Whenever possible, Du Pont<br />\noftsigns a man to the type of work he is trained for and wants<br />\n\u2014he'll do better in any field if he's highly interested. For<br />\nexample, my master's thesis was on the use of explosives,<br />\nand my first Du Pont -assignment was a study of the efficiency of explosives.<br />\nBut experience on the job really constitutes new training.<br />\nYou learn about other branches ofscience and engineering\u2014<br />\nyou broaden your horizons through daily contacts with<br />\nmen having other skills. The result is that arbitrary divisions between technical branches gradually dissolve, and<br />\nyou become ready for new assignments and new responsibilities\u2014even outside your original field. In my own case,I<br />\ndeveloped quite a bit of skill in mechanical and civil engineering techniques when I was called upon to supervise the<br />\n\"shooting\" of an experimental tunnel for the evaluation of<br />\nnew explosives\u2014even though my original training was in<br />\nmining engineering.<br />\nOf course, specialization in a definite field may be continued if the man specifically wants it and reveals a talent<br />\nfor it. The best opportunities for that are in research and<br />\ndevelopment. Naturally, the value of this kind of work is<br />\nalso recognized at Du Pont.<br />\nSo,no matter what your initial assignment may be, Don,<br />\nDu Pont is anxious to bring out your best. A good rule to<br />\nremember is this. A graduate's first assignment is often necessarily based on his field of training and his degree, but his<br />\nsubsequent progress at Du Pont is always based on his demonstrated ability.<br /><br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, March 18, 1965 I.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE SIX<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\nCoach Steinmann Observes<br />\nPlay Of Varsity Courtmen<br /><br />\nJ HU Spiked Shoe<br />\nSchedules Events<br />\nFor Tomorrow<br /><br />\nCoach Bridgers Compares<br />\nFrosh, Varsity Cindermen<br /><br />\nCreamer, Danny Si,vitky, Jack<br />\n\"Although neither the Freshmen<br />\nBurger, and Herb Butler.
