Mr. Carnegie's goal<br />\nwas to establish an institution<br />\ndedicated to the discovery of<br />\nknowledge by those exceptional<br />\nscientists that possessed imagination and dedication in<br />\ntheir specialty. These individuals are free to pursue<br />\nlines of research for many<br />\nyears. They are also just as free<br />\nto abandon nonproductive projects after only a short time.

More recently, new<br />\ntheories of the earth's formation and solar dynamics have<br />\nemerged.

The<br />\nfunding for these facilities<br />\ncomes from endowment income, which is supplemented to<br />\na significant extent by grants<br />\nand outside philanthropic mu,port. The board of trustees consists of a self-elected assembly<br />\nof leaders in science, education,<br />\nbusiness and public service that<br />\nis committed to Andrew<br />\nCarnegie's intentions. The<br />\nBoard of Trustees reviews institution results several times<br />\neach year. Day-to-day administration is provided by<br />\nCarnegie's president, Dr. James<br />\nD. Ebert.

These trainees then<br />\nleave after two years of close<br />\ncollaboration and pursue<br />\ncareers elsewhere. Thus the Institution has nurtured growing<br />\nfields of research in many<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institution has<br />\nhistorically utilized its resources<br />\nto support new and promising<br />\nfields of inquiry, as opposed to<br />\nones already funded and explored. This ideology allows its<br />\nscientists to pursue projects on<br />\nthe forefront of science, projects that somewhere else might<br />\nbe considered too risky to<br />\nspend precious funds on, and<br />\nwould be scrapped in favor of<br />\n<br />\nother endeavors that insure a<br />\nconstant influx of grant money.<br />\nFor this reason, the direction of<br />\nresearch<br />\nhas<br />\nchanged<br />\nsignificantly over the years.<br />\nSome fields have been incorporated by other, larger<br />\norganizations, while other activities were simply redefined<br />\nwithin the structure of the Institution.

Currently, about 169<br />\npatients are being treated at the<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Fred<br />\n<br />\nclinic and a little less than half<br />\nare receiving Depo-Provera.<br />\nThe use of Depo-Provera in<br />\nlieu of incarceration or coupled with shortened sentences,<br />\nprobation, or incarceration has<br />\nsparked at least a moderate<br />\namount of controversy across<br />\nthe nation.

Additionally, Depo-Provera has the<br />\neffect of calming or tranquilizing the sexual pathways in the<br />\nbrain, thereby relieving the patient from urges seemingly not<br />\nsubject to voluntary control.<br />\nPatients undergoing treatment with Depo-Provera usually receive 500 mg injected into<br />\nan arm muscle once a week for<br />\n<br />\nan indefinite period of time.<br />\nThe drug is comparable to insulin for diabetics in the sense<br />\nthat it controls urges to engage<br />\nin illicit sexual acts, but it does<br />\nnot cure or rid the patient of<br />\nthose desires.<br />\nIn addition to the positive effect of lowering sexual drive,<br />\nDepo-Provera has some<br />\ndefinite side effects for patients<br />\nreceiving treatment. Use of the<br />\ndrug frequently results in a<br />\nweight gain of 20-30 pounds or<br />\nmore and increased blood<br />\npressure. Berlin notes that<br />\n\"Some men experience hot<br />\nflashes, cold sweats, strange<br />\nnightmares, muscle weakness<br />\nand fatigue.\"<br />\nAnimal studies also show<br />\nthat, taken in large doses,<br />\nDepo-Provera can cause breast<br />\ncancer. The drug does not<br />\nfeminize men and most of the<br />\nside effects end when treatment<br />\nis discontinued,<br />\nSince Depo-Provera has only begun to be used extensively<br />\nas a treatment for paraphilia<br />\nrather recently, precise, longterm recidivism rates for the<br />\ndrug are unavailable. However,<br />\nthe latest data seem to suggest<br />\nthat recidivism for DepoProvera users in the United<br />\nStates is no higher than<br />\nrecidivism for surgically<br />\ncastrated paraphiliacs in<br />\nEurope. Both are under 5010.<br />\nWhen treatment of paraphiliacs<br />\nwith Depo-Provera is discon-<br />\n<br />\ntinued, recidivism rates jump to<br />\nabout 50%.<br />\nConsidering the high success<br />\nrate of Depo-Provera in<br />\nrehabilitating sex offenders and<br />\nthe humane nature of the treatment, Berlin feels that DepoProvera can be a useful weapon<br />\nin combating paraphilia. \"It<br />\nappears then that DepoProvera can be used to help<br />\nsome men help themselves.<br />\nSome pedophiles (men who<br />\n'perform sexual acts with<br />\nchildren) for example, report<br />\nbeing unable to successfully<br />\nresist sexual temptation<br />\nthrough 'will-power' alone even<br />\nwith the assistance of professional counseling. Such individuals should be afforded<br />\nthe opportunity to see whether<br />\nor not Depo-Provera confers<br />\nupon them an increased capacity for self control, thereby<br />\nenabling their behavior to be<br />\nmore a reflection of their intellectual desires and conscience<br />\nthan of their lusts and<br />\npassions.\"<br />\nBerlin insists that \"People do<br />\nnot decide voluntarily what will<br />\narouse them sexually. Rather,<br />\nin maturing, they discover the<br />\nnature of their own sexual<br />\norientation and interests.\"<br />\nWhen paraphiliacs seek \"help,<br />\nunderstanding, and empathy,<br />\nprofessional competence is required, not stigmatization or<br />\nunenlightened scorn.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f8/APRIL 6, 1984<br />\n<br />\nCarnegie Institute of Embryology at Hopkins<br />\nMany Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students have<br />\nbeen fortunate enough to work<br />\nin the Institution.

Proof positive is<br />\nLamar University from Alamo<br />\nCountry has now won 78 consecutive home games, the<br />\nlongest home streak going right<br />\nnow, and sixth longest in the<br />\nhistory of the NCAA.<br />\nLamar recently beat Louisiana Tech, 85-60, for No. 78.<br />\nBut what makes that so interesting is that Lamar had<br />\nbeen beaten by Tech by 23<br />\npoints at Ruston, La., back in<br />\nJanuary.<br />\nThink about it. How in the<br />\nworld can home advantage account for a 48-point spread in<br />\na two-game series?<br />\nLet me show you why it's<br />\nalmost always Miller Time at<br />\nhome.<br />\nFirst, you must realize that<br />\nofficials cannot counter their<br />\nsubconscience of the crowd, the<br />\ncheering of the crowd. They<br />\nhear the crowd, and it's only<br />\nhuman that anyone appreciates<br />\na pat on the back, applause,<br />\nrather than a kick in the pants.<br />\nSecond, remember the<br />\nballplayers for the home team<br />\nhave slept in their own bed the<br />\n<br />\nnight before, stayed with their<br />\nnormal routine, and they are<br />\naccustomed to the weather in<br />\nthat area and the food they eat.<br />\nThe visitors, on the other hand,<br />\nhave just endured the nonstructured discipline of making<br />\nplanes, checking into hotel<br />\nrooms, and irregular eating<br />\nhabits, psychologically, they<br />\nare in disarray.<br />\nThird, all good basetball<br />\nteams know they're supposed<br />\nto win at home.<br />\nIt's a psychological feeling<br />\nthat's padded by playing in<br />\nfront of your fraternity<br />\nbrothers and lady friends,<br />\nfaculty, parents and the inevitable alumni glad-handers. A<br />\nsecurity blanket feeling, really,<br />\nlike coming home when you<br />\nwere a kid and seeing the light<br />\non over the back porch.<br />\nFor the home team, the arena<br />\nis like the playground down the<br />\nstreet, or the basket over the<br />\ngarage in your driveway.<br />\nYou're familiar with the floor<br />\nand have a positive feeling.<br />\nLike a lot of times, teams play<br />\non portable courts, and the<br />\nvisiting team doesn't know<br />\nwhere the soft spots are, where<br />\nthe ball doesn't bounce un nor-<br />\n<br />\nmally, and the home team will<br />\nput defensive pressure on the<br />\nball handler at those spots.<br />\nAnother example: If the<br />\nvisiting team likes to fast-break<br />\na lot, the home team might wet<br />\nthe nets, so the ball won't come<br />\nthrough as fast. That stops their<br />\nfast break.<br />\nA lot of times, the home<br />\nteam puts their band or their<br />\nfootball players behind the<br />\nvisitors' bench, so it's difficult<br />\nto concentrate during time outs.<br />\nSometimes, they'll put extra<br />\nheat in the locker room to sap<br />\nthe strength of the players.

Last year, Marshall<br />\nCrenshaw played for the<br />\noccasion.<br />\nCrane and Checkla explained, \"We've had a lot of<br />\ntechnical difficulty in getting a<br />\ncontract with a popular performer. We just haven't been<br />\nable to find anyone.\"<br />\nCheckla continued, \"It's<br />\nbeen a sparse year for touring.<br />\nWe've been negotiating with<br />\nvarious performers who fall into our price range since intersession, but for a variety of<br /><br />\nreasons, we haven't been able<br />\nto get a contract with any of<br />\nthem.\"<br />\nNegotiations have been attempted with REM, Thomas<br />\nDolby, The Thompson Twins,<br />\nGang of Four, Blotto, and Cindy Lauper.

They distributed<br />\nthe anonymous surveys to all<br />\nsophomores, juniors and<br />\nseniors, and received a response<br />\nrate of 25 percent.<br />\nBoth Gordon and Lee noted<br />\nthat although the survey aimed<br />\nto assess the quality of the<br /><br />\nmaintenance service offered by<br />\nHopkins, \"almost half of the<br />\nstudent/tenant responses mentioned the Housing Office<br />\nstaff.\" In addition, they stated<br />\nthat the overwhelming majority<br />\nof the responses were negative.<br />\nAccording to the report,<br />\nstudents surveyed felt the<br />\nHousing Office Staff was<br />\nneither compassionate nor sympathetic to students' needs and<br />\nconcerns. The report indicated<br />\nthat the secretaries in the Housing Office maintained a \"blatantly poor, condescending,<br />\nand rude attitude,\" although a<br />\nfew respondents had neutral or<br />\npositive opinions about the<br />\nstaff.<br />\nThus, the report recommended that the \"Housing Office<br />\nstaff must be improved if they<br />\nare to deal with students on a<br /><br />\ndaily basis.

He<br />\nsaid the Band is the only SAC.<br />\norganization which receives<br />\nfunding for lodging for out-oftown trips, and that his club<br />\nand other organizations had<br />\nbeen refused similar funding.<br />\nHe argued that the Band should<br />\nnot receive money for lodging<br />\neither. His amendment was<br />\nvoted down, however, 28-11-7.<br />\nMark Morgolin, president of<br />\nthe Band, responded that the<br />\nband had always received such<br /><br />\ntunding because it is required to<br />\nplay at all lacrosse games.<br />\n\"In the past,\" Margolin<br />\nsaid, \"the Band has been<br />\nbudgeted for away lacrosse<br />\ngames.

This figure is not<br />\nyet final because both the SAC<br /><br />\nand the Student Council will<br />\nhave the opportunity to amend<br />\nthe budget.<br />\nKun said he had been accused<br />\nby a \"certain administrator\" of<br />\nbeing \"selfish for pursuing this<br />\nissue because the classes have<br />\nbeen cut back.\" He noted,<br />\nhowever, that classes sponsor<br />\nthe best attended events, and<br />\nthat among them they encompass every undergraduate.<br />\n\"If it reaches the point where<br /><br />\nthe SAC has to cut back on t<br />\nclasses, there is obviously a problem with the amount we're<br />\n[student activities in general]<br />\nbeing allocated,\" Kun said.<br />\nKun said he had also been<br />\ntold by administrators that it<br />\nwas \"out of line\" to ask for<br />\nmore money.

The definition<br />\nof rock, howe\u2018er, was left to<br />\nthe discretion of the Fair CoChairmen and Assistant Dean<br />\nof Students (then Director of<br />\nitudent Activities) Chris<br />\n'olombo.<br />\nIt kind of came do\u2018N n to a<br />\nompromise situation,\" said<br />\ntruce Solitar, who was CoChairman of Music last year<br />\nand is again this year. \"It was<br />\na gi\u2018e-and-take thing.\"<br /><br />\nUsing a rather strict definition of rock, Colombo decided<br />\nto let a band called Jr. Cline<br />\nand the Recliners play at last<br />\nyear's Fair. Officially, they<br />\nwere classified as playing<br /><br />\n\"rhythm-and-blues,\" not rock.<br />\nAccording to Colombo,<br />\nhowever, a band playing the<br />\nsame kind of music as Jr. Cline<br />\nwould not be allowed to play<br />\nunder this year's policy.<br /><br />\nChris Colombo<br /><br />\nThai is due, according to<br />\nColombo, to problems which<br />\narose last year when .1 r.

While<br />\nacknowledging that there were<br />\nsuch problems, Solitar noted<br />\nthat the weather cleared up in<br />\nthe afternoon, just as Jr. Cline<br />\nbegan to play.

More than 1000 students<br />\ntake at least one course per<br />\nsemester using this grading<br />\nsystem.<br />\nOriginally instituted to permit students to take courses<br />\noutside of their major without<br />\nhaving to worry about a<br />\ngrade, the option has come to<br />\nbe interpreted differently by<br />\nstudents. According to Assistant Dean for Academic<br />\nStudies Martha Roseman,<br />\n\"students now feel that 'if I<br />\ndon't do well, I'll .take it<br />\npass/fail; if I do well, I'll take<br />\nit for a grade.' \" Although<br />\nrepresenting a change in<br />\nphilosophy, Roseman does<br />\nnot feel that the alternative<br />\ngrading system has been<br />\nabused.<br />\nThe worst problem occurs<br />\nwhen students attempt to<br />\nchange their pass/fail decisions beyond the last date to<br /><br />\ndo so or even after the<br />\nsemester's grades have been<br />\nrecorded. \"Students that<br />\ndon't do well come to me and<br />\nbeg or even have a faculty<br />\nmember recommend that<br />\ngrades be changed to<br />\npass/fail,\" said Roseman.

Mr. Carnegie's goal<br />\nwas to establish an institution<br />\ndedicated to the discovery of<br />\nknowledge by those exceptional<br />\nscientists that possessed imagination and dedication in<br />\ntheir specialty. These individuals are free to pursue<br />\nlines of research for many<br />\nyears. They are also just as free<br />\nto abandon nonproductive projects after only a short time. Investigators are given the equipment, time, and funding<br />\nnecessary to foster their best<br />\nwork.<br />\nThis atmosphere, at the<br />\nvarious centers of the Caraegie<br />\nInstitution, has helped bring<br /><br />\nby Paul Brunetta<br />\nWhy do we study the nervous system of<br />\nthe leech, the eggs ofafrog, the sperm<br />\nof a worm, the genes offruitflies and<br />\ncorn?

University<br />\nParkway, is unknown to many<br />\nHopkins students. This facility<br />\nis one of five divisions of the<br />\nCarnegie Institution of<br />\nWashington, and has provided<br />\nsome of the finest embryological discoveries in the<br />\nnation.<br /><br />\nThe<br /><br />\nCarnegie<br /><br />\nInstitution<br /><br />\non<br /><br />\nW.<br /><br />\nUniversity<br /><br />\nBill Meeker<br />\nParkway<br /><br />\nabout crucial discoveries in the<br />\nhistory of science, including<br />\nradar, hybrid corn, the Big<br />\nBang theory of the origin of the<br />\nuniverse, and much of the<br />\ncritical evidence in support of<br />\nDNA's role as the genetic<br />\nmaterial. More recently, new<br />\ntheories of the earth's formation and solar dynamics have<br />\nemerged. Other advances include a greater understanding<br />\nof plant adaptation in environmental extremes and new<br />\nmethods for gene transfer in<br />\nhigher animals.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institution is<br />\nan independent, non-profit<br />\nresearch institution\u2014the first<br />\nof its kind in the nation. The<br />\nfunding for these facilities<br />\ncomes from endowment income, which is supplemented to<br />\na significant extent by grants<br />\nand outside philanthropic mu,port. The board of trustees consists of a self-elected assembly<br />\nof leaders in science, education,<br />\nbusiness and public service that<br />\nis committed to Andrew<br />\nCarnegie's intentions. The<br />\nBoard of Trustees reviews institution results several times<br />\neach year. Day-to-day administration is provided by<br />\nCarnegie's president, Dr. James<br />\nD. Ebert. Each department has<br />\na director, from 8 to 10 scientific staff members, a support<br />\nstaff, and a constant flow of<br />\npostdoctoral fellows.<br />\nThe training of junior scien-<br /><br />\nDonald Brown<br />\ntists is a primary goal of the institution, and students and<br />\nfellows from nearly every<br />\nregion of the globe come to<br />\nCarnegie's different departments to train with senior staff<br />\nmembers. These trainees then<br />\nleave after two years of close<br />\ncollaboration and pursue<br />\ncareers elsewhere. Thus the Institution has nurtured growing<br />\nfields of research in many<br />\ncountries.<br />\nThe Carnegie Institution has<br />\nhistorically utilized its resources<br />\nto support new and promising<br />\nfields of inquiry, as opposed to<br />\nones already funded and explored. This ideology allows its<br />\nscientists to pursue projects on<br />\nthe forefront of science, projects that somewhere else might<br />\nbe considered too risky to<br />\nspend precious funds on, and<br />\nwould be scrapped in favor of<br /><br />\nother endeavors that insure a<br />\nconstant influx of grant money.<br />\nFor this reason, the direction of<br />\nresearch<br />\nhas<br />\nchanged<br />\nsignificantly over the years.<br />\nSome fields have been incorporated by other, larger<br />\norganizations, while other activities were simply redefined<br />\nwithin the structure of the Institution. An example of the<br />\nredistribution can be found in<br />\nthe work of the Carnegie<br />\nDepartment of Genetics,<br />\nlocated in Cold Springs Harbor, N.Y., which produced the<br />\nimportant discoveries of recent<br />\nNobel Prize Winner Barbara<br />\nMcClintock. Her work continues today in molecular<br />\ngenetics research at the Department of Embryology, a<br />\nminute's walk from our<br />\nAthletic Center.<br />\nThe Department of Embryology, on Hopkins'<br />\nHomewood campus, was<br />\nfounded in 1913 with the goal<br />\nof better understanding the<br />\ndevelopment of the human embryo. Today, the Department<br />\nhas two main directions. One<br />\naims at understanding the<br />\ngenes, their structure, evolution, and control, while the<br />\nother stresses the mechanism of<br />\ncellular communication and is<br />\nfocused on the structure and<br />\nfunction of cell membranes.<br />\nExamples of their achievements<br />\nare easily found in their procont. on p. 8<br /><br />\nSex Offenders Rehabilitated at Hopkins Clinic<br />\nby Timothy McNamara<br />\nIn recent months, the Biosexual Psychohormonal Clinic of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital<br />\nand School of Medicine has increasingly received attention for<br />\nits rather revolutionary program of treatment for sexual<br />\nabnormalities. The clinic uses a<br />\ntestosterone reducing drug called Depo-Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate) as an<br />\nalternative and/or supplement<br />\nto more traditional methods of<br />\npunishment and rehabilitation<br />\nof sex offenders.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Fred<br />\nBerlin, co-director of the clinic,<br />\n\"Studies begun at Hopkins in<br />\n1966 have shown that sex offenders, or paraphiliacs, treated<br />\nwith Depo-Provera plus<br />\ncounseling have gained in selfregulation of sexual behavior.<br />\nPatients in this clinic are not<br />\ncareer criminals, but persons<br />\nwho experience unusual sexual<br />\ndrives, such as preoccupations<br />\nwith children, exhibitionism, or<br />\nmasochism, and who appear<br />\nunable to control their sexual<br />\nbehavior.\"<br />\nWhile Depo-Provera has<br />\nbeen administered to sex offenders at Hopkins for over 18<br />\nyears, the majority of men currently being treated started using the drug after the founding<br />\nof the clinic three and a half<br />\nyears ago. Currently, about 169<br />\npatients are being treated at the<br />\n.<br /><br />\nDr. Fred<br /><br />\nclinic and a little less than half<br />\nare receiving Depo-Provera.<br />\nThe use of Depo-Provera in<br />\nlieu of incarceration or coupled with shortened sentences,<br />\nprobation, or incarceration has<br />\nsparked at least a moderate<br />\namount of controversy across<br />\nthe nation. According to Berlin,<br />\n\"Society as well as the sex offender will likely benefit if the<br />\noffender can be treated successfully (with drugs like DepoProvera) rather than being imprisoned and then released unchanged. There is no evidence,<br />\nexcept in the case of the<br />\nparaphiliac sadist or rapist, that<br />\nhaving a paraphiliac syndrome<br />\nincreases the probability of<br />\nphysical violence, and some<br /><br />\n\u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u20224 \u2022-\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n-4<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nBaltimore Sun<br /><br />\nBerlin<br />\nparaphiliacs seem reasonably<br />\nwell adjusted at work and in<br />\nother spheres of social<br />\nendeavor.\"<br />\nDepo-Provera<br />\nworks<br />\nthrough \"its effect upon neural<br />\npathways in the brain to inhibit<br />\nthe release of luteinizing hormone (LH),\" the hormone<br />\nresponsible for stimulating production of testosterone. Additionally, Depo-Provera has the<br />\neffect of calming or tranquilizing the sexual pathways in the<br />\nbrain, thereby relieving the patient from urges seemingly not<br />\nsubject to voluntary control.<br />\nPatients undergoing treatment with Depo-Provera usually receive 500 mg injected into<br />\nan arm muscle once a week for<br /><br />\nan indefinite period of time.<br />\nThe drug is comparable to insulin for diabetics in the sense<br />\nthat it controls urges to engage<br />\nin illicit sexual acts, but it does<br />\nnot cure or rid the patient of<br />\nthose desires.<br />\nIn addition to the positive effect of lowering sexual drive,<br />\nDepo-Provera has some<br />\ndefinite side effects for patients<br />\nreceiving treatment. Use of the<br />\ndrug frequently results in a<br />\nweight gain of 20-30 pounds or<br />\nmore and increased blood<br />\npressure. Berlin notes that<br />\n\"Some men experience hot<br />\nflashes, cold sweats, strange<br />\nnightmares, muscle weakness<br />\nand fatigue.\"<br />\nAnimal studies also show<br />\nthat, taken in large doses,<br />\nDepo-Provera can cause breast<br />\ncancer. The drug does not<br />\nfeminize men and most of the<br />\nside effects end when treatment<br />\nis discontinued,<br />\nSince Depo-Provera has only begun to be used extensively<br />\nas a treatment for paraphilia<br />\nrather recently, precise, longterm recidivism rates for the<br />\ndrug are unavailable. However,<br />\nthe latest data seem to suggest<br />\nthat recidivism for DepoProvera users in the United<br />\nStates is no higher than<br />\nrecidivism for surgically<br />\ncastrated paraphiliacs in<br />\nEurope. Both are under 5010.<br />\nWhen treatment of paraphiliacs<br />\nwith Depo-Provera is discon-<br /><br />\ntinued, recidivism rates jump to<br />\nabout 50%.<br />\nConsidering the high success<br />\nrate of Depo-Provera in<br />\nrehabilitating sex offenders and<br />\nthe humane nature of the treatment, Berlin feels that DepoProvera can be a useful weapon<br />\nin combating paraphilia. \"It<br />\nappears then that DepoProvera can be used to help<br />\nsome men help themselves.<br />\nSome pedophiles (men who<br />\n'perform sexual acts with<br />\nchildren) for example, report<br />\nbeing unable to successfully<br />\nresist sexual temptation<br />\nthrough 'will-power' alone even<br />\nwith the assistance of professional counseling. Such individuals should be afforded<br />\nthe opportunity to see whether<br />\nor not Depo-Provera confers<br />\nupon them an increased capacity for self control, thereby<br />\nenabling their behavior to be<br />\nmore a reflection of their intellectual desires and conscience<br />\nthan of their lusts and<br />\npassions.\"<br />\nBerlin insists that \"People do<br />\nnot decide voluntarily what will<br />\narouse them sexually. Rather,<br />\nin maturing, they discover the<br />\nnature of their own sexual<br />\norientation and interests.\"<br />\nWhen paraphiliacs seek \"help,<br />\nunderstanding, and empathy,<br />\nprofessional competence is required, not stigmatization or<br />\nunenlightened scorn.\"<br /><br />\n8/APRIL 6, 1984<br /><br />\nCarnegie Institute of Embryology at Hopkins<br />\nMany Hopkins undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students have<br />\nbeen fortunate enough to work<br />\nin the Institution.

Proof positive is<br />\nLamar University from Alamo<br />\nCountry has now won 78 consecutive home games, the<br />\nlongest home streak going right<br />\nnow, and sixth longest in the<br />\nhistory of the NCAA.<br />\nLamar recently beat Louisiana Tech, 85-60, for No. 78.<br />\nBut what makes that so interesting is that Lamar had<br />\nbeen beaten by Tech by 23<br />\npoints at Ruston, La., back in<br />\nJanuary.<br />\nThink about it. How in the<br />\nworld can home advantage account for a 48-point spread in<br />\na two-game series?<br />\nLet me show you why it's<br />\nalmost always Miller Time at<br />\nhome.<br />\nFirst, you must realize that<br />\nofficials cannot counter their<br />\nsubconscience of the crowd, the<br />\ncheering of the crowd. They<br />\nhear the crowd, and it's only<br />\nhuman that anyone appreciates<br />\na pat on the back, applause,<br />\nrather than a kick in the pants.<br />\nSecond, remember the<br />\nballplayers for the home team<br />\nhave slept in their own bed the<br /><br />\nnight before, stayed with their<br />\nnormal routine, and they are<br />\naccustomed to the weather in<br />\nthat area and the food they eat.<br />\nThe visitors, on the other hand,<br />\nhave just endured the nonstructured discipline of making<br />\nplanes, checking into hotel<br />\nrooms, and irregular eating<br />\nhabits, psychologically, they<br />\nare in disarray.<br />\nThird, all good basetball<br />\nteams know they're supposed<br />\nto win at home.<br />\nIt's a psychological feeling<br />\nthat's padded by playing in<br />\nfront of your fraternity<br />\nbrothers and lady friends,<br />\nfaculty, parents and the inevitable alumni glad-handers. A<br />\nsecurity blanket feeling, really,<br />\nlike coming home when you<br />\nwere a kid and seeing the light<br />\non over the back porch.<br />\nFor the home team, the arena<br />\nis like the playground down the<br />\nstreet, or the basket over the<br />\ngarage in your driveway.<br />\nYou're familiar with the floor<br />\nand have a positive feeling.<br />\nLike a lot of times, teams play<br />\non portable courts, and the<br />\nvisiting team doesn't know<br />\nwhere the soft spots are, where<br />\nthe ball doesn't bounce un nor-<br /><br />\nmally, and the home team will<br />\nput defensive pressure on the<br />\nball handler at those spots.<br />\nAnother example: If the<br />\nvisiting team likes to fast-break<br />\na lot, the home team might wet<br />\nthe nets, so the ball won't come<br />\nthrough as fast. That stops their<br />\nfast break.<br />\nA lot of times, the home<br />\nteam puts their band or their<br />\nfootball players behind the<br />\nvisitors' bench, so it's difficult<br />\nto concentrate during time outs.<br />\nSometimes, they'll put extra<br />\nheat in the locker room to sap<br />\nthe strength of the players. And<br />\nusually, at half time, the key to<br />\nthe locker room becomes a<br />\nphantom and you're stuck in<br />\nthe hallway four or five<br />\nminutes.<br />\nSo what we're talking about<br />\nis playing in a whole friendly<br />\nenvironment versus the<br />\nhostilities of the snake pits the<br />\nplayers visit on the road.<br />\nThat's why good teams hardly ever lose at home. Any team<br />\nthat's in the top 15 in the country will very rarely lose more<br />\nthan two games at home in a<br />\nseason.<br />\nFor trivia buffs: The longest<br />\nhome streak ever was by Kentucky, 129 straight from<br />\n1943-55. St. Bonnie was second, with 99 from 1948-61, the<br />\nBruins of UCLA third with 98<br />\nfrom 1970-76, then Cincinnati<br />\nwith 90, from 1957-64.<br />\nArizona, from 1945-51, and my<br />\nMarquette teams from 1967-73,<br />\nare tied for fifth with 81, a<br />\nnumber Lamar can equal if<br />\nthey win their last regular<br />\nseason home game, and the two<br />\ngames in their conference<br />\ntourney.<br /><br />\nPETITIONS<br /><br />\nBaseball Blues<br />\nby Marc Crowe<br /><br />\nmy first uniform playing in that<br />\nsummer league\u2014grey flannel<br />\nwith the Ho Jo's logo printed<br />\nThe old glove is dead.<br />\nThe over-oiled, black in- across the back.
