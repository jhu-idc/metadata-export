Perhaps it is the lighting instinct with which we<br />\nare credited, perhaps the instinct of fear. But whatever the<br />\ncause, we do know- there is a battle going on, a struggle between teacher and student.<br />\nIt is really absorbing to watch this ludricous and pathetic<br />\nstruggle. The professor spews out his crazily compounded<br />\nlectures fol., say two weeks. The enemy stores these effusions<br />\nin a little notebook, only to throw them back when the next attack, a quiz, comes. If a lone student attempts to make a<br />\nsingle-handed assault in verbal controversy by tiring a question,<br />\nhe finds himself on untenable ground, between two fires. For,<br />\naccording to the rules of modern warfare, laid down by the<br />\nteacher, this is a violation of all the laws that were ever written. And on the other hand, what re-enforcement does the<br />\ncourageous one get from his allies? They respond joyfully<br />\nwith their moral support by yelling, -Handshaker, handshaker.\"<br />\nBut the battle still rages, and at the end of two weeks a<br />\nviolent skirmish is begun.<br />\n,<br />\nAnd those skirmishes, those quizzes. For some time after<br />\nthe beginning of the yearly hostilities the professor endeavors<br />\nto outguess the student-enemy as to the time of skirmish. Now<br />\nit is on Tuesday, now on Wednesday, now on ,Friday. To what<br />\npurpose? But that's all in the game. Suppose the enemy can't<br />\nguess? Hard luck! The professor puts it down for another<br />\ncasualty. Just the rightful spoils of war. Besides, everything<br />\nis fair in love and war. And this is war!<br />\nJust how shrewd the student becomes, or is forced to become in order to survive. It is sink or swim. .Soon after the<br />\nbeginning of the year he guesses almost precisely when the<br />\nenemy's attack will come. Ile can tell to a day, or at least<br />\nwithin two days. If he does not get it on Tuesday it will surely<br />\nbe on Friday ; and so he will prepare all the harder to beat the<br />\n'teacher.<br />\nAnd what does the teacher do when he discovers that he is<br />\nbeing outguessed, for he surely will, being a good officer, assume the student has as much innate feeling for war as he has?<br />\nHe proceeds to devise new methods of attack.<br />\nAnd what is this new attack? This time, being foiled in<br />\nthe surprise attack, the professor immediately proceeds to<br />\nlocate some of the most obscure and out-of-the-way points where<br />\nhe call attack from the flank, and where he knows the enemy to<br />\nbe weakest. Those questions! Those hellish things could be<br />\nfashioned only by a Hindoo mystic or a bow-legged saxophone<br />\nplayer.<br />\nWhen does the war end? There is no end, only a truce.<br />\nThere is a helluva battle that continues for about a week at the<br />\nend of May. In this battle, which is recognized, and generally<br />\ncompelled by official regulations, all the teachers unite, and<br />\neach take one final crack. This always finishes the enemy,<br />\nintellectually as far as the course goes, if he passes, and financially if Ite doesn't. -At the end of this big battle hostilities are<br />\nover for that term, to begin again the following October.<br />\nPerhaps our ideas on college are wrong and childish.

Perhaps it is the lighting instinct with which we<br />\nare credited, perhaps the instinct of fear. But whatever the<br />\ncause, we do know- there is a battle going on, a struggle between teacher and student.<br />\nIt is really absorbing to watch this ludricous and pathetic<br />\nstruggle. The professor spews out his crazily compounded<br />\nlectures fol., say two weeks. The enemy stores these effusions<br />\nin a little notebook, only to throw them back when the next attack, a quiz, comes. If a lone student attempts to make a<br />\nsingle-handed assault in verbal controversy by tiring a question,<br />\nhe finds himself on untenable ground, between two fires. For,<br />\naccording to the rules of modern warfare, laid down by the<br />\nteacher, this is a violation of all the laws that were ever written. And on the other hand, what re-enforcement does the<br />\ncourageous one get from his allies? They respond joyfully<br />\nwith their moral support by yelling, -Handshaker, handshaker.\"<br />\nBut the battle still rages, and at the end of two weeks a<br />\nviolent skirmish is begun.<br />\n,<br />\nAnd those skirmishes, those quizzes. For some time after<br />\nthe beginning of the yearly hostilities the professor endeavors<br />\nto outguess the student-enemy as to the time of skirmish. Now<br />\nit is on Tuesday, now on Wednesday, now on ,Friday. To what<br />\npurpose? But that's all in the game. Suppose the enemy can't<br />\nguess? Hard luck! The professor puts it down for another<br />\ncasualty. Just the rightful spoils of war. Besides, everything<br />\nis fair in love and war. And this is war!<br />\nJust how shrewd the student becomes, or is forced to become in order to survive. It is sink or swim. .Soon after the<br />\nbeginning of the year he guesses almost precisely when the<br />\nenemy's attack will come. Ile can tell to a day, or at least<br />\nwithin two days. If he does not get it on Tuesday it will surely<br />\nbe on Friday ; and so he will prepare all the harder to beat the<br />\n'teacher.<br />\nAnd what does the teacher do when he discovers that he is<br />\nbeing outguessed, for he surely will, being a good officer, assume the student has as much innate feeling for war as he has?<br />\nHe proceeds to devise new methods of attack.<br />\nAnd what is this new attack? This time, being foiled in<br />\nthe surprise attack, the professor immediately proceeds to<br />\nlocate some of the most obscure and out-of-the-way points where<br />\nhe call attack from the flank, and where he knows the enemy to<br />\nbe weakest. Those questions! Those hellish things could be<br />\nfashioned only by a Hindoo mystic or a bow-legged saxophone<br />\nplayer.<br />\nWhen does the war end?

This seems to us one of the most convincing proofs of college loyalty that has been manifested for a<br />\n- long time.<br />\ni[<br />\nIn former years, when there was not the slightest hint<br />\nthat the present order of things would be shaken, graduating<br />\nclasses have pledged money to the University, usually with the<br />\n:33tipulation that it be used for the advancement of some phase<br />\n:pcof undergraduate life. It was only natural for them to make<br />\nthis reservation in favor of the side of college life that they<br />\n!knew best, and which had meant so much to them.<br />\nIt has rerimined for the class of '26 to show how deep the<br />\nloyalty of the undergraduates really is. We do not believe that<br />\n,the majority of them are in favor of the new plan from a<br />\n;purely personal point of view.

To more facile<br />\npens and more fervid imaginations we leave the glowing descriptions of the last chance for fellowship with the comrades of<br />\nfour years, dreamy music in the Botanical Gardens, mellow<br />\nmoonlight and the one and only girl\u2014provided, of course, that<br />\n,she isn't with somebodyelse--at the time and all the rest.<br />\nWe merely wish to suggest to those who have not had the<br />\n'pleasure of attending a June Week that they make every effort<br />\nto do so this year. It will be well worth while. The social side<br />\nof college life has never been especially emphasized at Hopkins.<br />\nThere are, of course, the weekly informal dances, and the two<br />\n,cotillions, but the only important attempt along those lines is<br />\nJune Week.
