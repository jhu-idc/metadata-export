In<br />\nFebruary of 1972 the Council<br />\nreceived the Final Report of the<br />\nBlue Ribbon Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Education of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. In<br />\nthis report, the Committee<br />\nstated that \". . .about half of a<br />\nfaculty member's time is supposed to be spc it doing scholarly research. It is on this that he<br />\nis largely judged for promotion<br />\nand salary. . .If the quality of<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate teaching is to<br />\nimprove, the University must.. .<br />\n.find a broader means of evaluating faculty members in order to<br />\nreward them for meeting the<br />\nUniversity's needs.\"<br />\nThe report continued that<br />\n\"unless a broader system of<br />\nevaluation is instituted, there is<br />\nlittle chance of changing present<br />\nteaching practices.\" In light of<br />\nthis observation, which the Committee made by examining the<br />\nresults of a survey answered by<br />\nhalf of the University's undergraduates, several recommenda-<br />\n<br />\ntions were forwarded to the<br />\nAcademic Council. One recommendation asked that \"the University adopt appropriate methods for recognizing and rewarding quality and innovation<br />\nin teaching. We urge the formation of a faculty-student-administration committee to establish<br />\na proper system for teaching<br />\nevaluation in all undergraduate<br />\ncourses. . .We strongly urge that<br />\nevery student have an opportunity to contribute to this evaluation process and that each<br />\ndepartment take the initiative in<br />\n<br />\nappraising and promoting better<br />\nteaching.\" This recommendation concluded by declaring that<br />\n\"to be meaningful, we propose<br />\nthat teaching evaluation be a<br />\nsignificant component in judging<br />\nfaculty promotions and salaries.\"<br />\nIn May of 1976, the Student Council attempted to sway<br />\nthe Academic Council into revising some of its rules on tenure<br />\nand promotions. In a letter sent<br />\nto the Academic Council dated<br />\nMay 11, 1976, the Student<br />\nCouncil recommended that the<br />\n<br />\nmemorandum which outlines<br />\n\"procedures for consideration of<br />\nfaculty appointments and promotions\" be reworded to state<br />\nthat evaluations of a candidate's<br />\nteaching would be considered in<br />\ndetermining such advances of<br />\nfaculty members. Says the Student Council memorandum, \"Information on the candidate's<br />\nundergraduate teaching, including Course Evaluation and the<br />\nresults of other surveys by<br />\nundergraduates, when available,<br />\nshall be included in the file of<br />\nthe candidate. . .\"<br />\n<br />\nPSUSponsors Speakers On FinancialAid<br />\nBY SHERYL JASSEN<br />\n<br />\nform of federally-sponsored financial assistance.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins UniverAt a meeting this past<br />\nWednesday night, the Hopkins sity's Financial Aid Director,<br />\nProgressive Student Union (PSU) Susan Broadbent, spoke to conwelcomed two guest speakers cerned students at the PSU<br />\nwho discussed the effect the meeting. \"Financial aid has<br />\nproposed financial aid budget helped public and private institucuts will have on students and tions,\" she said. The financial<br />\nthe possible courses of action aid director described her views<br />\nthat students may take. A third on the proposed cuts and<br />\nspeaker addressed the issue of resulting figures, commenting<br />\nAffirmative Action.<br />\n\"The changes being made now<br />\nThe Reagan administration are going to be a real danger in<br />\nhas proposed massive cutbacks 1982-83.\" She countered the<br />\nin student aid programs, calling argument used by the Reagan<br />\nfor an overall funding reduction administration that there is a<br />\nof 45 percent.

Responding to<br />\nwill dramatically affect the the occurrence of students falseestimated 13 million college ly claiming independent status,<br />\nstudents throughout the country she noted, \"Not many here<br />\nwho,receive and rely upon some succeed in claiming independent<br />\n<br />\nsupport\u2014it simply doesn't happen.\"<br />\nAccording to Broadbent, as<br />\ntuition costs increase and financial aid decreases, what will<br />\nresult is less of a choice by<br />\nstudents and their families.<br />\n\"Education, like maintaining<br />\ngood health, will become a<br />\nluxury in this country, with the<br />\nmiddle class being squeezed out<br />\nof eligibility.\" At Hopkins,<br />\nBroadbent believes, aid cuts<br />\ncould lead to possible changes in<br />\nadministration policy. \"This<br />\nUniversity is concerned with<br />\nresearch: student education is<br />\nsecondary. Rather than outright<br />\njoint admissions and financial<br />\naid review, we will continue to<br />\nkeep the two separte, but the<br />\nfull aid given will be denied to<br />\nthose students who demonstrate<br />\nneed.\" She added, \"Clearly we<br />\nwill have fewer students on aid,<br />\nand in the long run, we'll have a<br />\nless diverse population than we<br />\nhave now.\" Currently, 1000 of<br />\nthe 2300 undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins receive aid directly and<br />\nthrough work-study.<br />\n\"This is the time to participate if you're going to,\" Broadbent urged. Everyone should<br />\nwrite<br />\nto<br />\nhis<br />\ncongresspeople\u2014they<br />\nneed<br />\nto<br />\nbe<br />\nstroked.\" Other ways to avoid<br />\nthe passing of the proposed<br />\n<br />\nbudget cuts were suggested by<br />\nanother speaker, Janice Fine, the<br />\nUnited States Students Association representative, including<br />\nobtaining voting records of the<br />\npoliticians, voting to re-elect<br />\nonly those who've favored maintaining the current aid program.<br />\n\"You may want to avail yourselves of the Official White<br />\nHouse Comment Line and tell<br />\nMr. Reagan how you feel.\"<br />\n\"The best kinds of policies<br />\nare incrementally changed\u2014not<br />\nabruptly stopped,\" she expressed. She feels that if the cut<br />\n\"goes through\u2014which it won't<br />\nbecause we're going to fight and<br />\nscream and holler,\" many students will be denied an education, \"and education is one of<br />\nthe primary rights we have.\"<br />\nA march for support of<br />\nhigher education and against the<br />\nproposed financial aid budget<br />\ncuts, is planned for Monday,<br />\nMarch 1, in Washington, D.C.<br />\nThe third speaker, Ken<br />\nMorgan, a city activist in favor<br />\nof Affirmative Action, commented on the absence of a<br />\nstrong Affirmative Action policy<br />\nat Hopkins.

In attempting to<br />\nstudy at the library for the<br />\nrecent Organic Chemistry exam,<br />\nI found it virtually impossible<br />\nto answer any questions about<br />\ntopics that were not fully<br />\ncovered in my notes.<br />\nThe other problem deals<br />\nwith the only real study aid<br />\navailable. I am referring to past<br />\n<br />\nexams that are on file. While the<br />\nexams are easily accessible, I was<br />\ndisturbed by their poor conditions. Almost all of them were<br />\nmarked by past users who either<br />\nwrote the answers next to the<br />\nquestion (which makes it difficult to test yourself) or actually marked the questions so that<br />\nit was impossible to understand<br />\nwhat was being asked. Obviously the conditions of the exams<br />\nare not checked after their use<br />\nbecause they are now in a state<br />\nwhere they are, at best, of<br />\nmarginal use.<br />\nThe situation at the MSE<br />\nLibrary must be changed. Organic Chemistry is one of the<br />\nmost difficult and most important courses offered at this<br />\nuniversity.

Last September,<br />\nSenator Orrin Hatch introduced<br />\na \"Federalism Amendment\" to<br />\nthe Constitution, designed to<br />\nban abortions. A Constitutional<br />\nAmendment is required to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court<br />\ndecision in Roe vs. Wade that<br />\nruled a woman's right to choose<br />\nan abortion is guaranteed by the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nHatch's amendment, the<br />\nnewest proposal for a Constitutional ban on abortions, is<br />\nscheduled for a vote in the<br />\nSenate Judiciary Committee<br />\nnext Wednesday, March 3. Since<br />\nthis amendment does not attempt to define the \"personhood\" of a fetus, it appears to<br />\nbe more moderate than other<br />\nThis presents an<br />\nversions.<br />\nimportant challenge to reproductive rights activists because<br />\nit is not moderate, but rather a<br />\nsmoke screen for anti-abortionists to hide behind.<br />\nThe \"Federalism Amendment\" authorizes Congress and<br />\nthe states to restrict or prohibit<br />\nabortions, but unlike previous<br />\nbills, it avoids the question of<br />\nwhen human life begins. Like<br />\nprevious \"human life\" amendments, Hatch's proposal would<br />\noverturn the 1973 Supreme<br />\nCourt decision and, a careful<br />\nreading of the full text demonstrates the fallacy of believing<br />\nthis is a moderate bill: \"A right<br />\nto abortion is not secured by<br />\nthis Constitution.

In fact, a<br />\nmemorandum circulated among<br />\n\"pro-life\" groups stated that \"...<br />\nright-to-life leaders are far less<br />\noptimistic about the possibility<br />\nof passing and ratifying the ideal<br />\namendment in the foreseeable<br />\nfuture than they care to admit in<br />\npublic.\" According to their own<br />\nfigures, anti-abortionists have 51<br />\nof 67 votes needed in the Senate<br />\nto pass a human life amendment.<br />\nSince the \"ideal\" amendment, which defined a fetus as a<br />\nperson, seemed doom to fail in<br />\nthis Congress, Senator Hatch<br />\ndevised the \"Federalism Amendment.\" Purists in the so called<br />\n\"Right-to-Life\" movement have<br />\ncriticized the Hatch amendment<br />\nBut they can rest<br />\nas soft.<br />\nassured becasue the amendment<br />\nis part of a larger strategy.

The Council<br />\nhowever, prompted by the concern that the name \"Student<br />\nParliament\" might cause it to be<br />\nconfused by outsiders with the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Council, voted to from parliamentary forums and<br />\nchange the name of the group to thought that, as a neutral<br />\n\"Parliamentary Forum.\"<br />\norganization, it would serve an<br />\nDebate over acceptance of important need at Hopkins.<br />\nAfter Peifer's statement,<br />\nthe group began wnen Jeffrey<br />\nwas asked her feelings about Jeffrey reaffirmed her opposiformation of such a group. tion to the Forum.

Flynn had made this<br />\nproposal several weeks ago out<br />\nof a desire to let the Academic<br />\nCouncil and the administration<br />\nof the University know that<br />\nthe Council's opposition to<br />\nplus/minus grading is based on a<br />\nphilosophical objection, and not<br />\nselfish desires.<br />\nThough the subject had<br />\nreceived much debate in Council<br />\nin the past weeks, it received no<br />\ndiscussion this week and was<br />\ndispensed with in a matter of<br />\nminutes.<br />\n<br />\nPeifer DemandsIncreased Authority For GUS<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nPeifer goes on to recommend that \"the committee<br />\nshould be able to debate undergraduate issues in full and be<br />\nable to decide policy questions,\"<br />\nand adds that \"if the Academic<br />\nCouncil continues to do the<br />\nsame debating and deciding,<br />\nthere is no need for a Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies.\"<br />\nIn an interview with the<br />\nNews-Letter, Peifer made it clear<br />\nthat his complaints against the<br />\nAcademic Council are not simply related to just the reading<br />\nweek decision.<br />\n\"I think it's foolish for<br />\nreading week to be robbed of its<br />\npurpose; students want that full<br />\nweek to work on their term<br />\npapers and such,\" Peifer said.<br />\n\"But my letter comes out of a<br />\ngeneral feeling among C.U.S.<br />\nmembers that the Academic<br />\nCouncil doesn't listen to the<br />\nC.U.S. on any subject. It simply<br />\nredebates and re-decides everything we do.\"<br />\nPeifer cited as an example<br />\nthe Academic Council's decision<br />\nlast semester to implement Plus/<br />\nMinus grading beginning with<br />\nnext year's incoming freshmen,<br />\ndespite a student referendum<br />\nwhich opposed such a move.<br />\n\"What's at issue here is not<br />\nreading week, but the question<br />\nof faculty prerogative,\" Peifer<br />\n\"They [the Council]<br />\nsaid.<br />\naren't doing this because they<br />\nneed to schedule exams during<br />\nreading week, but because their<br />\nfeeling is, 'Hey, a professor's a<br />\nprofessor, and we should have<br />\nthe right to run our own<br />\nshow.'\"<br />\nPresident Muller has not yet<br />\nreceived Peifer's letter, but faculty members and administrators<br />\ninvolved with the issue were<br />\ncautious in their response to the<br />\nStudent Council president's<br />\ncharges. Dean of Graduate and<br />\nUndergraduate Studies Michael<br />\nHooker agreed with Peifer that<br />\nthe Academic Council could<br />\ncommunicate better with the<br />\nC.U.S., and be more respectful<br />\nof the latter's recommendations,<br />\neven if it chose to disregard<br />\nthem.<br />\n<br />\n\"I think Chuck is being<br />\nrhetorical in questioning the<br />\nneed for the C.U.S.,\" Hooker<br />\nsaid. \"I'm sure he feels as I do<br />\nthat it's essential. But I think he<br />\nis correct in his judgment that<br />\nthe Academic Council, as a<br />\nmatter of courtesy, should inform the C.U.S. of its reasons<br />\nfor denying recommendations,<br />\nand I think it would be good if<br />\nthe Academic Council invited<br />\nthe C.U.S. members to come and<br />\nexpress their judgments regarding all issues of undergraduate<br />\ncurriculum matters.\"<br />\nHooker said that regarding<br />\nthe reading week issue, he agrees<br />\nwith the C.U.S. position that no<br />\nexams or classes should be held<br />\nduring that time.<br />\n\"My personal feeling is that<br />\nit's a very valuable educational<br />\ntool,\" he said. \"At Harvard,<br />\nthe students make very good use<br />\nof it during both semesters. My<br />\npreference would be to do it<br />\nthat way at Hopkins, but I'm<br />\njust one voice, and I'm bound to<br />\nhonor the Academic Council's<br />\njudgment.\"<br />\nAcademic Council secretary<br />\nDr. Ron Walters (professor of<br />\nHistory) protested Peifer's characterization of the Academic<br />\nCouncil's attitude towards the<br />\nC.U.S. \"First of all, the C.U.S.<br />\nis not a subcommittee of the<br />\nAcademic Council. The two<br />\norganizations are separate, functioning<br />\nsemi-independently,\"<br />\nWalters said. \"I think that a<br />\ngreat deal of the time, we accept<br />\nthe advice of the C.U.S. For<br />\nexample, we basically accepted,<br />\nwith minor changes in wording,<br />\nthe two other proposals the<br />\nC.U.S. sent us along with the<br />\none on reading week. Two out<br />\nof three isn't bad.\"<br />\nThe C.U.S. had also recommended that the University<br />\nprovide coded blue books for<br />\ncourse examinations, bearing a<br />\nprinted statement about student<br />\nobligations to academic integrity. It had also proposed<br />\nrepealing the rule which states<br />\nthat independent research can<br />\nonly be graded pass/fail.<br />\nWalters said that the Academic Council regards its deci-<br />\n<br />\nsions on reading week (as well as<br />\nits decision on plus/minus grading) as a fair compromise between its own and student<br />\nopinion.<br />\n\"We didn't decide these<br />\nthings lightly in either case,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We spent a tremendous<br />\namount of time debating it, and<br />\nwe included the provision that<br />\nprofessors must give students<br />\nearly notification of their plans.<br />\nBut you have to understand that<br />\nreading week, or any change<br />\nin the calendar, is an especially<br />\ntouchy issue with the faculty.<br />\nIt's a constitutional issue with<br />\nus; there's just a very strong<br />\nresentment against any change<br />\nlike that by administrative fiat,<br />\nwithout faculty input and consent. It's important for some<br />\nfaculty to haye the flexibility<br />\nto use reading week as they need<br />\nto. Some faculty might have<br />\nresearch responsibilities away<br />\nfrom Hopkins that would compel them to leave early, and they<br />\nneed to know that they can do<br />\nthat if they need to.\"<br />\nAccording to Dean Hooker,<br />\nthe history of reading week at<br />\nHopkins is a confusing one.<br />\nHooker says that the week was<br />\ncreated when the administration<br />\nattempted to bring the spring<br />\nsemesters of the medical school<br />\nand the school of Arts and<br />\nSciences into synchronization<br />\nwith one another.<br />\n\"An extra week was added<br />\nto the Arts and Sciences calendar to achieve this synchronization,\" he said, \"but the faculty<br />\nof the Arts and Sciences objected to this lengthening of the<br />\nsemester. So we dropped that<br />\nweek of classes for them, but<br />\nthis left a week and a half gap<br />\nbetween the end of classes and<br />\nthe beginning of exams. We<br />\ncould have moved exams back,<br />\nbut then the seniors would have<br />\nhad all that time to kill between<br />\nexams and graduation, and the<br />\nsenior class organizers were<br />\nafraid that a lot of seniors<br />\nwouldn't stick around for the<br />\n'convocation ceremony, and the<br />\nOcean City trip, and the Harbor-<br />\n<br />\nplace cruise. We couldn't move<br />\ngraduation back because the<br />\nmedical school semester is longer.\"<br />\nCommenting on Hooker's<br />\ndescription of the origin of<br />\nreading week, Professor Walters<br />\nsaid that many faculty members<br />\nhad objected to the change in<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences calendar,<br />\nand questioned the need for a<br />\nreading week at all. \"We had<br />\nhad assurances from the adminis-tration, some weeks before we<br />\nreceived this last C.U.S. recommendation, that reading week<br />\nwould remain a convenience,<br />\nwith local options for faculty,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We understood it that<br />\nthose options would include<br />\nthe right to hold classes and<br />\nexams.\"<br />\nWalters said that the Academic Council expects only a<br />\nvery small number of professors<br />\nto exercise such an option. He<br />\n<br />\nadded that the Academic Council had shown its concern for the<br />\nstudents by compromising and<br />\nadding the clause about informing students early in the semester.<br />\n\"The last sentence of our<br />\ndecision is crucial,\" Walters said.<br />\n\"We recognize the professor's<br />\nresponsibility to not spring any<br />\nlate decisions on the students.\"<br />\nWalters said he is sympathetic to the feelings expressed<br />\nby Peifer, though he does not<br />\nagree with them.<br />\n\"I understand that the<br />\nC.U.S. is afraid of unfair rules<br />\nbeing slapped on the students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"But the faculty are<br />\nafraid of being slapped with<br />\nunfair rules by the administration.<br />\nWe [the students and<br />\nfaculty] see things very differently but I think the Academic<br />\nCouncil's decision tries to fairly<br />\nweigh these concerns.\"<br />\n<br />\nAti\\<br />\nDean Michael Hooker<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10 / FEBRUARY 26, 1982<br />\nouou00000000conorpoonnononnormanonnn0<br />\n<br />\nHair Cutting & Design<br />\n--For Men & Women<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\nC<br />\n\u00b0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nTA.<br />\n<br />\n00<br />\n<br />\n00000000<br />\n00000000000000000<br />\nO<br />\n0OO HAIR UNLIMITED 0<br />\n3120 Saint Paul Street<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\nr,<br />\n<br />\n235-0741<br />\n000000000000000000000000<br />\n<br />\nIf your hair isn't becoming to you!<br />\nYou should be coming to us.<br />\nLi<br />\n<br />\nCutting<br />\nStyling<br />\n100 E 33rd St 'BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues - Sat Cali<br />\n235-7083<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nBraiding, plaiting<br />\nPermanents<br />\nColoring<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nOpen Monday through Saturday 10-6<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with I D<br />\nkippers sez:<br />\n\"SURFIN` BIRD !!!!\"/I.:::<br />\n<br />\nPINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br />\n<br />\nNorthern & Szeochuan Style Cune<br />\n1011 W. 36th Street<br />\n<br />\nBEST OF LUCK<br />\n<br />\nBattimore, Maryland<br />\n<br />\nTO THE<br />\n<br />\n467-2499<br />\nWhy spend so much money<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nfor a meal at<br />\nthe other restaurants?

For recent minutes, she had watched under<br />\nnarrowed lids the tall, angular movement up the street<br />\ntake the shape of a dark-haired, strongly bearded black<br />\nman, evilly attired in a buttoned beige trench coat. The<br />\nlength of his step carried him quickly over the distance;<br />\nVickie knew that she could never outrun him. Carefully,<br />\nso as not to make it obvious, she angled her feet slightly<br />\ntowards the right, aligning them with the fine line<br />\nthat separated the sidewalk from the rounded edge of<br />\nthe curb. This, she told herself, would give her a chance<br />\nto run into the street and cross to the safety of the<br />\nopposite, empty side if it was at all necessary.<br />\nVickie felt a trickle of sweat course its way down<br />\nher wool-encased side. The bulk of her sweater hid from<br />\nview the contours of her body and left her feeling less<br />\namspicuous. However, the hot glare of the September sun<br />\nand the fear of encounter that geared her denimed<br />\nlimbs only drew the curiosity of others who wondered<br />\nwhat kind of person would wear such a sweater in such<br />\nheat.<br />\nFear was the product of those glances. It bubbled in the fine, pale hair above her upper lip glistening<br />\nuntil she was forced to draw more attention to herself<br />\nby wiping it away with a practiced finger. It sopped her<br />\nsweater with sweat and made her smell like a newly<br />\nshorn sheep. The less conspicuous she tried to be, the<br />\nmore she drew peoples' gaze.<br />\nVickie shoved her hand back into the deep<br />\npocket she had earlier drawn it out of where it joined<br />\nthe rhythmic tensing and releasing of thehand in her<br />\nother pocket. As the approaching step became audible,<br />\nshe kept her eyes rigidly fixed on the constantly repatterning cracks in the cement, waiting for the sudden<br />\nwhistle of air to announce yet another attack.

Noticing an old woman, still some blocks<br />\naway, she quickly crossed the street. Vickie disliked<br />\npassing old people almost as much as she did passing<br />\nmen. It always took them so long to go by, and they<br />\nalways made her feel guilty for being so young.<br />\nHaving to face a man on the sidewalk had always<br />\nmade her uncomfortable, but now she understood<br />\nthe very real threat that stood behind it. No man could<br />\nbe trusted on the street, not even in the light of day.<br />\nHer recent encounter brought back all too vividly that<br />\nday the month before.<br />\nAs she had walked along, oblivious to danger<br />\nwithin the crowds on the street, she had passed, and<br />\nvaguely registered the dark-eyed scrutiny of an advancing black man. It was with shock, then, that she felt his<br />\narm slip around her waist, hearing him say for the<br />\ncrowd's benefit, \"Hey, hon. Been a long time,\" and<br />\nunder his breath mutter, \"Don't you dare say a word,<br />\nbitch.\" She was half walked, half dragged down to the<br />\nfar end of the nearest alley where she was unceremoniously raped. Vickie knew someone had heard her pleas<br />\nfor help and had ignored them. She remembered how<br />\nthe rapist had leered at her where she lay sprawled<br />\nagainst the building that had served as their bed, and the<br />\n<br />\nPreservation<br />\nby Dan Vitale<br />\n\"Memory,\" Latham said. \"That's what I'm<br />\ntalking about.\" He and Greener were standing in the<br />\nstuffed-animal aisle of the Kay-Bee Toy Shop.

Fountains, their waters tinged pink with filtered<br />\nlight, geysered in the center of the mall; plants and trees<br />\nwith wet green leaves flourished everywhere: preserved,<br />\nas if in a bustling terrarium, against the winter night.<br />\n\"How many people you have left to buy for?\"<br />\nGreener asked as they entered Gimbels.<br />\n\"I'm pretty much done,\" Latham said, \"except I<br />\nwant to get one more thing for Billy. Something a little<br />\nspecial, you know, not just something Helen picked out<br />\nto be from both of us and wrote 'from Santa' on. Like<br />\nthe kid doesn't already know there isn't a Santa.\" They<br />\nstepped on the escalator. \"How about you?\"<br />\n\"Just something for my parents is all. Maybe a<br />\nlamp, or a new blonder.\"<br />\n\"How practical.\" Latham was first off the<br />\nmoving stair, and he headed for the toy department.<br />\nHe wandered down the aisles, searching. After his<br />\nfourth circuit he threw up his hands. \"Junk,\" he said.<br />\n\"I'll never find the right thing.\"<br />\n\"Exactly what are you looking for?\" Greener<br />\nasked.<br />\nHe shrugged. \"Come on, let's go find the blenders.\"<br />\n<br />\ndelight he had taken in her horrified expression as he<br />\npicked up and walked off with her clothes. His parting,<br />\n\"Not much of a lay, honey,\" had left her cringing, and<br />\nthe laughter of the people in the street at her nakedness<br />\nas she pleaded for help had demoralized her. She<br />\nrefused to trust anyone, and daylight, now, meant<br />\nnothing to safety.<br />\nAt night it was different, though. At night,<br />\nVickie would look for excuses to go walking. When a<br />\nbrisk wind rattled the windows of the apartment and<br />\nripped the aging leaves off the trees, scattering them<br />\nabout the dimly lit streets, Vickie would pull her old<br />\nbasketball sneakers out of the closet. Reverently lacing<br />\nthem up, she remembered how quickly they could send<br />\nher down the court. Those sneakers had a spirit of their<br />\nown and she trusted them more than anyone she knew;<br />\nthey had never let her down.<br />\nVickie explored the darkened streets she wouldn't dare by day. She would walk briskly, hands in<br />\npockets\u2014only to keep them warm\u2014carrying herself<br />\nvigorously and walking lightly on the balls of her feet.<br />\nShe would lose herself within the maze of streets,<br />\nchallenging all of her senses at once to keenly tune each<br />\none.

She slowed down and viewed the<br />\nalmost indiscernible figure that blended in with the<br />\nthick trunk of a tree not more than twenty yards away.<br />\nBalancing carefully on her toes, Vickie raked the shape<br />\nfor clues of sex, of strength, and most importantly, of<br />\nspeed. If he can outrun me, she thought, I'm going to<br />\nhave one hell of a time getting away. She laughed<br />\nsilently to herself, enjoying the stimulation and challenge of the situation, but wondering how she was going<br />\nto explain to the police and her mother why she was<br />\nwalking the streets alone at night after the first incident.<br />\nTheatrically, the figure suddenly detached itself<br />\nfrom the shadows and -started towards her in quick,<br />\npurposeful movements not unlike her own. Vickie felt<br />\nthe familiar tug of pain in her chest as the first shot of<br />\nadrenaline hit her, readying her for the fight. Her eyes<br />\ndarted about her surroundings for an escape route,<br />\nsimultaneously picking out additional back-ups in case<br />\nthe first failed.

In<br />\nFebruary of 1972 the Council<br />\nreceived the Final Report of the<br />\nBlue Ribbon Committee on<br />\nUndergraduate Education of The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University. In<br />\nthis report, the Committee<br />\nstated that \". . .about half of a<br />\nfaculty member's time is supposed to be spc it doing scholarly research. It is on this that he<br />\nis largely judged for promotion<br />\nand salary. . .If the quality of<br /><br />\nundergraduate teaching is to<br />\nimprove, the University must.. .<br />\n.find a broader means of evaluating faculty members in order to<br />\nreward them for meeting the<br />\nUniversity's needs.\"<br />\nThe report continued that<br />\n\"unless a broader system of<br />\nevaluation is instituted, there is<br />\nlittle chance of changing present<br />\nteaching practices.\" In light of<br />\nthis observation, which the Committee made by examining the<br />\nresults of a survey answered by<br />\nhalf of the University's undergraduates, several recommenda-<br /><br />\ntions were forwarded to the<br />\nAcademic Council. One recommendation asked that \"the University adopt appropriate methods for recognizing and rewarding quality and innovation<br />\nin teaching. We urge the formation of a faculty-student-administration committee to establish<br />\na proper system for teaching<br />\nevaluation in all undergraduate<br />\ncourses. . .We strongly urge that<br />\nevery student have an opportunity to contribute to this evaluation process and that each<br />\ndepartment take the initiative in<br /><br />\nappraising and promoting better<br />\nteaching.\" This recommendation concluded by declaring that<br />\n\"to be meaningful, we propose<br />\nthat teaching evaluation be a<br />\nsignificant component in judging<br />\nfaculty promotions and salaries.\"<br />\nIn May of 1976, the Student Council attempted to sway<br />\nthe Academic Council into revising some of its rules on tenure<br />\nand promotions. In a letter sent<br />\nto the Academic Council dated<br />\nMay 11, 1976, the Student<br />\nCouncil recommended that the<br /><br />\nmemorandum which outlines<br />\n\"procedures for consideration of<br />\nfaculty appointments and promotions\" be reworded to state<br />\nthat evaluations of a candidate's<br />\nteaching would be considered in<br />\ndetermining such advances of<br />\nfaculty members. Says the Student Council memorandum, \"Information on the candidate's<br />\nundergraduate teaching, including Course Evaluation and the<br />\nresults of other surveys by<br />\nundergraduates, when available,<br />\nshall be included in the file of<br />\nthe candidate. . .\"<br /><br />\nPSUSponsors Speakers On FinancialAid<br />\nBY SHERYL JASSEN<br /><br />\nform of federally-sponsored financial assistance.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins UniverAt a meeting this past<br />\nWednesday night, the Hopkins sity's Financial Aid Director,<br />\nProgressive Student Union (PSU) Susan Broadbent, spoke to conwelcomed two guest speakers cerned students at the PSU<br />\nwho discussed the effect the meeting. \"Financial aid has<br />\nproposed financial aid budget helped public and private institucuts will have on students and tions,\" she said. The financial<br />\nthe possible courses of action aid director described her views<br />\nthat students may take. A third on the proposed cuts and<br />\nspeaker addressed the issue of resulting figures, commenting<br />\nAffirmative Action.<br />\n\"The changes being made now<br />\nThe Reagan administration are going to be a real danger in<br />\nhas proposed massive cutbacks 1982-83.\" She countered the<br />\nin student aid programs, calling argument used by the Reagan<br />\nfor an overall funding reduction administration that there is a<br />\nof 45 percent. The 1983 budget high student default rate\u2014it's<br />\nproposal, as it presently exists, only 7.4 percent. Responding to<br />\nwill dramatically affect the the occurrence of students falseestimated 13 million college ly claiming independent status,<br />\nstudents throughout the country she noted, \"Not many here<br />\nwho,receive and rely upon some succeed in claiming independent<br /><br />\nsupport\u2014it simply doesn't happen.\"<br />\nAccording to Broadbent, as<br />\ntuition costs increase and financial aid decreases, what will<br />\nresult is less of a choice by<br />\nstudents and their families.<br />\n\"Education, like maintaining<br />\ngood health, will become a<br />\nluxury in this country, with the<br />\nmiddle class being squeezed out<br />\nof eligibility.\" At Hopkins,<br />\nBroadbent believes, aid cuts<br />\ncould lead to possible changes in<br />\nadministration policy. \"This<br />\nUniversity is concerned with<br />\nresearch: student education is<br />\nsecondary. Rather than outright<br />\njoint admissions and financial<br />\naid review, we will continue to<br />\nkeep the two separte, but the<br />\nfull aid given will be denied to<br />\nthose students who demonstrate<br />\nneed.\" She added, \"Clearly we<br />\nwill have fewer students on aid,<br />\nand in the long run, we'll have a<br />\nless diverse population than we<br />\nhave now.\" Currently, 1000 of<br />\nthe 2300 undergraduates at<br />\nHopkins receive aid directly and<br />\nthrough work-study.<br />\n\"This is the time to participate if you're going to,\" Broadbent urged. Everyone should<br />\nwrite<br />\nto<br />\nhis<br />\ncongresspeople\u2014they<br />\nneed<br />\nto<br />\nbe<br />\nstroked.\" Other ways to avoid<br />\nthe passing of the proposed<br /><br />\nbudget cuts were suggested by<br />\nanother speaker, Janice Fine, the<br />\nUnited States Students Association representative, including<br />\nobtaining voting records of the<br />\npoliticians, voting to re-elect<br />\nonly those who've favored maintaining the current aid program.<br />\n\"You may want to avail yourselves of the Official White<br />\nHouse Comment Line and tell<br />\nMr. Reagan how you feel.\"<br />\n\"The best kinds of policies<br />\nare incrementally changed\u2014not<br />\nabruptly stopped,\" she expressed. She feels that if the cut<br />\n\"goes through\u2014which it won't<br />\nbecause we're going to fight and<br />\nscream and holler,\" many students will be denied an education, \"and education is one of<br />\nthe primary rights we have.\"<br />\nA march for support of<br />\nhigher education and against the<br />\nproposed financial aid budget<br />\ncuts, is planned for Monday,<br />\nMarch 1, in Washington, D.C.<br />\nThe third speaker, Ken<br />\nMorgan, a city activist in favor<br />\nof Affirmative Action, commented on the absence of a<br />\nstrong Affirmative Action policy<br />\nat Hopkins.

In attempting to<br />\nstudy at the library for the<br />\nrecent Organic Chemistry exam,<br />\nI found it virtually impossible<br />\nto answer any questions about<br />\ntopics that were not fully<br />\ncovered in my notes.<br />\nThe other problem deals<br />\nwith the only real study aid<br />\navailable. I am referring to past<br /><br />\nexams that are on file. While the<br />\nexams are easily accessible, I was<br />\ndisturbed by their poor conditions. Almost all of them were<br />\nmarked by past users who either<br />\nwrote the answers next to the<br />\nquestion (which makes it difficult to test yourself) or actually marked the questions so that<br />\nit was impossible to understand<br />\nwhat was being asked.

Last September,<br />\nSenator Orrin Hatch introduced<br />\na \"Federalism Amendment\" to<br />\nthe Constitution, designed to<br />\nban abortions. A Constitutional<br />\nAmendment is required to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court<br />\ndecision in Roe vs. Wade that<br />\nruled a woman's right to choose<br />\nan abortion is guaranteed by the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nHatch's amendment, the<br />\nnewest proposal for a Constitutional ban on abortions, is<br />\nscheduled for a vote in the<br />\nSenate Judiciary Committee<br />\nnext Wednesday, March 3.

Like<br />\nprevious \"human life\" amendments, Hatch's proposal would<br />\noverturn the 1973 Supreme<br />\nCourt decision and, a careful<br />\nreading of the full text demonstrates the fallacy of believing<br />\nthis is a moderate bill: \"A right<br />\nto abortion is not secured by<br />\nthis Constitution.

In fact, a<br />\nmemorandum circulated among<br />\n\"pro-life\" groups stated that \"...<br />\nright-to-life leaders are far less<br />\noptimistic about the possibility<br />\nof passing and ratifying the ideal<br />\namendment in the foreseeable<br />\nfuture than they care to admit in<br />\npublic.\" According to their own<br />\nfigures, anti-abortionists have 51<br />\nof 67 votes needed in the Senate<br />\nto pass a human life amendment.<br />\nSince the \"ideal\" amendment, which defined a fetus as a<br />\nperson, seemed doom to fail in<br />\nthis Congress, Senator Hatch<br />\ndevised the \"Federalism Amendment.\" Purists in the so called<br />\n\"Right-to-Life\" movement have<br />\ncriticized the Hatch amendment<br />\nBut they can rest<br />\nas soft.<br />\nassured becasue the amendment<br />\nis part of a larger strategy.

Opposition<br />\nto the acceptance of the charter<br />\nwas led by Deborah Jeffrey,<br />\nchairman of the Students Activities Committee, which approved<br />\nthe charter despite her objections.<br />\nThe Parliamentary Forum,<br />\nled by Grant Lally, a junior, is<br />\nbased on a similar organization<br />\nfounded at Johns Hopkins by<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, the 28th President of the United States, then<br />\na graduate student here. Lally<br />\nstated at the meeting that he had<br />\npicked the name \"Student Parliament\" for the group as it<br />\nwould provide continuity between the new group and that of<br />\nPresident Wilson. The Council<br />\nhowever, prompted by the concern that the name \"Student<br />\nParliament\" might cause it to be<br />\nconfused by outsiders with the<br /><br />\nStudent Council, voted to from parliamentary forums and<br />\nchange the name of the group to thought that, as a neutral<br />\n\"Parliamentary Forum.\"<br />\norganization, it would serve an<br />\nDebate over acceptance of important need at Hopkins.<br />\nAfter Peifer's statement,<br />\nthe group began wnen Jeffrey<br />\nwas asked her feelings about Jeffrey reaffirmed her opposiformation of such a group. tion to the Forum.

Unlike a Class A group, a<br /><br />\nClass B group cannot ask the<br />\nSAC to fund its annual budget.<br />\nIt may only ask the SAC for aid<br />\nin financing special events.<br />\nIn other business, the Council voted 11 to 7 to 3 to accept a<br />\nmotion made by Colin Flynn to<br />\nexpress continued opposition to<br />\nplus/minus grading, and to send<br />\nletters to all appropriate parties<br />\ninforming them of the Council's<br />\nposition. Flynn had made this<br />\nproposal several weeks ago out<br />\nof a desire to let the Academic<br />\nCouncil and the administration<br />\nof the University know that<br />\nthe Council's opposition to<br />\nplus/minus grading is based on a<br />\nphilosophical objection, and not<br />\nselfish desires.<br />\nThough the subject had<br />\nreceived much debate in Council<br />\nin the past weeks, it received no<br />\ndiscussion this week and was<br />\ndispensed with in a matter of<br />\nminutes.<br /><br />\nPeifer DemandsIncreased Authority For GUS<br />\ncont. from p. 1<br />\nPeifer goes on to recommend that \"the committee<br />\nshould be able to debate undergraduate issues in full and be<br />\nable to decide policy questions,\"<br />\nand adds that \"if the Academic<br />\nCouncil continues to do the<br />\nsame debating and deciding,<br />\nthere is no need for a Committee<br />\non Undergraduate Studies.\"<br />\nIn an interview with the<br />\nNews-Letter, Peifer made it clear<br />\nthat his complaints against the<br />\nAcademic Council are not simply related to just the reading<br />\nweek decision.<br />\n\"I think it's foolish for<br />\nreading week to be robbed of its<br />\npurpose; students want that full<br />\nweek to work on their term<br />\npapers and such,\" Peifer said.<br />\n\"But my letter comes out of a<br />\ngeneral feeling among C.U.S.<br />\nmembers that the Academic<br />\nCouncil doesn't listen to the<br />\nC.U.S. on any subject. It simply<br />\nredebates and re-decides everything we do.\"<br />\nPeifer cited as an example<br />\nthe Academic Council's decision<br />\nlast semester to implement Plus/<br />\nMinus grading beginning with<br />\nnext year's incoming freshmen,<br />\ndespite a student referendum<br />\nwhich opposed such a move.<br />\n\"What's at issue here is not<br />\nreading week, but the question<br />\nof faculty prerogative,\" Peifer<br />\n\"They [the Council]<br />\nsaid.<br />\naren't doing this because they<br />\nneed to schedule exams during<br />\nreading week, but because their<br />\nfeeling is, 'Hey, a professor's a<br />\nprofessor, and we should have<br />\nthe right to run our own<br />\nshow.'\"<br />\nPresident Muller has not yet<br />\nreceived Peifer's letter, but faculty members and administrators<br />\ninvolved with the issue were<br />\ncautious in their response to the<br />\nStudent Council president's<br />\ncharges. Dean of Graduate and<br />\nUndergraduate Studies Michael<br />\nHooker agreed with Peifer that<br />\nthe Academic Council could<br />\ncommunicate better with the<br />\nC.U.S., and be more respectful<br />\nof the latter's recommendations,<br />\neven if it chose to disregard<br />\nthem.<br /><br />\n\"I think Chuck is being<br />\nrhetorical in questioning the<br />\nneed for the C.U.S.,\" Hooker<br />\nsaid. \"I'm sure he feels as I do<br />\nthat it's essential. But I think he<br />\nis correct in his judgment that<br />\nthe Academic Council, as a<br />\nmatter of courtesy, should inform the C.U.S. of its reasons<br />\nfor denying recommendations,<br />\nand I think it would be good if<br />\nthe Academic Council invited<br />\nthe C.U.S. members to come and<br />\nexpress their judgments regarding all issues of undergraduate<br />\ncurriculum matters.\"<br />\nHooker said that regarding<br />\nthe reading week issue, he agrees<br />\nwith the C.U.S. position that no<br />\nexams or classes should be held<br />\nduring that time.<br />\n\"My personal feeling is that<br />\nit's a very valuable educational<br />\ntool,\" he said. \"At Harvard,<br />\nthe students make very good use<br />\nof it during both semesters. My<br />\npreference would be to do it<br />\nthat way at Hopkins, but I'm<br />\njust one voice, and I'm bound to<br />\nhonor the Academic Council's<br />\njudgment.\"<br />\nAcademic Council secretary<br />\nDr. Ron Walters (professor of<br />\nHistory) protested Peifer's characterization of the Academic<br />\nCouncil's attitude towards the<br />\nC.U.S. \"First of all, the C.U.S.<br />\nis not a subcommittee of the<br />\nAcademic Council. The two<br />\norganizations are separate, functioning<br />\nsemi-independently,\"<br />\nWalters said. \"I think that a<br />\ngreat deal of the time, we accept<br />\nthe advice of the C.U.S. For<br />\nexample, we basically accepted,<br />\nwith minor changes in wording,<br />\nthe two other proposals the<br />\nC.U.S. sent us along with the<br />\none on reading week. Two out<br />\nof three isn't bad.\"<br />\nThe C.U.S. had also recommended that the University<br />\nprovide coded blue books for<br />\ncourse examinations, bearing a<br />\nprinted statement about student<br />\nobligations to academic integrity. It had also proposed<br />\nrepealing the rule which states<br />\nthat independent research can<br />\nonly be graded pass/fail.<br />\nWalters said that the Academic Council regards its deci-<br /><br />\nsions on reading week (as well as<br />\nits decision on plus/minus grading) as a fair compromise between its own and student<br />\nopinion.<br />\n\"We didn't decide these<br />\nthings lightly in either case,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"We spent a tremendous<br />\namount of time debating it, and<br />\nwe included the provision that<br />\nprofessors must give students<br />\nearly notification of their plans.<br />\nBut you have to understand that<br />\nreading week, or any change<br />\nin the calendar, is an especially<br />\ntouchy issue with the faculty.<br />\nIt's a constitutional issue with<br />\nus; there's just a very strong<br />\nresentment against any change<br />\nlike that by administrative fiat,<br />\nwithout faculty input and consent. It's important for some<br />\nfaculty to haye the flexibility<br />\nto use reading week as they need<br />\nto. Some faculty might have<br />\nresearch responsibilities away<br />\nfrom Hopkins that would compel them to leave early, and they<br />\nneed to know that they can do<br />\nthat if they need to.\"<br />\nAccording to Dean Hooker,<br />\nthe history of reading week at<br />\nHopkins is a confusing one.<br />\nHooker says that the week was<br />\ncreated when the administration<br />\nattempted to bring the spring<br />\nsemesters of the medical school<br />\nand the school of Arts and<br />\nSciences into synchronization<br />\nwith one another.<br />\n\"An extra week was added<br />\nto the Arts and Sciences calendar to achieve this synchronization,\" he said, \"but the faculty<br />\nof the Arts and Sciences objected to this lengthening of the<br />\nsemester. So we dropped that<br />\nweek of classes for them, but<br />\nthis left a week and a half gap<br />\nbetween the end of classes and<br />\nthe beginning of exams. We<br />\ncould have moved exams back,<br />\nbut then the seniors would have<br />\nhad all that time to kill between<br />\nexams and graduation, and the<br />\nsenior class organizers were<br />\nafraid that a lot of seniors<br />\nwouldn't stick around for the<br />\n'convocation ceremony, and the<br />\nOcean City trip, and the Harbor-<br /><br />\nplace cruise. We couldn't move<br />\ngraduation back because the<br />\nmedical school semester is longer.\"<br />\nCommenting on Hooker's<br />\ndescription of the origin of<br />\nreading week, Professor Walters<br />\nsaid that many faculty members<br />\nhad objected to the change in<br />\nthe Arts and Sciences calendar,<br />\nand questioned the need for a<br />\nreading week at all. \"We had<br />\nhad assurances from the adminis-tration, some weeks before we<br />\nreceived this last C.U.S. recommendation, that reading week<br />\nwould remain a convenience,<br />\nwith local options for faculty,\"<br />\nhe said. \"We understood it that<br />\nthose options would include<br />\nthe right to hold classes and<br />\nexams.\"<br />\nWalters said that the Academic Council expects only a<br />\nvery small number of professors<br />\nto exercise such an option. He<br /><br />\nadded that the Academic Council had shown its concern for the<br />\nstudents by compromising and<br />\nadding the clause about informing students early in the semester.<br />\n\"The last sentence of our<br />\ndecision is crucial,\" Walters said.<br />\n\"We recognize the professor's<br />\nresponsibility to not spring any<br />\nlate decisions on the students.\"<br />\nWalters said he is sympathetic to the feelings expressed<br />\nby Peifer, though he does not<br />\nagree with them.<br />\n\"I understand that the<br />\nC.U.S. is afraid of unfair rules<br />\nbeing slapped on the students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"But the faculty are<br />\nafraid of being slapped with<br />\nunfair rules by the administration.<br />\nWe [the students and<br />\nfaculty] see things very differently but I think the Academic<br />\nCouncil's decision tries to fairly<br />\nweigh these concerns.\"<br /><br />\nAti\\<br />\nDean Michael Hooker<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 / FEBRUARY 26, 1982<br />\nouou00000000conorpoonnononnormanonnn0<br /><br />\nHair Cutting &amp; Design<br />\n--For Men &amp; Women<br /><br />\nr<br />\nC<br />\n\u00b0<br />\n0<br /><br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n0<br /><br />\nTA.<br /><br />\n00<br /><br />\n00000000<br />\n00000000000000000<br />\nO<br />\n0OO HAIR UNLIMITED 0<br />\n3120 Saint Paul Street<br /><br />\n0<br />\n0<br />\nr,<br /><br />\n235-0741<br />\n000000000000000000000000<br /><br />\nIf your hair isn't becoming to you!<br />\nYou should be coming to us.<br />\nLi<br /><br />\nCutting<br />\nStyling<br />\n100 E 33rd St 'BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues - Sat Cali<br />\n235-7083<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nBraiding, plaiting<br />\nPermanents<br />\nColoring<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nOpen Monday through Saturday 10-6<br /><br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with I D<br />\nkippers sez:<br />\n\"SURFIN` BIRD !!!!\"/I.:::<br /><br />\nPINE BROOK CHINESE RESTAURANT<br /><br />\nNorthern &amp; Szeochuan Style Cune<br />\n1011 W. 36th Street<br /><br />\nBEST OF LUCK<br /><br />\nBattimore, Maryland<br /><br />\nTO THE<br /><br />\n467-2499<br />\nWhy spend so much money<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nfor a meal at<br />\nthe other restaurants?

After the first four semesters here it is<br />\nalways perfect. I talked with several of the under- impossible not to be in a course with the same professor<br />\ngraduate writers at Hopkins and tried to get a good feel again, sometimes in exactly the same course. Some<br />\nfor the unique opportunities and disadvantages for them<br />\nrealized the asset of having a professor more than once<br />\nat this school. I also asked each writer I spoke with to in terms of his being able to follow the development of<br />\nsubmit a brief, hut representative sample of their writ- style, but all wished for more variety. \"If you want to<br />\ning. These works are interspersed throughout the article; take a Writing Seminars course every semester you'll end<br />\nmost of them have already been presented at public up in the same course again.\" Said one poet,\"There are<br />\nreadings.<br />\nreal advantages to having the same teacher in terms of<br />\nstyle, etcetera, but there's something to be said for<br />\nrf b<br />\nvariety.\"<br />\nFISHNET DREAM<br />\nOne playwright said: \"I wish there was a teacher<br />\nin the undergraduate seminars who was a well-known<br />\nOnce, as I was walking down the road<br />\nplaywright or screenwriter.

Cay Whitley is one of the<br />\nwriters who opted to study in the English department.<br />\nShe explains: \"My CAL teacher, freshman year, recommended that I read before I try to write. So I study<br />\nliterature before I try to blaze new trails.\" Bonni Goldberg, although in the Writing Seminars department,<br />\nagrees with this strategy: \"I think the requirements for<br />\nthe curriculum are faulty\u2014they don't require enough<br />\nEnglish lit. I found myself a junior in college without<br />\nhaving read any of the great poets. I think they ought to<br />\nrequire more lit.\"<br />\nAs to the opportunities for exposure available to<br />\nwriters, opinion varies. The Knight Dunlap Memorial<br />\nReading Series is considered to be a very useful and<br />\nsuccessful project. This year it is being run by George<br />\nYatchisin and Matt Roshkow, two sophomore Seminars<br />\nmajors. Yatchisin said, \"We have a good crowd of<br />\npeople.

For recent minutes, she had watched under<br />\nnarrowed lids the tall, angular movement up the street<br />\ntake the shape of a dark-haired, strongly bearded black<br />\nman, evilly attired in a buttoned beige trench coat. The<br />\nlength of his step carried him quickly over the distance;<br />\nVickie knew that she could never outrun him. Carefully,<br />\nso as not to make it obvious, she angled her feet slightly<br />\ntowards the right, aligning them with the fine line<br />\nthat separated the sidewalk from the rounded edge of<br />\nthe curb. This, she told herself, would give her a chance<br />\nto run into the street and cross to the safety of the<br />\nopposite, empty side if it was at all necessary.<br />\nVickie felt a trickle of sweat course its way down<br />\nher wool-encased side. The bulk of her sweater hid from<br />\nview the contours of her body and left her feeling less<br />\namspicuous. However, the hot glare of the September sun<br />\nand the fear of encounter that geared her denimed<br />\nlimbs only drew the curiosity of others who wondered<br />\nwhat kind of person would wear such a sweater in such<br />\nheat.<br />\nFear was the product of those glances. It bubbled in the fine, pale hair above her upper lip glistening<br />\nuntil she was forced to draw more attention to herself<br />\nby wiping it away with a practiced finger. It sopped her<br />\nsweater with sweat and made her smell like a newly<br />\nshorn sheep. The less conspicuous she tried to be, the<br />\nmore she drew peoples' gaze.<br />\nVickie shoved her hand back into the deep<br />\npocket she had earlier drawn it out of where it joined<br />\nthe rhythmic tensing and releasing of thehand in her<br />\nother pocket. As the approaching step became audible,<br />\nshe kept her eyes rigidly fixed on the constantly repatterning cracks in the cement, waiting for the sudden<br />\nwhistle of air to announce yet another attack.

Noticing an old woman, still some blocks<br />\naway, she quickly crossed the street. Vickie disliked<br />\npassing old people almost as much as she did passing<br />\nmen. It always took them so long to go by, and they<br />\nalways made her feel guilty for being so young.<br />\nHaving to face a man on the sidewalk had always<br />\nmade her uncomfortable, but now she understood<br />\nthe very real threat that stood behind it. No man could<br />\nbe trusted on the street, not even in the light of day.<br />\nHer recent encounter brought back all too vividly that<br />\nday the month before.<br />\nAs she had walked along, oblivious to danger<br />\nwithin the crowds on the street, she had passed, and<br />\nvaguely registered the dark-eyed scrutiny of an advancing black man. It was with shock, then, that she felt his<br />\narm slip around her waist, hearing him say for the<br />\ncrowd's benefit, \"Hey, hon. Been a long time,\" and<br />\nunder his breath mutter, \"Don't you dare say a word,<br />\nbitch.\" She was half walked, half dragged down to the<br />\nfar end of the nearest alley where she was unceremoniously raped. Vickie knew someone had heard her pleas<br />\nfor help and had ignored them. She remembered how<br />\nthe rapist had leered at her where she lay sprawled<br />\nagainst the building that had served as their bed, and the<br /><br />\nPreservation<br />\nby Dan Vitale<br />\n\"Memory,\" Latham said. \"That's what I'm<br />\ntalking about.\" He and Greener were standing in the<br />\nstuffed-animal aisle of the Kay-Bee Toy Shop. A sign<br />\nnearby announced that only three shopping days remained until Christmas.<br />\nGreener was turning a flop-eared dog over in his<br />\nhands. \"You're saying you can't remember anything<br />\nabout your father?\"<br />\n\"Hardly anything,\" Latham said. \"That's what's<br />\nbothering me.\" He checked the price tag on a fiv-e-foot<br />\ntall Donald Duck. \"Fourteen years I was alive before he<br />\ndied, and I can barely picture his face, for Christ's sake.\"<br />\n\"Maybe it's just a mental block.\"<br />\nHe returned the duck to the shelf. \"You getting<br />\nanything here?\"<br />\n\"Nah.\"<br />\nThey walked back out onto the mall and rejoined<br />\nthe current of shoppers surging in and out of stores the<br />\nlength of the glass-enclosed plaza, passing beneath<br />\nelaborate constellations of holiday bulbs and golden<br />\ntinsel. Fountains, their waters tinged pink with filtered<br />\nlight, geysered in the center of the mall; plants and trees<br />\nwith wet green leaves flourished everywhere: preserved,<br />\nas if in a bustling terrarium, against the winter night.<br />\n\"How many people you have left to buy for?\"<br />\nGreener asked as they entered Gimbels.<br />\n\"I'm pretty much done,\" Latham said, \"except I<br />\nwant to get one more thing for Billy. Something a little<br />\nspecial, you know, not just something Helen picked out<br />\nto be from both of us and wrote 'from Santa' on. Like<br />\nthe kid doesn't already know there isn't a Santa.\" They<br />\nstepped on the escalator. \"How about you?\"<br />\n\"Just something for my parents is all. Maybe a<br />\nlamp, or a new blonder.\"<br />\n\"How practical.\" Latham was first off the<br />\nmoving stair, and he headed for the toy department.<br />\nHe wandered down the aisles, searching. After his<br />\nfourth circuit he threw up his hands. \"Junk,\" he said.<br />\n\"I'll never find the right thing.\"<br />\n\"Exactly what are you looking for?\" Greener<br />\nasked.<br />\nHe shrugged. \"Come on, let's go find the blenders.\"<br /><br />\ndelight he had taken in her horrified expression as he<br />\npicked up and walked off with her clothes. His parting,<br />\n\"Not much of a lay, honey,\" had left her cringing, and<br />\nthe laughter of the people in the street at her nakedness<br />\nas she pleaded for help had demoralized her. She<br />\nrefused to trust anyone, and daylight, now, meant<br />\nnothing to safety.<br />\nAt night it was different, though. At night,<br />\nVickie would look for excuses to go walking. When a<br />\nbrisk wind rattled the windows of the apartment and<br />\nripped the aging leaves off the trees, scattering them<br />\nabout the dimly lit streets, Vickie would pull her old<br />\nbasketball sneakers out of the closet. Reverently lacing<br />\nthem up, she remembered how quickly they could send<br />\nher down the court. Those sneakers had a spirit of their<br />\nown and she trusted them more than anyone she knew;<br />\nthey had never let her down.<br />\nVickie explored the darkened streets she wouldn't dare by day.
