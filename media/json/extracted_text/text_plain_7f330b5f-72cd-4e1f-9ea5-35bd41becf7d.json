Of the three<br />\nconcerts held, two came off<br />\nbeautifully and one almost ended<br />\nin disaster. The Student Council<br />\nand the Junior Class (Flying<br />\nMonkey) sponsored concerts on<br />\nSaturday and Sunday afternoon<br />\nwith near perfect results. The<br />\nweather was beautiful, the crowds<br />\nwere large, the music was good and<br />\nabove all we received no<br />\ncomplaints because of noise. On<br />\nSunday evening the Chaplain's<br />\noffice sponsored a loud rock show.<br />\nA number of problems were<br />\ncreated; 1) the concert was never<br />\nadvertised to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, yet Hopkins facilities<br />\nwere used. 2) The Dean of<br />\nStudent si Office, the Student<br />\nCouncil and even the Campus<br />\nPolice on duty that weekend were<br />\nnot informed of the concert. 3)<br />\nThe quad in front of Gilman Hall<br />\nwas left in one pile of trash and<br />\nbroken bottles after the Flying<br />\nMonkey Concert had left the quad<br />\nspotless in th- ..fternoon. Because<br />\nof the Chaplain's lack of<br />\nforethought in telling other people<br />\nof this concert he had to suffer<br />\nthrough many problems and the<br />\nscorn of many people.<br />\nThe Student Council has found<br />\nthrough many painful experiences<br />\nthat an outdoor night time rock<br />\nconcert cannot be run on this<br />\ncampus. Speaking to Dr. Wickwire<br />\nbefore the concert I told him that<br />\n<br />\nthe police would come to close the<br />\nconcert down within 45 minutes<br />\nafter it began and needless to say<br />\nthat prediction came painfully<br />\ntrue. I also told him that if he<br />\ndidn't have his people clean up the<br />\nquad it would never be cleaned and<br />\nagain the quad was a sea of broken<br />\nbottles and beer cans. The most<br />\nserious side of the whole evening<br />\nwere the complaints of loud noise<br />\ncoming from as far away as<br />\nGreenmount Ave. Complaints were<br />\nso serious that even Dr. Muller<br />\nreceived ten phone complaints and<br />\nDean Benton came on campus to<br />\nsee where the noise was coming<br />\nfrom.<br />\nA week ago, the Student<br />\nCouncil spent many thousands of<br />\ndollars in an Arts Festival to<br />\nincrease community relations and<br />\nthe Chaplain in one thoughtless<br />\nmove trys to undo all that :,vork<br />\nand possibly ruin future outdoor<br />\nconcerts. I'm not saying that the<br />\nChaplain shouldn't sponsor events,<br />\nbut the least he could do is<br />\ndo-ordinate them with other<br />\nstudent groups that have had<br />\nexperience in these matters. If he is<br />\nunwilling to work with these other<br />\ngroups then he should make some<br />\narrangements to see that the<br />\nuniversity and the people in it<br />\ndon't have to suffer the pains of<br />\ncommunity complaints and the<br />\ndefiling of the campus.<br />\nBob Murcko<br />\nStudent Council Rep.<br />\nClass of 1973<br />\n<br />\nCommittee on Un-American<br />\nActivities, or in the American<br />\nLegion Firing Line series.

Folders in the<br />\noffice are labeled \"Civil Right,\"<br />\n\"Indians,\" \"Freedom,\"<br />\n\"Anti-Semitism,\" and on and on.<br />\nTwo trips explain a lot of the<br />\ncommittees. In '61, Wickwire<br />\nattended the Eichman trial and<br />\ntraveled through the Arab<br />\ncountries, Poland, and<br />\nCzechoslavakia. The next summer<br />\na group of students participated<br />\nwith him in an exchange program<br />\nwith Russian students.

JOHNSON<br />\nThe No. 1 ranked Johns<br />\nHopkins Blue Jays maintained<br />\ntheir undefeated record by<br />\nhandling the Brown Bruins<br />\nSaturday, 18-7. Playing at Brown<br />\nStadium for the first time, the<br />\nJays treated a crowd of 6,000 to<br />\na display of tight defense and<br />\nawesome scoring power.<br />\nHopkins started off quickly,<br />\nscoring within the first minute<br />\nwhen Franz Wittelsberger fed<br />\nJack Thomas for a midfield<br />\nbounceshot. The teams traded<br />\ngoals until late in the first period<br />\nwhen the Blue Jays exploded to<br />\nan 8-2 margein.<br />\nThe second period was<br />\ncharacterized by tough defense on<br />\nboth sides. The only score of the<br />\nperiod came on an extra-man<br />\nsituation after goalie Les<br />\nMatthews was called for tripping<br />\non a clear.<br />\nHopkins put the game out of<br />\nreach in the third quarter by<br />\n<br />\noutscoring the Bruins, 7-2. The<br />\nhighlight of the period was a<br />\nthree goal spurt within 50<br />\nseconds by crease attackman Don<br />\nKrohn.<br />\nCoach Bob Scott cleared the<br />\nbench .in the fourth quarter and<br />\nmidfielder Phil Calderome took<br />\nadvantage of the opportunity,<br />\nscoring the final two goals of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nBrown played a much better<br />\ngame than the 18-7 final<br />\nindicates. Thr Bruins were the<br />\nfirst team this year to win more<br />\nface-offs and to outshoot the<br />\nB.J.'s. During the first period an<br />\nalarming number of Brown<br />\nmidfield cutters were receiving<br />\nfeeds close to the crease. Only<br />\nMatthews' superb goaltending<br />\nand Brown's consistent<br />\ninaccuracy prevented any<br />\nslimmer margin. The close<br />\ndefense played a very strong<br />\ngame, though, proving that last<br />\nweek's performance against<br />\n<br />\nJqck Thomas nets first goal ofBrown game<br />\n<br />\nVirginia was a true indication of<br />\nthe unit's ability to stop<br />\nopposing attackmen. The<br />\nmidfield defense will have to<br />\nimprove, however, in order to<br />\nhold down teams with strong<br />\nmidfields, such as Maryland.<br />\nThe offense once again<br />\ndisplayed why the Blue Jays are<br />\nthe top-ranked team in ,the<br />\nnation. Krohn had a field day<br />\nwith 6 goals and one assist. Billy<br />\nNolan, who has recently been<br />\nsuffering a scoring slump. got<br />\nback on the right track with<br />\nthree tallies. The midfield line of<br />\nDave Slafkofski, Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon, and Mike Perez<br />\nadded a strong contribution of 5<br />\npoints. They worked impressively<br />\nas a unit, both on offense and on<br />\ndefense. Thomas, continuing his<br />\ndual role as an attackman and a<br />\nmidfielder, sand 2 goals and six<br />\nartistic assists.<br />\nThe game was hard played<br />\nthroughout, and Brown never<br />\ngave up. The rough play resulted<br />\nin late game injuries to the two<br />\nco-captains. Matthews came out<br />\nof the goal on a fast break and<br />\ngave the lead man a devastating<br />\ncheck to avert a sure goal. But in<br />\nthe process, he injured his right<br />\nshoulder. Jim Ferguson, who<br />\nkept Brown's top attackman<br />\nfrom scoring all game, reinjured<br />\nhis shoulder and had to leave the<br />\ngame. However, according to<br />\nTrainer Leroy Brandimore, both<br />\ninjuries are considered to be<br />\nminor, and the co-captains are<br />\nexpected to be ready for this<br />\nSaturday's encounter against<br />\nArm at West Point.<br />\n<br />\nACCELERATE<br />\n<br />\nENRICH<br />\n<br />\n4'<br />\n'N<br />\nf<br />\n,Sr<br />\n<br />\nKen Winegrad scores on extra-man play<br />\n<br />\nJ.

The one<br />\nbright spot of the game was the<br />\nplay of goalie Mike Godack, who<br />\ncontinually turned aside the<br />\nlowedh.is defenders freely<br />\nshots<br />\nal<br />\n<br />\nAfter lying idle for almost two<br />\nweeks, the Johns Hopkins \"B\"<br />\nlacrosse team returned to action<br />\nwith two games last week.

Primarily we hope to<br />\nhelp students choose the type of courses they want by providing them<br />\nmore information on the courses and their professors. Secondarily, we<br />\nhope to provide a medium of communication between students and faculty members in the hope that professors would take note of the student opinion (albeit somewhat subjective) of the effectiveness of their<br />\nteaching.<br />\nThe Course Guide this semester incorporates new reviews offirst semester courses and the latest professors' descriptions available. In order to<br />\nprovide the fullest possible coverage of course offerings, reviews of professors written from material on other courses taught by the same professor have been included. They are clearly marked as such. Additionally, some reprints of previous reviews of the same professor teaching the<br />\nsame course have been included. A new feature of the Course Guide this<br />\nsemester is the inclusion, (where information was available) of a breakdown by class of students in a course. We feel that this is of value not<br />\nonly in putting student reviews into perspective, but also in indicating<br />\nthe sorts of students one might encounter in an upcoming version of the<br />\ncourse. Please bear in mind that those distributions by class are liable to<br />\nchange in any semester. Finally, the Course Guide has resurected (also<br />\nwhere information was available) the policy of publishing questionnaire<br />\nresponse ratios. We were pleased with the results of not only the new<br />\nquestionnaires, but the new method of their distribution.<br />\nA note here may be made about the Student Council Teacher Evaluation (Teaval) program to whose computer punch card questionnaires<br />\nyou have already been subjected. The Course Guide firmly endorses such<br />\nnumerical analyses, but would like to point out that it and the Teaval<br />\nate either working at cross purposes nor duplicating effort. The Teaval<br />\nhas considerable importance as a tool for evaluating the quality of undergraduate teaching at Hopkins. The Course Guide aims more at providing on a semester to semester basis, the latest in professor's statements<br />\n- regarding a course and an already-digested analysis of student opinion of<br />\nprevious versions of the course.<br />\nFinally, the editors would like to express their gratitude to those who<br />\nhelped make this semester's Course Guide possible: the Hopkins NewsLetter for the use of their composition equipment and dark room facilities; the Registrar's office for all the information which they provided<br />\nus, the duplication department of Garland Hall for their assistance with<br />\ngeneral printing; and finally, all the professors who submitted statements<br />\nand allowed their students time in class to receive and complete questionaires.<br />\n<br />\nEditors<br />\nAssociate Editors<br />\nPhoto Editor<br />\nLayout Editor<br />\n<br />\nMark H Barth, John Broughton<br />\nJannette M Berg, Kenneth P Smith<br />\nMichael Bloch<br />\nBertha Polin<br />\n<br />\nstaff: Lloyd Berkowitz, C.

In this course, there is I lecture<br />\nper week with Dr. Berger or Dr. Hartman, 1<br />\nconference with a grad student, and 3 hours of<br />\nlaboratory per week. The student's grade is<br />\nbased upon a 2 hour final and the lab notebooks. The professors have attempted to keep<br />\nthroating to a minimum by establishing a set<br />\ngrade scale and not curving the course. In the<br />\nlabs, the students worked with bacteria and viruses in order to gain insight into the fundamental problems in biology. According to past<br />\nstudents, the lectures were at times overdetailed, tedious, and boring. The students felt<br />\nboth professors adequate lecturers although<br />\nthere were times when Dr. Hartman seemed to<br />\nbe talking to the wall rather than his students.<br />\nThe students last year, however, were full of<br />\npraise for the grad students and the laboratory<br />\nwork. They felt that the experiments were interesting and fun. Also, the graduate students<br />\nwere excellent in their presentation of experimental information and were deemed very fair<br />\nin the grading of the lab books. Thus, World of<br />\nMicrobes is a course designed for non-science<br />\nmajors who can still gain satisfaction from<br />\nworking in microbiology.<br />\n<br />\n2.5 FRESHMAN SEMINARS<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nAll Freshmen<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n16/16<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Seliger's freshman seminar was enthusiastically received by nearly all<br />\nrespondents. The only students who expressed<br />\nsome hesitation about the course were those<br />\nwho felt the course over their heads. However,<br />\nwith the only requirement being a ten-minute<br />\ntalk, one can glean from the lectures what one<br />\nis interested in. Many students commented on<br />\nthe scholarliness of Dr. Seliger and noted his<br />\nreal interest in the course.<br />\nThe only weaknesses noted by the students<br />\nwere in regard to the rather complicated<br />\n(though not excessively long) readings and the<br />\naccessibility of the professor. While some students seemed to be able to find Dr. Seliger,<br />\nmost reflected the sentiment expressed in various remarks: \"he did his best to fit us into his<br />\nschedule\" and \"the instructor was available for<br />\nquestioning in his office ... however, he was seldom in his office.\" Overall, students enthusiastically recommended the course.<br />\nThe professor's \"Organization of Course\"<br />\nmaterial noted that high school biology and<br />\nchemistry were the only prerequisites and that<br />\na seminar format would be used.<br />\n<br />\n2.307 CELLULAR AND<br />\nCOMPARITIVE BIOCHEMISTRY<br />\nDrs. Brand,Nason, & Bessman<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nSpecial U G<br />\nFreshman<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nSpring 1973<br />\n3<br />\n68<br />\n19<br />\n17<br />\n.8<br />\n120<br />\n29/1 20<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: As usual, Biochem was<br />\nwell received by most of the respondents; only<br />\na couple of them panned the course. The text<br />\nwas rated from good to excellent, the workload<br />\nof two to five hours per week was considered<br />\nfair, and, in most cases, the credits were considered appropriate. Respondents also had a generally favorable rating for the lectures, although<br />\nthis depended on the lecturer.<br />\nTests were the most poorly received part of<br />\nthe course; many students complaining of the<br />\nexcessive detail necessary to do well, and the<br />\nsometimes subjective grading of the grad students in Biology. It is a measure of the course's<br />\nsuccess, however, that this, the weak point, was<br />\nstill well received by about half the respondents. The only other weak point was some of<br />\nthe lectures given by Dr. Nason, Brand, and<br />\nKundig. Even then, only a few students didn't<br />\nlike Dr. Nason, and a few found the accents of<br />\nDrs. Brand and Kundig difficult to understand.<br />\nIn general, after all the complaints, people<br />\nstill recommended Biochem. A course possible<br />\nto take for a grade; perhaps more prudent to<br />\ntake Pass/Fail.<br />\n<br />\n2.319 BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS<br />\nDr. Edidin<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Biology, rich in particulars, is poor in theories. The course aims to present an exposition of the most powerful and<br />\nmost general theory of biology, evolution by<br />\nnatural selection.<br />\nLectures will introduce the range of animal<br />\nand plant forms now extant, and discuss approaches to classification of these forms. Then<br />\nwe will develop an evolutionary view of present<br />\norganisms and go on to examples of evolution<br />\nfrom the fossil record.<br />\nAt this point students should have a fair<br />\n\"classical\" perspective on evolution. From this<br />\npoint on we will attempt the \"modern\" genetic<br />\napproach to evolution--Mendel applied to populations. The result of all this will, hopefully, be<br />\na good solid general view of biology, one that<br />\nwill save people from losing their way in the<br />\ngreater details of more advanced courses.<br />\nWhile the course is intended primarily for biology and natural sciences majors, it presupposes no biology beyond high school. Hence it<br />\nmight also be taken by other students interested in general biology. However, if enrollment<br />\nbecomes very large 'students other than the majors may not be able to enroll.<br />\n<br />\nCHEMISTR Y<br />\nDepartment's Statenrnt: The aim of the Department of Chemistry is to furnish a quality chemistry background for our own majors and those<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates for whom chemistry is a cognate subject. All courses (except for<br />\nPhysical Chemistry for Non-chemistry Majors)<br />\nare designed for both majors and no-majors alike. Accordingly, although some of our chemistry courses are broad in scope, they are not<br />\ncourses designed for survey but are courses designed to provide the student with the necessary background for his future studies. Since the<br />\nlaboratory is an important aspect of chemistry,<br />\nmost of our courses have concurrent laboratories and a good deal of our efforts are devoted<br />\nto the laboratory instruction.<br />\n<br />\n3.1 INTRODUCTORY<br />\nCHEMISTRY<br />\nDrs. Gryder,<br />\nDoering & Kokes<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\n<br />\n286<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n300<br />\n104/150<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: For all the incoming freshman pre-med throats at Hopkins, Dr. Gryder's<br />\nIntroductory Chemistry is their first exposure<br />\nto a science course and provides an excellent<br />\nbackground for further chemistry courses.<br />\nBased upon the responses of this year's freshmen, Dr. Gryder is doing an excellent job in<br />\nthe teaching of Introductory Chemistry. In the<br />\nlectures Dr. Gryder used the text as a<br />\nbackgropnd to the lecture material and he attempted to answer any question asked during<br />\nlecture. The work required is about 1 chapter<br />\nper week and 10-15 problems per chapter<br />\nwhich results in a workload of about 8-12<br />\nhours per week. In the course the grades were<br />\nbased upon 4 exams and a final. If the student<br />\nwas satisfied with his grade average in the<br />\ncourse, he did not have to take the final at the<br />\nend of the year. Due to the fact that Dr.<br />\nGryder allows the students to drop one test<br />\nand the preset curve, he has attempted to alleviate some pressure new freshman feel from<br />\ncompetition for grades from fellow students.<br />\nEven with his research and activities with the<br />\npre-meds at Hopkins, Dr. Gryder still finds time<br />\nto conduct 2 1-2 hour question and answer periods a week and he is still available for<br />\nindividual students at his office. In the case\u2014fl<br />\nan extremely low average on a test, Dr. Grydl.e<br />\nadds points to get a C+ curve. Based upon the<br />\nresponses of this year's freshmen, the only fault<br />\nof the course was the conferences. The conference leaders were said to be inadequately prepared to answer problems from the homework<br />\nand at times were dealing with topics which<br />\nhad no bearing upon the text and lectures.<br />\n<br />\n(<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\n3.28 INTRODUCTORY<br />\nORGANIC CHEMISTRY<br />\nFaculty<br />\n<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n267<br />\n38<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\n327<br />\n89/ 1 60<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The course is required for<br />\nscience majors. But given this, most students<br />\nfound Dr. Posner interesting and informative.<br />\nThe grading in Dr. Posner's section was considered fair, but there was grumbling about the<br />\ndifferences between his section and Dr. Nickon's. Most students recommended the course<br />\n'by Posner, and wished he would teach the second semester. The work is \"throat determined.\"<br />\n(Note: Last year Drs. Posner and Nickon<br />\ntaught this course.)<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: In the past years at Johns<br />\nHopkins, Organic Chemistry has represented the<br />\nnemesis of the premed students. The course is<br />\nrequired by almost every medical school in the<br />\ncountry and it also happens to be one of the<br />\nhardest courses in the sciences. According to<br />\nthe responses of the students in 3.23 last semester, the course was not quite the disaster<br />\nanticipated. The switchover from the Corwin<br />\ntext to the Morrison and Boyd text which is<br />\nconcise and relatively clear, although detailed,<br />\nwas considered an improvement. Dr. Nickon<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nwas found to be a clear and informative lecturer. However, the workload is still one of the<br />\ntoughest on campus and requires about 15-20<br />\nhours of study time divided among 1-2 chapters<br />\nper week and about 15-20 problems per chapter. In the duration of the semester 3 exams<br />\nand 4 quizzes were required in addition to the<br />\nfinal. All the averages were scaled to a value of<br />\n70%. In the final compilation of the grade, Dr.<br />\nNickon failed to indicate what the curve would<br />\nbe or how well on the final a student had to<br />\ndo to get a certain grade. In the final grades<br />\nthe curve turned out to be very low and over<br />\nforty percent of the students ended up with a<br />\nC or lower. In order to cover the vast amount<br />\nof material, Dr. Nickon found it impossible to<br />\nanswer questions during the lecture and the student with problems had to go to his office or<br />\nto the grad students if he was not available. According to a consensus of students, the conferences were of poor quality and there was a<br />\ngreat discrepancy in the ability of the graduate<br />\nstudent leaders. The conferences were felt by<br />\nmost students as a place to take quizzes and<br />\nthen discuss the quiz or tests with little time<br />\nleft for problems. And for the stude<br />\n.nt with difficulty, the accessability of Dr. Nickon through<br />\nhis secretary or the graduate students was questionable. Thus, even with the change in textbooks students feel that more changes must be<br />\nmade for the majority of Hopkins premeds to<br />\nmaster the subject.<br />\n<br />\n3.301 PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY I<br />\nDr. Robinson<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduage<br />\nOther<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n5<br />\n19<br />\n38<br />\n9<br />\n7<br />\n78<br />\n25/78<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: In the past, Dr. Poland had<br />\ntaught this course for some years, and very successfully. The size of this year's Intro. Chem.<br />\ncourse evidently necessitated calling Dr. Poland<br />\nto teach a lecture se'ction there, and Dr. Robinson was called at the last minute to teach<br />\nP\u2014Chem. Unfortunately, it appeared to some<br />\nthat Dr. Robinson had had little time to prepare for this course.(He normally teaches spectroscopy.) The course was not received so well<br />\nas in previous years.<br />\nThere were many complaints about the lectures. Except for the grad students, many felt<br />\nDr. Robinson was lecturing above the heads of<br />\nthe class. Several students (about 25-30%) concluded that Dr. Robinson was not interested in<br />\nthe class. Others, however, attributed this to<br />\nthe late date at which Dr. Robinson was appointed to teach the course. Most students<br />\nfound him very interested and willing to help.<br />\nDr. Robinson was definitely not the only<br />\ncause of trouble in P\u2014Chem. One problem was<br />\nthe required texts, which were received, overall,<br />\nmore poorly than the lectures. Those who were<br />\nmore specific commented that Karplus & Porter's book was good to excellent, while Kauzmann's books were poor to \"horrible\".<br />\nOther complaints included grading, which<br />\nwas done by a Chem. grad student, and which<br />\nwas regarded as fair mostly by seniors and<br />\ngrads, and unfair by the juniors and some<br />\nothers. Wherever the prof. did grade however,<br />\nthere were no complaints. Also, most found the<br />\nB-curve to be fair. Outside work was another<br />\nsource of complaints, with many people doing<br />\nbetween 5 and 10 hours per week. Several felt<br />\nthe course should be 4 credits. Finally, several<br />\nPeople found the math above their level. Respondents- recommended Advanced Calculus as<br />\nat least a corequisite.<br />\nAll in all, this course was no great success<br />\nthis last year, for a variety of reasons. Many<br />\ndid not recommend the prof. or the course. It<br />\n<br />\nseems as things went along, they got better,<br />\nhowever, and things should be improving next<br />\nyear. A good course to take Pass/Fail, and it<br />\nmay be prudent to sign up for Math 11.10 with<br />\nit.<br />\n<br />\n3.331 CHEMICAL<br />\nCRYSTALLOGRAPHY:<br />\nDr. Kistenmacher<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The basic aims of this<br />\ncourse are to present sufficient material to the<br />\nstudents to accomplish two goals:<br />\nA working<br />\nknowledge of how X-ray diffraction is useful to<br />\nchemists, geologists, biologists, etc. The main<br />\nsubgoal here being the process of structure determination by the techniques of X-ray diffraction.<br />\nAn elucidation of the experimental and<br />\nmathematical techniques necessary for analysis<br />\nof the diffraction results. Some time will also<br />\nbe spent on the assessment of the accuracy of<br />\nthe structural results -- a point of prime interest<br />\nto the \"nonpracticing\" crystallographer.<br />\nThe course itself will be informal and loosely<br />\nstructured. A short discussion (written or oral)<br />\nwill be requested on some structure determination of interest to the student. A minimum<br />\nnumber of exams, but a more extensive array<br />\nof homework will be given -- X-ray diffraction<br />\nis a pilictical science and often best illustrated<br />\nby worked examples.<br />\n<br />\n3.325 PHYSICAL ORGANIC<br />\nDr. Murr<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is taken primarily by grad students with a sprinkling of<br />\nsenior's, and as such is a course for only the dedicated. But those who are willing to put in<br />\nsome time will find this excellent course and<br />\nDr. Murr one of the best profs in the department. The texts are expensive and not used<br />\nmuch; most of the outside time is spent reading<br />\npapers. There is no other homework. Tests are<br />\nrigorous and perhaps too long but fairly curved.<br />\nSome might find that Dr. Murr spends a<br />\ndisproportionate amount of time on topics of<br />\nhis own interest.<br />\n<br />\nCLASSICS<br />\nDepartment'sStatenent: Our main goal is to offer<br />\nan introduction to Greek and Roman civilization. We beieve that various approaches should<br />\nbe combined in order to achieve a full understanding of these ancient civilizations.<br />\nThere is the linguistic approach. Our department offers Greek and Latin courses on different levels and courses in Indoeuropean linguistics.<br />\nThere is the literary approach. The great<br />\ntexts (Homer, the Greek lyric poets, Greek drama, Herodotus, Horace, Virgil, Ovid - to mention only a few) are read and discussed either<br />\nin the original or in English translation.<br />\nThere is the historical approach. Greek and<br />\nRoman history are a fascinating panorama<br />\nwhich is surveyed and interpreted in a cycle of<br />\ncourses. The ancient historians are studied and<br />\nevaluated.<br />\nFinally, there is the archaeological approach.<br />\nArchitecture, painting and sculpture are a superb part of the heritage of Greece and Rome,<br />\nand the introductory courses in these subjects<br />\nare traditionally among the most popular classes in this University.<br />\n<br />\n4.3 LATIN AND GREEK IN<br />\nCURRENT USE<br />\nDr. Poultney<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Well Hoppie your search<br />\nhas ended; you have landed upon the course to<br />\n<br />\nPage 3<br />\ntake. A - it's a gut, B - the staff apparently is<br />\ninteresting and C - the professor cares enough<br />\nto make his teaching effective. The biggest problem with the course is that Dr. Poultney<br />\nsticks exactly to the text.<br />\n(Note: This is a reprint from the Nov. 1971<br />\nCourse Guide.)<br />\n<br />\n4.17 INTERMEDIATE GREEK<br />\nDr. Young<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Intermediate (i.e. 2nd<br />\nyear) Greek, is intended for those fairly rare<br />\nstudents (Graduate or Undergraduate) who are<br />\ndesirous of learning ancient Greek. We usually<br />\nread The Defense of Socrates (\"Plato's Apology \"), some scenes from Aristophanes' Birds,<br />\nand quite a lot of the Iliad. We also often read<br />\nsamples of other poetry, both lyric and elegiac.<br />\n<br />\n4.303 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nCLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY<br />\nDr. Young<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a once-overlightly discussion (with illustrations) of the antiquities of the Greeks and the Romans, as well<br />\nas their predecessors, such as Minoan and<br />\nMycenaeans, and Etruscans. We consider their<br />\narchitecture, sculpture, pottery, painting and<br />\nminor arts. This course is designed to interest<br />\nthose who are curious about classical antiquity,<br />\nits history, its art, and its people and their habits.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The lectures were considered informal and interesting, and Dr. Young's<br />\nsense of humor was considered quite an asset<br />\nto the course. There was only one final examination and it was evaluated as quite fair. Only<br />\nclass time is required in this course.<br />\n(Note: This is a reprint from the Nov. 1971<br />\n(ourcP Guitip<br />\n<br />\n4.321 HISTORY OF<br />\nCLASSICAL GREECE<br />\n1)r. Bradley<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course covers<br />\nGreek history from the Bronze Age until the<br />\nPeloponnesian War. Emphasis will be placed on<br />\npolitical and constitutional developments. There<br />\nwill be two lectures a week (MT 2:00 PM),<br />\nwith an additional preceptorial (TBA) in which<br />\nreading assignments and lecture material can be<br />\ndiscussed. Readings will be assigned from Herodotus and Thucydides (in English) as well as<br />\nsecondary sources. Some written work will be<br />\nrequired.

Undergraduate courses recommended<br />\nfor majors are accessible to physical science students in the University.<br />\nFor students who are not majoring in the<br />\nphysical sciences, the Department offers a series<br />\nof one-semester courses in astronomy, the solid<br />\nearth, meteorology and oceanography. The general aim of these courses is to interest such students in some of the variety of phenomena encountered in the earth sciences, to give them an<br />\nappreciation of the kinds of questions involved<br />\nin scientific investigation, the reasons why scientists regard these questions as important and<br />\nthe ways of investigation used. The courses demand little or no previous technical background. Any number of them can be taken in<br />\nany order.<br />\nDr. Scott's course, the Astronomy of the<br />\nSolar System, is offered for non-majors each semester. A new course for non-majors,The Planet Earth, will be offered for the first time by<br />\nDr. Phillips in the Fall Semester, 1973.<br />\n<br />\n27.15 ASTRONOMY OF THE<br />\nSOLAR SYSTEM<br />\nDr. Scott<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n61/87<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is popular<br />\namong pre-meds and humanities students alike-in short with anyone who needs a few easy N<br />\ncredits. Student grades consist of daily quizzes<br />\n(1/3), 2 mid-terms (1/3), and a. final (1/3), all<br />\ngraded on an 80-87 B, 88-100A, etc. curve.with<br />\nopen notes and questions straight from them.<br />\nThe daily quizzes do make class attendance<br />\nmandatory, but that's the only time you need<br />\nspend on the course, since the text is supplemental. Students find Dr. Scott an interesting<br />\nlecturer but one who perhaps underestimates<br />\nthe intellectual capabilities of his students. Students also found him occasionally misinformed<br />\non some recent development in the field that<br />\nhe hasn't kept up with. This course is scheduled at a time suitable for just about anyone and<br />\nshould be considered by any student who doesn't mind a lack of intellectual stimulation for<br />\nhis money.<br />\n<br />\n27.17 THE ATMOSPHERE AND<br />\nOCEANS<br />\nDr. Benton<br />\nResponse Ratio<br />\n<br />\n21/72<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Benton is a fine lecturer--clearly the best part of the course. Students unanimously praised his ability to clearly<br />\nanswer questions and clarify points. Unfortunately Dr. Benton's other responsibilities make<br />\nhim unavailable outside of class and periodically necessary for a substitute to take over. The<br />\ngrade consists of two mid-terms and a final<br />\ngraded by grad students on a B curve. This is a<br />\nvery general course that should not be taken by<br />\nscience majors interested in approaching the<br />\nsubject in depth but should be considered by<br />\nothers looking for a straightforward, elementary<br />\ncourse with 3 N credits.<br />\n<br />\n27.301 CLASSICAL<br />\nMAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS<br />\nDr. Scott<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The only review available<br />\nfor this course consists of material taken from<br />\nDr. Scott's course, Astronomy of the Solar<br />\n<br />\nSystem, listed above. Dr. Scott appears to be<br />\nlimited in knowledge of material beyond his<br />\nfields of specialization, which will make a<br />\ncourse of his undersirable for those demanding<br />\ncomprehensive coverage of subject material and<br />\napplications. He does try hard and his grading<br />\npolicy is not rigorous.<br />\n<br />\nEDUCATION<br />\n<br />\n5.313 INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />\nSTUDY OF EDUCATION<br />\nDr. Walton<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course serves as an<br />\nintroductory course to the study of education.<br />\nAlthough it includes a consideration of the interdisciplinary study of the subject, stress is<br />\nplaced on the integrity and autonomy of the<br />\npedagogical context. Students should be prepared to make an effort to get at the essential<br />\nnature of formal education, its inevitabilities<br />\nand ossibilities, rather than to take an evasive<br />\nintellectual route that by-passes the school.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Walton is this course.<br />\nThe requirements for the semester are one<br />\nbook, Dr. Walton's, and one \"substantial\" paper, so you can do whatever you wish. But the<br />\nlectures, 2 per week, are collages of ideas and<br />\ndiscussion on just about anything. Dr. Walton<br />\nreally knows what he is talking about. The<br />\n\"sage\" can create a strong argument on the<br />\nspur of the moment and then lead a discussion<br />\nthat is informative and thought provoking--a<br />\nrarity. Even if you are not planning to go into<br />\neducation, this course is a good one to take, even if for no other reason than being able to say<br />\nthat you had a Walton course. The grading on<br />\nthe paper was fair with an apparent B curve;<br />\nbut it seems that in this course, the grade doesn't seem to matter. The experience does.<br />\n(This is a reprint from the Nov. 19 71 Course<br />\nGuide.)<br />\n<br />\nADMINISTRATION IN<br />\n'Ailf,RICAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<br />\nDr. Walton<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course will have to<br />\nbe limited to ten juniors and seniors. It will involve assignments in the schools as well as seminar discussions and reports.<br />\n<br />\nELECTRICAL<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\nDepartment Statement: The name \"Electrical<br />\nEngineering\" does not adequately convey the<br />\ngenerality and scope of the content of the<br />\nmany introductory courses offered by the department. Although these beginning courses lay<br />\nthe foundation for more advanced work within<br />\nthe programs within electrical engineering, they<br />\nare of sufficient generality to be of interest and<br />\nvalue to students in many other disciplines as<br />\nwell. For instance, the new course on Models<br />\nand Simulation, introduced this year, has not<br />\nyet dealt with an electrical system -- yet many<br />\nof the fundamental notions involved in studying systems of all kinds have been studied. The<br />\nrevolution in experimental methodology and<br />\nmeasurement being brought about by modern<br />\nintegrated circuits (which now offer a complete<br />\ndigital computer on a tiny chip of silicon at little cost) requires that these techniques be common knowledge to anyone working in science<br />\nor engineering.<br />\nWith the help of a $100,000 grant by the<br />\nWestinghouse Educational Foundation specifically for development of its undergraduate program, the Electrical Engineering Department is<br />\nexpanding its offerings of introductory courses<br />\nof interest to students in other departments.<br />\nThe Westinghouse grant (the first of its kind<br />\nmade by that corporation) will provide facilities<br />\nand laboratory resources needed to study the<br />\nlatest techniques for measuring and sensing data, such as that needed for environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the grant will provide for<br />\nexpansion of the department's PDP-11&45<br />\ncomputer system to 12 time-shared terminals<br />\n<br />\nSpring 1973<br />\nby August 1973. Six of these terminals are<br />\nplanned for instructional use in connection<br />\nwith many of the courses offered by the department described below.<br />\n<br />\n52.17 MODELS AND<br />\nSIMULATION<br />\nDr. Huggins<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n16<br />\n18<br />\n13<br />\n12<br />\n2<br />\n51<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course emphasizes<br />\nthe formulation and representation of system<br />\nmodels using ideas that are generally applicable<br />\nto many disciplines today. A major them is<br />\nthat \"simulation is thinking made public.\" This<br />\ntechnique offers important opportunities for<br />\ngiving concise public expression to the consequences of our quantitative knowledge about<br />\nbiological, economic, environmental, and engineering systems.<br />\nThe course ties'Keller's Personalized Instructional Metlidd with e'mphasis on self-paced study by each student, with individual assistance<br />\nfrom tutors and instructors, rather than on formal leciures' as 'the'.

The number of units completed<br />\nlargely determines the grade in the course.<br />\nThe course may be taken by freshmen who<br />\nare familiar with algebra although some familiarity with the calculus will be helpful.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Models and Simulation is<br />\ngiven in self teaching units,' with a student who<br />\ntook the course before 8s'a proctor. The professor gives only a few lectures. There was a<br />\ntest for each unit completed -- about 9 or 10<br />\nfor the semester comprising 75% of the grade.<br />\nThe final exam covered the other 25%. Reactions by the fifty or so taking the course to this<br />\nsystem went from \"gear to very poor and<br />\n\"worthless.\" Most considered the grading fair,<br />\nbut thought that a little too much work had to<br />\nbe put into the course. Most also thought the<br />\ncourse to be a little too theoretical and not<br />\npractical enough, especially the E.E. majors because electronics is almost avoided. Most students on the whole considerodit a' good course<br />\nbut felt a 'background in catculus and some in<br />\nelectricityis,needed before,taking it.<br />\n<br />\n52.49 INttGATED CIRCUITS<br />\nAND.

The course is<br />\ngraded entirely upon the lab reports, and grading is extremely fair and generous. The texts<br />\nfor the course are fairly good, and Dr. Westgate's lectures cover all the material that you<br />\nneed to know. The amount of work required<br />\nwas termed just right.

In short, we<br />\nwill use mathematics to study in greater depth<br />\nthe kinds of models that are treated in EE<br />\n17-18, Models and Simulation. We will also use<br />\nthe PDP-11 computer, but more as an aid to<br />\nanalytical approaches than as a simulation tool.<br />\nPrerequisites are 2.17-18, 11.10-11, and<br />\n52.33-34 or further mathematical maturity.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Students were not ecstatic<br />\nwith this course, but all were satisfied with it.<br />\nThere was no text for this course, though several books on control and systems theory were<br />\non reserve in Hutzler and page references were<br />\ngiven in the lectures for those who needed<br />\nthem. The grade was based on the best 3 of<br />\nfour hourlies and marginally on the weekly<br />\nhomework problems. Dr. Rugh was a reasonable lecturer, few had difficulty following his<br />\npresentations and he handled questions well.<br />\nThe material had little immediate practical application, but considering its introductory nature, this was not a subject for complaint. This<br />\ncourse is recommended to E.E. majors and<br />\nothers interested in systems theory.<br />\n<br />\nENGLISH<br />\n6.51 SHAKESPEARE:<br />\nCOMEDIES AND ROMANCES<br />\nDr. Stein<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course, 6.51, will<br />\ncenter as much as possible on the plays<br />\nthemselves and try to consider such matters as<br />\nthe particular distinctness of each play as work<br />\nof art, as comment of human experience, the<br />\nrelationship with other plays of Shakespeare's,<br />\nwith concepts of comedy (old and new), with<br />\nRenaissance thought, with modem thought.<br />\nThe whole class will meet for two lecturediscussions a week and divide into small groups<br />\nfor a third meeting.<br />\n<br />\n6.301 CHAUCER: SONGS,<br />\nDREAM\u2014VISIONS,TROILUS &<br />\nDr. Howard<br />\nCRISEDE<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a two-semester<br />\ncourse covering all the major works of Geoffrey<br />\nChaucer. The works will be assigned in the order in which Chaucer wrote them and will be<br />\nread in Middle English. The text is A. C.<br />\nBaugh, Chaucer's Major Poetry. The course will<br />\ntry to teach the student to read Chaucer's English, interpret his poems against the background of his age, and understand why he is<br />\none of the greatest writers of all time.<br />\nThe course will be taught by some combination of lectures, readings from the text, and<br />\ndiscussion. There will be at least one paper,<br />\nsome quizzes, probably an exam,--these depending on the size and character of the class. Some<br />\ncollateral readings will be recommended, a reserve shelf will be set up in the library, tapes of<br />\nMiddle English will be available ir..the language<br />\n<br />\nlaboratory, and some slides of contemporary<br />\nmanuscript drawings will be shown.<br />\nThe first semester will treat some of the<br />\nshorter poems, The Book of the Duchess, The<br />\nHouse of Fame, The Parliament of Fowles, and<br />\nTroilus and Criseyde.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Professor Howard is regarded as \"excellent\" by an overwhelming proportion of his students. Lectures are interesting,<br />\n\"worthwhile\", and -stimulating, and discussion<br />\nusually results. However, his courses are not<br />\neasy: the work is considerable, and exams are<br />\nfair but rigorous.<br />\n<br />\n. 6.303 ELEMENTARY ANGLO<br />\nSAXON<br />\nDr. Irwin<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Irwin is generally rated as<br />\ngood by most of his students. He is extremely<br />\nknowledgible, interesting, and interested, as<br />\nwell, always willing to talk with students. His<br />\nlectures are regarded favorably, except for his<br />\nfrequent digressions from the topic.<br />\n<br />\nGEOGRAPHY<br />\nAND<br />\nENVIRONMENTAL<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\nDepartment Statement: Students and faculty in<br />\nthe Dept. of Geography and Environmental Engineering are interested in how nature works,<br />\nhow society works, and the ways in which .engineering can help to match the desires of society with the workings of the natural world.<br />\nBecause engineering design and public decision<br />\nmaking must rest upon a sound knowledge of<br />\nhow things work, study of the environment involves both the sciences and the arts. Because<br />\nthe department is concerned with the interrelationship between the natural and social sciences<br />\nand engineering, students from many fields are<br />\nencouraged to enroll in the courses offered. A<br />\nnew course will be offered under the auspices<br />\nof this department by members of the Dept. of<br />\nEpidemiology of the School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health. This course is entitled<br />\n\"Environmental determanants of Human Diseas.\" It will be at the 300 level and should be<br />\nof interest to many students ranging from premeds to social scientists.<br />\n<br />\n38.2 MAN AND ENVIRONMENT<br />\nDr. Wolman<br />\n<br />\nClass Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n7<br />\n12<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n36<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course has no text,<br />\nbut required outside readings that were generally well accepted. Dr. Wolman's lectures enlarged on the material in these readings, the exams covering both lectures and readings with an<br />\nemphasis on the lecture material. There was<br />\none hourly, a final, one term paper, and two<br />\nfive page papers. Not requiring an unreasonable<br />\namount of work for the credit, this course is<br />\nrecommended to anyone interested in the environment.<br />\n<br />\n38.11 HOUSING IN BALTIMORE<br />\nDr. Harvey<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Harvey has been quite<br />\nwell received by students who have taken his<br />\ncourses. Comments included occasions that Dr.<br />\nHarvey \"made\" the course and that his teaching a course was sufficient reason to take it.<br />\nApparently Dr. Harvey tends toward philosophical discussions, long recommended reading<br />\nlists and is rated as very accessible.<br />\n(This is a reprint from the Nov. 1971 Course<br />\nGuide.)<br />\n<br />\n38.329 CHEMISTRY AND<br />\nPHYSICS OF WATER<br />\nDr. Gavis<br />\nPOLLUTION<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Gavis, while meticulously organized, has been criticized in the past<br />\nfor assuming too much previous knowledge on<br />\nthe part of the students and speaking a little<br />\ntoo quickly in his lectures. He has, however,<br />\nbeen considered fair and accessible.<br />\n(This review is written from material on another course taught by Dr. Gavis.)<br />\n<br />\n38.385 READING MARX'S<br />\nCAPITAL<br />\nDr. Harvey<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Marx's Capital is a difficult and intimidating work to tackle on your<br />\nown. I want to set up a course that will help<br />\nthose who are interested or curious about its<br />\ncontent and meaning, to find a way through it<br />\nthat overcomes some of the difficulties. I will<br />\nnot pretend that the work will be easy for a<br />\ndeep and challenging work cannot be interpreted simply or glibly. So the aim of the course<br />\nis to help you to read it. We will not read all<br />\nof it. I aim to select a way through Volume 1<br />\n(concentrating on certain key sections) to skim<br />\nVolume II, and to return to a more detailed examination of the content of the first half of<br />\nVolume III. My role as a teacher is to act as a<br />\nguide. Your role as student i to explore. There<br />\nwill be no tests or examinations. But I do expect the reading to be done and I also expedt<br />\npeople to attend the class sessions. There will<br />\nbe one two hour session at which attendance is<br />\nexpected and a one hour session which will be<br />\nopen to use (or non-use) as we see fit as a class<br />\n(to consolidate ideas, to explore implications,<br />\nor to clear up particularly contentious points).<br />\nI would emphasize that the aim of the course is<br />\nto discover what it is that Marx has to say.<br />\nMany people think they know what Marx has<br />\nto say (without ever having read him). If you<br />\nread Capital you may be surprised.<br />\n<br />\n,411<br />\n<br />\n\fPage 6<br />\n<br />\nSpring 1973<br />\n<br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\n<br />\nGERMAN<br />\n9.1 ELEMENTARY GERMAN<br />\nDr. Friesen and Staff<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n82<br />\n19<br />\n12<br />\n5<br />\n2<br />\n121<br />\n63/1 21<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course covers the<br />\nbasic principles of German pronunciation, grammar and syntax. The thorough study of the<br />\ncompact German for Beginners is coupled early<br />\nin the first semester with graded readings from<br />\nVorboten der Gegenwart (about Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Einstein) and Die Deutschen und<br />\ndie Osterreicher (about 20th-century German<br />\nhistory.) The cultural contest of these books is<br />\nsupplemented in the second semester with literary selections by modern authors from Literature fur den Deutschunterricht II as well as mimeographed material.<br />\nAs far as the scheduled readings permit, a<br />\nminimum of oral (class work is devoted to<br />\npronunciation practice and grammatical patterns. In order to earn the extra half credit allotted students are expected to attend the Language Laboratory regularly(/<br />\n1<br />\n2 hour per week).<br />\nThis year the course has an enrollment of over<br />\n120 students and is taught by six instructors<br />\nand myself, under my coordination. A common<br />\nsyllabus ensures uniformity in instruction,<br />\nassignments, and grading. The semester grade is<br />\na composite of achievements in class work,<br />\nquizzes, hourly examinations, and homework.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: For those Hopkins throats<br />\nwith an aversion to sleeping later than 7:00<br />\nA.M., Dr. Friesan's Elementary German appears<br />\nto be an excellent introductory course to German which upper division students could enjoy<br />\nin addition to freshman. The 31<br />\n/<br />\n2 credits of the<br />\ncourse cover 3 1 hour lecture periods plus a<br />\nminimum of one half hour that each student is<br />\nexpected to spend in the infamous language lab<br />\neach week. For the grade, the student is evaluated by 3 one hour exams, quizzes, homework,<br />\nand classwork. Due to a pre-set grade scale of<br />\nDr. Friesan, competition is kept at a minimum,<br />\nand past students felt that with a reasonable<br />\namount of work (about 5-10 hours per week)<br />\none should get at least a B if not an A. In additi.on, most students were very praiseworthy of<br />\nDr. Friesan and stated he was knowledgeable<br />\nand readily answered questions. The class time<br />\nwas primarily used to discuss grammar and to<br />\ntranslate difficult protions in the reading. However, the major emphasis is upon reading German and almost all discussion in class is in \"English.\" Perhaps, Dr. Friesan will attempt to integrate more German conversation into 9.1, if<br />\nnot, one will have to take German Conversation<br />\n9.5 in addition to the Elementary German 9.1.<br />\n<br />\n9.3 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN<br />\nDr. Allen and Staff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The basic second-year<br />\nGerman course intended to develop skills in<br />\nreading and comprehension. The first semester<br />\nincludes a thorough review of grammar with interspersed reading assignments of increasing difficulty. The second semester will continue the<br />\nreadings (using texts from the areas of modern<br />\nfiction and drama.) Some \"sight reading\" practice will be done also with newspaper articles<br />\nand other texts of interest to the students of a<br />\ngiven section. Grades are determined on the basis of shorter quizzes, longer departmental<br />\nhourlies, written assignments, Class work (pre, ,<br />\n<br />\nparation, response, participation), and a final.<br />\nNo laboratory work is required for the course,<br />\nalthough a student may, at his or her option,<br />\nelect to do lab work for an extra /<br />\n1<br />\n2 hour of<br />\ncredit. Some oral German will be used in class<br />\nby the instructors. For information see Richard<br />\nAllen, 244 Gilman Hall.<br />\n<br />\n9.5 ELEMENTARY GERMAN<br />\nCONVERSATION<br />\nDr. Friesen and Staff<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n6<br />\n2<br />\n2<br />\n0<br />\n13<br />\n5/1 3<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: As a logical supplement<br />\nof the more reading-oriented German Elements,<br />\nthis course gives interested students an opportunity to learn and apply some of the more frequent patterns used in daily spoken German.<br />\nThe book, Conversational German One, is meant<br />\nto be a point of departure rather than a repository of everything covered in this course. Students are encouraged to indicate to their instructors specific linguistic difficulties and topics they would like to discuss in German. Although the greatest emphasis is placed on oral<br />\nclass participation!, there is a modicum of short<br />\nwritten homework assignments.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: In the language departments at Hopkins the major orientation of the<br />\ncourses is toward the reading of the language<br />\nand an exploration of the native literature. For<br />\nlanguage majors or students entering technical<br />\nfields, this could prove to be quite useful. But<br />\na large number of students do not: need such<br />\nan extensive background in reading skills and<br />\nwould prefer to concentrate on conversation<br />\nperhaps to be used on a future student trip to<br />\nEurope. For this type of student, German Conversation, which was taught by Barbara Paul last<br />\nsemester, is the answer. The course requires 2<br />\n1-hour classes per wek and students averaged<br />\n3-7 hours per week of outside study. The<br />\ncourse was small and informal with 5 students<br />\nin it last semester. The major emphasis is German conversation with grammar and literature<br />\nintegrated into the course where useful. There<br />\nwas a total lack of Hopkins grade pressure associated with the course and the grade was almost entirely based upon oral presentation. Tte<br />\nstudents were effusive in their praise of Barbara<br />\nPaul in regard to the quality of her teaching.<br />\nShe readily fielded questions in class and was<br />\navailable for outside consultation. Dr. Friesan<br />\ncould take some lessons on how to improve his<br />\nelementary German course from this course by<br />\nintroducing conversation on that level in conjunction with the literature, rather than forcing<br />\nstudents to take an additional course in his department to pick up the conversation.<br />\n<br />\n9.7 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN<br />\nCONVERSATION AND COMPOSITION<br />\nDr. Allen and Staff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course is intended<br />\nto develop skills in speaking and writing German at a level considerably beyond just routine<br />\ncommunication. Oral activities will include<br />\ntalks, discussions, debates, linguistic \"games\"<br />\nrole-playing, situation dramas, etc. The written<br />\nassignments will include dialogues, letters, essays, translations, poetry, simple fiction, etc.<br />\nFollowing a brief grammatical review at the beginning of the first semester, the course will unfold organizationally concentrating on correcting<br />\nthose deficiencies in pronunciation, style, and<br />\nvocabulary that show up in the performance of<br />\nthe students. The instructions will strive to<br />\nmaintain an informal atmosphere in which creative. participation can flourish. Except for vo,<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\ncabulary and stylistic reference works, no text<br />\nbooks will be used. Weekly laboratory work is<br />\nrequired (for an extra /<br />\n1<br />\n2 hour credit). Grades<br />\nare based on progress in pronunciation and fluency, quizzes, exams, and written assignments.<br />\nPrerequisite: German 1-2 or the equivalent plus<br />\nsome experience in oral work.

Artistic aspects, e.g., structure, style, and narrative techniques, as well as<br />\ntopics and themes, will be discussed.<br />\nStories by Kafka, Hesse, Mann, Brecht, and<br />\nBoll will be read. Kafka's Verwandlung will be<br />\nincluded during the first semester and Gunter<br />\nGrass' Katz und Maus will be read during the<br />\nsecond semester. Students may consult the<br />\ntranslations of the two larger works.<br />\nThree hourly examinations will be given during each semester.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: For the student with one<br />\nyear of college level German or 2 years of high<br />\nschool German, Modern German Short Fiction<br />\nrepresents an excellent course for continuing in<br />\nthe German language. The course used<br />\nMeisterzahugen, an anthology of German short<br />\nstories of varying difficulty. Three hourly exams are given over the course of the semester<br />\nand a final is added. There is no competition<br />\nfor grades since a set scale has been established<br />\nof 91-100% A, 81-90% B, etc. According to the<br />\nstudents, an average of 10-15 hours was spent<br />\noutside class reading and translating German<br />\nshort stories. The class time was spent on in<br />\ndepth discussions including some work on vocabulary encountered in the text. The students<br />\nfelt Karen Kapp was an excellent instructor in<br />\nthat she was well versed in the literature and<br />\nreadily available to answer questions. However,<br />\nthe major criticism of some courses in the German department appears again. The students<br />\nfelt it pointless to read and translate the text in<br />\norder to come to class and carry on discussions<br />\nin English rather than in German. It is probably<br />\ntime for Dr. Friesan to modify his courses and<br />\nintroduce German conversation into all language courses in his department.<br />\n<br />\n\fPage 7<br />\n<br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\n<br />\n9.13 SCIENTIFIC GERMAN II<br />\nDr. Homan<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Primarily a reading<br />\ncourse, Scientific German II is designed to familiarized the participants with the characteristic<br />\nsyntactical difficulties and peculiarities as well<br />\nas the terminology of German scientific texts.<br />\nThe reading material consists of original German contributions to the fields of Mathematics,<br />\nPhysics, Chemistry, Radiology, and Biology<br />\nfrom the 17th through the 20th centuries, written by such noted scholars as Leonard Euler,<br />\nGregor Mendel, Robert Koch, Wilhelm Rontgen, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and<br />\nothers.<br />\nGrades will depend on class participation and<br />\nperformance in two hourly exams and a number of quizzes.<br />\n<br />\n9.17 ADVANCED GERMAN<br />\nCONVERSATION AND<br />\nDr. Friesen<br />\nCOMPOSITION<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n6<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n15<br />\n11/15<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: A study of some of the<br />\nsubtler but crucial principles of German grammar, idiomatic pharaseology, word formation,<br />\nand stylistic levels of writing.

The<br />\nKleines Aufsatzbuch by Lederer and Neuse<br />\nserves as a point of departure for classroom discussions regarding the characteristic details of<br />\npast and present life in Germany.<br />\nStudent Evaluaion: Students of German with a<br />\nknowledge above the intermediate level generally found this course extremely worthwhile.<br />\nLauding Dr. Friesen as a \"capable,\" \"enthusiastic,\" \"talented,\" and \"sincerely interested\".professor, most felt the course was well organized.<br />\nSeveral students, however, felt there was too<br />\nmuch emphasis on composition and grammar,<br />\nrather than on conversation. Similarly, although<br />\nthe readings were generally well-regarded, a few<br />\nexpressed the feeling that they were difficult<br />\nand demanding of a great deal of time. These<br />\nsame students tended to feel the course should<br />\nbe three rather than two credits. The amount<br />\nof time needed varied according to past experience with the language. The average time required was three hours a week. Grading was<br />\njudged very fair with a bit of apprehension by<br />\nsome, because they had no real idea of what<br />\ntheir semester grade would be as it was<br />\nessentially determined by class participation<br />\nand an oral final exam. For those with a background of German above the intermediate level<br />\nand a desire to sharpen the language skills, the<br />\ncourse is well-recommended especially under<br />\nthe fine instruction of Dr. Friesen.<br />\n<br />\n9.355 GERMAN LITERATURE<br />\nIN THE AGE OF GOETHE<br />\nDr. McClain<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course has no formal prerequisites. It is designed for the student<br />\nwho wishes to become acquainted with some of<br />\nthe major works written during Goethe's lifetime, that is, between 1750 and 1830. This period comprehends the movements known as<br />\n\"Storm and Stress,\" \"Classicism\" and \"Romanticism.\" The works are read in English, but if<br />\nsufficient students wish it, an additional section<br />\nfor extra credit will be formed in which some<br />\nshorter works will be read in German. The<br />\ncourse meets twice weekly. Lectures outline<br />\nmajor lines of development, but the emphasis is<br />\non close reading of texts, which are,discussed<br />\nby the group as a whole. The hour examination<br />\n<br />\nand final examination consist of questions of a<br />\nliterary-historical nature. There is a substantial<br />\namount of reading, but it is or moderate difficulty. The course should be valuable to students majoring in comparative literature, international relations, history or the history of art.<br />\nBecause of the close connections between England and Germany at that time it should also<br />\nbe of interest to concentrators in English. Enrollment is limited to 35.<br />\n<br />\n10.9 HISTORY OF UNITED<br />\nDr. Walters<br />\nSTATES<br />\n<br />\nCourse bistribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n9.375 MODERN GERMAN<br />\nDRAMA<br />\nDr. Allen<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Study of a select number of plays from Lenz (late 18th century) to<br />\nBrecht, supplemented by critical writings of<br />\nhigh literary caliber. Emphasis on close textual<br />\nanalysis, interpretive problems, and historical<br />\nperspective. Texts in German. Required<br />\nindependent outside readings in English if the<br />\nstudent so desires. Lectures and discussions in<br />\nEnglish. Prerequisite German 3-4 or 11-12 (or<br />\nthe equivalent). Grades will be based on two<br />\n\"thought\" papers or (at the student's option)<br />\non one thought paper and a written final examination.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: 10.9, the first half of a<br />\nfull-year survey course in American history,<br />\nprovides a good background in the subject for<br />\nthose incidentally interested in it and an equally valuable launching point for students planning to delve further into the field. Dr. Walters<br />\nwas commended almost unanimously for his<br />\nstimulating lectures and willingness to answer<br />\nquestions. Conference sections elicited the usual<br />\ninvective-, charges of irrelevance, bad co-ordination with lectures, arbitrary grading, failure of<br />\ngrad students to comment on graded papers what one comes to take for granted in introductory survey courses at Hopkins. The work<br />\nload consisted of about 150 pages a week and<br />\nten pages of written work throughout the term;<br />\nnothing immoderate there. In all, it's worth going through the Micky Mouse of the conference<br />\nsections to take Dr. Walters' course. The dues<br />\nto be paid for enlightenment are lighter here<br />\nthan in most academic offerings on campus.<br />\n<br />\nHIS<br />\nDepartment Statement: In the past year the<br />\nDepartment of History has introduced a number of new types of courses for the benefit of<br />\nHopkins' students generally as well as for departmental majors. The Pro-seminars are designed to provide opportunities for studies in<br />\ndepth in particular topics, while the \"Basic<br />\nConditions of Life in Historical Perspective\"<br />\ntakes a more sweeping approach to selected<br />\ntopics of European social history. Non-majors<br />\nare encouraged to enroll in the Pro-seminars,<br />\nthough prior consultation with the professor is<br />\nstrongly advised. New introductory courses in<br />\nthe histories of Latin American and Africa have<br />\nalso been added to the offerings which are especially designed for freshmen and sophomores.<br />\nOn the advanced level (300 courses) innovation<br />\nis a normal dimension of \"Colloquium\" courses,<br />\nso students are well advised to learn about the<br />\ncontents of these courses before enrolling.<br />\n<br />\n10.14 HISTORY OF LATIN<br />\nAMERICA<br />\nDr. Russell\u2014Wood<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n10.3 HISTORY OF OCCIDENTAL \"<br />\nCIVILIZATION 1650 TO PRESENT<br />\nDr. Forster<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This survey course emphasizes the social history from 1650-1848. The<br />\nperiods approached through major issues of<br />\nthe time rather than through chronological development. This created some problems for certain students because the emphasis of the<br />\ncourse was not on historical events and a limited knowledge of historical facts of the period<br />\nwas assumed.<br />\nWork load was moderately heavy (average<br />\nabout 5 hours a week). Requirements were<br />\nreading about a book a week, three 5 page papers and a final. While some of the individual<br />\nreading selections were criticized, on the whole<br />\nthey were considered good and worthwhile.<br />\nDr. Forster was probably the best aspect of<br />\nthe course. He is definitely knowledgeable and<br />\nvery interested in teaching. Comments such as<br />\n\"enthusiastic\" and \"excellent\" were recurrent.<br />\nThe lectures were generally interesting and<br />\nwell-presented. Students found the outline on<br />\nthe board a great help. There was some<br />\ncriticism that Dr. Forster rarely completed this<br />\noutline. The result was rushing to complete the<br />\nlecture at the end of the hour and lectures frequently ran overtime.<br />\nGrading varied with each converence leader<br />\nbut was generally considered fair. Conferences<br />\non the whole were thought to be helpful.<br />\nOverall, this course was considered very good<br />\nand worth the work. It was highly recommended, especially for those interested in\u2022French history wich is Dr. Forster's field.<br />\n<br />\n28<br />\n29<br />\n20<br />\n13<br />\n90<br />\n5/90<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n1<br />\n14<br />\n5/14<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statment: The objective of the<br />\ncourse is to create in the students an awareness<br />\nof contributions in the cultural , social and<br />\neconomic areas made by the peoples south of<br />\nthe Rio Grande in the Pre-Columbian, Spanish,<br />\nand Portuguese colonial periods. Students will<br />\nbe encouraged to replace the traditional Eurocentric approach to history by a Latin American perspective. Comparisons will be drawn to<br />\nNoith American, African and Asiatic situations<br />\nwhere appropriate and to present-day cultural<br />\nand social circumstances in these areas.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: While labeled an introductory course, 10.14 requires students to do considerable reading and sophisticated essaywriting. Covering an area unfamiliar to most<br />\nHopkins students in a lively, erudite, humorous<br />\nmanner, Dr. Russell \u2014Wood has won the reputation of \"quite a character\" and his course is<br />\nconsidered a novel experience. Writing six essays involving research skills not usually mastered by novices beforehand is a task rather intimidating to under-classmen and this \"introductory course,\" in practice attracts the 300level crowd. Even so, A's are a scarce commodity here, so taking this course on a pass/fail basis would be advisable. Venturesome underclassmen and non-history majors will be rewarded<br />\nby experiencing a subject and professor anything but run-of-the-mill. Enthusiastically recommended.<br />\n<br />\n10.17 AFRICA: AN<br />\nINTRODUCTION TO ITS PEOPLES<br />\n& HISTORY<br />\nDr. Cohen<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\n<br />\n\fPage 8<br />\n<br />\nSpring 1973<br />\n<br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\n<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n7<br />\n5<br />\n24<br />\n6/24<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: A cross-disciplinary introduction to African history and culture, 10.17<br />\nwas generally well-received by its students. Dr.<br />\nCohen's lectures were described as interesting<br />\nand full of concepts and approaches unfamiliar<br />\nto those previously encountered by most Hopkins students. He was approachable and<br />\nreceptive to students' ideas. Grading was based<br />\non two open-book take-home exams. Two lectures a week; no conference sections. Required<br />\nreading was fairly heavy.<br />\n<br />\n10.95 UNDERGRADUATE<br />\nSEMINAR IN HISTORY<br />\nDr. Spring<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course is open only<br />\nto undergraduate majors in history. During the<br />\nfirst term students will be introduced to elementary aspects of writing history (including<br />\ndoing research) and thinking about its nature as<br />\nan intellectual discipline. Emphasis will be put<br />\non reading selected works and discussing and<br />\nwriting papers about them. There will be no examination. Some important books - which<br />\nmight be usefully read this summer - are the<br />\nfollowing: E. H. Carr, What is History; G. R.<br />\nElton, The Practice of History; and J. H.<br />\nPlumb, The Death of the Past.<br />\nIn the second semester students will do - under the guidance of a faculty member of their<br />\nown selection - a piece of research and writing.<br />\nIts purpose will be to continue and deepen<br />\ntheir training in historical thinking and composition.<br />\n<br />\nHIS<br />\nOF<br />\nART<br />\n1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />\nHISTORY OF ART Dr. Stanton<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was last given<br />\nin the fall of 1971. At that time 84 of the 109<br />\nstudents responding ranked the course as excellent. Eighteen thought it was only \"very good:\"<br />\nSo this goes on our \"recommended for those<br />\nwho want to try something else\" list. Note one<br />\ncomplaint of most people \u2014 that there were<br />\ntoo many people. What you can expect if you<br />\ntake the course are interesting, information \u2014<br />\npacked lectures, highlighted by slides, with possibly some difficulty in taking complete notes<br />\n(the only other major complaint: Dr. Stanton<br />\ntries to present too much material in her lectures.) The course grade is curved (B curve),<br />\nbased around two exams and a short paper on<br />\nthe aesthetics of some work of art - which<br />\nmost people thought a nice touch. All in all,<br />\none of the best coursesat Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nHIS<br />\nOF<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of the<br />\nHistory of Science is introducing in the academic year 1973-74 a new program leading to the<br />\nB.A. degree with a major in Science and History. The object of this program will be to provide undergraduates with training both in the<br />\nsciences and history, thus enabling them to understand and to deal with the conceptual and<br />\ninstitutional nature of modern science and medicine. It is not the aim of the program solely to<br />\nproduce either literate scientists or scientifically<br />\ninformed humanists, although these might be<br />\nconsidered laudable aims, but rather to equip<br />\nstudents, whatever their ultimate professional<br />\ngoals, to comprehend the conceptual, technological, and social constraints which science<br />\nplaces upon modern society. In this light the<br />\nprogram will have appeal to students bound for<br />\none of the professions such as law, medicine,<br />\nteaching, and business, who in their careers will<br />\nbe forced to confrOnt aspects of the impact of<br />\nscience on modern society, or to deal with the<br />\ncultural decisions shaping the growth of science<br />\nitself.<br />\n<br />\nHUMANITIES<br />\n30.13 MAN AND HIS FICTIONS:<br />\nFORMS OF THE NARRATIVE<br />\nIN WESTERN LITERATURE<br />\nDr. Macksey<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n6<br />\n16<br />\n11<br />\n36<br />\n29/36<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is intended as<br />\na broad, introductory course surveying a variety<br />\nof texts, periods, and professors, and it succeeds in its intent. Students should expect to<br />\nread about 1 book a week (non-humanities people<br />\nmay find this a heavy load), write 3 short papers, and take a final, though Dr. Macksey<br />\nplans possible less reading and more emphasis<br />\non short, creative, analytical papers in the future. Grad students grade these papers and, like<br />\nmany grad students in other courses, grade<br />\ncomprehensively but stiffly. Class discussion also enters into the grade. The course seems to<br />\nbe an appealing alternative to the English dept.<br />\nsurvey courses and should be considered by<br />\nanyone with an interest in literature.<br />\n<br />\nMATHEMATICAL<br />\nSCIENCES<br />\nDepartment Statement: For three centuries the<br />\nprincipal applications of mathematics have been<br />\nto engineering and to the classical natural sciences: astronomy, physics, and chemistry. At the<br />\nsame time, these fields have been important<br />\nsources of inspiration and direction in the development of mathematics. Although the classical natural sciences were the first fields in<br />\nwhich mathematics was applied, there are today<br />\nmany others, for example, biology, operations<br />\nresearch, demography, management scinece, economics, information science, psychology,<br />\n,health care systems, sociology, ecology, and<br />\ncomputer science were until only recently either nonexistent or were large descriptive and<br />\nnon -quantitative. Now, however, mathematical<br />\nmethods and models are essential to each of<br />\nthem.<br />\nBasic mathematical methods remain essential<br />\nin the new fields of application, of course, but<br />\na glance at any of \u2022the current journals reveals<br />\n<br />\nthat many newer techniques are in wide use:<br />\nprobability , mathematical programming, statistical analysis and inference, optimal control,<br />\nstochastic processes, game theory, queuing<br />\ntheory, numerical analysis, information theory,<br />\ncombinatories, finite and discrete mathematics,<br />\nand decision theory. For want of any other<br />\nsummary description we shall refer to such<br />\nfields of modern applied mathematics collectively as the mathematical sciences. it is across<br />\nthis spectrum of activities that the programs of<br />\ninstruction and research of the Department of<br />\nMathematical Sciences are spread.<br />\nAt both the graduate and undergraduate levels the department's programs emphasize basic<br />\ntraining in the mathematical disciplines so<br />\nnecessary for science and management in the<br />\n1970's. Students are encouraged to broaden<br />\ntheir background and develop their scientific intuition by electing a variety of courses in the<br />\napplications. A typical program should prepare<br />\nthe student to continue his scientific career in<br />\neither theoretical or applied work (or both), as<br />\nhe chooses.<br />\n<br />\n24.2-3 COMPUTER LAB<br />\nCALCULUS I & II Dr. Horn<br />\nProfessor's Statement: These one-hour courses<br />\nparallel the basic calculus corses. Numerical experiments and computer solution of problems<br />\nare used to illuminate the basic principles of<br />\nthe calculus. No prior computing experience is<br />\nrequired, but co-registration in the corresponding calculuscourseis necessary.<br />\n<br />\n24.11 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<br />\nDr. Pyne<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Students taking this course<br />\nuniversally agree this is a very good course under an excellent teacher. Grading consists of a<br />\ncombination of homework and tests that is very fairly curved. No one should find the work<br />\noverly difficult yet it remains challenging and<br />\ninteresting. The text is very readable and non-specific in nature, a quality found desirable by<br />\nthe heterogeneous group of students taking this<br />\ncourse who want to get a general, introductory<br />\ncourse in practical statistics.<br />\n<br />\n24:55 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nMATH PROGRAMMING<br />\nDr. Elzinga<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a survey course<br />\nfor undergraduates who are curious about optimization methods and applications and who<br />\nwant a thorough survey at an elementary level.<br />\nMuch of the first semester will be spent on the<br />\ntopic of linear programming and other topics<br />\nrelated to it, such as the transportation problem and network flow problems. These subjects, while interesting theoretically, have found<br />\nwide application in industry and government.<br />\nThe second semester will be devoted to a number of other optimization techniques: game<br />\ntheory, dynamic programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming. A computer laboratory to be run in conjunction with the<br />\ncourse for those students knowledgable about<br />\ncomputer programming is being planned. Prerequisites for the course are Math 11.6-7 and<br />\nconcurrent registration in Math 11.10-11; for<br />\nthe computer laboratory, 24.62, Elements of<br />\nComputer Art and Science or equivalent.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Although this is an introductory course in Operations Research, it<br />\nseemed to already be fairly specialized. The<br />\ncourse for the most part was considered<br />\ndifficult with the tests rated particularly hard.<br />\nIn general the grading was considered fair<br />\nalthough there were complaints on the grading<br />\nof the homework. The text received mixed opinions, but the fact that those who expected<br />\nbetter grades rated it higher suggest that it is<br />\nnot that much help for making up what couldn't be understood in class. Students claimed to<br />\nspend 1-8 hours per week on the material with<br />\nthree being about average. This course seems to<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nbe best suited to those students who have a definite prior interest in the material.<br />\n(This review is a reprint of a previous review<br />\nof this professor and course.)<br />\n<br />\n24.62 ELEMENTS OF<br />\nCOMPUTER ART AND<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDr. Naddor<br />\nStudent Evaluation: If you are ever going to<br />\ntake ECAS (and you should--it is the best introduction to computers available, can be fun and<br />\nis not too difficult for those with logical<br />\nminds), we suggest you take ECAS now, while<br />\nDr. Naddor is teaching it. If you wait until<br />\nnext year, there are no guarantees.<br />\n(This evaluation is a reprint from the Fall<br />\n1972 Course Guide.)<br />\n<br />\n24.69 UNDERGRAD SEMINAR<br />\nIN COMPUTER USE AND<br />\nDr. Naddor<br />\nPROGRAMMING<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Students engaged in independent studies in computers report on the<br />\nprogress of their work. Occasionally other computer topics are presented informally by students, faculty, and guests.<br />\nECAS or its equivalent is a prerequisite. Students are encouraged to select relevant and useful projects.<br />\n<br />\n24.301 MATRIX ANALYSIS<br />\nAND LINEAR ALGEGRA<br />\nDr. Horn<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a second course<br />\nin linear algebra with emphasis on those parts<br />\nt of the subject which are useful in analysis, economics, statistics, mathematical programming<br />\nand numerical analysis. Students interested in<br />\nthese areas or in advanced work in science may<br />\nbe interested. Advanced calculus and a first<br />\ncourse in linear algebra are the prerequisites.<br />\n<br />\n24.315 INTRODUCTION<br />\nTO PROBABILITY<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This is a very difficult,<br />\ndemanding course that should not be taken for<br />\na grade by anyone who is not required to take<br />\nit. Students were reluctant to give the professor<br />\nhigh marks on teaching ability, but were very<br />\nwell satisfied with his accessibility. The text is<br />\nunfortunately very poor, with difficult problems and little clear explanation. The applications pertain more to the fields of physics and<br />\nengineering than others. Dr. Donelson gives<br />\nmany examples in problem-solving but does not<br />\ngive any insight into general application of<br />\ntheories other than those covered by specific<br />\nproblems assigned as homework. About half the<br />\ngrade is based on homework, and though the<br />\nprofessor claims no curve, there is a degree of<br />\ncompetition for grades.<br />\n<br />\n24.317 STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS<br />\nDr. Young<br />\n(<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Studies of the behavior<br />\nof stochastic systems Initial emphasis is on a<br />\nreview of relevant stochastic processes and analystic techniques as a framework for understanding queuing phenomena; e.g., compound distributions, solution of differential - difference equ<br />\nations by means of generating functions, discrete and continuous time, Markov processes,<br />\ntime-homogeneous immigration-emigration,<br />\nbirth-death processes, etc. Stochastic systems,<br />\nsuch as single and multiple channel queues, and<br />\nsequential queues are then examined for their<br />\nunique characteristics and with an orientation<br />\ntoward application to real-world problems.<br />\nThis course will be aimed primarily at undergraduate students, with more emphasis in potential real-life application than theoretical virtuosity. Graduate students will be eligible to<br />\nenroll but those with strong math and statistics<br />\nbackground may be bored and may find more<br />\nadvanced courses to their liking.<br />\n<br />\nPage 9<br />\n<br />\n24.319 SIMULATION MODELS<br />\n\u2022 Dr. Greenberger<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This coure will compare<br />\nseveral well known kinds of simulation models,<br />\nincluding Microanalytio models, systems dynamics models, and econometric models. These<br />\nmodels are being used to help decision makers<br />\nforecast the future and weigh policy alternatives. The technical properties of the models<br />\nwill be analyzed along with the characteristics<br />\nof the problems to which the models are being<br />\napplied. The student should be versed in probabiliby theory, difference or differential equations, and computer programming.<br />\n<br />\n24.321 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nPROBABILITY THEORY<br />\nDr. Horn<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Probability spaces, combinatorial analysis, random variables, expectation, generating functions, detailed study of the<br />\ncommon distributions, elementary forms of the<br />\nbasic limit theorems. Emphasis is place more on<br />\nestablishing mathematical results than on applications to other scientific disciplines. A rigorous foundation is laid for further work in probability, stochastic processes or statistical inference.<br />\nPrerequisite: 11.10-11 or the equivalent and<br />\nco-registration in 11.315 or the equivalent.<br />\n\"A student who is interested in seeing clearly<br />\nwhat questions probability theory may answer<br />\nand gaining the ability to answer these questions himself in his own field will benefit greatly from this course.\"<br />\n<br />\n24.332 LEAST SQUARES AND<br />\nREGRESSION ANALYSIS<br />\nDr. Duncan<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a basic course in<br />\nthe graduate program in statistics and biostatistics. It is also aimed at meeting the needs for a<br />\nsound introduction to the theory and methods<br />\nof regression for advanced undergraduates and<br />\ngraduates in a wide variety of other areas including econometrics, psychometrics, environmental engineering, epidemiology, population dynamics.and the like.<br />\n<br />\n24.351 INVENTORY SYSTEMS<br />\nDr. Naddor<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The description in the<br />\n72 \u2014 73 catalog quite adequately describes the<br />\ncourse. Since extensive use is made of probability and digital computations, the prerequisites<br />\nof the course now include calculus (11.6-7), introduction to probability (24.315), and ECAS<br />\n(24.62) or their equivalents.<br />\n<br />\n24.353 FOUNDATIONS OF<br />\nMANAGEMENT SCIENCE<br />\nDr. Flagle<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n3<br />\n8<br />\n12<br />\n5<br />\n28<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Foundations of Management Science was generally thought to be too<br />\neasy for its three credits. The text is easy to<br />\nunderstand and the lecture covers the same basic material as the text with some personal examples of the professor thrown_ in. There was<br />\none exam with the choice of either a final exam or a paper, the exams being taken from the<br />\nlecture and text material. This course is recommended to O.R.'s, business majors, or anyone<br />\ninterested in the subject.<br />\n(Note: last offered as 55.353).<br />\n<br />\nMATHEMATICS<br />\nStatement: Various theories have<br />\nbeen advanced in the past (by us and others) as<br />\nto the. reason or reasons for the Mathematics<br />\n<br />\ndepartment not listing the professors for various classes. These theories have ranged from<br />\nmalicious (\"if they told who was teaching no<br />\none would sign up for the course\") to semi-logical (\"the Math department feels that any<br />\nprofessor is capable of teaching any course, so<br />\nprofessors are told during the summer\") to<br />\nnaive (\"the department never knows who is going to leave at any given time\"). We are happy<br />\nto be able to take this opportunity to clear up<br />\nany misunderstandings. The Math department<br />\ndoes not list professors because they do not<br />\nknow how many will be required for the lower<br />\nlevel courses. So assignments are given out after<br />\nthe number of students (before drops) is obtained. Logical, yes?<br />\nWe do, however, want to note that the department has made significant changes (the addition of 11 5', a \"review course\"; a complete<br />\nrestructuring of the lower level math progression; and a serious attempt to reduce the class<br />\nsizes for those lower level courses)Kudos to Dr.<br />\nSampson.<br />\n<br />\n11.301 ANALYSIS FOR SOCIAL<br />\nAND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES<br />\nDr. Meyer<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a course on differential equations and calculus of variations,<br />\nwith emphasis on applications in the biological<br />\nand social sciences. This includes detailed study<br />\nof specific models in fields such as physiology,<br />\necology, and economics. There were two examinations and one term paper. The only prerequisite is one year of calculus.<br />\nSpecial Note \u2014 Correction: In the Fall,<br />\n1972 issue an incorrect review of Mathematics<br />\ncourse number 11.301, Analysis for Social and<br />\nBehavioral Sciences, was printed. The correct<br />\nreview is as follows.<br />\nStudent reaction to this course was, without<br />\nexception, positive and enthusiastically so. A<br />\ngreat deal of material was covered, but not in<br />\ngreat depth, according to students. Some work<br />\noutside of class was required, but this was not<br />\nconsidered excessive. Perhaps the greatest value<br />\nof the course was that it presented what are often considered esoteric techniques in an informal manner, thus making the material understandable on an intuitive basis. Dr. Meyer was<br />\nrated as most helpful and usually well-prepared.<br />\nFor those people outside of physics, statistics,<br />\nor actual math majors, this course is enthusiastically recommended for those who desire a<br />\nworking knowledge of mathematical analysis<br />\nwithout studying the most esoteric details.<br />\n<br />\nMECHANICS AND<br />\nMATERIAL SCI.<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of Mechanics and Materials Science is the new name<br />\nfor the Department of Mechanics. In order to<br />\nmake full use of the broad interests of the faculty in undergraduate teaching and in order to<br />\nmaintain its position as the department ranked<br />\nfirst irr overall undergraduate satisfaction, as established by the responses to the Blue Ribbon<br />\nPanel's Undergraduate Questionnaire, several<br />\nimportant changes have been made. The department is now a part of the Natural Sciences as<br />\nwell as the Engineering Sciences and for the<br />\nfirst time offers undergraduate programs leading<br />\nto the Bachelor of Arts degree as well as the<br />\nBachelor of Engineering Science degree. All undergraduate courses are open to itudents in all<br />\ndepartments and all area majors. Moreover, the<br />\ndepartment offers accelerated programs, open<br />\nto all qualified undergraduates, which permit<br />\nadmission to graduate study as early as the end<br />\nof the sophomore year and which permit students to receive their bachelor's degree as well<br />\nas a master's or doctor of philosophy degree.<br />\nA number of new courses deserve special<br />\nmention, namely The Science of Modem Materials, The Mechanics of Animal Motion, Introductory Lectures on Acoustics, Materials Science Laboratory, Principles of Acoustics, Advanced Materials Science, Introduction to Ten-<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nsor Analysis, and Topics in Applied Mathematics.<br />\nThe faculty of the Department of Mechanics<br />\nand Materials Science is eager to discuss programs and individual courses with all undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\n50.11 THE SCIENCE OF<br />\nMODERN MATERIALS<br />\nDr. Pond<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Virtually all takers of this<br />\nintroductory course (two-thirds freshmen)<br />\nfound it stimulating, worthwhile, and enjoyable. Dubbed \"Metal Man\" for his enthusiasm<br />\nfor the subject, Dr. Pond is the prime asset of<br />\nthe course. The lectures, based on but not limited to handout lecture notes written by Pond<br />\nhimself, successfully balance theory and practice and stimulate the discussion that makes for<br />\na comfortable classroom atmosphere. Some students were inspired to extra efforts on their<br />\nown, while all agreed that the amount of work<br />\nrequired was just right for the credits. The<br />\nstraight grading, based 20% each on 4 open<br />\nbook hourlies and 20% on a paper, was cited as<br />\nfair and acceptable by all. Requiring no special<br />\nbackground, the course was recommended to<br />\nall, whether interested in engineering or just in<br />\nthe world around them.<br />\n<br />\n50.15 INTRODUCTORY<br />\nLECTURES ON ACOUSTICS<br />\nDrs. Hartman<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course provides an<br />\nintroductory overview of the broad field of<br />\nacoustics. During the first hour of each meeting<br />\na guest scientist or engineer will lecture on the<br />\narea of his experience pertaining to acoustics.<br />\nThe lectures are designed for the non -specialist,<br />\nincluding the Homewood freshman, who is interested in acquiring an interdisciplinary perspective of both the good and bad features of<br />\nmany acoustic phenomena. Some topics are<br />\nPhysiology of Hearing and Speech, Acoustics of<br />\nMusic, Bio-Acoustics, Ultrasonics and its<br />\nApplications, Noise Pollution and Noise Control. The second hour is used for open<br />\ndiscussion of the preceding lectures and for a<br />\ncontinuing development of the basic physics of<br />\nsound and the methods of its measurement and<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nThe guest speakers include professors from<br />\nthe Departments of Bio-Medical Engineering,<br />\nPsychiatry, Otology and Laryngology, Biology,<br />\nPsychology, Electrical Engineering, Mechanics<br />\nand Materials Science, and local engineers and<br />\npoliticians. Some class notes are distributed and<br />\nparticipants are requested to obtain a copy of<br />\nan elementary book on the general properties,<br />\nuses and abuses of sound.<br />\nStudents will be provided with summaries of<br />\nthe lectures and lists of suggested reading pertaining to each lecture. Each student is required<br />\nto write a short paper on any topic which is<br />\nrelevant to acoustics. No additional assignments<br />\nor examinations are given.<br />\n<br />\nMEASUREMENT AND<br />\n50.51<br />\nEXPERIMENTATION<br />\nDr. Kovasznay<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course consists of a<br />\nseries of non-related experiments touching on<br />\nmany important topics in engineering. The<br />\nform for the course is three hours of lecture every other week, with the intervening weeks be<br />\n- ing devoted to three hour lab sessions.<br />\nThe weakness of the course is the material<br />\npresented by Dr. Kovasznay. His lectures tend<br />\nto ramble, often containing discussions unrelated to the topic of the coming lab. The labs<br />\nare more concerned with quantitative methods<br />\nand the corresponding lab reports involved a<br />\ngreat deal of compilation of data and calculations. Grading is fairly rigorous.

This is a<br />\nnew course, given for the first time this year,<br />\nand is designed to permit undergraduates of all<br />\nages and backgrounds to participate successfully. The only requirement for the course is that<br />\neach gjoup of students must produce a sound<br />\nmovie (at least 100 ft. long) on some aspect of<br />\nmaterials. The content of the movie may be artistically pleasing or a technical exposition.<br />\nchoice of topic and method of production is<br />\nleft to the student. The professor and graduate<br />\njunior instructors serve as technical assistants<br />\nfor the undergraduates;. and assist them by supplying scientific advice, references to the<br />\nliterature, laboratory equipment, television and<br />\nmovie cameras, other photographic equipment,<br />\nand supplies. Undergraduates interested in the<br />\nmovies made during the current year are encouraged to watch the Newsletter for announcement of our special screening session<br />\nwhich will be open to the public.<br />\n<br />\nmentary problems, exercises are designed to aid<br />\nin understanding the principles and a few problems are solved in complete detail. Printed<br />\nnotes will be distributed weekly. No text is required for 301, while 302 usually requires a<br />\ntext.<br />\nStudents are expected to submit for grading<br />\ntheir work on the assigned weekly exercises.<br />\nThese exercises and related topics are disciissed in the weekly conference session. Three<br />\nlectures are given each week. Approximately<br />\nthree one-hour quizzes are given each semester.<br />\nThe final exam includes a take-home open-book<br />\npart and an in-class closed-book part. Grades<br />\nare assigned primarily in correlation with the<br />\nperformance on the final exams; however,<br />\nquizzes and homeworks are considered if they<br />\nhelp improve the student's grade.<br />\nI*<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Complaints were rampant<br />\nand kudos virtually absent from the responses<br />\nfor this course. Among the unpopular aspects<br />\nwere lengthy and difficult home assignments,<br />\ntoo much work for the 4 credits, lack of a<br />\ntext, and excessively theoretical lectures assuming prior knowledge not in the students'<br />\nbackgrounds. Grading is based on 3 quizzes and<br />\na comprehensive final, although the students indicated that they were unsure of the type of<br />\ngrading. The consensus among those who recommended it to anyone at all was to recommend the course Lo mechanics majors and those<br />\ninterested in advanced mechanics.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Green is a very warm<br />\nand friendly guy. He seems not to be concerned with grades and is very interested in the<br />\ncourse he has set up. This course is a refreshing<br />\nbreak from a lot of typical courses. The course<br />\nconsists of a project involved with making a<br />\nmovie on materials and is graded subjectively.<br />\nThere is no required text, and the amount of<br />\nwork required was termed just right. Dr. Green<br />\ngoes over any material you need to know. This<br />\nlab is recommended for people who like to<br />\nmake movies and anyone with an interest in<br />\nmaterials.<br />\n<br />\n50.301 PRINCIPLES OF<br />\nMECHANICS Dr. Hartman<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSeniors<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n50.307 FLUID MECHANICS<br />\nDr. Corrsin<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n3<br />\n8<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course establishes<br />\nand uses the principles necessary to describe<br />\nand predict the motion of several kinds of bodies which are subjected to a variety of forces.<br />\nSome specific motions include the study of vibrations of mass points, orbiting planets,<br />\nhanging cables, gyroscopes, engaging gears, billPiard balls,<br />\n40. stretching,<br />\nbending and<br />\n,twisting of<br />\n'\".solid rods,<br />\nwaves in solids<br />\nand fluids,<br />\nand fluid flow<br />\nin pipes.<br />\nI This course<br />\nemphasizes a<br />\nrational approach to the<br />\nmechanics of<br />\nboth rigid and<br />\ndeformable<br />\nmaterials.

No<br />\nprior knowledge of fluid mechanics is assumed,<br />\nbut the entering student should have completed<br />\nat least one term of intermediate level theoretical mechanics (e.g., 50.301 or 17.303), and<br />\nshould not blanch at the sight of a linear, ordinary differential equation. The course is designed for seniors or first-year graduate students<br />\nin engineering and physical sciences including<br />\ngeophysical sciences.<br />\nEmphasis is on physical understanding of the<br />\nmost common flow phenomena, with frequent<br />\nrecourse to mathematical modelling and to approximate solutions, especially of resulting nonlinear differential equations. Specific examples<br />\ninclude not only intrinsically motivated boundary value problems, but also the simplest flows<br />\nrelated to engineering, meteorology, oceanography, biology and everyday experience. Flow<br />\nmovies are shown nearly every week, outside<br />\nregular lecture hours. I hope that by the end of<br />\nthe year the student will have some perspective<br />\nof the field, with an idea of how the special<br />\nclasses of theoretical approximations relate to<br />\neach other and to flows of the real world.<br />\nMost exams are take-home, open book; undergraduates are graded independently of graduate students.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Recommended by its students to math and mechanics majors and the<br />\nlike, the course is said to require work commensurate with its 3 credits. The lectures enlarge and review<br />\nthe material in Dr.<br />\nCorrisin's notes,<br />\nwhich form the<br />\ncourse text. Most<br />\nrespondents said<br />\nthe course was<br />\nneither too theoretical nor too practical; there was<br />\nsome criticism of<br />\nthe notes. The lectures review old<br />\nmaterial, go over<br />\nthe class notes,<br />\nand sometimes<br />\ncover additional topics. Most students did not<br />\nindicate how the course was graded; those who<br />\ndid disagreed on the type of grading but<br />\nthought the grading would be fair. It is apparently based on a take home comprehensive final and weekly homework.<br />\n<br />\n50.313 ELEMENTS OF<br />\nPHYSICAL METALLURGY<br />\nDr. Pond<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Recommended. by its students to mechanics majors and those interested<br />\nin metals, the course met with favorable overall<br />\nresponse from the eleven in the course. Said to<br />\nrequire just the right effort for the credits, the<br />\ncourse balances theory and practice. The lectures, neither repeating nor requiring material<br />\nfrom other courses, enlarge on .the material in<br />\nthe text, which was deemed fair. Grading,<br />\nbased on moderate amounts of homework and<br />\non open book hourlies from the text and lectures, was also considered to be fair.<br />\n<br />\n50.323 THERMODYNAMICS<br />\nDr. Schwartz<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n2<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course seemed generally well received by the students -- there was only an oral final exam, being 100% of the grade,<br />\nand one or two homework assignments. The<br />\namount of work required was termed \"just<br />\nright\", but a general criticism was that it was<br />\ntoo theoretical for most students. However, it<br />\nseems to be the best thermodynamics course on<br />\ncampus and is strongly recommended for mechanics, engineering, and general science majors.<br />\n<br />\nMILITARY<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Army ROTC Program at Hopkins is tailored to the Homewood<br />\nCampus environment. Formal aspects of the<br />\nprogram are detailed in the University catalog<br />\nand further information is available from the<br />\nDirector, Military Science Program,(Phone 294,<br />\n295,or 656). We expect to enroll women students beginning September,1973. Any Hopkins<br />\nstudent may take or audit any of the ROTC<br />\ncourses. A relatively popular one in the past<br />\nhas been American Military Heritage. Our<br />\n\"leadership laboratory\" consists of monthly<br />\nfour-hour sessions rather than the usual weekly<br />\none-hour affairs. These are planned and execu-<br />\n<br />\nted by the cadets and emphasize outdoor activity. In addition to the four one-year standardized courses, we offer two optional non- academic courses: mountaineering, orienteering, and<br />\nsurvivalias well as self-defense. These are free of<br />\ncharge and open to all students.<br />\nEditor's Note: Military Science courses, beginning this fall, will be academically oriented and<br />\nwill not be concerned with practical military<br />\nskills, which will be taught in the four hour<br />\ndrills once a month. Students may take any of<br />\nthe four courses (listed below) without joining<br />\nROTC, getting a uniform, or participating in<br />\ndrills (\"leadership labs\"). The courses are for<br />\nnon-credit, and as a result do not involve a particularly significant work load.<br />\n<br />\n12.1 GENERAL MILITARY<br />\nSCIENCE I Major Trapnell<br />\nProfessor's Statement: (Instructor has been<br />\nchanged.) Tentatively titled \"The Military and<br />\nSociety,\" the course will revolve around two<br />\nmain themes: problems of society and their impact on the military, and internal problems of<br />\nthe military which may or may not be mirrored<br />\nin other segments of society. There will be scattered readings from a variety of sources.<br />\n<br />\n12.3 MILITARY HERITAGE<br />\nCpt. Dombrowsky<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The emphasis in the<br />\ncourse is not so much on the U.S. Army's successes (and failures) in war as it is the reasons<br />\nfor the outcomes of battles and wars. Though<br />\nthe course covers the period from the Revolutionary War through Vietnam, it will not be in<br />\nstrictly chronological order. Rather, an attempt \u2022<br />\nwill be made to carry through various changes<br />\nand trends as they affect wars and battles. The<br />\nemphasis will be on the twentieth century.<br />\n<br />\n12.5 SEMINAR IN<br />\nLEADERSHIP AND<br />\nMANAGEMENT<br />\nCpt. Pearson & Cpt. Hemphill<br />\nProfessors' Statement: The course will focus on<br />\nthe factors that affect leadership and management, and some manners and means of improvement. Subject matter will be from various<br />\nfields: Psychology, Operations Research, Organizational Theory, and others.<br />\n<br />\n12.7 THE MILITARY TEAM<br />\nMajor Trapnell<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The main theme will be<br />\nco-operation and problem solving within the<br />\nframework and organization of the Army. An<br />\nattempt will be made to simulate the organization and the roles to be played within it, to<br />\nstudy conflict, co-operation , and compromise<br />\nthat result from responsibilities of different leadership positions.<br />\n<br />\nNEAR<br />\nEASTERN<br />\nSTUDIES<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of<br />\nNear Eastern Studies offers courses in the civilizations of the ancient Near East. This covers<br />\nthe entire fertile crescent from Mesopotamia in<br />\nthe east to Egypt in the west. This geographical<br />\nextension is matched by the span of time dealt<br />\nwithini the department \u2014 approximately three<br />\nmillenia. Although the emphasis of the department is in philological work, there is great concern to portray the ancient Near East as a culvirally integrated area consisting of regions<br />\nwith their own individual developments. Like<br />\nthe personality, it is a compound of literature,<br />\nreligion, and history which makes up the intellectual patterns of these parts. The department<br />\noffers courses in these fields, in addition to<br />\nNear-Eastern archaeology. None of these courses<br />\n<br />\nPage 11<br />\nrequire any previous training although familiarity with a foreign language is helpful. In addition, all graduate courses in the department are<br />\nopen to anyone, provided the person can meet<br />\nthe standards of such a course. There is no distinction between graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents because the aim of the department is<br />\nthe intellectual adventure of the ancient Near<br />\nEast at the earliest stage of recorded human<br />\nhistory.<br />\n<br />\n13.7 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nISLAMIC CIVILIZATION<br />\nDr. Krotkoff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The purpose of the<br />\ncourse is to present the basic facts about one<br />\nof the main civilizations of humanity, which is<br />\ngreatly ignored or misunders .,od in the West.<br />\nThe emphasis will be on backgronnd, formagre:i. intellection, and periods and areas<br />\not<br />\ntual and artistic productivity<br />\n.ed.<br />\nboth, Arabs and Persians, \u2018. 1 bc<br />\navailaSlides and films (the latter dependi<br />\nObjectbility) will be shown during the cow<br />\nive tests on Geography, History,and Religion<br />\nwill be administered. Students must be prepared to read 3 to 4 medium sized books.<br />\nNote: This course is a prerequisite for Islamic<br />\nLiterature.<br />\n<br />\n13.309 GOD AND MAN IN<br />\nANCIENT EGYPT<br />\nDr. Goedicke<br />\nStudent Evaluation: While there was a general<br />\nenjoyment of the material presented in lectures,<br />\nresponses concerning Man and God in Ancient<br />\nEgypt often stated severe condemnations of Dr.<br />\nGoedicke's attitude toward class discussion.<br />\nComplaints concerned the professor's dogmatic<br />\nand condescending manner of answering<br />\nquestions posed by the students. Classroom atmosphere was described by some in such extremes as tyrannical and \"reminiscent of Auschwitz,\" although most criticisms of the class had<br />\na milder tone. On the positive side, several students found Dr. Goedicke a fascinating man<br />\nand claimed they enjoyed his ability and witty<br />\nhandling of questions. He was described by<br />\nsome as very knowledgable. Also, the readings,<br />\nnone of which arerequired, are considered good.<br />\nIf the student has an interest in the area of ancient Egyptian religion and is not easily intimidated, this might be a course to consider taking. Those who tend toward paranoia should<br />\nnot attempt it, however.<br />\n(Reprint)<br />\n<br />\n13.319 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nTHE ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY<br />\nOF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST<br />\nDr. Carter<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Overall response to this<br />\ncourse was positive. The only negative statements were suggestions that friends not take the<br />\ncourse, but this seems to be due to the fact<br />\nthat the subject is a little esoteric and unfamiliar, rather than due to intrinsic fault(s) of the<br />\ncourse itself. Lectures were described as interesting, unanimously as well-organized, and the<br />\ninterest seemed to be due to the inclusion of<br />\nantifactual and visual material. Exams were<br />\nconsidered both difficult and suitable; grading<br />\n\"fair,\" \"good system;\" class atmosphere, both<br />\ninformal and relaxed. Attendance appears high.<br />\nA stressed factor was the fact that the student<br />\nwho takes the course must be interested in the<br />\nsubject, i.e. motivation is a must.<br />\n(Reprin t<br />\n<br />\nNON<br />\nDEPARTMENTAL<br />\n30.353 THE GREAT TRADITION<br />\nIN MUSIC<br />\nDr. Galkin<br />\nStudent Evaluation:This is one of the very few<br />\nmusic courses offered, but luckily for<br />\n<br />\n\fSpring 1973<br />\n<br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nbuffs it is also one of the most interesting and<br />\nenjoyable courses available at Hopkins.<br />\nThe course itself is described as \"relaxed\"<br />\nand fairly easy. There are no tests, and just one<br />\nfinal paper of 15-20 pages. This paper constitutes the only real work in the course, aside<br />\nfrom attending classes. Though unstructured,<br />\nthe class is interesting and rated between very<br />\ngood and excellent. The students themselves<br />\nwere partially responsible for this, with the at-mosphere relaxed, and classmates described as<br />\ninterested and intelligent but definitely not<br />\nthroatish.<br />\nThe professor, Elliot Galkin, is undoubtedly<br />\nthe reason for the class's high degree of success.<br />\nHe is rated very highly in all aspects, and described as an \"encyclopedia of music,\" but still<br />\ncasual, interesting and even entertaining. His<br />\nrambling style and the lack of structure in his<br />\nlectures were sometimes noted as weaknesses,<br />\nalthough the majority of students felt these<br />\ncharacteristics were not only appropriate to the<br />\nmaterial covered, but were also vital to the relaxed nature and appeal of the course.<br />\nThe only recommendation that the students<br />\nhad were that more courses in music be offered, on any topic, just so long as a greater selection be made available.<br />\n<br />\nPHILOSOPHY<br />\nDepartment Statement: Courses in the Philosophy Department provide historical and systematic apprnaches to philosophical issues. Historical<br />\ncourses study answers that Western philosophers of the past have given to such questions<br />\nas what moral principles men should follow and<br />\nwhy; the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body; what knowledge consists of<br />\nand how it is possible for man to have knowledge of an external world, of objects in science<br />\nthat he cannot observe, and of the minds of<br />\nothers; whether determinism is true and if so<br />\nwhether it is. possible for then to act freely;<br />\nwhat principles of reasoning men ought to use.<br />\nSystematic courses in ethics, metaphysics, and<br />\nthe philosophy of the mind will focus on a single topic or group of topics and will often consider both historical and contemporary approaches. Courses in the philosophy of science,<br />\nthe philosophy of history, and philosophy in literature examine philosophical and methodological problems that arise in the various disciplines. Courses in logic study formal techniques<br />\nand principles of modern symbolic logic.<br />\nBasically, the aim of philosophy courses is to<br />\nget students to think critically and analytically<br />\nabout philosophical issues. This is done not by<br />\npresenting one final, dogmatic position, but by<br />\nexamining a variety of approaches and by training students to raise questions that will expose<br />\nunjustified assumptions, logical connections between claims, fallacies in reasoning, and the<br />\nneed for sustained argumentation.<br />\n<br />\n15.11 PHILOSOPHIC<br />\nCLASSICS<br />\nDr. Mandelbaum<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course is intended<br />\nto be an introduction to philosophy which raises some of the basic problems of philosophy; it<br />\ndoes so through readings and discussions of<br />\nphilosophic works which lend themselves to<br />\nthis approach.<br />\nIn the spring term of 1973, the syllabus was<br />\ndrastically revised as compared with previous<br />\nyears; it cut down on the number of philosophers studied, and it attempted to broaden the<br />\nbase of the problems discussed. The three philosophers studied in 1973 were John Stuart<br />\nMill, William James, and Nietzsche. Until I conduct a student evaluation comparable to those I<br />\nhave conducted in other years, I cannot know<br />\nwhether I shall continue to confine the course<br />\nthe same 19th and 20th century authors, or<br />\nack to something more like<br />\n<br />\nearlier syllabi. It is unlikely, however, that the<br />\ncourse will include any works earlier than Descartes.<br />\nWhether or not there will be one or more<br />\nshort papers in the course depends on the authors to be studied. There will in any case be an<br />\nhour exam and a traditional style final.<br />\n<br />\n15.39 TUTORIAL SEMINAR<br />\nDr. Gottlieb<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will be an<br />\nattempt to see Judaism from the inside, in<br />\nterms of its own concepts and values. The<br />\nscope will include the quality of the religious<br />\ndimension of experience, as well as the fundamentals of Jewish faith and ideology. Although<br />\nboth modern (e.g. Heschel, Buber) and classical<br />\n(Bible, Talmud) will be used, the course is open<br />\nto all undergraduates regardless of Jewish or<br />\nphilosophical background. It will be run as<br />\nmuch as possible as a seminar: students will be<br />\nasked to lead discussions on assigned readings.<br />\nTwo papers will be required \u2014 one five pager<br />\nfor the mid-term and one ten pager at the end<br />\nof the semester.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: As usual, the comments on<br />\nDr. Mandelbaum's course ranged from excellent<br />\nto superb to fantastic. The course itself was<br />\nthought to be interesting, but the tests were<br />\nconsidered difficult with stiff but fair grading.<br />\nThe conferences were almost a total waste of<br />\ntime and only provided a contrast to Dr. Mandelbaum's shining example, which was the main<br />\nattraction of the course.<br />\n(Reprint)<br />\n<br />\n15.35 PHILOSOPHY OF<br />\nRELIGION<br />\nDr. Barker<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: All ten respondants said<br />\nDr. Gottlieb was an excellent professor. Adjectives used included interesting, energetic, knowledgable, enthusiastic. Those not planning to<br />\nmajor in Philosophy split about 50 \u2014 50 on<br />\ntheir desire to take more courses in the department, somewhat atypical for a philosophy<br />\ncourse. The only complaint (there is always at<br />\nleast one complaint) was that the workload<br />\n(much reading plus one ten-page paper) was excessive for a one-credit course. (Note: the review is from Dr. Gottlieb's Spring 1972 freshman seminar on \"Pragmatism: Truth, Knowledge, and Religion.\")<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will deal<br />\nwith philosophical problems concerning religion<br />\nand religious belief. Topics to be treated include faith and rationality, religious uses of language, theology and meaningness, mysticism,<br />\nevil and predestination. The course will not offer a survey of world religions nor will it concentrate on any one particular religion. It will<br />\nbe concerned with certain intellectual problems<br />\nthat arise for anyone who tries to think clearly<br />\nabout religion. The viewpoints of a variety of<br />\nphilosophers and theologians will be considered<br />\ncritically. There will be some short papers to<br />\nwrite and a final examination.<br />\n<br />\n15.309 SYMBOLIC LOGIC<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Barker strikes again!<br />\nHis coverage of the material was clear,<br />\nthorough,and spiced liberally with his very dry<br />\nwit. However, the lectures were often<br />\nrepetitious and slow moving, as Dr. Barker wandered off onto trivial tangents. The readings<br />\nwere noted as excellent in all respects, but constituting a reasonably heavy work load and demanding several hours each week. Tests are almost objective and come straight from the<br />\nreadings and lecture notes. Paper topics were<br />\nlimited, and a greater selection would prove<br />\nhelpful. The grading was fair and was based on<br />\ntwo papers, a midterm, and a final, but one<br />\nsnag was nitpicking quizzes given in conference<br />\nsections, making attendance there necessary. If<br />\nyou would like a general philosophy course delivered in an understated manner, this could be<br />\nit.<br />\n(Reprint)<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gottlieb<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n29/39<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is a must for<br />\nanyone with even a vague interest in logic or<br />\nfor anyone whose major has logical aspects. Dr.<br />\nGottlieb is an enthused, knowledgable, and altogether excellent teacher (though a strict grader and perhaps a bit fast) who is genuinely interested in having his students master the difficult material thoroughly. This is evidenced by<br />\nhis excellent, mimeographed notes to the reading. There is not a great deal of work in the<br />\ncourse, but time is required to master it. The<br />\ncourse looks like a good way for quantitative<br />\nand engineering people to pick up pass/fail H<br />\ncredits. Someone electing the course should<br />\nhave some math or philosophy background.<br />\n<br />\n4-211<br />\n<br />\n\fP. e 13<br />\n<br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\n<br />\n15.331 PHILOSOPHY OF<br />\nSCIENCE Dr. Achinstein<br />\n<br />\nwho responded (approximately half the class<br />\nwas composed of pads) were satisfied with almost all aspects of the class except the teaching<br />\nassistant, who was called \"rude\" by one student and \"not quite qualified\" by the other.<br />\nThe course was considered to be exactly what<br />\nits title said: an introduction to a field of<br />\nphysics.<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The aim of, the course is<br />\nto study the philosophical and methodological<br />\nassumptions to which scientists are or ought to<br />\nbe committed. Is there one rational method for<br />\nScientists, several, or perhaps none at all? To<br />\nwhat patterns, if any, should scientific explanations conform? Do theories describe reality or<br />\nare they merely symbolic instruments for making predictions? Readings will be from contemporary writings within the philosophy of<br />\nscience, and attention will be given to the views<br />\nof those who construe science as an idealized,<br />\nlogical system;as well as to those who view science in a less abstract, more historical fashion.<br />\n<br />\nROMANCE<br />\nLANGUAGES<br />\n21.1 FRENCH ELEMENTS<br />\nProfessor's Statement: French Elements is designed for students with little or no previous instruction in French.

Classroom participation is essential<br />\n<br />\n15.343 ANALYTIC<br />\nPHILOSOPHY IN THE 20TH<br />\nCENTURY<br />\nDr. Barker<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will offer a<br />\nsurvey of British and American analytic philosophy, starting with Moore and Russell, proceeding to Wittgenstein and Logical Positivism,<br />\nand then concluding ,with more recent linguistic<br />\nphilosophy such as that of Quine. Ryle, and<br />\nAustin. ProblFius in, metaphysics. theory of<br />\nknowledge,. an e4Jics will be treated. The aim<br />\nof the course is to. otter an over7view of the recent history of this influential movement in<br />\nphilosophy. There will be some short papers to<br />\nwrite and a Final examination.<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: French Elements was well<br />\nreceived, and the instructors were commended<br />\nfor being very able and enthusiastic. The work<br />\nload was moderate, most students feeling that<br />\ntwo to four hours per week was all that was<br />\nnecessary. The text was sharply criticized and<br />\nseemed to be the worst part of the course. The<br />\nlanguage lab was also considered to be a waste<br />\nof time. Even though this course was taken for<br />\nrequirement fulltillment, the students enjoyed<br />\nthe course and the instructors.<br />\n<br />\nPHYSICS<br />\n17.3 GENERAL PHYSICS FOR<br />\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE MAJORS II<br />\nDr. Henry<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n38<br />\n4<br />\n46<br />\n15/46<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Special relativity , electromagnetism, optics and wave motion in the<br />\nfirst semester; quantum physics in the second<br />\nsemester. This is a fast-moving tough-minded introduction to the basic ideas of modern physics, designed to build an intellectual base for<br />\nmore advanced work. It should be fun, if you<br />\nrefuse to let it scare you. Problems every week,<br />\nand frequepests with no final.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Most of the respondents<br />\nrecommended this course, but with reservations. The students found the text good to excellent, and most learned a great deal as a result. They felt that Dr. Henry's lectures were<br />\ntoo fast and that too much (and difficult) material was presented in them. Half of the students found Dr. Henry interested in the students and willing to answer questions in class,<br />\nwhile the other half did not.<br />\nThe majority of people spent 10 to 20 hours<br />\na week on outside work, thus felt the 5 credits<br />\nquite appropriate. Perhaps a bit less time would<br />\nhave been necessary, had the answers in the<br />\nback been more than 2/3 correct. All in all,<br />\nthis course is recommended if you have time<br />\nfor long lectures, long tests, and a lot of hard,<br />\nbut worthwhile outside study.<br />\n<br />\n17.305 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY<br />\nDr. Zdanis<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n4<br />\n9<br />\n21<br />\n2/21<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The two graduate students<br />\n<br />\n21.5 INTERMEDIATE FRENCH:<br />\nREADING, CONVERSATION,<br />\nCOMPOSITION<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The goal of this course<br />\nis to develop speaking and writing skills.

I hope to include in it (1) some discussion of the significance of the concept of<br />\ntranslation for literary theory,(2) a brief consideration of translation as it has been understood and practiced at different times, (3) a<br />\ncomparative study of some sample translations,<br />\nand (4) practical work in translation from Engh<br />\nsh to Frech and from French to English. The<br />\npractical work, which should take up more<br />\nthan half the course, will cover various types of<br />\nscientific texts. newspaper and magazine<br />\ntext<br />\narticles, diplomatic texts, private letters, historical narratives, fictional narratives and. poetic<br />\ntexts. The different problems which each of<br />\nthese types presents to the translator will, I<br />\nhope, illuminate both the nature of translation<br />\nand the nature of texts.<br />\n<br />\n21.29 SPANISH ELEMENTS<br />\nCourse Distributioi.

Most of them .had laready had two or three years of high-school<br />\nSpanish; the material in Spanish elements was<br />\nfamiliar. Reviews can be very enjoyable, and<br />\nthis course was no exception. Discussion was<br />\nemphasized, so one could get in some good<br />\npractice of conversational skills. Weekly quizzes, language lab, four exams throughout the<br />\ncourse, and readings comprised the usual tools<br />\nof the trade for this beginning language course.<br />\nThe grad instructor was well-received by students; his interest, enthusiasm, and knowledge<br />\nmade 21.29 more than an empty formality for<br />\npeople who want easy credits. The pace was<br />\nfast, as most of the students already knew their<br />\nstuff. A novice, however, might have found it<br />\nrough going. (Note: this review covers one of<br />\nthe two sections of 21.29 taught last fall.)<br />\n<br />\n21.47 SPANISH<br />\nCONVERSATION &<br />\nDr. Rivers<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Two textbooks will be<br />\nused: one\u2022 emphasizes vocabulary study and<br />\nword usage in everyday \"newspaper\" Spanish;<br />\nthe other is a collection of modern short stories, to be used as a basis for discussion in class.<br />\nThe course is designed to improve the active<br />\ncommand of spoken and written Spanish on<br />\nthe part of students who have a firm grasp of<br />\nfundamental grammar and vocabulary.<br />\n<br />\n21.301 FRENCH FOR<br />\nREADING KNOWLEDGE<br />\nCOMPOSITION<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course is for students who have completed French Elements at<br />\nHopkins or have the equivalent background,<br />\nand for graduate students who wish to prepare<br />\nfor a reading exam. The grammar is oriented<br />\ntowards developing reading comprehension and<br />\ntranslation skills. Reading material is chosen to<br />\nfulfill the needs of the students in their major<br />\nfields. Oral skills are not emphasized and the<br />\ncourse is conducted in English.<br />\n<br />\n21.313 FRENCH THEATER<br />\nTO THE REVOLUTION<br />\nDr. Gossrnan<br />\nProfessor's Statement: In addition to the main<br />\ndramatic texts, there will be discussion of other<br />\nthe theatrical space,<br />\naspects of th.., theatre<br />\nthe various sig.,' systems that constitute the theatrical events (words, gestures, costume, lighting, decor, etc.), and the social function of theatrical art.<br />\n<br />\n21.321 SPANISH NOVEL<br />\nXX C.: THE GENERATION<br />\nDr. Olson<br />\nOF '98<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Lectures and discussion<br />\non five or six novels by such authors as Viramuno, Azorin, Valle-Inclan, and Baroja.

The professor lectured on such poets as Jimenez, Lorca, Guillen,<br />\nand Hernandez, and opportunity was there for<br />\nclass discussion. Two rather involved papers (a<br />\nmedterm and a final) were required as well as<br />\nseveral oral presentations, all dealing with the<br />\npoets covered in the course. This course<br />\nattracts a small and specialized clientele. Prior<br />\ninterest and knowledge are musts. Students<br />\nwere pleased with the course and no problems<br />\nwith grading occurred. (Note: this review is<br />\nfrom Dr. Olson's course last fall \u2014 21.65<br />\nwith the same title. We assume that course<br />\nwhich was characterized as 300-level \u2014 has<br />\nsimply ,been renumbered.)<br />\n<br />\nPOLITICAL<br />\nECONOMY<br />\n18.1 ELEMENTS OF<br />\nECONOMICS(MACRO)<br />\nDr. Christ<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Christ is always wellreceived. In fact, while the reaction to the<br />\ncourse is mixed, Dr. Christ is rated good to excellent by almost everyone. Most students expect an A or B in the course; the few who did<br />\nnot tend to criticize Dr. Christ, Samuelson's<br />\ntext, or the other students. But a surprising<br />\nnumber of 'B' students when asked what they<br />\nlike best about the course, say \"nothing.\"<br />\nDr. Christ has a very open approach to this<br />\nclass and to his students \u2014 there is usually time<br />\nto set aside in lecture for questions and discussion. Current events summary on Monday is<br />\nnice, except for those students who already understand the matters. Perhaps that is the best<br />\nway to summarize the dilemma of this course:<br />\nto present economics simultaneously to math<br />\nand economic majors as well as to the less<br />\nmathematically-oriented student, and to face<br />\nstudents whose economic knowledge ranges<br />\nfrom a great deal to staggering ignorance.<br />\nConference instructor reviews are mixed. A<br />\nfew instructors are good, others incoherent.<br />\nThe existence of an extra-credit paper, which<br />\ncannot count<br />\nagainst the student if he<br />\ndecides to do it but may raise his grade as<br />\nmuch as one letter, should be mentioned, with<br />\nthe warning that the paper is graded very strictly.<br />\nSummary: A not-too-difficult course which<br />\nupon occasion can be boring. Should be taken<br />\nfor the exposure to economics, if nothing else.<br />\n(This evaluation is a reprint from the Spring<br />\n1972 Course Guide.)<br />\n<br />\n18.330 COMPARATIVE<br />\nSYSTEMS AND PLANNING<br />\nDr. Balassa<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Balassa has been very<br />\nsuccessful in presenting a well-organized and interesting course. His lectures are easily followed<br />\nand contain a great deal of information. The<br />\ntests are considered very fair, and the majority<br />\nof the class will find the course very worthwhile and informative. (This evaluation is a reprint from the Spring 1972 Course Guide and<br />\nconsists of material from other courses taught<br />\nby Dr. Balassa.)<br />\n<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\n<br />\n18.337 ECONOMETRICS<br />\nDr. Maccini<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The purpose of the<br />\ncourse is to give the student an introduction to<br />\nempirical work in economics. The course will<br />\ninvolve a development of empirical techniques<br />\nin a non-rigorous and heuristic fashion as well<br />\nas a discussion of empirical work that has been<br />\nperformed in subjecting various economic<br />\ntheories (e.g. the consumption function, investment, etc.) to tests with data. Students will be<br />\nrequired to do a research project of an empirical nature.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: It is rare that the response<br />\nto a professor is as overwhelmingly positive as<br />\nit was to Dr. Maccini, who can only be<br />\ndescribed with glowing adjectives. With interesting, comprehensive, and well-delivered lectures (though sometimes a bit fast to take good<br />\nnotes), Dr. Maccini succeeds in communicating<br />\nthe subject matter, in stimulating student ideas,<br />\nand in fielding questions and problems from<br />\nstudents. Fair with respect to exams and grading, Dr. Maccini did not burden the students<br />\nwith heavy and difficult reading assignments.<br />\n(This evaluation is a reprint from the Fall 1972<br />\nCourse Guide and consists of material taken<br />\nfrom other courses given by Dr. Maccini.)<br />\n<br />\n18.364 EVALUATION OF<br />\nPUBLIC INVESTMENTS<br />\nDr. Sparrow<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This is a course covering a<br />\nwide range of material that is difficult to organize properly, and Dr. Sparrow succumbs to this<br />\ndifficulty. The only common complaint students have about the course is his lack of continuity which is important since lectures are the<br />\nmost educational part of the course. There is<br />\nvery little reading and it is mostly supplementary. The course grade is determined from a<br />\nmidterm and a paper; since Course Guide questionnaires were distributed early in the year the<br />\nlast time this course was given, no information<br />\nis available as to grading policy. Dr. Sparrow<br />\ndoes review pertinent past material as need be<br />\nand does not seem to require learning of difficult concepts.<br />\n<br />\nPOLITICAL,<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of Political Science seeks to promote understanding<br />\nof politics and political behavior as well as the<br />\ninstitutions and processes through which public<br />\npolicy is formed in varying political systems.<br />\nThe department offers a broad range of courses<br />\nabout politics and government at local, state,<br />\nnational, and international levels, including the<br />\nfollowing fields: American politics, comparative<br />\ngovernment and politics, internatidnal law and<br />\nrelations, political theory, public administration<br />\nand public policy, public law and judicial behavior, and urban politics.<br />\nThe political science major is designed for<br />\nstudents interested in intensive study of the institutions and problems of modern government.<br />\nIt is well suited for students aspiring to law<br />\nschool or graduate training in political science.<br />\nOther students interested in the political process<br />\nshould take an area major in the social and behavioral sciences with a concentration in political science. The department also offers a separate program leading to a B.A. or B.A.-M.A. degrees in international studies and participates in<br />\nthe Curriculum for Political Leadership.<br />\n<br />\n19.1 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nAMERICAN GOVERNMENT<br />\nDr. Crenson<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\n<br />\n76<br />\n48<br />\n<br />\n23<br />\n20<br />\n167<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The class expressed much<br />\nsurprise over the approach, expecting a \"constitution and separation of powers\" rehash. Instead there is a philosophical and civil rights approach. Professor Crenson is knowledgeable, interesting, enthusiastic,: and witty. The lectures<br />\nare the high point of the course. The only criticism of the lectures is they often moved too<br />\nquickly for note taking.<br />\nThe readings cannot compete with the lectures. They take maybe four hours weekly and<br />\nprovide supporting evidence for the lectures.<br />\nThe grading is considered fair, but occasionally<br />\narbitrary. So much for splitting hairs.<br />\nBasically, everybody raves about the course.<br />\nDr. Crenson takes a traditionally bust subject<br />\nand presents it well and from an interesting<br />\nperspective.<br />\n<br />\n19.21 AMERICAN PARTIES<br />\nAND POLITICS<br />\nDr. Cummings<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The main element of Professor Cumming's courses seems to be the readings. Readings are generally considered controversial and provoking. The texts are also the<br />\nmost informative part of the course. Dr. Cummings himself is interesting, promotes class discussion and is readily available for consultation<br />\nand questions. The major criticism of Professor<br />\nCummings is his work loads are often far in excess of the credits or course level. The major<br />\npraise of his course is that they are usually<br />\n\"great.\"<br />\n<br />\n19.81 THE PRESIDENT AND<br />\nTHE EXECUTIVE BRANCH<br />\nDr. Rourke<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course deals with<br />\nthe power and activities of the President and<br />\nexecutive agencies. The purpose of the course is<br />\nto understand the kind of influence executive<br />\nofficials, especially the President, have on the<br />\npolitical development of American society. The<br />\ncourse focuses on the presidential office \u2014 the<br />\nroles the President plays, and the sources of executive power. It does not deal in any detail<br />\nwith presidential elections \u2014 the strategies involved in winning a presidential nomination or<br />\nthe factors determining the outcome of presidential elections.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n19.305 POLITICS AND SOCIETY<br />\nIN THE SOVIET UNION<br />\nDr. Gilison<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Gilison apparently is<br />\nwell prepared and well versed. His lectures were<br />\nstimulating and logically presented. The class<br />\nwas conducted in a friendly and relaxed manner. Grading is \"extremely hard\" and there is a<br />\nheavy load of generally excellent reading. As<br />\none student stated, \"be prepared for one grade<br />\nlower than you expect, but take the course any<br />\nway.\" A very good course in an interesting area; well worth the effort. \u2014<br />\n(Reprint.)<br />\n<br />\n1!<br />\n)A<br />\n<br />\n19.309 CONTEMPORARY<br />\nINTERNATIONAL POLITICS<br />\nDr. Rothstein<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n21<br />\n18<br />\n22<br />\n1<br />\n63<br />\n38/63<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The word \"excellent\"<br />\ndominates the comments on most facets of this<br />\ncourse. Dr. Rothstein was consistently and<br />\nhighly praised. The class was amazed by his<br />\n<br />\n21<br />\n<br />\n\fPage 15<br />\n<br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nknowledge, inspired by his interest, and cautioned by his cynicism. Dr. Rothstein's lectures<br />\nwere considered interesting, comprehensive, and<br />\nenjoyable, but occasionally moved too quickly<br />\nto take thorough notes. Dr. Rothstein seems to<br />\nhave the ability to make strategies of nuclear<br />\nannihilation simueltaneously entertaining and<br />\nreal. Questions were taken with interest and answered in detail.<br />\nThe readings for the course are extensive.<br />\nThe readings complemented but did not repeat<br />\nthe lectures. Time claimed to be spent reading<br />\nvaried, but centered on four or five hours<br />\nweekly. Everything is on reserve in Hutzlers.<br />\nMost students said they would recommend<br />\nthe course to others. Many felt satisfied enough<br />\nWith the course not to mind about the grading.<br />\nPeople overly worried about gradepoints should<br />\nremember there are a few \"A\"s and about 50%<br />\nInternational Relations and Political Science<br />\nmajors.<br />\n<br />\n19.311 SEMINAR IN THE<br />\nLEGISLATIVE PROCESS<br />\nDr. Peabody<br />\nProfessor's Statement: My course will follow<br />\nthe general outline of last fall's course with less<br />\nemphasis on congressional elections, and more<br />\non the current conflict between the President<br />\nand Congress. Several new books will be substituted for present readings. The course is primarily designed for students who might wish to<br />\nwork in Congress, understand its complexity, or<br />\nconceivably, some day, run for the House or<br />\nSenate. Why .not? That's the most appropriate<br />\nway to change Congress and ultimately the political system.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Peabody was generally<br />\ndescribed in very favorable terms by his students. While his lectures have a tendency to be<br />\nslowmoving and lacking in structure, they are<br />\nnevertheless interesting. The class especially appreciated the insights gained from Dr. Peabody's personal experiences. The course has a<br />\nrelaxed, seminar-type structure. The readings<br />\nwere a series of mildly interesting paperbacks.<br />\nThe load was rather light. One medium-length<br />\n(15-20 pages) term paper (original research preferred) is required. This paper counts heavily<br />\nbut is fairly graded. There is also a comprehensive, reading-oriented final.<br />\n(Reprint)<br />\n<br />\n19.313 CONTEMPORARY<br />\nPOLITICAL THEORY<br />\nDr. Melvin<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Professor Melvin is deply<br />\ninterested in political,theory. His lectures are<br />\napparently rather dry but interesting, informative, and relevant. There are complaints that<br />\nProfessor Melvin occasionally lectures above the<br />\nclasses' level of understanding. Papers are read<br />\nwell and thoroughly analyzed. Grading is reportedly \"liberal.\"<br />\n<br />\n19.381 GOVERNMENT &<br />\nAND POLITICS OF CHINA<br />\nDr. Pfeffer<br />\nStudent Evaluation: One rarely hears derogatory<br />\ncriticism of Dr. Pfeffer's courses. Typically, the<br />\nlectures are articulate and provoking, occasionally accompanied by slides or films, but are also long and extremely quick. Dr. Pfeffer enjoys<br />\nand promotes class discussion. However, Dr.<br />\nPfeffer thoroughly examines both comment and<br />\npapers. He provides very comprehensive and<br />\nconstructive criticism of students' work. The<br />\nreadings tend to be more than extensive, often<br />\nrather difficult. The general consensus is the<br />\ncourse involves an immense amount of work,<br />\nbut if you have any interest in China, the<br />\ncourse is profitable.<br />\n<br />\nPSYCHOLOGY<br />\n20.1 INTRO TO LEARNING<br />\nDrs. Hulse & Egeth<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n23/44<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Although billed as an introductory course, many students without previous exposure to psychology found this course<br />\ntoo complex for the beginner. The majority rated it to be a practical and empirical approach<br />\nto learning and memory concepts, but were<br />\nsuprised that they dealt mainly with learning in<br />\nrats. Some students found the text, co-authored<br />\nby the professor, to be tedious and outdated,<br />\nbut most felt that his lectures clarified the text<br />\nwell. The professor's sense of humor helped<br />\nmany a student through occasionally boring lecture topics.<br />\nWork outside the class consisted of 3-5 hours<br />\nof reading weekly, with the final grade depending upon a quiz and final. Students found both<br />\nthe work and two-credit allocation fair. Tests<br />\nwere \"relevant,\" and the high B curve helped<br />\nalleviate somewhat the competitive atmosphere.<br />\nStudents enthusiastically recommend this<br />\ncourse, noting that next year's course will be<br />\nparalelled by a lab course in which students<br />\nwill have an opportunity to work with animals<br />\nand people, demonstrating for themselves some<br />\nof the principles covered in reading and lecture.<br />\n(Note: this review covers the course \u2014 formerly<br />\n20.3 \u2014 as taught by Dr. Hulse.

One of the complaints<br />\nraised by the students, however, was the inadequacy of the text, but Dr. Torgerson has said it<br />\nwill be changed for next term. The majority of<br />\nthe students in the class were psychology majors and this course was a major requirement.<br />\nThe work required per week was roughly three<br />\nhours and was not too difficult, but Professor<br />\nTorgerson is planning on more homework assignments for next term.<br />\nThe responding students believed this course<br />\nwas informative and practical. In the words of<br />\none student, \"It showed how statistical methods could be applied to psychology and education far better than the too theoretical calculus.\" The grading of the -course was received as<br />\nfair. The tests consisted of three to four examinations, each having a one-hour closed book<br />\nportion and an open book portion which was<br />\ntake home. The grading was based on these<br />\ntests. Dr. Torgerson stated that there was no<br />\ncurve used in his course and ordinarily about<br />\none-half of the class receives A's or B's.<br />\n<br />\n20.32 DEVELOPMENTAL<br />\nPSYCHOLOGY<br />\nDr. Ainsworth<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n33<br />\n21<br />\n23<br />\n17<br />\n95<br />\n62<br />\n/95<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was rated a<br />\ngood introduction to psychology, a must for<br />\nprospective psych, majors. The readings were<br />\nfairly long, and the Piaget was universally regarded as tedious. The lectures were considered<br />\na good addition to the readings, but a big long<br />\n(95 min.).

They found Dr.<br />\nGarvey an excellent professor who was interested in his student, and always willing to help.<br />\nHowever, at times he was difficult to find outside of class. The requirements were one individual paper and presentation, one group paper,<br />\nand a small amount of general reading which<br />\nwas considered good. The students felt no problems with grading or competition. Although<br />\nthe respondents' majors were both in the natural sciences, they indicated that due to this<br />\ncourse and Dr. Garvey, they plan to take more<br />\npsychology courses.<br />\n<br />\n20.41 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nPHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY<br />\nDr. Olton<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n20<br />\n26<br />\n28<br />\n78<br />\n56/78<br />\n<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will explore<br />\nthe areas of physiological psychology where it<br />\nis possible to interrelate the organization of behavior with the integrative action of the<br />\nnervous system. The underlying assumption of<br />\nthe course is that man's psyche and his soma<br />\nare closely interrelated, so that understanding<br />\nthe organization of man's biological characteristics should help us understand his behavior, and<br />\nvice versa.<br />\nThe topics that will be covered include sensation, perception, motor coordination, learning,<br />\nmotivation, and cognitive processes. The course<br />\nis given for both \"S\" and \"N.<br />\n'credit since it<br />\ncombines both the psychological and the biological approaches to the study of behavior. No<br />\nprerequisites are necessary.<br />\nThere will be two hourly exams and a final,<br />\nwith the final contributing about 50% to the<br />\ncourse grade.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The course was enthusiastically recommended by all responding, with<br />\nthe catch that the work was demanding. Many<br />\ntook it as a first psych course, and were not at<br />\na disadvantage. The lectures were highly rated,<br />\nas well as the texts. The grading was strict but<br />\nfair.

The student responding<br />\nfound the tests overly subjective and lacking a<br />\ngood grade distribution. Dr. Preston notes that<br />\nthis is a specialized, theoretical course in<br />\npsycholinguistics so, while there are no formal<br />\nprerequisites, this should not be taken as a first<br />\ncourse in psychology. He also states his intention to cut the number of journal reading<br />\ns<br />\nfrom 25 to about 20.<br />\n<br />\nments on the papers didn't help in comprehension, but the papers were judged to be a good<br />\nlearning experience overall.

Thomdike, Ed., American Council on Education,<br />\n1971). Chapters there are \"The Nature of Measurement,\" by Lyle V. Jones; \"Reliability,\" by<br />\nJulian C.

Most students<br />\ncomplained, however, that he seemed to be unprepared for his lectures. Furthermore, the lectures tended to be delivered in a rambling manner and were not well-organized. Dr. Webb was,<br />\nhowever, receptive to student questions and<br />\nideas. (This review was taken from past material on other courses taught by Dr. Webb.)<br />\n<br />\n20.334 MORAL<br />\nDEVELOPMENT<br />\n<br />\nSOCIAL<br />\nRELATIONS<br />\n23.17 VIOLENCE IN<br />\nCONTEMPORARY SOCIETY<br />\nDr. MeDill<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\nEntwistle has been her up-to-date knowledge of<br />\nthe material and her clear (albeit at times somewhat disorganized) presentations.

Despite what most<br />\nstudents termed a boring start, the general response was excellent. Most students thought<br />\nthe course was informative and thoughtprovoking. The semester's work, which required<br />\nabout 3 hours a week, consisted of a seminar<br />\npresentation', a short research paper, and much<br />\nreading... Students did complain about the overuse of statistical information, but all were'<br />\npleased with McDill's presentations. \"The professor seemed interested in the subject matter;<br />\nextremely knowledgable, and was always willing<br />\nto answer and discuss questions. Almost all the<br />\nstudents recommended it to future freshmen.<br />\n<br />\n23.57 SOCIAL INTERACTION<br />\nDrs.

On the whole, student<br />\ns<br />\nfound this course fairly interesting, especia<br />\nlly<br />\nthe extensive reading that was required. The<br />\ngrade is decided entirely by a take-home<br />\nfinal,<br />\nwhich Dr. Gordon described as \"difficult.\" Students did complain of Dr. Gordon's lack of<br />\nobjectivity and the specificity of the lectures. \"He<br />\nwas interested, but mostly in his own ideas. He<br />\nanswered questions and all that but rambled<br />\naround the subject all semester,\" a student<br />\ncommented.

A substantial amount of reading is involved, and regular<br />\nattendance and participation in class discussions<br />\nare expected. A research paper (20-25 pages)<br />\nwill be required in lieu of a final exam.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hogan<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was well-liked<br />\nfor its informal and sometimes jovial classroom<br />\natmosphere and Dr. Hogan's personality and<br />\ncommanding knowledge of the subject matter.<br />\nLectures were judged to be the best part of the<br />\ncourse and essential for a good grade. The instructor's ability to lead discussions was commented upon although some felt he avoided answering good questions. Grading is based solely<br />\non two ten page papers which were Oven on<br />\nmoderately interesting topics and required a<br />\nconsiderable amount of work. Lack of corn-<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n5<br />\n7<br />\n4<br />\n1<br />\n21<br />\n14/21<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was well received by all students responding. The work<br />\nload was considered appropriate, and not overly<br />\ndifficult. It consisted mainly of articles from<br />\njournals, with no assigned text. The lectures<br />\nwere considered excellent and grading fair.<br />\nMost students recommended the course in general and Dr. Blass in particular.<br />\n<br />\n20.332 SOCIAL COGNITION<br />\nDr. DeSoto<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. DeSoto, although extremely knowledgeable in his field, is a very<br />\npoor teacher. 1-lis 'lectures are generally rambling, boring, and totally unorganized, and were<br />\nconsidered to be the worst part of the course.<br />\nHowever, Dr. DeSoto is an excellent discussion<br />\nleader and initiates and encourages student activity in class. The reading for the course involved three paperback books. These were generally ambiguous, complicated and unnecessarily difficult, but those students in the class truly<br />\ninterested in. the field of 'social psychology<br />\nthought them interesting and worth the effort.<br />\nA short paper was required; this was nothing<br />\nmore than a one or two page summary of a<br />\njournal article. The final exam, which consisted<br />\nof short essay questions, constituted the entire<br />\ngrade for the course; this practice was universally condemned. The grading, however, was very<br />\nfair, with most students receiving at least a B.<br />\nIn summary, any student considering this<br />\ncourse should realize Dr. DeSoto's limitations<br />\nas a lecturer and actually be interested in the<br />\nsubject matter.<br />\n(This is a reprintfrom a<br />\nprevious review of this professor and course.)<br />\n<br />\nSpring 1973<br />\n<br />\n22.303 PROBLEM DRAMA<br />\nDr. Arellano<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n15/2<br />\n<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This is Hopkins' only dra-1<br />\nma course, and its students only wish the0<br />\nwere more like it.

There were virtually no complaints about<br />\nthe course or its professor. \"Bob's extremely<br />\ninterested, very knowledgable, and very accessible,\" one student commented.

Of the three<br />\nconcerts held, two came off<br />\nbeautifully and one almost ended<br />\nin disaster. The Student Council<br />\nand the Junior Class (Flying<br />\nMonkey) sponsored concerts on<br />\nSaturday and Sunday afternoon<br />\nwith near perfect results. The<br />\nweather was beautiful, the crowds<br />\nwere large, the music was good and<br />\nabove all we received no<br />\ncomplaints because of noise. On<br />\nSunday evening the Chaplain's<br />\noffice sponsored a loud rock show.<br />\nA number of problems were<br />\ncreated; 1) the concert was never<br />\nadvertised to the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, yet Hopkins facilities<br />\nwere used. 2) The Dean of<br />\nStudent si Office, the Student<br />\nCouncil and even the Campus<br />\nPolice on duty that weekend were<br />\nnot informed of the concert. 3)<br />\nThe quad in front of Gilman Hall<br />\nwas left in one pile of trash and<br />\nbroken bottles after the Flying<br />\nMonkey Concert had left the quad<br />\nspotless in th- ..fternoon. Because<br />\nof the Chaplain's lack of<br />\nforethought in telling other people<br />\nof this concert he had to suffer<br />\nthrough many problems and the<br />\nscorn of many people.<br />\nThe Student Council has found<br />\nthrough many painful experiences<br />\nthat an outdoor night time rock<br />\nconcert cannot be run on this<br />\ncampus. Speaking to Dr. Wickwire<br />\nbefore the concert I told him that<br /><br />\nthe police would come to close the<br />\nconcert down within 45 minutes<br />\nafter it began and needless to say<br />\nthat prediction came painfully<br />\ntrue. I also told him that if he<br />\ndidn't have his people clean up the<br />\nquad it would never be cleaned and<br />\nagain the quad was a sea of broken<br />\nbottles and beer cans. The most<br />\nserious side of the whole evening<br />\nwere the complaints of loud noise<br />\ncoming from as far away as<br />\nGreenmount Ave. Complaints were<br />\nso serious that even Dr. Muller<br />\nreceived ten phone complaints and<br />\nDean Benton came on campus to<br />\nsee where the noise was coming<br />\nfrom.<br />\nA week ago, the Student<br />\nCouncil spent many thousands of<br />\ndollars in an Arts Festival to<br />\nincrease community relations and<br />\nthe Chaplain in one thoughtless<br />\nmove trys to undo all that :,vork<br />\nand possibly ruin future outdoor<br />\nconcerts. I'm not saying that the<br />\nChaplain shouldn't sponsor events,<br />\nbut the least he could do is<br />\ndo-ordinate them with other<br />\nstudent groups that have had<br />\nexperience in these matters. If he is<br />\nunwilling to work with these other<br />\ngroups then he should make some<br />\narrangements to see that the<br />\nuniversity and the people in it<br />\ndon't have to suffer the pains of<br />\ncommunity complaints and the<br />\ndefiling of the campus.<br />\nBob Murcko<br />\nStudent Council Rep.<br />\nClass of 1973<br /><br />\nCommittee on Un-American<br />\nActivities, or in the American<br />\nLegion Firing Line series.

JOHNSON<br />\nThe No. 1 ranked Johns<br />\nHopkins Blue Jays maintained<br />\ntheir undefeated record by<br />\nhandling the Brown Bruins<br />\nSaturday, 18-7. Playing at Brown<br />\nStadium for the first time, the<br />\nJays treated a crowd of 6,000 to<br />\na display of tight defense and<br />\nawesome scoring power.<br />\nHopkins started off quickly,<br />\nscoring within the first minute<br />\nwhen Franz Wittelsberger fed<br />\nJack Thomas for a midfield<br />\nbounceshot. The teams traded<br />\ngoals until late in the first period<br />\nwhen the Blue Jays exploded to<br />\nan 8-2 margein.<br />\nThe second period was<br />\ncharacterized by tough defense on<br />\nboth sides. The only score of the<br />\nperiod came on an extra-man<br />\nsituation after goalie Les<br />\nMatthews was called for tripping<br />\non a clear.<br />\nHopkins put the game out of<br />\nreach in the third quarter by<br /><br />\noutscoring the Bruins, 7-2. The<br />\nhighlight of the period was a<br />\nthree goal spurt within 50<br />\nseconds by crease attackman Don<br />\nKrohn.<br />\nCoach Bob Scott cleared the<br />\nbench .in the fourth quarter and<br />\nmidfielder Phil Calderome took<br />\nadvantage of the opportunity,<br />\nscoring the final two goals of the<br />\ngame.<br />\nBrown played a much better<br />\ngame than the 18-7 final<br />\nindicates. Thr Bruins were the<br />\nfirst team this year to win more<br />\nface-offs and to outshoot the<br />\nB.J.'s. During the first period an<br />\nalarming number of Brown<br />\nmidfield cutters were receiving<br />\nfeeds close to the crease. Only<br />\nMatthews' superb goaltending<br />\nand Brown's consistent<br />\ninaccuracy prevented any<br />\nslimmer margin. The close<br />\ndefense played a very strong<br />\ngame, though, proving that last<br />\nweek's performance against<br /><br />\nJqck Thomas nets first goal ofBrown game<br /><br />\nVirginia was a true indication of<br />\nthe unit's ability to stop<br />\nopposing attackmen. The<br />\nmidfield defense will have to<br />\nimprove, however, in order to<br />\nhold down teams with strong<br />\nmidfields, such as Maryland.<br />\nThe offense once again<br />\ndisplayed why the Blue Jays are<br />\nthe top-ranked team in ,the<br />\nnation. Krohn had a field day<br />\nwith 6 goals and one assist. Billy<br />\nNolan, who has recently been<br />\nsuffering a scoring slump. got<br />\nback on the right track with<br />\nthree tallies. The midfield line of<br />\nDave Slafkofski, Bill<br />\nMcCutcheon, and Mike Perez<br />\nadded a strong contribution of 5<br />\npoints. They worked impressively<br />\nas a unit, both on offense and on<br />\ndefense. Thomas, continuing his<br />\ndual role as an attackman and a<br />\nmidfielder, sand 2 goals and six<br />\nartistic assists.<br />\nThe game was hard played<br />\nthroughout, and Brown never<br />\ngave up. The rough play resulted<br />\nin late game injuries to the two<br />\nco-captains. Matthews came out<br />\nof the goal on a fast break and<br />\ngave the lead man a devastating<br />\ncheck to avert a sure goal. But in<br />\nthe process, he injured his right<br />\nshoulder. Jim Ferguson, who<br />\nkept Brown's top attackman<br />\nfrom scoring all game, reinjured<br />\nhis shoulder and had to leave the<br />\ngame. However, according to<br />\nTrainer Leroy Brandimore, both<br />\ninjuries are considered to be<br />\nminor, and the co-captains are<br />\nexpected to be ready for this<br />\nSaturday's encounter against<br />\nArm at West Point.<br /><br />\nACCELERATE<br /><br />\nENRICH<br /><br />\n4'<br />\n'N<br />\nf<br />\n,Sr<br /><br />\nKen Winegrad scores on extra-man play<br /><br />\nJ.

Primarily we hope to<br />\nhelp students choose the type of courses they want by providing them<br />\nmore information on the courses and their professors. Secondarily, we<br />\nhope to provide a medium of communication between students and faculty members in the hope that professors would take note of the student opinion (albeit somewhat subjective) of the effectiveness of their<br />\nteaching.<br />\nThe Course Guide this semester incorporates new reviews offirst semester courses and the latest professors' descriptions available. In order to<br />\nprovide the fullest possible coverage of course offerings, reviews of professors written from material on other courses taught by the same professor have been included. They are clearly marked as such. Additionally, some reprints of previous reviews of the same professor teaching the<br />\nsame course have been included. A new feature of the Course Guide this<br />\nsemester is the inclusion, (where information was available) of a breakdown by class of students in a course. We feel that this is of value not<br />\nonly in putting student reviews into perspective, but also in indicating<br />\nthe sorts of students one might encounter in an upcoming version of the<br />\ncourse. Please bear in mind that those distributions by class are liable to<br />\nchange in any semester. Finally, the Course Guide has resurected (also<br />\nwhere information was available) the policy of publishing questionnaire<br />\nresponse ratios. We were pleased with the results of not only the new<br />\nquestionnaires, but the new method of their distribution.<br />\nA note here may be made about the Student Council Teacher Evaluation (Teaval) program to whose computer punch card questionnaires<br />\nyou have already been subjected. The Course Guide firmly endorses such<br />\nnumerical analyses, but would like to point out that it and the Teaval<br />\nate either working at cross purposes nor duplicating effort. The Teaval<br />\nhas considerable importance as a tool for evaluating the quality of undergraduate teaching at Hopkins. The Course Guide aims more at providing on a semester to semester basis, the latest in professor's statements<br />\n- regarding a course and an already-digested analysis of student opinion of<br />\nprevious versions of the course.<br />\nFinally, the editors would like to express their gratitude to those who<br />\nhelped make this semester's Course Guide possible: the Hopkins NewsLetter for the use of their composition equipment and dark room facilities; the Registrar's office for all the information which they provided<br />\nus, the duplication department of Garland Hall for their assistance with<br />\ngeneral printing; and finally, all the professors who submitted statements<br />\nand allowed their students time in class to receive and complete questionaires.<br /><br />\nEditors<br />\nAssociate Editors<br />\nPhoto Editor<br />\nLayout Editor<br /><br />\nMark H Barth, John Broughton<br />\nJannette M Berg, Kenneth P Smith<br />\nMichael Bloch<br />\nBertha Polin<br /><br />\nstaff: Lloyd Berkowitz, C.

In this course, there is I lecture<br />\nper week with Dr. Berger or Dr. Hartman, 1<br />\nconference with a grad student, and 3 hours of<br />\nlaboratory per week. The student's grade is<br />\nbased upon a 2 hour final and the lab notebooks. The professors have attempted to keep<br />\nthroating to a minimum by establishing a set<br />\ngrade scale and not curving the course. In the<br />\nlabs, the students worked with bacteria and viruses in order to gain insight into the fundamental problems in biology. According to past<br />\nstudents, the lectures were at times overdetailed, tedious, and boring. The students felt<br />\nboth professors adequate lecturers although<br />\nthere were times when Dr. Hartman seemed to<br />\nbe talking to the wall rather than his students.<br />\nThe students last year, however, were full of<br />\npraise for the grad students and the laboratory<br />\nwork. They felt that the experiments were interesting and fun. Also, the graduate students<br />\nwere excellent in their presentation of experimental information and were deemed very fair<br />\nin the grading of the lab books. Thus, World of<br />\nMicrobes is a course designed for non-science<br />\nmajors who can still gain satisfaction from<br />\nworking in microbiology.<br /><br />\n2.5 FRESHMAN SEMINARS<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nAll Freshmen<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n16/16<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Seliger's freshman seminar was enthusiastically received by nearly all<br />\nrespondents. The only students who expressed<br />\nsome hesitation about the course were those<br />\nwho felt the course over their heads. However,<br />\nwith the only requirement being a ten-minute<br />\ntalk, one can glean from the lectures what one<br />\nis interested in. Many students commented on<br />\nthe scholarliness of Dr. Seliger and noted his<br />\nreal interest in the course.<br />\nThe only weaknesses noted by the students<br />\nwere in regard to the rather complicated<br />\n(though not excessively long) readings and the<br />\naccessibility of the professor. While some students seemed to be able to find Dr. Seliger,<br />\nmost reflected the sentiment expressed in various remarks: \"he did his best to fit us into his<br />\nschedule\" and \"the instructor was available for<br />\nquestioning in his office ... however, he was seldom in his office.\" Overall, students enthusiastically recommended the course.<br />\nThe professor's \"Organization of Course\"<br />\nmaterial noted that high school biology and<br />\nchemistry were the only prerequisites and that<br />\na seminar format would be used.<br /><br />\n2.307 CELLULAR AND<br />\nCOMPARITIVE BIOCHEMISTRY<br />\nDrs. Brand,Nason, &amp; Bessman<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nSpecial U G<br />\nFreshman<br /><br />\n3<br />\n1<br /><br />\nSpring 1973<br />\n3<br />\n68<br />\n19<br />\n17<br />\n.8<br />\n120<br />\n29/1 20<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: As usual, Biochem was<br />\nwell received by most of the respondents; only<br />\na couple of them panned the course. The text<br />\nwas rated from good to excellent, the workload<br />\nof two to five hours per week was considered<br />\nfair, and, in most cases, the credits were considered appropriate. Respondents also had a generally favorable rating for the lectures, although<br />\nthis depended on the lecturer.<br />\nTests were the most poorly received part of<br />\nthe course; many students complaining of the<br />\nexcessive detail necessary to do well, and the<br />\nsometimes subjective grading of the grad students in Biology. It is a measure of the course's<br />\nsuccess, however, that this, the weak point, was<br />\nstill well received by about half the respondents. The only other weak point was some of<br />\nthe lectures given by Dr. Nason, Brand, and<br />\nKundig. Even then, only a few students didn't<br />\nlike Dr. Nason, and a few found the accents of<br />\nDrs. Brand and Kundig difficult to understand.<br />\nIn general, after all the complaints, people<br />\nstill recommended Biochem. A course possible<br />\nto take for a grade; perhaps more prudent to<br />\ntake Pass/Fail.<br /><br />\n2.319 BIOLOGICAL CONCEPTS<br />\nDr. Edidin<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Biology, rich in particulars, is poor in theories. The course aims to present an exposition of the most powerful and<br />\nmost general theory of biology, evolution by<br />\nnatural selection.<br />\nLectures will introduce the range of animal<br />\nand plant forms now extant, and discuss approaches to classification of these forms. Then<br />\nwe will develop an evolutionary view of present<br />\norganisms and go on to examples of evolution<br />\nfrom the fossil record.<br />\nAt this point students should have a fair<br />\n\"classical\" perspective on evolution. From this<br />\npoint on we will attempt the \"modern\" genetic<br />\napproach to evolution--Mendel applied to populations. The result of all this will, hopefully, be<br />\na good solid general view of biology, one that<br />\nwill save people from losing their way in the<br />\ngreater details of more advanced courses.<br />\nWhile the course is intended primarily for biology and natural sciences majors, it presupposes no biology beyond high school. Hence it<br />\nmight also be taken by other students interested in general biology. However, if enrollment<br />\nbecomes very large 'students other than the majors may not be able to enroll.<br /><br />\nCHEMISTR Y<br />\nDepartment's Statenrnt: The aim of the Department of Chemistry is to furnish a quality chemistry background for our own majors and those<br />\ngraduates and undergraduates for whom chemistry is a cognate subject. All courses (except for<br />\nPhysical Chemistry for Non-chemistry Majors)<br />\nare designed for both majors and no-majors alike. Accordingly, although some of our chemistry courses are broad in scope, they are not<br />\ncourses designed for survey but are courses designed to provide the student with the necessary background for his future studies. Since the<br />\nlaboratory is an important aspect of chemistry,<br />\nmost of our courses have concurrent laboratories and a good deal of our efforts are devoted<br />\nto the laboratory instruction.<br /><br />\n3.1 INTRODUCTORY<br />\nCHEMISTRY<br />\nDrs. Gryder,<br />\nDoering &amp; Kokes<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br /><br />\n286<br />\n4<br /><br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n6<br />\n3<br />\n1<br />\n300<br />\n104/150<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: For all the incoming freshman pre-med throats at Hopkins, Dr. Gryder's<br />\nIntroductory Chemistry is their first exposure<br />\nto a science course and provides an excellent<br />\nbackground for further chemistry courses.<br />\nBased upon the responses of this year's freshmen, Dr. Gryder is doing an excellent job in<br />\nthe teaching of Introductory Chemistry. In the<br />\nlectures Dr. Gryder used the text as a<br />\nbackgropnd to the lecture material and he attempted to answer any question asked during<br />\nlecture. The work required is about 1 chapter<br />\nper week and 10-15 problems per chapter<br />\nwhich results in a workload of about 8-12<br />\nhours per week. In the course the grades were<br />\nbased upon 4 exams and a final. If the student<br />\nwas satisfied with his grade average in the<br />\ncourse, he did not have to take the final at the<br />\nend of the year. Due to the fact that Dr.<br />\nGryder allows the students to drop one test<br />\nand the preset curve, he has attempted to alleviate some pressure new freshman feel from<br />\ncompetition for grades from fellow students.<br />\nEven with his research and activities with the<br />\npre-meds at Hopkins, Dr. Gryder still finds time<br />\nto conduct 2 1-2 hour question and answer periods a week and he is still available for<br />\nindividual students at his office. In the case\u2014fl<br />\nan extremely low average on a test, Dr. Grydl.e<br />\nadds points to get a C+ curve. Based upon the<br />\nresponses of this year's freshmen, the only fault<br />\nof the course was the conferences. The conference leaders were said to be inadequately prepared to answer problems from the homework<br />\nand at times were dealing with topics which<br />\nhad no bearing upon the text and lectures.<br /><br />\n(<br />\n(<br /><br />\n3.28 INTRODUCTORY<br />\nORGANIC CHEMISTRY<br />\nFaculty<br /><br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n11<br />\n267<br />\n38<br />\n9<br />\n2<br />\n327<br />\n89/ 1 60<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: The course is required for<br />\nscience majors. But given this, most students<br />\nfound Dr. Posner interesting and informative.<br />\nThe grading in Dr. Posner's section was considered fair, but there was grumbling about the<br />\ndifferences between his section and Dr. Nickon's. Most students recommended the course<br />\n'by Posner, and wished he would teach the second semester. The work is \"throat determined.\"<br />\n(Note: Last year Drs. Posner and Nickon<br />\ntaught this course.)<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: In the past years at Johns<br />\nHopkins, Organic Chemistry has represented the<br />\nnemesis of the premed students. The course is<br />\nrequired by almost every medical school in the<br />\ncountry and it also happens to be one of the<br />\nhardest courses in the sciences. According to<br />\nthe responses of the students in 3.23 last semester, the course was not quite the disaster<br />\nanticipated. The switchover from the Corwin<br />\ntext to the Morrison and Boyd text which is<br />\nconcise and relatively clear, although detailed,<br />\nwas considered an improvement. Dr. Nickon<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nwas found to be a clear and informative lecturer. However, the workload is still one of the<br />\ntoughest on campus and requires about 15-20<br />\nhours of study time divided among 1-2 chapters<br />\nper week and about 15-20 problems per chapter. In the duration of the semester 3 exams<br />\nand 4 quizzes were required in addition to the<br />\nfinal. All the averages were scaled to a value of<br />\n70%. In the final compilation of the grade, Dr.<br />\nNickon failed to indicate what the curve would<br />\nbe or how well on the final a student had to<br />\ndo to get a certain grade. In the final grades<br />\nthe curve turned out to be very low and over<br />\nforty percent of the students ended up with a<br />\nC or lower. In order to cover the vast amount<br />\nof material, Dr. Nickon found it impossible to<br />\nanswer questions during the lecture and the student with problems had to go to his office or<br />\nto the grad students if he was not available. According to a consensus of students, the conferences were of poor quality and there was a<br />\ngreat discrepancy in the ability of the graduate<br />\nstudent leaders. The conferences were felt by<br />\nmost students as a place to take quizzes and<br />\nthen discuss the quiz or tests with little time<br />\nleft for problems. And for the stude<br />\n.nt with difficulty, the accessability of Dr. Nickon through<br />\nhis secretary or the graduate students was questionable. Thus, even with the change in textbooks students feel that more changes must be<br />\nmade for the majority of Hopkins premeds to<br />\nmaster the subject.<br /><br />\n3.301 PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY I<br />\nDr. Robinson<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduage<br />\nOther<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n0<br />\n5<br />\n19<br />\n38<br />\n9<br />\n7<br />\n78<br />\n25/78<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: In the past, Dr. Poland had<br />\ntaught this course for some years, and very successfully. The size of this year's Intro. Chem.<br />\ncourse evidently necessitated calling Dr. Poland<br />\nto teach a lecture se'ction there, and Dr. Robinson was called at the last minute to teach<br />\nP\u2014Chem. Unfortunately, it appeared to some<br />\nthat Dr. Robinson had had little time to prepare for this course.(He normally teaches spectroscopy.) The course was not received so well<br />\nas in previous years.<br />\nThere were many complaints about the lectures. Except for the grad students, many felt<br />\nDr. Robinson was lecturing above the heads of<br />\nthe class. Several students (about 25-30%) concluded that Dr. Robinson was not interested in<br />\nthe class. Others, however, attributed this to<br />\nthe late date at which Dr. Robinson was appointed to teach the course. Most students<br />\nfound him very interested and willing to help.<br />\nDr. Robinson was definitely not the only<br />\ncause of trouble in P\u2014Chem. One problem was<br />\nthe required texts, which were received, overall,<br />\nmore poorly than the lectures. Those who were<br />\nmore specific commented that Karplus &amp; Porter's book was good to excellent, while Kauzmann's books were poor to \"horrible\".<br />\nOther complaints included grading, which<br />\nwas done by a Chem. grad student, and which<br />\nwas regarded as fair mostly by seniors and<br />\ngrads, and unfair by the juniors and some<br />\nothers. Wherever the prof. did grade however,<br />\nthere were no complaints. Also, most found the<br />\nB-curve to be fair. Outside work was another<br />\nsource of complaints, with many people doing<br />\nbetween 5 and 10 hours per week. Several felt<br />\nthe course should be 4 credits. Finally, several<br />\nPeople found the math above their level. Respondents- recommended Advanced Calculus as<br />\nat least a corequisite.<br />\nAll in all, this course was no great success<br />\nthis last year, for a variety of reasons. Many<br />\ndid not recommend the prof. or the course. It<br /><br />\nseems as things went along, they got better,<br />\nhowever, and things should be improving next<br />\nyear. A good course to take Pass/Fail, and it<br />\nmay be prudent to sign up for Math 11.10 with<br />\nit.<br /><br />\n3.331 CHEMICAL<br />\nCRYSTALLOGRAPHY:<br />\nDr. Kistenmacher<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The basic aims of this<br />\ncourse are to present sufficient material to the<br />\nstudents to accomplish two goals:<br />\nA working<br />\nknowledge of how X-ray diffraction is useful to<br />\nchemists, geologists, biologists, etc. The main<br />\nsubgoal here being the process of structure determination by the techniques of X-ray diffraction.<br />\nAn elucidation of the experimental and<br />\nmathematical techniques necessary for analysis<br />\nof the diffraction results. Some time will also<br />\nbe spent on the assessment of the accuracy of<br />\nthe structural results -- a point of prime interest<br />\nto the \"nonpracticing\" crystallographer.<br />\nThe course itself will be informal and loosely<br />\nstructured. A short discussion (written or oral)<br />\nwill be requested on some structure determination of interest to the student. A minimum<br />\nnumber of exams, but a more extensive array<br />\nof homework will be given -- X-ray diffraction<br />\nis a pilictical science and often best illustrated<br />\nby worked examples.<br /><br />\n3.325 PHYSICAL ORGANIC<br />\nDr. Murr<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is taken primarily by grad students with a sprinkling of<br />\nsenior's, and as such is a course for only the dedicated. But those who are willing to put in<br />\nsome time will find this excellent course and<br />\nDr. Murr one of the best profs in the department. The texts are expensive and not used<br />\nmuch; most of the outside time is spent reading<br />\npapers. There is no other homework. Tests are<br />\nrigorous and perhaps too long but fairly curved.<br />\nSome might find that Dr. Murr spends a<br />\ndisproportionate amount of time on topics of<br />\nhis own interest.<br /><br />\nCLASSICS<br />\nDepartment'sStatenent: Our main goal is to offer<br />\nan introduction to Greek and Roman civilization. We beieve that various approaches should<br />\nbe combined in order to achieve a full understanding of these ancient civilizations.<br />\nThere is the linguistic approach. Our department offers Greek and Latin courses on different levels and courses in Indoeuropean linguistics.<br />\nThere is the literary approach. The great<br />\ntexts (Homer, the Greek lyric poets, Greek drama, Herodotus, Horace, Virgil, Ovid - to mention only a few) are read and discussed either<br />\nin the original or in English translation.<br />\nThere is the historical approach. Greek and<br />\nRoman history are a fascinating panorama<br />\nwhich is surveyed and interpreted in a cycle of<br />\ncourses. The ancient historians are studied and<br />\nevaluated.<br />\nFinally, there is the archaeological approach.<br />\nArchitecture, painting and sculpture are a superb part of the heritage of Greece and Rome,<br />\nand the introductory courses in these subjects<br />\nare traditionally among the most popular classes in this University.<br /><br />\n4.3 LATIN AND GREEK IN<br />\nCURRENT USE<br />\nDr. Poultney<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Well Hoppie your search<br />\nhas ended; you have landed upon the course to<br /><br />\nPage 3<br />\ntake. A - it's a gut, B - the staff apparently is<br />\ninteresting and C - the professor cares enough<br />\nto make his teaching effective. The biggest problem with the course is that Dr. Poultney<br />\nsticks exactly to the text.<br />\n(Note: This is a reprint from the Nov. 1971<br />\nCourse Guide.)<br /><br />\n4.17 INTERMEDIATE GREEK<br />\nDr. Young<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Intermediate (i.e. 2nd<br />\nyear) Greek, is intended for those fairly rare<br />\nstudents (Graduate or Undergraduate) who are<br />\ndesirous of learning ancient Greek. We usually<br />\nread The Defense of Socrates (\"Plato's Apology \"), some scenes from Aristophanes' Birds,<br />\nand quite a lot of the Iliad. We also often read<br />\nsamples of other poetry, both lyric and elegiac.<br /><br />\n4.303 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nCLASSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY<br />\nDr. Young<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a once-overlightly discussion (with illustrations) of the antiquities of the Greeks and the Romans, as well<br />\nas their predecessors, such as Minoan and<br />\nMycenaeans, and Etruscans. We consider their<br />\narchitecture, sculpture, pottery, painting and<br />\nminor arts. This course is designed to interest<br />\nthose who are curious about classical antiquity,<br />\nits history, its art, and its people and their habits.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The lectures were considered informal and interesting, and Dr. Young's<br />\nsense of humor was considered quite an asset<br />\nto the course. There was only one final examination and it was evaluated as quite fair. Only<br />\nclass time is required in this course.<br />\n(Note: This is a reprint from the Nov. 1971<br />\n(ourcP Guitip<br /><br />\n4.321 HISTORY OF<br />\nCLASSICAL GREECE<br />\n1)r. Bradley<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course covers<br />\nGreek history from the Bronze Age until the<br />\nPeloponnesian War. Emphasis will be placed on<br />\npolitical and constitutional developments. There<br />\nwill be two lectures a week (MT 2:00 PM),<br />\nwith an additional preceptorial (TBA) in which<br />\nreading assignments and lecture material can be<br />\ndiscussed. Readings will be assigned from Herodotus and Thucydides (in English) as well as<br />\nsecondary sources. Some written work will be<br />\nrequired.

Undergraduate courses recommended<br />\nfor majors are accessible to physical science students in the University.<br />\nFor students who are not majoring in the<br />\nphysical sciences, the Department offers a series<br />\nof one-semester courses in astronomy, the solid<br />\nearth, meteorology and oceanography. The general aim of these courses is to interest such students in some of the variety of phenomena encountered in the earth sciences, to give them an<br />\nappreciation of the kinds of questions involved<br />\nin scientific investigation, the reasons why scientists regard these questions as important and<br />\nthe ways of investigation used. The courses demand little or no previous technical background. Any number of them can be taken in<br />\nany order.<br />\nDr. Scott's course, the Astronomy of the<br />\nSolar System, is offered for non-majors each semester. A new course for non-majors,The Planet Earth, will be offered for the first time by<br />\nDr. Phillips in the Fall Semester, 1973.<br /><br />\n27.15 ASTRONOMY OF THE<br />\nSOLAR SYSTEM<br />\nDr. Scott<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n61/87<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is popular<br />\namong pre-meds and humanities students alike-in short with anyone who needs a few easy N<br />\ncredits. Student grades consist of daily quizzes<br />\n(1/3), 2 mid-terms (1/3), and a. final (1/3), all<br />\ngraded on an 80-87 B, 88-100A, etc. curve.with<br />\nopen notes and questions straight from them.<br />\nThe daily quizzes do make class attendance<br />\nmandatory, but that's the only time you need<br />\nspend on the course, since the text is supplemental. Students find Dr. Scott an interesting<br />\nlecturer but one who perhaps underestimates<br />\nthe intellectual capabilities of his students. Students also found him occasionally misinformed<br />\non some recent development in the field that<br />\nhe hasn't kept up with. This course is scheduled at a time suitable for just about anyone and<br />\nshould be considered by any student who doesn't mind a lack of intellectual stimulation for<br />\nhis money.<br /><br />\n27.17 THE ATMOSPHERE AND<br />\nOCEANS<br />\nDr. Benton<br />\nResponse Ratio<br /><br />\n21/72<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Benton is a fine lecturer--clearly the best part of the course. Students unanimously praised his ability to clearly<br />\nanswer questions and clarify points. Unfortunately Dr. Benton's other responsibilities make<br />\nhim unavailable outside of class and periodically necessary for a substitute to take over. The<br />\ngrade consists of two mid-terms and a final<br />\ngraded by grad students on a B curve. This is a<br />\nvery general course that should not be taken by<br />\nscience majors interested in approaching the<br />\nsubject in depth but should be considered by<br />\nothers looking for a straightforward, elementary<br />\ncourse with 3 N credits.<br /><br />\n27.301 CLASSICAL<br />\nMAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS<br />\nDr. Scott<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The only review available<br />\nfor this course consists of material taken from<br />\nDr. Scott's course, Astronomy of the Solar<br /><br />\nSystem, listed above. Dr. Scott appears to be<br />\nlimited in knowledge of material beyond his<br />\nfields of specialization, which will make a<br />\ncourse of his undersirable for those demanding<br />\ncomprehensive coverage of subject material and<br />\napplications. He does try hard and his grading<br />\npolicy is not rigorous.<br /><br />\nEDUCATION<br /><br />\n5.313 INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />\nSTUDY OF EDUCATION<br />\nDr. Walton<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course serves as an<br />\nintroductory course to the study of education.<br />\nAlthough it includes a consideration of the interdisciplinary study of the subject, stress is<br />\nplaced on the integrity and autonomy of the<br />\npedagogical context. Students should be prepared to make an effort to get at the essential<br />\nnature of formal education, its inevitabilities<br />\nand ossibilities, rather than to take an evasive<br />\nintellectual route that by-passes the school.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Walton is this course.<br />\nThe requirements for the semester are one<br />\nbook, Dr. Walton's, and one \"substantial\" paper, so you can do whatever you wish. But the<br />\nlectures, 2 per week, are collages of ideas and<br />\ndiscussion on just about anything. Dr. Walton<br />\nreally knows what he is talking about. The<br />\n\"sage\" can create a strong argument on the<br />\nspur of the moment and then lead a discussion<br />\nthat is informative and thought provoking--a<br />\nrarity. Even if you are not planning to go into<br />\neducation, this course is a good one to take, even if for no other reason than being able to say<br />\nthat you had a Walton course. The grading on<br />\nthe paper was fair with an apparent B curve;<br />\nbut it seems that in this course, the grade doesn't seem to matter. The experience does.<br />\n(This is a reprint from the Nov. 19 71 Course<br />\nGuide.)<br /><br />\nADMINISTRATION IN<br />\n'Ailf,RICAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS<br />\nDr. Walton<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course will have to<br />\nbe limited to ten juniors and seniors. It will involve assignments in the schools as well as seminar discussions and reports.<br /><br />\nELECTRICAL<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\nDepartment Statement: The name \"Electrical<br />\nEngineering\" does not adequately convey the<br />\ngenerality and scope of the content of the<br />\nmany introductory courses offered by the department. Although these beginning courses lay<br />\nthe foundation for more advanced work within<br />\nthe programs within electrical engineering, they<br />\nare of sufficient generality to be of interest and<br />\nvalue to students in many other disciplines as<br />\nwell. For instance, the new course on Models<br />\nand Simulation, introduced this year, has not<br />\nyet dealt with an electrical system -- yet many<br />\nof the fundamental notions involved in studying systems of all kinds have been studied. The<br />\nrevolution in experimental methodology and<br />\nmeasurement being brought about by modern<br />\nintegrated circuits (which now offer a complete<br />\ndigital computer on a tiny chip of silicon at little cost) requires that these techniques be common knowledge to anyone working in science<br />\nor engineering.<br />\nWith the help of a $100,000 grant by the<br />\nWestinghouse Educational Foundation specifically for development of its undergraduate program, the Electrical Engineering Department is<br />\nexpanding its offerings of introductory courses<br />\nof interest to students in other departments.<br />\nThe Westinghouse grant (the first of its kind<br />\nmade by that corporation) will provide facilities<br />\nand laboratory resources needed to study the<br />\nlatest techniques for measuring and sensing data, such as that needed for environmental monitoring. Furthermore, the grant will provide for<br />\nexpansion of the department's PDP-11&amp;45<br />\ncomputer system to 12 time-shared terminals<br /><br />\nSpring 1973<br />\nby August 1973. Six of these terminals are<br />\nplanned for instructional use in connection<br />\nwith many of the courses offered by the department described below.<br /><br />\n52.17 MODELS AND<br />\nSIMULATION<br />\nDr. Huggins<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n16<br />\n18<br />\n13<br />\n12<br />\n2<br />\n51<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course emphasizes<br />\nthe formulation and representation of system<br />\nmodels using ideas that are generally applicable<br />\nto many disciplines today. A major them is<br />\nthat \"simulation is thinking made public.\" This<br />\ntechnique offers important opportunities for<br />\ngiving concise public expression to the consequences of our quantitative knowledge about<br />\nbiological, economic, environmental, and engineering systems.<br />\nThe course ties'Keller's Personalized Instructional Metlidd with e'mphasis on self-paced study by each student, with individual assistance<br />\nfrom tutors and instructors, rather than on formal leciures' as 'the'.

The number of units completed<br />\nlargely determines the grade in the course.<br />\nThe course may be taken by freshmen who<br />\nare familiar with algebra although some familiarity with the calculus will be helpful.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Models and Simulation is<br />\ngiven in self teaching units,' with a student who<br />\ntook the course before 8s'a proctor. The professor gives only a few lectures. There was a<br />\ntest for each unit completed -- about 9 or 10<br />\nfor the semester comprising 75% of the grade.<br />\nThe final exam covered the other 25%. Reactions by the fifty or so taking the course to this<br />\nsystem went from \"gear to very poor and<br />\n\"worthless.\" Most considered the grading fair,<br />\nbut thought that a little too much work had to<br />\nbe put into the course. Most also thought the<br />\ncourse to be a little too theoretical and not<br />\npractical enough, especially the E.E. majors because electronics is almost avoided. Most students on the whole considerodit a' good course<br />\nbut felt a 'background in catculus and some in<br />\nelectricityis,needed before,taking it.<br /><br />\n52.49 INttGATED CIRCUITS<br />\nAND.

The course is<br />\ngraded entirely upon the lab reports, and grading is extremely fair and generous. The texts<br />\nfor the course are fairly good, and Dr. Westgate's lectures cover all the material that you<br />\nneed to know. The amount of work required<br />\nwas termed just right.

In short, we<br />\nwill use mathematics to study in greater depth<br />\nthe kinds of models that are treated in EE<br />\n17-18, Models and Simulation. We will also use<br />\nthe PDP-11 computer, but more as an aid to<br />\nanalytical approaches than as a simulation tool.<br />\nPrerequisites are 2.17-18, 11.10-11, and<br />\n52.33-34 or further mathematical maturity.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Students were not ecstatic<br />\nwith this course, but all were satisfied with it.<br />\nThere was no text for this course, though several books on control and systems theory were<br />\non reserve in Hutzler and page references were<br />\ngiven in the lectures for those who needed<br />\nthem. The grade was based on the best 3 of<br />\nfour hourlies and marginally on the weekly<br />\nhomework problems. Dr. Rugh was a reasonable lecturer, few had difficulty following his<br />\npresentations and he handled questions well.<br />\nThe material had little immediate practical application, but considering its introductory nature, this was not a subject for complaint. This<br />\ncourse is recommended to E.E. majors and<br />\nothers interested in systems theory.<br /><br />\nENGLISH<br />\n6.51 SHAKESPEARE:<br />\nCOMEDIES AND ROMANCES<br />\nDr. Stein<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course, 6.51, will<br />\ncenter as much as possible on the plays<br />\nthemselves and try to consider such matters as<br />\nthe particular distinctness of each play as work<br />\nof art, as comment of human experience, the<br />\nrelationship with other plays of Shakespeare's,<br />\nwith concepts of comedy (old and new), with<br />\nRenaissance thought, with modem thought.<br />\nThe whole class will meet for two lecturediscussions a week and divide into small groups<br />\nfor a third meeting.<br /><br />\n6.301 CHAUCER: SONGS,<br />\nDREAM\u2014VISIONS,TROILUS &amp;<br />\nDr. Howard<br />\nCRISEDE<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a two-semester<br />\ncourse covering all the major works of Geoffrey<br />\nChaucer. The works will be assigned in the order in which Chaucer wrote them and will be<br />\nread in Middle English. The text is A. C.<br />\nBaugh, Chaucer's Major Poetry. The course will<br />\ntry to teach the student to read Chaucer's English, interpret his poems against the background of his age, and understand why he is<br />\none of the greatest writers of all time.<br />\nThe course will be taught by some combination of lectures, readings from the text, and<br />\ndiscussion. There will be at least one paper,<br />\nsome quizzes, probably an exam,--these depending on the size and character of the class. Some<br />\ncollateral readings will be recommended, a reserve shelf will be set up in the library, tapes of<br />\nMiddle English will be available ir..the language<br /><br />\nlaboratory, and some slides of contemporary<br />\nmanuscript drawings will be shown.<br />\nThe first semester will treat some of the<br />\nshorter poems, The Book of the Duchess, The<br />\nHouse of Fame, The Parliament of Fowles, and<br />\nTroilus and Criseyde.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Professor Howard is regarded as \"excellent\" by an overwhelming proportion of his students. Lectures are interesting,<br />\n\"worthwhile\", and -stimulating, and discussion<br />\nusually results. However, his courses are not<br />\neasy: the work is considerable, and exams are<br />\nfair but rigorous.<br /><br />\n. 6.303 ELEMENTARY ANGLO<br />\nSAXON<br />\nDr. Irwin<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Irwin is generally rated as<br />\ngood by most of his students. He is extremely<br />\nknowledgible, interesting, and interested, as<br />\nwell, always willing to talk with students. His<br />\nlectures are regarded favorably, except for his<br />\nfrequent digressions from the topic.<br /><br />\nGEOGRAPHY<br />\nAND<br />\nENVIRONMENTAL<br />\nENGINEERING<br />\nDepartment Statement: Students and faculty in<br />\nthe Dept. of Geography and Environmental Engineering are interested in how nature works,<br />\nhow society works, and the ways in which .engineering can help to match the desires of society with the workings of the natural world.<br />\nBecause engineering design and public decision<br />\nmaking must rest upon a sound knowledge of<br />\nhow things work, study of the environment involves both the sciences and the arts. Because<br />\nthe department is concerned with the interrelationship between the natural and social sciences<br />\nand engineering, students from many fields are<br />\nencouraged to enroll in the courses offered. A<br />\nnew course will be offered under the auspices<br />\nof this department by members of the Dept. of<br />\nEpidemiology of the School of Hygiene and<br />\nPublic Health. This course is entitled<br />\n\"Environmental determanants of Human Diseas.\" It will be at the 300 level and should be<br />\nof interest to many students ranging from premeds to social scientists.<br /><br />\n38.2 MAN AND ENVIRONMENT<br />\nDr. Wolman<br /><br />\nClass Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n14<br />\n7<br />\n12<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n36<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course has no text,<br />\nbut required outside readings that were generally well accepted. Dr. Wolman's lectures enlarged on the material in these readings, the exams covering both lectures and readings with an<br />\nemphasis on the lecture material. There was<br />\none hourly, a final, one term paper, and two<br />\nfive page papers. Not requiring an unreasonable<br />\namount of work for the credit, this course is<br />\nrecommended to anyone interested in the environment.<br /><br />\n38.11 HOUSING IN BALTIMORE<br />\nDr. Harvey<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Harvey has been quite<br />\nwell received by students who have taken his<br />\ncourses. Comments included occasions that Dr.<br />\nHarvey \"made\" the course and that his teaching a course was sufficient reason to take it.<br />\nApparently Dr. Harvey tends toward philosophical discussions, long recommended reading<br />\nlists and is rated as very accessible.<br />\n(This is a reprint from the Nov. 1971 Course<br />\nGuide.)<br /><br />\n38.329 CHEMISTRY AND<br />\nPHYSICS OF WATER<br />\nDr. Gavis<br />\nPOLLUTION<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Gavis, while meticulously organized, has been criticized in the past<br />\nfor assuming too much previous knowledge on<br />\nthe part of the students and speaking a little<br />\ntoo quickly in his lectures. He has, however,<br />\nbeen considered fair and accessible.<br />\n(This review is written from material on another course taught by Dr. Gavis.)<br /><br />\n38.385 READING MARX'S<br />\nCAPITAL<br />\nDr. Harvey<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Marx's Capital is a difficult and intimidating work to tackle on your<br />\nown. I want to set up a course that will help<br />\nthose who are interested or curious about its<br />\ncontent and meaning, to find a way through it<br />\nthat overcomes some of the difficulties. I will<br />\nnot pretend that the work will be easy for a<br />\ndeep and challenging work cannot be interpreted simply or glibly. So the aim of the course<br />\nis to help you to read it. We will not read all<br />\nof it. I aim to select a way through Volume 1<br />\n(concentrating on certain key sections) to skim<br />\nVolume II, and to return to a more detailed examination of the content of the first half of<br />\nVolume III. My role as a teacher is to act as a<br />\nguide. Your role as student i to explore. There<br />\nwill be no tests or examinations. But I do expect the reading to be done and I also expedt<br />\npeople to attend the class sessions. There will<br />\nbe one two hour session at which attendance is<br />\nexpected and a one hour session which will be<br />\nopen to use (or non-use) as we see fit as a class<br />\n(to consolidate ideas, to explore implications,<br />\nor to clear up particularly contentious points).<br />\nI would emphasize that the aim of the course is<br />\nto discover what it is that Marx has to say.<br />\nMany people think they know what Marx has<br />\nto say (without ever having read him). If you<br />\nread Capital you may be surprised.<br /><br />\n,411<br /><br />\nPage 6<br /><br />\nSpring 1973<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br /><br />\nGERMAN<br />\n9.1 ELEMENTARY GERMAN<br />\nDr. Friesen and Staff<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n82<br />\n19<br />\n12<br />\n5<br />\n2<br />\n121<br />\n63/1 21<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course covers the<br />\nbasic principles of German pronunciation, grammar and syntax. The thorough study of the<br />\ncompact German for Beginners is coupled early<br />\nin the first semester with graded readings from<br />\nVorboten der Gegenwart (about Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Einstein) and Die Deutschen und<br />\ndie Osterreicher (about 20th-century German<br />\nhistory.) The cultural contest of these books is<br />\nsupplemented in the second semester with literary selections by modern authors from Literature fur den Deutschunterricht II as well as mimeographed material.<br />\nAs far as the scheduled readings permit, a<br />\nminimum of oral (class work is devoted to<br />\npronunciation practice and grammatical patterns. In order to earn the extra half credit allotted students are expected to attend the Language Laboratory regularly(/<br />\n1<br />\n2 hour per week).<br />\nThis year the course has an enrollment of over<br />\n120 students and is taught by six instructors<br />\nand myself, under my coordination. A common<br />\nsyllabus ensures uniformity in instruction,<br />\nassignments, and grading. The semester grade is<br />\na composite of achievements in class work,<br />\nquizzes, hourly examinations, and homework.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: For those Hopkins throats<br />\nwith an aversion to sleeping later than 7:00<br />\nA.M., Dr. Friesan's Elementary German appears<br />\nto be an excellent introductory course to German which upper division students could enjoy<br />\nin addition to freshman. The 31<br />\n/<br />\n2 credits of the<br />\ncourse cover 3 1 hour lecture periods plus a<br />\nminimum of one half hour that each student is<br />\nexpected to spend in the infamous language lab<br />\neach week. For the grade, the student is evaluated by 3 one hour exams, quizzes, homework,<br />\nand classwork. Due to a pre-set grade scale of<br />\nDr. Friesan, competition is kept at a minimum,<br />\nand past students felt that with a reasonable<br />\namount of work (about 5-10 hours per week)<br />\none should get at least a B if not an A. In additi.on, most students were very praiseworthy of<br />\nDr. Friesan and stated he was knowledgeable<br />\nand readily answered questions. The class time<br />\nwas primarily used to discuss grammar and to<br />\ntranslate difficult protions in the reading. However, the major emphasis is upon reading German and almost all discussion in class is in \"English.\" Perhaps, Dr. Friesan will attempt to integrate more German conversation into 9.1, if<br />\nnot, one will have to take German Conversation<br />\n9.5 in addition to the Elementary German 9.1.<br /><br />\n9.3 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN<br />\nDr. Allen and Staff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The basic second-year<br />\nGerman course intended to develop skills in<br />\nreading and comprehension. The first semester<br />\nincludes a thorough review of grammar with interspersed reading assignments of increasing difficulty. The second semester will continue the<br />\nreadings (using texts from the areas of modern<br />\nfiction and drama.) Some \"sight reading\" practice will be done also with newspaper articles<br />\nand other texts of interest to the students of a<br />\ngiven section. Grades are determined on the basis of shorter quizzes, longer departmental<br />\nhourlies, written assignments, Class work (pre, ,<br /><br />\nparation, response, participation), and a final.<br />\nNo laboratory work is required for the course,<br />\nalthough a student may, at his or her option,<br />\nelect to do lab work for an extra /<br />\n1<br />\n2 hour of<br />\ncredit. Some oral German will be used in class<br />\nby the instructors.

Students are encouraged to indicate to their instructors specific linguistic difficulties and topics they would like to discuss in German. Although the greatest emphasis is placed on oral<br />\nclass participation!, there is a modicum of short<br />\nwritten homework assignments.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: In the language departments at Hopkins the major orientation of the<br />\ncourses is toward the reading of the language<br />\nand an exploration of the native literature. For<br />\nlanguage majors or students entering technical<br />\nfields, this could prove to be quite useful. But<br />\na large number of students do not: need such<br />\nan extensive background in reading skills and<br />\nwould prefer to concentrate on conversation<br />\nperhaps to be used on a future student trip to<br />\nEurope. For this type of student, German Conversation, which was taught by Barbara Paul last<br />\nsemester, is the answer. The course requires 2<br />\n1-hour classes per wek and students averaged<br />\n3-7 hours per week of outside study. The<br />\ncourse was small and informal with 5 students<br />\nin it last semester. The major emphasis is German conversation with grammar and literature<br />\nintegrated into the course where useful. There<br />\nwas a total lack of Hopkins grade pressure associated with the course and the grade was almost entirely based upon oral presentation. Tte<br />\nstudents were effusive in their praise of Barbara<br />\nPaul in regard to the quality of her teaching.<br />\nShe readily fielded questions in class and was<br />\navailable for outside consultation. Dr. Friesan<br />\ncould take some lessons on how to improve his<br />\nelementary German course from this course by<br />\nintroducing conversation on that level in conjunction with the literature, rather than forcing<br />\nstudents to take an additional course in his department to pick up the conversation.<br /><br />\n9.7 INTERMEDIATE GERMAN<br />\nCONVERSATION AND COMPOSITION<br />\nDr. Allen and Staff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The course is intended<br />\nto develop skills in speaking and writing German at a level considerably beyond just routine<br />\ncommunication. Oral activities will include<br />\ntalks, discussions, debates, linguistic \"games\"<br />\nrole-playing, situation dramas, etc. The written<br />\nassignments will include dialogues, letters, essays, translations, poetry, simple fiction, etc.<br />\nFollowing a brief grammatical review at the beginning of the first semester, the course will unfold organizationally concentrating on correcting<br />\nthose deficiencies in pronunciation, style, and<br />\nvocabulary that show up in the performance of<br />\nthe students. The instructions will strive to<br />\nmaintain an informal atmosphere in which creative. participation can flourish. Except for vo,<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ncabulary and stylistic reference works, no text<br />\nbooks will be used. Weekly laboratory work is<br />\nrequired (for an extra /<br />\n1<br />\n2 hour credit). Grades<br />\nare based on progress in pronunciation and fluency, quizzes, exams, and written assignments.<br />\nPrerequisite: German 1-2 or the equivalent plus<br />\nsome experience in oral work. For information<br />\nsee Richard Allen, 244 Gilman Hall.<br /><br />\n9.9 SCIENTIFIC GERMAN<br />\nDr. Friesen and Staff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This weekly meeting allows students with no previous knowledge of<br />\nGerman to familiarize themselves with the typical syntactic patterns and standard vocabulary<br />\nin a variety of scientific fields treated in Straubinger's revised Elementary German Science<br />\nReader.<br /><br />\nSub..<br />\n406<br /><br />\n9.11 MODERN GERMAN<br />\nSHORT FICTION<br />\nDr. Kurth and Staff<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n3<br />\n4<br />\n14<br />\n12/14<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: Modem German Short<br />\nFiction is designed to serve two functions: the<br />\nstudy of the German language is continued on<br />\nthe intermediate level with emphasis on reading<br />\nword studies; the reading selections are also<br />\ntreated as literature. Artistic aspects, e.g., structure, style, and narrative techniques, as well as<br />\ntopics and themes, will be discussed.<br />\nStories by Kafka, Hesse, Mann, Brecht, and<br />\nBoll will be read. Kafka's Verwandlung will be<br />\nincluded during the first semester and Gunter<br />\nGrass' Katz und Maus will be read during the<br />\nsecond semester. Students may consult the<br />\ntranslations of the two larger works.<br />\nThree hourly examinations will be given during each semester.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: For the student with one<br />\nyear of college level German or 2 years of high<br />\nschool German, Modern German Short Fiction<br />\nrepresents an excellent course for continuing in<br />\nthe German language. The course used<br />\nMeisterzahugen, an anthology of German short<br />\nstories of varying difficulty. Three hourly exams are given over the course of the semester<br />\nand a final is added. There is no competition<br />\nfor grades since a set scale has been established<br />\nof 91-100% A, 81-90% B, etc. According to the<br />\nstudents, an average of 10-15 hours was spent<br />\noutside class reading and translating German<br />\nshort stories. The class time was spent on in<br />\ndepth discussions including some work on vocabulary encountered in the text. The students<br />\nfelt Karen Kapp was an excellent instructor in<br />\nthat she was well versed in the literature and<br />\nreadily available to answer questions. However,<br />\nthe major criticism of some courses in the German department appears again. The students<br />\nfelt it pointless to read and translate the text in<br />\norder to come to class and carry on discussions<br />\nin English rather than in German. It is probably<br />\ntime for Dr. Friesan to modify his courses and<br />\nintroduce German conversation into all language courses in his department.<br /><br />\nPage 7<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br /><br />\n9.13 SCIENTIFIC GERMAN II<br />\nDr. Homan<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Primarily a reading<br />\ncourse, Scientific German II is designed to familiarized the participants with the characteristic<br />\nsyntactical difficulties and peculiarities as well<br />\nas the terminology of German scientific texts.<br />\nThe reading material consists of original German contributions to the fields of Mathematics,<br />\nPhysics, Chemistry, Radiology, and Biology<br />\nfrom the 17th through the 20th centuries, written by such noted scholars as Leonard Euler,<br />\nGregor Mendel, Robert Koch, Wilhelm Rontgen, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud and<br />\nothers.<br />\nGrades will depend on class participation and<br />\nperformance in two hourly exams and a number of quizzes.<br /><br />\n9.17 ADVANCED GERMAN<br />\nCONVERSATION AND<br />\nDr. Friesen<br />\nCOMPOSITION<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n4<br />\n6<br />\n3<br />\n2<br />\n15<br />\n11/15<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: A study of some of the<br />\nsubtler but crucial principles of German grammar, idiomatic pharaseology, word formation,<br />\nand stylistic levels of writing. The emphasis is<br />\nplaced upon oral class participation, and the<br />\nchoice of subject matter is adapted to individual interests. A minimum of written composition<br />\nassignments attempts to adhere to reasonably<br />\npragmatic criteria, avoiding esoteric topics. The<br />\nKleines Aufsatzbuch by Lederer and Neuse<br />\nserves as a point of departure for classroom discussions regarding the characteristic details of<br />\npast and present life in Germany.<br />\nStudent Evaluaion: Students of German with a<br />\nknowledge above the intermediate level generally found this course extremely worthwhile.<br />\nLauding Dr. Friesen as a \"capable,\" \"enthusiastic,\" \"talented,\" and \"sincerely interested\".professor, most felt the course was well organized.<br />\nSeveral students, however, felt there was too<br />\nmuch emphasis on composition and grammar,<br />\nrather than on conversation. Similarly, although<br />\nthe readings were generally well-regarded, a few<br />\nexpressed the feeling that they were difficult<br />\nand demanding of a great deal of time. These<br />\nsame students tended to feel the course should<br />\nbe three rather than two credits. The amount<br />\nof time needed varied according to past experience with the language. The average time required was three hours a week. Grading was<br />\njudged very fair with a bit of apprehension by<br />\nsome, because they had no real idea of what<br />\ntheir semester grade would be as it was<br />\nessentially determined by class participation<br />\nand an oral final exam. For those with a background of German above the intermediate level<br />\nand a desire to sharpen the language skills, the<br />\ncourse is well-recommended especially under<br />\nthe fine instruction of Dr. Friesen.<br /><br />\n9.355 GERMAN LITERATURE<br />\nIN THE AGE OF GOETHE<br />\nDr. McClain<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course has no formal prerequisites. It is designed for the student<br />\nwho wishes to become acquainted with some of<br />\nthe major works written during Goethe's lifetime, that is, between 1750 and 1830. This period comprehends the movements known as<br />\n\"Storm and Stress,\" \"Classicism\" and \"Romanticism.\" The works are read in English, but if<br />\nsufficient students wish it, an additional section<br />\nfor extra credit will be formed in which some<br />\nshorter works will be read in German. The<br />\ncourse meets twice weekly. Lectures outline<br />\nmajor lines of development, but the emphasis is<br />\non close reading of texts, which are,discussed<br />\nby the group as a whole. The hour examination<br /><br />\nand final examination consist of questions of a<br />\nliterary-historical nature. There is a substantial<br />\namount of reading, but it is or moderate difficulty. The course should be valuable to students majoring in comparative literature, international relations, history or the history of art.<br />\nBecause of the close connections between England and Germany at that time it should also<br />\nbe of interest to concentrators in English. Enrollment is limited to 35.<br /><br />\n10.9 HISTORY OF UNITED<br />\nDr. Walters<br />\nSTATES<br /><br />\nCourse bistribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n9.375 MODERN GERMAN<br />\nDRAMA<br />\nDr. Allen<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Study of a select number of plays from Lenz (late 18th century) to<br />\nBrecht, supplemented by critical writings of<br />\nhigh literary caliber. Emphasis on close textual<br />\nanalysis, interpretive problems, and historical<br />\nperspective. Texts in German. Required<br />\nindependent outside readings in English if the<br />\nstudent so desires. Lectures and discussions in<br />\nEnglish. Prerequisite German 3-4 or 11-12 (or<br />\nthe equivalent). Grades will be based on two<br />\n\"thought\" papers or (at the student's option)<br />\non one thought paper and a written final examination.<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: 10.9, the first half of a<br />\nfull-year survey course in American history,<br />\nprovides a good background in the subject for<br />\nthose incidentally interested in it and an equally valuable launching point for students planning to delve further into the field. Dr. Walters<br />\nwas commended almost unanimously for his<br />\nstimulating lectures and willingness to answer<br />\nquestions. Conference sections elicited the usual<br />\ninvective-, charges of irrelevance, bad co-ordination with lectures, arbitrary grading, failure of<br />\ngrad students to comment on graded papers what one comes to take for granted in introductory survey courses at Hopkins. The work<br />\nload consisted of about 150 pages a week and<br />\nten pages of written work throughout the term;<br />\nnothing immoderate there. In all, it's worth going through the Micky Mouse of the conference<br />\nsections to take Dr. Walters' course. The dues<br />\nto be paid for enlightenment are lighter here<br />\nthan in most academic offerings on campus.<br /><br />\nHIS<br />\nDepartment Statement: In the past year the<br />\nDepartment of History has introduced a number of new types of courses for the benefit of<br />\nHopkins' students generally as well as for departmental majors. The Pro-seminars are designed to provide opportunities for studies in<br />\ndepth in particular topics, while the \"Basic<br />\nConditions of Life in Historical Perspective\"<br />\ntakes a more sweeping approach to selected<br />\ntopics of European social history. Non-majors<br />\nare encouraged to enroll in the Pro-seminars,<br />\nthough prior consultation with the professor is<br />\nstrongly advised. New introductory courses in<br />\nthe histories of Latin American and Africa have<br />\nalso been added to the offerings which are especially designed for freshmen and sophomores.<br />\nOn the advanced level (300 courses) innovation<br />\nis a normal dimension of \"Colloquium\" courses,<br />\nso students are well advised to learn about the<br />\ncontents of these courses before enrolling.<br /><br />\n10.14 HISTORY OF LATIN<br />\nAMERICA<br />\nDr. Russell\u2014Wood<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n10.3 HISTORY OF OCCIDENTAL \"<br />\nCIVILIZATION 1650 TO PRESENT<br />\nDr. Forster<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This survey course emphasizes the social history from 1650-1848. The<br />\nperiods approached through major issues of<br />\nthe time rather than through chronological development. This created some problems for certain students because the emphasis of the<br />\ncourse was not on historical events and a limited knowledge of historical facts of the period<br />\nwas assumed.<br />\nWork load was moderately heavy (average<br />\nabout 5 hours a week). Requirements were<br />\nreading about a book a week, three 5 page papers and a final. While some of the individual<br />\nreading selections were criticized, on the whole<br />\nthey were considered good and worthwhile.<br />\nDr. Forster was probably the best aspect of<br />\nthe course. He is definitely knowledgeable and<br />\nvery interested in teaching. Comments such as<br />\n\"enthusiastic\" and \"excellent\" were recurrent.<br />\nThe lectures were generally interesting and<br />\nwell-presented. Students found the outline on<br />\nthe board a great help. There was some<br />\ncriticism that Dr. Forster rarely completed this<br />\noutline. The result was rushing to complete the<br />\nlecture at the end of the hour and lectures frequently ran overtime.<br />\nGrading varied with each converence leader<br />\nbut was generally considered fair. Conferences<br />\non the whole were thought to be helpful.<br />\nOverall, this course was considered very good<br />\nand worth the work. It was highly recommended, especially for those interested in\u2022French history wich is Dr. Forster's field.<br /><br />\n28<br />\n29<br />\n20<br />\n13<br />\n90<br />\n5/90<br /><br />\n1<br />\n1<br />\n5<br />\n6<br />\n1<br />\n14<br />\n5/14<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statment: The objective of the<br />\ncourse is to create in the students an awareness<br />\nof contributions in the cultural , social and<br />\neconomic areas made by the peoples south of<br />\nthe Rio Grande in the Pre-Columbian, Spanish,<br />\nand Portuguese colonial periods. Students will<br />\nbe encouraged to replace the traditional Eurocentric approach to history by a Latin American perspective. Comparisons will be drawn to<br />\nNoith American, African and Asiatic situations<br />\nwhere appropriate and to present-day cultural<br />\nand social circumstances in these areas.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: While labeled an introductory course, 10.14 requires students to do considerable reading and sophisticated essaywriting. Covering an area unfamiliar to most<br />\nHopkins students in a lively, erudite, humorous<br />\nmanner, Dr. Russell \u2014Wood has won the reputation of \"quite a character\" and his course is<br />\nconsidered a novel experience. Writing six essays involving research skills not usually mastered by novices beforehand is a task rather intimidating to under-classmen and this \"introductory course,\" in practice attracts the 300level crowd. Even so, A's are a scarce commodity here, so taking this course on a pass/fail basis would be advisable. Venturesome underclassmen and non-history majors will be rewarded<br />\nby experiencing a subject and professor anything but run-of-the-mill. Enthusiastically recommended.<br /><br />\n10.17 AFRICA: AN<br />\nINTRODUCTION TO ITS PEOPLES<br />\n&amp; HISTORY<br />\nDr. Cohen<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br /><br />\nPage 8<br /><br />\nSpring 1973<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br /><br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n8<br />\n7<br />\n5<br />\n24<br />\n6/24<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: A cross-disciplinary introduction to African history and culture, 10.17<br />\nwas generally well-received by its students. Dr.<br />\nCohen's lectures were described as interesting<br />\nand full of concepts and approaches unfamiliar<br />\nto those previously encountered by most Hopkins students. He was approachable and<br />\nreceptive to students' ideas. Grading was based<br />\non two open-book take-home exams. Two lectures a week; no conference sections. Required<br />\nreading was fairly heavy.<br /><br />\n10.95 UNDERGRADUATE<br />\nSEMINAR IN HISTORY<br />\nDr. Spring<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course is open only<br />\nto undergraduate majors in history. During the<br />\nfirst term students will be introduced to elementary aspects of writing history (including<br />\ndoing research) and thinking about its nature as<br />\nan intellectual discipline. Emphasis will be put<br />\non reading selected works and discussing and<br />\nwriting papers about them. There will be no examination. Some important books - which<br />\nmight be usefully read this summer - are the<br />\nfollowing: E. H. Carr, What is History; G. R.<br />\nElton, The Practice of History; and J. H.<br />\nPlumb, The Death of the Past.<br />\nIn the second semester students will do - under the guidance of a faculty member of their<br />\nown selection - a piece of research and writing.<br />\nIts purpose will be to continue and deepen<br />\ntheir training in historical thinking and composition.<br /><br />\nHIS<br />\nOF<br />\nART<br />\n1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE<br />\nHISTORY OF ART Dr. Stanton<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was last given<br />\nin the fall of 1971. At that time 84 of the 109<br />\nstudents responding ranked the course as excellent. Eighteen thought it was only \"very good:\"<br />\nSo this goes on our \"recommended for those<br />\nwho want to try something else\" list. Note one<br />\ncomplaint of most people \u2014 that there were<br />\ntoo many people. What you can expect if you<br />\ntake the course are interesting, information \u2014<br />\npacked lectures, highlighted by slides, with possibly some difficulty in taking complete notes<br />\n(the only other major complaint: Dr. Stanton<br />\ntries to present too much material in her lectures.) The course grade is curved (B curve),<br />\nbased around two exams and a short paper on<br />\nthe aesthetics of some work of art - which<br />\nmost people thought a nice touch. All in all,<br />\none of the best coursesat Hopkins.<br /><br />\nHIS<br />\nOF<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of the<br />\nHistory of Science is introducing in the academic year 1973-74 a new program leading to the<br />\nB.A. degree with a major in Science and History. The object of this program will be to provide undergraduates with training both in the<br />\nsciences and history, thus enabling them to understand and to deal with the conceptual and<br />\ninstitutional nature of modern science and medicine. It is not the aim of the program solely to<br />\nproduce either literate scientists or scientifically<br />\ninformed humanists, although these might be<br />\nconsidered laudable aims, but rather to equip<br />\nstudents, whatever their ultimate professional<br />\ngoals, to comprehend the conceptual, technological, and social constraints which science<br />\nplaces upon modern society. In this light the<br />\nprogram will have appeal to students bound for<br />\none of the professions such as law, medicine,<br />\nteaching, and business, who in their careers will<br />\nbe forced to confrOnt aspects of the impact of<br />\nscience on modern society, or to deal with the<br />\ncultural decisions shaping the growth of science<br />\nitself.<br /><br />\nHUMANITIES<br />\n30.13 MAN AND HIS FICTIONS:<br />\nFORMS OF THE NARRATIVE<br />\nIN WESTERN LITERATURE<br />\nDr. Macksey<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n2<br />\n6<br />\n16<br />\n11<br />\n36<br />\n29/36<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is intended as<br />\na broad, introductory course surveying a variety<br />\nof texts, periods, and professors, and it succeeds in its intent. Students should expect to<br />\nread about 1 book a week (non-humanities people<br />\nmay find this a heavy load), write 3 short papers, and take a final, though Dr. Macksey<br />\nplans possible less reading and more emphasis<br />\non short, creative, analytical papers in the future. Grad students grade these papers and, like<br />\nmany grad students in other courses, grade<br />\ncomprehensively but stiffly. Class discussion also enters into the grade. The course seems to<br />\nbe an appealing alternative to the English dept.<br />\nsurvey courses and should be considered by<br />\nanyone with an interest in literature.<br /><br />\nMATHEMATICAL<br />\nSCIENCES<br />\nDepartment Statement: For three centuries the<br />\nprincipal applications of mathematics have been<br />\nto engineering and to the classical natural sciences: astronomy, physics, and chemistry. At the<br />\nsame time, these fields have been important<br />\nsources of inspiration and direction in the development of mathematics. Although the classical natural sciences were the first fields in<br />\nwhich mathematics was applied, there are today<br />\nmany others, for example, biology, operations<br />\nresearch, demography, management scinece, economics, information science, psychology,<br />\n,health care systems, sociology, ecology, and<br />\ncomputer science were until only recently either nonexistent or were large descriptive and<br />\nnon -quantitative. Now, however, mathematical<br />\nmethods and models are essential to each of<br />\nthem.<br />\nBasic mathematical methods remain essential<br />\nin the new fields of application, of course, but<br />\na glance at any of \u2022the current journals reveals<br /><br />\nthat many newer techniques are in wide use:<br />\nprobability , mathematical programming, statistical analysis and inference, optimal control,<br />\nstochastic processes, game theory, queuing<br />\ntheory, numerical analysis, information theory,<br />\ncombinatories, finite and discrete mathematics,<br />\nand decision theory. For want of any other<br />\nsummary description we shall refer to such<br />\nfields of modern applied mathematics collectively as the mathematical sciences. it is across<br />\nthis spectrum of activities that the programs of<br />\ninstruction and research of the Department of<br />\nMathematical Sciences are spread.<br />\nAt both the graduate and undergraduate levels the department's programs emphasize basic<br />\ntraining in the mathematical disciplines so<br />\nnecessary for science and management in the<br />\n1970's. Students are encouraged to broaden<br />\ntheir background and develop their scientific intuition by electing a variety of courses in the<br />\napplications. A typical program should prepare<br />\nthe student to continue his scientific career in<br />\neither theoretical or applied work (or both), as<br />\nhe chooses.<br /><br />\n24.2-3 COMPUTER LAB<br />\nCALCULUS I &amp; II Dr. Horn<br />\nProfessor's Statement: These one-hour courses<br />\nparallel the basic calculus corses. Numerical experiments and computer solution of problems<br />\nare used to illuminate the basic principles of<br />\nthe calculus. No prior computing experience is<br />\nrequired, but co-registration in the corresponding calculuscourseis necessary.<br /><br />\n24.11 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS<br />\nDr. Pyne<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Students taking this course<br />\nuniversally agree this is a very good course under an excellent teacher. Grading consists of a<br />\ncombination of homework and tests that is very fairly curved. No one should find the work<br />\noverly difficult yet it remains challenging and<br />\ninteresting. The text is very readable and non-specific in nature, a quality found desirable by<br />\nthe heterogeneous group of students taking this<br />\ncourse who want to get a general, introductory<br />\ncourse in practical statistics.<br /><br />\n24:55 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nMATH PROGRAMMING<br />\nDr. Elzinga<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a survey course<br />\nfor undergraduates who are curious about optimization methods and applications and who<br />\nwant a thorough survey at an elementary level.<br />\nMuch of the first semester will be spent on the<br />\ntopic of linear programming and other topics<br />\nrelated to it, such as the transportation problem and network flow problems. These subjects, while interesting theoretically, have found<br />\nwide application in industry and government.<br />\nThe second semester will be devoted to a number of other optimization techniques: game<br />\ntheory, dynamic programming, integer programming, nonlinear programming. A computer laboratory to be run in conjunction with the<br />\ncourse for those students knowledgable about<br />\ncomputer programming is being planned. Prerequisites for the course are Math 11.6-7 and<br />\nconcurrent registration in Math 11.10-11; for<br />\nthe computer laboratory, 24.62, Elements of<br />\nComputer Art and Science or equivalent.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Although this is an introductory course in Operations Research, it<br />\nseemed to already be fairly specialized. The<br />\ncourse for the most part was considered<br />\ndifficult with the tests rated particularly hard.<br />\nIn general the grading was considered fair<br />\nalthough there were complaints on the grading<br />\nof the homework. The text received mixed opinions, but the fact that those who expected<br />\nbetter grades rated it higher suggest that it is<br />\nnot that much help for making up what couldn't be understood in class. Students claimed to<br />\nspend 1-8 hours per week on the material with<br />\nthree being about average. This course seems to<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nbe best suited to those students who have a definite prior interest in the material.<br />\n(This review is a reprint of a previous review<br />\nof this professor and course.)<br /><br />\n24.62 ELEMENTS OF<br />\nCOMPUTER ART AND<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDr. Naddor<br />\nStudent Evaluation: If you are ever going to<br />\ntake ECAS (and you should--it is the best introduction to computers available, can be fun and<br />\nis not too difficult for those with logical<br />\nminds), we suggest you take ECAS now, while<br />\nDr. Naddor is teaching it. If you wait until<br />\nnext year, there are no guarantees.<br />\n(This evaluation is a reprint from the Fall<br />\n1972 Course Guide.)<br /><br />\n24.69 UNDERGRAD SEMINAR<br />\nIN COMPUTER USE AND<br />\nDr. Naddor<br />\nPROGRAMMING<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Students engaged in independent studies in computers report on the<br />\nprogress of their work. Occasionally other computer topics are presented informally by students, faculty, and guests.<br />\nECAS or its equivalent is a prerequisite. Students are encouraged to select relevant and useful projects.<br /><br />\n24.301 MATRIX ANALYSIS<br />\nAND LINEAR ALGEGRA<br />\nDr. Horn<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a second course<br />\nin linear algebra with emphasis on those parts<br />\nt of the subject which are useful in analysis, economics, statistics, mathematical programming<br />\nand numerical analysis. Students interested in<br />\nthese areas or in advanced work in science may<br />\nbe interested. Advanced calculus and a first<br />\ncourse in linear algebra are the prerequisites.<br /><br />\n24.315 INTRODUCTION<br />\nTO PROBABILITY<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This is a very difficult,<br />\ndemanding course that should not be taken for<br />\na grade by anyone who is not required to take<br />\nit. Students were reluctant to give the professor<br />\nhigh marks on teaching ability, but were very<br />\nwell satisfied with his accessibility. The text is<br />\nunfortunately very poor, with difficult problems and little clear explanation. The applications pertain more to the fields of physics and<br />\nengineering than others. Dr. Donelson gives<br />\nmany examples in problem-solving but does not<br />\ngive any insight into general application of<br />\ntheories other than those covered by specific<br />\nproblems assigned as homework. About half the<br />\ngrade is based on homework, and though the<br />\nprofessor claims no curve, there is a degree of<br />\ncompetition for grades.<br /><br />\n24.317 STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS<br />\nDr. Young<br />\n(<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: Studies of the behavior<br />\nof stochastic systems Initial emphasis is on a<br />\nreview of relevant stochastic processes and analystic techniques as a framework for understanding queuing phenomena; e.g., compound distributions, solution of differential - difference equ<br />\nations by means of generating functions, discrete and continuous time, Markov processes,<br />\ntime-homogeneous immigration-emigration,<br />\nbirth-death processes, etc. Stochastic systems,<br />\nsuch as single and multiple channel queues, and<br />\nsequential queues are then examined for their<br />\nunique characteristics and with an orientation<br />\ntoward application to real-world problems.<br />\nThis course will be aimed primarily at undergraduate students, with more emphasis in potential real-life application than theoretical virtuosity.

These<br />\nmodels are being used to help decision makers<br />\nforecast the future and weigh policy alternatives. The technical properties of the models<br />\nwill be analyzed along with the characteristics<br />\nof the problems to which the models are being<br />\napplied. The student should be versed in probabiliby theory, difference or differential equations, and computer programming.<br /><br />\n24.321 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nPROBABILITY THEORY<br />\nDr. Horn<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Probability spaces, combinatorial analysis, random variables, expectation, generating functions, detailed study of the<br />\ncommon distributions, elementary forms of the<br />\nbasic limit theorems. Emphasis is place more on<br />\nestablishing mathematical results than on applications to other scientific disciplines. A rigorous foundation is laid for further work in probability, stochastic processes or statistical inference.<br />\nPrerequisite: 11.10-11 or the equivalent and<br />\nco-registration in 11.315 or the equivalent.<br />\n\"A student who is interested in seeing clearly<br />\nwhat questions probability theory may answer<br />\nand gaining the ability to answer these questions himself in his own field will benefit greatly from this course.\"<br /><br />\n24.332 LEAST SQUARES AND<br />\nREGRESSION ANALYSIS<br />\nDr. Duncan<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a basic course in<br />\nthe graduate program in statistics and biostatistics. It is also aimed at meeting the needs for a<br />\nsound introduction to the theory and methods<br />\nof regression for advanced undergraduates and<br />\ngraduates in a wide variety of other areas including econometrics, psychometrics, environmental engineering, epidemiology, population dynamics.and the like.<br /><br />\n24.351 INVENTORY SYSTEMS<br />\nDr. Naddor<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The description in the<br />\n72 \u2014 73 catalog quite adequately describes the<br />\ncourse. Since extensive use is made of probability and digital computations, the prerequisites<br />\nof the course now include calculus (11.6-7), introduction to probability (24.315), and ECAS<br />\n(24.62) or their equivalents.<br /><br />\n24.353 FOUNDATIONS OF<br />\nMANAGEMENT SCIENCE<br />\nDr. Flagle<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n0<br />\n3<br />\n8<br />\n12<br />\n5<br />\n28<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Foundations of Management Science was generally thought to be too<br />\neasy for its three credits. The text is easy to<br />\nunderstand and the lecture covers the same basic material as the text with some personal examples of the professor thrown_ in. There was<br />\none exam with the choice of either a final exam or a paper, the exams being taken from the<br />\nlecture and text material. This course is recommended to O.R.'s, business majors, or anyone<br />\ninterested in the subject.<br />\n(Note: last offered as 55.353).<br /><br />\nMATHEMATICS<br />\nStatement: Various theories have<br />\nbeen advanced in the past (by us and others) as<br />\nto the. reason or reasons for the Mathematics<br /><br />\ndepartment not listing the professors for various classes. These theories have ranged from<br />\nmalicious (\"if they told who was teaching no<br />\none would sign up for the course\") to semi-logical (\"the Math department feels that any<br />\nprofessor is capable of teaching any course, so<br />\nprofessors are told during the summer\") to<br />\nnaive (\"the department never knows who is going to leave at any given time\"). We are happy<br />\nto be able to take this opportunity to clear up<br />\nany misunderstandings. The Math department<br />\ndoes not list professors because they do not<br />\nknow how many will be required for the lower<br />\nlevel courses. So assignments are given out after<br />\nthe number of students (before drops) is obtained. Logical, yes?<br />\nWe do, however, want to note that the department has made significant changes (the addition of 11 5', a \"review course\"; a complete<br />\nrestructuring of the lower level math progression; and a serious attempt to reduce the class<br />\nsizes for those lower level courses)Kudos to Dr.<br />\nSampson.<br /><br />\n11.301 ANALYSIS FOR SOCIAL<br />\nAND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES<br />\nDr. Meyer<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a course on differential equations and calculus of variations,<br />\nwith emphasis on applications in the biological<br />\nand social sciences. This includes detailed study<br />\nof specific models in fields such as physiology,<br />\necology, and economics. There were two examinations and one term paper. The only prerequisite is one year of calculus.<br />\nSpecial Note \u2014 Correction: In the Fall,<br />\n1972 issue an incorrect review of Mathematics<br />\ncourse number 11.301, Analysis for Social and<br />\nBehavioral Sciences, was printed. The correct<br />\nreview is as follows.<br />\nStudent reaction to this course was, without<br />\nexception, positive and enthusiastically so. A<br />\ngreat deal of material was covered, but not in<br />\ngreat depth, according to students. Some work<br />\noutside of class was required, but this was not<br />\nconsidered excessive. Perhaps the greatest value<br />\nof the course was that it presented what are often considered esoteric techniques in an informal manner, thus making the material understandable on an intuitive basis. Dr. Meyer was<br />\nrated as most helpful and usually well-prepared.<br />\nFor those people outside of physics, statistics,<br />\nor actual math majors, this course is enthusiastically recommended for those who desire a<br />\nworking knowledge of mathematical analysis<br />\nwithout studying the most esoteric details.<br /><br />\nMECHANICS AND<br />\nMATERIAL SCI.<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of Mechanics and Materials Science is the new name<br />\nfor the Department of Mechanics. In order to<br />\nmake full use of the broad interests of the faculty in undergraduate teaching and in order to<br />\nmaintain its position as the department ranked<br />\nfirst irr overall undergraduate satisfaction, as established by the responses to the Blue Ribbon<br />\nPanel's Undergraduate Questionnaire, several<br />\nimportant changes have been made. The department is now a part of the Natural Sciences as<br />\nwell as the Engineering Sciences and for the<br />\nfirst time offers undergraduate programs leading<br />\nto the Bachelor of Arts degree as well as the<br />\nBachelor of Engineering Science degree. All undergraduate courses are open to itudents in all<br />\ndepartments and all area majors. Moreover, the<br />\ndepartment offers accelerated programs, open<br />\nto all qualified undergraduates, which permit<br />\nadmission to graduate study as early as the end<br />\nof the sophomore year and which permit students to receive their bachelor's degree as well<br />\nas a master's or doctor of philosophy degree.<br />\nA number of new courses deserve special<br />\nmention, namely The Science of Modem Materials, The Mechanics of Animal Motion, Introductory Lectures on Acoustics, Materials Science Laboratory, Principles of Acoustics, Advanced Materials Science, Introduction to Ten-<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nsor Analysis, and Topics in Applied Mathematics.<br />\nThe faculty of the Department of Mechanics<br />\nand Materials Science is eager to discuss programs and individual courses with all undergraduates.<br /><br />\n50.11 THE SCIENCE OF<br />\nMODERN MATERIALS<br />\nDr. Pond<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Virtually all takers of this<br />\nintroductory course (two-thirds freshmen)<br />\nfound it stimulating, worthwhile, and enjoyable. Dubbed \"Metal Man\" for his enthusiasm<br />\nfor the subject, Dr. Pond is the prime asset of<br />\nthe course. The lectures, based on but not limited to handout lecture notes written by Pond<br />\nhimself, successfully balance theory and practice and stimulate the discussion that makes for<br />\na comfortable classroom atmosphere. Some students were inspired to extra efforts on their<br />\nown, while all agreed that the amount of work<br />\nrequired was just right for the credits. The<br />\nstraight grading, based 20% each on 4 open<br />\nbook hourlies and 20% on a paper, was cited as<br />\nfair and acceptable by all. Requiring no special<br />\nbackground, the course was recommended to<br />\nall, whether interested in engineering or just in<br />\nthe world around them.<br /><br />\n50.15 INTRODUCTORY<br />\nLECTURES ON ACOUSTICS<br />\nDrs. Hartman<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course provides an<br />\nintroductory overview of the broad field of<br />\nacoustics. During the first hour of each meeting<br />\na guest scientist or engineer will lecture on the<br />\narea of his experience pertaining to acoustics.<br />\nThe lectures are designed for the non -specialist,<br />\nincluding the Homewood freshman, who is interested in acquiring an interdisciplinary perspective of both the good and bad features of<br />\nmany acoustic phenomena. Some topics are<br />\nPhysiology of Hearing and Speech, Acoustics of<br />\nMusic, Bio-Acoustics, Ultrasonics and its<br />\nApplications, Noise Pollution and Noise Control. The second hour is used for open<br />\ndiscussion of the preceding lectures and for a<br />\ncontinuing development of the basic physics of<br />\nsound and the methods of its measurement and<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nThe guest speakers include professors from<br />\nthe Departments of Bio-Medical Engineering,<br />\nPsychiatry, Otology and Laryngology, Biology,<br />\nPsychology, Electrical Engineering, Mechanics<br />\nand Materials Science, and local engineers and<br />\npoliticians. Some class notes are distributed and<br />\nparticipants are requested to obtain a copy of<br />\nan elementary book on the general properties,<br />\nuses and abuses of sound.<br />\nStudents will be provided with summaries of<br />\nthe lectures and lists of suggested reading pertaining to each lecture. Each student is required<br />\nto write a short paper on any topic which is<br />\nrelevant to acoustics. No additional assignments<br />\nor examinations are given.<br /><br />\nMEASUREMENT AND<br />\n50.51<br />\nEXPERIMENTATION<br />\nDr. Kovasznay<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course consists of a<br />\nseries of non-related experiments touching on<br />\nmany important topics in engineering. The<br />\nform for the course is three hours of lecture every other week, with the intervening weeks be<br />\n- ing devoted to three hour lab sessions.<br />\nThe weakness of the course is the material<br />\npresented by Dr. Kovasznay. His lectures tend<br />\nto ramble, often containing discussions unrelated to the topic of the coming lab. The labs<br />\nare more concerned with quantitative methods<br />\nand the corresponding lab reports involved a<br />\ngreat deal of compilation of data and calculations. Grading is fairly rigorous.

This is a<br />\nnew course, given for the first time this year,<br />\nand is designed to permit undergraduates of all<br />\nages and backgrounds to participate successfully. The only requirement for the course is that<br />\neach gjoup of students must produce a sound<br />\nmovie (at least 100 ft. long) on some aspect of<br />\nmaterials. The content of the movie may be artistically pleasing or a technical exposition.<br />\nchoice of topic and method of production is<br />\nleft to the student. The professor and graduate<br />\njunior instructors serve as technical assistants<br />\nfor the undergraduates;. and assist them by supplying scientific advice, references to the<br />\nliterature, laboratory equipment, television and<br />\nmovie cameras, other photographic equipment,<br />\nand supplies. Undergraduates interested in the<br />\nmovies made during the current year are encouraged to watch the Newsletter for announcement of our special screening session<br />\nwhich will be open to the public.<br /><br />\nmentary problems, exercises are designed to aid<br />\nin understanding the principles and a few problems are solved in complete detail. Printed<br />\nnotes will be distributed weekly. No text is required for 301, while 302 usually requires a<br />\ntext.<br />\nStudents are expected to submit for grading<br />\ntheir work on the assigned weekly exercises.<br />\nThese exercises and related topics are disciissed in the weekly conference session. Three<br />\nlectures are given each week. Approximately<br />\nthree one-hour quizzes are given each semester.<br />\nThe final exam includes a take-home open-book<br />\npart and an in-class closed-book part. Grades<br />\nare assigned primarily in correlation with the<br />\nperformance on the final exams; however,<br />\nquizzes and homeworks are considered if they<br />\nhelp improve the student's grade.<br />\nI*<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Complaints were rampant<br />\nand kudos virtually absent from the responses<br />\nfor this course. Among the unpopular aspects<br />\nwere lengthy and difficult home assignments,<br />\ntoo much work for the 4 credits, lack of a<br />\ntext, and excessively theoretical lectures assuming prior knowledge not in the students'<br />\nbackgrounds. Grading is based on 3 quizzes and<br />\na comprehensive final, although the students indicated that they were unsure of the type of<br />\ngrading. The consensus among those who recommended it to anyone at all was to recommend the course Lo mechanics majors and those<br />\ninterested in advanced mechanics.<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Green is a very warm<br />\nand friendly guy. He seems not to be concerned with grades and is very interested in the<br />\ncourse he has set up. This course is a refreshing<br />\nbreak from a lot of typical courses. The course<br />\nconsists of a project involved with making a<br />\nmovie on materials and is graded subjectively.<br />\nThere is no required text, and the amount of<br />\nwork required was termed just right. Dr. Green<br />\ngoes over any material you need to know. This<br />\nlab is recommended for people who like to<br />\nmake movies and anyone with an interest in<br />\nmaterials.<br /><br />\n50.301 PRINCIPLES OF<br />\nMECHANICS Dr. Hartman<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSeniors<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n50.307 FLUID MECHANICS<br />\nDr. Corrsin<br /><br />\n1<br />\n3<br />\n8<br />\n2<br />\n1<br />\n15<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course establishes<br />\nand uses the principles necessary to describe<br />\nand predict the motion of several kinds of bodies which are subjected to a variety of forces.<br />\nSome specific motions include the study of vibrations of mass points, orbiting planets,<br />\nhanging cables, gyroscopes, engaging gears, billPiard balls,<br />\n40. stretching,<br />\nbending and<br />\n,twisting of<br />\n'\".solid rods,<br />\nwaves in solids<br />\nand fluids,<br />\nand fluid flow<br />\nin pipes.<br />\nI This course<br />\nemphasizes a<br />\nrational approach to the<br />\nmechanics of<br />\nboth rigid and<br />\ndeformable<br />\nmaterials.

No<br />\nprior knowledge of fluid mechanics is assumed,<br />\nbut the entering student should have completed<br />\nat least one term of intermediate level theoretical mechanics (e.g., 50.301 or 17.303), and<br />\nshould not blanch at the sight of a linear, ordinary differential equation. The course is designed for seniors or first-year graduate students<br />\nin engineering and physical sciences including<br />\ngeophysical sciences.<br />\nEmphasis is on physical understanding of the<br />\nmost common flow phenomena, with frequent<br />\nrecourse to mathematical modelling and to approximate solutions, especially of resulting nonlinear differential equations. Specific examples<br />\ninclude not only intrinsically motivated boundary value problems, but also the simplest flows<br />\nrelated to engineering, meteorology, oceanography, biology and everyday experience. Flow<br />\nmovies are shown nearly every week, outside<br />\nregular lecture hours. I hope that by the end of<br />\nthe year the student will have some perspective<br />\nof the field, with an idea of how the special<br />\nclasses of theoretical approximations relate to<br />\neach other and to flows of the real world.<br />\nMost exams are take-home, open book; undergraduates are graded independently of graduate students.<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Recommended by its students to math and mechanics majors and the<br />\nlike, the course is said to require work commensurate with its 3 credits. The lectures enlarge and review<br />\nthe material in Dr.<br />\nCorrisin's notes,<br />\nwhich form the<br />\ncourse text. Most<br />\nrespondents said<br />\nthe course was<br />\nneither too theoretical nor too practical; there was<br />\nsome criticism of<br />\nthe notes. The lectures review old<br />\nmaterial, go over<br />\nthe class notes,<br />\nand sometimes<br />\ncover additional topics. Most students did not<br />\nindicate how the course was graded; those who<br />\ndid disagreed on the type of grading but<br />\nthought the grading would be fair. It is apparently based on a take home comprehensive final and weekly homework.<br /><br />\n50.313 ELEMENTS OF<br />\nPHYSICAL METALLURGY<br />\nDr. Pond<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshman<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n0<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n3<br />\n11<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Recommended. by its students to mechanics majors and those interested<br />\nin metals, the course met with favorable overall<br />\nresponse from the eleven in the course. Said to<br />\nrequire just the right effort for the credits, the<br />\ncourse balances theory and practice. The lectures, neither repeating nor requiring material<br />\nfrom other courses, enlarge on .the material in<br />\nthe text, which was deemed fair. Grading,<br />\nbased on moderate amounts of homework and<br />\non open book hourlies from the text and lectures, was also considered to be fair.<br /><br />\n50.323 THERMODYNAMICS<br />\nDr. Schwartz<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n4<br />\n2<br />\n8<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course seemed generally well received by the students -- there was only an oral final exam, being 100% of the grade,<br />\nand one or two homework assignments. The<br />\namount of work required was termed \"just<br />\nright\", but a general criticism was that it was<br />\ntoo theoretical for most students. However, it<br />\nseems to be the best thermodynamics course on<br />\ncampus and is strongly recommended for mechanics, engineering, and general science majors.<br /><br />\nMILITARY<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Army ROTC Program at Hopkins is tailored to the Homewood<br />\nCampus environment. Formal aspects of the<br />\nprogram are detailed in the University catalog<br />\nand further information is available from the<br />\nDirector, Military Science Program,(Phone 294,<br />\n295,or 656). We expect to enroll women students beginning September,1973. Any Hopkins<br />\nstudent may take or audit any of the ROTC<br />\ncourses. A relatively popular one in the past<br />\nhas been American Military Heritage. Our<br />\n\"leadership laboratory\" consists of monthly<br />\nfour-hour sessions rather than the usual weekly<br />\none-hour affairs. These are planned and execu-<br /><br />\nted by the cadets and emphasize outdoor activity. In addition to the four one-year standardized courses, we offer two optional non- academic courses: mountaineering, orienteering, and<br />\nsurvivalias well as self-defense. These are free of<br />\ncharge and open to all students.<br />\nEditor's Note: Military Science courses, beginning this fall, will be academically oriented and<br />\nwill not be concerned with practical military<br />\nskills, which will be taught in the four hour<br />\ndrills once a month. Students may take any of<br />\nthe four courses (listed below) without joining<br />\nROTC, getting a uniform, or participating in<br />\ndrills (\"leadership labs\"). The courses are for<br />\nnon-credit, and as a result do not involve a particularly significant work load.<br /><br />\n12.1 GENERAL MILITARY<br />\nSCIENCE I Major Trapnell<br />\nProfessor's Statement: (Instructor has been<br />\nchanged.) Tentatively titled \"The Military and<br />\nSociety,\" the course will revolve around two<br />\nmain themes: problems of society and their impact on the military, and internal problems of<br />\nthe military which may or may not be mirrored<br />\nin other segments of society. There will be scattered readings from a variety of sources.<br /><br />\n12.3 MILITARY HERITAGE<br />\nCpt. Dombrowsky<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The emphasis in the<br />\ncourse is not so much on the U.S. Army's successes (and failures) in war as it is the reasons<br />\nfor the outcomes of battles and wars. Though<br />\nthe course covers the period from the Revolutionary War through Vietnam, it will not be in<br />\nstrictly chronological order. Rather, an attempt \u2022<br />\nwill be made to carry through various changes<br />\nand trends as they affect wars and battles. The<br />\nemphasis will be on the twentieth century.<br /><br />\n12.5 SEMINAR IN<br />\nLEADERSHIP AND<br />\nMANAGEMENT<br />\nCpt. Pearson &amp; Cpt. Hemphill<br />\nProfessors' Statement: The course will focus on<br />\nthe factors that affect leadership and management, and some manners and means of improvement. Subject matter will be from various<br />\nfields: Psychology, Operations Research, Organizational Theory, and others.<br /><br />\n12.7 THE MILITARY TEAM<br />\nMajor Trapnell<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The main theme will be<br />\nco-operation and problem solving within the<br />\nframework and organization of the Army. An<br />\nattempt will be made to simulate the organization and the roles to be played within it, to<br />\nstudy conflict, co-operation , and compromise<br />\nthat result from responsibilities of different leadership positions.<br /><br />\nNEAR<br />\nEASTERN<br />\nSTUDIES<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of<br />\nNear Eastern Studies offers courses in the civilizations of the ancient Near East. This covers<br />\nthe entire fertile crescent from Mesopotamia in<br />\nthe east to Egypt in the west. This geographical<br />\nextension is matched by the span of time dealt<br />\nwithini the department \u2014 approximately three<br />\nmillenia. Although the emphasis of the department is in philological work, there is great concern to portray the ancient Near East as a culvirally integrated area consisting of regions<br />\nwith their own individual developments. Like<br />\nthe personality, it is a compound of literature,<br />\nreligion, and history which makes up the intellectual patterns of these parts. The department<br />\noffers courses in these fields, in addition to<br />\nNear-Eastern archaeology. None of these courses<br /><br />\nPage 11<br />\nrequire any previous training although familiarity with a foreign language is helpful. In addition, all graduate courses in the department are<br />\nopen to anyone, provided the person can meet<br />\nthe standards of such a course. There is no distinction between graduate and undergraduate<br />\nstudents because the aim of the department is<br />\nthe intellectual adventure of the ancient Near<br />\nEast at the earliest stage of recorded human<br />\nhistory.<br /><br />\n13.7 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nISLAMIC CIVILIZATION<br />\nDr. Krotkoff<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The purpose of the<br />\ncourse is to present the basic facts about one<br />\nof the main civilizations of humanity, which is<br />\ngreatly ignored or misunders .,od in the West.<br />\nThe emphasis will be on backgronnd, formagre:i. intellection, and periods and areas<br />\not<br />\ntual and artistic productivity<br />\n.ed.<br />\nboth, Arabs and Persians, \u2018. 1 bc<br />\navailaSlides and films (the latter dependi<br />\nObjectbility) will be shown during the cow<br />\nive tests on Geography, History,and Religion<br />\nwill be administered.

Classroom atmosphere was described by some in such extremes as tyrannical and \"reminiscent of Auschwitz,\" although most criticisms of the class had<br />\na milder tone. On the positive side, several students found Dr. Goedicke a fascinating man<br />\nand claimed they enjoyed his ability and witty<br />\nhandling of questions. He was described by<br />\nsome as very knowledgable. Also, the readings,<br />\nnone of which arerequired, are considered good.<br />\nIf the student has an interest in the area of ancient Egyptian religion and is not easily intimidated, this might be a course to consider taking. Those who tend toward paranoia should<br />\nnot attempt it, however.<br />\n(Reprint)<br /><br />\n13.319 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nTHE ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY<br />\nOF THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST<br />\nDr. Carter<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Overall response to this<br />\ncourse was positive. The only negative statements were suggestions that friends not take the<br />\ncourse, but this seems to be due to the fact<br />\nthat the subject is a little esoteric and unfamiliar, rather than due to intrinsic fault(s) of the<br />\ncourse itself. Lectures were described as interesting, unanimously as well-organized, and the<br />\ninterest seemed to be due to the inclusion of<br />\nantifactual and visual material. Exams were<br />\nconsidered both difficult and suitable; grading<br />\n\"fair,\" \"good system;\" class atmosphere, both<br />\ninformal and relaxed. Attendance appears high.<br />\nA stressed factor was the fact that the student<br />\nwho takes the course must be interested in the<br />\nsubject, i.e. motivation is a must.<br />\n(Reprin t<br /><br />\nNON<br />\nDEPARTMENTAL<br />\n30.353 THE GREAT TRADITION<br />\nIN MUSIC<br />\nDr. Galkin<br />\nStudent Evaluation:This is one of the very few<br />\nmusic courses offered, but luckily for<br /><br />\nSpring 1973<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nbuffs it is also one of the most interesting and<br />\nenjoyable courses available at Hopkins.<br />\nThe course itself is described as \"relaxed\"<br />\nand fairly easy. There are no tests, and just one<br />\nfinal paper of 15-20 pages. This paper constitutes the only real work in the course, aside<br />\nfrom attending classes. Though unstructured,<br />\nthe class is interesting and rated between very<br />\ngood and excellent. The students themselves<br />\nwere partially responsible for this, with the at-mosphere relaxed, and classmates described as<br />\ninterested and intelligent but definitely not<br />\nthroatish.<br />\nThe professor, Elliot Galkin, is undoubtedly<br />\nthe reason for the class's high degree of success.<br />\nHe is rated very highly in all aspects, and described as an \"encyclopedia of music,\" but still<br />\ncasual, interesting and even entertaining. His<br />\nrambling style and the lack of structure in his<br />\nlectures were sometimes noted as weaknesses,<br />\nalthough the majority of students felt these<br />\ncharacteristics were not only appropriate to the<br />\nmaterial covered, but were also vital to the relaxed nature and appeal of the course.<br />\nThe only recommendation that the students<br />\nhad were that more courses in music be offered, on any topic, just so long as a greater selection be made available.<br /><br />\nPHILOSOPHY<br />\nDepartment Statement: Courses in the Philosophy Department provide historical and systematic apprnaches to philosophical issues. Historical<br />\ncourses study answers that Western philosophers of the past have given to such questions<br />\nas what moral principles men should follow and<br />\nwhy; the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body; what knowledge consists of<br />\nand how it is possible for man to have knowledge of an external world, of objects in science<br />\nthat he cannot observe, and of the minds of<br />\nothers; whether determinism is true and if so<br />\nwhether it is. possible for then to act freely;<br />\nwhat principles of reasoning men ought to use.<br />\nSystematic courses in ethics, metaphysics, and<br />\nthe philosophy of the mind will focus on a single topic or group of topics and will often consider both historical and contemporary approaches. Courses in the philosophy of science,<br />\nthe philosophy of history, and philosophy in literature examine philosophical and methodological problems that arise in the various disciplines. Courses in logic study formal techniques<br />\nand principles of modern symbolic logic.<br />\nBasically, the aim of philosophy courses is to<br />\nget students to think critically and analytically<br />\nabout philosophical issues. This is done not by<br />\npresenting one final, dogmatic position, but by<br />\nexamining a variety of approaches and by training students to raise questions that will expose<br />\nunjustified assumptions, logical connections between claims, fallacies in reasoning, and the<br />\nneed for sustained argumentation.<br /><br />\n15.11 PHILOSOPHIC<br />\nCLASSICS<br />\nDr. Mandelbaum<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course is intended<br />\nto be an introduction to philosophy which raises some of the basic problems of philosophy; it<br />\ndoes so through readings and discussions of<br />\nphilosophic works which lend themselves to<br />\nthis approach.<br />\nIn the spring term of 1973, the syllabus was<br />\ndrastically revised as compared with previous<br />\nyears; it cut down on the number of philosophers studied, and it attempted to broaden the<br />\nbase of the problems discussed. The three philosophers studied in 1973 were John Stuart<br />\nMill, William James, and Nietzsche. Until I conduct a student evaluation comparable to those I<br />\nhave conducted in other years, I cannot know<br />\nwhether I shall continue to confine the course<br />\nthe same 19th and 20th century authors, or<br />\nack to something more like<br /><br />\nearlier syllabi. It is unlikely, however, that the<br />\ncourse will include any works earlier than Descartes.<br />\nWhether or not there will be one or more<br />\nshort papers in the course depends on the authors to be studied. There will in any case be an<br />\nhour exam and a traditional style final.<br /><br />\n15.39 TUTORIAL SEMINAR<br />\nDr. Gottlieb<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will be an<br />\nattempt to see Judaism from the inside, in<br />\nterms of its own concepts and values. The<br />\nscope will include the quality of the religious<br />\ndimension of experience, as well as the fundamentals of Jewish faith and ideology. Although<br />\nboth modern (e.g. Heschel, Buber) and classical<br />\n(Bible, Talmud) will be used, the course is open<br />\nto all undergraduates regardless of Jewish or<br />\nphilosophical background. It will be run as<br />\nmuch as possible as a seminar: students will be<br />\nasked to lead discussions on assigned readings.<br />\nTwo papers will be required \u2014 one five pager<br />\nfor the mid-term and one ten pager at the end<br />\nof the semester.<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: As usual, the comments on<br />\nDr. Mandelbaum's course ranged from excellent<br />\nto superb to fantastic. The course itself was<br />\nthought to be interesting, but the tests were<br />\nconsidered difficult with stiff but fair grading.<br />\nThe conferences were almost a total waste of<br />\ntime and only provided a contrast to Dr. Mandelbaum's shining example, which was the main<br />\nattraction of the course.<br />\n(Reprint)<br /><br />\n15.35 PHILOSOPHY OF<br />\nRELIGION<br />\nDr. Barker<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: All ten respondants said<br />\nDr. Gottlieb was an excellent professor. Adjectives used included interesting, energetic, knowledgable, enthusiastic. Those not planning to<br />\nmajor in Philosophy split about 50 \u2014 50 on<br />\ntheir desire to take more courses in the department, somewhat atypical for a philosophy<br />\ncourse. The only complaint (there is always at<br />\nleast one complaint) was that the workload<br />\n(much reading plus one ten-page paper) was excessive for a one-credit course. (Note: the review is from Dr. Gottlieb's Spring 1972 freshman seminar on \"Pragmatism: Truth, Knowledge, and Religion.\")<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will deal<br />\nwith philosophical problems concerning religion<br />\nand religious belief. Topics to be treated include faith and rationality, religious uses of language, theology and meaningness, mysticism,<br />\nevil and predestination. The course will not offer a survey of world religions nor will it concentrate on any one particular religion. It will<br />\nbe concerned with certain intellectual problems<br />\nthat arise for anyone who tries to think clearly<br />\nabout religion. The viewpoints of a variety of<br />\nphilosophers and theologians will be considered<br />\ncritically. There will be some short papers to<br />\nwrite and a final examination.<br /><br />\n15.309 SYMBOLIC LOGIC<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Barker strikes again!<br />\nHis coverage of the material was clear,<br />\nthorough,and spiced liberally with his very dry<br />\nwit. However, the lectures were often<br />\nrepetitious and slow moving, as Dr. Barker wandered off onto trivial tangents. The readings<br />\nwere noted as excellent in all respects, but constituting a reasonably heavy work load and demanding several hours each week. Tests are almost objective and come straight from the<br />\nreadings and lecture notes. Paper topics were<br />\nlimited, and a greater selection would prove<br />\nhelpful. The grading was fair and was based on<br />\ntwo papers, a midterm, and a final, but one<br />\nsnag was nitpicking quizzes given in conference<br />\nsections, making attendance there necessary. If<br />\nyou would like a general philosophy course delivered in an understated manner, this could be<br />\nit.<br />\n(Reprint)<br /><br />\nDr. Gottlieb<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n29/39<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course is a must for<br />\nanyone with even a vague interest in logic or<br />\nfor anyone whose major has logical aspects. Dr.<br />\nGottlieb is an enthused, knowledgable, and altogether excellent teacher (though a strict grader and perhaps a bit fast) who is genuinely interested in having his students master the difficult material thoroughly. This is evidenced by<br />\nhis excellent, mimeographed notes to the reading. There is not a great deal of work in the<br />\ncourse, but time is required to master it. The<br />\ncourse looks like a good way for quantitative<br />\nand engineering people to pick up pass/fail H<br />\ncredits. Someone electing the course should<br />\nhave some math or philosophy background.<br /><br />\n4-211<br /><br />\nP. e 13<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br /><br />\n15.331 PHILOSOPHY OF<br />\nSCIENCE Dr. Achinstein<br /><br />\nwho responded (approximately half the class<br />\nwas composed of pads) were satisfied with almost all aspects of the class except the teaching<br />\nassistant, who was called \"rude\" by one student and \"not quite qualified\" by the other.<br />\nThe course was considered to be exactly what<br />\nits title said: an introduction to a field of<br />\nphysics.<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: The aim of, the course is<br />\nto study the philosophical and methodological<br />\nassumptions to which scientists are or ought to<br />\nbe committed. Is there one rational method for<br />\nScientists, several, or perhaps none at all? To<br />\nwhat patterns, if any, should scientific explanations conform? Do theories describe reality or<br />\nare they merely symbolic instruments for making predictions? Readings will be from contemporary writings within the philosophy of<br />\nscience, and attention will be given to the views<br />\nof those who construe science as an idealized,<br />\nlogical system;as well as to those who view science in a less abstract, more historical fashion.<br /><br />\nROMANCE<br />\nLANGUAGES<br />\n21.1 FRENCH ELEMENTS<br />\nProfessor's Statement: French Elements is designed for students with little or no previous instruction in French. Oral pRificiency is the major goal. Reading and writing skills are concurrently developed. Classroom participation is essential<br /><br />\n15.343 ANALYTIC<br />\nPHILOSOPHY IN THE 20TH<br />\nCENTURY<br />\nDr. Barker<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will offer a<br />\nsurvey of British and American analytic philosophy, starting with Moore and Russell, proceeding to Wittgenstein and Logical Positivism,<br />\nand then concluding ,with more recent linguistic<br />\nphilosophy such as that of Quine. Ryle, and<br />\nAustin. ProblFius in, metaphysics. theory of<br />\nknowledge,. an e4Jics will be treated. The aim<br />\nof the course is to. otter an over7view of the recent history of this influential movement in<br />\nphilosophy. There will be some short papers to<br />\nwrite and a Final examination.<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: French Elements was well<br />\nreceived, and the instructors were commended<br />\nfor being very able and enthusiastic. The work<br />\nload was moderate, most students feeling that<br />\ntwo to four hours per week was all that was<br />\nnecessary. The text was sharply criticized and<br />\nseemed to be the worst part of the course. The<br />\nlanguage lab was also considered to be a waste<br />\nof time. Even though this course was taken for<br />\nrequirement fulltillment, the students enjoyed<br />\nthe course and the instructors.<br /><br />\nPHYSICS<br />\n17.3 GENERAL PHYSICS FOR<br />\nPHYSICAL SCIENCE MAJORS II<br />\nDr. Henry<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n2<br />\n38<br />\n4<br />\n46<br />\n15/46<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: Special relativity , electromagnetism, optics and wave motion in the<br />\nfirst semester; quantum physics in the second<br />\nsemester. This is a fast-moving tough-minded introduction to the basic ideas of modern physics, designed to build an intellectual base for<br />\nmore advanced work. It should be fun, if you<br />\nrefuse to let it scare you. Problems every week,<br />\nand frequepests with no final.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Most of the respondents<br />\nrecommended this course, but with reservations. The students found the text good to excellent, and most learned a great deal as a result. They felt that Dr. Henry's lectures were<br />\ntoo fast and that too much (and difficult) material was presented in them. Half of the students found Dr. Henry interested in the students and willing to answer questions in class,<br />\nwhile the other half did not.<br />\nThe majority of people spent 10 to 20 hours<br />\na week on outside work, thus felt the 5 credits<br />\nquite appropriate. Perhaps a bit less time would<br />\nhave been necessary, had the answers in the<br />\nback been more than 2/3 correct. All in all,<br />\nthis course is recommended if you have time<br />\nfor long lectures, long tests, and a lot of hard,<br />\nbut worthwhile outside study.<br /><br />\n17.305 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY<br />\nDr. Zdanis<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n7<br />\n4<br />\n9<br />\n21<br />\n2/21<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: The two graduate students<br /><br />\n21.5 INTERMEDIATE FRENCH:<br />\nREADING, CONVERSATION,<br />\nCOMPOSITION<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The goal of this course<br />\nis to develop speaking and writing skills. Contemporary literary texts are used as a basis for<br />\nthe review of language structure, dictation, imitative and free composition, class and lab drill.<br /><br />\n21.7 FRENCH LANGUAGE<br />\nTHROUGH LITERATURE<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Grammar is covered<br />\nmore intensively than in 21.5-6 and there are<br />\nadditional literary texts.<br /><br />\n21.9 ADVANCED FRENCH<br />\nProfessor's -Statement: Advanced Intermediate<br />\nFrench is designed for students who have a<br />\nstrong background in spoken and written<br />\nFrench but who are not ready for a course be.<br />\nyond the Intermediate Level. There is an in<br />\nreview of grammar, a lot of composition<br />\nwork and several literary texts are read and discussed each semester.<br /><br />\n21.15 TRANSLATION: HISTORY,<br />\nPRACTICE<br />\nTHEORY<br />\nDr. Gossman<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This is a new course, designed in part for students who wish to .continue their language studies in French beyond intermediate. I hope to include in it (1) some discussion of the significance of the concept of<br />\ntranslation for literary theory,(2) a brief consideration of translation as it has been understood and practiced at different times, (3) a<br />\ncomparative study of some sample translations,<br />\nand (4) practical work in translation from Engh<br />\nsh to Frech and from French to English. The<br />\npractical work, which should take up more<br />\nthan half the course, will cover various types of<br />\nscientific texts. newspaper and magazine<br />\ntext<br />\narticles, diplomatic texts, private letters, historical narratives, fictional narratives and. poetic<br />\ntexts. The different problems which each of<br />\nthese types presents to the translator will, I<br />\nhope, illuminate both the nature of translation<br />\nand the nature of texts.<br /><br />\n21.29 SPANISH ELEMENTS<br />\nCourse Distributioi.

Most of them .had laready had two or three years of high-school<br />\nSpanish; the material in Spanish elements was<br />\nfamiliar. Reviews can be very enjoyable, and<br />\nthis course was no exception. Discussion was<br />\nemphasized, so one could get in some good<br />\npractice of conversational skills. Weekly quizzes, language lab, four exams throughout the<br />\ncourse, and readings comprised the usual tools<br />\nof the trade for this beginning language course.<br />\nThe grad instructor was well-received by students; his interest, enthusiasm, and knowledge<br />\nmade 21.29 more than an empty formality for<br />\npeople who want easy credits. The pace was<br />\nfast, as most of the students already knew their<br />\nstuff. A novice, however, might have found it<br />\nrough going. (Note: this review covers one of<br />\nthe two sections of 21.29 taught last fall.)<br /><br />\n21.47 SPANISH<br />\nCONVERSATION &amp;<br />\nDr. Rivers<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Two textbooks will be<br />\nused: one\u2022 emphasizes vocabulary study and<br />\nword usage in everyday \"newspaper\" Spanish;<br />\nthe other is a collection of modern short stories, to be used as a basis for discussion in class.<br />\nThe course is designed to improve the active<br />\ncommand of spoken and written Spanish on<br />\nthe part of students who have a firm grasp of<br />\nfundamental grammar and vocabulary.<br /><br />\n21.301 FRENCH FOR<br />\nREADING KNOWLEDGE<br />\nCOMPOSITION<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course is for students who have completed French Elements at<br />\nHopkins or have the equivalent background,<br />\nand for graduate students who wish to prepare<br />\nfor a reading exam. The grammar is oriented<br />\ntowards developing reading comprehension and<br />\ntranslation skills. Reading material is chosen to<br />\nfulfill the needs of the students in their major<br />\nfields. Oral skills are not emphasized and the<br />\ncourse is conducted in English.<br /><br />\n21.313 FRENCH THEATER<br />\nTO THE REVOLUTION<br />\nDr. Gossrnan<br />\nProfessor's Statement: In addition to the main<br />\ndramatic texts, there will be discussion of other<br />\nthe theatrical space,<br />\naspects of th.., theatre<br />\nthe various sig.,' systems that constitute the theatrical events (words, gestures, costume, lighting, decor, etc.), and the social function of theatrical art.<br /><br />\n21.321 SPANISH NOVEL<br />\nXX C.: THE GENERATION<br />\nDr. Olson<br />\nOF '98<br />\nProfessor's Statement: Lectures and discussion<br />\non five or six novels by such authors as Viramuno, Azorin, Valle-Inclan, and Baroja.

The professor lectured on such poets as Jimenez, Lorca, Guillen,<br />\nand Hernandez, and opportunity was there for<br />\nclass discussion. Two rather involved papers (a<br />\nmedterm and a final) were required as well as<br />\nseveral oral presentations, all dealing with the<br />\npoets covered in the course. This course<br />\nattracts a small and specialized clientele. Prior<br />\ninterest and knowledge are musts. Students<br />\nwere pleased with the course and no problems<br />\nwith grading occurred. (Note: this review is<br />\nfrom Dr. Olson's course last fall \u2014 21.65<br />\nwith the same title. We assume that course<br />\nwhich was characterized as 300-level \u2014 has<br />\nsimply ,been renumbered.)<br /><br />\nPOLITICAL<br />\nECONOMY<br />\n18.1 ELEMENTS OF<br />\nECONOMICS(MACRO)<br />\nDr. Christ<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Christ is always wellreceived. In fact, while the reaction to the<br />\ncourse is mixed, Dr. Christ is rated good to excellent by almost everyone. Most students expect an A or B in the course; the few who did<br />\nnot tend to criticize Dr. Christ, Samuelson's<br />\ntext, or the other students. But a surprising<br />\nnumber of 'B' students when asked what they<br />\nlike best about the course, say \"nothing.\"<br />\nDr. Christ has a very open approach to this<br />\nclass and to his students \u2014 there is usually time<br />\nto set aside in lecture for questions and discussion. Current events summary on Monday is<br />\nnice, except for those students who already understand the matters. Perhaps that is the best<br />\nway to summarize the dilemma of this course:<br />\nto present economics simultaneously to math<br />\nand economic majors as well as to the less<br />\nmathematically-oriented student, and to face<br />\nstudents whose economic knowledge ranges<br />\nfrom a great deal to staggering ignorance.<br />\nConference instructor reviews are mixed. A<br />\nfew instructors are good, others incoherent.<br />\nThe existence of an extra-credit paper, which<br />\ncannot count<br />\nagainst the student if he<br />\ndecides to do it but may raise his grade as<br />\nmuch as one letter, should be mentioned, with<br />\nthe warning that the paper is graded very strictly.<br />\nSummary: A not-too-difficult course which<br />\nupon occasion can be boring. Should be taken<br />\nfor the exposure to economics, if nothing else.<br />\n(This evaluation is a reprint from the Spring<br />\n1972 Course Guide.)<br /><br />\n18.330 COMPARATIVE<br />\nSYSTEMS AND PLANNING<br />\nDr. Balassa<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Balassa has been very<br />\nsuccessful in presenting a well-organized and interesting course. His lectures are easily followed<br />\nand contain a great deal of information. The<br />\ntests are considered very fair, and the majority<br />\nof the class will find the course very worthwhile and informative. (This evaluation is a reprint from the Spring 1972 Course Guide and<br />\nconsists of material from other courses taught<br />\nby Dr. Balassa.)<br /><br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br /><br />\n18.337 ECONOMETRICS<br />\nDr. Maccini<br />\nProfessor's Statement: The purpose of the<br />\ncourse is to give the student an introduction to<br />\nempirical work in economics. The course will<br />\ninvolve a development of empirical techniques<br />\nin a non-rigorous and heuristic fashion as well<br />\nas a discussion of empirical work that has been<br />\nperformed in subjecting various economic<br />\ntheories (e.g. the consumption function, investment, etc.) to tests with data. Students will be<br />\nrequired to do a research project of an empirical nature.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: It is rare that the response<br />\nto a professor is as overwhelmingly positive as<br />\nit was to Dr. Maccini, who can only be<br />\ndescribed with glowing adjectives. With interesting, comprehensive, and well-delivered lectures (though sometimes a bit fast to take good<br />\nnotes), Dr. Maccini succeeds in communicating<br />\nthe subject matter, in stimulating student ideas,<br />\nand in fielding questions and problems from<br />\nstudents. Fair with respect to exams and grading, Dr. Maccini did not burden the students<br />\nwith heavy and difficult reading assignments.<br />\n(This evaluation is a reprint from the Fall 1972<br />\nCourse Guide and consists of material taken<br />\nfrom other courses given by Dr. Maccini.)<br /><br />\n18.364 EVALUATION OF<br />\nPUBLIC INVESTMENTS<br />\nDr. Sparrow<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This is a course covering a<br />\nwide range of material that is difficult to organize properly, and Dr. Sparrow succumbs to this<br />\ndifficulty. The only common complaint students have about the course is his lack of continuity which is important since lectures are the<br />\nmost educational part of the course. There is<br />\nvery little reading and it is mostly supplementary. The course grade is determined from a<br />\nmidterm and a paper; since Course Guide questionnaires were distributed early in the year the<br />\nlast time this course was given, no information<br />\nis available as to grading policy. Dr. Sparrow<br />\ndoes review pertinent past material as need be<br />\nand does not seem to require learning of difficult concepts.<br /><br />\nPOLITICAL,<br />\nSCIENCE<br />\nDepartment Statement: The Department of Political Science seeks to promote understanding<br />\nof politics and political behavior as well as the<br />\ninstitutions and processes through which public<br />\npolicy is formed in varying political systems.<br />\nThe department offers a broad range of courses<br />\nabout politics and government at local, state,<br />\nnational, and international levels, including the<br />\nfollowing fields: American politics, comparative<br />\ngovernment and politics, internatidnal law and<br />\nrelations, political theory, public administration<br />\nand public policy, public law and judicial behavior, and urban politics.<br />\nThe political science major is designed for<br />\nstudents interested in intensive study of the institutions and problems of modern government.<br />\nIt is well suited for students aspiring to law<br />\nschool or graduate training in political science.<br />\nOther students interested in the political process<br />\nshould take an area major in the social and behavioral sciences with a concentration in political science. The department also offers a separate program leading to a B.A. or B.A.-M.A. degrees in international studies and participates in<br />\nthe Curriculum for Political Leadership.<br /><br />\n19.1 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nAMERICAN GOVERNMENT<br />\nDr. Crenson<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br /><br />\n76<br />\n48<br /><br />\n23<br />\n20<br />\n167<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: The class expressed much<br />\nsurprise over the approach, expecting a \"constitution and separation of powers\" rehash. Instead there is a philosophical and civil rights approach. Professor Crenson is knowledgeable, interesting, enthusiastic,: and witty. The lectures<br />\nare the high point of the course. The only criticism of the lectures is they often moved too<br />\nquickly for note taking.<br />\nThe readings cannot compete with the lectures. They take maybe four hours weekly and<br />\nprovide supporting evidence for the lectures.<br />\nThe grading is considered fair, but occasionally<br />\narbitrary. So much for splitting hairs.<br />\nBasically, everybody raves about the course.<br />\nDr. Crenson takes a traditionally bust subject<br />\nand presents it well and from an interesting<br />\nperspective.<br /><br />\n19.21 AMERICAN PARTIES<br />\nAND POLITICS<br />\nDr. Cummings<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The main element of Professor Cumming's courses seems to be the readings. Readings are generally considered controversial and provoking. The texts are also the<br />\nmost informative part of the course. Dr. Cummings himself is interesting, promotes class discussion and is readily available for consultation<br />\nand questions. The major criticism of Professor<br />\nCummings is his work loads are often far in excess of the credits or course level. The major<br />\npraise of his course is that they are usually<br />\n\"great.\"<br /><br />\n19.81 THE PRESIDENT AND<br />\nTHE EXECUTIVE BRANCH<br />\nDr. Rourke<br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course deals with<br />\nthe power and activities of the President and<br />\nexecutive agencies. The purpose of the course is<br />\nto understand the kind of influence executive<br />\nofficials, especially the President, have on the<br />\npolitical development of American society. The<br />\ncourse focuses on the presidential office \u2014 the<br />\nroles the President plays, and the sources of executive power. It does not deal in any detail<br />\nwith presidential elections \u2014 the strategies involved in winning a presidential nomination or<br />\nthe factors determining the outcome of presidential elections.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\n19.305 POLITICS AND SOCIETY<br />\nIN THE SOVIET UNION<br />\nDr. Gilison<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Gilison apparently is<br />\nwell prepared and well versed. His lectures were<br />\nstimulating and logically presented. The class<br />\nwas conducted in a friendly and relaxed manner. Grading is \"extremely hard\" and there is a<br />\nheavy load of generally excellent reading. As<br />\none student stated, \"be prepared for one grade<br />\nlower than you expect, but take the course any<br />\nway.\" A very good course in an interesting area; well worth the effort. \u2014<br />\n(Reprint.)<br /><br />\n1!<br />\n)A<br /><br />\n19.309 CONTEMPORARY<br />\nINTERNATIONAL POLITICS<br />\nDr. Rothstein<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduate<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n1<br />\n21<br />\n18<br />\n22<br />\n1<br />\n63<br />\n38/63<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: The word \"excellent\"<br />\ndominates the comments on most facets of this<br />\ncourse. Dr. Rothstein was consistently and<br />\nhighly praised. The class was amazed by his<br /><br />\n21<br /><br />\nPage 15<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br />\nknowledge, inspired by his interest, and cautioned by his cynicism. Dr. Rothstein's lectures<br />\nwere considered interesting, comprehensive, and<br />\nenjoyable, but occasionally moved too quickly<br />\nto take thorough notes. Dr. Rothstein seems to<br />\nhave the ability to make strategies of nuclear<br />\nannihilation simueltaneously entertaining and<br />\nreal. Questions were taken with interest and answered in detail.<br />\nThe readings for the course are extensive.<br />\nThe readings complemented but did not repeat<br />\nthe lectures. Time claimed to be spent reading<br />\nvaried, but centered on four or five hours<br />\nweekly. Everything is on reserve in Hutzlers.<br />\nMost students said they would recommend<br />\nthe course to others. Many felt satisfied enough<br />\nWith the course not to mind about the grading.<br />\nPeople overly worried about gradepoints should<br />\nremember there are a few \"A\"s and about 50%<br />\nInternational Relations and Political Science<br />\nmajors.<br /><br />\n19.311 SEMINAR IN THE<br />\nLEGISLATIVE PROCESS<br />\nDr. Peabody<br />\nProfessor's Statement: My course will follow<br />\nthe general outline of last fall's course with less<br />\nemphasis on congressional elections, and more<br />\non the current conflict between the President<br />\nand Congress. Several new books will be substituted for present readings. The course is primarily designed for students who might wish to<br />\nwork in Congress, understand its complexity, or<br />\nconceivably, some day, run for the House or<br />\nSenate. Why .not? That's the most appropriate<br />\nway to change Congress and ultimately the political system.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Peabody was generally<br />\ndescribed in very favorable terms by his students. While his lectures have a tendency to be<br />\nslowmoving and lacking in structure, they are<br />\nnevertheless interesting. The class especially appreciated the insights gained from Dr. Peabody's personal experiences. The course has a<br />\nrelaxed, seminar-type structure. The readings<br />\nwere a series of mildly interesting paperbacks.<br />\nThe load was rather light. One medium-length<br />\n(15-20 pages) term paper (original research preferred) is required. This paper counts heavily<br />\nbut is fairly graded. There is also a comprehensive, reading-oriented final.<br />\n(Reprint)<br /><br />\n19.313 CONTEMPORARY<br />\nPOLITICAL THEORY<br />\nDr. Melvin<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Professor Melvin is deply<br />\ninterested in political,theory. His lectures are<br />\napparently rather dry but interesting, informative, and relevant. There are complaints that<br />\nProfessor Melvin occasionally lectures above the<br />\nclasses' level of understanding. Papers are read<br />\nwell and thoroughly analyzed. Grading is reportedly \"liberal.\"<br /><br />\n19.381 GOVERNMENT &amp;<br />\nAND POLITICS OF CHINA<br />\nDr. Pfeffer<br />\nStudent Evaluation: One rarely hears derogatory<br />\ncriticism of Dr. Pfeffer's courses. Typically, the<br />\nlectures are articulate and provoking, occasionally accompanied by slides or films, but are also long and extremely quick. Dr. Pfeffer enjoys<br />\nand promotes class discussion. However, Dr.<br />\nPfeffer thoroughly examines both comment and<br />\npapers. He provides very comprehensive and<br />\nconstructive criticism of students' work. The<br />\nreadings tend to be more than extensive, often<br />\nrather difficult. The general consensus is the<br />\ncourse involves an immense amount of work,<br />\nbut if you have any interest in China, the<br />\ncourse is profitable.<br /><br />\nPSYCHOLOGY<br />\n20.1 INTRO TO LEARNING<br />\nDrs. Hulse &amp; Egeth<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n23/44<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Although billed as an introductory course, many students without previous exposure to psychology found this course<br />\ntoo complex for the beginner. The majority rated it to be a practical and empirical approach<br />\nto learning and memory concepts, but were<br />\nsuprised that they dealt mainly with learning in<br />\nrats. Some students found the text, co-authored<br />\nby the professor, to be tedious and outdated,<br />\nbut most felt that his lectures clarified the text<br />\nwell. The professor's sense of humor helped<br />\nmany a student through occasionally boring lecture topics.<br />\nWork outside the class consisted of 3-5 hours<br />\nof reading weekly, with the final grade depending upon a quiz and final. Students found both<br />\nthe work and two-credit allocation fair.

One of the complaints<br />\nraised by the students, however, was the inadequacy of the text, but Dr. Torgerson has said it<br />\nwill be changed for next term. The majority of<br />\nthe students in the class were psychology majors and this course was a major requirement.<br />\nThe work required per week was roughly three<br />\nhours and was not too difficult, but Professor<br />\nTorgerson is planning on more homework assignments for next term.<br />\nThe responding students believed this course<br />\nwas informative and practical. In the words of<br />\none student, \"It showed how statistical methods could be applied to psychology and education far better than the too theoretical calculus.\" The grading of the -course was received as<br />\nfair. The tests consisted of three to four examinations, each having a one-hour closed book<br />\nportion and an open book portion which was<br />\ntake home. The grading was based on these<br />\ntests. Dr. Torgerson stated that there was no<br />\ncurve used in his course and ordinarily about<br />\none-half of the class receives A's or B's.<br /><br />\n20.32 DEVELOPMENTAL<br />\nPSYCHOLOGY<br />\nDr. Ainsworth<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n33<br />\n21<br />\n23<br />\n17<br />\n95<br />\n62<br />\n/95<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was rated a<br />\ngood introduction to psychology, a must for<br />\nprospective psych, majors. The readings were<br />\nfairly long, and the Piaget was universally regarded as tedious. The lectures were considered<br />\na good addition to the readings, but a big long<br />\n(95 min.). The grading was considered fair, but<br />\nsome mentioned \"trivia.\" The course requires a<br />\npaper.<br /><br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n11<br />\n11<br />\n2<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: Although there were only<br />\ntwo respondents, this freshman seminar was<br />\nhighly recommended by both. They found Dr.<br />\nGarvey an excellent professor who was interested in his student, and always willing to help.<br />\nHowever, at times he was difficult to find outside of class. The requirements were one individual paper and presentation, one group paper,<br />\nand a small amount of general reading which<br />\nwas considered good. The students felt no problems with grading or competition. Although<br />\nthe respondents' majors were both in the natural sciences, they indicated that due to this<br />\ncourse and Dr. Garvey, they plan to take more<br />\npsychology courses.<br /><br />\n20.41 INTRODUCTION TO<br />\nPHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY<br />\nDr. Olton<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n4<br />\n20<br />\n26<br />\n28<br />\n78<br />\n56/78<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: This course will explore<br />\nthe areas of physiological psychology where it<br />\nis possible to interrelate the organization of behavior with the integrative action of the<br />\nnervous system. The underlying assumption of<br />\nthe course is that man's psyche and his soma<br />\nare closely interrelated, so that understanding<br />\nthe organization of man's biological characteristics should help us understand his behavior, and<br />\nvice versa.<br />\nThe topics that will be covered include sensation, perception, motor coordination, learning,<br />\nmotivation, and cognitive processes. The course<br />\nis given for both \"S\" and \"N.<br />\n'credit since it<br />\ncombines both the psychological and the biological approaches to the study of behavior. No<br />\nprerequisites are necessary.<br />\nThere will be two hourly exams and a final,<br />\nwith the final contributing about 50% to the<br />\ncourse grade.<br />\nStudent Evaluation: The course was enthusiastically recommended by all responding, with<br />\nthe catch that the work was demanding. Many<br />\ntook it as a first psych course, and were not at<br />\na disadvantage. The lectures were highly rated,<br />\nas well as the texts. The grading was strict but<br />\nfair. A good course if you want to work.

The<br />\nreadings are excellent \u2014 the best part of the<br />\ncourse \u2014 but may require as much as 10 hours<br />\na week in time. Dr. Preston grades on the basis<br />\nof a midterm (40%) and a final (60%), and an<br />\ni<br /><br />\nPage 16<br /><br />\nTHE COURSE GUIDE<br /><br />\noptional term paper. The student responding<br />\nfound the tests overly subjective and lacking a<br />\ngood grade distribution. Dr. Preston notes that<br />\nthis is a specialized, theoretical course in<br />\npsycholinguistics so, while there are no formal<br />\nprerequisites, this should not be taken as a first<br />\ncourse in psychology. He also states his intention to cut the number of journal reading<br />\ns<br />\nfrom 25 to about 20.<br /><br />\nments on the papers didn't help in comprehension, but the papers were judged to be a good<br />\nlearning experience overall. The readings for the<br />\ncourse were good, but a few felt they were unnecessary as long as the lectures were attended.<br />\n(This review is reprint from a previous review<br />\nof the professor and course.)<br /><br />\n20.343 PHYSIOLOGY OF<br />\nMOTIVATION Dr. Blass<br /><br />\n'20.315 TEST THEORY AND<br />\nAPPLICATIONS Dr. Stanley<br /><br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nGraduage<br />\nTOTAL .<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO.<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: The emphasis will be on<br />\ntechnical, theoretical, and practical aspects of<br />\nthe reliability and validity of psychological test<br />\nscores, particularly as set forth in Part 3, \"Measurement Theory,\" of the handbook entitled<br />\nEducational Measurement (Robert L. Thomdike, Ed., American Council on Education,<br />\n1971). Chapters there are \"The Nature of Measurement,\" by Lyle V. Jones; \"Reliability,\" by<br />\nJulian C.

Students will be encouraged to<br />\nlearn the fundamental techniques for doing<br />\nthis. There will be a midterm and a final examination, but no term paper.<br /><br />\n20.333 COGNITIVE<br />\nDEVELOPMENT Dr. Webb,<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. Webb is definitely a<br />\nfriendly and enthusiastic teacher. Most students<br />\ncomplained, however, that he seemed to be unprepared for his lectures. Furthermore, the lectures tended to be delivered in a rambling manner and were not well-organized. Dr. Webb was,<br />\nhowever, receptive to student questions and<br />\nideas. (This review was taken from past material on other courses taught by Dr. Webb.)<br /><br />\n20.334 MORAL<br />\nDEVELOPMENT<br /><br />\nSOCIAL<br />\nRELATIONS<br />\n23.17 VIOLENCE IN<br />\nCONTEMPORARY SOCIETY<br />\nDr. MeDill<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\nEntwistle has been her up-to-date knowledge of<br />\nthe material and her clear (albeit at times somewhat disorganized) presentations. The only hesitation's which students have had concerning Dr.<br />\nEntwistle have been that class has been held over too frequently and questions have been fielded too infrequently.

Despite what most<br />\nstudents termed a boring start, the general response was excellent. Most students thought<br />\nthe course was informative and thoughtprovoking. The semester's work, which required<br />\nabout 3 hours a week, consisted of a seminar<br />\npresentation', a short research paper, and much<br />\nreading... Students did complain about the overuse of statistical information, but all were'<br />\npleased with McDill's presentations. \"The professor seemed interested in the subject matter;<br />\nextremely knowledgable, and was always willing<br />\nto answer and discuss questions. Almost all the<br />\nstudents recommended it to future freshmen.<br /><br />\n23.57 SOCIAL INTERACTION<br />\nDrs.

On the whole, student<br />\ns<br />\nfound this course fairly interesting, especia<br />\nlly<br />\nthe extensive reading that was required. The<br />\ngrade is decided entirely by a take-home<br />\nfinal,<br />\nwhich Dr. Gordon described as \"difficult.\" Students did complain of Dr. Gordon's lack of<br />\nobjectivity and the specificity of the lectures. \"He<br />\nwas interested, but mostly in his own ideas. He<br />\nanswered questions and all that but rambled<br />\naround the subject all semester,\" a student<br />\ncommented. Some were reluctant to recommend it, but others did, mainly because of the<br />\nchallenging reading list.<br /><br />\nWRITING<br />\nSEMINARS<br /><br />\n13<br />\n13<br />\n11/13<br /><br />\nProfessor's Statement: This freshman seminar<br />\nfocuses on sociological, psychological, and biological explanations of individual and collective<br />\nviolence in contemporary America. A substantial amount of reading is involved, and regular<br />\nattendance and participation in class discussions<br />\nare expected. A research paper (20-25 pages)<br />\nwill be required in lieu of a final exam.<br /><br />\nDr. Hogan<br />\nStudent Evaluation: This course was well-liked<br />\nfor its informal and sometimes jovial classroom<br />\natmosphere and Dr. Hogan's personality and<br />\ncommanding knowledge of the subject matter.<br />\nLectures were judged to be the best part of the<br />\ncourse and essential for a good grade. The instructor's ability to lead discussions was commented upon although some felt he avoided answering good questions. Grading is based solely<br />\non two ten page papers which were Oven on<br />\nmoderately interesting topics and required a<br />\nconsiderable amount of work.

The work<br />\nload was considered appropriate, and not overly<br />\ndifficult. It consisted mainly of articles from<br />\njournals, with no assigned text. The lectures<br />\nwere considered excellent and grading fair.<br />\nMost students recommended the course in general and Dr. Blass in particular.<br /><br />\n20.332 SOCIAL COGNITION<br />\nDr. DeSoto<br />\nStudent Evaluation: Dr. DeSoto, although extremely knowledgeable in his field, is a very<br />\npoor teacher. 1-lis 'lectures are generally rambling, boring, and totally unorganized, and were<br />\nconsidered to be the worst part of the course.<br />\nHowever, Dr. DeSoto is an excellent discussion<br />\nleader and initiates and encourages student activity in class. The reading for the course involved three paperback books. These were generally ambiguous, complicated and unnecessarily difficult, but those students in the class truly<br />\ninterested in. the field of 'social psychology<br />\nthought them interesting and worth the effort.<br />\nA short paper was required; this was nothing<br />\nmore than a one or two page summary of a<br />\njournal article. The final exam, which consisted<br />\nof short essay questions, constituted the entire<br />\ngrade for the course; this practice was universally condemned. The grading, however, was very<br />\nfair, with most students receiving at least a B.<br />\nIn summary, any student considering this<br />\ncourse should realize Dr. DeSoto's limitations<br />\nas a lecturer and actually be interested in the<br />\nsubject matter.<br />\n(This is a reprintfrom a<br />\nprevious review of this professor and course.)<br /><br />\nSpring 1973<br /><br />\n22.303 PROBLEM DRAMA<br />\nDr. Arellano<br />\nCourse Distribution (by class):<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSophomore<br />\nJunior<br />\nSenior<br />\nTOTAL<br />\nRESPONSE RATIO<br /><br />\n2<br />\n15/2<br /><br />\nStudent Evaluation: This is Hopkins' only dra-1<br />\nma course, and its students only wish the0<br />\nwere more like it.
