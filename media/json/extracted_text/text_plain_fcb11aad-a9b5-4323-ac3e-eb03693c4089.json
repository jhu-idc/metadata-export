The<br />\naction was taken in a Council<br />\nmeeting Sunday night, a meeting<br />\nwhich, in the words of Council<br />\n?resident George Connolly \"was<br />\nunderstood to be closed,\" even<br />\nthough \"officially nothing was<br />\nsaid.\"<br />\nThe problems with the<br />\nelection centered around the<br />\nactions of the Student Council<br />\nmembers who took ballot box<br />\nduty. According to Tom Messana, the Council member in<br />\ncharge of the election, not<br />\nenough people volunteered for<br />\nbox duty, and some volunteers<br />\nproved to be unreliable. Council<br />\nSecretary Sid Goodfriend described an experience he had last<br />\nWednesday, when he had ballot<br />\nbox duty in the MSE library<br />\nfrom 3 to 6 P.M. When his time<br />\n' was up no one arrived to take<br />\n<br />\n\"I hope you crucify us<br />\non this one\"<br />\n-Sid Goodfriend<br />\nover the box, so after some<br />\nphone calls he left the box with<br />\nthe library desk and went to<br />\ndinner.<br />\nThe ballot box was never<br />\nleft by itself but was rather<br />\nplaced in the hands of staff<br />\nmembers of the library, Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop or The Union Desk.<br />\nWhenever the box was out of the<br />\nhands of a Council member the<br />\nblank ballots were removed by the last<br />\nmember to have it so as to<br />\n<br />\nreduce the chance of ballot<br />\nstuffing.<br />\nAnother problem of even<br />\ngreater importance was confusion over just who had voted.<br />\nThere were also serious problems<br />\nwith the ways in which voter<br />\nidentification was checked and<br />\nmultiple voting was prevented.<br />\nAccording to Messana, because the Student Directory had<br />\nnot yet been distributed, the<br />\nFreshman Record was used as a<br />\nlist of freshman names. This<br />\ncaused many problems because<br />\nthe Record is unofficial and only<br />\nhas the names of 70 per cent of<br />\nthe freshmen.<br />\nThe same copy of the<br />\nRecord was used during the<br />\nprimary, so by the time of the<br />\ngeneral elections many names<br />\nalready had check marks next to<br />\nthem, resulting in confusion over<br />\nhow to mark off those who had<br />\nvoted in the run-off. Messana<br />\nleft instructions \u2022to just put an<br />\n\"X\" next to the name of anyone<br />\nwho voted.<br />\nFor those who didn't have<br />\ntheir names in the book a list<br />\nwas started in the back with just<br />\ntheir names written down.<br />\nHowever this had already been<br />\ndone for some in the primary<br />\nelection, and the lists became<br />\nvery confusing, especially when<br />\nsome people manning the ballot<br />\nbox took to simply writing<br />\ndown the name of anyone who<br />\nvoted. Students could easily<br />\nhave voted twice, since there<br />\nwere two lists.<br />\nWhat caused the final decision to declare the election<br />\ninvalid was the fact that the<br />\ncopy of the Record with all the<br />\nname lists was lost, so that these<br />\nproblems couldn't even be<br />\nchecked.<br />\nStudent Council Vice-President Barbara Squires recalled<br />\nthat members were unable to<br />\n<br />\ndiscover the immediate location<br />\nof the Record late Thursday<br />\nnight when the first real questioning began of how the election had been run. Messana<br />\nrecalled that he first discovered<br />\nhe could not find it when he<br />\nstarted looking for it before the<br />\nmeeting<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nSunday.<br />\nAll the Student Council<br />\nmembers reached for comment<br />\nsaid that the election had to be<br />\ninvalidated when it was found<br />\nthat the Record was gone. ,<br />\nAnother minor problem<br />\nwith the election was that Paul<br />\nRosen's name was left off the',2,<br />\nballot.

Connolly said no official<br />\naction could be taken without a<br />\nCouncil meeting. However, he<br />\nalso felt that it was important to<br />\ntake action quickly. Accordingly, the News-Letter was told that<br />\nthe election had been declared<br />\ninvalid.<br />\nGoodfriend said part of the<br />\nreason for the quick action was<br />\nto head off protests over the<br />\nway the e.'3ction had been<br />\nconducted. Connolly stated that<br />\npart of the reason was a desire to<br />\navoid postponing the announcement until Sunday, which was<br />\nthe earliest time that a Student<br />\nCouncil meeting would have<br />\nbeen possible.<br />\nFriday morning at about<br />\n:00 A.M.Messana went around<br />\n1.<br />\nthe dorms informing the candidates. The candidates promptly<br />\n<br />\nwrote and signed a petition<br />\nasking that the election stand as is.<br />\nAccording to Connolly, the<br />\nCouncil did not do as the<br />\npetition asked for two reasons.<br />\nFirst, the freshmen did not<br />\nknow of all the difficulties the<br />\nelection had encountered (in<br />\nfact the petition only mentioned<br />\nthe missing hours as a reason for<br />\ninvalidating the election). Second, the Council wanted to<br />\nmaintain its own integrity when<br />\nit saw how badly the election<br />\nhad gone.<br />\nSunday the Student Council<br />\nvoted to hold a new election and<br />\nto place Barbara Squires in<br />\ncharge of it. Connolly said he<br />\nwanted no slip-ups and was<br />\nprepared to run the election<br />\nhimself, but Squires volunteered<br />\nand Connolly placed his faith in<br />\nher. Squires said it was a series<br />\nof minor difficulites that had<br />\nundermined the last election.<br />\nThe only changes Squires is<br />\nmaking involve moving more<br />\nballot boxes into the dorm area<br />\nand putting poll locations and<br />\ntimes on the posters.

Tom Messana's<br />\nslapstick ballot-box shell game vied with the mono<br />\noutbreak in Baker for belly laugh of the week. It must be<br />\nrather hard on the freshmen to find themselves assaulted<br />\nby the Council's bumbling and an infectious disease all at<br />\nthe same time. At least the Frosh candidates have<br />\nlearned early on that the \"high political drama\" on this<br />\ncampus usually resembles a Comedy of Errors or Theater<br />\nof the Absurd. Anyway, while we're waiting for Godot<br />\nto count, or recount, or find the ballots, we should begin<br />\nto take a serious look at the question of campus elections<br />\nand referendums in general.<br />\nThe Council has wisely decided neither to endorse<br />\nnor dismiss the Nestle boycott by itself, referring the<br />\nissue to the whole student body instead. This is a definite improvement in judgement over two years ago, when<br />\nfeeble-minded Council member cum Young Trustee Stu<br />\nDavidson (we wouldn't trust him with a broom, much<br />\nless investments) endorsed the coal miner's strike in the<br />\nname of the University without consulting the students.<br />\nThe Council's current action on the Nestle question,<br />\nhowever, is proper. The alleged exploitation of third-world infants is an important moral question, and, if the<br />\nallegations are indeed true, then a boycott is a good (if<br />\nlargely symbolic) manner in which to express our condemnation.<br />\nThere is a potential problem involved with this<br />\npolicy, however. As we said, the Nestle issue is real<br />\nenough, but it opens the door to those who would abuse<br />\nthe Council's precarious position. We can't have every<br />\ntwo-bit wacko organization on campus demanding that<br />\nthe Council call a general referendum over any who-cares<br />\nissue they happen to be hot under the collar about. After<br />\nall, it's hard enough to get Hopkins people off of D-level<br />\nlong enough to vote on matters which directly concern<br />\nthem, much less on whether all campus dogs should be<br />\nregistered with Major Larkin.<br />\nThe best way for the Council to avoid such difficulties is to hold well publicized, open meetings whenever<br />\nthey are asked to sponsor such a referendum. The issue<br />\nshould be the importanee of the question involved and<br />\nnot\u2014we repeat--not, the \"personalities\" of its backers.<br />\nStudent input is vital to such issues, and should not be<br />\nshut out by closed doors.<br />\nIf this week's fiasco is any indication, the Keystone<br />\nKouncil will need all the help it can get running any<br />\nsubsequent elections.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nDue to the mysterious<br />\nmachinations of Campus<br />\nMail, the News-Letter received a letter from Sid Goodfriend last week which was<br />\nmailed seven weeks ago.

It can be<br />\na serious problem.\"<br />\nBerlin said that male victims<br />\nof assault \"probably receive<br />\nmore harrassment than anyone<br />\nelse. Men are just horrified at the<br />\nidea of going to court. The<br />\npolice will probably be very<br />\nskeptical. There is not that<br />\nunderstanding that there would<br />\nbe with the female victim.\"<br />\nWenck's remarks focused on<br />\nthe legal definition and implications of rape, types of assailants<br />\nand the responses of the victim.<br />\nHe disagreed with Berlin's contention that the victim should be<br />\nangry. \"If you think you should<br />\nbe angry because you were<br />\nraped-this just perpetuates one<br />\nof the myths. Rape goes with<br />\npillage and plunder and violence.<br />\nCurrent research suggests that<br />\nrape has very little to do with<br />\nsexuality and provocativeness. It<br />\nhas to do with anger, power and<br />\nsadism.\"<br />\n<br />\nHe said that in 1978 499<br />\nrapes were reported in Baltimore; and this figure represents<br />\nonly an estimated 20% of all<br />\nthose that took place.<br />\nBasing his remarks on research conducted with victims<br />\nand convicted assailants by Boston College professor Ann Burgess, .Wenck identified three<br />\ntypes of rapists. The most<br />\ndangerous is the sadistic rapist,<br />\nwho selects victims of -any age<br />\nand for whom violence, not<br />\nsexual satisfaction, is the primary purpose of the assault. \"In<br />\nsuch cases, I won't tell you to<br />\nfight back, to get angry. The<br />\nvictim is lucky to come out<br />\nalive.\"<br />\nAccording to Wenck, one<br />\nparticular type of rapist is the<br />\nmost difficult to convict.\"When<br />\nthe issue is that the rapist uses<br />\nonly that force necessary to<br />\novercome your will--things come<br />\ndown to an estimation of what<br />\nthat force used must be in that<br />\nparticular case.\"<br />\nWenck defined rape according to law, as \"forcible vaginal<br />\nintercourse.\" He distinguished<br />\nbetween categories of rape and<br />\nseverity of sentences imposed in<br />\nterms of type of assault and<br />\n<br />\ndegree of force used.<br />\nHe described two common<br />\ndefenses alleged assailants make<br />\nto the charge of rape. If the<br />\nvictim and the attacker are<br />\nstrangers, the assailant may<br />\nplead mistaken identity: If the<br />\ntwo are acquainted, the legal<br />\nresponse might be to construe<br />\ntlfat the woman had somehow<br />\nbeen provocative, that she was<br />\nstupid enough to place herself in<br />\na situation the danger of which<br />\nshe should have been aware.<br />\n\"This is one of the myths about<br />\nrape that we have to exorcise.\"<br />\nBenson began by listing the<br />\nservices offered by the Center<br />\nfor Victims of Sexual Assault.<br />\nThe Center operates a 24-hour<br />\nhotline at 366-RAPE for confidential counseling to victims and<br />\ntheir families. Upon request,<br />\nthey accompany victims through<br />\nhospital and court procedures.<br />\nBenson said that three Baltimore city hospitals have specialized facilities to cope with<br />\nvictims of assault: City, Mercy<br />\nand University. He urged all<br />\nvictims to go to a hospital as<br />\nquickly as possible after an<br />\nattack. Besides obtaining treatment, the victim is examined for<br />\nevidence that can be used should<br />\n<br />\nhe decide to prosecute his<br />\nattacker.<br />\nHe discussed what happens<br />\nto victims and their friends and<br />\nfamilies as a result of assaut and<br />\nways that those close to the<br />\nvictim can help. Common emotional and physiological responses to assault include an<br />\ninitial calmness comparable to a<br />\nstate of shock; disturbance of<br />\nsleep and eating patterns; phobic<br />\nfears of crowds or dark places;<br />\nand paralysis from fear. \"You're<br />\nresponding to the threat of being<br />\nkilled. But there's something<br />\nmore. There's the added dimension of sexuality--along with .fear<br />\nof humiliation, degradation,<br />\nguilt, shame, embarrassment, desire for revenge.\"<br />\nBenson emphasized the seriousness which long-term effects<br />\nof an assault may have for<br />\nrelationships between the victim<br />\nand a spouse or lover. They<br />\ninclude the inability of the<br />\nvictim to resume sexual activity;<br />\ninability of wife and husband<br />\nto even talk about the attack;<br />\njealousy, and the breakup of<br />\nmarriages and relationships. He<br />\nsaid that \"often spouses and<br />\nlovers blame themselves for not<br />\npreventing the attack or the<br />\n<br />\nvictim for being a victim.\"<br />\n\"Nobody comes to an assault in a vacuum.

However, if the Student Council feels<br />\nstrongly about this issue, it<br />\nshould itself endorse the boycott, rather than referring the<br />\nmatter to the student body<br />\nas a whole. Most of us know<br />\nlittle about the issue of this<br />\nreferendum, the sales practices<br />\nof Nestle Co. in underdeveloped<br />\ncountries. The Student Council<br />\ncould make a more intelligent<br />\ndecision on this issue than we<br />\ncan, since it presumably would<br />\nmake such a decision only after<br />\nresearching the issue, hearing<br />\nboth sides of it, and debating it.<br />\nMost members of the student<br />\nbody understandably lack the<br />\ntime and inclination to find out<br />\nenough about this matter to<br />\nmake an intelligent decision.<br />\nFrom what I have heard about<br />\nNestle's sales practices in underdeveloped countries, which has<br />\nbeen from the supporters of this<br />\nboycott, they seem very bad<br />\nindeed. However, before I could<br />\nendorse such a boycott, I would<br />\nhave to find out more about the<br />\nissue: not only about Nestle's<br />\n<br />\nsales practices, but also about<br />\nwho organized this world-wide<br />\nboycott, and why this Swiss<br />\ncorporation was singled out to<br />\nbe boycotted, rather than other<br />\ncorporations, which, according<br />\nto the supporters of this boycott, have similar unsavory sales<br />\npractices. The students should,<br />\nby voting no in next week's<br />\nreferendum, tell the Student<br />\nCouncil, and the supporters of<br />\nthis boycott, that they will not<br />\ngive their support to projects<br />\nand purposes they know little<br />\nabout.<br />\nJoseph Hammerman<br />\n<br />\nG.R.O.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is the position of the<br />\nGraduate Representative Organization that the Chaplain's Office<br />\nprovides a worthwhile service to<br />\nthe Hopkins community and we<br />\nactively support its efforts<br />\nOne vital aspect of a university education entails the exposure to broad social issues.

Intelligent<br />\ndecisions are made when one<br />\nthoroughly examines opposing<br />\nviewpoints and chooses between<br />\nthem. The Office of the Chaplain strives to give alternate<br />\nviews the exposure and attention<br />\nthey deserve.<br />\nWe are constantly being<br />\n<br />\ndeluged with conservative viewpoints from the faculty and the<br />\nadministration. I find the very<br />\nnature of my pre-professional<br />\npreparation gears me towards<br />\nthe conservative tendencies of<br />\nmy future career. Therefore I<br />\nwelcome the activities of the<br />\nOffice of the Chaplain as a<br />\nbreath of fresh air.

In case<br />\nMr. Einolf is interested, I am not<br />\na \"radical on full scholarship,\" I<br />\nam not affiliated with any<br />\nspecific organizations on campus<br />\n(especially not the Chaplain's<br />\nOffice); I am just a student who<br />\nhappens to care about the moral<br />\nstate of our society and who<br />\nappreciates the change of view-<br />\n<br />\npoint presented by the Chaplain's Office and I wish all my<br />\ntuition dollars which are paid<br />\nalone by my family were to go<br />\nto such worthy groups.<br />\nJulie Davies '80<br />\n<br />\nMoney<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nLetters have piled into the<br />\nN-L Office accusing me of being<br />\na heartless beast with a mind for<br />\nonly money.

I have to get<br />\nalong with a vocabulary of about fifteen hundred<br />\nserviceable words that I just Use over and over again,<br />\ntrying to rearrange them in an interesting order. Sid is<br />\nlike a Roxy organ that has three decks,fifty stops, and a<br />\npride of pedals under the bench. When he wants a<br />\nword, it's there. Sid even speaks with precision--a feat<br />\nmany a writer is incapable of.. In the realm of satire,<br />\nparody, and burlesque, he has, from the beginning,<br />\nbowed to none.<br />\n<br />\nCorset and Underwear Review displayed next to the<br />\nAmerican Bee JournaL However, newsstands make<br />\nstrange bedfellows, as anyone who has ever slept with a<br />\nnewsstand can testify, and if you think about it at all<br />\n(instead of sitting there in a torpor with your mouth<br />\nhalf-open) you'd see this proximity is not only alphabetical. Both the Corset and Underwear Review and the<br />\nAmerican Bee Journal are concerned with honeys;<br />\nalthough I am beast enough to prefer a photograph ofa<br />\nsucculent nymph in a satin Lastex Girdleiere with Thrill<br />\nPlus Bra to the most dramatic snapshot of an apiary,<br />\neach has its place in my scheme.\"<br />\n<br />\n--E.B. White,1968<br />\n<br />\nAs evidenced by the countless puns and allusions<br />\nthat permeate his writing, Perelman was a well-read man.<br />\nHis favorite authors were James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, H.L.<br />\nMencken, W. Somerset. Maugham and Charles Dickens.<br />\nIndeed, many of his characters bear mock-Dickensian<br />\nnames like Urban Sprawl, architect; Hawfinch and<br />\nMealwoi-in, tailors; Howells and Imprecation, lawyers;<br />\nWhitelipped and Trembling, brokers; Chalky Aftertaste<br />\nand His Musical Poltroons, a ragtime band; Sir Hamish<br />\nSphincter, a British diplomat; Arpad Fustian, \"the rug<br />\nchandler\"; Larszny, a Hungarian pianist; Lucas Membrande and Marcel Riboflavin, the French police inspector in the case of \"The Saucier's Apprentice.\"<br />\nSometimes the titles of Perelman's essays are as<br />\nfunny as the essays themselves. A glance at the table of<br />\ncontents of Crazy Like A Fox (formerly published as<br />\nThe Best of S.J. Perelman) reveals: \"A Farewell to<br />\nOmsk,\" \"A Pox On You, Mine Goodly Host,\" \"Midwinter Facial Trends,\" \"Beat Me, Post-Impressionist<br />\nDaddy,\" \"Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer,\" and \"Well,<br />\nRoll Me In A Turkish Towel!\"<br />\n\"The titles lent themselves to plagiarism,\" the<br />\nNew York Times pointed out in a front page obituary,<br />\n\"but Mr. Perelman was generous. In an interview,<br />\nhe once said that he was writing his autobiography,and<br />\nwould call it 'Smiling, the Boy Fell Dead.' A play<br />\npromptly opened under that name. Thereafter, he said<br />\nhis autobiography would be called 'The Hindsight Saga.'\"<br />\n<br />\nE.B. White, the great American essayist, must be<br />\nfeeling awfully lonesome these days at his home on the<br />\ncoast of Maine. At 80, White is one of a vanishing breed<br />\nof writers who met and became friends while working on<br />\na struggling new weekly called The New Yorker. Their<br />\nprose--graceful but simple, sophisticated but straightforward\u2014most often dealt with the humor that arose<br />\nfrom life's more uncomfortable and ironic situations.<br />\nFifty years later, nearly all the creators of that style of<br />\nprose are gone: James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Frank<br />\nSullivan, Dorothy Parker, John McNulty, and now S.J.<br />\nPerelman, who died last week at the age of 75.<br />\nAny encyclopedia would put these writers under<br />\nthe sub-category of \"humorist,\" but, as Thurber cautioned, \"To call such people 'humorists,' a loose-fitting<br />\nand ugly word, is to miss the nature of their dilemma<br />\nand the dilemma of their nature. The little wheels of<br />\ntheir invention are set in motion by the damp hand of<br />\nmelancholy.\"<br />\nLike his colleagues at The New Yorker, Perelman<br />\nwas a sedate person who made a career out of writing<br />\ncomic pieces. \"He was utterly serious, but his medium<br />\nsimply was humor,\" remarked William Shawn, the<br />\nmagazine's current editor. \"He was widely appreciated<br />\nas a humorist, but people were so enormously entertained by him that they sometimes overlooked his great<br />\noriginality and his literary brilliance.\"<br />\nThough not necessarily a cut above his cohorts<br />\non The New Yorker, Perelman was a cut apart--more<br />\nbiting, more vitriolic, and often funnier. \"Generally<br />\nspeaking,\" he once said in an interview,\"I don't believe<br />\nin kindly humor--I don't think it exists. One of the most<br />\nshameful utterances to stem from the human mouth is<br />\nWill Rogers's 'I never met a man I didn't like.' The<br />\nabsolute antithesis is Oscar Wilde on the kodiunting<br />\nEnglishman: `The unspeakable in full pursuit of the<br />\nuneatable.' W\"-w- remark contains, in briefest span, the<br />\ntruth, whereas kub.....; s is pure flatulence, crowd-pleasing<br />\n<br />\nand fake humility.\"<br />\nSidney Joseph Perelman was born in Brooklyn<br />\non Feb. 1, 1904, and grew up in Providence, R.I. While<br />\nhis father worked unsuccessfully as a machinist, a<br />\ndry-goods merchant, and a poultry farmer, the boy<br />\ncrammed his mind with the popular novels and movies<br />\nof the era. His ambition was to be a cartoonist. He<br />\npracticed on the cardboard boxes his father brought<br />\nhome from the dry-goods store, and later, at Brown<br />\nUniversity, Perelman drew cartoons for the college<br />\nhumor magazine. Following his graduation in 1924, he<br />\nlanded a job with the humor weekly,Judge.<br />\nPerelman worked as a cartoonist for several years<br />\nuntil he noticed that the captions were getting longer<br />\nand longer. They eventually replaced the cartoons and<br />\nbecame the prototype of the essay with which he would<br />\nlater earn his reputation.<br />\nWhite observed that Perelman's pieces \"usually<br />\nhad a lead sentence, or lead paragraph, that was as<br />\nhair-raising as the first big dip on a roller coaster: it got<br />\nyou in the stomach, and when it was over you were<br />\nrelieved to feel deceleration setting in.\" An essay entitled \"Beauty and the Bee\" features just such an opening:<br />\n\"It is always something ofa shock to approach a<br />\nnewsstand which handles trade publications and find the<br />\n<br />\nI was collaborating with S.J. Perelman on Monkey Business. We had a difference of opinion on a line.<br />\nHe said, \"If you repeat that, I'll throw you out<br />\nthe window,\" whereupon, somewhat theatrically, I'll<br />\nadmit, I rose from my chair and walked to the window.<br />\n\"I thought I'd make it easier for you.\"<br />\nThis bit of youghful bravado was not a demonstration of courage. I knew for a fact that Perelman had<br />\nnever thrown anyone out ofa window and I was reasonably certain that I was not going to be the first.<br />\nBesides, the window was on the first floor.<br />\n--Arthur Sheekman<br />\n<br />\nGroucho with the-writers ofMonkey Business, counter-clockwise: Groucho (shading eyes),<br />\nSol Violinsky, Perelman, Will Johnstone, and Arthur Sheekman.<br />\n<br />\nMost people have met the Perelman style through<br />\nthe screenplays for Around the World in 80 Days and<br />\ntwo classic Marx Brothers movies, Monkey Business and<br />\nHorse Feathers. Perelman's scenario for Around the<br />\nWorld won him an Oscar, but his involvement with the<br />\nMarx Brothers proved somewhat less rewarding.<br />\nGroucho Marx met Perelman in 1930 and asked<br />\nhim to come to Hollywood to work on the Marx's next<br />\nfilm. At first the two men struck up a friendship and<br />\neven formed a small organization of scenarists called The<br />\nWest Side Writing and Asthma Club (Perelman's title).<br />\nBut then, as Groucho put it, \"things changed.\" Despite<br />\nmaking what most critics call the major contributions to<br />\nthe screenplays for Monkey Business and Horse<br />\nFeathers, Perelman left Tinsel Town, embittered over<br />\nthe chopping up of his scripts. After Perelman wrote a<br />\ncaustic article about the experience (with unkind comments aimed at Groucho in particular), his feud with<br />\nMarx hit full throttle.<br />\nNat Perrin, another collaborator on Monkey<br />\nBusiness, said, \"I can't remember exactly what Perelman<br />\nwrote about but it was most unflattering in, as I recall<br />\nnow, a more or less personal way. I was shocked when I<br />\nread it because I always felt there was a very warm<br />\npersonal feeling between them...1 had mentioned it to<br />\nGrouch() and had no idea how hurt, angry and bitter he<br />\nwas about it.\"<br />\nFrom then on, the relationship between Perelman and Groucho was cautious at best. Later, the two<br />\n<br />\n\fwere heard together on a radio interview with Kenneth<br />\nTynan (\"Tynan thought it would be great,\" Grouch()<br />\nrecalled. \"having both me and Perelman on his show. It<br />\nended up being the dullest fucking interview there ever<br />\nwas. Perelman was trying to outdo me and I was trying<br />\nto outdo him and we both stunk...\"), and around 1960,<br />\nPerelman sent a photograph of himself to Marx. It was<br />\ninscribed: \"To Groucho, in memory of our many<br />\ncampaigns in the Sudan.\"<br />\nGroucho nonetheless maintained that Perelman<br />\nwas \"a son of a bitch with a head as big as my desk,\"<br />\nand Perelman would one day recollect, \"I did two films<br />\nwith them, which in its way is perhaps my greatest<br />\ndistinction in life, because anybody who ever worked on<br />\nany picture for the Marx Brothers said he would rather<br />\nbe chained to a galley oar and lashed at ten-minute<br />\nintervals than ever work for these sons of bitches again.\"<br />\nA few years before his death, Groucho softened a little<br />\nand wrote in his pictorial autobiography, The Groucho<br />\nPhile, \"In recent years the press has concocted a feud<br />\nbetween S.J. Perelman and me, but no such feud ever<br />\nexisted. Sid has often been asked about writing for the<br />\nMarx Brothers, and I have often answered questions<br />\nabout his contributions to our films. What Sid and I<br />\nboth agree on is that he is a great writer with a brilliant<br />\ncomic mind that didn't always mesh well with the<br />\nlunacies of the Marx Brothers.\"<br />\nI believe it was Hippolyte Taine--or possibly<br />\nMonroe Taine, the tailor, a philosophical chap who used<br />\nto press my pants 40 years ago in the Village--who once<br />\nobserved that immortality is a chancy matter, subject to<br />\nthe caprice of the unborn.<br />\n--S.J. Perelman<br />\nUnlike poets, playwrights, novelists, and other<br />\nwriters of grander repute, humorists--or, in deference to<br />\nThurber, the authors of light pieces--customarily resign<br />\nthemselves to the fact that they are second-rate citizens<br />\nin the world of Literature. Typically, Perelman gave<br />\nlittle or no thought to the issue of immortality. In fact,<br />\nhe seemed to anticipate the approaching extinction of<br />\nhis genre: \"The handful of chumps who still practice it<br />\nare as lonely as the survivors of Fort Zinderneuf; a few<br />\nmore assaults by television and picture journalism and<br />\nwe might as well post their bodies on the ramparts, pray<br />\nfor togetherness, and kneel for the final annihilation.<br />\nUntil then, so long and don't take any wooden rhetoric.<br />\nIn a slightly more serious vein, William Shawn<br />\n:.ommented last week on Perelman's dedication to his<br />\ncrafi:. \"Over the years, people often put pressure on him<br />\n<br />\nFriends or foes: Groucho with one of his autobiographies,<br />\nand Perelman in the photo he sent to Marx around 1960.<br />\nto write something they considered serious-:a novel, course, he invariably used it to comic effect.\" From the<br />\nsay\u2014but he was never diverted from doing what he \u2022 New York Times: \"He had a spectacular command of<br />\napparently was born to do, which was to write short 'language, and the ability to transform the common<br />\nhumor pieces.\"<br />\ncliche\u2022or figure of speech into an exploding cigar.\"<br />\nDiscussions as to whether or not Perelman's<br />\nPerhaps Vonnegut's metaphor of the piccolo<br />\nname will endure--and if so, how long\u2014would be purely virtuoso playing 'The Stars and Stripes Forever' best<br />\nacademic (pardon the pun). For the time being, how- sums up Perelman's place in American writing. As<br />\never, the post-mortem praise is rolling in. From John anyone familiar with the renowned Sousa composition<br />\nUpdike: \"What always struck me was the way Perelman can attest, the piccolo plays an exuberant harmony<br />\nused the English language like a bolo--the way he got the counter to the famous melody which is rendered by the<br />\nlanguage whirling of its own momentum, and somehow horns. Like the powerful brass of'The Stars and Stripes<br />\nevery sentence ended in a laugh, and he'd bring the Forever,' the big names of 20th century American<br />\ntarget down.\" From Kurt Vonnegut: \"Perelman literature--Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, Bellow, et<br />\nhandled the American language the way a virtuoso al\u2014attract most of the attention, while S.J.

After experiencing this<br />\ntwo-and-one-half hour odyssey through<br />\nthe depths of the Vietnam war, an<br />\naverage viewer reacts with little more<br />\nthan numbed silence. It is a powerful,<br />\nemotionally draining film that must be<br />\nexperienced to be believed.<br />\nCoppola, the film's producer,<br />\ndirector, and co-screenwriter, summed up<br />\nhis purpose in creating this work in a<br />\nsentence: \"The film's purpose is to give<br />\nits audience a sense of the horror, the<br />\nmadness, the sensuousness, and the moral<br />\ndilemma of the Vietnam war.\" After<br />\nseeing the film twice, I can say that he<br />\nhas succeeded, but not perfectly. The<br />\nfilm has moments of spectacular artistic<br />\nsuccess as well as scenes which can only<br />\nbe described as failures.<br />\nThe story revolves around the<br />\nadventures of a Green Beret Captain<br />\nnamed Willard while on a special mission<br />\nsomewhere in South Vietnam. The role<br />\nof Willard is a difficult one, and six<br />\nwell-known actors turned down the role<br />\nbefore Martin Sheen agreed to try it.<br />\nSheen succeeds in making the characterization of Willard a credible one, with<br />\nhuman strengths and weaknesses. Captain Willard's mission is to track down<br />\nand kill another Green Beret officer,<br />\nColonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has<br />\nbeen illegally operating against the<br />\nCambodian enemy with native troops.<br />\nfrom a Navy patrol boat.<br />\nWillard searches for Kurtz along<br />\nthe rivers of Vietnam. Coppola uses the<br />\nvessel and its Crew to show the audience<br />\nas much of the war as possible. The<br />\nboat's crew is a cross-section of America's<br />\narmy. A young ghetto black, a drug-crazed California surfer, a gourmet cook from<br />\nNew Orleans, and a middle-aged Navy<br />\nlifer are all thrown together on this<br />\nminiature \"ship of fools.\" From the<br />\nunique perspective of the river, we see<br />\nvarious pieces of the war raging on<br />\n<br />\naround us; a helicopter assault on a<br />\nvillage, massacres of Vietnamese civilians,<br />\nand other similar incidents. In one of the<br />\nfilm's lighter moments, we are treated to<br />\na USO-type performance, complete with<br />\nPlayboy bunnies, at an isolated jungle<br />\noutpost. Most of the film's action takes<br />\nplace on or near the boat or its passengers.,<br />\nThroughout most of the film,<br />\na secondary role. Coppola<br />\nplays<br />\nKurtz<br />\nmakes the war -the star of the first two<br />\nhours; we meet Kurtz only in the last<br />\nsegments. When Willard and his surviving<br />\ncompanions reach Kurtz' jungle compound, the whole focus of the action<br />\nshifts to the very personal confrontation<br />\nbetween Kurtz and Willard. This change<br />\nis dramatic, radically altering the entire<br />\nmood and intensity of the film. Here the<br />\nstory takes on a surreal, almost Mystical<br />\nquality. But winding up the film afier30<br />\nor so minutes of Brando's ramblings<br />\nprovides an unsatisfying finale.<br />\nCoppola has built his reputation<br />\nas a film-maker on creating suspenseful,<br />\nactionpacked works such as The Godfather and its sequel. He is at his best<br />\nwhen staging a gunfight or battle. The<br />\nfirst two hours of Apocalypse Now is<br />\nmore or less a traditional war film,<br />\nwith gunfights and battles. It is only<br />\nwhen Coppola attempts to move the film<br />\nonto a higher intellectual plane that it<br />\nfalters. All the continuity and built-up<br />\nsuspense disappear when the final<br />\nhalf-hour sequence with Kurtz begins.<br />\nThis segment is anti-climactic, and only<br />\n<br />\n. m the rest of the film.<br />\nloosely follows fro<br />\nif Coppola had made<br />\nas<br />\nIt is almost<br />\nthe Vietnam war,<br />\nabout<br />\none<br />\n-films<br />\ntwo<br />\nthe other about Colonel Kurtz. Coppola<br />\nfilmed eight different endings to this film<br />\nand claims this is the best one: Coppola<br />\nwould do better to stick to less esoteric<br />\nsequences.<br />\nAlso, by attempting to show us as<br />\nmuch of the war as possible, Coppola<br />\nshows us too little of the more important<br />\nfacets. The war was not fought by Green<br />\n<br />\nof the ordinary US soldier in Vietnam.<br />\nSeveral minor efforts have been made in<br />\nthis direction, such as the 1977 film Boys<br />\nof Company C.

His colorful paintings had a broad<br />\ninfluence on America 1940's and 50's.<br />\nAlthough these painted abstractions are<br />\nfar better known than Hoffman's drawings, his paintings owe much of their<br />\nverve and spontaneity to drawings in<br />\n, which he continuously worked on artistic<br />\nFifty-three<br />\nproblems and solutions.<br />\nblack-and-white drawings from all phases<br />\nof Hoffman's career are being shown,<br />\n\" many for the first time, at the Baltimore<br />\n, Museum of Art through December 16.<br />\nAll Hoffman's art reflects his<br />\n<br />\nPilot Ego<br />\ncont.from p. 12<br />\npilots, and space technology, to understand and share the \"shockkkk of recognition\" with those seven who dared to<br />\npossess \"the right stuff.\"<br />\nThough most of the book concerns itself with the astronauts' ascent to<br />\nthe top of the competency pyramid, the<br />\nfirst chapter begins with the wife of a<br />\nNavy test pilot talking to another pilot's<br />\nwife on the phone. Word is that \"something's happened out there.\" Her husband<br />\nunaccounted for, Jane Conrad worries<br />\nthat Pete has been \"burned beyond<br />\nrecognition\"--in other words, turned into<br />\nwhat \"looked like an enormous fowl that<br />\nhas burned up in a stove, burned a<br />\nblackish brown all over, greasy and<br />\nblistered, fried, in a word, with not only<br />\nthe entire face and all the hair and the<br />\nears burned off, not to mention all the<br />\nclothing, but also the hands and feet,<br />\nwith what remains of the arms and legs<br />\nbent at the knees and elbows and burned<br />\ninto absolutely rigid angles...\"--while<br />\ntesting high-speed planes in the Florida<br />\nswamp of Edward's Navy base. Fortunately for Jane, and unfortunately for<br />\nLoretta, the casualty is Bud Jennings.<br />\nThus begins the ritual of the man from<br />\nthe Society for Widows and Orphans<br />\nwaiting dutifully at the door, the bridge<br />\ncoated pilots at the funeral, and the<br />\ndinner party discussions--yes, Bud had<br />\nbeen a good man, but inexperienced;<br />\n\"when the malfunction in the controls<br />\nput him in that bad corner, he didn't<br />\nknow how to get out of it.\"<br />\nThis first chapter prepares the<br />\nreader to understand the mentality of<br />\n\"the right stuff.\" According to Wolfe, the<br />\npilots would never mention death,<br />\ndanger, bravery, or fear by name; rather,<br />\nthey would use code words and examples.<br />\nFor instance, the pilot who dropped 8100<br />\nfeet and smashed into the ground when<br />\nhis parachute failed to open was killed<br />\nbecause of his own negligence in not<br />\nchecking the chute or that of his crew for<br />\nnot checking it before take-off. In short,<br />\n\"there are no accidents and no fatal flaws<br />\nin the machinery; there are only pilots<br />\nwith the wrong stuff.\" Wolfe explores<br />\nthis mentality even further with his<br />\ndescription of The Pilot Ego: \"The Pilot<br />\nEgo--ego didn't come any bigger! The<br />\nboys wouldn't have minded the following. They wouldn't have minded appearing once a year on a balcony .over a huge<br />\nsquare in which half the'world is<br />\nassembled. They wave. The world roars<br />\nits approval, its applause, and breaks into<br />\na sushined thirty-minute storm of cheers<br />\nand tears (moved by my righteous<br />\nstuff!).\" So, right means not only professional competence, but righteousness,<br />\nelevated purpose and spirituality, the<br />\nbelief that you are flying on God's<br />\nright hand side.\"A little adulation on the<br />\norder of the Pope's, that's all the True<br />\n<br />\nobservation of, and reaction to, the<br />\neveryday world. Even in his most abstract drawings, one can recognize naturalistic shapes. But he did not attempt to<br />\nimitate the formal properties of his<br />\nsubjects; rather, he translated these<br />\nproperties into the new, two-dimensional<br />\nspace through a prismatic perception.<br />\nParticularly in his landscapes, Hoffman<br />\nsimplified and grouped numerous forms,<br />\nalmost in the manner of a child's drawing,<br />\ncreating variety within them by using<br />\ndifferent brush or pencil strokes.<br />\nAs a colorist, Hoffman was<br />\nconcerned with textural surfaces on<br />\nwhich he pitted high-keyed colors against<br />\neach other. In the much more austere<br />\nand limited domain of ink and pencil, he<br />\ncompensated by developing many kinds<br />\nof marks and notations to fill space. The<br />\nmarks are energetic and chaotic; yet they<br />\nexert subtle unifying forces as they repeat<br />\nin different parts of the drawing. Hoffman used lines not only for representational outline, but also structurally. The<br />\nplacement of lines and masses is as<br />\nimportant as the subject in determining a<br />\ndrawing's character.<br />\nLandscapes dominate the period<br />\n1930-1940. Hoffman examined fields,<br />\nbeaches, city streets, furniture, and<br />\ntable-top miscellany, combining Cubist<br />\ngeometry with dynamic shadings, crosshatching, scribbling, etc. One can observe<br />\nshapes in these drawings which reappear<br />\nin his abstract paintings as fully-developed compositions.

The<br />\naction was taken in a Council<br />\nmeeting Sunday night, a meeting<br />\nwhich, in the words of Council<br />\n?resident George Connolly \"was<br />\nunderstood to be closed,\" even<br />\nthough \"officially nothing was<br />\nsaid.\"<br />\nThe problems with the<br />\nelection centered around the<br />\nactions of the Student Council<br />\nmembers who took ballot box<br />\nduty. According to Tom Messana, the Council member in<br />\ncharge of the election, not<br />\nenough people volunteered for<br />\nbox duty, and some volunteers<br />\nproved to be unreliable. Council<br />\nSecretary Sid Goodfriend described an experience he had last<br />\nWednesday, when he had ballot<br />\nbox duty in the MSE library<br />\nfrom 3 to 6 P.M. When his time<br />\n' was up no one arrived to take<br /><br />\n\"I hope you crucify us<br />\non this one\"<br />\n-Sid Goodfriend<br />\nover the box, so after some<br />\nphone calls he left the box with<br />\nthe library desk and went to<br />\ndinner.<br />\nThe ballot box was never<br />\nleft by itself but was rather<br />\nplaced in the hands of staff<br />\nmembers of the library, Gilman<br />\nCoffee Shop or The Union Desk.<br />\nWhenever the box was out of the<br />\nhands of a Council member the<br />\nblank ballots were removed by the last<br />\nmember to have it so as to<br /><br />\nreduce the chance of ballot<br />\nstuffing.<br />\nAnother problem of even<br />\ngreater importance was confusion over just who had voted.<br />\nThere were also serious problems<br />\nwith the ways in which voter<br />\nidentification was checked and<br />\nmultiple voting was prevented.<br />\nAccording to Messana, because the Student Directory had<br />\nnot yet been distributed, the<br />\nFreshman Record was used as a<br />\nlist of freshman names. This<br />\ncaused many problems because<br />\nthe Record is unofficial and only<br />\nhas the names of 70 per cent of<br />\nthe freshmen.<br />\nThe same copy of the<br />\nRecord was used during the<br />\nprimary, so by the time of the<br />\ngeneral elections many names<br />\nalready had check marks next to<br />\nthem, resulting in confusion over<br />\nhow to mark off those who had<br />\nvoted in the run-off. Messana<br />\nleft instructions \u2022to just put an<br />\n\"X\" next to the name of anyone<br />\nwho voted.<br />\nFor those who didn't have<br />\ntheir names in the book a list<br />\nwas started in the back with just<br />\ntheir names written down.<br />\nHowever this had already been<br />\ndone for some in the primary<br />\nelection, and the lists became<br />\nvery confusing, especially when<br />\nsome people manning the ballot<br />\nbox took to simply writing<br />\ndown the name of anyone who<br />\nvoted. Students could easily<br />\nhave voted twice, since there<br />\nwere two lists.<br />\nWhat caused the final decision to declare the election<br />\ninvalid was the fact that the<br />\ncopy of the Record with all the<br />\nname lists was lost, so that these<br />\nproblems couldn't even be<br />\nchecked.<br />\nStudent Council Vice-President Barbara Squires recalled<br />\nthat members were unable to<br /><br />\ndiscover the immediate location<br />\nof the Record late Thursday<br />\nnight when the first real questioning began of how the election had been run. Messana<br />\nrecalled that he first discovered<br />\nhe could not find it when he<br />\nstarted looking for it before the<br />\nmeeting<br />\nCouncil<br />\nStudent<br />\nSunday.<br />\nAll the Student Council<br />\nmembers reached for comment<br />\nsaid that the election had to be<br />\ninvalidated when it was found<br />\nthat the Record was gone. ,<br />\nAnother minor problem<br />\nwith the election was that Paul<br />\nRosen's name was left off the',2,<br />\nballot.

Accordingly, the News-Letter was told that<br />\nthe election had been declared<br />\ninvalid.<br />\nGoodfriend said part of the<br />\nreason for the quick action was<br />\nto head off protests over the<br />\nway the e.'3ction had been<br />\nconducted.

Tom Messana's<br />\nslapstick ballot-box shell game vied with the mono<br />\noutbreak in Baker for belly laugh of the week. It must be<br />\nrather hard on the freshmen to find themselves assaulted<br />\nby the Council's bumbling and an infectious disease all at<br />\nthe same time. At least the Frosh candidates have<br />\nlearned early on that the \"high political drama\" on this<br />\ncampus usually resembles a Comedy of Errors or Theater<br />\nof the Absurd. Anyway, while we're waiting for Godot<br />\nto count, or recount, or find the ballots, we should begin<br />\nto take a serious look at the question of campus elections<br />\nand referendums in general.<br />\nThe Council has wisely decided neither to endorse<br />\nnor dismiss the Nestle boycott by itself, referring the<br />\nissue to the whole student body instead. This is a definite improvement in judgement over two years ago, when<br />\nfeeble-minded Council member cum Young Trustee Stu<br />\nDavidson (we wouldn't trust him with a broom, much<br />\nless investments) endorsed the coal miner's strike in the<br />\nname of the University without consulting the students.<br />\nThe Council's current action on the Nestle question,<br />\nhowever, is proper. The alleged exploitation of third-world infants is an important moral question, and, if the<br />\nallegations are indeed true, then a boycott is a good (if<br />\nlargely symbolic) manner in which to express our condemnation.<br />\nThere is a potential problem involved with this<br />\npolicy, however. As we said, the Nestle issue is real<br />\nenough, but it opens the door to those who would abuse<br />\nthe Council's precarious position. We can't have every<br />\ntwo-bit wacko organization on campus demanding that<br />\nthe Council call a general referendum over any who-cares<br />\nissue they happen to be hot under the collar about. After<br />\nall, it's hard enough to get Hopkins people off of D-level<br />\nlong enough to vote on matters which directly concern<br />\nthem, much less on whether all campus dogs should be<br />\nregistered with Major Larkin.<br />\nThe best way for the Council to avoid such difficulties is to hold well publicized, open meetings whenever<br />\nthey are asked to sponsor such a referendum. The issue<br />\nshould be the importanee of the question involved and<br />\nnot\u2014we repeat--not, the \"personalities\" of its backers.<br />\nStudent input is vital to such issues, and should not be<br />\nshut out by closed doors.<br />\nIf this week's fiasco is any indication, the Keystone<br />\nKouncil will need all the help it can get running any<br />\nsubsequent elections.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nDue to the mysterious<br />\nmachinations of Campus<br />\nMail, the News-Letter received a letter from Sid Goodfriend last week which was<br />\nmailed seven weeks ago.

There is not that<br />\nunderstanding that there would<br />\nbe with the female victim.\"<br />\nWenck's remarks focused on<br />\nthe legal definition and implications of rape, types of assailants<br />\nand the responses of the victim.<br />\nHe disagreed with Berlin's contention that the victim should be<br />\nangry. \"If you think you should<br />\nbe angry because you were<br />\nraped-this just perpetuates one<br />\nof the myths. Rape goes with<br />\npillage and plunder and violence.<br />\nCurrent research suggests that<br />\nrape has very little to do with<br />\nsexuality and provocativeness. It<br />\nhas to do with anger, power and<br />\nsadism.\"<br /><br />\nHe said that in 1978 499<br />\nrapes were reported in Baltimore; and this figure represents<br />\nonly an estimated 20% of all<br />\nthose that took place.<br />\nBasing his remarks on research conducted with victims<br />\nand convicted assailants by Boston College professor Ann Burgess, .Wenck identified three<br />\ntypes of rapists. The most<br />\ndangerous is the sadistic rapist,<br />\nwho selects victims of -any age<br />\nand for whom violence, not<br />\nsexual satisfaction, is the primary purpose of the assault. \"In<br />\nsuch cases, I won't tell you to<br />\nfight back, to get angry. The<br />\nvictim is lucky to come out<br />\nalive.\"<br />\nAccording to Wenck, one<br />\nparticular type of rapist is the<br />\nmost difficult to convict.\"When<br />\nthe issue is that the rapist uses<br />\nonly that force necessary to<br />\novercome your will--things come<br />\ndown to an estimation of what<br />\nthat force used must be in that<br />\nparticular case.\"<br />\nWenck defined rape according to law, as \"forcible vaginal<br />\nintercourse.\" He distinguished<br />\nbetween categories of rape and<br />\nseverity of sentences imposed in<br />\nterms of type of assault and<br /><br />\ndegree of force used.<br />\nHe described two common<br />\ndefenses alleged assailants make<br />\nto the charge of rape. If the<br />\nvictim and the attacker are<br />\nstrangers, the assailant may<br />\nplead mistaken identity: If the<br />\ntwo are acquainted, the legal<br />\nresponse might be to construe<br />\ntlfat the woman had somehow<br />\nbeen provocative, that she was<br />\nstupid enough to place herself in<br />\na situation the danger of which<br />\nshe should have been aware.<br />\n\"This is one of the myths about<br />\nrape that we have to exorcise.\"<br />\nBenson began by listing the<br />\nservices offered by the Center<br />\nfor Victims of Sexual Assault.<br />\nThe Center operates a 24-hour<br />\nhotline at 366-RAPE for confidential counseling to victims and<br />\ntheir families. Upon request,<br />\nthey accompany victims through<br />\nhospital and court procedures.<br />\nBenson said that three Baltimore city hospitals have specialized facilities to cope with<br />\nvictims of assault: City, Mercy<br />\nand University. He urged all<br />\nvictims to go to a hospital as<br />\nquickly as possible after an<br />\nattack. Besides obtaining treatment, the victim is examined for<br />\nevidence that can be used should<br /><br />\nhe decide to prosecute his<br />\nattacker.<br />\nHe discussed what happens<br />\nto victims and their friends and<br />\nfamilies as a result of assaut and<br />\nways that those close to the<br />\nvictim can help. Common emotional and physiological responses to assault include an<br />\ninitial calmness comparable to a<br />\nstate of shock; disturbance of<br />\nsleep and eating patterns; phobic<br />\nfears of crowds or dark places;<br />\nand paralysis from fear. \"You're<br />\nresponding to the threat of being<br />\nkilled. But there's something<br />\nmore. There's the added dimension of sexuality--along with .fear<br />\nof humiliation, degradation,<br />\nguilt, shame, embarrassment, desire for revenge.\"<br />\nBenson emphasized the seriousness which long-term effects<br />\nof an assault may have for<br />\nrelationships between the victim<br />\nand a spouse or lover. They<br />\ninclude the inability of the<br />\nvictim to resume sexual activity;<br />\ninability of wife and husband<br />\nto even talk about the attack;<br />\njealousy, and the breakup of<br />\nmarriages and relationships. He<br />\nsaid that \"often spouses and<br />\nlovers blame themselves for not<br />\npreventing the attack or the<br /><br />\nvictim for being a victim.\"<br />\n\"Nobody comes to an assault in a vacuum. We have<br />\npersonal characteristics, histories<br />\nthat affect how we will cope.<br />\nSupport systems (families and<br />\nfriends) are another important<br />\nfactor-the key to the whole<br />\nhealing process.\"<br />\nHall described the medical,<br />\ncounseling and security services<br />\navailable to victims of assault at<br />\nHopkins. \"We provide good<br />\nsecurity and services. They're<br />\nnot perfect; one incident is one<br />\nincident too many. One should<br />\nnot.be tolerated.<br />\n\"Yet at the same time you<br />\nshould be aware of where you<br />\nlive.

However, if the Student Council feels<br />\nstrongly about this issue, it<br />\nshould itself endorse the boycott, rather than referring the<br />\nmatter to the student body<br />\nas a whole. Most of us know<br />\nlittle about the issue of this<br />\nreferendum, the sales practices<br />\nof Nestle Co. in underdeveloped<br />\ncountries. The Student Council<br />\ncould make a more intelligent<br />\ndecision on this issue than we<br />\ncan, since it presumably would<br />\nmake such a decision only after<br />\nresearching the issue, hearing<br />\nboth sides of it, and debating it.<br />\nMost members of the student<br />\nbody understandably lack the<br />\ntime and inclination to find out<br />\nenough about this matter to<br />\nmake an intelligent decision.<br />\nFrom what I have heard about<br />\nNestle's sales practices in underdeveloped countries, which has<br />\nbeen from the supporters of this<br />\nboycott, they seem very bad<br />\nindeed. However, before I could<br />\nendorse such a boycott, I would<br />\nhave to find out more about the<br />\nissue: not only about Nestle's<br /><br />\nsales practices, but also about<br />\nwho organized this world-wide<br />\nboycott, and why this Swiss<br />\ncorporation was singled out to<br />\nbe boycotted, rather than other<br />\ncorporations, which, according<br />\nto the supporters of this boycott, have similar unsavory sales<br />\npractices. The students should,<br />\nby voting no in next week's<br />\nreferendum, tell the Student<br />\nCouncil, and the supporters of<br />\nthis boycott, that they will not<br />\ngive their support to projects<br />\nand purposes they know little<br />\nabout.<br />\nJoseph Hammerman<br /><br />\nG.R.O.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nIt is the position of the<br />\nGraduate Representative Organization that the Chaplain's Office<br />\nprovides a worthwhile service to<br />\nthe Hopkins community and we<br />\nactively support its efforts<br />\nOne vital aspect of a university education entails the exposure to broad social issues.

I have to get<br />\nalong with a vocabulary of about fifteen hundred<br />\nserviceable words that I just Use over and over again,<br />\ntrying to rearrange them in an interesting order. Sid is<br />\nlike a Roxy organ that has three decks,fifty stops, and a<br />\npride of pedals under the bench. When he wants a<br />\nword, it's there. Sid even speaks with precision--a feat<br />\nmany a writer is incapable of.. In the realm of satire,<br />\nparody, and burlesque, he has, from the beginning,<br />\nbowed to none.<br /><br />\nCorset and Underwear Review displayed next to the<br />\nAmerican Bee JournaL However, newsstands make<br />\nstrange bedfellows, as anyone who has ever slept with a<br />\nnewsstand can testify, and if you think about it at all<br />\n(instead of sitting there in a torpor with your mouth<br />\nhalf-open) you'd see this proximity is not only alphabetical. Both the Corset and Underwear Review and the<br />\nAmerican Bee Journal are concerned with honeys;<br />\nalthough I am beast enough to prefer a photograph ofa<br />\nsucculent nymph in a satin Lastex Girdleiere with Thrill<br />\nPlus Bra to the most dramatic snapshot of an apiary,<br />\neach has its place in my scheme.\"<br /><br />\n--E.B. White,1968<br /><br />\nAs evidenced by the countless puns and allusions<br />\nthat permeate his writing, Perelman was a well-read man.<br />\nHis favorite authors were James Joyce, T.S. Eliot, H.L.<br />\nMencken, W. Somerset. Maugham and Charles Dickens.<br />\nIndeed, many of his characters bear mock-Dickensian<br />\nnames like Urban Sprawl, architect; Hawfinch and<br />\nMealwoi-in, tailors; Howells and Imprecation, lawyers;<br />\nWhitelipped and Trembling, brokers; Chalky Aftertaste<br />\nand His Musical Poltroons, a ragtime band; Sir Hamish<br />\nSphincter, a British diplomat; Arpad Fustian, \"the rug<br />\nchandler\"; Larszny, a Hungarian pianist; Lucas Membrande and Marcel Riboflavin, the French police inspector in the case of \"The Saucier's Apprentice.\"<br />\nSometimes the titles of Perelman's essays are as<br />\nfunny as the essays themselves. A glance at the table of<br />\ncontents of Crazy Like A Fox (formerly published as<br />\nThe Best of S.J. Perelman) reveals: \"A Farewell to<br />\nOmsk,\" \"A Pox On You, Mine Goodly Host,\" \"Midwinter Facial Trends,\" \"Beat Me, Post-Impressionist<br />\nDaddy,\" \"Farewell, My Lovely Appetizer,\" and \"Well,<br />\nRoll Me In A Turkish Towel!\"<br />\n\"The titles lent themselves to plagiarism,\" the<br />\nNew York Times pointed out in a front page obituary,<br />\n\"but Mr. Perelman was generous. In an interview,<br />\nhe once said that he was writing his autobiography,and<br />\nwould call it 'Smiling, the Boy Fell Dead.' A play<br />\npromptly opened under that name. Thereafter, he said<br />\nhis autobiography would be called 'The Hindsight Saga.'\"<br /><br />\nE.B. White, the great American essayist, must be<br />\nfeeling awfully lonesome these days at his home on the<br />\ncoast of Maine. At 80, White is one of a vanishing breed<br />\nof writers who met and became friends while working on<br />\na struggling new weekly called The New Yorker. Their<br />\nprose--graceful but simple, sophisticated but straightforward\u2014most often dealt with the humor that arose<br />\nfrom life's more uncomfortable and ironic situations.<br />\nFifty years later, nearly all the creators of that style of<br />\nprose are gone: James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Frank<br />\nSullivan, Dorothy Parker, John McNulty, and now S.J.<br />\nPerelman, who died last week at the age of 75.<br />\nAny encyclopedia would put these writers under<br />\nthe sub-category of \"humorist,\" but, as Thurber cautioned, \"To call such people 'humorists,' a loose-fitting<br />\nand ugly word, is to miss the nature of their dilemma<br />\nand the dilemma of their nature. The little wheels of<br />\ntheir invention are set in motion by the damp hand of<br />\nmelancholy.\"<br />\nLike his colleagues at The New Yorker, Perelman<br />\nwas a sedate person who made a career out of writing<br />\ncomic pieces. \"He was utterly serious, but his medium<br />\nsimply was humor,\" remarked William Shawn, the<br />\nmagazine's current editor. \"He was widely appreciated<br />\nas a humorist, but people were so enormously entertained by him that they sometimes overlooked his great<br />\noriginality and his literary brilliance.\"<br />\nThough not necessarily a cut above his cohorts<br />\non The New Yorker, Perelman was a cut apart--more<br />\nbiting, more vitriolic, and often funnier. \"Generally<br />\nspeaking,\" he once said in an interview,\"I don't believe<br />\nin kindly humor--I don't think it exists. One of the most<br />\nshameful utterances to stem from the human mouth is<br />\nWill Rogers's 'I never met a man I didn't like.' The<br />\nabsolute antithesis is Oscar Wilde on the kodiunting<br />\nEnglishman: `The unspeakable in full pursuit of the<br />\nuneatable.' W\"-w- remark contains, in briefest span, the<br />\ntruth, whereas kub.....; s is pure flatulence, crowd-pleasing<br /><br />\nand fake humility.\"<br />\nSidney Joseph Perelman was born in Brooklyn<br />\non Feb. 1, 1904, and grew up in Providence, R.I. While<br />\nhis father worked unsuccessfully as a machinist, a<br />\ndry-goods merchant, and a poultry farmer, the boy<br />\ncrammed his mind with the popular novels and movies<br />\nof the era. His ambition was to be a cartoonist. He<br />\npracticed on the cardboard boxes his father brought<br />\nhome from the dry-goods store, and later, at Brown<br />\nUniversity, Perelman drew cartoons for the college<br />\nhumor magazine. Following his graduation in 1924, he<br />\nlanded a job with the humor weekly,Judge.<br />\nPerelman worked as a cartoonist for several years<br />\nuntil he noticed that the captions were getting longer<br />\nand longer. They eventually replaced the cartoons and<br />\nbecame the prototype of the essay with which he would<br />\nlater earn his reputation.<br />\nWhite observed that Perelman's pieces \"usually<br />\nhad a lead sentence, or lead paragraph, that was as<br />\nhair-raising as the first big dip on a roller coaster: it got<br />\nyou in the stomach, and when it was over you were<br />\nrelieved to feel deceleration setting in.\" An essay entitled \"Beauty and the Bee\" features just such an opening:<br />\n\"It is always something ofa shock to approach a<br />\nnewsstand which handles trade publications and find the<br /><br />\nI was collaborating with S.J. Perelman on Monkey Business. We had a difference of opinion on a line.<br />\nHe said, \"If you repeat that, I'll throw you out<br />\nthe window,\" whereupon, somewhat theatrically, I'll<br />\nadmit, I rose from my chair and walked to the window.<br />\n\"I thought I'd make it easier for you.\"<br />\nThis bit of youghful bravado was not a demonstration of courage. I knew for a fact that Perelman had<br />\nnever thrown anyone out ofa window and I was reasonably certain that I was not going to be the first.<br />\nBesides, the window was on the first floor.<br />\n--Arthur Sheekman<br /><br />\nGroucho with the-writers ofMonkey Business, counter-clockwise: Groucho (shading eyes),<br />\nSol Violinsky, Perelman, Will Johnstone, and Arthur Sheekman.<br /><br />\nMost people have met the Perelman style through<br />\nthe screenplays for Around the World in 80 Days and<br />\ntwo classic Marx Brothers movies, Monkey Business and<br />\nHorse Feathers. Perelman's scenario for Around the<br />\nWorld won him an Oscar, but his involvement with the<br />\nMarx Brothers proved somewhat less rewarding.<br />\nGroucho Marx met Perelman in 1930 and asked<br />\nhim to come to Hollywood to work on the Marx's next<br />\nfilm. At first the two men struck up a friendship and<br />\neven formed a small organization of scenarists called The<br />\nWest Side Writing and Asthma Club (Perelman's title).<br />\nBut then, as Groucho put it, \"things changed.\" Despite<br />\nmaking what most critics call the major contributions to<br />\nthe screenplays for Monkey Business and Horse<br />\nFeathers, Perelman left Tinsel Town, embittered over<br />\nthe chopping up of his scripts. After Perelman wrote a<br />\ncaustic article about the experience (with unkind comments aimed at Groucho in particular), his feud with<br />\nMarx hit full throttle.<br />\nNat Perrin, another collaborator on Monkey<br />\nBusiness, said, \"I can't remember exactly what Perelman<br />\nwrote about but it was most unflattering in, as I recall<br />\nnow, a more or less personal way. I was shocked when I<br />\nread it because I always felt there was a very warm<br />\npersonal feeling between them...1 had mentioned it to<br />\nGrouch() and had no idea how hurt, angry and bitter he<br />\nwas about it.\"<br />\nFrom then on, the relationship between Perelman and Groucho was cautious at best. Later, the two<br /><br />\nwere heard together on a radio interview with Kenneth<br />\nTynan (\"Tynan thought it would be great,\" Grouch()<br />\nrecalled. \"having both me and Perelman on his show. It<br />\nended up being the dullest fucking interview there ever<br />\nwas. Perelman was trying to outdo me and I was trying<br />\nto outdo him and we both stunk...\"), and around 1960,<br />\nPerelman sent a photograph of himself to Marx. It was<br />\ninscribed: \"To Groucho, in memory of our many<br />\ncampaigns in the Sudan.\"<br />\nGroucho nonetheless maintained that Perelman<br />\nwas \"a son of a bitch with a head as big as my desk,\"<br />\nand Perelman would one day recollect, \"I did two films<br />\nwith them, which in its way is perhaps my greatest<br />\ndistinction in life, because anybody who ever worked on<br />\nany picture for the Marx Brothers said he would rather<br />\nbe chained to a galley oar and lashed at ten-minute<br />\nintervals than ever work for these sons of bitches again.\"<br />\nA few years before his death, Groucho softened a little<br />\nand wrote in his pictorial autobiography, The Groucho<br />\nPhile, \"In recent years the press has concocted a feud<br />\nbetween S.J. Perelman and me, but no such feud ever<br />\nexisted. Sid has often been asked about writing for the<br />\nMarx Brothers, and I have often answered questions<br />\nabout his contributions to our films. What Sid and I<br />\nboth agree on is that he is a great writer with a brilliant<br />\ncomic mind that didn't always mesh well with the<br />\nlunacies of the Marx Brothers.\"<br />\nI believe it was Hippolyte Taine--or possibly<br />\nMonroe Taine, the tailor, a philosophical chap who used<br />\nto press my pants 40 years ago in the Village--who once<br />\nobserved that immortality is a chancy matter, subject to<br />\nthe caprice of the unborn.<br />\n--S.J. Perelman<br />\nUnlike poets, playwrights, novelists, and other<br />\nwriters of grander repute, humorists--or, in deference to<br />\nThurber, the authors of light pieces--customarily resign<br />\nthemselves to the fact that they are second-rate citizens<br />\nin the world of Literature. Typically, Perelman gave<br />\nlittle or no thought to the issue of immortality. In fact,<br />\nhe seemed to anticipate the approaching extinction of<br />\nhis genre: \"The handful of chumps who still practice it<br />\nare as lonely as the survivors of Fort Zinderneuf; a few<br />\nmore assaults by television and picture journalism and<br />\nwe might as well post their bodies on the ramparts, pray<br />\nfor togetherness, and kneel for the final annihilation.<br />\nUntil then, so long and don't take any wooden rhetoric.<br />\nIn a slightly more serious vein, William Shawn<br />\n:.ommented last week on Perelman's dedication to his<br />\ncrafi:. \"Over the years, people often put pressure on him<br /><br />\nFriends or foes: Groucho with one of his autobiographies,<br />\nand Perelman in the photo he sent to Marx around 1960.<br />\nto write something they considered serious-:a novel, course, he invariably used it to comic effect.\" From the<br />\nsay\u2014but he was never diverted from doing what he \u2022 New York Times: \"He had a spectacular command of<br />\napparently was born to do, which was to write short 'language, and the ability to transform the common<br />\nhumor pieces.\"<br />\ncliche\u2022or figure of speech into an exploding cigar.\"<br />\nDiscussions as to whether or not Perelman's<br />\nPerhaps Vonnegut's metaphor of the piccolo<br />\nname will endure--and if so, how long\u2014would be purely virtuoso playing 'The Stars and Stripes Forever' best<br />\nacademic (pardon the pun). For the time being, how- sums up Perelman's place in American writing. As<br />\never, the post-mortem praise is rolling in. From John anyone familiar with the renowned Sousa composition<br />\nUpdike: \"What always struck me was the way Perelman can attest, the piccolo plays an exuberant harmony<br />\nused the English language like a bolo--the way he got the counter to the famous melody which is rendered by the<br />\nlanguage whirling of its own momentum, and somehow horns. Like the powerful brass of'The Stars and Stripes<br />\nevery sentence ended in a laugh, and he'd bring the Forever,' the big names of 20th century American<br />\ntarget down.\" From Kurt Vonnegut: \"Perelman literature--Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Faulkner, Bellow, et<br />\nhandled the American language the way a virtuoso al\u2014attract most of the attention, while S.J. Perelman,<br />\npiccolo player plays 'The Stars and Stripes Forever'; he like the strain of the piccolo, dances jubilantly in the<br />\nwas an extraordinary master of the language, and, of background.<br /><br />\nPICKS FROM PERELMAN<br /><br />\n\"Well, autumn is here again, and very shortly<br />\nevery Tom, Dick and Harry will be asking himself the<br />\nquestion 'Poison mushrooms--yes \u2022or no?'

After experiencing this<br />\ntwo-and-one-half hour odyssey through<br />\nthe depths of the Vietnam war, an<br />\naverage viewer reacts with little more<br />\nthan numbed silence. It is a powerful,<br />\nemotionally draining film that must be<br />\nexperienced to be believed.<br />\nCoppola, the film's producer,<br />\ndirector, and co-screenwriter, summed up<br />\nhis purpose in creating this work in a<br />\nsentence: \"The film's purpose is to give<br />\nits audience a sense of the horror, the<br />\nmadness, the sensuousness, and the moral<br />\ndilemma of the Vietnam war.\" After<br />\nseeing the film twice, I can say that he<br />\nhas succeeded, but not perfectly. The<br />\nfilm has moments of spectacular artistic<br />\nsuccess as well as scenes which can only<br />\nbe described as failures.<br />\nThe story revolves around the<br />\nadventures of a Green Beret Captain<br />\nnamed Willard while on a special mission<br />\nsomewhere in South Vietnam. The role<br />\nof Willard is a difficult one, and six<br />\nwell-known actors turned down the role<br />\nbefore Martin Sheen agreed to try it.<br />\nSheen succeeds in making the characterization of Willard a credible one, with<br />\nhuman strengths and weaknesses. Captain Willard's mission is to track down<br />\nand kill another Green Beret officer,<br />\nColonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has<br />\nbeen illegally operating against the<br />\nCambodian enemy with native troops.<br />\nfrom a Navy patrol boat.<br />\nWillard searches for Kurtz along<br />\nthe rivers of Vietnam. Coppola uses the<br />\nvessel and its Crew to show the audience<br />\nas much of the war as possible. The<br />\nboat's crew is a cross-section of America's<br />\narmy. A young ghetto black, a drug-crazed California surfer, a gourmet cook from<br />\nNew Orleans, and a middle-aged Navy<br />\nlifer are all thrown together on this<br />\nminiature \"ship of fools.\" From the<br />\nunique perspective of the river, we see<br />\nvarious pieces of the war raging on<br /><br />\naround us; a helicopter assault on a<br />\nvillage, massacres of Vietnamese civilians,<br />\nand other similar incidents. In one of the<br />\nfilm's lighter moments, we are treated to<br />\na USO-type performance, complete with<br />\nPlayboy bunnies, at an isolated jungle<br />\noutpost. Most of the film's action takes<br />\nplace on or near the boat or its passengers.,<br />\nThroughout most of the film,<br />\na secondary role. Coppola<br />\nplays<br />\nKurtz<br />\nmakes the war -the star of the first two<br />\nhours; we meet Kurtz only in the last<br />\nsegments. When Willard and his surviving<br />\ncompanions reach Kurtz' jungle compound, the whole focus of the action<br />\nshifts to the very personal confrontation<br />\nbetween Kurtz and Willard. This change<br />\nis dramatic, radically altering the entire<br />\nmood and intensity of the film. Here the<br />\nstory takes on a surreal, almost Mystical<br />\nquality. But winding up the film afier30<br />\nor so minutes of Brando's ramblings<br />\nprovides an unsatisfying finale.<br />\nCoppola has built his reputation<br />\nas a film-maker on creating suspenseful,<br />\nactionpacked works such as The Godfather and its sequel.

His colorful paintings had a broad<br />\ninfluence on America 1940's and 50's.<br />\nAlthough these painted abstractions are<br />\nfar better known than Hoffman's drawings, his paintings owe much of their<br />\nverve and spontaneity to drawings in<br />\n, which he continuously worked on artistic<br />\nFifty-three<br />\nproblems and solutions.<br />\nblack-and-white drawings from all phases<br />\nof Hoffman's career are being shown,<br />\n\" many for the first time, at the Baltimore<br />\n, Museum of Art through December 16.<br />\nAll Hoffman's art reflects his<br /><br />\nPilot Ego<br />\ncont.from p. 12<br />\npilots, and space technology, to understand and share the \"shockkkk of recognition\" with those seven who dared to<br />\npossess \"the right stuff.\"<br />\nThough most of the book concerns itself with the astronauts' ascent to<br />\nthe top of the competency pyramid, the<br />\nfirst chapter begins with the wife of a<br />\nNavy test pilot talking to another pilot's<br />\nwife on the phone. Word is that \"something's happened out there.\" Her husband<br />\nunaccounted for, Jane Conrad worries<br />\nthat Pete has been \"burned beyond<br />\nrecognition\"--in other words, turned into<br />\nwhat \"looked like an enormous fowl that<br />\nhas burned up in a stove, burned a<br />\nblackish brown all over, greasy and<br />\nblistered, fried, in a word, with not only<br />\nthe entire face and all the hair and the<br />\nears burned off, not to mention all the<br />\nclothing, but also the hands and feet,<br />\nwith what remains of the arms and legs<br />\nbent at the knees and elbows and burned<br />\ninto absolutely rigid angles...\"--while<br />\ntesting high-speed planes in the Florida<br />\nswamp of Edward's Navy base. Fortunately for Jane, and unfortunately for<br />\nLoretta, the casualty is Bud Jennings.<br />\nThus begins the ritual of the man from<br />\nthe Society for Widows and Orphans<br />\nwaiting dutifully at the door, the bridge<br />\ncoated pilots at the funeral, and the<br />\ndinner party discussions--yes, Bud had<br />\nbeen a good man, but inexperienced;<br />\n\"when the malfunction in the controls<br />\nput him in that bad corner, he didn't<br />\nknow how to get out of it.\"<br />\nThis first chapter prepares the<br />\nreader to understand the mentality of<br />\n\"the right stuff.\" According to Wolfe, the<br />\npilots would never mention death,<br />\ndanger, bravery, or fear by name; rather,<br />\nthey would use code words and examples.<br />\nFor instance, the pilot who dropped 8100<br />\nfeet and smashed into the ground when<br />\nhis parachute failed to open was killed<br />\nbecause of his own negligence in not<br />\nchecking the chute or that of his crew for<br />\nnot checking it before take-off. In short,<br />\n\"there are no accidents and no fatal flaws<br />\nin the machinery; there are only pilots<br />\nwith the wrong stuff.\" Wolfe explores<br />\nthis mentality even further with his<br />\ndescription of The Pilot Ego: \"The Pilot<br />\nEgo--ego didn't come any bigger! The<br />\nboys wouldn't have minded the following. They wouldn't have minded appearing once a year on a balcony .over a huge<br />\nsquare in which half the'world is<br />\nassembled. They wave. The world roars<br />\nits approval, its applause, and breaks into<br />\na sushined thirty-minute storm of cheers<br />\nand tears (moved by my righteous<br />\nstuff!).\" So, right means not only professional competence, but righteousness,<br />\nelevated purpose and spirituality, the<br />\nbelief that you are flying on God's<br />\nright hand side.\"A little adulation on the<br />\norder of the Pope's, that's all the True<br /><br />\nobservation of, and reaction to, the<br />\neveryday world. Even in his most abstract drawings, one can recognize naturalistic shapes. But he did not attempt to<br />\nimitate the formal properties of his<br />\nsubjects; rather, he translated these<br />\nproperties into the new, two-dimensional<br />\nspace through a prismatic perception.<br />\nParticularly in his landscapes, Hoffman<br />\nsimplified and grouped numerous forms,<br />\nalmost in the manner of a child's drawing,<br />\ncreating variety within them by using<br />\ndifferent brush or pencil strokes.<br />\nAs a colorist, Hoffman was<br />\nconcerned with textural surfaces on<br />\nwhich he pitted high-keyed colors against<br />\neach other. In the much more austere<br />\nand limited domain of ink and pencil, he<br />\ncompensated by developing many kinds<br />\nof marks and notations to fill space. The<br />\nmarks are energetic and chaotic; yet they<br />\nexert subtle unifying forces as they repeat<br />\nin different parts of the drawing. Hoffman used lines not only for representational outline, but also structurally. The<br />\nplacement of lines and masses is as<br />\nimportant as the subject in determining a<br />\ndrawing's character.<br />\nLandscapes dominate the period<br />\n1930-1940. Hoffman examined fields,<br />\nbeaches, city streets, furniture, and<br />\ntable-top miscellany, combining Cubist<br />\ngeometry with dynamic shadings, crosshatching, scribbling, etc. One can observe<br />\nshapes in these drawings which reappear<br />\nin his abstract paintings as fully-developed compositions.
