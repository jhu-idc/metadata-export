With this thought in<br />\nmind we should shudder as we note on the campus the apparent<br />\ninertia and indifference regarding 1924 June Week. The first June<br />\nWeek, managed by the Class of 1923 with the co-operation of the<br />\nundergraduate body, was a success far beyond the hopes of its most<br />\noptimistic supporters. We fear that Hopkins, remembering only<br />\nthe result and forgetting the labor involved, is taking further good<br />\nfortune for granted.<br />\nAnd in all fairness we cannot but say that this inertia is caused<br />\nby the inactivity of the Senior Class and, especially, of the June<br />\nWeek Committee. Recently, an excellent and practical plan of stampselling was devised. To the writer's knowledge, however, the stamps<br />\nhave only been placed on sale upon one occasion, and, then, most' of<br />\nthe seniors who had charge of the work expected lowerclassmen<br />\nto flock around them with their money.<br />\nIn the way of constructive criticism, we would suggest that<br />\nweekly \"Tag Days,\" similar to those of last year, be inaugurated.<br />\nTags, then, could be given in addition to the stamps and the desire<br />\nof conformity will cause many men who do not expect to attend<br />\nthe series of affairs to part with a small amount of change. There<br />\nare many who will willingly support June Week if only given an<br />\nopportunity.<br />\nJune Week is not \"going across' on its own volition.

With this thought in<br />\nmind we should shudder as we note on the campus the apparent<br />\ninertia and indifference regarding 1924 June Week. The first June<br />\nWeek, managed by the Class of 1923 with the co-operation of the<br />\nundergraduate body, was a success far beyond the hopes of its most<br />\noptimistic supporters. We fear that Hopkins, remembering only<br />\nthe result and forgetting the labor involved, is taking further good<br />\nfortune for granted.<br />\nAnd in all fairness we cannot but say that this inertia is caused<br />\nby the inactivity of the Senior Class and, especially, of the June<br />\nWeek Committee. Recently, an excellent and practical plan of stampselling was devised.
