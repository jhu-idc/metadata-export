It was the first time<br />\nin seven games that the Blue Jays had really shown any real<br />\namount of court ability. Fresh from smarting defeats from little<br />\nTowson Teachers and a strong Rutgers five the Jays took the floor<br />\nagainst the Bullets as 20 point underdogs. The fact that they found<br />\nthemselves long enough to furnish a real upset for the capacity<br />\nhouse only proves what they are capable of.<br />\n<br />\ntertain a perenially strong Gettysburg eight for its first real test<br />\nof the current season tomorrow<br />\nnight at 8:00 in the Homewood<br />\ngym.<br />\nLast Saturday, Coach Wackenlint's squad<br />\n<br />\nHaverford<br />\n<br />\ndowned<br />\n<br />\n19 to 13 at Philadelphia, taking<br />\nfive matches out of the eight, while<br />\nGettysburg beat the same team<br />\n<br />\nLEFT AT THE POST<br />\n<br />\nthe week before 25 to 10.<br />\n<br />\nHead Coach Howdy Myers has the problem of flooring a winning basketball team and, on the face of it, it does not seem like too<br />\ntough an assignment. But the same man has the job of building a<br />\nwinning football team and a winning lacrosse team. This might<br />\nnot be compjetely fantastic except for the simple fact that the<br />\nseasons overlap. At the time Howdy should be looking over the<br />\nbasketball turnout, he is out of town scouting for the fourth<br />\nfootball game. At the time he should be cutting the squad and<br />\nlining up a cage offense, he is getting ready to play Western<br />\nMaryland football. By the time he should have his first five picked<br />\nand the rough edges all smoothed he finally gets a chance to see<br />\njust how many boys he will have'out for the cage game. Then come<br />\nthe Thanksgiving Holidays. This schedule puts him six weeks<br />\nbehind every team that he will play during the winter.<br />\nBut it doesn't end there. If by some chance he is able to<br />\nsalvage a tournament berth out of the mad rush, he finds that he<br />\nhas to start lacrosse practice while his basketball team is still<br />\ntrying for two - pointers. He can't let the stick game ride, either.<br />\nRemember, he has a National Championship on the line.<br />\n<br />\nSquad Not Picked<br />\nCharlie Brunsman who has won<br />\nall three of his matches this year,<br />\ntwo by falls, is expected to start<br />\nthe Blue Jays off in the 121 pound<br />\nclass.<br />\nThe 12Ss and the 136s are not<br />\nas<br />\n<br />\nyet<br />\n<br />\nspecifically<br />\n<br />\ndetermined,<br />\n<br />\nwith three man battling for the<br />\ntwo berths\u2014Ted Philips, Harry<br />\nTighe, and Guy Cromwell.<br />\nAdam Liepold will fill the 145<br />\npound slot against Gettysburg.

He has to get ready for a game in another five days and<br />\nends up losing it and a lot more. There can be no other solution.<br />\nHe can't win without the time to build a team and under the<br />\npresent Hopkins set-up, he hasn't got the time.<br />\nSuch a system is also unfair to the boys who play.
