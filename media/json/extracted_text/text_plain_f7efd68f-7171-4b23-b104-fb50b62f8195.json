Musial<br />\nRichard Lidz<br />\n<br />\nDr. Oppenheimer Emphasizes<br />\nPhilosophic,NotTechnic, uest<br />\n<br />\nDecline And Fall<br />\nFor the past three years the Cotillion Board has been<br />\nnotoriously deficient in carrying out even its minimal duties:<br />\nthe planning of large social functions, the handling of funds,<br />\nthe coordination of diverse social events, and the holding<br />\nof a \"try-out\" system each year for the selection of new<br />\nBoard members.<br />\nBut this year it appears that the Cotillion Board has<br />\nreached the nadir of its career; it has at vari6us times fallen<br />\ndown in every broad field of its stated endeavors. In order,<br />\nthe Board has shown itself incapable of planning large social<br />\nfunctions by neglecting its own recent dance to the point<br />\nwhere it had not certainly secured a spot for it until three<br />\ndays before the dance itself; incompetent in the handling<br />\nof funds by failing to turn over to the SAC the proceeds from<br />\nthat dance until threatened with disbandment; inadequate<br />\nin the coordination of social events by confusing the dance<br />\ndates of the IFB and the \"H\" Club and by so doing forcing<br />\nthe IFB spring formal into the dreary confines of the gym;<br />\n,and of questionable ability in the handling of try-outs by<br />\nelecting new members, it is suspected, largely -on the rigid<br />\nbasis of fraternity alliances.<br />\nThe SAC, long patient, is finally contemplating the recommendation to the administration that the Cotillion Board<br />\nbe sweepingly reorganized\u2014that its purposes and the machinery foy accomplishing those purposes be redefined.<br />\nWe wonder whether the trouble with the Cotillion Board<br />\nis not so much a failure in the construct of the organization's machinery as it is the deficiencies of the people who<br />\nare running the Board and have been running it for as<br />\n\u2022 long as we can remember\u2014people who are the product of<br />\nthe near-complete domination of the Cotillion Board by a<br />\nsingle fraternity.<br />\nIn this light, we again wonder whether the SAC's threatened reorganization of the machinery is really aimed at the<br />\nheart of the Board's annual difficulty, i.e., the personnel. But<br />\nwe are forced to the conclusion that the only way, in our<br />\ndemocratic community to dispense with the products of<br />\nstale machinery is to dispense with the machinery.<br />\n<br />\nAnother Kind Of Academic Freedom<br />\nThere is no greater temptation for an adult than<br />\nto admonish or correct an adolescent and even that quasiadolescent, the college man. Especially is it tempting for an<br />\nadministrator, whose whole raison d'etre is to keep things<br />\nrunning smoothly and noiselessly, to stifle the activities of<br />\nalways inquisitive, but admittedly inexperienced, collegiate<br />\njournalists. The News-Letter's exchange files reveal more<br />\nthan one_campus paper whose editorial probings have been<br />\nthrottled, sometimes by an ouster of the editors.<br />\nOur recent \"sacre du printemps,\" which, thanks to the<br />\nactivities of non-News-Letter people, angered the Chairman<br />\nof the Board of Trustees, was the crucial test of journalistic<br />\nfreedom here; the administration passed with flying colors<br />\n\u2014no recriminations, no threats, no reprisals.<br />\nMore to the point are the administrative reactions to<br />\nserious columnar content\u2014especially what is found in the<br />\neditorial columns. Here the long-term administrator reads,<br />\nyear after year, things which he would rather keep quiet\u2014<br />\noften chronic and virtually insoluble problems, whose rehashing, though of interest to the ever-changing student<br />\nbody, merely re-opens, for him, a controversy he had hoped<br />\nwas finally buried.<br />\nYet for five generations of News-Letter editors, no edict<br />\nof suppression has ever been laid down as a fiat; treatment<br />\nof the touchiest issues has been left to the discretion of the<br />\neditors. It seems to us that this policy is of value for two<br />\nreasons: it provides a clear, honest atmosphere for the incubation of a thinking man (the journalist himself), and it<br />\nrecognizes that the services of a gadfly\u2014even as imperfect<br />\na one as the amateur editor\u2014are not without significance.<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN MAYO-WELLS, BUD TURNBULL, SID WALDRON<br />\nNews Editor<br />\nAssociate Editor<br />\n\"I am sincerely interested in<br />\nthe less technical and more humane questions, which one could<br />\ncall philosophical and psychological,\" stated Dr. J.

Musial<br />\nRichard Lidz<br /><br />\nDr. Oppenheimer Emphasizes<br />\nPhilosophic,NotTechnic, uest<br /><br />\nDecline And Fall<br />\nFor the past three years the Cotillion Board has been<br />\nnotoriously deficient in carrying out even its minimal duties:<br />\nthe planning of large social functions, the handling of funds,<br />\nthe coordination of diverse social events, and the holding<br />\nof a \"try-out\" system each year for the selection of new<br />\nBoard members.<br />\nBut this year it appears that the Cotillion Board has<br />\nreached the nadir of its career; it has at vari6us times fallen<br />\ndown in every broad field of its stated endeavors. In order,<br />\nthe Board has shown itself incapable of planning large social<br />\nfunctions by neglecting its own recent dance to the point<br />\nwhere it had not certainly secured a spot for it until three<br />\ndays before the dance itself; incompetent in the handling<br />\nof funds by failing to turn over to the SAC the proceeds from<br />\nthat dance until threatened with disbandment; inadequate<br />\nin the coordination of social events by confusing the dance<br />\ndates of the IFB and the \"H\" Club and by so doing forcing<br />\nthe IFB spring formal into the dreary confines of the gym;<br />\n,and of questionable ability in the handling of try-outs by<br />\nelecting new members, it is suspected, largely -on the rigid<br />\nbasis of fraternity alliances.<br />\nThe SAC, long patient, is finally contemplating the recommendation to the administration that the Cotillion Board<br />\nbe sweepingly reorganized\u2014that its purposes and the machinery foy accomplishing those purposes be redefined.<br />\nWe wonder whether the trouble with the Cotillion Board<br />\nis not so much a failure in the construct of the organization's machinery as it is the deficiencies of the people who<br />\nare running the Board and have been running it for as<br />\n\u2022 long as we can remember\u2014people who are the product of<br />\nthe near-complete domination of the Cotillion Board by a<br />\nsingle fraternity.<br />\nIn this light, we again wonder whether the SAC's threatened reorganization of the machinery is really aimed at the<br />\nheart of the Board's annual difficulty, i.e., the personnel. But<br />\nwe are forced to the conclusion that the only way, in our<br />\ndemocratic community to dispense with the products of<br />\nstale machinery is to dispense with the machinery.<br /><br />\nAnother Kind Of Academic Freedom<br />\nThere is no greater temptation for an adult than<br />\nto admonish or correct an adolescent and even that quasiadolescent, the college man. Especially is it tempting for an<br />\nadministrator, whose whole raison d'etre is to keep things<br />\nrunning smoothly and noiselessly, to stifle the activities of<br />\nalways inquisitive, but admittedly inexperienced, collegiate<br />\njournalists. The News-Letter's exchange files reveal more<br />\nthan one_campus paper whose editorial probings have been<br />\nthrottled, sometimes by an ouster of the editors.<br />\nOur recent \"sacre du printemps,\" which, thanks to the<br />\nactivities of non-News-Letter people, angered the Chairman<br />\nof the Board of Trustees, was the crucial test of journalistic<br />\nfreedom here; the administration passed with flying colors<br />\n\u2014no recriminations, no threats, no reprisals.<br />\nMore to the point are the administrative reactions to<br />\nserious columnar content\u2014especially what is found in the<br />\neditorial columns. Here the long-term administrator reads,<br />\nyear after year, things which he would rather keep quiet\u2014<br />\noften chronic and virtually insoluble problems, whose rehashing, though of interest to the ever-changing student<br />\nbody, merely re-opens, for him, a controversy he had hoped<br />\nwas finally buried.<br />\nYet for five generations of News-Letter editors, no edict<br />\nof suppression has ever been laid down as a fiat; treatment<br />\nof the touchiest issues has been left to the discretion of the<br />\neditors. It seems to us that this policy is of value for two<br />\nreasons: it provides a clear, honest atmosphere for the incubation of a thinking man (the journalist himself), and it<br />\nrecognizes that the services of a gadfly\u2014even as imperfect<br />\na one as the amateur editor\u2014are not without significance.<br /><br />\nBy JOHN MAYO-WELLS, BUD TURNBULL, SID WALDRON<br />\nNews Editor<br />\nAssociate Editor<br />\n\"I am sincerely interested in<br />\nthe less technical and more humane questions, which one could<br />\ncall philosophical and psychological,\" stated Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer of the Institute of Advanced Study in an exclusive interview with the Johns Hopkins<br />\nNews-Letter at Goucher College<br />\nlast Wednesday.<br />\nexplained<br />\nOppenheimer<br />\nDr.<br />\nthat the epistimological question<br />\nwas his prime philosophical concern.
