Seven years ago The Hopkins Review, emanating from the<br />\nWriting Seminars, was considered to be one of the finest in<br />\nthe nation. It contained contributions from some of the most<br />\nnoted contemporary writers in<br />\nthe English language. And yet it<br />\nwas allowed to die.<br />\nThe malady which brought<br />\nabout the demise of The Hopkins<br />\nReview, one common to nearly<br />\nevery literary magazine that ever<br />\nexisted, was lack of sufficient<br />\nfunds.<br />\nRobert Flottemesch, then an<br />\nundergraduate student, was editor for the debut issue of The<br />\nHopkins Review which appeared<br />\nin the Fall of 1947. Already it<br />\nhad taken some measure of its<br />\npotential, for included in the<br />\npages of this first issue were such<br />\nwriters as 1945 Pulitzer Prizewinner Karl Shapiro, then a<br />\nmember of the University facul..y, and Padraic Colum, then<br />\nguest lecturer in the Seminars in<br />\nWriting.<br />\nGrew Rapidly<br />\nBetween 1947 and 1949 The<br />\nHopkins Review was beginning to<br />\ngain a circle of respectability.<br />\nUnder the editorship of another<br />\nstudent, Robert Burns, the publication offered works by N. Bryllion Fagin, Pedro Salinas, and<br />\ntranslator Eleanor Turnbull.<br />\nIn 1949 Louis D. Rubin, Jr.,<br />\nnow head of the English Department at Hollins College in Virginia, became editor-in-chief and<br />\nThe Hopkins Review began a<br />\nsudden climb into national recognition. Throughout the rest of<br />\nits total 21 issues The Hopkins<br />\nReview became increasingly better until it was officially listed<br />\n<br />\nNORTIIWAY TAILORS<br />\n<br />\nby the editor of the oldest literary magazine in this country,<br />\nThe Sewanee Review, as \"the<br />\nfifth or sixth best literary magazine in America.\"<br />\nIn the opinion of some, the<br />\nHopkins Review was \"better than<br />\nany college magazine in the country.\" It had a national mailing<br />\nlist and sold out many issues.<br />\nFamous Names<br />\nThe fact is that The Hopkins<br />\nReview between 1949 and 1953<br />\nhad among its credits some<br />\nvery impressive literary figures.<br />\nAmong them were Kemp Malone, D.

Never did the periodical pay for any of its written<br />\nmaterial.<br />\nThroughout its 21-issue career the Review varied in size<br />\nfrom 48 to 212 pages (these being the number in its first and<br />\nlast issues, respectively).

So far no<br />\nsatisfactory theory has been advi.nced that fully explains it.<br />\nThere are five or six theories<br />\nthat explain parts of it, but even<br />\ntogether they do not approach a<br />\nfull definition of it.\"<br />\nAsked his opinion on those<br />\nwho make use of hypnotism,<br />\nsometimes for its entertainment<br />\nqualities and sometimes for<br />\nworthwhile causes but without<br />\nproper training, Dr. Shaffer emphasized that \"it is a great mistake for amateurs to practice<br />\nhypnotism.\" He continued, \"It is<br />\nhard to determine the dangers,<br />\nbut amateurs make mistakes<br />\nthat professional men do not<br />\nThe very fact that hypnotism<br />\ngives one person authority over<br />\nanother make it dangerous in<br />\nthe wrong hands.\"<br />\nDr. Shaffer illustrated this by<br />\nstating that one of the most frequently seen symptoms in mental<br />\nillness is the fear and suspicion<br />\nof being influenced by someone<br />\nelse. This often becomes apparent when patients pick out<br />\nelements of their environment<br />\nand say that these elements have<br />\nauthority over them. An amateur hypnotist can easily become<br />\nthe object of such fears.<br />\nNot A Parlor Game<br />\nDr. Shaffer expressed strong<br />\nobjection to the use of hypnotism<br />\nfor demonstrations or entertainment. \"It is not a parlor game.<br />\nand people who use it as such<br />\ncan harm others physically and<br />\nmentally,\" he stressed. ,Using<br />\n\"GIVE A GIFT WITH A<br />\nJ.H.U.

Even viewers<br />\nnot involved in the demonstration can become scared and turn<br />\nsuspicious after watching hypnosis, although they do not realize it at first.<br />\npersonality<br />\nto<br />\nregard<br />\nIn<br />\nchanges via hypnotism, Dr. Shaffer stated that \"the danger lies<br />\nprecisely in the fact that one<br />\nperson decides on the change and<br />\ndoes not consider all the elements involved, such as recurrence of weaknesses in other<br />\nforms, etc.\" He pointed out that<br />\npersonalities are often changed<br />\nwithout the use of hypnotism<br />\nsince it is often only a matter<br />\nof bolstering the subject's confidence.<br />\nLack Self-Confidence<br />\n\"In general people lack selfconfidence . \u2022 . and those who<br />\nretreat often to hypnotism or<br />\nyoga aren't satisfied with ordisomewhat<br />\nlife, being<br />\nnary<br />\nschizophrenic,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Shaffer explained further:<br />\n\"For some people auto-hypnosis<br />\nis possible, but dangerous and<br />\nshould only be done under professional directions. Almost anything that can be done through<br />\nhypnosis can be done without it<br />\nunder the right circumstances.<br />\nStrong suggestions outside hypnosis frequently accomplish their<br />\npurpose if the therapist understands the psychodynamics involved and is an adept therapist.\"<br />\nAsked whether anyone can be<br />\nhypnotized and made to do anything against his principles, Dr.<br />\nShaffer replied: \"Yes, some who<br />\ndo not wish to be hypnotized can<br />\nbe in long and regular periods<br />\nwith a professional. But it is<br />\nmuch more difficult, and usually<br />\na person will wake up before doing certain things that are<br />\nagainst his principles.\"<br />\n\"You could say that making a<br />\nfool of oneself or playing the<br />\npiano in public is against one's<br />\nprinciples, but it is the major<br />\naggressive acts that will not<br />\nwork.\"<br />\nDr. Shaffer, who is doing re-<br />\n<br />\nsearch in abnormal psychology<br />\nat Hopkins as well as working<br />\nwith patients at the SheppardPratt Institute, cited a case<br />\nwhere a man was given a rubber knife and asked to stab the<br />\nhypnotist with it. He did so, but<br />\nwhen given a real knife and<br />\nasked to do the same he woke<br />\nup instead, \"One's visual acidity<br />\ncan be either increased or decreased by hypnosis,\" he explained.<br />\nHypnotism Misused<br />\nHypnotism is misused simply<br />\nbecause it is too simple, Dr.<br />\nShaffer said. A great number of<br />\npersons can perform it. The suggestibility of a subject is related<br />\nto his personality and rapport<br />\nwith the hypnotist.<br />\nDr. Shaffer also reported that<br />\na National Board of Examiners<br />\nhas been set up to certify those<br />\ncapab'.. as professional hypnotists, in either the clinical or<br />\nexperimental fields, or both. Dr<br />\nShaffer is a member of this<br />\nBoard and an associated editor<br />\nof the International Journal of<br />\nClinical and Experimental rypnosis.<br />\nWhen asked about the psychotherapeutic value of hypnosis.<br />\nDr. Rosen explained, 'Mere hypnosis by itself means nothing.<br />\nPhyscians who utilize hypnotic<br />\ntechnique need to know a great<br />\ndeal about psychodynamics.\"<br />\nThe Hypnotic Relationship<br />\n\"The hypnotic relationship,<br />\nwhatever else it is, is a relationship between two people.

Seven years ago The Hopkins Review, emanating from the<br />\nWriting Seminars, was considered to be one of the finest in<br />\nthe nation. It contained contributions from some of the most<br />\nnoted contemporary writers in<br />\nthe English language. And yet it<br />\nwas allowed to die.<br />\nThe malady which brought<br />\nabout the demise of The Hopkins<br />\nReview, one common to nearly<br />\nevery literary magazine that ever<br />\nexisted, was lack of sufficient<br />\nfunds.<br />\nRobert Flottemesch, then an<br />\nundergraduate student, was editor for the debut issue of The<br />\nHopkins Review which appeared<br />\nin the Fall of 1947. Already it<br />\nhad taken some measure of its<br />\npotential, for included in the<br />\npages of this first issue were such<br />\nwriters as 1945 Pulitzer Prizewinner Karl Shapiro, then a<br />\nmember of the University facul..y, and Padraic Colum, then<br />\nguest lecturer in the Seminars in<br />\nWriting.<br />\nGrew Rapidly<br />\nBetween 1947 and 1949 The<br />\nHopkins Review was beginning to<br />\ngain a circle of respectability.<br />\nUnder the editorship of another<br />\nstudent, Robert Burns, the publication offered works by N. Bryllion Fagin, Pedro Salinas, and<br />\ntranslator Eleanor Turnbull.<br />\nIn 1949 Louis D. Rubin, Jr.,<br />\nnow head of the English Department at Hollins College in Virginia, became editor-in-chief and<br />\nThe Hopkins Review began a<br />\nsudden climb into national recognition. Throughout the rest of<br />\nits total 21 issues The Hopkins<br />\nReview became increasingly better until it was officially listed<br /><br />\nNORTIIWAY TAILORS<br /><br />\nby the editor of the oldest literary magazine in this country,<br />\nThe Sewanee Review, as \"the<br />\nfifth or sixth best literary magazine in America.\"<br />\nIn the opinion of some, the<br />\nHopkins Review was \"better than<br />\nany college magazine in the country.\" It had a national mailing<br />\nlist and sold out many issues.<br />\nFamous Names<br />\nThe fact is that The Hopkins<br />\nReview between 1949 and 1953<br />\nhad among its credits some<br />\nvery impressive literary figures.<br />\nAmong them were Kemp Malone, D.

In the first article,<br />\nwhich appeared in the March 13<br />\nissue, hypnotism was presented<br />\nfrom the amateur standpoint.<br />\nKeeping within the realm of the<br />\nHopkins community, we now<br />\npresent the views of two wellknown professional hypnotists.<br />\nThe News-Letter interviewed<br />\ntwo professional hypnotists who<br />\nwork within the Johns Hopkins<br />\ncommunity but whose reputations extend far beyond it. They<br />\nare Dr. G. Wilson Shaffer, professor of psychology and Director in the Hopkins Psychological<br />\nClinic as well as Dean of the<br />\nHomewood Schools, and Dr.<br />\nHarold Rosen, assistant professor<br />\nof psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.<br />\nIn Dr. Shaffer's words, \"Hypnotism is on an up-sweep. It is<br />\nan old therapeutic method which<br />\nhas enjoyed various cycles of<br />\npopularity and loss of popularity<br />\nsince its discovery. So far no<br />\nsatisfactory theory has been advi.nced that fully explains it.<br />\nThere are five or six theories<br />\nthat explain parts of it, but even<br />\ntogether they do not approach a<br />\nfull definition of it.\"<br />\nAsked his opinion on those<br />\nwho make use of hypnotism,<br />\nsometimes for its entertainment<br />\nqualities and sometimes for<br />\nworthwhile causes but without<br />\nproper training, Dr. Shaffer emphasized that \"it is a great mistake for amateurs to practice<br />\nhypnotism.\" He continued, \"It is<br />\nhard to determine the dangers,<br />\nbut amateurs make mistakes<br />\nthat professional men do not<br />\nThe very fact that hypnotism<br />\ngives one person authority over<br />\nanother make it dangerous in<br />\nthe wrong hands.\"<br />\nDr. Shaffer illustrated this by<br />\nstating that one of the most frequently seen symptoms in mental<br />\nillness is the fear and suspicion<br />\nof being influenced by someone<br />\nelse. This often becomes apparent when patients pick out<br />\nelements of their environment<br />\nand say that these elements have<br />\nauthority over them. An amateur hypnotist can easily become<br />\nthe object of such fears.<br />\nNot A Parlor Game<br />\nDr. Shaffer expressed strong<br />\nobjection to the use of hypnotism<br />\nfor demonstrations or entertainment. \"It is not a parlor game.<br />\nand people who use it as such<br />\ncan harm others physically and<br />\nmentally,\" he stressed. ,Using<br />\n\"GIVE A GIFT WITH A<br />\nJ.H.U.

Even viewers<br />\nnot involved in the demonstration can become scared and turn<br />\nsuspicious after watching hypnosis, although they do not realize it at first.<br />\npersonality<br />\nto<br />\nregard<br />\nIn<br />\nchanges via hypnotism, Dr. Shaffer stated that \"the danger lies<br />\nprecisely in the fact that one<br />\nperson decides on the change and<br />\ndoes not consider all the elements involved, such as recurrence of weaknesses in other<br />\nforms, etc.\" He pointed out that<br />\npersonalities are often changed<br />\nwithout the use of hypnotism<br />\nsince it is often only a matter<br />\nof bolstering the subject's confidence.<br />\nLack Self-Confidence<br />\n\"In general people lack selfconfidence . \u2022 . and those who<br />\nretreat often to hypnotism or<br />\nyoga aren't satisfied with ordisomewhat<br />\nlife, being<br />\nnary<br />\nschizophrenic,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Shaffer explained further:<br />\n\"For some people auto-hypnosis<br />\nis possible, but dangerous and<br />\nshould only be done under professional directions. Almost anything that can be done through<br />\nhypnosis can be done without it<br />\nunder the right circumstances.<br />\nStrong suggestions outside hypnosis frequently accomplish their<br />\npurpose if the therapist understands the psychodynamics involved and is an adept therapist.\"<br />\nAsked whether anyone can be<br />\nhypnotized and made to do anything against his principles, Dr.<br />\nShaffer replied: \"Yes, some who<br />\ndo not wish to be hypnotized can<br />\nbe in long and regular periods<br />\nwith a professional. But it is<br />\nmuch more difficult, and usually<br />\na person will wake up before doing certain things that are<br />\nagainst his principles.\"<br />\n\"You could say that making a<br />\nfool of oneself or playing the<br />\npiano in public is against one's<br />\nprinciples, but it is the major<br />\naggressive acts that will not<br />\nwork.\"<br />\nDr. Shaffer, who is doing re-<br /><br />\nsearch in abnormal psychology<br />\nat Hopkins as well as working<br />\nwith patients at the SheppardPratt Institute, cited a case<br />\nwhere a man was given a rubber knife and asked to stab the<br />\nhypnotist with it. He did so, but<br />\nwhen given a real knife and<br />\nasked to do the same he woke<br />\nup instead, \"One's visual acidity<br />\ncan be either increased or decreased by hypnosis,\" he explained.<br />\nHypnotism Misused<br />\nHypnotism is misused simply<br />\nbecause it is too simple, Dr.<br />\nShaffer said. A great number of<br />\npersons can perform it. The suggestibility of a subject is related<br />\nto his personality and rapport<br />\nwith the hypnotist.<br />\nDr. Shaffer also reported that<br />\na National Board of Examiners<br />\nhas been set up to certify those<br />\ncapab'.. as professional hypnotists, in either the clinical or<br />\nexperimental fields, or both. Dr<br />\nShaffer is a member of this<br />\nBoard and an associated editor<br />\nof the International Journal of<br />\nClinical and Experimental rypnosis.<br />\nWhen asked about the psychotherapeutic value of hypnosis.<br />\nDr. Rosen explained, 'Mere hypnosis by itself means nothing.<br />\nPhyscians who utilize hypnotic<br />\ntechnique need to know a great<br />\ndeal about psychodynamics.\"<br />\nThe Hypnotic Relationship<br />\n\"The hypnotic relationship,<br />\nwhatever else it is, is a relationship between two people.
