Taking into consideration the shortening of the field and<br />\nthis change in the rules, the kick<br />\nis lengthened by 5 yards.<br />\nEighth\u2014The field judge is eliminated; the head linesman will hereafter keep time and be judge of<br />\nthe official plays in the line of scrimmage.<br />\nNinth\u2014The number of men allowed on the side lines, formerly<br />\nthree, is reduced to one for each<br />\nteam.<br />\nTenth\u2014Provision is made that a<br />\nbouncing ball cannot score a legitimate goal.<br />\nEleventh\u2014The interval between<br />\nthe first and second and the third<br />\nand fourth periods is reduced from<br />\ntwo minutes to one minute. .<br />\n<br />\nTHE PROFESSORS' VACATIONS<br />\nWhere the Instructors Have Passed the<br />\nSummer Europe Very Popular.<br />\nMany Go to New England.<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\nProf. Bright spent most of his<br />\ntime here and at Blue Ridge Summit.

T.<br />\nO'Neill, for several years police<br />\njustice in the Eastern District of<br />\nthe city. The spontaneous applause<br />\nwhich greeted him after he had<br />\nfinished his talk showed that he had<br />\ndeeply impressed every man who<br />\nheard him. Although toward the<br />\nclose of his speech he was very<br />\nserious, calling on Hopkins men to<br />\nkeep the \"peanut politician\" from<br />\nobstructing the course of justice,<br />\nand urging them to give a helping<br />\nhand to .all persons in trouble, the<br />\nmain body of his speech was illuminated by true Irish wit. He made<br />\nno attempt to philosophize, but<br />\nsimply told of his experiences during the three years he was a justice,<br />\nwhen he handed out justice to<br />\n15,030 men, women and children,<br />\nbelonging to 26 different nationalities. Of these 15,000 he dismissed<br />\n8,000, because he believed that in<br />\neach case the criminals were penitent. One Jell, in listening to Mr.<br />\nO'Neill, that if there was any man<br />\nin the world who could make the<br />\nhardest criminal repent, it was he.<br />\nOne of the funniest stories the<br />\nJustice told was about a man who<br />\nwanted to get a divorce from his<br />\nwife because she would not serve<br />\nhim with soup. He called the wife,<br />\nwho was in Court with her husband, aside and told her to give the<br />\nman soup every day until further<br />\nnotice. He then sent the couple<br />\naway telling the husband to report<br />\nevery Sun-day how he was getting<br />\nalong. The first Sunday the man<br />\ncame in rubbing his hands and said,<br />\ndelightedly: \"Well, Judge, I've had<br />\nmy soup\u2014had it every day last<br />\nweek.\" The next week, when he<br />\ncame in, he said : \"I've had my soup<br />\nthis week,\" to which Justice O'Neill<br />\nreplied, \"I'm mighty glad of that.\"<br />\nThe third week the man came in<br />\nand said: \"Good Lord, can't you<br />\nmake that woman stop giving me<br />\nsoup?\" The Justice then notified<br />\nthe wife to stop the soup diet, and<br />\nthe couple lived happily ever after.<br />\n<br />\nTHE STATIONERS<br />\n<br />\n221<br />\n<br />\nE.

T.<br />\nO'Neill, for several years police<br />\njustice in the Eastern District of<br />\nthe city. The spontaneous applause<br />\nwhich greeted him after he had<br />\nfinished his talk showed that he had<br />\ndeeply impressed every man who<br />\nheard him. Although toward the<br />\nclose of his speech he was very<br />\nserious, calling on Hopkins men to<br />\nkeep the \"peanut politician\" from<br />\nobstructing the course of justice,<br />\nand urging them to give a helping<br />\nhand to .all persons in trouble, the<br />\nmain body of his speech was illuminated by true Irish wit. He made<br />\nno attempt to philosophize, but<br />\nsimply told of his experiences during the three years he was a justice,<br />\nwhen he handed out justice to<br />\n15,030 men, women and children,<br />\nbelonging to 26 different nationalities. Of these 15,000 he dismissed<br />\n8,000, because he believed that in<br />\neach case the criminals were penitent. One Jell, in listening to Mr.<br />\nO'Neill, that if there was any man<br />\nin the world who could make the<br />\nhardest criminal repent, it was he.<br />\nOne of the funniest stories the<br />\nJustice told was about a man who<br />\nwanted to get a divorce from his<br />\nwife because she would not serve<br />\nhim with soup. He called the wife,<br />\nwho was in Court with her husband, aside and told her to give the<br />\nman soup every day until further<br />\nnotice. He then sent the couple<br />\naway telling the husband to report<br />\nevery Sun-day how he was getting<br />\nalong. The first Sunday the man<br />\ncame in rubbing his hands and said,<br />\ndelightedly: \"Well, Judge, I've had<br />\nmy soup\u2014had it every day last<br />\nweek.\" The next week, when he<br />\ncame in, he said : \"I've had my soup<br />\nthis week,\" to which Justice O'Neill<br />\nreplied, \"I'm mighty glad of that.\"<br />\nThe third week the man came in<br />\nand said: \"Good Lord, can't you<br />\nmake that woman stop giving me<br />\nsoup?\" The Justice then notified<br />\nthe wife to stop the soup diet, and<br />\nthe couple lived happily ever after.<br /><br />\nTHE STATIONERS<br /><br />\n221<br /><br />\nE.
