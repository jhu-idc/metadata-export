/>\nof treating the country's Rolitical<br />\nailments, Tuesday evening in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nMcCarthy also told the<br />\naudience of 700 people that the<br />\nU.S. political system must<br />\nbecome open enough \\ to<br />\naccomodate third parties and<br />\nthat the dominance of the<br />\nmilitary and the giant<br />\ncorporations must be limited<br />\nbefore significant changes in the<br />\ncountry's social, political, and<br />\neconomic life can be effected.<br />\n.Congress<br />\nHis speech centered on the<br />\nidea that the President must once<br />\nagain govern with the other<br />\nbranches of the government as<br />\nprescribed by the Constitution<br />\nand that the Congress must<br />\nassume the role in the<br />\ngovernment that the Constitution<br />\nprovides.<br />\nAccording to McCarthy, Harry<br />\nTruman was the constitutional<br />\npresident of the United States,<br />\nthe last president to maintain his<br />\noffice in accordance with the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nPresidents Eisenhower,<br />\nKennedy, Johnson, and Nixon all<br />\nexecuted their offices without<br />\nregard for the separation of<br />\n<br />\npowers within the government,<br />\noften ignoring the Congress, as<br />\nevidenced in the negotiation of<br />\ntreaties, McCarthy contended.<br />\nIn addition, Presidents<br />\nJohnson and Nixon personalized<br />\nthe office to the extent that it<br />\nover- extended the bounds of the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\n\"Nixon's personalization went<br />\nto the point where he began to<br

/>\nserved as extensions of himself to<br />\nvarious positions in government<br />\ndemonstrated \"a lack of respect<br />\nfor the institutional relationships<br />\nand definitions that are<br

of<br />\nhomosexuals have often been<br />\nattributed \"solely to society's<br />\nattitudes.\" Two common<br />\nstereotypes exist, according to<br />\nBrown: that homosexuals are<br />\neffeminate, tending toward<br />\ntransvestism and that<br />\nhomosexuals sexually molest<br />\nchildren. \"The effeminate boy<br />\nrepresents society's<br />\nexpectations,\" he said. He<br />\npointed out that these<br />\nstereotypes play a large role in<br />\nthe lives of gay people and make<br />\nthe process of establishing an<br />\nidentity very difficult for<br />\nhomosexuals.<br />\nAnother problem that<br />\nhomosexuals encounter is rooted<br />\n<br />\npolicy of irresponsibility\" in the<br />\npast. The parties and<br />\nconsequently the Congress must<br />\nmake a committment to insure<br />\nthat the legislative branch gets<br />\nand uses the power which is<br />\nrightfully its own, according to<br />\nthe Constitution.<br />\nIn his speech he denounced<br />\nthe recently enacted law for<br />\nfederal financing of national<br />\nelections, claiming that the law<br />\ndiscourages and discriminates<br />\nagainst third parties.<br />\n\"As we approach 1976, we<br />\nhave to give some very hard<br />\nthought to the process of<br />\npolitics.

The answer is a<br />\nmost definite \"yes,\" and the band<br />\nmembers themselves feel they're as<br />\ngood as ever.<br />\nQuestions such as the one above<br />\nwere prompted by the loss of<br />\ncertain members of the group at<br />\nthe end of last year.

Liefmann,<br />\nHarvey, Barbera, and Ms. Haraway<br />\nin their statement condemning the<br />\nnew admissions policy at the MSE<br />\nLibrary. Several facts should be<br />\nbrought to their attention, and to<br />\nthe attention of everyone at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe MSE Library is not a public<br />\nlibrary, such as Enoch Pratt, but a<br />\nprivately funded researchlibrary<br />\ndesigned (and financed) to meet the<br />\nneeds of a specific clientele, the<br />\nHopkins community. The move to<br />\ncontrolled admissions was not an<br />\nattempt to further consolidate<br />\nHopkins' stranglehold on recorded<br />\nknowledge, but to cut down on<br />\nlibrary operating costs and hence<br />\nto offer more complete services to<br />\nthe Hopkins community who pay<br />\nfor the library.<br />\nCitizens in the community at<br />\nlarge were previously allowed to<br />\nmake use of all serives available in<br />\nthe library with the exception of<br />\nborrowing. Not the least of these<br />\nservices was the subsidized<br />\nxeroxing. (S.05) The cumulative<br />\neffect of open admissions is not<br />\nonly a financial drain on such<br />\nservices, including staff processing<br />\nof books, but a long range drain on<br />\nthe supply of books available. If<br />\nbooks must be replaced more<br />\noften, because of added handling,<br />\nthere is less money available for<br />\nnew ones. It is as simple as that. If<br />\nthe members in the community at<br />\nlarge wish to use our private<br />\nlibrary, they should be willing to<br />\nhelp support it financially. This<br />\narrangement is fully provided for<br />\nin the new policy. For a fee ,,of<br />\n$100 per year, the doors to MSE<br />\nfly open for the non-Hopkins<br />\ncommunity member. In addition<br />\ninter-library loan provisions and<br />\ncooperative research exist between<br />\nHopkins and most colleges and<br />\nuniversities in the area. If the MSE<br />\nhas a book not available in other<br />\ncollege libraries in the region, a<br />\nletter from the librarian of the<br />\nstudent's institution will admit the<br />\nstudent. The MSE has been used<br />\nby the community as a social area,<br />\na study hall, and a xerox terminal.<br />\nWhat all this means is that anyone<br />\nwho wishes to research materials<br />\navailable exclusively in the MSE<br />\ncan usually find a way. We only<br />\nwish to exclude persons who<br />\nmisuse the library.<br />\n<br />\nkihd. of<br />\n<br />\nUniversity offers.

You mean Senator<br />\nEugene McCarthy? Didn't he almost run<br />\nfor the Presidency in 1968? Is he the one<br />\nwho was the hero of thousands of campus<br />\nradicals and liberals in the late '60's? Oh<br />\nyeah. Out of office? Since 1970? No, I<br />\ndidn't know that. And he's speaking at<br />\nShriver? Great.<br />\nBig press conference with McCarthy<br />\nWednesday afternoon. The Baltimore Sun<br />\nhas been notified; there should be lots of<br />\nreporters and maybe eVen television<br />\ncameras\u2014 and us, the Newsletter boys.<br />\nWell, the press conference wasn't all it<br />\nwas jacked-up to be. There were no<br />\nreporters from the Sun, no television<br />\ncameras, no crowds. Just us. We met with<br />\nthe Senator and his entourage in the<br />\nBoard Room in Shriver, and sat down to<br />\na thirty minute conference with him. The<br />\nSenator spoke quietly, in a very subdued<br />\nnature. I noticed a lack of eye contact on<br />\nhis part as we spoke with him; he toyed<br />\nwith a glass of water,looked at the table,<br />\nand occasionally, as if preemptorily,<br />\nlooked us in the eye. On this account, the<br />\nconference was a bit of a disappointment.<br />\nI had expected an energetic,<br />\nfire-in-the-eyes type\u2014maybe I shouldn't<br />\nhave. The Senator has, after all, been out<br />\nof the limelight for four years.<br />\nHowever, he told us, he wants to get<br />\nback into the center ring; he intends to<br />\nrun for the Presidency in 1976. On which<br />\nticket does he intend to run? The<br />\nIndependent, he says. Do you really think<br />\n<br />\nEugene McCartny<br />\nyou can win as an Independent? Won't he<br />\nhook. And even after Nixon's<br />\njust be drawing votes from the other<br />\n\"acceptance\" of the pardon, which in<br />\ncandidates? No, he thinks he can win.<br />\nitself implied guilt, Nixon himself made<br />\nOptimistic? Very. Realistic? Well, we'll<br />\nno admission of guilt. If this isn't<br />\nsee in '76.<br />\narrogance, Senator, what is? Where is<br />\nInevitably, the questioning turned to<br />\nyour concept of equal justice for all?<br />\nWatergate--more specifically, to President<br />\nRegardles, on the Shriver Wednesday<br />\nFord's pardoning of Richard Nixon. The<br />\nnight.<br />\nSenator really took me by surprise on this<br />\nThe Senator drew a good crowd, in<br />\none. He expressed his feelings that Nixon<br />\ncontrast to the press conference. He was<br />\nhad to be pardoned sometime. He<br />\nsharp, witty, and a delight to listen to. He<br />\nobjected only to Ford's timing and<br />\nconcerned himself mainly with trends in<br />\nexplanation of the pardon, calling it<br />\nthe use, concepts, and responsibilities of<br />\n\"inept\". How could you do this to me<br />\nthe Presidency.<br />\nSenator? You were my conception of the<br />\nTracing the Presidency from the<br />\nliberal of liberals\u2014now who can I look<br />\nTruman administration to the Present,<br />\nto? Had to be pardoned 34 What\u2022 entitled<br />\nMcCarthy pointed out how, as time<br />\nRichard Nixon to a pardon? He hadn't<br />\nprogressed, the Presidents showed<br />\neven been indicted by the Watergate<br />\ndiminishing concern for the relationship<br />\ngrand jury, when already he was off the<br />\nbetween the executive and the judicial<br />\n<br />\nand legislative branches. The Presidents<br />\ngradually drew power from them,<br />\nultimately resulting in an<br />\nover-concentration of power in the<br />\nexecutive branch.<br />\nMcCarthy cited President Johnson's<br />\n\"personalization\" of the office in his<br />\nreferring to the Cabinet as \"my Cabinet\".<br />\nShowing great disrespect for the Supreme<br />\nCourt Justices, he used one of them as his<br />\npersonal lawyer. Johnson also appointed<br />\nthe Chief Justice to head the Warren<br />\nCommission's investigation into the<br />\nassassination of President Kennedy,<br />\n\u2022 clearly an extra-judicial function. These<br />\ninstances point out an outright weakening<br />\nof the separate functions of the different<br />\ninstitutions of the government.<br />\nThe Senator was exceptionally tough<br />\non President Nixon. Nixon's \"incursion\"<br />\ninto Cambodia, without the approval of<br />\nCongress, took this usurpation of power<br />\neven further. When we saw how he uses<br />\nthe Watergate Plumbers Unit, the<br />\nAmerican public saw that the office of<br />\nthe Presidency, not only Richard Nixon,<br />\nwas getting out of hand.<br />\nObviously we have to get the country<br />\nback into shape. The Senator suggested<br />\nthat before we go into the 1976 election,<br />\nthe definition of the office of the<br />\nPresidency, the sharing of responsibility<br />\nand power, and how the President may<br />\nuse his power within the restraints of the<br />\nConstitution be reevaluated.

Much to the<br />\nembarassment of the alderman, the area<br />\nbecame known as Storyville. Sporting<br />\nhouses and high class 'mansions'<br />\nflourished here until 1917, when the<br />\nNavy closed the District down for good.<br />\nMusic had always played an important<br />\nrole in New Orleans society, and it<br />\nbecame the custom in Storyville for<br />\nmadams to hire pianists to entertain and,<br />\nin a sense, accompany their guests.<br />\nBecause of this great demand for talented<br />\npianists, New Orleans soon became a<br />\nhaven for musicians.<br />\nBlues Boy<br />\n<br />\nOne of the most gifted products of this<br />\nmusically Stimulating environment was<br />\nFerdinand 'Jelly Roll' Morton. Born in<br />\n1886 and raised in New Orleans, Morton<br />\ngained exposure to diverse styles of<br />\nmusic\u2014 ragtime, blues and opera, as well<br />\nas Spanish and French music. At fourteen<br />\nhe was working as a 'professor'(pianist)<br />\nin sporting houses throughout the<br />\ndistrict, and by 1902 was recognized as<br />\none of the finest pianists in New Orleans.<br />\nAround 1905, however, business in the<br />\n<br />\nmansions slacked off and Morton found<br />\nhimself out of a job. It was at this time<br />\nthat he began organizing his own small<br />\nbands.<br />\nThis was fortunate, indeed; for it was<br />\nas a bandleader that Morton exerted his<br />\nmost radical influence. He was the first<br />\njazz musician to write down his band<br />\narrangements in musical notation; and<br />\neven today his arrangements remain<br />\nmodels of sophistication and balance<br />\nwithin the jazz orchestra. Morton has<br />\nbeen called,\" the first jazz intellectual\"<br />\nand \"the first great jazz composer\", but<br />\nhis recorded band performances<br />\nconstitute his most enduring contribution<br />\nto American music. These performances<br />\nare even more remarkable in view of the<br />\nfact that the bands which Morton used<br />\nfor recording dates were pickup groups;<br />\nhe would show his men the effects he<br />\nwanted,they would rehearse for a few<br />\nhours and then record.<br />\n<br />\nof Morton's finest recorded work . Two<br />\nof these performances are by Wilton<br />\nCrawley and his orchestra; they are vastly<br />\ninferior to the rest but are included only<br />\nbecause Morton is the pianist. Eleven of<br />\nthe sixteen selections are Morton<br />\ncompositions.<br />\nThese recordings typify the<br />\ncharacteristic qualities of Mort's work:<br />\nvariety, contrast and balance. Anexample<br />\nis \"Red Hot Pepper-Stomp,\" which is no<br />\ndoubt one of Morton's most varied<br />\nrrecordings. Here Morton proves himself<br />\nmaster of the jazz orchestra. In this<br />\nmonaural recording, he blends ten<br />\ninstruments like a wizard, using<br />\ncontrasting solos, varied backgrounds,<br />\nsingle and double breaks for different<br />\ncombinations and of course his own<br />\nincomparable piano, winding it up with a<br />\nfinal exuberant ensemble chorus. This<br />\nrecording swings..<br />\nCountry Pie<br />\n<br />\nkeep up with her constitutes an<br />\nachievement in itself.<br />\nIn \"Deep Creek Blues\" Morton uses<br />\nsustained backgrounds behind lytical<br />\nsolos, creating a fabric of sound. He<br />\nexplores different ensemble combinations<br />\nto create a wide range of orchestral<br />\ncolors.<br />\nThis collection also includes two 1927<br />\nselections by the Jelly Roll Morton .Trio<br />\n(Johnny Dodds\u2014 clarinet, Jelly Roll<br />\nMorton\u2014piano, Warren\"Baby\"<br />\nDodds\u2014drums). \"Wolverines\" and \"Mr.<br />\nJelly Lord\" are among the finest jazz<br />\ntrios on /record. These are trios in the<br />\nfullest sense of the word\u2014each<br />\ninstrument blends into a perfect<br />\nhomogeneous whole, rather than solo and<br />\naccompaniment. This is in part a<br />\nmanifestation of Morton's remarkable gift<br />\nfor counterpoint which made him one of<br />\nthe finest orchestral, as well as small<br />\ncombo, pianists in jazz history. This<br />\ngroup, incidentally, was one of the first,<br />\nif not the first, clarinet-piano-drum trios<br />\non record, long before the Benny<br />\nGoodman Trio, which was presented as<br />\nan innovation before the public, and<br />\nwhose performances always remained<br />\nbelow those of the Morton Trio. There is<br />\nalso included in this set an alternate take<br />\nof \"Wolverines,\" previously unissued.<br />\n<br />\n\"When They Get Lovin' \" is a vocal<br />\nblues with piano accompaniment. This is<br />\ntruly one of Morton's most sensitive and<br />\nunder exclusive contract with the Victor<br />\nmoving accompaniments. Unfortunately<br />\nRecording Company, and it was for<br />\nvocalist, Miss Billie Young, was an<br />\nthe<br />\nVictor that he recorded some of his<br />\ngirl by trade and her performance<br />\noffice<br />\ngreatest masterpieces.

Last year's Spring Fair, \"3400<br />\nOn Stage,\" incurred a deficit of<br />\nroughly $2300 largely because of<br />\nthe circus the Fair sponsored and<br />\nbecause of over-expenditures in<br />\ncertain areas, Sue Blum, 1974<br />\nFair chairwoman, announced<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nThe circus lost $3000 Blum<br />\nrevealed and was far and away<br />\nthe largest single factor in<br />\ndragging the Fair budget down<br />\ninto the red. The circus was<br />\ncontracted in January for $3500<br />\nand was initially signed, in part,<br />\nas a money-making venture for<br />\nthe Fair.<br />\nBlum explained that after the<br />\ncircus, the principal cause for the<br />\ndefecit was the unauthorized<br />\nexpenditures made by various<br />\nmembers of the Fair Board.<br />\n\"People who were not<br />\nauthorized to spend did so,<br />\nespecially students involved in<br />\nsecurity and plant planning,\"<br />\nBlum said. Because unauthorized<br />\nexpenditures were made, neither<br />\nshe nor budget chairwoman<br />\nAbby Preschel could keep an<br />\naccurate count of just how much<br />\nmoney was being spent.<br />\nBlum stated, \"I take partial<br />\nresponsibility for the financial<br />\nlosses, although alot of it was<br />\nbeyond my control.\"<br />\nExpenditures on security and<br />\nplant planning ran $1700 over<br />\nthe original budget allotment,<br />\nalthough roughly $700 of the<br />\noverrun was anticipated for<br />\ncapital investments and will be<br />\ncovered by this year's Fair<br />\nbt`I' dget.<br />\nPreschel asserted that she had<br />\nmade it clear to the people on<br />\nthe Fair Board that all<br />\nexpenditures should be cleared<br />\nthrough her.<br />\nHowever, she claimed that<br />\noften people \"had things cleared<br />\nthrough me after someone else<br />\nhad cleared it and the<br />\nexpenditure had been made.\"<br />\n\"We told everybody how<br />\nMuch they were allotted to<br /><br />\nspend, but at the last minute,<br />\nthings cropped up,\" she<br />\ncontinued.<br />\nPreschel indicated that Charles<br />\nBurhan, who was one of the two<br />\nstudents in charge of security and<br />\nplant planning was one Fair<br />\nBoard member who did make<br />\nsome unauthorized expenditures.<br />\nShe added that much equipment<br /><br />\nwas lost by Burhan, adding<br />\nadditional expenses to the Fair.<br />\nPreschel also admitted that she<br />\nis \"responsible for alot of it [the<br />\ncost overrun].\"<br />\nBurhan disclosed that he<br />\nbelieves he \"could have done a<br />\nbetter job.\"<br />\n\"With greater effort, I could<br />\nhave cut down on many overall<br /><br />\ncosts,\" he stated.<br />\nHe added, though, that \"we<br />\nhad overruns in terms of what<br />\nwas originally budgeted, not<br />\nwhat was expected.\"<br />\nThe major expense incurred by<br />\nthe plant operations was the<br />\nlaying of electrical cables for<br />\npower for food booths spread<br />\nout over the campus.<br /><br />\nMcCarthy calls for federal power balance<br />\nFormer U.S. Senator Eugene<br />\nMcCarthy called for a restoration<br />\nof the Constitutional balance of<br />\npowers in the federal government<br />\nthrough a decrease in the power<br />\nof the Presidency as one means<br />\nof treating the country's Rolitical<br />\nailments, Tuesday evening in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nMcCarthy also told the<br />\naudience of 700 people that the<br />\nU.S. political system must<br />\nbecome open enough \\ to<br />\naccomodate third parties and<br />\nthat the dominance of the<br />\nmilitary and the giant<br />\ncorporations must be limited<br />\nbefore significant changes in the<br />\ncountry's social, political, and<br />\neconomic life can be effected.<br />\n.Congress<br />\nHis speech centered on the<br />\nidea that the President must once<br />\nagain govern with the other<br />\nbranches of the government as<br />\nprescribed by the Constitution<br />\nand that the Congress must<br />\nassume the role in the<br />\ngovernment that the Constitution<br />\nprovides.<br />\nAccording to McCarthy, Harry<br />\nTruman was the constitutional<br />\npresident of the United States,<br />\nthe last president to maintain his<br />\noffice in accordance with the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nPresidents Eisenhower,<br />\nKennedy, Johnson, and Nixon all<br />\nexecuted their offices without<br />\nregard for the separation of<br /><br />\npowers within the government,<br />\noften ignoring the Congress, as<br />\nevidenced in the negotiation of<br />\ntreaties, McCarthy contended.<br />\nIn addition, Presidents<br />\nJohnson and Nixon personalized<br />\nthe office to the extent that it<br />\nover- extended the bounds of the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\n\"Nixon's personalization went<br />\nto the point where he began to<br />\nsuggest that all governmental<br />\ninstitutions should be a<br />\nprojection of his person,\" noted<br />\nMcCarthy.<br />\nNixon's appointments of<br />\npersonal associates who merely<br />\nserved as extensions of himself to<br />\nvarious positions in government<br />\ndemonstrated \"a lack of respect<br />\nfor the institutional relationships<br />\nand definitions that are<br />\nfundamental to the operation of<br />\nthe American Constitutional<br />\nsystem,\" he continued.<br />\nHe also observed, though, that<br />\nthe Congress has \"followed a<br /><br />\nregard one's self as a homosexual.<br />\nCiting the example of frequent<br />\nhomosexual acts in prisons and<br />\nmental institutions, Brown<br />\nemphasized that\"most of these<br />\nmen are bi-sexual.\"<br />\n\"Sexual and affectional<br />\npreferences\" are what<br />\ndistinguished a homosexual,<br />\naccording to Brown.<br />\nHe continued by explaining<br />\nthat the problems of<br />\nhomosexuals have often been<br />\nattributed \"solely to society's<br />\nattitudes.\" Two common<br />\nstereotypes exist, according to<br />\nBrown: that homosexuals are<br />\neffeminate, tending toward<br />\ntransvestism and that<br />\nhomosexuals sexually molest<br />\nchildren. \"The effeminate boy<br />\nrepresents society's<br />\nexpectations,\" he said. He<br />\npointed out that these<br />\nstereotypes play a large role in<br />\nthe lives of gay people and make<br />\nthe process of establishing an<br />\nidentity very difficult for<br />\nhomosexuals.<br />\nAnother problem that<br />\nhomosexuals encounter is rooted<br /><br />\npolicy of irresponsibility\" in the<br />\npast.

Those involved with the proposal<br />\npoint to it as the solution to various problems, to wit, widespread misconceptions about the Hopkins undergraduate program, the supposed decline in the quality of the student body<br />\nhere, and the lack of financial aid reserves for middle income<br />\nfamilies.

The answer is a<br />\nmost definite \"yes,\" and the band<br />\nmembers themselves feel they're as<br />\ngood as ever.<br />\nQuestions such as the one above<br />\nwere prompted by the loss of<br />\ncertain members of the group at<br />\nthe end of last year.

Liefmann,<br />\nHarvey, Barbera, and Ms. Haraway<br />\nin their statement condemning the<br />\nnew admissions policy at the MSE<br />\nLibrary. Several facts should be<br />\nbrought to their attention, and to<br />\nthe attention of everyone at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe MSE Library is not a public<br />\nlibrary, such as Enoch Pratt, but a<br />\nprivately funded researchlibrary<br />\ndesigned (and financed) to meet the<br />\nneeds of a specific clientele, the<br />\nHopkins community. The move to<br />\ncontrolled admissions was not an<br />\nattempt to further consolidate<br />\nHopkins' stranglehold on recorded<br />\nknowledge, but to cut down on<br />\nlibrary operating costs and hence<br />\nto offer more complete services to<br />\nthe Hopkins community who pay<br />\nfor the library.<br />\nCitizens in the community at<br />\nlarge were previously allowed to<br />\nmake use of all serives available in<br />\nthe library with the exception of<br />\nborrowing. Not the least of these<br />\nservices was the subsidized<br />\nxeroxing. (S.05) The cumulative<br />\neffect of open admissions is not<br />\nonly a financial drain on such<br />\nservices, including staff processing<br />\nof books, but a long range drain on<br />\nthe supply of books available. If<br />\nbooks must be replaced more<br />\noften, because of added handling,<br />\nthere is less money available for<br />\nnew ones. It is as simple as that. If<br />\nthe members in the community at<br />\nlarge wish to use our private<br />\nlibrary, they should be willing to<br />\nhelp support it financially. This<br />\narrangement is fully provided for<br />\nin the new policy. For a fee ,,of<br />\n$100 per year, the doors to MSE<br />\nfly open for the non-Hopkins<br />\ncommunity member. In addition<br />\ninter-library loan provisions and<br />\ncooperative research exist between<br />\nHopkins and most colleges and<br />\nuniversities in the area. If the MSE<br />\nhas a book not available in other<br />\ncollege libraries in the region, a<br />\nletter from the librarian of the<br />\nstudent's institution will admit the<br />\nstudent.

Now, however, our<br />\ntime has come to act against<br />\nrepression, suppression, depression<br />\nand sloth. A devious, underhanded,<br />\nfacist conspiracy has been brought<br />\nto light. It is a plot orchestrated by<br />\nour government and the powers<br />\nthat be, and by our silence we condone it.

You mean Senator<br />\nEugene McCarthy? Didn't he almost run<br />\nfor the Presidency in 1968? Is he the one<br />\nwho was the hero of thousands of campus<br />\nradicals and liberals in the late '60's? Oh<br />\nyeah. Out of office? Since 1970? No, I<br />\ndidn't know that. And he's speaking at<br />\nShriver? Great.<br />\nBig press conference with McCarthy<br />\nWednesday afternoon. The Baltimore Sun<br />\nhas been notified; there should be lots of<br />\nreporters and maybe eVen television<br />\ncameras\u2014 and us, the Newsletter boys.<br />\nWell, the press conference wasn't all it<br />\nwas jacked-up to be. There were no<br />\nreporters from the Sun, no television<br />\ncameras, no crowds. Just us. We met with<br />\nthe Senator and his entourage in the<br />\nBoard Room in Shriver, and sat down to<br />\na thirty minute conference with him. The<br />\nSenator spoke quietly, in a very subdued<br />\nnature. I noticed a lack of eye contact on<br />\nhis part as we spoke with him; he toyed<br />\nwith a glass of water,looked at the table,<br />\nand occasionally, as if preemptorily,<br />\nlooked us in the eye. On this account, the<br />\nconference was a bit of a disappointment.<br />\nI had expected an energetic,<br />\nfire-in-the-eyes type\u2014maybe I shouldn't<br />\nhave. The Senator has, after all, been out<br />\nof the limelight for four years.<br />\nHowever, he told us, he wants to get<br />\nback into the center ring; he intends to<br />\nrun for the Presidency in 1976. On which<br />\nticket does he intend to run? The<br />\nIndependent, he says. Do you really think<br /><br />\nEugene McCartny<br />\nyou can win as an Independent? Won't he<br />\nhook. And even after Nixon's<br />\njust be drawing votes from the other<br />\n\"acceptance\" of the pardon, which in<br />\ncandidates? No, he thinks he can win.<br />\nitself implied guilt, Nixon himself made<br />\nOptimistic? Very. Realistic? Well, we'll<br />\nno admission of guilt. If this isn't<br />\nsee in '76.<br />\narrogance, Senator, what is? Where is<br />\nInevitably, the questioning turned to<br />\nyour concept of equal justice for all?<br />\nWatergate--more specifically, to President<br />\nRegardles, on the Shriver Wednesday<br />\nFord's pardoning of Richard Nixon. The<br />\nnight.<br />\nSenator really took me by surprise on this<br />\nThe Senator drew a good crowd, in<br />\none. He expressed his feelings that Nixon<br />\ncontrast to the press conference. He was<br />\nhad to be pardoned sometime. He<br />\nsharp, witty, and a delight to listen to. He<br />\nobjected only to Ford's timing and<br />\nconcerned himself mainly with trends in<br />\nexplanation of the pardon, calling it<br />\nthe use, concepts, and responsibilities of<br />\n\"inept\". How could you do this to me<br />\nthe Presidency.<br />\nSenator? You were my conception of the<br />\nTracing the Presidency from the<br />\nliberal of liberals\u2014now who can I look<br />\nTruman administration to the Present,<br />\nto? Had to be pardoned 34 What\u2022 entitled<br />\nMcCarthy pointed out how, as time<br />\nRichard Nixon to a pardon? He hadn't<br />\nprogressed, the Presidents showed<br />\neven been indicted by the Watergate<br />\ndiminishing concern for the relationship<br />\ngrand jury, when already he was off the<br />\nbetween the executive and the judicial<br /><br />\nand legislative branches. The Presidents<br />\ngradually drew power from them,<br />\nultimately resulting in an<br />\nover-concentration of power in the<br />\nexecutive branch.<br />\nMcCarthy cited President Johnson's<br />\n\"personalization\" of the office in his<br />\nreferring to the Cabinet as \"my Cabinet\".<br />\nShowing great disrespect for the Supreme<br />\nCourt Justices, he used one of them as his<br />\npersonal lawyer. Johnson also appointed<br />\nthe Chief Justice to head the Warren<br />\nCommission's investigation into the<br />\nassassination of President Kennedy,<br />\n\u2022 clearly an extra-judicial function. These<br />\ninstances point out an outright weakening<br />\nof the separate functions of the different<br />\ninstitutions of the government.<br />\nThe Senator was exceptionally tough<br />\non President Nixon. Nixon's \"incursion\"<br />\ninto Cambodia, without the approval of<br />\nCongress, took this usurpation of power<br />\neven further. When we saw how he uses<br />\nthe Watergate Plumbers Unit, the<br />\nAmerican public saw that the office of<br />\nthe Presidency, not only Richard Nixon,<br />\nwas getting out of hand.<br />\nObviously we have to get the country<br />\nback into shape. The Senator suggested<br />\nthat before we go into the 1976 election,<br />\nthe definition of the office of the<br />\nPresidency, the sharing of responsibility<br />\nand power, and how the President may<br />\nuse his power within the restraints of the<br />\nConstitution be reevaluated.

Much to the<br />\nembarassment of the alderman, the area<br />\nbecame known as Storyville. Sporting<br />\nhouses and high class 'mansions'<br />\nflourished here until 1917, when the<br />\nNavy closed the District down for good.<br />\nMusic had always played an important<br />\nrole in New Orleans society, and it<br />\nbecame the custom in Storyville for<br />\nmadams to hire pianists to entertain and,<br />\nin a sense, accompany their guests.<br />\nBecause of this great demand for talented<br />\npianists, New Orleans soon became a<br />\nhaven for musicians.<br />\nBlues Boy<br /><br />\nOne of the most gifted products of this<br />\nmusically Stimulating environment was<br />\nFerdinand 'Jelly Roll' Morton. Born in<br />\n1886 and raised in New Orleans, Morton<br />\ngained exposure to diverse styles of<br />\nmusic\u2014 ragtime, blues and opera, as well<br />\nas Spanish and French music. At fourteen<br />\nhe was working as a 'professor'(pianist)<br />\nin sporting houses throughout the<br />\ndistrict, and by 1902 was recognized as<br />\none of the finest pianists in New Orleans.<br />\nAround 1905, however, business in the<br /><br />\nmansions slacked off and Morton found<br />\nhimself out of a job. It was at this time<br />\nthat he began organizing his own small<br />\nbands.<br />\nThis was fortunate, indeed; for it was<br />\nas a bandleader that Morton exerted his<br />\nmost radical influence. He was the first<br />\njazz musician to write down his band<br />\narrangements in musical notation; and<br />\neven today his arrangements remain<br />\nmodels of sophistication and balance<br />\nwithin the jazz orchestra. Morton has<br />\nbeen called,\" the first jazz intellectual\"<br />\nand \"the first great jazz composer\", but<br />\nhis recorded band performances<br />\nconstitute his most enduring contribution<br />\nto American music. These performances<br />\nare even more remarkable in view of the<br />\nfact that the bands which Morton used<br />\nfor recording dates were pickup groups;<br />\nhe would show his men the effects he<br />\nwanted,they would rehearse for a few<br />\nhours and then record.<br /><br />\nof Morton's finest recorded work . Two<br />\nof these performances are by Wilton<br />\nCrawley and his orchestra; they are vastly<br />\ninferior to the rest but are included only<br />\nbecause Morton is the pianist. Eleven of<br />\nthe sixteen selections are Morton<br />\ncompositions.<br />\nThese recordings typify the<br />\ncharacteristic qualities of Mort's work:<br />\nvariety, contrast and balance. Anexample<br />\nis \"Red Hot Pepper-Stomp,\" which is no<br />\ndoubt one of Morton's most varied<br />\nrrecordings. Here Morton proves himself<br />\nmaster of the jazz orchestra. In this<br />\nmonaural recording, he blends ten<br />\ninstruments like a wizard, using<br />\ncontrasting solos, varied backgrounds,<br />\nsingle and double breaks for different<br />\ncombinations and of course his own<br />\nincomparable piano, winding it up with a<br />\nfinal exuberant ensemble chorus. This<br />\nrecording swings..<br />\nCountry Pie<br /><br />\nkeep up with her constitutes an<br />\nachievement in itself.<br />\nIn \"Deep Creek Blues\" Morton uses<br />\nsustained backgrounds behind lytical<br />\nsolos, creating a fabric of sound. He<br />\nexplores different ensemble combinations<br />\nto create a wide range of orchestral<br />\ncolors.<br />\nThis collection also includes two 1927<br />\nselections by the Jelly Roll Morton .Trio<br />\n(Johnny Dodds\u2014 clarinet, Jelly Roll<br />\nMorton\u2014piano, Warren\"Baby\"<br />\nDodds\u2014drums). \"Wolverines\" and \"Mr.<br />\nJelly Lord\" are among the finest jazz<br />\ntrios on /record. These are trios in the<br />\nfullest sense of the word\u2014each<br />\ninstrument blends into a perfect<br />\nhomogeneous whole, rather than solo and<br />\naccompaniment. This is in part a<br />\nmanifestation of Morton's remarkable gift<br />\nfor counterpoint which made him one of<br />\nthe finest orchestral, as well as small<br />\ncombo, pianists in jazz history. This<br />\ngroup, incidentally, was one of the first,<br />\nif not the first, clarinet-piano-drum trios<br />\non record, long before the Benny<br />\nGoodman Trio, which was presented as<br />\nan innovation before the public, and<br />\nwhose performances always remained<br />\nbelow those of the Morton Trio. There is<br />\nalso included in this set an alternate take<br />\nof \"Wolverines,\" previously unissued.<br /><br />\n\"When They Get Lovin' \" is a vocal<br />\nblues with piano accompaniment. This is<br />\ntruly one of Morton's most sensitive and<br />\nunder exclusive contract with the Victor<br />\nmoving accompaniments. Unfortunately<br />\nRecording Company, and it was for<br />\nvocalist, Miss Billie Young, was an<br />\nthe<br />\nVictor that he recorded some of his<br />\ngirl by trade and her performance<br />\noffice<br />\ngreatest masterpieces.
