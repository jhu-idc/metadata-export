The<br />\nAlumni Network, which is<br />\ndesigned as an information service rather than a 'job network,\" presently has about 50<br />\nlistings. The service is to<br />\nbecome a permanent part of the<br />\noffice's operations, which include sponsoring visits from<br />\nrecruiting businesses and graduate schools; resume and interview technique workshops; listings of part-time, full-time and<br />\nsummer jobs; individual consultations for resume writing<br />\nand career objectives; basic information services and handling the credentials for teaching<br />\npositions.<br />\nThe Alumni Network was initiated last December when the<br />\nAlumni Relations Office, in<br />\nconjunction with the Placement<br />\nOffice, placed an advertisement<br />\nin Johns Hopkins magazine entreating graduates to send in<br />\nbrief biographies including<br />\neducation and employment information. These forms are<br />\npresently filed alphabetically in<br />\nthe Placement.Office.<br />\nThe cards are designed to be<br />\nused by students to obtain information and advice from<br />\nalumni who have experience in<br />\na given career, or .are with a<br />\ngraduate institution. For instance, there is a card from a<br />\n1963 social science graduate<br />\nwho had 14 years of experience<br />\nas a resident and businessman<br />\nin Europe. Another card was<br />\nsent in by a Hopkins undergraduate who is presently<br />\nemployed as a producer of<br />\nprivate video programming for<br />\nthe corporate sector.<br />\n<br />\nThe office also handles visits<br />\nfrom corporations who actively recruit students for employment. Most of these companies<br />\nare in the fields of engineering,<br />\nbanking, insurance or management. Baughan notes that the<br />\nnumber of visits is increasing.<br />\nDuring the 1977-78 academic<br />\nyear, there were 60 company<br />\nvisits; last year there were 115.<br />\nThe increase is partly due to<br />\na nationwide increase in recruiting and partly due to<br />\nBaughan's own initiative.

She feels that this individual attention is somewhat<br />\nunique. It is important because<br />\nstudents learn to write resumes<br />\ncorrectly, as well as getting tips<br />\non cover letters and interview<br />\ntechniques. This is information<br />\nthat they can use throughout<br />\ntheir lives whenever they apply<br />\nfor a new job.<br />\nMany schools send out books<br />\nof students' resumes to prospective employers.

Sponh\\ Rep. >olonihm R<br />\nso!<br />\nNY), the law, which takes etfeet on May 1, requires all<br />\nfinancial aid recipients to provide their draft papers before<br />\nthey can be considered eligible.<br />\nAttendance at the meeting<br />\nwas slim, but this was attributed to poor advertising rather<br />\nthan lack of interest. \"The majority of Hopkins students receive some kind of financial<br />\naid, so it is inconceivable that<br />\nthey are not concerned about<br />\nthis issue,\" said Phillip<br />\nSchmandt, one of those in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nAt this time there is no<br />\norganized group on campus<br />\nwhich formally protests the<br />\nlaw, but several students receive<br />\ncorrespondence from national<br />\norganizations like CARD(Committee Against Registration and<br />\nDraft) and the U.S. Student<br />\nAssociation. Schmandt also<br />\nsaid that he and others have<br />\nbeen in contact with Hopkins<br />\nFinancial Aid Director Susan<br />\nBroadbent, and that she is<br />\n\"supportive\" of the cause here<br />\non campus. Schmandt added<br />\nthat at Yale University,<br />\nadministrators have said that<br />\nthe university will replace any<br />\nfinancial assistance that the<br />\ngovernment takes away from<br />\n<br />\nat anti-draft registration meeting.<br />\nPhil Schmandt (right) leads discussion<br />\n<br />\nstudents as a result of the new<br />\nlaw. Schmandt feels that this is<br />\n\"definitely a positive step,\" but<br />\nnoted that such a move here at<br />\nHopkins is \"highly unlikely.\"<br />\nSchmandt c;.els that although<br />\nadministrators here would not<br />\nmake such a move, they have<br />\nreason to be against the law<br />\nanyway. According to Schmandt,<br />\nthe new law would lead to<br />\nmuch confusion and increased<br />\npaperwork. Students would be<br />\nrequired to submit a draft<br />\npaper which, he feels, many<br />\npeople have \"lost or thrown<br />\naway.\" In addition, some confusion might occur as a result<br />\nof students' not realizing just<br />\nwhat the law means.<br />\nAccording to Schmandt, the<br />\nmajor goal of opponents of the<br />\nnew law should be to inform<br />\nstudents of ths issue. He stressed that students simply do not<br />\nrealize that the law is going to<br />\ndirectly affect them in the up-<br />\n<br />\ncoming year. He is confident<br />\nthat when they do become<br />\naware, there will be much<br />\ngreater support on campus. To<br />\nachieve this end, Schmandt and<br />\nothers in attendance discussed<br />\nsetting up an information table<br />\nin the Gilman Coffee Shop on<br />\nThursday evenings. They plan<br />\nto petition and collect enough<br />\nsignatures to raise consciousness and hopefully stimulate action. Then, after informing<br />\npeople, they hope to hold<br />\nanother meeting.<br />\nSchmandt also warned that<br />\nthere may be moves to expand<br />\nthe law into other areas of<br />\ngovernment funding \"such as<br />\nfood stamps and welfare.\" He<br />\nfeels that people must address<br />\nthe issue now before it grows<br />\nany larger.

Late<br />\nlast fall, the Provost's Office mandated that<br />\nall complaints be directed at the University<br />\naffirmitive action officer, a department<br />\nchairman, or a dean or director of a division. While this policy marks an improvement over no policy at all, it remains insufficient to eliminate the problem of sexual<br />\nharassment at Hopkins.<br />\nPlacing all authority over harassment<br />\ncomplaints in the hands of the administration is a mistake. On the one hand, there<br />\nmay be a tendency for administrators to side<br />\nwith faculty rather than with students when<br />\nconsidering a case. Secondly, graduate<br />\nstudents may be reluctant to bring complaints to those who hold the purse strings<br />\nof their future education. Undergraduates<br />\nmay also be hesitant to risk any reprisal in<br />\nterms of grades. The present University<br />\npolicy thus contains the combined problem<br />\nof potential unfairness and of placing students in a very awkward position.<br />\nA better solution to the problem would be<br />\nto establish a committee comprised of faculty, administration and a high proportion of<br />\nstudents to review cases. It would also be<br />\nprudent for the committee to include someone trained in the legal aspects of harassment<br />\nin order to forestall any lawsuits against the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nTheoretically, once this committee reviewed a case, it would make a recommenda-<br />\n<br />\ntion as to any punitive action to be taken<br />\nagainst a professor. The final decision on<br />\nsuch action must remain in the hands of the<br />\ndeans or department heads. To do otherwise<br />\nwould amount to drastically altering the administrative structure of Johns Hopkins. Yet,<br />\nplacing the ultimate decision in the hands of<br />\nadministrators reverts back to the original<br />\nproblems with the provost's policy. In order<br />\nto ensure that the committee's recommendation is taken seriously, it would be<br />\nnecessary to make all cases open to the<br />\npublic. This is not to say that names of individuals involved should be disclosed, but<br />\nrather that the circumstances of the case, the<br />\ncommittee's actions and the dean's or department head's response should be public<br />\ninformation.<br />\nSexual harassment is a serious problem at<br />\nHopkins. A recent survey of graduate<br />\nstudents revealed that .6 percent of the<br />\nrespondants experienced sexual advances<br />\nfrom professors with threats of reprisals if<br />\nsuch advances were rejected. Surveys of this<br />\ntype, however, often tend to understate the<br />\nextent of the problem. As long as the complaint procedure rests in the hands of partisan administrators, an accurate figure will<br />\nremain unknown as many students will<br />\nchoose to not report incidents. Clearly then,<br />\nthe problem of sexual harassment persists at<br />\nHopkins, and the recent action taken by the<br />\nProvost's office is insufficient to chillinate it.<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nChange The Tenure Process<br />\nBY DOUG F'ELLMAN<br />\nIt is the impression on the<br />\npart of' many students and<br />\nfaculty members that teaching<br />\nplays little, if any, role in promotion and tenure decisions at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Teaching is an<br />\namorphous term, and judging<br />\nthe strengths and weaknesses of<br />\na given instructor is at best a<br />\nsubjective endeavor. But a<br />\ngood many subjective endeavors (like grading) take place at<br />\nJohns Hopkins and if the academic policymakers here want<br />\nto encourage and promote<br />\nteaching as an important part<br />\nof a professor's responsibility,<br />\nthen some formal mechanism<br />\nfor acknowledging teaching in<br />\nits many forms must be incorporated into the current system.<br />\nIt must be noted that what<br />\nfollows is\u2022 offered not as The<br />\nDefinitive Plan, but rather as a<br />\nbasis for thought and discussion. The mechanism I propose<br />\nfor evaluating teaching consists<br />\nof three components, one each<br />\ninvolving current undergraduates, former undergraduates<br />\nand departmental colleagues. It<br />\nmay be that graduate students,<br />\ntoo, can become involved.<br />\nHowever, because of the small<br />\nsize of the departments and the<br />\npeculiar status graduate students occupy therein, it is questionable as to the role they<br />\nshould play.<br />\nOne of the chief concerns<br />\nvoiced by faculty members regarding student evaluation of<br />\ntheir teaching is that, as undergraduates, we are really not<br />\n<br />\nable to judge a professor's<br />\nclassroom presentation for its<br />\nscholarly value. To the extent<br />\nthat given material is relevant<br />\nor on the intellectual frontiers<br />\nof a given academic discipline,<br />\nstudents simply do not possess<br />\nthe background and expertise<br />\nto make such judgements. I<br />\ntend to agree.<br />\nBut in so agreeing I would<br />\nargue that there are certain<br />\nobservations that fall under the<br />\ncategory of \"teaching\" which<br />\nundergraduates are uniquely<br />\nqualified to make. For example, I think a good teacher is accessible, both in and away from<br />\nthe classroom. I would think a<br />\ngood teacher is open to questions and available for the student who may need special help<br />\nor guidance. He or she is<br />\nprepared for class and presents<br />\nan organized and logical lecture<br />\nin a large class or evaluates and<br />\nties together different thoughts<br />\nand opinions in a seminar. Such<br />\na teacher gives more than a cursory reading to essay exams and<br />\nterm papers; indeed, critical<br />\nremarks or insightful comments<br />\ncan be most instructive for a<br />\nstudent. And while the student<br />\nof a good teacher does not have<br />\nto know and understand every<br />\nargument, theory or formula<br />\nthe instructor presents, he<br />\nshould at least be able to<br />\nrecognize discernible patterns<br />\nwithin the course's structure<br />\nand have a general idea of what<br />\nthe professor is trying to say or<br />\nto explain.<br />\nSuch observations on the<br />\npart of undergraduates could<br />\n<br />\nbe gathered for purposes of<br />\ntenure and promotion by a<br />\nquestionnaire sent to a random<br />\nsample of students having<br />\ntaken a course with the professor in question. Such a<br />\nsystem is not without precedent. In fact, a couple of<br />\ndepartments at Johns Hopkins<br />\nalready use similar surveys in<br />\nregard to teaching. The survey<br />\nor questionnaire could be designed to draw out specific<br />\ncomments regarding some of<br />\nthe facets of teaching just mentioned. The results, when tabulated, would provide a decent<br />\npicture of how students view<br />\nthe teaching of a given<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nFormer students can play a<br />\nvery important role in evaluating teaching for tenure and promotion decisions. Such persons<br />\nhave had time to reflect on a<br />\ngiven professor's teaching and<br />\nthe opportunity to apply the<br />\nlessons learned or courses studied to whatever graduate or<br />\nprofessional activity in which<br />\nthey are now engaged. Certainly former students have nothing<br />\nto gain or to lose by responding<br />\nto a questionnaire, and it is likely that their comments will be<br />\nboth insightful and informative.

Opponents of<br />\nregistration failed in their attempts to<br />\nprevent its institution in every available<br />\nlegal means. Instead, they were left only with the option of a form of civil<br />\ndisobedience, namely not signing up. To<br />\nbe brief, the government decided (at<br />\nCongress' suggestion) that rather than<br />\ncontinue prohibitive and seemingly<br />\nfoolish court proceedings, it could act<br />\nto withhold financial aid for those individuals who fail to register.<br />\nIt must be recognized that federal<br />\nfinancial aid for college education is not<br />\nan inherent right. There are a plethora<br />\nof restrictions and assumptions which<br />\nmust be met before one can even qualify<br />\nfor aid. You must be accepted to a<br />\nuniversity in good standing, you must<br />\nbe a full-time student, you must attend<br />\nthe university, you must maintain your<br />\nstanding, you must apply the money<br />\ngiven to your education. If one considers it at any length, it is quickly realized that there is a very narrow norm<br />\nunder which one may qualify for financial aid. The requirement of registration is simply one more item; it is in no<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nway unique.<br />\nBut there is a much broader question<br />\nevaluating teaching.

Along with many<br />\nothers, he is of the opinion that<br />\nthe Rat will survive only if the<br />\ndrinking age is lowered again.<br />\nThe strict enforcement of the<br />\ndrinking laws is one of the major complaints students have<br />\nabout the Rat. Though most<br />\nrealize the necessity of maintaining these standards, they<br />\ndon't feel that the Rat has<br />\nmuch of a chance under such<br />\ncircumstances. One student<br />\nasked, \"Why should I go to a<br />\ndry Rat when 1 can just as well<br />\ndrink somewhere else?\"<br />\nFreshmen, even those who<br />\n\"or<br />\n<br />\nare over the drinking age, don't<br />\npatronize the Rat. One reason<br />\nmay be that the Rat is not \"in\"<br />\nwith underclassmen. Also the<br />\nassociation between the pub<br />\nand the University seems to be<br />\na disadvantage. Eric Smith, a<br />\nfreshman, reasons that \"since<br />\nmost freshmen live on campus<br />\nas well as take classes here, it's<br />\nnice to get off campus for social<br />\nactivities.\" He added that it is<br />\nmuch easier for a freshman to<br />\ndrink in the dorms or at a frat,<br />\nso that most don't feel like<br />\nhassling with the rules imposed<br />\nat the Rat.<br />\nMusical taste is another factor.

Across the road, sitting in the<br />\nshade, are those who want to get on. They quickly run<br />\ntoward the bus, forming a crowd near the door. Shouts<br />\nof \"I hope I don't get lost at the Harbor,\" and \"I<br />\ncan't wait to get something normal to eat\" are<br />\nheard.

In front of them are<br />\nknobs which adjust the amount of light shining upon<br />\nthe mirrors. There's a trick, though.

There's a little guy<br />\nclapping his hands at the accessible end. He hears an<br />\necho because the noise of hands striking is composed<br />\nof many frequencies.

Even with the growing popularity of Harbor Place, some treat the Maryland Science Center as<br />\na stranger.

There<br />\nare metal frame doors, but they are usually closed, so<br />\nthe revolving ones are the only option.

The implant contains<br />\ntestosterone and estadiol, both<br />\nof which are continually released in males. Once the hormones<br />\nare being released at the same<br />\nrate at which the testes emit<br />\nthem, the brain instructs the<br />\ntestes to cease making these<br />\nhormones. This causes the<br />\ntestes to stop making sperm.<br />\nFor some time, the Upjohn<br />\nCompany funded the research,<br />\nbut dropped their male contraceptive program when it was<br />\ndiscovered that steroids used in<br />\nthe birth control pill cause<br />\nserious side effects. No other<br />\npharmaceutical company has<br />\never expressed any interest in<br />\nthe research.<br />\nThe initial studies used rabbits, rats and monkeys. It was<br />\nfound that once the implant<br />\nwas removed, fertility returned,<br />\nand absolutely no births occurred while the implant was present. The only known side effects are abnormal hair growth<br />\nover the area where the implant<br />\nis placed and shrinkage of the<br />\ntesticles because they are pro-<br />\n<br />\nducing less sperm.<br />\nBut for the Food and Drug<br />\nAdministration to allow Ewing<br />\nto experiment with humans,<br />\nthere must be evidence that<br />\nmales will produce no sperm,<br />\nsomething Ewing says is \"very<br />\ndifficult to achieve.\" Ewing has<br />\nsucceeded in reducing sperm<br />\nappreciably, with the remaining<br />\nsperm cells being immotile. The<br />\ngovernment is concerned that<br />\nimplants will cause abnormal<br />\nsperm cells to be made, which<br />\nmay fertilize a female egg,<br />\ncausing congenital, abnormal<br />\noffspring. Ewing argues that<br />\nnormal human semen already<br />\nconsists of about 40 percent abnormal sperm.<br />\nEwing admits that the implant is still in an early stage of<br />\ndevelopment, but it has been<br />\npatented as a male contraceptive. The hormones the implant<br />\nreleases, testosterone and estadiol, are normal, naturally occurring hormones. The hormones are released in low doses, approximately the amount<br />\nnormally produced by the<br />\ntestes.<br />\nDoctors at the Johns Hopkins Medical School have developed a method of vasectomy<br />\nthat does not involve surgery.<br />\nDr. Donald Coffey of the Urology Department wanted a<br />\nrapid, non-surgical procedure,<br />\nespecially to be implemented in<br />\nunder-developed countries,<br />\nwhere surgical vasectomy is<br />\nconfused with castration. Cof-<br />\n<br />\nfey and Dr. Coy Freeman injected the vas with a chemical<br />\nthat would \"cold-cook\" the vas<br />\nand cause coagulation. One injection, 50 milliliters of the<br />\nchemical, caused sclerosing.<br />\nThis method was successful on<br />\nrats and dogs.<br />\nDr. Joseph Davis of the New<br />\nYork Medical College had success with 11 of 12 people who<br />\nunderwent the treatment. Dr.<br />\nCoffey has not pursued the<br />\nresearch further.<br />\nWhen on sabbatical six years<br />\nago, Dr. Richard Cone of the<br />\nBiophysics Department at<br />\nHomewood worked for Dr.<br />\nEwing. Until that time, Cone<br />\nhad studied code receptors. He<br />\nwanted to do more pertinent<br />\nresearch, something with a<br />\nmore immediate effect. Citing<br />\ngenetic engineering and<br />\npsychopharmacology, Cone<br />\nsaid that at the time he was<br />\n\"bothered with what science<br />\nand technology are doing these<br />\ndays. . .difficult to control, adjust.\" He picked a field with<br />\nfewer problems, choosing contraception. But he didn't<br />\nchoose it because of overpopulation. Cone says contraceptives \"should have fewer side<br />\neffects\" and should be \"less of<br />\na bother to use.\" Foams,<br />\ncreams, jellies and suppositories have their advantages, but<br />\nthey irritate because they kill all<br />\ncells, not just sperm. Cone<br />\nwishes to \"develop a better<br />\ntopical spermacide.\" If the<br />\n<br />\nSPRING FAIR<br />\n<br />\nspermacide was specific just for<br />\nsperm, then smaller amounts<br />\ncould be used. Also, the spermacide should be specific for<br />\nsexually transmitted diseases.<br />\nAccording to Cone,\"by developing more powerful, more<br />\nsperm-specific spermacides, it<br />\nwould be possible to make a<br />\nmuch better cream or jelly<br />\nwhere the reliability would be<br />\nhigh.\"<br />\nAll of Cone's research has<br />\nbeen basic. He has studied the<br />\nmechanism which initiates<br />\nsperm motility. He wishes to<br />\n<br />\ndiscover this mechanism and<br />\n\"switch it off.\" What was<br />\ndiscovered was that mucus is<br />\nthick enough to stop sperm<br />\nfrom moving. The sperm could<br />\nbe immobilized mechanically,<br />\nand the mucus also protects<br />\nsperm from the intestinal<br />\nbacteria E. coli. Dr. Cone has<br />\nbeen awarded a grant to study<br />\nthe effect of mucus on sperm<br />\nmotility. For now, Cone says,<br />\n\"if you really want good contraception and prophylaxis, use<br />\na condom and a form of<br />\nsuppository.\"<br />\n<br />\nNational Condom Week<br />\nThe Peer Sex Educators and<br />\nthe Student Health Advisory<br />\nCommittee will be sponsoring a<br />\nseries of activities during the<br />\nweek of February 14.

Three<br />\nfaculty members have been fired under<br />\nsuspicion of being \"reds.\" Michael, a<br />\n\"liberal\" student, expresses his outrage<br />\nin an editorial in the school literary<br />\nmagazine. The letter praises English<br />\nteacher Tom Turner for promising to<br />\nread the pre-electric chair letter of<br />\nVanzetti, the infamous Anarchist. If<br />\nTom reads the letter, the Board of<br />\nTrustees, who are in town for the big<br />\ngame, will have him fired. The play<br />\ndeclares to us how unfair this is, since<br />\nafter all Tom is not really a Bolshevik,<br />\nta,<br />\n<br />\nto almost anyohe.

Frank Messer of the New<br />\nYork Yankees' crew and Steve Albert,<br />\nan alumnus of the New York Mets television booth, are two of the worst chatterers. Joe Garagiola of NBC knows<br />\nwhen to turn the talk off, as he showed<br />\nin the last inning of Nolan Ryan's most<br />\nrecent no-hitter on national television.<br />\nThe team of Garagiola and Tony Kubek<br />\nmentioned only the count on each batter after each pitch. If they had started<br />\njabbering they would only have detracted frorri the excitement of that no-hitter.<br />\nCosell would not have had the will<br />\npower to shut up.<br />\nToo much talking can detract from a<br />\ngame because of the superfluous information and constant dialogue. Another<br />\nbrand of distracting baseball announcing is straying from the game, something<br />\nfor which Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees<br />\nis famous. He will disrupt the continuity of a game by wishing a happy birthday to a sickly kid, he says hello to old<br />\nfriends, and even tells old stories that are<br />\nso complicated they run from inning to<br />\ninning. Chuck Thompson of our hometown Orioles frequently strays from the<br />\naction, but usually to tell us about the<br />\nfresh, clean taste of a certain brand of<br />\nbeer.<br />\nThere is a fine line between too much<br />\nyakking and simple hyperactivity, but it<br />\nis usually a clear division. Hyperactivity is characterized by swearing, violent<br />\nreactions to umpire calls, or just yelling.<br />\nPhil Rizzuto is both talkative and<br />\nhyperactive. His famous \"Holy cow\"<br />\nand \"What a huckleberry\" are his ways<br />\nof swearing. Bob Murphy and Lindsay<br />\nNelson, two all-time favorites of Met<br />\n<br />\ntelevision fans, are both hyperactive announcers. Nelson, who ended his Met<br />\nannouncing tenure a few years ago,<br />\noften became tongue-tied when the action was happening faster than his<br />\nmouth could work. Murphy never spoke<br />\nrapidly. Instead, he would condense the<br />\naction and recite an easily remembered<br />\nand always descriptive phrase instead of<br />\nexplaining what had been captured by<br />\nthe television cameras. A John Stearns<br />\nbelly-slide into second base to break up<br />\na double play was described by Murphy<br />\nthis way: \"It was clean. It was hard. It<br />\nwas aggressive.\"<br />\nAt the other end of the activity scale<br />\nfrom Phil Rizzuto are what we call the<br />\ndeadpan announcers. They are usually<br />\nformer veteran baseball players who<br />\nhave seen everything. Nothing the Mets<br />\ndo surprises Ralph Kiner and nothing<br />\nthe Orioles do surprises Brooks Robinson. They call the action or supply the<br />\ncolor commentary in a matter-of-fact,<br />\ncalm manner. A home run is a home<br />\nrun. A diving catch is just that. These<br />\nexperienced ex-ballplayers simply supply<br />\nthe necessary, and sometimes not even<br />\nthat. Several pitches or a base hit can go<br />\nby without comment when these men<br />\nare in charge of telling us what happens.<br />\nThey rarely get excited, but when they<br />\ndo it is always warranted.<br />\nEvery television baseball announcer<br />\ndoes his job with a certain style, and it<br />\nis the characteristics that comprise his<br />\nstyle that we enjoy, tolerate or turn off,<br />\ndepending on the merits of those peculiarities.

Under the new law,<br />\nonly those people who turned<br /><br />\n18 before last July 1 are eligible to buy beer and wine.<br />\nAware that this law would<br />\nforce changes in the fair's beer<br />\npolicy, Assistant Dean of<br />\nStudents Chris Columbo formed an ad-hoc committee to deal<br />\nwith this and other fair policies.<br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nMary Ellen Porter chaired this<br />\ncommittee, which decided the<br />\nnew policy.

The<br />\nAlumni Network, which is<br />\ndesigned as an information service rather than a 'job network,\" presently has about 50<br />\nlistings. The service is to<br />\nbecome a permanent part of the<br />\noffice's operations, which include sponsoring visits from<br />\nrecruiting businesses and graduate schools; resume and interview technique workshops; listings of part-time, full-time and<br />\nsummer jobs; individual consultations for resume writing<br />\nand career objectives; basic information services and handling the credentials for teaching<br />\npositions.<br />\nThe Alumni Network was initiated last December when the<br />\nAlumni Relations Office, in<br />\nconjunction with the Placement<br />\nOffice, placed an advertisement<br />\nin Johns Hopkins magazine entreating graduates to send in<br />\nbrief biographies including<br />\neducation and employment information. These forms are<br />\npresently filed alphabetically in<br />\nthe Placement.Office.<br />\nThe cards are designed to be<br />\nused by students to obtain information and advice from<br />\nalumni who have experience in<br />\na given career, or .are with a<br />\ngraduate institution. For instance, there is a card from a<br />\n1963 social science graduate<br />\nwho had 14 years of experience<br />\nas a resident and businessman<br />\nin Europe. Another card was<br />\nsent in by a Hopkins undergraduate who is presently<br />\nemployed as a producer of<br />\nprivate video programming for<br />\nthe corporate sector.<br /><br />\nThe office also handles visits<br />\nfrom corporations who actively recruit students for employment. Most of these companies<br />\nare in the fields of engineering,<br />\nbanking, insurance or management. Baughan notes that the<br />\nnumber of visits is increasing.<br />\nDuring the 1977-78 academic<br />\nyear, there were 60 company<br />\nvisits; last year there were 115.<br />\nThe increase is partly due to<br />\na nationwide increase in recruiting and partly due to<br />\nBaughan's own initiative. Over<br />\nthe last several years, she has<br />\ncontacted a number of the corporations that students are<br />\nmost interested in.

She feels that this individual attention is somewhat<br />\nunique. It is important because<br />\nstudents learn to write resumes<br />\ncorrectly, as well as getting tips<br />\non cover letters and interview<br />\ntechniques. This is information<br />\nthat they can use throughout<br />\ntheir lives whenever they apply<br />\nfor a new job.<br />\nMany schools send out books<br />\nof students' resumes to prospective employers.

Sponh\\ Rep. &gt;olonihm R<br />\nso!<br />\nNY), the law, which takes etfeet on May 1, requires all<br />\nfinancial aid recipients to provide their draft papers before<br />\nthey can be considered eligible.<br />\nAttendance at the meeting<br />\nwas slim, but this was attributed to poor advertising rather<br />\nthan lack of interest. \"The majority of Hopkins students receive some kind of financial<br />\naid, so it is inconceivable that<br />\nthey are not concerned about<br />\nthis issue,\" said Phillip<br />\nSchmandt, one of those in<br />\nattendance.<br />\nAt this time there is no<br />\norganized group on campus<br />\nwhich formally protests the<br />\nlaw, but several students receive<br />\ncorrespondence from national<br />\norganizations like CARD(Committee Against Registration and<br />\nDraft) and the U.S. Student<br />\nAssociation. Schmandt also<br />\nsaid that he and others have<br />\nbeen in contact with Hopkins<br />\nFinancial Aid Director Susan<br />\nBroadbent, and that she is<br />\n\"supportive\" of the cause here<br />\non campus. Schmandt added<br />\nthat at Yale University,<br />\nadministrators have said that<br />\nthe university will replace any<br />\nfinancial assistance that the<br />\ngovernment takes away from<br /><br />\nat anti-draft registration meeting.<br />\nPhil Schmandt (right) leads discussion<br /><br />\nstudents as a result of the new<br />\nlaw. Schmandt feels that this is<br />\n\"definitely a positive step,\" but<br />\nnoted that such a move here at<br />\nHopkins is \"highly unlikely.\"<br />\nSchmandt c;.els that although<br />\nadministrators here would not<br />\nmake such a move, they have<br />\nreason to be against the law<br />\nanyway. According to Schmandt,<br />\nthe new law would lead to<br />\nmuch confusion and increased<br />\npaperwork. Students would be<br />\nrequired to submit a draft<br />\npaper which, he feels, many<br />\npeople have \"lost or thrown<br />\naway.\" In addition, some confusion might occur as a result<br />\nof students' not realizing just<br />\nwhat the law means.<br />\nAccording to Schmandt, the<br />\nmajor goal of opponents of the<br />\nnew law should be to inform<br />\nstudents of ths issue.

Late<br />\nlast fall, the Provost's Office mandated that<br />\nall complaints be directed at the University<br />\naffirmitive action officer, a department<br />\nchairman, or a dean or director of a division. While this policy marks an improvement over no policy at all, it remains insufficient to eliminate the problem of sexual<br />\nharassment at Hopkins.<br />\nPlacing all authority over harassment<br />\ncomplaints in the hands of the administration is a mistake. On the one hand, there<br />\nmay be a tendency for administrators to side<br />\nwith faculty rather than with students when<br />\nconsidering a case. Secondly, graduate<br />\nstudents may be reluctant to bring complaints to those who hold the purse strings<br />\nof their future education. Undergraduates<br />\nmay also be hesitant to risk any reprisal in<br />\nterms of grades. The present University<br />\npolicy thus contains the combined problem<br />\nof potential unfairness and of placing students in a very awkward position.<br />\nA better solution to the problem would be<br />\nto establish a committee comprised of faculty, administration and a high proportion of<br />\nstudents to review cases. It would also be<br />\nprudent for the committee to include someone trained in the legal aspects of harassment<br />\nin order to forestall any lawsuits against the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\nTheoretically, once this committee reviewed a case, it would make a recommenda-<br /><br />\ntion as to any punitive action to be taken<br />\nagainst a professor. The final decision on<br />\nsuch action must remain in the hands of the<br />\ndeans or department heads. To do otherwise<br />\nwould amount to drastically altering the administrative structure of Johns Hopkins. Yet,<br />\nplacing the ultimate decision in the hands of<br />\nadministrators reverts back to the original<br />\nproblems with the provost's policy. In order<br />\nto ensure that the committee's recommendation is taken seriously, it would be<br />\nnecessary to make all cases open to the<br />\npublic. This is not to say that names of individuals involved should be disclosed, but<br />\nrather that the circumstances of the case, the<br />\ncommittee's actions and the dean's or department head's response should be public<br />\ninformation.<br />\nSexual harassment is a serious problem at<br />\nHopkins. A recent survey of graduate<br />\nstudents revealed that .6 percent of the<br />\nrespondants experienced sexual advances<br />\nfrom professors with threats of reprisals if<br />\nsuch advances were rejected. Surveys of this<br />\ntype, however, often tend to understate the<br />\nextent of the problem. As long as the complaint procedure rests in the hands of partisan administrators, an accurate figure will<br />\nremain unknown as many students will<br />\nchoose to not report incidents. Clearly then,<br />\nthe problem of sexual harassment persists at<br />\nHopkins, and the recent action taken by the<br />\nProvost's office is insufficient to chillinate it.<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nChange The Tenure Process<br />\nBY DOUG F'ELLMAN<br />\nIt is the impression on the<br />\npart of' many students and<br />\nfaculty members that teaching<br />\nplays little, if any, role in promotion and tenure decisions at<br />\nJohns Hopkins. Teaching is an<br />\namorphous term, and judging<br />\nthe strengths and weaknesses of<br />\na given instructor is at best a<br />\nsubjective endeavor. But a<br />\ngood many subjective endeavors (like grading) take place at<br />\nJohns Hopkins and if the academic policymakers here want<br />\nto encourage and promote<br />\nteaching as an important part<br />\nof a professor's responsibility,<br />\nthen some formal mechanism<br />\nfor acknowledging teaching in<br />\nits many forms must be incorporated into the current system.<br />\nIt must be noted that what<br />\nfollows is\u2022 offered not as The<br />\nDefinitive Plan, but rather as a<br />\nbasis for thought and discussion. The mechanism I propose<br />\nfor evaluating teaching consists<br />\nof three components, one each<br />\ninvolving current undergraduates, former undergraduates<br />\nand departmental colleagues. It<br />\nmay be that graduate students,<br />\ntoo, can become involved.<br />\nHowever, because of the small<br />\nsize of the departments and the<br />\npeculiar status graduate students occupy therein, it is questionable as to the role they<br />\nshould play.<br />\nOne of the chief concerns<br />\nvoiced by faculty members regarding student evaluation of<br />\ntheir teaching is that, as undergraduates, we are really not<br /><br />\nable to judge a professor's<br />\nclassroom presentation for its<br />\nscholarly value. To the extent<br />\nthat given material is relevant<br />\nor on the intellectual frontiers<br />\nof a given academic discipline,<br />\nstudents simply do not possess<br />\nthe background and expertise<br />\nto make such judgements. I<br />\ntend to agree.<br />\nBut in so agreeing I would<br />\nargue that there are certain<br />\nobservations that fall under the<br />\ncategory of \"teaching\" which<br />\nundergraduates are uniquely<br />\nqualified to make. For example, I think a good teacher is accessible, both in and away from<br />\nthe classroom. I would think a<br />\ngood teacher is open to questions and available for the student who may need special help<br />\nor guidance. He or she is<br />\nprepared for class and presents<br />\nan organized and logical lecture<br />\nin a large class or evaluates and<br />\nties together different thoughts<br />\nand opinions in a seminar. Such<br />\na teacher gives more than a cursory reading to essay exams and<br />\nterm papers; indeed, critical<br />\nremarks or insightful comments<br />\ncan be most instructive for a<br />\nstudent. And while the student<br />\nof a good teacher does not have<br />\nto know and understand every<br />\nargument, theory or formula<br />\nthe instructor presents, he<br />\nshould at least be able to<br />\nrecognize discernible patterns<br />\nwithin the course's structure<br />\nand have a general idea of what<br />\nthe professor is trying to say or<br />\nto explain.<br />\nSuch observations on the<br />\npart of undergraduates could<br /><br />\nbe gathered for purposes of<br />\ntenure and promotion by a<br />\nquestionnaire sent to a random<br />\nsample of students having<br />\ntaken a course with the professor in question. Such a<br />\nsystem is not without precedent. In fact, a couple of<br />\ndepartments at Johns Hopkins<br />\nalready use similar surveys in<br />\nregard to teaching. The survey<br />\nor questionnaire could be designed to draw out specific<br />\ncomments regarding some of<br />\nthe facets of teaching just mentioned. The results, when tabulated, would provide a decent<br />\npicture of how students view<br />\nthe teaching of a given<br />\nprofessor.<br />\nFormer students can play a<br />\nvery important role in evaluating teaching for tenure and promotion decisions. Such persons<br />\nhave had time to reflect on a<br />\ngiven professor's teaching and<br />\nthe opportunity to apply the<br />\nlessons learned or courses studied to whatever graduate or<br />\nprofessional activity in which<br />\nthey are now engaged. Certainly former students have nothing<br />\nto gain or to lose by responding<br />\nto a questionnaire, and it is likely that their comments will be<br />\nboth insightful and informative. Again there is precedent.<br />\nDartmouth College asks for<br />\n30-40 letters from alumni<br />\ntaught by a candidate for<br />\ntenure over the past three or<br />\nfour years.<br />\nA professor's colleagues<br />\nwithin a given department<br />\ncan also play a role in<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nAll Sides Of TA Problem Must Be Exposed<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe growing concern over<br />\nthe oral competency of TAs is<br />\na real and urgent issue.

Opponents of<br />\nregistration failed in their attempts to<br />\nprevent its institution in every available<br />\nlegal means. Instead, they were left only with the option of a form of civil<br />\ndisobedience, namely not signing up. To<br />\nbe brief, the government decided (at<br />\nCongress' suggestion) that rather than<br />\ncontinue prohibitive and seemingly<br />\nfoolish court proceedings, it could act<br />\nto withhold financial aid for those individuals who fail to register.<br />\nIt must be recognized that federal<br />\nfinancial aid for college education is not<br />\nan inherent right. There are a plethora<br />\nof restrictions and assumptions which<br />\nmust be met before one can even qualify<br />\nfor aid. You must be accepted to a<br />\nuniversity in good standing, you must<br />\nbe a full-time student, you must attend<br />\nthe university, you must maintain your<br />\nstanding, you must apply the money<br />\ngiven to your education. If one considers it at any length, it is quickly realized that there is a very narrow norm<br />\nunder which one may qualify for financial aid. The requirement of registration is simply one more item; it is in no<br />\ncont. from p. 4<br />\nway unique.<br />\nBut there is a much broader question<br />\nevaluating teaching.

After all, such as the constitutionality of interthis one is quite limited in scope. It governmental sharing of information,<br />\nwould not affect anyone not in college, the conscription itself, and its all-male<br />\ncomponent. Also at issue is the constitutionality of the requirement that all of<br />\nthe needy students must register for the<br />\ndraft before they are allowed a judicial<br />\nhearing so they can receive their financial aid. This is regardless of their<br />\nphysical condition and their moral and<br />\nreligious beliefs. Many students would<br />\nbe forced to register for the draft<br />\nbecause of the financial aid clause, even<br />\nthough they should be exempted from<br />\nserving in the military. These are some<br />\nof the broader questions that are being<br />\ndebated elsewhere. They cannot be discussed adequately here. The basic issue<br />\nof fairness was to be uncovered here.<br />\nThis fairness is not based upon constitutional grounds, but on personal ones. Is<br />\nit fair for our government to single out<br />\none select group and threaten to curtail<br />\na vital privilege that is in no way connected to the controversial rule to be enforced? This plan is designed to harass<br />\na specific group of less than wealthy college students.

One student<br />\nasked, \"Why should I go to a<br />\ndry Rat when 1 can just as well<br />\ndrink somewhere else?\"<br />\nFreshmen, even those who<br />\n\"or<br /><br />\nare over the drinking age, don't<br />\npatronize the Rat. One reason<br />\nmay be that the Rat is not \"in\"<br />\nwith underclassmen. Also the<br />\nassociation between the pub<br />\nand the University seems to be<br />\na disadvantage. Eric Smith, a<br />\nfreshman, reasons that \"since<br />\nmost freshmen live on campus<br />\nas well as take classes here, it's<br />\nnice to get off campus for social<br />\nactivities.\" He added that it is<br />\nmuch easier for a freshman to<br />\ndrink in the dorms or at a frat,<br />\nso that most don't feel like<br />\nhassling with the rules imposed<br />\nat the Rat.<br />\nMusical taste is another factor.

The implant contains<br />\ntestosterone and estadiol, both<br />\nof which are continually released in males. Once the hormones<br />\nare being released at the same<br />\nrate at which the testes emit<br />\nthem, the brain instructs the<br />\ntestes to cease making these<br />\nhormones. This causes the<br />\ntestes to stop making sperm.<br />\nFor some time, the Upjohn<br />\nCompany funded the research,<br />\nbut dropped their male contraceptive program when it was<br />\ndiscovered that steroids used in<br />\nthe birth control pill cause<br />\nserious side effects. No other<br />\npharmaceutical company has<br />\never expressed any interest in<br />\nthe research.<br />\nThe initial studies used rabbits, rats and monkeys. It was<br />\nfound that once the implant<br />\nwas removed, fertility returned,<br />\nand absolutely no births occurred while the implant was present. The only known side effects are abnormal hair growth<br />\nover the area where the implant<br />\nis placed and shrinkage of the<br />\ntesticles because they are pro-<br /><br />\nducing less sperm.<br />\nBut for the Food and Drug<br />\nAdministration to allow Ewing<br />\nto experiment with humans,<br />\nthere must be evidence that<br />\nmales will produce no sperm,<br />\nsomething Ewing says is \"very<br />\ndifficult to achieve.\" Ewing has<br />\nsucceeded in reducing sperm<br />\nappreciably, with the remaining<br />\nsperm cells being immotile. The<br />\ngovernment is concerned that<br />\nimplants will cause abnormal<br />\nsperm cells to be made, which<br />\nmay fertilize a female egg,<br />\ncausing congenital, abnormal<br />\noffspring. Ewing argues that<br />\nnormal human semen already<br />\nconsists of about 40 percent abnormal sperm.<br />\nEwing admits that the implant is still in an early stage of<br />\ndevelopment, but it has been<br />\npatented as a male contraceptive. The hormones the implant<br />\nreleases, testosterone and estadiol, are normal, naturally occurring hormones. The hormones are released in low doses, approximately the amount<br />\nnormally produced by the<br />\ntestes.<br />\nDoctors at the Johns Hopkins Medical School have developed a method of vasectomy<br />\nthat does not involve surgery.<br />\nDr. Donald Coffey of the Urology Department wanted a<br />\nrapid, non-surgical procedure,<br />\nespecially to be implemented in<br />\nunder-developed countries,<br />\nwhere surgical vasectomy is<br />\nconfused with castration. Cof-<br /><br />\nfey and Dr. Coy Freeman injected the vas with a chemical<br />\nthat would \"cold-cook\" the vas<br />\nand cause coagulation. One injection, 50 milliliters of the<br />\nchemical, caused sclerosing.<br />\nThis method was successful on<br />\nrats and dogs.<br />\nDr. Joseph Davis of the New<br />\nYork Medical College had success with 11 of 12 people who<br />\nunderwent the treatment. Dr.<br />\nCoffey has not pursued the<br />\nresearch further.<br />\nWhen on sabbatical six years<br />\nago, Dr. Richard Cone of the<br />\nBiophysics Department at<br />\nHomewood worked for Dr.<br />\nEwing. Until that time, Cone<br />\nhad studied code receptors. He<br />\nwanted to do more pertinent<br />\nresearch, something with a<br />\nmore immediate effect. Citing<br />\ngenetic engineering and<br />\npsychopharmacology, Cone<br />\nsaid that at the time he was<br />\n\"bothered with what science<br />\nand technology are doing these<br />\ndays. . .difficult to control, adjust.\" He picked a field with<br />\nfewer problems, choosing contraception. But he didn't<br />\nchoose it because of overpopulation. Cone says contraceptives \"should have fewer side<br />\neffects\" and should be \"less of<br />\na bother to use.\" Foams,<br />\ncreams, jellies and suppositories have their advantages, but<br />\nthey irritate because they kill all<br />\ncells, not just sperm. Cone<br />\nwishes to \"develop a better<br />\ntopical spermacide.\" If the<br /><br />\nSPRING FAIR<br /><br />\nspermacide was specific just for<br />\nsperm, then smaller amounts<br />\ncould be used. Also, the spermacide should be specific for<br />\nsexually transmitted diseases.<br />\nAccording to Cone,\"by developing more powerful, more<br />\nsperm-specific spermacides, it<br />\nwould be possible to make a<br />\nmuch better cream or jelly<br />\nwhere the reliability would be<br />\nhigh.\"<br />\nAll of Cone's research has<br />\nbeen basic. He has studied the<br />\nmechanism which initiates<br />\nsperm motility. He wishes to<br /><br />\ndiscover this mechanism and<br />\n\"switch it off.\" What was<br />\ndiscovered was that mucus is<br />\nthick enough to stop sperm<br />\nfrom moving. The sperm could<br />\nbe immobilized mechanically,<br />\nand the mucus also protects<br />\nsperm from the intestinal<br />\nbacteria E. coli. Dr. Cone has<br />\nbeen awarded a grant to study<br />\nthe effect of mucus on sperm<br />\nmotility. For now, Cone says,<br />\n\"if you really want good contraception and prophylaxis, use<br />\na condom and a form of<br />\nsuppository.\"<br /><br />\nNational Condom Week<br />\nThe Peer Sex Educators and<br />\nthe Student Health Advisory<br />\nCommittee will be sponsoring a<br />\nseries of activities during the<br />\nweek of February 14.

Three<br />\nfaculty members have been fired under<br />\nsuspicion of being \"reds.\" Michael, a<br />\n\"liberal\" student, expresses his outrage<br />\nin an editorial in the school literary<br />\nmagazine. The letter praises English<br />\nteacher Tom Turner for promising to<br />\nread the pre-electric chair letter of<br />\nVanzetti, the infamous Anarchist. If<br />\nTom reads the letter, the Board of<br />\nTrustees, who are in town for the big<br />\ngame, will have him fired. The play<br />\ndeclares to us how unfair this is, since<br />\nafter all Tom is not really a Bolshevik,<br />\nta,<br /><br />\nto almost anyohe.

Frank Messer of the New<br />\nYork Yankees' crew and Steve Albert,<br />\nan alumnus of the New York Mets television booth, are two of the worst chatterers. Joe Garagiola of NBC knows<br />\nwhen to turn the talk off, as he showed<br />\nin the last inning of Nolan Ryan's most<br />\nrecent no-hitter on national television.<br />\nThe team of Garagiola and Tony Kubek<br />\nmentioned only the count on each batter after each pitch. If they had started<br />\njabbering they would only have detracted frorri the excitement of that no-hitter.<br />\nCosell would not have had the will<br />\npower to shut up.<br />\nToo much talking can detract from a<br />\ngame because of the superfluous information and constant dialogue. Another<br />\nbrand of distracting baseball announcing is straying from the game, something<br />\nfor which Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees<br />\nis famous. He will disrupt the continuity of a game by wishing a happy birthday to a sickly kid, he says hello to old<br />\nfriends, and even tells old stories that are<br />\nso complicated they run from inning to<br />\ninning. Chuck Thompson of our hometown Orioles frequently strays from the<br />\naction, but usually to tell us about the<br />\nfresh, clean taste of a certain brand of<br />\nbeer.<br />\nThere is a fine line between too much<br />\nyakking and simple hyperactivity, but it<br />\nis usually a clear division. Hyperactivity is characterized by swearing, violent<br />\nreactions to umpire calls, or just yelling.<br />\nPhil Rizzuto is both talkative and<br />\nhyperactive. His famous \"Holy cow\"<br />\nand \"What a huckleberry\" are his ways<br />\nof swearing. Bob Murphy and Lindsay<br />\nNelson, two all-time favorites of Met<br /><br />\ntelevision fans, are both hyperactive announcers. Nelson, who ended his Met<br />\nannouncing tenure a few years ago,<br />\noften became tongue-tied when the action was happening faster than his<br />\nmouth could work. Murphy never spoke<br />\nrapidly. Instead, he would condense the<br />\naction and recite an easily remembered<br />\nand always descriptive phrase instead of<br />\nexplaining what had been captured by<br />\nthe television cameras. A John Stearns<br />\nbelly-slide into second base to break up<br />\na double play was described by Murphy<br />\nthis way: \"It was clean. It was hard. It<br />\nwas aggressive.\"<br />\nAt the other end of the activity scale<br />\nfrom Phil Rizzuto are what we call the<br />\ndeadpan announcers. They are usually<br />\nformer veteran baseball players who<br />\nhave seen everything. Nothing the Mets<br />\ndo surprises Ralph Kiner and nothing<br />\nthe Orioles do surprises Brooks Robinson. They call the action or supply the<br />\ncolor commentary in a matter-of-fact,<br />\ncalm manner. A home run is a home<br />\nrun. A diving catch is just that. These<br />\nexperienced ex-ballplayers simply supply<br />\nthe necessary, and sometimes not even<br />\nthat. Several pitches or a base hit can go<br />\nby without comment when these men<br />\nare in charge of telling us what happens.<br />\nThey rarely get excited, but when they<br />\ndo it is always warranted.<br />\nEvery television baseball announcer<br />\ndoes his job with a certain style, and it<br />\nis the characteristics that comprise his<br />\nstyle that we enjoy, tolerate or turn off,<br />\ndepending on the merits of those peculiarities.
