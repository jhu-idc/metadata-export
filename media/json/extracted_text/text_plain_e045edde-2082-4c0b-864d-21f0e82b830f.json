Sir William<br />\nwas presented for the degree by<br />\nDean Griffin, secretary of the Academic Council, but contrary to custom, the speech of presentation was<br />\nmade by President Remsen himself.<br />\nThe President referred to his first<br />\nmeeting with the illustrious British<br />\nscientist. In 1871 a young Scotchman came to the front door of the<br />\nchemical laboratory. at the University of Tubingen, and knocked. The<br />\nfront door was not in general use,<br />\nentrance and egress being had by<br />\nthe back one, but of this the young<br />\nstranger was ignorant. At length<br />\nPresident Remsen, then an assistant<br />\nin the laboratory, had his attention<br />\nattracted by the knocking, and with<br />\nhis face and hands grimy from.the<br />\ncoal with which he was working,<br />\nwent to the door and opened it,<br />\ncoming face to face for the first<br />\ntime with William Ramsay.<br />\nThe President then spoke briefly<br />\nof the achievements which since<br />\nthat first meeting have brought the<br />\n'Young Scotchman fame and honors.<br />\nIn the early nineties Lord Ramsay,<br />\n\u2022in his experiments to determine the<br />\nweight of nitrogen, discovered that<br />\nthe nitrogen of the air was slightly<br />\nheavier than that obtained from<br />\nother sources. This Ramsay showed<br />\nto be due to the presence of an<br />\ninert gas, which he called Argon;<br />\nand by this demonstration he first<br />\ncame into world-wide prominence.<br />\nHe has since discovered three other<br />\nrare inert gases in the atmosphere.<br />\nAfter what President Remsen _facetiously called \"the radio-active period of chemistry\" set in, Sir William was the first to call attention<br />\nto the fact that radium is constantly<br />\ndisintegrating by sending out substances into the atmosphere; and<br />\none of these substances, known as<br />\nHelium, he was the earliest to discover existing upon the earth.<br />\nThese discoveries have a deep bearing upon the old problem of the<br />\ntransmutation of elements; and the<br />\nPresident reminded his audience<br />\nthat Sir William is at present engaged upon much the same problem as that which exercised the ingenuity of the alchemists.<br />\nAfter receiving the degree, Sir<br />\nWilliam made a brief speech of<br />\nthanks, mentioning his kindly recollection of the long essays which<br />\nPresident Remsen used to make<br />\nhim write at Tubingen, and expressing his gratification at being<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\n1912.<br />\n<br />\nRHODES EXAMINATIONS HELD<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS LOSES HARD GAME<br />\n<br />\nHopkins and St. John's Men Try for<br />\nScholarship Getz, Brown, Niles and<br />\nMarshall Candidates.<br />\n<br />\nFranklin and Mar:hall Victorious, But<br />\nBlack and Blue Makes a Very Creditable Showing\u2014Two Field Goals.<br />\n<br />\nThe examinations for the Rhodes<br />\nScholarship from Maryland were<br />\nheld in McCoy Hall last Tuesday<br />\nand Wednesday.

The<br />\nrules have already been disregarded<br />\nin the election of Getz as manager<br />\nof the baseball team and Carter<br />\nof the lacrosse team. These men are<br />\nboth connected with the press in<br />\nviolation of the rule which provides<br />\nthat no undergraduate manager<br />\nshall have any connection with a<br />\ncity paper.

The game<br />\nwas hard fought and a pretty one<br />\nto watch. The Black and Blue<br />\neleven played true to form most of<br />\nthe time, and forced the visitors to<br />\nextend themselves to their utmost.<br />\nFailure to block a long forward<br />\npass in the fourth quarter cost<br />\nlopkins the game. A well thrown<br />\npass from Jones to Sykes netted 20<br />\nyards for Franklin and Marshall,<br />\nand placed the pigskin on Hopkins'<br />\neight-yard line. From this point<br />\nthe Franklin and Mar-shall team<br />\ncarried the ball across the line on<br />\nthe third attempt. Hopkins made<br />\na desperate stand in front of the<br />\ngoal line, but the weight of the opposing team was too much for the<br />\nBlack and Blue. Wood scored the<br />\ntouchdown and kicked goal.<br />\nGillett kicked a pretty field goal<br />\nfrom the 35-yard line early in the<br />\nfirst quarter. Jones, the Franklin<br />\nand Marshall fullback, tied the<br />\nscore with a place kick from the<br />\nfield in the second period. The<br />\nLancastrians advanced the ball<br />\ndangerously near the Hopkins goal<br />\nline, but the Hopkins players succeeded in holding their heavier op<br />\nponents for downs, and obtained<br />\nthe ball on their two-yard line.<br />\nGillett punted out of danger.<br />\nPlay was about even in the third<br />\nperiod, though for a time Hopkins<br />\nmade some headway with a succession of forward passes.

The terms upon which<br />\nthey are granted are misunderstood.<br />\nThe advantages which they carry to<br />\nthe recipient are not properly estimated. Many people think that the<br />\npurpose of the scholarships is to<br />\npick up a husky American athlete,<br />\nand set him down to the study of<br />\nGreek grammar in a seat of learning three centuries behind the times.<br />\nToo often, perhaps, this has<br />\nseemed to be their result, but nothing could be further from their purpose.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, the ideal for<br />\nwhich Oxford strives is the very<br />\nideal which, more than any other,<br />\nis necessary in our American life<br />\nof today. The study of Greek<br />\ngrammar or of Greek poetry even<br />\nis not the be-all and end-all of an<br />\nOxford education; the whole aim<br />\nof that education is to impart a<br />\nbroad culture and to cultivate a<br />\nthoughtful attitude toward the problems which surround us. Here in<br />\nAmerica we all seem to have two<br />\nfaults: We know some one thing<br />\nas well as it can be known, and<br />\nbecause of our complete mastery of<br />\nthis one thing we feel competent to<br />\nmake up our minds about all the<br />\nother things in the world in a moment.

But some of the tendencies<br />\nthat have appeared in certain of<br />\nour colleges and universities have<br />\nseemed to be due to a failure to perceive clearly that such institutions<br />\nmust be of broad service to the<br />\nwhole community or else must suffer loss of power within themselves<br />\nto perform even their restricted<br />\ntask.<br />\n\"When an institution is carried<br />\non in large part for the sake of<br />\nits own prestige and with regard to<br />\nthe pleasures and social well-being<br />\nof its students it cannot express<br />\ntendencies toward luxury, selfishness, excess and vainglory.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be endorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nwhich, upon request, will be withheld.]<br />\n<br />\nOctober 19, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nDEAR SIR\u2014Last year<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEws-<br />\n<br />\nLETTER published several letters<br />\n<br />\nstating reasons why there should<br />\nbe a non-fraternity representative<br />\non the Cotillon Board. However,<br />\nprobably because of the fact that<br />\nnon-fraternity representation was<br />\nnot suggested until after the Board<br />\nhad been definitely formed, no steps<br />\nwere taken to bring it about. But,<br />\nnow, we are yet to have the first<br />\ncotillon, and now seems to be the<br />\ntime to suggest non-fraternity representation again.<br />\nIt is in the hands of the fraternity men, I am told, to grant this<br />\nrepresentation. That is, it is in the<br />\nhands of the Cotillon Board. One<br />\nvote against such representation, I<br />\nam also told, will be enough to reject it entirely. All six votes are<br />\nneeded to welcome it. I, therefore,<br />\nwrite my letter for the fraternity<br />\nmen, who influence these votes, and<br />\n<br />\nespecially for the members of the<br />\nCotillon Board, and ask that the<br />\nquestion be carefully and earnestly<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nMy reasons why the non-fraternity men should have a representative on the Cotillon Board are as<br />\nfollows: In the first place, granting the non-fraternity men representation will be showing them<br />\ndue courtesy. The cotillons are<br />\ndances for all the students and by<br />\nall the students. In other words,<br />\nthey are Hopkins dances. They are<br />\nnot fraternity dances. Moreover,<br />\nthe non-fraternity men attend the<br />\ndances in large numbers. It is,<br />\nthen, courtesy due the non-fraternity men that they be granted the<br />\npower of electing, on the board that<br />\narranges the dances for all the students, one of their own number to<br />\nrepresent them.<br />\nIn the second place, it is on the<br />\ngrounds of justice, that the nonfraternity men should have this representation. On the one hand,<br />\nevery single fraternity man who attends the Hopkins dances has, on<br />\nthe board that arranges the dances,<br />\na representative upon whose name<br />\nhe has cast a vote. On the other<br />\nhand, although the non-fraternity<br />\nmen who attend the dances are as<br />\nlarge in number as the 'members<br />\nfrom any one fraternity, yet they<br />\nhave no representative at all. This<br />\nis a condition of affairs that is<br />\nmanifestly not just.<br />\n<br />\nI may, too, in the third place,<br />\nsay that the cotillons, with the help<br />\nof non - fraternity representation,<br />\nwill be more successful, in that they<br />\nwill be more truly Hopkins dances;<br />\nfor the extra man on the board<br />\nwill be able to get subscriptions<br />\nfrom non - fraternity men more<br />\nreadily than a fraternity man can,<br />\njust as a member of one fraternity<br />\ncan get subscriptions from the<br />\nmembers of that fraternity more<br />\nreadily than a person can who is a<br />\nmember of another fraternity. The<br />\nprobabilty is that most of a nonfraternity man's friends are among<br />\nnon-fraternity men. In addition to<br />\nthis, the non-fraternity men, who<br />\nwill be indirectly helping to arrange<br />\nthe cotillons, will be more personally interested in them and will attend them in Still larger numbers.<br />\nThe cotillons will indeed be Hopkins dances.<br />\nLet me say, in conclusion, that I<br />\nam confident that there is, in almost<br />\nevery Hopkins student, a high sense<br />\nof justice, courtesy and loyalty to<br />\nHopkins. I am confident that when<br />\na question is brought to his attention, which involves courtesy and<br />\njustice to his fellows, he will decide<br />\nit in a way that is right.<br />\nYours truly,<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nKIRK<br />\nEstablished 1817<br />\nFor Ninety-Five years the Silverware made by<br />\nthis house has been acknowledged the<br />\nmost beautiful in America.<br />\n<br />\nThe Standard is Maintained<br />\nWe invite inspection and direct particular attention to the moderate price at which<br />\nour product is offered.<br />\n<br />\nSamuel Kirk & Son Co.<br />\n106-108 East Baltimore Street<br />\nThe oldest existing Silversmiths in America.<br />\n<br />\nARTHUR C.

In<br />\nthe classes of 1913 and 1914, figures enough were assembled to enable one to form certain conclusions<br />\nwith regard to the question. No<br />\nfigures at all were available for the<br />\nClass of 1915.<br />\nIn the Class of 1913, fourteen of<br />\nthe twenty-six men approached, had<br />\nentered college at the age of 18.<br />\nIn the Class of 1914, thirteen out<br />\nof the thirty-four men approached,<br />\nhad entered college at the age of<br />\n17. In the. freshman class, on the<br />\nother hand, the single age, including the largest number of men, was<br />\n18, as in the Class of 1913. Of the<br />\nmen approached in the Class of<br />\n1913, two had entered college aged<br />\n20; fourteen, aged i8; five, aged 17;<br />\none, aged 16; one aged 15. In the<br />\nClass of 1914, three at the time of<br />\ntheir entrance were 20, six were<br />\n19, seven were 18, thirteen were<br />\n17, and five were 16. Of the men<br />\napproached, this gives an average<br />\nentrance age of 18.1 for the Class<br />\nof 1913, of 17.6 for the Class of<br />\n1914. The average age in the<br />\nfreshman class is 17.9.<br />\nOne noteworthy fact, however, is<br />\nthat the age of the matriculates in<br />\nthe freshman class is uniformly below that of the candidates for matriculation. Among these men, indeed, the average was only 17.6,<br />\nas in the Class of 1914. It is the<br />\nnon-matriculates who most frequently \"drop out\" in the progress<br />\nof a class through college, and it<br />\nis, therefore, probable that the average of entrance among the men who<br />\nform the Class of 1916\u2014three years<br />\nfrom now\u2014will be considerably<br />\nlower than the 17.9 years shown<br />\ntoday. At all events, as was stated<br />\nin the editorial, there is a considerable difference between the average<br />\nage of the men in '13 and of those<br />\nin '14, though hardly so great as<br />\nwe expected. The freshmen, on<br />\nthe other hand, have not the excuse<br />\nof premature juvenility for their<br />\nshowing in the scholarship contest.<br />\n<br />\nHoward Novelty Co.<br />\n323 N.

Sir William<br />\nwas presented for the degree by<br />\nDean Griffin, secretary of the Academic Council, but contrary to custom, the speech of presentation was<br />\nmade by President Remsen himself.<br />\nThe President referred to his first<br />\nmeeting with the illustrious British<br />\nscientist. In 1871 a young Scotchman came to the front door of the<br />\nchemical laboratory. at the University of Tubingen, and knocked. The<br />\nfront door was not in general use,<br />\nentrance and egress being had by<br />\nthe back one, but of this the young<br />\nstranger was ignorant. At length<br />\nPresident Remsen, then an assistant<br />\nin the laboratory, had his attention<br />\nattracted by the knocking, and with<br />\nhis face and hands grimy from.the<br />\ncoal with which he was working,<br />\nwent to the door and opened it,<br />\ncoming face to face for the first<br />\ntime with William Ramsay.<br />\nThe President then spoke briefly<br />\nof the achievements which since<br />\nthat first meeting have brought the<br />\n'Young Scotchman fame and honors.<br />\nIn the early nineties Lord Ramsay,<br />\n\u2022in his experiments to determine the<br />\nweight of nitrogen, discovered that<br />\nthe nitrogen of the air was slightly<br />\nheavier than that obtained from<br />\nother sources. This Ramsay showed<br />\nto be due to the presence of an<br />\ninert gas, which he called Argon;<br />\nand by this demonstration he first<br />\ncame into world-wide prominence.<br />\nHe has since discovered three other<br />\nrare inert gases in the atmosphere.<br />\nAfter what President Remsen _facetiously called \"the radio-active period of chemistry\" set in, Sir William was the first to call attention<br />\nto the fact that radium is constantly<br />\ndisintegrating by sending out substances into the atmosphere; and<br />\none of these substances, known as<br />\nHelium, he was the earliest to discover existing upon the earth.<br />\nThese discoveries have a deep bearing upon the old problem of the<br />\ntransmutation of elements; and the<br />\nPresident reminded his audience<br />\nthat Sir William is at present engaged upon much the same problem as that which exercised the ingenuity of the alchemists.<br />\nAfter receiving the degree, Sir<br />\nWilliam made a brief speech of<br />\nthanks, mentioning his kindly recollection of the long essays which<br />\nPresident Remsen used to make<br />\nhim write at Tubingen, and expressing his gratification at being<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY<br />\n1912.<br /><br />\nRHODES EXAMINATIONS HELD<br /><br />\nHOPKINS LOSES HARD GAME<br /><br />\nHopkins and St. John's Men Try for<br />\nScholarship Getz, Brown, Niles and<br />\nMarshall Candidates.<br /><br />\nFranklin and Mar:hall Victorious, But<br />\nBlack and Blue Makes a Very Creditable Showing\u2014Two Field Goals.<br /><br />\nThe examinations for the Rhodes<br />\nScholarship from Maryland were<br />\nheld in McCoy Hall last Tuesday<br />\nand Wednesday.

From this point<br />\nthe Franklin and Mar-shall team<br />\ncarried the ball across the line on<br />\nthe third attempt.

The<br />\nLancastrians advanced the ball<br />\ndangerously near the Hopkins goal<br />\nline, but the Hopkins players succeeded in holding their heavier op<br />\nponents for downs, and obtained<br />\nthe ball on their two-yard line.<br />\nGillett punted out of danger.<br />\nPlay was about even in the third<br />\nperiod, though for a time Hopkins<br />\nmade some headway with a succession of forward passes.

The terms upon which<br />\nthey are granted are misunderstood.<br />\nThe advantages which they carry to<br />\nthe recipient are not properly estimated. Many people think that the<br />\npurpose of the scholarships is to<br />\npick up a husky American athlete,<br />\nand set him down to the study of<br />\nGreek grammar in a seat of learning three centuries behind the times.<br />\nToo often, perhaps, this has<br />\nseemed to be their result, but nothing could be further from their purpose.<br />\nAs a matter of fact, the ideal for<br />\nwhich Oxford strives is the very<br />\nideal which, more than any other,<br />\nis necessary in our American life<br />\nof today. The study of Greek<br />\ngrammar or of Greek poetry even<br />\nis not the be-all and end-all of an<br />\nOxford education; the whole aim<br />\nof that education is to impart a<br />\nbroad culture and to cultivate a<br />\nthoughtful attitude toward the problems which surround us.

But some of the tendencies<br />\nthat have appeared in certain of<br />\nour colleges and universities have<br />\nseemed to be due to a failure to perceive clearly that such institutions<br />\nmust be of broad service to the<br />\nwhole community or else must suffer loss of power within themselves<br />\nto perform even their restricted<br />\ntask.<br />\n\"When an institution is carried<br />\non in large part for the sake of<br />\nits own prestige and with regard to<br />\nthe pleasures and social well-being<br />\nof its students it cannot express<br />\ntendencies toward luxury, selfishness, excess and vainglory.

All communications, as<br />\nevidence of good faith, should be endorsed with the name of the writer,<br />\nwhich, upon request, will be withheld.]<br /><br />\nOctober 19, 1912.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nDEAR SIR\u2014Last year<br /><br />\nTHE NEws-<br /><br />\nLETTER published several letters<br /><br />\nstating reasons why there should<br />\nbe a non-fraternity representative<br />\non the Cotillon Board. However,<br />\nprobably because of the fact that<br />\nnon-fraternity representation was<br />\nnot suggested until after the Board<br />\nhad been definitely formed, no steps<br />\nwere taken to bring it about. But,<br />\nnow, we are yet to have the first<br />\ncotillon, and now seems to be the<br />\ntime to suggest non-fraternity representation again.<br />\nIt is in the hands of the fraternity men, I am told, to grant this<br />\nrepresentation. That is, it is in the<br />\nhands of the Cotillon Board. One<br />\nvote against such representation, I<br />\nam also told, will be enough to reject it entirely. All six votes are<br />\nneeded to welcome it. I, therefore,<br />\nwrite my letter for the fraternity<br />\nmen, who influence these votes, and<br /><br />\nespecially for the members of the<br />\nCotillon Board, and ask that the<br />\nquestion be carefully and earnestly<br />\nconsidered.<br />\nMy reasons why the non-fraternity men should have a representative on the Cotillon Board are as<br />\nfollows: In the first place, granting the non-fraternity men representation will be showing them<br />\ndue courtesy. The cotillons are<br />\ndances for all the students and by<br />\nall the students. In other words,<br />\nthey are Hopkins dances. They are<br />\nnot fraternity dances. Moreover,<br />\nthe non-fraternity men attend the<br />\ndances in large numbers. It is,<br />\nthen, courtesy due the non-fraternity men that they be granted the<br />\npower of electing, on the board that<br />\narranges the dances for all the students, one of their own number to<br />\nrepresent them.<br />\nIn the second place, it is on the<br />\ngrounds of justice, that the nonfraternity men should have this representation. On the one hand,<br />\nevery single fraternity man who attends the Hopkins dances has, on<br />\nthe board that arranges the dances,<br />\na representative upon whose name<br />\nhe has cast a vote. On the other<br />\nhand, although the non-fraternity<br />\nmen who attend the dances are as<br />\nlarge in number as the 'members<br />\nfrom any one fraternity, yet they<br />\nhave no representative at all. This<br />\nis a condition of affairs that is<br />\nmanifestly not just.<br /><br />\nI may, too, in the third place,<br />\nsay that the cotillons, with the help<br />\nof non - fraternity representation,<br />\nwill be more successful, in that they<br />\nwill be more truly Hopkins dances;<br />\nfor the extra man on the board<br />\nwill be able to get subscriptions<br />\nfrom non - fraternity men more<br />\nreadily than a fraternity man can,<br />\njust as a member of one fraternity<br />\ncan get subscriptions from the<br />\nmembers of that fraternity more<br />\nreadily than a person can who is a<br />\nmember of another fraternity. The<br />\nprobabilty is that most of a nonfraternity man's friends are among<br />\nnon-fraternity men. In addition to<br />\nthis, the non-fraternity men, who<br />\nwill be indirectly helping to arrange<br />\nthe cotillons, will be more personally interested in them and will attend them in Still larger numbers.<br />\nThe cotillons will indeed be Hopkins dances.<br />\nLet me say, in conclusion, that I<br />\nam confident that there is, in almost<br />\nevery Hopkins student, a high sense<br />\nof justice, courtesy and loyalty to<br />\nHopkins. I am confident that when<br />\na question is brought to his attention, which involves courtesy and<br />\njustice to his fellows, he will decide<br />\nit in a way that is right.<br />\nYours truly,<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nKIRK<br />\nEstablished 1817<br />\nFor Ninety-Five years the Silverware made by<br />\nthis house has been acknowledged the<br />\nmost beautiful in America.<br /><br />\nThe Standard is Maintained<br />\nWe invite inspection and direct particular attention to the moderate price at which<br />\nour product is offered.<br /><br />\nSamuel Kirk &amp; Son Co.<br />\n106-108 East Baltimore Street<br />\nThe oldest existing Silversmiths in America.<br /><br />\nARTHUR C.

The class meets on<br />\nMondays, Wednesdays and Fridays,<br />\nfrom 5 to 6 P. M., and attendance<br />\non it is compulsory for freshmen,<br />\nunless they are out for some 'varsity team.<br />\nAfter the Christmas holidays, the<br />\nmembers of the class are divided<br />\ninto two teams\u2014the Whites and the<br />\nBlues\u2014and athletic and gymnastic<br />\ncontests of various kinds are held.<br />\n\"Chinning\" and \"dipping,\" potato<br />\nraces, high jumping, broad jumping, and many other events are contested. Five points are given for<br />\nfirst place, three for second, and one<br />\nfor third in all events but the big<br />\nrelay race, in which every member<br />\nof the two teams runs. This race<br />\ncounts ten points for the winning<br />\nteam, and always arouses great enthusiasm.<br />\nAt the end. of the gymnasium<br />\nseason, bronze medals are awarded<br />\nto all the members of the team<br />\nwhich makes the most points and<br />\na silver medal is given to the<br />\nman making the highest individual<br />\nrecord.<br />\nThe entrance hall of the cage has<br />\nbeen freshened up with red and<br />\nwhite paint, and the gymnasium<br />\nfloor has been newly painted, while<br />\nthe apparatus has been put in excellent shape, so that the best results may be obtained, and the interest in the work bids fair to become more ardent this year than<br />\never before. With such a numerous<br />\nand husky freshman class, some<br />\nrecords are due to fall before the<br />\nseason is over.<br />\nAn ancient punster once remarked<br />\nthat \"some people will stand upon<br />\na needle's point and argue about<br />\na needless point.\"<br />\nIn Samuel Sewall's Diary, under<br />\nApril 3, 1708, we read the words:<br />\n\"I went to Cous.

M.<br />\nThe teams which I lopkins meet<br />\nthe remainder of the season figured<br />\nin Saturday's games according to<br />\nthe scores in the table above. Of<br />\nthe six teams, three won their<br />\ngames, one being Galaudet, which<br />\nplayed Baltimore City College, a<br />\nteam much lighter and younger,<br />\nand only won after 22 points had<br />\nbeen scored against her. That<br />\nleaves only two teams which won<br />\ncreditable victories \u2014 Swarthmore<br />\nand Virginia Military Institute.<br />\nSwarthmore beat the Navy after<br />\nthe Navy had scored a touchdown<br />\nwithin the first five minutes of the<br />\nopening quarter. Th2 Middies,<br />\nthereafter, could do not!lino- to<br />\nwithstand the well-drilled attack of<br />\nSwarthmore<br />\nthe Quaker lads.<br />\nseems to be the surprise this year<br />\namong the smaller college teams.<br />\nThe 'Varsity plays Stevens in two<br />\nweeks. Saturday's defeat for this<br />\nteam is the fourth of the season,<br />\ntwo of which were large-score<br />\ngames with Princeton and West<br />\nPoint.<br />\nSt. John's fought a stubborn battle against Washington and Lee.<br />\nThe score was tied at 14 points<br />\neach, when Washington and Lee<br />\nforged ahead in the last two<br />\nquarters, and won out by ten points.<br />\nSt. John's has a team which has<br />\nfought just as hard in each previous battle this year, arid trimmed<br />\nthe Franklin and Marshall team<br />\nwhich beat the 'Varsity on Saturday, though at the time the Pennsylvanians were in a crippled condition.<br />\nWestern Maryland continues to<br />\nplay a wretched game. Her behavior in the game Saturday against<br />\nVirginia Polytechnic Institute was<br />\nfull of blunders and poor playing,<br />\nconsequently, Virginia Polytechnic<br />\nInstitute rolled up a score of 44<br />\nto o.<br />\nVirginia Military Academy, which<br />\ncomes to Homewood for the first<br />\ntime on Thanksgiving Day,trounced<br />\nthe University of Virginia, 19 to<br />\no. The Baltimore papers give<br />\nmerely the score of the game,<br />\nthough one can imagine that Virginia Military Institute must have<br />\na strong team to beat Virginia, unless the Virginia team is much<br />\nworse than last year's combination.<br /><br />\nAverage Age of Entrance Determined for<br />\nVarious Classes-1913 Showed 18.1;<br />\n1914, 17.6, and 1916, 17.9.<br /><br />\nWith the intention of seeing<br />\nwhether the impression voiced in<br />\nlast week's editorial on \"Freshman<br />\nScholarships\" would be verified by<br />\nthe facts, Tim NEws-LErrER has<br />\ngathered during the past week<br />\nsome interesting statistics as to the<br />\nage at which men enter Hopkins.<br />\nComplete statistics were not available, except in the case of the freshman class, for which they were kindly furnished by Registrar Ball. In<br />\nthe classes of 1913 and 1914, figures enough were assembled to enable one to form certain conclusions<br />\nwith regard to the question. No<br />\nfigures at all were available for the<br />\nClass of 1915.<br />\nIn the Class of 1913, fourteen of<br />\nthe twenty-six men approached, had<br />\nentered college at the age of 18.<br />\nIn the Class of 1914, thirteen out<br />\nof the thirty-four men approached,<br />\nhad entered college at the age of<br />\n17. In the. freshman class, on the<br />\nother hand, the single age, including the largest number of men, was<br />\n18, as in the Class of 1913. Of the<br />\nmen approached in the Class of<br />\n1913, two had entered college aged<br />\n20; fourteen, aged i8; five, aged 17;<br />\none, aged 16; one aged 15. In the<br />\nClass of 1914, three at the time of<br />\ntheir entrance were 20, six were<br />\n19, seven were 18, thirteen were<br />\n17, and five were 16. Of the men<br />\napproached, this gives an average<br />\nentrance age of 18.1 for the Class<br />\nof 1913, of 17.6 for the Class of<br />\n1914. The average age in the<br />\nfreshman class is 17.9.<br />\nOne noteworthy fact, however, is<br />\nthat the age of the matriculates in<br />\nthe freshman class is uniformly below that of the candidates for matriculation. Among these men, indeed, the average was only 17.6,<br />\nas in the Class of 1914. It is the<br />\nnon-matriculates who most frequently \"drop out\" in the progress<br />\nof a class through college, and it<br />\nis, therefore, probable that the average of entrance among the men who<br />\nform the Class of 1916\u2014three years<br />\nfrom now\u2014will be considerably<br />\nlower than the 17.9 years shown<br />\ntoday. At all events, as was stated<br />\nin the editorial, there is a considerable difference between the average<br />\nage of the men in '13 and of those<br />\nin '14, though hardly so great as<br />\nwe expected. The freshmen, on<br />\nthe other hand, have not the excuse<br />\nof premature juvenility for their<br />\nshowing in the scholarship contest.<br /><br />\nHoward Novelty Co.<br />\n323 N.
