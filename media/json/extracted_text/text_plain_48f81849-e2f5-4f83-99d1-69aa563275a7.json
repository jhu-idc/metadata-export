The<br />\nCUS is fairly effective at getting<br />\nstudent views. It would be very<br />\ndifficult for the CUS to paint a<br />\nfalse picture, since I see several<br />\nstudents a day. It's very easy for<br />\nstudents to come in and tell me<br />\ntheir gripes and they do. If I<br />\nwant to know what students are<br />\nthinking it's very easy for. me<br />\njust to ask whoever is here. If<br />\nthey're here on some other issue,<br />\nI can just say,\"And by the way,<br />\nwhat do you think of such and<br />\nsuch?\" I get a cross sample of<br />\nstudents that way. I may be<br />\ndeluding myself into thinking<br />\nthat I actually, through my<br />\ninformal sampling techniques,<br />\nknow what the students are<br />\nthinking, but I don't think I'm<br />\ndeluding myself.<br />\nN-L: But you wouldn't feel<br />\nprompted to ask the SC about<br />\nan issue?<br />\nHooker: I've never asked the Sc<br />\nanything because I have the<br />\nCUS, which is my formal avenue<br />\nto the students. Now as you<br />\nknow there's a relationship between the CUS and the SC. I<br />\nhave asked the SC president to<br />\nserve as an ex-officio member of<br />\nthe CUS largely because I<br />\nthought that the SC's view<br />\nshould be represented on the<br />\nCUS.<br />\nr assume, rightly or<br />\nwrongly, that the SC represents<br />\nthe student body; it just seemed<br />\nto me reasonable that the formal<br />\nbody that represents the student<br />\nbody and the head of that body<br />\n<br />\nshould have some intimate concern for and connection with the<br />\nacademic oversight body of<br />\nundergraduate studies, which is<br />\nthe CUS. That's really my only<br />\nrelationship with the SC. As far<br />\nas I know the SC has never<br />\nsought my view on anything and<br />\nI've never sought their view on<br />\nanything. I see the SC as being<br />\nconcerned with (Hooker paused<br />\nfor a moment) now this may be<br />\nunfair to them but just from<br />\nreading their accounts in the N-L<br />\nfor the last four years it seems to<br />\nme that they are a body that has<br />\na sense of their self-importance<br />\nthat is probably inflated. It's<br />\nkind of like a mutual admiration<br />\nsociety where they get together<br />\nand feel important. The thing<br />\nthat amuses he is that they have<br />\nlong debates about things like El<br />\nSalvador. And who cares what<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins SC thinks<br />\nabout Latin American? The<br />\nstudents don't, I'm sure. I don't<br />\n'think that they represent the<br />\npoint of view of the students,<br />\ntheir constituent body, when<br />\nthey debate Latin American<br />\npolitics.<br />\nI think that there are issues<br />\nthat the SC should be worried<br />\nabout. I think they should be<br />\nworried about undergraduate<br />\neducation and I wish they were,<br />\nbecause that would tell me that<br />\nthe students were passionately<br />\ninterested.<br />\nBut I'm being a bit hard on<br />\nthe SC. The truth is that in<br />\naddition to debating Latin<br />\nAmerican politics they also<br />\ndebate issues regarding undergraduate- education, and that<br />\nseems to me to be happening<br />\nmore this year than last year.<br />\nLast year it seemed that the<br />\nmeetings were basically infighting and this year they spent a lot<br />\nof time talking about the Spring<br />\nFair, but they also, it seems,<br />\nthrough the committees talk<br />\nabout issues that are important<br />\nto undergraduate education.<br />\nN-L: Have you ever discussed in<br />\na meeting with your fellow<br />\ndeans positions the SC has taken<br />\n<br />\non various campus issues?<br />\nHooker: When the deans talk<br />\nabout the students, they talk<br />\nabout the students and they<br />\ndon't talk about the SC. We<br />\ndon't distinguish clearly between<br />\nthe SC and things that we here<br />\nelsewhere about what the students believe or think or feel<br />\npassionately about. So the SC is<br />\nsort of lumped together with the<br />\nmassive entity of students. It is<br />\nfair to say that the deans think<br />\nin their own hearts that they<br />\nhave a low opinion of the SC<br />\nbecause it has made itself look<br />\nsilly in public in recent years by<br />\nall the infighting. Particularly<br />\ndevastating for their image was<br />\nthat thing last year when the old<br />\nCouncil voted something and<br />\nthen the new Council came in<br />\nand overturned the old Council<br />\nor something like that--I don't<br />\neven remember what the issue<br />\nwas. Whatever it was it looked<br />\nextremely silly. ...That was like a<br />\nKeystone Cops episode, and the<br />\nCouncil's inability to fix on a<br />\ndate for Spring Fiar was like a<br />\nKeystone Cops episode. To<br />\nadministrators, and presumably<br />\neverybody that read the N-L, it<br />\nlooks like the Council is impotent.<br />\nI've made a claim, and that<br />\nis that the SC looks like a farce.<br />\nThere are two possible conclusions to draw from that. One is<br />\nthat we shouldn't continue the<br />\nfarce, that it should be abolished. But that's not my conclusion. My conclusion is that the<br />\nCouncil should reform itself,<br />\nthat the Council should become<br />\nstrong and active and powerful<br />\nand important, because I think<br />\nthe students need a student<br />\ngovernment body and it is the<br />\nCouncil. The students should<br />\nreform their student government<br />\nbody.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the<br />\nstands the SC takes on campus<br />\nissues generally relfect the views<br />\nof the majority of undergraduates?<br />\nHooker: No, I don't think so.<br />\nThey may sometimes do but I<br />\n<br />\nthink that they do is accidental.<br />\nMy impression is from reading<br />\nthe N-L that SC members vote<br />\ntheir own sentiments and not<br />\nwhat they regard as the sense of<br />\nthe student body. I don't think<br />\nmany SC members go out and<br />\npoll students to find out what<br />\nthey think about issues and then<br />\ngo in and vote what their constituents believe.<br />\nN-L: Do you see any advantages<br />\nin abolishing the SC?<br />\nHooker: No, I don't see any<br />\nadvantages at all in abolishing<br />\nthe SC. If you abolished it right<br />\nnow and reconstituted it tomorrow that may be good because it<br />\n<br />\nDean Hooker<br />\nwould shake people up. But we<br />\ndon't have a mechanism for<br />\ndoing that. So I think the<br />\nCouncil should reform itself.<br />\nN-L: What would be the advantages of retaining a reformed<br />\nCouncil?<br />\nHooker:<br />\nThe advantages of<br />\nretaining a reformed Council are<br />\nthat it gives students a role in<br />\ngovernance of the institution, it<br />\nassures that the students' voice<br />\nwill be heard, it gives students a<br />\nsense of responsibility and a<br />\nsense of power and a sense of<br />\nthe possibility of accomplishment. It's the difference between a people who are led and<br />\npeople who leading. If the<br />\nstudents have a student government then they are leading, and<br />\nif they don't they're just led<br />\n<br />\nPro Council<br />\n<br />\nDean Hall Says Council Is Imperative<br />\nIt would be a travesty if the they pull it together, it's 300% are similar experiences we've come very close to speaking for<br />\n,<br />\nSC were abolished, not so much better than what I could do had, because at one time I was the students here at Hopkins-can what he or she's like and all the<br />\nas what it would do to me being an administrator.

But I live in a constant<br />\nstate of mild frustration that the<br />\nSC is not the kind of body<br />\nthat I would like it to be, which<br />\nis one that's passionately interested in undergraduate education.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the<br />\nmajority<br />\nof undergraduates<br />\nwould vote to abolish the SC if a<br />\nreferendum to do so was held<br />\ntoday?<br />\nHooker: No, because I think<br />\nmost of them would think,<br />\n\"What's the use, why go out and<br />\nvote.\" If they had to vote, they<br />\nwould vote to abolish it probably, but I don't think you could<br />\nget them to turn out to vote to<br />\nabolish it because they wouldn't<br />\n:hink it was worth their time to<br />\ndo so.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the SC<br />\nis addressing campus issues<br />\nwhich are of most concern to<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nHooker: No. Well now, wait-they may be, because I'm not<br />\nsure<br />\nthat<br />\nundergraduates<br />\n(Hooker stopped in mid-sentence here) This is where I think<br />\nthat the SC needs to take<br />\nleadership. I'm not sure that the<br />\nundergraduates are clear about<br />\nwhat ought to be the issues that<br />\nthey're interested in because<br />\nmost undergraduates come to<br />\nthe University a little dazed and<br />\nawed by the complexity and the<br />\nstructure of the University, by<br />\ndepartmental organization, by<br />\nthe rules and regulations of<br />\nundergraduate education, and<br />\nthey come believing that somebody knows what's best for<br />\nthem and that those people who<br />\nknow what's best for them have<br />\nset it up. So they don't really, I<br />\nthink, begin to reflect on whether they're getting the kind of<br />\neducation that they want and<br />\nneed until they've been here a<br />\nwhile...I don't think that the SC<br />\nis addressing issues which ought<br />\nto be of concern to undergraduates because I think those issues<br />\nare about the quality of educationaat the University.<br />\n<br />\n\fThe Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nGo Greyhound, and leave the writing to us.<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the Johns Hopkins University.

Mark Twain in<br />\nLetters from<br />\nthe<br />\nEarth<br />\nbrilliantly and bitterly decried<br />\nthe hypocrisy, brutality and<br />\nsexual repressiveness of the<br />\nBiblical God and his disciples.<br />\nThe Testaments and modern<br />\nfundamentalists use fear to control the masses. Fear of pregnancy, V.D., dance, The Who,<br />\ncommies, homosexual teachers,<br />\nand fear of a superbeing with the<br />\nego, temperament, and magnanimity of a 15th century B.C.<br />\nMesopotamian King. Considering a monogamous,child-rearing,<br />\nChristian woman's position--at<br />\nthe sexual, social and economic<br />\nmercy of her husband--her faith<br />\nin a savior Jesus isn't a bad idea.<br />\nFundamentalist leaders enjoy the power this system gives<br />\nthem.

But as<br />\nAlstaire Cooke noted, when<br />\nRome was approaching its height<br />\nof power and wealth, Caligula<br />\nwas emperor and sexual aberrance was the norm.

It<br />\nis a lesson in history that as<br />\nRome later declined the advent<br />\nof Christian morality as official<br />\nRoman edict slowed the empire's fall not one iota.<br />\nI do not condemn Christianity en masse. It has many fine<br />\nideals and people. I just wish<br />\nthey consistently followed them.<br />\nLet's face a fact. Sex is fun.<br />\nAnd it's good for you. Done<br />\nwith a little care, it is just<br />\nabout the safest physical activity<br />\naround. It can be an enjoyable<br />\nway of getting to know someone, or the most basic expression of love. Sex if the bond<br />\nthat ties humanity. The Moral<br />\nMinority claims to expound love<br />\nand a return to old fashioned<br />\nliberties. Don't let them fool<br />\nyou. They want control of our<br />\nprivate sexual behavior. Not<br />\nonly is this none of their business, sexual abstinence itself<br />\nis--boring. So enjoy.

The closest thing<br />\nto a response that the Fast for<br />\nHunger has received so far from<br />\nthe El Salvador types is a few<br />\ndoodlings on the posters.

At the other<br />\nextreme, to say 65 is the beginning of the end, is also hyperbole, at least for the healthy<br />\nelderly. This milestone marks<br />\nnot the beginning of the end but<br />\nthe end of the beginning, as<br />\nChurchill retorted to Hitler's<br />\ntaunt that the London blitz was<br />\nthe beginning of the end for<br />\nBritain. The past up to 65 is<br />\nonly prologue.

Two<br />\ndays later, the student received a<br />\ncurious letter which appointed<br />\none aichard Macksey as adviser.<br />\nThe letter was signed Petroluem<br />\nG. Nesby.<br />\nThis example is not cited to<br />\ndeify the man. Simply stated,<br />\nthere is something pleasing hearing this: a teacher respects his<br />\nstudents rather than browbeats<br />\nthem. It could make a headline<br />\nin the Daily News.<br />\nA few excessive words<br />\nabout his knowledge.<br />\nHis<br />\npersonal library contains an<br />\nestimated 30,000 volumes. He is<br />\npossessor of a morbid sense of<br />\nhumor--he was the only winner<br />\nof last year's News-Letter quiz in<br />\nfamous deaths. He believes the<br />\nfunniest opening sequence of a<br />\nmovie is the first five minutes<br />\nof Blazing Saddles. He has met<br />\nan interesting array of talents.<br />\nWhen he mentions meeting film<br />\ncritic John Simon, or poets<br />\nRobert Lowell and Theodore<br />\nRoethke, he is believable. But<br />\nthe list continues. When I read<br />\n<br />\nMy Wicked, Wicked Ways, and<br />\ntold him how much I enjoyed it,<br />\nhe agreed that it might be<br />\nHollywood's<br />\nbest<br />\nautobiography. Then he added,\"I met<br />\nFlynn in the late 1950s in a bar<br />\nin the south of France. I was a<br />\nstudent then, traveling with<br />\nsome friends, and we started<br />\ntalking to him about sailing. I<br />\nthink he was upset about his<br />\nyacht starting to corrode. He<br />\nlooked pretty down and out, so<br />\nwe treated him to a drink.\"<br />\nOne last anecdote, then we<br />\nshall silence this gush. At the<br />\nend of my sophomore year, I<br />\nwas spending a lonely 20th<br />\nbirthday at an Orioles-.Red Sox<br />\ngame. Towards the middle of<br />\nthe game, I noticed Macksey<br />\ntake a seat several rows below<br />\nme (so they are human). I<br />\njoined him and we watched the<br />\ngame. At the seventh inning, a<br />\ntrivia question was placed on the<br />\noutfield scoreboard: Name the<br />\nfive MVPs at this game. I knew<br />\nthree, he knew four (we missed<br />\nthe fifth, but it was a trick<br />\nquestion). So, he knows his<br />\nbaseball...that deserves infinite<br />\nrespect. I told him it was my<br />\nbirthday, and he must have<br />\nnoticed that I was far from<br />\nhappy. He invited me back to<br />\nhis home (a beautiful house in<br />\nRoland Park), offered the company of his family, gave me<br />\nwine, then drove me to my<br />\napartment.

There, Americans find they are not as \"deprived\" as they<br />\nthought they would be in a Third World nation.<br />\nThe major deficits, to my mind, are the lack of<br />\nsome of my favorite foods: pizza, \"ethnic\"<br />\nfoods (most of which can be sort of reproduced<br />\nin one's own kitchen) and crabs.<br />\nWe spent about two months in Gaborone,<br />\nlearning the language, Setswana, and about<br />\nTswana culture, from a group of young Botswana teachers. We managed to learn a little<br />\nSetswana, a fair amount about the traditional<br />\nTswana culture which is predominant in the<br />\nvillages, and a lot about how to live an enjoyable<br />\nlife in Botswana. We were treated to two weeks<br />\nof village living, scattered among very rural,<br />\ntraditional families who generally spoke no<br />\nEnglish and had none of life's little luxuries that<br />\nI took so much for granted. There I learned<br />\nwhat it was like to haul water from a considerable distance, warm it over a wood fire, take a<br />\n<br />\nsponge bath, and wash my hair with one scant<br />\nbucketful.<br />\nI was also forced to pick up much more<br />\nSetswana, and learned to deal with the major<br />\nhardship of village life: boredom. There's little<br />\nwork to do in the winter, and the women do<br />\nmost of that\u2014grinding sorghum, fetching water<br />\nand wood, cooking, and caring for the kids.<br />\nSome of my feminist views have been<br />\nslightly altered. I don't like to see all the hard<br />\nwork the women do here (which includes most<br />\nof the farming), but I have a new understanding<br />\nof polygamy, which I used to think ridiculously<br />\nunjust. But in Botswana, adult women significantly outnumber adult men (due to varying<br />\nbirth rates, death rates, and emigration). This<br />\nused to be a polygamous society, but that's<br />\nillegal now. To the detriment of women, the<br />\nmen have adapted. They have mistresses, who<br />\nget pregnant, but may be left entirely on their<br />\nown in taking care of all their fatherless children. They may be lucky ever to find a legal<br />\nhusband who will help care for the kids. Three<br />\ncheers for the missionaries' civilizing influence!<br />\n<br />\nThe men's major duty is to make frequent<br />\nforays to the cattle post to look after their<br />\nmost prized possessions. Cattle for the Botswana are what a white-collar job, money in the<br />\nbank, a nice stock portfolio, a home in the<br />\nsuburbs, and two new cars are for Americans:<br />\nwealth, security, and status. You would no<br />\nmore ask a Botswana how many cattle he had<br />\nthan ask an American how much money he had<br />\nin the bank. But it is of prime importance.<br />\nAbout half of all families have no cattle,<br />\nand most have less than 10. Some families may<br />\nhave herds ranging into the tens of thousands.<br />\nPeople who live in obvious wealth\u2014the government ministers and professional people with nice<br />\nhomes and Mercedes Benzes\u2014can be counted on<br />\nto have vast herds. In fact, many young Botswana men aspire to a good education and a wellpaying job so that they can buy more cattle.<br />\nBut the odd thing is that you can't necessarily,<br />\ntell the cattle baron from the cattle-less peon. A<br />\nman with 10,000 head of cattle may live in the<br />\nsame sort of rondoval (mud hut), wear the same<br />\nsort of old, faded clothes, and eat the same<br />\nsorghum porridge as his destitute neighbor. And<br />\nyou'd never know about his assets, until one day<br />\nhe sells a couple hundred cattle and parks a<br />\nMercedes Benz in front of his rondoval.<br />\nThat's what I find in the village of Mahalapyl, where I live now. Though there are more<br />\nthan 20,000 people here, it's called a village<br />\nbecause it is predominantly \"traditional.\"<br />\nWe're on the rail line and main road, so we have<br />\na little semi-urban downtown of general stores,<br />\ncafes, groceries, and little shops, but there are no<br />\nindustries or office buildings, and most people<br />\nare farmers and cattle holders.<br />\nI live in a one-room, thatched-roof mud<br />\nhut, deep in the village. I lack both running<br />\nwater and electricity. \u2022 I share the house with<br />\nants and lizards, and share the outhouse with<br />\nthree-inch-long flying cockroaches. People in<br />\ngeneral share the village space with cattle,<br />\ndonkeys, goats, sheep, and children. A Peace<br />\nCorps colleague lives next door to me, and we<br />\nare the only whites in our part of town. So<br />\nwe've made friends with our neighbors, improved on our Setswana, and learned to relax<br />\nover home-brewed beer in the local \"shebeens.\"<br />\nIt takes me 35 minutes to walk to work<br />\nduring the dry season, when I can cross the dry<br />\nriver bed; 45 minutes during the rainy season<br />\nwhen the river is full and I have to cross on the<br />\nbridge. I get up just before dawn, and go to bed<br />\naround 9:30 p.m.<br />\nOn the weekends, if I want to, I can go to<br />\none of three bars, to Chick's Disco (with its<br />\n12-record repertoire and partially mirrored ball),<br />\nor invite friends over for an American dinner.<br />\nEntertaining with dinner here, and eating<br />\n<br />\n\fin general, is a delight: with so many cattle<br />\naround, I can buy more steak than I can eat at<br />\none meal with 75 cents. I can have a steak<br />\nbarbecue bash and spend only a few dollars. I've<br />\nalso found that I like mealie-meal and \"fat<br />\ncakes\" (fried dough). I eat oranges all winter,<br />\nmangoes all summer, and put on weight.<br />\nPeople here eat only one thing I would<br />\ndescribe as disgusting: dried caterpillars. But<br />\nmost people understand when I decline to eat<br />\nthem. If they seem surprised, I tell them I eat<br />\ncrabs. They laugh uproariously, make faces, and<br />\nthe point has been made.<br />\nCultural adjustment took a little longer.<br />\nIt is imperative to pause and greet everyone you<br />\npass, and to greet anyone you deal with in a<br />\nstore or business. Failure to do so gets you<br />\nslow, cold service and a bad reputation. That, I<br />\ncan deal with\u2014it is a pleasant, charming custom.<br />\nWhat I can't deal with is the sharing aspect of<br />\nthe culture. Those who have wealth are expected to share with those who don't. This manifests itself when strangers greet you and ask for<br />\nmoney in the same breath. This invariably puts<br />\nme in a bad mood, and it happens at least thrice<br />\na day. On a Peace Corps living allowance, one<br />\ncould soon get nickled and dimed to death, so I<br />\ndon't ever give in: I feign ignorance of Setswana<br />\nto old ladies; to able-bodied, healthy adults I<br />\nsay I have no money (a blatant lie is more<br />\nacceptable than a frank refusal). To little kids, I<br />\neither refuse (if I'm in a good mood), or I<br />\nthreaten to beat them (if I'm in a bad mood).<br />\nIt's mostly a cultural shock to my system. It's<br />\nunnerving. Back home, if a stranger asks you for<br />\nmoney, he is either a) demanding it at the point<br />\nof a gun, b) a Moonie, or c) over 80, blind or<br />\ncrippled, and playing the accordion. Here the<br />\nguy who just got out of his Mercedes Benz might<br />\nbe the one asking for money. That's when I<br />\ncounter with a request for cattle.<br />\nMy work is my major challenge/frustration (again depending on my mood.) I must<br />\nteach Development Studies (economics) to kids<br />\nwho, for the most part, barely understand any<br />\nEnglish. Yes\u2014money and banking to kids who<br />\nconceive of wealth primarily in terms of cattle;<br />\nsupply and demand, though they live in a<br />\nco-operative society; and international trade<br />\nwhere families are almost self-sufficient. Land<br />\nhere is allocated to each family by the chief, so<br />\nmy students are baffled by the concept of<br />\nproperty ownership, keystone of capitalist<br />\neconomic orthodoxy. But I have to teach it.<br />\nIt's in the syllabus.<br />\nI'm learning a lot more than my students.<br />\nI teach in a private, community \"self-help\"<br />\njunior secondary school. Here in Botswana, the<br />\nbest students go to government schools which<br />\nalso get the best student faculties, and the most<br />\nmoney. Education here is geared to the almighty Junior Certificate Exam. Grades in<br />\nschool don't matter, just the score on that one<br />\nexam. Consequently, the first two years, the JC<br />\nseems too remote for students to worry about,<br />\n<br />\nand they goof off. The third year, they start to<br />\nworry and get serious\u2014the JC is the ticket to<br />\njobs and further education.<br />\nThe issue of development in Botswana is<br />\nhard for a westerner like me to fathom, once<br />\nconfronted 'with it. The value structure\u2014of<br />\ncattle and sharing\u2014works well, for the most part.<br />\nThe \"stark, striking contrast between rich and<br />\npoor,\" which we hear so much about, sounds<br />\nlike a lot of trite rhetoric here, where it's more<br />\nsubtle than in most places. I don't see starvation<br />\nin Mahalapye, but all it would take is a couple of<br />\nyears of drought. Botswana's doing reasonably<br />\nwell feeding its people\u2014now--but everything<br />\ndepends on each year's rain.<br />\nThe government and the national economy are also fairly healthy at the moment,<br />\nbacked by the longest-known diamond deposits<br />\nin the world. These mines, however, are controlled by South Africa's DeBeers, the \"free\"<br />\nworld's diamond monopoly. In general, South<br />\nAfrica dominates Botswana's economy. With<br />\nthe exceptions of meat, sorghum, and m.ealiemeal, the vast majority of things found for sale<br />\nin Botswana's stores come from South Africa,<br />\nthrough South Africa, or from South African<br />\ncontrolled companies in Botswana. When it<br />\ncomes to food, if it doesn't come from South<br />\nAfrica, then it's Nestle's.<br />\nThose who knew me at Hopkins will<br />\nappreciate the irony\u2014after four years of campaigning against South Africa and Nestle's on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, I come to Africa and find<br />\nmyself unable to avoid them. Being in Botswana, I am more convinced than ever that those<br />\ntwo entities are fully deserving of every kind of<br />\npressure that can possibly be brought to bear<br />\non them; yet I must support them by doing<br />\nbusiness with them, or starve.<br />\nFor those interested in the Nestle's<br />\ncampaing, please note that Nestle's \"Lactogen\"<br />\nis found on every store shelf with instructions<br />\nand warnings conveniently written in English<br />\nand Afrikaans, the language of mcst South<br />\nAfrican whites. No pictures. And, of course,<br />\nliteracy in English, not to mention Afrikaans,<br />\namong the women here is very low.<br />\nAs for South Africa, I've learned much<br />\nfrom the many former South Africans living in<br />\nBotswana\u2014the two major gripes are the everyday<br />\nhassles of apartheid and its restrictions, and the<br />\nsupreme humiliation of being denied the most<br />\nbasic rights of citizenship in the land of their<br />\nbirth and of their ancestors. That's the crux of<br />\nthe issue. The whites may compromise on<br />\nalmost every aspect of apartheid, but that most<br />\nbasic one, yet that fundamental question of<br />\ncitizenship is the issue for Africans. No one<br />\nshould expect the whites to change their minds<br />\nor to resist successfully forever; no one should<br />\nexpect the Africans to give up or back down.<br />\nTherefore, no one should expect a peaceful<br />\nsolution, and, consequently, no one should<br />\nexpect the majority to appreciate the position of<br />\nthe United States, if it continues its practical<br />\n<br />\nI live in a one-room, thatched-roof mud hut, deep in the village.<br />\n<br />\nMy host in Kalamer<br />\ncooperation with the apartheid regime.<br />\nFor those who are curious about the new<br />\nZimbabwe, here are my impressions after a<br />\ntwo-week visit:<br />\nFirst, the Africans seem to hold next to<br />\nnothing in the way of a grudge against the<br />\nwhites. I found them always extremely friendly<br />\nand helpful. The whites...well...a lot of them<br />\nhave a long way to go. For the first time in my<br />\nlife, while visiting a young white couple, I heard<br />\nsomeone utter the phrase \"inferior race.\" I saw<br />\nrednecks shout racist comments, and then<br />\ndemand help from seom nearby \"boys\" to push<br />\ntheir car. The \"boys\" helped. Africans are out<br />\nto prove that they are above racism, and so they<br />\nseem to be. Meanwhile, many whites gripe that<br />\nZimbabwe is no longer \"our country\" and make<br />\nplans to emigrate. How have they suffered at<br />\nthe hands of the new majority-based government? I never received an answer to that<br />\nquestion.<br />\nYes, there are problems in Zimbabwe.<br />\nNkomo's followers, (mostly rebels) and Prime<br />\nMinister Mugabe's followers (mostly Shona)<br />\nhave centuries-old conflicts that stand in the<br />\nway of cooperation. Pessimists see civil war<br />\naround the corner, and optimists hope the<br />\ntension can be kept under control for the time<br />\nbeing. I'm no prophet, but I do have a lot of<br />\nrespect for Mugabe's sense of practicality and<br />\njustice. Former minister Edward Tekere (who<br />\nmurdered a white farmer) was acquitted on a<br />\n.technical loophole that used to protect whites<br />\nwho murdered blacks (since abolished), but<br />\nMugabe has removed him from the government.<br />\nMugabe demoted Nkomo, but successfully<br />\nreached a compromise political settlement.<br />\nRadical government officials make extravagant<br />\npromises about what the new majority-based,<br />\nsocialist government will do for Africans, but<br />\nMugabe insists that there will be no miracles. I<br />\nonly hope he continues to receive U.S. support.<br />\nI doubt anyone in Zimbabwe would do any<br />\nbetter. While I'm on the subject of politics, I<br />\nmight add that it's very embarrassing trying to<br />\nexplain Ronald Reagan to my hosts: \"A movie<br />\nstar? Worried about Russians...Here!?\"<br />\nFinally, for those who are interested in<br />\nthe Peace Corps, I will say this: On the one<br />\nhand, the Peace Corps ranks among the worst of<br />\nThings<br />\nbungling government bureaucracies.<br />\ntangled<br />\nthe<br />\ninto<br />\ndived<br />\nfirst<br />\nI<br />\nwrong<br />\nwhen<br />\nwent<br />\npile of red tape that is the Peace Corps application procedure. I'm still trying to straighten out<br />\na number of mistakes they've made. But I'm<br />\nhere in Africa, doing constructive work, and<br />\nhaving an incredible, fascinating learning experience. For people with few useful skills or work<br />\nexperience, like many Hopkins students, the<br />\nPeace Corps provides a free trip abroad, two<br />\nyears of work experience, a reasonable standard<br />\nof living (once you get used to it), language and<br />\ncultural training, job training, complete medical<br />\ncare, and all the support and advice you could<br />\nhope for. Vacation time and pay are generous.<br />\n(I just got back from Tanzania.) My only word<br />\nof advice for those who apply to Peace Corps is<br />\nthis: don't give up. They make a lot of stupid<br />\nmistakes and discourage you and put you<br />\nthrough hal but if you just stick it out, you've<br />\npassed their first test. I never thought I'd make<br />\nit, but I'm here and I like it.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 14 / APRIL 3,1981<br />\n444 4 4 44.44<br />\n<br />\n4 4<br />\n<br />\n4 11 444444444E4 4444444444#404*****444#4 444444444 *-44444444 ,4444444444444 *******<br />\n<br />\nSTUDENT COUNCIL FILM SERIES<br />\nPRESENTS:<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class Film Series Presents<br />\n\u2014*NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME,<br />\nFILMGOER<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nsr<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nDr. No<br />\nFriday 9:00<br />\nSaturday 7:00, 11:00<br />\n<br />\nGoldfinger<br />\nkiday 7:00,11:00<br />\n<br />\nME SPECIAL EDMON<br />\n<br />\nCLOSE<br />\nENCOUNTER<br />\nOF THE THIRD KIND<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nSaturday 9:00<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n7- 9:45<br />\n<br />\n$2.50 Double Feature w/ID $2.00 Single Feature w/o ID<br />\n$1.50 Single Feature w/ID $3.00 Double Feature w/o ID<br />\n<br />\nadmission:<br />\n$2.50<br />\n$1.50 with college ID<br />\n<br />\nGREAT HALL<br />\n<br />\nAPRIL 3 Et 4<br />\n*********************************************** ******* *********************<br />\n<br />\nK70<br />\n<br />\n%)<br />\n<br />\nCoDIEV 0<br />\n<br />\nEna<br />\n<br />\nQ'TEEM<br />\n<br />\nDATES: Friday, May 1st; Saturday, May 2nd<br />\n<br />\n(between end of classes & reading week)<br />\nTIME:<br />\n<br />\nRegular bus- Leave Baltimore 4:30 PM,<br />\nArrive in DC 5:30 PM<br />\nLeave D.C. 12:45 AM,<br />\nArrive in Baltimore 1:30 AM<br />\n<br />\nSPECIAL ATTRACTIONS:<br />\n<br />\nAdvance sale seats to<br />\nTHE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW<br />\n(midnight show starts at 12:15, ends about 2:30)<br />\nSpecial bus to and from Rocky Horror:<br />\nLeave Baltimore 10:45 PM, arrive in.D.C. 11:45<br />\nLeave D.C. 15 minutes after end of show<br />\nAdvance sale tickets to<br />\nI'M GETTING MY ACT TOGETHER AND TAKING<br />\nIT ON THE ROAD<br />\nExcellent seats available, showtime 8:00 PM<br />\nInformation Booklets available, containing subway,<br />\nbus, and taxi maps, list of restaurants and clubs<br />\nin Georgetown area.<br />\nIf you want to go along, complete the form and<br />\nreturn it in person or via Campus mail to:<br />\nStudent Council Office, Levering Hall<br />\n(Attention: Susan Weissfeld)<br />\nIMPORTANT: If you wish to leave on the regular<br />\n<br />\nbus and return on the special bus, you must notify<br />\nSusan Weissfeld, Jeremy Preiss, or Ernie Breitenger<br />\nat 338-8203.<br />\n<br />\nName<br />\n<br />\nPhone No./Box No.<br />\n<br />\n[ 1 1.

But I have<br />\nalso intertwined the flashy enthusiasms of<br />\nmusical theater, the lethal left jab of the<br />\nshort story, the sachet of personal letters,<br />\nthe oompah of American history, and<br />\noratory in the bow-wow style.\" He then<br />\ngoes on to propose a generic name for<br />\nthis type of book: blivit, which he<br />\nloosely defines as \"two pounds of shit in<br />\na one-pound bag.\"<br />\nActually, Palm Sunday falls<br />\nsomewhere between the two descriptions.<br />\nIn essence, it is a collection of essays,<br />\nspeeches, fictions and non-fictions (some<br />\npreviously published, others not), suspended from a running narrative which<br />\nattempts to keep them strung together.<br />\nThe effect is not unlike laundry on a<br />\nclothesline; unfortunately, however,some<br />\nof the clothes are cleaner than others.<br />\nAmong the more interesting<br />\n\"bits\" of the collage are: \"The Noodle<br />\nFactory,\" a speech given in October 1976<br />\nduring the dedication of a library at<br />\nConnecticut College; \"How to Write<br />\nwith Style,\" an essay written for an<br />\nInternational Paper Company advertising ,<br />\ncampaign; a self-interview originally published in the Paris Review; and \"Palm<br />\nSunday,\" a sermon delivered at St.<br />\nClement's Episcopal Church in New York<br />\nCity in 1980. What makes these pieces so<br />\nfascinating is how well each reveals some<br />\nfacet of Vonnegut's mind and character.<br />\nEach is a testament to the earnestness of<br />\n<br />\nhis ideas and the simple elegance of his<br />\nstyle. Some examples:<br />\n\"Film is a perfect prescription for<br />\npeople who will not or cannot read, and<br />\nhave no imagination. Since they have no<br />\nimagination, those people can now be<br />\nshown actors and scenery instead--with<br />\nappropriate music and all that.\"<br />\n\"We are members of an egalitarian<br />\nsociety, so there is no reason for us to<br />\nwrite, in case we are not classically<br />\neducated aristocrats, as though we were<br />\nclassically educated aristocrats.\"<br />\n\"If you make people laugh or cry<br />\nabout little black marks on a sheet of<br />\nwhite paper, what is that but a practical<br />\njoke? All the great story lines are great<br />\npractical jokes that people fall for over<br />\nand over again.\"<br />\nWhen Palm Sunday reads like this.<br />\nit runs as smoothly as a new car. But the<br />\nbook does have its share of awkward<br />\nmoments and throwaways. Among these<br />\nare an alphabetical list of all of the<br />\nwriters Vonnegut has met at least once,<br />\nwhich covers a full two and a half pages; a<br />\nrejected introduction to a new edition of<br />\nSwift's Gulliver's Travels; a mildly interesting short story titled \"The Big Space<br />\nFuck;\" and a tedious treatment for a<br />\nmusical comedy based on Stevenson's<br />\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. One long<br />\nsection, a family history covering four<br />\ngenerations of Vonneguts in America<br />\n(written not by Vonnegut but by John<br />\nRauch, the husband of a cousin of<br />\nVonnegut's father) is fairly illuminating<br />\nbut very difficult to follow. At its most<br />\nself-indulgent, the book can be quite bad.<br />\nBut for the most part, Palm<br />\nSunday is an enjoyable read. One memorable section includes an impassioned<br />\nessay on Louis-Ferdinand Celine which<br />\nVonnegut wrote as an introduction to the<br />\nPenguin editions of Celine's last three<br />\nnovels; another features excerpts from<br />\n<br />\nVonnegut's master's thesis in anthropology, rejected by the University of Chicago,<br />\nin which he visually depicts the stories of<br />\nCinderella, the creation, and Kafka's<br />\n\"Metamorphosis,\" among others, by<br />\nplotting them as graphs on a coordinate<br />\nplane.<br />\nThc finest selections included in<br />\nPalm Sunday are those concerning<br />\nfreedom of the press, such as the letter<br />\nVonnegut wrote to Charles McCarthy,<br />\nhead of the school board of Drake,<br />\nNorth Dakota, which in 1973 banned<br />\nVonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five<br />\nfrom classrooms there; and an editorial<br />\non censorship which appeared in the<br />\nLong Island edition of the New York<br />\nTimes in March 1976. It is in these pieces<br />\nthat we get the clearest image of what<br />\nVonnegut's life and work mean to him.<br />\nHe presents himself to McCarthy not so<br />\nmuch as an outraged author but as<br />\na \"planetary citizen,\" deeply hurt by the<br />\nsuppression of ideas, while in the Times<br />\nhe gives deeper and more universal<br />\nsignificance to his frustration:<br />\n\"Whenever ideas are squashed in<br />\nthis country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must<br />\nbe allowed to live. It is time for them to<br />\nrealize that they are attempting to<br />\nexplain America at its bravest and most<br />\noptimistic to orangutangs.<br />\n\"From now on, I intend to limit<br />\nmy discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas<br />\nto this advice: 'Have somebody read the<br />\nFirst Amendment to the United States<br />\nConstitution out loud to you, you<br />\ngod-damned fool!\"'<br />\nOverall, Palm Sunday is an uneven<br />\n<br />\nwork, an interesting premise slightly weak<br />\nin spots but potent nevertheless.<br />\nVonnegut writes:<br />\n\"By reading the<br />\nwritings of the most interesting minds<br />\nin history, we meditate with our own<br />\nminds and theirs as well.\" This volume<br />\noffers the chance to meditate with the<br />\nmind of Kurt Vonnegut, writer and<br />\nplanetary citizen, a chance which if<br />\ntaken nourishes one's own mind in the<br />\nprocess.<br />\n<br />\nDead Animation<br />\n<br />\nBakshi's American Slop<br />\nBY TOM GRANT<br />\nRalph Bakshi has blown his third<br />\nchance with his \"living animation\"<br />\ntechnique in American Pop. Rotoscoping, the technique of painting over<br />\nlive-action footage, is a cheap excuse for<br />\ntrue animation which is aesthetically and<br />\nartistically difficult to swallow. In Wizards, much of the plot and most of the<br />\ncharacters were unashamed copies taken<br />\nfrom the work of the deceased underBode.<br />\nVaughn<br />\ncartoonist<br />\nground<br />\nBakshi's Lord of the Rings sounded<br />\npromising at its outset but proved to be<br />\nan even greater disappointment. Bakshi<br />\nclaimed he would spend five years working on the film but he produced the<br />\nfinished product in a little more than a<br />\nyear. Even more rotoscoping was used,<br />\nand it looked even worse. Bakshi introduced a new technique which he termed<br />\n\"Living Animation,\" meaning he copied<br />\nthe motions of live actors for the animated figures. Lord of the Rings was<br />\norginally shot completely in live action<br />\nand then \"animated.\" The concept had<br />\nbeen used previously (e.g., Satan in the<br />\n\"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence of<br />\nFantasia was'modeled for Disney studios<br />\nby Bela Lugosi), but Lord of the Rings<br />\nwas made without the meticulousness of<br />\nDisney Studios. In addition to its sloppiness, the animated characters looked silly<br />\nagainst the background of live figures<br />\nthinly veiled by a bit of blurring and<br />\ntinting. In his latest attempt, American<br />\nPop, Bakshi is as commercial and tacky<br />\nas ever.<br />\n<br />\nIn any animated film, the focus is<br />\ninevitably placed upon the technical<br />\naspect, the animation itself. One can<br />\nmake a good science fiction film without<br />\nresorting to flashy special effects by<br />\nJohn Dystra (e.g., The Day the Earth<br />\nStood Still); one can make a good horror<br />\nfilm without depending upon a large<br />\nmake-up budget to make the monstrous<br />\nelement truly horrific (e.g., The Cat<br />\nPeople); one can make a good war film<br />\nwithout thousands of extras, colossal<br />\nexplosions, or convincing war machines<br />\n(e.g., Battleship Potemkin). In any other<br />\ntype of film the technical craft is merely<br />\nicing on the cake, gimmickry which<br />\naugments the film but does not serve as<br />\nits foundation. An animated film is a<br />\ndifferent case; the animation creates the<br />\n<br />\ncharacters, the action, the camera angles,<br />\nand the lighting, so the artistic success of<br />\nthe film depends completely upon the<br />\nanimation. American Pop is a dismal<br />\nfailure for this reason.<br />\nOnce again, Living Animation is a<br />\nsloppy copy of the actions of real actors.<br />\nThe characters' outlines are sketchy and<br />\nill-defined--a person moves his head, and<br />\nhis nose disappears. During the opening<br />\ncredits, Bakshi entices us with marvellous<br />\nsurrealistic paintings depicting the evolution of American popular music, but as<br />\nsoon as the credits disappear, so does the<br />\nlively caricature which these drawings<br />\nAlthough they occasionally<br />\npromise.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n#4*.,<br />\n<br />\nor, *<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\n'II<br />\n. Balcshi shlockifies an intriguing idea to death in American Pop.<br />\n<br />\nappear as background paintings, Bakshi<br />\ndoes nothing of equivalent creativity with<br />\nthe animated characters. Indeed, one<br />\nmay wonder why American Pop is<br />\nanimated at all. Bakshi never exploits the<br />\nwild, magical opportunities afforded by<br />\nanimation--his figures are such one-to-one<br />\nreplications of their live-action counterparts that they are rendered dull and<br />\npointless. The impossible in the average<br />\nBugs Bunny cartoon by Chuck Jones is<br />\nfar more interesting and entertaining than<br />\nwhat Bakshi has to offer us. What we<br />\nhope for is a wild flight into fantasy;<br />\nwhat is delivered is a crude copy of a<br />\nphotograph, nothing more.<br />\nAmerican Pop could have been<br />\nsaved from its mad plunges into mediocrity by its story, but here it fails again.<br />\nBoth Wizards and Lord of the Rings had<br />\nlimited appeal to movie audiences, but<br />\nthe subject matter of American Pop<br />\nreaches out to everyone. The movie is<br />\nabout four generations of musicians: a<br />\nvaudevillian who loses in a mob war the<br />\nwoman he loves and made a singing star;<br />\na brilliant jazz pianist who loses his live in<br />\nWorld War II; a Dylanesque songwriter of<br />\nthe 60's who allows his drug habit to<br />\ndestroy his career; and the final incarnation of the family, a snappy coke dealer<br />\nturned New Wave superstar. Unfortunately, the epic sweep of time and culture<br />\nlacks any concatenation; Bakshi's jumping from one era of American popular<br />\ncont. on p. 16<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / APRIL 3, 1981<br />\n<br />\nAt The Mechanic<br />\n<br />\nTwo Hours Of Fosse's Frenzied Choreography<br />\nBY DAVID M. EINOLF<br />\nDuring its three-year run on<br />\nBroadway, critics have acclaimed Dancin'<br />\nas a \"celebration of the art.\" The Bob<br />\nFosse production, which runs at the<br />\nMechanic Theatre through April 18, is<br />\nless a celebration of the art of dancing<br />\nthan a celebration of Fosse's work.<br />\nWarned at the outset that the production<br />\nwill contain \"no drama,\" just \"dancin',<br />\ndancin', dancin',\" the viewer is still<br />\nunprepared for what ensues. The musical<br />\nruns less than two hours and is broken<br />\ninto three acts. The action on stage never<br />\nstops, save for the intermissions. The<br />\neighteen members of the company<br />\ndance furiously when on stage, blending<br />\nFosse's curious fascination for avantgarde dance with traditional styles.<br />\nIn Dancin', Fosse conglomerates<br />\nall of his aspirations and ideas, transferring his dreams into the bodies of the<br />\ncompany and deriving a vicarious pleasure<br />\nfrom the result. Indeed he seems to<br />\nbe asking that the audience do the same<br />\nthing, structuring the performances to<br />\nbuild towards a frenzied climax as the<br />\nfinal curtain falls. The \"Opening\" mimics<br />\nFosse's techniques in All That Jazz:<br />\ndancers are arrayed, in practice garb,<br />\nalbeit multi-colored for show. The<br />\nfrenzied and sensual act which follows<br />\nhas no set pattern.<br />\nThe next number, Fosse's \"Recollections of an Old Dancer,\" is set to Jerry<br />\nJeff Walker's \"Mr. Bojangles.\" Bojangles<br />\nis personified as an aging minstrel dancer<br />\nwhose youthful spirit floats by in the rear<br />\nand controls the aged body's actions.<br />\n<br />\nLess a celebration of the art of dancing than of Fosse's work.<br />\nThe next, \"Percussion,\" illustrat- who is having a horrid week, everything<br />\nes Fosse's predilection for rapid, staccato is going along well for him. He's got the<br />\nmovements and hard, sensual dance. \"feeling-too-good-today blues.\" Fosse<br />\nAccompanied by an array of percussive uses Cat Stevens' \"Was A Dog A Doughinstruments, the company displays talent nut\" to underline a Dancin'first, a dance<br />\nin adapting themselves to Fosse's improvi- with no foot movement.

The<br />\nCUS is fairly effective at getting<br />\nstudent views. It would be very<br />\ndifficult for the CUS to paint a<br />\nfalse picture, since I see several<br />\nstudents a day. It's very easy for<br />\nstudents to come in and tell me<br />\ntheir gripes and they do. If I<br />\nwant to know what students are<br />\nthinking it's very easy for. me<br />\njust to ask whoever is here. If<br />\nthey're here on some other issue,<br />\nI can just say,\"And by the way,<br />\nwhat do you think of such and<br />\nsuch?\" I get a cross sample of<br />\nstudents that way. I may be<br />\ndeluding myself into thinking<br />\nthat I actually, through my<br />\ninformal sampling techniques,<br />\nknow what the students are<br />\nthinking, but I don't think I'm<br />\ndeluding myself.<br />\nN-L: But you wouldn't feel<br />\nprompted to ask the SC about<br />\nan issue?<br />\nHooker: I've never asked the Sc<br />\nanything because I have the<br />\nCUS, which is my formal avenue<br />\nto the students. Now as you<br />\nknow there's a relationship between the CUS and the SC. I<br />\nhave asked the SC president to<br />\nserve as an ex-officio member of<br />\nthe CUS largely because I<br />\nthought that the SC's view<br />\nshould be represented on the<br />\nCUS.<br />\nr assume, rightly or<br />\nwrongly, that the SC represents<br />\nthe student body; it just seemed<br />\nto me reasonable that the formal<br />\nbody that represents the student<br />\nbody and the head of that body<br /><br />\nshould have some intimate concern for and connection with the<br />\nacademic oversight body of<br />\nundergraduate studies, which is<br />\nthe CUS. That's really my only<br />\nrelationship with the SC. As far<br />\nas I know the SC has never<br />\nsought my view on anything and<br />\nI've never sought their view on<br />\nanything. I see the SC as being<br />\nconcerned with (Hooker paused<br />\nfor a moment) now this may be<br />\nunfair to them but just from<br />\nreading their accounts in the N-L<br />\nfor the last four years it seems to<br />\nme that they are a body that has<br />\na sense of their self-importance<br />\nthat is probably inflated. It's<br />\nkind of like a mutual admiration<br />\nsociety where they get together<br />\nand feel important. The thing<br />\nthat amuses he is that they have<br />\nlong debates about things like El<br />\nSalvador. And who cares what<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins SC thinks<br />\nabout Latin American? The<br />\nstudents don't, I'm sure. I don't<br />\n'think that they represent the<br />\npoint of view of the students,<br />\ntheir constituent body, when<br />\nthey debate Latin American<br />\npolitics.<br />\nI think that there are issues<br />\nthat the SC should be worried<br />\nabout. I think they should be<br />\nworried about undergraduate<br />\neducation and I wish they were,<br />\nbecause that would tell me that<br />\nthe students were passionately<br />\ninterested.<br />\nBut I'm being a bit hard on<br />\nthe SC. The truth is that in<br />\naddition to debating Latin<br />\nAmerican politics they also<br />\ndebate issues regarding undergraduate- education, and that<br />\nseems to me to be happening<br />\nmore this year than last year.<br />\nLast year it seemed that the<br />\nmeetings were basically infighting and this year they spent a lot<br />\nof time talking about the Spring<br />\nFair, but they also, it seems,<br />\nthrough the committees talk<br />\nabout issues that are important<br />\nto undergraduate education.<br />\nN-L: Have you ever discussed in<br />\na meeting with your fellow<br />\ndeans positions the SC has taken<br /><br />\non various campus issues?<br />\nHooker: When the deans talk<br />\nabout the students, they talk<br />\nabout the students and they<br />\ndon't talk about the SC. We<br />\ndon't distinguish clearly between<br />\nthe SC and things that we here<br />\nelsewhere about what the students believe or think or feel<br />\npassionately about. So the SC is<br />\nsort of lumped together with the<br />\nmassive entity of students. It is<br />\nfair to say that the deans think<br />\nin their own hearts that they<br />\nhave a low opinion of the SC<br />\nbecause it has made itself look<br />\nsilly in public in recent years by<br />\nall the infighting. Particularly<br />\ndevastating for their image was<br />\nthat thing last year when the old<br />\nCouncil voted something and<br />\nthen the new Council came in<br />\nand overturned the old Council<br />\nor something like that--I don't<br />\neven remember what the issue<br />\nwas. Whatever it was it looked<br />\nextremely silly. ...That was like a<br />\nKeystone Cops episode, and the<br />\nCouncil's inability to fix on a<br />\ndate for Spring Fiar was like a<br />\nKeystone Cops episode. To<br />\nadministrators, and presumably<br />\neverybody that read the N-L, it<br />\nlooks like the Council is impotent.<br />\nI've made a claim, and that<br />\nis that the SC looks like a farce.<br />\nThere are two possible conclusions to draw from that. One is<br />\nthat we shouldn't continue the<br />\nfarce, that it should be abolished. But that's not my conclusion. My conclusion is that the<br />\nCouncil should reform itself,<br />\nthat the Council should become<br />\nstrong and active and powerful<br />\nand important, because I think<br />\nthe students need a student<br />\ngovernment body and it is the<br />\nCouncil. The students should<br />\nreform their student government<br />\nbody.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the<br />\nstands the SC takes on campus<br />\nissues generally relfect the views<br />\nof the majority of undergraduates?<br />\nHooker: No, I don't think so.<br />\nThey may sometimes do but I<br /><br />\nthink that they do is accidental.<br />\nMy impression is from reading<br />\nthe N-L that SC members vote<br />\ntheir own sentiments and not<br />\nwhat they regard as the sense of<br />\nthe student body. I don't think<br />\nmany SC members go out and<br />\npoll students to find out what<br />\nthey think about issues and then<br />\ngo in and vote what their constituents believe.<br />\nN-L: Do you see any advantages<br />\nin abolishing the SC?<br />\nHooker: No, I don't see any<br />\nadvantages at all in abolishing<br />\nthe SC. If you abolished it right<br />\nnow and reconstituted it tomorrow that may be good because it<br /><br />\nDean Hooker<br />\nwould shake people up. But we<br />\ndon't have a mechanism for<br />\ndoing that. So I think the<br />\nCouncil should reform itself.<br />\nN-L: What would be the advantages of retaining a reformed<br />\nCouncil?<br />\nHooker:<br />\nThe advantages of<br />\nretaining a reformed Council are<br />\nthat it gives students a role in<br />\ngovernance of the institution, it<br />\nassures that the students' voice<br />\nwill be heard, it gives students a<br />\nsense of responsibility and a<br />\nsense of power and a sense of<br />\nthe possibility of accomplishment. It's the difference between a people who are led and<br />\npeople who leading. If the<br />\nstudents have a student government then they are leading, and<br />\nif they don't they're just led<br /><br />\nPro Council<br /><br />\nDean Hall Says Council Is Imperative<br />\nIt would be a travesty if the they pull it together, it's 300% are similar experiences we've come very close to speaking for<br />\n,<br />\nSC were abolished, not so much better than what I could do had, because at one time I was the students here at Hopkins-can what he or she's like and all the<br />\nas what it would do to me being an administrator. There your age and a student.<br />\nother things--but there's a little<br />\nand/or the administration, but<br />\npiece that's different and that's<br />\nthen where would be the interface from the students in those<br />\nbecause it's 1981, the world and<br />\neverything else is different.

If there was no SC,<br />\ngovernance.<br />\nI would think that the students<br />\nIf the question is \"How<br />\nwould invent something; they<br />\nmight not call it a SC...You'd<br />\nsuccessful is the SC?\" the SC is<br />\nas successful as what the student<br />\nhave a body because the issues<br />\nbody puts into it, because it's a<br />\nwon't go away.<br />\nreflection of you--who runs, who<br />\nNow you can complain that<br />\ndoesn't run, who do you elect,<br />\nyour governing body doesn't<br />\npick the right students or ask the<br />\ndo you listen, and do you hold<br />\nright questions, but they still ask .E<br />\nthem responsible. The SC is a<br />\nbetter questions than no onez<br />\nreflection of the student body--if<br />\nbecause they come from the -g<br />\nit's good, if it's bad, the students<br />\nstudents and experience life as.<br />\nsay that. But it's what you<br />\nstudents here. No matter how<br />\nmake it.<br /><br />\nby the rules and regulations of<br />\nthe administration and the<br />\nwhims of the administration.<br />\nN-L: Do you think it would be<br />\npossible to have an effective<br />\nstudent government here?<br />\nHooker: I think it would be.<br />\nThere must be effective forms of<br />\nstudent government somewhere<br />\nin the country. It would be<br />\ninteresting to study the student<br />\ngovernment at other institutions.<br />\nI know there have been a number of institutions that have had<br />\nthe problem that Hopkins has-that the student government<br />\nlooks like a farce and so they<br />\nvote for Porky Pig for SC<br />\npresident or something like that.<br />\nI was in the student government at the University of North<br />\nCarolina at Chapel Hill, and we<br />\nhad a very strong student<br />\ngovernment that I thought was<br />\nvery responsible.<br />\nN-L: When was the last time<br />\nyou were annoyed with the SC<br />\nfor not taking a stand on some<br />\nissues of concern to undergraduates?<br />\nHooker: In a sense there's never<br />\nbeen an instance because I've<br />\nnever expected them to take a<br />\nstand. But I live in a constant<br />\nstate of mild frustration that the<br />\nSC is not the kind of body<br />\nthat I would like it to be, which<br />\nis one that's passionately interested in undergraduate education.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the<br />\nmajority<br />\nof undergraduates<br />\nwould vote to abolish the SC if a<br />\nreferendum to do so was held<br />\ntoday?<br />\nHooker: No, because I think<br />\nmost of them would think,<br />\n\"What's the use, why go out and<br />\nvote.\" If they had to vote, they<br />\nwould vote to abolish it probably, but I don't think you could<br />\nget them to turn out to vote to<br />\nabolish it because they wouldn't<br />\n:hink it was worth their time to<br />\ndo so.<br />\nN-L: Do you think that the SC<br />\nis addressing campus issues<br />\nwhich are of most concern to<br />\nundergraduates?<br />\nHooker: No. Well now, wait-they may be, because I'm not<br />\nsure<br />\nthat<br />\nundergraduates<br />\n(Hooker stopped in mid-sentence here) This is where I think<br />\nthat the SC needs to take<br />\nleadership. I'm not sure that the<br />\nundergraduates are clear about<br />\nwhat ought to be the issues that<br />\nthey're interested in because<br />\nmost undergraduates come to<br />\nthe University a little dazed and<br />\nawed by the complexity and the<br />\nstructure of the University, by<br />\ndepartmental organization, by<br />\nthe rules and regulations of<br />\nundergraduate education, and<br />\nthey come believing that somebody knows what's best for<br />\nthem and that those people who<br />\nknow what's best for them have<br />\nset it up. So they don't really, I<br />\nthink, begin to reflect on whether they're getting the kind of<br />\neducation that they want and<br />\nneed until they've been here a<br />\nwhile...I don't think that the SC<br />\nis addressing issues which ought<br />\nto be of concern to undergraduates because I think those issues<br />\nare about the quality of educationaat the University.<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nGo Greyhound, and leave the writing to us.<br />\nThe News-Letter is published weekly during the school year by the<br />\nstudents of the Johns Hopkins University.

Two<br />\ndays later, the student received a<br />\ncurious letter which appointed<br />\none aichard Macksey as adviser.<br />\nThe letter was signed Petroluem<br />\nG. Nesby.<br />\nThis example is not cited to<br />\ndeify the man. Simply stated,<br />\nthere is something pleasing hearing this: a teacher respects his<br />\nstudents rather than browbeats<br />\nthem. It could make a headline<br />\nin the Daily News.<br />\nA few excessive words<br />\nabout his knowledge.<br />\nHis<br />\npersonal library contains an<br />\nestimated 30,000 volumes. He is<br />\npossessor of a morbid sense of<br />\nhumor--he was the only winner<br />\nof last year's News-Letter quiz in<br />\nfamous deaths. He believes the<br />\nfunniest opening sequence of a<br />\nmovie is the first five minutes<br />\nof Blazing Saddles. He has met<br />\nan interesting array of talents.<br />\nWhen he mentions meeting film<br />\ncritic John Simon, or poets<br />\nRobert Lowell and Theodore<br />\nRoethke, he is believable. But<br />\nthe list continues. When I read<br /><br />\nMy Wicked, Wicked Ways, and<br />\ntold him how much I enjoyed it,<br />\nhe agreed that it might be<br />\nHollywood's<br />\nbest<br />\nautobiography. Then he added,\"I met<br />\nFlynn in the late 1950s in a bar<br />\nin the south of France. I was a<br />\nstudent then, traveling with<br />\nsome friends, and we started<br />\ntalking to him about sailing. I<br />\nthink he was upset about his<br />\nyacht starting to corrode. He<br />\nlooked pretty down and out, so<br />\nwe treated him to a drink.\"<br />\nOne last anecdote, then we<br />\nshall silence this gush. At the<br />\nend of my sophomore year, I<br />\nwas spending a lonely 20th<br />\nbirthday at an Orioles-.Red Sox<br />\ngame. Towards the middle of<br />\nthe game, I noticed Macksey<br />\ntake a seat several rows below<br />\nme (so they are human). I<br />\njoined him and we watched the<br />\ngame. At the seventh inning, a<br />\ntrivia question was placed on the<br />\noutfield scoreboard: Name the<br />\nfive MVPs at this game. I knew<br />\nthree, he knew four (we missed<br />\nthe fifth, but it was a trick<br />\nquestion). So, he knows his<br />\nbaseball...that deserves infinite<br />\nrespect. I told him it was my<br />\nbirthday, and he must have<br />\nnoticed that I was far from<br />\nhappy. He invited me back to<br />\nhis home (a beautiful house in<br />\nRoland Park), offered the company of his family, gave me<br />\nwine, then drove me to my<br />\napartment.

There, Americans find they are not as \"deprived\" as they<br />\nthought they would be in a Third World nation.<br />\nThe major deficits, to my mind, are the lack of<br />\nsome of my favorite foods: pizza, \"ethnic\"<br />\nfoods (most of which can be sort of reproduced<br />\nin one's own kitchen) and crabs.<br />\nWe spent about two months in Gaborone,<br />\nlearning the language, Setswana, and about<br />\nTswana culture, from a group of young Botswana teachers. We managed to learn a little<br />\nSetswana, a fair amount about the traditional<br />\nTswana culture which is predominant in the<br />\nvillages, and a lot about how to live an enjoyable<br />\nlife in Botswana. We were treated to two weeks<br />\nof village living, scattered among very rural,<br />\ntraditional families who generally spoke no<br />\nEnglish and had none of life's little luxuries that<br />\nI took so much for granted. There I learned<br />\nwhat it was like to haul water from a considerable distance, warm it over a wood fire, take a<br /><br />\nsponge bath, and wash my hair with one scant<br />\nbucketful.<br />\nI was also forced to pick up much more<br />\nSetswana, and learned to deal with the major<br />\nhardship of village life: boredom. There's little<br />\nwork to do in the winter, and the women do<br />\nmost of that\u2014grinding sorghum, fetching water<br />\nand wood, cooking, and caring for the kids.<br />\nSome of my feminist views have been<br />\nslightly altered. I don't like to see all the hard<br />\nwork the women do here (which includes most<br />\nof the farming), but I have a new understanding<br />\nof polygamy, which I used to think ridiculously<br />\nunjust. But in Botswana, adult women significantly outnumber adult men (due to varying<br />\nbirth rates, death rates, and emigration). This<br />\nused to be a polygamous society, but that's<br />\nillegal now. To the detriment of women, the<br />\nmen have adapted. They have mistresses, who<br />\nget pregnant, but may be left entirely on their<br />\nown in taking care of all their fatherless children. They may be lucky ever to find a legal<br />\nhusband who will help care for the kids. Three<br />\ncheers for the missionaries' civilizing influence!<br /><br />\nThe men's major duty is to make frequent<br />\nforays to the cattle post to look after their<br />\nmost prized possessions. Cattle for the Botswana are what a white-collar job, money in the<br />\nbank, a nice stock portfolio, a home in the<br />\nsuburbs, and two new cars are for Americans:<br />\nwealth, security, and status. You would no<br />\nmore ask a Botswana how many cattle he had<br />\nthan ask an American how much money he had<br />\nin the bank. But it is of prime importance.<br />\nAbout half of all families have no cattle,<br />\nand most have less than 10. Some families may<br />\nhave herds ranging into the tens of thousands.<br />\nPeople who live in obvious wealth\u2014the government ministers and professional people with nice<br />\nhomes and Mercedes Benzes\u2014can be counted on<br />\nto have vast herds. In fact, many young Botswana men aspire to a good education and a wellpaying job so that they can buy more cattle.<br />\nBut the odd thing is that you can't necessarily,<br />\ntell the cattle baron from the cattle-less peon. A<br />\nman with 10,000 head of cattle may live in the<br />\nsame sort of rondoval (mud hut), wear the same<br />\nsort of old, faded clothes, and eat the same<br />\nsorghum porridge as his destitute neighbor. And<br />\nyou'd never know about his assets, until one day<br />\nhe sells a couple hundred cattle and parks a<br />\nMercedes Benz in front of his rondoval.<br />\nThat's what I find in the village of Mahalapyl, where I live now. Though there are more<br />\nthan 20,000 people here, it's called a village<br />\nbecause it is predominantly \"traditional.\"<br />\nWe're on the rail line and main road, so we have<br />\na little semi-urban downtown of general stores,<br />\ncafes, groceries, and little shops, but there are no<br />\nindustries or office buildings, and most people<br />\nare farmers and cattle holders.<br />\nI live in a one-room, thatched-roof mud<br />\nhut, deep in the village. I lack both running<br />\nwater and electricity. \u2022 I share the house with<br />\nants and lizards, and share the outhouse with<br />\nthree-inch-long flying cockroaches. People in<br />\ngeneral share the village space with cattle,<br />\ndonkeys, goats, sheep, and children. A Peace<br />\nCorps colleague lives next door to me, and we<br />\nare the only whites in our part of town. So<br />\nwe've made friends with our neighbors, improved on our Setswana, and learned to relax<br />\nover home-brewed beer in the local \"shebeens.\"<br />\nIt takes me 35 minutes to walk to work<br />\nduring the dry season, when I can cross the dry<br />\nriver bed; 45 minutes during the rainy season<br />\nwhen the river is full and I have to cross on the<br />\nbridge. I get up just before dawn, and go to bed<br />\naround 9:30 p.m.<br />\nOn the weekends, if I want to, I can go to<br />\none of three bars, to Chick's Disco (with its<br />\n12-record repertoire and partially mirrored ball),<br />\nor invite friends over for an American dinner.<br />\nEntertaining with dinner here, and eating<br /><br />\nin general, is a delight: with so many cattle<br />\naround, I can buy more steak than I can eat at<br />\none meal with 75 cents. I can have a steak<br />\nbarbecue bash and spend only a few dollars. I've<br />\nalso found that I like mealie-meal and \"fat<br />\ncakes\" (fried dough). I eat oranges all winter,<br />\nmangoes all summer, and put on weight.<br />\nPeople here eat only one thing I would<br />\ndescribe as disgusting: dried caterpillars. But<br />\nmost people understand when I decline to eat<br />\nthem. If they seem surprised, I tell them I eat<br />\ncrabs. They laugh uproariously, make faces, and<br />\nthe point has been made.<br />\nCultural adjustment took a little longer.<br />\nIt is imperative to pause and greet everyone you<br />\npass, and to greet anyone you deal with in a<br />\nstore or business. Failure to do so gets you<br />\nslow, cold service and a bad reputation. That, I<br />\ncan deal with\u2014it is a pleasant, charming custom.<br />\nWhat I can't deal with is the sharing aspect of<br />\nthe culture. Those who have wealth are expected to share with those who don't. This manifests itself when strangers greet you and ask for<br />\nmoney in the same breath. This invariably puts<br />\nme in a bad mood, and it happens at least thrice<br />\na day. On a Peace Corps living allowance, one<br />\ncould soon get nickled and dimed to death, so I<br />\ndon't ever give in: I feign ignorance of Setswana<br />\nto old ladies; to able-bodied, healthy adults I<br />\nsay I have no money (a blatant lie is more<br />\nacceptable than a frank refusal). To little kids, I<br />\neither refuse (if I'm in a good mood), or I<br />\nthreaten to beat them (if I'm in a bad mood).<br />\nIt's mostly a cultural shock to my system. It's<br />\nunnerving.

But I have to teach it.<br />\nIt's in the syllabus.<br />\nI'm learning a lot more than my students.<br />\nI teach in a private, community \"self-help\"<br />\njunior secondary school. Here in Botswana, the<br />\nbest students go to government schools which<br />\nalso get the best student faculties, and the most<br />\nmoney. Education here is geared to the almighty Junior Certificate Exam. Grades in<br />\nschool don't matter, just the score on that one<br />\nexam. Consequently, the first two years, the JC<br />\nseems too remote for students to worry about,<br /><br />\nand they goof off. The third year, they start to<br />\nworry and get serious\u2014the JC is the ticket to<br />\njobs and further education.<br />\nThe issue of development in Botswana is<br />\nhard for a westerner like me to fathom, once<br />\nconfronted 'with it. The value structure\u2014of<br />\ncattle and sharing\u2014works well, for the most part.<br />\nThe \"stark, striking contrast between rich and<br />\npoor,\" which we hear so much about, sounds<br />\nlike a lot of trite rhetoric here, where it's more<br />\nsubtle than in most places. I don't see starvation<br />\nin Mahalapye, but all it would take is a couple of<br />\nyears of drought. Botswana's doing reasonably<br />\nwell feeding its people\u2014now--but everything<br />\ndepends on each year's rain.<br />\nThe government and the national economy are also fairly healthy at the moment,<br />\nbacked by the longest-known diamond deposits<br />\nin the world. These mines, however, are controlled by South Africa's DeBeers, the \"free\"<br />\nworld's diamond monopoly. In general, South<br />\nAfrica dominates Botswana's economy. With<br />\nthe exceptions of meat, sorghum, and m.ealiemeal, the vast majority of things found for sale<br />\nin Botswana's stores come from South Africa,<br />\nthrough South Africa, or from South African<br />\ncontrolled companies in Botswana. When it<br />\ncomes to food, if it doesn't come from South<br />\nAfrica, then it's Nestle's.<br />\nThose who knew me at Hopkins will<br />\nappreciate the irony\u2014after four years of campaigning against South Africa and Nestle's on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus, I come to Africa and find<br />\nmyself unable to avoid them. Being in Botswana, I am more convinced than ever that those<br />\ntwo entities are fully deserving of every kind of<br />\npressure that can possibly be brought to bear<br />\non them; yet I must support them by doing<br />\nbusiness with them, or starve.<br />\nFor those interested in the Nestle's<br />\ncampaing, please note that Nestle's \"Lactogen\"<br />\nis found on every store shelf with instructions<br />\nand warnings conveniently written in English<br />\nand Afrikaans, the language of mcst South<br />\nAfrican whites.

That's the crux of<br />\nthe issue. The whites may compromise on<br />\nalmost every aspect of apartheid, but that most<br />\nbasic one, yet that fundamental question of<br />\ncitizenship is the issue for Africans. No one<br />\nshould expect the whites to change their minds<br />\nor to resist successfully forever; no one should<br />\nexpect the Africans to give up or back down.<br />\nTherefore, no one should expect a peaceful<br />\nsolution, and, consequently, no one should<br />\nexpect the majority to appreciate the position of<br />\nthe United States, if it continues its practical<br /><br />\nI live in a one-room, thatched-roof mud hut, deep in the village.<br /><br />\nMy host in Kalamer<br />\ncooperation with the apartheid regime.<br />\nFor those who are curious about the new<br />\nZimbabwe, here are my impressions after a<br />\ntwo-week visit:<br />\nFirst, the Africans seem to hold next to<br />\nnothing in the way of a grudge against the<br />\nwhites. I found them always extremely friendly<br />\nand helpful. The whites...well...a lot of them<br />\nhave a long way to go. For the first time in my<br />\nlife, while visiting a young white couple, I heard<br />\nsomeone utter the phrase \"inferior race.\" I saw<br />\nrednecks shout racist comments, and then<br />\ndemand help from seom nearby \"boys\" to push<br />\ntheir car. The \"boys\" helped. Africans are out<br />\nto prove that they are above racism, and so they<br />\nseem to be. Meanwhile, many whites gripe that<br />\nZimbabwe is no longer \"our country\" and make<br />\nplans to emigrate. How have they suffered at<br />\nthe hands of the new majority-based government? I never received an answer to that<br />\nquestion.<br />\nYes, there are problems in Zimbabwe.<br />\nNkomo's followers, (mostly rebels) and Prime<br />\nMinister Mugabe's followers (mostly Shona)<br />\nhave centuries-old conflicts that stand in the<br />\nway of cooperation. Pessimists see civil war<br />\naround the corner, and optimists hope the<br />\ntension can be kept under control for the time<br />\nbeing. I'm no prophet, but I do have a lot of<br />\nrespect for Mugabe's sense of practicality and<br />\njustice. Former minister Edward Tekere (who<br />\nmurdered a white farmer) was acquitted on a<br />\n.technical loophole that used to protect whites<br />\nwho murdered blacks (since abolished), but<br />\nMugabe has removed him from the government.<br />\nMugabe demoted Nkomo, but successfully<br />\nreached a compromise political settlement.<br />\nRadical government officials make extravagant<br />\npromises about what the new majority-based,<br />\nsocialist government will do for Africans, but<br />\nMugabe insists that there will be no miracles. I<br />\nonly hope he continues to receive U.S. support.<br />\nI doubt anyone in Zimbabwe would do any<br />\nbetter. While I'm on the subject of politics, I<br />\nmight add that it's very embarrassing trying to<br />\nexplain Ronald Reagan to my hosts: \"A movie<br />\nstar? Worried about Russians...Here!?\"<br />\nFinally, for those who are interested in<br />\nthe Peace Corps, I will say this: On the one<br />\nhand, the Peace Corps ranks among the worst of<br />\nThings<br />\nbungling government bureaucracies.<br />\ntangled<br />\nthe<br />\ninto<br />\ndived<br />\nfirst<br />\nI<br />\nwrong<br />\nwhen<br />\nwent<br />\npile of red tape that is the Peace Corps application procedure. I'm still trying to straighten out<br />\na number of mistakes they've made. But I'm<br />\nhere in Africa, doing constructive work, and<br />\nhaving an incredible, fascinating learning experience. For people with few useful skills or work<br />\nexperience, like many Hopkins students, the<br />\nPeace Corps provides a free trip abroad, two<br />\nyears of work experience, a reasonable standard<br />\nof living (once you get used to it), language and<br />\ncultural training, job training, complete medical<br />\ncare, and all the support and advice you could<br />\nhope for. Vacation time and pay are generous.<br />\n(I just got back from Tanzania.) My only word<br />\nof advice for those who apply to Peace Corps is<br />\nthis: don't give up. They make a lot of stupid<br />\nmistakes and discourage you and put you<br />\nthrough hal but if you just stick it out, you've<br />\npassed their first test.

But I have<br />\nalso intertwined the flashy enthusiasms of<br />\nmusical theater, the lethal left jab of the<br />\nshort story, the sachet of personal letters,<br />\nthe oompah of American history, and<br />\noratory in the bow-wow style.\" He then<br />\ngoes on to propose a generic name for<br />\nthis type of book: blivit, which he<br />\nloosely defines as \"two pounds of shit in<br />\na one-pound bag.\"<br />\nActually, Palm Sunday falls<br />\nsomewhere between the two descriptions.<br />\nIn essence, it is a collection of essays,<br />\nspeeches, fictions and non-fictions (some<br />\npreviously published, others not), suspended from a running narrative which<br />\nattempts to keep them strung together.<br />\nThe effect is not unlike laundry on a<br />\nclothesline; unfortunately, however,some<br />\nof the clothes are cleaner than others.<br />\nAmong the more interesting<br />\n\"bits\" of the collage are: \"The Noodle<br />\nFactory,\" a speech given in October 1976<br />\nduring the dedication of a library at<br />\nConnecticut College; \"How to Write<br />\nwith Style,\" an essay written for an<br />\nInternational Paper Company advertising ,<br />\ncampaign; a self-interview originally published in the Paris Review; and \"Palm<br />\nSunday,\" a sermon delivered at St.<br />\nClement's Episcopal Church in New York<br />\nCity in 1980. What makes these pieces so<br />\nfascinating is how well each reveals some<br />\nfacet of Vonnegut's mind and character.<br />\nEach is a testament to the earnestness of<br /><br />\nhis ideas and the simple elegance of his<br />\nstyle. Some examples:<br />\n\"Film is a perfect prescription for<br />\npeople who will not or cannot read, and<br />\nhave no imagination. Since they have no<br />\nimagination, those people can now be<br />\nshown actors and scenery instead--with<br />\nappropriate music and all that.\"<br />\n\"We are members of an egalitarian<br />\nsociety, so there is no reason for us to<br />\nwrite, in case we are not classically<br />\neducated aristocrats, as though we were<br />\nclassically educated aristocrats.\"<br />\n\"If you make people laugh or cry<br />\nabout little black marks on a sheet of<br />\nwhite paper, what is that but a practical<br />\njoke? All the great story lines are great<br />\npractical jokes that people fall for over<br />\nand over again.\"<br />\nWhen Palm Sunday reads like this.<br />\nit runs as smoothly as a new car. But the<br />\nbook does have its share of awkward<br />\nmoments and throwaways. Among these<br />\nare an alphabetical list of all of the<br />\nwriters Vonnegut has met at least once,<br />\nwhich covers a full two and a half pages; a<br />\nrejected introduction to a new edition of<br />\nSwift's Gulliver's Travels; a mildly interesting short story titled \"The Big Space<br />\nFuck;\" and a tedious treatment for a<br />\nmusical comedy based on Stevenson's<br />\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. One long<br />\nsection, a family history covering four<br />\ngenerations of Vonneguts in America<br />\n(written not by Vonnegut but by John<br />\nRauch, the husband of a cousin of<br />\nVonnegut's father) is fairly illuminating<br />\nbut very difficult to follow. At its most<br />\nself-indulgent, the book can be quite bad.<br />\nBut for the most part, Palm<br />\nSunday is an enjoyable read. One memorable section includes an impassioned<br />\nessay on Louis-Ferdinand Celine which<br />\nVonnegut wrote as an introduction to the<br />\nPenguin editions of Celine's last three<br />\nnovels; another features excerpts from<br /><br />\nVonnegut's master's thesis in anthropology, rejected by the University of Chicago,<br />\nin which he visually depicts the stories of<br />\nCinderella, the creation, and Kafka's<br />\n\"Metamorphosis,\" among others, by<br />\nplotting them as graphs on a coordinate<br />\nplane.<br />\nThc finest selections included in<br />\nPalm Sunday are those concerning<br />\nfreedom of the press, such as the letter<br />\nVonnegut wrote to Charles McCarthy,<br />\nhead of the school board of Drake,<br />\nNorth Dakota, which in 1973 banned<br />\nVonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse-Five<br />\nfrom classrooms there; and an editorial<br />\non censorship which appeared in the<br />\nLong Island edition of the New York<br />\nTimes in March 1976. It is in these pieces<br />\nthat we get the clearest image of what<br />\nVonnegut's life and work mean to him.<br />\nHe presents himself to McCarthy not so<br />\nmuch as an outraged author but as<br />\na \"planetary citizen,\" deeply hurt by the<br />\nsuppression of ideas, while in the Times<br />\nhe gives deeper and more universal<br />\nsignificance to his frustration:<br />\n\"Whenever ideas are squashed in<br />\nthis country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must<br />\nbe allowed to live. It is time for them to<br />\nrealize that they are attempting to<br />\nexplain America at its bravest and most<br />\noptimistic to orangutangs.<br />\n\"From now on, I intend to limit<br />\nmy discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas<br />\nto this advice: 'Have somebody read the<br />\nFirst Amendment to the United States<br />\nConstitution out loud to you, you<br />\ngod-damned fool!\"'<br />\nOverall, Palm Sunday is an uneven<br /><br />\nwork, an interesting premise slightly weak<br />\nin spots but potent nevertheless.<br />\nVonnegut writes:<br />\n\"By reading the<br />\nwritings of the most interesting minds<br />\nin history, we meditate with our own<br />\nminds and theirs as well.\" This volume<br />\noffers the chance to meditate with the<br />\nmind of Kurt Vonnegut, writer and<br />\nplanetary citizen, a chance which if<br />\ntaken nourishes one's own mind in the<br />\nprocess.<br /><br />\nDead Animation<br /><br />\nBakshi's American Slop<br />\nBY TOM GRANT<br />\nRalph Bakshi has blown his third<br />\nchance with his \"living animation\"<br />\ntechnique in American Pop. Rotoscoping, the technique of painting over<br />\nlive-action footage, is a cheap excuse for<br />\ntrue animation which is aesthetically and<br />\nartistically difficult to swallow. In Wizards, much of the plot and most of the<br />\ncharacters were unashamed copies taken<br />\nfrom the work of the deceased underBode.<br />\nVaughn<br />\ncartoonist<br />\nground<br />\nBakshi's Lord of the Rings sounded<br />\npromising at its outset but proved to be<br />\nan even greater disappointment. Bakshi<br />\nclaimed he would spend five years working on the film but he produced the<br />\nfinished product in a little more than a<br />\nyear. Even more rotoscoping was used,<br />\nand it looked even worse. Bakshi introduced a new technique which he termed<br />\n\"Living Animation,\" meaning he copied<br />\nthe motions of live actors for the animated figures. Lord of the Rings was<br />\norginally shot completely in live action<br />\nand then \"animated.\" The concept had<br />\nbeen used previously (e.g., Satan in the<br />\n\"Night on Bald Mountain\" sequence of<br />\nFantasia was'modeled for Disney studios<br />\nby Bela Lugosi), but Lord of the Rings<br />\nwas made without the meticulousness of<br />\nDisney Studios. In addition to its sloppiness, the animated characters looked silly<br />\nagainst the background of live figures<br />\nthinly veiled by a bit of blurring and<br />\ntinting. In his latest attempt, American<br />\nPop, Bakshi is as commercial and tacky<br />\nas ever.<br /><br />\nIn any animated film, the focus is<br />\ninevitably placed upon the technical<br />\naspect, the animation itself. One can<br />\nmake a good science fiction film without<br />\nresorting to flashy special effects by<br />\nJohn Dystra (e.g., The Day the Earth<br />\nStood Still); one can make a good horror<br />\nfilm without depending upon a large<br />\nmake-up budget to make the monstrous<br />\nelement truly horrific (e.g., The Cat<br />\nPeople); one can make a good war film<br />\nwithout thousands of extras, colossal<br />\nexplosions, or convincing war machines<br />\n(e.g., Battleship Potemkin). In any other<br />\ntype of film the technical craft is merely<br />\nicing on the cake, gimmickry which<br />\naugments the film but does not serve as<br />\nits foundation. An animated film is a<br />\ndifferent case; the animation creates the<br /><br />\ncharacters, the action, the camera angles,<br />\nand the lighting, so the artistic success of<br />\nthe film depends completely upon the<br />\nanimation. American Pop is a dismal<br />\nfailure for this reason.<br />\nOnce again, Living Animation is a<br />\nsloppy copy of the actions of real actors.<br />\nThe characters' outlines are sketchy and<br />\nill-defined--a person moves his head, and<br />\nhis nose disappears. During the opening<br />\ncredits, Bakshi entices us with marvellous<br />\nsurrealistic paintings depicting the evolution of American popular music, but as<br />\nsoon as the credits disappear, so does the<br />\nlively caricature which these drawings<br />\nAlthough they occasionally<br />\npromise.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n#4*.,<br /><br />\nor, *<br /><br />\n\\<br /><br />\n'II<br />\n. Balcshi shlockifies an intriguing idea to death in American Pop.<br /><br />\nappear as background paintings, Bakshi<br />\ndoes nothing of equivalent creativity with<br />\nthe animated characters. Indeed, one<br />\nmay wonder why American Pop is<br />\nanimated at all. Bakshi never exploits the<br />\nwild, magical opportunities afforded by<br />\nanimation--his figures are such one-to-one<br />\nreplications of their live-action counterparts that they are rendered dull and<br />\npointless. The impossible in the average<br />\nBugs Bunny cartoon by Chuck Jones is<br />\nfar more interesting and entertaining than<br />\nwhat Bakshi has to offer us. What we<br />\nhope for is a wild flight into fantasy;<br />\nwhat is delivered is a crude copy of a<br />\nphotograph, nothing more.<br />\nAmerican Pop could have been<br />\nsaved from its mad plunges into mediocrity by its story, but here it fails again.<br />\nBoth Wizards and Lord of the Rings had<br />\nlimited appeal to movie audiences, but<br />\nthe subject matter of American Pop<br />\nreaches out to everyone. The movie is<br />\nabout four generations of musicians: a<br />\nvaudevillian who loses in a mob war the<br />\nwoman he loves and made a singing star;<br />\na brilliant jazz pianist who loses his live in<br />\nWorld War II; a Dylanesque songwriter of<br />\nthe 60's who allows his drug habit to<br />\ndestroy his career; and the final incarnation of the family, a snappy coke dealer<br />\nturned New Wave superstar. Unfortunately, the epic sweep of time and culture<br />\nlacks any concatenation; Bakshi's jumping from one era of American popular<br />\ncont. on p. 16<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 / APRIL 3, 1981<br /><br />\nAt The Mechanic<br /><br />\nTwo Hours Of Fosse's Frenzied Choreography<br />\nBY DAVID M. EINOLF<br />\nDuring its three-year run on<br />\nBroadway, critics have acclaimed Dancin'<br />\nas a \"celebration of the art.\" The Bob<br />\nFosse production, which runs at the<br />\nMechanic Theatre through April 18, is<br />\nless a celebration of the art of dancing<br />\nthan a celebration of Fosse's work.<br />\nWarned at the outset that the production<br />\nwill contain \"no drama,\" just \"dancin',<br />\ndancin', dancin',\" the viewer is still<br />\nunprepared for what ensues. The musical<br />\nruns less than two hours and is broken<br />\ninto three acts. The action on stage never<br />\nstops, save for the intermissions. The<br />\neighteen members of the company<br />\ndance furiously when on stage, blending<br />\nFosse's curious fascination for avantgarde dance with traditional styles.<br />\nIn Dancin', Fosse conglomerates<br />\nall of his aspirations and ideas, transferring his dreams into the bodies of the<br />\ncompany and deriving a vicarious pleasure<br />\nfrom the result. Indeed he seems to<br />\nbe asking that the audience do the same<br />\nthing, structuring the performances to<br />\nbuild towards a frenzied climax as the<br />\nfinal curtain falls. The \"Opening\" mimics<br />\nFosse's techniques in All That Jazz:<br />\ndancers are arrayed, in practice garb,<br />\nalbeit multi-colored for show. The<br />\nfrenzied and sensual act which follows<br />\nhas no set pattern.<br />\nThe next number, Fosse's \"Recollections of an Old Dancer,\" is set to Jerry<br />\nJeff Walker's \"Mr. Bojangles.\" Bojangles<br />\nis personified as an aging minstrel dancer<br />\nwhose youthful spirit floats by in the rear<br />\nand controls the aged body's actions.<br /><br />\nLess a celebration of the art of dancing than of Fosse's work.<br />\nThe next, \"Percussion,\" illustrat- who is having a horrid week, everything<br />\nes Fosse's predilection for rapid, staccato is going along well for him. He's got the<br />\nmovements and hard, sensual dance. \"feeling-too-good-today blues.\" Fosse<br />\nAccompanied by an array of percussive uses Cat Stevens' \"Was A Dog A Doughinstruments, the company displays talent nut\" to underline a Dancin'first, a dance<br />\nin adapting themselves to Fosse's improvi- with no foot movement.

Brown, Jr. called \"A Manic swing, first with the company and then<br />\nDepressive's Lament.\" Brown taps his with solo parts, both for the dancers and<br />\nway into our hearts as a manic-depressive the musicians. Outstanding among the<br /><br />\nsolo performances is that of Peggy Parten,<br />\nwhose portrayal of a long-legged beauty<br />\nin the trumpet solo leaves the viewer<br />\nbreathless.<br />\nThe company returns for a finale<br />\ntitled \"America,\" which in the context of<br />\nthe play's opening date (after the Bicentennial) is indeed impressive, though<br />\nsome of the choreography is weak.<br />\nAs indicated before, Dancin' is<br />\njust less than two hours long, and it leaves<br />\nyou wanting more. The celebration of<br />\nBob Fosse's art is wonderful if a bit<br />\nself-serving.
