She says she was told,<br />\nby the program head, Dr. Kay<br />\nPartridge, that upon completion<br />\nof the two-year intensive course<br />\nShe would be certified as a nurse<br />\npractioner, an occupation which<br />\ninsures wide latitude of<br />\napplicability in the health<br />\nprofessions.<br />\nNow all that has changed. This<br />\npast December she learned, along<br />\nWith the 31 other members of<br />\nher class, that she would not be<br />\ncertified as a nurse practioner,<br />\nbut upon graduation would<br />\nmerely be able to take the state<br />\nnursing boards along with nursing<br />\ngraduates at a host of other<br />\nnursing schools. Bickham says<br />\nthat the tuition she paid to<br />\nHopkins would have been worth<br />\nit if she had been preparing for<br />\nWhat she had thought; but<br />\nBuckham feels that she could<br />\nhave acquired similar instruction<br />\nat the University of Maryland,<br />\nWhere she was originally enrolled,<br />\nand could have attended for a<br />\nsubstantially lesser fee.<br />\nBickham's situation is<br />\napparently not unique in the new<br />\nProgram. Students are quick to<br />\ntalk about the many injustices<br />\nWhich they contend have marked<br />\nthe program since its beginning in<br />\nthe fall of 1975.<br />\n<br />\nDesigned to have the first class<br />\ngraduate this June, the program<br />\nwas intended to offer an exciting<br />\nnew dimension to nursing<br />\neducation, which would<br />\nchallenge highly-qualified<br />\nstudents with a critical approach<br />\nto clinical experience and new<br />\ndepth of inquiry. Now students, to<br />\nand even some faculty, indicate<br />\nthat the results have not \u2022<br />\napproached that vision.<br />\nStephanie Talbot, a<br />\nsecond-year student in the<br />\nprogram, has become so<br />\ndisenchanted with the Hopkins<br />\napproach to nursing education<br />\nthat she has changed her mind<br />\nabout becoming a nurse. She<br />\nexpressed her complete<br />\ndisatisfaction with the course of<br />\nstudy offered: \"This is not at all<br />\nwhat I thought it would be. I<br />\nexpected much more of a<br />\npractitioner's component in the<br />\neducation.\"<br />\nTogether with all of the other<br />\nstudents interviewed, she is<br />\napprehensive as to the viability of<br />\nthe diploma she will receive in<br />\nJune. As students explain, the<br />\nschool's program is not even<br />\naccredited by the proper<br />\nauthority.<br />\nThe students are willing to<br />\nunderstand the program's lack of<br />\naccredidation, as they realize that<br />\nno program can receive full<br />\nprofessional acceptance until the<br />\nfirst class graduates. They accept<br />\nthis even though the majority of<br />\nthem say they were not informed<br />\n<br />\nsee page<br />\n<br />\nE 11\u00b0PkINS<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nvol. lxxxi, no. 23/ tuesday, november 23, 1976/baltiniore/81st year<br />\nof this fact prior to entrance.<br />\nHowever, there are certain<br />\naspects of the program which<br />\nthey have not been able to<br />\naccept: facets which have<br />\nseemingly produced a blatant<br />\nanimosity between faculty<br />\nmembers (of which there are as<br />\nmany as students) and<br />\nthemselves. As Tricia Miller,<br />\nanother second-year student,<br />\nexplains, \"We're allowed to<br />\nbitch, and we bitch.\" The<br />\ncomplaints which the students<br />\nhave center around four key<br />\nareas: the lack of quality faculty,<br />\nan insufficiently developed<br />\ncurriculum', the absence of<br />\nchallenging intellectual<br />\nopportunities, and doubts<br />\nregarding forthcoming<br />\naccreditation.<br />\n<br />\nEthics board amends honor code<br />\nBy GAYLE COHEN<br />\nProfessors can now deal<br />\ndirectly with students who admit<br />\nto cheating in their courses,<br />\naccording to a new by-law of the<br />\nEthics Board.<br />\nUntil By-law 9 was passed last<br />\nweek all such cases where<br />\nstudents confessed their guilt<br />\nOfficially came under the<br />\nJurisdiction of the Ethics Board.<br />\nUnder the new rule, however,<br />\nthe faculty member and the<br />\nstudent can resolve the incident<br />\nIn private without the necessity<br />\nof a trial before the Board. Last<br />\nYear, the board allowed<br />\nProfessors tacit authority for<br />\ndisciplinary measures. Chairman<br />\nJere Thompson stressed,\"By-law<br />\n9 only applies when the student<br />\nconfesses.\" He explained that<br />\nalthough in the past the Board<br />\noften refrained from interfering<br />\nin such cases, the new rule gives<br />\nfull authority to professors to<br />\nmake their own decision.<br />\nIn cases where confessions are<br />\nnot involved, the procedure<br />\nremains the same as that of last<br />\nYear. After having formal charges<br />\nbrought against him by the<br />\nprofessor, the accused student<br />\nfaces a hearing of two faculty<br />\nmembers and three students.<br />\nThese judges are selected at<br />\nrandom, usually from among<br />\nmembers of the Ethics Board.<br />\nThe board consists of four<br />\nfaculty members chosen by the<br />\nAcademic Council and six<br />\n,students chosen by the Student<br />\n<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nIf the panel finds the student<br />\nguilty, it can impose any of a<br />\nwide range of penalties. These<br />\ninclude redoing the test or paper,<br />\nreceiving a score of zero, failing<br />\nthe course, suspension and<br />\nexpulsion. However, if the<br />\nstudent confesses, no entry of<br />\nrefractions is made on the<br />\nstudent's transcript.<br />\n\"Often the impact of the<br />\nhearing is punishment enough,\"<br />\nsaid Thompson. But usually it<br />\n(the hearing ) is somewhat<br />\nrehabilitating. I'm fairly liberal.<br />\nBasically I believe that people<br />\nwho cheat have problems.\"<br />\nA student can appeal his<br />\nconviction to the Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies (Sigmund R. Suskind).<br />\nThompson added the Dean<br />\ncannot intervene during the trial<br />\nperiod. The Ethics Board is<br />\n\"fairly sovereign in that area<br />\n(trials). Dean Suskind doesn't<br />\ndeal with any case until we've<br />\nfinished with it. \"<br />\nThe Board also enjoys a<br />\nsizeable degree of cooperation<br />\nfrom the faculty. Nevertheless,<br />\nThompson cited instances where<br />\nprofessors preferred to handle<br />\nmatters personally rather than to<br />\nwork through the Board. Rather<br />\nthan undergoing time-consuming<br />\ntrial proceedings,some professors<br />\nopt for flunking the guilty<br />\nstudent. Thus, Thompson hopes<br />\nthat the Board's Constitution can<br />\nbe amended to allow students to<br />\n<br />\ninitiate cheating charges when<br />\nprofessors refuse.<br />\n\"I think that cheating must be<br />\nreported. Students can complain,<br />\nbut they have to be willing to do<br />\nsomething about it.\"<br />\nThe Board is also trying to<br />\nreduce opportunities to cheat.<br />\nThompson said, \"We've written<br />\nletters to encourage faculty<br />\nmembers to behave in manners<br />\nwhich don't aid cheating.\" For<br />\nexample, instructors should not<br />\nleave examination rooms<br />\nunproctored and science<br />\nprofessors should explain the<br />\ndistinction between allowed<br />\ncollaboration on lab reports and<br />\ncheating, he said.<br />\nPast Honor<br />\nThe Ethics Board was<br />\ninstituted in the spring of 1975<br />\nwhen the Honor System was<br />\ndropped. An Honor Commission<br />\nsurvey of students provided<br />\nevidence two years ago of<br />\nwidespread student cheating,<br />\nleading to the creation of the<br />\nEthics Board. Since that time,<br />\nthe .Boardl has written its<br />\nConstitution, handled cases, and<br />\nhelped to update files of old<br />\nexams at the library.<br />\nCurrent Board members are:<br />\nfaculty\u2014John Gryder, chemistry;<br />\nA.J.R. Russell-Wood, history,<br />\nMichael Hooker, philosophy; and<br />\nCharles Westgate, electrical<br />\nengineering; and students\u2014Jere<br />\nThompson, Keith Aaronson,<br />\nLarry Press, Lawrence Kessner,<br />\nJames Fishbein, and Neal Pfizer.<br />\n<br />\nTricia Miller, a second-year<br />\nstudent, suggests that the<br />\nproblems stem from a loss of<br />\ntrust between faculty and<br />\nstudents. She says the first<br />\nentrants into the program came<br />\nwith high hopes based upon a<br />\n\"lot of promises\" from the<br />\nadministrators, and that so far<br />\nnone of these claims have turned<br />\nout to be true. Dr. Partridge<br />\ndisagrees, offering,\"No promises<br />\nwere made to students before<br />\nthey began the program.\" She<br />\nsays that even at this late<br />\njuncture, the faculty and<br />\nadministration have not decided<br />\non what the objectives of the<br />\nprogram should be.<br />\nMiller adds: \"This is the reason<br />\nwhy many of the faculty have<br />\nleft. The goals are not defined<br />\nand it's hard to set up the<br />\ncurriculum when you don't know<br />\nwhat the goals are. The best<br />\nteachers have left\"<br />\nSingle Nuns<br />\nTen faculty have departed<br />\nsince the program began. One<br />\nstudent admitted that that<br />\nadverse student sentiment<br />\nregarding two of these members<br />\ncaused them to leave; and<br />\nstudents maintain that the<br />\nfaculty hired as replacements<br />\nhave turned out to be less than<br />\nideal. Stephanie Talbot disclosed<br />\nher observation, corroborated by<br />\nthe other students interviewed,<br />\nthat a new faculty member<br />\napparently must be single and<br />\nCatholic to be considered for<br />\nappointment. Dr. Partridge<br />\ndenies it. The students say that a<br />\nsizeable portion of the faculty<br />\ncomes from Catholic University<br />\nand that many are nuns. Says<br />\nTalbot: \"I think I'm at a<br />\nparochial school. There's so<br />\nmuch discipline.\"<br />\nThe problems with the<br />\ncurriculum were not helped by<br />\nthe departure of an<br />\nadministration curriculum<br />\ncoordinator hired in May. That<br />\nemployee lasted three months<br />\nbefore resigning and her<br />\nsuccessor, hired in September by<br />\nthe School of Health Services,<br />\nSister Mary Louise Nash, has<br />\n\"not panned out\" according to<br />\nseveral sources.<br />\nIn an apparent attempt to iron<br />\nout some of the difficulties, a<br />\nseries of monthly meetings are<br />\nnow held between students and<br />\nfaculty. But rather than alleviate<br />\nthe problem, many students say<br />\nthat these discussions have<br />\n<br />\ndiminished even further the lack<br />\nof communication.<br />\n\"There is a lot of<br />\ndisorganization at the meetings.<br />\nThis produces stress with the<br />\nfaculty,\" says Willa Bickhani.<br />\nIt appears that the faculty are<br />\nalso dissatisfied with what is<br />\ngoing on in the nursing education<br />\nprogram. Several students<br />\ncontend that the faculty is very<br />\ndivided in their support of the<br />\npresent leadership offered by the<br />\nprogram's administration, and<br />\nthey indicated that much<br />\ninfighting is going on.<br />\nIt is not easy to gauge<br />\nsentiment when faculty, such as<br />\nLois Wikoff, who students refer<br />\nto as \"the colonel,\" reply to a<br />\nreporter's questions by stating:<br />\n\"No, I'm not expressing an<br />\nopinion on this. How did you get<br />\nmy name? I'm interested in<br />\nknowing.\"<br />\nPartridge dismisses most of the<br />\nstudent criticism and has<br />\ndifferent opinions about the<br />\ncauses of the present situation.<br />\n\"We are working to correct the<br />\nproblems. We try to allow for<br />\nindividuality in the curriculum.\"<br />\nDr. Partridge states that while<br />\nsome students are unhappy in the<br />\nnursing program, \"This is not<br />\nunusual in an academic<br />\ninstitution. No one expects 100<br />\nper cent happiness.\"<br />\nShe feels that students are<br />\nunder pressure and that this is'<br />\nthe reason for the hard 'feelings<br />\nbetween them and faculty.<br />\n\"Many students are worried that<br />\nthey won't be able to perform<br />\nadequately when they leave here.<br />\nMore are not unhappy.\" She<br />\nadds, \"I believe that the goals are<br />\nclear, though not static.\"<br />\nThe Future<br />\nthe program's future,<br />\nto<br />\nAs<br />\nsome students agree that progress<br />\nis being made and that in a<br />\ncouple of years the program's<br />\nflaws will be worked out.<br />\nHowever others, like Willa<br />\nBickham, feel that unless some<br />\nwholesale change is made in the<br />\nadministration of the program,<br />\nthings will likely get worse. She<br />\ncriticizes Partridge's<br />\nleadershilfabilities, stating, \"She<br />\nis a wonderful administrator and<br />\ncan get through the paperwork.<br />\nBut she is very authoritarian. She<br />\nannounces decisions and they are<br />\nnot open to discussion. She has<br />\nno contact with her supervisor.<br />\nAnd she has alienated the<br />\nprogram from the rest of the<br />\nUniversity.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/november 23, 1976<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nGreat Disappointments, No. 247: No one was able to solve<br />\nthe puzzle( Npws-Letter, 11-19)!<br />\nThe answers were: Die Walkure completed Wagner's Der<br />\nRing Des Nibelungen; Arnold Schonberg completed the New<br />\nSchool of Vienna; Z bot Sims completed Woody Herman's<br />\nFour<br />\nthers; Imre Poganyi completed the original<br />\nBudapest String Quartet.<br />\nRobert Southey completed the Panisocracy, or Lake Poets;<br />\nPorthos completed the Three Musketeers; The Big Money<br />\ncompleted John Dos Passos' USA Trilogy; East Coker<br />\ncompleted T.S.

BY GEORGE ZELINSKY<br />\nThe University has established<br />\na set of comprehensive guidelines<br />\ndealing with student access to<br />\nconfidential records, placing<br />\nthem in compliance with the<br />\nFamily Educational Rights and<br />\nPrivacy Act of 1974.<br />\nHopkins Registrar Robert E.<br />\nCyphers explained that the<br />\nguidelines were in compliance<br />\nWith the so-called Buckley<br />\nAmendment, which had as its<br />\nPurpose the protection of<br />\nstudent and parent privacy with<br />\nrespect to academic and financial<br />\nrecords held by educational<br />\ninstitutions. \"There is really no<br />\nSignificant change in Hopkins'<br />\nPolicy on student records,\"<br />\nCyphers said. \"Unlike some other<br />\nschools, we have always had a<br />\nClearly defined policy relating to<br />\nthe disclosure of student<br />\nrecords.\" Students at Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nhave had free access to their<br />\ndossiers, with the exception of<br />\nletters of recommendation<br />\nreceived by the University with<br />\nassurances of confidentiality.<br />\nAlso, student records are not<br />\nreleased outside the University<br />\ndivisions without specific written<br />\nauthorization from the student,<br />\nhe added.<br />\nThe Past<br />\nCyphers noted that there \"was<br />\ngenuine effort made to simplify<br />\nthis business\" on the part of the<br />\nDepartment of Health, Education<br />\nand Welfare (HEW), the Federae,<br />\noversight agency. He noted that<br />\nprevious sets of regulations were<br />\noften ambiguous and inadequate.<br />\nUnder the leadership of HEW<br />\nSecretary David Matthews, the<br />\nrules were revised and clarified,<br />\nand last summer a new and<br />\ndefinitivecode was instituted. An<br />\n<br />\nAction is fast and furious at registrar's office<br />\n<br />\nimportant new provision of those<br />\nregulation calls for annual<br />\nnotification of students of the<br />\nrules governing their access to<br />\nand control over their personal<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThe Registrar pointed out that<br />\nprior to the Buckley Amendment<br />\nof 1974, he had only received<br />\ntwo requests from students<br />\n<br />\nasking to examine their folders.<br />\nHowever, the widespread<br />\npublicity accompanying the<br />\nBuckley proposal precipitated 46<br />\nrequests for record examinations,<br />\nsince 1974.<br />\nCyphers noted that the<br />\nUniversity's policy of strictly<br />\ncontrolling student record<br />\ndisclosures has had an<br />\n<br />\nunexpected side benefit:<br />\ndiminished grade fraud. Cyphers<br />\nexplained that in the past it was<br />\nmuch easier for a poor student to<br />\nobtain the transcript of another,<br />\nmore successful student, and<br />\nalter it for his own purposes.<br />\nStringent disclosure regulations<br />\nmake this sort of fraud more<br />\ndifficult to perpetrate.<br />\n<br />\nNew Bologna experience enjoys measure of success<br />\nBy MICHEL STEVEN KRUG<br />\nSince 1975, Hopkins students<br />\nhave been able to pursue<br />\ninternational studies in a<br />\nEuropean setting. Qualified<br />\njuniors and seniors with an<br />\ninterest in political science,<br />\neconomics and international<br />\nrelations spend a year at the<br />\nBologna Center of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University in Bolgna,<br />\nItaly, The program has met with<br />\nmoderate success to date.<br />\n<br />\nCourses emphasize European<br />\neconomic and political<br />\norganizations and problems and<br />\nare not offered on the<br />\nHomewood campus, said<br />\nSigmund R. Suskind, Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate<br />\nstudies. Students take a<br />\nminimum of four classes, in<br />\naddition to a mandatory<br />\nintensive course in Italian, graded<br />\non a pass/fail basis. Two courses<br />\nare equivalent to intermediate<br />\n<br />\ncourses here (300 level), while<br />\nthe others are graduate courses<br />\n(600 level). All courses are taught<br />\nin English, although<br />\napproximately one half of each<br />\nclass is made up of Europeans.<br />\nSample classes: Contemporary<br />\nItalian Politics; the U.S. and<br />\nEurope; and Economic Interests<br />\nin Europe.<br />\nIn addition, special programs<br />\nare offered during intersession.<br />\nOne of the six Hopkins students<br />\n<br />\nIntersession referendum slated<br />\nBy MICHELE DAVIS<br />\nFrom December 1 through<br />\nDecember 3, the Student Council<br />\nWill hold a<br />\nreferendum<br />\nconcerning the state of<br />\nIntersession. The decision to hold<br />\nthe referendum was voted on by<br />\nthe Student Council on<br />\nNovember 17 and was passed by<br />\nan overwhelming majority.<br />\nThe referendum calls on<br />\nstudents to vote on a proposal to<br />\nrestructure the Intersession<br />\nSystem. This re-structuring is seen<br />\nas an answer to increasing apathy<br />\non the part of students and<br />\nfaculty towards Intersession. The<br />\nStudent Council feels that<br />\nrequiring each department to<br />\nOffer a minimum number of<br />\ncourses for Intersession will<br />\nincrease the diversity of the<br />\nProgram and give students a<br />\nWider range of courses to select<br />\nfrom.<br />\nSpecifically, the referendum<br />\nProposes that: 1) each<br />\ndepartment be required to offer<br />\nsin, the<br />\ncourses for Intei<br />\nnumber to be determii,ed by the<br />\n'Academic_ . Council. and; 2) if<br />\nenrollment is minimal in a<br />\nit will be<br />\ncourse, then<br />\neliminated.<br />\nThe proposal to establish a<br />\nmandatory number of courses<br />\nresults from the belief that<br />\nstudents should not have to beg<br />\nfor courses which has been the<br />\n<br />\nconcentrated in a small number<br />\nof departments, with less than<br />\nhalf of the departments a<br />\nHopkins,offering courses.<br />\nCathy Michaelson, chairman of<br />\nthe Student Council ducation<br />\nCommittee, asserted that the<br />\n\"undergraduates seem to be the<br />\nlast priority\" at Hopkins. Among<br />\nthe excuses given for the scarcity<br />\nof courses in some departments<br />\nwas a professors' preference to<br />\ndo research, and a feeling that<br />\nteaching an Intersession course<br />\nwould interfere with preparation<br />\nfor second semester.<br />\nAndy Davis, Student Assistant<br />\nto the Dean, pointed but that the<br />\nproposed Intersession would not<br />\n, place a burden on any particular<br />\nfaculty member, as the<br />\nresponsibility for course offerings<br />\ncould be rotated within<br />\ndepartments. Also, the additional<br />\nparticipation of graduate<br />\nstudents might be feasible in<br />\nsome instances.<br />\nShould the Intersession<br />\nproposal be passed, it will then<br />\nDespite a major effort on the be resubmitted to the Academic<br />\npart of Student Council to Council.<br />\nThe new format will go into<br />\nupgrade course offerings for the<br />\nupcoming Intersession, response effect the following school year,<br />\non the part of various contingent on the approval of the<br />\ndepartments has been meager.

Student<br />\nThis Intersession, 68 courses will 'Council has stated that, if the<br />\nbe offered (representing an: proposal fails, the abolishment<br />\nincrease from last Intersession). of Intersession will have to be<br />\nHowever, the courses offered are seriously cdnsidered.<br />\n<br />\nimproved Intersession, with more<br />\ncourses and greater diversity will<br />\nhopefully rekindle student<br />\ninterest and response, which<br />\nshould, in turn, generate faculty<br />\ninterest in teaching. By<br />\nstipulating a minimal enrollment<br />\nrequirement, the Student Council<br />\nplaces responsibility on the<br />\nstudents ,to make Intersession a<br />\nsuccess.<br />\n<br />\nwho attended last year's Bologna<br />\nsession, Carol Trimble, said she<br />\ntravelled to Brussels during the<br />\nwinter term for a week of<br />\nmeetings, lectures, and talks at<br />\nthe offices of the North Atlantic<br />\nTreaty Organization (NATO).<br />\nWhile Hopkins adminstrators<br />\nare basically satisfied with the<br />\nprogram, many have, expressed<br />\nhope that more students will<br />\napply for the program in the<br />\nfuture, in order to upgrade the<br />\nquality of selectees. They<br />\ncontend that an information<br />\nvacuum has caused the relatively<br />\nsparse amount of applications<br />\nand that flaws in the program are<br />\nnot the cause.<br />\nBoth Trimble and David<br />\nMenken, program veterans, said<br />\nthe program was academically<br />\nprofitable, culturally enriching,<br />\nand exciting. Their only<br />\ncomplaints concerned<br />\nadministrative problems, such as<br />\ngrade changes and credit<br />\nentrances onto transcripts. Asked<br />\nabout these difficulties, ,Suskind<br />\nresponded it was \"largely because<br />\nit was a new program\" and that it<br />\nwas difficult to coordinate<br />\nadministrative -efforts \"on the<br />\nspot\" across the Atlantic.<br />\nHowever, Suskind said he<br />\nappointed Dr. Douglass Wertman<br />\nas faculty advisor when he visited<br />\nBologna in mid-October, to solve<br />\nfuture problems encountered by<br />\nBologna students.<br />\nBologna, in northern Italy, is<br />\ngoverned by the _Italian<br />\nCommunist party. \" It is the<br />\nCommunist showcase in Italy. If<br />\nCommunism is represented by<br />\nBologna, then it's fantastic,\" said<br />\nSuskind.. The opportunity to<br />\ndiscuss the merits of the Italian<br />\nCommunist system with Italians,<br />\npro or con,is a major asset of the<br />\nmogram, he added. Italians are<br />\nalso interested to hear how<br />\nAmericans feel about a potential<br />\nCommunist national government,<br />\nvhich could cause upheaval in<br />\nNATO.<br />\nHowever, the city government<br />\n<br />\nof Bologna does a good job in<br />\nkeeping the city clean, providing<br />\nreliable transportation, and<br />\npreserving the historical flavor of<br />\nthe city. Also, because Bologna is<br />\nan agricultural center, the crime<br />\nrate is low and unemployment is<br />\nlower than the distressingly high<br />\nnational average(about ten per<br />\ncent), said Menken.<br />\nStudents are chosen for the<br />\nprogram based on their<br />\nbackgrounds in economics and<br />\npolitical science and their<br />\nseniority. Applicants must<br />\nreceive favorable<br />\nrecommendations from their<br />\nfaculty advisors, although<br />\napplicants need not be<br />\ninternational studies majors.<br />\nJuniors are preferred, but a small<br />\nnumber of seniors are also<br />\nselected.<br />\nAccording to students from<br />\nlast year's program, work loads<br />\nare moderately heavy, while<br />\ncourses are somewhat more<br />\n\"advanced\" than undergraduate<br />\ncourses at Hopkins. Grading<br />\nmethods are said to be fair. \"Yoti<br />\nhave to do the work. PeoRle<br />\nshouldn't go over there just<br />\nexpecting to tour around,\" said<br />\nTrimble. Students are graded on<br />\nthe graduate scale, from A+ to C.<br />\nThese grades are then<br />\ntransformed into the normal A to<br />\nF format.<br />\nTuition for the program is<br />\nequal to that charged other<br />\nundergraduates. Housing,<br />\nhowever, must be arranged for<br />\nand paid by students. There are<br />\nno student dormitories.

While the manner in<br />\nwhich this is done depends on<br />\nthe individual professor, we<br />\nshould like to bring your<br />\nattention to the following points<br />\nwhich have caused concern:<br />\n1. Explain to your students<br />\nyour position on the matter of<br />\nacademic integrity and how its<br />\npreservation is essential for<br />\nundergraduate, faculty member,<br />\nand the good name of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n2. Encourage students, who<br />\nhave not received or have lost<br />\ntheir copies of the Constitution,<br />\nto obtain new copies and to keep<br />\nabreast of announcements in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\n3. Emphasize that the Board<br />\nhas neither a censorial nor<br />\ninquisitorial role. It is intended<br />\nto play a positive role in<br />\nprotecting students and members<br />\nof the university from acts<br />\ncalculated to undermine the<br />\nmutual trust and respect essential<br />\nto an academic community and<br />\nin an increasingly competitive<br />\nsociety.<br />\n4. In furthering the<br />\nimplementation of the<br />\nConstitution it would be of great<br />\nassistance to students if<br />\nprofessors clearly laid down<br />\n'ground rules' at the first lecture<br />\nor laboratory of term, e.g.<br />\nprerequisites for courses,<br />\nexamination requirements,<br />\nlaboratory schedules. Then is the<br />\ntime for the professor to clearly<br />\nindicate his grading procedures,<br />\nhis expectations from students,<br />\nand the degree of leeway (if any)<br />\nin the meeting of deadlines.<br />\nExperience has shown that<br />\ndoubts as to some of these simple<br />\nissues can lead students to<br />\n'become flustered and commit<br />\nacts of which they would not<br />\nnormally be capable and whose<br />\nrepercussions may be severe.<br />\n5.

The real figure's<br />\nprobably somewhat over one<br />\n<br />\nthan its share of shady operators<br />\nand slick artists, with a too-often<br />\ndeserved cloudy reputation.<br />\n\"Rely on professionals not<br />\ngimmicks!\" reads the ad for<br />\nFootball Forecasting Associates.<br />\nThe pages of football and sports<br />\nmagazines are rife with<br />\ncompeting outfits, many claiming<br />\nsecret formulas or unbeatable<br />\ncomputers, Send in from ten to<br />\nfive hundred dollars to Huey,<br />\nDoc, Russ \"The Swede\" Berg,<br />\nMs. Terry (\"America's only<br />\nall-female sports forecasting<br />\nservice\"), or any other<br />\ninformation service; in return,<br />\nreceive a combination of<br />\nnewsletters,. phone arrangements,<br />\nRed Sheets, Green Sheets,<br />\nhotlines, and mini-calculator<br />\ndevices.<br />\nAndrade, after observing the<br />\nfootball prediction business for a<br />\nwhile, set up Football<br />\nForecasting this year, intent on<br />\nholding as close as possible to a<br />\nstrict professional style.<br />\n<br />\nlegalization of gambling to give<br />\nan immense boost to his service.<br />\n\"The U.S. is the only major<br />\ncountry that considers gambling<br />\na moral, not a business issue. The<br />\ngovernment has realized it can't<br />\ncontrol sports gambling -bookies will always exist. They<br />\nserve a basic function... The cities<br />\non the Eastern seaboard are in<br />\ndesperate need of an attraction<br />\nto revitalize themselves. I think<br />\nopposition from people on moral<br />\ngrounds, from the churches, the<br />\nscares about mob influence, will<br />\ngive way to financial<br />\nconsiderations...the cities are<br />\nfaced with going broke or using<br />\nsomething like gambling to pick<br />\nthings up.\"<br />\n<br />\nto cover the points; information<br />\nfrom one of 44 contacts Football<br />\nForecasting has throughout the<br />\ncountry, people Andrade calls<br />\n\"arrdent sports enthusiasts who'd<br />\njust as soon not be identified,\"<br />\nmeaning local tipsters or bookies<br />\nwho can give up-to-the-minute<br />\n<br />\nPredicting the legalization of<br />\ngambling in a number of states<br />\nwithin three years, Andrade<br />\nexplained that at that point \"the<br />\nstates have to either erase<br />\ncompetition or become<br />\ncompetitive on a very low level.<br />\nThe $50,000 gambler, when he<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n$<br />\n,<br />\n08<br />\n<br />\nts\u00b0<br />\n\"If you're just sending out<br />\ninformation objectively (such as<br />\na newsletter or a one-minute<br />\nrecitation of points) on an<br />\nimpersonal basis,\" Andrade said,<br />\n\"then your customers will<br />\ninterpret you impersonally. After<br />\na two-for-five weekend, they'll<br />\nwonder what happened and quit.<br />\nWith a personal approach, people<br />\nare more prone toaccept an<br />\noccasional week that's not very<br />\ngood...spending some time<br />\ntalking with them, saying what<br />\nled us to pick that particular<br />\ngame, should develop a pretty<br />\npersonal relationship, like a<br />\nconsultant service.

Weeknights are spent<br />\nnarrowing down the list of<br />\noutstanding games. To preen the<br />\nlist of selections, a number of<br />\nvariables are considered:<br />\nstatistical \"situation\", such as the<br />\nfact that a team which has won<br />\nthree games in a row against the<br />\nspread beats the spread in the<br />\nnext game 67% of the time, or<br />\nthat a visiting team favored by 7<br />\nto 91<br />\n/<br />\n2 points has a 64.7% chance<br />\n<br />\n4,idracic.<br />\n<br />\ncampaign<br />\n<br />\nTheir<br />\n<br />\nmorning calls to weather bureaus;<br />\nra6.<br />\n<br />\nVtl\u2022Ati.A.0.91.<br />\n<br />\nteamincentive,<br />\n<br />\nconsisted<br />\n<br />\nstraightforward<br />\n<br />\nIGIJUILb<br />\nand pidyci<br />\nevaluations; the weather at game<br />\nsites, obtained by Saturday<br />\n<br />\ninjury<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nof<br />\n<br />\none-page<br />\n<br />\ninsertion run in most football<br />\n<br />\nmagazines, listing the staff and<br />\nbackground notes (Bobby Boyd,<br />\nex-Colt and coach; Harry Wright,<br />\na Notre Dame All-American and<br />\npro scout; Bill Finley, a football<br />\ncoach and scout with a Math<br />\nM.S. in Statis tics), and that<br />\nimpressive BankAmericard logo.<br />\nThe Football Forecasting's rates<br />\nranked among the highest of all<br />\nthe services -- from $50<br />\nguaranteed picks of the week<br />\nthrough $100 monthly fees to a<br />\ncomplete $350 seasonal college<br />\nand pro deal -- and large fees can<br />\nintrigue an investor more than<br />\ncheap rates. Their subscribers<br />\ncome from all across the country<br />\n(Colorado, Oklahoma, New<br />\nYork, Hawaii for a few states)<br />\nand Canada.<br />\nAs for the customer's interests<br />\nbeyond the straight football<br />\ninformation, Andrade naturally<br />\nshuns getting into that kind of<br />\npersonal relationship. \"We don't<br />\nconcern ourselves about what<br />\nthey're doing with the<br />\ninformation. We sell it, and<br />\nassume they.re sports fans...our<br />\nbusiness is set up from the point<br />\nof view of just giving out sports<br />\ninformation.

As for<br />\nthe services that advertise<br />\n\"unbeatable\" picks, Finley<br />\ncommented that \"anybody<br />\nwho claims 90% against the line<br />\nfor the season is lying.

Lack of student<br />\ninterest, and the failure offaculty to offer a sufficient number of courses, has driven<br />\nIntersission to the point where many administrators view it as highly expendable.<br />\nThe Student Council Committee on Education has been involved in a desperate<br />\nattempt to squeeze more course offerings out of each academic department. These<br />\nefforts have resulted in a increase of offerings over last year. However, we contend<br />\nthat students should not have to plead for Intersession courses. Since this is the case,<br />\nIntersession must be restructured!

Thus, the<br />\nStudent Council has submitted the following proposals for rererendum by the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\n<br />\nPROPOSED:<br />\n1.)

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nPierre Fournier, France's elder<br />\nstatesman of the cello, played at<br />\nShriver Hall Sunday evening in<br />\nwhat was a highly satisfying, if<br />\noccasionally uneven display of<br />\ncello playing.<br />\nThe programmes for the<br />\nconcert carreid a quotation<br />\nwhich proclaimed Mr. Fournier,<br />\n\"The Keats of the _cello.\"<br />\nSunday's concert bore out that<br />\nappelation, in a way which was<br />\nprobably not considered when<br />\nthe remark was originally\u2022<br />\nformulated.<br />\nIt has been mentioned by<br />\nseveral English scholars that a<br />\nproblem arises in a Romantic<br />\ntradition if its artists become too<br />\nold to maintain the energies of<br />\ntheir youth. In a sense, this is the<br />\ncase with Fournier; he seems to<br />\nhave lost some of the technical<br />\nfinesse of his younger days. He<br />\nhas not, however, lost the<br />\nmusicianship which so long a<br />\ncareer brings, and the result was a<br />\nPerformance containing a level of<br />\nvirtuosity rarely achieved by<br />\nthose possessing extreme<br />\ntechnical accuracy.<br />\nTo open the concert, Fournier<br />\nand his accompanist played the<br />\nSchubert Sonata Arpeggione. The<br />\nWork, although generally classed<br />\nWith the rest of the cello<br />\nliterature, is not a cello piece at<br />\nall; it was actually written for a<br />\nnovv discarded instrument, the<br />\narpeggione.<br />\nThe arpeggione was an<br />\ninstrument related to the gamba<br />\nfamily, and was used for a time<br />\nWhen it was not clear which of<br />\nthe lower strings would remain as<br />\n<br />\nstandard. Like the gambas, the<br />\narpeggione was not to remain of<br />\nthe scene. (Those interested in<br />\nthe arpeggione should consult the<br />\nDG recording with Klaus Stork,<br />\nArchiv Produktion 2533 175,<br />\nwhich includes some<br />\ndocumentation of the<br />\ninstrument.)<br />\nThe playing was light and<br />\nquick, with a delightful wit and<br />\nclarity. But there were also some<br />\nproblems with notes played<br />\noff-pitch, especially in<br />\nthumb-position; further, some of<br />\nthe notes played with harmonics<br />\nwere not sufficiently projected.<br />\nAnd in the third movement,<br />\nthere was a phrase which was<br />\nsung, rather than played.<br />\nIn a lesser artist, such errors<br />\nwould be inexcusable. Perhaps. it.<br />\nis due to our dependence. Or<br />\norientation to the \"infillible\"<br />\nmedium of recordings, but errors<br />\nof technique are rarely tolerated.<br />\nThis was not the case.

In addition to a diverse<br />\nrhythmic content, the suites are<br />\nalso interesting because of the<br />\namount of double- and<br />\n<br />\ntriple-stopping they require (i.e.,<br />\nthe playing of two or three notes<br />\nat one time).<br />\nIf ontonation or bowing were<br />\na problem, it would be here that<br />\none would notice; Fournier<br />\nplayed the piece as if it had been<br />\nwritten for him. His sense of<br />\narchitecture, tone, and balapce<br />\nmade the piece a pure joy. With a<br />\ndark, rich tone, especially on the<br />\nB and E strings, the full<br />\nresonance of the music was<br />\nmatched only by the roar of<br />\napplause which followed. Faure's Elegie is one of any<br />\ncellist's standars, and is, usually<br />\nplayed with a broad romantic<br />\nstyle. Fournier played with a<br />\ngreat depth . of feeling, yet<br />\navoided the pitfalls of overt<br />\nromantic mannerisms. His<br />\nplaying was warm and lean,<br />\nexploiting the melodic lines<br />\nwithout taxing the textures of<br />\nthe music. The cello blended<br />\nexquisitely with Mr. Pommers<br />\nlucid accompaniment, while<br />\nretaining its identity.<br />\nSurprisingly, Fournier avoided<br />\nthe customarily wide vibrato<br />\nemployed by many French string<br />\nplayers.<br />\nThis was indeed the highlight<br />\nof the concert.<br />\nBrahms' Sonata in F Mahor,<br />\nOp. 99 was to close the program<br />\nand it was the ideal piece to show<br />\noff Fournier's abilities. Requiring<br />\nas much virtuosity as musical<br />\nsense, the Brahm's is<br />\nrhythmically, harmonically and<br />\nstructurally complex. For<br />\nFournier, however, it seemed as<br />\nnatural as an open string note.<br />\nWorking from the inside of the<br />\n<br />\nmelodic line, the phrases were<br />\nshaped with subtlety and<br />\nbalance. The sonata became a<br />\nmasterpiece of construction and<br />\ninterpretation, a true feat worthy<br />\nof the bravura playing it received.<br />\nThe audience was more than<br />\nappreciative, applauding loudly<br />\nfor several minutes. and<br />\neventually bullying Messr.<br />\n<br />\nFournier and Ponuners into an<br />\nencore, and then yet anothei<br />\nwith Fournier alone.

As Tricia Miller,<br />\nanother second-year student,<br />\nexplains, \"We're allowed to<br />\nbitch, and we bitch.\" The<br />\ncomplaints which the students<br />\nhave center around four key<br />\nareas: the lack of quality faculty,<br />\nan insufficiently developed<br />\ncurriculum', the absence of<br />\nchallenging intellectual<br />\nopportunities, and doubts<br />\nregarding forthcoming<br />\naccreditation.<br /><br />\nEthics board amends honor code<br />\nBy GAYLE COHEN<br />\nProfessors can now deal<br />\ndirectly with students who admit<br />\nto cheating in their courses,<br />\naccording to a new by-law of the<br />\nEthics Board.<br />\nUntil By-law 9 was passed last<br />\nweek all such cases where<br />\nstudents confessed their guilt<br />\nOfficially came under the<br />\nJurisdiction of the Ethics Board.<br />\nUnder the new rule, however,<br />\nthe faculty member and the<br />\nstudent can resolve the incident<br />\nIn private without the necessity<br />\nof a trial before the Board. Last<br />\nYear, the board allowed<br />\nProfessors tacit authority for<br />\ndisciplinary measures. Chairman<br />\nJere Thompson stressed,\"By-law<br />\n9 only applies when the student<br />\nconfesses.\" He explained that<br />\nalthough in the past the Board<br />\noften refrained from interfering<br />\nin such cases, the new rule gives<br />\nfull authority to professors to<br />\nmake their own decision.<br />\nIn cases where confessions are<br />\nnot involved, the procedure<br />\nremains the same as that of last<br />\nYear. After having formal charges<br />\nbrought against him by the<br />\nprofessor, the accused student<br />\nfaces a hearing of two faculty<br />\nmembers and three students.<br />\nThese judges are selected at<br />\nrandom, usually from among<br />\nmembers of the Ethics Board.<br />\nThe board consists of four<br />\nfaculty members chosen by the<br />\nAcademic Council and six<br />\n,students chosen by the Student<br /><br />\nCouncil.<br />\nIf the panel finds the student<br />\nguilty, it can impose any of a<br />\nwide range of penalties. These<br />\ninclude redoing the test or paper,<br />\nreceiving a score of zero, failing<br />\nthe course, suspension and<br />\nexpulsion. However, if the<br />\nstudent confesses, no entry of<br />\nrefractions is made on the<br />\nstudent's transcript.<br />\n\"Often the impact of the<br />\nhearing is punishment enough,\"<br />\nsaid Thompson. But usually it<br />\n(the hearing ) is somewhat<br />\nrehabilitating. I'm fairly liberal.<br />\nBasically I believe that people<br />\nwho cheat have problems.\"<br />\nA student can appeal his<br />\nconviction to the Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate<br />\nStudies (Sigmund R. Suskind).<br />\nThompson added the Dean<br />\ncannot intervene during the trial<br />\nperiod. The Ethics Board is<br />\n\"fairly sovereign in that area<br />\n(trials). Dean Suskind doesn't<br />\ndeal with any case until we've<br />\nfinished with it. \"<br />\nThe Board also enjoys a<br />\nsizeable degree of cooperation<br />\nfrom the faculty. Nevertheless,<br />\nThompson cited instances where<br />\nprofessors preferred to handle<br />\nmatters personally rather than to<br />\nwork through the Board. Rather<br />\nthan undergoing time-consuming<br />\ntrial proceedings,some professors<br />\nopt for flunking the guilty<br />\nstudent. Thus, Thompson hopes<br />\nthat the Board's Constitution can<br />\nbe amended to allow students to<br /><br />\ninitiate cheating charges when<br />\nprofessors refuse.<br />\n\"I think that cheating must be<br />\nreported. Students can complain,<br />\nbut they have to be willing to do<br />\nsomething about it.\"<br />\nThe Board is also trying to<br />\nreduce opportunities to cheat.<br />\nThompson said, \"We've written<br />\nletters to encourage faculty<br />\nmembers to behave in manners<br />\nwhich don't aid cheating.\" For<br />\nexample, instructors should not<br />\nleave examination rooms<br />\nunproctored and science<br />\nprofessors should explain the<br />\ndistinction between allowed<br />\ncollaboration on lab reports and<br />\ncheating, he said.<br />\nPast Honor<br />\nThe Ethics Board was<br />\ninstituted in the spring of 1975<br />\nwhen the Honor System was<br />\ndropped. An Honor Commission<br />\nsurvey of students provided<br />\nevidence two years ago of<br />\nwidespread student cheating,<br />\nleading to the creation of the<br />\nEthics Board.

She says the first<br />\nentrants into the program came<br />\nwith high hopes based upon a<br />\n\"lot of promises\" from the<br />\nadministrators, and that so far<br />\nnone of these claims have turned<br />\nout to be true. Dr. Partridge<br />\ndisagrees, offering,\"No promises<br />\nwere made to students before<br />\nthey began the program.\" She<br />\nsays that even at this late<br />\njuncture, the faculty and<br />\nadministration have not decided<br />\non what the objectives of the<br />\nprogram should be.<br />\nMiller adds: \"This is the reason<br />\nwhy many of the faculty have<br />\nleft. The goals are not defined<br />\nand it's hard to set up the<br />\ncurriculum when you don't know<br />\nwhat the goals are. The best<br />\nteachers have left\"<br />\nSingle Nuns<br />\nTen faculty have departed<br />\nsince the program began. One<br />\nstudent admitted that that<br />\nadverse student sentiment<br />\nregarding two of these members<br />\ncaused them to leave; and<br />\nstudents maintain that the<br />\nfaculty hired as replacements<br />\nhave turned out to be less than<br />\nideal. Stephanie Talbot disclosed<br />\nher observation, corroborated by<br />\nthe other students interviewed,<br />\nthat a new faculty member<br />\napparently must be single and<br />\nCatholic to be considered for<br />\nappointment. Dr. Partridge<br />\ndenies it. The students say that a<br />\nsizeable portion of the faculty<br />\ncomes from Catholic University<br />\nand that many are nuns. Says<br />\nTalbot: \"I think I'm at a<br />\nparochial school. There's so<br />\nmuch discipline.\"<br />\nThe problems with the<br />\ncurriculum were not helped by<br />\nthe departure of an<br />\nadministration curriculum<br />\ncoordinator hired in May. That<br />\nemployee lasted three months<br />\nbefore resigning and her<br />\nsuccessor, hired in September by<br />\nthe School of Health Services,<br />\nSister Mary Louise Nash, has<br />\n\"not panned out\" according to<br />\nseveral sources.<br />\nIn an apparent attempt to iron<br />\nout some of the difficulties, a<br />\nseries of monthly meetings are<br />\nnow held between students and<br />\nfaculty. But rather than alleviate<br />\nthe problem, many students say<br />\nthat these discussions have<br /><br />\ndiminished even further the lack<br />\nof communication.<br />\n\"There is a lot of<br />\ndisorganization at the meetings.<br />\nThis produces stress with the<br />\nfaculty,\" says Willa Bickhani.<br />\nIt appears that the faculty are<br />\nalso dissatisfied with what is<br />\ngoing on in the nursing education<br />\nprogram. Several students<br />\ncontend that the faculty is very<br />\ndivided in their support of the<br />\npresent leadership offered by the<br />\nprogram's administration, and<br />\nthey indicated that much<br />\ninfighting is going on.<br />\nIt is not easy to gauge<br />\nsentiment when faculty, such as<br />\nLois Wikoff, who students refer<br />\nto as \"the colonel,\" reply to a<br />\nreporter's questions by stating:<br />\n\"No, I'm not expressing an<br />\nopinion on this. How did you get<br />\nmy name? I'm interested in<br />\nknowing.\"<br />\nPartridge dismisses most of the<br />\nstudent criticism and has<br />\ndifferent opinions about the<br />\ncauses of the present situation.<br />\n\"We are working to correct the<br />\nproblems. We try to allow for<br />\nindividuality in the curriculum.\"<br />\nDr. Partridge states that while<br />\nsome students are unhappy in the<br />\nnursing program, \"This is not<br />\nunusual in an academic<br />\ninstitution. No one expects 100<br />\nper cent happiness.\"<br />\nShe feels that students are<br />\nunder pressure and that this is'<br />\nthe reason for the hard 'feelings<br />\nbetween them and faculty.<br />\n\"Many students are worried that<br />\nthey won't be able to perform<br />\nadequately when they leave here.<br />\nMore are not unhappy.\" She<br />\nadds, \"I believe that the goals are<br />\nclear, though not static.\"<br />\nThe Future<br />\nthe program's future,<br />\nto<br />\nAs<br />\nsome students agree that progress<br />\nis being made and that in a<br />\ncouple of years the program's<br />\nflaws will be worked out.<br />\nHowever others, like Willa<br />\nBickham, feel that unless some<br />\nwholesale change is made in the<br />\nadministration of the program,<br />\nthings will likely get worse.

BY GEORGE ZELINSKY<br />\nThe University has established<br />\na set of comprehensive guidelines<br />\ndealing with student access to<br />\nconfidential records, placing<br />\nthem in compliance with the<br />\nFamily Educational Rights and<br />\nPrivacy Act of 1974.<br />\nHopkins Registrar Robert E.<br />\nCyphers explained that the<br />\nguidelines were in compliance<br />\nWith the so-called Buckley<br />\nAmendment, which had as its<br />\nPurpose the protection of<br />\nstudent and parent privacy with<br />\nrespect to academic and financial<br />\nrecords held by educational<br />\ninstitutions. \"There is really no<br />\nSignificant change in Hopkins'<br />\nPolicy on student records,\"<br />\nCyphers said. \"Unlike some other<br />\nschools, we have always had a<br />\nClearly defined policy relating to<br />\nthe disclosure of student<br />\nrecords.\" Students at Hopkins<br /><br />\nhave had free access to their<br />\ndossiers, with the exception of<br />\nletters of recommendation<br />\nreceived by the University with<br />\nassurances of confidentiality.<br />\nAlso, student records are not<br />\nreleased outside the University<br />\ndivisions without specific written<br />\nauthorization from the student,<br />\nhe added.<br />\nThe Past<br />\nCyphers noted that there \"was<br />\ngenuine effort made to simplify<br />\nthis business\" on the part of the<br />\nDepartment of Health, Education<br />\nand Welfare (HEW), the Federae,<br />\noversight agency. He noted that<br />\nprevious sets of regulations were<br />\noften ambiguous and inadequate.<br />\nUnder the leadership of HEW<br />\nSecretary David Matthews, the<br />\nrules were revised and clarified,<br />\nand last summer a new and<br />\ndefinitivecode was instituted. An<br /><br />\nAction is fast and furious at registrar's office<br /><br />\nimportant new provision of those<br />\nregulation calls for annual<br />\nnotification of students of the<br />\nrules governing their access to<br />\nand control over their personal<br />\nrecords.<br />\nThe Registrar pointed out that<br />\nprior to the Buckley Amendment<br />\nof 1974, he had only received<br />\ntwo requests from students<br /><br />\nasking to examine their folders.<br />\nHowever, the widespread<br />\npublicity accompanying the<br />\nBuckley proposal precipitated 46<br />\nrequests for record examinations,<br />\nsince 1974.<br />\nCyphers noted that the<br />\nUniversity's policy of strictly<br />\ncontrolling student record<br />\ndisclosures has had an<br /><br />\nunexpected side benefit:<br />\ndiminished grade fraud. Cyphers<br />\nexplained that in the past it was<br />\nmuch easier for a poor student to<br />\nobtain the transcript of another,<br />\nmore successful student, and<br />\nalter it for his own purposes.<br />\nStringent disclosure regulations<br />\nmake this sort of fraud more<br />\ndifficult to perpetrate.<br /><br />\nNew Bologna experience enjoys measure of success<br />\nBy MICHEL STEVEN KRUG<br />\nSince 1975, Hopkins students<br />\nhave been able to pursue<br />\ninternational studies in a<br />\nEuropean setting. Qualified<br />\njuniors and seniors with an<br />\ninterest in political science,<br />\neconomics and international<br />\nrelations spend a year at the<br />\nBologna Center of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University in Bolgna,<br />\nItaly, The program has met with<br />\nmoderate success to date.<br /><br />\nCourses emphasize European<br />\neconomic and political<br />\norganizations and problems and<br />\nare not offered on the<br />\nHomewood campus, said<br />\nSigmund R. Suskind, Dean of<br />\nUndergraduate and Graduate<br />\nstudies. Students take a<br />\nminimum of four classes, in<br />\naddition to a mandatory<br />\nintensive course in Italian, graded<br />\non a pass/fail basis. Two courses<br />\nare equivalent to intermediate<br /><br />\ncourses here (300 level), while<br />\nthe others are graduate courses<br />\n(600 level). All courses are taught<br />\nin English, although<br />\napproximately one half of each<br />\nclass is made up of Europeans.<br />\nSample classes: Contemporary<br />\nItalian Politics; the U.S. and<br />\nEurope; and Economic Interests<br />\nin Europe.<br />\nIn addition, special programs<br />\nare offered during intersession.<br />\nOne of the six Hopkins students<br /><br />\nIntersession referendum slated<br />\nBy MICHELE DAVIS<br />\nFrom December 1 through<br />\nDecember 3, the Student Council<br />\nWill hold a<br />\nreferendum<br />\nconcerning the state of<br />\nIntersession. The decision to hold<br />\nthe referendum was voted on by<br />\nthe Student Council on<br />\nNovember 17 and was passed by<br />\nan overwhelming majority.<br />\nThe referendum calls on<br />\nstudents to vote on a proposal to<br />\nrestructure the Intersession<br />\nSystem. This re-structuring is seen<br />\nas an answer to increasing apathy<br />\non the part of students and<br />\nfaculty towards Intersession. The<br />\nStudent Council feels that<br />\nrequiring each department to<br />\nOffer a minimum number of<br />\ncourses for Intersession will<br />\nincrease the diversity of the<br />\nProgram and give students a<br />\nWider range of courses to select<br />\nfrom.<br />\nSpecifically, the referendum<br />\nProposes that: 1) each<br />\ndepartment be required to offer<br />\nsin, the<br />\ncourses for Intei<br />\nnumber to be determii,ed by the<br />\n'Academic_ . Council. and; 2) if<br />\nenrollment is minimal in a<br />\nit will be<br />\ncourse, then<br />\neliminated.<br />\nThe proposal to establish a<br />\nmandatory number of courses<br />\nresults from the belief that<br />\nstudents should not have to beg<br />\nfor courses which has been the<br /><br />\nconcentrated in a small number<br />\nof departments, with less than<br />\nhalf of the departments a<br />\nHopkins,offering courses.<br />\nCathy Michaelson, chairman of<br />\nthe Student Council ducation<br />\nCommittee, asserted that the<br />\n\"undergraduates seem to be the<br />\nlast priority\" at Hopkins. Among<br />\nthe excuses given for the scarcity<br />\nof courses in some departments<br />\nwas a professors' preference to<br />\ndo research, and a feeling that<br />\nteaching an Intersession course<br />\nwould interfere with preparation<br />\nfor second semester.<br />\nAndy Davis, Student Assistant<br />\nto the Dean, pointed but that the<br />\nproposed Intersession would not<br />\n, place a burden on any particular<br />\nfaculty member, as the<br />\nresponsibility for course offerings<br />\ncould be rotated within<br />\ndepartments. Also, the additional<br />\nparticipation of graduate<br />\nstudents might be feasible in<br />\nsome instances.<br />\nShould the Intersession<br />\nproposal be passed, it will then<br />\nDespite a major effort on the be resubmitted to the Academic<br />\npart of Student Council to Council.<br />\nThe new format will go into<br />\nupgrade course offerings for the<br />\nupcoming Intersession, response effect the following school year,<br />\non the part of various contingent on the approval of the<br />\ndepartments has been meager.

By<br />\nstipulating a minimal enrollment<br />\nrequirement, the Student Council<br />\nplaces responsibility on the<br />\nstudents ,to make Intersession a<br />\nsuccess.<br /><br />\nwho attended last year's Bologna<br />\nsession, Carol Trimble, said she<br />\ntravelled to Brussels during the<br />\nwinter term for a week of<br />\nmeetings, lectures, and talks at<br />\nthe offices of the North Atlantic<br />\nTreaty Organization (NATO).<br />\nWhile Hopkins adminstrators<br />\nare basically satisfied with the<br />\nprogram, many have, expressed<br />\nhope that more students will<br />\napply for the program in the<br />\nfuture, in order to upgrade the<br />\nquality of selectees. They<br />\ncontend that an information<br />\nvacuum has caused the relatively<br />\nsparse amount of applications<br />\nand that flaws in the program are<br />\nnot the cause.<br />\nBoth Trimble and David<br />\nMenken, program veterans, said<br />\nthe program was academically<br />\nprofitable, culturally enriching,<br />\nand exciting. Their only<br />\ncomplaints concerned<br />\nadministrative problems, such as<br />\ngrade changes and credit<br />\nentrances onto transcripts. Asked<br />\nabout these difficulties, ,Suskind<br />\nresponded it was \"largely because<br />\nit was a new program\" and that it<br />\nwas difficult to coordinate<br />\nadministrative -efforts \"on the<br />\nspot\" across the Atlantic.<br />\nHowever, Suskind said he<br />\nappointed Dr. Douglass Wertman<br />\nas faculty advisor when he visited<br />\nBologna in mid-October, to solve<br />\nfuture problems encountered by<br />\nBologna students.<br />\nBologna, in northern Italy, is<br />\ngoverned by the _Italian<br />\nCommunist party. \" It is the<br />\nCommunist showcase in Italy. If<br />\nCommunism is represented by<br />\nBologna, then it's fantastic,\" said<br />\nSuskind.. The opportunity to<br />\ndiscuss the merits of the Italian<br />\nCommunist system with Italians,<br />\npro or con,is a major asset of the<br />\nmogram, he added. Italians are<br />\nalso interested to hear how<br />\nAmericans feel about a potential<br />\nCommunist national government,<br />\nvhich could cause upheaval in<br />\nNATO.<br />\nHowever, the city government<br /><br />\nof Bologna does a good job in<br />\nkeeping the city clean, providing<br />\nreliable transportation, and<br />\npreserving the historical flavor of<br />\nthe city. Also, because Bologna is<br />\nan agricultural center, the crime<br />\nrate is low and unemployment is<br />\nlower than the distressingly high<br />\nnational average(about ten per<br />\ncent), said Menken.<br />\nStudents are chosen for the<br />\nprogram based on their<br />\nbackgrounds in economics and<br />\npolitical science and their<br />\nseniority. Applicants must<br />\nreceive favorable<br />\nrecommendations from their<br />\nfaculty advisors, although<br />\napplicants need not be<br />\ninternational studies majors.<br />\nJuniors are preferred, but a small<br />\nnumber of seniors are also<br />\nselected.<br />\nAccording to students from<br />\nlast year's program, work loads<br />\nare moderately heavy, while<br />\ncourses are somewhat more<br />\n\"advanced\" than undergraduate<br />\ncourses at Hopkins. Grading<br />\nmethods are said to be fair. \"Yoti<br />\nhave to do the work. PeoRle<br />\nshouldn't go over there just<br />\nexpecting to tour around,\" said<br />\nTrimble. Students are graded on<br />\nthe graduate scale, from A+ to C.<br />\nThese grades are then<br />\ntransformed into the normal A to<br />\nF format.<br />\nTuition for the program is<br />\nequal to that charged other<br />\nundergraduates. Housing,<br />\nhowever, must be arranged for<br />\nand paid by students. There are<br />\nno student dormitories.

While the manner in<br />\nwhich this is done depends on<br />\nthe individual professor, we<br />\nshould like to bring your<br />\nattention to the following points<br />\nwhich have caused concern:<br />\n1. Explain to your students<br />\nyour position on the matter of<br />\nacademic integrity and how its<br />\npreservation is essential for<br />\nundergraduate, faculty member,<br />\nand the good name of the<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n2. Encourage students, who<br />\nhave not received or have lost<br />\ntheir copies of the Constitution,<br />\nto obtain new copies and to keep<br />\nabreast of announcements in the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\n3. Emphasize that the Board<br />\nhas neither a censorial nor<br />\ninquisitorial role. It is intended<br />\nto play a positive role in<br />\nprotecting students and members<br />\nof the university from acts<br />\ncalculated to undermine the<br />\nmutual trust and respect essential<br />\nto an academic community and<br />\nin an increasingly competitive<br />\nsociety.<br />\n4. In furthering the<br />\nimplementation of the<br />\nConstitution it would be of great<br />\nassistance to students if<br />\nprofessors clearly laid down<br />\n'ground rules' at the first lecture<br />\nor laboratory of term, e.g.<br />\nprerequisites for courses,<br />\nexamination requirements,<br />\nlaboratory schedules. Then is the<br />\ntime for the professor to clearly<br />\nindicate his grading procedures,<br />\nhis expectations from students,<br />\nand the degree of leeway (if any)<br />\nin the meeting of deadlines.<br />\nExperience has shown that<br />\ndoubts as to some of these simple<br />\nissues can lead students to<br />\n'become flustered and commit<br />\nacts of which they would not<br />\nnormally be capable and whose<br />\nrepercussions may be severe.<br />\n5. Give to the students a<br />\nworking definition of plagiarism,<br />\nyour views of \"term paper<br />\ncompanies\", on collaborative<br />\nefforts, and on the submission of<br />\nthe same paper for more than<br />\none course, and what you<br />\nconsider to constitute cheating in<br />\nyour specific course.<br />\nJ.

Lack of student<br />\ninterest, and the failure offaculty to offer a sufficient number of courses, has driven<br />\nIntersission to the point where many administrators view it as highly expendable.<br />\nThe Student Council Committee on Education has been involved in a desperate<br />\nattempt to squeeze more course offerings out of each academic department. These<br />\nefforts have resulted in a increase of offerings over last year. However, we contend<br />\nthat students should not have to plead for Intersession courses. Since this is the case,<br />\nIntersession must be restructured! Shouta this restructuring fail, the Student Council<br />\nrealizes that the abolishment ofIntersession will have to be seriously considered.<br /><br />\n_PIET CANDLE\u00ae<br />\nFlorida's Answer to the Pet Rock.<br />\nPET CANDLE comes to you with complete set of operating instructions to<br />\ntrain your PET CANDLE to sit up,<br />\nstand, light up, and fly.<br />\nAvailable in Small, Medium, and Large Sizes.<br />\nPET CANDLE<br />\n110 Giralda Ave., Coral<br />\n$1.00 plus<br />\nE Small<br />\nE Medium $2.00 plus<br />\nE Large $3.00 plus<br /><br />\nGables, Florida 33134<br />\n50C postage &amp; handling<br />\n75e postage &amp; handling<br />\n95C postage &amp; handling<br /><br />\nName<br /><br />\nWe feel that requiring each department to offer a minimum number of courses per<br />\nIntersession would cause student response to increase.

Thus, the<br />\nStudent Council has submitted the following proposals for rererendum by the<br />\nstudent body.<br /><br />\nPROPOSED:<br />\n1.)

Led by 80-year-old<br />\ntrumpeter Kid Thomas<br />\nValentine, the septet roared<br />\nthrough two hour-long sets,<br />\nperforming such standards as<br />\nTiger Rag, St. James' Infirmary<br />\nand a marvelous rendition of<br />\nWhen the Saints Go Marching In<br />\nwhich featured Valentine's stroll<br />\nthru the audience and up into the<br />\nbalcony.<br /><br />\nMellow Cello<br /><br />\nFournier wows 'em at Shriver<br />\nBy J. D. CONSIDINE<br />\nPierre Fournier, France's elder<br />\nstatesman of the cello, played at<br />\nShriver Hall Sunday evening in<br />\nwhat was a highly satisfying, if<br />\noccasionally uneven display of<br />\ncello playing.<br />\nThe programmes for the<br />\nconcert carreid a quotation<br />\nwhich proclaimed Mr. Fournier,<br />\n\"The Keats of the _cello.\"<br />\nSunday's concert bore out that<br />\nappelation, in a way which was<br />\nprobably not considered when<br />\nthe remark was originally\u2022<br />\nformulated.<br />\nIt has been mentioned by<br />\nseveral English scholars that a<br />\nproblem arises in a Romantic<br />\ntradition if its artists become too<br />\nold to maintain the energies of<br />\ntheir youth. In a sense, this is the<br />\ncase with Fournier; he seems to<br />\nhave lost some of the technical<br />\nfinesse of his younger days. He<br />\nhas not, however, lost the<br />\nmusicianship which so long a<br />\ncareer brings, and the result was a<br />\nPerformance containing a level of<br />\nvirtuosity rarely achieved by<br />\nthose possessing extreme<br />\ntechnical accuracy.<br />\nTo open the concert, Fournier<br />\nand his accompanist played the<br />\nSchubert Sonata Arpeggione. The<br />\nWork, although generally classed<br />\nWith the rest of the cello<br />\nliterature, is not a cello piece at<br />\nall; it was actually written for a<br />\nnovv discarded instrument, the<br />\narpeggione.<br />\nThe arpeggione was an<br />\ninstrument related to the gamba<br />\nfamily, and was used for a time<br />\nWhen it was not clear which of<br />\nthe lower strings would remain as<br /><br />\nstandard. Like the gambas, the<br />\narpeggione was not to remain of<br />\nthe scene. (Those interested in<br />\nthe arpeggione should consult the<br />\nDG recording with Klaus Stork,<br />\nArchiv Produktion 2533 175,<br />\nwhich includes some<br />\ndocumentation of the<br />\ninstrument.)<br />\nThe playing was light and<br />\nquick, with a delightful wit and<br />\nclarity. But there were also some<br />\nproblems with notes played<br />\noff-pitch, especially in<br />\nthumb-position; further, some of<br />\nthe notes played with harmonics<br />\nwere not sufficiently projected.<br />\nAnd in the third movement,<br />\nthere was a phrase which was<br />\nsung, rather than played.<br />\nIn a lesser artist, such errors<br />\nwould be inexcusable. Perhaps. it.<br />\nis due to our dependence. Or<br />\norientation to the \"infillible\"<br />\nmedium of recordings, but errors<br />\nof technique are rarely tolerated.<br />\nThis was not the case. There was<br />\nsuch a superb sense of musicality<br />\nthroughout the piece, that the<br />\nerrors were no more significant<br />\nthan Yeats' inability to spell.<br />\nAs the concert proceeded, it<br />\nalso seemed evident that the<br />\nSchubert was a mere warm up<br />\npiece, for the Bach Solo Suite in<br />\nD (No.6) was anything but<br />\ntechnically easy.<br />\nRequiring a complete mastery<br />\nof the instrument, the Bach Solo<br />\nSuites are for cello what the Solo<br />\nSonatas are tor violin or the two<br />\nand three part inventions are for<br />\npiano. In addition to a diverse<br />\nrhythmic content, the suites are<br />\nalso interesting because of the<br />\namount of double- and<br /><br />\ntriple-stopping they require (i.e.,<br />\nthe playing of two or three notes<br />\nat one time).<br />\nIf ontonation or bowing were<br />\na problem, it would be here that<br />\none would notice; Fournier<br />\nplayed the piece as if it had been<br />\nwritten for him. His sense of<br />\narchitecture, tone, and balapce<br />\nmade the piece a pure joy. With a<br />\ndark, rich tone, especially on the<br />\nB and E strings, the full<br />\nresonance of the music was<br />\nmatched only by the roar of<br />\napplause which followed. Faure's Elegie is one of any<br />\ncellist's standars, and is, usually<br />\nplayed with a broad romantic<br />\nstyle. Fournier played with a<br />\ngreat depth . of feeling, yet<br />\navoided the pitfalls of overt<br />\nromantic mannerisms. His<br />\nplaying was warm and lean,<br />\nexploiting the melodic lines<br />\nwithout taxing the textures of<br />\nthe music. The cello blended<br />\nexquisitely with Mr. Pommers<br />\nlucid accompaniment, while<br />\nretaining its identity.<br />\nSurprisingly, Fournier avoided<br />\nthe customarily wide vibrato<br />\nemployed by many French string<br />\nplayers.<br />\nThis was indeed the highlight<br />\nof the concert.<br />\nBrahms' Sonata in F Mahor,<br />\nOp. 99 was to close the program<br />\nand it was the ideal piece to show<br />\noff Fournier's abilities. Requiring<br />\nas much virtuosity as musical<br />\nsense, the Brahm's is<br />\nrhythmically, harmonically and<br />\nstructurally complex. For<br />\nFournier, however, it seemed as<br />\nnatural as an open string note.<br />\nWorking from the inside of the<br /><br />\nmelodic line, the phrases were<br />\nshaped with subtlety and<br />\nbalance. The sonata became a<br />\nmasterpiece of construction and<br />\ninterpretation, a true feat worthy<br />\nof the bravura playing it received.<br />\nThe audience was more than<br />\nappreciative, applauding loudly<br />\nfor several minutes. and<br />\neventually bullying Messr.<br /><br />\nFournier and Ponuners into an<br />\nencore, and then yet anothei<br />\nwith Fournier alone. An though<br />\nthe playing was excellent, and<br />\nthe applause deserved, one<br />\nwonders when Baltimore<br />\naudiences will learn to be<br />\nappreciative without being<br />\npushy.<br /><br />\npage 8/news-letter/november 23, 1976 \u2022<br /><br />\nTerrors terrify<br /><br />\nGridders drop finale to Terrors 29-7, end year 3-5-1<br />\nHoping to attain a seasonal<br />\nmark of .500 for the first time in<br />\nthree years, the Blue Jay football<br />\nteam travelled to Westminster<br />\nSaturday to face arch-rival<br />\nWestern Maryland in, the final<br />\ngame of the 1976 schedule for<br />\nboth clubs.<br />\nThe Hopkins gridders,<br />\nhowever, fell two quarters short<br />\nof their objective as the Green<br />\nTerrors rallied for four second<br />\nhalf touchdowns to defeat JHU,<br />\n29-7.<br />\nFor the Jays, it was a question<br />\nof wasted first half offensive<br />\nopportunities. Hopkins totally<br />\ndominated the first thirty<br />\nminutes of play, and yet, was<br />\nunable to establish a lead that in<br />\nany way reflected this<br />\ndomination.<br />\nParticularly effective through<br />\nthe first two periods was the Jay<br />\ndefense. The Western Maryland<br />\noffense was unable to earn a first<br />\ndown until late in the second<br />\nquarter and their deepest<br />\npenetration of the half was to the<br />\nJHU forty yard line.<br />\nHad the Hopkins offense<br />\nperformed with the same<br />\neffectiveness as its defensive<br />\ncounterpart, the game might have<br />\nbeen settled before halftime. In<br />\nthe initial two quarters, the Jay<br />\noffense had the ball within the<br />\nWestern Maryland thirty-two<br />\nyard line on six different<br />\noccasions and could produce<br />\nonly one score\u2014a Tom Bender to<br />\nBrett Miles twenty-three yard<br />\ntouchdown pass midway through<br />\nthe first quarter.<br />\nAs a result, instead of being<br />\nahead by as much as several<br /><br />\n'<br />\n07<br /><br />\nGreen<br /><br />\nTerrors in action in<br /><br />\ntouchdowns at halftime, the Blue<br />\nJays held a slender 7-0 lead at the<br />\nintermission\u2014enabling the Green<br />\nTerrors to still be very much in<br />\nthe ball game, despite the fact<br />\nthat they had been outplayed in<br />\nevery phase of the contest.<br />\nIt didn't take Western<br />\nMaryland long to tie the score in<br />\nthe second half\u2014only about<br />\nthirteen seconds. Gathering in<br />\nthe opening kick-off at his<br />\ntwenty yard line, the Terror kick<br />\nreturn man\u2022 sped untouched<br />\ndown the sideline eighty yards<br /><br />\nwin over Blue Jays at Westminister<br /><br />\nfor the equalizing touchdown.<br />\nThis incident seemed to swing<br />\nthe momentum to the host team<br />\nand it remained that way<br />\nthroughout the rest of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nOn their two subsequent<br />\npossessions of the ball, the Green<br />\nTerrors drove sixty-eight and<br />\nthirty-seven yards, respectively,<br />\nfor touchdowns and suddenly<br />\nheld a 21-7 lead before the third<br />\nquarter had expired.<br />\nHopkins had several chances to<br />\nclose the gap early in the fourth<br /><br />\nquarter, but once again, the<br />\noffensive machinery faltered.<br />\nBender had a pass intercepted in<br />\nthe end zone to halt one drive,<br />\nwhile a blocked punt recovered<br />\ndeep inside Western Maryland<br />\nterritory could not be converted<br />\nwhen a fourth and two running<br />\nplay lost two yards.<br />\nThe Terrors closed out the<br />\nscoring late in the fourth period<br />\nwhen the quarterback scrambled<br />\nthirty yards for a touchdown,<br />\nalthough the game's outcome had<br />\nbeen decided long before.<br /><br />\nTo the Jays .and their fans, the<br />\nresults of the game had to have<br />\nbeen very discouraging. It left<br />\nHopkins with a final record of<br />\n3-5-1, the third consecutive<br />\nseason that had resulted in that<br />\nexact record.<br />\nHowever, to write off the<br />\nseason as a total loss would be a<br />\nterrible mistake. For /1-1U<br />\nfootball, 1976 was a season of<br />\ntransition. No longer can Blue<br />\nJay football depend on surviving<br />\nby attracting athletes who come<br />\nto Homewood to play lacrosse to<br />\nspend their fall banging heads on<br />\nthe gridiron.<br />\nRather, it is necessary for<br />\nHopkins to begin to depend more<br />\non those players who come to<br />\nJHU specifically to compete in<br />\nfootball.<br />\nHaving begun to make this<br />\ntransition, the future for Blue<br />\nJay football is a bright one. Of<br />\nthe team that started Saturday's<br />\ncontest in Westminster, very few<br />\nwill be leaving as a result of<br />\ngraduation and of those who will<br />\nbe returning, a clear majority<br />\nwere only freshmen and<br />\nsophomores this year\u2014athletes<br />\nwho will benefit greatly from a<br />\nyear of experience.<br />\nThe Future<br />\nWhat is now needed is a<br />\ncontinuation of the successful<br />\nrecruiting program of the past<br />\ntwo years. A large influx of<br />\nfreshmen next September<br />\nprovide the depth that was<br />\nnon-existent on this year's squad<br />\nand will enable Hopkins to<br />\nre-establish a football program of<br />\nwhich the school can truly be<br />\nproud.<br /><br />\nTheologian directs polo to win<br /><br />\nCoach Dick Oles prepares fencers for upcoming season<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Water Polo<br />\nTeam ended its fall season this<br />\npast weekend by participating in<br />\nthe NCA A Division II<br />\nChampionships at Brown<br />\nUniversity. Though winning only<br />\none of three tournament games,<br />\nthe Jays established themselves as<br />\nan up and coming team on the<br />\nEast Coast.<br />\nThe Blue Jays were faced with<br />\na series of problems even before<br />\nthe tournament began. An<br />\novertime loss to Columbia<br />\nUniversity at a seeding<br />\ncompetition the previous<br />\nweekend meant that the Jays<br />\nwere scheduled to play the<br />\nnumber two New England team,<br />\nTrinity College, in the first round<br />\nof the championships.<br />\nIn addition, the start of the<br />\nHopkins swimming season forced<br />\nthe Blue Jays to play without<br />\nseason long starters Bill Sick,<br />\nDean Buchenauer and Todd<br />\nRussell, but there was still<br />\ntalented bench available to coach<br />\nBob Summers. Unfortunately,<br />\ndue to a prior committment,<br />\nCoach Summers had to remain in<br />\nBaltimore and therefore, team<br />\ntheologian Paul Ma was pressed<br />\ninto service as coach.<br />\nAfter the first round game<br />\nagainst Trinity College, the Blue<br />\nJays were talking about<br />\nre-naming themselves the JHU<br />\nWomens Water Polo Team. The<br />\nteam had led at the half by a<br /><br />\ncount of 5-3, but had been<br />\nunable to score in the second half<br />\nand suffered a 7-5 loss.<br />\nAccording to acting-Coach Ma,<br />\n\"Apparently the blood and<br />\ntestosterone doping had little<br />\neffect.\"<br />\nThe Jays showed what<br />\nsubstance they were made of in<br />\nthe second round against heavily<br />\nfavored University of Rhode<br />\nIsland\u2014a team that had lost to<br />\nthe eventual tournament<br />\nchampions Slippery Rock in the<br />\nfinal thirty seconds of their first<br />\ngame.<br />\nTrailing 5-1 going into the<br />\nfourth quarter, the Blue Jays tied<br />\nit up in the final minute of<br />\nregulation play. Two overtime<br />\nperio,ds followed, but each squad<br />\nscored a goal and the count was<br />\nnow tied at 6. In the subsequent<br />\nsudden death overtime period,<br />\nHopkins had several excellent<br />\nopportunities-but could not put<br />\nthe ball into their opponents net.<br />\nEventually, the Jays were<br />\nawarded a man-up situation for<br />\nthirty seconds.<br />\nHowever, Rhode Island<br />\nmanaged to capitalize on its own<br />\nshorthandedness and scored a<br />\nhighly disputed winning goal. It<br />\nseems that the URI coach's wife<br />\nwas the goal judge and the<br />\npartiality of all the refereeing was<br />\nsubsequently questioned.<br />\nAccording to defensive anchor<br />\nMatt Laskowski, ,\"It was<br /><br />\nincredible. I couldn't play as<br />\ndirty as I wanted, but they<br />\ncould.\"<br />\nAgopizingly early the next<br />\nmorning, the Jays played<br />\nVillanova University\u2014a team that<br />\nthey had beaten in overtime two<br />\nweeks earlier to gain a berth in<br />\nthe Eastern Regionals. Hopkins<br />\ndominated from the start and led<br />\nby a score of 6-3 at .the end of<br />\nthe third quarter.<br />\nUnlike the previous meeting<br />\nbetween the two teams, the Jays<br />\nextended their lead in the fourth<br />\nquarter and won going away,8-3.<br />\nIn his last game, senior<br />\nLaskowski scored two goals while<br />\nleading a team composed entirelY<br />\nof freshmen.<br />\nThis fall must be considered a<br />\nsuccessful season for first year<br />\ncoach Summers.
