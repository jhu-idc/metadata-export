We suspect that most of<br />\nthe graduate departments would resist accepting MAT's<br />\nIn their courses for precisely the same objections raised<br />\nin respect to undergraduate courses.<br />\nIf the University cannot provide for courses within<br />\nthe MAT program then it should be discontinued. Perhaps they might take courses in the Evening College<br />\nwhere it appears they would be more comfortable.<br />\n<br />\nGoodbye To All What?<br />\nLike a man riding a kangaroo we have hopped the<br />\nfence and beaten the bush for news, informed analysis,<br />\ndanger and levity. In retrospect let us offer a last gasp<br />\nbefore putting the kangaroo in the garage and going out<br />\nlike a sad old candle.<br />\nWe have not learned humility despite the fact that<br />\n'during our tenure as editors we confronted a drastic<br />\nrevision of the traditional \"hands-off\" policy of the Administration. We would not presume to comment as to<br />\nwhether the revision, has been motivated by a clear end<br />\nof patience with student frailties or an inability to understand or sympathize with student perceptions.<br />\nNevertheless the creation of a Director of Student<br />\nAffairs is a positive indication that the University has<br />\nfinally come to realize that the welfare of the Undergraduate Student Body is essential to the general<br />\nprogress of the University.<br />\nYet if the administrators of what we might construe as a new regard for the undergraduate do not have<br />\nthe courage and vision to make a radical break down<br />\nfrom the past attitudes then we are now cynical enough<br />\nto forwarn of its failure.<br />\nThere must be an honest attempt to bypass traditional methods of Administration-Faculty-Student contact. It will necessitate the giving up of formality and<br />\nholy pinosh. Yet it would be fair trade for real contact<br />\nwith students not necessarily willing to put such concerns on a semi-professional basis.<br />\nOne does not stand to learn very much by conversing with student \"leaders\" at Hopkins. The Hopkins<br />\nleader serves by default and thus is often the least qualified as a conversant or a representative.<br />\nRather, the Administration must find some Way<br />\nof appealing to the nameless, non-contributive mass of<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nThe News-Letter has always regarded this a paramount goal. We derive no small measure of satisfaction<br />\nfrom the fact that we succeeded in both creating and<br />\nbaiting reaction. In doing so we have raised many issues.<br />\nThey are not in themselves important: At the NewsLetter, indeed, \"the medium is the message.\"<br />\nIt is in the context of a medium amount of concern<br />\nfor the state of the University that we offer these last<br />\nremarks,<br />\n<br />\nHomewood Scene<br />\n<br />\nEt Tu MacNamara<br />\nBy HENRY HOCHERMAN<br />\nThe other day, while I was<br />\nwalking quietly along Charles<br />\nStreet, minding my own business, a soothsayer approached,<br />\nand without so much as an introduction, placed his hoary<br />\nhand on my right shoulder and<br />\ngently whispered \"sooth, sooth.\"<br />\nBeing accustomed to the odd<br />\ncharacters that inhabit Charles<br />\nStreet on an afternoon I didn't<br />\nfind this strange at all, but began to become a little apprehensive when he moved yet closer, and in a manner very mysterious looked me in the eye<br />\nand whispered once again \"sooth,<br />\nsooth.\" I tried to pass but he<br />\nwouldn't let me, and by words<br />\nand gestures he motioned me to<br />\nsit with him on a nearby bench.<br />\nThis, with great wonder and<br />\nsome trepidation I proceeded<br />\nto do.<br />\nYou may be wondering now<br />\nhow I knew that he was indeed<br />\na soothsayer, and not some sort<br />\nof low life imposter, a graduate<br />\nstudent perhaps, or a member<br />\nof the student council. For one<br />\nthing, he held a placard that<br />\nsaid SOOTHSAYER (International Brotherhood of Soothsayers, AFL-CIO), for another, he<br />\nwas dressed in standard soothsayer garb, down to a pair of<br />\nrope sandals, but most convincing of all was the fact that he<br />\nwas soothing, as soothsayers invariably must be.<br />\n<br />\nSitting down on the bench he<br />\ngazed at me with a jaundiced<br />\neye and softly said, \"Beware<br />\nthe Ides of March.\" Now we<br />\nwere getting down to business.<br />\nThe Ides of March I'd heard of.<br />\nWith this I could identify, As I<br />\nlooked at him he repeated the<br />\nmysterious phrase, and I came to<br />\nrealize that I recognized his face.<br />\nBeneath the gray beard and worn<br />\nsackcloth was none other than<br />\nGeneral Hershey, Director of the<br />\nSelective Service. Confronting<br />\nhim with this discovery he looked at me deeply and spoke in a<br />\nsoft voice. He seemed to get<br />\nolder right before my eyes, and<br />\nhis tone was sad. He told me<br />\nhe was not General Hershey but<br />\nhis great-great-grandfather, many<br />\nmany generations in the past. He<br />\nhad been in charge of procuring<br />\ntroops for the Spartans in the<br />\nPelopenesian Police Action, and<br />\nhe had known Thucidides. His<br />\nson had fallen at Thermopolae.<br />\nHe looked at me and he spoke,<br />\nand he told me this story, which<br />\nI pass on here for what it may<br />\nbe worth.

That was a nice one;<br />\nbut not unsurpassed in the history of the super-swive survey.<br />\nIt is in his fictional world that<br />\nBarth is a role-player on a grand<br />\nscale, a swiver of more minds<br />\nthan Tom Wolfe has tangerineflakes, and a novelist in the<br />\ntradition of a long line of cosmic jokesters.<br />\nTransformation of a Novelist<br />\nBut John Barth was not always a novelist of the cosmic<br />\nWeltanhis<br />\njoke.

Perhaps the newspaper could get over its present<br />\nproblem of being a \"house organ\"<br />\nby financing itself through student subscriptions. Perhaps it<br />\ncould accept full responsibility<br />\nfor its comments rather than using the University as a shield<br />\nagainst possible libel suits. I<br />\ndon't know.

At this point in<br />\ntime, you are failing to do either.<br />\nEugene Zeltmann<br />\n<br />\nCaptive Frosh<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nHopkins's has many sacred<br />\ncows, but there is one which has<br />\nelicited practically no debate<br />\nthis year. For the benefit of future little Hoppies who will be<br />\narriving on Homewood for intellectual and academic stimulation,<br />\nlet us have some dialogue on the<br />\nUniversity's rule that freshmen<br />\nbe required to live in dormitories.<br />\n0! The bounteous number of<br />\nreasons which our enlightened<br />\nAdministrators may well name!<br />\nThey could ask, \"Why should<br />\nHopkins be different? ALL colleges have this policy.\" They'll<br />\nsurely point out that the incoming freshman does not have the<br />\nresponsibility to live off campus<br />\nand handle his first year in college. The Administration might<br />\neven have the gall to remark<br />\nupon the ideal of the \"Hopkins<br />\nCommunity.\" (a very handy argument, to be used when necessary but ignored most of the<br />\ntime). On an educational plane,<br />\nour dear deans tell us that in<br />\ndormitories, one learns to live<br />\nwith his neighbor and show social maturity. In the venerable<br />\ntradition of high humor, they<br />\nmay quote the pamphlet 'put out<br />\nby Hopkins' Alumni, \"The High<br />\nSchool Student's Question and<br />\nAnswer Guide to the Johns Hopkins University\": It states, \"The<br />\nobjective of the house unit is to<br />\ndevelop unity of purpose and<br />\nidentification with a group<br />\nsmaller than the total dormitory<br />\npopulation.\" Whew!<br />\nWell, why should Hopkins<br />\nchange its policy when other colleges do not? Mainly, because all<br />\noutmoded traditions have to go<br />\nsometimes and naturally, someone has to be the FIRST. The<br />\ntradition has to go for the same<br />\nreason that one doesn't find<br />\nfreshmen wearing beanies anymore. It is ridiculous, it is dated,<br />\nIt is illogical.<br />\nHowever, how can an 18 year<br />\nold freshman possibly have the<br />\nresponsibility to handle the first<br />\nyear in college and live off campus too, without sacrificing<br />\nmarks to a life of debaudhery?<br />\nEasily. He can do it as well as an<br />\n18 year-old sophomore. Yet, of<br />\ncourse there will be those who<br />\nwill not have the responsibility<br />\nbe they 18 or 22, but this is no<br />\nreason for the majority to suffer.<br />\nHopkins's literature continually<br />\nrepeats the theme that the Hopkins man is a mature, welldisciplined creature who is at<br />\nHopkins because of his maturity<br />\nand responsibility. Thus, if the<br />\nstudent doesn't have the maturity and responsibility necessary<br />\nto handle an off-campus life, he<br />\ndoesn't belong here in the first<br />\nplace. (I expect no challenges to<br />\nthat last statement, because I'd<br />\nLate to see anyone accuse the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins' catalogs of doubletalk). In brief, it seems that<br />\nHopkins wants its students to<br />\naccept their responsibilities and<br />\nuphold the University's good<br />\nname, but it is scared stiff of<br />\nletting students exercise a few<br />\n<br />\nof those responsibilities.<br />\nFinally, we are told of the<br />\nvalue of dorm life: one learns to<br />\nlive with others, one gets the feel<br />\nof the \"community,\" one identifies.

BOND<br />\nThe new Senate of the 90th<br />\nCongress will soon encounter the<br />\nfirst test of its potency over ratification of the controversial consular treaty.<br />\nFirst negotiated during the<br />\nEisenhower Administration, the<br />\ntreaty was signed by President<br />\nJohnson in 1964. In 1965-66 the<br />\n89th Congress shelved it in Sen.<br />\nFulbright's (D., Ark.) Foreign Relations Committee where, until<br />\na little over a month ago, it received neither hearings nor introduction on the Senate floor.<br />\nWhen hearings finally began<br />\nlast January 23, it appeared as<br />\nthough the consular treaty would<br />\nsoon die, once and for all. FBI<br />\nDirector J. Edgar Hoover reiterated that giving diplomatic<br />\nimmunity to the 1,018 Soviet officials in the United States would<br />\n<br />\nallow Soviet intelligence agents<br />\nto masquerade as consular employees, thereby making the<br />\nFBI's job much more difficult.<br />\nAnd right-wing lobbying organizations encouraged their audience to write Congressmen in<br />\nprotest of the treaty.<br />\nOriginally Apprehensive<br />\nTo be sure, such pressure has<br />\nmade a number of the 36 Republican senators a bit dubious and<br />\napprehensive about voting to<br />\nratify the treaty. Sen. Karl<br />\nMundt (R., S.D.), ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations<br />\nCommittee, largely<br />\nparroted<br />\nHoover's feelings. Senate Minority Leader Dirksen opposed the<br />\n\"diplomatic immunity\" clause.<br />\nBut something seems to have<br />\nmade the conservative-moderate<br />\nRepublicans come over in favor<br />\nof ratification. Last week Sen.<br />\n<br />\nDirksen (R, Ill.) announced his<br />\nsuport of the treaty, aligning<br />\nwith such vigorous GOP proponents as Sen. Mark Hatfield (R,<br />\nOre.) and Sen. Thruston Morton (R., Ky.) who (to the surprise of many) has long praised<br />\nthe treaty as a \"safe and sound<br />\napproach toward better relations<br />\nwith the Soviet Union.\" With<br />\nsupport mounting, Senate Majority Leader Mansfield (D., Mont.)<br />\nsaid that he will call the consular treaty to a vote this week.<br />\nChanged Attitude<br />\nThe question now is why the<br />\nchanged attitude in the Senate<br />\nRepublican leadership? Perhaps<br />\nthe petition from 15 House Republicans on February 10 urging<br />\ntheir partisans in the Senate to<br />\nratify the treaty did the trick. Or<br />\nperhaps Sen. Margaret Chase<br />\nSmith's (R., Me.) affirmation<br />\n<br />\nfrom Dean Rusk that the security problem of additional consulates is \"both small and controllable\" cooled down antiCommunist tempers. However,<br />\nit might be that after Sen. Dirksen and his followers took a long<br />\nlook at the positive and constructive features of the treaty, they<br />\nabandoned the GOP practice of<br />\nbucking the Democratic majority for the sake of offering an<br />\nopposite alternative, swallowed<br />\ntheir pride in the fight against<br />\n\"me-tooism,\" and sided with<br />\nthose (both Republicans and<br />\nDemocrats) who respond most<br />\nrapidly to the society's changing<br />\nneeds and sentimentsOpponents to the consular<br />\ntreaty have so far sounded highly emotional and irrational.

(Incidentally, the second and third most popular buttons I saw on my last trip<br />\nwere: \"WALLACE BEERY LIVES\" and \"FLUORIDATE MUSCATEL.\" The first most popular button was,<br />\nas we all know,\"SCRAP THE SCRAPE\" which is worn,<br />\nas we all know, by Personna Super Stainless Steel Blade<br />\nusers who, as we all know, are proud to proclaim to the<br />\nworld that they have found a blade which gives them<br />\nluxury shave after luxury shave, which comes both in<br />\ndouble-edge style and Injector style, which does indeed<br />\nscrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull, and oust<br />\nthe ouch, which shaves so closely and quickly and truly<br />\nand beautifully that my heart leaps to tell of it.

I make frequent trips, as I say, to learn<br />\nwhat -is currently vexing the American undergraduate.<br />\nLast week, for example, while visiting a prominent Eastern university (Idaho State) I talked to a number of<br />\nengineering seniors who posed a serious question.

We would not presume to comment as to<br />\nwhether the revision, has been motivated by a clear end<br />\nof patience with student frailties or an inability to understand or sympathize with student perceptions.<br />\nNevertheless the creation of a Director of Student<br />\nAffairs is a positive indication that the University has<br />\nfinally come to realize that the welfare of the Undergraduate Student Body is essential to the general<br />\nprogress of the University.<br />\nYet if the administrators of what we might construe as a new regard for the undergraduate do not have<br />\nthe courage and vision to make a radical break down<br />\nfrom the past attitudes then we are now cynical enough<br />\nto forwarn of its failure.<br />\nThere must be an honest attempt to bypass traditional methods of Administration-Faculty-Student contact. It will necessitate the giving up of formality and<br />\nholy pinosh. Yet it would be fair trade for real contact<br />\nwith students not necessarily willing to put such concerns on a semi-professional basis.<br />\nOne does not stand to learn very much by conversing with student \"leaders\" at Hopkins. The Hopkins<br />\nleader serves by default and thus is often the least qualified as a conversant or a representative.<br />\nRather, the Administration must find some Way<br />\nof appealing to the nameless, non-contributive mass of<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\nThe News-Letter has always regarded this a paramount goal. We derive no small measure of satisfaction<br />\nfrom the fact that we succeeded in both creating and<br />\nbaiting reaction. In doing so we have raised many issues.<br />\nThey are not in themselves important: At the NewsLetter, indeed, \"the medium is the message.\"<br />\nIt is in the context of a medium amount of concern<br />\nfor the state of the University that we offer these last<br />\nremarks,<br /><br />\nHomewood Scene<br /><br />\nEt Tu MacNamara<br />\nBy HENRY HOCHERMAN<br />\nThe other day, while I was<br />\nwalking quietly along Charles<br />\nStreet, minding my own business, a soothsayer approached,<br />\nand without so much as an introduction, placed his hoary<br />\nhand on my right shoulder and<br />\ngently whispered \"sooth, sooth.\"<br />\nBeing accustomed to the odd<br />\ncharacters that inhabit Charles<br />\nStreet on an afternoon I didn't<br />\nfind this strange at all, but began to become a little apprehensive when he moved yet closer, and in a manner very mysterious looked me in the eye<br />\nand whispered once again \"sooth,<br />\nsooth.\" I tried to pass but he<br />\nwouldn't let me, and by words<br />\nand gestures he motioned me to<br />\nsit with him on a nearby bench.<br />\nThis, with great wonder and<br />\nsome trepidation I proceeded<br />\nto do.<br />\nYou may be wondering now<br />\nhow I knew that he was indeed<br />\na soothsayer, and not some sort<br />\nof low life imposter, a graduate<br />\nstudent perhaps, or a member<br />\nof the student council. For one<br />\nthing, he held a placard that<br />\nsaid SOOTHSAYER (International Brotherhood of Soothsayers, AFL-CIO), for another, he<br />\nwas dressed in standard soothsayer garb, down to a pair of<br />\nrope sandals, but most convincing of all was the fact that he<br />\nwas soothing, as soothsayers invariably must be.<br /><br />\nSitting down on the bench he<br />\ngazed at me with a jaundiced<br />\neye and softly said, \"Beware<br />\nthe Ides of March.\" Now we<br />\nwere getting down to business.<br />\nThe Ides of March I'd heard of.<br />\nWith this I could identify, As I<br />\nlooked at him he repeated the<br />\nmysterious phrase, and I came to<br />\nrealize that I recognized his face.<br />\nBeneath the gray beard and worn<br />\nsackcloth was none other than<br />\nGeneral Hershey, Director of the<br />\nSelective Service. Confronting<br />\nhim with this discovery he looked at me deeply and spoke in a<br />\nsoft voice. He seemed to get<br />\nolder right before my eyes, and<br />\nhis tone was sad. He told me<br />\nhe was not General Hershey but<br />\nhis great-great-grandfather, many<br />\nmany generations in the past. He<br />\nhad been in charge of procuring<br />\ntroops for the Spartans in the<br />\nPelopenesian Police Action, and<br />\nhe had known Thucidides. His<br />\nson had fallen at Thermopolae.<br />\nHe looked at me and he spoke,<br />\nand he told me this story, which<br />\nI pass on here for what it may<br />\nbe worth.

That was a nice one;<br />\nbut not unsurpassed in the history of the super-swive survey.<br />\nIt is in his fictional world that<br />\nBarth is a role-player on a grand<br />\nscale, a swiver of more minds<br />\nthan Tom Wolfe has tangerineflakes, and a novelist in the<br />\ntradition of a long line of cosmic jokesters.<br />\nTransformation of a Novelist<br />\nBut John Barth was not always a novelist of the cosmic<br />\nWeltanhis<br />\njoke.

At this point in<br />\ntime, you are failing to do either.<br />\nEugene Zeltmann<br /><br />\nCaptive Frosh<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nHopkins's has many sacred<br />\ncows, but there is one which has<br />\nelicited practically no debate<br />\nthis year. For the benefit of future little Hoppies who will be<br />\narriving on Homewood for intellectual and academic stimulation,<br />\nlet us have some dialogue on the<br />\nUniversity's rule that freshmen<br />\nbe required to live in dormitories.<br />\n0! The bounteous number of<br />\nreasons which our enlightened<br />\nAdministrators may well name!<br />\nThey could ask, \"Why should<br />\nHopkins be different? ALL colleges have this policy.\" They'll<br />\nsurely point out that the incoming freshman does not have the<br />\nresponsibility to live off campus<br />\nand handle his first year in college. The Administration might<br />\neven have the gall to remark<br />\nupon the ideal of the \"Hopkins<br />\nCommunity.\" (a very handy argument, to be used when necessary but ignored most of the<br />\ntime). On an educational plane,<br />\nour dear deans tell us that in<br />\ndormitories, one learns to live<br />\nwith his neighbor and show social maturity. In the venerable<br />\ntradition of high humor, they<br />\nmay quote the pamphlet 'put out<br />\nby Hopkins' Alumni, \"The High<br />\nSchool Student's Question and<br />\nAnswer Guide to the Johns Hopkins University\": It states, \"The<br />\nobjective of the house unit is to<br />\ndevelop unity of purpose and<br />\nidentification with a group<br />\nsmaller than the total dormitory<br />\npopulation.\" Whew!<br />\nWell, why should Hopkins<br />\nchange its policy when other colleges do not? Mainly, because all<br />\noutmoded traditions have to go<br />\nsometimes and naturally, someone has to be the FIRST. The<br />\ntradition has to go for the same<br />\nreason that one doesn't find<br />\nfreshmen wearing beanies anymore. It is ridiculous, it is dated,<br />\nIt is illogical.<br />\nHowever, how can an 18 year<br />\nold freshman possibly have the<br />\nresponsibility to handle the first<br />\nyear in college and live off campus too, without sacrificing<br />\nmarks to a life of debaudhery?<br />\nEasily. He can do it as well as an<br />\n18 year-old sophomore. Yet, of<br />\ncourse there will be those who<br />\nwill not have the responsibility<br />\nbe they 18 or 22, but this is no<br />\nreason for the majority to suffer.<br />\nHopkins's literature continually<br />\nrepeats the theme that the Hopkins man is a mature, welldisciplined creature who is at<br />\nHopkins because of his maturity<br />\nand responsibility. Thus, if the<br />\nstudent doesn't have the maturity and responsibility necessary<br />\nto handle an off-campus life, he<br />\ndoesn't belong here in the first<br />\nplace. (I expect no challenges to<br />\nthat last statement, because I'd<br />\nLate to see anyone accuse the<br /><br />\nHopkins' catalogs of doubletalk). In brief, it seems that<br />\nHopkins wants its students to<br />\naccept their responsibilities and<br />\nuphold the University's good<br />\nname, but it is scared stiff of<br />\nletting students exercise a few<br /><br />\nof those responsibilities.<br />\nFinally, we are told of the<br />\nvalue of dorm life: one learns to<br />\nlive with others, one gets the feel<br />\nof the \"community,\" one identifies.

BOND<br />\nThe new Senate of the 90th<br />\nCongress will soon encounter the<br />\nfirst test of its potency over ratification of the controversial consular treaty.<br />\nFirst negotiated during the<br />\nEisenhower Administration, the<br />\ntreaty was signed by President<br />\nJohnson in 1964. In 1965-66 the<br />\n89th Congress shelved it in Sen.<br />\nFulbright's (D., Ark.) Foreign Relations Committee where, until<br />\na little over a month ago, it received neither hearings nor introduction on the Senate floor.<br />\nWhen hearings finally began<br />\nlast January 23, it appeared as<br />\nthough the consular treaty would<br />\nsoon die, once and for all. FBI<br />\nDirector J. Edgar Hoover reiterated that giving diplomatic<br />\nimmunity to the 1,018 Soviet officials in the United States would<br /><br />\nallow Soviet intelligence agents<br />\nto masquerade as consular employees, thereby making the<br />\nFBI's job much more difficult.<br />\nAnd right-wing lobbying organizations encouraged their audience to write Congressmen in<br />\nprotest of the treaty.<br />\nOriginally Apprehensive<br />\nTo be sure, such pressure has<br />\nmade a number of the 36 Republican senators a bit dubious and<br />\napprehensive about voting to<br />\nratify the treaty. Sen. Karl<br />\nMundt (R., S.D.), ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations<br />\nCommittee, largely<br />\nparroted<br />\nHoover's feelings. Senate Minority Leader Dirksen opposed the<br />\n\"diplomatic immunity\" clause.<br />\nBut something seems to have<br />\nmade the conservative-moderate<br />\nRepublicans come over in favor<br />\nof ratification. Last week Sen.<br /><br />\nDirksen (R, Ill.) announced his<br />\nsuport of the treaty, aligning<br />\nwith such vigorous GOP proponents as Sen. Mark Hatfield (R,<br />\nOre.) and Sen. Thruston Morton (R., Ky.) who (to the surprise of many) has long praised<br />\nthe treaty as a \"safe and sound<br />\napproach toward better relations<br />\nwith the Soviet Union.\" With<br />\nsupport mounting, Senate Majority Leader Mansfield (D., Mont.)<br />\nsaid that he will call the consular treaty to a vote this week.<br />\nChanged Attitude<br />\nThe question now is why the<br />\nchanged attitude in the Senate<br />\nRepublican leadership? Perhaps<br />\nthe petition from 15 House Republicans on February 10 urging<br />\ntheir partisans in the Senate to<br />\nratify the treaty did the trick. Or<br />\nperhaps Sen. Margaret Chase<br />\nSmith's (R., Me.) affirmation<br /><br />\nfrom Dean Rusk that the security problem of additional consulates is \"both small and controllable\" cooled down antiCommunist tempers. However,<br />\nit might be that after Sen. Dirksen and his followers took a long<br />\nlook at the positive and constructive features of the treaty, they<br />\nabandoned the GOP practice of<br />\nbucking the Democratic majority for the sake of offering an<br />\nopposite alternative, swallowed<br />\ntheir pride in the fight against<br />\n\"me-tooism,\" and sided with<br />\nthose (both Republicans and<br />\nDemocrats) who respond most<br />\nrapidly to the society's changing<br />\nneeds and sentimentsOpponents to the consular<br />\ntreaty have so far sounded highly emotional and irrational.

First, if consulates are established, should a<br />\nU.S. citizen be arrested in Russia (or vice versa), the U.S. consulate woud be guaranteed notification of the arrest by Soviet<br />\nofficials within three days, and<br />\nwould have access to the person<br />\nwithin four days of the arrest.<br />\nSince 18,000 Americans visit<br />\nRussia each yeaT (as opposed to<br />\n900 Russians who annually sojourn to the U.S.), it goes without saying that the treaty largely favors U.S. interests.<br />\nAnother Bridge<br />\nSecond, the treaty would mark<br />\nthe building of another \"bridge<br />\nto the East.\" These \"bridges\"<br />\n(such as the Air-Accord treaty<br />\nsigned last November which<br />\nwould provide direct New York<br />\nto Moscow jet service, and the<br />\nCommerce Department's removal<br />\nof tariffs on \"400 non-strategic<br />\nexports\" to the Soviet Union and<br />\nEast European satellites) are vital in securing peace with the<br />\nSoviets without another massive<br />\narms build-up.<br />\nThe Senate Republican leadership in realizing the significance<br />\nof the consular treaty will be intelligent and rational by endorsing ratification of it.

(Incidentally, the second and third most popular buttons I saw on my last trip<br />\nwere: \"WALLACE BEERY LIVES\" and \"FLUORIDATE MUSCATEL.\" The first most popular button was,<br />\nas we all know,\"SCRAP THE SCRAPE\" which is worn,<br />\nas we all know, by Personna Super Stainless Steel Blade<br />\nusers who, as we all know, are proud to proclaim to the<br />\nworld that they have found a blade which gives them<br />\nluxury shave after luxury shave, which comes both in<br />\ndouble-edge style and Injector style, which does indeed<br />\nscrap the scrape, negate the nick, peel the pull, and oust<br />\nthe ouch, which shaves so closely and quickly and truly<br />\nand beautifully that my heart leaps to tell of it. (If perhaps you think me too effusive about Personna, I ask you<br />\nto remember that to me Personna is more than just a<br />\nrazor blade; it is also an employer.)<br />\nBut I digress. I make frequent trips, as I say, to learn<br />\nwhat -is currently vexing the American undergraduate.<br />\nLast week, for example, while visiting a prominent Eastern university (Idaho State) I talked to a number of<br />\nengineering seniors who posed a serious question. Like<br />\nall students, they had come to college burning to fill themselves with culture, but, alas, because of all their science<br />\nrequirements, they simply had had no time to take the<br />\nliberal arts courses their young souls lusted after. \"Are<br />\nwe doomed,\" they asked piteously, \"to go through life<br />\nuncultured?\"<br />\nI answered with a resounding \"No!\" I told them the<br />\nculture they had missed in college, they would pick up<br />\nafter graduation.
