The<br />\nCivil Engineering Department is<br />\npractically finished with its work, and<br />\nhas an array of exhibits calculated to<br />\nbe interesting and instructive for all.<br />\nThe exhibit is under the general direction of J. Trueman Thompson, professor of Civil Engineering.<br />\nIn Latrobe 120, the main hall of the<br />\nCivil Engineering building, the exhibits will particularly emphasize<br />\ntransportation. In the center of the<br />\nroom there will be a miniature railroad, complete in most details. Operating trains of different sorts will be<br />\ncontrolled by a central switching system, while roundhouses, water tanks,<br />\nand the like, will complete the realistic picture.<br />\nAround walls of the hall will be<br />\nfound a chronological panorama of<br />\nthe development of American transportation from 1830 to 1937. Featured<br />\nin this exhibit are a model of the<br />\nPeter Cooper engine, a series of airplanes models including a model of<br />\nthe China Clipper, and a group of<br />\ndioramas which show the development of the American highway. The<br />\nlatter includes a diorama showing the<br />\nNational Pike from Baltimore to Ohio<br />\nIn stage-coach days. The latest shows<br />\na model of the Bath Street Viaduct in<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\n<br />\nOn the stage at the far end of the<br />\nroom will be found four large dioramas, which, sa3rs Professor Thompson \"are the most beautiful and interesting things in that line that I have<br />\nseen.\" One of these is of the Triborough Bridge and is a night scene,<br />\nshowing the moonlight up the water<br />\nand the passing rows of cars. Another diorama shows the possibilities<br />\nof slum clearance by comparing in intimate detail a section in the slums<br />\nand a newly built section having the<br />\nlow-rent apartment houses. The third<br />\nand fourth dioramas both have to do<br />\nwith flood control. One shows the<br />\nhavoc wrought by a flood, while the<br />\nother shows a large dam in the distance and a rebuilt community.<br />\nVarious types of drivers' tests will<br />\nbe given in Latrobe 214. Any visitor<br />\nwho so desires may take these tests,<br />\nwhich include tests of steering ability,<br />\nability to judge distances, quickness<br />\nin jamming on brakes in an emergency, and the effect the glare of<br />\nheadlights has upon the person's ability to see while driving at night.

At present, the report runs, the Board has narrowed<br />\nits field down to the \"all-star\" aggregations of Crooner Crosby and trombonist Dorsey, who toiled together<br />\ntwo years ago in the old Dorsey<br />\nBrothers combination.<br />\nWhich puts those earnest souls to<br />\nwhom swing is an all-embracing passion in rather a hot spot. If the<br />\nBoard chooses Crosby it will rend<br />\ntheir artistic natures by depriving<br />\nthem of an opportunity to hear Mr.<br />\nDorsey and his trombone along with<br />\nBud Freeman and his tenor sax, Jeff<br />\nDixon and his clarinet, Max Kaminsky<br />\nand his trumpet, and Dave Tough and<br />\nhis drums. And that, according to<br />\none half-tearful swingtaster, speaking from the card-tables of Levering<br />\nHall, is quite a deprivation.<br />\nBut suppose, as this reporter suggested in giant ignorance, we pass<br />\nup the younger Crosby and take Dorsey instead. His informant looked<br />\nup tragically from a careful study<br />\nof the hand on which he has just bid<br />\nfour.<br />\nhe said, \"there's the rub.\"<br />\nDid the reporter not realize that<br />\nthe Crosby Orchestra is one of the<br />\nmost significant representatives of<br />\nthe modern movement?

The<br />\nCivil Engineering Department is<br />\npractically finished with its work, and<br />\nhas an array of exhibits calculated to<br />\nbe interesting and instructive for all.<br />\nThe exhibit is under the general direction of J. Trueman Thompson, professor of Civil Engineering.<br />\nIn Latrobe 120, the main hall of the<br />\nCivil Engineering building, the exhibits will particularly emphasize<br />\ntransportation. In the center of the<br />\nroom there will be a miniature railroad, complete in most details. Operating trains of different sorts will be<br />\ncontrolled by a central switching system, while roundhouses, water tanks,<br />\nand the like, will complete the realistic picture.<br />\nAround walls of the hall will be<br />\nfound a chronological panorama of<br />\nthe development of American transportation from 1830 to 1937. Featured<br />\nin this exhibit are a model of the<br />\nPeter Cooper engine, a series of airplanes models including a model of<br />\nthe China Clipper, and a group of<br />\ndioramas which show the development of the American highway. The<br />\nlatter includes a diorama showing the<br />\nNational Pike from Baltimore to Ohio<br />\nIn stage-coach days. The latest shows<br />\na model of the Bath Street Viaduct in<br />\nBaltimore.<br /><br />\nOn the stage at the far end of the<br />\nroom will be found four large dioramas, which, sa3rs Professor Thompson \"are the most beautiful and interesting things in that line that I have<br />\nseen.\" One of these is of the Triborough Bridge and is a night scene,<br />\nshowing the moonlight up the water<br />\nand the passing rows of cars. Another diorama shows the possibilities<br />\nof slum clearance by comparing in intimate detail a section in the slums<br />\nand a newly built section having the<br />\nlow-rent apartment houses. The third<br />\nand fourth dioramas both have to do<br />\nwith flood control. One shows the<br />\nhavoc wrought by a flood, while the<br />\nother shows a large dam in the distance and a rebuilt community.<br />\nVarious types of drivers' tests will<br />\nbe given in Latrobe 214. Any visitor<br />\nwho so desires may take these tests,<br />\nwhich include tests of steering ability,<br />\nability to judge distances, quickness<br />\nin jamming on brakes in an emergency, and the effect the glare of<br />\nheadlights has upon the person's ability to see while driving at night. Moreover, the motion picture \"Saving Seconds\" will be shown.<br />\nThe visitor to the show will be able<br />\nto enter the Highway Engineering<br />\nand Hydraulics laboratories and see<br />\nthere the routine work being carried<br />\non.<br />\nSome of the research work in the<br />\nDepartment will be shown to visitors.<br />\nA desk type motion picture machine<br />\nwill be in operation and will show<br />\nsome of the 40,000 lineal feet of film<br />\ntaken of traffic in an attempt to de(Continued on Page 3, Cot. 2)<br /><br />\nSituation Wherein EduTall Hopkins Squad Paired<br />\ncation Is Incomplete<br />\nWith Small But Scrappy<br />\n- -Foes<br />\nSpeaks On Duty Of Church<br />\nIn Teaching Of Sex<br />\nLeague LeadAtStake<br />\nRelations<br />\nEducational institutions and the Annapolis Team Has Yet To<br />\nChalk Up Initial<br />\nchurch must teach youth \"the basic<br />\nfacts about sex relations and marriage<br />\nWin<br />\nbefore young people can derive<br />\nfrom it the happiness it should yield,\"<br />\nDr. S.

He illustrated his talk with<br />\nseveral cases in which the husband<br />\nand wife had had exactly opposite<br />\nlikes and dislikes, and where it came<br />\nto the point that neither of them enjoyed doing anything mutually.<br /><br />\nDr. Harlow also felt that if women<br />\ndid the choosing, instead of men,<br />\nthere would be fewer unhappy marriages. \"Man is a creature of short<br />\nrange emotions, and he thinks almost<br />\nentirely in terms of the present.<br />\nIn Re Class Dues<br />\nWoman is created with long range<br />\nis<br />\nWe feel that a few remarks about emotions and to her the future<br />\nmore important than the present,\" he<br />\nrein<br />\nthe new system of class dues<br />\nsaid.<br />\nspect to its adoption would be approThe five prerequisites for happy<br />\npriate.<br />\nmarriage which he set up were:<br />\nThe Student Council, in participat\"Emotional love, mental and spir-<br /><br />\nOPEN LETTERS<br />\nCarolina Chemist TWO<br />\nIn Re Assemblies<br />\nI<br />\nDohme Lecturer<br />\nHead Of Chemistry Department To Lecture On<br />\n\"Molecule Mechanics\"<br /><br />\nAt this time, we wish to make<br />\nknown the final arrangements con-<br /><br />\ncerning assemblies.<br />\nThe assembly system is, as always,<br /><br />\nunder the control of the Student Council, but for the two months of Feb- ing in the recommendation of this itual adaption, which he classed unDr. Mack of the Department of<br />\nruary and March an experiment will plan, has not passed any unconstitu- der 'liking'; ability to get along with<br />\nChemistry, at the University of North<br />\nrelatives and friends; ability to adapt<br />\nconducted by making assemblies tional or \"undemocratic edict.\"<br />\nCarolina, will deliver a Dohme Lecture be<br />\neach other to the necessary budgeting;<br />\nFirst of all, anyone or any organthis afternoon at 4.00 o'clock in Room voluntary.
