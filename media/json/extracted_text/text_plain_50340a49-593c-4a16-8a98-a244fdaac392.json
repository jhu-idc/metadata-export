Arnir Halevy, the chairman<br />\nof the Student Legal Rights<br />\nCommittee, is the chief author<br />\nof the code, which establishes<br />\nguidelines for hearing non-academic disciplinary actions. With<br />\nthe help of the University<br />\ncounsel, and using a draft which<br />\nlast year's Council worked on as<br />\na reference, Halevy will propose<br />\nthe Code to the full Council for<br />\na final vote within the next 3<br />\nweeks.<br />\nAt the Student Council<br />\nmeeting of Oct. 1, most articles<br />\nof the proposal were considered<br />\nand discussed. A non-binding<br />\nstraw vote was taken for each<br />\narticle and all those considered<br />\nwere approved. The Council will<br />\ntake a final vote on the code as a<br />\nwhole next week, once the<br />\nfreshman representatives are elected.<br />\nIf the code is approved by<br />\nthe Council, it will then be<br />\npresented to Dean Michael<br />\nHooker and Jakie Hall.

He is teaching<br />\ntwo seminar classes.<br />\n(interviewed by Daisy Taylor)<br />\nN-L: Is class discussion<br />\nan efficient way to bring<br />\nacross information in<br />\nyour field? Is it useful to<br />\nwhat you teach'?<br />\nHarvey: I think it depends on the kind of<br />\ninformation you want to<br />\nimpart. If there's a lot of<br />\nractual information, then<br />\nobviously class discussion<br />\n-sn't a terribly good way<br />\nto do it unless you set<br />\npeople in the class cer-:ain tasks, to get the<br />\ninformation, and then<br />\nthey come in and<br />\ngive you the information. But then there's other kinds<br />\nof information, particularly conceptual information,<br />\nideas, which is very difficult to impart except by discussion. Because we can all use a concept like neighborhood or community, we all think we know what we<br />\nmean by it. But if you have discussion it becomes very<br />\nclear that everybody has a different interpretation.<br />\nIf I talk about a concept of neighborhood, and I am<br />\ntalking all the time and everybody's interpreting it in<br />\ntheir way then there is a failure of communication.<br />\nSo I think it's very important when you're<br />\ndealing with concepts like that to discuss what they<br />\nmean, and via some kind of dialogue come to some<br />\nrange of definitions. Clearly the more directly factual<br />\nmaterial can be put across in another way, but I tend to<br />\ntake the view that people can go and read that anywhere. It seems to me the important point of class<br />\ndiscussion is to complement the kind of factual reading<br />\nwith a conceptual framework within which to interpret<br />\nthose facts.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that the quality or ease of class<br />\ndiscussion has varied over the years or in other universities where you have taught?<br />\nHarvey: I have never figured out why the quality varies<br />\nSO much. I think part of the reason behind it is that if<br />\nyou allow a lot of class discussion and rely a lot on class<br />\ndiscussion you're never going to satisfy all the people all<br />\nof the time. There is certain sort of anarchistic tangential aspect to it ...you never know whether something is<br />\ntangential until you've followed it. You're constantly<br />\ntrying to deal with a situation in which there is a certain<br />\namount of chaos. I guess I take the view that it takes<br />\na little chaos to do anything, and personally I'd rather<br />\nlet the chaos flourish a bit and try to get something<br />\ncreative out of it than to stick with the much more<br />\nauthorian kind of lecture style.<br />\nN-L: What factors do you feel contribute to resistance<br />\non the part of students to participating in class?<br />\nHarvey: Well, there's a whole range of personal factors.<br />\nSome people feel comfortable verbalizing, some don't.<br />\nThere's a kind of tradition at certain schools; Hopkins<br />\nis kind of authoritarian in general. I think maybe<br />\nstudents here are not terribly familiar or used to the idea<br />\nof open class discussion or disagreeing with the professor<br />\nand having an argument with the professor and feeling<br />\nthat they can do that without necessarily jeopardizing<br />\ntheir grade. Under those conditions most people won't<br />\ntake on a professor and argue. The best discussions are<br />\nthose where people are going to argue because that<br />\nsharpens both sides. But there's a natural resistance to<br />\nthat and it takes a long time to get by that.<br />\nFrom the standpoint of the teacher, there's a real<br />\ndifficulty in figuring out at what point you actually<br />\nintervene. The discussion is never entirely open: there's<br />\nalways an authority there. At what point do you exert<br />\n<br />\nyour authority and cut a discussion off'? There's no<br />\nexact charter for saying when you should and when you<br />\nshouldn't. You play it by ear. So there's a barrier there<br />\nbecause you're always conscious and aware that even<br />\nthough it's a reasonably open discussion and the students are discussing with each other, you're still the<br />\nreserve authority.<br />\nN-L: How long have you been teaching here?<br />\nHarvey: Ten years.<br />\nN-L: Have you always been using discussion and felt it<br />\nwas important?<br />\nHarvey: I haven't given a lecture for I don't know how<br />\nlong. I don't like to operate that way, partly because I<br />\ncame here from Britain where it was all formal lecture<br />\nand there is absolutely no interaction at all with students. I think one of the things I valued about coming<br />\nhere was that I could get away from that and try to<br />\nwork in terms of class discussion, and work through<br />\nmaterial through class discussion. That has to do with<br />\nthe fact that I'm very much more interested now in<br />\ndiscussing concepts and ideas rather than factual information.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything you would like to add?<br />\nHarvey: It would be very interesting to get a very frank<br />\nappraisal from students as to how they think class<br />\ndiscussions go. I would be interested in that because I<br />\nnever get a very frank appraisal of it. I would be very<br />\nsurprised if you didn't have something like a 50%<br />\ndiscontent rate with any open discussion. But then<br />\nyou're going to get some kind of discontent rate also<br />\nwith the standard lecture format. The only difference is<br />\nthat if you have a really good lecturer who can turn in<br />\na performance and it's a sort of entertaining performance, you're entertained and you don't have to work at it<br />\nso much. But I think, particularly if the students take<br />\nthe obligation to discuss seriously, you probably end up<br />\nlearning more. Things that you are forced to discuss<br />\nreally stick with you in ways that the entertaining<br />\nlecture doesn't. One of the things I found when I moved<br />\nfrom being a student to being a teacher is that I learned<br />\nmuch more from being a teacher than I ever learned<br />\nfrom being a student. I think one of the reasons I<br />\nwanted to shift to putting some of the burden of doing<br />\nthe teaching on the students themselves is to try to make<br />\nthem learn more. Whether it works or not, who knows.<br />\nOne year you can use the same format as you used the<br />\nyear before and it's a disaster, and the year before it was<br />\nterrific.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Kenneth Lynn<br />\nProfessor Lynn teaches the 19th- and 20th-Century<br />\nAmerican Intellectual History courses.<br />\n(Interviewed by David Newman)<br />\n<br />\nN-L: Why is discussion so<br />\nimportant to what you<br />\nteach?<br />\nLynn: I'm interested in<br />\nthe comments and opinions of students, to begin<br />\nwith. I often find that<br />\nthey bring up problems<br />\nI haven't thought of.<br />\nSometimes, also, I find<br />\nthat the student or students haven't understood<br />\nthe books; in a lecture<br />\ncourse, I could go on for<br />\nhours talking at crosspurposes and not knowing what the students<br />\ndidn't understand.<br />\nAlso, it gets away from education as spectator<br />\nsport. Students are only passively encouraged by lecture<br />\ncourses or television. A discussion is useful because it<br />\n<br />\nallows the student to make a case.<br />\nN-L: What hinders a good discussion?<br />\nLynn: I regard the number one problem as whether or<br />\nnot students have done the reading. I assign the keeping<br />\nof a journal, in which the students make weekly entries,<br />\nas a device to get students to do the reading from<br />\nweek to week. Obviously, there is nothing less productive than a discussion on a false basis, one about which<br />\nthere is a phony quality. A professor must figure out<br />\nsome device to get students to do the reading--I use the<br />\njournal, but I'm sure there are other methods.<br />\nN-L: But what if they have done the work, and discussion has reached an impasse?<br />\nLynn: Impasse could make for a \\ ery lively discussion.<br />\nI've found a more stilted situation where the professor<br />\ndominates and one or two students Ltre the only people<br />\ntalking. A good descussion resembles some discussion<br />\nheld outside of class; the participants should be free of<br />\nthe 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' mentality<br />\nwhere everyone is fawning for an 'A' A good discussion<br />\nwill be a free-swinging one, full of participation, and the<br />\nprofessor should be one of many voices.<br />\nN-L: How has the quality of discussion changed from<br />\nyear to year, and have you noticed differences between<br />\nhere and Harvard (where Lynn was formerly chairman of<br />\nthe American Studies program)?<br />\nLynn: I think that the students are more conscientious<br />\nabout doing the work today. There was time when<br />\nassigning the keeping of a journal did not guarantee a<br />\ndiscussion. In the early 70's, there was still enough<br />\nanti-intellectual suspicion that students weren't doing<br />\nthe work.<br />\nAt Harvard, there were more similarities than<br />\ndifferences.

I had<br />\nlarge<br />\ngiven<br />\nalways<br />\nlecture courses, and the key thing about these courses in<br />\nterms of class discussion, was that if I were careful<br />\nenough about it in terms of not squelching questions,<br />\nand recognizing people who have their hand half way up.<br />\nor have a quizical expression what I generally got were<br />\nquestions that really helped everyone because I had been<br />\nunclear or obscure about some point. Very few students<br />\nmake points which are just irrelevant, and I know in<br />\nmy physiology course it takes several lextures before<br />\npeople begin to realize that even they can raise their<br />\nhand.

When you try to teach science students to ask<br />\nwhy we investigate this question and not that they<br />\ncouldn't care less. \"Just tell me what we really know.\"<br />\nThe core curriculum teaches you to go back, to question. It opened up questions that shook me about what<br />\nI'm doing in the field. The students in general were not<br />\nprepared for the professors to have such different<br />\nperspectives, which left the question to the student:<br />\n\"My god the teacher isn't going to tell me what the truth<br />\nis. I must think about it myself.\" I have certain insights<br />\nwhich I'd like to sell. I also know I want to learn about<br />\nwhat life looks like to other people too. When I'm not<br />\npursuing a set body of knowledge, I think class discussion is very important, but I have a lot to learn about<br />\nhow not togive a lecture and how to stimulate the class so<br />\nthat they also want to participate.<br />\nN-L: Are there difficulties in stimulating class discussion<br />\npeculiar to this pre-professional school?<br />\nCone: Yes, I find it very difficult in both of my courses.<br />\n..At the I lopkins day school it's particularly difficult to<br />\nget a discussion off the ground. A few summers ago I<br />\ntaught at the Alumni college, and if I raised the question<br />\nthe room was off...Everyone had something to say. It<br />\ntakes a long time before the students begin to get the<br />\npicture of what's accessible to them. The norm of most<br />\nof the courses one takes at Hopkins is that the teacher<br />\nteaches you something they think you ought to know,<br />\nand you know you ought to learn it because you're<br />\ngoing to be examined on it; to come up with a remark<br />\nthat you know or you think is interesting to me, is<br />\nirrelevant. There is a lot of peer pressure to shut up:<br />\n\"Quit wasting our time, and let the expert talk.\" We are<br />\njust scientists preaching our religion. Science is so<br />\nuniversally revered as the method, the way to understand things, that a scientist, teaching science is very<br />\nmuch like a true believer. I really think that science is in<br />\nmany ways the most powerful religion around. It goes<br />\nbeyond a religion, we all believe in it, and when I teach<br />\nit It's like I'm preaching. But in pursuing a course that's<br />\naimed at questions like how we live and how might we<br />\nlive, we're all experts and we're all naive.<br />\nIn the sixties there was a lot of activism by<br />\nstudents. They had the sense of challenging the r rofessor, like \"Why are you teaching me this? Why should I learn<br />\nthis'?\" In the seventies the students come in wanting to<br />\nlearn, doing what the professor wants, and not questioning the system. The last few years there has been<br />\nquestioning again, but it has not been coining in with the<br />\nsame intensity.<br />\nIn trying to handle the issue of class<br />\nparticipation, it was very clear to me that I couldn't<br />\nput together a body of knowledge that I knew they<br />\nneeded to know. I'll talk about things I'm excited<br />\nabout, but that doesn't mean that that is what they need<br />\nto know. That's why I hit upon the idea of using papers<br />\neven in a science course. The students think of a question they are truly interested in. and I have them look<br />\ninto the literature to digest enough of it to understand it<br />\nand tell it to another person in an intelligible , interesting way. So they write the papers for each other, not<br />\nfor me.<br />\nThe writing and reading of the peer-graded.<br />\npapers worked very well. Their grade is in part determined by how you (students) evaluate that person's<br />\nwork. and that's real class participation. This leads to<br />\nan understanding of what it takes to write well. The<br />\ntrouble with class discussion when you're trying to get<br />\nacross a corpus of knowledge is that is can help to<br />\nunderstand a difficult point, but it is an inefficient<br />\nprocedure for memorizing facts. I have not figured out a<br />\nway to use discussion in physiology. Some of the TA's<br />\nhave had success in group discussion, but usually with<br />\nvery few students. That is because I took away the usual<br />\nthing which makes you go to discussion, the final exam.<br />\nso the discussion is just plain learning for you. and very<br />\nfew people come. It is very different if there is going to<br />\nbe a final exam and the discussion topics are going to be<br />\non that exam. It's been hard to make a discussion<br />\nsection so valuable that students come because they<br />\nwant to learn; because they're excited about it.<br />\n<br />\nWhat Hopkins is missing is a student evaluation<br />\nof teaching which is so accurate and informative that the<br />\nfaculty really are concerned with the evaluation of their Dr. Richard Macksey is the chairman of the Humanities<br />\nteaching.

But if the function of<br />\nthe course is to provide an environment in which people<br />\nlearn to use their own minds no matter what the material is, then you must have a class discussion. And clearly<br />\nif you have a class of fifteen people, and only two or<br />\nthree people are talking, it defeats the whole purpose of<br />\nths discussion. But with undergraduates, especially at<br />\nthis university, I increasingly see the need to have only<br />\nclass discussions. The university I came from before<br />\n(University of Chicago) was a place that encouraged<br />\nseminar class discussions from the beginning. I think<br />\nthat this is not the style of education here. It is largely<br />\nprofessor-delivered rather than interaction between<br />\nstudents overseen and guided by a professor. The reason<br />\nthat class discussion formats are useful is that in an<br />\ninteraction of different kinds of people you see your<br />\nmind as it is seen by other people, as it operates. If<br />\nyou're just thinking by yourself, working by yourself, a<br />\nprofessor for that matter, just sort of delivering to<br />\nhimself ideas that he has, there is no device for easily<br />\nobtaining a critical view of the was you are thinking,<br />\nwhat you're saying. But in a class discussion, you always<br />\nhave an environment that is continuously, dynamically<br />\ndialectical. You will find that not only are you thinking<br />\nin ways that seem perhaps odd to other people, but that<br />\nwhen you deliver the way you think, people receive it in<br />\nskewed ways. So that is becomes really important is a<br />\nclass discussion for a person to try to make their own<br />\nmind, not only clear to themselves, but to the people<br />\nthey are talking to. That is one of the principal functions in a pedagogical situation. It is especially important right here where so many people seem to work in<br />\nisolation.<br />\nN-L: Do you find in the classes you have taught here or<br />\nat Chicago that interaction naturally occurs?<br />\nMcGann: It happens here less easily than it happened at<br />\nChicago. The reason, in my opinion, is that at Chicago<br />\nwhen people come into the university, they are instantly<br />\ninvolved in various kinds of discussion groups. They are<br />\nintroduced to an environment that encourages interaction between students, and, in fact, the faculty member<br />\nis then pulled into a peculiar kind of relation with the<br />\nstudents. There's much less separation between faculty<br />\nand students at Chicago that there is at Hopkins. Not<br />\nthat people don't get along here or are not friendly, it's<br />\njust that the nature of the educational interaction is very<br />\ndifferent. Students are more deferential to faculty here<br />\nthan they are at Chicago. Not that there isn't respect at<br />\nChicago, it's just that the respect is of a different quality. There will be fewer barriers; classroom discussion<br />\nwill be much freer. Students here, for example, seem to<br />\nme to be more timid, and therefore more reluctant to<br />\nbecome involved in discussion. In order to alter the<br />\nsituation I think you'd have to introduce students at<br />\nlarge to this kind of educational method earlier, right at<br />\nthe beginning, to freshmen. Then you would see, if it<br />\nwere done in a comprehensive way, or even in a much<br />\nmore general way than it is done now, a sharp change.<br />\nOne of the reasons that there is more communication in the classroom between people at Chicago than<br />\nthere is here is because, in the first year, people who are<br />\ninvolved in Humanities there will all be reading the same<br />\ntexts. You'll have three or four hundred people all<br />\nreading at approximately the same time the History of<br />\nthe Pelopponesian Wars or the book of Genesis or War<br />\nand Peace, so that outside the classroom, you have<br />\nliterally hundreds of people wandering around all being<br />\ninvolved in the same texts. Clearly a lot of talk is going<br />\non between the students and it carries when you<br />\ncome back into the class. The class bell will ring, the<br />\nclass will be over, and the conversation will still be going<br />\non, because people have in fact incorporated this material into part of their daily lives. There is very little<br />\ncommon education at Hopkins. That also tends to break<br />\ndown the success of class discussion.<br />\nN-L: How many years have you been here?<br />\nMcGann: Five.<br />\nN-L: Since you have been here has there been any<br />\nchange in student response?<br />\nMcGann: Every other year, I try to teach a modified<br />\nversion of one of the several Freshman Humanities<br />\ncourses that I taught at Chicago. When the freshmen<br />\ncome they are a little diffident about getting involved in<br />\n<br />\ndiscussion. But once you get the class to have a sense of<br />\nitself it will normally turn out that the class will be<br />\nwilling to, anxious in fact, to be talking in itself, its<br />\nvarious members talking to each other, about whatever it<br />\nis that's up for discussion. Later on, when you have<br />\nclass discussions in upper level courses, the amount of<br />\ndiffidence and the difficulty of getting the students<br />\nto interact with each other seems to be much greater.<br />\nWhen I first came I taught freshmen and everything worked out well. I still see a lot of those students.<br />\nI taught freshmen last year,and I still see a lot of those<br />\nstudents too. That kind of class tends to encourage<br />\ncommunity and people getting to know each other<br />\nbecause they're talking to each other.<br />\nN-L: So the main problem with class discussion is the<br />\nway the university itself sets up education.<br />\nMcGann: Yes. I have certain ideas about what I think is<br />\nuseful for the development of a vital undergraduate<br />\neducation. Some people have other ideas. My ideas<br />\nwere formed under the influence of the undergraduate<br />\nschool at the University of Chicago.<br />\nN-L: Once you have the classroom situation, how do<br />\nyou encourage discussion? How do you bring people in<br />\nand encourage them to speak?<br />\nMcGann: There are various ways of doing this. First of<br />\nall you have to set up a course in such a way that you<br />\nforce people to be involved with each other. In the<br />\nfreshman Humanities courses I have taught here what<br />\nI've done is to have the students write a fair number of<br />\npapers during a semester or preferably a year, and then<br />\nto break down the class into groups of 5,6,or 7 people<br />\nand you meet with them in tutorial sessions that focus<br />\naround their papers on a common subject. Then in that<br />\nmuch smaller discussion group, you have people talk<br />\nabout these common subjects, and about the way other<br />\npeople have written about them. It doesn't really matter<br />\ntoo much whether the subject of your conversation is<br />\nthe rhetorical presentation of the material or the substance, the point is to get people to talk with each other<br />\nand thereby generate an atmosphere that encourages<br />\nindeed to develop that kind of<br />\ncritical thinking, and<br />\nsary if you are ever going to<br />\nnecesis<br />\nthat<br />\ngenerosity<br />\nhave real critical interaction between people, not just<br />\ncan't have criticism if<br />\nbeing destructive, in fact you<br />\nthere's that kind of hostility in .an interaction.<br />\nThere must be generosity as well as honesty. So you have to set a course up in such a way that<br />\nstudents are forced to do something that in fact ordinarily they would not do. I belive that students generally<br />\nlike to do this and find it useful pedagogically, enlightening in various kinds of ways, and even fun. In other<br />\ncourses similar techniques'have to be evolved. One that<br />\nI found very useful was to break the course down, again,<br />\ninto smaller groups. Say you have a course in Contemporary American Poetry with about 20 students in it,<br />\nyou would divide them into groups of 3 or 4 - it doesn't<br />\nreally matter - and assign them a problem, which then<br />\neach group at specified times during the course of the<br />\nyear would bring in and present to the class, let's say<br />\non the early poetry of James Merrill or something like<br />\nthat. Then you have to consult with them frequently to<br />\nfind out what they are doing, and most important of all,<br />\nyou have to make sure that when they bring their<br />\nmaterial in, they do not lecture to the class. The point<br />\nof this sort of structuring device is to get 3 or 4 people<br />\ncommunally involved themselves in a research venture<br />\noutside the classroom so that they are involved with<br />\neach other outside of class, and then bringing it in so<br />\nthat they then are faced with the problem of being<br />\ninvolved and being responsible for generating discussion<br />\nin the classroom itself. When I have done this (only<br />\nonce at Hopkins) there has been resistance and even fear.<br />\nBut I have always found that once you get over the<br />\ninitial resistance the people love it. They like to be<br />\ninvolved with other people in common pursuits and it is<br />\nvery useful pedagogically for the whole class. Then<br />\nin the classroom itself there are other sorts of ad hoc<br />\nlocal techniques. Whenever you are running a discussion<br />\nthere will be 15 people there and there will always be<br />\nsay a group of four or five who are, just by nature,<br />\nanxious to talk in those kinds of circumstances. Sometimes people like that are not at all helpful to discussion,<br />\nthey tend to kill discussion, because they want to talk all<br />\nthe time. So one of the problems in discussion classes is<br />\nshutting off people who tend to talk too much. The<br />\nother problem is encouraging people who are more<br />\n<br />\ndiffident to get involved. Sometimes a person is shy to<br />\nsuch a degree that you really can't do much more than<br />\nask them, force them, to deliver their share of the<br />\nresponsibility fo the class discussion, say a class presentation on a particular day. But it is possible to interrogate the class in such a way that you encourage people<br />\nto say what is on their mind. One of the problems in<br />\nclass discussion is that questions are posed in such<br />\na way, either by the teacher or by the students who are<br />\nrunning the class, that other people don't know how to<br />\nanswer the question. They're not posed correctly.<br />\nFrequently in a class discussion I'll come in and pose a<br />\nquestion and I'll look and, blank, nothing is happening.<br />\nThat means the question was posed stupidly.<br />\nAt that point you have to interrogate the question. I'll<br />\nhave posed the question that way not because I hadn't<br />\nthought it through: it seemed to me in the solitude of<br />\nmy study an important question, something that would<br />\nwork in a discussion. I'll bring it into the class and it<br />\nwill fall dead. I have to find out why. The only way to<br />\ndo that is to ask the class why they find it opaque, what<br />\nis it that is not jumping across. When you open up that<br />\nset of questions, the initial question will, I must say,find<br />\nits proper formulation. There are lots of other local<br />\ndevices of this kind What you're trying to do is not to<br />\nwant a kind of pseudo-Socratic classroom discussion, but<br />\nactually find out what it is that people in the class are<br />\ninterested in. To finally subject those questions to a<br />\ncritique is to form your opinions. There are two passages in Whitman that are great injunctions for teachers.<br />\nOne, in \"Song of Myself': \"He most honors my style<br />\nwho learns under it to destroy the teacher.\" That seems<br />\nto me a proverb that every teacher, and certainly every<br />\nstudent, should honor. There's another one a little<br />\ndown the road from that: \"He that spreads a wider<br />\nbreast than my own, proved the width of my own.\"<br />\nMy conception of class discussion and the<br />\nseminar format pivots around my sense of the importance of those two proverbs.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Lee Patterson<br />\nDr. Lee Patterson, of the English Department, offers his<br />\ncomments on class discussion in the context of the literature he teaches. He is currently teaching a seminar<br />\ncourse on the Epic.<br />\nMany, probably most of the contexts in which<br />\nliterary conversation takes place are, and always have<br />\nbeen, institutional, places authorized by society for just<br />\nsuch aesthetic exchanges. One thinks not just of the<br />\nclassroom but also ofthe salon, in all its historical guises,<br />\nor the Germanic or Achaian feasthall where a (preferably<br />\nblind) singer would chant the wisdom of the race. But<br />\npoets have taken pains to remind us that literature is also<br />\nable to constitute its own context, to prescribe if not to<br />\ncontrol the terms ofits own reception. Sometimes these<br />\nterms are explicitly subversive - Paolo and Francesca<br />\nseduced by Arthurian tales, Emma Bovary immersed in<br />\nromantic novels - but at other times they define a<br />\ncontext that is itself social, itself an instructive alternative to our more usual settings. An early instance occurs<br />\nin Book XV of the Odyssey. Odysseus has returned to<br />\nlthaka disguised as a Cretan exile and finds shelter with<br />\nhis swineherd Eumaios, and the two men pass the night<br />\ntelling stories. Maintaining his disguise, Odysseus begins<br />\nwith a tall tale that he fabricates in order to teach<br />\nEumaios that suppliants like him are protected by the<br />\ngods, a fact that their hosts should remember. Eumaios'<br />\nresponse - the true story of his own sufferings - is<br />\ncompelling in quite a different way. He knows the<br />\nlesson of hospitality perhaps better than does Odysseus:<br />\na suppliant himself, he was taken in by Odysseus'<br />\nparents and nurtured as if her were their son, but who<br />\n(his story implies) will now care for him in his old age?<br />\nThis is a moral imperative that suggests to Odysseus that<br />\nhis homecoming is a responsibility that must be no<br />\nlonger deferred or disguised, just as the context of<br />\nEumaios' story offers a standard of social interdependence and generosity by which this homecoming must<br />\nbe judged. For Eumaios and Odysseus together establish<br />\na small version of the just society that Odysseus must<br />\nnow seek to restore. \"These nights are endless,\" Eumaios tells Odysseus, \"and a man can sleep through<br />\nthem. Or he can enjoy listening to stories:... we two,<br />\nsitting here in the shelter, eating and drinking, shall<br />\nentertain each other with remembering and telling our<br />\nsad sorrows.\" This episode as a whole is an image of<br />\nliterary activity that can teach us much: one story that<br />\ncalls forth another, truer one, and a dialogue that in its<br />\nvery activity recovers the loss it laments. This is surely<br />\nthe kind of response that the fiction that is the Odyssey<br />\nseeks to provoke, and the context it seeks to constitute.<br />\nIt is one halfofa dialogue in which we must paritcipate,<br />\nand it reminds us that literature, and the reading of<br />\nliterature, is finally a social activity.<br />\n<br />\n\fARE YOU SLEEPING?<br />\nBROTHERJOHNZ<br />\nBY DAVID FRIEDMAN<br />\nHave you seen this year's Handbook?

Around here, it is \"uncool\" to sleep.<br />\nIf your eyelids are caught in the down position anywhere other than a chem lecture (on a good day, you<br />\ncan also get away with a quick nap at the MSE Symposium), you may as well kiss your social life goodbye.<br />\nThe oddest part of the whole situation is that<br />\ninsomnia is the least common cause of the state of<br />\nawakeness at this illustrious institution of tireless preprofessional sleep-nots. Did I say tireless? Nay. this is<br />\nnot true. The sound of two thousand people yawning<br />\nsimultaneously is frightful and Hopkins has the patent<br />\non it. This long-winded introduction now comes to a<br />\nclose as the point draws nigh where one can ask, \"So<br />\nwhy the hell is everyone staying awake?\"<br />\nAfter endless research, experimentation, and<br />\nobservation. I knew I'd be just as close to an answer<br />\nto that question as I would be if I took a wild guess. So,<br />\ndispensing with any further<br />\nformalities.

Anywhere else it would attract gawks and gasps and double<br />\nentendres. But here it is a term which commands respect<br />\nand reverence. After all, what does it mean, but \"I had<br />\nto stay up all night to finish whatever it is I had to finish<br />\nbefore the deadline this morning.\" Not only do we<br />\nhave<br />\nthat element of coolness involved in being a<br />\nawake (discussed earlier for those readers who begin<br />\narticles in the middle), but the added ingredient of<br />\nprocrastination as well. The result then is a feeling of:<br />\n\"Wow! That person really knows how to live!\" Think<br />\nabout it. The fact that this person had to stay up all<br />\nflight to finish a project means that he or she either<br />\nprocrastinated (cool in its own right) or was inundated<br />\nby other travails which kept him or her up late God<br />\nknows how many other nitthts. And that is impressive.<br />\nThree causes of Hopkins' sea of consciousness account<br />\nfor most. if not all, of non-insomniiacs insomnolence.<br />\nAcronymizing (a favorite pastime of late-night crammS.O.S.

So<br />\nyou stay up all night counting money<br />\nwhich isn't<br />\nyours, cleaning up, planning out, putting up, and tearing<br />\ndown. And as the dawn's early light catches you on<br />\nthe finishing touches, you hear the room echo with<br />\ngroans of \"Oh, God, I can't believe it's morning\" and<br />\nparenthetical yawns follow. But everyone knows how<br />\nmuch you love it. There is no logical explanation behind<br />\nit save maybe the masochistic tendencies inherent in<br />\nbeing a Hopkins student.<br />\nI hear you.

Ali, the joy of<br />\ncompleting a ten-page history paper only to start a<br />\ntwenty-page English paper immediately afterwards. Or<br />\nhow about all-nighting in the Hut, studying for a<br />\nmid-term the day after the instructor hands out the<br />\nsemester's syllabus. You think, therefore you are. I<br />\nknow a senior who once tried to eat all his meals on<br />\nSunday morning and sleep the rest of the day so that he<br />\ncould study the rest of the week without having to<br />\nworry about those superfluous functions which waste so<br />\nmuch valuable study time. Unfortunately, he forgot<br />\nabout the unsuperfluous functions and by Wednesday,<br />\nreminders of his Sunday breakfast had brought his plan<br />\nto a grinding halt.<br />\n<br />\nJoe College: Academia- it does things to a man!<br />\nNevertheless, everybody has had or will have the<br />\nincredible fortune to have too much to do in too little<br />\ntime. Like the ten-page paper due thae next day . When<br />\none falls prey to this fate, the usual explanation is:<br />\na. Tough school, man. b. I procrastinated (honest, but<br />\ndoesn't usually buy the extension). c. I work best<br />\nunder pressure. d. All of the above.<br />\nPretty soon, one becomes fairly adept at handling sleeplessness. One learns to pace oneself by the<br />\ndegree of fatigue one is feeling, by the darkness of the<br />\ncircles under one's eyes. and by the ever-diminishing<br />\nconscientiousness one feels for whatever one is doing. In<br />\naddition, one can learn to tell time by the sun --even at<br />\nnight. When the sky is its deepest black (in Baltimore,<br />\nthat's generally a hazy purple), it's midnight. At about<br />\nthree a.m.,<br />\nBaltimore's famous orange haze tints the<br />\ncloudy Charm City sky and someone who didn't know<br />\nbetter<br />\nmight swear the dawn was breaking. Between<br />\n<br />\nfive-twenty-three,<br />\nfour-thirty and<br />\ndepending on<br />\nthe season, a strip of gray will line the eastern horizon<br />\nand slowly expand westward until the sky is at its<br />\ntypical seven a.m. bleakness. For those to whom this<br />\nclockwork was unfamiliar, be appreciative. Some of us<br />\npassed many a sleepless night in order to present You<br />\nwith such a time-honored system.<br />\nOne of the strangest phenomena about allfighters is finishing. You either miss the mark and<br />\nstagger in five hours late, begging to the prof-in-waiting<br />\nfor mercy, or you finish two and a half early. Finishing<br />\nearly is a pain because at five in the morning you're not<br />\nquite sure whether two hours sleep will do more harm<br />\nthan good and there's certainly nothing better to do.<br />\nRecall those times when you've hypnotized yourself<br />\nstaring for an hour at the television code on TV while<br />\nenraptured by<br />\nthat melodic beep<br />\naccompanying<br />\nit. And how many times have you watched from your<br />\nwindow as the traffic light changes from green to yellow<br />\nto red ad nauseam? Ah, consistency.

Since switching to Arista<br />\nRecords from comatose RCA in 1976,<br />\nthey've put out a consistently strong<br />\nseries of albums - Sleepwalker, Misfits,<br />\nLow Budget, and this new live offering.<br />\nRay Davies, the group's leader,<br />\nhas always been one of rock's most<br />\ncharismatic performers, even if he has not<br />\nbeen as celebrated as Mick Jagger or<br />\nRoger Daltrey. His strong tenor was often<br />\nswamped, however, in the lavish production and arrangements the Kinks wallowed in during the early and middle '70s.<br />\nFortunately, the band seems to have<br />\nsworn off rock as Art and in the process<br />\nhas become one of the more entertaining<br />\nbands to survive from the sixties.<br />\nOn this double - disc set guitarist<br />\nDave Davies (Ray's brother) doesn't hold<br />\nback for a moment, As a matter of fact,<br />\none gets the feeling that Dave's spirit<br />\noccasionally transcends his ability (check<br />\nout the inept opening of \"You Really<br />\nGot Me\", but the rock-solid rhythm<br />\nsection of Jim Rodford on bass and Mick<br />\nAvory on drums keeps things moving.<br />\nThe songs run the gamut from their<br />\nearliest singles (\"All Day and All Night\",<br />\n\"You Really Got Me\") the their most<br />\nrecent (\"Low Budget\", \"Superman\").<br />\nThere are only a few minor problems.<br />\nThe sound mix obliterates the drummer's<br />\ncymbals, while the bass gets boosted<br />\ninto the stratosphere. There's no excuse<br />\nfor that, just as there is no justification<br />\nfor the bogus \"extra keyboard parts\"<br />\nadded by Ian Gibbons at some studio-that means overdubbing, a nasty trick on<br />\na live album.

According to Hopkins coach Henry<br />\nCiccarone, this should be the<br />\nstrongest alumni team ever, consisting of members of the last<br />\nthree championship teams, those<br />\n<br />\nof 1978, '79, and '80. The<br />\nalumni will be looking for their<br />\nfirst victory, having lost the four<br />\nprevious confrontations.<br />\nThe fall lacrosse varsity,<br />\nhoping to keep its winning<br />\nstreak alive, has been quite<br />\nimpressive in its scrimmages thus<br />\nfar. Last weekend, the Jays<br />\ndefeated a tough University of<br />\nNorth Carolina team, picked by<br />\nmany experts, along with Virginia, as a leading candidate to<br />\ndethrone Hopkins as champion.<br />\nThese two young teams, according to Ciccarone, both had<br />\nexcellent recruiting seasons.<br />\nThe biggest question for the<br />\nJays will be how to replace<br />\nAll-Americans Mike Federico<br />\n<br />\nand Mark Greenberg, the keys to<br />\nthe Jays' awesome defense of<br />\nthe past few years. Currently,<br />\nWally Kidd and Brian Holman<br />\nare battling for Federico's<br />\nvacated goalie position. Coach<br />\nCiccarone has been impressed<br />\nwith both. In addition, the<br />\nteam still has a number of<br />\nexcellent defensemen despite the<br />\nloss of Greenberg. As a result,<br />\nCiccarone again plans to employ<br />\na defensive midfield in key<br />\nsituations, in which the Jays put<br />\ntheir six best defensemen on the<br />\nfield at once.<br />\nAt midfield, the Jays lost<br />\nkey players in third-team<br />\nAll-American Wayne Davis and<br />\nBarney Fields.

Arnir Halevy, the chairman<br />\nof the Student Legal Rights<br />\nCommittee, is the chief author<br />\nof the code, which establishes<br />\nguidelines for hearing non-academic disciplinary actions. With<br />\nthe help of the University<br />\ncounsel, and using a draft which<br />\nlast year's Council worked on as<br />\na reference, Halevy will propose<br />\nthe Code to the full Council for<br />\na final vote within the next 3<br />\nweeks.<br />\nAt the Student Council<br />\nmeeting of Oct. 1, most articles<br />\nof the proposal were considered<br />\nand discussed. A non-binding<br />\nstraw vote was taken for each<br />\narticle and all those considered<br />\nwere approved. The Council will<br />\ntake a final vote on the code as a<br />\nwhole next week, once the<br />\nfreshman representatives are elected.<br />\nIf the code is approved by<br />\nthe Council, it will then be<br />\npresented to Dean Michael<br />\nHooker and Jakie Hall. According to Halevy, this will be done<br />\nin order to insure that the code<br />\nhas the support of the administration when it is finally pre-<br /><br />\nsented to the Board of Trustees,<br />\npending the approval of the<br />\nstudent body.<br />\nAt present, there is no<br />\njudicial code and therefore no<br />\nset procedures for dealing with.<br />\ncases of student misconduct.<br />\nDuring the past two years, three<br />\ndifferent proposals have been<br />\nrejected by the student body.<br />\nAccording to Halevy, one<br />\ndifference between this code and<br />\nseveral previous codes is that it is<br />\nless of a conduct code. The<br />\ncode gives any student who has a<br />\nnon-academic grievance filed<br />\nagainst him the right to choose<br /><br />\nbetween a hearing before the<br />\nDirector of Student Services, or<br />\none before the Judicial Board.<br />\nThe Judicial Board is a<br />\nCouncil<br />\nappointed<br />\nStudent<br />\ncommittee consisting of thirteen<br />\nmembers.

He is teaching<br />\ntwo seminar classes.<br />\n(interviewed by Daisy Taylor)<br />\nN-L: Is class discussion<br />\nan efficient way to bring<br />\nacross information in<br />\nyour field? Is it useful to<br />\nwhat you teach'?<br />\nHarvey: I think it depends on the kind of<br />\ninformation you want to<br />\nimpart. If there's a lot of<br />\nractual information, then<br />\nobviously class discussion<br />\n-sn't a terribly good way<br />\nto do it unless you set<br />\npeople in the class cer-:ain tasks, to get the<br />\ninformation, and then<br />\nthey come in and<br />\ngive you the information. But then there's other kinds<br />\nof information, particularly conceptual information,<br />\nideas, which is very difficult to impart except by discussion. Because we can all use a concept like neighborhood or community, we all think we know what we<br />\nmean by it. But if you have discussion it becomes very<br />\nclear that everybody has a different interpretation.<br />\nIf I talk about a concept of neighborhood, and I am<br />\ntalking all the time and everybody's interpreting it in<br />\ntheir way then there is a failure of communication.<br />\nSo I think it's very important when you're<br />\ndealing with concepts like that to discuss what they<br />\nmean, and via some kind of dialogue come to some<br />\nrange of definitions. Clearly the more directly factual<br />\nmaterial can be put across in another way, but I tend to<br />\ntake the view that people can go and read that anywhere. It seems to me the important point of class<br />\ndiscussion is to complement the kind of factual reading<br />\nwith a conceptual framework within which to interpret<br />\nthose facts.<br />\nN-L: Do you feel that the quality or ease of class<br />\ndiscussion has varied over the years or in other universities where you have taught?<br />\nHarvey: I have never figured out why the quality varies<br />\nSO much. I think part of the reason behind it is that if<br />\nyou allow a lot of class discussion and rely a lot on class<br />\ndiscussion you're never going to satisfy all the people all<br />\nof the time. There is certain sort of anarchistic tangential aspect to it ...you never know whether something is<br />\ntangential until you've followed it. You're constantly<br />\ntrying to deal with a situation in which there is a certain<br />\namount of chaos. I guess I take the view that it takes<br />\na little chaos to do anything, and personally I'd rather<br />\nlet the chaos flourish a bit and try to get something<br />\ncreative out of it than to stick with the much more<br />\nauthorian kind of lecture style.<br />\nN-L: What factors do you feel contribute to resistance<br />\non the part of students to participating in class?<br />\nHarvey: Well, there's a whole range of personal factors.<br />\nSome people feel comfortable verbalizing, some don't.<br />\nThere's a kind of tradition at certain schools; Hopkins<br />\nis kind of authoritarian in general. I think maybe<br />\nstudents here are not terribly familiar or used to the idea<br />\nof open class discussion or disagreeing with the professor<br />\nand having an argument with the professor and feeling<br />\nthat they can do that without necessarily jeopardizing<br />\ntheir grade. Under those conditions most people won't<br />\ntake on a professor and argue. The best discussions are<br />\nthose where people are going to argue because that<br />\nsharpens both sides. But there's a natural resistance to<br />\nthat and it takes a long time to get by that.<br />\nFrom the standpoint of the teacher, there's a real<br />\ndifficulty in figuring out at what point you actually<br />\nintervene. The discussion is never entirely open: there's<br />\nalways an authority there. At what point do you exert<br /><br />\nyour authority and cut a discussion off'? There's no<br />\nexact charter for saying when you should and when you<br />\nshouldn't. You play it by ear. So there's a barrier there<br />\nbecause you're always conscious and aware that even<br />\nthough it's a reasonably open discussion and the students are discussing with each other, you're still the<br />\nreserve authority.<br />\nN-L: How long have you been teaching here?<br />\nHarvey: Ten years.<br />\nN-L: Have you always been using discussion and felt it<br />\nwas important?<br />\nHarvey: I haven't given a lecture for I don't know how<br />\nlong. I don't like to operate that way, partly because I<br />\ncame here from Britain where it was all formal lecture<br />\nand there is absolutely no interaction at all with students. I think one of the things I valued about coming<br />\nhere was that I could get away from that and try to<br />\nwork in terms of class discussion, and work through<br />\nmaterial through class discussion. That has to do with<br />\nthe fact that I'm very much more interested now in<br />\ndiscussing concepts and ideas rather than factual information.<br />\nN-L: Is there anything you would like to add?<br />\nHarvey: It would be very interesting to get a very frank<br />\nappraisal from students as to how they think class<br />\ndiscussions go. I would be interested in that because I<br />\nnever get a very frank appraisal of it. I would be very<br />\nsurprised if you didn't have something like a 50%<br />\ndiscontent rate with any open discussion. But then<br />\nyou're going to get some kind of discontent rate also<br />\nwith the standard lecture format. The only difference is<br />\nthat if you have a really good lecturer who can turn in<br />\na performance and it's a sort of entertaining performance, you're entertained and you don't have to work at it<br />\nso much. But I think, particularly if the students take<br />\nthe obligation to discuss seriously, you probably end up<br />\nlearning more. Things that you are forced to discuss<br />\nreally stick with you in ways that the entertaining<br />\nlecture doesn't. One of the things I found when I moved<br />\nfrom being a student to being a teacher is that I learned<br />\nmuch more from being a teacher than I ever learned<br />\nfrom being a student. I think one of the reasons I<br />\nwanted to shift to putting some of the burden of doing<br />\nthe teaching on the students themselves is to try to make<br />\nthem learn more. Whether it works or not, who knows.<br />\nOne year you can use the same format as you used the<br />\nyear before and it's a disaster, and the year before it was<br />\nterrific.<br /><br />\nDr. Kenneth Lynn<br />\nProfessor Lynn teaches the 19th- and 20th-Century<br />\nAmerican Intellectual History courses.<br />\n(Interviewed by David Newman)<br /><br />\nN-L: Why is discussion so<br />\nimportant to what you<br />\nteach?<br />\nLynn: I'm interested in<br />\nthe comments and opinions of students, to begin<br />\nwith. I often find that<br />\nthey bring up problems<br />\nI haven't thought of.<br />\nSometimes, also, I find<br />\nthat the student or students haven't understood<br />\nthe books; in a lecture<br />\ncourse, I could go on for<br />\nhours talking at crosspurposes and not knowing what the students<br />\ndidn't understand.<br />\nAlso, it gets away from education as spectator<br />\nsport. Students are only passively encouraged by lecture<br />\ncourses or television. A discussion is useful because it<br /><br />\nallows the student to make a case.<br />\nN-L: What hinders a good discussion?<br />\nLynn: I regard the number one problem as whether or<br />\nnot students have done the reading. I assign the keeping<br />\nof a journal, in which the students make weekly entries,<br />\nas a device to get students to do the reading from<br />\nweek to week. Obviously, there is nothing less productive than a discussion on a false basis, one about which<br />\nthere is a phony quality. A professor must figure out<br />\nsome device to get students to do the reading--I use the<br />\njournal, but I'm sure there are other methods.<br />\nN-L: But what if they have done the work, and discussion has reached an impasse?<br />\nLynn: Impasse could make for a \\ ery lively discussion.<br />\nI've found a more stilted situation where the professor<br />\ndominates and one or two students Ltre the only people<br />\ntalking. A good descussion resembles some discussion<br />\nheld outside of class; the participants should be free of<br />\nthe 'you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' mentality<br />\nwhere everyone is fawning for an 'A' A good discussion<br />\nwill be a free-swinging one, full of participation, and the<br />\nprofessor should be one of many voices.<br />\nN-L: How has the quality of discussion changed from<br />\nyear to year, and have you noticed differences between<br />\nhere and Harvard (where Lynn was formerly chairman of<br />\nthe American Studies program)?<br />\nLynn: I think that the students are more conscientious<br />\nabout doing the work today. There was time when<br />\nassigning the keeping of a journal did not guarantee a<br />\ndiscussion. In the early 70's, there was still enough<br />\nanti-intellectual suspicion that students weren't doing<br />\nthe work.<br />\nAt Harvard, there were more similarities than<br />\ndifferences. A discussion course is possible with anyone\u2014an advanced graduate student or a freshman.<br />\nI suppose one difference with undergrads is a size<br />\nproblem\u2014over 25 students, and it becomes pretty<br />\nimpossible to get a sense of dialogue. Larger classes are<br />\nmore exhausting and more of a feat to pull off.<br /><br />\nDr. Richard Cone<br />\nDr. Richard Cone, a professor in the Biophysics Department, has recently taught the core curriculum biology<br />\ncourse.<br />\n(Interviewed by Walter Hook)<br />\n' I<br />\nN-L: Is class discussion<br />\nimportant to what you<br />\nteach?<br />\nCone: Almost all of my<br />\nteaching has been teaching science courses where<br />\nI'm trying to get across<br />\nwhat are key insights,<br />\npieces of information,<br />\nthat anybody interested<br />\nin<br />\nphysiology<br />\nreally<br />\nought to know, and also<br />\nthings that would help to<br />\nimprove their research.<br />\nIn that sense all of my<br />\nteaching is aimed at<br />\n6 helping someone become<br />\nlike me, a scientist. I had<br />\nlarge<br />\ngiven<br />\nalways<br />\nlecture courses, and the key thing about these courses in<br />\nterms of class discussion, was that if I were careful<br />\nenough about it in terms of not squelching questions,<br />\nand recognizing people who have their hand half way up.<br />\nor have a quizical expression what I generally got were<br />\nquestions that really helped everyone because I had been<br />\nunclear or obscure about some point. Very few students<br />\nmake points which are just irrelevant, and I know in<br />\nmy physiology course it takes several lextures before<br />\npeople begin to realize that even they can raise their<br />\nhand. They're more relaxed about it, no matter how big<br />\nthe class is.<br />\nthing than what I'd<br />\ndifferent<br />\no<br />\nverynp.<br />\na nt.o<br />\nBut thaesco<br /><br />\nCAN YOU VER1<br />\nProfessor/Student Interac<br />\ncont. from p. 9<br />\nlike to do in the core courses. I wanted to have it be a<br />\nsmall class with a lot of participation because I'd like to<br />\nexplore questions which we all share.<br />\nThe core course \u2022 investigates why certain<br />\nquestion are asked (by science) and why some are never<br />\nasked. When you try to teach science students to ask<br />\nwhy we investigate this question and not that they<br />\ncouldn't care less. \"Just tell me what we really know.\"<br />\nThe core curriculum teaches you to go back, to question. It opened up questions that shook me about what<br />\nI'm doing in the field. The students in general were not<br />\nprepared for the professors to have such different<br />\nperspectives, which left the question to the student:<br />\n\"My god the teacher isn't going to tell me what the truth<br />\nis. I must think about it myself.\" I have certain insights<br />\nwhich I'd like to sell. I also know I want to learn about<br />\nwhat life looks like to other people too. When I'm not<br />\npursuing a set body of knowledge, I think class discussion is very important, but I have a lot to learn about<br />\nhow not togive a lecture and how to stimulate the class so<br />\nthat they also want to participate.<br />\nN-L: Are there difficulties in stimulating class discussion<br />\npeculiar to this pre-professional school?<br />\nCone: Yes, I find it very difficult in both of my courses.<br />\n..At the I lopkins day school it's particularly difficult to<br />\nget a discussion off the ground. A few summers ago I<br />\ntaught at the Alumni college, and if I raised the question<br />\nthe room was off...Everyone had something to say. It<br />\ntakes a long time before the students begin to get the<br />\npicture of what's accessible to them. The norm of most<br />\nof the courses one takes at Hopkins is that the teacher<br />\nteaches you something they think you ought to know,<br />\nand you know you ought to learn it because you're<br />\ngoing to be examined on it; to come up with a remark<br />\nthat you know or you think is interesting to me, is<br />\nirrelevant. There is a lot of peer pressure to shut up:<br />\n\"Quit wasting our time, and let the expert talk.\" We are<br />\njust scientists preaching our religion. Science is so<br />\nuniversally revered as the method, the way to understand things, that a scientist, teaching science is very<br />\nmuch like a true believer. I really think that science is in<br />\nmany ways the most powerful religion around. It goes<br />\nbeyond a religion, we all believe in it, and when I teach<br />\nit It's like I'm preaching. But in pursuing a course that's<br />\naimed at questions like how we live and how might we<br />\nlive, we're all experts and we're all naive.<br />\nIn the sixties there was a lot of activism by<br />\nstudents. They had the sense of challenging the r rofessor, like \"Why are you teaching me this? Why should I learn<br />\nthis'?\" In the seventies the students come in wanting to<br />\nlearn, doing what the professor wants, and not questioning the system. The last few years there has been<br />\nquestioning again, but it has not been coining in with the<br />\nsame intensity.<br />\nIn trying to handle the issue of class<br />\nparticipation, it was very clear to me that I couldn't<br />\nput together a body of knowledge that I knew they<br />\nneeded to know. I'll talk about things I'm excited<br />\nabout, but that doesn't mean that that is what they need<br />\nto know. That's why I hit upon the idea of using papers<br />\neven in a science course. The students think of a question they are truly interested in. and I have them look<br />\ninto the literature to digest enough of it to understand it<br />\nand tell it to another person in an intelligible , interesting way. So they write the papers for each other, not<br />\nfor me.<br />\nThe writing and reading of the peer-graded.<br />\npapers worked very well. Their grade is in part determined by how you (students) evaluate that person's<br />\nwork. and that's real class participation. This leads to<br />\nan understanding of what it takes to write well. The<br />\ntrouble with class discussion when you're trying to get<br />\nacross a corpus of knowledge is that is can help to<br />\nunderstand a difficult point, but it is an inefficient<br />\nprocedure for memorizing facts. I have not figured out a<br />\nway to use discussion in physiology. Some of the TA's<br />\nhave had success in group discussion, but usually with<br />\nvery few students. That is because I took away the usual<br />\nthing which makes you go to discussion, the final exam.<br />\nso the discussion is just plain learning for you. and very<br />\nfew people come. It is very different if there is going to<br />\nbe a final exam and the discussion topics are going to be<br />\non that exam. It's been hard to make a discussion<br />\nsection so valuable that students come because they<br />\nwant to learn; because they're excited about it.<br /><br />\nWhat Hopkins is missing is a student evaluation<br />\nof teaching which is so accurate and informative that the<br />\nfaculty really are concerned with the evaluation of their Dr. Richard Macksey is the chairman of the Humanities<br />\nteaching. So to my mind, one way of really improving Department.<br />\nclass participation if through improvements in the course (Interviewed by Rob Friedman)<br />\nguids. Of course faculty members don't want to hear<br />\n_N-L: What do you think<br />\ncriticism of their teaching.

Another possible<br />\ndrawback is that seminThis is Dr. Draper's first year at Hopkins.<br />\nars are always in danger<br />\nof existing at the least<br />\n(Interviewed by Larry Park)<br />\ncommon denominator of<br />\nN-L: Is class discussion<br />\nthe group, so one of the<br />\n*important to what you<br />\nthings that makes stu' teach?<br />\ndents (and teachers,<br />\nDraper: It's important in too) impatient is that we have an awful tendency never<br />\na way.

The third thing, and this is<br />\npresentation of material, a positive point, is that seminars are probably more<br />\nand that's taking up two related to learning than to teaching. We spend perhaps<br />\nthirds of the course. I'd too much time teaching and not enough time learning.<br />\nlike the course to be half Also a student who has been taught for a long time may<br />\nlecture, half seminar.

(At the next level up, there is a<br />\ndiscussion type course where I give papers and they come problem if you look at the Socratic model; that people<br />\nin and discuss the papers, but most students in the really know each other as people; they know their names<br />\ncourse are not that advanced in this area, and need a lot the level of introductions that we have now.) The next<br />\nof background material just so they can read the litera- problem is getting the students to break out of their<br />\nture and then we can discuss it. So I present the back- molds and urging them to take some chances. The usual<br />\nground material and then what I hope happens is that we thing is that undergraduate students are afraid to take<br />\nread some original material that's current and discuss risks--you need some kind of shock discovery technique<br />\nthat.

They've already got investments madenecessary for giving the information. I've had a little -emotional investments, intellectual investments, even<br />\nbit of a hard time teaching the course so far, because I'm pedagogical investments.

If the infor-<br /><br />\nDr. Richard Macksey<br /><br />\nDr. David Draper<br /><br />\n1<br />\ni<br /><br />\nJerome McGann<br /><br />\nBALIZE ?<br /><br />\n:tion At Hopkins<br />\nmation you want to get out is large then clearly the most<br />\nefficient way to deliver the information is to lecture<br />\non it, especially if it's information that has to be acquired over a long period of time. But if the function of<br />\nthe course is to provide an environment in which people<br />\nlearn to use their own minds no matter what the material is, then you must have a class discussion. And clearly<br />\nif you have a class of fifteen people, and only two or<br />\nthree people are talking, it defeats the whole purpose of<br />\nths discussion. But with undergraduates, especially at<br />\nthis university, I increasingly see the need to have only<br />\nclass discussions. The university I came from before<br />\n(University of Chicago) was a place that encouraged<br />\nseminar class discussions from the beginning. I think<br />\nthat this is not the style of education here. It is largely<br />\nprofessor-delivered rather than interaction between<br />\nstudents overseen and guided by a professor. The reason<br />\nthat class discussion formats are useful is that in an<br />\ninteraction of different kinds of people you see your<br />\nmind as it is seen by other people, as it operates. If<br />\nyou're just thinking by yourself, working by yourself, a<br />\nprofessor for that matter, just sort of delivering to<br />\nhimself ideas that he has, there is no device for easily<br />\nobtaining a critical view of the was you are thinking,<br />\nwhat you're saying. But in a class discussion, you always<br />\nhave an environment that is continuously, dynamically<br />\ndialectical. You will find that not only are you thinking<br />\nin ways that seem perhaps odd to other people, but that<br />\nwhen you deliver the way you think, people receive it in<br />\nskewed ways. So that is becomes really important is a<br />\nclass discussion for a person to try to make their own<br />\nmind, not only clear to themselves, but to the people<br />\nthey are talking to. That is one of the principal functions in a pedagogical situation. It is especially important right here where so many people seem to work in<br />\nisolation.<br />\nN-L: Do you find in the classes you have taught here or<br />\nat Chicago that interaction naturally occurs?<br />\nMcGann: It happens here less easily than it happened at<br />\nChicago. The reason, in my opinion, is that at Chicago<br />\nwhen people come into the university, they are instantly<br />\ninvolved in various kinds of discussion groups. They are<br />\nintroduced to an environment that encourages interaction between students, and, in fact, the faculty member<br />\nis then pulled into a peculiar kind of relation with the<br />\nstudents. There's much less separation between faculty<br />\nand students at Chicago that there is at Hopkins. Not<br />\nthat people don't get along here or are not friendly, it's<br />\njust that the nature of the educational interaction is very<br />\ndifferent. Students are more deferential to faculty here<br />\nthan they are at Chicago. Not that there isn't respect at<br />\nChicago, it's just that the respect is of a different quality. There will be fewer barriers; classroom discussion<br />\nwill be much freer. Students here, for example, seem to<br />\nme to be more timid, and therefore more reluctant to<br />\nbecome involved in discussion. In order to alter the<br />\nsituation I think you'd have to introduce students at<br />\nlarge to this kind of educational method earlier, right at<br />\nthe beginning, to freshmen. Then you would see, if it<br />\nwere done in a comprehensive way, or even in a much<br />\nmore general way than it is done now, a sharp change.<br />\nOne of the reasons that there is more communication in the classroom between people at Chicago than<br />\nthere is here is because, in the first year, people who are<br />\ninvolved in Humanities there will all be reading the same<br />\ntexts. You'll have three or four hundred people all<br />\nreading at approximately the same time the History of<br />\nthe Pelopponesian Wars or the book of Genesis or War<br />\nand Peace, so that outside the classroom, you have<br />\nliterally hundreds of people wandering around all being<br />\ninvolved in the same texts. Clearly a lot of talk is going<br />\non between the students and it carries when you<br />\ncome back into the class. The class bell will ring, the<br />\nclass will be over, and the conversation will still be going<br />\non, because people have in fact incorporated this material into part of their daily lives. There is very little<br />\ncommon education at Hopkins. That also tends to break<br />\ndown the success of class discussion.<br />\nN-L: How many years have you been here?<br />\nMcGann: Five.<br />\nN-L: Since you have been here has there been any<br />\nchange in student response?<br />\nMcGann: Every other year, I try to teach a modified<br />\nversion of one of the several Freshman Humanities<br />\ncourses that I taught at Chicago. When the freshmen<br />\ncome they are a little diffident about getting involved in<br /><br />\ndiscussion. But once you get the class to have a sense of<br />\nitself it will normally turn out that the class will be<br />\nwilling to, anxious in fact, to be talking in itself, its<br />\nvarious members talking to each other, about whatever it<br />\nis that's up for discussion. Later on, when you have<br />\nclass discussions in upper level courses, the amount of<br />\ndiffidence and the difficulty of getting the students<br />\nto interact with each other seems to be much greater.<br />\nWhen I first came I taught freshmen and everything worked out well. I still see a lot of those students.<br />\nI taught freshmen last year,and I still see a lot of those<br />\nstudents too. That kind of class tends to encourage<br />\ncommunity and people getting to know each other<br />\nbecause they're talking to each other.<br />\nN-L: So the main problem with class discussion is the<br />\nway the university itself sets up education.<br />\nMcGann: Yes. I have certain ideas about what I think is<br />\nuseful for the development of a vital undergraduate<br />\neducation. Some people have other ideas. My ideas<br />\nwere formed under the influence of the undergraduate<br />\nschool at the University of Chicago.<br />\nN-L: Once you have the classroom situation, how do<br />\nyou encourage discussion? How do you bring people in<br />\nand encourage them to speak?<br />\nMcGann: There are various ways of doing this. First of<br />\nall you have to set up a course in such a way that you<br />\nforce people to be involved with each other. In the<br />\nfreshman Humanities courses I have taught here what<br />\nI've done is to have the students write a fair number of<br />\npapers during a semester or preferably a year, and then<br />\nto break down the class into groups of 5,6,or 7 people<br />\nand you meet with them in tutorial sessions that focus<br />\naround their papers on a common subject. Then in that<br />\nmuch smaller discussion group, you have people talk<br />\nabout these common subjects, and about the way other<br />\npeople have written about them. It doesn't really matter<br />\ntoo much whether the subject of your conversation is<br />\nthe rhetorical presentation of the material or the substance, the point is to get people to talk with each other<br />\nand thereby generate an atmosphere that encourages<br />\nindeed to develop that kind of<br />\ncritical thinking, and<br />\nsary if you are ever going to<br />\nnecesis<br />\nthat<br />\ngenerosity<br />\nhave real critical interaction between people, not just<br />\ncan't have criticism if<br />\nbeing destructive, in fact you<br />\nthere's that kind of hostility in .an interaction.<br />\nThere must be generosity as well as honesty. So you have to set a course up in such a way that<br />\nstudents are forced to do something that in fact ordinarily they would not do. I belive that students generally<br />\nlike to do this and find it useful pedagogically, enlightening in various kinds of ways, and even fun. In other<br />\ncourses similar techniques'have to be evolved. One that<br />\nI found very useful was to break the course down, again,<br />\ninto smaller groups. Say you have a course in Contemporary American Poetry with about 20 students in it,<br />\nyou would divide them into groups of 3 or 4 - it doesn't<br />\nreally matter - and assign them a problem, which then<br />\neach group at specified times during the course of the<br />\nyear would bring in and present to the class, let's say<br />\non the early poetry of James Merrill or something like<br />\nthat. Then you have to consult with them frequently to<br />\nfind out what they are doing, and most important of all,<br />\nyou have to make sure that when they bring their<br />\nmaterial in, they do not lecture to the class. The point<br />\nof this sort of structuring device is to get 3 or 4 people<br />\ncommunally involved themselves in a research venture<br />\noutside the classroom so that they are involved with<br />\neach other outside of class, and then bringing it in so<br />\nthat they then are faced with the problem of being<br />\ninvolved and being responsible for generating discussion<br />\nin the classroom itself. When I have done this (only<br />\nonce at Hopkins) there has been resistance and even fear.<br />\nBut I have always found that once you get over the<br />\ninitial resistance the people love it. They like to be<br />\ninvolved with other people in common pursuits and it is<br />\nvery useful pedagogically for the whole class. Then<br />\nin the classroom itself there are other sorts of ad hoc<br />\nlocal techniques. Whenever you are running a discussion<br />\nthere will be 15 people there and there will always be<br />\nsay a group of four or five who are, just by nature,<br />\nanxious to talk in those kinds of circumstances. Sometimes people like that are not at all helpful to discussion,<br />\nthey tend to kill discussion, because they want to talk all<br />\nthe time. So one of the problems in discussion classes is<br />\nshutting off people who tend to talk too much. The<br />\nother problem is encouraging people who are more<br /><br />\ndiffident to get involved. Sometimes a person is shy to<br />\nsuch a degree that you really can't do much more than<br />\nask them, force them, to deliver their share of the<br />\nresponsibility fo the class discussion, say a class presentation on a particular day. But it is possible to interrogate the class in such a way that you encourage people<br />\nto say what is on their mind. One of the problems in<br />\nclass discussion is that questions are posed in such<br />\na way, either by the teacher or by the students who are<br />\nrunning the class, that other people don't know how to<br />\nanswer the question. They're not posed correctly.<br />\nFrequently in a class discussion I'll come in and pose a<br />\nquestion and I'll look and, blank, nothing is happening.<br />\nThat means the question was posed stupidly.<br />\nAt that point you have to interrogate the question. I'll<br />\nhave posed the question that way not because I hadn't<br />\nthought it through: it seemed to me in the solitude of<br />\nmy study an important question, something that would<br />\nwork in a discussion. I'll bring it into the class and it<br />\nwill fall dead. I have to find out why. The only way to<br />\ndo that is to ask the class why they find it opaque, what<br />\nis it that is not jumping across. When you open up that<br />\nset of questions, the initial question will, I must say,find<br />\nits proper formulation. There are lots of other local<br />\ndevices of this kind What you're trying to do is not to<br />\nwant a kind of pseudo-Socratic classroom discussion, but<br />\nactually find out what it is that people in the class are<br />\ninterested in. To finally subject those questions to a<br />\ncritique is to form your opinions. There are two passages in Whitman that are great injunctions for teachers.<br />\nOne, in \"Song of Myself': \"He most honors my style<br />\nwho learns under it to destroy the teacher.\" That seems<br />\nto me a proverb that every teacher, and certainly every<br />\nstudent, should honor. There's another one a little<br />\ndown the road from that: \"He that spreads a wider<br />\nbreast than my own, proved the width of my own.\"<br />\nMy conception of class discussion and the<br />\nseminar format pivots around my sense of the importance of those two proverbs.<br /><br />\nDr. Lee Patterson<br />\nDr. Lee Patterson, of the English Department, offers his<br />\ncomments on class discussion in the context of the literature he teaches. He is currently teaching a seminar<br />\ncourse on the Epic.<br />\nMany, probably most of the contexts in which<br />\nliterary conversation takes place are, and always have<br />\nbeen, institutional, places authorized by society for just<br />\nsuch aesthetic exchanges. One thinks not just of the<br />\nclassroom but also ofthe salon, in all its historical guises,<br />\nor the Germanic or Achaian feasthall where a (preferably<br />\nblind) singer would chant the wisdom of the race. But<br />\npoets have taken pains to remind us that literature is also<br />\nable to constitute its own context, to prescribe if not to<br />\ncontrol the terms ofits own reception. Sometimes these<br />\nterms are explicitly subversive - Paolo and Francesca<br />\nseduced by Arthurian tales, Emma Bovary immersed in<br />\nromantic novels - but at other times they define a<br />\ncontext that is itself social, itself an instructive alternative to our more usual settings. An early instance occurs<br />\nin Book XV of the Odyssey. Odysseus has returned to<br />\nlthaka disguised as a Cretan exile and finds shelter with<br />\nhis swineherd Eumaios, and the two men pass the night<br />\ntelling stories. Maintaining his disguise, Odysseus begins<br />\nwith a tall tale that he fabricates in order to teach<br />\nEumaios that suppliants like him are protected by the<br />\ngods, a fact that their hosts should remember. Eumaios'<br />\nresponse - the true story of his own sufferings - is<br />\ncompelling in quite a different way. He knows the<br />\nlesson of hospitality perhaps better than does Odysseus:<br />\na suppliant himself, he was taken in by Odysseus'<br />\nparents and nurtured as if her were their son, but who<br />\n(his story implies) will now care for him in his old age?<br />\nThis is a moral imperative that suggests to Odysseus that<br />\nhis homecoming is a responsibility that must be no<br />\nlonger deferred or disguised, just as the context of<br />\nEumaios' story offers a standard of social interdependence and generosity by which this homecoming must<br />\nbe judged. For Eumaios and Odysseus together establish<br />\na small version of the just society that Odysseus must<br />\nnow seek to restore. \"These nights are endless,\" Eumaios tells Odysseus, \"and a man can sleep through<br />\nthem. Or he can enjoy listening to stories:... we two,<br />\nsitting here in the shelter, eating and drinking, shall<br />\nentertain each other with remembering and telling our<br />\nsad sorrows.\" This episode as a whole is an image of<br />\nliterary activity that can teach us much: one story that<br />\ncalls forth another, truer one, and a dialogue that in its<br />\nvery activity recovers the loss it laments. This is surely<br />\nthe kind of response that the fiction that is the Odyssey<br />\nseeks to provoke, and the context it seeks to constitute.<br />\nIt is one halfofa dialogue in which we must paritcipate,<br />\nand it reminds us that literature, and the reading of<br />\nliterature, is finally a social activity.<br /><br />\nARE YOU SLEEPING?<br />\nBROTHERJOHNZ<br />\nBY DAVID FRIEDMAN<br />\nHave you seen this year's Handbook?

The result then is a feeling of:<br />\n\"Wow! That person really knows how to live!\" Think<br />\nabout it. The fact that this person had to stay up all<br />\nflight to finish a project means that he or she either<br />\nprocrastinated (cool in its own right) or was inundated<br />\nby other travails which kept him or her up late God<br />\nknows how many other nitthts.

His strong tenor was often<br />\nswamped, however, in the lavish production and arrangements the Kinks wallowed in during the early and middle '70s.<br />\nFortunately, the band seems to have<br />\nsworn off rock as Art and in the process<br />\nhas become one of the more entertaining<br />\nbands to survive from the sixties.<br />\nOn this double - disc set guitarist<br />\nDave Davies (Ray's brother) doesn't hold<br />\nback for a moment, As a matter of fact,<br />\none gets the feeling that Dave's spirit<br />\noccasionally transcends his ability (check<br />\nout the inept opening of \"You Really<br />\nGot Me\", but the rock-solid rhythm<br />\nsection of Jim Rodford on bass and Mick<br />\nAvory on drums keeps things moving.<br />\nThe songs run the gamut from their<br />\nearliest singles (\"All Day and All Night\",<br />\n\"You Really Got Me\") the their most<br />\nrecent (\"Low Budget\", \"Superman\").<br />\nThere are only a few minor problems.<br />\nThe sound mix obliterates the drummer's<br />\ncymbals, while the bass gets boosted<br />\ninto the stratosphere. There's no excuse<br />\nfor that, just as there is no justification<br />\nfor the bogus \"extra keyboard parts\"<br />\nadded by Ian Gibbons at some studio-that means overdubbing, a nasty trick on<br />\na live album.

Currently,<br />\nWally Kidd and Brian Holman<br />\nare battling for Federico's<br />\nvacated goalie position. Coach<br />\nCiccarone has been impressed<br />\nwith both. In addition, the<br />\nteam still has a number of<br />\nexcellent defensemen despite the<br />\nloss of Greenberg. As a result,<br />\nCiccarone again plans to employ<br />\na defensive midfield in key<br />\nsituations, in which the Jays put<br />\ntheir six best defensemen on the<br />\nfield at once.<br />\nAt midfield, the Jays lost<br />\nkey players in third-team<br />\nAll-American Wayne Davis and<br />\nBarney Fields.
