Any anti-war<br />\ndemonstration is given good publicity. He expressed fear, however, that such publicity might<br />\nserve only to cement opinion<br />\nagainst the aims of the demonstrators.<br />\nDr. Brick further said that he<br />\ndoes not believe 'that America<br />\nhas ever engaged in war-making<br />\nin so depraved a manner as it is<br />\npresently engaged in Vietnam. He<br />\nsaid that there might be a tendency on the part of the governmental bureaucracy to try to<br />\njustify itself by conducting such<br />\na war.<br />\nObjection of Youth<br />\nBroaching the main topic of<br />\n<br />\nALAN BRICK<br />\nhis address, the draft and conscientious objection, he said that<br />\nconscientious objectors were becoming more numerous, with one<br />\nCO for every 400 men ordered to<br />\nreport for induction. He attributed this at least in part to the<br />\ngrowing objection of middle class<br />\nyouth to service in Vietnam.<br />\nHe further stated that the government was seeking to counter<br />\nthis growing opposition by hints<br />\nof alternative service in the Peace<br />\nCorps or VISTA.<br />\nHe believed, however, that the<br />\nvast majority of middle class<br />\nAmerica was not willing to stand<br />\nup for its principles to the extent<br />\nof going to jail.

Hopkins was hampered by the absence of Pablo<br />\nDrobny, the team's high scorer,<br />\nand defensive starters Roger<br />\nPurdom and Stu Hogdson. Hodgson suffered a torn thigh muscle<br />\nand is out for the season.<br />\nCoach Gary Barrette shuffled his players in an attempt<br />\nto make up for the losses as<br />\nhe shifted Dave Rockwell to<br />\nhalfback and put Ken Torrington<br />\nin Rockwell's fullback spot. But<br />\nhe could not help the Bluejays<br />\nscore. They all played well, but<br />\nmissed their chances to score<br />\nwhen they took eight shots in<br />\nthe first period without any hitting.<br />\nThen with only a minute and<br />\na half left, in the first period,<br />\nDrexel scored two goals and the<br />\ngame was over. Hopkins was outshot 17-15, but hustled most of<br />\nthe game until they tired in the<br />\nlast period.<br />\nThe Drexel goalie made some<br />\nspectacular saves to keep the<br />\nBluejays from scoring. Soph Carl<br />\nAhrendt started in place of<br />\nDrobny, and showed poise and<br />\ngood play.<br />\nTuesday the Jays traveled to<br />\n<br />\nWestern Maryland looking for a<br />\nvictory. This time co-captain<br />\nDrobny was able to play and he<br />\nsparked Hopkins to a 5-2 win,<br />\nbringing their season record to<br />\nthree victories and six losses. The<br />\ndefense was tight and played another fine game as they have<br />\nshown continual improvement<br />\nfrom mid-season on.<br />\nOn offense, Drobny kicked two<br />\ngoaLs, making that thirteen for<br />\nthe season. Wes Bachur had his<br />\nbest day of the year, also scoring two goals. Scoring number<br />\nfive, sophomore Art Guerin got<br />\nhis first goal of the season.<br />\nGuerin, the high sewer on last<br />\nyear's freshmen team, has been<br />\na starter all season, and has<br />\nplayed well throughout. He<br />\nscored Tuesday on a header from<br />\na corner kick.<br />\nA Better Half<br />\nBarrette has high hopes for<br />\ntomorrow's game against Dickinson. He feels that if the Bluejays can win tomorrow, then<br />\ntheir season would be more successful than their record shows.<br />\nThey would have won four out<br />\nof their last five games after<br />\ntheir 0-5 start.<br />\nDickinson is 2-7 on the year,<br />\nbut is much better than its record. They lost several close<br />\ngames to good teams. For comparison, Dickinson beat Washington College 5-1, while Hopkins won by a score of 4-1. Both<br />\nteams should be evenly matched.<br />\nwith a good battle in the making.,<br />\n<br />\n...\"'' ''......<br />\n<br />\nGO AS FAR AS YOU LIKE<br />\nWITH<br />\n<br />\nq118,0406360<br />\nKnow what you'll like about Passport 360<br />\nby Van Heusen?

Any anti-war<br />\ndemonstration is given good publicity. He expressed fear, however, that such publicity might<br />\nserve only to cement opinion<br />\nagainst the aims of the demonstrators.<br />\nDr. Brick further said that he<br />\ndoes not believe 'that America<br />\nhas ever engaged in war-making<br />\nin so depraved a manner as it is<br />\npresently engaged in Vietnam.

He attributed this at least in part to the<br />\ngrowing objection of middle class<br />\nyouth to service in Vietnam.<br />\nHe further stated that the government was seeking to counter<br />\nthis growing opposition by hints<br />\nof alternative service in the Peace<br />\nCorps or VISTA.<br />\nHe believed, however, that the<br />\nvast majority of middle class<br />\nAmerica was not willing to stand<br />\nup for its principles to the extent<br />\nof going to jail.

Wyatt is considered America's pre-eminent realist painter, and perhaps the<br />\nmost popular of America's living artists.<br />\nWyeth is almost always classified as a realist, though he may<br />\nnot describe himself as such. His<br />\npaintings are representational,<br />\nthat is, the objects are recognizable and familiar\u2014people, boats<br />\nanimals, windows, landscape\u2014<br />\nbut what he does with color,<br />\ncomposition and his own creative<br />\nexpression may not go down in<br />\nart history as pure realism.<br />\nAgnes Mongan of the Fogg<br />\nArt Museum, an authoritative<br />\ncritic of Wyeth, wrote in a recent<br />\npublication about him: \"As is<br />\ntrue of every real artist, his preference and use saf color is deeply<br />\npersonal, again often with symbolic overtones. He loves the<br />\ncolors of dry grass and of fresh<br />\ngrass, and the russet of autumn<br />\nleaves, 'the dusty beauty' of a<br />\nwinter beehive, olive-greens and<br />\nmustardy yellows, the contrast<br />\nof silvery and golden tones, and<br />\nover and over, or more than a<br />\nnote, of blue: the faded, worn<br />\nblue of an old denim coat, a<br />\nblue measure, a blue scale, a<br />\nblue mussel shell, a patch of blue<br />\nwater, a bit of blue sky, or a box<br /><br />\nor two of blueberries.<br />\n\"In the best sense of the<br />\nword, Andrew Wyeth is a regional artist, for the scenes he<br />\ndraws and paints are chosen<br />\nfrom two regions he knows and<br />\nloves so well. But in the last<br />\nanalysis the drawings and paintings are no more regional than<br />\nthe seasons themselves and the<br />\neffects these seasons have on the<br />\nlives of those who live in and<br />\nthrough them.\"<br />\nMany of the best paintings by<br />\nWyeth will be shown in the<br />\nforthcoming exhibition, including \"Maga's Daughter\", 1966,<br />\nlent by the artist; \"The Mill\",<br />\n1958, lent by Mrs. Andrew Wyeth; \"Four Poster\", 1946, lent by<br />\nMr. and Mrs. Roger Milliken of<br />\nSouth Carolina; \"Young America\", 1950, lent by the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts;<br />\n\"Grape Wine\", 1966, lent by M.<br />\nKnoedler and Company, New<br />\nYork; and \"The Slip\", 1958, lent<br />\nby Mrs. Andrew Wyeth.<br />\nAltogether, some 200 paintings<br />\nand drawings will be shown,<br />\ndrawn from museums and private collections around America.<br />\nAn admission charge of $1.00<br />\nto the Wyeth exhibition areas<br />\nwill be made; general admission<br />\nto the rest of the museum will be<br />\nfree as always.<br />\nAn informative and handsomely illustrated catalogue on the<br />\nexhibition is available for purchase at the museum. In the introduction to the catalogue, the<br />\nDirector of the Pennsylvania<br />\nAcademy of Fine Arts, Joseph T.<br />\nFraser, Jr., states: \"After more<br />\nthan half a century of art built<br />\non a rejection of nature, our age<br />\nis not well equipped to underStand the painter's use of imaginative observation.<br /><br />\n\"THAT UPON WHICH folk wisdom4<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br /><br />\ncommon sense, and philosophical<br />\ndemonstration have always agreed<br />\nremains the verdict of reality: men<br />\nare unequal\u2014unequal in intelligence,<br />\nin ability, in vigor, in moral stamina.<br />\nSo now we pass to a new stage<br />\nof egalitarianism.

Hopkins was hampered by the absence of Pablo<br />\nDrobny, the team's high scorer,<br />\nand defensive starters Roger<br />\nPurdom and Stu Hogdson. Hodgson suffered a torn thigh muscle<br />\nand is out for the season.<br />\nCoach Gary Barrette shuffled his players in an attempt<br />\nto make up for the losses as<br />\nhe shifted Dave Rockwell to<br />\nhalfback and put Ken Torrington<br />\nin Rockwell's fullback spot. But<br />\nhe could not help the Bluejays<br />\nscore. They all played well, but<br />\nmissed their chances to score<br />\nwhen they took eight shots in<br />\nthe first period without any hitting.<br />\nThen with only a minute and<br />\na half left, in the first period,<br />\nDrexel scored two goals and the<br />\ngame was over. Hopkins was outshot 17-15, but hustled most of<br />\nthe game until they tired in the<br />\nlast period.<br />\nThe Drexel goalie made some<br />\nspectacular saves to keep the<br />\nBluejays from scoring. Soph Carl<br />\nAhrendt started in place of<br />\nDrobny, and showed poise and<br />\ngood play.<br />\nTuesday the Jays traveled to<br /><br />\nWestern Maryland looking for a<br />\nvictory. This time co-captain<br />\nDrobny was able to play and he<br />\nsparked Hopkins to a 5-2 win,<br />\nbringing their season record to<br />\nthree victories and six losses. The<br />\ndefense was tight and played another fine game as they have<br />\nshown continual improvement<br />\nfrom mid-season on.<br />\nOn offense, Drobny kicked two<br />\ngoaLs, making that thirteen for<br />\nthe season. Wes Bachur had his<br />\nbest day of the year, also scoring two goals. Scoring number<br />\nfive, sophomore Art Guerin got<br />\nhis first goal of the season.<br />\nGuerin, the high sewer on last<br />\nyear's freshmen team, has been<br />\na starter all season, and has<br />\nplayed well throughout. He<br />\nscored Tuesday on a header from<br />\na corner kick.<br />\nA Better Half<br />\nBarrette has high hopes for<br />\ntomorrow's game against Dickinson. He feels that if the Bluejays can win tomorrow, then<br />\ntheir season would be more successful than their record shows.<br />\nThey would have won four out<br />\nof their last five games after<br />\ntheir 0-5 start.<br />\nDickinson is 2-7 on the year,<br />\nbut is much better than its record. They lost several close<br />\ngames to good teams. For comparison, Dickinson beat Washington College 5-1, while Hopkins won by a score of 4-1. Both<br />\nteams should be evenly matched.<br />\nwith a good battle in the making.,<br /><br />\n...\"'' ''......<br /><br />\nGO AS FAR AS YOU LIKE<br />\nWITH<br /><br />\nq118,0406360<br />\nKnow what you'll like about Passport 360<br />\nby Van Heusen?
