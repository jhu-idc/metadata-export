The improvement in general team play<br />\nover that displayed in previous<br />\ngames was distinctly encouraging.<br />\nIndividually the men played with<br />\nmore assurance and for the first<br />\ntime this season we saw indications<br />\nof concerted efforts, both on attack<br />\nand defence. The improvement was<br />\nmost gratifying in view of the<br />\nmany enforced changes in the lineup.<br />\nWhen coaches are reduced to the<br />\nnecessity of making back field men<br />\nout of centre and tackle material<br />\nat a week's notice, we must not expect too much in the way of finished<br />\nexecution. Much has to be done<br />\nin the involved game of today, and<br />\nlittle time is available for the doing.<br />\nWe are not entirely satisfied with<br />\nthe work of the men who played,<br />\nbut a word of praise is due them.<br />\nThe attack showed more positiveness and considerable power. If<br />\nwe can hold the present team together for three weeks more, further improvement should be manifested.<br />\nBarring two occasions<br />\nwhen a cleverly executed shift<br />\nfooled the line men, the defensive<br />\nline play was excellent. Gettysburg<br />\nhad a good team. The backs came<br />\nhard and fast. We have to thank<br />\nour line men for stopping their<br />\nprogress.

Once this<br />\nspirit gets started we are bound to<br />\nimprove. There is probably nothing more satisfying to a normal<br />\nman playing football than the feeling that he has cleaned up the interference or made a good tackle.<br />\nIt even beats carrying the ball, for<br />\nthe reason that he knows he has<br />\nstopped the other fellow.<br />\nMuch remains to be done in the<br />\ndevelopment of the team.

M. C. A. CHAPEL SERVICES<br />\nDRAW LARGER ATTENDANCE<br />\n<br />\nThe organization of the Bible<br />\nclasses of the University Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association are<br />\nrapidly nearing completion. Dr.<br />\nSwartz's class in \"The Difficulties<br />\nof the Bible,\" which has held several meetings at one o'clock on<br />\nThursdays, has a membership of<br />\nmore than twenty men. Dr.<br />\nHogue's class meets also on Thursdays at one o'clock. Mr. Addison's<br />\nclass meets on Thursdays at 1.15<br />\no'clock. The freshman class is<br />\ndivided into two sections, one of<br />\nwhich meets on Fridays at one<br />\no'clock. The other holds its meetings at ten o'clock on Thursdays.<br />\nA general invitation is still extended by the Association to every<br />\nmember of the University to join<br />\none of these classes.<br />\nThe attendance at the chapel<br />\nservices has been very encouraging,<br />\nperhaps more so than that of the<br />\nprevious year. The Association,<br />\nhowever, is striving to increase<br />\nthe interest of the student body in<br />\nthese religious meetings. Dr. Ferris<br />\nof Mount Vernon Place M. E.<br />\nChurch was leader last week. His<br />\nservices were unusually edifying.<br />\nThe Association feels a deep gratitude to all those who, like Dr. Ferris, have consented to conduct the<br />\nservices. A quartet will lead the<br />\nsinging from now on. This musical addition has been a new feature<br />\nduring the last couple of weeks.<br />\nDr. J. H. Latane is leader for<br />\nthis week.<br />\nMr. Willis, a graduate student,<br />\n'who has charge of a class in English at the City Jail, gave a very<br />\ninteresting report of the work.<br />\nThere are more than thirty men in<br />\nhis class, which includes mostly illiterates and foreigners. In a general way they may be divided into<br />\nfour groups: those who do not<br />\nknow the English alphabet; those<br />\nwho can read, but cannot spell;<br />\nthose who can spell, but cannot<br />\nread; and, finally, those who have<br />\nonly a limited knowledge of spelling and reading. Mr. Willis finds<br />\nthe method of instruction very<br />\nsimple, and emphasizes the fact<br />\nthat the work is very interesting<br />\nand instructive. For, example, he<br />\nfinds a peculiar satisfaction and<br />\npleasure in observing the progress<br />\nof the members of his class from<br />\nlesson to \u201elesson.<br />\nThe organization of similar classes<br />\nat the Fayette Street M.

In<br />\nreply, it may be pointed out that<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is, as its name<br />\nindicates, a paper devoted primarily<br />\nto college news. Its editors are<br />\ncharged with the duty of collecting<br />\nand publishing facts concerning the<br />\nactivities and problems in which the<br />\nHopkins undergraduates are engaged. To transgress into the field<br />\nof the magazine, then, is not strictly<br />\nin accordance with the function and<br />\npolicy of the paper. The Lanier<br />\narticles were published because<br />\nthere was news value in the fact<br />\nthat it was just 35 years ago that<br />\nthe poet came to Hopkins.<br />\nWe believe, however, that occasional articles similar to those on<br />\nLanier would help toward a better<br />\nknowledge of the University and<br />\nof the men who made its past a brilliant one, and we shall present from<br />\ntime to time a \"magazine page\" of<br />\nstories of the men who figured in<br />\nthe establishment and building up<br />\nof the University.<br />\nThe discussion raised by the letters we received brings out the facts<br />\nthat Hopkins is without a student<br />\n<br />\nmagazine and that it has no memorial society.<br />\nPrinceton, Harvard, Yale, Boston \"Tech\" and a number of the<br />\ncolleges with larger student bodies<br />\nhave monthly magazines devoted to<br />\narticles of a literary nature which<br />\ncan not rightly be printed in their<br />\ncollege newspapers. Of course, a<br />\nlarge student body and a host of<br />\nloyal alumni are needed for the support of such an enterprise, and only<br />\nthose colleges having students and<br />\ngraduates numbering in the thousands can issue such a book. It is<br />\nperhaps too early yet for Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates to attempt such a<br />\npublication, but it is an activity that<br />\nwe believe will flourish in years to<br />\ncome. Imagine The Homewood<br />\nMagazine! Happy the men who<br />\nwill be its editors!<br />\nBut if Hopkins can not have a<br />\nmagazine, it can have a society of<br />\nthose students who are slightly or<br />\nwholly antiquarian\u2014students who<br />\nwant to keep bright and untarnished<br />\nthe memory of the men who conceived and launched the Universit)<br />\nand of those who have been distinguished figures in its history.<br />\nThis would be a memorial society.<br />\nIt could hold monthly meetings at<br />\nwhich papers could be read on<br />\nJohns Hopkins, Gilman, Lanier,<br />\nSylvester, Rowland and other members of the early faculty. The<br />\nmeetings could be addressed by<br />\nmen who knew Hopkins, Lanier,<br />\nGilman and the other leaders in the<br />\nearly University. A true Hopkins<br />\nspirit includes some detailed knowledge of these men.<br />\nMembership should be open to<br />\nall students paying a small due, and<br />\nthe accumulation of these dues<br />\ncould be devoted to the preservation.<br />\nof the papers, libraries and other<br />\npertinent effects of the old faculty'<br />\nand to the erection of memorials.<br />\nOf course, the society could not<br />\ndo much in its earlier years. It<br />\nwould have to have prestige (which<br />\nmeans age) before it could be influential. And would it not be appropriate to make this pioneer start<br />\nnow\u2014just at a time when the University is leaving the buildings<br />\nwhich housed it from its founding<br />\nin 1876? The new site on the<br />\nbright, large estate at Homewood<br />\nwill soon cause the old buildings to<br />\nbe forgotten, and there should be<br />\nsome means of preserving in photograph and in story the old associations, so that in generations to come<br />\nsomething definite and complete<br />\nwill be known about the old University. A hundred years from<br />\nnow loyal sons of Hopkins will<br />\nwant to know about the buildings<br />\non Monument street. And another<br />\ncause in which the society could interest itself would be the erection<br />\nof a stone on the grave of Sidney<br />\nLanier in Greenmount Cemetery,<br />\nand the placing of a larger memorial to him in the University.<br />\nIt would certainly not be improper to organize such a society<br />\nnow, so that the next generation<br />\nof students may enjoy an established prestige which will be made<br />\nin the next few years.<br />\n<br />\nAn ideal activity in a future genTIIE NEWS-LETTER does not beeration of Johns Hopkins' history lieve that freshmen will not support<br />\nwill be a Memorial Society with a the activities when time for actual<br />\nmagazine for its official organ. support comes.

CATES.<br /><br />\nHopkins was unable to defeat<br />\nGettysburg on Saturday, but all<br />\nthings considered, the team played<br />\ncommendable football. The improvement in general team play<br />\nover that displayed in previous<br />\ngames was distinctly encouraging.<br />\nIndividually the men played with<br />\nmore assurance and for the first<br />\ntime this season we saw indications<br />\nof concerted efforts, both on attack<br />\nand defence. The improvement was<br />\nmost gratifying in view of the<br />\nmany enforced changes in the lineup.<br />\nWhen coaches are reduced to the<br />\nnecessity of making back field men<br />\nout of centre and tackle material<br />\nat a week's notice, we must not expect too much in the way of finished<br />\nexecution. Much has to be done<br />\nin the involved game of today, and<br />\nlittle time is available for the doing.<br />\nWe are not entirely satisfied with<br />\nthe work of the men who played,<br />\nbut a word of praise is due them.<br />\nThe attack showed more positiveness and considerable power. If<br />\nwe can hold the present team together for three weeks more, further improvement should be manifested.<br />\nBarring two occasions<br />\nwhen a cleverly executed shift<br />\nfooled the line men, the defensive<br />\nline play was excellent. Gettysburg<br />\nhad a good team. The backs came<br />\nhard and fast. We have to thank<br />\nour line men for stopping their<br />\nprogress. The Hopkins back field<br />\nmen did some wretched tackling.<br />\nHowever, they know their weakness and they will overcome this<br />\nwith a little practice.<br />\nAs I have said before, we can't<br />\nexpect line men to adapt themselves at once to backfield play.<br />\nWhat we like most of all about that<br />\ngame was the change in the mental<br />\nattitude of the men toward the game.<br />\nThey are beginning to find themselves and to enjoy the game for<br />\nthe sake of the game. Once this<br />\nspirit gets started we are bound to<br />\nimprove. There is probably nothing more satisfying to a normal<br />\nman playing football than the feeling that he has cleaned up the interference or made a good tackle.<br />\nIt even beats carrying the ball, for<br />\nthe reason that he knows he has<br />\nstopped the other fellow.<br />\nMuch remains to be done in the<br />\ndevelopment of the team.

M. C. A. CHAPEL SERVICES<br />\nDRAW LARGER ATTENDANCE<br /><br />\nThe organization of the Bible<br />\nclasses of the University Young<br />\nMen's Christian Association are<br />\nrapidly nearing completion. Dr.<br />\nSwartz's class in \"The Difficulties<br />\nof the Bible,\" which has held several meetings at one o'clock on<br />\nThursdays, has a membership of<br />\nmore than twenty men. Dr.<br />\nHogue's class meets also on Thursdays at one o'clock. Mr. Addison's<br />\nclass meets on Thursdays at 1.15<br />\no'clock. The freshman class is<br />\ndivided into two sections, one of<br />\nwhich meets on Fridays at one<br />\no'clock. The other holds its meetings at ten o'clock on Thursdays.<br />\nA general invitation is still extended by the Association to every<br />\nmember of the University to join<br />\none of these classes.<br />\nThe attendance at the chapel<br />\nservices has been very encouraging,<br />\nperhaps more so than that of the<br />\nprevious year. The Association,<br />\nhowever, is striving to increase<br />\nthe interest of the student body in<br />\nthese religious meetings. Dr. Ferris<br />\nof Mount Vernon Place M. E.<br />\nChurch was leader last week. His<br />\nservices were unusually edifying.<br />\nThe Association feels a deep gratitude to all those who, like Dr. Ferris, have consented to conduct the<br />\nservices. A quartet will lead the<br />\nsinging from now on. This musical addition has been a new feature<br />\nduring the last couple of weeks.<br />\nDr. J. H. Latane is leader for<br />\nthis week.<br />\nMr. Willis, a graduate student,<br />\n'who has charge of a class in English at the City Jail, gave a very<br />\ninteresting report of the work.<br />\nThere are more than thirty men in<br />\nhis class, which includes mostly illiterates and foreigners. In a general way they may be divided into<br />\nfour groups: those who do not<br />\nknow the English alphabet; those<br />\nwho can read, but cannot spell;<br />\nthose who can spell, but cannot<br />\nread; and, finally, those who have<br />\nonly a limited knowledge of spelling and reading. Mr. Willis finds<br />\nthe method of instruction very<br />\nsimple, and emphasizes the fact<br />\nthat the work is very interesting<br />\nand instructive. For, example, he<br />\nfinds a peculiar satisfaction and<br />\npleasure in observing the progress<br />\nof the members of his class from<br />\nlesson to \u201elesson.<br />\nThe organization of similar classes<br />\nat the Fayette Street M.

A friend<br />\nof mine has sent me the following<br />\nfrom London:<br />\nWhan that the Kiser and his Bisy Bertha<br />\nWith heeps of deed have covered al the<br />\nerthe,<br />\nAnd everich veyne doth flow with raging<br />\nblood,<br />\nEnough to mak an honest yoman wood,\u2014<br />\nWhan Boreas eke with his colde breeth<br />\nY-frozen bath on every bolt and heeth<br />\nThe rawe recruites, and the only sonne<br />\nOf mony a moder bath his spurs y-wonne, .<br />\nWhyl bolde fooles maken war-copye<br />\nTo sellen for a monthly salarye,\u2014<br />\n(This is to seyn, they ernen humble gage<br />\nBy sending dope for many a lying page,)<br />\nThan longen plaine folk for pryces lowe<br />\n(For meet is hyer, as ye ful wel knowe,)<br />\nAnd eke right plaine the sentence that I<br />\nmene is,\u2014<br />\nTheir hertes pinen for some pork and benes,<br />\nOr many anothre dishe that they did love<br />\nBefore thise sely prices Bored above.<br />\n0 cursed prices, welles of iniquitee<br />\nThou movest wrong, lyke primum mobile,<br />\nAnd forcest us the olde sawe to telle,\u2014<br />\nHow Sherman sayde y-wis that war was<br />\nbelle.<br /><br />\nYours,<br />\nGEOFFREY.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nA Suggestion for The News-Letter.<br /><br />\nNovember 6, 1914.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR\u2014I have long thought that<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER could become<br />\nfar more useful than it now is if,<br />\ndeparting a bit from its policy, it<br />\nwould devote more space to articles<br />\nlike that on Sidney Lanier, or, if<br />\nI may be permitted to say so, to<br />\nother things besides freshman class<br />\nmeetings, appeals for support to<br />\nthe Musical Clubs and football<br />\nstories.<br />\nIn 'the last issue a letter from<br />\nMr. Charles A. Bastin expresses<br />\nthis view, and it is for the purpose<br />\nof elaborating on it that I am now<br />\nwriting.<br />\nFirst of all, I want to make it<br />\nclear that I agree that all stories of<br />\nstudent activities should be printed<br />\nin full. THE NEWS-LETTER is an<br />\nundergraduate organ, and I do not<br />\ndesire that a whit less prominence<br />\nbe given to articles devoted to the<br />\nstudent affairs..<br />\nBut I believe that there are a<br />\ngreat many subscribers who desire<br />\nsomething further. They want to<br />\nknow a little of what is going on<br />\nin the seminaries; they are interested in research problems being conducted by graduate students, and<br />\nthey would like to hear the views<br />\nof members of the faculty on current subjects from time to time.<br />\nThe article on Sidney Lanier was<br />\na step in the right direction, and I<br />\nsuggest that there be similar ones<br />\nin coming issues.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nSENOR GUREZ.<br />\n[If the seminaries would allow a campus<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nWednesday, November 11<br />\n4 P.

In<br />\nreply, it may be pointed out that<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER is, as its name<br />\nindicates, a paper devoted primarily<br />\nto college news. Its editors are<br />\ncharged with the duty of collecting<br />\nand publishing facts concerning the<br />\nactivities and problems in which the<br />\nHopkins undergraduates are engaged. To transgress into the field<br />\nof the magazine, then, is not strictly<br />\nin accordance with the function and<br />\npolicy of the paper. The Lanier<br />\narticles were published because<br />\nthere was news value in the fact<br />\nthat it was just 35 years ago that<br />\nthe poet came to Hopkins.<br />\nWe believe, however, that occasional articles similar to those on<br />\nLanier would help toward a better<br />\nknowledge of the University and<br />\nof the men who made its past a brilliant one, and we shall present from<br />\ntime to time a \"magazine page\" of<br />\nstories of the men who figured in<br />\nthe establishment and building up<br />\nof the University.<br />\nThe discussion raised by the letters we received brings out the facts<br />\nthat Hopkins is without a student<br /><br />\nmagazine and that it has no memorial society.<br />\nPrinceton, Harvard, Yale, Boston \"Tech\" and a number of the<br />\ncolleges with larger student bodies<br />\nhave monthly magazines devoted to<br />\narticles of a literary nature which<br />\ncan not rightly be printed in their<br />\ncollege newspapers. Of course, a<br />\nlarge student body and a host of<br />\nloyal alumni are needed for the support of such an enterprise, and only<br />\nthose colleges having students and<br />\ngraduates numbering in the thousands can issue such a book. It is<br />\nperhaps too early yet for Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates to attempt such a<br />\npublication, but it is an activity that<br />\nwe believe will flourish in years to<br />\ncome. Imagine The Homewood<br />\nMagazine! Happy the men who<br />\nwill be its editors!<br />\nBut if Hopkins can not have a<br />\nmagazine, it can have a society of<br />\nthose students who are slightly or<br />\nwholly antiquarian\u2014students who<br />\nwant to keep bright and untarnished<br />\nthe memory of the men who conceived and launched the Universit)<br />\nand of those who have been distinguished figures in its history.<br />\nThis would be a memorial society.<br />\nIt could hold monthly meetings at<br />\nwhich papers could be read on<br />\nJohns Hopkins, Gilman, Lanier,<br />\nSylvester, Rowland and other members of the early faculty. The<br />\nmeetings could be addressed by<br />\nmen who knew Hopkins, Lanier,<br />\nGilman and the other leaders in the<br />\nearly University. A true Hopkins<br />\nspirit includes some detailed knowledge of these men.<br />\nMembership should be open to<br />\nall students paying a small due, and<br />\nthe accumulation of these dues<br />\ncould be devoted to the preservation.<br />\nof the papers, libraries and other<br />\npertinent effects of the old faculty'<br />\nand to the erection of memorials.<br />\nOf course, the society could not<br />\ndo much in its earlier years. It<br />\nwould have to have prestige (which<br />\nmeans age) before it could be influential. And would it not be appropriate to make this pioneer start<br />\nnow\u2014just at a time when the University is leaving the buildings<br />\nwhich housed it from its founding<br />\nin 1876? The new site on the<br />\nbright, large estate at Homewood<br />\nwill soon cause the old buildings to<br />\nbe forgotten, and there should be<br />\nsome means of preserving in photograph and in story the old associations, so that in generations to come<br />\nsomething definite and complete<br />\nwill be known about the old University. A hundred years from<br />\nnow loyal sons of Hopkins will<br />\nwant to know about the buildings<br />\non Monument street. And another<br />\ncause in which the society could interest itself would be the erection<br />\nof a stone on the grave of Sidney<br />\nLanier in Greenmount Cemetery,<br />\nand the placing of a larger memorial to him in the University.<br />\nIt would certainly not be improper to organize such a society<br />\nnow, so that the next generation<br />\nof students may enjoy an established prestige which will be made<br />\nin the next few years.<br /><br />\nAn ideal activity in a future genTIIE NEWS-LETTER does not beeration of Johns Hopkins' history lieve that freshmen will not support<br />\nwill be a Memorial Society with a the activities when time for actual<br />\nmagazine for its official organ. support comes.
