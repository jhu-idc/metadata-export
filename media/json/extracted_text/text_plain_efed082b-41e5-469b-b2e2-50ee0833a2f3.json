Jim Archibald,one of<br />\nthe principal student organizers, stressed his \"hesitancy over ever dealing with<br />\nthe administration again.\"<br />\nAs a result of the work done by Manuel<br />\nRodriguez and Jim Archibald, both Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates,<br />\nLincoln<br />\nand<br />\nGordon, Noam Chomsky, professor of<br />\nlinguistics at M.I.T., Herbert Dinerstein,<br />\nprofessor at the Hopkins School of International Studies, W. Averell Harriman,<br />\nsenior career diplomat and former governor of New York, and Lincoln Gordon<br />\nwill participate in a panel discussion in<br />\nShriver Hall at 8 p.m. tonight.<br />\nDr. Gordon first approached Rodriguez<br />\non October 26 with the idea of a panel<br />\ndiscussion around the time of the Novem -<br />\n<br />\nber moratorium, on \"how to get out of<br />\nVietnam.\" Dr. Gordon envisioned the<br />\ndiscussion as one on a high intellectual<br />\nlevel and presenting various points of<br />\nview on the war. Dr. Gordon felt that this<br />\nbalance had been lacking at the October<br />\nMoratorium Teach-In.<br />\nIn the following week it was decided<br />\nthat the Student Association would sponsor the panel, and that both the students<br />\nand the administrationwould each submit<br />\na list of possible speakers for the panel.<br />\nThe next week, Frederick DeKuyper,<br />\nExecutive Assistant to the president,<br />\nsubmitted to the students the names of<br />\nthree SAIS professors. The student organizers indicated that they were thinking<br />\nalong the lines of Professor Richard<br />\nPfeffer of Political Science, but hadn't<br />\nyet drawn up any list.<br />\nOn Tuesday the 4th, the panelwas tentatively decided for Wednesday (Nov 12),<br />\nwith Dinnerstein, Harriman,and Pfeffer.<br />\nNone of the speakers had been confirmed<br />\nat this time. Governor Harrimanwas included in the panel when Rodriguez stressed the necessity of having a \"drawing<br />\ncard\" or major speaker to attract the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe next day it was discovered that<br />\n<br />\nHarriman could not make the panel on<br />\nWednesday but would be available for<br />\nalmost anytime on Thursday or Friday.<br />\nAt this point the panel was moved to Friday.<br />\nWednesday night, the students approached Pfeffer to participate on the<br />\npanel. He declined for various reasons<br />\nand suggested a number of people they<br />\ncould try. This led to Archibald and Rodriguez calling Chomsky at his home at<br />\nmidnight in order to invite him. Chomsky<br />\nstated that he would come if itwas physically possible for him to get to Baltimore<br />\nafter an afternoon speech at Cornell<br />\nUniversity. He agreed to call back at 11<br />\nthe next morning to confirm it.<br />\nThursday morning at 9:30 Archibald<br />\ninformed Gordon over the phone that<br />\nPfeffer would be unable to make it, but<br />\nthat the students had been able to secure<br />\nChom sky. Gordon,it is reported by Archibald, became \"quite disturbed,\" and<br />\ninsisted that Archibald call Chomsky off.<br />\n\"It's your mistake,\" Gordon is reported<br />\nto have said, \"You call him off.\" Archibald explained that he was not empowered<br />\nto do that on his own, and would have to<br />\nspeak to Rodriguez.<br />\nLater that morning, while awaiting<br />\n<br />\nChomsky's phone call, Rodriguez indicated to DeKuyper that if they could arrange a meeting with Gordon before<br />\nChomsky called back, the situation might<br />\nbe straightened out. DeKuyper stated that<br />\nGordon was in a very important committee meeting, and that the earliest time<br />\navailable would be 2 :15 in the afternoon,<br />\nwhich was after Chomsky's verification<br />\nwas expected. Chomsky was contacted<br />\nthat morning and verified by Rodriguez<br />\nand Archibald.<br />\nThe afternoon meeting was between<br />\nGordon, Archibald, and Rodriguez. Dr.<br />\nGordon has refused to discuss the content of this meeting, insisting that it was<br />\n\"a private discussion.\" The events of the<br />\nafternoon became a matter of public record in that Rodriguez and Archibald<br />\nwere required to report to the Student<br />\nAssociation Cabinet.<br />\nAccording to the two students at the<br />\nmeeting, Gordon charged that the students displayed a gross lack of courtesy,<br />\nto him, but more importantly, to Governor Harriman. He felt that the two had<br />\n\"violated the ground rules\", in that they<br />\nhad agreed to get Pfeffer, and didn't consult him on their change of plans.<br />\n(Continued on page 4)<br />\n<br />\nSymposium Panel on CBW Remains Unreconciled<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nA speech linking criticism of the military to an \"international Communist<br />\nconspiracy\"<br />\nhighlighted Wednesday's<br />\nMilton S.

Noting that the<br />\nDefense Department has allocated $400<br />\nto $600 million for CBW in 1970, he outlined some of the weapons now being<br />\nstockpiled, including the deadly VX nerve<br />\ngas, and infectious plague toxins. The<br />\nCongresman charged that biological weapons are \"unreliable, uncontrollable, and<br />\nunpredictable\" and could lead to a worldwide epidemic.<br />\nMcCarthy said that according to testirnony by a member of the Army's Chemical and Biological Research division,<br />\nthere were plans to develop a synthetic<br />\ndisease that would be able to resist all<br />\nantibiotics. Development of this biological weapon has not gone ahead, McCarthy<br />\nsaid, because funds were cut this year<br />\nfor chemical and biological weapons.<br />\nDefoliants and Protocol<br />\nAlthough he criticized the use of tear<br />\ngas as an adjunct to lethal weapons,<br />\nCongressman McCarthy said that we<br />\nShould maintain a deterrent capability<br />\nin deadly chemicals for a limited time.<br />\nHe said, however, that we should abandon<br />\nbiological weapons unilaterally. He also<br />\ncriticized the use of defoliants as harmful to ecology and human life. He pointed<br />\nto Cancer Socity research that showed<br />\nbaby rats were born deformed as a result of their mothers' contacts with the<br />\ndefoliant 245-L.<br />\nCongressman McCarthy observed that<br />\nthe United States and Japan are the only<br />\ntwo major countries that haven't signed<br />\nthe Geneva Protocol of 1925, which bans<br />\nthe use of chemical and biological weapons. He said we have not made it clear<br />\nWhether or not we Will use these weapons<br />\n<br />\noffensively, and thus, he charged,we are<br />\neroding the restraint of the 1925 pact.<br />\n\"The Geneva Protocol of 1925,\" he said,<br />\n\"is one of the few successful cases of<br />\nmankind getting together to limit weapons. We can build other arms-control<br />\nagreements on this one.\" He added,<br />\n\"The United States should ratify the<br />\nGeneva Protocol.\"<br />\nSeymour Hersh analyzed the history<br />\nand present set-up of the CBW program,<br />\ncharging that it was filled with \"doubletalk and double-think.\" He led off his<br />\ncomments with an anectode about a doctor working in CBW who introduced himself by saying, \"Hi! I'm in plague.\"<br />\nIn World War I, Hersh noted, 1.3<br />\nmillion people were killed by poison gas.<br />\nHe said that the use of this gas escalated during that war. In 1936 the Germans developed nerve gas, but it wasn't<br />\nuntil the 1950's, Hersh said, that the<br />\nU.S. started a full scale build-up of CBW<br />\nwith the help of German and Japanese<br />\nscientists. Extensive secrecy has always surrounded the development of<br />\nthese weapons, Hersh contended.<br />\n(Continued on page 7)<br />\n<br />\nRep. Richard McCarthy, Seymour Hersh, and Col.

Speaking at the conference were Dr.<br />\nLincoln Gordon, Dean Carl Swanson,who<br />\nis chairman of a Task-Force committee<br />\nappointed to study the problems involved<br />\nin implementing co-education, William<br />\nBrinkley, Director of Admissions, and<br />\nRoger Faxon, a junior who is onthe Task<br />\nForce.<br />\nGordon stated that admitting upperclass transfer students does not pose the<br />\nkinds of problems that opening admissions to women of the freshman level<br />\nwould entail, mainly that of housing. He<br />\nhas appointed the task force to examine<br />\nthe problems involved, and report back<br />\nby February 1, 1970. The school's twoyear residency requirement ruled out the<br />\npossibility of admitting senior transfers.<br />\nIt is generally expected that between<br />\n50 and 75 women will be admitted on this<br />\n<br />\ntransfer basis. Brinkly felt that\"50 could<br />\nbe counted on,\" but he wasn't sure about<br />\nmore than that. He had received two calls<br />\nthat morning from womenwho expressed<br />\ninterested in transferring. According to<br />\nBrinkly, most interest has been from<br />\ngirls interested in the sciences.<br />\n<br />\nLocal Girl::<br />\nSwanson denied that this set-up would<br />\nrule out the admission of women as freshman next year. He pointed out that even<br />\nwithout housing, local freshman girls<br />\ncould be admitted. All of these questions,<br />\naccording to Swanson, would be decided<br />\nby the Task Force, whichwould probably<br />\ngive two recommendations, one for next<br />\nfall and another long-range plan.<br />\nMr. Brinkley, while stating that the admissions office is ready to accept any<br />\ntransfer applications, pointed out that<br />\nit has no provision for taking women's applications for the freshman<br />\nclass. He did not feel that it would be a<br />\ngood idea to accept applications from<br />\ngirls who had been informed that they<br />\nmight not be able to come due to lack of<br />\nfacilities, but he did feel that if any decision to admit freshman women was<br />\nmade at a later date, the February 1<br />\ndeadline for receiving applications could<br />\n<br />\nbe waived.<br />\nAll present emphasized that the move<br />\nto co-education would not cut down on the<br />\nexchange programs with Goucher College. It was hoped that the program could<br />\nbe expanded and perhaps inaugurated with<br />\nother schools, such as the Maryland<br />\nInstitute of Art.<br />\n<br />\n\"Healthier Environment\"<br />\nSwanson, who commented that co-education would provide \"a healthier learning environment,\" pointed out that the<br />\nTask Force was not prepared to investigate the philosophy of undergraduate<br />\neducation. He stated that \"We are not a<br />\ntypical Liberal Arts college,\" due to<br />\nheavy emphasis on graduate work, with<br />\nmost undergraduates planning to go on<br />\nto graduate school of some kind. Hopkins, according to Swanson, provides \"an<br />\nenvironment of scholarship, and if you<br />\nprovide that and have limited resources,<br />\nyou cannot provide much else.\"<br />\nBesides Swanson and Faxon, the Task<br />\nForce committee consists of Dr. James<br />\nC. Walker of Physics, Ronald E. Sapp,<br />\ndirector of<br />\nadministrative systems,<br />\nMartin Vogel, a junior, and an undetermined member of the faculty.<br />\n<br />\n\fNov. 14, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nI Dr. Gordon Airs Views On Tonight's Panel I<br />\nNovember 14 with Governor Harriman<br />\naccordingly.<br />\nLater that morning I was informed that,<br />\n<br />\n(The following letter was delivered<br />\nto the News\u2014Letter office late Wednesday evening \u2014 Eds.)<br />\nTo The Editors:<br />\nI regret that reports of fragments of<br />\na private conversation in my office have<br />\nbeen taken out of context and circulated<br />\nin a way which has led to their publication in the News-Letter. The purpose<br />\nof this letter is to put those reports in<br />\nperspective.<br />\nAs you know, it occurred to me about<br />\ntwo weeks ago that in view of the great<br />\ninterest in the University community<br />\nconcerning the war in Vietnam, it might<br />\nbe useful to stimulate a serious discussion of the difficult and complex question<br />\nof how to extract ourselves from that<br />\nwar.<br />\nMy original notion was that this should<br />\nbe a panel discussion among qualified<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins faculty, including both SAIS and the Faculty of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. I wanted to assist in the<br />\narrangements only if there were substantial student interest in the idea, and<br />\ntalked with several students about it.<br />\nMessrs. Archibald and Rodriguez of the<br />\nStudent Association responded with enthusiasm. I asked Dr. Bevan to explore<br />\nwith SAIS and the Homewood Department<br />\nof Political Science whether faculty<br />\nmembers might be interested in participating in such a discussion.<br />\nOn November 4, Messrs. Archibald and<br />\nRodriguez met with Dr. Bevan and me to<br />\ntalk about the appropriate timing for the<br />\npanel and its composition. The student<br />\nspokesmen urged very strongly that an<br />\noutside figure of national prominence be<br />\nsecured in order to draw a large attendance. We discussed several possible<br />\nnames, and agreed that the best would be<br />\nGovernor Averell Harriman, whom I<br />\nthought I might persuade to come on the<br />\nbasis of our long-standing personal acquaintance. The other two panelists were<br />\nto be from SAIS and the Department of<br />\nPolit.Lcal Science, and I also agreed to<br />\njoin as a commentator on the other presentations.<br />\nOn November 5,1 ascertained that Governor Harriman could not come on<br />\nNovember 12; the date originally proposed, but could come either November<br />\n13 or 14.In a meeting with Messrs. Archibald and Goldberg that afternoon we<br />\nagreed that I should invite Harriman for<br />\nFriday, November 14. It was still understood, at least in my mind, that the other<br />\ntwo panelists would be Johns Hopkins<br />\nfaculty members. On Thursday morning,<br />\nNovember 6, I arranged the date of<br />\n<br />\nwithout any consultation with me, the<br />\nstudents had invited Dr. Noam Chomsky<br />\nof M.I.T. as a member of the panel.Since<br />\n<br />\nDr. Chomsky is a nationally known figure,<br />\nnot on the Johns Hopkins faculty, it<br />\nseemed to me that this was altering the<br />\ncharacter of the panel discussion and<br />\nchanging the basis onwhich I had secured<br />\nGovernor Harriman's acceptance. I felt<br />\nit discourteous to me not to have been<br />\nconsulted before inviting another outside<br />\nspeaker, and discourteous to Governor<br />\nHarriman to be changing the agreed arrangements without first consulting with<br />\nhim. My initial reaction was that,in these<br />\ncircumstances, Dr. Chomsky should be<br />\n\"disinvited.\"<br />\nThat afternoon, Messrs. Archibald and<br />\nRodriguez came back to explain to me at<br />\nlength why they felt Dr. Chomsky should<br />\nnot be \"disinvited.\" There followed a<br />\nrather heated conversation, the outcome<br />\nof which was an agreement on my part<br />\nto see whether Governor Harrimanwould<br />\naccept the revised panel composition. I<br />\nreached him that evening, and he graciously agreed to the new arrangements. I<br />\nam looking forward to what,I expect to be<br />\na highly enlightening and lively discussion.<br />\nIn the future, in order to avoid similar<br />\nmisunderstandings, I shall try to have the<br />\nbasis of respective action in cooperative<br />\nenterprises made even clearer than I<br />\nthought it was in this case. I shall also<br />\nseek a better understanding as to whether<br />\na private office conversation is intended<br />\nto be a subject for publication.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nLincoln Gordon, President<br />\n<br />\npic by hoffinatm<br />\n<br />\nGordon and Students \"Pleased\" But....<br />\n(Continued from page 3)<br />\nclarified his<br />\nlater<br />\nDr. Gordon<br />\n\"peanut\" statement by explaining that he<br />\nwas referring to Pfeffers' national stature. He also explained that he felt that<br />\nthe agreement was that the panel members would be faculty members, and<br />\nHarriman had been approached with this<br />\nunderstanding.<br />\nThe group finally worked out that they<br />\nwould explain the situation to Governor<br />\nHarriman, and if he would not sit on the<br />\npanel with Chomsky, Chomsky would be<br />\nasked to cancel.<br />\nRodriguez suggested that if that were<br />\nthe case, possibly the SA should not sponsor the event, and that it should be sponsored by the Administration.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Gordon felt that such action would<br />\ndestroy \"his hopes of ever working with<br />\nstudents on such a project again.\"<br />\nThat evening, Harriman agreed to sit<br />\non the panel with Chomsky, Dinnerstein,<br />\nand Gordon.<br />\nThe students pointed out the late hour<br />\nat which they had talked to Chomsky,and<br />\ntheir morning attempt to see Dr. Gordon.<br />\nRodriguez added that he had thought that<br />\nthe requirement was not so much to get<br />\nPfeffer as to obtain a speaker for the<br />\npoint of view which Pfeffer represented.<br />\nGordon reiterated that the agreement<br />\nwas that Harriman was to be the only<br />\ndrawing card, and that he was to face<br />\nPfeffer on the panel. Gordon condemned<br />\nthe students for their gross lack of cour-<br />\n<br />\ntesy, which he indicated was characteristic of their generation, and insisted that<br />\nthey call Chomsky and cancel his appear ance. He added that he felt the students<br />\nhad<br />\nproceeded in a \"bull-headed<br />\nfashion.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Gordon, Governor<br />\nHarriman had agreed under the impression that he was to be the only \"drawingcard\" and that he was going to sit on the<br />\npanel with a faculty member, inparticular Dr. Pfeffer.<br />\nGordon continued that he had high regard for Professor Chomsky, who he felt<br />\nwas on the very highest intellectual level,<br />\nbut that Pfeffer was a different case; he<br />\nwas an \"idiot and a peanut\" according to<br />\nGordon.<br />\n<br />\nFIND IT HARD<br />\nTO BELIEVE!<br />\n<br />\n3 <I,<br />\nmg<<br />\nONE PRICE POLICY<br />\nEVERY<br />\nSportcoat<br />\n<br />\nEVERY<br />\nSUIT<br />\n<br />\n24 I '39<br />\nValues to $50<br />\n<br />\nValues to $85<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nSAMPLE STORE<br />\n3031 Oreenmount Ave.<br />\nin Waverly<br />\nOPEN EVERY EVENING<br />\n<br />\n\u2022CHARG-IT \u2022NAC<br />\n<br />\n\u2022BANKAMERICAHD<br />\n<br />\nthere are easier ways to get your message across.<br />\n\u201e.><br />\n(O. \u2022f\u2022:. \u2022rve<br />\n<br />\nhM-IVITH CLAMITIa<br />\nTake advantage of our circulation at Homewood, Goucher, Notre Dame,<br />\nHampton House and the Med School.

Comments ranged from \"ridiculous!\" and \"It can't happen here\" to more mild explanations that graduate students are professionals being<br />\npaid for their work full time and will act accordingly. It<br />\nis known, however, that Dr. Robert Parr,chairman of the<br />\nChemistry Department, plans to cut the pay of any graduate<br />\nstudent who is not present during January by 50%. Dr.<br />\nParr also expressed the opinion that graduate study is a<br />\nfull time occupation, but he is the only professor who had<br />\ndecreed formal penalties for non-attendance.<br />\nMost of the work planned for the academic intersession is on a one to one \"independent study\" basis.

Lauren Walters, who had intended to<br />\naddress the General Assembly on the question of a University Senate, left the meeting \"wondering how we can have<br />\nany confidence in such a method of decision-making as<br />\nthis general assembly.\"<br />\nManuel Rodriguez, another student, wondered aloud<br />\nif \"we are going to have to wait'til next spring's Assembly meeting to determine if there is going to be a committee appointed to consider whether a committee ought<br />\nto be appointed to consider a University Senate.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Meeting<br />\nDr. Gordon directed the Assembly to a discussion of<br />\nthe Allied Health Sciences program. The proposal came<br />\nas a result of growing realization of the great shortage<br />\nof nurses and medical technicians at the Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nIt would be an attempt to train people for supervisory<br />\npositions, somewhat below the level of physicians but above<br />\nthe level of today's nurses and medical technicians.<br />\nThe program would involve admitting into Hopkins,<br />\nafter two years of college, students who wish to obtain<br />\nabove-average training for positions as nurses and medical technicians. Those admitted would get their bachelor's degree after two years, and many would hopefully<br />\ngo on for another one or two years to get their Masters'.<br />\nPeople for this program would be recruited from colleges<br />\nthroughout the country, rather than just from Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA major advantage of the training of such sub-professionals was that it would reduce the cost of medical care<br />\n(since these subprofessionals would not require as much<br />\ncostly training as doctors), and that it would produce a<br />\ngreater number of trained medical workers than are being<br />\nproduced by current educational methods.<br />\n<br />\nMany Girls<br />\nDr. Gordon mentioned another advantage of such a program: it would attract to Hopkins many girls who are no<br />\n<br />\nlonger satisfied to become only R.N.'s but also want<br />\nBachelor's degrees. Gordon said that the Hopkins nursing<br />\nschool is a dying institution, and that such a program<br />\nwould help to revive it.<br />\nThe issue, however, is very contrversial among the<br />\nHomewood faculty. Many question the desirability of the<br />\nprogram, maintaining that first priority should be given<br />\nto the great shortage of doctors by expanding the facilities of the medical school for that purpose.Others wonder<br />\nwhether it will really help to solve the shortage of nurses.<br />\nThe Academic Council recommended that Dean Kimball<br />\nappoint a committee of faculty members to study the relationship between this program and the faculty of the arts<br />\nand sciences. The committee, already appointed, consists<br />\nof Dr. Peter Achinstein of the Philosophy Department-(chairman), Dr. Stanely Corrsin of Mechanics, and Dr.<br />\nCharles Singleton of Humanities.<br />\n<br />\nAllow Them<br />\nIt has been proposed that these nurses and technicians<br />\nbe allowed to take regular courses at Homewood.Dr. Achinstein said that this, and other aspects of the proposed<br />\nprogram, would pose many questions. He said that he and<br />\nhis committee were investigating these questions, and<br />\nwould report their findings to the Academic Council.<br />\nAmong the problems cited by Achinstein was that of<br />\nexpanding the undergraduate body without lowering its<br />\noverall high quality. He said that there was a question of<br />\nwhether people comparable in ability to Hopkins students<br />\nwould be willing to enter such a program of study, or<br />\nwhether this program should take priority over the attempt<br />\nto admit a substantial number of undergraduate wornen<br />\ninto regular areas of study.<br />\nDr. Achinstein said that the issue was brought up at<br />\nthe General Assembly in order to let the faculty know that<br />\nthe committee was in operation, and that itwould welcome<br />\ntheir suggestions.<br />\n<br />\nAnd Finally<br />\nThe final issue discussed was the racial integration of<br />\nthe faculty. Individual efforts have been made by various<br />\ndepartments to secure black professors, but all efforts so<br />\nfar have failed. Many faculty members felt that it was time<br />\nto make the issue more public, to generalize it and involve<br />\n<br />\nLauren Walters has been wondering 1,3w the student<br />\nbody can \"have any confidence in such a method of<br />\ndecision-making\" as the Faculty General Assembly.<br />\nthe entire faculty. This feeling prompted those faculty<br />\nmembers present to pass a resolution, proposed by Dr.<br />\nJohn White, that both faculty and administration assign a<br />\nhigh priority to the integration of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nDr. Gordon said, \"I don't think that this is a financial<br />\nproblem...It's a matter of finding qualified people.\" He<br />\nstated that efforts to obtain black faculty members would<br />\nhave to be incorporated into the existing set of university<br />\npriorities, which include major space renovations, expanding of student recreational facilities, and maintaining<br />\nlevels of salaries and personnel benefits competitive with<br />\nthose of comparable universities.<br />\nDr. John Walton of the Education Department expressed<br />\nthe opinion that no such integration has ever succeeded<br />\nwithout a definite bias in favor of black candidates for<br />\nfaculty positions. He said, \"We should do whatever we<br />\ncan to attract qualified and needed black professors.\"<br />\nDr. White said, \"There is no real, visible sign that<br />\nthe attitude here (toward blacks) is right...When word<br />\ngets around that Hopkins is really trying,then people will<br />\nwant to come here.\"<br />\n<br />\n11112.;11112.<br />\n,<br />\n4116a711:1;411Xfictict:41ixotwagazaqv nt;ii bz<br />\nba;411bLt;111,Z.V*46;4.,..Wne,;41111V1111;t:11&;,,e;11$2.<br />\n,<br />\n.<br />\n,<br />\n. ailt.'111W sk.<br />\n:<br />\n;,..;20tcw 6;<br />\n.<br />\nt,4 oz;,/6qiip<br />\n'<br />\n. icezb;4111,1\u2022;111W16;2211/2011;t:11112;111W10;21;46W6;2\u201evo<br />\n...\u201e...,..,,,,,....z.;.w6;,,W11;1;,illift;d6W KW b2b;111Zililt;411W1 W nal<br />\n..,.....;:\u201e<br />\n.<br />\n47:4<br />\n.71 MAIM,MI4:7itr;:t Matr:71,7:4e7:1priN pri:tp^spriNMION C.71j<br />\n\"<br />\nI:;:i47i47.1 rr:74r^ir:<br />\n:1P574 Mi17471<br />\nr747.117<br />\n4<br />\nMt<br />\nP:47147:I44105:1Ms<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nMIMIMI<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n,:;:\u201e.:;:.z;7\u201e:;:\u201e:;:.,:;:.c,:i mii,.. ,<br />\n<br />\nMI<br />\n<br />\nMIMI<br />\n<br />\nMIMI<br />\n<br />\n.

Many of the people who<br />\ndid not attend classes yesterday, and who demonstrated, did not know<br />\ntheir own views concerning the war in Vietnam and on U.S. involvement<br />\nin the affairs of other nations.<br />\nThis ambiguity aids the Moratorium effort because it allows people<br />\nWith diverse points of view to participate together, and prevents the<br />\nfactionalism which has often hindered the \"peace wing\" in the past.<br />\nThere is no need for the Moratorium to espouse any one opinion on<br />\nU.S. involvement. Thus, you find some moratorium demonstrators calling<br />\nfor larger troop with/drawls and others for an end to U.S. imperialism.<br />\nHowever, for individuals, this ambiguity is counter-proudctive. The<br />\nPurpose of teach-ins and stopping \"business as usual\" is to give people<br />\nand the nation time to think about U.S. involvement in Vietnam so that<br />\nthey can formulate their own opinions. Use the time which you would<br />\nhave spent in class today for some serious thinking as well as demonstrating. Every person who participates in moratorium activities should<br />\nattempt to clarify and express his own position on the war. The<br />\nmoratorium asks America to stop and rethink its attitudes about foreign<br />\ninvolvement and national priorities. If those who participate do not<br />\nthink for themselves as well, the movement becomes dishonest.<br />\n<br />\nOnly Halfway Home<br />\nMany of the participants in the moratorium seem to be advocating<br />\nthat the troops be brought home--certainly nothing less, but nothing<br />\nmore either. It should be noted that bringing the American troops home<br />\nfrom Vietnam will not solve the problems inherent in the situation--for<br />\nAmerica or for the Vietnamese.<br />\nThe fact is that the U.S. is in Vietnam as a result of its desire to control<br />\n(politically and economically) the destiny of that country and of the<br />\nSouth East Asian people. Contrary to the ever-present rhetoric about<br />\nmaking the world safe for democracy and allowing the Vietnamese the<br />\nright of self-determination, American involvement represents an attempt<br />\nat control. In this case, fighting communism means retaining enough<br />\n<br />\nIF 4100 ARE- A<br />\n<br />\nAJV<br />\n<br />\ntOOT<br />\n<br />\nslow Htsickey_<br />\n<br />\nConnive for Complacency<br />\nThe recent actions of President Gordon bring to light his real intentions<br />\nin setting up today's debate. When Noam Chomsky was substituted for<br />\nRichard Pfeffer as a panel member, Dr. Gordon was obviously infuriated.<br />\nIt has become increasingly apparent that Dr. Pfeffer (referred to by Dr.<br />\nGordon as an \"idiot\" and 'pea nut\") was indeed to be used by Dr. Gordon<br />\nas a .foil for Averill Harriman. While this may have been a perfectly acceptable and normal maneuver when Dr. Gordon was at the State Department,<br />\nit is unbecoming in the behavior of a university president.<br />\nDr. Gordon worked with Manuel Rodriguez and Jim Archibald to set<br />\nup today's open forum, ostensibly in good faith and with the desire to<br />\npresent to the Hopkins community a meaningful debate on the moratorium and the war in Vietnam. The question to be answered is whether<br />\nor not Dr. Gordon wanted a debate where both sides would be fairly represented.<br />\nDid he in. fact want one that was weighted heavily toward<br />\nhis point of view? Dr. Gordon was afraid that the imbalance would be<br />\nupset by the presence of Dr. Chomsky, for whom he has the \"highest<br />\nregard\" intellectually.<br />\nThe other unfortunate result of Dr. Gordon's abortive ruse is that his<br />\npopularity and credibility with the faculty will sink even lower. Many<br />\nfaculty members have privately expressed dissatisfaction with the<br />\nPresident. When he makes slanderous i-emarks about a member of the<br />\nfaculty (after much talk about the Hopkins \"community\", it cannot<br />\nserve to aid his image. We hope that people will keep in mind Dr. Gordon's<br />\nactions of the past week and his attitude toward Hopkins professors and<br />\nstudents when he again tries to pass off notions of \"Academic Community\" and the respect due to faculty members.<br />\n<br />\n.1-e_OUR POLITICS G011,f, PRO-<br />\n<br />\nva\" CHAOS, AtJAPCHY<br />\nREMsstokl<br />\n<br />\nIF YOU Ak'5- A<br />\n<br />\nR11-(TICAt.

Forebodingwhat? We<br />\nshall know soon; the strings sing of fear. And indeed it is<br />\na fearful thing to think about tomorrow's March for Peace,<br />\nthe fear of bloodshed, of cracked heads and broken limbs<br />\n(our own), and tear-gassings and god knows what else.<br />\n(Would they dare fire shots into the crowd?)(How can you<br />\ncontain a half-million people in a peaceful posture?)There<br />\nwill be confrontation. It may be peaceful; it probably will<br />\nnot. The odds are not at all favorable: the unarmed army<br />\nis certain to be outgunned: symbols vs. weapons, spit vs.<br />\nmace, pot-smoke vs. tear gas. Yet the unarmed army has<br />\nno choice. It shall take casualties no matter what, and besides it must committed to peace.Peace means no violence<br />\n--for most of the army at any rate, although most is not<br />\nenough. There must be a total suicidal commitment<br />\nto having the shit kicked out of you while singing \"give<br />\npeace a chance.\" Tomorrow Washington must be visited by a half million saints.<br />\n<br />\nOnly A Fool<br />\nThat the Administration wants violence is clear enough,<br />\nfor only it can profit from violent confrontation. Washington wishes to discredit the peace movement by showing<br />\nthat it cannot remain true to its ideals. The burden of<br />\nproof rests upon those who are not in power. It is not an<br />\neasy task, but it would seem to be one worth trying at least<br />\none last time, just to see if massive peaceful demonstration of a moral position, of a statement of desired national behavior, has any effect whatsoever (in this democratic<br />\nsociety) upon both the people who rule it and the silent<br />\nmajority Sir Richard is always talking about. There can<br />\nbe no mistaking the extent of the peace movement if some<br />\nhalf million people are willing to travel however far to<br />\nparticipate in the demonstration. There is no silent majority, simply a figment of some President's imagination.<br />\nHere is an active vocal representation of areal presence<br />\nin this country that wants a return to peace and national<br />\nsanity. Only a fool could ignore such a demonstration.<br />\nIndeed.<br />\nA few weeks ago The New Republic voiced a tentative<br />\nhope that Mr. Nixon would continue to respect public opinion as he had in the past, yieldingto its whim for the sake<br />\nof a 'clear mandate.' Yet it seems clear that Nixon has<br />\nabandoned that passive role of reading public opinion for<br />\nthe more powerfully active one of making opinion. It was<br />\nreasonably astute of him or one of his advisors to realize<br />\nthat they could indeed reintroduce a kind of anti-propaganda into the President's speeches, whereby the public<br />\ncould be duped into believing that it had made up its own<br />\nmind while it yielded to the Administration's policies.<br />\nAmericans in general do not like the idea of being in the<br />\nminority, and, what with all of those nasty minorities getting everything for nothing, it was about time that majority rule be re-instituted. What they did not know, however, was how the majority of their fellow Americans<br />\nthought. Chances are that their fellow Americans did not<br />\nthink at all, but if they did it seemed to be apparent for a<br />\nwhile (check the Gallup polls of late summer, early fall)<br />\nthat the nation was tired of the war and wanted out. Not<br />\nso, says Mrs. Nixon.<br />\n<br />\nchannels they let good ol Dick now via good old Western<br />\nUnion.<br />\n\"I have on my desk a pile of telegrams which, when<br />\ncompressed in a vise, make a pile four inches high. I have<br />\nanother collection of telegrams here which,since we only<br />\nhad one vise in the Oval Room,make a loose pile some two<br />\nfeet high. This great disparity in pile heights is a clear<br />\nindication of the mood of the country or I don't know my<br />\npiles.\"<br />\nAnd so Richard Nixon yields to the majority which he<br />\ncreated and which he will let, now, create itself.<br />\n(But there was only a vague minority of cars on Veterans' Day driving duringthe daywith their lights on: is the<br />\nsilent majority also non-visual--or perhaps invisible?)<br />\nTomorrow five hundred thousand people will attempt to<br />\ndsicredit that silently approving majority by showing that<br />\nthe wishful thinking of the president cannot be corporealized--not even in America. Maybe Mr.Average American<br />\nwill decide to change his mind(again),since he has not let<br />\nanybody know how he thought before, and tell himself that<br />\npatriotism and peace can go together; that the flag is a<br />\nsymbol of the people, not the government; that maybe the<br />\nmarchers have a point--if only they'd cut their hair; and<br />\neven that to legitimize this grand movement and protect it<br />\nfrom the commiehippiefaggot elements, Mrs. Average<br />\nAmerica should take it over.<br />\nBut the dreams of the vocal idealist are not likely to be<br />\ncorporealized either -- even in America! Still, like the<br />\nPresident, we must try our best to getwhat we believe in<br />\n(tell me, please, that Nixon really does believe what he<br />\nsays--or even that he knows what he wants).<br />\n<br />\nBloody Spectres<br />\nYet, how long can we endure. If this demonstration is<br />\nreasonably peaceful, why should the next one be the same?<br />\nIf in March there is still another March on Washington (in<br />\ncommemoration of Norman Mailer), how can anyone<br />\nexpect it to be peaceful if nothing has changed? If this<br />\ncountry refuses to have a revolution of the mind and heart,<br />\nis it then willing to undergo one of the flesh with real bullets and real suffering and real massacres and real loss<br />\n<br />\nof face?<br />\nThe violins are growing more tortured,the drums deeper and louder. The fear is returning. The bloody spectre<br />\nof the Chicago debacle is resurrected. I do not like the<br />\npain, I do not like the gas,I do not like the mental anguish<br />\nof Chicago returning. We gather for the confrontation as<br />\nwe gather for peace--we are not given an alternative. The<br />\nguns are there and the clubs and the ....<br />\nWe step to the center of the arena and listening to the<br />\nsilence of the crowd, silent in approval, we take a deep<br />\nbreath and smile and mouth the word.<br />\nAnd when it has been consummatedwhatwill it have accomplished? Will it reveal the brutality of the system of<br />\n\"law and order\" for the status quo? Chicago did that: no<br />\none has forgotten. More sufferingwill reveal little that is<br />\nnew. Will it bring sympathy for the peace marcher? Some,<br />\nperhaps, but the silent majority will remain silent regardless of how they feel and will be led (unintimidated, so they<br />\nwill believe) bytheir President. Will it change Nixon's<br />\nmind? A contradiction interms. Hewill read about it in<br />\nthe newspapers (spaced amid the news of the astronauts),<br />\nhear it second hand from his advisors, watch it edited on<br />\ntelevision, and go for a swim. Will it bring peace? No,<br />\nbecause 'the national shall not be shamed into defeat by<br />\nthe North Vietnamese or their American counterparts.'<br />\nThen why go at all, why risk the beatings and the mace<br />\nand the tear gas?<br />\nWe shall go because we have beentaught that silence is<br />\ndamning: the silent majority of Nixon's dream world is the<br />\nsame silent majority we have condemned elsewhere in another country during another war for permitting the continuation of a moral outrage. We are trying to bring peace<br />\nand life into the world, into the minds of our countrymen.<br />\nNothing more. Time will judge us, but at least our children (should they live that long) will know where we stood<br />\nand why.<br />\nWe must go to Washington in peace and do our damndest<br />\nto retain that peace.<br />\nThere can be no neutrality: silence assents to the continuation of the killing in the President's quaint, peaceful,<br />\napproved way.

If Bryan were to be<br />\na viable candidate in the future, he would<br />\nhave to demonstrate his party loyalty by<br />\neffusions of support for Justice Parker.<br />\nAlthough Bryan had not considered this<br />\nthe most opportune time to pursue his<br />\nthird nomination,it was generally believed that he had not abandoned his ambitions. During certain speeches, he was<br />\nintroduced as a \"future President of the<br />\nUnited States.\"<br />\nBryan's party loyalty was espcially<br />\nsuspect because of an incident of 1893.At<br />\nthat time President Cleveland, a Democrat decided to respond to the current<br />\nPanic by checking inflation; his method of<br />\nattack was to recommend to a Democratic Congress the repeal of the Sherman<br />\nSilver Purchase Act. The Sherman Act<br />\nbore the name of a great Republican, and<br />\nhad been passed with the help of certain<br />\nProminent Republicans in Congress, among them William McKinley. (This is<br />\nnot to say there was a solid Republican<br />\nfront for the Sherman bill; House deaker<br />\nThomas B. Reed was a prominent dissenter)<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\ni an Democracy. (When he finally became<br />\nSecretary of State, Bryan was not notably<br />\nsuccessful in establishing a Christian<br />\nforeign policy-but that is another story).<br />\n<br />\nTeddy Even Worse<br />\nThese facets of Bryan's attitude may<br />\nbe seen in his Missouri campaign swing<br />\nof early October. He announced that foreign policy was the greatest issue of the<br />\ncampaign, and that in this issue Justice<br />\nParker was demonstrably superior to<br />\nPresident Roosevelt. Since Bryan was<br />\nnot given to dissembling, he failed to display flaming enthusiasm for Justic Parker. He did remark that, in those areas<br />\nwhere Parker was wanting, Roosevelt<br />\n<br />\nwas even worse. With slightly more effort, Bryan might have been as deep a<br />\nparty loyalist as Senator Hill.<br />\nBryan's 1904 speeches really show no<br />\ngreat aptitude for discussion of Justice<br />\nParker. However, Bryan did retain the<br />\ngreat talent of his earlier years,the ability to discuss himself. Once he was introduced as the Moses of the Democratic<br />\nparty, and modestly said that Moses had<br />\nbeen a poor speaker and God had assigned Aaron to speak for Moses, so Bryan<br />\nwould have to describe himself as the Aaron of the party. Here Bryan was calling<br />\nattention to the fact that Parker was not<br />\nspeaking for himself and Bryan as a party<br />\nloyalist had shouldered the burdent of<br />\n<br />\nspeaking for him. The implied comparison of Justice Parker with Moses is interesting, but analysis must be left to<br />\nthose more profound than myself.<br />\nBryan's grudging support of Parker<br />\nwas manifested in several speeches, in<br />\nwhich the Boy Orator advertised himself<br />\nrather than his party's candidate. It is<br />\nreasonably clear that Bryan had an interest in seeing Justice Parker decimated,<br />\nsince he would then be in position to regroup his own forces for 1908. Throughout 1904, both advocates and opponents of<br />\nBryan could easilty perceive the reality<br />\nbehind the gessamer facade of Democratic unity.<br />\n<br />\nEd Mendelsohn<br />\n<br />\nBLACK POWER<br />\n<br />\nBryan was a second-term pre-silver<br />\nRepresentative from Nebraska, and he<br />\na nnounced that due to Cleveland's policy<br />\nhe might\"serve my country and my God\"<br />\nelsewhere than in the Democratic party.<br />\nPresumably he was thinking of the Popwhose support he sought a year<br />\nlater, when he opened an ill-fated camPaign for the U.S. Senate. At the time he<br />\nth reatened apostacy, Bryan was far from<br />\na household word. The incident became<br />\nPublicized just as Bryan was organizing<br />\nhis 1896 campaign, Senator David B.Hill<br />\nW as murmuring that \"I am a Democrat<br />\nstill-very still,\" and Bryan was piously<br />\ndeprecating such callous lack of party<br />\nloyalty. It also developed that in one election, when the Democratic candidate was<br />\nbat to his liking, Bryan has simply<br />\n'scratched\" the ticket.<br />\nContrived Support<br />\nIt is evident that, unless Bryan could<br />\ncontrive a semblance of enthusiasm for<br />\nJ ustice Parker, the depth of his party loYaltY would be exposed; that is, he would<br />\nbe seen to favor unity among Democrats<br />\nso long as the Presidential candidate was<br />\nrYan. Bryan's difficulty was that his enthusiasm for Justice Parker was<br />\nParable to the feelings felt by a worm on<br />\nthe approach of an early bird. This was no<br />\nsecret in 1904, and was indeed strongly<br />\nindicated by Bryan's myriad remarks at<br />\nthe National Convention which have already been adequately discussed. In<br />\n191-2, when he was entirely free of the<br />\nniceties and restraints imposed by the<br />\ncontest of 1904, Bryan remarked that the<br />\nforces which prevailed at the 1904 Convention were \"reactionary.\"<br />\nHowever, it should not be thought that<br />\nBryan convertly desired the success of<br />\nPresident Roosevelt. It is true that in<br />\n1908 Bryan, aware of the tremendous<br />\nPoPularity of the outgoing President, attempted to style himself as the progenitor of the Roosevelt policies. One reMarkable feature of Bryan's 1908 camPalgn was that the issue offoreign policy<br />\nWhich bulked so large in his effort of 1900,<br />\ncommanded little of his attention. (Twill<br />\nProbably explain this, eventually). In<br />\n1904, Bryan's statements still indicated a<br />\ndeep concern with foreign policy, and<br />\nhere he considered himself irreconcilably at odds with Roosevelt. In Bryan's<br />\neyes, Roosevelt was an imperialist,while<br />\nthe Nebraskan's foreign policy was based<br />\non goodwill and other Christian precepts,<br />\nPlus the general tolerance to other<br />\nPeople which Bryan read into Jefferson-<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nThe Pioneer SX 440, striking in black,<br />\ncan give you all the power you could<br />\n<br />\never ask for<br />\n<br />\nat black market prices.<br />\n<br />\nAfter All, Black IS Beautiful<br />\nSTORE HOURS<br />\n<br />\nCUSTOM MUSIC .SYSTEMS<br />\n<br />\nSTEREO<br />\n<br />\nSTERN<br />\n<br />\nMON. 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\nHI<br />\nFIDELITY<br />\n106 W.

In<br />\nbehalf of Bufonidae, the Hyladae<br />\nand the Renadae, to mention only<br />\nthe most numerous groups, I demand an apology for this undeserved slur. I catagorically deny that<br />\nany frog, or toad for that matter,<br />\ncould possibly turn into Richard<br />\nNixon under any circumstances<br />\nWhatsoever.

Its purpose is to provide a better screening process<br />\nfor those undergraduate candidates who wish to participate in<br />\nthe committees.<br />\nThe only changes the amendment makes are in the selection<br />\ntime of the interviewing committee (moving it from the autumn to<br />\nthe preceding spring) and in the<br />\nnumber of candidates recommended by the screening committee to the Student Council.<br />\nThe committee is eminently more<br />\nqualified to adjudge the better<br />\ncandidates since it has been able<br />\nto thoughtfully consider each applicant.<br />\nI would therefore like to correct an erroneous statement that<br />\noccurred in the November 7<br />\n<br />\nBill Canis '72<br />\n<br />\nMORATORIUM NO. 1<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe October 15th Moratorium<br />\nwas indeed a success. It attracted the support and backing of a<br />\nspectrum of American<br />\nwide<br />\nI society. It was spearheaded by<br />\nthe students and youngpeople who<br />\n\u2022 have been in the forefront of the<br />\npeace movement for years.It was<br />\n\u2022 particularly heartening to see that<br />\nthousands of housewives, businessmen, and a large segment<br />\nof a previously 'silent minority'<br />\nwere taking a stand on the issue.<br />\nHopefully, the November anti-war<br />\n<br />\nactivities will demonstrate even<br />\nstronger opposition to our government's policies. However,it<br />\nis imperative that the issue of the<br />\nwar in Vietnam be viewed within<br />\nthe greater context in which it<br />\noccurs.<br />\nFor our tragic war policy is<br />\nmerely a symptom of a far greater sickness permeating many<br />\naspects of American life. Perhaps this sickness is best manifested in the uresponsiveness of<br />\nour governmental institutions today to basic human needs and<br />\nrights. Inequities, injustices,<br />\npoverty, brutality, destruction,<br />\nand racism.These words can only<br />\ninadequately describe the conditions and situations to which all<br />\nAmericans should address themselves.<br />\nThere is a vital linkage, then,<br />\nbetween the Vietnam War and<br />\nother deep social problems. If<br />\nthe issue of the war is divorced<br />\nfrom the larger context in which<br />\nit should be viewed, as unfortunately many anti-war demon-<br />\n<br />\nPHALLIC<br />\n<br />\nstrators would have it, then indeed a naive and simplistic outlook has been adopted. One need<br />\nonly look at the hesitancy of the<br />\nleaders of the black community<br />\nin Baltimore to throw their full<br />\nenergies in support of the Moratorium. For they may legitimately claim that many of the<br />\nanti-war protestors, once the war<br />\nhas finally ended (or after the<br />\nissue has died), will triumphantly state \"we won,\" as if the major<br />\nsocietal ill had finally been cured. The ending of the war in Vietnam should only signal the initiation of a far greater commitment<br />\nby all concerned Americans to<br />\nthe great struggle that lies ahead<br />\nat home. We hope that those<br />\nAmericans sincerely concerned<br />\nwith this tragic war will realize<br />\ntheir commitment and obligation<br />\nto become involved in the elimination of all the pressing problems facing this nation now and<br />\nin the future.

HOELSCHER<br />\nAfter 44 years of government vacilation, the Hopkins Medical School has<br />\ntaken steps to force ratification of the<br />\n1925 Geneva Protocol.<br />\nFrederick Henderson, a medical student and Chairman of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Institutions Students for Peace,<br />\nhas sent personal letters to over 150<br />\nmedical schools in the United States,<br />\n\"urgently\" requesting that letters be<br />\nsent to every Senator and calling for<br />\npassage of the Protocol in the Senate.<br />\nThe Geneva Protocol calls for all signatories to aid in preventing the use of<br />\npoisonous or bacteriological agents in<br />\ntime of military action. Although most of<br />\nthe nations of the world signed the post\u2014<br />\nWorld War I accord,the Protocol has<br />\nbeen pending in the United States Senate<br />\nfor many years.<br />\n<br />\nDeeply Troubled<br />\nHenderson stated that he was \"deeply<br />\ntroubled by the priorities of a government<br />\nwhich slashes funds for legitimate medical research while continuing to support<br />\n<br />\nthe research and development of CBW agents.\" He indicated the need for institutions of medical education to put themselves on record as firmly opposed to CBW.<br />\nActivity at the Hospital was mirrored<br />\nin Washington. Shocked by recent publicity on the storage and testing of CBW<br />\nagents, 98 Congressmen and 20 Senators<br />\nhave sponsored resolutions urging President Nixon to push the ratification of the<br />\nProtocol.<br />\nIn addition to the Students of Peace,<br />\nHenderson is involved with the Medical<br />\nCommittee for Human Rights.. The Committee was formed by students concerned<br />\nover the possibility of violence in Washington during the Moratorium.The Committee Will provide a \"neutral medical<br />\npresence\" tomorrow.<br />\nDaryl Matthews, recruiter and coordinator for the Hopkins contingent, described the purposes of the Medical Committee for Human Rights(MCHR)effort<br />\nas \"care for anyone in need.\" Some 20 to<br />\n40 medical and nursing students prepared<br />\nfor the demonstrations Wednesday night<br />\nin a crash course of first aid. The course<br />\nis being given by Dr. Norman Hollingsworth, Associate Professor of Anaesthe-<br />\n<br />\nq9 A BALLANTINE THREE RING THING 99<br />\n<br />\nsiology at the Medical School.<br />\nIn addition to providing _care to the<br />\ninjured, medical students will pass out<br />\nblack armbands to those students marching in Washington. There is a similar attempt to collect sufficient funds to place<br />\nan add in the Sunpapers called both for support of the Moratorium and an end to biological research and development.<br />\nOrganizers of the Committee expressed surprise at the lack of support for the<br />\nMoratorium shown by medical students at<br />\nHopkins. Henderson noted that initial estimates of student support showed that<br />\nover 200 students planned to march in<br />\nWashington. By yesterday, however,the<br />\nnumber had dwindled to less than 50.<br />\nHenderson stated that the fear of violence probably scared many of the students.<br />\nMedical Aid<br />\nThe students and professionals still<br />\nplanning to participate in the Washington<br />\nmarch will be joined by similar groups<br />\nfrom other medical schools across the<br />\ncountry. Medical aid is being rendered<br />\nat three satellite stations throughout<br />\nWashington on Friday and at eight stations on Saturday. These satellite facilities, which will be set up in local church-<br />\n<br />\nes, are complemented by a pool of cars,<br />\nrigged as mobile first aid vehicles to answer special calls for aid. These vehicles<br />\nare to be controlled by a central unit.<br />\nSuch comp19:: arrangements have not<br />\nyet been tried by the medical school. Last<br />\nOctober, the Medical Students for Peace<br />\nmarched from the Hopkins Plaza, downtown to City Hall. There,they assembled<br />\nfor an afternoon of speeches by such nat\u2014<br />\nional figures as former Alaskan Senator<br />\nErnest Gruening and Mrs. Martin Luther<br />\nKing.<br />\nGruening and former Senator Wayne<br />\nMorse of Oregon were the only opponents<br />\nof the 1965 Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The<br />\nformer Alaskan senator was one of the<br />\nmost adamant early spokesmen against<br />\nthe Vietnam War.<br />\nIn an interview, Matthews, a third year<br />\nmedical student, pointed out that the style<br />\nof medical care delivery will differ drastically from previous violent demonstrations. Previously, medical personnel,<br />\nweighted down by equipment and supplies,.<br />\nwere among the least mobile persons in<br />\nthe crowds.

We believe that<br />\nthe students at this university and<br />\nany other university have the<br />\nmoral and constitutional right to<br />\nactively demonstrate their concerns in a peaceful manner, to<br />\npetition grievances to the government of the United States, and to<br />\norganize as a leading stimulus for<br />\npeace.<br />\nWithin the framework of free<br />\nspeech<br />\nand assemblage, we<br />\nwholeheartedly agree that this<br />\nuniversity's administration has<br />\nthe duty to recognize and respect<br />\nthe student assemblage that will<br />\noccur on November 13,14 and 15.<br />\n<br />\nThe Jewish Students'Association<br />\n<br />\nROTC REVIVAL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn my letter of last week on<br />\nROTC, a phrase omitted in publication changed the sense of the<br />\nfollowing statement that should<br />\nread: \"The data shows that student participation in ROTC in the<br />\n\u2022 1930's and again in the 1950's<br />\nranged from 260-435 per year,<br />\nand the number of officers commissioned from the program<br />\nranged from 28-52 per year.\"<br />\nRecall that in the 1930's, the total<br />\nundergraduate<br />\npopulation ran<br />\n<br />\nabout 800-900 and in the early<br />\n1950's about 1300-1400.

I personally participated in a long<br />\nmeeting in which the chapter<br />\nagreed not to lead any general<br />\nheckling of the Senator. Most of<br />\nus felt that our point would be better made by asking questions<br />\nabout his work in the Senate that<br />\nwould cut through his polite<br />\nfacade and expose him as the<br />\ncriminal that he is. We agreed<br />\nalso, to a silent comment on the<br />\nSenator's racist role in Congress<br />\nin the form of two figures dressed<br />\nas Ku Klux Klansmen on either<br />\nside of the stage. We were informed the morning before the speech<br />\nthat the Motherfuckers planned to<br />\nattend and heckle. We voted, as I<br />\nsaid above, not to lead heckling<br />\nwith them. Let it be clear to you<br />\nthat SDS has no control over any<br />\nother group on or off campus, nor<br />\nde we feel we should try to exert<br />\nsuch control.<br />\n2) My second point is directed<br />\nat those people at Hopkins and<br />\nelsewhere who saw fit to expend<br />\namazing amounts of energy taking votes, writing letters and<br />\nbustling about in general in order<br />\nto condemn the \"rudeness\" of the<br />\n\"hecklers.\" If this is the best<br />\n<br />\nBARTHELME DEFENDED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIf you are to have someone<br />\nreview a book as important as<br />\nDonald Barthelme's Unspeak-<br />\n<br />\nable Practices, Unnatural Acts,<br />\nyou might be sure that he is aware<br />\nthat UPUA was Barthelme's third,<br />\nnot second book. The first, Come<br />\nRack, Dr. Caligari, is published<br />\nin paperback by Anchor. Also,<br />\nhe might have read beyond the<br />\ncover pages of Snow White.<br />\nThe cover was a typical Bantam<br />\nsexploitation of a strictly nonporno experimental novel. Anyway, I can understand not liking<br />\nUPUA; it's a very strange book.<br />\nSo strange in fact that value<br />\njudgement is perforce arbitrary<br />\nand premature. It's like nothing<br />\never written before, and anyone<br />\nseriously interested in the contemporary short story should<br />\nread Barthelme without delay.<br />\n<br />\nElliot Krieger '70<br />\n<br />\nGRAD PRIORITY!<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn enthusiastic agreement with<br />\nB.L.'s letter opposing coeducation at Hopkins, I would like to<br />\naddress a few thoughts to this<br />\nso-called \"liberal community of<br />\n<br />\nscholars.\" First: Bringing women to Hopkins while it remains<br />\nessentially a training ground for<br />\nfactory--robot chem-throats is<br />\nabsurd. Symptomatic of these<br />\nconditions is the case of Dr. William H. McClain. When he came<br />\nto this quasi-RAND-like processing think-tank, Dr. McClain was<br />\nthe entire Department of Hummanities. There are still no departments of music or fine arts.<br />\nThe History Department only recognizes America. The English<br />\nDepartment services for undergraduatps are symbolized in the<br />\npopular renaming of its prized<br />\nseminal book, J. Hillis God, The<br />\nDisappearance of ,ililler. The<br />\nlanguage departments possess<br />\nthe comprehensiveness of a good<br />\nhigh school. It is a clinched truth<br />\nthat the humanities at Hopkins<br />\nare simply there for show. As<br />\nsuch, the aura of ravishing fair<br />\nyoung maidens billowing down<br />\nthe valleys of the quads is a myth.<br />\nThe real nightmare must be faced. The Women brought to Hopkins<br />\nwould only be more of the same-torturous eyesore\u2014i.e. a<br />\na<br />\nfemale version of the C Level<br />\ntechnocrat grinding away...0h<br />\nwere are the beautiful souls?<br />\nSecond: A sociological dimension. The present sexual deprivation of J.H.U. serves a \"subversive\" interest. The Defense Department and technological corporations need a \"managerial<br />\nelite\" that is composed of calm,<br />\ncool, cold \"clean machines.\"<br />\nBut the social mood that infects<br />\na large part of Hopkins does not<br />\nbreed \"normal\" controlled people. To be sexually denied now<br />\nwill lead to resentment, rebellion and aggressive behavior<br />\nlater. This psychological situation may produce General Curtis<br />\nLeMay's but can only embarrass<br />\nthose sophisticated merchants of<br />\nsystems analysis who speak<br />\ncalmly of megadeaths in a nuclear<br />\n<br />\nwar. Of course, paradoxically,<br />\nthis deprivation does aid the machine interests by fostering\"I-it\"<br />\nrelationships. It leads to a feeling<br />\nof naturalness in being fake, a belief that people are objects. This<br />\nWeltanschauung is a prerequisite<br />\nto being a corporate manager. All<br />\nthe while, these people will piously proclaim the beauty of art, supporting it as a \"cultural accountrement\" to a \"civilized<br />\nsociety.\" To conneect the weaving flows: The lack of coeducation at Hopkins hurts its ability<br />\nto function as a high quality technicist institute. Thus,the absence<br />\nof women will help put a wrench<br />\ninto the conveyor belt.<br />\nThird; A rather pessimistic<br />\ntangent, I guess; an attempt to<br />\nburst the endless layers of gauze<br />\nthat substitute a pseudo -reality<br />\nfor life. Soon, The Little Prince<br />\nwill be a big commercial movie.<br />\nAll is absorbed by the vacuum<br />\ncleaner; the centrifuge is constantly at work, discarding the<br />\ndredge of culture. As I walk down<br />\nthe tree lined routes, I feel<br />\nstrangely unreal and detached-so estranged. I seem to just float<br />\nabove the quad and laugh ever so<br />\nsadly as I watch the patterns of the<br />\nsmall groups interacting, skilled<br />\nin the frauds of social grace. In<br />\nfascination, I walk and dream and<br />\nobserve the game players.Sornehow the word \"romantic\" and the<br />\nenvironment \"Hopkins\" will always seem mutually exclusive.<br />\nBut, alas, we must stop the conceit. The humanities student, that<br />\npresentable piece of fluff, is unfair to the technicist men and<br />\ngirls.<br />\ncomputer-programmed<br />\nHe affects a studied superiority<br />\ncomplex because he usually succumbs to feeling uptight. He<br />\npreaches the romantic way and<br />\nreads Keats and studies Picasso<br />\nbut laughs (else he would cry)<br />\nwhen he sees the reality of Baltimud that lies beyond the Georgian<br />\n.(Continued on page 17)<br />\n<br />\nThe only book of its kind!<br />\n<br />\nThe New Guide<br />\nto Study Abroad<br />\nby JOHN A.

If the<br />\nadministration does not feel that<br />\nthe complainant has been wronged--and only students can be<br />\ncharged with wrongdoing--there<br />\ncan be no action taken against<br />\nthe student. If, on the other hand,<br />\nthe administration agrees that the<br />\nstudent has erred, it may sanction him. The student may then<br />\nappeal any sanction to an appeals<br />\nboard; an appeal is automatic for<br />\nthe sanction of suspension.<br />\nThus the appeals board will<br />\nbe charged, whenever it meets,<br />\nwith upholding or overturningthe<br />\nverdict of the administration. An<br />\nadministrator sits as a voting<br />\nmember, along with three-Stu-<br />\n<br />\nBest Folk Music in<br />\nBaltimore<br />\n<br />\ndents and three faculty members,<br />\non the appeals board. But the<br />\nadministration wishes to reserve<br />\nthe right to overturn any decision of the appeals board. Thus,<br />\nthe administration is involved in<br />\nall stages of the judicial process.<br />\nIt seems to me that there are<br />\nglaring sources of bias in this<br />\nprocedure. It does not alter the<br />\npresent absence of methods for<br />\ndealing with faculty and administration harassment of students,<br />\nas occurred with respect to the<br />\nOctober 15th teach-in. It does not<br />\npermit a student with a complaint<br />\nto do anything about the complaint<br />\nwihtout his enlisting the administration's agreement. It does<br />\nnot allow a student to be judged<br />\nby his peers without his first<br />\nbeing declared guilty by the administration. By giving the administration a veto over the appeals board's recommendations,<br />\nit<br />\ngreatly limits the board's<br />\npower.<br />\nThis new conduct policy has<br />\nbeen hailed as a vast improvement over Hopkins' present judicial system which contains no<br />\nappeals procedure. But the ability<br />\nof the administration, in the new<br />\ndocument, to prejudice a case<br />\n<br />\nagainst a student, in the new<br />\nagainst a student, to participate<br />\non the appeals board, and to<br />\noverturn any decision by that<br />\nboard, leads me to believe that<br />\nthe new document gives us nothing more than the appearance of<br />\nchange.<br />\n<br />\nbut undermines any sense of community by calling for justice to<br />\nbe administered from above, and<br />\nnot by one's peers.

In previous weeks,the most unanswerable question was? \"What<br />\nwent wrong?\" Yet last Saturday's second half performance pushed<br />\nsuch questions into the background.<br />\n<br />\nFans Brave Weather<br />\nAnyone of the few diehard Hopkins fanswho braved the weather and<br />\ncould afford the university's unrealistic admissions charge could see<br />\nthat Sotir's suspicions had been put aside when linebacker Paul Weiss<br />\nsnagged an errant Mike O'Neal pass and ran it back 40 yards from<br />\nHopkins' third touchdown of the afternoon.<br />\nUnlike Lloyd Eaton of Wyoming and John Pont of Indiana who have<br />\nhad their conference and bowl bids upset by racial and disciplinary<br />\nstrife, Alex Sotir is riding high.<br />\nJust as Red Auerbach used to light up his victory cigar.

To answer this question<br />\none must turn the clock back to the Jays' first loss of the season against Ursinus. After this 19-14 setback, the format of practice was<br />\nchanged.<br />\nThe result was that the young team as a whole was more tense and<br />\nfelt compelled to win or else be punished in the following week's practice. Back-to-back losses to Hampden-Sydney and Carnegie-Mellon proved that more hittingwasn't the answer. Of course it is doubtful as to whether or not the team would have won these ball games if<br />\nthe format had not been changed.<br />\nNevertheless, Coach Sotir showed the flexibility that has endeared<br />\nhim to his players when the team returned to its former format a week<br />\nago last Tuesday. This move restored much of the team's confidence,<br />\nand at the end of the week Sotir felt the club \"had turned the corner.\"<br />\n<br />\nMomentum With Jays<br />\nIn tomorrow's contest at Dickinson, one has to give the momentum<br />\nto the Jays. Dickinson,whose defense had been nationally ranked, suffered a humiliating 49-0 loss to Wilkes College followed by a slim 2120 Homecoming loss to Ursinus last Saturday. Dickinson thereby<br />\ndropped out of contention for the coveted MAC crown.<br />\nAfter one of Sotir's spirited pep talks last week, one player mused:<br />\n\"I wonder if he stays up all night figuring out what he's going to say to<br />\nthe team or whether the talks are just off the cuff?\"<br />\nIt doesn't matter that Hopkins probably won't get a chance to play<br />\nin the first Knute Rockne Bowl. For when the team leaves the locker<br />\nroom at Carlisle tomorrow afternoon, one thought will be dominant.<br />\n\"LET'S WIN THIS ONE FOR LEX!\" In an era, when there seems to<br />\nbe an equal amount of victimization of coaches by players as players<br />\nby coaches (an era, which the Varsity footballteam has luckily escaped) could Charley Eckman or Vince Bagli have put it any better?<br />\n<br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\nJennings House, behind the running of John Karos and brilliant lineplay of Dave Williams,stunned Clark 21-7 for the Freshman Dormitory Championship last week on Levering Field.

All the Blue Jay<br />\nscoring took place in the second half, leading to<br />\na rout of the weak, but battling Swarthmore club.<br />\nThe first half of the contest was dull, neither<br />\nteam sustaining an offensive drive. The half<br />\namounted to an exchange of punts between the two<br />\nteams. Hopkins did come as close as the Swarthmore 14 yard line, where however, the drive was<br />\nhalted as a fourth down pass from quarterback<br />\nBob Pfeffer fell incomplete.<br />\nSwarthmore, a team which had won only one<br />\ngame, succumbed to the stronger Blue Jays, in<br />\nthe second half. Swarthmore had little depth and<br />\nbench strength, many of its squad playing both<br />\n( Hopkins scored the first time it had the ball<br />\nfollowing a Swarthmore punt, after Swarthmore<br />\nreceived the second half kickoff.<br />\nDan Augustine, who was named by Coach Alex<br />\nSotir as the Blue Jays most valuable offensive<br />\nplayer of the game, hauled in a pass from Bob<br />\nPfeiffer and carried the ball to the Swarthmore<br />\n32 yard line. After a run to the 18 yard line which<br />\ngave Hopkins another first down, Augustine was<br />\nhanded the ball on an option play, and threw to end<br />\nBill Donovan to the three yard line.<br />\nA motion penalty brought the ball back to the<br />\nSwarthmore 8, where on three downs Hopkins was<br />\nunable to move the ball. On fourth down, the Blue<br />\nJays lined up to kick a field goal. Bob Pfeiffer,<br />\nholding on the play, took the snapfrom center and<br />\nfired a pass to Bill Utz for the touchdown.<br />\n<br />\nTry Fake Field Goal<br />\nThe fake field goal had caught Swarthmore off<br />\n<br />\nguard. This play,the first Hopkins' score in eleven<br />\nquarters, provided the incentive for the Blue Jays,<br />\nas they began to play a more potent brand of football.<br />\nThe key play of the game for the Blue Jays may<br />\nhave been the 40 yard interception and runback<br />\nof a Swarthmore pass by linebacker Paul Weiss.<br />\nWeiss is the leading groundgainer of the team this<br />\nyear. Weiss who had ankle problems, was not<br />\nactually up to par physically to play fullback.<br />\nThis fine defensive play may then have re -instilled a new spirit in the club which is essential to the Hopkins club winning the conference<br />\ntitle.<br />\n<br />\nCieslowski Races 63 Yds<br />\nHopkins final score came on a 63 yard run by<br />\nJoe Cieslowski late in the fourth quarter. Cieslowski ran off tackle, made a beautiful cut to<br />\nthe outside, and outraced the Swarthmore defensive backs for the score. Here for the first time<br />\nin three weeks, a smile came to the lips of Coach<br />\nSotir.<br />\nBob Pfeiffer ran the option play for 53 yards in<br />\nthe 3rd quarter to account for the 2nd Hopkins<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nThe execution of the offensive unit was much<br />\nsharper in the second half and the defense played strongly throughout the contest.<br />\nThe game next week against Dickinson is most<br />\ncrucial to the Blue Jays if their hope for a third<br />\nConference title is to be realized. The ability of<br />\nthe offense and defense to make the big play, as<br />\nevidenced in the Swarthmore game, must be repeated in the Dickinson contest. However, the<br />\nspirit and pride of the team has been renewed,<br />\nand this will be a definite factor in Hopkins favor.<br />\n<br />\nWashington Stifles Hopkins Rooters<br />\nJohns Hopkins varsity soccer team had their<br />\nhopes for a league title ended as the Jays were<br />\nedged 1-0 by a tough Washington College team.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense was at its usualfine level,<br />\nbut the game saw little in the way of a strong Jay<br />\noffensive attack. \"The front line didn't shoot enough,\" were co-captain randy Miller's words.<br />\nThe first half was mostly a see-saw battle for<br />\npossession of the ball. There was little offensive<br />\npunch on either team. The Blue Jay booters didn't<br />\nget any shots off in this half while Washington got<br />\noff 3.<br />\nAfter the halftime intermission, the Hopkins<br />\noffense woke up only slightly, still attemptingonly<br />\ntwo shots at the Washington goal. The Sho'men<br />\npicked their attack up somewhat as they had ten<br />\nshots in this half.<br />\nThe Jays defense led by John Clisham and Steve<br />\nWeiss had saved the Loyola game, and the team<br />\nseemed content to let them do it again. However,<br />\nas one observer said, \"The defense could only do<br />\nso much for so long.\"<br />\nWashington's goal came on a powerful kick by<br />\nhalfback Barry Drew. The shot from outside the<br />\npenalty area went over the Hopkins defense and<br />\ncurved towards the left side of the net. Goalie<br />\nSteve Weiss got a hand on the ball, but it spun off<br />\nhis fingertips and went into the net with 5:15 elapsed in the fourth quarter.<br />\nThe goal gave the Sho'men renewed spirit as<br />\nthey played inspired soccer from them on.<br />\nthey played inspired soccer from then on.<br />\nHopkins coach Bob Knauff commented on the<br />\ngame,\" On the whole the team played a fine ball<br />\ngame.

Defensively, they were, at one time during the season, ranked number two among all colleges in the United<br />\n<br />\nIS<br />\n<br />\nen<br />\ns,<br />\n<br />\nStates.<br />\nThey received that rating after they defeated Haverford<br />\non October 11, 31-12, and only allowed the Fords a net<br />\nof nine total yards while dumping the'Ford running backs<br />\nfor losses totalling 69 yards. Since Haverford, the Devils<br />\nhave won two and lost two.<br />\nUrsinus nipped Dickinson last Saturday by pulling out a<br />\n21-20 victory in the fourth quarter. However, Ursinus<br />\nscored its points on Devil fumbles and blocked punts. They<br />\ndid not rack up much yardage against Dickinson's defense,<br />\nbut they boosted their record to 4-2 and standing to third<br />\nplace.<br />\n<br />\nay<br />\n<br />\n3k<br />\n,k<br />\nS.<br />\n<br />\not<br />\nk.<br />\n<br />\nDevil Line Heavy<br />\nThe Devil defense is spearheaded by a five man line,<br />\naveraging well over 200 pounds. Led by 6-5, 230 pound<br />\nall-conference tackle Greg VanDoren, they have limited<br />\ntheir opponents running yardal to incredibly low amounts.<br />\nThe line has turned its opponents' good plays into losses<br />\nand has been instrumental not only in destroying its rivals'<br />\nrushing but in recovering fumbles, and blocking passes and<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nPROFESSORS AND<br />\nGRADUATE<br />\nSTUDENTS<br />\nOpportunity for an allexpenses paid trip to<br />\nEurope as an escort for a<br />\nstudent tour.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nFor information call<br />\n358-9556<br />\n<br />\npunts.<br />\nThe Red Devils have a strong although erratic offense.<br />\nThe passing attack is paced by quarterback Joe Wilson, and<br />\nhis favorite receiver, John Person.

The Dickinson offense is, basically, a running game helped along by its defense.<br />\n<br />\nStrong Running Game Needed<br />\nAlex Sotir, Head Coach of the Blue Jays, stated in a<br />\nrecent interview, that overcoming the strong defenses of<br />\nDickinson and \"establishing a strong running game\" will be<br />\nthe major force behind the game's outcome. Backs Dan<br />\nAugustine, Steve Hata, and Steve Utz will be doing the bulk<br />\n<br />\ncompetition and will guarantee the Jays at least a piece<br />\nof the championship. But they will be facing the strongest<br />\ndefense they've seen yet. Still, their opponents,the Devils,<br />\nhave lost their last two games,to Wilkes and Ursinus, and<br />\nmay be unable to pick themselves up tomorrow.<br />\nLast year, the Blue Jays routed Dickinson, 4'7-6, with<br />\na powerful offensive demonstration. Tomorrow, the Jays<br />\nwill have to establish their attack, especially on the<br />\nground, early in the game to repeat.<br />\n<br />\nof the running.<br />\nAccording to Sotir, the Blue Jays \"will try to play a<br />\ngame similar to last Saturday's game\" in which the Jays<br />\nmaintained a balanced attack in smashing Swarthmore,<br />\n26-0. The passing attack of the Blue Jays has been considerably weakened by injuries to Dave Pickall and other<br />\nreceivers. Bobby Pfieffer threw, on the average, over 250<br />\nyards a game passing yardage in the first half of the season.<br />\nAgainst Carnegie-Mellon on November 1, the passing<br />\nupset,<br />\nattack was practically nullified as the Jays were<br />\nhe<br />\n42-0.

Few<br />\nunions have ever tried to organize here<br />\nand none have succeeded. Now,two unions<br />\nare battling for the right to bargain for<br />\nHopkins workers.<br />\nemployees<br />\nare<br />\nNonprofessional<br />\nassured of a choice between a union and<br />\nno union. The question of which union is<br />\nnot in their hands.<br />\nTwo weeks ago,after protracted negotiations, the University signed a Consent<br />\nElection Agreement with Local 1231 of<br />\nthe Amalgamated Municipal Employees<br />\nUnion. They agreed to hold a union representation election on December 5 on the<br />\nHomew000. and East Baltimore campuses.<br />\nLocal 1199E of the Hospital andNursing Home Employees Union petitioned<br />\nthe Maryland Labor Commission late<br />\nlast week to intervene and to permit it a<br />\nplace on the ballot also.<br />\nUnless 1231 and the University agree<br />\nto put 1199 on the ballot, the case will be<br />\ndetermined by Maryland Labor Commission Chairman Henry Miller, in consultation with the State Attorney General's<br />\noffice. Mr. Miller pledged a decision by<br />\ntoday. No word had come by late last<br />\nnight.<br />\nA combination of forces has traditionally worked against unionization of<br />\nHopkins non-professional employees. As<br />\nan institution, Hopkins wields enormous<br />\n<br />\npolitical and economic influence in the<br />\nstate. As a university, it is not bound by<br />\nNational Labor Relations Board guidelines. Finally; Maryland labor law, on<br />\nwhich Mr. Miller will base his decision,<br />\nIs literally full of holes.<br />\nThe whole question of Local 1199's<br />\nright to intervene is not touched by the<br />\nlaw. \"Ordinarily,\" Mr. Miller contends,<br />\n\"this would be a jurisdictional dispute to<br />\nbe settled by the unions.\" He conceded<br />\nthat he \"doesn't know how it(the petition<br />\nfor intervention in a consent election)will<br />\ngo.\"<br />\nUniversity Informed<br />\nMr. Robert Kerley, Hopkins Vice<br />\nPresident for Administration and chief<br />\nlabor negotiator, declined official comment on the 1199 issue, but acknowledged<br />\nthat the University had been informed of<br />\nthe petition.<br />\nKerley has stated repeatedly: \"We don't<br />\nintend to run an anti-union campaign and<br />\nwe don't intend to run a pro-university<br />\ncampaign.\" Mr. Joseph Rumberger,<br />\nDirector of Personnel Services and the<br />\nsecond member of the University's bargaining team, confirmed Mr. Kerley's<br />\nsentiments. \"We are not anti-union,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nNevertheless, the University has held<br />\nseveral meetings with supervisory personnel, who are excluded from the bargaining unit, dealing with the question of<br />\nunionization.<br />\nIn the past, Mr. Claxton has expressed<br />\n<br />\nfears that the University is using supervisors to intimidate its non-professional<br />\nemployees. Maintenance and service<br />\npersonnel depend on their immediate<br />\nsupervisors for evaluations leading to<br />\n\"merit\" wage increases and promotions.<br />\nIn a special bulletin prepared by Mr.<br />\nRumberger and entitled \"Questions and<br />\nAnswers for Guidance of Supervisors and<br />\nEmployees,\" the University presents the<br />\nfollowing exchange:<br />\n\"O. If I have questions about the union<br />\ncan I go to my supervisor for the answers?<br />\nA. Yes. It is part of your supervisor's<br />\njob to provide information for his employees on anything related to their work<br />\nsituation. ..He and other University officials will maintain an impartial attitude<br />\nabout the question of unions. The University feels that its role is to inform its<br />\nemployees as honestly and completely as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nMr. Claxton of Local 1231 accuses the<br />\nUniversity of \"fighting a guerilla campaign\" against his union.<br />\nAll Out Battle<br />\nLocal 1199 representatives question<br />\nMr. DiFebo's contention that Local 1231<br />\nis locked in an \"all out battle with the<br />\nUniversity.\" Lois Moore, a 1199 organizer, says that she is \"personally\" convinced that 1231 is a \"sweetheart union.\"<br />\n(A 'sweetheart' union is a union that<br />\nbetrays the workers it seeks to represent<br />\nby making secret deals with the em-<br />\n<br />\nployer. The union promises not to ask the<br />\nemployer for too much, if the employer<br />\npromises not to fight the uniontoo hard.)<br />\nAdministration<br />\nsources<br />\nReliable<br />\nstated that administrative-higher-ups<br />\npressured\u2022University Chaplain Chester<br />\nWickwire yesterday to cancel two preplanned 1199 organizing sessions<br />\nat<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nMrs. Moore (of 1199) and University<br />\nVice President Kerley confirmed the<br />\ncharges. \"We asked them to move it,\"<br />\nKerley said.<br />\nHe conceded that it<br />\n\"amounts to the same thing\" as a prohibition.<br />\nHe contends, however, that if the<br />\nUniversity had permitted the meeting to<br />\ntake place, it \"would be in violation\" of<br />\n\"item 21\" of the Consent Election Agreement.<br />\nUnder Item 21, \"the University and the<br />\nUnion both agree that neither will solicit<br />\nor encourage the support of any other<br />\npersons or organizations. .. and that<br />\nneither will authorize, instigate or condon demonstratins against the University or the Union...\" These are the only<br />\nobligations of the University in item 21.<br />\n\"Conciliatory Towards 1231\"<br />\nWhereas Mr. Claxton talks of \"war,\"<br />\nMr. Fred Punch, Area Director of Local<br />\n1199 regard the University's actions in<br />\nthe role of employer as suspiciously<br />\n\"conciliatory\" towards 1231.<br />\n\"It's not fair if our members have no<br />\nchance to express themselves,\" ob(Continued on page 12)<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nThe Patriots...<br />\nVeterans Day took on new significance this year as the<br />\nmembers of \"the silent majority\" displayed their support<br />\nof President Nixon's Vietnam policies alongside their<br />\nAmerican flags.<br />\nIn response to Nixon's appeal for support of his Vietnam policies last week, many of his supporters drove with<br />\ntheir automobile headlights on or flew the Americanflag.<br />\nDespite the appeal for support, most demonstrations,<br />\nparticularly on the west coast and the north,were sparsely<br />\nattended.<br />\nIn Washington about 7,5000 persons assembled at the<br />\nWashington Monument Tuesday to hear war critics castigated by speakers. David Packard, Deputy Secretary of<br />\nDefense, placed the traditional Presidential wreath onthe<br />\nTomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery while<br />\nMr. Nixon made a handshaking tour of the Veterans Administration hospital in the District of Columbia,Tuesday.<br />\nOnly 1,500 persons turned out at the 100,00-seat Los<br />\nAngeles Memorial Coliseum to hear five-star general<br />\nOmar Bradley. In Pittsburg the veterans invited the general public to join intheir march, but only 300 did so. The<br />\nNew York City veterans could only amass 1,000 marchers<br />\ndown Fifth Avenue.<br />\nIn Pensacola, Florida, however, the Veterans parade<br />\nwas the largest in the city's history. And in Sioux Falls,<br />\nS.D., the chief speaker at a \"Day of Support\" rally was<br />\nEd McGaa, veteran of 110 combat missions over Vietnam.<br />\nHe told the audience: \"We must support our President in<br />\na united effort and demonstrate to the world that America<br />\nis still, as in 1776, the hope of the free world.\"<br />\n<br />\n...And the Dead<br />\nUnited States casualties in the Vietnam war could reach<br />\n300,000 by the end of November--a figure approaching<br />\nAmerican losses in World War I--if the North Vietnamese<br />\nand Viet Cong maintain the fighting tempo begun last week.<br />\nFrom January 1, 1961, to the beginning of this month,<br />\n39,232 U.S. servicemen have been killed in the war and<br />\n257,509 have been wounded, for a total of 296,741 casualties.<br />\n<br />\n'Commie Clamor' Drug Kickbacks<br />\nThe Nixon Administration stepped up its attack on antiwar protestors Monday, while two leading Senate critics<br />\nof the war in Vietnam announced that they would speak at<br />\nthe mass rally in Washington tomorrow.<br />\nVice -President Agnew in a speech in Philadelphia called<br />\nthe demonstrators a \"carnival inthe streets,\" performed<br />\nby a \"strident minority\" who raise \"intolerant clamor and<br />\ncacophony.\" Meanwhile in New York Transportation Secretary John Volpe claimed that the demonstrators were<br />\nbeing organized by people whowere \"Communist or Communist-inspired.\"<br />\nSenators Charles Goodell of New York and George<br />\nMcGovern of South Dakota issued a joint statement Monday that they would address the rally at the Washington<br />\nMonument. McGovern praised the intentions of the Moratorium organizers, and denounced Agnew and the Justice<br />\nDepartment for what he called \"provocative and inflammatory statements that tend to polarize public opinion.\"<br />\nThe Vice-President asked the \"silent young majority<br />\nwho go to school and to work and to war if necessary,\"<br />\nto \"make itself heard and come to its own defense.\" He<br />\nadded, \"I, for one, will not lower my voice until the restoration of sanity and civil order allows a quiet voice to<br />\nbe heard once again.\"<br />\n<br />\nDraft Deal<br />\nAdvocates of a broad draft reform agreed this week to<br />\naccept the administration's limited lottery-draft proposal,<br />\nclearing the way for Senate action on the House-passed<br />\nlegislation within two weeks.<br />\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, leader of the forces which<br />\nhad sought more sweeping reforms than those proposed<br />\nby the President, agreed to yield to a requirement of the<br />\nArmed Services Committee barring any amendment to<br />\nthe draft-lottery bill. Kennedy later said he agreed to the<br />\ncompromise after being assured that the new draft laws<br />\nwould be in effect next year.<br />\n<br />\nIt will take 3,259 more U.S. casualties to reach 300,000,<br />\na figure that is about 20,000 short of American casualties<br />\nin World War I. The number of Vietnan1 war casualties<br />\nlong ago exceeded the 157,530 men killed or wounded in<br />\nthe Korean War.<br />\n<br />\nInstead of choosing the oldest men first, as is now required by law, the sequence of call of the proposed system<br />\nwould be determined by putting each of the 365 birthdays<br />\nInto a hat and drawing at random. The random -selection<br />\nprocedures would be coupled with picking 19-year-olds<br />\nfirst.<br />\n<br />\nAmerican commanders expect the enemy to step up<br />\nactivities over the next few weeks,and saythat it is more<br />\nthan likely that U.S. casualties will reach the 300,000<br />\nmark. During the relative lull inthe war last month, 3,013<br />\nAmericans were killed or wounded.<br />\n<br />\nFor example, if May 3 were the first date selected, local<br />\ndraft boards throughout the country would call all those<br />\neligible men born on that day before moving to a second<br />\ndate, picked also at random, and so on. The new legislation would not affect student or occupational deferments.<br />\n<br />\nHospital and nursing homes are demanding and receiving<br />\n\"kickbacks\" from drugstores to provide prescriptions<br />\nunder Federal health programs, a spokesman for the<br />\nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association claimed this week.<br />\nJacob W. Miller, chairman of the association's public<br />\naffairs committee, testified before the House Ways and<br />\nMeans Committee that cash was passed under the table<br />\nfrom drugstore owners to institutions to win lucrative<br />\ndrug contracts in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Miller said that the kickback demands was being made \"in<br />\nevery state.\"<br />\nThe kickback practice has contributed to the high costs<br />\nof drugs, Miller stated, because the druggist normalY<br />\nraises his prices to other customers to meet the kickback cost. \"The most bitter complaints we have received<br />\nare from pharmacists who have, in fact, been subjected<br />\nto kickback demands,\" Miller added.<br />\nNearly $50 million in prescriptions are dispensed<br />\nannually to nursing homes and other extended care facilities under the Medicare program. In turn, the hospitals<br />\nare reimbursed for the \"in patient\" drug costs. A Medicare patient who is not hospitalized cannot be reimbursed<br />\nfor his drug costs.<br />\n<br />\nMarch Permit<br />\nFederal authorities and anti-war leaders agreed Tuesday on a compromise route for the mass protest march<br />\non Saturday which will allow demonstrators to parade for<br />\n2 1/2 hours along Pennsylvania Avenue but not past the<br />\nWhite House.<br />\nGranting the Pennsylvania Avenue route was a major<br />\nretreat for the government. Last Friday the Justice Department, warning of a \"substantial likelihood of serious<br />\nviolence,\" flately barred such a route. The government<br />\nand representatives of the New Mobilization Committee<br />\nto End the War in Vietnam had been at an impasse for<br />\nmore than a week over the marching permit.<br />\nMayor Walter Washington has been creditedwith breaking the deadlock. On Monday he met with President Nixon<br />\nand assured t e President that the city is well-prepared<br />\nto handle the influx of anti-war protestors. A statement<br />\nreleased by the deputy U.S. attorney general claimed that<br />\n\"the probability of any marked violence has now been<br />\nmaterially reduced\", without elaborating on their \"information\" last week that some protestors intended to provoke disorders.<br />\nMeanwhile, paratroopers began landing this week in<br />\nWashington to be ready for possible disorders over the<br />\nweekend. About 2,000 paratroopers are stationed in the<br />\ncapital area to supplement the 9,000 District of Columbia,<br />\nNational Guardsmen assigned for the Moratorium demonstrations.

Jim Archibald,one of<br />\nthe principal student organizers, stressed his \"hesitancy over ever dealing with<br />\nthe administration again.\"<br />\nAs a result of the work done by Manuel<br />\nRodriguez and Jim Archibald, both Hopkins<br />\nundergraduates,<br />\nLincoln<br />\nand<br />\nGordon, Noam Chomsky, professor of<br />\nlinguistics at M.I.T., Herbert Dinerstein,<br />\nprofessor at the Hopkins School of International Studies, W. Averell Harriman,<br />\nsenior career diplomat and former governor of New York, and Lincoln Gordon<br />\nwill participate in a panel discussion in<br />\nShriver Hall at 8 p.m. tonight.<br />\nDr. Gordon first approached Rodriguez<br />\non October 26 with the idea of a panel<br />\ndiscussion around the time of the Novem -<br /><br />\nber moratorium, on \"how to get out of<br />\nVietnam.\" Dr. Gordon envisioned the<br />\ndiscussion as one on a high intellectual<br />\nlevel and presenting various points of<br />\nview on the war. Dr. Gordon felt that this<br />\nbalance had been lacking at the October<br />\nMoratorium Teach-In.<br />\nIn the following week it was decided<br />\nthat the Student Association would sponsor the panel, and that both the students<br />\nand the administrationwould each submit<br />\na list of possible speakers for the panel.<br />\nThe next week, Frederick DeKuyper,<br />\nExecutive Assistant to the president,<br />\nsubmitted to the students the names of<br />\nthree SAIS professors. The student organizers indicated that they were thinking<br />\nalong the lines of Professor Richard<br />\nPfeffer of Political Science, but hadn't<br />\nyet drawn up any list.<br />\nOn Tuesday the 4th, the panelwas tentatively decided for Wednesday (Nov 12),<br />\nwith Dinnerstein, Harriman,and Pfeffer.<br />\nNone of the speakers had been confirmed<br />\nat this time. Governor Harrimanwas included in the panel when Rodriguez stressed the necessity of having a \"drawing<br />\ncard\" or major speaker to attract the<br />\nstudents.<br />\nThe next day it was discovered that<br /><br />\nHarriman could not make the panel on<br />\nWednesday but would be available for<br />\nalmost anytime on Thursday or Friday.<br />\nAt this point the panel was moved to Friday.<br />\nWednesday night, the students approached Pfeffer to participate on the<br />\npanel. He declined for various reasons<br />\nand suggested a number of people they<br />\ncould try. This led to Archibald and Rodriguez calling Chomsky at his home at<br />\nmidnight in order to invite him. Chomsky<br />\nstated that he would come if itwas physically possible for him to get to Baltimore<br />\nafter an afternoon speech at Cornell<br />\nUniversity. He agreed to call back at 11<br />\nthe next morning to confirm it.<br />\nThursday morning at 9:30 Archibald<br />\ninformed Gordon over the phone that<br />\nPfeffer would be unable to make it, but<br />\nthat the students had been able to secure<br />\nChom sky. Gordon,it is reported by Archibald, became \"quite disturbed,\" and<br />\ninsisted that Archibald call Chomsky off.<br />\n\"It's your mistake,\" Gordon is reported<br />\nto have said, \"You call him off.\" Archibald explained that he was not empowered<br />\nto do that on his own, and would have to<br />\nspeak to Rodriguez.<br />\nLater that morning, while awaiting<br /><br />\nChomsky's phone call, Rodriguez indicated to DeKuyper that if they could arrange a meeting with Gordon before<br />\nChomsky called back, the situation might<br />\nbe straightened out. DeKuyper stated that<br />\nGordon was in a very important committee meeting, and that the earliest time<br />\navailable would be 2 :15 in the afternoon,<br />\nwhich was after Chomsky's verification<br />\nwas expected. Chomsky was contacted<br />\nthat morning and verified by Rodriguez<br />\nand Archibald.<br />\nThe afternoon meeting was between<br />\nGordon, Archibald, and Rodriguez. Dr.<br />\nGordon has refused to discuss the content of this meeting, insisting that it was<br />\n\"a private discussion.\" The events of the<br />\nafternoon became a matter of public record in that Rodriguez and Archibald<br />\nwere required to report to the Student<br />\nAssociation Cabinet.<br />\nAccording to the two students at the<br />\nmeeting, Gordon charged that the students displayed a gross lack of courtesy,<br />\nto him, but more importantly, to Governor Harriman. He felt that the two had<br />\n\"violated the ground rules\", in that they<br />\nhad agreed to get Pfeffer, and didn't consult him on their change of plans.<br />\n(Continued on page 4)<br /><br />\nSymposium Panel on CBW Remains Unreconciled<br />\nBy ART LEVINE<br />\nA speech linking criticism of the military to an \"international Communist<br />\nconspiracy\"<br />\nhighlighted Wednesday's<br />\nMilton S. Eisenhower Symposium panel<br />\non chemical and biological warfare<br />\n(CBW).<br />\nColonel Norman Shapira, former head<br />\nof CBW for the Combat Developments<br />\ndivision of the Army's Institute of Special<br />\nStudies, declared that CBW was important for a strong national defense that<br />\nwould help us resist the \"slavery, poverty and perversionwhich are the historical facts of Communism.\" The panel at<br />\nShriver Hall also heard Seymour Hersh,<br />\nauthor of Chemical and Biological Warfare: America's Hidden Arsenal, and<br />\nCongressman Richard McCarthy (D-NY)<br />\ncriticize<br />\nchemical and<br />\nbiological<br />\nweapons.<br />\nCongresman McCarthy of Buffalo,<br />\nN.Y., the leading Congressional critic of<br />\nCBW, lambasted the weapons as dangerous and unnecessary. Noting that the<br />\nDefense Department has allocated $400<br />\nto $600 million for CBW in 1970, he outlined some of the weapons now being<br />\nstockpiled, including the deadly VX nerve<br />\ngas, and infectious plague toxins. The<br />\nCongresman charged that biological weapons are \"unreliable, uncontrollable, and<br />\nunpredictable\" and could lead to a worldwide epidemic.<br />\nMcCarthy said that according to testirnony by a member of the Army's Chemical and Biological Research division,<br />\nthere were plans to develop a synthetic<br />\ndisease that would be able to resist all<br />\nantibiotics. Development of this biological weapon has not gone ahead, McCarthy<br />\nsaid, because funds were cut this year<br />\nfor chemical and biological weapons.<br />\nDefoliants and Protocol<br />\nAlthough he criticized the use of tear<br />\ngas as an adjunct to lethal weapons,<br />\nCongressman McCarthy said that we<br />\nShould maintain a deterrent capability<br />\nin deadly chemicals for a limited time.<br />\nHe said, however, that we should abandon<br />\nbiological weapons unilaterally. He also<br />\ncriticized the use of defoliants as harmful to ecology and human life. He pointed<br />\nto Cancer Socity research that showed<br />\nbaby rats were born deformed as a result of their mothers' contacts with the<br />\ndefoliant 245-L.<br />\nCongressman McCarthy observed that<br />\nthe United States and Japan are the only<br />\ntwo major countries that haven't signed<br />\nthe Geneva Protocol of 1925, which bans<br />\nthe use of chemical and biological weapons. He said we have not made it clear<br />\nWhether or not we Will use these weapons<br /><br />\noffensively, and thus, he charged,we are<br />\neroding the restraint of the 1925 pact.<br />\n\"The Geneva Protocol of 1925,\" he said,<br />\n\"is one of the few successful cases of<br />\nmankind getting together to limit weapons. We can build other arms-control<br />\nagreements on this one.\" He added,<br />\n\"The United States should ratify the<br />\nGeneva Protocol.\"<br />\nSeymour Hersh analyzed the history<br />\nand present set-up of the CBW program,<br />\ncharging that it was filled with \"doubletalk and double-think.\" He led off his<br />\ncomments with an anectode about a doctor working in CBW who introduced himself by saying, \"Hi! I'm in plague.\"<br />\nIn World War I, Hersh noted, 1.3<br />\nmillion people were killed by poison gas.<br />\nHe said that the use of this gas escalated during that war. In 1936 the Germans developed nerve gas, but it wasn't<br />\nuntil the 1950's, Hersh said, that the<br />\nU.S. started a full scale build-up of CBW<br />\nwith the help of German and Japanese<br />\nscientists. Extensive secrecy has always surrounded the development of<br />\nthese weapons, Hersh contended.<br />\n(Continued on page 7)<br /><br />\nRep. Richard McCarthy, Seymour Hersh, and Col.

Speaking at the conference were Dr.<br />\nLincoln Gordon, Dean Carl Swanson,who<br />\nis chairman of a Task-Force committee<br />\nappointed to study the problems involved<br />\nin implementing co-education, William<br />\nBrinkley, Director of Admissions, and<br />\nRoger Faxon, a junior who is onthe Task<br />\nForce.<br />\nGordon stated that admitting upperclass transfer students does not pose the<br />\nkinds of problems that opening admissions to women of the freshman level<br />\nwould entail, mainly that of housing. He<br />\nhas appointed the task force to examine<br />\nthe problems involved, and report back<br />\nby February 1, 1970. The school's twoyear residency requirement ruled out the<br />\npossibility of admitting senior transfers.<br />\nIt is generally expected that between<br />\n50 and 75 women will be admitted on this<br /><br />\ntransfer basis. Brinkly felt that\"50 could<br />\nbe counted on,\" but he wasn't sure about<br />\nmore than that. He had received two calls<br />\nthat morning from womenwho expressed<br />\ninterested in transferring. According to<br />\nBrinkly, most interest has been from<br />\ngirls interested in the sciences.<br /><br />\nLocal Girl::<br />\nSwanson denied that this set-up would<br />\nrule out the admission of women as freshman next year. He pointed out that even<br />\nwithout housing, local freshman girls<br />\ncould be admitted. All of these questions,<br />\naccording to Swanson, would be decided<br />\nby the Task Force, whichwould probably<br />\ngive two recommendations, one for next<br />\nfall and another long-range plan.<br />\nMr. Brinkley, while stating that the admissions office is ready to accept any<br />\ntransfer applications, pointed out that<br />\nit has no provision for taking women's applications for the freshman<br />\nclass. He did not feel that it would be a<br />\ngood idea to accept applications from<br />\ngirls who had been informed that they<br />\nmight not be able to come due to lack of<br />\nfacilities, but he did feel that if any decision to admit freshman women was<br />\nmade at a later date, the February 1<br />\ndeadline for receiving applications could<br /><br />\nbe waived.<br />\nAll present emphasized that the move<br />\nto co-education would not cut down on the<br />\nexchange programs with Goucher College. It was hoped that the program could<br />\nbe expanded and perhaps inaugurated with<br />\nother schools, such as the Maryland<br />\nInstitute of Art.<br /><br />\n\"Healthier Environment\"<br />\nSwanson, who commented that co-education would provide \"a healthier learning environment,\" pointed out that the<br />\nTask Force was not prepared to investigate the philosophy of undergraduate<br />\neducation. He stated that \"We are not a<br />\ntypical Liberal Arts college,\" due to<br />\nheavy emphasis on graduate work, with<br />\nmost undergraduates planning to go on<br />\nto graduate school of some kind. Hopkins, according to Swanson, provides \"an<br />\nenvironment of scholarship, and if you<br />\nprovide that and have limited resources,<br />\nyou cannot provide much else.\"<br />\nBesides Swanson and Faxon, the Task<br />\nForce committee consists of Dr. James<br />\nC.

The purpose<br />\nof this letter is to put those reports in<br />\nperspective.<br />\nAs you know, it occurred to me about<br />\ntwo weeks ago that in view of the great<br />\ninterest in the University community<br />\nconcerning the war in Vietnam, it might<br />\nbe useful to stimulate a serious discussion of the difficult and complex question<br />\nof how to extract ourselves from that<br />\nwar.<br />\nMy original notion was that this should<br />\nbe a panel discussion among qualified<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins faculty, including both SAIS and the Faculty of Arts<br />\nand Sciences. I wanted to assist in the<br />\narrangements only if there were substantial student interest in the idea, and<br />\ntalked with several students about it.<br />\nMessrs. Archibald and Rodriguez of the<br />\nStudent Association responded with enthusiasm. I asked Dr. Bevan to explore<br />\nwith SAIS and the Homewood Department<br />\nof Political Science whether faculty<br />\nmembers might be interested in participating in such a discussion.<br />\nOn November 4, Messrs. Archibald and<br />\nRodriguez met with Dr. Bevan and me to<br />\ntalk about the appropriate timing for the<br />\npanel and its composition. The student<br />\nspokesmen urged very strongly that an<br />\noutside figure of national prominence be<br />\nsecured in order to draw a large attendance. We discussed several possible<br />\nnames, and agreed that the best would be<br />\nGovernor Averell Harriman, whom I<br />\nthought I might persuade to come on the<br />\nbasis of our long-standing personal acquaintance. The other two panelists were<br />\nto be from SAIS and the Department of<br />\nPolit.Lcal Science, and I also agreed to<br />\njoin as a commentator on the other presentations.<br />\nOn November 5,1 ascertained that Governor Harriman could not come on<br />\nNovember 12; the date originally proposed, but could come either November<br />\n13 or 14.In a meeting with Messrs. Archibald and Goldberg that afternoon we<br />\nagreed that I should invite Harriman for<br />\nFriday, November 14. It was still understood, at least in my mind, that the other<br />\ntwo panelists would be Johns Hopkins<br />\nfaculty members. On Thursday morning,<br />\nNovember 6, I arranged the date of<br /><br />\nwithout any consultation with me, the<br />\nstudents had invited Dr. Noam Chomsky<br />\nof M.I.T. as a member of the panel.Since<br /><br />\nDr. Chomsky is a nationally known figure,<br />\nnot on the Johns Hopkins faculty, it<br />\nseemed to me that this was altering the<br />\ncharacter of the panel discussion and<br />\nchanging the basis onwhich I had secured<br />\nGovernor Harriman's acceptance. I felt<br />\nit discourteous to me not to have been<br />\nconsulted before inviting another outside<br />\nspeaker, and discourteous to Governor<br />\nHarriman to be changing the agreed arrangements without first consulting with<br />\nhim. My initial reaction was that,in these<br />\ncircumstances, Dr. Chomsky should be<br />\n\"disinvited.\"<br />\nThat afternoon, Messrs. Archibald and<br />\nRodriguez came back to explain to me at<br />\nlength why they felt Dr. Chomsky should<br />\nnot be \"disinvited.\" There followed a<br />\nrather heated conversation, the outcome<br />\nof which was an agreement on my part<br />\nto see whether Governor Harrimanwould<br />\naccept the revised panel composition. I<br />\nreached him that evening, and he graciously agreed to the new arrangements. I<br />\nam looking forward to what,I expect to be<br />\na highly enlightening and lively discussion.<br />\nIn the future, in order to avoid similar<br />\nmisunderstandings, I shall try to have the<br />\nbasis of respective action in cooperative<br />\nenterprises made even clearer than I<br />\nthought it was in this case. I shall also<br />\nseek a better understanding as to whether<br />\na private office conversation is intended<br />\nto be a subject for publication.<br />\nSincerely yours,<br />\nLincoln Gordon, President<br /><br />\npic by hoffinatm<br /><br />\nGordon and Students \"Pleased\" But....<br />\n(Continued from page 3)<br />\nclarified his<br />\nlater<br />\nDr. Gordon<br />\n\"peanut\" statement by explaining that he<br />\nwas referring to Pfeffers' national stature. He also explained that he felt that<br />\nthe agreement was that the panel members would be faculty members, and<br />\nHarriman had been approached with this<br />\nunderstanding.<br />\nThe group finally worked out that they<br />\nwould explain the situation to Governor<br />\nHarriman, and if he would not sit on the<br />\npanel with Chomsky, Chomsky would be<br />\nasked to cancel.<br />\nRodriguez suggested that if that were<br />\nthe case, possibly the SA should not sponsor the event, and that it should be sponsored by the Administration.<br /><br />\nDr. Gordon felt that such action would<br />\ndestroy \"his hopes of ever working with<br />\nstudents on such a project again.\"<br />\nThat evening, Harriman agreed to sit<br />\non the panel with Chomsky, Dinnerstein,<br />\nand Gordon.<br />\nThe students pointed out the late hour<br />\nat which they had talked to Chomsky,and<br />\ntheir morning attempt to see Dr. Gordon.<br />\nRodriguez added that he had thought that<br />\nthe requirement was not so much to get<br />\nPfeffer as to obtain a speaker for the<br />\npoint of view which Pfeffer represented.<br />\nGordon reiterated that the agreement<br />\nwas that Harriman was to be the only<br />\ndrawing card, and that he was to face<br />\nPfeffer on the panel. Gordon condemned<br />\nthe students for their gross lack of cour-<br /><br />\ntesy, which he indicated was characteristic of their generation, and insisted that<br />\nthey call Chomsky and cancel his appear ance. He added that he felt the students<br />\nhad<br />\nproceeded in a \"bull-headed<br />\nfashion.\"<br />\nAccording to Dr. Gordon, Governor<br />\nHarriman had agreed under the impression that he was to be the only \"drawingcard\" and that he was going to sit on the<br />\npanel with a faculty member, inparticular Dr. Pfeffer.<br />\nGordon continued that he had high regard for Professor Chomsky, who he felt<br />\nwas on the very highest intellectual level,<br />\nbut that Pfeffer was a different case; he<br />\nwas an \"idiot and a peanut\" according to<br />\nGordon.<br /><br />\nFIND IT HARD<br />\nTO BELIEVE!<br /><br />\n3 \nmg&lt;<br />\nONE PRICE POLICY<br />\nEVERY<br />\nSportcoat<br /><br />\nEVERY<br />\nSUIT<br /><br />\n24 I '39<br />\nValues to $50<br /><br />\nValues to $85<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nSAMPLE STORE<br />\n3031 Oreenmount Ave.<br />\nin Waverly<br />\nOPEN EVERY EVENING<br /><br />\n\u2022CHARG-IT \u2022NAC<br /><br />\n\u2022BANKAMERICAHD<br /><br />\nthere are easier ways to get your message across.<br />\n\u201e.&gt;<br />\n(O. \u2022f\u2022:. \u2022rve<br /><br />\nhM-IVITH CLAMITIa<br />\nTake advantage of our circulation at Homewood, Goucher, Notre Dame,<br />\nHampton House and the Med School.

Comments ranged from \"ridiculous!\" and \"It can't happen here\" to more mild explanations that graduate students are professionals being<br />\npaid for their work full time and will act accordingly. It<br />\nis known, however, that Dr. Robert Parr,chairman of the<br />\nChemistry Department, plans to cut the pay of any graduate<br />\nstudent who is not present during January by 50%. Dr.<br />\nParr also expressed the opinion that graduate study is a<br />\nfull time occupation, but he is the only professor who had<br />\ndecreed formal penalties for non-attendance.<br />\nMost of the work planned for the academic intersession is on a one to one \"independent study\" basis. Although<br />\nthe Academic Council has denied credit for intersession<br />\nwork, many professors indicate that they will allow students to write papers for credit during the second semester on work done during the minimester.Student Council<br />\nattempts to survey the student body and organize courses<br />\nhave been ineffective--a recent poll generated only fifty<br />\nresposes, 70% of those from freshman.<br />\nThe following survey of plans in the making is not intended to be either up to date or complete, but rather to<br />\ngive an indication of the kinds of projects being undertaken<br />\nby students and teachers.<br />\nGraduate students in the Psychology Department are in<br /><br />\nDr. Liebman will move himself and a staff of six students into an office in the Department of Public Works of<br />\nthe City of Baltimore to do a study of snow removal problems that will help the city make intelligent decisions for<br />\nfuture purchases and plans. \"I hope it snows,\" said Dr.<br /><br />\nthe process of compiling a poll taken in psychology sections last week in an attempt to find out what sorts of<br />\nthings students would like to learn in minimester seminars.<br />\nMark Lipsey, who is oreanizing the project, said his committee is \"trying to generate interest\" for intersession<br />\nwork.

Other planned lectures and<br />\ndiscussions include a series on Spanish \"protest poetry\"<br />\nto be lead by Dr. Elias Rivers of the Romance Language<br />\nDepartment, and lectures on \"Current Topics in Biology\"<br />\nsponsored by Dr.Saul Roseman of the Biology Department.<br />\nThe Philosophy Department currently has two separate<br />\nofferings planned. Dr. Maurice Mandelbaum will deliver<br />\ntwo three-hour lectures on the philosophy of Marxism, as<br />\nan extension of his course, Philosophical Classics.

Lauren Walters, who had intended to<br />\naddress the General Assembly on the question of a University Senate, left the meeting \"wondering how we can have<br />\nany confidence in such a method of decision-making as<br />\nthis general assembly.\"<br />\nManuel Rodriguez, another student, wondered aloud<br />\nif \"we are going to have to wait'til next spring's Assembly meeting to determine if there is going to be a committee appointed to consider whether a committee ought<br />\nto be appointed to consider a University Senate.\"<br /><br />\nThe Meeting<br />\nDr. Gordon directed the Assembly to a discussion of<br />\nthe Allied Health Sciences program. The proposal came<br />\nas a result of growing realization of the great shortage<br />\nof nurses and medical technicians at the Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nIt would be an attempt to train people for supervisory<br />\npositions, somewhat below the level of physicians but above<br />\nthe level of today's nurses and medical technicians.<br />\nThe program would involve admitting into Hopkins,<br />\nafter two years of college, students who wish to obtain<br />\nabove-average training for positions as nurses and medical technicians. Those admitted would get their bachelor's degree after two years, and many would hopefully<br />\ngo on for another one or two years to get their Masters'.<br />\nPeople for this program would be recruited from colleges<br />\nthroughout the country, rather than just from Hopkins<br />\nstudents.<br />\nA major advantage of the training of such sub-professionals was that it would reduce the cost of medical care<br />\n(since these subprofessionals would not require as much<br />\ncostly training as doctors), and that it would produce a<br />\ngreater number of trained medical workers than are being<br />\nproduced by current educational methods.<br /><br />\nMany Girls<br />\nDr. Gordon mentioned another advantage of such a program: it would attract to Hopkins many girls who are no<br /><br />\nlonger satisfied to become only R.N.'s but also want<br />\nBachelor's degrees. Gordon said that the Hopkins nursing<br />\nschool is a dying institution, and that such a program<br />\nwould help to revive it.<br />\nThe issue, however, is very contrversial among the<br />\nHomewood faculty. Many question the desirability of the<br />\nprogram, maintaining that first priority should be given<br />\nto the great shortage of doctors by expanding the facilities of the medical school for that purpose.Others wonder<br />\nwhether it will really help to solve the shortage of nurses.<br />\nThe Academic Council recommended that Dean Kimball<br />\nappoint a committee of faculty members to study the relationship between this program and the faculty of the arts<br />\nand sciences. The committee, already appointed, consists<br />\nof Dr. Peter Achinstein of the Philosophy Department-(chairman), Dr. Stanely Corrsin of Mechanics, and Dr.<br />\nCharles Singleton of Humanities.<br /><br />\nAllow Them<br />\nIt has been proposed that these nurses and technicians<br />\nbe allowed to take regular courses at Homewood.Dr. Achinstein said that this, and other aspects of the proposed<br />\nprogram, would pose many questions. He said that he and<br />\nhis committee were investigating these questions, and<br />\nwould report their findings to the Academic Council.<br />\nAmong the problems cited by Achinstein was that of<br />\nexpanding the undergraduate body without lowering its<br />\noverall high quality. He said that there was a question of<br />\nwhether people comparable in ability to Hopkins students<br />\nwould be willing to enter such a program of study, or<br />\nwhether this program should take priority over the attempt<br />\nto admit a substantial number of undergraduate wornen<br />\ninto regular areas of study.<br />\nDr. Achinstein said that the issue was brought up at<br />\nthe General Assembly in order to let the faculty know that<br />\nthe committee was in operation, and that itwould welcome<br />\ntheir suggestions.<br /><br />\nAnd Finally<br />\nThe final issue discussed was the racial integration of<br />\nthe faculty. Individual efforts have been made by various<br />\ndepartments to secure black professors, but all efforts so<br />\nfar have failed. Many faculty members felt that it was time<br />\nto make the issue more public, to generalize it and involve<br /><br />\nLauren Walters has been wondering 1,3w the student<br />\nbody can \"have any confidence in such a method of<br />\ndecision-making\" as the Faculty General Assembly.<br />\nthe entire faculty. This feeling prompted those faculty<br />\nmembers present to pass a resolution, proposed by Dr.<br />\nJohn White, that both faculty and administration assign a<br />\nhigh priority to the integration of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nfaculty.<br />\nDr. Gordon said, \"I don't think that this is a financial<br />\nproblem...It's a matter of finding qualified people.\" He<br />\nstated that efforts to obtain black faculty members would<br />\nhave to be incorporated into the existing set of university<br />\npriorities, which include major space renovations, expanding of student recreational facilities, and maintaining<br />\nlevels of salaries and personnel benefits competitive with<br />\nthose of comparable universities.<br />\nDr. John Walton of the Education Department expressed<br />\nthe opinion that no such integration has ever succeeded<br />\nwithout a definite bias in favor of black candidates for<br />\nfaculty positions. He said, \"We should do whatever we<br />\ncan to attract qualified and needed black professors.\"<br />\nDr. White said, \"There is no real, visible sign that<br />\nthe attitude here (toward blacks) is right...When word<br />\ngets around that Hopkins is really trying,then people will<br />\nwant to come here.\"<br /><br />\n11112.;11112.<br />\n,<br />\n4116a711:1;411Xfictict:41ixotwagazaqv nt;ii bz<br />\nba;411bLt;111,Z.V*46;4.,..Wne,;41111V1111;t:11&amp;;,,e;11$2.<br />\n,<br />\n.<br />\n,<br />\n. ailt.'111W sk.<br />\n:<br />\n;,..;20tcw 6;<br />\n.<br />\nt,4 oz;,/6qiip<br />\n'<br />\n. icezb;4111,1\u2022;111W16;2211/2011;t:11112;111W10;21;46W6;2\u201evo<br />\n...\u201e...,..,,,,,....z.;.w6;,,W11;1;,illift;d6W KW b2b;111Zililt;411W1 W nal<br />\n..,.....;:\u201e<br />\n.<br />\n47:4<br />\n.71 MAIM,MI4:7itr;:t Matr:71,7:4e7:1priN pri:tp^spriNMION C.71j<br />\n\"<br />\nI:;:i47i47.1 rr:74r^ir:<br />\n:1P574 Mi17471<br />\nr747.117<br />\n4<br />\nMt<br />\nP:47147:I44105:1Ms<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nMIMIMI<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n,:;:\u201e.:;:.z;7\u201e:;:\u201e:;:.,:;:.c,:i mii,.. ,<br /><br />\nMI<br /><br />\nMIMI<br /><br />\nMIMI<br /><br />\n.

Many of the people who<br />\ndid not attend classes yesterday, and who demonstrated, did not know<br />\ntheir own views concerning the war in Vietnam and on U.S. involvement<br />\nin the affairs of other nations.<br />\nThis ambiguity aids the Moratorium effort because it allows people<br />\nWith diverse points of view to participate together, and prevents the<br />\nfactionalism which has often hindered the \"peace wing\" in the past.<br />\nThere is no need for the Moratorium to espouse any one opinion on<br />\nU.S. involvement. Thus, you find some moratorium demonstrators calling<br />\nfor larger troop with/drawls and others for an end to U.S. imperialism.<br />\nHowever, for individuals, this ambiguity is counter-proudctive. The<br />\nPurpose of teach-ins and stopping \"business as usual\" is to give people<br />\nand the nation time to think about U.S. involvement in Vietnam so that<br />\nthey can formulate their own opinions. Use the time which you would<br />\nhave spent in class today for some serious thinking as well as demonstrating. Every person who participates in moratorium activities should<br />\nattempt to clarify and express his own position on the war. The<br />\nmoratorium asks America to stop and rethink its attitudes about foreign<br />\ninvolvement and national priorities. If those who participate do not<br />\nthink for themselves as well, the movement becomes dishonest.<br /><br />\nOnly Halfway Home<br />\nMany of the participants in the moratorium seem to be advocating<br />\nthat the troops be brought home--certainly nothing less, but nothing<br />\nmore either. It should be noted that bringing the American troops home<br />\nfrom Vietnam will not solve the problems inherent in the situation--for<br />\nAmerica or for the Vietnamese.<br />\nThe fact is that the U.S. is in Vietnam as a result of its desire to control<br />\n(politically and economically) the destiny of that country and of the<br />\nSouth East Asian people. Contrary to the ever-present rhetoric about<br />\nmaking the world safe for democracy and allowing the Vietnamese the<br />\nright of self-determination, American involvement represents an attempt<br />\nat control. In this case, fighting communism means retaining enough<br /><br />\nIF 4100 ARE- A<br /><br />\nAJV<br /><br />\ntOOT<br /><br />\nslow Htsickey_<br /><br />\nConnive for Complacency<br />\nThe recent actions of President Gordon bring to light his real intentions<br />\nin setting up today's debate. When Noam Chomsky was substituted for<br />\nRichard Pfeffer as a panel member, Dr. Gordon was obviously infuriated.<br />\nIt has become increasingly apparent that Dr. Pfeffer (referred to by Dr.<br />\nGordon as an \"idiot\" and 'pea nut\") was indeed to be used by Dr. Gordon<br />\nas a .foil for Averill Harriman. While this may have been a perfectly acceptable and normal maneuver when Dr. Gordon was at the State Department,<br />\nit is unbecoming in the behavior of a university president.<br />\nDr. Gordon worked with Manuel Rodriguez and Jim Archibald to set<br />\nup today's open forum, ostensibly in good faith and with the desire to<br />\npresent to the Hopkins community a meaningful debate on the moratorium and the war in Vietnam. The question to be answered is whether<br />\nor not Dr. Gordon wanted a debate where both sides would be fairly represented.<br />\nDid he in. fact want one that was weighted heavily toward<br />\nhis point of view? Dr. Gordon was afraid that the imbalance would be<br />\nupset by the presence of Dr. Chomsky, for whom he has the \"highest<br />\nregard\" intellectually.<br />\nThe other unfortunate result of Dr. Gordon's abortive ruse is that his<br />\npopularity and credibility with the faculty will sink even lower. Many<br />\nfaculty members have privately expressed dissatisfaction with the<br />\nPresident. When he makes slanderous i-emarks about a member of the<br />\nfaculty (after much talk about the Hopkins \"community\", it cannot<br />\nserve to aid his image. We hope that people will keep in mind Dr. Gordon's<br />\nactions of the past week and his attitude toward Hopkins professors and<br />\nstudents when he again tries to pass off notions of \"Academic Community\" and the respect due to faculty members.<br /><br />\n.1-e_OUR POLITICS G011,f, PRO-<br /><br />\nva\" CHAOS, AtJAPCHY<br />\nREMsstokl<br /><br />\nIF YOU Ak'5- A<br /><br />\nR11-(TICAt.

That attempt, which is morally<br />\nWrong, will continue long after the last American soldier has left the<br />\ncountry. What is at stake, then, is the commitment of American resources<br />\nin any form to controlling Vietnam. The fact that these resources are<br />\nare desperately needed at home is well known. It ameliorates conditions<br />\nvery little, therefore, when President Nixon offers economic control as<br />\nan alternative to military presence. The question is what the U.S. is'.<br />\ndoing in Vietnam at all.<br />\nIt is important that those who want the troops brought home realize<br />\nwhy they are there and question the premises on which any U.S. foreign<br />\ninvolvement is based.

And indeed it is<br />\na fearful thing to think about tomorrow's March for Peace,<br />\nthe fear of bloodshed, of cracked heads and broken limbs<br />\n(our own), and tear-gassings and god knows what else.<br />\n(Would they dare fire shots into the crowd?)(How can you<br />\ncontain a half-million people in a peaceful posture?)There<br />\nwill be confrontation. It may be peaceful; it probably will<br />\nnot. The odds are not at all favorable: the unarmed army<br />\nis certain to be outgunned: symbols vs. weapons, spit vs.<br />\nmace, pot-smoke vs. tear gas. Yet the unarmed army has<br />\nno choice. It shall take casualties no matter what, and besides it must committed to peace.Peace means no violence<br />\n--for most of the army at any rate, although most is not<br />\nenough. There must be a total suicidal commitment<br />\nto having the shit kicked out of you while singing \"give<br />\npeace a chance.\" Tomorrow Washington must be visited by a half million saints.<br /><br />\nOnly A Fool<br />\nThat the Administration wants violence is clear enough,<br />\nfor only it can profit from violent confrontation. Washington wishes to discredit the peace movement by showing<br />\nthat it cannot remain true to its ideals. The burden of<br />\nproof rests upon those who are not in power. It is not an<br />\neasy task, but it would seem to be one worth trying at least<br />\none last time, just to see if massive peaceful demonstration of a moral position, of a statement of desired national behavior, has any effect whatsoever (in this democratic<br />\nsociety) upon both the people who rule it and the silent<br />\nmajority Sir Richard is always talking about. There can<br />\nbe no mistaking the extent of the peace movement if some<br />\nhalf million people are willing to travel however far to<br />\nparticipate in the demonstration. There is no silent majority, simply a figment of some President's imagination.<br />\nHere is an active vocal representation of areal presence<br />\nin this country that wants a return to peace and national<br />\nsanity. Only a fool could ignore such a demonstration.<br />\nIndeed.<br />\nA few weeks ago The New Republic voiced a tentative<br />\nhope that Mr. Nixon would continue to respect public opinion as he had in the past, yieldingto its whim for the sake<br />\nof a 'clear mandate.' Yet it seems clear that Nixon has<br />\nabandoned that passive role of reading public opinion for<br />\nthe more powerfully active one of making opinion. It was<br />\nreasonably astute of him or one of his advisors to realize<br />\nthat they could indeed reintroduce a kind of anti-propaganda into the President's speeches, whereby the public<br />\ncould be duped into believing that it had made up its own<br />\nmind while it yielded to the Administration's policies.<br />\nAmericans in general do not like the idea of being in the<br />\nminority, and, what with all of those nasty minorities getting everything for nothing, it was about time that majority rule be re-instituted. What they did not know, however, was how the majority of their fellow Americans<br />\nthought. Chances are that their fellow Americans did not<br />\nthink at all, but if they did it seemed to be apparent for a<br />\nwhile (check the Gallup polls of late summer, early fall)<br />\nthat the nation was tired of the war and wanted out. Not<br />\nso, says Mrs. Nixon.<br /><br />\nchannels they let good ol Dick now via good old Western<br />\nUnion.<br />\n\"I have on my desk a pile of telegrams which, when<br />\ncompressed in a vise, make a pile four inches high. I have<br />\nanother collection of telegrams here which,since we only<br />\nhad one vise in the Oval Room,make a loose pile some two<br />\nfeet high. This great disparity in pile heights is a clear<br />\nindication of the mood of the country or I don't know my<br />\npiles.\"<br />\nAnd so Richard Nixon yields to the majority which he<br />\ncreated and which he will let, now, create itself.<br />\n(But there was only a vague minority of cars on Veterans' Day driving duringthe daywith their lights on: is the<br />\nsilent majority also non-visual--or perhaps invisible?)<br />\nTomorrow five hundred thousand people will attempt to<br />\ndsicredit that silently approving majority by showing that<br />\nthe wishful thinking of the president cannot be corporealized--not even in America. Maybe Mr.Average American<br />\nwill decide to change his mind(again),since he has not let<br />\nanybody know how he thought before, and tell himself that<br />\npatriotism and peace can go together; that the flag is a<br />\nsymbol of the people, not the government; that maybe the<br />\nmarchers have a point--if only they'd cut their hair; and<br />\neven that to legitimize this grand movement and protect it<br />\nfrom the commiehippiefaggot elements, Mrs. Average<br />\nAmerica should take it over.<br />\nBut the dreams of the vocal idealist are not likely to be<br />\ncorporealized either -- even in America! Still, like the<br />\nPresident, we must try our best to getwhat we believe in<br />\n(tell me, please, that Nixon really does believe what he<br />\nsays--or even that he knows what he wants).<br /><br />\nBloody Spectres<br />\nYet, how long can we endure. If this demonstration is<br />\nreasonably peaceful, why should the next one be the same?<br />\nIf in March there is still another March on Washington (in<br />\ncommemoration of Norman Mailer), how can anyone<br />\nexpect it to be peaceful if nothing has changed? If this<br />\ncountry refuses to have a revolution of the mind and heart,<br />\nis it then willing to undergo one of the flesh with real bullets and real suffering and real massacres and real loss<br /><br />\nof face?<br />\nThe violins are growing more tortured,the drums deeper and louder. The fear is returning. The bloody spectre<br />\nof the Chicago debacle is resurrected. I do not like the<br />\npain, I do not like the gas,I do not like the mental anguish<br />\nof Chicago returning. We gather for the confrontation as<br />\nwe gather for peace--we are not given an alternative. The<br />\nguns are there and the clubs and the ....<br />\nWe step to the center of the arena and listening to the<br />\nsilence of the crowd, silent in approval, we take a deep<br />\nbreath and smile and mouth the word.<br />\nAnd when it has been consummatedwhatwill it have accomplished? Will it reveal the brutality of the system of<br />\n\"law and order\" for the status quo? Chicago did that: no<br />\none has forgotten. More sufferingwill reveal little that is<br />\nnew. Will it bring sympathy for the peace marcher? Some,<br />\nperhaps, but the silent majority will remain silent regardless of how they feel and will be led (unintimidated, so they<br />\nwill believe) bytheir President. Will it change Nixon's<br />\nmind? A contradiction interms. Hewill read about it in<br />\nthe newspapers (spaced amid the news of the astronauts),<br />\nhear it second hand from his advisors, watch it edited on<br />\ntelevision, and go for a swim. Will it bring peace? No,<br />\nbecause 'the national shall not be shamed into defeat by<br />\nthe North Vietnamese or their American counterparts.'<br />\nThen why go at all, why risk the beatings and the mace<br />\nand the tear gas?<br />\nWe shall go because we have beentaught that silence is<br />\ndamning: the silent majority of Nixon's dream world is the<br />\nsame silent majority we have condemned elsewhere in another country during another war for permitting the continuation of a moral outrage. We are trying to bring peace<br />\nand life into the world, into the minds of our countrymen.<br />\nNothing more. Time will judge us, but at least our children (should they live that long) will know where we stood<br />\nand why.<br />\nWe must go to Washington in peace and do our damndest<br />\nto retain that peace.<br />\nThere can be no neutrality: silence assents to the continuation of the killing in the President's quaint, peaceful,<br />\napproved way. The next Nuremburg will remember that<br />\nsilence.<br /><br />\nBob Sloan<br /><br />\nMr. A. S. A. M. Speaks<br />\nThe majority of the people in this country have been silent and thus have not voiced their opinions concerning the<br />\nwar, but he, Richard M. Nixon, seer of seers, has penetrated that veil of silence and has discovered that the silent majority will support the President in his endeavors<br />\ntoward peace. Of course we do, Mr.Average Silent American Majority says to himself, that's what I've thought all<br />\nalong. And since they are a kind of people who believe in<br /><br />\n\"... the unarmed army is certain to be outgunned: symbols vs. weapons, spit vs. mace, pot-smoke vs. tear gas.

If Bryan were to be<br />\na viable candidate in the future, he would<br />\nhave to demonstrate his party loyalty by<br />\neffusions of support for Justice Parker.<br />\nAlthough Bryan had not considered this<br />\nthe most opportune time to pursue his<br />\nthird nomination,it was generally believed that he had not abandoned his ambitions. During certain speeches, he was<br />\nintroduced as a \"future President of the<br />\nUnited States.\"<br />\nBryan's party loyalty was espcially<br />\nsuspect because of an incident of 1893.At<br />\nthat time President Cleveland, a Democrat decided to respond to the current<br />\nPanic by checking inflation; his method of<br />\nattack was to recommend to a Democratic Congress the repeal of the Sherman<br />\nSilver Purchase Act. The Sherman Act<br />\nbore the name of a great Republican, and<br />\nhad been passed with the help of certain<br />\nProminent Republicans in Congress, among them William McKinley. (This is<br />\nnot to say there was a solid Republican<br />\nfront for the Sherman bill; House deaker<br />\nThomas B. Reed was a prominent dissenter)<br />\n.<br /><br />\ni an Democracy. (When he finally became<br />\nSecretary of State, Bryan was not notably<br />\nsuccessful in establishing a Christian<br />\nforeign policy-but that is another story).<br /><br />\nTeddy Even Worse<br />\nThese facets of Bryan's attitude may<br />\nbe seen in his Missouri campaign swing<br />\nof early October. He announced that foreign policy was the greatest issue of the<br />\ncampaign, and that in this issue Justice<br />\nParker was demonstrably superior to<br />\nPresident Roosevelt. Since Bryan was<br />\nnot given to dissembling, he failed to display flaming enthusiasm for Justic Parker. He did remark that, in those areas<br />\nwhere Parker was wanting, Roosevelt<br /><br />\nwas even worse. With slightly more effort, Bryan might have been as deep a<br />\nparty loyalist as Senator Hill.<br />\nBryan's 1904 speeches really show no<br />\ngreat aptitude for discussion of Justice<br />\nParker. However, Bryan did retain the<br />\ngreat talent of his earlier years,the ability to discuss himself. Once he was introduced as the Moses of the Democratic<br />\nparty, and modestly said that Moses had<br />\nbeen a poor speaker and God had assigned Aaron to speak for Moses, so Bryan<br />\nwould have to describe himself as the Aaron of the party. Here Bryan was calling<br />\nattention to the fact that Parker was not<br />\nspeaking for himself and Bryan as a party<br />\nloyalist had shouldered the burdent of<br /><br />\nspeaking for him. The implied comparison of Justice Parker with Moses is interesting, but analysis must be left to<br />\nthose more profound than myself.<br />\nBryan's grudging support of Parker<br />\nwas manifested in several speeches, in<br />\nwhich the Boy Orator advertised himself<br />\nrather than his party's candidate. It is<br />\nreasonably clear that Bryan had an interest in seeing Justice Parker decimated,<br />\nsince he would then be in position to regroup his own forces for 1908. Throughout 1904, both advocates and opponents of<br />\nBryan could easilty perceive the reality<br />\nbehind the gessamer facade of Democratic unity.<br /><br />\nEd Mendelsohn<br /><br />\nBLACK POWER<br /><br />\nBryan was a second-term pre-silver<br />\nRepresentative from Nebraska, and he<br />\na nnounced that due to Cleveland's policy<br />\nhe might\"serve my country and my God\"<br />\nelsewhere than in the Democratic party.<br />\nPresumably he was thinking of the Popwhose support he sought a year<br />\nlater, when he opened an ill-fated camPaign for the U.S. Senate. At the time he<br />\nth reatened apostacy, Bryan was far from<br />\na household word. The incident became<br />\nPublicized just as Bryan was organizing<br />\nhis 1896 campaign, Senator David B.Hill<br />\nW as murmuring that \"I am a Democrat<br />\nstill-very still,\" and Bryan was piously<br />\ndeprecating such callous lack of party<br />\nloyalty. It also developed that in one election, when the Democratic candidate was<br />\nbat to his liking, Bryan has simply<br />\n'scratched\" the ticket.<br />\nContrived Support<br />\nIt is evident that, unless Bryan could<br />\ncontrive a semblance of enthusiasm for<br />\nJ ustice Parker, the depth of his party loYaltY would be exposed; that is, he would<br />\nbe seen to favor unity among Democrats<br />\nso long as the Presidential candidate was<br />\nrYan. Bryan's difficulty was that his enthusiasm for Justice Parker was<br />\nParable to the feelings felt by a worm on<br />\nthe approach of an early bird. This was no<br />\nsecret in 1904, and was indeed strongly<br />\nindicated by Bryan's myriad remarks at<br />\nthe National Convention which have already been adequately discussed. In<br />\n191-2, when he was entirely free of the<br />\nniceties and restraints imposed by the<br />\ncontest of 1904, Bryan remarked that the<br />\nforces which prevailed at the 1904 Convention were \"reactionary.\"<br />\nHowever, it should not be thought that<br />\nBryan convertly desired the success of<br />\nPresident Roosevelt. It is true that in<br />\n1908 Bryan, aware of the tremendous<br />\nPoPularity of the outgoing President, attempted to style himself as the progenitor of the Roosevelt policies. One reMarkable feature of Bryan's 1908 camPalgn was that the issue offoreign policy<br />\nWhich bulked so large in his effort of 1900,<br />\ncommanded little of his attention. (Twill<br />\nProbably explain this, eventually). In<br />\n1904, Bryan's statements still indicated a<br />\ndeep concern with foreign policy, and<br />\nhere he considered himself irreconcilably at odds with Roosevelt. In Bryan's<br />\neyes, Roosevelt was an imperialist,while<br />\nthe Nebraskan's foreign policy was based<br />\non goodwill and other Christian precepts,<br />\nPlus the general tolerance to other<br />\nPeople which Bryan read into Jefferson-<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\nThe Pioneer SX 440, striking in black,<br />\ncan give you all the power you could<br /><br />\never ask for<br /><br />\nat black market prices.<br /><br />\nAfter All, Black IS Beautiful<br />\nSTORE HOURS<br /><br />\nCUSTOM MUSIC .SYSTEMS<br /><br />\nSTEREO<br /><br />\nSTERN<br /><br />\nMON. 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.<br /><br />\n\"<br />\nHI<br />\nFIDELITY<br />\n106 W.

Claxton, according to Punch,<br />\nsaid at the time: \"I stake my life and<br />\nreputation on it (the \"guarantee\").\"<br />\nStar Studded<br />\nBy comparison, Local 1199 has had a<br />\nmore star-studded career than 1231.<br />\nPunch's local represents about five thousand Baltimore workers, including all<br />\nmaintenance and service personnel at<br />\nHopkins, Sinai, Franklin Square, and<br />\nMaryland General Hospitals and numerous nursing homes. Most of these contracts were won within the year.<br />\nClaxton's Local, on the other hand, has<br />\nlost all of its fights to date. The Local<br />\nwas founded in March, 1968.<br />\nHowever, the situation is reversed in<br />\nterms of the University. Claxton has been<br />\nable to call his support \"overwhelming,\"<br /><br />\nbut only three workers attended 1199's<br />\ntwo off-campus meetings, Wednesday.<br />\nBoth sets of union leaders contend that<br />\ntheir interest in organizing Hopkin's<br />\nworkers is \"humanitarian.\" Punch and<br />\nMrs. Moore promised not to press intervention unless it is the wish of a large<br />\nnumber of workers.<br />\nMr. DiFebo of Local 1231 (Laborers'<br />\nInternational) contends that 1199 is<br />\nclearly in the wrong and should not intervene. \"One AFL-CIO affiliate should respect the other\". \"We've honored them.<br />\nWe expect them to honor us.\"<br />\nOn one point at least, Local 1231 and<br />\nthe University seem to agree. As Mr.<br />\nDiFebro put it: \"We don't want to put<br />\ndoubts in the worker's minds.\"<br />\nLocal 1199 arrived at Hopkins late.<br />\nIt did not begin a concerted Organization<br />\nattempt until last week.It has been overly<br />\npreoccupied with negotiations at Hopkins<br />\nHospital and organizing the Greater<br />\nBaltimore Medical Center.<br /><br />\nacross the Mississippi at St. Louis.<br />\nHoodlums on the bridge project, including<br />\nShoulders, \"toted guns.\" One union<br />\nmember was slain gangland fashion on the<br />\njob site Dec. 3, 1964, \"presumably for<br />\ngetting out of line.\" Two union officials<br />\nwho protested the hiring of certain hoodlums were brutally beaten and ordered<br />\nout of town \"within 48 hours.\"<br />\nIn January, 1968, the Public Employee's Division of LIU was certified as the<br />\nbargaining agent of the Hartford Convalescent Home in Bloomfield, Conn. However, no contract followed the certification.<br />\nIn July of 1968, the Home was sold to<br />\nAMCARE Centers, Inc. Still no contract<br />\nensued. Workers at the Home wrote the<br />\nLIU, informing them of the worsening<br />\nconditions and asking for the union to step<br />\nin. The Regional LIU Manager, Vincent<br />\nDiNunno, replied that the Home was quite<br />\npoor and would be unable to imprve wages and conditions.

In<br />\nbehalf of Bufonidae, the Hyladae<br />\nand the Renadae, to mention only<br />\nthe most numerous groups, I demand an apology for this undeserved slur. I catagorically deny that<br />\nany frog, or toad for that matter,<br />\ncould possibly turn into Richard<br />\nNixon under any circumstances<br />\nWhatsoever.

Its purpose is to provide a better screening process<br />\nfor those undergraduate candidates who wish to participate in<br />\nthe committees.<br />\nThe only changes the amendment makes are in the selection<br />\ntime of the interviewing committee (moving it from the autumn to<br />\nthe preceding spring) and in the<br />\nnumber of candidates recommended by the screening committee to the Student Council.<br />\nThe committee is eminently more<br />\nqualified to adjudge the better<br />\ncandidates since it has been able<br />\nto thoughtfully consider each applicant.<br />\nI would therefore like to correct an erroneous statement that<br />\noccurred in the November 7<br /><br />\nBill Canis '72<br /><br />\nMORATORIUM NO. 1<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe October 15th Moratorium<br />\nwas indeed a success. It attracted the support and backing of a<br />\nspectrum of American<br />\nwide<br />\nI society. It was spearheaded by<br />\nthe students and youngpeople who<br />\n\u2022 have been in the forefront of the<br />\npeace movement for years.It was<br />\n\u2022 particularly heartening to see that<br />\nthousands of housewives, businessmen, and a large segment<br />\nof a previously 'silent minority'<br />\nwere taking a stand on the issue.<br />\nHopefully, the November anti-war<br /><br />\nactivities will demonstrate even<br />\nstronger opposition to our government's policies. However,it<br />\nis imperative that the issue of the<br />\nwar in Vietnam be viewed within<br />\nthe greater context in which it<br />\noccurs.<br />\nFor our tragic war policy is<br />\nmerely a symptom of a far greater sickness permeating many<br />\naspects of American life. Perhaps this sickness is best manifested in the uresponsiveness of<br />\nour governmental institutions today to basic human needs and<br />\nrights. Inequities, injustices,<br />\npoverty, brutality, destruction,<br />\nand racism.These words can only<br />\ninadequately describe the conditions and situations to which all<br />\nAmericans should address themselves.<br />\nThere is a vital linkage, then,<br />\nbetween the Vietnam War and<br />\nother deep social problems. If<br />\nthe issue of the war is divorced<br />\nfrom the larger context in which<br />\nit should be viewed, as unfortunately many anti-war demon-<br /><br />\nPHALLIC<br /><br />\nstrators would have it, then indeed a naive and simplistic outlook has been adopted. One need<br />\nonly look at the hesitancy of the<br />\nleaders of the black community<br />\nin Baltimore to throw their full<br />\nenergies in support of the Moratorium. For they may legitimately claim that many of the<br />\nanti-war protestors, once the war<br />\nhas finally ended (or after the<br />\nissue has died), will triumphantly state \"we won,\" as if the major<br />\nsocietal ill had finally been cured. The ending of the war in Vietnam should only signal the initiation of a far greater commitment<br />\nby all concerned Americans to<br />\nthe great struggle that lies ahead<br />\nat home.

HOELSCHER<br />\nAfter 44 years of government vacilation, the Hopkins Medical School has<br />\ntaken steps to force ratification of the<br />\n1925 Geneva Protocol.<br />\nFrederick Henderson, a medical student and Chairman of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Institutions Students for Peace,<br />\nhas sent personal letters to over 150<br />\nmedical schools in the United States,<br />\n\"urgently\" requesting that letters be<br />\nsent to every Senator and calling for<br />\npassage of the Protocol in the Senate.<br />\nThe Geneva Protocol calls for all signatories to aid in preventing the use of<br />\npoisonous or bacteriological agents in<br />\ntime of military action. Although most of<br />\nthe nations of the world signed the post\u2014<br />\nWorld War I accord,the Protocol has<br />\nbeen pending in the United States Senate<br />\nfor many years.<br /><br />\nDeeply Troubled<br />\nHenderson stated that he was \"deeply<br />\ntroubled by the priorities of a government<br />\nwhich slashes funds for legitimate medical research while continuing to support<br /><br />\nthe research and development of CBW agents.\" He indicated the need for institutions of medical education to put themselves on record as firmly opposed to CBW.<br />\nActivity at the Hospital was mirrored<br />\nin Washington. Shocked by recent publicity on the storage and testing of CBW<br />\nagents, 98 Congressmen and 20 Senators<br />\nhave sponsored resolutions urging President Nixon to push the ratification of the<br />\nProtocol.<br />\nIn addition to the Students of Peace,<br />\nHenderson is involved with the Medical<br />\nCommittee for Human Rights.. The Committee was formed by students concerned<br />\nover the possibility of violence in Washington during the Moratorium.The Committee Will provide a \"neutral medical<br />\npresence\" tomorrow.<br />\nDaryl Matthews, recruiter and coordinator for the Hopkins contingent, described the purposes of the Medical Committee for Human Rights(MCHR)effort<br />\nas \"care for anyone in need.\" Some 20 to<br />\n40 medical and nursing students prepared<br />\nfor the demonstrations Wednesday night<br />\nin a crash course of first aid. The course<br />\nis being given by Dr. Norman Hollingsworth, Associate Professor of Anaesthe-<br /><br />\nq9 A BALLANTINE THREE RING THING 99<br /><br />\nsiology at the Medical School.<br />\nIn addition to providing _care to the<br />\ninjured, medical students will pass out<br />\nblack armbands to those students marching in Washington. There is a similar attempt to collect sufficient funds to place<br />\nan add in the Sunpapers called both for support of the Moratorium and an end to biological research and development.<br />\nOrganizers of the Committee expressed surprise at the lack of support for the<br />\nMoratorium shown by medical students at<br />\nHopkins. Henderson noted that initial estimates of student support showed that<br />\nover 200 students planned to march in<br />\nWashington. By yesterday, however,the<br />\nnumber had dwindled to less than 50.<br />\nHenderson stated that the fear of violence probably scared many of the students.<br />\nMedical Aid<br />\nThe students and professionals still<br />\nplanning to participate in the Washington<br />\nmarch will be joined by similar groups<br />\nfrom other medical schools across the<br />\ncountry. Medical aid is being rendered<br />\nat three satellite stations throughout<br />\nWashington on Friday and at eight stations on Saturday. These satellite facilities, which will be set up in local church-<br /><br />\nes, are complemented by a pool of cars,<br />\nrigged as mobile first aid vehicles to answer special calls for aid. These vehicles<br />\nare to be controlled by a central unit.<br />\nSuch comp19:: arrangements have not<br />\nyet been tried by the medical school. Last<br />\nOctober, the Medical Students for Peace<br />\nmarched from the Hopkins Plaza, downtown to City Hall. There,they assembled<br />\nfor an afternoon of speeches by such nat\u2014<br />\nional figures as former Alaskan Senator<br />\nErnest Gruening and Mrs. Martin Luther<br />\nKing.<br />\nGruening and former Senator Wayne<br />\nMorse of Oregon were the only opponents<br />\nof the 1965 Gulf of Tonkin resolution. The<br />\nformer Alaskan senator was one of the<br />\nmost adamant early spokesmen against<br />\nthe Vietnam War.<br />\nIn an interview, Matthews, a third year<br />\nmedical student, pointed out that the style<br />\nof medical care delivery will differ drastically from previous violent demonstrations. Previously, medical personnel,<br />\nweighted down by equipment and supplies,.<br />\nwere among the least mobile persons in<br />\nthe crowds. They were therefore very<br />\nsusceptible to injury during the confrontations.<br /><br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br /><br />\nThe Student Union Board of The University of<br />\nMaryland<br /><br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br /><br />\nPRESENTS<br /><br />\nfor the finest italian food in town<br /><br />\n3320 Greenmount Ave.<br /><br />\nL111111101311<br /><br />\nJEN S<br /><br />\nS 5<br />\n.47$4N.<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLEBURGERS<br />\nEAT-IN OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

We believe that<br />\nthe students at this university and<br />\nany other university have the<br />\nmoral and constitutional right to<br />\nactively demonstrate their concerns in a peaceful manner, to<br />\npetition grievances to the government of the United States, and to<br />\norganize as a leading stimulus for<br />\npeace.<br />\nWithin the framework of free<br />\nspeech<br />\nand assemblage, we<br />\nwholeheartedly agree that this<br />\nuniversity's administration has<br />\nthe duty to recognize and respect<br />\nthe student assemblage that will<br />\noccur on November 13,14 and 15.<br /><br />\nThe Jewish Students'Association<br /><br />\nROTC REVIVAL<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn my letter of last week on<br />\nROTC, a phrase omitted in publication changed the sense of the<br />\nfollowing statement that should<br />\nread: \"The data shows that student participation in ROTC in the<br />\n\u2022 1930's and again in the 1950's<br />\nranged from 260-435 per year,<br />\nand the number of officers commissioned from the program<br />\nranged from 28-52 per year.\"<br />\nRecall that in the 1930's, the total<br />\nundergraduate<br />\npopulation ran<br /><br />\nabout 800-900 and in the early<br />\n1950's about 1300-1400.

I personally participated in a long<br />\nmeeting in which the chapter<br />\nagreed not to lead any general<br />\nheckling of the Senator. Most of<br />\nus felt that our point would be better made by asking questions<br />\nabout his work in the Senate that<br />\nwould cut through his polite<br />\nfacade and expose him as the<br />\ncriminal that he is. We agreed<br />\nalso, to a silent comment on the<br />\nSenator's racist role in Congress<br />\nin the form of two figures dressed<br />\nas Ku Klux Klansmen on either<br />\nside of the stage. We were informed the morning before the speech<br />\nthat the Motherfuckers planned to<br />\nattend and heckle. We voted, as I<br />\nsaid above, not to lead heckling<br />\nwith them. Let it be clear to you<br />\nthat SDS has no control over any<br />\nother group on or off campus, nor<br />\nde we feel we should try to exert<br />\nsuch control.<br />\n2) My second point is directed<br />\nat those people at Hopkins and<br />\nelsewhere who saw fit to expend<br />\namazing amounts of energy taking votes, writing letters and<br />\nbustling about in general in order<br />\nto condemn the \"rudeness\" of the<br />\n\"hecklers.\" If this is the best<br /><br />\nBARTHELME DEFENDED<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIf you are to have someone<br />\nreview a book as important as<br />\nDonald Barthelme's Unspeak-<br /><br />\nable Practices, Unnatural Acts,<br />\nyou might be sure that he is aware<br />\nthat UPUA was Barthelme's third,<br />\nnot second book. The first, Come<br />\nRack, Dr. Caligari, is published<br />\nin paperback by Anchor. Also,<br />\nhe might have read beyond the<br />\ncover pages of Snow White.<br />\nThe cover was a typical Bantam<br />\nsexploitation of a strictly nonporno experimental novel. Anyway, I can understand not liking<br />\nUPUA; it's a very strange book.<br />\nSo strange in fact that value<br />\njudgement is perforce arbitrary<br />\nand premature. It's like nothing<br />\never written before, and anyone<br />\nseriously interested in the contemporary short story should<br />\nread Barthelme without delay.<br /><br />\nElliot Krieger '70<br /><br />\nGRAD PRIORITY!<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIn enthusiastic agreement with<br />\nB.L.'s letter opposing coeducation at Hopkins, I would like to<br />\naddress a few thoughts to this<br />\nso-called \"liberal community of<br /><br />\nscholars.\" First: Bringing women to Hopkins while it remains<br />\nessentially a training ground for<br />\nfactory--robot chem-throats is<br />\nabsurd. Symptomatic of these<br />\nconditions is the case of Dr. William H. McClain. When he came<br />\nto this quasi-RAND-like processing think-tank, Dr. McClain was<br />\nthe entire Department of Hummanities. There are still no departments of music or fine arts.<br />\nThe History Department only recognizes America. The English<br />\nDepartment services for undergraduatps are symbolized in the<br />\npopular renaming of its prized<br />\nseminal book, J. Hillis God, The<br />\nDisappearance of ,ililler. The<br />\nlanguage departments possess<br />\nthe comprehensiveness of a good<br />\nhigh school. It is a clinched truth<br />\nthat the humanities at Hopkins<br />\nare simply there for show. As<br />\nsuch, the aura of ravishing fair<br />\nyoung maidens billowing down<br />\nthe valleys of the quads is a myth.<br />\nThe real nightmare must be faced. The Women brought to Hopkins<br />\nwould only be more of the same-torturous eyesore\u2014i.e. a<br />\na<br />\nfemale version of the C Level<br />\ntechnocrat grinding away...0h<br />\nwere are the beautiful souls?<br />\nSecond: A sociological dimension. The present sexual deprivation of J.H.U. serves a \"subversive\" interest. The Defense Department and technological corporations need a \"managerial<br />\nelite\" that is composed of calm,<br />\ncool, cold \"clean machines.\"<br />\nBut the social mood that infects<br />\na large part of Hopkins does not<br />\nbreed \"normal\" controlled people. To be sexually denied now<br />\nwill lead to resentment, rebellion and aggressive behavior<br />\nlater. This psychological situation may produce General Curtis<br />\nLeMay's but can only embarrass<br />\nthose sophisticated merchants of<br />\nsystems analysis who speak<br />\ncalmly of megadeaths in a nuclear<br /><br />\nwar. Of course, paradoxically,<br />\nthis deprivation does aid the machine interests by fostering\"I-it\"<br />\nrelationships. It leads to a feeling<br />\nof naturalness in being fake, a belief that people are objects. This<br />\nWeltanschauung is a prerequisite<br />\nto being a corporate manager. All<br />\nthe while, these people will piously proclaim the beauty of art, supporting it as a \"cultural accountrement\" to a \"civilized<br />\nsociety.\" To conneect the weaving flows: The lack of coeducation at Hopkins hurts its ability<br />\nto function as a high quality technicist institute. Thus,the absence<br />\nof women will help put a wrench<br />\ninto the conveyor belt.<br />\nThird; A rather pessimistic<br />\ntangent, I guess; an attempt to<br />\nburst the endless layers of gauze<br />\nthat substitute a pseudo -reality<br />\nfor life. Soon, The Little Prince<br />\nwill be a big commercial movie.<br />\nAll is absorbed by the vacuum<br />\ncleaner; the centrifuge is constantly at work, discarding the<br />\ndredge of culture. As I walk down<br />\nthe tree lined routes, I feel<br />\nstrangely unreal and detached-so estranged. I seem to just float<br />\nabove the quad and laugh ever so<br />\nsadly as I watch the patterns of the<br />\nsmall groups interacting, skilled<br />\nin the frauds of social grace. In<br />\nfascination, I walk and dream and<br />\nobserve the game players.Sornehow the word \"romantic\" and the<br />\nenvironment \"Hopkins\" will always seem mutually exclusive.<br />\nBut, alas, we must stop the conceit. The humanities student, that<br />\npresentable piece of fluff, is unfair to the technicist men and<br />\ngirls.<br />\ncomputer-programmed<br />\nHe affects a studied superiority<br />\ncomplex because he usually succumbs to feeling uptight. He<br />\npreaches the romantic way and<br />\nreads Keats and studies Picasso<br />\nbut laughs (else he would cry)<br />\nwhen he sees the reality of Baltimud that lies beyond the Georgian<br />\n.(Continued on page 17)<br /><br />\nThe only book of its kind!<br /><br />\nThe New Guide<br />\nto Study Abroad<br />\nby JOHN A.

If the<br />\nadministration does not feel that<br />\nthe complainant has been wronged--and only students can be<br />\ncharged with wrongdoing--there<br />\ncan be no action taken against<br />\nthe student. If, on the other hand,<br />\nthe administration agrees that the<br />\nstudent has erred, it may sanction him. The student may then<br />\nappeal any sanction to an appeals<br />\nboard; an appeal is automatic for<br />\nthe sanction of suspension.<br />\nThus the appeals board will<br />\nbe charged, whenever it meets,<br />\nwith upholding or overturningthe<br />\nverdict of the administration. An<br />\nadministrator sits as a voting<br />\nmember, along with three-Stu-<br /><br />\nBest Folk Music in<br />\nBaltimore<br /><br />\ndents and three faculty members,<br />\non the appeals board. But the<br />\nadministration wishes to reserve<br />\nthe right to overturn any decision of the appeals board. Thus,<br />\nthe administration is involved in<br />\nall stages of the judicial process.<br />\nIt seems to me that there are<br />\nglaring sources of bias in this<br />\nprocedure. It does not alter the<br />\npresent absence of methods for<br />\ndealing with faculty and administration harassment of students,<br />\nas occurred with respect to the<br />\nOctober 15th teach-in. It does not<br />\npermit a student with a complaint<br />\nto do anything about the complaint<br />\nwihtout his enlisting the administration's agreement. It does<br />\nnot allow a student to be judged<br />\nby his peers without his first<br />\nbeing declared guilty by the administration. By giving the administration a veto over the appeals board's recommendations,<br />\nit<br />\ngreatly limits the board's<br />\npower.<br />\nThis new conduct policy has<br />\nbeen hailed as a vast improvement over Hopkins' present judicial system which contains no<br />\nappeals procedure. But the ability<br />\nof the administration, in the new<br />\ndocument, to prejudice a case<br /><br />\nagainst a student, in the new<br />\nagainst a student, to participate<br />\non the appeals board, and to<br />\noverturn any decision by that<br />\nboard, leads me to believe that<br />\nthe new document gives us nothing more than the appearance of<br />\nchange.<br /><br />\nbut undermines any sense of community by calling for justice to<br />\nbe administered from above, and<br />\nnot by one's peers.

In previous weeks,the most unanswerable question was? \"What<br />\nwent wrong?\" Yet last Saturday's second half performance pushed<br />\nsuch questions into the background.<br /><br />\nFans Brave Weather<br />\nAnyone of the few diehard Hopkins fanswho braved the weather and<br />\ncould afford the university's unrealistic admissions charge could see<br />\nthat Sotir's suspicions had been put aside when linebacker Paul Weiss<br />\nsnagged an errant Mike O'Neal pass and ran it back 40 yards from<br />\nHopkins' third touchdown of the afternoon.<br />\nUnlike Lloyd Eaton of Wyoming and John Pont of Indiana who have<br />\nhad their conference and bowl bids upset by racial and disciplinary<br />\nstrife, Alex Sotir is riding high.<br />\nJust as Red Auerbach used to light up his victory cigar. Sotir broke<br />\nout a similar victory smile after Weiss's interception and score.<br />\nHopkins's 4-1 MAC record is the best inthe Southern Division, and<br />\nthe mightly Black and Blue go.after a piece of the MAC Sothern Division Crown for an unprecedented third straight year.<br />\nHow did the Blue Jays put it all together? To answer this question<br />\none must turn the clock back to the Jays' first loss of the season against Ursinus. After this 19-14 setback, the format of practice was<br />\nchanged.<br />\nThe result was that the young team as a whole was more tense and<br />\nfelt compelled to win or else be punished in the following week's practice. Back-to-back losses to Hampden-Sydney and Carnegie-Mellon proved that more hittingwasn't the answer. Of course it is doubtful as to whether or not the team would have won these ball games if<br />\nthe format had not been changed.<br />\nNevertheless, Coach Sotir showed the flexibility that has endeared<br />\nhim to his players when the team returned to its former format a week<br />\nago last Tuesday. This move restored much of the team's confidence,<br />\nand at the end of the week Sotir felt the club \"had turned the corner.\"<br /><br />\nMomentum With Jays<br />\nIn tomorrow's contest at Dickinson, one has to give the momentum<br />\nto the Jays. Dickinson,whose defense had been nationally ranked, suffered a humiliating 49-0 loss to Wilkes College followed by a slim 2120 Homecoming loss to Ursinus last Saturday. Dickinson thereby<br />\ndropped out of contention for the coveted MAC crown.<br />\nAfter one of Sotir's spirited pep talks last week, one player mused:<br />\n\"I wonder if he stays up all night figuring out what he's going to say to<br />\nthe team or whether the talks are just off the cuff?\"<br />\nIt doesn't matter that Hopkins probably won't get a chance to play<br />\nin the first Knute Rockne Bowl. For when the team leaves the locker<br />\nroom at Carlisle tomorrow afternoon, one thought will be dominant.<br />\n\"LET'S WIN THIS ONE FOR LEX!\" In an era, when there seems to<br />\nbe an equal amount of victimization of coaches by players as players<br />\nby coaches (an era, which the Varsity footballteam has luckily escaped) could Charley Eckman or Vince Bagli have put it any better?<br /><br />\nBIA NOTES<br />\nJennings House, behind the running of John Karos and brilliant lineplay of Dave Williams,stunned Clark 21-7 for the Freshman Dormitory Championship last week on Levering Field. Karos scored twice,<br />\nfirst on kick-off return and then running back a Clark punt. Williams<br />\nconstantly harassed the Clark quarterback and prevented many scores.<br />\nJennings' third touchdownwas scored by Brad Hallwig on a pass interception. Two Allen Schreiber to Pugatch conversions and one from<br />\nSchreiber to Karos accounted for the remaining 3 points. Clark scored on pass from Don Krohn.<br /><br />\nPrice Wins Gallop<br />\nRay Price from Phi Gam won the Goucher Gallop for the fourth<br />\nstraight year.

All the Blue Jay<br />\nscoring took place in the second half, leading to<br />\na rout of the weak, but battling Swarthmore club.<br />\nThe first half of the contest was dull, neither<br />\nteam sustaining an offensive drive. The half<br />\namounted to an exchange of punts between the two<br />\nteams. Hopkins did come as close as the Swarthmore 14 yard line, where however, the drive was<br />\nhalted as a fourth down pass from quarterback<br />\nBob Pfeffer fell incomplete.<br />\nSwarthmore, a team which had won only one<br />\ngame, succumbed to the stronger Blue Jays, in<br />\nthe second half. Swarthmore had little depth and<br />\nbench strength, many of its squad playing both<br />\n( Hopkins scored the first time it had the ball<br />\nfollowing a Swarthmore punt, after Swarthmore<br />\nreceived the second half kickoff.<br />\nDan Augustine, who was named by Coach Alex<br />\nSotir as the Blue Jays most valuable offensive<br />\nplayer of the game, hauled in a pass from Bob<br />\nPfeiffer and carried the ball to the Swarthmore<br />\n32 yard line. After a run to the 18 yard line which<br />\ngave Hopkins another first down, Augustine was<br />\nhanded the ball on an option play, and threw to end<br />\nBill Donovan to the three yard line.<br />\nA motion penalty brought the ball back to the<br />\nSwarthmore 8, where on three downs Hopkins was<br />\nunable to move the ball. On fourth down, the Blue<br />\nJays lined up to kick a field goal. Bob Pfeiffer,<br />\nholding on the play, took the snapfrom center and<br />\nfired a pass to Bill Utz for the touchdown.<br /><br />\nTry Fake Field Goal<br />\nThe fake field goal had caught Swarthmore off<br /><br />\nguard. This play,the first Hopkins' score in eleven<br />\nquarters, provided the incentive for the Blue Jays,<br />\nas they began to play a more potent brand of football.<br />\nThe key play of the game for the Blue Jays may<br />\nhave been the 40 yard interception and runback<br />\nof a Swarthmore pass by linebacker Paul Weiss.<br />\nWeiss is the leading groundgainer of the team this<br />\nyear. Weiss who had ankle problems, was not<br />\nactually up to par physically to play fullback.<br />\nThis fine defensive play may then have re -instilled a new spirit in the club which is essential to the Hopkins club winning the conference<br />\ntitle.<br /><br />\nCieslowski Races 63 Yds<br />\nHopkins final score came on a 63 yard run by<br />\nJoe Cieslowski late in the fourth quarter. Cieslowski ran off tackle, made a beautiful cut to<br />\nthe outside, and outraced the Swarthmore defensive backs for the score. Here for the first time<br />\nin three weeks, a smile came to the lips of Coach<br />\nSotir.<br />\nBob Pfeiffer ran the option play for 53 yards in<br />\nthe 3rd quarter to account for the 2nd Hopkins<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nThe execution of the offensive unit was much<br />\nsharper in the second half and the defense played strongly throughout the contest.<br />\nThe game next week against Dickinson is most<br />\ncrucial to the Blue Jays if their hope for a third<br />\nConference title is to be realized. The ability of<br />\nthe offense and defense to make the big play, as<br />\nevidenced in the Swarthmore game, must be repeated in the Dickinson contest. However, the<br />\nspirit and pride of the team has been renewed,<br />\nand this will be a definite factor in Hopkins favor.<br /><br />\nWashington Stifles Hopkins Rooters<br />\nJohns Hopkins varsity soccer team had their<br />\nhopes for a league title ended as the Jays were<br />\nedged 1-0 by a tough Washington College team.<br />\nThe Hopkins defense was at its usualfine level,<br />\nbut the game saw little in the way of a strong Jay<br />\noffensive attack. \"The front line didn't shoot enough,\" were co-captain randy Miller's words.<br />\nThe first half was mostly a see-saw battle for<br />\npossession of the ball. There was little offensive<br />\npunch on either team. The Blue Jay booters didn't<br />\nget any shots off in this half while Washington got<br />\noff 3.<br />\nAfter the halftime intermission, the Hopkins<br />\noffense woke up only slightly, still attemptingonly<br />\ntwo shots at the Washington goal. The Sho'men<br />\npicked their attack up somewhat as they had ten<br />\nshots in this half.<br />\nThe Jays defense led by John Clisham and Steve<br />\nWeiss had saved the Loyola game, and the team<br />\nseemed content to let them do it again. However,<br />\nas one observer said, \"The defense could only do<br />\nso much for so long.\"<br />\nWashington's goal came on a powerful kick by<br />\nhalfback Barry Drew. The shot from outside the<br />\npenalty area went over the Hopkins defense and<br />\ncurved towards the left side of the net. Goalie<br />\nSteve Weiss got a hand on the ball, but it spun off<br />\nhis fingertips and went into the net with 5:15 elapsed in the fourth quarter.<br />\nThe goal gave the Sho'men renewed spirit as<br />\nthey played inspired soccer from them on.<br />\nthey played inspired soccer from then on.<br />\nHopkins coach Bob Knauff commented on the<br />\ngame,\" On the whole the team played a fine ball<br />\ngame. We came to play and wanted the game. We<br />\nweren't able to get as many shots though.It took a<br />\nfine shot to beat us. It was a tough loss, but I hope<br />\nwe will be able to bounce back and take the final<br />\ntwo games of the season.\"<br />\nThe team will have to polish up its offense this<br />\nweek. The line, hampered somewhat by injuries,<br />\nhas not been especially productive in recent games<br />\nand has a long way to go to shape up. Two shots is<br />\njust not enough to win any ball game.The defense<br />\nhas been playing well all season letting in only six<br />\ngoals in eight games, but they cannot be expected<br />\nto carry the whole load.<br /><br />\nThe booters travel to Philadelphia tomorrow for<br />\nan 11:30 game with Drexel Tech.

The Terrors are not an<br />\nespecially strong team, but have played some good<br />\ngames. The Jays will have to expect a tough contest.<br />\nThe Blue Jays are now 5-2-1 for the season,<br />\nand 2-1-1 in the league. The league title is now<br />\nout of reach, because Washington is now 5-1 with<br />\nno more league games remaining.

Since Haverford, the Devils<br />\nhave won two and lost two.<br />\nUrsinus nipped Dickinson last Saturday by pulling out a<br />\n21-20 victory in the fourth quarter. However, Ursinus<br />\nscored its points on Devil fumbles and blocked punts.

Tomorrow, the Jays<br />\nwill have to establish their attack, especially on the<br />\nground, early in the game to repeat.<br /><br />\nof the running.<br />\nAccording to Sotir, the Blue Jays \"will try to play a<br />\ngame similar to last Saturday's game\" in which the Jays<br />\nmaintained a balanced attack in smashing Swarthmore,<br />\n26-0. The passing attack of the Blue Jays has been considerably weakened by injuries to Dave Pickall and other<br />\nreceivers.

Few<br />\nunions have ever tried to organize here<br />\nand none have succeeded. Now,two unions<br />\nare battling for the right to bargain for<br />\nHopkins workers.<br />\nemployees<br />\nare<br />\nNonprofessional<br />\nassured of a choice between a union and<br />\nno union. The question of which union is<br />\nnot in their hands.<br />\nTwo weeks ago,after protracted negotiations, the University signed a Consent<br />\nElection Agreement with Local 1231 of<br />\nthe Amalgamated Municipal Employees<br />\nUnion. They agreed to hold a union representation election on December 5 on the<br />\nHomew000. and East Baltimore campuses.<br />\nLocal 1199E of the Hospital andNursing Home Employees Union petitioned<br />\nthe Maryland Labor Commission late<br />\nlast week to intervene and to permit it a<br />\nplace on the ballot also.<br />\nUnless 1231 and the University agree<br />\nto put 1199 on the ballot, the case will be<br />\ndetermined by Maryland Labor Commission Chairman Henry Miller, in consultation with the State Attorney General's<br />\noffice. Mr. Miller pledged a decision by<br />\ntoday. No word had come by late last<br />\nnight.<br />\nA combination of forces has traditionally worked against unionization of<br />\nHopkins non-professional employees. As<br />\nan institution, Hopkins wields enormous<br /><br />\npolitical and economic influence in the<br />\nstate. As a university, it is not bound by<br />\nNational Labor Relations Board guidelines. Finally; Maryland labor law, on<br />\nwhich Mr. Miller will base his decision,<br />\nIs literally full of holes.<br />\nThe whole question of Local 1199's<br />\nright to intervene is not touched by the<br />\nlaw. \"Ordinarily,\" Mr. Miller contends,<br />\n\"this would be a jurisdictional dispute to<br />\nbe settled by the unions.\" He conceded<br />\nthat he \"doesn't know how it(the petition<br />\nfor intervention in a consent election)will<br />\ngo.\"<br />\nUniversity Informed<br />\nMr. Robert Kerley, Hopkins Vice<br />\nPresident for Administration and chief<br />\nlabor negotiator, declined official comment on the 1199 issue, but acknowledged<br />\nthat the University had been informed of<br />\nthe petition.<br />\nKerley has stated repeatedly: \"We don't<br />\nintend to run an anti-union campaign and<br />\nwe don't intend to run a pro-university<br />\ncampaign.\" Mr. Joseph Rumberger,<br />\nDirector of Personnel Services and the<br />\nsecond member of the University's bargaining team, confirmed Mr. Kerley's<br />\nsentiments. \"We are not anti-union,\" he<br />\nsaid.<br />\nNevertheless, the University has held<br />\nseveral meetings with supervisory personnel, who are excluded from the bargaining unit, dealing with the question of<br />\nunionization.<br />\nIn the past, Mr. Claxton has expressed<br /><br />\nfears that the University is using supervisors to intimidate its non-professional<br />\nemployees. Maintenance and service<br />\npersonnel depend on their immediate<br />\nsupervisors for evaluations leading to<br />\n\"merit\" wage increases and promotions.<br />\nIn a special bulletin prepared by Mr.<br />\nRumberger and entitled \"Questions and<br />\nAnswers for Guidance of Supervisors and<br />\nEmployees,\" the University presents the<br />\nfollowing exchange:<br />\n\"O. If I have questions about the union<br />\ncan I go to my supervisor for the answers?<br />\nA. Yes. It is part of your supervisor's<br />\njob to provide information for his employees on anything related to their work<br />\nsituation. ..He and other University officials will maintain an impartial attitude<br />\nabout the question of unions. The University feels that its role is to inform its<br />\nemployees as honestly and completely as<br />\npossible.\"<br />\nMr. Claxton of Local 1231 accuses the<br />\nUniversity of \"fighting a guerilla campaign\" against his union.<br />\nAll Out Battle<br />\nLocal 1199 representatives question<br />\nMr. DiFebo's contention that Local 1231<br />\nis locked in an \"all out battle with the<br />\nUniversity.\" Lois Moore, a 1199 organizer, says that she is \"personally\" convinced that 1231 is a \"sweetheart union.\"<br />\n(A 'sweetheart' union is a union that<br />\nbetrays the workers it seeks to represent<br />\nby making secret deals with the em-<br /><br />\nployer. The union promises not to ask the<br />\nemployer for too much, if the employer<br />\npromises not to fight the uniontoo hard.)<br />\nAdministration<br />\nsources<br />\nReliable<br />\nstated that administrative-higher-ups<br />\npressured\u2022University Chaplain Chester<br />\nWickwire yesterday to cancel two preplanned 1199 organizing sessions<br />\nat<br />\nLevering Hall.<br />\nMrs. Moore (of 1199) and University<br />\nVice President Kerley confirmed the<br />\ncharges. \"We asked them to move it,\"<br />\nKerley said.<br />\nHe conceded that it<br />\n\"amounts to the same thing\" as a prohibition.<br />\nHe contends, however, that if the<br />\nUniversity had permitted the meeting to<br />\ntake place, it \"would be in violation\" of<br />\n\"item 21\" of the Consent Election Agreement.<br />\nUnder Item 21, \"the University and the<br />\nUnion both agree that neither will solicit<br />\nor encourage the support of any other<br />\npersons or organizations. .. and that<br />\nneither will authorize, instigate or condon demonstratins against the University or the Union...\" These are the only<br />\nobligations of the University in item 21.<br />\n\"Conciliatory Towards 1231\"<br />\nWhereas Mr. Claxton talks of \"war,\"<br />\nMr. Fred Punch, Area Director of Local<br />\n1199 regard the University's actions in<br />\nthe role of employer as suspiciously<br />\n\"conciliatory\" towards 1231.<br />\n\"It's not fair if our members have no<br />\nchance to express themselves,\" ob(Continued on page 12)<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nThe Patriots...<br />\nVeterans Day took on new significance this year as the<br />\nmembers of \"the silent majority\" displayed their support<br />\nof President Nixon's Vietnam policies alongside their<br />\nAmerican flags.<br />\nIn response to Nixon's appeal for support of his Vietnam policies last week, many of his supporters drove with<br />\ntheir automobile headlights on or flew the Americanflag.<br />\nDespite the appeal for support, most demonstrations,<br />\nparticularly on the west coast and the north,were sparsely<br />\nattended.<br />\nIn Washington about 7,5000 persons assembled at the<br />\nWashington Monument Tuesday to hear war critics castigated by speakers. David Packard, Deputy Secretary of<br />\nDefense, placed the traditional Presidential wreath onthe<br />\nTomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington Cemetery while<br />\nMr. Nixon made a handshaking tour of the Veterans Administration hospital in the District of Columbia,Tuesday.<br />\nOnly 1,500 persons turned out at the 100,00-seat Los<br />\nAngeles Memorial Coliseum to hear five-star general<br />\nOmar Bradley. In Pittsburg the veterans invited the general public to join intheir march, but only 300 did so. The<br />\nNew York City veterans could only amass 1,000 marchers<br />\ndown Fifth Avenue.<br />\nIn Pensacola, Florida, however, the Veterans parade<br />\nwas the largest in the city's history. And in Sioux Falls,<br />\nS.D., the chief speaker at a \"Day of Support\" rally was<br />\nEd McGaa, veteran of 110 combat missions over Vietnam.<br />\nHe told the audience: \"We must support our President in<br />\na united effort and demonstrate to the world that America<br />\nis still, as in 1776, the hope of the free world.\"<br /><br />\n...And the Dead<br />\nUnited States casualties in the Vietnam war could reach<br />\n300,000 by the end of November--a figure approaching<br />\nAmerican losses in World War I--if the North Vietnamese<br />\nand Viet Cong maintain the fighting tempo begun last week.<br />\nFrom January 1, 1961, to the beginning of this month,<br />\n39,232 U.S. servicemen have been killed in the war and<br />\n257,509 have been wounded, for a total of 296,741 casualties.<br /><br />\n'Commie Clamor' Drug Kickbacks<br />\nThe Nixon Administration stepped up its attack on antiwar protestors Monday, while two leading Senate critics<br />\nof the war in Vietnam announced that they would speak at<br />\nthe mass rally in Washington tomorrow.<br />\nVice -President Agnew in a speech in Philadelphia called<br />\nthe demonstrators a \"carnival inthe streets,\" performed<br />\nby a \"strident minority\" who raise \"intolerant clamor and<br />\ncacophony.\" Meanwhile in New York Transportation Secretary John Volpe claimed that the demonstrators were<br />\nbeing organized by people whowere \"Communist or Communist-inspired.\"<br />\nSenators Charles Goodell of New York and George<br />\nMcGovern of South Dakota issued a joint statement Monday that they would address the rally at the Washington<br />\nMonument. McGovern praised the intentions of the Moratorium organizers, and denounced Agnew and the Justice<br />\nDepartment for what he called \"provocative and inflammatory statements that tend to polarize public opinion.\"<br />\nThe Vice-President asked the \"silent young majority<br />\nwho go to school and to work and to war if necessary,\"<br />\nto \"make itself heard and come to its own defense.\" He<br />\nadded, \"I, for one, will not lower my voice until the restoration of sanity and civil order allows a quiet voice to<br />\nbe heard once again.\"<br /><br />\nDraft Deal<br />\nAdvocates of a broad draft reform agreed this week to<br />\naccept the administration's limited lottery-draft proposal,<br />\nclearing the way for Senate action on the House-passed<br />\nlegislation within two weeks.<br />\nSenator Edward M. Kennedy, leader of the forces which<br />\nhad sought more sweeping reforms than those proposed<br />\nby the President, agreed to yield to a requirement of the<br />\nArmed Services Committee barring any amendment to<br />\nthe draft-lottery bill. Kennedy later said he agreed to the<br />\ncompromise after being assured that the new draft laws<br />\nwould be in effect next year.<br /><br />\nIt will take 3,259 more U.S. casualties to reach 300,000,<br />\na figure that is about 20,000 short of American casualties<br />\nin World War I. The number of Vietnan1 war casualties<br />\nlong ago exceeded the 157,530 men killed or wounded in<br />\nthe Korean War.<br /><br />\nInstead of choosing the oldest men first, as is now required by law, the sequence of call of the proposed system<br />\nwould be determined by putting each of the 365 birthdays<br />\nInto a hat and drawing at random. The random -selection<br />\nprocedures would be coupled with picking 19-year-olds<br />\nfirst.<br /><br />\nAmerican commanders expect the enemy to step up<br />\nactivities over the next few weeks,and saythat it is more<br />\nthan likely that U.S. casualties will reach the 300,000<br />\nmark. During the relative lull inthe war last month, 3,013<br />\nAmericans were killed or wounded.<br /><br />\nFor example, if May 3 were the first date selected, local<br />\ndraft boards throughout the country would call all those<br />\neligible men born on that day before moving to a second<br />\ndate, picked also at random, and so on. The new legislation would not affect student or occupational deferments.<br /><br />\nHospital and nursing homes are demanding and receiving<br />\n\"kickbacks\" from drugstores to provide prescriptions<br />\nunder Federal health programs, a spokesman for the<br />\nAmerican Pharmaceutical Association claimed this week.<br />\nJacob W. Miller, chairman of the association's public<br />\naffairs committee, testified before the House Ways and<br />\nMeans Committee that cash was passed under the table<br />\nfrom drugstore owners to institutions to win lucrative<br />\ndrug contracts in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Miller said that the kickback demands was being made \"in<br />\nevery state.\"<br />\nThe kickback practice has contributed to the high costs<br />\nof drugs, Miller stated, because the druggist normalY<br />\nraises his prices to other customers to meet the kickback cost. \"The most bitter complaints we have received<br />\nare from pharmacists who have, in fact, been subjected<br />\nto kickback demands,\" Miller added.<br />\nNearly $50 million in prescriptions are dispensed<br />\nannually to nursing homes and other extended care facilities under the Medicare program. In turn, the hospitals<br />\nare reimbursed for the \"in patient\" drug costs. A Medicare patient who is not hospitalized cannot be reimbursed<br />\nfor his drug costs.<br /><br />\nMarch Permit<br />\nFederal authorities and anti-war leaders agreed Tuesday on a compromise route for the mass protest march<br />\non Saturday which will allow demonstrators to parade for<br />\n2 1/2 hours along Pennsylvania Avenue but not past the<br />\nWhite House.<br />\nGranting the Pennsylvania Avenue route was a major<br />\nretreat for the government. Last Friday the Justice Department, warning of a \"substantial likelihood of serious<br />\nviolence,\" flately barred such a route. The government<br />\nand representatives of the New Mobilization Committee<br />\nto End the War in Vietnam had been at an impasse for<br />\nmore than a week over the marching permit.<br />\nMayor Walter Washington has been creditedwith breaking the deadlock. On Monday he met with President Nixon<br />\nand assured t e President that the city is well-prepared<br />\nto handle the influx of anti-war protestors. A statement<br />\nreleased by the deputy U.S. attorney general claimed that<br />\n\"the probability of any marked violence has now been<br />\nmaterially reduced\", without elaborating on their \"information\" last week that some protestors intended to provoke disorders.<br />\nMeanwhile, paratroopers began landing this week in<br />\nWashington to be ready for possible disorders over the<br />\nweekend. About 2,000 paratroopers are stationed in the<br />\ncapital area to supplement the 9,000 District of Columbia,<br />\nNational Guardsmen assigned for the Moratorium demonstrations.
