The<br />\njob of teaching the young<br />\nidea to shoot is not one to be undertaken lightly; and<br />\nin consequence, we had hoped to forego it this year.<br />\nSuch constraint does not deprive us, however, of the<br />\npleasure of extending a cordial welcome to the new<br />\nfreshman class and of wishing it, to coin a phrase, a<br />\nmost successful and enjoyable stay at the University.<br />\nBut we cannot let the occasion pass without lapsing<br />\nfrom our high resolve to indulge in no Pecksniffian<br />\nhokum about the freshman's hopes and fears. The desire to warn and admonish cannot be kept down.<br />\nOne of the staff, more wise in the ways of fraternities and campus politicians than the rest of us, thinks<br />\nwe should advise the freshmen to walk softly and carry<br />\na big stick. That was so uncomfortably close to Mr.<br />\n<br />\nPrelude to<br />\nAcademic<br />\nLiFe<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAI<br />\nti<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\ndj<br />\natt<br />\nj<br />\na-ltr\u2022<br />\n4:tij<br />\nar'\"Wiriti<br />\n<br />\nfavor of something more concerned with the brotherhood of man.<br />\nThese are troubled times. There is no academic<br />\ncloister which can fully protect us from the evils of this<br />\nworld. Never before has man been so buffeted by the<br />\nwinds of doctrine; never before has he been so in need<br />\nof the cardinal virtues of tolvance and good humor.<br />\nIf our society is to again go forward, it needs most of all<br />\ncitizens who are ready to face fearlessly the fact of<br />\nchange and to judge each new nostrum without fear or<br />\nfavor.<br />\nYour freshman, and every one else it seems to us,<br />\nshould paste in his hat, before all other bits of advice,<br />\nthe late Justice Holmes' definition of the old-fashioned<br />\nliberal.<br />\nA Holmes liberal, you may remember, is one who<br />\nsimply cannot believe himself to be God.<br />\n<br />\nIt seems that these are revolutionary times. Elsewhere<br />\nin this issue can be found a<br />\nfull account of the recent<br />\nchanges which have been instituted in the conduct of<br />\nUniversity life, changes so<br />\nprofound that their import can hardly be realized<br />\nat this time. Most of the changes seem long overdue,<br />\nbut their final effect must abide the question.<br />\nSo far as the new dance program is concerned, there<br />\nseems to be little purpose in looking back. The sins<br />\nof the Cotillion Board should be forgotten as soon as<br />\npossible. The main business at hand is the future of the<br />\nde-emphasis plan. It can only succeed with the spirited<br />\ncooperation of the student body. Without such support,<br />\nwe can anticipate only a return to the old order. And<br />\nwe submit, there is no place on a progressive campus<br />\nfor an organization like the Cotillion Board.<br />\nWe are frankly disappointed with the passing of the<br />\nBlue Jay. It is hard to keep down a certain regret for<br />\nwhat might have been. The Jay in its old, half-caste<br />\nstate may have been a pretty feeble affair. But, on potentialities alone, it deservd a better fate.<br />\nThere are certain aspects of the purge which may<br />\nseem a bit unfortunate. For example, it is another<br />\nexample of the ancient Council custom of presenting its<br />\ndecisions to the campus as faits accomplis. Under the<br />\ncircumstances, no other method offered itself. But<br />\nthe Council should proceed as quickly as possible to<br />\neradicate any traces of discontent by giving the widest<br />\nadvance publicity to its future.<br />\nMost of the current talk about Council dictatorship<br />\nhas come from persons who have been hardly conspicious for faith in democracy in the past. But the<br />\n<br />\nThe Omnibus<br />\nOf A<br />\nPurge<br />\n<br />\nmere character of the victims of a Big Stick policy<br />\ndoes not fully justify it. The fact that the Student<br />\nCouncil is an elected body cannot alone guarantee its<br />\ndemocratic management. For, any real democracy demands the frank and open discussion of policy.<br />\nIn the long run, we suspect that the best Council is<br />\nthe strongest Council. So long as its scope was limited,<br />\nelection of members was determined by factors not<br />\ngenerally associated with efficient government. With<br />\nits new powers, the Council has now become a center<br />\nof discussion.

As a Junior publication it is<br />\nfelt that the responsibility can be<br />\nbetter shouldered with a finer product as a direct result.<br />\nThe Student council has looked unfavorably on the Cotillion board for<br />\nsome time. The situation reached a<br />\ncrisis this past year. It was the decision of the Council with the full<br />\nconsent of the<br />\n<br />\nStudent Activities<br />\nAdministration<br />\n<br />\ncommittee and the<br />\n<br />\nto completely abolish the Cotillion<br />\nboard. It should be remembered \u2022that<br />\nthis action was taken at a time when<br />\nonly two members of the Board were<br />\neligible for membership. The Council<br />\nwas of the opinion that the Cotillion<br />\nboard had definitely lowered its<br />\nstandards\u2014the Board was entirely<br />\nunrepresentative,<br />\n<br />\noperating<br />\n<br />\nas<br />\n<br />\na<br />\n<br />\nclosed political and fraternity affair<br />\nthat catered only to a select group<br />\nfor its personnel. The price of dances<br />\noffered was too high to be in the<br />\nprice range of entertainment for a<br />\nmajor portion of the student body. In<br />\neffect, it was felt that the Cotillion<br />\nboard had become a selective privateer of undemocratic nature, having no place on the Hopkins campus.<br />\nIn its place the Student Activities<br />\nCommittee has drawn up a Dance<br />\nCommission composed of the presidents of the four classes to be elected<br />\nand three students at large, one each<br />\nrepresentative of the School of Engineering, the School of Business Economics, and the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences. These three men are to be<br />\nappointed with the same proceedure<br />\ngoverning the appointment of members of the Student Activities Committee.<br />\nFor the present scholastic year the<br />\nSAC has<br />\n<br />\nappointed<br />\n<br />\nDonald<br />\n<br />\nKirk-<br />\n<br />\nwood (Chairman), Edward Carl, and<br />\nArthur Maass. The Commission will<br />\nfurther organize and formulate its<br />\nconstitution after the termination of<br />\ntne coming class elections. The Commission will be supervised by the<br />\nSAC.<br />\nIt is to be the prescribed policy<br />\nthat dances are to be held as closed<br />\naffairs to the student body of Hop,_ns. The WA, WM be chosen so<br />\nthat the price of admission will be<br />\nreasonable. As a result the dances<br />\nwill be true Hopkins dances catering<br />\nto the entire student body rather than<br />\na profit making organization of undemocratic nature as has been past<br />\npolicy.<br />\nThe above action has been promulgated entirely by the Student Council and the Student Activities Committee. Exercising primary jurisdiction the Council passed the above<br />\nmeasures by a unanimous vote. These<br />\nmeasures will immediately become<br />\neffective.<br />\nThe Student Council also wishes<br />\nto announce that the publication of<br />\nthe Blue Jay will be discontinued.<br />\nThis publication has been a private<br />\nenterprise of a profit-making nature,<br />\nentirely outside of the jurisdiction of<br />\nthe Student Council and the Student<br />\nActivities Comittee. The action taken<br />\nin closing this publication has been<br />\nentirely in the hands of the Administration of the University and the decision was handed down by the same.<br />\nIn an entirely unofficial capacity the<br />\nStudent Council and the Student<br />\nActivities Committee agree unanimously with the action of the administration in ridding the campus of the<br />\nBlue Jay publication.<br />\nThe Student Council and the Stulent Activities committee hope they<br />\nwill receive the cooperation of all<br />\nactivities during the coming year. It<br />\nwas felt that a shake-up was much<br />\nneeded and overdue. We realize that<br />\ncertain groups will be in disagreement with the action taken, but it is<br />\nto be remembered that these groups<br />\nare small and entirely unrepresentative of the Hopkins student body;<br />\nthe majority is in enthusiastic agreement.<br />\nThe changes involved serve to open<br />\nactivities to more men, put them on<br />\na non-profit basis, and therby increase the possibilities of more democratic participation in these activities.

The<br />\njob of teaching the young<br />\nidea to shoot is not one to be undertaken lightly; and<br />\nin consequence, we had hoped to forego it this year.<br />\nSuch constraint does not deprive us, however, of the<br />\npleasure of extending a cordial welcome to the new<br />\nfreshman class and of wishing it, to coin a phrase, a<br />\nmost successful and enjoyable stay at the University.<br />\nBut we cannot let the occasion pass without lapsing<br />\nfrom our high resolve to indulge in no Pecksniffian<br />\nhokum about the freshman's hopes and fears. The desire to warn and admonish cannot be kept down.<br />\nOne of the staff, more wise in the ways of fraternities and campus politicians than the rest of us, thinks<br />\nwe should advise the freshmen to walk softly and carry<br />\na big stick.

Most of the changes seem long overdue,<br />\nbut their final effect must abide the question.<br />\nSo far as the new dance program is concerned, there<br />\nseems to be little purpose in looking back. The sins<br />\nof the Cotillion Board should be forgotten as soon as<br />\npossible. The main business at hand is the future of the<br />\nde-emphasis plan.

For example, it is another<br />\nexample of the ancient Council custom of presenting its<br />\ndecisions to the campus as faits accomplis. Under the<br />\ncircumstances, no other method offered itself. But<br />\nthe Council should proceed as quickly as possible to<br />\neradicate any traces of discontent by giving the widest<br />\nadvance publicity to its future.<br />\nMost of the current talk about Council dictatorship<br />\nhas come from persons who have been hardly conspicious for faith in democracy in the past. But the<br /><br />\nThe Omnibus<br />\nOf A<br />\nPurge<br /><br />\nmere character of the victims of a Big Stick policy<br />\ndoes not fully justify it. The fact that the Student<br />\nCouncil is an elected body cannot alone guarantee its<br />\ndemocratic management. For, any real democracy demands the frank and open discussion of policy.<br />\nIn the long run, we suspect that the best Council is<br />\nthe strongest Council. So long as its scope was limited,<br />\nelection of members was determined by factors not<br />\ngenerally associated with efficient government. With<br />\nits new powers, the Council has now become a center<br />\nof discussion. The result may well be a new sense of<br />\nresponsibility on the part of its members, and what is<br />\nmore important, a new interest in their election on the<br />\npart of the campus.<br />\nThe best government is not always the least government. It is rather that government which combines<br />\na firm vision of the best interests ,of those it serves with<br />\na constant sensitiveness to their wishes.

The Council<br />\nwas of the opinion that the Cotillion<br />\nboard had definitely lowered its<br />\nstandards\u2014the Board was entirely<br />\nunrepresentative,<br /><br />\noperating<br /><br />\nas<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nclosed political and fraternity affair<br />\nthat catered only to a select group<br />\nfor its personnel. The price of dances<br />\noffered was too high to be in the<br />\nprice range of entertainment for a<br />\nmajor portion of the student body. In<br />\neffect, it was felt that the Cotillion<br />\nboard had become a selective privateer of undemocratic nature, having no place on the Hopkins campus.<br />\nIn its place the Student Activities<br />\nCommittee has drawn up a Dance<br />\nCommission composed of the presidents of the four classes to be elected<br />\nand three students at large, one each<br />\nrepresentative of the School of Engineering, the School of Business Economics, and the College of Arts and<br />\nSciences. These three men are to be<br />\nappointed with the same proceedure<br />\ngoverning the appointment of members of the Student Activities Committee.<br />\nFor the present scholastic year the<br />\nSAC has<br /><br />\nappointed<br /><br />\nDonald<br /><br />\nKirk-<br /><br />\nwood (Chairman), Edward Carl, and<br />\nArthur Maass. The Commission will<br />\nfurther organize and formulate its<br />\nconstitution after the termination of<br />\ntne coming class elections. The Commission will be supervised by the<br />\nSAC.<br />\nIt is to be the prescribed policy<br />\nthat dances are to be held as closed<br />\naffairs to the student body of Hop,_ns. The WA, WM be chosen so<br />\nthat the price of admission will be<br />\nreasonable. As a result the dances<br />\nwill be true Hopkins dances catering<br />\nto the entire student body rather than<br />\na profit making organization of undemocratic nature as has been past<br />\npolicy.<br />\nThe above action has been promulgated entirely by the Student Council and the Student Activities Committee. Exercising primary jurisdiction the Council passed the above<br />\nmeasures by a unanimous vote. These<br />\nmeasures will immediately become<br />\neffective.<br />\nThe Student Council also wishes<br />\nto announce that the publication of<br />\nthe Blue Jay will be discontinued.<br />\nThis publication has been a private<br />\nenterprise of a profit-making nature,<br />\nentirely outside of the jurisdiction of<br />\nthe Student Council and the Student<br />\nActivities Comittee. The action taken<br />\nin closing this publication has been<br />\nentirely in the hands of the Administration of the University and the decision was handed down by the same.<br />\nIn an entirely unofficial capacity the<br />\nStudent Council and the Student<br />\nActivities Committee agree unanimously with the action of the administration in ridding the campus of the<br />\nBlue Jay publication.<br />\nThe Student Council and the Stulent Activities committee hope they<br />\nwill receive the cooperation of all<br />\nactivities during the coming year. It<br />\nwas felt that a shake-up was much<br />\nneeded and overdue. We realize that<br />\ncertain groups will be in disagreement with the action taken, but it is<br />\nto be remembered that these groups<br />\nare small and entirely unrepresentative of the Hopkins student body;<br />\nthe majority is in enthusiastic agreement.<br />\nThe changes involved serve to open<br />\nactivities to more men, put them on<br />\na non-profit basis, and therby increase the possibilities of more democratic participation in these activities.
