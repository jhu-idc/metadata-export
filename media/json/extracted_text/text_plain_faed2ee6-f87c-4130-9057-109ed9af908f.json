A number of mission-study<br />\nclasses have been formed under<br />\nthe direction of the Young Men's<br />\nChristian Association, and it was<br />\nfor the purpose of getting men sufficiently interested to become members of these mission-study groups<br />\nthat the mass-meeting was held.<br />\nThe program, although quite extensive, was most pleasing throughout Short talks of about five minutes each were first given by Mr.<br />\nA. K. Barton, '14; Mr. Walter D.<br />\nSutton, '14; Mr. Guy T. 0. Hollyday, '14; and Mr. Myron E. Bagley, '16.<br />\nMr. Barton, as chairman, presented the purpose of the meeting;<br />\nMr. Sutton spoke on \"The Value<br />\nof Prayer\"; Mr. Hollyday had for<br />\nhis topic \"The Missionary Offering from Johns Hopkins,\" and<br />\ntold of the plan to raise one hundred dollars for missionary work;<br />\nMr. Bagley discussed the advantages of attending the Eaglesmere<br />\nsummer conference.<br />\nOther speakers were: Rev. William Levering DeVries, A. B. '88,<br />\nPh. D. '92; Dr. Shosuke Sato, of<br />\nJapan; Dr. Heckleman, who is accompanying Dr. Sato on his lecture tour; and Dr. Frame, who has<br />\nspent the last eight years in Persia.<br />\nRev. W. L. DeVries had for his<br />\ntopic \"The Call to Service in the<br />\nMission Field.\" He presented a<br />\nstrong appeal, showing the need of<br />\nworkers in the foreign field. Dr.<br />\nFrame spoke of the opportunity for<br />\nmission work in Persia. Dr. Sato<br />\nand Dr. Heckleman both presented<br />\nthe question of Christianizing Japan.<br />\nThey emphasized the fact that what<br />\nis needed in Japan are missionaries<br />\nwho can make an impression on the<br />\ninner life of the Japanese people,<br />\nso that the Japanese may get their<br />\ninspirations from God. Dr. Sato<br />\nmade an especially strong appeal<br />\nwhen he said, in closing: \"Gentlemen, will you all please pray that<br />\nJapan will become a Christian nation.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe seniors opened up the 1914<br />\nbanquet season on last Monday<br />\nnight at the Emerson. Thirty-two<br />\nof the upper classmen were present,<br />\nseated about a monster round-table.<br />\nEveryone declared that the menu<br />\nwas the best ever given at a class<br />\nbanquet. Certain members of the<br />\nclass maintain that they ate nineteen different varieties of food, not<br />\nto say anything about the quantity<br />\nof each. Certain other members<br />\nwent home Monday night with a<br />\npeculiar feeling around the equator,<br />\nand refused all invitations on Tuesday to breakfast and lunch. The<br />\n\"bill of lading\" included eight<br />\ncourses, and very few men flunked<br />\nmore than one course. While the<br />\nbanqueters were busy practicalicising the theory of consumption, a<br />\ncapable pianist was hard at work<br />\ntickling the ivories and putting<br />\neveryone in good spirits by the<br />\nclever and able manipulation of his<br />\nfingers.<br />\nBy about 9.30 o'clock, most of<br />\nthe consumers had decided that they<br />\nwere quite near the limits of equilibrium, and Toastmaster C. A.<br />\nWells was propped up, so as to be<br />\nable to direct the mass of logic(?)<br />\nthat was to follow. After the usual<br />\nopening chatter of the toastmaster,<br />\nPresident Sutton spoke with his unusual dry humor on the \"Concomitant Variations of the Class<br />\nThrough the Courses of Chaucer,<br />\nPhysics, Logic and Psychology.\"<br />\n\"Long Ray\" Leibensperger next extolled the ineffable, insuperable excelencies of our athletes in the<br />\nSenior Class. Bacon's \"Novum<br />\nOrganon\" was next laid aside (on<br />\nthe theory that \"ham\" is more substantial that bacon) and A. L. Hammond was introduced to speak on<br />\nthe \"Novissimum Organon\" \u2014 the<br />\n1914 Hullabaloo. Kemper Simpson<br />\nnext delivered the speech of the<br />\nevening. We are unable to describe in these columns what his<br />\n\"dream\" was about, but he may<br />\nconsent to inform you if a selfaddressed, stamped envelope is<br />\nsent him. \"Post hoc ergo propter<br />\nhoc,\" was Rev. S. D. White's text<br />\nfor a sermon on the future of the<br />\nSenior Class.<br />\nFollowing these toasts, there were<br />\na number of speakers, all of whom<br />\ndelivered good speeches and then<br />\nmarred them by telling a most excrutiating joke (?) or two.

The exercises, which usually take place on Washington's<br />\nBirthday, will be held on Monday,<br />\nFebruary 23, owning to the fact<br />\nthat the regular date falls on Sunday.<br />\nMr. Montague is one of the most<br />\ndistinguished men in Virginia today, and also one of her best-known<br />\nscholars. Graduating from Richmond College in 1882, with the degree of A. B., he pursued the law<br />\ncourse at the University of Virginia, receiving his LL. B. there in<br />\n1885. Four years later he married<br />\nMiss Elizabeth Lyne Hoskins, of<br />\nCarltons, Va.<br />\nThe first office of state which Mr.<br />\nMontague held was that of United<br />\nStates District Attorney for tile<br />\nWestern District of Virginia (189498). At the close of his term he<br />\nbecame Attorney-General of Virginia, from which position he Was<br />\nelected governor of the State in<br />\n1902. His record while in the executive chair was brilliant and, under his guidance, many laws of lasting good to the State were passed.<br />\nRichmond College offered Mr.<br />\nMontague the deanship of its law<br />\nschool in 1906, and he accepted<br />\nwhen his four-year term as chief<br />\nexecutive had expired. However,<br />\nthe confinement of the academic<br />\nworld was too binding upon a man<br />\nof his great vitality, and he resigned<br />\nafter three years to resume his law<br />\npractice in Richmond. After his<br />\nreturn to private life, Mr. Montague<br />\nwas successively appointed to represent the United States in Rio de<br />\nJaniero at the Pan-American Conference, and as a delegate to the<br />\nThird International Conference on<br />\nMaritime Law, held at Brussels<br />\n(1909-10). Recently he was elected to Congress, and is serving there<br />\nwith honor to himself and to his<br />\nState.<br />\nBesides the high attainments of<br />\nMr. Montague in the political<br />\nworld, he has made an enviable<br />\nreputation as a lawyer and a<br />\nscholar. The Phi Beta Kappa key<br />\nwas conferred upon him at William<br />\nand Mary College in 19o8. He has<br />\nreceived honorary degrees at Brown<br />\nand Harvard, at both of which universities he has spoken on important occasions. He is a trustee of<br />\nthe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which has recently<br />\n<br />\nThe annual McCoy Hall concert by the Musical Clubs was given<br />\nlast Friday night, February 6. The<br />\nClubs were in fine form and gave<br />\ndecidedly the best performance of<br />\nthis season. In the number of performers, all former records were<br />\nexceeded, since nearly every member of the unusually large Clubs<br />\nwas able to take part in this home<br />\nconcert. The results of this fact<br />\nwere quite noticeable in the deep<br />\nvolume of the Glee Club's selections, and the Instrumental Club<br />\nwas also decidedly improved by the<br />\naddition of a 'cello and a bass-viol.<br />\nAside from the fact that the program was a little longer than<br />\npleased some of the more impatient<br />\ndancers, the whole affair may be<br />\nsaid to have gone off without a<br />\nhitch. The audience, considering<br />\nthe unpleasant weather, was quite<br />\nlarge; and, judging from the applause and from the number who<br />\nstayed for the dance which immediately followed the concert, they appreciated the efforts of the entertainers.<br />\nIn the first number\u2014the University Ode\u2014both Clubs took part, a<br />\ncombination which had never been<br />\ntried before, but which proved<br />\nquite effective. The Glee Club was<br />\nmost appreciated in their song,<br />\n\"Mighty Lak' a Rose,\" in which<br />\nMr. Scovell sang a solo part, while<br />\nthe rest of the Club hummed the accompaniment. The instrumentalists,<br />\nwith their popular \"rags,\" received<br />\nhearty applause after every number. Geissel's violin solo and Gminder's performance on the 'cello were<br />\nboth very well received, and later,<br />\nwhen the two played together, the<br />\ncombination was most pleasing.<br />\nJacobs also starred, as he always<br />\ndoes, in his ,performance on the<br />\nmandolin. The quartet and octet<br />\nwere likewise encored several times.<br />\nThe following night a picked<br />\ndelegation from the two Clubs,<br />\nabout twenty-five in number, gave<br />\na concert at Hood (Woman's) College, Frederick, Md., where their<br />\nperformance was very well received,<br />\nand a dance given in their honor<br />\nafterward by the juniors and freshmen of the institution.

Benson, art director of the<br />\nStratford-upon-Avon Players, delighted an audience of students on<br />\nThursday afternoon in the Donovan<br />\nRoom. His subject, \"Song Words.<br />\nof a Nation,\" gave Mr. Benson a<br />\nwide field, which he covered as an<br />\nartist and a poet, rather than a<br />\ncritic.<br />\nWhile the lecturer's specialty is<br />\nShakespeare, and his talk led up to<br />\nthe immortal bard, he carried his<br />\nhearers back to the rudiments of<br />\npoetry, its elements and its significance. The roar of the lion, the<br />\ntwitter of birds\u2014all the animal and<br />\nprimitive sounds\u2014were traced forward to their expression in Shakespeare. Instances of the different effects of rhythm were were given by<br />\nMr. Benson, who, with great dramatic power, rendered Othello's<br />\nfamous speech and the latter part<br />\nof Anthony's oration over Caesar's<br />\nbody.<br />\nA more interesting lecturer would<br />\nbe hard to find. In his words and<br />\nin his personality, Mr. Benson personifies not only the 'scholarly man,<br />\nbut the man of wide culture and<br />\npoetical instinct, displaying histrionic ability of a high order.<br />\n<br />\nInteresting Lecture by French Scholar.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Hurgronje to Lecture.<br />\n<br />\nN.E.Cor.

To meet the<br />\never-increasing calls for supplies;<br />\nfor recruits, for prayers, the interest of the home base has to be<br />\nkindled by more efficient means<br />\nthan occasional, spasmodic missionary meetings.

Bagley, '16.<br />\nMr. Barton, as chairman, presented the purpose of the meeting;<br />\nMr. Sutton spoke on \"The Value<br />\nof Prayer\"; Mr. Hollyday had for<br />\nhis topic \"The Missionary Offering from Johns Hopkins,\" and<br />\ntold of the plan to raise one hundred dollars for missionary work;<br />\nMr. Bagley discussed the advantages of attending the Eaglesmere<br />\nsummer conference.<br />\nOther speakers were: Rev. William Levering DeVries, A. B. '88,<br />\nPh. D. '92; Dr. Shosuke Sato, of<br />\nJapan; Dr. Heckleman, who is accompanying Dr. Sato on his lecture tour; and Dr. Frame, who has<br />\nspent the last eight years in Persia.<br />\nRev. W. L. DeVries had for his<br />\ntopic \"The Call to Service in the<br />\nMission Field.\" He presented a<br />\nstrong appeal, showing the need of<br />\nworkers in the foreign field. Dr.<br />\nFrame spoke of the opportunity for<br />\nmission work in Persia. Dr. Sato<br />\nand Dr. Heckleman both presented<br />\nthe question of Christianizing Japan.<br />\nThey emphasized the fact that what<br />\nis needed in Japan are missionaries<br />\nwho can make an impression on the<br />\ninner life of the Japanese people,<br />\nso that the Japanese may get their<br />\ninspirations from God. Dr. Sato<br />\nmade an especially strong appeal<br />\nwhen he said, in closing: \"Gentlemen, will you all please pray that<br />\nJapan will become a Christian nation.\"<br /><br />\nThe seniors opened up the 1914<br />\nbanquet season on last Monday<br />\nnight at the Emerson. Thirty-two<br />\nof the upper classmen were present,<br />\nseated about a monster round-table.<br />\nEveryone declared that the menu<br />\nwas the best ever given at a class<br />\nbanquet. Certain members of the<br />\nclass maintain that they ate nineteen different varieties of food, not<br />\nto say anything about the quantity<br />\nof each. Certain other members<br />\nwent home Monday night with a<br />\npeculiar feeling around the equator,<br />\nand refused all invitations on Tuesday to breakfast and lunch. The<br />\n\"bill of lading\" included eight<br />\ncourses, and very few men flunked<br />\nmore than one course. While the<br />\nbanqueters were busy practicalicising the theory of consumption, a<br />\ncapable pianist was hard at work<br />\ntickling the ivories and putting<br />\neveryone in good spirits by the<br />\nclever and able manipulation of his<br />\nfingers.<br />\nBy about 9.30 o'clock, most of<br />\nthe consumers had decided that they<br />\nwere quite near the limits of equilibrium, and Toastmaster C. A.<br />\nWells was propped up, so as to be<br />\nable to direct the mass of logic(?)<br />\nthat was to follow. After the usual<br />\nopening chatter of the toastmaster,<br />\nPresident Sutton spoke with his unusual dry humor on the \"Concomitant Variations of the Class<br />\nThrough the Courses of Chaucer,<br />\nPhysics, Logic and Psychology.\"<br />\n\"Long Ray\" Leibensperger next extolled the ineffable, insuperable excelencies of our athletes in the<br />\nSenior Class. Bacon's \"Novum<br />\nOrganon\" was next laid aside (on<br />\nthe theory that \"ham\" is more substantial that bacon) and A. L. Hammond was introduced to speak on<br />\nthe \"Novissimum Organon\" \u2014 the<br />\n1914 Hullabaloo. Kemper Simpson<br />\nnext delivered the speech of the<br />\nevening. We are unable to describe in these columns what his<br />\n\"dream\" was about, but he may<br />\nconsent to inform you if a selfaddressed, stamped envelope is<br />\nsent him. \"Post hoc ergo propter<br />\nhoc,\" was Rev. S. D. White's text<br />\nfor a sermon on the future of the<br />\nSenior Class.<br />\nFollowing these toasts, there were<br />\na number of speakers, all of whom<br />\ndelivered good speeches and then<br />\nmarred them by telling a most excrutiating joke (?) or two.

The exercises, which usually take place on Washington's<br />\nBirthday, will be held on Monday,<br />\nFebruary 23, owning to the fact<br />\nthat the regular date falls on Sunday.<br />\nMr. Montague is one of the most<br />\ndistinguished men in Virginia today, and also one of her best-known<br />\nscholars. Graduating from Richmond College in 1882, with the degree of A. B., he pursued the law<br />\ncourse at the University of Virginia, receiving his LL. B. there in<br />\n1885. Four years later he married<br />\nMiss Elizabeth Lyne Hoskins, of<br />\nCarltons, Va.<br />\nThe first office of state which Mr.<br />\nMontague held was that of United<br />\nStates District Attorney for tile<br />\nWestern District of Virginia (189498). At the close of his term he<br />\nbecame Attorney-General of Virginia, from which position he Was<br />\nelected governor of the State in<br />\n1902. His record while in the executive chair was brilliant and, under his guidance, many laws of lasting good to the State were passed.<br />\nRichmond College offered Mr.<br />\nMontague the deanship of its law<br />\nschool in 1906, and he accepted<br />\nwhen his four-year term as chief<br />\nexecutive had expired. However,<br />\nthe confinement of the academic<br />\nworld was too binding upon a man<br />\nof his great vitality, and he resigned<br />\nafter three years to resume his law<br />\npractice in Richmond. After his<br />\nreturn to private life, Mr. Montague<br />\nwas successively appointed to represent the United States in Rio de<br />\nJaniero at the Pan-American Conference, and as a delegate to the<br />\nThird International Conference on<br />\nMaritime Law, held at Brussels<br />\n(1909-10). Recently he was elected to Congress, and is serving there<br />\nwith honor to himself and to his<br />\nState.<br />\nBesides the high attainments of<br />\nMr. Montague in the political<br />\nworld, he has made an enviable<br />\nreputation as a lawyer and a<br />\nscholar. The Phi Beta Kappa key<br />\nwas conferred upon him at William<br />\nand Mary College in 19o8. He has<br />\nreceived honorary degrees at Brown<br />\nand Harvard, at both of which universities he has spoken on important occasions. He is a trustee of<br />\nthe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which has recently<br /><br />\nThe annual McCoy Hall concert by the Musical Clubs was given<br />\nlast Friday night, February 6. The<br />\nClubs were in fine form and gave<br />\ndecidedly the best performance of<br />\nthis season. In the number of performers, all former records were<br />\nexceeded, since nearly every member of the unusually large Clubs<br />\nwas able to take part in this home<br />\nconcert. The results of this fact<br />\nwere quite noticeable in the deep<br />\nvolume of the Glee Club's selections, and the Instrumental Club<br />\nwas also decidedly improved by the<br />\naddition of a 'cello and a bass-viol.<br />\nAside from the fact that the program was a little longer than<br />\npleased some of the more impatient<br />\ndancers, the whole affair may be<br />\nsaid to have gone off without a<br />\nhitch. The audience, considering<br />\nthe unpleasant weather, was quite<br />\nlarge; and, judging from the applause and from the number who<br />\nstayed for the dance which immediately followed the concert, they appreciated the efforts of the entertainers.<br />\nIn the first number\u2014the University Ode\u2014both Clubs took part, a<br />\ncombination which had never been<br />\ntried before, but which proved<br />\nquite effective. The Glee Club was<br />\nmost appreciated in their song,<br />\n\"Mighty Lak' a Rose,\" in which<br />\nMr. Scovell sang a solo part, while<br />\nthe rest of the Club hummed the accompaniment. The instrumentalists,<br />\nwith their popular \"rags,\" received<br />\nhearty applause after every number. Geissel's violin solo and Gminder's performance on the 'cello were<br />\nboth very well received, and later,<br />\nwhen the two played together, the<br />\ncombination was most pleasing.<br />\nJacobs also starred, as he always<br />\ndoes, in his ,performance on the<br />\nmandolin. The quartet and octet<br />\nwere likewise encored several times.<br />\nThe following night a picked<br />\ndelegation from the two Clubs,<br />\nabout twenty-five in number, gave<br />\na concert at Hood (Woman's) College, Frederick, Md., where their<br />\nperformance was very well received,<br />\nand a dance given in their honor<br />\nafterward by the juniors and freshmen of the institution.

Benson, art director of the<br />\nStratford-upon-Avon Players, delighted an audience of students on<br />\nThursday afternoon in the Donovan<br />\nRoom. His subject, \"Song Words.<br />\nof a Nation,\" gave Mr. Benson a<br />\nwide field, which he covered as an<br />\nartist and a poet, rather than a<br />\ncritic.<br />\nWhile the lecturer's specialty is<br />\nShakespeare, and his talk led up to<br />\nthe immortal bard, he carried his<br />\nhearers back to the rudiments of<br />\npoetry, its elements and its significance. The roar of the lion, the<br />\ntwitter of birds\u2014all the animal and<br />\nprimitive sounds\u2014were traced forward to their expression in Shakespeare. Instances of the different effects of rhythm were were given by<br />\nMr. Benson, who, with great dramatic power, rendered Othello's<br />\nfamous speech and the latter part<br />\nof Anthony's oration over Caesar's<br />\nbody.<br />\nA more interesting lecturer would<br />\nbe hard to find. In his words and<br />\nin his personality, Mr. Benson personifies not only the 'scholarly man,<br />\nbut the man of wide culture and<br />\npoetical instinct, displaying histrionic ability of a high order.<br /><br />\nInteresting Lecture by French Scholar.<br /><br />\nDr. Hurgronje to Lecture.<br /><br />\nN.E.Cor.

Woodward, '16,<br />\nis managing editor for this issue.<br />\nThe Christian Student's Duty.<br /><br />\nNo less man than the Duke of<br />\nWellington said that the last command of Christ, \"Go ye into all the<br />\nworld and preach the Gospel to<br />\nevery creature,\" constituted for<br />\nChristian men their \"marching orders.\"<br />\nDuring the Spanish War, this<br />\nUniversity was aflame with military<br />\nspirit. Companies were organized<br />\nand drills held regularly in the cage.<br />\nPeople paid the additional taxes<br />\nwithout a murmur. Newspapers<br />\ncontaining accounts from the front<br />\nwere read with remarkable avidity.<br />\nNothing could daunt the patriot's<br />\nzeal.<br />\nFor nearly two thousand years<br />\nhave been waged, with greater or<br />\nless enthusiasm, the Holy War of<br />\nChrist. Today, more than ever before, those on the \"firing line\" are<br />\nbegging for supplies, recruits and<br />\nprayers.<br />\n\"Whom shall we send, and who<br />\nwill go for us,\" is the daily question confronting the mission boards.<br />\nN.sooner is this answered than,<br />\n\"How shall they preach, except they<br />\nbe sent?\" is asked. To meet the<br />\never-increasing calls for supplies;<br />\nfor recruits, for prayers, the interest of the home base has to be<br />\nkindled by more efficient means<br />\nthan occasional, spasmodic missionary meetings. To know the subject<br />\nof electricity, more is required than<br />\nbiennial attendance at the meetings<br />\nof a scientific association. To<br />\nknow the subject of missions, one<br />\nmust make a study of missions.<br />\nMoreover, it is .required of a<br />\nsoldier that a man be found faithful. Faithfulness in this cause,<br /><br />\n\"dear to the heart of the Saviour,\"<br />\nis synonymous with intelligent support. Intelligent support comes<br />\nfrom knowledge of the subject.<br />\nKnowledge comes by.being a member of a mission study group. The<br />\nMission-Study Committee has asked<br />\nthat men give up eight hours out of<br />\nthe 5,040 hours in the college year<br />\nto the study of missions.<br />\nLeaders and courses have been<br />\ncarefully selected. The Missionary<br />\nCommittee asks the individual student's attendance on the courses;<br />\nand, by enlisting other men, to<br />\nmake the missionary propaganda a<br />\nsuccess.<br /><br />\n440<br />\n\"11111111111u<br />\n511111111111111111111V \u2022<br /><br />\nLEMPERT<br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nSMART<br /><br />\n,u<br />\n,<br />\ner<br />\nY.11111111111<br />\nIisHIIIIflhIUHHhlIf<br /><br />\na<br /><br />\nCLOTHES<br /><br />\nYOUTHS AND YOUNG MEN<br />\nREADY TO PUT ON AND MADE 10 MEASURE<br />\n2:<br /><br />\nPLAZA BLDG\u2022<br /><br />\n19 EAST<br />\nFAYETTE ST.<br /><br />\nri<br /><br />\nThe Quest of a Seeker.<br /><br />\nWhat is the administrative plan<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins University?<br />\nWhat is the plan of organization<br />\nof the Board of Trustees, of the<br />\nBoard of Collegiate Studies, of the<br />\nAthetic Board, of the Student Council, and how do these boards affect<br />\nthe undergraduate student?<br />\nThese questions should certainly<br />\nbe matters of familiar knowledge to<br />\nevery undergraduate. As a matter<br />\nof fact, possibly one man in every<br />\ntwenty can answer any two of<br />\nthem; possibly one man in every<br />\nfifty can answer all of them.<br />\nThis state of affairs has given<br />\nrise to a certain feeling of suspicion<br />\nand mistrust, detrimental to a proper spirit among the students. The<br />\nStudent Council took an active part<br />\nin the recent Homewood affair.<br />\nTheir action was resented because<br />\ntheir right to act was not understood. As one man put it, \"They<br />\npop up like a Jack-in-the-box and<br />\nthey disappear without leaving a<br />\ntrail.\" Another complains of the<br />\nfact that undergraduate life is ordered by \"powers that move in darkness.\"<br />\nBeginning next week, THE NtwsLETTER will publish the first of a<br />\nseries of interviews, obtained by \"a<br />\nseeker after information,\" with the<br />\nmen at the head of the various administrative boards.
