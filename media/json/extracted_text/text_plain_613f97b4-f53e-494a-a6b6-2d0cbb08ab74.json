But the<br />\nproudest year in the whole long existence<br />\nof the aristocratic old watering-place was<br />\nthat in which it had the privilege of entertaining at once the captain of a Johns Hopkins lacrosse team and the captain of a Yale<br />\nfootball team. At least that is what all the<br />\nsmall boys thought, and their big sisters<br />\nwere almost unanimously of the same opinion.<br />\nDuring this memorable summer, Betty<br />\nCarleton, of Richmond, was spending a<br />\nmonth at White Sulphur at the cottage of<br />\nher best friend, Jane Thompson. Betty and<br />\nJane had graduated a few weeks before from<br />\nthe Woman's College of Baltimore, and<br />\nthrough the four years of their college life<br />\ntheir friendship had been like that of David<br />\nand Jonathan. Class-mates said this was<br />\nbecause the two girls were so different.<br />\nBetty was admitted to have been the most<br />\nattractive girl in the school, beautiful, witty,<br />\nand inclined to be romantic. Jane was plain,<br />\nmatter-of-fact, and entirely practical. When<br />\nBetty had been chief editor of \"Donnybrook<br />\nFair,\" Jane had been business manager, and<br />\nhad brought Betty's sparkling, but random<br />\neffusions to an orderly and successful publication. Thus it had always been with them,<br />\nBetty began things, Jane finished them;<br />\nBetty was continually rushing into difficulties, Jane continually rescuing her; Betty<br />\nfurnished the firm's stock in trade of beauty<br />\nand genius, Jane was the real managing part-<br />\n<br />\nner; Betty got all the glory, Jane was modestly content with being the acknowledged<br />\nchum of such a prodigy, and with receiving<br />\nin private that prodigy's entire love, trust,<br />\nand unbounded admiration.<br />\nOf course, Betty, like every Woman's College girl, knew the Hopkins captain by sight,<br />\njust as he knew her by reputation. She<br />\nrecognized the lithe figure and the pleasant<br />\nface with its keen gray eyes, the moment she<br />\nsaw their possessor alight from the hotel<br />\n'bus. By a strange coincidence, the Yale<br />\ncaptain made his appearance on the afternoon of the same day. His arrival created<br />\neven more popular stir, if possible, than that<br />\nof the Hopkins man had done. With two.<br />\nsuch celebrities present, the Cabinet official<br />\nwho arrived on the night train, was completely ignored.<br />\nThe coming of the second hero was announced to the girls by an excited little<br />\nbrother of Jane. \"He's awful big,\" the lad<br />\ndeclared, in response to a little surreptitious<br />\nencouragement from Betty; \"four times as<br />\nbig as the Hopkins feller. I heard the<br />\nsprings creak when he got in the 'bus; and<br />\nyou'd better believe the porters moved when<br />\nhe told 'em to N'en he's got curly yellow<br />\nhair, and blue eyes.\" He paused a moment<br />\nfor breath, then plunged his hand into his<br />\npocket and brought forth part of a leaf torn<br />\nfrom one of last fall's sporting journals.<br />\n\"Here's his picture,\" the boy affirmed proudly. \"Harry Jones traded it to me for a dead<br />\nsnake.\" The girls gazed eagerly at the<br />\ndirty scrap of paper\u2014ati least, Betty did;<br />\nJane never showed so active an interest in<br />\nthings masculine. It was a heavy, goodnatured face, and that was all the two girls<br />\ncould glean from the likeness. Beneath,<br />\nhowever, was printed a concise description;<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n\"Weight 214 lbs.; height 6 ft. 2 in.; age 24<br />\nyrs.; has played at guard for Yale for four<br />\nyears, the hardest line-bucker in the country.\"<br />\nBetty handed back the print and looked<br />\nthoughtful. Then she said slowly,\"I believe,<br />\nJane, that after all I shall accept Mrs. Powell's invitation to hear the band at the Grand<br />\nCentral to-night.<br />\n\"There was a mighty hunter, and his prey<br />\nwas man,\" quoted Jane, with a smile.<br />\nBetty looked guilty, and consequently even<br />\nmore ravishing than usual. \"I don't care,\"<br />\nshe said; \"at any rate, this is a new species<br />\nof game. Outside of Tommy Smith, and Joe<br />\nArmstrong, and John Waters, and a dozen<br />\nor so of those foolish Hopkins men, I've had<br />\nno experience at all with athletes.\"<br />\n\"How about that Baltimore Athletic Club<br />\nman?\" queried Jane.<br />\nBetty gurgled. \"The creature wrote a<br />\npoem about me, in which he called me a 'ten<br />\nstrike'; so I had to 'bowl him out' in selfdefense.\"<br />\nThree hours later, two famous athletes<br />\nwere introduced to a. vision in white chiffon<br />\n--a vision with the most wonderful goldenbrown hair, and the biggest, most innocent<br />\nbrown eyes, and the most bewitching smile<br />\nthey had ever seen. At the same time they<br />\nwere introduced to a prim, flaxen-haired<br />\nyoung woman, with honest blue eyes and<br />\ndecided manners; but both were too much<br />\novercome by the vision to pay much attention to her. At the end of the evening the<br />\nsame two athletes were in a very dazed<br />\nstate of mind; and several score of other<br />\nmen whose turns had already come, nudged<br />\neach other and said it was just what they<br />\nhad expected.<br />\nBetty\u2014for the vision was Betty\u2014spent the<br />\nnext morning showing the Yale man about<br />\nthe grounds; that afternoon the Hopkins<br />\nman dropped in for a little chat about mutual friends in Baltimore; in the evening,<br />\nboth men called. This was but the beginning. At the end of a week, during which<br />\nthe double assault never for an instant wavered, Betty confided to Jane that the life was<br />\nalmost too strenuous for her.<br />\n\"If this pace does not soon slacken\u2014observe the result of athletic associations!\u2014I<br />\nshall be a wreck,\" she declared, dimpling.<br />\n\"I have carried on simultaneous perform-<br />\n<br />\nances before, but compared with this they<br />\nwere merely what parlor theatricals are to<br />\na two-ringed circus.\" Jane made no response, and Betty continued, \"Still, athletes<br />\nare such a delightful change. So headstrong,<br />\nand fiery and determined. I wouldn't have<br />\nmissed them for the world.\" Jane's silence<br />\nmust have carried some note of protest with<br />\nit, for here Betty suddenly flung her arms<br />\nabout her, and whispered, \"Ile wouldn't<br />\nmind, you goose!\"<br />\nBetty did not break down after the first<br />\nweek as she had threatened, nor after yet<br />\nanother. In the meantime all Betty's former<br />\nadmirers had beat a temporary retreat leaving a clear field for the athletes,<br />\nSince the chief actors in the little drama<br />\nwere the two best-known men and the most<br />\npopular girl at the Springs, the state of<br />\nthings could not help awakening much interest among the other guests. As the campaign progressed, speculation about the final<br />\nresult grew and grew until it became the<br />\nchief subject of conversation. People would<br />\ndiscuss at breakfast whether they should<br />\nwalk, or read, or watch the Yale-Hopkins<br />\nmatch. Some of the younger men even did<br />\na little betting on the result.<br />\nFor her part, Betty was absolutely impartial in her treatment of her two admirers.<br />\nIf she went to \"Lovers' Leap\" one day with<br />\nCaptain Hopkins, she would even it off by a<br />\ntrip to the Lithia Spring the next day with<br />\nCaptain Yale. If she went riding with one,<br />\nshe would play tennis with the other.<br />\nNeither to the rivals themselves, nor to any<br />\none else, did Betty give any hint as to which<br />\nshe preferred, or even whether either one<br />\nmeant the slightest thing to her. One young<br />\nRichmond man who knew something of Betty<br />\nat home, and who had been to Harvard, was<br />\nemphatic in his views that the last surmise<br />\nwas the correct one.<br />\nAlthough the two men had been equally<br />\nquick in succumbing to Betty's charms, their<br />\nmethods of love-making were radically difThe Hopkins man made his apferent.<br />\nproaches in a steady and systematic manner.<br />\nThe principles were the same he had used<br />\nwith such success upon the lacrosse field\u2014<br />\nno wild long passes, no reckless shots for<br />\ngoal, but a constant endeavor to carry the<br />\nball steadily forward, and then, when the<br />\ntime came, to shoot goal. The Yale aspirant<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwent about his work with a reckless abandon<br />\nthat was truly sublime. Day after day, he<br />\nwould blindly \"buck the line\" in the hope<br />\nof sometime making a touchdown. Before<br />\nthe end of the first week, and daily since<br />\nthen, he had been at the point of blundering<br />\nout the story of his devotion; but each time<br />\nBetty's trained eye perceived the symptoms,<br />\nand the threatened attack was warded off.<br />\nBut all three parties to this triangular<br />\ngame had reckoned without due regard to<br />\none very important factor in the situation.<br />\nThis factor was Jane. Jane waited for a<br />\ngood opportunity to talk with Betty and<br />\nfound it after supper one night. She opened<br />\nthe discussion with a kiss, an ominous sign,<br />\nas Betty knew. Then she announced, \"Betty, this must stop at once! You have no<br />\nright to carry on in any such way, and you<br />\nknow it. Either you find some way out of<br />\nit yourself, or I tell them all about it tonight.\" So far this had been like Jane.<br />\nShe had stated in a nutshell both her opinions and her intentions with regard to the<br />\nmatter. Then she did something very unlike herself. She flung herself on Betty's<br />\nneck and cried. \"Oh, Betty,\" she sobbed,\"I<br />\ndid not think you could be so heartless.<br />\nWhat would Tom think?\" Betty was astonished, or pretended to be. \"Think?\" she<br />\ncried. \"Why, think nothing at all, of course.<br />\nYou know very well I like him a thousand<br />\ntimes better than any one else.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nWhatever the kind or the number of argiunents that Jane used\u2014and the sun had set<br />\nand the twilight nearly gone before the conference ended\u2014the upshot of it all was, that<br />\nwhen the athletic gentlemen arrived shortly<br />\nafter, they were told that Betty would not<br />\nbe able to see them. \"She's had so much<br />\nbother over her sewing lately that she has<br />\nworried herself into a headache,\" Jane explained. \"She has so much to do to get<br />\nready,\" she added mysteriously.<br />\n\"Ah,\" rejoined the mystified pair politely.<br />\n\"It's to come off in the early fall, you<br />\nknow,\" she continued. Each man glared<br />\nsuspiciously at the other.<br />\n\"Surely, Betty has told you about it,<br />\nhasn't she? Well, of course, it has not been<br />\nannounced yet, but it is well understood<br />\namong her friends.\"<br />\n\"You mean,\" ventured the Hopkins man<br />\nat last, \"that Miss Carleton is to be married?\"<br />\n\"Why, yes,\" said Jane innocently, \"to<br />\nJack Cary, with whom she has been brought<br />\nup. They've been sweethearts almost ever<br />\nsince they could talk. It's a very pretty<br />\nstory. I should have thought Betty would<br />\nhave told you. Jack graduated at Harvard<br />\nthe year before last, and is now in England<br />\nattending to some business of his father's<br />\nlaw firm, in which he is soon to become<br />\njunior partner. Oh, surely you do not have<br />\nto leave so soon!\"<br />\n<br />\nWHITE WINGS.<br />\n<br />\nShe lingered for a while beside life's sea,<br />\nGathering strange, lovely thoughts to string like shells<br />\nIn lyric lengths of song,<br />\nNumbering the rythinic beating of the deep,<br />\nWatching the soft, clear day steal from the east,<br />\nOr westward fading, touch the crinkling waves<br />\nWith tender glory; and she saw the boats<br />\nGlide with ribbed sails across the sun, and flit<br />\nWhit'ning through the blue distance, where afar<br />\nThe heavenly country lies all wrapped in mist.<br />\nThere most of all she gazed, and if a gleam<br />\nThreaded the mist, her passionate, grave eyes<br />\nWith more than earthly lustre caught its light;<br />\nThus did she live until her soul took wing<br />\nAnd vanished, like some white bird, in the blue.<br />\n\u2014Elsie Mitchell Rushmore, in the Vassar Miscellany.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE VICTORY OVER BROWN.<br />\n<br />\nNegative<br />\n<br />\nAs the echoes of the oratorical eloquence,<br />\nwhich shook the windows of McCoy Hall on<br />\nthe evening of April 8, have had three weeks<br />\nin which to tickle the ears of our readers,<br />\nit would be superfluous to announce at this<br />\nlate date that Hopkins did Brown up brown<br />\n\u2014besides, that's a poor pun. However, for<br />\nthe sake of those who did not hear the debate itself or whose ears are not ticklish we<br />\nherewith give a brief summary.<br />\nThe question, for which the shirt fronts of<br />\nthe orators creaked, was \"Resolved, That<br />\nthe economic and political interests of the<br />\nUnited States demand the permanent retention of the Philippine Islands.\" We didn't<br />\nresolve that, it was Brown who did, but<br />\nnevertheless, after two hours of wordy dispute, we convinced them, that is Brown, of<br />\ncourse, that we Hopkins, had taken a better<br />\nstand than they, that is, Brown\u2014say, look<br />\nhere, Hopkins won. President hernsen gave<br />\nthe address of welcome and after he had<br />\nconvinced everyone of his sincerity, and the<br />\nGlee Club had been successfully subdued,<br />\nMr. Hurley, first speaker for Brown, was<br />\nintroduced. Resting his right arm\u2014or maybe it was his left\u2014gracefully on Dr. Green's<br />\npulpit, which had been brought down for the<br />\noccasion, Mr. Hurley told us an awful lot.<br />\nThen successively we learned from each<br />\nspeaker of each team, that the other side<br />\nwas woefully ignorant of the question at<br />\nissue.<br />\nThe Hopkins men, either from a<br />\nsense of superior learning, or from the nervousness which Moth\u2014 Dr. Green's pulpit<br />\nnaturally creates, did not rest its several<br />\narms gracefully thereon.<br />\nAt 10.32 P. M., Justice Clabaugh, chairman of the Judges began to tell us who had<br />\nwon, and at 10.39 we learned that Hopkins<br />\nhad done Brown up brown.

Either the<br />\n\"Hullabaloos\" were class books, pure and<br />\nsimple, so that to the Junior, and especially<br />\nto the Freshmen class, they were more or<br />\nless unintelligible, or else (which is still<br />\nworse) they were composed of a lot of unimportant general information which had<br />\nvery little to do with the Senior class.<br />\nRealizing that the \"Hullabaloo\" should be<br />\nprimarily a class book, and yet contain many<br />\n\"hits\" on persons and things familiar to<br />\nJuniors and Freshmen, the editors have kept<br />\nthese two ideas constantly before them, and<br />\nthey believe they have struck a happy medium.<br />\nThe marked character of the book will be<br />\nits originality. Ideas which have been<br />\nworked up in former \"Hullabaloos\" every<br />\ntwo or three years, so that they have become<br />\nalmost legitimate prey, have been discarded.<br />\nMany features of the daily life at the University have been considered, and only those<br />\nhave been chosen which offer the best chance<br />\nfor caricature or \"grinds.\"<br />\nAn entirely new and handsome cover has<br />\nbeen designed which sets the book off very<br />\neffectively.

Of<br />\ncourse, it is hardly necessary to say that the<br />\nshape of the .book will be the same as that<br />\nof former \"Hullabaloos.\"<br />\nIt is in the artistic feature that the book<br />\nwill surpass all those previously turned out.<br />\nNo pains or expense have been spared in obtaining illustrations, which, if proper to the<br />\nspirit of the life at the University, always<br />\n<br />\nhave so much t\u00e1 do with making the book<br />\npopular. The Board has been so fortunate<br />\nas to secure outside as well as Baltimore<br />\ntalent. Among the well-known artists who<br />\nhave contributed are J. Louis Brooks of New<br />\nYork, McKee Barclay and \"Sam\" Theobald<br />\nof this city, and several others. The \"Hullabaloo\" is also fortunate in having two class<br />\nartists who have outdone themselves in making the annual attractive. There will be six<br />\nor seven pages devoted to girls, all of whom<br />\nare said by the Board to be especially attractive. Besides these there will be three<br />\nfull page drawings, something that no other<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" has ever attempted. Their<br />\ntitles will be \"Under the Anheuser-Busch,\"<br />\n\"Two Ways of Enlarging the Heart,\" and<br />\n\"Attending a Post-Graduate Course at the<br />\nSummer School.\"<br />\nAnother feature which has been carefully<br />\nworked up and enlarged is the Athletics.<br />\nThis should be especially interesting this<br />\nyear on account of the revival of interest in<br />\nseveral sports. Each athletic team will be<br />\ngiven a full-page picture. In addition, there<br />\nwill be in the part devoted to Track, the<br />\ndescription of the dual meet with Virginia<br />\nlast May, and a comparison of the records<br />\nat the University with those of a college in<br />\nour class, i. e., one against whom we run in<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania relay races.<br />\nAn especially interesting leading article<br />\non \"College Life\" has been contributed by<br />\nDr. F. H. Sykes, a Hopkins graduate, now<br />\nin Columbia University.<br />\nIn this article only a few of the prominent<br />\nfeatures of the book have been mentioned.<br />\nLittle has been said about the articles themselves, but the Board can assure everyone<br />\nthat \"there are surprises coming,\" and from<br />\nvarious quarters, too.<br />\nThe Board wishes to thank the NEwsLETTER for the chance given to \"exploit\"<br />\nthemselves and their work. They have tried<br />\nmost earnestly to bring out a book which will<br />\ndo credit to their class, and in this spirit they<br />\nhave dedicated it to Naughty-Five.<br />\nIn conclusion, the Board wishes it to be<br />\nknown that they will adjourn to Atlantic<br />\nCity for their health when the \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\nappears.

H. U.<br />\n<br />\nEDITORIAL.<br />\nIn this issue the Board of Editors for<br />\n1905-6 makes its bow to the public. Following the annual custom, the election was held<br />\njust before the Easter vacation, with what<br />\nresults the reader can see for himself by<br />\nglancing above.<br />\nTo speak in terms of praise of what has<br />\nbeen accomplished by the retiring editors<br />\nwould be a work of supererogation. The<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, as it now is, is practically a<br />\nmonument to the ability, the energy and<br />\nthe faithfulness of the editors from the Class<br />\nof 1905. We do not mean to imply that the<br />\npaper has as yet even approximated a state<br />\nof perfection. Neither do we wish to cast<br />\nany reflection upon the management in previous years. Yet the fact remains\u2014a fact<br />\nwhich, we feel sure, is patent to every reader<br />\n\u2014that in the past twelve months theNEwsUTTER has taken a rather remarkable stride<br />\nforward.<br />\nWith respect to the new men upon the<br />\nBoard the paper feels that it is sincerely to<br />\nbe congratulated. Both Mr. Reynolds and<br />\nMr. Bloomfield have given ample proof of<br />\ntheir eminent fitness for the duties of the<br />\npositions to which they have been elected.<br />\nThe choice was made upon the results of an<br />\nopen competition lasting since October, in<br />\nwhich a large number of students took part.<br />\nThe general excellence of the work done by<br />\nthe candidates as a whole was such as to<br />\nleave room for but one regret\u2014that all could<br />\n<br />\nnot be elected. To those whose efforts have<br />\nso far been in vain we offer our earnest<br />\nthanks for their work, and bid them still hope. One position, that of assistant athletic editor, is still open. The number of<br />\ncandidates for this position has been so large<br />\nthat it was thought unfair to make a decision<br />\nuntil the relative ability of those trying for<br />\nthe place could be more accurately gauged.<br />\nThe election will take place within a month,<br />\nhowever, and the competition is still open<br />\nto all.<br />\nAnd now permit the new Board a word<br />\nupon the subject of its policy and intentions.<br />\nWe have said that the NEWS-LETTER is far<br />\nfrom perfect. We recognize this fact very<br />\nkeenly. First of all, we believe the paper<br />\nlacks life and \"ginger.\" Standing, as it<br />\ndoes, in the anomalous position of being at<br />\nonce a newspaper and a literary magazine,<br />\nthe difficulty has always been to co-ordinate<br />\nthese two ends sucessfully. The \"news\" has<br />\nshowed a tendency to read like ancient history, while the original matter has been<br />\nnotable only in its brevity. The new management purposes to obviate this difficulty<br />\nas far as possible by devoting less space to<br />\nthe description of past events; to write all<br />\nsuch happenings as must be taken notice of<br />\nin a style which will make the story interesting even if the matter be \"stale;\" and<br />\nto give more space to original work of a literary character.<br />\nA second fault which we find with the<br />\npaper in its present form is that it does not<br />\nenter fully enough into the life of the University. A college paper should be the vehicle for transmitting the thought of the students. It should mirror public opinion, and<br />\nin some measure mould it. That the NEwsLETTER has never accomplished this purpose<br />\nis largely the fault of the students themselves. Under no circumstances could the<br />\nthought and opinions of a small coterie of<br />\neditors accurately represent the sentiments<br />\nof the nine hundred or more persons connected with the University. To remedy this<br />\nfault we throw our columns open to all. We<br />\ninvite contributions. Open letters, expressions of opinion, proposals of reforms or criticisms of .ex,isting conditions, humorous or<br />\nserious literary matter\u2014in short anything<br />\nwhich may be of interest to the students will<br />\nbe gladly published.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThat is briefly the attitude of the new staff.<br />\nThe editors are aware that it is an ambitious<br />\none. They do not delude themselves with<br />\nthe belief that the reforms they outline so<br />\nglibly will be entirely achieved. With the<br />\nassistance of the student body, however, they<br />\nbelieve a large amount of success is possible,<br />\nand failure to attain it will be due to lack<br />\nof ability, not to lack of spirit.<br />\nConsistency is admittedly a rare and beautiful virtue; but like all virtues it may be<br />\noverdone. Carried to extremes, Consistency<br />\nbecomes Monotony; and of this very simple<br />\npsychological truth the N4ws-LETTER would<br />\nlike, in all delicacy, to remind the baseball<br />\nteam.<br />\nBat Consistency is not the only noble characteristic which our nine has given evidence<br />\nof possessing. After conclusively proving<br />\nto the world in its first game how strong it<br />\nreally was, did it not, with a truly Spartan<br />\nfortitude, deliberately cast fame to the winds<br />\nand firmly refuse to build up a reputation<br />\nat the expense of the sufferings of less powerful brothers? Did it not rather choose to<br />\nsacrifice its own interests to those of these<br />\nmore needy teams, and like a good Samaritan spend its time \"going round about doing<br />\ngood?\" Charity, magnanimity, self-sacrifice, brotherly love, are only a few of the<br />\nlofty virtues of which our baseball team is<br />\nthe living exponent.<br />\nThe N4ws-Lwrm feels like a pig, and no<br />\ngentleman, in finding fault. But it does find<br />\nfault. Sir Philip Sidney is out of place nowa-days\u2014at least on the baseball field. Besides, as we said at the beginning, extremes<br />\nare always obnoxious. Better far the \"golden middle path.\" Let's lose sometimes\u2014<br />\nwhen we have to\u2014but not always. There's<br />\ntruth in Horace's<br />\n\"Salus in mediocritate.\"<br />\nPrompt payment of debts has by many<br />\nleading business men been denominated the<br />\nkey-stone of success. Believe us, then, that<br />\nit is with a firm conviction of the truth of this<br />\nview and with a sincere regard for the future<br />\nwelfare of our readers that the NEwsLETTER ventures to touch upon a somewhat<br />\ndelicate subject.<br />\nOn February 1 the annual bills were sent<br />\nto the readers of the paper. A large propor-<br />\n<br />\ntion were promptly paid, but the number remaining unsettled is still so large as to lead<br />\nus to fear that the ideas of some of our<br />\nfriends upon the \"key-stone of success\" are<br />\nrather vague and shadowy. There are also<br />\na few subscribers who have not yet paid last<br />\nyear's bills. Either the financial condition<br />\nor the business ethics of these persons must<br />\nbe in a .deplorable state.<br />\nIn all seriousness, if you have not yet attended to your bill, let us request that you<br />\nmake it a point to do so at your earliest convenience.<br />\n<br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nPresident Remsen met his class in graduchemistry the other morning, in a lectureroom in which the temperature was uncomfortably chilly.

The chief interest in the<br />\ngame centered around the new players, and<br />\nmany enthusiasts turned out to get a line<br />\non the men and to see how the team would<br />\npull together. It must be said, however,<br />\nthat the crowd of spectators was made up<br />\nof graduates, outsiders, and the same small<br />\nbunch of undergraduates that loyally supports all branches of athletic sport. The<br />\nlack of interest among the undergraduates<br />\nmight be attributed to the bad weather, but<br />\ncertainly it seems to be \"up to\" the studentbody to support the lacrosse team more materially than .they did at the opening game.<br />\nThe coaches, Dr. McInnes and Schmeisser,<br />\ndeserve a great deal of credit for getting the<br />\nnew men into shape. Armstrong, McSherry,<br />\nTough and W. Blanck played a good game,<br />\nconsidering that it was their first collegiate<br />\ncontest. Armstrong, being new, was not at<br />\nhis best in the early stages of the game, but<br />\nimproved in the second half, getting three<br />\nout of the six goals made in this period.<br />\nMcSherry, at third defense, put up a game<br />\nfight and with his weight should make a good<br />\nplayer. Tough showed up the best of the<br />\nnew men, and covered his position in fine<br />\nstyle. W. Blanck had few chances to display his worth owing to the fine defense<br />\ngame played by Schmeisser and Fred<br />\nBlanck, but he managed to keep the ball outside of the goal. Of the old men, Strobhar<br />\n<br />\nand Dill excelled in the attack, while the<br />\nwhole defense played a heady game.<br />\nIn the second half our men were more confident, and much fresher than their opponents, and did not have so much difficulty<br />\nin scoring, making six goals. During this<br />\nhalf McSherry and his opponent, Olpp, put<br />\ntheir heads together and decided that the<br />\ninterest was lagging. The result was that<br />\nMac danced a Highland fling on his shoulders<br />\nfor the benefit of the spectators. Referee<br />\nCole decided that Olpp should retire to the<br />\ntall timbers to cool off, but at the request of<br />\nCaptain Dill the referee permitted him to<br />\nresume his position, and the game proceeded.<br />\nToward the end several substitutions were<br />\nmade to try out new men.<br />\nOur line-up was:<br />\nArmstrong,in-home; Strobhar, out-home; Hudgins,<br />\nfirst attack; Erlanger, second attack; Dill (capt.),<br />\nthird attack; Tough, center; McSherry, H.

How<br />\nhard fought was the game might be seen<br />\nfrom the score-4 to 3; but no one, who was<br />\nnot present, can realize the severity of the<br />\nstruggle and the intense interest of the spectators. The Harvard team was heavy, and<br />\nhad been well drilled in the game by Abner<br />\nSaylor, a \"star\" on the Hopkins team in<br />\n1902. Saylor played first attack for the<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nvisitors, and by far excelled any of his teammates. Smith, another old Hopkinsite, who<br />\nplayea out-home on the Crimson team, came<br />\nnext in excellence.<br />\nThe great disappointment of the game was<br />\nthe slump taken by our attack. All the men,<br />\nwith the exception of Dill and Strobhar,<br />\nshowed a tendency to drop the ball at critical moments, and also failed to follow up<br />\ntheir shots. The defence played a beautiful<br />\ngame and seemed to work well together.<br />\nWalter Blanck at goal made some remarkable stops, and well proved that he is of<br />\n'varsity caliber.<br />\nCaptain Dill made quite a hit with the<br />\n.ladies by his skillful picking up. One young<br />\nlady remarked that \"he was perfectly irresistible.\" W. Blanck had the jump on Harvard's goal-keeper, for whereas the Harvard<br />\nman was protected by well padded football<br />\nclothes, Walter carries his pads wher'er he<br />\ngoes and thus does away with superfluous<br />\nclothes. McRae, Meyer and McSherry took<br />\nturns in spilling Sayler, and managed to<br />\nkeep the Harvard attack busy. The coolest<br />\nmen in the game were Fred Blanck and Bill<br />\nSchmeisser, both of whom played gilt-edged<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe line-up was:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nHarvard.<br />\nW.

Several changes were made in the<br />\nline-up, and in most cases they seem to be<br />\nwise ones. It would seem that the ideal<br />\ncombination has been found, and as a result<br />\nthe men are beginning to show up in real<br />\nchampionship style.<br />\nThe Stevens men were a fine set of fellows,<br />\nbut from the beginning it was seen that they<br />\ncould not play lacrosse. To be serious, the<br />\ngame was nothing more than a good hard<br />\npractice for Hopkins. At no time was the<br />\nresult in doubt, and Hopkins did not exert<br />\nherself to win, but just to see how large she<br />\ncould make the score.<br />\nSo fast did the attack play in the first half<br />\nthat when time was called the score stood<br />\n9 to 0. Stevens' defense was very weak,<br />\nand Hopkins found no trouble in breaking<br />\nthrough it. Only once was there any difficulty, but the brace Stevens had taken did<br />\nnot last long, and it was again plain sailing<br />\nfor the Hopkins attack.<br />\nIn the second half Stevens seemed a little<br />\nstronger and worked the ball close in our<br />\ngoal, but McKinley failed at an easy try.<br />\nHopkins now got in some good old time zigzag play, and Erlanger soon shot the 10th<br />\ngoal. The ice was broken and one goal followed another in . quick succession so that<br />\nwhen time was called Hopkins had 15 goals<br />\nto her credit.<br />\nIt is very gratifying to the coaches tb see<br />\nthe improvement in the team, and when it<br />\nmeets Lehigh on Saturday it is to be hoped<br />\nthat a still further improvement will be seen.<br />\nThe line-up was:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nStevens.<br />\nW.

MEET.<br />\nThe members of the track team have been<br />\nhard at work for the past month, training<br />\nfor the relay races which take place next<br />\nSaturday at Philadelphia. Three times a<br />\nweek, weather permitting, coach McInnis has<br />\nhad the men out to the Maryland Oval getting in the best possible trim.<br />\nHopkins has a hard task before her this<br />\nyear, as the team is in a higher class than<br />\nlast year, and will run against the teams of<br />\nNew York University, Rutgers, City College<br />\nof New York, Swarthmore, and possibly<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\nThe team has been definitely decided upon<br />\nand will probably run in the order named:<br />\nStewart, Padgett, Perce, and Hill; Ed. Moreland substitute. Besides the relay races,<br />\nHill will be entered in the hurdles and the<br />\nbroad jump. George Scholl, an old member<br />\nof Hopkins' team, will contest in the high<br />\njump.<br />\nThe members of the track team all feel<br />\ngreatly indebted to \"Bill\" Hoffman for the<br />\ntrouble he has taken in assisting Dr. McInnis<br />\nto put the team in shape. In fact, if all the<br />\nalumni and undergraduates were as loyal as<br />\nhe has been, Hopkins would have nothing to<br />\nfear from any college of twice her size in<br />\nthe country.<br />\n'07.<br />\n<br />\nrattled twice, and this at times when it was<br />\nmost important to play a steady game.<br />\nBut as yet we are young in baseball, and<br />\njust as a child is quiet and wears a scared<br />\nlook on its face when it enters the presence<br />\nof its teacher for the first time, so I suppose<br />\nit was with the team when it crossed bats<br />\nwith the veterans of the diamond.<br />\nAt that stage of the game when three innings had been played and the score stood<br />\n2 to 0 in our favor, a satisfying smile could<br />\nbe seen breaking over the faces of the spectators, and as someone said \"we began to<br />\nbelieve we had a real baseball team.\"<br />\nBut all of our fond hopes were shattered<br />\nwhen next the wearers of the orange and<br />\nblack stepped to the bat.

The score was now tied,<br />\nand that fatal storm, the rattles, which had<br />\nbeen growing on the Hopkins men for some<br />\ntime, now burst forth in all its fury, and before it had passed over the Princetonians<br />\nhad chalked down six runs to their credit.<br />\n<br />\nIn the next inning the team steadied down,<br />\nshut out its opponents and scored one run.<br />\nBut there still remained traces of the storm<br />\nPRINCETON, 11; HOPKINS, 4. which had played such havoc in the fourth<br />\ninning.

But the<br />\nproudest year in the whole long existence<br />\nof the aristocratic old watering-place was<br />\nthat in which it had the privilege of entertaining at once the captain of a Johns Hopkins lacrosse team and the captain of a Yale<br />\nfootball team. At least that is what all the<br />\nsmall boys thought, and their big sisters<br />\nwere almost unanimously of the same opinion.<br />\nDuring this memorable summer, Betty<br />\nCarleton, of Richmond, was spending a<br />\nmonth at White Sulphur at the cottage of<br />\nher best friend, Jane Thompson. Betty and<br />\nJane had graduated a few weeks before from<br />\nthe Woman's College of Baltimore, and<br />\nthrough the four years of their college life<br />\ntheir friendship had been like that of David<br />\nand Jonathan. Class-mates said this was<br />\nbecause the two girls were so different.<br />\nBetty was admitted to have been the most<br />\nattractive girl in the school, beautiful, witty,<br />\nand inclined to be romantic. Jane was plain,<br />\nmatter-of-fact, and entirely practical. When<br />\nBetty had been chief editor of \"Donnybrook<br />\nFair,\" Jane had been business manager, and<br />\nhad brought Betty's sparkling, but random<br />\neffusions to an orderly and successful publication. Thus it had always been with them,<br />\nBetty began things, Jane finished them;<br />\nBetty was continually rushing into difficulties, Jane continually rescuing her; Betty<br />\nfurnished the firm's stock in trade of beauty<br />\nand genius, Jane was the real managing part-<br /><br />\nner; Betty got all the glory, Jane was modestly content with being the acknowledged<br />\nchum of such a prodigy, and with receiving<br />\nin private that prodigy's entire love, trust,<br />\nand unbounded admiration.<br />\nOf course, Betty, like every Woman's College girl, knew the Hopkins captain by sight,<br />\njust as he knew her by reputation. She<br />\nrecognized the lithe figure and the pleasant<br />\nface with its keen gray eyes, the moment she<br />\nsaw their possessor alight from the hotel<br />\n'bus. By a strange coincidence, the Yale<br />\ncaptain made his appearance on the afternoon of the same day. His arrival created<br />\neven more popular stir, if possible, than that<br />\nof the Hopkins man had done. With two.<br />\nsuch celebrities present, the Cabinet official<br />\nwho arrived on the night train, was completely ignored.<br />\nThe coming of the second hero was announced to the girls by an excited little<br />\nbrother of Jane. \"He's awful big,\" the lad<br />\ndeclared, in response to a little surreptitious<br />\nencouragement from Betty; \"four times as<br />\nbig as the Hopkins feller. I heard the<br />\nsprings creak when he got in the 'bus; and<br />\nyou'd better believe the porters moved when<br />\nhe told 'em to N'en he's got curly yellow<br />\nhair, and blue eyes.\" He paused a moment<br />\nfor breath, then plunged his hand into his<br />\npocket and brought forth part of a leaf torn<br />\nfrom one of last fall's sporting journals.<br />\n\"Here's his picture,\" the boy affirmed proudly. \"Harry Jones traded it to me for a dead<br />\nsnake.\" The girls gazed eagerly at the<br />\ndirty scrap of paper\u2014ati least, Betty did;<br />\nJane never showed so active an interest in<br />\nthings masculine. It was a heavy, goodnatured face, and that was all the two girls<br />\ncould glean from the likeness. Beneath,<br />\nhowever, was printed a concise description;<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n\"Weight 214 lbs.; height 6 ft. 2 in.; age 24<br />\nyrs.; has played at guard for Yale for four<br />\nyears, the hardest line-bucker in the country.\"<br />\nBetty handed back the print and looked<br />\nthoughtful. Then she said slowly,\"I believe,<br />\nJane, that after all I shall accept Mrs. Powell's invitation to hear the band at the Grand<br />\nCentral to-night.<br />\n\"There was a mighty hunter, and his prey<br />\nwas man,\" quoted Jane, with a smile.<br />\nBetty looked guilty, and consequently even<br />\nmore ravishing than usual. \"I don't care,\"<br />\nshe said; \"at any rate, this is a new species<br />\nof game. Outside of Tommy Smith, and Joe<br />\nArmstrong, and John Waters, and a dozen<br />\nor so of those foolish Hopkins men, I've had<br />\nno experience at all with athletes.\"<br />\n\"How about that Baltimore Athletic Club<br />\nman?\" queried Jane.<br />\nBetty gurgled. \"The creature wrote a<br />\npoem about me, in which he called me a 'ten<br />\nstrike'; so I had to 'bowl him out' in selfdefense.\"<br />\nThree hours later, two famous athletes<br />\nwere introduced to a. vision in white chiffon<br />\n--a vision with the most wonderful goldenbrown hair, and the biggest, most innocent<br />\nbrown eyes, and the most bewitching smile<br />\nthey had ever seen. At the same time they<br />\nwere introduced to a prim, flaxen-haired<br />\nyoung woman, with honest blue eyes and<br />\ndecided manners; but both were too much<br />\novercome by the vision to pay much attention to her. At the end of the evening the<br />\nsame two athletes were in a very dazed<br />\nstate of mind; and several score of other<br />\nmen whose turns had already come, nudged<br />\neach other and said it was just what they<br />\nhad expected.<br />\nBetty\u2014for the vision was Betty\u2014spent the<br />\nnext morning showing the Yale man about<br />\nthe grounds; that afternoon the Hopkins<br />\nman dropped in for a little chat about mutual friends in Baltimore; in the evening,<br />\nboth men called. This was but the beginning. At the end of a week, during which<br />\nthe double assault never for an instant wavered, Betty confided to Jane that the life was<br />\nalmost too strenuous for her.<br />\n\"If this pace does not soon slacken\u2014observe the result of athletic associations!\u2014I<br />\nshall be a wreck,\" she declared, dimpling.<br />\n\"I have carried on simultaneous perform-<br /><br />\nances before, but compared with this they<br />\nwere merely what parlor theatricals are to<br />\na two-ringed circus.\" Jane made no response, and Betty continued, \"Still, athletes<br />\nare such a delightful change. So headstrong,<br />\nand fiery and determined. I wouldn't have<br />\nmissed them for the world.\" Jane's silence<br />\nmust have carried some note of protest with<br />\nit, for here Betty suddenly flung her arms<br />\nabout her, and whispered, \"Ile wouldn't<br />\nmind, you goose!\"<br />\nBetty did not break down after the first<br />\nweek as she had threatened, nor after yet<br />\nanother. In the meantime all Betty's former<br />\nadmirers had beat a temporary retreat leaving a clear field for the athletes,<br />\nSince the chief actors in the little drama<br />\nwere the two best-known men and the most<br />\npopular girl at the Springs, the state of<br />\nthings could not help awakening much interest among the other guests. As the campaign progressed, speculation about the final<br />\nresult grew and grew until it became the<br />\nchief subject of conversation. People would<br />\ndiscuss at breakfast whether they should<br />\nwalk, or read, or watch the Yale-Hopkins<br />\nmatch. Some of the younger men even did<br />\na little betting on the result.<br />\nFor her part, Betty was absolutely impartial in her treatment of her two admirers.<br />\nIf she went to \"Lovers' Leap\" one day with<br />\nCaptain Hopkins, she would even it off by a<br />\ntrip to the Lithia Spring the next day with<br />\nCaptain Yale. If she went riding with one,<br />\nshe would play tennis with the other.<br />\nNeither to the rivals themselves, nor to any<br />\none else, did Betty give any hint as to which<br />\nshe preferred, or even whether either one<br />\nmeant the slightest thing to her. One young<br />\nRichmond man who knew something of Betty<br />\nat home, and who had been to Harvard, was<br />\nemphatic in his views that the last surmise<br />\nwas the correct one.<br />\nAlthough the two men had been equally<br />\nquick in succumbing to Betty's charms, their<br />\nmethods of love-making were radically difThe Hopkins man made his apferent.<br />\nproaches in a steady and systematic manner.<br />\nThe principles were the same he had used<br />\nwith such success upon the lacrosse field\u2014<br />\nno wild long passes, no reckless shots for<br />\ngoal, but a constant endeavor to carry the<br />\nball steadily forward, and then, when the<br />\ntime came, to shoot goal. The Yale aspirant<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwent about his work with a reckless abandon<br />\nthat was truly sublime. Day after day, he<br />\nwould blindly \"buck the line\" in the hope<br />\nof sometime making a touchdown. Before<br />\nthe end of the first week, and daily since<br />\nthen, he had been at the point of blundering<br />\nout the story of his devotion; but each time<br />\nBetty's trained eye perceived the symptoms,<br />\nand the threatened attack was warded off.<br />\nBut all three parties to this triangular<br />\ngame had reckoned without due regard to<br />\none very important factor in the situation.<br />\nThis factor was Jane. Jane waited for a<br />\ngood opportunity to talk with Betty and<br />\nfound it after supper one night. She opened<br />\nthe discussion with a kiss, an ominous sign,<br />\nas Betty knew. Then she announced, \"Betty, this must stop at once! You have no<br />\nright to carry on in any such way, and you<br />\nknow it. Either you find some way out of<br />\nit yourself, or I tell them all about it tonight.\" So far this had been like Jane.<br />\nShe had stated in a nutshell both her opinions and her intentions with regard to the<br />\nmatter. Then she did something very unlike herself. She flung herself on Betty's<br />\nneck and cried. \"Oh, Betty,\" she sobbed,\"I<br />\ndid not think you could be so heartless.<br />\nWhat would Tom think?\" Betty was astonished, or pretended to be. \"Think?\" she<br />\ncried. \"Why, think nothing at all, of course.<br />\nYou know very well I like him a thousand<br />\ntimes better than any one else.\"<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nWhatever the kind or the number of argiunents that Jane used\u2014and the sun had set<br />\nand the twilight nearly gone before the conference ended\u2014the upshot of it all was, that<br />\nwhen the athletic gentlemen arrived shortly<br />\nafter, they were told that Betty would not<br />\nbe able to see them. \"She's had so much<br />\nbother over her sewing lately that she has<br />\nworried herself into a headache,\" Jane explained. \"She has so much to do to get<br />\nready,\" she added mysteriously.<br />\n\"Ah,\" rejoined the mystified pair politely.<br />\n\"It's to come off in the early fall, you<br />\nknow,\" she continued. Each man glared<br />\nsuspiciously at the other.<br />\n\"Surely, Betty has told you about it,<br />\nhasn't she? Well, of course, it has not been<br />\nannounced yet, but it is well understood<br />\namong her friends.\"<br />\n\"You mean,\" ventured the Hopkins man<br />\nat last, \"that Miss Carleton is to be married?\"<br />\n\"Why, yes,\" said Jane innocently, \"to<br />\nJack Cary, with whom she has been brought<br />\nup. They've been sweethearts almost ever<br />\nsince they could talk. It's a very pretty<br />\nstory. I should have thought Betty would<br />\nhave told you. Jack graduated at Harvard<br />\nthe year before last, and is now in England<br />\nattending to some business of his father's<br />\nlaw firm, in which he is soon to become<br />\njunior partner. Oh, surely you do not have<br />\nto leave so soon!\"<br /><br />\nWHITE WINGS.<br /><br />\nShe lingered for a while beside life's sea,<br />\nGathering strange, lovely thoughts to string like shells<br />\nIn lyric lengths of song,<br />\nNumbering the rythinic beating of the deep,<br />\nWatching the soft, clear day steal from the east,<br />\nOr westward fading, touch the crinkling waves<br />\nWith tender glory; and she saw the boats<br />\nGlide with ribbed sails across the sun, and flit<br />\nWhit'ning through the blue distance, where afar<br />\nThe heavenly country lies all wrapped in mist.<br />\nThere most of all she gazed, and if a gleam<br />\nThreaded the mist, her passionate, grave eyes<br />\nWith more than earthly lustre caught its light;<br />\nThus did she live until her soul took wing<br />\nAnd vanished, like some white bird, in the blue.<br />\n\u2014Elsie Mitchell Rushmore, in the Vassar Miscellany.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE VICTORY OVER BROWN.<br /><br />\nNegative<br /><br />\nAs the echoes of the oratorical eloquence,<br />\nwhich shook the windows of McCoy Hall on<br />\nthe evening of April 8, have had three weeks<br />\nin which to tickle the ears of our readers,<br />\nit would be superfluous to announce at this<br />\nlate date that Hopkins did Brown up brown<br />\n\u2014besides, that's a poor pun. However, for<br />\nthe sake of those who did not hear the debate itself or whose ears are not ticklish we<br />\nherewith give a brief summary.<br />\nThe question, for which the shirt fronts of<br />\nthe orators creaked, was \"Resolved, That<br />\nthe economic and political interests of the<br />\nUnited States demand the permanent retention of the Philippine Islands.\" We didn't<br />\nresolve that, it was Brown who did, but<br />\nnevertheless, after two hours of wordy dispute, we convinced them, that is Brown, of<br />\ncourse, that we Hopkins, had taken a better<br />\nstand than they, that is, Brown\u2014say, look<br />\nhere, Hopkins won. President hernsen gave<br />\nthe address of welcome and after he had<br />\nconvinced everyone of his sincerity, and the<br />\nGlee Club had been successfully subdued,<br />\nMr. Hurley, first speaker for Brown, was<br />\nintroduced. Resting his right arm\u2014or maybe it was his left\u2014gracefully on Dr. Green's<br />\npulpit, which had been brought down for the<br />\noccasion, Mr. Hurley told us an awful lot.<br />\nThen successively we learned from each<br />\nspeaker of each team, that the other side<br />\nwas woefully ignorant of the question at<br />\nissue.<br />\nThe Hopkins men, either from a<br />\nsense of superior learning, or from the nervousness which Moth\u2014 Dr. Green's pulpit<br />\nnaturally creates, did not rest its several<br />\narms gracefully thereon.<br />\nAt 10.32 P. M., Justice Clabaugh, chairman of the Judges began to tell us who had<br />\nwon, and at 10.39 we learned that Hopkins<br />\nhad done Brown up brown.

Either the<br />\n\"Hullabaloos\" were class books, pure and<br />\nsimple, so that to the Junior, and especially<br />\nto the Freshmen class, they were more or<br />\nless unintelligible, or else (which is still<br />\nworse) they were composed of a lot of unimportant general information which had<br />\nvery little to do with the Senior class.<br />\nRealizing that the \"Hullabaloo\" should be<br />\nprimarily a class book, and yet contain many<br />\n\"hits\" on persons and things familiar to<br />\nJuniors and Freshmen, the editors have kept<br />\nthese two ideas constantly before them, and<br />\nthey believe they have struck a happy medium.<br />\nThe marked character of the book will be<br />\nits originality. Ideas which have been<br />\nworked up in former \"Hullabaloos\" every<br />\ntwo or three years, so that they have become<br />\nalmost legitimate prey, have been discarded.<br />\nMany features of the daily life at the University have been considered, and only those<br />\nhave been chosen which offer the best chance<br />\nfor caricature or \"grinds.\"<br />\nAn entirely new and handsome cover has<br />\nbeen designed which sets the book off very<br />\neffectively. The ground color will be black<br />\nwith a blue stripe running diagonally across,<br />\ndividing the cover into two sections. The<br />\nlower section will contain the 1905 class pin,<br />\nenlarged to about twice the actual size, while<br />\nthe upper section will contain the title. Of<br />\ncourse, it is hardly necessary to say that the<br />\nshape of the .book will be the same as that<br />\nof former \"Hullabaloos.\"<br />\nIt is in the artistic feature that the book<br />\nwill surpass all those previously turned out.<br />\nNo pains or expense have been spared in obtaining illustrations, which, if proper to the<br />\nspirit of the life at the University, always<br /><br />\nhave so much t\u00e1 do with making the book<br />\npopular. The Board has been so fortunate<br />\nas to secure outside as well as Baltimore<br />\ntalent. Among the well-known artists who<br />\nhave contributed are J. Louis Brooks of New<br />\nYork, McKee Barclay and \"Sam\" Theobald<br />\nof this city, and several others. The \"Hullabaloo\" is also fortunate in having two class<br />\nartists who have outdone themselves in making the annual attractive. There will be six<br />\nor seven pages devoted to girls, all of whom<br />\nare said by the Board to be especially attractive. Besides these there will be three<br />\nfull page drawings, something that no other<br />\n\"Hullabaloo\" has ever attempted. Their<br />\ntitles will be \"Under the Anheuser-Busch,\"<br />\n\"Two Ways of Enlarging the Heart,\" and<br />\n\"Attending a Post-Graduate Course at the<br />\nSummer School.\"<br />\nAnother feature which has been carefully<br />\nworked up and enlarged is the Athletics.<br />\nThis should be especially interesting this<br />\nyear on account of the revival of interest in<br />\nseveral sports. Each athletic team will be<br />\ngiven a full-page picture. In addition, there<br />\nwill be in the part devoted to Track, the<br />\ndescription of the dual meet with Virginia<br />\nlast May, and a comparison of the records<br />\nat the University with those of a college in<br />\nour class, i. e., one against whom we run in<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania relay races.<br />\nAn especially interesting leading article<br />\non \"College Life\" has been contributed by<br />\nDr. F. H. Sykes, a Hopkins graduate, now<br />\nin Columbia University.<br />\nIn this article only a few of the prominent<br />\nfeatures of the book have been mentioned.<br />\nLittle has been said about the articles themselves, but the Board can assure everyone<br />\nthat \"there are surprises coming,\" and from<br />\nvarious quarters, too.<br />\nThe Board wishes to thank the NEwsLETTER for the chance given to \"exploit\"<br />\nthemselves and their work. They have tried<br />\nmost earnestly to bring out a book which will<br />\ndo credit to their class, and in this spirit they<br />\nhave dedicated it to Naughty-Five.<br />\nIn conclusion, the Board wishes it to be<br />\nknown that they will adjourn to Atlantic<br />\nCity for their health when the \"Hullabaloo\"<br />\nappears. They can only be reached by the<br />\nlong distance phone.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nEbe Slew\"Letter.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the<br />\nStudents of TRIO JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nAPRIL 28, lit05.<br />\nSubscriptions $1.50 per year.<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Ed;tor,<br />\nAssistant News Editors<br />\nAthletic Editors<br /><br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br /><br />\nORMOND W.

Following the annual custom, the election was held<br />\njust before the Easter vacation, with what<br />\nresults the reader can see for himself by<br />\nglancing above.<br />\nTo speak in terms of praise of what has<br />\nbeen accomplished by the retiring editors<br />\nwould be a work of supererogation. The<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, as it now is, is practically a<br />\nmonument to the ability, the energy and<br />\nthe faithfulness of the editors from the Class<br />\nof 1905. We do not mean to imply that the<br />\npaper has as yet even approximated a state<br />\nof perfection. Neither do we wish to cast<br />\nany reflection upon the management in previous years. Yet the fact remains\u2014a fact<br />\nwhich, we feel sure, is patent to every reader<br />\n\u2014that in the past twelve months theNEwsUTTER has taken a rather remarkable stride<br />\nforward.<br />\nWith respect to the new men upon the<br />\nBoard the paper feels that it is sincerely to<br />\nbe congratulated. Both Mr. Reynolds and<br />\nMr. Bloomfield have given ample proof of<br />\ntheir eminent fitness for the duties of the<br />\npositions to which they have been elected.<br />\nThe choice was made upon the results of an<br />\nopen competition lasting since October, in<br />\nwhich a large number of students took part.<br />\nThe general excellence of the work done by<br />\nthe candidates as a whole was such as to<br />\nleave room for but one regret\u2014that all could<br /><br />\nnot be elected. To those whose efforts have<br />\nso far been in vain we offer our earnest<br />\nthanks for their work, and bid them still hope. One position, that of assistant athletic editor, is still open. The number of<br />\ncandidates for this position has been so large<br />\nthat it was thought unfair to make a decision<br />\nuntil the relative ability of those trying for<br />\nthe place could be more accurately gauged.<br />\nThe election will take place within a month,<br />\nhowever, and the competition is still open<br />\nto all.<br />\nAnd now permit the new Board a word<br />\nupon the subject of its policy and intentions.<br />\nWe have said that the NEWS-LETTER is far<br />\nfrom perfect. We recognize this fact very<br />\nkeenly. First of all, we believe the paper<br />\nlacks life and \"ginger.\" Standing, as it<br />\ndoes, in the anomalous position of being at<br />\nonce a newspaper and a literary magazine,<br />\nthe difficulty has always been to co-ordinate<br />\nthese two ends sucessfully. The \"news\" has<br />\nshowed a tendency to read like ancient history, while the original matter has been<br />\nnotable only in its brevity. The new management purposes to obviate this difficulty<br />\nas far as possible by devoting less space to<br />\nthe description of past events; to write all<br />\nsuch happenings as must be taken notice of<br />\nin a style which will make the story interesting even if the matter be \"stale;\" and<br />\nto give more space to original work of a literary character.<br />\nA second fault which we find with the<br />\npaper in its present form is that it does not<br />\nenter fully enough into the life of the University. A college paper should be the vehicle for transmitting the thought of the students. It should mirror public opinion, and<br />\nin some measure mould it. That the NEwsLETTER has never accomplished this purpose<br />\nis largely the fault of the students themselves. Under no circumstances could the<br />\nthought and opinions of a small coterie of<br />\neditors accurately represent the sentiments<br />\nof the nine hundred or more persons connected with the University. To remedy this<br />\nfault we throw our columns open to all. We<br />\ninvite contributions. Open letters, expressions of opinion, proposals of reforms or criticisms of .ex,isting conditions, humorous or<br />\nserious literary matter\u2014in short anything<br />\nwhich may be of interest to the students will<br />\nbe gladly published.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nThat is briefly the attitude of the new staff.<br />\nThe editors are aware that it is an ambitious<br />\none. They do not delude themselves with<br />\nthe belief that the reforms they outline so<br />\nglibly will be entirely achieved. With the<br />\nassistance of the student body, however, they<br />\nbelieve a large amount of success is possible,<br />\nand failure to attain it will be due to lack<br />\nof ability, not to lack of spirit.<br />\nConsistency is admittedly a rare and beautiful virtue; but like all virtues it may be<br />\noverdone. Carried to extremes, Consistency<br />\nbecomes Monotony; and of this very simple<br />\npsychological truth the N4ws-LETTER would<br />\nlike, in all delicacy, to remind the baseball<br />\nteam.<br />\nBat Consistency is not the only noble characteristic which our nine has given evidence<br />\nof possessing. After conclusively proving<br />\nto the world in its first game how strong it<br />\nreally was, did it not, with a truly Spartan<br />\nfortitude, deliberately cast fame to the winds<br />\nand firmly refuse to build up a reputation<br />\nat the expense of the sufferings of less powerful brothers? Did it not rather choose to<br />\nsacrifice its own interests to those of these<br />\nmore needy teams, and like a good Samaritan spend its time \"going round about doing<br />\ngood?\" Charity, magnanimity, self-sacrifice, brotherly love, are only a few of the<br />\nlofty virtues of which our baseball team is<br />\nthe living exponent.<br />\nThe N4ws-Lwrm feels like a pig, and no<br />\ngentleman, in finding fault. But it does find<br />\nfault. Sir Philip Sidney is out of place nowa-days\u2014at least on the baseball field. Besides, as we said at the beginning, extremes<br />\nare always obnoxious. Better far the \"golden middle path.\" Let's lose sometimes\u2014<br />\nwhen we have to\u2014but not always. There's<br />\ntruth in Horace's<br />\n\"Salus in mediocritate.\"<br />\nPrompt payment of debts has by many<br />\nleading business men been denominated the<br />\nkey-stone of success. Believe us, then, that<br />\nit is with a firm conviction of the truth of this<br />\nview and with a sincere regard for the future<br />\nwelfare of our readers that the NEwsLETTER ventures to touch upon a somewhat<br />\ndelicate subject.<br />\nOn February 1 the annual bills were sent<br />\nto the readers of the paper. A large propor-<br /><br />\ntion were promptly paid, but the number remaining unsettled is still so large as to lead<br />\nus to fear that the ideas of some of our<br />\nfriends upon the \"key-stone of success\" are<br />\nrather vague and shadowy. There are also<br />\na few subscribers who have not yet paid last<br />\nyear's bills. Either the financial condition<br />\nor the business ethics of these persons must<br />\nbe in a .deplorable state.<br />\nIn all seriousness, if you have not yet attended to your bill, let us request that you<br />\nmake it a point to do so at your earliest convenience.<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY NOTES.<br />\nPresident Remsen met his class in graduchemistry the other morning, in a lectureroom in which the temperature was uncomfortably chilly.

The chief interest in the<br />\ngame centered around the new players, and<br />\nmany enthusiasts turned out to get a line<br />\non the men and to see how the team would<br />\npull together. It must be said, however,<br />\nthat the crowd of spectators was made up<br />\nof graduates, outsiders, and the same small<br />\nbunch of undergraduates that loyally supports all branches of athletic sport. The<br />\nlack of interest among the undergraduates<br />\nmight be attributed to the bad weather, but<br />\ncertainly it seems to be \"up to\" the studentbody to support the lacrosse team more materially than .they did at the opening game.<br />\nThe coaches, Dr. McInnes and Schmeisser,<br />\ndeserve a great deal of credit for getting the<br />\nnew men into shape. Armstrong, McSherry,<br />\nTough and W. Blanck played a good game,<br />\nconsidering that it was their first collegiate<br />\ncontest. Armstrong, being new, was not at<br />\nhis best in the early stages of the game, but<br />\nimproved in the second half, getting three<br />\nout of the six goals made in this period.<br />\nMcSherry, at third defense, put up a game<br />\nfight and with his weight should make a good<br />\nplayer. Tough showed up the best of the<br />\nnew men, and covered his position in fine<br />\nstyle. W. Blanck had few chances to display his worth owing to the fine defense<br />\ngame played by Schmeisser and Fred<br />\nBlanck, but he managed to keep the ball outside of the goal. Of the old men, Strobhar<br /><br />\nand Dill excelled in the attack, while the<br />\nwhole defense played a heady game.<br />\nIn the second half our men were more confident, and much fresher than their opponents, and did not have so much difficulty<br />\nin scoring, making six goals. During this<br />\nhalf McSherry and his opponent, Olpp, put<br />\ntheir heads together and decided that the<br />\ninterest was lagging. The result was that<br />\nMac danced a Highland fling on his shoulders<br />\nfor the benefit of the spectators. Referee<br />\nCole decided that Olpp should retire to the<br />\ntall timbers to cool off, but at the request of<br />\nCaptain Dill the referee permitted him to<br />\nresume his position, and the game proceeded.<br />\nToward the end several substitutions were<br />\nmade to try out new men.<br />\nOur line-up was:<br />\nArmstrong,in-home; Strobhar, out-home; Hudgins,<br />\nfirst attack; Erlanger, second attack; Dill (capt.),<br />\nthird attack; Tough, center; McSherry, H.

How<br />\nhard fought was the game might be seen<br />\nfrom the score-4 to 3; but no one, who was<br />\nnot present, can realize the severity of the<br />\nstruggle and the intense interest of the spectators. The Harvard team was heavy, and<br />\nhad been well drilled in the game by Abner<br />\nSaylor, a \"star\" on the Hopkins team in<br />\n1902. Saylor played first attack for the<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nvisitors, and by far excelled any of his teammates. Smith, another old Hopkinsite, who<br />\nplayea out-home on the Crimson team, came<br />\nnext in excellence.<br />\nThe great disappointment of the game was<br />\nthe slump taken by our attack. All the men,<br />\nwith the exception of Dill and Strobhar,<br />\nshowed a tendency to drop the ball at critical moments, and also failed to follow up<br />\ntheir shots. The defence played a beautiful<br />\ngame and seemed to work well together.<br />\nWalter Blanck at goal made some remarkable stops, and well proved that he is of<br />\n'varsity caliber.<br />\nCaptain Dill made quite a hit with the<br />\n.ladies by his skillful picking up. One young<br />\nlady remarked that \"he was perfectly irresistible.\" W. Blanck had the jump on Harvard's goal-keeper, for whereas the Harvard<br />\nman was protected by well padded football<br />\nclothes, Walter carries his pads wher'er he<br />\ngoes and thus does away with superfluous<br />\nclothes. McRae, Meyer and McSherry took<br />\nturns in spilling Sayler, and managed to<br />\nkeep the Harvard attack busy. The coolest<br />\nmen in the game were Fred Blanck and Bill<br />\nSchmeisser, both of whom played gilt-edged<br />\nlacrosse.<br />\nThe line-up was:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nHarvard.<br />\nW.

Several changes were made in the<br />\nline-up, and in most cases they seem to be<br />\nwise ones. It would seem that the ideal<br />\ncombination has been found, and as a result<br />\nthe men are beginning to show up in real<br />\nchampionship style.<br />\nThe Stevens men were a fine set of fellows,<br />\nbut from the beginning it was seen that they<br />\ncould not play lacrosse. To be serious, the<br />\ngame was nothing more than a good hard<br />\npractice for Hopkins. At no time was the<br />\nresult in doubt, and Hopkins did not exert<br />\nherself to win, but just to see how large she<br />\ncould make the score.<br />\nSo fast did the attack play in the first half<br />\nthat when time was called the score stood<br />\n9 to 0. Stevens' defense was very weak,<br />\nand Hopkins found no trouble in breaking<br />\nthrough it. Only once was there any difficulty, but the brace Stevens had taken did<br />\nnot last long, and it was again plain sailing<br />\nfor the Hopkins attack.<br />\nIn the second half Stevens seemed a little<br />\nstronger and worked the ball close in our<br />\ngoal, but McKinley failed at an easy try.<br />\nHopkins now got in some good old time zigzag play, and Erlanger soon shot the 10th<br />\ngoal. The ice was broken and one goal followed another in . quick succession so that<br />\nwhen time was called Hopkins had 15 goals<br />\nto her credit.<br />\nIt is very gratifying to the coaches tb see<br />\nthe improvement in the team, and when it<br />\nmeets Lehigh on Saturday it is to be hoped<br />\nthat a still further improvement will be seen.<br />\nThe line-up was:<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\nStevens.<br />\nW.

MEET.<br />\nThe members of the track team have been<br />\nhard at work for the past month, training<br />\nfor the relay races which take place next<br />\nSaturday at Philadelphia. Three times a<br />\nweek, weather permitting, coach McInnis has<br />\nhad the men out to the Maryland Oval getting in the best possible trim.<br />\nHopkins has a hard task before her this<br />\nyear, as the team is in a higher class than<br />\nlast year, and will run against the teams of<br />\nNew York University, Rutgers, City College<br />\nof New York, Swarthmore, and possibly<br />\nSyracuse.<br />\nThe team has been definitely decided upon<br />\nand will probably run in the order named:<br />\nStewart, Padgett, Perce, and Hill; Ed. Moreland substitute. Besides the relay races,<br />\nHill will be entered in the hurdles and the<br />\nbroad jump. George Scholl, an old member<br />\nof Hopkins' team, will contest in the high<br />\njump.<br />\nThe members of the track team all feel<br />\ngreatly indebted to \"Bill\" Hoffman for the<br />\ntrouble he has taken in assisting Dr. McInnis<br />\nto put the team in shape. In fact, if all the<br />\nalumni and undergraduates were as loyal as<br />\nhe has been, Hopkins would have nothing to<br />\nfear from any college of twice her size in<br />\nthe country.<br />\n'07.<br /><br />\nrattled twice, and this at times when it was<br />\nmost important to play a steady game.<br />\nBut as yet we are young in baseball, and<br />\njust as a child is quiet and wears a scared<br />\nlook on its face when it enters the presence<br />\nof its teacher for the first time, so I suppose<br />\nit was with the team when it crossed bats<br />\nwith the veterans of the diamond.<br />\nAt that stage of the game when three innings had been played and the score stood<br />\n2 to 0 in our favor, a satisfying smile could<br />\nbe seen breaking over the faces of the spectators, and as someone said \"we began to<br />\nbelieve we had a real baseball team.\"<br />\nBut all of our fond hopes were shattered<br />\nwhen next the wearers of the orange and<br />\nblack stepped to the bat. Waring allowed<br />\nHeim to walk, the next one up singled to<br />\nMcDonnell who made an error, and Heim<br />\ncrossed the plate for Princeton's first run.<br />\nCooney, that old warhorse of football fame,<br />\nthen stepped up to the plate and whacked<br />\nout a two-bagger which brought in another<br />\nrun for Princeton. The score was now tied,<br />\nand that fatal storm, the rattles, which had<br />\nbeen growing on the Hopkins men for some<br />\ntime, now burst forth in all its fury, and before it had passed over the Princetonians<br />\nhad chalked down six runs to their credit.<br /><br />\nIn the next inning the team steadied down,<br />\nshut out its opponents and scored one run.<br />\nBut there still remained traces of the storm<br />\nPRINCETON, 11; HOPKINS, 4. which had played such havoc in the fourth<br />\ninning.
