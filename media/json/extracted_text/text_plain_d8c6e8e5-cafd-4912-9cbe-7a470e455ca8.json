These traditions have<br />\nexisted at The Hopkins for many \u2022years. But who or what<br />\nkeeps these traditions from becoming stagnant? Is it not<br />\ntrue that Hopkins men are responsible for their vitality by<br />\npassing them down from class to class?<br />\nIt is our privilege to enjoy these Heritages, and it is<br />\nour responsibility to propagate them not only by abiding by<br />\nthe Code and Way of Life, but by demanding of each other<br />\nunrelenting effort to make certain everyone appreciates<br />\nthese heritages, recognizes and corrects their faults and perpetuates their merits.

These traditions have<br />\nexisted at The Hopkins for many \u2022years. But who or what<br />\nkeeps these traditions from becoming stagnant? Is it not<br />\ntrue that Hopkins men are responsible for their vitality by<br />\npassing them down from class to class?<br />\nIt is our privilege to enjoy these Heritages, and it is<br />\nour responsibility to propagate them not only by abiding by<br />\nthe Code and Way of Life, but by demanding of each other<br />\nunrelenting effort to make certain everyone appreciates<br />\nthese heritages, recognizes and corrects their faults and perpetuates their merits. For to only accept and not improve<br />\nthem is to let them lie fallow to die. It is up to the student to<br />\nput his most into Hopkins, thus preserving the University's<br />\nvitality and Way of Life.<br />\nUnceasing contribution in one's field of talent, no matter what the area be, will satisfy this requirement. The<br />\navowed purpose of almost every university is the development of the inherent abilities of its students. But The Hopkins is outstanding in that it expects its students to perpetuate the sytem;'<br />\nit does not depend solely, or even to a<br />\nlarge degree, on a development enforced from above.
