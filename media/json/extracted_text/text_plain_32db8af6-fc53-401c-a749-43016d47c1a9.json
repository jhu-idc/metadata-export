The not over-brilliant showing made by the<br />\nFootball team last fall has been more than offset by the splendid work<br />\nof the Lacrosse team this spring, the defeat (which by the way was<br />\nnearly a victory) at the Annapolis meet was atoned for by the victory over Virginia. And so<br />\nit is always in life. Even the NEWS-LETTER has had like experiences\u2014but in spite of the<br />\nmental defeats of the Board of Editors when vainly trying to think up a new joke, we too<br />\nhave our victories\u2014of which the promise of another successful year next winter is a notable<br />\none.<br />\n<br />\n\f(.-If/eI.

It was this it was not hard for him to become pessimistic.<br />\nexpression which first told her what her \"After all,\" he thought, \"what reason have I<br />\nthoughtlessness had done,and, as she recalled to think she cares for me.

The thought that she<br />\nthan two years, and, tho' the friendship which could atone for her folly when she next saw<br />\nhad existed between them from the beginning Harry seemed to bring little comfort. Next<br />\nof their acquaintance had been very pleasant time seemed so vague and far-off. When she<br />\nand matter-of-fact, her woman's intuition had awoke, after a few hours of troubled sleep, it<br />\ntold her sometime since that she was becom- was with a dull sense of present or impending<br />\ning more to him than could be expressed in calamity. She dressed and went down to the<br />\nthe word \"friend.\" She did not question her breakfast-room, but none of the other memown heart, but was quite content to let mat- bers of the family had yet made their appearters rest as they were. She acknowledged the ance. The morning paper lay beside her<br />\ncongeniality between him and herself and father's plate, and, as she picked it up and<br />\nrecognized the full value of the sterling glanced carelessly over it, her eye fell upon<br />\nqualities which he possessed, but her heart the following notice: Died\u2014\"Of heart-failure,<br />\nwas in no hurry to own the master, and she on July 20th, Henry Gaylord at 362 Nelson<br />\nchatted and danced with other men, often Street.\"<br />\nfinding compensation for the lack of pleasure<br />\nPutting the paper back in its place she<br />\nwhich she found in their company in her returned to her room, hardly comprehending<br />\nmischievous enjoyment of the look of annoy- the meaning of what she had read. There<br />\nance on Harry's face.<br />\ncould be no doubt about it\u2014\"Henry Gaylord<br />\nOn the evening in question there had been at 362 Nelson Street;\" his name was probably<br />\nsomething in Harry Gaylord's manner when Henry, altho she had always kuown him as<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHarry, and the address given was certainly<br />\nhis. Then like a flash she remembered how,<br />\non the preceding evening, he had suddenly<br />\nturned pale and stopped in the middle of a<br />\nsentence, but had assured her that it was only<br />\na sharp pain around the heart which the<br />\nDoctor said was nothing serious\u2014and now,<br />\nhe was gone ! gone, before she could tell him<br />\nhow sorry she was, yes, and something else,<br />\ntoo, which she had just discovered herself<br />\nnow that he was gone forever.<br />\nSo the day dragged on, Elizabeth scarcely<br />\nknew how. She pleaded headache\u2014which<br />\nwas certainly no idle excuse\u2014and shut herself up with the three great facts of her life:<br />\nthat she loved Harry Gaylord with all the<br />\nstrength of her being, that she had done him<br />\na great wrong, and that he was gone !<br />\nIn the meantime 362 Nelson Street was the<br />\nscene of what might be termed a tragic<br />\ncomedy. The crape on the door showed that<br />\ndeath had set its seal there, while there was<br />\nthe coming and going and profusion of<br />\nflowers that mark such occasions, yet there<br />\nwas something in the expression of those who<br />\ncame out of the house that would have puzzled an observer.<br />\nA lady, dressed in black and carrying a<br />\nbunch of ferns and roses, ascended the steps<br />\nand entered the hall. Strangely enough Mrs.<br />\nGaylord was there, and though she wore deep<br />\nback, one could almost imagine that she<br />\nsmiled. Not noticing her quiet Good morning,\" Mrs. Morton, the lady thus addressed,<br />\nran to her and, throwing her arms around her,<br />\ncried, \"Oh! Annie! isn't it awful! poor, poor<br />\nHarry!\"<br />\nMrs. Gaylord managed to free herself from<br />\nthe embrace in which she was held and said,<br />\n\"Mrs. Morton, Harry is not dead; he is alive,<br />\nand perfectly well.\"<br />\n\"Oh, Annie has lost her mind!\" exclaimed<br />\nMrs. Morton burying her face in her handkerchief. \"I knew she could never bear the<br />\nshock!\"<br />\nStill bemoaning the sad state of her friend,<br />\nMrs. Morton went into the parlor, where in a<br />\nplain black casket lay, not handsome Harry<br />\nGaylord, but an aged man whose wrinkled<br />\nface and toil-worn hands showed many years<br />\nof combat with the world.<br />\nThe mystery was easily explained. About<br />\n<br />\na month before Mr. Gaylord, Harry's father,<br />\nhad accidentally met the man who years ago<br />\nhad given him his first start in business, but<br />\nwho from a series of misfortunes, was at that<br />\ntime friendless, and in destitute circumstances.<br />\nMr. Gaylord cordially received him into his<br />\nhome, where, as the paper correctly stated, he<br />\nhad died suddenly the night preceding the<br />\nday of which we write. His name being<br />\nHenry Gale, the mistake was not surprising.<br />\nHarry had almost lost sight of his last<br />\nnight's troubles in the novelty of attending<br />\nhis own funeral, or something very like it.<br />\nSomeone suggested that he make his appearance upon the scene, and so convince his<br />\nfriends that he was not dead; but the first<br />\ntime this was tried one lady fainted and such<br />\na panic followed that Harry saying he would<br />\nrather play dead man than spook, discreetly<br />\nkept himself out of sight for the remainder of<br />\nthe day. Mr. and Mrs. Gaylord were overwhelmed with messages of condolence, while<br />\nfriends and relatives continued to flock in<br />\nwith their offerings of flowers, and words of<br />\npraise for \"poor Harry,\" until with explaining and convincing the members of the Gaylord family were completely worn out.<br />\nAt last the ludicrous side of the situation<br />\nbecame too much for Harry, and finding himself no longer able to mantain the gravity<br />\nwhich the occasion required, he escaped from<br />\nhis uninvited visitors and went to the home<br />\nof his uncle a few squares away, where, as he<br />\nexpressed it, he \"could have his laugh out in<br />\npeace.\"<br />\nWith an appreciation of quiet which he had<br />\nnever known before, Harry was sitting in the<br />\ntwilight talking over the events of the day<br />\nwith his uncle and aunt, when there was a<br />\nviolent ring of the door bell, and in an other<br />\nmoment Elizabeth Winter rushed in and threw<br />\nherself in Mrs. Gaylord's arms.<br />\nThe lady whom Harry's uncle had married<br />\nwas a distant relative and warm friend of<br />\nElizabeth, and to her, after a day of intense<br />\nagony and self-accusation, the girl had determined to come.<br />\nIn the half light of the room Elizabeth had<br />\nnot seen Harry, whose heart thrilled as he<br />\nhad heard her exclaim.<br />\n\"Oh, Ethel ! he is dead, and it is all my<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nfault ! he was so good and noble and I did<br />\neverything to tease and worry him.\"<br />\nSeeing that Elizabeth's nerves were in a<br />\nstate of dangerously high tension, Ethel Gaylord, with true womanly tact, drew her down<br />\non the sofa beside her, and gently though, at<br />\nfirst very gradually, unraveled for her the<br />\ntangled web of circumstances in which hetpoor little heart had been held thro' all that<br />\nlong dreary day.<br />\nAs the full meaning of what she had heard<br />\ndawned upon her Elizabeth sat perfectly quiet<br />\nfor a few minutes, and then without raising<br />\nher head from Ethel's shoulder said:<br />\n\"Ethel dear, I know you are telling me the<br />\ntruth, but I can't make myself believe it until<br />\nI really see him.\"<br />\n\"Then you shall be convinced in your own<br />\nway,\" Ethel replied, and Elizabeth looked up<br />\nto find Harry standing before her with outstretched hands. Not a word passed between<br />\nthe two, but their long warm hand clasp left<br />\nno need of words.<br />\nA short time later Elizabeth Winter again<br />\nstood upon the door step of her own home,<br />\nwatching the retreating figure of Harry Gaylord as she had done twenty-four hours before.<br />\nThis time, however, he looked back several<br />\ntimes before he disappeared from view, and<br />\nsmiled as he saw the white-robed girl still<br />\nstanding there. And again Elizabeth recalled<br />\nthe look in Harry's brown eyes as he bade her<br />\ngood-night, but this time it was full of unspeakable happiness that the very memory<br />\nseemed to vibrate within her heart, and blending with the joy that dwelt there made<br />\nsweetest music for her all the night.\u2014M.E.H.<br />\n<br />\nA TOUCH OF NATURE.<br />\nThe editor sat in his big office chair,<br />\nThe waste-basket sat on the floor;<br />\nThe one with a sense of importance was filled,<br />\nThe other with papers galore.<br />\nThe papers\u2014if ignorance leads you to doubt,<br />\nThat ignorance never proclaim\u2014<br />\nResented their treatment, and highly incensed,<br />\nDeclared that 'twas really a shame.<br />\nThey rattled and rustled at such a wild rate,<br />\nThat the editor rose from his chair,<br />\nAnd lowered a window; the noise, he inferred,<br />\nWas cause by a current of air.<br />\nThat one touch of nature the whole world<br />\nmakes kin<br />\nHas by sages and saints been found true,<br />\nAnd here events proved that the same rule<br />\napplies,<br />\nTo worlds and waste-baskets too.<br />\nThese papers, together in such a sad plight,<br />\nLet their anger to sympathy sink;<br />\nEach quelled its own rage, and in true<br />\nChristian way,<br />\nBegan of its neighbor to think.<br />\nA dear little maiden's effusion on \"Spring\"<br />\nAnd a rural swain's heart-broken lay<br />\nSoon found that their pages had gotten mixed<br />\nIn a most unaccountable way.<br />\n<br />\nHere are some samples of a modern advertisement for new musical compositions:<br />\n\"Come Where My Love Lies Dreaming\"<br />\n(with illuminated cover.)<br />\n\"Trust Her Not\" (for so cents.)<br />\n\"I Would Not Live Always\" (without<br />\naccompaniment.)<br />\n\"See. the Conquering Hero Comes\" (with<br />\nfull orchestra.)<br />\n\"Whe the Sun Shall Set No More\" (in C).<br />\n\"The Tale of the Swordfish\" (with many<br />\nscales.)<br />\n\"After the Ball\" (for second base.)<br />\n\"Home, Sweet Home\" (in A flat.)<br />\n\u2014Exchange.<br />\n<br />\nA bachelor's ode on \"The Sorrows of Life\"<br />\nAnd a spinster's sad lines upon \"Time\"<br />\nDiscovered themselves to be strangely alike,<br />\nIn substance and meter and rhyme.<br />\n\"Good Cooking\" and Hygeine,quite naturally<br />\nmet\u2014<br />\nThen, when each had a partner obtained,<br />\nAll cheerfully chatted, forgotting their ire,<br />\nAnd content in the waste-basket reigned.<br />\nM.

Hopkins must realize<br />\nhow much they loose by the graduation of the class of 1907. As<br />\nundergraduates they have done much for the University; as gradv is le<br />\nuates, \"Medies\" and Alumni they are able, if they will, to do even<br />\nmore.

The first nUmber of the volume was published while<br />\nLittle Ross street was echoing with the squeals of the infant class of<br />\n1909; this final number will come into the hands of its readers after<br />\nthe new freshmen have received their first lessons in the art of conducting themselves properly.<br />\nThe NEWS-LETTER has partaken in the joys and sorrows of the<br />\npast year at Hopkins. The not over-brilliant showing made by the<br />\nFootball team last fall has been more than offset by the splendid work<br />\nof the Lacrosse team this spring, the defeat (which by the way was<br />\nnearly a victory) at the Annapolis meet was atoned for by the victory over Virginia.

It was this it was not hard for him to become pessimistic.<br />\nexpression which first told her what her \"After all,\" he thought, \"what reason have I<br />\nthoughtlessness had done,and, as she recalled to think she cares for me.

The thought that she<br />\nthan two years, and, tho' the friendship which could atone for her folly when she next saw<br />\nhad existed between them from the beginning Harry seemed to bring little comfort. Next<br />\nof their acquaintance had been very pleasant time seemed so vague and far-off. When she<br />\nand matter-of-fact, her woman's intuition had awoke, after a few hours of troubled sleep, it<br />\ntold her sometime since that she was becom- was with a dull sense of present or impending<br />\ning more to him than could be expressed in calamity. She dressed and went down to the<br />\nthe word \"friend.\" She did not question her breakfast-room, but none of the other memown heart, but was quite content to let mat- bers of the family had yet made their appearters rest as they were. She acknowledged the ance. The morning paper lay beside her<br />\ncongeniality between him and herself and father's plate, and, as she picked it up and<br />\nrecognized the full value of the sterling glanced carelessly over it, her eye fell upon<br />\nqualities which he possessed, but her heart the following notice: Died\u2014\"Of heart-failure,<br />\nwas in no hurry to own the master, and she on July 20th, Henry Gaylord at 362 Nelson<br />\nchatted and danced with other men, often Street.\"<br />\nfinding compensation for the lack of pleasure<br />\nPutting the paper back in its place she<br />\nwhich she found in their company in her returned to her room, hardly comprehending<br />\nmischievous enjoyment of the look of annoy- the meaning of what she had read. There<br />\nance on Harry's face.<br />\ncould be no doubt about it\u2014\"Henry Gaylord<br />\nOn the evening in question there had been at 362 Nelson Street;\" his name was probably<br />\nsomething in Harry Gaylord's manner when Henry, altho she had always kuown him as<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHarry, and the address given was certainly<br />\nhis. Then like a flash she remembered how,<br />\non the preceding evening, he had suddenly<br />\nturned pale and stopped in the middle of a<br />\nsentence, but had assured her that it was only<br />\na sharp pain around the heart which the<br />\nDoctor said was nothing serious\u2014and now,<br />\nhe was gone ! gone, before she could tell him<br />\nhow sorry she was, yes, and something else,<br />\ntoo, which she had just discovered herself<br />\nnow that he was gone forever.<br />\nSo the day dragged on, Elizabeth scarcely<br />\nknew how. She pleaded headache\u2014which<br />\nwas certainly no idle excuse\u2014and shut herself up with the three great facts of her life:<br />\nthat she loved Harry Gaylord with all the<br />\nstrength of her being, that she had done him<br />\na great wrong, and that he was gone !<br />\nIn the meantime 362 Nelson Street was the<br />\nscene of what might be termed a tragic<br />\ncomedy. The crape on the door showed that<br />\ndeath had set its seal there, while there was<br />\nthe coming and going and profusion of<br />\nflowers that mark such occasions, yet there<br />\nwas something in the expression of those who<br />\ncame out of the house that would have puzzled an observer.<br />\nA lady, dressed in black and carrying a<br />\nbunch of ferns and roses, ascended the steps<br />\nand entered the hall. Strangely enough Mrs.<br />\nGaylord was there, and though she wore deep<br />\nback, one could almost imagine that she<br />\nsmiled. Not noticing her quiet Good morning,\" Mrs. Morton, the lady thus addressed,<br />\nran to her and, throwing her arms around her,<br />\ncried, \"Oh! Annie! isn't it awful! poor, poor<br />\nHarry!\"<br />\nMrs. Gaylord managed to free herself from<br />\nthe embrace in which she was held and said,<br />\n\"Mrs. Morton, Harry is not dead; he is alive,<br />\nand perfectly well.\"<br />\n\"Oh, Annie has lost her mind!\" exclaimed<br />\nMrs. Morton burying her face in her handkerchief. \"I knew she could never bear the<br />\nshock!\"<br />\nStill bemoaning the sad state of her friend,<br />\nMrs. Morton went into the parlor, where in a<br />\nplain black casket lay, not handsome Harry<br />\nGaylord, but an aged man whose wrinkled<br />\nface and toil-worn hands showed many years<br />\nof combat with the world.<br />\nThe mystery was easily explained. About<br /><br />\na month before Mr. Gaylord, Harry's father,<br />\nhad accidentally met the man who years ago<br />\nhad given him his first start in business, but<br />\nwho from a series of misfortunes, was at that<br />\ntime friendless, and in destitute circumstances.<br />\nMr. Gaylord cordially received him into his<br />\nhome, where, as the paper correctly stated, he<br />\nhad died suddenly the night preceding the<br />\nday of which we write. His name being<br />\nHenry Gale, the mistake was not surprising.<br />\nHarry had almost lost sight of his last<br />\nnight's troubles in the novelty of attending<br />\nhis own funeral, or something very like it.<br />\nSomeone suggested that he make his appearance upon the scene, and so convince his<br />\nfriends that he was not dead; but the first<br />\ntime this was tried one lady fainted and such<br />\na panic followed that Harry saying he would<br />\nrather play dead man than spook, discreetly<br />\nkept himself out of sight for the remainder of<br />\nthe day. Mr. and Mrs. Gaylord were overwhelmed with messages of condolence, while<br />\nfriends and relatives continued to flock in<br />\nwith their offerings of flowers, and words of<br />\npraise for \"poor Harry,\" until with explaining and convincing the members of the Gaylord family were completely worn out.<br />\nAt last the ludicrous side of the situation<br />\nbecame too much for Harry, and finding himself no longer able to mantain the gravity<br />\nwhich the occasion required, he escaped from<br />\nhis uninvited visitors and went to the home<br />\nof his uncle a few squares away, where, as he<br />\nexpressed it, he \"could have his laugh out in<br />\npeace.\"<br />\nWith an appreciation of quiet which he had<br />\nnever known before, Harry was sitting in the<br />\ntwilight talking over the events of the day<br />\nwith his uncle and aunt, when there was a<br />\nviolent ring of the door bell, and in an other<br />\nmoment Elizabeth Winter rushed in and threw<br />\nherself in Mrs. Gaylord's arms.<br />\nThe lady whom Harry's uncle had married<br />\nwas a distant relative and warm friend of<br />\nElizabeth, and to her, after a day of intense<br />\nagony and self-accusation, the girl had determined to come.<br />\nIn the half light of the room Elizabeth had<br />\nnot seen Harry, whose heart thrilled as he<br />\nhad heard her exclaim.<br />\n\"Oh, Ethel ! he is dead, and it is all my<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nfault ! he was so good and noble and I did<br />\neverything to tease and worry him.\"<br />\nSeeing that Elizabeth's nerves were in a<br />\nstate of dangerously high tension, Ethel Gaylord, with true womanly tact, drew her down<br />\non the sofa beside her, and gently though, at<br />\nfirst very gradually, unraveled for her the<br />\ntangled web of circumstances in which hetpoor little heart had been held thro' all that<br />\nlong dreary day.<br />\nAs the full meaning of what she had heard<br />\ndawned upon her Elizabeth sat perfectly quiet<br />\nfor a few minutes, and then without raising<br />\nher head from Ethel's shoulder said:<br />\n\"Ethel dear, I know you are telling me the<br />\ntruth, but I can't make myself believe it until<br />\nI really see him.\"<br />\n\"Then you shall be convinced in your own<br />\nway,\" Ethel replied, and Elizabeth looked up<br />\nto find Harry standing before her with outstretched hands. Not a word passed between<br />\nthe two, but their long warm hand clasp left<br />\nno need of words.<br />\nA short time later Elizabeth Winter again<br />\nstood upon the door step of her own home,<br />\nwatching the retreating figure of Harry Gaylord as she had done twenty-four hours before.<br />\nThis time, however, he looked back several<br />\ntimes before he disappeared from view, and<br />\nsmiled as he saw the white-robed girl still<br />\nstanding there. And again Elizabeth recalled<br />\nthe look in Harry's brown eyes as he bade her<br />\ngood-night, but this time it was full of unspeakable happiness that the very memory<br />\nseemed to vibrate within her heart, and blending with the joy that dwelt there made<br />\nsweetest music for her all the night.\u2014M.E.H.<br /><br />\nA TOUCH OF NATURE.<br />\nThe editor sat in his big office chair,<br />\nThe waste-basket sat on the floor;<br />\nThe one with a sense of importance was filled,<br />\nThe other with papers galore.<br />\nThe papers\u2014if ignorance leads you to doubt,<br />\nThat ignorance never proclaim\u2014<br />\nResented their treatment, and highly incensed,<br />\nDeclared that 'twas really a shame.<br />\nThey rattled and rustled at such a wild rate,<br />\nThat the editor rose from his chair,<br />\nAnd lowered a window; the noise, he inferred,<br />\nWas cause by a current of air.<br />\nThat one touch of nature the whole world<br />\nmakes kin<br />\nHas by sages and saints been found true,<br />\nAnd here events proved that the same rule<br />\napplies,<br />\nTo worlds and waste-baskets too.<br />\nThese papers, together in such a sad plight,<br />\nLet their anger to sympathy sink;<br />\nEach quelled its own rage, and in true<br />\nChristian way,<br />\nBegan of its neighbor to think.<br />\nA dear little maiden's effusion on \"Spring\"<br />\nAnd a rural swain's heart-broken lay<br />\nSoon found that their pages had gotten mixed<br />\nIn a most unaccountable way.<br /><br />\nHere are some samples of a modern advertisement for new musical compositions:<br />\n\"Come Where My Love Lies Dreaming\"<br />\n(with illuminated cover.)<br />\n\"Trust Her Not\" (for so cents.)<br />\n\"I Would Not Live Always\" (without<br />\naccompaniment.)<br />\n\"See. the Conquering Hero Comes\" (with<br />\nfull orchestra.)<br />\n\"Whe the Sun Shall Set No More\" (in C).<br />\n\"The Tale of the Swordfish\" (with many<br />\nscales.)<br />\n\"After the Ball\" (for second base.)<br />\n\"Home, Sweet Home\" (in A flat.)<br />\n\u2014Exchange.<br /><br />\nA bachelor's ode on \"The Sorrows of Life\"<br />\nAnd a spinster's sad lines upon \"Time\"<br />\nDiscovered themselves to be strangely alike,<br />\nIn substance and meter and rhyme.<br />\n\"Good Cooking\" and Hygeine,quite naturally<br />\nmet\u2014<br />\nThen, when each had a partner obtained,<br />\nAll cheerfully chatted, forgotting their ire,<br />\nAnd content in the waste-basket reigned.<br />\nM.
