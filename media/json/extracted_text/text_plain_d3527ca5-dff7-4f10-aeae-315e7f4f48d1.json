XVIII, NO. 29.<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JUNE 1, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\nNEW INTERFRAT. AGREEMENT<br />\n<br />\nMORGAN WON TOURNAMENT<br />\nBut Tennis Star Had to Play Hard to<br />\nBeat Crawford\u2014Season Closed<br />\nin a Blaze of Glory.<br />\n<br />\nThe tennis schedule was concluded last week in a blaze of<br />\nglory. The tournament was finally<br />\ncompleted, and the team played the<br />\nlast matches of its schedule.<br />\nThe final round in the championship singles, in which Morgan and<br />\nCrawford were the contenders,<br />\nbrought out some sterling play.<br />\nMorgan, who has not be defeated<br />\nin any college match this spring,<br />\nwas naturally expected to win, but<br />\nit required some sterling play to<br />\ncome through on top. Crawford<br />\nbegan with a rush and took the<br />\nfirst two sets, 6-4, 7-5. Here, however, Morgan's experience a n d<br />\npowers of endurance stood him in<br />\ngood stead. He made his opponent<br />\nplay his hardest, and the pace<br />\nproved too strong. Morgan won<br />\nthe next three sets and the match,<br />\n6-4, 6-3, 6-2.<br />\nThe consolations were completed<br />\nabout two weeks ago and brought<br />\nout some surprises. In the semifinal round, Evitt, who is a beginner at the game, disposed of Powers, the winner in last year's consolations. However, he was forced<br />\nto bow to Merrick in the final<br />\nround, after four hotly-contested<br />\nsets. The finals in the doubles were<br />\nnot so exciting, as the outcome was<br />\na foregone conclusion. Morgan<br />\nand Crawford easily defeated Huck<br />\nand Beatty in straight sets.<br />\nBy defeating Swarthmore on last<br />\nTuesday by five matches to one the<br />\nHopkins team closed an exceedingly successful season. Out of nine<br />\nmaches, five were won, two tied and<br />\nonly two lost. The schedule was<br />\neasily the most ambitious ever attempted. Michigan, by the rather<br />\nfoxy trick of pitting its weakest<br />\nman against Morgan, managed to<br />\nearn a draw, each team getting two<br />\nsingles and one doubles match. On<br />\nthe day following the HopkinsMichigan play, Gettysburg was met<br />\non the Homewood courts and defeated by the score of 4 to 2. The<br />\nlast match of the season, that with<br />\nSwarthmore, was a walk-away for<br />\nHopkins. Morgan beat Gittings,<br />\n6-2, 6-0; Crawford beat the Swarthmore captain, 6-2, 6-4; DuBray defeated Sproul, 9-7, o-6, 6-3; and<br />\nHammond won from Gittings, 6-4,<br />\n6-1. The only match won by<br />\nSwarthmore was the doubles, in<br />\nwhich Hammond and Corner were<br />\ndefeated, 6-4, 6-4. The Swarthmore team was dined at Roland<br />\nPark and returned home the same<br />\nevc fling.<br />\n.i'hough the tennis team will be<br />\nco isiderably weakened by the grad-<br />\n<br />\nSCHEDULE OF FESTIVITIES FOR SENIOR WEEK<br />\nJune 4\u2014Senior Prom,9 P.

Hulburt,<br />\ngraduate in mathematics and physics and former lacrosse star, to<br />\nselect perhaps the most novel and<br />\ninteresting summer employment yet<br />\nheard of around the University.<br />\nHulburt has received the position<br />\nof official calculator on the yacht<br />\nVanitie, one of the three swift sailing vessels which will compete for<br />\nthe honor of defending the International Yacht Cup against Sir<br />\nThomas Lipton's newest challenger,<br />\nShamrock IV. Hulburt will leave<br />\nBaltimore to take up his duties on<br />\nJune 6. His special work will be<br />\nthe keeping of all the official records of the Vanitie, the reading of<br />\nthe speedometer, the tilt, the heel<br />\nand the wind pressure, and the<br />\ncomputation of the speed attained<br />\nunder different atmospheric conditions. The trials will consist of<br />\ndaily trips on Long Island Sound.<br />\nIn addition, a series of regattas<br />\nwill be held during the summer at<br />\nNewport, and upon the results<br />\nmade in these by the three contenders will depend the choice of<br />\nthe American cup defender. If the<br />\nVanitie is chosen to compete against<br />\nthe foreigner, Hulburt will remain<br />\naboard during the international<br />\nrace, which will take place in September. By that time the Hopkins<br />\nman will have become thoroughly<br />\nhardened to ocean life and, with his<br />\nthorough mathematical training,<br />\nshould prove a valuable addition to<br />\nthe crew of the yacht.<br />\n<br />\nThe executive board of the General Athletic Association held its last<br />\nmeeting of the year on Wednesday<br />\nin the Trophy Room to award honorary letters to members and managers<br />\nof the three spring teams. Thirtythree members of the lacrosse, track<br />\nand baseball squads received the\"H,\"<br />\nand fourteen others the \"H. A. A.\"<br />\nRoger Howell, Andrew Hilgartner<br />\nand George E. Dorsey, managers<br />\nof the lacrosse, baseball and track<br />\nteams, respectively, were awarded<br />\nthe \"H. M.\"<br />\nThe letters and sweaters will not<br />\nbe given to the successful students<br />\nuntil the annual spring blow-out<br />\nand bonfire, which will be held at<br />\nHomewood shortly after the conclusion of the final examinations.<br />\nPlans for the celebration are in<br />\nthe hands of a special committee.<br />\nCaptains and coaches will make<br />\nspeeches and ice cream and cake<br />\nwill be served.<br />\nAfter the awarding of the letters<br />\nby the Athletic Board, important<br />\nelections were held. George E.<br />\nDorsey, of the graduating class,<br />\nwas elected graduate manager for<br />\nthe coming season, to succeed Paul<br />\n0. Carter. Dorsey has been interested in athletics ever since his<br />\nentrance into the University, and<br />\nfilled the position of assistant manager of the track team in 1913-14<br />\nand that of manager during the past<br />\nyear.<br />\nEverard Deems, '15, who has<br />\nbeen assistant manager of the track<br />\nteam for two years, was unanimously elected as manager of the<br />\nteam. Deems, is thoroughly familiar<br />\nwith track and field athletics and<br />\nwill make an able successor to the<br />\nnew graduate manager.<br />\nRoger Howell's place as manager of the lacrosse team will be<br />\nfilled next year by Hiram Woodward, '16, who has been assistant<br />\nmanager of the team for two years<br />\nand has also played on the scrub lacrosse team.<br />\n<br />\nuation of DuBray and Crawford<br />\nfrom the Medical School and of<br />\nHammond and Corner from the<br />\nundegraduate department, there<br />\nstill remains much good material at<br />\nthe University.<br />\n<br />\nCommittee Now Drawing Up New Code.<br />\nWill Have No Definite Time for<br />\nthe \"Rushing Season.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe Interfraternity Agreement,<br />\nrecently threatened with dissolution<br />\nbecause of differences of opinion<br />\namong the various chapters in the<br />\nUniversity, has been agreed to by<br />\nall fraternities but one (Delta Phi),<br />\nwhich is not at present favorable to<br />\nany rules governing the \"rushing\"<br />\nof freshmen. Thus it will be finally ratified at a meeting of the Board<br />\nsome time this week. The work of<br />\nthe wording and drawing up of the<br />\nagreement is in the hands of a committee, which is now at work.<br />\nThe new set of \"rushing rules\"<br />\nwill differ materially from those of<br />\nthe two previous years. There will<br />\nbe no definite \"rushing season.\" In<br />\nthe place of this there is to be substituted a period of time (from the<br />\nbeginning of the college year until.<br />\nthe second Monday after the Y. M..<br />\nC. A. reception) in which no freshman may be taken into a fraternity<br />\nhouse or talked to on fraternity<br />\nmatters; in other words, a closed<br />\nseason for freshmen, during which<br />\nthey are supposed to be getting<br />\nsettled and looking around for<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nThe penalties for violation of the<br />\nagreement will probably remain the<br />\nsame. At present they are considered severe by some, and act as<br />\na sure safeguard against infringment by the separate chapters.<br />\nThe discussions of the interfraternity rules during the last few<br />\nmonths has been keen 'at times and<br />\nit looked once as if the whole business would explode and all chapters<br />\nreturn to the entertainment and<br />\npledging of high school boys\u2014a<br />\ncustom somewhat unwise and inexpedient.<br />\nEach fraternity stood out for a<br />\ndifferent system of \"rushing,\" but<br />\nfinally a compromise was hit upon<br />\nwhich would meet the concessions<br />\nof both the conservative and the<br />\nprogressive elements. This once<br />\ndone, the settlement of the matter<br />\nwas quick.<br />\nThe Board expects to have the<br />\nnew set of rules printed in time for<br />\ndistribution among the various nearby prep. schools, and to distribute<br />\nthem among the incoming freshman class next fall.<br />\nThe agreement has been in existence three years and has been radically changed each year. At last it<br />\nseems that a sensible plan, and one<br />\nwhich is well suited to the needs of<br />\nHopkins, has been evolved and the<br />\nnew rules are likely ,to remain in<br />\nforce for some time.<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, JUNE 1, 1914.<br />\n<br />\nALEXANDER K.

AGREEMENT<br /><br />\nMORGAN WON TOURNAMENT<br />\nBut Tennis Star Had to Play Hard to<br />\nBeat Crawford\u2014Season Closed<br />\nin a Blaze of Glory.<br /><br />\nThe tennis schedule was concluded last week in a blaze of<br />\nglory. The tournament was finally<br />\ncompleted, and the team played the<br />\nlast matches of its schedule.<br />\nThe final round in the championship singles, in which Morgan and<br />\nCrawford were the contenders,<br />\nbrought out some sterling play.<br />\nMorgan, who has not be defeated<br />\nin any college match this spring,<br />\nwas naturally expected to win, but<br />\nit required some sterling play to<br />\ncome through on top. Crawford<br />\nbegan with a rush and took the<br />\nfirst two sets, 6-4, 7-5. Here, however, Morgan's experience a n d<br />\npowers of endurance stood him in<br />\ngood stead. He made his opponent<br />\nplay his hardest, and the pace<br />\nproved too strong. Morgan won<br />\nthe next three sets and the match,<br />\n6-4, 6-3, 6-2.<br />\nThe consolations were completed<br />\nabout two weeks ago and brought<br />\nout some surprises. In the semifinal round, Evitt, who is a beginner at the game, disposed of Powers, the winner in last year's consolations. However, he was forced<br />\nto bow to Merrick in the final<br />\nround, after four hotly-contested<br />\nsets. The finals in the doubles were<br />\nnot so exciting, as the outcome was<br />\na foregone conclusion. Morgan<br />\nand Crawford easily defeated Huck<br />\nand Beatty in straight sets.<br />\nBy defeating Swarthmore on last<br />\nTuesday by five matches to one the<br />\nHopkins team closed an exceedingly successful season. Out of nine<br />\nmaches, five were won, two tied and<br />\nonly two lost. The schedule was<br />\neasily the most ambitious ever attempted. Michigan, by the rather<br />\nfoxy trick of pitting its weakest<br />\nman against Morgan, managed to<br />\nearn a draw, each team getting two<br />\nsingles and one doubles match. On<br />\nthe day following the HopkinsMichigan play, Gettysburg was met<br />\non the Homewood courts and defeated by the score of 4 to 2. The<br />\nlast match of the season, that with<br />\nSwarthmore, was a walk-away for<br />\nHopkins. Morgan beat Gittings,<br />\n6-2, 6-0; Crawford beat the Swarthmore captain, 6-2, 6-4; DuBray defeated Sproul, 9-7, o-6, 6-3; and<br />\nHammond won from Gittings, 6-4,<br />\n6-1. The only match won by<br />\nSwarthmore was the doubles, in<br />\nwhich Hammond and Corner were<br />\ndefeated, 6-4, 6-4.

Hulburt,<br />\ngraduate in mathematics and physics and former lacrosse star, to<br />\nselect perhaps the most novel and<br />\ninteresting summer employment yet<br />\nheard of around the University.<br />\nHulburt has received the position<br />\nof official calculator on the yacht<br />\nVanitie, one of the three swift sailing vessels which will compete for<br />\nthe honor of defending the International Yacht Cup against Sir<br />\nThomas Lipton's newest challenger,<br />\nShamrock IV. Hulburt will leave<br />\nBaltimore to take up his duties on<br />\nJune 6. His special work will be<br />\nthe keeping of all the official records of the Vanitie, the reading of<br />\nthe speedometer, the tilt, the heel<br />\nand the wind pressure, and the<br />\ncomputation of the speed attained<br />\nunder different atmospheric conditions. The trials will consist of<br />\ndaily trips on Long Island Sound.<br />\nIn addition, a series of regattas<br />\nwill be held during the summer at<br />\nNewport, and upon the results<br />\nmade in these by the three contenders will depend the choice of<br />\nthe American cup defender. If the<br />\nVanitie is chosen to compete against<br />\nthe foreigner, Hulburt will remain<br />\naboard during the international<br />\nrace, which will take place in September. By that time the Hopkins<br />\nman will have become thoroughly<br />\nhardened to ocean life and, with his<br />\nthorough mathematical training,<br />\nshould prove a valuable addition to<br />\nthe crew of the yacht.<br /><br />\nThe executive board of the General Athletic Association held its last<br />\nmeeting of the year on Wednesday<br />\nin the Trophy Room to award honorary letters to members and managers<br />\nof the three spring teams. Thirtythree members of the lacrosse, track<br />\nand baseball squads received the\"H,\"<br />\nand fourteen others the \"H. A. A.\"<br />\nRoger Howell, Andrew Hilgartner<br />\nand George E. Dorsey, managers<br />\nof the lacrosse, baseball and track<br />\nteams, respectively, were awarded<br />\nthe \"H. M.\"<br />\nThe letters and sweaters will not<br />\nbe given to the successful students<br />\nuntil the annual spring blow-out<br />\nand bonfire, which will be held at<br />\nHomewood shortly after the conclusion of the final examinations.<br />\nPlans for the celebration are in<br />\nthe hands of a special committee.<br />\nCaptains and coaches will make<br />\nspeeches and ice cream and cake<br />\nwill be served.<br />\nAfter the awarding of the letters<br />\nby the Athletic Board, important<br />\nelections were held. George E.<br />\nDorsey, of the graduating class,<br />\nwas elected graduate manager for<br />\nthe coming season, to succeed Paul<br />\n0. Carter. Dorsey has been interested in athletics ever since his<br />\nentrance into the University, and<br />\nfilled the position of assistant manager of the track team in 1913-14<br />\nand that of manager during the past<br />\nyear.<br />\nEverard Deems, '15, who has<br />\nbeen assistant manager of the track<br />\nteam for two years, was unanimously elected as manager of the<br />\nteam. Deems, is thoroughly familiar<br />\nwith track and field athletics and<br />\nwill make an able successor to the<br />\nnew graduate manager.<br />\nRoger Howell's place as manager of the lacrosse team will be<br />\nfilled next year by Hiram Woodward, '16, who has been assistant<br />\nmanager of the team for two years<br />\nand has also played on the scrub lacrosse team.<br /><br />\nuation of DuBray and Crawford<br />\nfrom the Medical School and of<br />\nHammond and Corner from the<br />\nundegraduate department, there<br />\nstill remains much good material at<br />\nthe University.<br /><br />\nCommittee Now Drawing Up New Code.<br />\nWill Have No Definite Time for<br />\nthe \"Rushing Season.\"<br /><br />\nThe Interfraternity Agreement,<br />\nrecently threatened with dissolution<br />\nbecause of differences of opinion<br />\namong the various chapters in the<br />\nUniversity, has been agreed to by<br />\nall fraternities but one (Delta Phi),<br />\nwhich is not at present favorable to<br />\nany rules governing the \"rushing\"<br />\nof freshmen. Thus it will be finally ratified at a meeting of the Board<br />\nsome time this week. The work of<br />\nthe wording and drawing up of the<br />\nagreement is in the hands of a committee, which is now at work.<br />\nThe new set of \"rushing rules\"<br />\nwill differ materially from those of<br />\nthe two previous years. There will<br />\nbe no definite \"rushing season.\" In<br />\nthe place of this there is to be substituted a period of time (from the<br />\nbeginning of the college year until.<br />\nthe second Monday after the Y. M..<br />\nC. A. reception) in which no freshman may be taken into a fraternity<br />\nhouse or talked to on fraternity<br />\nmatters; in other words, a closed<br />\nseason for freshmen, during which<br />\nthey are supposed to be getting<br />\nsettled and looking around for<br />\nthemselves.<br />\nThe penalties for violation of the<br />\nagreement will probably remain the<br />\nsame. At present they are considered severe by some, and act as<br />\na sure safeguard against infringment by the separate chapters.<br />\nThe discussions of the interfraternity rules during the last few<br />\nmonths has been keen 'at times and<br />\nit looked once as if the whole business would explode and all chapters<br />\nreturn to the entertainment and<br />\npledging of high school boys\u2014a<br />\ncustom somewhat unwise and inexpedient.<br />\nEach fraternity stood out for a<br />\ndifferent system of \"rushing,\" but<br />\nfinally a compromise was hit upon<br />\nwhich would meet the concessions<br />\nof both the conservative and the<br />\nprogressive elements. This once<br />\ndone, the settlement of the matter<br />\nwas quick.<br />\nThe Board expects to have the<br />\nnew set of rules printed in time for<br />\ndistribution among the various nearby prep. schools, and to distribute<br />\nthem among the incoming freshman class next fall.<br />\nThe agreement has been in existence three years and has been radically changed each year. At last it<br />\nseems that a sensible plan, and one<br />\nwhich is well suited to the needs of<br />\nHopkins, has been evolved and the<br />\nnew rules are likely ,to remain in<br />\nforce for some time.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER, JUNE 1, 1914.<br /><br />\nALEXANDER K.
