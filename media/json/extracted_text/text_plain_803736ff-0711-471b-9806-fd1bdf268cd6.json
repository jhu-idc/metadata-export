The score was<br />\n7 to 6.<br />\nJack Defandorf, who was on the<br />\nmound for Hopkins, pitched a<br />\nsplendid game with the exception of<br />\nthe two innings\u2014the third and the<br />\nninth\u2014in which four runs were<br />\nscored. Hoch, Delaware's pitcher,<br />\nstruck out ten men, and from the<br />\nthird to the ninth inning allowed no<br />\nhits, but Hopkins' heavy hitting<br />\nlead-off men found him in the ninth<br />\nand eleventh periods for enough<br />\nhits to break the even score.<br />\nBill Noble, desperate and hungry<br />\n(for it was nearly six o'clock), told<br />\nhis teammates on the bench just before he went to bat in the eleventh<br />\ninning that he was due for a long<br />\nhit. He poled out a beautiful triple<br />\nto center, and scored on Sutton's<br />\nsacrifice fly, thus winning the fourth<br />\nconsecutive game for the Black and<br />\nBlue.<br />\nThe battle was certainly thrilling.<br />\nHopkins got 'a lead of three runs<br />\nover Delaware in the third inning,<br />\nbut the Blue and Gray evened the<br />\nscore in the fifth. Then came the<br />\nstruggle to break the deadlock. Hopkins scored twice in the ninth, but<br />\nDelaware evened un in its portion<br />\nof the inning. The tenth period<br />\nlasted fifteen minutes.<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter, the first to bat<br />\nfor Hopkins, sent a liner to first<br />\nbase, but Geoghegan fielded it in<br />\nbig-league style. Then Bill Noble<br />\ndrove out his triple. Inasmuch as it<br />\nwas a question of getting only one<br />\nrun to win, Butts Sutton concluded<br />\nthat it would do to send out a fly<br />\nlong enough to allow Noble to<br />\nscore. This he did. Delaware went<br />\nout in one-two-three order in its<br />\nend of the inning.<br />\nOne of the results of the game<br />\nwas the establishment of the fact<br />\nthat Coach Eddie Hooper hasn't<br />\nheart failure. \"After this game,\"<br />\nhe said, \"no doctor can ever tell me<br />\nI have heart failure. If I had it<br />\nI would have been dead before the<br />\nninth inning.\"<br />\nWhen the game was over the<br />\nplayers had just enough time to<br />\ndress to catch the 6.13 train for<br />\nBaltimore.

There<br />\nare a large number of candidates<br />\nout for the team, two or three men<br />\ncontesting for every position. The<br />\nlist of available pitchers is especially<br />\nlong.

Lehigh's<br />\ntactics, however, proved to be less<br />\nefficient than those of the characteristically well-drilled Black and Blue<br />\nsquad; and, although it had a distinct advantage in weight, the<br />\nBrown and White team was unable<br />\nto cope successfully with the rapidfire work of the Hopkins attack.<br />\nA closer game has not been seen<br />\nat Homewood in many years.

As a result of over-zealous<br />\nstickwork on the part of some players, several minor injuries were sustained by players, and at the end of<br />\nthe second half there were few out<br />\nof the twenty-four that left the field<br />\nwho were not stiff and sore from<br />\nrepeated knocks and falls.<br />\nThe work of Captain Troxell,<br />\nLeibensperger, Boyce and Stuart<br />\nwas most prominent in keeping the<br />\nheavy South Bethlehemites from<br />\ntaking the championship.

He showed how indelibly the marks of Dutch national<br />\nhistory are stamped upon its literature.<br />\nTuesday, he discussed \"Vondel,<br />\nthe Dutch Shakespeare,\" a dramatist and poet, whose name stands<br />\ngreatest in the literature of the<br />\nNetherlands. He was born in 1587<br />\nand lived to the age of 92. He<br />\nproduced many works during his<br />\nlong literary career, translations of<br />\nthe classics, bibical dramas, dramatic<br />\npoems. Of the latter, his. greatest<br />\nand best known poem, the \"Lucifer,\" furnished the subject for the<br />\nlecture of Wednesday, on \"Vondel's<br />\n'Lucifer,' the Origin of 'Paradise<br />\nLost.'\" Professor Noppen attempted to show the influence of the<br />\nDutch poet upon Milton's epic, as in<br />\nthe use, not only of certain like<br />\ncharacters, but also in similar passages of thought.<br />\nThe indebtedness of Milton to<br />\nVondel for his \"Samson Agonistes\"<br />\nwas even greater, according to the<br />\nlecturer, who spoke Thursday regarding \"Vondel's 'Samson,' the<br />\nOriginal of Milton's 'Samson Agonistes.'\" On Friday the last of the<br />\nseries was delivered on \"Van Eeden,<br />\nthe Dutch Tolstoi, and the Literature since 1880.\" Frederick Van<br />\nEeden is one of the leaders of the<br />\nNaturalist movement in Holland,<br />\nand his novels have received very<br />\nfavorable attention.<br />\nDr. Van Noppen, though a native<br />\nof North Carolina, is of Dutch<br />\ndescent.

Hoch, Delaware's pitcher,<br />\nstruck out ten men, and from the<br />\nthird to the ninth inning allowed no<br />\nhits, but Hopkins' heavy hitting<br />\nlead-off men found him in the ninth<br />\nand eleventh periods for enough<br />\nhits to break the even score.<br />\nBill Noble, desperate and hungry<br />\n(for it was nearly six o'clock), told<br />\nhis teammates on the bench just before he went to bat in the eleventh<br />\ninning that he was due for a long<br />\nhit. He poled out a beautiful triple<br />\nto center, and scored on Sutton's<br />\nsacrifice fly, thus winning the fourth<br />\nconsecutive game for the Black and<br />\nBlue.<br />\nThe battle was certainly thrilling.<br />\nHopkins got 'a lead of three runs<br />\nover Delaware in the third inning,<br />\nbut the Blue and Gray evened the<br />\nscore in the fifth. Then came the<br />\nstruggle to break the deadlock. Hopkins scored twice in the ninth, but<br />\nDelaware evened un in its portion<br />\nof the inning. The tenth period<br />\nlasted fifteen minutes.<br />\nCapt. Pete Porter, the first to bat<br />\nfor Hopkins, sent a liner to first<br />\nbase, but Geoghegan fielded it in<br />\nbig-league style. Then Bill Noble<br />\ndrove out his triple. Inasmuch as it<br />\nwas a question of getting only one<br />\nrun to win, Butts Sutton concluded<br />\nthat it would do to send out a fly<br />\nlong enough to allow Noble to<br />\nscore. This he did. Delaware went<br />\nout in one-two-three order in its<br />\nend of the inning.<br />\nOne of the results of the game<br />\nwas the establishment of the fact<br />\nthat Coach Eddie Hooper hasn't<br />\nheart failure. \"After this game,\"<br />\nhe said, \"no doctor can ever tell me<br />\nI have heart failure. If I had it<br />\nI would have been dead before the<br />\nninth inning.\"<br />\nWhen the game was over the<br />\nplayers had just enough time to<br />\ndress to catch the 6.13 train for<br />\nBaltimore. A number wanted to<br />\n\"make\" the cotillon and it was decided to forego the dinner which<br />\nDelaware had prepared. Butts<br />\nSutton, dressing earlier than the<br />\nrest, found Newark's general store<br />\nand laid in a generous supply of<br />\noranges, fruit crackers and pretzels,<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 2)<br /><br />\nThe Freshman-Sophomore class<br />\nteams will probably be stronger this<br />\nseason and will be more evenly<br />\nmatched than they have been in several years. The lacrosse teams, especially, will be well fortified with<br />\nmen from the 'Varsity squad; and<br />\nconsequently the annual class game<br />\nis expected to be hotly contested.<br />\nThe sophomores have Stuart,<br />\nBaker and Brooks, the three 'Varsity<br />\nclose-defense men, as a nucleus for<br />\ntheir defense; and Boyce, Wilson<br />\nand Paul Sutton on the attack.<br />\nWith these men as a basis, the<br />\nsecond-year men are confident of<br />\nputting a fast team on the field, and<br />\nof atoning for the defeat in football<br />\nwhich they sulfered last fall.<br />\nThe freshmen are equally hopeful<br />\nof having a winning team. Their<br />\nattack contains Wolfe, Woodward,<br />\nFrank Sutton, Mealy and Swartz\u2014<br />\nall on the 'Varsity squad\u2014and several other candidates, including<br />\nEvans, Hooper, Rothschild and Miller. The freshmen defense is not<br />\nas strong as that of the sophomores.<br />\nChalmers has been showing up well<br />\nat goal. Hoffman, Gillet, P. Nelson, Love and Cromwell will probably be the other defense men.<br />\nAllen K. Chalmers, manager of<br />\nthe freshmen baseball team, reports<br />\nthat the prospects for a good showing are exceedingly bright. There<br />\nare a large number of candidates<br />\nout for the team, two or three men<br />\ncontesting for every position. The<br />\nlist of available pitchers is especially<br />\nlong. There is Hollingsworth, the<br />\n'Varsity pitcher, who will probably<br />\nhurl for the freshmen, and there are<br />\nLove, Tavjor, Rolker and Witz, all<br />\non the 'Varsity squad.<br />\nA game with the Towson High<br />\nSchool nine has already been arranged for the freshmen team, and<br />\nit is planned to play several other<br />\nlocal prenaratory schools before the<br />\ngame with the sophomores.<br />\nWe consider health and the right<br />\nattitude toward health as fundamental.

His performance<br />\nin the high hurdles was exceptionally good. Straus also distinguished<br />\nhimself. by his good work in the<br />\nsprints. He won the 220-yard dash<br />\nin very good time (22V-, seconds)<br />\nand was second in the Too-yard<br />\ndash. Wright, who on account of<br />\nan injured muscle had not appeared<br />\nfor Hopkins before this meet, won<br />\nthe Too-yard dash in beautiful<br />\nform, but in the 220 his leg went<br />\nback on him again and he was forced<br />\nto make a weak fiMsh, only taking<br />\nthird place.<br />\nKleinstehn, of Lafayette, ran a<br />\nbeautiful race in the mile run and<br />\nfinished in 4 minutes, 4434 seconds.<br />\nTiall trailed him closely all the way,<br />\nbut was unable to make up the<br />\nthree-yard lead on the home stretch.<br />\nMaxfield, Lafayette's weight man,<br />\nmade exceptionally good throws in<br />\nboth the discus and shot put, making 114 feet and 43 feet. respectively, in these events.

Lehigh's<br />\ntactics, however, proved to be less<br />\nefficient than those of the characteristically well-drilled Black and Blue<br />\nsquad; and, although it had a distinct advantage in weight, the<br />\nBrown and White team was unable<br />\nto cope successfully with the rapidfire work of the Hopkins attack.<br />\nA closer game has not been seen<br />\nat Homewood in many years. Time<br />\nand again the heavy Brown and<br />\nWhite attack would carry the ball<br />\nstraight down the field, only to have<br />\na well-placed shot stopped at the<br />\ngoal.<br />\nWith both teams fighting their<br />\nhardest, the game was rough at<br />\ntimes. As a result of over-zealous<br />\nstickwork on the part of some players, several minor injuries were sustained by players, and at the end of<br />\nthe second half there were few out<br />\nof the twenty-four that left the field<br />\nwho were not stiff and sore from<br />\nrepeated knocks and falls.<br />\nThe work of Captain Troxell,<br />\nLeibensperger, Boyce and Stuart<br />\nwas most prominent in keeping the<br />\nheavy South Bethlehemites from<br />\ntaking the championship.

He showed how indelibly the marks of Dutch national<br />\nhistory are stamped upon its literature.<br />\nTuesday, he discussed \"Vondel,<br />\nthe Dutch Shakespeare,\" a dramatist and poet, whose name stands<br />\ngreatest in the literature of the<br />\nNetherlands. He was born in 1587<br />\nand lived to the age of 92. He<br />\nproduced many works during his<br />\nlong literary career, translations of<br />\nthe classics, bibical dramas, dramatic<br />\npoems. Of the latter, his. greatest<br />\nand best known poem, the \"Lucifer,\" furnished the subject for the<br />\nlecture of Wednesday, on \"Vondel's<br />\n'Lucifer,' the Origin of 'Paradise<br />\nLost.'\" Professor Noppen attempted to show the influence of the<br />\nDutch poet upon Milton's epic, as in<br />\nthe use, not only of certain like<br />\ncharacters, but also in similar passages of thought.<br />\nThe indebtedness of Milton to<br />\nVondel for his \"Samson Agonistes\"<br />\nwas even greater, according to the<br />\nlecturer, who spoke Thursday regarding \"Vondel's 'Samson,' the<br />\nOriginal of Milton's 'Samson Agonistes.'\" On Friday the last of the<br />\nseries was delivered on \"Van Eeden,<br />\nthe Dutch Tolstoi, and the Literature since 1880.\" Frederick Van<br />\nEeden is one of the leaders of the<br />\nNaturalist movement in Holland,<br />\nand his novels have received very<br />\nfavorable attention.<br />\nDr. Van Noppen, though a native<br />\nof North Carolina, is of Dutch<br />\ndescent.
