The election took place<br />\nat a reception given to this year's<br />\nteam by ex-Captain Eddie Hulburt<br />\nat the Hopkins Club.<br />\nThe dinner was voted by all who<br />\nattended as one of the most pleasant ever held. The speakers, particularly Coach Raleigh, excelled<br />\nthemselves. At the dinner it was<br />\ndecided by this year's team that<br />\nthey would give a banner to the<br />\nwinner of the series of lacrosse<br />\ngames between the Sophomores<br />\nand Freshmen.<br />\nThere is no question but that the<br />\nelection will meet with the approval<br />\nof every undergraduate. It would<br />\nbe a difficult thing to point to any<br />\none man on our champion team and<br />\nsay: \"He is the best man.\" They<br />\nwere all the best men. That's why<br />\nwe won the championship. Every<br />\nman on the team played not to gain<br />\nindividual distinction, but to bring<br />\nthe team victory, whatever the cost<br />\nto himself. But Gail has been one<br />\nof the best all-around players on<br />\nthe team. He was always available<br />\nfor any position which had to be<br />\nfilled on short notice. Moreover,<br />\nhis experience of three years on the<br />\n'Varsity team is of great importance. And with all the material<br />\nthat is now in sight there is no reason why another championship banner should not be hung up in the<br />\ntrophy room next year.<br />\n<br />\nThe third annual tennis tournament, open to all members of the<br />\nUniversity, starts today.

The matches will<br />\nall be called at 5 o'clock. The drawing, which was made this morning, will be posted in the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall and out at Homewood. Handsome prizes will be<br />\nawarded to the winner and runnerup and winner of consolation in the<br />\nsingles, and to the winners and runners-up in the doubles. As the<br />\ndoubles entries do not close until<br />\nWednesday, it is hoped that a large<br />\nnumber will still enter in that event.<br />\nThe tournament has been arranged<br />\nby the following committee: Donald K.

Umpire, McAtee.<br />\nSophomores Victorious.<br />\n<br />\nIn the second half the Sophomore<br />\nattack braced up and there was more<br />\nwork for the Freshmen's defense.<br />\nAt one time the Sophomores really<br />\noutplayed the Freshmen. Niles, the<br />\nSophomores' point, was put out of<br />\nthe game for three minutes for<br />\nneedless slugging with his stick.<br />\nThis gave the Freshmen an odd<br />\nman with the ball right in front of<br />\nthe Sophomores' goal. And yet, in<br />\nspite of all this, the Sophomore attack rushed the ball right up to the<br />\nFreshmen's goal. By the time they<br />\nwere stopped and the ball had been<br />\ntaken back up the field Niles was<br />\nback in the game. At the end of<br />\nsixteen minutes of play Randolph,<br />\nwho was playing outhome for the<br />\nSophomores, recovered the ball<br />\nfrom a scrimmage and shot the only<br />\ngoal scored.<br />\nSears, goalkeeper for the Sophomores, played a fine game. The<br />\nFreshmen had more shots for goal<br />\nthan the Sophomores did, and several times had there been an inferior man at goal these shots would<br />\nhave scored.<br />\nFor the Freshmen White, Riley,<br />\nLeibensperger and Wilkens played<br />\na fine game. Wilkens at point was<br />\nparticularly good and several times<br />\nran the whole length of the field<br />\nwith the ball.<br />\nThe line up was:<br />\nSophomores<br />\nPosition<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSears<br />\ngoal<br />\nCoblentz<br />\npoint....... ....Niles<br />\nWilkens<br />\nMelamet<br />\nG.

The feature of the game<br />\nwas the fact that the teams were<br />\nso evenly matched. It was anybody's game all the way through,<br />\nand it was only the one goal that<br />\nwas shot four minutes before the<br />\nend of the second half that finally<br />\ndecided the contest.<br />\nIn the first half the ball was in<br />\nthe Sophomores' territory most of<br />\nthe time. Occasionally one of the<br />\nSophomore defense men would<br />\nbring the ball down the field toward the Freshmen goal, but would<br />\nusually be stopped before he got<br />\nclose enough to do any damage.<br />\nAfter about fifteen minutes of playing White, of the Freshmen, shot<br />\na goal, but because he was in the<br />\n\"creese\" when he made the shot the<br />\npoint did not count.<br />\n<br />\nMrs. Mary C.

Tolson was touched up for<br />\nten safeties, but kept them fairly<br />\nwell scattered, which accounts for<br />\nthe small score made by Hopkins.<br />\nSilvester allowed but two hits,<br />\nneither of which were instrumental<br />\nin scoring runs.<br />\nThe feature of the game was the<br />\nbeautiful squeeze play that St.<br />\nJohn's worked in the second inning<br />\nand which netted the visitors their<br />\ntwo runs. Ruhl was the first batter<br />\nup and received his base on balls.<br />\nClark popped a fly to Webster.<br />\nThompson was struck on the arm,<br />\nsending Ruhl to second. They<br />\nworked a double steal successfully.<br />\nSteele, who was at the bat, was<br />\ngiven the signal for a squeeze play,<br />\nand Ruhl made a dash for the plate<br />\nas Silvester started to throw the<br />\nball. Steele succeeded in connecting with the shoot for a neat little<br />\nbunt, which scored Ruhl. Steele<br />\nwas thrown out at first, but in the<br />\nmeantime Thompson had also<br />\nscored. This ended St. John's run<br />\ngetting for the rest of the game.<br />\nHopkins scored two runs in the<br />\nfirst inning. Smith was struck by<br />\na pitched ball and was given his<br />\nbase. He stole second and crossed<br />\nthe plate on Shaw's timely single.<br />\nShaw also stole second and reached<br />\nhome on Pieper's single. The winning run was made in the eighth<br />\nsession.

The election took place<br />\nat a reception given to this year's<br />\nteam by ex-Captain Eddie Hulburt<br />\nat the Hopkins Club.<br />\nThe dinner was voted by all who<br />\nattended as one of the most pleasant ever held. The speakers, particularly Coach Raleigh, excelled<br />\nthemselves. At the dinner it was<br />\ndecided by this year's team that<br />\nthey would give a banner to the<br />\nwinner of the series of lacrosse<br />\ngames between the Sophomores<br />\nand Freshmen.<br />\nThere is no question but that the<br />\nelection will meet with the approval<br />\nof every undergraduate. It would<br />\nbe a difficult thing to point to any<br />\none man on our champion team and<br />\nsay: \"He is the best man.\" They<br />\nwere all the best men. That's why<br />\nwe won the championship. Every<br />\nman on the team played not to gain<br />\nindividual distinction, but to bring<br />\nthe team victory, whatever the cost<br />\nto himself. But Gail has been one<br />\nof the best all-around players on<br />\nthe team. He was always available<br />\nfor any position which had to be<br />\nfilled on short notice. Moreover,<br />\nhis experience of three years on the<br />\n'Varsity team is of great importance. And with all the material<br />\nthat is now in sight there is no reason why another championship banner should not be hung up in the<br />\ntrophy room next year.<br /><br />\nThe third annual tennis tournament, open to all members of the<br />\nUniversity, starts today. There is<br />\na large list of entries, among them<br />\nsome vet), good players, so that<br />\nthere is no doubt that the gallery<br />\nwill see some good tennis at Homewood this week. The matches will<br />\nall be called at 5 o'clock. The drawing, which was made this morning, will be posted in the basement<br />\nof McCoy Hall and out at Homewood. Handsome prizes will be<br />\nawarded to the winner and runnerup and winner of consolation in the<br />\nsingles, and to the winners and runners-up in the doubles. As the<br />\ndoubles entries do not close until<br />\nWednesday, it is hoped that a large<br />\nnumber will still enter in that event.<br />\nThe tournament has been arranged<br />\nby the following committee: Donald K.

Umpire, McAtee.<br />\nSophomores Victorious.<br /><br />\nIn the second half the Sophomore<br />\nattack braced up and there was more<br />\nwork for the Freshmen's defense.<br />\nAt one time the Sophomores really<br />\noutplayed the Freshmen. Niles, the<br />\nSophomores' point, was put out of<br />\nthe game for three minutes for<br />\nneedless slugging with his stick.<br />\nThis gave the Freshmen an odd<br />\nman with the ball right in front of<br />\nthe Sophomores' goal. And yet, in<br />\nspite of all this, the Sophomore attack rushed the ball right up to the<br />\nFreshmen's goal. By the time they<br />\nwere stopped and the ball had been<br />\ntaken back up the field Niles was<br />\nback in the game. At the end of<br />\nsixteen minutes of play Randolph,<br />\nwho was playing outhome for the<br />\nSophomores, recovered the ball<br />\nfrom a scrimmage and shot the only<br />\ngoal scored.<br />\nSears, goalkeeper for the Sophomores, played a fine game. The<br />\nFreshmen had more shots for goal<br />\nthan the Sophomores did, and several times had there been an inferior man at goal these shots would<br />\nhave scored.<br />\nFor the Freshmen White, Riley,<br />\nLeibensperger and Wilkens played<br />\na fine game. Wilkens at point was<br />\nparticularly good and several times<br />\nran the whole length of the field<br />\nwith the ball.<br />\nThe line up was:<br />\nSophomores<br />\nPosition<br />\nFreshmen<br />\nSears<br />\ngoal<br />\nCoblentz<br />\npoint....... ....Niles<br />\nWilkens<br />\nMelamet<br />\nG.

The feature of the game<br />\nwas the fact that the teams were<br />\nso evenly matched. It was anybody's game all the way through,<br />\nand it was only the one goal that<br />\nwas shot four minutes before the<br />\nend of the second half that finally<br />\ndecided the contest.<br />\nIn the first half the ball was in<br />\nthe Sophomores' territory most of<br />\nthe time. Occasionally one of the<br />\nSophomore defense men would<br />\nbring the ball down the field toward the Freshmen goal, but would<br />\nusually be stopped before he got<br />\nclose enough to do any damage.<br />\nAfter about fifteen minutes of playing White, of the Freshmen, shot<br />\na goal, but because he was in the<br />\n\"creese\" when he made the shot the<br />\npoint did not count.<br /><br />\nMrs. Mary C.
