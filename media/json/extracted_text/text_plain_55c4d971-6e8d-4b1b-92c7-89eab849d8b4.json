XXII, NO. 15.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nThe College Student and the War<br />\nBy HERBERT HOOVER<br />\nUnited States Food Administrator.<br />\n<br />\n(From the Patriotic News Service of<br />\nthe National Committee of Patriotic<br />\nSocieties, Washington, D. C.)<br />\n<br />\nTo the college men of America I<br />\naddress myself with confidence, a<br />\nconfidence born of unforgettable<br />\nexperience.<br />\nIn the relief of Belgium most of<br />\nthe actual work of the Commission in the occupied territory was<br />\ndone by young American collegians. Each time a call was<br />\nmade for volunteers many more<br />\nthan asked for offered their services. And those that were chosen<br />\nperformed their duties, not only<br />\neffectively, but with a spirit of devotion that made their service beyond praise. They combined idealism and efficiency. It is the combination that moves the world forward.<br />\nToday all the young college men<br />\nof America face,a special responsibility and duty. At no time in the<br />\nworld's history has the technically<br />\ntrained mind been at a higher premium. And this need for it and<br />\ndemand on it will continue after<br />\nthe war is over. Hence the young<br />\nman in college is faced with a serious problem. He must ask hinrself: Is the immediate need of me<br />\nby my country in my present stage<br />\nof training greater than this need<br />\nwill be later, and when I have acquired a higher training? This is<br />\na question the clear answer to<br />\nwhich cannot be indicated for all<br />\nby a single formula,..because the<br />\nyoung men in college find themselves under varying circumstances. Yet an answer in general<br />\nterms of some helpfulness may be<br />\nmade.<br />\nTo the younger men, the lower<br />\nclassmen, only beginning their<br />\nprofessional training, I say: Keep<br />\non with your college work. If the<br />\nwar lasts long you will be needed<br />\nmore later than now; and you<br />\nwill be better qualified to fill the<br />\nneed then. If the war ends soon<br />\nthere will still be urgent need for<br />\nyour help in the necessary great<br />\nwork of reconstruction and rehabilitation. The moreadvancedyour<br />\ntraining, the more mature your<br />\njudgment, the more valuable you<br />\n\u2022 will be. So try to possess yourself<br />\nin patience and stick to your college work.<br />\nTo the upper classmen I would<br />\nsay: Hold yourself ready to respond to your country's present<br />\nneed at any moment. Where you<br />\nsee your way clear to make your<br />\ntraining useful do not hesitate to<br />\nfollow the way. But you, too,<br />\nshould remember that every additional month or semester of train(Continued on page 2, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., JANUARY 28, 1918.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENT<br />\n<br />\nBATTALION DEFENDS BALTIMORE \"JOE\" ENGLAND ENTERS SERVICE<br />\n<br />\nDR.

There is very much<br />\nthat you can do right now.<br />\nI would call your attention to<br />\njust one of the many ways in<br />\nwhich you can help, and help importantly. It is the way to insuring the absolutely necessary food<br />\nsupply to ourselves, and to our<br />\nAllies.<br />\nEspecially must the matter of<br />\nthe food supply of our Allies be<br />\nstressed. The vital world problem<br />\nof food is not generally understood. The popular view is too<br />\nself-centered, too selfish\u2014to use<br />\nan ugly word. It does not look<br />\nacross the sea. The back-wash of<br />\nEurope's misery does not carry to<br />\nour shores. We do not know, and<br />\nhence cannot feel, the pangs of<br />\nhunger, and pain of hunger weakness that are everywhere in Europe. They are pains felt by our<br />\nAllies as well as by our foes. We<br />\nmust make this known to all our<br />\npeople, that all our people may understand the great and indispensable and immediate role they<br />\nmust play in this all-important<br />\npart of the war situation. You<br />\nwho can readily understand must<br />\nhelp.<br />\nYou can impress on the people<br />\naround you, and wherever you go,<br />\nthe fact that the critical phase of<br />\nthe world food problem is now, not<br />\nthe questipn of high or low<br />\nprices, but the question of producing and saving and sending<br />\nenough food to our Allies to keep<br />\nthem alive and strong and steadfast in war. The critical question<br />\nnow in this war is the question of<br />\nthe actual physical strength of the<br />\nfighting nations.<br />\nYou can understand it, and you<br />\ncan explain it. You can help us,<br />\nlet the people of this country know<br />\nthat our Allies depend absolutely<br />\non us to maintain their food supply. They, themselves, simply cannot do it. If it is not done for<br />\nthem by us the end of the war is<br />\nnear, and it is a bad end, an inconceivably bad end. From every<br />\nAmerican college man the country<br />\nexpects the truest devotion, the<br />\ntruest patriotism and the highest<br />\nservice. And it will get it.

A week of<br />\ndoubt, speculation and sleepless<br />\nnights has cast its shadows\u2014with<br />\nthe uncanny precision and inevitability,-(hat only an official schedule of examinations can depict\u2014<br />\nover the snow and through the<br />\nhalls of Homewood. For some,<br />\nthe experienced, it has been just<br />\na year since those messengers of<br />\nthe gods\u2014Bismarck and George\u2014<br />\ncleared the Donovan Room -for the<br />\nrickety, two-by-one tables and the<br />\nneatly printed sets of questions<br />\nwere distributed to despondent<br />\nstudents. For others, the uninitiated, a horrible ordeal looms up<br />\nwith all the mysteries and terrors<br />\nthat a freshman imagination can<br />\ndevise. For still others, a chosen<br />\nfew, there are memories\u2014sweetened somewhat by age\u2014of an ominous exodus of chairs from an expansive old lecture hall which was<br />\nonly to be immediately afterward<br />\nplanted with row upon row of the<br />\nsame pine tables over which bent<br />\ntired and flushed faces altogether<br />\nunmindful of the consoling inscription nestling far above the<br />\nrestful green curtains against the<br />\nceiling, \"Veritas vos Liberabit.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn spite of the fact that we<br />\nknow that examinations are just<br />\nas inevitable as death and taxes,<br />\nand that we should do better to<br />\nspend every minute of our time to<br />\nprepare to meet them, we feel<br />\nprompted to meditate upon the<br />\nsignificance and utility of examinations. In regard to the utility<br />\nof examinations, we readily conclude that examinations, per se,<br />\nmean very litle or nothing. What<br />\nwe cram on the eve of an examination, we rarely know two weeks<br />\nlater. Examinations are at best<br />\na convenient (for want of a better) means to an end; they are<br />\nthe means employed by the faculty to test a student's knowledge<br />\nof the courses he undertakes. We<br />\nmay satisfy ourselves by classifying examinations under that long<br />\nlist of \"necessary evils.\"<br />\nThe significance of\u2022 exarnina:<br />\nlions lies, therefore, not in their<br />\nintrinsic, but rather in their relative value. On the eve of examinations, A brief account of the relation of examinations to University honors and privileges and traditions ought not to be out of<br />\nplace. There are four subjects, intimately connected with examinations, that may be discussed.<br />\nFirst, the Phi Beta Kappa. Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa is a national, honorary organization, membership in<br />\nwhich is based upon excellence in<br />\nscholarship. The fact that seven<br />\nof the last nine Presidents of the<br />\nUnited States werePhi Beta Kappa men may mean something more<br />\nthan a mere coincidence. A student's average for the entire four<br />\nyears forms the basis of eligibility<br />\ninto this society. The time to set<br />\nout for a Phi Beta Kappa key is<br />\nin your freshman year,\u2014a poor<br />\naverage for his first year cost<br />\nmany a man his chances for honors. A Phi Beta Kappa key<br />\nmeans much more than an attractive watch-charm.<br />\nSecond, the Omicron Delta Kappa. The Omicron Delta Kappa is<br />\nan honorary fraternity, a chapter<br />\nof which was recently founded at<br />\nHopkins, and membership in<br />\nwhich is one of the highest honors<br />\naccorded to a student qt the University. Excellence in scholarship<br />\nis one of the five bases upon which<br />\na student becomes eligible for<br />\nmembership. The Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa key is an honor worthy of<br />\nthe best efforts of every student.<br />\nThird, the Hopkins scholarships. At the end of each year,<br />\nthe University awards to the members of each class four competitive scholarships covering the<br />\ntuition fee for one year. These<br />\nscholarships are based on. the average for the year's work. The<br />\nmaterial reward for excellence in<br />\nscholarships is added to the high<br />\nhonor of being a Hopkins scholar.<br />\nFourth, the blacklist.<br />\nThe<br />\nblacklist is at the same time the<br />\nmost popular and the most unpopular outgrowth of the examinations. Among the rules of the<br />\nUniversity there lurks: \"No stu-<br />\n<br />\ndent shall be a member of or a<br />\ncandidate for an athletic team, or<br />\na ?musical or dramatic club if his<br />\nscholarship overage on the preceding official record is below 7.\"<br />\nThat is, in plain terms, the blacklist\u2014the bane of the athletic<br />\nteams and all student activities.<br />\nThat the blacklist is absolutely<br />\ninflexible and unyielding may be<br />\nverified by the captain of any<br />\nteam. The blacklist is the most<br />\neloquent and effective reminder<br />\nyou will meet that scholarships is<br />\nprimary, supreme, at Johns Hopkins, and that student activities<br />\n\u2014however desirable and beneficial<br />\n\u2014are secondary, subordinate. To<br />\nbe on the blacklist is to be<br />\nstamped as unworthy of affiliation<br />\nwith the Joh,ns Hopkins University.<br />\nMEMORIAL SERVICE FOR DR.

The object of<br />\nthis order is to save fuel. It is<br />\ndesigned to add another day besides Saturday on which all coal<br />\nbeyond absolute needs might be<br />\nsaved, not that all ,fuel saving \u2022<br />\nmight be concentrated upon one<br />\nday. Dr. Garfield and others in<br />\nposition to recognize the gravity<br />\nof affairs, after complete investigation of current needs, fully understand the present and future<br />\ndemands upon our fuel resources;<br />\ntherefore, they have promulgated<br />\nthese drastic measures.<br />\nIt seems to me that the University has entirely misinterpreted<br />\nthe meaning of Dr. Garfield's orders. In shifting Monday's classes<br />\nto Saturday the authorities seem<br />\nto have forgotten that the object<br />\nis to add another extra day on<br />\nwhich fuel may be saved. The<br />\npoint is to have'Monday an extra<br />\nday, not a substitute day. On<br />\nSaturday numerous rooms of all<br />\nthree of our buildings need no<br />\nheat. This fact allows fuel for at<br />\nleast one-half a day te be saved.<br />\nBy closing the buildings likewise<br />\non Monday perhaps another halfday's fuel might be saved. The argument is advanced that the University has sufficient coal to last<br />\nsix or eight weeks. Why \"shut<br />\ndown\" with this supply on hand?<br />\nThat is not the question. When<br />\nour present supply is exhausted<br />\nwe will need more.

They would be<br />\nwilling to spend a few extra weeks<br />\nat the University at the end of<br />\nthe year if by doing so they can<br />\nfurther the cause of their country. But the students do want<br />\ntheir Alma Mater to co-operate<br />\n<br />\nwith the Government not only in<br />\none or two ways, but in every way.<br />\nUnder the present orders it seems<br />\nthat we are trying to evade the<br />\nlaw.

Eleven<br />\nstalwart sophomores, already wellversed in many bloodthirsty and<br />\nmurderous arts\u2014as the freshmen<br />\nwill attest\u2014presented themselves<br />\nfor instruction.<br />\nAbout three times this number<br />\nhad given in their names as being<br />\ninterested in fencing, and it is expected that in the future the<br />\nclasses will be much better attended. These classes, which must<br />\nbe attended in uniform, are given<br />\nevery Wednesday and Friday from<br />\n4 to 6 o'clock. From 6 to 10<br />\nmen will finally be selected<br />\nas battalion fencing instructors<br />\nfor the latter part of this year and<br />\nalso for following years. These<br />\nmen, will, moreover, form a nucleus, around which to build a<br />\nfencing team that will probably<br />\nnext year meet the teams of the<br />\nlarge colleges and also the Naval<br />\nand Military academies. Hence,<br />\nthere is a big work cut out for the<br />\nbattalion, and especially the sophomores, from whom it is preferred<br />\nthat the fencing instructors be selected.<br />\nMr. Kistler uses the methods<br />\nemployed at the Naval Academy,<br />\nand puts the candidates through a<br />\nthorough workout. They were<br />\nfirst drilled till proficient in the<br />\nsix positions preliminary to \"on<br />\nguard,\" then in advancing, retreating, extending, and lunging.<br />\nWhen these movements had been<br />\npracticed, the embryo fencers were<br />\npaired off\u2014the lucky ones using<br />\nfoils and the rest wooden wands\u2014<br />\nand shown the different engagements where to thrust and how to<br />\nparry. As there were no freshmen<br />\npresent, no bloodshed ensued, but<br />\nthe next morning several of the<br />\nfencers complained vigorously of<br />\nstiff backs and knees.<br />\nAfter foil work will ccime broadsword and bayonet practice, the<br />\nlatter so especially needed by our<br />\nfuture soldiers. When the use of<br />\nthe foil has been mastered with<br />\nthe right hand, the fencers will,<br />\nfor the sake of practice and exercise, wield the weapon with the<br />\nleft.

C.)<br /><br />\nTo the college men of America I<br />\naddress myself with confidence, a<br />\nconfidence born of unforgettable<br />\nexperience.<br />\nIn the relief of Belgium most of<br />\nthe actual work of the Commission in the occupied territory was<br />\ndone by young American collegians. Each time a call was<br />\nmade for volunteers many more<br />\nthan asked for offered their services. And those that were chosen<br />\nperformed their duties, not only<br />\neffectively, but with a spirit of devotion that made their service beyond praise. They combined idealism and efficiency. It is the combination that moves the world forward.<br />\nToday all the young college men<br />\nof America face,a special responsibility and duty. At no time in the<br />\nworld's history has the technically<br />\ntrained mind been at a higher premium. And this need for it and<br />\ndemand on it will continue after<br />\nthe war is over. Hence the young<br />\nman in college is faced with a serious problem. He must ask hinrself: Is the immediate need of me<br />\nby my country in my present stage<br />\nof training greater than this need<br />\nwill be later, and when I have acquired a higher training? This is<br />\na question the clear answer to<br />\nwhich cannot be indicated for all<br />\nby a single formula,..because the<br />\nyoung men in college find themselves under varying circumstances. Yet an answer in general<br />\nterms of some helpfulness may be<br />\nmade.<br />\nTo the younger men, the lower<br />\nclassmen, only beginning their<br />\nprofessional training, I say: Keep<br />\non with your college work. If the<br />\nwar lasts long you will be needed<br />\nmore later than now; and you<br />\nwill be better qualified to fill the<br />\nneed then. If the war ends soon<br />\nthere will still be urgent need for<br />\nyour help in the necessary great<br />\nwork of reconstruction and rehabilitation. The moreadvancedyour<br />\ntraining, the more mature your<br />\njudgment, the more valuable you<br />\n\u2022 will be. So try to possess yourself<br />\nin patience and stick to your college work.<br />\nTo the upper classmen I would<br />\nsay: Hold yourself ready to respond to your country's present<br />\nneed at any moment.

There is very much<br />\nthat you can do right now.<br />\nI would call your attention to<br />\njust one of the many ways in<br />\nwhich you can help, and help importantly. It is the way to insuring the absolutely necessary food<br />\nsupply to ourselves, and to our<br />\nAllies.<br />\nEspecially must the matter of<br />\nthe food supply of our Allies be<br />\nstressed. The vital world problem<br />\nof food is not generally understood. The popular view is too<br />\nself-centered, too selfish\u2014to use<br />\nan ugly word. It does not look<br />\nacross the sea. The back-wash of<br />\nEurope's misery does not carry to<br />\nour shores. We do not know, and<br />\nhence cannot feel, the pangs of<br />\nhunger, and pain of hunger weakness that are everywhere in Europe. They are pains felt by our<br />\nAllies as well as by our foes. We<br />\nmust make this known to all our<br />\npeople, that all our people may understand the great and indispensable and immediate role they<br />\nmust play in this all-important<br />\npart of the war situation. You<br />\nwho can readily understand must<br />\nhelp.<br />\nYou can impress on the people<br />\naround you, and wherever you go,<br />\nthe fact that the critical phase of<br />\nthe world food problem is now, not<br />\nthe questipn of high or low<br />\nprices, but the question of producing and saving and sending<br />\nenough food to our Allies to keep<br />\nthem alive and strong and steadfast in war. The critical question<br />\nnow in this war is the question of<br />\nthe actual physical strength of the<br />\nfighting nations.<br />\nYou can understand it, and you<br />\ncan explain it. You can help us,<br />\nlet the people of this country know<br />\nthat our Allies depend absolutely<br />\non us to maintain their food supply. They, themselves, simply cannot do it. If it is not done for<br />\nthem by us the end of the war is<br />\nnear, and it is a bad end, an inconceivably bad end. From every<br />\nAmerican college man the country<br />\nexpects the truest devotion, the<br />\ntruest patriotism and the highest<br />\nservice. And it will get it. You<br />\nwill give it.<br /><br />\ning will make you a more effective<br />\nhelper to your country in this time<br />\nof its emergency, ever growing<br />\nmore critical. So be willing and<br />\nready to go out, but go in no<br />\nthoughtless hurry, nor merely to<br />\nsatisfy the natural restlessness of<br />\nthe moment.<br />\nFinally, to both lower and upper classmen, and to the great<br />\narmy of American college and university graduates, I would say:<br />\nThe country looks to you for justification of the advantages it has<br />\ngiven or is now giving you.

A week of<br />\ndoubt, speculation and sleepless<br />\nnights has cast its shadows\u2014with<br />\nthe uncanny precision and inevitability,-(hat only an official schedule of examinations can depict\u2014<br />\nover the snow and through the<br />\nhalls of Homewood. For some,<br />\nthe experienced, it has been just<br />\na year since those messengers of<br />\nthe gods\u2014Bismarck and George\u2014<br />\ncleared the Donovan Room -for the<br />\nrickety, two-by-one tables and the<br />\nneatly printed sets of questions<br />\nwere distributed to despondent<br />\nstudents. For others, the uninitiated, a horrible ordeal looms up<br />\nwith all the mysteries and terrors<br />\nthat a freshman imagination can<br />\ndevise. For still others, a chosen<br />\nfew, there are memories\u2014sweetened somewhat by age\u2014of an ominous exodus of chairs from an expansive old lecture hall which was<br />\nonly to be immediately afterward<br />\nplanted with row upon row of the<br />\nsame pine tables over which bent<br />\ntired and flushed faces altogether<br />\nunmindful of the consoling inscription nestling far above the<br />\nrestful green curtains against the<br />\nceiling, \"Veritas vos Liberabit.\"<br /><br />\nIn spite of the fact that we<br />\nknow that examinations are just<br />\nas inevitable as death and taxes,<br />\nand that we should do better to<br />\nspend every minute of our time to<br />\nprepare to meet them, we feel<br />\nprompted to meditate upon the<br />\nsignificance and utility of examinations. In regard to the utility<br />\nof examinations, we readily conclude that examinations, per se,<br />\nmean very litle or nothing. What<br />\nwe cram on the eve of an examination, we rarely know two weeks<br />\nlater. Examinations are at best<br />\na convenient (for want of a better) means to an end; they are<br />\nthe means employed by the faculty to test a student's knowledge<br />\nof the courses he undertakes. We<br />\nmay satisfy ourselves by classifying examinations under that long<br />\nlist of \"necessary evils.\"<br />\nThe significance of\u2022 exarnina:<br />\nlions lies, therefore, not in their<br />\nintrinsic, but rather in their relative value. On the eve of examinations, A brief account of the relation of examinations to University honors and privileges and traditions ought not to be out of<br />\nplace. There are four subjects, intimately connected with examinations, that may be discussed.<br />\nFirst, the Phi Beta Kappa. Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa is a national, honorary organization, membership in<br />\nwhich is based upon excellence in<br />\nscholarship. The fact that seven<br />\nof the last nine Presidents of the<br />\nUnited States werePhi Beta Kappa men may mean something more<br />\nthan a mere coincidence. A student's average for the entire four<br />\nyears forms the basis of eligibility<br />\ninto this society. The time to set<br />\nout for a Phi Beta Kappa key is<br />\nin your freshman year,\u2014a poor<br />\naverage for his first year cost<br />\nmany a man his chances for honors. A Phi Beta Kappa key<br />\nmeans much more than an attractive watch-charm.<br />\nSecond, the Omicron Delta Kappa. The Omicron Delta Kappa is<br />\nan honorary fraternity, a chapter<br />\nof which was recently founded at<br />\nHopkins, and membership in<br />\nwhich is one of the highest honors<br />\naccorded to a student qt the University. Excellence in scholarship<br />\nis one of the five bases upon which<br />\na student becomes eligible for<br />\nmembership. The Omicron Delta<br />\nKappa key is an honor worthy of<br />\nthe best efforts of every student.<br />\nThird, the Hopkins scholarships. At the end of each year,<br />\nthe University awards to the members of each class four competitive scholarships covering the<br />\ntuition fee for one year. These<br />\nscholarships are based on. the average for the year's work. The<br />\nmaterial reward for excellence in<br />\nscholarships is added to the high<br />\nhonor of being a Hopkins scholar.<br />\nFourth, the blacklist.<br />\nThe<br />\nblacklist is at the same time the<br />\nmost popular and the most unpopular outgrowth of the examinations. Among the rules of the<br />\nUniversity there lurks: \"No stu-<br /><br />\ndent shall be a member of or a<br />\ncandidate for an athletic team, or<br />\na ?musical or dramatic club if his<br />\nscholarship overage on the preceding official record is below 7.\"<br />\nThat is, in plain terms, the blacklist\u2014the bane of the athletic<br />\nteams and all student activities.<br />\nThat the blacklist is absolutely<br />\ninflexible and unyielding may be<br />\nverified by the captain of any<br />\nteam. The blacklist is the most<br />\neloquent and effective reminder<br />\nyou will meet that scholarships is<br />\nprimary, supreme, at Johns Hopkins, and that student activities<br />\n\u2014however desirable and beneficial<br />\n\u2014are secondary, subordinate. To<br />\nbe on the blacklist is to be<br />\nstamped as unworthy of affiliation<br />\nwith the Joh,ns Hopkins University.<br />\nMEMORIAL SERVICE FOR DR.

A series<br />\nof events combined to prevent the<br />\ndebate being held earlier in the<br />\nyear, viz: the difficulty in deciding<br />\nupon a subject, the necessity of<br />\nwithdrawing the first subject, and<br />\nfinally the coal shortage.<br />\nSoon after collegeopened thisfall<br />\nthe Debating Council entered into<br />\nnegotiations with the Universities<br />\nof Virginia and North _Carolina<br />\nfor deciding upon a subject for the<br />\ntriOigular debate, which has been<br />\ntraditionally used as:the subject<br />\nof the interclass debate.

The object of<br />\nthis order is to save fuel. It is<br />\ndesigned to add another day besides Saturday on which all coal<br />\nbeyond absolute needs might be<br />\nsaved, not that all ,fuel saving \u2022<br />\nmight be concentrated upon one<br />\nday. Dr. Garfield and others in<br />\nposition to recognize the gravity<br />\nof affairs, after complete investigation of current needs, fully understand the present and future<br />\ndemands upon our fuel resources;<br />\ntherefore, they have promulgated<br />\nthese drastic measures.<br />\nIt seems to me that the University has entirely misinterpreted<br />\nthe meaning of Dr. Garfield's orders. In shifting Monday's classes<br />\nto Saturday the authorities seem<br />\nto have forgotten that the object<br />\nis to add another extra day on<br />\nwhich fuel may be saved. The<br />\npoint is to have'Monday an extra<br />\nday, not a substitute day. On<br />\nSaturday numerous rooms of all<br />\nthree of our buildings need no<br />\nheat. This fact allows fuel for at<br />\nleast one-half a day te be saved.<br />\nBy closing the buildings likewise<br />\non Monday perhaps another halfday's fuel might be saved. The argument is advanced that the University has sufficient coal to last<br />\nsix or eight weeks. Why \"shut<br />\ndown\" with this supply on hand?<br />\nThat is not the question. When<br />\nour present supply is exhausted<br />\nwe will need more. Why not do<br />\nas our Government orders and<br />\nmake our coal on hand last as long<br />\nas possible so that we will not<br />\nneed to procure more and thus<br />\nscant private families?<br />\nI hope my motive in writing<br />\nthis letter is not misunderstood.<br />\nThe students are not greedy for<br />\nholidays. The student body fully<br />\nappreciates the duty of working<br />\ndiligently at their studies\u2014an ob1 igation which the Government<br />\nhas placed upon them\u2014and that<br />\nthey will expend every energy for<br />\nthe fulfillment of this due, there<br />\nis now no doubt. They would be<br />\nwilling to spend a few extra weeks<br />\nat the University at the end of<br />\nthe year if by doing so they can<br />\nfurther the cause of their country. But the students do want<br />\ntheir Alma Mater to co-operate<br /><br />\nwith the Government not only in<br />\none or two ways, but in every way.<br />\nUnder the present orders it seems<br />\nthat we are trying to evade the<br />\nlaw. We have never shirked our<br />\nduty; we must not do so now.<br />\nOur traditions must be upheld.<br />\nAnd,then, there is the greater purpose\u2014Germany must be defeated.<br />\nNo shirking. No slacking. Let's<br />\nall get behind Uncle Sam, not only<br />\nin letter, bust in spirit, and do our<br />\nshare. Save coal and defeat Germany.<br />\nEDMUND L. GETTIER, JR.,'20.<br />\nJanuary 24, 1918.<br />\nZionist Society Organized.<br /><br />\nAt a meeting of the Jewish students of the University in the Donovan room on last Thursday, after<br />\nan interesting address by Israel<br />\nB. Brodie, a well-known member<br />\nof the Baltimore Bar, plans were<br />\nformulated whereby students interested in Zionism will be able to<br />\nstudy the subject by means of lectures to be given by some of the<br />\nforemost Zionists in the United<br />\nStates.<br />\nGreat interest was shown at the<br />\nmeeting. In his address Mr.<br />\nBrodie told how the great nations<br />\nof the world have thrown down<br />\nthe gage to the Jewish people.<br />\nDiscussing the manifesto of the<br />\nBritish Government, the declaration of the Serbian Government,<br />\nand President Wilson's statement<br />\nthat there must be full autonomy<br />\namong the separate nationalities<br />\nin the Turkish Empire as a step<br />\ntoward peace, Mr. Brodie pointed<br />\nout that the period was one of the<br />\nmost momentous since the beginning of the Jewish dispersion<br />\n2,000 years ago.

BLOODY :TIMES AHEAD<br />\nSergt. Kistler Supervises Training of<br />\nDaring Musketeers in Art of Fencing\u2014Don't Pick Fights With<br />\nSophomores!<br /><br />\nThe first class in fencing was<br />\nheld Wednesday, January 23, at 4<br />\nP. M. under Sergeant Kistler, instructor in the R. 0. T. C. Eleven<br />\nstalwart sophomores, already wellversed in many bloodthirsty and<br />\nmurderous arts\u2014as the freshmen<br />\nwill attest\u2014presented themselves<br />\nfor instruction.<br />\nAbout three times this number<br />\nhad given in their names as being<br />\ninterested in fencing, and it is expected that in the future the<br />\nclasses will be much better attended. These classes, which must<br />\nbe attended in uniform, are given<br />\nevery Wednesday and Friday from<br />\n4 to 6 o'clock. From 6 to 10<br />\nmen will finally be selected<br />\nas battalion fencing instructors<br />\nfor the latter part of this year and<br />\nalso for following years. These<br />\nmen, will, moreover, form a nucleus, around which to build a<br />\nfencing team that will probably<br />\nnext year meet the teams of the<br />\nlarge colleges and also the Naval<br />\nand Military academies. Hence,<br />\nthere is a big work cut out for the<br />\nbattalion, and especially the sophomores, from whom it is preferred<br />\nthat the fencing instructors be selected.<br />\nMr. Kistler uses the methods<br />\nemployed at the Naval Academy,<br />\nand puts the candidates through a<br />\nthorough workout. They were<br />\nfirst drilled till proficient in the<br />\nsix positions preliminary to \"on<br />\nguard,\" then in advancing, retreating, extending, and lunging.<br />\nWhen these movements had been<br />\npracticed, the embryo fencers were<br />\npaired off\u2014the lucky ones using<br />\nfoils and the rest wooden wands\u2014<br />\nand shown the different engagements where to thrust and how to<br />\nparry. As there were no freshmen<br />\npresent, no bloodshed ensued, but<br />\nthe next morning several of the<br />\nfencers complained vigorously of<br />\nstiff backs and knees.<br />\nAfter foil work will ccime broadsword and bayonet practice, the<br />\nlatter so especially needed by our<br />\nfuture soldiers. When the use of<br />\nthe foil has been mastered with<br />\nthe right hand, the fencers will,<br />\nfor the sake of practice and exercise, wield the weapon with the<br />\nleft. Lessons from a text book will<br />\nbe later assigned. Thus, it is<br />\nplanned to institute a very thorough course in fencing in the battalion.<br /><br />\nYankee Trooper\u2014Parly voo English, Mademoiselle?<br />\nFrench Maid\u2014Yes, a vairy leetle.<br />\nY.
