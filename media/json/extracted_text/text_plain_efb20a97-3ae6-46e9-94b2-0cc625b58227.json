The woman had<br />\nbeen intoxicated and some<br />\nmembers of the community felt<br />\nthat she got what she deserved.<br />\nFemale students were outraged upon hearing these sentiments. They were incensed by<br />\nthe fact that a male student<br />\nwould have helped a fellow<br />\nmale student who was intoxicated, but in the case of a<br />\nfemale student in the same<br />\nsituation, they chose to victimize her.<br />\nThe women's center demanded that immediate action be<br />\ntaken. As a result, all social activities of the fraternity were<br />\nsuspended for a year and the<br />\nmen involved were punished.<br />\nWells used this situaton to<br />\ndescribe the widespread acceptance and socialization of<br />\nassault. \"Some of the men I<br />\ntalked with were unaware that<br />\nthis assault constituted a<br />\ncriminal offense,\" said Wells.<br />\nA film entitled \"The Party<br />\nGame\" was the next feature of<br />\nthe seminar.

She wants to<br />\nreturn to the others, but he<br />\nwon't let her leave. When she<br />\nresists him, he rapes her.<br />\nThe film concluded at this<br />\npoint and Wells encouraged<br />\nobservations from the audience. One student expressed<br />\na somewhat common feeling:<br />\n\"The scenes are too close for<br />\ncomfort.\"<br />\nAnother said, \"The girl was<br />\ntoo naive and trusting.\" One of<br />\nthe men in the audience continued, \"The man is primarily<br />\nat fault.

The panel found that<br />\nthere is an \"urgent need for improvement\"<br />\nin providing a general basis of knowledge for<br />\npre-med and medical students.<br />\nDr. Steven Muller, panel chairman and<br />\npresident of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\ncommented,\"We perceive a continuing erosion of general education for physicians, an<br />\nerosion that has not been arrested but is instead accelerating.\"<br />\nWe agree, but such analysis should not be<br />\nrestricted to premedical and medical<br />\nstudents, or even to preprofessional students.<br />\nEvery student should have a broad-based<br />\neducation and should be encouraged to participate in independent learning outside of<br />\nhis major field of study.<br />\nThis philosophy is sound but it is unlikely that any new developments will be introduced until some time in the future. We<br />\nmust currently concentrate on strengthening<br />\nexisting resources to accomplish these goals.<br />\nInterest in the Intersession program at<br />\nJohns Hopkins has been suffering an unfortunate decline over the past few years. The<br />\naverage enrollment in Intersession courses is<br />\napproximately 19%, with over half of the<br />\nstudents participating in research or independent study. This fact is surprising since other<br />\n<br />\nschools with non-mandatory Intersessionlike programs, such as Oberlin and<br />\nHamilton, can boast enrollments of over<br />\n7007o. It is also disheartening, since Intersession is a period in which students may explore novel subjects without the pressure of<br />\nthe traditional semester system.<br />\nThe Committee on Undergraduate Studies<br />\nhas suggested that the weakness of the<br />\nHopkins program may be traced to two<br />\nrelated causes.<br />\n\"The first is that the program has<br />\nhistorically received no commitment, dollarwise or energywise, from the University, and<br />\nso is dependent entirely on the altruism of<br />\nfaculty or the persuasiveness of undergraduates for its academic composition.<br />\n\"The second, directly derived from the<br />\nfirst, is that students' attitudes are so<br />\nnegative about the current program that they<br />\nare inclined to look upon Intersession more<br />\nas a burden than an opportunity.\"<br />\nThus, the Johns Hopkins University is<br />\nfailing to take advantage of a resource which<br />\ncould potentially alleviate \"the continuing<br />\nerosion of general education.\"<br />\nThe program must be strengthened. Professors should be paid for courses they teach.<br />\nAssistant professors should be required to<br />\nteach Intersession courses and the administration should take such activity into<br />\naccount when determining tenure. Basic<br />\nsurvey courses as well as upper division<br />\ncourses should be made more available.<br />\nPerhaps then enough interest will be<br />\ngenerated in the program to defend its<br />\nexistence.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nSexism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to point out to<br />\nthe women of this campus who<br />\nthink sexual harassment is not<br />\na serious problem unlike rape<br />\nwhich is a \"serious, violent<br />\ncrime and should not be treated<br />\nas sexual harassment,\" that<br />\nthey both spawn from the same<br />\nproblem: the subjugation of<br />\nwomen. Rape is not a crime of<br />\npassion, but one of power, used to enforce the will, and<br />\nthereby keep the victims in a<br />\nsubordinate role; it perpetuates<br />\nthe rigid hierarchy in society.<br />\nSimilarly, to sexually harass<br />\nand then accuse the women of<br />\nbeing \"uppity\" because they<br />\ndemand to be treated with<br />\nrespect inherent to a human bein tz is a power play.<br />\nAnother point for the women<br />\nof th undergraduate community to consider is that this issue<br />\nof sexism may not be important<br />\nnow, because it doesn't bring<br />\nup your G.

There seems to be a growing pattern of intolerance in<br />\nprecisely those circles where one<br />\nmight least expect to find it. For<br />\nexample, in several states,<br />\nfeminist groups (such as<br />\nWomen Against Pornography)<br />\nhave formed alliances with the<br />\nMoral Majority and other farright organizations in an attempt to legislate sweeping bans<br />\non pornography. The law most<br />\nfrequently proposed by the<br />\nfeminists would allow a woman<br />\nto bring civil suit against the<br />\ndistributor of any pornography<br />\nwith which she comes into contact on the grounds that her<br />\npersonhood has been degraded.<br />\nAt first glance, it might seem<br />\nbizarre that enlightened people<br />\nwould get involved with such a<br />\nthing, but sadly enough it is far<br />\ntoo common. Whenever a<br />\ngroup of people holds strong<br />\nviews on a subject, it will be<br />\ntempted to impose its views on<br />\nothers.<br />\nFeminists seem particularly<br />\nsubject to this temptation.<br />\nAlthough they take a libertarian<br />\nposition on the single subject of<br />\nabortion, in many other areas<br />\nthey seem more than willing to<br />\nuse coercion to see their views<br />\nprevail. To give an example<br />\ncloser to home, there was a<br />\nthick air of heavy-handed<br />\ndogmatism at the recent ad hoc<br />\n<br />\nmeeting to discuss \"Violation<br />\nof Women's Civil Rights on<br />\nCampus.\" Jennifer Kidd<br />\nreports that her opinions were<br />\ngreeted with the suggestion that<br />\nshe \"walk around Mudd Hall<br />\nlate at night and get raped,\"<br />\nwhile another person was gently informed that \"this is a<br />\ndemocratic meeting, so sit<br />\ndown and shut up!\"<br />\nThe central question raised<br />\nby the TEP newsletter incident<br />\nis the following: do people have<br />\na right to contemplate and<br />\nprivately<br />\ncommunicate<br />\nthoughts which, were they to<br />\nbecome publicly known, would<br />\noffend a great many people?<br />\nThe answer is, \"Of course!\"<br />\nPeople have the right to think<br />\nwhatever they please. It may be<br />\nprotested that there is an intimate relation between thought<br />\nand action. While this is certainly true, it in no way obviates<br />\nthe fact that there is a grave difference between attempting to<br />\npolice thoughts and ideas and<br />\nattempting to police physical<br />\nactions.

These are substances<br />\nwith enormous potential in the<br />\ntreatment of a wide range of<br />\ndiseases.<br />\nThe new production method<br />\nwas developed by Solomon H.<br />\nSnyder, M.D., director of<br />\nneuroscience, Matthew M.S.<br />\nLo,Ph.D., research associate in<br />\nneuroscience, Tian Yow Tsong,<br />\nPh.D., associate professor of<br />\nphysiological chemistry, Lynda<br />\nD. Hester, neuroscience technician, and Mary Conrad and<br />\nStephen Strittmatter, students<br />\nat the School of Medicine.<br />\nMonoclonal antibodies are<br />\nproduced by cells that scientists<br />\nengineer by fusing two types of<br />\ncells. These are B lymphocytes,<br />\nB-cells for short, and myeloma<br />\ncells. B-cells are the body's own<br />\ndisease-fighting white blood<br />\ncells. Myeloma cells are cancer<br />\ncells. The fused cells are called<br />\n\"hybridomas.\"<br />\nNormal B-cells continually<br />\npatrol the body, searching for<br />\ndisease-causing organisms.<br />\nWhen they encounter such an<br />\ninvader, they produce antibodies, proteins that bind to<br />\n<br />\nsubstances on the invader's surface, immobilizing the<br />\norganism and tagging it for<br />\nlater destruction by other<br />\ndisease-fighting cells.<br />\nThe hybridoma also produces antibodies; due to its<br />\ntumor cell parentage, it can do<br />\nso in much greater quantities.<br />\nAnother advantage of the<br />\nhybridoma is that it can be<br />\ntailored to produce only one<br />\nkind of antibody. This facilitates the identification or<br />\ndestruction of minute quantities<br />\nof a foreign organism or toxin<br />\n<br />\nin the body.<br />\nScientists hope to be able to<br />\nattach anti-cancer drugs to<br />\nmonoclonals. The antibodies<br />\nwould then be able to fight the<br />\ntumor cells in the body while<br />\nsparing healthy, normal ones.<br />\nBefore the development of<br />\nthis new method of production,<br />\nhybridomas were made by<br />\ncoating the parent B and<br />\nmyeloma cells with polyethylene glycol which makes the<br />\ncells \"sticky\" and weakens<br />\ntheir surrounding membranes.<br />\nAny B cells and myeloma cells<br />\n<br />\nSolomon H. Snyder, M.D., Director of Neuroscience<br />\n<br />\nthat then come in contact with<br />\neach other would cling to each<br />\nother; the cells' contents would<br />\nmingle through the weak spots.<br />\nThe problem with this old<br />\nmethod is that scientists have<br />\nno way to control the number<br />\nof cells that fuse. Thus, they are<br />\noften left with clusters of four<br />\nor five cells that have no useful<br />\nfunction.<br />\nThe new, more elegant<br />\nmethod, developed by the<br />\nHopkins team, involves exposing B-cells to proteins against<br />\nwhich the cells make antibodies. B-cells first bind to<br />\nforeign substances, them make<br />\nantibodies against them. The<br />\nscientists also attach the<br />\nchemical biotin to the surface<br />\nof myeloma cells. These groups<br />\nof altered cells are then mixed.<br />\nThe protein bound to the B-cell<br />\nand the biotin on the myeloma<br />\ncell then bind, linking the two<br />\ncells together.<br />\nAn electric current is sent<br />\nthrough the cell mixture,<br />\n\"knocking\" the two cells<br />\ntogether and at the same time<br />\ncausing small holes to appear in<br />\n\u2022 their membranes. The cells'<br />\ncontents then flow through the<br />\nholes, mixing together and<br />\ncausing the two cells to become<br />\n<br />\nJHM1<br />\n<br />\nMosley Returns to Public Health<br />\nW.

The College Republicans also work offcampus with the Maryland<br />\nG.O.P. and are providing pollwatchers for election day.<br />\nCobb recalls that in 1980<br />\n\"the club was also very busy.\"<br />\nHowever, there was some<br />\ndisunity.<br />\nThe<br />\nCollege<br />\nRepublicans' support was split<br />\nbetween two Presidential candidates, John Anderson and<br />\nRonald Reagan. It seems that<br />\nthere was a more liberal ap-<br />\n<br />\nproach to conservatism among<br />\ncollege students in the 1980<br />\nelection year. Cobb states that<br />\nhe personally has become more<br />\nliberal after four years of college. \"Students are generally<br />\nmore liberal,\" says Cobb. \"But<br />\nthe rock-bottom issue is the<br />\neconomy.\" According to<br />\nCobb, today's student's basic<br />\nconcern is finding a job after<br />\ngraduation, and he tends to feel<br />\nthat President Reagan is better<br />\nqualified to stimulate the<br />\neconomy and create those new<br />\njobs.<br />\nCobb also says that,<br />\nalthough students are more<br />\nliberal than the Republican<br />\nParty, he feels that their opinion of the platform is not that<br />\ncritical. \"The platform is important to party ideology.\" According to Cobb, there are<br />\nsome legitimate concerns.<br />\n\"There are about 1-11<br />\n/<br />\n2 million<br />\nabortions in this country,\"<br />\nCobb commented. \"And that<br />\nshould be less.\"<br />\nDavid Biderman, President<br />\nof the Young Democrats, differs from Cobb when he suggests that the rightism of college<br />\ncampuses is temporary.<br />\nHowever, he states, \"The new<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\n<br />\nPoll<br />\n<br />\nire exposed to the issues there'<br />\ns no legitimate reason for a colege student to support<br />\nZeagan.\"<br />\nAccording to the Young<br />\nDemocrats, Reagan's policies<br />\nregarding financial aid are antistudent. Biderman also states<br />\nthat there is no real trend<br />\ntoward conservatism among<br />\nyoung people. Anything that<br />\nthe \"media\" is labelling as a<br />\n\"movement\" is \"nefarious.<br />\nThere is no real student attraction to Reagan and I am sure<br />\nthese mock elections will prove<br />\nthat.

Such<br />\na potentially explosive situation<br />\nactually developed just a short<br />\ntime ago, after the last debate,<br />\nin Las Vegas, Nevada. There<br />\nhave been no reports by any<br />\npart of the news media of this<br />\nrather bizarre encounter<br />\nbecause both campaign staffs<br />\nplanned in advance elaborate<br />\ncover-up ploys to allow their<br />\nrespective candidates to enjoy a<br />\nmuch needed day of mental<br />\nrelaxation (it had been eight<br />\ngrueling days of serious campaigning since Sunday's debate)<br />\nas well as to engage in a little<br />\nstumping among those wild and<br />\nwealthy voters who claim some<br />\nsort of residence in Nevada.<br />\nThe relaxing and stumping,<br />\nthough, were done completely<br />\nundercover, to avoid local<br />\nmedia attention, while official<br />\nstatements were released to the<br />\npress informing us that 1)President Reagan was very busy<br />\nmaking crucial policy decisions<br />\nin the White House and was not<br />\nto be disturbed (\"It's fun to be<br />\non T.V., but sometimes you<br />\nhave to be a President, too),<br />\n<br />\nand that 2) Walter Mondale<br />\nwas in Minnesota, sick in bed<br />\nwith the Norwegian Flu.<br />\nThe disguises that had to be<br />\nworn in Las Vegas posed no<br />\nproblems for either candidate:<br />\nRonnie merely had to refrain<br />\nfrom applying his Grecian<br />\nfromula for a couple days and<br />\nWalter, of course, never travels<br />\nanywhere without his make-up<br />\nman. An old wig and some<br />\nclothes he borrowed from<br />\nGerry completed the former<br />\nvice-president's disguise. When<br />\nasked by a staff aid why he<br />\nchose to masquerade as a<br />\nwoman, Mondale replied, \"I'm<br />\npracticing for Halloween.\"<br />\nFate drew Reagan and Mondale ever closer on this<br />\nmemorable occasion as they<br />\nboth decided to start the day by<br />\nshooting a little craps, thinking<br />\nthat it would be a nice way to<br />\nbreak in their disguises. It was<br />\nhighly improbable, of course,<br />\nthat the two candidates should<br />\nchoose the same craps table in<br />\nthe same casino that morning,<br />\nbut evidently God (the author)<br />\nwas determined to have a little<br />\nfun. The scenario around the<br />\ncraps table when it opened at<br />\n7:00 a.m. consisted of twelve<br />\nJapanese<br />\ntwo<br />\npeople:<br />\nbusinessmen who argued loudly in Japanese over the best way<br />\nto steal the briefcase of the IBM<br />\nexecutive who stood across the<br />\ntable; Senator Gary Hart, who<br />\nwas trying to win enough to pay<br />\nhis campaign debts; Col.<br />\nMuammar Qaddafi, who was<br />\n<br />\ncompletely unrecognizable<br />\nwithout his dark glasses, which,<br />\nincidentally had been purloined and were being worn by the<br />\ndistinguished, elderly whitehaired gentleman standing next<br />\nto him, who, in turn, was standing next to a blond lady with<br />\nbaggy eyes who seemed a bit<br />\nsnug in her otherwise<br />\nremarkably tasteful dress; a<br />\nKGB agent who was on two<br />\ndays leave and was sampling<br />\nsome of the worst of decadent<br />\nAmerican life so that he could<br />\nconvince himself of the<br />\nsuperiority of Marxist idealogy;<br />\nBetty Friedan, whom everyone<br />\nignored; Uncle Jed and Daisy<br />\nMae; and a tall, sinister looking stranger who appeared<br />\nsuspicious of everybody, and<br />\nwho was recognized only by the<br />\nKGB agent. The house was adequately represented by Richard<br />\nDawson, who couldn't understand why the baggy-eyed lady<br />\nkept shoving him away<br />\nwhenever he leaned in for a<br />\nquick smack.<br />\nThe craps game quickly<br />\ndeveloped into a duel between<br />\nthe Japanese and Gary Hart for<br />\nthe highest betters, though<br />\nQaddafi seemed to be the only<br />\nconsistent winner. The biggest<br />\nloser was the KGB agent, for he<br />\nwas terrible at the game, but his<br />\nshrieks of laughter and shouted<br />\nattempts to influence the dice<br />\ncould be heard clear down to<br />\nthe Black Jack tables, requiring<br />\nthe occasional brandishing of<br />\nDaisy Mae's slingshot to<br />\n<br />\ntemper them. The old man with<br />\nthe glasses and the baggy-eyed<br />\nlady standing next to him also<br />\nseemed to play with increasing<br />\nenthusiasm. In fact, it was<br />\nwhen the former made a casual<br />\nremark during the excitement<br />\nof the game that the presidential campaign experienced a<br />\ndramatic and unexpected<br />\nbreakthrough, exposing the<br />\ntrue nature of both candidates.<br />\n\"This is the life, isn't it?

According to the<br />\nCUS proposal, \"the Hopkins<br />\nintersession program has<br />\nalways been somewhat ad hoc<br />\nwith faculty teaching only when<br />\nthey so desired and certainly<br />\nwith little or no encouragement<br />\non the part of the university.\"<br />\n\"I think that what we're seeing is that intersession is becoming a Council priority, a CUS<br />\npriority,\" said Student Council<br />\nPresident Jon Lana. \"It's only at places that have made in-<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nstitutional commitments to<br />\nsimilar programs that they in<br />\nfact work. Hopkins at present<br />\ndoesn't have an institutional<br />\ncommitment, and I think many<br />\npeople believe there should be<br />\none.\"<br />\nThe CUS and the Education<br />\nCommittee made several suggestions for improving the program. Current department offerings could be expanded, the<br />\nproposal notes, allowing faculty to teach new material not included in semester courses.<br />\n\"We want to encourage<br />\nfaculty to teach different<br />\ncourses\u2014not teach just the<br />\nsame things they teach all the<br /><br />\ntime,\" said Komisky.<br />\nSince many professors use intersession to conduct research,<br />\nhe said, faculty members might<br />\ninvolve students in their projects or teach courses about<br />\nthem. \"There are a lot of areas<br />\nin which this could be done,\"<br />\nhe said. \"I think the professors<br />\nwould enjoy something like<br />\nthat, and I'm sure the students<br />\nwould as well.\"<br />\nIn addition, intersession<br />\ncould be an opportunity for<br />\nstudents to take timeconsuming programs like computer courses or intensive<br />\nlanguage courses which they<br />\ncould not take otherwise.<br /><br />\n\"I took [a computer course]<br />\nduring the summer and had to<br />\nspend about 16 hours a week on<br />\nit,\" said Paul Kadri,<br />\nSophomore Class Representative. \"I don't have that time<br />\nduring the year, but I think<br />\npeople would have time during<br />\nintersession. Also, since not as<br />\nmany people would be around,<br />\nit would be easier to find a free<br />\nterminal.\"<br />\nThe CUS also suggested including \"social and cultural<br />\nprograms,\" such as speaker<br />\nseries, film festivals, and short<br />\ntrips, in the intersession<br />\nprogram.<br />\nCouncil Secretary Greg<br /><br />\nWeinstock maintained that<br />\nthese programs should only be<br />\nsupplementary to the intersession curriculum, however.<br />\n\"Lectures should be used to<br />\nembellish the program, but the<br />\ncore must still be regular<br />\ncourses,\" he said.<br />\nLana stressed that supporting the CUS proposal was only a firat step, and that a continuing effort is needed to improve the program.\"I don't expect a sudden transition in the<br />\nnext year,\" he said, \"but I<br />\nthink once we get the program<br />\nreally going, it will start to get<br />\nsome momentum .\"<br /><br />\nYE AQ1300K<br /><br />\nSeniors!<br />\nThis is your last chance for portraits.<br />\nMon.-Fri., November 5-9, 9 am to 5 pm<br />\nCall 338-7790 if you haven't received an appointment or want to change one.<br /><br />\nLAST CHANCE FOR YEARBOOK AT $15.75<br /><br />\nGetthejump with<br />\nTheLong Distance<br />\nWinner<br />\nDavey Croakett got the jump on the<br />\ncompetition by leaping farther than<br />\nany other frog-20 feet 3 inches at<br />\nthe annual Calaveras Jumping<br />\nJubilee at Angels Camp in<br />\nCalifornia in May1976.<br /><br />\nAT&amp;T gets the jump on the<br />\ncompetition, too, so you'll get<br />\nmore mileage for your money.

Carey<br />\nThomas Women's Center sponsored a seminar concerned with<br />\nthe issue of sexual assault and<br />\nharassment. Although the<br />\nseminar dealt mainly with the<br />\nproblem of sexual harassment<br />\non college campuses, Andrea<br />\nBunster, from the University of<br />\nPennsylvania, began with a<br />\nbrief classification of violence<br />\nin general against women.<br />\nThe three forms of this<br />\nviolence are rape, prostitution,<br />\nand institutionalized violence.<br />\nShe described the latter<br />\ncategory as being prevalent<br />\nprimarily in Latin America and<br />\nand<br />\nworld<br />\nthird<br />\nthe<br />\nunderdeveloped countries.<br />\n\"This situation arises when<br />\ngovernment members produce<br />\nand ferment violence against<br />\nwomen,\" explained Bunster.<br />\nAddressing the main issue of<br />\ncampus sexual harassment was<br />\nRuth Wells, also from the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania.<br />\nWells, a former policewoman<br />\nwith the Philadelphia department of police, is presently<br />\nworking with the security personnel at Pennsylvania.

The woman had<br />\nbeen intoxicated and some<br />\nmembers of the community felt<br />\nthat she got what she deserved.<br />\nFemale students were outraged upon hearing these sentiments. They were incensed by<br />\nthe fact that a male student<br />\nwould have helped a fellow<br />\nmale student who was intoxicated, but in the case of a<br />\nfemale student in the same<br />\nsituation, they chose to victimize her.<br />\nThe women's center demanded that immediate action be<br />\ntaken. As a result, all social activities of the fraternity were<br />\nsuspended for a year and the<br />\nmen involved were punished.<br />\nWells used this situaton to<br />\ndescribe the widespread acceptance and socialization of<br />\nassault. \"Some of the men I<br />\ntalked with were unaware that<br />\nthis assault constituted a<br />\ncriminal offense,\" said Wells.<br />\nA film entitled \"The Party<br />\nGame\" was the next feature of<br />\nthe seminar. The film depicted<br />\nthe fairly common situation of<br />\na woman who has recently<br />\nbroken up with her boyfriend,<br />\ngoes alone to a party, and meets<br /><br />\na man she knows nothing about<br />\nHe persuades her to leave the<br />\nparty and takes her to a<br />\ndeserted place. She wants to<br />\nreturn to the others, but he<br />\nwon't let her leave. When she<br />\nresists him, he rapes her.<br />\nThe film concluded at this<br />\npoint and Wells encouraged<br />\nobservations from the audience. One student expressed<br />\na somewhat common feeling:<br />\n\"The scenes are too close for<br />\ncomfort.\"<br />\nAnother said, \"The girl was<br />\ntoo naive and trusting.\" One of<br />\nthe men in the audience continued, \"The man is primarily<br />\nat fault. His actions represent<br />\nthe attitude that women are objects. He obviously had a very<br />\nlow opinion of women.\"<br />\nThe situation was described<br />\nas a result of two people following role models. The woman<br />\nwas trying to please the man,<br />\nand the man was adhering to a<br />\nstereotype.<br />\nThe problem arose not only<br />\nfrom her naivete and his aggressiveness, but also from their<br />\nlack of communication and<br />\nmutual understanding. One student addressed the problem of<br />\ncommunication between the<br />\nwoman ahd her friends: \"They<br />\nlooked on but didn't know<br />\nwhen was the right time to intervene and help her out.\"<br />\nWells continued with another<br />\nexample of sexual assault, this<br />\ntime in a dormitory.

The panel found that<br />\nthere is an \"urgent need for improvement\"<br />\nin providing a general basis of knowledge for<br />\npre-med and medical students.<br />\nDr. Steven Muller, panel chairman and<br />\npresident of the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\ncommented,\"We perceive a continuing erosion of general education for physicians, an<br />\nerosion that has not been arrested but is instead accelerating.\"<br />\nWe agree, but such analysis should not be<br />\nrestricted to premedical and medical<br />\nstudents, or even to preprofessional students.<br />\nEvery student should have a broad-based<br />\neducation and should be encouraged to participate in independent learning outside of<br />\nhis major field of study.<br />\nThis philosophy is sound but it is unlikely that any new developments will be introduced until some time in the future. We<br />\nmust currently concentrate on strengthening<br />\nexisting resources to accomplish these goals.<br />\nInterest in the Intersession program at<br />\nJohns Hopkins has been suffering an unfortunate decline over the past few years. The<br />\naverage enrollment in Intersession courses is<br />\napproximately 19%, with over half of the<br />\nstudents participating in research or independent study. This fact is surprising since other<br /><br />\nschools with non-mandatory Intersessionlike programs, such as Oberlin and<br />\nHamilton, can boast enrollments of over<br />\n7007o. It is also disheartening, since Intersession is a period in which students may explore novel subjects without the pressure of<br />\nthe traditional semester system.<br />\nThe Committee on Undergraduate Studies<br />\nhas suggested that the weakness of the<br />\nHopkins program may be traced to two<br />\nrelated causes.<br />\n\"The first is that the program has<br />\nhistorically received no commitment, dollarwise or energywise, from the University, and<br />\nso is dependent entirely on the altruism of<br />\nfaculty or the persuasiveness of undergraduates for its academic composition.<br />\n\"The second, directly derived from the<br />\nfirst, is that students' attitudes are so<br />\nnegative about the current program that they<br />\nare inclined to look upon Intersession more<br />\nas a burden than an opportunity.\"<br />\nThus, the Johns Hopkins University is<br />\nfailing to take advantage of a resource which<br />\ncould potentially alleviate \"the continuing<br />\nerosion of general education.\"<br />\nThe program must be strengthened. Professors should be paid for courses they teach.<br />\nAssistant professors should be required to<br />\nteach Intersession courses and the administration should take such activity into<br />\naccount when determining tenure. Basic<br />\nsurvey courses as well as upper division<br />\ncourses should be made more available.<br />\nPerhaps then enough interest will be<br />\ngenerated in the program to defend its<br />\nexistence.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nSexism<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nI would like to point out to<br />\nthe women of this campus who<br />\nthink sexual harassment is not<br />\na serious problem unlike rape<br />\nwhich is a \"serious, violent<br />\ncrime and should not be treated<br />\nas sexual harassment,\" that<br />\nthey both spawn from the same<br />\nproblem: the subjugation of<br />\nwomen. Rape is not a crime of<br />\npassion, but one of power, used to enforce the will, and<br />\nthereby keep the victims in a<br />\nsubordinate role; it perpetuates<br />\nthe rigid hierarchy in society.<br />\nSimilarly, to sexually harass<br />\nand then accuse the women of<br />\nbeing \"uppity\" because they<br />\ndemand to be treated with<br />\nrespect inherent to a human bein tz is a power play.<br />\nAnother point for the women<br />\nof th undergraduate community to consider is that this issue<br />\nof sexism may not be important<br />\nnow, because it doesn't bring<br />\nup your G. P. A. or ensure you a<br />\nbetter job, but how important<br />\nwill it be to you when you are<br />\ndenied a job you're qualified<br />\nfor, not given equal pay or sexually harassed by a superior?<br />\nThe time to start caring is now.<br /><br />\nThe issue is important and it affects every member of the<br />\nHomewood community. This is<br />\nnot to say that we are fighting<br />\nagainst the frats on campus<br />\nwhich many people, not including the Women's Center<br />\nhave taken it to mean. As a<br />\nmember of a sorority I am not<br />\nsuggesting we fight the Greek<br />\nsystem, but sexism wherever it<br />\nis occurring.<br />\nBeth Wallen<br /><br />\nFuture Doctors<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nHopkins prides itself on the<br />\ncultivation of many \"fine<br />\nyoung men and women\" who<br />\nwill be our future doctors.<br />\nThese are the people who will<br />\nspend their lives treating and<br />\ncounseling patients on the care<br />\nof their bodies.<br />\nIt is frightening that the same<br />\nwriter of the notorious TEP<br />\nnewsletter, a pre-med, finds<br />\nhumor in the physical abuse of<br />\nwomen. That the violation happens to be sexual, and the victimized female is secondary.<br />\nOne would expect that a future<br />\ndoctor, if anyone, would foster<br />\ngreat respect for the human<br /><br />\nbody. After all, he/she will<br />\ndedicate many years and dollars<br />\nto studying it. The TEP<br />\nnewsletter proves that the<br />\nwriter's respect for it, however,<br />\nis almost as low as his<br />\nintelligence.<br />\nThe most painful aspect\u2014no<br />\npun intended\u2014of his subsequent apology to women is his<br />\ninability to express himself.<br />\nSome people's opinions are<br />\nnever palatable no matter how<br />\nengagingly they are phrased,<br />\nbut a degree of familiarity with<br />\nthe English language is essential<br />\nwhen one proposes to address,<br />\nand to sway, and entire community. the writer would have<br />\nargued his case more convincingly and more literately had he<br />\nremained mute. His incredibly<br />\nverbose and convoluted effort<br />\nto express himself did not<br />\nenlighten the reader as to the<br />\nimplications of his act, nor did<br />\nit clarify and factualize points.<br />\nPre-meds constitute a fairly<br />\nlarge membership of TEP.<br />\nPerhaps previous jokes of this<br />\nnature encouraged the writer to<br />\nfeel that his letter would be accepted and appreciated by his<br />\npeers.<br />\nWe agree that the issue is an<br />\noffense to women. But more<br />\nimportant is the irony of it all:<br /><br />\nHere we have the treatment of<br />\nan incident of sadistic bodily<br />\nabuse as the subject for humor<br />\nand entertainment by a group<br />\nof<br />\nadvantaged<br />\npreprofessionals.<br />\nPerhaps Hopkins should<br />\nreexamine the reputation upon<br />\nwhich it rides.

A<br />\n\"satirical joke\" such as the<br />\nTEP \"Newsletter\" is simply a<br />\nmuted form of rape. Second,<br />\nwomen must assert their dignity and worth. This means refusing to excuse their friend or<br />\nboyfriend if he participates in<br />\nthe defamation and degradation of women. A woman who<br />\nrespected herself would not defend her boyfriend if he wrote<br />\nsomething like the TEP<br />\n\"Newsletter,\" she would tell<br />\nhim it was a frightening revelation of his basest nature.<br />\nWomen on campus should<br />\nnot let the fraternities push<br />\nthem around.

There seems to be a growing pattern of intolerance in<br />\nprecisely those circles where one<br />\nmight least expect to find it. For<br />\nexample, in several states,<br />\nfeminist groups (such as<br />\nWomen Against Pornography)<br />\nhave formed alliances with the<br />\nMoral Majority and other farright organizations in an attempt to legislate sweeping bans<br />\non pornography. The law most<br />\nfrequently proposed by the<br />\nfeminists would allow a woman<br />\nto bring civil suit against the<br />\ndistributor of any pornography<br />\nwith which she comes into contact on the grounds that her<br />\npersonhood has been degraded.<br />\nAt first glance, it might seem<br />\nbizarre that enlightened people<br />\nwould get involved with such a<br />\nthing, but sadly enough it is far<br />\ntoo common.

To give an example<br />\ncloser to home, there was a<br />\nthick air of heavy-handed<br />\ndogmatism at the recent ad hoc<br /><br />\nmeeting to discuss \"Violation<br />\nof Women's Civil Rights on<br />\nCampus.\" Jennifer Kidd<br />\nreports that her opinions were<br />\ngreeted with the suggestion that<br />\nshe \"walk around Mudd Hall<br />\nlate at night and get raped,\"<br />\nwhile another person was gently informed that \"this is a<br />\ndemocratic meeting, so sit<br />\ndown and shut up!\"<br />\nThe central question raised<br />\nby the TEP newsletter incident<br />\nis the following: do people have<br />\na right to contemplate and<br />\nprivately<br />\ncommunicate<br />\nthoughts which, were they to<br />\nbecome publicly known, would<br />\noffend a great many people?<br />\nThe answer is, \"Of course!\"<br />\nPeople have the right to think<br />\nwhatever they please. It may be<br />\nprotested that there is an intimate relation between thought<br />\nand action. While this is certainly true, it in no way obviates<br />\nthe fact that there is a grave difference between attempting to<br />\npolice thoughts and ideas and<br />\nattempting to police physical<br />\nactions. Though the latter is absolutely necessary, the former is<br />\ndangerous indeed.<br />\nMost people on campus, including myself, agree with both<br />\nthe Women's Center's position<br />\nand proposals concerning sexual harassment, but this has<br />\nnothing to do with TEP's<br />\nnewsletter.

These are substances<br />\nwith enormous potential in the<br />\ntreatment of a wide range of<br />\ndiseases.<br />\nThe new production method<br />\nwas developed by Solomon H.<br />\nSnyder, M.D., director of<br />\nneuroscience, Matthew M.S.<br />\nLo,Ph.D., research associate in<br />\nneuroscience, Tian Yow Tsong,<br />\nPh.D., associate professor of<br />\nphysiological chemistry, Lynda<br />\nD. Hester, neuroscience technician, and Mary Conrad and<br />\nStephen Strittmatter, students<br />\nat the School of Medicine.<br />\nMonoclonal antibodies are<br />\nproduced by cells that scientists<br />\nengineer by fusing two types of<br />\ncells. These are B lymphocytes,<br />\nB-cells for short, and myeloma<br />\ncells. B-cells are the body's own<br />\ndisease-fighting white blood<br />\ncells. Myeloma cells are cancer<br />\ncells. The fused cells are called<br />\n\"hybridomas.\"<br />\nNormal B-cells continually<br />\npatrol the body, searching for<br />\ndisease-causing organisms.<br />\nWhen they encounter such an<br />\ninvader, they produce antibodies, proteins that bind to<br /><br />\nsubstances on the invader's surface, immobilizing the<br />\norganism and tagging it for<br />\nlater destruction by other<br />\ndisease-fighting cells.<br />\nThe hybridoma also produces antibodies; due to its<br />\ntumor cell parentage, it can do<br />\nso in much greater quantities.<br />\nAnother advantage of the<br />\nhybridoma is that it can be<br />\ntailored to produce only one<br />\nkind of antibody. This facilitates the identification or<br />\ndestruction of minute quantities<br />\nof a foreign organism or toxin<br /><br />\nin the body.<br />\nScientists hope to be able to<br />\nattach anti-cancer drugs to<br />\nmonoclonals. The antibodies<br />\nwould then be able to fight the<br />\ntumor cells in the body while<br />\nsparing healthy, normal ones.<br />\nBefore the development of<br />\nthis new method of production,<br />\nhybridomas were made by<br />\ncoating the parent B and<br />\nmyeloma cells with polyethylene glycol which makes the<br />\ncells \"sticky\" and weakens<br />\ntheir surrounding membranes.<br />\nAny B cells and myeloma cells<br /><br />\nSolomon H. Snyder, M.D., Director of Neuroscience<br /><br />\nthat then come in contact with<br />\neach other would cling to each<br />\nother; the cells' contents would<br />\nmingle through the weak spots.<br />\nThe problem with this old<br />\nmethod is that scientists have<br />\nno way to control the number<br />\nof cells that fuse. Thus, they are<br />\noften left with clusters of four<br />\nor five cells that have no useful<br />\nfunction.<br />\nThe new, more elegant<br />\nmethod, developed by the<br />\nHopkins team, involves exposing B-cells to proteins against<br />\nwhich the cells make antibodies. B-cells first bind to<br />\nforeign substances, them make<br />\nantibodies against them. The<br />\nscientists also attach the<br />\nchemical biotin to the surface<br />\nof myeloma cells. These groups<br />\nof altered cells are then mixed.<br />\nThe protein bound to the B-cell<br />\nand the biotin on the myeloma<br />\ncell then bind, linking the two<br />\ncells together.<br />\nAn electric current is sent<br />\nthrough the cell mixture,<br />\n\"knocking\" the two cells<br />\ntogether and at the same time<br />\ncausing small holes to appear in<br />\n\u2022 their membranes.

Cobb states that<br />\nhe personally has become more<br />\nliberal after four years of college. \"Students are generally<br />\nmore liberal,\" says Cobb. \"But<br />\nthe rock-bottom issue is the<br />\neconomy.\" According to<br />\nCobb, today's student's basic<br />\nconcern is finding a job after<br />\ngraduation, and he tends to feel<br />\nthat President Reagan is better<br />\nqualified to stimulate the<br />\neconomy and create those new<br />\njobs.<br />\nCobb also says that,<br />\nalthough students are more<br />\nliberal than the Republican<br />\nParty, he feels that their opinion of the platform is not that<br />\ncritical. \"The platform is important to party ideology.\" According to Cobb, there are<br />\nsome legitimate concerns.<br />\n\"There are about 1-11<br />\n/<br />\n2 million<br />\nabortions in this country,\"<br />\nCobb commented. \"And that<br />\nshould be less.\"<br />\nDavid Biderman, President<br />\nof the Young Democrats, differs from Cobb when he suggests that the rightism of college<br />\ncampuses is temporary.<br />\nHowever, he states, \"The new<br /><br />\nNews-Letter<br /><br />\nPoll<br /><br />\nire exposed to the issues there'<br />\ns no legitimate reason for a colege student to support<br />\nZeagan.\"<br />\nAccording to the Young<br />\nDemocrats, Reagan's policies<br />\nregarding financial aid are antistudent.

Such<br />\na potentially explosive situation<br />\nactually developed just a short<br />\ntime ago, after the last debate,<br />\nin Las Vegas, Nevada. There<br />\nhave been no reports by any<br />\npart of the news media of this<br />\nrather bizarre encounter<br />\nbecause both campaign staffs<br />\nplanned in advance elaborate<br />\ncover-up ploys to allow their<br />\nrespective candidates to enjoy a<br />\nmuch needed day of mental<br />\nrelaxation (it had been eight<br />\ngrueling days of serious campaigning since Sunday's debate)<br />\nas well as to engage in a little<br />\nstumping among those wild and<br />\nwealthy voters who claim some<br />\nsort of residence in Nevada.<br />\nThe relaxing and stumping,<br />\nthough, were done completely<br />\nundercover, to avoid local<br />\nmedia attention, while official<br />\nstatements were released to the<br />\npress informing us that 1)President Reagan was very busy<br />\nmaking crucial policy decisions<br />\nin the White House and was not<br />\nto be disturbed (\"It's fun to be<br />\non T.V., but sometimes you<br />\nhave to be a President, too),<br /><br />\nand that 2) Walter Mondale<br />\nwas in Minnesota, sick in bed<br />\nwith the Norwegian Flu.<br />\nThe disguises that had to be<br />\nworn in Las Vegas posed no<br />\nproblems for either candidate:<br />\nRonnie merely had to refrain<br />\nfrom applying his Grecian<br />\nfromula for a couple days and<br />\nWalter, of course, never travels<br />\nanywhere without his make-up<br />\nman. An old wig and some<br />\nclothes he borrowed from<br />\nGerry completed the former<br />\nvice-president's disguise. When<br />\nasked by a staff aid why he<br />\nchose to masquerade as a<br />\nwoman, Mondale replied, \"I'm<br />\npracticing for Halloween.\"<br />\nFate drew Reagan and Mondale ever closer on this<br />\nmemorable occasion as they<br />\nboth decided to start the day by<br />\nshooting a little craps, thinking<br />\nthat it would be a nice way to<br />\nbreak in their disguises. It was<br />\nhighly improbable, of course,<br />\nthat the two candidates should<br />\nchoose the same craps table in<br />\nthe same casino that morning,<br />\nbut evidently God (the author)<br />\nwas determined to have a little<br />\nfun. The scenario around the<br />\ncraps table when it opened at<br />\n7:00 a.m. consisted of twelve<br />\nJapanese<br />\ntwo<br />\npeople:<br />\nbusinessmen who argued loudly in Japanese over the best way<br />\nto steal the briefcase of the IBM<br />\nexecutive who stood across the<br />\ntable; Senator Gary Hart, who<br />\nwas trying to win enough to pay<br />\nhis campaign debts; Col.<br />\nMuammar Qaddafi, who was<br /><br />\ncompletely unrecognizable<br />\nwithout his dark glasses, which,<br />\nincidentally had been purloined and were being worn by the<br />\ndistinguished, elderly whitehaired gentleman standing next<br />\nto him, who, in turn, was standing next to a blond lady with<br />\nbaggy eyes who seemed a bit<br />\nsnug in her otherwise<br />\nremarkably tasteful dress; a<br />\nKGB agent who was on two<br />\ndays leave and was sampling<br />\nsome of the worst of decadent<br />\nAmerican life so that he could<br />\nconvince himself of the<br />\nsuperiority of Marxist idealogy;<br />\nBetty Friedan, whom everyone<br />\nignored; Uncle Jed and Daisy<br />\nMae; and a tall, sinister looking stranger who appeared<br />\nsuspicious of everybody, and<br />\nwho was recognized only by the<br />\nKGB agent. The house was adequately represented by Richard<br />\nDawson, who couldn't understand why the baggy-eyed lady<br />\nkept shoving him away<br />\nwhenever he leaned in for a<br />\nquick smack.<br />\nThe craps game quickly<br />\ndeveloped into a duel between<br />\nthe Japanese and Gary Hart for<br />\nthe highest betters, though<br />\nQaddafi seemed to be the only<br />\nconsistent winner. The biggest<br />\nloser was the KGB agent, for he<br />\nwas terrible at the game, but his<br />\nshrieks of laughter and shouted<br />\nattempts to influence the dice<br />\ncould be heard clear down to<br />\nthe Black Jack tables, requiring<br />\nthe occasional brandishing of<br />\nDaisy Mae's slingshot to<br /><br />\ntemper them. The old man with<br />\nthe glasses and the baggy-eyed<br />\nlady standing next to him also<br />\nseemed to play with increasing<br />\nenthusiasm. In fact, it was<br />\nwhen the former made a casual<br />\nremark during the excitement<br />\nof the game that the presidential campaign experienced a<br />\ndramatic and unexpected<br />\nbreakthrough, exposing the<br />\ntrue nature of both candidates.<br />\n\"This is the life, isn't it? It<br />\nis certainly a measure of the<br />\nsuccess and prosperity of<br />\nAmerica that people like us can<br />\nblow hard earned money for<br />\nentertainment. It reminds me of<br />\na story .<br />\n\"Just roll the dice,<br />\nGramps,\" interrupted Qaddafi,<br />\nwho was suspiciously eyeing the<br />\nelderly speaker's shades.<br />\n\"I'm sorry. I could have<br />\ngone on all day.\"<br />\nBut Mondale was determined to have his say before attention strayed from the topic.<br />\n\"But the problem is that most<br />\npeople in America never get to<br />\nshare in this kind of life. This<br />\ngame is a prime example of the<br />\nselfish pleasures of the prosperous few.\"<br />\n\"Would anybody like a copy<br />\nof New Solidarity?\" asked the<br />\ntall stranger quietly to no one<br />\nin particular.<br />\n\"What's more,\" interjected<br />\nMs. Friedan, responding to<br />\nMondale,\"is that of the twelve<br />\nor thirteen people at this table,<br />\nthere are only three women.\"<br />\nNobody listened. Jed and Daisy<br /><br />\nhad already fallen asleep.<br />\nAt this point Hart decided to<br />\njoin in, addressing Mondale,<br />\n\"But, Madam, that is an outdated view which contributed<br />\nto the failed policies of the past.<br />\nWe must be ready to employ a<br />\nnew generation of ideas. The<br />\nDemocrats have no chance this<br />\nyear.
