Each<br />\nteam has taken up its work with<br />\nsuch enthusiasm that new men<br />\nhave been rapidly coming out,anxious for an opportunity to join<br />\ntheir ranks and thereby not only<br />\nabsolve their athletic requirements as under classmen in a very<br />\ninteresting way, but also learn<br />\nsomething about the game, so that<br />\nthey will have an opportunity to<br />\nwin the much coveted \"H\" later<br />\nin their college careers.<br />\nThe old grass tennis courts at<br />\nthe start of the 220 straightaway<br />\nare to be turned into first class<br />\nbasket ball courts, fully equipped,<br />\nso that several games may be<br />\nstaged at one time.

Barchet saved<br />\nthe Black and Blue from a shutout, when in the third quarter he<br />\nbroke away and ran 60 yards for<br />\na touchdown. The game was<br />\nplayed on the home grounds of<br />\nthe Swarthmore team, and because of the large number of outof-town visitors who were there<br />\nfor the Founders' Day celebration the colitest was well attended. The weather, although<br />\ncloudy, was not disagreeable, but<br />\nrecent rains had left the field<br />\nrather slippery, thus giving an<br />\nadvantage to the Swarthmore<br />\nteam, which out-weighed the<br />\nBlack and Blue aggregation.<br />\nThe first scoring of the game<br />\ntook place early in the first quarLarkin, of Swarthmore,<br />\nter.<br />\nkicked Off over the goal, thus giving the ball to Hopkins on her<br />\nown 20-yard line.

Judge<br />\nRose was speaking at the Roosevelt Memorial Meeting held Wednesday, October 22nd in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building, where he<br />\nwas the special speaker. The<br />\nHopkins Memorial meeting was<br />\nmerely one of thousands held<br />\nthroughout the United States last<br />\nweek. The Judge, it will be remembered, was a member of that<br />\ngroup of close friends and councilors of Roosevelt known as the<br />\ntennis cabinet who met the President at tennis (sometimes as<br />\noften as twice a week) on the<br />\ncourts in back of the White<br />\nHouse. Owing to Judge Rose's<br />\nclose personal friendship with our<br />\nlate ex-president he was the one<br />\nman most fitted to address a memorial meeting. The address was<br />\nextremely interesting; the subject,<br />\n\"Roosevelt the College Man\" being developed with many anecdotes and characteristic little<br />\nstories about Roosevelt.<br />\nThe purpose of the Roosevelt<br />\nMemorial Association is to transmit some of his spirit to as many<br />\nAmericans as possible. The Association plans also to erect a<br />\npermanent memorial to Theodore<br />\nRoosevelt in Washington ; to establish a park at Oyster Bay;<br />\nand, through the Woman's Memorial Association, to purchase<br />\nand maintain the house in which<br />\nhe was born in New York City.<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nEXPEDITION PARTY RE1URNS<br />\nProfessors Barry and Singewald Return<br />\nFrom South America- Report Political and Economic Conditions Unstaple.<br />\n<br />\nThe George Huntington Willimps Memorial Expedition to<br />\nSouth America has returned, arriving in New York on Saturday.

Welch, Director of the School<br />\nof Hygiene, the foremost pathologist in the world; and the fourth<br />\nis of Sidney Limier, the most beloved poet of the South.<br />\nThe panels on either side of the<br />\ndoor leading into the main hall<br />\nare inscribed with the names of<br />\nthe Hopkins graduates who established the Alumni Fund of 1910.<br />\nIn the center of the floor is the<br />\nJohns Hopkins seal, the emblem<br />\nof the University for which these<br />\nmen strove to achieve great<br />\nthings, and from whose halls the<br />\nmen, whose names are chiseled in<br />\nthe wall to the right, went out<br />\ninto the battlefields of France and<br />\ndied. Could we not start the custom\u2014with the intention that in a<br />\nfew years it shall become a tradition\u2014of regarding this place as a<br />\nsort of shrine in commemoration<br />\nof the great men and traditions<br />\nof our University, and show our<br />\nreverence for the living and the<br />\ndead by uncovering our heads as<br />\nwe pass through?<br />\nHopkins is still young; its doors<br />\nwere opened on Washington's<br />\nBirthday, 1876, only forty-three<br />\nyears ago. Consequently there has<br />\nhardly been time for many traditions to have taken firm root.<br />\nMoreover, we have been at Homewood hardly four years. Now is<br />\nthe time for us to establish new<br />\ntraditions of which we may be<br />\nproud. Let us establish new records in scholarship, higher standards on the athletic field, bigger<br />\n\u2022 go:foals for vocational achievements.<br />\nBut to come down to concrete<br />\nrealities, let us make it a tradition that we refrain from dirtying<br />\nthe walks and campus with trash<br />\nand cigarette butts, there are<br />\nplenty of receptacles about. There<br />\nare bigger things to leave behind<br />\nus. For example, the graduating<br />\nclass might give new impetus to<br />\nthe tradition of leaving a class<br />\nmemorial. The Class of 1908 left a<br />\nbeautiful sun dial in the botanical<br />\ngardens. There is room for more<br />\nsuch fitting memorials around the<br />\nUniversity. What will the Class<br />\nof 1920 do to fulfill this tradition,<br />\nand perhaps start a new one?<br />\n<br />\nsense of individual obligation to<br />\nthe community, state and nation;<br />\nto combat the autocracy of both<br />\nclasses and masses; to make right<br />\nthe master of might; to promote<br />\npeace and good will on the earth;<br />\nto safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice,<br />\nfree.lom and democracy; to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our devotion to \u2022mutual<br />\nhelpfulness.\" \u2022<br />\nCould any organization be<br />\nformed on higher, nobler principles? Surely Johns Hopkins, with<br />\nher motto \"Veritas Vos Liberabit,\" should have such a unit. You<br />\nHopkins men who have served in<br />\nthe military forces of America<br />\nbear this in mind and when the<br />\nnext meeting is called be there to<br />\nenter your name on the roll.

Many other institutions<br />\nhave a long start on us. The<br />\nstudy of music in various forms<br />\nhas been part of the curriculum<br />\nfor many years in some leading<br />\nuniversities and colleges. Fine<br />\nconcert auditoriums, splendid organs, college choirs, choral societies, symphony<br />\norchestras,<br />\nstring quartets and military<br />\nbands, are becoming recognized as<br />\nessential factors in the equipment<br />\nof modern universities, and music<br />\nis destined to play a great part in<br />\nthe universities of the future.. As<br />\na rule, college courses in music,<br />\norchestral and choral classes, are<br />\nopen to outsiders, as in the case<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins orchestra.<br />\nJohns Hopkins, a leader among<br />\nuniversities of the world, has been<br />\nslow to recognize the greatest, of<br />\nall arts. We have had the usual<br />\nglee, mandolin and banjo clubs,<br />\nsometimes very good ones, and<br />\nwe have had orchestral music at<br />\nthe exercises, furnished by outside musicians. But it was not<br />\nuntil the early part of the present year \u2022 that the University officially recognized music by making an arrangement with the Peabody Conservatory by which work<br />\nin music is accepted from students of the conservatory as a<br />\nmajor study for credit toward the<br />\ndegree of Bachelor of Science, and<br />\n\u2022 by leading encouragement to the<br />\norganization of the Johns Hopkins Musical Association, under<br />\nwhose auspices the orchestra was<br />\nfounded last'January.<br />\nWe have been fortunate in securing the services of Professor<br />\nCharles H. Bkhan, a member of<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory staff.<br />\ndirector of music in the schol for<br />\nthe blind, and director of the orchestra of the Musical Settlement<br />\nSchool. Mr. Bochan is one of the<br />\nmost accomplished and versatile<br />\nmusicians in Baltimore. He has<br />\nhad long experience as a choral<br />\ndirector, choir master and organist, in composition and arranging,<br />\nin military band, orchestral and<br />\nstring quartet playing, and as a<br />\nteacher of singing, piano' and violin. He has the temperament, experience, personal magnetism<br />\nand gift for interpretation, required, of a good conductor.

The first day out two football teams were organized and<br />\nWilliams and B. R. Smith were<br />\nelected to captain them. Each<br />\nteam has taken up its work with<br />\nsuch enthusiasm that new men<br />\nhave been rapidly coming out,anxious for an opportunity to join<br />\ntheir ranks and thereby not only<br />\nabsolve their athletic requirements as under classmen in a very<br />\ninteresting way, but also learn<br />\nsomething about the game, so that<br />\nthey will have an opportunity to<br />\nwin the much coveted \"H\" later<br />\nin their college careers.<br />\nThe old grass tennis courts at<br />\nthe start of the 220 straightaway<br />\nare to be turned into first class<br />\nbasket ball courts, fully equipped,<br />\nso that several games may be<br />\nstaged at one time. The new men<br />\nwho are not interested in football<br />\nwill be organized into basket ball<br />\n'teams and before long one will be<br />\nable to witness a good scrappy<br />\ngame most any afternoon.,<br />\nBut this does not mean that<br />\nfootball and basket ball are to<br />\ntake up all of the time.

Barchet saved<br />\nthe Black and Blue from a shutout, when in the third quarter he<br />\nbroke away and ran 60 yards for<br />\na touchdown. The game was<br />\nplayed on the home grounds of<br />\nthe Swarthmore team, and because of the large number of outof-town visitors who were there<br />\nfor the Founders' Day celebration the colitest was well attended. The weather, although<br />\ncloudy, was not disagreeable, but<br />\nrecent rains had left the field<br />\nrather slippery, thus giving an<br />\nadvantage to the Swarthmore<br />\nteam, which out-weighed the<br />\nBlack and Blue aggregation.<br />\nThe first scoring of the game<br />\ntook place early in the first quarLarkin, of Swarthmore,<br />\nter.<br />\nkicked Off over the goal, thus giving the ball to Hopkins on her<br />\nown 20-yard line. Hopkins was<br />\nunable to gain, and on the third<br />\nplay, McGinley, of Swarthmore,<br />\nfell-on a fumble.<br />\nEarps caned the ball through<br />\nright tackle for a gain of five<br />\nyards, but Carter could not advance through center.<br />\nEarps<br />\nagain took the ball and gained<br />\neight yards, and on the next play<br />\nmade the touchdown.<br />\nCarter<br />\nkicked the goal.

Swarthmore<br />\nmade a first down, and then, because of a 15-yard penalty for<br />\nholding and a bad pass, were<br />\nforced to kick. Hopkins was unable to gain, so Wood again<br />\npunted to Carter, but the latter<br />\ndropped the ball and Hecht fell<br />\non it on the Quakers' 10-yard line.<br />\nHoffman made two -yards through<br />\nright tackle and ..Tome went<br />\nthrough center for five more.

Colonel<br />\nRoosevelt always claimed that<br />\ncollege taught him what not to<br />\ndo, rather than what to do. Judge<br />\nRose was speaking at the Roosevelt Memorial Meeting held Wednesday, October 22nd in the Civil<br />\nEngineering Building, where he<br />\nwas the special speaker. The<br />\nHopkins Memorial meeting was<br />\nmerely one of thousands held<br />\nthroughout the United States last<br />\nweek. The Judge, it will be remembered, was a member of that<br />\ngroup of close friends and councilors of Roosevelt known as the<br />\ntennis cabinet who met the President at tennis (sometimes as<br />\noften as twice a week) on the<br />\ncourts in back of the White<br />\nHouse. Owing to Judge Rose's<br />\nclose personal friendship with our<br />\nlate ex-president he was the one<br />\nman most fitted to address a memorial meeting. The address was<br />\nextremely interesting; the subject,<br />\n\"Roosevelt the College Man\" being developed with many anecdotes and characteristic little<br />\nstories about Roosevelt.<br />\nThe purpose of the Roosevelt<br />\nMemorial Association is to transmit some of his spirit to as many<br />\nAmericans as possible. The Association plans also to erect a<br />\npermanent memorial to Theodore<br />\nRoosevelt in Washington ; to establish a park at Oyster Bay;<br />\nand, through the Woman's Memorial Association, to purchase<br />\nand maintain the house in which<br />\nhe was born in New York City.<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nEXPEDITION PARTY RE1URNS<br />\nProfessors Barry and Singewald Return<br />\nFrom South America- Report Political and Economic Conditions Unstaple.<br /><br />\nThe George Huntington Willimps Memorial Expedition to<br />\nSouth America has returned, arriving in New York on Saturday.

Of colrse, the \"ten<br />\ncommandments,\" which the neophyte must learn to faithfully<br />\nobey before he can become truly<br />\na member of the great Hopkins<br />\nbotherhood, the harmless sophomore freshman wrestling parties,<br />\nwhich have been dignified by the<br />\nname of \"rushes,\" the deft manipulation of paddles to coerce certain freshmen from their selfcentered spheres into the bigger<br />\nHopkins life, the \"serpentines\"<br />\nand unrestrained enthusiasm before and after St. John's and<br />\nMaryland State games, the songs,<br />\nthe yells, the \"Hullabaloo,\" and<br />\nlots of other things, are all Hopkins traditions.<br />\nBut they seem so .insignificant<br />\nin comparison with other traditions which the immortal names<br />\nof Oilman, Remsen, Roland, Gildersleeve and other eminent scholars have established for us in the<br />\nintellectual world. There is one<br />\nsmall way we can honor them<br />\nand other men who have done<br />\ngreat things for Hopkins. In the<br />\nhandsome entrance to Gilman<br />\nHall there stands on marble pedestals the busts of our famous<br />\nmen: one is that of Sir William<br />\nOsler, the professor of medicine<br />\nin the early days of the Medical<br />\nSchool, whose influence on raising<br />\nthe standards of American medicine was paramount and who is<br />\ngoing to present the University<br /><br />\nwith a handsome club library; another is that of John William McCoy, the donor of an art library<br />\nand a large fund for the building<br />\nof McCoy Hall, our former home;<br />\nthe third is that of Dr. William .<br />\nH. Welch, Director of the School<br />\nof Hygiene, the foremost pathologist in the world; and the fourth<br />\nis of Sidney Limier, the most beloved poet of the South.<br />\nThe panels on either side of the<br />\ndoor leading into the main hall<br />\nare inscribed with the names of<br />\nthe Hopkins graduates who established the Alumni Fund of 1910.<br />\nIn the center of the floor is the<br />\nJohns Hopkins seal, the emblem<br />\nof the University for which these<br />\nmen strove to achieve great<br />\nthings, and from whose halls the<br />\nmen, whose names are chiseled in<br />\nthe wall to the right, went out<br />\ninto the battlefields of France and<br />\ndied. Could we not start the custom\u2014with the intention that in a<br />\nfew years it shall become a tradition\u2014of regarding this place as a<br />\nsort of shrine in commemoration<br />\nof the great men and traditions<br />\nof our University, and show our<br />\nreverence for the living and the<br />\ndead by uncovering our heads as<br />\nwe pass through?<br />\nHopkins is still young; its doors<br />\nwere opened on Washington's<br />\nBirthday, 1876, only forty-three<br />\nyears ago. Consequently there has<br />\nhardly been time for many traditions to have taken firm root.<br />\nMoreover, we have been at Homewood hardly four years. Now is<br />\nthe time for us to establish new<br />\ntraditions of which we may be<br />\nproud. Let us establish new records in scholarship, higher standards on the athletic field, bigger<br />\n\u2022 go:foals for vocational achievements.<br />\nBut to come down to concrete<br />\nrealities, let us make it a tradition that we refrain from dirtying<br />\nthe walks and campus with trash<br />\nand cigarette butts, there are<br />\nplenty of receptacles about. There<br />\nare bigger things to leave behind<br />\nus. For example, the graduating<br />\nclass might give new impetus to<br />\nthe tradition of leaving a class<br />\nmemorial. The Class of 1908 left a<br />\nbeautiful sun dial in the botanical<br />\ngardens. There is room for more<br />\nsuch fitting memorials around the<br />\nUniversity. What will the Class<br />\nof 1920 do to fulfill this tradition,<br />\nand perhaps start a new one?<br /><br />\nsense of individual obligation to<br />\nthe community, state and nation;<br />\nto combat the autocracy of both<br />\nclasses and masses; to make right<br />\nthe master of might; to promote<br />\npeace and good will on the earth;<br />\nto safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice,<br />\nfree.lom and democracy; to consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our devotion to \u2022mutual<br />\nhelpfulness.\" \u2022<br />\nCould any organization be<br />\nformed on higher, nobler principles?

Many other institutions<br />\nhave a long start on us. The<br />\nstudy of music in various forms<br />\nhas been part of the curriculum<br />\nfor many years in some leading<br />\nuniversities and colleges. Fine<br />\nconcert auditoriums, splendid organs, college choirs, choral societies, symphony<br />\norchestras,<br />\nstring quartets and military<br />\nbands, are becoming recognized as<br />\nessential factors in the equipment<br />\nof modern universities, and music<br />\nis destined to play a great part in<br />\nthe universities of the future.. As<br />\na rule, college courses in music,<br />\norchestral and choral classes, are<br />\nopen to outsiders, as in the case<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins orchestra.<br />\nJohns Hopkins, a leader among<br />\nuniversities of the world, has been<br />\nslow to recognize the greatest, of<br />\nall arts. We have had the usual<br />\nglee, mandolin and banjo clubs,<br />\nsometimes very good ones, and<br />\nwe have had orchestral music at<br />\nthe exercises, furnished by outside musicians. But it was not<br />\nuntil the early part of the present year \u2022 that the University officially recognized music by making an arrangement with the Peabody Conservatory by which work<br />\nin music is accepted from students of the conservatory as a<br />\nmajor study for credit toward the<br />\ndegree of Bachelor of Science, and<br />\n\u2022 by leading encouragement to the<br />\norganization of the Johns Hopkins Musical Association, under<br />\nwhose auspices the orchestra was<br />\nfounded last'January.<br />\nWe have been fortunate in securing the services of Professor<br />\nCharles H. Bkhan, a member of<br />\nthe Peabody Conservatory staff.<br />\ndirector of music in the schol for<br />\nthe blind, and director of the orchestra of the Musical Settlement<br />\nSchool. Mr. Bochan is one of the<br />\nmost accomplished and versatile<br />\nmusicians in Baltimore. He has<br />\nhad long experience as a choral<br />\ndirector, choir master and organist, in composition and arranging,<br />\nin military band, orchestral and<br />\nstring quartet playing, and as a<br />\nteacher of singing, piano' and violin. He has the temperament, experience, personal magnetism<br />\nand gift for interpretation, required, of a good conductor.
