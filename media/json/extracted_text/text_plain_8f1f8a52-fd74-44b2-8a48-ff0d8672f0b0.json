They<br />\nhave exceptional opportunities for studying<br />\nthe conditions by which they are surrounded,<br />\nand acquire an influence over their neighbors<br />\nwhich it would be impossible to gain in any<br />\nother way.<br />\nWork of this kind was begun in Baltimore<br />\nin 1893, when Rev. Edward A. Lawrence, pastor of the First Congregational Church, and<br />\nMr. E. D. Thomson, of the University, went<br />\nto live in Baltimore's tenement section on Parkin street. Mr. Lawrence died soon after, and<br />\nan association, of which the Hopkins Y. M. C.<br />\nA. is a member, determined to carry on the<br />\nwork in his name. This organization is known<br />\nas the Lawrence Memorial Association, and<br />\nthe house which it now owns is called \"Lawrence House.\" Students of the Woman's College and the young people of the First Congregational and Harlem Avenue Christian<br />\nChurches are also represented in its management.<br />\nIn this house work for the improvement of<br />\nthe boys and girls of the neighborhood is carried on. It is not a religious institution, and<br />\nno religious services are held. Educational<br />\nclasses, manual training and amusements are<br />\nprovided for the boys. There are work<br />\nbenches where they learn to use carpenters'<br />\n,tools, and skilled wood-workers teach them<br />\ncarving., The instruction is all practical, and<br />\ninteresting games and amusements are used<br />\njudiciously. On certain days the house is<br />\nopen for girls. Lessons in cooking strike at<br />\nthe root of false economy in the household,<br />\none of the greatest causes of poverty. In the<br />\nsewing classes girls learn to cut and finish<br />\ntheir own garments, and some are taught to<br />\nembroider. All these efforts, directed at the<br />\nmost impressionable class in the community,<br />\nare wonderfully successful. More boys and<br />\ngirls apply for admission than can be accommodated.<br />\nThe house is not only a means of carrying<br />\non the classes just mentioned, but serves also<br />\nas a model household. The children arc<br />\ntaught how to sweep and dust, make beds, and<br />\n<br />\nmanage the details of housekeeping. The<br />\nwhole building is designed as an object lesson.<br />\nOf late the work has been reaching out in<br />\nboth directions. There is a kindergarten for<br />\nthe little ones, and a savings bank that has<br />\nbeen of much service to the boys will be extended for the use of their elders. Other efforts in behalf of the adults of the neighborhood are contemplated.<br />\nAt present no students lodge in the house.<br />\nIt is being found, generally, in the settlement<br />\nwork, that most students can work more effectively by visiting the houses at regular<br />\nhours, leaving others to give their whole time<br />\nto the field.<br />\nAmong the Hopkins students now engaged<br />\nat Lawrence House are Messrs. H. B. Foster,<br />\nJ. S. Chamberlain, N. A. Kent and H. A.<br />\nHamilton, of the graduate departments, and<br />\nMessrs. Rous, Schermerhorn and J. G. Griffin,<br />\nfrom the undergraduates.<br />\nTHE FIRST MUSICALE.<br />\nThe series of entertainments to be given this<br />\nyear by the Hopkins Musical Association was<br />\nbegun by a delightful concert in McCoy Hall,<br />\non December 10. President Gilman welcomed<br />\nthe guests of the association in a few graceful<br />\nwords at the beginning of the programme.<br />\nThe music was in charge of Mr. Edward<br />\nHeimendahl, who played as the first number<br />\na violin arioso by Julius Reitz, in which he<br />\nwas accompanied on the organ by Mr. G.<br />\nWright Nicols. He played with careful attention to phrasing, being hampered somewhat by an unresponsive accompaniment.<br />\nThis, however, only ac.cented his control over<br />\nthe instrument and his perfect familiarity with<br />\n,the composer. Two trios for sopranos were<br />\nwell sung by the Misses Brown, Carey and<br />\nPagon. The three voices harmonized beautifully, and showed much attention to precision<br />\nin time and expression. The choice of the<br />\nChopin fantasy for piano, played by Miss Hermine Lenders, was possibly injudicious, as it<br />\nlacks sustained interest. The performance<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwas conscientious, and Miss Leuders' technique unquestioned. Dr. Baker sang four<br />\n.,songs by McDowell, artistic little pieces which<br />\nwere , well interpreted, though the singer<br />\nseemed not to be in his best form. The last<br />\nselection, a piano quintet by Schumann, was<br />\nquite successful, considering the importance of<br />\nthe work and the limited time available for rehearsals. The performers were Miss Leuders,<br />\nMessrs. Heimendahl, Moses, Siemann, and<br />\nFuerthermaier.<br />\n<br />\nA WORD FROM THE CHIEF ROOTER.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors Of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nA CLASS ON CURRENT TOPICS.<br />\n<br />\nDr. J. H. Hollander, of the Department of<br />\nHistorical and Political Science, recently revived an interesting course of study on topics<br />\nof current interest in American politics. He<br />\ntakes the Congressional Record and other reports of public proceedings in Washington,<br />\nand discourses on the more important matters<br />\nhorn week to week, with a class of advanced<br />\nstudents. Last year a deep interest was awakened among the students by a similar course,<br />\nand the present conference should be even<br />\nmore successful, in view of the great interest<br />\nnow existing in American colonial and international questions. No better illustration<br />\ncould be desired of the true significance of<br />\nFreeman's motto, \"History is past politics, and<br />\npolitics present history.\" Hopkins students<br />\nshould be abreast of the age in which they are<br />\nto live and work.<br />\n<br />\nThe way the Hopkins men rooted at the St.<br />\nJohn's football game, and, in fact, at all our<br />\ngames last fall, was a disgrace. In the first<br />\nplace, they paid no attention to grouping themselves properly. It is impossible for a crowd<br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS.<br />\nto give the college yell in unison if they continually run up and down the side lines.

Another and the leaders are gratified by the promise<br />\nimportant point is to know the yells. At least they show of a successful season. The men<br />\nhalf the rooters either don't know the yells at were delightfully entertained at supper, and<br />\nall, or don't know how to give them in correct after the concert by Dr. Fletcher and the girls<br />\nmetre.

U.; or box 398, Medical School<br />\nofJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\n<br />\nConditions at Hopkins differ from those<br />\nfound in mostcolleges in that the collegiate and<br />\npost-graduate departments are of about the<br />\nsame size. For this reason outsiders who know<br />\nonly the one or the other frequently get their<br />\nideas of our college life somewhat mixed. Visitors who are familiar with the advanced department alone, often embarrass under-graduates by asking what college they are from,and<br />\nBaltimoreans who get their ideas of us from<br />\nthe daily press wrongfully attribute to the<br />\ngraduates the innocent diversions of their juniors. If the incipient Ph. D.'s will unbend a<br />\nlittle, and the under-graduates take on some<br />\nadded dignity, we shall reach the golden mean<br />\nthat will make our student-body homogeneous.<br />\n<br />\nenemy. Don't ramble about the field, but stay<br />\nwhere you're put and attend to business. We<br />\nhope that Dr. Crenshaw will give the rooters a<br />\nplace in the indoor exhibition. The suggestion of practice in the cage is a good one, and<br />\nshould be taken up. Give the chief rooter a<br />\nshow.<br />\nAfter the Christmas vacation, the season of<br />\nclass banquets will soon be upon us. The<br />\nbanqueters will do well to remember that the<br />\nobject of these gatherings is good-fellowship.<br />\nThe food and drink are incidental features that<br />\ncontribute to that end. A banquet should<br />\nbring the men closer together and cement the<br />\nfriendships that have been forming in classroom and gym. For this purpose the toasts<br />\nand responses are more important than they<br />\nare sometimes considered. A certain degree<br />\nof dignity and decorum are essential, even at a<br />\nfreshman banquet. A risque story that seems<br />\nunobjectionable in a group of two or three,<br />\nmay be in very bad taste when delivered to a<br />\nlarger company. Over-abundant enthusiasm<br />\nthat disregards the rights of others soon becomes a nuisance.<br />\n<br />\nThe Senate of the Johns Hopkins University seems determined to imitate its archetype<br />\nin more ways than one. It has developed a<br />\ngreat facility in wasting time over unimportant<br />\npoints, and often shows a decided lack of interest when debate is in order. We fear that the<br />\nSenators do not take themselves seriously<br />\nenough. They rely on inadequate preparation for speeches, because the time for debate<br />\nis short. Those who follow the first speaker<br />\nIn another column we print an open letter trust to his arguments for material for their<br />\nfrom the chief rooter. All who are interested own efforts.

The Junior the<br />\nwhile has had his \"baptism of fire.\" The<br />\nglory of the pot social is dimmed by distance,<br />\nor the memory of a sore head. He has lost<br />\nhis itching for the fray. With depleted ranks,<br />\nhe is routed. And so, as a consequence, the<br />\nbenevolent intention of hazing is lost, unless<br />\nthe humbling of the Junior is as much a service as the salting of the fresh.<br />\nMost of us, certainly the Seniors, are more<br />\nconcerned with the budding hopes of the New<br />\nYear than with the ashes of the Old. But 1898<br />\nhas had many things to make it memorable in<br />\nHopkins annals. Was not the completion of<br />\nthe new gymnasium and the long dreamed of<br />\ncage enough? But to this was added a gorgeous series of athletic triumphs\u2014the winning<br />\nof the lacrosse championship, the relay at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, first and brilliant<br />\nhonors in the Maryland Intercollegiate Association and the Maryland Athletic Union, together with that smart entrance into the American Intercollegiate games at Berkely Oval.<br />\nBut 1898 was not content with athletic victories: the Musical Association, and the College<br />\nCongress, with its public prize debate, came as<br />\nbrand-new features of our University life.

WIGHT'S RADIOGRAPHS.<br />\n<br />\nA highly interesting exhibit of radiographs<br />\nis hung in McCoy Hall, the work of Mr. Carol<br />\nWight, 19oo, associated with his brother, Dr.<br />\nT. Sherman Wight. A novel method was employed. The radiographs exhibited are direct<br />\nprints on ordinary bromide paper. Advantage<br />\nis taken of the flexibility of the paper to secure<br />\nclose contact with the part to be radiographed,<br />\ninsuring sharper delineation. In one example, an inflexible necrosed elbow-joint, bent at<br />\nright angles, was photographed by bending the<br />\nsensitive paper round the \"back\" of the joint,<br />\nand the resulting picture shows the projection<br />\nof two perpendicular planes.<br />\nThe most important feature of the method<br />\nused by Mr. Wight over the ordinary method,<br />\nis that more \"opaque\" parts are light in the resulting print, those more permeable, dark. So<br />\ndetail is not lost in shadows. In a radiograph<br />\nof the hand, the sesimoid bones, the nails, epipyses and the overlapping of flesh between the<br />\nfingers is shown clearly and sharply. In certain cases diseased tissue has been successfully<br />\ndetected. The collection includes radiographs<br />\nof the shoulder, knee joint, fractures of the fore<br />\narm and several of rabbits.<br />\n<br />\n\f40.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATH LETICS.<br />\n<br />\nTHE JUNIOR-FRESHMEN FOOTBALL GAME.<br />\n<br />\nThe regular football season at the University<br />\ncame to an end with our game at St. John's<br />\nCollege, on November 16th. The Junior and<br />\n'Freshman classes decided, however, to extend<br />\nthe season a little, and to put their rivalry to a<br />\npractical test in a struggle at Electric Park.<br />\nThe game took place on Wednesday, December 7th. Both teams were confident, the<br />\nJuniors in their weight, and the Freshmen in<br />\ntheir team work. On each side were some of<br />\nthe best players in the undergraduate department. The Juniors, however, were over-confident, and did not play with as much vim as<br />\nthey would otherwise have shown. The<br />\nFreshmen played their best, and, though outweighed, held their opponents; and the game<br />\nresulted in a draw.<br />\nBull's long run placed I90I's goal in extreme danger at one time, but the score was<br />\nprevented by Constantine, who followed him<br />\nclear down the field, and threw him on the tenyard line. Glaser made a good run just before<br />\nthe game ended. These runs, with Griffin's<br />\nbeautiful tackle of Wirt in the first half, were<br />\nthe best plays. The backs on both sides also<br />\ndistinguished themselves.<br />\nGriffin kicked off, and, after the ball was put<br />\ninto play, the Juniors made a few gains, and<br />\nthen fumbled. The ball went over, and Griffin<br />\npunted to I9oo's fifteen-yard line. After some<br />\ngains of five and three yards by Sayler and<br />\nGriffin, the Juniors got the ball, and Wirt and<br />\nBull went around the ends and through the<br />\nline for ten yards and three yards, respectively.<br />\nThen came Bull's long run and his tackle by<br />\nConstantine and Sayler on the ten-yard line.<br />\nThe Juniors, however, were unable to carry<br />\nthe ball over the goal line.<br />\nThe second half was merely a repetition of<br />\nthe first. The Juniors were crippled, and their<br />\nteam work was poor; while the playing of the<br />\nFreshmen improved. The game ended with<br />\nthe score o to o.<br />\n<br />\nThe game was interesting not only as an opportunity to measure the strength of the two<br />\nclasses, which seem to be quite evenly matched,<br />\nbut also as an indication of the prospect for the<br />\nnext year's 'Varsity team. Bruton, W. L.<br />\nSmith, Whitman, Sayler, and Griffin, all of<br />\nwhom were \"subs\" this season, are the most<br />\npromising candidates.<br />\nThe line-up of the teams was:<br />\nJuniors.<br />\n<br />\nPositions.<br />\n<br />\nFreshmen.<br />\n<br />\nW.

RUSH.<br />\n<br />\nEver since the opening of the University<br />\nthis year, the Freshman and the Junior classes<br />\nhave been spoiling for a chance to measure<br />\nstrength with each other.<br />\nThey were prevented from hazing and having \"pot-socials\" by a faculty decree issued<br />\nlast year, which prohibited such sport.<br />\nAt last a way was discovered. It was suggested to have a football game between teams<br />\nfrom the two classes. The game was held, but<br />\nunfortunately (for some) neither side scored,<br />\nand the question still remained unanswered,<br />\n\"Which is the stronger class?\"<br />\nThis question was given much thought all<br />\nthe way from the football grounds back to the<br />\nGymnasium, and likewise much discussion ensued. By the time each team and their classmates reached the \"Gym.\" it was just about<br />\nready to prove the other class inferior; but<br />\nthere could be no \"pot-socialing,\" so what was<br />\nto be done? Soon it was suggested that there<br />\nbe a cane rush. Everyone consented, so without much delay the representatives of the two<br />\nclasses were out in the Cage, Freshmen at one<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nend and Juniors at the other. The Freshmen<br />\nhad a slight advantage over the Juniors, in<br />\nhaving more men present. It was too late,<br />\nhowever, to have an equal representation from<br />\neach class, so they contested unequally.<br />\nThe cane was thrown up in the middle of the<br />\nCage, and then the fun began. They tugged<br />\nand pushed and pulled and wrestled, until the<br />\nsignal was given to stop.<br />\nThe hands on the stick were then counted,<br />\nand the result was: Freshmen, 13 hands; Juniors, 10 hands.<br />\nThis was quite a blow to the Juniors, who<br />\ndeclared that they would have won in an equal<br />\ncontest, while the Freshmen went away in<br />\ngreat glee.<br />\nLACROSSE.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nMUSCULAR UNDERGRADUATES.<br />\n<br />\nComparisons are odious, but comparisons<br />\nbetween junior and freshmen classes must be<br />\nwade, if not in one way in another. Football<br />\nand cane rush have failed to show any marked<br />\nadvantage in favor of either this year. Accordingly we have obtained from Dr. Crenshaw the<br />\nfigures representing the total strength tests of<br />\nthe ten strongest men in each class. By this<br />\ncomparison, the integrity of which is beyond<br />\ncavil, it will be seen that i9oo has a very slight<br />\nadvantage, and that the assertion that the<br />\nclasses are evenly matched is well founded.<br />\nThe figures are as follows:<br />\n1901<br />\nDuck<br />\nSayler<br />\nFishach<br />\nPowers<br />\nMiller, H.

They<br />\nhave exceptional opportunities for studying<br />\nthe conditions by which they are surrounded,<br />\nand acquire an influence over their neighbors<br />\nwhich it would be impossible to gain in any<br />\nother way.<br />\nWork of this kind was begun in Baltimore<br />\nin 1893, when Rev. Edward A. Lawrence, pastor of the First Congregational Church, and<br />\nMr. E. D. Thomson, of the University, went<br />\nto live in Baltimore's tenement section on Parkin street. Mr. Lawrence died soon after, and<br />\nan association, of which the Hopkins Y. M. C.<br />\nA. is a member, determined to carry on the<br />\nwork in his name. This organization is known<br />\nas the Lawrence Memorial Association, and<br />\nthe house which it now owns is called \"Lawrence House.\" Students of the Woman's College and the young people of the First Congregational and Harlem Avenue Christian<br />\nChurches are also represented in its management.<br />\nIn this house work for the improvement of<br />\nthe boys and girls of the neighborhood is carried on. It is not a religious institution, and<br />\nno religious services are held. Educational<br />\nclasses, manual training and amusements are<br />\nprovided for the boys. There are work<br />\nbenches where they learn to use carpenters'<br />\n,tools, and skilled wood-workers teach them<br />\ncarving., The instruction is all practical, and<br />\ninteresting games and amusements are used<br />\njudiciously. On certain days the house is<br />\nopen for girls. Lessons in cooking strike at<br />\nthe root of false economy in the household,<br />\none of the greatest causes of poverty. In the<br />\nsewing classes girls learn to cut and finish<br />\ntheir own garments, and some are taught to<br />\nembroider. All these efforts, directed at the<br />\nmost impressionable class in the community,<br />\nare wonderfully successful. More boys and<br />\ngirls apply for admission than can be accommodated.<br />\nThe house is not only a means of carrying<br />\non the classes just mentioned, but serves also<br />\nas a model household. The children arc<br />\ntaught how to sweep and dust, make beds, and<br /><br />\nmanage the details of housekeeping. The<br />\nwhole building is designed as an object lesson.<br />\nOf late the work has been reaching out in<br />\nboth directions. There is a kindergarten for<br />\nthe little ones, and a savings bank that has<br />\nbeen of much service to the boys will be extended for the use of their elders. Other efforts in behalf of the adults of the neighborhood are contemplated.<br />\nAt present no students lodge in the house.<br />\nIt is being found, generally, in the settlement<br />\nwork, that most students can work more effectively by visiting the houses at regular<br />\nhours, leaving others to give their whole time<br />\nto the field.<br />\nAmong the Hopkins students now engaged<br />\nat Lawrence House are Messrs. H. B. Foster,<br />\nJ. S. Chamberlain, N. A. Kent and H. A.<br />\nHamilton, of the graduate departments, and<br />\nMessrs. Rous, Schermerhorn and J. G. Griffin,<br />\nfrom the undergraduates.<br />\nTHE FIRST MUSICALE.<br />\nThe series of entertainments to be given this<br />\nyear by the Hopkins Musical Association was<br />\nbegun by a delightful concert in McCoy Hall,<br />\non December 10. President Gilman welcomed<br />\nthe guests of the association in a few graceful<br />\nwords at the beginning of the programme.<br />\nThe music was in charge of Mr. Edward<br />\nHeimendahl, who played as the first number<br />\na violin arioso by Julius Reitz, in which he<br />\nwas accompanied on the organ by Mr. G.<br />\nWright Nicols. He played with careful attention to phrasing, being hampered somewhat by an unresponsive accompaniment.<br />\nThis, however, only ac.cented his control over<br />\nthe instrument and his perfect familiarity with<br />\n,the composer. Two trios for sopranos were<br />\nwell sung by the Misses Brown, Carey and<br />\nPagon. The three voices harmonized beautifully, and showed much attention to precision<br />\nin time and expression. The choice of the<br />\nChopin fantasy for piano, played by Miss Hermine Lenders, was possibly injudicious, as it<br />\nlacks sustained interest. The performance<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nwas conscientious, and Miss Leuders' technique unquestioned. Dr. Baker sang four<br />\n.,songs by McDowell, artistic little pieces which<br />\nwere , well interpreted, though the singer<br />\nseemed not to be in his best form. The last<br />\nselection, a piano quintet by Schumann, was<br />\nquite successful, considering the importance of<br />\nthe work and the limited time available for rehearsals. The performers were Miss Leuders,<br />\nMessrs. Heimendahl, Moses, Siemann, and<br />\nFuerthermaier.<br /><br />\nA WORD FROM THE CHIEF ROOTER.<br /><br />\nTo the Editors Of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nA CLASS ON CURRENT TOPICS.<br /><br />\nDr. J. H. Hollander, of the Department of<br />\nHistorical and Political Science, recently revived an interesting course of study on topics<br />\nof current interest in American politics. He<br />\ntakes the Congressional Record and other reports of public proceedings in Washington,<br />\nand discourses on the more important matters<br />\nhorn week to week, with a class of advanced<br />\nstudents. Last year a deep interest was awakened among the students by a similar course,<br />\nand the present conference should be even<br />\nmore successful, in view of the great interest<br />\nnow existing in American colonial and international questions. No better illustration<br />\ncould be desired of the true significance of<br />\nFreeman's motto, \"History is past politics, and<br />\npolitics present history.\" Hopkins students<br />\nshould be abreast of the age in which they are<br />\nto live and work.<br /><br />\nThe way the Hopkins men rooted at the St.<br />\nJohn's football game, and, in fact, at all our<br />\ngames last fall, was a disgrace. In the first<br />\nplace, they paid no attention to grouping themselves properly.

U.; or box 398, Medical School<br />\nofJohns Hopkins Hospital.<br /><br />\nConditions at Hopkins differ from those<br />\nfound in mostcolleges in that the collegiate and<br />\npost-graduate departments are of about the<br />\nsame size. For this reason outsiders who know<br />\nonly the one or the other frequently get their<br />\nideas of our college life somewhat mixed. Visitors who are familiar with the advanced department alone, often embarrass under-graduates by asking what college they are from,and<br />\nBaltimoreans who get their ideas of us from<br />\nthe daily press wrongfully attribute to the<br />\ngraduates the innocent diversions of their juniors. If the incipient Ph. D.'s will unbend a<br />\nlittle, and the under-graduates take on some<br />\nadded dignity, we shall reach the golden mean<br />\nthat will make our student-body homogeneous.<br /><br />\nenemy. Don't ramble about the field, but stay<br />\nwhere you're put and attend to business. We<br />\nhope that Dr. Crenshaw will give the rooters a<br />\nplace in the indoor exhibition. The suggestion of practice in the cage is a good one, and<br />\nshould be taken up. Give the chief rooter a<br />\nshow.<br />\nAfter the Christmas vacation, the season of<br />\nclass banquets will soon be upon us. The<br />\nbanqueters will do well to remember that the<br />\nobject of these gatherings is good-fellowship.<br />\nThe food and drink are incidental features that<br />\ncontribute to that end. A banquet should<br />\nbring the men closer together and cement the<br />\nfriendships that have been forming in classroom and gym. For this purpose the toasts<br />\nand responses are more important than they<br />\nare sometimes considered. A certain degree<br />\nof dignity and decorum are essential, even at a<br />\nfreshman banquet. A risque story that seems<br />\nunobjectionable in a group of two or three,<br />\nmay be in very bad taste when delivered to a<br />\nlarger company. Over-abundant enthusiasm<br />\nthat disregards the rights of others soon becomes a nuisance.<br /><br />\nThe Senate of the Johns Hopkins University seems determined to imitate its archetype<br />\nin more ways than one. It has developed a<br />\ngreat facility in wasting time over unimportant<br />\npoints, and often shows a decided lack of interest when debate is in order. We fear that the<br />\nSenators do not take themselves seriously<br />\nenough. They rely on inadequate preparation for speeches, because the time for debate<br />\nis short. Those who follow the first speaker<br />\nIn another column we print an open letter trust to his arguments for material for their<br />\nfrom the chief rooter. All who are interested own efforts.

The preparatory years of<br />\nthe Freshman were inspirited with the lore of<br />\ngreen. paint, pot socials and kindred festivities.<br />\nHe comes into the arena<br />\ne., the cage) with<br />\nhis sleeves rolled up and \"light in his eye.\" He<br />\ncomes in great numbers. The Junior the<br />\nwhile has had his \"baptism of fire.\" The<br />\nglory of the pot social is dimmed by distance,<br />\nor the memory of a sore head. He has lost<br />\nhis itching for the fray. With depleted ranks,<br />\nhe is routed. And so, as a consequence, the<br />\nbenevolent intention of hazing is lost, unless<br />\nthe humbling of the Junior is as much a service as the salting of the fresh.<br />\nMost of us, certainly the Seniors, are more<br />\nconcerned with the budding hopes of the New<br />\nYear than with the ashes of the Old. But 1898<br />\nhas had many things to make it memorable in<br />\nHopkins annals. Was not the completion of<br />\nthe new gymnasium and the long dreamed of<br />\ncage enough? But to this was added a gorgeous series of athletic triumphs\u2014the winning<br />\nof the lacrosse championship, the relay at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, first and brilliant<br />\nhonors in the Maryland Intercollegiate Association and the Maryland Athletic Union, together with that smart entrance into the American Intercollegiate games at Berkely Oval.<br />\nBut 1898 was not content with athletic victories: the Musical Association, and the College<br />\nCongress, with its public prize debate, came as<br />\nbrand-new features of our University life. The<br />\nappropriation from the State, the inauguration<br />\nof the Teachers' Lectures\u2014how significant!<br />\nAnd not least of all was witnessed the passing<br />\nof hazing!

WIGHT'S RADIOGRAPHS.<br /><br />\nA highly interesting exhibit of radiographs<br />\nis hung in McCoy Hall, the work of Mr. Carol<br />\nWight, 19oo, associated with his brother, Dr.<br />\nT. Sherman Wight. A novel method was employed. The radiographs exhibited are direct<br />\nprints on ordinary bromide paper. Advantage<br />\nis taken of the flexibility of the paper to secure<br />\nclose contact with the part to be radiographed,<br />\ninsuring sharper delineation. In one example, an inflexible necrosed elbow-joint, bent at<br />\nright angles, was photographed by bending the<br />\nsensitive paper round the \"back\" of the joint,<br />\nand the resulting picture shows the projection<br />\nof two perpendicular planes.<br />\nThe most important feature of the method<br />\nused by Mr. Wight over the ordinary method,<br />\nis that more \"opaque\" parts are light in the resulting print, those more permeable, dark. So<br />\ndetail is not lost in shadows. In a radiograph<br />\nof the hand, the sesimoid bones, the nails, epipyses and the overlapping of flesh between the<br />\nfingers is shown clearly and sharply. In certain cases diseased tissue has been successfully<br />\ndetected. The collection includes radiographs<br />\nof the shoulder, knee joint, fractures of the fore<br />\narm and several of rabbits.<br /><br />\n40.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nATH LETICS.<br /><br />\nTHE JUNIOR-FRESHMEN FOOTBALL GAME.<br /><br />\nThe regular football season at the University<br />\ncame to an end with our game at St. John's<br />\nCollege, on November 16th. The Junior and<br />\n'Freshman classes decided, however, to extend<br />\nthe season a little, and to put their rivalry to a<br />\npractical test in a struggle at Electric Park.<br />\nThe game took place on Wednesday, December 7th. Both teams were confident, the<br />\nJuniors in their weight, and the Freshmen in<br />\ntheir team work. On each side were some of<br />\nthe best players in the undergraduate department. The Juniors, however, were over-confident, and did not play with as much vim as<br />\nthey would otherwise have shown. The<br />\nFreshmen played their best, and, though outweighed, held their opponents; and the game<br />\nresulted in a draw.<br />\nBull's long run placed I90I's goal in extreme danger at one time, but the score was<br />\nprevented by Constantine, who followed him<br />\nclear down the field, and threw him on the tenyard line. Glaser made a good run just before<br />\nthe game ended. These runs, with Griffin's<br />\nbeautiful tackle of Wirt in the first half, were<br />\nthe best plays. The backs on both sides also<br />\ndistinguished themselves.<br />\nGriffin kicked off, and, after the ball was put<br />\ninto play, the Juniors made a few gains, and<br />\nthen fumbled. The ball went over, and Griffin<br />\npunted to I9oo's fifteen-yard line. After some<br />\ngains of five and three yards by Sayler and<br />\nGriffin, the Juniors got the ball, and Wirt and<br />\nBull went around the ends and through the<br />\nline for ten yards and three yards, respectively.<br />\nThen came Bull's long run and his tackle by<br />\nConstantine and Sayler on the ten-yard line.<br />\nThe Juniors, however, were unable to carry<br />\nthe ball over the goal line.<br />\nThe second half was merely a repetition of<br />\nthe first. The Juniors were crippled, and their<br />\nteam work was poor; while the playing of the<br />\nFreshmen improved. The game ended with<br />\nthe score o to o.<br /><br />\nThe game was interesting not only as an opportunity to measure the strength of the two<br />\nclasses, which seem to be quite evenly matched,<br />\nbut also as an indication of the prospect for the<br />\nnext year's 'Varsity team. Bruton, W. L.<br />\nSmith, Whitman, Sayler, and Griffin, all of<br />\nwhom were \"subs\" this season, are the most<br />\npromising candidates.<br />\nThe line-up of the teams was:<br />\nJuniors.<br /><br />\nPositions.<br /><br />\nFreshmen.<br /><br />\nW.

RUSH.<br /><br />\nEver since the opening of the University<br />\nthis year, the Freshman and the Junior classes<br />\nhave been spoiling for a chance to measure<br />\nstrength with each other.<br />\nThey were prevented from hazing and having \"pot-socials\" by a faculty decree issued<br />\nlast year, which prohibited such sport.<br />\nAt last a way was discovered. It was suggested to have a football game between teams<br />\nfrom the two classes. The game was held, but<br />\nunfortunately (for some) neither side scored,<br />\nand the question still remained unanswered,<br />\n\"Which is the stronger class?\"<br />\nThis question was given much thought all<br />\nthe way from the football grounds back to the<br />\nGymnasium, and likewise much discussion ensued. By the time each team and their classmates reached the \"Gym.\" it was just about<br />\nready to prove the other class inferior; but<br />\nthere could be no \"pot-socialing,\" so what was<br />\nto be done? Soon it was suggested that there<br />\nbe a cane rush. Everyone consented, so without much delay the representatives of the two<br />\nclasses were out in the Cage, Freshmen at one<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nend and Juniors at the other. The Freshmen<br />\nhad a slight advantage over the Juniors, in<br />\nhaving more men present. It was too late,<br />\nhowever, to have an equal representation from<br />\neach class, so they contested unequally.<br />\nThe cane was thrown up in the middle of the<br />\nCage, and then the fun began. They tugged<br />\nand pushed and pulled and wrestled, until the<br />\nsignal was given to stop.<br />\nThe hands on the stick were then counted,<br />\nand the result was: Freshmen, 13 hands; Juniors, 10 hands.<br />\nThis was quite a blow to the Juniors, who<br />\ndeclared that they would have won in an equal<br />\ncontest, while the Freshmen went away in<br />\ngreat glee.<br />\nLACROSSE.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nMUSCULAR UNDERGRADUATES.<br /><br />\nComparisons are odious, but comparisons<br />\nbetween junior and freshmen classes must be<br />\nwade, if not in one way in another. Football<br />\nand cane rush have failed to show any marked<br />\nadvantage in favor of either this year. Accordingly we have obtained from Dr. Crenshaw the<br />\nfigures representing the total strength tests of<br />\nthe ten strongest men in each class. By this<br />\ncomparison, the integrity of which is beyond<br />\ncavil, it will be seen that i9oo has a very slight<br />\nadvantage, and that the assertion that the<br />\nclasses are evenly matched is well founded.<br />\nThe figures are as follows:<br />\n1901<br />\nDuck<br />\nSayler<br />\nFishach<br />\nPowers<br />\nMiller, H.
