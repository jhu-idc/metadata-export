Gifts and endowment income reduced the Hospital's operating loss to a net loss<br />\nof $30,000, the lowest in eight<br />\nyears.<br />\nBut, the treasurer's report emphasizes, the use of endowment<br />\n<br />\nincome and gifts to offset operating loss deprives the Hospital of<br />\na source of funds for needed improvements in existing facilities.<br />\nAlmost half of the Hospital's<br />\nrise in operating expenses was<br />\naccounted for by an increase in<br />\nsalaries and wages paid to 2,805<br />\nemployees. The Hospital's payroll<br />\nrose to $8,551,569, and increase<br />\nof 7 per cent ( $564,000) over the<br />\nprevious year. Most of this increase came from higher wage<br />\nscales adopted by Johns Hopkins<br />\non January 1, 1961.<br />\nMuch of the operating loss resulted from $761,000 worth of<br />\nfree medical care provided to<br />\npatients who could not qualify<br />\nfor aid under the state's indigent<br />\nprogram and who had little or no<br />\nhospitalization insurance.<br />\n<br />\nStudies<br />\nGroup<br />\nMU<br />\nOPEN<br />\nWIDE<br />\nand<br />\nSAY<br />\nA-H-H-H.<br />\nGet that refreshing new feeling with Coke!<br />\n<br />\nCauses Of Epilepsy<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\nCoca-Cola Bottling Company, Baltimore, Md.<br />\n<br />\nIottled under authority of The Coca-Cola Company<br />\n<br />\nCheck your opinions against VM's Campus Opinion Poll 16<br />\n<br />\n0 How would you spend a $5000 inheritance?<br />\n<br />\n0 more education 0 European tour<br />\n<br />\n0Should the faculty<br />\nhave the power to<br />\ncensor campus<br />\nnewspapers?<br />\n<br />\n0 sports car<br />\n<br />\n0 stocks<br />\n<br />\nO What's your favorite<br />\ntime for smoking?<br />\n<br />\nO while studying<br />\nO during a date<br />\n0 anytime there's stress & strain<br />\n<br />\nExpEct more, get more, from LIA<br />\n'Oa 037.01 SATAN VIL39911<br />\n<br />\nHERE'S HOW 1029<br />\nSTUDENTS AT 100<br />\nCOLLEGES VOTED!<br />\n<br />\nSt:13111A<br />\n<br />\n%ss\u2014u!oris (s) ssaiis<br />\naiep A.N<br />\n1)4ms U7<br />\n%La<br />\n%gz suoissas flq<br />\n%88<br />\n<br />\nON el<br />\nSaA<br />\n<br />\ndli<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n3105'1111%<br />\n<br />\n3/1.1.<br />\n<br />\n4.<br />\n<br />\n--Destruction by localized heat<br />\nof one of the chief neural \"way<br />\nstations\" through which fit-causing electrical impulses pass in the<br />\nbrain.<br />\n--Statistical studies of the<br />\nrelation of childhood head I- njuries to adult epilepsy.<br />\nMembers of the Walker greup<br />\nare Dr. John S.

However, despite these well meaning attempts, the primary<br />\ndeficiencies of Hopkins fraternity rushing still remain<br />\noutstanding. Depending upon one's point of view, the<br />\nfirst semester rush is either too long and drawn out<br />\nor too short to make the proper choice, either too concentrated or not enough so, etc. But perhaps most crucial<br />\nof all, it really does not give freshmen adequate opportunity to see the various fraternities as they actually<br />\nlive and operate. Most freshmen select rather haphazardly or prefer to enter open rushing.<br />\nThere are several courses of action open to the<br />\nIFC at this point. The most obvious is experimentation<br />\nwith second semester rushing, but there are other systems<br />\nwhich deserve consideration. A survey of other universities having similar fraternity set-ups might be in order.<br />\nIf the second semester system is introduced, careful<br />\nprecautions must be taken to prevent the first semester<br />\nfrom becoming one long secret, or not so secret, rush<br />\nseason. This happens on many campuses and can become a burden on both actives and freshmen. The IFC<br />\nmust determine whether the advantages of such a system<br />\noutweigh its disadvantages, something which might have<br />\nto be done by actual experimentation.<br />\n<br />\n. photo by Ireland.,<br />\n.<br />\n\"If I'd known this was an all boy school.\".<br />\n<br />\nCampus Urbanization<br />\nnot without considerable pleasure and<br />\n01'pride,Wethenote,<br />\nblossoming of construction activities around<br />\nthis rapidly expanding campus.

I'll<br />\nbet you are, you scamps! But I am not one to be harsh with<br />\nthose who forget we are in a new year, for I myself have long<br />\nbeen guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my senior year at<br />\ncollege, I wrote 1873 on my papers until nearly November of<br />\n1874! (It turned out, incidentally, not to be such a serious<br />\nerror because, as we all know, 1874 was later repealed by<br />\nPresident Chester A. Arthur in a fit of pique over the Black<br />\nTom Explosion. And, as we all know, Mr. Arthur later came<br />\nto regret his hasty action. Who does not recall that famous<br />\nmeeting between Mr. Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr.<br />\nArthur said, \"Lou, I wish I hadn't of repealed 1874.\" Whereupon the French emperor made his immortal rejoinder, \"Tipi<br />\nTie nous et tyler tu.\" Well sir, they had many a good laugh<br />\nabout that, as you can imagine.)<br />\nBut I digress. How can we remember to write 1962 on our<br />\npapers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find something<br />\nmemorable about 1962, something unique to fix it firmly in<br />\nyour mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know,<br />\n1962 is the first year in history that is divisible by 2, by 4, and<br />\nby 7. Take a pencil and try it: 1962 divided by 2 is 981; 1962<br />\ndivided by 4 is 490-1/2; 1962 divided by 7 is 280-2/7.This mathematical curiosity will not occur again until the year 2079, but<br />\nwe will all be so busy then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur<br />\n<br />\nhi-centenary that we will scarcely have time to be writing<br />\npapers and letters and like that.<br />\nAnother clever little trick to fix the year 1962 in your mind<br />\nis to remember that 1962 spelled backwards is 2691. \"Year\"<br />\nspelled backwards is \"raey.\" \"Marlboro\" spelled backwards is<br />\n\"oroblram.\" Marlboro smoked backwards is no fun at all.<br />\nKindly do not light the filter. What you do is put the filter end<br />\nin your lips, then light the tobacco end, then draw, and then<br />\nfind out what pleasure, what joy, what rapture serene it is to<br />\nsmoke the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. In 1962, as<br />\nin once and future years, you'll get a lot to like in a Marlboro\u2014<br />\navailable in soft pack and flip-top box in all 50 states and<br />\nDuluth.<br />\nBut I digress. We were speaking of the memorable aspects<br />\nof 1962 and high among them, of course, is the fact that in<br />\n1962 the entire House of Representatives stands for election.<br />\nThere will, no doubt, be many lively and interesting contests,<br />\nbut none, I'll wager, quite so lively and interesting as the one<br />\nin my own district where the leading candidate is none other<br />\nthan Chester A. Arthur!<br />\nMr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to come<br />\nout of retirement and run for the House of Representatives.<br />\nJohn Quincy Adams was the first. Mr. Adams also holds<br />\nanother distinction: he was the first son of a president ever to<br />\nserve as president. It is true that Martin Van Buren's son,<br />\nWalter \"I31inky\" Van Buren, was at one time offered. the nomination for the presidency, but he, alas, had already accepted<br />\na bid to become Mad Ludwig of Bavaria. James K. Polk's son,<br />\non the other hand, became Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fillmore's son went into air conditioning.

Gifts and endowment income reduced the Hospital's operating loss to a net loss<br />\nof $30,000, the lowest in eight<br />\nyears.<br />\nBut, the treasurer's report emphasizes, the use of endowment<br /><br />\nincome and gifts to offset operating loss deprives the Hospital of<br />\na source of funds for needed improvements in existing facilities.<br />\nAlmost half of the Hospital's<br />\nrise in operating expenses was<br />\naccounted for by an increase in<br />\nsalaries and wages paid to 2,805<br />\nemployees. The Hospital's payroll<br />\nrose to $8,551,569, and increase<br />\nof 7 per cent ( $564,000) over the<br />\nprevious year. Most of this increase came from higher wage<br />\nscales adopted by Johns Hopkins<br />\non January 1, 1961.<br />\nMuch of the operating loss resulted from $761,000 worth of<br />\nfree medical care provided to<br />\npatients who could not qualify<br />\nfor aid under the state's indigent<br />\nprogram and who had little or no<br />\nhospitalization insurance.<br /><br />\nStudies<br />\nGroup<br />\nMU<br />\nOPEN<br />\nWIDE<br />\nand<br />\nSAY<br />\nA-H-H-H.<br />\nGet that refreshing new feeling with Coke!<br /><br />\nCauses Of Epilepsy<br /><br />\nby<br />\nCoca-Cola Bottling Company, Baltimore, Md.<br /><br />\nIottled under authority of The Coca-Cola Company<br /><br />\nCheck your opinions against VM's Campus Opinion Poll 16<br /><br />\n0 How would you spend a $5000 inheritance?<br /><br />\n0 more education 0 European tour<br /><br />\n0Should the faculty<br />\nhave the power to<br />\ncensor campus<br />\nnewspapers?<br /><br />\n0 sports car<br /><br />\n0 stocks<br /><br />\nO What's your favorite<br />\ntime for smoking?<br /><br />\nO while studying<br />\nO during a date<br />\n0 anytime there's stress &amp; strain<br /><br />\nExpEct more, get more, from LIA<br />\n'Oa 037.01 SATAN VIL39911<br /><br />\nHERE'S HOW 1029<br />\nSTUDENTS AT 100<br />\nCOLLEGES VOTED!<br /><br />\nSt:13111A<br /><br />\n%ss\u2014u!oris (s) ssaiis<br />\naiep A.N<br />\n1)4ms U7<br />\n%La<br />\n%gz suoissas flq<br />\n%88<br /><br />\nON el<br />\nSaA<br /><br />\ndli<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\n3105'1111%<br /><br />\n3/1.1.<br /><br />\n4.<br /><br />\n--Destruction by localized heat<br />\nof one of the chief neural \"way<br />\nstations\" through which fit-causing electrical impulses pass in the<br />\nbrain.<br />\n--Statistical studies of the<br />\nrelation of childhood head I- njuries to adult epilepsy.<br />\nMembers of the Walker greup<br />\nare Dr. John S.

However, despite these well meaning attempts, the primary<br />\ndeficiencies of Hopkins fraternity rushing still remain<br />\noutstanding. Depending upon one's point of view, the<br />\nfirst semester rush is either too long and drawn out<br />\nor too short to make the proper choice, either too concentrated or not enough so, etc. But perhaps most crucial<br />\nof all, it really does not give freshmen adequate opportunity to see the various fraternities as they actually<br />\nlive and operate. Most freshmen select rather haphazardly or prefer to enter open rushing.<br />\nThere are several courses of action open to the<br />\nIFC at this point. The most obvious is experimentation<br />\nwith second semester rushing, but there are other systems<br />\nwhich deserve consideration. A survey of other universities having similar fraternity set-ups might be in order.<br />\nIf the second semester system is introduced, careful<br />\nprecautions must be taken to prevent the first semester<br />\nfrom becoming one long secret, or not so secret, rush<br />\nseason. This happens on many campuses and can become a burden on both actives and freshmen. The IFC<br />\nmust determine whether the advantages of such a system<br />\noutweigh its disadvantages, something which might have<br />\nto be done by actual experimentation.<br /><br />\n. photo by Ireland.,<br />\n.<br />\n\"If I'd known this was an all boy school.\".<br /><br />\nCampus Urbanization<br />\nnot without considerable pleasure and<br />\n01'pride,Wethenote,<br />\nblossoming of construction activities around<br />\nthis rapidly expanding campus.

I'll<br />\nbet you are, you scamps! But I am not one to be harsh with<br />\nthose who forget we are in a new year, for I myself have long<br />\nbeen guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my senior year at<br />\ncollege, I wrote 1873 on my papers until nearly November of<br />\n1874! (It turned out, incidentally, not to be such a serious<br />\nerror because, as we all know, 1874 was later repealed by<br />\nPresident Chester A. Arthur in a fit of pique over the Black<br />\nTom Explosion. And, as we all know, Mr. Arthur later came<br />\nto regret his hasty action. Who does not recall that famous<br />\nmeeting between Mr. Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr.<br />\nArthur said, \"Lou, I wish I hadn't of repealed 1874.\" Whereupon the French emperor made his immortal rejoinder, \"Tipi<br />\nTie nous et tyler tu.\" Well sir, they had many a good laugh<br />\nabout that, as you can imagine.)<br />\nBut I digress. How can we remember to write 1962 on our<br />\npapers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find something<br />\nmemorable about 1962, something unique to fix it firmly in<br />\nyour mind. Happily, this is very simple because, as we all know,<br />\n1962 is the first year in history that is divisible by 2, by 4, and<br />\nby 7. Take a pencil and try it: 1962 divided by 2 is 981; 1962<br />\ndivided by 4 is 490-1/2; 1962 divided by 7 is 280-2/7.This mathematical curiosity will not occur again until the year 2079, but<br />\nwe will all be so busy then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur<br /><br />\nhi-centenary that we will scarcely have time to be writing<br />\npapers and letters and like that.<br />\nAnother clever little trick to fix the year 1962 in your mind<br />\nis to remember that 1962 spelled backwards is 2691. \"Year\"<br />\nspelled backwards is \"raey.\" \"Marlboro\" spelled backwards is<br />\n\"oroblram.\" Marlboro smoked backwards is no fun at all.<br />\nKindly do not light the filter. What you do is put the filter end<br />\nin your lips, then light the tobacco end, then draw, and then<br />\nfind out what pleasure, what joy, what rapture serene it is to<br />\nsmoke the filter cigarette with the unfiltered taste. In 1962, as<br />\nin once and future years, you'll get a lot to like in a Marlboro\u2014<br />\navailable in soft pack and flip-top box in all 50 states and<br />\nDuluth.<br />\nBut I digress. We were speaking of the memorable aspects<br />\nof 1962 and high among them, of course, is the fact that in<br />\n1962 the entire House of Representatives stands for election.<br />\nThere will, no doubt, be many lively and interesting contests,<br />\nbut none, I'll wager, quite so lively and interesting as the one<br />\nin my own district where the leading candidate is none other<br />\nthan Chester A. Arthur!<br />\nMr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to come<br />\nout of retirement and run for the House of Representatives.<br />\nJohn Quincy Adams was the first. Mr. Adams also holds<br />\nanother distinction: he was the first son of a president ever to<br />\nserve as president. It is true that Martin Van Buren's son,<br />\nWalter \"I31inky\" Van Buren, was at one time offered. the nomination for the presidency, but he, alas, had already accepted<br />\na bid to become Mad Ludwig of Bavaria.
