An efficient Dean<br />\nmust listen (seriously) to the<br />\nwail of an engineer who complains<br />\nthat eight is too low a mark for the<br />\nbest man in his class, to the sorrowful tales of trustees, to the longuishing suggestions of very unimportant instructors, and to the suave<br />\nadvice of so-called campus leaders.<br />\nBesides all this, he must try to maintam n a .900 batting average in<br />\nguessing at fitting applicants for<br />\nmedical school.<br />\nMaybe now, we have decided that<br />\nafter all, perhaps our Dean actually<br />\nhas had a chance to see every side<br />\nof our present college system.

Now imagine that we're<br />\nstudying language. We've perused<br />\nour texts, and we're certain that we<br />\nknow our stuff \"cold.\" We enter the<br />\nclassroom, and some gray-haired old<br />\nmaid from Eastern or Western<br />\nwastes half an hour explaining<br />\nsomething or other, merely to be<br />\nable to keep the class together for<br />\nan hour or two; even though whatever she explains is exceedingly absurd, trivial, and absolutely unimportant. Her explanation done,<br />\ntranslation is started, and we think<br />\nof everything but our text, while<br />\nsome ignoramus wobbles through<br />\nthree sentences of himple data. The<br />\nnext person to be called upon is a<br />\ngirl, who smiles innocently at the<br />\nconcerned instructor, (in order to<br />\nremind her that she has invited this<br />\naged linguist to tea on Sunday).<br />\nOur pure maiden then whispers an<br />\nunintelligible sentence in a monotone and receives as a compliment:<br />\n.\" This<br />\n\"Very good, Miss<br />\ntype of student always receives a<br />\ncomplimentary 9.5 or 10 at mid-year<br />\nand June. Then our impartial instructor calls on some unfortunate<br />\nmale, for sight translation, and<br />\ncalmly dissects his translations, substituting synonyms for each of his<br />\nnouns, and negative antonyms for<br />\neach of his verbs. And so two more<br />\nhours of perfect monotony are<br />\nwasted away.
