The<br />\nexclusion of the Student Council<br />\nPresident from a permanent role<br />\nwill allow for the election of<br />\nthree members from the body of<br />\nthe SAC.<br />\nThe proposal was accepted as a<br />\nmodification to the SAC by-laws<br />\nand guidelines which, as a whole,<br />\nhave not yet been ratified.

That the SAC Executive Committee is, in<br />\npractice, the SAC, is evidenced in its by-law that states:<br />\n\"...the Executive Committee shall act for the SAC when the<br />\nSAC cannot tonvene.\" The SAC meets once a year.<br />\nHowever, by specifically legislating the SC President off<br />\nthe permanent membership of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee, members of the SAC have indicated that they no<br />\nlonger want a Council President who will guide the SAC and<br />\nits functions\u2014the MSE Symposium, the Spring Fair,<br />\nOrientation, etc.\u2014and supervise directly the apportionment<br />\nof the money his Council officially requested and will be held<br />\naccountable for. Stripped of control over these major<br />\nfunctions, the President and the Council would have little<br />\ninfluence over student life here.<br />\nBy retaining the SC President on an expanded SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee, the SAC would achieve the delicate<br />\nbalance between executive strength and democratic<br />\nparticipation.<br />\n<br />\nBy JOHN R.

To have a<br />\nperson designated to type his<br />\ncorrespondence, open his mail,<br />\nscreen visitors, make his<br />\nappointments and his coffee, and<br />\nhelp him push paper was tangible<br />\nevidence of an administrator's<br />\nstatus. But what was prized in<br />\ndays gone by is today passe.<br />\nThere are now new symbols of<br />\nstatus for Hopkins<br />\nAdministrators. To be sure, a<br />\npersonal xerox. copier is one, but<br />\nalmost or impressive is an<br />\nadministrative assistant.<br />\nNow just exactly what an A.A.<br />\ndoes or is supposed to do is hard<br />\nto say. There is a very fine line of<br />\ndistinction between the position<br />\n<br />\nof secretary and administrative<br />\nassistant.<br />\nAn A.A. is responsible for the<br />\nsupervision of clerical personnel<br />\nin a given office. However, their<br />\nsupervisory duties are somehow<br />\nintrinsically limited when there is<br />\nonly one secretary in the office.<br />\nIn the Financial Aid office for<br />\nexample, there is one secretary<br />\nand one Administrative Assistant.<br />\nSimilarly, Jeanine Sommers, A.A.<br />\nto Dean of Academic Programs<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind, must<br />\noversee the clerical work of<br />\nanother secretary. Not really<br />\nmonumental administrative tasks,<br />\none might say.<br />\nHowever, the responsibilites of<br />\nadministrative assistants don't<br />\nstop there.<br />\n\"I'm a little bit of everything<br />\nand nothing,\" said Sommers of<br />\nher position. \"The official buffer<br />\nbetween a student and the Dean.<br />\nI try to please both and don't<br />\n<br />\nLarry Denton<br />\n<br />\nsucceed with either.\"<br />\nIn terms of real functions,<br />\nSommers couldn't articulate how<br />\nher role changed when she was<br />\npromoted from executive<br />\nsecretary to A.A. She related the<br />\nchange as \"instead of taking care<br />\nof all the little boys (the<br />\nstudents) I take care of just one<br />\nbig one (Suskind).\" She said that<br />\nshe is involved in less detailed<br />\nwork as an A.A. than as a<br />\nsecretary.<br />\n\"Call me nothing,\" she<br />\nquipped. \"No, call me aspirin.\"<br />\nA.A.'s proliferate the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. Nearly every office with<br />\nmore than one secretary has one.<br />\nThe departmental offices usually<br />\nhave one. The title of<br />\nadministrative assistant, in'<br />\nreality, is seemingly awarded to<br />\nthose secretaries who show a fair<br />\ndegree of competency and who<br />\nare in line for a promotion. There<br />\nis only so far a person can go as a<br />\nsecretary on the University pay<br />\nscales. Sommers, for example<br />\nworked here eight years, before<br />\nbeing promoted to A.A.<br />\nNow, above and beyond the<br />\nposition of A.A., is that of<br />\nExecutive Assistant. The<br />\ndistinction between A.A. and<br />\nE.A. is even more blurred than<br />\nthat of E.A. and secretary. Like<br />\nsecretaries and A.A.'s, E.A.'s are<br />\nthe people that students and<br />\nbusiness people most often have<br />\ncontact with. But, E.A.'s seem to<br />\nhave substantially more authority<br />\nthan your basic A.A. As<br />\ndescribed by the people who<br />\n<br />\nhold the positions on campus,<br />\nBenton. Denton would say<br />\nthe E.A.'s main function is to<br />\nsomething, the community<br />\nscreen mail, phone calls, and<br />\nwould be outraged, so that<br />\npeople for their bosses. In the - Benton could then know what he<br />\nwords of E.A. kingpin Jakie Hall, could get by with in the<br />\nPresident Muller's E.A., \"I tell community and soothe the<br />\npeople who come to see Muller if ruffled feathers of all those<br />\nhe's really the person they need offended by his .E.A. Denton<br />\nto see.\" E.A.'s shoo away all but may not have come-off looking<br />\nthe very most urgent concerns all that good, but Benton<br />\nfrom their superiors.<br />\ncame-off as the great campus<br />\nIn discussing E.A.'s, there is concilliator.<br />\nreally on ly one place to start \u2014<br />\nDenton isn't only valuable in<br />\nLarry Denton. As \"Executive examining the E.A. because he<br />\nAssistant to Dr. Benton, Vice was the one who popularized the<br />\nPresident of Homewood position \u2014 for to be sure, E.A.'s<br />\nDivision , Denton, by merely I are a fast growing important<br />\nholding that title, put the minority on campus \u2014 but also<br />\nposition into the Hopkins because he has moved up and<br />\nvenacular.

She has<br />\nresponsibility for the hiring and<br />\nfiring of two secretaries and for<br />\nkeeping an eye on the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget. But as for<br />\nexecutive authority, in her own<br />\nwords again, \"He's the Dean, I'm<br />\nnot.\"<br />\nWhen Denton left Benton's<br />\n<br />\nE.A.'s? There is one common<br />\nthread tying the E.A. bigwigs \u2014<br />\nKeesler, Murdock, and Bibs \u2014<br />\ntogether. One common fact to<br />\ntheir backgrounds that explains<br />\ntheir raison d'etre as well as the<br />\nentire Administrative heirarchical<br />\nladder. And that is, before<br />\nbecoming an E.A., each worked<br />\nat the University as an A.A.!<br />\nThus, the truth lies bare. The<br />\nposition of A.A. is merely a<br />\nstepping stone to the position of<br />\nE.A. Only a select few of the<br />\nA.A.'s can make it up to the high<br />\nand mighty position of E.A. Only<br />\nthe best can obtain the position<br />\nof E.A., for it is the E.A.'s who<br />\nhelp run the University. They are<br />\nthe people students and faculty<br />\nmust have direct contact with. It<br />\nis they who make the day to day<br />\ndecisions. And it is they who<br />\nhave the formidable task of<br />\nkeeping their 'bosses' heads on<br />\ntheir respective shoulders.<br />\nIt wouldn't be surprising if a<br />\nfew more E.A.'s popped up on<br />\ncampus in the next few years.<br />\nThey are proliferating at a<br />\nformidable rate. And if they take<br />\nDenton's lead, they may all wind<br />\nup in very high places. And then<br />\nthere will be a need for more and<br />\nmore E.A.'s. And soon, who<br />\nknows? A.A.'s may become<br />\npasse. The E.A. may well be the<br />\nadministrative status symbol of<br />\nthe future.<br />\n<br />\nBenton<br />\noffice for bigger and better<br />\nthings, the void left seemed<br />\nunfillable; nevertheless it was, in<br />\nthe person of long time<br />\nUniversity Employee Betty.<br />\nMurdock. Her job is, she admits,<br />\n\"to send people in the right<br />\nplaces,\" in addition to reviewing<br />\nmail and seeing people-- \"to take<br />\nalot of the load off him<br />\n(Benton).\"<br />\nThe latest addition to the E.A.<br />\nset is Barbara Roth, who was<br />\nelevated to the exalted position<br />\nof E.A. to the Dean of Students<br />\nBob Fitzpatrick, just a few<br />\nmonths ago.

The<br />\nafternoon's rilvalry had been<br />\namong equals and had proerly<br />\nconcluded in a 0-0 tie. The Blue<br />\nJays are now 0-1 in the<br />\nconference and 0-2-1 overall.<br />\nAs in the case in any given<br />\ncontest, Tuesday's game was<br />\nmarked by frequent transmitions<br />\nof momentum, the one squad<br />\nnow on a momentary march, the<br />\nother in a quick paced retreat.<br />\nThe ball moved back and forth<br />\nacross the length of the field<br />\nseeming to follow a pattern of its<br />\nown divination - the action of the<br />\nmoment centering on the play of<br />\n<br />\nthe moment; the play of the<br />\nmoment now in the grasp of the ;<br />\none team and then in the hands<br />\nof the other. At no time<br />\nhowever, did either team assume<br />\na commanding position. The Blue<br />\nJays were never seriously<br />\nthreatened nor for their own part<br />\nwere they ever seriously<br />\nthreatening.<br />\nWhile luck (or the lact of it,<br />\ndepending upon your particular<br />\npole of partisanship) has played<br />\nan influential role in Hopkins'<br />\nprevious two outings, it had only<br />\nminimal significance in this<br />\nweek's contest. There were a few<br />\ninstances in which the Blue Jays<br />\nmight have benefited had the<br />\nfates been with them \u2014 as when a<br />\nsecond half strike by Hopkins<br />\nlineman Tom Myrick hit the goal<br />\nsupport and faded away from the<br />\ngoal instead of into it \u2014 but<br />\n<br />\nHopkins X-country<br />\nearn split in tri-meet<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAF<br />\nShowing solid . improvement,<br />\nthe Hopkins' cross-country team<br />\nearned a split in Wednesday's<br />\nhome tri-meet against Gettysburg<br />\nand Salisbury State. Salisbury fell<br />\neasily 21-34, but Gettysburg was<br />\noverwhelming beating the<br />\nHopkins' five 16-47.<br />\nThe awesome Gettysburg<br />\nsquad took 7 of the first 9 places<br />\nin the race, and their first three<br />\nmen became co-holders of the<br />\ncource record at 30:35.11.<br />\nThe strength of the Hopkin's<br />\nteam effort is easily seen on the<br />\ntime sheet. The top seven had<br />\ntheir best times over the 5.5 mile<br />\ncource.<br />\nJim Kennedy agina paced the<br />\nharriers, taking 5th in the meed<br />\nand outclassing the first runner<br />\nfrom Salisbury. Jeff Greve was<br />\n9th overall, and also defeated the<br />\nfirst Salisbury runner.<br />\nThe rest of the Hopkins' top<br />\nfive easily defeated their<br />\nSalisbury counter-parts. John<br />\nTetzlaff, Bob Alworth and Jon<br />\n<br />\nHigdon all had improved times<br />\nwhile helping to earn the split<br />\ndecision. The large improvement<br />\nin the clocking of Freshman<br />\nAlworth is espeically<br />\nencouraging.<br />\nThough not scoring, 6 to 8th<br />\nplaces on the Hopkin's squad, in<br />\nJohn Sakowicz, Randy Safier and<br />\nDan Berlowitz, all moved closer<br />\nto the leader's time compared to<br />\nthe last outing. On a given day,<br />\nany of these men can be<br />\nexpected to join the top five.<br />\nCoach Masken feels that this<br />\nteam has more depth than any<br />\ncross-country squad in recent<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe Blue Jay harriers will take<br />\ntheir 2 - 1 record to run UMBC<br />\nnext Saturday, at the cource<br />\nwhere the Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference Championship will be<br />\nheld later in November. The team<br />\nhad good times on this cource<br />\nlast year, and expects to do well<br />\nagainst the UMBC squad, and<br />\ngain valuable experience on their<br />\ncource.<br />\n<br />\nfortune remained primarily<br />\nwithin the confines of a shadowy<br />\nhideaway, contenting himself<br />\nwith speculative rather than<br />\nconcrete activity.<br />\nWhat was improtant in<br />\nTuesday's contest were lemental<br />\nfactors. Throughout the game<br />\nthere was a substantial uprising in<br />\nthe wind which blew with<br />\nferocious constancy from the<br />\noutset. In soccer this is primarily<br />\na negative factor. It partitions the<br />\ngame more clearly into separate<br />\nhalfs in that a given team is less<br />\n<br />\nhampered in shooting when the<br />\nwind is with them and when the<br />\nwind is constant it is with them<br />\nfor one half only. Thus Delaware<br />\ntook thirty shots, two-thirds of<br />\nthem in the first half, while<br />\nHopkins booted ten, all of them<br />\nin the second.<br />\nCoach Robert Oliver was<br />\nbasically pleased with the team's<br />\noverall performance. Up and<br />\ndown the line he could not single<br />\nout any one individual worthy of<br />\nmore mention that the squad<br />\ndeserved as a whole.<br />\n<br />\nNEws-turrat<br />\n<br />\nAnd he had reason to be<br />\npleased, for their is pleasure even<br />\nwithout victory. As the season<br />\nopened, Delaware had begun to<br />\nbuild for itself a substnatial<br />\nreputation. In two previous<br />\ncontests they were undefeated<br />\nand unscored on, having rocked<br />\nperenial powerhouses Franklin<br />\nand Marshall and Elizabethtown<br />\nby scores of 7 - 0 and I - 0<br />\nrespectively. The Blue Jays are<br />\nthus the first team to have<br />\nstymied on otherwise potent<br />\nDelaware offense.<br />\n<br />\nsports<br />\n<br />\nJays home opener under lights<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nThe Blue Jay football squad<br />\nwill take to the lights this<br />\nSaturday as they face the<br />\nDiplomats of Franklin and<br />\nMarshall. The Jays will play their<br />\nhome opener under the lights this<br />\nSaturday night.<br />\nComing off a hard fought 9-0<br />\nblanking of Mulenberg last<br />\nweekend, the starting eleven will<br />\nhave its hands full with the<br />\nDiplomats. Franklin and Marshall<br />\nwon three consecutive MAC<br />\nchampionships in the Southern<br />\ndivision and are favored to win it<br />\nagain this year.<br />\nThe F&M offense is led by<br />\nsophomore quarterback Joe<br />\nCoviello who was the ECAC<br />\nrookie-of-the-year in 1973. The<br />\n5' 11\", 190 pound Coviello<br />\nproves to be one of the strongest<br />\nlinks in the Diplomat offense.<br />\nBut the strength of F&M lies<br />\n<br />\nnot in its offense, but in its<br />\ndefense. F&M has one of the<br />\nstrongest defensive units in the<br />\nleague. Last Saturday, F&M<br />\ndestroyed the Bears of Ursinus<br />\nby an overwhelming score of 45<br />\nto 6. Six of their seven<br />\ntouchdowns against Ursinus were<br />\nset up by their defense as they<br />\nintercepted 2 passes, recovered 5<br />\nof the Bears 7 fumbles and<br />\nblocked one punt.<br />\n\"Their linebackers are some of<br />\nthe best in the league,\"<br />\ncommented Coach Cox. \"'Their<br />\ndefense is excellent.\" Led by<br />\ntricaptain Roger Smith, the<br />\nlinebacking jobs are held by four<br />\nreturning varsity lettermen.<br />\nJunior Rich MacNeal vies with<br />\nsenior John Onzik for the outside<br />\nLB slot. Sharing the inside<br />\nlinebacking responsibilities with<br />\nSmith is 6', 185 pounds, David<br />\nParry, a junior. The other OLB is<br />\njunior Jack Nanhorne.<br />\n<br />\n\"The key to the game is going<br />\nto be how well our offense<br />\ndoes,\" continued Coach Cox. He<br />\neven feels his squad can win<br />\nagainst the tough F&M defense.<br />\none ranked nationally for<br />\ndefensing against the rush and for<br />\nits scoring defense.<br />\n,Interesting<br />\nAn interesting sidenote to the<br />\nfirst of three home games for the<br />\nJays is that this will be the first<br />\nF;nce 1940 that a night football<br />\ncontest was held involving the<br />\nJays. Both Coach Cox and<br />\nAthletic Director Robert Scott,<br />\nare hopeful for a good crowd<br />\nfeeling that the scheduling of a<br />\nnight game may spark a further<br />\ninterest in Blue Jay football.<br />\nWhen asked his feelings about<br />\nplaying a game under the lights,<br />\nCoach Cox stated<br />\nenthusiastically, \"I love it.\"<br />\nGame time is 8:30 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nWhere To Buy It<br />\n; FOOD SERVICES<br />\n<br />\n6ORUICA<br />\n<br />\nA Favorite Rendez-Wu<br />\nfor Hopkins Men<br />\n<br />\nJIMMY WU'S.<br />\nNEW CHINA INN!<br />\nCharles Street Below 25th<br />\n<br />\nNatural Food Store<br />\n2322 N.CbariesSt.<br />\n_ 10% OFF..<br />\nwith this coupon .<br />\n<br />\n\"<br />\n<br />\n5511 York Road<br />\n<br />\nOpen for Lunch<br />\n11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. '<br />\nDinner 5:30 p.m. - 11 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nBOOKS<br />\nALLEN'S BOOKSHOP<br />\nBaltimore's Newest<br />\nUsed Book Store<br />\n344 E. 33rd Stref<br />\n<br />\nPizzas, Late - night snacks<br />\n<br />\nPECORA'S<br />\n3320 Greenmount Avenue<br />\n<br />\n243-4356<br />\nUsed & Rare, Old & Out-of-print<br />\n<br />\nJohn P.

The<br />\nexclusion of the Student Council<br />\nPresident from a permanent role<br />\nwill allow for the election of<br />\nthree members from the body of<br />\nthe SAC.<br />\nThe proposal was accepted as a<br />\nmodification to the SAC by-laws<br />\nand guidelines which, as a whole,<br />\nhave not yet been ratified. The<br />\nadopted proposal included the<br /><br />\nstipulation that the three<br />\nmembers to be elected to the<br />\nExecutive Committee could<br />\nconceivably include the Student<br />\nCouncil President. Also included<br />\nwas a measure prohibiting any<br />\norganization from holding two of<br />\nthe three elected posts.<br />\nFurthermore, Savitz<br />\ncontended that the change, even<br />\nif it is eventually, ratified along<br />\nwith the other SAC by-laws, will<br />\nnot become effective this year.<br />\n\"I'll never be excluded from an<br />\nSAC Executive Committee<br />\nmeeting,\" he asserted. \"Any<br />\nchanges won't take place until<br />\nnext year.\"<br />\nFeltheimer leveled charges that<br />\nthe presence of Savitz on the<br />\nExecutive Committee made the<br />\npanel unrepresentative of the<br />\nwide interests of the SAC<br />\nmembership and created a<br />\n\"conflict of interest.\" Feltheimer<br />\nand others argued that the<br />\nExecutive Committee meets<br /><br />\nfrequently by the provision of<br />\nthe SAC by-law stipulating that<br />\nthe Committee shall \"act for the<br />\nSAC, when the SAC cannot<br />\nconvene,\" and at these times<br />\nmakes decisions concerning<br />\nallottments from the SAC's<br />\n\"Contingency Fund\" and<br />\nroom-use policy. Feltheimer<br />\npointed out that the Student<br />\nCouncil and other member clubs<br />\nare often competing for the same<br />\nfunds and space, creating a<br />\nconflict.<br />\nSavitz contested these charges,<br />\narguing that the SC President is<br />\none of the few officials elected<br />\nby all the students and is<br />\ntherefore less partisan than most<br />\nSAC members.<br />\n\"Of all the elected presidents<br />\nand officials of all of the Hopkins<br />\norganizations, the Student<br />\nCouncil President and Treasurer<br />\nare two of only four who are<br />\nprivileged enough to be elected<br />\nby the entire student body,\"<br /><br />\nThE hopkiNs<br />\nQUOTE OF THE WEEK<br />\n\"This shows the real meat of<br />\nwhat people will be discussing,\"<br />\nsaid MSE co-chairman Michael<br />\nDe Priest in reference to the<br />\nErotic Cinema Circus.<br /><br />\nSavitz said.<br />\n\"By removing the Student<br />\nCouncil President, the SAC will<br />\nbe cutting off its nose to spite its<br />\nface,\" he continued. \"The<br />\nStudent Council President has a<br />\ngreat deal of leverage in<br />\nbargaining with the<br />\nadministration of this University,<br />\nsomething the Executive<br />\nCommittee members must do, to<br />\nacquire funds for the SAC<br />\nbudget,\" he added.<br />\nSavitz also advanced the<br />\nargument that the three members<br />\nof the SAC elected to the<br />\nExecutive Committee would be<br />\nrequired to invest fofour to six<br />\nhours of their time weekly and<br />\nthey should therefore relinquish<br />\nthe offices they hold within their<br />\norganizations. Feltheimer<br />\nrebutted this position by calling<br />\nfor the resignation of Savitz as<br />\nStudent Council President on<br />\nsimilar grounds.<br />\nIn other SAC business, it was<br /><br />\nAndy Savitz<br />\nannounced that Student<br />\nActivities cubicles will be<br />\nsupplemented by rooms on the<br />\nfir<br />\nfloor of the Aeronautics<br />\nBuilding.

Dr.<br />\nPeter Achtinstein, Chairman of<br />\nthe Philosophy Department,<br /><br />\nasked if the administration was<br />\nconsidering a quarter system.

Though we feel that<br />\nthe decision to expand the membership of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee from three to five was a wise one, we think it is<br />\nfacile and pointless to legislatively forbid the Student Council<br />\nPresident from being a permanent member of the Executive<br />\nCommittee. That the SAC Executive Committee is, in<br />\npractice, the SAC, is evidenced in its by-law that states:<br />\n\"...the Executive Committee shall act for the SAC when the<br />\nSAC cannot tonvene.\" The SAC meets once a year.<br />\nHowever, by specifically legislating the SC President off<br />\nthe permanent membership of the SAC Executive<br />\nCommittee, members of the SAC have indicated that they no<br />\nlonger want a Council President who will guide the SAC and<br />\nits functions\u2014the MSE Symposium, the Spring Fair,<br />\nOrientation, etc.\u2014and supervise directly the apportionment<br />\nof the money his Council officially requested and will be held<br />\naccountable for. Stripped of control over these major<br />\nfunctions, the President and the Council would have little<br />\ninfluence over student life here.<br />\nBy retaining the SC President on an expanded SAC<br />\nExecutive Committee, the SAC would achieve the delicate<br />\nbalance between executive strength and democratic<br />\nparticipation.<br /><br />\nBy JOHN R.

To have a<br />\nperson designated to type his<br />\ncorrespondence, open his mail,<br />\nscreen visitors, make his<br />\nappointments and his coffee, and<br />\nhelp him push paper was tangible<br />\nevidence of an administrator's<br />\nstatus. But what was prized in<br />\ndays gone by is today passe.<br />\nThere are now new symbols of<br />\nstatus for Hopkins<br />\nAdministrators. To be sure, a<br />\npersonal xerox. copier is one, but<br />\nalmost or impressive is an<br />\nadministrative assistant.<br />\nNow just exactly what an A.A.<br />\ndoes or is supposed to do is hard<br />\nto say. There is a very fine line of<br />\ndistinction between the position<br /><br />\nof secretary and administrative<br />\nassistant.<br />\nAn A.A. is responsible for the<br />\nsupervision of clerical personnel<br />\nin a given office. However, their<br />\nsupervisory duties are somehow<br />\nintrinsically limited when there is<br />\nonly one secretary in the office.<br />\nIn the Financial Aid office for<br />\nexample, there is one secretary<br />\nand one Administrative Assistant.<br />\nSimilarly, Jeanine Sommers, A.A.<br />\nto Dean of Academic Programs<br />\nDr. Sigmund Suskind, must<br />\noversee the clerical work of<br />\nanother secretary. Not really<br />\nmonumental administrative tasks,<br />\none might say.<br />\nHowever, the responsibilites of<br />\nadministrative assistants don't<br />\nstop there.<br />\n\"I'm a little bit of everything<br />\nand nothing,\" said Sommers of<br />\nher position. \"The official buffer<br />\nbetween a student and the Dean.<br />\nI try to please both and don't<br /><br />\nLarry Denton<br /><br />\nsucceed with either.\"<br />\nIn terms of real functions,<br />\nSommers couldn't articulate how<br />\nher role changed when she was<br />\npromoted from executive<br />\nsecretary to A.A. She related the<br />\nchange as \"instead of taking care<br />\nof all the little boys (the<br />\nstudents) I take care of just one<br />\nbig one (Suskind).\" She said that<br />\nshe is involved in less detailed<br />\nwork as an A.A. than as a<br />\nsecretary.<br />\n\"Call me nothing,\" she<br />\nquipped. \"No, call me aspirin.\"<br />\nA.A.'s proliferate the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. Nearly every office with<br />\nmore than one secretary has one.<br />\nThe departmental offices usually<br />\nhave one. The title of<br />\nadministrative assistant, in'<br />\nreality, is seemingly awarded to<br />\nthose secretaries who show a fair<br />\ndegree of competency and who<br />\nare in line for a promotion. There<br />\nis only so far a person can go as a<br />\nsecretary on the University pay<br />\nscales. Sommers, for example<br />\nworked here eight years, before<br />\nbeing promoted to A.A.<br />\nNow, above and beyond the<br />\nposition of A.A., is that of<br />\nExecutive Assistant. The<br />\ndistinction between A.A. and<br />\nE.A. is even more blurred than<br />\nthat of E.A. and secretary. Like<br />\nsecretaries and A.A.'s, E.A.'s are<br />\nthe people that students and<br />\nbusiness people most often have<br />\ncontact with. But, E.A.'s seem to<br />\nhave substantially more authority<br />\nthan your basic A.A. As<br />\ndescribed by the people who<br /><br />\nhold the positions on campus,<br />\nBenton. Denton would say<br />\nthe E.A.'s main function is to<br />\nsomething, the community<br />\nscreen mail, phone calls, and<br />\nwould be outraged, so that<br />\npeople for their bosses. In the - Benton could then know what he<br />\nwords of E.A. kingpin Jakie Hall, could get by with in the<br />\nPresident Muller's E.A., \"I tell community and soothe the<br />\npeople who come to see Muller if ruffled feathers of all those<br />\nhe's really the person they need offended by his .E.A. Denton<br />\nto see.\" E.A.'s shoo away all but may not have come-off looking<br />\nthe very most urgent concerns all that good, but Benton<br />\nfrom their superiors.<br />\ncame-off as the great campus<br />\nIn discussing E.A.'s, there is concilliator.<br />\nreally on ly one place to start \u2014<br />\nDenton isn't only valuable in<br />\nLarry Denton.

But<br />\nnow the Deans have them as well.<br />\nIrene Keesler, E.A. to Dean of<br />\nArts and Sciences Dr. George<br />\nOwen, became an E.A. in July of<br />\n1972. Though not as prominent<br />\nPublicly as Denton, she, in here<br />\nown words \"runs the Dean's<br />\noffice\u2014the mechanism.\" Like<br />\nHall, she screens and filters<br />\ncontact with her boss. She has<br />\nresponsibility for the hiring and<br />\nfiring of two secretaries and for<br />\nkeeping an eye on the Arts and<br />\nSciences budget. But as for<br />\nexecutive authority, in her own<br />\nwords again, \"He's the Dean, I'm<br />\nnot.\"<br />\nWhen Denton left Benton's<br /><br />\nE.A.'s? There is one common<br />\nthread tying the E.A. bigwigs \u2014<br />\nKeesler, Murdock, and Bibs \u2014<br />\ntogether. One common fact to<br />\ntheir backgrounds that explains<br />\ntheir raison d'etre as well as the<br />\nentire Administrative heirarchical<br />\nladder. And that is, before<br />\nbecoming an E.A., each worked<br />\nat the University as an A.A.!<br />\nThus, the truth lies bare. The<br />\nposition of A.A. is merely a<br />\nstepping stone to the position of<br />\nE.A. Only a select few of the<br />\nA.A.'s can make it up to the high<br />\nand mighty position of E.A. Only<br />\nthe best can obtain the position<br />\nof E.A., for it is the E.A.'s who<br />\nhelp run the University. They are<br />\nthe people students and faculty<br />\nmust have direct contact with. It<br />\nis they who make the day to day<br />\ndecisions. And it is they who<br />\nhave the formidable task of<br />\nkeeping their 'bosses' heads on<br />\ntheir respective shoulders.<br />\nIt wouldn't be surprising if a<br />\nfew more E.A.'s popped up on<br />\ncampus in the next few years.<br />\nThey are proliferating at a<br />\nformidable rate. And if they take<br />\nDenton's lead, they may all wind<br />\nup in very high places. And then<br />\nthere will be a need for more and<br />\nmore E.A.'s. And soon, who<br />\nknows? A.A.'s may become<br />\npasse. The E.A. may well be the<br />\nadministrative status symbol of<br />\nthe future.<br /><br />\nBenton<br />\noffice for bigger and better<br />\nthings, the void left seemed<br />\nunfillable; nevertheless it was, in<br />\nthe person of long time<br />\nUniversity Employee Betty.<br />\nMurdock. Her job is, she admits,<br />\n\"to send people in the right<br />\nplaces,\" in addition to reviewing<br />\nmail and seeing people-- \"to take<br />\nalot of the load off him<br />\n(Benton).\"<br />\nThe latest addition to the E.A.<br />\nset is Barbara Roth, who was<br />\nelevated to the exalted position<br />\nof E.A. to the Dean of Students<br />\nBob Fitzpatrick, just a few<br />\nmonths ago. She is \"the alter ego<br />\nto Bob.\" \"Bibs,\" as Roth is<br />\ninformally known, is responsible<br />\nfor the operation of the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office.

The Blue<br />\nJays are now 0-1 in the<br />\nconference and 0-2-1 overall.<br />\nAs in the case in any given<br />\ncontest, Tuesday's game was<br />\nmarked by frequent transmitions<br />\nof momentum, the one squad<br />\nnow on a momentary march, the<br />\nother in a quick paced retreat.<br />\nThe ball moved back and forth<br />\nacross the length of the field<br />\nseeming to follow a pattern of its<br />\nown divination - the action of the<br />\nmoment centering on the play of<br /><br />\nthe moment; the play of the<br />\nmoment now in the grasp of the ;<br />\none team and then in the hands<br />\nof the other. At no time<br />\nhowever, did either team assume<br />\na commanding position. The Blue<br />\nJays were never seriously<br />\nthreatened nor for their own part<br />\nwere they ever seriously<br />\nthreatening.<br />\nWhile luck (or the lact of it,<br />\ndepending upon your particular<br />\npole of partisanship) has played<br />\nan influential role in Hopkins'<br />\nprevious two outings, it had only<br />\nminimal significance in this<br />\nweek's contest. There were a few<br />\ninstances in which the Blue Jays<br />\nmight have benefited had the<br />\nfates been with them \u2014 as when a<br />\nsecond half strike by Hopkins<br />\nlineman Tom Myrick hit the goal<br />\nsupport and faded away from the<br />\ngoal instead of into it \u2014 but<br /><br />\nHopkins X-country<br />\nearn split in tri-meet<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAF<br />\nShowing solid . improvement,<br />\nthe Hopkins' cross-country team<br />\nearned a split in Wednesday's<br />\nhome tri-meet against Gettysburg<br />\nand Salisbury State. Salisbury fell<br />\neasily 21-34, but Gettysburg was<br />\noverwhelming beating the<br />\nHopkins' five 16-47.<br />\nThe awesome Gettysburg<br />\nsquad took 7 of the first 9 places<br />\nin the race, and their first three<br />\nmen became co-holders of the<br />\ncource record at 30:35.11.<br />\nThe strength of the Hopkin's<br />\nteam effort is easily seen on the<br />\ntime sheet. The top seven had<br />\ntheir best times over the 5.5 mile<br />\ncource.<br />\nJim Kennedy agina paced the<br />\nharriers, taking 5th in the meed<br />\nand outclassing the first runner<br />\nfrom Salisbury. Jeff Greve was<br />\n9th overall, and also defeated the<br />\nfirst Salisbury runner.<br />\nThe rest of the Hopkins' top<br />\nfive easily defeated their<br />\nSalisbury counter-parts. John<br />\nTetzlaff, Bob Alworth and Jon<br /><br />\nHigdon all had improved times<br />\nwhile helping to earn the split<br />\ndecision. The large improvement<br />\nin the clocking of Freshman<br />\nAlworth is espeically<br />\nencouraging.<br />\nThough not scoring, 6 to 8th<br />\nplaces on the Hopkin's squad, in<br />\nJohn Sakowicz, Randy Safier and<br />\nDan Berlowitz, all moved closer<br />\nto the leader's time compared to<br />\nthe last outing. On a given day,<br />\nany of these men can be<br />\nexpected to join the top five.<br />\nCoach Masken feels that this<br />\nteam has more depth than any<br />\ncross-country squad in recent<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe Blue Jay harriers will take<br />\ntheir 2 - 1 record to run UMBC<br />\nnext Saturday, at the cource<br />\nwhere the Mason-Dixon<br />\nConference Championship will be<br />\nheld later in November. The team<br />\nhad good times on this cource<br />\nlast year, and expects to do well<br />\nagainst the UMBC squad, and<br />\ngain valuable experience on their<br />\ncource.<br /><br />\nfortune remained primarily<br />\nwithin the confines of a shadowy<br />\nhideaway, contenting himself<br />\nwith speculative rather than<br />\nconcrete activity.<br />\nWhat was improtant in<br />\nTuesday's contest were lemental<br />\nfactors. Throughout the game<br />\nthere was a substantial uprising in<br />\nthe wind which blew with<br />\nferocious constancy from the<br />\noutset. In soccer this is primarily<br />\na negative factor. It partitions the<br />\ngame more clearly into separate<br />\nhalfs in that a given team is less<br /><br />\nhampered in shooting when the<br />\nwind is with them and when the<br />\nwind is constant it is with them<br />\nfor one half only. Thus Delaware<br />\ntook thirty shots, two-thirds of<br />\nthem in the first half, while<br />\nHopkins booted ten, all of them<br />\nin the second.<br />\nCoach Robert Oliver was<br />\nbasically pleased with the team's<br />\noverall performance. Up and<br />\ndown the line he could not single<br />\nout any one individual worthy of<br />\nmore mention that the squad<br />\ndeserved as a whole.<br /><br />\nNEws-turrat<br /><br />\nAnd he had reason to be<br />\npleased, for their is pleasure even<br />\nwithout victory. As the season<br />\nopened, Delaware had begun to<br />\nbuild for itself a substnatial<br />\nreputation. In two previous<br />\ncontests they were undefeated<br />\nand unscored on, having rocked<br />\nperenial powerhouses Franklin<br />\nand Marshall and Elizabethtown<br />\nby scores of 7 - 0 and I - 0<br />\nrespectively. The Blue Jays are<br />\nthus the first team to have<br />\nstymied on otherwise potent<br />\nDelaware offense.<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nJays home opener under lights<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nThe Blue Jay football squad<br />\nwill take to the lights this<br />\nSaturday as they face the<br />\nDiplomats of Franklin and<br />\nMarshall. The Jays will play their<br />\nhome opener under the lights this<br />\nSaturday night.<br />\nComing off a hard fought 9-0<br />\nblanking of Mulenberg last<br />\nweekend, the starting eleven will<br />\nhave its hands full with the<br />\nDiplomats. Franklin and Marshall<br />\nwon three consecutive MAC<br />\nchampionships in the Southern<br />\ndivision and are favored to win it<br />\nagain this year.<br />\nThe F&amp;M offense is led by<br />\nsophomore quarterback Joe<br />\nCoviello who was the ECAC<br />\nrookie-of-the-year in 1973. The<br />\n5' 11\", 190 pound Coviello<br />\nproves to be one of the strongest<br />\nlinks in the Diplomat offense.<br />\nBut the strength of F&amp;M lies<br /><br />\nnot in its offense, but in its<br />\ndefense. F&amp;M has one of the<br />\nstrongest defensive units in the<br />\nleague. Last Saturday, F&amp;M<br />\ndestroyed the Bears of Ursinus<br />\nby an overwhelming score of 45<br />\nto 6. Six of their seven<br />\ntouchdowns against Ursinus were<br />\nset up by their defense as they<br />\nintercepted 2 passes, recovered 5<br />\nof the Bears 7 fumbles and<br />\nblocked one punt.<br />\n\"Their linebackers are some of<br />\nthe best in the league,\"<br />\ncommented Coach Cox. \"'Their<br />\ndefense is excellent.\" Led by<br />\ntricaptain Roger Smith, the<br />\nlinebacking jobs are held by four<br />\nreturning varsity lettermen.<br />\nJunior Rich MacNeal vies with<br />\nsenior John Onzik for the outside<br />\nLB slot. Sharing the inside<br />\nlinebacking responsibilities with<br />\nSmith is 6', 185 pounds, David<br />\nParry, a junior. The other OLB is<br />\njunior Jack Nanhorne.<br /><br />\n\"The key to the game is going<br />\nto be how well our offense<br />\ndoes,\" continued Coach Cox. He<br />\neven feels his squad can win<br />\nagainst the tough F&amp;M defense.<br />\none ranked nationally for<br />\ndefensing against the rush and for<br />\nits scoring defense.<br />\n,Interesting<br />\nAn interesting sidenote to the<br />\nfirst of three home games for the<br />\nJays is that this will be the first<br />\nF;nce 1940 that a night football<br />\ncontest was held involving the<br />\nJays. Both Coach Cox and<br />\nAthletic Director Robert Scott,<br />\nare hopeful for a good crowd<br />\nfeeling that the scheduling of a<br />\nnight game may spark a further<br />\ninterest in Blue Jay football.<br />\nWhen asked his feelings about<br />\nplaying a game under the lights,<br />\nCoach Cox stated<br />\nenthusiastically, \"I love it.\"<br />\nGame time is 8:30 p.m.<br /><br />\nWhere To Buy It<br />\n; FOOD SERVICES<br /><br />\n6ORUICA<br /><br />\nA Favorite Rendez-Wu<br />\nfor Hopkins Men<br /><br />\nJIMMY WU'S.<br />\nNEW CHINA INN!<br />\nCharles Street Below 25th<br /><br />\nNatural Food Store<br />\n2322 N.CbariesSt.<br />\n_ 10% OFF..<br />\nwith this coupon .<br /><br />\n\"<br /><br />\n5511 York Road<br /><br />\nOpen for Lunch<br />\n11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. '<br />\nDinner 5:30 p.m. - 11 p.m.<br /><br />\nBOOKS<br />\nALLEN'S BOOKSHOP<br />\nBaltimore's Newest<br />\nUsed Book Store<br />\n344 E. 33rd Stref<br /><br />\nPizzas, Late - night snacks<br /><br />\nPECORA'S<br />\n3320 Greenmount Avenue<br /><br />\n243-4356<br />\nUsed &amp; Rare, Old &amp; Out-of-print<br /><br />\nJohn P.
