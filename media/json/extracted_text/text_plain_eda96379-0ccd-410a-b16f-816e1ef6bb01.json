Ames, well-known<br />\nto all Johns Hopkins students as<br />\nthe head of the Physics Department, and equally well-known in<br />\nthe scientific world as a great physicist, undertook to explain the<br />\nfundamental principles of this<br />\nnew theory.<br />\nContrary to the impression of<br />\nthe general public, Einstein's law<br />\nof gravitation is not disproved,<br />\nbut is merely shown to be limited<br />\nto certain cases. Einstein's theory<br />\nis not limited to any particular<br />\ncases, it embraces all that could<br />\npossibly occur either on the planets or in space. When a body is<br />\nmoving slowly, and the speed of<br />\nthe earth and all planetary bodies<br />\nare comparatively slow, Einstein's<br />\ngeneral formula reduces to the<br />\nform of \"Newton's Law of Gravitation ;\" but with high speed bodies, such as light, no such reduction is possible, and this more intricate equation must be retained.<br />\nEinstein's method of arriving at<br />\nthese formulas or equations is different from that commonly employed. He does not attempt to<br />\ndeduce formulas or make explanations, but simply makes postui<br />\nlates and draws conclusions from<br />\nthem by means of mathematics.<br />\nThis method has two important<br />\ncharacteristics: First\u2014It leads to<br />\npredictions which no one would<br />\nhave looked for. Second\u2014Unless<br />\nthe theory is fulfilled, it is cast<br />\naway.<br />\nFollowing this method, Einstein<br />\narrived at the following postulates: First\u2014The Principle of<br />\nRelativity. Dr. Ames explained<br />\nthis principle by means of<br />\nthe railroad. Illustration: If<br />\ntwo trains are running along<br />\nat the same speed on parallel tracks, one train appears<br />\nstationary to an observer in the<br />\nother. If, however, the speed of<br />\none should change, the observer<br />\ncannot know which one did<br />\nchange, but can only note the relative change in speed. Second\u2014<br />\nNo matter what the source may<br />\nbe, light always has the same<br />\nvelocity. Third\u2014All observations<br />\nin nature are observations of coincidence.<br />\nThe position of a body is always<br />\ndetermined with reference to another. A scale of co-ordinates or ,<br />\n\u2022 a reference plane must be designated in order to definitely fix the<br />\nposition of a body.

Although this meet will not be as<br />\nlarge as the one held here on February 28 in the Fifth Regiment<br />\nArmory, there will be numerous<br />\nstars present, and some of the<br />\nevents should be very interesting.<br />\nDuring the past week the Hopkins<br />\nteam has been practicing whenever the weather permitted, and<br />\nwill continue to practice throughout this week.<br />\nAs there will be no South Atlantic relay race, members of the<br />\nBlack and Blue relay team will be<br />\nfree to take part in other events<br />\nand should furnish some excellent<br />\nentries for the quarter and half<br />\nmile runs, both open and South<br />\nAtlantic. Owing to the fact that<br />\nthe longest available straightaway<br />\non the Washington track is 50<br />\nyards, there will be no 100 or 220<br />\nyard events. This explains why<br />\nseveral men on the squad are not<br />\non the entry list.<br />\nDuring the past week the team<br />\nhas both gained and lost. Bartow<br />\nVan Ness who, because of a recent illness, was unable to take<br />\nfull part in the Armory meet, will<br />\nbe back on the job in the 440. At<br />\nthe same time, the black list has<br />\nbeen published, thus barring several men.from competitions.<br />\nThe list of Hopkins entries as<br />\nsent in by Manager Cox is as<br />\nfollows:<br /><br />\nIN THE YOUNG MEN'S SHOP\u2014<br />\nThe \"Carlton\"\u2014a new Spring Suit;<br />\nsingle-breasted, with patch pockets.<br />\nBALTIMORE'S BEST STORE<br /><br />\nAchochird,irchniefe<br />\nHOWARD AND LEXINGTON<br /><br />\nLiterary Club Notice.<br /><br />\nThe Literary Club is sorry to<br />\nannounce that \"Twinkle, Twinkle\"<br />\nis no more; the company has disBooth<br />\nTarkington's<br />\nbanded.<br />\n\"Poldekin\" wil be presented in its<br />\nstead with George Arliss in the<br />\nleading role.

Owing to<br />\nthe large number of letter men<br />\nwho are back and the abundance<br />\nof new material, the team promises to be entirely up to the standard set by teams of previous years.<br />\nWith the coming of warmer<br />\nweather the team should develop<br />\neven more rapidly, and by the<br />\ntime of the opening game against<br />\nCornell, which will be played at<br />\nHomewood on April 3, it should<br />\nbe in excellent condition.<br />\nA large number of last year's<br />\nstars have already reported at<br />\npractice, and still others are expected to show up later. Silberstein is back on the job at first attack, and Dougherty and Sadtler<br />\nwill probably hold down the position of goal.

Among the more promising<br />\nof these are Butler, \"Billy\" Hoffman, Melamet, Benedick, a former<br />\nCity College star, and A. V. D.<br />\nSmith, who was a member of the<br />\nNavy squad last year.<br />\nR. O. T. C.<br /><br />\nSix members of the R. 0. T.

The pictures of these<br />\nsand tables will be hung in the<br />\nmilitary rooms with the names of<br />\nthose who have made them attached to the pictures.<br /><br />\nOn last Tuesday, the Hopkins<br />\nundergraduate body, as well as<br />\nmany interested graduates and<br />\nprofessors enjoyed a lecture such<br />\nas but few are privileged to hear.<br />\n\"Einstein's Theory of Gravitation,\" so important, so far-reaching, and at the present time so<br />\nprominent, is thoroughly understood only by the mot advanced<br />\nmathematicians and physicists.<br />\nDr. Joseph S. Ames, well-known<br />\nto all Johns Hopkins students as<br />\nthe head of the Physics Department, and equally well-known in<br />\nthe scientific world as a great physicist, undertook to explain the<br />\nfundamental principles of this<br />\nnew theory.<br />\nContrary to the impression of<br />\nthe general public, Einstein's law<br />\nof gravitation is not disproved,<br />\nbut is merely shown to be limited<br />\nto certain cases. Einstein's theory<br />\nis not limited to any particular<br />\ncases, it embraces all that could<br />\npossibly occur either on the planets or in space. When a body is<br />\nmoving slowly, and the speed of<br />\nthe earth and all planetary bodies<br />\nare comparatively slow, Einstein's<br />\ngeneral formula reduces to the<br />\nform of \"Newton's Law of Gravitation ;\" but with high speed bodies, such as light, no such reduction is possible, and this more intricate equation must be retained.<br />\nEinstein's method of arriving at<br />\nthese formulas or equations is different from that commonly employed. He does not attempt to<br />\ndeduce formulas or make explanations, but simply makes postui<br />\nlates and draws conclusions from<br />\nthem by means of mathematics.<br />\nThis method has two important<br />\ncharacteristics: First\u2014It leads to<br />\npredictions which no one would<br />\nhave looked for. Second\u2014Unless<br />\nthe theory is fulfilled, it is cast<br />\naway.<br />\nFollowing this method, Einstein<br />\narrived at the following postulates: First\u2014The Principle of<br />\nRelativity. Dr. Ames explained<br />\nthis principle by means of<br />\nthe railroad. Illustration: If<br />\ntwo trains are running along<br />\nat the same speed on parallel tracks, one train appears<br />\nstationary to an observer in the<br />\nother. If, however, the speed of<br />\none should change, the observer<br />\ncannot know which one did<br />\nchange, but can only note the relative change in speed. Second\u2014<br />\nNo matter what the source may<br />\nbe, light always has the same<br />\nvelocity. Third\u2014All observations<br />\nin nature are observations of coincidence.<br />\nThe position of a body is always<br />\ndetermined with reference to another. A scale of co-ordinates or ,<br />\n\u2022 a reference plane must be designated in order to definitely fix the<br />\nposition of a body.
