we<br />\nhave not yet made up our minds<br />\nthat we are going to have a<br />\ndeficit,\" he continued.<br />\nMuller said that financial<br />\nofficers here are working towards<br />\na balanced

department has been<br />\nsuffering from a faculty shortage<br />\nsince the departure last Spring of<br />\nDr. Gregory Nagy, a tenured<br />\nSpecialist in Greek literature and<br />\nlinguistics.<br />\nThe problem became more<br />\nsevere last summer when Dr.<br />\nMarsh McCall, an associate<br />\nprofessor specializing in Greek<br />\ndrama, left Hopkins to accept a<br />\nPosition at Berkeley.<br />\nAt present, the department is<br />\nWithout a specialist in Greek<br />\ndrama or literature, creating a<br />\n<br />\npotentially serious shortage,<br />\naccording to Dr. James Poultney,<br />\nacting Chairman of Classics.<br />\n\"This shortage is rather bad<br />\nnow, because there is a lot of<br />\ninterest currently in Greek<br />\ndrama,\" he said.<br />\nPoultney indicated that he<br />\nwould like to see two additional<br />\nfaculty appointed\u2014one senior<br />\nand one junior professor.<br />\n\"We want at least one person<br />\nwho is not too young and who<br />\nhas become well-known for his<br />\npublications,\" he explained.<br />\nHe said he is optimistic that at<br />\nleast one appointment will be<br />\nmade by fall semester 1976,<br />\nthough \"it may take time for us<br />\nto get the second new professor.\"<br />\nOwen said the hiring of the<br />\nnew Classics faculty members is a<br />\nhigh priority. \"We can't afford to<br />\nlet the quality of this department<br />\nfall,\" he said. \"It's important<br />\nthat we get at least two people<br />\nready and active for next year.\"<br />\n<br />\nTo help with the faky<br />\nshortage, Poultney decided last<br />\nsummer to come out of<br />\nretirementand resume full-time<br />\nteaching duties as well as the<br />\nchairmanship of the department.<br />\nIn addition, the other Classics<br />\nfaculty have assumed additional<br />\nteaching loads to ensure that<br />\n\"enough courses are offered to<br />\naccomodate students,\" Poultney<br

adverse impact on the<br />\ndepartment's reputation or the<br />\nquality of its course offerings.<br />\n\"We have not been hurt by it this<br />\nyear, because we have been able<br />\nto make up

The train is on time, and<br />\nit is a comfortable ride<br />\nto the<br />\ndowntown station. The office is a<br />\nfew minutes walk from there,<br />\nand you arrive rested and in good<br />\nSpirits.<br />\nSuch is \"the commuter's<br />\ndream.\" But for those cities who<br />\nhave attempted to achieve this<br />\ntransportational nirvana, it has<br />\nbecome a fiscal nightmare.<br />\nAlthough the need for a Rapid<br />\nTransit System (RTS) is as<br />\nobvious as a tie-up on the Jones<br />\nFalls Expressway, the solutions<br />\nare not always as simple. In fact,<br />\nthe mere nature of the problem<br />\nitself is a factor in its insolubility.<br />\n<br />\nAt this time San Francisco is<br />\nthe only American city with a<br />\nnew RTS similar to the proposed<br />\nBaltimore system. Washington,<br />\nD. C.'s system is nearing<br />\ncompletion. But so far, neither<br />\nsystem has proved that it will be<br />\nthe solution it was intended to<br />\nbe.<br />\nThe first, and most striking<br />\nfailure of the San Francisco<br />\nsystem was that it did not work.<br />\nDesigned as a remotely<br />\ncontrolled, computerized<br />\nnetwork, the trains were to run<br />\nas if they were the life-size<br />\ncounterparts of a child's toy<br />\ntrains. As a safety precaution, a<br />\ntrained attendant was on each<br />\ntrain.<br />\nBut the computers did not<br />\nwork. There were scheduling<br />\nerrors, the emergency manual<br />\ncontrols did not function<br />\ncorrectly, and several collisions<br />\noccurred. Adjustments have been<br />\nmade to the system, but the<br />\ntrains are not operative at the<br />\noriginally proposed speeds.<br />\nMore important, there was no<br />\nreal reduction in the city's<br />\npassenger car flow. Even though<br />\nthe energy crises in recent<br />\nmonths have increased the<br />\nnumber of BART (Bay Area<br />\n<br />\nRapid Transit) travellers, the<br />\nnumbers still remain below the<br />\nprojected passenger flux.<br />\nOne possible reason for this<br />\nphenomenon may be the lack of<br />\nprivacy in today's society.<br />\nAccording to the Canadian media<br />\ntheorist, Marshall McLuhan,<br />\nmass transit systems will never<br />\nwork in an urbanized society, as<br />\none's car remains as the last place<br />\nwhere one can be alone.<br />\nConsequently, the city dweller<br />\nwill resist giving up his car for<br />\nRTS, no matter how attractive<br />\nthe system may be.<br />\n<br />\nTuition madness<br />\n<br />\nOther hikes are worse than ours<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nWhile tuition at Hopkins will<br />\ngo up $200 next year, most other<br />\nNortheastern private schools<br />\nexpect to raise fees considerably<br />\nmore than that.<br />\nTuition at Princeton<br />\nUniversity may go up next year<br />\nas much as $600 over the present<br />\n$3600 level, while officials at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania plan<br />\nto increase their $3790 tuition<br />\nten percent every year for the<br />\nnext five years, at least.<br />\nBrown University, which<br />\nraised tuition $400 last year, also<br />\nexpects to go over the $4000<br />\nmark next year.<br />\nAt Columbia University,<br />\ntuition may go up as much as<br />\n$500 over the present $3732 fee,<br />\nWhile Yale University officials are<br />\ncontemplating increasing the<br />\nschool's present tuition fee of<br />\n$4050 to $4550.<br />\nThough fiscal officers at these<br />\nschools predict that this year's<br />\ntuition hike will be followed by<br />\nsimilar if not larger raises in<br />\nsubsequent years, reaction to the<br />\ntuition action is expected to be<br />\nuniformly mild.<br />\nBrown University was the<br />\nfocus of a major protest last<br />\nSpring. However, next year's<br />\ntuition figure will not \"prompt<br />\nany building takeovers,\"<br />\naccording to Mike Silverstein of<br />\nthe Brown Daily Herald.<br />\n\"Since the president of the<br />\nUniversity resigned this summer,<br />\na lot of steam was taken out of<br />\nthe movement. However, last<br />\nyear's protest leaders are still<br />\nPreparing for action. Clearly, the<br />\nstudent body will express its<br />\ndissatisfaction,\" he added.<br />\nLikewise, the tuition hike at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania is<br />\n<br />\nexpected to bring little reSponse.<br />\nLast year, recalls Larry Field,<br />\neditor of the Daily<br />\nPennsylvanian, demonstrations<br />\nwere minor. \"There were only<br />\nfifteen students at one rally. But<br />\nan attempt is being made to<br />\norganize and plan some action. If<br />\nthe demonstrations are<br />\nlow-leveled, there will be no<br />\neffect on the adminsitration's<br />\ndecision.\"<br />\nEven less reaction is expected<br />\nat Columbia and Yale. \"Two<br />\nyears ago was the last time there<br />\nwas any activity. Now no one is<br />\ncomplaining\u2014I think people will<br />\ntake it lying down,\" stated David<br />\nRaab of the Columbia Spectator.<br />\nAt Yale,\"there was no student<br />\nreaction last year because it was<br />\n<br />\nuseless to protest a fait<br />\naccompli,\" said a member of the<br />\nYale Daily News. \"No action is<br />\nexpected this year either.\"<br />\nA strong justification for<br />\ntuition increases at these major<br />\ninstitutions is budget deficits.<br />\n\"At Brown, operating expenses<br />\nare greater than revenue at this<br />\ntime,\" states Silverstein. Though<br />\nthe university expects to gain<br />\nfinancial equilibrium in two<br />\nyears, severe cuts have been made<br />\nin the number of faculty.<br />\nMoreover, the feeling on<br />\ncampus, explains Silverstein, is<br />\nthat \"the people coming to<br />\nBrown aren't as economically<br />\ndiverse. Financial aid has not<br />\nseemed to keep up with tuition<br />\nhikes.\"<br />\n<br />\nCharles Center Interior Perspective<br />\nWhile the San Francisco<br />\nsystem illustrates one set of RTS<br />\nproblems, Washington's still<br />\nuncompleted system presents yet<br />\nanother.<br />\nWashington, D. C., home of<br />\nthe fiscal boondoggle, should be<br />\nproud of its subway system, if its<br />\npresent ability to lose money is<br />\nany indication of its future. The<br />\ncost of building the subway<br />\nsystem has long since overrun the<br />\noriginal estimates, and the<br />\nsurplus cost will no doubt be<br />\nreminiscent of the C-5A and the<br />\nF-1 11 government contracts.<br />\nThe principal reason for the<br />\ntremendous cost overruns has<br />\nbeen inflation. But that most<br />\nobvious of causes is compounded<br />\nby other, less obvious factors.<br />\nIn order to build an RTS,<br />\nplanning must begin many years<br />\nin advance. In the case of the<br />\nBaltimore system, planning began<br />\nin 1961, and a projected date of<br />\ncompletion set at 1980. It would<br />\nbe unrealistic for any projected<br />\ncost to be accurate ten to fifteen<br />\nyears from the time of<br />\nconstruction is scheduled to take<br />\nplace.<br />\nAlong with the increased cost<br />\ncomes the matter of funding, or,<br />\nspecifically, the correction of<br />\ndeficit spending. Although a large<br />\nportion of any RTS's budget is<br />\nsupplied by the Federal<br />\nGovernment, the cost overruns<br />\nmust be absorbed at a local level.<br />\nFor Washington, as well as<br />\nBaltimore, that support must<br />\ncome from the State as well as<br />\n<br />\nlocal county governments.<br />\nUnfortunately for Washington,<br />\nits projected losses have already<br />\ncaused Montgomery and Prince<br />\nGeorge's Counties to withdraw<br />\ntheir support from the program.<br />\nAnd Baltimore has already been<br />\ninformed that the government of<br />\nAnne Arundel County would<br />\nprefer to go without a part of its<br />\nRTS.<br />\nFurthermore, Maryland<br />\nGovernor Marvin Mandel has<br />\nmade public mention of the<br />\nState's lack of desire to take up<br />\nthe monetary slack created by<br />\nthe two RTS's.<br />\nThe most recent development<br />\nin funding was last Thurday's<br />\nannouncement by Lt. Governor<br />\nBalir Lee that the cost of<br />\nbuilding Baltimore's RTS would<br />\nput a stop to all highway<br />\nconstruction in the State of<br />\nMaryland, due to a lack of<br />\nfunding.<br />\nPerhaps the most bothersome<br />\nproblem that will arise from the<br />\nnew RTS system will be the<br />\ntraffic problems arising from the<br />\nconstruction of a subway system.<br />\nOver the past several years,<br />\nWashington has become a maze<br />\nof detours and wood-plank<br />\nstreets.<br />\nAn early projection of<br />\nBaltimore's construction<br />\nestimated that the downtown<br />\nconstruction would tie up traffic<br />\nfor five years.<br />\nNext week: Local Support and<br />\nOpinion.<br />\n<br />\nUnion Desk working to defray deficit<br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\nThe Union Desk will try to<br />\ngenerate surplus revenues this<br />\nyear in order to compensate for a<br />\nsubstantial deficit incurred its<br />\n<br />\nfirst year of operation.<br />\nThe Desk now has a deficit of<br />\nabout $16 thousand outstanding,<br />\naccording to SC president Mike<br />\nLenardo.<br />\n<br />\nThe Union Desk<br />\n<br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nChris Columbo, who is in charge<br />\nof the Desk, said that the Desk<br />\nhad run a significant deficit, but<br />\ncould not cite a specific figure<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nLast year, the Desk made a<br />\nsmall profit of about $1000,<br />\nwhich partially alleviated the<br />\ndeficit incurred in the preceding<br />\nyear.<br />\nOne of the new policies that is<br />\ndesigned to help defray the Desk's<br />\ndeficit has drawn substantial<br />\nprotests from students.<br />\nThe new policy places a<br />\n\u2022 surcharge of five percent on<br />\nticket sales for student groups,<br />\ncu<br />\nk_<br />\nwhich previously could have their<br />\ntickets sold without charge.<br />\n\"The desk was originally set<br />\ntr,<br />\nup as a student service.

Despite its appearance,<br />\nthe hike is a relatively small one, considering that it is only an<br />\nincrease of six per cent at a time when inflation is expected<br />\nto run anywhere from 8 to 14 per cent. Moreover, it is a<br />\nsmall raise in relation to other major Universities and colleges.<br />\nwhich plan to up their tuition fees at a rate of about 10%.<br />\nHopkins' decision to raise tuition only S200 when an<br />\nincrease of $300 or $400 could easily have been justified<br />\nindicates that the University is beginning to seriously<br />\nconsider the possibility of holding the line on tuition for the<br />\nnext few years.

So, for<br />\none week, I listened to all that<br />\nsale bullshit about \"selling<br />\nyourself.\" However, after those<br />\nfirst five days, I had not yet<br />\nlearned exactly what the product.<br />\nwas that I'd be selling.

But<br />\nmaybe you're just taking the<br />\nblood-sucking tendencies of a<br />\nUniversity for granted.<br />\nFor the sake of clarification,<br />\nlet's look at a simpler situation<br />\nanalagous to this school's tuition<br />\nsystem. Suppose I decide to<br />\nenroll in a ballroom dancing<br />\nschool for the advertised rate of<br />\n$10 per lesson. My objective is to<br />\neventually learn the fox trot,<br />\nrumba and tango. However, in<br />\nthe first lesson, I am only taught<br />\nhow to distinguish the different<br />\ntypes of dance music. Maybe in<br />\nthe next lesson I learn to follow<br />\nthe footprints. Yet, by the third<br />\nsession, I'm told the cost of<br />\nlessons have gone up to $15.<br />\nWhat am I going to do? Forget<br />\nabout the $20 I've already<br />\ninvested or pay the increase and<br />\ncontinue the lessons? I'd probably<br />\ndo the latter and by the next to<br />\nthe last lesson I'd be even more<br />\nlikely to pay for yet another<br />\nincrease.<br />\nNow that's entrapment, you<br />\nsay, and I should take that lousy<br />\nstudio to court. Then let's<br />\ngraduate from 'analogies to the<br />\nreal thing. I enter Hopkins in '72<br />\nand tuition costs $2700. One<br />\nyear later that goes up to $3000<br />\nand by the time I graduate, the<br />\nante goes up $300 more.<br />\nYes, Dr. Christ, I know about<br />\ninflation and the rising-costs-to-educate. But what if students like<br />\nme are paying for their tuition<br />\nout of a fixed income, namely<br />\nsavings bank deposits, or what if<br />\n.the salaries of other students'<br />\nparents have not risen along with<br />\nthe annual inflation rate? What<br />\nare we to do? We're trapped.<br />\nWe could take the University<br />\nto court for the entrapment, but<br />\nwe'd be sure to lose. Why?<br />\nBecause the judge would say<br />\nthere's nothing stopping us from<br />\ntransferring from Hopkins to<br />\nState U. or Community College<br />\nor any other form of lower<br />\npriced education.<br />\nBut are we so free to transfer?<br />\nWe wouldn't have applied to<br />\nHopkins in the first place if we<br />\ndidn't seek the advantages a<br />\nPrivate University offers over a<br />\nPublic one.

Earlier in the day,<br />\nhe had to explain to a local TV<br />\ntalk show host that \"comic<br />\nbooks are heavy.\" The audience<br />\nhere needed no convincing. Lee<br />\nsoon realized he was not in alien<br />\nterritory; he warmed to the<br />\ncrowd, bringing with him and<br />\ngenerating more enthusiasm than<br />\nany other symposium speaker in<br />\nrecent memory, especially last<br />\nThursday's.<br />\nFrom the age of 17 on, Lee<br />\nwrote story lines for comic books<br />\nas well as ad copy and radio<br />\nPlays.

Lee's revolutionary<br />\nconcept was to invent a new line<br />\nof superheroes, as excitini; as<br />\nestablished figures such as<br />\nSuperman and Batman but with<br />\nmore human, more complex<br />\npersonalities. The year was 1960.<br />\nThe industry was in the<br />\ndoldrums.

A<br />\nman who is, in his own words,<br />\n\"hooked on reality,\" Lee created<br />\nnaturalistic but witty dialogue<br />\nwhich was unlike the stilted,<br />\nh3ckneyed style of the<br />\ncompetition.

And<br />\nnever again would Sonny, the<br />\nPeripatetic proprietor, snare<br />\nInnumerable Battaglia-isms.<br />\nFrom dust it came and to dust<br />\nthe \"Beem\" returned, but from<br />\nits ashes rose Judy's, the<br />\nPhoenix, two weeks ago. I had to<br />\nbe skeptical. Any place trying to<br />\nsupplant the old B & M had some<br />\ndirty, smelly shoes to fill. My<br />\ncuriosity led me to the hallowed<br />\ncorner a short while ago and to<br />\nirlY surprise, Sonny's dirty old<br />\nsmelly cellar had metamorphosed<br />\ninto the swan of yore. Clean<br />\nWhite ceiling, clean floor, clean<br />\nShelves. What happened to the B<br />\n& M, whose dirt and muck<br />\ncollection was among Baltimore's<br />\nfinest; I still had to adjust my<br />\nstature to accomodate the<br />\nCurvaceous roof reminiscent of<br />\nsome undulating Iowa hills, and<br />\n<br />\nstill I bumped my head, as<br />\nalways, but only once.<br />\nMy memory was a bit foggy. I<br />\ncould not recall the exact layout<br />\nof Sonny's B & M. But sure as<br />\nmy breath reeks of onions, the B<br />\n& M's seed had not been dormant<br />\nsince February, but had been<br />\nbusy germinating all summer and<br />\nwas now in fall flower as Judy's .<br />\nTalking with Bill, the \"maitre'd\"<br />\nthere, I found that Judy's was<br />\nnamed after the daughter of the<br />\nnew owner, Charles Lambert, a<br />\nrestauranteur from southwest<br />\nBaltimore. Indeed Bill and<br />\nLambert had been busy all<br />\nsummer refurbishing the old<br />\nBeem. Over a cup of coffee Bill<br />\nrevealed that in many ways<br />\nSonny's spirit resides still, though<br />\nin a more sanitized state.<br />\nHave your choice of three<br />\nkinds of hot dogs\u2014regular,<br />\nkosher, or Polish\u2014for forty to<br />\nsixty cents. Bill restored my faith<br />\nthat for a buck one can still<br />\npartake like a king or a pig or<br />\nboth, in food that, for quality<br />\nand quantity, should shame the<br />\nRathskellar. And it does. Whereas<br />\na dollar spent on Saga fare can<br />\n<br />\nbarely dent my hunger, the same<br />\nbill at Judy's can keep my<br />\nstomach pangs on the run for<br />\nseveral hours.<br />\nThe refrigerators are still a bit<br />\nbarren, but one must understand<br />\nthat a two-week old<br />\nestablishment cannot be<br />\nexpected to house full bins.<br />\nDeviled eggs are not there yet,<br />\nand I do not miss them, but they<br />\nare a on the way. Lacking is<br />\npastrami, my favorite, but it too<br />\nwill be on the shelves shortly, as<br />\nsoon as Judy's supplier decides to<br />\n<br />\nstop between Eddie's and<br />\nGreenmount. Judy's seems to<br />\nhave more beer on hand than<br />\nanything else. Is she expecting to<br />\nbe the lone supplier when ATO<br />\nruns out of beer at their next<br />\nparty? Methinks not. The Village<br />\nis full of thirsty folk, and what<br />\nwith a fresh Colts season on<br />\nhand, a hefty arsenal of spiritous<br />\nfermenti is not only desirable,<br />\nbut imperative.(However, do not<br />\nforget the Bawlamer Blue Laws:<br />\nno booze on the Sabbath.)<br />\nUnlike the old Beem, Judy's<br />\n<br />\nJudy's Confectionary & Carry Out<br />\n<br />\nhas a modest grocery section.<br />\nThough the prices are a bit higher<br />\nthan our friend Eddie's, you<br />\nmust give this small place credit<br />\nfor the innovation. A<br />\ndollar-eighty may sound stiff for<br />\na gallon of milk, but consider<br />\nthat Lambert will only make<br />\nthirteen cents on each carton.<br />\nAnd try buying milk at Eddie's at<br />\nten p.m.<br />\nI liked everything about<br />\nJudy's. They have even<br />\nconstructed a little grating at the<br />\nbottom of the stairwell entrance<br />\nto keep your feet dry when it<br />\nrains. We who have gone to the B<br />\n& M on such a day and been<br />\ngreeted by a shoeful of water<br />\nthere will surely appreciate the<br />\nthought. My only criticism,<br />\nthough is that Judy's is only<br />\nopen until ten p.m. seven days a<br />\nweek. But this is on a trial basis<br />\nand the hours may be extended if<br />\nsufficient interest arises. We<br />\nwould all do well to invest a buck<br />\nfor a junior sub in support of<br />\nwhat may become another<br />\nVillage establishment. Sonny's<br />\ndirty smelly shoes have been<br />\nfilled, and filled well.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letterioctober 14, 1975<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins Press announces its fall publications<br />\nW.

No less than<br />\nfive Blue Jay scoring<br />\nopportunities were thwarted by<br />\nHopkins' own mistakes, four<br />\noccuring in the first half which<br />\nended with the Jays on the short<br />\nend of a 7-0 score.<br />\nUrsinus wasted no time in<br />\ntallying their lone points of the<br />\nday as they drove 63 yards on<br />\nthirteen plays to score on their<br />\nfirst possession. In that drive, the<br />\nBears' utilized strong blocking on<br />\nthe right side of their offensive<br />\nline to open gaping holes for<br />\nrunning backs Mike Golz and<br />\nDave Fischer. Highlights in the<br />\ndrive which culminated in a 14<br />\nyard touchdown by Golz<br />\nincluded two crucial third down<br />\nconversions by Fischer.<br />\nHopkins' efforts to strike back<br />\nin the first half were time and<br />\nagain precluded by their own<br />\nmistakes. On the first possession<br />\nfollowing the Ursinus<br />\ntouchdown, the Blue Jays drove<br />\ndeep into Bear territory only to<br />\nhave a Dave Emala pass<br />\nintercepted by an Ursinus<br />\nlinebacker.<br />\nIn the closing minutes of the<br />\nfirst quarter, some hard and<br />\ndetermined running by Jerry<br />\nFaraino, John Coad and<br />\nfreshman Mike Jurgenson went<br />\n<br />\nfor naught as Emala's pass<br />\nintended for Joey Devlin was<br />\nintercepted by defensive back<br />\nMike Gordon. The nightmare did<br />\nnot end here. In their next<br />\npossession, a 17 yard completion<br />\nfrom Emala to Devlin was<br />\nfollowed by a fumble by Pinky<br />\nNorbeck following an excellent<br />\nrun by the senior co-captain.<br />\nThe story then was all the<br />\nHopkins' defense in the first half<br />\nwhich consistently stopped the<br />\nBears' attack.<br />\nThe Jay's came out of the<br />\nlocker room fired up and<br />\nmounted a strong offensive drive<br />\non their first possession in the<br />\nsecond half. Following a 23-yard<br />\nkickoff return by Jurgenson,<br />\nEmala spearheaded a drive to the<br />\nBear 23, calling his own number<br />\non numerous occasions. A<br />\n<br />\n20-yard keeper to the Ursinus 35<br />\nwas followed by an apparent<br />\ncompletion to Jerry Faraino,<br />\ncalled back however for illegal<br />\nprocedure by the Jays.<br />\nForced to punt, the Jays<br />\ndefense then came up with<br />\nanother spectacular effort as on<br />\nthe first Ursinus play, Fischer<br />\nwas hit hard and fumbled into<br />\nthe hands of linebacker John<br />\nNutting, a four year Hopkins'<br />\nstarter who enjoyed one of his<br />\nfinest afternoons despite coming<br />\noff a painful neck injury.<br />\nAt last, the Hopkins' offense<br />\ntook the cue and drove the ball<br />\n24 yards in nine plays to make<br />\nthe score 7-6.

D. CONSIDINE<br />\nLast week, the News-Letter<br />\nbegan its series on the proposed<br />\nRapid Transit System which<br />\nBaltimore plans to implement.<br />\nThis article will examine some of<br />\nthe problems faced by any Rapid<br />\nTransit System.<br />\nIt is 8:10, and you just pull<br />\ninto the parking lot. Quickly<br />\nparking your car, you grab your<br />\nbriefcase and head for the station.<br />\nTaking $.25 from your pocket<br />\nyou buy your ticket, and en<br />\nroute to the train, you pick up<br />\nthe morning paper.<br />\nThe station is modern and<br />\nSpotless. The train is on time, and<br />\nit is a comfortable ride<br />\nto the<br />\ndowntown station. The office is a<br />\nfew minutes walk from there,<br />\nand you arrive rested and in good<br />\nSpirits.<br />\nSuch is \"the commuter's<br />\ndream.\" But for those cities who<br />\nhave attempted to achieve this<br />\ntransportational nirvana, it has<br />\nbecome a fiscal nightmare.<br />\nAlthough the need for a Rapid<br />\nTransit System (RTS) is as<br />\nobvious as a tie-up on the Jones<br />\nFalls Expressway, the solutions<br />\nare not always as simple. In fact,<br />\nthe mere nature of the problem<br />\nitself is a factor in its insolubility.<br /><br />\nAt this time San Francisco is<br />\nthe only American city with a<br />\nnew RTS similar to the proposed<br />\nBaltimore system. Washington,<br />\nD. C.'s system is nearing<br />\ncompletion. But so far, neither<br />\nsystem has proved that it will be<br />\nthe solution it was intended to<br />\nbe.<br />\nThe first, and most striking<br />\nfailure of the San Francisco<br />\nsystem was that it did not work.<br />\nDesigned as a remotely<br />\ncontrolled, computerized<br />\nnetwork, the trains were to run<br />\nas if they were the life-size<br />\ncounterparts of a child's toy<br />\ntrains. As a safety precaution, a<br />\ntrained attendant was on each<br />\ntrain.<br />\nBut the computers did not<br />\nwork. There were scheduling<br />\nerrors, the emergency manual<br />\ncontrols did not function<br />\ncorrectly, and several collisions<br />\noccurred. Adjustments have been<br />\nmade to the system, but the<br />\ntrains are not operative at the<br />\noriginally proposed speeds.<br />\nMore important, there was no<br />\nreal reduction in the city's<br />\npassenger car flow. Even though<br />\nthe energy crises in recent<br />\nmonths have increased the<br />\nnumber of BART (Bay Area<br /><br />\nRapid Transit) travellers, the<br />\nnumbers still remain below the<br />\nprojected passenger flux.<br />\nOne possible reason for this<br />\nphenomenon may be the lack of<br />\nprivacy in today's society.<br />\nAccording to the Canadian media<br />\ntheorist, Marshall McLuhan,<br />\nmass transit systems will never<br />\nwork in an urbanized society, as<br />\none's car remains as the last place<br />\nwhere one can be alone.<br />\nConsequently, the city dweller<br />\nwill resist giving up his car for<br />\nRTS, no matter how attractive<br />\nthe system may be.<br /><br />\nTuition madness<br /><br />\nOther hikes are worse than ours<br />\nBy JAN HAMMERMAN<br />\nWhile tuition at Hopkins will<br />\ngo up $200 next year, most other<br />\nNortheastern private schools<br />\nexpect to raise fees considerably<br />\nmore than that.<br />\nTuition at Princeton<br />\nUniversity may go up next year<br />\nas much as $600 over the present<br />\n$3600 level, while officials at the<br />\nUniversity of Pennsylvania plan<br />\nto increase their $3790 tuition<br />\nten percent every year for the<br />\nnext five years, at least.<br />\nBrown University, which<br />\nraised tuition $400 last year, also<br />\nexpects to go over the $4000<br />\nmark next year.<br />\nAt Columbia University,<br />\ntuition may go up as much as<br />\n$500 over the present $3732 fee,<br />\nWhile Yale University officials are<br />\ncontemplating increasing the<br />\nschool's present tuition fee of<br />\n$4050 to $4550.<br />\nThough fiscal officers at these<br />\nschools predict that this year's<br />\ntuition hike will be followed by<br />\nsimilar if not larger raises in<br />\nsubsequent years, reaction to the<br />\ntuition action is expected to be<br />\nuniformly mild.<br />\nBrown University was the<br />\nfocus of a major protest last<br />\nSpring. However, next year's<br />\ntuition figure will not \"prompt<br />\nany building takeovers,\"<br />\naccording to Mike Silverstein of<br />\nthe Brown Daily Herald.<br />\n\"Since the president of the<br />\nUniversity resigned this summer,<br />\na lot of steam was taken out of<br />\nthe movement. However, last<br />\nyear's protest leaders are still<br />\nPreparing for action. Clearly, the<br />\nstudent body will express its<br />\ndissatisfaction,\" he added.<br />\nLikewise, the tuition hike at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania is<br /><br />\nexpected to bring little reSponse.<br />\nLast year, recalls Larry Field,<br />\neditor of the Daily<br />\nPennsylvanian, demonstrations<br />\nwere minor. \"There were only<br />\nfifteen students at one rally. But<br />\nan attempt is being made to<br />\norganize and plan some action. If<br />\nthe demonstrations are<br />\nlow-leveled, there will be no<br />\neffect on the adminsitration's<br />\ndecision.\"<br />\nEven less reaction is expected<br />\nat Columbia and Yale. \"Two<br />\nyears ago was the last time there<br />\nwas any activity. Now no one is<br />\ncomplaining\u2014I think people will<br />\ntake it lying down,\" stated David<br />\nRaab of the Columbia Spectator.<br />\nAt Yale,\"there was no student<br />\nreaction last year because it was<br /><br />\nuseless to protest a fait<br />\naccompli,\" said a member of the<br />\nYale Daily News. \"No action is<br />\nexpected this year either.\"<br />\nA strong justification for<br />\ntuition increases at these major<br />\ninstitutions is budget deficits.<br />\n\"At Brown, operating expenses<br />\nare greater than revenue at this<br />\ntime,\" states Silverstein. Though<br />\nthe university expects to gain<br />\nfinancial equilibrium in two<br />\nyears, severe cuts have been made<br />\nin the number of faculty.<br />\nMoreover, the feeling on<br />\ncampus, explains Silverstein, is<br />\nthat \"the people coming to<br />\nBrown aren't as economically<br />\ndiverse. Financial aid has not<br />\nseemed to keep up with tuition<br />\nhikes.\"<br /><br />\nCharles Center Interior Perspective<br />\nWhile the San Francisco<br />\nsystem illustrates one set of RTS<br />\nproblems, Washington's still<br />\nuncompleted system presents yet<br />\nanother.<br />\nWashington, D. C., home of<br />\nthe fiscal boondoggle, should be<br />\nproud of its subway system, if its<br />\npresent ability to lose money is<br />\nany indication of its future. The<br />\ncost of building the subway<br />\nsystem has long since overrun the<br />\noriginal estimates, and the<br />\nsurplus cost will no doubt be<br />\nreminiscent of the C-5A and the<br />\nF-1 11 government contracts.<br />\nThe principal reason for the<br />\ntremendous cost overruns has<br />\nbeen inflation. But that most<br />\nobvious of causes is compounded<br />\nby other, less obvious factors.<br />\nIn order to build an RTS,<br />\nplanning must begin many years<br />\nin advance. In the case of the<br />\nBaltimore system, planning began<br />\nin 1961, and a projected date of<br />\ncompletion set at 1980. It would<br />\nbe unrealistic for any projected<br />\ncost to be accurate ten to fifteen<br />\nyears from the time of<br />\nconstruction is scheduled to take<br />\nplace.<br />\nAlong with the increased cost<br />\ncomes the matter of funding, or,<br />\nspecifically, the correction of<br />\ndeficit spending. Although a large<br />\nportion of any RTS's budget is<br />\nsupplied by the Federal<br />\nGovernment, the cost overruns<br />\nmust be absorbed at a local level.<br />\nFor Washington, as well as<br />\nBaltimore, that support must<br />\ncome from the State as well as<br /><br />\nlocal county governments.<br />\nUnfortunately for Washington,<br />\nits projected losses have already<br />\ncaused Montgomery and Prince<br />\nGeorge's Counties to withdraw<br />\ntheir support from the program.<br />\nAnd Baltimore has already been<br />\ninformed that the government of<br />\nAnne Arundel County would<br />\nprefer to go without a part of its<br />\nRTS.<br />\nFurthermore, Maryland<br />\nGovernor Marvin Mandel has<br />\nmade public mention of the<br />\nState's lack of desire to take up<br />\nthe monetary slack created by<br />\nthe two RTS's.<br />\nThe most recent development<br />\nin funding was last Thurday's<br />\nannouncement by Lt. Governor<br />\nBalir Lee that the cost of<br />\nbuilding Baltimore's RTS would<br />\nput a stop to all highway<br />\nconstruction in the State of<br />\nMaryland, due to a lack of<br />\nfunding.<br />\nPerhaps the most bothersome<br />\nproblem that will arise from the<br />\nnew RTS system will be the<br />\ntraffic problems arising from the<br />\nconstruction of a subway system.<br />\nOver the past several years,<br />\nWashington has become a maze<br />\nof detours and wood-plank<br />\nstreets.<br />\nAn early projection of<br />\nBaltimore's construction<br />\nestimated that the downtown<br />\nconstruction would tie up traffic<br />\nfor five years.<br />\nNext week: Local Support and<br />\nOpinion.<br /><br />\nUnion Desk working to defray deficit<br />\nBy BOB BUCHANAN<br />\nThe Union Desk will try to<br />\ngenerate surplus revenues this<br />\nyear in order to compensate for a<br />\nsubstantial deficit incurred its<br /><br />\nfirst year of operation.<br />\nThe Desk now has a deficit of<br />\nabout $16 thousand outstanding,<br />\naccording to SC president Mike<br />\nLenardo.<br /><br />\nThe Union Desk<br /><br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nChris Columbo, who is in charge<br />\nof the Desk, said that the Desk<br />\nhad run a significant deficit, but<br />\ncould not cite a specific figure<br />\nyesterday.<br />\nLast year, the Desk made a<br />\nsmall profit of about $1000,<br />\nwhich partially alleviated the<br />\ndeficit incurred in the preceding<br />\nyear.<br />\nOne of the new policies that is<br />\ndesigned to help defray the Desk's<br />\ndeficit has drawn substantial<br />\nprotests from students.<br />\nThe new policy places a<br />\n\u2022 surcharge of five percent on<br />\nticket sales for student groups,<br />\ncu<br />\nk_<br />\nwhich previously could have their<br />\ntickets sold without charge.<br />\n\"The desk was originally set<br />\ntr,<br />\nup as a student service. It is<br />\nridiculous to have students<br /><br />\ncharging other students to run a<br />\nservice at Hopkins,\" said<br />\nLenardo.<br />\nColumbo stated, however,<br />\n\"Mike [Lenardol sees this as a<br />\nstudent service.

Despite its appearance,<br />\nthe hike is a relatively small one, considering that it is only an<br />\nincrease of six per cent at a time when inflation is expected<br />\nto run anywhere from 8 to 14 per cent. Moreover, it is a<br />\nsmall raise in relation to other major Universities and colleges.<br />\nwhich plan to up their tuition fees at a rate of about 10%.<br />\nHopkins' decision to raise tuition only S200 when an<br />\nincrease of $300 or $400 could easily have been justified<br />\nindicates that the University is beginning to seriously<br />\nconsider the possibility of holding the line on tuition for the<br />\nnext few years.

Make $5<br />\nPer Hour.\" The first day I<br />\nreported for work, I found out<br />\nthat I would need sonic training<br />\nbefore I could be paid for selling.<br />\nThat sounded reasonable. So, for<br />\none week, I listened to all that<br />\nsale bullshit about \"selling<br />\nyourself.\" However, after those<br />\nfirst five days, I had not yet<br />\nlearned exactly what the product.<br />\nwas that I'd be selling. In fact,<br />\nnot until three weeks later did I<br />\nfinally discover that the<br />\n\"revolutionary new product\" was<br />\na $400 vacuum cleaner.<br />\nI was mad as hell\u2014especially at<br />\nmyself for sticking around so<br />\nlong without pay. But, I was also<br />\ntrapped. I had already invested so<br />\nmuch time in the job, I was<br />\nforced to make a go of it, which<br />\nmeant selling three vacuum<br />\ncleaners a week in order to make<br />\nthe advertised $5 per hour. So I<br />\nwent out and pushed their<br />\nfucking over-priced machine to<br />\nan extent that will haunt my<br />\nconscience for the rest of my<br />\ndays.<br />\nA lawyer friend would later<br />\nexplain to me that I had been<br />\nsucked into selling vacuum<br />\ncleaners by illegal means which<br />\nlawyers call, ENTRAPMENT. I<br />\nswore never to be so suckered<br />\nagain and then promptly handed<br />\na portion of those ill-gotten gains<br />\nover to the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, and just as promptly I<br />\nwas trapped once more.<br />\nI'm afraid that I don't<br />\nunderstand all the legal<br />\nramifications of entrapment, but<br />\nI'm still convinced that the word<br />\napplies to my relationship with<br />\nthis University. As soon as I<br />\nregistered for the first semester,<br />\ndidn't I fall into a financial pit;<br />\nthe depth of which would be<br /><br />\ndetermined by the tender mercies<br />\nof the College Administration?<br />\nI'm exaggerating, you say. But<br />\nmaybe you're just taking the<br />\nblood-sucking tendencies of a<br />\nUniversity for granted.<br />\nFor the sake of clarification,<br />\nlet's look at a simpler situation<br />\nanalagous to this school's tuition<br />\nsystem. Suppose I decide to<br />\nenroll in a ballroom dancing<br />\nschool for the advertised rate of<br />\n$10 per lesson. My objective is to<br />\neventually learn the fox trot,<br />\nrumba and tango. However, in<br />\nthe first lesson, I am only taught<br />\nhow to distinguish the different<br />\ntypes of dance music. Maybe in<br />\nthe next lesson I learn to follow<br />\nthe footprints. Yet, by the third<br />\nsession, I'm told the cost of<br />\nlessons have gone up to $15.<br />\nWhat am I going to do? Forget<br />\nabout the $20 I've already<br />\ninvested or pay the increase and<br />\ncontinue the lessons? I'd probably<br />\ndo the latter and by the next to<br />\nthe last lesson I'd be even more<br />\nlikely to pay for yet another<br />\nincrease.<br />\nNow that's entrapment, you<br />\nsay, and I should take that lousy<br />\nstudio to court. Then let's<br />\ngraduate from 'analogies to the<br />\nreal thing. I enter Hopkins in '72<br />\nand tuition costs $2700. One<br />\nyear later that goes up to $3000<br />\nand by the time I graduate, the<br />\nante goes up $300 more.<br />\nYes, Dr. Christ, I know about<br />\ninflation and the rising-costs-to-educate. But what if students like<br />\nme are paying for their tuition<br />\nout of a fixed income, namely<br />\nsavings bank deposits, or what if<br />\n.the salaries of other students'<br />\nparents have not risen along with<br />\nthe annual inflation rate? What<br />\nare we to do? We're trapped.<br />\nWe could take the University<br />\nto court for the entrapment, but<br />\nwe'd be sure to lose. Why?<br />\nBecause the judge would say<br />\nthere's nothing stopping us from<br />\ntransferring from Hopkins to<br />\nState U. or Community College<br />\nor any other form of lower<br />\npriced education.<br />\nBut are we so free to transfer?<br />\nWe wouldn't have applied to<br />\nHopkins in the first place if we<br />\ndidn't seek the advantages a<br />\nPrivate University offers over a<br />\nPublic one. Besides, after one<br /><br />\nDavid Porter<br /><br />\nThE<br /><br />\nTrustees leaving<br /><br />\nyear, we're already to ensconced<br />\nin department majors, social<br />\ncircles and university<br />\nrequirements, who's willing to<br />\ntransfer and start all over again?<br />\nThat's what's .so morally<br />\nrepugnant about University<br />\nentrapment. They can get away<br />\nwith it legally, so they're only<br />\ntoo happy to turn the screws on<br />\nus for all we're worth.<br />\nSo how, you ask, can the<br />\nUniversity meet rising costs and<br />\nkeep everyone happy? At least<br />\nthey can offer every incoming<br />\nfreshman a four-year guaranteed<br />\ntuition rate, so that each person<br />\ncould decide before they're<br />\ntrapped, whether or not they can<br />\na fford,.\u2022 four years of private<br />\neducation.<br />\nBut a four year guaranteed<br />\ntuition is only the least they<br />\ncould do, because the way things<br />\nare going now, Hopkins is pricing<br />\nitself out of the range of even<br />\nmiddle-income families. Only so<br />\nmuch blood can be squeezed<br />\nfrom the stone before this<br />\nUniversity becomes a school for<br />\nthe very rich and the very poor.<br />\nThe real solution lies in the<br />\noutrageous juxtaposition of<br />\narticles in the September 26<br />\nNews-Letter.

Lee<br />\nsoon realized he was not in alien<br />\nterritory; he warmed to the<br />\ncrowd, bringing with him and<br />\ngenerating more enthusiasm than<br />\nany other symposium speaker in<br />\nrecent memory, especially last<br />\nThursday's.<br />\nFrom the age of 17 on, Lee<br />\nwrote story lines for comic books<br />\nas well as ad copy and radio<br />\nPlays. He rationalized his<br />\nactivities as \"just making sonic<br />\nmoney while waiting for the big<br />\nbreak.\" After 20 years, he<br />\nrealized he was \"stuck in comic<br />\nbooks\" so he decided to<br />\nsomething different to the<br />\nmedium. Lee's revolutionary<br />\nconcept was to invent a new line<br />\nof superheroes, as excitini; as<br />\nestablished figures such as<br />\nSuperman and Batman but with<br />\nmore human, more complex<br />\npersonalities. The year was 1960.<br />\nThe industry was in the<br />\ndoldrums. Lee and his colleagues<br />\nhad been turning out B.E.M.'s<br />\n(hug-eyed monsters) such as<br />\nM UGU-Pak000m (the third \"o\"<br />\nIS silent), the alien<br />\ncreature who<br />\ndevoured Philadelphia, but<br />\nreaders turned apathetic.<br /><br />\n's a plane, it's Stan Lee!!!<br /><br />\nStan Lee's humanized<br />\nsuper-heroes, the Fantastic Four,<br />\nprobably saved the entire<br />\nindustry from going under. A<br />\nman who is, in his own words,<br />\n\"hooked on reality,\" Lee created<br />\nnaturalistic but witty dialogue<br />\nwhich was unlike the stilted,<br />\nh3ckneyed style of the<br />\ncompetition. Spiderman, finally<br />\nunmasked as the alter ego of Stan<br />\nLee himself, is probably the most<br />\nfamous of the new breed of<br />\nmarvel culture heroes. \"A real<br />\nnebbish, a loser even when he's<br />\nSpiderman; a skinny kid with his<br /><br />\nStan Lee, Marvel Man<br /><br />\nAfter all, he's just an ordinary<br />\nAmerican teen-ager who one day<br />\nhappens to be bitten by a<br />\nradioactive spider. What can be<br />\nmore believable than that<br />\npremise!<br />\nStan Lee's genius created<br />\nweird characters but wrote thair<br />\nadventures intelligently and<br />\n\"realistically.\" Intellectuals<br />\nresponded to his comic books at<br />\nplaces like Berkeley, Chicago,<br />\nand even at the institution Lee<br />\ncontinuously referred to as The<br />\nMark Hopkins University<br />\n(confuses us with a San Francisco<br />\nhotel which once probably<br />\nrefused to rent The Amazing<br />\nHulk a room). Superb artists like<br />\nJack Kirby and Gene Colan,<br />\nrecruited by Lee for the Marvel<br />\nMafia, are also largely responsible<br />\nfor the artistic success of this<br />\nnative American art form.<br />\nToday even educators<br />\nrecognize the importance of<br />\ncomic books in expanding<br />\nvocabularies and encouraging<br />\nyoung people to read. The<br />\nesoteric wisdom. of Dr. Stange,<br />\nMaster of Black Magic, has<br />\nprovided mystics and<br />\nprofessional philosophers with<br />\nvaluable insights into the<br />\nmeaning of our existence. Stan<br />\nLee has conic a long way from<br />\nMUGU-PAKOOM, enhancing his<br />\nstatus as a Superhero with each<br />\nnew venture. Watch out for<br />\nHoward the Duck! May such<br />\nMarvels never cease.<br /><br />\nThe phoenix of 31st Street:Judy's delicatessen opens<br />\nBy J. A. McERLEAN<br />\nThe death of the B &amp; M sub<br />\nshop last February left a gaping<br />\nhole in Charles Village. No longer<br />\ncould I creep over to 31st and<br />\nGuilford for midnight pastrami.<br />\n1\\10 more could anyone pack his<br />\nstomach with a wad of greasy<br />\nfrench fries for forty cents. And<br />\nnever again would Sonny, the<br />\nPeripatetic proprietor, snare<br />\nInnumerable Battaglia-isms.<br />\nFrom dust it came and to dust<br />\nthe \"Beem\" returned, but from<br />\nits ashes rose Judy's, the<br />\nPhoenix, two weeks ago. I had to<br />\nbe skeptical. Any place trying to<br />\nsupplant the old B &amp; M had some<br />\ndirty, smelly shoes to fill. My<br />\ncuriosity led me to the hallowed<br />\ncorner a short while ago and to<br />\nirlY surprise, Sonny's dirty old<br />\nsmelly cellar had metamorphosed<br />\ninto the swan of yore. Clean<br />\nWhite ceiling, clean floor, clean<br />\nShelves. What happened to the B<br />\n&amp; M, whose dirt and muck<br />\ncollection was among Baltimore's<br />\nfinest; I still had to adjust my<br />\nstature to accomodate the<br />\nCurvaceous roof reminiscent of<br />\nsome undulating Iowa hills, and<br /><br />\nstill I bumped my head, as<br />\nalways, but only once.<br />\nMy memory was a bit foggy. I<br />\ncould not recall the exact layout<br />\nof Sonny's B &amp; M. But sure as<br />\nmy breath reeks of onions, the B<br />\n&amp; M's seed had not been dormant<br />\nsince February, but had been<br />\nbusy germinating all summer and<br />\nwas now in fall flower as Judy's .<br />\nTalking with Bill, the \"maitre'd\"<br />\nthere, I found that Judy's was<br />\nnamed after the daughter of the<br />\nnew owner, Charles Lambert, a<br />\nrestauranteur from southwest<br />\nBaltimore. Indeed Bill and<br />\nLambert had been busy all<br />\nsummer refurbishing the old<br />\nBeem. Over a cup of coffee Bill<br />\nrevealed that in many ways<br />\nSonny's spirit resides still, though<br />\nin a more sanitized state.<br />\nHave your choice of three<br />\nkinds of hot dogs\u2014regular,<br />\nkosher, or Polish\u2014for forty to<br />\nsixty cents. Bill restored my faith<br />\nthat for a buck one can still<br />\npartake like a king or a pig or<br />\nboth, in food that, for quality<br />\nand quantity, should shame the<br />\nRathskellar. And it does. Whereas<br />\na dollar spent on Saga fare can<br /><br />\nbarely dent my hunger, the same<br />\nbill at Judy's can keep my<br />\nstomach pangs on the run for<br />\nseveral hours.<br />\nThe refrigerators are still a bit<br />\nbarren, but one must understand<br />\nthat a two-week old<br />\nestablishment cannot be<br />\nexpected to house full bins.<br />\nDeviled eggs are not there yet,<br />\nand I do not miss them, but they<br />\nare a on the way. Lacking is<br />\npastrami, my favorite, but it too<br />\nwill be on the shelves shortly, as<br />\nsoon as Judy's supplier decides to<br /><br />\nstop between Eddie's and<br />\nGreenmount. Judy's seems to<br />\nhave more beer on hand than<br />\nanything else. Is she expecting to<br />\nbe the lone supplier when ATO<br />\nruns out of beer at their next<br />\nparty? Methinks not. The Village<br />\nis full of thirsty folk, and what<br />\nwith a fresh Colts season on<br />\nhand, a hefty arsenal of spiritous<br />\nfermenti is not only desirable,<br />\nbut imperative.(However, do not<br />\nforget the Bawlamer Blue Laws:<br />\nno booze on the Sabbath.)<br />\nUnlike the old Beem, Judy's<br /><br />\nJudy's Confectionary &amp; Carry Out<br /><br />\nhas a modest grocery section.<br />\nThough the prices are a bit higher<br />\nthan our friend Eddie's, you<br />\nmust give this small place credit<br />\nfor the innovation. A<br />\ndollar-eighty may sound stiff for<br />\na gallon of milk, but consider<br />\nthat Lambert will only make<br />\nthirteen cents on each carton.<br />\nAnd try buying milk at Eddie's at<br />\nten p.m.<br />\nI liked everything about<br />\nJudy's. They have even<br />\nconstructed a little grating at the<br />\nbottom of the stairwell entrance<br />\nto keep your feet dry when it<br />\nrains. We who have gone to the B<br />\n&amp; M on such a day and been<br />\ngreeted by a shoeful of water<br />\nthere will surely appreciate the<br />\nthought. My only criticism,<br />\nthough is that Judy's is only<br />\nopen until ten p.m. seven days a<br />\nweek. But this is on a trial basis<br />\nand the hours may be extended if<br />\nsufficient interest arises. We<br />\nwould all do well to invest a buck<br />\nfor a junior sub in support of<br />\nwhat may become another<br />\nVillage establishment. Sonny's<br />\ndirty smelly shoes have been<br />\nfilled, and filled well.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letterioctober 14, 1975<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Press announces its fall publications<br />\nW.

Highlights in the<br />\ndrive which culminated in a 14<br />\nyard touchdown by Golz<br />\nincluded two crucial third down<br />\nconversions by Fischer.<br />\nHopkins' efforts to strike back<br />\nin the first half were time and<br />\nagain precluded by their own<br />\nmistakes. On the first possession<br />\nfollowing the Ursinus<br />\ntouchdown, the Blue Jays drove<br />\ndeep into Bear territory only to<br />\nhave a Dave Emala pass<br />\nintercepted by an Ursinus<br />\nlinebacker.<br />\nIn the closing minutes of the<br />\nfirst quarter, some hard and<br />\ndetermined running by Jerry<br />\nFaraino, John Coad and<br />\nfreshman Mike Jurgenson went<br /><br />\nfor naught as Emala's pass<br />\nintended for Joey Devlin was<br />\nintercepted by defensive back<br />\nMike Gordon. The nightmare did<br />\nnot end here. In their next<br />\npossession, a 17 yard completion<br />\nfrom Emala to Devlin was<br />\nfollowed by a fumble by Pinky<br />\nNorbeck following an excellent<br />\nrun by the senior co-captain.<br />\nThe story then was all the<br />\nHopkins' defense in the first half<br />\nwhich consistently stopped the<br />\nBears' attack.<br />\nThe Jay's came out of the<br />\nlocker room fired up and<br />\nmounted a strong offensive drive<br />\non their first possession in the<br />\nsecond half. Following a 23-yard<br />\nkickoff return by Jurgenson,<br />\nEmala spearheaded a drive to the<br />\nBear 23, calling his own number<br />\non numerous occasions. A<br /><br />\n20-yard keeper to the Ursinus 35<br />\nwas followed by an apparent<br />\ncompletion to Jerry Faraino,<br />\ncalled back however for illegal<br />\nprocedure by the Jays.<br />\nForced to punt, the Jays<br />\ndefense then came up with<br />\nanother spectacular effort as on<br />\nthe first Ursinus play, Fischer<br />\nwas hit hard and fumbled into<br />\nthe hands of linebacker John<br />\nNutting, a four year Hopkins'<br />\nstarter who enjoyed one of his<br />\nfinest afternoons despite coming<br />\noff a painful neck injury.<br />\nAt last, the Hopkins' offense<br />\ntook the cue and drove the ball<br />\n24 yards in nine plays to make<br />\nthe score 7-6. Faraino's one yard<br />\ntouchdown run off the block of<br />\nsenior John Bojarski was then<br />\nfollowed by a gutsy call by<br />\nEmala. Not content with tying<br /><br />\n1101w<br /><br />\n2113u<br /><br />\nthe score with an extra point,<br />\nEmala instead kept the ball and<br />\nswept the left side into paydirt,<br />\nputting Hopkins on top for good,<br />\n8-7.<br />\nUrsinus had six opportunities<br />\nto score the remainder of the<br />\ngame but could not put together<br />\nanything resembling a sustained<br />\nattack as they had by now been<br />\nnoticeably intimated by the<br />\ntenacious Hopkins' defense.<br />\nAll afternoon, Ursinus ran<br />\nrunning play after running play<br />\napparently afraid to test the<br />\nHopkins secondary of Brian<br />\nCoulter, Bill Norbeck, and Mike<br />\nRhodey.
