Goldstein<br />\n<br />\nComedy of Errors<br />\nAlthough on the surface it appears that the IFB is<br />\ndoing a good job this year, if one scratches the epidermis,<br />\na series of mishaps and miscalculations are revealed which<br />\nmore than suggest that Decker and Co. has been sloughing<br />\noff in monstrous proportions.<br />\nWe shall commence at the genesis of this administration. The fall formal, originally scheduled, was rescheduled due to a conflict with a Barnstormer date. This<br />\nmiscalculation cost the IFB the use of the Dixie Ballroom,<br />\nthe band it had originally contracted, and $417.38 of extraneous gymnasium costs, such as tables, chairs, linen,<br />\nservice charges, and damage done to three decorative pine<br />\ntrees.<br />\nThen the Bowman Cup, which was not presented on<br />\ntime to AD, is less than half the size of the original cup,<br />\nretired this year by Phi Ep. The Bowman Certificates<br />\nhave not yet been printed, because they are locked in the<br />\nIFB filing cabinet, and the keys are lost. The keys were<br />\nalso lost to the office of the Vigilance Committee, hence no<br />\nfraternity has sat vigilance duty for months. But it makes<br />\nlittle difference anyway, as the phone has been taken out<br />\nof the office because Decker neither handed over phone bills<br />\nnor money to secretary-treasurer Maseritz.<br />\nIf one recalls the Phi Sig-Phi Ep \"dirty\" rushing incident of the past semester, he will also recall the $100<br />\nfine levied against each fraternity, and the threat that the<br />\ninvolved freshmen would be called before the Board for<br />\na thorough castigation and indocrination into the ways of<br />\ngentlemanly rushing. The freshmen were never called;<br />\nPhi Ep is yet to pay up; no $100, hence no paid phone<br />\nbills, hence no vigilance duty.<br />\nThe committee established before Christmas vacation<br />\nto report upon a new rush system has not only failed to<br />\nreport, but has also failed to meet in full force. At IFB<br />\nmeetings, the recorder, never mimeos the minutes; consequently Maseritz shoulders the responsibility. When<br />\nquestions of constitutionality arise, a constitution is never<br />\navailable.<br />\nThese are just the highlights.. Let's all have a good<br />\nlaugh at the IFB's incompetence, and trust that it better<br />\ndamn sight get on the ball.<br />\n<br />\nThe Facts of Life<br />\nReaction to the announcement that the entering<br />\nFreshmen of September, 1958, will not be allowed to park<br />\ncars on the campus if they reside more than three-quarters<br />\nof a mile from the University, has been mixed. We have<br />\nheard everything from indignant \"I don't like it one damn<br />\nbit,\" to \"I don't have any kick. At other schools I wouldn't<br />\neven be able to have a car until my senior year.\"<br />\nThe facts of life in regard to the University parking<br />\ndilemma are quite simple: there are too many cars for<br />\navailable parking spaces. The answer to the problem isn't<br />\nso simple. The parking commission took the action because it felt that there were no more parking spaces available. Others have disputed this.<br />\nWyman Park has been suggested, but typographical<br />\nstudies of the area indicate that development would be<br />\nvery expensive. It takes a 65 foot strip for two rows of<br />\ncars. Parking garages are extremely expensive. Underground facilities cost well over $2000 per car: Above-theground structures are priced at a minimum of $1300 per<br />\ncar. The garages have not been discarded but they would<br />\nbe a last step, for operation would be both difficult and<br />\ncostly.<br />\nA third possibility is the further development of the<br />\nexisting lot near the faculty club. We have not been given<br />\na satisfactory answer as to why this area can't be expanded.<br />\nSince there are many more registered cars than available spaces, the only way the maximum number of drivers<br />\ncan be accommodated is to have turnover. This new rule<br />\nis aimed at achieving greater turnover, to eliminate the<br />\ncars that are parked for days at a time.<br />\nBut the dormitory residents need help also. We have<br />\npetitioned the parking commission requesting that they try<br />\nto have the two hour parking limit recinded on Charles<br />\nStreet. At the present time the University parking facilities, with the exception of the tiny dormitory, lot, are<br />\nthird choice for dormitory residents. Charles St. and<br />\nUniversity Parkway are first on the list. Thus if the<br />\nparking commission can persuade the City to allow unlimited parking on the adjacent streets, the on-campus<br />\nstorage problem will be greatly reduced.<br />\n<br />\nFilner<br />\n<br />\nAt one end of the panelled Tudor and Stuart Room is a gas-fired fireplace on which the members may heat their tea water.

Following is a list of simple<br />\ninstructions which,if faithfully observed, will positively guarantee that you will be a mad success LIS a sorority girl.<br />\nFirst, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The housemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You must treat<br />\nher with respect. When you wish to speak to her, address her as<br />\n\"Mother Sigafoos\" or \"Ma'am.\" In no circumstances must you<br />\nsay,\"Hey, fat lady.\",<br />\nSecond, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on the<br />\nfront porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and shows<br />\na want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.<br />\nThird, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing<br />\nmeals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your cook<br />\ngoes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied and<br />\nnourishing. The least you can do is show your appreciation.<br />\nDon't just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with delight,<br />\n!What delicious pork jowls!\" or \"What a yummy soupbone l'!<br />\nor \"What scrumptious fish heads!\" or \"What clear water!\"<br />\nFourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance reflects<br />\nnot just on yourself but on the whole house. It was well enough<br />\nbefore you joined a sorority to lounge around campus in your<br />\nold middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now you must take<br />\ngreat pains to dress in a manner which excites admiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago, for example,<br />\nthere was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk at the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her sorors.<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nFrosh-Soph Ball<br />\nSet Next Month<br />\nFor Local Hotel<br />\n<br />\n19-Inch Snowstorm<br />\nWreaks JHU Havoc<br />\n<br />\n(Continued front Page 1)<br />\nThe Frosh-Soph Prom will be commented that \"we were just<br />\nheld on March 1, at the Alcazar lucky\" in reporting that \"for<br />\nsome unknown reason\" he had<br />\nBallroom from 9-1 a.m.<br />\nextra supply of food<br />\nThe original theme of the ordered an<br />\nlast Friday and still managed<br />\ndance, \"Harbour Lights,\" has to obtain fresh bread, meat and<br />\nbeen modified because of the milk on Monday and Tuesday.<br />\nsize and present decoration of \"My staff had to carry it in<br />\nthe Alcazar, according to dance from the truck on Charles<br />\nchairman Dick McCarty.

It sounded like real opportunity. After<br />\nan interview with an IBM branch manager, Gene<br />\nMcGrew was sure. Although sales was only one of many<br />\njobs he felt he could handle, this kind of selling (IBM<br />\nmachines are as much an idea as a product) would enable<br />\nhim to capitalize fully on his education,experience,and<br />\ntalents. He's learned also that \"no other form of training or career development I can think of provides such<br />\ndiversity of experience in all phases of business and<br />\nindustrial activity. This kind of training and experience<br />\ndevelops top business executives.\"<br />\nThus began an extensive and interesting training program marked by merit salary increases. The first three<br />\nmonths of the training course combined<br />\nintroductory machine<br />\nschooling and observation of branch office<br />\noperations in Pittsburgh (his home<br />\ntown). The next three<br />\nmonths were spent<br />\nstudying the application of the Company's<br />\ndata processing machines to major phases<br />\nof accounting in busiOutlining programming test<br />\nness, science and<br />\ngovernment. With this background of know-how, Gene<br />\nMcGrew was ready for seven months of practical field<br />\ntraining, during which he became a real contributing<br />\nmember of the sales team, working with a succession of<br />\nexperienced salesmen in a variety of situations with<br />\nmany different customers. With this experience behind<br />\nhim, he was ready for IBM's famous sales school, a<br />\nfinal five-week polishing course in selling techniques.<br />\nReceives<br />\n<br />\ntend its use to new applications. He is also responsible<br />\nfor the development of new business. His biggest sale<br />\nwas to a large industrial<br />\ncorporation. Now installed, this IBM electronic system simplifies<br />\n.various major phases<br />\nof the customer's accounting work. His fine<br />\njob with this customer<br />\nresulted in the expanded use of equipment and the ordering<br />\nDiscussing customer's installation<br />\nof three additional<br />\nmedium-sized data processing machines. He is now<br />\nworking to develop the sale of one of IBM's largest<br />\ncomputers, the 705, to another customer.<br />\n<br />\nFuture wide open<br />\n\"Advancement opportunities in IBM,\" Gene McGrew<br />\nsays,\"are excellent, as you'd expect in the leading company in a dynamic and<br />\nrapidly expanding industry. Ahead of me on<br />\nthe sales management<br />\nadvancement road are<br />\nnearly two hundred<br />\nBranch Managerships,<br />\nseventeen District<br />\nManagerships, and numerous executive positions at the Regional<br />\nand Headquarters<br />\nlevel in five different<br />\nChecking out new client's system<br />\ndivisions.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThis profile is just one example of what it's like to be<br />\nwith IBM.

Goldstein<br /><br />\nComedy of Errors<br />\nAlthough on the surface it appears that the IFB is<br />\ndoing a good job this year, if one scratches the epidermis,<br />\na series of mishaps and miscalculations are revealed which<br />\nmore than suggest that Decker and Co. has been sloughing<br />\noff in monstrous proportions.<br />\nWe shall commence at the genesis of this administration. The fall formal, originally scheduled, was rescheduled due to a conflict with a Barnstormer date. This<br />\nmiscalculation cost the IFB the use of the Dixie Ballroom,<br />\nthe band it had originally contracted, and $417.38 of extraneous gymnasium costs, such as tables, chairs, linen,<br />\nservice charges, and damage done to three decorative pine<br />\ntrees.<br />\nThen the Bowman Cup, which was not presented on<br />\ntime to AD, is less than half the size of the original cup,<br />\nretired this year by Phi Ep. The Bowman Certificates<br />\nhave not yet been printed, because they are locked in the<br />\nIFB filing cabinet, and the keys are lost. The keys were<br />\nalso lost to the office of the Vigilance Committee, hence no<br />\nfraternity has sat vigilance duty for months. But it makes<br />\nlittle difference anyway, as the phone has been taken out<br />\nof the office because Decker neither handed over phone bills<br />\nnor money to secretary-treasurer Maseritz.<br />\nIf one recalls the Phi Sig-Phi Ep \"dirty\" rushing incident of the past semester, he will also recall the $100<br />\nfine levied against each fraternity, and the threat that the<br />\ninvolved freshmen would be called before the Board for<br />\na thorough castigation and indocrination into the ways of<br />\ngentlemanly rushing. The freshmen were never called;<br />\nPhi Ep is yet to pay up; no $100, hence no paid phone<br />\nbills, hence no vigilance duty.<br />\nThe committee established before Christmas vacation<br />\nto report upon a new rush system has not only failed to<br />\nreport, but has also failed to meet in full force. At IFB<br />\nmeetings, the recorder, never mimeos the minutes; consequently Maseritz shoulders the responsibility. When<br />\nquestions of constitutionality arise, a constitution is never<br />\navailable.<br />\nThese are just the highlights.. Let's all have a good<br />\nlaugh at the IFB's incompetence, and trust that it better<br />\ndamn sight get on the ball.<br /><br />\nThe Facts of Life<br />\nReaction to the announcement that the entering<br />\nFreshmen of September, 1958, will not be allowed to park<br />\ncars on the campus if they reside more than three-quarters<br />\nof a mile from the University, has been mixed. We have<br />\nheard everything from indignant \"I don't like it one damn<br />\nbit,\" to \"I don't have any kick. At other schools I wouldn't<br />\neven be able to have a car until my senior year.\"<br />\nThe facts of life in regard to the University parking<br />\ndilemma are quite simple: there are too many cars for<br />\navailable parking spaces. The answer to the problem isn't<br />\nso simple. The parking commission took the action because it felt that there were no more parking spaces available. Others have disputed this.<br />\nWyman Park has been suggested, but typographical<br />\nstudies of the area indicate that development would be<br />\nvery expensive. It takes a 65 foot strip for two rows of<br />\ncars. Parking garages are extremely expensive. Underground facilities cost well over $2000 per car: Above-theground structures are priced at a minimum of $1300 per<br />\ncar. The garages have not been discarded but they would<br />\nbe a last step, for operation would be both difficult and<br />\ncostly.<br />\nA third possibility is the further development of the<br />\nexisting lot near the faculty club. We have not been given<br />\na satisfactory answer as to why this area can't be expanded.<br />\nSince there are many more registered cars than available spaces, the only way the maximum number of drivers<br />\ncan be accommodated is to have turnover. This new rule<br />\nis aimed at achieving greater turnover, to eliminate the<br />\ncars that are parked for days at a time.<br />\nBut the dormitory residents need help also. We have<br />\npetitioned the parking commission requesting that they try<br />\nto have the two hour parking limit recinded on Charles<br />\nStreet. At the present time the University parking facilities, with the exception of the tiny dormitory, lot, are<br />\nthird choice for dormitory residents. Charles St. and<br />\nUniversity Parkway are first on the list. Thus if the<br />\nparking commission can persuade the City to allow unlimited parking on the adjacent streets, the on-campus<br />\nstorage problem will be greatly reduced.<br /><br />\nFilner<br /><br />\nAt one end of the panelled Tudor and Stuart Room is a gas-fired fireplace on which the members may heat their tea water.

The latter was a<br />\nstudent here, but was killed in<br />\nWorld War I.<br />\nMembership in the Club is<br />\nhonorary, and consists of graduate and undergraduate students<br />\nand faculty members of both the<br />\nHomewood and the Medical<br />\nSchools who are interested. An<br />\ninterest in English literature,<br />\nparticularly that of the Tudor<br />\nand Stuart eras, is the main<br />\nqualification for election.<br /><br />\nClub also has on display the fishing equipment of William Revere<br />\nOsier.<br />\nUse of the library Is restricted<br />\nto members. Non-members, doing<br />\nresearch for theses and papers,<br />\nmay use the Club's library with<br />\npermission from Curator Louis<br />\nKeuthe.<br />\nBusiness matters of the Club<br />\nare conducted by an Executive<br />\nBoard, consisting of members of<br />\nthe faculty and graduate and<br />\nundergraduate student bodies of<br />\nHomewood and the Medical<br />\nSchool. Currently in office are:<br />\nPresident, Richard<br />\nShryock,<br />\nProfessor History at the Medical<br />\nSchool; Vice-President, Albert<br />\nHammond, Associate Professor<br />\nof Philosophy; permanent Curator, Louis Kuethe, Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Assistant Librarian;<br />\nand Executive Secretary, William Casey, a senior majoring in<br />\nbiological sciences. Serving as<br />\nrepresentatives of the student<br />\nbody are Eugene Sekulow, Graduate Representative, and Rud<br />\nTurnbull, Undergraduate Representative. Both Sekulow and<br />\nTurnbull are majornig in political science.<br /><br />\nmember of the Club who is connected wtih the same branch of<br />\nthe University. This year's elections will be held this spring. An<br />\naverage of ten men are elected<br />\nfrom each class in the undergraduate school, Turnbull estimated.<br />\nA brochure, listing former and<br />\npresent officers of the Club as<br />\nwell as current members, is now<br />\nbeing prepared for publishing by<br />\nRichard Lidz, a Club member<br />\nwho is a former Editor of the<br />\nNews-Letter and who has also<br />\nserved as a Club officer. The<br />\npamphlet will be ready for distribution shortly.<br />\nTwo Distinct Features<br />\n\"It is probably a safe assumption that the Tudor and Stuart<br />\nClub graduates more Phi Beta<br />\nKappa students per year than<br />\nany other organization at the<br />\nUniversity. In spite of this, however, the only academic requirement for membership is that the<br />\nnominee stand in the top third<br />\nof his class,\" Turnbull said.<br />\nThe Club supplies tobacco,<br />\nkept in metal humidors on<br />\nthe marble mantle above the<br />\nfireplace (see picture), pretzels<br />\nand tea for members' use. \"This<br />\nmight seem to be a superfluous<br />\ntouch, but it is an appreciated<br />\nluxury of membership,\" Turnbull<br />\nsaid.<br /><br />\nMonthly Lectures Given<br />\nMembers of the Club meet<br />\nmonthly to hear a guest or UniElected For Life<br />\nversity faculty member on a<br />\nMembers of the Tudor and<br />\ntopic concerning English literature, usually the life, philosophy Stuart Club are elected for life<br />\nand writings of a particular au- by the Executive Board after<br />\nthor.

According to Rud Turnbull, the undergraduate representative of the club, Sir William<br />\n\"farsightedly stipulated in his<br />\nendowment, the revenue of<br />\nwhich we still enjoy, that the<br />\nclub serve beer after each lecture. It is the pleasure of the<br />\nmembers to wilfully submit.\"<br />\nIn addiiton to its collection of<br />\nSpenser, the Club's library also<br />\nhas a number of first copies of<br />\nShakespeare's works and of Walt<br />\nWhitman's \"Leaves of Grass\".<br />\nWhile a number of its books are<br />\nof such great value that they<br />\nmust be kept in the Club's locked<br />\nsafe, the majority of them are<br />\ndisplayed in glass-covered bookshelves.<br />\nSir William's son was an<br />\nardent fisherman, and lover of<br />\nthe books of the great English<br />\nangler, Sir Lsaac Walton; hence<br />\nthe club has collected many un1 //;/<br />\n,'<br />\nusual and rare volumes of his ','\u2022<br />\n,,,<br />\n/<br />\n\u2022,<br />\nworks both from the library of<br />\n\u2022<br />\n/. /,<br />\n.\u2022/<br />\n/\u2022<br />\n/,<br />\n1/<br />\n//<br />\nA,/7/A/,<br />\nits founder and from outside<br />\nsources.<br /><br />\nFishing Equipment<br />\n\"Hey Joe, help me roll up my European deflatable car.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn addition to these books, the gave you the ride.\"<br /><br />\nr\\tt<br />\nI<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, FEB. 21, 1958<br /><br />\nOn Noirela*.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n(By the Author of \"Rally Round the Flag, Boys!\" and<br />\n\"Barefoot Boy with Cheek.\")<br /><br />\nTHE PLEDGE YOU SAVE<br />\nMAY BE YOUR OWN<br />\nToday's column is directed at those young female undergraduates who have recently pledged sororities and are worried, poor<br />\nlambs, that they won't make good. Following is a list of simple<br />\ninstructions which,if faithfully observed, will positively guarantee that you will be a mad success LIS a sorority girl.<br />\nFirst, let us take up the matter of housemothers. The housemother is your friend, your guide, your mentor. You must treat<br />\nher with respect. When you wish to speak to her, address her as<br />\n\"Mother Sigafoos\" or \"Ma'am.\" In no circumstances must you<br />\nsay,\"Hey, fat lady.\",<br />\nSecond, let us discuss laundry. Never hang your wash on the<br />\nfront porch of the sorority house. This is unsightly and shows<br />\na want of breeding. Use the Chapter Room.<br />\nThird, meals. Always remember that planning and preparing<br />\nmeals for a houseful of healthy girls is no simple task. Your cook<br />\ngoes to a great deal of trouble to make your menu varied and<br />\nnourishing. The least you can do is show your appreciation.<br />\nDon't just devour your food; praise it. Exclaim with delight,<br />\n!What delicious pork jowls!\" or \"What a yummy soupbone l'!<br />\nor \"What scrumptious fish heads!\" or \"What clear water!\"<br />\nFourth, clothing. Never forget that your appearance reflects<br />\nnot just on yourself but on the whole house. It was well enough<br />\nbefore you joined a sorority to lounge around campus in your<br />\nold middy blouse and gym bloomers, but now you must take<br />\ngreat pains to dress in a manner which excites admiring comments from all who observe you. A few years ago, for example,<br />\nthere was a Chi Omega named Camille Ataturk at the University of Iowa who brought gobs of glory to all her sorors.<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br /><br />\nFrosh-Soph Ball<br />\nSet Next Month<br />\nFor Local Hotel<br /><br />\n19-Inch Snowstorm<br />\nWreaks JHU Havoc<br /><br />\n(Continued front Page 1)<br />\nThe Frosh-Soph Prom will be commented that \"we were just<br />\nheld on March 1, at the Alcazar lucky\" in reporting that \"for<br />\nsome unknown reason\" he had<br />\nBallroom from 9-1 a.m.<br />\nextra supply of food<br />\nThe original theme of the ordered an<br />\nlast Friday and still managed<br />\ndance, \"Harbour Lights,\" has to obtain fresh bread, meat and<br />\nbeen modified because of the milk on Monday and Tuesday.<br />\nsize and present decoration of \"My staff had to carry it in<br />\nthe Alcazar, according to dance from the truck on Charles<br />\nchairman Dick McCarty.

It sounded like real opportunity. After<br />\nan interview with an IBM branch manager, Gene<br />\nMcGrew was sure. Although sales was only one of many<br />\njobs he felt he could handle, this kind of selling (IBM<br />\nmachines are as much an idea as a product) would enable<br />\nhim to capitalize fully on his education,experience,and<br />\ntalents. He's learned also that \"no other form of training or career development I can think of provides such<br />\ndiversity of experience in all phases of business and<br />\nindustrial activity. This kind of training and experience<br />\ndevelops top business executives.\"<br />\nThus began an extensive and interesting training program marked by merit salary increases. The first three<br />\nmonths of the training course combined<br />\nintroductory machine<br />\nschooling and observation of branch office<br />\noperations in Pittsburgh (his home<br />\ntown). The next three<br />\nmonths were spent<br />\nstudying the application of the Company's<br />\ndata processing machines to major phases<br />\nof accounting in busiOutlining programming test<br />\nness, science and<br />\ngovernment. With this background of know-how, Gene<br />\nMcGrew was ready for seven months of practical field<br />\ntraining, during which he became a real contributing<br />\nmember of the sales team, working with a succession of<br />\nexperienced salesmen in a variety of situations with<br />\nmany different customers. With this experience behind<br />\nhim, he was ready for IBM's famous sales school, a<br />\nfinal five-week polishing course in selling techniques.<br />\nReceives<br /><br />\ntend its use to new applications. He is also responsible<br />\nfor the development of new business. His biggest sale<br />\nwas to a large industrial<br />\ncorporation. Now installed, this IBM electronic system simplifies<br />\n.various major phases<br />\nof the customer's accounting work. His fine<br />\njob with this customer<br />\nresulted in the expanded use of equipment and the ordering<br />\nDiscussing customer's installation<br />\nof three additional<br />\nmedium-sized data processing machines. He is now<br />\nworking to develop the sale of one of IBM's largest<br />\ncomputers, the 705, to another customer.<br /><br />\nFuture wide open<br />\n\"Advancement opportunities in IBM,\" Gene McGrew<br />\nsays,\"are excellent, as you'd expect in the leading company in a dynamic and<br />\nrapidly expanding industry. Ahead of me on<br />\nthe sales management<br />\nadvancement road are<br />\nnearly two hundred<br />\nBranch Managerships,<br />\nseventeen District<br />\nManagerships, and numerous executive positions at the Regional<br />\nand Headquarters<br />\nlevel in five different<br />\nChecking out new client's system<br />\ndivisions.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\n\u2022<br />\nThis profile is just one example of what it's like to be<br />\nwith IBM.
