Recollection of the Queen's Jubilee crush had not<br />\nentirely faded, and when a resourceful Bloomsbury landlady wired, \"sorry, but<br />\nno room,\" there was a cheerful reversal of plans, a season of recovery in Liverpool, and ultimate refuge in Ambleside, in the Lake Country.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nIf the placid beauty of the English Lake District fails to key one quite up<br />\nto guide-book phrase, certainly it has a gentle charm and a restful loveliness<br />\nthat wins and holds. Literary association and natural environment are in a<br />\nrare unison that brings quiet and peace. One lazes and dreams, and the world<br />\nand all its unrest seem away forever.<br />\n. I doubt if any but Anglo-Saxon stuff could have reacted so well from the<br />\ndisappointment and loss of the King's illness, and the abandoned coronation<br />\nceremonies. Nothing had been spared to present a great spectacular display.<br />\nEven the staid old lady of Threadneedle Street had put her hand deep in the<br />\ncorporate purse and expended several thousand pounds in arranging for illumination. When the bolt struck there was a moment of daze, and then John Bull<br />\nPulled himself resolutely together. Householders took in their bunting; procession-stand owners refunded their receipts; hotels and restaurants returned to<br />\nnormal tariffs, and The Times discontinued its leaders on the harmony of divine<br />\nkingship ceremonies with the ideals of parliamentary government. There was<br />\ndamage, of course\u2014and sometimes worse\u2014but it was faced bravely and accepted<br />\ndefinitely.<br />\nIt would be difficult to find better illustrations of the essential qualities of<br />\nthe English character than those growing out of the three great events of the<br />\nmid-July weeks\u2014the postponement of the King's coronation, the resignation of<br />\nLord Salisbury, and the conclusion of the Boer War and Lord Kitchener's<br />\nreturn to London. Even to the transient sojourner, intent on other things, they<br />\ntold of a people whose very bone and marrow are indomitable will and sturdy<br />\nresourcefulness.<br />\nBut let the political caldron seethe and bubble as it might, the scholarship<br />\nof the world, all summer long, paid its uninterrupted tribute to England in the<br />\nBritish Museum and in the Public Record Office. To be able to secure at call<br />\nevery book that you need is comfort; but to command it in a sense almost proprietary, to be made to feel\u2014not merely to know\u2014that the abundant resources<br />\nof great institutions exist for your aid and convenience\u2014this is the luxury of<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nstudy, suggesting the dictum of our own dear sage that the happiness of life<br />\nconsists in being paid for doing what you want to do.<br />\nJ. H. H., '91.<br />\n<br />\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE PRINCETON INAUGURATION.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE proverb tells us that \"familiarity breeds contempt,\" and sometimes it<br />\nis true. For extemple, I am afraid there is a tendency among many of<br />\nthe humble members of our great institution to imagine sometimes that<br />\nthe western limit of the work of the Johns Hopkins hardly reaches Eutaw<br />\nStreet, rather than the Golden Gate. But that Hopkins man who has lived<br />\nthrough the year 1902 and is still within the bonds of such ignorance must be<br />\na sluggard indeed. For the most renowned and brilliant scholars and educators<br />\nof our America would not have so clearly and unanimously, so enthusiastically<br />\nborne witness to the great power for enlightenment and truth which, starting<br />\nfrom this place, has gone forth to transform the whole life of the country, unless<br />\nthey had meant what they said. To every Hopkins man, no matter how humble, February 22, 1902, was a memorable day.<br />\nBut, as recently I watched the ceremonies attending the inauguration of<br />\nanother president over another institution, it seemed to me that there too I<br />\nhad a vision of a greater Hopkins than I had ever seen before. It is not merely<br />\nthat President Wilson chose this University as the place among all others<br />\nwhich would best fit him for his great work,\u2014it is the fact that he is a Hopkins man, not in mere outward semblace, but in the spirit. Yet this must not<br />\nbe taken to mean that he is not also, and in a very deep sense, a Princeton man.<br />\nPresident Wilson knows and loves almost above everything else the Princeton<br />\nwhich has been handed down to him\u2014a heritage which no wealth could have<br />\nbought, which no scholarship could have won, except after the life-long<br />\ndevotion of many men strong in wisdom and in the knowledge of the Lord.<br />\nWe may be sure that not a stone of this glorious building is to be cast down.<br />\nYet, in his inauguration address, President Wilson distinctly says that he is<br />\ngoing to build something new upon this strong foundation. \"We mean,\" he<br />\nsays,\"<br />\nto build a notable graduate college.\" And when we<br />\nhear him proceed to outline this plan, we see that it bears a striking resemblance to something that we have seen before, and have learned to admire with<br />\nall due humility. Not that it is a copy of anything else under the sun. President Wilson has very different materials to work with from those of any other<br />\nman, and he has a different, an original mind to mould them. But may we<br />\nnot claim that the source of this new impulse which is to become operative in<br />\none of the most conservative institutions in the country, is to be found in that<br />\ngreat idea which was first put into operation in Baltimore? To claim anything<br />\nless, would be to affirm that President Wilson, so closely connected with Johns<br />\nHopkins, has been less affected by it than many thousands of comparative<br />\nstrangers. Of course, this is to be taken for what it is worth, as the feeling of<br />\none who knows very little of that for which this great University has stood,<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nbut it may still be an encouragement for study and for life of more value than<br />\nthe exhortations of the greatest orator that ever lived. As we see the influence<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins spreading out into every field of activity\u2014indeed, building upon the firm and tried foundation of a great college with far greater success than upon the more plastic but less secure ground of intellectual chaos to<br />\nbe found in some less conservative institutions\u2014even the humblest of us must<br />\nfeel some little desire not to be entirely unworthy of that great University<br />\nwhich we have the right not only to admire but also to love.<br />\n3.G.

Western Maryland has put up a wonderfully strong game<br />\nthis season, defeating our old rival, the University of Maryland, sixteen to<br />\nnothing. Our light players, with but three weeks of practice behind them, will<br />\nhave their work cut out and ready for them when they line up at Westminster.<br />\nAnd in recognition of the sporting spirit in which they accept such an unequal<br />\ncontest, they deserve the immediate and practical support of the entire undergraduate student body. Three years ago a green Hopkins team went up to<br />\nWestminster and defeated Western Maryland in a hard fought battle. In<br />\nspeaking of the game afterwards several of the Hopkins men were heard<br />\nto say that it made all the difference in the world to them to hear the J. H. U.<br />\nsongs and yells which were given with such spirit by the 60 rooters who accompanied the team. Much more will this be the case tomorrow, when our practically untried eleven meets a powerful team. Every man in the four undergraduate classes who can possibly take the time off should add his name to the list<br />\non the bulletin-board of those who are to accompany the team. The train leaves<br />\nUnion Station at 10.17 a. m., and it is expected that there will be a special car<br />\nfor the team and rooters. Every man who turns up tomorrow with a flag and<br />\na megaphone and, above all, a voice in good working order, is helping our team<br />\nto get the dash and spirit that they will need to win. All aboard!<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHERE is one method of assisting the Musical Clubs in their work,\u2014a<br />\nmethod, too, which would produce practical and immediate results,\u2014<br />\nwhich is little practiced at the University. This is, the suggestion to<br />\nthe leaders of the various clubs of selections suitable for performance. \"It is<br />\nVery<br />\nthe leader's business to hunt up good pieces himself,\" someone says.<br />\ntrue; but it is also the leader's business to do a hundred other things with<br />\nwhich he cannot be helped by outsiders, and it will materially aid him in getting through his work to have ready at hand a large list of selections from<br />\nwhich to choose in making up a program. Of course, each leader attempts to<br />\nkeep up with the music of the day, and is constantly on the watch for \"something that will go,\" But it is impossible for any one man to keep track of the<br />\nmass of new songs, marches and waltzes that are produced every season. He<br />\ncan attend all the comic operas,\u2014and to some this may seem a not unpleasant<br />\ntask,\u2014be can keep his ears on the alert for a promising ditty whistled on the<br />\nstreet, and he can even, if he is a nervy man, write music himself. But he cannot fail to miss every season a certain number of new and old selections which<br />\nhe would have been glad to consider, and possibly to adopt. The moral of all<br />\nthis is, that every tuneful soul in the college has a chance to help the clubs by<br />\nsending in the names of pieces that he thinks will suit.<br />\nFor the Glee Club, \"close harmony\" and melodies of a kind to bring out<br />\nthe contrasts in the different voices are desired; for the Banjo Club, snappy<br />\nmarches and dances which set the foot involuntarily marking time; for the<br />\nMandolin Club, bright airs and dreamy waltzes. Some who read this may take<br />\nthe hint, and put the leaders on the track of some good music.<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nN another page appear some notes on Dr. Woodrow Wilson's inauguration<br />\nas President of Princeton University. President Wilson has been connected with many institutions of learning in this country\u2014Princeton,<br />\nWake Forest, Tulane, Vale, Bryn Mawr, Wesleyan, New York Law School.<br />\nFrom several of these he has received degrees. But we are proud to note, from<br />\nhis own words and declared policy, that his work at the Johns Hopkins, leading<br />\nto his Ph.D. in 1886, has ever been an especial source of inspiration and benefit<br />\nto him. He is in the first rank of our distinguished graduates, and our pride in<br />\nhim is mingled with congratulations on the early recognition of his worth.<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nGAIN comes the pleasant task of chronicling gifts to the University. The<br />\ndonation from Dr. Christian A.

There<br />\nwas at first some difficulty in getting the piano past the narrow banisters; but<br />\nthis was overcome by the combined ingenuity and strength of a few leading<br />\nspirits, and music held its pleasant sway. Altogether, it was felt that the<br />\nsmoker was to be the forerunner of many more such enjoyable occasions.<br />\n<br />\nTHE MUSICAL CLUBS<br />\n<br />\nThe present candidates for the various clubs are as follows :<br />\nGLEE CLUB: First tenors, Cowles, Carver, Humrichouse, Coffin, Ingraham; second tenors, Hall, Wright, Nelson, Geiger and Longnecker; first<br />\nbasses, Ford, Bryan, R.

The Banjo Club<br />\nhas three new pieces in preparation, and more will follow. Two of the banjeaurine parts this year will be played on an instrument known as the \"banjobanjeaurine,\" which differs from the banjo only in having a shorter neck, and<br />\nwhich has a much sweeter tone than the banjeaurine, the head of which is much<br />\nlarger.<br />\nThe first of the four practice concerts will be as follows:<br />\nFriday afternoon, November 21, at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.<br />\nFriday night, November 28, at St. Mary's Church, Roland Park.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nFOOTBALL SCHEDULE.<br />\nNov. 8\u2014Western Maryland College, at Westminster.<br />\nif 4<br />\n15\u2014(Date cancelled by Gallaudet, now open.)<br />\n22\u2014Maryland Agricultural College, at American League Park.<br />\n27\u2014(Thanksgiving) University of Maryland, at American League<br />\nPark.<br />\nFOOTBALL.<br />\nAPTAIN BLANCK and the players who stick out the present football<br />\nseason deserve all kinds of laurels, for they have certainly been \"up<br />\nagainst it.\"<br />\nThe game with Loyola College at Clifton Park last Saturday was the latest<br />\ndiscouraging incident. A number of new and promising men had been gotten<br />\nout for several days before the game, and prospects were much brighter. One<br />\nor two slight injuries on the last practice day made it necessary to keep several<br />\nof the best men out, but notwithstanding this, it looked as if we were scheduled<br />\nfor victory over a team like Loyola. The results show that other troubles were<br />\non hand. The teams lined up before a crowd which could not be held within<br />\nbounds, and any long run around the end had to be zig-zagged through spectators scattered all over the field. Loyola kicked off, and Hopkins brought the<br />\nball back to the 45 yard line. Hitting the tackles proved effective and the ball<br />\nmoved along until fumble No. 1 gave Loyola the ball. The collegians fussed<br />\naround the ends for several downs and then lost the ball. It was Hopkins<br />\nsecond chance to \"get busy\" and they did it in great style,\u2014so great, in fact,<br />\nthat when fumble No. 2 occurred, a Loyola man took the ball on the jump and<br />\ndodged in and out among the crowd until he- reached the goal line. In this<br />\npoint the only park policeman became the most important factor in the game.<br />\nThe ball had been in play just eight minutes, but it was 4 o'clock, and a permit giving the grounds to the Indians and the Never Sweats from four to six<br />\ncame to view. And that was the finish. Hopkins left the field disgusted.<br />\nSuch happenings are unusually discouraging under the present circumstances, but we are bound to stick it out, and there will be a turn in the tide<br />\nbefore the season ends.<br />\n<br />\nC<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nOur boys are struggling against powerful odds this year, and it is up to<br />\nevery one of us to help out.

Several new men from the Medical School are among the<br />\nnumber, and the Freshman class has contributed several more, among them<br />\nBond, Hull, Chism and Jackson.<br />\nPorter and several more from '04 are hard at work.<br />\nTootle, Pessagno, Blanck, Nelson and Smith will be out from the Senior<br />\nclass, and with several graduates a strong team should be developed.<br />\n<br />\nAROUND THE CAGE.<br />\nHarry Chism, '05, has been elected manager of the Freshman track team<br />\nThe cancellation of our game with Gallaudet on the 15th is the result of a<br />\ndecree from the Gallaudet faculty prohibiting their team to play any games this<br />\nseason.

Recollection of the Queen's Jubilee crush had not<br />\nentirely faded, and when a resourceful Bloomsbury landlady wired, \"sorry, but<br />\nno room,\" there was a cheerful reversal of plans, a season of recovery in Liverpool, and ultimate refuge in Ambleside, in the Lake Country.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nIf the placid beauty of the English Lake District fails to key one quite up<br />\nto guide-book phrase, certainly it has a gentle charm and a restful loveliness<br />\nthat wins and holds. Literary association and natural environment are in a<br />\nrare unison that brings quiet and peace. One lazes and dreams, and the world<br />\nand all its unrest seem away forever.<br />\n. I doubt if any but Anglo-Saxon stuff could have reacted so well from the<br />\ndisappointment and loss of the King's illness, and the abandoned coronation<br />\nceremonies. Nothing had been spared to present a great spectacular display.<br />\nEven the staid old lady of Threadneedle Street had put her hand deep in the<br />\ncorporate purse and expended several thousand pounds in arranging for illumination. When the bolt struck there was a moment of daze, and then John Bull<br />\nPulled himself resolutely together. Householders took in their bunting; procession-stand owners refunded their receipts; hotels and restaurants returned to<br />\nnormal tariffs, and The Times discontinued its leaders on the harmony of divine<br />\nkingship ceremonies with the ideals of parliamentary government. There was<br />\ndamage, of course\u2014and sometimes worse\u2014but it was faced bravely and accepted<br />\ndefinitely.<br />\nIt would be difficult to find better illustrations of the essential qualities of<br />\nthe English character than those growing out of the three great events of the<br />\nmid-July weeks\u2014the postponement of the King's coronation, the resignation of<br />\nLord Salisbury, and the conclusion of the Boer War and Lord Kitchener's<br />\nreturn to London. Even to the transient sojourner, intent on other things, they<br />\ntold of a people whose very bone and marrow are indomitable will and sturdy<br />\nresourcefulness.<br />\nBut let the political caldron seethe and bubble as it might, the scholarship<br />\nof the world, all summer long, paid its uninterrupted tribute to England in the<br />\nBritish Museum and in the Public Record Office. To be able to secure at call<br />\nevery book that you need is comfort; but to command it in a sense almost proprietary, to be made to feel\u2014not merely to know\u2014that the abundant resources<br />\nof great institutions exist for your aid and convenience\u2014this is the luxury of<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nstudy, suggesting the dictum of our own dear sage that the happiness of life<br />\nconsists in being paid for doing what you want to do.<br />\nJ. H. H., '91.<br /><br />\nIMPRESSIONS OF THE PRINCETON INAUGURATION.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE proverb tells us that \"familiarity breeds contempt,\" and sometimes it<br />\nis true. For extemple, I am afraid there is a tendency among many of<br />\nthe humble members of our great institution to imagine sometimes that<br />\nthe western limit of the work of the Johns Hopkins hardly reaches Eutaw<br />\nStreet, rather than the Golden Gate. But that Hopkins man who has lived<br />\nthrough the year 1902 and is still within the bonds of such ignorance must be<br />\na sluggard indeed. For the most renowned and brilliant scholars and educators<br />\nof our America would not have so clearly and unanimously, so enthusiastically<br />\nborne witness to the great power for enlightenment and truth which, starting<br />\nfrom this place, has gone forth to transform the whole life of the country, unless<br />\nthey had meant what they said. To every Hopkins man, no matter how humble, February 22, 1902, was a memorable day.<br />\nBut, as recently I watched the ceremonies attending the inauguration of<br />\nanother president over another institution, it seemed to me that there too I<br />\nhad a vision of a greater Hopkins than I had ever seen before. It is not merely<br />\nthat President Wilson chose this University as the place among all others<br />\nwhich would best fit him for his great work,\u2014it is the fact that he is a Hopkins man, not in mere outward semblace, but in the spirit. Yet this must not<br />\nbe taken to mean that he is not also, and in a very deep sense, a Princeton man.<br />\nPresident Wilson knows and loves almost above everything else the Princeton<br />\nwhich has been handed down to him\u2014a heritage which no wealth could have<br />\nbought, which no scholarship could have won, except after the life-long<br />\ndevotion of many men strong in wisdom and in the knowledge of the Lord.<br />\nWe may be sure that not a stone of this glorious building is to be cast down.<br />\nYet, in his inauguration address, President Wilson distinctly says that he is<br />\ngoing to build something new upon this strong foundation. \"We mean,\" he<br />\nsays,\"<br />\nto build a notable graduate college.\" And when we<br />\nhear him proceed to outline this plan, we see that it bears a striking resemblance to something that we have seen before, and have learned to admire with<br />\nall due humility. Not that it is a copy of anything else under the sun. President Wilson has very different materials to work with from those of any other<br />\nman, and he has a different, an original mind to mould them. But may we<br />\nnot claim that the source of this new impulse which is to become operative in<br />\none of the most conservative institutions in the country, is to be found in that<br />\ngreat idea which was first put into operation in Baltimore? To claim anything<br />\nless, would be to affirm that President Wilson, so closely connected with Johns<br />\nHopkins, has been less affected by it than many thousands of comparative<br />\nstrangers. Of course, this is to be taken for what it is worth, as the feeling of<br />\none who knows very little of that for which this great University has stood,<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nbut it may still be an encouragement for study and for life of more value than<br />\nthe exhortations of the greatest orator that ever lived. As we see the influence<br />\nof the Johns Hopkins spreading out into every field of activity\u2014indeed, building upon the firm and tried foundation of a great college with far greater success than upon the more plastic but less secure ground of intellectual chaos to<br />\nbe found in some less conservative institutions\u2014even the humblest of us must<br />\nfeel some little desire not to be entirely unworthy of that great University<br />\nwhich we have the right not only to admire but also to love.<br />\n3.G.

Western Maryland has put up a wonderfully strong game<br />\nthis season, defeating our old rival, the University of Maryland, sixteen to<br />\nnothing. Our light players, with but three weeks of practice behind them, will<br />\nhave their work cut out and ready for them when they line up at Westminster.<br />\nAnd in recognition of the sporting spirit in which they accept such an unequal<br />\ncontest, they deserve the immediate and practical support of the entire undergraduate student body. Three years ago a green Hopkins team went up to<br />\nWestminster and defeated Western Maryland in a hard fought battle. In<br />\nspeaking of the game afterwards several of the Hopkins men were heard<br />\nto say that it made all the difference in the world to them to hear the J. H. U.<br />\nsongs and yells which were given with such spirit by the 60 rooters who accompanied the team. Much more will this be the case tomorrow, when our practically untried eleven meets a powerful team. Every man in the four undergraduate classes who can possibly take the time off should add his name to the list<br />\non the bulletin-board of those who are to accompany the team. The train leaves<br />\nUnion Station at 10.17 a. m., and it is expected that there will be a special car<br />\nfor the team and rooters. Every man who turns up tomorrow with a flag and<br />\na megaphone and, above all, a voice in good working order, is helping our team<br />\nto get the dash and spirit that they will need to win. All aboard!<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nHERE is one method of assisting the Musical Clubs in their work,\u2014a<br />\nmethod, too, which would produce practical and immediate results,\u2014<br />\nwhich is little practiced at the University. This is, the suggestion to<br />\nthe leaders of the various clubs of selections suitable for performance. \"It is<br />\nVery<br />\nthe leader's business to hunt up good pieces himself,\" someone says.<br />\ntrue; but it is also the leader's business to do a hundred other things with<br />\nwhich he cannot be helped by outsiders, and it will materially aid him in getting through his work to have ready at hand a large list of selections from<br />\nwhich to choose in making up a program. Of course, each leader attempts to<br />\nkeep up with the music of the day, and is constantly on the watch for \"something that will go,\" But it is impossible for any one man to keep track of the<br />\nmass of new songs, marches and waltzes that are produced every season. He<br />\ncan attend all the comic operas,\u2014and to some this may seem a not unpleasant<br />\ntask,\u2014be can keep his ears on the alert for a promising ditty whistled on the<br />\nstreet, and he can even, if he is a nervy man, write music himself. But he cannot fail to miss every season a certain number of new and old selections which<br />\nhe would have been glad to consider, and possibly to adopt. The moral of all<br />\nthis is, that every tuneful soul in the college has a chance to help the clubs by<br />\nsending in the names of pieces that he thinks will suit.<br />\nFor the Glee Club, \"close harmony\" and melodies of a kind to bring out<br />\nthe contrasts in the different voices are desired; for the Banjo Club, snappy<br />\nmarches and dances which set the foot involuntarily marking time; for the<br />\nMandolin Club, bright airs and dreamy waltzes. Some who read this may take<br />\nthe hint, and put the leaders on the track of some good music.<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nN another page appear some notes on Dr. Woodrow Wilson's inauguration<br />\nas President of Princeton University. President Wilson has been connected with many institutions of learning in this country\u2014Princeton,<br />\nWake Forest, Tulane, Vale, Bryn Mawr, Wesleyan, New York Law School.<br />\nFrom several of these he has received degrees. But we are proud to note, from<br />\nhis own words and declared policy, that his work at the Johns Hopkins, leading<br />\nto his Ph.D. in 1886, has ever been an especial source of inspiration and benefit<br />\nto him. He is in the first rank of our distinguished graduates, and our pride in<br />\nhim is mingled with congratulations on the early recognition of his worth.<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nGAIN comes the pleasant task of chronicling gifts to the University. The<br />\ndonation from Dr. Christian A. Herter, of New York, and his wife, of<br />\n$25,000 for a memorial lectureship in the medical department, is characterized by the medical faculty as \"a benefit, not only to the University, but to<br />\nthe medical profession throughout the country.\" And Mr. R. Brent Keyser,in<br />\npresenting $5000 for the services of landscape architects in surveying the Homewood grounds, has given most timely aid to a step which brings us a little<br />\nnearer to our constant aim\u2014the University at Homewood.<br /><br />\nt'C<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LE,\"I\"I'ER,<br /><br />\nHERE are now three places open on THE NEWS-LETTER board of editors.<br />\nTwo are for Freshmen,\u2014one as assistant athletic editor, and one as<br />\nassistant news editor.

There<br />\nwas at first some difficulty in getting the piano past the narrow banisters; but<br />\nthis was overcome by the combined ingenuity and strength of a few leading<br />\nspirits, and music held its pleasant sway.

A number of new and promising men had been gotten<br />\nout for several days before the game, and prospects were much brighter. One<br />\nor two slight injuries on the last practice day made it necessary to keep several<br />\nof the best men out, but notwithstanding this, it looked as if we were scheduled<br />\nfor victory over a team like Loyola. The results show that other troubles were<br />\non hand. The teams lined up before a crowd which could not be held within<br />\nbounds, and any long run around the end had to be zig-zagged through spectators scattered all over the field. Loyola kicked off, and Hopkins brought the<br />\nball back to the 45 yard line. Hitting the tackles proved effective and the ball<br />\nmoved along until fumble No. 1 gave Loyola the ball. The collegians fussed<br />\naround the ends for several downs and then lost the ball. It was Hopkins<br />\nsecond chance to \"get busy\" and they did it in great style,\u2014so great, in fact,<br />\nthat when fumble No. 2 occurred, a Loyola man took the ball on the jump and<br />\ndodged in and out among the crowd until he- reached the goal line. In this<br />\npoint the only park policeman became the most important factor in the game.<br />\nThe ball had been in play just eight minutes, but it was 4 o'clock, and a permit giving the grounds to the Indians and the Never Sweats from four to six<br />\ncame to view.
