On the other<br />\nhand, the teams were more or less<br />\nevenly matched.

Earnest,<br />\nJr., '19, has left the University,<br />\nand is therefore no longer a member of its editorial board. It also<br />\nwishes to announce that Arthur.<br />\nU. Hooper, '18, has been granted<br />\nleave of absence from the board<br />\nfor one year.<br />\nNeed for Systemization.<br />\n<br />\nThe conflict of dates was by no<br />\nmeans exceptional. Time and<br />\nagain, as every student activity<br />\nwill bear witness, such conflicts<br />\nhave occurred, and there have been<br />\neither poorly attended meetings,<br />\nor disheartening and entirely unnecessary postponements. None<br />\nof our organizations is so free of<br />\nproblems of its own which it must<br />\nwork out that it can afford to add<br />\nanother handicap to its list, especially when such a handicap, by<br />\nthe use of a little foresight, can be<br />\neasily eliminated.<br />\nThe solution is simple. Let no<br />\norganization have the right to call<br />\na meeting without the sanction of<br />\nthe Student Council; when the<br />\ntime for a meeting has been fixed,<br />\nsave in exceptional circumstances,<br />\nlet no other meeting be called for<br />\nthat hour. Then let the schedule<br />\nfor the week be prominently<br />\nposted on a bulletin board reserved for that especial purpose.<br />\nThere need be no red tape involved in such a scheme. The Student Council need not convene to<br />\nconsider every petition; two or<br />\nthree of its members can form a<br />\npermanent committee commissioned with power to consider all<br />\napplications. In general, it may<br />\nsafely be said that every organization can plan its meeting a week<br />\nin advance. There may, of course,<br />\nbe cases where two meetings are so<br />\nobviously devoid of any possibility<br />\nof conflict that they can be held<br />\nat the same time with perfect harmony, or cases where unusual circumstances warrant an overriding<br />\nof pre-arranged schedules. Such<br />\ncases could be left to the discretion of the committee; there need<br />\nbe no hard and fast rule\u2014only a<br />\nco-ordination, the machinery for<br />\nwhich is already in existence, and<br />\nwhich, in operation, would save a<br />\ngreat deal of confusion. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER respectfully submits<br />\nthe plan to the Student Council<br />\nfor consideration.<br />\n<br />\nOn Friday, three student organizations\u2014the Class of 1917, the<br />\nAdams Literary Society, and the<br />\nGlee Club\u2014were scheduled to<br />\nmeet, all at the same hour. All<br />\nthree meetings were important,<br />\nand there were many men who desired to be present at each. Nor<br />\nwas the conflict at all inevitable;<br />\nThe Adams.<br />\nin no ease would a slight change of<br />\nThe<br />\nreorganization of the<br />\ndate have 'caused inconvenience.<br />\nMoreover, in the hodge-podge of Adams Literary Society comes at<br />\nmiscellaneous advertisements, out- an appropriate time. There never<br />\nof-date notices, and exhibitions of has been question as to the deUniversity wit with which the stu- sirability of such a literary sodent bulletin board has been deco- ciety at Hopkins, but, in the past,<br />\nrated recently, the announcements the disadvantages of the town loof these meetings were extremely cation and the sense of unsettledinconspicuous, and there may very ness caused by the imminence of<br />\neasily have been cases when men the removal to Homewood offered<br />\ninterested in all three meetings serious obstacles to its permanent<br />\nwere ignorant of the existence of formation. This year is a formative period for all Hopkins, and it<br />\none.<br />\n<br />\nis fitting that, in it, the Adams<br />\nshould see the logical time for the<br />\nbeginning of its work.<br />\nFor three successive years, Hopkins has won the annual triangular debate between this University and the Universities of North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia. That is a<br />\nrecord of which any institution<br />\nmight be proud, and it is a record<br />\nwhich must be maintained. A<br />\nNorth Carolina exchange recently<br />\ncarried the announcement that a<br />\nfreshman debating society of 50<br />\nmen had been formed\u2014these men,<br />\nof course, it went on, not being<br />\neligible for either of the two university societies. If Hopkins<br />\nwishes to continue its unbroken<br />\nline of victories, it must develop<br />\nits literary material; and for such<br />\ndevelopment, the Adams offers opportunity.<br />\nYet the Adams will by no means<br />\nserve only as a subsidiary organization. It will have debates of its<br />\nown, both among its own members, and with the societies of<br />\nother universities, and it will<br />\nbring a community of interest to<br />\nmen for whom that community<br />\nhas always been a need distinctly<br />\nfelt. There is no institution of<br />\nHopkins' size or reputation in the<br />\ncountry which has not a literary<br />\nsociety among its most fixed institutions.<br />\nThe Adams should be supported<br />\nby men from every class, but to<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores particularly it offers unusual advantages.<br />\nThe men from these classes have<br />\nnot the training ground offered<br />\nby the Senior-Junior debate; in<br />\nthe past, their literary material<br />\nhas had comparatively no chance<br />\nof expansion. The Adams fulfills<br />\nthat want; it asks for support<br />\nfrom every student, and to every<br />\nstudent it affords the same opportunities.<br />\nA Gratifying Response.<br />\n<br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\nThe recent graduation of two<br />\nJapanese women from the University of Sandal, Japan, with the<br />\ndegree of rikakushi, or bachelor<br />\nof science, marks an epoch in the<br />\nadvance of education in Japan.<br />\nThe Imperial University w a s<br />\nopened to women four years ago.<br />\n\u2014Ex.<br />\n* * *<br />\nAn assessment of $57 is levied<br />\non each senior at the University<br />\nof California for the purpose of<br />\nraising a memorial trust fund of<br />\n$50,000.\u2014Ex.<br />\n* *<br />\nFire, fanned by a high wind,<br />\nvirtually destroyed the main<br />\nbuilding of the University of Wisconsin on October 10.

Time and<br />\nagain, as every student activity<br />\nwill bear witness, such conflicts<br />\nhave occurred, and there have been<br />\neither poorly attended meetings,<br />\nor disheartening and entirely unnecessary postponements. None<br />\nof our organizations is so free of<br />\nproblems of its own which it must<br />\nwork out that it can afford to add<br />\nanother handicap to its list, especially when such a handicap, by<br />\nthe use of a little foresight, can be<br />\neasily eliminated.<br />\nThe solution is simple. Let no<br />\norganization have the right to call<br />\na meeting without the sanction of<br />\nthe Student Council; when the<br />\ntime for a meeting has been fixed,<br />\nsave in exceptional circumstances,<br />\nlet no other meeting be called for<br />\nthat hour. Then let the schedule<br />\nfor the week be prominently<br />\nposted on a bulletin board reserved for that especial purpose.<br />\nThere need be no red tape involved in such a scheme. The Student Council need not convene to<br />\nconsider every petition; two or<br />\nthree of its members can form a<br />\npermanent committee commissioned with power to consider all<br />\napplications. In general, it may<br />\nsafely be said that every organization can plan its meeting a week<br />\nin advance. There may, of course,<br />\nbe cases where two meetings are so<br />\nobviously devoid of any possibility<br />\nof conflict that they can be held<br />\nat the same time with perfect harmony, or cases where unusual circumstances warrant an overriding<br />\nof pre-arranged schedules. Such<br />\ncases could be left to the discretion of the committee; there need<br />\nbe no hard and fast rule\u2014only a<br />\nco-ordination, the machinery for<br />\nwhich is already in existence, and<br />\nwhich, in operation, would save a<br />\ngreat deal of confusion. THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER respectfully submits<br />\nthe plan to the Student Council<br />\nfor consideration.<br /><br />\nOn Friday, three student organizations\u2014the Class of 1917, the<br />\nAdams Literary Society, and the<br />\nGlee Club\u2014were scheduled to<br />\nmeet, all at the same hour. All<br />\nthree meetings were important,<br />\nand there were many men who desired to be present at each. Nor<br />\nwas the conflict at all inevitable;<br />\nThe Adams.<br />\nin no ease would a slight change of<br />\nThe<br />\nreorganization of the<br />\ndate have 'caused inconvenience.<br />\nMoreover, in the hodge-podge of Adams Literary Society comes at<br />\nmiscellaneous advertisements, out- an appropriate time. There never<br />\nof-date notices, and exhibitions of has been question as to the deUniversity wit with which the stu- sirability of such a literary sodent bulletin board has been deco- ciety at Hopkins, but, in the past,<br />\nrated recently, the announcements the disadvantages of the town loof these meetings were extremely cation and the sense of unsettledinconspicuous, and there may very ness caused by the imminence of<br />\neasily have been cases when men the removal to Homewood offered<br />\ninterested in all three meetings serious obstacles to its permanent<br />\nwere ignorant of the existence of formation. This year is a formative period for all Hopkins, and it<br />\none.<br /><br />\nis fitting that, in it, the Adams<br />\nshould see the logical time for the<br />\nbeginning of its work.<br />\nFor three successive years, Hopkins has won the annual triangular debate between this University and the Universities of North<br />\nCarolina and Virginia. That is a<br />\nrecord of which any institution<br />\nmight be proud, and it is a record<br />\nwhich must be maintained. A<br />\nNorth Carolina exchange recently<br />\ncarried the announcement that a<br />\nfreshman debating society of 50<br />\nmen had been formed\u2014these men,<br />\nof course, it went on, not being<br />\neligible for either of the two university societies. If Hopkins<br />\nwishes to continue its unbroken<br />\nline of victories, it must develop<br />\nits literary material; and for such<br />\ndevelopment, the Adams offers opportunity.<br />\nYet the Adams will by no means<br />\nserve only as a subsidiary organization. It will have debates of its<br />\nown, both among its own members, and with the societies of<br />\nother universities, and it will<br />\nbring a community of interest to<br />\nmen for whom that community<br />\nhas always been a need distinctly<br />\nfelt. There is no institution of<br />\nHopkins' size or reputation in the<br />\ncountry which has not a literary<br />\nsociety among its most fixed institutions.<br />\nThe Adams should be supported<br />\nby men from every class, but to<br />\nfreshmen and sophomores particularly it offers unusual advantages.<br />\nThe men from these classes have<br />\nnot the training ground offered<br />\nby the Senior-Junior debate; in<br />\nthe past, their literary material<br />\nhas had comparatively no chance<br />\nof expansion.

The facts, as you<br />\nstated them, are sad and undeniable. Hopkins does lack spirit.<br />\nYou grew eloquent over this; then<br />\nyou placed part of the blame upon<br />\n\"six or eight men whose presence<br />\nwould strengthen the team a hundred per cent.\" Overlooking this<br />\nslight exaggeration, I found you<br />\nto be vague in pointing to the real<br />\ncause; and furthermore, you offered no logical remedy. You<br />\nknow that it is impossible to talk<br />\na man into \"spirit.\" That must<br />\ncome of its own accord. You say<br />\nthat.\"Hopkins has not awakened;<br />\nthe spirit which carried our eleven<br />\nthrough to the winning of the<br />\nstate championship last year has<br />\nbeen lost.\" You do not penetrate<br />\nfar enough. You say, \"the active<br />\nsupport which the student body<br />\nhas given its team has been so<br />\nslight, so casual, so utterly dispirited, that it has been worse<br />\nthan negligible. No cheering at<br />\nall would have been preferable to<br />\nthe cheering which has characterized the last three games. Some<br />\nmen do not come out to the<br />\ngames; others do not sit in the<br />\ncheering section; others sit in the<br />\nCheering section and are under<br />\nthe impression that the mere act<br />\nof sitting there fulfills every obligation which could ever rest<br />\nUpon them.\"<br />\nIn other words, the student<br />\nbody is utterly disinterested.
