The reception was held<br />\nto bring the out-of-town student in<br />\ntouch with the nearest church of his<br />\nown denomination.<br />\nThe University men, led by John<br />\nSherwood, started the meeting by<br />\nsinging some Hopkins songs. The<br />\nRev. Dr. Harris made the opening<br />\nprayer. Mr. Morriss, general secretary of the \"Y\", who acted as master of ceremonies, explained the<br />\npurpose of the reception. He said<br />\nhe would like the students to know<br />\nthat the Friends Meeting House.<br />\nwith its library, is always open to<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nThe ministers representing the<br />\nvarious denominations gave short<br />\nin the \"that-reminds-Me\"<br />\ntalks<br />\nvein, while Mr: Morriss held the<br />\nstopwatch.

Fast nearing the one hundred<br />\n-nark, this well-known figure in national and international circles is<br />\nstill active and healthy.<br />\nUnfortunately, the doctor's eyes<br />\nhave given him trouble, so that he<br />\nis forced to rely, in part, upon his<br />\nfriends and his memory for his associations with the classics which<br />\nhe loves so well. However, he is<br />\nkeeping steadily abreast of the<br />\ntimes and always a learned Greek<br />\nscholar, he now revels in the old<br />\nGreek classics, whose texts he reviews time and again in his sheer<br />\n'ove for and appreciation of their<br />\n)utstanding beauty.<br />\nThe anniversary of Dr. Gildersleeve's birth will be passed in the<br />\npresence of only a few of his<br />\nclosest friends.<br /><br />\nY. M. C. A. NOTICES<br />\nThe Y. M. C. A. has gone to<br />\nconsiderable expense in the purchase of a number of magazine<br />\ncovers, hoping to render current<br />\nmagazines more durable and convenient for the benefit of the students.

As a proof of this<br />\nprediction, models were exhibited<br />\nwhich are said to be capable of<br />\nplacing man on an equal basis with<br />\nwoman in this respect. A flexible<br />\nbelt secured to each side of the<br />\ntrousers is designed to fit closely<br />\nover the abdomen. When drawn<br />\nin and fastened, the arrangement<br />\ngives a decided corset-like appearance. Talk about the campus<br />\ns6ems to indicate that there will<br />\nbe a heavy sale of the new style<br />\ntrousers to the \"he-flappers\" who<br />\nare now prone to wear colored hat<br />\nbands on soft felt hats.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37659, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "bd72b5d6-3eea-4176-9eb2-05fffa4ac4b2", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13020-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13020, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "b52e93e6-a2a4-423b-ae92-f0de087609d1", "url": "/node/13020"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "3006a5ee-4e1a-4822-a43d-4fc755033ba6"}]}
