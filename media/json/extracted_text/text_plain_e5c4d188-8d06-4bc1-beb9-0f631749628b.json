The News-Letter feature columns this week have<br />\nbeen opened to two undergraduate discussions of this controversial<br />\nevent. Both writers have had available approximately the same<br />\nfactual information upon .wliich to base their judgment. The<br />\nresult is what appears to be an unbridgeable gap.<br />\nHere in the United States, and particularly in the critical,<br />\nIntellectual atmosphere of a college campus, one has long been<br />\naccustomed to the existence of violently opposed views derived<br />\nfrom the same set of facts. It is due to the circumstances that such<br />\nviews may be freely expressed that this nation, and the culture<br />\nwhich it exemplifies has become a dynamic, ever-growing social<br />\norganism.<br />\nIt is, of course, demonstrable that tangible. success in the attempts to resolve the contradictions of extreme and opposing views,<br />\nhas almost invariably grown out of a compromise, rather than out<br />\nof the surrender of one to the other.<br />\nWhere passion ends and \u2022reason begins, at that point is built<br />\nthe solid ground upon which progress and advancement eventually<br />\ngrow.<br />\nNot the emotional impulse alone, nor the cool, rational calculation by itself, rather elements of both determine the position which<br />\na given issue. When he compromises with another the product is<br />\nnot a murky indeterminate hodge-podge. It is, in fact, a. merger or<br />\nfusion of what Coleridge called \"the fundamental truths.\"<br />\nCompromisers are often the object of contempt by those who<br />\npride themselves in their own adherence to inflexible views. The<br />\nfiery ringing espousal of such views more often than not overshadows in glamour and impact the statement of the man who<br />\nhas succeeded in balancing extremes into a workable plan.<br />\nIt is the ability to search for these common truths which are<br />\nencouraged through the classroom, the library and the laboratory.<br />\nThis, too, is a mission of our University : to supplement. impulsive,<br />\nthough eminently honest idealism, in the mature individual.<br />\n<br />\nPARADOX AND BARTON<br />\nTo anyone who will look about him the Hopkins is a masterful<br />\nacademic paradox.

Yet one University President has departed and<br />\nanother comes on, both chanting hymns of praise to the humanities.<br />\nWhatever may be the roots of this devotion, it is surely awesome to witness the humanities prostrate before the best of laboratories and facilities available for the Hopkins science.<br />\nThe News-Letter begins this week a critical series of articles<br />\non the Hopkins curriculum. It is the hope of this publication that<br />\nthese articles may stimulate some serious discussion among the<br />\nfaculty and student body. It may well be to the advantage of the<br />\n\"academic values\" which Mr Barton so graciously emphasized to<br />\nfirst consider the condition of Hopkins humanities.<br />\nThe \"sympathies\" which this department is sincerely concerned with are a basic concept of educational objectives.

It is an old Hopkins<br />\ntradition to welcome the end of the winter basketball season with<br />\nIndian warhoops and a race for the gloves and pads of the spring ,<br />\nsport and this time the change is more than welcomed. It is also an<br />\nold Hopkins tradition to accept each basketball defeat with a<br />\ncareless shrug and a short \"Aw, wait 'til the lacrosse season.\"<br />\nThis year the careless shrug has turned into a desperate lunge.<br />\nIT CAN GO TOO FAR<br />\nBut in the whole-hearted swing from the cage to the stick<br />\ngame, the lacrossemen seem to be headed for deep waters. From<br />\nhead coach Howdy Myers right on down the line to manager<br />\nJohnny Clough, the lacrossemen are exuding confidence at every<br />\npore. Coach Myers blandly says that this will be the best team of<br />\nhis three years at Hopkins and Manager Clough has begun to talk<br />\nabout the Mount Washington game.

The News-Letter feature columns this week have<br />\nbeen opened to two undergraduate discussions of this controversial<br />\nevent. Both writers have had available approximately the same<br />\nfactual information upon .wliich to base their judgment. The<br />\nresult is what appears to be an unbridgeable gap.<br />\nHere in the United States, and particularly in the critical,<br />\nIntellectual atmosphere of a college campus, one has long been<br />\naccustomed to the existence of violently opposed views derived<br />\nfrom the same set of facts. It is due to the circumstances that such<br />\nviews may be freely expressed that this nation, and the culture<br />\nwhich it exemplifies has become a dynamic, ever-growing social<br />\norganism.<br />\nIt is, of course, demonstrable that tangible. success in the attempts to resolve the contradictions of extreme and opposing views,<br />\nhas almost invariably grown out of a compromise, rather than out<br />\nof the surrender of one to the other.<br />\nWhere passion ends and \u2022reason begins, at that point is built<br />\nthe solid ground upon which progress and advancement eventually<br />\ngrow.<br />\nNot the emotional impulse alone, nor the cool, rational calculation by itself, rather elements of both determine the position which<br />\na given issue. When he compromises with another the product is<br />\nnot a murky indeterminate hodge-podge. It is, in fact, a. merger or<br />\nfusion of what Coleridge called \"the fundamental truths.\"<br />\nCompromisers are often the object of contempt by those who<br />\npride themselves in their own adherence to inflexible views. The<br />\nfiery ringing espousal of such views more often than not overshadows in glamour and impact the statement of the man who<br />\nhas succeeded in balancing extremes into a workable plan.<br />\nIt is the ability to search for these common truths which are<br />\nencouraged through the classroom, the library and the laboratory.<br />\nThis, too, is a mission of our University : to supplement. impulsive,<br />\nthough eminently honest idealism, in the mature individual.<br /><br />\nPARADOX AND BARTON<br />\nTo anyone who will look about him the Hopkins is a masterful<br />\nacademic paradox. Its fame, money, and University's President*<br />\nare enwombed in science; its future will be determined by the<br />\nmating of those strange and dark buildings which are ringed about<br />\nGilman Hall. Yet one University President has departed and<br />\nanother comes on, both chanting hymns of praise to the humanities.<br />\nWhatever may be the roots of this devotion, it is surely awesome to witness the humanities prostrate before the best of laboratories and facilities available for the Hopkins science.<br />\nThe News-Letter begins this week a critical series of articles<br />\non the Hopkins curriculum. It is the hope of this publication that<br />\nthese articles may stimulate some serious discussion among the<br />\nfaculty and student body. It may well be to the advantage of the<br />\n\"academic values\" which Mr Barton so graciously emphasized to<br />\nfirst consider the condition of Hopkins humanities.<br />\nThe \"sympathies\" which this department is sincerely concerned with are a basic concept of educational objectives. This<br />\nUniversity must inspect its relationship to this objective \"in order<br />\nto further improve the academic values and teaching at<br />\nJohns Hopkins.\"<br /><br />\nbe inclined to wonder \"Who is<br />\nJohn Seth?\" For the man who is<br />\npresident of ODK and vice president of the Student Council seems<br />\nalmost an unknown quantity; a<br />\nforeign element in the familiar<br />\nhodgepodge of smiling student<br />\nleaders. \"Why he wasn't a politician when I was here,\" the returnee might say. \"What did he<br />\ndo to get elected?\"<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nVCE PRES/OE/VT O rHE\u2022<br />\nSTCVENT C0UN C/1.L4sr reAes Ep,-roe<br />\nrhoo News horre.e,<br />\nA \"Tom/NE/yr fr4ErA48.E12<br />\nAlEABER<br />\nAND<br />\nOF<br />\nYO)<br />\nof- ANYTH/HO<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nPt',<br /><br />\nt\u2022va<br /><br />\n7-Hi/vie<br />\nAEAL.<br />\n-FAT.TWAr)<br /><br />\nThe answer reveals Seth was<br />\nan entirely different type of campus leader.<br />\nNever an extrovert, Seth has<br />\nbeen a man behind the scenes during his stay at Hopkins. To make<br />\nup for his lack of conspicuousness<br />\nhe has used his soft-spoken power<br />\nand a shrewd sincerity in climbing<br />\nup through the hierarchy of campus leadership. His four year stay<br />\nat Hopkins has seen him running<br />\neverything from candy to political<br />\nmachines.<br />\nHis successes, however, have<br />\nnot \u2022 been without setbacks, and<br />\nthere are those who think that he<br />\nis more adept with the candy<br />\nmachines. Bucking for Senior Class<br />\npresidency last year Seth found<br />\nhimself up against a solid engineering department coalition. The<br />\nresult: he was edged out by only<br />\na few votes in a hard-fought,<br />\nhigh-pressure election.<br />\n\u20140-As a j9urnalist, he was far more<br />\nsuccessful.
