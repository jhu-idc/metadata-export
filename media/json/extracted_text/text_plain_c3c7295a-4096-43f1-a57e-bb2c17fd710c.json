Howard street, on<br />\ninvitation of Dr. W.E. Moseley. Dr.<br />\nWilfred Mustard, collegiate professor of Latin, read an interesting<br />\npaper on \"The Eclogues of Baptista<br />\nMantuanus.\"<br />\nThese were ten Latin poems<br />\nwritten in the second half of the<br />\nfifteenth century, and first printed<br />\nin the year 1498. They were immediately provided with a commentary, by a well-known scholar,<br />\nBadius Ascensius ; and for nearly<br />\ntwo hundred years they were very<br />\ncommonly used, both on the Continent and in England, as a text-book<br />\nin schools. And they had a very<br />\nconsiderable influence upon 'European literature of the sixteenth<br />\ncentury.<br />\nThe author was a Carmelite friar<br />\nof Mantua, who afterwards rose to<br />\nbe general of his order. He was<br />\nbeatified in 1885. His works were<br />\nvery popular, and he was hailed<br />\nby many of his contemporaries as<br />\na second Virgil. He is often quoted<br />\nin Elizabethan writers\u2014for example, in Shakespeare's \"Love's<br />\nLabours Lost.\" And his Eclogues<br />\nwere very frequently imitated, the<br />\nmost important instance being<br />\nSpenser's \"Shepherd's Calendar.\"<br />\n<br />\nLEFRANC & AULT<br />\n<br />\nHEART OF BALTIMORE TO HEART OF<br />\nWASHING!ON<br />\nTWENTY-FIVE MINUTES BEFORE EVERY<br />\nHOUR TO ANNAPOLIS<br />\nAND U.

Knapp, Ph, D., Associate Professor of Rhetoric in Goucher<br />\nCollege, and John C. French, Ph. D.,<br />\nAssociate in English in the Johns Hopkins University. The Macmillan Company. Price. $1.10 net.<br />\n<br />\nThis volume of occasional speeches, prepared by Professor Knapp<br />\nand Dr. French, is intended to supply a need which has come to the<br />\nattention of the authors in their<br />\nown teaching. It is intended to<br />\nafford the college student a collection of the best speeches delivered upon such occasions as are<br />\nlikely to confront him in his own<br />\ncareer.<br />\nConsequently in these<br />\npages we meet none of the timehonored models of forensic or parliamentary eloquence. Henry May<br />\nis represented not by the closing<br />\npassage of his speech on the Greek<br />\nRevolution nor on the Expunging<br />\nResolution, but by a few simple<br />\nand courteous words of welcome to<br />\nLafayette. Daniel Webster contributes, not the peroration of the Reply<br />\nto Hague, but a humble effort addressed to the Royal Agricultural<br />\nSociety of England. The collection<br />\nis intended not merely as a textbook, but also as a manual for the<br />\ngeneral reader, to which he may<br />\nturn for assistance when confronted<br />\nby that most embarassing of all<br />\nrequests, the invitation to make a<br />\nspeech. For this purpose the selections are classified according to<br />\nthe nature of the occasion upon<br />\nwhich they were delivered. Thus<br />\nthere are \"Speeches in Behalf of<br />\na Cause,\" \"Speeches of a President,\" \"Speeches of Welcome,\"<br />\n\"Speeches of Farewell,\" etc.<br />\nThe selections, which were for<br />\nthe most part chosen by Professor<br />\nKnapp are, on the whole, quite<br />\nappropriate. Because of the very<br />\nnature of the book, there are but<br />\nfew from the works of the world's<br />\ngreat orators and most are taken<br />\nfrom the sincere and informal utterances of scholars and statesmen of<br />\nthe past half century\u2014men like<br />\nBancroft, Emerson, Bryant, Root,<br />\nand Gildersleeve. It might seem,<br />\ntherefore, a matter for curiosity<br />\nhow a quaint and time-mellowed<br />\n,peech of Queen Elizabeth came to<br />\nfind its way into such company.<br />\nDr. French contributes an introduction of thirty-three pages, in<br />\nwhich he sets forth briefly and concisely the principles following<br />\nwhich a speech may be most effectivelr composed and delivered.<br />\nJ. S. D.<br />\n<br />\n23, 1911<br />\n<br />\nfriend of peace, he refused all the<br />\ninvitations sent him. In his work<br />\nwhich is called \"The Folly of<br />\nBuilding Temples of Peace with<br />\nUntempered Mortar\" (New York:<br />\nB. W. Huebsch), he states his<br />\nreasons for believing that the only<br />\nsolution of the problem of international peace is the abolition of<br />\nall protective tariffs.<br />\nHe says that the peace advocates<br />\ndo not realize that \"since our own<br />\nCivil War there has been a yet<br />\nmore flagrant war raging in our<br />\nown country, a war annually becoming more menacing and disastrous. It is not a civil war only,<br />\nbut a foreign war as well; a war not<br />\nagainst one nation only; but against<br />\nall commercial nations. It is a domestic as well as universal foreign<br />\nwar to enforce our preposterous<br />\nclaim to an average half of what any<br />\nforeign shipper brings to our<br />\nports.\"<br />\nThen the author follows with a<br />\ndetailed statement of all the wellknown objections to and arguments<br />\nagainst a protective tariff and say<br />\nthat it is not only economicay<br />\nfalse but is unconstitutional and immoral.<br />\nNot content with outlining his<br />\nreason for the failure, as he calls<br />\nit, of peace to be more universal,<br />\nand war to be relegated to the background, Mr. Bigelow offers a solution of the problem in a second<br />\nhalf, of the work which he<br />\ncalls; \"The Necessity of Building<br />\nTemples of Peace with Tempered<br />\nMortar.\" Here he outlines a new<br />\nrevenue system for the United<br />\nStates, which would be necessary<br />\nif a return to the free trade policy<br />\nwere adopted.<br />\nGovernmental partnership in<br />\npublic utilities, important inventions, and copyrighted books are<br />\nonly some of the things which he<br />\nsuggests. He says that he has long<br />\nbeen an advocate of the retention<br />\nby Congress of an interest in the<br />\nnatural resources of the country<br />\nbefore they are given over to private hands, and by a series of interesting calculations he shows what<br />\nthe returns would have been if this<br />\npolicy had been adopted.<br />\nEach reader will have to accept<br />\nthe book and its theories, some of<br />\nthem revolutionary, for just what<br />\nhe thinks them worth. After all,<br />\nthe whole question is whether the<br />\nUnited States and other nations<br />\nwould be justified in returning to<br />\na free trade policy, but the question<br />\nof whether a tariff is a vital hindrance to perpetual peace and the<br />\nsettlement of international differences without resort to the arbitrament of the sword is another<br />\nmatter, for which Mr. Bigelow<br />\nmakes out a fairly convincing case.<br />\nThe book ought to be of great,<br />\ninterest to the members of the Hopkins Arbitration Society who are<br />\nR.<br />\ndiscussing these questions.<br />\n<br />\nIn his latest work, John Bigelow,<br />\nformer United States minister to<br />\nFrance and one of the most distinguished American men of letters<br />\nnow living, maintains that the repeal of all of our protective tariff<br />\nlaws is necessary before there can<br />\nbe absolute peace between the<br />\nnations of the world, a consummation which so many societies are<br />\n\"Those rich guys,\" said Silvernow vigorously striving for.<br />\n\"eats venison because it ish<br />\nstein,<br />\nto<br />\nMr. Bigelow had been invited<br />\njoin a number of these organiza- . deer.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nI notice that the football management has scheduled a game with the<br />\nNavy on October 7th. Permit me<br />\nto register a protest against this apparent foolhardiness. Our team<br />\nnever reaches the height of its capability until the season is half completed; the late opening of the University, the consequent lateness of<br />\nbeginning of practice, the impossibility of getting out the Medical<br />\nSchool men in .the first weeks, all<br />\ncontribute to make our team at this<br />\ntime a mere shadow of what it will<br />\nbecome later. By hard work we<br />\nhave reached the standard of big<br />\ncollege teams. We have been allowed an opportunity to show if we<br />\ncan hold to this standard. The<br />\nNavy has said: \"You have boasted<br />\nso much that we'll give you a<br />\nchance. Let's see what you can<br />\ndo.\" In return, we shall play them<br />\nwith practically the weakest team<br />\nthat we can put on the field. Nothing will contribute so surely to send<br />\nus back to the rank of small colleges<br />\nas a failure to make a good showing<br />\nagainst the Navy. And who can be<br />\nidiotic enough to claim that we<br />\nshall make a good showing? In our<br />\nfirst game last year we were tied<br />\nby the Maryland Agricultural College; in our first game this year<br />\nwhat will not the Navy do to us?<br />\nOur pretensions to higher standing<br />\nwill become a pretense. Mr.- Yellott<br />\nwill grin for a whole week.

Owing to<br />\nthe failure of the junior class to<br />\npublish it last year, there was a<br />\ngreat deal of controversy as to who<br />\nshould publish it this year, the present junior class or the senior class.<br />\nIt was finally decided to get out a<br />\njoint book, each class choosing six<br />\nrepresentatives. The senior class<br />\nelected: Rosenthal, Tappan, Makel,<br />\nStockett, Burgan, and Wolfe. The<br />\njuniors chose: Haynes, Price,<br />\nRogers, Belt, Weyforth, and Lloyd.<br />\nAt a recent meeting of this board,<br />\nRosenthal was elected editor-inchief; Haynes, assistant editor-inchief: Belt and Makel, business<br />\nmanagers; and Tappan, Stockett,<br />\nBurgan, Wolfe, Price, Rogers,<br />\nVeyforth. and Lloyd, associate editors. The board will hold regular<br />\nmeetings every Wednesday night.<br />\nThis is the first time that the<br />\nscheme of a joint publication of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo has been tried by<br />\nsenior and junior classes of normal<br />\nsize. Two years ago there was a<br />\njoint book. But the reason for this<br />\nwas that the junior class had only<br />\nnine or tell members and could not<br />\npossibly think of getting the book<br />\nout alone. The plan is a good one<br />\nand the result will be watched with<br />\ngreat interest.<br />\nA Declining Art.<br />\n<br />\nTwenty years ago, when I was<br />\nan undergraduate, one of the<br />\nhighest honors that could come to<br />\na student was to be selected one<br />\nof a team to represent the college<br />\nin debate. I have observed that<br />\nthis achievement brings little distinction to the undergraduate today<br />\nill most institutions, which is to be<br />\nmuch regretted. The college world<br />\nis supposed to be the real world in<br />\nminiature. Certainly in this respect<br />\nit is not: for the world does recognize and gives its reward to the<br />\nman who can think quickly and<br />\naccurately and rise to his feet and<br />\ntell what he thinks. At Oxford the<br />\nstudent leaders win their spurs on<br />\nthe floor of the Union. In this<br />\ncountry we find too frequently fatheaded football men who have no<br />\nother qualification than their brute<br />\nstrength, flocked after sheep-like by<br />\nother students.

From the outset, both sides<br />\nwere so enthusiastic that the entrants needed no urging from their<br />\ncaptains to be present. Besides the<br />\nambition to win a medal, each<br />\nfreshman wanted to do his part<br />\ntoward breaking the records of last<br />\nyear's contest. The gymnasium<br />\nclass had been divided into two<br />\nsectfons, corresponding in ability, as<br />\nnearly as possible.<br />\nThe captain .of the Blues is<br />\nCeorge Dorsey; of the Whites,<br />\nStewart White.<br />\nOn Monday Professor Kistler<br />\ndecided to open the contest. The<br />\nfirst event was the pull-up. One<br />\npoint was given for each pull; in<br />\nthat way every one could add at<br />\nleast a few points to his side's<br />\nscore.<br />\nHinrichs (Whites) won first<br />\nplace with seventeen to his credit.<br />\nBryan (Whites) was second with<br />\nsixteen.<br />\nThe second event was the standing high jump and Hinrichs again<br />\nwon.<br />\nAlthough the Whites had made<br />\n174 point to their 162, in the first<br />\nday's work, the Blues determined<br />\nto struggle all the harder on Wednesday, caught up and passed the<br />\nWhites, much to the latter's<br />\nastonishment.<br />\nThe score now was 215 to 214.<br />\nThe records are as follows:<br />\nPull-ups\u2014This year, Hinrichs,<br />\n17; last year, H.

In the place<br />\nof Charlie Meyer, who was forced<br />\nto give up the position of head<br />\ncoach on account of his graduate<br />\nwork, Pitts Raleigh has taken<br />\ncharge of the team. Coach Raleigh<br />\nplayed first defence on the team<br />\nlast year, and is considered to be<br />\none of the best close defence men<br />\never produced by Hopkins.<br />\nThis year's captain, Eddie Hulbert, has adopted different tactics<br />\nfrom those used last year. He is<br />\nhaving the new men come out by<br />\nthemselves on Wednesdays, instead<br />\nof only the best men as last year.<br />\nThe whole squad is divided into<br />\ntwo sections, one of which practices<br />\non Mondays and Thursdays, and<br />\nthe other on Tuesdays and Fridays.<br />\nIt is necessary to have the old men<br />\nin the squads, in order to teach the<br />\nnew men the fine points of stick<br />\nwork. On Saturdays there is a<br />\nscrimmage, which usually lasts for<br />\nabout thirty-five minutes.<br />\nSince the Christmas holidays the<br />\nmen have been working very hard,<br />\nand as a result they begin to show<br />\na great improvement in condition.<br />\nThe general opinion is that the new<br />\ntactics are better than the old, and<br />\ngreat results are expected.<br />\nThe Tuesday and -Friday squad<br />\nconsists of Stockett, Schmeisser,<br />\nHuck, Hopkins, J. Burgan, Rosenthal, Richardson, Herman,Simpson,<br />\nHinrichs, Wilkens, Niles, Sears,<br />\nMakel, Simon, and Belt.<br />\nDr. Abercrombie has permitted<br />\nthe candidates for the Baltimore<br />\nCity College lacrosse team the use<br />\nof the \"cage\" on Tuesdays and<br />\nThursdays from three to four<br />\no'clock. Stockett, Huck, and Gillet<br />\nare coaching the youngsters, and it<br />\nis hoped that under their able instruction they may some day turn<br />\nout to be good 'varsity men.<br />\nThe regular Saturday squad consists of Stockett, Easter, Paulus,<br />\nGail, Wolfe, Gillet, Hopkins, Niles,<br />\nSutton, Huck, Price, Schmeisser,<br />\nSears, Benedict, Everton, Wolman,<br />\nRandall, and Bridgman.<br /><br />\n63 Limited Trains Every Day<br />\n(On the hour and half-hour)<br /><br />\nWashington, Baltimore and<br />\nAnnapolis Electric Railway<br /><br />\nThe Chess Club is showing that<br />\nit is a vital, living organization,<br />\none that has come to stay and which<br />\nwill add one more to the list of<br />\npermanent undergraduate activities.<br />\nThe captain of the team, W. E.<br />\nPearce, Jr., is in communication<br />\nwith the chess club of the Univvsity of Pennsylvania and it is likely<br />\nthat the date of the match will be<br />\nabout the middle of February. It<br />\nis to be a six-board match.<br />\nAt a meeting of the executive<br />\ncommittee on Friday the challenge<br />\nof the City College to the freshman<br />\nteam was considered. As there is<br />\nno freshman team here it was proposed to make up a seven-man team<br />\nfrom the players in the minor tournament to play the City College<br />\nteam. A committee of one was appointed to confer with the captain<br />\nof the City College team and<br />\narrange a date.<br />\nRecently.a chess club was formed<br />\nat the University of Maryland and<br />\nit was expected that the Hopkins<br />\nteam would receive a challenge from<br />\nthem. But this challenge has not<br />\ncome. So the captain of the Hopkins team was instructed to send<br />\na challenge to the University of<br />\nMaryland team for an eight-board<br />\nmatch to be played either on the 3d,<br />\n4th, or ioth of February. It is<br />\ndesired to have several matches<br />\nbefore the team goes to Philadelphia to play the strong team of<br />\nthe Pennsylvania University and so<br />\nit is necessary that these matches<br />\nbe played as soon as possible.<br />\nAll but five games of the minor<br />\ntournament have been played. The<br />\ntournament was to have come to a<br />\nclose on the 21st of January but<br />\nthe executive committee voted to<br />\nextend this time two weeks.<br />\nIt has been proposed to the freshman and sophomore classes to have<br />\nan interclass chess match. Such<br />\na match would add another to the<br />\nlist of contests between the classes<br />\nand would arouse great interest.<br />\nThis question will be voted on by<br />\nboth classes this week and the<br />\nteams will be chosen as soon as possible.<br />\nJunior Banquet Committee.<br /><br />\nPresident Wilmer Ray, of the<br />\nsophomore class has appointed the<br />\ncommittee to arrange the annual<br />\nclass banquet.

Howard street, on<br />\ninvitation of Dr. W.E. Moseley. Dr.<br />\nWilfred Mustard, collegiate professor of Latin, read an interesting<br />\npaper on \"The Eclogues of Baptista<br />\nMantuanus.\"<br />\nThese were ten Latin poems<br />\nwritten in the second half of the<br />\nfifteenth century, and first printed<br />\nin the year 1498. They were immediately provided with a commentary, by a well-known scholar,<br />\nBadius Ascensius ; and for nearly<br />\ntwo hundred years they were very<br />\ncommonly used, both on the Continent and in England, as a text-book<br />\nin schools. And they had a very<br />\nconsiderable influence upon 'European literature of the sixteenth<br />\ncentury.<br />\nThe author was a Carmelite friar<br />\nof Mantua, who afterwards rose to<br />\nbe general of his order. He was<br />\nbeatified in 1885. His works were<br />\nvery popular, and he was hailed<br />\nby many of his contemporaries as<br />\na second Virgil. He is often quoted<br />\nin Elizabethan writers\u2014for example, in Shakespeare's \"Love's<br />\nLabours Lost.\" And his Eclogues<br />\nwere very frequently imitated, the<br />\nmost important instance being<br />\nSpenser's \"Shepherd's Calendar.\"<br /><br />\nLEFRANC &amp; AULT<br /><br />\nHEART OF BALTIMORE TO HEART OF<br />\nWASHING!ON<br />\nTWENTY-FIVE MINUTES BEFORE EVERY<br />\nHOUR TO ANNAPOLIS<br />\nAND U.

Price. $1.10 net.<br /><br />\nThis volume of occasional speeches, prepared by Professor Knapp<br />\nand Dr. French, is intended to supply a need which has come to the<br />\nattention of the authors in their<br />\nown teaching. It is intended to<br />\nafford the college student a collection of the best speeches delivered upon such occasions as are<br />\nlikely to confront him in his own<br />\ncareer.<br />\nConsequently in these<br />\npages we meet none of the timehonored models of forensic or parliamentary eloquence. Henry May<br />\nis represented not by the closing<br />\npassage of his speech on the Greek<br />\nRevolution nor on the Expunging<br />\nResolution, but by a few simple<br />\nand courteous words of welcome to<br />\nLafayette. Daniel Webster contributes, not the peroration of the Reply<br />\nto Hague, but a humble effort addressed to the Royal Agricultural<br />\nSociety of England. The collection<br />\nis intended not merely as a textbook, but also as a manual for the<br />\ngeneral reader, to which he may<br />\nturn for assistance when confronted<br />\nby that most embarassing of all<br />\nrequests, the invitation to make a<br />\nspeech. For this purpose the selections are classified according to<br />\nthe nature of the occasion upon<br />\nwhich they were delivered. Thus<br />\nthere are \"Speeches in Behalf of<br />\na Cause,\" \"Speeches of a President,\" \"Speeches of Welcome,\"<br />\n\"Speeches of Farewell,\" etc.<br />\nThe selections, which were for<br />\nthe most part chosen by Professor<br />\nKnapp are, on the whole, quite<br />\nappropriate. Because of the very<br />\nnature of the book, there are but<br />\nfew from the works of the world's<br />\ngreat orators and most are taken<br />\nfrom the sincere and informal utterances of scholars and statesmen of<br />\nthe past half century\u2014men like<br />\nBancroft, Emerson, Bryant, Root,<br />\nand Gildersleeve. It might seem,<br />\ntherefore, a matter for curiosity<br />\nhow a quaint and time-mellowed<br />\n,peech of Queen Elizabeth came to<br />\nfind its way into such company.<br />\nDr. French contributes an introduction of thirty-three pages, in<br />\nwhich he sets forth briefly and concisely the principles following<br />\nwhich a speech may be most effectivelr composed and delivered.<br />\nJ. S. D.<br /><br />\n23, 1911<br /><br />\nfriend of peace, he refused all the<br />\ninvitations sent him. In his work<br />\nwhich is called \"The Folly of<br />\nBuilding Temples of Peace with<br />\nUntempered Mortar\" (New York:<br />\nB. W. Huebsch), he states his<br />\nreasons for believing that the only<br />\nsolution of the problem of international peace is the abolition of<br />\nall protective tariffs.<br />\nHe says that the peace advocates<br />\ndo not realize that \"since our own<br />\nCivil War there has been a yet<br />\nmore flagrant war raging in our<br />\nown country, a war annually becoming more menacing and disastrous. It is not a civil war only,<br />\nbut a foreign war as well; a war not<br />\nagainst one nation only; but against<br />\nall commercial nations. It is a domestic as well as universal foreign<br />\nwar to enforce our preposterous<br />\nclaim to an average half of what any<br />\nforeign shipper brings to our<br />\nports.\"<br />\nThen the author follows with a<br />\ndetailed statement of all the wellknown objections to and arguments<br />\nagainst a protective tariff and say<br />\nthat it is not only economicay<br />\nfalse but is unconstitutional and immoral.<br />\nNot content with outlining his<br />\nreason for the failure, as he calls<br />\nit, of peace to be more universal,<br />\nand war to be relegated to the background, Mr. Bigelow offers a solution of the problem in a second<br />\nhalf, of the work which he<br />\ncalls; \"The Necessity of Building<br />\nTemples of Peace with Tempered<br />\nMortar.\" Here he outlines a new<br />\nrevenue system for the United<br />\nStates, which would be necessary<br />\nif a return to the free trade policy<br />\nwere adopted.<br />\nGovernmental partnership in<br />\npublic utilities, important inventions, and copyrighted books are<br />\nonly some of the things which he<br />\nsuggests. He says that he has long<br />\nbeen an advocate of the retention<br />\nby Congress of an interest in the<br />\nnatural resources of the country<br />\nbefore they are given over to private hands, and by a series of interesting calculations he shows what<br />\nthe returns would have been if this<br />\npolicy had been adopted.<br />\nEach reader will have to accept<br />\nthe book and its theories, some of<br />\nthem revolutionary, for just what<br />\nhe thinks them worth. After all,<br />\nthe whole question is whether the<br />\nUnited States and other nations<br />\nwould be justified in returning to<br />\na free trade policy, but the question<br />\nof whether a tariff is a vital hindrance to perpetual peace and the<br />\nsettlement of international differences without resort to the arbitrament of the sword is another<br />\nmatter, for which Mr. Bigelow<br />\nmakes out a fairly convincing case.<br />\nThe book ought to be of great,<br />\ninterest to the members of the Hopkins Arbitration Society who are<br />\nR.<br />\ndiscussing these questions.<br /><br />\nIn his latest work, John Bigelow,<br />\nformer United States minister to<br />\nFrance and one of the most distinguished American men of letters<br />\nnow living, maintains that the repeal of all of our protective tariff<br />\nlaws is necessary before there can<br />\nbe absolute peace between the<br />\nnations of the world, a consummation which so many societies are<br />\n\"Those rich guys,\" said Silvernow vigorously striving for.<br />\n\"eats venison because it ish<br />\nstein,<br />\nto<br />\nMr. Bigelow had been invited<br />\njoin a number of these organiza- . deer.

Alumni especially are urged to<br />\nmake use of this column.)<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nI notice that the football management has scheduled a game with the<br />\nNavy on October 7th. Permit me<br />\nto register a protest against this apparent foolhardiness. Our team<br />\nnever reaches the height of its capability until the season is half completed; the late opening of the University, the consequent lateness of<br />\nbeginning of practice, the impossibility of getting out the Medical<br />\nSchool men in .the first weeks, all<br />\ncontribute to make our team at this<br />\ntime a mere shadow of what it will<br />\nbecome later. By hard work we<br />\nhave reached the standard of big<br />\ncollege teams. We have been allowed an opportunity to show if we<br />\ncan hold to this standard. The<br />\nNavy has said: \"You have boasted<br />\nso much that we'll give you a<br />\nchance. Let's see what you can<br />\ndo.\" In return, we shall play them<br />\nwith practically the weakest team<br />\nthat we can put on the field. Nothing will contribute so surely to send<br />\nus back to the rank of small colleges<br />\nas a failure to make a good showing<br />\nagainst the Navy. And who can be<br />\nidiotic enough to claim that we<br />\nshall make a good showing? In our<br />\nfirst game last year we were tied<br />\nby the Maryland Agricultural College; in our first game this year<br />\nwhat will not the Navy do to us?<br />\nOur pretensions to higher standing<br />\nwill become a pretense.

Owing to<br />\nthe failure of the junior class to<br />\npublish it last year, there was a<br />\ngreat deal of controversy as to who<br />\nshould publish it this year, the present junior class or the senior class.<br />\nIt was finally decided to get out a<br />\njoint book, each class choosing six<br />\nrepresentatives. The senior class<br />\nelected: Rosenthal, Tappan, Makel,<br />\nStockett, Burgan, and Wolfe. The<br />\njuniors chose: Haynes, Price,<br />\nRogers, Belt, Weyforth, and Lloyd.<br />\nAt a recent meeting of this board,<br />\nRosenthal was elected editor-inchief; Haynes, assistant editor-inchief: Belt and Makel, business<br />\nmanagers; and Tappan, Stockett,<br />\nBurgan, Wolfe, Price, Rogers,<br />\nVeyforth. and Lloyd, associate editors. The board will hold regular<br />\nmeetings every Wednesday night.<br />\nThis is the first time that the<br />\nscheme of a joint publication of<br />\nthe Hullabaloo has been tried by<br />\nsenior and junior classes of normal<br />\nsize. Two years ago there was a<br />\njoint book. But the reason for this<br />\nwas that the junior class had only<br />\nnine or tell members and could not<br />\npossibly think of getting the book<br />\nout alone. The plan is a good one<br />\nand the result will be watched with<br />\ngreat interest.<br />\nA Declining Art.<br /><br />\nTwenty years ago, when I was<br />\nan undergraduate, one of the<br />\nhighest honors that could come to<br />\na student was to be selected one<br />\nof a team to represent the college<br />\nin debate. I have observed that<br />\nthis achievement brings little distinction to the undergraduate today<br />\nill most institutions, which is to be<br />\nmuch regretted. The college world<br />\nis supposed to be the real world in<br />\nminiature. Certainly in this respect<br />\nit is not: for the world does recognize and gives its reward to the<br />\nman who can think quickly and<br />\naccurately and rise to his feet and<br />\ntell what he thinks.
