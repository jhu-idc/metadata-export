In the midst of record lows and a<br />\nstate of emergency through much of the Northeast and<br />\nMid-Atlantic, Hopkins has managed to operate smoothly<br />\nwith a steady fuel supply.<br />\nThe University has escaped the natural gas crisis because<br />\nit is an interruptible customer, and Baltimore Gas and<br />\nElectric had discontinued service on November 1. As one<br />\nof the lowest priority customers, Hopkins had been told of<br />\nthe November cut-off date well in advance (and also much<br />\nbefore any indication of the present cold spell). Last year,<br />\nthe University had gone only the month of November<br />\nwithout regular service; this time, Director of Plant<br />\nPlanning and Operations Bill Campbell expects the cut-off<br />\nto stretch to 150 days.<br />\nIn the meantime, Hopkins will rely almost exclusively<br />\non oil. The supplier, Shipley-Humble of York, Pa., expects<br />\n\"no immediate problem\" with the fuel supply, although<br />\ntanker shipment has obviously been halted by a frozen<br />\nChesapeake Bay. While Number 2 oil customers (including<br />\nhomes and Goucher College, among others) have been<br />\nhampered by the severe winter, the University, using<br />\nheavier, cruder Number 6 grade oil, has had little difficulty<br />\nwith supply.<br />\nThe places on campus which do require gas\u2014the dorm<br />\nand Levering cafeterias\u2014will not be affected by Governor<br />\nMandel's request for restaurants to close periodically. In<br />\nthe Bradford apartments, the only other University-owned<br />\nbuilding using natural gas, temperatures will be lowered to<br />\nthe 60-65 degree range.<br />\nCampbell said that thermostats will be reset throughout<br />\nthe campus to comply with the BG&E and Mandel<br />\nrecommendations. \"It isn't that we haven't been involved<br />\nin energy conservation since the oil embargo in 1973,\" he<br />\nnoted. \"It's just that after all the publicity, individuals<br />\ntend to forget how institutions are operating.<br />\nAs an interruptible gas customer, Hopkins has kept a<br />\nsecure secondary fuel supply\u2014oil\u2014to avoid the closings<br />\nthat area restaurants, stores and public schools face. With<br />\nthe extreme cold expected to last through February,<br />\nCambell doesn't anticipate any sudden unavailability of<br />\noil. \"We'll know very much in advance if something drastic<br />\nis going to happen,\" he commented. \"But continued hard<br />\nweather could have nothing but a bad effect.\"<br />\n<br />\nft*<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nscott marks<br />\n<br />\nLandes trio on Woolf<br />\nsee p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 2/news-letter/februarv 1. 1977<br />\nThe VVJHU News & Public Affairs<br />\nDept. is looking for campus reporters.<br />\nA meeting for mewcqmers and other<br />\ninterested individuals will be held<br />\nThursday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. in the<br />\nWJHU News Room-basement of the<br />\nNew Dorms.

Any clues, contact the N -L pronto!!<br />\n<br />\n(yawn)<br />\nThe bookstore is getting to be a real bore for everyone<br />\nthese days. People are tired of reading about it, student<br />\nleaders are surely sick of the yearly investigations and<br />\nreports, and we're certainly not thrilled with writing<br />\ncountless articles and editorials. Even the folks at Follett's<br />\nmust feel a desire to be put out of their misery.<br />\nSo this is the last race for a very dead horse. We suggest<br />\nonce again that professors fill their semester text orders<br />\nwith off-campus bookstores. Knowing the prompt souls<br />\nthat make up the faculty, the proposal of a co-operative<br />\nseems the best choice to replace Follett's Bookstore.

Thanks.<br />\nDouglas Richard Warren<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nI was indeed offended by the<br />\nNews-Letter's article on the<br />\nCarter inauguration, not that I<br />\nworship the president or the<br />\npresidency, but that the article<br />\nwas symptomatic of the pointless<br />\npokes at what promises to be an<br />\nadministration of considerable<br />\nprogress. The concentration of<br />\nNews-Letter criticism on the<br />\ninaugural and the pardoninw<br />\nshows a misdirection common in<br />\nmany criticisms of Carter:<br />\nattacks on largely symbolic<br />\nelements of an administration<br />\nshowing much more than<br />\nsymbolic change. To have given<br />\ncolumns of print to the<br />\ninauguration a subject that will<br />\nbe forgotten tomorrow, and to<br />\ngive none to the economic<br />\nstimulus'. program is simply<br />\nterrible reporting.<br />\nBut even worse is the idiot<br />\nharping on the problems of the<br />\ninauguration: there has been no<br />\nevent of such size in this country<br />\nwith, as reported. as few as seven<br />\nminor injuries. Even beyond<br />\nconfusion, the criticism makes an<br />\nodd sort of inside sarcasm about<br />\n.what is called the people's<br />\ninaugural. Sure tickets wen-<br />\n<br />\ntwenty five dollars: and what are<br />\nwe to compare this with: the '72<br />\ninaugural, which required tickets<br />\nwell into the thousands? Sure,<br />\nthe mass invitations were largely<br />\nsymbolic, but isn't it nice to have<br />\na president who is willing to<br />\nmake a gesture to the common<br />\nman, not fearing him, as we have<br />\nso sharply seen in the past? The<br />\nideal was to have a free inaugural<br />\nwith all the US, including<br />\nBankers, including sharecroppers,<br />\nattending, but is that possible?<br />\nTo use an ideal to criticise a real<br />\nchange is merely self-destructive;<br />\nthe same impulse almost gave<br />\nMcCarthy enough votes to elect a<br />\nman who by no view was the<br />\npeople's president: Ford. And<br />\nsuch useless idealism is<br />\nthreataning [sic] to hamstring<br />\nany positive action on the part of<br />\nany President; the unachievable<br />\nperfectionist idealogies of the far<br />\nleft, and the far right, are merely<br />\nbeing used to leave America in a<br />\ndirectionless abyss. The<br />\nNews-Letter should be glad to<br />\nhave a man who isn't more<br />\nconcerned with the pensions of<br />\nthe rich than the starvation of<br />\nthe poor. Any further, no matter<br />\nhow glittering prospects such<br />\nideals may be, is either<br />\nimpossible or implausible in<br />\nAmerica. And remember; it was<br />\nthe reform of FDR which made<br />\npossible America's rejection of<br />\noutmoded big business Smithian<br />\neconomics: not the unsuccessful<br />\npies in the skys of Norman<br />\nThomas; it was the domestic<br />\nreform of LBJ which makes<br />\npossible a true welfare state in<br />\nthis country, not the airy<br />\ngeneralizations of the McCarthy<br />\nNew Left. So Carter is working in<br />\na tradition of actual success, not<br />\nmerely slogans.<br />\nJosiah Heyman<br />\n<br />\nBy STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\nThe controversy surrounding<br />\n\"affirmative action\" in education<br />\nhas been re-ignited by a recent<br />\ndecision by the Supreme Court<br />\nof California that a special<br />\nadmissions program violated the<br />\nequal protection clause of the<br />\n14th Amendment.<br />\nIn 1974, Allan Bakke, a<br />\n36-year-old engineer, charged in a<br />\nlawsuit against the University of<br />\nCalifornia Medical School at<br />\nDavis that he was a victim of<br />\n\"invidious discrimination\"<br />\nbecause of the color of his<br />\nskin---white. He had applied for<br />\nadmission in 1973 and 1974 and<br />\nhad been rejected both times. Mr.<br />\nBakke had a 3.51 grade point<br />\naverage.<br />\nThe Medical School had<br />\nadmitted 100 students in its first<br />\nyear class. Sixteen places were<br />\nreserved for \"educationally or<br />\neconomically disadvantaged<br />\nstudents.\" These places were<br />\nfilled by minority students, some<br />\nof whose grade point averages fell<br />\nbelow 2.5. In the regular<br />\nadmissions program, applicants<br />\nwhose GPA fell below 2.5 were<br />\nsummarily denied admission.<br />\nThe court held that \"the<br />\nprogram, as administered by the<br />\nuniversity, violated the rights<br />\nguaranteed to nonminority<br />\napplicants by the equal<br />\nprotection clause of the U.S.<br />\nConstitution because it afforded<br />\npreference on the basis of race to<br />\npersons who, by the university's<br />\nown standards, were not as<br />\nqualified for the study of<br />\nmedicine as nonminority<br />\napplicants denied admission.\" A similar case arose in 1974<br />\nregarding admission to law<br />\nschool. In Marco Defunis v. the<br />\nUniversity of Washington Law<br />\nSchool, the U.S. Supreme Court<br />\nsidestepped the crucial issue,<br />\ndeclaring the case moot since<br />\nDefunis had been finally<br />\nadmitted and was about to<br />\ngraduate. In a dissent, former<br />\nSupreme Court Justice Douglas<br />\nstated: \"There is no<br />\nconstitutional right for any race<br />\nto be preferred....There is no<br />\nsuperior person by constitutional<br />\nstandards. A Defunis who is<br />\nwhite is entitled to no advantage<br />\nby reason of th at fact; nor is he<br />\nsubject to any disability no<br />\nmatter what his race or color.<br />\nWhatever his race, he had a<br />\nconstitutional right to have his<br />\napplication considered on its<br />\nindividual merits in a racially<br />\nneutral manner.\" (emphasis<br />\nmine)<br />\nIn addition, Justice Douglas<br />\ndeclared that the equal<br />\nprotection clause \"commands the<br />\nelimination of racial barriers, not<br />\ntheir creation in order to satisfy<br />\nour theory as to how society<br />\nought to be organized.\"<br />\nMinority admissions program were an outgrowth of the sixties<br />\ncivil rights movement which<br />\nsought full integration of<br />\nminorities into the business and<br />\nacademic communities.<br />\nInstitutions of higher learning<br />\nundertook a vigorous recruitment<br />\nof minority students, increased<br />\nfinancial assistance, and<br />\nestablished remedial programs for<br />\nthose of poor educational<br />\nbackground. The rationale that<br />\nunderlay such efforts was- that<br />\n<br />\napplicants from groups<br />\nhistorically discriminated against<br />\nwould not be excluded due to<br />\nlow grades or poor scores on<br />\nstandardized admission tests. A<br />\ntruly diverse student body ww.<br />\nseen as a benefit to the large'<br />\nsociety, for education has always<br />\nbeen perceived by reformers as a<br />\n\"foot in the door\" to those<br />\npreviously excluded from the<br />\nacademic system.<br />\nProponents of \"affirmative<br />\naction\" today use many of these<br />\nsame arguments-- special<br />\nadmissions will encourage<br />\nresponsible leadership among<br />\nminority groups, provide<br />\nguidance and inspiration to<br />\nminority youth, and build<br />\nconfidence in a legal system that<br />\nhas previously been indifferent, if<br />\nnot blatantly opposed, to their<br />\ninterests and needs.<br />\n<br />\nThose in favor of such<br />\nprograms point out that race is<br />\nnot only relevant but a major<br />\nfactor in the admissions process.<br />\nThey argue that we should not<br />\ndeceive ourselves into believing<br />\nthe myth of society according to<br />\nmeritocracy.<br />\nOne commentator has stated:<br />\n\"Efforts to equalized access to<br />\nhigher learning for minority<br />\nstudents exemplify the paradox<br />\nof institutional racism -- that<br />\nneutral institutional responses to<br />\nsituations in which prior<br />\ndiscrimination have produced<br />\nminority inequality do not<br />\nproduce equality of result, but<br />\ncrystallize the effects of past<br />\ninequities.\" According to this<br />\nview, racial classification as a<br />\npractical matter must be<br />\nemployed to counteract historic<br />\nracism. It is argued that there<br />\nexists a distinction between<br />\n\"invidious\" and remedial or<br />\n\"benign 'discrimination.<br />\nThe latter argument, grounded<br />\non semantics, is effectively<br />\nmeaningless. Larry Lavinsky, a<br />\nNew York lawyer who is national<br />\nchairman of the civil rights<br />\ndivision of the Anti- Defamation<br />\nLeague, comments: \"The<br />\nargument that a racial<br />\nclassification which discriminates<br />\nagainst white people is not<br />\ninherently suspect, implies that<br />\nthe white majority is monolithic<br />\nand so politcally powerful as not<br />\nto require the constitutional<br />\nsafeguards afforded minority<br />\nracial groups. But the white<br />\nmajority is pluralistic, containin<br />\nwithin itself a multitude of<br />\nreligious and other ethnic<br />\nminorities -- Catholics, Jews.<br />\nItalians, Irish, Poles -- and many<br />\nothers who are vulnerable to<br />\nprejudice and who to this day<br />\nsuffer the effects of past<br />\ndiscrimination.<br />\n<br />\nSuch groups have only<br />\nrecently. begun to enjoy the<br />\nbenefits of a free society and<br />\nshould mot be exposed to new<br />\ndiscriminatory bars, even if th ey<br />\nare raised in the cause of<br />\ncompensation to certain racial<br />\nminorities for past inequities.\"<br />\nProgressive legal organizations<br />\nsuch as the American Civil<br />\nLiberties Union and the National<br />\nLawyers Guild have begun to<br />\nspeak out against what they<br />\nconsider \"backsliding\" on the<br />\npart of the medical and legal<br />\nestablishments in their promises<br />\nto \"open up.\" Their argument<br />\nhas a seeming illogic to it\u2014that<br />\nequality, in this case, justifies, if<br />\nnot requires, discrimination. The<br />\nBay Area Third World Students<br />\nAlliance has stated: \"the recent<br />\nCalifornia Supreme Court<br />\ndecision is another blow struck at<br />\nthe few hard-won gains in rights<br />\nof minority peoples.\"<br />\nOpponents of reverse<br />\ndiscrimination constitute a varied<br />\ngroup, many of whom were the<br />\nmost enthusiastic supporters of<br />\ncivil rights struggles of the last<br />\ndecade. They contend that while<br />\nan integrated education is an<br />\nappropriate social goak, the<br />\nmanner in which this is being<br />\nachieved is racist in the true sense<br />\nof the word. The Washington<br />\nState Supreme Court ruling in<br />\nfavor of Defunis is generally<br />\nsupportive of this belief\u2014\"the<br />\nminority admissions policy is<br />\ncertainly not benign with respect<br />\nto nonminority students who are\u2022<br />\ndisplaced by it.\"<br />\n<br />\nCriterion<br />\nCritics feel that the criterion<br />\nfor special admissions programs<br />\nshould not be solely skin color<br />\nbut economic disadvantagement,<br />\nso that whites as well as blacks<br />\nmay qualify. Many believe that<br />\nthe admission of unqualified<br />\nstudents by professional schools<br />\nresults in a lowering of standards.<br />\nOthers have pointed out that<br />\nadmission under these<br />\ncircumstances actually<br />\nconstitutes as \"handicap\"for the<br />\napplicants themselves Self-confidence of minority<br />\nstudents is undermined when<br />\nthey feel that their place in class<br />\nis a function of race, and not<br />\ndemonstrated ability and<br />\nacademic promise.<br />\nAdmission policies in graduate<br />\neducation programs should not<br />\nbe ridden by racial quotas<br />\nrather, they should be flexible<br />\nenough to encompass a number<br />\nof factors in addition to grades<br />\nand test scores: personal<br />\ninterviews, recommendations,<br />\ncharacter, and cultural<br />\nbackground. If two students of<br />\nequal academic ability are<br />\nseeking admission, the minority<br />\nstudent should be given<br />\npreference. However, to choose<br />\none applicant over another solely<br />\nbecause the former is black,<br />\nchicano, or Puerto Rican is<br />\nclearly an affront to the applicant<br />\nas well as society at large.<br />\nIn the last analysis, such<br />\ndiscriminatory behavior is not<br />\ncorrective but generates further<br />\nracism and resistance to<br />\nintegration. The case for<br />\n\"affirmative action,\" then, is an<br />\nargument for deprivation. The<br />\nsearch for social justice is<br />\nill-served by its application.<br />\n<br />\n\fClass in the dumps:<br />\nWe call it garbology<br />\n<br />\nWho's afraid to talk about Albee?<br />\nBy MARK LANDES<br />\nHow'd you like Virginia<br />\nWoolf, Straightman?<br />\nS`kood, real good, Peabody.<br />\n3lad you had us come.

The problems<br />\nincluded shortages of required<br />\nreadings, late-arriving orders,<br />\nPoor faculty/management<br />\ncommunication, as well as<br />\ninaccurate and conflicting prices.<br />\nTaskforce chairman Sheldon<br />\nHimelfarb stressed that the<br />\nobjective of the inquiry was not<br />\nto compare Follett's prices to<br />\nthose of other profit-oriented<br />\ncollege bookstores.

Under the proposal,<br />\nthe structure of the first two<br />\nyears of Medical school or<br />\nscientific programs would be<br />\naltered to allow students to make<br />\ngreater use of Arts and Science<br />\nclasses offered at Homewood,<br />\nand additional faculty will be<br />\nadded to the Medical School.

People are tired of reading about it, student<br />\nleaders are surely sick of the yearly investigations and<br />\nreports, and we're certainly not thrilled with writing<br />\ncountless articles and editorials.

Thanks.<br />\nDouglas Richard Warren<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nI was indeed offended by the<br />\nNews-Letter's article on the<br />\nCarter inauguration, not that I<br />\nworship the president or the<br />\npresidency, but that the article<br />\nwas symptomatic of the pointless<br />\npokes at what promises to be an<br />\nadministration of considerable<br />\nprogress. The concentration of<br />\nNews-Letter criticism on the<br />\ninaugural and the pardoninw<br />\nshows a misdirection common in<br />\nmany criticisms of Carter:<br />\nattacks on largely symbolic<br />\nelements of an administration<br />\nshowing much more than<br />\nsymbolic change. To have given<br />\ncolumns of print to the<br />\ninauguration a subject that will<br />\nbe forgotten tomorrow, and to<br />\ngive none to the economic<br />\nstimulus'. program is simply<br />\nterrible reporting.<br />\nBut even worse is the idiot<br />\nharping on the problems of the<br />\ninauguration: there has been no<br />\nevent of such size in this country<br />\nwith, as reported. as few as seven<br />\nminor injuries. Even beyond<br />\nconfusion, the criticism makes an<br />\nodd sort of inside sarcasm about<br />\n.what is called the people's<br />\ninaugural. Sure tickets wen-<br /><br />\ntwenty five dollars: and what are<br />\nwe to compare this with: the '72<br />\ninaugural, which required tickets<br />\nwell into the thousands? Sure,<br />\nthe mass invitations were largely<br />\nsymbolic, but isn't it nice to have<br />\na president who is willing to<br />\nmake a gesture to the common<br />\nman, not fearing him, as we have<br />\nso sharply seen in the past? The<br />\nideal was to have a free inaugural<br />\nwith all the US, including<br />\nBankers, including sharecroppers,<br />\nattending, but is that possible?<br />\nTo use an ideal to criticise a real<br />\nchange is merely self-destructive;<br />\nthe same impulse almost gave<br />\nMcCarthy enough votes to elect a<br />\nman who by no view was the<br />\npeople's president: Ford. And<br />\nsuch useless idealism is<br />\nthreataning [sic] to hamstring<br />\nany positive action on the part of<br />\nany President; the unachievable<br />\nperfectionist idealogies of the far<br />\nleft, and the far right, are merely<br />\nbeing used to leave America in a<br />\ndirectionless abyss. The<br />\nNews-Letter should be glad to<br />\nhave a man who isn't more<br />\nconcerned with the pensions of<br />\nthe rich than the starvation of<br />\nthe poor. Any further, no matter<br />\nhow glittering prospects such<br />\nideals may be, is either<br />\nimpossible or implausible in<br />\nAmerica. And remember; it was<br />\nthe reform of FDR which made<br />\npossible America's rejection of<br />\noutmoded big business Smithian<br />\neconomics: not the unsuccessful<br />\npies in the skys of Norman<br />\nThomas; it was the domestic<br />\nreform of LBJ which makes<br />\npossible a true welfare state in<br />\nthis country, not the airy<br />\ngeneralizations of the McCarthy<br />\nNew Left. So Carter is working in<br />\na tradition of actual success, not<br />\nmerely slogans.<br />\nJosiah Heyman<br /><br />\nBy STEVE SCHULTZ<br />\nThe controversy surrounding<br />\n\"affirmative action\" in education<br />\nhas been re-ignited by a recent<br />\ndecision by the Supreme Court<br />\nof California that a special<br />\nadmissions program violated the<br />\nequal protection clause of the<br />\n14th Amendment.<br />\nIn 1974, Allan Bakke, a<br />\n36-year-old engineer, charged in a<br />\nlawsuit against the University of<br />\nCalifornia Medical School at<br />\nDavis that he was a victim of<br />\n\"invidious discrimination\"<br />\nbecause of the color of his<br />\nskin---white. He had applied for<br />\nadmission in 1973 and 1974 and<br />\nhad been rejected both times. Mr.<br />\nBakke had a 3.51 grade point<br />\naverage.<br />\nThe Medical School had<br />\nadmitted 100 students in its first<br />\nyear class. Sixteen places were<br />\nreserved for \"educationally or<br />\neconomically disadvantaged<br />\nstudents.\" These places were<br />\nfilled by minority students, some<br />\nof whose grade point averages fell<br />\nbelow 2.5. In the regular<br />\nadmissions program, applicants<br />\nwhose GPA fell below 2.5 were<br />\nsummarily denied admission.<br />\nThe court held that \"the<br />\nprogram, as administered by the<br />\nuniversity, violated the rights<br />\nguaranteed to nonminority<br />\napplicants by the equal<br />\nprotection clause of the U.S.<br />\nConstitution because it afforded<br />\npreference on the basis of race to<br />\npersons who, by the university's<br />\nown standards, were not as<br />\nqualified for the study of<br />\nmedicine as nonminority<br />\napplicants denied admission.\" A similar case arose in 1974<br />\nregarding admission to law<br />\nschool. In Marco Defunis v. the<br />\nUniversity of Washington Law<br />\nSchool, the U.S. Supreme Court<br />\nsidestepped the crucial issue,<br />\ndeclaring the case moot since<br />\nDefunis had been finally<br />\nadmitted and was about to<br />\ngraduate. In a dissent, former<br />\nSupreme Court Justice Douglas<br />\nstated: \"There is no<br />\nconstitutional right for any race<br />\nto be preferred....There is no<br />\nsuperior person by constitutional<br />\nstandards. A Defunis who is<br />\nwhite is entitled to no advantage<br />\nby reason of th at fact; nor is he<br />\nsubject to any disability no<br />\nmatter what his race or color.<br />\nWhatever his race, he had a<br />\nconstitutional right to have his<br />\napplication considered on its<br />\nindividual merits in a racially<br />\nneutral manner.\" (emphasis<br />\nmine)<br />\nIn addition, Justice Douglas<br />\ndeclared that the equal<br />\nprotection clause \"commands the<br />\nelimination of racial barriers, not<br />\ntheir creation in order to satisfy<br />\nour theory as to how society<br />\nought to be organized.\"<br />\nMinority admissions program were an outgrowth of the sixties<br />\ncivil rights movement which<br />\nsought full integration of<br />\nminorities into the business and<br />\nacademic communities.<br />\nInstitutions of higher learning<br />\nundertook a vigorous recruitment<br />\nof minority students, increased<br />\nfinancial assistance, and<br />\nestablished remedial programs for<br />\nthose of poor educational<br />\nbackground. The rationale that<br />\nunderlay such efforts was- that<br /><br />\napplicants from groups<br />\nhistorically discriminated against<br />\nwould not be excluded due to<br />\nlow grades or poor scores on<br />\nstandardized admission tests. A<br />\ntruly diverse student body ww.<br />\nseen as a benefit to the large'<br />\nsociety, for education has always<br />\nbeen perceived by reformers as a<br />\n\"foot in the door\" to those<br />\npreviously excluded from the<br />\nacademic system.<br />\nProponents of \"affirmative<br />\naction\" today use many of these<br />\nsame arguments-- special<br />\nadmissions will encourage<br />\nresponsible leadership among<br />\nminority groups, provide<br />\nguidance and inspiration to<br />\nminority youth, and build<br />\nconfidence in a legal system that<br />\nhas previously been indifferent, if<br />\nnot blatantly opposed, to their<br />\ninterests and needs.<br /><br />\nThose in favor of such<br />\nprograms point out that race is<br />\nnot only relevant but a major<br />\nfactor in the admissions process.<br />\nThey argue that we should not<br />\ndeceive ourselves into believing<br />\nthe myth of society according to<br />\nmeritocracy.<br />\nOne commentator has stated:<br />\n\"Efforts to equalized access to<br />\nhigher learning for minority<br />\nstudents exemplify the paradox<br />\nof institutional racism -- that<br />\nneutral institutional responses to<br />\nsituations in which prior<br />\ndiscrimination have produced<br />\nminority inequality do not<br />\nproduce equality of result, but<br />\ncrystallize the effects of past<br />\ninequities.\" According to this<br />\nview, racial classification as a<br />\npractical matter must be<br />\nemployed to counteract historic<br />\nracism. It is argued that there<br />\nexists a distinction between<br />\n\"invidious\" and remedial or<br />\n\"benign 'discrimination.<br />\nThe latter argument, grounded<br />\non semantics, is effectively<br />\nmeaningless. Larry Lavinsky, a<br />\nNew York lawyer who is national<br />\nchairman of the civil rights<br />\ndivision of the Anti- Defamation<br />\nLeague, comments: \"The<br />\nargument that a racial<br />\nclassification which discriminates<br />\nagainst white people is not<br />\ninherently suspect, implies that<br />\nthe white majority is monolithic<br />\nand so politcally powerful as not<br />\nto require the constitutional<br />\nsafeguards afforded minority<br />\nracial groups. But the white<br />\nmajority is pluralistic, containin<br />\nwithin itself a multitude of<br />\nreligious and other ethnic<br />\nminorities -- Catholics, Jews.<br />\nItalians, Irish, Poles -- and many<br />\nothers who are vulnerable to<br />\nprejudice and who to this day<br />\nsuffer the effects of past<br />\ndiscrimination.<br /><br />\nSuch groups have only<br />\nrecently. begun to enjoy the<br />\nbenefits of a free society and<br />\nshould mot be exposed to new<br />\ndiscriminatory bars, even if th ey<br />\nare raised in the cause of<br />\ncompensation to certain racial<br />\nminorities for past inequities.\"<br />\nProgressive legal organizations<br />\nsuch as the American Civil<br />\nLiberties Union and the National<br />\nLawyers Guild have begun to<br />\nspeak out against what they<br />\nconsider \"backsliding\" on the<br />\npart of the medical and legal<br />\nestablishments in their promises<br />\nto \"open up.\" Their argument<br />\nhas a seeming illogic to it\u2014that<br />\nequality, in this case, justifies, if<br />\nnot requires, discrimination. The<br />\nBay Area Third World Students<br />\nAlliance has stated: \"the recent<br />\nCalifornia Supreme Court<br />\ndecision is another blow struck at<br />\nthe few hard-won gains in rights<br />\nof minority peoples.\"<br />\nOpponents of reverse<br />\ndiscrimination constitute a varied<br />\ngroup, many of whom were the<br />\nmost enthusiastic supporters of<br />\ncivil rights struggles of the last<br />\ndecade. They contend that while<br />\nan integrated education is an<br />\nappropriate social goak, the<br />\nmanner in which this is being<br />\nachieved is racist in the true sense<br />\nof the word. The Washington<br />\nState Supreme Court ruling in<br />\nfavor of Defunis is generally<br />\nsupportive of this belief\u2014\"the<br />\nminority admissions policy is<br />\ncertainly not benign with respect<br />\nto nonminority students who are\u2022<br />\ndisplaced by it.\"<br /><br />\nCriterion<br />\nCritics feel that the criterion<br />\nfor special admissions programs<br />\nshould not be solely skin color<br />\nbut economic disadvantagement,<br />\nso that whites as well as blacks<br />\nmay qualify. Many believe that<br />\nthe admission of unqualified<br />\nstudents by professional schools<br />\nresults in a lowering of standards.<br />\nOthers have pointed out that<br />\nadmission under these<br />\ncircumstances actually<br />\nconstitutes as \"handicap\"for the<br />\napplicants themselves Self-confidence of minority<br />\nstudents is undermined when<br />\nthey feel that their place in class<br />\nis a function of race, and not<br />\ndemonstrated ability and<br />\nacademic promise.<br />\nAdmission policies in graduate<br />\neducation programs should not<br />\nbe ridden by racial quotas<br />\nrather, they should be flexible<br />\nenough to encompass a number<br />\nof factors in addition to grades<br />\nand test scores: personal<br />\ninterviews, recommendations,<br />\ncharacter, and cultural<br />\nbackground. If two students of<br />\nequal academic ability are<br />\nseeking admission, the minority<br />\nstudent should be given<br />\npreference. However, to choose<br />\none applicant over another solely<br />\nbecause the former is black,<br />\nchicano, or Puerto Rican is<br />\nclearly an affront to the applicant<br />\nas well as society at large.<br />\nIn the last analysis, such<br />\ndiscriminatory behavior is not<br />\ncorrective but generates further<br />\nracism and resistance to<br />\nintegration. The case for<br />\n\"affirmative action,\" then, is an<br />\nargument for deprivation. The<br />\nsearch for social justice is<br />\nill-served by its application.<br /><br />\nClass in the dumps:<br />\nWe call it garbology<br /><br />\nWho's afraid to talk about Albee?<br />\nBy MARK LANDES<br />\nHow'd you like Virginia<br />\nWoolf, Straightman?<br />\nS`kood, real good, Peabody.<br />\n3lad you had us come.
