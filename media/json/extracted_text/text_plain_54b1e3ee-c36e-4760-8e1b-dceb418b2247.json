On this occasion two faculty members were<br />\nthe speakers. An audienfe of this<br />\nsize is considered highly satisfactory by the IRC. It is, of course,<br />\ntrue that Only about a third of<br />\nthose present were undergraduates, so that the IRC was fulfilling<br />\n-a broader function than that ordinarily expected from an undergraddate club.<br />\nObviously, IRC can keep in<br />\nbusiness by properly publicising<br />\nits meetings in the Baltimore<br />\npress, without very great undergraduate participation. This has<br />\nbeen shown to be true on numerous occasions when audiences of<br />\nclose to a hundred persons took<br />\npart in forum discussions On each<br />\nof these occasions, the -speakers<br />\nwere faculty members of this institution or others in the neighborhood.<br />\nQuestir Asked<br />\nThe question, then, simply boils<br />\ndown to this: do undergraduates<br />\nwant to listen to famous people<br />\nin order, to obtain spiritual uplift<br />\nand a feeling of being in the presence of History, or do they want<br />\nto come to an informal discussion<br />\nand participate in a less glamorous attempt to become familiar<br />\nwith some important problem of<br />\npublic concern.<br />\nBoth aims, certainly, are legitimate enough; IRC, however, is<br />\nconcerned\u2014as a rule\u2014only with<br />\nthe latter. It has no intention to<br />\nimpose itself upon the undergraduate student body by highpressure salesmanship: it solicits<br />\nmembership only ,from those students genuinely interested in international problems, and it invites members of the faculty and<br />\nthe public to widen the base of its<br />\ndiscussion and bring to its meetings a broader experience than is<br />\nnormally found among undergraduates.<br />\n<br />\nLike Shakespeare<br />\nIn the land of Maria, citizens<br />\nare proclaiming the literary efforts<br />\nof their hero.

They divided the scrolls<br />\nbetween them; four of the manuscripts<br />\nwere sold to the Syrian Monastery of St.<br />\nMark while the Hebrew University of<br />\nMount Scopus acquired the other four.<br />\nIt was not until March, 1948, that Dr.<br />\nAlbright was called upon to determine the<br />\nauthenticity of these scrolls. The scrolls<br />\nwere thought to be over 2,000 years old.<br />\nAfter examining the prints of the scrolls<br />\nthat were sent to him from Palestine, Dr.<br />\n<br />\nAlbright was thoroughly convinced that<br />\n.this was indeed \"the greatest manuscript<br />\ndiscovery of modern times.\"<br />\nScrolls Authentic<br />\n\"There is no doubt in 17101 mind,\" he<br />\nwrote to a fellow arhaecheologist in 1948,<br />\n\"that the script is more archaic than that<br />\nof the Nash Papyrus.<br />\n\"I should prefer a date around 100 BC.<br />\nAnd there can happily be not the slightest doubt in the world about the genuineness of the, manuscript.\"<br />\nFour of the scrolls belonging to the<br />\nmonastery of St. Mark have been loaded<br />\nto the Library of Congress and three of<br />\nthem are now on exhibition at the Library.<br />\nBaltimoreans will be able to view the<br />\nscrolls beginning the week of Novenkber 13<br />\nfor a,two week period at the Walters Art<br />\nGallery.<br />\nBooks Displayed<br />\nOne of th'e four scrolls, the lost Book<br />\nof Lamech, will not be placed on public<br />\nexhibition due to its very poor condition.<br />\nThis fourth scroll is believed to contain a<br />\ndescription of the birth of Noah. It will<br />\nbe extremely difficult to unroll- this manuscript for it has turned to charcoal.<br />\nThe most valuable of the scrolls and<br />\nthe best preserved is the almost complete<br />\ntext of Isaiah. Also to be placed on display<br />\nwill be a manuscript containing part of the<br />\ncommentary on the Habakkuk (see cut)<br />\nwhich is attributed to the first century BC<br />\nand another scroll containing a list of the<br />\nrituals and doctrines of a Jewish sect.<br />\nThese scrolls are most important according to Dr. Albright for \"the light they<br />\nshed on the Old Testament and the background of the New Testament.\" The ancient works are aU written in Aramaic.<br />\nWere Hidden<br />\nThe theory of how the scrolls were put<br />\nin the cave is that they were hidden in the<br />\ncaves by the Jews during a time of great<br />\ndanger.<br />\nThe Maccabees had revolted from foreign<br />\ndomination and in 167 BC they established<br />\nan independent state. Then in 37 BC, the<br />\nJews, still under the leadership of the<br />\nMaccabees, were conquered by King Herod<br />\nthe Great; it was during this period that<br />\nthe scrolls were probably stored in the cave.<br />\nEach individual scroll was wrapped in<br />\nlinen and then placed in an earthen jar.<br />\nAfter this was done all of the jars were<br />\ncarefully sealed. The jar containing the<br />\nBook of Lamech \"probably was broken and<br />\nthat would explain why this particular<br />\nscroll was found in such a deteriorated<br />\ncondition.\"<br />\nDebate Begins<br />\n\"Now the great debate begins,\" Dr. Albright explained. \"Who wrote the documents and how did we know, that they<br />\nare authentic?\" Those will be the issues<br />\nthat Biblical scholars will argue.<br />\nDr. Albright, who has played an important part in determining the autbenticity of these scrolls claims that he \"never<br />\nhad a motnente doubt about these manu-<br />\n<br />\nscripts\" and after examining prints of!<br />\nthem he was convinced that \"these could<br />\nnever have been forged.\"<br />\nAnd just how were these documents<br />\ndated?

They divided the scrolls<br />\nbetween them; four of the manuscripts<br />\nwere sold to the Syrian Monastery of St.<br />\nMark while the Hebrew University of<br />\nMount Scopus acquired the other four.<br />\nIt was not until March, 1948, that Dr.<br />\nAlbright was called upon to determine the<br />\nauthenticity of these scrolls.

Also to be placed on display<br />\nwill be a manuscript containing part of the<br />\ncommentary on the Habakkuk (see cut)<br />\nwhich is attributed to the first century BC<br />\nand another scroll containing a list of the<br />\nrituals and doctrines of a Jewish sect.<br />\nThese scrolls are most important according to Dr. Albright for \"the light they<br />\nshed on the Old Testament and the background of the New Testament.\" The ancient works are aU written in Aramaic.<br />\nWere Hidden<br />\nThe theory of how the scrolls were put<br />\nin the cave is that they were hidden in the<br />\ncaves by the Jews during a time of great<br />\ndanger.<br />\nThe Maccabees had revolted from foreign<br />\ndomination and in 167 BC they established<br />\nan independent state. Then in 37 BC, the<br />\nJews, still under the leadership of the<br />\nMaccabees, were conquered by King Herod<br />\nthe Great; it was during this period that<br />\nthe scrolls were probably stored in the cave.<br />\nEach individual scroll was wrapped in<br />\nlinen and then placed in an earthen jar.<br />\nAfter this was done all of the jars were<br />\ncarefully sealed. The jar containing the<br />\nBook of Lamech \"probably was broken and<br />\nthat would explain why this particular<br />\nscroll was found in such a deteriorated<br />\ncondition.\"<br />\nDebate Begins<br />\n\"Now the great debate begins,\" Dr. Albright explained. \"Who wrote the documents and how did we know, that they<br />\nare authentic?\" Those will be the issues<br />\nthat Biblical scholars will argue.<br />\nDr. Albright, who has played an important part in determining the autbenticity of these scrolls claims that he \"never<br />\nhad a motnente doubt about these manu-<br /><br />\nscripts\" and after examining prints of!<br />\nthem he was convinced that \"these could<br />\nnever have been forged.\"<br />\nAnd just how were these documents<br />\ndated?
