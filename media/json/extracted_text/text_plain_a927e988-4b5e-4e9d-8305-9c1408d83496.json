For if the University, in time of crisis, should decide to hamstring its own judicial system by simply removing every member of the board, the discipline process<br />\nwould come to a halt, and the student involved would have no<br />\nrecourse. To be sure, a student involved in a disciplinary procedure could accomplish the same end by removing every panel<br />\nmember to whom he objected and the University would then be<br />\nstuck. Neither prospect is encouraging.<br />\nMore important than either of the points mentioned earlier,<br />\nhowever, is the fact that no code would have any validity whatever if the Board of Trustees, as the ultimate legal authority of<br />\nthe University, should decide to suspend it during some crisis.<br />\nThe only way students can be reasonably assured this will not<br />\noccur is if the Trustees delegate to the Dean of Students and the<br />\nindividually constituted hearing board final authority to deal<br />\nwith all discipline matters. Until this unlikely event occurs, it is<br />\npointless even to bother with the drafting of a code of disciplinary procedures. Until such delegation is forthcoming, the SC<br />\n.would serve itself better by moving on to other matters.<br />\n<br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAssuming that the interview<br />\nwith the two new assistants to the<br />\n1C19..\\-,<br />\n,<br />\n111K(.1<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nI seem to notice that there is no<br />\nprotest being organized by our<br />\ndear eiected student council.<br />\ncu_<br />\n41111.1<br />\n<br />\n..01fte.1111. \u2022<br />\n<br />\n//<br />\n<br />\nfl<br />\n(Heir wows, Y<br />\nAlttiflUity reflects<br />\nmust take offense<br />\nwith the<br />\n<br />\nstatement of intention by Mr.<br />\nShinkman: \"We hope to make this<br />\nplace into a true university.\"<br />\nDoes he mean to say that Johns<br />\nHopkins is not a true university?

Last week three bikes were<br />\nreported stolen in this paper, and<br />\nlater that day thieves ripped off<br />\ntwo more from the bike rack<br />\nbetween Maryland and Shaffer<br />\nHalls. One of them was my<br />\nroommate's new beauty. And I'm<br />\nnot a newcomer to this game<br />\neither: my first 10-speed was<br />\nstolen two years ago, and I almost<br />\nlost one last year in the dorm<br />\nbasement. Well, this article offers<br />\nyou cyclists and would-be cyclists<br />\nsome specific advice for keeping<br />\nyour bicycle to a ripe age.<br />\nFirst of all, please don't think<br />\nyour bike won't ever be stolen,just<br />\ncause it's one among so many, or<br />\nbecause you think it's well-locked.<br />\nThe chances are it isn't, and alot of<br />\npeople are finding this out at<br />\nirt71frM1171Virr=<br />\nit...77\"'<br />\n-''<br />\n'l<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nLII<br />\n<br />\nGreat Bicycle Robbery Game, one<br />\n<br />\nfor the crooks and one for us.<br />\n<br />\nTheirs is to steal; that's easy.

Most cyclists, believe<br />\nA.C.L.U., the serious pressure for<br />\nit or not, don't follow the<br />\nimpeachment of President Nixon<br />\nprinciples of this little code. Let's<br />\narose out of his most recent<br />\nanalyze it.<br />\nconfrontation with the judiciary.<br />\nThe locking system is<br />\nand Congress, ostensibly over the<br />\nilioney- dependant while the rest is<br />\nmatter of the White House tapes.<br />\nup to you. Don't expect to spend<br />\nThe apparent waning of this<br />\nless than $8-10 for a decent chain<br />\npressure is the direct consequence<br />\nor cable and lock. I would actually<br />\nof Nixon's political decision to<br />\nfigure about $10-15 these days,<br />\ncapitulate on that issue.<br />\nbut it's still worth it. Ask yourself<br />\nLast weekend with the tape<br />\nif you'd rather spend ten dollars<br />\nissue joined, liberals and some<br />\nnow, or hassle one-hundred dollars<br />\nconservatives suddenly, and I use<br />\nlater. If you already have a<br />\nthe word advisedly, concluded that<br />\nchain/cable and lock, please read<br />\nviolations of the \"rule of law\" by<br />\non. It's a safe bet that your locking<br />\nthe Administration warranted<br />\nsystem is not good enough to<br />\nserious consideration for the first \u2022 protect your bike from today's<br />\ntime of impeachment.

It will revive false<br />\nhopes that America can easily<br />\nbecome what it is not now.<br />\n<br />\nstrong and thick. That's the<br />\ntrouble--they only look strong,<br />\nthanks to the thick plastic coating.<br />\nIt's three times the size of the<br />\nscrawny cable inside, and they<br />\ndon't work,just ask my roommate.<br />\nIf you must have them, buy about<br />\nfive.<br />\nThere's alot of controversy<br />\nabout which i better, cable or<br />\nchain, and there really is no one<br />\nanswer per se. Cable is lighter, and<br />\ncan take more flexing under stress,<br />\nbut chain is less expensive and<br />\nlooks, to crooks, impressive. Inch<br />\nfor inch (diameter-wise) they're<br />\nabout the same strength, and bad<br />\ncable is just as worthless as bad<br />\nchain. Here, safety is definitely<br />\nqualified --i.e. money-- dependent,<br />\nsince it is best to buy<br />\nmany-stranded, tightly woven<br />\nwires in a cable, or \"hardened\"<br />\nsteel for chain.\"Hardened\" stuff is<br />\n<br />\nstamped so, ask the salesman to<br />\nshow you proof that it is, i.e., on<br />\nthe manufacturers' box.<br />\nRemember, most salespeople are<br />\nout to make a buck, and many of<br />\nthem just don't know or care<br />\nabout what a really good<br />\nchain/lock is. You, on the other<br />\nhand, want to protect your bike,<br />\nnot get a runaround. As a<br />\nconsumer, be ruthless. Always ask<br />\nsalespeople for the facts, and don't<br />\nworry--it won't ruin them if you<br />\ndon't buy their $2.95 Hong Kong<br />\nflea-collar chain and lock. If that's<br />\nall they have, turn around and<br />\nleave;<br />\nLet me tell you what my<br />\npersonal locking system consists<br />\nof. Last week I sent to California<br />\nfor a 6-foot by 5/16\" vinyl coated<br />\ncable which I'll use with a<br />\nhardened Master key-type lock:<br />\nthat's my mobile system which I<br />\n<br />\nITITTe<br />\nT/TUre: Apensirt.., our IT<br />\nworks. \"Case-hardened\" stuff, as<br />\nit's called, is virtually impossible to<br />\n<br />\na<br />\ncase-hardened lock; about $15. I've<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n5-feet<br />\n<br />\nbust, is heaviest, and is the<br />\nultimate. ,<br />\nThe point is that any regular<br />\nchain or cable up to the /<br />\n14\" size<br />\ngives crooks the edge, because<br />\nequipment this size is often low<br />\nquality (soft or brittle) besides<br />\nbeing small enough to break easily.<br />\nMy advice is to stay above this size<br />\nin regular chain or cable, unless<br />\nyou buy the hardened chain; then<br />\nyou can dip into the /<br />\n1<br />\n4\"-3/16\" size<br />\nrange. Good plastic-coated cable,<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4\" six feet, runs about $4-5; six<br />\nfeet of regular /<br />\n14<br />\n\" chain is less,<br />\nwhile six feet of smaller<br />\n\"hardened\" chain is probably $6-7.<br />\nDon't let these technical sizes<br />\nbother you if you can't remember<br />\nthem. Just keep in mind: if you<br />\ncan, buy thick cable, \"Hardened\"<br />\nchain, or thick regular,<br />\nnon-hardened chain.<br />\nNow for the lock. Again, don't<br />\nscrimp--don't make your lock the<br />\nweak link of your system. Best bet<br />\nis a key -lock, since<br />\ncombination-lock faces can be<br />\ncrushed and opened. The shackle,<br />\nor curved part of the lock, should<br />\nbe as thick as the chain or cable<br />\nyou're buying. Hardened locks are<br />\navailable everywhere, and are'<br />\nusually stamped \"hardened\"<br />\nsomewhere, and cost about $3-6.<br />\nIf a supposedly \"hardened\" or<br />\n\"case-hardened\" chain or lock isn't<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nby<br />\n<br />\nchain<br />\n<br />\n7/b\"<br />\n<br />\nana<br />\n<br />\nleft the whole 10 pounds of it at<br />\nmy favorite location, and always<br />\nlock my bike there when I'm on<br />\ncampus. I guarantee it will stop all<br />\nbut nuclear-minded crooks. And<br />\nbesides all this, I have a few other<br />\nmiscellaneous locks and chains<br />\nwhich I can use as back-up<br />\nsystems; however, they're not<br />\nreally necessary. Sure, I've spent<br />\nover $20, but I have almost total<br />\nprotection, and never carry more<br />\nthan 17 ounces of cable on my<br />\nlightweight bike. Either system is<br />\ngood enough for you.<br />\nAll of the equipment mentioned<br />\nis available in Baltimore, the chains<br />\nand some cables at hardware<br />\nstores, the rest at good bike stores.<br />\nSee the addresses at the end of this<br />\narticle, which include my Calif.<br />\nstore, a bike-alarm store, and about<br />\nthe largest bike store in Baltimore.<br />\nBut don't confine yourself to<br />\nBaltimore; get a good system<br />\nwherever you can.<br />\nSo now you have a good idea of<br />\nwhat to buy in a locking system.<br />\nPlease, even if you've only just<br />\ntuned in on this paragraph, lock<br />\nyour ENTIRE bike, which means<br />\nthrough both wheels, frame and<br />\nfinally post or rack. You'd be<br />\nsurprised how many people don't<br />\ndo this. The minimum size in cable<br />\nor chain you'll need is about five<br />\nfeet, but six-foot lengths are<br />\n<br />\n\u2022V \" \u2022<br />\n<br />\nrobberies. Maybe a little move is in<br />\norder here (hint)? Anyway, for us<br />\ncyclists: assuming you put your<br />\nbike in the rack head or tail-first,<br />\nthe way you're supposed to, it<br />\nbecomes evident that one really<br />\nneeds alot of chain or cable length<br />\nto properly lock your bike, like<br />\ntwo individual pieces, or a single<br />\npiece 8 to 9 feet long, and they're<br />\nnot common, although the Calif.<br />\nstore has these long cables. Myself,<br />\nI still prefer locking to trees,<br />\nrailings, tall sign-posts, and maybe<br />\nto the outside ends of bike racks.<br />\nDo what you can.<br />\nWell, that's the story: a thick<br />\ncable or chain(/<br />\n1<br />\n4\"), hardened lock<br />\nand shackle, good locking<br />\nprocedure and a noticeable<br />\nlocation. You people who have<br />\nlocks already, check them against<br />\nthe figures in this article, and if<br />\nthey don't measure up, I'd stronglv<br />\ning system<br />\ngoo<br />\nan ia<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nwill<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\ncontinue<br />\nto scale oil oueves<br />\n<br />\npossibly forever, and not just at<br />\nHopkins either but wherever yOu<br />\ncycle. And don't throw your old<br />\nHong Kong special away. Use it as<br />\na back-up system, like I do, trade<br />\nthem in, or wear them. But don't<br />\nlet your possibly faulty system<br />\nkeep you from buying what you<br />\nreally need for cycling today.<br />\nIf you ever come across<br />\nsomeone ripping off your bike,<br />\nbest thing to do, if you're not<br />\nKung Fu, or armed, is to holler<br />\nyour head off--from a distance,<br />\nperhaps. Throw your books at the<br />\nguy if you can, create attention.<br />\nBelieve me, they'll run, thieves<br />\nhate a fuss.<br />\nIt's funny. You'll never really<br />\nknow what a tragedy it is 'until<br />\nyour own bike is stolen, and all<br />\nthat's left is a little piece of cut<br />\nchain or cable. You get that<br />\nstomach-sickening feeling, then<br />\nyou get mad, and suddenly even<br />\n$20 isn't too much to spend for<br />\nsafety. Don't get caught with your<br />\npants down--and with a Hong Kong<br />\nspecial.

Calling for an initial hearing either by a hearing board<br />\ncomposed of members of the campus community, or by the<br />\nDean of Students with appeal to a hearing board, the proposed<br />\ncode now goes to the Homewood Advisory Council, where we<br />\nhope it will die a quick and total death. For this code is just the<br />\nlatest in a long series of ill-conceived, sloppily drawn and irresponsible discipline proposals advanced here over the past three<br />\nyears.<br />\nStarting with the now infamous Benton code promulgated by<br />\nDr. George S. Benton when he was Dean of Arts and Sciences<br />\nthree years ago, and culminating Tuesday in the SC action on<br />\nthe most recent guidelines, every proposal advanced has suffered the same major flaw -- the student has no defense against arbitrary and capricious acts on the' part of University authorities.<br />\nThe provision of the code which allows either the University<br />\nor the student to remove any of the randomly chosen members<br />\nof the hearing board renders absurd whdt is supposed to be a<br />\nfair and impartial process. For if the University, in time of crisis, should decide to hamstring its own judicial system by simply removing every member of the board, the discipline process<br />\nwould come to a halt, and the student involved would have no<br />\nrecourse. To be sure, a student involved in a disciplinary procedure could accomplish the same end by removing every panel<br />\nmember to whom he objected and the University would then be<br />\nstuck. Neither prospect is encouraging.<br />\nMore important than either of the points mentioned earlier,<br />\nhowever, is the fact that no code would have any validity whatever if the Board of Trustees, as the ultimate legal authority of<br />\nthe University, should decide to suspend it during some crisis.<br />\nThe only way students can be reasonably assured this will not<br />\noccur is if the Trustees delegate to the Dean of Students and the<br />\nindividually constituted hearing board final authority to deal<br />\nwith all discipline matters. Until this unlikely event occurs, it is<br />\npointless even to bother with the drafting of a code of disciplinary procedures. Until such delegation is forthcoming, the SC<br />\n.would serve itself better by moving on to other matters.<br /><br />\nletters<br />\nto the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nAssuming that the interview<br />\nwith the two new assistants to the<br />\n1C19..\\-,<br />\n,<br />\n111K(.1<br />\n.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nI seem to notice that there is no<br />\nprotest being organized by our<br />\ndear eiected student council.<br />\ncu_<br />\n41111.1<br /><br />\n..01fte.1111. \u2022<br /><br />\n//<br /><br />\nfl<br />\n(Heir wows, Y<br />\nAlttiflUity reflects<br />\nmust take offense<br />\nwith the<br /><br />\nstatement of intention by Mr.<br />\nShinkman: \"We hope to make this<br />\nplace into a true university.\"<br />\nDoes he mean to say that Johns<br />\nHopkins is not a true university?

Last week three bikes were<br />\nreported stolen in this paper, and<br />\nlater that day thieves ripped off<br />\ntwo more from the bike rack<br />\nbetween Maryland and Shaffer<br />\nHalls. One of them was my<br />\nroommate's new beauty. And I'm<br />\nnot a newcomer to this game<br />\neither: my first 10-speed was<br />\nstolen two years ago, and I almost<br />\nlost one last year in the dorm<br />\nbasement. Well, this article offers<br />\nyou cyclists and would-be cyclists<br />\nsome specific advice for keeping<br />\nyour bicycle to a ripe age.<br />\nFirst of all, please don't think<br />\nyour bike won't ever be stolen,just<br />\ncause it's one among so many, or<br />\nbecause you think it's well-locked.<br />\nThe chances are it isn't, and alot of<br />\npeople are finding this out at<br />\nirt71frM1171Virr=<br />\nit...77\"'<br />\n-''<br />\n'l<br />\n11<br /><br />\nLII<br /><br />\nGreat Bicycle Robbery Game, one<br /><br />\nfor the crooks and one for us.<br /><br />\nTheirs is to steal; that's easy.

Most cyclists, believe<br />\nA.C.L.U., the serious pressure for<br />\nit or not, don't follow the<br />\nimpeachment of President Nixon<br />\nprinciples of this little code. Let's<br />\narose out of his most recent<br />\nanalyze it.<br />\nconfrontation with the judiciary.<br />\nThe locking system is<br />\nand Congress, ostensibly over the<br />\nilioney- dependant while the rest is<br />\nmatter of the White House tapes.<br />\nup to you. Don't expect to spend<br />\nThe apparent waning of this<br />\nless than $8-10 for a decent chain<br />\npressure is the direct consequence<br />\nor cable and lock. I would actually<br />\nof Nixon's political decision to<br />\nfigure about $10-15 these days,<br />\ncapitulate on that issue.<br />\nbut it's still worth it. Ask yourself<br />\nLast weekend with the tape<br />\nif you'd rather spend ten dollars<br />\nissue joined, liberals and some<br />\nnow, or hassle one-hundred dollars<br />\nconservatives suddenly, and I use<br />\nlater. If you already have a<br />\nthe word advisedly, concluded that<br />\nchain/cable and lock, please read<br />\nviolations of the \"rule of law\" by<br />\non. It's a safe bet that your locking<br />\nthe Administration warranted<br />\nsystem is not good enough to<br />\nserious consideration for the first \u2022 protect your bike from today's<br />\ntime of impeachment.

Cable is lighter, and<br />\ncan take more flexing under stress,<br />\nbut chain is less expensive and<br />\nlooks, to crooks, impressive. Inch<br />\nfor inch (diameter-wise) they're<br />\nabout the same strength, and bad<br />\ncable is just as worthless as bad<br />\nchain. Here, safety is definitely<br />\nqualified --i.e. money-- dependent,<br />\nsince it is best to buy<br />\nmany-stranded, tightly woven<br />\nwires in a cable, or \"hardened\"<br />\nsteel for chain.\"Hardened\" stuff is<br /><br />\nstamped so, ask the salesman to<br />\nshow you proof that it is, i.e., on<br />\nthe manufacturers' box.<br />\nRemember, most salespeople are<br />\nout to make a buck, and many of<br />\nthem just don't know or care<br />\nabout what a really good<br />\nchain/lock is. You, on the other<br />\nhand, want to protect your bike,<br />\nnot get a runaround. As a<br />\nconsumer, be ruthless. Always ask<br />\nsalespeople for the facts, and don't<br />\nworry--it won't ruin them if you<br />\ndon't buy their $2.95 Hong Kong<br />\nflea-collar chain and lock. If that's<br />\nall they have, turn around and<br />\nleave;<br />\nLet me tell you what my<br />\npersonal locking system consists<br />\nof. Last week I sent to California<br />\nfor a 6-foot by 5/16\" vinyl coated<br />\ncable which I'll use with a<br />\nhardened Master key-type lock:<br />\nthat's my mobile system which I<br /><br />\nITITTe<br />\nT/TUre: Apensirt.., our IT<br />\nworks. \"Case-hardened\" stuff, as<br />\nit's called, is virtually impossible to<br /><br />\na<br />\ncase-hardened lock; about $15. I've<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n5-feet<br /><br />\nbust, is heaviest, and is the<br />\nultimate. ,<br />\nThe point is that any regular<br />\nchain or cable up to the /<br />\n14\" size<br />\ngives crooks the edge, because<br />\nequipment this size is often low<br />\nquality (soft or brittle) besides<br />\nbeing small enough to break easily.<br />\nMy advice is to stay above this size<br />\nin regular chain or cable, unless<br />\nyou buy the hardened chain; then<br />\nyou can dip into the /<br />\n1<br />\n4\"-3/16\" size<br />\nrange. Good plastic-coated cable,<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n4\" six feet, runs about $4-5; six<br />\nfeet of regular /<br />\n14<br />\n\" chain is less,<br />\nwhile six feet of smaller<br />\n\"hardened\" chain is probably $6-7.<br />\nDon't let these technical sizes<br />\nbother you if you can't remember<br />\nthem. Just keep in mind: if you<br />\ncan, buy thick cable, \"Hardened\"<br />\nchain, or thick regular,<br />\nnon-hardened chain.<br />\nNow for the lock. Again, don't<br />\nscrimp--don't make your lock the<br />\nweak link of your system. Best bet<br />\nis a key -lock, since<br />\ncombination-lock faces can be<br />\ncrushed and opened. The shackle,<br />\nor curved part of the lock, should<br />\nbe as thick as the chain or cable<br />\nyou're buying. Hardened locks are<br />\navailable everywhere, and are'<br />\nusually stamped \"hardened\"<br />\nsomewhere, and cost about $3-6.<br />\nIf a supposedly \"hardened\" or<br />\n\"case-hardened\" chain or lock isn't<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nby<br /><br />\nchain<br /><br />\n7/b\"<br /><br />\nana<br /><br />\nleft the whole 10 pounds of it at<br />\nmy favorite location, and always<br />\nlock my bike there when I'm on<br />\ncampus. I guarantee it will stop all<br />\nbut nuclear-minded crooks. And<br />\nbesides all this, I have a few other<br />\nmiscellaneous locks and chains<br />\nwhich I can use as back-up<br />\nsystems; however, they're not<br />\nreally necessary. Sure, I've spent<br />\nover $20, but I have almost total<br />\nprotection, and never carry more<br />\nthan 17 ounces of cable on my<br />\nlightweight bike. Either system is<br />\ngood enough for you.<br />\nAll of the equipment mentioned<br />\nis available in Baltimore, the chains<br />\nand some cables at hardware<br />\nstores, the rest at good bike stores.<br />\nSee the addresses at the end of this<br />\narticle, which include my Calif.<br />\nstore, a bike-alarm store, and about<br />\nthe largest bike store in Baltimore.<br />\nBut don't confine yourself to<br />\nBaltimore; get a good system<br />\nwherever you can.<br />\nSo now you have a good idea of<br />\nwhat to buy in a locking system.<br />\nPlease, even if you've only just<br />\ntuned in on this paragraph, lock<br />\nyour ENTIRE bike, which means<br />\nthrough both wheels, frame and<br />\nfinally post or rack. You'd be<br />\nsurprised how many people don't<br />\ndo this. The minimum size in cable<br />\nor chain you'll need is about five<br />\nfeet, but six-foot lengths are<br /><br />\n\u2022V \" \u2022<br /><br />\nrobberies. Maybe a little move is in<br />\norder here (hint)? Anyway, for us<br />\ncyclists: assuming you put your<br />\nbike in the rack head or tail-first,<br />\nthe way you're supposed to, it<br />\nbecomes evident that one really<br />\nneeds alot of chain or cable length<br />\nto properly lock your bike, like<br />\ntwo individual pieces, or a single<br />\npiece 8 to 9 feet long, and they're<br />\nnot common, although the Calif.<br />\nstore has these long cables. Myself,<br />\nI still prefer locking to trees,<br />\nrailings, tall sign-posts, and maybe<br />\nto the outside ends of bike racks.<br />\nDo what you can.<br />\nWell, that's the story: a thick<br />\ncable or chain(/<br />\n1<br />\n4\"), hardened lock<br />\nand shackle, good locking<br />\nprocedure and a noticeable<br />\nlocation. You people who have<br />\nlocks already, check them against<br />\nthe figures in this article, and if<br />\nthey don't measure up, I'd stronglv<br />\ning system<br />\ngoo<br />\nan ia<br />\n11<br /><br />\nwill<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\ncontinue<br />\nto scale oil oueves<br /><br />\npossibly forever, and not just at<br />\nHopkins either but wherever yOu<br />\ncycle. And don't throw your old<br />\nHong Kong special away. Use it as<br />\na back-up system, like I do, trade<br />\nthem in, or wear them. But don't<br />\nlet your possibly faulty system<br />\nkeep you from buying what you<br />\nreally need for cycling today.<br />\nIf you ever come across<br />\nsomeone ripping off your bike,<br />\nbest thing to do, if you're not<br />\nKung Fu, or armed, is to holler<br />\nyour head off--from a distance,<br />\nperhaps. Throw your books at the<br />\nguy if you can, create attention.<br />\nBelieve me, they'll run, thieves<br />\nhate a fuss.<br />\nIt's funny. You'll never really<br />\nknow what a tragedy it is 'until<br />\nyour own bike is stolen, and all<br />\nthat's left is a little piece of cut<br />\nchain or cable. You get that<br />\nstomach-sickening feeling, then<br />\nyou get mad, and suddenly even<br />\n$20 isn't too much to spend for<br />\nsafety. Don't get caught with your<br />\npants down--and with a Hong Kong<br />\nspecial.
