Perhaps a few critical observations might help avoid the disastrous finalization of certain defects.<br />\nIn a recent incident, one well respected and well<br />\nbehaved undergraduate was attacked by a library employee for sitting in a reading area with his feet supported on an adjacent chair. The student courteously<br />\nacknowledged the reprimand, removed his feet and<br />\nasked, with great civility, what could be the harm in that<br />\nposture, especially considering that he had removed<br />\nhis shoes so as not to soil the chair. His antagonist apparently construed this as the supreme impudence, and<br />\nused the occasion as pretext for the venting of all his<br />\npersonal frustrations. The irritable attendant concluded<br />\nin an officious huff, but returned a little later to instruct another student not to lean on the back of his<br />\nchair. The only reason explicit in his raving concern for<br />\nthe library furniture seems to have been belief that<br />\nthe chair could not withstand the rigors of normal use.<br />\nChairs of subnormal durability and attendants of abnormal volatility are hardly conducive to good study<br />\nor congenial atmosphere.<br />\n<br />\nPerhaps some provision can he worked out to allow<br />\nchecker a few minutes to himself for lunch in<br />\nbook<br />\nthe<br />\nthe evening. It is somewhat distasteful to be greeted<br />\nby his open lunch box and wax paper sandwiches immediately upon entering that great building. It is, at<br />\nleast, an informality incongruent with the demand that<br />\nstudents keep feet from chairs.

He usually heard everything<br />\nPaul said. Jeff was fond of his<br />\nroommate. You could tell by the<br />\nway he listened to everything he<br />\nsaid. But Paul had this particular 'thing' about Western movies<br />\nthat made him a difficult person<br />\nat times to live with. He had<br />\nseen every western movie and<br />\nlived for the next one. His favorite star was John Wayne and<br />\nhe had a John Wayne gun and<br />\na John Wayne holster t:iat he<br />\noiled all the time. The thing was,<br />\nhe could never be killed. He called his gun X Caliber and Jeff's<br />\nlittle cap gun seemed impotent<br />\nnext to Paul's shiny, big, oiled<br />\nweapon. Jeff would shoot at a<br />\nrange of two feet and Paul would<br />\n<br />\npivot his neck on ...day or the<br />\nother, dance to the right, wheel<br />\naround with a \"Ping, you missed,\" and fire back with X Cali.<br />\nber. Jeff always died The hammer of X Caliber had a double<br />\nclick on it and Paul could draw<br />\nit out of his. holster, double<br />\nclick it so fast that it sounded<br />\nlike only one click, then snap<br />\nthe hammer down so fast that<br />\nthe trigger click often merged<br />\nwith the first two. He was fast.<br />\nThe real key to Paul was his<br />\nsensitivity to noise or danger.<br />\nJeff would slowly open his desk<br />\ndrawer to get his gun, acting as<br />\nthough he was getting paper or<br />\nink. Over in the corner you<br />\ncould hear a quiet 'clock\"click'.<br />\nPaul never died. There were<br />\ntimes when you could catch him<br />\noff guard\u2014but he would spin<br />\naround, dance to the left, say<br />\n\"'ping' you missed\" then reach<br />\nfor his gun and level you. Once<br />\nhe was sleeping and Jeff sneeked<br />\nup, put his cap gun next to his<br />\nheart and pulled the trigger six<br />\ntimes. The victim lay motionless. When all the bullets were<br />\nout of the cap gun, Paul opened<br />\nhis eyes, slowly reached under<br />\nthe bed for his gun, and said,<br />\n\"ping, ping, ping, ping, ping,<br />\nping, I had on a bullet proof vest,<br />\n'click' bang, you're dead.\"<br />\n\"Let's get back to the colors.\"<br />\n\"Forget it,\" Jeff said, who, by<br />\nthis time had forgotten his<br />\noriginal question about the<br />\ncolors.

Should they be? It is an open<br />\nquestion.<br />\nLet us exhort\u2014hut you must extricate yourself<br />\nfrom political ignorance and impotence. Are there not<br />\nmany things happening in the political arena which<br />\nconcern the future destiny of all at Hopkins? Soon<br />\n(anywhere from three weeks to five years) the fate of<br />\nthe United Nations will be decided: whether it is to be<br />\nmade a more viable organization for international rationality or whether it will meet its demise; whether or<br />\nnot the United tSates will undertake a large war in<br />\nSoutheast Asia, a war in which some of us may have<br />\nto fight. Soon will be decided too whether our country<br />\nwill continue to have a draft, whether our Congress<br />\nwil be rid of inhibitory rules and customs which prevent<br />\nit from discharging its duties. Soon will he decided<br />\nwhat the future portends for the disinherited sections<br />\nin our population\u2014especially the uneducated, unskilled<br />\nyouth.<br />\nWhy exhort yourselves and why exhort others?<br />\nOne basic reason is to be pragmatic. It is to your own<br />\nself-interest to understand what is happening around<br />\nyou, to understand those forces that effect, confine,<br />\nor could ultimately even decide your life. If the determinants of your life are in any degree political (and<br />\nthey are), other participants in this democracy will<br />\naffect you. One must exhort others out of self-interest<br />\n(as we do).<br />\nIs an understanding of determining forces sufficient<br />\nfor self-interest? No, obviously. Forces in society work<br />\nagainst some persons' interests, sometimes even against<br />\nthe interests of the overwhelming majority of the<br />\npeople. The answer to those forces which threaten you<br />\nis counter-force, which means the end of political in:potence. There are, for students, huge roles in many of<br />\nthe controversies in society. All political parties and independent pressure groups need people who share common ideals and who are willing to work to implement<br />\nthose ideals.<br />\nWe are all somewhat threatened, and this \u2022threat<br />\nis somewhat political. Its ramifications must be<br />\nrecognized, an attempt made to understand it.,<br />\nto oppose or aid it, so that we may become active subjects determining our destinies, rather than passive<br />\nobjects to be manipulated or acted upon. We pmsent<br />\nno political point of view except this: that to become<br />\nconscious of the needs of other people is to become conscious of one's self.<br />\n<br />\neaViedilancdeotce<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour editorial bitterly attacking the Junior Instructors at<br />\nHopkins is an unfair indictment.<br />\nIt is very easy to sit back and<br />\ntake pot-shots at many graduates who have been thrust into<br />\na position of authority for the<br />\nfirst time. But one must remember that many of these students<br />\nwould not be able to attend<br />\ngraduate school without the<br />\nfunds provided by this job. It is<br />\nunfortunate that some Junior<br />\nInstructors might get carried<br />\naway with their position and begin to sneer at undergraduates.<br />\nOn the other hand, for every<br />\nJunior Instructor who behaves<br />\nin this immature manner there<br />\nare three or thiur who are devoted to teaching. These people<br />\nare really interested in making<br />\nstudents think and in broadening their experience. The Junior<br />\nInstructor program certainly has<br />\nits defects, but the undergraduates at Hopkins should work<br />\nwith a young teacher and not<br />\nagainst him.

This gives credence to<br />\nthe testimony of the two suspects, who, at the<br />\ntime of their arrests, claimed that the squirrel<br />\nhad not died, but had rather retired to an upper<br />\nbranch of a nearby tree where, it was to be reported, he played possum.

Deschanel, the only member of the<br />\ntrio who had seen the original<br />\n1927 version made by Marionetti (\"Chi Tocca Muore'') stated<br />\nthat the best way to revitalize<br />\nthe story was through the inclusion of football. \"It was in<br />\nfootball that we found the type<br />\nof action, sustained action, that<br />\nkeeps the film moving along,\"<br />\nhe commented.

Perhaps a few critical observations might help avoid the disastrous finalization of certain defects.<br />\nIn a recent incident, one well respected and well<br />\nbehaved undergraduate was attacked by a library employee for sitting in a reading area with his feet supported on an adjacent chair. The student courteously<br />\nacknowledged the reprimand, removed his feet and<br />\nasked, with great civility, what could be the harm in that<br />\nposture, especially considering that he had removed<br />\nhis shoes so as not to soil the chair. His antagonist apparently construed this as the supreme impudence, and<br />\nused the occasion as pretext for the venting of all his<br />\npersonal frustrations. The irritable attendant concluded<br />\nin an officious huff, but returned a little later to instruct another student not to lean on the back of his<br />\nchair. The only reason explicit in his raving concern for<br />\nthe library furniture seems to have been belief that<br />\nthe chair could not withstand the rigors of normal use.<br />\nChairs of subnormal durability and attendants of abnormal volatility are hardly conducive to good study<br />\nor congenial atmosphere.<br /><br />\nPerhaps some provision can he worked out to allow<br />\nchecker a few minutes to himself for lunch in<br />\nbook<br />\nthe<br />\nthe evening. It is somewhat distasteful to be greeted<br />\nby his open lunch box and wax paper sandwiches immediately upon entering that great building. It is, at<br />\nleast, an informality incongruent with the demand that<br />\nstudents keep feet from chairs.

He usually heard everything<br />\nPaul said. Jeff was fond of his<br />\nroommate. You could tell by the<br />\nway he listened to everything he<br />\nsaid. But Paul had this particular 'thing' about Western movies<br />\nthat made him a difficult person<br />\nat times to live with. He had<br />\nseen every western movie and<br />\nlived for the next one. His favorite star was John Wayne and<br />\nhe had a John Wayne gun and<br />\na John Wayne holster t:iat he<br />\noiled all the time. The thing was,<br />\nhe could never be killed. He called his gun X Caliber and Jeff's<br />\nlittle cap gun seemed impotent<br />\nnext to Paul's shiny, big, oiled<br />\nweapon.

He was fast.<br />\nThe real key to Paul was his<br />\nsensitivity to noise or danger.<br />\nJeff would slowly open his desk<br />\ndrawer to get his gun, acting as<br />\nthough he was getting paper or<br />\nink. Over in the corner you<br />\ncould hear a quiet 'clock\"click'.<br />\nPaul never died. There were<br />\ntimes when you could catch him<br />\noff guard\u2014but he would spin<br />\naround, dance to the left, say<br />\n\"'ping' you missed\" then reach<br />\nfor his gun and level you. Once<br />\nhe was sleeping and Jeff sneeked<br />\nup, put his cap gun next to his<br />\nheart and pulled the trigger six<br />\ntimes. The victim lay motionless. When all the bullets were<br />\nout of the cap gun, Paul opened<br />\nhis eyes, slowly reached under<br />\nthe bed for his gun, and said,<br />\n\"ping, ping, ping, ping, ping,<br />\nping, I had on a bullet proof vest,<br />\n'click' bang, you're dead.\"<br />\n\"Let's get back to the colors.\"<br />\n\"Forget it,\" Jeff said, who, by<br />\nthis time had forgotten his<br />\noriginal question about the<br />\ncolors.

Should they be? It is an open<br />\nquestion.<br />\nLet us exhort\u2014hut you must extricate yourself<br />\nfrom political ignorance and impotence. Are there not<br />\nmany things happening in the political arena which<br />\nconcern the future destiny of all at Hopkins? Soon<br />\n(anywhere from three weeks to five years) the fate of<br />\nthe United Nations will be decided: whether it is to be<br />\nmade a more viable organization for international rationality or whether it will meet its demise; whether or<br />\nnot the United tSates will undertake a large war in<br />\nSoutheast Asia, a war in which some of us may have<br />\nto fight. Soon will be decided too whether our country<br />\nwill continue to have a draft, whether our Congress<br />\nwil be rid of inhibitory rules and customs which prevent<br />\nit from discharging its duties. Soon will he decided<br />\nwhat the future portends for the disinherited sections<br />\nin our population\u2014especially the uneducated, unskilled<br />\nyouth.<br />\nWhy exhort yourselves and why exhort others?<br />\nOne basic reason is to be pragmatic. It is to your own<br />\nself-interest to understand what is happening around<br />\nyou, to understand those forces that effect, confine,<br />\nor could ultimately even decide your life. If the determinants of your life are in any degree political (and<br />\nthey are), other participants in this democracy will<br />\naffect you. One must exhort others out of self-interest<br />\n(as we do).<br />\nIs an understanding of determining forces sufficient<br />\nfor self-interest? No, obviously. Forces in society work<br />\nagainst some persons' interests, sometimes even against<br />\nthe interests of the overwhelming majority of the<br />\npeople. The answer to those forces which threaten you<br />\nis counter-force, which means the end of political in:potence. There are, for students, huge roles in many of<br />\nthe controversies in society. All political parties and independent pressure groups need people who share common ideals and who are willing to work to implement<br />\nthose ideals.<br />\nWe are all somewhat threatened, and this \u2022threat<br />\nis somewhat political. Its ramifications must be<br />\nrecognized, an attempt made to understand it.,<br />\nto oppose or aid it, so that we may become active subjects determining our destinies, rather than passive<br />\nobjects to be manipulated or acted upon. We pmsent<br />\nno political point of view except this: that to become<br />\nconscious of the needs of other people is to become conscious of one's self.<br /><br />\neaViedilancdeotce<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour editorial bitterly attacking the Junior Instructors at<br />\nHopkins is an unfair indictment.<br />\nIt is very easy to sit back and<br />\ntake pot-shots at many graduates who have been thrust into<br />\na position of authority for the<br />\nfirst time. But one must remember that many of these students<br />\nwould not be able to attend<br />\ngraduate school without the<br />\nfunds provided by this job. It is<br />\nunfortunate that some Junior<br />\nInstructors might get carried<br />\naway with their position and begin to sneer at undergraduates.<br />\nOn the other hand, for every<br />\nJunior Instructor who behaves<br />\nin this immature manner there<br />\nare three or thiur who are devoted to teaching. These people<br />\nare really interested in making<br />\nstudents think and in broadening their experience. The Junior<br />\nInstructor program certainly has<br />\nits defects, but the undergraduates at Hopkins should work<br />\nwith a young teacher and not<br />\nagainst him.
