FRANK J. GOODNOW<br />\nIn reply to inquiries from many of our Alumni and students I<br />\nventure to outline briefly the plan for the reorganization of the University which I have proposed. In as much as the plan contemplates<br />\nthe withdrawal of the University from its present relations with the<br />\nstate of Maryland, it cannot be adopted until after conference with<br />\nthe state authorities. Such a conference is not possible until the<br />\nAssembly meets in January, 1927. Consequently no plan affecting<br />\nthe relations with the state can be put into action till after that date.<br />\nFurthermore, provision would have to be made for four years of<br />\ncourses of instruction similar to those now given for those students<br />\nwho may wish to enter the University in the fall of 1926. It is thus<br />\nseen that the plan proposed can probably come into complete opera-<br />\n<br />\nGwinn Wins Two<br />\n<br />\nRichard Gwinn led the field to<br />\nthe tape in the mile and two mile<br />\nruns while Ridgely Edwards carried off the honors in the 440 and<br />\n880-yard dashes.

The freshmen, Blades<br />\nand Vivell, took second and third<br />\nin the high jump.<br />\nThe Gobblers were especially<br />\nstrong in the field events, excluding the Blue Jays from a single<br />\nplace in either the discus or the<br />\njavelin throws.<br />\n<br />\nDR.

It may be said in general that a student who has<br />\ngraduated from a Junior College or who has completed two years at<br />\na standard college might expect to be admitted.<br />\n4. The only degrees to be conferred by the Philosophical Faculty would be Master of Arts, for which three years of residence<br />\nwould be required ordinarily, and Doctor of Philosophy, for which<br />\nan additional year at least would be requisite. In the formal statement of the requirements for these degrees proficiency and achievement rather than years of residence would be emphasized.<br />\n5. One concomitant feature of the plan would inevitably be the<br />\nultimate withdrawal of the University from activities in which it is<br />\nnow engaged, but which are not distinctly connected with advanced<br />\nwork.<br />\n6. Changes would be made in the School of Engineering so that<br />\nin effect Engineering would be considered as on the same basis as<br />\nMedicine, Hygiene, and subjects such as Physics, Chemistry or<br />\nBiology.<br />\n7.

FRANK J. GOODNOW<br />\nIn reply to inquiries from many of our Alumni and students I<br />\nventure to outline briefly the plan for the reorganization of the University which I have proposed. In as much as the plan contemplates<br />\nthe withdrawal of the University from its present relations with the<br />\nstate of Maryland, it cannot be adopted until after conference with<br />\nthe state authorities. Such a conference is not possible until the<br />\nAssembly meets in January, 1927. Consequently no plan affecting<br />\nthe relations with the state can be put into action till after that date.<br />\nFurthermore, provision would have to be made for four years of<br />\ncourses of instruction similar to those now given for those students<br />\nwho may wish to enter the University in the fall of 1926. It is thus<br />\nseen that the plan proposed can probably come into complete opera-<br /><br />\nGwinn Wins Two<br /><br />\nRichard Gwinn led the field to<br />\nthe tape in the mile and two mile<br />\nruns while Ridgely Edwards carried off the honors in the 440 and<br />\n880-yard dashes.

The freshmen, Blades<br />\nand Vivell, took second and third<br />\nin the high jump.<br />\nThe Gobblers were especially<br />\nstrong in the field events, excluding the Blue Jays from a single<br />\nplace in either the discus or the<br />\njavelin throws.<br /><br />\nDR.
