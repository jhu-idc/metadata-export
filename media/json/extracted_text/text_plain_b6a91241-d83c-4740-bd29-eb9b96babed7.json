This change is another of these<br />\ndictatorial acts. I am fairly certain that<br />\nthe student body would much prefer to<br />\nhave their vacation during Easter.<br />\nThe administration has stated that the<br />\nreason for this change was to have the<br />\nsecond semester of the year divided into<br />\ntwo equal halves. They have said that<br />\nthis would make the task of teaching a<br />\ncourse easier, as the instructor would not<br />\nhave to revise his schedule to fit the<br />\ncurrent date of Easter. Although I am<br />\ntaking six courses, I must say that in<br />\nnone of these does the date of Easter<br />\nhave any effect upon the teaching of the<br />\ncourse.<br />\nThe administration has also stated that<br />\nsince we finish the scholastic year at a<br />\nvery early date, we should have our<br />\nspring vacation as soon as possible.

He declared that both<br />\nstate and national bank authorities<br />\nhad been too lax in granting licenses to new banks. Accordingly,<br />\nbanks had grown up which possessed no adequate capital or reserves, which were run by inexperienced and dishonest men and<br />\nwhich engaged in speculation and<br />\nunsound banking practices. When<br />\nthe public lost confidence in these<br />\nbanks, and the inevitable runs<br />\nstarted, the majority of such banking institutions could not meet the<br />\ndemands of their depositors and<br />\nfinally, to prevent the failure of<br />\nvast numbers of banks, a holiday<br />\nwas declared.<br />\nFrom this experience, the banker<br />\nsaid, certain things have become<br />\nclear. First, the small \"crossroads\"<br />\nbank must go; second, all banks<br />\nshould be brought under the Federal Reserve System; third, the supervision of these banks must<br />\nbecome more strict. He stated that<br />\nbanks should fulfill only one main<br />\nfunction: that of keeping their depositors' money safe and available;<br />\nand all other activities, especially<br />\nthose of a speculative nature, should<br />\nbe forbidden. Strict reserve requirements should be set up, higher<br />\nthan those today, and banks failing<br />\nto fulfill such requirements should<br />\nbe fined or closed.

A young woman climbs into the box.

One girl curls up<br />\nin the left half of the box with her head and hands<br />\nprotruding, giving the effect you see illustrated<br />\nabove.
