They reminded us<br />\nof the past success of the protest,\" said Keim.<br />\nThe students were loaded onto buses and driven to the protest site. This site was a couple<br />\nblocks away from the South<br />\nAfrican embassy because it is illegal to protest within five hundred feet of an embassy.<br />\nKeim said that the remarkable aspect of the protest was<br />\nthe incredible spirit of those involved. \"It was freezing, cold,<br />\nand windy, but the students remained undaunted in their pro-<br />\n<br />\ntest.\"<br />\nThe students marched with<br />\nsigns across the street from<br />\nother demonstrators on<br />\nMassachusetts Avenue. Keim<br />\nestimated that there were at least<br />\n200-300 people picketing. \"The<br />\nspirit was tremendous,\" continued Keim. \"People driving<br />\nby were honking at the<br />\npicketers and we were given an<br />\novation as we walked by.\"<br />\n\"We listened to speakers and<br />\nthey really helped to inspire the<br />\ngroup,\" said Keim. The<br />\nstudents then took a bus to the<br />\narrest site which was in front of<br />\nthe South African embassy.<br />\nWhile on the bus, the students<br />\nwere interviewed by the<br />\nBaltimore News-American. The<br />\nprotesters were greeted by an<br />\nunusually large number of D.C.<br />\npolicemen. The protesters, singing \"We Shall Overcome,\" remained in front of the embassy<br />\n<br />\nfor over one and a half hours<br />\nbefore they were arrested. \"The<br />\npolice were trying a standoff,\"<br />\nsaid Keim. \"However, I guess<br />\nthe cold and the wind got to<br />\nthem before us. The police were<br />\nsurprised that the protesters<br />\nhad such staying power.\"<br />\nAlthough it was a nervous<br />\nsituation, the majority of the<br />\nprotesters were arrested with<br />\ndignity. \"The situation was<br />\nalways under control. There<br />\nwas no chance of violence,\"<br />\nstated Keim.<br />\nThe entire procedure was extremely organized. Those who<br />\nwished to be arrested wore<br />\nyellow armbands to eliminate<br />\nconfusion among the protesters<br />\nand the police. The men and<br />\nwomen were taken away in<br />\nseparate paddy wagons and to<br />\nseparate cells.

Their hearing is set for<br />\nMarch 14. However, Keim says<br />\nthat charges are usually dropped prior to the hearing. All the<br />\nstudents were headed back for<br />\nBaltimore by 10:00 p.m.<br />\n\"They were a very dedicated,<br />\nvery respectable group of people supporting an unquestionable movement,\" said<br />\nKeim. He also feels that the<br />\ncampus is becoming more active and that the overall<br />\nawareness concerning the problem of apartheid in South<br />\nAfrica has been heightened.<br />\nKeim is strongly opposed to<br />\nHopkins' policy of investing in<br />\ncompanies who have interests<br />\n<br />\nin South Africa. He feels that<br />\na change in South African<br />\npolicies, either violent or<br />\npeaceful, is inevitable. Keim<br />\nfeels, \"It would be good for<br />\nJohns Hopkins to insure a<br />\npeaceful change in South<br />\nAfrica.\" He believes that<br />\nHopkins is making a profit<br />\nfrom the abuse of black people.<br />\nHe compares it to \"doing<br />\nbusiness with pre-World War II<br />\nGermany in the late thirties.\"<br />\nKeim says that this \"tainted<br />\nmoney\" is made from cheap<br />\nlabor and the killing and imprisonment of labor leaders in<br />\nSouth Africa.

The<br />\ntrip yielded a startling major<br />\nfossil discovery\u2014a nearly complete skeleton of Homo erectus.<br />\nWalker, who is a professor<br />\nof cell biology and anatomy at<br />\nthe School of Medicine, spoke<br />\nas part of the Wednesday Noon<br />\nSeries. He began his talk with<br />\na brief summary of previous<br />\nfinds of Homo erectus, a<br />\npredecessor of Homo sapiens.<br />\nAfter Darwin published The<br />\nDescent of Man, German<br />\nzoologist Haeckel anticipated<br />\nthe discovery of Homo erectus<br />\nas the \"missing link\" between<br />\nape and man. Java Man and<br />\nPeking Man were the first major fossils of Homo erectus<br />\nuncovered.<br />\nThe next major finding in<br />\nthis area was the well-publicized<br />\nwork of Dr. L. S. B. Leakey in<br />\nTanzania's Olduvai Gorge in<br />\nthe 1960s. A number of<br />\nvaluable fossils was found by<br />\nanother member of the Leakey<br />\nfamily, Richard Leakey, in the<br />\n1970s at the Koobi Fora site on<br />\nthe eastern shore of Lake<br />\nTurkana in Kenya. Included<br />\namong these was a Homo erectus who had suffered from<br />\nperiostitis, an inflammatory<br />\nbone disease due to an excess of<br />\ndietary vitamin A which is present in high levels in the livers<br />\nof carnivores. This is strong<br />\n<br />\nevidence that man was still<br />\nprimarily a hunter when Homo<br />\nerectus appeared 1.5 to 2<br />\nmillion years ago. However,<br />\nwhile these fossils led many to<br />\npostulate the importance of<br />\nHomo erectus in the course of<br />\nhuman evolution, the evidence<br />\nwas still fragmentary and<br />\ninconclusive.<br />\nDuring August and September of last year, Walker<br />\nworked with Leakey at a site on<br />\nthe western shore of Lake<br />\nTurkana near the Sudanese<br />\nborder. A section of jawbone<br />\nwas found and led to an exploration of the site which<br />\nyielded a nearly complete skull<br />\nwhich was pieced together from<br />\nover 70 fragments. Further excavation resulted in the<br />\ndiscovery of a nearly complete<br />\nHomo erectus skeleton scattered throughout sedimentary<br />\nparticles in the remnants of a<br />\nprehistoric swamp. Based on<br />\nthe dental eruption and growth<br />\nplates on bones, the specimen<br />\nwas determined to be about 12<br />\nyears of age in modern human<br />\nterms. The prehistoric pre-teen<br />\nwas identified as a male by the<br />\nstructure of the pelvic bone and<br />\ngeochemical dating techniques<br />\nshow that the fossils are 1.6<br />\nmillion years old. The bone<br />\nstructure clearly shows that the<br />\nboy was well over six feet and<br />\na review of fragments of other<br />\nHomo erectus fossils showed<br />\nthat man has been getting<br />\nsmaller in stature as evolution<br />\ncontinues.<br />\nWhen juxtaposed with<br />\n<br />\nNeanderthal Man, some in- similarities which are not seen<br />\ntriguing revelations are made in a comparison with an adult<br />\nconcerning man's evolution ap- Homo erectus.<br />\nproximately two million years<br />\nMuch information was also<br />\nago.

Plain and simple:<br />\nfrats aren't all bad. Nationwide, fraternities often post<br />\nhigher G.P.A.'s than the student body as a whole. At<br />\nHopkins, frats make up a great<br />\nportion of the work needed for<br />\nSpring Fair; everything from<br />\nmanning the booths to assisting<br />\nsecurity. Alumni who were<br />\nmembers of fraternities are<br />\nmore likely to be involved in<br />\nfundraising and other activities.<br />\nFinally, the frats supply a needed injection of enthusiasm into<br />\nthe Hopkins social scene. For<br />\nyears they have provided the<br />\nstudents with the best environment to meet and talk with<br />\n\"An area major lets an undergraduate stu- undergraduates themselves are being exclud- comrades who still maintain<br />\ndent plan an interdisciplinary program that ed from formal membership on these there is life after D-level.

Such action is<br />\nnecessary to maintain the academic integrity of the major and to provide guidance for<br />\nthose students who wish to take advantage<br />\nof its flexibility. It is annoying, however, that<br />\n<br />\nmajor fields of study after several years here.<br />\nThey, perhaps more than anyone else, realize<br />\nwhat changes are needed since they are now<br />\npreparing to face the consequences of their<br />\nown academic concentrations. Underclassmen may likewise have constructive suggestions. To disregard such information or to<br />\nexclude it from formal deliberation seems<br />\nsenseless and the approach should be<br />\nreconsidered.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nMore on Fraternities<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nMr. Warren's article of last<br />\nweek concerning the history of<br />\nfraternities at Johns Hopkins illuminates many of the problems that exist within the<br />\nfraternities and their relationship with the university. By<br />\ncomparing the student involvement (and behavior) of today,<br />\none might predict a general<br />\ndecline for these social<br />\norganizations with a forseeable<br />\nconclusion. But that rationalization would be based on<br />\na few well-publicized events and<br />\nnot include the overall change<br />\nin the fraternities that has occurred over the past few years.<br />\nTo be more precise, this past<br />\nyear every fraternity has taken<br />\nextraordinary measures (in<br />\ncomparison to past measures)<br />\nto cooperate with the university and neighbors. This fall the<br />\nInter-Fraternity Council, after<br />\nconsulting with the university,<br />\npassed a resolution on \"Open<br />\nParty Policy,\" dramatically<br />\ncurbing problems that accompanied these events. New<br />\nrestrictions were enforced on<br />\nactivity outside the houses: the<br />\nnumber of kegs allowed, the<br />\ntime parties were to break up,<br />\netc. Fraternities also tried to improve their image by sponsoring athletic and relay games<br />\nduring a \"Greek Weekend.\"<br />\n<br />\nWhile this event received little<br />\npublicity, it was an effort by the<br />\nI.F.C. to show that frats were<br />\nnot just \"the party.\" Most<br />\nrecently, the I.F.C. \"dried out<br />\nRush,\" for all intents and purposes, by recommending fines<br />\nfor fraternities that the university and I.F.C. felt had violated<br />\nRush policies. (This was an inevitable event that has ocurred<br />\nat most colleges where the state<br />\ndrinking age has risen.) This<br />\nlatest action demonstrates the<br />\nfraternities' collective will to<br />\npolice themselves and to conform to the prevailing attitudes<br />\nof the university and the nation<br />\nin regards to alcohol. A letter<br />\nthat appeared in the NewsLetter two weeks ago commented on the alterations in the<br />\nfraternity parties in just the past<br />\nfew years. It should be clear to<br />\nthe university and students that<br />\nfrats have drastically cleaned up<br />\ntheir act in the past few years.<br />\nEven with all the changes<br />\nthat fraternities have implemented, does this mean the<br />\nbrothers have acquired halos<br />\nand do only good deeds? Certainly not. Fraternities must<br />\nunderstand what has brought<br />\ndown the weight of the administration, neighbors, and<br />\nevery anti-alcohol interest on<br />\ntheir shoulders. The drinking<br />\nlaw changed and frats didn't.<br />\nWe kept on throwing open<br />\nparties\u2014calmer than their wild<br />\npredecessors of the 1970's\u2014yet,<br />\n<br />\n\"open\" nonetheless. The<br />\nuniversity could not help but<br />\nraise an eyebrow when young<br />\nstudents staggered into the<br />\ndorms with tales of drunkeness<br />\nand debauchery in smoke-filled<br />\nrooms. Each tale was exaggerated and amplified until the<br />\nadministration was presented a<br />\npicture of Hopkins fraternities<br />\nas being the source of evil in the<br />\nmodern world.<br />\nWhat,then, is the answer for<br />\nfrats? The answer is mellow-out<br />\nthe parties. We need only to<br />\nlook into our own histories to<br />\nfind the answer to our recent<br />\nproblems. Prior to 1973, the<br />\ndrinking age in Maryland was<br />\n21. According to alumni, parties occurred\u2014but were usually closed, well-tempered,<br />\ndiscrete affairs. Because of the<br />\nfraternities' self-imposed<br />\nrestraint, the university saw no<br />\nneed to intervene. (Given this,<br />\nthe university's current charge<br />\nof underage serving at fraternities is somewhat unfair.)<br />\nHopkins fraternities should<br />\ntake a lesson from the alumni<br />\nand exercise much more discretion at parties, probably making them invitation events.<br />\nFraternities must change with<br />\nthe growing tide and recognize<br />\ntheir responsibilities to the community and the university.

I hope you enjoy it<br />\nmore than I have.<br />\n1. Dinner<br />\nRight after graduation<br />\neverybody goes out to dinner<br />\nwith their families. But since<br />\nmy sister and brother-in-law<br />\nshowed up at the last minute<br />\nwith their kid, there wasn't<br />\nenough room for everyone in<br />\nthe car. So I stayed, and they<br />\nall went out to eat. No kidding,<br />\nI really did. I ended up eating<br />\nhalf a pizza over at P.J.'s.<br />\nwhich wasn't so bad at all considering I found out later about<br />\nthe scene my dad made at the<br />\nrestaurant where they went. He<br />\ndidn't have reservations, so he<br />\ntold the hostess he had tuberculosis. Then he pretty much<br />\nhad his pick of tables.<br />\n2. Lacrosse finals<br />\nI locked my keys in my car,<br />\nand a couple guys from<br />\nSyracuse offered to give me a<br />\nhand getting them out, which I<br />\nfigured was pretty nice since<br />\ntheir team had just lost the<br />\nchampionship. It would've<br />\nbeen even nicer if they'd explained to me beforehand that<br />\nthey were going to use large<br />\nrocks to do it. Anyway, they<br />\ngot the keys out, and I probably<br />\nended up saving a ton of money<br />\nbecause I didn't have to use the<br />\nair-conditioner all summer.<br />\n3. Work<br />\nThis gigantic company gave<br />\nme a job for the summer. I<br />\nwould tell you what I did, but<br />\neven now I'm not quite sure.<br />\nThey sure did give me a lot of<br />\nmoney for doing it, though.<br />\n<br />\n4. Movies<br />\nI saw a bunch of movies<br />\nbecause I had so much money<br />\nfrom working for this gigantic<br />\ncompany. Anyway, I saw this<br />\none really terrific one. I don't<br />\nremember the name of it. Or<br />\nwho was in it. Or what it was<br />\nabout. But you should see it if<br />\nyou have a chance. You really<br />\nshould.<br />\n5. Weddings<br />\nPractically everybody I know<br />\ngot married right after graduation, so I ended up having to,<br />\nbuy a million wine decanters. I<br />\nhave no idea at all what you're<br />\nsupposed to do with them. I<br />\nmean, I know you're supposed<br />\nto use them for wine, but<br />\neveryone I know drinks wine<br />\nright out of the bottle. Maybe<br />\nyou're supposed to pour it in<br />\nthis first. Who knows?<br />\nAnyway, my mom said I should<br />\nbuy them, and she knows about<br />\nthese things since most of her<br />\nfriends have been married halfa-dozen times each.<br />\n\u2022 6. Weird<br />\nI think I started missing all of<br />\nmy friends from Hopkins too<br />\nmuch because all of a sudden<br />\nmy mind just went berserk on<br />\nme, and I started thinking these<br />\nreally weird things. Like, what<br />\nif chocolate were poisonous. I'd<br />\nbet people wouldn't eat so<br />\nmuch of it then. Have you ever<br />\nthought of that? Well, it's true.<br />\n7. More weddings<br />\nThis girl I used to date got<br />\nmarried, which put me in a rotten mood. So I found out what<br />\nhotel they were staying in on<br />\ntheir wedding night and kept<br />\ncalling up to say that there was<br />\na bomb in one of the rooms. I<br />\nknow that's probably illegal or<br />\nsomething, but I really got a<br />\nkick out of it.<br />\n8. Clothes<br />\nI still had a lot of money<br />\nfrom working for that gigantic<br />\ncompany, so I bought all of<br />\nthese super clothes. The only<br />\nproblem was that they looked<br />\nbetter on those mannequins<br />\nthan on me. Like this Indiana<br />\n<br />\nJones hat I bought, for instance, makes me look more<br />\nlike Don Knotts than Indiana<br />\nJones. I would've taken it back<br />\nexcept that girls really like the<br />\nway Don Knotts looks. Really.<br />\nMy sister told me that.<br />\n9. Law school<br />\nI went to law school. For<br />\nthree weeks. I'd really rather<br />\nnot talk about this except to<br />\nmake it clear that I did not get<br />\nthrown out like everyone thinks<br />\nI did. I mean, the only way you<br />\ncould possibly get thrown out<br />\nof law school after three weeks<br />\nwould be if you failed orientation, which 1 didn't. I swear.<br />\nYou could ask the dean.<br />\n10. Writing<br />\nI decided to combine my<br />\npolitical science background<br />\nwith my love of fiction and<br />\ncame up with some great<br />\nstories. Tell me what you think<br />\nof these: \"Rasputin Goes to<br />\nBaskin-Robbins,\" \"William<br />\nthe Conqueror Coaches a Little League Baseball Team,\"<br />\n\"George S. Patton Bakes a<br />\nSeven-Layer Cake,\" and<br />\n\"Lord Mountbatten Eats a<br />\nLive German Shepherd.\"<br />\nDon't expect to see any of these<br />\nin print though\u2014it looks like<br />\nThe New Yorker has this thing<br />\nabout not printing young<br />\nwriters. What a bunch of jerks.<br />\n11. Joke<br />\nA friend told me a good<br />\njoke. It's hilarious, and I'm<br />\npractically falling out of my<br />\nchair just thinking about it. Remind me to tell you sometime.<br />\n12. Money<br />\nI spent all of the money I'd<br />\nmade from that gigantic company, so I had to start borrowing from friends and selling<br />\nthings just to get by. I even sold<br />\na station wagon for $500, which<br />\nwas a pretty good deal since it<br />\nbelonged to our next-door<br />\nneighbors, the Kaels, who were<br />\nat Great Adventure for the day.<br />\nI could've gotten $1000 for it if<br />\nI wanted to haggle, but I<br />\nfigured why be a jerk.<br />\n<br />\nFred factorial<br />\nThetrilic s-tori of a malt<br />\n40 must come Az -terms wiih<br />\net-notional and Fhpical toriure<br />\ndurint3 one oF history's clarkesi60-5...

Then I go<br />\nhome and write a letter and<br />\napologize for it.<br />\n14. Work<br />\nI got another job writing,<br />\nwhich is a good job because my<br />\neditor's cute. She's got blonde<br />\nhair, and she's 28, and the best<br />\npart about the whole thing is<br />\nthat she thinks I'm 28, too.<br />\nThat's pretty funny if you ask<br />\nme because there's no way in<br />\nthe world I even look like I'm<br />\n15. Anyway, I tricked her intothinking I'm 28, and now she<br />\nlets me wash her car and do her<br />\nlaundry and everything.<br />\n15. Hospital<br />\nThe police finally tracked<br />\ndown our next-door neighbors'<br />\ncar in Minnesota and they<br />\n<br />\nfound out all about how I sold<br />\nit. So Mr. Kael came over and<br />\nchased me all around our house<br />\nwith his Toro weed-and-garden<br />\ntrimmer.

This investment<br />\ncan, however, be paid off by<br />\nthe quality of the education and<br />\nthe opportunities afforded by<br />\nattending such a school.

He says that the<br />\nU.S. technological lead is imperative to national security.<br />\nHow does he expect that lead to<br />\nbe maintained if he cuts aid to<br />\nstudents that get higher quality<br />\neducations and exposure to<br />\ncomplex ideas and high<br />\ntechnology? Is the nation more<br />\nsecure in having twenty more<br />\nMX missiles to add to our<br />\nstockpiles, or in advancing the<br />\neducation of this nation's<br />\nchildren? Reagan seems to<br />\nprefer the missiles; after all,<br />\nthey are in the budget.<br />\nIf this budget passes, educational opportunities for the<br />\nmiddle and working classes will<br />\nbecome severely limited.

First of all, this is the<br />\n<br />\nfirst time (I think) that every<br />\nsenior was given a letter requesting nominations for Student Activities Awards(formerly known as SAC seals). This<br />\nwas done to give everyone in<br />\nthe class an opportunity to have<br />\nsome say in who is chosen for<br />\nthese awards.<br />\nThis process was worked out<br />\nbetween the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard and myself, representing<br />\nthe Senior Class. Much of it<br />\ndepends upon mutual understanding by the two parties, but<br />\non the whole, it is structured<br />\nmuch better that it has been in<br />\nthe past.<br />\nMy real gripe is towards the<br />\nSenior Class, itself. The boxes<br />\nwere stuffed on Feb. 1st, and<br />\nnow, two weeks later, we have<br />\nnext to nothing in the way of<br />\nnominations. Come on Seniors,<br />\nlet's get with it! By opening the<br />\nawards process up to the<br />\ngeneral public, it was meant to<br />\ninclude everyone who is interested, instead of a<br />\nmysterious decision-making<br />\nprocess in some dark, smokefilled room. If this response<br />\nreflects the true feelings of the<br />\nclass, namely apathy, then there<br />\nis no reason to bother giving<br />\nout awards.<br />\nThere are five more days to<br />\nnominate people for all awards.<br />\nWe need input, now, people!!<br />\nIf there is disastrously inadequate participation, then there<br />\nare two choices: either return<br />\nthe process to dark, smokefilled rooms or get rid of<br />\nawards altogether.

Just last September<br />\nHopkins threw an extravagant<br />\nparty on campus for its rich<br />\nalumni and benefactors, kicking off the largest fund-raising<br />\ndrive in the history of higher<br />\neducation, with a stated goal of<br />\nfour hundred and fifty million<br />\ndollars in the next five years.<br />\nThis tuition increase is disturbing because it makes perfectly plain (to anyone who might<br />\nhave missed the message in last<br />\nyear's thousand-dollar, thirteen-percent increase) that the<br />\nHopkins administration is more<br />\ninterested in prestige than in<br />\nkeeping a Hopkins education<br />\naccessible to those who deserve<br />\nit.

Hansen<br />\nGlobal Tuition Race<br />\nTo the Edi;or:<br />\nLast week saw another<br />\ndangerous escalation in the<br />\nglobal tuition race as Johns<br />\nHopkins President Steven<br />\nMuller proposed an $800 tuition hike, bringing the yearly<br />\nJHU total to $14,160. This was<br />\napparently in response to the<br />\nincrease announced by Yale the<br />\nweek before, and it has sparked Brown's $1,100 rise to<br />\n$15,000.<br />\nThese actions violate the<br />\n1972 Tuition Limitation Treaty (TILT) and virtually<br />\neliminate any hope for a<br />\nresumption of the stalled Tui-<br />\n<br />\ntion Reduction Talks (TORT)<br />\nin Duluth.<br />\nIt is clear that these universities no longer believe that tuition reduction is possible, and<br />\nso they have decided to maintain the policy of Mutually<br />\nAssured Money (MAM). This<br />\ncan only hasten the spiral down<br />\nto global disintegration. At<br />\nleast thirty universities in the<br />\nUnited States alone now have<br />\nthe tuition to buy the world<br />\nseveral times over. And yet,<br />\nthey continue to increase their<br />\ndemands, all in the name of<br />\n\"academic readiness\" and<br />\n\"career security.\" According to<br />\nVice-President George Bush,<br />\nacademic readiness is \"way,<br />\nway up,\" from the late '70's,<br />\nand career security \"has never<br />\nbeen better.\"<br />\nBut they still ask for more<br />\nmoney.

Between the hours of 6:00 p.m.<br />\nand 2:00 a.m., 7 days a week,<br />\nthere will be monitors stationed in both the freshman and<br />\nGilman quads. Their main purpose is to make sure all is quiet<br />\nin the quads. However, these<br />\nmonitors are also open to give<br />\nfoot escorts around campus or<br />\njust off Charles Street. During<br />\nthe end of night school classes<br />\n(7:45-8:15 p.m.), one of the<br />\nmonitors moves to the lower<br />\nDavid Chen, '87 quad to aid people leaving<br />\n<br />\nclass.<br />\nEach monitor carries a<br />\nwalkie-talkie (the same ones<br />\ncarried by security), so if a<br />\nmonitor sees or experiences<br />\ntrouble, he is able to call security for immediate help. To request a foot escort, just ask one<br />\nof the monitors (we should<br />\nhave orange vests soon to make<br />\nus more visible) or call security.<br />\nDeserving the credit for this<br />\nidea is Student Council's<br />\nBuldings and Grounds Committee, and JHU Security. Being a member of B & G Committee, it was my job to<br />\norganize the monitors and<br />\nmake sure operations run as<br />\nsmoothly in the future as they<br />\nhave in the past.

Hayward; New<br />\nScience Library/Shambhala;<br />\n323 PP; $9.95<br />\n<br />\nExcerpt<br />\n\"The history of science is the<br />\nhistory of continual revelation<br />\nof partial truths which have<br />\noften been clung to as the<br />\nwhole or the absolute truth.<br />\nNowadays these partial truths<br />\nare, indeed, often themselves<br />\ncreated by science. Nevertheless, the role of science<br />\nseems to lie far more in its<br />\ndisclosure of partiality than in<br />\nany steady progress toward<br />\nsome supposed \"truth.\" If we<br />\ntake the insights of science<br />\npersonally, it, too, can throw<br />\nlight on the beliefs that con-<br />\n<br />\nMan's perception of the<br />\nworld is biased by his customs<br />\nand beliefs.

He is able to do this on<br />\none level, but fails at the higher<br />\nlevels of philosophy for which<br />\nthink of words and language as<br />\nthe book is written.<br />\nHayward uses the teachings reality rather than just a<br />\nof Shambhala (notice the representation of it.

From Close To Nature.<br />\n<br />\nOkay, people, you've read<br />\nevery book the book column<br />\nhas had to offer you for the<br />\npast few months. Your erudition on today's books is startling; you impress your friends<br />\nand those all-important<br />\nmembers of the opposite sex.<br />\nNow, though, you want something for a one-night read (I<br />\nknow how sleazy you feel<br />\nafter one-night reads, but it's<br />\npart of being a liberated<br />\nreader). Well, do I have a<br />\nbook for you. Nightbloom is<br />\nsome of the best mental<br />\nmasturbation I've read in a<br />\ngood long time.<br />\nNightbloom 's plot is fairly<br />\nstandard, with a slovenly cop,<br />\na depraved killer, and a weir-<br />\n<br />\non forever and repeat themselves often. He raises the old<br />\nphilosophical questions of life,<br />\nthe mind and reality; and<br />\nanswers in ways that are not entirely new.<br />\nAll in all, however, Perceiving Ordinary Magic makes<br />\ngood reading for the scientifically minded. It should be<br />\nread for the questions it raises<br />\nabout our beliefs in science, if<br />\nnot for the solutions it advocates. The book forces the<br />\nreader to look at old ideas in<br />\nnew ways. That is something<br />\nany true scientist should be doing at all times.<br />\ndo who holds the key to the<br />\ncase. The writing is standard<br />\npaperback fare, and the<br />\ncharacterization is entertaining, but unexceptional. So<br />\nwhat, you may ask, is so good<br />\nabout this book? The answer<br />\nis simple; if Mr. Lieberman<br />\nisn't going to make anyone<br />\nforget Hemingway, he's still<br />\nan exceptionally good psychosuspense writer who touches<br />\nevery base. Every character in<br />\nthis book is just enough off<br />\nhis/her rocker to make it interesting without being so<br />\ncrazy<br />\nthat<br />\nthey're<br />\nunbelievable. Every action in<br />\nthis book is just extraordinary<br />\nenough to make sure you<br />\ndon't think you're reading the<br />\nnewspaper, but you're left<br />\nthinking that you may read<br />\nabout this tomorrow; that, my<br />\ndear reader, is a rare talent.<br />\nSo go ahead, fail that exam.<br />\nHand in that paper that you<br />\njust know is going to be laughed out of the grading system.<br />\nThis book just beckons you<br />\nwith smooth, easy paragraphs<br />\nand looks deep in your eyes<br />\nwith all-around good stuff. So<br />\nfeel free; treat yourself; just<br />\nhave a good time and curl up<br />\nwith some easy reading.

Diane<br />\nKeaton does fine work as the title character, the wife of a<br />\nprison warden who falls in love<br />\nwith one of the convicts. As<br />\nJack Biddle, Mel Gibson is<br />\nequally effective as the powerful, sexy prisoner who frees<br />\nKate Soffel from her straightlaced, schoolmarm persona.<br />\nBut the story itself, while told<br />\nextremely well, is flawed all the<br />\nsame.<br />\nMatthew<br />\nGibson and<br />\nModine, who plays Jack's<br />\nbrother and partner in crime,<br />\nhave been placed on death row<br />\nfor the murder of a shopkeeper<br />\nin 1901 Pittsburgh. It is behind<br />\nbars that the brothers encounter<br />\nKeaton. As Mrs. Soffel, Keaton<br />\nhas recently recovered from a<br />\nthree-month illness which imposed an equally long sexual<br />\nisolation from her husband (an<br />\nisolation which she chooses to<br />\ncontinue after the illness subsides). Healthy again, she has<br />\nresumed the task of spreading<br />\nbibles and religion amongst her<br />\nhusband's prisoners.<br />\nThe young ladies of Pittsburgh are under the spell of<br />\nGibson's sexual magnetism as<br />\nthey gather outside the prison<br />\nto protest and lament his imminent hanging. Keaton, displaying a pronounced middleagedness, is similarly attracted<br />\nto the younger, wild Gibson.<br />\nUsing this fact to his advantage,<br />\nGibson has Keaton smuggle<br />\nsaw blades to him and his<br />\nbrother to cut the cell bars, her<br />\nbible the means by which the<br />\n<br />\nso<br />\nAl<br />\nwl<br />\nmi<br />\nthi<br />\ntu<br />\nch<br />\nrel<br />\nati<br />\n<br />\nas<br />\ned<br />\nan<br />\nfai<br />\nin<br />\nth<br />\n<br />\nUn<br />\nSt(<br />\nM<br />\n<br />\ndc<br />\n<br />\nmi<br />\n<br />\nBi<br />\nis<br />\nsa<br />\nw(<br />\nsh<br />\nsy<br />\nbr<br />\nhy<br />\nhe<br />\nth,<br />\ntal<br />\n<br />\nth,<br />\ndu<br />\nNv(<br />\nin<br />\nJa<br />\nsh<br />\nhi;<br />\n<br />\n'Nen<br />\n<br />\n:Et)<br />\n<br />\nRE<br />\nIAL<br />\n<br />\nPress Photo<br />\n<br />\nblades are brought to and from<br />\nthe prison.

To her credit, director<br />\nArmstrong does not overplay<br />\nthe happy banter. For all the<br />\njokes, the Biddies never seem to<br />\nlose sight of their destiny.<br />\nAmong Kate Soffel's family<br />\nare two daughters, each<br />\nrepresenting a distinct side of<br />\ntheir mother's personality: the<br />\nolder, pragmatic daughter,<br />\nwho, like mother, will be married by age seventeen, and the<br />\n<br />\nyounger daughter, who speaks<br />\nof the devil taking over her soul<br />\nand is obsessed with the Biddies' case. Kate formally rejects<br />\nthe older child the day of the<br />\nprison break, the day Kate<br />\nleaves her husband to escape<br />\nwith Jack. And when the film's<br />\nsad ending finally arrives, it is<br />\nthe older daughter who is the<br />\nfirst to welcome her mother<br />\nback to reality.<br />\nMrs. Soffel never successfully captures the 1901 feel<br />\nfor which it should be striving.<br />\nWhile the sets do look perfect,<br />\nand the acting as well, a<br />\nnumber of the camera angles<br />\nseem a bit too \"current\" for the<br />\nContinued on Page 19<br />\n<br />\noiski<br />\n<br />\n\f-<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br />\n<br />\nKeaton and Gibson Star Record Reviews<br />\nby Tom Ferraro<br />\nContinued from Page 18<br />\n<br />\nscenes being photographed.<br />\nAlso, Mark Isham's score,<br />\nwhile effective, often has too<br />\nmodern a feel to it. But these<br />\nthings detract little from the actual story Ms. Armstrong<br />\nchooses to tell, and succeeds in<br />\nrelating in an emotion-packed<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nMrs. Soffel is advertised<br />\nas a true story. We are reminded of this in the opening credits,<br />\nand Ms. Armstrong has gone so<br />\nfar as to shoot the prison scenes<br />\nin the Allegheny County Jail,<br />\nthe place the story originally<br />\nunfolded. Unfortunately the<br />\nstory, as presented, never seems<br />\nmore than \"only a story;\" it<br />\ndoes not ring true.<br />\nWhether the brothers are<br />\nmurderers is what the film calls<br />\ninto question, not whether the<br />\nRiddles are criminals; the latter<br />\nLS established as fact. All the<br />\nsame, it is a fact Armstrong<br />\nwould prefer we overlook as<br />\nshe presents an astonishingly<br />\nsYmpathetic picture of the<br />\nbrothers. Jack never seems as<br />\nhypocritical as he must be when<br />\nhe initiates a relationship with<br />\nthe warden's wife. Armstrong<br />\ntakes great pains to show the<br />\nmistreatment of the Biddies by<br />\nthe prison guards and how,<br />\nduring the escape, the guards<br />\nwere done no form of serious<br />\nInjury.

This sounds like<br />\nthe generic music you hear on<br />\nTV shows when they go to<br />\ndance clubs (especially on The<br />\nLove Boat). One song reaches<br />\nabout the pace of a TV chase<br />\nscene but the rest fall very flat.<br />\nThese people obviously haven't<br />\nbeen down on the street and<br />\nlistening for a long time. Also<br />\nthe music publishing company<br />\nis Skratch, but don't expect to<br />\nhear any scratching. What a<br />\nletdown-2.<br />\nSpeaking of dancing, I was<br />\ndrawn in by all those ads in the<br />\nCity Paper for Cignel, a new<br />\ndance club on East Lafayette<br />\n(around the corner from the<br />\nCharles Theatre). I got there<br />\naround 12, which I knew was<br />\nearly, but I figured since it closed at 4:00 a.m., what the heck.<br />\nAnyway, about fifteen other<br />\npeople and I waited around until 1:30 when the action started<br />\nto pick up. At least it gave me<br />\na chance to check the place out.<br />\nIt's very new, and the layout is<br />\nplanned well: loud music in the<br />\ndance floor area, lower volume<br />\nin the bar and lounge areas.<br />\nThe music selection was<br />\n<br />\nreasonable, but the same DJ<br />\nisn't there every week, so who<br />\nknows. The one when I was<br />\nthere (Jeremy) suffered from<br />\nthat dreaded disease which I<br />\nwill dub \"club dj-itis\": you<br />\nknow when the bass is real<br />\nhigh, since you can feel your<br />\nchest vibrate. All that doesn't<br />\nmatter when you're out on the<br />\ndance floor, and the music was<br />\nvery danceable.<br />\nOne drawback was the lack<br />\nof light in the dance floor area.<br />\nI like to see what I'm getting into when I ask someone to<br />\ndance. Also, don't worry about<br />\nbeing proofed, kiddies, because<br />\nthey don't have a liquor license.<br />\nBut if you ask nicely, they<br />\nmight give you some champagne punch which they keep<br />\nunder the counter. And check<br />\nout the bad art (at least the<br />\nweek I was there) on the walls<br />\n(all for sale). It's only open<br />\nFridays, so if you don't mind<br />\ndancing alone, go early for<br />\nyour best dancing dollar<br />\nbargain (five bucks admission)<br />\nhave a few at Club Charles, and<br />\ndance the night away.<br />\nAnd for a special treat, when<br />\nthe long-lamented WJHU<br />\ncomes back on the air, listen<br />\nTuesday morning 3-6 a.m. for<br />\nthe aural equivalent of this<br />\ncolumn.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/21<br />\n<br />\nScience<br />\nAmniocentesis Yields Early Sickle Cell Detection<br />\nby Robin Gugenheim<br />\n<br />\nThe field of prenatal<br />\ndiagnosis has grown in recent<br />\nyears into an exciting and<br />\ndiverse science. The recent advances are a result of applying<br />\nrecombinant DNA techniques<br />\nto the various problems of<br />\nclinical medicine and genetics.<br />\nHaig Kazazian Jr., M.D.,<br />\nDirector of the Genetics Unit in<br />\nthe Department of Pediatrics at<br />\nHopkins, began his research<br />\nwith hemoglobinopathies,<br />\nvarious disorders of the red<br />\nblood cell protein hemoglobin,<br />\naround 1970. Kazazian, along<br />\nwith Stylianos E. Antonarakis,<br />\nM.D., Alan Scott, Ph.D., and<br />\nCorinne D. Boehm, M.S., are<br />\npresently studying DNA from<br />\nfamilies where sickle cell<br />\nanemia, beta-thalassemia, other<br />\nhemoglobinopathies, and<br />\nhemophilia traits are present.<br />\nWhen prenatal diagnosis<br />\nbegan in 1970 not much was<br />\nknown about this intriguing<br />\nfield. Researchers discovered<br />\nthat the beta-globin chain of<br />\nhemoglobin, that would be affected in sickle-cell anemia and<br />\nbeta-thalassemia, two genetic<br />\ndisorders, is produced in early<br />\nfetal life. Therefore, it would be<br />\nbiologically possible to carry<br />\n<br />\nout prenatal detection of these<br />\ndiseases if one could get a fetal<br />\nblood sample. This analysis<br />\ndepended upon the actual protein product, beta-hemoglobin,<br />\nof the beta-globin gene.<br />\nHobbins and Mahoney at<br />\nYale, and other groups around<br />\nthe world, started developing<br />\nfetoscopy around 1975, which<br />\nis used to obtain fetal blood<br />\nsamples. This procedure,<br />\nalthough highly successful, carries a risk of about 3 to 4 percent fatality depending upon<br />\nthe skill of the obstetrician.<br />\nThis test entails putting a<br />\nfiberoptic scope, with a light<br />\nsource, through the abdominal<br />\nwall, through the uterus, and<br />\ninto the amniotic sac. The field<br />\nof vision is very small, such<br />\nthat, when looking at the extremities, only a part of the<br />\nfetus's hand can be observed at<br />\none time. Blood is then taken<br />\nfrom a placental vein on the inner surface near the fetus.<br />\nY.W. Kan in San Francisco did<br />\nthe first procedures for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia and<br />\nbeta-thalasSemia in 1975-6.<br />\nSickle cell anemia and betathalassemia are two genetic<br />\ndisorders where the beta-globin<br />\nchain of hemoglobin carries a<br />\nmutation that alters its chemical<br />\nstructure. Sickle cell anemia can<br />\n<br />\nbe deadly although about half<br />\nof its victims live to 35 or 40<br />\nyears of age. The red blood<br />\ncells of afflicted individuals exhibit the characteristic sickle<br />\nshape that inspired the name of<br />\nthe disease. Carriers, who only<br />\npossess one affected gene, exhibit a moderate sickling of<br />\ntheir red blood cells. Betathalassemia, a much more<br />\nsevere disease, results from a<br />\nmutation in a single nucleotide<br />\nbase or a deletion of a particular region of the beta-globin<br />\ngene. These patients must be<br />\ntreated with frequent blood<br />\ntransfusions, but the resulting<br />\naccumulation of iron causes<br />\npremature death for most<br />\npatients.<br />\nThe use of recombinant<br />\nDNA technology in 1978 was a<br />\nmajor breakthrough for<br />\nprenatal<br />\ndiagnosis<br />\nof<br />\nhemoglobinopathies. By using<br />\nthe technique of Southern Blot<br />\nAnalysis one could look at the<br />\nbeta-globin gene itself. This<br />\nmeans that the hemoglobin<br />\nmolecule isn't needed and<br />\ntherefore, any cell from the<br />\nbody may be used for analysis,<br />\nnot just red blood cells. The<br />\nDNA could be obtained by the<br />\nknown<br />\nas<br />\nprocedure<br />\namniocentesis.<br />\nThe Southern Blot Analysis<br />\n<br />\nPOP<br />\n<br />\nBalloons Used to Treat Arteries<br />\nWider use of the balloon inflation technique instead of<br />\nbypass surgery to treat narrowed or obstructed arteries in the<br />\nleg offers the potential for<br />\nsubstantial cost savings without<br />\nsacrificing good patient care,<br />\naccording to investigators at the<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions.<br />\n\"While overutilization of<br />\ndiagnostic radiology has been a<br />\npopular theme to explain increasing medical costs,<br />\nunderutilization of interventional radiology procedures,<br />\nsuch as the balloon technique,<br />\nalso are a factor in rising<br />\ncosts,\" they say.<br />\nIn a group of 86 patients<br />\ntreated at Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nthe length of stay averaged 4 to<br />\n4.5 times longer, and the total<br />\nhospital charge was 3 to 3.7<br />\ntimes greater for the surgical<br />\nbypass group than for the<br />\ngroup treated with the balloon<br />\ntechnique\u2014percutaneous<br />\ntransluminal angioplasty<br />\n(PTA).<br />\nThe findings were presented<br />\nat the recent Radiological<br />\nSociety of North America<br />\nmeeting in Washington, D.C.,<br />\nby a team led by Malonnie L.<br />\nKinnison, M.D., assistant professor of radiology.<br />\nThe investigators analyzed<br />\ncosts in treating diseased portions of the femoral artery,<br />\nwhich extends from just below<br />\nthe hip to the knee, and the iliac artery, which extends from<br />\nthe navel to the crease at the top<br />\nof the leg.<br />\nWhen these arteries become<br />\nblocked by atherosclerotic plaque, surgeons traditionally have<br />\ncorrected the problem by<br />\n<br />\nremoving a vein from some<br />\nother area of the body and grafting it to the artery above and<br />\nbelow the blockage\u2014thereby<br />\n\"bypassing\" the trouble spot.<br />\nIn PTA, interventional<br />\nradiologists thread a catheter<br />\nwith a balloon tip into the<br />\nobstructed segment of the artery<br />\nand inflate the balloon with<br />\nfluid, thus forcing open the<br />\nblocked segment.<br />\nFor femoral PTA, the<br />\naverage patient bill was $2,767,<br />\nwhich was $5,431 less than for<br />\nbypass surgery. For iliac PTA,<br />\nthe average bill was $3,075,<br />\nwhich was $7,148 less than a<br />\ncomparable bypass. The differences are exclusive of professional fees which also are higher<br />\nfor surgery than for the balloon<br />\ntechnique.<br />\n\"PTA is less expensive,\"<br />\nKinnison explains, \"because<br />\nthe procedure does not require<br />\nsurgery or general anesthesia,<br />\nas does the bypass, and because<br />\nthe length of hospital stay is<br />\nshorter for PTA patients than<br />\nfor bypass patients.\"<br />\nFor instance, for femoral<br />\nPTA patients, the length of stay<br />\nis only 3.5 days, which is 12.3<br />\ndays shorter than for bypass<br />\npatients. The average length of<br />\nstay for iliac PTA patients was<br />\n3.6 days, which is 11.1 days<br />\nshorter than for bypass<br />\npatients.<br />\nFurthermore, PTA often can<br />\nbe performed at the time of the<br />\nx-ray diagnostic study of the<br />\narteries that all of these patients<br />\nmust undergo, even if they are<br />\nto be treated by surgery.<br />\n\"PTA for peripheral<br />\nvascular disease is an example<br />\n<br />\nof the new technological<br />\nare<br />\nthat<br />\ndevelopments<br />\nunderutilized from both a<br />\nclinical and financial viewpoint,\" the authors emphasize.<br />\nAmong reasons they cited for<br />\nunderutilization of PTA is the<br />\npatient referral pattern. Patients traditionally are seen first<br />\nby their internist or family<br />\nphysician who refers them to a<br />\nsurgeon. After diagnostic<br />\nangiography, the surgeon is<br />\nthen responsible for treating the<br />\npatient.<br />\n\"Either because of a lack of<br />\ninformation, lack of a<br />\nradiologist well-trained in<br />\nangioplasty techniques, or<br />\nsimply a desire to perform a<br />\nfamiliar and reliable procedure,<br />\npatients are not referred for<br />\nPTA.\"<br />\nHowever, \"These barriers<br />\nare rapidly being eliminated by<br />\nthe information now available<br />\non the efficacy of PTA, increasing numbers of wellinterventional<br />\ntrained<br />\nradiologists, and better<br />\neducated consumers.\"<br />\nIn addition, the investigators<br />\nnote, changes in the way<br />\nhospitals are reimbursed should<br />\noffer them the financial incentive to choose the least costly<br />\nmethod of treatment. \"While<br />\nnot all patients are candidates<br />\nfor PTA, and those with more<br />\nsevere disease are referred for<br />\nsurgery,\" the data in the new<br />\npaper \"demonstrates the potential financial benefit of performing PTA rather than<br />\noperating on suitable patients,\"<br />\nthe authors point out.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Haig Kazazian Jr.<br />\n<br />\nuses restriction endonucleases;<br />\nwhich are bacterial enzymes, to<br />\ncut the DNA at or near a<br />\nspecific sequence. The resulting<br />\ndigests are then electrophoresed through an agarose gel. The<br />\nfragments in the gel, which are<br />\nseparated by size, are then<br />\ndenatured and transferred to<br />\nnitrocellulose paper. The paper<br />\nis then incubated with a<br />\nradioactive probe that highlights the gene of interest. The<br />\npaper is then photographed by<br />\nthe process of autoradiography.<br />\nKan was the first to<br />\ndemonstrate a DNA polymorphism next to the beta-globin<br />\ngene. A polymorphism results<br />\nwhen one of two different but<br />\nnormal nucleotide sequences<br />\ncan exist at a particular site in<br />\nDNA,still resulting in the same<br />\nprotein. This polymorphism,<br />\nwhich is near the sickle mutation on the nucleotide chain,<br />\nwas an excellent marker for the<br />\nmutation because the mutation<br />\nand the polymorphism are<br />\nusually inherited together. The<br />\nmajority of sickle cell genes<br />\ncontained the polymorphism<br />\nwhile nearly all normal genes<br />\nlacked it. Family studies could<br />\nthen be done to determine<br />\n<br />\nwhether the presence of the<br />\nmarker or lack of the marker<br />\nwas coupled with the sickle cell<br />\nmutation.<br />\nPrenatal diagnosis was then<br />\ndone by using cells from the<br />\namniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis. If the mother and<br />\nthe father both have the sickle<br />\ncell marker, then one could<br />\nlook for the presence of<br />\nmarkers in fetal cells to determine if the fetus is affected or<br />\nnot. An affected fetus will have<br />\ntwo, sickle genes (SS), a carrier<br />\nhas a normal gepe and a sickle<br />\ngene(AS), while an unaffected<br />\nperson has two normal genes<br />\n(AA).<br />\n<br />\nHighlights<br />\n<br />\nSun., Feb. 17, 10:00a.m.:<br />\nThe New Literacy: An Introduction to Computers\u2014<br />\nGetting Information Out,<br />\nStoring Data; 7:00p.m.: The<br />\nLiving Planet: A Portrait of<br />\nthe Earth\u2014The Northern<br />\nForests; 8:00p.m.: Nature\u2014<br />\nThe Lost World of the<br />\nMedusae.<br />\n<br />\nPublic TV\u2014Science and<br />\nNature Programs<br />\nChannel 67, Baltimore<br />\nFri.,<br />\nFeb.<br />\n15,<br />\n7:30p.m.:Wild, Wild World<br />\nof Animals\u2014New World<br />\nMonkeys.<br />\nSat., Feb. 16, 8:30a.m.:<br />\nOceanus\u2014Ocean's Edge, The<br />\nIntertidal Edge; 10:30p.m.:<br />\nUnderstanding<br />\nHuman<br />\nBehavior\u2014Functions of the<br />\nBrain, Sensory Psychology;<br />\n11:30a.m.:<br />\nSocial<br />\nPsychology\u2014Psychosexual<br />\nDifferences II; 12:00p.m.: Exploring Language: Thinking,<br />\nWriting, Communicating\u2014<br />\nCommunities of Speech;<br />\n1:30p.m.: New Tech Times:.<br />\n2:00p.m.: The Nature of<br />\nThings\u2014Flight Simulators;<br />\n3:00p.m.: Nova (R)\u2014<br />\nAIDS:Chapter<br />\nOne;<br />\n8:00p.m.: The Undersea<br />\nJacques<br />\nof<br />\nWorld<br />\nCousteau\u2014Whales;9:00p.m.:<br />\nNature(R)\u2014Fungi: The Rotten World Around Us.<br />\n<br />\nA big boon in the diagnosis<br />\nof sickle cell anemia occurred in<br />\n1981 when three independent<br />\ngroups, Kazazian's group, collaborating with Orkin at Harvard, Kan in San Francisco,<br />\nand John Wilson in Georgia<br />\nfound an enzyme that eliminated the need for finding<br />\nmarkers.

Thus, it is specific<br />\nfor the single nucleotide change<br />\nthat produced the sickle cell<br />\nmutation. This direct technique<br />\nhas been used since 1982.<br />\nThis direct technique cannot<br />\nbe used for beta-thalassemia<br />\nbecause in this case there is<br />\ngreat genetic heterogeneity<br />\nfrom family to family. So far<br />\nabout thirty-five mutations<br />\nhave been found in the betaglobin gene that cause betathalassemia. Even though a<br />\nnumber of polymorphisms have<br />\nbeen found near the gene, each<br />\nmutation is associated with its<br />\nown<br />\nspecific<br />\npattern.<br />\nTherefore, no specific pattern<br />\ndefines the mutation as opposed to the normal gene, so each<br />\nfamily must be studied individually. Certain mutations are<br />\nmore prevalent than others. For<br />\ninstance, two particular mutations make up sixty to seventy<br />\npercent out of a total of fifteen<br />\nmutations which cause the<br />\ndisorder in the Mediterranean<br />\nbasin. The incidence of betathalassemia is particularly high<br />\nin this area. Prenatal diagnosis<br />\nin the United States is complicated because of the great<br />\nmixture of races; each ethnic<br />\ngroup has been found to have<br />\ndifferent sets of mutations.<br />\nCertain regions of the world<br />\nhave been found where betathalassemia results from one<br />\nl. selisl'isio<br />\n<br />\nops<br />\n<br />\noriginal mutation. This is called the Founder Effect. This<br />\nmeans all mutations are of a<br />\nsingle type. One of these<br />\nregions is the island of Sardinia<br />\nin the Mediterranean Sea where<br />\none out of every sixty couples<br />\nhas a twenty-five percent risk<br />\nwith each pregnancy of having<br />\nan affected child. Almost<br />\nninety-nine percent of these<br />\nThalassemias are from a single,<br />\noriginal mutation.<br />\nOverall, using DNA analysis,<br />\nKazazian's lab has been providing prenatal diagnosis for all<br />\nhemoglobinopathies since 1979.<br />\nThey have worked on 450 cases<br />\nso far: 250 for sickle cell<br />\nanemia, 105-110 for betathalassemia, and the rest for<br />\nother types of thalassemias.<br />\nMany other labs around the<br />\nworld are still using the old<br />\nmethod of fetal blood sampling<br />\nand hemoglobin analysis. These<br />\nlabs are mostly in Italy and<br />\nGreece, which on its own does<br />\nabout 500 cases a year. While<br />\nthese labs are incurring the<br />\nthree to four percent mortality<br />\nrate, the mortality rate for amniocentesis is only about one<br />\nper 500 fetuses. ,<br />\nA new technique called<br />\nChorion Villus Biopsy can be<br />\ndone much earlier in pregnancy at about 6-10 weeks as opposed to 16-18 weeks for amniocentesis. This could change<br />\nthe extent to which prenatal<br />\ndiagnosis is requested as many<br />\npeople find it distasteful to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester. Hopkins, so<br />\n<br />\nfar, has interpreted results from<br />\nabout 20 cases of hemoglobinopathies by this method.<br />\nFuture diagnosis is looking<br />\ntowards isolation of certain<br />\nchromosome abnormalities that<br />\nmay enhance susceptibility to<br />\ncarrying certain genetic<br />\ndisorders. Researchers would<br />\nalso like to learn about and find<br />\nmarkers for risk factors for all<br />\nkinds of common diseases. Carriers may have either a high or<br />\na low susceptibility.

Cardiac<br />\nhypertrophy, which involves<br />\nenlargement of the heart, occurs in many people with<br />\nhypertension.<br />\nDottin uncovered the<br />\ngenetic code for the enzyme in<br />\ncollaboration with two other<br />\nHopkins researchers, and<br />\nreported the results in Nucleic<br />\nAcids Research, a journal<br />\n<br />\npublished in Great Britain.<br />\n\"Although we still don't<br />\nunderstand the genetic factors<br />\nthat control the synthesis of<br />\nthis enzyme in persons with<br />\nmuscular dystrophy or cardiac<br />\nhypertrophy, this is a major<br />\nadvance in our research,\" said<br />\nDottin. \"This brings us one<br />\nstep closer to understanding<br />\nwhat controls the expression<br />\nof the gene, which could<br />\nreveal the underlying causes<br />\nof these disorders.\"<br />\nCreatine kinase comes in<br />\nthree different forms, and<br />\neach performs the same functions.

They reminded us<br />\nof the past success of the protest,\" said Keim.<br />\nThe students were loaded onto buses and driven to the protest site. This site was a couple<br />\nblocks away from the South<br />\nAfrican embassy because it is illegal to protest within five hundred feet of an embassy.<br />\nKeim said that the remarkable aspect of the protest was<br />\nthe incredible spirit of those involved. \"It was freezing, cold,<br />\nand windy, but the students remained undaunted in their pro-<br /><br />\ntest.\"<br />\nThe students marched with<br />\nsigns across the street from<br />\nother demonstrators on<br />\nMassachusetts Avenue. Keim<br />\nestimated that there were at least<br />\n200-300 people picketing. \"The<br />\nspirit was tremendous,\" continued Keim. \"People driving<br />\nby were honking at the<br />\npicketers and we were given an<br />\novation as we walked by.\"<br />\n\"We listened to speakers and<br />\nthey really helped to inspire the<br />\ngroup,\" said Keim. The<br />\nstudents then took a bus to the<br />\narrest site which was in front of<br />\nthe South African embassy.<br />\nWhile on the bus, the students<br />\nwere interviewed by the<br />\nBaltimore News-American. The<br />\nprotesters were greeted by an<br />\nunusually large number of D.C.<br />\npolicemen. The protesters, singing \"We Shall Overcome,\" remained in front of the embassy<br /><br />\nfor over one and a half hours<br />\nbefore they were arrested. \"The<br />\npolice were trying a standoff,\"<br />\nsaid Keim. \"However, I guess<br />\nthe cold and the wind got to<br />\nthem before us. The police were<br />\nsurprised that the protesters<br />\nhad such staying power.\"<br />\nAlthough it was a nervous<br />\nsituation, the majority of the<br />\nprotesters were arrested with<br />\ndignity. \"The situation was<br />\nalways under control. There<br />\nwas no chance of violence,\"<br />\nstated Keim.<br />\nThe entire procedure was extremely organized. Those who<br />\nwished to be arrested wore<br />\nyellow armbands to eliminate<br />\nconfusion among the protesters<br />\nand the police. The men and<br />\nwomen were taken away in<br />\nseparate paddy wagons and to<br />\nseparate cells.

Their hearing is set for<br />\nMarch 14. However, Keim says<br />\nthat charges are usually dropped prior to the hearing. All the<br />\nstudents were headed back for<br />\nBaltimore by 10:00 p.m.<br />\n\"They were a very dedicated,<br />\nvery respectable group of people supporting an unquestionable movement,\" said<br />\nKeim. He also feels that the<br />\ncampus is becoming more active and that the overall<br />\nawareness concerning the problem of apartheid in South<br />\nAfrica has been heightened.<br />\nKeim is strongly opposed to<br />\nHopkins' policy of investing in<br />\ncompanies who have interests<br /><br />\nin South Africa. He feels that<br />\na change in South African<br />\npolicies, either violent or<br />\npeaceful, is inevitable. Keim<br />\nfeels, \"It would be good for<br />\nJohns Hopkins to insure a<br />\npeaceful change in South<br />\nAfrica.\" He believes that<br />\nHopkins is making a profit<br />\nfrom the abuse of black people.<br />\nHe compares it to \"doing<br />\nbusiness with pre-World War II<br />\nGermany in the late thirties.\"<br />\nKeim says that this \"tainted<br />\nmoney\" is made from cheap<br />\nlabor and the killing and imprisonment of labor leaders in<br />\nSouth Africa.

The<br />\ntrip yielded a startling major<br />\nfossil discovery\u2014a nearly complete skeleton of Homo erectus.<br />\nWalker, who is a professor<br />\nof cell biology and anatomy at<br />\nthe School of Medicine, spoke<br />\nas part of the Wednesday Noon<br />\nSeries. He began his talk with<br />\na brief summary of previous<br />\nfinds of Homo erectus, a<br />\npredecessor of Homo sapiens.<br />\nAfter Darwin published The<br />\nDescent of Man, German<br />\nzoologist Haeckel anticipated<br />\nthe discovery of Homo erectus<br />\nas the \"missing link\" between<br />\nape and man. Java Man and<br />\nPeking Man were the first major fossils of Homo erectus<br />\nuncovered.<br />\nThe next major finding in<br />\nthis area was the well-publicized<br />\nwork of Dr. L. S. B. Leakey in<br />\nTanzania's Olduvai Gorge in<br />\nthe 1960s. A number of<br />\nvaluable fossils was found by<br />\nanother member of the Leakey<br />\nfamily, Richard Leakey, in the<br />\n1970s at the Koobi Fora site on<br />\nthe eastern shore of Lake<br />\nTurkana in Kenya. Included<br />\namong these was a Homo erectus who had suffered from<br />\nperiostitis, an inflammatory<br />\nbone disease due to an excess of<br />\ndietary vitamin A which is present in high levels in the livers<br />\nof carnivores. This is strong<br /><br />\nevidence that man was still<br />\nprimarily a hunter when Homo<br />\nerectus appeared 1.5 to 2<br />\nmillion years ago. However,<br />\nwhile these fossils led many to<br />\npostulate the importance of<br />\nHomo erectus in the course of<br />\nhuman evolution, the evidence<br />\nwas still fragmentary and<br />\ninconclusive.<br />\nDuring August and September of last year, Walker<br />\nworked with Leakey at a site on<br />\nthe western shore of Lake<br />\nTurkana near the Sudanese<br />\nborder. A section of jawbone<br />\nwas found and led to an exploration of the site which<br />\nyielded a nearly complete skull<br />\nwhich was pieced together from<br />\nover 70 fragments. Further excavation resulted in the<br />\ndiscovery of a nearly complete<br />\nHomo erectus skeleton scattered throughout sedimentary<br />\nparticles in the remnants of a<br />\nprehistoric swamp. Based on<br />\nthe dental eruption and growth<br />\nplates on bones, the specimen<br />\nwas determined to be about 12<br />\nyears of age in modern human<br />\nterms. The prehistoric pre-teen<br />\nwas identified as a male by the<br />\nstructure of the pelvic bone and<br />\ngeochemical dating techniques<br />\nshow that the fossils are 1.6<br />\nmillion years old. The bone<br />\nstructure clearly shows that the<br />\nboy was well over six feet and<br />\na review of fragments of other<br />\nHomo erectus fossils showed<br />\nthat man has been getting<br />\nsmaller in stature as evolution<br />\ncontinues.<br />\nWhen juxtaposed with<br /><br />\nNeanderthal Man, some in- similarities which are not seen<br />\ntriguing revelations are made in a comparison with an adult<br />\nconcerning man's evolution ap- Homo erectus.<br />\nproximately two million years<br />\nMuch information was also<br />\nago.

Underclassmen may likewise have constructive suggestions. To disregard such information or to<br />\nexclude it from formal deliberation seems<br />\nsenseless and the approach should be<br />\nreconsidered.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nMore on Fraternities<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nMr. Warren's article of last<br />\nweek concerning the history of<br />\nfraternities at Johns Hopkins illuminates many of the problems that exist within the<br />\nfraternities and their relationship with the university. By<br />\ncomparing the student involvement (and behavior) of today,<br />\none might predict a general<br />\ndecline for these social<br />\norganizations with a forseeable<br />\nconclusion. But that rationalization would be based on<br />\na few well-publicized events and<br />\nnot include the overall change<br />\nin the fraternities that has occurred over the past few years.<br />\nTo be more precise, this past<br />\nyear every fraternity has taken<br />\nextraordinary measures (in<br />\ncomparison to past measures)<br />\nto cooperate with the university and neighbors. This fall the<br />\nInter-Fraternity Council, after<br />\nconsulting with the university,<br />\npassed a resolution on \"Open<br />\nParty Policy,\" dramatically<br />\ncurbing problems that accompanied these events. New<br />\nrestrictions were enforced on<br />\nactivity outside the houses: the<br />\nnumber of kegs allowed, the<br />\ntime parties were to break up,<br />\netc. Fraternities also tried to improve their image by sponsoring athletic and relay games<br />\nduring a \"Greek Weekend.\"<br /><br />\nWhile this event received little<br />\npublicity, it was an effort by the<br />\nI.F.C. to show that frats were<br />\nnot just \"the party.\" Most<br />\nrecently, the I.F.C. \"dried out<br />\nRush,\" for all intents and purposes, by recommending fines<br />\nfor fraternities that the university and I.F.C. felt had violated<br />\nRush policies. (This was an inevitable event that has ocurred<br />\nat most colleges where the state<br />\ndrinking age has risen.) This<br />\nlatest action demonstrates the<br />\nfraternities' collective will to<br />\npolice themselves and to conform to the prevailing attitudes<br />\nof the university and the nation<br />\nin regards to alcohol. A letter<br />\nthat appeared in the NewsLetter two weeks ago commented on the alterations in the<br />\nfraternity parties in just the past<br />\nfew years. It should be clear to<br />\nthe university and students that<br />\nfrats have drastically cleaned up<br />\ntheir act in the past few years.<br />\nEven with all the changes<br />\nthat fraternities have implemented, does this mean the<br />\nbrothers have acquired halos<br />\nand do only good deeds? Certainly not. Fraternities must<br />\nunderstand what has brought<br />\ndown the weight of the administration, neighbors, and<br />\nevery anti-alcohol interest on<br />\ntheir shoulders. The drinking<br />\nlaw changed and frats didn't.<br />\nWe kept on throwing open<br />\nparties\u2014calmer than their wild<br />\npredecessors of the 1970's\u2014yet,<br /><br />\n\"open\" nonetheless. The<br />\nuniversity could not help but<br />\nraise an eyebrow when young<br />\nstudents staggered into the<br />\ndorms with tales of drunkeness<br />\nand debauchery in smoke-filled<br />\nrooms. Each tale was exaggerated and amplified until the<br />\nadministration was presented a<br />\npicture of Hopkins fraternities<br />\nas being the source of evil in the<br />\nmodern world.<br />\nWhat,then, is the answer for<br />\nfrats? The answer is mellow-out<br />\nthe parties. We need only to<br />\nlook into our own histories to<br />\nfind the answer to our recent<br />\nproblems. Prior to 1973, the<br />\ndrinking age in Maryland was<br />\n21. According to alumni, parties occurred\u2014but were usually closed, well-tempered,<br />\ndiscrete affairs.

I hope you enjoy it<br />\nmore than I have.<br />\n1. Dinner<br />\nRight after graduation<br />\neverybody goes out to dinner<br />\nwith their families. But since<br />\nmy sister and brother-in-law<br />\nshowed up at the last minute<br />\nwith their kid, there wasn't<br />\nenough room for everyone in<br />\nthe car. So I stayed, and they<br />\nall went out to eat. No kidding,<br />\nI really did. I ended up eating<br />\nhalf a pizza over at P.J.'s.<br />\nwhich wasn't so bad at all considering I found out later about<br />\nthe scene my dad made at the<br />\nrestaurant where they went. He<br />\ndidn't have reservations, so he<br />\ntold the hostess he had tuberculosis. Then he pretty much<br />\nhad his pick of tables.<br />\n2. Lacrosse finals<br />\nI locked my keys in my car,<br />\nand a couple guys from<br />\nSyracuse offered to give me a<br />\nhand getting them out, which I<br />\nfigured was pretty nice since<br />\ntheir team had just lost the<br />\nchampionship. It would've<br />\nbeen even nicer if they'd explained to me beforehand that<br />\nthey were going to use large<br />\nrocks to do it. Anyway, they<br />\ngot the keys out, and I probably<br />\nended up saving a ton of money<br />\nbecause I didn't have to use the<br />\nair-conditioner all summer.<br />\n3. Work<br />\nThis gigantic company gave<br />\nme a job for the summer. I<br />\nwould tell you what I did, but<br />\neven now I'm not quite sure.<br />\nThey sure did give me a lot of<br />\nmoney for doing it, though.<br /><br />\n4. Movies<br />\nI saw a bunch of movies<br />\nbecause I had so much money<br />\nfrom working for this gigantic<br />\ncompany. Anyway, I saw this<br />\none really terrific one. I don't<br />\nremember the name of it. Or<br />\nwho was in it. Or what it was<br />\nabout. But you should see it if<br />\nyou have a chance. You really<br />\nshould.<br />\n5. Weddings<br />\nPractically everybody I know<br />\ngot married right after graduation, so I ended up having to,<br />\nbuy a million wine decanters. I<br />\nhave no idea at all what you're<br />\nsupposed to do with them. I<br />\nmean, I know you're supposed<br />\nto use them for wine, but<br />\neveryone I know drinks wine<br />\nright out of the bottle. Maybe<br />\nyou're supposed to pour it in<br />\nthis first. Who knows?<br />\nAnyway, my mom said I should<br />\nbuy them, and she knows about<br />\nthese things since most of her<br />\nfriends have been married halfa-dozen times each.<br />\n\u2022 6. Weird<br />\nI think I started missing all of<br />\nmy friends from Hopkins too<br />\nmuch because all of a sudden<br />\nmy mind just went berserk on<br />\nme, and I started thinking these<br />\nreally weird things. Like, what<br />\nif chocolate were poisonous. I'd<br />\nbet people wouldn't eat so<br />\nmuch of it then. Have you ever<br />\nthought of that? Well, it's true.<br />\n7. More weddings<br />\nThis girl I used to date got<br />\nmarried, which put me in a rotten mood. So I found out what<br />\nhotel they were staying in on<br />\ntheir wedding night and kept<br />\ncalling up to say that there was<br />\na bomb in one of the rooms. I<br />\nknow that's probably illegal or<br />\nsomething, but I really got a<br />\nkick out of it.<br />\n8. Clothes<br />\nI still had a lot of money<br />\nfrom working for that gigantic<br />\ncompany, so I bought all of<br />\nthese super clothes. The only<br />\nproblem was that they looked<br />\nbetter on those mannequins<br />\nthan on me. Like this Indiana<br /><br />\nJones hat I bought, for instance, makes me look more<br />\nlike Don Knotts than Indiana<br />\nJones. I would've taken it back<br />\nexcept that girls really like the<br />\nway Don Knotts looks. Really.<br />\nMy sister told me that.<br />\n9. Law school<br />\nI went to law school. For<br />\nthree weeks. I'd really rather<br />\nnot talk about this except to<br />\nmake it clear that I did not get<br />\nthrown out like everyone thinks<br />\nI did. I mean, the only way you<br />\ncould possibly get thrown out<br />\nof law school after three weeks<br />\nwould be if you failed orientation, which 1 didn't. I swear.<br />\nYou could ask the dean.<br />\n10. Writing<br />\nI decided to combine my<br />\npolitical science background<br />\nwith my love of fiction and<br />\ncame up with some great<br />\nstories. Tell me what you think<br />\nof these: \"Rasputin Goes to<br />\nBaskin-Robbins,\" \"William<br />\nthe Conqueror Coaches a Little League Baseball Team,\"<br />\n\"George S.

Remind me to tell you sometime.<br />\n12. Money<br />\nI spent all of the money I'd<br />\nmade from that gigantic company, so I had to start borrowing from friends and selling<br />\nthings just to get by. I even sold<br />\na station wagon for $500, which<br />\nwas a pretty good deal since it<br />\nbelonged to our next-door<br />\nneighbors, the Kaels, who were<br />\nat Great Adventure for the day.<br />\nI could've gotten $1000 for it if<br />\nI wanted to haggle, but I<br />\nfigured why be a jerk.<br /><br />\nFred factorial<br />\nThetrilic s-tori of a malt<br />\n40 must come Az -terms wiih<br />\net-notional and Fhpical toriure<br />\ndurint3 one oF history's clarkesi60-5...

Then I go<br />\nhome and write a letter and<br />\napologize for it.<br />\n14. Work<br />\nI got another job writing,<br />\nwhich is a good job because my<br />\neditor's cute. She's got blonde<br />\nhair, and she's 28, and the best<br />\npart about the whole thing is<br />\nthat she thinks I'm 28, too.<br />\nThat's pretty funny if you ask<br />\nme because there's no way in<br />\nthe world I even look like I'm<br />\n15.

So Mr. Kael came over and<br />\nchased me all around our house<br />\nwith his Toro weed-and-garden<br />\ntrimmer. I fell down the basement stairs and broke my right<br />\nleg, which used to be my<br />\nfavorite one of the two but isn't<br />\nany more, and while I was on<br />\nthe ground crying, Mr. Kael<br />\nclipped off my eyebrows.<br />\n16. Music<br />\nI'm sharing a room with my<br />\nbrother these days, and he's the<br />\nbassist in a rock band called<br />\nAccelerator.

First of all, this is the<br /><br />\nfirst time (I think) that every<br />\nsenior was given a letter requesting nominations for Student Activities Awards(formerly known as SAC seals). This<br />\nwas done to give everyone in<br />\nthe class an opportunity to have<br />\nsome say in who is chosen for<br />\nthese awards.<br />\nThis process was worked out<br />\nbetween the SAC Executive<br />\nBoard and myself, representing<br />\nthe Senior Class. Much of it<br />\ndepends upon mutual understanding by the two parties, but<br />\non the whole, it is structured<br />\nmuch better that it has been in<br />\nthe past.<br />\nMy real gripe is towards the<br />\nSenior Class, itself. The boxes<br />\nwere stuffed on Feb. 1st, and<br />\nnow, two weeks later, we have<br />\nnext to nothing in the way of<br />\nnominations. Come on Seniors,<br />\nlet's get with it!

Hansen<br />\nGlobal Tuition Race<br />\nTo the Edi;or:<br />\nLast week saw another<br />\ndangerous escalation in the<br />\nglobal tuition race as Johns<br />\nHopkins President Steven<br />\nMuller proposed an $800 tuition hike, bringing the yearly<br />\nJHU total to $14,160. This was<br />\napparently in response to the<br />\nincrease announced by Yale the<br />\nweek before, and it has sparked Brown's $1,100 rise to<br />\n$15,000.<br />\nThese actions violate the<br />\n1972 Tuition Limitation Treaty (TILT) and virtually<br />\neliminate any hope for a<br />\nresumption of the stalled Tui-<br /><br />\ntion Reduction Talks (TORT)<br />\nin Duluth.<br />\nIt is clear that these universities no longer believe that tuition reduction is possible, and<br />\nso they have decided to maintain the policy of Mutually<br />\nAssured Money (MAM). This<br />\ncan only hasten the spiral down<br />\nto global disintegration. At<br />\nleast thirty universities in the<br />\nUnited States alone now have<br />\nthe tuition to buy the world<br />\nseveral times over. And yet,<br />\nthey continue to increase their<br />\ndemands, all in the name of<br />\n\"academic readiness\" and<br />\n\"career security.\" According to<br />\nVice-President George Bush,<br />\nacademic readiness is \"way,<br />\nway up,\" from the late '70's,<br />\nand career security \"has never<br />\nbeen better.\"<br />\nBut they still ask for more<br />\nmoney.

Between the hours of 6:00 p.m.<br />\nand 2:00 a.m., 7 days a week,<br />\nthere will be monitors stationed in both the freshman and<br />\nGilman quads. Their main purpose is to make sure all is quiet<br />\nin the quads. However, these<br />\nmonitors are also open to give<br />\nfoot escorts around campus or<br />\njust off Charles Street. During<br />\nthe end of night school classes<br />\n(7:45-8:15 p.m.), one of the<br />\nmonitors moves to the lower<br />\nDavid Chen, '87 quad to aid people leaving<br /><br />\nclass.<br />\nEach monitor carries a<br />\nwalkie-talkie (the same ones<br />\ncarried by security), so if a<br />\nmonitor sees or experiences<br />\ntrouble, he is able to call security for immediate help. To request a foot escort, just ask one<br />\nof the monitors (we should<br />\nhave orange vests soon to make<br />\nus more visible) or call security.<br />\nDeserving the credit for this<br />\nidea is Student Council's<br />\nBuldings and Grounds Committee, and JHU Security.

Diane<br />\nKeaton does fine work as the title character, the wife of a<br />\nprison warden who falls in love<br />\nwith one of the convicts. As<br />\nJack Biddle, Mel Gibson is<br />\nequally effective as the powerful, sexy prisoner who frees<br />\nKate Soffel from her straightlaced, schoolmarm persona.<br />\nBut the story itself, while told<br />\nextremely well, is flawed all the<br />\nsame.<br />\nMatthew<br />\nGibson and<br />\nModine, who plays Jack's<br />\nbrother and partner in crime,<br />\nhave been placed on death row<br />\nfor the murder of a shopkeeper<br />\nin 1901 Pittsburgh. It is behind<br />\nbars that the brothers encounter<br />\nKeaton. As Mrs. Soffel, Keaton<br />\nhas recently recovered from a<br />\nthree-month illness which imposed an equally long sexual<br />\nisolation from her husband (an<br />\nisolation which she chooses to<br />\ncontinue after the illness subsides). Healthy again, she has<br />\nresumed the task of spreading<br />\nbibles and religion amongst her<br />\nhusband's prisoners.<br />\nThe young ladies of Pittsburgh are under the spell of<br />\nGibson's sexual magnetism as<br />\nthey gather outside the prison<br />\nto protest and lament his imminent hanging. Keaton, displaying a pronounced middleagedness, is similarly attracted<br />\nto the younger, wild Gibson.<br />\nUsing this fact to his advantage,<br />\nGibson has Keaton smuggle<br />\nsaw blades to him and his<br />\nbrother to cut the cell bars, her<br />\nbible the means by which the<br /><br />\nso<br />\nAl<br />\nwl<br />\nmi<br />\nthi<br />\ntu<br />\nch<br />\nrel<br />\nati<br /><br />\nas<br />\ned<br />\nan<br />\nfai<br />\nin<br />\nth<br /><br />\nUn<br />\nSt(<br />\nM<br /><br />\ndc<br /><br />\nmi<br /><br />\nBi<br />\nis<br />\nsa<br />\nw(<br />\nsh<br />\nsy<br />\nbr<br />\nhy<br />\nhe<br />\nth,<br />\ntal<br /><br />\nth,<br />\ndu<br />\nNv(<br />\nin<br />\nJa<br />\nsh<br />\nhi;<br /><br />\n'Nen<br /><br />\n:Et)<br /><br />\nRE<br />\nIAL<br /><br />\nPress Photo<br /><br />\nblades are brought to and from<br />\nthe prison.

To her credit, director<br />\nArmstrong does not overplay<br />\nthe happy banter. For all the<br />\njokes, the Biddies never seem to<br />\nlose sight of their destiny.<br />\nAmong Kate Soffel's family<br />\nare two daughters, each<br />\nrepresenting a distinct side of<br />\ntheir mother's personality: the<br />\nolder, pragmatic daughter,<br />\nwho, like mother, will be married by age seventeen, and the<br /><br />\nyounger daughter, who speaks<br />\nof the devil taking over her soul<br />\nand is obsessed with the Biddies' case. Kate formally rejects<br />\nthe older child the day of the<br />\nprison break, the day Kate<br />\nleaves her husband to escape<br />\nwith Jack. And when the film's<br />\nsad ending finally arrives, it is<br />\nthe older daughter who is the<br />\nfirst to welcome her mother<br />\nback to reality.<br />\nMrs. Soffel never successfully captures the 1901 feel<br />\nfor which it should be striving.<br />\nWhile the sets do look perfect,<br />\nand the acting as well, a<br />\nnumber of the camera angles<br />\nseem a bit too \"current\" for the<br />\nContinued on Page 19<br /><br />\noiski<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/19<br /><br />\nKeaton and Gibson Star Record Reviews<br />\nby Tom Ferraro<br />\nContinued from Page 18<br /><br />\nscenes being photographed.<br />\nAlso, Mark Isham's score,<br />\nwhile effective, often has too<br />\nmodern a feel to it. But these<br />\nthings detract little from the actual story Ms. Armstrong<br />\nchooses to tell, and succeeds in<br />\nrelating in an emotion-packed<br />\natmosphere.<br />\nMrs. Soffel is advertised<br />\nas a true story. We are reminded of this in the opening credits,<br />\nand Ms. Armstrong has gone so<br />\nfar as to shoot the prison scenes<br />\nin the Allegheny County Jail,<br />\nthe place the story originally<br />\nunfolded. Unfortunately the<br />\nstory, as presented, never seems<br />\nmore than \"only a story;\" it<br />\ndoes not ring true.<br />\nWhether the brothers are<br />\nmurderers is what the film calls<br />\ninto question, not whether the<br />\nRiddles are criminals; the latter<br />\nLS established as fact. All the<br />\nsame, it is a fact Armstrong<br />\nwould prefer we overlook as<br />\nshe presents an astonishingly<br />\nsYmpathetic picture of the<br />\nbrothers. Jack never seems as<br />\nhypocritical as he must be when<br />\nhe initiates a relationship with<br />\nthe warden's wife. Armstrong<br />\ntakes great pains to show the<br />\nmistreatment of the Biddies by<br />\nthe prison guards and how,<br />\nduring the escape, the guards<br />\nwere done no form of serious<br />\nInjury.

This sounds like<br />\nthe generic music you hear on<br />\nTV shows when they go to<br />\ndance clubs (especially on The<br />\nLove Boat). One song reaches<br />\nabout the pace of a TV chase<br />\nscene but the rest fall very flat.<br />\nThese people obviously haven't<br />\nbeen down on the street and<br />\nlistening for a long time. Also<br />\nthe music publishing company<br />\nis Skratch, but don't expect to<br />\nhear any scratching. What a<br />\nletdown-2.<br />\nSpeaking of dancing, I was<br />\ndrawn in by all those ads in the<br />\nCity Paper for Cignel, a new<br />\ndance club on East Lafayette<br />\n(around the corner from the<br />\nCharles Theatre). I got there<br />\naround 12, which I knew was<br />\nearly, but I figured since it closed at 4:00 a.m., what the heck.<br />\nAnyway, about fifteen other<br />\npeople and I waited around until 1:30 when the action started<br />\nto pick up. At least it gave me<br />\na chance to check the place out.<br />\nIt's very new, and the layout is<br />\nplanned well: loud music in the<br />\ndance floor area, lower volume<br />\nin the bar and lounge areas.<br />\nThe music selection was<br /><br />\nreasonable, but the same DJ<br />\nisn't there every week, so who<br />\nknows. The one when I was<br />\nthere (Jeremy) suffered from<br />\nthat dreaded disease which I<br />\nwill dub \"club dj-itis\": you<br />\nknow when the bass is real<br />\nhigh, since you can feel your<br />\nchest vibrate. All that doesn't<br />\nmatter when you're out on the<br />\ndance floor, and the music was<br />\nvery danceable.<br />\nOne drawback was the lack<br />\nof light in the dance floor area.<br />\nI like to see what I'm getting into when I ask someone to<br />\ndance. Also, don't worry about<br />\nbeing proofed, kiddies, because<br />\nthey don't have a liquor license.<br />\nBut if you ask nicely, they<br />\nmight give you some champagne punch which they keep<br />\nunder the counter. And check<br />\nout the bad art (at least the<br />\nweek I was there) on the walls<br />\n(all for sale). It's only open<br />\nFridays, so if you don't mind<br />\ndancing alone, go early for<br />\nyour best dancing dollar<br />\nbargain (five bucks admission)<br />\nhave a few at Club Charles, and<br />\ndance the night away.<br />\nAnd for a special treat, when<br />\nthe long-lamented WJHU<br />\ncomes back on the air, listen<br />\nTuesday morning 3-6 a.m. for<br />\nthe aural equivalent of this<br />\ncolumn.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/21<br /><br />\nScience<br />\nAmniocentesis Yields Early Sickle Cell Detection<br />\nby Robin Gugenheim<br /><br />\nThe field of prenatal<br />\ndiagnosis has grown in recent<br />\nyears into an exciting and<br />\ndiverse science. The recent advances are a result of applying<br />\nrecombinant DNA techniques<br />\nto the various problems of<br />\nclinical medicine and genetics.<br />\nHaig Kazazian Jr., M.D.,<br />\nDirector of the Genetics Unit in<br />\nthe Department of Pediatrics at<br />\nHopkins, began his research<br />\nwith hemoglobinopathies,<br />\nvarious disorders of the red<br />\nblood cell protein hemoglobin,<br />\naround 1970. Kazazian, along<br />\nwith Stylianos E. Antonarakis,<br />\nM.D., Alan Scott, Ph.D., and<br />\nCorinne D. Boehm, M.S., are<br />\npresently studying DNA from<br />\nfamilies where sickle cell<br />\nanemia, beta-thalassemia, other<br />\nhemoglobinopathies, and<br />\nhemophilia traits are present.<br />\nWhen prenatal diagnosis<br />\nbegan in 1970 not much was<br />\nknown about this intriguing<br />\nfield. Researchers discovered<br />\nthat the beta-globin chain of<br />\nhemoglobin, that would be affected in sickle-cell anemia and<br />\nbeta-thalassemia, two genetic<br />\ndisorders, is produced in early<br />\nfetal life. Therefore, it would be<br />\nbiologically possible to carry<br /><br />\nout prenatal detection of these<br />\ndiseases if one could get a fetal<br />\nblood sample. This analysis<br />\ndepended upon the actual protein product, beta-hemoglobin,<br />\nof the beta-globin gene.<br />\nHobbins and Mahoney at<br />\nYale, and other groups around<br />\nthe world, started developing<br />\nfetoscopy around 1975, which<br />\nis used to obtain fetal blood<br />\nsamples. This procedure,<br />\nalthough highly successful, carries a risk of about 3 to 4 percent fatality depending upon<br />\nthe skill of the obstetrician.<br />\nThis test entails putting a<br />\nfiberoptic scope, with a light<br />\nsource, through the abdominal<br />\nwall, through the uterus, and<br />\ninto the amniotic sac. The field<br />\nof vision is very small, such<br />\nthat, when looking at the extremities, only a part of the<br />\nfetus's hand can be observed at<br />\none time. Blood is then taken<br />\nfrom a placental vein on the inner surface near the fetus.<br />\nY.W. Kan in San Francisco did<br />\nthe first procedures for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia and<br />\nbeta-thalasSemia in 1975-6.<br />\nSickle cell anemia and betathalassemia are two genetic<br />\ndisorders where the beta-globin<br />\nchain of hemoglobin carries a<br />\nmutation that alters its chemical<br />\nstructure. Sickle cell anemia can<br /><br />\nbe deadly although about half<br />\nof its victims live to 35 or 40<br />\nyears of age. The red blood<br />\ncells of afflicted individuals exhibit the characteristic sickle<br />\nshape that inspired the name of<br />\nthe disease. Carriers, who only<br />\npossess one affected gene, exhibit a moderate sickling of<br />\ntheir red blood cells. Betathalassemia, a much more<br />\nsevere disease, results from a<br />\nmutation in a single nucleotide<br />\nbase or a deletion of a particular region of the beta-globin<br />\ngene. These patients must be<br />\ntreated with frequent blood<br />\ntransfusions, but the resulting<br />\naccumulation of iron causes<br />\npremature death for most<br />\npatients.<br />\nThe use of recombinant<br />\nDNA technology in 1978 was a<br />\nmajor breakthrough for<br />\nprenatal<br />\ndiagnosis<br />\nof<br />\nhemoglobinopathies. By using<br />\nthe technique of Southern Blot<br />\nAnalysis one could look at the<br />\nbeta-globin gene itself. This<br />\nmeans that the hemoglobin<br />\nmolecule isn't needed and<br />\ntherefore, any cell from the<br />\nbody may be used for analysis,<br />\nnot just red blood cells. The<br />\nDNA could be obtained by the<br />\nknown<br />\nas<br />\nprocedure<br />\namniocentesis.<br />\nThe Southern Blot Analysis<br /><br />\nPOP<br /><br />\nBalloons Used to Treat Arteries<br />\nWider use of the balloon inflation technique instead of<br />\nbypass surgery to treat narrowed or obstructed arteries in the<br />\nleg offers the potential for<br />\nsubstantial cost savings without<br />\nsacrificing good patient care,<br />\naccording to investigators at the<br />\nHopkins Medical Institutions.<br />\n\"While overutilization of<br />\ndiagnostic radiology has been a<br />\npopular theme to explain increasing medical costs,<br />\nunderutilization of interventional radiology procedures,<br />\nsuch as the balloon technique,<br />\nalso are a factor in rising<br />\ncosts,\" they say.<br />\nIn a group of 86 patients<br />\ntreated at Hopkins Hospital,<br />\nthe length of stay averaged 4 to<br />\n4.5 times longer, and the total<br />\nhospital charge was 3 to 3.7<br />\ntimes greater for the surgical<br />\nbypass group than for the<br />\ngroup treated with the balloon<br />\ntechnique\u2014percutaneous<br />\ntransluminal angioplasty<br />\n(PTA).<br />\nThe findings were presented<br />\nat the recent Radiological<br />\nSociety of North America<br />\nmeeting in Washington, D.C.,<br />\nby a team led by Malonnie L.<br />\nKinnison, M.D., assistant professor of radiology.<br />\nThe investigators analyzed<br />\ncosts in treating diseased portions of the femoral artery,<br />\nwhich extends from just below<br />\nthe hip to the knee, and the iliac artery, which extends from<br />\nthe navel to the crease at the top<br />\nof the leg.<br />\nWhen these arteries become<br />\nblocked by atherosclerotic plaque, surgeons traditionally have<br />\ncorrected the problem by<br /><br />\nremoving a vein from some<br />\nother area of the body and grafting it to the artery above and<br />\nbelow the blockage\u2014thereby<br />\n\"bypassing\" the trouble spot.<br />\nIn PTA, interventional<br />\nradiologists thread a catheter<br />\nwith a balloon tip into the<br />\nobstructed segment of the artery<br />\nand inflate the balloon with<br />\nfluid, thus forcing open the<br />\nblocked segment.<br />\nFor femoral PTA, the<br />\naverage patient bill was $2,767,<br />\nwhich was $5,431 less than for<br />\nbypass surgery. For iliac PTA,<br />\nthe average bill was $3,075,<br />\nwhich was $7,148 less than a<br />\ncomparable bypass. The differences are exclusive of professional fees which also are higher<br />\nfor surgery than for the balloon<br />\ntechnique.<br />\n\"PTA is less expensive,\"<br />\nKinnison explains, \"because<br />\nthe procedure does not require<br />\nsurgery or general anesthesia,<br />\nas does the bypass, and because<br />\nthe length of hospital stay is<br />\nshorter for PTA patients than<br />\nfor bypass patients.\"<br />\nFor instance, for femoral<br />\nPTA patients, the length of stay<br />\nis only 3.5 days, which is 12.3<br />\ndays shorter than for bypass<br />\npatients. The average length of<br />\nstay for iliac PTA patients was<br />\n3.6 days, which is 11.1 days<br />\nshorter than for bypass<br />\npatients.<br />\nFurthermore, PTA often can<br />\nbe performed at the time of the<br />\nx-ray diagnostic study of the<br />\narteries that all of these patients<br />\nmust undergo, even if they are<br />\nto be treated by surgery.<br />\n\"PTA for peripheral<br />\nvascular disease is an example<br /><br />\nof the new technological<br />\nare<br />\nthat<br />\ndevelopments<br />\nunderutilized from both a<br />\nclinical and financial viewpoint,\" the authors emphasize.<br />\nAmong reasons they cited for<br />\nunderutilization of PTA is the<br />\npatient referral pattern. Patients traditionally are seen first<br />\nby their internist or family<br />\nphysician who refers them to a<br />\nsurgeon. After diagnostic<br />\nangiography, the surgeon is<br />\nthen responsible for treating the<br />\npatient.<br />\n\"Either because of a lack of<br />\ninformation, lack of a<br />\nradiologist well-trained in<br />\nangioplasty techniques, or<br />\nsimply a desire to perform a<br />\nfamiliar and reliable procedure,<br />\npatients are not referred for<br />\nPTA.\"<br />\nHowever, \"These barriers<br />\nare rapidly being eliminated by<br />\nthe information now available<br />\non the efficacy of PTA, increasing numbers of wellinterventional<br />\ntrained<br />\nradiologists, and better<br />\neducated consumers.\"<br />\nIn addition, the investigators<br />\nnote, changes in the way<br />\nhospitals are reimbursed should<br />\noffer them the financial incentive to choose the least costly<br />\nmethod of treatment. \"While<br />\nnot all patients are candidates<br />\nfor PTA, and those with more<br />\nsevere disease are referred for<br />\nsurgery,\" the data in the new<br />\npaper \"demonstrates the potential financial benefit of performing PTA rather than<br />\noperating on suitable patients,\"<br />\nthe authors point out.<br /><br />\nDr. Haig Kazazian Jr.<br /><br />\nuses restriction endonucleases;<br />\nwhich are bacterial enzymes, to<br />\ncut the DNA at or near a<br />\nspecific sequence. The resulting<br />\ndigests are then electrophoresed through an agarose gel. The<br />\nfragments in the gel, which are<br />\nseparated by size, are then<br />\ndenatured and transferred to<br />\nnitrocellulose paper. The paper<br />\nis then incubated with a<br />\nradioactive probe that highlights the gene of interest. The<br />\npaper is then photographed by<br />\nthe process of autoradiography.<br />\nKan was the first to<br />\ndemonstrate a DNA polymorphism next to the beta-globin<br />\ngene. A polymorphism results<br />\nwhen one of two different but<br />\nnormal nucleotide sequences<br />\ncan exist at a particular site in<br />\nDNA,still resulting in the same<br />\nprotein. This polymorphism,<br />\nwhich is near the sickle mutation on the nucleotide chain,<br />\nwas an excellent marker for the<br />\nmutation because the mutation<br />\nand the polymorphism are<br />\nusually inherited together. The<br />\nmajority of sickle cell genes<br />\ncontained the polymorphism<br />\nwhile nearly all normal genes<br />\nlacked it. Family studies could<br />\nthen be done to determine<br /><br />\nwhether the presence of the<br />\nmarker or lack of the marker<br />\nwas coupled with the sickle cell<br />\nmutation.<br />\nPrenatal diagnosis was then<br />\ndone by using cells from the<br />\namniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis.

Thus, it is specific<br />\nfor the single nucleotide change<br />\nthat produced the sickle cell<br />\nmutation. This direct technique<br />\nhas been used since 1982.<br />\nThis direct technique cannot<br />\nbe used for beta-thalassemia<br />\nbecause in this case there is<br />\ngreat genetic heterogeneity<br />\nfrom family to family. So far<br />\nabout thirty-five mutations<br />\nhave been found in the betaglobin gene that cause betathalassemia. Even though a<br />\nnumber of polymorphisms have<br />\nbeen found near the gene, each<br />\nmutation is associated with its<br />\nown<br />\nspecific<br />\npattern.<br />\nTherefore, no specific pattern<br />\ndefines the mutation as opposed to the normal gene, so each<br />\nfamily must be studied individually. Certain mutations are<br />\nmore prevalent than others. For<br />\ninstance, two particular mutations make up sixty to seventy<br />\npercent out of a total of fifteen<br />\nmutations which cause the<br />\ndisorder in the Mediterranean<br />\nbasin. The incidence of betathalassemia is particularly high<br />\nin this area. Prenatal diagnosis<br />\nin the United States is complicated because of the great<br />\nmixture of races; each ethnic<br />\ngroup has been found to have<br />\ndifferent sets of mutations.<br />\nCertain regions of the world<br />\nhave been found where betathalassemia results from one<br />\nl. selisl'isio<br /><br />\nops<br /><br />\noriginal mutation. This is called the Founder Effect. This<br />\nmeans all mutations are of a<br />\nsingle type. One of these<br />\nregions is the island of Sardinia<br />\nin the Mediterranean Sea where<br />\none out of every sixty couples<br />\nhas a twenty-five percent risk<br />\nwith each pregnancy of having<br />\nan affected child. Almost<br />\nninety-nine percent of these<br />\nThalassemias are from a single,<br />\noriginal mutation.<br />\nOverall, using DNA analysis,<br />\nKazazian's lab has been providing prenatal diagnosis for all<br />\nhemoglobinopathies since 1979.<br />\nThey have worked on 450 cases<br />\nso far: 250 for sickle cell<br />\nanemia, 105-110 for betathalassemia, and the rest for<br />\nother types of thalassemias.<br />\nMany other labs around the<br />\nworld are still using the old<br />\nmethod of fetal blood sampling<br />\nand hemoglobin analysis. These<br />\nlabs are mostly in Italy and<br />\nGreece, which on its own does<br />\nabout 500 cases a year. While<br />\nthese labs are incurring the<br />\nthree to four percent mortality<br />\nrate, the mortality rate for amniocentesis is only about one<br />\nper 500 fetuses. ,<br />\nA new technique called<br />\nChorion Villus Biopsy can be<br />\ndone much earlier in pregnancy at about 6-10 weeks as opposed to 16-18 weeks for amniocentesis. This could change<br />\nthe extent to which prenatal<br />\ndiagnosis is requested as many<br />\npeople find it distasteful to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester. Hopkins, so<br /><br />\nfar, has interpreted results from<br />\nabout 20 cases of hemoglobinopathies by this method.<br />\nFuture diagnosis is looking<br />\ntowards isolation of certain<br />\nchromosome abnormalities that<br />\nmay enhance susceptibility to<br />\ncarrying certain genetic<br />\ndisorders. Researchers would<br />\nalso like to learn about and find<br />\nmarkers for risk factors for all<br />\nkinds of common diseases. Carriers may have either a high or<br />\na low susceptibility.
