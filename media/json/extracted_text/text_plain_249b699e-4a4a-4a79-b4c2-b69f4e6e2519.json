Leaning thoughtfully on the<br />\nlong handle she looked out across the sloping<br />\nbarnyard, over the valley that swam in summer-haze to the blue hills beyond. Behind<br />\nthose hills was Mason and Dixon's line, which<br />\ntwo years of civil war had made bitterly significant as the boundary line ofslavery and rebelllion.<br />\nA turnpike that ran by the house and curled<br />\nround a knoll a little above it, showing at the<br />\nturn a last gleam of dusty white limestone, ran<br />\nstraight to those hills and on into the south.<br />\nFrom this same porch, at the beginning of the<br />\nwar, Dorothy had watched her two brothers<br />\nmarch away with the village company over that<br />\nturn of the road while the squeak of fifes and<br />\nthe rub-a-dub of Fent Johnson's drum sounded<br />\nacross the pasture. A year before that Frank<br />\nhad reined in his horse at the same spot to whve<br />\nhis hand to her befote he galloped away toward<br />\nVirginia.<br />\nEvery summer since he had left the village to<br />\nmake his home with a southern uncle, Frank<br />\nhad ridden across country to visit his relatives<br />\nin the little valley. Dorothy remembered how<br />\nin that year, the year her mother had died, they<br />\nwalked out in the moonlight the evening before<br />\nhis departure past the churchyard where the<br />\nstones looked like piles of shining snow, to the<br />\nold beech at the school-house with F. & D.<br />\ncarved in boyish jackknife cuts on its smooth<br />\nbark.<br />\nPerhaps he would never come again, thought<br />\nDorothy, now deep in reverie, remembering the<br />\n<br />\nNo.<br />\n<br />\nharsh words she had heard in his father's house<br />\nwhen the news spread through the neighborhood<br />\nthat Frank Walters had joined the rebel army.<br />\nDorothy's thoughts had strayed far from her<br />\nchurning and were wandering in troubled loyalty<br />\ninto the region south of the blue haze. Now her<br />\nreverie was broken rudely. Over the brow of<br />\nthe hill rode a horseman, then another, and a<br />\nthird ; and three Union scouts came at a tired<br />\ntrot down the road. Mr. Miller, Dorothy's<br />\nfather, was already at the gate, waiting to ask<br />\nfor news and to invite them in.<br />\nThe day before a warning had come that there<br />\nwas danger of a raid across the border, and prudent farmers had been hiding provisions and<br />\ndriving their cattle up into remote wood-lotsfor<br />\nsafety. Indeed, some had thought that Mr.<br />\nMiller himself was in danger, should the raiders<br />\ncome, for he had been known before the war as<br />\nan ardent and outspoken abolitionist and a<br />\nhelper of runaway slaves. Some alleged violations of the rights of non-combatants in the<br />\nSouth had given rise to vague threats against<br />\nhim that had reached his ears, but he was unwilling to leave his daughters alone, and so<br />\ngave little heed to his neighbors' advice to flee.<br />\nThe scouts brought news that a raiding party<br />\nwas out in force a few miles to the southwest<br />\nfollowing an uncertain course. They themselves<br />\nwere on their way to a point of vantage behind the town. One of their number held the<br />\nhorses ready for instant mounting, while his<br />\ncompanions laved their dusty faces at the pump<br />\nand sniffed savory odors of frying ham from the<br />\nkitchen. Little Jennie, Dorothy's sister, climbed<br />\nthe sheep-pasture hill from which she could see a<br />\nmile up the road, and stood sentinel while they<br />\nrested.<br />\nJust as Dorothy with wooden bowl and salt<br />\njar turned to go.to the spring-house, and black<br />\nSusan showed her shining face at the kitchen<br />\ndoor to say,\"Most ready, boys!\" Jennie came<br />\nrunning and screaming. The disappointed soldiers seized canteen and knapsack, tumbled into<br />\ntheir saddles, and were off in a moment.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nThey were hardly out of sight when the head<br />\nof a column of troopers with dingy gray uniforms<br />\nand slouch hats appeared at the turn of the road.<br />\nSusan dropped her kettles and pans and scrambled in ashen terror to a hiding place in the garret, for she was an escaped slave. Mr. Miller,<br />\nafter lingering almost too long,ran at Dorothy's<br />\nearnest entreaty to conceal himself in an empty<br />\ncorn-crib. A moment later the yard was full of<br />\nrebel soldiers, and a young officer was asking<br />\ncourteously enough for Mr. Miller.<br />\nDorothy, secretly wondering at his honest face<br />\nand easy manner, answered, \"I don't know<br />\nwhere he is, and I certainly should not tell you if<br />\nI did.\"<br />\nThe officer smiled.<br />\n\"I suppose a little fib is excusable under the<br />\ncircumstances,\" he said, \"but we feel pretty sure<br />\nhe's here. I must ask you to remain where you<br />\nare while my men search the place.\"<br />\nFrom her seat on the trellised stoop, Dorothy<br />\ncould see the door of the crib in which her father<br />\nwas hiding, and she watched it anxiously as a<br />\ndetail of men went toward the outbuildings.<br />\nThe next moment she was soothing Jennie, who<br />\nhad been startled into frightened screams by the<br />\nsudden appearance of a soldier in the room in<br />\nwhich she had taken refuge. The officer reassured them, and ordering a soldier to see that<br />\nthey were not molested, retired for a conference<br />\nwith his guides.<br />\nMeanwhile the search went on. It was orderly<br />\nenough at first; but the drink from a looted tavern had made the men reckless, and they were<br />\nsoon engaged in wanton pillage. Drawers and<br />\nchests were broken in search for valuables and<br />\ntheir contents strewed about. The searchers<br />\nspread devastation in the larder, and brought<br />\nruin to the kitchen, garden and spring-house.<br />\nDorothy gave little thought, however, to the<br />\nsounds of destruction about her. She was anxiously watching the corncrib. Her face paled a<br />\nlittle as she saw a tall raider enter the door and<br />\ndisappeared, within, and her heart sank in hopelessness. The crib was empty and the search<br />\nwas so thorough that there was no hope that<br />\nher father would not be seen.<br />\nPresently the soldier appeared again, alone,<br />\nslammed the door behind him and called to his<br />\n<br />\ncompanions. Dorothy looked in joyful wonder<br />\nas the searching party came leading a number of<br />\nhorses to report that Mr. Miller could not be<br />\nfound. She would have wondered no less had<br />\nshe been able to see what went on all this time<br />\nbehind the weather-stained boards of the crib.<br />\nThrough the cracks in the crib Mr. Miller had<br />\nwatched the soldiers and had heard drunken<br />\nthreats of \"hanging to the nearest tree.\" He<br />\nhad heard Jennie's scream, and filled with a horrible fear, he could hardly keep from rushing out,<br />\nhelpless as he was. Then the door had opened,<br />\nand a tall young raider walked to the hogshead<br />\nbehind which he was hiding and looked down<br />\nupon him. Mr. Miller rose to surrender himself,<br />\nwhen to his surprise the soldier pressed him<br />\ndown with, \"Keep still, man, keep still!\" Then<br />\nwalking quickly to the door he called to his companions, \"He's not in here, boys; come on, let's<br />\ngive it up!\" And the party went away leaving<br />\nMr. Miller surprised and puzzled at his strange<br />\nescape.<br />\nOld Susan's fear had sharpened her wits, and<br />\nthe search of the house had been equally fruitless.<br />\nDorothy stepped back into the doorway as the<br />\ntroopers crowded again into the yard and prepared to mount. Before her on the stoop Jennie<br />\nstill sobbed, and the house dog Plato at her feet<br />\ngrowled at the intruders. She heard a step in<br />\nthe hall behind her, and a strangely familiar<br />\nvoice said softly,\"Dorothy!\"<br />\nShe turned,startled,and saw a dusty,sunburned<br />\nsoldier. It was a moment before she recognized<br />\nhim.<br />\n\"Oh! Frank,\" she gasped, and she laid a restraining hand on Plato's nose.<br />\n\"Hush,\" said he, they mustn't see me talking<br />\nto you. Tell your father to get out of that crib<br />\ninto the woods,for we're coming to look for him<br />\nagain. Don't forget me, Dorothy. Good bye!\"<br />\nThen he walked rapidly out past her and<br />\njoined his comrades. The soldiers lingered a moment caring for their horses, and then at a few<br />\nsharp words of command,with a rattle of accouterments and a thunder of hoofs the column disappeared behind a cloud of dust on its way<br />\ndown the valley.<br />\nNext day the raiders came back on their way<br />\nsouth. Both Mr. Miller and Susan had found<br />\n<br />\n;f<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsafer hiding places, and wisely; for a squad of<br />\ntroopers had surrounded the house at night<br />\nthinking he might return.<br />\nDorothy stood in the door to watch the long<br />\nprocession go by. First came a great herd of<br />\ncattle and a string of captured horses, and then<br />\nthe long column of soldiers laden with all sorts<br />\nof plunder. Her glance singled out a trooper in<br />\ntattered gray who dared give her only a look or<br />\nrecognition. At the bend in the road he turned<br />\nin his saddle to look back,and then the dust hid<br />\nhim from her sight. She watched till the column<br />\ndisappeared over the hill, and with a little song<br />\non her lips, turned again to her work.<br />\nF.<br />\nsr Of OF<br />\n<br />\nTHE ANNUAL FEED.<br />\nfourth annual \"Feed,\" held to celebrate<br />\nTHEHopkins<br />\nathletic victories, proved a decided success. One cause of this was the fact that<br />\ncertain novelties were inserted in the programme<br />\nwhich, heretofore, has consisted chiefly of burlesque athletic \"stunts,\" as sack-races and<br />\nchicken-fights. Friday night's exhibition dispensed with these hackneyed pastimes, and while<br />\nmuscle received its proper place in the exercises,<br />\nart and science were also encouraged. Musical<br />\nart, in the \"Submarine Band ;\" figurative art,<br />\nin the living picures; and decorative art, in the<br />\nblackened-glove contest: science,in the hypnotic<br />\nexhibition. These inovations emanated chiefly<br />\nfrom the resourceful brains of Billy Maddren<br />\nand Physical Director Mackdermott.<br />\nThe programme opened with speeches by Dr.<br />\nRemsen, President Gilman and Dean Griffin. Dr.<br />\nRemsen recounted the athletic achievements of<br />\nHopkins during the past year. Dr. Gilman in<br />\nhis address told the audience how he once informed a delegation of Harvard professors that<br />\nthe honor of having H. U. after one's name was<br />\ngreatly increased by prefixing a j.<br />\nThe surprise of the evening was sprung upon<br />\nthe audience when Boozer's Submarine Band,<br />\nclad in white duck, and barten<br />\npardon<br />\nus, we mean white jackets, filed out upon the<br />\nstage. Then the house was served up a rich<br />\nmusical treat. Instrumental solos and trios, interspersed with full orchestra (later the orches-<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ntra was fuller) pieces were encored again and<br />\nagain. The Dean said: \"Never has music moved<br />\nme so before,\" while we observed that President<br />\nGilman was even further moved\u2014(all the way<br />\nout of the building). The living pictures were,<br />\nfor the most part, of a strictly moral nature,<br />\nwith the exception of one, concerning which,<br />\nAnthony Comstock, and the anti-vice crusaders<br />\nmight have taken issue.<br />\nPete Moore posed as the Greek discus thrower,<br />\nand it is a pity some of his fair admirers could<br />\nnot have heheld him clad in spotless white.<br />\n\"Abbie,\" as the Lacrosse Player; Hoffman<br />\nand England, as the Runners; and Sayler, as<br />\nthe Foot-ball Player, were loudly applauded.<br />\nHaughton was \"a perket lady.\" HiS Carmencita \"stunt\" was excellently rendered, and if he<br />\ncan get into shape WC would advise him to start<br />\nin life as a chorus-girl. When he appeared on the<br />\nstage several students in the audience were<br />\nheard to remark : \"Is'nt she natural; looks ex;\" but here the Boozer band<br />\nactly like<br />\ndrowned the name. The Hopkins Banjo Club<br />\nfurnished some admirable \"ragtime\" music,<br />\nand then Maddren kept everyone interested in<br />\nan exhibition of hypnotism. This was the feature of the evening. After putting his negro<br />\nsubjects through all manner of odd tricks, he<br />\ndemonstrated the genuineness of the performance<br />\nby allowing one of the audience to stick a pin<br />\ninto the hand of a hypnotised person without<br />\ncausing the latter any pain. Mr. Maddren has<br />\nbeen studying the subject of hypnotism about<br />\nfour months, and in that short time has become<br />\nrather familiar with it, as was demonstrated<br />\nFriday night.<br />\nNext, the crowd adjourned to the cage and<br />\nwatched Zaza and Sapho, otherwise Snowden<br />\nand Hopper,decorate each othar's anatomy with<br />\ncharcoal. There was not time to weigh out the<br />\namount of charcoal deposited on each, so the<br />\nmatch was called a draw.<br />\nIn an exciting,three-heat obstacle race, Winternitz came off victorious. Owing to the lateness<br />\nof the hour the tug-of-war between the Junior<br />\nand Freshman classes was called off. \"Back to<br />\nthe Gym\" was the signal then given, and there<br />\nthe \"feed,\" consisting of chicken-salad, rolls,<br />\nice cream, cake and coffee was served.<br />\n<br />\nPRESS OF ISTONEBRAKER BROS., BALTIMORE.<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntbe 14ews.Zetter.<br />\n<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year<br />\nStudents Of THE JOHNS<br />\n<br />\nby the<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nFEBRUARY 7, 1901.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per<br />\n<br />\nEditor in Chief,<br />\n<br />\nyear.<br />\n<br />\nJo cents a single copy.<br />\nNORMAN HOVER, 1901.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nJOHN M.

Everything<br />\nwent off smoothly and pleasantly, and there<br />\nwas not a hitch. The orderly way in which the<br />\nentertainment proceeded in every respect was in<br />\ndelightful contrast to some of the bargain-counter rushes that have been witnessed in past<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe Feed was undoubtedly the best that has<br />\never been given, and it is to be hoped that the<br />\nfinancial success will be as great as the artistic,<br />\nThe Committee showed much originality in their<br />\nselection of attractive features of entertainment,<br />\nand great credit is due Messrs.

Johns<br />\nHopkins University, planted on the sloping side<br />\nof a hill amid surrounding dwellings and busy<br />\ntrade, and an open campus with space for all<br />\nkinds of games and the additional charm of practical ownership seem too mutually foreign ever<br />\nto have ary real connection. But if the negotiations at present under way do not fail, another season will see us in practical possession<br />\nof a lacrosse and foot-ball field with suitable<br />\naccommodations for track and field sports.<br />\nThis will without doubt be the greatest step<br />\ntaken in athletics in years, perhaps the greatest<br />\nthat we have ever taken at one time. The building of the cage was a great achievement, and<br />\none that was in the highest degree appreciated,<br />\nbut that was recognized as but a preliminary<br />\nstep to the acquisition of an outdoor practice<br />\nground. The list of athletic victories for 1900<br />\nthat was announced at the feed on Friday was<br />\na remarkable one for a city university. With a<br />\npermanent field at hand, the list for 1901 should<br />\nbe still better, and doubtless Director Mackdermott expects it to be. The credit for this admirable move is, indeed, due mainly to Mr.<br />\nMackdermott, and is only one of the many<br />\nimprovements that have been instituted under<br />\nhis regime.<br />\noir 9r fr<br />\n<br />\nA GAIN AND A LOSS.<br />\nJust as we are going to press comes the news<br />\nthat a great tract of over 150 acres of valuable<br />\nland on Charles Street Avenue has been offered<br />\nas a gift to the University, with the understanding that at such time as the circumstances shall<br />\npermit, tile University shall be established permanently upon that site. The condition attached<br />\nto the gift is that the sum of $1,000,000 shall be<br />\nraised lw other friends of the University in order<br />\nto enable it to carry out the plan of removal.<br />\nThe trustees expect to be able to raise the sum<br />\nwithout difficulty.

Mr. Mackdermott says he does not<br />\nknow where this article originated,as the matter<br />\nwas to be kept a profound secret until his plans<br />\nwere fully matured; but since he has been anticipated by the newspaper, he adds that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Athletic Association has been incorporated, and that we are to have a share in<br />\nthe new baseball grounds which are about to be<br />\nestablished by the American League Base-ball<br />\nClub. The new grounds will be a short distance<br />\nfrom Union Park\u2014York Road and 29th Street,<br />\nand will have the same seating capacity as the<br />\n01(1.

Because the Hopkins University is situated in the heart of the city, surrounded on all<br />\nsides by dwellings, with not the least excuse for a<br />\ncampus, and second, because we have no dormitory life. When an athletic field is secured, it is<br />\nto be hoped that these obstacles will be done<br />\naway with to a great extent, and there is no<br />\nreason whyHopkins,after securing these grounds,<br />\ncannot shove her athletic teams to the front,<br />\nand put them on a level with those of other<br />\nprominent universities and colleges in the country. It might be well to say that this attempt<br />\nat securing outing grounds may be solely attrib-<br />\n<br />\nuted to Mr. Mackdermott's unrelaxing interest<br />\nin Hopkins athletics, and if the grounds are obtained, it will be another step onward toward<br />\nthe goal which \"Mac\"and our teams deserve to<br />\nreach.<br />\n<br />\nATHLETIC NOTES.<br />\nschedule has been arranged<br />\nTHEforfollowing<br />\nthe championship series of foot-ball<br />\ngames for the season 1901-1902:<br />\nNov. 9th.\u2014St. John's vs.Western Maryland, at<br />\nWestminster.<br />\nNov. 16th.\u2014Johns Hopkins vs. St. John's, at<br />\nBaltimore.<br />\nNov.-23rd.\u2014Johns Hopkins vs. Western Maryland, at Baltimore.<br />\ngir 9r or<br />\nThe contest for the tennis championship of<br />\nthe Maryland Intercollegiate association will be<br />\nheld in the Hopkins cage on Wednesday, May<br />\n15th, at 10 A.

The list includes Mr. Eugene Levering on<br />\n\"A Business Career ;\" Dean Griffin on \"Teaching as a Life Work ;\" Mr. Niles on \"Law as a<br />\nProfession ;\"and Dr. Kelly on \"The Doctor of<br />\nthe Future.\" Others will be announced later.<br />\nIt is the purpose of the committee to conduct<br />\neight meetings on this plan, after which the Sunday afternoon services will be discontinued for<br />\nthe year. Five o'clock on Sunday for forty-five<br />\nminutes, is the time.<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\nCLASSES.<br />\nTwenty-five members of the Y. M. C. A. are<br />\nstudying the Bible in three classes meeting<br />\nweekly.<br />\nMr. A. IL Ewing has been conducting a class<br />\nof a dozen men in the study of modern conditions in missions. The class will be continued<br />\nfor several weeks, although Mr. Ewing will sail<br />\nfor India the last of this month, directly after<br />\ntaking his degree of Ph. D. He will resume his<br />\nmissionary work, his station being at Allahabad.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n[CONTINUED FROM PAGE G.]<br />\n<br />\nhad been, but any one who this year heard \"Salome\"<br />\ncould not fail to notice the expression and feeling<br />\nthat the men themselves had for the more modulated<br />\nstrains. In the other pieces there is -less expression<br />\nthan in this, on account of their being marches.<br />\nThe Banjo Club, in my opinion, deserves the most<br />\npraise, for they entered the year handicapped in numbers, and disheartened by their former record. But<br />\nnow we undoubtedly have a club that rivals that of<br />\nPrinceton, and this year, if proper training is kept tip<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Clubs will show the Princeton<br />\nmen that all three clubs are better than theirs.<br />\nBut enough of praise: for I must come to the main<br />\nreason for writing this letter, and that is to offer a<br />\nfew suggestions. They are all of minor significance,<br />\nhut still effect, to a certain degree at least, the opinion that the audience has of the clubs. To begin<br />\nwith, there should be more system in the manner in<br />\nwhich the men come upon the stage. Usually they<br />\nstraggle in, slowly form a crooked line, and then,<br />\nsomeone finding himself in the wrong place, there is<br />\nmore commotion. This of course does not always<br />\ntake place in just the manner described, hut there is<br />\nan air of uncertainty in all the clubs, especially the<br />\nGlee Club, which impresses the audience most unfavorably. Then too, the leader almost invariably<br />\nhas difficulty in gaining the attention of his club in<br />\norder to start the piece. ):'et for hint to start before<br />\nall the mei are looking at hint, would bring about a<br />\nweak beginning and mar the whole selection. For<br />\nthe old adage \"work well begun is half done,\"is most<br />\nsurely applicable to Musical Clubs also. And now I<br />\nwould like to offer a suggestion, concerning the too<br />\nfrequent use of the pistol. One explosion, or perhaps<br />\ntwo, is startling and has a good effect, but more than<br />\nthis only tend to make the concert like a cheap vaudeville, where the attention of the audience has to be<br />\ngained by some such artificial means. The question<br />\nas to the number of encores that should be given is<br />\none of some importance, for too many are apt to tire<br />\nthe audience, and too few give the impression that<br />\nthe clubs have a small repertoire. In the Baltimore<br />\ncencert, too many were given, and the hearers were<br />\nall fatigued at the close of the programme. The number of encores is, of course, at the descretion of the<br />\nleaders, and they should not be carried away by the<br />\nenthusiasm of the men, but should wait for sufficient<br />\napplause.<br />\nAnd now with these last few suggestions I will<br />\nclose, with most earnest wishes for the continued<br />\nsuccess of the clubs.<br />\nYours very truly,<br />\nA HOPKINS MUSIC LOVER<br />\nWW W<br />\n<br />\nInvention.\u2014A rubber stamp to be used on domestic letters has been invented by The Widow<br />\n(Cornell) staff, and saves time, ink, and won-y.<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\nAnswers to examinations given in one of the<br />\nleading grammar schools of Boston:<br />\nWho were the Pilgrims?<br />\nA dirty, funny set, who lived under the earth.<br />\nName a domestic animal useful for clothing,<br />\nand describe its habits?<br />\nThe ox.

Leaning thoughtfully on the<br />\nlong handle she looked out across the sloping<br />\nbarnyard, over the valley that swam in summer-haze to the blue hills beyond. Behind<br />\nthose hills was Mason and Dixon's line, which<br />\ntwo years of civil war had made bitterly significant as the boundary line ofslavery and rebelllion.<br />\nA turnpike that ran by the house and curled<br />\nround a knoll a little above it, showing at the<br />\nturn a last gleam of dusty white limestone, ran<br />\nstraight to those hills and on into the south.<br />\nFrom this same porch, at the beginning of the<br />\nwar, Dorothy had watched her two brothers<br />\nmarch away with the village company over that<br />\nturn of the road while the squeak of fifes and<br />\nthe rub-a-dub of Fent Johnson's drum sounded<br />\nacross the pasture. A year before that Frank<br />\nhad reined in his horse at the same spot to whve<br />\nhis hand to her befote he galloped away toward<br />\nVirginia.<br />\nEvery summer since he had left the village to<br />\nmake his home with a southern uncle, Frank<br />\nhad ridden across country to visit his relatives<br />\nin the little valley. Dorothy remembered how<br />\nin that year, the year her mother had died, they<br />\nwalked out in the moonlight the evening before<br />\nhis departure past the churchyard where the<br />\nstones looked like piles of shining snow, to the<br />\nold beech at the school-house with F. &amp; D.<br />\ncarved in boyish jackknife cuts on its smooth<br />\nbark.<br />\nPerhaps he would never come again, thought<br />\nDorothy, now deep in reverie, remembering the<br /><br />\nNo.<br /><br />\nharsh words she had heard in his father's house<br />\nwhen the news spread through the neighborhood<br />\nthat Frank Walters had joined the rebel army.<br />\nDorothy's thoughts had strayed far from her<br />\nchurning and were wandering in troubled loyalty<br />\ninto the region south of the blue haze. Now her<br />\nreverie was broken rudely. Over the brow of<br />\nthe hill rode a horseman, then another, and a<br />\nthird ; and three Union scouts came at a tired<br />\ntrot down the road. Mr. Miller, Dorothy's<br />\nfather, was already at the gate, waiting to ask<br />\nfor news and to invite them in.<br />\nThe day before a warning had come that there<br />\nwas danger of a raid across the border, and prudent farmers had been hiding provisions and<br />\ndriving their cattle up into remote wood-lotsfor<br />\nsafety. Indeed, some had thought that Mr.<br />\nMiller himself was in danger, should the raiders<br />\ncome, for he had been known before the war as<br />\nan ardent and outspoken abolitionist and a<br />\nhelper of runaway slaves. Some alleged violations of the rights of non-combatants in the<br />\nSouth had given rise to vague threats against<br />\nhim that had reached his ears, but he was unwilling to leave his daughters alone, and so<br />\ngave little heed to his neighbors' advice to flee.<br />\nThe scouts brought news that a raiding party<br />\nwas out in force a few miles to the southwest<br />\nfollowing an uncertain course. They themselves<br />\nwere on their way to a point of vantage behind the town. One of their number held the<br />\nhorses ready for instant mounting, while his<br />\ncompanions laved their dusty faces at the pump<br />\nand sniffed savory odors of frying ham from the<br />\nkitchen. Little Jennie, Dorothy's sister, climbed<br />\nthe sheep-pasture hill from which she could see a<br />\nmile up the road, and stood sentinel while they<br />\nrested.<br />\nJust as Dorothy with wooden bowl and salt<br />\njar turned to go.to the spring-house, and black<br />\nSusan showed her shining face at the kitchen<br />\ndoor to say,\"Most ready, boys!\" Jennie came<br />\nrunning and screaming. The disappointed soldiers seized canteen and knapsack, tumbled into<br />\ntheir saddles, and were off in a moment.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nThey were hardly out of sight when the head<br />\nof a column of troopers with dingy gray uniforms<br />\nand slouch hats appeared at the turn of the road.<br />\nSusan dropped her kettles and pans and scrambled in ashen terror to a hiding place in the garret, for she was an escaped slave. Mr. Miller,<br />\nafter lingering almost too long,ran at Dorothy's<br />\nearnest entreaty to conceal himself in an empty<br />\ncorn-crib. A moment later the yard was full of<br />\nrebel soldiers, and a young officer was asking<br />\ncourteously enough for Mr. Miller.<br />\nDorothy, secretly wondering at his honest face<br />\nand easy manner, answered, \"I don't know<br />\nwhere he is, and I certainly should not tell you if<br />\nI did.\"<br />\nThe officer smiled.<br />\n\"I suppose a little fib is excusable under the<br />\ncircumstances,\" he said, \"but we feel pretty sure<br />\nhe's here. I must ask you to remain where you<br />\nare while my men search the place.\"<br />\nFrom her seat on the trellised stoop, Dorothy<br />\ncould see the door of the crib in which her father<br />\nwas hiding, and she watched it anxiously as a<br />\ndetail of men went toward the outbuildings.<br />\nThe next moment she was soothing Jennie, who<br />\nhad been startled into frightened screams by the<br />\nsudden appearance of a soldier in the room in<br />\nwhich she had taken refuge. The officer reassured them, and ordering a soldier to see that<br />\nthey were not molested, retired for a conference<br />\nwith his guides.<br />\nMeanwhile the search went on. It was orderly<br />\nenough at first; but the drink from a looted tavern had made the men reckless, and they were<br />\nsoon engaged in wanton pillage. Drawers and<br />\nchests were broken in search for valuables and<br />\ntheir contents strewed about. The searchers<br />\nspread devastation in the larder, and brought<br />\nruin to the kitchen, garden and spring-house.<br />\nDorothy gave little thought, however, to the<br />\nsounds of destruction about her. She was anxiously watching the corncrib. Her face paled a<br />\nlittle as she saw a tall raider enter the door and<br />\ndisappeared, within, and her heart sank in hopelessness. The crib was empty and the search<br />\nwas so thorough that there was no hope that<br />\nher father would not be seen.<br />\nPresently the soldier appeared again, alone,<br />\nslammed the door behind him and called to his<br /><br />\ncompanions. Dorothy looked in joyful wonder<br />\nas the searching party came leading a number of<br />\nhorses to report that Mr. Miller could not be<br />\nfound. She would have wondered no less had<br />\nshe been able to see what went on all this time<br />\nbehind the weather-stained boards of the crib.<br />\nThrough the cracks in the crib Mr. Miller had<br />\nwatched the soldiers and had heard drunken<br />\nthreats of \"hanging to the nearest tree.\" He<br />\nhad heard Jennie's scream, and filled with a horrible fear, he could hardly keep from rushing out,<br />\nhelpless as he was. Then the door had opened,<br />\nand a tall young raider walked to the hogshead<br />\nbehind which he was hiding and looked down<br />\nupon him. Mr. Miller rose to surrender himself,<br />\nwhen to his surprise the soldier pressed him<br />\ndown with, \"Keep still, man, keep still!\" Then<br />\nwalking quickly to the door he called to his companions, \"He's not in here, boys; come on, let's<br />\ngive it up!\" And the party went away leaving<br />\nMr. Miller surprised and puzzled at his strange<br />\nescape.<br />\nOld Susan's fear had sharpened her wits, and<br />\nthe search of the house had been equally fruitless.<br />\nDorothy stepped back into the doorway as the<br />\ntroopers crowded again into the yard and prepared to mount. Before her on the stoop Jennie<br />\nstill sobbed, and the house dog Plato at her feet<br />\ngrowled at the intruders. She heard a step in<br />\nthe hall behind her, and a strangely familiar<br />\nvoice said softly,\"Dorothy!\"<br />\nShe turned,startled,and saw a dusty,sunburned<br />\nsoldier. It was a moment before she recognized<br />\nhim.<br />\n\"Oh! Frank,\" she gasped, and she laid a restraining hand on Plato's nose.<br />\n\"Hush,\" said he, they mustn't see me talking<br />\nto you. Tell your father to get out of that crib<br />\ninto the woods,for we're coming to look for him<br />\nagain. Don't forget me, Dorothy. Good bye!\"<br />\nThen he walked rapidly out past her and<br />\njoined his comrades. The soldiers lingered a moment caring for their horses, and then at a few<br />\nsharp words of command,with a rattle of accouterments and a thunder of hoofs the column disappeared behind a cloud of dust on its way<br />\ndown the valley.<br />\nNext day the raiders came back on their way<br />\nsouth. Both Mr. Miller and Susan had found<br /><br />\n;f<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsafer hiding places, and wisely; for a squad of<br />\ntroopers had surrounded the house at night<br />\nthinking he might return.<br />\nDorothy stood in the door to watch the long<br />\nprocession go by. First came a great herd of<br />\ncattle and a string of captured horses, and then<br />\nthe long column of soldiers laden with all sorts<br />\nof plunder. Her glance singled out a trooper in<br />\ntattered gray who dared give her only a look or<br />\nrecognition. At the bend in the road he turned<br />\nin his saddle to look back,and then the dust hid<br />\nhim from her sight. She watched till the column<br />\ndisappeared over the hill, and with a little song<br />\non her lips, turned again to her work.<br />\nF.<br />\nsr Of OF<br /><br />\nTHE ANNUAL FEED.<br />\nfourth annual \"Feed,\" held to celebrate<br />\nTHEHopkins<br />\nathletic victories, proved a decided success. One cause of this was the fact that<br />\ncertain novelties were inserted in the programme<br />\nwhich, heretofore, has consisted chiefly of burlesque athletic \"stunts,\" as sack-races and<br />\nchicken-fights. Friday night's exhibition dispensed with these hackneyed pastimes, and while<br />\nmuscle received its proper place in the exercises,<br />\nart and science were also encouraged. Musical<br />\nart, in the \"Submarine Band ;\" figurative art,<br />\nin the living picures; and decorative art, in the<br />\nblackened-glove contest: science,in the hypnotic<br />\nexhibition. These inovations emanated chiefly<br />\nfrom the resourceful brains of Billy Maddren<br />\nand Physical Director Mackdermott.<br />\nThe programme opened with speeches by Dr.<br />\nRemsen, President Gilman and Dean Griffin. Dr.<br />\nRemsen recounted the athletic achievements of<br />\nHopkins during the past year. Dr. Gilman in<br />\nhis address told the audience how he once informed a delegation of Harvard professors that<br />\nthe honor of having H. U. after one's name was<br />\ngreatly increased by prefixing a j.<br />\nThe surprise of the evening was sprung upon<br />\nthe audience when Boozer's Submarine Band,<br />\nclad in white duck, and barten<br />\npardon<br />\nus, we mean white jackets, filed out upon the<br />\nstage. Then the house was served up a rich<br />\nmusical treat. Instrumental solos and trios, interspersed with full orchestra (later the orches-<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ntra was fuller) pieces were encored again and<br />\nagain. The Dean said: \"Never has music moved<br />\nme so before,\" while we observed that President<br />\nGilman was even further moved\u2014(all the way<br />\nout of the building). The living pictures were,<br />\nfor the most part, of a strictly moral nature,<br />\nwith the exception of one, concerning which,<br />\nAnthony Comstock, and the anti-vice crusaders<br />\nmight have taken issue.<br />\nPete Moore posed as the Greek discus thrower,<br />\nand it is a pity some of his fair admirers could<br />\nnot have heheld him clad in spotless white.<br />\n\"Abbie,\" as the Lacrosse Player; Hoffman<br />\nand England, as the Runners; and Sayler, as<br />\nthe Foot-ball Player, were loudly applauded.<br />\nHaughton was \"a perket lady.\" HiS Carmencita \"stunt\" was excellently rendered, and if he<br />\ncan get into shape WC would advise him to start<br />\nin life as a chorus-girl. When he appeared on the<br />\nstage several students in the audience were<br />\nheard to remark : \"Is'nt she natural; looks ex;\" but here the Boozer band<br />\nactly like<br />\ndrowned the name. The Hopkins Banjo Club<br />\nfurnished some admirable \"ragtime\" music,<br />\nand then Maddren kept everyone interested in<br />\nan exhibition of hypnotism. This was the feature of the evening. After putting his negro<br />\nsubjects through all manner of odd tricks, he<br />\ndemonstrated the genuineness of the performance<br />\nby allowing one of the audience to stick a pin<br />\ninto the hand of a hypnotised person without<br />\ncausing the latter any pain. Mr. Maddren has<br />\nbeen studying the subject of hypnotism about<br />\nfour months, and in that short time has become<br />\nrather familiar with it, as was demonstrated<br />\nFriday night.<br />\nNext, the crowd adjourned to the cage and<br />\nwatched Zaza and Sapho, otherwise Snowden<br />\nand Hopper,decorate each othar's anatomy with<br />\ncharcoal. There was not time to weigh out the<br />\namount of charcoal deposited on each, so the<br />\nmatch was called a draw.<br />\nIn an exciting,three-heat obstacle race, Winternitz came off victorious. Owing to the lateness<br />\nof the hour the tug-of-war between the Junior<br />\nand Freshman classes was called off. \"Back to<br />\nthe Gym\" was the signal then given, and there<br />\nthe \"feed,\" consisting of chicken-salad, rolls,<br />\nice cream, cake and coffee was served.<br /><br />\nPRESS OF ISTONEBRAKER BROS., BALTIMORE.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\ntbe 14ews.Zetter.<br /><br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year<br />\nStudents Of THE JOHNS<br /><br />\nby the<br /><br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nFEBRUARY 7, 1901.<br />\n\u2022<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per<br /><br />\nEditor in Chief,<br /><br />\nyear.<br /><br />\nJo cents a single copy.<br />\nNORMAN HOVER, 1901.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nJOHN M.

Everything<br />\nwent off smoothly and pleasantly, and there<br />\nwas not a hitch. The orderly way in which the<br />\nentertainment proceeded in every respect was in<br />\ndelightful contrast to some of the bargain-counter rushes that have been witnessed in past<br />\nyears.<br />\nThe Feed was undoubtedly the best that has<br />\never been given, and it is to be hoped that the<br />\nfinancial success will be as great as the artistic,<br />\nThe Committee showed much originality in their<br />\nselection of attractive features of entertainment,<br />\nand great credit is due Messrs.

Johns<br />\nHopkins University, planted on the sloping side<br />\nof a hill amid surrounding dwellings and busy<br />\ntrade, and an open campus with space for all<br />\nkinds of games and the additional charm of practical ownership seem too mutually foreign ever<br />\nto have ary real connection. But if the negotiations at present under way do not fail, another season will see us in practical possession<br />\nof a lacrosse and foot-ball field with suitable<br />\naccommodations for track and field sports.<br />\nThis will without doubt be the greatest step<br />\ntaken in athletics in years, perhaps the greatest<br />\nthat we have ever taken at one time. The building of the cage was a great achievement, and<br />\none that was in the highest degree appreciated,<br />\nbut that was recognized as but a preliminary<br />\nstep to the acquisition of an outdoor practice<br />\nground. The list of athletic victories for 1900<br />\nthat was announced at the feed on Friday was<br />\na remarkable one for a city university. With a<br />\npermanent field at hand, the list for 1901 should<br />\nbe still better, and doubtless Director Mackdermott expects it to be. The credit for this admirable move is, indeed, due mainly to Mr.<br />\nMackdermott, and is only one of the many<br />\nimprovements that have been instituted under<br />\nhis regime.<br />\noir 9r fr<br /><br />\nA GAIN AND A LOSS.<br />\nJust as we are going to press comes the news<br />\nthat a great tract of over 150 acres of valuable<br />\nland on Charles Street Avenue has been offered<br />\nas a gift to the University, with the understanding that at such time as the circumstances shall<br />\npermit, tile University shall be established permanently upon that site.

Mr. Mackdermott says he does not<br />\nknow where this article originated,as the matter<br />\nwas to be kept a profound secret until his plans<br />\nwere fully matured; but since he has been anticipated by the newspaper, he adds that the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Athletic Association has been incorporated, and that we are to have a share in<br />\nthe new baseball grounds which are about to be<br />\nestablished by the American League Base-ball<br />\nClub. The new grounds will be a short distance<br />\nfrom Union Park\u2014York Road and 29th Street,<br />\nand will have the same seating capacity as the<br />\n01(1.

Because the Hopkins University is situated in the heart of the city, surrounded on all<br />\nsides by dwellings, with not the least excuse for a<br />\ncampus, and second, because we have no dormitory life. When an athletic field is secured, it is<br />\nto be hoped that these obstacles will be done<br />\naway with to a great extent, and there is no<br />\nreason whyHopkins,after securing these grounds,<br />\ncannot shove her athletic teams to the front,<br />\nand put them on a level with those of other<br />\nprominent universities and colleges in the country.

They are all of minor significance,<br />\nhut still effect, to a certain degree at least, the opinion that the audience has of the clubs. To begin<br />\nwith, there should be more system in the manner in<br />\nwhich the men come upon the stage. Usually they<br />\nstraggle in, slowly form a crooked line, and then,<br />\nsomeone finding himself in the wrong place, there is<br />\nmore commotion. This of course does not always<br />\ntake place in just the manner described, hut there is<br />\nan air of uncertainty in all the clubs, especially the<br />\nGlee Club, which impresses the audience most unfavorably. Then too, the leader almost invariably<br />\nhas difficulty in gaining the attention of his club in<br />\norder to start the piece. ):'et for hint to start before<br />\nall the mei are looking at hint, would bring about a<br />\nweak beginning and mar the whole selection. For<br />\nthe old adage \"work well begun is half done,\"is most<br />\nsurely applicable to Musical Clubs also. And now I<br />\nwould like to offer a suggestion, concerning the too<br />\nfrequent use of the pistol. One explosion, or perhaps<br />\ntwo, is startling and has a good effect, but more than<br />\nthis only tend to make the concert like a cheap vaudeville, where the attention of the audience has to be<br />\ngained by some such artificial means. The question<br />\nas to the number of encores that should be given is<br />\none of some importance, for too many are apt to tire<br />\nthe audience, and too few give the impression that<br />\nthe clubs have a small repertoire.
