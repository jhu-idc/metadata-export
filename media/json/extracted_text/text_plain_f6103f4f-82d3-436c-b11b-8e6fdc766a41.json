CONSIDINE<br />\nYou really wonder, after a<br />\nwhile, why it is that the politics<br />\nof student activities are so<br />\nimportant to some people. It<br />\nobviously isn't a reflection of<br />\ngeneral student interest, as most<br />\nelection results will plainly<br />\nindicate. It seems More likely<br />\nthat student politics exists<br />\nsolely for the use and<br />\nenjoyment of stadent<br />\npoliticians.<br />\nTake the SAC, for example.<br />\nThe SAC meets about twice<br />\nyearly, so it seems an unlikely<br />\nspawning ground for political<br />\npower plays. When they met<br />\nTuesday,it- was merely to vote<br />\non budget appropriations. Ron<br />\nBialek expected nothing less,<br />\nand not \u2022 much more, and most<br />\nmembers were hoping to get<br />\nthrough the meeting in as little<br />\ntime as possible.<br />\nAs these things go, however,<br />\none group generallywantsmore<br />\nmoney than it had been<br />\nofferred. In this case,it was the<br />\nBarnstormers; they needed the<br />\nmoney to run 'plays in<br />\n.ShriverHall, since it seemed that<br />\nthey would have no other<br />\nsuitable alternative hall. Fine.<br />\nBut where does the money<br />\ncome from?<br />\nIn steps \"Big Stu\" Davidson.<br />\nNow, personally, aside from the<br />\ngeneral aversion I have to<br />\npoliticians with folksy<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\ncouncil asked for (and got) an,<br />\nextra two hundred dollars,<br />\nwhich was ,snatched from the<br />\nFlying Monkey appropriation.<br />\n(Just off the cuff, though, Ron<br />\nBialek felt that Flying Monkey<br />\ncould easily get an extra two<br />\nhundred from the Social<br />\nCommittee budget, of which<br />\nboth Flying Monkey and Fine<br />\nArts are subsidiaries).<br />\nOn the whole, those who<br />\ncame to the meeting with<br />\npurely budgetary concerns left<br />\nbasically satisfied, if somewhat<br />\nirritated by the length of the<br />\nmeeting. But the politicos left<br />\ngenerally disappointed. Sure,<br />\nthey had flexed their muscles,<br />\nbut the big prize had eluded<br />\nthem; they were unable to<br />\nprove their power to be<br />\nultimately greater than that of<br />\ntheir adversary. Just as well,<br />\nthough, since an appetite for<br />\npower is only made bigger by<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nAt least they can't cry that<br />\nthe News-Letter has ignored<br />\nthem. Some one once remarked<br />\nthat they disliked voting,<br />\nbecause \"it only seemed to<br />\nencourage them.\" The same can<br />\nbe held with regard to political<br />\nreporting. Still, if one wished to<br />\ndestroy the political credibility<br />\nof some of these clowns, all<br />\nthat would be necessary would<br />\nbe to print a verbatim transcript<br />\nof an SAC meeting.<br />\n<br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nWilliam Proxmire, a United States :senator since 1957 (when he<br />\nfilled the seat vacated by Joe McCarthy) is a powerful man in his<br />\nhome state of Wisconsin, continually reelected by huge majorities, and<br />\nin Congress, where he is chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban<br />\nAffairs committee. Speaking here Tuesday night, Proxmire stated that<br />\nmany of his fellow Democrats are reluctant to'recognize the giantism<br />\nof the federal government. As an example of how rapidly our<br />\nbureaucracy is expanding, Proxmire cited the Department of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare, whose total budget has risen from 7 billion<br />\ndollars in 1965 go 56 billion dollars in 1977. \"We can't solve our<br />\nproblems simply by appropriating money,\" said Proxmire. \"There is a<br />\ncavalier disregard for the value of the dollar.\"<br />\nDisturbed by the squandering of tax money, Proxmire established<br />\nhis Golden Fleece Award, in 1975. The award bestows recognition on<br />\nthe most outraseous federal expenditures. Past recipients include the<br />\nNational Science Foundation, for spending $84,000 on an attempt to<br />\ndetermine \"Why People Fall in iLove\"; the FAA, for taking 75<br />\nmeasurements of airline stewardesses :at a cost of $57,000; and a<br />\n$103,000 study of whether sunfish that drink tequila are more<br />\naggressive than sunfish that drink gin. The Navy estimated that the<br />\ncost of furnishing the vice-presidential house would be $15,000, but<br />\nwhen it actually cost $500,000, Proxmire felt an award was merited.<br />\nThe mansion's resident, Nelson Rockefeller, was not pleased to receive<br />\nhis Golden Fleece Award, stormed into Proxmire's office and<br />\ncomplained: \"Bill, you shouldn't have given me the award. I don't<br />\neven live in that house.\"<br />\nAs the bureaucracy has grown, taxes have risen. The average citizen,<br />\naccording to Proxmire, paid 10% of his income in local,state and<br />\nnational taxes in 1930, 20% in 1940, and pays 37% at the present<br />\ntime. Almost every politician, Proxmire included, favors holding down<br />\nthe size of government and keeping taxes from rising, but few of them<br />\nare as specific as Proxmire about ways in which the government can<br />\neliminate in the military spending.<br />\n\"There's lots of fat we can eliminate in the military budget,\" said<br />\nProxmire. \"The B1 bomber is a turkey.\" The plane is too heavy and<br />\ncarries too light a payload. The original projected cost per plane was<br />\n$25 million, but now it is estimated that a single BI bomber would<br />\ncost $95 million. Proxmire is also disturbed by the size of the<br />\nPentagon bureaucracy: \"We have more civilians working for the<br />\ndefense.department than for all other agencies, other than the post<br />\nmilitary<br />\noffice, combined.\" He estimates that because of the<br />\nwill<br />\nbe a<br />\nDepartment<br />\nDefense<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\npromotion system everyone<br />\n2000.<br />\nyear<br />\nthe<br />\nby<br />\nadmiral<br />\nan<br />\nor<br />\ngeneral<br />\n<br />\nto their induction notices: Grant Abrams, M.R.

Next week, in the<br />\nconclusion of the interview, political and social issues of national<br />\ninterest will be covered.<br />\nHow did you.become involved in problems of #<br />\ngender identity and sexual deviation?,<br />\nWhen I was a graduate student at Harvard,<br />\nthere was a case of intersex<br />\n(hertnaphroditism) presented to the small<br />\ngroup I was a member of. It was a case, as<br />\nI know today, of a fifteen year-old with<br />\nandrogen insensitivity. That meant that he had been born looking,like a girl, except<br />\nthat somebody found two lumps in the<br />\ngroin, decided they were testes and that<br />\nthis person without a penis would have to<br />\nbe raised up as a boy. That was some time<br />\nin the first year of life, when the parents<br />\nhad signed the birth certificate as a female.<br />\nThey were Oven some vague kind of<br />\nprognosis that nothing could be done at<br />\nthe moment, but it could be done when he<br />\ngot to be a teenager and started to go into<br />\npuberty. In retrospect, one can see that<br />\nthis was a case of extremely bad<br />\nmanagement. At puberty, he<br />\ngrew<br />\nbreasts instead of a male body shape. He<br />\nwas in the hospital to see if anything could<br />\nbe done for him. Thet remarkable thing about it was that in spite of the<br />\nhandicap of<br />\ngrowing up without a penis, and in spite of the, shall we call it, the insult of a body<br />\nthat<br />\ngrew in female dimensions at puberty, he was quite persuaded in his self-understanding<br />\nthat he was a boy, and he had the general outlook of a boy. Of course, he was<br />\nmortified<br />\nthat he had no penis, but he certainly didn't act or behave like a girl. I took that<br />\ncase as<br />\na starting point and used the information, the principles that it demonstrated<br />\nas a basis<br />\nfor a search of the literatu-re, medical and psychological, on hermaphroditism.<br />\nThat<br />\nculminated in a term paper which itself became the basis of my PhD dissertation, which<br />\nwas an extensive review of a century worth of medical literature and a detailed<br />\ncase<br />\nwork-up of ten cases of various different diagnostic types of hermaphroditism.<br />\nThe<br />\nperson that I worked closely with in getting those ten cases was Doctor Wilkins from<br />\nthe<br />\nPediatric Endocrine Clinic here at Johns Hopkins, which was the first one in the world,<br />\nand it happened also to be the world's leading center for birth defects of the sex organs<br />\nand the treatment of those children. I came down here for a visit to use the files and see<br />\nsome of the patients and that ended up in an arrangement being made a couple of<br />\nyears<br />\nlater that I would come down here to work. That was 1951.<br />\nHave you encountered much opposition to your work? Do you have trouble getting<br />\ngrunt money?<br />\nWell, back in those days nobody knew I existed, so I didn't get any opposition.<br />\nThe..<br />\nmore visibility one gets in anything to do with sex education or sex therapy or sex<br />\nresearch, then the more opposition develops. This happens to be a'very negative era, as<br />\neverybody knows, for all of science and research in the public mind. I do think that sex<br />\nresearch gets a little extra of that negative reaction. It makes a good whipping boy. For<br />\ninstance, there's a small, media magazine that was first published in 1933 under the<br />\nname Sexology. It was a very serious attempt on the part of the publisher, who,-by the<br />\nway, was the man who first brought out Sports Illustrated, and also the very first of the<br />\nscience fiction magazines and many others\u2014it was a very serious attempt on his part to<br />\nprovide elementary sexual information for blue-collar people. He subsidized the<br />\nmagazine on the basis of his other ones. For more than an quarter of a century, it was<br />\nnot possible to sell that magazine by subscription through the Federal mail because it<br />\nhad sex on the cover and it was offensive to the Post Office to carry it. It had to be sold<br />\nat newsstands only, under the counter. As recently as this year, they finally decided to<br />\nchange its name. The new name is Together. The 'reason for that was that some news<br />\nvendors in polite places, like drugstores and department stores, still will not put a<br />\n. magazine on sale if it has sex on the cover, and it doesn't matter what the contents are,<br />\nit's just the word itself. Well that's a straw in the wind that indicates how strong the<br />\nsexual taboo still reigns in our society.<br />\nYou are often in the position of advising the parents of all infant with ambiguous<br />\ngenitalia ill regard to whic.h sex they will raise their child as. What factors enter into your<br />\ncounseling:'<br />\nPoint number one is that you never assign the baby to be reared in the sex that it will<br />\nbe<br />\ntotally incapable of rehabilitation in. You never rear a baby in the sex that it will not<br />\nbe able to function well in, especially in the sexual life of adulthood. So if the evidence<br />\nof<br />\nyour senses is that this baby has no penis., then you never expect it to be raised as a<br />\nboy<br />\nbecause there .is no technique for creating an adequate penis by surgery. It's been<br />\nattempted. especially for a boy or man who loses his penis. What it produces is better<br />\nthan nothing for him. but it still isn't a workable penis. It's okay for creating a bulge<br />\nin<br />\n<br />\nhis bathing suit. It may even be okay for passing me urine, but you never can get it so<br />\nthat it-will be erected enough or solid enough to go into the vagina in intercourse. Now<br />\nthe other way around, when you see a baby born with a penis it is quite possible,<br />\nalthough it's extremely rare, that there are no testicles but that baby could have two<br />\novaries inside and a uterus. Under those circumstances, surgery can be completely<br />\neffective and rehabilitative, and the person can grow up to have intercourse as a woman,<br />\nand have a pregnancy. So you need first of all to look at the evidence of your senses, as<br />\nto what can-be donewith the genitalia in corrective surgery. And second of all, you need<br />\nto have the diagnosis so that you actually know what it is you're working with, which<br />\ncondition, whether any other supportive treatment is necessary. The decisions that cause<br />\nthe biggest difficulty are those of babies who are chromosomally male and who have two<br />\ngonads that are actually testicular in structure rather than ovarian, even though its<br />\nusually defective testicular structure . People tend to look for the chromosomes, the<br />\nactual chromosome count as being the absolute standard. It isn't so. For example, it's<br />\nquite possible to have a genetic male, XY, with two testicles in the abdomen in a<br />\ncompletely normal female body.<br />\nAt what age to you involve the child in this decision? How much does he or she become<br />\ninvolved in the process?<br />\nYou have a pretty free hand up until<br />\nabout eighteen months of age. Eighteen<br />\nmonths is \u2022 not a fixed cut off point<br />\nbecause it's a little variable from one child<br />\nto another. For most children,however, it<br />\nis the age at 'which they begin to get<br />\nlanguage and they very rapidly get to<br />\nunderstand sex differences in language<br />\nbecause it's so essential a- part of our<br />\nlanguage as people classify as \"he\" or<br />\n\"she\", \"boy\" or .\u0300`girl\". So, it's at that<br />\nstage that children begin to pick up some<br />\nof the universal criteria of sex difference<br />\nas well as the linguistic ones...and sooner<br />\nor 'later, anatomy. You don't have a native<br />\nlanguage at eighteen months, but you do<br />\nhave one by four and a half, and in those<br />\nintervening years it's all been settled. So<br />\nby the same age you have differentiated<br />\nthe essential core of your gender identity,<br />\neither as male or female or somewhere in<br />\nbetween. So what it means is that the<br />\nolder a child becomes after eighteen<br />\nmonths the more you have -to respect the<br />\ndegree to which the gender identity has already differentiat<br />\ned when you begin to make a<br />\ndecision. Let's jump ahead and say I have a twelve-year old who<br />\ncomes in and gives me a<br />\nvery clear message that other people must have made a<br />\nmistake from birth onwards<br />\nbecause this child says, \"I just don't belong as a girl.\" I've had that<br />\nhappen\u2014in 'a child<br />\nthat had two ovaries. I've also had the same diagnosis in another child who.said,\"They<br />\ntold me I was a boy but it's not working,so you better change me over to be a girl.\"<br />\nIn<br />\nboth of these families nobody had ever been certain if the child reallywaS supposed to<br />\nbe<br />\na boy or a girl. The case had been managed at the time .of birth in such a way<br />\nthat the parents were not given a clear directive. That<br />\ndoes happen still in modern<br />\nmedical practice.<br />\nThe Olympic. Committee, along with other sports organizations, decide on sex by use of<br />\nthe Barr body test (chromosomes). How do you feel about this? Can you suggest a .fairer<br />\nmethod?<br />\nTake your pants down and have a look.<br />\nDo you feel that's the only criteria?<br />\nNo, I think there's a proper answer to this dilemma. Instead of<br />\nhaving people compete<br />\non the basis of physique as they do only in wrestling and prize fighting,<br />\nthey should have<br />\nit for all the sports. After all, if you subdivide people for tennis<br />\nonly on thesbasis of<br />\nwhether they're men or women, you still don't allow a place for the very<br />\nsmall built<br />\nwon\u2014n,or man, nor for the very large built one. In other words:this idea<br />\nof only men in<br />\none group and women in the other group has a hidden assumption<br />\nthat all the<br />\ncompetitors will be of average size,.and it doesn't allow for any of the variations and<br />\nextremes in body build in human beings. If we did make that allowance then it wouldn't<br />\nmatter whether somebody was reproductive as a male or as a female.<br />\nDo you feel this change will ever come about?<br />\nWell, you know people do get their gender identity built into them<br />\n-with the same depth<br />\nand intensity as their native language. You threaten any, even very superficial, part of it<br />\nand the threat is experienced as a threat to the entirety. When you talk about making<br />\nthe vocational role unisex, instead of stereotyping them as male or female, a great many<br />\npeople experience that as a threat which would include the idea that you're going to<br />\nmake their sex organs unisex as well. Well, the same thing happensiwith. regards to sports<br />\ncompetition. What you are doing is breaking the convention that men shouldn't<br />\ncompete with women. And then a whole lot of people feel that you are asking to get rid<br />\nof their sex organs for that sarane reason.<br />\nDo _vou feel there's any hope for the androgynous child, a child who is reared in an<br />\nenvironment that does not dictate sex roles?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWhether children can be reared like that will depend on whether social customs change.<br />\nRight now we code almost everything we can think of in terms of sex. We've even coded<br />\nnouns as to whether they're male nouns or female nouns, regardless of what they signify.<br />\nThere's a little of it left in the English language. The romance languages are full of it. So<br />\nwe're pretty obsessed with maximizing sex 'differences and introducing them everywhere<br />\nwe can. Well, we could have had several thousand years of history of maximizing the<br />\nsimilarities between the sexes, but we haven't. So, at the very minimum,it takes time to<br />\nchange.<br />\nYou have to begin somewhere. Are you going to begin with<br />\nthe old generation first, or with the new?. Are you going to rely on chance toget the<br />\nchange going or are you going to engineer it?

For the department's decision to stand (in<br />\nlight of the not unimportant fact, that no Marxist has ever<br />\nbeen tenured at Hopkins), without due process of review by<br />\nan Academic Council ad-hoc committee, would go down as<br />\nan officious disregard of an entire career.<br />\nOn the departmental level (fiefdoms which a prominent<br />\nprofessor has termed the \"intellectual slums\" of the<br />\nUniversity), the tenure process has become so rigid and<br />\nsecretive that, while the departments naturally maintain<br />\ntheir own ranks, special cases like Pfeffer are all too easily<br />\nlost within the Gilman corridors. The Academic Council, in<br />\nwanting to avoid what would amount to a slap in the<br />\nPolitical Science department's face, has taken a slow,<br />\ncareful approach to Pfeffer's appeal. That appeal should be<br />\ngranted, in that the denial of tenure means a denial of<br />\nOutside review by academic peers, and a seeming disinterest<br />\nin teaching and general contributions to Hopkins. While the<br />\nCouncil proceeds cautiously, taking some sideways steps,<br />\nthey should consider as one goal resolving Pfeffer's position<br />\nbefore the end of the term. That, at least, would show some<br />\nregard for the largest part of the University --undergraduates -- and for someone who is of tremendous<br />\nvalue to all parts.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nUniversity administrators<br />\naround the country, President<br />\nMuller included, have recently<br />\ndecried the seeming failure of our<br />\neducational institutions to train<br />\nstudents to think critically, write<br />\neffectively, and communicate<br />\nclearly. In his recent essays in<br />\nJohns Hopkins alumni<br />\npublications, Dr. Muller has<br />\ncriticized his own institution for<br />\nthis same failure, noting that<br />\nthese basic goals of university<br />\neducation have somewhere been<br />\nlost in the scramble of students<br />\nfor professional certification and<br />\nin the pressure on faculty to<br />\ngenerate research and<br />\npublications.<br />\nNowhere is the urgency of this<br />\nissue more apparent than when a<br />\nsuperb teacher on the faculty is<br />\ndenied tenure and eliminated<br />\nfrom the University -- ostensibly<br />\nfor failure to meet those same<br />\n<br />\nWHAT0)IT,<br />\nLEONID?...<br />\nA LITTLE HEAVY<br />\nON THE APPLE<br />\nFE, RIGHT?<br />\n<br />\nprofessional standards that have<br />\nbeen blamed for the decline of<br />\neducation in our universities. The<br />\nrecent departmental decision not<br />\nto promote Professor Richard<br />\nPfeffer -- who was, during my<br />\nyears at Hopkins, a teacher of<br />\nunequaled skill and dedication -is a tragic example. Put quite<br />\nsimply, Professor Pfeffer is one<br />\nof the precious few faculty<br />\nmembers left on the Homewood<br />\ncampus who demands of students<br />\nthat they think critically and<br />\nwrite effectively -- and who is<br />\nwilling at the same time to<br />\nexpend effort to impart these<br />\ninvaluable skills.<br />\nIf the University is at all<br />\nserious about its commitment to<br />\nthe most basic goals of higher<br />\neducation, its Academic Council<br />\nwill seriously consider Professor<br />\nPfeffer's appeal to have this<br />\ndecision reviewed.<br />\nAndrew G.

CONSIDINE<br />\nYou really wonder, after a<br />\nwhile, why it is that the politics<br />\nof student activities are so<br />\nimportant to some people. It<br />\nobviously isn't a reflection of<br />\ngeneral student interest, as most<br />\nelection results will plainly<br />\nindicate. It seems More likely<br />\nthat student politics exists<br />\nsolely for the use and<br />\nenjoyment of stadent<br />\npoliticians.<br />\nTake the SAC, for example.<br />\nThe SAC meets about twice<br />\nyearly, so it seems an unlikely<br />\nspawning ground for political<br />\npower plays. When they met<br />\nTuesday,it- was merely to vote<br />\non budget appropriations. Ron<br />\nBialek expected nothing less,<br />\nand not \u2022 much more, and most<br />\nmembers were hoping to get<br />\nthrough the meeting in as little<br />\ntime as possible.<br />\nAs these things go, however,<br />\none group generallywantsmore<br />\nmoney than it had been<br />\nofferred. In this case,it was the<br />\nBarnstormers; they needed the<br />\nmoney to run 'plays in<br />\n.ShriverHall, since it seemed that<br />\nthey would have no other<br />\nsuitable alternative hall. Fine.<br />\nBut where does the money<br />\ncome from?<br />\nIn steps \"Big Stu\" Davidson.<br />\nNow, personally, aside from the<br />\ngeneral aversion I have to<br />\npoliticians with folksy<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\ncouncil asked for (and got) an,<br />\nextra two hundred dollars,<br />\nwhich was ,snatched from the<br />\nFlying Monkey appropriation.<br />\n(Just off the cuff, though, Ron<br />\nBialek felt that Flying Monkey<br />\ncould easily get an extra two<br />\nhundred from the Social<br />\nCommittee budget, of which<br />\nboth Flying Monkey and Fine<br />\nArts are subsidiaries).<br />\nOn the whole, those who<br />\ncame to the meeting with<br />\npurely budgetary concerns left<br />\nbasically satisfied, if somewhat<br />\nirritated by the length of the<br />\nmeeting. But the politicos left<br />\ngenerally disappointed. Sure,<br />\nthey had flexed their muscles,<br />\nbut the big prize had eluded<br />\nthem; they were unable to<br />\nprove their power to be<br />\nultimately greater than that of<br />\ntheir adversary. Just as well,<br />\nthough, since an appetite for<br />\npower is only made bigger by<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nAt least they can't cry that<br />\nthe News-Letter has ignored<br />\nthem. Some one once remarked<br />\nthat they disliked voting,<br />\nbecause \"it only seemed to<br />\nencourage them.\" The same can<br />\nbe held with regard to political<br />\nreporting. Still, if one wished to<br />\ndestroy the political credibility<br />\nof some of these clowns, all<br />\nthat would be necessary would<br />\nbe to print a verbatim transcript<br />\nof an SAC meeting.<br /><br />\nBy MIKE GIULIANO<br />\nWilliam Proxmire, a United States :senator since 1957 (when he<br />\nfilled the seat vacated by Joe McCarthy) is a powerful man in his<br />\nhome state of Wisconsin, continually reelected by huge majorities, and<br />\nin Congress, where he is chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban<br />\nAffairs committee. Speaking here Tuesday night, Proxmire stated that<br />\nmany of his fellow Democrats are reluctant to'recognize the giantism<br />\nof the federal government. As an example of how rapidly our<br />\nbureaucracy is expanding, Proxmire cited the Department of Health,<br />\nEducation and Welfare, whose total budget has risen from 7 billion<br />\ndollars in 1965 go 56 billion dollars in 1977. \"We can't solve our<br />\nproblems simply by appropriating money,\" said Proxmire. \"There is a<br />\ncavalier disregard for the value of the dollar.\"<br />\nDisturbed by the squandering of tax money, Proxmire established<br />\nhis Golden Fleece Award, in 1975. The award bestows recognition on<br />\nthe most outraseous federal expenditures. Past recipients include the<br />\nNational Science Foundation, for spending $84,000 on an attempt to<br />\ndetermine \"Why People Fall in iLove\"; the FAA, for taking 75<br />\nmeasurements of airline stewardesses :at a cost of $57,000; and a<br />\n$103,000 study of whether sunfish that drink tequila are more<br />\naggressive than sunfish that drink gin. The Navy estimated that the<br />\ncost of furnishing the vice-presidential house would be $15,000, but<br />\nwhen it actually cost $500,000, Proxmire felt an award was merited.<br />\nThe mansion's resident, Nelson Rockefeller, was not pleased to receive<br />\nhis Golden Fleece Award, stormed into Proxmire's office and<br />\ncomplained: \"Bill, you shouldn't have given me the award. I don't<br />\neven live in that house.\"<br />\nAs the bureaucracy has grown, taxes have risen. The average citizen,<br />\naccording to Proxmire, paid 10% of his income in local,state and<br />\nnational taxes in 1930, 20% in 1940, and pays 37% at the present<br />\ntime. Almost every politician, Proxmire included, favors holding down<br />\nthe size of government and keeping taxes from rising, but few of them<br />\nare as specific as Proxmire about ways in which the government can<br />\neliminate in the military spending.<br />\n\"There's lots of fat we can eliminate in the military budget,\" said<br />\nProxmire. \"The B1 bomber is a turkey.\" The plane is too heavy and<br />\ncarries too light a payload. The original projected cost per plane was<br />\n$25 million, but now it is estimated that a single BI bomber would<br />\ncost $95 million. Proxmire is also disturbed by the size of the<br />\nPentagon bureaucracy: \"We have more civilians working for the<br />\ndefense.department than for all other agencies, other than the post<br />\nmilitary<br />\noffice, combined.\" He estimates that because of the<br />\nwill<br />\nbe a<br />\nDepartment<br />\nDefense<br />\nthe<br />\nin<br />\npromotion system everyone<br />\n2000.<br />\nyear<br />\nthe<br />\nby<br />\nadmiral<br />\nan<br />\nor<br />\ngeneral<br /><br />\nto their induction notices: Grant Abrams, M.R.

Next week, in the<br />\nconclusion of the interview, political and social issues of national<br />\ninterest will be covered.<br />\nHow did you.become involved in problems of #<br />\ngender identity and sexual deviation?,<br />\nWhen I was a graduate student at Harvard,<br />\nthere was a case of intersex<br />\n(hertnaphroditism) presented to the small<br />\ngroup I was a member of. It was a case, as<br />\nI know today, of a fifteen year-old with<br />\nandrogen insensitivity. That meant that he had been born looking,like a girl, except<br />\nthat somebody found two lumps in the<br />\ngroin, decided they were testes and that<br />\nthis person without a penis would have to<br />\nbe raised up as a boy. That was some time<br />\nin the first year of life, when the parents<br />\nhad signed the birth certificate as a female.<br />\nThey were Oven some vague kind of<br />\nprognosis that nothing could be done at<br />\nthe moment, but it could be done when he<br />\ngot to be a teenager and started to go into<br />\npuberty. In retrospect, one can see that<br />\nthis was a case of extremely bad<br />\nmanagement. At puberty, he<br />\ngrew<br />\nbreasts instead of a male body shape. He<br />\nwas in the hospital to see if anything could<br />\nbe done for him. Thet remarkable thing about it was that in spite of the<br />\nhandicap of<br />\ngrowing up without a penis, and in spite of the, shall we call it, the insult of a body<br />\nthat<br />\ngrew in female dimensions at puberty, he was quite persuaded in his self-understanding<br />\nthat he was a boy, and he had the general outlook of a boy. Of course, he was<br />\nmortified<br />\nthat he had no penis, but he certainly didn't act or behave like a girl. I took that<br />\ncase as<br />\na starting point and used the information, the principles that it demonstrated<br />\nas a basis<br />\nfor a search of the literatu-re, medical and psychological, on hermaphroditism.<br />\nThat<br />\nculminated in a term paper which itself became the basis of my PhD dissertation, which<br />\nwas an extensive review of a century worth of medical literature and a detailed<br />\ncase<br />\nwork-up of ten cases of various different diagnostic types of hermaphroditism.<br />\nThe<br />\nperson that I worked closely with in getting those ten cases was Doctor Wilkins from<br />\nthe<br />\nPediatric Endocrine Clinic here at Johns Hopkins, which was the first one in the world,<br />\nand it happened also to be the world's leading center for birth defects of the sex organs<br />\nand the treatment of those children. I came down here for a visit to use the files and see<br />\nsome of the patients and that ended up in an arrangement being made a couple of<br />\nyears<br />\nlater that I would come down here to work. That was 1951.<br />\nHave you encountered much opposition to your work? Do you have trouble getting<br />\ngrunt money?<br />\nWell, back in those days nobody knew I existed, so I didn't get any opposition.<br />\nThe..<br />\nmore visibility one gets in anything to do with sex education or sex therapy or sex<br />\nresearch, then the more opposition develops. This happens to be a'very negative era, as<br />\neverybody knows, for all of science and research in the public mind. I do think that sex<br />\nresearch gets a little extra of that negative reaction. It makes a good whipping boy. For<br />\ninstance, there's a small, media magazine that was first published in 1933 under the<br />\nname Sexology. It was a very serious attempt on the part of the publisher, who,-by the<br />\nway, was the man who first brought out Sports Illustrated, and also the very first of the<br />\nscience fiction magazines and many others\u2014it was a very serious attempt on his part to<br />\nprovide elementary sexual information for blue-collar people. He subsidized the<br />\nmagazine on the basis of his other ones. For more than an quarter of a century, it was<br />\nnot possible to sell that magazine by subscription through the Federal mail because it<br />\nhad sex on the cover and it was offensive to the Post Office to carry it. It had to be sold<br />\nat newsstands only, under the counter. As recently as this year, they finally decided to<br />\nchange its name. The new name is Together. The 'reason for that was that some news<br />\nvendors in polite places, like drugstores and department stores, still will not put a<br />\n. magazine on sale if it has sex on the cover, and it doesn't matter what the contents are,<br />\nit's just the word itself. Well that's a straw in the wind that indicates how strong the<br />\nsexual taboo still reigns in our society.<br />\nYou are often in the position of advising the parents of all infant with ambiguous<br />\ngenitalia ill regard to whic.h sex they will raise their child as. What factors enter into your<br />\ncounseling:'<br />\nPoint number one is that you never assign the baby to be reared in the sex that it will<br />\nbe<br />\ntotally incapable of rehabilitation in. You never rear a baby in the sex that it will not<br />\nbe able to function well in, especially in the sexual life of adulthood. So if the evidence<br />\nof<br />\nyour senses is that this baby has no penis., then you never expect it to be raised as a<br />\nboy<br />\nbecause there .is no technique for creating an adequate penis by surgery. It's been<br />\nattempted. especially for a boy or man who loses his penis. What it produces is better<br />\nthan nothing for him. but it still isn't a workable penis. It's okay for creating a bulge<br />\nin<br /><br />\nhis bathing suit. It may even be okay for passing me urine, but you never can get it so<br />\nthat it-will be erected enough or solid enough to go into the vagina in intercourse. Now<br />\nthe other way around, when you see a baby born with a penis it is quite possible,<br />\nalthough it's extremely rare, that there are no testicles but that baby could have two<br />\novaries inside and a uterus. Under those circumstances, surgery can be completely<br />\neffective and rehabilitative, and the person can grow up to have intercourse as a woman,<br />\nand have a pregnancy. So you need first of all to look at the evidence of your senses, as<br />\nto what can-be donewith the genitalia in corrective surgery. And second of all, you need<br />\nto have the diagnosis so that you actually know what it is you're working with, which<br />\ncondition, whether any other supportive treatment is necessary. The decisions that cause<br />\nthe biggest difficulty are those of babies who are chromosomally male and who have two<br />\ngonads that are actually testicular in structure rather than ovarian, even though its<br />\nusually defective testicular structure . People tend to look for the chromosomes, the<br />\nactual chromosome count as being the absolute standard. It isn't so. For example, it's<br />\nquite possible to have a genetic male, XY, with two testicles in the abdomen in a<br />\ncompletely normal female body.<br />\nAt what age to you involve the child in this decision? How much does he or she become<br />\ninvolved in the process?<br />\nYou have a pretty free hand up until<br />\nabout eighteen months of age. Eighteen<br />\nmonths is \u2022 not a fixed cut off point<br />\nbecause it's a little variable from one child<br />\nto another. For most children,however, it<br />\nis the age at 'which they begin to get<br />\nlanguage and they very rapidly get to<br />\nunderstand sex differences in language<br />\nbecause it's so essential a- part of our<br />\nlanguage as people classify as \"he\" or<br />\n\"she\", \"boy\" or .\u0300`girl\". So, it's at that<br />\nstage that children begin to pick up some<br />\nof the universal criteria of sex difference<br />\nas well as the linguistic ones...and sooner<br />\nor 'later, anatomy. You don't have a native<br />\nlanguage at eighteen months, but you do<br />\nhave one by four and a half, and in those<br />\nintervening years it's all been settled. So<br />\nby the same age you have differentiated<br />\nthe essential core of your gender identity,<br />\neither as male or female or somewhere in<br />\nbetween. So what it means is that the<br />\nolder a child becomes after eighteen<br />\nmonths the more you have -to respect the<br />\ndegree to which the gender identity has already differentiat<br />\ned when you begin to make a<br />\ndecision. Let's jump ahead and say I have a twelve-year old who<br />\ncomes in and gives me a<br />\nvery clear message that other people must have made a<br />\nmistake from birth onwards<br />\nbecause this child says, \"I just don't belong as a girl.\" I've had that<br />\nhappen\u2014in 'a child<br />\nthat had two ovaries. I've also had the same diagnosis in another child who.said,\"They<br />\ntold me I was a boy but it's not working,so you better change me over to be a girl.\"<br />\nIn<br />\nboth of these families nobody had ever been certain if the child reallywaS supposed to<br />\nbe<br />\na boy or a girl. The case had been managed at the time .of birth in such a way<br />\nthat the parents were not given a clear directive. That<br />\ndoes happen still in modern<br />\nmedical practice.<br />\nThe Olympic. Committee, along with other sports organizations, decide on sex by use of<br />\nthe Barr body test (chromosomes). How do you feel about this? Can you suggest a .fairer<br />\nmethod?<br />\nTake your pants down and have a look.<br />\nDo you feel that's the only criteria?<br />\nNo, I think there's a proper answer to this dilemma. Instead of<br />\nhaving people compete<br />\non the basis of physique as they do only in wrestling and prize fighting,<br />\nthey should have<br />\nit for all the sports. After all, if you subdivide people for tennis<br />\nonly on thesbasis of<br />\nwhether they're men or women, you still don't allow a place for the very<br />\nsmall built<br />\nwon\u2014n,or man, nor for the very large built one. In other words:this idea<br />\nof only men in<br />\none group and women in the other group has a hidden assumption<br />\nthat all the<br />\ncompetitors will be of average size,.and it doesn't allow for any of the variations and<br />\nextremes in body build in human beings. If we did make that allowance then it wouldn't<br />\nmatter whether somebody was reproductive as a male or as a female.<br />\nDo you feel this change will ever come about?<br />\nWell, you know people do get their gender identity built into them<br />\n-with the same depth<br />\nand intensity as their native language. You threaten any, even very superficial, part of it<br />\nand the threat is experienced as a threat to the entirety. When you talk about making<br />\nthe vocational role unisex, instead of stereotyping them as male or female, a great many<br />\npeople experience that as a threat which would include the idea that you're going to<br />\nmake their sex organs unisex as well. Well, the same thing happensiwith. regards to sports<br />\ncompetition. What you are doing is breaking the convention that men shouldn't<br />\ncompete with women. And then a whole lot of people feel that you are asking to get rid<br />\nof their sex organs for that sarane reason.<br />\nDo _vou feel there's any hope for the androgynous child, a child who is reared in an<br />\nenvironment that does not dictate sex roles?<br />\n\u2022<br />\nWhether children can be reared like that will depend on whether social customs change.<br />\nRight now we code almost everything we can think of in terms of sex. We've even coded<br />\nnouns as to whether they're male nouns or female nouns, regardless of what they signify.<br />\nThere's a little of it left in the English language. The romance languages are full of it. So<br />\nwe're pretty obsessed with maximizing sex 'differences and introducing them everywhere<br />\nwe can. Well, we could have had several thousand years of history of maximizing the<br />\nsimilarities between the sexes, but we haven't. So, at the very minimum,it takes time to<br />\nchange.<br />\nYou have to begin somewhere. Are you going to begin with<br />\nthe old generation first, or with the new?. Are you going to rely on chance toget the<br />\nchange going or are you going to engineer it? That's a tough one.<br />\nto be continued next week.<br /><br />\nThe love story<br />\nthat will<br />\nscare the hell<br />\nout of you.<br /><br />\nthe<br />\nOBSESS/ON<br /><br />\nand a short by Baltimore flmmaker Rick Puller<br /><br />\nratc<br /><br />\nnews-letter<br /><br />\n- nal 12 1411<br /><br />\nCOLUMBIA PICTURES PRESENTS<br />\nA GEORGE LITTO PRODUCTION/A BRIAN DE PALMA FILM<br /><br />\nCLIFF ROBERTSON &amp; GENEVIEVE BUJOLD IN OBSESSION<br /><br />\nFRI APRIL 22 SHRIVER<br />\nSAT APRIL 23 REMSEN 1<br /><br />\n7:30 &amp; 10:00<br /><br />\nVNOFF-CAMPLIS<br />\n/ .i.NI LIVING<br />\nIV<br />\nAT<br /><br />\nG OUCHE<br />\n\u2022 SUBURBAN<br />\n\u2022 HOURLY<br />\n\u2022 FOOD<br /><br />\nCAMPUS LIVINEr<br />\nBUS SERVICE<br /><br />\nSERVICE<br /><br />\n\u2022 COED<br />\n\u2022 AVAILABLE: SEPTEMBER714/77<br />\nFOR FORTN-UEIR IINIRDIRIMATlleN/<br />\nCONTACT:<br /><br />\nBELVA SCOTT<br /><br />\n338-7f58 ?_1\"6-eN1PgsmcE<br /><br />\nVc<br />\njOLMAN NALL<br /><br />\nDON'T MI\u201c THE<br />\nqi(AND OFEN1<br /><br />\nI)A.

For the department's decision to stand (in<br />\nlight of the not unimportant fact, that no Marxist has ever<br />\nbeen tenured at Hopkins), without due process of review by<br />\nan Academic Council ad-hoc committee, would go down as<br />\nan officious disregard of an entire career.<br />\nOn the departmental level (fiefdoms which a prominent<br />\nprofessor has termed the \"intellectual slums\" of the<br />\nUniversity), the tenure process has become so rigid and<br />\nsecretive that, while the departments naturally maintain<br />\ntheir own ranks, special cases like Pfeffer are all too easily<br />\nlost within the Gilman corridors. The Academic Council, in<br />\nwanting to avoid what would amount to a slap in the<br />\nPolitical Science department's face, has taken a slow,<br />\ncareful approach to Pfeffer's appeal. That appeal should be<br />\ngranted, in that the denial of tenure means a denial of<br />\nOutside review by academic peers, and a seeming disinterest<br />\nin teaching and general contributions to Hopkins. While the<br />\nCouncil proceeds cautiously, taking some sideways steps,<br />\nthey should consider as one goal resolving Pfeffer's position<br />\nbefore the end of the term. That, at least, would show some<br />\nregard for the largest part of the University --undergraduates -- and for someone who is of tremendous<br />\nvalue to all parts.<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nUniversity administrators<br />\naround the country, President<br />\nMuller included, have recently<br />\ndecried the seeming failure of our<br />\neducational institutions to train<br />\nstudents to think critically, write<br />\neffectively, and communicate<br />\nclearly. In his recent essays in<br />\nJohns Hopkins alumni<br />\npublications, Dr. Muller has<br />\ncriticized his own institution for<br />\nthis same failure, noting that<br />\nthese basic goals of university<br />\neducation have somewhere been<br />\nlost in the scramble of students<br />\nfor professional certification and<br />\nin the pressure on faculty to<br />\ngenerate research and<br />\npublications.<br />\nNowhere is the urgency of this<br />\nissue more apparent than when a<br />\nsuperb teacher on the faculty is<br />\ndenied tenure and eliminated<br />\nfrom the University -- ostensibly<br />\nfor failure to meet those same<br /><br />\nWHAT0)IT,<br />\nLEONID?...<br />\nA LITTLE HEAVY<br />\nON THE APPLE<br />\nFE, RIGHT?<br /><br />\nprofessional standards that have<br />\nbeen blamed for the decline of<br />\neducation in our universities. The<br />\nrecent departmental decision not<br />\nto promote Professor Richard<br />\nPfeffer -- who was, during my<br />\nyears at Hopkins, a teacher of<br />\nunequaled skill and dedication -is a tragic example. Put quite<br />\nsimply, Professor Pfeffer is one<br />\nof the precious few faculty<br />\nmembers left on the Homewood<br />\ncampus who demands of students<br />\nthat they think critically and<br />\nwrite effectively -- and who is<br />\nwilling at the same time to<br />\nexpend effort to impart these<br />\ninvaluable skills.<br />\nIf the University is at all<br />\nserious about its commitment to<br />\nthe most basic goals of higher<br />\neducation, its Academic Council<br />\nwill seriously consider Professor<br />\nPfeffer's appeal to have this<br />\ndecision reviewed.<br />\nAndrew G.

At<br />\nnight he cooks a quick dinner, maybe reads a<br />\nmystery, maybe blots out on alcohol and<br />\ntelevision, then goes to bed. On weekends he loafs,<br />\nusually with Sally.<br />\nSally is married to a man who owns a chain of<br />\nconvenience stores. Sally's husband is always on<br />\nthe road. Often he sleeps in the back of one of his<br />\nstores. When he comes home,smelling like tobacco<br />\nand sour milk, he wants to make love and eat a<br />\nhome coked meal.

Sally asks.<br />\nWilly collects tequila bottles. Glass-blown<br />\ntequila bottles from Mexico. The craftsmanship is<br />\nadmirable. But his interest flags. The tequila gets in<br />\nthe way. Sally tells him he isn't kidding anybody.<br />\nWilly collects the Lew Archer mysteries of Ross<br />\nMacDonald. He collects the Travis McGee<br />\nmysteries of John D. MacDonald. He collects the<br />\nNero Wolfe mysteries of Rex Stout. Sally tells him<br />\nto look around for something else.<br />\nWilly collects newpaper clippings of victimless<br />\ncrimes like gambling and prostitution and<br />\nmarijuana busts.<br />\nSally decides Willy is through with collection.<br />\nShebrings more hobby books. Willy says he will<br />\nmake something. He will create. He makes a<br />\nweathervane for his chimney. Sally nods approval.<br />\nShe and Willy spend an entire Sunday afternoon in<br />\nbed.<br />\nWilly makes a second weathervane, one for<br />\nSally, but she won't accept it because she doesn't<br />\nknow what to tell her husband. This puts Willy off.<br />\nTo spite her he starts collecting tequila bottles<br />\nagain, arranging the empties artfully in a broom<br />\ncloset.<br />\nMore hobby books.
