S. Brightly, technical director of the Indiana State<br />\nQuarrymen's Association. This<br />\nmaterial has nationwide distribution and is shipped from coast to<br />\ncoast. It is estimated that 40 per<br />\ncent, of the building stone used in<br />\nthe United States this year will be<br />\nthe product of this Association.<br />\nThis limestone was produced<br />\n18,000,000<br />\nsomewhere around<br />\nyears ago, when the Gulf of Mexico extended up the whole interior<br />\nof the continent as an inland sea.<br />\nIt is composed of the shell remains of minute calcareous marine organisms. At Bedford, Indiana, the bed is 80 feet thick.<br />\nAfter being formed, this stone<br />\nwas covered by a 250 ft. layer of<br />\ninferior material known as Mitchell limestone which was later<br />\nWashed away by the melting snow<br />\nof the glaciers during the Ice Age.<br />\nThe deposits are so large that<br />\nthe quarries could turn out in one<br />\nPiece monoliths even larger than<br />\nthose of Egypt or Assyria.<br />\nSeveral reels of films were<br />\nShown which illustrated the various methods of cutting, shaping<br />\nNuand shipping the blocks.<br />\nMerous slides were also thrown<br />\nO n the screen which showed the<br />\napplication of Indiana limestone<br />\nto the various types of architecture.<br />\nThe talk proved to be of great<br />\ninterest to the audience. which<br />\nWas composed largely of students<br />\nIn engineering and geology.<br />\n<br />\nDRIOR to 1899<br />\nA. the works of the<br />\nWestinghouse Airbrake Company was<br />\noperated by reciprocating engines<br />\ndistributed in<br />\nvarious parts of the<br />\nplant. While this source of power was<br />\ninefficient in many respects, it was the best<br />\nknown commercial motive force of the day.<br />\nBy 1899, however, remarkable developments had been made in the design and construction of steam turbines and electric generating equipment. Called to the attention of<br />\nthe Airbrake officials, it was decided to give<br />\nthe new machines a chance, and three Westinghouse Steam Turbines were installed without delay. This was the first large installation<br />\nof its kind, anywhere.<br />\n<br />\nDaddy of All Large<br />\nCommercial Turbines<br />\nBegan Operation at<br />\nWilmerding<br />\nIt required initiative to take this step<br />\n\u2014someone had to be first. And, as in<br />\nall important pioneering achievements,<br />\nthere was much skepticism as to results.<br />\nHowever, the new units quickly proved their<br />\npracticability. Although of only 400 K. W.<br />\ncapacity they proved much more efficient and<br />\neconomical than the old reciprocating engines.<br />\nTheir economy was particularly conspicuous<br />\nbecause by careful test they showed a fuel<br />\nsaving of approximately 36 per cent.<br />\nSteam turbine development thus received<br />\nits first real impetus in 1899, the Wilmerding,<br />\nPa., performance definitely establishing this<br />\nelectrical unit as a better method of turning<br />\nthe wheels of industry.<br />\n<br />\nACHIEVEMENT 8 OPPORTUNITY<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, MARCH 25, 1924<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n00D?:iO3E4aCt000001:ti:t3aCeCtOCK0<br />\n8<br />\n\u2018Z;<br />\n<br />\nY.
