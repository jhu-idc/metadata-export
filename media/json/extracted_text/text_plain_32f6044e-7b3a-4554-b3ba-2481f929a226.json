N article which appeared in the Aulion several months ago dealing with the<br />\ncompatibility of culture with a university education has aroused no little<br />\ndiscussion. The article in question is entitled, \"Observations in a Big<br />\nUniversity,\" and deals with student life at a large Western university. Although<br />\nthe immediate point at issue, an arraignment of the free higher educational institutions of the West, may not have so much bearing upon university education in<br />\nthe East, nevertheless the vital question underlying the entire article concerns the<br />\nwhole country, the East as well as the West. The question which is asked, and<br />\none which seems to have elicited no satisfactory answer, is: Does the average<br />\ncollege student have good manners? Or perhaps it might be stated better: Has<br />\neducation an absolutely refining value?<br />\nIf we may accept as a postulate the statement that to-day education does not<br />\nexert an absolutely refining influence we do not have to seek far for what may<br />\nserve as reasons. A refining influence is exerted by association, and if the student lacking in refinement is not thrown into contact with his superiors he can<br />\nnot hope to acquire by unconscious effort that ease and grace of manner which<br />\nshould denote the college man.<br />\nIt is generally accepted as true that a college education means more than mere<br />\n\"book-learning.\" In the admirable democracy which as a rule characterizes college life a man learns a great deal from contact with his fellows. It is not the<br />\ndig who gets the most out of a course at college, although he may rank easily<br />\nfirst in his classes, but it is the man who rubs elbows with his fellows who gets the<br />\nbetter training. If he learns to give hard blows, he also learns to bear them unflinchingly in return. If he gives up the careful influence of home life by going<br />\naway to college, he gets in return a confidence and a self-reliance which will stand<br />\nhim in good stead in the future. But are all these things conducive to good mantiers? Not at all. They give self-control, self-reliance, and confidence, but they<br />\ndo not necessarily give that urbanity of manner which should designate the<br />\ncollege man.<br />\nOne thing which marks the decay of manners among college men is the<br />\nlack of personal interest between the instructor and his class. It is not the fault<br />\nof one more than the other. In this present day and generation the instructor<br />\nis so busily engaged in his research work that he has little time to devote to his<br />\nclasses. It is true that he grudgingly gives an hour to the men who are consigned to his care, but after the close of that hour he might as well be an inhabitant of another planet. ITe is engrossed in the studies which he hopes will make<br />\nhis name famous, but in his selfish seclusion he forgets that there is a duty which<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nhe owes to the students. He is engaged in making scholars of them, if such a<br />\nthing is possible, but at any cost he should try to make men of them, men in every<br />\nsense of the word. That should stand before everything else; that is what a<br />\ncollege education should do, if nothing else can ever be accomplished.<br />\nWe hear much of the influence exerted upon the men of the first half of the<br />\nnineteenth century by their professors at college. This is particularly true of that<br />\ncoterie of famous men who obtained their training in the smaller colleges of New<br />\nEngland. The professor was in personal touch with the men. He knew each<br />\none ; he knew his struggles, his weaknesses, his temptations, and his ambitions. A<br />\nkind word or a helping hand at the right time was the making of many a man.<br />\nThe perplexed youth knew that there was a sympathetic ear into which he could<br />\npour his troubles. He knew that he had a kind friend who was always willing to<br />\nbe a guide. and a counselor. Consequently those men received a training which<br />\nwas of 'inestimable value.<br />\nThere is another side. No one would believe for a moment that it is all the<br />\nfault of the instructor; far from it. The colleges to which reference has just been<br />\nmade were all small institutions. It was easily possible for the president of the<br />\nuniversity to know personally every man. To-day such a thing is out of the<br />\nquestion. The large colleges and universities have from one to four thousand<br />\nstudents. The professor reads his lectures to a large class of men, few of whom<br />\nhe would know if he met them on the street. Jn such a case it would be absurd<br />\nto expect that close union which does so much for the undergraduate. It can not<br />\nbe denied that even in the majority of cases where the professor makes advances<br />\nto the men in the class he is repulsed, because they seem to take a delight in<br />\nimposing upon a man who tries to introduce any binding tie of comradeship. The<br />\nresult is not a satisfactory one to either side.<br />\nThis lack of sympathy between the professor and his men may be one of the<br />\ncauses of the decay of college manners. The college man is left to his own<br />\ndevices, he is thrown upon his own resources. Does the professor care how the<br />\nman spends his time outside the classroom? Apparently not. Does he know<br />\nwhether that man is engaged in playing football, or in playing the slot machine,<br />\nwhether he is sitting at a table studying, or sitting at a table drawing to three<br />\njacks and a queen? If he guesses it from his knowledge of the man gained in<br />\nthe classroom he never makes any use of that interesting information. If the man<br />\nmaintains a passing grade he lives his life as he pleases to the end of the chapter.<br />\nThe author of \"Observations in a Big University\" asserts that the men who<br />\nwork their way through college are only so much dead Wood, and that for them<br />\neducation has no refining value. But such an argument can not be advanced to<br />\nstrengthen the claim that college manners have deteriorated. These men are not<br />\nso much dead wood ; they can be found in every college taking an active interest<br />\nin all the pure sports and recreations in which college students delight. Colleges<br />\nneed more of them. A man who is working his way is serious in his pursuit of<br />\nknowledge; he has a definite aim in life and he is getting an education because it<br />\nwill further that aim. Such graduates are better advertisements for a college<br />\n<br />\n\f. THE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nthan the men who go to college for the social standing it will give them or because the only other alternative is to go to work.<br />\nThere was once a time when it was truly an honor to be a college man. Now<br />\nit is very different. Men seem to go through college without giving a thought<br />\nto the fact that they are receiving a training which is far more comprehensive and<br />\nmore thorough than that which falls to the lot of most young men. And because<br />\nit ,has lost that certain dignity in the eyes of the men themselves it can no longer<br />\nmaintain that dignity in the eyes of others. If the college man refuses to accept<br />\nhimself seriously, how can he expect others to do so?<br />\nWe should imagine that the best, the purest English would be spoken by<br />\ncollege men. If the purity of the English language is to be preserved, who will<br />\npreserve it if not the men who are trained by education? But the fact is that there<br />\nare no more inveterate users of slang, as a class, than college men. Perhaps the<br />\nbest criterion of a man is the language he uses ; if that is the case the public would<br />\nbe warranted in declaring that college manners are not what they once were, and<br />\nthat education no longer exerts a refining influence.<br />\nA college education does not in itself exert a refining influence. It should<br />\nteach a man to separate the true from the false, to recognize the true and to<br />\nappreciate it. Yet it can not compel him to do so. The writer of this article may<br />\nhave gone far afield in attempting to find causes for this lack of manners, and he<br />\nis fully conscious that he has offered no suggestion which in any way can help in<br />\narriving at a solution of the problem. All that he has done, and all that he has<br />\nattempted to do, is to throw some light upon some of the apparent causes.<br />\n<br />\nSENIORS WIN DEBATE.<br />\nII V, sixth annual inter-class debate, now rapidly fading into remote college<br />\n_ history, was outwardly very much like its fine predecessors. There was<br />\nthe same dignified march with mandolin accompaniment, the same neat<br />\nintroduction by the President, the usual time-honored gags by Dr. Lee, and the<br />\nsame impassional oratorical assault and repulse. The debate recalled the contest<br />\nof last year, particularly, because the class of 1903 was represented by precisely<br />\nthe same team and that team won.<br />\nAs usual the decision of the judges failed to please everybody, least of all<br />\nthe losing class ; but to the disinterested spectator it seemed as fair as any such<br />\ndecision can be. Clearly the seniors won on delivery. Their advantage in argument, if they had any at all, was certainly very slight.<br />\nPlaggemeyer was all that was expected of him, deliberate, easy, and finished,<br />\ntoo finished, perhaps, so that he suggested the danger of over-training. A slight<br />\ntinge of Licking's tempestuous enthusiasm would have done him no harm. Blum,<br />\nwithout his sarcasm and with more of a set speech, did better than last year, and<br />\nStrayer for some reason did not seem to do himself justice. Humrichouse is<br />\non the way toward effective work, and another year when he is more at home on<br />\nthe platform, will doubtless give a better account of himself. The dead-level<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nmonotony of Rosenheim's speech was more than relieved by the variety and abar<br />\ndon of Licking's. To those who have occasionally dropped in on the training Licking's performance seemed quite a tour de force. He overdid the part, to be sure,<br />\nand his style, taking as it was at first, soon began to pall on the audience which<br />\nit had stirred into generous good humor. His speech, however, was not merely<br />\n\"hot air,\" to use a classic bit of debating slang; a good deal of it was really effective refutation,all the more to be commended because it had the air of being frankly<br />\nspontaneous.<br />\nThis quality, by the way, was unfortunately lacking in most of the other<br />\nspeeches. Debaters have learned by experience that a carefully-written memorized<br />\nspeech, comfortably and calmly delivered, is more apt to win than a string of<br />\nhalting, ill-phrased rejoinders. They ought to learn further that the speech of a<br />\nman who knows his subject and has learned by practice to think about it on his<br />\nfeet and to put his thoughts into decent English on the spot, is much better than<br />\neither.<br />\nThere is good reason, of course, why the .first speeches on both sides should<br />\nbe memorized word for word and delivered with as much art as weeks of training<br />\ncan inculcate; but there is no reason why the following speakers, or the first ones<br />\neither, for that matter, should have frequent recourse to the formula, \"my opponents will doubtless say,\" and then proceed to demolish the arguments which they<br />\nhave themselves set up. It is a good thing to know what one's opponents are going<br />\nto say, but it is wise to let them say it first. More than one good speech has gone<br />\nwide of the mark because the preceding speaker did not do what was expected of<br />\nhim, and it was too late to change the polished phrases for something more<br />\nappropriate.<br />\nAside from the fact that it furnished a last opportunity for the classes of 1903<br />\nand 1904 to try conclusions, the debate was interesting as a preliminary contest<br />\nto the inter-collegiate debate with North Carolina. Last year the visitors won by<br />\na very narrow margin. We have now an opportunity to return the compliment.<br />\nIf the men chosen to represent us will take the lessons of that debate and the recent<br />\none to their hearts, and if the undergraduates, as a body, will encourage the team<br />\nwith enthusiastic support, there is no reason why we may not beat North Carolina<br />\non her own grounds.<br />\nThe debate was preceded by the Freshmen speaking contest. The Lee prize<br />\nfor excellence in public speaking was awarded to Goldman, who delivered l'earre's<br />\naddress on Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Straugn and Zeigler were the other<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nCONCERNING THE EASTER TRIP OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS<br />\nu RING the many meetings of the Fernandis Club there has been so much<br />\ndiscussion about the Easter trip of the Musical Clubs that an explanation<br />\nis perhaps permissible.<br />\nSince this is the first year in the history of the clubs that Old Point Comfort<br />\nhas not been visited at Easter, it has caused much wonder and no little criticism<br />\n<br />\nsp<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n!*<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nconcerning the management.<br />\nFi'om the beginning of the collegiate year, until a few weeks ago, there was<br />\nnot the slightest doubt that the Hopkins men would once more enjoy their Spring<br />\nvacation at Fortress Monroe. There was every reason to believe that all plans<br />\nwould be sucessful, for a contract signed by the manager of the Chamberlin and<br />\nHygeia Hotels and the manager of the Musical Clubs was supposed to be sufficiently<br />\nbinding.<br />\nSince the signing of the contracts, however, the Chamberlin Hotel has<br />\nchanged managers, and the Hygeia is a thing of the past.<br />\nLast week a representative of the clubs was sent to Old Point to find if some<br />\npossible arrangements might be made by which the usual Easter trip could be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nAll argument was fruitless for the Hotel Chamberlin, even at that early date,<br />\nwas well crowded, and every room in the house was already engaged for the<br />\none time when Fortress Monroe awakens to life. Whether the hotel management<br />\nwas aware of the contract made earlier in the year is a matter of speculation. The<br />\nlegal status of the contract seemed to need no further investigation.<br />\nOf course, technically, the responsibility of the hotel is not shifted by the<br />\nchange in managers; but as the contract was signed by the managers of the clubs,<br />\na minor, the contract could not be valid. Then again, the Musical Clubs are not<br />\na legal organization, and so a contract signed in their behalf would be purely a<br />\npersonal matter.<br />\nThis will perhaps clear the legal atmosphere, and show that the trip was not<br />\nlost through the negligence on the part of the manager.<br />\nIt was hinted that the conduct of the men in past years might account for the<br />\nclubs not being able to return to Old Point. This was most assuredly not the<br />\ncase, for there was less disorder last year than ever before. Indeed, the manager<br />\nof the hotels complimented the men on their excellent order.<br />\nIn discussing the situation this year, the new manager seemed to be governed<br />\nalniost entirely by the scarcity of accommodations. It may be consoling to those<br />\nmost interested to know that the Yale Base Ball Team has been unsuccessful in<br />\nits efforts to play its annual game at Old Point with the Artillery School. The<br />\nCornell Musical Club were also so desirous of being at Old Point during the Easter<br />\nholidays that they sent their manager down to Old Point to engage accommodations. In this they were unsuccessful.<br />\nWhere the clubs will go is still more interesting than why they will not go to<br />\ntheir usual \"loafing grounds ;\" but on this subject there is really a sad dearth of<br />\ninformation.<br />\n\u2014 Several places are being considered, and everything possible is being done to<br />\nfind some place that will offer similar attractions to those offered by Old Point<br />\nComfort.<br />\nIf it were earlier in the year, a trip to Atlantic City might be a possibility ;<br />\nbut at this late date an attempt to make such an expensive trip is out of the question. The most plausible plans include the \"old Christmas trip\" to Winchester,<br />\nVa.,Charlestown, W. Va.., Cambridge, and Easton of lower Maryland.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the Studr\u2022nts of THE JOHNS<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br />\n<br />\nAPRIL 2, 1903.<br />\n<br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br />\n<br />\nEditor in Chief, .<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor,<br />\n.<br />\nAssistant News Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\nAssistant Business Manager,<br />\n<br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nHARRY K.

All previous games pale into insignificence when compared with them, and they will be<br />\nthe standard by which future games must be judged. We have yet to find the<br />\nman who has a complaint to make. Mr, Hoffman, Mr. Dulany, Mr. Mackdermott, and the Games Committee have reached the highwater mark of athletic<br />\nsuccess. Hopkins has always stood for what is purest and best in athletics, and<br />\nthe splendid support given the games by the citizens of Baltimore bore witness<br />\nto the fact that the efforts of the University in striving to maintain a high standard<br />\nhave received universal recognition.<br />\nIn the first place the officials were selected solely on account of their fitness;<br />\nthere was not one who was not thoroughly competent, and no competitor was<br />\ngiven an undue advantage on account of ignorance on the part of an official. The<br />\nUniversity was fortunate in having secured the services of Mr. M. J.

As clerk of the course Mr.<br />\nMackdtrmott was well fitted for the position through his long experience with<br />\nathletics. We were glad to see that it was not necessary to run trial heats in the<br />\nafternoon. Perhaps the best compliment of the evening came from the newspaper men. 'Mr. Mackdermott is a wonder,\" said one, \"he is running off events<br />\nwith such a snap that we can't keep up with him.\"<br />\nAthletically, our track team made an excellent showing, and the University<br />\nhas good reason to be proud of its representatives. Every man ran for all that<br />\nwas in him, and win or lose he helped maintain the glory of Hopkins. The success of this meet makes our visit to Virginia an assured fact, and in the dual meet<br />\nwe hope to give the Virginians the hardest tussle they have ever had.<br />\n<br />\ns its leading article for this issue THE Nims-LErrER publishes a short criticism of \"College Men and Manners.\" The article is purely an academic<br />\none, and has no reference to the Johns Hopkins University. In fact this<br />\nUniversity may be regarded as in a class by itself, and it very often happens that<br />\nconditions which exist at other institutions can have no analogue here. Consequently many of the observations made on the relations of the students and the<br />\nfaculty are entirely inapplicable to Hopkins. Some of the undergraduates have<br />\ncomplained, however, that the faculty do not support the student body in the matter<br />\nof athletics. Their contention is in part a fair one. They are wrong in imagining that they should have the support of the entire faculty, because there are a<br />\ngreat number who are thrown in contact with the undergraduates, and it would<br />\nbe asking too much to expect them to witness an athletic game in which they had<br />\nno interest. But we have a right to expect those members of the faculty who are<br />\nengaged in teaching undergraduates to turn out to our games. On next Saturday the lacrosse team plays the first game of the season. On that occasion the<br />\nwhole University, if possible, should be present to do honor to the 1 earn which more<br />\nthan any other upholds the athletic renown of-the University.<br />\n<br />\nl<br />\n<br />\nHE board of editors of the \"Hullabaloo\" are extremely anxious for the students to co-operate with them in preparing the book. There are numbers<br />\nof items of interest which they may never see unless brought to their attention by some one who is interested. Poetry, \"stunt\" club, grinds, and other<br />\nmaterial of a similar character is requested. Any man who is able to draw<br />\nwould be helping the board greatly if he would turn his talent to account in assisting to make the book a success. There is only a week left in which matter can be<br />\nturned in, and those who are thinking of contributing will confer a favor on the<br />\neditors if they hand in their contributions at once.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LF,TTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nnimiumumillInimmilluiumnimM11011111111110111101111111111111111 OillielitIlliiimmn001111111111 MIK1011111111111ffiulillill niI<br />\n<br />\n01..migge_0.0%,01<br />\nperailliag<br />\nMIN<br />\n<br />\nmen301.11.4\u201e,mono.:<br />\n<br />\ni5411111<br />\nonedscidealallo.Imalonl.mat<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n1`<br />\n.\"1g41<br />\n<br />\nMMINON11110111WIIIOMPINION<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins Club has decided to vacate its present clubhouse in June, and is<br />\nlooking for a house nearer the University.<br />\nOn the night of March 19, Dr. George B.

The meet was the most successful ever held<br />\nin this section, and fully realized the highest expectations of those who had been<br />\nmost sanguine of success. From beginning to end, one event followed another<br />\nin rapid succession, thus eliminating those long, tedious delays that usually occur<br />\nto diminish the enjoyment of such events ; furthermore, the usual crowded infield<br />\nwas lacking, none but officials and a few contestants being allowed inside the track,<br />\nso that the audience had a clear view of the entire field of action. Prof. Wm. M.<br />\nMackdermott. the Clerk of Course, and the other officials, have been highly commended for the able manner in which the games were conducted, and well may<br />\nthey. feel that their untiring efforts were productive of most satisfactory results.<br />\nIn addition to the customary events, Arthur F. Duffy of Georgetown University, who holds the world's record of 9 3-5 seconds for 100 yards, gave an exhibition 35-yard dash, equaling the present world's record of 4.,seconds fiat. The<br />\nRelay Races, of which there were ten, were unusually interesting and exciting,<br />\nespecially those between M. A. C. and B. A. C., between the Emerson Institute<br />\nof Washington and 'Marston's. Hopkins unfortunately was unable to secure a<br />\nworthy team to compete with her.<br />\nHopkins easily made the best showing of any organization represented. In<br />\neach of the events in which her men were entered, at least one of them always<br />\nsecured a place. Individual honors were carried off by Harry K. Tootle who distinguished himself by captivating three firsts\u2014in the 35-yard scratch and 35-yard<br />\nopen handicap dashes, and in the .140-yard handicap. In the 35-yard handicap<br />\nPessagno broke the State record, his time being 4. 1-5 seconds. J. A. Freeze was a<br />\nclose second to Tootle for first honors, finishing first in both the Shot Put and 40yard hurdle, and second in the 440-yard handicap.<br />\nFollowing is a brief summary of the events that are of special interest to<br />\nHopkins men:<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n35-YARD DASH\u2014SCRATCH.<br />\n<br />\nH.

His success was short lived as in the handicap<br />\ndash Pessagno, who was scratch man, in one of the trial heats lowered the record<br />\nto 4 1-5 seconds. This fact was overlooked at the time, perhaps owing to the fact<br />\nthat it occurred in a handicap dash. Since he came within 1-5 of a second of the<br />\nworld's record M r.

When<br />\nwe also consider the fact that Hopkins will hardly turn out as strong a team as<br />\nthat of last season, and that Pennsy is growing stronger each year, it may easily<br />\nbe seen that the game Saturday is apt to be well contested.<br />\nFor several weeks past the Hopkins squad has been doing steady, faithful<br />\nwork on the Druid Hill Park campus, and the results have for the most part been<br />\nvery encouraging. Team work has gradually developed and the men have daily<br />\nshown better form and condition.<br />\nFrom the present outlook, it may safely be said that at no time in the history<br />\nof Hopkins lacrosse have the new candidates had a better chance to figure in one<br />\nor more contests during the season. This is especially true of the attack. Should<br />\nB. Bernheim be unable to fill his old position at out home, foul' places out of the<br />\nsix will be open. Putts is the remaining home man, and Bird is the only midfield<br />\nman left from last year's attack. Matthai and Strohbar seem reasonably sure of<br />\npositions, and should they play at centre and first attack respectively, with Putts<br />\nat inhome and Bird at third attack, second attack and outhome will still be vacant.<br />\nFor these positions Foster, Taylor, Hoffman, Dill and Pearre are dividing honors.<br />\nFoster, it will be remembered, played on the 1900 championship team, and should<br />\nhe find time for practice, will prove a very available man.<br />\nThe defense did not suffer such severe losses at the close of the past season,<br />\nCaptain Schmeisser being the only man to graduate. From present prospects<br />\nE. Schmeisser and Blanck will mow back one position, thus leaving second defense vacant. Custis will probably make the place.<br />\nThe schedule as 'arranged by Manager J. A. Addison is undoubtedly one of<br />\nthe hardest we have ever faced. Not only is Stevens Institute an extra antagonist<br />\nfor the possession of the championship pennant, but the Crescent Athletic Club<br />\nand the Toronto Twelve are to be played.

N article which appeared in the Aulion several months ago dealing with the<br />\ncompatibility of culture with a university education has aroused no little<br />\ndiscussion. The article in question is entitled, \"Observations in a Big<br />\nUniversity,\" and deals with student life at a large Western university. Although<br />\nthe immediate point at issue, an arraignment of the free higher educational institutions of the West, may not have so much bearing upon university education in<br />\nthe East, nevertheless the vital question underlying the entire article concerns the<br />\nwhole country, the East as well as the West. The question which is asked, and<br />\none which seems to have elicited no satisfactory answer, is: Does the average<br />\ncollege student have good manners? Or perhaps it might be stated better: Has<br />\neducation an absolutely refining value?<br />\nIf we may accept as a postulate the statement that to-day education does not<br />\nexert an absolutely refining influence we do not have to seek far for what may<br />\nserve as reasons. A refining influence is exerted by association, and if the student lacking in refinement is not thrown into contact with his superiors he can<br />\nnot hope to acquire by unconscious effort that ease and grace of manner which<br />\nshould denote the college man.<br />\nIt is generally accepted as true that a college education means more than mere<br />\n\"book-learning.\" In the admirable democracy which as a rule characterizes college life a man learns a great deal from contact with his fellows. It is not the<br />\ndig who gets the most out of a course at college, although he may rank easily<br />\nfirst in his classes, but it is the man who rubs elbows with his fellows who gets the<br />\nbetter training. If he learns to give hard blows, he also learns to bear them unflinchingly in return. If he gives up the careful influence of home life by going<br />\naway to college, he gets in return a confidence and a self-reliance which will stand<br />\nhim in good stead in the future. But are all these things conducive to good mantiers? Not at all. They give self-control, self-reliance, and confidence, but they<br />\ndo not necessarily give that urbanity of manner which should designate the<br />\ncollege man.<br />\nOne thing which marks the decay of manners among college men is the<br />\nlack of personal interest between the instructor and his class. It is not the fault<br />\nof one more than the other. In this present day and generation the instructor<br />\nis so busily engaged in his research work that he has little time to devote to his<br />\nclasses. It is true that he grudgingly gives an hour to the men who are consigned to his care, but after the close of that hour he might as well be an inhabitant of another planet. ITe is engrossed in the studies which he hopes will make<br />\nhis name famous, but in his selfish seclusion he forgets that there is a duty which<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nhe owes to the students. He is engaged in making scholars of them, if such a<br />\nthing is possible, but at any cost he should try to make men of them, men in every<br />\nsense of the word. That should stand before everything else; that is what a<br />\ncollege education should do, if nothing else can ever be accomplished.<br />\nWe hear much of the influence exerted upon the men of the first half of the<br />\nnineteenth century by their professors at college. This is particularly true of that<br />\ncoterie of famous men who obtained their training in the smaller colleges of New<br />\nEngland. The professor was in personal touch with the men. He knew each<br />\none ; he knew his struggles, his weaknesses, his temptations, and his ambitions. A<br />\nkind word or a helping hand at the right time was the making of many a man.<br />\nThe perplexed youth knew that there was a sympathetic ear into which he could<br />\npour his troubles. He knew that he had a kind friend who was always willing to<br />\nbe a guide. and a counselor. Consequently those men received a training which<br />\nwas of 'inestimable value.<br />\nThere is another side. No one would believe for a moment that it is all the<br />\nfault of the instructor; far from it. The colleges to which reference has just been<br />\nmade were all small institutions. It was easily possible for the president of the<br />\nuniversity to know personally every man. To-day such a thing is out of the<br />\nquestion. The large colleges and universities have from one to four thousand<br />\nstudents. The professor reads his lectures to a large class of men, few of whom<br />\nhe would know if he met them on the street. Jn such a case it would be absurd<br />\nto expect that close union which does so much for the undergraduate. It can not<br />\nbe denied that even in the majority of cases where the professor makes advances<br />\nto the men in the class he is repulsed, because they seem to take a delight in<br />\nimposing upon a man who tries to introduce any binding tie of comradeship. The<br />\nresult is not a satisfactory one to either side.<br />\nThis lack of sympathy between the professor and his men may be one of the<br />\ncauses of the decay of college manners. The college man is left to his own<br />\ndevices, he is thrown upon his own resources. Does the professor care how the<br />\nman spends his time outside the classroom? Apparently not. Does he know<br />\nwhether that man is engaged in playing football, or in playing the slot machine,<br />\nwhether he is sitting at a table studying, or sitting at a table drawing to three<br />\njacks and a queen? If he guesses it from his knowledge of the man gained in<br />\nthe classroom he never makes any use of that interesting information. If the man<br />\nmaintains a passing grade he lives his life as he pleases to the end of the chapter.<br />\nThe author of \"Observations in a Big University\" asserts that the men who<br />\nwork their way through college are only so much dead Wood, and that for them<br />\neducation has no refining value. But such an argument can not be advanced to<br />\nstrengthen the claim that college manners have deteriorated. These men are not<br />\nso much dead wood ; they can be found in every college taking an active interest<br />\nin all the pure sports and recreations in which college students delight. Colleges<br />\nneed more of them. A man who is working his way is serious in his pursuit of<br />\nknowledge; he has a definite aim in life and he is getting an education because it<br />\nwill further that aim. Such graduates are better advertisements for a college<br /><br />\n. THE NEWS LETTER.<br />\nthan the men who go to college for the social standing it will give them or because the only other alternative is to go to work.<br />\nThere was once a time when it was truly an honor to be a college man. Now<br />\nit is very different. Men seem to go through college without giving a thought<br />\nto the fact that they are receiving a training which is far more comprehensive and<br />\nmore thorough than that which falls to the lot of most young men. And because<br />\nit ,has lost that certain dignity in the eyes of the men themselves it can no longer<br />\nmaintain that dignity in the eyes of others. If the college man refuses to accept<br />\nhimself seriously, how can he expect others to do so?<br />\nWe should imagine that the best, the purest English would be spoken by<br />\ncollege men. If the purity of the English language is to be preserved, who will<br />\npreserve it if not the men who are trained by education? But the fact is that there<br />\nare no more inveterate users of slang, as a class, than college men. Perhaps the<br />\nbest criterion of a man is the language he uses ; if that is the case the public would<br />\nbe warranted in declaring that college manners are not what they once were, and<br />\nthat education no longer exerts a refining influence.<br />\nA college education does not in itself exert a refining influence. It should<br />\nteach a man to separate the true from the false, to recognize the true and to<br />\nappreciate it. Yet it can not compel him to do so. The writer of this article may<br />\nhave gone far afield in attempting to find causes for this lack of manners, and he<br />\nis fully conscious that he has offered no suggestion which in any way can help in<br />\narriving at a solution of the problem. All that he has done, and all that he has<br />\nattempted to do, is to throw some light upon some of the apparent causes.<br /><br />\nSENIORS WIN DEBATE.<br />\nII V, sixth annual inter-class debate, now rapidly fading into remote college<br />\n_ history, was outwardly very much like its fine predecessors. There was<br />\nthe same dignified march with mandolin accompaniment, the same neat<br />\nintroduction by the President, the usual time-honored gags by Dr. Lee, and the<br />\nsame impassional oratorical assault and repulse. The debate recalled the contest<br />\nof last year, particularly, because the class of 1903 was represented by precisely<br />\nthe same team and that team won.<br />\nAs usual the decision of the judges failed to please everybody, least of all<br />\nthe losing class ; but to the disinterested spectator it seemed as fair as any such<br />\ndecision can be. Clearly the seniors won on delivery. Their advantage in argument, if they had any at all, was certainly very slight.<br />\nPlaggemeyer was all that was expected of him, deliberate, easy, and finished,<br />\ntoo finished, perhaps, so that he suggested the danger of over-training. A slight<br />\ntinge of Licking's tempestuous enthusiasm would have done him no harm. Blum,<br />\nwithout his sarcasm and with more of a set speech, did better than last year, and<br />\nStrayer for some reason did not seem to do himself justice. Humrichouse is<br />\non the way toward effective work, and another year when he is more at home on<br />\nthe platform, will doubtless give a better account of himself. The dead-level<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nmonotony of Rosenheim's speech was more than relieved by the variety and abar<br />\ndon of Licking's. To those who have occasionally dropped in on the training Licking's performance seemed quite a tour de force. He overdid the part, to be sure,<br />\nand his style, taking as it was at first, soon began to pall on the audience which<br />\nit had stirred into generous good humor. His speech, however, was not merely<br />\n\"hot air,\" to use a classic bit of debating slang; a good deal of it was really effective refutation,all the more to be commended because it had the air of being frankly<br />\nspontaneous.<br />\nThis quality, by the way, was unfortunately lacking in most of the other<br />\nspeeches. Debaters have learned by experience that a carefully-written memorized<br />\nspeech, comfortably and calmly delivered, is more apt to win than a string of<br />\nhalting, ill-phrased rejoinders. They ought to learn further that the speech of a<br />\nman who knows his subject and has learned by practice to think about it on his<br />\nfeet and to put his thoughts into decent English on the spot, is much better than<br />\neither.<br />\nThere is good reason, of course, why the .first speeches on both sides should<br />\nbe memorized word for word and delivered with as much art as weeks of training<br />\ncan inculcate; but there is no reason why the following speakers, or the first ones<br />\neither, for that matter, should have frequent recourse to the formula, \"my opponents will doubtless say,\" and then proceed to demolish the arguments which they<br />\nhave themselves set up. It is a good thing to know what one's opponents are going<br />\nto say, but it is wise to let them say it first. More than one good speech has gone<br />\nwide of the mark because the preceding speaker did not do what was expected of<br />\nhim, and it was too late to change the polished phrases for something more<br />\nappropriate.<br />\nAside from the fact that it furnished a last opportunity for the classes of 1903<br />\nand 1904 to try conclusions, the debate was interesting as a preliminary contest<br />\nto the inter-collegiate debate with North Carolina. Last year the visitors won by<br />\na very narrow margin. We have now an opportunity to return the compliment.<br />\nIf the men chosen to represent us will take the lessons of that debate and the recent<br />\none to their hearts, and if the undergraduates, as a body, will encourage the team<br />\nwith enthusiastic support, there is no reason why we may not beat North Carolina<br />\non her own grounds.<br />\nThe debate was preceded by the Freshmen speaking contest. The Lee prize<br />\nfor excellence in public speaking was awarded to Goldman, who delivered l'earre's<br />\naddress on Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Straugn and Zeigler were the other<br />\nspeakers.<br />\nCONCERNING THE EASTER TRIP OF THE MUSICAL CLUBS<br />\nu RING the many meetings of the Fernandis Club there has been so much<br />\ndiscussion about the Easter trip of the Musical Clubs that an explanation<br />\nis perhaps permissible.<br />\nSince this is the first year in the history of the clubs that Old Point Comfort<br />\nhas not been visited at Easter, it has caused much wonder and no little criticism<br /><br />\nsp<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n!*<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nconcerning the management.<br />\nFi'om the beginning of the collegiate year, until a few weeks ago, there was<br />\nnot the slightest doubt that the Hopkins men would once more enjoy their Spring<br />\nvacation at Fortress Monroe. There was every reason to believe that all plans<br />\nwould be sucessful, for a contract signed by the manager of the Chamberlin and<br />\nHygeia Hotels and the manager of the Musical Clubs was supposed to be sufficiently<br />\nbinding.<br />\nSince the signing of the contracts, however, the Chamberlin Hotel has<br />\nchanged managers, and the Hygeia is a thing of the past.<br />\nLast week a representative of the clubs was sent to Old Point to find if some<br />\npossible arrangements might be made by which the usual Easter trip could be<br />\ntaken.<br />\nAll argument was fruitless for the Hotel Chamberlin, even at that early date,<br />\nwas well crowded, and every room in the house was already engaged for the<br />\none time when Fortress Monroe awakens to life. Whether the hotel management<br />\nwas aware of the contract made earlier in the year is a matter of speculation. The<br />\nlegal status of the contract seemed to need no further investigation.<br />\nOf course, technically, the responsibility of the hotel is not shifted by the<br />\nchange in managers; but as the contract was signed by the managers of the clubs,<br />\na minor, the contract could not be valid. Then again, the Musical Clubs are not<br />\na legal organization, and so a contract signed in their behalf would be purely a<br />\npersonal matter.<br />\nThis will perhaps clear the legal atmosphere, and show that the trip was not<br />\nlost through the negligence on the part of the manager.<br />\nIt was hinted that the conduct of the men in past years might account for the<br />\nclubs not being able to return to Old Point. This was most assuredly not the<br />\ncase, for there was less disorder last year than ever before. Indeed, the manager<br />\nof the hotels complimented the men on their excellent order.<br />\nIn discussing the situation this year, the new manager seemed to be governed<br />\nalniost entirely by the scarcity of accommodations. It may be consoling to those<br />\nmost interested to know that the Yale Base Ball Team has been unsuccessful in<br />\nits efforts to play its annual game at Old Point with the Artillery School. The<br />\nCornell Musical Club were also so desirous of being at Old Point during the Easter<br />\nholidays that they sent their manager down to Old Point to engage accommodations. In this they were unsuccessful.<br />\nWhere the clubs will go is still more interesting than why they will not go to<br />\ntheir usual \"loafing grounds ;\" but on this subject there is really a sad dearth of<br />\ninformation.<br />\n\u2014 Several places are being considered, and everything possible is being done to<br />\nfind some place that will offer similar attractions to those offered by Old Point<br />\nComfort.<br />\nIf it were earlier in the year, a trip to Atlantic City might be a possibility ;<br />\nbut at this late date an attempt to make such an expensive trip is out of the question. The most plausible plans include the \"old Christmas trip\" to Winchester,<br />\nVa.,Charlestown, W. Va.., Cambridge, and Easton of lower Maryland.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nPublished Fortnightly during the University Year by the Studr\u2022nts of THE JOHNS<br />\nHOPKINS UNIVERSITY.<br /><br />\nAPRIL 2, 1903.<br /><br />\nSubscription $1.50 per year.<br /><br />\nEditor in Chief, .<br />\nAssociate Editor in Chief,<br />\nNews Editor,<br />\n.<br />\nAssistant News Editors,<br />\nAthletic Editors,<br />\nBusiness Manager,<br />\nAssistant Business Manager,<br /><br />\n10 Cents a single copy.<br /><br />\n.<br /><br />\nHARRY K.

All previous games pale into insignificence when compared with them, and they will be<br />\nthe standard by which future games must be judged. We have yet to find the<br />\nman who has a complaint to make. Mr, Hoffman, Mr. Dulany, Mr. Mackdermott, and the Games Committee have reached the highwater mark of athletic<br />\nsuccess. Hopkins has always stood for what is purest and best in athletics, and<br />\nthe splendid support given the games by the citizens of Baltimore bore witness<br />\nto the fact that the efforts of the University in striving to maintain a high standard<br />\nhave received universal recognition.<br />\nIn the first place the officials were selected solely on account of their fitness;<br />\nthere was not one who was not thoroughly competent, and no competitor was<br />\ngiven an undue advantage on account of ignorance on the part of an official. The<br />\nUniversity was fortunate in having secured the services of Mr. M. J. Thompson<br />\nof Georgetown as referee, and the selection of such a man was a guarantee that<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nnothing but the wisest decisions would be rendered. As clerk of the course Mr.<br />\nMackdtrmott was well fitted for the position through his long experience with<br />\nathletics. We were glad to see that it was not necessary to run trial heats in the<br />\nafternoon. Perhaps the best compliment of the evening came from the newspaper men. 'Mr. Mackdermott is a wonder,\" said one, \"he is running off events<br />\nwith such a snap that we can't keep up with him.\"<br />\nAthletically, our track team made an excellent showing, and the University<br />\nhas good reason to be proud of its representatives. Every man ran for all that<br />\nwas in him, and win or lose he helped maintain the glory of Hopkins. The success of this meet makes our visit to Virginia an assured fact, and in the dual meet<br />\nwe hope to give the Virginians the hardest tussle they have ever had.<br /><br />\ns its leading article for this issue THE Nims-LErrER publishes a short criticism of \"College Men and Manners.\" The article is purely an academic<br />\none, and has no reference to the Johns Hopkins University. In fact this<br />\nUniversity may be regarded as in a class by itself, and it very often happens that<br />\nconditions which exist at other institutions can have no analogue here. Consequently many of the observations made on the relations of the students and the<br />\nfaculty are entirely inapplicable to Hopkins. Some of the undergraduates have<br />\ncomplained, however, that the faculty do not support the student body in the matter<br />\nof athletics. Their contention is in part a fair one. They are wrong in imagining that they should have the support of the entire faculty, because there are a<br />\ngreat number who are thrown in contact with the undergraduates, and it would<br />\nbe asking too much to expect them to witness an athletic game in which they had<br />\nno interest. But we have a right to expect those members of the faculty who are<br />\nengaged in teaching undergraduates to turn out to our games. On next Saturday the lacrosse team plays the first game of the season. On that occasion the<br />\nwhole University, if possible, should be present to do honor to the 1 earn which more<br />\nthan any other upholds the athletic renown of-the University.<br /><br />\nl<br /><br />\nHE board of editors of the \"Hullabaloo\" are extremely anxious for the students to co-operate with them in preparing the book. There are numbers<br />\nof items of interest which they may never see unless brought to their attention by some one who is interested. Poetry, \"stunt\" club, grinds, and other<br />\nmaterial of a similar character is requested. Any man who is able to draw<br />\nwould be helping the board greatly if he would turn his talent to account in assisting to make the book a success. There is only a week left in which matter can be<br />\nturned in, and those who are thinking of contributing will confer a favor on the<br />\neditors if they hand in their contributions at once.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LF,TTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nnimiumumillInimmilluiumnimM11011111111110111101111111111111111 OillielitIlliiimmn001111111111 MIK1011111111111ffiulillill niI<br /><br />\n01..migge_0.0%,01<br />\nperailliag<br />\nMIN<br /><br />\nmen301.11.4\u201e,mono.:<br /><br />\ni5411111<br />\nonedscidealallo.Imalonl.mat<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n1`<br />\n.\"1g41<br /><br />\nMMINON11110111WIIIOMPINION<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins Club has decided to vacate its present clubhouse in June, and is<br />\nlooking for a house nearer the University.<br />\nOn the night of March 19, Dr. George B.

The meet was the most successful ever held<br />\nin this section, and fully realized the highest expectations of those who had been<br />\nmost sanguine of success. From beginning to end, one event followed another<br />\nin rapid succession, thus eliminating those long, tedious delays that usually occur<br />\nto diminish the enjoyment of such events ; furthermore, the usual crowded infield<br />\nwas lacking, none but officials and a few contestants being allowed inside the track,<br />\nso that the audience had a clear view of the entire field of action. Prof. Wm. M.<br />\nMackdermott. the Clerk of Course, and the other officials, have been highly commended for the able manner in which the games were conducted, and well may<br />\nthey. feel that their untiring efforts were productive of most satisfactory results.<br />\nIn addition to the customary events, Arthur F. Duffy of Georgetown University, who holds the world's record of 9 3-5 seconds for 100 yards, gave an exhibition 35-yard dash, equaling the present world's record of 4.,seconds fiat. The<br />\nRelay Races, of which there were ten, were unusually interesting and exciting,<br />\nespecially those between M. A. C. and B. A. C., between the Emerson Institute<br />\nof Washington and 'Marston's. Hopkins unfortunately was unable to secure a<br />\nworthy team to compete with her.<br />\nHopkins easily made the best showing of any organization represented. In<br />\neach of the events in which her men were entered, at least one of them always<br />\nsecured a place. Individual honors were carried off by Harry K. Tootle who distinguished himself by captivating three firsts\u2014in the 35-yard scratch and 35-yard<br />\nopen handicap dashes, and in the .140-yard handicap. In the 35-yard handicap<br />\nPessagno broke the State record, his time being 4. 1-5 seconds. J. A. Freeze was a<br />\nclose second to Tootle for first honors, finishing first in both the Shot Put and 40yard hurdle, and second in the 440-yard handicap.<br />\nFollowing is a brief summary of the events that are of special interest to<br />\nHopkins men:<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS LETTER.<br />\n35-YARD DASH\u2014SCRATCH.<br /><br />\nH.

His success was short lived as in the handicap<br />\ndash Pessagno, who was scratch man, in one of the trial heats lowered the record<br />\nto 4 1-5 seconds. This fact was overlooked at the time, perhaps owing to the fact<br />\nthat it occurred in a handicap dash. Since he came within 1-5 of a second of the<br />\nworld's record M r.

When<br />\nwe also consider the fact that Hopkins will hardly turn out as strong a team as<br />\nthat of last season, and that Pennsy is growing stronger each year, it may easily<br />\nbe seen that the game Saturday is apt to be well contested.<br />\nFor several weeks past the Hopkins squad has been doing steady, faithful<br />\nwork on the Druid Hill Park campus, and the results have for the most part been<br />\nvery encouraging. Team work has gradually developed and the men have daily<br />\nshown better form and condition.<br />\nFrom the present outlook, it may safely be said that at no time in the history<br />\nof Hopkins lacrosse have the new candidates had a better chance to figure in one<br />\nor more contests during the season. This is especially true of the attack. Should<br />\nB. Bernheim be unable to fill his old position at out home, foul' places out of the<br />\nsix will be open. Putts is the remaining home man, and Bird is the only midfield<br />\nman left from last year's attack. Matthai and Strohbar seem reasonably sure of<br />\npositions, and should they play at centre and first attack respectively, with Putts<br />\nat inhome and Bird at third attack, second attack and outhome will still be vacant.<br />\nFor these positions Foster, Taylor, Hoffman, Dill and Pearre are dividing honors.<br />\nFoster, it will be remembered, played on the 1900 championship team, and should<br />\nhe find time for practice, will prove a very available man.<br />\nThe defense did not suffer such severe losses at the close of the past season,<br />\nCaptain Schmeisser being the only man to graduate. From present prospects<br />\nE. Schmeisser and Blanck will mow back one position, thus leaving second defense vacant. Custis will probably make the place.<br />\nThe schedule as 'arranged by Manager J. A. Addison is undoubtedly one of<br />\nthe hardest we have ever faced. Not only is Stevens Institute an extra antagonist<br />\nfor the possession of the championship pennant, but the Crescent Athletic Club<br />\nand the Toronto Twelve are to be played.
