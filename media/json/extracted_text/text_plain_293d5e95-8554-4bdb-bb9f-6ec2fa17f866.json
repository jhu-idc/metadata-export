But of course the Council's perks<br />\naren't \"conspicuous consumption,\" are<br />\nthey? Of course not, because they are<br />\nstretched out over nine months and<br />\nhidden under a veil of \"official business\"<br />\nbullshit.

Can the Council<br />\nmake the same claims?<br />\nS2000 is a large piece of change,<br />\nbut in this case it is justified. The many<br />\npeople who volunteered for Spring Fair<br />\nhave been busting their butts for five<br />\nmonths in order to bring about a fine<br />\nthing--not only for Hopkins, but for<br />\nBaltimore and the entire state as well. To<br />\nnow use them as scapegoats so that<br />\ncertain Council members can loudly<br />\nproclaim their \"fiscal responsibility\"<br />\nwould be to see deserving, dedicated<br />\npeople get a truely royal screwing.

Idealistically, council<br />\nmembers are representatives of<br />\nthe students who speak and act<br />\nfor these constituents. However,<br />\nwhenever any controversial subject arises, there will be some<br />\nmembers who, if the meeting is<br />\nopen, not say something because<br />\nthey believe that they might<br />\nhurt a friend or fear some<br />\nrepercussions. This should never<br />\nhappen because council members must always be open with<br />\ntheir ideas and opinions. For<br />\nthis reason, the meetings should<br />\nalways be open, but council<br />\nmembers are not this way and<br />\ndo keep in their thoughts.

It's a simple matter of<br />\nmaking it clear who's the boss. You won't feed<br />\nher dog food more than once. Those scars are<br />\nthere for life. Adjusting to being perpetually<br />\nunder the claw of your adolescent cat is otherwise a gradual and relatively painless process.

There is no depth too low for him to<br />\nstoop to have his existence acknowledged by the<br />\nmerest twitch of an ear. People address a cat in a<br />\nmanner they wouldn't use with a Martian. They<br />\nscrew their faces up and exclaim, \"Is a baby?<br />\nDoes a love? Is a kissy cat?\"<br />\nPeople think their childish vagaries are<br />\nsafe with a cat. Don't bet on it. Cats love to tell<br />\nstories. They eavesdrop. They run up your<br />\nphone bill. The next time you pass a strange cat<br />\nin the neighborhood and it starts rolling around<br />\non the grass, holding its sides, you'll know why.<br />\nCats are not without their emotional<br />\nmoments, however. They have certain passions--even those who have had \"that operation.\" Besides telling stories, there are a wide<br />\nvariety of things that cats love to do.<br />\n<br />\nCats love to look like you<br />\nIt's really true that, as time goes by, cats<br />\nand owners seem more and more to resemble<br />\none another. This is<br />\nusually the fault of<br />\nthe cat. She imitates<br />\nyour facial expression<br />\nand nervous mannerisms. Your friends<br />\ncall you up and they<br />\nthink she's you. She likes to wear your clothes.<br />\n<br />\nCats love to bring you presents<br />\nLike dead mice. And dead birds. And<br />\nsquirrel entrails. And fleas...lots and lots of fleas.<br />\n<br />\nCats love to protect you<br />\n<br />\nCats love to be mysterious<br />\nThey revel in knowing that they're \"the<br />\nunsuspected.\" They get a real charge out of<br />\nstanding over your<br />\nbed at night and<br />\nflashing their big<br />\nluminous eyes at<br />\nyou.

Or the 100,000 British cats<br />\nemployed in the Civil Service. I talk to her about<br />\nfelines who have made big names for themselves.<br />\nThere's Hellcat and Brownie, the world's richest<br />\ncats, with a legacy of $415,000. Or Thumper,<br />\nwho survived 52 days trapped in a mine shaft<br />\nwithout food or water. She's impressed by the<br />\nrecord of the world's best ratter, Mickey, who<br />\ntoked up 12,480 kills in six years. Or Mickey,<br />\nthe best mouser, who slew over 22,000 in his 23<br />\nyears of service. Her favorite, however, seems to<br />\nbe 17-year-old Dusty, who holds the title for the<br />\nworld's most prolific puss at 402 kittens.<br />\nI tell Cassandra how her kind warmed the<br />\nfeet of Edgar Allan Poe's child-wife during one<br />\nwinter in an unheated apartment. Or how Dick<br />\nWhittington's cat helped this poor boy to<br />\nbecome Lord Mayor of London. Or about the<br />\nfamous Cheshire Cat who appeared in various<br />\nstates of visibility to Alice in Lewis Carroll's<br />\nclassic.<br />\n<br />\nBut they have a warped sense of humor<br />\nby our standards. It's like living with the Katzenjammer Kids. Just try to get a cat to play one of<br />\nyour games, like Monopoly. They only want to<br />\nnibble on the pieces. Cats want to play cat<br />\ngames and they want to play them with your<br />\nstuff. They play games like: ,\"Bat the Contact<br />\nLens Across the Floor:\" and \"Let's Pretend That<br />\nPonytail Is A Snake.\" Cats love to see how much<br />\nof themselves they can squeeze into small<br />\nenclosures, like yourshoe. They also enjoy<br />\ntheir collections: jewelry, dead spiders, Harlequin romances, campaign buttons.<br />\nCats have always demanded a certain<br />\namount of homage from humans. The Egyptians<br />\nequated the cat with the goddess Bast, who<br />\ngoverned moonlight, fertility, wisdom and<br />\nhunting. When a cat died, the whole household<br />\nwent into mourning. The cat was mummified<br />\nand placed in a tomb. In case it should get the<br />\nmunchies in the afterlife, a mummified mouse<br />\nwas interred beside it.<br />\nCats today assume that a certain amount of<br />\ngroveling goes with the territory. The predatory<br />\ntwitch of the tail clues<br />\nyou when she doesn't<br />\nthink you've done<br />\n(CHUNK! your time. Even if this<br />\nescapes you, you'll<br />\nfind out soon enough.<br />\nShe scales the drapes<br />\n(overweight cats only<br />\ntry this once).

The balding one, Rossino,<br />\nnotices that his friend Nicky seems<br />\nremote, taken aback. \"What is past is<br />\npast,\" Rossino says, gravely. Then, with<br />\na bright smile and a step toward his<br />\nfamily, he changes his tone. \"Forget<br />\nyour mother!\" he tells Nicky. \"Forget<br />\nyour father! Forget Venice! But avanti,<br />\nalways avanti!\"<br />\nThis is the theme of Franco<br />\nBrusati's Dimenticare Venezia(To Forget<br />\nVenice) -- the pains and joys of a family<br />\ndeeply rooted in the past trying to adapt<br />\nto the ever-changing, ever advancing<br />\npresent. Against a backdrop of death and<br />\nemotional scars, Brusati's cinematography<br />\nsuperimposes life, light, and levity -creating a world whose changes sweep<br />\neveryone down the road of experience,<br />\nletting none stagnate sulkily in the past.<br />\nii<br />\n<br />\nErland Josephson and HeIla Petri<br />\n<br />\nTo Forget Venice revolves around<br />\nthe family of Aunt Martha, a retired<br />\nopera star. Her death removes the stable<br />\nfocal point of the others' lives and forces<br />\nthem to face their fears and adapt to the<br />\nAnna, the niece of Aunt<br />\npresent.<br />\nMartha's first husband, has been emotionally brutalized as a child by her<br />\nneurotic, lovesick mother, and until the<br />\ncatharsis caused by Aunt Martha's death,<br />\nshe can release emotion only in brief,<br />\nhateful outbursts. Claudia, her lover and<br />\ngirlhood friend, is a virgin's virgin; she is<br />\nfearful and disgusted at her flow of<br />\nmenstrual blood and at the two young<br />\nlovers she sees having intercourse in the<br />\nNicky, Martha's brother, has<br />\npark.<br />\ntraveled many places but has never really<br />\nfound another home. And Caterina, the<br />\nnanny, finds solace in traditional values -only gypsies go out to eat, she believes,<br />\nand good girls wear their pametto (sun<br />\nhat).<br />\nThough its theme is adaptation to<br />\nchange, Brusati Oyes us only a quick<br />\nglimpse of the direction of the characters'<br />\nnew lives. Most of the movie concerns<br />\nthe build-up to the inevitable, which<br />\ninvolves an intricate sequence of flashbacks, old stories, and chance meetings.<br />\nThe flashbacks are especially well filmed,<br />\npaced, and acted. Anna's memory of her<br />\nfirst meeting with Claudia does much to<br />\nexplain their present relationship. It is<br />\nFirst Communion Day, and the two girls<br />\nrare both in white dresses and veils.<br />\n!Claudia quietly tiptoes up the ladder to<br />\nthe attic and offers Anna some cake. At<br />\nfirst Anna refuses Claudia's friendship but<br />\nthen invites her to throw darts and eggs<br />\nand a large picture of a man and a woman. When Claudia finds out that these<br />\nare Anna's parents, she begins to cry.<br />\nAnna asks her what will console her<br />\nsome cake? a walk downstairs? But<br />\nClaudia wants none of these; she turns to<br />\nAnna and hugs her fiercely.

The one scene that so excellently<br />\ncombines all three is clearly the highpoint<br />\nof the film. While his sister lies dying in<br />\nher bedroom, Nicky sits on the stairs<br />\nremembering how his father conjured up<br />\nthe spirits of Wealth, Beauty, and Love<br />\nfor Martha's twelfth birthday. He then<br />\nremembers that his father asked him to<br />\ngive something to Martha, who how had<br />\neverything.

LEWIS<br />\nIf their last album, Animals, was<br />\nperhaps the ideal soundtrack for Animal<br />\nFarm, Pink Floyd's latest is comparable<br />\nto a youth version of 1984. The Wall<br />\nis a majestic and desolate double album<br />\nmicrocosm of hysterically screaming<br />\nteachers, blaring TVs, and frightening<br />\ntunes narrating soma-appeased insecurity<br />\nand anomie. \"Mother do you think<br />\nthey'll break my balls?\" It is equally<br />\nimpressive on the sonic side, with a<br />\nmelange of sound effects matched only<br />\nby Tomita and Carlos, masters of schlock<br />\nsonic spectacularism (In a favorite splice a<br />\nshowroom of babbling TVs are smashed,<br />\nset by set). Musical styles range from<br />\nclassical guitar in the haunting \"Is There<br />\nAnybody Out There?\" to \"The Trial\" a<br />\nla Gilbert & Sullivan & Rice & Webber,<br />\nand of course the sub-disco rhythm with<br />\nadded kiddie chorus that shoved \"Another Brick in the Wall\" into AM & FM.<br />\nClandestine cassettes are no doubt even<br />\nnow circulating those infamous lyrics<br />\namong the impoverished and repressed<br />\nkiddies of the world \"We don't need no<br />\neducation.

The brilliant colors of the make-up and costumes,<br />\nthe energy radiated by the dancers, the<br />\nsweet tempo of the music, and the look<br />\nof the innocent rapture on the children's<br />\nfaces are proof of Brusati's genius.<br />\nCapturing pure movement, allegria, has<br />\ntradiationally been the province of Italian<br />\nmasters. For this scene, Brusati deserves<br />\na place among them.<br />\nBrusati's treatment of sadness, on<br />\nthe other hand, is merely competent. His<br />\ncharacters are powerful despite their<br />\nweaknesses. Far from tragic, they seem<br />\nperfectly capcable of conquering their<br />\nfears and starting a new life. The final<br />\nscene, however, in which Nicky discovers<br />\nMartha's crystal ball in the garden and<br />\nbreaks it against a tree, is superfluous and<br />\nheavy-handedly symbolic.<br />\nThe cast of To Forget Venice is<br />\noutstanding. Marianegela Melata (Anna),<br />\nbest known for her role in Swept Away,<br />\nlashes out powerfully, desperately in her<br />\nfull, earthy voice. Elenora Giorgi (Claudia) is fundamentally innocent and impervious to emotional scarring\u2014the perfect<br />\nfoil for Anna's aggression. Giorgi's white,<br />\ndoughy face provides sharp contrast with<br />\nMelata's bronzed skin and angular<br />\nfeatures. Though not as striking as the<br />\ntwo women, Erland Josephson (Nicky)<br />\nand David Pontremoli (Pug, his young<br />\nlover) also turn in good performances.<br />\nPontremoli maintains the same cheerful<br />\ninnocence as Claudia.

Idealistically, council<br />\nmembers are representatives of<br />\nthe students who speak and act<br />\nfor these constituents. However,<br />\nwhenever any controversial subject arises, there will be some<br />\nmembers who, if the meeting is<br />\nopen, not say something because<br />\nthey believe that they might<br />\nhurt a friend or fear some<br />\nrepercussions. This should never<br />\nhappen because council members must always be open with<br />\ntheir ideas and opinions. For<br />\nthis reason, the meetings should<br />\nalways be open, but council<br />\nmembers are not this way and<br />\ndo keep in their thoughts.

Adjusting to being perpetually<br />\nunder the claw of your adolescent cat is otherwise a gradual and relatively painless process.

There is no depth too low for him to<br />\nstoop to have his existence acknowledged by the<br />\nmerest twitch of an ear. People address a cat in a<br />\nmanner they wouldn't use with a Martian. They<br />\nscrew their faces up and exclaim, \"Is a baby?<br />\nDoes a love? Is a kissy cat?\"<br />\nPeople think their childish vagaries are<br />\nsafe with a cat. Don't bet on it. Cats love to tell<br />\nstories. They eavesdrop. They run up your<br />\nphone bill. The next time you pass a strange cat<br />\nin the neighborhood and it starts rolling around<br />\non the grass, holding its sides, you'll know why.<br />\nCats are not without their emotional<br />\nmoments, however. They have certain passions--even those who have had \"that operation.\" Besides telling stories, there are a wide<br />\nvariety of things that cats love to do.<br /><br />\nCats love to look like you<br />\nIt's really true that, as time goes by, cats<br />\nand owners seem more and more to resemble<br />\none another. This is<br />\nusually the fault of<br />\nthe cat. She imitates<br />\nyour facial expression<br />\nand nervous mannerisms. Your friends<br />\ncall you up and they<br />\nthink she's you. She likes to wear your clothes.<br /><br />\nCats love to bring you presents<br />\nLike dead mice. And dead birds. And<br />\nsquirrel entrails. And fleas...lots and lots of fleas.<br /><br />\nCats love to protect you<br /><br />\nCats love to be mysterious<br />\nThey revel in knowing that they're \"the<br />\nunsuspected.\" They get a real charge out of<br />\nstanding over your<br />\nbed at night and<br />\nflashing their big<br />\nluminous eyes at<br />\nyou.

Or Thumper,<br />\nwho survived 52 days trapped in a mine shaft<br />\nwithout food or water. She's impressed by the<br />\nrecord of the world's best ratter, Mickey, who<br />\ntoked up 12,480 kills in six years. Or Mickey,<br />\nthe best mouser, who slew over 22,000 in his 23<br />\nyears of service. Her favorite, however, seems to<br />\nbe 17-year-old Dusty, who holds the title for the<br />\nworld's most prolific puss at 402 kittens.<br />\nI tell Cassandra how her kind warmed the<br />\nfeet of Edgar Allan Poe's child-wife during one<br />\nwinter in an unheated apartment.

Or about the<br />\nfamous Cheshire Cat who appeared in various<br />\nstates of visibility to Alice in Lewis Carroll's<br />\nclassic.<br /><br />\nBut they have a warped sense of humor<br />\nby our standards. It's like living with the Katzenjammer Kids. Just try to get a cat to play one of<br />\nyour games, like Monopoly. They only want to<br />\nnibble on the pieces. Cats want to play cat<br />\ngames and they want to play them with your<br />\nstuff. They play games like: ,\"Bat the Contact<br />\nLens Across the Floor:\" and \"Let's Pretend That<br />\nPonytail Is A Snake.\" Cats love to see how much<br />\nof themselves they can squeeze into small<br />\nenclosures, like yourshoe. They also enjoy<br />\ntheir collections: jewelry, dead spiders, Harlequin romances, campaign buttons.<br />\nCats have always demanded a certain<br />\namount of homage from humans. The Egyptians<br />\nequated the cat with the goddess Bast, who<br />\ngoverned moonlight, fertility, wisdom and<br />\nhunting. When a cat died, the whole household<br />\nwent into mourning. The cat was mummified<br />\nand placed in a tomb. In case it should get the<br />\nmunchies in the afterlife, a mummified mouse<br />\nwas interred beside it.<br />\nCats today assume that a certain amount of<br />\ngroveling goes with the territory. The predatory<br />\ntwitch of the tail clues<br />\nyou when she doesn't<br />\nthink you've done<br />\n(CHUNK! your time. Even if this<br />\nescapes you, you'll<br />\nfind out soon enough.<br />\nShe scales the drapes<br />\n(overweight cats only<br />\ntry this once). Or races<br />\naround the room,<br />\nbounding from object to object like a tennis<br />\nball. Or exercises her claws on your Chuck Berry<br />\nrecord. Or uses her tail to edge your glass of<br />\nmilk over the side of the table.<br /><br />\nThey know what's best. What's best is<br />\nwhat they want. It's best for you to get up with<br />\nthem at 5:30 in the morning. That's why they<br />\njump on your face.

The balding one, Rossino,<br />\nnotices that his friend Nicky seems<br />\nremote, taken aback. \"What is past is<br />\npast,\" Rossino says, gravely. Then, with<br />\na bright smile and a step toward his<br />\nfamily, he changes his tone. \"Forget<br />\nyour mother!\" he tells Nicky. \"Forget<br />\nyour father! Forget Venice! But avanti,<br />\nalways avanti!\"<br />\nThis is the theme of Franco<br />\nBrusati's Dimenticare Venezia(To Forget<br />\nVenice) -- the pains and joys of a family<br />\ndeeply rooted in the past trying to adapt<br />\nto the ever-changing, ever advancing<br />\npresent. Against a backdrop of death and<br />\nemotional scars, Brusati's cinematography<br />\nsuperimposes life, light, and levity -creating a world whose changes sweep<br />\neveryone down the road of experience,<br />\nletting none stagnate sulkily in the past.<br />\nii<br /><br />\nErland Josephson and HeIla Petri<br /><br />\nTo Forget Venice revolves around<br />\nthe family of Aunt Martha, a retired<br />\nopera star. Her death removes the stable<br />\nfocal point of the others' lives and forces<br />\nthem to face their fears and adapt to the<br />\nAnna, the niece of Aunt<br />\npresent.<br />\nMartha's first husband, has been emotionally brutalized as a child by her<br />\nneurotic, lovesick mother, and until the<br />\ncatharsis caused by Aunt Martha's death,<br />\nshe can release emotion only in brief,<br />\nhateful outbursts. Claudia, her lover and<br />\ngirlhood friend, is a virgin's virgin; she is<br />\nfearful and disgusted at her flow of<br />\nmenstrual blood and at the two young<br />\nlovers she sees having intercourse in the<br />\nNicky, Martha's brother, has<br />\npark.<br />\ntraveled many places but has never really<br />\nfound another home. And Caterina, the<br />\nnanny, finds solace in traditional values -only gypsies go out to eat, she believes,<br />\nand good girls wear their pametto (sun<br />\nhat).<br />\nThough its theme is adaptation to<br />\nchange, Brusati Oyes us only a quick<br />\nglimpse of the direction of the characters'<br />\nnew lives. Most of the movie concerns<br />\nthe build-up to the inevitable, which<br />\ninvolves an intricate sequence of flashbacks, old stories, and chance meetings.<br />\nThe flashbacks are especially well filmed,<br />\npaced, and acted. Anna's memory of her<br />\nfirst meeting with Claudia does much to<br />\nexplain their present relationship. It is<br />\nFirst Communion Day, and the two girls<br />\nrare both in white dresses and veils.<br />\n!Claudia quietly tiptoes up the ladder to<br />\nthe attic and offers Anna some cake. At<br />\nfirst Anna refuses Claudia's friendship but<br />\nthen invites her to throw darts and eggs<br />\nand a large picture of a man and a woman. When Claudia finds out that these<br />\nare Anna's parents, she begins to cry.<br />\nAnna asks her what will console her<br />\nsome cake? a walk downstairs?

The one scene that so excellently<br />\ncombines all three is clearly the highpoint<br />\nof the film. While his sister lies dying in<br />\nher bedroom, Nicky sits on the stairs<br />\nremembering how his father conjured up<br />\nthe spirits of Wealth, Beauty, and Love<br />\nfor Martha's twelfth birthday.

LEWIS<br />\nIf their last album, Animals, was<br />\nperhaps the ideal soundtrack for Animal<br />\nFarm, Pink Floyd's latest is comparable<br />\nto a youth version of 1984. The Wall<br />\nis a majestic and desolate double album<br />\nmicrocosm of hysterically screaming<br />\nteachers, blaring TVs, and frightening<br />\ntunes narrating soma-appeased insecurity<br />\nand anomie. \"Mother do you think<br />\nthey'll break my balls?\" It is equally<br />\nimpressive on the sonic side, with a<br />\nmelange of sound effects matched only<br />\nby Tomita and Carlos, masters of schlock<br />\nsonic spectacularism (In a favorite splice a<br />\nshowroom of babbling TVs are smashed,<br />\nset by set). Musical styles range from<br />\nclassical guitar in the haunting \"Is There<br />\nAnybody Out There?\" to \"The Trial\" a<br />\nla Gilbert &amp; Sullivan &amp; Rice &amp; Webber,<br />\nand of course the sub-disco rhythm with<br />\nadded kiddie chorus that shoved \"Another Brick in the Wall\" into AM &amp; FM.<br />\nClandestine cassettes are no doubt even<br />\nnow circulating those infamous lyrics<br />\namong the impoverished and repressed<br />\nkiddies of the world \"We don't need no<br />\neducation.

For this scene, Brusati deserves<br />\na place among them.<br />\nBrusati's treatment of sadness, on<br />\nthe other hand, is merely competent. His<br />\ncharacters are powerful despite their<br />\nweaknesses. Far from tragic, they seem<br />\nperfectly capcable of conquering their<br />\nfears and starting a new life. The final<br />\nscene, however, in which Nicky discovers<br />\nMartha's crystal ball in the garden and<br />\nbreaks it against a tree, is superfluous and<br />\nheavy-handedly symbolic.<br />\nThe cast of To Forget Venice is<br />\noutstanding. Marianegela Melata (Anna),<br />\nbest known for her role in Swept Away,<br />\nlashes out powerfully, desperately in her<br />\nfull, earthy voice. Elenora Giorgi (Claudia) is fundamentally innocent and impervious to emotional scarring\u2014the perfect<br />\nfoil for Anna's aggression. Giorgi's white,<br />\ndoughy face provides sharp contrast with<br />\nMelata's bronzed skin and angular<br />\nfeatures. Though not as striking as the<br />\ntwo women, Erland Josephson (Nicky)<br />\nand David Pontremoli (Pug, his young<br />\nlover) also turn in good performances.<br />\nPontremoli maintains the same cheerful<br />\ninnocence as Claudia.
