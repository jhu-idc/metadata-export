At the basketball<br />\ngame versus our areh-rival from up Charles Street, Loyola, a week<br />\nago last Wednesday night, the Homewood Gymnasium was booming forth with the greatest amount of spirit shown by a partisan<br />\nsrowd in many-a-moon on this campus. In return for this<br />\nrevitalized spirit put forth by the Jay hoop fans, Coach Bilgrav's<br />\nquintet put on their most magnificent home performance of the<br />\nseason as they turned back the Greyhounds for the first time<br />\nsince the 1951 season.<br />\nGRAPPLERS FULL OF SPIRIT<br />\n<br />\nIt was a great feeling for this old senior to be a part of that<br />\nsupporting body, and brought back memories of the good-old<br />\n.days (freshman year).

It was the spirit and enthusiasm of this<br />\ngrand bunch of guys, who have battled through just about everything in the books to field a team, that brought Mickey Cochrane<br />\nhis second Mason-Dixon championship in two tries in this, his<br />\ninitial year.<br />\nThe fighting spirit of the entire participating Jay squad<br />\nwas actually more than all of the other teams in the tourney<br />\ntombined.

As a matter of<br />\nfact it would certainly be great to see another one of those mass<br />\nrallies before at least one of our lacrosse games. this year, like<br />\nthe one that occurred the night prior to the Princeton game in<br />\n\u2022<br />\n1951.<br />\nIt was on that Friday night in April when over 300 (believe<br />\n3t or not) Hopkins students paraded all the 'way down to<br />\nBaltimore Street and for the last time on record made known the<br />\nfact to this city that Hopkins does have athletic teams. Just ask<br />\nany one of the present seniors who participated in that last<br />\nraemorable rally about it and I'll bet they can tell you all the<br />\n,etails.

From<br />\nthe looks of the lacrosse contests on the slate Fred Smith should,<br />\nwith any luck at all, come up with a winning season.

At the basketball<br />\ngame versus our areh-rival from up Charles Street, Loyola, a week<br />\nago last Wednesday night, the Homewood Gymnasium was booming forth with the greatest amount of spirit shown by a partisan<br />\nsrowd in many-a-moon on this campus. In return for this<br />\nrevitalized spirit put forth by the Jay hoop fans, Coach Bilgrav's<br />\nquintet put on their most magnificent home performance of the<br />\nseason as they turned back the Greyhounds for the first time<br />\nsince the 1951 season.<br />\nGRAPPLERS FULL OF SPIRIT<br /><br />\nIt was a great feeling for this old senior to be a part of that<br />\nsupporting body, and brought back memories of the good-old<br />\n.days (freshman year).
