Agnew bade the American people farewell in a brief<br />\ntelevision address last night, and it can only be said that they<br />\nwill be better off for his departure. During his brief address, he<br />\nappeared to place part of the blame for his misfortune on the<br />\npress, the prosecutors, the system, instead of all on himself,<br />\nwhere it belonged. It was one of the most cynical public<br />\nspeeches ever made by a political figure and it was also one of<br />\nthe most pathetic.<br />\nFor here was a man who had risen from obscure Baltimore<br />\ncounty zoning politics to a seat on the dais of the United State<br />\nSenate, a chair in the National Security Council, and the second<br />\nhighest office the nation can bestow. Allegedly through most of<br />\nhis quick rise, he was demanding\u2014and getting\u2014substantial<br />\npayments, both in money and in kind, from assorted associates,<br />\ncontractors and favor seekers. He had taken oaths to support<br />\nthe laws and the Constitution and he had on occasion lambasted<br />\nhis critics, as an ',effete corps of impudent snobs who<br />\ncharacterize themselves as intellectuals.\" or on anoter occasion<br />\nas \"nattering nabobs of negativism.\"<br />\nA llarge portion of the American people responded to him,<br />\nbelieved him and supported him, and yet he was apparently<br />\ncontent every moment to accept envelopes full of cash from<br />\nmessengers, allegedly including one who made his drop in the<br />\nVice-President's office next door to the White House. Every<br />\ndollar he collected for favors granted or favors promised<br />\neventually had to be repaid from somewhere, and it usually was<br />\nfrom the pockets of the citizens whose laws he was sworn to<br />\nuphold.<br />\nHe talked tough and he often expressed contempt for those<br />\nAmericans who did not share his beliefs, but in the end he<br />\nshowed he felt only contempt for all of them.<br />\n<br />\nAgnew<br />\n<br />\nlxxriii. no.,121tuesday, qctqber 16, 1973Ibaltimore, marylanc1178th year<br />\n<br />\nNEWS LETTER<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br />\n<br />\nftraw<br />\n<br />\nArabella Lamour<br />\n<br />\nThis woman's name is Arabella<br />\nLamour.

It was in<br />\nthis small, but tightly knit club<br />\nthat Arabella Lamour first found<br />\nTrue Love.

And wouldn't it<br />\nbe their luck to get caught without<br />\n<br />\nmemorable, however, for as she<br />\nstepped down off the bus, Arabella<br />\ntripped on an avocado rind and<br />\nbroke both of her legs.

Israel has only<br />\nwon wars, yet it has never won<br />\npeace. Arab and Israeli have both<br />\ngained nothing.

I<br />\nonly know what I read in the<br />\npapers. But aside from the obvious<br />\ndisadvantages that this armed<br />\nconflict presents to the people<br />\ndoing the fighting, the<br />\nconsequences that this war will<br />\nhave upon the world scene appear<br />\ngrave.<br />\nThe war shortens hopes that an<br />\namicable solution to both sides of<br />\nthe problem is within sight. It<br />\nplaces the U.S., which depends<br />\nupon a good deal of Arab oil, in a<br />\nsituation that the country has long<br />\nfeared and wished to avoid at all<br />\ncosts, and the ever-present threat<br />\nof escalation seriously weakens the<br />\nfoundations of detente, if indeed<br />\nthose foundations ever existed in<br />\nthe first place.<br />\nSo I can understand why<br />\nconcern for developments runs so<br />\nhigh. What I can't understand are<br />\nsome attitudes, particularly<br />\nattitudes expressed by some Jewish<br />\nstudents on campus towards the<br />\n,<br />\nwar.<br />\nI fail to see how reports of<br />\ndestruction of Syrian and Egyptian<br />\ntroops can evoke shouts of praise<br />\nand happiness; and I can't<br />\nunderstand how the losses of men<br />\nand material and the destruction of<br />\nfamilies and homes can be reduced<br />\nto statistics and bantered around<br />\nlike the latest world series score.<br />\nAnd, granted the fact that it is not<br />\nevery day that Walter Crenkite<br />\ntakes pointer and chalk in hand to<br />\nspend twenty minutes on the<br />\nconflict as if it were some sort of<br />\ncircus side-show, yet, where is the<br />\ngain; who wins?<br />\nWhere, through the miles of<br />\nburning wreckage, is the road to<br />\nlasting peace for Arab and Jew? Has<br />\nten years of protracted conflict in<br />\na fruitless and wasteful war in<br />\nSoutheast Asia taught us no lesson,<br />\nthat people take up collections for<br />\nan 'Aid to Israel' fund \u2022 for<br />\nprolonging the struggle.<br />\nThe fact that Israel was the<br />\nvictim of an act of overt aggression<br />\nmakes no difference when no-one<br />\nwins. This war will solve nothing,<br />\nwill heal no-one, it will only create<br />\nnew problems and prolong old<br />\nones.

The<br />\nGarnets' tying goal came during<br />\none of the lazy minutes as have<br />\nmost of the goals scored against<br />\nthe Jays in previous games.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' worst enemy,<br />\nthe fast-break, came to work<br />\nagainst Hopkins again as the<br />\nGarnets scored their only goal tc<br />\nknot the score. Throughout the<br />\nremainder of the first half and all<br />\nthrough the second half, the only<br />\nGarnet scoring threats came<br />\nduring these periods when the<br />\nJays tend to \"slack-off\" and<br />\nlessen the pressure on their<br />\nopponents.<br />\nWhat the team needs is eleven<br />\n90-minutes players; eighty-nine<br />\nminutes is not enough.

Having lost<br />\nseventeen players for academic<br />\nreasons, the Cougars could field<br />\nonly 28 gridmen and were forced<br />\nto start a lineman at the<br />\nquarterback position. With no<br />\nrunning game to speak of and<br />\nlimited execution skills, they<br />\nresorted to frequently marginal<br />\ntactics, which contributed to the<br />\npenalty production. Three<br />\nhundred yards were marked off<br />\nagainst both teams with Teachers<br />\nsuffering the majority of the<br />\nassessments.<br />\nFollowing the Cougar<br />\ntouchdown that opened the third<br />\nperiod, Hopkins never once let<br />\nTeachers encroach on Blue Jay<br />\nterritory again. Thomas<br />\nculminated a seven play drive on<br />\nthe next kickoff with a 25 yard<br />\npass to Jones, who tightroped the<br />\nlast three yards on the sideline<br />\nfor the third Hopkins<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nBefore the Blue Jays had<br />\nfinished with their opponents,<br />\nNolan claimed his second score,<br />\nJack Coulter brought home a 56<br />\n<br />\nHopkins, harriers<br />\nhit Haverford hard<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins cross country<br />\nteam furthered their hopes for a<br />\nwinning season Saturday by<br />\nearning a split with perennial<br />\npowers Haverford and Drexel.<br />\nThe Blue Jays manhandled<br />\nHaverford, 23-35, while falling to<br />\nDrexel, 20-40, on the grueling 5<br />\nmile course at Belmont Plateau in<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nThe split is especially<br />\nsatisfying since no one, including<br />\nCoach Don Masken, can recall<br />\ndefeating Haverford or averting a<br />\nshutout by Drexel, even on the<br />\nhome course.<br />\nDrexel again proved why they<br />\nare a university division team by<br />\ntaking first place and three of the<br />\nnext five slots. Haverford's Blair<br />\nHynes took second,just ahead of<br />\nBlue Jay leader Jeff Greve.

With three<br />\ninterceptions and two lost<br />\nfumbles, the Blue Jays have room<br />\nfor improvement in keeping<br />\npossession of the ball.

Israel has only<br />\nwon wars, yet it has never won<br />\npeace. Arab and Israeli have both<br />\ngained nothing. And that gain will<br />\ncome only when battles take place<br />\nacross a bargaining table. That<br />\nbattle may take the greatest<br />\ncourage that either side has yet<br />\nproduced.<br />\nLarry Haislip<br /><br />\nconcerning reactions I have<br />\nobserved among students here on<br />\nthe Hopkins campus.<br />\nI am not nor do I profess to be<br />\nan expert on Foreign Affairs. I<br />\nonly know what I read in the<br />\npapers. But aside from the obvious<br />\ndisadvantages that this armed<br />\nconflict presents to the people<br />\ndoing the fighting, the<br />\nconsequences that this war will<br />\nhave upon the world scene appear<br />\ngrave.<br />\nThe war shortens hopes that an<br />\namicable solution to both sides of<br />\nthe problem is within sight. It<br />\nplaces the U.S., which depends<br />\nupon a good deal of Arab oil, in a<br />\nsituation that the country has long<br />\nfeared and wished to avoid at all<br />\ncosts, and the ever-present threat<br />\nof escalation seriously weakens the<br />\nfoundations of detente, if indeed<br />\nthose foundations ever existed in<br />\nthe first place.<br />\nSo I can understand why<br />\nconcern for developments runs so<br />\nhigh. What I can't understand are<br />\nsome attitudes, particularly<br />\nattitudes expressed by some Jewish<br />\nstudents on campus towards the<br />\n,<br />\nwar.<br />\nI fail to see how reports of<br />\ndestruction of Syrian and Egyptian<br />\ntroops can evoke shouts of praise<br />\nand happiness; and I can't<br />\nunderstand how the losses of men<br />\nand material and the destruction of<br />\nfamilies and homes can be reduced<br />\nto statistics and bantered around<br />\nlike the latest world series score.<br />\nAnd, granted the fact that it is not<br />\nevery day that Walter Crenkite<br />\ntakes pointer and chalk in hand to<br />\nspend twenty minutes on the<br />\nconflict as if it were some sort of<br />\ncircus side-show, yet, where is the<br />\ngain; who wins?<br />\nWhere, through the miles of<br />\nburning wreckage, is the road to<br />\nlasting peace for Arab and Jew? Has<br />\nten years of protracted conflict in<br />\na fruitless and wasteful war in<br />\nSoutheast Asia taught us no lesson,<br />\nthat people take up collections for<br />\nan 'Aid to Israel' fund \u2022 for<br />\nprolonging the struggle.<br />\nThe fact that Israel was the<br />\nvictim of an act of overt aggression<br />\nmakes no difference when no-one<br />\nwins. This war will solve nothing,<br />\nwill heal no-one, it will only create<br />\nnew problems and prolong old<br />\nones.

A<br />\ntwo point conversion narrowed<br />\nthe gap to 16-14, but the tally<br />\nproved to be the last gasp for the<br />\nmistake prone Teachers team.<br />\nThe Blue Jays then settled down<br />\nto their own brand of football<br />\nand thoroughly dominated the<br />\nCougars for the rest of the<br />\nafternoon.<br />\nHopkins scored the first time<br />\nthey got the ball in the opening<br />\nminutes of the game, when Jack<br />\nThomas hit Bill Nolan on a 21<br />\nyard pass in the endzone. It was<br /><br />\nNEws-imet<br /><br />\nthe first of ten receptions for the<br />\nsenior wide receiver, tying a<br />\nHopkins school record. Nolan's<br />\ncatches were good for 98 yards<br />\nand a second touchdown before<br />\nthe contest expired.<br />\nUnable to move the ball in the<br />\nnext Blue Jay possession,<br />\nThomas uncorked a sixty yard<br />\npunt that Jack Coulter downed<br />\non the Cougar four. The defense<br />\npushed Teachers back to the goal<br />\nline and their snap to the punter<br />\nsailed high over his head at the<br />\nbaseline to give Hopkins a safety.<br />\nThe Blue Jays took the ensuing<br />\nkick and 'registered another seven<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nRooters tie Garnets, 1-1<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nsoccer team travelled to<br />\nSwarthmore, Pennsylvania last<br />\nSaturday to play the Garnets of<br />\nSwarthmore College. The game<br />\nwas of great importance to both<br />\nteams for it meant staying in<br />\ncontention for the Middle<br />\nAtlantic Conference title. The<br />\nBlue Jays, brandishing a 2-0<br />\nconference record, needed the<br />\nwin to keep them on top of the<br />\nrace, whereas the Garnets, with<br />\nnot as impressive a league record,<br />\nneeded a win to stay in the<br />\nrunning:<br />\nAfter the 90-minute game had<br />\nfinished, and because of a newly<br />\ninstalled NCAA rule regarding<br />\novertimes, the Blue Jays and the<br />\nGarnets had to return to their<br />\nlocker rooms with a mark in the<br />\n\"tie\" column for the final score<br />\nwas 1-1. The NCAA just<br />\ninstituted a rule which allowed a<br /><br />\ngame to end in a tie without<br />\ngoing into the two five-minute<br />\novertime periods, as in the past.<br />\nTwo years ago, the Hopkins<br />\nsquad saw the Garnets take<br />\nadvantage of the extra 10<br />\nminutes and defeat the Jays by<br />\none goal.<br />\nHigh Winds<br />\nThe Jays played an<br />\noutstanding game overall against<br />\nthe Garnets Saturday, despite the<br />\nhigh winds and very poor<br />\nreferees.<br />\nTo the surprise of a very large<br />\nGarnet Homecoming crowd, the<br />\nBlue Jays dominated a majority<br />\nof the game as the Garnets<br />\noccasionally broke through the<br />\nHopkins defense and worked the<br />\nball on their offensive side of the<br />\nfield.<br />\nFreshman Tommy Myrick put<br />\nthe Jays on the scoreboard when<br />\nhe received a long-crossed- ball<br />\nfrom freshman Gary Ignatowski.<br /><br />\nBIA cycle event has<br />\naction and sidelights<br />\nIndependent cyclist Ec<br />\nLongaba ugh reeled off the 6.'<br />\nmiles of the BIA bike race ir<br />\n17:10 to take the individual<br />\nhonors, while DU and Willard<br />\noutclassed their respective rivals<br />\nin the, team competitions<br />\nSaturday morning.<br />\nJim Spiring and John Veil<br />\nfinished third and ninth to give<br />\nDUE the fraternity crown,<br />\ntopping runnersup TEP and<br />\nATO.

They can play great<br />\nsoccer for 88 minutes during a<br />\ngame with those two lazy<br />\nminutes hidden somewhere<br />\nwithin the course of play. The<br />\nGarnets' tying goal came during<br />\none of the lazy minutes as have<br />\nmost of the goals scored against<br />\nthe Jays in previous games.<br />\nThe Blue Jays' worst enemy,<br />\nthe fast-break, came to work<br />\nagainst Hopkins again as the<br />\nGarnets scored their only goal tc<br />\nknot the score. Throughout the<br />\nremainder of the first half and all<br />\nthrough the second half, the only<br />\nGarnet scoring threats came<br />\nduring these periods when the<br />\nJays tend to \"slack-off\" and<br />\nlessen the pressure on their<br />\nopponents.<br />\nWhat the team needs is eleven<br />\n90-minutes players; eighty-nine<br />\nminutes is not enough. The Jays<br />\nwill get their next chance to slip<br />\nover the .500 mark this Thursday<br />\nat 3:00 p.m. at the Homewood<br />\nsoccer field as they play host to<br />\nGettysburg College.<br /><br />\npoints when Billy Jones barged<br />\nover from the one.<br />\nIn the second quarter, the Blue<br />\nJays succumbed to the bizarre<br />\nsloppiness that permeated the<br />\nTeachers squad. Having lost<br />\nseventeen players for academic<br />\nreasons, the Cougars could field<br />\nonly 28 gridmen and were forced<br />\nto start a lineman at the<br />\nquarterback position. With no<br />\nrunning game to speak of and<br />\nlimited execution skills, they<br />\nresorted to frequently marginal<br />\ntactics, which contributed to the<br />\npenalty production. Three<br />\nhundred yards were marked off<br />\nagainst both teams with Teachers<br />\nsuffering the majority of the<br />\nassessments.<br />\nFollowing the Cougar<br />\ntouchdown that opened the third<br />\nperiod, Hopkins never once let<br />\nTeachers encroach on Blue Jay<br />\nterritory again. Thomas<br />\nculminated a seven play drive on<br />\nthe next kickoff with a 25 yard<br />\npass to Jones, who tightroped the<br />\nlast three yards on the sideline<br />\nfor the third Hopkins<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nBefore the Blue Jays had<br />\nfinished with their opponents,<br />\nNolan claimed his second score,<br />\nJack Coulter brought home a 56<br /><br />\nHopkins, harriers<br />\nhit Haverford hard<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins cross country<br />\nteam furthered their hopes for a<br />\nwinning season Saturday by<br />\nearning a split with perennial<br />\npowers Haverford and Drexel.<br />\nThe Blue Jays manhandled<br />\nHaverford, 23-35, while falling to<br />\nDrexel, 20-40, on the grueling 5<br />\nmile course at Belmont Plateau in<br />\nPhiladelphia.<br />\nThe split is especially<br />\nsatisfying since no one, including<br />\nCoach Don Masken, can recall<br />\ndefeating Haverford or averting a<br />\nshutout by Drexel, even on the<br />\nhome course.<br />\nDrexel again proved why they<br />\nare a university division team by<br />\ntaking first place and three of the<br />\nnext five slots. Haverford's Blair<br />\nHynes took second,just ahead of<br />\nBlue Jay leader Jeff Greve. Greve<br />\neasily had his best time on the<br />\nhilly course, which he had run<br />\ntwice before in MAC<br />\nchampionship meets.<br />\nThe real strength of the team<br /><br />\nsports briefs<br />\nFall Lacrosse<br />\nTwo scrimmages are on top<br />\nthis week as the fall lacrosse<br />\ncampaign continues.

With three<br />\ninterceptions and two lost<br />\nfumbles, the Blue Jays have room<br />\nfor improvement in keeping<br />\npossession of the ball. However,<br />\nthe kciking game is returning to<br />\nthe form that gave Hopkins the<br />\nleague lead in punting last year.<br />\nTackles<br />\nDefensively, Jack Coulter<br />\nanchored the Blue Jays with<br />\nseven unassisted tackles and two<br />\nblocked passes, in addition to his<br />\npunt return.

The rest of the<br />\nHopkins top five, John Tetzlaff,<br />\nJon Higdon, and Freshman<br />\nRandy Safier defeated the 3rd<br />\nHaverford man, assuring victory<br />\nfor the team.<br />\nThe depth of the team was<br />\nagain evident as 6th man Bob<br />\nWarren defeated the 4th<br />\nHaverford runner, and Chuck<br />\nMick, having easily his best race<br />\nof the season, defeated their 5th<br />\nman.<br />\n\"After today's race, I would<br />\nhave to say I'm optimistic,\" said<br />\nCoach Don Masken of the<br />\nchances of having his first<br />\nwinning season as cross- country<br />\ncoach. \"With the depth this team<br />\nhas, we can absorb someone<br />\nhaving a bad day,\" he said,<br />\npointing to the races of Mick and<br />\nWarren, who ran despite a pulled<br />\nleg muscle.<br />\nThis afternoon the harriers<br />\ntravel to Catonsville for a<br />\ntri-meet with Salisbury and<br />\nUMBC.
