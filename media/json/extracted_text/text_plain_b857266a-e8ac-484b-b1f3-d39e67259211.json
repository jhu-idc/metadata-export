The American people have never been given<br />\nthe chance in an election to express approval or disapproval of<br />\nBaruch\u2014indeed for the most part<br />\nthey haven't even had the chance<br />\nto be informed on what he is<br />\nor does. (During the First World<br />\nWar, he was made head of the<br />\nWar Industries Board, and his<br />\npower may be judged by his<br />\nsworn statement to Congress<br />\nthat 'President Wilson gave me a<br />\nletter authorizing me to take<br />\nover any industry or plant.' Since<br />\nWilson's administration, Baruch<br />\nhas preferred to sit back and tell<br />\nPresidents what to do, rather<br />\nthan take any more official posts<br />\nhimself where he might be held<br />\nresponsible for what happens).<br />\nThe bracketed portions are<br />\nwhat was cut by the copy desk.<br />\nThe third paragraph that was<br />\ncut originally read: \"When<br />\nmoney is abundant, prices are<br />\nhigh. Say at this time a bank<br />\n<br />\nloans a farmer a sum of money<br />\ntwo hundred<br />\nequivalent to<br />\nbushels of wheat. Then banks<br />\ncall in enough of their loans to<br />\nmoney scarce. (With<br />\nmake<br />\nmoney scarce now prices go<br />\ndawn. When the loan to the<br />\nfarmer falls due, he will still<br />\nhave to pay back the same sum<br />\nof money, but because of the<br />\nlow prices he may have to sell<br />\none thousand bushels of wheat<br />\nto get the money. Furthermore,<br />\nsince money is scarce, the farmer<br />\nmay not be able to sell any of<br />\nhis wheat at all. And unless he<br />\ncan sell one thousand bushels,<br />\nhe loses his farm, or whatever<br />\nthe security Mr the loan was.)<br />\nThus more and more of the property of the nation comes into<br />\nbank hands.\" Again, brackets indicate what was cut.<br />\nIn answer to what many<br />\npeople seem to think is an objection to the facts about the<br />\nFederal Reserve, one might observe that although it is true<br />\nthat many small country banks<br />\n<br />\nwent permanently broke in the<br />\nDepression, the Federal Reserve<br />\nmade tremendous profits on it.<br />\nMen like Baruch, Warburg, Lehman and Mellon came out of the<br />\nDepression richer than ever.<br />\nHaving now made my case<br />\nagainst the existing money system fairly complete, I remain<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nLee Lady<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy College<br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\nDegrees awarded by the McCoy College do not on the face<br />\nof them indicate specifically that<br />\nthey are for a night school.

However, this distinction is<br />\nrather subtle and assumes a<br />\nknowledge of the difference on<br />\nthe part of employers hiring<br />\nHopkins graduates.

The American people have never been given<br />\nthe chance in an election to express approval or disapproval of<br />\nBaruch\u2014indeed for the most part<br />\nthey haven't even had the chance<br />\nto be informed on what he is<br />\nor does. (During the First World<br />\nWar, he was made head of the<br />\nWar Industries Board, and his<br />\npower may be judged by his<br />\nsworn statement to Congress<br />\nthat 'President Wilson gave me a<br />\nletter authorizing me to take<br />\nover any industry or plant.' Since<br />\nWilson's administration, Baruch<br />\nhas preferred to sit back and tell<br />\nPresidents what to do, rather<br />\nthan take any more official posts<br />\nhimself where he might be held<br />\nresponsible for what happens).<br />\nThe bracketed portions are<br />\nwhat was cut by the copy desk.<br />\nThe third paragraph that was<br />\ncut originally read: \"When<br />\nmoney is abundant, prices are<br />\nhigh. Say at this time a bank<br /><br />\nloans a farmer a sum of money<br />\ntwo hundred<br />\nequivalent to<br />\nbushels of wheat. Then banks<br />\ncall in enough of their loans to<br />\nmoney scarce. (With<br />\nmake<br />\nmoney scarce now prices go<br />\ndawn. When the loan to the<br />\nfarmer falls due, he will still<br />\nhave to pay back the same sum<br />\nof money, but because of the<br />\nlow prices he may have to sell<br />\none thousand bushels of wheat<br />\nto get the money. Furthermore,<br />\nsince money is scarce, the farmer<br />\nmay not be able to sell any of<br />\nhis wheat at all. And unless he<br />\ncan sell one thousand bushels,<br />\nhe loses his farm, or whatever<br />\nthe security Mr the loan was.)<br />\nThus more and more of the property of the nation comes into<br />\nbank hands.\" Again, brackets indicate what was cut.<br />\nIn answer to what many<br />\npeople seem to think is an objection to the facts about the<br />\nFederal Reserve, one might observe that although it is true<br />\nthat many small country banks<br /><br />\nwent permanently broke in the<br />\nDepression, the Federal Reserve<br />\nmade tremendous profits on it.<br />\nMen like Baruch, Warburg, Lehman and Mellon came out of the<br />\nDepression richer than ever.<br />\nHaving now made my case<br />\nagainst the existing money system fairly complete, I remain<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nLee Lady<br /><br />\nMcCoy College<br />\nDear Sirs:<br />\nDegrees awarded by the McCoy College do not on the face<br />\nof them indicate specifically that<br />\nthey are for a night school.
