This<br />\nmove would, in effect, reduce the<br />\npower of the position in the administrative structure.<br />\nThe main concern for students,<br />\nnoted FitzGerald, is whether or<br />\nnot the person replacing Welch<br />\nwill have the power to be as effective as Welch has been. \"Will<br />\nthe new system be beneficial or<br />\nharmful to students?\" asked<br />\n<br />\nFitzGerald.<br />\nOf equal importance is the<br />\nbudgetary situation for the new<br />\nposition. After meeting with<br />\nArmstrong and VandeLinde, FitzGerald noted some confusion<br />\nregarding exactly to whom Welch<br />\nsubmitted his budget proposal.<br />\nThis confusion, he said, is important because an autonomous<br />\nbudget for the position would<br />\ngive Welch's replacement some<br />\nsense of authority and responsibility even if he would need to<br />\nreport directly to the academic<br />\ndeans on other issues.<br />\nFitzGerald commented, \"If<br />\n<br />\nGiangiulio wins SC presidency;<br />\nEight left in Young Trustee bid<br />\nELECTIONS, from 1<br />\ndirector of the Hopkins Organization for Programming.

Howard<br />\nBaetjer, a doctoral student at George<br />\nMason University, extolled, \"The New<br />\nLiberal Case for Laissez-Faire\" at a lecture Wednesday in Roland Hall.<br />\nAs a member of The Institute for<br />\nHumane Studies, a libertarian think-tank<br />\nat George Mason, Baefjer presented the<br />\nphilosophical reasons for a completely free<br />\nmarket society in 1988.<br />\nBaetjer's argument centers around the<br />\nindividual's rights as opposed to government's authority. \"If rights precede<br />\ngovernment,\" he said, \"and if governments are created by people, than logically government cannot have any rightful<br />\nauthority beyond that what the individuals<br />\nthat set it up had to give it.\"<br />\nFundamental among those rights is the<br />\nright to property. Baetjer contended that<br />\ngovernment should not interfere with the<br />\nindividual's economic freedoms. \"I doubt<br />\nthat individuals have a right to use force<br />\naggressively to get what they want from<br />\nsomebody else,\" he said. \"We can't turn<br />\nover to government that sort of authority.<br />\nJust as it is wrong for you to steal a handbag or a car,\" he continued, \"it's wrong<br />\nfor the government to take the handbag or<br />\nthe car, even if it's to distribute the goods<br />\nto the needy or to use the car to transport<br />\n<br />\nthe handicapped, Government does not<br />\nhave the right to take property, even if it's<br />\nto do good deeds with.\"<br />\nBaetjer envisioned a society \"where<br />\nthere is a virtual separation between<br />\neconomy and state.\" He claimed that his<br />\ntheory is not pro-business but pro-market.<br />\nIn this society, government's role would<br />\nbe reduced to \"keeping the peace and enforcing contracts.<br />\n\"If things are left alone, there will<br />\nemerge a wonderfully orderly society,\"<br />\nhe remarked. \"Government's attempt to<br />\nimpose a direction on society's economic<br />\ndevelopment injects chaos into order.\"<br />\nAccording to Baetjer, special interest<br />\ngroups corrupt government, and regulations result, benefitting a minority while<br />\nhurting the rest. While conceding that a<br />\nfree market society [in the libertarian<br />\nsense] might not be perfect, Baetjer called it the best possible solution.<br />\nRacism, environmental destruction, and<br />\nbelligerence, he said, are institutionalized<br />\ninto law, by special interest groups. The<br />\nfree market, instead would penalize those<br />\nwho perpetrated such policies by making<br />\nthese policies uneconomical to carry out.<br />\nBaetjer cited South Africa as a case in<br />\npoint. \"The white supremacist unions advocate a minimum wage to disadvantage<br />\nblacks,\" he said, explaining that the unions<br />\nseek to make the cost of hiring blacks as<br />\ncheap labor prohibitive to employers. A<br />\nfree market allows blacks to have jobs, he<br />\ncontended.<br />\n\"Currently, if they hire one white person instead of five blacks, the employer<br />\npays three dollars an hour to indulge his<br />\nbigotry.\" said Baetjer. \"The free market<br />\nallows people to bid, 'O.K., you s.o.b.,<br />\nI'll do it for less.\"<br />\n<br />\nBernie Liu<br />\n<br />\nHoward Baetjer, a doctoral student at George Mason University, who spoke<br />\nWednesday on the values of a free market society in a lecture entitled The New<br />\nLiberal Case for Laissez-Faire.<br />\nBaetjer added that normal market<br />\npressures made uneconomical the prospect<br />\nof train and bus companies in South Africa<br />\nsegregating buses and trains. Jim Crow<br />\nlaws reversed that idea.<br />\nOn the environment, Baetjer referred to<br />\nthe logging of the Tongass National Forest<br />\nin Alaska. Tax payers subsidize the logging, he noted. Without such subsidies, \"it<br />\nwould cost too much to build roads.\"<br />\nBaetjer would prefer to see the Tongass<br />\nForest in private ownership. \"The logging wouldn't have been done, because it's<br />\nuneconomical,\" he said.<br />\n\"There are strong incentives for preservation in private ownership,\" he continued. \"If you own the buffalo or whales,<br />\nand you can sell them later, you will be<br />\ninterested in preserving them.\"<br />\nThe risk of war would be reduced in a<br />\nworldwide free market society, according<br />\nto Baetjer. \"If you're interdependent,\" he<br />\n<br />\nsaid, \"you don't bomb your trading partners, just as you don't throw Molotov<br />\ncocktails into the grocery store where you<br />\nFt your nachos.\"<br />\nBaetjer claims that the government provides \"perverse\" incentives to the poor to<br />\nstay below the poverty level to qualify for<br />\nfood stamps, housing, and Medicare. \"It<br />\nreally doesn't matter that they have no<br />\nskills or jobs,\" said Baetjer, \"because<br />\nthey're on social welfare.\"<br />\nWhile most of the \"disadvantaged\"<br />\nrealize that the allure of living on the<br />\nfederal dole is false, Baetjer alleged that.<br />\n\"there is a detrimental psychological effect of social welfare on ten to twelve percent of the population.\"<br />\nBaetjer favors the abolishment of Social<br />\nSecurity, also advocating \"no bailouts of<br />\n' large corporations, no small business<br />\nloans, no grants to college students.\"<br />\n<br />\nLL PLLL<br />\nToday<br />\nin the<br />\n<br />\n4,<br />\n<br />\nGlass Pavilion<br />\n<br />\n*FREE MUNCHIES<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n4-7:30 p.m.<br />\nMUSIC BY JAZZ BAND<br />\n<br />\nSoda<br />\nBeer<br />\neer<br />\n1<br />\nAdmission<br />\nis free and open<br />\nto the<br />\nh entire Hopkins community<br />\nSponsored by the Sophomore Class<br />\n<br />\n47<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n\f6/MARCH 11','1988<br />\n<br />\nSexual harrassment lecture held<br />\nLeys, Van Utt define Hopkins' role<br />\nin providing support for victims<br />\nby Jonathan Engler<br />\nThe Hopkins Sexual Harassment Advisors' Network held a<br />\nsymposium last Thursday to address the issue of sexual harassment at Hopkins, as well as to<br />\ngive advice as to what to do if one<br />\nhas been harassed.<br />\nCreated to complement the<br />\n1980 Hopkins guidelines relating<br />\nto sexual harassment in the<br />\nUniversity workplace and<br />\nclassroom, the network consists<br />\nof thirteen members from<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nRuth Leys, a network member<br />\nand executive director of the<br />\nMind/Brain Institute, said, \"The<br />\nidea is to make sure there are<br />\nmany access points [for complainants], because people who<br />\nhave been harassed are often<br />\nreluctant to come forward.\" An<br />\nalternative to filing a formal<br />\nclaim, contact with the network<br />\nis confidential unless the complainant directs otherwise.<br />\nHopkins' and the network's<br />\ndefinition of sexual harassment is,<br />\n\"the use of a person's acceptance<br />\nof requests for sexual favors, or<br />\na refusal to accept such requests,<br />\nas a basis for making employment<br />\nor academic decisions about that<br />\nperson,\"or, \"the creation of a<br />\nhostile or intimidating environment because of unwanted comments<br />\nor actions of sexual<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nabuse.\"<br />\nWhile many who are being<br />\nharassed believe that they must<br />\nput up with the abuse as par for<br />\nthe course, Leys stressed that the<br />\nopposite is true. \"The University has a legal<br />\nobligation to worry about sexual<br />\nharassment,\"she said, and has<br />\nmany, many approaches to address an incident. Sexual harassment can be as obvious as unwanted physical contact or as subtle as offhand remarks that make<br />\na victim feel uncomfortable and<br />\nnot respected as a professional.<br />\nThe latter situation could be so<br />\nsubtle that harassers and victims<br />\nwould not recognize it as abuse.<br />\nNetwork member and University Chaplain _Gretchen Van Utt<br />\n<br />\nsaid, \"Sometimes it [the harassment] isn't intentional. . .<br />\nsometimes people just need it<br />\npointed out.\"<br />\nAs a result of this problem,<br />\nwhen a student or employee contacts the network, he does not<br />\nnecessarily have to file a formal<br />\ncomplaint, nor must he release his<br />\nname.<br />\nWhile Leys emphasized that<br />\n\"one of the responsibilities of the<br />\nnetwork is to get the complaint to<br />\nthe supervisors. \"If an individual<br />\ndoes not want to get involved, the<br />\ncomplaint can be aired in broad<br />\ngeneralities at a department'<br />\nNews-Letter file<br />\nmeeting.

Bennett has been making headlines<br />\nwith the charge that American colleges are irresponsibly increasing<br />\ntuition without first making their operations more efficient. He is<br />\ngrousing about the increases because the Education Department pays<br />\na good percentage of the college costs of needy students, and when<br />\ncolleges raise tuition to get more money, his department must either<br />\ncontribute more or help fewer students.<br />\nCollege presidents have responded with salvos about inadequate<br />\nfaculty salaries, increasing maintenance costs, and the care with which<br />\ntheir frugal budgets are planned. But as far as I know, none of them<br />\nhas pointed out what a bargain a college education is today.<br />\nConsider the arithmetic of what it costs a college to educate a student for a year. While there is a wide variation among institutions,<br />\non average it requires about $12,000 per student to provide all the<br />\nservices at a residential college. The money to pay for those services<br />\ncomes from various sources, depending on whether the college is<br />\nprivate or public and on family circumstances. In general, a typical<br />\nstudent's family actually pays less than half the cost of his or her higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nTo pursue the arithmetic further, since students are in college about<br />\n200 days a year, the cost of a day of education works out to an average<br />\nof $60. I can't help wondering if the Secretary has ever taken a careful<br />\nlook at what students get for that money (much of which comes from<br />\nthe colleges themselves and outside agencies). Here is an incomplete<br />\nlist:<br />\n*A room and bath (often semi-private) and three meals, plus heat and<br />\nelectricity.<br />\n*A variety of free or low-cost cultural, social, and sports events, as<br />\nwell as extra-curricular activities ranging from dramatics to the campus newspaper.<br />\n\u2022Special student facilities for socializing and meeting members of the<br />\nopposite sex.<br />\n*What amounts to a club membership for recreation, including swimming, tennis, golf (except in cities), and other sports.<br />\n'Team-sports programs, with special arrangements for skilled athletes,<br />\nwho in effect are paid to attend college.<br />\n*A health department offering care for both physical and psychological<br />\nills.<br />\n*Counseling services to assist with education, vocational, and personal decisions, and a placement office to turn to for help finding<br />\njobs during the academic year, in the summer, and after graduation.<br />\n\"Study-abroad programs, with most of the cost covered by the amount<br />\nthe student and other sources pay for the year on campus.<br />\n'Access to special educational facilities and opportunities such as<br />\nlibraries, laboratories, museums, field trips, and guest lectures, as<br />\nwell as special tutoring when required.<br />\n<br />\nSee CHRONICLE, 13<br />\n<br />\n\f10/MARCH<br />\n<br />\n; t988<br />\n<br />\nCy Anderson<br />\n<br />\nDiscerning the real solvable issues for SC<br />\nYou may have noticed posters<br />\naround campus early this week<br />\nfeaturing a candidate with an eyecatching physique.

The<br />\n\"throatism\" will not go away until you give premeds guaranteed<br />\nadmissions into med school. Part<br />\nof this is caused by the course<br />\nworkload. Last year a magazine<br />\nrated Hopkins as having the<br />\nhighest workload anywhere. The<br />\nonly thing I can suggest is to take<br />\nengineering courses where it<br />\ndoesn't matter how much you<br />\nstudy, only how well you understand it, or creative courses like<br />\nwriting sems where quantity does<br />\nnot matter.<br />\nAs for \"sexual intolerance\" it<br />\nis my opinion that someone is using the News-Letter as a platform<br />\nto shovel this B.S.

The alleged essence of<br />\nLindsay's letter is her concern<br />\nthat a rumored revision in the<br />\nLetters Policy, limiting letters to<br />\nthe editor to those which pertain<br />\nto campus-related issues, will inhibit \"greater understanding of<br />\nworld events among Hopkins<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nFirst, writing a letter based on<br />\na rumor is poor scholarship and<br />\nreveals that Lindsay is not truly<br />\nconcerned enough over the<br />\nrumored change in policy to<br />\nverify whether or not the rumor<br />\nis substantive. If Lindsay were as<br />\nconcerned as she would like us to<br />\nbelieve, she could have easily inquired of the editors themselves<br />\nif the rumored policy revision<br />\nwere true. If the real motivation<br />\n<br />\nbehind Lindsay's letter was not to<br />\nprotest a revised Letter Policy,<br />\nwhat was her hidden agenda?<br />\nPerhaps a politicized account of<br />\nrecent South African events?<br />\nWhatever Lindsay's motivation,<br />\nher letter strikes me as disingenuous in its appeal to maintain the present Letters Policy.<br />\nNot to denigrate the content of<br />\nthe News-Letter or affront its<br />\nstaff, but the more egregious of<br />\nLindsay's transgressions is her<br />\nassertion that the school paper<br />\nprovides Hopkins students with a<br />\nsignificant part of their exposure<br />\nto world events. This contention<br />\nis asinine. Not only is a weekly<br />\nstudent publication which<br />\nprimarily deals with campusrelated issues a poor medium<br />\nthrough which to keep abreast of<br />\nglobal events, but those students<br />\nwho do rely on the News-Letter<br />\nfor such purposes are in sorry<br />\nshape indeed.

Because individual<br />\nitems are charged and not whole<br />\nmeals, prices would become<br />\ncompetitive as well as quality.<br />\nWhat about the bill? Hopkins<br />\nwould send recommended<br />\namounts based on price averages<br />\nto parents. Parents would be free<br />\nto place more or less than that<br />\namount on the charge card, and<br />\nif the student runs out of money<br />\nduring the semester, he or she is<br />\nfaced with either begging mommy and daddy to add to the card,<br />\nor dealing with spot prices in<br />\ncold, hard cash. Credit would not<br />\nbe extended on this system\u2014cash<br />\nin advance only.<br />\nWhat I am suggesting is in no<br />\nway revolutionary. Look at airports, for example. Airports are<br />\nperfect examples of situation<br />\nmonopolies in self-contained,<br />\nisolated markets. Until recently,<br />\none company usually controlled<br />\nthe whole airport's food service<br />\nsystem. Quality was typically<br />\nbad, prices were high, and if people were hungry between flights,<br />\nthey had no choice but to suffer<br />\nthe consequences\u2014starve or pay!<br />\nThis is still the case in many<br />\nairports, but some airports have<br />\nbecome smart. Even though airports are clearly political institutions, increased privatization is<br />\nleading to increased competition<br />\ninside the airports. Instead of<br />\nchoosing between two different<br />\ncafeterias, people can now choose<br />\nbetween a cafeteria and Au Bon<br />\n<br />\nCorrecting<br />\nCouncil<br />\nLimitations<br />\nDIAMOND, from 10<br />\nwould not be impossible to push<br />\nthe administration to draw up a<br />\nplan for divestment along with its<br />\nconsequences. Then those who<br />\ndecide can decide on the basis of<br />\nfactual information.<br />\nNow correct me if I'm wrong<br />\nbut about the only thing the NewsLetter leaves the council to do is<br />\nto throw parties and to waste time<br />\ntalking about the Hopkins psyche.<br />\nThen once the council does just<br />\nthat the newspaper corrects them<br />\nfor it, in the midst of this sea of<br />\nvagueness and malaise.<br />\nSo I was hanging out with my<br />\nold roommate Paul and he said,<br />\n\"F--ck it, I'm going to run for<br />\nStudent Council President.\" And<br />\nthe campaign was off. So now<br />\nyou know. Hopefully this student<br />\ncouncil will not be an insult to our<br />\nintelligence, but you never know.<br />\nI beg your pardon for not having literary talent, but I hope I<br />\nhave made my point clear. There<br />\nare real, concrete things which<br />\nneed to be done on campus, not<br />\njust some vague nonsense to be<br />\ntalked about.<br />\n<br />\nPain, Haagen-Dazs, etc. BWI<br />\ncould certainly take some lessons.<br />\nPractically everyone persists in<br />\ncomplaining about the quality and<br />\nprices of the meal plan here, but<br />\nvery few attempts are made to<br />\nchange it. Hopkins would do well<br />\nto examine the \"Adam Smith<br />\nalternative.\" It's been around for<br />\na long time, and it works. It's<br />\ncalled the free market.<br />\n<br />\nslurs, explaining that if any of us<br />\nwere offended here, we should<br />\nstop processing right then and<br />\nthere, for on the street we would<br />\nbe called every word that this<br />\npaper could not, or would not,<br />\nprint.<br />\nI was told to report back the<br />\nfollowing Thursday for further<br />\nprocessing, including a physical<br />\nexamination, fingerprinting, and<br />\nother such things. I was given a<br />\nlist of certain documents to bring,<br />\nincluding my high school<br />\ndiploma, Military Discharge Certificate, my SS-14, DD-209,<br />\npassport, drivers license, and a<br />\nletter from my fourth grade<br />\nteacher attesting to my good<br />\nbehavior during that year.<br />\nAssembling these documents posed a bit of a problem, as my birth<br />\ncertificate and high school<br />\n<br />\ndiploma were in New York, and informed me that an AIDS test<br />\nI, not yet having told my parents was also being performed on the<br />\nof my plans, realized that a little sly. I was fingerprinted and sent<br />\ndeception was necessary to avoid for a back X-ray as well. I felt a<br />\nany premature sacrificing of bar- little bit like a sheep going<br />\nnyard animals on the part of my through shearing and measuring<br />\nprior to becoming lambchop, but<br />\nmother.<br />\nI informed my dad that I need- I didn't bleat once, and took it all<br />\ned these documents for some standing up.<br />\nsecret ceremony which I couldn't<br />\nI then went back to the evil<br />\ntell him about, and could he woman mentioned in Week One<br />\nplease send them. My father, of this series, and she scowled<br />\nhaving an inherently suspicious that if everything went alright, all<br />\ncharacter as it is, knew something my tests came out with desired<br />\nwas up, but trusted my discretion results, and my wool was up to<br />\nand 'sent the requested items.

In fact, college costs so little and<br />\noffers so many amenities that unemployed young adults have tended<br />\nto go there. (Here in Massachusetts, however, when college enrollment is declining, the people whose job it is to worry about such things<br />\nsay some students are going to work instead of to college because<br />\nof the rising demand in business and industry for employees.)<br />\nIn addition to providing a range of services to students, colleges<br />\ndo great things for society. Social scientists have found that, compared with the rest of the adult population, college graduates pay more<br />\ntaxes, are more likely to vote, have a lower divorce rate, volunteer<br />\nmore often for good works in their communities, and are less likely<br />\n<br />\nto go to jail.<br />\nConsidering all the benefits colleges provide both their students and<br />\nthe country for a daily fee that might get you a night\u2014but no meals\u2014in<br />\na Holiday Inn, I wonder that the Secretary doesn't change his tune<br />\nand urge colleges to raise tuition, so that the goose that lays the golden<br />\neggs can continue to do so.<br />\nKeeping colleges financially healthy by sharing the cost to students<br />\nof obviously necessary tuition increases is one of the important reasons<br />\nfor federal student-aid programs. (The more significan purpose, of<br />\ncourse, is to make sure that needy students get a chance to go to<br />\ncollege).<br />\nThe federal government obviously has an interest in colleges being efficiently managed. But achieving that efficiency is the institutions' business, not the government's. The fact that colleges are providing a rich environment for learning at a relatively low annual fee<br />\nshould be enough evidence of their commitment to good management<br />\nto satisfy the Secretary and the rest of us.<br />\nHarold Howe, II, is a senior lecturer at Harvard University Graduate<br />\nSchool ofEducation.

Gum<br />\nIn the wake of Super Tuesday,<br />\npolitical activism is alive and well<br />\namong Hopkins students.<br />\nStudents on all sides of the<br />\npolitical spectrum are participating in various presidential<br />\ncampaigns. Some have worked<br />\nfor candidates off-campus.<br />\nOn-campus activities include a<br />\nrally held Friday by supporters of<br />\npresidential candidate, the<br />\n<br />\nReverend Jesse Jackson at<br />\nShriver Hall. This event was attended by several hundred<br />\nstudents from colleges around the<br />\nBaltimore area. Jay Kaufman,<br />\nwho attended the rally, believes<br />\nthat the gathering showed a lot of<br />\nenthusiasm and \"was very encouraging for\" Jackson supporters. Kaufman thinks his candidate will do well on Super<br />\nTuesday and that the \"huge<br />\ndelegate pool\" Jackson is amass-<br />\n<br />\ning \"Will give him a strong influence at the Democratic convention.\"<br />\nSupporters of Governor<br />\nMichael Dukakis have manned a<br />\ntable two days a week in Levering Hall. There, they have passed out information about their<br />\ncandidate and put other supporters in contact with the local<br />\nDukakis headquarters.<br />\nFor the GOP, individual<br />\nmembers of the College<br />\nRepublicans have worked for<br />\nvarious Republican candidates<br />\nwith the exceptions of Vice President George Bush and the<br />\nReverend Pat Robertson. No oncampus activities have been<br />\norganized for Republican<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nOff-campus, Hopkins students<br />\nhave done a variety of things.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins students made<br />\nthe trip to New Hampshire to<br />\nwork for candidates Senator Paul<br />\n<br />\nSimon, Governor Bruce Babbitt,<br />\nand Governor Dukakis during the<br />\ncritical days right before the<br />\nprimary. Freshman Jonathan<br />\nRoberts, who worked for Simon,<br />\nthought New Hampshire \"was a<br />\nwonderful experience in the<br />\npolitical process.\" Roberts had<br />\nthe opportunity to meet candidates Jackson and Senator<br />\nAlbert Gore as well as Gore's<br />\nwife, Tipper.<br />\nOther students are working for<br />\nBaltimore area campaign offices<br />\nof candidates who have survived<br />\npast Iowa and New Hampshire.<br />\nSeveral students have been working at the local headquarters of<br />\neach of the candidates Congressman Richard Gephardt,<br />\nDukakis, and Gore. Senior Andrea Garolfalo and junior Bret<br />\nDerman and other Dukakis supporters work the phone bank at<br />\nDukakis headquarters.

After creating<br />\nZippy in 1970, Griffith published the antics of his character in<br />\nunderground newspapers and<br />\npublications. Later, he brought<br />\nhis strip to the pages of National<br />\nLampoon, a move that he says<br />\nbridged the gap between<br />\nunderground and daily syndication. In 1986, the San Francisco<br />\nExaminer offered to publish a dai-<br />\n<br />\nly \"Zippy the Pinhead \u2014 strip.<br />\nGriffitht'created the original<br />\nZippy character for an<br />\nunderground comic-love story<br />\nparody called, \"I Fell in Love<br />\nwith a Pinhead, but He Made a<br />\nFool Out of Me.\" Pinheads, or<br />\nmicrocephalics, have fascinated<br />\nGriffith ever since he watched the<br />\n1932 movie, \"Freaks,\" which<br />\nstarred real circus side-show<br />\nfreaks.

Zippy may be a pinhead,<br />\nbut he is not pointless.\"<br />\nGriffith describes his audience<br />\nas \"bizarre, but intellectual,\" and<br />\nmostly college-age. Yet there is<br />\nno single description of his<br />\nreadership, which includes two<br />\n96-year old twins who regularly<br />\nsend fan letters, and a man who<br />\nlikes to mail junk-food wrappers.<br />\nNot everyone loves Zippy, and<br />\nthere is enough hate mail to prove<br />\nit. One reader in Denver insists<br />\nthat Zippy is \"a communist who<br />\nencourages masturbation.\" Griffith attributes such attitudes to<br />\npeople who read Zippy, do not<br />\nunderstand it, and consequently<br />\n<br />\nget angry. \"But,\" he says,<br />\n\"those adamantly anti-Zippy people become the strongest Zippy<br />\nfans.\"<br />\nWith Zippy, Griffith hopes to<br />\n:.-.fluence other cartoonists to<br />\n<br />\n\"Zippy may be a<br />\npinhead, but he is not<br />\npointless.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u2014Bill Griffith<br />\ncreate strips with more substance<br />\ninstead of only punch lines. \"Daily strips just sit there on the<br />\npage,\" he says. \"Unlike in the<br />\n'20s and '30s, people today expect very little of them.\"<br />\nUnderground comics like Weirdo, Raw, and Life in Hell are<br />\namong Griffith's favorite strips,<br />\nwhile he \"mildly likes\" The Far<br />\nSide, Calvin and Hobbes, and<br />\n<br />\nDoonesbury. Bloom County, probably the country's most popular<br />\nstrip, especially among collegeaged readers, is Griffith's personal anathema. \"I know,<br />\neverybody likes Bloom County,<br />\nbut I just don't. It's too white<br />\nbread, too cutesy, and too pleasant.\"<br />\nGriffith plans to take Zippy as<br />\nfar as he can.

Where<br />\nthese people are getting their impressions is beyond me, because<br />\nif they've been frequenting such<br />\nplaces as Max's on Broadway<br />\nand the 8x10, they should've<br />\ncome across such local faves as<br />\nRed Tape and When Thunder<br />\nComes.<br />\nBoth these groups have enough<br />\nof a local base, in fact, to have<br />\nput out some vinyl on Frantic<br />\nRecords, an indie label run out of<br />\nThe Commercial Refinery, a<br />\nrecording studio located at 2105<br />\nMaryland Avenue, a scant four<br />\nblocks from your faithful critic's<br />\nhome. Red Tape's first album is<br />\nsimple called Red Tape, while<br />\nWhen Tunder Comes' most recent album is entitled Eves ofthe<br />\nWolf. (WTC also released two<br />\nalbums under the name The Mission, which must have resulted in<br />\nsome legal problems with the<br />\nBritish group of the same name.)<br />\nWhen Thunder Comes sounds<br />\na lot like Bauhaus on a first listen,<br />\nprimarily because of the Peter<br />\nMurphy-isms of frontman David<br />\nJ. Cawkwell (which, unfortunately, are destined to get them written off as Bauhaus imitators).<br />\nUpon repeated spins, however, it<br />\nbecomes quickly apparent that<br />\nthere are some significantly dif-<br />\n<br />\nferent things going on. WTC has \"Urban Sub-Urban\" with its<br />\ndispensed with Bauhaus' acoustic clean, crisp rhythm section<br />\ntendencies, and gone for an (which often sounds mushy or a<br />\nAmerican-style guitar attack bit over-done on some of the<br />\nbacked up with keyboards.

Most people can<br />\nhandle these situations in a<br />\nhealthy, rational manner, but<br />\nthere are those who allow them<br />\nto get out of hand and develop the<br />\neating disorders anorexia nervosa<br />\n(which literally means \"loss of<br />\nappetite\" but is a bit of a<br />\nmisnomer, as shall be seen later)<br />\nand bulimia (bingeing on huge<br />\namounts of food and then purging by vomiting or taking<br />\nlaxitives).<br />\nThese eating disorders are what<br />\nNancy J. Kolodny discusses in<br />\nWhen Food's a Foe: How to Confront and Conquer Eating<br />\nDisorders. In the book, Kolodny<br />\nexplains what eating disorders<br />\nare, how they begin, and how it<br />\nis possible to get them under<br />\ncontrol.<br />\nThe book is quite easy to read,<br />\n<br />\nas it seems to be aimed mostly at<br />\nteenagers, who are the most frequent victims of eating disorders.<br />\nThis is a topic that everyone<br />\nshould be concerned with, simply because anyone can develop an<br />\neating disorder. Eating disorders<br />\ndo not merely affect the victim,<br />\n<br />\nbut everyone around the victim as<br />\nwell.<br />\nKolodny has filled the book<br />\nwith helpful self-quizzes to aid<br />\nthe reader in determining if he is<br />\nat risk of developing an eating<br />\ndisorder. Actually, the selfconfidence quizzes are interesting<br />\n<br />\nto take, because even if you don't<br />\nfind that you're at risk, you can<br />\nstill learn a thing or two about<br />\nyourself. There are also many<br />\nbrief testimonials from victims<br />\nand their friends.<br />\nKolodny takes the reader into<br />\nthe discussion of eating disorders<br />\n<br />\nrt><br />\n1)<br />\n<br />\nHow Do<br />\n<br />\ns')<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nci<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nYou See<br />\nYourself?<br />\nPart One of Two<br />\n<br />\n;\"<br />\n,41.4<br />\n<br />\nMen are satisfied with their looks.

The<br />\ndisorders develop when a person<br />\nhas trouble with a negative selfimage. He feels unable to ever<br />\nmeasure up to personal standards<br />\nof beauty, intellegence, or<br />\nwhatever. In addition, anorectics<br />\nand bulimics \"don't often give<br />\nthemselves credit for the things<br />\nthey're good at.\"<br />\nHabits are very important to<br />\nKolodny's explanation of eating<br />\ndisorders\u2014it is her contention<br />\nthat anorexia and bulimia are<br />\nhabits that have gotten out of control. A person can get addicted to<br />\nan eating disorder in much the<br />\nsame way he can become addicted to alcohol or drugs. In fact,<br />\nsubstituting the words \"alcohol\"<br />\nor \"drugs\" in many places in this<br />\nbook can be helpful towards overcoming these addictions too.<br />\n\"The transformation of habits<br />\ninto obsessions, compulsions, or<br />\naddictions is often terrible, but it<br />\ndoesn't have to be terminal,\"<br />\nKolodny says.

Doctors Lee Randol Barker and<br />\nDavid Evans Kern think that they<br />\nhave solved this problem. Barker<br />\nand Kern conduct a month-long<br />\nprogram for medical residents in<br />\ninternal medicine, teaching doctors the proper way to deal with<br />\npatients of all kinds. As part of<br />\nthe Wednesday Noon Series, Drs.<br />\nBarker and Kern, co-directors of<br />\nthe Division of General Internal<br />\nMedicine at the Francis Scott Key<br />\nMedical Center and faculty<br />\nmembers at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Medicine, discussed<br />\n\"Teaching doctors to communicate with patients.\"<br />\nDr. Barker first asked the audience to express the problems<br />\nthey encountered at the physi-<br />\n<br />\ncian's office. Most of the<br />\nresponses seemed to indicate a<br />\npublic unsatisfied with their doctor visits, and most complaints<br />\nwere legitimate, according to<br />\nBarker. People complained that<br />\nthe visits were often rushed and<br />\nsometimes interrupted by phone<br />\ncalls or other distractions. The<br />\ndoctor would often either explain<br />\nthe patient's condition in medical<br />\nterms too complex for the patient,<br />\nor would oversimplify the condition. Barker and Kern condensed the most common complaints<br />\ninto six categories. They are the<br />\nphysician's failure to:<br />\n\u2014Listen<br />\n\u2014Clarify patient's problems<br />\n\u2014Respond to concerns and<br />\npsychological needs<br />\n\u2014Educate and motivate<br />\n\u2014Get the most out of available<br />\ntime<br />\nTo illustrate the difference a<br />\nfew behavioral changes can make<br />\non the doctor-patient relationship,<br />\nDrs. Barker and Kern showed a<br />\nvideotape, simulating a particularly hard subject to deal with:<br />\ninforming a patient that she has<br />\ncancer. After having a polyp<br />\nremoved from her colon, the pa-<br />\n<br />\ntient returns to the physician's office to learn the results of the<br />\ntissue biopsy. The first doctor is<br />\nsensitive and has a gentle voice,<br />\nbut when the patient becomes<br />\nupset, he continues to describe<br />\nthe medical explanation. Dr.<br />\nKern emphasized that when a patient is upset, they often will not<br />\neven hear what the physician is<br />\nsaying. Furthermore, the doctor<br />\nhas already made plans for the patient' surgery. According to<br />\nthe input of the patient is<br />\nKern,<br />\n_<br />\nessential to help alleviate his or<br />\nher anxiety.<br />\nBy contrast, the second doctor<br />\nseems to hold a conversation with<br />\nthe patient, as opposed to the first<br />\ndoctor's monologue. He is not<br />\nafraid to use the word cancer in<br />\ndiscussing the condition. When<br />\nthe patient becomes upset, he<br />\ncomforts her, and gives her time<br />\nto ask questions. The patient is<br />\npermitted to arrange her own<br />\nsurgery time, etc. This gives the<br />\npatient more control over her<br />\nsituation. These changes in<br />\nbehavior between the two doctors<br />\nseems to be minor, but in<br />\ntraumatic times, every little thing<br />\nmakes the difference.<br />\n<br />\nDrs. Barker and Kern also<br />\ndiscussed the importance of<br />\nand<br />\nbiomedical<br />\ntreating<br />\nsymptoms<br />\npsychological<br />\ntogether. Quite often, says Kern,<br />\ndoctors separate the two.<br />\nHowever, psychological symptoms sometimes manifest<br />\nthemselves in physical conditions. For example, fatigue, lack<br />\nof sleep, and lack of hunger are<br />\nsometimes indicative of depression. A person who has an<br />\nunderlying mental illness usually visits his general physician<br />\nbefore a specialist. Therefore,<br />\nDr. Kern says that doctors should<br />\nbe especially careful in their<br />\nobservations of their patients'<br />\nemotional state.<br />\nHow are physicians taught<br />\nthese interpersonal skills? In their<br />\nprogram, Drs. Barker and Kern<br />\nuse a variety of methods. The<br />\nfirst is role playing between the<br />\nteaching physician and the<br />\nmedical resident. The doctors<br />\ngave an example of role playing<br />\nby acting out the same scenario<br />\nseen on the videotape. Dr. Kern<br />\ncalls the role playing \"active<br />\nlearning\u2014learning by practice,<br />\nnot by lecture or by watching<br />\n<br />\nother physicians.\" Another advantage of role playing is that<br />\nresidents can test out different<br />\nresponses in a \"safe situation.\"<br />\nThey can call time out and start<br />\nover at any time. Other methods<br />\nthat Barker and Kern use are<br />\nsimulated patients, people who<br />\nare paid to act out certain<br />\nscenarios, residents are exposed<br />\nto alcoholism, marital problems,<br />\nand hypochondriacs. Through<br />\nvideo review, the resident can see<br />\nhimself in action and discuss problems with his peers. Finally, by<br />\nactually observing in person other<br />\nphysicians' relationships with<br />\ntheir patients, the resident sees<br />\nthe skills \"integrated into a real<br />\ntime frame,\" as opposed to the<br />\n\"safe situations\" that are part of<br />\nthe other techniques.<br />\nA poor patient-doctor relationship can have sever consequences, says Dr. Kern. They include inaccurate diagnosis, an<br />\nunhappy patient, misuse of<br />\ntherapy by a patient, and<br />\nultimately malpractice suits. In<br />\nlight of such serious results, Dr.<br />\nKern wonders why more time is<br />\nnot spent teaching medical<br />\nstudents these important skills.<br />\n<br />\nSpring Cleaning: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust<br />\nby Denise A. Ross<br />\nHumans shed about 1.5 grams<br />\nof skin every day. Most of this<br />\n,skin becomes dust atop furniture<br />\nand floors. Should you doubt this,<br />\ngather some dust and burn it. It<br />\nwill smell like singed skin.<br />\nThe idea that most of your<br />\n\"house dust\" is really \"people<br />\ndust\" makes the thought of even<br />\nwalking across your floor, not to<br />\nmention placing cooking utensils<br />\non the counter, rather repulsive.<br />\nEvery person who has set foot in<br />\nyour home has left a small<br />\nmoment() for you to treasure,<br />\ntread on, or inhale, as the case<br />\nmay be. Not a pleasant thought.<br />\nThe ideal situation would be to<br />\nbring a halt to dividing skin cells.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is not possible while we are still alive. Skin<br />\ngrows and renews itself at all<br />\ntimes. One of its most important<br />\nfunctions is to produce the dead<br />\nhorny layer of keratin which protects the organism from the<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nThe outer layer of skin is called the epidermis. It can be<br />\nseparated into several layers.<br />\nFrom the bottom to the top they<br />\nare: the basal layer, the spiny<br />\nlayer, the granular layer, and the<br />\nhorny layer.<br />\nIn human epidermis, the cells<br />\nof the basal layer are usually<br />\nsomewhat cubic in shape. This<br />\nlayer produces all the cells in the<br />\nepidermis.<br />\nThe cells of the basal layer<br />\ndivide by a process known as<br />\nmitosis. When the cells divide,<br />\nthey begin to move up into the<br />\nnext layer of the epidermis, the<br />\nspiny layer. As the cells ascend,<br />\nthey change shape. The cells of<br />\nthe spiny layer are polyhedral and<br />\nbecome increasingly flattened as<br />\nthey are squeezed into the<br />\ngranular layer.<br />\nThe cells of the granular layer<br />\nae characterized by granules of<br />\nprotein called keratin. These cells<br />\n<br />\ndo not divide. Instead, they begin<br />\nto change shape into the outer<br />\nskin cells which are called<br />\nkeratinocytes. As the cells of the<br />\ngranular layer age and migrate<br />\noutward, the keratin granules<br />\nbecome more prominent. The<br />\npressure from the dividing cells<br />\nbelow causes the cells to become<br />\nflattened sacs of keratin protein<br />\nknown as the horny layer.<br />\nFrom the day you are born, the<br />\ndead cells of the horny layer are<br />\nshed and replaced by new cells<br />\ncoming up from the granular<br />\nlayer. In adult skin, a cell born<br />\nin the basal layer takes approximately two weeks to reach the<br />\nhorny layer.<br />\nIt is generally agreed that cell<br />\ndivision in the epidermis occurs<br />\nchiefly in the basal layer.<br />\nHowever, there has been some<br />\ndisagreement about this. The<br />\nfollowing experiment illustrates<br />\nthat most of the epidermis'<br />\n\u2022mitotic activity does take place in<br />\nthe basal layer.<br />\nIn this experiment, a single<br />\nlayer of horny cells is removed by<br />\napplying a piece of scotch tape to<br />\na subject's arm and quickly pulling it off. Under the microscope<br />\nyou can see a single layer of<br />\nkeratinized cells adhering to the<br />\nsticky surface. Repeat the process<br />\nover the same area of skin until<br />\nthe surface becomes red and<br />\nshiny but remains dry. Stain each<br />\nsection and make counts of<br />\ndividing cells, mitotic counts.<br />\nA complete stripping of the<br />\nhorny layer is accompanied by<br />\nsome cell damage, hyperemia<br />\n(excesses of blood in the body<br />\npart), and mild inflammation of<br />\nthe layer under the epidermis, the<br />\ndermis. This could cause mitotic<br />\nactivity. However, the loss of less<br />\nskin can lead to appreciable<br />\nmitotic activity without the above<br />\ndamage.<br />\nApproximately half of the mitotic counts occur in the basal<br />\n<br />\nlayer. The other half occur in the<br />\nspiny layer. Only a few mitotic<br />\ncounts are said to occur in the<br />\nhigher layers of the spiny layer.<br />\nTo appreciate the significance<br />\nof this observation, the change<br />\nwhich occurs in the epidermis<br />\nafter the tape treatment is observed. During the first 72 hours, the<br />\nbasal cells increase the space they<br />\noccupy while their numbers are<br />\n<br />\ndecreasing. However, they continue to divide at the same rate as<br />\nbefore. A large percentage of the<br />\nmitotic counts attributed to the<br />\nspiny layer are really basal cells<br />\nwhich have been crowded out of<br />\nspace.<br />\nMost tissues have an intrinsic<br />\npotential for cell division which<br />\nis related to the normal loss of<br />\ncells. It is possible that the rate<br />\n<br />\nof loss itself may to some extent<br />\nbe dependent upon the rate of<br />\nproduction. No one is quite sure<br />\nwhat the case is, or how we can<br />\nstop ourselves from slowly<br />\nchanging into dust. Until it is<br />\nfigured out, maybe it's time to<br />\nbreak out those vacuum cleaners<br />\nand do your spring cleaning a little early.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins Science Beat<br />\nBecoming a Doctor<br />\nThe \"Hospital as a Human Institution\" will again be presenting<br />\na lecture for the JHMI humanities<br />\nseries.

Hormes, a sophomore,<br />\nscored 7 goals in the season<br />\nopener against Lynchburg and<br />\nchalked up a goal arri an assist in<br />\nthe 17-5 loss at Chapel Hill. Also<br />\nback are seniors Paul Deniken<br />\nand Paul Miller, who combined<br />\nfor 29 goals and 9 assists last<br />\nseason. Deniken has been<br />\nawesome in the early season,<br />\nscoring 6 goals in the 28-4 victory over Lynchburg and two<br />\ngoals against Carolina.

They will be joined<br />\nby juniors Walt Spence and Matt<br />\nKelly, freshmen Ben Lamana and<br />\nRon Council, and sophomore<br />\nMark Cavallaro.

This<br />\nmove would, in effect, reduce the<br />\npower of the position in the administrative structure.<br />\nThe main concern for students,<br />\nnoted FitzGerald, is whether or<br />\nnot the person replacing Welch<br />\nwill have the power to be as effective as Welch has been. \"Will<br />\nthe new system be beneficial or<br />\nharmful to students?\" asked<br /><br />\nFitzGerald.<br />\nOf equal importance is the<br />\nbudgetary situation for the new<br />\nposition. After meeting with<br />\nArmstrong and VandeLinde, FitzGerald noted some confusion<br />\nregarding exactly to whom Welch<br />\nsubmitted his budget proposal.<br />\nThis confusion, he said, is important because an autonomous<br />\nbudget for the position would<br />\ngive Welch's replacement some<br />\nsense of authority and responsibility even if he would need to<br />\nreport directly to the academic<br />\ndeans on other issues.<br />\nFitzGerald commented, \"If<br /><br />\nGiangiulio wins SC presidency;<br />\nEight left in Young Trustee bid<br />\nELECTIONS, from 1<br />\ndirector of the Hopkins Organization for Programming.

Howard<br />\nBaetjer, a doctoral student at George<br />\nMason University, extolled, \"The New<br />\nLiberal Case for Laissez-Faire\" at a lecture Wednesday in Roland Hall.<br />\nAs a member of The Institute for<br />\nHumane Studies, a libertarian think-tank<br />\nat George Mason, Baefjer presented the<br />\nphilosophical reasons for a completely free<br />\nmarket society in 1988.<br />\nBaetjer's argument centers around the<br />\nindividual's rights as opposed to government's authority. \"If rights precede<br />\ngovernment,\" he said, \"and if governments are created by people, than logically government cannot have any rightful<br />\nauthority beyond that what the individuals<br />\nthat set it up had to give it.\"<br />\nFundamental among those rights is the<br />\nright to property. Baetjer contended that<br />\ngovernment should not interfere with the<br />\nindividual's economic freedoms. \"I doubt<br />\nthat individuals have a right to use force<br />\naggressively to get what they want from<br />\nsomebody else,\" he said. \"We can't turn<br />\nover to government that sort of authority.<br />\nJust as it is wrong for you to steal a handbag or a car,\" he continued, \"it's wrong<br />\nfor the government to take the handbag or<br />\nthe car, even if it's to distribute the goods<br />\nto the needy or to use the car to transport<br /><br />\nthe handicapped, Government does not<br />\nhave the right to take property, even if it's<br />\nto do good deeds with.\"<br />\nBaetjer envisioned a society \"where<br />\nthere is a virtual separation between<br />\neconomy and state.\" He claimed that his<br />\ntheory is not pro-business but pro-market.<br />\nIn this society, government's role would<br />\nbe reduced to \"keeping the peace and enforcing contracts.<br />\n\"If things are left alone, there will<br />\nemerge a wonderfully orderly society,\"<br />\nhe remarked. \"Government's attempt to<br />\nimpose a direction on society's economic<br />\ndevelopment injects chaos into order.\"<br />\nAccording to Baetjer, special interest<br />\ngroups corrupt government, and regulations result, benefitting a minority while<br />\nhurting the rest. While conceding that a<br />\nfree market society [in the libertarian<br />\nsense] might not be perfect, Baetjer called it the best possible solution.<br />\nRacism, environmental destruction, and<br />\nbelligerence, he said, are institutionalized<br />\ninto law, by special interest groups. The<br />\nfree market, instead would penalize those<br />\nwho perpetrated such policies by making<br />\nthese policies uneconomical to carry out.<br />\nBaetjer cited South Africa as a case in<br />\npoint. \"The white supremacist unions advocate a minimum wage to disadvantage<br />\nblacks,\" he said, explaining that the unions<br />\nseek to make the cost of hiring blacks as<br />\ncheap labor prohibitive to employers.

The<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is a<br /><br />\nfood-service monopoly dommated by the Seiler's Corporation. The Terrace Room, Levering, the Snack Bar, and even the<br />\nsoda and change machines are run<br />\nby Seiler's because of an umbrella contract signed with the<br />\nuniversity giving them market exclusivity.

Bennett has been making headlines<br />\nwith the charge that American colleges are irresponsibly increasing<br />\ntuition without first making their operations more efficient. He is<br />\ngrousing about the increases because the Education Department pays<br />\na good percentage of the college costs of needy students, and when<br />\ncolleges raise tuition to get more money, his department must either<br />\ncontribute more or help fewer students.<br />\nCollege presidents have responded with salvos about inadequate<br />\nfaculty salaries, increasing maintenance costs, and the care with which<br />\ntheir frugal budgets are planned. But as far as I know, none of them<br />\nhas pointed out what a bargain a college education is today.<br />\nConsider the arithmetic of what it costs a college to educate a student for a year. While there is a wide variation among institutions,<br />\non average it requires about $12,000 per student to provide all the<br />\nservices at a residential college. The money to pay for those services<br />\ncomes from various sources, depending on whether the college is<br />\nprivate or public and on family circumstances. In general, a typical<br />\nstudent's family actually pays less than half the cost of his or her higher<br />\neducation.<br />\nTo pursue the arithmetic further, since students are in college about<br />\n200 days a year, the cost of a day of education works out to an average<br />\nof $60. I can't help wondering if the Secretary has ever taken a careful<br />\nlook at what students get for that money (much of which comes from<br />\nthe colleges themselves and outside agencies).

It certainly isn't for lack<br />\nof problems. For starters, let's<br />\ntalk about the service monopolies<br />\nwhich Hopkins contracts out: the<br />\ncafeteria, the bank, the dormitories' washers and dryers, and<br />\nthe bookstore. Every year we<br />\nforce our freshmen to eat low<br />\nquality food at exorbitant prices<br />\nand to use washers and dryers<br />\nthat were never meant to stand up<br />\nto the abuse that they take. Every<br /><br />\nyear people complain about their<br />\ntreatment at First National, but<br />\nput up with it because of its convenience. Lately, the bookstore,<br />\nwhich has us in a choke hold, has<br />\ndecided that it will no longer buy<br />\nback text books at half-price.<br />\nNow when I read the NewsLetter, I am told that the issue for<br />\nthis campaign is the Hopkins<br />\npsyche and on-campus housing.<br />\nLet's talk about this a little bit.<br />\nYes, on-campus housing is a problem, but there are already plans<br />\nfor more dorms and adding more<br />\nthan that would begin to disturb<br />\nthe beauty of the campus. Face it,<br />\nwe can't all live on campus. Instead, off-campus housing should<br />\nbe more centrally organized than<br />\nit currently is. Now for the other<br />\nproblem\u2014the Hopkins psyche. If<br />\nyou expect any great change<br /><br />\nyou're going to be banging your<br />\nhead against a wall. The<br />\n\"throatism\" will not go away until you give premeds guaranteed<br />\nadmissions into med school. Part<br />\nof this is caused by the course<br />\nworkload. Last year a magazine<br />\nrated Hopkins as having the<br />\nhighest workload anywhere. The<br />\nonly thing I can suggest is to take<br />\nengineering courses where it<br />\ndoesn't matter how much you<br />\nstudy, only how well you understand it, or creative courses like<br />\nwriting sems where quantity does<br />\nnot matter.<br />\nAs for \"sexual intolerance\" it<br />\nis my opinion that someone is using the News-Letter as a platform<br />\nto shovel this B.S.

The alleged essence of<br />\nLindsay's letter is her concern<br />\nthat a rumored revision in the<br />\nLetters Policy, limiting letters to<br />\nthe editor to those which pertain<br />\nto campus-related issues, will inhibit \"greater understanding of<br />\nworld events among Hopkins<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nFirst, writing a letter based on<br />\na rumor is poor scholarship and<br />\nreveals that Lindsay is not truly<br />\nconcerned enough over the<br />\nrumored change in policy to<br />\nverify whether or not the rumor<br />\nis substantive. If Lindsay were as<br />\nconcerned as she would like us to<br />\nbelieve, she could have easily inquired of the editors themselves<br />\nif the rumored policy revision<br />\nwere true. If the real motivation<br /><br />\nbehind Lindsay's letter was not to<br />\nprotest a revised Letter Policy,<br />\nwhat was her hidden agenda?<br />\nPerhaps a politicized account of<br />\nrecent South African events?<br />\nWhatever Lindsay's motivation,<br />\nher letter strikes me as disingenuous in its appeal to maintain the present Letters Policy.<br />\nNot to denigrate the content of<br />\nthe News-Letter or affront its<br />\nstaff, but the more egregious of<br />\nLindsay's transgressions is her<br />\nassertion that the school paper<br />\nprovides Hopkins students with a<br />\nsignificant part of their exposure<br />\nto world events. This contention<br />\nis asinine. Not only is a weekly<br />\nstudent publication which<br />\nprimarily deals with campusrelated issues a poor medium<br />\nthrough which to keep abreast of<br />\nglobal events, but those students<br />\nwho do rely on the News-Letter<br />\nfor such purposes are in sorry<br />\nshape indeed.

(Here in Massachusetts, however, when college enrollment is declining, the people whose job it is to worry about such things<br />\nsay some students are going to work instead of to college because<br />\nof the rising demand in business and industry for employees.)<br />\nIn addition to providing a range of services to students, colleges<br />\ndo great things for society.

Paul Simon.<br /><br />\nPresidential campaign<br />\nprovides opportunity<br />\nfor political activism...<br />\non campus and off<br />\nby Erica E. Gum<br />\nIn the wake of Super Tuesday,<br />\npolitical activism is alive and well<br />\namong Hopkins students.<br />\nStudents on all sides of the<br />\npolitical spectrum are participating in various presidential<br />\ncampaigns. Some have worked<br />\nfor candidates off-campus.<br />\nOn-campus activities include a<br />\nrally held Friday by supporters of<br />\npresidential candidate, the<br /><br />\nReverend Jesse Jackson at<br />\nShriver Hall. This event was attended by several hundred<br />\nstudents from colleges around the<br />\nBaltimore area. Jay Kaufman,<br />\nwho attended the rally, believes<br />\nthat the gathering showed a lot of<br />\nenthusiasm and \"was very encouraging for\" Jackson supporters. Kaufman thinks his candidate will do well on Super<br />\nTuesday and that the \"huge<br />\ndelegate pool\" Jackson is amass-<br /><br />\ning \"Will give him a strong influence at the Democratic convention.\"<br />\nSupporters of Governor<br />\nMichael Dukakis have manned a<br />\ntable two days a week in Levering Hall. There, they have passed out information about their<br />\ncandidate and put other supporters in contact with the local<br />\nDukakis headquarters.<br />\nFor the GOP, individual<br />\nmembers of the College<br />\nRepublicans have worked for<br />\nvarious Republican candidates<br />\nwith the exceptions of Vice President George Bush and the<br />\nReverend Pat Robertson. No oncampus activities have been<br />\norganized for Republican<br />\ncandidates.<br />\nOff-campus, Hopkins students<br />\nhave done a variety of things.<br />\nSeveral Hopkins students made<br />\nthe trip to New Hampshire to<br />\nwork for candidates Senator Paul<br /><br />\nSimon, Governor Bruce Babbitt,<br />\nand Governor Dukakis during the<br />\ncritical days right before the<br />\nprimary. Freshman Jonathan<br />\nRoberts, who worked for Simon,<br />\nthought New Hampshire \"was a<br />\nwonderful experience in the<br />\npolitical process.\" Roberts had<br />\nthe opportunity to meet candidates Jackson and Senator<br />\nAlbert Gore as well as Gore's<br />\nwife, Tipper.<br />\nOther students are working for<br />\nBaltimore area campaign offices<br />\nof candidates who have survived<br />\npast Iowa and New Hampshire.<br />\nSeveral students have been working at the local headquarters of<br />\neach of the candidates Congressman Richard Gephardt,<br />\nDukakis, and Gore. Senior Andrea Garolfalo and junior Bret<br />\nDerman and other Dukakis supporters work the phone bank at<br />\nDukakis headquarters. Student<br />\nsupporters of Gore have written<br />\npress releases and manned the<br />\npolls on Super Tuesday.<br />\nWhy have students chosen the<br />\ncandidates that they have? Lisa<br />\nLindsay, a Jackson supporter,<br />\nbelieves her candidate \"will have<br />\na great influence in changing the<br />\nway government is run. . . by the<br />\npower he will have in influencing<br />\nthe choice of federal appointments.\"<br />\nDerman supports Dukakis<br />\nbecause he believes the<br />\nMassachusetts Governor is some-<br /><br />\nwill win the GOP nomination, but<br />\nhe hopes that he will be chosen<br />\nas Bush's running mate.<br />\nSome students who are very interested in politics have chosen<br />\nnot to support any of the present<br />\ncandidates. According to David<br />\nOlstein, president of the Young<br />\nDemocrats, \"it's very difficult to<br />\nalign yourself with a candidate<br />\nwhen so much rides on the Iowa<br />\nand New Hampshire primaries.<br />\nTo put in a great deal of time<br />\nwhen things can literally change<br />\novernight is taking a big risk.<br />\nOlstein was disappointed that<br />\nGovernor Mario Cuomo and<br />\nSenators Bill Bradley and Sam<br />\nNunn chose not to run in 1988.<br />\nRepublican supporters of<br />\nGovernor Pierre DuPont and<br />\nGeneral Alexander Haig\u2014<br />\ncandidates who have dropped out<br />\nof the race\u2014also expressed disappointment at the process and were<br />\nnot supporting candidates on<br />\nSuper Tuesday.<br />\nSupporters of Simon, who is<br />\nnot participating again until the Illinois primary, are sticking loyally by their candidate and staying<br />\naway from the primaries on<br />\nMarch 8.<br />\nOlstein and other students have<br />\nchosen to work for local<br />\nMaryland candidates. Olstein<br />\nhelped with the renomination<br />\ncampaigns of Congressman Ben<br />\nCardin and Senator Paul Sarbanes. Freshman Chris Culp and<br /><br />\n'expect more to come as November approaches'<br />\none who has \"done something. . .successfully. Dukakis<br />\nhas run Massachusetts government in an organized manner,<br />\nsomething which is needed at the<br />\nfederal level where there is<br />\nchaos.\" Derman also strongly<br />\nagrees with Dukakis's positions<br />\non education, taxes, and Israel.<br />\nFreshman Norvin Klontz supports Congressman Jack Kemp<br />\nbecause he believes \"Kemp is the<br />\nonly candidate qualified to do the<br />\njob.\" Klontz doesn't think Kemp<br /><br />\nsophomore Jim Knighton are<br />\nworking for a Baltimore public<br />\nrelations firm which specializes in<br />\nwork for political candidates.<br />\nAs for political activism after<br />\nSuper Tuesday, Olstein and<br />\nGregory Francis, presidents of<br />\nthe Young Democrats and College Republicans, respectively,<br />\nexpect their members to support<br />\nparty nominees.<br />\nSo while recent days have seen<br />\npolitical activism, expect more to<br />\ncome as November approaches.<br /><br />\n'AY TACK<br /><br />\nZippy!<br />\nThe 'strangest comic<br />\nstrip on the newspaper<br />\npage' and its stranger<br />\ncreator, Bill Griffith<br />\nby Cami Colarossi, Feature<br />\nEditor, Goucher College<br />\nQuindecim. Special to the<br />\nNews-Letter.<br />\nIf you don't look carefully, you<br />\njust might think that \"Zippy the<br />\nPinhead\" is a normal comic strip.<br />\nFar from it. According to Bill<br />\nGriffith, Zippy's creator, \"It's<br />\nthe strangest comic strip on the<br />\nnewspaper page.\"<br />\nWith his cone-shaped head, red<br /><br />\nand yellow polka-dotted tunic,<br />\nand five o'clock shadow, Zippy<br />\nepitomizes the underground comic character.

After creating<br />\nZippy in 1970, Griffith published the antics of his character in<br />\nunderground newspapers and<br />\npublications. Later, he brought<br />\nhis strip to the pages of National<br />\nLampoon, a move that he says<br />\nbridged the gap between<br />\nunderground and daily syndication. In 1986, the San Francisco<br />\nExaminer offered to publish a dai-<br /><br />\nly \"Zippy the Pinhead \u2014 strip.<br />\nGriffitht'created the original<br />\nZippy character for an<br />\nunderground comic-love story<br />\nparody called, \"I Fell in Love<br />\nwith a Pinhead, but He Made a<br />\nFool Out of Me.\" Pinheads, or<br />\nmicrocephalics, have fascinated<br />\nGriffith ever since he watched the<br />\n1932 movie, \"Freaks,\" which<br />\nstarred real circus side-show<br />\nfreaks. And after seeing a picture<br />\nof a P.T. Barnum circus pinhead<br /><br />\n\"Zip, the What-is-It,\" Griffith<br />\nnamed his character accordingly.<br />\nTo read \"Zippy\" is to experience the essence of weirdness. No subject bypasses him,<br />\ninlcuding politics (Zippy thinks<br />\nhe is the current U.S. President)<br />\nand male bonding (\"So,\" he asks<br />\nhis friends, \"when do we hit the<br />\nshowers?\"). Griffith explains that<br />\nsuch ideas come to him from his<br />\nSee ZIPPY, page 17<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER/17<br /><br />\nSt.PaulCleaners<br /><br />\nZippy the Pinhead<br /><br />\nTAILORING, REPAIRING SAME DAY CLEANING AND PRESSING, SHOE REPAIRING<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nZIPPY, from page 16<br />\n\"Zippy part of the brain,' when<br />\nthe analytical side of my brain has<br />\nnot clicked.\"<br />\nWhen creating his strips, Griffith admits it is difficult to be<br />\nfunny and address themes which<br />\nhe feels are important. \"In absurd, non-linear writing,\" he<br />\nsays, \"there needs to be a balance<br />\nbetween being true to the weirdness of character and making a<br />\npoint. Zippy may be a pinhead,<br />\nbut he is not pointless.\"<br />\nGriffith describes his audience<br />\nas \"bizarre, but intellectual,\" and<br />\nmostly college-age. Yet there is<br />\nno single description of his<br />\nreadership, which includes two<br />\n96-year old twins who regularly<br />\nsend fan letters, and a man who<br />\nlikes to mail junk-food wrappers.<br />\nNot everyone loves Zippy, and<br />\nthere is enough hate mail to prove<br />\nit. One reader in Denver insists<br />\nthat Zippy is \"a communist who<br />\nencourages masturbation.\" Griffith attributes such attitudes to<br />\npeople who read Zippy, do not<br />\nunderstand it, and consequently<br /><br />\nget angry. \"But,\" he says,<br />\n\"those adamantly anti-Zippy people become the strongest Zippy<br />\nfans.\"<br />\nWith Zippy, Griffith hopes to<br />\n:.-.fluence other cartoonists to<br /><br />\n\"Zippy may be a<br />\npinhead, but he is not<br />\npointless.\"<br /><br />\n\u2014Bill Griffith<br />\ncreate strips with more substance<br />\ninstead of only punch lines. \"Daily strips just sit there on the<br />\npage,\" he says. \"Unlike in the<br />\n'20s and '30s, people today expect very little of them.\"<br />\nUnderground comics like Weirdo, Raw, and Life in Hell are<br />\namong Griffith's favorite strips,<br />\nwhile he \"mildly likes\" The Far<br />\nSide, Calvin and Hobbes, and<br /><br />\nDoonesbury. Bloom County, probably the country's most popular<br />\nstrip, especially among collegeaged readers, is Griffith's personal anathema. \"I know,<br />\neverybody likes Bloom County,<br />\nbut I just don't. It's too white<br />\nbread, too cutesy, and too pleasant.\"<br />\nGriffith plans to take Zippy as<br />\nfar as he can. Currently, Zippy's<br />\nfirst movie, Zippyvision, written<br />\nby Griffith and his wife Diane<br />\nNoomin and starring Randy<br />\nQuaid, is being filmed. Also,<br />\nKing Pin, a collection of new Zippy strips, is out on the book<br />\nstands.

Sure,<br />\nI'm a well-known Divine fan<br />\n(you've seen the guy with all the<br />\nflamingos around campus? That's<br />\nme), but ask anyone who has seen<br />\none of Divine's performances,<br />\nanyone at all, and they'll tell you<br />\nthat they'll never forget it. It's effected them, and more, it's<br />\nbroadened them, for better or<br />\nworse. One way or the other,<br />\npeople who have seen Divine on<br />\nscreen have a steadfast opinion of<br />\nthe man; an opinion that they will<br />\ndefend violently.<br />\nFor the past five years, all I've<br />\never said to prove Divine's effectiveness is to tell people to see the<br />\nmovies for themselves. Pink<br />\nFlamingos, Female Trouble,<br />\nPolyester, (in glorious Odorama,<br />\nno less), Lust in the Dust, Trouble in Mind. Hairspray (Divine's<br />\nlatest and last role), is playing at<br />\nthe Senator Theater on York<br /><br />\nRoad, right now.

Each and<br />\nevery piece that dealt with his captured forever on film. The<br />\ndeath referred to him by his real enormous shape. The distinctive<br />\nname (which he hated), called throaty voice. The bizarre makehim a \"Transvestite actor\" up and wild hair. The comic<br />\n(which he hated), and reported genius. He's been called many<br />\nthat he only played one male role things, from The Prettiest<br />\nin his career (which was simply Woman in the World, to The<br />\nFilthiest Person Alive, to A<br />\nwrong).<br />\nDivine was an actor.

Where<br />\nthese people are getting their impressions is beyond me, because<br />\nif they've been frequenting such<br />\nplaces as Max's on Broadway<br />\nand the 8x10, they should've<br />\ncome across such local faves as<br />\nRed Tape and When Thunder<br />\nComes.<br />\nBoth these groups have enough<br />\nof a local base, in fact, to have<br />\nput out some vinyl on Frantic<br />\nRecords, an indie label run out of<br />\nThe Commercial Refinery, a<br />\nrecording studio located at 2105<br />\nMaryland Avenue, a scant four<br />\nblocks from your faithful critic's<br />\nhome. Red Tape's first album is<br />\nsimple called Red Tape, while<br />\nWhen Tunder Comes' most recent album is entitled Eves ofthe<br />\nWolf. (WTC also released two<br />\nalbums under the name The Mission, which must have resulted in<br />\nsome legal problems with the<br />\nBritish group of the same name.)<br />\nWhen Thunder Comes sounds<br />\na lot like Bauhaus on a first listen,<br />\nprimarily because of the Peter<br />\nMurphy-isms of frontman David<br />\nJ. Cawkwell (which, unfortunately, are destined to get them written off as Bauhaus imitators).<br />\nUpon repeated spins, however, it<br />\nbecomes quickly apparent that<br />\nthere are some significantly dif-<br /><br />\nferent things going on. WTC has \"Urban Sub-Urban\" with its<br />\ndispensed with Bauhaus' acoustic clean, crisp rhythm section<br />\ntendencies, and gone for an (which often sounds mushy or a<br />\nAmerican-style guitar attack bit over-done on some of the<br />\nbacked up with keyboards. The other cuts), and its fuzzy, slightresult is at times as dark as ly psychedelic guitar.<br />\nBauhaus (\"Urban Sub-Urban,\"<br />\nIn all, this album shows a<br />\n\"Nickels and Dimes\"), while group that's looking around for<br />\nstill being poppy enough (\"She's their musical niche. It also shows<br />\nan Elevator,\" \"Cause Last enough direction, however, to<br />\nNight\") to put you in mind of a assure me that they'll find it soon,<br />\nband that could easily get away and it's got enough mean hooks<br />\nwith playing in almost any decent and plain ol' musical saavy to<br />\nbar. This versatility of style is guarantee them some real attensomething of a survival instinct, tion when they do find it.<br />\nI've been trying to think of a<br />\nsince these guys do literally sing<br />\nfor their supper. It is also an ad- way to describe Red Tape's<br />\nmirable skill that assures the band sound, and I'm not sure I can<br />\nwill never go stale in their chosen quite do it. Imagine the vocal and<br />\nstyle. Their style, however, rhythm style of lOCC, or such<br />\nseems to change with each song, late '70s California Sound groups<br />\nand it is these incongruities of as The Long Run era Eagles. Add<br />\nsound that disturbed me most keyboards and studio processing<br />\nabout this album. The use of reminiscent of Gary Numan. I'm<br />\nbagpipes and marching snare on not sure what it all equals\u2014I find<br />\nthe end of\"Something Real,\" for myself almost forced to make a<br />\nexample, seemed completely out comparison to Steely Dan, yet<br />\nof place with the rest of the song, Red Tape manages to skirt the<br />\nif not the entire sound of the rest overly-slick, sterile, and,(to me<br />\nof the album. Similarly, the latin- at least) reluctantly boring sound<br />\nstyle vibes on \"Into the Light\" of Steely Dan through some of the<br />\nseem completely out of place in most beautiful songwriting I've<br />\ncomparison to the fuzzy wah-wah heard in a long time. If Steely<br />\nguitar and heavy tom-tom attack Dan had just one song like<br />\nof \"Nickels and Dimes,\" which ''Passenger,\" I could probably<br />\nprecedes it. Experimentation with be converted to their legions of<br />\ndifferent sounds is a great idea, fans.

Doctors Lee Randol Barker and<br />\nDavid Evans Kern think that they<br />\nhave solved this problem. Barker<br />\nand Kern conduct a month-long<br />\nprogram for medical residents in<br />\ninternal medicine, teaching doctors the proper way to deal with<br />\npatients of all kinds. As part of<br />\nthe Wednesday Noon Series, Drs.<br />\nBarker and Kern, co-directors of<br />\nthe Division of General Internal<br />\nMedicine at the Francis Scott Key<br />\nMedical Center and faculty<br />\nmembers at the Johns Hopkins<br />\nSchool of Medicine, discussed<br />\n\"Teaching doctors to communicate with patients.\"<br />\nDr. Barker first asked the audience to express the problems<br />\nthey encountered at the physi-<br /><br />\ncian's office. Most of the<br />\nresponses seemed to indicate a<br />\npublic unsatisfied with their doctor visits, and most complaints<br />\nwere legitimate, according to<br />\nBarker. People complained that<br />\nthe visits were often rushed and<br />\nsometimes interrupted by phone<br />\ncalls or other distractions. The<br />\ndoctor would often either explain<br />\nthe patient's condition in medical<br />\nterms too complex for the patient,<br />\nor would oversimplify the condition. Barker and Kern condensed the most common complaints<br />\ninto six categories. They are the<br />\nphysician's failure to:<br />\n\u2014Listen<br />\n\u2014Clarify patient's problems<br />\n\u2014Respond to concerns and<br />\npsychological needs<br />\n\u2014Educate and motivate<br />\n\u2014Get the most out of available<br />\ntime<br />\nTo illustrate the difference a<br />\nfew behavioral changes can make<br />\non the doctor-patient relationship,<br />\nDrs. Barker and Kern showed a<br />\nvideotape, simulating a particularly hard subject to deal with:<br />\ninforming a patient that she has<br />\ncancer. After having a polyp<br />\nremoved from her colon, the pa-<br /><br />\ntient returns to the physician's office to learn the results of the<br />\ntissue biopsy. The first doctor is<br />\nsensitive and has a gentle voice,<br />\nbut when the patient becomes<br />\nupset, he continues to describe<br />\nthe medical explanation. Dr.<br />\nKern emphasized that when a patient is upset, they often will not<br />\neven hear what the physician is<br />\nsaying. Furthermore, the doctor<br />\nhas already made plans for the patient' surgery. According to<br />\nthe input of the patient is<br />\nKern,<br />\n_<br />\nessential to help alleviate his or<br />\nher anxiety.<br />\nBy contrast, the second doctor<br />\nseems to hold a conversation with<br />\nthe patient, as opposed to the first<br />\ndoctor's monologue. He is not<br />\nafraid to use the word cancer in<br />\ndiscussing the condition. When<br />\nthe patient becomes upset, he<br />\ncomforts her, and gives her time<br />\nto ask questions. The patient is<br />\npermitted to arrange her own<br />\nsurgery time, etc. This gives the<br />\npatient more control over her<br />\nsituation. These changes in<br />\nbehavior between the two doctors<br />\nseems to be minor, but in<br />\ntraumatic times, every little thing<br />\nmakes the difference.<br /><br />\nDrs. Barker and Kern also<br />\ndiscussed the importance of<br />\nand<br />\nbiomedical<br />\ntreating<br />\nsymptoms<br />\npsychological<br />\ntogether. Quite often, says Kern,<br />\ndoctors separate the two.<br />\nHowever, psychological symptoms sometimes manifest<br />\nthemselves in physical conditions. For example, fatigue, lack<br />\nof sleep, and lack of hunger are<br />\nsometimes indicative of depression. A person who has an<br />\nunderlying mental illness usually visits his general physician<br />\nbefore a specialist. Therefore,<br />\nDr. Kern says that doctors should<br />\nbe especially careful in their<br />\nobservations of their patients'<br />\nemotional state.<br />\nHow are physicians taught<br />\nthese interpersonal skills? In their<br />\nprogram, Drs. Barker and Kern<br />\nuse a variety of methods. The<br />\nfirst is role playing between the<br />\nteaching physician and the<br />\nmedical resident. The doctors<br />\ngave an example of role playing<br />\nby acting out the same scenario<br />\nseen on the videotape. Dr. Kern<br />\ncalls the role playing \"active<br />\nlearning\u2014learning by practice,<br />\nnot by lecture or by watching<br /><br />\nother physicians.\" Another advantage of role playing is that<br />\nresidents can test out different<br />\nresponses in a \"safe situation.\"<br />\nThey can call time out and start<br />\nover at any time. Other methods<br />\nthat Barker and Kern use are<br />\nsimulated patients, people who<br />\nare paid to act out certain<br />\nscenarios, residents are exposed<br />\nto alcoholism, marital problems,<br />\nand hypochondriacs. Through<br />\nvideo review, the resident can see<br />\nhimself in action and discuss problems with his peers. Finally, by<br />\nactually observing in person other<br />\nphysicians' relationships with<br />\ntheir patients, the resident sees<br />\nthe skills \"integrated into a real<br />\ntime frame,\" as opposed to the<br />\n\"safe situations\" that are part of<br />\nthe other techniques.<br />\nA poor patient-doctor relationship can have sever consequences, says Dr. Kern. They include inaccurate diagnosis, an<br />\nunhappy patient, misuse of<br />\ntherapy by a patient, and<br />\nultimately malpractice suits. In<br />\nlight of such serious results, Dr.<br />\nKern wonders why more time is<br />\nnot spent teaching medical<br />\nstudents these important skills.<br /><br />\nSpring Cleaning: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust<br />\nby Denise A. Ross<br />\nHumans shed about 1.5 grams<br />\nof skin every day. Most of this<br />\n,skin becomes dust atop furniture<br />\nand floors. Should you doubt this,<br />\ngather some dust and burn it. It<br />\nwill smell like singed skin.<br />\nThe idea that most of your<br />\n\"house dust\" is really \"people<br />\ndust\" makes the thought of even<br />\nwalking across your floor, not to<br />\nmention placing cooking utensils<br />\non the counter, rather repulsive.<br />\nEvery person who has set foot in<br />\nyour home has left a small<br />\nmoment() for you to treasure,<br />\ntread on, or inhale, as the case<br />\nmay be. Not a pleasant thought.<br />\nThe ideal situation would be to<br />\nbring a halt to dividing skin cells.<br />\nUnfortunately, this is not possible while we are still alive. Skin<br />\ngrows and renews itself at all<br />\ntimes. One of its most important<br />\nfunctions is to produce the dead<br />\nhorny layer of keratin which protects the organism from the<br />\nenvironment.<br />\nThe outer layer of skin is called the epidermis. It can be<br />\nseparated into several layers.<br />\nFrom the bottom to the top they<br />\nare: the basal layer, the spiny<br />\nlayer, the granular layer, and the<br />\nhorny layer.<br />\nIn human epidermis, the cells<br />\nof the basal layer are usually<br />\nsomewhat cubic in shape. This<br />\nlayer produces all the cells in the<br />\nepidermis.<br />\nThe cells of the basal layer<br />\ndivide by a process known as<br />\nmitosis. When the cells divide,<br />\nthey begin to move up into the<br />\nnext layer of the epidermis, the<br />\nspiny layer. As the cells ascend,<br />\nthey change shape. The cells of<br />\nthe spiny layer are polyhedral and<br />\nbecome increasingly flattened as<br />\nthey are squeezed into the<br />\ngranular layer.<br />\nThe cells of the granular layer<br />\nae characterized by granules of<br />\nprotein called keratin. These cells<br /><br />\ndo not divide. Instead, they begin<br />\nto change shape into the outer<br />\nskin cells which are called<br />\nkeratinocytes. As the cells of the<br />\ngranular layer age and migrate<br />\noutward, the keratin granules<br />\nbecome more prominent. The<br />\npressure from the dividing cells<br />\nbelow causes the cells to become<br />\nflattened sacs of keratin protein<br />\nknown as the horny layer.<br />\nFrom the day you are born, the<br />\ndead cells of the horny layer are<br />\nshed and replaced by new cells<br />\ncoming up from the granular<br />\nlayer. In adult skin, a cell born<br />\nin the basal layer takes approximately two weeks to reach the<br />\nhorny layer.<br />\nIt is generally agreed that cell<br />\ndivision in the epidermis occurs<br />\nchiefly in the basal layer.<br />\nHowever, there has been some<br />\ndisagreement about this. The<br />\nfollowing experiment illustrates<br />\nthat most of the epidermis'<br />\n\u2022mitotic activity does take place in<br />\nthe basal layer.<br />\nIn this experiment, a single<br />\nlayer of horny cells is removed by<br />\napplying a piece of scotch tape to<br />\na subject's arm and quickly pulling it off. Under the microscope<br />\nyou can see a single layer of<br />\nkeratinized cells adhering to the<br />\nsticky surface. Repeat the process<br />\nover the same area of skin until<br />\nthe surface becomes red and<br />\nshiny but remains dry. Stain each<br />\nsection and make counts of<br />\ndividing cells, mitotic counts.<br />\nA complete stripping of the<br />\nhorny layer is accompanied by<br />\nsome cell damage, hyperemia<br />\n(excesses of blood in the body<br />\npart), and mild inflammation of<br />\nthe layer under the epidermis, the<br />\ndermis. This could cause mitotic<br />\nactivity. However, the loss of less<br />\nskin can lead to appreciable<br />\nmitotic activity without the above<br />\ndamage.<br />\nApproximately half of the mitotic counts occur in the basal<br /><br />\nlayer. The other half occur in the<br />\nspiny layer. Only a few mitotic<br />\ncounts are said to occur in the<br />\nhigher layers of the spiny layer.<br />\nTo appreciate the significance<br />\nof this observation, the change<br />\nwhich occurs in the epidermis<br />\nafter the tape treatment is observed. During the first 72 hours, the<br />\nbasal cells increase the space they<br />\noccupy while their numbers are<br /><br />\ndecreasing. However, they continue to divide at the same rate as<br />\nbefore. A large percentage of the<br />\nmitotic counts attributed to the<br />\nspiny layer are really basal cells<br />\nwhich have been crowded out of<br />\nspace.<br />\nMost tissues have an intrinsic<br />\npotential for cell division which<br />\nis related to the normal loss of<br />\ncells. It is possible that the rate<br /><br />\nof loss itself may to some extent<br />\nbe dependent upon the rate of<br />\nproduction. No one is quite sure<br />\nwhat the case is, or how we can<br />\nstop ourselves from slowly<br />\nchanging into dust. Until it is<br />\nfigured out, maybe it's time to<br />\nbreak out those vacuum cleaners<br />\nand do your spring cleaning a little early.<br /><br />\nHopkins Science Beat<br />\nBecoming a Doctor<br />\nThe \"Hospital as a Human Institution\" will again be presenting<br />\na lecture for the JHMI humanities<br />\nseries.

The Jays then took the<br />\nlead for the only time of the afternoon at 1:58 in the first quarter,<br />\nwhen Jeff Ihm connected on an<br />\nassist from John Cicarone. The<br />\nOrangemen then made it 3-2, but<br />\nBlue Jay midfielder Brendan Kelly tied things up with 5:10 remaining in the period.

As if that's<br />\nnot bad enough, last Saturday the<br />\nShoremen traveled to Chapel Hill<br />\nto face the mighty Tar Heels.<br />\nThis Saturday they play host to<br />\nthe defending national champion<br />\nJohns Hopkins Blue Jays and then<br />\nturn around to face Navy in Annapolis only four days later. The<br />\nfollowing Sunday they must face<br />\nGuilford, currently one of the top<br />\nranked teams in Division III. In<br />\nall, Washington plays 16 games<br />\nthis season, including three<br />\ngames against teams ranked in the<br />\ntop ten in Division I and matchups against traditional Division III<br />\npowers such as Hobart and West<br />\nChester.<br />\nWell,<br />\ncrazy?<br />\nSound<br />\nWashington plays a schedule like<br />\nthis every year, and every year<br />\nthey finish among the top three or<br />\nfour teams in Division III. Last<br />\nseason, the Shoremen finished<br /><br />\n10-7 and ranked third in the final<br />\nDivision III Coaches' Poll. Of the<br />\nseven losses, four were to Division I teams and one was to<br />\nHobart. Furthermore, Washington proved that they can<br />\nplay with the big boys, as they put<br />\nscares into Duke and Navy before<br />\nfalling 9-6 in both games.<br />\nWith the lineup and firepower<br />\nthey have this season, the<br />\nShoremen are going to scare a lot<br />\nof people. Coach Terry Corcoron<br />\nreturns 9 starters from last year's<br />\nteam, including two Division III<br />\nAll-Americans. Washington is<br />\nespecially strong on attack, where<br />\nlast year's leading scorer Tim<br />\nHormes (40 goals and 5 assists)<br />\nleads a group of seasoned<br />\nveterans. Hormes, a sophomore,<br />\nscored 7 goals in the season<br />\nopener against Lynchburg and<br />\nchalked up a goal arri an assist in<br />\nthe 17-5 loss at Chapel Hill. Also<br />\nback are seniors Paul Deniken<br />\nand Paul Miller, who combined<br />\nfor 29 goals and 9 assists last<br />\nseason. Deniken has been<br />\nawesome in the early season,<br />\nscoring 6 goals in the 28-4 victory over Lynchburg and two<br />\ngoals against Carolina. Miller had<br />\nfour goals and 6 assists in the first<br /><br />\ntwo games. They will be joined<br />\nby juniors Walt Spence and Matt<br />\nKelly, freshmen Ben Lamana and<br />\nRon Council, and sophomore<br />\nMark Cavallaro. Washington also<br />\nboasts a solid mid-field, where<br />\nthey return three seniors. Mike<br />\nMcGuane racked up 43 points last<br />\nseason on 27 goals and 16 assists,<br />\nand appears headed in the same<br />\ndirection thus far this season.<br />\nMike scored five goals and had<br />\nthree assists in the season opener.<br />\nChris Dollar was second only to<br />\nHormes in goals last season, as he<br />\nput the ball past the goalie 28<br />\ntimes. Mike Wookfolk has<br />\nalready started to produce this<br />\nseason, scoring four goals and<br />\nassisting on two others in the first<br />\ntwo games.<br />\nThe Shoremen's most obvious<br />\nweakness is defense, although<br />\nthis year's squad is the most experienced in recent memory.<br />\nMatt Wilson, Terry Reynolds,<br />\nBrian Kelleher, Jim Houtenbrink,<br />\nand Pat Youngs are all seasoned<br />\nveterans, but they'll have to be<br />\nsharp in the first few games as the<br />\nShoremen break in their new<br />\ngoalie.
