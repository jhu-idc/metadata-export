Other men may report during the course of the<br />\nweek, but those who have definitely decided to come out for the<br />\nteam are as follows: Leadbetter,<br />\nMicklethwait, Martindale, Tillet,<br />\nOrmond, Finney, Jackson, Hartman, Stackford and Callender.<br />\nJackson, Hartman, Martindale<br />\nand Finney have all been members of other Hopkins teams. Callender was a sub-quarter at Harvard. Tillet was on a University of Georgia team, and was<br />\nchosen all-Southern quarterback.<br />\nNot a man on the list is not an<br />\nexperienced player or one whose<br />\npresence will not make a decided<br />\naddition to the Hopkins squad.<br />\nIn addition, the majority of these<br />\nmen are linesmen, who,at present,<br />\nare regarded as constituting the<br />\nBlack and Blue's greatest need.<br />\nThroughout the season, efforts<br />\nhave been constantly made to induce some or all of these men to<br />\nreport for practice, but until last<br />\nSaturday these efforts were unavailing. At the meeting Saturday morning, however, Drs. Bridgman, Stone and Bernheim made<br />\npersonal appeals to the men to<br />\nlend their efforts to the development of another championship<br />\neleven\u2014with the above list of recruits as a result.<br />\nThe reluctance of the men to<br />\npractice with the team heretofore<br />\nhas been due entirely to the<br />\namount of work which study at the<br />\nHopkins Medical School entails.<br />\nThe hours run practically from<br />\nnine to five every day, and, in the<br />\nlater years, often longer.<br />\nThe Athletic Association is endeavoring to procure enough autos<br />\nto call for the men every day, so<br />\nas to bring them to Homewood<br />\nField in the quickest possible<br />\ntime after they are released from<br />\nthe laboratory. It is extremely<br />\nimprobable, however, that, even<br />\nwith this convenience, the whole<br />\nsquad can go into action soon<br />\nenough to obtain much daylight<br />\nscrimmage.<br />\n<br />\nAt a meeting of the Senior<br />\nClass, held last Friday, Prof. Carl<br />\nC. Thomas, professor of mechanical engineering and head of the<br />\nHopkins Mechanical Engineering<br />\nSchool, was elected honorary class<br />\npresident.<br />\nProfessor Thomas, who has the<br />\nhonor -of being the first man from<br />\nthe Engineering School to be<br />\nchosen honorary president of a<br />\ngraduating class, has won a nation-wide reputation by his work.<br />\nHe has been connected with three<br />\nother universities besides Hopkins\u2014Cornell, New York and<br />\nWisconsin. At the first of these<br />\nhe was professor of marine engineering and naval architecture;<br />\nat the second, professor of marine<br />\nengineering; and at the third, professor of steam and gas engineering.<br />\nThe election of the honorary<br />\npresident was the first business<br />\nof the day. .After it was concluded, President Sutton announced that another member was<br />\nto be elected to the Student Council. Henry Baker, of the Engineering School, was chosen to.this<br />\nposition.<br />\nSutton next announced that, to<br />\nfollow up the way blazed by the<br />\nJunior Class, a committee of ten<br />\nhad been appointed to arouse the<br />\nclass' spirit in support of the<br />\nfootball team. The committee<br />\nconsisted of Howard Wilson,<br />\nchairman; Firor, Hobleman,<br />\nSkinner Steinbach, Twigg, Cecil,<br />\nE. G. Hall, E. L. Smith and<br />\nWatson.<br />\nHenry Straus, editor-in-chief<br />\nof the 1917 Hullabaloo, then addressed the meeting, explaining<br />\nthe change of purpose which the<br />\neditors had determined upon for<br />\nthe book, and asking the support<br />\nof all for the benefit to be given<br />\non November 24. He was followed by W. B. Baxley, who exhorted the class to support the<br />\nmilitary training movement, not<br />\nonly in principle, but in actual<br />\nreport at the drills. \u2022<br />\n<br />\nIn a game that will go down<br />\nin the annals of history as being<br />\none of the most spirited contests<br />\never witnessed on Homewood<br />\nfield, Hopkins 'vasity eleven was<br />\ndefeated by Swarthmore on Saturday, 14 to 6.<br />\nSeldom has a Black and Blue<br />\neleven played with more fight and<br />\ndetermination. Outweighed and<br />\nplaying against a more experienced team, Hopkins held the visitors to two touchdowns, which<br />\nwere scored by Swarthmore during the first 10 minutes of play.<br />\nThereafter, especially during the<br />\nsecond half, Hopkins kept the ball<br />\nin the visitors' territory and prevented further scoring by the<br />\nQuakers by fighting against a superior team with apparently exhaustless spirit and energy. Their<br />\nreward, and what might be termed<br />\nthe climax of their endeavors,<br />\ncanVe during the last three minutes of play, when Hopkins, after<br />\nrecovering the ball on a fumble<br />\nmade by Swarthmore, scored a<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nThe day was by no means ideal<br />\nfor a football contest. On the<br />\nother hand, a drizzling rain kept<br />\nthe field and ball very slippery,<br />\nand frequent fumbles by both<br />\nteams was the result. The bad<br />\nweather conditions kept most of<br />\nthe indifferent class of spectators<br />\nindoors, but Hopkins' rooters<br />\nturned out in force and added to<br />\nthe enthusiasm and spirit of the<br />\naffair.<br />\nThe cheering and singing by the<br />\nrooting section was carried on in<br />\na highly commendable manner.<br />\nIt was clearly evident that the<br />\nyell practices of the past week<br />\nhad done a world of good. The<br />\ncheering heretofore has been of a<br />\nvery mediocre character, but last<br />\nSaturday the Black and Blue<br />\nrooting section really got behind<br />\nthe team, and 'despite the weather<br />\nconditions, the cheers did not lag<br />\nas formerly.<br />\nHowever, the stands had good<br />\ncause to show their confidence in<br />\nthe Black and Blue eleven. The<br />\nlatter part of the second half was<br />\nabout as thrilling as any ever<br />\nstaged<br />\non<br />\nHomewood<br />\nfield.<br />\nSwarthmore had two touchdowns<br />\nto her credit, but try as they<br />\nmight every time they started a<br />\nrally a fumble would intervene<br />\nand a Hopkins man would snatch<br />\nthe ball. Hopkins thus had<br />\nseveral chances to score, but<br />\nmissed by inches completing one<br />\n<br />\nBy COACH BRENNICK<br />\n<br />\nOn Saturday the team won the<br />\npraise of the student body, the<br />\nalumni, friends, and of the<br />\ncoaches\u2014and this notwithstanding the fact that they lost\u2014because they played a fighting, spirited and intelligent game, such as<br />\nbefitted a Hopkins team. In<br />\nSwarthmore they met one of the<br />\nbest teams in the East, fresh from<br />\nits victory over Pennsylvania, so<br />\nthat, playing as our team did, the<br />\ncontest was a splendid one from<br />\nbeginning to end. Our line again<br />\ndistinguished itself, but the backfield came into its own also on<br />\nSaturday, and gives promise of<br />\nmuch greater development. Branham and Hopkins played great<br />\nfootball, both on offense and defense, and showed they were able<br />\nto stand up under heavy strain.<br />\nCalkins, a freshman, showed the<br />\ncoaches that he has the makings<br />\nof a fine player, if the improvement he exhibited on Saturday is<br />\ncontinued. Every man that entered the contest showed that he<br />\nhad fight and spirit, and even if<br />\nnothing else but these features<br />\nwere shown, the team deserved the<br />\ncongratulations given \u2022 them by<br />\ntheir fellow-students after the<br />\ngame.<br />\nBut fight and spirit alone do<br />\nnot win football games. Indeed,<br />\nis it not the fact that the defeated<br />\nteam often shows more spirit and<br />\nfight than the winner? What we<br />\nmust have is an efficient team, a<br />\nteam that can do the purely physical work in a more or less subconscious way while using their<br />\nbrains to adjust themselves to the<br />\nvarious conditions which may confront them during a contest. The<br />\nfirst signs of this kind of a team<br />\npresented themselves Saturday,<br />\nand it was this aspect of the case<br />\nwhich was most pleasing to the<br />\ncoaches and those who are closely<br />\nwatching the team's development.<br />\nThe past three games have<br />\nplainly indicated that, game and<br />\nspirited as our line is, it must be<br />\nstrengthened if we are to successfully cope with future opponents.<br />\nThe present line plays a splendid<br />\ndefensive game, but when it comes<br />\nto lifting, on the offense, the<br />\nstrength is wanting. This does<br />\nnot mean that the present line is<br />\nto be discarded; far from it. It<br />\ncontains too many splendid players; men who would be an addition to any team. They are fine<br />\nmen for part of a game, but not<br />\n(Continued on page 12, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nThe enrollment at Wellesley for<br />\nthe present college year is about<br />\n1,575, with a freshman class of<br />\n510.\u2014Ex.<br />\n<br />\nImprovements, the total cost of<br />\nwhich will reach $150,000 or $200,000, have been under way since<br />\nearly last summer at Delaware<br />\nCollege.

An envelope containing<br />\ntwelve slips, each slip having<br />\nupon it some argument in favor<br />\nof life insurance, was given to<br />\nevery member of the class, and<br />\nthe men were instructed to arrange and number the slips in accordance with the relative appeal<br />\nwhich they presented.<br />\nThe twelve arguments submitted covered a wide field, ranging<br />\nfrom general statistical facts to<br />\ninvocations of sentiments entirely<br />\npersonal. There were cold, hard<br />\nreferences to the irrefutable proposition that all men are human,<br />\ntempting statements of the especial advantages which a life insurance policy offered as a form<br />\nof investment, touching pictures<br />\nof the pride and joy with which<br />\nan employer would call to his<br />\narms the far-seeing employee who<br />\nwould flaunt before his eyes the<br />\nreceipt for his first premium.

Many seniors,<br />\nsophomores and freshmen, as they<br />\ncame into the door of the lectureroom of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, casually wondered what<br />\nhad caused the enormous increase<br />\nin attendance which met their<br />\neyes. As the crowd swelled larger<br />\nand larger, that wonder grew with<br />\nit\u2014among all, except the juniors.<br />\nTwo or three yells were given, and<br />\nthen there arose a shout of \"18<br />\nthis way,\" and there was what<br />\nseemed to be a general migration<br />\nto the corner of the room where<br />\nBob Duncan was perched on a<br />\nconvenient window sill.<br />\nThe rest of the men were impatiently awaiting an explanation<br />\nof these unexpected proceedings<br />\n\u2014and Duncan gave it, in a short<br />\nspeech entirely devoid of any attempt at inspiring rhetoric, but<br />\nwhich simply stated a fact. The<br />\ncheering and the support of the<br />\nfootball team in general had been<br />\nunmitigatedly rotten, he said;<br />\nsomething had to be done\u2014and<br />\nthe, juniors proposed doing it.<br />\nThey were going to form a separate organization, stick together<br />\nat yell practices, and come out in<br />\na body to watch the team scrimmage. Above everything, every<br />\nman in the class was to be part<br />\nof the unit. That was all.<br />\nOf course, that was not all. It<br />\nwas not all at that cheering practice itself, the enthusiasm of<br />\nwhich showed to the Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen a side of their University as yet unknown; nor was it<br />\nall when the football team last<br />\nFriday afternoon went through<br />\ntheir final evolutions before a<br />\ngrandstand which had as many<br />\nwildly rooting men in it as had<br />\nthe entire cheering section at any<br />\nof the preceding games.

As each company came<br />\nwithin a few paces of him the<br />\ncommand \"eyes right\" was given,<br />\nand in two straight lines the company marched past. After a few<br />\nmore commands were executed in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nbattalion formations, the companies were turned over to their<br />\nrespective captains.<br />\nThe progress at drills is so<br />\nFIFTEEN CENTS<br />\nrapid that Lieutenant Elliott has<br />\nbeen able to cover about half of<br />\nthe movements in close order<br />\ncompany drill. One reason for<br />\nthis progress is that the commands -and movements are discussed before the drills by Lieutenant Elliott in his lectures. In<br />\nthis way every man learns what<br />\nhe has to do, and. no time is lost<br />\nat drills in explanations.<br />\nA few changes have been made<br />\nin the companies.

And yet Hopkins<br />\nheld Swarthmore to two touchdowns, both made in the first half.<br />\nOutweighed, playing against a<br />\nfrankly superior team, Hopkins<br />\ngritted its teeth and fought\u2014and<br />\nfought so well that the struggle<br />\nbecame equal.<br />\nThe team has found itself; the<br />\nUniversity is lined up behind it;<br />\nall Hopkins is in fighting trim.<br />\nWhether we win the championship or lose it, there could have<br />\nbeen no better prelude to the first<br />\nreal struggle for its possession<br />\nthan last Saturday's defeat.<br />\nAn Inadvisable Change.<br />\n<br />\nSince its first publication, the<br />\nHullabaloo has been the book of<br />\none class. In it each successive<br />\ngroup of graduates has found its<br />\nexpression; consciously or unconsciously, it has depicted the Hopkins senior. For that reason, the<br />\nbook has meant something\u2014has<br />\n<br />\nbeen more than a mere publication. It has belonged to the<br />\nseniors; they have felt that it has<br />\nbelonged to them, and they have<br />\nmade it worthy.<br />\nYet, although the Hullabaloos<br />\nof the past have been pre-eminently class books, every under-graduate institution and interest has<br />\nhad representation in their pages,<br />\nevery under-graduate class has<br />\nhad its own separate section\u2014<br />\nwith the proportion always maintained. A change in Hullabaloo<br />\npolicy can mean only one thing\u2014<br />\nthat proportion is to be destroyed; with the exception of the<br />\nphotographs and write-ups of the<br />\ngraduates, the Hullabaloo of the<br />\nfuture is not to be a senior book.<br />\nHopkins does not need an under-graduate annal. As a matter<br />\nof fact, it does not want an under-graduate annal. The Hullabaloo should be supported by<br />\nevery under-classman, but it<br />\nshould be supported because it is<br />\na Hopkins institution, not because<br />\nthat under-classman happens to<br />\nhave a photograph displayed on<br />\none of its pages.<br />\nIn the Hullabaloos of the past,<br />\nthe seniors have been given that<br />\npeculiar sense of individual possession that comes to men when<br />\nthey feel that a thing has grown<br />\nup in their own image. The Hullabaloo, as a class book, has been<br />\na personal bond between those,<br />\nwho, for four years, have worked<br />\nand lived together, a bond that an<br />\nunder-graduate annal could never<br />\nbe. The Hullabaloo has belonged<br />\nto the seniors\u2014and it has belonged to them of right.<br />\nThis is not the narrower policy;<br />\nit is the broader one. Breadth of<br />\nvision does not necessarily go<br />\nwith mere expanse of canvas.<br />\nAnd, because it has been the book<br />\nof one class and one class alone,<br />\nthe Hullabaloo of the past has reflected its University in the only<br />\nway that a University can be reflected in printed pages\u2014in the<br />\ntone in which those pages are conceived.<br />\nTIIE NEWS-LETTER has the greatest respect for the opinions of the<br />\nmembers of the 1917 Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard, but if feels constrained to<br />\nstate that it believes the change<br />\nwhich that board has announced<br />\nin the nature of the Hullabaloo<br />\nto be an inadvisable one.<br />\n<br />\nit had not passed irredeemably<br />\ninto the limbo of the departed, it<br />\nwas last Wednesday. That sign<br />\nwas given, given at what we devoutly hope was the end of the<br />\nmost dreary, listless, and enervating series of yell practices<br />\n(Heaven save the mark!) which<br />\nhas ever disgraced our University.<br />\nJust what the juniors did, and<br />\nhow they did it, is known to every<br />\nHopkins man. Just what results<br />\ntheir action will have, or rather,<br />\nhow long the results will last, is<br />\nknown to no one. But the great<br />\nmerit of the \"Pep\" Committee<br />\nwhich they appointed consists in<br />\nthe very fact of its appointment;<br />\nit shows that one class, at least,<br />\nhas still enough fire, enough backbone, enough vision, to start something\u2014and, in its history, Hopkins was never in more patent<br />\nneed for something to be started.<br />\nThe action which created the<br />\ncommittee has been followed up<br />\nby the men responsible for it, and<br />\nfollowed up with an enthusiasm<br />\nto which the last two yell practices bear ample witness. The<br />\nmovement to which it has given<br />\nrise may eliminate a few rather<br />\ntough problems, or it may only<br />\nprecipitate them, but on one point<br />\nthe University is united-1918 is<br />\ndistinctly a class.<br />\nThe Battalion.<br />\n<br />\nThat the inauguration of military training has met with the approval of the Hopkins student<br />\nbody, and that the battalion itself is in a highly satisfactory<br />\nstate of development, the drills on<br />\nthe campus are evidencing without a shadow of doubt.

JOHN H. LATANE'<br />\n<br />\nis hard for those of us who<br />\nwere here in the nineties to realize that to the students now in<br />\nresidence, and even to some members of the faculty, Herbert B.<br />\nAdams is merely a name. To us<br />\nhe is still a very real personality.<br />\nWe remember him as the embodiment of energy and initiative, influential in all University affairs<br />\nand actively interested in those<br />\nmatters which touched the life of<br />\nthe community, for he believed<br />\nwith Jules Siegfried that the<br />\n\"education of the people is the<br />\nfirst duty of democracy.\"<br />\nAdams was a native of Massachusetts, and came of old New<br />\nEngland stock. After graduating<br />\nfrom Amherst College and teaching Latin, Greek, mathematics<br />\nand classical history at Williston<br />\nSeminary for a year, he went to<br />\nGermany, and in 1870 received<br />\nthe degree of doctor of philosophy<br />\nat Heidelberg. That very year<br />\nthe - Johns Hopkins University<br />\nopened its doors to students, offering opportunities for investigation and research which had<br />\nnever before been available in<br />\nAmerica. Adams at once applied<br />\nfor and was awarded a fellowship<br />\nand was thus the first appointee<br />\nto that honor in'the department<br />\nof history. He held in succession<br />\nthe positions of lecturer, associate, associate professor and professor, and his connection with<br />\nthe University continued until<br />\nshortly before his death in 1901.<br />\nAdams' activities at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University were so<br />\nvaried that it is impossible to<br />\nspeak of them all in this brief<br />\nsketch. He organized the first historical seminary in America, and,<br />\nin order to provide for the publication of his own monographs and<br />\nthose of his students, he started<br />\nthe studies in historical and political science. During his lifetime<br />\nhe edited about forty volumes,<br />\nand since his death one or more<br />\nvolumes have been issued each<br />\nyear. This series revolutionized<br />\nthe study of history in America.<br />\nHis students were set to work on<br />\nspecial topics in limited fields of<br />\ninvestigation. His first students<br />\nwere drawn mainly from New England, and they were put to work<br />\non the local history of the New<br />\nEngland States. Soon, however,<br />\ngraduate students came to Baltimore from Virginia and the other<br />\nSouthern States, and they were<br />\nset to work on the local and institutional history of the South.<br />\nAdams realized that the history<br />\nof the United States could not be<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nWith this issue, THE NEWS-LETTER begins a series of<br />\narticles upon the lives and works of some of the men whose<br />\nefforts, more than any other factor, have given the Johns<br />\nHopkins University the reputation which it enjoys today.<br />\nHerbert Baxter Adams may truly be called the father of<br />\nmodern historical study in America. Through the ideals which<br />\nhe shaped at this University, a new conception of historical research was spread among the intellectual centers of the country. In him was personified the breadth of thought, the<br />\npassion for truth, the vision, which have come down to us as<br />\nthe most cherished traditions of the Hopkins scholar.<br />\nYet, absorbed in his work as he was, Adams always took<br />\na keen interest in undergraduate affairs. The memory of that<br />\ninterest is perpetuated by the Adams medal, given every year,<br />\nthrough his generosity,to the best public speaker in the second<br />\nyear, by the Adams prize of books, awarded at the annual<br />\nSenior-Junior debate, and by the Adams Literary Society,<br />\nnamed in his honor.<br />\nwritten on a large scale until<br />\nlocal and obscure sources were<br />\nmade available through monographs in the field of biography<br />\nand local history. The monographic method which he employed was soon adopted in other<br />\nAmerican universities, and the<br />\nStudies in Historical and Political<br />\nScience have been widely imitated<br />\nuntil now almost every university<br />\nin the land has a series of its own.<br />\nAdams was not a profound<br />\nscholar, for his interests took too<br />\nwide a range. Neither did he<br />\nleave behind him any great piece<br />\nof historical work, for, with the<br />\n<br />\nexception of his \"Life of Jared<br />\nSparks,\" an excellent biography<br />\nin two volumes, his own contributions were chiefly monographic.<br />\nBut it is as an organizer of historical studies and a promoter of<br />\nnew methods of historical research that he will be remembered. His enthusiasm was contagious, and this was the secret..<br />\nof his great success. He had the<br />\nrare faculty of making his students<br />\nthink that the subject which<br />\nclaimed his attention for the time<br />\nbeing in his lecture courses was<br />\nthe most important subject in the<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 1)<br />\n<br />\nHERBERT BAXTER ADAMS<br />\n<br />\nHistorian Ascribed Much of His Later<br />\nInterest in Editing to Early Journalistic Training\u2014Sketch<br />\nof His Career.<br />\n<br />\nHerbert Baxter Adams was<br />\nborn at Shutesbury (near Amherst), Mass., on April 16, 1850.<br />\nDoctor Adams' early life was<br />\nspent amidst the pleasant surroundings of Hampshire County.<br />\nHis mother and father were both<br />\nof hearty New England stock,<br />\n\u2022 their Puritan ancestors first settling in Massachusetts in 1634.<br />\nAdams' education and training<br />\nwas in large part due to the kindly help and advice of his eldest brother, Charles Dickinson<br />\nAdams.<br />\nAdams' mother had moved with<br />\nher sons, after their father's<br />\ndeath, to Amherst. It was in the<br />\nclassical environment of this town<br />\nthat Adams had his first schooling. Later, his eldest brother was<br />\ninstrumental in having him enter<br />\nPhillips Exeter Academy. Here<br />\nhe graduated at the head of his<br />\nclass in 1868. The next fall he<br />\nentered Amherst College, winning<br />\nthe Porter prize for the best entrance examinations.<br />\nIt was while at Amherst that the<br />\nfirst real influences were present<br />\nthat developed in Doctor Adams<br />\nhis remarkable abilities as a<br />\nteacher and an editor. He did<br />\nnot decide to make history his<br />\nlife work until his last year at<br />\ncollege; in fact, he did not specialize in history until he took up<br />\ngraduate work after leaving Amherst. President Seelye, of Amherst, was the man who decided<br />\nAdams on his career. In one of<br />\nhis philosophy lectures President<br />\nSeelye, who had long known and<br />\nhelped Adams, discussed the philosophy of history. It was this<br />\nlecture that turned Adams toward<br />\nthe study which he made his life<br />\nwork.<br />\nBefore that time, Herbert<br />\nAdams had looked forward to<br />\njournalism as a profession. He<br />\nhad reported at odd times for<br />\nAmherst, New York and Boston<br />\npapers, and had spent many hours<br />\nof his time in college in writing<br />\nfor his college paper.<br />\nAdams once said of this: \"My<br />\neditorial connection with The<br />\nAmherst Student really gave a<br />\npermanent bent- to my life. I<br />\nlearned more real useful knowledge in that voluntary connection<br />\nthan in all other college means<br />\nof training; in punctuation, composition, and rhetoric.

One of his favorite<br />\nsayings was: \"Seize the moment<br />\nof excited interest, for the chances<br />\nare it will never come back to<br />\nyou.\" That was the prificiple on<br />\nwhich he acted himself. If he<br />\nsaw a new book that interested<br />\nhim in the window of a store or<br />\non the table of a library, he<br />\nwould read it overnight and the<br />\nnext morning tell us all about it.<br />\nHe could get more work out of<br />\nhis students than any teacher I<br />\nhave ever known in any department of study.<br />\nAnother happy faculty which<br />\nDr. Adams possessed in a marked<br />\ndegree was that of being able to<br />\ndiscover latent talent in younger<br />\nmen. He would not let a student<br />\nlindeTtake a piece of research for<br />\nwhich he did not have the capacity, but he always managed to<br />\ndiscover whatever capacity a man<br />\nhad and to direct his efforts in<br />\nthe right channel. As a result,<br />\nprobably every student who ever<br />\nstudied under Adams feels a debt<br />\nof gratitude for some suggestion<br />\nor advice which he feels has influenced his whole life.

I Wish to express my approval and to add more concerning things that have come to light<br />\nsince that article appeared.<br />\nFirst and foremost is the comeback in spirit that Hopkins had<br />\nlast week and which was manifest<br />\nin the splendid fight which the<br />\nfootball team put up against<br />\nSwarthmore. If anyone who saw<br />\nHopkins play on Saturday for the<br />\nfirst time had been told that Hopkins' spirit had been admitted by<br />\nalmost everyone a week before to<br />\nbe nil, he would have laughed at<br />\nthe very idea. Whether it was<br />\nthe 1918 \"Pep\" Committee or the<br />\n\"Would-Be Rooter's\" letter that<br />\nstarted the awakening, we do not<br />\nknow. At any rate, the old-time<br />\nspirit has returned.<br />\nNext comes the proposed Medical School team. Every Hopkins<br />\nstudent appreciates the feeling<br />\nthat has urged the medical men<br />\nto action. But is it fair to the<br />\nundergraduates who have played<br />\non the team so far, to the few<br />\nmedical students who have conscientiously worked for the team<br />\nall season and to the other Maryland State teams to put a team<br />\nof stars from other colleges on<br />\nthe field and call them Hopkins'<br />\nteam? If we are to have a team<br />\nof Penfields and Leadbetters, why<br />\ndoes not the Athletic Association<br />\narrange a schedule that includes<br />\nteams of the class these men are<br />\naccustomed to oppose? In my<br />\nopinion, and in the opinion of<br />\nmany other Hopkins students, it<br />\nis far better to have a team on the<br />\nfield that will fight like our team<br />\ndid against Swarthmore and lose,<br />\nthan to accept the charity of<br />\nthe medical students and win.<br />\nAgainst Maryland teams we ought<br />\n<br />\nThe Smoke of the U.S.A.<br />\nThat snappy, spirited taste of \"Bull\" Durham in a<br />\ncigarette gives you the quick-stepping, head-up-andchest-out feeling of the live virile Man in Khaki.<br />\nHe smokes \"Bull\" Durham for the sparkle that's in<br />\nit and the crisp, youthful vigor he gets out of it.<br />\n<br />\nD<br />\n<br />\nGENUINE<br />\n91<br />\n<br />\n66B<br />\n<br />\nM<br />\nHA<br />\nUR<br />\nL<br />\nUL<br />\nSMOKING TOBACCO<br />\n\"Roll your own\"with \"Bull\"Durham and you have<br />\na distinctive, satisfying smoke that can't be equalled<br />\nby any other tobacco in the world.<br />\nIn its perfect mildness, its smooth, rich mellowsweetness and its aromatic fragrance, \"Bull\"<br />\nDurham is unique.<br />\nFor the last word in wholesome, healthful smoking enjoyment \"roll your own\" with \"Bull\"<br />\nDurham.<br />\n<br />\nGENUINE<br />\n<br />\nDURHAM<br />\nAAAAA<br />\n<br />\nAsk for FREE<br />\npackage of``papers\"<br />\nwith each 5c sack.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n- ,-<br />\n<br />\nSmoking Tobacco,<br />\nWDELACKWELL & CO<br />\n<br />\nSitoicTo4CToaAc(o<br />\n<br />\nTHE<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\nTOBACCO<br />\nCOMPANY<br />\n<br />\n(Si/ZINNIA' WIN.

To lose its individuality<br />\nand become an average, small college, examples of which are dotted<br />\nall over the country. Sad to say,<br />\nthe removal to Homewood, from<br />\nwhich so much was expected, is<br />\nfacilitating that. \u2022<br />\n2. The other possibility is to<br />\nreturn to the place we occupied<br />\nten years ago. To have the undergraduate department be a vital<br />\npart of that institution of learning we so proudly call \"The Johns<br />\nHopkins University.\" I therefor<br />\nwish to sound a call for \"university spirit,\" a spirit which should<br />\nstrive for things higher than a<br />\nState football championship.<br />\nJUNIOR.<br />\nOctober 31, 1916.<br />\nTo<br />\n<br />\nRe-enter the \"Would-Be Rooter.\"<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LEVER:<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014Have we no pride? Have<br />\nwe no self-respect? Are we totally<br />\nvoid of any self-esteem? Reports<br />\nare being circulated that the<br />\nMedical School is organizing a<br />\nfootball team of \"old-timers,\" and<br />\nlacks but three backfield men.<br />\nWe are to supply them. Then,<br />\nthese veterans are to proceed to<br />\nwin the Maryland (minus Annapolis) State championship. Is<br />\nthere no one else in this whole<br />\nUniversity who will stand up with<br />\nme and say: \"We don't want<br />\nthem !\" We don't want the State<br />\nchampionship if we must take<br />\nsecond-hand players, who have left<br />\ntheir college spirit with their respective colleges, and are at Hopkins to study medicine! We don't<br />\nwant the State championship<br />\nanyway, because it has no meaning!<br />\nWake up Does no one realize<br />\nthat this is no way to carry on<br />\nour athletics? I reiterate that<br />\nwe must stop the Athletic Association from pursuing its<br />\npolicy: \"Give us enough ready developed men and we will turn out<br />\na successful team.\" Examine the<br />\nlist of men on this Medical School<br />\nteam, as given by The Sun. Few<br />\nare Hopkins men who have spent<br />\ntheir under-graduate days playing for us. Two are Princeton<br />\n<br />\nmen, one having been a varsity<br />\nplayer in 1912. Three have already been captains at their respective colleges. Do you get my<br />\npoint? Why should we be thrilled<br />\nby the performance of such men?<br />\nWe should be ashamed to appear<br />\nat all within Homewood field, to<br />\nacknowledge that such is the<br />\nteam we adnlit to be our representative.<br />\nSuppose these old-timers, in<br />\nspite of their radiantly glorious<br />\nreputation, proceed to lose the<br />\nWestern Maryland game. What<br />\nthen? Will an all-providing Athletic Association proceed to call<br />\na special session and agree to<br />\nspend a few extra dollars and<br />\nhave the \"band\" on the field Monday afternoon at the beginning of<br />\npractice? Will the four undergraduate classes appear in a mass<br />\nand march around the field and<br />\ncheer themselves hoarse to show<br />\nthe team (the old-timers) that in<br />\nspite of the fact that they have<br />\nlost the State championship<br />\nthere is still the St. John's game?<br />\nThat is virtually what occurred at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nafter they lost their first game.<br />\nBut, will we do it? Why should<br />\nwe do it? It certainly won't make<br />\nthe old-timers play better!<br />\nBut, suppose they win\u2014what a<br />\nglorious victory it will be! How<br />\nproud we shall be of our University! The first real game for the<br />\nState championship will have been<br />\nwon\u2014through charity. Or, do<br />\nyou frankly believe that these oldtimers are to play spontaneously,<br />\nbecause of their love for Johns<br />\nHopkins University?<br />\nThe prime object of a team is<br />\nnot merely to win games (for if it<br />\nwere we could hire professionals) ;<br />\nits object is to represent its college<br />\nupon the athletic field. To accept<br />\nsuch a team as we are about to<br />\nplace in the field is to admit that<br />\nthe undergraduate department is<br />\na nonentity. Why should we<br />\ncome week after week to see a<br />\nteam consisting of men whom we<br />\nhardly know to speak to, except<br />\nperhaps through our fraternal<br />\naffiliation? If, however, we are to<br />\naccept this Medical School team,<br />\nI respectfully suggest to the Athletic Association that it organize<br />\nfour class teams and conduct a<br />\nseries of interclass games. Personally, I would rather root for<br />\nmy class team than for a team of<br />\nmen whom I don't know to speak<br />\nto, even though the latter be playing for the \"State\" championship.<br />\nAt the mass-meeting in the Mechanical Engineering Building<br />\nlast Wednesday noon the speaker<br />\nmentioned my letter in the last<br />\nissue as being \"the second rotten<br />\nknock at our football team\"; the<br />\nfirst being the write-up given<br />\n<br />\nJack Branham by one of our city<br />\npapers after the Gettysburg game.<br />\nAfter the meeting I conscientipusPrescription Opticians<br />\nly re-read my letter.

Other men may report during the course of the<br />\nweek, but those who have definitely decided to come out for the<br />\nteam are as follows: Leadbetter,<br />\nMicklethwait, Martindale, Tillet,<br />\nOrmond, Finney, Jackson, Hartman, Stackford and Callender.<br />\nJackson, Hartman, Martindale<br />\nand Finney have all been members of other Hopkins teams. Callender was a sub-quarter at Harvard. Tillet was on a University of Georgia team, and was<br />\nchosen all-Southern quarterback.<br />\nNot a man on the list is not an<br />\nexperienced player or one whose<br />\npresence will not make a decided<br />\naddition to the Hopkins squad.<br />\nIn addition, the majority of these<br />\nmen are linesmen, who,at present,<br />\nare regarded as constituting the<br />\nBlack and Blue's greatest need.<br />\nThroughout the season, efforts<br />\nhave been constantly made to induce some or all of these men to<br />\nreport for practice, but until last<br />\nSaturday these efforts were unavailing. At the meeting Saturday morning, however, Drs. Bridgman, Stone and Bernheim made<br />\npersonal appeals to the men to<br />\nlend their efforts to the development of another championship<br />\neleven\u2014with the above list of recruits as a result.<br />\nThe reluctance of the men to<br />\npractice with the team heretofore<br />\nhas been due entirely to the<br />\namount of work which study at the<br />\nHopkins Medical School entails.<br />\nThe hours run practically from<br />\nnine to five every day, and, in the<br />\nlater years, often longer.<br />\nThe Athletic Association is endeavoring to procure enough autos<br />\nto call for the men every day, so<br />\nas to bring them to Homewood<br />\nField in the quickest possible<br />\ntime after they are released from<br />\nthe laboratory. It is extremely<br />\nimprobable, however, that, even<br />\nwith this convenience, the whole<br />\nsquad can go into action soon<br />\nenough to obtain much daylight<br />\nscrimmage.<br /><br />\nAt a meeting of the Senior<br />\nClass, held last Friday, Prof. Carl<br />\nC. Thomas, professor of mechanical engineering and head of the<br />\nHopkins Mechanical Engineering<br />\nSchool, was elected honorary class<br />\npresident.<br />\nProfessor Thomas, who has the<br />\nhonor -of being the first man from<br />\nthe Engineering School to be<br />\nchosen honorary president of a<br />\ngraduating class, has won a nation-wide reputation by his work.<br />\nHe has been connected with three<br />\nother universities besides Hopkins\u2014Cornell, New York and<br />\nWisconsin. At the first of these<br />\nhe was professor of marine engineering and naval architecture;<br />\nat the second, professor of marine<br />\nengineering; and at the third, professor of steam and gas engineering.<br />\nThe election of the honorary<br />\npresident was the first business<br />\nof the day. .After it was concluded, President Sutton announced that another member was<br />\nto be elected to the Student Council. Henry Baker, of the Engineering School, was chosen to.this<br />\nposition.<br />\nSutton next announced that, to<br />\nfollow up the way blazed by the<br />\nJunior Class, a committee of ten<br />\nhad been appointed to arouse the<br />\nclass' spirit in support of the<br />\nfootball team. The committee<br />\nconsisted of Howard Wilson,<br />\nchairman; Firor, Hobleman,<br />\nSkinner Steinbach, Twigg, Cecil,<br />\nE. G. Hall, E. L. Smith and<br />\nWatson.<br />\nHenry Straus, editor-in-chief<br />\nof the 1917 Hullabaloo, then addressed the meeting, explaining<br />\nthe change of purpose which the<br />\neditors had determined upon for<br />\nthe book, and asking the support<br />\nof all for the benefit to be given<br />\non November 24. He was followed by W. B. Baxley, who exhorted the class to support the<br />\nmilitary training movement, not<br />\nonly in principle, but in actual<br />\nreport at the drills. \u2022<br /><br />\nIn a game that will go down<br />\nin the annals of history as being<br />\none of the most spirited contests<br />\never witnessed on Homewood<br />\nfield, Hopkins 'vasity eleven was<br />\ndefeated by Swarthmore on Saturday, 14 to 6.<br />\nSeldom has a Black and Blue<br />\neleven played with more fight and<br />\ndetermination. Outweighed and<br />\nplaying against a more experienced team, Hopkins held the visitors to two touchdowns, which<br />\nwere scored by Swarthmore during the first 10 minutes of play.<br />\nThereafter, especially during the<br />\nsecond half, Hopkins kept the ball<br />\nin the visitors' territory and prevented further scoring by the<br />\nQuakers by fighting against a superior team with apparently exhaustless spirit and energy. Their<br />\nreward, and what might be termed<br />\nthe climax of their endeavors,<br />\ncanVe during the last three minutes of play, when Hopkins, after<br />\nrecovering the ball on a fumble<br />\nmade by Swarthmore, scored a<br />\ntouchdown.<br />\nThe day was by no means ideal<br />\nfor a football contest. On the<br />\nother hand, a drizzling rain kept<br />\nthe field and ball very slippery,<br />\nand frequent fumbles by both<br />\nteams was the result. The bad<br />\nweather conditions kept most of<br />\nthe indifferent class of spectators<br />\nindoors, but Hopkins' rooters<br />\nturned out in force and added to<br />\nthe enthusiasm and spirit of the<br />\naffair.<br />\nThe cheering and singing by the<br />\nrooting section was carried on in<br />\na highly commendable manner.<br />\nIt was clearly evident that the<br />\nyell practices of the past week<br />\nhad done a world of good. The<br />\ncheering heretofore has been of a<br />\nvery mediocre character, but last<br />\nSaturday the Black and Blue<br />\nrooting section really got behind<br />\nthe team, and 'despite the weather<br />\nconditions, the cheers did not lag<br />\nas formerly.<br />\nHowever, the stands had good<br />\ncause to show their confidence in<br />\nthe Black and Blue eleven. The<br />\nlatter part of the second half was<br />\nabout as thrilling as any ever<br />\nstaged<br />\non<br />\nHomewood<br />\nfield.<br />\nSwarthmore had two touchdowns<br />\nto her credit, but try as they<br />\nmight every time they started a<br />\nrally a fumble would intervene<br />\nand a Hopkins man would snatch<br />\nthe ball. Hopkins thus had<br />\nseveral chances to score, but<br />\nmissed by inches completing one<br /><br />\nBy COACH BRENNICK<br /><br />\nOn Saturday the team won the<br />\npraise of the student body, the<br />\nalumni, friends, and of the<br />\ncoaches\u2014and this notwithstanding the fact that they lost\u2014because they played a fighting, spirited and intelligent game, such as<br />\nbefitted a Hopkins team. In<br />\nSwarthmore they met one of the<br />\nbest teams in the East, fresh from<br />\nits victory over Pennsylvania, so<br />\nthat, playing as our team did, the<br />\ncontest was a splendid one from<br />\nbeginning to end. Our line again<br />\ndistinguished itself, but the backfield came into its own also on<br />\nSaturday, and gives promise of<br />\nmuch greater development. Branham and Hopkins played great<br />\nfootball, both on offense and defense, and showed they were able<br />\nto stand up under heavy strain.<br />\nCalkins, a freshman, showed the<br />\ncoaches that he has the makings<br />\nof a fine player, if the improvement he exhibited on Saturday is<br />\ncontinued. Every man that entered the contest showed that he<br />\nhad fight and spirit, and even if<br />\nnothing else but these features<br />\nwere shown, the team deserved the<br />\ncongratulations given \u2022 them by<br />\ntheir fellow-students after the<br />\ngame.<br />\nBut fight and spirit alone do<br />\nnot win football games. Indeed,<br />\nis it not the fact that the defeated<br />\nteam often shows more spirit and<br />\nfight than the winner? What we<br />\nmust have is an efficient team, a<br />\nteam that can do the purely physical work in a more or less subconscious way while using their<br />\nbrains to adjust themselves to the<br />\nvarious conditions which may confront them during a contest. The<br />\nfirst signs of this kind of a team<br />\npresented themselves Saturday,<br />\nand it was this aspect of the case<br />\nwhich was most pleasing to the<br />\ncoaches and those who are closely<br />\nwatching the team's development.<br />\nThe past three games have<br />\nplainly indicated that, game and<br />\nspirited as our line is, it must be<br />\nstrengthened if we are to successfully cope with future opponents.<br />\nThe present line plays a splendid<br />\ndefensive game, but when it comes<br />\nto lifting, on the offense, the<br />\nstrength is wanting. This does<br />\nnot mean that the present line is<br />\nto be discarded; far from it. It<br />\ncontains too many splendid players; men who would be an addition to any team. They are fine<br />\nmen for part of a game, but not<br />\n(Continued on page 12, col. 2)<br /><br />\nThe enrollment at Wellesley for<br />\nthe present college year is about<br />\n1,575, with a freshman class of<br />\n510.\u2014Ex.<br /><br />\nImprovements, the total cost of<br />\nwhich will reach $150,000 or $200,000, have been under way since<br />\nearly last summer at Delaware<br />\nCollege.

An envelope containing<br />\ntwelve slips, each slip having<br />\nupon it some argument in favor<br />\nof life insurance, was given to<br />\nevery member of the class, and<br />\nthe men were instructed to arrange and number the slips in accordance with the relative appeal<br />\nwhich they presented.<br />\nThe twelve arguments submitted covered a wide field, ranging<br />\nfrom general statistical facts to<br />\ninvocations of sentiments entirely<br />\npersonal.

Many seniors,<br />\nsophomores and freshmen, as they<br />\ncame into the door of the lectureroom of the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding, casually wondered what<br />\nhad caused the enormous increase<br />\nin attendance which met their<br />\neyes. As the crowd swelled larger<br />\nand larger, that wonder grew with<br />\nit\u2014among all, except the juniors.<br />\nTwo or three yells were given, and<br />\nthen there arose a shout of \"18<br />\nthis way,\" and there was what<br />\nseemed to be a general migration<br />\nto the corner of the room where<br />\nBob Duncan was perched on a<br />\nconvenient window sill.<br />\nThe rest of the men were impatiently awaiting an explanation<br />\nof these unexpected proceedings<br />\n\u2014and Duncan gave it, in a short<br />\nspeech entirely devoid of any attempt at inspiring rhetoric, but<br />\nwhich simply stated a fact. The<br />\ncheering and the support of the<br />\nfootball team in general had been<br />\nunmitigatedly rotten, he said;<br />\nsomething had to be done\u2014and<br />\nthe, juniors proposed doing it.<br />\nThey were going to form a separate organization, stick together<br />\nat yell practices, and come out in<br />\na body to watch the team scrimmage. Above everything, every<br />\nman in the class was to be part<br />\nof the unit. That was all.<br />\nOf course, that was not all. It<br />\nwas not all at that cheering practice itself, the enthusiasm of<br />\nwhich showed to the Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen a side of their University as yet unknown; nor was it<br />\nall when the football team last<br />\nFriday afternoon went through<br />\ntheir final evolutions before a<br />\ngrandstand which had as many<br />\nwildly rooting men in it as had<br />\nthe entire cheering section at any<br />\nof the preceding games.

What has otherwise been<br />\na very successful work has been<br />\nmarred by the need of the 60 recruits required to bring the battalion up to full strength.<br />\nOne of the most notiCeable features of recent drills is the fact<br />\nthat each company is striving its<br />\nhardest to surpass the others in<br />\nexcellence. The discipline is not<br />\nas good as it should be, but the<br />\nspirit is almost as earne.st as<br />\ncould be desired.<br />\n_ Half of the hour last Monday<br />\nwas spent in battalion drill.<br />\nWhile an interested audience of<br />\nprofessors, students school teachers and others taking afternoon<br />\ncourses looked on, the battalion<br />\nwas reviewed by Lieutenant<br />\nElliott. As each company came<br />\nwithin a few paces of him the<br />\ncommand \"eyes right\" was given,<br />\nand in two straight lines the company marched past. After a few<br />\nmore commands were executed in<br />\n\u2022<br />\nbattalion formations, the companies were turned over to their<br />\nrespective captains.<br />\nThe progress at drills is so<br />\nFIFTEEN CENTS<br />\nrapid that Lieutenant Elliott has<br />\nbeen able to cover about half of<br />\nthe movements in close order<br />\ncompany drill. One reason for<br />\nthis progress is that the commands -and movements are discussed before the drills by Lieutenant Elliott in his lectures. In<br />\nthis way every man learns what<br />\nhe has to do, and. no time is lost<br />\nat drills in explanations.<br />\nA few changes have been made<br />\nin the companies.

And yet Hopkins<br />\nheld Swarthmore to two touchdowns, both made in the first half.<br />\nOutweighed, playing against a<br />\nfrankly superior team, Hopkins<br />\ngritted its teeth and fought\u2014and<br />\nfought so well that the struggle<br />\nbecame equal.<br />\nThe team has found itself; the<br />\nUniversity is lined up behind it;<br />\nall Hopkins is in fighting trim.<br />\nWhether we win the championship or lose it, there could have<br />\nbeen no better prelude to the first<br />\nreal struggle for its possession<br />\nthan last Saturday's defeat.<br />\nAn Inadvisable Change.<br /><br />\nSince its first publication, the<br />\nHullabaloo has been the book of<br />\none class. In it each successive<br />\ngroup of graduates has found its<br />\nexpression; consciously or unconsciously, it has depicted the Hopkins senior. For that reason, the<br />\nbook has meant something\u2014has<br /><br />\nbeen more than a mere publication. It has belonged to the<br />\nseniors; they have felt that it has<br />\nbelonged to them, and they have<br />\nmade it worthy.<br />\nYet, although the Hullabaloos<br />\nof the past have been pre-eminently class books, every under-graduate institution and interest has<br />\nhad representation in their pages,<br />\nevery under-graduate class has<br />\nhad its own separate section\u2014<br />\nwith the proportion always maintained. A change in Hullabaloo<br />\npolicy can mean only one thing\u2014<br />\nthat proportion is to be destroyed; with the exception of the<br />\nphotographs and write-ups of the<br />\ngraduates, the Hullabaloo of the<br />\nfuture is not to be a senior book.<br />\nHopkins does not need an under-graduate annal. As a matter<br />\nof fact, it does not want an under-graduate annal. The Hullabaloo should be supported by<br />\nevery under-classman, but it<br />\nshould be supported because it is<br />\na Hopkins institution, not because<br />\nthat under-classman happens to<br />\nhave a photograph displayed on<br />\none of its pages.<br />\nIn the Hullabaloos of the past,<br />\nthe seniors have been given that<br />\npeculiar sense of individual possession that comes to men when<br />\nthey feel that a thing has grown<br />\nup in their own image. The Hullabaloo, as a class book, has been<br />\na personal bond between those,<br />\nwho, for four years, have worked<br />\nand lived together, a bond that an<br />\nunder-graduate annal could never<br />\nbe. The Hullabaloo has belonged<br />\nto the seniors\u2014and it has belonged to them of right.<br />\nThis is not the narrower policy;<br />\nit is the broader one. Breadth of<br />\nvision does not necessarily go<br />\nwith mere expanse of canvas.<br />\nAnd, because it has been the book<br />\nof one class and one class alone,<br />\nthe Hullabaloo of the past has reflected its University in the only<br />\nway that a University can be reflected in printed pages\u2014in the<br />\ntone in which those pages are conceived.<br />\nTIIE NEWS-LETTER has the greatest respect for the opinions of the<br />\nmembers of the 1917 Hullabaloo<br />\nBoard, but if feels constrained to<br />\nstate that it believes the change<br />\nwhich that board has announced<br />\nin the nature of the Hullabaloo<br />\nto be an inadvisable one.<br /><br />\nit had not passed irredeemably<br />\ninto the limbo of the departed, it<br />\nwas last Wednesday. That sign<br />\nwas given, given at what we devoutly hope was the end of the<br />\nmost dreary, listless, and enervating series of yell practices<br />\n(Heaven save the mark!) which<br />\nhas ever disgraced our University.<br />\nJust what the juniors did, and<br />\nhow they did it, is known to every<br />\nHopkins man. Just what results<br />\ntheir action will have, or rather,<br />\nhow long the results will last, is<br />\nknown to no one. But the great<br />\nmerit of the \"Pep\" Committee<br />\nwhich they appointed consists in<br />\nthe very fact of its appointment;<br />\nit shows that one class, at least,<br />\nhas still enough fire, enough backbone, enough vision, to start something\u2014and, in its history, Hopkins was never in more patent<br />\nneed for something to be started.<br />\nThe action which created the<br />\ncommittee has been followed up<br />\nby the men responsible for it, and<br />\nfollowed up with an enthusiasm<br />\nto which the last two yell practices bear ample witness. The<br />\nmovement to which it has given<br />\nrise may eliminate a few rather<br />\ntough problems, or it may only<br />\nprecipitate them, but on one point<br />\nthe University is united-1918 is<br />\ndistinctly a class.<br />\nThe Battalion.<br /><br />\nThat the inauguration of military training has met with the approval of the Hopkins student<br />\nbody, and that the battalion itself is in a highly satisfactory<br />\nstate of development, the drills on<br />\nthe campus are evidencing without a shadow of doubt. Lieutenant Elliott has shown himself to<br />\nbe an organizer who knows how to<br />\ncombine the necessary amount of<br />\ndisciplinary strictness with the<br />\nrare capacity of arousing and sustaining undergraduate enthusiasm, and the heartiness of the response with which he has met has<br />\nbeen unmistakable.<br />\nThere is a peculiarly exhilarating sensation in being in the forerank of a movement, especially<br />\nwhen that movement has already<br />\nmet with nation-wide approval.<br />\nMilitary training at colleges, it<br />\nmust be remembered, save in cadet<br />\ninstitutions of long standing, is<br />\nscarcely a year old \u2014 and last<br />\nspring men were drilling in front<br />\nof Gilman Hall. We have not, of<br />\ncourse, made as rapid strides in<br />\nthe movement as have such univerThe \"Pep\" Committee.<br />\nsities as Harvard, where there is<br />\nIf there ever was a time when an undergraduate enrollment of<br />\nHopkins needed an overt sign to two or three thousand; as yet,<br />\nshow that, so far as the spirit of we have no fully equipped regiits undergraduates was concerned, ment, ready to take the field at a<br /><br />\nmoment's notice, but, in proportion to our size, we have done as<br />\nmuch as any college in the<br />\ncountry, and, irrespective of our<br />\nsize, the marchers on the campus<br />\nare already an entirely presentable aggregation.<br />\nYet the appeal has gone out for<br />\nenough upper-classmen to bring<br />\nthe battalion up to full strength<br />\n\u2014and that appeal should be answered. The number of sophomores, juniors and seniors now<br />\ndrilling with the corps has shown<br />\nthat the movement has a firmer<br />\nbasis than mere compulsion; every<br />\nadditional recruit indicates still<br />\nmore clearly that military training has come to Hopkins to stay.<br /><br />\nAT OTHER COLLEGES<br />\nCo-eds at Earlham College are<br />\nattending football lectures, given<br />\nby Coach Whiteside, in order to<br />\nobtain a better understanding of<br />\nthe game.\u2014Ex.<br />\n* *<br />\n*<br />\nA bound volume of the Princeton for the school year 1878-1879<br />\nhas been presented to President<br />\nWoodrow Wilson, who was manwring editor of the publication<br />\nthat year.\u2014Ex.<br />\n* * *<br />\nOn October 13, Harvard cast its<br />\nesidential straw ballot.

JOHN H. LATANE'<br /><br />\nis hard for those of us who<br />\nwere here in the nineties to realize that to the students now in<br />\nresidence, and even to some members of the faculty, Herbert B.<br />\nAdams is merely a name. To us<br />\nhe is still a very real personality.<br />\nWe remember him as the embodiment of energy and initiative, influential in all University affairs<br />\nand actively interested in those<br />\nmatters which touched the life of<br />\nthe community, for he believed<br />\nwith Jules Siegfried that the<br />\n\"education of the people is the<br />\nfirst duty of democracy.\"<br />\nAdams was a native of Massachusetts, and came of old New<br />\nEngland stock. After graduating<br />\nfrom Amherst College and teaching Latin, Greek, mathematics<br />\nand classical history at Williston<br />\nSeminary for a year, he went to<br />\nGermany, and in 1870 received<br />\nthe degree of doctor of philosophy<br />\nat Heidelberg. That very year<br />\nthe - Johns Hopkins University<br />\nopened its doors to students, offering opportunities for investigation and research which had<br />\nnever before been available in<br />\nAmerica. Adams at once applied<br />\nfor and was awarded a fellowship<br />\nand was thus the first appointee<br />\nto that honor in'the department<br />\nof history. He held in succession<br />\nthe positions of lecturer, associate, associate professor and professor, and his connection with<br />\nthe University continued until<br />\nshortly before his death in 1901.<br />\nAdams' activities at the Johns<br />\nHopkins University were so<br />\nvaried that it is impossible to<br />\nspeak of them all in this brief<br />\nsketch. He organized the first historical seminary in America, and,<br />\nin order to provide for the publication of his own monographs and<br />\nthose of his students, he started<br />\nthe studies in historical and political science. During his lifetime<br />\nhe edited about forty volumes,<br />\nand since his death one or more<br />\nvolumes have been issued each<br />\nyear. This series revolutionized<br />\nthe study of history in America.<br />\nHis students were set to work on<br />\nspecial topics in limited fields of<br />\ninvestigation. His first students<br />\nwere drawn mainly from New England, and they were put to work<br />\non the local history of the New<br />\nEngland States. Soon, however,<br />\ngraduate students came to Baltimore from Virginia and the other<br />\nSouthern States, and they were<br />\nset to work on the local and institutional history of the South.<br />\nAdams realized that the history<br />\nof the United States could not be<br />\nIt<br /><br />\nWith this issue, THE NEWS-LETTER begins a series of<br />\narticles upon the lives and works of some of the men whose<br />\nefforts, more than any other factor, have given the Johns<br />\nHopkins University the reputation which it enjoys today.<br />\nHerbert Baxter Adams may truly be called the father of<br />\nmodern historical study in America. Through the ideals which<br />\nhe shaped at this University, a new conception of historical research was spread among the intellectual centers of the country. In him was personified the breadth of thought, the<br />\npassion for truth, the vision, which have come down to us as<br />\nthe most cherished traditions of the Hopkins scholar.<br />\nYet, absorbed in his work as he was, Adams always took<br />\na keen interest in undergraduate affairs. The memory of that<br />\ninterest is perpetuated by the Adams medal, given every year,<br />\nthrough his generosity,to the best public speaker in the second<br />\nyear, by the Adams prize of books, awarded at the annual<br />\nSenior-Junior debate, and by the Adams Literary Society,<br />\nnamed in his honor.<br />\nwritten on a large scale until<br />\nlocal and obscure sources were<br />\nmade available through monographs in the field of biography<br />\nand local history. The monographic method which he employed was soon adopted in other<br />\nAmerican universities, and the<br />\nStudies in Historical and Political<br />\nScience have been widely imitated<br />\nuntil now almost every university<br />\nin the land has a series of its own.<br />\nAdams was not a profound<br />\nscholar, for his interests took too<br />\nwide a range. Neither did he<br />\nleave behind him any great piece<br />\nof historical work, for, with the<br /><br />\nexception of his \"Life of Jared<br />\nSparks,\" an excellent biography<br />\nin two volumes, his own contributions were chiefly monographic.<br />\nBut it is as an organizer of historical studies and a promoter of<br />\nnew methods of historical research that he will be remembered. His enthusiasm was contagious, and this was the secret..<br />\nof his great success. He had the<br />\nrare faculty of making his students<br />\nthink that the subject which<br />\nclaimed his attention for the time<br />\nbeing in his lecture courses was<br />\nthe most important subject in the<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 1)<br /><br />\nHERBERT BAXTER ADAMS<br /><br />\nHistorian Ascribed Much of His Later<br />\nInterest in Editing to Early Journalistic Training\u2014Sketch<br />\nof His Career.<br /><br />\nHerbert Baxter Adams was<br />\nborn at Shutesbury (near Amherst), Mass., on April 16, 1850.<br />\nDoctor Adams' early life was<br />\nspent amidst the pleasant surroundings of Hampshire County.<br />\nHis mother and father were both<br />\nof hearty New England stock,<br />\n\u2022 their Puritan ancestors first settling in Massachusetts in 1634.<br />\nAdams' education and training<br />\nwas in large part due to the kindly help and advice of his eldest brother, Charles Dickinson<br />\nAdams.<br />\nAdams' mother had moved with<br />\nher sons, after their father's<br />\ndeath, to Amherst. It was in the<br />\nclassical environment of this town<br />\nthat Adams had his first schooling. Later, his eldest brother was<br />\ninstrumental in having him enter<br />\nPhillips Exeter Academy. Here<br />\nhe graduated at the head of his<br />\nclass in 1868. The next fall he<br />\nentered Amherst College, winning<br />\nthe Porter prize for the best entrance examinations.<br />\nIt was while at Amherst that the<br />\nfirst real influences were present<br />\nthat developed in Doctor Adams<br />\nhis remarkable abilities as a<br />\nteacher and an editor. He did<br />\nnot decide to make history his<br />\nlife work until his last year at<br />\ncollege; in fact, he did not specialize in history until he took up<br />\ngraduate work after leaving Amherst. President Seelye, of Amherst, was the man who decided<br />\nAdams on his career. In one of<br />\nhis philosophy lectures President<br />\nSeelye, who had long known and<br />\nhelped Adams, discussed the philosophy of history. It was this<br />\nlecture that turned Adams toward<br />\nthe study which he made his life<br />\nwork.<br />\nBefore that time, Herbert<br />\nAdams had looked forward to<br />\njournalism as a profession. He<br />\nhad reported at odd times for<br />\nAmherst, New York and Boston<br />\npapers, and had spent many hours<br />\nof his time in college in writing<br />\nfor his college paper.<br />\nAdams once said of this: \"My<br />\neditorial connection with The<br />\nAmherst Student really gave a<br />\npermanent bent- to my life. I<br />\nlearned more real useful knowledge in that voluntary connection<br />\nthan in all other college means<br />\nof training; in punctuation, composition, and rhetoric.

One of his favorite<br />\nsayings was: \"Seize the moment<br />\nof excited interest, for the chances<br />\nare it will never come back to<br />\nyou.\" That was the prificiple on<br />\nwhich he acted himself. If he<br />\nsaw a new book that interested<br />\nhim in the window of a store or<br />\non the table of a library, he<br />\nwould read it overnight and the<br />\nnext morning tell us all about it.<br />\nHe could get more work out of<br />\nhis students than any teacher I<br />\nhave ever known in any department of study.<br />\nAnother happy faculty which<br />\nDr. Adams possessed in a marked<br />\ndegree was that of being able to<br />\ndiscover latent talent in younger<br />\nmen. He would not let a student<br />\nlindeTtake a piece of research for<br />\nwhich he did not have the capacity, but he always managed to<br />\ndiscover whatever capacity a man<br />\nhad and to direct his efforts in<br />\nthe right channel. As a result,<br />\nprobably every student who ever<br />\nstudied under Adams feels a debt<br />\nof gratitude for some suggestion<br />\nor advice which he feels has influenced his whole life. Adams'<br />\nown range of interests was so<br />\nwide that he sent out men who<br />\nachieved success in widely different fields of activity.

At any rate, the old-time<br />\nspirit has returned.<br />\nNext comes the proposed Medical School team. Every Hopkins<br />\nstudent appreciates the feeling<br />\nthat has urged the medical men<br />\nto action. But is it fair to the<br />\nundergraduates who have played<br />\non the team so far, to the few<br />\nmedical students who have conscientiously worked for the team<br />\nall season and to the other Maryland State teams to put a team<br />\nof stars from other colleges on<br />\nthe field and call them Hopkins'<br />\nteam? If we are to have a team<br />\nof Penfields and Leadbetters, why<br />\ndoes not the Athletic Association<br />\narrange a schedule that includes<br />\nteams of the class these men are<br />\naccustomed to oppose? In my<br />\nopinion, and in the opinion of<br />\nmany other Hopkins students, it<br />\nis far better to have a team on the<br />\nfield that will fight like our team<br />\ndid against Swarthmore and lose,<br />\nthan to accept the charity of<br />\nthe medical students and win.<br />\nAgainst Maryland teams we ought<br /><br />\nThe Smoke of the U.S.A.<br />\nThat snappy, spirited taste of \"Bull\" Durham in a<br />\ncigarette gives you the quick-stepping, head-up-andchest-out feeling of the live virile Man in Khaki.<br />\nHe smokes \"Bull\" Durham for the sparkle that's in<br />\nit and the crisp, youthful vigor he gets out of it.<br /><br />\nD<br /><br />\nGENUINE<br />\n91<br /><br />\n66B<br /><br />\nM<br />\nHA<br />\nUR<br />\nL<br />\nUL<br />\nSMOKING TOBACCO<br />\n\"Roll your own\"with \"Bull\"Durham and you have<br />\na distinctive, satisfying smoke that can't be equalled<br />\nby any other tobacco in the world.<br />\nIn its perfect mildness, its smooth, rich mellowsweetness and its aromatic fragrance, \"Bull\"<br />\nDurham is unique.<br />\nFor the last word in wholesome, healthful smoking enjoyment \"roll your own\" with \"Bull\"<br />\nDurham.<br /><br />\nGENUINE<br /><br />\nDURHAM<br />\nAAAAA<br /><br />\nAsk for FREE<br />\npackage of``papers\"<br />\nwith each 5c sack.<br /><br />\n2<br />\n- ,-<br /><br />\nSmoking Tobacco,<br />\nWDELACKWELL &amp; CO<br /><br />\nSitoicTo4CToaAc(o<br /><br />\nTHE<br />\nAMERICAN<br />\nTOBACCO<br />\nCOMPANY<br /><br />\n(Si/ZINNIA' WIN.

To lose its individuality<br />\nand become an average, small college, examples of which are dotted<br />\nall over the country. Sad to say,<br />\nthe removal to Homewood, from<br />\nwhich so much was expected, is<br />\nfacilitating that. \u2022<br />\n2. The other possibility is to<br />\nreturn to the place we occupied<br />\nten years ago. To have the undergraduate department be a vital<br />\npart of that institution of learning we so proudly call \"The Johns<br />\nHopkins University.\" I therefor<br />\nwish to sound a call for \"university spirit,\" a spirit which should<br />\nstrive for things higher than a<br />\nState football championship.<br />\nJUNIOR.<br />\nOctober 31, 1916.<br />\nTo<br /><br />\nRe-enter the \"Would-Be Rooter.\"<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LEVER:<br /><br />\nSir\u2014Have we no pride? Have<br />\nwe no self-respect? Are we totally<br />\nvoid of any self-esteem? Reports<br />\nare being circulated that the<br />\nMedical School is organizing a<br />\nfootball team of \"old-timers,\" and<br />\nlacks but three backfield men.<br />\nWe are to supply them. Then,<br />\nthese veterans are to proceed to<br />\nwin the Maryland (minus Annapolis) State championship. Is<br />\nthere no one else in this whole<br />\nUniversity who will stand up with<br />\nme and say: \"We don't want<br />\nthem !\" We don't want the State<br />\nchampionship if we must take<br />\nsecond-hand players, who have left<br />\ntheir college spirit with their respective colleges, and are at Hopkins to study medicine! We don't<br />\nwant the State championship<br />\nanyway, because it has no meaning!<br />\nWake up Does no one realize<br />\nthat this is no way to carry on<br />\nour athletics? I reiterate that<br />\nwe must stop the Athletic Association from pursuing its<br />\npolicy: \"Give us enough ready developed men and we will turn out<br />\na successful team.\" Examine the<br />\nlist of men on this Medical School<br />\nteam, as given by The Sun. Few<br />\nare Hopkins men who have spent<br />\ntheir under-graduate days playing for us. Two are Princeton<br /><br />\nmen, one having been a varsity<br />\nplayer in 1912. Three have already been captains at their respective colleges. Do you get my<br />\npoint? Why should we be thrilled<br />\nby the performance of such men?<br />\nWe should be ashamed to appear<br />\nat all within Homewood field, to<br />\nacknowledge that such is the<br />\nteam we adnlit to be our representative.<br />\nSuppose these old-timers, in<br />\nspite of their radiantly glorious<br />\nreputation, proceed to lose the<br />\nWestern Maryland game. What<br />\nthen? Will an all-providing Athletic Association proceed to call<br />\na special session and agree to<br />\nspend a few extra dollars and<br />\nhave the \"band\" on the field Monday afternoon at the beginning of<br />\npractice? Will the four undergraduate classes appear in a mass<br />\nand march around the field and<br />\ncheer themselves hoarse to show<br />\nthe team (the old-timers) that in<br />\nspite of the fact that they have<br />\nlost the State championship<br />\nthere is still the St. John's game?<br />\nThat is virtually what occurred at<br />\nthe University of Pennsylvania<br />\nafter they lost their first game.<br />\nBut, will we do it? Why should<br />\nwe do it? It certainly won't make<br />\nthe old-timers play better!<br />\nBut, suppose they win\u2014what a<br />\nglorious victory it will be! How<br />\nproud we shall be of our University! The first real game for the<br />\nState championship will have been<br />\nwon\u2014through charity. Or, do<br />\nyou frankly believe that these oldtimers are to play spontaneously,<br />\nbecause of their love for Johns<br />\nHopkins University?<br />\nThe prime object of a team is<br />\nnot merely to win games (for if it<br />\nwere we could hire professionals) ;<br />\nits object is to represent its college<br />\nupon the athletic field. To accept<br />\nsuch a team as we are about to<br />\nplace in the field is to admit that<br />\nthe undergraduate department is<br />\na nonentity. Why should we<br />\ncome week after week to see a<br />\nteam consisting of men whom we<br />\nhardly know to speak to, except<br />\nperhaps through our fraternal<br />\naffiliation? If, however, we are to<br />\naccept this Medical School team,<br />\nI respectfully suggest to the Athletic Association that it organize<br />\nfour class teams and conduct a<br />\nseries of interclass games. Personally, I would rather root for<br />\nmy class team than for a team of<br />\nmen whom I don't know to speak<br />\nto, even though the latter be playing for the \"State\" championship.<br />\nAt the mass-meeting in the Mechanical Engineering Building<br />\nlast Wednesday noon the speaker<br />\nmentioned my letter in the last<br />\nissue as being \"the second rotten<br />\nknock at our football team\"; the<br />\nfirst being the write-up given<br /><br />\nJack Branham by one of our city<br />\npapers after the Gettysburg game.<br />\nAfter the meeting I conscientipusPrescription Opticians<br />\nly re-read my letter.
