Last year the schools<br />\naccepted more graduate students<br />\nthan usual expecting many to be<br />\ntaken by the draft. With the low<br />\ndraft calls at present, neither the<br />\nschools nor the students know<br />\nwhat to expect in the immediate<br />\nfuture. How do you view this<br />\nsituation?<br />\nHERSHEY - Well, in the first<br />\nplace, I didn't know that last<br />\nspring, when a good many of my<br />\nfriends were prophesizing that<br />\nthere would be nothing but<br />\nwomen and cripples and so forth<br />\nin the graduate schools. I was a<br />\nlittle skeptical about it for a lot of<br />\nreasons.

At<br />\nthe present time it sems that<br />\nthey have a pretty good supply \u2014<br />\nin fact, all the people I've talked<br />\nto, have been talking to me about<br />\nwho are good risks as a graduate<br />\nstudent and you don't ask that<br />\nwhen you don't have a surplus.<br />\nIf you're going to have a<br />\nconflagration (in Vietnam) all the<br />\nschools are going to be in trouble.<br />\nHowever, we don't have<br />\nconflagrations but we don't have<br />\npeace.

In his Monday<br />\nnight address on foreign policy, he committed himself, if elected, to<br />\nhalt the bombing without a prior committment from the North<br />\nVietnamese in the hope that Hanoi would respond favorably. Equally<br />\nimportant, he called for free election in South Vietnam including the<br />\nNational Liberation Front and other dissident groups.<br />\nThis statement makes Humphrey the only major candidate for<br />\nthe Presidency who has spelled out his intentions towards handling<br />\nthe Vietnam War. It is a refreshing change from the multitude of<br />\n\"moratoriums\" imposed by Richard (the new one) Nixon, and the<br />\nsimplistic ravings of Messrs. Agnew and Wallace. For these reasons, we<br />\napplaud the Vice-President.<br />\nHowever, it is not easy to shake all one's reservations about Mr.<br />\nHumphrey's candidacy. His cautious fence-straddling on the Vietnam<br />\nissue, yielding to pressures from President Johnson and peace<br />\nDemocrats, was painfully obvious. It is hard to be certain, even now,<br />\nif Mr. Humphrey will stick to his statement on foreign policy, or if he<br />\nwill gradually edge back to the Administration position when Johnson<br />\nputs the screws on again.<br />\nMoreover, we can well sympathize with former McCarthy and<br />\nKennedy supporters who still cannot, in good conscience, move<br />\ntowards the Vice-President. It is hard to think of the last days of<br />\nRobert Kennedy, the long months of the McCarthy campaign, or the<br />\nugliness of the Democratic Convention and then to turn to Hubert<br />\nHumphrey with open arms.<br />\nYet,the Kennedy and McCarthy people can at least be consoled<br />\nby the fact that their long fight was not a waste of time. Mr.<br />\nHumphrey has practically accepted the plank which theyfought for in<br />\nAugust, and it is doubtful whether he would have done so had they<br />\nnot taken their case through the hectic months of the primary<br />\ncampaigns and to the floor of the convention.<br />\n<br />\nLaugh In<br />\nBefore the festivities begin, we would like to see the Student<br />\nCouncil do some hard thinking about their election procedures.<br />\nThere is still time to make a few badly needed changes before the<br />\nfreshmen elect class officers and representatives to the Council.<br />\nThere are a number of things wrong with the results of all<br />\nCouncil elections which are not entirely the fault of the Council and<br />\nand are not characteristic of Hopkins alone. It is a well-known,<br />\nthough unspoken, fact that Council members are not really representative of anybody but themselves, and the groups of friends they have<br />\nwho are able to elect them due to perenially small turnouts during<br />\nvoting periods. This situation reaches revolting heights when, as<br />\nhappened last year, organizations like fraternities feel it would be<br />\nnice to have a couple of elective offices to put on their mantel like a<br />\ntrophy, and proceed to get all the \"brothers\" out in a similar fashion<br />\nto Mayor Daley stacking the galleries.<br />\nMore relevant to the immediate future is the way elections are<br />\nconducted. If a candidate is elected because someone he knows can<br />\ndraw pretty posters or because he can come up with slogans that<br />\nsucceed in titillating his readers with sophomoric double entendres,<br />\nthen one can rightfully contend that our \"government\" is elected on<br />\nthe basis of dubious merits.<br />\nIf the Council cannot find a better way to select its members, the<br />\nonly alternative is a system which operates at a number of other<br />\nschools \u2014 that of setting up a number of standing committees composed of students who volunteer their services to handle business<br />\naffecting the student body. Such committees are no less receptive to<br />\nstudent opinion than is our present system . .and noticeably more<br />\nefficient.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCT. 4, 1968<br />\n<br />\nHumphrey Hopefully<br />\nBy CHRIS()LANDER<br />\nHubert Humphrey, until Monday night, stumbled along the<br />\ncampaign trail first by proclaiming<br />\nthe \"politics ofjoy and happiness\"<br />\nin a turbulent year, then by clinging to his mentor on the Vietnam<br />\nissue, and finally by following<br />\nNixon into the mire of \"law and<br />\norder.\" To those who do not know<br />\nHumphrey the man or his record,<br />\nit showed him as merely a stooge.<br />\nFor those familiar with the real<br />\nHubert, it seemed like a tragic<br />\ndouble-cross. And of course for<br />\nthe millions of McCarthy enthusiasts, Humphrey's nomination<br />\nturned day into night.<br />\nHumphrey's Monday night<br />\nspeech brings a new hope to the<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nThe speech began with a promise for a basic re-examination of<br />\nour policy in Vietnam. Such a reexamination began with the enlistment of George Ball as chief<br />\nadvisor on foreign affairs. Speaking<br />\nof such new advisors, Humphrey<br />\nstated that, \"it must be their<br />\nresponsibility to make a complete<br />\nreassessment of the situation in<br />\nVietnam-to see where we stand<br />\nand to judge what we must do.\"<br />\nBall, heading this group, recently<br />\nquit a Johnson appointment at the<br />\nU.N. to effect a change of policy<br />\nin Vietnam through Humphrey.<br />\nBall always knew Humphrey's real<br />\nfeelings. Humphrey again reiterated the position that he will not be<br />\nlimited by the policies of his<br />\npredecessor. He stressed that the<br />\nsituation has changed so radically<br />\nin the past several months, that a<br />\nchange in policy is both necessary<br />\nand possible. These changes in<br />\nthemselves have not produced<br />\npeace, but Humphrey is saying<br />\nthat with these events, and a different policy, we can get out. He<br />\nalso sees no reason for any more<br />\nVietnams. \"Other nations of Southeast Asia . . . have strengthened<br />\nthemselves ... and are more able<br />\nto protect \"themselves\" without<br />\nAmerican intervention.\"<br />\nHumphrey's peace proposal<br />\nstarts out with the assertation<br />\nthat he would not withdraw unilaterally or escalate. The latter<br />\npremise has yet to be granted by<br />\nhis opponent.<br />\nNorth Vietnam has stated often<br />\nthat the key to any further progress in the Paris talks centers<br />\naround the bombing halt. Johnson<br />\nhas stated that we continue the<br />\nbombing to protect our troops near<br />\nthe demilitarized zone. Humphrey,<br />\nin effect, repudiates this view by<br />\noffering a complete halt to the<br />\nbombing of the North.<br />\n\"As President, I will stop the<br />\nbombing of the North as an acceptable risk for peace because I<br />\nbelieve it could lead to success in.<br />\nthe negotiations and a shorter war.<br />\nThis would be the best protection<br />\nfor our troops.\" The key to such<br />\na step is the demilitarized zone. If<br />\nthe North Vietnamese, as they<br />\nhave indicated, cease activity in<br />\nthat area in response to the bombing halt, the cease-fire would be<br />\nan easier next step.<br />\nThe next stage of the Humphrey proposal would be a gradual,<br />\nsystematic withdrawal of troops.<br />\n\"I would sit down with the leader<br />\nof South Vietnam to set a specific<br />\ntimetable by which American<br />\nforces could be systematically<br />\nreduced while South Vietnamese<br />\nforces took over more and more<br />\nof the burden.\" Humphrey was<br />\nvague on this subject before,<br />\nprobably because he had no policy<br />\ninto which to incorporate such<br />\na proposal.<br />\nIt is important to note that he<br />\nwants this withdrawal to begin<br />\nimmediately. \"I believe this will<br />\nbe possible next year without<br />\nendangering either our remaining<br />\n<br />\ntroops or the safety of South<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nStep three of the Humphrey<br />\nplan calls for a ceasefire under<br />\ninternational supervision.\"I would<br />\npropose once more an immediate<br />\ncease-fire\u2014with United Nations or<br />\nother international supervision and<br />\nsupervised withdrawal of all foreign forces from South Vietnam.\"<br />\nApart from his promise to end<br />\nthe bombing, Humphrey's most<br />\ndramatic departure from the Johnson war policy concerns free elections. Humphrey makes his most<br />\nsignificant appeal to anti-war forces when he promises free elections<br />\nwith the participation of all dissident factions, including the Viet<br />\nCong.<br />\n\"The Ultimate key... must be<br />\nfree elections in South Vietnam-with all people,including members<br />\nof the National Liberation Front<br />\nand other dissident groups able<br />\nto participate in those elections<br />\n. . . I say: Let the people speak.<br />\nAnd accept their judgement, whatever it is.\" He also emphasizes<br />\nthat until such elections are held,<br />\n<br />\nhe would expect significant political, social and land reform from<br />\nthe present government.<br />\nBeyond the immediate concern<br />\nover Vietnam,Humphrey promises<br />\na re-examination of American<br />\ngoals in the world based not on<br />\nAmerican omnipotence, but on<br />\nAmerican leadership.\"<br />\nThe primary international concern of Mr. Humphrey is the arms<br />\nrace and promises every effort to<br />\nlimit it by: 1) Urging ratification<br />\nof the nonproliferation treaty.<br />\nThis is a vital treaty, the chances<br />\nfor passage of which have been<br />\ndamaged by the political coyness<br />\nof Mr. Nixon. 2) Humphrey sincerely wants to begin the process<br />\nof world disarmanent. \"I shall<br />\ntake the initiative to find the way<br />\n. . . to reduce arms budgets and<br />\nmilitary expenditures systemaiically among all countries of the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nThe importance of this position<br />\ncannot be overestimated. Vietnani<br />\nhas been detrimental in that it has<br />\ntaken the problem of stockpiling<br />\n(Continued on Page 11)<br />\n<br />\n..)\u2022 80481116<br />\n)/(1,r-)<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n00 ,<br />\n,s,<br />\n<br />\n11111111 Adds Ball<br />\nTo Campaign<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nGeorge Ball has done more for<br />\nthe Humphrey campaign than the<br />\n,Vice President has managed to<br />\ndo for himself. Humphrey's<br />\nforeign policy statements are<br />\nalmost certain to gain in<br />\nauthority, since no other<br />\ncandidate in the last twenty years<br />\nhas had an adviser of Ball's<br />\ncredentials.<br />\nThe foreign policy adviser, like<br />\nthe general acceptance of<br />\ninternationalism, is a recent<br />\ndevelopment. Probably the first<br />\nwas John Foster Dulles, one of<br />\nmany Dewey men to switch to<br />\nGeneral Eisenhower for the<br />\ncampaign of 1952. Dulles created<br />\nsome stir in the latter year by<br />\nsuggesting that Eisenhower, if<br />\nelected, would actively seek to<br />\noverthrow the Communist<br />\ngovernments in Eastern Europe.<br />\nThe idea hadn't occurred to<br />\nEisenhower, but he didn't<br />\nrepudiate it, and it may have<br />\nhelped among voters of East<br />\nEuropean extraction.<br />\nIn 1960 Representative Chester<br />\nBowles of Connecticut (later<br />\nAmbassador to India) was the<br />\nadviser to Democratic candidate<br />\nJohn F. Kennedy. Richard Nixon<br />\nannounced that he would rely on<br />\nhis running mate, Henry Cabot<br />\nLodge, the most combative of<br />\n<br />\nAmbassadors to the United<br />\nNations. Actually Lodge's most<br />\nmemorable statement in that<br />\ncampaign was that Nixon, if<br />\nelected, would appoint a Negro to<br />\nthe Cabinet. Supporters of<br />\nSenator Eugene McCarthy, who<br />\nhas characterized the Negro<br />\ncommunity as a colony, might<br />\nagree that Lodge was actuallY<br />\ndealing with external affairs.<br />\nNixon and Goldwater<br />\nWhile Barry Goldwater was,<br />\nbumbling through 1964, he did<br />\nannounce that he would seep<br />\nadvice on foreign policy froni<br />\nNixon, among others. Perhaps he<br />\ndid, and perhaps, as Newsweek<br />\namong others has reported, Nixon<br />\nwas in Goldwater's mind foi<br />\nSecretary of State. But Nixon was<br />\nnot among Goldwater's intimates,<br />\nalthough he did some campaigning<br />\nfor the nominee.<br />\nOf these men, only Dulles had<br />\nexperience in foreign affairs<br />\nchronologically comparable to<br />\nBall's.

What<br />\ndingy<br />\nare the B-25 bases in Catch-22<br />\nsterilized military bases<br />\nwhos chicken<br />\nofficers are trained<br />\nProf essionals rather<br />\nthan,<br />\nmisplaced civilians. The bombers<br />\ntarget lists<br />\nthe whole have been expanded to<br />\nworld, bit by agonizing<br />\nCity.<br />\nSimilarly, home base is now<br />\neverywhere and home base is now<br />\nthe strange<br />\nand hostile country.<br />\nBut the greatest updating<br />\nin<br />\nHeller's play is in the streamlining<br />\nof the<br />\nauthor's sense of the<br />\nabsurd. Where Cath-22 wore long<br />\nand<br />\nleisurely epics of the<br />\nri<br />\ndiculous, We Bombed in New<br />\n11\"en uses a remarkable<br />\necononr..<br />\nY<br />\nThe play is almost a<br />\ncomic review of<br />\nanti-military<br />\nblack humor. As<br />\nsuch, it suggests<br />\nthat Catch<br />\nin tended -22 itself was perhaps<br />\nit were as such an inventory-- if<br />\nnot for the ending of the<br />\n11,Pvel, an ending which brought all<br />\nLae finely woven threads together.<br />\n<br />\nin an almost Dickensonian orgy of<br />\nfinality.<br />\nWe Bombed in New Haven,like<br />\nCatch-22, ends on a tragic note, a<br />\nnote which is perhaps the ultimate<br />\nin updating. While the novel leaves<br />\nus with the protagonist finding his<br />\ntruth in running, the play ends<br />\nfirst with one protagonist(there is<br />\nno Yossarian superman in the<br />\nplay) yielding to man's perpetual<br />\ninstinct to go back and try to<br />\nwork things out (only to die in<br />\nthe present), while another man,<br />\nan older and more stable man, a<br />\nmore tired man, is faced with the<br />\nunavoidability of handing his onus<br />\nof logical death over to the next<br />\ngeneration (dying in the future).<br />\nIt was easy for a young man to<br />\nrun when running was the only<br />\nway to attain the heroic goal of<br />\nstaying alive. It was even easy for<br />\nthe young man to make a human<br />\nmistake and to die. But what can<br />\nthe old man do when he has no<br />\nmistakes left to make, when he<br />\nmust present his offspring with<br />\nthe same morbid inevitabilities<br />\nthat shaped his life?<br />\n\"How can I be a father,\" says<br />\nthe father, \"so soon?\"<br />\nBut \"so soon\" is upon Heller<br />\nand the thought frightens him.<br />\nPerhaps this in some part explains<br />\nthe\\ amount of attention paid to<br />\nthe actors' interaction with the<br />\naudience. For if there is any one<br />\nvalid criticism of Catch-22 it is<br />\nthat the book is far away from its<br />\naudience, too prone to being<br />\nsomeone else's funny story. In the<br />\nplay, the actors present<br />\nthemselves as actors playing parts<br />\nfor you, the audience. Heller<br />\ninstructs the actors to make<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\ncontemporary references,<br />\nwherever and whenever the play is<br />\nperformed and never to forget or<br />\nlet the audience forget that they<br />\nare on the real stage before the<br />\nreal people in the real seats. When<br />\nHenderson, the young Yossarian<br />\nimitation dies, he dies first as a<br />\ncharacter, then as the actor who<br />\npreviously presented the audience<br />\nwith his real life name. Heller does<br />\neverything short of using (in the<br />\nold Greek manner) condemned<br />\ncriminals for real slaughter on<br />\nstage in his determination to bring<br />\nthe Catch-22 down into first row<br />\ncenter.<br />\nIf we are all a part of the<br />\ncatch-22 it is because we have<br />\nnever left that safe, absurd way of<br />\nthinking symbolized by the<br />\nofficer demanding the private in<br />\nfront of his nose to formalize his<br />\nexistence with a loud \"here, sir\".<br />\nWe are all in the catch-22 not<br />\nbecause the World War II<br />\nblindness never ended, not<br />\nbecause the military has come to<br />\nus with respectable attache case,<br />\nbut because we still live in blissful<br />\ncohabitation with our acceptance<br />\nof death and the horrible logic of<br />\ndeath arranged for us by someone<br />\nelse.<br />\nThus, there is nothing new said<br />\nin We Bombed in New Haven. But<br />\nwhat has been said before is being<br />\nsaid directly to us, to us loudly<br />\nbecause we still mire ourselves in<br />\nthe inevitability of our own<br />\nslaughter. And that catch-22 has<br />\nstill to be repeated, repeated<br />\nloudly and screamed in the<br />\ndarkness, this perhaps, is the<br />\nheight of Heller's black humor.<br />\n<br />\nfilms, though equally as erotic as<br />\n\"Mondo Nympho\"-type films, are<br />\ngiven enough respectability by the<br />\nhigh quality of their production<br />\nto be admitted to the lofty<br />\nplateau of the Fellini-BergmanAntonioni circuit. Now, thanks to<br />\nMetzger, the intelligentisia can get<br />\nits dirt without embarrassment.<br />\nMetzger, in my mind, is the Hugh<br />\nHefner of cinema. Just as we use<br />\nPlayboy's interview with the Rev.<br />\nSloane Coffin as a rationalization<br />\nto look at the fold-out, so we use<br />\nMetzger's high quality of<br />\nproduction as a rationalization to<br />\nlook at a bunch of nude scenes.<br />\nGreat Expectations<br />\nTo say I expected a real sizzler<br />\nwould be an understatement.<br />\nMany things created the great<br />\nexpectations I had for the film,<br />\nnot the least of which were all<br />\nthose Baltimore Lesbians<br />\ncrowding in front of the theater.<br />\nDuring the first hour the eager<br />\naudience was treated to nothing<br />\nmore than an older Therese<br />\nwandering around her old school<br />\nhaving flashbacks of her life with<br />\nIsabelle. As of the first hour, there<br />\nwas no big sex scenes, unless you<br />\nconsider reading Beaudelaire to<br />\neach other and holding hands as<br />\nhot stuff. The disgruntled<br />\naudience began to get restless and<br />\ncomments like, \"I spent $2.50 to<br />\nwatch two dikes hold hands?\"<br />\nwere heard.<br />\nYet those familiar with the<br />\nways of the arty skin-flick knew<br />\nthat Metzger was leading the<br />\naudience on to some real big<br />\nscenes. Sure enough, the first sex<br />\nscene came along and the<br />\naudience leaned forward<br />\nexpectantly. This is it! Therese is<br />\nin bed. The clock reads four<br />\no'clock. She can't sleep. Slowly<br />\nshe slips her hand under her<br />\nbedsheet, and the camera follows<br />\nher hand as it glides down her<br />\nbody. The camera pans up to<br />\nTherese's face. She begins to roll<br />\nher eyes, and breathe heavily. She<br />\nis moaning, moving her sweaty<br />\nface from side to side, her mouth<br />\npalpitating. She writhes and<br />\nmoans in this manner for another<br />\nfive minutes, with the camera<br />\nnever moving from her contorted<br />\nface. This is a sex scene? Forget it.<br />\nIt is around as sexy as an<br />\nastronauts's face being contorted<br />\nby atmospheric pressure or a<br />\nperson having an epileptic fit.<br />\nWith a few angry comments<br />\nthe audience sits back, mulling<br />\nover what they missed that<br />\nevening to see some idiot girl<br />\nbreathing heavily. They murmur<br />\namong themselves waiting for Sex<br />\nScene Number Two. When Sex<br />\n<br />\nScene Number Two approaches,<br />\nthe audience once again leans<br />\nforward hopefully. Therese has<br />\nentered Isabelle's room and they<br />\nhave taken off their nightgowns<br />\nand we get a quick glimpse of<br />\ntheir naked bodies. Whoopeedo!<br />\nTherese lies down on the bed and<br />\n_Isabelle commences an interesting<br />\nform of dalliance. But once more<br />\nthe camera zooms in on Therese's<br />\nface and we get another closeup<br />\nof Therese's face turning from one<br />\nside to another, moaning, etc. As<br />\nif that wasn't enough, Metzger<br />\nadds insult to injury by having<br />\nViolet te Leduc's effusive and<br />\nmawkish prose voiced over<br />\nTherese's panting face. Leduc's<br />\nwriting is filled with lush, trite<br />\nmetaphors, as if a thirteen year<br />\nold school girl, fed on True Romance comic books decided to<br />\nwrite a pornographic novel. Here<br />\nis a sample of the kind of junk<br />\nLeduc writes: \"Her probing fingers<br />\ncrushed my entrails, sending<br />\nflames of ecstasy up my flesh.<br />\nYes, I was transformed by love,<br />\nmy entire being throbbing with<br />\nexcitement.\" The language, too,<br />\nquite obviously fails as<br />\npornography, or as anything else<br />\nfor that matter.<br />\nResentful, realizing that it had<br />\nbeen conned, the audience began<br />\nto laugh at the absurdness of the<br />\nfilm\u2014there was simply nothing<br />\nelse for it to do. Only the<br />\n}possibility that the movie might<br />\ncontain a good pornographic<br />\nscene kept people there until the<br />\nlast reel. But that scene never<br />\ncame\u2014only closeups of Therese or<br />\nIsabelle sweating and moaning.<br />\nThen gratefully, it was over.<br />\nMetzger, no doubt, will make a<br />\nmillion.<br />\nTHE HAPPENING<br />\nThe Student Council, in an<br />\neffort to involve all of the faculty, administration and students<br />\nin an informal non-classroom<br />\ntype of meeting, is bringing<br />\nforth a Hopkins Happening next<br />\nweek on the Soccer Field immediately following the F&M<br />\nfootball game.<br />\nAll members of the faculty<br />\nreceived individual personal invitations to the affair which includes an all-you-can-eat-picnic<br />\n-style barbecue followed by a<br />\nconcert by guitarist Charlie<br />\nByrd.<br />\nPrices for both barbecue and<br />\nconcert are $2.50 single and<br />\n$4.00 couple.<br />\n* * * * * * * *<br />\n<br />\n* * * * *<br />\n<br />\nHIM Adds Ball<br />\nTo Campaign<br />\n(Continued from Page 6)<br />\n<br />\nBall's influence on Humphrey's<br />\nVietnam position is at this point a<br />\nmatter of conjecture.

It has been<br />\nsuggested by more than one<br />\ncolumnist that the reason for the<br />\nlow draft calls which started last<br />\nspring and which many predict<br />\nwill rise again after the elections,<br />\nis the presidential election. What<br />\nis your view?<br />\nHERSHEY- I don't know. In the<br />\nfirst place, I'm not a politician<br />\nthough I've been accused of it<br />\nonce or twice. There was that kid<br />\nwho came to my press conference<br />\nin the summertime that did that.<br />\nHe was the one that got rue mixed<br />\nup with Wallace, but I don't mind.<br />\nHe was from the University of<br />\nWyoming, and working for the<br />\nsummer, and I did try to say that<br />\nhe misinterpreted me.<br />\n_<br />\nI do think you might try to<br />\nthink of this a little bit. There's<br />\nbeen somewhere around 60,000<br />\nto 80,000 National Guard<br />\nreservists called. I think if you will<br />\nadd the last six months and set it<br />\noff against what we might have<br />\nhad, you might find that 60,000<br />\nor so is somewhere near the<br />\ndifference, (meaning that the<br />\nreservists displaced the usual<br />\namount of draftees - Ed.)<br />\nI wished I knew more about<br />\nhow we get these calls anyway.<br />\nOne of my problems has been<br />\ntrying to get them early enough.<br />\nIn the last 36 months, the calls<br />\nhave been anywhere from 15 to<br />\n45 days late. I think part of it is<br />\nthe machine world. We have to<br />\novershoot our calls all the time in<br />\norder to come up to where we're<br />\nsupposed to.<br />\nN-L- In other words, if this was a<br />\npolitical manuever, it was<br />\naccomplished by calling up the<br />\nNational Guard instead of<br />\ninducting people through the<br />\nSelective Service?<br />\nHERSHEY - Let's get straight<br />\nabout two or three things. The<br />\nCongress passes the law. The<br />\nquestion of acceptability is in the<br />\nArmed Forces, and also numbers,<br />\nwe haven't anything to do with<br />\nnumbers. The only thing we<br />\ndecide is when the individual goes.<br />\nThe liability is based on Congress<br />\nand the calls on the Armed Forces<br />\nwithin the limits that congress has<br />\ngiven them money to have people.<br />\nAnd I read time and time and<br />\ntime and time again in the press \u2014<br />\nnot the college press, I don't have<br />\na very good cutting service on that<br />\n\u2014 that the Director of Selective<br />\nService notified the local boards<br />\nthat there would be no more<br />\ndeferments for graduate students.<br />\nAnd that's true.

What about the alleged<br />\nlack of uniforni guidelines to<br />\ngovern local boards?<br />\nHERSHEY- Well, that's a good<br />\nquestion, but offhand what do<br />\nyou mean by a uniform guideline?<br />\nThere's been a lot of talk, but not<br />\n<br />\na lot of things said. They talk<br />\nabout guidelines, they talk about<br />\nnational pools, they talk about a<br />\nlot of things, but they don't say<br />\nanything about them because in<br />\nthe first place most of them don't<br />\nknow what they're talking about.<br />\n1 think I've been around quite<br />\nawhile.<br />\nThis morning I asked my staff,<br />\nwhat do you think a national pool<br />\nis? What's a guideline? Well, in the<br />\nfirst place, all boys are liable<br />\nbetween ages 18 and 35, is a<br />\nguideline. It's in the law. Some<br />\npeople say take the younger kids<br />\nfirst. That's a guideline.

What to preach. But in Utah and<br />\ndid the Congress do? Congress Eastern California they let the<br />\nsaid that if the President wanted twenty year olds do this. When I<br />\nto take 19 year olds he could do was in Georgia, I was checking up<br />\nit. He delegated that to the on this case and the Georgia board<br />\nSecretary of Defense. He's had it told me that the kid had gone to<br />\nfor over a year. Have we had any Utah where he got a mission and a<br />\ncalls for 19 year olds? We have minister's deferment.

When they<br />\ncome and sit in my office here<br />\nand not let me work for a week or<br />\ntwo, then I think they're violating<br />\nthe law and I thing they are doing<br />\nsomething which is not in the<br />\nnational interest and therefore<br />\nthey can't be deferred.

With<br />\nactions like draft card turn-ins<br />\nbecoming more frequent, has your<br />\noperations been set back at all?<br />\nHERSHEY - Well, it set us back in<br />\nthe sense that it takes time.<br />\nWhether you reclassify them or<br />\nprosecute them, it takes a lot of<br />\ntime because you have to send<br />\none of your clerks with the<br />\nrecords and so forth.

As a result, the headline<br />\nand the first few paragraphs of<br />\nyour front page story on this<br />\nsubject on September 27 give a<br />\nquite misleading impression, both<br />\nof my personal views and of<br />\nUniversity policy on this matter.<br />\nIn the first part of lhe<br />\ninterview, we reviewed together<br />\nthe content of the Higher<br />\nEducation Bill on this point. The<br />\nSenate version (the latest available<br />\nat the time of the interview)<br />\nprovided for the cutting off of<br />\nfederal financial aid to students<br />\nunder two circumstances: (a)<br />\nwhen a University finds that a<br />\nstudent has been convicted by a<br />\ncourt of certain types of stated<br />\ndisruptive activities, or(b) when a<br />\nUniversity finds that a student has<br />\n\"willfully refused to obey a lawful<br />\nregulation or order of such<br />\ninstitution and that such refusal<br />\nwas of a serious nature and<br />\ncontributed to the disruption of<br />\nthe administration of such<br />\ninstitution.\" I pointed out that<br />\nthis version was substantially<br />\nbetter than the mandatory cut off<br />\nprovisions passed last spring by<br />\nthe House of Representatives,<br />\nagainst which strong objection<br />\n<br />\nINC.<br />\n<br />\nwas made by me and many other<br />\nuniversity presidents.<br />\nMr. Hoelscher then asked<br />\nwhether the University had<br />\nestablished guidelines for defining<br />\n\"serious disruption\". I stated that<br />\nwe had not, and that the whole<br />\nquestion of procedures for<br />\nstudent conduct and discipline<br />\nwas under review and would be<br />\ndiscussed in coming months<br />\namong representative bodies of<br />\nfaculty, students, and<br />\nadministration. In response to the<br />\nquestion of whether I had<br />\npersonally in mind some<br />\ndefinition of \"serious disruption,\"<br />\nI replied that last April and May's<br />\nevents at Columbia suggested<br />\nsome activities that would seem to<br />\nmeet the definition.<br />\n<br />\nEvidently the question of how<br />\nto act under the terms of the new<br />\nhigher education legislation is one<br />\nof the matters which must be<br />\nconsidered in working out<br />\nUniversity policies and procedures<br />\non student conduct.

Over the years, in one<br />\nWay or another, Mr. Nixon has<br />\nindicated the necessity for escalating the war. In January Mr. Nixon<br />\nstated that the ideas of free elections in South Vietnam was merely<br />\n\"bunk.\" In February, Nixon said<br />\nthat a general \"has to take the<br />\nposition that he cannot rule out<br />\nthe use of nuclear weapons in extreme situations that might<br />\ndevelop.\"<br />\n<br />\nwrong nerve. This is Humphrey's<br />\nremark that a democratic South<br />\nVietnam has been in our national<br />\ninterest. This was the main contention of the opponents of the<br />\nwar from the beginning: that such<br />\nis not the case. It still isn't. For<br />\nif one admits the initial commitment as a mistake, none of the<br />\nensuing trashy policy makes sense.<br />\nWe cannot defend every country<br />\nthat is threatened by an idealogical<br />\nmovement. Humphrey admits this<br />\nin his speech, but does not see the<br />\ndifference between this overall<br />\npolicy framework and the particularity of our policy in Vietnam.<br />\nThe primary importance of this<br />\nspeech is that Humphrey has<br />\naccepted the McCarthy position<br />\nof Vietnam, and the underlying<br />\nassumption motivating it, without<br />\nthe irrationality of some of that<br />\nposition. But this irrationality<br />\nwas motivated by a desire to bait<br />\nHumphrey at the convention.<br />\n<br />\nMr.-Nixon opposed the test ban<br />\ntreaty and called it a \"cruel hoax.\"<br />\nHumphrey is now speaking<br />\nHe now opposes any form of arms honestly and for himself.

He speaks<br />\nwith nostalgia, \"Students have changed. Today they are less willing to<br />\naccept discipline and rules and regulations for the good of the community. It's not showing individualism by breaking laws and interfering with others.\"<br />\nTurnerian Thesis<br />\nLike most educators Mr. Turner is rather concerned with student<br />\ndiscontent and violent revolt. \"The old theory was that kids are kids<br />\nand to let them let off steam. Yet of late they have pushed too far.<br />\nSchools with the least trouble were those who acted with necessary<br />\nforce in the beginning.

The danger is from extremists at all ends, and the<br />\nlarge middle group says little.\"<br />\nSports provides the great analogy. \"Through sports one can show<br />\nhis individuality instead of objecting to the general order.\" He emphasized sports' proverbial virtue that all play by the rules. \"No matter<br />\nhow much a bad cal( hurts it's still better to have a game than no game<br />\nat all.

Educators<br />\nmust find the right kind of challenges . . . beyond the self . . . cause<br />\nkids are basically good. The rioters are just misdirected talent.\"<br />\nCandidly, Hopkins bears a great burden of the guilt. \"Hopkins is<br />\ntraditionally too academic and there is not enough attention given to<br />\nnon-academic areas. The most unfortunate aspect is that the teachers<br />\nplace too much emphasis on their own research and graduate students.<br />\nThe result is that the undergrads are left to fend for themselves.\"<br />\nParticipating in one of Snack Bar Mary's BLT's, Turner continued,<br />\n\"However, this University is not so stiff and stereotyped that the kids<br />\ncan't work out programs with the administration.

There are, of<br />\ncourse, many reasons why one<br />\nshould try out for a sport ranging<br />\nfrom a convenient way to release<br />\none's aggressions to an excellent<br />\nsource of self-discipline, Yet,when<br />\nfootball players are asked what<br />\nthey most dislike about Hopkins<br />\nfootball it is that no one watches<br />\nthem - or, perhaps more honestly,<br />\nthat no one watches them because<br />\nevery one has better things to do<br />\nand besides, the team is just a lot<br />\nof dumb football players.<br />\nTo be sure, any one who writes<br />\noff the team as a group of individually worthless people is himself guilty of a very serious bias.<br />\nThere are people like Phil Shrodel<br />\nand Willie Scroggs who went out<br />\nin their Junior year not to have<br />\nfun, but because they felt that<br />\nthey owed it to the school not to<br />\ndesert a loser.

Last year the schools<br />\naccepted more graduate students<br />\nthan usual expecting many to be<br />\ntaken by the draft. With the low<br />\ndraft calls at present, neither the<br />\nschools nor the students know<br />\nwhat to expect in the immediate<br />\nfuture. How do you view this<br />\nsituation?<br />\nHERSHEY - Well, in the first<br />\nplace, I didn't know that last<br />\nspring, when a good many of my<br />\nfriends were prophesizing that<br />\nthere would be nothing but<br />\nwomen and cripples and so forth<br />\nin the graduate schools. I was a<br />\nlittle skeptical about it for a lot of<br />\nreasons. I don't think they're out<br />\nof the woods now - I don't want<br />\nto start gloating because of the<br />\nfact that they did have a ten or<br />\nfifteen percent increase\u2014 I don't<br />\nwant to gloat about it because,<br />\nwho knows?<br />\nIf you could have something<br />\nwhich could terminate the armed<br />\nforces, or the Vietnam thing, you<br />\nare going to have an even greater<br />\ninflux.<br />\nTherefore, I think it depends a<br />\ngreat deal on what happens. At<br />\nthe present time it sems that<br />\nthey have a pretty good supply \u2014<br />\nin fact, all the people I've talked<br />\nto, have been talking to me about<br />\nwho are good risks as a graduate<br />\nstudent and you don't ask that<br />\nwhen you don't have a surplus.<br />\nIf you're going to have a<br />\nconflagration (in Vietnam) all the<br />\nschools are going to be in trouble.<br />\nHowever, we don't have<br />\nconflagrations but we don't have<br />\npeace. When you are in that sort<br />\nof thing \u2014 half of this and half of<br />\nthat \u2014 it's a little hard to predict.<br />\nN-L- What I was getting at is that<br />\nthe schools do have a surplus but<br />\nthat is what the problem is. Was<br />\ntheir a miscalculation in the<br />\nmaking of this law which caused<br />\nthe schools to over-accept'?<br />\nHERSHEY - Well, in the first<br />\nplace,.

There<br />\nisn't. You don't know whether<br />\nyou are going to get across one of<br />\nthese streets down here. Cars kill<br />\nmore people everyday than the<br />\nIndians ever did kill.<br /><br />\nto Congress, and Congress said<br />\n'All right, brothers, you've thrown<br />\nit up to us and we'll just throw it<br />\nback at you.' So they said there'll<br />\nbe no graduate deferments unless<br />\notherwise indicated by the<br />\nNational Security Council. They<br />\nleft it right on the President again<br />\nbecause he's the head of the<br />\nNational Security Council.<br />\nGeneral Clark recommended<br />\nthat a committee be set up to<br />\ndecide what graduates should be<br />\ndeferred and what graduates<br />\nshouldn't. But it (the committee)<br />\nwas to operate under the National<br />\nSecurity Council. But the<br />\nCongress said it 'got too many<br />\ncommittees around here anyway.'<br />\nSo they knocked out the<br />\nCommittee and threw it back on<br />\nthe National Security Council<br />\nwhich is the last place you throw<br />\nanything. They're not an<br />\noperating outfit, they're a big<br />\npolicy thing. That left them in an<br />\nodd thing.<br />\nNow I know a little about this<br />\nbecause between 1948 and 1952,<br />\nI had a committee around here of<br />\nabout 30 .people. How are you<br />\ngoing to decide who you defer in<br />\nthe graduate field? Are you going<br />\nto decide it on the basis of wl:at.<br />\nthey are studying?<br />\nYou know where you liberal<br />\narts people are going to be if you<br />\ndo that because....well, I have<br />\nsympathy with the liberal arts<br />\nbecause remember I think that<br />\nunless somebody knows hor\u2022 td<br />\nrun the world, these scientist., God knows<br />\nyou can't depohd<br />\non them.<br />\nWell, if you don't take<br />\ngraduate students by fields !! en<br />\n... ....<br />\n44410.ge.4). .<br /><br />\nSo therefore, the certainty business I won't argue about, because<br />\nyou are completely right. There is<br />\nuncertainty.<br />\nN-L - Do you believe that this<br />\nCongressional reaction to college<br />\ndisturbances was part of the reason responsible for the 1967 draft<br />\nlaw that was so tough on grad<br />\nstudents?<br />\nIIERSHEY- Well, probably. That's<br />\na good one. I wish somebody<br />\nwould tell me what happened. It<br />\nisn't logical.<br />\nYou did have some confusion<br />\namong the educators. On the<br />\nother hand, there were a lot of<br />\npeople yelling around that you<br />\nought to cut off all deferments.<br />\nThis didn't come from the<br />\nnon-college people who have<br />\nalways been hollering. I'm talking<br />\nabout the guys who come from<br />\nour big name institutions. That's<br />\none of the unfortunate parts<br />\nabout it. There are 3,000<br />\npresidents in this country. You<br />\neither don't hear anything out of<br />\nthem or you hear the wrong thing.<br />\nYou don't hear anything out of<br />\nmost of them.<br />\nThere was a lot of noise made<br />\nwhen Burke Marshall came along<br />\nand said 'Cut out all deferments.'<br />\nThe Congress did not buy the<br />\nMarshall report at all. But there<br />\nwere people who kept talking<br />\nabout \"pyramiding\" which I regretted a great deal. (Ed. note:<br />\n\"pyramiding\" meaning the use of<br />\nundergraduate and graduate studj.<br />\nto evade the draft).<br />\nI do think that whenever you<br />\nhave anything to eat, you also<br />\nhave company. What I mean is<br />\nthat there are a lot of schools who<br />\ne\u2022\u2014\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nhave gone into the graduate<br />\nschool to get graduate assistants<br />\nto do some cheap teaching. I'm<br />\nnot being critical at all, but it<br />\nhappens to be fact. Therefore, we<br />\nhad people trying to get masters<br />\ndegrees, who really had \u2022 no<br />\nbusiness being there, but you<br />\ncould use them for research and get<br />\nsome grants out of the federal<br />\ngovernment. You could use them<br />\nfor graduate assistants on<br />\nteaching\u2014what I call slave labor.<br />\nOne of the things that got<br />\npeople's ire up was to see the<br />\npeople crowding in. Now, the<br />\nschools that have been in the<br />\ngraduate business a long time, it<br />\nwas quite another matter for<br />\nthem. It was true, that if you took<br />\na hundred people, a percentage of<br />\nthem were probably there for the<br />\nride.<br />\nIt was true that the Burke<br />\nMarshall people recommended<br />\nthat you cut out all deferments.<br />\nThe President never went that far.<br />\nHe went along originally on the<br />\ngraduate schools, and it got over<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNEWSLETTER<br /><br />\nH(<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCT. 4,196<br /><br />\nBlack Student Union Demands Change<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br /><br />\nand \"Welfare Mothers Rescuers<br />\nfrom Poverty\".

The Black<br />\nUnion hopes to bridge the gap<br />\nwhich has suddenly become very<br />\nimportant. \"Hopefully blacks will<br />\nbe able to participate in Hopkins<br />\nas a black student.\"<br />\nIn order to begin to regulate<br />\nthe Black Union, Guess and Baker<br />\noffered the administration several<br />\nsuggestions vital to the Union's<br /><br />\npurpose.<br />\nThe most important point was<br />\nthe need for greater numbers of<br />\nblack students enrolled in the<br />\nschool.<br />\n\"Without this,\" he said, \"we<br />\ncan do very little as a group at<br />\nHopkins.\"<br />\nThe second two points, which<br />\nwere closely related, called for<br />\nboth a section in the library<br />\ndevoted to black authors and for<br />\nthe inclusion of black history<br />\ncourses in the curriculum.

In his Monday<br />\nnight address on foreign policy, he committed himself, if elected, to<br />\nhalt the bombing without a prior committment from the North<br />\nVietnamese in the hope that Hanoi would respond favorably. Equally<br />\nimportant, he called for free election in South Vietnam including the<br />\nNational Liberation Front and other dissident groups.<br />\nThis statement makes Humphrey the only major candidate for<br />\nthe Presidency who has spelled out his intentions towards handling<br />\nthe Vietnam War. It is a refreshing change from the multitude of<br />\n\"moratoriums\" imposed by Richard (the new one) Nixon, and the<br />\nsimplistic ravings of Messrs. Agnew and Wallace. For these reasons, we<br />\napplaud the Vice-President.<br />\nHowever, it is not easy to shake all one's reservations about Mr.<br />\nHumphrey's candidacy. His cautious fence-straddling on the Vietnam<br />\nissue, yielding to pressures from President Johnson and peace<br />\nDemocrats, was painfully obvious. It is hard to be certain, even now,<br />\nif Mr. Humphrey will stick to his statement on foreign policy, or if he<br />\nwill gradually edge back to the Administration position when Johnson<br />\nputs the screws on again.<br />\nMoreover, we can well sympathize with former McCarthy and<br />\nKennedy supporters who still cannot, in good conscience, move<br />\ntowards the Vice-President. It is hard to think of the last days of<br />\nRobert Kennedy, the long months of the McCarthy campaign, or the<br />\nugliness of the Democratic Convention and then to turn to Hubert<br />\nHumphrey with open arms.<br />\nYet,the Kennedy and McCarthy people can at least be consoled<br />\nby the fact that their long fight was not a waste of time. Mr.<br />\nHumphrey has practically accepted the plank which theyfought for in<br />\nAugust, and it is doubtful whether he would have done so had they<br />\nnot taken their case through the hectic months of the primary<br />\ncampaigns and to the floor of the convention.<br /><br />\nLaugh In<br />\nBefore the festivities begin, we would like to see the Student<br />\nCouncil do some hard thinking about their election procedures.<br />\nThere is still time to make a few badly needed changes before the<br />\nfreshmen elect class officers and representatives to the Council.<br />\nThere are a number of things wrong with the results of all<br />\nCouncil elections which are not entirely the fault of the Council and<br />\nand are not characteristic of Hopkins alone. It is a well-known,<br />\nthough unspoken, fact that Council members are not really representative of anybody but themselves, and the groups of friends they have<br />\nwho are able to elect them due to perenially small turnouts during<br />\nvoting periods. This situation reaches revolting heights when, as<br />\nhappened last year, organizations like fraternities feel it would be<br />\nnice to have a couple of elective offices to put on their mantel like a<br />\ntrophy, and proceed to get all the \"brothers\" out in a similar fashion<br />\nto Mayor Daley stacking the galleries.<br />\nMore relevant to the immediate future is the way elections are<br />\nconducted. If a candidate is elected because someone he knows can<br />\ndraw pretty posters or because he can come up with slogans that<br />\nsucceed in titillating his readers with sophomoric double entendres,<br />\nthen one can rightfully contend that our \"government\" is elected on<br />\nthe basis of dubious merits.<br />\nIf the Council cannot find a better way to select its members, the<br />\nonly alternative is a system which operates at a number of other<br />\nschools \u2014 that of setting up a number of standing committees composed of students who volunteer their services to handle business<br />\naffecting the student body. Such committees are no less receptive to<br />\nstudent opinion than is our present system . .and noticeably more<br />\nefficient.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE,OCT. 4, 1968<br /><br />\nHumphrey Hopefully<br />\nBy CHRIS()LANDER<br />\nHubert Humphrey, until Monday night, stumbled along the<br />\ncampaign trail first by proclaiming<br />\nthe \"politics ofjoy and happiness\"<br />\nin a turbulent year, then by clinging to his mentor on the Vietnam<br />\nissue, and finally by following<br />\nNixon into the mire of \"law and<br />\norder.\" To those who do not know<br />\nHumphrey the man or his record,<br />\nit showed him as merely a stooge.<br />\nFor those familiar with the real<br />\nHubert, it seemed like a tragic<br />\ndouble-cross. And of course for<br />\nthe millions of McCarthy enthusiasts, Humphrey's nomination<br />\nturned day into night.<br />\nHumphrey's Monday night<br />\nspeech brings a new hope to the<br />\ncampaign.<br />\nThe speech began with a promise for a basic re-examination of<br />\nour policy in Vietnam. Such a reexamination began with the enlistment of George Ball as chief<br />\nadvisor on foreign affairs. Speaking<br />\nof such new advisors, Humphrey<br />\nstated that, \"it must be their<br />\nresponsibility to make a complete<br />\nreassessment of the situation in<br />\nVietnam-to see where we stand<br />\nand to judge what we must do.\"<br />\nBall, heading this group, recently<br />\nquit a Johnson appointment at the<br />\nU.N. to effect a change of policy<br />\nin Vietnam through Humphrey.<br />\nBall always knew Humphrey's real<br />\nfeelings. Humphrey again reiterated the position that he will not be<br />\nlimited by the policies of his<br />\npredecessor. He stressed that the<br />\nsituation has changed so radically<br />\nin the past several months, that a<br />\nchange in policy is both necessary<br />\nand possible. These changes in<br />\nthemselves have not produced<br />\npeace, but Humphrey is saying<br />\nthat with these events, and a different policy, we can get out. He<br />\nalso sees no reason for any more<br />\nVietnams. \"Other nations of Southeast Asia . . . have strengthened<br />\nthemselves ... and are more able<br />\nto protect \"themselves\" without<br />\nAmerican intervention.\"<br />\nHumphrey's peace proposal<br />\nstarts out with the assertation<br />\nthat he would not withdraw unilaterally or escalate. The latter<br />\npremise has yet to be granted by<br />\nhis opponent.<br />\nNorth Vietnam has stated often<br />\nthat the key to any further progress in the Paris talks centers<br />\naround the bombing halt. Johnson<br />\nhas stated that we continue the<br />\nbombing to protect our troops near<br />\nthe demilitarized zone. Humphrey,<br />\nin effect, repudiates this view by<br />\noffering a complete halt to the<br />\nbombing of the North.<br />\n\"As President, I will stop the<br />\nbombing of the North as an acceptable risk for peace because I<br />\nbelieve it could lead to success in.<br />\nthe negotiations and a shorter war.<br />\nThis would be the best protection<br />\nfor our troops.\" The key to such<br />\na step is the demilitarized zone. If<br />\nthe North Vietnamese, as they<br />\nhave indicated, cease activity in<br />\nthat area in response to the bombing halt, the cease-fire would be<br />\nan easier next step.<br />\nThe next stage of the Humphrey proposal would be a gradual,<br />\nsystematic withdrawal of troops.<br />\n\"I would sit down with the leader<br />\nof South Vietnam to set a specific<br />\ntimetable by which American<br />\nforces could be systematically<br />\nreduced while South Vietnamese<br />\nforces took over more and more<br />\nof the burden.\" Humphrey was<br />\nvague on this subject before,<br />\nprobably because he had no policy<br />\ninto which to incorporate such<br />\na proposal.<br />\nIt is important to note that he<br />\nwants this withdrawal to begin<br />\nimmediately. \"I believe this will<br />\nbe possible next year without<br />\nendangering either our remaining<br /><br />\ntroops or the safety of South<br />\nVietnam.<br />\nStep three of the Humphrey<br />\nplan calls for a ceasefire under<br />\ninternational supervision.\"I would<br />\npropose once more an immediate<br />\ncease-fire\u2014with United Nations or<br />\nother international supervision and<br />\nsupervised withdrawal of all foreign forces from South Vietnam.\"<br />\nApart from his promise to end<br />\nthe bombing, Humphrey's most<br />\ndramatic departure from the Johnson war policy concerns free elections. Humphrey makes his most<br />\nsignificant appeal to anti-war forces when he promises free elections<br />\nwith the participation of all dissident factions, including the Viet<br />\nCong.<br />\n\"The Ultimate key... must be<br />\nfree elections in South Vietnam-with all people,including members<br />\nof the National Liberation Front<br />\nand other dissident groups able<br />\nto participate in those elections<br />\n. . . I say: Let the people speak.<br />\nAnd accept their judgement, whatever it is.\" He also emphasizes<br />\nthat until such elections are held,<br /><br />\nhe would expect significant political, social and land reform from<br />\nthe present government.<br />\nBeyond the immediate concern<br />\nover Vietnam,Humphrey promises<br />\na re-examination of American<br />\ngoals in the world based not on<br />\nAmerican omnipotence, but on<br />\nAmerican leadership.\"<br />\nThe primary international concern of Mr. Humphrey is the arms<br />\nrace and promises every effort to<br />\nlimit it by: 1) Urging ratification<br />\nof the nonproliferation treaty.<br />\nThis is a vital treaty, the chances<br />\nfor passage of which have been<br />\ndamaged by the political coyness<br />\nof Mr. Nixon. 2) Humphrey sincerely wants to begin the process<br />\nof world disarmanent. \"I shall<br />\ntake the initiative to find the way<br />\n. . . to reduce arms budgets and<br />\nmilitary expenditures systemaiically among all countries of the<br />\nworld.\"<br />\nThe importance of this position<br />\ncannot be overestimated. Vietnani<br />\nhas been detrimental in that it has<br />\ntaken the problem of stockpiling<br />\n(Continued on Page 11)<br /><br />\n..)\u2022 80481116<br />\n)/(1,r-)<br />\n0<br /><br />\n00 ,<br />\n,s,<br /><br />\n11111111 Adds Ball<br />\nTo Campaign<br />\nBy ED MENDELSOHN<br />\nGeorge Ball has done more for<br />\nthe Humphrey campaign than the<br />\n,Vice President has managed to<br />\ndo for himself. Humphrey's<br />\nforeign policy statements are<br />\nalmost certain to gain in<br />\nauthority, since no other<br />\ncandidate in the last twenty years<br />\nhas had an adviser of Ball's<br />\ncredentials.<br />\nThe foreign policy adviser, like<br />\nthe general acceptance of<br />\ninternationalism, is a recent<br />\ndevelopment. Probably the first<br />\nwas John Foster Dulles, one of<br />\nmany Dewey men to switch to<br />\nGeneral Eisenhower for the<br />\ncampaign of 1952. Dulles created<br />\nsome stir in the latter year by<br />\nsuggesting that Eisenhower, if<br />\nelected, would actively seek to<br />\noverthrow the Communist<br />\ngovernments in Eastern Europe.<br />\nThe idea hadn't occurred to<br />\nEisenhower, but he didn't<br />\nrepudiate it, and it may have<br />\nhelped among voters of East<br />\nEuropean extraction.<br />\nIn 1960 Representative Chester<br />\nBowles of Connecticut (later<br />\nAmbassador to India) was the<br />\nadviser to Democratic candidate<br />\nJohn F. Kennedy. Richard Nixon<br />\nannounced that he would rely on<br />\nhis running mate, Henry Cabot<br />\nLodge, the most combative of<br /><br />\nAmbassadors to the United<br />\nNations. Actually Lodge's most<br />\nmemorable statement in that<br />\ncampaign was that Nixon, if<br />\nelected, would appoint a Negro to<br />\nthe Cabinet. Supporters of<br />\nSenator Eugene McCarthy, who<br />\nhas characterized the Negro<br />\ncommunity as a colony, might<br />\nagree that Lodge was actuallY<br />\ndealing with external affairs.<br />\nNixon and Goldwater<br />\nWhile Barry Goldwater was,<br />\nbumbling through 1964, he did<br />\nannounce that he would seep<br />\nadvice on foreign policy froni<br />\nNixon, among others. Perhaps he<br />\ndid, and perhaps, as Newsweek<br />\namong others has reported, Nixon<br />\nwas in Goldwater's mind foi<br />\nSecretary of State. But Nixon was<br />\nnot among Goldwater's intimates,<br />\nalthough he did some campaigning<br />\nfor the nominee.<br />\nOf these men, only Dulles had<br />\nexperience in foreign affairs<br />\nchronologically comparable to<br />\nBall's.

Where Cath-22 wore long<br />\nand<br />\nleisurely epics of the<br />\nri<br />\ndiculous, We Bombed in New<br />\n11\"en uses a remarkable<br />\necononr..<br />\nY<br />\nThe play is almost a<br />\ncomic review of<br />\nanti-military<br />\nblack humor. As<br />\nsuch, it suggests<br />\nthat Catch<br />\nin tended -22 itself was perhaps<br />\nit were as such an inventory-- if<br />\nnot for the ending of the<br />\n11,Pvel, an ending which brought all<br />\nLae finely woven threads together.<br /><br />\nin an almost Dickensonian orgy of<br />\nfinality.<br />\nWe Bombed in New Haven,like<br />\nCatch-22, ends on a tragic note, a<br />\nnote which is perhaps the ultimate<br />\nin updating. While the novel leaves<br />\nus with the protagonist finding his<br />\ntruth in running, the play ends<br />\nfirst with one protagonist(there is<br />\nno Yossarian superman in the<br />\nplay) yielding to man's perpetual<br />\ninstinct to go back and try to<br />\nwork things out (only to die in<br />\nthe present), while another man,<br />\nan older and more stable man, a<br />\nmore tired man, is faced with the<br />\nunavoidability of handing his onus<br />\nof logical death over to the next<br />\ngeneration (dying in the future).<br />\nIt was easy for a young man to<br />\nrun when running was the only<br />\nway to attain the heroic goal of<br />\nstaying alive. It was even easy for<br />\nthe young man to make a human<br />\nmistake and to die. But what can<br />\nthe old man do when he has no<br />\nmistakes left to make, when he<br />\nmust present his offspring with<br />\nthe same morbid inevitabilities<br />\nthat shaped his life?<br />\n\"How can I be a father,\" says<br />\nthe father, \"so soon?\"<br />\nBut \"so soon\" is upon Heller<br />\nand the thought frightens him.<br />\nPerhaps this in some part explains<br />\nthe\\ amount of attention paid to<br />\nthe actors' interaction with the<br />\naudience. For if there is any one<br />\nvalid criticism of Catch-22 it is<br />\nthat the book is far away from its<br />\naudience, too prone to being<br />\nsomeone else's funny story. In the<br />\nplay, the actors present<br />\nthemselves as actors playing parts<br />\nfor you, the audience. Heller<br />\ninstructs the actors to make<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\ncontemporary references,<br />\nwherever and whenever the play is<br />\nperformed and never to forget or<br />\nlet the audience forget that they<br />\nare on the real stage before the<br />\nreal people in the real seats. When<br />\nHenderson, the young Yossarian<br />\nimitation dies, he dies first as a<br />\ncharacter, then as the actor who<br />\npreviously presented the audience<br />\nwith his real life name. Heller does<br />\neverything short of using (in the<br />\nold Greek manner) condemned<br />\ncriminals for real slaughter on<br />\nstage in his determination to bring<br />\nthe Catch-22 down into first row<br />\ncenter.<br />\nIf we are all a part of the<br />\ncatch-22 it is because we have<br />\nnever left that safe, absurd way of<br />\nthinking symbolized by the<br />\nofficer demanding the private in<br />\nfront of his nose to formalize his<br />\nexistence with a loud \"here, sir\".<br />\nWe are all in the catch-22 not<br />\nbecause the World War II<br />\nblindness never ended, not<br />\nbecause the military has come to<br />\nus with respectable attache case,<br />\nbut because we still live in blissful<br />\ncohabitation with our acceptance<br />\nof death and the horrible logic of<br />\ndeath arranged for us by someone<br />\nelse.<br />\nThus, there is nothing new said<br />\nin We Bombed in New Haven. But<br />\nwhat has been said before is being<br />\nsaid directly to us, to us loudly<br />\nbecause we still mire ourselves in<br />\nthe inevitability of our own<br />\nslaughter. And that catch-22 has<br />\nstill to be repeated, repeated<br />\nloudly and screamed in the<br />\ndarkness, this perhaps, is the<br />\nheight of Heller's black humor.<br /><br />\nfilms, though equally as erotic as<br />\n\"Mondo Nympho\"-type films, are<br />\ngiven enough respectability by the<br />\nhigh quality of their production<br />\nto be admitted to the lofty<br />\nplateau of the Fellini-BergmanAntonioni circuit. Now, thanks to<br />\nMetzger, the intelligentisia can get<br />\nits dirt without embarrassment.<br />\nMetzger, in my mind, is the Hugh<br />\nHefner of cinema. Just as we use<br />\nPlayboy's interview with the Rev.<br />\nSloane Coffin as a rationalization<br />\nto look at the fold-out, so we use<br />\nMetzger's high quality of<br />\nproduction as a rationalization to<br />\nlook at a bunch of nude scenes.<br />\nGreat Expectations<br />\nTo say I expected a real sizzler<br />\nwould be an understatement.<br />\nMany things created the great<br />\nexpectations I had for the film,<br />\nnot the least of which were all<br />\nthose Baltimore Lesbians<br />\ncrowding in front of the theater.<br />\nDuring the first hour the eager<br />\naudience was treated to nothing<br />\nmore than an older Therese<br />\nwandering around her old school<br />\nhaving flashbacks of her life with<br />\nIsabelle. As of the first hour, there<br />\nwas no big sex scenes, unless you<br />\nconsider reading Beaudelaire to<br />\neach other and holding hands as<br />\nhot stuff. The disgruntled<br />\naudience began to get restless and<br />\ncomments like, \"I spent $2.50 to<br />\nwatch two dikes hold hands?\"<br />\nwere heard.<br />\nYet those familiar with the<br />\nways of the arty skin-flick knew<br />\nthat Metzger was leading the<br />\naudience on to some real big<br />\nscenes. Sure enough, the first sex<br />\nscene came along and the<br />\naudience leaned forward<br />\nexpectantly. This is it! Therese is<br />\nin bed. The clock reads four<br />\no'clock. She can't sleep. Slowly<br />\nshe slips her hand under her<br />\nbedsheet, and the camera follows<br />\nher hand as it glides down her<br />\nbody. The camera pans up to<br />\nTherese's face. She begins to roll<br />\nher eyes, and breathe heavily. She<br />\nis moaning, moving her sweaty<br />\nface from side to side, her mouth<br />\npalpitating. She writhes and<br />\nmoans in this manner for another<br />\nfive minutes, with the camera<br />\nnever moving from her contorted<br />\nface. This is a sex scene? Forget it.<br />\nIt is around as sexy as an<br />\nastronauts's face being contorted<br />\nby atmospheric pressure or a<br />\nperson having an epileptic fit.<br />\nWith a few angry comments<br />\nthe audience sits back, mulling<br />\nover what they missed that<br />\nevening to see some idiot girl<br />\nbreathing heavily. They murmur<br />\namong themselves waiting for Sex<br />\nScene Number Two. When Sex<br /><br />\nScene Number Two approaches,<br />\nthe audience once again leans<br />\nforward hopefully. Therese has<br />\nentered Isabelle's room and they<br />\nhave taken off their nightgowns<br />\nand we get a quick glimpse of<br />\ntheir naked bodies. Whoopeedo!<br />\nTherese lies down on the bed and<br />\n_Isabelle commences an interesting<br />\nform of dalliance. But once more<br />\nthe camera zooms in on Therese's<br />\nface and we get another closeup<br />\nof Therese's face turning from one<br />\nside to another, moaning, etc. As<br />\nif that wasn't enough, Metzger<br />\nadds insult to injury by having<br />\nViolet te Leduc's effusive and<br />\nmawkish prose voiced over<br />\nTherese's panting face. Leduc's<br />\nwriting is filled with lush, trite<br />\nmetaphors, as if a thirteen year<br />\nold school girl, fed on True Romance comic books decided to<br />\nwrite a pornographic novel. Here<br />\nis a sample of the kind of junk<br />\nLeduc writes: \"Her probing fingers<br />\ncrushed my entrails, sending<br />\nflames of ecstasy up my flesh.<br />\nYes, I was transformed by love,<br />\nmy entire being throbbing with<br />\nexcitement.\" The language, too,<br />\nquite obviously fails as<br />\npornography, or as anything else<br />\nfor that matter.<br />\nResentful, realizing that it had<br />\nbeen conned, the audience began<br />\nto laugh at the absurdness of the<br />\nfilm\u2014there was simply nothing<br />\nelse for it to do. Only the<br />\n}possibility that the movie might<br />\ncontain a good pornographic<br />\nscene kept people there until the<br />\nlast reel. But that scene never<br />\ncame\u2014only closeups of Therese or<br />\nIsabelle sweating and moaning.<br />\nThen gratefully, it was over.<br />\nMetzger, no doubt, will make a<br />\nmillion.<br />\nTHE HAPPENING<br />\nThe Student Council, in an<br />\neffort to involve all of the faculty, administration and students<br />\nin an informal non-classroom<br />\ntype of meeting, is bringing<br />\nforth a Hopkins Happening next<br />\nweek on the Soccer Field immediately following the F&amp;M<br />\nfootball game.<br />\nAll members of the faculty<br />\nreceived individual personal invitations to the affair which includes an all-you-can-eat-picnic<br />\n-style barbecue followed by a<br />\nconcert by guitarist Charlie<br />\nByrd.<br />\nPrices for both barbecue and<br />\nconcert are $2.50 single and<br />\n$4.00 couple.<br />\n* * * * * * * *<br /><br />\n* * * * *<br /><br />\nHIM Adds Ball<br />\nTo Campaign<br />\n(Continued from Page 6)<br /><br />\nBall's influence on Humphrey's<br />\nVietnam position is at this point a<br />\nmatter of conjecture.

It has been<br />\nsuggested by more than one<br />\ncolumnist that the reason for the<br />\nlow draft calls which started last<br />\nspring and which many predict<br />\nwill rise again after the elections,<br />\nis the presidential election. What<br />\nis your view?<br />\nHERSHEY- I don't know. In the<br />\nfirst place, I'm not a politician<br />\nthough I've been accused of it<br />\nonce or twice. There was that kid<br />\nwho came to my press conference<br />\nin the summertime that did that.<br />\nHe was the one that got rue mixed<br />\nup with Wallace, but I don't mind.<br />\nHe was from the University of<br />\nWyoming, and working for the<br />\nsummer, and I did try to say that<br />\nhe misinterpreted me.<br />\n_<br />\nI do think you might try to<br />\nthink of this a little bit. There's<br />\nbeen somewhere around 60,000<br />\nto 80,000 National Guard<br />\nreservists called. I think if you will<br />\nadd the last six months and set it<br />\noff against what we might have<br />\nhad, you might find that 60,000<br />\nor so is somewhere near the<br />\ndifference, (meaning that the<br />\nreservists displaced the usual<br />\namount of draftees - Ed.)<br />\nI wished I knew more about<br />\nhow we get these calls anyway.<br />\nOne of my problems has been<br />\ntrying to get them early enough.<br />\nIn the last 36 months, the calls<br />\nhave been anywhere from 15 to<br />\n45 days late. I think part of it is<br />\nthe machine world. We have to<br />\novershoot our calls all the time in<br />\norder to come up to where we're<br />\nsupposed to.<br />\nN-L- In other words, if this was a<br />\npolitical manuever, it was<br />\naccomplished by calling up the<br />\nNational Guard instead of<br />\ninducting people through the<br />\nSelective Service?<br />\nHERSHEY - Let's get straight<br />\nabout two or three things. The<br />\nCongress passes the law. The<br />\nquestion of acceptability is in the<br />\nArmed Forces, and also numbers,<br />\nwe haven't anything to do with<br />\nnumbers. The only thing we<br />\ndecide is when the individual goes.<br />\nThe liability is based on Congress<br />\nand the calls on the Armed Forces<br />\nwithin the limits that congress has<br />\ngiven them money to have people.<br />\nAnd I read time and time and<br />\ntime and time again in the press \u2014<br />\nnot the college press, I don't have<br />\na very good cutting service on that<br />\n\u2014 that the Director of Selective<br />\nService notified the local boards<br />\nthat there would be no more<br />\ndeferments for graduate students.<br />\nAnd that's true.

What about the alleged<br />\nlack of uniforni guidelines to<br />\ngovern local boards?<br />\nHERSHEY- Well, that's a good<br />\nquestion, but offhand what do<br />\nyou mean by a uniform guideline?<br />\nThere's been a lot of talk, but not<br /><br />\na lot of things said. They talk<br />\nabout guidelines, they talk about<br />\nnational pools, they talk about a<br />\nlot of things, but they don't say<br />\nanything about them because in<br />\nthe first place most of them don't<br />\nknow what they're talking about.<br />\n1 think I've been around quite<br />\nawhile.<br />\nThis morning I asked my staff,<br />\nwhat do you think a national pool<br />\nis? What's a guideline? Well, in the<br />\nfirst place, all boys are liable<br />\nbetween ages 18 and 35, is a<br />\nguideline. It's in the law.

They say<br />\nthat when a kid is twenty, he is<br />\nold enough to go on his mission.<br />\nNow a lot of people say that a<br />\ntwenty year old isn't old enough<br /><br />\nabout taking 19 year olds. What to preach. But in Utah and<br />\ndid the Congress do? Congress Eastern California they let the<br />\nsaid that if the President wanted twenty year olds do this. When I<br />\nto take 19 year olds he could do was in Georgia, I was checking up<br />\nit. He delegated that to the on this case and the Georgia board<br />\nSecretary of Defense. He's had it told me that the kid had gone to<br />\nfor over a year. Have we had any Utah where he got a mission and a<br />\ncalls for 19 year olds? We have minister's deferment.

When they<br />\ncome and sit in my office here<br />\nand not let me work for a week or<br />\ntwo, then I think they're violating<br />\nthe law and I thing they are doing<br />\nsomething which is not in the<br />\nnational interest and therefore<br />\nthey can't be deferred.

As a result, the headline<br />\nand the first few paragraphs of<br />\nyour front page story on this<br />\nsubject on September 27 give a<br />\nquite misleading impression, both<br />\nof my personal views and of<br />\nUniversity policy on this matter.<br />\nIn the first part of lhe<br />\ninterview, we reviewed together<br />\nthe content of the Higher<br />\nEducation Bill on this point. The<br />\nSenate version (the latest available<br />\nat the time of the interview)<br />\nprovided for the cutting off of<br />\nfederal financial aid to students<br />\nunder two circumstances: (a)<br />\nwhen a University finds that a<br />\nstudent has been convicted by a<br />\ncourt of certain types of stated<br />\ndisruptive activities, or(b) when a<br />\nUniversity finds that a student has<br />\n\"willfully refused to obey a lawful<br />\nregulation or order of such<br />\ninstitution and that such refusal<br />\nwas of a serious nature and<br />\ncontributed to the disruption of<br />\nthe administration of such<br />\ninstitution.\" I pointed out that<br />\nthis version was substantially<br />\nbetter than the mandatory cut off<br />\nprovisions passed last spring by<br />\nthe House of Representatives,<br />\nagainst which strong objection<br /><br />\nINC.<br /><br />\nwas made by me and many other<br />\nuniversity presidents.<br />\nMr. Hoelscher then asked<br />\nwhether the University had<br />\nestablished guidelines for defining<br />\n\"serious disruption\". I stated that<br />\nwe had not, and that the whole<br />\nquestion of procedures for<br />\nstudent conduct and discipline<br />\nwas under review and would be<br />\ndiscussed in coming months<br />\namong representative bodies of<br />\nfaculty, students, and<br />\nadministration.

This is Humphrey's<br />\nremark that a democratic South<br />\nVietnam has been in our national<br />\ninterest. This was the main contention of the opponents of the<br />\nwar from the beginning: that such<br />\nis not the case. It still isn't. For<br />\nif one admits the initial commitment as a mistake, none of the<br />\nensuing trashy policy makes sense.<br />\nWe cannot defend every country<br />\nthat is threatened by an idealogical<br />\nmovement. Humphrey admits this<br />\nin his speech, but does not see the<br />\ndifference between this overall<br />\npolicy framework and the particularity of our policy in Vietnam.<br />\nThe primary importance of this<br />\nspeech is that Humphrey has<br />\naccepted the McCarthy position<br />\nof Vietnam, and the underlying<br />\nassumption motivating it, without<br />\nthe irrationality of some of that<br />\nposition.

Turner, Jr. resides at Hopkins as director of athletics.<br />\nUsually dressed impeccably in conservative suits and always fondlingra<br />\npipe, one expects, upon entering his office, a dissertation that \"you're<br />\nin good hands with All-State.\" Although he may rarely deal with a<br />\nhealth insurance claim, his functions run from freshmen Phys Ed. excuses to the administration of a yearly $200,000 athletic budget.<br />\nMr. Turner's tenure at Hopkins extends a generation. He speaks<br />\nwith nostalgia, \"Students have changed. Today they are less willing to<br />\naccept discipline and rules and regulations for the good of the community. It's not showing individualism by breaking laws and interfering with others.\"<br />\nTurnerian Thesis<br />\nLike most educators Mr. Turner is rather concerned with student<br />\ndiscontent and violent revolt. \"The old theory was that kids are kids<br />\nand to let them let off steam. Yet of late they have pushed too far.<br />\nSchools with the least trouble were those who acted with necessary<br />\nforce in the beginning. There should be no delay to react to total<br />\ndisruption.\"<br />\nTurner pontificated in a monotone, \"It's one thing to disagree and<br />\nto protest responsibly, but the kids can't accept no for an answer.<br />\nThey're appalled if they can't get instant results so they tear everything apart.\" Mr. Turner stopped to chug some chocolate milk.\"It<br />\nseems that these demonstrations are organized nationwide and Hopkins<br />\nisn't immune to it. The danger is from extremists at all ends, and the<br />\nlarge middle group says little.\"<br />\nSports provides the great analogy. \"Through sports one can show<br />\nhis individuality instead of objecting to the general order.\" He emphasized sports' proverbial virtue that all play by the rules. \"No matter<br />\nhow much a bad cal( hurts it's still better to have a game than no game<br />\nat all. Although agaia we found that the intramural program can't be<br />\nrun without officials, because the kids can't accept no.\"<br /><br />\nIN PRO STYLE, Joe Cowan ties into a 72 yard punt against<br />\nMuhlenberg.<br /><br />\nBOOTERS DEBUT<br />\nThe Hopkins soccer squad, momentarily set back by injuries and<br />\na postponement, is moving closer to the start of its 1968 season.<br />\nSeveral players have sustained minor injuries in practice, but as<br />\nof now the squad looks to open hostilities with a full squad when they<br />\njourney to Delaware next Tuesday.<br />\nDue to the unavailability of officials, the Hopkins-Morgan State<br />\nscrimmage was postponed to October 3 at Homewood. No<br />\ninformation is available on the outcome.<br /><br />\n(Continued on Page 12)<br /><br />\nELECTION 68<br /><br />\nOunce of Prevention<br />\nAfter articulating the present situation with caution, Mr. Turner<br />\nsensed the crux of the matter with unusual enthusiasm. \"The key is<br />\nthat we must challenge the students to do something good. Educators<br />\nmust find the right kind of challenges . . . beyond the self . . . cause<br />\nkids are basically good. The rioters are just misdirected talent.\"<br />\nCandidly, Hopkins bears a great burden of the guilt. \"Hopkins is<br />\ntraditionally too academic and there is not enough attention given to<br />\nnon-academic areas. The most unfortunate aspect is that the teachers<br />\nplace too much emphasis on their own research and graduate students.<br />\nThe result is that the undergrads are left to fend for themselves.\"<br />\nParticipating in one of Snack Bar Mary's BLT's, Turner continued,<br />\n\"However, this University is not so stiff and stereotyped that the kids<br />\ncan't work out programs with the administration. Things are not black<br />\nand white and just because there is gray it doesn't mean that we have<br />\nsold out to the establishment.-<br /><br />\ntheme of orientation this year was<br />\nthe campaign to instill the freshmen with a social conscience. And<br />\ncertainly we will agree that this is<br />\na good thing.<br />\nBrains Or Brawn<br />\nBut orientation also included<br />\nan athletic assembly. There are, of<br />\ncourse, many reasons why one<br />\nshould try out for a sport ranging<br />\nfrom a convenient way to release<br />\none's aggressions to an excellent<br />\nsource of self-discipline, Yet,when<br />\nfootball players are asked what<br />\nthey most dislike about Hopkins<br />\nfootball it is that no one watches<br />\nthem - or, perhaps more honestly,<br />\nthat no one watches them because<br />\nevery one has better things to do<br />\nand besides, the team is just a lot<br />\nof dumb football players.<br />\nTo be sure, any one who writes<br />\noff the team as a group of individually worthless people is himself guilty of a very serious bias.<br />\nThere are people like Phil Shrodel<br />\nand Willie Scroggs who went out<br />\nin their Junior year not to have<br />\nfun, but because they felt that<br />\nthey owed it to the school not to<br />\ndesert a loser. Any one who has<br />\never met Dan Rosenfeld, Ken<br />\nBrown,or Gus Slotman can attend<br />\nto their ability to function in<br />\nsocial situations other than beer<br />\nparties. These football players<br />\ndon't play only for themselves they play for Johns Hopkins for us.<br />\nBut is that enough to justify<br />\ngiving up one's time to watch a<br />\nfootball team? Perhaps not, but<br />\nthere are other reasons.
