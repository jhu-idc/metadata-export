He was<br />\nextremely popular, always ready with a smile, fond of folk<br />\ndancing and pralines, and last semester his Chi Psi brothers<br />\nunanimously elected him treasurer of the fraternity. This proved<br />\nan error. Gaugin, alas, promptly absconded with the money<br />\nand went to Tahiti to paint.

Now<br />\nSashweight, before he became a disreputable vendor, had<br />\ntaken numerous prized as a cross-country runner,and he thought<br />\nhe would soon outdistance young Sigafoos. But he reckoned<br />\nWithout Sigafoos's stick-to-itiveness. At last report the two<br />\nof them had passed Cleveland.

She was merely going<br />\nhonie for Christmas on the Natchez, Mobile, and Boise Railroad, and during the night, alas, her upper berth slammed shut<br />\n91i her.
