Assistant Attorney General Stanford Hess, who wrote the<br />\nopinion for Mr. Burch, calls the<br />\nlaw \"fairly narrow\" and points out<br />\nthat the \"Maryland statutes do not<br />\npick up where NLRB (National<br />\nLabor Relations Board) regulations<br />\nleave off.\"<br />\nWhether or not universities,<br />\nas non-profit-making institutions,<br />\nare subject to the NLRB Act is an<br />\nopen question.

Archibald is the President of the Student Association and one<br />\nof the movement's proponents.<br />\nThe plan was formulated following the<br />\nestablishment of the Johns Hopkins Urban<br />\nAffairs Center \"in recognition of the<br />\nUniversity's responsibility to the needs<br />\nof the Baltimore Community.\" The<br />\nadministration simultaneously implemented an Urban Affairs course of study<br />\nin the Social and Behaviorial Sciences,<br />\nsupplemented by related courses in<br />\nSocial Relations, Geography, Environmental Engineering, Economics,History<br />\nand Education.<br />\n<br />\nBlueprint for Change<br />\nHowever, as a result of inefficient<br />\nplanning and the desire on the part of<br />\na group of students led by Archibald,<br />\nSam Katz, Ron Remick, Paul Allen and<br />\nHarry Singleton to \"keep pace with new<br />\ndevelopments in the area,\" a new blueprint for an Urban Affairs Concentrate<br />\nwas drafted. The students then met with<br />\nprominent people from the Social Relations Department and the Center to discuss the recommendations. Both Archibald and Dean Swanson, who sat in on the<br />\nmeeting, described the discussion as<br />\nfruitful.<br />\nThe proposals incorporate three basic<br />\nrecommendations: seminars dealingwith<br />\npoverty, health problems, physical planning, crime, and delinquency will be<br />\noffered. It is hoped they will supplement<br />\n<br />\nJim Archibald, President of the Student Association, is a leader in the call<br />\nfor an Urban Affairs curriculum.<br />\nconsideration of the theory of the problems with \"a heavy emphasis\" on practical planning and problem solving.<br />\nThe plan also included an Urban Affairs Symposium. It was believed guest<br />\nlesturers from the academic and local<br />\ncommunities could be obtained, at a low<br />\ncost. However, Archibald now feels the<br />\nsymposium to be \"improbable\" because<br />\nof a lack of funds.<br />\nThe third proposal, a work/study internship,will be included in order to provide a student with the opportunity to<br />\nlearn about the political aspects of urban<br />\naffairs while he receives academic credit<br />\nor a salary.<br />\n<br />\nDean Carl P. Swanson, who sat in on a meeting with the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment and the Urban Affairs Center, called the session \"fruitful\".<br />\n<br />\nThis proposal was made last year by<br />\nD'Alesandro in a<br />\nThomas<br />\nMayor<br />\nNews-Letter interview. D'Alesandro<br />\nstated that \"The fact' that we hold public<br />\noffice doesn't give us any cornerstone<br />\non knowledge. We are the center of some<br />\nfine educational institutions, like Hopkins<br />\nand the rest, and I would like to see them<br />\nallocate to me, as Mayor, some of their<br />\nbest brainpower--not only faculty but<br />\nstudents as well, on the order of the White<br />\nHouse Fellowships.\"<br />\nThe faculty, at the time, expressed<br />\nagreement with the general principles<br />\nof the proposal but noted several difficulties. Many stated, however, that the pro-<br />\n<br />\nblems were primarily administrative and<br />\ncould be resolved \"if there is the will to<br />\ndo so.\"<br />\n<br />\nHope for the Future<br />\nAccording to Archibald, next semester<br />\nwill see improved scheduling.. He also<br />\nhopes the curriculum will be expanded<br />\nbeyond the introductory level.<br />\nArchibald expects students who participate \"will increase their awareness of<br />\ncommunity problems, and attempt to<br />\nhelp solve them.\" He believes increased<br />\nblack admissions to the University to be<br />\n\"a desireable possible outgrowth\" of<br />\nthe program.<br />\n<br />\nCAMPUS NOTES\\/ !Vial;4ilappettiAl<br />\nHOW THE TIME FLIES<br />\nAdvising in preparation for the<br />\nsecond term will be held on December<br />\n1, 2, and 3.

DiFebo and Claxton point out that<br />\n1231 has been organizing at Hopkins<br />\nsince March, whereas 1199 has only<br />\nshown interest since the signing of the<br />\nConsent Election Agreement.<br />\nPunch criticizes 1231's arguments<br />\non the grounds that 1199, although new<br />\nto the Baltimore area, has been<br />\nbusy<br />\nsuccessfully organizing previously \"untouchable\" non-professional workers at<br />\nnumerous local hospitals and nursing<br />\nhomes, including Hopkins, Sinai, Franklin Square, Maryland General, Levindale, and the Jewish Convalescent Home.<br />\nWith more than 5,000 members, all organized within the year, Punch questions<br />\nthe accusation that his union would<br />\nwant<br />\nto raid for the sake of raiding.<br />\n\"The only thing that a union organizer<br />\nshould organize for is that he wants<br />\nto<br />\nchange the working conditions of workers,\" Punch states. \"No other reason<br />\nis valid in my book.\"<br />\n<br />\nexcept something that's trying to get on<br />\nthe books as a union.\"<br />\nLocal 1199 has already won an election at Hopkins Hospital and is now in<br />\nthe process of negotiating a contract<br />\nthere. \"The University and the Hospital are closely alligned, \"Punch states.<br />\n\"It would be detrimental to the workers<br />\nat the Hospital for someone to come<br />\nin and organize the University employees<br />\nand settle for a contract below our standards.\"<br />\nLocal 1199's standard economic demands center on a minimum salary rate<br />\nof $100 per week for the lowest category of employees, pension and welfare<br />\nprograms with co-ntributions from the<br />\nemployer and a minimum of twelve days<br />\nannual sick leave in ad lition to paid vacations.<br />\nPunch regards Local 1231's organizing campaign as \"suspicious\" because<br />\nthe University has not put up a fight.<br />\n\"If Jim Claxton had not gotten a consent election so quietly and easily,\" he<br />\nstates, \"we would not be petitioning for<br />\nan election at Hopkins. We don't organize that way. We only organize when<br />\nworkers are willing and ready to move....<br />\nWe don't contact the administration, until we contact the workers first.\"<br />\n<br />\nMembers Complained<br />\nLocal 1199 did not begin waging concerted organizing campaign at Hopkins<br />\nuntil its members complained that they<br />\nwould be forced to choose between 1231<br />\nand no union at all, under the current<br />\nconsent election accord. In the past,<br />\nPunch has viewed Hopkins employees as<br />\n\"terribly intimidated\"--too intimidated<br />\nto act, and too intimidated to be organized. He points to the ill-fated Homewood<br />\nGrievance Committee, \"which<br />\ncould have been a good thing,if the workers had made it a good thing.\"<br />\nPunch takes the position that \"no boss<br />\nmeans a worker a damn bit of good....<br />\n<br />\nLife and Death<br />\nHe maintains that \"1231 is in trouble<br />\nbecause they haven't organized anyone<br />\nelse around here.

If this committee is formed, it,<br />\nin turn, will consider whether a second<br />\ncommittee will be appointed, the latter<br />\nto deal with the actual question of governance at Hopkins. 2) that Beer appoint<br />\nthe first committee without calling a<br />\nspecial meeting of the Assembly.<br />\nA message from the Student Council<br />\nto the faculty will be distribu<br />\nted with<br />\nBeer's letter. The message will stress<br />\nthe urgency of the problem of student<br />\nParticipation<br />\nin university decisionmaking.<br />\nThe Student Council's letter is taken<br />\nalmost word for word from an address<br />\nPrepared by Lauren Walters, Secretary,<br />\nfor delivery before the November 7 meeting of the Assembly.On that day, Walters<br />\nwas unable to deliver his address, for<br />\ndiscussion of University governance was<br />\nPostponed due to a lack of time.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Step Process<br />\nThe question of governance was introduced most recently by the Academic<br />\nCouncil. In its October 15 meeting, the<br />\nCouncil urged the General Assembly to<br />\ndeal with governance in a two step prdeal with governance in a two step process. First, it was recommended that the<br />\nAssembly form a committee to survey<br />\n<br />\nHopkins employees workinglate hours in the library. The workers will vote on December 5 on the<br />\nquestion of unionization.<br />\nphoto by hoffinann<br />\neven in the case of the so-called nonprofit-making institutions. They're out<br />\nto keep costs down at the expense of<br />\nworkers. And I always look with a<br />\nsquinched eye at any situation where<br />\nall of a sudden the labor organization<br />\nwalks in--and no problem.\"<br />\n\"We don't go into the boss's office<br />\nand say 'Look. Don't worry. Sign an<br />\nagreement. No problems....' We take<br />\nthe workers. We march into the office,<br />\nand say, 'Give us an election. No deals.<br />\nNo compromises.\"<br />\n\"It seems that for some reason or<br />\nanother,\" Punch observes, \"the University has decided that it's not going<br />\nto be so bad living with 1231. If its<br />\nnot too bad living with 1231, then I don't<br />\nsee that the workers are going to be<br />\ndoing too cool.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins administration has adopted an official public posture of neutra-<br />\n<br />\nlity towards 1231, in accordance with<br />\nits new labor relations policy. The policy which sets forth the aim of the<br />\nUniversity \"to be a good employer,\"<br />\nevolved during the early stages of 1231's<br />\norganizing campaign, and was approved<br />\nby University President Lincoln Gordon<br />\nand the Board of Trustees.<br />\nThe policy statement, which was made<br />\npublic along with the Consent Election<br />\nAgreement on October 29 states that<br />\n\"the university recognizes the right of<br />\nits employees to organize in appropriate<br />\ngroups for the purpose of collective<br />\nbargaining....<br />\n\"In. the event that a duly constituted<br />\ngroup of employees should be formed as<br />\na result of a secret ballot election conducted under impartial supervision, the<br />\nuniversity will recognize such a group<br />\nand negotiate with it in good faith.\"<br />\n<br />\nBookstore Changes Ways;<br />\nSecurity Guards Might Go<br />\nStudents in search of books for second<br />\nsemester courses may have an easier<br />\ntime of it as compared with the frustrations of last semester, accordingto Dean<br />\nRobert Strider, Chairman of the Bookstore Committee.<br />\nStrider declared this week that his<br />\ncommittee will be meeting weekly in the<br />\ncoming months to implement proposals<br />\nfor improving the book center. Their<br />\nactions will be based on a report concerning bookstore operations prepared<br />\nrecently by efficiency experts from Peat,<br />\nMarwick, Mitchell and Co.The efficiency<br />\nstudy cost the University approximately<br />\n$4500, according to Strider.<br />\nThe report divided its recommendations into six general areas: organization, personnel, physical outlay, accounting procedures and inventory handling.<br />\nMajor recommendations included a reevaluation of the Book Center's position<br />\nwithin the University and a streamlining<br />\nof its inventory procedures.<br />\nLauren Walters, Secretary of the S.C., criticized the cumbersome way in which the Faculty Assembly is handling the question of university governance.<br />\n<br />\nthe campus; to see if governance reform<br />\nwas widely supported. If the need for reform were demonstrated, the committee<br />\nwould recommend to the Council \"the<br />\ncomposition of and charge to a body to<br />\npropose appropriate revisisions in the<br />\nmechanisms for policy formulations.\"<br />\nTo<br />\nWalters, the two step process<br />\nseems an unnecessary delay.

He stated that in the<br />\nimmediate future his committee would<br />\ngive highest priority \"to making current<br />\noperations as efficient as possible.\" In<br />\nline with this immediate priority, Strider said that the Committee would devote itself in the next few weeks to ensuring that students receive required<br />\ntexts at the beginning of second semester.<br />\nThe report suggested that supervisory<br />\nauthority over the Book Center be transfered from the Office of the Dean of the<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences to the Vice<br />\nPresident for Administration.In explain.,<br />\n<br />\ning the suggested relocation, the study<br />\nemphasized<br />\nthe<br />\nneed for greater<br />\n'business direction.'<br />\nCiting the low turnover rate in inventory as a major cause of inefficiency,<br />\nthe report also recommended that the<br />\nimmediate reduction of inventory levels.<br />\nThe study found as a particular problem<br />\nthe overstocking of books not required<br />\nin academic courses but of interest only<br />\nto certain professors and students.

He was reluctant to<br />\neliminate the security guard, he said,<br />\nbecause he thought the present security<br />\narrangements acted as a deterred to<br />\ntheft.<br />\nAs to the other recommendations,however, Vane conceded that the report was<br />\nof considerable value in efforts to improve the operation of the Book Center.<br />\nIn a final area, that of physical outlay,<br />\nthe report suggested the extension of the<br />\ncounter space in order to increase clerk<br />\nsales as opposed to self service purchases.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 4<br />\n<br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, Nov.<br />\n<br />\n, 1969<br />\n<br />\nSA Draft Counselling Offers Viable Alternatives<br />\nThe free draft counselling service of<br />\nLevering Hall is designed to make people<br />\naware of the alternatives open to them<br />\nunder the Selective Service Act.<br />\n\"We try to help individual young men<br />\nto make responsible decisions about their<br />\nfuture,\" said Leonard Turk a graduate<br />\nstudent and draft counsellor. He noted<br />\nthat a lot of people \"refuse to deal with<br />\ntheir own futures.\" This has become apparent in the poor attendance which is<br />\ngenerally from the 18 to 19 year age<br />\nbracket with few graduate students taking advantage of the service.<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, chaplain of the<br />\nUniversity, was instrumental in developing the draft counseling program. For<br />\nthe last two years this service has<br />\noperated out of Levering Hall, although<br />\nit receives only nominal funding from<br />\nthe University.<br />\npeople,\" Turk continued,<br />\n\"Most<br />\n\"come to the sessions with specific problems relating to medical deferrments<br />\nand how to get classifications.\" These<br />\ntype of questions are easily cleared up<br />\nwith short answers and consequently the<br />\ncounsellors \"do not have the opportunity<br />\nto get to know that much about the ad-<br />\n<br />\nvisees. The counsellors, who are available for consultation from 2 p.m. to 4<br />\np.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays,would<br />\nideally like to build up files on the students \"at least as extensive as that of the<br />\nlocal draft boards.\"<br />\n<br />\nIrrevocable Decisions<br />\nMr. Turk noted that \"Canada is not an<br />\neasy way out and it may involve a series<br />\nof irrevocable decisions.\" The counselling offered is ostensibly \"a way to work<br />\nwithin the system. There are ways to<br />\neal with the .system short of running<br />\naway.\"<br />\nOne such alternative is the attainment<br />\nof a conscientious objector or CO classification.There are two CO classifications<br />\navailable. They are 1-0 which defers the<br />\nperson from all military service and<br />\n1-A-0 which puts the person in a military job that is noncombat and usually<br />\nin the medical corps. Because the holder<br />\nof a 1-A-0 classification goes into the<br />\narmed forces it helps to fill the quota<br />\nof the local board. This makes this<br />\nclassification easier to obtain. Turk<br />\nnoted that \"you have to start thinking<br />\nabout what they'd normally consider poli-<br />\n<br />\ntical or philosophical grounds in terms<br />\nof religious experience if you want to<br />\nbe protected by the law.\" Highly political<br />\nclaims for getting a CO were termed<br />\n\"arguable but not likely.\" This is because the law \"excludes political, philosophical, and moral grounds\" for a<br />\nCO. Turk said that \"if they're gonna put<br />\nyou in jail anyway you might as well<br />\napply for a CO and try to stay out.\"<br />\nThere was an attempt to involve the<br />\nblack community of Baltimore in the<br />\nprogram at a meeting between Dr.Wickwire and various leaders from the community. In attendance were the Rev.<br />\nVernon Dobson, Walter Carter, and Ted<br />\nRobinson. Dr. Wickwire was discouraged<br />\nby the meeting because it was shown that<br />\nthe black community would not be receptive to the idea. Rev. Dobson said that<br />\nmany inner-city residents still look toward the armed forces as a means of<br />\nesacpirrg the horrors of the ghetto. These<br />\nservices, while available to the ghetto<br />\ndweller, \"don't fulfill a useful purpose<br />\nto the black people.\" Another large problem that has to be hurdled is that of<br />\nwhite, middle class, university students<br />\ntrying to relate to inner-city residents.<br />\n<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, University Chaplain, was<br />\ninstrumental in creating the Levering Hall Draft<br />\nCounselling Service,<br />\nphoto by lernm<br />\n<br />\n\u2018<br />\nCLASSIFIED<br />\nTRAVEL<br />\nNEW YORK TO LONDON.<br />\nSummer vacation trips - round<br />\ntrip $169.

The fact that estimates<br />\nhave ranged from 170,000 to two million<br />\ndoes not necessary reflect a lack of sophisticated means for counting crowds as<br />\nmuch as it could reflect a conspiracy to<br />\nplay down the number of people who came<br />\nout to protest Nixon's War in Washington.<br />\nThe events of the last two months seem<br />\nto indicate that such a conspiracy could<br />\neasily be the product of a political force<br />\naimed at toning down the importance of<br />\nthe peace movement and creating afeeling of uncertainty about just how widespread it actually is. Since late September, Vice President Agnew has wasted few words explaining the insignificance of the movement. Labeling the<br />\nmarchers \"snobs\" and \"intellectuals\"<br />\nand constantly refering to the general<br />\nyouthfulness of the group, Agnew finally<br />\nentered the numbers game shortly before November's peace activities.<br />\nHis first move came during a speech<br />\nin which he refe red to the couple of hundred thousand of people who might show<br />\nUP in Washington to make law in the<br />\nstreets. Next, Agnew took on the tele-<br />\n<br />\nStudents Anxious<br />\nTo Move Quickly<br />\nOn Governance<br />\n<br />\nvision networks in an attempt to cast<br />\nsome doubt on their overall credibility<br />\njust days before the Mobilization began<br />\nIn his speech November 3, President<br />\nNixon spoke specifically to the \"young\"<br />\nabout their peace activities, excluding<br />\nthe many thousands of \"not so young\"<br />\nwho were seen in October demonstrating during the Moratorium. His development of the \"silent majority\" image<br />\nduring the speech was an attempt to<br />\ncreate a positive backing for his peace<br />\npolicy in terms of numbers without really<br />\ngoing into specifics.<br />\nThe media have managed to muddle<br />\nthe reader's and the viewer's mind by<br />\nconstantly changing estimates and using<br />\nthe ever present cop-out\"more than---\"<br />\ndropping in a minimal figure and leavint the rest to imagination. Washington's<br />\nChief of Police admitted that after a<br />\ncrowd passed 250,000 he was unable to<br />\nmake an accurate guess. It is now fact<br />\nthat this was the largest demonstration<br />\never, and hence there could be no one<br />\nwith previous experience to make an<br />\naccurate comparison.<br />\nSo why say anything at all? Numbers<br />\nhave always been important in politics.<br />\nAnd like it or not, the whole peace movement thing is the very essence of what is<br />\n<br />\nhappening, politically, in America today.<br />\nActive dissent is something that American politicans are not used to. Politicians, in modern times, have been able<br />\nto operate effectively because the populace was rather quiet and distant from<br />\nwhat was really going on. The sudden<br />\nmovement, initiated largely by the<br />\nyoung, toward a politics of involvement<br />\nhas caught many old style politicoes<br />\nwith their tactical pants down.<br />\nIn the case of the Nixon Administration, it would be very difficult to admit<br />\nthat any large segment of the nation was<br />\nactively opposed to the President's War<br />\nPolicy. Admitting that even a million<br />\npeople were motivated to the point of<br />\nmarching against their President could<br />\ninflict a serious wound to the President's<br />\nimage and greatly impare his ability to<br />\ncarry out his duties under the pretense<br />\nof having the nation solidly behind him.<br />\nClearly, within the historical context at<br />\nleast, it has been the active and vocal<br />\nminority which has most radically been<br />\nable to affect change in the political<br />\nstructure of this nation. However, at this<br />\npoint in history, that change seems contrary to what would be the best interests<br />\nof the President; and many have indicated<br />\n<br />\nthat his best interests are not necessarily<br />\nthe best interests of the people. This does<br />\nnot indicate malicious intent, rather political motivation.<br />\n<br />\nWith the precedent set by the previous<br />\nMoratorium, there was no reason to expect the November activities to be more<br />\naccurately estimated. But in November<br />\nthefocus of the demonstration was changed from education to numbers. The leaders of the movement were calling the<br />\n\"masters\" at their own game.What would<br />\nthey do with a crowd that people could see<br />\nwas large and concentrated in one area?<br />\nThe truth is that no one knows for sure.<br />\nIt was the largest demonstration ever in<br />\nhistory. It dramatically surpassed the<br />\nl0,00 people who gathered earlier in the<br />\nweek at the Washington Monument and<br />\nwere immediately proclaimed the voice<br />\nof the \"silent majority.\" How 10,000<br />\npeople in Tuesday has any more right to<br />\nlay claim to 200 million than 1,5 million<br />\npeople on Saturday is a question no one<br />\nwants to answer. Likewise, no one wants<br />\nto talk about the reported thousands who<br />\ncould not come to Washington because<br />\nof sudden and mysterious bus cancellations and various weather hazards.<br />\n<br />\nTHERE ARE ALL KINDS OF BREAD<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page 3)<br />\nIn a telephone interview earlier this<br />\nweek, Beer said that \"the Academic<br />\nCouncil asked for this particular procedure.\" He implied that he was in no<br />\nPosition to change the process although<br />\nhe was aware that \"students wanted<br />\nthings to move as quickly as possible.\"<br />\nHe also stated that he had no idea which of<br />\nthe two alternatives the faculty would<br />\nChoose in response to his letter.<br />\nAgitation for student representation on<br />\ndecision-making bodies has a long history<br />\nat Hopkins.

The stateinent outlined in broad terms a philosophy<br />\nfor future action based on persuading the<br />\nadministration to \"better the quality of<br />\nthe undergraduate's environment<br />\nand<br />\nacademic opportunities\" and to enact<br />\n\"structural changes...in the University's<br />\ndecision-making processes to insure the<br />\nundergraduate a more effective voice in<br />\nUniversity policy.\"<br />\nThe announcement was followed during<br />\nthe summer by communicationbetwe<br />\nen<br />\nDr. Gordon and Secretary Walters in<br />\nWhich Walters reaffirmed the Council's<br />\nconviction that a change in administrative structure was urgent.

Kleindienst.<br />\nAlthough Kleindienst refused to name<br />\nthose who were under investigation, he<br />\ndid state that the list included members<br />\nof the steering committee of the New<br />\nMobilization Committee To End the War<br />\nin Viet Nam. The leaders of the \"New<br />\nMobe\" may be subject to prosecution<br />\nunder the provisions of the Federal Antiriot Act of 1968.,<br />\nThe only name which Kleindienst mentioned was that of David Dellinger, prominent speaker and agitator for the new<br />\nleft.

It was on this basis, Department officials contend, that agreements<br />\nbetween the government and the demonstrators were reached.<br />\nKleindienst stated that \"New Mobe\"<br />\nleaders went back on their agreement<br />\nwhen they allowed Dellinger to speak<br />\nat the rally. He cited the fact that the<br />\norganizers of the Saturday rally did<br />\nnot disavow the Justice Department demonstration as \"a breach of faith with<br />\ntheir public posture that all they were<br />\ninterested in was a peaceful demonstration.\"<br />\n<br />\nbute a pamphlet containing personal accounts of the Washington demonstrations.<br />\nHe says that he hopes that the accounts<br />\nof last Saturday's events will counteract<br />\nthe impression of violence and disunity<br />\nthe Nixon administration is<br />\nwhich<br />\nspreading.<br />\nKoutouzos will solicit personal recollections from people at Hopkins and<br />\nthroughout Baltimore.

In this<br />\ncase, however, the procedural meanderings from commit<br />\ntee to committee<br />\nshould not cloud the importance of the issue.<br />\nWhat is being considered is the creation of a committee<br />\nto determine<br />\nwhether a change in governance is needed. The<br />\nresponse to Dr. Beer's<br />\nletter to the faculty will decide on the manner in which<br />\nthis committee is<br />\nformed.

The second commit<br />\ntee<br />\nwill look into the question of what changes should be made.

Witness the recent statement of Herbert G. Klein, Nixon's<br />\ndirector of communications: \"Had it not been for the highly effective work<br />\nof<br />\nthe Washington police, of the National Guard . . . for the reserve forces<br />\nof<br />\nthe Defense Department and the complete cooperation of all elements of<br />\nthe government . . . and the work of the Justice Depart<br />\nment . . .<br />\ndamage to Washington (last weekend) would have been far greater the<br />\nthan<br />\n. . . the riots after the death of Martin Luther King.\"<br />\nAnyone who was in Washington last weekend (including the press)<br />\nwill testify to the prevailing atmosphere of unity, harmony and peacefu<br />\nlness which prevailed. The statement above and others which emanated<br />\nfrom government offices are obviously misleading.<br />\nThe primary reason for trying to convey a distorted picture of the<br />\ndemonstration activities is that Nixon knows his silent majority<br />\nis not<br />\nsolid. By making demonstrations seem smaller and more violent,<br />\nhe<br />\naccomplishes two aims. First, he conveys to his silent majority the impression that the dissenters are only a small minority. Nixon knows<br />\nthat<br />\nthose who support him need to feel they are in the mainstream\u2014that they<br />\nare on the bandwagon.<br />\nSecond and more important. Nixon wants to keep the nation scared.<br />\nThe more violent he can make a demonstration appear, the more the<br />\nideas<br />\nexpressed by the demonstrators are rejected out of simple fear.<br />\nAnd at<br />\nthis point, the President knows that fear is his most powerful<br />\nally.<br />\nThe culmination of the Nixon \"scare\u2014 campaign can be seen in<br />\nthe<br />\nJustice Department's pla n ned investiga tion of elements of the Morato<br />\nrium<br />\nand Mobilization committee to determine whether there was conspi<br />\na<br />\nracy<br />\n\"to commit violence.\"<br />\nThe larger issue, which overshadows specific Nixon pronouncemen<br />\nts<br />\non the moratorium, is the question of repression.

Word filters down that the \"Mothers of Invention\" have now broken up. But in their departure from the<br />\npop scene, they have left a hope in the form of Hot Rats.<br />\nTo say that Hot Rats sounds like the Mothers is a truth,<br />\nbut to say that it's by the Mothers is a falsehood. The only<br />\n\"Mothers\" on the record are Frank Zappa and Ian Underwood, the straight member of the group. The rest are either<br />\nstudio musicians from Straight and Bizzare Records or are<br />\njust friends of Zappa. This record just proves what the<br />\ndevout fans always knew: Zappa was the Mothers.His personality dominates Hot Rats as much as it did the Mothers.<br />\nExamples of this domination are plentiful throughout<br />\nthe album. Saxophone solos by Underwood and violin solos<br />\nby Sugar Cane Harris sound as if Zappa had played them<br />\nhimself. All harmonies are those typical of Zappa. All<br />\nguitar, including some very well done solos, is played by<br />\nZappa. To like this album is to like Frank Zappa.<br />\n<br />\nDouble Saxed<br />\nThere are high points to this album other than Zappa.<br />\nBeing the only saxophone player, Underwood has, and uses,<br />\nample opportunity to show that he is a very good doubletrack artist. He's always in time with himself and the harmonies could not have been more in tune if he had four other<br />\npeople playiiig along with him. His solos are far better than<br />\nthe ones in Uncle Meat (Bizzare 2024). Ian's piano, organ,<br />\netc. show that he is a well rounded musician.<br />\nThe addition of violinists Harris and Jean Luc Ponty is a<br />\ngreat innovation. They are each good on the instrument and<br />\nfit well into the Zappa scheme of music. Also drummers<br />\nJohn Guerin, Ron Selico and Paul Humphery do their bit to<br />\nmake the album great.<br />\n\"Peaches En Regalia\" is possibly the finest and tightest<br />\nsong on the record. This song shows Zappa's talents as<br />\nwriter and producer. A nice melody played by Underwood's<br />\nsaxes, this is where Ian shows his stuff on double -tracking.<br />\n<br />\nSexual Prevert<br />\n\"Willie the Pimp\" has the only vocal on the album. The<br />\nvocalist is Captain Beefheart, an unknown quantity from<br />\nStraight Records. I leave it to the listener to decide about<br />\n<br />\nhis vocal since it is one of the most unusual voices ever recorded. The best part of this cut is Zappa's six minute guitar<br />\nsolo which is intense, never relaxing and, most of all, never<br />\nboring.<br />\n\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\" is an instrumental version<br />\nof Uncle Meats' \"Mr. Green Genes.\" Again there is good<br />\norgan and sax work by Underwood and an excellent guitar<br />\ninterpretation of the melody by Zappa.<br />\n\"Little Umbrellas\" is a jazz-like piece with good drumming by Guerin and fine bass by Max Bennett. Underwood<br />\nspreads himself over saxes, piano, organ and flute and does<br />\nwell on all of them. This is just a nice, short, easy-tolisten-song.<br />\n\"The Gumbo Variations\" has the finest moments of Underwood and Harris. Zappa starts with a definitive melody<br />\non the guitar and Underwood then puts it through all of his<br />\nramifications. About half-way through, and almost imperceptibly, Harris takes over with his violin and explains it<br />\nall his way. humphery and Bennett combine to give an incedibly clean drum and bass back-up. This is an excellent<br />\ncut and does not get boring even though it lasts almost thirteen minutes.<br />\n\"It Must Be a Camel\" is a slow piece emphasizing the<br />\ndrums of Guerin and the bass of Bennett. Underwood again<br />\ndoes well on saxophones and piano while Zappa plays accompanying guitar to round out the sound. This is, indeed, a<br />\nnice piece with which to end the record.<br />\nOne final note: the cover was designed by Zappa and,<br />\nalmost necessarily, leaves the cover fetishist with this<br />\nfinal message: \"Shame on you. You didn't trust Mothers.\"<br />\n<br />\nciples), Mayall has picked up guitar(electric, but plugged into his P.A. system. Marshalls are out.) He still plays harmonica and sings, also does tambourine and \"mouth percussion\". He picked up acoustic guitar player John Mark from<br />\nMarianne Faithfull and kept Steve Thompson, his old bassist.<br />\nJohnny Almond rounds it out with tenor, alto, and various<br />\nflutes.<br />\n<br />\nSubtlety and Finesse<br />\nSo what Mayall has done is to trade volume and beat for<br />\nsubtlety and .finesse. The singing is neither here nor there it's just Mayall's increasingly individualistic style. Thompson has gotten a bit more imaginative, but his bass remains<br />\nbasically unchanged--he supplies pulse where it is required,<br />\nand otherwise keeps a low, if thoroughly competent, profile.<br />\nAnd that is where mere competence ends.The rest of it is<br />\nnothing short of brilliant, not to say innovative.If you think<br />\nMayall can play piano and organ, you should hear him on<br />\nguitar. The same goes double for Jon Mark. But, to my mind,<br />\nthe best of all is Almond's sax and flute playing. He has the<br />\nrange and sophistication of many \"name\" jazz people, but<br />\nhe has chosen not to abandon a recognizable framework.<br />\nTwice, he elicits spontaneous applause.(The album is live<br />\nat the Fillmore East)<br />\n<br />\nJazz Orientation<br />\n<br />\nThe music is, as usual, mostly written by Mayall.(Thompson collaborated on two of the seven cuts) in \"The Laws<br />\nMust Change,\" he makes \"a few personal observations of<br />\npolice vs. youth and the drug situation\". When he invokes the<br />\nLenny Bruce, the audience applauds. Groovy<br />\nGeorge Barneston memory of<br />\naudience.

Parker continued his self-imposed hibernation until the last week of<br />\nthe 1904 campaign. By then desperate<br />\nmeasures were clearly called for.<br />\nOf course there were wildly optimistic<br />\npress releases from various Democratic<br />\ncommittees, but to objective observers<br />\nIt was clear that the Parker campaign<br />\nwas moribund. Decisive areas were<br />\nfalling to President Roosevelt. New<br />\nYork, the decisive state in all three<br />\nCleveland campaigns, was always considered essential to Parker's hopes. At<br />\nthe start of the campign New _York was<br />\nconsidered a doubtful state. President<br />\nRoosevelt, a political perfectionist who<br />\nwas far more apprehensive than he had<br />\nto be about this campaign, had tried to<br />\nbolster the Republican cause in the state<br />\nby drafting Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler<br />\nto run for Governor. Unfortunately there<br />\nwere New York Democrats who desired<br />\nto see their candidate, and Parker's lack<br />\nof vigor in the campaign counted against<br />\nhim. At the<br />\nclose of<br />\ncamthe<br />\npaign, publications<br />\nwere generally<br />\nassigning New York to Roosevelt.<br />\nThis information virtually doomed the<br />\nParker campaign and there was nothing<br />\nto compensate for it. William J. Bryan's lukewarm support was clearly not<br />\nenough to influence the Western states<br />\nfor Parker. In the Midwest, the candidate was virtually unknown. Parker's<br />\nrunning mate was from the small state<br />\nof West Virginia. He could do no more<br />\nthan carry his home state, and conceivably he would not do that much.<br />\nBy the waning days, it was clear that<br />\nParker's policy of near-total silence had<br />\nbeen found wanting and he might find it<br />\nexpedient to issue a charge concerning<br />\nPresident Roosevelt. He had a vast area<br />\nof discretion concerning what sort of<br />\ncharge to issue. If one allows that Parker<br />\nwas the candidate of the conservative<br />\nDemocrats, charged with representing<br />\nhimself as \"safe and sane\" in contrast<br />\nto President Roosevelt, one might expect<br />\na press release to the effect that Roosevelt was a dangerous radical bent on<br />\nundermining the most venerable American institutions. The fact that Parker<br />\nmoved in the opposite direction, implicity<br />\ndescribing the President as a lackey of<br />\nWall Street, is rich in revelation concerning the initial hopelessness of the<br />\nParker campaign. The tenor of Parker's<br />\nstatement indicates a decision made by<br />\nhis headquarters to the effect that Parker<br />\nshould suddenly sound the toscin of Bryan and LaFollette against the evils of the<br />\ntrusts. It is quite conceivable that this<br />\nwas a more popular position than the<br />\nstrange call for safety and sanity, but in<br />\nParker the call for reform was out of<br />\ncharacter. Parker's gold standard telegram was a master stroke, not only because it showed the candidate in a position of command, but because it placed<br />\nhim in a conservative position entirely<br />\nin accordance with his image. Parker<br />\ncould only seem silly and inconsistent<br />\nas suddenly, in the last week of an uphill campaign, he professed to awake to<br />\nthe dangers of the trusts and their alleged collusion with President Roosevelt.<br />\nThis much said, the facts of Parker's<br />\nlast desperate stroke are relatively<br />\ndreary. The Justice elaborated on a<br />\nsuspicion which had covertly permeated<br />\ncertain Democratic journals,concerning<br />\nthe effect that the Republican National<br />\nChairman, George Cortelyou, had formerly been Secretary of Commerce and<br />\nLabor. Parker considered it unethical<br />\nthat the man formerly charged with overseeing trusts was now using his knowledge of business in the attempt to raise<br />\nmoney. He did not cite any specific<br />\ncases in which Cortelyou had exacted<br />\ntribute in return for a promise not to<br />\n<br />\nprosecute any particular trust. He was<br />\nconcerned that, as he charged,the trusts<br />\nwere bankrolling the Republican campaign. The tenor of the Parker statement is that anything that could not be<br />\ndemonstrated, could be suspected.<br />\nRoosevelt, who had been spending the<br />\ncampaign in uncharacteristic silence,<br />\noverruled certain of his advisers and<br />\nreplied. He said that \"the silence of<br />\nself-respect\" had sealed his lips thus<br />\nfar. The President wrote with his characteristic vigor, a firming the splendid<br />\nmoral character of Cortelyou and Parker's evident failure to substantiate himself. He declared that he was controlled by no one except the people, to whom<br />\nhe sought to give \"a square deal, no<br />\nmore and no less.\" The fascinating exchange had thus far consisted of Parker's<br />\nunsubstantiated charges, followed by<br />\nRoosevelt's ringing affirmation that the<br />\n<br />\ncharges were unsubstantiated.<br />\nThe President, a consummate policician, was never shrewder than in this<br />\nreply. He issued it on the Friday evening before the elction, for release in<br />\nSaturday morning newspapers. Had he<br />\nmulled over the statement for another<br />\nday or two, the Democrats could have<br />\ncharged that the late issuance of the<br />\nPresident's rebuttal gave Parker no time<br />\nto respond. As matters stood, Parker<br />\nwould be expected to forumlate some<br />\nresponse. A renewed failure to substantiate his charges would amount to suicide.<br />\nThere was in fact material which, if<br />\nexposed, might have caused a minor sensation, such as the correspondence between the President and Edward Harriman which later agritated Senator LaFollette. Parker lacked knowledge of<br />\nthis, and his statement of sur- rebuttal<br />\n<br />\nwas poor. He declared, with ringing<br />\naccuracy, that Mr. Cortelyou had formerly been Secretary of Commerce and<br />\nLabor and was now National Chairman.<br />\n\"Now, these facts are not challenged by<br />\nthe President, nor can they be.\" Without offering much other solid fact, he<br />\ndazzlingly charged contributions \"by the<br />\ngreat monopolists for the continuance<br />\nof old favors.\" This charge is not inconceivable on its face, but Parker<br />\nshould have cited some great monopolists, some contributions and some old<br />\nfavors, if, in fact, he knew about them.<br />\nParker closed by indicating that President Roosevelt's defeat would constitute<br />\na stinging \"rebuke\" to the trusts.<br />\nThus sorrowfully closed the last gamble of Justice Parker.

In Miami<br />\nRichard M. Nixon displays during a press<br />\nconference prior to the opening of the<br />\nconvention as many faces as it is possible<br />\nfor one camera to find. Duncan's shutter<br />\ncatches Florida's governor Claude Kirk<br />\npracticing the V-for-Victory sign at the<br />\npodium before an empty convention hall-just in case he won the Republican<br />\nnomination for Vice-President, the conventioneers listening almost disinterestedly while Everett Dirksen recites the<br />\nplatform of the Republican Party for 1968,<br />\nand Richard Nixon rewriting his acceptance speech right before the photographer's lens.<br />\nThis is all very modest, very mild.<br />\nThere is even a sweet glimpse of \"young<br />\nlove\" with Julie Nixon (then engaged)<br />\nsitting prettily on the lapof David Eisenhower.<br />\nThen there is Chicago. Strewn everywhere with \"Welcome\" signs from<br />\nMayor Richard Daley, Chicago was, as<br />\nDuncan puts it, \"Something Else!\" Indeed it was. The photographs from the<br />\n<br />\nDemocratic Convention are startlingly<br />\ndifferent from those taken at the Republican Convention. It is like juxtaposing a Duerer woodcut and a pastel picture of Camelot. Humanity sweats and<br />\nstrains under eyes without sleep in front<br />\nof Duncan's Democratic camera. Faces<br />\nand hands tense and clench. The candidates are short with their words, tired<br />\nwith their eyes, and nervous with their<br />\nhands. The whole attitude is one of expectation for something unknown.<br />\n\"As the Senator(McGovern)spoke,old<br />\npro Pierre Salinger never flinched an<br />\neye. He simply fired up his cigar,<br />\nsmoothed down his riverboat gambler's<br />\nsideburns, and searched for familiar<br />\nfaces among those before him but who<br />\noffered no trace of familiarity in return.<br />\nThere was no shadow of the past -and not<br />\nthe slightest glimpse of the future, anywhere in sight.\"<br />\nAnd then the future struck. \"The cops<br />\n'rioted',\" says Duncan in his personal<br />\ncommentary. \"McCarthy-kids... hippies...yippies...TV commentators...bystanders...press photographers and anybody else caught in that first charge went<br />\ndown to their knees, or upon their faces,<br />\nor backs - down. ... flat down ... split\u2022 scalps<br />\ndown...broken-nosed down...<br />\nsmashed cameras down...\" Duncan is<br />\n<br />\nHopkins students, new and old, eat at:<br />\n<br />\nPecora's Restaurant<br />\nfor the finest itolian food in town<br />\n<br />\nsympathetic and definitely emotionally<br />\ninvolved. His pictures, too, are emotionally involved. Simplistically, there<br />\nis not a helluva lot to say about David<br />\nDouglas Duncan's book (although I suppose I have taken a good while to come<br />\naround to saying just that). You feel it.<br />\nFrom the deepest part of your gut you<br />\nturn and twist your emotions inside out<br />\nand then hang them up to dry.<br />\nThe march at Grant Park in downtown<br />\nChicago with candles and papercups and<br />\nprotest songs from another era becomes<br />\nthat sight of the future which before had<br />\nseen so lacking inDuncan's camera perspective. The hundreds who walked together slowly with their fears, shattered dreams, and hopeful tears - \"If these<br />\nbe the enemy...anarchists...hippies...<br />\nterrorists...arsonists - bless them! And<br />\ntogether, we'll start again tomorrow to<br />\nbuild something even finer from the<br />\nashes.\" This is Duncan's personal selfportrait of America, but it is millions of<br />\nother people's too.<br />\nGet this book.

The News-Letter reserves the right to<br />\nedit letters, due to space limitations. Mail<br />\nWhich is short and concise will be given priority, and stands a better chance ofgetting into<br />\nthe newspaper than lengthier correspondence.<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nYour editorial \"Connive for Complacency\" published on November 14 compels<br />\nme to try once again to set the record<br />\nstraight concerning the events leading to<br />\nlast Friday evening's panel discussion.<br />\nThis supplements my letter published<br />\non page 4 of the same issue.<br />\nBoth in the editorial and in your news<br />\nreport, you misquote me as having used \u2022<br />\nthe word \"idiot\" in reference to Dr.<br />\nPfeffer. I did not use that term during<br />\nthe office conversation on November 6 or<br />\nat any other time, it would not occur to<br />\nme so to characterize any assistant professor recruited by one of our departments, least of all a department with<br />\nWhich I am personally associated. When<br />\nyour reporter interviewed me on November 11, I stated that I had not used<br />\nthe word \"idiot,\" and I was astonished<br />\nto see it appear twice in quotation marks<br />\nin your November 14 issue.<br />\n<br />\nI did use the term \"peanut\" in responding to the argument that the invitation to<br />\nDr. Chomsky was logically identical to<br />\nan invitation to Dr. Pfeffer--that they<br />\nwere, so to speak, like interchangeable<br />\nparts of a machine. I replied that Dr.<br />\nChomsky is a well known personage of<br />\nnational stature, in comparison with<br />\nwhom Dr. Pfeffer is \"a peanut.\" I regret the use of the particular word,which<br />\nI would not have chosen in a statement<br />\nintended for publication, but neither the<br />\nthought nor its expression in the context<br />\nsummarized above justify your adjective<br />\n\"slanderous.\"<br />\nApart from this outright misquotation,<br />\nyour editorial charges me with bad faith<br />\nand duplicity in a way unwarranted by<br />\nanything in the whole episode. My original motive in suggesting the panel discussion was a feeling that people were<br />\nwearying of speeches simply saying that<br />\nthe war was a bad thing, since that is<br />\nalmost universally agreed, and the real<br />\nissue which deserved serious discussion<br />\nwas how to get out of the war.I proposed<br />\nthat faculty members reflecting a wide<br />\nrange of opinions be found to lead such a<br />\ndiscussion. The issue, incidentally, is<br />\nnot one with only two sides, as you seem<br />\nto believe.<br />\nI proposed no individuals by name,except-- in response to Manoel Rodriguez'<br />\n<br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br />\n<br />\nurging--to suggest Governor Harriman<br />\nas the one prominent and knowledgeable<br />\n<br />\nly interesting exchange of views, even<br />\nthough much of it strayed far from the<br />\noriginal theme. My only regret is that the<br />\nepisode should be clouded by the misquotation and the absurd allegations of<br />\nulterior motives printed in your journal.<br />\n<br />\nperson I thought I might persuade to come<br />\non such short notice. What made me angry<br />\nabout the invitation to Dr. Chomsky was<br />\nthe apparent change, without prior consultation, in the arrangements I had<br />\nunderstood to be fully agreed with the<br />\nstudent leaders and which! had described<br />\nto Governor Harriman when inviting him.<br />\nI had no idea in advance of the session<br />\nwhat Dr. Dinerstein's position on the<br />\nissues would turn out to be. Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nname was suggested by Messrs. Archibald and Rodriguez, and Dr. Dinerstein's<br />\nby Dr. Bevan. Nor did I originally intend<br />\nto participate myself, agreeing to do so<br />\nonly at the request of the student leaders.<br />\nIt is beyond rational understanding how<br />\nyou can construe these events as an<br />\n\"abortive ruse\" to use Dr.Pfeffer as\"a<br />\nfoil\" for Governor Harriman.<br />\n<br />\nSincerely Yours,<br />\nLincoln Gordon,<br />\n,President<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe following letter was sent to President Gordon yesterday:<br />\n\"We regret that your letter, published in the November 14 issue of the NewsLetter, has failed to affirm your respect<br />\nfor the intellectual capacity of a fellow<br />\nmember in the Hopkins community.<br />\nThe type of remarks attributed to you<br />\nwill not contribute to the possibility of<br />\na mutual confidence which the com munity<br />\nso badly needs.<br />\nBy allowing your purported disparagement of professor Pfeffer to stand, you<br />\nhave cast doubt upon the ability of your<br />\nfellow department members to evaluate<br />\ntheir peers. We can only hope that your<br />\ndiscretion will hereafter be exercised<br />\nin a more responsible manner.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn fact, from start to finish my sole interest was in helping to sponsor a serious<br />\ndiscussion of the very serious and still<br />\nunresolved question of how to get out of<br />\nthe war. I am glad to have been able to<br />\nbring to Johns Hopkins one of the best<br />\nqualified spokesmen in the country on this<br />\nsubject in the person of Governor Harriman.

In the first paragraph he states,<br />\n\"...the presence of ROTC directly hinders the training of scholars.\" How can<br />\none make such a generalized and senseless statement? Later he goes on to say,<br />\n\"but throughout its publicly recorded<br />\nhistory ROTC has been tremendously<br />\nwasteful of student effort.\" Obviously<br />\nProfessor Hartman has never spoken to<br />\nan ROTC graduate. If he would make the<br />\neffort to get some \"first-hand informa-<br />\n<br />\n**<br />\n<br />\nCorrespondence<br />\ntion,\" I'm sure he would realize the importance and the value of ROTC training<br />\nto an officer of the Armed Forces.(Upon<br />\nrequest, I'll gladly send the addresses<br />\nof a few ROTC-graduate officers presently serving on active duty). Professor<br />\nHartman also believes that \"after 2 to 4<br />\nyears of active duty,\" an ex-Army officer<br />\ncould not \"compete with students uncom mitted to active military service.\" Contrary to his opinion, it iswell-known that<br />\nex-officers of the Armed Forces are<br />\nsought after by American business and<br />\nindustry not only for their experience and<br />\nability, but for their leadership qualities<br />\nas well. Therefore, service in the Armed<br />\nForces as an officer is more of an advantage than a hindrance.<br />\n<br />\nLARRY'S MAGIC PRODUCTIONS LTD.<br />\n<br />\nPRESENTS IN BALTIMORE<br />\n<br />\nJANIS<br />\n<br />\nJOPLIN<br />\nJOE COCKER AND THE GREASE BAND<br />\n<br />\nobligations between the University ani<br />\nthe Army; it is the Army, and not the<br />\nUniversity, that must produce the required amount of ROTC enrollees. Obviously<br />\nthe contract was made solely to clarify<br />\nthat ROTC on campus is not considered<br />\nprofitable by the Secretary of the Army<br />\nunless twenty-five or more students<br />\ngraduate as officers. Furthermore, the<br />\nUniversity suffers no fine or penalty if<br />\nthe required number of officers is not<br />\nmaintained. I would also like to remind<br />\nProfessor Hartman that the Army does<br />\nnot solicit, recruit or cajole students to<br />\njoin ROTC;in fact, the SDS has afar<br />\nmore extensive membership campaign.<br />\nConcerning financial matters and<br />\nROTC, Professor Hartman quotes the<br />\ncomparatively high number of Army<br />\nscholarship students at Hopkins and<br />\nquestions if they are \"selectively admitt-<br />\n<br />\nI will pay<br />\nhandsomely<br />\nfor 2 tickets<br />\nto the Rolling<br />\nStones' Concert<br />\n--call Dick<br />\n329-6305<br />\n<br />\ned.\" As a scholarship recipient, I can<br />\nassure Professor Hartman that the Army<br />\nhas no influence on college acceptances<br />\n(during Orientation Week in September<br />\nI found that both the Registrar's Office<br />\nand the Office of Financial Aid had no<br />\nrecord of my award). Also, since ROTC<br />\nscholarship candidates are competively<br />\nchosen, it is evident that an academically outstanding school like Hopkins will<br />\nhave a greater percentage of scholarship<br />\nstudents. Professor Hartmanwould like<br />\nto see ROTC abolished at Hopkins, which<br />\nwould force the scholaFship students to<br />\nattend schools other than Hopkins. \"Enrollment of these students elsewhere<br />\nwould be to Hopkins great benefit.\" How<br />\nis this so, Professor Hartman? Not even<br />\none advantage has been stated for the<br />\nabolishment of ROTC on campus.<br />\nTherefore I ask: can anyone state at<br />\nleast one positive advantage for the<br />\nabolishment of ROTC??<br />\n<br />\nIf You're 18...or over<br />\nn\u2022 = r.;<br />\n\"<br />\n1 Q.<br />\n<br />\nc< 3 m'<br />\n<br />\n0 0z 2<br />\n<br />\nBITTIIIIMD BLUES BIND<br />\nAND SPECIAL GUEST ATTRACTION<br />\n<br />\n\"I do not feel that the University should<br />\nhave a contractural obligationto produce<br />\n'a minimum of twenty-five officers per<br />\nyear.\" Professor Hartman has completely reversed the true contractural<br />\n<br />\nc_ c<br />\n<br />\na 0_ c)<br />\n..... \u2014<br />\n<br />\nFrom the country<br />\nthat gave you,<br />\n\"I A WOMAN,\"<br />\n\"INGA\" and<br />\n\"I AM CURIOUS<br />\n<br />\nCharles & 34th St<br />\n\u2022 1 4111 411-1 41 i Il 1I 41<br />\n<br />\nJAll<br />\nI<br />\nWORKSHOP<br />\n<br />\nm 5 ...

Mr. Amsler<br />\ngot through the first paragraph without<br />\na mistake, but his errors begin with the<br />\nstatement that this is Barthelme's second<br />\nbook. It is, in fact, his third, the first<br />\nbeing a collection of stories,Come Back,<br />\nDoctor Caligari, which no doubt Mr.<br />\nAmsler in his search for the superficially<br />\nprofound will find tedious and a suitable<br />\ntarget begging for a put-down, even<br />\nthough it is much older than its relatively<br />\nYounger brother. One question is raised:<br />\nwhy review at this time a book that was<br />\npublished almost two years ago in this<br />\nseason when one has such an enticing<br />\ntarget as The Love Machine?<br />\nMr. Amsler is, of course, welcome<br />\nto his opinion, but I feel that Barthelme<br />\nwrites beautifully in a spare and innovative style that details absurd incidents of<br />\nmodern life, yet produces the menace,<br />\nennui, hysteria and hilarity by implication. The neglect to mention the number<br />\nof short stories concerned with war and<br />\npeople's reactions to war is a major<br />\noversight since Barthelme discusses the<br />\n<br />\nsame. Sorry, but that's the way it is.<br />\nNonetheless, I would like to concur<br />\nwith Mr. Krieger in something he pointed out in his letter and which I evidently failed to make clear in my review. By<br />\nall means,anyone interested in the structure and development of the contemporary short store and novelette should<br />\ndefinitely read Donald Barthelme.<br />\n<br />\nVietnam conflict with scathing wit and<br />\nand insight in a day (1967) when it was<br />\nstill not terribly fashionable to be antiwar, much less a writer of fiction indicating the nature of the war. Barthelme,<br />\nhowever, did not resort to the cliches that<br />\none finds so often in the work of those<br />\nwho have decided that committment in<br />\nthat area is demanded of the modern<br />\nauthor.<br />\nMr. Amsler confuses the surface<br />\nfrivolity in the work with the underlying<br />\nintent and meaning. One wonders how he<br />\nwould react to the poem of e.e.cum mings.<br />\nJoh n lleParland<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n\u201e<br />\nI would like to acknowledge Elliott<br />\nKrieger's letter to the News-Letter<br />\n(November 14). He is indeed quite right,<br />\nand my research not extensive enough,<br />\nto discover that Unspeakable Practices,<br />\nUnnatural Acts is Donald Barthelme's<br />\nthird, not second book. I stand corrected.<br />\nHowever, I have just one thing to say<br />\nconcerning Mr. Krieger's accusation/<br />\nsuggestion that I \"might read beyond the<br />\ncover pages of Snow ll'hite.\"I had read<br />\nSnow White before I even commenced a<br />\nreview of Barthelme's latest book and<br />\nmy opinion of Snow White remains the<br />\n<br />\ngrasping these works,a new way of meeting them on some sort of mutual fertile<br />\nground and grabbing a huge handful of<br />\ntheir good rich soil.<br />\nI appreciate Mr. Krieger's interest<br />\nand concern. Would that others took the<br />\ntime to be so. I hope that we might be<br />\nable to continue some sort of dialogue<br />\nvia the News-Letter concerning the<br />\nissues raised by Mr. Krieger and Mr.<br />\nFielder concerning the need for a \"new<br />\nnew criticism.''<br />\n<br />\nAs a last item, there is an interesting<br />\narticle in this month's Mayboy(Decernber, 1969) by Leslie Fielder entitled<br />\nCross the Border, Close the Gap. A well<br />\nknown literary critic, Mr. Fielder discusses in his eassay the need for what<br />\nhe calls a \"newnew criticism.\" He points<br />\nout that much of our contemporary fiction-particularly Norman Mailer and<br />\nAllen Ginsberg (and for that matter,<br />\nDonald Barthelme) - needs to be viewed<br />\nand interpreted on a plane differentfrom<br />\nthe generated by the works of such<br />\nwriters as Joyce, Mann, Proust, Eliot,<br />\nand Pound. These latter figures wrote<br />\nwith a style and manner which invited<br />\nacademic scholasticism and genteel dialectic. But as we approach the 1970's, the<br />\nworld of literary fiction is beset by the<br />\nunlabeled power of Mailer, the violent<br />\nlyricism of Ginsberg, and the art/antiart of such people as Barthelme and<br />\nKerouac. We urgently need a new way of<br />\n<br />\nMark imsler<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI call your attention to the rubber<br />\nstamping on the evenlope which states<br />\nsimply STOP THE WAR NOW.<br />\nI am using this on all checks, invoices<br />\nand the envelopes of all correspondence<br />\nthat leaves my house--both business and<br />\npersonal. My hope is to constantly remind<br />\nthat not all objections to the war in Viet<br />\nNam are coming from young people.<br />\nThis sentiment has been beautifully expressed by Gerald W. Johnson and, expensively, in the courageous letter to<br />\nCardinal Sheehan by Joseph Mack.<br />\nI ask all who sare these peaceful sentiments to make use of this simple and<br />\ninexpensive method.<br />\n<br />\nMyra 1)u nn .1an s<br />\n<br />\nVisiting Baltimore?

The NewsLetter or one was responsible for the regrettable Franklin and Marshall article. Walter Herman, former voluntary sports publicity director and alleged associate of Sydnor's wrote a less than complimentary article for the News\u2014American after the Carnegie-Mellon<br />\nloss. Coupled with this regretful negative journalism has been constant<br />\nstudent cynicism and belittlement of the Blue Jay Varsity gridders.<br />\nUndoubtedly, those who sneer the most at accomplishment or its<br />\nlack on the athletic field are also the ones who do most to hurt the<br />\nUniversity's attempts to improve the athletic teams.<br />\n<br />\nIncident in Press Box<br />\nAn example of this is one student who was making derogatory remarks in the pressbox during the Swarthmore football game. Unbeknowst to this student-critic, Coach Jim Valvano was also there with<br />\na basketball prospect. Here, on the one hand, we have a coach trying<br />\nto sell a student on Hopkins, and on the other a student cutting down<br />\nthe University and its sports teams. Competition for good studentathletes is hard enough without this derogatory attitude.<br />\nDerision of Hopkins is not limited to the sports scene. It is but one<br />\nsegment of a larger, more widespread \"negativism.\" This leads into<br />\nthe second part of my editorial. In fact, I find nothing more irritating<br />\nthan a group of self-appointed critics\u2014students, faculty, administrators, coaches or anyone else for that matter--sitting around on<br />\nFriday afternoon nit-picking at the failings of the News-Letter.<br />\nSuch aimless non-constructive criticism is a waste of enery. Valid<br />\ncriticism, such as of the News-Letter's F & M article, which was an<br />\nunfortunate mistake and for which I, as Sports Editor, owe both the<br />\nteam and Coach Sotir an apology, is welcome.<br />\n<br />\nLoudmouth Critics<br />\nYet the loudmouth student-critics of the News-Letter, Hopkins in<br />\ngeneral, the Hopkins' athletics in particular could better serve themselves and the Hopkins community if they would contribute responsibly<br />\nto the News-Letter and try to correct what they think are \"faults\" in<br />\nit.<br />\nI am not saying criticism itself is bad, but it is valuable only if constructive. Anyone can tear down; building is the difficult part. If you<br />\ndon't think so, ask Coach Sotir who four years ago practically had to<br />\nstart from scratch to build a winning team.<br />\nThe News-Letter is a student newspaper,we aim to offer a responsible avenue of communication and information to the Hopkins community. Where we feel there is a wrong such as the University's admissions policy to athletic events, it is our editorial obligation and<br />\nduty to expose it. The Sports pages are in intregral part of these aims.<br />\nIn late January, the News-Letter plans to go twice-weekly which<br />\nmeans we'll need more sportswriters and reporters to give the University responsible coverage it deserves.<br />\nI ask you to join the News-Letter team. To borrow Jim Sydnor's<br />\nword, we are disparaged too.<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\nHOMEWOOD, Nov. 21, 1 96)<br />\n<br />\nBlue Jays Outplay Dickinson<br />\nWith Solid Defense, Running<br />\nJohns Hopkins' football team continued to look<br />\nlike a small college gridiron powerhouse with a<br />\ndetermined effort against Dickinson College at<br />\nCarlisle last Saturday. The Jays won 28-14 in<br />\na contest that was more one-sided than the score<br />\nindicates.<br />\nPrior to the game against Hopkins, Dickinson<br />\nranked 13 in the nation in college football defense.<br />\nThey had allowed an average of only 177 yards<br />\ngained against them while posting a 4-3 record.<br />\nThe Jays came alive, after two shutout defeats, in the third quarter of the Swarthmore<br />\ngame on Nov. 8. The opening series of downs<br />\nagainst Dickinson looked like Swarthmore's fateful third quarter re-lived. Charlie Coker returned the opening kickoff 25 yards to Hopkins 35.<br />\nOn first down Bob Pfeifer hit Bill Donovan for<br />\n32 yards, and fired to Steve Latson for nine<br />\nmore. Steve Hata hit the right side of the line<br />\nfor three tough yards and Dan Augustine bulled<br />\nthe ball across the goal line five plays later.<br />\n<br />\nDefense Holds<br />\nHopkins defense held Dickinson on downs and<br />\nCoker took the punt on Hopkins 31. Augustine<br />\nwent over left tackle for ten yards and on the<br />\nfollowing play, sophomore running back Joe Ciesloi,vski took the second handoff on a double reverse and raced with it to the Dickinson endzone. The TD was called back and 15 yards were<br />\nassessed for a holding penalty against Hopkins.<br />\nThe Jays gave the ball up on downs and with third<br />\nand two yards to go on Hopkins 40 yard line, Dickinson's speedy halfback John West spurted past<br />\nthe Hopkins secondary for Dickinson's first score.<br />\nThe rest of the first quarter was spent inside<br />\nthe Hopkins 20 yard line. Before the half, Dickinson had seven opportunities to score from good<br />\nfield position. A great pass rush produced by<br />\nDoug Hain, Paul Weiss and Mark Curtis together<br />\nwith the blanket coverage by the proud, Szabocoached secondary stopped the Dickinson advance<br />\ncold. The score at the half was Hopkins eight,<br />\nDickinson seven.<br />\n<br />\nJays Owned Half<br />\nThe second half belonged to Hopkins. Again the<br />\ndefense stopped seven drives while the offense<br />\ncame alive with solid blocking and smart running.<br />\nHopkins scored on their second series of downs<br />\n<br />\nIn the second half.<br />\nSteve Utz led the charge with a 65 yard jaunt<br />\naround right end. Workhorse Augustine punched<br />\nfor 12 more yards and Hata pushed it across.<br />\nA game Dickinson team tied the score on the<br />\nnext series but the tie was short lived.<br />\nCoker returned the kickoff 40 yards to the Dickinson 47. Augustine bolted left end, cracked the<br />\nmiddle, cracked the middle, cracked the middle,<br />\ncracked the middle.... and Hopkins was ahead to<br />\nstay.<br />\n<br />\nJays Made Ball Move<br />\nThe Jays kept the ball on the ground for the<br />\nrest of the game and made it move. The Hopkins<br />\noffense scored again to open the fourth quarter.<br />\nSecond down and ten on the Hopkins 30, Steve<br />\nUtz broke around left end for 25 yards on the<br />\nstrength of a block thrown by Steve Hata. Hata<br />\nhit the middle for five yards and Utz went over<br />\nleft tackle for forty yards and the touchdown.<br />\nDickinson attempted a late quarter passing<br />\nattack that drove the ball to the Hopkins 38.<br />\nCenter linebacker Jim McMenamin intercepted a<br />\npass on the Blue Jays own 22 yard line and raced<br />\nit back to the Dickinson 36. The Jays punched<br />\nthe ball to the Dickinson six before the final<br />\nwhistle.<br />\n<br />\nUtz Ground Leader<br />\nSophomore running back Steve Utz led the rushing attack with 151 yards in 13 carries and one<br />\ntouchdown, Dan Augustine gained 119 yards in 24<br />\ntries and logged two TD's, and Steve Hata covered 90 yards in 15 attempts.<br />\nIn all, Hopkins recorded 358 net yards against<br />\nthe 13th toughest college defense in the nation<br />\nwhile the defense allowed only 218 total yards,<br />\nboth passing and rushing for Dickinson.<br />\nIt was an impressive performance for a team<br />\nthat has had trouble finding itself. The win brought<br />\nHopkins at least a piece of its third straight conference crown.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on tomorrow's opponent, Coach Sotir remarked: \"They've lost some<br />\nvery tough games this year. Their record doesn't<br />\nshow their ability.\" Presently, the Green Terrors<br />\nfrom Westminster,Maryland show a 2-6 mark.But<br />\nin the MAC, they log a dismal 1-4 record.<br />\n(Continued on page 17)<br />\n<br />\nVarsity Soccer Posts 6-2-2 Mark<br />\nAs Jays Tie Western Maryland<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Tuesday, the Varsity Soccer team finished a successful 6-2-2 season by tying another<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference team, Western Maryland, by the score of 0-0. The game was bitterly<br />\nfought by both sides, and demonstrated once again<br />\nthe strength of the Hopkins' defense,playing without the constant checking and hard hitting of John<br />\nClisham, truly the defensive leader of the team.<br />\nSteve Weiss again made several incredible saves,<br />\nwhile Rick Tobey, Gavin Youngquist and Rob Parsley made up well for Clisham's loss.<br />\nThe offense, though, could not seem to gel,<br />\nas it had done against Drexel the previous Saturday. In this game, the offense, led by Scott Tyner, had posted two goals, and had achieved only<br />\nHopkins' second victory over Drexel in 13 meetings. Yet, as captain Randy Miller said, \"We've<br />\nalways had a strong defense, as is evidenced by<br />\nour six shutouts this year. Frequently, however,<br />\nwe just weren't able to put together enough shots<br />\non goal to win a few more games and maybe the<br />\nconference title.\"<br />\nIn the game last Tuesday,Hopkins had few shots<br />\non goal, though there were a couple good crosses<br />\nin front of the net by samper and Tyner, and one<br />\n<br />\ncontroversial shot by Miller off the goalpost.<br />\nReally, it wasn't till the first overtime period<br />\nthat the Jays, led on by the crowd's cher ring, tried<br />\nto win it all by keeping the ball in front of Western<br />\nMaryland's net. Despite their inability to score<br />\nin the closing minutes, the team showed the good<br />\nspirit and agressiveness, which have been evident<br />\nthroughout this past season.<br />\nThis aspect of the team was mirrored in Coach<br />\nKnauff's remarks at the end of last Tuesday's<br />\ngame, when he said, \"It was a great pleasure for<br />\nme to coach this team and to be connected with<br />\nits success this season. The boys worked hard<br />\nall year, frequently striving above their normal<br />\nability to win or tie games. I can just say that<br />\nI am very pleased, and that every member on<br />\nthe team deserves a lot of credit for our fine<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nSuch players as Danny Hall, Albee Samper,Pat<br />\nBarry, and Gavin Youngquist, truly do deserve<br />\na lot of credit, in addition to the regulars, for<br />\nkeeping the team going when it was plagued by<br />\nInjuries. The players form the strong nucleus<br />\nof next year's team, which should continue to<br />\nbe a strong MAC contender.<br />\n(Continued on page 181<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, Nov. 21, 1969<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n'PAGE 17<br />\n<br />\nsportsFrosh Football Ends Season on Winning Note<br />\nThe Freshmen Football team finished<br />\nits season last Friday with a26 to 16 win<br />\nover the Junior Varsity team of Western<br />\nMaryland. Hopkins scored early on an<br />\neighty-five yard sustained drive. The<br />\nscore was made by quarterback Jim Pitts<br />\non a thirty yard sneak over center. The<br />\nFrosh could not make the conversion<br />\nhowever and led 6 to 0.<br />\nThe Freshman quickly added another<br />\ntally on a short sweep by tailback Harry<br />\nTheis, here again the conversion attempt<br />\nfailed. The final Hopkins score of the<br />\nhalf was a Pitts to Tim Wiglecki pass.<br />\nThis time fullback Pat Neary scored the<br />\nconversion to give the Frosh a 20 to 0<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe defense, who had been playing<br />\nwithout error, now began to let down<br />\nand gave Western Maryland a touchdown<br />\nbefore the half ended. The Freshmen<br />\ntook a 20 to 8 lead into the locker room.<br />\n<br />\nBy the second half, the rain had stopped<br />\nbut the field was a sea of mud. Hopkins<br />\nscored on a two yard plunge by Neary.<br />\nThe touchdown was set up by a Western<br />\nMaryland fumble. Western Maryland<br />\nscored once more late in the game but<br />\n\"cooked their own goose\" in doing so.<br />\nIt took them eight minutes to score on a<br />\nsustained drive which just about used up<br />\nthe clock.<br />\nHopkins had 93 yards in the air. They<br />\nhad almost 200 yards rushing with tailback Theis accounting for 97 yards. Pitts<br />\nhad 66 yards on the gnound, and Hal Altman and Neary had 30 yards apiece.<br />\n<br />\nSeason a Success<br />\nIn posting a 4-1 record, the freshman<br />\nfootball team has been lavished with much<br />\npraise by Coach Bob Scott. Scott remarked, \"I was very pleased with the effort<br />\nof this year's freshman squad. It is one<br />\n<br />\nJay Gridders to Face Green Terrors<br />\n(Continued from page 16)<br />\nA word of caution must be interjected.<br />\nWestern Maryland lost a 16-15 heartbreaker to Hampden-Sydney. The same<br />\nteam that beat Hopkins 32-0. The Terrors were beaten by a safety with less<br />\nthan a minute to play, or else they would<br />\nhave won 15-14.<br />\nCoach Sotir is quick to add that the<br />\n\u2022 present Blue Jay team is not the same<br />\nas the one who lost to Hampden-Sydney.<br />\nHe called the Dickinson game \"a total<br />\nteam victory\". He also notes, \"If we<br />\nhad played as well against everyone as<br />\nwe did against Dickinson, we would have<br />\ngiven anybody on our schedule a good<br />\nfight. We'd almost surely be better than<br />\n5 and 3, but that's past history. Tomorrow's game is the important thing.\"<br />\n\"It means everything to them and to<br />\nus. Although we've got a third of the<br />\nchampionship, we can take all of it with<br />\na win.\"<br />\n<br />\nTerrors Riding High<br />\nLast year's co-captain and present<br />\nfreshman assistant coach, Don Yablonowitz, mentioned that \"Western Maryland always gets up for the Hopkins<br />\ngame. Their record is not a true indication.\"<br />\nIn preparation for tomorrow's contest, Sotir cites four Western Maryland-<br />\n<br />\ners who the Blue Jays will be particularly interested in stopping. Senior guarterback Bruce Bozman,no. 16,is considered to be \"one of the best quarterback<br />\nin the MAC.\" He has always done well<br />\nagainst Hopkins. Last year against the<br />\nJays, he was responsible for over 200<br />\nyards as he rushed for one touchdown<br />\nand scored another. This was two-thirds<br />\nof Maryland's offensive punch.<br />\nAt one of the running back slots is<br />\nfreshman Joe Brockmeyer, no. 32. At<br />\n165 pounds, he is not especially big, but<br />\nhe is still dangerous. Several times<br />\nthis year he has gained over a hundred<br />\nyards rushing.<br />\nTwo very good ends compliment Bozman, Randy Klinger, no. 85, at 6-2 and<br />\n190 pounds and Ed Brown, no. 84, at 6-4<br />\nand 220 pounds. The two gave the Terros an excellent passing attack.<br />\nIn the last two games the defense has<br />\ndone an excellent job. Dickinson's two<br />\ntouchdowns were flukes. At any rate<br />\ntomorrow at two o'clock on Homewood<br />\nField the defense will again be called on<br />\nto shut off Western Maryland and turn<br />\nthe ball over to Bob Pfiefer and the rest<br />\nof the offense.<br />\nLast year the Black and Blue struck<br />\nWestern Maryland with a 46-23 defeat.<br />\nThe scoring probably won't be as high<br />\nas last year, but a Blue Jay victory can<br />\nbe predicted,<br />\n<br />\nof the top freshman teams of recent years.<br />\nof the top freshman teams of recent<br />\nyears. The guys were really primed for<br />\nthis one. It was our best effort of the season. F & M had been undefeated up until<br />\nwe met them.\"<br />\nIn scoring 127 points, the offense averaged slightly better than 25 points a game.<br />\nQuarterback Jim Pitts was responsible<br />\nfor much of the scoring. He threw 10<br />\ntouchdown passes and ran for 2 in the<br />\nfive game season. At 6-2 and 185 pounds<br />\nhe has good size for a quarterback. He<br />\ncompleted 62 passes out of 133 attempted<br />\nfor a 46.6 completion percentage. He<br />\npassed for 870 yards in five games.<br />\nIn the words of Coach Scott, \"he did an<br />\nexcellent job for us.\"<br />\n<br />\nWeglicki Leading Receiver<br />\nHis primary receiver was Tim Weglicki who scored 8 touchdowns. Weglicki<br />\nhad 37 receptions for 583 yards. His<br />\n51 points placed him first among the<br />\nscorers. He was also singled out by Scott<br />\nfor his excellent job this year. Tight end<br />\nCarroll Phillips was second among receivers with 10 receptions for 156 yards<br />\nand one touchdwon. Joe Konopelski was<br />\na back up offesnvie and defensive end.<br />\na back up offensive and defensive end.<br />\nSecond in scoring was fullback Pat<br />\nNeary. He had 3 touchdown and two conversions for 22 points. Also, with 3 six pointers was the leading ground gainer<br />\nHarry Thies rushed for 383 yards in 81<br />\ncarrries for a 4.7 per carry average.<br />\nScott mentioned the good blocking<br />\nof the interior lineman. Sam Palmisano<br />\nthe center had guards Joe Ouslander and<br />\nFrank Bond to help with the blocking.<br />\nSteve Jefferies and Mike Seider, both<br />\ntackles turned in good season performances.<br />\n<br />\nHe shared the wingback slot with Hal Altman who was a safety on defense.

Since then, the plan<br />\nhas painstakingly gone through discussion and recommendation stages in the<br />\nSchool of Medicine, School of Public<br />\nHealth and Hygiene and the Faculty of<br />\nArts and Sciences. It will soon be before the policy-making Advisory Boards<br />\nof the Medical and Hygiene Schools.<br />\nIn a faculty memorandum last month<br />\nsummarizing the Allied Health proposal,<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon stated that<br />\n\"the University should estbalish baccalaureate and master's programs in the<br />\nallied health sciences to which students<br />\nwould normally be recruited at the conclusion of their undergraduate sophomore year, having completed stated prerequisites especially in the scientific<br />\nfields.\"<br />\nThese transfer students would enter a<br />\n\"College of Health Sciences\" to complete<br />\na combined baccalaureate-master's degree in either three or four years, according<br />\nto Gordon's<br />\nmemo. The<br />\n<br />\n\"College\" would be located near the East<br />\nBaltimore medical institutions, and<br />\nwould train nurses and non-doctoral<br />\nmedical personnel.<br />\nImplementation of the Allied Health<br />\nplan, however, will be contingent upon<br />\ngathering new financial resources for the<br />\nprogram, stated Dr. Bevan. Fundsfrom<br />\nthe Federal Government, from the National Institute of Health and from private<br />\nsources will be tapped,Bevan remarked,<br />\nto begin the division.<br />\nIf such funds are not available, the institution of the Allied Health College will<br />\nbe delayed. President Gordon previously<br />\nannounced that money allocated to existing programs will not be touched to start<br />\nthe new school and that the University,<br />\npresently running this year $4 million in<br />\nthe red, cannot afford additional expenditures without more money.<br />\n<br />\nThe Rationale<br />\nThe rationale behind an Allied Health<br />\ndivision at Hopkins was to train medical<br />\ntechnicians who would absorb many of<br />\nthe functions now performed by doctors.<br />\n\"Doctors do a lot of things that don't<br />\nneed to be done by doctors,\" Bevan explained, \"and what we have in mind is a<br />\nwhole new type of medical personnel who<br />\nwould take over many of their jobs.\"<br />\nThrough this process, Bevan claimed,<br />\nthe quantity of qualified medical personnel would be increased without greatly<br />\nexpanding the number of medical schools<br />\nin the nation. \"Given the present character of medical education, it is impossible to increase the output of doctors<br />\nwithout starting more medical schools<br />\n<br />\nwhich is extremely costly, and the<br />\ngovernment just doesn't seem to have<br />\nthe money,\" he asserted.<br />\nThree major questions have been posed<br />\nby the opponents of the Allied Health<br />\nplan: why not expand the medical school<br />\nto produce more doctors instead of starting something new, how will a non-doctoral program attract highly - qualified<br />\nstudents, what financial drain will the<br />\nprogram place on the University and<br />\ncould this training function be performed<br />\nby existing trade or vocational schools?<br />\n\"One hears from many medical<br />\nexperts that we are in a near-crisis situation in the medical profession,\" maintained Dr. Francis Carlson professor of<br />\nbiophysics, \"and we should train more<br />\ndoctors instead of starting another baccalaureate program.\" He stated that<br />\nsince a shortage of doctors is now affecting the country,Hopkins, which specializes in such training, should expand its<br />\nmedical school enrollment. \"According<br />\nto the Association of American Medical<br />\nColleges, there are 22,000 filed applications for med schools and 10,000 are admittee each year. We should begin to tap<br />\nthese 12,000 students who have already<br />\nreceived a undergraduate degree before<br />\ntrying to attract a whole new set of<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nDr. Donald Kerr of Physics feared<br />\nthat the quality of academic instruction<br />\nwould be lowered if Hopkins began training more nurses and medical technicians.<br />\n\"I don't like taking on a lower grade of<br />\nacademic people,\" Kerr remarked. Furthermore, he noted, a new division within the University cannot help but financia-<br />\n<br />\nDR. WILLIAM BE VAN<br />\nlly hurt the other divisions. \"I would<br />\nthink they would have to take some money<br />\naway from existing programs to finance<br />\nthis,\" he added. the Physics professor<br />\nstated that it is not Hopkins' role to train<br />\nnon-doctors.<br />\nDr. Bevan, however, who will be<br />\ndirectly responsible for the new program, claimed that the Allied Health<br />\nprogram has been misinterpreted, and<br />\ntherefore misrepresented, by its opponents. \"We've been trapped by semantics,\" he declared. \"What we have in<br />\nmind is a whole new type of medical<br />\npersonnel who would become specialists<br />\nIn fields a general practitioner may not<br />\nknow much about.\"<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nFuture Plans<br />\nThe Vietnam Moratorium Committe, which organized<br />\nthe October 15th anti-war demonstrations, but stayed in<br />\nthe background this past weekend, has returned to the<br />\nforefront by announcing plans for December demonstrations.<br />\nSam Brown, a chief spokesman of the committee, announced plans for three days of nationwide protest activities, on December 12, 13, and 24. All of the demonstrations will be local, with no large rallies planned for<br />\nthe near future.<br />\nActivities planned include the leafleting of Christmas shoppers, and public vigils on Christmas eve.

Archibald is the President of the Student Association and one<br />\nof the movement's proponents.<br />\nThe plan was formulated following the<br />\nestablishment of the Johns Hopkins Urban<br />\nAffairs Center \"in recognition of the<br />\nUniversity's responsibility to the needs<br />\nof the Baltimore Community.\" The<br />\nadministration simultaneously implemented an Urban Affairs course of study<br />\nin the Social and Behaviorial Sciences,<br />\nsupplemented by related courses in<br />\nSocial Relations, Geography, Environmental Engineering, Economics,History<br />\nand Education.<br /><br />\nBlueprint for Change<br />\nHowever, as a result of inefficient<br />\nplanning and the desire on the part of<br />\na group of students led by Archibald,<br />\nSam Katz, Ron Remick, Paul Allen and<br />\nHarry Singleton to \"keep pace with new<br />\ndevelopments in the area,\" a new blueprint for an Urban Affairs Concentrate<br />\nwas drafted. The students then met with<br />\nprominent people from the Social Relations Department and the Center to discuss the recommendations. Both Archibald and Dean Swanson, who sat in on the<br />\nmeeting, described the discussion as<br />\nfruitful.<br />\nThe proposals incorporate three basic<br />\nrecommendations: seminars dealingwith<br />\npoverty, health problems, physical planning, crime, and delinquency will be<br />\noffered.

It was believed guest<br />\nlesturers from the academic and local<br />\ncommunities could be obtained, at a low<br />\ncost. However, Archibald now feels the<br />\nsymposium to be \"improbable\" because<br />\nof a lack of funds.<br />\nThe third proposal, a work/study internship,will be included in order to provide a student with the opportunity to<br />\nlearn about the political aspects of urban<br />\naffairs while he receives academic credit<br />\nor a salary.<br /><br />\nDean Carl P. Swanson, who sat in on a meeting with the Social Relations<br />\nDepartment and the Urban Affairs Center, called the session \"fruitful\".<br /><br />\nThis proposal was made last year by<br />\nD'Alesandro in a<br />\nThomas<br />\nMayor<br />\nNews-Letter interview. D'Alesandro<br />\nstated that \"The fact' that we hold public<br />\noffice doesn't give us any cornerstone<br />\non knowledge. We are the center of some<br />\nfine educational institutions, like Hopkins<br />\nand the rest, and I would like to see them<br />\nallocate to me, as Mayor, some of their<br />\nbest brainpower--not only faculty but<br />\nstudents as well, on the order of the White<br />\nHouse Fellowships.\"<br />\nThe faculty, at the time, expressed<br />\nagreement with the general principles<br />\nof the proposal but noted several difficulties.

DiFebo and Claxton point out that<br />\n1231 has been organizing at Hopkins<br />\nsince March, whereas 1199 has only<br />\nshown interest since the signing of the<br />\nConsent Election Agreement.<br />\nPunch criticizes 1231's arguments<br />\non the grounds that 1199, although new<br />\nto the Baltimore area, has been<br />\nbusy<br />\nsuccessfully organizing previously \"untouchable\" non-professional workers at<br />\nnumerous local hospitals and nursing<br />\nhomes, including Hopkins, Sinai, Franklin Square, Maryland General, Levindale, and the Jewish Convalescent Home.<br />\nWith more than 5,000 members, all organized within the year, Punch questions<br />\nthe accusation that his union would<br />\nwant<br />\nto raid for the sake of raiding.<br />\n\"The only thing that a union organizer<br />\nshould organize for is that he wants<br />\nto<br />\nchange the working conditions of workers,\" Punch states. \"No other reason<br />\nis valid in my book.\"<br /><br />\nexcept something that's trying to get on<br />\nthe books as a union.\"<br />\nLocal 1199 has already won an election at Hopkins Hospital and is now in<br />\nthe process of negotiating a contract<br />\nthere. \"The University and the Hospital are closely alligned, \"Punch states.<br />\n\"It would be detrimental to the workers<br />\nat the Hospital for someone to come<br />\nin and organize the University employees<br />\nand settle for a contract below our standards.\"<br />\nLocal 1199's standard economic demands center on a minimum salary rate<br />\nof $100 per week for the lowest category of employees, pension and welfare<br />\nprograms with co-ntributions from the<br />\nemployer and a minimum of twelve days<br />\nannual sick leave in ad lition to paid vacations.<br />\nPunch regards Local 1231's organizing campaign as \"suspicious\" because<br />\nthe University has not put up a fight.<br />\n\"If Jim Claxton had not gotten a consent election so quietly and easily,\" he<br />\nstates, \"we would not be petitioning for<br />\nan election at Hopkins. We don't organize that way. We only organize when<br />\nworkers are willing and ready to move....<br />\nWe don't contact the administration, until we contact the workers first.\"<br /><br />\nMembers Complained<br />\nLocal 1199 did not begin waging concerted organizing campaign at Hopkins<br />\nuntil its members complained that they<br />\nwould be forced to choose between 1231<br />\nand no union at all, under the current<br />\nconsent election accord. In the past,<br />\nPunch has viewed Hopkins employees as<br />\n\"terribly intimidated\"--too intimidated<br />\nto act, and too intimidated to be organized. He points to the ill-fated Homewood<br />\nGrievance Committee, \"which<br />\ncould have been a good thing,if the workers had made it a good thing.\"<br />\nPunch takes the position that \"no boss<br />\nmeans a worker a damn bit of good....<br /><br />\nLife and Death<br />\nHe maintains that \"1231 is in trouble<br />\nbecause they haven't organized anyone<br />\nelse around here.

In its October 15 meeting, the<br />\nCouncil urged the General Assembly to<br />\ndeal with governance in a two step prdeal with governance in a two step process. First, it was recommended that the<br />\nAssembly form a committee to survey<br /><br />\nHopkins employees workinglate hours in the library. The workers will vote on December 5 on the<br />\nquestion of unionization.<br />\nphoto by hoffinann<br />\neven in the case of the so-called nonprofit-making institutions.

No deals.<br />\nNo compromises.\"<br />\n\"It seems that for some reason or<br />\nanother,\" Punch observes, \"the University has decided that it's not going<br />\nto be so bad living with 1231. If its<br />\nnot too bad living with 1231, then I don't<br />\nsee that the workers are going to be<br />\ndoing too cool.\"<br />\nThe Hopkins administration has adopted an official public posture of neutra-<br /><br />\nlity towards 1231, in accordance with<br />\nits new labor relations policy. The policy which sets forth the aim of the<br />\nUniversity \"to be a good employer,\"<br />\nevolved during the early stages of 1231's<br />\norganizing campaign, and was approved<br />\nby University President Lincoln Gordon<br />\nand the Board of Trustees.<br />\nThe policy statement, which was made<br />\npublic along with the Consent Election<br />\nAgreement on October 29 states that<br />\n\"the university recognizes the right of<br />\nits employees to organize in appropriate<br />\ngroups for the purpose of collective<br />\nbargaining....<br />\n\"In. the event that a duly constituted<br />\ngroup of employees should be formed as<br />\na result of a secret ballot election conducted under impartial supervision, the<br />\nuniversity will recognize such a group<br />\nand negotiate with it in good faith.\"<br /><br />\nBookstore Changes Ways;<br />\nSecurity Guards Might Go<br />\nStudents in search of books for second<br />\nsemester courses may have an easier<br />\ntime of it as compared with the frustrations of last semester, accordingto Dean<br />\nRobert Strider, Chairman of the Bookstore Committee.<br />\nStrider declared this week that his<br />\ncommittee will be meeting weekly in the<br />\ncoming months to implement proposals<br />\nfor improving the book center. Their<br />\nactions will be based on a report concerning bookstore operations prepared<br />\nrecently by efficiency experts from Peat,<br />\nMarwick, Mitchell and Co.The efficiency<br />\nstudy cost the University approximately<br />\n$4500, according to Strider.<br />\nThe report divided its recommendations into six general areas: organization, personnel, physical outlay, accounting procedures and inventory handling.<br />\nMajor recommendations included a reevaluation of the Book Center's position<br />\nwithin the University and a streamlining<br />\nof its inventory procedures.<br />\nLauren Walters, Secretary of the S.C., criticized the cumbersome way in which the Faculty Assembly is handling the question of university governance.<br /><br />\nthe campus; to see if governance reform<br />\nwas widely supported. If the need for reform were demonstrated, the committee<br />\nwould recommend to the Council \"the<br />\ncomposition of and charge to a body to<br />\npropose appropriate revisisions in the<br />\nmechanisms for policy formulations.\"<br />\nTo<br />\nWalters, the two step process<br />\nseems an unnecessary delay. Walters<br />\nwould prefer a single committee to handle<br />\nboth problems but says, \"there is little<br />\n(the Student Council) can do\" to secure<br />\nadoption of this method.<br />\n(Continued on page 5)<br /><br />\n\"Frankly Disappointed\"<br />\nStrider said he was \"frankly somewhat disappointed\" with the study, due<br />\nto its failure to explore adequately pricing policies, as well as operational costs<br />\nto the University. He stated that in the<br />\nimmediate future his committee would<br />\ngive highest priority \"to making current<br />\noperations as efficient as possible.\" In<br />\nline with this immediate priority, Strider said that the Committee would devote itself in the next few weeks to ensuring that students receive required<br />\ntexts at the beginning of second semester.<br />\nThe report suggested that supervisory<br />\nauthority over the Book Center be transfered from the Office of the Dean of the<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences to the Vice<br />\nPresident for Administration.In explain.,<br /><br />\ning the suggested relocation, the study<br />\nemphasized<br />\nthe<br />\nneed for greater<br />\n'business direction.'<br />\nCiting the low turnover rate in inventory as a major cause of inefficiency,<br />\nthe report also recommended that the<br />\nimmediate reduction of inventory levels.<br />\nThe study found as a particular problem<br />\nthe overstocking of books not required<br />\nin academic courses but of interest only<br />\nto certain professors and students. The<br />\nreport urged a future reduction of such<br />\nnon-academic book purchases.<br />\nThe Peat-Marwick recommendation<br />\nwhich drew the most favorable response<br />\nfrom Book Center emplo'Yees dealt with<br />\npay scales. Current salaries are below<br />\nthe national average for college bookstore employees, the report noted, and an<br />\nupward revision was suggested.<br /><br />\nFeather Bed<br />\nThe report further discussed the<br />\nnecessity of posting a security guard at<br />\nthe entrance to he Book Center,and came<br />\nto the conclusion that the job should be<br />\neliminated during all but the peak periods<br />\nat the beginning of each semester.On this<br />\nscore, Charles Vane, manager of the<br />\nCenter and a member of Strider's committee, disagreed. He was reluctant to<br />\neliminate the security guard, he said,<br />\nbecause he thought the present security<br />\narrangements acted as a deterred to<br />\ntheft.<br />\nAs to the other recommendations,however, Vane conceded that the report was<br />\nof considerable value in efforts to improve the operation of the Book Center.<br />\nIn a final area, that of physical outlay,<br />\nthe report suggested the extension of the<br />\ncounter space in order to increase clerk<br />\nsales as opposed to self service purchases.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\n_<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, Nov.<br /><br />\n, 1969<br /><br />\nSA Draft Counselling Offers Viable Alternatives<br />\nThe free draft counselling service of<br />\nLevering Hall is designed to make people<br />\naware of the alternatives open to them<br />\nunder the Selective Service Act.<br />\n\"We try to help individual young men<br />\nto make responsible decisions about their<br />\nfuture,\" said Leonard Turk a graduate<br />\nstudent and draft counsellor. He noted<br />\nthat a lot of people \"refuse to deal with<br />\ntheir own futures.\" This has become apparent in the poor attendance which is<br />\ngenerally from the 18 to 19 year age<br />\nbracket with few graduate students taking advantage of the service.<br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, chaplain of the<br />\nUniversity, was instrumental in developing the draft counseling program. For<br />\nthe last two years this service has<br />\noperated out of Levering Hall, although<br />\nit receives only nominal funding from<br />\nthe University.<br />\npeople,\" Turk continued,<br />\n\"Most<br />\n\"come to the sessions with specific problems relating to medical deferrments<br />\nand how to get classifications.\" These<br />\ntype of questions are easily cleared up<br />\nwith short answers and consequently the<br />\ncounsellors \"do not have the opportunity<br />\nto get to know that much about the ad-<br /><br />\nvisees. The counsellors, who are available for consultation from 2 p.m. to 4<br />\np.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays,would<br />\nideally like to build up files on the students \"at least as extensive as that of the<br />\nlocal draft boards.\"<br /><br />\nIrrevocable Decisions<br />\nMr. Turk noted that \"Canada is not an<br />\neasy way out and it may involve a series<br />\nof irrevocable decisions.\" The counselling offered is ostensibly \"a way to work<br />\nwithin the system. There are ways to<br />\neal with the .system short of running<br />\naway.\"<br />\nOne such alternative is the attainment<br />\nof a conscientious objector or CO classification.There are two CO classifications<br />\navailable. They are 1-0 which defers the<br />\nperson from all military service and<br />\n1-A-0 which puts the person in a military job that is noncombat and usually<br />\nin the medical corps. Because the holder<br />\nof a 1-A-0 classification goes into the<br />\narmed forces it helps to fill the quota<br />\nof the local board. This makes this<br />\nclassification easier to obtain. Turk<br />\nnoted that \"you have to start thinking<br />\nabout what they'd normally consider poli-<br /><br />\ntical or philosophical grounds in terms<br />\nof religious experience if you want to<br />\nbe protected by the law.\" Highly political<br />\nclaims for getting a CO were termed<br />\n\"arguable but not likely.\" This is because the law \"excludes political, philosophical, and moral grounds\" for a<br />\nCO. Turk said that \"if they're gonna put<br />\nyou in jail anyway you might as well<br />\napply for a CO and try to stay out.\"<br />\nThere was an attempt to involve the<br />\nblack community of Baltimore in the<br />\nprogram at a meeting between Dr.Wickwire and various leaders from the community. In attendance were the Rev.<br />\nVernon Dobson, Walter Carter, and Ted<br />\nRobinson. Dr. Wickwire was discouraged<br />\nby the meeting because it was shown that<br />\nthe black community would not be receptive to the idea. Rev. Dobson said that<br />\nmany inner-city residents still look toward the armed forces as a means of<br />\nesacpirrg the horrors of the ghetto. These<br />\nservices, while available to the ghetto<br />\ndweller, \"don't fulfill a useful purpose<br />\nto the black people.\" Another large problem that has to be hurdled is that of<br />\nwhite, middle class, university students<br />\ntrying to relate to inner-city residents.<br /><br />\nDr. Chester Wickwire, University Chaplain, was<br />\ninstrumental in creating the Levering Hall Draft<br />\nCounselling Service,<br />\nphoto by lernm<br /><br />\n\u2018<br />\nCLASSIFIED<br />\nTRAVEL<br />\nNEW YORK TO LONDON.<br />\nSummer vacation trips - round<br />\ntrip $169.

The fact that estimates<br />\nhave ranged from 170,000 to two million<br />\ndoes not necessary reflect a lack of sophisticated means for counting crowds as<br />\nmuch as it could reflect a conspiracy to<br />\nplay down the number of people who came<br />\nout to protest Nixon's War in Washington.<br />\nThe events of the last two months seem<br />\nto indicate that such a conspiracy could<br />\neasily be the product of a political force<br />\naimed at toning down the importance of<br />\nthe peace movement and creating afeeling of uncertainty about just how widespread it actually is. Since late September, Vice President Agnew has wasted few words explaining the insignificance of the movement. Labeling the<br />\nmarchers \"snobs\" and \"intellectuals\"<br />\nand constantly refering to the general<br />\nyouthfulness of the group, Agnew finally<br />\nentered the numbers game shortly before November's peace activities.<br />\nHis first move came during a speech<br />\nin which he refe red to the couple of hundred thousand of people who might show<br />\nUP in Washington to make law in the<br />\nstreets. Next, Agnew took on the tele-<br /><br />\nStudents Anxious<br />\nTo Move Quickly<br />\nOn Governance<br /><br />\nvision networks in an attempt to cast<br />\nsome doubt on their overall credibility<br />\njust days before the Mobilization began<br />\nIn his speech November 3, President<br />\nNixon spoke specifically to the \"young\"<br />\nabout their peace activities, excluding<br />\nthe many thousands of \"not so young\"<br />\nwho were seen in October demonstrating during the Moratorium. His development of the \"silent majority\" image<br />\nduring the speech was an attempt to<br />\ncreate a positive backing for his peace<br />\npolicy in terms of numbers without really<br />\ngoing into specifics.<br />\nThe media have managed to muddle<br />\nthe reader's and the viewer's mind by<br />\nconstantly changing estimates and using<br />\nthe ever present cop-out\"more than---\"<br />\ndropping in a minimal figure and leavint the rest to imagination. Washington's<br />\nChief of Police admitted that after a<br />\ncrowd passed 250,000 he was unable to<br />\nmake an accurate guess. It is now fact<br />\nthat this was the largest demonstration<br />\never, and hence there could be no one<br />\nwith previous experience to make an<br />\naccurate comparison.<br />\nSo why say anything at all? Numbers<br />\nhave always been important in politics.<br />\nAnd like it or not, the whole peace movement thing is the very essence of what is<br /><br />\nhappening, politically, in America today.<br />\nActive dissent is something that American politicans are not used to. Politicians, in modern times, have been able<br />\nto operate effectively because the populace was rather quiet and distant from<br />\nwhat was really going on. The sudden<br />\nmovement, initiated largely by the<br />\nyoung, toward a politics of involvement<br />\nhas caught many old style politicoes<br />\nwith their tactical pants down.<br />\nIn the case of the Nixon Administration, it would be very difficult to admit<br />\nthat any large segment of the nation was<br />\nactively opposed to the President's War<br />\nPolicy. Admitting that even a million<br />\npeople were motivated to the point of<br />\nmarching against their President could<br />\ninflict a serious wound to the President's<br />\nimage and greatly impare his ability to<br />\ncarry out his duties under the pretense<br />\nof having the nation solidly behind him.<br />\nClearly, within the historical context at<br />\nleast, it has been the active and vocal<br />\nminority which has most radically been<br />\nable to affect change in the political<br />\nstructure of this nation. However, at this<br />\npoint in history, that change seems contrary to what would be the best interests<br />\nof the President; and many have indicated<br /><br />\nthat his best interests are not necessarily<br />\nthe best interests of the people. This does<br />\nnot indicate malicious intent, rather political motivation.<br /><br />\nWith the precedent set by the previous<br />\nMoratorium, there was no reason to expect the November activities to be more<br />\naccurately estimated. But in November<br />\nthefocus of the demonstration was changed from education to numbers. The leaders of the movement were calling the<br />\n\"masters\" at their own game.What would<br />\nthey do with a crowd that people could see<br />\nwas large and concentrated in one area?<br />\nThe truth is that no one knows for sure.<br />\nIt was the largest demonstration ever in<br />\nhistory. It dramatically surpassed the<br />\nl0,00 people who gathered earlier in the<br />\nweek at the Washington Monument and<br />\nwere immediately proclaimed the voice<br />\nof the \"silent majority.\" How 10,000<br />\npeople in Tuesday has any more right to<br />\nlay claim to 200 million than 1,5 million<br />\npeople on Saturday is a question no one<br />\nwants to answer. Likewise, no one wants<br />\nto talk about the reported thousands who<br />\ncould not come to Washington because<br />\nof sudden and mysterious bus cancellations and various weather hazards.<br /><br />\nTHERE ARE ALL KINDS OF BREAD<br /><br />\n(Continued from page 3)<br />\nIn a telephone interview earlier this<br />\nweek, Beer said that \"the Academic<br />\nCouncil asked for this particular procedure.\" He implied that he was in no<br />\nPosition to change the process although<br />\nhe was aware that \"students wanted<br />\nthings to move as quickly as possible.\"<br />\nHe also stated that he had no idea which of<br />\nthe two alternatives the faculty would<br />\nChoose in response to his letter.<br />\nAgitation for student representation on<br />\ndecision-making bodies has a long history<br />\nat Hopkins.

The leaders of the \"New<br />\nMobe\" may be subject to prosecution<br />\nunder the provisions of the Federal Antiriot Act of 1968.,<br />\nThe only name which Kleindienst mentioned was that of David Dellinger, prominent speaker and agitator for the new<br />\nleft.

The steps in the process have<br />\nbeen the same as<br />\nif the question were one of parking permits or<br />\nfacu:ty club rules. In this<br />\ncase, however, the procedural meanderings from commit<br />\ntee to committee<br />\nshould not cloud the importance of the issue.<br />\nWhat is being considered is the creation of a committee<br />\nto determine<br />\nwhether a change in governance is needed. The<br />\nresponse to Dr. Beer's<br />\nletter to the faculty will decide on the manner in which<br />\nthis committee is<br />\nformed. Once it has been created, it will survey the<br />\nuniversity to determine the dominant attitude of the campus.<br />\nThe results of the committee's survey should show that Hopkins<br />\nis<br />\nconvinced that changes must be made.

This is the result of recommendati<br />\nons by the Academic<br />\nCouncil which directed the Faculty General Assembly to<br />\nappoint the<br />\ncommittee. The General Assembly ran out of time at its last<br />\nmeeting and<br />\ncould not deal with the question at all; this necessitated Berr's<br />\nletter.<br />\nOnce the faculty informs Beer how the \"survey\" committee should<br />\nbe<br />\nformed, that committee can be created and embark on its investigation.<br />\nAssuming that it finds change requisite, it must recommend to the Academic Council that another committee be formed. The second commit<br />\ntee<br />\nwill look into the question of what changes should be made. Assumi<br />\nng<br />\nthat it determines that certain changes are necessary, it recommends back<br />\nto the Academic Council to that effect. After that, the<br />\nprocess becomes<br />\ntoo complex to relate\u2014the system is even less fit for doing someth<br />\ning than<br />\nit is for investigating.<br />\nIn short, the intricacies of decision making at Hopkins under the present system are so convoluted that it is difficult to speak<br />\nof them, much<br />\nless- use them effectively. It is not difficult to understand why<br />\nHopkins<br />\nseems to stand still when the Council has to recommend to the<br />\nAssembly<br /><br />\n130UvcRY<br />\npozcm OR so<br /><br />\nPresident Nixon and his administration are trying to make the<br />\nrecent<br />\ndemonstrations in Washington seem as small, violent and destruc<br />\ntive as<br />\npossible. Witness the recent statement of Herbert G. Klein, Nixon's<br />\ndirector of communications: \"Had it not been for the highly effective work<br />\nof<br />\nthe Washington police, of the National Guard . . . for the reserve forces<br />\nof<br />\nthe Defense Department and the complete cooperation of all elements of<br />\nthe government . . . and the work of the Justice Depart<br />\nment . . .<br />\ndamage to Washington (last weekend) would have been far greater the<br />\nthan<br />\n. . . the riots after the death of Martin Luther King.\"<br />\nAnyone who was in Washington last weekend (including the press)<br />\nwill testify to the prevailing atmosphere of unity, harmony and peacefu<br />\nlness which prevailed. The statement above and others which emanated<br />\nfrom government offices are obviously misleading.<br />\nThe primary reason for trying to convey a distorted picture of the<br />\ndemonstration activities is that Nixon knows his silent majority<br />\nis not<br />\nsolid. By making demonstrations seem smaller and more violent,<br />\nhe<br />\naccomplishes two aims. First, he conveys to his silent majority the impression that the dissenters are only a small minority. Nixon knows<br />\nthat<br />\nthose who support him need to feel they are in the mainstream\u2014that they<br />\nare on the bandwagon.<br />\nSecond and more important. Nixon wants to keep the nation scared.<br />\nThe more violent he can make a demonstration appear, the more the<br />\nideas<br />\nexpressed by the demonstrators are rejected out of simple fear.<br />\nAnd at<br />\nthis point, the President knows that fear is his most powerful<br />\nally.<br />\nThe culmination of the Nixon \"scare\u2014 campaign can be seen in<br />\nthe<br />\nJustice Department's pla n ned investiga tion of elements of the Morato<br />\nrium<br />\nand Mobilization committee to determine whether there was conspi<br />\na<br />\nracy<br />\n\"to commit violence.\"<br />\nThe larger issue, which overshadows specific Nixon pronouncemen<br />\nts<br />\non the moratorium, is the question of repression. If Nixon<br />\nsucceeds in<br />\nisolating anti-war activists by polarizing the \"silent majority\"<br />\nwith scare<br />\ntactics and other propaganda, repression of dissidents will be<br />\nan easier<br />\ntask.<br />\nIn viewing Administration reaction to the Moratorium, Agnew'<br />\ns badmouthing about the media and Attorney-General Mitchell's handli<br />\nng of<br />\n\"justice,\" we have little doubt that a campaign of repression, masked<br />\nin<br />\nprettier and legalistic terms, is in the works.<br />\nThe Nixon television technicians did a good job during last year's<br />\nelection campaign in erasing Nixon's hatchet-man, arch-conservative image,<br />\nbut now we know the \"old Nixon\" is back to stay.<br /><br />\n()IR I POZE MW<br />\nWEAVE-0-0ST It\\J<br />\nCASE.<br /><br />\nSlePs<br />\nPUCK- JUST<br />\nIN CASE.<br /><br />\nOR I DROP<br />\nTO TH66MNPTOST D3 CASe.<br /><br />\nMisrepresentation<br /><br />\nOR r oto\nt<br />\nt_1<br />\n6E1- OFF A<br />\nCcOfle OF WARK IMG SHOTS 3O5T IN CASE.<br /><br />\nUTTER TO BE SAFE<br /><br />\nTH-Ak)<br /><br />\nY.<br /><br />\nPublishers-Hall Syr:.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nte<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, Nov. 211 1969<br /><br />\niNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE_ 10<br /><br />\nfeatures<br /><br />\nRecords<br /><br />\nFrankie and Johnnie: New Sound<br />\nFrankie<br />\nHot Rats - Frank Zappa (Bizzare 6356)<br />\nIn this day of the disintegration of pop groups, there is<br />\nan atmosphere of both hope and despair. \"The Buffalo<br />\nSpringfield\" left hope with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.<br />\n\"Cream\" left despair, in the forms of \"Blind Faith\" and<br />\nJack Bruce. Word filters down that the \"Mothers of Invention\" have now broken up. But in their departure from the<br />\npop scene, they have left a hope in the form of Hot Rats.<br />\nTo say that Hot Rats sounds like the Mothers is a truth,<br />\nbut to say that it's by the Mothers is a falsehood. The only<br />\n\"Mothers\" on the record are Frank Zappa and Ian Underwood, the straight member of the group. The rest are either<br />\nstudio musicians from Straight and Bizzare Records or are<br />\njust friends of Zappa. This record just proves what the<br />\ndevout fans always knew: Zappa was the Mothers.His personality dominates Hot Rats as much as it did the Mothers.<br />\nExamples of this domination are plentiful throughout<br />\nthe album. Saxophone solos by Underwood and violin solos<br />\nby Sugar Cane Harris sound as if Zappa had played them<br />\nhimself. All harmonies are those typical of Zappa. All<br />\nguitar, including some very well done solos, is played by<br />\nZappa. To like this album is to like Frank Zappa.<br /><br />\nDouble Saxed<br />\nThere are high points to this album other than Zappa.<br />\nBeing the only saxophone player, Underwood has, and uses,<br />\nample opportunity to show that he is a very good doubletrack artist. He's always in time with himself and the harmonies could not have been more in tune if he had four other<br />\npeople playiiig along with him. His solos are far better than<br />\nthe ones in Uncle Meat (Bizzare 2024). Ian's piano, organ,<br />\netc. show that he is a well rounded musician.<br />\nThe addition of violinists Harris and Jean Luc Ponty is a<br />\ngreat innovation. They are each good on the instrument and<br />\nfit well into the Zappa scheme of music. Also drummers<br />\nJohn Guerin, Ron Selico and Paul Humphery do their bit to<br />\nmake the album great.<br />\n\"Peaches En Regalia\" is possibly the finest and tightest<br />\nsong on the record. This song shows Zappa's talents as<br />\nwriter and producer. A nice melody played by Underwood's<br />\nsaxes, this is where Ian shows his stuff on double -tracking.<br /><br />\nSexual Prevert<br />\n\"Willie the Pimp\" has the only vocal on the album. The<br />\nvocalist is Captain Beefheart, an unknown quantity from<br />\nStraight Records. I leave it to the listener to decide about<br /><br />\nhis vocal since it is one of the most unusual voices ever recorded. The best part of this cut is Zappa's six minute guitar<br />\nsolo which is intense, never relaxing and, most of all, never<br />\nboring.<br />\n\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\" is an instrumental version<br />\nof Uncle Meats' \"Mr. Green Genes.\" Again there is good<br />\norgan and sax work by Underwood and an excellent guitar<br />\ninterpretation of the melody by Zappa.<br />\n\"Little Umbrellas\" is a jazz-like piece with good drumming by Guerin and fine bass by Max Bennett. Underwood<br />\nspreads himself over saxes, piano, organ and flute and does<br />\nwell on all of them. This is just a nice, short, easy-tolisten-song.<br />\n\"The Gumbo Variations\" has the finest moments of Underwood and Harris. Zappa starts with a definitive melody<br />\non the guitar and Underwood then puts it through all of his<br />\nramifications. About half-way through, and almost imperceptibly, Harris takes over with his violin and explains it<br />\nall his way. humphery and Bennett combine to give an incedibly clean drum and bass back-up. This is an excellent<br />\ncut and does not get boring even though it lasts almost thirteen minutes.<br />\n\"It Must Be a Camel\" is a slow piece emphasizing the<br />\ndrums of Guerin and the bass of Bennett. Underwood again<br />\ndoes well on saxophones and piano while Zappa plays accompanying guitar to round out the sound. This is, indeed, a<br />\nnice piece with which to end the record.<br />\nOne final note: the cover was designed by Zappa and,<br />\nalmost necessarily, leaves the cover fetishist with this<br />\nfinal message: \"Shame on you. You didn't trust Mothers.\"<br /><br />\nciples), Mayall has picked up guitar(electric, but plugged into his P.A. system. Marshalls are out.) He still plays harmonica and sings, also does tambourine and \"mouth percussion\". He picked up acoustic guitar player John Mark from<br />\nMarianne Faithfull and kept Steve Thompson, his old bassist.<br />\nJohnny Almond rounds it out with tenor, alto, and various<br />\nflutes.<br /><br />\nSubtlety and Finesse<br />\nSo what Mayall has done is to trade volume and beat for<br />\nsubtlety and .finesse. The singing is neither here nor there it's just Mayall's increasingly individualistic style. Thompson has gotten a bit more imaginative, but his bass remains<br />\nbasically unchanged--he supplies pulse where it is required,<br />\nand otherwise keeps a low, if thoroughly competent, profile.<br />\nAnd that is where mere competence ends.The rest of it is<br />\nnothing short of brilliant, not to say innovative.If you think<br />\nMayall can play piano and organ, you should hear him on<br />\nguitar. The same goes double for Jon Mark. But, to my mind,<br />\nthe best of all is Almond's sax and flute playing. He has the<br />\nrange and sophistication of many \"name\" jazz people, but<br />\nhe has chosen not to abandon a recognizable framework.<br />\nTwice, he elicits spontaneous applause.(The album is live<br />\nat the Fillmore East)<br /><br />\nJazz Orientation<br /><br />\nThe music is, as usual, mostly written by Mayall.(Thompson collaborated on two of the seven cuts) in \"The Laws<br />\nMust Change,\" he makes \"a few personal observations of<br />\npolice vs. youth and the drug situation\". When he invokes the<br />\nLenny Bruce, the audience applauds. Groovy<br />\nGeorge Barneston memory of<br />\naudience. In \"California,\" the longest cut (9:14), he sings<br />\nof homesickness, against the probing backdrop of Almond's<br />\ntenor, which first echoes the vocal, then explores the problem alone.

Parker continued his self-imposed hibernation until the last week of<br />\nthe 1904 campaign. By then desperate<br />\nmeasures were clearly called for.<br />\nOf course there were wildly optimistic<br />\npress releases from various Democratic<br />\ncommittees, but to objective observers<br />\nIt was clear that the Parker campaign<br />\nwas moribund. Decisive areas were<br />\nfalling to President Roosevelt. New<br />\nYork, the decisive state in all three<br />\nCleveland campaigns, was always considered essential to Parker's hopes. At<br />\nthe start of the campign New _York was<br />\nconsidered a doubtful state. President<br />\nRoosevelt, a political perfectionist who<br />\nwas far more apprehensive than he had<br />\nto be about this campaign, had tried to<br />\nbolster the Republican cause in the state<br />\nby drafting Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler<br />\nto run for Governor. Unfortunately there<br />\nwere New York Democrats who desired<br />\nto see their candidate, and Parker's lack<br />\nof vigor in the campaign counted against<br />\nhim. At the<br />\nclose of<br />\ncamthe<br />\npaign, publications<br />\nwere generally<br />\nassigning New York to Roosevelt.<br />\nThis information virtually doomed the<br />\nParker campaign and there was nothing<br />\nto compensate for it. William J. Bryan's lukewarm support was clearly not<br />\nenough to influence the Western states<br />\nfor Parker. In the Midwest, the candidate was virtually unknown. Parker's<br />\nrunning mate was from the small state<br />\nof West Virginia. He could do no more<br />\nthan carry his home state, and conceivably he would not do that much.<br />\nBy the waning days, it was clear that<br />\nParker's policy of near-total silence had<br />\nbeen found wanting and he might find it<br />\nexpedient to issue a charge concerning<br />\nPresident Roosevelt. He had a vast area<br />\nof discretion concerning what sort of<br />\ncharge to issue. If one allows that Parker<br />\nwas the candidate of the conservative<br />\nDemocrats, charged with representing<br />\nhimself as \"safe and sane\" in contrast<br />\nto President Roosevelt, one might expect<br />\na press release to the effect that Roosevelt was a dangerous radical bent on<br />\nundermining the most venerable American institutions. The fact that Parker<br />\nmoved in the opposite direction, implicity<br />\ndescribing the President as a lackey of<br />\nWall Street, is rich in revelation concerning the initial hopelessness of the<br />\nParker campaign. The tenor of Parker's<br />\nstatement indicates a decision made by<br />\nhis headquarters to the effect that Parker<br />\nshould suddenly sound the toscin of Bryan and LaFollette against the evils of the<br />\ntrusts. It is quite conceivable that this<br />\nwas a more popular position than the<br />\nstrange call for safety and sanity, but in<br />\nParker the call for reform was out of<br />\ncharacter. Parker's gold standard telegram was a master stroke, not only because it showed the candidate in a position of command, but because it placed<br />\nhim in a conservative position entirely<br />\nin accordance with his image. Parker<br />\ncould only seem silly and inconsistent<br />\nas suddenly, in the last week of an uphill campaign, he professed to awake to<br />\nthe dangers of the trusts and their alleged collusion with President Roosevelt.<br />\nThis much said, the facts of Parker's<br />\nlast desperate stroke are relatively<br />\ndreary. The Justice elaborated on a<br />\nsuspicion which had covertly permeated<br />\ncertain Democratic journals,concerning<br />\nthe effect that the Republican National<br />\nChairman, George Cortelyou, had formerly been Secretary of Commerce and<br />\nLabor. Parker considered it unethical<br />\nthat the man formerly charged with overseeing trusts was now using his knowledge of business in the attempt to raise<br />\nmoney. He did not cite any specific<br />\ncases in which Cortelyou had exacted<br />\ntribute in return for a promise not to<br /><br />\nprosecute any particular trust. He was<br />\nconcerned that, as he charged,the trusts<br />\nwere bankrolling the Republican campaign. The tenor of the Parker statement is that anything that could not be<br />\ndemonstrated, could be suspected.<br />\nRoosevelt, who had been spending the<br />\ncampaign in uncharacteristic silence,<br />\noverruled certain of his advisers and<br />\nreplied. He said that \"the silence of<br />\nself-respect\" had sealed his lips thus<br />\nfar. The President wrote with his characteristic vigor, a firming the splendid<br />\nmoral character of Cortelyou and Parker's evident failure to substantiate himself. He declared that he was controlled by no one except the people, to whom<br />\nhe sought to give \"a square deal, no<br />\nmore and no less.\" The fascinating exchange had thus far consisted of Parker's<br />\nunsubstantiated charges, followed by<br />\nRoosevelt's ringing affirmation that the<br /><br />\ncharges were unsubstantiated.<br />\nThe President, a consummate policician, was never shrewder than in this<br />\nreply. He issued it on the Friday evening before the elction, for release in<br />\nSaturday morning newspapers. Had he<br />\nmulled over the statement for another<br />\nday or two, the Democrats could have<br />\ncharged that the late issuance of the<br />\nPresident's rebuttal gave Parker no time<br />\nto respond. As matters stood, Parker<br />\nwould be expected to forumlate some<br />\nresponse. A renewed failure to substantiate his charges would amount to suicide.<br />\nThere was in fact material which, if<br />\nexposed, might have caused a minor sensation, such as the correspondence between the President and Edward Harriman which later agritated Senator LaFollette. Parker lacked knowledge of<br />\nthis, and his statement of sur- rebuttal<br /><br />\nwas poor. He declared, with ringing<br />\naccuracy, that Mr. Cortelyou had formerly been Secretary of Commerce and<br />\nLabor and was now National Chairman.<br />\n\"Now, these facts are not challenged by<br />\nthe President, nor can they be.\" Without offering much other solid fact, he<br />\ndazzlingly charged contributions \"by the<br />\ngreat monopolists for the continuance<br />\nof old favors.\" This charge is not inconceivable on its face, but Parker<br />\nshould have cited some great monopolists, some contributions and some old<br />\nfavors, if, in fact, he knew about them.<br />\nParker closed by indicating that President Roosevelt's defeat would constitute<br />\na stinging \"rebuke\" to the trusts.<br />\nThus sorrowfully closed the last gamble of Justice Parker. To use a favorite<br />\nphrase of President Roosevelt, his \"bolt<br />\nwas shot.\" Next week I shall discuss the<br />\ntense, exciting Election Night.<br />\nkil Wei/de/so/in<br /><br />\nSMALL AND<br />\nSENSITIVE<br />\nDOESN 'T HAVE TO<br />\nMEAN<br />\nTEMPERMENTAL<br /><br />\nKLH 18 - $129<br />\nPut these two together<br />\nand you have an<br /><br />\nKLH 22 - $55<br /><br />\nextraordinarily sensitive tuner system<br />\nCUSTOM MUSIC .SYSTEMS<br /><br />\nSTEREO<br /><br />\nSTEREO<br /><br />\nHIGH FIDELITY<br />\n106 W.

Duncan's shutter<br />\ncatches Florida's governor Claude Kirk<br />\npracticing the V-for-Victory sign at the<br />\npodium before an empty convention hall-just in case he won the Republican<br />\nnomination for Vice-President, the conventioneers listening almost disinterestedly while Everett Dirksen recites the<br />\nplatform of the Republican Party for 1968,<br />\nand Richard Nixon rewriting his acceptance speech right before the photographer's lens.<br />\nThis is all very modest, very mild.<br />\nThere is even a sweet glimpse of \"young<br />\nlove\" with Julie Nixon (then engaged)<br />\nsitting prettily on the lapof David Eisenhower.<br />\nThen there is Chicago. Strewn everywhere with \"Welcome\" signs from<br />\nMayor Richard Daley, Chicago was, as<br />\nDuncan puts it, \"Something Else!\" Indeed it was. The photographs from the<br /><br />\nDemocratic Convention are startlingly<br />\ndifferent from those taken at the Republican Convention. It is like juxtaposing a Duerer woodcut and a pastel picture of Camelot. Humanity sweats and<br />\nstrains under eyes without sleep in front<br />\nof Duncan's Democratic camera. Faces<br />\nand hands tense and clench. The candidates are short with their words, tired<br />\nwith their eyes, and nervous with their<br />\nhands. The whole attitude is one of expectation for something unknown.<br />\n\"As the Senator(McGovern)spoke,old<br />\npro Pierre Salinger never flinched an<br />\neye.

His pictures, too, are emotionally involved. Simplistically, there<br />\nis not a helluva lot to say about David<br />\nDouglas Duncan's book (although I suppose I have taken a good while to come<br />\naround to saying just that). You feel it.<br />\nFrom the deepest part of your gut you<br />\nturn and twist your emotions inside out<br />\nand then hang them up to dry.<br />\nThe march at Grant Park in downtown<br />\nChicago with candles and papercups and<br />\nprotest songs from another era becomes<br />\nthat sight of the future which before had<br />\nseen so lacking inDuncan's camera perspective.

I did not use that term during<br />\nthe office conversation on November 6 or<br />\nat any other time, it would not occur to<br />\nme so to characterize any assistant professor recruited by one of our departments, least of all a department with<br />\nWhich I am personally associated. When<br />\nyour reporter interviewed me on November 11, I stated that I had not used<br />\nthe word \"idiot,\" and I was astonished<br />\nto see it appear twice in quotation marks<br />\nin your November 14 issue.<br /><br />\nI did use the term \"peanut\" in responding to the argument that the invitation to<br />\nDr. Chomsky was logically identical to<br />\nan invitation to Dr. Pfeffer--that they<br />\nwere, so to speak, like interchangeable<br />\nparts of a machine. I replied that Dr.<br />\nChomsky is a well known personage of<br />\nnational stature, in comparison with<br />\nwhom Dr. Pfeffer is \"a peanut.\" I regret the use of the particular word,which<br />\nI would not have chosen in a statement<br />\nintended for publication, but neither the<br />\nthought nor its expression in the context<br />\nsummarized above justify your adjective<br />\n\"slanderous.\"<br />\nApart from this outright misquotation,<br />\nyour editorial charges me with bad faith<br />\nand duplicity in a way unwarranted by<br />\nanything in the whole episode. My original motive in suggesting the panel discussion was a feeling that people were<br />\nwearying of speeches simply saying that<br />\nthe war was a bad thing, since that is<br />\nalmost universally agreed, and the real<br />\nissue which deserved serious discussion<br />\nwas how to get out of the war.I proposed<br />\nthat faculty members reflecting a wide<br />\nrange of opinions be found to lead such a<br />\ndiscussion. The issue, incidentally, is<br />\nnot one with only two sides, as you seem<br />\nto believe.<br />\nI proposed no individuals by name,except-- in response to Manoel Rodriguez'<br /><br />\nComplete Bachelor<br />\nService<br /><br />\nurging--to suggest Governor Harriman<br />\nas the one prominent and knowledgeable<br /><br />\nly interesting exchange of views, even<br />\nthough much of it strayed far from the<br />\noriginal theme. My only regret is that the<br />\nepisode should be clouded by the misquotation and the absurd allegations of<br />\nulterior motives printed in your journal.<br /><br />\nperson I thought I might persuade to come<br />\non such short notice. What made me angry<br />\nabout the invitation to Dr. Chomsky was<br />\nthe apparent change, without prior consultation, in the arrangements I had<br />\nunderstood to be fully agreed with the<br />\nstudent leaders and which! had described<br />\nto Governor Harriman when inviting him.<br />\nI had no idea in advance of the session<br />\nwhat Dr. Dinerstein's position on the<br />\nissues would turn out to be. Dr. Pfeffer's<br />\nname was suggested by Messrs. Archibald and Rodriguez, and Dr. Dinerstein's<br />\nby Dr. Bevan. Nor did I originally intend<br />\nto participate myself, agreeing to do so<br />\nonly at the request of the student leaders.<br />\nIt is beyond rational understanding how<br />\nyou can construe these events as an<br />\n\"abortive ruse\" to use Dr.Pfeffer as\"a<br />\nfoil\" for Governor Harriman.<br /><br />\nSincerely Yours,<br />\nLincoln Gordon,<br />\n,President<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe following letter was sent to President Gordon yesterday:<br />\n\"We regret that your letter, published in the November 14 issue of the NewsLetter, has failed to affirm your respect<br />\nfor the intellectual capacity of a fellow<br />\nmember in the Hopkins community.<br />\nThe type of remarks attributed to you<br />\nwill not contribute to the possibility of<br />\na mutual confidence which the com munity<br />\nso badly needs.<br />\nBy allowing your purported disparagement of professor Pfeffer to stand, you<br />\nhave cast doubt upon the ability of your<br />\nfellow department members to evaluate<br />\ntheir peers.

In the first paragraph he states,<br />\n\"...the presence of ROTC directly hinders the training of scholars.\" How can<br />\none make such a generalized and senseless statement? Later he goes on to say,<br />\n\"but throughout its publicly recorded<br />\nhistory ROTC has been tremendously<br />\nwasteful of student effort.\" Obviously<br />\nProfessor Hartman has never spoken to<br />\nan ROTC graduate. If he would make the<br />\neffort to get some \"first-hand informa-<br /><br />\n**<br /><br />\nCorrespondence<br />\ntion,\" I'm sure he would realize the importance and the value of ROTC training<br />\nto an officer of the Armed Forces.(Upon<br />\nrequest, I'll gladly send the addresses<br />\nof a few ROTC-graduate officers presently serving on active duty). Professor<br />\nHartman also believes that \"after 2 to 4<br />\nyears of active duty,\" an ex-Army officer<br />\ncould not \"compete with students uncom mitted to active military service.\" Contrary to his opinion, it iswell-known that<br />\nex-officers of the Armed Forces are<br />\nsought after by American business and<br />\nindustry not only for their experience and<br />\nability, but for their leadership qualities<br />\nas well. Therefore, service in the Armed<br />\nForces as an officer is more of an advantage than a hindrance.<br /><br />\nLARRY'S MAGIC PRODUCTIONS LTD.<br /><br />\nPRESENTS IN BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nJANIS<br /><br />\nJOPLIN<br />\nJOE COCKER AND THE GREASE BAND<br /><br />\nobligations between the University ani<br />\nthe Army; it is the Army, and not the<br />\nUniversity, that must produce the required amount of ROTC enrollees.

I would also like to remind<br />\nProfessor Hartman that the Army does<br />\nnot solicit, recruit or cajole students to<br />\njoin ROTC;in fact, the SDS has afar<br />\nmore extensive membership campaign.<br />\nConcerning financial matters and<br />\nROTC, Professor Hartman quotes the<br />\ncomparatively high number of Army<br />\nscholarship students at Hopkins and<br />\nquestions if they are \"selectively admitt-<br /><br />\nI will pay<br />\nhandsomely<br />\nfor 2 tickets<br />\nto the Rolling<br />\nStones' Concert<br />\n--call Dick<br />\n329-6305<br /><br />\ned.\" As a scholarship recipient, I can<br />\nassure Professor Hartman that the Army<br />\nhas no influence on college acceptances<br />\n(during Orientation Week in September<br />\nI found that both the Registrar's Office<br />\nand the Office of Financial Aid had no<br />\nrecord of my award). Also, since ROTC<br />\nscholarship candidates are competively<br />\nchosen, it is evident that an academically outstanding school like Hopkins will<br />\nhave a greater percentage of scholarship<br />\nstudents. Professor Hartmanwould like<br />\nto see ROTC abolished at Hopkins, which<br />\nwould force the scholaFship students to<br />\nattend schools other than Hopkins. \"Enrollment of these students elsewhere<br />\nwould be to Hopkins great benefit.\" How<br />\nis this so, Professor Hartman? Not even<br />\none advantage has been stated for the<br />\nabolishment of ROTC on campus.<br />\nTherefore I ask: can anyone state at<br />\nleast one positive advantage for the<br />\nabolishment of ROTC??<br /><br />\nIf You're 18...or over<br />\nn\u2022 = r.;<br />\n\"<br />\n1 Q.<br /><br />\nc&lt; 3 m'<br /><br />\n0 0z 2<br /><br />\nBITTIIIIMD BLUES BIND<br />\nAND SPECIAL GUEST ATTRACTION<br /><br />\n\"I do not feel that the University should<br />\nhave a contractural obligationto produce<br />\n'a minimum of twenty-five officers per<br />\nyear.\" Professor Hartman has completely reversed the true contractural<br /><br />\nc_ c<br /><br />\na 0_ c)<br />\n..... \u2014<br /><br />\nFrom the country<br />\nthat gave you,<br />\n\"I A WOMAN,\"<br />\n\"INGA\" and<br />\n\"I AM CURIOUS<br /><br />\nCharles &amp; 34th St<br />\n\u2022 1 4111 411-1 41 i Il 1I 41<br /><br />\nJAll<br />\nI<br />\nWORKSHOP<br /><br />\nm 5 ...

Mr. Amsler<br />\ngot through the first paragraph without<br />\na mistake, but his errors begin with the<br />\nstatement that this is Barthelme's second<br />\nbook. It is, in fact, his third, the first<br />\nbeing a collection of stories,Come Back,<br />\nDoctor Caligari, which no doubt Mr.<br />\nAmsler in his search for the superficially<br />\nprofound will find tedious and a suitable<br />\ntarget begging for a put-down, even<br />\nthough it is much older than its relatively<br />\nYounger brother. One question is raised:<br />\nwhy review at this time a book that was<br />\npublished almost two years ago in this<br />\nseason when one has such an enticing<br />\ntarget as The Love Machine?<br />\nMr. Amsler is, of course, welcome<br />\nto his opinion, but I feel that Barthelme<br />\nwrites beautifully in a spare and innovative style that details absurd incidents of<br />\nmodern life, yet produces the menace,<br />\nennui, hysteria and hilarity by implication. The neglect to mention the number<br />\nof short stories concerned with war and<br />\npeople's reactions to war is a major<br />\noversight since Barthelme discusses the<br /><br />\nsame. Sorry, but that's the way it is.<br />\nNonetheless, I would like to concur<br />\nwith Mr. Krieger in something he pointed out in his letter and which I evidently failed to make clear in my review. By<br />\nall means,anyone interested in the structure and development of the contemporary short store and novelette should<br />\ndefinitely read Donald Barthelme.<br /><br />\nVietnam conflict with scathing wit and<br />\nand insight in a day (1967) when it was<br />\nstill not terribly fashionable to be antiwar, much less a writer of fiction indicating the nature of the war. Barthelme,<br />\nhowever, did not resort to the cliches that<br />\none finds so often in the work of those<br />\nwho have decided that committment in<br />\nthat area is demanded of the modern<br />\nauthor.<br />\nMr. Amsler confuses the surface<br />\nfrivolity in the work with the underlying<br />\nintent and meaning. One wonders how he<br />\nwould react to the poem of e.e.cum mings.<br />\nJoh n lleParland<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\n\u201e<br />\nI would like to acknowledge Elliott<br />\nKrieger's letter to the News-Letter<br />\n(November 14). He is indeed quite right,<br />\nand my research not extensive enough,<br />\nto discover that Unspeakable Practices,<br />\nUnnatural Acts is Donald Barthelme's<br />\nthird, not second book. I stand corrected.<br />\nHowever, I have just one thing to say<br />\nconcerning Mr. Krieger's accusation/<br />\nsuggestion that I \"might read beyond the<br />\ncover pages of Snow ll'hite.\"I had read<br />\nSnow White before I even commenced a<br />\nreview of Barthelme's latest book and<br />\nmy opinion of Snow White remains the<br /><br />\ngrasping these works,a new way of meeting them on some sort of mutual fertile<br />\nground and grabbing a huge handful of<br />\ntheir good rich soil.<br />\nI appreciate Mr. Krieger's interest<br />\nand concern. Would that others took the<br />\ntime to be so. I hope that we might be<br />\nable to continue some sort of dialogue<br />\nvia the News-Letter concerning the<br />\nissues raised by Mr. Krieger and Mr.<br />\nFielder concerning the need for a \"new<br />\nnew criticism.''<br /><br />\nAs a last item, there is an interesting<br />\narticle in this month's Mayboy(Decernber, 1969) by Leslie Fielder entitled<br />\nCross the Border, Close the Gap. A well<br />\nknown literary critic, Mr. Fielder discusses in his eassay the need for what<br />\nhe calls a \"newnew criticism.\" He points<br />\nout that much of our contemporary fiction-particularly Norman Mailer and<br />\nAllen Ginsberg (and for that matter,<br />\nDonald Barthelme) - needs to be viewed<br />\nand interpreted on a plane differentfrom<br />\nthe generated by the works of such<br />\nwriters as Joyce, Mann, Proust, Eliot,<br />\nand Pound. These latter figures wrote<br />\nwith a style and manner which invited<br />\nacademic scholasticism and genteel dialectic. But as we approach the 1970's, the<br />\nworld of literary fiction is beset by the<br />\nunlabeled power of Mailer, the violent<br />\nlyricism of Ginsberg, and the art/antiart of such people as Barthelme and<br />\nKerouac. We urgently need a new way of<br /><br />\nMark imsler<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI call your attention to the rubber<br />\nstamping on the evenlope which states<br />\nsimply STOP THE WAR NOW.<br />\nI am using this on all checks, invoices<br />\nand the envelopes of all correspondence<br />\nthat leaves my house--both business and<br />\npersonal. My hope is to constantly remind<br />\nthat not all objections to the war in Viet<br />\nNam are coming from young people.<br />\nThis sentiment has been beautifully expressed by Gerald W. Johnson and, expensively, in the courageous letter to<br />\nCardinal Sheehan by Joseph Mack.<br />\nI ask all who sare these peaceful sentiments to make use of this simple and<br />\ninexpensive method.<br /><br />\nMyra 1)u nn .1an s<br /><br />\nVisiting Baltimore?

The NewsLetter or one was responsible for the regrettable Franklin and Marshall article. Walter Herman, former voluntary sports publicity director and alleged associate of Sydnor's wrote a less than complimentary article for the News\u2014American after the Carnegie-Mellon<br />\nloss. Coupled with this regretful negative journalism has been constant<br />\nstudent cynicism and belittlement of the Blue Jay Varsity gridders.<br />\nUndoubtedly, those who sneer the most at accomplishment or its<br />\nlack on the athletic field are also the ones who do most to hurt the<br />\nUniversity's attempts to improve the athletic teams.<br /><br />\nIncident in Press Box<br />\nAn example of this is one student who was making derogatory remarks in the pressbox during the Swarthmore football game. Unbeknowst to this student-critic, Coach Jim Valvano was also there with<br />\na basketball prospect. Here, on the one hand, we have a coach trying<br />\nto sell a student on Hopkins, and on the other a student cutting down<br />\nthe University and its sports teams. Competition for good studentathletes is hard enough without this derogatory attitude.<br />\nDerision of Hopkins is not limited to the sports scene. It is but one<br />\nsegment of a larger, more widespread \"negativism.\" This leads into<br />\nthe second part of my editorial. In fact, I find nothing more irritating<br />\nthan a group of self-appointed critics\u2014students, faculty, administrators, coaches or anyone else for that matter--sitting around on<br />\nFriday afternoon nit-picking at the failings of the News-Letter.<br />\nSuch aimless non-constructive criticism is a waste of enery. Valid<br />\ncriticism, such as of the News-Letter's F &amp; M article, which was an<br />\nunfortunate mistake and for which I, as Sports Editor, owe both the<br />\nteam and Coach Sotir an apology, is welcome.<br /><br />\nLoudmouth Critics<br />\nYet the loudmouth student-critics of the News-Letter, Hopkins in<br />\ngeneral, the Hopkins' athletics in particular could better serve themselves and the Hopkins community if they would contribute responsibly<br />\nto the News-Letter and try to correct what they think are \"faults\" in<br />\nit.<br />\nI am not saying criticism itself is bad, but it is valuable only if constructive. Anyone can tear down; building is the difficult part. If you<br />\ndon't think so, ask Coach Sotir who four years ago practically had to<br />\nstart from scratch to build a winning team.<br />\nThe News-Letter is a student newspaper,we aim to offer a responsible avenue of communication and information to the Hopkins community. Where we feel there is a wrong such as the University's admissions policy to athletic events, it is our editorial obligation and<br />\nduty to expose it. The Sports pages are in intregral part of these aims.<br />\nIn late January, the News-Letter plans to go twice-weekly which<br />\nmeans we'll need more sportswriters and reporters to give the University responsible coverage it deserves.<br />\nI ask you to join the News-Letter team.

The Jays won 28-14 in<br />\na contest that was more one-sided than the score<br />\nindicates.<br />\nPrior to the game against Hopkins, Dickinson<br />\nranked 13 in the nation in college football defense.<br />\nThey had allowed an average of only 177 yards<br />\ngained against them while posting a 4-3 record.<br />\nThe Jays came alive, after two shutout defeats, in the third quarter of the Swarthmore<br />\ngame on Nov. 8. The opening series of downs<br />\nagainst Dickinson looked like Swarthmore's fateful third quarter re-lived. Charlie Coker returned the opening kickoff 25 yards to Hopkins 35.<br />\nOn first down Bob Pfeifer hit Bill Donovan for<br />\n32 yards, and fired to Steve Latson for nine<br />\nmore. Steve Hata hit the right side of the line<br />\nfor three tough yards and Dan Augustine bulled<br />\nthe ball across the goal line five plays later.<br /><br />\nDefense Holds<br />\nHopkins defense held Dickinson on downs and<br />\nCoker took the punt on Hopkins 31. Augustine<br />\nwent over left tackle for ten yards and on the<br />\nfollowing play, sophomore running back Joe Ciesloi,vski took the second handoff on a double reverse and raced with it to the Dickinson endzone. The TD was called back and 15 yards were<br />\nassessed for a holding penalty against Hopkins.<br />\nThe Jays gave the ball up on downs and with third<br />\nand two yards to go on Hopkins 40 yard line, Dickinson's speedy halfback John West spurted past<br />\nthe Hopkins secondary for Dickinson's first score.<br />\nThe rest of the first quarter was spent inside<br />\nthe Hopkins 20 yard line. Before the half, Dickinson had seven opportunities to score from good<br />\nfield position. A great pass rush produced by<br />\nDoug Hain, Paul Weiss and Mark Curtis together<br />\nwith the blanket coverage by the proud, Szabocoached secondary stopped the Dickinson advance<br />\ncold. The score at the half was Hopkins eight,<br />\nDickinson seven.<br /><br />\nJays Owned Half<br />\nThe second half belonged to Hopkins. Again the<br />\ndefense stopped seven drives while the offense<br />\ncame alive with solid blocking and smart running.<br />\nHopkins scored on their second series of downs<br /><br />\nIn the second half.<br />\nSteve Utz led the charge with a 65 yard jaunt<br />\naround right end. Workhorse Augustine punched<br />\nfor 12 more yards and Hata pushed it across.<br />\nA game Dickinson team tied the score on the<br />\nnext series but the tie was short lived.<br />\nCoker returned the kickoff 40 yards to the Dickinson 47. Augustine bolted left end, cracked the<br />\nmiddle, cracked the middle, cracked the middle,<br />\ncracked the middle.... and Hopkins was ahead to<br />\nstay.<br /><br />\nJays Made Ball Move<br />\nThe Jays kept the ball on the ground for the<br />\nrest of the game and made it move. The Hopkins<br />\noffense scored again to open the fourth quarter.<br />\nSecond down and ten on the Hopkins 30, Steve<br />\nUtz broke around left end for 25 yards on the<br />\nstrength of a block thrown by Steve Hata. Hata<br />\nhit the middle for five yards and Utz went over<br />\nleft tackle for forty yards and the touchdown.<br />\nDickinson attempted a late quarter passing<br />\nattack that drove the ball to the Hopkins 38.<br />\nCenter linebacker Jim McMenamin intercepted a<br />\npass on the Blue Jays own 22 yard line and raced<br />\nit back to the Dickinson 36. The Jays punched<br />\nthe ball to the Dickinson six before the final<br />\nwhistle.<br /><br />\nUtz Ground Leader<br />\nSophomore running back Steve Utz led the rushing attack with 151 yards in 13 carries and one<br />\ntouchdown, Dan Augustine gained 119 yards in 24<br />\ntries and logged two TD's, and Steve Hata covered 90 yards in 15 attempts.<br />\nIn all, Hopkins recorded 358 net yards against<br />\nthe 13th toughest college defense in the nation<br />\nwhile the defense allowed only 218 total yards,<br />\nboth passing and rushing for Dickinson.<br />\nIt was an impressive performance for a team<br />\nthat has had trouble finding itself. The win brought<br />\nHopkins at least a piece of its third straight conference crown.<br />\nWhen asked to comment on tomorrow's opponent, Coach Sotir remarked: \"They've lost some<br />\nvery tough games this year. Their record doesn't<br />\nshow their ability.\" Presently, the Green Terrors<br />\nfrom Westminster,Maryland show a 2-6 mark.But<br />\nin the MAC, they log a dismal 1-4 record.<br />\n(Continued on page 17)<br /><br />\nVarsity Soccer Posts 6-2-2 Mark<br />\nAs Jays Tie Western Maryland<br />\nBy ED BRETHAUER<br />\nLast Tuesday, the Varsity Soccer team finished a successful 6-2-2 season by tying another<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference team, Western Maryland, by the score of 0-0. The game was bitterly<br />\nfought by both sides, and demonstrated once again<br />\nthe strength of the Hopkins' defense,playing without the constant checking and hard hitting of John<br />\nClisham, truly the defensive leader of the team.<br />\nSteve Weiss again made several incredible saves,<br />\nwhile Rick Tobey, Gavin Youngquist and Rob Parsley made up well for Clisham's loss.<br />\nThe offense, though, could not seem to gel,<br />\nas it had done against Drexel the previous Saturday. In this game, the offense, led by Scott Tyner, had posted two goals, and had achieved only<br />\nHopkins' second victory over Drexel in 13 meetings. Yet, as captain Randy Miller said, \"We've<br />\nalways had a strong defense, as is evidenced by<br />\nour six shutouts this year. Frequently, however,<br />\nwe just weren't able to put together enough shots<br />\non goal to win a few more games and maybe the<br />\nconference title.\"<br />\nIn the game last Tuesday,Hopkins had few shots<br />\non goal, though there were a couple good crosses<br />\nin front of the net by samper and Tyner, and one<br /><br />\ncontroversial shot by Miller off the goalpost.<br />\nReally, it wasn't till the first overtime period<br />\nthat the Jays, led on by the crowd's cher ring, tried<br />\nto win it all by keeping the ball in front of Western<br />\nMaryland's net. Despite their inability to score<br />\nin the closing minutes, the team showed the good<br />\nspirit and agressiveness, which have been evident<br />\nthroughout this past season.<br />\nThis aspect of the team was mirrored in Coach<br />\nKnauff's remarks at the end of last Tuesday's<br />\ngame, when he said, \"It was a great pleasure for<br />\nme to coach this team and to be connected with<br />\nits success this season. The boys worked hard<br />\nall year, frequently striving above their normal<br />\nability to win or tie games. I can just say that<br />\nI am very pleased, and that every member on<br />\nthe team deserves a lot of credit for our fine<br />\nseason.\"<br />\nSuch players as Danny Hall, Albee Samper,Pat<br />\nBarry, and Gavin Youngquist, truly do deserve<br />\na lot of credit, in addition to the regulars, for<br />\nkeeping the team going when it was plagued by<br />\nInjuries. The players form the strong nucleus<br />\nof next year's team, which should continue to<br />\nbe a strong MAC contender.<br />\n(Continued on page 181<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, Nov. 21, 1969<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\n'PAGE 17<br /><br />\nsportsFrosh Football Ends Season on Winning Note<br />\nThe Freshmen Football team finished<br />\nits season last Friday with a26 to 16 win<br />\nover the Junior Varsity team of Western<br />\nMaryland. Hopkins scored early on an<br />\neighty-five yard sustained drive. The<br />\nscore was made by quarterback Jim Pitts<br />\non a thirty yard sneak over center. The<br />\nFrosh could not make the conversion<br />\nhowever and led 6 to 0.<br />\nThe Freshman quickly added another<br />\ntally on a short sweep by tailback Harry<br />\nTheis, here again the conversion attempt<br />\nfailed. The final Hopkins score of the<br />\nhalf was a Pitts to Tim Wiglecki pass.<br />\nThis time fullback Pat Neary scored the<br />\nconversion to give the Frosh a 20 to 0<br />\nlead.<br />\nThe defense, who had been playing<br />\nwithout error, now began to let down<br />\nand gave Western Maryland a touchdown<br />\nbefore the half ended. The Freshmen<br />\ntook a 20 to 8 lead into the locker room.<br /><br />\nBy the second half, the rain had stopped<br />\nbut the field was a sea of mud. Hopkins<br />\nscored on a two yard plunge by Neary.<br />\nThe touchdown was set up by a Western<br />\nMaryland fumble. Western Maryland<br />\nscored once more late in the game but<br />\n\"cooked their own goose\" in doing so.<br />\nIt took them eight minutes to score on a<br />\nsustained drive which just about used up<br />\nthe clock.<br />\nHopkins had 93 yards in the air. They<br />\nhad almost 200 yards rushing with tailback Theis accounting for 97 yards.

He also notes, \"If we<br />\nhad played as well against everyone as<br />\nwe did against Dickinson, we would have<br />\ngiven anybody on our schedule a good<br />\nfight. We'd almost surely be better than<br />\n5 and 3, but that's past history. Tomorrow's game is the important thing.\"<br />\n\"It means everything to them and to<br />\nus. Although we've got a third of the<br />\nchampionship, we can take all of it with<br />\na win.\"<br /><br />\nTerrors Riding High<br />\nLast year's co-captain and present<br />\nfreshman assistant coach, Don Yablonowitz, mentioned that \"Western Maryland always gets up for the Hopkins<br />\ngame. Their record is not a true indication.\"<br />\nIn preparation for tomorrow's contest, Sotir cites four Western Maryland-<br /><br />\ners who the Blue Jays will be particularly interested in stopping. Senior guarterback Bruce Bozman,no. 16,is considered to be \"one of the best quarterback<br />\nin the MAC.\" He has always done well<br />\nagainst Hopkins. Last year against the<br />\nJays, he was responsible for over 200<br />\nyards as he rushed for one touchdown<br />\nand scored another. This was two-thirds<br />\nof Maryland's offensive punch.<br />\nAt one of the running back slots is<br />\nfreshman Joe Brockmeyer, no. 32. At<br />\n165 pounds, he is not especially big, but<br />\nhe is still dangerous. Several times<br />\nthis year he has gained over a hundred<br />\nyards rushing.<br />\nTwo very good ends compliment Bozman, Randy Klinger, no. 85, at 6-2 and<br />\n190 pounds and Ed Brown, no. 84, at 6-4<br />\nand 220 pounds. The two gave the Terros an excellent passing attack.<br />\nIn the last two games the defense has<br />\ndone an excellent job. Dickinson's two<br />\ntouchdowns were flukes. At any rate<br />\ntomorrow at two o'clock on Homewood<br />\nField the defense will again be called on<br />\nto shut off Western Maryland and turn<br />\nthe ball over to Bob Pfiefer and the rest<br />\nof the offense.<br />\nLast year the Black and Blue struck<br />\nWestern Maryland with a 46-23 defeat.<br />\nThe scoring probably won't be as high<br />\nas last year, but a Blue Jay victory can<br />\nbe predicted,<br /><br />\nof the top freshman teams of recent years.<br />\nof the top freshman teams of recent<br />\nyears. The guys were really primed for<br />\nthis one. It was our best effort of the season. F &amp; M had been undefeated up until<br />\nwe met them.\"<br />\nIn scoring 127 points, the offense averaged slightly better than 25 points a game.<br />\nQuarterback Jim Pitts was responsible<br />\nfor much of the scoring. He threw 10<br />\ntouchdown passes and ran for 2 in the<br />\nfive game season. At 6-2 and 185 pounds<br />\nhe has good size for a quarterback. He<br />\ncompleted 62 passes out of 133 attempted<br />\nfor a 46.6 completion percentage. He<br />\npassed for 870 yards in five games.<br />\nIn the words of Coach Scott, \"he did an<br />\nexcellent job for us.\"<br /><br />\nWeglicki Leading Receiver<br />\nHis primary receiver was Tim Weglicki who scored 8 touchdowns. Weglicki<br />\nhad 37 receptions for 583 yards. His<br />\n51 points placed him first among the<br />\nscorers. He was also singled out by Scott<br />\nfor his excellent job this year. Tight end<br />\nCarroll Phillips was second among receivers with 10 receptions for 156 yards<br />\nand one touchdwon. Joe Konopelski was<br />\na back up offesnvie and defensive end.<br />\na back up offensive and defensive end.<br />\nSecond in scoring was fullback Pat<br />\nNeary. He had 3 touchdown and two conversions for 22 points. Also, with 3 six pointers was the leading ground gainer<br />\nHarry Thies rushed for 383 yards in 81<br />\ncarrries for a 4.7 per carry average.<br />\nScott mentioned the good blocking<br />\nof the interior lineman. Sam Palmisano<br />\nthe center had guards Joe Ouslander and<br />\nFrank Bond to help with the blocking.<br />\nSteve Jefferies and Mike Seider, both<br />\ntackles turned in good season performances.<br /><br />\nHe shared the wingback slot with Hal Altman who was a safety on defense. Art<br />\nMartines also double as a reserve wingback and defensive back.<br />\nStarting defensive halves were Ken<br />\nWinegrad and Kirk Ziegler. Ziegler<br />\nalternated withTim Garton. Coach Scott<br />\nalso mentioned Tim Culbertson who injured his knee early in the season and did<br />\nnot see action until the second Western<br />\nMaryland game.<br /><br />\nReserves Shine<br />\nDefensive backup men in the secondary<br />\nwere Mark Barth and Charlie Kinzig.<br />\nReserve linebackers were Bruce Jackson<br />\nand Allen Peerless. Also GrantSheychik<br />\n\"saw considerable action on both the offensive and defensive units. Phil Ward<br />\nwas the team's kicking specialist. He<br />\nback up offensive and defensive tackle<br />\nwas Mike Slowinski.<br />\nCoach Scott also wanted to express his<br />\nappreciation and praise to assistant Don<br />\nYablonowitz. Scott also wanted to thank<br />\nmanager Bill Moser.<br />\nThe teams four victories were: 21-8<br />\nover Western Maryland, 20-2 over F &amp;<br />\nM, 44-40 over Towson State, and 26-16<br />\nover Western Maryland.

Since then, the plan<br />\nhas painstakingly gone through discussion and recommendation stages in the<br />\nSchool of Medicine, School of Public<br />\nHealth and Hygiene and the Faculty of<br />\nArts and Sciences. It will soon be before the policy-making Advisory Boards<br />\nof the Medical and Hygiene Schools.<br />\nIn a faculty memorandum last month<br />\nsummarizing the Allied Health proposal,<br />\nPresident Lincoln Gordon stated that<br />\n\"the University should estbalish baccalaureate and master's programs in the<br />\nallied health sciences to which students<br />\nwould normally be recruited at the conclusion of their undergraduate sophomore year, having completed stated prerequisites especially in the scientific<br />\nfields.\"<br />\nThese transfer students would enter a<br />\n\"College of Health Sciences\" to complete<br />\na combined baccalaureate-master's degree in either three or four years, according<br />\nto Gordon's<br />\nmemo. The<br /><br />\n\"College\" would be located near the East<br />\nBaltimore medical institutions, and<br />\nwould train nurses and non-doctoral<br />\nmedical personnel.<br />\nImplementation of the Allied Health<br />\nplan, however, will be contingent upon<br />\ngathering new financial resources for the<br />\nprogram, stated Dr. Bevan. Fundsfrom<br />\nthe Federal Government, from the National Institute of Health and from private<br />\nsources will be tapped,Bevan remarked,<br />\nto begin the division.<br />\nIf such funds are not available, the institution of the Allied Health College will<br />\nbe delayed. President Gordon previously<br />\nannounced that money allocated to existing programs will not be touched to start<br />\nthe new school and that the University,<br />\npresently running this year $4 million in<br />\nthe red, cannot afford additional expenditures without more money.<br /><br />\nThe Rationale<br />\nThe rationale behind an Allied Health<br />\ndivision at Hopkins was to train medical<br />\ntechnicians who would absorb many of<br />\nthe functions now performed by doctors.<br />\n\"Doctors do a lot of things that don't<br />\nneed to be done by doctors,\" Bevan explained, \"and what we have in mind is a<br />\nwhole new type of medical personnel who<br />\nwould take over many of their jobs.\"<br />\nThrough this process, Bevan claimed,<br />\nthe quantity of qualified medical personnel would be increased without greatly<br />\nexpanding the number of medical schools<br />\nin the nation. \"Given the present character of medical education, it is impossible to increase the output of doctors<br />\nwithout starting more medical schools<br /><br />\nwhich is extremely costly, and the<br />\ngovernment just doesn't seem to have<br />\nthe money,\" he asserted.<br />\nThree major questions have been posed<br />\nby the opponents of the Allied Health<br />\nplan: why not expand the medical school<br />\nto produce more doctors instead of starting something new, how will a non-doctoral program attract highly - qualified<br />\nstudents, what financial drain will the<br />\nprogram place on the University and<br />\ncould this training function be performed<br />\nby existing trade or vocational schools?<br />\n\"One hears from many medical<br />\nexperts that we are in a near-crisis situation in the medical profession,\" maintained Dr. Francis Carlson professor of<br />\nbiophysics, \"and we should train more<br />\ndoctors instead of starting another baccalaureate program.\" He stated that<br />\nsince a shortage of doctors is now affecting the country,Hopkins, which specializes in such training, should expand its<br />\nmedical school enrollment. \"According<br />\nto the Association of American Medical<br />\nColleges, there are 22,000 filed applications for med schools and 10,000 are admittee each year. We should begin to tap<br />\nthese 12,000 students who have already<br />\nreceived a undergraduate degree before<br />\ntrying to attract a whole new set of<br />\nstudents.\"<br />\nDr. Donald Kerr of Physics feared<br />\nthat the quality of academic instruction<br />\nwould be lowered if Hopkins began training more nurses and medical technicians.<br />\n\"I don't like taking on a lower grade of<br />\nacademic people,\" Kerr remarked. Furthermore, he noted, a new division within the University cannot help but financia-<br /><br />\nDR. WILLIAM BE VAN<br />\nlly hurt the other divisions. \"I would<br />\nthink they would have to take some money<br />\naway from existing programs to finance<br />\nthis,\" he added. the Physics professor<br />\nstated that it is not Hopkins' role to train<br />\nnon-doctors.<br />\nDr. Bevan, however, who will be<br />\ndirectly responsible for the new program, claimed that the Allied Health<br />\nprogram has been misinterpreted, and<br />\ntherefore misrepresented, by its opponents. \"We've been trapped by semantics,\" he declared. \"What we have in<br />\nmind is a whole new type of medical<br />\npersonnel who would become specialists<br />\nIn fields a general practitioner may not<br />\nknow much about.\"<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS IN BRIEF<br />\nFuture Plans<br />\nThe Vietnam Moratorium Committe, which organized<br />\nthe October 15th anti-war demonstrations, but stayed in<br />\nthe background this past weekend, has returned to the<br />\nforefront by announcing plans for December demonstrations.<br />\nSam Brown, a chief spokesman of the committee, announced plans for three days of nationwide protest activities, on December 12, 13, and 24. All of the demonstrations will be local, with no large rallies planned for<br />\nthe near future.<br />\nActivities planned include the leafleting of Christmas shoppers, and public vigils on Christmas eve. Because of the close proximity of the dates to final ecams<br />\nand the Christmas holidays, there was little hope of<br />\nany large scale campus action.<br />\n\"Traditionally, Christmas has been a time when people<br />\nturn their attention to peace on earth,\" Brown stated.<br />\n\"This year...they will also turn their energies to that<br />\ntask.\"<br />\n\"Public vigils and other appropriate activities will be<br />\norganized across the country this Christmas Eve,\"<br />\nBrown added, emphasizing that this in no way implies<br />\nan economic boycott.<br />\nNew Mobilization officials plan to gether in New York<br />\nthis weekend to plan future activities. No plans for a<br />\nmass rally are expected.<br /><br />\nJoplin:No Comfort<br />\nJanis Joplin was arrested Monday night following a<br />\nconcert in Tampa, Fla. for allegedly using profanity<br />\non detectives who interrupted her performance while<br />\ncontrolling the crowd.<br />\nJoplin was charged with two counts Of profanity in<br />\nthe incident which began when part of the 3,500 people<br />\nattending began swarming toward the stage and standing on chairs to get a closer look.<br />\nAfter the hall manager threatened to close down the<br />\nshow, police began moving the audience back. At this<br />\npoint, according to police, Joplin shouted an obscenity<br />\nat the officers and directed several other obscene words<br />\nat one particular detective.<br />\nJoplin was allowed to finish her concert while Sergeant E. D. Williams went to procure a warrant for<br />\nher arrest. She was arrested backstage.<br /><br />\nPeace and Love<br />\nThe wife of Senator Philip A. Hart (D., Mich.) was<br />\none of those arrested at a peace demonstration at the<br />\nPentagon last Thursday.<br />\nExplaining her first brush with the law, the 47-yearold mother of eight said: \"The point was to have<br />\na mass for peace to bring the idea of peace and love of<br />\nGod into the house of death.\"<br />\nInstead, along with 185 others at the Mass for Peace,<br />\nshe was arrested and charged with violating a General<br />\nServices Administration rule against blocking a corridor.<br />\nShe pleaded not guilty, and was released after posting<br />\n$25 bond. She and the others are to appear in court<br />\nJanuary 14.<br />\nMrs. Hart stated that she didn't remember how her<br />\nhusband felt about the whole thing. She did say that she<br />\nwould be \"enthusiastic\" about a repeat Pentagon demonstration.<br />\nIn addition to her political activities, Mrs. Hart is<br />\na licensed pilot and has her own campaign to get women<br />\ninto the space program. She is also finishing her college<br />\neducation, majoring in anthropology at George Washington University,<br /><br />\nDomino Doubts<br />\nSam Houston Johnson, brother of Lyndon Baines,<br />\nstated that the President was torn by doubts about Vietnam in an article in Look magazine.<br />\nSam, who lived in the White House during the Presidents tenure, wrote of a \"particular night in February,<br />\n1968\" when he joined his brother in a game of dominos.<br />\nDuring the game, as Lyndon pondered his next move,<br />\nhe remarked, \"That's just the trouble, Sam Houston,<br />\nit's always my move. And, damn it, I sometimes can't<br />\ntell whether I'm making the right move or not.\"<br />\n\"Now take this Vietnam mess: How in the hell can<br />\nanyone know what's right and what's wrong, Sam? I<br />\ngot some of the finest brains in this country--people<br />\nlike Dean Rusk, Walt Rostow and Dean Acheson--making some awful strong and convincing arguments for us<br />\nto stay in there and not pull out.\"<br />\n\"Then I've got some people like Fulbright and George<br />\nBall, also intelligent men, whose motives I can't rightly<br />\ndistrust--and telling me we've got to de-escalate or run<br />\nthe risk of total war. And Sam, I've got to listen to<br />\nboth sides.\"<br />\nWhile contemplating another move, LI3J told his brother \"I've just got to choose between my opposing experts. No way of avoiding it. But I sure the hell wish<br />\nI could really know what's right.\"<br /><br />\nPast Debts<br />\nNew Mobilization leaders Monday accused the Weathermen of demanding $20,000 in exchange for a promise to<br />\nrefrain from violence during the Washington Moratorium<br />\nactivities.<br />\nStephen Cohen, one of six Moratorium leaders present<br />\nat a meeting last Friday, stated, \"They came in and said<br />\nthey wanted $20,000. They tried to shake us down. They<br />\nwanted protection money. We told them to get lost.\"<br />\n\u2022William Ayers, a Weatherman leader, acknowledged<br />\nthat he and several associates asked the Moratorium<br />\nfor help in meeting legal expenses growing out of disturbances in Chicago. But Ayers denied that any threats<br />\nwere made or implied.<br />\nCohen said the Weathermen put the proposition this<br />\nway: \"We've come to ask you for money for legal defense. After we leave here we're going to decide whether to commit acts of violence. Our decision will be<br />\naffected if we know there is help forthcoming from you.\"<br />\nShortly after the meeting a Weathermen-supported<br />\nrally at Dupont circle resulted in a violent confrontation with police during which twenty people were arrest-<br /><br />\ned4lea11y Blew It'<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University College Bowl team has<br />\nbeen defeated by...Bradley University? Of...Peoria,<br />\nIllinois? But the score was close, 205 to 180.<br />\nThe team member who insists on being acclaimed<br />\nmost responsible for the loss is Edward Mendelsohn,<br />\na sophomore from Far Rockaway, N. Y. By introducing his hero, Alton B. Parker, into the program,<br />\nMendelsohn was able to answer an uncompleted question, successfully. Unfortunately, it was a question<br />\nof his own devising. His other feat occurred at the<br />\ncommencement of the program, when he temporarily<br />\nforgot how to pronounce his own name.<br />\nThe team captain, Kenneth Shepre, of La Grange<br />\nPark, Ill., narrated a film of the campus. I tw as very<br />\nenlightening as it included a picture of the Medical<br />\nSchool, which few of us have ever seen. Also on the<br />\nteam were Bradford Braden of Indianapolis and Ingram<br />\nRoberts of Bethesda, Md.<br />\nThe team member who proved most successful in<br />\ngiving answers was the alternate, Harvey Luksenburg<br />\nof Silver Spring, Md. He greeted his teammates with<br />\na smile and \"You guys really blew it.\"<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40366, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "ea80810e-1b8a-44f3-94e0-49bd0e805956", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13997-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13997, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "75eda20a-4dc8-4da1-9c85-3db02d986efb", "url": "/node/13997"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "281868ad-2830-46ce-aeec-256c1cea6ff8"}]}
