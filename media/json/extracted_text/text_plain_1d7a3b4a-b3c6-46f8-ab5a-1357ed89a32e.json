He<br />\nanswered other questions raised<br />\nby Yoon on the subjects of endowment and the focus of concentrating the central administration. Richardson stated that the<br />\nschool is actively seeking donors<br />\nfor all divisions of the University, and also, that he is trying to<br />\nmake the central administration<br />\nsmaller, \"we are trying to<br />\nremove duplicity of certain positions.\"<br />\nAfter remaining with council<br />\nfor quite some time, President<br />\nRichardson excused himself, and<br />\ncouncil continued with the remainder of the agenda. President<br />\nBob Nelson brought up the<br />\nchange of dates for the Food for<br />\nthe Homeless campaign.

Phi Mu<br />\nhas been offered the soon-to-be vacant Rogers House as a<br />\nmeeting/living/program space. With space at a premium, funding for extras non-existent, and the climate for student life<br />\nan eternally vexing problem, this move once again raises questions about administrative priorities when it comes to student<br />\nissues.<br />\nWhy was Phi Mu offered Rogers House, especially \"under<br />\nthe table,\" as it were, with no public discussion? This question echoes both within Hopkins Greek circles and without.<br />\nOther sororities understandably ask why they were not consulted. While Hopkins is small enough that word of mouth<br />\nsometimes seems more than sufficient, professionalism and<br />\ncourtesy are not unreasonable requests when a valuable commodity is involved and a specific group of students stands to<br />\nbenefit (or lose). Those involved may have felt that they were<br />\nsimply facilitating the most sensible and feasible action, but<br />\nthat attitude merely reinforces power structures already in place<br />\nand stands in the way of individual students working for change.<br />\nThe next obvious question addresses the blatant omission of<br />\nfraternities from consideration. Director of Housing Carol Mohr<br />\ncited different \"behavior expectations\" as the reason for the<br />\nHousing Office's preference that a sorority occupy Rogers<br />\nrather than a fraternity. Does that mean that Phi Mu holds its<br />\nmembers to higher behavior standards, and that Phi Mu is<br />\ntherefore a more appealing candidate for the space? Or does<br />\nthe administration hold sororities to higher standards of<br />\nbehavior? Though some may plead \"common sense\" in this<br />\ninstance, what does that imply? That the administration gave<br />\nthe question thoughtful, objective consideration and came to<br />\nthe conclusion that girls are cleaner, quieter, and easier to<br />\ncontrol\u2014much more desirable as tenants than those nasty frat<br />\nboys?<br />\nThe non-Greek options that received absolutely no attention,<br />\nat least that we know of, are even more disconcerting. Hopkins<br />\nis notorious for its extra-curricular gaps and its ever-present<br />\nhuman climate failings. Rogers House has the potential to fill<br />\na gap in an area not already addressed within the student activity structure. Greeks already offer community living opportunities. How about an Arts House, a Music House, or an International Students House?<br />\nFor too long the administration has relied on the Greek system<br />\nto provide the few social events that exist for undergraduates<br />\nbeyond the dorm structure, which currently serves only<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br />\n<br />\nEpisode Thirteen:<br />\nRaisins and Dates<br />\nMonday nights were special to A three goyim Hannukkah.

Students uncomfortable with the beer-brawl atmosphere and sexual harrassment that can be an integral part<br />\nof the fraternity party scene voice concern and, when met with<br />\nblank administrative stares, take matters into their own hands.<br />\nSeveral new HOP events and Funk Night at the Grad Club(now<br />\ngone, as a result of unrelated administrative restrictions) were<br />\njust a few of the positive results. Yet when an opportunity arises<br />\nfor the administration to match students' efforts with a little<br />\nof its own initiative, a Greek organization is foremost in the<br />\nminds of those who decide.<br />\nIronically, this issue has arisen at the same time that the mandatory sophomore housing was initiated as formal policy by<br />\nthe Homewood Deans. Opposition to mandatory housing has<br />\nreceived little attention, but there are several reasonable<br />\narguments against requiring that sophomores live in Wolman.<br />\nIt is commendable that the administration has taken steps toward<br />\noffering attractive, affordable community living options for<br />\nupper-classmen. This single step could prove to be a giant stride<br />\ntoward alleviating student life problems.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the administration lacks confidence in<br />\nits product to such an extent that it must require students to<br />\nlive there in order to insure \"success.\" Why not try recommended sophomore, junior, and senior housing, and let individuals decide for themselves?<br />\nThe only exemption from mandatory housing that has received definitive support from the administration is for students who<br />\nwish to live in a Greek house. This formalizes a structure that<br />\nquite unfortunately has been implicitly reinforced for many<br />\nyears\u2014the Greeks offer the only sanctioned alternatives, first<br />\nfor social events, now for housing.<br />\nRenovations to Wolman Hall and the subsequent availability of Rogers House presented the administration with an opportunity to make an innovative addition to the Hopkins community. University-owned space such as Rogers lends itself to<br />\nmany uses, the breadth of which remain unknown because the<br />\ndialogue that would bring to light the ideas and current needs<br />\nof the student body has yet to take place.<br />\nInstead, the administration chose the easy solution. Phi Mu<br />\nis well-established on campus and has the financial stability of<br />\na national organization behind it. Offering the house to Phi Mu<br />\neliminated messy details and pre-empted a potentially complicated (and revealing) dialogue. The administration has once<br />\nagain dispelled hopes that, buried beneath a well-earned reputation resulting from years of neglect, someone genuinely cares<br />\nabout and seeks creative solutions to insidious weaknesses in<br />\nthe quality of student life at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nA Salute to the Hopkins Antiwar Movement, Circa Vietnam; A Raspberry<br />\nto Newl-Letter(?) Coverage of the Current Movement; Kappa Sig Rebuts<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a senior history major who has<br />\nwritten a paper on Hopkins and Vietnam War and is currently writing a<br />\nthesis on the antiwar movement in<br />\nBaltimore, I feel compelled to respond to Harry Milling's comments<br />\non Vietnam era activism at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nMilling quotes Professor Doris<br />\nEntwisle as saying the movement at<br />\nHopkins was not especially organized or as severe as at other schools.<br />\nCertainly, the level of visible activism and the use of violence at<br />\nHopkins was extremely low. As Lincoln Gordon, the President of the<br />\nUniversity during the 1960's, was<br />\nfond of saying, no injuries or<br />\ndamage to property occurred at<br />\nHopkins during the war.<br />\nNevertheless, to say that activism<br />\nand the war did not significantly affect Hopkins is wrong. Several facts<br />\nare important here. First, Hopkins<br />\nactivists, while small in number,<br />\nestablished one of the first chapters<br />\nof Students for a Democratic<br />\nSociety in 1961 and remained active<br />\nthroughout the debacle.<br />\nSecond, Hopkins students, faculty, and especially the former<br />\nChaplain, Chester Wickwire, played<br />\nand important role in the city antiwar<br />\nmovement. Numerous meetings of<br />\nvarious campus and city-wide antiwar groups were held in Levering<br />\nHall under the auspices of the<br />\nChaplain.<br />\nThird, by 1970 radicalism and major student unrest had come to<br />\nHopkins. During the course of April<br />\nand May,students organized a strike<br />\nof classes in protest of the presence<br />\nof military recruiters on campus. A<br />\nstudent referendum against<br />\nrecruiters was passed with over 80<br />\npercent of students participating.<br />\nFourth, a group of students and<br />\nsupportive faculty entered an<br />\nAcademic Council meeting without<br />\npermission in May, 1970. After a<br />\nhearing, they were subsequently<br />\nsuspended for the summer session.<br />\nFifth, administrators, including<br />\nclose aides to President Gordon,<br />\nwere concerned with student activism and spent a significant amount<br />\nof their time investigating possible<br />\nunrest.<br />\nSixth, many of the issues affecting<br />\nstudents in the late 1960's and early<br />\n1970's were not related to the war.<br />\nAt Hopkins, students were concered<br />\nwith governance issues, coeducation, dorm life regulations, minority issues, and the state of the<br />\ncurriculum.<br />\n<br />\nIt is a mistake to overlook the importance of campus issues and only<br />\nfocus on the war because all of these<br />\nissues and movements were intimatley related. In sum, Hopkins<br />\nwas not Columbia or Cornell, but it<br />\nwas not devoid of activism either. In<br />\nan age where scholarship is beginning to examine secondary cities and<br />\ncolleges which may not have received widespread media attention,<br />\nit is important that we not overlook<br />\nthe fact that the antiwar movement<br />\nwas truly national and that Johns<br />\nHopkins and Baltimore played roles<br />\nin the struggle against the Vietnam<br />\nWar.<br />\nJonathan Roberts<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was happy to see so much<br />\ncoverage of the war and how it affects this community in last week's<br />\nissue of the News-Gazette. However,<br />\nI was shocked at the reporting in the<br />\narticle entitled \"Hopkins Students,<br />\nAlums in Gulf.\" When Kathleen<br />\nCurry says, in her second sentence,<br />\n\"Thousands of demonstrators, both<br />\nsupporting and opposing U.S. intervention in the Middle East have<br />\ncongregated in Washington, D.C.<br />\nduring the past two weeks.. .\"she<br />\nis painting a false and terribly<br />\nmisleading picture.<br />\nI went to Washington on January<br />\n19 and 26, to both of the demonstrations Ms. Curry refers to. On<br />\nJanuary 19, there were 25,000 protesters against the war in the Persian<br />\nGulf; by generous estimates there<br />\nwere 100 supporters of the war. On<br />\nJanuary 26, there were at least<br />\n75,000 protesters of the war and<br />\neven fewer than 100 supporters.<br />\nThese are D.C. police estimates, the<br />\nmost conservative ones I could cite<br />\n(the organizers of the January 26<br />\n<br />\nprotest for peace numbered the protesters at more than 200,000).<br />\nIs there any objective truth in<br />\ndescribing these two Saturday proof<br />\n\"thousands<br />\nas<br />\ntests<br />\ndemonstrators, both supporting and<br />\nopposing U.S. intervention . . .\"?<br />\nPut together, more than 100,000<br />\nvoices gathered in Washington to express their opposition to the war in<br />\nthe Persian Gulf. There was a handful of supporters.<br />\nI am dismayed to see an independent newspaper, a student<br />\nnewspaper, imitate the very worst of<br />\nthe mass media in its coverage of the<br />\nwar. If the News-Gazette wants to<br />\ndeclare its stand on the war, that's<br />\nfine. But when you publish a news<br />\narticle, you have an obligation as<br />\njournalists to present the facts<br />\nobjectively.<br />\nMary Shaffer<br />\nEds'note: We assume that the NewsLetter is the publication in question,<br />\nas we are unfamiliar with the NewsGazette.

In describing one<br />\nparticular incident, which was done<br />\nto her by an Alpha Tao Omega, and<br />\nonly Alpha Tao Omega, she labeled<br />\nall Greeks as immature buffoons,<br />\nwho only band together in order to<br />\npromote and perpetuate sexism,<br />\nracism, and misogyny.

For the first time<br />\nin the centuries-old tradition of<br />\nwar, a war is being witnessed not<br />\nonly by the battlefield commanders in country, but by<br />\nAmericans<br />\nand<br />\nIraqis<br />\nsimultaneously, as it happens (or<br />\nlive if you prefer). What a<br />\nfascinating concept: to hear and<br />\nsee the bombs bursting in air<br />\nfrom the comfort of your own<br />\nhome.<br />\nCertainly the very face of battle has changed. The public<br />\neagerly consumes any information that is doled out by the<br />\nmedia, or the military and its<br />\nand<br />\nIraqi<br />\ncensors\u2014both<br />\nAmerican. Yet many times the<br />\nmedia reports a breaking story<br />\nonly to find out later that it is untrue or partially true. Similarly,<br />\nPentagon and Department of<br />\nDefense officials have been accused of repressing potentially<br />\nembarrassing news stories or<br />\nmilitary information for several<br />\ndays. When the flood of information from the war is not only<br />\noverwhelming but contradictory,<br />\nerroneous conclusions are inevitable. A few statements caught<br />\nmy eye, though, so I've compiled my very own \"Top 10 List<br />\nof Gulf Follies.\"<br />\n10. Iraq had no legitimate<br />\ngrievances or claims against<br />\nKuwait. Through a process<br />\nknown as \"slant drilling,\"<br />\nKuwait was widely suspected of<br />\ntaking more than its share of oil<br />\nfrom the Rumalia oil fields on its<br />\nborder with Iraq. As in many<br />\ncountries in the Middle East, Iraq<br />\nstill seethes over border lines that<br />\nwere drawn by foreigners, namely the British.<br />\n9. Saddam Hussein wasfoolish<br />\nto invade Kuwait. Our wonderful State Department had told<br />\nHussein less than a month before<br />\nthe invasion that the U.S. had<br />\n\"no opinion\" about border<br />\ndisputes. Hussein's army is so<br />\nlarge that many military experts<br />\nfelt he had to use it or lose it.<br />\nWith the $2 billion infusion of<br />\ncash and riches pilfered from<br />\nKuwait, it was a sweet deal.<br />\n8. The Arabs in the allied coalition won'tfight. While President<br />\nBush obviously had political aims<br />\nin mind, the coalition that he<br />\nassembled is a formidable one.<br />\nGround troops and armored divisions from Egypt and Syria, Tornado jets from Britian, and<br />\ncountless other nations' ships in<br />\nthe Gulf all play critical military<br />\nroles. Saudis, Kuwaits, and<br />\nQuataris have already displayed<br />\ntheir military might in Khalil'.<br />\n7. The coalition will splinter if<br />\nIsrael counter-attacks. For<br />\n<br />\nYitzhak Shamir.<br />\n5. The United States wants to<br />\ndemolish Iraq's military.<br />\nChemical, biological, and nuclear<br />\nweapons in Iraq were clearly<br />\nU.S. military targets since August<br />\n2. If Iraq's army is reduced to<br />\nsmithereens, its two neighbors,<br />\nIran and Syria, could move in to<br />\nset up shop, possibly partitioning<br />\nIraq. Yet if Iraq is simply beaten<br />\nback from Kuwait with missiles,<br />\nchemicals, high-tech planes, and<br />\nits leader still intact, would the<br />\nU.S. declare victory? The<br />\nmilitary is actively seeking a<br />\nbalance\u2014a very fine line\u2014<br />\nbetween Iraq's destruction and its<br />\ncapitulation. Nothing less than the<br />\nstability of the Middle East is at<br />\nstake.<br />\n4. Air power can pound Saddam into submission. If you<br />\nhaven't heard yet, we're pounding and Saddam isn't submitting. Even if the Iraqis surrendered en masse, we'd have to<br />\n\"mop up.\" Most military planners in the U.S. never really<br />\nbelieved air power could knock<br />\n<br />\noi<br />\n,\u2022 ON ,fl<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nTr'S So ... `)0 B.F.:AK(<br />\n<br />\nLr<br />\n<br />\nr is 4)35)10r.-ay 8,4 .gw<br />\n<br />\nMOCi-1.)<br />\n<br />\nf NEED A PURPOSE!<br />\n<br />\n6 DIRELTION!<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n(I 11111 )1 11<br />\n<br />\n\"///<br />\n<br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nSaddam out by itself. The dammage wrought by the U.S. is<br />\nsignificant, but Hussein has dug<br />\nin his tanks, communications<br />\nlines, and troops are largely<br />\nprotected.<br />\n3. American protesters are hurting our troop morale. Most, if<br />\nnot all, protests are aimed at<br />\n<br />\nTen myths about<br />\nabout the War in<br />\nthe Gulf...<br />\n<br />\npoliticians: Congress and the<br />\nPresident, or the Pentagon itself.<br />\nProtesters question the motives of<br />\n<br />\nthe war, not the integrity of<br />\nPrivate Joe Smith. On the contrary, wives, husbands, and<br />\n<br />\nchildren are rallying around the<br />\nflag in support of their spouses,<br />\nfathers, and mothers in country.<br />\nAbove all, the U.S. is a<br />\ndemocracy that tolerates protests,<br />\nboth sincere and ludicrous, in<br />\nrespect to free speech.<br />\n2. Saddam Hussein is a madman. Well, there is only one man<br />\nwho has been likened to Adolf<br />\nHitler, has gassed his own people, and who regularly executes<br />\nhis own officers. Yet Hussein is<br />\nby no means mad: he is clever,<br />\npowerful, and above all, ambitious. Since he can't quit<br />\nKuwait(prelude to a coup) he has<br />\ndug in his troops. Side attractions<br />\nhave included lobbing missiles at<br />\nIsrael (killing innocent civilians),<br />\npouring hundreds of millions of<br />\ngallons of oil into the Gulf<br />\n(wreaking ecological havoc), and<br />\ntransferring 95 or so planes to<br />\n<br />\nIran, his former arch-enemy.<br />\n<br />\nWhen analyzed, his intentions are<br />\nlogical. His actions would, if successful, create and Arab-Israeli<br />\nwar; parch the allies' throats due<br />\nto a lack of drinking water; and<br />\ndraw Iran into the conflict,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAnd now, you've guessed it,<br />\nthe number one Gulf folly:<br />\nI. The ground war will be long<br />\n<br />\nand bloody. I don't need mention<br />\nthat I'm cashing in my chips on<br />\nthis one. From the very beginning of the November 8 buildup\u2014<br />\nannounced conveniently two days<br />\nafter U.S. elections\u2014Bush knew<br />\nthat the American public could<br />\nnot stand a ground war leading to<br />\ntens of thousands of U.S.<br />\ncasualties. After softening up Iraq<br />\ntroops from the air, Bush need<br />\nonly achieve one of two objectives: cut off the Iraqi army's<br />\nfood or its water.<br />\nFirst, the U.S. may attempt to<br />\n<br />\nliterally stop the flow of supplies<br />\ninto Kuwait. Trucks bearing<br />\nfood, ammunition, fuel, and<br />\nspare parts are constantly streaming into Kuwait, at the rate of<br />\nhundreds, or even thousands, of<br />\ntrucks each day. Squadrons of<br />\nB-52's have bombed bridges,<br />\nhighways, depots, and truck con-<br />\n<br />\n...and a look<br />\nat the logic<br />\nbehind them<br />\n<br />\nvoys. Some American planners<br />\nboast they can cut supplies to<br />\nKuwait to as little as 1/10th of<br />\nwhat would normally be needed<br />\nto sustain such an enormous occontinued on page 7<br />\n<br />\nree<br />\neecii<br />\n<br />\nseveral months, the U.S. has<br />\nbeen lobbying Syria, Jordan, and<br />\neven Iran to show restraint if<br />\nIsrael should become involved.<br />\nSince Israel did not execute a preemptive strike against Iraq, the<br />\nU.S. is fairly confident that any<br />\nIsraeli involvement would do<br />\nminimal damage to the coalition.<br />\n6. Israel stands to gainfrom the<br />\nwar.

People have given<br />\nmany reasons for \"why we must<br />\ngo to war.\" In my opinion, the<br />\npossible outcomes of this war<br />\nhave not been considered. Iraq<br />\nmay end up defeated and disarmed, which from our viewpoint<br />\ncan't be bad. But there are other<br />\nfactors at play. War is a simplistic<br />\nsolution to a more complex problem. Here are the outcomes<br />\nabout which one only hears lip<br />\nservice on CNN:<br />\n1. Destabilization of regional<br />\nregimes. Dr. Ashraf Ghani and<br />\nother have discussed the convulsions which could result from the<br />\nwar through much of the Middle<br />\nEast\u2014in Jordan, Egypt, and<br />\nelsewhere. Such revolutions may<br />\ntopple hoary monarchies, but<br />\nthey may also install more<br />\nnationalistic dictators like Saddam<br />\nHussein.<br />\n2. Disruption of lasting peace<br />\nin the Middle East. Israel,<br />\nunderstandably, will become<br />\nmore reluctant to have a Palestinian state on its border. Countries<br />\nlike Syria, Iran, and Libya may<br />\nemerge to occupy the power vacuum created by Iraq's defeat,<br />\nand none of them are known for<br />\ntheir peacefulness or human<br />\nrights record. The Lebanese civil<br />\nwar, fueled by increased factionalism, may intensify. This is<br />\na formula for more war, not for<br />\npeace, setting back possibilities<br />\nfor disarmament of chemical and<br />\nnuclear weapons, an arms agreement which foreign policy experts consider \"essential.\"<br />\n3. Exacerbation of economic<br />\ntensions. If Kuwait's oil-wealthy<br />\n<br />\ntrk<br />\n1%<br />\n<br />\n111111t11<br />\n..,111in<br />\n<br />\nemir is restored to power, the old<br />\nregional tensions will be worse<br />\nthan ever. \"Liberated\" Kuwait<br />\nmay return to the monarchy it<br />\nwas before. Under the emir's<br />\nrule, it had merely nominal<br />\ndemocracy, gave no rights for<br />\nforeign workers, and showed a<br />\ntendency to invest its wealth in<br />\nWestern real estate rather than in<br />\nits Arab neighbors. Already existing anti-Western sentiment<br />\namong Arabs will not be aided by<br />\nthe U.S. returning the emir to<br />\npower.<br />\n4. Widening ofthe 'credibility<br />\ngap.'Many people are wondering why the U.S. has singled out<br />\nIraq for this treatment, having ignored expansionism on the part<br />\nof South Africa, murdering of<br />\ncitizens by China, brutal suppression by the Soviet Union, and<br />\nhuman rights violations in<br />\nGuatemala, among countless<br />\nother nations with records of<br />\nsimilar behavior. We are not at<br />\nwar with any of these other<br />\ncountries, suggesting that the key<br />\n<br />\nIraq, with our access to foreign<br />\noil being assured again, complacent America suddenly will forget<br />\nall this talk about conservation<br />\nand alternative energy, just as it<br />\ndid after the Arab embargoes of<br />\nthe 1970's. It will go back to using oil, a limited fossil fuel that<br />\nincreases global warming and<br />\npollutes our beaches, rather than<br />\ndeveloping a consistent energy<br />\npolicy.<br />\n6. Future Iraqi threat. A<br />\ndefeated Iraq will not give up the<br />\nidea that Kuwait historically<br />\nbelongs to them. A cunning new<br />\nleader, perhaps one of Saddam's<br />\n<br />\nof the Cold War, new alliances<br />\nare being formed. Many analysts<br />\nsee a new era of tension betweeen<br />\nthe nations of the industrialized<br />\nNorth (the U.S., Soviets, etc.)<br />\nand the underdeveloped South<br />\n(the Middle East, Africa, Latin<br />\nAmerica, and other Third World<br />\nnations.) This conflict can only<br />\nincrease such tensions. A new<br />\n<br />\nA defeated Iraq will not give up the idea that Kuwait<br />\nhistorically belongs to them. A cunning new leader, perhaps one<br />\nof Hussein's lieutenants, may come back to fan the flames<br />\nof revenge and resentment against the West.<br />\nfactor in this conflict is oil. The<br />\nmoral ground of the U.S. as International Policeman will be<br />\nundermined even more. Possibly,<br />\nthe U.S. may be seen as a 'Hessian' state selling out its military<br />\nprowess to the highest bidder.<br />\n5. Problems at home. A<br />\ndeepening recession, combined<br />\nwith a banking system in trouble,<br />\nand a war economy (even with<br />\nheavy subsidies coming from our<br />\nforeign bankrollers), can only be<br />\na recipe for disaster. If we defeat<br />\n<br />\nlieutenants, may come back to fan<br />\nthe flames of revenge and resentment against the West.(One such<br />\nleader in 1930's Europe was<br />\nAdolf Hitler, whose name has appeared in so many far-fetched<br />\nanalogies already.) The alternative to this situation is continued military occupation, which<br />\nmay create more problems than<br />\nit solves.<br />\n7. The new NATO: North versus South? With East-West tensions dying down due to the end<br />\n<br />\narms race will mean the so-called<br />\n'peace dividend' will be spent and<br />\nthe games of military escalation<br />\nwill begin.<br />\n8. Environmental obliteration.<br />\nOil fields in the area may burn<br />\n\"for up to months\" says one<br />\nmilitary expert. This would<br />\nrelease vast amounts of pollution.<br />\nAttacks on ships and refineries<br />\nmay spill more oil to add to the<br />\noil Saddam is already dumping<br />\ninto t he sea. Bombing of nuclear,<br />\nbiological, and chemical facilities<br />\n<br />\nmay release vast amounts of toxin into neighboring areas and not<br />\njust Iraq. Craters and unexploded shells may mar the desert<br />\necology of the region for a long<br />\ntime. Archaeological sites, part of<br />\nIraq's cultural environment, may<br />\nalso be levelled.<br />\nSince continuing the war is not<br />\na feasible option, we must consider ways to end it. The first important thing is to declare a ceasefire. Next there should be a rotation out of U.S. military troops,<br />\nto be replaced by U.N. multinational forces. Following that<br />\nshould be negotiations involving<br />\nthe following demands on Iraq:<br />\nmandatory disarmament of<br />\ngenocidal weapons; phased<br />\nwithdrawal from Kuwait; release<br />\nof all hostages and POW's. Sanctions should be stepped up to to<br />\nassure compliance. Discussion of<br />\nother matters, such as the Palestinians and disputed oil fields,<br />\nwould follow after these preconditions are met. War crimes trials<br />\nfor Hussein can and should be<br />\nconsidered, but the people of Iraq<br />\ndo not deserve to pay for his<br />\nmindless hatred through excessive reparations.<br />\n<br />\nSecond<br />\nThought<br />\nContinued from page 5<br />\ncupying force.<br />\nSecond, and most important, is<br />\nwater. Unlike the allies, Iraqi<br />\nsoldiers aren't able to kick back<br />\nand enjoy an \"Evian\" when they<br />\nplease. A sizable amount of the<br />\nwater entering Kuwait arives<br />\nfrom Basra, a large city in<br />\nsoutheastern Iraq. If the allies can<br />\nhit the pumping plant (or<br />\npipelines to Kuwait)and damage<br />\nthem slightly. Hussein's ground<br />\nforces will be weakened more<br />\ndramatically than they would be<br />\nby even 6 monthes of bombing:<br />\nCombat conditions would further<br />\nweaken the Iraqis. The ground<br />\nwar will still cost many U.S. and<br />\nallied lives, but not nearly as<br />\nmany as it would have if it had<br />\nbegun on January 15.<br />\nSaddam Hussein yearns and<br />\npines for the \"mother of all battles\" to take place: a down and<br />\ndirty U.S. and allied ground offensive against strong, reinforced, dug-in Iraqi troops. Yet<br />\nif Bush gets his way, that is one<br />\nbattle that Hussein\u2014not to mention American troops\u2014will never<br />\nsee.<br />\n<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nHILLCREST CLINIC<br />\nPrompt confidential help<br />\n\u2022 FREE PREGNANCY TESTING<br />\n\u2022 ABORTION SERVICES<br />\n\u2022 BIRTH CONTROL SERVICES<br />\nFOR APPOINTMENTS CALL:<br />\n<br />\n788-4400<br />\n<br />\n\u2022SONOGRAMS<br />\n\u2022 COUNSELING<br />\n\u2022 COMMUNITY EDUCATION<br />\n<br />\nOpen Mon Sat<br />\n830500pm<br />\n5,602 Baltimore National Pike *600<br />\n<br />\n3101 St. Paul<br />\n<br />\n243-5228<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS STORE<br />\n<br />\nSend early.

His detailed review, as well as that of Paul<br />\nKramer, only highlight the flippancy of reviewer Dave Edelman. Mr.<br />\nEdelman, given the fourplays and<br />\nthree monologues produced in this<br />\nyear's Theatre Lab, finds only<br />\nenough criticism to fill three columns, equal to that which Mr.<br />\nKramer devotes to one film.<br />\nMoreover, Mr. Edelman's appraisals of each show seem inadequate. He writes, for instance, that<br />\nunderstudy Julia Ro delivered a<br />\nstellar performance of Rebecca Garron's monologue \"Deconstruction\".<br />\nI am in perfect agreement with him.<br />\nHowever, he continues: \"Garron<br />\nherself would not have done a better one [performance]\"; and yet, he<br />\nnever once saw Garron perform the<br />\nmonologue.<br />\nMr. Edelman reveals also a<br />\nmisunderstanding of his topic as concerns Michelle Clay's performance<br />\nin Seven Ways to Jack. He writes<br />\nthat Ms. Clay's role was far easier<br />\nthan that of Joshua Coleman,<br />\nbecause she had no dialogue. Those<br />\nof us in the audience could see that<br />\nher performance as an autistic<br />\n<br />\nwoman was no easy feat; she not only created a character for herself, but<br />\nwas crucial to the development of<br />\nMr. Coleman's angry and frustrated<br />\nJack.<br />\nI agree with many of Mr.<br />\nEdelman's criticisms, namely those<br />\nconcerning The Party, in which I<br />\nperformed. As a performer,<br />\nhowever, I am sensitive to Mr.<br />\nEdelman's abrupt treatment of nearly all issues and themes of the plays.<br />\nIf Arturo Interian's Homestead Shuffle followed a formula, what was it<br />\nand where did it come from? If Ms.<br />\nGarron's \"Deconstruction\" has<br />\nbeen done before, then where? How<br />\nwas Jessica Matthewson's The Party technically sloppy? And why no<br />\nmention of the significance of the<br />\nGoucher Students to the production?<br />\nAs a point of information to Mr.<br />\nEdelman, two of the plays, Seven<br />\nWays to Jack and The Party, were<br />\nwritten by Goucher students. Much<br />\nof the acting and nearly all of the<br />\ntechnical production was completed<br />\nby Goucher. Yet, there was no mention of their contribution.<br />\nI repeat that I respect Mr.<br />\nEdelman's point of view concerning<br />\nhis criticisms.

The verbal<br />\ncomprehension sections will ask<br />\nquestions based on reading<br />\npassages (of approximately 500<br />\nwords) drawn from the<br />\nhumanities, sciences, and social<br />\nsciences. Meanwhile, the<br />\nphysical sciences section will<br />\n<br />\nconsist of questions from physics<br />\nand general chemistry. Furthermore, the biological sciences section will have questions from<br />\nbiology and organic chemistry.<br />\nThe written section will consist of<br />\ntwo essays that will test the student's ability to write logically,<br />\ncoherently, and thoughtfully on a<br />\ngeneral topic.<br />\nWith the previous MCAT,the<br />\nwriting sample was not graded,<br />\nbut now the essay will be assigned a grade from J-T(T being the<br />\nhighest). The new format has<br />\nomitted two previous sections:<br />\nscience and quantitative problems. The basic science questions requiring memorization will<br />\n<br />\nremain the same. The new format<br />\nwill reduce the test time by one<br />\nhour. \"The shorter test time will<br />\nmake the MCATs more<br />\nhumane,\" says Dr. John Gryder,<br />\npremedical advisor at Hopkins.<br />\nGryder believes that whether<br />\nthe new MCAT will be easier<br />\nthan the old format really depends<br />\non the individual. Students who<br />\npossess reading and writing skills<br />\nwill have an advantage over those<br />\nwho do well on rote memorization. \"The English requirement<br />\nfor getting admission to medical<br />\nschool should not be taken lightly as before,\" added Gryder.<br />\nAs to why the MCAT has<br />\nchanged, Leslie Sporn, ad-<br />\n<br />\nThe NEW 1991 MCAT<br />\n85 minutes<br />\n<br />\n65 Questions<br />\n<br />\nVerbal Reasoning<br />\n<br />\nA.<br />\n<br />\n100 minutes<br />\n<br />\n77 Questions<br />\n<br />\nPhysical Sciences<br />\n<br />\nB.<br />\n<br />\n10 minutes<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n60 minutes<br />\n<br />\nlunch<br />\n<br />\n60 minutes<br />\n<br />\n2 Essays<br />\n<br />\nWriting Sample<br />\n<br />\nC.<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n10 minutes<br />\n<br />\nbreak<br />\nI).<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\n,<br />\n<br />\nBiological Sciences<br />\n<br />\nStudents who<br />\npossess<br />\nreading and<br />\nwriting skills<br />\nwill have an<br />\nadvantage...<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\nbreak<br />\n<br />\nministrator at Kaplan Education,<br />\nwhich gives prepartory courses to<br />\nhundreds of students every year<br />\nsays that medical schools wanted<br />\nthe change. \"Medical schools are<br />\nseeking physicians with a broad<br />\nfocus and communications<br />\nskills,\" said Sporn.

By using DNA<br />\npolymorphisms (differences in<br />\nDNA) obtained from both<br />\nparents, their studies have shown<br />\nthat 95 percent of all cases of the<br />\ndisorder are due to maternal errors of meiosis.<br />\n\"By looking at families with<br />\nthe disorder, we can see why<br />\nmeiosis goes wrong and<br />\nchromosome 21 is passed on as<br />\nan inherited trait,\" explains Dr.<br />\nAndrew Warren, researcher at<br />\nthe Medical Center. \"The map of<br />\nchromosome 21 is very detailed<br />\nfor such a small chromosome,<br />\nand through genetic markers we<br />\n<br />\nare trying make a complete<br />\ngenetic map that would explain<br />\nthe<br />\netiology<br />\nof Down<br />\nSyndrome.\"<br />\nDown Syndrome, the most<br />\ncommon genetic cause of mental<br />\nretardation, is a chromosomal<br />\nanomaly. Affected individuals<br />\nhave 47 chromosomes instead of<br />\nthe normal 46. This irreversible<br />\ncondition, characterized by slow<br />\nphysical development and flattish<br />\nskull and facial features, is commonly referred as trisomy 21.<br />\nPast chromosomal studies have<br />\nshown<br />\nthat<br />\nthis<br />\nextra<br />\nchromosome 21 is the result of<br />\nnondisjunction<br />\nwhere<br />\nhomologous chromosomes fail to<br />\nseparate during the anaphase<br />\nstage of cell division either on the<br />\nfirst or second meiotic division.<br />\nAbout 95 percent of all Down<br />\n<br />\nSyndrome cases are due to 3<br />\ncomplete copies (trisomy) of<br />\nchromosome 21, which is the<br />\nsmallest chromosome found in<br />\nman's genome. \"The extra<br />\nchromosome is due to reduced<br />\nrecombination, because recombination of chromosomes is important for correct meiosis to occur.\" explains Warren, \"and in<br />\nmany species recombination is<br />\nneccessary for orderly disjunction<br />\nto occur. No recombination<br />\nresults in increased frequencies on<br />\nnondisjunction tor reasons no one<br />\nknows.\"<br />\nShortly after the discovery of<br />\ntrisomy 21, genetic studies<br />\ndemonstrated that not all cases of<br />\nDown Syndrome are due to an<br />\nextra copy of chromosome 21.<br />\nAlthough occurring at lower frequencies (of about 2-3 percent),<br />\n<br />\nDown's is also caused by<br />\nreciprocal translocation between<br />\ntwo chromosomal groups in<br />\nwhich a small part of<br />\nchromosome 21 is fused to<br />\nanother chromosome of another<br />\ngroup which interestingly, results<br />\nin trisomy 21.<br />\nPresently it is unknown why<br />\ntranslocation results in Down<br />\nSyndrome. However, geneticists<br />\nhave found this to be very important in determining which genes<br />\non chromosomes 21 are responsible for causing the disorder.<br />\n\"By looking at chromosomes of<br />\npeople with partial trisomy where<br />\nthere is a tiny bit of extra<br />\nchromosome 21,\" explains Warren, \"and from this we are trying to find the part that is needed<br />\nto inherit Down's minimal<br />\nphenotypes.\" Warren continued<br />\n<br />\nby saying,\"We are currently trying to find more markers in that<br />\nregion by tracking more genes<br />\nthrough DNA polymorphisms.\"<br />\nThe old method of identifying<br />\nthe origin of the extra<br />\nchromosome was subjective;<br />\ngeneticists looked at the parent's<br />\nchromosomes from under a<br />\nmicroscope (karotyping). From<br />\nthe chormosomal dfferences or<br />\nsimilarities, geneticists determined if the child's extra 21st<br />\nchromosome looked like more of<br />\nthe mother's or the father's. This<br />\nmethod had limited accurracy in<br />\nof<br />\norigin<br />\nlocating<br />\nthe<br />\nnondisjunction.<br />\n\"Using developed DNA<br />\npolymorphisms obtained from<br />\nsouthern blotting is more accurate<br />\nand informative,\" explained Warren. DNA poylmorphisms allow<br />\n<br />\ngeneticist to look more closely at<br />\nthe DNA that makes up the<br />\nchromosome. \"From the patterns<br />\nof polymorphisms or the differnet<br />\nfragments obtained from restrictive enzymes digest, geneticists<br />\nare able to see the differences that<br />\nare inherited as different genetic<br />\ntraits,\" explained Warren, \"and<br />\nby comparing patterns of the obtained DNA from the father and<br />\nthe mother, we are able to tell<br />\nwhich chromosome 21 are from<br />\nwhich parent.\"<br />\n\"The use of poylmorphisms<br />\nwill help medical researchers<br />\nunderstand what happens to a<br />\nmother's egg when she has a<br />\nchild with Down Syndrome,\"<br />\nsays Stylianos Antonarakis,<br />\nM.D., \"giving us a better<br />\nunderstanding of the mechanisms<br />\nof the disorder.\"<br />\n<br />\n\u00b0SPRING BREAK 91\"<br />\nCANCUN, MEXICO<br />\nFEATURING THE OASIS CANCUN HOTEL<br />\nSTARTING MARCH 16, 1991<br />\nTHRU MARCH 23, 1991<br />\n<br />\n235 W.

This match was a<br />\nconference sectional, where 6<br />\nteams from schools all over the<br />\nNortheast came to participate in<br />\na founday shootout. The Hopkins<br />\nteam competed in both the<br />\nsmallbore and air rifle divisions,<br />\nspending the entire day of Saturday on the firing line.<br />\nLast week the team won two air<br />\nrifle matches, placing them ahead<br />\nof Princeton as the leaders of the<br />\nHigh Marksman division. Considering this is such a young<br />\nteam, with two freshmen, three<br />\nsophomores and one senior, it<br />\nlooks like this could be the<br />\nstrongest rifle team Hopkins has<br />\nseen in a long time. The team is<br />\nlooking for additional experienced shooters to add to its<br />\nranks, hoping that increased competition between the teammates<br />\nwill produce even higher scores.<br />\n\"We'd like to see a few women<br />\ntry out,\" says Coach Samuel<br />\nHardy. \"Female shooters have<br />\nphysical advantages over male<br />\nshooters\u2014lower center of gravity, wider hips.

All of the following are major reasons condoms fail<br />\nto work except: a) people don't use them in the first<br />\nplace, b) people use them incorrectly, c) they are poorly manufactured, d) people store them incorrectly<br />\nbefore'.<br />\nAnswer true or false:<br />\n11. 'Natural' or sheep intestine condoms are just as good<br />\nas latex ones.<br />\n12. If used correctly, condoms work about 70 percent<br />\nof the time.<br />\n13. Condoms are much more effective when lubricated<br />\nwith nonoxyno1-9 products.<br />\n14. Condoms which fit snugly make it difficult to keep<br />\nan erection and decrease the enjoyment of the male's<br />\norgasm.<br />\n15. A few people are allergic to nonoxyno1-9 in products, but most reactions are caused by some other ingredient. Changing brands usually takes care of the<br />\nproblem.<br />\n16. Women must have a partner to experiment with in<br />\norder to learn anything practical about using condoms.<br />\n17. Using extra lubricant with condoms makes them feel<br />\nbetter but will not help with 'rubber burn'.<br />\n18. Condoms should not be stored in places where they<br />\nare subjected to a lot of temperature fluctuations.<br />\n19. There are many ways to use condoms for healthy<br />\nsex in addition to their usual role as a penis sheath.<br />\n20. Putting a little corn starch inside unlubricated condoms increases sensation and helps prevent rubber burn.<br />\nResults: Well, there were enough entries to last week's<br />\nMonopoly quiz to accurately vote upon it, so in the interest of keeping space short to accommodate the condom quiz (submitted from outside, I remind you), the<br />\nwinner of last week's quiz was R.S.\"Get Out Of Jail<br />\nFree\" Lowen.

Money stemming from<br />\nsources such as the Maryland<br />\nState Aid and federal grants is increasingly low, \"the lowest<br />\nMaryland has seen in a couple of<br />\ndecades,\" Richardson stated. The<br />\nschool is seeking funds to replace<br />\nthis loss.<br />\nPresident Richardson discussed how the various divisions<br />\nof the University are handling the<br />\nconsequential decreases in their<br />\nbudgets. The School fo Arts and<br />\nSciences, in particular, has been<br />\nsignificantly affected. The<br />\nUniversity has responded by<br />\nswitching various faculty positions so as to minimize the stress<br />\nplaced on certain departments.<br />\nRichardson later commented that<br />\nthis is not a random process, that<br />\nthe Academic Council has<br />\nreviewed all the departments very<br />\nmeticulously. He also noted that<br /><br />\nthe faculty as a whole will not be<br />\nreduced, with the exception of<br />\nnatural attrition caused by<br />\nretirements that are not replaced.<br />\nRichardson also commented on<br />\nthe success the administration has<br />\nhad with extending the Nan-jing<br />\nSchool in China for another 5<br />\nyears; however, funding for more<br />\nyears is still needed. Michelle<br />\nWolf suggested that she was leery<br />\nthat the school continue to provide these programs that initially led to the Five-Year Plan. She<br />\ndoes not want to see the school<br />\nregress in any financial improvements it has made by attempting to retain these programs. The President responded<br />\nby stating that this would not happen again. \"If we do not find the<br />\nfunds to run them, then we<br />\nshouldn't,\" he said.<br />\nAccelerating the planning process for better student facilities<br />\nwas another issue that President<br />\nRichardson discussed.

Phi Mu<br />\nhas been offered the soon-to-be vacant Rogers House as a<br />\nmeeting/living/program space. With space at a premium, funding for extras non-existent, and the climate for student life<br />\nan eternally vexing problem, this move once again raises questions about administrative priorities when it comes to student<br />\nissues.<br />\nWhy was Phi Mu offered Rogers House, especially \"under<br />\nthe table,\" as it were, with no public discussion? This question echoes both within Hopkins Greek circles and without.<br />\nOther sororities understandably ask why they were not consulted. While Hopkins is small enough that word of mouth<br />\nsometimes seems more than sufficient, professionalism and<br />\ncourtesy are not unreasonable requests when a valuable commodity is involved and a specific group of students stands to<br />\nbenefit (or lose). Those involved may have felt that they were<br />\nsimply facilitating the most sensible and feasible action, but<br />\nthat attitude merely reinforces power structures already in place<br />\nand stands in the way of individual students working for change.<br />\nThe next obvious question addresses the blatant omission of<br />\nfraternities from consideration. Director of Housing Carol Mohr<br />\ncited different \"behavior expectations\" as the reason for the<br />\nHousing Office's preference that a sorority occupy Rogers<br />\nrather than a fraternity. Does that mean that Phi Mu holds its<br />\nmembers to higher behavior standards, and that Phi Mu is<br />\ntherefore a more appealing candidate for the space? Or does<br />\nthe administration hold sororities to higher standards of<br />\nbehavior? Though some may plead \"common sense\" in this<br />\ninstance, what does that imply? That the administration gave<br />\nthe question thoughtful, objective consideration and came to<br />\nthe conclusion that girls are cleaner, quieter, and easier to<br />\ncontrol\u2014much more desirable as tenants than those nasty frat<br />\nboys?<br />\nThe non-Greek options that received absolutely no attention,<br />\nat least that we know of, are even more disconcerting. Hopkins<br />\nis notorious for its extra-curricular gaps and its ever-present<br />\nhuman climate failings. Rogers House has the potential to fill<br />\na gap in an area not already addressed within the student activity structure. Greeks already offer community living opportunities. How about an Arts House, a Music House, or an International Students House?<br />\nFor too long the administration has relied on the Greek system<br />\nto provide the few social events that exist for undergraduates<br />\nbeyond the dorm structure, which currently serves only<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nThe Miranda Act<br />\nDouglass Barre<br /><br />\nEpisode Thirteen:<br />\nRaisins and Dates<br />\nMonday nights were special to A three goyim Hannukkah.

Students uncomfortable with the beer-brawl atmosphere and sexual harrassment that can be an integral part<br />\nof the fraternity party scene voice concern and, when met with<br />\nblank administrative stares, take matters into their own hands.<br />\nSeveral new HOP events and Funk Night at the Grad Club(now<br />\ngone, as a result of unrelated administrative restrictions) were<br />\njust a few of the positive results. Yet when an opportunity arises<br />\nfor the administration to match students' efforts with a little<br />\nof its own initiative, a Greek organization is foremost in the<br />\nminds of those who decide.<br />\nIronically, this issue has arisen at the same time that the mandatory sophomore housing was initiated as formal policy by<br />\nthe Homewood Deans. Opposition to mandatory housing has<br />\nreceived little attention, but there are several reasonable<br />\narguments against requiring that sophomores live in Wolman.<br />\nIt is commendable that the administration has taken steps toward<br />\noffering attractive, affordable community living options for<br />\nupper-classmen. This single step could prove to be a giant stride<br />\ntoward alleviating student life problems.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that the administration lacks confidence in<br />\nits product to such an extent that it must require students to<br />\nlive there in order to insure \"success.\" Why not try recommended sophomore, junior, and senior housing, and let individuals decide for themselves?<br />\nThe only exemption from mandatory housing that has received definitive support from the administration is for students who<br />\nwish to live in a Greek house. This formalizes a structure that<br />\nquite unfortunately has been implicitly reinforced for many<br />\nyears\u2014the Greeks offer the only sanctioned alternatives, first<br />\nfor social events, now for housing.<br />\nRenovations to Wolman Hall and the subsequent availability of Rogers House presented the administration with an opportunity to make an innovative addition to the Hopkins community. University-owned space such as Rogers lends itself to<br />\nmany uses, the breadth of which remain unknown because the<br />\ndialogue that would bring to light the ideas and current needs<br />\nof the student body has yet to take place.<br />\nInstead, the administration chose the easy solution. Phi Mu<br />\nis well-established on campus and has the financial stability of<br />\na national organization behind it. Offering the house to Phi Mu<br />\neliminated messy details and pre-empted a potentially complicated (and revealing) dialogue. The administration has once<br />\nagain dispelled hopes that, buried beneath a well-earned reputation resulting from years of neglect, someone genuinely cares<br />\nabout and seeks creative solutions to insidious weaknesses in<br />\nthe quality of student life at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nA Salute to the Hopkins Antiwar Movement, Circa Vietnam; A Raspberry<br />\nto Newl-Letter(?) Coverage of the Current Movement; Kappa Sig Rebuts<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs a senior history major who has<br />\nwritten a paper on Hopkins and Vietnam War and is currently writing a<br />\nthesis on the antiwar movement in<br />\nBaltimore, I feel compelled to respond to Harry Milling's comments<br />\non Vietnam era activism at Johns<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nMilling quotes Professor Doris<br />\nEntwisle as saying the movement at<br />\nHopkins was not especially organized or as severe as at other schools.<br />\nCertainly, the level of visible activism and the use of violence at<br />\nHopkins was extremely low. As Lincoln Gordon, the President of the<br />\nUniversity during the 1960's, was<br />\nfond of saying, no injuries or<br />\ndamage to property occurred at<br />\nHopkins during the war.<br />\nNevertheless, to say that activism<br />\nand the war did not significantly affect Hopkins is wrong. Several facts<br />\nare important here. First, Hopkins<br />\nactivists, while small in number,<br />\nestablished one of the first chapters<br />\nof Students for a Democratic<br />\nSociety in 1961 and remained active<br />\nthroughout the debacle.<br />\nSecond, Hopkins students, faculty, and especially the former<br />\nChaplain, Chester Wickwire, played<br />\nand important role in the city antiwar<br />\nmovement. Numerous meetings of<br />\nvarious campus and city-wide antiwar groups were held in Levering<br />\nHall under the auspices of the<br />\nChaplain.<br />\nThird, by 1970 radicalism and major student unrest had come to<br />\nHopkins. During the course of April<br />\nand May,students organized a strike<br />\nof classes in protest of the presence<br />\nof military recruiters on campus. A<br />\nstudent referendum against<br />\nrecruiters was passed with over 80<br />\npercent of students participating.<br />\nFourth, a group of students and<br />\nsupportive faculty entered an<br />\nAcademic Council meeting without<br />\npermission in May, 1970. After a<br />\nhearing, they were subsequently<br />\nsuspended for the summer session.<br />\nFifth, administrators, including<br />\nclose aides to President Gordon,<br />\nwere concerned with student activism and spent a significant amount<br />\nof their time investigating possible<br />\nunrest.<br />\nSixth, many of the issues affecting<br />\nstudents in the late 1960's and early<br />\n1970's were not related to the war.<br />\nAt Hopkins, students were concered<br />\nwith governance issues, coeducation, dorm life regulations, minority issues, and the state of the<br />\ncurriculum.<br /><br />\nIt is a mistake to overlook the importance of campus issues and only<br />\nfocus on the war because all of these<br />\nissues and movements were intimatley related. In sum, Hopkins<br />\nwas not Columbia or Cornell, but it<br />\nwas not devoid of activism either. In<br />\nan age where scholarship is beginning to examine secondary cities and<br />\ncolleges which may not have received widespread media attention,<br />\nit is important that we not overlook<br />\nthe fact that the antiwar movement<br />\nwas truly national and that Johns<br />\nHopkins and Baltimore played roles<br />\nin the struggle against the Vietnam<br />\nWar.<br />\nJonathan Roberts<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was happy to see so much<br />\ncoverage of the war and how it affects this community in last week's<br />\nissue of the News-Gazette. However,<br />\nI was shocked at the reporting in the<br />\narticle entitled \"Hopkins Students,<br />\nAlums in Gulf.\" When Kathleen<br />\nCurry says, in her second sentence,<br />\n\"Thousands of demonstrators, both<br />\nsupporting and opposing U.S. intervention in the Middle East have<br />\ncongregated in Washington, D.C.<br />\nduring the past two weeks.. .\"she<br />\nis painting a false and terribly<br />\nmisleading picture.<br />\nI went to Washington on January<br />\n19 and 26, to both of the demonstrations Ms. Curry refers to. On<br />\nJanuary 19, there were 25,000 protesters against the war in the Persian<br />\nGulf; by generous estimates there<br />\nwere 100 supporters of the war. On<br />\nJanuary 26, there were at least<br />\n75,000 protesters of the war and<br />\neven fewer than 100 supporters.<br />\nThese are D.C. police estimates, the<br />\nmost conservative ones I could cite<br />\n(the organizers of the January 26<br /><br />\nprotest for peace numbered the protesters at more than 200,000).<br />\nIs there any objective truth in<br />\ndescribing these two Saturday proof<br />\n\"thousands<br />\nas<br />\ntests<br />\ndemonstrators, both supporting and<br />\nopposing U.S. intervention . . .\"?<br />\nPut together, more than 100,000<br />\nvoices gathered in Washington to express their opposition to the war in<br />\nthe Persian Gulf. There was a handful of supporters.<br />\nI am dismayed to see an independent newspaper, a student<br />\nnewspaper, imitate the very worst of<br />\nthe mass media in its coverage of the<br />\nwar. If the News-Gazette wants to<br />\ndeclare its stand on the war, that's<br />\nfine. But when you publish a news<br />\narticle, you have an obligation as<br />\njournalists to present the facts<br />\nobjectively.<br />\nMary Shaffer<br />\nEds'note: We assume that the NewsLetter is the publication in question,<br />\nas we are unfamiliar with the NewsGazette. It is heartening to see an individual so unfamiliar with our<br />\npublication still willing to express<br />\ncriticism.<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs proud members of Kappa<br />\nSigma, we were disturbed by Ms.<br />\nBrooke Gallagher's letter to the<br />\nEditor of 1/31/91. In describing one<br />\nparticular incident, which was done<br />\nto her by an Alpha Tao Omega, and<br />\nonly Alpha Tao Omega, she labeled<br />\nall Greeks as immature buffoons,<br />\nwho only band together in order to<br />\npromote and perpetuate sexism,<br />\nracism, and misogyny. By doing<br />\nthis, she implied that all other fraternities, including Kappa Sigma, are<br />\nguilty of these crimes.

For this we are deeply<br />\noffended.<br />\nWe are no Alpha Tao Omega<br />\napologists. We simply want to express that non-Greeks should look<br />\nonly at the offending organization,<br />\nrather than the system to which it<br />\nloosely belongs. Are all AfricanAmericans evil because one AfricanAmerican man commits a crime? If<br />\na Chinese driver cut you off, does<br />\nthis one incident instantly label all<br />\nChinese-Americans as poor drivers?<br />\nIndeed, Ms. Gallagher is<br />\nperpetuating the very same mentality and collective bigotry that she<br />\nherself criticizes. Please do not fall<br />\ninto the ignorant trap of labeling all<br />\nGreeks with some \"-ism,\" because<br />\nyou have a problem with one in<br />\nparticular.<br />\nKeep in mind the many positive<br />\nthings that Hopkins Fraternities do.<br />\nFrom providing housing, to a social<br />\noutlet, to their extensive philanthropic work, Greeks have made<br />\ntheir name contributing to Toys for<br />\nTots, organizing Turkey drives,<br />\ncleaning up neighborhoods and<br />\nparks, sponsoring volleyball tournaments for Baltimore Reads, and<br />\nvolunteering at local hospitals and<br />\nhomeless shelters. And the list goes<br />\non. These activities are not rationalizations for our existence, but<br />\nrather the raison d'etre of the Greek<br />\nsystem.

For the first time<br />\nin the centuries-old tradition of<br />\nwar, a war is being witnessed not<br />\nonly by the battlefield commanders in country, but by<br />\nAmericans<br />\nand<br />\nIraqis<br />\nsimultaneously, as it happens (or<br />\nlive if you prefer). What a<br />\nfascinating concept: to hear and<br />\nsee the bombs bursting in air<br />\nfrom the comfort of your own<br />\nhome.<br />\nCertainly the very face of battle has changed. The public<br />\neagerly consumes any information that is doled out by the<br />\nmedia, or the military and its<br />\nand<br />\nIraqi<br />\ncensors\u2014both<br />\nAmerican. Yet many times the<br />\nmedia reports a breaking story<br />\nonly to find out later that it is untrue or partially true. Similarly,<br />\nPentagon and Department of<br />\nDefense officials have been accused of repressing potentially<br />\nembarrassing news stories or<br />\nmilitary information for several<br />\ndays. When the flood of information from the war is not only<br />\noverwhelming but contradictory,<br />\nerroneous conclusions are inevitable. A few statements caught<br />\nmy eye, though, so I've compiled my very own \"Top 10 List<br />\nof Gulf Follies.\"<br />\n10. Iraq had no legitimate<br />\ngrievances or claims against<br />\nKuwait. Through a process<br />\nknown as \"slant drilling,\"<br />\nKuwait was widely suspected of<br />\ntaking more than its share of oil<br />\nfrom the Rumalia oil fields on its<br />\nborder with Iraq. As in many<br />\ncountries in the Middle East, Iraq<br />\nstill seethes over border lines that<br />\nwere drawn by foreigners, namely the British.<br />\n9. Saddam Hussein wasfoolish<br />\nto invade Kuwait. Our wonderful State Department had told<br />\nHussein less than a month before<br />\nthe invasion that the U.S. had<br />\n\"no opinion\" about border<br />\ndisputes. Hussein's army is so<br />\nlarge that many military experts<br />\nfelt he had to use it or lose it.<br />\nWith the $2 billion infusion of<br />\ncash and riches pilfered from<br />\nKuwait, it was a sweet deal.<br />\n8. The Arabs in the allied coalition won'tfight. While President<br />\nBush obviously had political aims<br />\nin mind, the coalition that he<br />\nassembled is a formidable one.<br />\nGround troops and armored divisions from Egypt and Syria, Tornado jets from Britian, and<br />\ncountless other nations' ships in<br />\nthe Gulf all play critical military<br />\nroles. Saudis, Kuwaits, and<br />\nQuataris have already displayed<br />\ntheir military might in Khalil'.<br />\n7. The coalition will splinter if<br />\nIsrael counter-attacks. For<br /><br />\nYitzhak Shamir.<br />\n5. The United States wants to<br />\ndemolish Iraq's military.<br />\nChemical, biological, and nuclear<br />\nweapons in Iraq were clearly<br />\nU.S. military targets since August<br />\n2. If Iraq's army is reduced to<br />\nsmithereens, its two neighbors,<br />\nIran and Syria, could move in to<br />\nset up shop, possibly partitioning<br />\nIraq. Yet if Iraq is simply beaten<br />\nback from Kuwait with missiles,<br />\nchemicals, high-tech planes, and<br />\nits leader still intact, would the<br />\nU.S. declare victory? The<br />\nmilitary is actively seeking a<br />\nbalance\u2014a very fine line\u2014<br />\nbetween Iraq's destruction and its<br />\ncapitulation. Nothing less than the<br />\nstability of the Middle East is at<br />\nstake.<br />\n4. Air power can pound Saddam into submission. If you<br />\nhaven't heard yet, we're pounding and Saddam isn't submitting. Even if the Iraqis surrendered en masse, we'd have to<br />\n\"mop up.\" Most military planners in the U.S. never really<br />\nbelieved air power could knock<br /><br />\noi<br />\n,\u2022 ON ,fl<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nTr'S So ... `)0 B.F.:AK(<br /><br />\nLr<br /><br />\nr is 4)35)10r.-ay 8,4 .gw<br /><br />\nMOCi-1.)<br /><br />\nf NEED A PURPOSE!<br /><br />\n6 DIRELTION!<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n(I 11111 )1 11<br /><br />\n\"///<br /><br />\nPer Jambeck<br />\nSaddam out by itself. The dammage wrought by the U.S. is<br />\nsignificant, but Hussein has dug<br />\nin his tanks, communications<br />\nlines, and troops are largely<br />\nprotected.<br />\n3. American protesters are hurting our troop morale. Most, if<br />\nnot all, protests are aimed at<br /><br />\nTen myths about<br />\nabout the War in<br />\nthe Gulf...<br /><br />\npoliticians: Congress and the<br />\nPresident, or the Pentagon itself.<br />\nProtesters question the motives of<br /><br />\nthe war, not the integrity of<br />\nPrivate Joe Smith. On the contrary, wives, husbands, and<br /><br />\nchildren are rallying around the<br />\nflag in support of their spouses,<br />\nfathers, and mothers in country.<br />\nAbove all, the U.S. is a<br />\ndemocracy that tolerates protests,<br />\nboth sincere and ludicrous, in<br />\nrespect to free speech.<br />\n2. Saddam Hussein is a madman. Well, there is only one man<br />\nwho has been likened to Adolf<br />\nHitler, has gassed his own people, and who regularly executes<br />\nhis own officers. Yet Hussein is<br />\nby no means mad: he is clever,<br />\npowerful, and above all, ambitious. Since he can't quit<br />\nKuwait(prelude to a coup) he has<br />\ndug in his troops. Side attractions<br />\nhave included lobbing missiles at<br />\nIsrael (killing innocent civilians),<br />\npouring hundreds of millions of<br />\ngallons of oil into the Gulf<br />\n(wreaking ecological havoc), and<br />\ntransferring 95 or so planes to<br /><br />\nIran, his former arch-enemy.<br /><br />\nWhen analyzed, his intentions are<br />\nlogical. His actions would, if successful, create and Arab-Israeli<br />\nwar; parch the allies' throats due<br />\nto a lack of drinking water; and<br />\ndraw Iran into the conflict,<br />\n\u2022<br />\nrespectively.<br />\nAnd now, you've guessed it,<br />\nthe number one Gulf folly:<br />\nI. The ground war will be long<br /><br />\nand bloody. I don't need mention<br />\nthat I'm cashing in my chips on<br />\nthis one. From the very beginning of the November 8 buildup\u2014<br />\nannounced conveniently two days<br />\nafter U.S. elections\u2014Bush knew<br />\nthat the American public could<br />\nnot stand a ground war leading to<br />\ntens of thousands of U.S.<br />\ncasualties. After softening up Iraq<br />\ntroops from the air, Bush need<br />\nonly achieve one of two objectives: cut off the Iraqi army's<br />\nfood or its water.<br />\nFirst, the U.S. may attempt to<br /><br />\nliterally stop the flow of supplies<br />\ninto Kuwait. Trucks bearing<br />\nfood, ammunition, fuel, and<br />\nspare parts are constantly streaming into Kuwait, at the rate of<br />\nhundreds, or even thousands, of<br />\ntrucks each day. Squadrons of<br />\nB-52's have bombed bridges,<br />\nhighways, depots, and truck con-<br /><br />\n...and a look<br />\nat the logic<br />\nbehind them<br /><br />\nvoys. Some American planners<br />\nboast they can cut supplies to<br />\nKuwait to as little as 1/10th of<br />\nwhat would normally be needed<br />\nto sustain such an enormous occontinued on page 7<br /><br />\nree<br />\neecii<br /><br />\nseveral months, the U.S. has<br />\nbeen lobbying Syria, Jordan, and<br />\neven Iran to show restraint if<br />\nIsrael should become involved.<br />\nSince Israel did not execute a preemptive strike against Iraq, the<br />\nU.S. is fairly confident that any<br />\nIsraeli involvement would do<br />\nminimal damage to the coalition.<br />\n6. Israel stands to gainfrom the<br />\nwar.

People have given<br />\nmany reasons for \"why we must<br />\ngo to war.\" In my opinion, the<br />\npossible outcomes of this war<br />\nhave not been considered. Iraq<br />\nmay end up defeated and disarmed, which from our viewpoint<br />\ncan't be bad. But there are other<br />\nfactors at play. War is a simplistic<br />\nsolution to a more complex problem. Here are the outcomes<br />\nabout which one only hears lip<br />\nservice on CNN:<br />\n1. Destabilization of regional<br />\nregimes. Dr. Ashraf Ghani and<br />\nother have discussed the convulsions which could result from the<br />\nwar through much of the Middle<br />\nEast\u2014in Jordan, Egypt, and<br />\nelsewhere. Such revolutions may<br />\ntopple hoary monarchies, but<br />\nthey may also install more<br />\nnationalistic dictators like Saddam<br />\nHussein.<br />\n2. Disruption of lasting peace<br />\nin the Middle East. Israel,<br />\nunderstandably, will become<br />\nmore reluctant to have a Palestinian state on its border. Countries<br />\nlike Syria, Iran, and Libya may<br />\nemerge to occupy the power vacuum created by Iraq's defeat,<br />\nand none of them are known for<br />\ntheir peacefulness or human<br />\nrights record. The Lebanese civil<br />\nwar, fueled by increased factionalism, may intensify. This is<br />\na formula for more war, not for<br />\npeace, setting back possibilities<br />\nfor disarmament of chemical and<br />\nnuclear weapons, an arms agreement which foreign policy experts consider \"essential.\"<br />\n3. Exacerbation of economic<br />\ntensions. If Kuwait's oil-wealthy<br /><br />\ntrk<br />\n1%<br /><br />\n111111t11<br />\n..,111in<br /><br />\nemir is restored to power, the old<br />\nregional tensions will be worse<br />\nthan ever. \"Liberated\" Kuwait<br />\nmay return to the monarchy it<br />\nwas before. Under the emir's<br />\nrule, it had merely nominal<br />\ndemocracy, gave no rights for<br />\nforeign workers, and showed a<br />\ntendency to invest its wealth in<br />\nWestern real estate rather than in<br />\nits Arab neighbors. Already existing anti-Western sentiment<br />\namong Arabs will not be aided by<br />\nthe U.S. returning the emir to<br />\npower.<br />\n4. Widening ofthe 'credibility<br />\ngap.'Many people are wondering why the U.S. has singled out<br />\nIraq for this treatment, having ignored expansionism on the part<br />\nof South Africa, murdering of<br />\ncitizens by China, brutal suppression by the Soviet Union, and<br />\nhuman rights violations in<br />\nGuatemala, among countless<br />\nother nations with records of<br />\nsimilar behavior. We are not at<br />\nwar with any of these other<br />\ncountries, suggesting that the key<br /><br />\nIraq, with our access to foreign<br />\noil being assured again, complacent America suddenly will forget<br />\nall this talk about conservation<br />\nand alternative energy, just as it<br />\ndid after the Arab embargoes of<br />\nthe 1970's. It will go back to using oil, a limited fossil fuel that<br />\nincreases global warming and<br />\npollutes our beaches, rather than<br />\ndeveloping a consistent energy<br />\npolicy.<br />\n6. Future Iraqi threat. A<br />\ndefeated Iraq will not give up the<br />\nidea that Kuwait historically<br />\nbelongs to them. A cunning new<br />\nleader, perhaps one of Saddam's<br /><br />\nof the Cold War, new alliances<br />\nare being formed. Many analysts<br />\nsee a new era of tension betweeen<br />\nthe nations of the industrialized<br />\nNorth (the U.S., Soviets, etc.)<br />\nand the underdeveloped South<br />\n(the Middle East, Africa, Latin<br />\nAmerica, and other Third World<br />\nnations.) This conflict can only<br />\nincrease such tensions. A new<br /><br />\nA defeated Iraq will not give up the idea that Kuwait<br />\nhistorically belongs to them. A cunning new leader, perhaps one<br />\nof Hussein's lieutenants, may come back to fan the flames<br />\nof revenge and resentment against the West.<br />\nfactor in this conflict is oil. The<br />\nmoral ground of the U.S. as International Policeman will be<br />\nundermined even more. Possibly,<br />\nthe U.S. may be seen as a 'Hessian' state selling out its military<br />\nprowess to the highest bidder.<br />\n5. Problems at home. A<br />\ndeepening recession, combined<br />\nwith a banking system in trouble,<br />\nand a war economy (even with<br />\nheavy subsidies coming from our<br />\nforeign bankrollers), can only be<br />\na recipe for disaster. If we defeat<br /><br />\nlieutenants, may come back to fan<br />\nthe flames of revenge and resentment against the West.(One such<br />\nleader in 1930's Europe was<br />\nAdolf Hitler, whose name has appeared in so many far-fetched<br />\nanalogies already.) The alternative to this situation is continued military occupation, which<br />\nmay create more problems than<br />\nit solves.<br />\n7. The new NATO: North versus South? With East-West tensions dying down due to the end<br /><br />\narms race will mean the so-called<br />\n'peace dividend' will be spent and<br />\nthe games of military escalation<br />\nwill begin.<br />\n8. Environmental obliteration.<br />\nOil fields in the area may burn<br />\n\"for up to months\" says one<br />\nmilitary expert. This would<br />\nrelease vast amounts of pollution.<br />\nAttacks on ships and refineries<br />\nmay spill more oil to add to the<br />\noil Saddam is already dumping<br />\ninto t he sea. Bombing of nuclear,<br />\nbiological, and chemical facilities<br /><br />\nmay release vast amounts of toxin into neighboring areas and not<br />\njust Iraq. Craters and unexploded shells may mar the desert<br />\necology of the region for a long<br />\ntime. Archaeological sites, part of<br />\nIraq's cultural environment, may<br />\nalso be levelled.<br />\nSince continuing the war is not<br />\na feasible option, we must consider ways to end it. The first important thing is to declare a ceasefire. Next there should be a rotation out of U.S. military troops,<br />\nto be replaced by U.N. multinational forces. Following that<br />\nshould be negotiations involving<br />\nthe following demands on Iraq:<br />\nmandatory disarmament of<br />\ngenocidal weapons; phased<br />\nwithdrawal from Kuwait; release<br />\nof all hostages and POW's. Sanctions should be stepped up to to<br />\nassure compliance. Discussion of<br />\nother matters, such as the Palestinians and disputed oil fields,<br />\nwould follow after these preconditions are met. War crimes trials<br />\nfor Hussein can and should be<br />\nconsidered, but the people of Iraq<br />\ndo not deserve to pay for his<br />\nmindless hatred through excessive reparations.<br /><br />\nSecond<br />\nThought<br />\nContinued from page 5<br />\ncupying force.<br />\nSecond, and most important, is<br />\nwater.

His detailed review, as well as that of Paul<br />\nKramer, only highlight the flippancy of reviewer Dave Edelman. Mr.<br />\nEdelman, given the fourplays and<br />\nthree monologues produced in this<br />\nyear's Theatre Lab, finds only<br />\nenough criticism to fill three columns, equal to that which Mr.<br />\nKramer devotes to one film.<br />\nMoreover, Mr. Edelman's appraisals of each show seem inadequate. He writes, for instance, that<br />\nunderstudy Julia Ro delivered a<br />\nstellar performance of Rebecca Garron's monologue \"Deconstruction\".<br />\nI am in perfect agreement with him.<br />\nHowever, he continues: \"Garron<br />\nherself would not have done a better one [performance]\"; and yet, he<br />\nnever once saw Garron perform the<br />\nmonologue.<br />\nMr. Edelman reveals also a<br />\nmisunderstanding of his topic as concerns Michelle Clay's performance<br />\nin Seven Ways to Jack. He writes<br />\nthat Ms. Clay's role was far easier<br />\nthan that of Joshua Coleman,<br />\nbecause she had no dialogue. Those<br />\nof us in the audience could see that<br />\nher performance as an autistic<br /><br />\nwoman was no easy feat; she not only created a character for herself, but<br />\nwas crucial to the development of<br />\nMr. Coleman's angry and frustrated<br />\nJack.<br />\nI agree with many of Mr.<br />\nEdelman's criticisms, namely those<br />\nconcerning The Party, in which I<br />\nperformed. As a performer,<br />\nhowever, I am sensitive to Mr.<br />\nEdelman's abrupt treatment of nearly all issues and themes of the plays.<br />\nIf Arturo Interian's Homestead Shuffle followed a formula, what was it<br />\nand where did it come from? If Ms.<br />\nGarron's \"Deconstruction\" has<br />\nbeen done before, then where? How<br />\nwas Jessica Matthewson's The Party technically sloppy? And why no<br />\nmention of the significance of the<br />\nGoucher Students to the production?<br />\nAs a point of information to Mr.<br />\nEdelman, two of the plays, Seven<br />\nWays to Jack and The Party, were<br />\nwritten by Goucher students. Much<br />\nof the acting and nearly all of the<br />\ntechnical production was completed<br />\nby Goucher. Yet, there was no mention of their contribution.<br />\nI repeat that I respect Mr.<br />\nEdelman's point of view concerning<br />\nhis criticisms. I believe, however,<br />\nthat his review is uninformed,<br />\nuninspired, inadequate and terse in<br /><br />\nKathy Korbuly<br /><br />\nnature. A production as creative and<br />\ncomplex as Theatre Lab merits competent analysis and valid criticisms.<br />\nI would sooner have Mr. Edelman<br />\nattend future events for the sake of<br />\nenjoying the theatre and not for the<br />\nsake of a half-hearted review.<br />\nBrooke A. Ettle<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nAs the much-maligned reviewer of<br />\nthe Barnstormers' \"Throat<br />\nCulture,\" I would like to offer an<br />\napology not only to Rebecca Garron,<br />\nbut to the rest of the cast as well.<br />\nThe decision to delay the review<br />\nof \"Throat Culture\" until after its<br />\nclosing weekend was not an editorial<br />\none, but rather a consequence of the<br />\nStaff Writer Time Conflict Syndrome. As Ms. Garron is undoubtedly aware, this rampant<br />\ndisease has also taken its toll upon<br />\nthe \"Theatre Lab,\" to my regrets.<br />\nAs for the allegations of sexism in<br />\nthe language of my review, another<br />\napology is in order. I certainly had<br />\nno such intentions by labelling Garron a \"female cast member\" or<br />\npraising her ability to \"keep up with<br />\nthe fast pace of the show.\" There are<br />\nonly so many ways to say \"good actress\" in English; the ramifications<br />\nof this particular one had not occur-<br /><br />\nt) \\<br /><br />\nWICATioN SociA1izik6<br />\nred to me.<br />\nI stand by my reading of<br />\nthe' 2001\" skit as valid.<br />\nA final note: the \"Theatre Lab\"<br />\nseveral<br />\narticle<br />\ncontained<br />\ntypographical errors, the most glaring of which occurred in the review<br />\nof Ms. Garron's skit.

The verbal<br />\ncomprehension sections will ask<br />\nquestions based on reading<br />\npassages (of approximately 500<br />\nwords) drawn from the<br />\nhumanities, sciences, and social<br />\nsciences. Meanwhile, the<br />\nphysical sciences section will<br /><br />\nconsist of questions from physics<br />\nand general chemistry. Furthermore, the biological sciences section will have questions from<br />\nbiology and organic chemistry.<br />\nThe written section will consist of<br />\ntwo essays that will test the student's ability to write logically,<br />\ncoherently, and thoughtfully on a<br />\ngeneral topic.<br />\nWith the previous MCAT,the<br />\nwriting sample was not graded,<br />\nbut now the essay will be assigned a grade from J-T(T being the<br />\nhighest). The new format has<br />\nomitted two previous sections:<br />\nscience and quantitative problems. The basic science questions requiring memorization will<br /><br />\nremain the same. The new format<br />\nwill reduce the test time by one<br />\nhour. \"The shorter test time will<br />\nmake the MCATs more<br />\nhumane,\" says Dr. John Gryder,<br />\npremedical advisor at Hopkins.<br />\nGryder believes that whether<br />\nthe new MCAT will be easier<br />\nthan the old format really depends<br />\non the individual. Students who<br />\npossess reading and writing skills<br />\nwill have an advantage over those<br />\nwho do well on rote memorization. \"The English requirement<br />\nfor getting admission to medical<br />\nschool should not be taken lightly as before,\" added Gryder.<br />\nAs to why the MCAT has<br />\nchanged, Leslie Sporn, ad-<br /><br />\nThe NEW 1991 MCAT<br />\n85 minutes<br /><br />\n65 Questions<br /><br />\nVerbal Reasoning<br /><br />\nA.<br /><br />\n100 minutes<br /><br />\n77 Questions<br /><br />\nPhysical Sciences<br /><br />\nB.<br /><br />\n10 minutes<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n,<br />\n60 minutes<br /><br />\nlunch<br /><br />\n60 minutes<br /><br />\n2 Essays<br /><br />\nWriting Sample<br /><br />\nC.<br />\n,<br /><br />\n10 minutes<br /><br />\nbreak<br />\nI).<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nBiological Sciences<br /><br />\nStudents who<br />\npossess<br />\nreading and<br />\nwriting skills<br />\nwill have an<br />\nadvantage...<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\n\u2014<br />\nbreak<br /><br />\nministrator at Kaplan Education,<br />\nwhich gives prepartory courses to<br />\nhundreds of students every year<br />\nsays that medical schools wanted<br />\nthe change. \"Medical schools are<br />\nseeking physicians with a broad<br />\nfocus and communications<br />\nskills,\" said Sporn.

By using DNA<br />\npolymorphisms (differences in<br />\nDNA) obtained from both<br />\nparents, their studies have shown<br />\nthat 95 percent of all cases of the<br />\ndisorder are due to maternal errors of meiosis.<br />\n\"By looking at families with<br />\nthe disorder, we can see why<br />\nmeiosis goes wrong and<br />\nchromosome 21 is passed on as<br />\nan inherited trait,\" explains Dr.<br />\nAndrew Warren, researcher at<br />\nthe Medical Center. \"The map of<br />\nchromosome 21 is very detailed<br />\nfor such a small chromosome,<br />\nand through genetic markers we<br /><br />\nare trying make a complete<br />\ngenetic map that would explain<br />\nthe<br />\netiology<br />\nof Down<br />\nSyndrome.\"<br />\nDown Syndrome, the most<br />\ncommon genetic cause of mental<br />\nretardation, is a chromosomal<br />\nanomaly. Affected individuals<br />\nhave 47 chromosomes instead of<br />\nthe normal 46. This irreversible<br />\ncondition, characterized by slow<br />\nphysical development and flattish<br />\nskull and facial features, is commonly referred as trisomy 21.<br />\nPast chromosomal studies have<br />\nshown<br />\nthat<br />\nthis<br />\nextra<br />\nchromosome 21 is the result of<br />\nnondisjunction<br />\nwhere<br />\nhomologous chromosomes fail to<br />\nseparate during the anaphase<br />\nstage of cell division either on the<br />\nfirst or second meiotic division.<br />\nAbout 95 percent of all Down<br /><br />\nSyndrome cases are due to 3<br />\ncomplete copies (trisomy) of<br />\nchromosome 21, which is the<br />\nsmallest chromosome found in<br />\nman's genome. \"The extra<br />\nchromosome is due to reduced<br />\nrecombination, because recombination of chromosomes is important for correct meiosis to occur.\" explains Warren, \"and in<br />\nmany species recombination is<br />\nneccessary for orderly disjunction<br />\nto occur. No recombination<br />\nresults in increased frequencies on<br />\nnondisjunction tor reasons no one<br />\nknows.\"<br />\nShortly after the discovery of<br />\ntrisomy 21, genetic studies<br />\ndemonstrated that not all cases of<br />\nDown Syndrome are due to an<br />\nextra copy of chromosome 21.<br />\nAlthough occurring at lower frequencies (of about 2-3 percent),<br /><br />\nDown's is also caused by<br />\nreciprocal translocation between<br />\ntwo chromosomal groups in<br />\nwhich a small part of<br />\nchromosome 21 is fused to<br />\nanother chromosome of another<br />\ngroup which interestingly, results<br />\nin trisomy 21.<br />\nPresently it is unknown why<br />\ntranslocation results in Down<br />\nSyndrome. However, geneticists<br />\nhave found this to be very important in determining which genes<br />\non chromosomes 21 are responsible for causing the disorder.<br />\n\"By looking at chromosomes of<br />\npeople with partial trisomy where<br />\nthere is a tiny bit of extra<br />\nchromosome 21,\" explains Warren, \"and from this we are trying to find the part that is needed<br />\nto inherit Down's minimal<br />\nphenotypes.\" Warren continued<br /><br />\nby saying,\"We are currently trying to find more markers in that<br />\nregion by tracking more genes<br />\nthrough DNA polymorphisms.\"<br />\nThe old method of identifying<br />\nthe origin of the extra<br />\nchromosome was subjective;<br />\ngeneticists looked at the parent's<br />\nchromosomes from under a<br />\nmicroscope (karotyping). From<br />\nthe chormosomal dfferences or<br />\nsimilarities, geneticists determined if the child's extra 21st<br />\nchromosome looked like more of<br />\nthe mother's or the father's. This<br />\nmethod had limited accurracy in<br />\nof<br />\norigin<br />\nlocating<br />\nthe<br />\nnondisjunction.<br />\n\"Using developed DNA<br />\npolymorphisms obtained from<br />\nsouthern blotting is more accurate<br />\nand informative,\" explained Warren. DNA poylmorphisms allow<br /><br />\ngeneticist to look more closely at<br />\nthe DNA that makes up the<br />\nchromosome. \"From the patterns<br />\nof polymorphisms or the differnet<br />\nfragments obtained from restrictive enzymes digest, geneticists<br />\nare able to see the differences that<br />\nare inherited as different genetic<br />\ntraits,\" explained Warren, \"and<br />\nby comparing patterns of the obtained DNA from the father and<br />\nthe mother, we are able to tell<br />\nwhich chromosome 21 are from<br />\nwhich parent.\"<br />\n\"The use of poylmorphisms<br />\nwill help medical researchers<br />\nunderstand what happens to a<br />\nmother's egg when she has a<br />\nchild with Down Syndrome,\"<br />\nsays Stylianos Antonarakis,<br />\nM.D., \"giving us a better<br />\nunderstanding of the mechanisms<br />\nof the disorder.\"<br /><br />\n\u00b0SPRING BREAK 91\"<br />\nCANCUN, MEXICO<br />\nFEATURING THE OASIS CANCUN HOTEL<br />\nSTARTING MARCH 16, 1991<br />\nTHRU MARCH 23, 1991<br /><br />\n235 W.

This match was a<br />\nconference sectional, where 6<br />\nteams from schools all over the<br />\nNortheast came to participate in<br />\na founday shootout. The Hopkins<br />\nteam competed in both the<br />\nsmallbore and air rifle divisions,<br />\nspending the entire day of Saturday on the firing line.<br />\nLast week the team won two air<br />\nrifle matches, placing them ahead<br />\nof Princeton as the leaders of the<br />\nHigh Marksman division. Considering this is such a young<br />\nteam, with two freshmen, three<br />\nsophomores and one senior, it<br />\nlooks like this could be the<br />\nstrongest rifle team Hopkins has<br />\nseen in a long time. The team is<br />\nlooking for additional experienced shooters to add to its<br />\nranks, hoping that increased competition between the teammates<br />\nwill produce even higher scores.<br />\n\"We'd like to see a few women<br />\ntry out,\" says Coach Samuel<br />\nHardy. \"Female shooters have<br />\nphysical advantages over male<br />\nshooters\u2014lower center of gravity, wider hips.
