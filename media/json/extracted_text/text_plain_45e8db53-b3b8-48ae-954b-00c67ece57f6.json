The<br />\nNEWS LETTER is still asking council candidates to publish statements of policy<br />\n(or platforms) in its next and following issues. But<br />\nwe're really getting tired. After all, three years is a<br />\nlong time to push a project, with discouraging results.<br />\nAt any rate, we're willing to keep trying and make<br />\nour facilities available. We hope our campus cleangovernment Zealots still retain sufficient of their earlier<br />\nenthusiasm to support us in making this a worthwhile<br />\nundertaking.<br />\nAnd while we're on politics: An active, and, on the<br />\nwhole, excellent council this year has led many to<br />\nlose sight of the real political morass into which we<br />\nsink steadily deeper. Any ultimate good coming out<br />\nof our student government this year isn't coming because of student interest, but rather despite it! Under<br />\nour present system of stooge voting (sans even election<br />\ncigars), it's pure luck when we get a decent council.<br />\nLuck doesn't hold out forever.<br />\nThere's nothing wrong with politics! That's the<br />\ndemocratic method for choosing and working governments. But dirty, double-crossing, cheap politics is<br />\nnot for us, thank you. As we see it, there must be a<br />\nmethod of knowing what a man intends, voting for<br />\nhim on that basis, and then holding him responsible for<br />\neffecting it.<br />\nPolitical parties might offer a solution. A few weeks<br />\nback, the NEWS-LETTER ran a pre-vote analysis of the<br />\nCouncil. It could be seen therein that our political<br />\nsentiments fall into three categories: Liberal, Conservative, Moderate. This furnishes a good basis for party<br />\nplatforms.<br />\nUnder such a set-up, affiliated men could be gauged<br />\nby votes, and their party held responsible for them.<br />\nIt's a simple scheme, but it works. All we need are a<br />\nfew men who'll start working instead of talking and<br />\ntimes will change.<br />\n<br />\nAgenda<br />\nfor a<br />\npolitical rally<br />\n<br />\nWith a great grunt and a<br />\nshort stretch t h e Barnstormers' new regime announced plans for a second<br />\nshow in May, and proved<br />\nthat there was life in the<br />\nold dog yet. Well, the<br />\n\"Petrified Forest\" is an ambitious venture for this time<br />\nof year, but presumably our Thespians know their<br />\ncapabilities. The campus has received the news gratefully, and if the doubt now+, hovering in the air is<br />\ndispelled, the club will have done much in this one gesture to restore good faith and good will.<br />\nA word of caution, however. There are those among<br />\nthe actors who are prone to regard the club as too<br />\nmuch of an experimental laboratory, with too little regard for those sitting on the other side of the footlights.<br />\nThe first obligation of every activity is to the University,<br />\nnot to its membership. This must be borne in mind.<br />\nThe Barnstormers are a college group and may therefore take certain liberties. But student reaction must<br />\nremain the uppermost consideration.<br />\n<br />\nThe Forest<br />\nand the<br />\ntrees<br />\n<br />\nAmericans may be just<br />\nthe least trifle relieved over<br />\nthe report tendered the F<br />\nB I concerning the Bund's<br />\nactivities. Loud as,foolish<br />\nFritzy may shout, the black<br />\nand white report of a mere<br />\ndubious 25,000 membership is somewhat reassuring.<br />\nHowever, the European scene, even now that Mr<br />\nChamberlain has dropped his umbrella and taken<br />\nto trying to outshout Herr Hitler, remains an enigma<br />\nwaiting for time's solution. Poland and Roumania<br />\nshare the small land's fear of a war on its home<br />\nsoil. Thus, the hesitancy in regard to definite action<br />\nwhich might prove provative.<br />\nYet, the democratic axis must be welded lest it be<br />\nsnapped.

The<br />\nNEWS LETTER is still asking council candidates to publish statements of policy<br />\n(or platforms) in its next and following issues. But<br />\nwe're really getting tired. After all, three years is a<br />\nlong time to push a project, with discouraging results.<br />\nAt any rate, we're willing to keep trying and make<br />\nour facilities available. We hope our campus cleangovernment Zealots still retain sufficient of their earlier<br />\nenthusiasm to support us in making this a worthwhile<br />\nundertaking.<br />\nAnd while we're on politics: An active, and, on the<br />\nwhole, excellent council this year has led many to<br />\nlose sight of the real political morass into which we<br />\nsink steadily deeper. Any ultimate good coming out<br />\nof our student government this year isn't coming because of student interest, but rather despite it! Under<br />\nour present system of stooge voting (sans even election<br />\ncigars), it's pure luck when we get a decent council.<br />\nLuck doesn't hold out forever.<br />\nThere's nothing wrong with politics! That's the<br />\ndemocratic method for choosing and working governments. But dirty, double-crossing, cheap politics is<br />\nnot for us, thank you. As we see it, there must be a<br />\nmethod of knowing what a man intends, voting for<br />\nhim on that basis, and then holding him responsible for<br />\neffecting it.<br />\nPolitical parties might offer a solution. A few weeks<br />\nback, the NEWS-LETTER ran a pre-vote analysis of the<br />\nCouncil. It could be seen therein that our political<br />\nsentiments fall into three categories: Liberal, Conservative, Moderate. This furnishes a good basis for party<br />\nplatforms.<br />\nUnder such a set-up, affiliated men could be gauged<br />\nby votes, and their party held responsible for them.<br />\nIt's a simple scheme, but it works. All we need are a<br />\nfew men who'll start working instead of talking and<br />\ntimes will change.<br /><br />\nAgenda<br />\nfor a<br />\npolitical rally<br /><br />\nWith a great grunt and a<br />\nshort stretch t h e Barnstormers' new regime announced plans for a second<br />\nshow in May, and proved<br />\nthat there was life in the<br />\nold dog yet. Well, the<br />\n\"Petrified Forest\" is an ambitious venture for this time<br />\nof year, but presumably our Thespians know their<br />\ncapabilities. The campus has received the news gratefully, and if the doubt now+, hovering in the air is<br />\ndispelled, the club will have done much in this one gesture to restore good faith and good will.<br />\nA word of caution, however. There are those among<br />\nthe actors who are prone to regard the club as too<br />\nmuch of an experimental laboratory, with too little regard for those sitting on the other side of the footlights.<br />\nThe first obligation of every activity is to the University,<br />\nnot to its membership. This must be borne in mind.<br />\nThe Barnstormers are a college group and may therefore take certain liberties. But student reaction must<br />\nremain the uppermost consideration.<br /><br />\nThe Forest<br />\nand the<br />\ntrees<br /><br />\nAmericans may be just<br />\nthe least trifle relieved over<br />\nthe report tendered the F<br />\nB I concerning the Bund's<br />\nactivities. Loud as,foolish<br />\nFritzy may shout, the black<br />\nand white report of a mere<br />\ndubious 25,000 membership is somewhat reassuring.<br />\nHowever, the European scene, even now that Mr<br />\nChamberlain has dropped his umbrella and taken<br />\nto trying to outshout Herr Hitler, remains an enigma<br />\nwaiting for time's solution. Poland and Roumania<br />\nshare the small land's fear of a war on its home<br />\nsoil. Thus, the hesitancy in regard to definite action<br />\nwhich might prove provative.<br />\nYet, the democratic axis must be welded lest it be<br />\nsnapped. The showdown will tolerate no weakening<br />\nwhich must prove fatal. The small democracies will<br />\nhave to cast their lots with Britain and France. And<br />\nBritain, cautious, hypocritical lion that she is, cannot<br />\nafford to back down at this stage of the game. Hitler<br />\ntalks big and acts accordingly. What will Britain do?<br />\nMeanwhile, too, reports persist that Hitler's American friend, Trufillo, dictator of Santo Domingo, plans<br />\na Haitian coup on April 11, the date set for a national<br />\nreferendum in the island republic. In the Nazi fashion,<br />\nplanned outbreaks are to necessitate stepping in<br />\nto preserve order. Trufillo is said to be planning an<br />\noil agreement with Germany. Nazi naval observations<br />\nin the neighborhood have also been very much in<br />\nevidence of late. German imports to the Dominican<br />\nrepublic rise steadily.<br />\nSanto Domingo is close enough to Puerto Rica, which<br />\nis strategic in regard to the Panama Canal, to make it<br />\nimportant to the United States.
