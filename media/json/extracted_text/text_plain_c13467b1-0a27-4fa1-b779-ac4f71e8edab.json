Orrick, noted consulting engineer, of New York City.<br />\nMr. Orrick, who addressed a<br />\ngroup of engineering upper-classmen last Monday, April 30, on the<br />\nsubject of \"Power Development,<br />\nPast and Future,\" is the director<br />\nand builder of many of the lagest<br />\npower plants in the East during<br />\nthe last quarter of a century. The<br />\nengineer illustrated his talk by<br />\nmeans of profuse slides, tables<br />\nand diagrams. Photographs of<br />\nthe largest power stations, both<br />\nsteam and electric, in the United<br />\nStates were shown.<br />\nThe growth of industry in the<br />\nUnited States was traced, from<br />\nthe development of the steam engine and boiler by James Watt to<br />\nthe present era, in which one-half<br />\nof all power in the world is used<br />\nby this country. Watt was declared by Mr. Orrick to be more<br />\nresponsible than any other man<br />\nfor this growth, because of his invention of the steam condensor,<br />\nwater jacket, engine governor and<br />\nsteam indicator.<br />\nNearly a century elapsed after<br />\nWatt's invention before full development of the steam engine occurred. This was largely due to<br />\nthe invention of the incandescent<br />\nlamp by Edison, and the subsequent growth of electricity in industry. The greatest development<br />\noccurred during the early part of<br />\n1900, when De Lav-al and Parsons<br />\nproduced their turbines. These<br />\nreduced labor, oil, and repair to<br />\na marked degree.<br />\nEngines are now using 60 per<br />\ncent, of the fuel that would have<br />\nbeen necessary in 1900 to deliver<br />\nthe same power. Achievements<br />\nhave brought the efficiency of<br />\nsteam boilers to almost the theoretical limit. The remarkable advancement was graphically shown<br />\nwhen Mr. Orrick stated, \"In past<br />\nyears 400 billion ton-miles of<br />\nfreight were transported. To do<br />\nthis a century ago would have necessitated the use of a billion and<br />\na quarter men.\"<br />\nThe steam engine took thirty<br />\nyears to develop and twenty years<br />\nto perfect to its present high degree. Few engineers look to see<br />\nany marked increase in its efficiency.

They have, one by one, relinquished the responsibility which they have borne for four years and have turned to the<br />\nsterner task of graduation and the taking up of their life's work. The<br />\nJuniors, timid and uncertain of their ability, have stepped in, and,<br />\nguided by the more experienced hands of the Seniors, have gradually<br />\nassumed control of undergraduate affairs.<br />\nThe student body, however, still has its most important task<br />\nbefore it. It must select, next Thursday, the man who is to be its<br />\nacknowledged leader for the coming collegiate year. And hut few<br />\nrealize the importance of this election. The President of the Student<br />\nCouncil is the most influential and, at the same time, one of the most<br />\npowerful men on the campus. As the acknowledged head he dictates, for a large part, the policies and is the representative from the<br />\nstudent body to the outside world. It is to him that the Faculty,<br />\nthe press and other colleges turn when they desire the views of the<br />\nHopkins undergraduates.<br />\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that we shudder as we note<br />\nthe general indifference and nonchalance concerning the coming elections. The man chosen for this position must possess certain definite qualities. He must be respected and admired by the students<br />\nand must be one worthy to represent and to speak for Hopkins off<br />\nof the campus. It is essential that, during the next two days, the<br />\nname of each candidate be carefully considered and his qualities thoroughly analyzed. We could not atttempt to indicate the harm which<br />\nthe wrong man in such a position might bring about.<br />\nFAILURE?<br />\nAt the beginning of the collegiate year a committee was appointed to consider the advisability of a June Week. This committee, upon investigation, decided that Johns Hopkins had grown to<br />\nsuch an extent that it could stage festivities on an elaborate scale.<br />\nIt felt that the undergraduates would not support mediocrity and no<br />\nexpense was spared in the making of preparations.<br />\nAt present, with four weeks to go, all is in readiness. Nationally<br />\nknown orchestra have been procured, halls have been rented, decorations are in the process of completion. The stage is set for a week of<br />\nfestivities such as Johns Hopkins has never experienced. Contracts,<br />\nsigned by the committee, aggregate several thousands of dollars.<br />\nWith this comes the announcement that the undergraduate body<br />\nhas failed. At a meeting of the committee held last week it was<br />\nannounced that but twenty-eight tickets had been paid for.<br />\nIt is essential that three hundred tickets be sold. The committee,<br />\nwhile asserting that \"the affair will be put over right or not at all,\"<br />\nmaintains confidence in the student body. Less than two weeks re-main before final returns must be in. A successful June Week would<br />\nbe an unbeatable advertisement for the \"new\" Johns Hopkins. Failure<br />\nwould not only be difficult to live down, but would also be a distinct disappointment to many who are looking forward to the events.<br />\nThe matter remains in the hands of the undergraduates. Neither<br />\ncommittee nor students will consent to mediocrity. Will our first<br />\nJune Week, advertised throughout the State for six months, be called<br />\noff? The ticket .sale, during the next two weeks, will answer the<br />\nquery.<br />\n<br />\n\\\\.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\nv'<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWanted<br />\n<br />\nmen tofind the answer<br />\nrrHIS is written to the man who loves to seek the<br />\n<br />\nPublished in<br />\nthe interest ofElectrical Development by<br />\nan Institution that will<br />\nbe helped by whatever helps the<br />\nIndustry.<br />\n<br />\nI. unknown quantity.

DR. M. W. DEWART DELIVERS \"SERMON\" AT ASSEMBLY<br />\nContinued from page 1<br />\n<br />\ntiate his statement that the soldiers who did he fighting were<br />\nthe least vindictive, Dr. Dewart,<br />\nwho served as chaplain with a<br />\nfield artillery unit, told of the humane treatment his men gave a<br />\nfew captives, shortly after they<br />\nhad threatened to badly damage<br />\nthe first Boches they laid hands<br />\non. The soldiers at the front had<br />\nopportunity to learn that their<br />\nenemies were, after all, little different from themselves.<br />\nThe feminist movement here<br />\nand in England, has been responsible for less chivalrous treatment<br />\nof women. The women went after certain rights that they doubtlessly deserved; but, in order to<br />\nget these certain rights, many of<br />\nthem became -\"militants\" and<br />\nwent to extremes. The results<br />\nhave been disastrous, for womanhood is not regarded as highly<br />\nas it was formerly. In their<br />\nfight for a single standard of morality, the feminists were successful; but, instead of elevating the<br />\nmen to the code that had been<br />\nset for women, the standard set<br />\nfor men was adopted for both<br />\nsexes.<br />\nTo remedy these conditions,<br />\nDr. Dewart declared a speedy<br />\nrestoration of honor, chivalry, and<br />\nidealism is necessary. To bring<br />\nabout this restoration is the work<br />\nof the young people, for the old<br />\nare too often inclined to 'stand<br />\npat\", and too willing to let well<br />\nenough alone. The speaker said<br />\nhe was asking nothing impossible, for modern society depends<br />\non these three qualities for a<br />\nhealthy existence. Dr. Dewart's<br />\nspeech was sincere and convincing, and the force with which he<br />\nspoke held the interest of his audience.<br />\nPrevious to Dr. Dewart's address, Tom Landy called for support of the June. Week activities. The sale of tickets has been<br />\ngoing slowly. The committee<br />\nwants to put the Week across in<br />\ngood style, but unless better support is forthcoming, the whole affair stands a good chance to fizzle. Tom emphatically stated<br />\nthat this was to be NO fraternity<br />\nparty. The name of the Interfraternity Dance has been changed to Activities Dance, and plans<br />\nare under way to add to the arrangements already made for nonfraternity men.<br />\nDon Vanneman gave an outline of the plans for the \"circus\"<br />\nto be held on Saturday, June 9,<br />\nfrom 8.00 to 10.00 P. M. There<br />\nwill be two rings, a platform, a<br />\nrace track, side shows, pink lemonade, peanuts, and all the usual<br />\nfixings. The committee plans to<br />\nhire an elephant for the affair,<br />\nand the Jungle Circle will be invited to attend. The price of admission will be in the neighborhood of the nominal sum of five<br />\ncents. A dance will be held after the circus. Vanneman recalled the success of the demonstrations during the football season, and asked for help and<br />\ncooperation to duplicate that success. Individuals or groups of<br />\nfellows who have ideas for stunts,<br />\nto be performed by themselves or<br />\nothers, should communicate with<br />\nVanneman, P. 0. Box 661.

A. Orrick Addresses<br />\nEngineering Upperclassmen<br />\n'\u20221 he tremendous developments<br />\nand inventions of new machinery<br />\nin the last century have enabled<br />\none man to accomplish in industry what formerly required six<br />\nhundred and thirty-five men to<br />\ndo,\" was the declaration of George<br />\nA. Orrick, noted consulting engineer, of New York City.<br />\nMr. Orrick, who addressed a<br />\ngroup of engineering upper-classmen last Monday, April 30, on the<br />\nsubject of \"Power Development,<br />\nPast and Future,\" is the director<br />\nand builder of many of the lagest<br />\npower plants in the East during<br />\nthe last quarter of a century. The<br />\nengineer illustrated his talk by<br />\nmeans of profuse slides, tables<br />\nand diagrams. Photographs of<br />\nthe largest power stations, both<br />\nsteam and electric, in the United<br />\nStates were shown.<br />\nThe growth of industry in the<br />\nUnited States was traced, from<br />\nthe development of the steam engine and boiler by James Watt to<br />\nthe present era, in which one-half<br />\nof all power in the world is used<br />\nby this country. Watt was declared by Mr. Orrick to be more<br />\nresponsible than any other man<br />\nfor this growth, because of his invention of the steam condensor,<br />\nwater jacket, engine governor and<br />\nsteam indicator.<br />\nNearly a century elapsed after<br />\nWatt's invention before full development of the steam engine occurred. This was largely due to<br />\nthe invention of the incandescent<br />\nlamp by Edison, and the subsequent growth of electricity in industry. The greatest development<br />\noccurred during the early part of<br />\n1900, when De Lav-al and Parsons<br />\nproduced their turbines. These<br />\nreduced labor, oil, and repair to<br />\na marked degree.<br />\nEngines are now using 60 per<br />\ncent, of the fuel that would have<br />\nbeen necessary in 1900 to deliver<br />\nthe same power.

They have, one by one, relinquished the responsibility which they have borne for four years and have turned to the<br />\nsterner task of graduation and the taking up of their life's work. The<br />\nJuniors, timid and uncertain of their ability, have stepped in, and,<br />\nguided by the more experienced hands of the Seniors, have gradually<br />\nassumed control of undergraduate affairs.<br />\nThe student body, however, still has its most important task<br />\nbefore it. It must select, next Thursday, the man who is to be its<br />\nacknowledged leader for the coming collegiate year. And hut few<br />\nrealize the importance of this election. The President of the Student<br />\nCouncil is the most influential and, at the same time, one of the most<br />\npowerful men on the campus. As the acknowledged head he dictates, for a large part, the policies and is the representative from the<br />\nstudent body to the outside world. It is to him that the Faculty,<br />\nthe press and other colleges turn when they desire the views of the<br />\nHopkins undergraduates.<br />\nIt is with these thoughts in mind that we shudder as we note<br />\nthe general indifference and nonchalance concerning the coming elections. The man chosen for this position must possess certain definite qualities. He must be respected and admired by the students<br />\nand must be one worthy to represent and to speak for Hopkins off<br />\nof the campus. It is essential that, during the next two days, the<br />\nname of each candidate be carefully considered and his qualities thoroughly analyzed. We could not atttempt to indicate the harm which<br />\nthe wrong man in such a position might bring about.<br />\nFAILURE?<br />\nAt the beginning of the collegiate year a committee was appointed to consider the advisability of a June Week. This committee, upon investigation, decided that Johns Hopkins had grown to<br />\nsuch an extent that it could stage festivities on an elaborate scale.<br />\nIt felt that the undergraduates would not support mediocrity and no<br />\nexpense was spared in the making of preparations.<br />\nAt present, with four weeks to go, all is in readiness. Nationally<br />\nknown orchestra have been procured, halls have been rented, decorations are in the process of completion. The stage is set for a week of<br />\nfestivities such as Johns Hopkins has never experienced. Contracts,<br />\nsigned by the committee, aggregate several thousands of dollars.<br />\nWith this comes the announcement that the undergraduate body<br />\nhas failed. At a meeting of the committee held last week it was<br />\nannounced that but twenty-eight tickets had been paid for.<br />\nIt is essential that three hundred tickets be sold. The committee,<br />\nwhile asserting that \"the affair will be put over right or not at all,\"<br />\nmaintains confidence in the student body. Less than two weeks re-main before final returns must be in. A successful June Week would<br />\nbe an unbeatable advertisement for the \"new\" Johns Hopkins. Failure<br />\nwould not only be difficult to live down, but would also be a distinct disappointment to many who are looking forward to the events.<br />\nThe matter remains in the hands of the undergraduates. Neither<br />\ncommittee nor students will consent to mediocrity. Will our first<br />\nJune Week, advertised throughout the State for six months, be called<br />\noff?

The soldiers at the front had<br />\nopportunity to learn that their<br />\nenemies were, after all, little different from themselves.<br />\nThe feminist movement here<br />\nand in England, has been responsible for less chivalrous treatment<br />\nof women. The women went after certain rights that they doubtlessly deserved; but, in order to<br />\nget these certain rights, many of<br />\nthem became -\"militants\" and<br />\nwent to extremes. The results<br />\nhave been disastrous, for womanhood is not regarded as highly<br />\nas it was formerly. In their<br />\nfight for a single standard of morality, the feminists were successful; but, instead of elevating the<br />\nmen to the code that had been<br />\nset for women, the standard set<br />\nfor men was adopted for both<br />\nsexes.<br />\nTo remedy these conditions,<br />\nDr. Dewart declared a speedy<br />\nrestoration of honor, chivalry, and<br />\nidealism is necessary. To bring<br />\nabout this restoration is the work<br />\nof the young people, for the old<br />\nare too often inclined to 'stand<br />\npat\", and too willing to let well<br />\nenough alone. The speaker said<br />\nhe was asking nothing impossible, for modern society depends<br />\non these three qualities for a<br />\nhealthy existence. Dr. Dewart's<br />\nspeech was sincere and convincing, and the force with which he<br />\nspoke held the interest of his audience.<br />\nPrevious to Dr. Dewart's address, Tom Landy called for support of the June. Week activities. The sale of tickets has been<br />\ngoing slowly. The committee<br />\nwants to put the Week across in<br />\ngood style, but unless better support is forthcoming, the whole affair stands a good chance to fizzle. Tom emphatically stated<br />\nthat this was to be NO fraternity<br />\nparty. The name of the Interfraternity Dance has been changed to Activities Dance, and plans<br />\nare under way to add to the arrangements already made for nonfraternity men.<br />\nDon Vanneman gave an outline of the plans for the \"circus\"<br />\nto be held on Saturday, June 9,<br />\nfrom 8.00 to 10.00 P. M. There<br />\nwill be two rings, a platform, a<br />\nrace track, side shows, pink lemonade, peanuts, and all the usual<br />\nfixings. The committee plans to<br />\nhire an elephant for the affair,<br />\nand the Jungle Circle will be invited to attend. The price of admission will be in the neighborhood of the nominal sum of five<br />\ncents. A dance will be held after the circus. Vanneman recalled the success of the demonstrations during the football season, and asked for help and<br />\ncooperation to duplicate that success.
