Stanley Hall, first professor of psychology at this university. Many are<br />\nmourning the death of, the pioneer<br />\npsychologist who died last Thursday, April 24, at his home in New<br />\nEngland.

Heads of<br />\npsychology departments in colleges<br />\nall over the country owe their original interest in the subject to inspiration received from him. Hopkins graduates in particular have a<br />\nlively remembrance of his courses.\"<br />\nDr. Hall was born on February<br />\n1, 1846, He received his A. B. degree from Williams in 1867. His<br />\nsubsequent studies were extensive.<br />\nHe studied at Union Theological<br />\nSeminary and received his Ph. D.<br />\nfrom Heidelburg. Later he was<br />\nthe recipient of other degrees at<br />\nHarvard, Hopkins and other universities. In 1881 he came to Hopkins to become head of the newly<br />\norganized department of psychology, which position he held until<br />\n1888, when he became President of<br />\nClark University, which had just<br />\nbeen founded. His successful administration there lasted until 1920,<br />\nwhen he retired with the title of<br />\nPresident Emeritus, which he held<br />\nuntil his death.<br />\nDr. Hall was an undisputed leader in American psychology. While<br />\nat Hopkins he founded the first<br />\npsychological laboratory in the<br />\nUnited States. In 1892 he organized and became president of the<br />\nAmerican Psychological Association, and in 1897 he helped found<br />\nthe American Journal of Psychology. Shortly before his death Dr.<br />\nHall was again elected president of<br />\nthe American Psychological Association as a tribute for his wonderful research work.<br />\nMany books, ten of which are<br />\npsychology texts, were written by<br />\nDr. Hall.

Booth and Clarke<br />\nran away with track honors at the Penn Relay Carnival; the baseball<br />\nteam defeated Dickinson; the lacrosse team scored a signal victory<br />\nover the Naval Academy. The Navy defeat, the first suffered from<br />\nthe hands of a Hopkins team for seven years, was of such a nature<br />\nas to thrill the large crowd that thronged the stands. In addition to<br />\nthis the undergraduate body made a splendid showing at the Navy<br />\ngame. Our teams are to be congratulated for their excellent work;<br />\nthe student body is to be congratulated for its loyal support.<br />\nOne thing, however, stands in the way of a perfect spring sport<br />\nseason. This is the lacrosse team of the University of Maryland.<br />\nLet us, then, adopt the slogan \"plow up Maryland.\"<br />\nTHINK THIS OVER<br />\nOnly the warm rays of Spring's sunlight were needed to loose<br />\nthe political bee that has been buzzing under cover for many months.<br />\nNoise from that little bee is heard as one by one the campus positions<br />\nare surrendered from senior hands to underclassmen. Elections to<br />\nthe Athletic Board and the Student Council, by far the most important positions on the campus, are scheduled to be held within a few<br />\nweeks. It may seem early to get down to definite decisions, yet it<br />\ndoes not mean that the Student Body should not start at once to<br />\nthink about the business to be conducted within a short time. Rather<br />\ndoes it mean that there is all too little time left for thorough consideration and sincere deliberation of the affair of electing officers to responsible posts.<br />\nAs far as records of human activity extend, evidences of conspiracies are found whereby \"politicians\" were aided in securing<br />\npower. Descendants of noted political tribes seem to have come<br />\nupon the campus of many colleges. In fact, a college campus is<br />\noften characterized as being controlled by this or that faction. It is<br />\nregrettable, yet logical, that fraternities should be made the seat of<br />\nsuch political factions. At some colleges it is known that many<br />\nstudents automatically support a candidate merely because he happens to be a member of their fraternity, or of their \"allied\" fraternity.<br />\nThe men in the ranks of the so-called opposition are never considered,<br />\neven though they possess merits which deserve the closest attention.<br />\nThen there are some who do not worry their heads about candidates;<br />\nthey cast a ballot, usually,accepting the advice of some kind-hearted<br />\nfriend.<br />\nIt is interesting to note what a prominent college paper has to say<br />\nregarding student voting and to apply their thought to Hopkins, unfortunately in the swirl of political activity. In the McGill Daily<br />\nwe read\u2014\"Vote, but above all things, vote intelligently. There really<br />\nshould be no need whatever to urge intelligent action among university students. But even the best regulated humans are liable to permit their biased enthusiasm to cover up and smother their reason;<br />\nand even the most precise and business-like may lapse, because of<br />\nthe weakness of nature, into a period of haphazard action.\"<br />\nWe wish to repeat\u2014\"Vote, but above all things, vote intelligently.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe winning advertisements on<br />\n_Postum Products--selected<br />\nfrom the 5000 sent in<br />\nOn November 22, 1923, the Postum Company announced its Prize<br />\nAdvertisement Writing Contest.

For a relatively<br />\nunknown author, it is rather an acid<br />\ntest to be on the same program<br />\nwith Shakespeare and Rostand.<br />\n'The Six Stokers Who Owned<br />\nthe Bloomin' Earth,\" by E. L.<br />\nGreenefelder, a Hopkins alumnus.<br />\nwas the curtain raiser for this last<br />\nproductioni\u2014a curtain raiser that<br />\nwas a full thirty minutes late. Except for John Earle Uhler, the male<br />\nmembers of the cast were unable<br />\nto shake off a strained unnaturalness that presented the illusion so<br />\nnecessary in symbolic drama. The<br />\ngrouping at the curtain and the<br />\nironic note throughout Were, however, most effective.<br />\nThe one act version of Edward<br />\nRostand's \"Les Romanesques,\" was<br />\nin general charmingly interpreted,<br />\nalthough the miscasting of Arnold<br />\nFrank as Pasquinot destroyed much<br />\nof the atmosphere so well achieved<br />\nby the other characters. The gentle,<br />\nromantic, fantastic, slightly mocking tone of Rostand's was delicately brought out.<br />\nScene II. from the third act of<br />\n\"Henry VIII.\" was the most pretentious attempt of the trio, and, on<br />\nthe whole, the most successful. The<br />\nacting of Stanley Worden as Wolsey rang true at all times, and although Norman Bean, as Surrey,<br />\nbore a much closer physical resemblance to the reproductions of<br />\nHenry than did Bromley Smith, the<br />\nfour actors seemed perfectly at<br />\nhome in their roles.<br />\nIt is interesting to note the much<br />\nmore finished performance of Gerald B. Bryan as the Cromwell of<br />\nShakespeare than the same actor's<br />\ninterpretation of Etcetero in the<br />\nfirst playlet of the production. All<br />\namateurishness vanished when the<br />\npart was really large enough, definite enough to be grasped by the<br />\nactor.<br />\nThe presence of several undergraduates in the cast and of more<br />\nthan the usual quota in the audience was especially noticeable.<br />\nThe music was an integral part<br />\nof the presentation and up to its<br />\nusual standard. Of the mechanical equipment, only the lighting appeared cramped, but nevertheless<br />\nremarkable in so small a theater.<br />\nShorty\u2014\"Ah tell you, nigger,<br />\nGeorge wuz the honestest man<br />\ndat ever wuz born.\"<br />\nLong Boy\u2014\"Den, how come<br />\ndey closes de banks on his birfday?\"\u2014Georgia Cracker.<br />\n<br />\nBATTING AVERAGES<br />\nAB.

Stanley Hall, first professor of psychology at this university. Many are<br />\nmourning the death of, the pioneer<br />\npsychologist who died last Thursday, April 24, at his home in New<br />\nEngland. Hopkins men who studied under Dr. Hall during the<br />\nseven years of his Hopkins professorship dating from 1881 to<br />\n1888 feel the great extent of the<br />\nworld's loss.<br />\nDr. Dunlap, head of the Psychology Department at Johns Hopkins,<br />\neulogized the deceased professor.<br />\n\"He was,\" said Dr. Dunlap, \"a<br />\nmost stimulating teacher. Heads of<br />\npsychology departments in colleges<br />\nall over the country owe their original interest in the subject to inspiration received from him. Hopkins graduates in particular have a<br />\nlively remembrance of his courses.\"<br />\nDr. Hall was born on February<br />\n1, 1846, He received his A. B. degree from Williams in 1867. His<br />\nsubsequent studies were extensive.<br />\nHe studied at Union Theological<br />\nSeminary and received his Ph. D.<br />\nfrom Heidelburg. Later he was<br />\nthe recipient of other degrees at<br />\nHarvard, Hopkins and other universities. In 1881 he came to Hopkins to become head of the newly<br />\norganized department of psychology, which position he held until<br />\n1888, when he became President of<br />\nClark University, which had just<br />\nbeen founded. His successful administration there lasted until 1920,<br />\nwhen he retired with the title of<br />\nPresident Emeritus, which he held<br />\nuntil his death.<br />\nDr. Hall was an undisputed leader in American psychology. While<br />\nat Hopkins he founded the first<br />\npsychological laboratory in the<br />\nUnited States. In 1892 he organized and became president of the<br />\nAmerican Psychological Association, and in 1897 he helped found<br />\nthe American Journal of Psychology. Shortly before his death Dr.<br />\nHall was again elected president of<br />\nthe American Psychological Association as a tribute for his wonderful research work.<br />\nMany books, ten of which are<br />\npsychology texts, were written by<br />\nDr. Hall. In his \"Confessions of a<br />\nPsychologist\" he tells how he advised Woodrow Wilson to abandon<br />\npsychology for political science.<br /><br />\nNOTICES<br />\nTENNIS<br />\nGeorgetown, May 1<br />\nMaryland, May 3<br />\nf<br />\nFreshmen who are going to<br />\nthe banquet hand names to Cleff<br />\nor Marley before Friday.<br /><br />\nAs the teams of old had played, so played the Black and Blue<br />\nSaturday at Homewood Field when the Hopkins lacrosse team sank<br />\nthe Navy by the score of 5 to 4.

Booth and Clarke<br />\nran away with track honors at the Penn Relay Carnival; the baseball<br />\nteam defeated Dickinson; the lacrosse team scored a signal victory<br />\nover the Naval Academy. The Navy defeat, the first suffered from<br />\nthe hands of a Hopkins team for seven years, was of such a nature<br />\nas to thrill the large crowd that thronged the stands. In addition to<br />\nthis the undergraduate body made a splendid showing at the Navy<br />\ngame. Our teams are to be congratulated for their excellent work;<br />\nthe student body is to be congratulated for its loyal support.<br />\nOne thing, however, stands in the way of a perfect spring sport<br />\nseason. This is the lacrosse team of the University of Maryland.<br />\nLet us, then, adopt the slogan \"plow up Maryland.\"<br />\nTHINK THIS OVER<br />\nOnly the warm rays of Spring's sunlight were needed to loose<br />\nthe political bee that has been buzzing under cover for many months.<br />\nNoise from that little bee is heard as one by one the campus positions<br />\nare surrendered from senior hands to underclassmen. Elections to<br />\nthe Athletic Board and the Student Council, by far the most important positions on the campus, are scheduled to be held within a few<br />\nweeks. It may seem early to get down to definite decisions, yet it<br />\ndoes not mean that the Student Body should not start at once to<br />\nthink about the business to be conducted within a short time. Rather<br />\ndoes it mean that there is all too little time left for thorough consideration and sincere deliberation of the affair of electing officers to responsible posts.<br />\nAs far as records of human activity extend, evidences of conspiracies are found whereby \"politicians\" were aided in securing<br />\npower. Descendants of noted political tribes seem to have come<br />\nupon the campus of many colleges. In fact, a college campus is<br />\noften characterized as being controlled by this or that faction. It is<br />\nregrettable, yet logical, that fraternities should be made the seat of<br />\nsuch political factions. At some colleges it is known that many<br />\nstudents automatically support a candidate merely because he happens to be a member of their fraternity, or of their \"allied\" fraternity.<br />\nThe men in the ranks of the so-called opposition are never considered,<br />\neven though they possess merits which deserve the closest attention.<br />\nThen there are some who do not worry their heads about candidates;<br />\nthey cast a ballot, usually,accepting the advice of some kind-hearted<br />\nfriend.<br />\nIt is interesting to note what a prominent college paper has to say<br />\nregarding student voting and to apply their thought to Hopkins, unfortunately in the swirl of political activity. In the McGill Daily<br />\nwe read\u2014\"Vote, but above all things, vote intelligently. There really<br />\nshould be no need whatever to urge intelligent action among university students. But even the best regulated humans are liable to permit their biased enthusiasm to cover up and smother their reason;<br />\nand even the most precise and business-like may lapse, because of<br />\nthe weakness of nature, into a period of haphazard action.\"<br />\nWe wish to repeat\u2014\"Vote, but above all things, vote intelligently.\"<br /><br />\nThe winning advertisements on<br />\n_Postum Products--selected<br />\nfrom the 5000 sent in<br />\nOn November 22, 1923, the Postum Company announced its Prize<br />\nAdvertisement Writing Contest.
