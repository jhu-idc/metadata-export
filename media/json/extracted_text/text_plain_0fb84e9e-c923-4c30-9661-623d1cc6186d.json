It was, naturally, a great pity that<br />\nthe vehicle chosen (the actual article) was a tasteless<br />\nand largely uninformative commentary on the Towson<br />\n<br />\nSweetie Pie<br />\n<br />\nKudos to Reborn Barnstormers<br />\nBy GERALD BRECHER<br />\nWell, it certainly is nice to find<br />\nout that the Barnstormers actually still exist. What with Ed<br />\nGolden and company monopolizng the Barn for the past year,<br />\nand what seems to have been a<br />\nsubstantial cut in the Barnstormers' share of the Student<br />\nActivity budget, the Barnstormers seemed to sort of roll over<br />\nand if not die, then at least remain comatose.<br />\nNo one ever would have<br />\ndreamed of terming the Barnstormers truly excellent. But it is<br />\na troupe of enthusiastic undergraduates who in the past have<br />\nput on some supremely competent and at times dazzling performances. In recent years those<br />\nthat come to mind especially are<br />\nJ.B., Rashomon, and the first<br />\nBarnstormer musical ever, The<br />\nFantasticks.<br />\nThe Barnstormers date back<br />\nover thirty years and were widely<br />\nknown in Baltimore in their early days. Today we have Theatre<br />\nHopkins and pretty good nonprofessional theatre and what<br />\nhas seemed to be an almost total anemia with regard to the<br />\nundergraduate theatre.<br />\nThis past weekend however<br />\nthe Barnstormers showed some<br />\nlife. Two one-act plays, produced<br />\nby senior Dave Ricci, an active<br />\nBarnstormer for four years, were<br />\npresented Saturday and Sunday<br />\nevenings. The first, A. A. Milne's<br />\nThe Ugly Duckling, directed by<br />\nJack Teider, was a delightful performance of this adaptation of<br />\nthe old fairy tale by the author<br />\nof Winnie the Pooh. The staging<br />\nand costuming were sort of bizarre\u2014on the order of low camp<br />\nperhaps\u2014but the acting was a<br />\nsheer joy.<br />\nVinee Millard was properly regal as the king (if anyone could<br />\npossibly be regal dressed like<br />\nthat!) and played the role with<br />\nan almost professional 'majesty.<br />\n<br />\nversion of libido.<br />\nBut if you will allow, we will also take this opportunity to congratulate ourselves on getting in on the<br />\nfun and perhaps proving once and for all the preservation of a sense of folly is the profoundest insurance<br />\nagainst such a sad loss of emotional perspective and<br />\ncritical proportion.<br />\nThe News-Letter apologizes to all Hopkins for bowing to the administrations of both institutions and not<br />\nreprinting the article as we had originally planned. We<br />\nurge you find what is by now a collectors item, certainly<br />\na journalistic curiosity, and insert it in the blank space<br />\non page five.<br />\nWe shall only employ in our defense the words of<br />\nWillie Davis to Sandy Koufax: \"The suns not yellow,<br />\nit's chicken \"<br />\n<br />\nOpen Door Policy<br />\nThe decision of the Administration to permit girls<br />\nin the freshman dormitories is one which we heartily<br />\nsupport. Hopefully, it is indicative of an increased University concern for the extra-academic problems confronting those living on campus.<br />\nTo a great extent, the responsibility for further<br />\nchange lies with the freshmen themselves. Abuse of the<br />\nprivilege can only reinforce the Administration's faith in<br />\nthe status quo and undo whatever progress is being<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe hours that have been set up, namely from noon<br />\nto 1 a.m., are liberal indeed, with the credit for their<br />\nestablishment going to Colonel Serena. If the plan does<br />\nprove to be practicable, we see no reason why the visiting privileges should not be extended to include Friday<br />\nevening and all day Sunday.<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 4, 1966<br />\n<br />\nHis facial expressions made Miss analogies, and the play was put<br />\nMilne's quite witty lines seem as on with gusto and intensity, at<br />\nif they were written for him not any great subtlety.<br />\nalone; his performance must cerDave Ricci directed this play,<br />\ntainly be termed a tour de force.<br />\nand it reflected in its performCarol Christman played the ance his own affinities in the<br />\npart of the princess with con- dramatic art.

Unfortunately,<br />\nthe student body as a whole<br />\nknows very little about these<br />\nwords. For example, very few<br />\nFreshmen know that the bookstore, dormitories, dining hall,<br />\ncafeteria, and snack bar are all<br />\nrun by the plant manager's office<br />\nand not by a private business<br />\nconcern. Most students are well<br />\naware that the bookstore operates at a substantial profit, but<br />\nvery few students are aware that<br />\nthe dining hall operates at a<br />\nsubstantial Wes. The money from<br />\nall of these enterprises is put<br />\ntogether in one plant manager's<br />\nbudget, which operates just a<br />\nlittle bit in the black. One enterprise's losses are made up by<br />\nanother one's profits. If the<br />\nbookstore's profits were removed<br />\nfrom the plant manager's budget, more money would have to<br />\ncome in from one of the other<br />\nenterprises. Thus by lowering the<br />\nprice of books, the price of tuition, room or board could conceivably go up. It is however, unfair that all of the students<br />\nshould pay high book prices so<br />\nthat the plant manager can effectively subsidize the dining hall<br />\nfor the benefit of the students<br />\nliving on campus. The bookstore<br />\nshould not operate at a profit,<br />\nnor should the dining hall operate at a loss.<br />\nMany students signed a petir<br />\nMon urging that the bookstore<br />\n<br />\nbe removed entirely from the<br />\nplant manager's office and reestablished as a cooperative. A<br />\ncooperative will, however, place<br />\nan extremely heavy burden on<br />\nthe students who have to run<br />\nit. How many students who<br />\nsigned the petition are really<br />\nwilling to devote the time and<br />\nwork necessary to insure proper<br />\nmanagement of the student coopertive?<br />\nIt is my opinion that the administration does not have to be<br />\nintimidated by the threat of a<br />\nboycott to correct the faults and<br />\ndo what is fair with regard to<br />\nthe bookstore.<br />\nBill LaCorte, '70<br />\n<br />\nParties Sans<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was annoyed by the article<br />\n\"Election Results Predicted to<br />\nMaintain Trends\" in the October 28 isue of the News-Letter.<br />\nThe source of my annoyance was<br />\nMr. Lebar's attempt to downgrade the Democratic Party and<br />\nto raise his precious Republican<br />\nParty to the lvvel of a deity. Mr.<br />\nLebar's procedure in doing this<br />\nwas obvious. He simply pointed<br />\nto all the Southern Democratic<br />\nbigots such as George Wallace<br />\nand Lester Maddox, who disown<br />\nthe national party most of the<br />\ntime, and George Mahoney, who<br />\nthe national party has disowned.<br />\nThen he said, in so many words,<br />\nthat the Democratic Party has<br />\nbecome the haven for bigots,<br />\nwhile the Republican Party consists of \"tolerant\" conservatives.<br />\n<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nBut what about all those Democratic liberals he mentioned, but<br />\nso lightly passed over in his<br />\narticle? As a former resident of<br />\nMassachusetts, I am appalled to<br />\nsee the name of Endicott Peabody linked to ,the intelligence<br />\nand the beliefs of men like Lester<br />\nMaddox. Mr. Peabody is a true<br />\nliberal, following the same precepts as men like John F. Kennedy. As a leader he has been<br />\noutspoken on all the major issues<br />\nfrom civil rights to Viet Nam,<br />\nalways supporting the liberal<br />\ncause. He comes from a family<br />\nof liberal thinking people, emphasized last year when his<br />\nmother was arrested in the south<br />\nwhile taking part in a civil rights<br />\ndemonstration. As a governor,<br />\nPeabody pushed through more<br />\nworthwhile legislation than any<br />\ngovernor in recent history.<br />\nAmong his successes were the<br />\ncurbing of the power of the<br />\npesky governor's council, which<br />\nused to have vote power over<br />\nthe governor, and the lengthening of the governor's term from<br />\n2 to 4 years. Both measures were<br />\nlong awaited. Now let us examine<br />\nMr. Peabody's opponent for Senator, Edward Brooke, to whom<br />\nMr. Lebar brought special attention because Brooke is a Negro.<br />\nBrooke has been Attorney General of Massachusetts for four<br />\nyears and he has done a \"good\"<br />\njob. However, during this period<br />\nof four years, Brooke has introduced very few, if any, bills and<br />\nhas not been outspoken on any<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 4, 1966<br />\n<br />\nNEW<br />\n<br />\nPAGE FIVE<br />\n<br />\n8th SISTER INDEED<br />\nThey Wore Their Red A's Ragged<br />\n<br />\nhe Knack\"?<br />\nMake Love;<br />\n<br />\nlt`st<br />\n<br />\n\u201e<br />\n<br />\nealaedopendeitCe<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br />\n<br />\nTit<br />\n<br />\nsubjects. In fact, in his campaign<br />\nfor Senator against Mr. Peabody,<br />\nhe has taken a \"middle of the<br />\nroad\" position, and his counselors find that the less Brooke<br />\nsays, the better. As for being a<br />\nNegro, the Negro community has<br />\nnot found a leader in Brooke.<br />\nBrooke again keeps quiet on this<br />\nsubject, preferring not to be<br />\nlinked publicly with the NAACP<br />\nor any similar organization.<br />\nMr. Lebar looks down on the<br />\nDemocratic Party because it is<br />\nthe name of the party of George<br />\nWallace and George Mahoney.<br />\nFrankly, I, too, look down on<br />\nGeorge Wallace and George Mahoney, but I look up to the party<br />\nof men like John F.

Let me turn to my<br />\npresent home state of California<br />\nwhere Governor Pat Brown, with<br />\na successful record of eight years<br />\nbehind him, is opposing ex-actor<br />\nRonald Reagan, who refuses to<br />\nrefute the support of ultra-right<br />\nwing groups like the John Birch<br />\nSociety.

What with Ed<br />\nGolden and company monopolizng the Barn for the past year,<br />\nand what seems to have been a<br />\nsubstantial cut in the Barnstormers' share of the Student<br />\nActivity budget, the Barnstormers seemed to sort of roll over<br />\nand if not die, then at least remain comatose.<br />\nNo one ever would have<br />\ndreamed of terming the Barnstormers truly excellent. But it is<br />\na troupe of enthusiastic undergraduates who in the past have<br />\nput on some supremely competent and at times dazzling performances. In recent years those<br />\nthat come to mind especially are<br />\nJ.B., Rashomon, and the first<br />\nBarnstormer musical ever, The<br />\nFantasticks.<br />\nThe Barnstormers date back<br />\nover thirty years and were widely<br />\nknown in Baltimore in their early days.

Two one-act plays, produced<br />\nby senior Dave Ricci, an active<br />\nBarnstormer for four years, were<br />\npresented Saturday and Sunday<br />\nevenings. The first, A. A. Milne's<br />\nThe Ugly Duckling, directed by<br />\nJack Teider, was a delightful performance of this adaptation of<br />\nthe old fairy tale by the author<br />\nof Winnie the Pooh.

Hopefully, it is indicative of an increased University concern for the extra-academic problems confronting those living on campus.<br />\nTo a great extent, the responsibility for further<br />\nchange lies with the freshmen themselves. Abuse of the<br />\nprivilege can only reinforce the Administration's faith in<br />\nthe status quo and undo whatever progress is being<br />\nmade.<br />\nThe hours that have been set up, namely from noon<br />\nto 1 a.m., are liberal indeed, with the credit for their<br />\nestablishment going to Colonel Serena.

Unfortunately,<br />\nthe student body as a whole<br />\nknows very little about these<br />\nwords. For example, very few<br />\nFreshmen know that the bookstore, dormitories, dining hall,<br />\ncafeteria, and snack bar are all<br />\nrun by the plant manager's office<br />\nand not by a private business<br />\nconcern. Most students are well<br />\naware that the bookstore operates at a substantial profit, but<br />\nvery few students are aware that<br />\nthe dining hall operates at a<br />\nsubstantial Wes. The money from<br />\nall of these enterprises is put<br />\ntogether in one plant manager's<br />\nbudget, which operates just a<br />\nlittle bit in the black. One enterprise's losses are made up by<br />\nanother one's profits. If the<br />\nbookstore's profits were removed<br />\nfrom the plant manager's budget, more money would have to<br />\ncome in from one of the other<br />\nenterprises. Thus by lowering the<br />\nprice of books, the price of tuition, room or board could conceivably go up. It is however, unfair that all of the students<br />\nshould pay high book prices so<br />\nthat the plant manager can effectively subsidize the dining hall<br />\nfor the benefit of the students<br />\nliving on campus. The bookstore<br />\nshould not operate at a profit,<br />\nnor should the dining hall operate at a loss.<br />\nMany students signed a petir<br />\nMon urging that the bookstore<br /><br />\nbe removed entirely from the<br />\nplant manager's office and reestablished as a cooperative. A<br />\ncooperative will, however, place<br />\nan extremely heavy burden on<br />\nthe students who have to run<br />\nit. How many students who<br />\nsigned the petition are really<br />\nwilling to devote the time and<br />\nwork necessary to insure proper<br />\nmanagement of the student coopertive?<br />\nIt is my opinion that the administration does not have to be<br />\nintimidated by the threat of a<br />\nboycott to correct the faults and<br />\ndo what is fair with regard to<br />\nthe bookstore.<br />\nBill LaCorte, '70<br /><br />\nParties Sans<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nI was annoyed by the article<br />\n\"Election Results Predicted to<br />\nMaintain Trends\" in the October 28 isue of the News-Letter.<br />\nThe source of my annoyance was<br />\nMr. Lebar's attempt to downgrade the Democratic Party and<br />\nto raise his precious Republican<br />\nParty to the lvvel of a deity. Mr.<br />\nLebar's procedure in doing this<br />\nwas obvious. He simply pointed<br />\nto all the Southern Democratic<br />\nbigots such as George Wallace<br />\nand Lester Maddox, who disown<br />\nthe national party most of the<br />\ntime, and George Mahoney, who<br />\nthe national party has disowned.<br />\nThen he said, in so many words,<br />\nthat the Democratic Party has<br />\nbecome the haven for bigots,<br />\nwhile the Republican Party consists of \"tolerant\" conservatives.<br /><br />\n1<br /><br />\nBut what about all those Democratic liberals he mentioned, but<br />\nso lightly passed over in his<br />\narticle? As a former resident of<br />\nMassachusetts, I am appalled to<br />\nsee the name of Endicott Peabody linked to ,the intelligence<br />\nand the beliefs of men like Lester<br />\nMaddox. Mr. Peabody is a true<br />\nliberal, following the same precepts as men like John F. Kennedy. As a leader he has been<br />\noutspoken on all the major issues<br />\nfrom civil rights to Viet Nam,<br />\nalways supporting the liberal<br />\ncause. He comes from a family<br />\nof liberal thinking people, emphasized last year when his<br />\nmother was arrested in the south<br />\nwhile taking part in a civil rights<br />\ndemonstration. As a governor,<br />\nPeabody pushed through more<br />\nworthwhile legislation than any<br />\ngovernor in recent history.<br />\nAmong his successes were the<br />\ncurbing of the power of the<br />\npesky governor's council, which<br />\nused to have vote power over<br />\nthe governor, and the lengthening of the governor's term from<br />\n2 to 4 years. Both measures were<br />\nlong awaited. Now let us examine<br />\nMr. Peabody's opponent for Senator, Edward Brooke, to whom<br />\nMr. Lebar brought special attention because Brooke is a Negro.<br />\nBrooke has been Attorney General of Massachusetts for four<br />\nyears and he has done a \"good\"<br />\njob. However, during this period<br />\nof four years, Brooke has introduced very few, if any, bills and<br />\nhas not been outspoken on any<br />\n(Continued on Page 5)<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, NOVEMBER 4, 1966<br /><br />\nNEW<br /><br />\nPAGE FIVE<br /><br />\n8th SISTER INDEED<br />\nThey Wore Their Red A's Ragged<br /><br />\nhe Knack\"?<br />\nMake Love;<br /><br />\nlt`st<br /><br />\n\u201e<br /><br />\nealaedopendeitCe<br />\n(Continued from Page 4)<br /><br />\nTit<br /><br />\nsubjects. In fact, in his campaign<br />\nfor Senator against Mr. Peabody,<br />\nhe has taken a \"middle of the<br />\nroad\" position, and his counselors find that the less Brooke<br />\nsays, the better. As for being a<br />\nNegro, the Negro community has<br />\nnot found a leader in Brooke.<br />\nBrooke again keeps quiet on this<br />\nsubject, preferring not to be<br />\nlinked publicly with the NAACP<br />\nor any similar organization.<br />\nMr. Lebar looks down on the<br />\nDemocratic Party because it is<br />\nthe name of the party of George<br />\nWallace and George Mahoney.<br />\nFrankly, I, too, look down on<br />\nGeorge Wallace and George Mahoney, but I look up to the party<br />\nof men like John F.

Let me turn to my<br />\npresent home state of California<br />\nwhere Governor Pat Brown, with<br />\na successful record of eight years<br />\nbehind him, is opposing ex-actor<br />\nRonald Reagan, who refuses to<br />\nrefute the support of ultra-right<br />\nwing groups like the John Birch<br />\nSociety.
