The reasons for going<br />\nto Washington were that a large<br />\nnumber of the \"freshies\" had never<br />\nbeen to the nation's capital, that<br />\nthey could spend a day sociably together as a class, and that they<br />\nwould be doing something original.<br />\nThe novelty was so successful that<br />\nit was suggested by several -members that the 1915 class hold all its<br />\nfuture banquets in Washington.<br />\nThe party left Baltimore on the<br />\nWashington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric line in a special<br />\ncar at one o'clock.
