It will place the men<br />\naffected on the plane of arts and<br />\nscience professors who devote their<br />\nentire time to their studies. Heretofore, professors occupying chairs<br />\nin medical schools have devoted<br />\nonly certain hours to teaching, while<br />\nthe remainder,of their time has been<br />\ngiven to consultation and private<br />\npractice.<br />\nNow the Hopkins professors of<br />\nmedicine, surgery and pediatrics<br />\nwill devote their entire time to the<br />\nduties of their departments, and<br />\nsuch time as will not be used ih<br />\nactual teaching will be spent in investigation and research. Private<br />\npractice will be given up partly,<br />\nbut the professors will not accept<br />\nany fees from patients. The income of the gift will be used to<br />\nequip new laboratories and pay salaries.<br />\nThe idea originated in England,<br />\nand received its first serious attention in America when it was discussed by Dr. Lewellys F. Barker,<br />\nof Hopkins, eleven years ago in a<br />\nspeech at Chicago. It has been a<br />\n\"hobby\" with Dr. Barker, and, peculiarily enough, he will be one of<br />\nthe men affected by the gift. He<br />\nis professor of medicine.<br />\nThe other men besides Dr.<br />\nBarker who, with their assistants,<br />\nwill carry out the plan are: Dr.<br />\nW. S. Halsted, professor of surgery; Dr. John Howland, professor of pediatrics.<br />\nThat such a reorganization of<br />\nthese branches of medicine has long<br />\nbeen contemplated by the medical<br />\nstaff is well known to Hopkins men.<br />\nDi. William H. Welch, head of<br />\nthe University, since the resignation of Dr. Remsen, went to New<br />\n<br />\nIn spite of a heavy downpour of<br />\nrain which lasted throughout the<br />\ngame, and the field covered with<br />\nwater and mud, the football team<br />\nplayed and won its game against<br />\nStevens Institute at Hoboken last<br />\nSaturday. Although neither team<br />\nwas able to score during the first<br />\ntwo quarters, Hopkins came back<br />\nstrong in the last part of the game<br />\nand played the Hoboken team off<br />\nits feet. The final score was: Hopkins, 12; Stevens, o.<br />\nThe two elevens were about equal<br />\nin weight, with a slight advantage<br />\nin favor of Stevens. Due to the<br />\nslippery condition of the ball,<br />\nfumbles were numerous on both<br />\nsides. The earlier part of the game<br />\nwas entirely straight football, both<br />\nelevens repeatedly plugging their<br />\nopponent's line. Towards the end,<br />\nhowever, Hopkins opened up and<br />\nplayed a passing game, which<br />\nproved successful against the Red<br />\nand White.<br />\nAt 2.45 Stevens kicked off to<br />\nBowers, who returned the ball to<br />\nmid-field before he was downed.<br />\nHopkins then rushed the ball to<br />\nStevens' 20-yard line, only to lose<br />\nit on a fumble. By a series of end<br />\nruns and line plunges, Stevens<br />\nworked the ball to Hopkins' 30-yard<br />\nline, when the whistle blew. Honors were about even in this period.<br />\nThe Black and Blue team started<br />\nthe second quarter by recovering a<br />\nfumble, thereby depriving the Hoboken eleven of an excellent opportunity to score. Hopkins was<br />\nunable to make any impression on<br />\nthe opponent's line, and was forced<br />\nto kick. The heavy ends, called<br />\ninto the backfield, were unable to<br />\nget started when they hit the<br />\nStevens line. Stevens attempted a<br />\nforward pass, but was unsuccessful.<br />\nNear the end of the second quarter,<br />\nTippett tried a drop-kick, but the<br />\nsoggy ground and wet ball allowed<br />\nof no success. Score: Hopkins, o;<br />\nStevens, o.<br />\nAt the opening of the third period, Hopkins made her first touchdown, when Tippett caught a punt<br />\nand circled Stevens' end for a<br />\ntouchdown. The try for goal was<br />\nmissed. The period ended with<br />\nHopkins ahead. Score: Hdpkins,<br />\n6; Stevens, o.<br />\nThe Red and White could gain<br />\nno ground against the Hopkins<br />\nline in the last quarter, and was<br />\n<br />\nPictorial story of progress on Gilman Hall, the central building of<br />\nthe new Johns Hopkins University on the Homewood estate.

The list<br />\nincludes two or three of the best<br />\nrepresentatives of Baltimore's leading stores.<br />\nAll that you have to do is to<br />\nkeep the card in your pocket and<br />\nwhen you find that you need a<br />\ncouple of shirts, or an overcoat, or<br />\na suit of clothes, or a pair of shoes,<br />\nor anything that can be bought<br />\nfrom an advertiser, simply consult<br />\nthe card, make the purchase at one<br />\nof the advertisers, and get him to<br />\ngive you a bill or anything that will<br />\nshow the amount of the purchase.<br />\nReturn this bill or receipt to THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER and get paid for<br />\nit in the form of money, if the,<br />\npurchase is large, or in sodas, sundaes, candy, cigarettes, etc., if the<br />\npurchase is small.<br />\nWe naturally give more for receipts from some advertisers than<br />\nfor others, depending on the size of<br />\ntheir advertisement and the ease<br />\nwith which we can supply them<br />\nwith trade.

It will place the men<br />\naffected on the plane of arts and<br />\nscience professors who devote their<br />\nentire time to their studies. Heretofore, professors occupying chairs<br />\nin medical schools have devoted<br />\nonly certain hours to teaching, while<br />\nthe remainder,of their time has been<br />\ngiven to consultation and private<br />\npractice.<br />\nNow the Hopkins professors of<br />\nmedicine, surgery and pediatrics<br />\nwill devote their entire time to the<br />\nduties of their departments, and<br />\nsuch time as will not be used ih<br />\nactual teaching will be spent in investigation and research. Private<br />\npractice will be given up partly,<br />\nbut the professors will not accept<br />\nany fees from patients. The income of the gift will be used to<br />\nequip new laboratories and pay salaries.<br />\nThe idea originated in England,<br />\nand received its first serious attention in America when it was discussed by Dr. Lewellys F. Barker,<br />\nof Hopkins, eleven years ago in a<br />\nspeech at Chicago. It has been a<br />\n\"hobby\" with Dr. Barker, and, peculiarily enough, he will be one of<br />\nthe men affected by the gift. He<br />\nis professor of medicine.<br />\nThe other men besides Dr.<br />\nBarker who, with their assistants,<br />\nwill carry out the plan are: Dr.<br />\nW. S. Halsted, professor of surgery; Dr. John Howland, professor of pediatrics.<br />\nThat such a reorganization of<br />\nthese branches of medicine has long<br />\nbeen contemplated by the medical<br />\nstaff is well known to Hopkins men.<br />\nDi.

Although neither team<br />\nwas able to score during the first<br />\ntwo quarters, Hopkins came back<br />\nstrong in the last part of the game<br />\nand played the Hoboken team off<br />\nits feet. The final score was: Hopkins, 12; Stevens, o.<br />\nThe two elevens were about equal<br />\nin weight, with a slight advantage<br />\nin favor of Stevens. Due to the<br />\nslippery condition of the ball,<br />\nfumbles were numerous on both<br />\nsides. The earlier part of the game<br />\nwas entirely straight football, both<br />\nelevens repeatedly plugging their<br />\nopponent's line. Towards the end,<br />\nhowever, Hopkins opened up and<br />\nplayed a passing game, which<br />\nproved successful against the Red<br />\nand White.<br />\nAt 2.45 Stevens kicked off to<br />\nBowers, who returned the ball to<br />\nmid-field before he was downed.<br />\nHopkins then rushed the ball to<br />\nStevens' 20-yard line, only to lose<br />\nit on a fumble. By a series of end<br />\nruns and line plunges, Stevens<br />\nworked the ball to Hopkins' 30-yard<br />\nline, when the whistle blew. Honors were about even in this period.<br />\nThe Black and Blue team started<br />\nthe second quarter by recovering a<br />\nfumble, thereby depriving the Hoboken eleven of an excellent opportunity to score. Hopkins was<br />\nunable to make any impression on<br />\nthe opponent's line, and was forced<br />\nto kick. The heavy ends, called<br />\ninto the backfield, were unable to<br />\nget started when they hit the<br />\nStevens line. Stevens attempted a<br />\nforward pass, but was unsuccessful.<br />\nNear the end of the second quarter,<br />\nTippett tried a drop-kick, but the<br />\nsoggy ground and wet ball allowed<br />\nof no success.

It is<br />\nin the uncomfortable position of a<br />\npossible recipient of charity. .<br />\nThere does not seem to be a<br />\nclearly-defined law in the Athletic<br />\nAssociation's constitution covering<br />\ncases of this kind.
