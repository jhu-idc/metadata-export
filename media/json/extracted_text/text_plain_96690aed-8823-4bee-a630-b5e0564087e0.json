The<br />\nAlumni celebration will commence<br />\non Friday evening, when the<br />\nAlumni and former students will<br />\nattend a smoker at the Hopkins<br />\nClub.<br />\nOn Saturday the main attraction<br />\nwill be a lacrosse frame between<br />\nHopkins, champions of the Southern Division, and either Toronto or<br />\nthe winner of the Northern Division championship. In either case<br />\na close and hard-fought battle may<br />\nbe expected. Toronto has always<br />\nbeen able to put a fast, well-trained<br />\nteam on the field, and from past<br />\nrecords will make Hopkins play the<br />\ngame of its life in order to win.<br />\nIf the game is arranged with the<br />\nNorthern League champions, Baltimore can expect to see one of the<br />\nbest contests ever played at Homewood; for the teams will be fighting<br />\nfor the Intercollegiate championship of the United States.<br />\nOn the afternoon of the game<br />\nHomewood will present a gay appearance. Several Alumni classes<br />\nwill march to the grounds with<br />\nbands, and to add to the gala affair<br />\na committee, headed by George M.<br />\nGillet, Jr., expects to raise four<br />\nflags\u2014the United States, the Johns<br />\nHopkins, the Maryland and the Baltimore City flags\u2014one at each corner of the field.<br />\nAfter the game the Alumni and<br />\nthe former students will hold an<br />\ninformal banquet on the roof garden of the Emerson. Dr. Eveleth<br />\nW.

The University will be closed<br />\non these three days, the students<br />\ntaking part in the general activities.<br />\nElaborate arrangements have<br />\nbeen made to make the inauguration and dedication the most notable<br />\noccasions in the history of the University. President Wilson, General<br />\nGoethals, ex-President Remsen and<br />\nDr. Henry Carter Adams will officially take part in the exercises,<br />\nwhile many other prominent men<br />\nwill be present among the two hundred and fifty guests who have been<br />\nespecially invited.<br />\nA stand with a seating-capacity<br />\nof five thousand will be erected facing the Academic Building, for the<br />\naccommodation of students and of<br />\nthe public at large. On the steps of<br />\nthe building a platform will be constructed, and \u2022here the new president of the University, the members of the Faculty and the invited<br />\nguests will be seated.<br />\nOn both Thursday and Friday<br />\nthere will be an academic procession, in which the Faculty, Trustees, guests and an accompanying<br />\nband of students will take part. A<br />\ncorps of student ushers will be appointed, whose task it will be to<br />\ntake charge of the seating of the<br />\nguests of the University.<br />\nThe exercises will be opened on<br />\nThursday at half-past four o'clock,<br />\nwhen the inauguration of President<br />\nGoodnow will take place. Ex-President Remsen will be the \u2022presiding<br />\nofficer of the occasion, and will present Dr. Goodnow to President R.<br />\nBrent Keyser, of the Board of<br />\nTrustees. Dr. Goodnow will be<br />\ngiven the University Charter and<br />\nthe key of the Carroll Mansion, by<br />\nvirtue of his position as guardian<br />\nand protector of the spirit and the<br />\npossessions of the University. The<br />\nnew president will then make an<br />\naddress, this being the only speech<br />\nto mark the ceremonies of the first<br />\nday. A reception will be held in<br />\n<br />\nThe complete list of notable educators and public men who will be<br />\npresent at President Goodnow's inauguration has not been announced,<br />\nbut it is certain that a large number<br />\nof the \"big men\" of the country<br />\nwill be on hand. It is practically<br />\nsure that Presidents Lowell, of Harvard; Hibben, of Princeton; Hadley, of Yale; Butler, of Columbia;<br />\nand Sherman, of Cornell, will be<br />\namong the guests. Dr. Adams,<br />\nfrom Michigan, the first graduate<br />\nfrom the Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nis to be a visitor especially honored,<br />\nand will make one of the principal<br />\naddresses of the ceremonies.<br />\nProfessor Ames and Dr. Magoffin have the invitations in charge,<br />\nand are constantly receiving acceptances from all over the country.<br />\nthe Academic Building at \u2022 nine<br />\no'clock on Thursday evening.<br />\nOn Friday the Technical School<br />\nand Gilman Hall will be dedicated.<br />\nThe formal dedication of the new<br />\nHopkins buildings at Homewood is,<br />\nindeed, a most important occasion,<br />\nmarking, as it does, the first step in<br />\nthe material growth and expansion<br />\nof the University. The ceremony<br />\nwill also serve as a reminder that<br />\nthe dream of all who are interested<br />\nin Johns Hopkins is very nearly<br />\nrealized, and that Homewood will<br />\nsoon be in fact, as well as in theory,<br />\nthe Hopkins campus.<br />\nPresident Wilson, who has accepted the invitation extended by<br />\nthe committee in charge, will make<br />\nthe opening address on Friday. The<br />\ninterest which President Wilson<br />\nwould naturally feel in Johns Hopkins as a prominent American institution of learning is of course augmented by the contributing circumstances that he is himself a J. H. U.<br />\nalumnus, and thus his presence at<br />\nthe ceremonies will be peculiarly<br />\nappropriate. The Technical School<br />\nwill be dedicated by Colonel Goethals, to whose engineering genius<br />\nthe Panama Canal is a lasting<br />\nmonument, while Dr. Henry Carter<br />\nAdams, the first Hopkins alumnus,<br />\nwill dedicate Gilman Hall.

President Wilson's<br />\naddress will be a brief general address, dedicating the buildings as a<br />\nwhole.<br />\nThe Engineering Building will be<br />\ndedicated by General George Washington Goethals, chief of engineers<br />\nduring the Spanish-American War,<br />\nmember of the Board of Fortifications, chief engineer of the Panama<br />\nCanal, and first Civil Governor of<br />\nthe Panama Canal Zone. General<br />\nGoethal's address will be given immediately after President Wilson's.<br />\nGilman Hall will be dedicated by<br />\nProfessor Henry Carter Adams,<br />\nPh. D., D.

Mills, who lectured<br />\nlast Thursday afternoon in McCoy<br />\nHall on \"The Progress and Prospects of China.\" He quoted the<br />\nsaying of John Hay, which is written beneath his portrait in Shanghai: \"Whoever understands the<br />\nChinese has the key to the world<br />\npolitics of the next five centuries.\"<br />\n\"The Chinese,\"he said,\"are as well<br />\nfitted for a republic as were our ancestors in 1776, but besides internal<br />\naffairs China has had to deal with<br />\nmany foreign problems. For many<br />\ncenturies, however, China has been<br />\nfar more democratic than those unacquainted with her history or literature could possibly believe.\"<br />\nDr. Mills enumerated some of the<br />\nremarkable achievements of the<br />\nChinese during over 37 centuries of<br />\nnational existence. Five hundred<br />\nyears before Gutenberg they were<br />\nprinting books by means of movable types, and the Peking Gazette<br />\nhas been continuously published<br />\nsince 713 A. D. Though they<br />\ndespised war the Chinese had powder and fire-arms as early as the<br />\nfirst Christian century. Town meetings of the New England character<br />\nwere held at a time when our ancestors were offering up burnt sacrifices. The present backwardness<br />\nof the people is due to their religious beliefs and superstitions.<br />\nPresident Eliot was quoted by Dr.<br />\nMills as saying that of all peoples<br />\nthe Chinese are physically the<br />\nstrongest, mentally the most intelligent, and morally the cleanest. In<br />\ncommerce they cannot be surpassed<br />\nfor shrewdness, yet they have permitted themselves to be checked in<br />\ntheir progress by a primitive belief<br />\nin spirits in air, earth and water.<br />\nThis, said the lecturer, is gradually<br />\nbeing overcome by the work of the<br />\nschools and the Christian missions.<br />\nSun Yat Sett, the organizer of the<br />\nrevolution, is a Christian and a<br />\nlarge majority of the statesmen are<br />\nof this religion. In the 42,000 Government schools seventy-five per<br />\ncent. of the text-books have been<br />\nprepared by the teachers or graduates of the Christian missions, and<br />\nit is partly because so many of the<br />\nmissionaries are Americans that the<br />\nUnited States holds first place in<br />\nthe hearts of the Chinese.

During the three days<br />\nwhich have been set aside for the<br />\ninauguration of our President and<br />\nthe dedication of the new buildings<br />\nat Homewood 'there will come to<br />\nthis city as guests of the University<br />\nprominent educators and men of the<br />\nhighest distinction, as well as many<br />\nalumni from all sections of the<br />\ncountfy. Many promising features<br />\nhave been provided for by those in<br />\ncharge, and the occasion will rank<br />\nin importance high among those<br />\nevents the history of which is treasured in the annals of the University.<br />\nThe exercises may be said to<br />\nmark the formal beginning of a<br />\nlong awaited new era in the history<br />\nof Johns Hopkins. With the inauguration of President Goodnow<br />\nthe affairs of the University are<br />\nplaced in the hands of a man who,<br />\nin the comparatively short space of<br />\ntime in which he has been connected<br />\nwith Johns Hopkins, has by virtue<br />\nof his strong personality won the<br />\nhigh esteem and respect of everyone at the University, and under<br />\n<br />\nwhose guidvice progress and prosperity seem imminent.. In the dedik.cation of the new buildings at<br />\nHomewood we see the first formal<br />\nmove towards the permanent establishment of the University at its<br />\nfuture site. In the reunion of the<br />\nalumni opportunity is afforded for<br />\nthe creation of a stronger spirit<br />\namong sons of Johns Hopkins, and<br />\nthe awakening of an even greater<br />\ninterest in the rapid strides which<br />\nthe University is making. The<br />\ncelebration,.taken as a whole, should<br />\ncertainly be an occasion for great<br />\npleasure on the part of all who are<br />\nat all interested in the progress of<br />\nthe University in this important<br />\nperiod of expansion.<br />\nThe presence of the distinguished<br />\nmen who have signified their intention of attending the ceremonies<br />\nshould alone prove of interest<br />\nenough to make the three days<br />\nworthy of being ranked among the<br />\nmost important in the life of the<br />\nUniversity. When such men as the<br />\nPresident of the United States,<br />\nGeneral Goethals, the man who was<br />\nthe prime force in the building of<br />\nthe Panama Canal, and the presidents of practically all of the important institutions of learning in<br />\nthe country, as well as many.alumni<br />\nwho have won distinction since their<br />\ngraduation, are willing to come together to join in the celebration of<br />\nan event, the fact becomes plain<br />\nthat that event is of extreme importance not only to the University,<br />\nbut tothose outsiders who have seen<br />\nfit to become interested in the University and its welfare.<br />\nWith acceptances to invitations<br />\ncoming in every day in large numbers, and with the excellent progress which ' the committees are<br />\nmaking in their work, nothing remains to be done except to await<br />\nthe time; and when it comes, to participate whole-heartedly in the celebration, joining in with the general<br />\nfeeling of good will towards our<br />\nnew president, and of joy at seeing<br />\nthe first strides of our expansion so<br />\nsuccessfully completed. The undergraduate body will be assigned a<br />\ndefinite and active part to take in<br />\nthe exercises; surely every Hopkins man will come forth with all<br />\nthe enthusiasm that is in him to<br />\nhelp celebrate this, the most \\important event at the University in<br />\nmany years.<br />\nThe Brady Institute.<br />\n<br />\nLast week marked the formal<br />\nopening of the latest addition to the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital: the James<br />\nBuchanan Brady Urological Institute. This building, which is said<br />\nto be the best equipped and most<br />\nup-to-date of its kind in this country, was made possible through the<br />\ngenerous gift of Mr. James Buchanan Brady, of New York, whose<br />\nname it bears. Mr. Brady consulted<br />\nwith Dr. Hugh Hampton Young, of<br />\nthis University, with reference to<br />\nmaking plans for the construction<br />\nof a building to be devoted to the<br />\nstudy of urology, and asked him to<br />\n<br />\nname the cost of such an enterprise,<br />\nstating that he wished to give the<br />\nmoney to carry it through. Dr.<br />\nYoung furnished plans, and estimated the cost at $600,000. This<br />\namount Mr. Brady gave immediately and willingly.<br />\nApart from the fact that the work<br />\nwhich is now in progress as a result of his generosity gives Mr.<br />\nBrady himself no mean degree of<br />\npleasure, as was distinctly shown<br />\nby his speech at .the dedication, the<br />\nestablishment of the Institute marks<br />\nthe .beginning of greater advancement along lines of research in a<br />\nmost important field of medical<br />\nwork. The work of Dr. Hugh<br />\nYoung at the Johns Hopkins Hospital has long been appreciated, and,<br />\nbesides gaining for him a most enviable reputation in medical circles,<br />\nhas won him scores of staunch<br />\nfriends, among whom Mr. Brady is<br />\none who has given evidence of his<br />\nfriendship in this most gratifying<br />\nmanner. Mr. Brady's gift has made<br />\nit possible for Dr. Young to further this work 'along lines which<br />\nwould in all probability have been<br />\nwell-nigh impossible of attack without the splendid equipment which<br />\nthe Institute affords.<br />\nCertainly Johns Hopkins is deeply<br />\nindebted to Mr. Brady, and to show<br />\nits gratitude can only hope to offer<br />\nthe work done at the Institute. Not<br />\nonly has Mr. Brady increased the<br />\nscope of work at the Medical<br />\nSchool and Hospital, thereby giving<br />\nJohns Hopkins a distinct advantage<br />\namong medical schools, but he has<br />\nprovided means for reducing suffering among patients to a minimum, and thus has established<br />\nthrough his splendid philanthropy<br />\nan Institute which for years to come<br />\nwill undoubtedly play an important<br />\npart in the good work for which<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital is<br />\nnoted.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER takes this occasion to wish Dr. Young the best<br />\npossible success in his work as head<br />\nof the Institute, and, with the entire University, feels that time will<br />\nshow Mr. Brady's gift to have been<br />\nmost worthily bestowed.<br />\nPlana for Gilman Memorial.<br />\n<br />\nBefore the inaugural exercises at<br />\nHomewood, nothing will be done in<br />\nregard to Gilman Memorial, the essentially memorial feature of Gilman Hall.

Mills, who lectured<br />\nlast Thursday afternoon in McCoy<br />\nHall on \"The Progress and Prospects of China.\" He quoted the<br />\nsaying of John Hay, which is written beneath his portrait in Shanghai: \"Whoever understands the<br />\nChinese has the key to the world<br />\npolitics of the next five centuries.\"<br />\n\"The Chinese,\"he said,\"are as well<br />\nfitted for a republic as were our ancestors in 1776, but besides internal<br />\naffairs China has had to deal with<br />\nmany foreign problems. For many<br />\ncenturies, however, China has been<br />\nfar more democratic than those unacquainted with her history or literature could possibly believe.\"<br />\nDr. Mills enumerated some of the<br />\nremarkable achievements of the<br />\nChinese during over 37 centuries of<br />\nnational existence. Five hundred<br />\nyears before Gutenberg they were<br />\nprinting books by means of movable types, and the Peking Gazette<br />\nhas been continuously published<br />\nsince 713 A. D. Though they<br />\ndespised war the Chinese had powder and fire-arms as early as the<br />\nfirst Christian century. Town meetings of the New England character<br />\nwere held at a time when our ancestors were offering up burnt sacrifices. The present backwardness<br />\nof the people is due to their religious beliefs and superstitions.<br />\nPresident Eliot was quoted by Dr.<br />\nMills as saying that of all peoples<br />\nthe Chinese are physically the<br />\nstrongest, mentally the most intelligent, and morally the cleanest. In<br />\ncommerce they cannot be surpassed<br />\nfor shrewdness, yet they have permitted themselves to be checked in<br />\ntheir progress by a primitive belief<br />\nin spirits in air, earth and water.<br />\nThis, said the lecturer, is gradually<br />\nbeing overcome by the work of the<br />\nschools and the Christian missions.<br />\nSun Yat Sett, the organizer of the<br />\nrevolution, is a Christian and a<br />\nlarge majority of the statesmen are<br />\nof this religion. In the 42,000 Government schools seventy-five per<br />\ncent. of the text-books have been<br />\nprepared by the teachers or graduates of the Christian missions, and<br />\nit is partly because so many of the<br />\nmissionaries are Americans that the<br />\nUnited States holds first place in<br />\nthe hearts of the Chinese. We must<br />\nnot lose our hold upon the Chinese,<br />\nfor up to this time, concluded Dr.<br />\nMills, \"New China has been made<br />\nin America.\"<br /><br />\nOF<br />\nFALL<br />\nSIGNS KINDS<br /><br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br /><br />\nTHE SIGN SHOP<br /><br />\nENGRAVER \u2014 PRINTER \u2014 STATIONER<br />\n229 N.

The<br />\ncelebration,.taken as a whole, should<br />\ncertainly be an occasion for great<br />\npleasure on the part of all who are<br />\nat all interested in the progress of<br />\nthe University in this important<br />\nperiod of expansion.<br />\nThe presence of the distinguished<br />\nmen who have signified their intention of attending the ceremonies<br />\nshould alone prove of interest<br />\nenough to make the three days<br />\nworthy of being ranked among the<br />\nmost important in the life of the<br />\nUniversity. When such men as the<br />\nPresident of the United States,<br />\nGeneral Goethals, the man who was<br />\nthe prime force in the building of<br />\nthe Panama Canal, and the presidents of practically all of the important institutions of learning in<br />\nthe country, as well as many.alumni<br />\nwho have won distinction since their<br />\ngraduation, are willing to come together to join in the celebration of<br />\nan event, the fact becomes plain<br />\nthat that event is of extreme importance not only to the University,<br />\nbut tothose outsiders who have seen<br />\nfit to become interested in the University and its welfare.<br />\nWith acceptances to invitations<br />\ncoming in every day in large numbers, and with the excellent progress which ' the committees are<br />\nmaking in their work, nothing remains to be done except to await<br />\nthe time; and when it comes, to participate whole-heartedly in the celebration, joining in with the general<br />\nfeeling of good will towards our<br />\nnew president, and of joy at seeing<br />\nthe first strides of our expansion so<br />\nsuccessfully completed. The undergraduate body will be assigned a<br />\ndefinite and active part to take in<br />\nthe exercises; surely every Hopkins man will come forth with all<br />\nthe enthusiasm that is in him to<br />\nhelp celebrate this, the most \\important event at the University in<br />\nmany years.<br />\nThe Brady Institute.<br /><br />\nLast week marked the formal<br />\nopening of the latest addition to the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Hospital: the James<br />\nBuchanan Brady Urological Institute. This building, which is said<br />\nto be the best equipped and most<br />\nup-to-date of its kind in this country, was made possible through the<br />\ngenerous gift of Mr. James Buchanan Brady, of New York, whose<br />\nname it bears. Mr. Brady consulted<br />\nwith Dr. Hugh Hampton Young, of<br />\nthis University, with reference to<br />\nmaking plans for the construction<br />\nof a building to be devoted to the<br />\nstudy of urology, and asked him to<br /><br />\nname the cost of such an enterprise,<br />\nstating that he wished to give the<br />\nmoney to carry it through. Dr.<br />\nYoung furnished plans, and estimated the cost at $600,000. This<br />\namount Mr. Brady gave immediately and willingly.<br />\nApart from the fact that the work<br />\nwhich is now in progress as a result of his generosity gives Mr.<br />\nBrady himself no mean degree of<br />\npleasure, as was distinctly shown<br />\nby his speech at .the dedication, the<br />\nestablishment of the Institute marks<br />\nthe .beginning of greater advancement along lines of research in a<br />\nmost important field of medical<br />\nwork. The work of Dr. Hugh<br />\nYoung at the Johns Hopkins Hospital has long been appreciated, and,<br />\nbesides gaining for him a most enviable reputation in medical circles,<br />\nhas won him scores of staunch<br />\nfriends, among whom Mr. Brady is<br />\none who has given evidence of his<br />\nfriendship in this most gratifying<br />\nmanner. Mr. Brady's gift has made<br />\nit possible for Dr. Young to further this work 'along lines which<br />\nwould in all probability have been<br />\nwell-nigh impossible of attack without the splendid equipment which<br />\nthe Institute affords.<br />\nCertainly Johns Hopkins is deeply<br />\nindebted to Mr. Brady, and to show<br />\nits gratitude can only hope to offer<br />\nthe work done at the Institute. Not<br />\nonly has Mr. Brady increased the<br />\nscope of work at the Medical<br />\nSchool and Hospital, thereby giving<br />\nJohns Hopkins a distinct advantage<br />\namong medical schools, but he has<br />\nprovided means for reducing suffering among patients to a minimum, and thus has established<br />\nthrough his splendid philanthropy<br />\nan Institute which for years to come<br />\nwill undoubtedly play an important<br />\npart in the good work for which<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins Hospital is<br />\nnoted.<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER takes this occasion to wish Dr. Young the best<br />\npossible success in his work as head<br />\nof the Institute, and, with the entire University, feels that time will<br />\nshow Mr. Brady's gift to have been<br />\nmost worthily bestowed.<br />\nPlana for Gilman Memorial.<br /><br />\nBefore the inaugural exercises at<br />\nHomewood, nothing will be done in<br />\nregard to Gilman Memorial, the essentially memorial feature of Gilman Hall. Funds for this memorial were secured by a bequest from<br />\nMrs. Gilman in 1910, and, although<br />\nmany plans for the memorial have<br /><br />\nUNIVERSITY CALENDAR<br />\nTuesday, May 11<br />\n8.30 P.
