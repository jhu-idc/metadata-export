CHARLES ST.<br />\n<br />\nPrinters of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins News-Letter<br />\n<br />\nMany of the men whose names are writ large<br />\nin engineering history are design engineers; men<br />\n<br />\nlike Westinghouse, Lamme, Stanley, Hodgkinson, Tesla, Shallenberger. Their inventions<br />\nhave the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of<br />\nproductability; which is an involved way, perhaps, of saying that they have the primary<br />\nrequisite of all really great inventions:<br />\nServiceability.<br />\n<br />\nEngineering history abounds in instances of<br />\nnear-genius that produced no product, and of<br />\ngreat developments that never reached completion; and most of these instances are explained<br />\nby the lack, somewhere in the system, of that<br />\nability to give real Service.<br />\nService, in a machine or a system, or wherever<br />\nyou find it, is not there by accident but because<br />\nit was incorporated by men who understood<br />\nwhat was required and knew how to provide it.<br />\nMuch more is required of the designer than<br />\nfacility in calculation and mastery of theory.<br />\nHe must have first hand and thorough familiarity<br />\nwith manufacturing operations and with commercial and operating conditions. It takes more<br />\nthan mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design<br />\napparatus that will be really serviceable and<br />\nwill \"stay put.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe design engineer, in the Westinghouse<br />\nplan, is responsible for the performance of the<br />\nfinished product. He cannot possibly have the<br />\nproper understanding of operation unless he operates and tests, unless he spends time and thought<br />\nin investigation and study, not in the laboratory<br />\nor drawing room, but right on the operating<br />\njob. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and<br />\nhere he will see and prepare for all the different<br />\nthings which the product will later have to<br />\nencounter. Then when he comes to put hiQ<br />\ncreations on paper, his calculations will be<br />\nnecessary and helpful to check the conclusions<br />\nwhich he has reached, and this right use of them<br />\nrequires training and a high degree of understanding. This proper balance of the physical<br />\nand mathematical conception of things is what<br />\nconstitutes engineering judgement.<br />\nIt should be thoroughly understood that the<br />\nprimary function of the design engineer is the<br />\nconception and the production of new or improved apparatus, and familiarity with the<br />\npractical is essential to the proper discharge of<br />\nthis duty.<br />\nIt is this view of designing that makes this<br />\nbranch of Westinghouse engineering so important, so effective, and so productive of real<br />\ndevelopments.<br />\n<br />\nlifestinghouse<br />\n44000<br />\nCollege Literature<br />\nLOMBARD and SOUTH STREETS<br />\n<br />\nActivities<br />\n<br />\nACHIEVEMENT8 OPPORTUNITY<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "ds,<br />\ns,<br /><br />\nlor<br /><br />\n'S<br /><br />\nTOL.

CHARLES ST.<br /><br />\nPrinters of the<br />\nJohns Hopkins News-Letter<br /><br />\nMany of the men whose names are writ large<br />\nin engineering history are design engineers; men<br /><br />\nlike Westinghouse, Lamme, Stanley, Hodgkinson, Tesla, Shallenberger. Their inventions<br />\nhave the quality of usefulness, of reliability, of<br />\nproductability; which is an involved way, perhaps, of saying that they have the primary<br />\nrequisite of all really great inventions:<br />\nServiceability.<br /><br />\nEngineering history abounds in instances of<br />\nnear-genius that produced no product, and of<br />\ngreat developments that never reached completion; and most of these instances are explained<br />\nby the lack, somewhere in the system, of that<br />\nability to give real Service.<br />\nService, in a machine or a system, or wherever<br />\nyou find it, is not there by accident but because<br />\nit was incorporated by men who understood<br />\nwhat was required and knew how to provide it.<br />\nMuch more is required of the designer than<br />\nfacility in calculation and mastery of theory.<br />\nHe must have first hand and thorough familiarity<br />\nwith manufacturing operations and with commercial and operating conditions. It takes more<br />\nthan mere ingenuity and inventiveness to design<br />\napparatus that will be really serviceable and<br />\nwill \"stay put.\"<br /><br />\nThe design engineer, in the Westinghouse<br />\nplan, is responsible for the performance of the<br />\nfinished product. He cannot possibly have the<br />\nproper understanding of operation unless he operates and tests, unless he spends time and thought<br />\nin investigation and study, not in the laboratory<br />\nor drawing room, but right on the operating<br />\njob. Here, most of his ideas will develop; and<br />\nhere he will see and prepare for all the different<br />\nthings which the product will later have to<br />\nencounter. Then when he comes to put hiQ<br />\ncreations on paper, his calculations will be<br />\nnecessary and helpful to check the conclusions<br />\nwhich he has reached, and this right use of them<br />\nrequires training and a high degree of understanding. This proper balance of the physical<br />\nand mathematical conception of things is what<br />\nconstitutes engineering judgement.<br />\nIt should be thoroughly understood that the<br />\nprimary function of the design engineer is the<br />\nconception and the production of new or improved apparatus, and familiarity with the<br />\npractical is essential to the proper discharge of<br />\nthis duty.<br />\nIt is this view of designing that makes this<br />\nbranch of Westinghouse engineering so important, so effective, and so productive of real<br />\ndevelopments.<br /><br />\nlifestinghouse<br />\n44000<br />\nCollege Literature<br />\nLOMBARD and SOUTH STREETS<br /><br />\nActivities<br /><br />\nACHIEVEMENT8 OPPORTUNITY<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37653, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "1b542bd5-8769-4b1d-a84a-cf1367337bf8", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13016-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13016, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "09be600c-2c1e-4143-98e4-e05d6b905e3d", "url": "/node/13016"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "4e70fb09-07b4-4b7f-9706-ee72e1590838"}]}
