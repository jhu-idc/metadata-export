Taking up the profession<br />\nof teaching, he entered upon that<br />\ncareer which has placed him, for<br />\nthe present, in the position of dean<br />\nof the North Carolina institution.<br />\nHe chose his.alma mater, the Northwestern University, for his first experience as an instructor in English. At the University of Chicago<br />\nfrom 1904 to 1907, at Harvard in<br />\n1910-11, and at Adelphi College,<br />\nBrooklyn, N. Y., he pursued his<br />\nchosen profession. In 1913 he became a professor of English and<br />\nin 1918 he accepted the office which<br />\nhe now holds as Dean of the Graduate School of the University of<br />\nNorth Carolina.

He had<br />\na funny way, too, of strewing his<br />\njoints over the floor and gathering<br />\nthem up again. But it took a long<br />\ntime for the applause to subside.<br />\nUrner played a couple of pieces<br />\non his inspired banjo and then<br />\nSteinwald launched one of his<br />\nwhirlwind attacks upon the keys<br />\nand produced such showers and ripples of notes that it was a minute<br />\nWell Known as Author<br />\nor so before anybody could disTeaching,<br />\nhowever, is not the<br />\ncover he was playing \"I Wonder<br />\nWhat's Become of Sally?\" Soon only field in which Professor Greenthe banjo and saxophone burst in law has made himself known.

Some have gone so far as to<br />\nattribute seeming lack of spirit to the existence of this condition.<br />\nThis, of course, may or may not be true. Nevertheless, it is logical<br />\n'to suppose that a certain feeling of reverence and inspiration among<br />\nthe Alumni would be enlivened if they could see in the University<br />\nof the present, the customs which they recall from their own college<br />\ndays. A custom which has been in force for a long time naturally<br />\nacquires respect, and the greater the age the more respect it will<br />\nacquire, since man believes quite properly, that wrong will not persist for ages.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is young, it is true. But this excuse has been<br />\noverworked. For a university which has been in existence for nearly<br />\na half century and which commands a towering position among institutions of advanced learning, there is little reason why tradition<br />\nshould be conspicuous by its absence. Even though undergraduate<br />\nHopkins has not been emphasized, it has not been neglected. Yet,<br />\nIn the establishment of tradition there are criteria of judgment which<br />\nshould be applied, lest custom becomes merely a useless survival of<br />\nprimitive times. Even the most venerable tradition should be able<br />\nto bear the pragmatic test, \"Will it work?\" Two standards applicable to custom are those of expediency and of common sense. If the<br />\ntradition will correlate with the life, habits, and conditions of the<br />\npresent and serve the purpose for which it is founded, if it is the outgrowth of some demand, the answer to some need in college life, it is<br />\n'amply justified.<br />\nThe News-Letter withholds its opinion of the traditions of parades and bonfires before important games, the attempt of the Musical Club to establish the custom of having its annual home concert<br />\nthe evening before or the evening of Commemoration Day, and<br />\nothers. However, the value of tradition, if it passes the tests, is<br />\nenormous and efforts towards establishment of tradition should be<br />\nencouraged. In order that traditional dates may be kept free from<br />\nconfliction, the News-Letter offers the following suggestion for consideration of the University authorities.<br />\nA CAMPUS CALENDAR<br />\nMaintenance of a campus calendar sems warranted by a repeated<br />\noccurrence of conflicting dates. Instances of this nature, luckily,<br />\n'nave been few. Yet, one case in particular has attracted campus attention, the scheduling .of the annual home concert of the Musical<br />\n'Club and the Hopkins-Fifth Regiment Games for February 23rd.<br />\nLast year a similar tie-up was experienced which resulted in the Musical Club changing three times the date set for its performance. The<br />\n(managers of the Musical Club, recalling the unpleasant entanglement<br />\nlast year, endeavored to avoid a repetition of it by consulting the athletic authorities early in the fall. At the time, this date being open<br />\nto both parties, the concert was booked for February 23rd. Then the<br />\nindoor meet was scheduled for the same date. To the outside world<br />\na condition of this kind would naturally indicate internal friction between campus activities. Hence, would it not be wise to adopt a<br />\ncampus calendar and compel every activity to obtain permission for<br />\ndates? In order that it may be effective, the calendar would have<br />\nto be maintained by the faculty, since the faculty alone exercises authority over all activities, both athletic and non-athletic.<br />\n<br />\nArchives yield up accounts of one of the first Fellows enrolled<br />\nthe past, the \"Poets' Corner\" of at this University.<br />\nDamon\u2014<br />\n\"What are you doing, Pyth\u2014<br />\nManuscript writings of Mark<br />\nWestminster Abbey is a hall of<br />\nwriting Her another letter?\"<br />\nfame for poets alone, but the min- Twain, a specimen from \"EuroPythias\u2014<br />\n\"No\u2014not this time.

The<br />\nstudent should do a great deal of<br />\noutside reading, particularly in<br />\nhis \"major\", 'which should become his hobby. Although text<br />\nbook assignments represent the<br />\nminimum work required, the<br />\nstudent must usually be driven to<br />\naccomplish that much. Because<br />\nof this attitude of the student<br />\nbody towards courses of study,<br />\nthe instructors find it necessary<br />\nto give tests and examinations.<br />\nAs an illustration of what interest in a subject can accomplish<br />\nDr. Mitchell told of a young man<br />\nwho, having reached college after<br />\ngreat scholastic difficulty, was<br />\nfailing because he looked upon<br />\nstudy as a very disagreeable task.<br />\nThrough chance this fellow became interested in bees, and began to keep them for honey. He<br />\nwas so absorbed in bee keeping<br />\nthat he was transferred to an agricultural college to study the<br />\nsubject.

Some have gone so far as to<br />\nattribute seeming lack of spirit to the existence of this condition.<br />\nThis, of course, may or may not be true. Nevertheless, it is logical<br />\n'to suppose that a certain feeling of reverence and inspiration among<br />\nthe Alumni would be enlivened if they could see in the University<br />\nof the present, the customs which they recall from their own college<br />\ndays. A custom which has been in force for a long time naturally<br />\nacquires respect, and the greater the age the more respect it will<br />\nacquire, since man believes quite properly, that wrong will not persist for ages.<br />\nJohns Hopkins is young, it is true. But this excuse has been<br />\noverworked. For a university which has been in existence for nearly<br />\na half century and which commands a towering position among institutions of advanced learning, there is little reason why tradition<br />\nshould be conspicuous by its absence. Even though undergraduate<br />\nHopkins has not been emphasized, it has not been neglected. Yet,<br />\nIn the establishment of tradition there are criteria of judgment which<br />\nshould be applied, lest custom becomes merely a useless survival of<br />\nprimitive times. Even the most venerable tradition should be able<br />\nto bear the pragmatic test, \"Will it work?\" Two standards applicable to custom are those of expediency and of common sense. If the<br />\ntradition will correlate with the life, habits, and conditions of the<br />\npresent and serve the purpose for which it is founded, if it is the outgrowth of some demand, the answer to some need in college life, it is<br />\n'amply justified.<br />\nThe News-Letter withholds its opinion of the traditions of parades and bonfires before important games, the attempt of the Musical Club to establish the custom of having its annual home concert<br />\nthe evening before or the evening of Commemoration Day, and<br />\nothers. However, the value of tradition, if it passes the tests, is<br />\nenormous and efforts towards establishment of tradition should be<br />\nencouraged. In order that traditional dates may be kept free from<br />\nconfliction, the News-Letter offers the following suggestion for consideration of the University authorities.<br />\nA CAMPUS CALENDAR<br />\nMaintenance of a campus calendar sems warranted by a repeated<br />\noccurrence of conflicting dates. Instances of this nature, luckily,<br />\n'nave been few. Yet, one case in particular has attracted campus attention, the scheduling .of the annual home concert of the Musical<br />\n'Club and the Hopkins-Fifth Regiment Games for February 23rd.<br />\nLast year a similar tie-up was experienced which resulted in the Musical Club changing three times the date set for its performance. The<br />\n(managers of the Musical Club, recalling the unpleasant entanglement<br />\nlast year, endeavored to avoid a repetition of it by consulting the athletic authorities early in the fall. At the time, this date being open<br />\nto both parties, the concert was booked for February 23rd. Then the<br />\nindoor meet was scheduled for the same date. To the outside world<br />\na condition of this kind would naturally indicate internal friction between campus activities. Hence, would it not be wise to adopt a<br />\ncampus calendar and compel every activity to obtain permission for<br />\ndates? In order that it may be effective, the calendar would have<br />\nto be maintained by the faculty, since the faculty alone exercises authority over all activities, both athletic and non-athletic.<br /><br />\nArchives yield up accounts of one of the first Fellows enrolled<br />\nthe past, the \"Poets' Corner\" of at this University.<br />\nDamon\u2014<br />\n\"What are you doing, Pyth\u2014<br />\nManuscript writings of Mark<br />\nWestminster Abbey is a hall of<br />\nwriting Her another letter?\"<br />\nfame for poets alone, but the min- Twain, a specimen from \"EuroPythias\u2014<br />\n\"No\u2014not this time.

The<br />\nstudent should do a great deal of<br />\noutside reading, particularly in<br />\nhis \"major\", 'which should become his hobby. Although text<br />\nbook assignments represent the<br />\nminimum work required, the<br />\nstudent must usually be driven to<br />\naccomplish that much.
