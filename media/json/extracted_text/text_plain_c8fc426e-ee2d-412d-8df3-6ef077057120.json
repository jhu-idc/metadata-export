This proposal is very ingenious. Lovers<br />\nof tradition are satisfied by the assurance that regulations will<br />\ngo on as usual, while the disagreeable element of paddling is<br />\neliminated. The plan has only one drawback; it won't work.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the \"moral suasion\" which is substituted<br />\nfor the strong arm methods of the past would not be just as effective. The difficulty lies in creating an attitude on the campus<br />\nthat would exercise this \"moral suasion.\" Such a state of mind<br />\ndoes not exist now; and it cannot be created by issuing an edict.<br />\nThe proposed plan appears to be a compromise between the<br />\nideas that paddling is bad and that regulations are good. Nothing<br />\ncould be worse for the campus morale than the laying down of<br />\nrules which would not be followed. What is needed is not a compromise, but a definite choice. Either strict enforcement of regulations should be provided for, or they should be abolished. Separate provisions, however, might be made for the rules calling<br />\nfor attendance at games, and participation in activities. With this<br />\nexception, there is no practical middle course.<br />\n<br />\nmbassy<br />\nE<br />\n<br />\n\"YES and NO\"<br />\n<br />\nTHEATRE<br />\n<br />\n\u201cJust Around the Corner from City Hall Plaza\"<br />\n<br />\nBY WAY OF APPRECIATION<br />\nDear Toots,<br />\nDo you know, Toots, that right few girls, particularly ones<br />\nof your wholly delightful type, and allowing myself to be accusative, scarcely ever send any thing more moving internally that an<br />\nengraved Christmas card?

The advertisement goes on to<br />\nsay that \"The 'Blue Jays' are graduates of J. H. U., Class of '26.\"<br />\nIt is our opinion that this is advertising under false pretenses.

M. C. A. Conference's<br />\nAttitude Defended<br />\nBy Local President<br />\nBy ROBERT L. BULL<br />\nMuch has been reported in criticism of the Milwaukee Conference<br />\nand yet there are several things of<br />\na positive and constructive nature<br />\nto be said about it.<br />\n1. The attitude of the conterence was distinctly unfavorable to<br />\nthe nationalistic policies of our government, and, especially unfavorable<br />\nwith regard to the militaristic program employed in carrying out this<br />\npolicy. A great number of foreign<br />\nstudents were present, representatives of every nation in the world<br />\nof any size. The endorsement of<br />\nthe views of the conference by three<br />\nthousand American youths will certainly tend to produce an attitude of<br />\ngood-will towards our country on<br />\nthe part of these foreign students.<br />\n<br />\nJAY TO BE INNOVATION<br />\n<br />\nto be found in the world today. The<br />\nmedieval, \"Santa Claus\" conception<br />\nof God, was attributed to the conference only by the \"Menckenites\"<br />\npresent. Suffice it to say, they had<br />\nnothing better to offer. Substantially, the view adhered to by the<br />\ndelegates was that God is a loving<br />\nPersonality at work in an orderly<br />\nUniverse and, that men could be coworkers with Him or sharers in the<br />\ngreat process of creation.<br />\nIn our attempt to understand this<br />\nprocess it was held that there was<br />\nno conflict between science. and religion. One supplements the other;<br />\nhut, one used without the other is<br />\nnecessarily limiting our capacities<br />\nand opportunities to bring about a<br />\nnew social order.<br />\n5. It is safe to say that the benefits of the conference will be widely felt and shared. \"There are none<br />\nSo blind as those who will not see.\"<br />\nThe conference had nothing to offer to that type of student. Its program was an honest attempt to meet<br />\ncertain needs of the youth in America and its success will be most<br />\nlargely measured by its influence on<br />\nthe lives it touched.<br />\n<br />\nHILL'S SWIMMING LESSON<br />\n<br />\nContinued from Page 4, Col. 3<br />\nContinued from Page 1, Col. 1<br />\nMRS.

The difficult problem of racial relationships, was undertaken<br />\nin a spirit of sympathy with an earnest desire to change prevailing attitudes of prejudice and discrimination. It was pointed out that we<br />\nmust remove the stigma of inferiority, which we have -assumed towards other races, in order to cooperate with them effectively in promoting a desirable program of social reform.<br />\n3. The conference accomplished<br />\nthe hitherto unattainable, namely,<br />\nthe articulation of widespread student opinion on the major issues of<br />\nboth student and national life.<br />\nMoreover, the smug complacency<br />\nand narrow provincialism of isolated student bodies disappeared in<br />\nthe presence of such a representative student gathering. One was<br />\nforced to revise many opinions<br />\nabout student life in the light of<br />\ndiscussion between men from widely scattered universities.<br />\n4. In the opinion of the majority, the conference voiced the most<br />\npromising and intelligent.view; concerning religion and science that are<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nWhat he didn't learn<br />\nat college<br />\n<br />\nIn his class work,<br />\n<br />\n\"What's thefuture with a<br />\n<br />\nLawrence Day<br />\nHowell, Princeton, Litt.

This proposal is very ingenious. Lovers<br />\nof tradition are satisfied by the assurance that regulations will<br />\ngo on as usual, while the disagreeable element of paddling is<br />\neliminated. The plan has only one drawback; it won't work.<br />\nThere is no doubt that the \"moral suasion\" which is substituted<br />\nfor the strong arm methods of the past would not be just as effective. The difficulty lies in creating an attitude on the campus<br />\nthat would exercise this \"moral suasion.\" Such a state of mind<br />\ndoes not exist now; and it cannot be created by issuing an edict.<br />\nThe proposed plan appears to be a compromise between the<br />\nideas that paddling is bad and that regulations are good. Nothing<br />\ncould be worse for the campus morale than the laying down of<br />\nrules which would not be followed. What is needed is not a compromise, but a definite choice. Either strict enforcement of regulations should be provided for, or they should be abolished. Separate provisions, however, might be made for the rules calling<br />\nfor attendance at games, and participation in activities.

M. C. A. Conference's<br />\nAttitude Defended<br />\nBy Local President<br />\nBy ROBERT L. BULL<br />\nMuch has been reported in criticism of the Milwaukee Conference<br />\nand yet there are several things of<br />\na positive and constructive nature<br />\nto be said about it.<br />\n1. The attitude of the conterence was distinctly unfavorable to<br />\nthe nationalistic policies of our government, and, especially unfavorable<br />\nwith regard to the militaristic program employed in carrying out this<br />\npolicy. A great number of foreign<br />\nstudents were present, representatives of every nation in the world<br />\nof any size. The endorsement of<br />\nthe views of the conference by three<br />\nthousand American youths will certainly tend to produce an attitude of<br />\ngood-will towards our country on<br />\nthe part of these foreign students.<br /><br />\nJAY TO BE INNOVATION<br /><br />\nto be found in the world today. The<br />\nmedieval, \"Santa Claus\" conception<br />\nof God, was attributed to the conference only by the \"Menckenites\"<br />\npresent. Suffice it to say, they had<br />\nnothing better to offer. Substantially, the view adhered to by the<br />\ndelegates was that God is a loving<br />\nPersonality at work in an orderly<br />\nUniverse and, that men could be coworkers with Him or sharers in the<br />\ngreat process of creation.<br />\nIn our attempt to understand this<br />\nprocess it was held that there was<br />\nno conflict between science. and religion. One supplements the other;<br />\nhut, one used without the other is<br />\nnecessarily limiting our capacities<br />\nand opportunities to bring about a<br />\nnew social order.<br />\n5. It is safe to say that the benefits of the conference will be widely felt and shared. \"There are none<br />\nSo blind as those who will not see.\"<br />\nThe conference had nothing to offer to that type of student. Its program was an honest attempt to meet<br />\ncertain needs of the youth in America and its success will be most<br />\nlargely measured by its influence on<br />\nthe lives it touched.<br /><br />\nHILL'S SWIMMING LESSON<br /><br />\nContinued from Page 4, Col. 3<br />\nContinued from Page 1, Col. 1<br />\nMRS.

The difficult problem of racial relationships, was undertaken<br />\nin a spirit of sympathy with an earnest desire to change prevailing attitudes of prejudice and discrimination. It was pointed out that we<br />\nmust remove the stigma of inferiority, which we have -assumed towards other races, in order to cooperate with them effectively in promoting a desirable program of social reform.<br />\n3. The conference accomplished<br />\nthe hitherto unattainable, namely,<br />\nthe articulation of widespread student opinion on the major issues of<br />\nboth student and national life.<br />\nMoreover, the smug complacency<br />\nand narrow provincialism of isolated student bodies disappeared in<br />\nthe presence of such a representative student gathering. One was<br />\nforced to revise many opinions<br />\nabout student life in the light of<br />\ndiscussion between men from widely scattered universities.<br />\n4.
