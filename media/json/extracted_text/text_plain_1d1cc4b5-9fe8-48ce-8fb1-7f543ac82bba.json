This opinion<br />\nWas expressed by Fred DeKuyper, campus representative of<br />\nthe pristine periodical, who<br />\nadded that this is also the<br />\nOpinion of his bosses in Chicago.<br />\nConcerning the threatened<br />\nlawsuit against Roland Blantz,<br />\nChairman of the dance and<br />\nagainst the Cotillion Board and<br />\nthe Booster Club. DeKuyper<br />\nstated that no suit was ever<br />\ndrawn up and none is contemplated in the future. DeKuyper<br />\nexplained that Playboy had told<br />\nBlantz that he would be sued<br />\n<br />\nfor infringement of copyright if<br />\na hired model were given the<br />\ntitle \"Miss playboy\" or \"Miss<br />\nPlaymate.\" DeKuyper said he<br />\nknew all along that Blantz would<br />\nnot go through with the announced plans, but that if by<br />\nsome chance Blantz had not retreated from his position, Playboy would have withdraWn permission to use their decorations<br />\nat the dance, and then Blantz<br />\nwould not only have been sued<br />\nfor infringement, but also for<br />\nunauthorized use of decorations.<br />\nDeKuyper told the N-L that<br />\nhe had attended the dance and<br />\nsaid that it seemed to be a fine<br />\naffair, but he was treated with<br />\n(Continued on Page 2)<br />\n<br />\nbrought to the attention of the<br />\nColonel, with the opinion added<br />\nto it, that such a discussion had<br />\nno place in the classroom.<br />\nHowever, Cadet Colonel Mal<br />\nBuchner expressed the feeling<br />\nthat \"there is nothing discussed<br />\nin class not pertinent to the<br />\nwelfare of the ROTC Department. Since the Military Ball is<br />\nan important activity of the<br />\nCorps, even though it is a social<br />\nactivity, a discussion of it during class was certainly not a<br />\nwaste of time, but in fact enabled us to plan for a more successful dance.\"<br />\n<br />\nHONOR<br />\nAs a result of violations reported just before and during<br />\nthe spring examination<br />\nperiod, the Honor Commission<br />\nconducted four trials.

Of the<br />\nthree hundred interviewed, about<br />\n200 were dorm students and the<br />\nremainder were chosen at random from the cafeteria at Levering Hall. The faculty were<br />\nfrom six departments: Classics,<br />\nEnglish, Electrical Engineering,<br />\nBiology, History and Psychology.<br />\nThe students were asked to answer the questionaire whether<br />\nthey had made a choice or not,<br />\nwhile the faculty questionaire<br />\nwas distributed through the mail,<br />\nwith only a small percentage<br />\nanswering.<br />\nFive Questions<br />\nThe questionaire asked five<br />\ndifferent questions.

Already, Goucher College has<br />\nhad two major speakers come to her campus: the great<br />\nhistorian, Eric Goldman, and the eternal leader of the<br />\nSocialist party, Norman Thomas. Its political activities,<br />\nboth on and off the Towson campus, have been such as<br />\nto cause the Goucher Weekly to editorialize its compliments for the students' enthusiasm, while our so-called<br />\npolitical groups have done comparatively little as Hopkins<br />\norganizations. Last year, the whole of Goucher's assembly<br />\nprogram for the year was devoted to searching explorations of urban problems, as she attracted a number of<br />\nextremely competent speakers.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nThis is not meant to be a general glorification of<br />\nGoucher College to the detriment of Hopkins; it is meant<br />\nto show what a small college can do given a concerted<br />\neffort by its students, faculty, and administration.<br />\n<br />\n.REMSEN VAN DE GRAFF<br />\n<br />\nGoucher gets superior speakers because, in the main,<br />\nit relies on its faculty to get them; assembly programs,<br />\npolitical activities are channeled and directed by interested<br />\nfaculty members.

This opinion<br />\nWas expressed by Fred DeKuyper, campus representative of<br />\nthe pristine periodical, who<br />\nadded that this is also the<br />\nOpinion of his bosses in Chicago.<br />\nConcerning the threatened<br />\nlawsuit against Roland Blantz,<br />\nChairman of the dance and<br />\nagainst the Cotillion Board and<br />\nthe Booster Club. DeKuyper<br />\nstated that no suit was ever<br />\ndrawn up and none is contemplated in the future. DeKuyper<br />\nexplained that Playboy had told<br />\nBlantz that he would be sued<br /><br />\nfor infringement of copyright if<br />\na hired model were given the<br />\ntitle \"Miss playboy\" or \"Miss<br />\nPlaymate.\" DeKuyper said he<br />\nknew all along that Blantz would<br />\nnot go through with the announced plans, but that if by<br />\nsome chance Blantz had not retreated from his position, Playboy would have withdraWn permission to use their decorations<br />\nat the dance, and then Blantz<br />\nwould not only have been sued<br />\nfor infringement, but also for<br />\nunauthorized use of decorations.<br />\nDeKuyper told the N-L that<br />\nhe had attended the dance and<br />\nsaid that it seemed to be a fine<br />\naffair, but he was treated with<br />\n(Continued on Page 2)<br /><br />\nbrought to the attention of the<br />\nColonel, with the opinion added<br />\nto it, that such a discussion had<br />\nno place in the classroom.<br />\nHowever, Cadet Colonel Mal<br />\nBuchner expressed the feeling<br />\nthat \"there is nothing discussed<br />\nin class not pertinent to the<br />\nwelfare of the ROTC Department. Since the Military Ball is<br />\nan important activity of the<br />\nCorps, even though it is a social<br />\nactivity, a discussion of it during class was certainly not a<br />\nwaste of time, but in fact enabled us to plan for a more successful dance.\"<br /><br />\nHONOR<br />\nAs a result of violations reported just before and during<br />\nthe spring examination<br />\nperiod, the Honor Commission<br />\nconducted four trials. Seven<br />\nstudents were accused in these<br />\ntrials.

The faculty<br />\noverwhelmingly favored the election of Senator John Kennedy.<br />\nThe students interviewed came<br />\nmainly from two sources. Of the<br />\nthree hundred interviewed, about<br />\n200 were dorm students and the<br />\nremainder were chosen at random from the cafeteria at Levering Hall. The faculty were<br />\nfrom six departments: Classics,<br />\nEnglish, Electrical Engineering,<br />\nBiology, History and Psychology.<br />\nThe students were asked to answer the questionaire whether<br />\nthey had made a choice or not,<br />\nwhile the faculty questionaire<br />\nwas distributed through the mail,<br />\nwith only a small percentage<br />\nanswering.<br />\nFive Questions<br />\nThe questionaire asked five<br />\ndifferent questions.

Already, Goucher College has<br />\nhad two major speakers come to her campus: the great<br />\nhistorian, Eric Goldman, and the eternal leader of the<br />\nSocialist party, Norman Thomas. Its political activities,<br />\nboth on and off the Towson campus, have been such as<br />\nto cause the Goucher Weekly to editorialize its compliments for the students' enthusiasm, while our so-called<br />\npolitical groups have done comparatively little as Hopkins<br />\norganizations. Last year, the whole of Goucher's assembly<br />\nprogram for the year was devoted to searching explorations of urban problems, as she attracted a number of<br />\nextremely competent speakers.<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\nThis is not meant to be a general glorification of<br />\nGoucher College to the detriment of Hopkins; it is meant<br />\nto show what a small college can do given a concerted<br />\neffort by its students, faculty, and administration.<br /><br />\n.REMSEN VAN DE GRAFF<br /><br />\nGoucher gets superior speakers because, in the main,<br />\nit relies on its faculty to get them; assembly programs,<br />\npolitical activities are channeled and directed by interested<br />\nfaculty members.
