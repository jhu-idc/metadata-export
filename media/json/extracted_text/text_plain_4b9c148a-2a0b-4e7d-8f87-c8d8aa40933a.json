In that issue,<br />\nParker joined William Walker, leader of<br />\nthe workers' grievance committee<br />\nmovement,in contending that the wages<br />\npaid by Hopkins were not really \"living<br />\nwages.\" Parker was unavailable for<br />\ncomment.<br />\n<br />\nPromulgated at the rally were the<br />\nSDS demands concerning the workers.<br />\nThey include the resolution of all labor<br />\nquestions through collective bargaining,<br />\nthe publication of Hopkins' payscales,<br />\nand open admission for all workers to<br />\nthe academic University and to all<br />\nschool facilities.<br />\nA member of the Black Panthers<br />\nbriefly addressed the small crowd.<br />\nAnother Panther stated that they had<br />\ncome to Hopkins \"because the students<br />\nhave committed themselves to a fight<br />\nthat we have committed ourselves to.\"<br />\nPanther Gordon Taylor said that the<br />\nHopkins SDS and the Baltimore<br />\nPanthers would soon be forming a<br />\ncoalition to press their demands, though<br />\nhe would not reveal the details. \"Give us<br />\nfreedom or death,\" he declared.<br />\nMarring the picketing were two<br />\nbrief fights between demonstrators and<br />\nsome students of obviously differing<br />\npolitical opinions.

He felt that<br />\nuntil the university demonstrated an<br />\nunwillingness to talk, which it has not<br />\nup to this point, the best plan of action<br />\nwould be to await the outcome of the<br />\ngrievance committee negotiations.<br />\nThe grievance committee was<br />\nofficially constituted a week ago<br />\nThursday in a letter signed by sixty<br />\nsome employees addressed to Wesley<br />\nTaylor, the Hopkins plant manager. This<br />\nletter maintained that: \"The main<br />\npurpose for forming this committee will<br />\n<br />\nBSU Denies Support to SDS Boycott<br />\nIssuing a statement to University<br />\nofficials, the Black Student Union<br />\ndecried the SDS boycott of Levering<br />\nHall cafeteria on Wednesday and<br />\ndeclared that such action was<br />\nunwarranted.<br />\nThe reason for the boycott is the<br />\nalledged mistreatment of black custodial'<br />\nemployees by the administration. The<br />\nBSU, after conferring the William<br />\nWalker of the newly-formed workers<br />\ngrievance committee, determined that<br />\n\"many of the issues in question have<br />\neither been resolved or are under<br />\nnegotiation.\"<br />\nAccording to Bruce Baker,<br />\npresident of the BSU, there was no need<br />\nfor a demonstration against the<br />\nadministration. \"If they (the workers)<br />\ndon't want us involved, we won't be,\"<br />\n<br />\nhe said. \"I don't think there is any issue<br />\nleft.\"<br />\nThe statement read, \"it is with<br />\nresentment that we view the current<br />\nattempt by the members of the SDS to<br />\nmake this a black-white issue,<br />\ncompletely usurping the initiative from<br />\nthe .workers and disrupting the<br />\nfunctions of the University by<br />\nboycotting Levering Hall, etc.\" Baker<br />\nbelieves that \"people are being misled\"<br />\nby the SDS.<br />\nEmphasized in the statement,<br />\nwhich was sent to President Lincoln<br />\nGordon and to Robert L. Strider,<br />\nAssociate Dean for Administration, was<br />\nthe readiness of Hopkins black students<br />\nto support the custodial employees in<br />\nany way if necessary. \"WHEN<br />\nSUPPORT IS REQUESTED WE WILL<br />\n<br />\nRESPOND,\" it read, but only when aid<br />\nhas been asked for.<br />\nAlso expressed in the letter to<br />\nGordon and Strider is the opinion that<br />\nchanges are necessary in the University's<br />\npersonnel structure. \"We support<br />\nwholeheartedly the quest for higher<br />\nwages, additional fringe benefits and<br />\nimproved working conditions for all<br />\nconcerned,\" the statement declared.\"A<br />\ndeep concern for the welfare of their<br />\nfamilies and their children's future is<br />\ndefinitely a motivating factor among<br />\nthese men, and if these goals are to be<br />\nmet, definite changes must be made and<br />\na meaningful discourse established<br />\nbetween the parties concerned.\"<br />\nThe BSU also expressed<br />\nconfidence in William Walker as the<br />\nrepresentative of the workers.<br />\n<br />\nbe to promote a better working<br />\nrelationship with the University. Also,<br />\nwe truly hope that this committee will<br />\nform a better communication channel<br />\nbetween employee and employer.\"<br />\nThe committee will consist of<br />\nthree custodial workers: William T.<br />\nWalker, Novill Snowden, and Edgar R.<br />\nJohnson. It will represent \"any workers<br />\nwho want to be represented.\" On this<br />\npoint, Walker mentioned that, \"If the<br />\nLevering Hall workers have a grievance,<br />\ntheir recourse doesn't have to be the<br />\nSDS; they can take the course that we<br />\nhave taken and join our grievance<br />\ncommittee.\"<br />\nThe first issues that the<br />\ncommittee intends to handle are: free<br />\neducation for the employees of the<br />\nUniversity who are qualified,<br />\ndetermination of wages (base and<br />\nmaximum wages, and increases for<br />\nworkers who have been employed for<br />\nsome length of time), and a meeting of<br />\nall university workers to inform them of<br />\nthe grievance machinery which has been<br />\nset up and the proper use of it. Walker<br />\npointed out that the increase for a<br />\nnewly-hired worker can be up to $300 a<br />\nyear more. For workers employed for<br />\nany length of tijne, however, the<br />\nincrease is less than $100 a year.<br />\nJoseph P. Rumberger, Director of<br />\nthe Office of Personnel Services,<br />\npointed out, concerning future<br />\nincreases, \"Cost, while not the most<br />\nimportant issue, is a hell of an<br />\nimportant one\". He added that, as<br />\nwages increase, \"Cost does become a<br />\nmajor factor\". He added that, as wages<br />\nincrease, \"Cost does become a major<br />\nfactor.\"<br />\nIn the past, the normal time for<br />\nacross the board increases has been in<br />\nJuly, with the submission of the new<br />\nbudget. Many employees feel that the<br />\ncurrent increase was merely an early<br />\ngranting of an increase that they would<br />\nhave received at any rate, but was<br />\nhastened by the current publicity.<br />\nRumberger denied that the last<br />\nincrease was in any way influenced by<br />\nthe recent publicity. \u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fHOMEWOOD.

Education must be an<br />\nintegrated experience and sometimes the student needs<br />\nhelp bringing the pieces together.\" He felt that an<br />\nexcellent course to begin this cooperation would be one<br />\nconcerning literature, art, science, and music and their<br />\neffects on society with the forces of history in the<br />\nnineteenth century.<br />\nDr. McClain noted that he had taught a similar<br />\ncourse in Germanic Culture from the German tribes to<br />\nWorld War II at Harvard.

The present course, in which the first<br />\nsemester is a study of theory and the second is<br />\nconcerned with scientific biography, is being discarded<br />\nin favor of the traditional two semester course which<br />\ntraces the chronological development of science.

Passarella, President<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\nDear Mr. Passarella,<br />\nThis is in response to your letter of February 25,<br />\ninforming me of the resolution passed by the Student<br />\nCouncil on February 24 concerning the reform of the<br />\nacademic calendar to a \"four-one-four\" system.'<br />\nI have been actively interested in calendar reform<br />\never since learning of the way in which calendar<br />\ndiscrepancies presently obstruct course interchanges<br />\namong the divisions of the University and with Goucher<br />\nand other colleges in the Baltimore area. I was also<br />\nimpressed by the widespread endorsement by<br />\nundergraduates last spring of a petition favoring an<br />\nearlier start to the academic year and completion of the<br />\nfirst term before the Christmas vacation.<br />\nFor these reasons, I was disappointed last summer<br />\nby one calendar committee report, largely' limited to<br />\naligning the second semester starting dates. I requested<br />\nDr. Bevan to take personal leadership of a new and<br />\nstronger University-wide ad hoc committee. It was<br />\nrequested to seek a uniform calendar which would<br />\nfacilitate exchanges among our several academic<br />\ndivisions, would be responsive to student sentiment last<br />\nspring, and would also help develop a more active<br />\nexchange program with Goucher and other colleges.<br />\nThat ad hoc Committee has just completed its<br />\nreport. The document has not yet been circulated either<br />\nto faculty or to students, and I have seen its text this<br />\nmorning for the first time. It does recommend a<br />\n\"four-one-four\" system, in which the short January term<br />\nwould be used for tutorial instruction, intensive<br />\nseminars, and other projects.<br />\nWith respcct to timing, the report, makes the<br />\nfollowihg'statement:'<br />\n<br />\n\"Each division should modify its present calendar<br />\nin the manner indicated below, adopting this change no<br />\nlater than the fall of 1970. It is highly likely that time<br />\nmay be needed for the modification of the courses in<br />\nmedicine to fit a forty rather than a thirty-six week<br />\nschedule, and for the special preparation by departments<br />\nof the Homewood faculty of programs to be conducted\u2022<br />\nduring the January period of undergraduate<br />\ninstructions.\"<br />\nThe Student Council resolution quoted in your<br />\nletter of February 25 suggests action by me to<br />\nimplement the revised calendar this coming September.<br />\nCalendar reform, however, is not merely an<br />\nadministrative matter. It has important academic<br />\nimplications, including curricular changes involved in the<br />\nproposed new type of short term which are of very great<br />\ninterest to the faculty. Faculty consideration, both of<br />\nthe merits of the proposed reform and of its timing, is an essential part of.any orderly reform of the University<br />\ncalendar.<br />\nIn view of the urgency expressed by the Student<br />\nCouncil, I am arranging for prompt discussion among<br />\nappropriate student and faculty bodies, in order to<br />\naccelerate to the maximum their consideration of the<br />\nrecommendations of the ad hoc Committee. Because of<br />\nthe deadlines on catalogue publications and the time<br />\nrequired to prepare for effective academic use of a new<br />\nshort term, it is clear that implementation of the reform<br />\nin the coming academic year would require a definite<br />\ndecision by mid-March or end of March at the latest. I<br />\nwill therefore request urgent consideration by the<br />\nfaculty as well as the Student Council and suggest a<br />\ncalendar of meetings which will make possible a definite<br />\ndecision by that time.<br />\nSincerely Yours,<br />\n'Dr. Lincoln Gordon<br />\n<br />\n1. That a special meeting of the General Assembly<br />\nof the Faculty will be called on Friday, March 14,1969,<br />\nto consider the-following:<br />\na. the merits of the \"four-one-four\" calendar<br />\nreform as recommended by Dr. Bevan's Committee<br />\nb. the implementation of such reform beginning<br />\nSeptember, 1969<br />\nC. makes recommendations to the Acidemic<br />\nCouncil so that a decision by the Academic Council can<br />\nbe reached on the matter no later than March 26. If<br />\nnecessary the Academic Council will convene a special<br />\nmeeting for this purpose.<br />\n2. That if the Academic Council approves the<br />\ncalendar reform for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, it<br />\nshall be implemented at Homewood next year. This<br />\nmeans that the Inability of one of the other divisions of<br />\nHopkins to implement calendar reform by September of<br />\n1969 would not be sufficient reason to prevent its<br />\nimplementation for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nnext year. ,<br />\n3. That if, when the proposal is under faculty<br />\n-consideration, the change from MTW/ThF to MWF/TTh<br />\nbecomes a major obstacle, then the \"four-one-four\" with<br />\nthe short January term and its advantages will be<br />\nconsidered without this class schedule change.<br />\n4. If the plan is accepted, Academic Council<br />\nmembers feel that students should participate in the<br />\nplanning of the short term so that together students and<br />\nfaculty may make this a most meaningful and valuable<br />\neducational experience.<br />\nThe above shall be submitted to the Student<br />\nCouncil on Monday, March 3,1969,for consideration as<br />\na positive response to their resolution of February 24,<br />\n1969.<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 6<br />\n<br />\nNEWSLETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD,BALTIMORE, FEB. 28, 1969<br />\n<br />\nConflict at Duke: StudentAgitation Southern Style<br />\nDURHAM, N.C.(CPS)\u2014Anyone who has<br />\ntraveled or lived both in the North and South<br />\nwill tell you there's a different style of life in the<br />\nSouth. There is a caltural and social lag. Legal<br />\nrights tend to be retarded in many areas. Any<br />\ncampus uprisings until last week, were confined<br />\nto black schools. Then along came Duke.<br />\n.<br />\nWhy Duke? Despite its low (1%) enrollment of<br />\nblack students, Duke had a higher number of blacks than<br />\nany other major white university in the region. Duke<br />\nattracts a proportionately high number of non-southern<br />\nwhites, who provide the backing for black demands.<br />\nDuke has a high quality faculty, a good number of<br />\nwhom have come from East and West Coasts' best<br />\ngraduate schools. The Duke administration, already<br />\ncommitted to Negro education by virtue of foundation<br />\ngrants, had agreed to talk to black students about their<br />\nneeds.<br />\nEarlier Black Action<br />\n141 addition, blacks in Durham already had their<br />\nown activity going - a boycott of local white merchants<br />\nfor better legal and social treatment in the town. And<br />\nlast year, students supported and helped organize the<br />\nnon-academic (99% black) employees' requests to the<br />\nadministration for better working conditions.<br />\nGoing against such campus activism was the fact<br />\nthat the largest bloc of Duke students is still the<br />\n\"Southern Gentleman\" variety. In addition, the<br />\nadministration had been taking under consideration albeit slowly - Negro demands last spring and again this<br />\nfall. And of course, Duke, like most other private<br />\nschools, has a repressive special-interest-oriented Board<br />\nof Trustees.<br />\nLong Standing Demands<br />\nThe Afro-American Society at Duke had been<br />\ntalking with the administration about their demands<br />\nsince the fall of 1966. They had gotten nowhere. They<br />\nhad legitimate demands which, during the course of<br />\nthose 2/<br />\n1<br />\n2 years, were diluted and only nominally acted<br />\nupon, if at all. So a sense of futility within the black<br />\ngroup in a basically conservative environment, coupled<br />\nwith a resisting administration which yielded little at all,<br />\ncreated the tension which inevitably led to a classic<br />\nstudent uprising against the administration.<br />\nThroughout this activity-commencing with the<br />\nAllen (Administrative) Building takeover on February<br />\n13, until the announcement of the settlement on the<br />\nfollowing Sunday-there were definite signs that this was<br />\na Southern campus, where everything-even student<br />\nagitation-is done in moderation.<br />\n<br />\nDUKE DEMONSTRATORS being gassed by police - the student<br />\nagitation had a \"marked Southern personality\".<br />\n<br />\nThe demands were toned down. In almost all of<br />\nthem, there was a qualifier which would allow for some<br />\nnon-black activity within the black community. And the<br />\nsettlement they agreed to on the demands showed this.<br />\nTo a Columbia or Berkeley student, the settlement<br />\nwould have seemed to leave the students no better off<br />\nthan before their demonstration.<br />\nNot once did the stipulation that they were<br />\n\"non-negotiable\" enter into the takeover. (Even if the<br />\ndemands on northern campuses are negotiable, you<br />\ndon't say that - it weakens your position). The demands<br />\nand their settlements show the result:<br />\n-Accredited department of Afro-American studies.<br />\nSettlement: An Afro-American studies program.<br />\n-A black dorm on campus, with some whites<br />\npermitted. Settlement: A black \"living-learning\"<br />\nprogram.<br />\n-29% black students by 1973, (29% is the<br />\npercentage.of blacks in the region). Settlement: Demand<br />\nrejected, but a \"significant increase\" in black enrollment<br />\npledged.<br />\n-Reinstatement of black students who failed in<br />\nthe fall. Settlement: Administration said it would study<br />\nthis, and set up a summer program for incoming<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\n-Financial reassurance for black students.

I<br />\nwould like, therefore, this opportunity to express my<br />\nviews.<br />\nIt seems to me that one can address this issue<br />\nwithout dragging in a lot of ideologies that will<br />\ncompromise the argument in the eyes of those not<br />\nsharing the ideology. The issue seems rather simple: it is<br />\ndifficult to believe that an enemy nation will not equip<br />\nits missiles with the same technology that assures us that<br />\nour missiles can penetrate their defenses. In view of this,<br />\nthe marginal utility of an ABM system is slight, given its<br />\nexpense. Stopping a .\"stray launch,\" or the fraction of<br />\nmissiles launched from submarines hardly emerge as<br />\nworthwhile goals, given the fact that we have lived with<br />\nthe first risk comfortably enough, thus far, and that<br />\nthere exists a tremendous overkill potential on the part<br />\nof nations with missile-bearing submarines.<br />\nIt is sufficient to appreciate that the technological<br />\nimpetus of a military and industrial program, given<br />\nanxiety about national defense and vested interests in<br />\norganizations and products, could lead to an enormous<br />\nexpenditure for a technically ineffective \"protective\"<br />\nsystem, particularly since there is no feasible way of<br />\ntesting that system in action. We already have an<br />\nexample of such an impetus in the case of the manned<br />\nspace-flight program, Apollo.<br />\n<br />\nEven those who are concerned mainly with<br />\nnational defense rather than humanitarian goals should<br />\nbe able to find merit in the argument that the money for<br />\nan ineffective ABM system would be better spent<br />\nupgrading the human resources of our country. I<br />\ncertainly hope that such persons will give serious<br />\nconsideration to this issue on March 4th and on other<br />\ndays as well, and not be put off by the unfortunate turn<br />\nthat is sometimes taken in publicizing proposed activities<br />\non March 4th. The purpose of that day should be to<br />\npause and think, and not to \"stop research\" or \"strike\".<br />\nThe rhetorical mentality of such publicity is that people<br />\ncan only be prompted by destructive emotions, that<br />\nresearch is the enemy and is not even important, and<br />\nthat the university's classes are an appropriate target for<br />\naction because they are at hand and vulnerable. Instead<br />\nof strengthening intellectual institutions that could<br />\nsucceed in influencing national policy, this trend is<br />\nanti-intellectual. (Cramer's News-Letter article was a<br />\nrefreshing exception to this trend.) Some of the<br />\npublicity has also undermined support for this most<br />\nserious issue by linking it to issues that are more<br />\nquestionable, such as secret research on campus and, by<br />\nimplication, ROTC. Many people recognize that it is<br />\nvaluables to have civilian scientist participation in<br />\nmilitary projects, and by the better scientists, in order to<br />\nhave the civilian viewpoint adequately represented in the<br />\nformation of policy. Indeed, it could be said that it is<br />\nmainly as a result of civilian scientist participation in<br />\n<br />\nABM research and the AEC that we have come to<br />\nquestion on a broad public scale the wisdom of an ABM<br />\nsystem.<br />\nStudents today probably do not recall that it was<br />\nnecessary to fight to obtain civilian control of atomic<br />\nenergy, in order not to have it completely under military<br />\ncontrol. Those who advocate the withdrawal of<br />\nuniversity scientists from military-related research would<br />\ndestroy the most effective monitoring system we have<br />\nfor control over that research. Similarly, those who<br />\nblindly attack ROTC seem not to appreciate that the<br />\n\"civilianizing\" effect of ROTC officers on the military is<br />\nat least as great as any \"militarizing\" effect of ROTC<br />\ntraining on ROTC candidates. Unless one wishes to do<br />\naway altogether with the Army, it seems ill-advised to<br />\nattack ROTC. The question of whether we should have<br />\nan Army is, of course, as legitimate as any other issue,<br />\nbut it is irresponsiblt to raise this issue without coupling<br />\nit to a well-worked out policy for the fate of Americans<br />\nin a world of nations without an international legal<br />\nsystem backed by an enforcement agency. The \"crunch\"<br />\nof world overpopulation, for example, over which the<br />\nUnited States has little control, and which is mainly<br />\naggravated by simple humanitarian efforts like giving<br />\nfood, may occur during the lifetime of the present<br />\ncollege generation. To put it only slightly simply, this<br />\nwill occur when the natural increase in population in any<br />\none year, now occurring at a rate which adds more<br />\n<br />\nProfessionalism at Grumman<br />\n\u201e.is personal development programs<br />\nAs a graduating engineer, how can you position yourself so that your career chances are constantly optimized?

The work of this year's<br />\ncalendar committee has provided students with their first tangible hope<br />\nfor change. The Council's action will help ensure that this year's efforts<br />\nwill not degenerate into a mere plethora of words and promises.<br />\nIn its letter to Dr. Gordon, the Council stated that they could see no<br />\n\"reason powerful enough to justify a further delay\"in restructuring the<br />\nHopkins calendar. On the basis of the facts reported in the News-Letter<br />\nduring the past two weeks, we agree.<br />\nThe Council has threatened to call for a general strike of students if<br />\nthere is not a favorable response to their demands from the<br />\npowers\u2014that\u2014be. Dr. Gordon has replied favorably to the Council on this<br />\nmatter, but the brunt of the decision now lays with the Academic<br />\nCouncil, (three votes against the calendar proposal on the Academic<br />\nCouncil automatically tables it). Council representatives met with the<br />\nAcademic Council Wednesday night, and after the usual parliamentary<br />\nbickering of those elder, elder statesmen, they procured an agreement to<br />\nvote on calendar reform in time to implement for next year.<br />\nWe urge the Student Council to make it clear to all faculty members<br />\ninvolved that a call for a student strike is a certainty should the Academic<br />\nCouncil or General Assembly of faculty members decide against calendar<br />\nreform. The Academic Council refused to give undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents anything but token representation on committees which decide<br />\nPolicy relevant to student affairs. If \"student agitation\" is the only<br />\nexpression of student opinion which the Academic Council can<br />\nunderstand, it is they who have dictated such an approach.<br />\nThe Student Council has decided to lead and perhaps, by this<br />\ndecision they are spelling out a new direction for themselves. In this<br />\nmatter, we support the Council and applaud them for their initiative.<br />\n<br />\n... And the March 4 Strike<br />\nThe Ad Hoc Committee of Concerned Scholars, Scientists, and<br />\nFaculty, in existence for a scant two weeks, continues to pick up support<br />\nfor the March 4 \"research stoppage\" strike. The strike is aimed at the<br />\ngovernment's \"misuse of science') and the University's connection with<br />\nmilitary research.<br />\nOf great importance, is the educational goals of the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee. We would hope that the Committee succeeds in alerting the<br />\nHopkins community to the wider implications of University complicity in<br />\nmilitary research as well as nationally relevant issues, such as the proposed<br />\nAnti-Ballistic Missile system (ABM) which is currently under<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nOur only bone of contention, however, concerns the right of faculty<br />\nand teaching assistants to arbitrarily use class time to discuss these issues.<br />\nThe scholars who comprise the Ad Hoc Committee are the same people<br />\nWho have held that students should be given a voice in curriculum and<br />\nPolicy decisions.

We support the Ad Hoc Committee<br />\nand their goals and we urge students and faculty to cooperate with the<br />\nMarch 4 program.<br />\n<br />\nLast But Not Least<br />\nWhile on the subject'of campus activism, there is another recent<br />\ncampus action which deserves comment. SDS, trhough its recent list of<br />\ndemands and Wednesday's boycott of Levering, has once again tried to<br />\n\"radicalize\" the campus by leaping enthusiastically into the workers'<br />\ndispute.<br />\nOur interest in this affair is not a lengthy discussion concerning the<br />\nrelative merits of SDS's demands; rather, we are amused by the latest<br />\nadventures of that same organization, which, a year ago, capped its career<br />\nby lying in wait for the Dow Chemical recruiter and subsequently failing<br />\nto find him.<br />\nAfter the worker's situation had been in the news for approximately<br />\na month, SDS apparently thought it had a fine opportunity to bring the<br />\n\"third world students\", black-versus-white issue, which has been<br />\neminently successful on other campuses, to Homewood. In a \"Boycott<br />\nLevering\" flyer this week, SDS noted the close association it had been<br />\nmaintaining with black Hopkins workers. Embarassingly enough, SDS was<br />\ninformed that the Hopkins workers were not interested in their support<br />\n(and accompanying demands on their behalf), and black undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students possibly less interested. William Walker, leader of<br />\nthe workers, refused to speak at the SDS rally. SDS had dropped off a<br />\ncopy of their demands with Dr. Gordon\u2014this being somewhat akin to<br />\nLuxembourg informing the U.S. Government that they expect the eastern<br />\nseaboard to be ceded to them by next week.<br />\nAs we said some time ago, the revolution still seems a long time off,<br />\nand until then, all we can expect is occasional comic relief.<br />\n<br />\ntii&HAVYT BE613 A9<69'OUT TO<br />\nPIMER.

Some commentators, such as Walter<br />\nLippman and Raymond Moley, have indicated that<br />\nWilson would still be read even if he had never gone into<br />\npolitics. Others, such as Harry Elmer Barnes, have taken<br />\nthe position that Wilson was a minor scholar and that<br />\nthe subsequent importance of his public career is<br />\nresponsible for any continued interest in his work.<br />\nOf primary importance is that Wilson scattered his<br />\nintellectual shot; he wrote some political science, some<br />\nhistory and some cultural essays. His best book was<br />\nun deniably his doctoral thesis at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nCongressional Government, which still stands as the<br />\nmost incisive and entertaining critique of the era when<br />\npresidents would not lead. His second most notable<br />\nwork is The State, a pioneering work in the analysis of<br />\ncomparative government.<br />\nWilson's historical production is far less notable.<br />\nHis most ambitious work, the five- volume History of<br />\nthe American People, is notable for devoting more space<br />\nto social and intellectual history than the average<br />\n<br />\nnational history of that period. However, Wilson's<br />\nhistory lacks the novelty of conception in Congressional<br />\nGovernment. Very few of his'judgments and conclusions<br />\nwould differ from those of a high school textbook. Since<br />\nWilson's time there have been major re-interpretations of<br />\nsuch areas as Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democracy,<br />\nthe Reconstruction Period and the circumstances of<br />\nimmigration. Wilson passed on all these areas, but he did<br />\nnot have a share in the formulation of new judgments.<br />\n<br />\n\u2014There was a deepening of the movement toward<br />\nblack pride and the control and improvement of the<br />\nNegro neighborhoods.<br />\n\u2014There had been a great increase of concern<br />\namong whites about the problems of the slums, but<br />\nNegro and white Americans remained far apart in their<br />\nperception of the causes and meanings of civil disorders.<br />\n\u2014The physical distance between the places where<br />\nNegroes and whites lived had not diminished during the<br />\nyear and was likely to increase with population growth.<br />\nNo Way Out?<br />\n\"The black neighborhoods in the cities remain<br />\nslums marked by poverty and decay, and the ghettoes<br />\nmarked by concentration and confinement,\" the<br />\nsummary said.<br />\n\"The nation has not yet made available to the<br />\ncities, or the blacks themselves, the resources to improve<br />\ntheses neighborhoods enough to make a significant<br />\nchange in the residents' lives. Nor has it offered those<br />\nwho might want it as the alternative of escape.\"<br />\nIn its chapter on the future of cities, the Kerner<br />\nCommission had said that if the current policies were<br />\ncontinued, there was a likelihood that the nation could<br />\nkeep disorders from spreading into major riots through<br />\nthe use of \"prompt and disciplined use of force.\" This is<br />\nwhat happened in 1968, the study showed.<br />\nSecond Warning<br />\nFor the long run, the commission warned:<br />\n\"To continue present policies is to make<br />\npermanent the divisions of our country into two<br />\nsocieties: One largely Negro and poor, located in the<br />\ncentral cities; the other, predominantly white and<br />\naffluent, located in the suburbs and outlying areas.\"<br />\nThe commission called for policies that would<br />\nenrich the slums and make it possible and attractive for<br />\nNegroes to move out \"according to his capabilities and<br />\ndesires, not his color.\"<br />\nThe conclusion that polarization had continued<br />\nwas not shared by all members.

Not<br />\ncontent with the first audience of 35,000,000,<br />\nTommy reverted to an old recording-company<br />\nploy and gave us a \"Best of the Brothers\" act<br />\nout of the past.<br />\nCBS's Good Thing is going the way of all its<br />\npredecessors, however, and what better tune for a swan<br />\nsong than \"Hey Jude\"? A little aural-genital stimulation,<br />\na few listless screams from the throats of<br />\nnow-abandoned teeny-boppers, and the dying gasp. That<br />\nmakes 70,000,000; plus the same mesmerized audience<br />\nfor \"Revolution\". Back page ads in the Times (Half the<br />\nPopulation of the U. S. Sees the Beatles on CBS) and<br />\nmaterial for a Beatle special (Who Are these Four<br />\nGiants?).<br />\nThe reason the Smothers' chose the Beatles'<br />\ncommerciality over, say, that of Marlboro cigarettes, was<br />\nthat the four lads had finally made good and gotten<br />\n\"Heys Jude\" nominated as best song of 1968 by<br />\nWhichever Grannies do that sort of thing. Leaving aside<br />\nthe question of equal time for the various unfortunates<br />\nWho are pitted against these titans, this may prove as<br />\ngood a chance as any (coming as it does in this restful<br />\nperiod between the Tim Hardin and Count Basic<br />\nConcerts) to take another definitive look at Music As It<br />\nIs Today,<br />\nThe \"genteele art of Musicicry\" has taken quite a<br />\nbuffeting in the 1960's. Greatly aided by Youthfare and,<br />\non the whole, the attitudes of record companies, and<br />\nincredibly stifled by commercial radio, a bipolarity has<br />\noccurred. Progress has gotten iconfused with profits.The<br />\nBeatles can follow up \"Strawberry Fields\" with \"Hello<br />\nGoodbye\"\u2014and have both reach number one. Iron<br />\nButterfly battles the Chambers Bros. for the top<br />\nSlot\u2014and Glen Campbell gets it. Groups like the Archies<br />\nOr the 1910 Fruit Gum Co. outsell, with a single 45, all<br />\nof Richie Haven's albums.<br />\nAnd yet, what is music? Objectivity implies an<br />\n2verview. And in terms of the future, it is hard to see<br />\nBack in the U.S.S.R.\" or \"Rocky Raccoon\" surviving<br />\nmuch better than \"1-2-3 Red Light\", or even \"Peggy<br />\nSue\". We enjoy Buddy Holly because of nostalgia. Our<br />\nkids won't be so easy on him\u2014there will have to be<br />\nsomething there for them to appreciate. \"Winchester<br />\nCathedral\", for instance, was something with which we<br />\nfelt no empathy. It sold because it was too ridiculous to<br />\nreject. And, despite squeals of delight from DJ's and<br />\nOther assorted maudlin types, no trend developed.<br />\nLennon-McCartney are tune-writers. They are very<br />\ngood tune-writers. So were Richard Strauss (whose<br />\nLieder were the absolute rage in their day) and George<br />\nGershwin and Rogers and Hart. Songs are nice. You can<br />\nsing them in the shower, or use them as good<br />\nbackground filler at a dull party, or pick them out on<br />\nthe Musical Instrument of Your Choice. They are good<br />\nto read by, if you ignore either the book or the song.<br />\n<br />\nTunes are, essentially, trivial\u2014as a sketch to a painting, a<br />\nhaiku to an epic.<br />\nThe most annoying aspect of Beatle cultists is not<br />\ntheir exaltation of Beatle tunes or trivia, but their<br />\nferocious defense of the Beatles as The Best. This ranges<br />\nfrom being the best in the music business today to being<br />\ngenerally the arts-iest foursome in the history of the<br />\nworld (citing John's writing and drawing as evidence of<br />\ndiversity). The myth is snowballing so quickly that huge<br />\nsegments of the of the population who give music nary a<br />\nthought all day long, are forced into admitting that the<br />\nBeatles are, in fact, The Best. \"Yea, man, Johnson's the<br />\nworst and the Beatles are the best.\"<br />\nReally? Blacks don't think the Beatles are the<br />\nbest\u2014they don't have any soul. Fifteen-year-olds don't<br />\nthink they're the best\u2014the boys are no longer Beautiful<br />\nPeople. Straights don't think they're the best\u2014they are<br />\ninto drugs. Anarchists don't think they're the best--they<br />\nhave sold out (in). Musicians don't think they're the<br />\nbest\u2014they aren't very good. (Who does think they are<br />\nthe best? Tom Smothers and his incredible captive<br />\naudience.)<br />\nYet, take a look at Playboy's Jazz and Pop<br />\nPoll\u2014the veritable Gallup of the musical scene. The<br />\nBeatles, number one vocal group; Ringo Starr, number<br />\nthree drummer (after Baker); George Harrison, number<br />\nfive guitarist (ahead of Bloomfield, B.B. King, and<br />\nWaters); Paul McCartney, number four vocalist and (get<br />\nthis) number six miscellaneous instrument (ahead of<br />\nButterfield, Kooper and Scruggs among numerous others). What won't fans do for their Heroes?<br />\n<br />\nAll of which leads to one last conclusion: lyrics.<br />\nWhat has pulled the Beatles through all these years has<br />\nbeen brilliant lyrics. That is the essence ofthe Beatles'<br />\nsuccess and what they will go down in History for. Yes,<br />\nthat and Yoko Ono's body.<br />\nTry the following experiment. Take your favorite<br />\nBeatle songs, write them down, then read them aloud<br />\n(keeping, if possible, Paul's sexiness out of your voice).<br />\nNow compare them with Paul Simon's or Leonard<br />\nCohen's or Bob Dylan's.<br />\nUnfair! you scream. One must consider the whole,<br />\nthe synthesis. Bullshit. The first law of objectivity states:<br />\n\"When the entirety is obscured by such factors as<br />\ncommercial promotion, cultism and general<br />\nclosed-mindedness, consider the various parts.\" The<br />\nparts aren't very good. And even (not a concession, mind<br />\nyou) if one refuses to accept this, there are various<br />\ngroups who do have lyrics and tunes which stand up by<br />\nthemselves\u2014Jeffersons Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger<br />\nService, the old Blues Project, and Simon and Garfunkel.<br />\nEnough. It is difficult to affect the Beatles'<br />\npopularity, impossible to alter their musical directions.<br />\nPerhaps after this latest fling of mockery, they have<br />\nemptied themselves of useless sarcasm and are preparing<br />\nfor true musical originality. One potentially good sign is<br />\n\"Revolution 9\", their first revolutionary move since<br />\n\"Strawberry Fields\". It is not good, but it shows, for a<br />\nchange, a progressive outlook.

The<br />\npeople in front of me were moved by<br />\nJoanna's plight and her occasional,<br />\nrancid tears. I could not find a single,<br />\nredemptive thing about \"Joanna''. It is a<br />\ntruly repulsive film - badly staged, badly<br />\nacted, and badly directed, the<br />\nconsequence of a shallow, exploitative<br />\nintelligence.<br />\n<br />\nSick Plot<br />\n\"Joanna\" is the story of an<br />\neighteen year old girl who conies to<br />\nLondon, goes to art school, spends her<br />\nevenings sleeping with an assortment of<br />\nmen, gets pregnant by a black night club<br />\nowner who subsequently goes to jail for<br />\nmanslaughter, and finally goes home.<br />\nThere is a bit of Lester, Fellini,<br />\nAntonioni and Brecht thrown in with a<br />\ndab of instant existentialism to make<br />\nthe audience say \"how profound, how<br />\n<br />\nprofound\". There are scenes of<br />\nMoroccan beaches with lots of misic to<br />\nmake us feel the full meaning,<br />\nintermingled with talk on life, death,<br />\npeople, committment (\"People...people<br />\nare such beautiful things.\"). These and<br />\nthe Felliniesque fantasies are so bad that<br />\nthey make one long for Doris and Rock.<br />\nThey make the beach scenes in \"A Man<br />\nand a Woman\" seem austere and even<br />\ncynical in comparison.

But someone<br />\nseems to have given Miss Waite the<br />\nimpression that she can. Which reveals a<br />\nproblem of tht whole movie. Somewhere<br />\nalong the line everyone got seduced by<br />\ntheir superficial ability and got carried<br />\naway. Another thing about Miss Waite it is not often I see a star who I want so<br />\nbadly to keep her clothes on.<br />\n<br />\nThis is Michael Sarne's first movie.<br />\nHe has taken a common plot - girl<br />\ncoming to mod world of London, used<br />\nother director's devices, thrown in<br />\noodles of sex and talk about<br />\n\"profound\" things, exploited the new<br />\nfreedom of showing black and white<br />\npeople in bed with each other, and<br />\ncome oil' with a slick, rotten<br />\ncommercial film. His camera proficiency<br />\nis for showing off. His tricks dominate<br />\nthe scenes instead of clarifying them.<br />\nI Hated It<br />\nIt is impossible to speak of<br />\n\"Joanna\" as a failure the way one<br />\nwould of \"How I Won the War\".

Playing from memory, they exhibited a unanimity<br />\nof expression which allowed them to achieve this level of<br />\nperfection without sacrificing depth of feeling.<br />\nHayden's Quartet irt C major,\"The Bird\", Opus 33<br />\nnumber 3, was performed with a style typical of the<br />\nensemble, a style which emphasizes the qualities of the<br />\ncomposition over variation of phrasing and individual<br />\nvirtuosity. The exception to this was Mr. Novak who was<br />\ngiven ample opportunity to demonstrate his profound<br />\ninsight into the intentions of the composer.<br />\nJanacek's Quartet number 2,\"Intimate Pages\" and<br />\nSmetana's Quartet in E minor,\"From My Life\" are very<br />\ncharacteristic of the Czech school of composition. The<br />\nbouncing bows in the presto passages and the adaption<br />\nof folk tunes are in the tradition of Central European<br />\nstring performance.<br />\nJanacek is an impressionist and the second<br />\nmovement of his Quartet contains a rhythm which seems<br />\nto be a parody of the Vienese composers. This piece is a<br />\nconglomeration of elements which makes it difficult to<br />\nclassify, although it is an enjoyable work.<br />\nBedrich Smetana is, with Dvorak, the epitome of<br />\nCzech music.

Those who would improve<br />\nmankind are too frequently oblivious to the fact that the<br />\nfreedom to direct their own lives to this end, or indeed<br />\nto any goal, is directly dependent upon their ability to<br />\ndefend their right to do so.<br />\nThose who oppose military training on campus<br />\ncontend that ROTC studies the unleashing of violence<br />\nand encourages the \"killer instinct.\" The study of crime<br />\ndoes no make one a criminal, but such endeavor is<br />\nnecessary if crime is to be understood and effective<br />\nmeasures developed against it. Similarly, the study of<br />\nviolence does not make one a violent person. Force and<br />\nviolence have been catalysts in human existence<br />\nthroughout history, both for good and evil. But now,<br />\nbecause of the current ability of nations to unleash more<br />\nthan sufficient force to obliterate the earth, the study of<br />\nthe control of violence and force is of paramount<br />\nimportance, and hence such studies are a legitimate area<br />\nof academic endeavor. In fact, the omission of such a<br />\ncourse of study would be \"antithetical to any notion of<br />\na great University.\"<br />\nThe ability to control force and use it wisely,<br />\nwhen its use is indicated for the preservation and<br />\nmaintenance of rights and freedoms, is the underlying<br />\ntheme of ROTC instruction. Furthermore, no one is<br />\nmore familiar with the horrors of war than those in the<br />\nmilitary, and thes very implication that military<br />\npersonnel \"get a charge\" out of killing and destruction is<br />\npure bunk. Instead of encouragement of a \"killer<br />\ninstinct\", ROTC cadets are appraised of the fact that<br />\npeace must be subscribed to by all parties, and until such<br />\ntime as it is, force and violence may be required to<br />\ndefend freedom. Whether a cadet would be able to kill<br />\nanother human being is a moot question;certainly few if<br />\nany have a desire to find out.<br />\nFinally, when a news medium is financed by a<br />\nminority, it may print what it desires, which is<br />\nconsistent with the right of free speech.

This<br />\ncommittee reached various conclusions<br />\nconcerning the social facilities in the<br />\ndormitories, and has submitted them to<br />\nMr. Wesley Taylor, the Plant Manager,<br />\nfor immediate consideration and<br />\ndecision. The joint Committee<br />\nemphasized that these improvements<br />\n\"should in no way constitute permanent<br />\nalternatives or substitute plans for a<br />\nStudent Center and all which such an<br />\naddition to this campus conveys.\"<br />\nAccording to the committee, this is an<br />\nattempt to improve communications,<br />\nespecially among undergraduates, which<br />\nare felt to be seriously lacking at the<br />\npresent.<br />\nThe prime recommendation of the<br />\nJoint Committee is to renovate the<br />\nSnack Bar so that the serving line will be<br />\ncafeteria-style, with as much self service<br />\nas possible. Dispensers of soda, coffee,<br />\nand pre-packaged goods should be faced<br />\n, outwards. Customers should pay a<br />\ni cashier located outside the bar. Fifteen<br />\nbooths and a juke-box should be<br />\ninstalled; a few tables should remain.<br />\nThe plan also calls for a bulletin board<br />\n<br />\nfor posters and necessary notices on the<br />\n\u2022walls. This proposal was submitted by<br />\nthe C1SF and is essentially the plan that<br />\nthat Committee has been concerned<br />\nwith since last year. The<br />\nrecommendations have received<br />\nenthusiastic support from Saga, which is<br />\ncurrently in charge of running the,Snack<br />\nBar.<br />\nThe Joint Committee plan calls<br />\nfor removal of the Snack Bar television<br />\nto the current dating lounge. Two pool<br />\ntables should also be placed in that<br />\n'room. The carpet should be changed to<br />\nan indoor-outdoor carpet, so \u2022students<br />\nwill be allowed to bring in food and<br />\nbeverages. The committee hopes that<br />\nthese changes will encourage more<br />\nextensive use of the lounge<br />\nThe recommendation of the Joint<br />\nCommittee also includes the CISF<br />\nproposal of a Rathskeller in the present<br />\nunused game room below the Snack<br />\nBar. The room should be furnished with<br />\n.a large bar, several booths, and a small<br />\nstage for amateur folk performances or<br />\ndramatic skits. Beverages, potato chips<br />\nand pretzels should be sold in quantity.<br />\nThe atmosphere of the room should<br />\n, encourage casual discus sion. A final<br />\n'request is that the blind room of the<br />\ncolor TV lounges be equipped with<br />\nsliding doors or some kind of partition<br />\nthat would enable'students to use this<br />\narea for playing cards, chess or checkers.<br />\nAll of the additional social<br />\nfacilities would be monitored where<br />\nnecessary, by work-study personnel.<br />\n<br />\nGROW WITH THE SPACE AGE AT<br />\n<br />\nGODDARD<br />\nSPACE<br />\nFLIGHT<br />\nCENTER<br />\n<br />\nNEW PENGUINS...<br />\nmajoring in psychology<br />\nCharles - croft.

Heyssel, the head of the<br />\nnewly created Office of Health Care<br />\nPrograms. According to Dr. Heyssel, the<br />\nPlans announced earlier this month are<br />\nno coincidence. \"We do have a<br />\ncommittment in the direction of family<br />\nhealth care\", he stated. \"I think we all<br />\nwant to deliver the fruits of our research<br />\nefforts to the public for their benefit.\"<br />\n<br />\nA second reason for the program,<br />\naccording to the Health Care Director, is<br />\nto'enhance \"our own education system;<br />\nto allow the 80% of our graduates who<br />\ngo into practice to receive practical<br />\nstudies in health care\".<br />\nThe East Baltimore program was<br />\nestablished for a number of reasons.<br />\n\"The people in the community around<br />\nthe Hospital, and I think rightfully so,<br />\nwant facilities in their neighborhoods.<br />\nTransportation to the Hospital now is<br />\nvery difficult for many\", Heyssel noted.<br />\n\"Also the clinic system is organized into<br />\nspecialties rather than family care. The<br />\npeople find it hard to get into the clinic<br />\nsystem for minor, non-complicated<br />\nillnesses.\" Thus Jong hours and quick,<br />\nimpersonal service many times resulted<br />\nfrom the present system, the director<br />\nsaid.<br />\nPatients Consulted<br />\nThe associate director of the<br />\nHealth Care Office is Dr. Torrey C.<br />\nBrown. He is presently in charge of<br />\ndeveloping out-of-hospital health care<br />\nprograms in East Baltimore. Dr. Brown's<br />\ninitial efforts will be planning a<br />\ncomprehensive system for the residents<br />\naround the Hospital using the resources<br />\n<br />\nof the city health department, other<br />\nhospitals and existing service agencies.<br />\nThe .backbone of the plans, however,<br />\nwill be determined by the local<br />\ninhabitants.<br />\nDrs. Heyssel and Brown are now<br />\nnegotiating with government officials<br />\nand other sources for funds. Heyssel<br />\nestimates that the physical cost of the<br />\nhealth centers would exceed $500,000,<br />\nwith medical equipment greatly<br />\nincreasing this cost. \"This requires<br />\ncooperation with other hospitals and<br />\ngovernment loans to pay the bills\", he<br />\nemphasized.<br />\nIn the next 6 months, Dr. Heyssel<br />\nhopes to develop these Model Families<br />\nCare Programs in the East Baltimore<br />\nneighborhoods with 20,000 persons<br />\neventually receiving medical care. Also,<br />\nancillary services such as vocational<br />\nrehabilitation and social service are<br />\nplanned to supplement their program.<br />\nThe Hopkins Hospital has opened<br />\nup a minor illness section in their<br />\nemergency ward recently. It operates 5<br />\ndays a week on a half-time basis, and<br />\nhas cut the patient's waiting time<br />\naccording to Dr. Heyssel. Additional<br />\nalterations are being formulated for the<br />\nHospital, the director stated.<br />\n<br />\nSTRAIGHT MAN WANTED<br />\nLOOKING FOR MALE STUDENT, 21 OR<br />\nOLDER, WHO WOULD LIKE TO TRY PLAYING<br />\nSTRAIGHT MAN IN A COMEDY TEAM WITH<br />\nEVENTUAL GOAL OF PERFORMING AT U.S.<br />\nARMY SERVICE CLUBS AND UNIVERSITIES.<br />\nIF INTERESTED DROP A CARD IN CARE<br />\nOF THE NEWS-LETTER BOX 1230, STATE AGE,<br />\nEDUCATION, AVAILABILITY, ADDRESS &<br />\nPHONE NUMBER FOR CAMPUS INTERVIEW.<br />\n<br />\nThe Columbia program will<br />\ninvolve the construction of a hospital<br />\nand related clinics in the newly built<br />\ncity, and operated by the administrative<br />\nand medical staff of Hopkins. Persons<br />\nenrolled in the plan will receive medical<br />\nservices including hospitalization, office<br />\nvisits to physicians, home care,<br />\ndiagnostic services, and regular medical<br />\ncheckups.<br />\nLater in 1969 Hopkins expects to<br />\nestablish the clinical facilities in<br />\nColumbia and begin to render care. The<br />\nConnecticut General Life Insurance<br />\nCompany has agreed to underwrite a<br />\nconstruction loan of $3.75 million and<br />\nwill assume the risk of operating deficits<br />\nduring the development years *of the<br />\nprogram. Dr. Heyssel said the upper<br />\nlimits of the medical plan would cost a<br />\nfamily of three or more between<br />\n$40-$45 a month. Less coverage would<br />\ncost less. In all, the director of the<br />\nproject estimates that 30,000-50,000<br />\npersons will eventually enroll in the<br />\nColumbia program.<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon and Dr.<br />\nRussell A. Nelson, the Hospital<br />\npresident said of the program, \"The<br />\nassociation of a university medical<br />\ncenter with a large insurance company<br />\nshould develop patterns applicable to<br />\nmany parts of the nation.\"<br />\nThe Health Services Research<br />\nCenter will analyze and evaluate the<br />\nsuccess of the newly-formed health care<br />\nprograms. The research center will be<br />\neither wholly or partially financed by<br />\nthe National Center for Health Services.<br />\nAccording to Heyssel, the center will<br />\n\"look at the consumer acceptance of<br />\nour programs, and it will devise new<br />\nways of doing things in the health<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nST/....,1 KS<br />\nSEA FOOD1<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLEB 1RGERS<br />\nEAT-IN OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

He noted that<br />\nironically most of the people that the programs are<br />\ndesigned to help are semi-literate and tend to give up in<br />\ndisgust when they are referred in an endless process from.<br />\none agency to the next.<br />\nAccordingly, the Model Cities Program is designed<br />\n\"to stress coordination of all federally assisted programs<br />\nin the Model Cities neighborhood, \"and to innovate by<br />\nutilizing widespread citizen participation in planning and<br />\nexecuting at all levels of decisionmaking.<br />\nBaltimore is ready to begin the final stage of the<br />\nexecution<br />\nModel Cities Program, a five year period of<br />\nbeen<br />\nhave<br />\ncouncils<br />\nty<br />\ncommuni<br />\nbeginning in 1969.

However, there is no guarantee that<br />\nthe resident members, elected by the community<br />\ncouncils, will be truly representative. \"It (Baltimore)<br />\nnot a Southern- city which is racist. It's a big city which<br />\nis corrupt.\"<br />\nCarter pointed to the inequities of the planned<br />\nEast-West Expressway which would \"recongest people in<br />\norder for some people to ride cool up and down the<br />\nstreets uncongested.\" Seven hundred million dollars,<br />\nnine times the five-year Model Cities budget, is being<br />\nspent to construct the new expressway.<br />\nBaltimore can get away with this, according to<br />\nCarter, because there is as yet \"no national commitment<br />\nto really rebuild and revitalize the city.\" Nor are there<br />\nenough funds \"going into cementing an economic base<br />\nfor the ghetto.\"<br />\nHowever, Carter rejected the black capitalism<br />\nconcept in favor of business cooperatives, because there<br />\n\"shouldn't be competition for the basic requirements of<br />\nexisting.\"<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore will be awarded a $10.5 million<br />\ngrant by the Department of Housing and Urban<br />\nAffairs next month for the first year of the<br />\nfive-year Model Cities Program. \u2022<br />\nThe nationwide $900 million program has<br />\napproved the Baltimore project,:, and, according to<br />\nModel City officials, aid will be available Eometirne in<br />\nMarch.

BALTIMORE, FEB. 28, 1969<br />\n<br />\nVarsity Five Falls to Terrors<br />\nIn Ciccarone's Final Contest<br />\n<br />\nJay's<br />\nNest<br />\nBy RICH HOLLANDER<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nVarsity basketball coach!<br />\nHenry Ciccarone is trading his<br />\nwhistle and playbook for the gray<br />\nflannel suit of the business world.<br />\nHe is vacating his athletic center<br />\ndesk after a Hopkins' career which<br />\nhas spanned a decade as both a<br />\nplayer and coach.<br />\nMr. Ciccarone presented his<br />\nresignation last September after<br />\nsix campaigns at the varsity helm.<br />\nHis future, as yet undecided, will<br />\nprobably be in the business world,<br />\nwhere opportunity knocks louder<br />\nthan in coaching. \"1 have to<br />\nsatisfy myself and make it big in<br />\nsomething else.\" Marshall Turner Coach Ciccarone watches his team<br />\naccepted his resignation.<br />\nperform against Western Marylanu.<br />\nFrom Annapolis to Homewood<br />\nA legendary athlete at Hopkins, \"Cic\" lettered in football and<br />\nlacrosse three times each. An All Mason-Dixon tailback, he guided<br />\nthe passing attack from the old single wing. Although hampered by a<br />\nknee injury, \"Cic\" held the most completed passes record until it<br />\nwas exlipsed by Jim Feely this year. Against Hampden-Sydney \"Cic\"<br />\nthrew three touchdown strikes Co a 6'5\" end Darwin Kim.<br />\nRecovering from his injury a News-Letter banner head read,<br />\n\"Ciccarone Returns To Face Terrors\".<br />\nNo less of a sensation with a lacrosse stick, \"Cic\" took<br />\nMI-American honors in every varsity season. In 1962 he set- a<br />\nphenomenal scoring record for midfielders with 25 goals and as<br />\nmany assists. During a senior year visit to Virginai, the Jay<br />\nmidfielder splurged for 5 goals and 2 assists.<br />\nDespite the gridiron and lacrosse heroics \"Cic\" became a<br />\nbasketball coach. The man who hired him, Marshall Turner, claims:<br />\n\"He thought, studied and acted like a coach. He has talent and<br />\nnatural ability and could be successful in coaching any sport.\"<br />\nHopkins' basketball has been mediocre. Coach Ciccarone has<br />\nattempted to upgrade the program but the administration has put<br />\nthe financial brakes to this goal. Athletic scholarships are, of course,<br />\nout of the question. Yet the basketball equipment is inferior and the<br />\nschedule is a disaster. After practicing six weeks the varsity plays<br />\nfour games before Christmas, followed by the final and intersession<br />\nbreak and the pro pace of February. Furthermore the administration<br />\nrefuses to subsidize the players staying in town during vacation as<br />\nwell as sanctioning Christmas tournaments and a northern swing.<br />\nIt's ironic that \"Cic's\" greatest basketball achievement will<br />\ntake place after he leaves. This year's superlative frosh hoopsters,<br />\nwhich he recruited, will make the Jays big winners next year. With<br />\nonly the captains leaving and the ascension of Grinberg, Lally, Apple<br />\nand Handleman, the new coach can thank \"Cic\" for many a future<br />\nvictory.<br />\nA snow-whipped night before finals in 1967 marked coach<br />\n\"Cic's\" most satisfying moment.

This brought the<br />\nhoopsters' season record to 3-14, the poorest in<br />\nrecent years.<br />\nDuring the early part of the game, both<br />\nteams traded baskets. Halfway through the first<br />\nhalf the terrors increased their lead from 19-17<br />\nto 30-19. The maintained this lead and went off<br />\nat halftime ahead by a score of 46-36. Hopkins<br />\ncame out fired up for the second half. Jeff<br />\nThomas and John Judy controlled the boards<br />\nand Dave Rebovich and Brian Berke started<br />\nhitting from the outside as the Blue Jays closed<br />\nthe gap to 66-59.

Thomas, Thorne and Judy<br />\neach had 10 points.<br />\nSaturday night's game was the final one for<br />\nBerke, captain of the Hopkins team. Berke has<br />\nscored over 1,200 points in his 4 years at<br />\nHopkins. Going into Saturday's game he needed<br />\n27 points to achieve a 19.0 average for the year,<br />\nwhich would have set a new school record. The<br />\nold record of 18.9 was set by Mone Margolis in<br />\n1953. Berke's 22 points left him five short of the<br />\nrecord. Saturday night was also the last game for<br />\nHal Thorne, the other co-captain, and John Judy,<br />\na junior who is graduating early. John did not<br />\nplay last year, but contributed greatly this<br />\nseason, doing an especially fine job when Jeff<br />\nThomas was injured.<br />\nThe Hopkins team set two records this<br />\n<br />\nyear. In their first game against Western<br />\nMaryland the Terrors poured in 115 points, the<br />\nmost ever scored in one game against the Blue<br />\nJays. The Varsity allowed 1420 points during the<br />\n17 game season while tallying 1183. The 83.5<br />\naverage for opponents' points in a game, broke<br />\nthe previous record of 81.3 set in 1955.<br />\n<br />\nBaby Jays Finish<br />\nPhenomenal Year<br />\nBy MIKE SHORE<br />\n<br />\nThe freshman basketball team has<br />\nfinished off a \" season which saw them<br />\nbreak forty-two team and individual<br />\nrecords, by winning games over Loyola<br />\nand Western Maryland, by scores of 93-85<br />\nand 92-76 respectively.<br />\nIt was the second victory of the season<br />\nover both of the squads. In the Loyola game the<br />\nBaby Jays went into the lockers at the half with<br />\na 43-30 lead. With five minutes left this lead had<br />\nbeen built up to 23 points. Coach Barrette then<br />\nsubstituted freely, and consequently, the final<br />\nscore was somewhat tighter than the actual game.<br />\nIt was a good defensive effort by the frosh.<br />\nThey had four men in double figures, Gary<br />\nHandleman with 24, George Apple with 18, John<br />\nLally with 19, and Hal Grinberg with 14.<br />\nOnSaturday, the Jays beat Western<br />\nMaryland in what was a very similar performance<br />\nto the Loyola game. The defense again excelled.<br />\nThis time John Lilly was the leading scorer with<br />\n26 points, and 15 rebounds. Hal Grinberg had 20<br />\nand Handleman 17.<br />\n<br />\nCENTER BILL PIETROWSKI sets for a charity toss in the<br />\nLoyola game.<br />\n<br />\nRecords Broken<br />\nThus the frosh finished off their season<br />\nwith an 11-3 record. They broke a phenomenal<br />\nnumber of records, including 28 individual and<br />\n14 team marks. Gary Handleman set seven of<br />\nthese marks, including most field goals, field<br />\ngoals attempted, free throw, free throws<br />\nattempted, free throw percentage, total points<br />\nand average number of points per game. He<br />\naveraged 26.0 points per game, taking the record<br />\naway from Brian Berke. John Lilly set the record<br />\nfor field goal percentage with a 55.3 percentage.<br />\nGeorge Alple broke varsity co-captain<br />\nHalThorne's records for assists with 82 on the<br />\nyear.

Trials will be<br />\nheld this afternoon and tomorrow, with the finals Friday<br />\nand Saturday night.<br />\n. In the past, Catholic University has dominated the<br />\nentire meet, with Loyola giving them a fight in the<br />\nsprints and the relays. The remaining teams have merely<br />\ndivided the other points among themselves. This year,<br />\nhowever, a close three team contest is in the offing with<br />\nLoyola and Hopkins challenging Catholics supremacy..<br />\nI5uring practice this week, Coach Frank Comfort<br />\nexpressed confidence in the ability of his swimmers to<br />\nwin the conference crown. Last year Hopkins won only<br />\nthe two butterfly events and the diving, with Howard<br />\nChernick and Rick- Wilson respectively. This year,<br />\nComfort's guarded i-citimism is based on the strength of'<br />\nthe Jays in several other events: Here is a brief summary<br />\nof the Hopkins lineup and relative strength:medley<br />\nrelay, Scott, O'Donnell, Chernick,. Turner-probablefirst<br />\nprovided Scott can recover from his ear infection; 50<br />\nand 100 free, Turner and Burnham- will surprise many,<br />\nalthough not the\" strongest event in the Hopkins lineup;<br />\n200 and 500 free, Weikel will place high in the 200,<br />\nwhile Fisher and Kuffner may both sneak into the 500<br />\nfinal; 1650-Weikel and Kuffner- good chance for a first<br />\nfrom Weikel, Kuffner may also place; Butterfly,<br />\nChernick and Solomon - Prospects for a sweep of both<br />\nfly events are excellent; backstroke - Weikel, Scott,<br />\nFisher-Could go as high as two-three in both events;<br />\nbreaststroke- O'Donnell, Ware, Treem-Two more firsts<br />\nfor the Jays and a possible sweep in the 100; 400 free<br />\nrelay - (Ware, Weikel, Turner, Burnham) will probably<br />\nscore from third to first; 800 free relay (Fisher, Weikel,<br />\nWare, Solomon)- again the Jays will place somewhere in<br />\nthe top three; Diving- Wilson is favored again, Myers if<br />\nhot may place; Lndividual Medley-Ware, Solomon,<br />\nFisher-probably 2,3 ik the 400 and 3,4 in the 200.<br />\nThe Jays have bben hurt by a ruling which limits<br />\nentries per event to two'per team. This negates Hopkins'<br />\ndepth in butterfly, backsiroke, and individual medley<br />\nwhile helping teams such us Loyola and Catholic with<br />\nme and possibly two top notch swimmers: Therefore,<br />\nttie finals will, for the most part, resemble a triangular<br />\nmeet between Catholic, Loyola, and Hopkins. Earlier<br />\nthis year Hopkins beat Catholic in-a scrimmage and lost<br />\nto Loyola in a dual meet. The Loyola coath thinks his<br />\nteam to be meet favorites.

He felt that<br />\nuntil the university demonstrated an<br />\nunwillingness to talk, which it has not<br />\nup to this point, the best plan of action<br />\nwould be to await the outcome of the<br />\ngrievance committee negotiations.<br />\nThe grievance committee was<br />\nofficially constituted a week ago<br />\nThursday in a letter signed by sixty<br />\nsome employees addressed to Wesley<br />\nTaylor, the Hopkins plant manager. This<br />\nletter maintained that: \"The main<br />\npurpose for forming this committee will<br /><br />\nBSU Denies Support to SDS Boycott<br />\nIssuing a statement to University<br />\nofficials, the Black Student Union<br />\ndecried the SDS boycott of Levering<br />\nHall cafeteria on Wednesday and<br />\ndeclared that such action was<br />\nunwarranted.<br />\nThe reason for the boycott is the<br />\nalledged mistreatment of black custodial'<br />\nemployees by the administration. The<br />\nBSU, after conferring the William<br />\nWalker of the newly-formed workers<br />\ngrievance committee, determined that<br />\n\"many of the issues in question have<br />\neither been resolved or are under<br />\nnegotiation.\"<br />\nAccording to Bruce Baker,<br />\npresident of the BSU, there was no need<br />\nfor a demonstration against the<br />\nadministration. \"If they (the workers)<br />\ndon't want us involved, we won't be,\"<br /><br />\nhe said. \"I don't think there is any issue<br />\nleft.\"<br />\nThe statement read, \"it is with<br />\nresentment that we view the current<br />\nattempt by the members of the SDS to<br />\nmake this a black-white issue,<br />\ncompletely usurping the initiative from<br />\nthe .workers and disrupting the<br />\nfunctions of the University by<br />\nboycotting Levering Hall, etc.\" Baker<br />\nbelieves that \"people are being misled\"<br />\nby the SDS.<br />\nEmphasized in the statement,<br />\nwhich was sent to President Lincoln<br />\nGordon and to Robert L.

Also,<br />\nwe truly hope that this committee will<br />\nform a better communication channel<br />\nbetween employee and employer.\"<br />\nThe committee will consist of<br />\nthree custodial workers: William T.<br />\nWalker, Novill Snowden, and Edgar R.<br />\nJohnson. It will represent \"any workers<br />\nwho want to be represented.\" On this<br />\npoint, Walker mentioned that, \"If the<br />\nLevering Hall workers have a grievance,<br />\ntheir recourse doesn't have to be the<br />\nSDS; they can take the course that we<br />\nhave taken and join our grievance<br />\ncommittee.\"<br />\nThe first issues that the<br />\ncommittee intends to handle are: free<br />\neducation for the employees of the<br />\nUniversity who are qualified,<br />\ndetermination of wages (base and<br />\nmaximum wages, and increases for<br />\nworkers who have been employed for<br />\nsome length of time), and a meeting of<br />\nall university workers to inform them of<br />\nthe grievance machinery which has been<br />\nset up and the proper use of it. Walker<br />\npointed out that the increase for a<br />\nnewly-hired worker can be up to $300 a<br />\nyear more. For workers employed for<br />\nany length of tijne, however, the<br />\nincrease is less than $100 a year.<br />\nJoseph P.

Passarella, President<br />\nThe Student Council<br />\nDear Mr. Passarella,<br />\nThis is in response to your letter of February 25,<br />\ninforming me of the resolution passed by the Student<br />\nCouncil on February 24 concerning the reform of the<br />\nacademic calendar to a \"four-one-four\" system.'<br />\nI have been actively interested in calendar reform<br />\never since learning of the way in which calendar<br />\ndiscrepancies presently obstruct course interchanges<br />\namong the divisions of the University and with Goucher<br />\nand other colleges in the Baltimore area. I was also<br />\nimpressed by the widespread endorsement by<br />\nundergraduates last spring of a petition favoring an<br />\nearlier start to the academic year and completion of the<br />\nfirst term before the Christmas vacation.<br />\nFor these reasons, I was disappointed last summer<br />\nby one calendar committee report, largely' limited to<br />\naligning the second semester starting dates. I requested<br />\nDr. Bevan to take personal leadership of a new and<br />\nstronger University-wide ad hoc committee. It was<br />\nrequested to seek a uniform calendar which would<br />\nfacilitate exchanges among our several academic<br />\ndivisions, would be responsive to student sentiment last<br />\nspring, and would also help develop a more active<br />\nexchange program with Goucher and other colleges.<br />\nThat ad hoc Committee has just completed its<br />\nreport. The document has not yet been circulated either<br />\nto faculty or to students, and I have seen its text this<br />\nmorning for the first time. It does recommend a<br />\n\"four-one-four\" system, in which the short January term<br />\nwould be used for tutorial instruction, intensive<br />\nseminars, and other projects.<br />\nWith respcct to timing, the report, makes the<br />\nfollowihg'statement:'<br /><br />\n\"Each division should modify its present calendar<br />\nin the manner indicated below, adopting this change no<br />\nlater than the fall of 1970. It is highly likely that time<br />\nmay be needed for the modification of the courses in<br />\nmedicine to fit a forty rather than a thirty-six week<br />\nschedule, and for the special preparation by departments<br />\nof the Homewood faculty of programs to be conducted\u2022<br />\nduring the January period of undergraduate<br />\ninstructions.\"<br />\nThe Student Council resolution quoted in your<br />\nletter of February 25 suggests action by me to<br />\nimplement the revised calendar this coming September.<br />\nCalendar reform, however, is not merely an<br />\nadministrative matter. It has important academic<br />\nimplications, including curricular changes involved in the<br />\nproposed new type of short term which are of very great<br />\ninterest to the faculty. Faculty consideration, both of<br />\nthe merits of the proposed reform and of its timing, is an essential part of.any orderly reform of the University<br />\ncalendar.<br />\nIn view of the urgency expressed by the Student<br />\nCouncil, I am arranging for prompt discussion among<br />\nappropriate student and faculty bodies, in order to<br />\naccelerate to the maximum their consideration of the<br />\nrecommendations of the ad hoc Committee. Because of<br />\nthe deadlines on catalogue publications and the time<br />\nrequired to prepare for effective academic use of a new<br />\nshort term, it is clear that implementation of the reform<br />\nin the coming academic year would require a definite<br />\ndecision by mid-March or end of March at the latest. I<br />\nwill therefore request urgent consideration by the<br />\nfaculty as well as the Student Council and suggest a<br />\ncalendar of meetings which will make possible a definite<br />\ndecision by that time.<br />\nSincerely Yours,<br />\n'Dr. Lincoln Gordon<br /><br />\n1. That a special meeting of the General Assembly<br />\nof the Faculty will be called on Friday, March 14,1969,<br />\nto consider the-following:<br />\na. the merits of the \"four-one-four\" calendar<br />\nreform as recommended by Dr. Bevan's Committee<br />\nb. the implementation of such reform beginning<br />\nSeptember, 1969<br />\nC. makes recommendations to the Acidemic<br />\nCouncil so that a decision by the Academic Council can<br />\nbe reached on the matter no later than March 26. If<br />\nnecessary the Academic Council will convene a special<br />\nmeeting for this purpose.<br />\n2. That if the Academic Council approves the<br />\ncalendar reform for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, it<br />\nshall be implemented at Homewood next year. This<br />\nmeans that the Inability of one of the other divisions of<br />\nHopkins to implement calendar reform by September of<br />\n1969 would not be sufficient reason to prevent its<br />\nimplementation for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />\nnext year. ,<br />\n3. That if, when the proposal is under faculty<br />\n-consideration, the change from MTW/ThF to MWF/TTh<br />\nbecomes a major obstacle, then the \"four-one-four\" with<br />\nthe short January term and its advantages will be<br />\nconsidered without this class schedule change.<br />\n4.

The Duke administration, already<br />\ncommitted to Negro education by virtue of foundation<br />\ngrants, had agreed to talk to black students about their<br />\nneeds.<br />\nEarlier Black Action<br />\n141 addition, blacks in Durham already had their<br />\nown activity going - a boycott of local white merchants<br />\nfor better legal and social treatment in the town. And<br />\nlast year, students supported and helped organize the<br />\nnon-academic (99% black) employees' requests to the<br />\nadministration for better working conditions.<br />\nGoing against such campus activism was the fact<br />\nthat the largest bloc of Duke students is still the<br />\n\"Southern Gentleman\" variety. In addition, the<br />\nadministration had been taking under consideration albeit slowly - Negro demands last spring and again this<br />\nfall. And of course, Duke, like most other private<br />\nschools, has a repressive special-interest-oriented Board<br />\nof Trustees.<br />\nLong Standing Demands<br />\nThe Afro-American Society at Duke had been<br />\ntalking with the administration about their demands<br />\nsince the fall of 1966. They had gotten nowhere. They<br />\nhad legitimate demands which, during the course of<br />\nthose 2/<br />\n1<br />\n2 years, were diluted and only nominally acted<br />\nupon, if at all. So a sense of futility within the black<br />\ngroup in a basically conservative environment, coupled<br />\nwith a resisting administration which yielded little at all,<br />\ncreated the tension which inevitably led to a classic<br />\nstudent uprising against the administration.<br />\nThroughout this activity-commencing with the<br />\nAllen (Administrative) Building takeover on February<br />\n13, until the announcement of the settlement on the<br />\nfollowing Sunday-there were definite signs that this was<br />\na Southern campus, where everything-even student<br />\nagitation-is done in moderation.<br /><br />\nDUKE DEMONSTRATORS being gassed by police - the student<br />\nagitation had a \"marked Southern personality\".<br /><br />\nThe demands were toned down. In almost all of<br />\nthem, there was a qualifier which would allow for some<br />\nnon-black activity within the black community. And the<br />\nsettlement they agreed to on the demands showed this.<br />\nTo a Columbia or Berkeley student, the settlement<br />\nwould have seemed to leave the students no better off<br />\nthan before their demonstration.<br />\nNot once did the stipulation that they were<br />\n\"non-negotiable\" enter into the takeover. (Even if the<br />\ndemands on northern campuses are negotiable, you<br />\ndon't say that - it weakens your position). The demands<br />\nand their settlements show the result:<br />\n-Accredited department of Afro-American studies.<br />\nSettlement: An Afro-American studies program.<br />\n-A black dorm on campus, with some whites<br />\npermitted. Settlement: A black \"living-learning\"<br />\nprogram.<br />\n-29% black students by 1973, (29% is the<br />\npercentage.of blacks in the region). Settlement: Demand<br />\nrejected, but a \"significant increase\" in black enrollment<br />\npledged.<br />\n-Reinstatement of black students who failed in<br />\nthe fall. Settlement: Administration said it would study<br />\nthis, and set up a summer program for incoming<br />\nfreshmen.<br />\n-Financial reassurance for black students. (this is<br />\ndue to cutbacks this past fall in available funds, which<br />\nhit black scholarships hard). Settlement: Taken under<br /><br />\nadvisement.<br />\n-An adviser for black students on university<br />\npayroll, chosen in consultation with blacks. Settlement:<br />\ngranted.<br />\n-A black student union, so that black student fees<br />\ncan to into a program relevant to them. Settlement:<br />\nGranted in substance; the current union will be split.<br />\n-Use of high school achievement instead of SAT's<br />\nas criteria for admission of blacks to Duke. Settlement:<br />\nBeing studied; meanwhile, high school records will be<br />\nweighted for black applicants.<br />\n-Self-determination for non-academic employees.<br />\nSettlement: Administration enters negotiations with<br />\nnon-academic employees this week.<br />\nAmnesty Refused<br />\n-End to tokenism in university power structure.<br />\nSettlement: Under consideration.<br />\n--Immediate end to police harassment and<br />\nprotection for all black students. Settlement: We'll see<br />\nwhat we can do.<br />\n-Amnesty for black students. Settlement: Refused,<br />\nbut administration has said that blacks will be tried under<br />\ntheir \"pickets and protest\" rule by the school's Judicial<br />\nCouncil. Civil court action may also take place.<br />\nThere are other manifestations of a southern-style<br />\nuprising, as opposed to the large northern type we've all<br />\ngrown to know and love:<br />\n-Nothing in the Allen Building was destroyed or<br />\ntampered with.<br />\n-When the blacks vacated the building, they<br />\nmingled freely and talked openly with whites.<br />\n-The Student Liberation Front (white radicals at<br />\nDuke) made a tactically bad mistake They had occupied<br />\nthe third floor of Allen in support of the blacks, but left<br />\nin the middle of the afternoon to attend a rally. On their<br />\nreturn, the building had been sealed off by local police,<br />\nwho denied them re-entry.<br />\n-The blacks vacated the building when they were<br />\ntold by the administration that they must leave or the<br />\npolice would oust them physically.<br />\nNow, with the protest over, the problems created<br />\nhave been met head on by other factions of the Duke<br />\ncommunity. White students have set up departmental<br />\nunions to agitate for change in their majors. Grad<br />\nstudents are doing likewise. Relations between President<br />\nKnight's office and some faculty members are tense. At<br />\na faculty meeting last Thursday, President Knight said<br />\nthe outcome of a vote on whether the school should use<br />\npolice or not was irrelevant, since the decision had<br />\nalready been made to call the police.<br /><br />\nMEN<br />\nTAKE IT OFF<br />\nWITH NOXEMA<br />\nZ<br />\nx LIME SHAVE CREAM<br />\nr4<br /><br />\nVi<br />\nW<br /><br />\n:GREEN WAY PHARMACY 0<br />\nz<br />\nx CHARLES &amp; 34 STS. z<br /><br />\n\"THERE'S NOTHING<br />\nLIKE IT AT ALL!\"<br />\n\"'Weekend' is a great original work.<br />\n'Weekend' is Godard's vision of hell<br />\nand it ranks with the visions of the<br />\ngreatest.\"<br />\n\u2014Pauline Kael, New Yorker<br /><br />\nM Ft RFIRRIlli rt IIRRZ<br /><br />\n\"A fantastic film in which all of life becomes a weekend\u2014a cataclysmic,<br />\nseismic traffic jam.

I<br />\nwould like, therefore, this opportunity to express my<br />\nviews.<br />\nIt seems to me that one can address this issue<br />\nwithout dragging in a lot of ideologies that will<br />\ncompromise the argument in the eyes of those not<br />\nsharing the ideology. The issue seems rather simple: it is<br />\ndifficult to believe that an enemy nation will not equip<br />\nits missiles with the same technology that assures us that<br />\nour missiles can penetrate their defenses. In view of this,<br />\nthe marginal utility of an ABM system is slight, given its<br />\nexpense. Stopping a .\"stray launch,\" or the fraction of<br />\nmissiles launched from submarines hardly emerge as<br />\nworthwhile goals, given the fact that we have lived with<br />\nthe first risk comfortably enough, thus far, and that<br />\nthere exists a tremendous overkill potential on the part<br />\nof nations with missile-bearing submarines.<br />\nIt is sufficient to appreciate that the technological<br />\nimpetus of a military and industrial program, given<br />\nanxiety about national defense and vested interests in<br />\norganizations and products, could lead to an enormous<br />\nexpenditure for a technically ineffective \"protective\"<br />\nsystem, particularly since there is no feasible way of<br />\ntesting that system in action. We already have an<br />\nexample of such an impetus in the case of the manned<br />\nspace-flight program, Apollo.<br /><br />\nEven those who are concerned mainly with<br />\nnational defense rather than humanitarian goals should<br />\nbe able to find merit in the argument that the money for<br />\nan ineffective ABM system would be better spent<br />\nupgrading the human resources of our country. I<br />\ncertainly hope that such persons will give serious<br />\nconsideration to this issue on March 4th and on other<br />\ndays as well, and not be put off by the unfortunate turn<br />\nthat is sometimes taken in publicizing proposed activities<br />\non March 4th. The purpose of that day should be to<br />\npause and think, and not to \"stop research\" or \"strike\".<br />\nThe rhetorical mentality of such publicity is that people<br />\ncan only be prompted by destructive emotions, that<br />\nresearch is the enemy and is not even important, and<br />\nthat the university's classes are an appropriate target for<br />\naction because they are at hand and vulnerable. Instead<br />\nof strengthening intellectual institutions that could<br />\nsucceed in influencing national policy, this trend is<br />\nanti-intellectual. (Cramer's News-Letter article was a<br />\nrefreshing exception to this trend.) Some of the<br />\npublicity has also undermined support for this most<br />\nserious issue by linking it to issues that are more<br />\nquestionable, such as secret research on campus and, by<br />\nimplication, ROTC. Many people recognize that it is<br />\nvaluables to have civilian scientist participation in<br />\nmilitary projects, and by the better scientists, in order to<br />\nhave the civilian viewpoint adequately represented in the<br />\nformation of policy. Indeed, it could be said that it is<br />\nmainly as a result of civilian scientist participation in<br /><br />\nABM research and the AEC that we have come to<br />\nquestion on a broad public scale the wisdom of an ABM<br />\nsystem.<br />\nStudents today probably do not recall that it was<br />\nnecessary to fight to obtain civilian control of atomic<br />\nenergy, in order not to have it completely under military<br />\ncontrol. Those who advocate the withdrawal of<br />\nuniversity scientists from military-related research would<br />\ndestroy the most effective monitoring system we have<br />\nfor control over that research. Similarly, those who<br />\nblindly attack ROTC seem not to appreciate that the<br />\n\"civilianizing\" effect of ROTC officers on the military is<br />\nat least as great as any \"militarizing\" effect of ROTC<br />\ntraining on ROTC candidates. Unless one wishes to do<br />\naway altogether with the Army, it seems ill-advised to<br />\nattack ROTC. The question of whether we should have<br />\nan Army is, of course, as legitimate as any other issue,<br />\nbut it is irresponsiblt to raise this issue without coupling<br />\nit to a well-worked out policy for the fate of Americans<br />\nin a world of nations without an international legal<br />\nsystem backed by an enforcement agency. The \"crunch\"<br />\nof world overpopulation, for example, over which the<br />\nUnited States has little control, and which is mainly<br />\naggravated by simple humanitarian efforts like giving<br />\nfood, may occur during the lifetime of the present<br />\ncollege generation.

Council representatives met with the<br />\nAcademic Council Wednesday night, and after the usual parliamentary<br />\nbickering of those elder, elder statesmen, they procured an agreement to<br />\nvote on calendar reform in time to implement for next year.<br />\nWe urge the Student Council to make it clear to all faculty members<br />\ninvolved that a call for a student strike is a certainty should the Academic<br />\nCouncil or General Assembly of faculty members decide against calendar<br />\nreform. The Academic Council refused to give undergraduate and graduate<br />\nstudents anything but token representation on committees which decide<br />\nPolicy relevant to student affairs. If \"student agitation\" is the only<br />\nexpression of student opinion which the Academic Council can<br />\nunderstand, it is they who have dictated such an approach.<br />\nThe Student Council has decided to lead and perhaps, by this<br />\ndecision they are spelling out a new direction for themselves. In this<br />\nmatter, we support the Council and applaud them for their initiative.<br /><br />\n... And the March 4 Strike<br />\nThe Ad Hoc Committee of Concerned Scholars, Scientists, and<br />\nFaculty, in existence for a scant two weeks, continues to pick up support<br />\nfor the March 4 \"research stoppage\" strike. The strike is aimed at the<br />\ngovernment's \"misuse of science') and the University's connection with<br />\nmilitary research.<br />\nOf great importance, is the educational goals of the Ad Hoc<br />\nCommittee. We would hope that the Committee succeeds in alerting the<br />\nHopkins community to the wider implications of University complicity in<br />\nmilitary research as well as nationally relevant issues, such as the proposed<br />\nAnti-Ballistic Missile system (ABM) which is currently under<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nOur only bone of contention, however, concerns the right of faculty<br />\nand teaching assistants to arbitrarily use class time to discuss these issues.<br />\nThe scholars who comprise the Ad Hoc Committee are the same people<br />\nWho have held that students should be given a voice in curriculum and<br />\nPolicy decisions.

SDS, trhough its recent list of<br />\ndemands and Wednesday's boycott of Levering, has once again tried to<br />\n\"radicalize\" the campus by leaping enthusiastically into the workers'<br />\ndispute.<br />\nOur interest in this affair is not a lengthy discussion concerning the<br />\nrelative merits of SDS's demands; rather, we are amused by the latest<br />\nadventures of that same organization, which, a year ago, capped its career<br />\nby lying in wait for the Dow Chemical recruiter and subsequently failing<br />\nto find him.<br />\nAfter the worker's situation had been in the news for approximately<br />\na month, SDS apparently thought it had a fine opportunity to bring the<br />\n\"third world students\", black-versus-white issue, which has been<br />\neminently successful on other campuses, to Homewood. In a \"Boycott<br />\nLevering\" flyer this week, SDS noted the close association it had been<br />\nmaintaining with black Hopkins workers. Embarassingly enough, SDS was<br />\ninformed that the Hopkins workers were not interested in their support<br />\n(and accompanying demands on their behalf), and black undergraduate<br />\nand graduate students possibly less interested. William Walker, leader of<br />\nthe workers, refused to speak at the SDS rally. SDS had dropped off a<br />\ncopy of their demands with Dr. Gordon\u2014this being somewhat akin to<br />\nLuxembourg informing the U.S. Government that they expect the eastern<br />\nseaboard to be ceded to them by next week.<br />\nAs we said some time ago, the revolution still seems a long time off,<br />\nand until then, all we can expect is occasional comic relief.<br /><br />\ntii&amp;HAVYT BE613 A9&lt;69'OUT TO<br />\nPIMER.

Some commentators, such as Walter<br />\nLippman and Raymond Moley, have indicated that<br />\nWilson would still be read even if he had never gone into<br />\npolitics. Others, such as Harry Elmer Barnes, have taken<br />\nthe position that Wilson was a minor scholar and that<br />\nthe subsequent importance of his public career is<br />\nresponsible for any continued interest in his work.<br />\nOf primary importance is that Wilson scattered his<br />\nintellectual shot; he wrote some political science, some<br />\nhistory and some cultural essays. His best book was<br />\nun deniably his doctoral thesis at Johns Hopkins,<br />\nCongressional Government, which still stands as the<br />\nmost incisive and entertaining critique of the era when<br />\npresidents would not lead. His second most notable<br />\nwork is The State, a pioneering work in the analysis of<br />\ncomparative government.<br />\nWilson's historical production is far less notable.<br />\nHis most ambitious work, the five- volume History of<br />\nthe American People, is notable for devoting more space<br />\nto social and intellectual history than the average<br /><br />\nnational history of that period. However, Wilson's<br />\nhistory lacks the novelty of conception in Congressional<br />\nGovernment. Very few of his'judgments and conclusions<br />\nwould differ from those of a high school textbook. Since<br />\nWilson's time there have been major re-interpretations of<br />\nsuch areas as Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democracy,<br />\nthe Reconstruction Period and the circumstances of<br />\nimmigration. Wilson passed on all these areas, but he did<br />\nnot have a share in the formulation of new judgments.<br /><br />\n\u2014There was a deepening of the movement toward<br />\nblack pride and the control and improvement of the<br />\nNegro neighborhoods.<br />\n\u2014There had been a great increase of concern<br />\namong whites about the problems of the slums, but<br />\nNegro and white Americans remained far apart in their<br />\nperception of the causes and meanings of civil disorders.<br />\n\u2014The physical distance between the places where<br />\nNegroes and whites lived had not diminished during the<br />\nyear and was likely to increase with population growth.<br />\nNo Way Out?<br />\n\"The black neighborhoods in the cities remain<br />\nslums marked by poverty and decay, and the ghettoes<br />\nmarked by concentration and confinement,\" the<br />\nsummary said.<br />\n\"The nation has not yet made available to the<br />\ncities, or the blacks themselves, the resources to improve<br />\ntheses neighborhoods enough to make a significant<br />\nchange in the residents' lives. Nor has it offered those<br />\nwho might want it as the alternative of escape.\"<br />\nIn its chapter on the future of cities, the Kerner<br />\nCommission had said that if the current policies were<br />\ncontinued, there was a likelihood that the nation could<br />\nkeep disorders from spreading into major riots through<br />\nthe use of \"prompt and disciplined use of force.\" This is<br />\nwhat happened in 1968, the study showed.<br />\nSecond Warning<br />\nFor the long run, the commission warned:<br />\n\"To continue present policies is to make<br />\npermanent the divisions of our country into two<br />\nsocieties: One largely Negro and poor, located in the<br />\ncentral cities; the other, predominantly white and<br />\naffluent, located in the suburbs and outlying areas.\"<br />\nThe commission called for policies that would<br />\nenrich the slums and make it possible and attractive for<br />\nNegroes to move out \"according to his capabilities and<br />\ndesires, not his color.\"<br />\nThe conclusion that polarization had continued<br />\nwas not shared by all members.

This ranges<br />\nfrom being the best in the music business today to being<br />\ngenerally the arts-iest foursome in the history of the<br />\nworld (citing John's writing and drawing as evidence of<br />\ndiversity). The myth is snowballing so quickly that huge<br />\nsegments of the of the population who give music nary a<br />\nthought all day long, are forced into admitting that the<br />\nBeatles are, in fact, The Best. \"Yea, man, Johnson's the<br />\nworst and the Beatles are the best.\"<br />\nReally?

That is the essence ofthe Beatles'<br />\nsuccess and what they will go down in History for. Yes,<br />\nthat and Yoko Ono's body.<br />\nTry the following experiment.

It is a<br />\ntruly repulsive film - badly staged, badly<br />\nacted, and badly directed, the<br />\nconsequence of a shallow, exploitative<br />\nintelligence.<br /><br />\nSick Plot<br />\n\"Joanna\" is the story of an<br />\neighteen year old girl who conies to<br />\nLondon, goes to art school, spends her<br />\nevenings sleeping with an assortment of<br />\nmen, gets pregnant by a black night club<br />\nowner who subsequently goes to jail for<br />\nmanslaughter, and finally goes home.<br />\nThere is a bit of Lester, Fellini,<br />\nAntonioni and Brecht thrown in with a<br />\ndab of instant existentialism to make<br />\nthe audience say \"how profound, how<br /><br />\nprofound\". There are scenes of<br />\nMoroccan beaches with lots of misic to<br />\nmake us feel the full meaning,<br />\nintermingled with talk on life, death,<br />\npeople, committment (\"People...people<br />\nare such beautiful things.\"). These and<br />\nthe Felliniesque fantasies are so bad that<br />\nthey make one long for Doris and Rock.<br />\nThey make the beach scenes in \"A Man<br />\nand a Woman\" seem austere and even<br />\ncynical in comparison. I kept searching,<br />\nin vain, for something to tell me this<br />\nwas all a put-on.<br />\nNo Talent<br />\nGenevieve Waite, who plays<br />\nJoanna, is one of the least talented<br />\nactresses I have ever come across. It is<br />\nhard to imagine anyone with less range.<br />\nEwa Aulin's )(Candy) ineptness is<br />\ntolerable since no one, including she,<br />\npretends that she can act. But someone<br />\nseems to have given Miss Waite the<br />\nimpression that she can. Which reveals a<br />\nproblem of tht whole movie. Somewhere<br />\nalong the line everyone got seduced by<br />\ntheir superficial ability and got carried<br />\naway. Another thing about Miss Waite it is not often I see a star who I want so<br />\nbadly to keep her clothes on.<br /><br />\nThis is Michael Sarne's first movie.<br />\nHe has taken a common plot - girl<br />\ncoming to mod world of London, used<br />\nother director's devices, thrown in<br />\noodles of sex and talk about<br />\n\"profound\" things, exploited the new<br />\nfreedom of showing black and white<br />\npeople in bed with each other, and<br />\ncome oil' with a slick, rotten<br />\ncommercial film. His camera proficiency<br />\nis for showing off. His tricks dominate<br />\nthe scenes instead of clarifying them.<br />\nI Hated It<br />\nIt is impossible to speak of<br />\n\"Joanna\" as a failure the way one<br />\nwould of \"How I Won the War\". In<br />\nLester's film I was always aware of real<br />\nintelligence, and I left with the feeling<br />\nthat someday he might do ,something<br />\nreally fine. There is no such feeling with<br />\n\"Joanna\". I never got the impression of<br />\nany sensitivity anywhere.<br />\nSince \"Joanna\" has been much<br />\npraised,\u2022 it becomes (like \"Zita\",\"Belle<br />\nde Jour\", \"Faces\") a way of clarifying<br />\nwhich. film critics one can trust.

It would be impossible<br />\nto conduct a discussion on the quality of ROTC courses<br />\nwith Mr. Zeh, the News\u2014Letter, or indeed with most<br />\nfaculty members and students because they know littel<br />\nif anything about the ROTC program.

Playing from memory, they exhibited a unanimity<br />\nof expression which allowed them to achieve this level of<br />\nperfection without sacrificing depth of feeling.<br />\nHayden's Quartet irt C major,\"The Bird\", Opus 33<br />\nnumber 3, was performed with a style typical of the<br />\nensemble, a style which emphasizes the qualities of the<br />\ncomposition over variation of phrasing and individual<br />\nvirtuosity. The exception to this was Mr. Novak who was<br />\ngiven ample opportunity to demonstrate his profound<br />\ninsight into the intentions of the composer.<br />\nJanacek's Quartet number 2,\"Intimate Pages\" and<br />\nSmetana's Quartet in E minor,\"From My Life\" are very<br />\ncharacteristic of the Czech school of composition. The<br />\nbouncing bows in the presto passages and the adaption<br />\nof folk tunes are in the tradition of Central European<br />\nstring performance.<br />\nJanacek is an impressionist and the second<br />\nmovement of his Quartet contains a rhythm which seems<br />\nto be a parody of the Vienese composers. This piece is a<br />\nconglomeration of elements which makes it difficult to<br />\nclassify, although it is an enjoyable work.<br />\nBedrich Smetana is, with Dvorak, the epitome of<br />\nCzech music. The ensemble .took this opportunity to<br />\ngive a dramatic and driving rendition of their<br /><br />\nLeveringHall<br /><br />\ncountryman and namesake's autobiographical essay. The<br />\nsecond movement of this Quartet is of particularly<br />\nspecial interest. Marked \"Allegro Moderato a la Polka\",<br />\nit typifies the mood of the entire composition.<br />\nAn enthusiastic response from the audience to the<br />\nQuartet's performance produced an encore, the third<br />\nmovement of Mozart's Quartet in D minor, Kockel<br />\nlisting 421.<br />\nThe Quartet throughout performed with a balance<br />\nand unity of feeling that is, no doubt, the result of their<br />\nhaving played together since before their graduation<br />\nfrom the Prague Academy of Music in 1945.

Those who would improve<br />\nmankind are too frequently oblivious to the fact that the<br />\nfreedom to direct their own lives to this end, or indeed<br />\nto any goal, is directly dependent upon their ability to<br />\ndefend their right to do so.<br />\nThose who oppose military training on campus<br />\ncontend that ROTC studies the unleashing of violence<br />\nand encourages the \"killer instinct.\" The study of crime<br />\ndoes no make one a criminal, but such endeavor is<br />\nnecessary if crime is to be understood and effective<br />\nmeasures developed against it. Similarly, the study of<br />\nviolence does not make one a violent person. Force and<br />\nviolence have been catalysts in human existence<br />\nthroughout history, both for good and evil. But now,<br />\nbecause of the current ability of nations to unleash more<br />\nthan sufficient force to obliterate the earth, the study of<br />\nthe control of violence and force is of paramount<br />\nimportance, and hence such studies are a legitimate area<br />\nof academic endeavor. In fact, the omission of such a<br />\ncourse of study would be \"antithetical to any notion of<br />\na great University.\"<br />\nThe ability to control force and use it wisely,<br />\nwhen its use is indicated for the preservation and<br />\nmaintenance of rights and freedoms, is the underlying<br />\ntheme of ROTC instruction. Furthermore, no one is<br />\nmore familiar with the horrors of war than those in the<br />\nmilitary, and thes very implication that military<br />\npersonnel \"get a charge\" out of killing and destruction is<br />\npure bunk. Instead of encouragement of a \"killer<br />\ninstinct\", ROTC cadets are appraised of the fact that<br />\npeace must be subscribed to by all parties, and until such<br />\ntime as it is, force and violence may be required to<br />\ndefend freedom. Whether a cadet would be able to kill<br />\nanother human being is a moot question;certainly few if<br />\nany have a desire to find out.<br />\nFinally, when a news medium is financed by a<br />\nminority, it may print what it desires, which is<br />\nconsistent with the right of free speech.

Heyssel, the head of the<br />\nnewly created Office of Health Care<br />\nPrograms. According to Dr. Heyssel, the<br />\nPlans announced earlier this month are<br />\nno coincidence. \"We do have a<br />\ncommittment in the direction of family<br />\nhealth care\", he stated. \"I think we all<br />\nwant to deliver the fruits of our research<br />\nefforts to the public for their benefit.\"<br /><br />\nA second reason for the program,<br />\naccording to the Health Care Director, is<br />\nto'enhance \"our own education system;<br />\nto allow the 80% of our graduates who<br />\ngo into practice to receive practical<br />\nstudies in health care\".<br />\nThe East Baltimore program was<br />\nestablished for a number of reasons.<br />\n\"The people in the community around<br />\nthe Hospital, and I think rightfully so,<br />\nwant facilities in their neighborhoods.<br />\nTransportation to the Hospital now is<br />\nvery difficult for many\", Heyssel noted.<br />\n\"Also the clinic system is organized into<br />\nspecialties rather than family care. The<br />\npeople find it hard to get into the clinic<br />\nsystem for minor, non-complicated<br />\nillnesses.\" Thus Jong hours and quick,<br />\nimpersonal service many times resulted<br />\nfrom the present system, the director<br />\nsaid.<br />\nPatients Consulted<br />\nThe associate director of the<br />\nHealth Care Office is Dr. Torrey C.<br />\nBrown. He is presently in charge of<br />\ndeveloping out-of-hospital health care<br />\nprograms in East Baltimore. Dr. Brown's<br />\ninitial efforts will be planning a<br />\ncomprehensive system for the residents<br />\naround the Hospital using the resources<br /><br />\nof the city health department, other<br />\nhospitals and existing service agencies.<br />\nThe .backbone of the plans, however,<br />\nwill be determined by the local<br />\ninhabitants.<br />\nDrs. Heyssel and Brown are now<br />\nnegotiating with government officials<br />\nand other sources for funds. Heyssel<br />\nestimates that the physical cost of the<br />\nhealth centers would exceed $500,000,<br />\nwith medical equipment greatly<br />\nincreasing this cost. \"This requires<br />\ncooperation with other hospitals and<br />\ngovernment loans to pay the bills\", he<br />\nemphasized.<br />\nIn the next 6 months, Dr. Heyssel<br />\nhopes to develop these Model Families<br />\nCare Programs in the East Baltimore<br />\nneighborhoods with 20,000 persons<br />\neventually receiving medical care. Also,<br />\nancillary services such as vocational<br />\nrehabilitation and social service are<br />\nplanned to supplement their program.<br />\nThe Hopkins Hospital has opened<br />\nup a minor illness section in their<br />\nemergency ward recently. It operates 5<br />\ndays a week on a half-time basis, and<br />\nhas cut the patient's waiting time<br />\naccording to Dr. Heyssel. Additional<br />\nalterations are being formulated for the<br />\nHospital, the director stated.<br /><br />\nSTRAIGHT MAN WANTED<br />\nLOOKING FOR MALE STUDENT, 21 OR<br />\nOLDER, WHO WOULD LIKE TO TRY PLAYING<br />\nSTRAIGHT MAN IN A COMEDY TEAM WITH<br />\nEVENTUAL GOAL OF PERFORMING AT U.S.<br />\nARMY SERVICE CLUBS AND UNIVERSITIES.<br />\nIF INTERESTED DROP A CARD IN CARE<br />\nOF THE NEWS-LETTER BOX 1230, STATE AGE,<br />\nEDUCATION, AVAILABILITY, ADDRESS &amp;<br />\nPHONE NUMBER FOR CAMPUS INTERVIEW.<br /><br />\nThe Columbia program will<br />\ninvolve the construction of a hospital<br />\nand related clinics in the newly built<br />\ncity, and operated by the administrative<br />\nand medical staff of Hopkins. Persons<br />\nenrolled in the plan will receive medical<br />\nservices including hospitalization, office<br />\nvisits to physicians, home care,<br />\ndiagnostic services, and regular medical<br />\ncheckups.<br />\nLater in 1969 Hopkins expects to<br />\nestablish the clinical facilities in<br />\nColumbia and begin to render care. The<br />\nConnecticut General Life Insurance<br />\nCompany has agreed to underwrite a<br />\nconstruction loan of $3.75 million and<br />\nwill assume the risk of operating deficits<br />\nduring the development years *of the<br />\nprogram. Dr. Heyssel said the upper<br />\nlimits of the medical plan would cost a<br />\nfamily of three or more between<br />\n$40-$45 a month. Less coverage would<br />\ncost less. In all, the director of the<br />\nproject estimates that 30,000-50,000<br />\npersons will eventually enroll in the<br />\nColumbia program.<br />\nDr. Lincoln Gordon and Dr.<br />\nRussell A. Nelson, the Hospital<br />\npresident said of the program, \"The<br />\nassociation of a university medical<br />\ncenter with a large insurance company<br />\nshould develop patterns applicable to<br />\nmany parts of the nation.\"<br />\nThe Health Services Research<br />\nCenter will analyze and evaluate the<br />\nsuccess of the newly-formed health care<br />\nprograms. The research center will be<br />\neither wholly or partially financed by<br />\nthe National Center for Health Services.<br />\nAccording to Heyssel, the center will<br />\n\"look at the consumer acceptance of<br />\nour programs, and it will devise new<br />\nways of doing things in the health<br />\nfield.\"<br />\nST/....,1 KS<br />\nSEA FOOD1<br />\nSUBMARINES<br />\nDOUBLEB 1RGERS<br />\nEAT-IN OR CARRY-OUT<br />\nST.

He noted that<br />\nironically most of the people that the programs are<br />\ndesigned to help are semi-literate and tend to give up in<br />\ndisgust when they are referred in an endless process from.<br />\none agency to the next.<br />\nAccordingly, the Model Cities Program is designed<br />\n\"to stress coordination of all federally assisted programs<br />\nin the Model Cities neighborhood, \"and to innovate by<br />\nutilizing widespread citizen participation in planning and<br />\nexecuting at all levels of decisionmaking.<br />\nBaltimore is ready to begin the final stage of the<br />\nexecution<br />\nModel Cities Program, a five year period of<br />\nbeen<br />\nhave<br />\ncouncils<br />\nty<br />\ncommuni<br />\nbeginning in 1969.

It's a big city which<br />\nis corrupt.\"<br />\nCarter pointed to the inequities of the planned<br />\nEast-West Expressway which would \"recongest people in<br />\norder for some people to ride cool up and down the<br />\nstreets uncongested.\" Seven hundred million dollars,<br />\nnine times the five-year Model Cities budget, is being<br />\nspent to construct the new expressway.<br />\nBaltimore can get away with this, according to<br />\nCarter, because there is as yet \"no national commitment<br />\nto really rebuild and revitalize the city.\" Nor are there<br />\nenough funds \"going into cementing an economic base<br />\nfor the ghetto.\"<br />\nHowever, Carter rejected the black capitalism<br />\nconcept in favor of business cooperatives, because there<br />\n\"shouldn't be competition for the basic requirements of<br />\nexisting.\"<br /><br />\nBaltimore will be awarded a $10.5 million<br />\ngrant by the Department of Housing and Urban<br />\nAffairs next month for the first year of the<br />\nfive-year Model Cities Program. \u2022<br />\nThe nationwide $900 million program has<br />\napproved the Baltimore project,:, and, according to<br />\nModel City officials, aid will be available Eometirne in<br />\nMarch.

The Baltimore Model Cities officials<br />\ntherefore expect increased financial aid from the<br />\ngovernment every year.

BALTIMORE, FEB. 28, 1969<br /><br />\nVarsity Five Falls to Terrors<br />\nIn Ciccarone's Final Contest<br /><br />\nJay's<br />\nNest<br />\nBy RICH HOLLANDER<br />\nSports Editor<br />\nVarsity basketball coach!<br />\nHenry Ciccarone is trading his<br />\nwhistle and playbook for the gray<br />\nflannel suit of the business world.<br />\nHe is vacating his athletic center<br />\ndesk after a Hopkins' career which<br />\nhas spanned a decade as both a<br />\nplayer and coach.<br />\nMr. Ciccarone presented his<br />\nresignation last September after<br />\nsix campaigns at the varsity helm.<br />\nHis future, as yet undecided, will<br />\nprobably be in the business world,<br />\nwhere opportunity knocks louder<br />\nthan in coaching. \"1 have to<br />\nsatisfy myself and make it big in<br />\nsomething else.\" Marshall Turner Coach Ciccarone watches his team<br />\naccepted his resignation.<br />\nperform against Western Marylanu.<br />\nFrom Annapolis to Homewood<br />\nA legendary athlete at Hopkins, \"Cic\" lettered in football and<br />\nlacrosse three times each. An All Mason-Dixon tailback, he guided<br />\nthe passing attack from the old single wing. Although hampered by a<br />\nknee injury, \"Cic\" held the most completed passes record until it<br />\nwas exlipsed by Jim Feely this year. Against Hampden-Sydney \"Cic\"<br />\nthrew three touchdown strikes Co a 6'5\" end Darwin Kim.<br />\nRecovering from his injury a News-Letter banner head read,<br />\n\"Ciccarone Returns To Face Terrors\".<br />\nNo less of a sensation with a lacrosse stick, \"Cic\" took<br />\nMI-American honors in every varsity season. In 1962 he set- a<br />\nphenomenal scoring record for midfielders with 25 goals and as<br />\nmany assists. During a senior year visit to Virginai, the Jay<br />\nmidfielder splurged for 5 goals and 2 assists.<br />\nDespite the gridiron and lacrosse heroics \"Cic\" became a<br />\nbasketball coach. The man who hired him, Marshall Turner, claims:<br />\n\"He thought, studied and acted like a coach. He has talent and<br />\nnatural ability and could be successful in coaching any sport.\"<br />\nHopkins' basketball has been mediocre. Coach Ciccarone has<br />\nattempted to upgrade the program but the administration has put<br />\nthe financial brakes to this goal. Athletic scholarships are, of course,<br />\nout of the question. Yet the basketball equipment is inferior and the<br />\nschedule is a disaster. After practicing six weeks the varsity plays<br />\nfour games before Christmas, followed by the final and intersession<br />\nbreak and the pro pace of February. Furthermore the administration<br />\nrefuses to subsidize the players staying in town during vacation as<br />\nwell as sanctioning Christmas tournaments and a northern swing.<br />\nIt's ironic that \"Cic's\" greatest basketball achievement will<br />\ntake place after he leaves. This year's superlative frosh hoopsters,<br />\nwhich he recruited, will make the Jays big winners next year. With<br />\nonly the captains leaving and the ascension of Grinberg, Lally, Apple<br />\nand Handleman, the new coach can thank \"Cic\" for many a future<br />\nvictory.<br />\nA snow-whipped night before finals in 1967 marked coach<br />\n\"Cic's\" most satisfying moment. Loyola had taken 24 straight from<br />\nthe Jays. With all overtime assist by Jim Calli. Joe Carlton netted the<br />\nbucket which sent the greyhounds lapping up Charles Street.<br />\nWe wish Henry Ciccarone lots of Loyola games \u2014 both the<br />\nchallenge and the triumph.<br /><br />\nTHE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY<br />\nON CAMPUS<br />\nRegular Mass Schedule<br />\nSUNDAYS ..10:30 A.M.- Shaffer Hall Rm.3<br />\nWEEKDAYS 12:05 PM.- Levering Hall Chapel<br />\n\u202211111111.0<br /><br />\nHAVE YOU MADE YOUR RESERVATION<br />\nFOR A CELEBRATION?<br /><br />\nThe Varsity Basketball team closed out its<br />\n1968-1969 season last Saturday, bowing to<br />\nWestern Maryland 96-85. This brought the<br />\nhoopsters' season record to 3-14, the poorest in<br />\nrecent years.<br />\nDuring the early part of the game, both<br />\nteams traded baskets. Halfway through the first<br />\nhalf the terrors increased their lead from 19-17<br />\nto 30-19. The maintained this lead and went off<br />\nat halftime ahead by a score of 46-36. Hopkins<br />\ncame out fired up for the second half. Jeff<br />\nThomas and John Judy controlled the boards<br />\nand Dave Rebovich and Brian Berke started<br />\nhitting from the outside as the Blue Jays closed<br />\nthe gap to 66-59. But the Terrors pulled away as<br />\nthe team hit over 60% from the floor in the<br />\nclosing minutes.<br />\nRebovich led the Hopkins scoring with 23<br />\npoints collecting 17 of them in the second half..<br />\nBerke pumped in 22. Thomas, Thorne and Judy<br />\neach had 10 points.<br />\nSaturday night's game was the final one for<br />\nBerke, captain of the Hopkins team. Berke has<br />\nscored over 1,200 points in his 4 years at<br />\nHopkins. Going into Saturday's game he needed<br />\n27 points to achieve a 19.0 average for the year,<br />\nwhich would have set a new school record. The<br />\nold record of 18.9 was set by Mone Margolis in<br />\n1953. Berke's 22 points left him five short of the<br />\nrecord. Saturday night was also the last game for<br />\nHal Thorne, the other co-captain, and John Judy,<br />\na junior who is graduating early. John did not<br />\nplay last year, but contributed greatly this<br />\nseason, doing an especially fine job when Jeff<br />\nThomas was injured.<br />\nThe Hopkins team set two records this<br /><br />\nyear. In their first game against Western<br />\nMaryland the Terrors poured in 115 points, the<br />\nmost ever scored in one game against the Blue<br />\nJays. The Varsity allowed 1420 points during the<br />\n17 game season while tallying 1183. The 83.5<br />\naverage for opponents' points in a game, broke<br />\nthe previous record of 81.3 set in 1955.<br /><br />\nBaby Jays Finish<br />\nPhenomenal Year<br />\nBy MIKE SHORE<br /><br />\nThe freshman basketball team has<br />\nfinished off a \" season which saw them<br />\nbreak forty-two team and individual<br />\nrecords, by winning games over Loyola<br />\nand Western Maryland, by scores of 93-85<br />\nand 92-76 respectively.<br />\nIt was the second victory of the season<br />\nover both of the squads. In the Loyola game the<br />\nBaby Jays went into the lockers at the half with<br />\na 43-30 lead. With five minutes left this lead had<br />\nbeen built up to 23 points. Coach Barrette then<br />\nsubstituted freely, and consequently, the final<br />\nscore was somewhat tighter than the actual game.<br />\nIt was a good defensive effort by the frosh.<br />\nThey had four men in double figures, Gary<br />\nHandleman with 24, George Apple with 18, John<br />\nLally with 19, and Hal Grinberg with 14.<br />\nOnSaturday, the Jays beat Western<br />\nMaryland in what was a very similar performance<br />\nto the Loyola game. The defense again excelled.<br />\nThis time John Lilly was the leading scorer with<br />\n26 points, and 15 rebounds. Hal Grinberg had 20<br />\nand Handleman 17.<br /><br />\nCENTER BILL PIETROWSKI sets for a charity toss in the<br />\nLoyola game.<br /><br />\nRecords Broken<br />\nThus the frosh finished off their season<br />\nwith an 11-3 record. They broke a phenomenal<br />\nnumber of records, including 28 individual and<br />\n14 team marks. Gary Handleman set seven of<br />\nthese marks, including most field goals, field<br />\ngoals attempted, free throw, free throws<br />\nattempted, free throw percentage, total points<br />\nand average number of points per game. He<br />\naveraged 26.0 points per game, taking the record<br />\naway from Brian Berke. John Lilly set the record<br />\nfor field goal percentage with a 55.3 percentage.<br />\nGeorge Alple broke varsity co-captain<br />\nHalThorne's records for assists with 82 on the<br />\nyear. The team scored 1172 points, and averaged<br />\n88.7 points per game, both records.<br /><br />\nAwards Banquet<br />\nOn Tuesday night, the frosh had their<br />\nannual awards banquet. The Most Valuable<br />\nPlayer award is shared by George Apple and Hal<br />\nGrinberg. Gary Handleman received a trophY<br />\ndespite all of his injuries.

He was not at full<br />\nstrength all year, but still made significant<br />\ncontributions to the team.<br />\nCoach Gary Barrette was full of praise for<br />\nthe team, and felt confident that many of them<br />\nwould be of great help to the varsity next year.<br /><br />\nPAGE 19<br /><br />\nNEWSLETTER<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD.

After completing a record<br />\nstudded 9-2 dual meet season, the Jays will match their<br />\nstrength against six other teams in the Mason-Dixon<br />\nChampionships at Towson State College. Trials will be<br />\nheld this afternoon and tomorrow, with the finals Friday<br />\nand Saturday night.<br />\n. In the past, Catholic University has dominated the<br />\nentire meet, with Loyola giving them a fight in the<br />\nsprints and the relays. The remaining teams have merely<br />\ndivided the other points among themselves. This year,<br />\nhowever, a close three team contest is in the offing with<br />\nLoyola and Hopkins challenging Catholics supremacy..<br />\nI5uring practice this week, Coach Frank Comfort<br />\nexpressed confidence in the ability of his swimmers to<br />\nwin the conference crown. Last year Hopkins won only<br />\nthe two butterfly events and the diving, with Howard<br />\nChernick and Rick- Wilson respectively. This year,<br />\nComfort's guarded i-citimism is based on the strength of'<br />\nthe Jays in several other events: Here is a brief summary<br />\nof the Hopkins lineup and relative strength:medley<br />\nrelay, Scott, O'Donnell, Chernick,. Turner-probablefirst<br />\nprovided Scott can recover from his ear infection; 50<br />\nand 100 free, Turner and Burnham- will surprise many,<br />\nalthough not the\" strongest event in the Hopkins lineup;<br />\n200 and 500 free, Weikel will place high in the 200,<br />\nwhile Fisher and Kuffner may both sneak into the 500<br />\nfinal; 1650-Weikel and Kuffner- good chance for a first<br />\nfrom Weikel, Kuffner may also place; Butterfly,<br />\nChernick and Solomon - Prospects for a sweep of both<br />\nfly events are excellent; backstroke - Weikel, Scott,<br />\nFisher-Could go as high as two-three in both events;<br />\nbreaststroke- O'Donnell, Ware, Treem-Two more firsts<br />\nfor the Jays and a possible sweep in the 100; 400 free<br />\nrelay - (Ware, Weikel, Turner, Burnham) will probably<br />\nscore from third to first; 800 free relay (Fisher, Weikel,<br />\nWare, Solomon)- again the Jays will place somewhere in<br />\nthe top three; Diving- Wilson is favored again, Myers if<br />\nhot may place; Lndividual Medley-Ware, Solomon,<br />\nFisher-probably 2,3 ik the 400 and 3,4 in the 200.<br />\nThe Jays have bben hurt by a ruling which limits<br />\nentries per event to two'per team. This negates Hopkins'<br />\ndepth in butterfly, backsiroke, and individual medley<br />\nwhile helping teams such us Loyola and Catholic with<br />\nme and possibly two top notch swimmers: Therefore,<br />\nttie finals will, for the most part, resemble a triangular<br />\nmeet between Catholic, Loyola, and Hopkins. Earlier<br />\nthis year Hopkins beat Catholic in-a scrimmage and lost<br />\nto Loyola in a dual meet. The Loyola coath thinks his<br />\nteam to be meet favorites.
