It has acknowledged for the first time<br />\nthat there are inadequacies in undergraduate education<br />\nhere, and has implicitly placed its support behind future<br />\nreforms.<br />\nThe Council's most dramatic (or unexpected)<br />\nproposal was that \"teaching in all its aspects, from<br />\nundergraduate to post-doctoral, as well as research and<br />\nscholarship, provides criteria for appointment and<br />\npromotion in the University.\" Although this certainly is<br />\na concession considering Homewood's traditional<br />\nemphasis on research, the report carefully ignored the<br />\nStudent Council's resolution that equal weight be given<br />\nto teaching and research.<br />\nThe A.C. also hedged on the one-professor, one-course<br />\nproposal.\"Some departments do not meet the suggested<br />\nstandard of one undergraduate course per full-time<br />\nfaculty member,\" the Council noted, while placing the<br />\nburden of this controversial idea on the advisory Blue<br />\nRibbon Panel. The array of introductory and advanced<br />\nundergrad courses was also referred to the BRP. And<br />\nwhether or not Social Relations should offer an<br />\nundergraduate major was left for future Academic<br />\nCouncil meetings.<br />\nIn short this means that the need for reform in the<br />\nundergraduate program, confronted at last, will still<br />\ntake a long time to implement. Except for freshman<br />\nseminars and a few new courses, there probably will not<br />\nbe a dramatic change in undergrad education next fall.<br />\nMaybe the most serious flaw of the Academic Council<br />\nreport is its myopic view of the student's place in<br />\nconsidering educational reforms. Ironically, the<br />\nCouncil, while expressing sympathy for the plight of<br />\nundergrads, has overlooked methods whereby students<br />\ncould voice their gripes instead of, in desperation<br />\nthreatening tuition strikes or lawsuits.<br />\n<br />\nA Small Suggestion<br />\nBeneath the fervor of the Student Council-Academic<br />\nCouncil hassles over courses and teaching rules, a basic<br />\npsychological problem<br />\nremains unresolved.<br />\nUndergraduates have lost their affiliation with Hopkins.<br />\nThey go to classes, then return to off-campus<br />\napartments, occasionally stopping at Levering. By and<br />\nlarge, they have no intellectual home, lest it be the<br />\nlibrary. They are isolated, and quite rightly angry or<br />\napathetic. Education here has become as academically<br />\nstagnant as at those high schools where bells mark off<br />\nthe allotted time for English, chemistry and history<br />\nevery day.<br />\nUndergraduate lounges in the academic buildings<br />\ncould go a long way to alleviate this lack of community.<br />\nHopefully, grad students and professors would also<br />\nfrequent these rooms, fostering informal \"education\"<br />\nand interpersonal contacts. As we envision them, there<br />\nwould be facilities for establishing a base of operations<br />\naway from home--each student with his own cubbyhole,<br />\nso to speak.<br />\nWe urge the Blue Ribbon Panel and its parent<br />\ncommittee, the Academic Council, to carefully examine<br />\nthis idea. With the new administration building near<br />\ncompletion, Homewood should certainly have enough<br />\nnet space to spare a few lounge areas. Such rooms were<br />\npresent in the 1940's and 50's before Homewood became<br />\nblindly absorbed with its expansion and, according to<br />\nold-timers, were very successful.<br />\nAs Dr. John White recently told the Faculty<br />\nAssembly, \"Undergraduates now just emerge on the<br />\nfirst day of class, and then disappear at the end of the<br />\nsemester. No one seems to know where they come<br />\nfrom.\"<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\n\"These Helicopters Are Comparatively Safe.<br />\nAren't They?\"<br />\n<br />\nAsinineLaw<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nMy two brief personal<br />\nencounters with your paper<br />\nhave led me to conclude that<br />\nthe News-Letter seldom if<br />\never, exceeds 60 per cent<br />\naccuracy. In typical fashion<br />\nyour March 9th editorial<br />\nconcerning sections 553 and<br />\n554 of the Maryland Criminal<br />\nCode also missed the point.<br />\nPlease note that the statute,<br />\nas you have quoted it, says,\"<br />\nEvery person who shall be<br />\nconvicted of (oral-genital<br />\nactivity)...\" shall be fined or<br />\nimprisoned.<br />\nThis idiotic law affects<br />\nheterosexuals<br />\nand<br />\nhomosexuals equally. In fact,<br />\nif it were to be enforced more<br />\nthan half the state would be in<br />\nprison. You will note that the<br />\nlaw, as quoted, makes no<br />\nexception<br />\nfor<br />\nmarried<br />\ncouples. In your quixotic<br />\nattack on the laws and the<br />\nUniversity's \"coldness and<br />\nhostility\" you have missed<br />\nthe asininity of the state's<br />\nattempt to regulate the<br />\nsexual behavior of everyone,<br />\nhetero-and<br />\nhomo-sexual<br />\nalike.<br />\nIn an equally superficial<br />\nfashion you seem to assume<br />\nthat homosexual problems<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nare somehow \"unique\" and<br />\nthat the University should<br />\nmake some special effort to<br />\nmeet<br />\nthese<br />\n\"unique\"<br />\nproblems of an estimated 5<br />\n<br />\nper cent of the student body.<br />\nWhat about the \"unique\"<br />\nsexual problems of half the<br />\nremaining 95 per cent?<br />\n(continued on page 9)<br />\n<br />\nRace Relations<br />\n<br />\nJHI-1 Improving<br />\nN.P.J. Belitsos<br />\nIn reference to the panel discussion on<br />\n\"Racism Among the Unprejudiced\" given at<br />\nthe March 1st meeting of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Society (subsequently covered in a<br />\nNews-Letter article), I would like to express<br />\nthe following observations.<br />\nThe Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital is indeed not exempt from<br />\nthe race conflicts which plague most<br />\nAmerican institutions. It would be unfair to<br />\nexpect the hospital to be anything less than a<br />\nreflection of the society of which it is an<br />\nintegral part.<br />\nThe manifestations and inherent problems<br />\nresulting from discriminatory attitudes,<br />\nhowever, are more obvious and perhaps even<br />\nexacerbated in the arena of a health care<br />\ncenter. Harmony among all individuals<br />\nregardless of their position in the hierarchy of<br />\nthe institution is necessary for the proper<br />\nfunctioning of a hospital, which by the very<br />\nnature of its task operates most efficiently as<br />\nthe result of \"team effort.\" Also distrust and<br />\ncontempt between the community and the<br />\nhospital can lead to a severe breakdown in the<br />\npatient-doctor relationship which directly<br />\nimpedes the adequate and effective delivery<br />\nof health care.<br />\nBecause a city hospital is a source of<br />\nconstant contact between ghetto blacks and<br />\nthe whites, one might suspect that the<br />\nincidence of racism (at least of a covert<br />\nnature) would be greater than in society in<br />\ngeneral. At Hopkins Hospital there is ample<br />\nevidence of disharmony.<br />\nMrs. Rubie Glover, a Black assistant<br />\nadministrator in the hospital's emergency<br />\nroom, defined this disharmony at the Medical<br />\nSociety's meeting as \"coldness\" between<br />\nindividuals of the two groups and as covert<br />\n\"offense without meaning.\"<br />\nThe fact that the overworked house staff of<br />\nthe hospital must see large numbers ofpatients<br />\neach day affords little time for each patient to<br />\nbe treated in the most humanizing manner<br />\npossible. Patients feel that the hospital<br />\nNicholas P. J. Belitsos is a first year medical student.<br />\n<br />\npersonnel lack concern and misconstrue this<br />\nto be a result of racist attitudes. Also the fact<br />\nthat the hospital is primarily a teaching<br />\ninstitution and an important research center<br />\nrelegates the service aspect of health care to a<br />\nsubordinate position.<br />\nThis attitude alienates, demoralizes and<br />\nembitters the members of the local<br />\ncommunity who naturally consider their own<br />\ninterests first and feel that the hospital's<br />\nprimary obligation is to serve the surrounding<br />\ncommunity.This reaction is analogous to that<br />\nof the Hopkins undergraduates who perceive<br />\nthe priorities of Hopkins differently than do<br />\nthe University's administrators and faculty. '<br />\nSince the hospital is so readily confronted<br />\nwith the problems engendered by a racist<br />\nsociety, it serves as an excellent testing<br />\nground for efforts to eliminate the inequalities<br />\nand communications barriers which breed<br />\ndistrust and conflict. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital is beginning to commit itself to this<br />\npurpose. The recent Medical Society meeting<br />\ndevoted to this topic and the large number of<br />\npersons in attendance demonstrates this<br />\ncommitment.<br />\nMaking the problems known in this manner<br />\nfacilitates their solution. The hospital is also<br />\n\"going out on a limb\" in an effort to get the<br />\nnewly formulated East Baltimore Medical<br />\nPlan into action. This program is to be<br />\ngoverned by members of both the hospital and<br />\nthe community and is an excellent scheme to<br />\nhumanize and generally improve and expand<br />\nthe health care for the individuals living in<br />\nEast Baltimore's five housing projects.<br />\nThrough trial and error the hospital has<br />\nlearned that allowing the community to \"add<br />\ningredients to the cake rather than give them<br />\nthe finished product to swallow\" expedites<br />\nmatters immensely. Hopefully the hospital<br />\ncan atone for the heritage of racism which has<br />\ndampened its relationship with the<br />\nsurrounding community and between its own<br />\nmembers. I believe its recent efforts to do this<br />\nare a commendable start in that direction.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS\u2014LETTER<br />\n<br />\nMarch 12, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nInside the N-L<br />\n<br />\nWh,o Wants Yesterday's Papers?<br />\ntime to think up angles and<br />\nanalyses between the Sunday<br />\nand<br />\narid Wednesday all-night<br />\nTED ROHRLICH<br />\n,<br />\nringers.<br />\nMass media, by definition,,.

(You're laughing, but it's possible.) It is, however,<br />\na very slim chance and it will require you to do something you've<br />\nnever done before: take notes.<br />\n\\V by haven't you been taking notes? I'll tell you why. Let's suppose you're at a history lecture. Let's suppose the topic is the ruling<br />\nhouses of England. You start out tine. You put down the lecturer's<br />\npoints one after another with Roman numerals just like you're supposed to. Like this:<br />\nI. house of Plantagenet<br />\nII. House of Lancaster<br />\nIII. House of York<br />\nThen suddenly you stop. You put down your pen. You blink back<br />\na tear. You can't go on. Oh sure, you know the next ruling house is the<br />\n!louse of Tudor. What. you don't know is the Roman numeral that<br />\ncomes after ill<br />\nThere's t he !langur). those middy Roman numerals! flow come<br />\nwe keep using them when even the Romans didn't know how? Oh, I<br />\nguess they could tell you how much V or X were or like that, but when<br />\nit came to skullcrackers like 1,X I or M MC, they just Hang away their<br />\nstyluses and went downtown to have a bath or take in a circus or maybe stab Caesar a few times.<br />\nYou may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous numerals<br />\nwhen the Arabs had such a nice simple system. Well sir, the fact is that<br />\nEmperor Vespasian tried like crazy to buy the Arabic numerals from<br />\nthe Sultan, Sulieman the I I airy, but Sulieman wouldn't do business-not even when Vespasian raised his bid to 100,000 gold piasters, plus<br />\nhe offered to throw in the<br />\nthe Appian Way and Chad t on<br />\nI lesion.<br />\nC1111)sseu in,<br />\n<br />\nW..Air AP \u20224...

One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny the Elder got to arguing about how much is CD14 times M VI X. Well sir, pretty soon everybody in town came around to join the hassle. In all the excitement<br />\nnobody remembered to lock the north gate and\u2014wham! before you<br />\ncould say ars long('\u2014 in rushed the Goths, the Visigoths and the Green<br />\nBay Packers! \u2022<br />\nWell sir, that's the wvy the empire crumbles, but I digress: Let's<br />\nget back to lecture notes. Let's also say a word -about Miller High Life<br />\nBeer because the brewers of Miller High Life Beer sponsor this column<br />\nand they're inclined to sulk if I don't mention their product. Naturally, they don't sulk long, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer, for<br />\nthey are ebullient, great-spirited men, as chock-full of sunniness as the<br />\nbeer they brew. Believe me, I know. Every Tuesday I have lunch with<br />\nthem at the brewery and I've never seen such a fun place!<br />\nThe lunches always get off to a rousing start with everybody singing the Miller Pep Song which you all know, of course:<br />\nI'm a keg of Miller\u2014<br />\nI'm a keg of Miller \u2014<br />\n1 will please your palate.<br />\nSo go and get a mallet.<br />\nI'm a key of Miller\u2014<br />\nI'm a keg of Miller\u2014<br />\nI will make you feel young.<br />\nAnd bang away at my bung.<br />\nWell sir, this is only the beginning. Next, everyone gets'up in turn<br />\nand does a hilarious bit. For instance, Frank Glebe from Hops Control<br />\nimitates a chicken; Rex Gransmire from Label Gumming touches his<br />\near with his tongue; Charley Froos from Malt Flow cracks a walnut<br />\nin his armpit; Norman Berswang from Fermentation touches his armpit with his tongue; a:; you ace, just one belly-buster after another.<br />\nBut lunch ends with a tranquil and rather solemn moment. Ed<br />\nGonder, the brewery chaplain, closes the proceedings with an invocation to St. Dintenfass, the patron saint of carbon dioxide, and then<br />\nthey all return to their work renewed\u2022and inspired, just as you too will<br />\nbe after you too have enjoyed the joys of Miller High Life.

It has acknowledged for the first time<br />\nthat there are inadequacies in undergraduate education<br />\nhere, and has implicitly placed its support behind future<br />\nreforms.<br />\nThe Council's most dramatic (or unexpected)<br />\nproposal was that \"teaching in all its aspects, from<br />\nundergraduate to post-doctoral, as well as research and<br />\nscholarship, provides criteria for appointment and<br />\npromotion in the University.\" Although this certainly is<br />\na concession considering Homewood's traditional<br />\nemphasis on research, the report carefully ignored the<br />\nStudent Council's resolution that equal weight be given<br />\nto teaching and research.<br />\nThe A.C. also hedged on the one-professor, one-course<br />\nproposal.\"Some departments do not meet the suggested<br />\nstandard of one undergraduate course per full-time<br />\nfaculty member,\" the Council noted, while placing the<br />\nburden of this controversial idea on the advisory Blue<br />\nRibbon Panel. The array of introductory and advanced<br />\nundergrad courses was also referred to the BRP. And<br />\nwhether or not Social Relations should offer an<br />\nundergraduate major was left for future Academic<br />\nCouncil meetings.<br />\nIn short this means that the need for reform in the<br />\nundergraduate program, confronted at last, will still<br />\ntake a long time to implement. Except for freshman<br />\nseminars and a few new courses, there probably will not<br />\nbe a dramatic change in undergrad education next fall.<br />\nMaybe the most serious flaw of the Academic Council<br />\nreport is its myopic view of the student's place in<br />\nconsidering educational reforms. Ironically, the<br />\nCouncil, while expressing sympathy for the plight of<br />\nundergrads, has overlooked methods whereby students<br />\ncould voice their gripes instead of, in desperation<br />\nthreatening tuition strikes or lawsuits.<br /><br />\nA Small Suggestion<br />\nBeneath the fervor of the Student Council-Academic<br />\nCouncil hassles over courses and teaching rules, a basic<br />\npsychological problem<br />\nremains unresolved.<br />\nUndergraduates have lost their affiliation with Hopkins.<br />\nThey go to classes, then return to off-campus<br />\napartments, occasionally stopping at Levering. By and<br />\nlarge, they have no intellectual home, lest it be the<br />\nlibrary. They are isolated, and quite rightly angry or<br />\napathetic. Education here has become as academically<br />\nstagnant as at those high schools where bells mark off<br />\nthe allotted time for English, chemistry and history<br />\nevery day.<br />\nUndergraduate lounges in the academic buildings<br />\ncould go a long way to alleviate this lack of community.<br />\nHopefully, grad students and professors would also<br />\nfrequent these rooms, fostering informal \"education\"<br />\nand interpersonal contacts. As we envision them, there<br />\nwould be facilities for establishing a base of operations<br />\naway from home--each student with his own cubbyhole,<br />\nso to speak.<br />\nWe urge the Blue Ribbon Panel and its parent<br />\ncommittee, the Academic Council, to carefully examine<br />\nthis idea. With the new administration building near<br />\ncompletion, Homewood should certainly have enough<br />\nnet space to spare a few lounge areas.

In typical fashion<br />\nyour March 9th editorial<br />\nconcerning sections 553 and<br />\n554 of the Maryland Criminal<br />\nCode also missed the point.<br />\nPlease note that the statute,<br />\nas you have quoted it, says,\"<br />\nEvery person who shall be<br />\nconvicted of (oral-genital<br />\nactivity)...\" shall be fined or<br />\nimprisoned.<br />\nThis idiotic law affects<br />\nheterosexuals<br />\nand<br />\nhomosexuals equally.

Belitsos<br />\nIn reference to the panel discussion on<br />\n\"Racism Among the Unprejudiced\" given at<br />\nthe March 1st meeting of the Johns Hopkins<br />\nMedical Society (subsequently covered in a<br />\nNews-Letter article), I would like to express<br />\nthe following observations.<br />\nThe Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital is indeed not exempt from<br />\nthe race conflicts which plague most<br />\nAmerican institutions. It would be unfair to<br />\nexpect the hospital to be anything less than a<br />\nreflection of the society of which it is an<br />\nintegral part.<br />\nThe manifestations and inherent problems<br />\nresulting from discriminatory attitudes,<br />\nhowever, are more obvious and perhaps even<br />\nexacerbated in the arena of a health care<br />\ncenter. Harmony among all individuals<br />\nregardless of their position in the hierarchy of<br />\nthe institution is necessary for the proper<br />\nfunctioning of a hospital, which by the very<br />\nnature of its task operates most efficiently as<br />\nthe result of \"team effort.\" Also distrust and<br />\ncontempt between the community and the<br />\nhospital can lead to a severe breakdown in the<br />\npatient-doctor relationship which directly<br />\nimpedes the adequate and effective delivery<br />\nof health care.<br />\nBecause a city hospital is a source of<br />\nconstant contact between ghetto blacks and<br />\nthe whites, one might suspect that the<br />\nincidence of racism (at least of a covert<br />\nnature) would be greater than in society in<br />\ngeneral. At Hopkins Hospital there is ample<br />\nevidence of disharmony.<br />\nMrs. Rubie Glover, a Black assistant<br />\nadministrator in the hospital's emergency<br />\nroom, defined this disharmony at the Medical<br />\nSociety's meeting as \"coldness\" between<br />\nindividuals of the two groups and as covert<br />\n\"offense without meaning.\"<br />\nThe fact that the overworked house staff of<br />\nthe hospital must see large numbers ofpatients<br />\neach day affords little time for each patient to<br />\nbe treated in the most humanizing manner<br />\npossible. Patients feel that the hospital<br />\nNicholas P. J. Belitsos is a first year medical student.<br /><br />\npersonnel lack concern and misconstrue this<br />\nto be a result of racist attitudes. Also the fact<br />\nthat the hospital is primarily a teaching<br />\ninstitution and an important research center<br />\nrelegates the service aspect of health care to a<br />\nsubordinate position.<br />\nThis attitude alienates, demoralizes and<br />\nembitters the members of the local<br />\ncommunity who naturally consider their own<br />\ninterests first and feel that the hospital's<br />\nprimary obligation is to serve the surrounding<br />\ncommunity.This reaction is analogous to that<br />\nof the Hopkins undergraduates who perceive<br />\nthe priorities of Hopkins differently than do<br />\nthe University's administrators and faculty. '<br />\nSince the hospital is so readily confronted<br />\nwith the problems engendered by a racist<br />\nsociety, it serves as an excellent testing<br />\nground for efforts to eliminate the inequalities<br />\nand communications barriers which breed<br />\ndistrust and conflict. The Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital is beginning to commit itself to this<br />\npurpose. The recent Medical Society meeting<br />\ndevoted to this topic and the large number of<br />\npersons in attendance demonstrates this<br />\ncommitment.<br />\nMaking the problems known in this manner<br />\nfacilitates their solution. The hospital is also<br />\n\"going out on a limb\" in an effort to get the<br />\nnewly formulated East Baltimore Medical<br />\nPlan into action. This program is to be<br />\ngoverned by members of both the hospital and<br />\nthe community and is an excellent scheme to<br />\nhumanize and generally improve and expand<br />\nthe health care for the individuals living in<br />\nEast Baltimore's five housing projects.<br />\nThrough trial and error the hospital has<br />\nlearned that allowing the community to \"add<br />\ningredients to the cake rather than give them<br />\nthe finished product to swallow\" expedites<br />\nmatters immensely. Hopefully the hospital<br />\ncan atone for the heritage of racism which has<br />\ndampened its relationship with the<br />\nsurrounding community and between its own<br />\nmembers. I believe its recent efforts to do this<br />\nare a commendable start in that direction.<br /><br />\nNEWS\u2014LETTER<br /><br />\nMarch 12, 1971<br /><br />\nPAGE 7<br /><br />\nInside the N-L<br /><br />\nWh,o Wants Yesterday's Papers?<br />\ntime to think up angles and<br />\nanalyses between the Sunday<br />\nand<br />\narid Wednesday all-night<br />\nTED ROHRLICH<br />\n,<br />\nringers.<br />\nMass media, by definition,,.

(You're laughing, but it's possible.) It is, however,<br />\na very slim chance and it will require you to do something you've<br />\nnever done before: take notes.<br />\n\\V by haven't you been taking notes? I'll tell you why. Let's suppose you're at a history lecture. Let's suppose the topic is the ruling<br />\nhouses of England. You start out tine. You put down the lecturer's<br />\npoints one after another with Roman numerals just like you're supposed to. Like this:<br />\nI. house of Plantagenet<br />\nII. House of Lancaster<br />\nIII. House of York<br />\nThen suddenly you stop. You put down your pen. You blink back<br />\na tear. You can't go on. Oh sure, you know the next ruling house is the<br />\n!louse of Tudor. What. you don't know is the Roman numeral that<br />\ncomes after ill<br />\nThere's t he !langur). those middy Roman numerals! flow come<br />\nwe keep using them when even the Romans didn't know how? Oh, I<br />\nguess they could tell you how much V or X were or like that, but when<br />\nit came to skullcrackers like 1,X I or M MC, they just Hang away their<br />\nstyluses and went downtown to have a bath or take in a circus or maybe stab Caesar a few times.<br />\nYou may wonder why Rome stuck with these ridiculous numerals<br />\nwhen the Arabs had such a nice simple system. Well sir, the fact is that<br />\nEmperor Vespasian tried like crazy to buy the Arabic numerals from<br />\nthe Sultan, Sulieman the I I airy, but Sulieman wouldn't do business-not even when Vespasian raised his bid to 100,000 gold piasters, plus<br />\nhe offered to throw in the<br />\nthe Appian Way and Chad t on<br />\nI lesion.<br />\nC1111)sseu in,<br /><br />\nW..Air AP \u20224...

One day in the Forum, Cicero and Pliny the Elder got to arguing about how much is CD14 times M VI X. Well sir, pretty soon everybody in town came around to join the hassle.

Let's also say a word -about Miller High Life<br />\nBeer because the brewers of Miller High Life Beer sponsor this column<br />\nand they're inclined to sulk if I don't mention their product. Naturally, they don't sulk long, the brewers of Miller High Life Beer, for<br />\nthey are ebullient, great-spirited men, as chock-full of sunniness as the<br />\nbeer they brew. Believe me, I know. Every Tuesday I have lunch with<br />\nthem at the brewery and I've never seen such a fun place!<br />\nThe lunches always get off to a rousing start with everybody singing the Miller Pep Song which you all know, of course:<br />\nI'm a keg of Miller\u2014<br />\nI'm a keg of Miller \u2014<br />\n1 will please your palate.<br />\nSo go and get a mallet.<br />\nI'm a key of Miller\u2014<br />\nI'm a keg of Miller\u2014<br />\nI will make you feel young.<br />\nAnd bang away at my bung.<br />\nWell sir, this is only the beginning. Next, everyone gets'up in turn<br />\nand does a hilarious bit. For instance, Frank Glebe from Hops Control<br />\nimitates a chicken; Rex Gransmire from Label Gumming touches his<br />\near with his tongue; Charley Froos from Malt Flow cracks a walnut<br />\nin his armpit; Norman Berswang from Fermentation touches his armpit with his tongue; a:; you ace, just one belly-buster after another.<br />\nBut lunch ends with a tranquil and rather solemn moment. Ed<br />\nGonder, the brewery chaplain, closes the proceedings with an invocation to St. Dintenfass, the patron saint of carbon dioxide, and then<br />\nthey all return to their work renewed\u2022and inspired, just as you too will<br />\nbe after you too have enjoyed the joys of Miller High Life.

The<br />\nsound system emitted odd<br />\nnoises of test tones and<br />\nseveral Don Dumphy (the<br />\nHoward Cosell of the boxing<br /><br />\nHappiness Is<br />\nA Warm Gun<br />\n(continued from previous page)<br />\nadvice and instructions on the<br />\nsafe and proper handling of<br />\nfirearms.<br />\nMajor Lee, who, while in<br />\nGermany, dominated the<br />\nThird Armor (\"Spearhead\")<br />\nDivision's rifle team for two<br />\n.Years, says that the rifle<br />\nrange (which is housed in the<br />\nbasement of the ROTC<br />\nbuilding) is not strictly for<br />\nROTC practice and rifle<br />\nmatches; all JHU students,<br />\nfaculty members and their<br />\ndependents are authorized to<br />\nuse these facilities.<br />\nRifles, ammunition, live<br />\ntargets and instruction will be<br />\nprovided free of charge by the<br />\nROTC cadre. All you have to<br />\nProvide is your body. (If you<br />\nWish to bring your own rifle,<br />\nfeel free to do so; however,<br />\nOnly .22 caliber rifles are<br />\nauthorized for firing on the<br />\nrange.)<br />\nSo, if you would like to shoot<br />\nfor recreation, survival or the<br />\nHopkins Varsity Rifle Team,<br />\nSpeak with any of the<br />\ngentlemen in the ROTC<br />\nbuilding; they'll be glad to<br />\nhelp you out.<br /><br />\nworld) test phrases.<br />\nBy 10:10 the crowd was<br />\nbusy drinking beer and<br />\nimpressing dates with boxing<br />\nknowledge.\"Muhammed. my<br />\nman.\" The lights dimmed<br />\nand a movie called \"The<br />\nFighters\" narrated by Burt<br />\n(Mr. Left Jab) Lancaster lit<br />\nup the screen.

The air in<br />\nthe armory was tense.<br />\n20 X 20<br /><br />\nThe voice of Dumphy broke<br />\nthrough the din, greeting<br />\neveryone to the world capital<br />\nof boxing, Madison Square<br />\nGarden. The first picture<br />\ntransmitted was a twenty-bytwenty close up of the<br />\nspeaker. The omnipresent<br />\ncamera darted into the two<br />\nwhere<br />\nrooms<br />\ndressing<br />\nLancaster and Archie Moore<br />\nchatted briefly with the<br />\ncombatants.<br />\nMuhammed, decked out in<br />\nbright red trunks (color<br />\nkeyed perfectly for the<br />\ntelevision) explained the<br />\nmotives governing the next<br />\nhour of his life.

Next door Joe<br />\ngroaned at Archie Moore,<br />\nwho cleverly groaned back.<br />\nJohnny Addie, the ring<br />\nannouncer, appeared more<br />\nnervous than either fighter as<br />\nhe read the names of the<br />\nofficials and introduced the<br />\nprincipals.

There is no doubt<br />\nabout what happened in that<br />\nhour and ten minutes. Several<br />\nobservations are important<br />\nconcerning the battle itself:<br />\nBoth men have fought far<br />\nmore impressive fights. Ali<br />\nwas wild, frustrated and far<br /><br />\ntoo ostentatious for his own<br />\ngood. His jab, though<br />\npowerful, was frequently<br />\ninaccurrate. Frazier was,<br />\nand always has been, a dirty<br />\nboxer, but he has a very<br />\neffective set of weapons.<br />\nAli was not in the shape he<br />\nclaimed to be in - he was<br />\nsluggish, more like a turtle<br />\nthan a butterfly. Frazier had<br />\ncommand over most of the<br />\nfight because he was tough, in<br />\nbetter<br />\nphysical<br />\nshape,<br />\nrelentless and thoroughly<br />\npsyched.<br />\nEssentially Even<br /><br />\nThe match was essentially<br />\neven.
