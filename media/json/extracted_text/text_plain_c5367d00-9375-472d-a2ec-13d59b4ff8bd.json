CONSIDINE<br />\nIt is truly amazing how much<br />\nground jazz has covered in the<br />\nipast fifty years. One generally<br />\nthinks of Bop as ancient history,<br />\nso it comes as a shock to realize<br />\nthat, were he still alive, Charlie<br />\nI arker would be a mere 56 years<br />\nold. Miles Davis turns fifty next<br />\nyear. And this Thursday, John<br />\nColtrane would have been fifty<br />\nyears old.<br />\nTo attempt to catalogue the<br />\nachievements and influence of<br />\nJohn Coltrane would be an<br />\nexcercise in redundancy. There<br />\nare few saxophonists today who<br />\nhave not been influenced, to<br />\nsome extent, by him; some, like<br />\nWayne Shorter and Archie<br />\nShepp, have absorbed his ideas<br />\ninto their own personal<br />\nvocabularies; others, like Pat<br />\nLaBarbara, sound embarrassingly<br />\nderivative.<br />\nAs an innovator, he was,<br />\nlooked upon as \"the last word\";<br />\nas a social figure, he was classed<br />\nby Black Nationalists with<br />\nMalcom X. And yet, I would<br />\nguess that well over half of the<br />\npeople who see this article have<br />\nnever heard of John Coltrane,<br />\nand of those who have, many are<br />\nonly glancingly familiar with his<br />\nworks.<br />\nThis is not an unusual<br />\nphenomenon, it is merely an<br />\nunfortunate one. Ornette<br />\nColeman once mentioned that<br />\nthe only Coltrane he ever heard<br />\non the radio was My Favorite<br />\nThings, a situation comparable to<br />\nrestricting the airplay of<br />\nBeethoven's works to Symphony<br />\nNo. Three. Because he has been<br />\ndead since 1967, the press pretty<br />\nmuch ignores him, and he has no<br />\nchance of appearing on<br />\ntelevision. Unlike Charlie Parker,<br />\nhe lacks a colorful nickname, and<br />\nthe brooding, self-absorbed<br />\nnature of much or rus recorded<br />\nwork forced his ouvre further<br />\ninto obscurity.<br />\nThus, it is the purpose of this<br />\narticle to acquaint the novice<br />\nwith the recorded works of John<br />\nColtrane, as well as to attempt a<br />\ndefinition of his stylistic and<br />\nhistorical circumstances.

Bostic was an<br />\nR&B king at the time,<br />\ncomparable to Junior Walker or<br />\nRonnie Laws today. Coltrane<br />\ngrew up with R&B, so it was not<br />\nunusual for him to take a job like<br />\nthat. In fact Coltrane had<br />\nnothing but praise for Bostic,<br />\nwhom he said taught him alot<br />\n_about_ the instrument.<br />\nFollowing a stint with his first<br />\nidol, Johnny Hodges,(1953-54),<br />\nColtrane was hired by the then<br />\nprominent Miles Davis. Miles was<br />\nin the process of switching from<br />\nPrestige to a lucrative contract<br />\nwith Columbia, and Coltrane got<br />\nhis first big break courtesy of a<br />\nbrilliant solo on the tune Round<br />\nMidnight (Columbia 8649). The<br />\ntitle track was one of Davis'<br />\nbiggest successes (it is still<br />\navailable as a single), and this was<br />\nthe start of the big time for<br />\nColtrane.<br />\nBut there were problems.<br />\nColtrane was a popular session<br />\nman, and recorded often; partly<br />\nby demand, partly to support his<br />\nheroin addiction. Along with his<br />\nhabit, Coltrane was becoming<br />\nmore and more exploratory in his<br />\nsoloing, to the point that Miles<br />\nwas sometimes questioned about<br />\nthe logic in choosing Coltrane.<br />\nLike an employee who takes<br />\ntime off to study his work,<br />\nColtrane left Davis in 1957 to<br />\nplay. with Thelonius Monk. This<br />\nwas one of the most important<br />\npoints in Coltrane's career.<br />\nThelonius Monk is creditted with<br />\nbringing dissonence into jazz; i.e.,<br />\nevolving a jazz style where the<br />\nimprovisations were forced into<br />\nunusual harmonic contexts.<br />\nTrane claimed that Monk<br />\nshowed him how to get two and<br />\nthree notes from his horn at one<br />\ntime. \"Monk just looked at my<br />\nhorn,\" he recalled,\"and 'felt' the<br />\nmechanics of it.\" In addition to<br />\nthis technical innovation, Monk<br />\nalso gave Coltrane a greater<br />\nfreedom to play what he wanted.<br />\nAs related by German jazz critic<br />\nJoachim Berendt, the two of<br />\nthem would start out on the<br />\nsame course through the head, go<br />\ntheir separate (but related) ways<br />\nthrough the solo and meet at the<br />\n<br />\nthrough complete progressions in<br />\n<br />\ndirection in iazz.

From My Favorite Things<br />\non, this becomes increasingly<br />\napparent, as the amount of<br />\nenergy exerted by the Coltrane<br />\ngroups increased.<br />\nColtrane was, above all, an<br />\nintense, energetic visionary, who<br />\nused his dissatisfaction with his<br />\npersonal ideas, coupled with his<br />\nintense religiousity to create<br />\nmusic of staggering power. When<br />\nplaying \"uptempo\" numbers, the<br />\nforce could become intense to<br />\nthe point of being unbearable.<br />\nWhen playing ballads, the energy<br />\nis extended, and crystallized into<br />\na smoother melodic idea rather<br />\nthan the jagged, pulsing lines of<br />\nthe rest of his material.<br />\nA good example would be a<br />\ncomparison of A Love Supreme<br />\n(Impulse 77), and Ascension<br />\n(Impulse 95).

The<br />\nfirst time I'd heard Bird play, it<br />\nhit me right between the eyes.<br />\nBefore I switched from alto in<br />\nthat year, it had been strictly a<br />\nBird thing with me, but when I<br />\nbought a tenor to go with Eddie<br />\nVinson's band, a wider area of<br />\nlistening opened up for me.\"<br />\nColtrane stayed with R&B<br />\naltoist Vinson through 1948,<br />\nwhen he gigged around New<br />\nYork until joining the Dizzy<br />\nGillespie Orchestra in 1949.<br />\nTrane played alto with the band<br />\nuntil it dissolved; later, he played<br />\nsmaller combo dates with<br />\nGillespie on alto and tenor. An<br />\nearly solo by Trane ,with this<br />\ngroup can be found on Birk's<br />\nWorks, from the album Dee Gee<br />\nDays (with Gillespie as leader;<br />\nSavoy 2209). Also during this<br />\nperiod, Trane gigged a few times<br />\nwith Miles Davis, a young<br />\ntrumpeter who was known at.<br />\nthat time through his association<br />\nwith Charlie Parker.<br />\nAfter staying with Gillespie<br />\n<br />\nwith Tadd Dameron called<br />\nMating Call, Prestige 7745). One<br />\nrecording, called Monk's Music,<br />\nfeatured a large group with<br />\nveteran tenorman, Coleman<br />\nHawkins, Bop drummer Art<br />\nBlakey, and altoist Gigi Gryce,<br />\namong others. Despite Riverside's<br />\nuntimely demise, these<br />\nrecordings, as well as some<br />\nquartet dates with Trane, Monk,<br />\nBlakey and bassist Wilbur Ware<br />\nhave been re-issued by Milestone<br />\n(Monk/Trane, Milestone 47011).<br />\n<br />\nlater become very important, as<br />\nTrane shows himself to be a<br />\nmelodicist of the highest order.<br />\nThe Miles Davis session<br />\nresulted in the album Kind of<br />\nBlue (Columbia 8163), and<br />\nfeatured Julian \"Cannonball\"<br />\nAdderly, Bill Evans, Paul<br />\nChambers, and Jimmy Cobb<br />\n(with Wyn Kelly on Freddie<br />\nFreeloader instead of Evans). The<br />\nyear was 1959. But by the time<br />\nthe album had been released,<br />\nsomething else happened.<br />\n<br />\nthis time, Coltrane had left Miles<br />\nfor good, and gotten his own<br />\nrecording contract with Atlantic<br />\nrecords.<br />\nHaving absorped the musical<br />\nideas of Miles and Monk, and<br />\nlearning the concepts of Ornette,<br />\nColtrane was finally becoming a<br />\nleader in his own right. But<br />\naccording to tenor saxophonist<br />\nJohn Gilmore, there was still one<br />\nfinal lesson that was learned: Sun<br />\nRa.<br />\nGilmore claims that after<br />\nleaving Miles the first time, Trane<br />\nwas in Chicago where he picked<br />\nup on some of Sun Ra's records<br />\nand pamphlets. Sun Ra's vaguely<br />\npantheistic mysticism, says<br />\nGilmore is what helped Trane<br />\nkick his habit and (with the<br />\nassistance of Sun Ra's music)<br />\nbegan to defige his style.<br />\nSo, by .1960 we have the<br />\nessential elements of Coltrane's<br />\nstyle; a need to search and<br />\nexamine the elements of<br />\nimprovisation; a method that is<br />\nneither modal nor scalar, but<br />\nincorporates elements of both;<br />\nand an aura of devout<br />\nreligiousity. He was by this time<br />\nan accomplished tenorist, and<br />\nhad found two sidemen suitable<br />\nfor his playing: Pianist McCoy<br />\nTyner, and drummer Elvin Jones.<br />\nThe only thing to be added<br />\nwas the soprano sax, an<br />\ninstrument generally in disuse<br />\nsince Sidney Bechet. The choice<br />\nof the instrument was essentially<br />\nby chance; a possibly apocryphal<br />\nstory has it that Coltrane was<br />\ndriving from Washington to New<br />\nYork with three other musicians,<br />\nwhen they made a rest stop in<br />\nBaltimore. Once on their way<br />\nagain, it was noticed that one of<br />\nthem was missing. The others<br />\nhoped he had train fare, and<br />\ncontinued. When finally in New<br />\nYork, Coltrane noticed that the<br />\nman had left an oblong case in<br />\nthe car. Taking it back to his<br />\napartment, Trane discovered a<br />\nsoprano sax inside. The rest, as<br />\nthey say, is history.<br />\nOn a purely musical basis,<br />\nColtrane's adoption of the<br />\ninstrument was a radical<br />\ninnovation in as much as his<br />\nuse of a metal mouthpiece (as<br />\n<br />\nColtrane special 8-midnight Thursday on WCVT-FM 89.7<br />\n<br />\nIn 1958, Coltrane rejoined the<br />\nDavis group. Possibly because of<br />\nnecessarily scalar attitude<br />\nColtrane was forced into by<br />\nMonk's curiously chromatic<br />\ncompositions, possibly because<br />\nof Miles' determination to solve<br />\nthe \"problem\" of chord changes,<br />\npossibly because of George<br />\nRussell's experiments in<br />\nmodality, Miles Davis led a<br />\nrecording session which restricted<br />\nthe improvisation of the solosits<br />\nstrictly to a particular mode, or<br />\nscalar pattern, central to the<br />\ncomposition.<br />\nUp until this time,<br />\nimprovisation had been mainly<br />\nchordal, consisting of lengthy,<br />\narpeggiated developments of the<br />\nchord structure of the tune being<br />\nplayed. yhis was essentially based<br />\non the Bop revolution of Charlie<br />\nParker. Coltrane had taken to<br />\nchordal rambling, playing<br />\n<br />\nThat \"something else\" was<br />\nOrnette Coleman, a quiet,<br />\nindividualistic young altoist from<br />\nFort Worth, Texas. Ornette did<br />\nnot really want to change jazz, he<br />\njust wanted to play. But because<br />\nof the way he played, within'<br />\nmonths of his debut at the Lenox<br />\nMass. Jazz School in 1959, he<br />\nhad created the greatest<br />\ncontroversy in jazz since the<br />\nemergence of Charlie Parker.<br />\nUnlike Parker, who relied on<br />\nchords for, his improvisational<br />\nideas, or Miles who was using<br />\nmodes, Ornette used nothing. No<br />\nchords, no modes, just a melody.<br />\n\"I never know how something<br />\nwill sound until I play it,\" was<br />\nhis explanation. Despite the<br />\nreactionaries who denounced him<br />\nas a charlatan who couldn't find<br />\nhis ways around his instrument<br />\nwithout a tourguide, Ornette<br />\nopened up an entirely new<br />\n<br />\nopposed to. the traditional<br />\nrubber) gave the instrument a<br />\n<br />\n- \u2022 p e, .e an. ogy o wor.<br />\nassociation. In free-jazz, a D is<br />\nrelated to a G by the interval that<br />\n<br />\nseparates them, but also by the<br />\nimplied tonal relationship normal<br />\nmusic would involve. Hence, D to<br />\nG would stand on its own, and<br />\nalso within a system, much like<br />\nanswering \"bell\" to the word<br />\n\"door.\"<br />\nWhat differs, then, is the<br />\ntexture of the piece, the texture<br />\nof the improvisations. Energy<br />\nwas exerted to say something in<br />\nitself, not merely to ipropel. the<br />\nnote.

This kind of victory<br />\nserves as a great mental boost.\"<br />\nHaverford was never out of the<br />\n<br />\nballgame. In fact, the opponents<br />\nout shot the Blue Jays during the<br />\ngame and if it hadn't been for the<br />\nsuperb play of goalie Seusse,<br />\nHaverford would have had more<br />\nthan one tally on the board.<br />\nThe Jays opened the scoring<br />\nmidway through the first half.<br />\nLeft winger Larry McGowan was<br />\nfed a pinpoint through pass by<br />\nTom Myrick and, from ten yards<br />\nout, sent a blistering shot<br />\nbetween the legs of the<br />\nHaverford goal tender.<br />\nThe fast- paced action<br />\ncontinued in the first half as the<br />\nHaverford squad sent a flurry of<br />\nshots on Kenny Seusse. In one<br />\nsequence, a Haverford player's<br />\nshot was blocked by Seusse, but<br />\nthe rebound squirted loose<br />\noffering the opponent a second<br />\nopportunity The rebound shot,<br />\n<br />\nthough, hit the crossbar of the<br />\nnet and Ken was able to dive on<br />\nthe ball, thus stopping play.<br />\nJHU controlled the first part<br />\nof the second half, during which<br />\ncenter forward Greg Cunningham<br />\nscored the second goal.<br />\nSubstitute winger Hasan<br />\nBabaturk crossed the ball to<br />\nCunningham who moved in for<br />\nthe score.<br />\nWith ten minutes remaining in<br />\nthe game, Haverford began to<br />\nmount pressure on the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense. This led to their only<br />\ngoal of the game, a goalpost<br />\nrebound shot.<br />\nHaverford was almost able to<br />\ntie the score when goalie Seusse<br />\n'was caught off guard as he<br />\ndribbled the ball out of the goal<br />\narea. A Haverford player was able<br />\nto take the ball from the Jay<br />\n<br />\ngoalie, but instead of shooting<br />\nthe ball he tried to feed a pass to<br />\none of his teammates. Seusse<br />\nrecovered nicely and intercepted<br />\nthe errant attempt.<br />\nThis victory was important for<br />\nthe JHU squad since it was one<br />\nof the five league games they<br />\nplay in their thirteen game<br />\nschedule. These league games<br />\ndecide which of the six teams<br />\ncompeting will become<br />\nchampions of the Southern<br />\nDivision of the Middle fAtlantic<br />\nConference. Since Haverford<br />\ncame in second to the Blue Jays<br />\nlast year in the Southern<br />\nDivision, it was also especially<br />\nimportant that JHU come out on<br />\ntop in this contest.<br />\nThe Jays are scheduled next to<br />\nmeet the University of Maryland,<br />\n<br />\nBaltimore County on Saturday.<br />\nTheir first home game will be<br />\nplayed under the lights at<br />\nHomewood field against<br />\nDelaware on Wednesday,<br />\nSeptember 29.<br />\n\"We are now starting to play<br />\nas a team,\" cited Tom Myrick.\"I<br />\nfeel very confident that we will<br />\nbe improving as we go on.\" And<br />\nif that is so, another<br />\nchampionship can be expected to<br />\narrive at Johns Hopkins this fall.<br />\n<br />\nWomen's tennis team<br />\ntvins initial contest<br />\nIf you've seen Dr. Joyce<br />\nHogan smiling recently, it could<br />\nbe<br />\nbecause she's thinking of<br />\nher women's tennis team.<br />\nLast year's squad finished with<br />\na record of 7-3\u2014good enough for<br />\nthird place in the AC\u2014and only<br />\nthree of nine starters from that<br />\nteam will not be returning to the<br />\ncourts this year.<br />\n\"My expectation is that we<br />\nshould do very well,\" Dr.!Hogan<br />\nsaid recently. \"We should be a<br />\ntop contender in the MAC and<br />\nI'd be disappointed if we didn't<br />\nWin the championship.\"<br />\n\"Women's dual tennis<br />\ncompetition -is normally divided<br />\ninto a total of seven<br />\nmatches\u2014five !singles and two<br />\ndoubles competitions.

CONSIDINE<br />\nIt is truly amazing how much<br />\nground jazz has covered in the<br />\nipast fifty years. One generally<br />\nthinks of Bop as ancient history,<br />\nso it comes as a shock to realize<br />\nthat, were he still alive, Charlie<br />\nI arker would be a mere 56 years<br />\nold. Miles Davis turns fifty next<br />\nyear. And this Thursday, John<br />\nColtrane would have been fifty<br />\nyears old.<br />\nTo attempt to catalogue the<br />\nachievements and influence of<br />\nJohn Coltrane would be an<br />\nexcercise in redundancy. There<br />\nare few saxophonists today who<br />\nhave not been influenced, to<br />\nsome extent, by him; some, like<br />\nWayne Shorter and Archie<br />\nShepp, have absorbed his ideas<br />\ninto their own personal<br />\nvocabularies; others, like Pat<br />\nLaBarbara, sound embarrassingly<br />\nderivative.<br />\nAs an innovator, he was,<br />\nlooked upon as \"the last word\";<br />\nas a social figure, he was classed<br />\nby Black Nationalists with<br />\nMalcom X. And yet, I would<br />\nguess that well over half of the<br />\npeople who see this article have<br />\nnever heard of John Coltrane,<br />\nand of those who have, many are<br />\nonly glancingly familiar with his<br />\nworks.<br />\nThis is not an unusual<br />\nphenomenon, it is merely an<br />\nunfortunate one. Ornette<br />\nColeman once mentioned that<br />\nthe only Coltrane he ever heard<br />\non the radio was My Favorite<br />\nThings, a situation comparable to<br />\nrestricting the airplay of<br />\nBeethoven's works to Symphony<br />\nNo. Three. Because he has been<br />\ndead since 1967, the press pretty<br />\nmuch ignores him, and he has no<br />\nchance of appearing on<br />\ntelevision. Unlike Charlie Parker,<br />\nhe lacks a colorful nickname, and<br />\nthe brooding, self-absorbed<br />\nnature of much or rus recorded<br />\nwork forced his ouvre further<br />\ninto obscurity.<br />\nThus, it is the purpose of this<br />\narticle to acquaint the novice<br />\nwith the recorded works of John<br />\nColtrane, as well as to attempt a<br />\ndefinition of his stylistic and<br />\nhistorical circumstances. As a<br />\nreference aid, the catalogue<br />\nril\u2018rinhai-c.csf<br /><br />\nlt<br /><br />\nrPfstArfliT1CIC<br /><br />\nthrough 1951, Trane worked<br />\nwith the immensely popular<br />\naltoist Earl Bostic. Bostic was an<br />\nR&amp;B king at the time,<br />\ncomparable to Junior Walker or<br />\nRonnie Laws today. Coltrane<br />\ngrew up with R&amp;B, so it was not<br />\nunusual for him to take a job like<br />\nthat. In fact Coltrane had<br />\nnothing but praise for Bostic,<br />\nwhom he said taught him alot<br />\n_about_ the instrument.<br />\nFollowing a stint with his first<br />\nidol, Johnny Hodges,(1953-54),<br />\nColtrane was hired by the then<br />\nprominent Miles Davis. Miles was<br />\nin the process of switching from<br />\nPrestige to a lucrative contract<br />\nwith Columbia, and Coltrane got<br />\nhis first big break courtesy of a<br />\nbrilliant solo on the tune Round<br />\nMidnight (Columbia 8649). The<br />\ntitle track was one of Davis'<br />\nbiggest successes (it is still<br />\navailable as a single), and this was<br />\nthe start of the big time for<br />\nColtrane.<br />\nBut there were problems.<br />\nColtrane was a popular session<br />\nman, and recorded often; partly<br />\nby demand, partly to support his<br />\nheroin addiction. Along with his<br />\nhabit, Coltrane was becoming<br />\nmore and more exploratory in his<br />\nsoloing, to the point that Miles<br />\nwas sometimes questioned about<br />\nthe logic in choosing Coltrane.<br />\nLike an employee who takes<br />\ntime off to study his work,<br />\nColtrane left Davis in 1957 to<br />\nplay. with Thelonius Monk. This<br />\nwas one of the most important<br />\npoints in Coltrane's career.<br />\nThelonius Monk is creditted with<br />\nbringing dissonence into jazz; i.e.,<br />\nevolving a jazz style where the<br />\nimprovisations were forced into<br />\nunusual harmonic contexts.<br />\nTrane claimed that Monk<br />\nshowed him how to get two and<br />\nthree notes from his horn at one<br />\ntime. \"Monk just looked at my<br />\nhorn,\" he recalled,\"and 'felt' the<br />\nmechanics of it.\" In addition to<br />\nthis technical innovation, Monk<br />\nalso gave Coltrane a greater<br />\nfreedom to play what he wanted.<br />\nAs related by German jazz critic<br />\nJoachim Berendt, the two of<br />\nthem would start out on the<br />\nsame course through the head, go<br />\ntheir separate (but related) ways<br />\nthrough the solo and meet at the<br /><br />\nthrough complete progressions in<br /><br />\ndirection in iazz.

Rogers &amp;<br />\nHammerstein's well-known waltz<br />\nwas stretched and altered into a<br />\nsinging, swinging jazz classic.<br />\nTyner's niodal alteration of the<br />\nchord structures and Jones'<br />\npolyrythmic, stuttered waltzing<br />\ncombined with Coltrane's<br />\nmusettish soprano to create what<br />\nwas Coltrane's most populg<br />\nsession as a leader.

From My Favorite Things<br />\non, this becomes increasingly<br />\napparent, as the amount of<br />\nenergy exerted by the Coltrane<br />\ngroups increased.<br />\nColtrane was, above all, an<br />\nintense, energetic visionary, who<br />\nused his dissatisfaction with his<br />\npersonal ideas, coupled with his<br />\nintense religiousity to create<br />\nmusic of staggering power. When<br />\nplaying \"uptempo\" numbers, the<br />\nforce could become intense to<br />\nthe point of being unbearable.<br />\nWhen playing ballads, the energy<br />\nis extended, and crystallized into<br />\na smoother melodic idea rather<br />\nthan the jagged, pulsing lines of<br />\nthe rest of his material.<br />\nA good example would be a<br />\ncomparison of A Love Supreme<br />\n(Impulse 77), and Ascension<br />\n(Impulse 95). Recorded and<br />\nreleased within a year of each<br />\nother, Love Supreme is a<br />\nmeditative, reflective work, while<br />\nAscension is a forty-minute<br />\nexercise in pure, ferocious<br />\nenergy.<br />\nAs far as the theory involved<br />\ngoes, they are quite similar. Love<br />\nSupreme is basically exercises on<br />\na pedal point, wherein the basic<br />\nideas of tonality are stretched to<br />\ntheir ultimate possible<br />\nconclusions. Ascension, on the<br />\nother hand, is an all-out avant<br />\ngardist date, with no tonal axis.<br />\nBut, as Ornette Coleman's music<br />\n.<br />\nhad shown, the<br />\n- tonality is<br />\n- still<br /><br />\nseptember 21, 1976/news-letter/page la<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\nThe Baltimore Free University is a non-profit, non-partisan volunteer organization<br />\nWhich seeks to provide an open educational forum for the exchange of skills, information,<br />\nand ideas within a flexible non-graded structure.

It was 1943, and the<br />\nRabbit was the man on the alto<br />\nscene, especially through his<br />\nassociation with Duke Ellington.<br />\nHe later went to the Ornstein<br />\nSchool of Music in Philadelphia,<br />\nand made his \"professional<br />\ndebut\" in 1945.<br />\n' One of the musicians Coltrane<br />\nmet while in Philly was Cal<br />\nMassey, a trumpet player and<br />\ncomposer who has gone almost<br />\ntotally ignored, despite the depth<br />\nof his talent (for a better<br />\nperspective on Masssy, consult<br />\nthe Archie Shepp recordings<br />\nAttica Blues, Impulse 9222, The<br />\nCry of My People, Impulse 9231,<br />\nand Kwanza, Impulse 9262).<br />\nAtter a brief stint with the Navy<br />\nband in Hawaii (1945-46),<br />\nColtrane returned to the East<br />\nCoast.<br />\nTo quote Coltrane: \"I stayed<br />\nwith alto through 1947, and by<br />\nthen I'd come under the<br />\ninfluence of Charlie Parker. The<br />\nfirst time I'd heard Bird play, it<br />\nhit me right between the eyes.<br />\nBefore I switched from alto in<br />\nthat year, it had been strictly a<br />\nBird thing with me, but when I<br />\nbought a tenor to go with Eddie<br />\nVinson's band, a wider area of<br />\nlistening opened up for me.\"<br />\nColtrane stayed with R&amp;B<br />\naltoist Vinson through 1948,<br />\nwhen he gigged around New<br />\nYork until joining the Dizzy<br />\nGillespie Orchestra in 1949.<br />\nTrane played alto with the band<br />\nuntil it dissolved; later, he played<br />\nsmaller combo dates with<br />\nGillespie on alto and tenor. An<br />\nearly solo by Trane ,with this<br />\ngroup can be found on Birk's<br />\nWorks, from the album Dee Gee<br />\nDays (with Gillespie as leader;<br />\nSavoy 2209). Also during this<br />\nperiod, Trane gigged a few times<br />\nwith Miles Davis, a young<br />\ntrumpeter who was known at.<br />\nthat time through his association<br />\nwith Charlie Parker.<br />\nAfter staying with Gillespie<br /><br />\nwith Tadd Dameron called<br />\nMating Call, Prestige 7745). One<br />\nrecording, called Monk's Music,<br />\nfeatured a large group with<br />\nveteran tenorman, Coleman<br />\nHawkins, Bop drummer Art<br />\nBlakey, and altoist Gigi Gryce,<br />\namong others. Despite Riverside's<br />\nuntimely demise, these<br />\nrecordings, as well as some<br />\nquartet dates with Trane, Monk,<br />\nBlakey and bassist Wilbur Ware<br />\nhave been re-issued by Milestone<br />\n(Monk/Trane, Milestone 47011).<br /><br />\nlater become very important, as<br />\nTrane shows himself to be a<br />\nmelodicist of the highest order.<br />\nThe Miles Davis session<br />\nresulted in the album Kind of<br />\nBlue (Columbia 8163), and<br />\nfeatured Julian \"Cannonball\"<br />\nAdderly, Bill Evans, Paul<br />\nChambers, and Jimmy Cobb<br />\n(with Wyn Kelly on Freddie<br />\nFreeloader instead of Evans). The<br />\nyear was 1959. But by the time<br />\nthe album had been released,<br />\nsomething else happened.<br /><br />\nthis time, Coltrane had left Miles<br />\nfor good, and gotten his own<br />\nrecording contract with Atlantic<br />\nrecords.<br />\nHaving absorped the musical<br />\nideas of Miles and Monk, and<br />\nlearning the concepts of Ornette,<br />\nColtrane was finally becoming a<br />\nleader in his own right. But<br />\naccording to tenor saxophonist<br />\nJohn Gilmore, there was still one<br />\nfinal lesson that was learned: Sun<br />\nRa.<br />\nGilmore claims that after<br />\nleaving Miles the first time, Trane<br />\nwas in Chicago where he picked<br />\nup on some of Sun Ra's records<br />\nand pamphlets. Sun Ra's vaguely<br />\npantheistic mysticism, says<br />\nGilmore is what helped Trane<br />\nkick his habit and (with the<br />\nassistance of Sun Ra's music)<br />\nbegan to defige his style.<br />\nSo, by .1960 we have the<br />\nessential elements of Coltrane's<br />\nstyle; a need to search and<br />\nexamine the elements of<br />\nimprovisation; a method that is<br />\nneither modal nor scalar, but<br />\nincorporates elements of both;<br />\nand an aura of devout<br />\nreligiousity. He was by this time<br />\nan accomplished tenorist, and<br />\nhad found two sidemen suitable<br />\nfor his playing: Pianist McCoy<br />\nTyner, and drummer Elvin Jones.<br />\nThe only thing to be added<br />\nwas the soprano sax, an<br />\ninstrument generally in disuse<br />\nsince Sidney Bechet. The choice<br />\nof the instrument was essentially<br />\nby chance; a possibly apocryphal<br />\nstory has it that Coltrane was<br />\ndriving from Washington to New<br />\nYork with three other musicians,<br />\nwhen they made a rest stop in<br />\nBaltimore. Once on their way<br />\nagain, it was noticed that one of<br />\nthem was missing. The others<br />\nhoped he had train fare, and<br />\ncontinued. When finally in New<br />\nYork, Coltrane noticed that the<br />\nman had left an oblong case in<br />\nthe car. Taking it back to his<br />\napartment, Trane discovered a<br />\nsoprano sax inside. The rest, as<br />\nthey say, is history.<br />\nOn a purely musical basis,<br />\nColtrane's adoption of the<br />\ninstrument was a radical<br />\ninnovation in as much as his<br />\nuse of a metal mouthpiece (as<br /><br />\nColtrane special 8-midnight Thursday on WCVT-FM 89.7<br /><br />\nIn 1958, Coltrane rejoined the<br />\nDavis group. Possibly because of<br />\nnecessarily scalar attitude<br />\nColtrane was forced into by<br />\nMonk's curiously chromatic<br />\ncompositions, possibly because<br />\nof Miles' determination to solve<br />\nthe \"problem\" of chord changes,<br />\npossibly because of George<br />\nRussell's experiments in<br />\nmodality, Miles Davis led a<br />\nrecording session which restricted<br />\nthe improvisation of the solosits<br />\nstrictly to a particular mode, or<br />\nscalar pattern, central to the<br />\ncomposition.<br />\nUp until this time,<br />\nimprovisation had been mainly<br />\nchordal, consisting of lengthy,<br />\narpeggiated developments of the<br />\nchord structure of the tune being<br />\nplayed. yhis was essentially based<br />\non the Bop revolution of Charlie<br />\nParker. Coltrane had taken to<br />\nchordal rambling, playing<br /><br />\nThat \"something else\" was<br />\nOrnette Coleman, a quiet,<br />\nindividualistic young altoist from<br />\nFort Worth, Texas. Ornette did<br />\nnot really want to change jazz, he<br />\njust wanted to play. But because<br />\nof the way he played, within'<br />\nmonths of his debut at the Lenox<br />\nMass. Jazz School in 1959, he<br />\nhad created the greatest<br />\ncontroversy in jazz since the<br />\nemergence of Charlie Parker.<br />\nUnlike Parker, who relied on<br />\nchords for, his improvisational<br />\nideas, or Miles who was using<br />\nmodes, Ornette used nothing. No<br />\nchords, no modes, just a melody.<br />\n\"I never know how something<br />\nwill sound until I play it,\" was<br />\nhis explanation. Despite the<br />\nreactionaries who denounced him<br />\nas a charlatan who couldn't find<br />\nhis ways around his instrument<br />\nwithout a tourguide, Ornette<br />\nopened up an entirely new<br /><br />\nopposed to. the traditional<br />\nrubber) gave the instrument a<br /><br />\n- \u2022 p e, .e an. ogy o wor.<br />\nassociation. In free-jazz, a D is<br />\nrelated to a G by the interval that<br /><br />\nseparates them, but also by the<br />\nimplied tonal relationship normal<br />\nmusic would involve. Hence, D to<br />\nG would stand on its own, and<br />\nalso within a system, much like<br />\nanswering \"bell\" to the word<br />\n\"door.\"<br />\nWhat differs, then, is the<br />\ntexture of the piece, the texture<br />\nof the improvisations. Energy<br />\nwas exerted to say something in<br />\nitself, not merely to ipropel. the<br />\nnote. On Meditations (Impulse<br />\n9110), there is the same idea as<br />\nLove Supreme, but an entirely<br />\ndifferent surface to the music.<br />\nThis insistance upon textures of<br />\nforce and intensity would explain<br />\nthe occasional use of two<br />\nbassists, as well as the addition of<br />\ntenorman Pharoah Sanders.<br />\nIt would also explain while<br />\nColtrane dropped McCoy Tyner<br />\nand Elvin Jones after so many<br />\nyears. They were too structured<br />\nin their approach to fit Coltrane's<br />\nideas. Rashied Ali and Alice<br />\nColtrane (Drums and Piano,<br />\nrespectively), were much more<br />\nattuned to this frantic colorism.<br />\nIn the last years of his life,<br />\nColtrane had added African<br />\npercussionists, as well as<br />\nsaxophonist Albert Ayler to his<br />\nband, and waY even<br />\nexperimenting with Electric<br />\nSaxophone.<br />\nBut in 1967, John Coltrane<br />\ndied, of an unexpected heart<br />\nattack. Although sudden, it does<br />\nnot seem odd that a man who<br />\nexpended that much energy<br />\nwould meet such a demise. Even<br />\nup to his death, Coltrane kept on<br />\nsearching, and growing<br />\nreligiously. He was fond of saying<br />\nthat he believed in all religions,<br />\nand was becoming a student of<br />\nHinduism.<br />\nThere has been, as there was<br />\nafter Charlie Parker's death, the<br />\nquestion of \"who will carry on?\"<br />\nIt is an absurd question, for<br />\nwould one expect someone to<br />\ncontinue to paint i'icassos after<br />\nhis demise? People point to<br />\nArchie Shepp, or Roland Kirk, or<br />\nPharoah Sanders, but they are<br />\nonly disciples, not the prophet<br />\nhimself.<br />\nWhat is the answer, then?<br />\nWhere would Coltrane be today?<br />\nIt seems painfully obvious; were<br />\nhe still alive, Coltrane would still<br />\nbe looking.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letter/september 21, 1976<br /><br />\nSears<br /><br />\n3 things that every<br />\ncollege student should know:<br />\nYou can SAVE '5 on this<br />\nle slide-rule<br />\ncalculator<br />\nP9<br /><br />\nSALE 14Regular<br />\n819.99<br /><br />\na.

This kind of victory<br />\nserves as a great mental boost.\"<br />\nHaverford was never out of the<br /><br />\nballgame. In fact, the opponents<br />\nout shot the Blue Jays during the<br />\ngame and if it hadn't been for the<br />\nsuperb play of goalie Seusse,<br />\nHaverford would have had more<br />\nthan one tally on the board.<br />\nThe Jays opened the scoring<br />\nmidway through the first half.<br />\nLeft winger Larry McGowan was<br />\nfed a pinpoint through pass by<br />\nTom Myrick and, from ten yards<br />\nout, sent a blistering shot<br />\nbetween the legs of the<br />\nHaverford goal tender.<br />\nThe fast- paced action<br />\ncontinued in the first half as the<br />\nHaverford squad sent a flurry of<br />\nshots on Kenny Seusse. In one<br />\nsequence, a Haverford player's<br />\nshot was blocked by Seusse, but<br />\nthe rebound squirted loose<br />\noffering the opponent a second<br />\nopportunity The rebound shot,<br /><br />\nthough, hit the crossbar of the<br />\nnet and Ken was able to dive on<br />\nthe ball, thus stopping play.<br />\nJHU controlled the first part<br />\nof the second half, during which<br />\ncenter forward Greg Cunningham<br />\nscored the second goal.<br />\nSubstitute winger Hasan<br />\nBabaturk crossed the ball to<br />\nCunningham who moved in for<br />\nthe score.<br />\nWith ten minutes remaining in<br />\nthe game, Haverford began to<br />\nmount pressure on the Blue Jay<br />\ndefense. This led to their only<br />\ngoal of the game, a goalpost<br />\nrebound shot.<br />\nHaverford was almost able to<br />\ntie the score when goalie Seusse<br />\n'was caught off guard as he<br />\ndribbled the ball out of the goal<br />\narea. A Haverford player was able<br />\nto take the ball from the Jay<br /><br />\ngoalie, but instead of shooting<br />\nthe ball he tried to feed a pass to<br />\none of his teammates. Seusse<br />\nrecovered nicely and intercepted<br />\nthe errant attempt.<br />\nThis victory was important for<br />\nthe JHU squad since it was one<br />\nof the five league games they<br />\nplay in their thirteen game<br />\nschedule. These league games<br />\ndecide which of the six teams<br />\ncompeting will become<br />\nchampions of the Southern<br />\nDivision of the Middle fAtlantic<br />\nConference.
