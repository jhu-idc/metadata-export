But students<br />\nare objecting again because they want to<br />\nstudy far, far away from the sterile surroundings of the MSE Library.<br />\nTwo years. Two suggestions. Two ways<br />\nto get rid of the Hutzler Undergraduate<br />\nLibrary as the undergraduate reading room.<br />\nAnd both times, students have objected, but<br />\nthis time, the problem is more serious. Last<br />\nyear's suggestion was just that\u2014a<br />\nsuggestion\u2014but this year's suggestion has<br />\nturned into a proposal, already submitted to<br />\nPresident Steven Muller and to Provost and<br />\nVice President of Academic Affairs Richard<br />\nLongaker. And that's the problem. The administration, once again, has neglected to<br />\nconsult with the students. They didn't consult With students when they reorganized the<br />\ndean structure nor did they consult with<br />\nstudents when they selected the deans. So<br />\nwhy should this time be any different? The<br />\nadministration is succeeding at being consistent, but unfortunately, reputations result<br />\nfrom consistent actions, and the administration is getting a reputation of not listening<br />\nto students, or better yet, of not seeking<br />\nstudents' opinions.<br />\nIssue after issue, the administration says<br />\nthey want to make improvements which<br />\nwould benefit both students and faculty.<br />\nWell, this time, the improvements would be<br />\nat the expense of a sacred campus<br />\ninstitution\u2014an institution that's been part<br />\nof Hopkins for 20 years.<br />\nTo be sure, the MSE Library needs more<br />\nroom, but converting the Hut into a Special<br />\nCollections Room and converting the Garrett Room into a combination reading<br />\nroom/reserve room is not the solution.<br />\nIt appears that the administration wants<br />\nto make Gilman Hall a showplace with the<br />\nSpecial Collections Room as its centerpiece.<br />\nDuring the summer of 1985, the dean of the<br />\narts and sciences and the dean of engineering are scheduled to move into the east wing<br />\nof Gilman. At the same time, the other<br />\ndeans, along with the political economy, the<br />\npolitical science, and the sociology departments, will move to Mergenthaler Hall'.<br />\nThus, Gilman will house the humanities<br />\ndepartments, the two principle deans, and<br />\neither Hut I or Hut II.<br />\nHut I is a place where students socialize<br />\nand study, both during the day and at night.<br />\nDuring the day, students either sit in the coffee shop area or in the Hut itself. They wait,<br />\nfor upcoming classes. Or they talk. Or they<br />\nread magazines and newspapers. Or they<br />\n<br />\nfinish assignments. Or they just relax. 'They'<br />\neven includes many faculty members who<br />\nalso, not surprisingly, enjoy reading<br />\nperiodicals, flip through reference books,<br />\nand drink tea at the coffee shop which will<br />\nbe moved if Hut I becomes Hut II.<br />\nHut II will be an air-conditioned Special<br />\nCollections Room with rare books occupying one-third of it and carpet and chairs occupying two-thirds of it. Air conditioning is<br />\nthe only reason people would want to stay<br />\nin Hut II. Rare books, because of the acid<br />\nin their pages, tend to deteriorate if they<br />\naren't stored properly. Hut I currently is not<br />\nair-conditioned. Instead, large fans prevent<br />\npeople from deteriorating during hot<br />\nweather.<br />\nHut II will be a place where receptions can<br />\nbe held and where the Trustees can meet.<br />\nThere's no other reason to house rare books<br />\nin a Special Collections Room. Hut II will<br />\nbe a reception area with a showcase to impress people. And that's all.<br />\nSince Hut II will not be open 24 hours and<br />\nsince it will be too fancy(most likely, smoking will not be allowed because of the rare<br />\nbooks), students will have to go to the Garrett Room (most likely, smoking will not be<br />\nallowed because of the small area) which will<br />\nbe a combination reading room/reserve<br />\nroom, open 24 hours. The present reserve<br />\nroom and map room on M level will then<br />\nprovide more space for students to study<br />\nduring the regular library hours, but this additional space won't be available between<br />\nmidnight and eight in the morning. Thus,<br />\nstudents won't be able to take reserve<br />\nmaterial out of the noisy and crowded Garrett Room. Currently, most students read<br />\nreserve material elsewhere. So the library will<br />\nhave to change the reserve policy or install<br />\na few photocopying machines.<br />\nThe Garrett Room's conversion will also<br />\ndecrease the amount of available meeting<br />\nspace on campus, which is already a problem. Using rooms in Levering Hall is a<br />\nnossibility, but so is converting some of those<br />\nrooms into reading rooms.<br />\nYes, more space is needed for books. Yes,<br />\nmore space is needed for students to study.<br />\nYes, rare books are important, and they<br />\nshould be stored in a central location.<br />\nBut other aspects of campus, especially<br />\nthose aspects affecting social life, should also<br />\nbe considered. The Rat. The Student Union.<br />\nThe Glass Pavilion. The Great Hall. And the<br />\nlist goes on. As Dean of Arts and Sciences<br />\nGeorge Fisher said, \"Everything must be<br />\ncondidered as a package.\"<br />\nThe solution is not simple. Students, faculty members, and administrators must sit<br />\ndown and talk about the future. Until that<br />\nhappens, communication will continue to he<br />\nthe main problem on this campus.<br />\nBut for now, the Hutzler Undergraduate<br />\nLibrary must be preserved as the Hut and<br />\nnot as a museum for a Special Books<br />\nCollection.<br />\n<br />\nRatting on the Thieves<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhen I read the article in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter concerning<br />\nthe rats that were stolen from<br />\nAmes Hall, I was mortified. It<br />\nnever ceases to amaze me how<br />\nsome people can be so stupid<br />\nand have such a limited<br />\nmentality.<br />\nI wonder if the members of<br />\nthe Animal Liberation Front<br />\nknow how many of their<br />\nrelatives are alive today thanks<br />\nto the \"pointless and repulsive\"<br />\nexperiments that have been performed on laboratory animals.<br />\nI wonder if they know how<br />\nmany vaccines they themselves<br />\nhave been treated with that<br />\nwere developed and tested in<br />\nlaboratory animals. I do not<br />\nthink that they do.<br />\nIt did my heart good to read<br />\nthe quote from the press release<br />\nissued by the Animal Liberation Front: \"during the<br />\nChristmas season there can be<br />\nno peace on earth as long as we<br />\ncontinue to destroy this planet<br />\nand its inhabitants.\"<br />\nHow then can there be peace<br />\nas long as little children go to<br />\nbed hungry every night and<br />\nwake up to an empty breakfast<br />\ntable every morning of every<br />\nseason of the year? If the efforts of these, \"do-gooders\"<br />\nwere shifted from stealing<br />\nlaboratory rats to stopping pain<br />\nand suffering of human beings<br />\nthroughout the world, then<br />\nmaybe all those children would<br />\nnot have to die of hunger each<br />\nyear and \"peace on earth\"<br />\ncould be achieved.<br />\nWe must remember that the<br />\nneeds of the many outweigh the<br />\nneeds of the few, or better yet,<br />\nthe needs of the human race<br />\noutweigh the needs of the<br />\nanimal race.<br />\nHowever, being an animal<br />\nlover myself, I must be fair and<br />\noffer a suggestion to reduce the<br />\npain and suffering of these<br />\npoor creatures while still saving<br />\nthe lives that medical research<br />\ndoes each year; therefore, I<br />\npropose that we free all<br />\nlaboratory animals and use the<br />\nmembers of the Animal Liberation Front for all these<br />\n\"pointless\" experiments.<br />\nI am sure they would agree<br />\n<br />\nsince they are so committed to<br />\nsaving these animals. Besides, it<br />\nwould save money and show us<br />\nexactly what effect the treatment will have on humans instead of using animals as<br />\nmodels.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJim Pellicane<br />\n<br />\nThe Hut<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThrough various sources, we<br />\nhave been informed that the<br />\ndecision to close the Hutzler<br />\nUndergraduate Library may<br />\nhave already been made by Dr.<br />\nSusan Martin, Director of<br />\nLibrary Services, without<br />\nknowledge of the student body.<br />\nIf this is the case, it would appear that the Student Council's<br />\npresent attempt to deal with the<br />\nissue and to poll for the student<br />\nbody's opinion is a futile effort.<br />\nWe sincerely hope that we have<br />\nbeen misinformed, and that Dr.<br />\nMartin and the Administration<br />\nwill carefully evaluate the situation before making a decision<br />\nwhich will have an immeasurable impact on the<br />\nundergraduate community. We<br />\nfeel that the Administration is<br />\nnot fully aware of the purpose<br />\nwhich the 'Hut' serves or the<br />\nqualities that it possesses which<br />\nmake the 'Hut' indispensable.<br />\nFor this reason, we have included the following:<br />\nI. With regard to the Hut, its<br />\ncentral location makes it an<br />\nideal place for students to go<br />\nbetween classes in order to<br />\nstudy or to, read current<br />\nmagazines and daily papers. Its<br />\nphysical design allows for<br />\nsmoking and non-smoking<br />\nareas and makes the room comfortable for studying as opposed to the MSE Library which<br />\nhas few \"comfortable\" places<br />\nto study and suffers from poor<br />\nlighting and poor ventilation.<br />\nCurrent periodicals are easily<br />\naccessible. It provides a place<br />\nfor group study. It is open 24<br />\nhours a day, seven days a week.<br />\nIt has a non-circulating collection of reference books, which<br />\nis invaluable once the MSE<br />\nLibrary is closed.

With regard to the new 'Hut'<br />\non Q-Level in the east wing of<br />\nthe MSE Library, will it be able<br />\nto accomodate as many people<br />\nas the Hut? Will it be as \"comfortable\" a study facility as the<br />\nHut (i.e., large tables, soft<br />\nchairs, couches? Will it be as<br />\naesthetically appealing as the<br />\nHut? We realize that people<br />\noften fail to comment on this<br />\naspect of the Hut, but quite<br />\nfrankly, we do not think that a<br />\nrare book collection will fully<br />\nappreciate the architecture or<br />\nthe windows)? Will it have a<br />\nnon-circulating reference collection? We feel that the atmosphere created by the Hut,<br />\none which is conducive to studying cannot be recreated at the<br />\nproposed location. Also, what<br />\nwill happen to the Garrett<br />\nRoom? There is already a shortage of rooms in which various<br />\ngroups can meet.<br />\n3. With regard to the space in<br />\nthe renovated dorms and its<br />\npossible role if the Hut is closed, this was intended as new<br />\nspace to be used for social purposes, not to replace rooms used for other purposes. The<br />\ndorm atmosphere is not conducive to studying; it is not a<br />\ncentral location on campus.<br />\nA student affiliation with the<br />\nuniversity does not end once<br />\nclasses are finished for the day.<br />\nMany hours are spent studying,.<br />\nresearching, working on other<br />\nacademic pursuits. It is for thisi<br />\nreason that the Hut plays a<br />\nsignificant role for many<br />\nundergraduates. Dr. Martin<br />\nand the Administration do not<br />\nseem to be aware of this. We<br />\nsuggest that you come visit the<br />\nHut after the MSE Library has<br />\nclosed and observe the activityi<br />\nwhich occurs during the early,<br />\nmorning hours. The night.<br />\nbefore a biochemistry or,<br />\norganic chemistry exam or the<br />\nnight before an engineering<br />\nassignment is due would be<br />\nideal, but any night will do. We<br />\nhave been there al night<br />\n(weekends included) at some<br />\npoint in our three years at<br />\nHopkins and have never been<br />\nwithout company! Also, it<br />\nshould be noted that during the<br />\n<br />\nday, there is plenty of activity<br />\nin the Hut for previously stated<br />\nreasons.<br />\nWith regard to the rare book<br />\ncollection, why not put it in<br />\nHomewood House or some<br />\nother location which has<br />\nalready been removed from student use? We are sure that there<br />\nare many places which could<br />\naccomodate the collection and<br />\nnot have such a significant impact on the students.<br />\nIn closing, we ask students to<br />\nmake use of the Student Council Response Boxes. If you do<br />\nnot, rumor has it (and we hope<br />\nthat it is wrong) that the Hut<br />\nmay be gone before the end of<br />\nthe semester. We also ask Dr.<br />\nMartin and the Administration<br />\nto directly address this issue and<br />\nto justify their intended course<br />\nof action.<br />\nLaurie Hastings<br />\nLisa Nalven<br />\nClass of '85<br />\nP.S. What will happen to the<br />\nGilman Coffee Shop if tne Hut<br />\ncloses?<br />\n<br />\nGuys and Gals<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe News-Letter is so frequently irresponsible that I<br />\nhardly react to it anymore, yet<br />\nthe appearance of \"Feminism<br />\nAbounds I and 11\" demands<br />\nsome response. I understand<br />\nthat it is News-Letter policy to<br />\nprint any letter that drops in its<br />\npath, but I wonder why the<br />\nNews-Letter would print<br />\nsomething as inflammatory, ignorant and schizoid as<br />\n\"Feminism Abounds\" without<br />\nsome editorial comment. This<br />\nindicates to me that the NewsLetter staff is as aware of<br />\nfeminist issues as the author of<br />\n\"Feminism Abounds.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn general, and on this cam'pus in particular, people (I use<br />\nthat word with generosity) have<br />\na grave misunderstanding of<br />\nwho feminists are and what<br />\ntheir goals are. A lot of men<br />\nwould like to disregard<br />\nfeminists as a bunch of women<br />\n(they probably would not use<br />\nthat word) who are easily offended, or more to the point,<br />\nwho just don't get enough. The<br />\ntask of defining feminism in-<br />\n<br />\ntelligently and fairly is a broad,<br />\ncomplex one, but the table is<br />\nnot nearly as important as the<br />\nissues behind it. Feminism is<br />\nnot bra burning\u2014the bras were<br />\nburned in the 60s and 70s. In<br />\nthe 80s, feminism concerns<br />\nitself with how society (and its<br />\ninhabitants) view women at<br />\npresent and historically, how<br />\nwomen view themselves and<br />\nhow the two will affect<br />\nwomen's expectations for<br />\nthemselves. The first step<br />\ntoward abounding feminism is<br />\ndispelling the sort of myth<br />\nabout women perpetuated (and<br />\ncreated) by people like Mr.<br />\nSchizoid from California. I<br />\nleave him anonymous because<br />\nhe is not an individual\u2014he is a<br />\nrepresentative of the warped<br />\nideas that have constrained<br />\nwomen for centuries. Once<br />\nthese myths are disarmed, we<br />\ncan begin to change those structures in society that institutionalize sex bias. Like<br />\nHopkins, for example.<br />\nHopkins admitted women<br />\nover ten years ago and still<br />\nwomen comprise only one third<br />\n(roughly)of the population. In<br />\nfact, the percentage of women<br />\nhas grown very little since the<br />\nearly 70s. All of you neanderthals out there are probably<br />\nsaying<br />\nto<br />\n(satisfiedly)<br />\nyourselves that there just aren't<br />\nenough women smart enough.<br />\nThe number of male and<br />\nfemale applicants is more<br />\nbalanced than the population<br />\nrepresents and I tend to think<br />\nif there were a desire to balance<br />\nthe student body, it could be<br />\ndone without sacrificing<br />\nHopkins' standards. The point<br />\nis that Hopkins is not<br />\ncoeducational\u2014it is a men's<br />\nschool that has conceded to admitting women. A Hopkins<br />\nwoman can never forget (if<br />\nshe's at all aware) that this is a<br />\nmale oriented place. It is blatant in all spheres of Hopkins<br />\nlife. The great majority of professors are white males and the<br />\ncurriculum itself is white male<br />\ndesigned and oriented.<br />\nThere is no better exhibition<br />\nof Hopkins' image of<br />\n\"women\" than the frat scene.<br />\nThe social life revolves around<br />\nan institution that is male<br />\ndominated and degrading to<br />\n<br />\nPACTOUL<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nSuSMITTID FOR TOUR APPUOTAL, MYRON J.

Johnson, are singularly<br />\nresponsible for sexual crimes,<br />\nspousal and child abuse.<br />\nStatistics prove that the majority. of sex crimes or familial<br />\nabuse are perpetrated by men.<br />\nWomen are not responsible for<br />\ndeviant male behavior. A long<br />\nawaited step in a positive direction is the female realization<br />\nthat one need not keep silent or<br />\nremain in abusive situations.<br />\nJohnson's opinions concerning the course of history attempt to vindicate a system of<br />\noppressive domination, and<br />\nconclude with the burden of<br />\nnuclear proliferation and the<br />\nprospect of war placed solely<br />\non the shoulders of women.<br />\nMarion A. Schreiber<br />\n<br />\nFeminism Defined<br />\nTo the Editor...<br />\n<br />\nJoanne Rachel Applebaum<br />\n<br />\nSupporting Evidence<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWayne L. Johnson's masterful diatribe on feminism lacks<br />\nonly a few easily verifiable<br />\nstatistics and data to perfect his<br />\ncogent arguments. As a public<br />\nservice, I should like to reveal<br />\nthese startling facts and figures:<br />\nI. Women have been proven to<br />\nbe associated with 100% of all<br />\ndivorce cases, and can therefore<br />\nbe shown to be at the root of<br />\nAmerica's divorce troubles.<br />\n2. Women have been directly<br />\nimplicated as responsible for<br />\nbringing into this world every<br />\nmurderer, rapist, criminal<br />\nand\u2014God forbid\u2014feminist.<br />\n3. Without women, all war,<br />\ncrime and other female inspired<br />\nevil would vanish in a single<br />\ngeneration.<br />\n4. The feminist rulers of the<br />\nNew<br />\nTestament<br />\nworld<br />\npersecuted<br />\nmankind so<br />\nruthlessly that no historian then<br />\nor since has dared even<br />\nacknowledge the existence of<br />\nmore than a handful of these<br />\ndemons.<br />\n5. The word \"mother\" is a<br />\nswear word in enlightened<br />\ncircles of the American public.<br />\n6. God himself was so .arned<br />\n<br />\nLast weeks' letter entitled<br />\n\"Feminism Abounds 11\" concluded: \"...the suppression of<br />\n(women by men) destroys the<br />\nlove between the two.\". The<br />\nconclusion is illogical, tacked<br />\non as it is to a tirade on the evils<br />\nof feminism. What feminists<br />\nbelieve and what Johnson<br />\nclaims to believe, is that one<br />\nshould \"make love, not<br />\nwar\"\u2014in other words, coexist<br />\npeacefully with others. But the<br />\nmeans feminists choose in order<br />\nto achieve this end are<br />\nsomewhat different from those<br />\nJohnson advocates. Feminists<br />\nbelieve that rather than women<br />\naccepting a subordiante position in society in order to avoid<br />\nconflicts, people should<br />\nrecognize that only equality<br />\nguarantees harmonious social<br />\nrelations.

Both<br />\ntoday's conservatives and<br />\nliberals claim allegiance to some<br />\nof his policies. For the conservatives, his foreign policy is<br />\nroundly acclaimed. After all, he<br />\nstopped Soviet aggression in<br />\nour hemisphere (Cuba). For<br />\nliberals, his domestic programs<br />\nwere widely acclaimed. His big<br />\npush for civil rights eventually<br />\nled (under his successor's administration) to vital reforms in<br />\nthe South. But most of all, both<br />\nconservatives and liberals look<br />\nback to that image of American<br />\ngrandeur as personified by his<br />\npresidency. William Manchester, in his new book One<br />\nBrief Shining Moment pays<br />\ntribute to the president that has<br />\ninspired so much worship. He<br />\ndoes for John F. Kennedy what<br />\nJoseph Alsop did for Franklin<br />\nRoosevelt in FDR:A Centenary<br />\nRemembrance, providing a telling though abbreviated portrait<br />\nfilled with pictures and<br />\nmemories. But it is no small<br />\nirony that while Alsop's book<br />\ncommemorates the one hundredth<br />\nanniversary<br />\nof<br />\nRoosevelt's birth, Manchester's<br />\nbook commemorates the twentieth anniversary of Kennedy's<br />\ndeath. In dying in office, Kennedy gained the immortality for<br />\nwhich Roosevelt had to<br />\nserve twelve years. But what<br />\nKennedy may eventually be<br />\nmost remembered for is that he<br />\ndied before the American people became disenchanted with<br />\nhim.<br />\nManchester's intention is to<br />\nprovide his reader with an inside glimpse of Kennedy's life.<br />\nHe seeks to \"recreate the past<br />\nfor the reader,\" and show the<br />\nevents \"happening\" as the<br />\nreader's \"eye roves down the<br />\npage\" so that the reader feels<br />\nthat he is \"actually there\"<br />\nwitnessing these events. Manchester is particularly well<br />\nqualified in this role as he was<br />\na close personal friend of the<br />\nKennedy family as well as official biographer of the President. Manchester provides the<br />\nreader with insider tidbits. We<br />\nlearn that Kennedy loved plays,<br />\nthat when he needed to be he<br />\ncould be a hardball politician,<br />\nthat Robert Frost was blinded<br />\nby the sun glaring from the<br />\nsnow when he got up to read his<br />\npoem during the inauguration<br />\nceremonies and thus was forced to read another poem that he<br />\nknew by heart, and that Lyndon Johnson was extremely<br />\nconciliatory after he lost the<br />\nDemocratic nomination in 1960<br />\n(he went so far as to suggest<br />\nthat LBJ now meant 'Let's<br />\nBack Jack!').<br />\nBut Manchester is strongest<br />\nwhen discussing Kennedy's<br />\nfamily life. He discusses how<br />\nthe Kennedy family had created<br />\ntheir own social enclave. In one<br />\ntelling passage, he describes the<br />\nrules for playing touch football<br />\n<br />\nMassachusset is Senator, he<br />\nrefused to take a forceful stand<br />\nagainst Senator Joe McCarthy<br />\nand not so coincidentally was<br />\nabsent the day of McCarthy's<br />\ncensure vote. Manchester<br />\nargues that he simply didn't<br />\nwant to go against the majority view in Massachussetts<br />\n(which was strongly supportive<br />\nof McCarthy). Perhaps this is<br />\na justifiable reason for the<br />\naverage political hack, but not<br />\nfor a courageous politician.<br />\nManchester insists that Kennedy was planning to get out of<br />\nVietnam immediately following<br />\nhis 1964 reelection victory. But<br />\nhis citations are selective in<br />\nsubstantiating this claim. If he<br />\nhad been a courageous politician, he Would have pulled out<br />\nof Vietnam before the 1964<br />\nelection. In fact, it isn't clear<br />\n<br />\nwhether he would have been<br />\nable to get the U.S. out<br />\nof Vietnam after the election,<br />\nconsidering how deeply the<br />\nU.S. had become mired in by<br />\nthen. Perhaps that would have<br />\nbeen the true test of his<br />\ncourage.<br />\nSince this is a very short<br />\nbook, a more extensive review<br />\nis inappropriate for the potentially interested reader. The success of this book is that it brings<br />\nback the shining moment,<br />\nbriefly and most appropriately<br />\nin pictures, as the everlasting<br />\nimage of the Kennedy Administration is all we've really<br />\nbeen left with. For Kennedy<br />\nworshippers, this book is a bible.

The horseshoe crab,<br />\nonce valued only as eel bait, is<br />\nrapidly being recognized<br />\n<br />\naround the world as an extremely important animal for<br />\nmedical experiments. Though<br />\nits eyes and muscle tissue are<br />\nalso researched, it is the<br />\nhorseshoe crab's distinctive<br />\nblue blood that has made it<br />\nmedically famous.<br />\nWhile its name implies that it<br />\nis a crab, the horseshoe crab is<br />\nactually more closely related to<br />\n<br />\na spider. It is a strange looking<br />\ncreature with a dark brown<br />\nchitin shell, eight eyes and six<br />\npairs of legs. It has a tail, called the telson, which threateningly resembles a sword. This<br />\ntail is really only used to help<br />\nitself turn over.

Dr. Ronald Berzofsky, who heads the laboratory's<br />\nhorseshoe crab project, explains that the horseshoe crabs<br />\nare first picked up three or four<br />\nmiles off the coast of Chincoteague, Virginia, then are<br />\nshipped to a laboratory for<br />\nbleeding, and are finally returned uninjured to the sea. The<br />\nhorseshoe crabs are collected<br />\ntwice a week and only between<br />\nthe months of April and August<br />\nwhen they are most plentiful<br />\nalong the coast. An average<br />\nday's catch is four hundred<br />\nhorseshoe crabs, of which the<br />\naverage animal size is two and<br />\na half feet in diameter.<br />\nThe horseshoe crab does not<br />\nhave a heart and has an open<br />\ncirculatory system. Blood is<br />\ndrawn via a needle from a<br />\nmembraneous sac at the hinge<br />\njoining the anterior to the back<br />\nshell. After blood is drawn, the<br />\nhorseshoe crab's blood cells,<br />\ncalled amebocytes, are isolated<br />\nand an extract is made from<br />\nthese cells. It is the extract<br />\nwhich is actually used in testing<br />\nsolutions for the presence of<br />\npyrogens.<br />\nThrough research, the contents of the amebocyte extract<br />\nand the biochemistry of the<br />\nclotting process have become<br />\nfairly well understood. Simply<br />\nput, a proenzyme present in the<br />\namebocytes reacts with a<br />\npyrogen to forni an active enzyme. This active enzyme acts<br />\nto cleave a clotting protein of<br />\nthe amebocyte into specific<br />\nfragments. These fragments<br />\nthen interact to form a threedimensional matrix\u2014that is,<br />\nthe clot.<br />\nThe tests may be made quantitative by adding to the extract<br />\nanother protein which reacts<br />\nwith (he active enzyme and produces a yellow color. The intensity of the yellow color increases with pyrogen concentration. By measuring the<br />\nintensity\u2014that<br />\nis,<br />\nthe<br />\nabsorbance\u2014of the resulting<br />\nsolution, one obtains an indirect measure of the pyrogen<br />\nconcentration.<br />\nThough the horseshoe crab's<br />\nblood has only been sought<br />\nafter for a short period of time,<br />\nits importance in medical<br />\nresearch is undeniable.

He told me the<br />\n\"vital statistics\": \"34% in our class; that's 2 more<br />\nthan last year\u2014pretty high, huh?\"<br />\n\"What?\" I replied. Then he walked away. I never<br />\nUnderstood that.<br />\nAs weeks passed I slowly got acclimated to this new<br />\nand wonderful world of women at Hopkins. They are<br />\nquite \"vogue-ish\" in many a way. They definitely<br />\nknow their styles whether it be those of the 80's, 60's<br />\nor 90's.<br />\nIf I had any advice to give this group of relatively<br />\nliberated women, it would be, \"Relax, and have a<br />\nGOOD time!\" They work very hard; too hard in fact.<br />\nI've seen those Chem E.'s, E.E.'s and B.M.E.'s burning away in the Hut through many a long night and<br />\nthose Writing Seminars gals work no less.<br />\nBut, aside from all this rubbish, I know a good thing<br />\nwhen I see one. These women know what they want<br />\nand they have a good time at it.<br />\nI realize I am already a junior here(and you're pro-bably reading this and saying who cares? This geek<br />\nwouldn't know a girl when he saw one). There is so<br />\nmuch more to be learned. For example, just recently<br />\nsome guy, I believe it was Alfred, was trying to explain to me something about a bus being beautiful.<br />\nI never knew that a bus could be so \"attractive\" as<br />\nhe described. I can't recall what its name was\u2014I<br />\nbelieve he said the \"Goocher Shuttle\". I don't know.<br />\nThere is\u2022still much to learn.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nThere's not much to be said about Hopkins women.'<br />\nThey're almost as bad as Hopkins men. Laces dress<br />\nwell sometimes, you know. Asexual machines, hungry<br />\njocks, immature lust bubbles, ego problems and high .<br />\nSAT scores. You never think of your friends as<br />\nHopkins students.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nFile Photo<br />\n<br />\nbe serious. When was the last time you tried to talk to get something better, well, that bugs me. Look, it<br />\nto one? You extend your personality when you extend took me a long time to get up the courage to ask you<br />\nyour hand, measuring up the person who's about to out, and let's face it, you're not Raquel Welch, but<br />\nshake it. Talking to guys is easy enough. Hmm, he you turned me down because you figured that you<br />\nlooks a little geekish, better talk about studies. My god, could do better. For ehrist's sake, get to know me. I<br />\na jock; \"Well, how about those Orioles?\" But girls want to get to know you. If I wasn't interested, I would<br />\nare different. You have to feel your way through the have gone up the road.<br />\nWill the jokes disappear? I doubt it. Will Hopkins<br />\ntalking. Sensitive about her looks, well, play up the<br />\nfact that beauty isn't what matters. Beautiful. Well women appreciate the anger and frustration behind<br />\nthen, talk about how important brains are, let her those jokes? I doubt that too. Looks bleak...<br />\n* * *<br />\nknow that when she walks around, you're thinking of<br />\ndon't<br />\ndo,<br />\nyou<br />\nWhatever<br />\nmind.<br />\nher magnificient<br />\nalienate her. But that's what's frightening; the girls<br />\nhere are too smart to be fooled by this. I don't know<br />\nabout other guys, but sometimes I feel like I'm made<br />\nof glass. Regardless of what color stain I'm wearing<br />\nat that time, I'm still transparent!<br />\nO.K., so now I'm trying my best to be pleasant.<br />\n'Why do you assume it's just another male boob on<br />\nthe make? It's all in my head, huh? Well, next time<br />\nyou go to the library, or the Hut, or the Rat, or<br />\nwherever it is that you spend your time, look for me.<br />\nI'll be the one who smiles at you, sort of sheepishly,<br />\nand then proceeds to shrink into the corner under a<br />\ncold stare (\"Will you take a look at that freak? He<br />\nsmiled at me. I'm positive he did. God, he's gross.\")<br />\nSure, a lot of guys here are out to get some while they<br />\ncan. But I'm not one of them. I swear it. Can't we<br />\nbe friends, please?<br />\nUnfortunately, this is not the best place to find<br />\nfriends. Let's face it, the level of competition is too<br />\ngreat. I don't like it, but I can live with it. However,<br />\nthe fact that a potential love-interest may be taking !<br />\nyour place in grad, med, or law school is a bit disquieting to some guys. Sure, your best friend may get<br />\ninto Harvard, and you don't, but then again, you<br />\ndon't marry your best friend.<br />\nFinally, I'd like to say something about a trait that<br />\nmany Hopkins women have, and which I find quite<br />\nannoying. This revolves around the fact that the boygirl ratio here is something around 3-1, and it goes<br />\nFile Photo<br />\nsomething like this: I asked you to go out with me,<br />\nand you turned me down. Maybe you just don't like Hopkins women: can't live with 'em, can't live without<br />\nme, fine. But if you're thinking, gosh, 3 to I, I'm sure 'em.<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nFor pete's sake, what am I supposed to do with it?<br />\nIt doesn't have assembly diagrams or operating instructions. Putting that racing set together for<br />\nChristmas was one hell of a lot easier than this. Ah,<br />\nbut what in the name of Christ am I talking about?<br />\nSimple. The human female, in particular, the<br />\nsubspecies Hopkinus Girlus.<br />\nYou know, it's funny, no matter how many jokes<br />\nthe guys here make, they all want (or almost all want)<br />\nto find a girl on campus. Why? Convenience? Someone to copy notes from? Common interests? Someone with a mind, who can talk to you while you're<br />\nhaving that celebratory cigarette? Yes, all this and more<br />\ncan be yours if you find the right one. So, why are<br />\nHopkins girls the Butt (pun intended) of so many<br />\njokes?<br />\nPeople tend to joke about things they're frightened<br />\nof, nervous about, or that they just plain dislike. Why<br />\nare Hopkins men frightened of Hopkins women? Let's<br />\n<br />\nFite Photo<br />\n<br />\n\fins Men and Women Discuss Each Other<br />\nA friend of mine asked me what I thought of<br />\nHopkins men. Hopkins men? I never considered the<br />\ntwo to be synonymous. I've thought of Northwestern<br />\nmen, Emory men, men from the University of Illinois<br />\nand once, during a period of desperation at a lacrosse<br />\ngame, I even considered a North Carolina man! But<br />\nHopkins\u2014never. I've even heard rumors that there are<br />\nmen here. I think I might have seen one leaving the<br />\nHut at 3:00 a.m. one morning. But I have yet to encounter one socially. I've met a few animals masquerading as men, and a few walking encyclopedias,.<br />\nbut none that quite measure up to the Tarheel attackman. Oh well, at least I'm getting a good academic<br />\neducation at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nThe Women Answer<br />\n\"...The sadist, the man who humiliates woman,<br />\nwhose show of power is a facade. The so-called heroes,<br />\nthe stance of a Hemingway or a Mailer in writing, the<br />\nfalse strength. All this was exposed, disposed of by<br />\nthese new women, too intelligent to be deceived, too<br />\nwise and too proud to be subjected to this display of<br />\npower which did not protect them (as former generations of women believed) but endangered their existence as individuals.\"<br />\n\u2014Anais Nin<br />\n\"In Favor of the Sensitive Man\"<br />\nPlaygirl 1974<br />\n***gust**<br />\nGuys at Hopkins? Where? This would be a lot easier<br />\nif I was supposed to write about boys. The text books<br />\naren't kidding: girls mature too much faster; or better said, it takes guys too long. Or maybe guys go<br />\nbackwards, really. I never thought this seriously until<br />\nI spent a year in a co-ed Dorm. I've never met so many<br />\n\"boys\" who have never kissed a woman. What happened to all the guys I kissed in high school, did they<br />\ndie off? Or does Hopkins only accept males who are<br />\nvirgins?<br />\nMaybe this really isn't the sort of thing a woman<br />\nshould complain about. I find innocence refreshing,<br />\nlike the next person. And I'm sure I am not the most<br />\ncarnally educated person on campus either. But I don't<br />\npretend to be anything else. I never had naked men<br />\nfrom Playgirl plastered on my walls, nor do I lie about<br />\nmy sexual experiences. What I think I'm trying to say<br />\nis that the Hopkins virgin male is ashamed of his innocence and does his best to cover it up with his<br />\nmachismo.<br />\nHopkins women are not easily fooled by this. So<br />\nthe macho virgin restricts himself to a diet of Goucher<br />\ngirls who won't notice, or care; and might just teach<br />\nhim what he needs to know. I'm not asking every college bound male to give it up in high school for us<br />\nwomen. I can appreciate a virgin. After all, I will never<br />\ncast my pearls before swine either. Yet in a rush to<br />\nfulfill the macho image instead of just pretending, a<br />\nHopkins male will do just that.<br />\n* * *<br />\nI think the guys here at Hopkins are really good<br />\nlooking. There are quite a few serious bods around.<br />\nBut have you ever noticed that they all have the worst<br />\ntaste in women. I have seen hunks going out with the<br />\nugliest pigs on campus.\"Maybe she gives good head\",<br />\nmy roommate says. Or \"Pussy has no face\". Shit,<br />\nturning the lights off isn't good enough for me; I can<br />\nfeel and smell ugly. And people see you walking<br />\naround with that thing. They stare at you. Guys I am<br />\nurging you, all you good looking Hopkins men, stay<br />\naway from ugly chicks. You are being greedy.

Of course to ge<br />\nan education that will hopefully enable us to assume<br />\na professional or prestigious career. For many of us<br />\nthat includes making a lot of money. Then one may<br />\nask what is the importance or significance of this<br />\nprestige or wealth? The answer is obvious: sex. Class<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nIn my career at Hopkins, I have met many rude men<br />\nand I've met a lot of boring men, but I've also found<br />\nsome truly good male friends. I adopted the policy<br />\nfreshman year: when/if you meet a guy that knows<br />\nsomething more than the MSE hours or the current<br />\nspecial at Eddies, hang onto him\u2014you've found someone different. It paid off in the end. After years of<br />\npatience, I find myself with a few men that have made<br />\nbeing at Hopkins a good and memorable experience.<br />\nDon't laugh, it's true!

First, it is<br />\ncinematographically beautiful.<br />\nI suppose it isn't difficult ot<br />\nfind pretty camera work in<br />\nAlaska, but in Never Cry Wolf,<br />\neven the indoor photography is<br />\ngood. Unlike most movies that<br />\nare \"beautiful\", Never Cry<br />\nWolf isn't boring.<br />\nNever Cry Wolf is about a<br />\nnaturalist, Tyler (Charles Martin Smith), who is looking for<br />\nan adventure. He volunteers to<br />\ntrack a pack of Arctic wolves<br />\nfor the government, which<br />\nbelieves that wolves are responsible for the decimation of the<br />\ncaribou. He is dropped in the<br />\nmiddle of the Alaskan mountains in late winter with a<br />\ncanoe, ten crates of supplies,<br />\nand his base oboe, which he intends to play for the wolves. He<br />\nestablishes \"Lupus Base One\"<br />\noutside a den inhabited by two<br />\nhandsome Arctic wolves, whom<br />\nhe names George and Angie,<br />\nand their pups, who are not appallingly cute. I was impressed<br />\nby the fact that the movie never<br />\ntries to make the animals seem<br />\n<br />\ncute or \"human\", which is<br />\nespecially surprising considering this is a Disney movie.<br />\nTyler becomes convinced<br />\nthat the wolves are not killing<br />\nmany caribou and in fact live<br />\nlargely on field mice. There is<br />\na very funny sequence when<br />\nTyler decides to prove that a<br />\nlarge mammal can live on field<br />\nmice, using himself as the test<br />\nanimal. He sets an elegant<br />\ntable, the best silver and china,<br />\na carafe of moose-juice(a blend<br />\nof Moosehead beer and grain<br />\nalcohol), and a tureen of mouse<br />\nstew. Later he becomes even<br />\nmore of a gourmet, preparing<br />\nfor himself such delicacies as<br />\nmouse brochette, mouse-on-aritz, and mouse au vin.<br />\nThe movie doesn't really go<br />\nanywhere. Tyler convinces<br />\nhimself that the wolves are only eating the sick caribou,<br />\nthough he doesn't think he will<br />\nbe able to convince the government. It doesn't really matter<br />\nthough, because in a little while<br />\nthe area will probably be<br />\nbulldozed and paved over by<br />\ncorrupt Man, typified by the<br />\nvicious pilot, Rosie (played with<br />\nambiguous malice by Brian<br />\nDennehy). Eventually, Tyler<br />\nwanders off with Unuk, a Inoit<br />\n(Eskimo) who saved his life early during the winter.<br />\n<br />\nThere are serious problems<br />\nwith the movie. It is a Walt<br />\nDisney release, and has an old<br />\nWalt Disney plot: a man of<br />\ncivilization becomes a part of<br />\nthe wilderness. The voice-over<br />\nnarration is atrocious; it makes<br />\nTyler, who acts intelligent,<br />\nsound like a fool, and doesn't<br />\nhelp the movie along at all. No<br />\nfewer than three writers pooled their incompetence to write<br />\nthe narration, and whatever effort they might have put into it<br />\ndoesn't show.<br />\nSometimes the movie takes<br />\nitself too seriously: dream sequences, mysterious black<br />\nwolves, ancient Indian legends,<br />\nthe kind of stuff that makes<br />\nbad movies really bad, all<br />\nweaken this good movie. Some<br />\nof Tyler's discussions with the<br />\nold Inoit (\"The wolf, it is my<br />\nguardian spirit\") are ridiculous<br />\nbecause the audience is supposed to believe this garbage.<br />\nPerhaps some people do accept<br />\nhokiness as authenticity; I just<br />\nforgave it on the grounds that<br />\nthere were so many other things<br />\nabout the movie that were<br />\nlikeable and authentic.<br />\nNever Cry Wolf is playing at<br />\nthe Rotunda ($2 student admission, Monday through Thursday) and I definitely recommend you go see it.<br />\n<br />\nStar 80<br />\nby Dan Vitale<br />\n<br />\nthe importance of appearances<br />\n<br />\nFor a movie based on a true<br />\nstory, Star 80 is unnervingly<br />\nfalse-hearted. Using almost<br />\nevery garish cinematic trick in<br />\nthe book, writer-director Bob<br />\nFosse turns the murder of<br />\nPlayboy model Dorothy Stratten into lurid trash even as he<br />\nattempts to condemn the kind<br />\nof trashy culture in which such<br />\nmurders occur. Fosse's telling<br />\nAmerica to stop picking its<br />\nnose, but he's got snot under<br />\nhis own fingernails and he<br />\ndoesn't seem to know it.<br />\nStratten was killed in August<br />\n1980 by her husband and<br />\nmanager, Paul Snider, who<br />\ndiscovered her in a Vancouver<br />\nDairy Queen, got her into Hugh<br />\nHefner's mansion as well as his<br />\nmagazine, and then watched as<br />\nshe began to leave him behind:<br />\nbecoming 1980's Playmate of<br />\nthe Year, embarking on a<br />\n<br />\nbacks up on him in ways he's<br />\nembarrassingly unaware of.<br />\nAs Stratten, Marie! Hemingway is a cipher, as much of<br />\na nonperson as the women who<br />\nappear in Playboy, in spite of<br />\nthe fact that she walks, talks,<br />\nand has affairs. It's hard to tell<br />\nif this is Hemingway's or<br />\nFosse's fault: the screenplay<br />\ngives us very little of her<br />\ncharacter. Granted, vacant innocence is difficult to portray<br />\nonscreen, but even when<br />\nDorothy starts making decisions on her own we are<br />\nmystified about her motives.<br />\nThe scenes in which she<br />\ngradually matures beyond<br />\nSnider's control would be effective only if we knew why she<br />\nfelt drawn to him in the first<br />\nplace. The movie seems incapable of showing us conscious, rational thought on<br />\nStratten's part.<br />\n<br />\nPlay: Same Time Next Year<br />\nby Charlie Scharf<br />\nThe Spotlighters Theatre has<br />\nbrought a wonderful presentation of Bernard Slade's comedy<br />\nSame Time Next Year to the<br />\nBaltimore stage. The play,<br />\nwhich opened February 3, stars<br />\nHarry Turner and Sallie Rixie<br />\nas George and Doris, two<br />\ncharacters who have a once a<br />\nyear love affair.<br />\nThe play is divided into<br />\nscenes which usually occur at<br />\nfive year intervals, thus enabling the audience to observe the<br />\nchanges in lifestyles that these<br />\ncharacters undergo. The<br />\ncharacters change with the<br />\ntimes; Doris evolves from a<br />\nhigh school dropout through a<br />\nsixties hippie into a woman of<br />\nhigh society. George's life<br />\nparallels Doris': as the play<br />\nopens, he seems insecure and<br />\nbumbling, but by the play's<br />\nend, he has becom a self confident businessman.<br />\nThe play begins with the couple waking the morning after<br />\ntheir first encounter. George<br />\ndoesn't even know Doris'<br />\nname, but the two seem to find<br />\na mutual attraction and they<br />\ncontinue to meet the same<br />\nweekend each year at the same<br />\nbungalow. The only hitch in<br />\nthis cozy arrangement is that<br />\nboth Doris and George are<br />\nmarried, to other people.<br />\nThe script is filled with one<br />\n<br />\nliners and they are indeed funny. The actors handle the snappy dialogue well.<br />\nRixie, whose acting career<br />\nbegan only two years ago,<br />\ndemonstrated that her talent is<br />\nfar greater than her experience.<br />\nRixie illustrated impressive versatility as her character'<br />\ndeveloped over the years.<br />\nHowever, her performance was<br />\na little uneven; some scenes<br />\nwere more polished than<br />\nothers.<br />\nThe slight deficiencies in her<br />\nstage presence were magnified<br />\nby the outstanding performance of her co-star, Harry<br />\nTurner. Turner proved himself<br />\nto be obviously experienced and<br />\nvery flexible as an actor. As an<br />\ninsecure accountant, Turner<br />\ndisplays nervousness and tension in an extremely realistic<br />\nmanner. His portrayal of the<br />\nolder, more self-confident<br />\nbusinessman was equally as<br />\nbelievable, illustrating the range<br />\nof his acting ability. Turner's<br />\nexpressions and movements left<br />\nthe observer with a satisfied<br />\nempathetic feeling, as if they,<br />\ntoo, were participants in the<br />\nscenes.<br />\nthe Spotlight, \u2022 is a %Mail,<br />\nso<br />\ntheatre-in -the-round,<br />\neveryone in the audience is close<br />\nto the actors. This helps the audience draw into the scene and<br />\ncomplements the intimate<br />\nmood of the play.<br />\n<br />\nNonetheless, this setting<br />\nseemed to present a challenge<br />\nfor the actors. Owing to the<br />\nproximity of the audience, the<br />\nactors' every gesture was<br />\navailable for scrutiny, but they<br />\nintimacy<br />\nthis<br />\nhandled<br />\nreasonably well.<br />\nTurner was also the cod i rector, but his directing was<br />\novershadowed by his fine acting.

Despite their<br />\nthe<br />\nskills,<br />\nportrayors'<br />\ncharacters occasionally seemed<br />\nout of place on the stage and<br />\ntheir movements at times appeared to be artificial.<br />\nThe play was presented<br />\nwithout extravagant scenery or<br />\nlighting, but the technical<br />\naspects suited this production<br />\nwell.

Until now, they<br />\nhave been close, but still,<br />\nsomething is lacking.<br />\nWhile the team sports a 12-3<br />\nrecord, Hopkins' lackluster<br />\nperformance of late has Coach<br />\nRichard Oles alarmed. The<br />\ncoach is concerned that many<br />\nof the fencers are still making<br />\nmistakes they made at the start<br />\nof the season, even after working on them in practice.<br />\nThrough the use of videotape<br />\nas well as personal critiques of<br />\neach fencer by the coach, the<br />\nBlue Jays hope to work out the<br />\nflaws in their game and take the<br />\nconference championships. As<br />\nof this week, it has been a slow<br />\nprocess with fewer results than<br />\nthe coach would like to see.<br />\nThis past weekend was a<br />\nperfect example. The team won<br />\na thriller against Duke University on Friday, with the contest<br />\ngoing down to the last bout, a<br />\n5-4 win by Andy Goldberg.<br />\nScoring points in the Shaffer<br />\nplayer-of-the-year award were<br />\ncaptains Taro Adachi and<br />\nDavid Wiener with 3-0 performances.

When<br />\nasked about the performance<br />\nagainst last year's MAC<br />\nchamps, Oles replied,\"We lost<br />\n<br />\nsix 5-4 bouts while winning only two. The sabre fell apart in<br />\nthis one and everyone fell down<br />\nin pressure situations.\"<br />\nHopkins got tough in the second meet against Stevens Tech<br />\nof Hoboken(!), N.J. Down 4-5<br />\nafter the first round, the Jays<br />\nreversed the situation in the second round to take a 10-8 lead.<br />\nThe team held on for a 15-12<br />\nvictory with Adachi and<br />\n<br />\nGoldberg each racking up three<br />\nwins.<br />\nOverall, the foil team is still<br />\nred hot with a 14-1 mark, while<br />\nthe sabre and epee teams are<br />\nlooking to improve by the<br />\nMAC's. And at 12-3, Oles<br />\nshould be happy with his<br />\nswordsmen. Still the Coach is<br />\nquick to point out that two of<br />\nthe three defeats were at the<br />\nhands of MAC members.<br />\n<br />\nFor the next two weeks the<br />\nteam will be concentrating on<br />\nconsistency, something even the<br />\nbest fencers have lacked at<br />\ntimes.

I've seen Ray in heartbreak losses, where he never<br />\nrefused to come on TV, even<br />\nthough maybe his number one<br />\nranked team had just been<br />\nknocked out of the tournament<br />\nby St. Joseph's. It was a terrible blow, but Ray handled it<br />\nwith grace.

But students objected because<br />\nthey wanted to study far, far away from the<br />\nfamiliar surroundings of the dorms\u2014<br />\nfreshmen because they lived there and upperclassmen because they used to live there.<br />\nNow Martin has another suggestion. She<br />\nwants to convert the Garrett Room into an<br />\nundergraduate reading room. But students<br />\nare objecting again because they want to<br />\nstudy far, far away from the sterile surroundings of the MSE Library.<br />\nTwo years. Two suggestions. Two ways<br />\nto get rid of the Hutzler Undergraduate<br />\nLibrary as the undergraduate reading room.<br />\nAnd both times, students have objected, but<br />\nthis time, the problem is more serious. Last<br />\nyear's suggestion was just that\u2014a<br />\nsuggestion\u2014but this year's suggestion has<br />\nturned into a proposal, already submitted to<br />\nPresident Steven Muller and to Provost and<br />\nVice President of Academic Affairs Richard<br />\nLongaker. And that's the problem. The administration, once again, has neglected to<br />\nconsult with the students. They didn't consult With students when they reorganized the<br />\ndean structure nor did they consult with<br />\nstudents when they selected the deans. So<br />\nwhy should this time be any different? The<br />\nadministration is succeeding at being consistent, but unfortunately, reputations result<br />\nfrom consistent actions, and the administration is getting a reputation of not listening<br />\nto students, or better yet, of not seeking<br />\nstudents' opinions.<br />\nIssue after issue, the administration says<br />\nthey want to make improvements which<br />\nwould benefit both students and faculty.<br />\nWell, this time, the improvements would be<br />\nat the expense of a sacred campus<br />\ninstitution\u2014an institution that's been part<br />\nof Hopkins for 20 years.<br />\nTo be sure, the MSE Library needs more<br />\nroom, but converting the Hut into a Special<br />\nCollections Room and converting the Garrett Room into a combination reading<br />\nroom/reserve room is not the solution.<br />\nIt appears that the administration wants<br />\nto make Gilman Hall a showplace with the<br />\nSpecial Collections Room as its centerpiece.<br />\nDuring the summer of 1985, the dean of the<br />\narts and sciences and the dean of engineering are scheduled to move into the east wing<br />\nof Gilman. At the same time, the other<br />\ndeans, along with the political economy, the<br />\npolitical science, and the sociology departments, will move to Mergenthaler Hall'.<br />\nThus, Gilman will house the humanities<br />\ndepartments, the two principle deans, and<br />\neither Hut I or Hut II.<br />\nHut I is a place where students socialize<br />\nand study, both during the day and at night.<br />\nDuring the day, students either sit in the coffee shop area or in the Hut itself. They wait,<br />\nfor upcoming classes. Or they talk. Or they<br />\nread magazines and newspapers. Or they<br /><br />\nfinish assignments. Or they just relax. 'They'<br />\neven includes many faculty members who<br />\nalso, not surprisingly, enjoy reading<br />\nperiodicals, flip through reference books,<br />\nand drink tea at the coffee shop which will<br />\nbe moved if Hut I becomes Hut II.<br />\nHut II will be an air-conditioned Special<br />\nCollections Room with rare books occupying one-third of it and carpet and chairs occupying two-thirds of it. Air conditioning is<br />\nthe only reason people would want to stay<br />\nin Hut II. Rare books, because of the acid<br />\nin their pages, tend to deteriorate if they<br />\naren't stored properly. Hut I currently is not<br />\nair-conditioned. Instead, large fans prevent<br />\npeople from deteriorating during hot<br />\nweather.<br />\nHut II will be a place where receptions can<br />\nbe held and where the Trustees can meet.<br />\nThere's no other reason to house rare books<br />\nin a Special Collections Room. Hut II will<br />\nbe a reception area with a showcase to impress people. And that's all.<br />\nSince Hut II will not be open 24 hours and<br />\nsince it will be too fancy(most likely, smoking will not be allowed because of the rare<br />\nbooks), students will have to go to the Garrett Room (most likely, smoking will not be<br />\nallowed because of the small area) which will<br />\nbe a combination reading room/reserve<br />\nroom, open 24 hours. The present reserve<br />\nroom and map room on M level will then<br />\nprovide more space for students to study<br />\nduring the regular library hours, but this additional space won't be available between<br />\nmidnight and eight in the morning. Thus,<br />\nstudents won't be able to take reserve<br />\nmaterial out of the noisy and crowded Garrett Room. Currently, most students read<br />\nreserve material elsewhere. So the library will<br />\nhave to change the reserve policy or install<br />\na few photocopying machines.<br />\nThe Garrett Room's conversion will also<br />\ndecrease the amount of available meeting<br />\nspace on campus, which is already a problem. Using rooms in Levering Hall is a<br />\nnossibility, but so is converting some of those<br />\nrooms into reading rooms.<br />\nYes, more space is needed for books. Yes,<br />\nmore space is needed for students to study.<br />\nYes, rare books are important, and they<br />\nshould be stored in a central location.<br />\nBut other aspects of campus, especially<br />\nthose aspects affecting social life, should also<br />\nbe considered. The Rat. The Student Union.<br />\nThe Glass Pavilion. The Great Hall. And the<br />\nlist goes on. As Dean of Arts and Sciences<br />\nGeorge Fisher said, \"Everything must be<br />\ncondidered as a package.\"<br />\nThe solution is not simple. Students, faculty members, and administrators must sit<br />\ndown and talk about the future. Until that<br />\nhappens, communication will continue to he<br />\nthe main problem on this campus.<br />\nBut for now, the Hutzler Undergraduate<br />\nLibrary must be preserved as the Hut and<br />\nnot as a museum for a Special Books<br />\nCollection.<br /><br />\nRatting on the Thieves<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhen I read the article in last<br />\nweek's News-Letter concerning<br />\nthe rats that were stolen from<br />\nAmes Hall, I was mortified. It<br />\nnever ceases to amaze me how<br />\nsome people can be so stupid<br />\nand have such a limited<br />\nmentality.<br />\nI wonder if the members of<br />\nthe Animal Liberation Front<br />\nknow how many of their<br />\nrelatives are alive today thanks<br />\nto the \"pointless and repulsive\"<br />\nexperiments that have been performed on laboratory animals.<br />\nI wonder if they know how<br />\nmany vaccines they themselves<br />\nhave been treated with that<br />\nwere developed and tested in<br />\nlaboratory animals. I do not<br />\nthink that they do.<br />\nIt did my heart good to read<br />\nthe quote from the press release<br />\nissued by the Animal Liberation Front: \"during the<br />\nChristmas season there can be<br />\nno peace on earth as long as we<br />\ncontinue to destroy this planet<br />\nand its inhabitants.\"<br />\nHow then can there be peace<br />\nas long as little children go to<br />\nbed hungry every night and<br />\nwake up to an empty breakfast<br />\ntable every morning of every<br />\nseason of the year? If the efforts of these, \"do-gooders\"<br />\nwere shifted from stealing<br />\nlaboratory rats to stopping pain<br />\nand suffering of human beings<br />\nthroughout the world, then<br />\nmaybe all those children would<br />\nnot have to die of hunger each<br />\nyear and \"peace on earth\"<br />\ncould be achieved.<br />\nWe must remember that the<br />\nneeds of the many outweigh the<br />\nneeds of the few, or better yet,<br />\nthe needs of the human race<br />\noutweigh the needs of the<br />\nanimal race.<br />\nHowever, being an animal<br />\nlover myself, I must be fair and<br />\noffer a suggestion to reduce the<br />\npain and suffering of these<br />\npoor creatures while still saving<br />\nthe lives that medical research<br />\ndoes each year; therefore, I<br />\npropose that we free all<br />\nlaboratory animals and use the<br />\nmembers of the Animal Liberation Front for all these<br />\n\"pointless\" experiments.<br />\nI am sure they would agree<br /><br />\nsince they are so committed to<br />\nsaving these animals. Besides, it<br />\nwould save money and show us<br />\nexactly what effect the treatment will have on humans instead of using animals as<br />\nmodels.<br />\nSincerely,<br />\nJim Pellicane<br /><br />\nThe Hut<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThrough various sources, we<br />\nhave been informed that the<br />\ndecision to close the Hutzler<br />\nUndergraduate Library may<br />\nhave already been made by Dr.<br />\nSusan Martin, Director of<br />\nLibrary Services, without<br />\nknowledge of the student body.<br />\nIf this is the case, it would appear that the Student Council's<br />\npresent attempt to deal with the<br />\nissue and to poll for the student<br />\nbody's opinion is a futile effort.<br />\nWe sincerely hope that we have<br />\nbeen misinformed, and that Dr.<br />\nMartin and the Administration<br />\nwill carefully evaluate the situation before making a decision<br />\nwhich will have an immeasurable impact on the<br />\nundergraduate community. We<br />\nfeel that the Administration is<br />\nnot fully aware of the purpose<br />\nwhich the 'Hut' serves or the<br />\nqualities that it possesses which<br />\nmake the 'Hut' indispensable.<br />\nFor this reason, we have included the following:<br />\nI. With regard to the Hut, its<br />\ncentral location makes it an<br />\nideal place for students to go<br />\nbetween classes in order to<br />\nstudy or to, read current<br />\nmagazines and daily papers. Its<br />\nphysical design allows for<br />\nsmoking and non-smoking<br />\nareas and makes the room comfortable for studying as opposed to the MSE Library which<br />\nhas few \"comfortable\" places<br />\nto study and suffers from poor<br />\nlighting and poor ventilation.<br />\nCurrent periodicals are easily<br />\naccessible. It provides a place<br />\nfor group study. It is open 24<br />\nhours a day, seven days a week.<br />\nIt has a non-circulating collection of reference books, which<br />\nis invaluable once the MSE<br />\nLibrary is closed.

With regard to the new 'Hut'<br />\non Q-Level in the east wing of<br />\nthe MSE Library, will it be able<br />\nto accomodate as many people<br />\nas the Hut? Will it be as \"comfortable\" a study facility as the<br />\nHut (i.e., large tables, soft<br />\nchairs, couches? Will it be as<br />\naesthetically appealing as the<br />\nHut? We realize that people<br />\noften fail to comment on this<br />\naspect of the Hut, but quite<br />\nfrankly, we do not think that a<br />\nrare book collection will fully<br />\nappreciate the architecture or<br />\nthe windows)? Will it have a<br />\nnon-circulating reference collection? We feel that the atmosphere created by the Hut,<br />\none which is conducive to studying cannot be recreated at the<br />\nproposed location. Also, what<br />\nwill happen to the Garrett<br />\nRoom? There is already a shortage of rooms in which various<br />\ngroups can meet.<br />\n3. With regard to the space in<br />\nthe renovated dorms and its<br />\npossible role if the Hut is closed, this was intended as new<br />\nspace to be used for social purposes, not to replace rooms used for other purposes. The<br />\ndorm atmosphere is not conducive to studying; it is not a<br />\ncentral location on campus.<br />\nA student affiliation with the<br />\nuniversity does not end once<br />\nclasses are finished for the day.<br />\nMany hours are spent studying,.<br />\nresearching, working on other<br />\nacademic pursuits. It is for thisi<br />\nreason that the Hut plays a<br />\nsignificant role for many<br />\nundergraduates. Dr. Martin<br />\nand the Administration do not<br />\nseem to be aware of this. We<br />\nsuggest that you come visit the<br />\nHut after the MSE Library has<br />\nclosed and observe the activityi<br />\nwhich occurs during the early,<br />\nmorning hours. The night.<br />\nbefore a biochemistry or,<br />\norganic chemistry exam or the<br />\nnight before an engineering<br />\nassignment is due would be<br />\nideal, but any night will do. We<br />\nhave been there al night<br />\n(weekends included) at some<br />\npoint in our three years at<br />\nHopkins and have never been<br />\nwithout company! Also, it<br />\nshould be noted that during the<br /><br />\nday, there is plenty of activity<br />\nin the Hut for previously stated<br />\nreasons.<br />\nWith regard to the rare book<br />\ncollection, why not put it in<br />\nHomewood House or some<br />\nother location which has<br />\nalready been removed from student use? We are sure that there<br />\nare many places which could<br />\naccomodate the collection and<br />\nnot have such a significant impact on the students.<br />\nIn closing, we ask students to<br />\nmake use of the Student Council Response Boxes. If you do<br />\nnot, rumor has it (and we hope<br />\nthat it is wrong) that the Hut<br />\nmay be gone before the end of<br />\nthe semester. We also ask Dr.<br />\nMartin and the Administration<br />\nto directly address this issue and<br />\nto justify their intended course<br />\nof action.<br />\nLaurie Hastings<br />\nLisa Nalven<br />\nClass of '85<br />\nP.S. What will happen to the<br />\nGilman Coffee Shop if tne Hut<br />\ncloses?<br /><br />\nGuys and Gals<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe News-Letter is so frequently irresponsible that I<br />\nhardly react to it anymore, yet<br />\nthe appearance of \"Feminism<br />\nAbounds I and 11\" demands<br />\nsome response. I understand<br />\nthat it is News-Letter policy to<br />\nprint any letter that drops in its<br />\npath, but I wonder why the<br />\nNews-Letter would print<br />\nsomething as inflammatory, ignorant and schizoid as<br />\n\"Feminism Abounds\" without<br />\nsome editorial comment. This<br />\nindicates to me that the NewsLetter staff is as aware of<br />\nfeminist issues as the author of<br />\n\"Feminism Abounds.\"<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIn general, and on this cam'pus in particular, people (I use<br />\nthat word with generosity) have<br />\na grave misunderstanding of<br />\nwho feminists are and what<br />\ntheir goals are. A lot of men<br />\nwould like to disregard<br />\nfeminists as a bunch of women<br />\n(they probably would not use<br />\nthat word) who are easily offended, or more to the point,<br />\nwho just don't get enough. The<br />\ntask of defining feminism in-<br /><br />\ntelligently and fairly is a broad,<br />\ncomplex one, but the table is<br />\nnot nearly as important as the<br />\nissues behind it. Feminism is<br />\nnot bra burning\u2014the bras were<br />\nburned in the 60s and 70s. In<br />\nthe 80s, feminism concerns<br />\nitself with how society (and its<br />\ninhabitants) view women at<br />\npresent and historically, how<br />\nwomen view themselves and<br />\nhow the two will affect<br />\nwomen's expectations for<br />\nthemselves. The first step<br />\ntoward abounding feminism is<br />\ndispelling the sort of myth<br />\nabout women perpetuated (and<br />\ncreated) by people like Mr.<br />\nSchizoid from California. I<br />\nleave him anonymous because<br />\nhe is not an individual\u2014he is a<br />\nrepresentative of the warped<br />\nideas that have constrained<br />\nwomen for centuries. Once<br />\nthese myths are disarmed, we<br />\ncan begin to change those structures in society that institutionalize sex bias. Like<br />\nHopkins, for example.<br />\nHopkins admitted women<br />\nover ten years ago and still<br />\nwomen comprise only one third<br />\n(roughly)of the population. In<br />\nfact, the percentage of women<br />\nhas grown very little since the<br />\nearly 70s. All of you neanderthals out there are probably<br />\nsaying<br />\nto<br />\n(satisfiedly)<br />\nyourselves that there just aren't<br />\nenough women smart enough.<br />\nThe number of male and<br />\nfemale applicants is more<br />\nbalanced than the population<br />\nrepresents and I tend to think<br />\nif there were a desire to balance<br />\nthe student body, it could be<br />\ndone without sacrificing<br />\nHopkins' standards. The point<br />\nis that Hopkins is not<br />\ncoeducational\u2014it is a men's<br />\nschool that has conceded to admitting women. A Hopkins<br />\nwoman can never forget (if<br />\nshe's at all aware) that this is a<br />\nmale oriented place. It is blatant in all spheres of Hopkins<br />\nlife. The great majority of professors are white males and the<br />\ncurriculum itself is white male<br />\ndesigned and oriented.<br />\nThere is no better exhibition<br />\nof Hopkins' image of<br />\n\"women\" than the frat scene.<br />\nThe social life revolves around<br />\nan institution that is male<br />\ndominated and degrading to<br /><br />\nPACTOUL<br />\n3<br /><br />\nSuSMITTID FOR TOUR APPUOTAL, MYRON J.

I can hardly imagine that the authors really<br />\nbelieve that what they are saying is true, just as I can't believe<br />\nthat Mr. Schizoid believes<br />\nhimself. The thing they have in<br />\ncommon is that they are all<br />\nangry and I don't understand<br />\nwhy.<br />\nMr. Schizoid does (inadvertantly) bring forth an important<br />\nissue.

Johnson, are singularly<br />\nresponsible for sexual crimes,<br />\nspousal and child abuse.<br />\nStatistics prove that the majority. of sex crimes or familial<br />\nabuse are perpetrated by men.<br />\nWomen are not responsible for<br />\ndeviant male behavior. A long<br />\nawaited step in a positive direction is the female realization<br />\nthat one need not keep silent or<br />\nremain in abusive situations.<br />\nJohnson's opinions concerning the course of history attempt to vindicate a system of<br />\noppressive domination, and<br />\nconclude with the burden of<br />\nnuclear proliferation and the<br />\nprospect of war placed solely<br />\non the shoulders of women.<br />\nMarion A. Schreiber<br /><br />\nFeminism Defined<br />\nTo the Editor...<br /><br />\nJoanne Rachel Applebaum<br /><br />\nSupporting Evidence<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWayne L. Johnson's masterful diatribe on feminism lacks<br />\nonly a few easily verifiable<br />\nstatistics and data to perfect his<br />\ncogent arguments. As a public<br />\nservice, I should like to reveal<br />\nthese startling facts and figures:<br />\nI. Women have been proven to<br />\nbe associated with 100% of all<br />\ndivorce cases, and can therefore<br />\nbe shown to be at the root of<br />\nAmerica's divorce troubles.<br />\n2. Women have been directly<br />\nimplicated as responsible for<br />\nbringing into this world every<br />\nmurderer, rapist, criminal<br />\nand\u2014God forbid\u2014feminist.<br />\n3. Without women, all war,<br />\ncrime and other female inspired<br />\nevil would vanish in a single<br />\ngeneration.<br />\n4. The feminist rulers of the<br />\nNew<br />\nTestament<br />\nworld<br />\npersecuted<br />\nmankind so<br />\nruthlessly that no historian then<br />\nor since has dared even<br />\nacknowledge the existence of<br />\nmore than a handful of these<br />\ndemons.<br />\n5. The word \"mother\" is a<br />\nswear word in enlightened<br />\ncircles of the American public.<br />\n6. God himself was so .arned<br /><br />\nLast weeks' letter entitled<br />\n\"Feminism Abounds 11\" concluded: \"...the suppression of<br />\n(women by men) destroys the<br />\nlove between the two.\". The<br />\nconclusion is illogical, tacked<br />\non as it is to a tirade on the evils<br />\nof feminism. What feminists<br />\nbelieve and what Johnson<br />\nclaims to believe, is that one<br />\nshould \"make love, not<br />\nwar\"\u2014in other words, coexist<br />\npeacefully with others. But the<br />\nmeans feminists choose in order<br />\nto achieve this end are<br />\nsomewhat different from those<br />\nJohnson advocates. Feminists<br />\nbelieve that rather than women<br />\naccepting a subordiante position in society in order to avoid<br />\nconflicts, people should<br />\nrecognize that only equality<br />\nguarantees harmonious social<br />\nrelations. The exclusion of<br />\ncoercion implicit in equality<br />\nallows the full development of<br />\nhuman potential. Equality of<br />\ntwo different groups (whether<br />\nof race, religion or sex) will<br />\nnever be attained when one<br />\nconsistently uses the other as a<br />\nscapegoat for society's ills. This<br />\nform of blame is what Mr.<br />\nJohnson is employing and what<br />\nwe protest.<br />\nLouise Spiegler<br />\nMargo Abels<br />\nAnne Jackley<br />\nThe Hopkins Women's Center<br /><br />\n6/FEBRUARY 10 1984<br /><br />\nMajoring in Economics<br />\nand wondering about<br /><br />\nCareer Options?<br />\nCome to a Forum on<br /><br />\nFinancial Professions<br /><br />\nTHE HOPKINS<br /><br />\nJIGAMSA<br />\nJewish Inter-professionals, Graduate<br />\nAnd Medical Students Association<br />\nHas a cure for the mid-winter blues<br /><br />\nCome to our...<br /><br />\nFebruary 16 at 4:00<br />\nin the Great Hall<br /><br />\nTHIRD ANNUAL<br /><br />\nCOFFEEHOUSE<br />\n\u2022 *. # *<br />\nFeaturing live music, refreshments and drinks<br /><br />\nSpeakers will be from:<br />\nMercantile Safe Deposit and Loan<br />\nMerrill Lynch<br />\nJHU Investment Management<br /><br />\n$3.00 Admission - Cash Bar<br />\n8:00 P.m.<br />\nSunday, Feb. 19<br />\nBrittany Apts.

Both<br />\ntoday's conservatives and<br />\nliberals claim allegiance to some<br />\nof his policies. For the conservatives, his foreign policy is<br />\nroundly acclaimed. After all, he<br />\nstopped Soviet aggression in<br />\nour hemisphere (Cuba). For<br />\nliberals, his domestic programs<br />\nwere widely acclaimed. His big<br />\npush for civil rights eventually<br />\nled (under his successor's administration) to vital reforms in<br />\nthe South. But most of all, both<br />\nconservatives and liberals look<br />\nback to that image of American<br />\ngrandeur as personified by his<br />\npresidency. William Manchester, in his new book One<br />\nBrief Shining Moment pays<br />\ntribute to the president that has<br />\ninspired so much worship. He<br />\ndoes for John F. Kennedy what<br />\nJoseph Alsop did for Franklin<br />\nRoosevelt in FDR:A Centenary<br />\nRemembrance, providing a telling though abbreviated portrait<br />\nfilled with pictures and<br />\nmemories. But it is no small<br />\nirony that while Alsop's book<br />\ncommemorates the one hundredth<br />\nanniversary<br />\nof<br />\nRoosevelt's birth, Manchester's<br />\nbook commemorates the twentieth anniversary of Kennedy's<br />\ndeath. In dying in office, Kennedy gained the immortality for<br />\nwhich Roosevelt had to<br />\nserve twelve years. But what<br />\nKennedy may eventually be<br />\nmost remembered for is that he<br />\ndied before the American people became disenchanted with<br />\nhim.<br />\nManchester's intention is to<br />\nprovide his reader with an inside glimpse of Kennedy's life.<br />\nHe seeks to \"recreate the past<br />\nfor the reader,\" and show the<br />\nevents \"happening\" as the<br />\nreader's \"eye roves down the<br />\npage\" so that the reader feels<br />\nthat he is \"actually there\"<br />\nwitnessing these events. Manchester is particularly well<br />\nqualified in this role as he was<br />\na close personal friend of the<br />\nKennedy family as well as official biographer of the President. Manchester provides the<br />\nreader with insider tidbits.

The horseshoe crab,<br />\nonce valued only as eel bait, is<br />\nrapidly being recognized<br /><br />\naround the world as an extremely important animal for<br />\nmedical experiments. Though<br />\nits eyes and muscle tissue are<br />\nalso researched, it is the<br />\nhorseshoe crab's distinctive<br />\nblue blood that has made it<br />\nmedically famous.<br />\nWhile its name implies that it<br />\nis a crab, the horseshoe crab is<br />\nactually more closely related to<br /><br />\na spider. It is a strange looking<br />\ncreature with a dark brown<br />\nchitin shell, eight eyes and six<br />\npairs of legs. It has a tail, called the telson, which threateningly resembles a sword. This<br />\ntail is really only used to help<br />\nitself turn over.

Dr. Ronald Berzofsky, who heads the laboratory's<br />\nhorseshoe crab project, explains that the horseshoe crabs<br />\nare first picked up three or four<br />\nmiles off the coast of Chincoteague, Virginia, then are<br />\nshipped to a laboratory for<br />\nbleeding, and are finally returned uninjured to the sea. The<br />\nhorseshoe crabs are collected<br />\ntwice a week and only between<br />\nthe months of April and August<br />\nwhen they are most plentiful<br />\nalong the coast. An average<br />\nday's catch is four hundred<br />\nhorseshoe crabs, of which the<br />\naverage animal size is two and<br />\na half feet in diameter.<br />\nThe horseshoe crab does not<br />\nhave a heart and has an open<br />\ncirculatory system. Blood is<br />\ndrawn via a needle from a<br />\nmembraneous sac at the hinge<br />\njoining the anterior to the back<br />\nshell. After blood is drawn, the<br />\nhorseshoe crab's blood cells,<br />\ncalled amebocytes, are isolated<br />\nand an extract is made from<br />\nthese cells. It is the extract<br />\nwhich is actually used in testing<br />\nsolutions for the presence of<br />\npyrogens.<br />\nThrough research, the contents of the amebocyte extract<br />\nand the biochemistry of the<br />\nclotting process have become<br />\nfairly well understood. Simply<br />\nput, a proenzyme present in the<br />\namebocytes reacts with a<br />\npyrogen to forni an active enzyme. This active enzyme acts<br />\nto cleave a clotting protein of<br />\nthe amebocyte into specific<br />\nfragments. These fragments<br />\nthen interact to form a threedimensional matrix\u2014that is,<br />\nthe clot.<br />\nThe tests may be made quantitative by adding to the extract<br />\nanother protein which reacts<br />\nwith (he active enzyme and produces a yellow color. The intensity of the yellow color increases with pyrogen concentration. By measuring the<br />\nintensity\u2014that<br />\nis,<br />\nthe<br />\nabsorbance\u2014of the resulting<br />\nsolution, one obtains an indirect measure of the pyrogen<br />\nconcentration.<br />\nThough the horseshoe crab's<br />\nblood has only been sought<br />\nafter for a short period of time,<br />\nits importance in medical<br />\nresearch is undeniable.

The<br />\nprimary reason for the small<br />\nnumber of research institutions<br />\noperating NMR devices is the<br />\nprohibitive costs of such equipment.

This revolves around the fact that the boygirl ratio here is something around 3-1, and it goes<br />\nFile Photo<br />\nsomething like this: I asked you to go out with me,<br />\nand you turned me down.

The human female, in particular, the<br />\nsubspecies Hopkinus Girlus.<br />\nYou know, it's funny, no matter how many jokes<br />\nthe guys here make, they all want (or almost all want)<br />\nto find a girl on campus. Why? Convenience? Someone to copy notes from? Common interests? Someone with a mind, who can talk to you while you're<br />\nhaving that celebratory cigarette? Yes, all this and more<br />\ncan be yours if you find the right one. So, why are<br />\nHopkins girls the Butt (pun intended) of so many<br />\njokes?<br />\nPeople tend to joke about things they're frightened<br />\nof, nervous about, or that they just plain dislike. Why<br />\nare Hopkins men frightened of Hopkins women? Let's<br /><br />\nFite Photo<br /><br />\nins Men and Women Discuss Each Other<br />\nA friend of mine asked me what I thought of<br />\nHopkins men. Hopkins men? I never considered the<br />\ntwo to be synonymous. I've thought of Northwestern<br />\nmen, Emory men, men from the University of Illinois<br />\nand once, during a period of desperation at a lacrosse<br />\ngame, I even considered a North Carolina man! But<br />\nHopkins\u2014never. I've even heard rumors that there are<br />\nmen here. I think I might have seen one leaving the<br />\nHut at 3:00 a.m. one morning. But I have yet to encounter one socially. I've met a few animals masquerading as men, and a few walking encyclopedias,.<br />\nbut none that quite measure up to the Tarheel attackman. Oh well, at least I'm getting a good academic<br />\neducation at Hopkins.<br /><br />\nThe Women Answer<br />\n\"...The sadist, the man who humiliates woman,<br />\nwhose show of power is a facade. The so-called heroes,<br />\nthe stance of a Hemingway or a Mailer in writing, the<br />\nfalse strength. All this was exposed, disposed of by<br />\nthese new women, too intelligent to be deceived, too<br />\nwise and too proud to be subjected to this display of<br />\npower which did not protect them (as former generations of women believed) but endangered their existence as individuals.\"<br />\n\u2014Anais Nin<br />\n\"In Favor of the Sensitive Man\"<br />\nPlaygirl 1974<br />\n***gust**<br />\nGuys at Hopkins? Where? This would be a lot easier<br />\nif I was supposed to write about boys. The text books<br />\naren't kidding: girls mature too much faster; or better said, it takes guys too long. Or maybe guys go<br />\nbackwards, really. I never thought this seriously until<br />\nI spent a year in a co-ed Dorm. I've never met so many<br />\n\"boys\" who have never kissed a woman. What happened to all the guys I kissed in high school, did they<br />\ndie off? Or does Hopkins only accept males who are<br />\nvirgins?<br />\nMaybe this really isn't the sort of thing a woman<br />\nshould complain about. I find innocence refreshing,<br />\nlike the next person. And I'm sure I am not the most<br />\ncarnally educated person on campus either. But I don't<br />\npretend to be anything else. I never had naked men<br />\nfrom Playgirl plastered on my walls, nor do I lie about<br />\nmy sexual experiences. What I think I'm trying to say<br />\nis that the Hopkins virgin male is ashamed of his innocence and does his best to cover it up with his<br />\nmachismo.<br />\nHopkins women are not easily fooled by this. So<br />\nthe macho virgin restricts himself to a diet of Goucher<br />\ngirls who won't notice, or care; and might just teach<br />\nhim what he needs to know. I'm not asking every college bound male to give it up in high school for us<br />\nwomen. I can appreciate a virgin. After all, I will never<br />\ncast my pearls before swine either. Yet in a rush to<br />\nfulfill the macho image instead of just pretending, a<br />\nHopkins male will do just that.<br />\n* * *<br />\nI think the guys here at Hopkins are really good<br />\nlooking. There are quite a few serious bods around.<br />\nBut have you ever noticed that they all have the worst<br />\ntaste in women. I have seen hunks going out with the<br />\nugliest pigs on campus.\"Maybe she gives good head\",<br />\nmy roommate says. Or \"Pussy has no face\". Shit,<br />\nturning the lights off isn't good enough for me; I can<br />\nfeel and smell ugly. And people see you walking<br />\naround with that thing. They stare at you.

Of course to ge<br />\nan education that will hopefully enable us to assume<br />\na professional or prestigious career. For many of us<br />\nthat includes making a lot of money. Then one may<br />\nask what is the importance or significance of this<br />\nprestige or wealth? The answer is obvious: sex. Class<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nIn my career at Hopkins, I have met many rude men<br />\nand I've met a lot of boring men, but I've also found<br />\nsome truly good male friends. I adopted the policy<br />\nfreshman year: when/if you meet a guy that knows<br />\nsomething more than the MSE hours or the current<br />\nspecial at Eddies, hang onto him\u2014you've found someone different. It paid off in the end. After years of<br />\npatience, I find myself with a few men that have made<br />\nbeing at Hopkins a good and memorable experience.<br />\nDon't laugh, it's true!

First, it is<br />\ncinematographically beautiful.<br />\nI suppose it isn't difficult ot<br />\nfind pretty camera work in<br />\nAlaska, but in Never Cry Wolf,<br />\neven the indoor photography is<br />\ngood. Unlike most movies that<br />\nare \"beautiful\", Never Cry<br />\nWolf isn't boring.<br />\nNever Cry Wolf is about a<br />\nnaturalist, Tyler (Charles Martin Smith), who is looking for<br />\nan adventure. He volunteers to<br />\ntrack a pack of Arctic wolves<br />\nfor the government, which<br />\nbelieves that wolves are responsible for the decimation of the<br />\ncaribou. He is dropped in the<br />\nmiddle of the Alaskan mountains in late winter with a<br />\ncanoe, ten crates of supplies,<br />\nand his base oboe, which he intends to play for the wolves. He<br />\nestablishes \"Lupus Base One\"<br />\noutside a den inhabited by two<br />\nhandsome Arctic wolves, whom<br />\nhe names George and Angie,<br />\nand their pups, who are not appallingly cute. I was impressed<br />\nby the fact that the movie never<br />\ntries to make the animals seem<br /><br />\ncute or \"human\", which is<br />\nespecially surprising considering this is a Disney movie.<br />\nTyler becomes convinced<br />\nthat the wolves are not killing<br />\nmany caribou and in fact live<br />\nlargely on field mice. There is<br />\na very funny sequence when<br />\nTyler decides to prove that a<br />\nlarge mammal can live on field<br />\nmice, using himself as the test<br />\nanimal. He sets an elegant<br />\ntable, the best silver and china,<br />\na carafe of moose-juice(a blend<br />\nof Moosehead beer and grain<br />\nalcohol), and a tureen of mouse<br />\nstew. Later he becomes even<br />\nmore of a gourmet, preparing<br />\nfor himself such delicacies as<br />\nmouse brochette, mouse-on-aritz, and mouse au vin.<br />\nThe movie doesn't really go<br />\nanywhere. Tyler convinces<br />\nhimself that the wolves are only eating the sick caribou,<br />\nthough he doesn't think he will<br />\nbe able to convince the government. It doesn't really matter<br />\nthough, because in a little while<br />\nthe area will probably be<br />\nbulldozed and paved over by<br />\ncorrupt Man, typified by the<br />\nvicious pilot, Rosie (played with<br />\nambiguous malice by Brian<br />\nDennehy). Eventually, Tyler<br />\nwanders off with Unuk, a Inoit<br />\n(Eskimo) who saved his life early during the winter.<br /><br />\nThere are serious problems<br />\nwith the movie. It is a Walt<br />\nDisney release, and has an old<br />\nWalt Disney plot: a man of<br />\ncivilization becomes a part of<br />\nthe wilderness. The voice-over<br />\nnarration is atrocious; it makes<br />\nTyler, who acts intelligent,<br />\nsound like a fool, and doesn't<br />\nhelp the movie along at all. No<br />\nfewer than three writers pooled their incompetence to write<br />\nthe narration, and whatever effort they might have put into it<br />\ndoesn't show.<br />\nSometimes the movie takes<br />\nitself too seriously: dream sequences, mysterious black<br />\nwolves, ancient Indian legends,<br />\nthe kind of stuff that makes<br />\nbad movies really bad, all<br />\nweaken this good movie. Some<br />\nof Tyler's discussions with the<br />\nold Inoit (\"The wolf, it is my<br />\nguardian spirit\") are ridiculous<br />\nbecause the audience is supposed to believe this garbage.<br />\nPerhaps some people do accept<br />\nhokiness as authenticity; I just<br />\nforgave it on the grounds that<br />\nthere were so many other things<br />\nabout the movie that were<br />\nlikeable and authentic.<br />\nNever Cry Wolf is playing at<br />\nthe Rotunda ($2 student admission, Monday through Thursday) and I definitely recommend you go see it.<br /><br />\nStar 80<br />\nby Dan Vitale<br /><br />\nthe importance of appearances<br /><br />\nFor a movie based on a true<br />\nstory, Star 80 is unnervingly<br />\nfalse-hearted. Using almost<br />\nevery garish cinematic trick in<br />\nthe book, writer-director Bob<br />\nFosse turns the murder of<br />\nPlayboy model Dorothy Stratten into lurid trash even as he<br />\nattempts to condemn the kind<br />\nof trashy culture in which such<br />\nmurders occur. Fosse's telling<br />\nAmerica to stop picking its<br />\nnose, but he's got snot under<br />\nhis own fingernails and he<br />\ndoesn't seem to know it.<br />\nStratten was killed in August<br />\n1980 by her husband and<br />\nmanager, Paul Snider, who<br />\ndiscovered her in a Vancouver<br />\nDairy Queen, got her into Hugh<br />\nHefner's mansion as well as his<br />\nmagazine, and then watched as<br />\nshe began to leave him behind:<br />\nbecoming 1980's Playmate of<br />\nthe Year, embarking on a<br /><br />\nbacks up on him in ways he's<br />\nembarrassingly unaware of.<br />\nAs Stratten, Marie! Hemingway is a cipher, as much of<br />\na nonperson as the women who<br />\nappear in Playboy, in spite of<br />\nthe fact that she walks, talks,<br />\nand has affairs. It's hard to tell<br />\nif this is Hemingway's or<br />\nFosse's fault: the screenplay<br />\ngives us very little of her<br />\ncharacter. Granted, vacant innocence is difficult to portray<br />\nonscreen, but even when<br />\nDorothy starts making decisions on her own we are<br />\nmystified about her motives.<br />\nThe scenes in which she<br />\ngradually matures beyond<br />\nSnider's control would be effective only if we knew why she<br />\nfelt drawn to him in the first<br />\nplace. The movie seems incapable of showing us conscious, rational thought on<br />\nStratten's part.<br /><br />\nPlay: Same Time Next Year<br />\nby Charlie Scharf<br />\nThe Spotlighters Theatre has<br />\nbrought a wonderful presentation of Bernard Slade's comedy<br />\nSame Time Next Year to the<br />\nBaltimore stage. The play,<br />\nwhich opened February 3, stars<br />\nHarry Turner and Sallie Rixie<br />\nas George and Doris, two<br />\ncharacters who have a once a<br />\nyear love affair.<br />\nThe play is divided into<br />\nscenes which usually occur at<br />\nfive year intervals, thus enabling the audience to observe the<br />\nchanges in lifestyles that these<br />\ncharacters undergo. The<br />\ncharacters change with the<br />\ntimes; Doris evolves from a<br />\nhigh school dropout through a<br />\nsixties hippie into a woman of<br />\nhigh society. George's life<br />\nparallels Doris': as the play<br />\nopens, he seems insecure and<br />\nbumbling, but by the play's<br />\nend, he has becom a self confident businessman.<br />\nThe play begins with the couple waking the morning after<br />\ntheir first encounter. George<br />\ndoesn't even know Doris'<br />\nname, but the two seem to find<br />\na mutual attraction and they<br />\ncontinue to meet the same<br />\nweekend each year at the same<br />\nbungalow. The only hitch in<br />\nthis cozy arrangement is that<br />\nboth Doris and George are<br />\nmarried, to other people.<br />\nThe script is filled with one<br /><br />\nliners and they are indeed funny.

Turner proved himself<br />\nto be obviously experienced and<br />\nvery flexible as an actor. As an<br />\ninsecure accountant, Turner<br />\ndisplays nervousness and tension in an extremely realistic<br />\nmanner. His portrayal of the<br />\nolder, more self-confident<br />\nbusinessman was equally as<br />\nbelievable, illustrating the range<br />\nof his acting ability.

This helps the audience draw into the scene and<br />\ncomplements the intimate<br />\nmood of the play.<br /><br />\nNonetheless, this setting<br />\nseemed to present a challenge<br />\nfor the actors. Owing to the<br />\nproximity of the audience, the<br />\nactors' every gesture was<br />\navailable for scrutiny, but they<br />\nintimacy<br />\nthis<br />\nhandled<br />\nreasonably well.<br />\nTurner was also the cod i rector, but his directing was<br />\novershadowed by his fine acting.

Until now, they<br />\nhave been close, but still,<br />\nsomething is lacking.<br />\nWhile the team sports a 12-3<br />\nrecord, Hopkins' lackluster<br />\nperformance of late has Coach<br />\nRichard Oles alarmed. The<br />\ncoach is concerned that many<br />\nof the fencers are still making<br />\nmistakes they made at the start<br />\nof the season, even after working on them in practice.<br />\nThrough the use of videotape<br />\nas well as personal critiques of<br />\neach fencer by the coach, the<br />\nBlue Jays hope to work out the<br />\nflaws in their game and take the<br />\nconference championships. As<br />\nof this week, it has been a slow<br />\nprocess with fewer results than<br />\nthe coach would like to see.<br />\nThis past weekend was a<br />\nperfect example. The team won<br />\na thriller against Duke University on Friday, with the contest<br />\ngoing down to the last bout, a<br />\n5-4 win by Andy Goldberg.<br />\nScoring points in the Shaffer<br />\nplayer-of-the-year award were<br />\ncaptains Taro Adachi and<br />\nDavid Wiener with 3-0 performances.

The sabre fell apart in<br />\nthis one and everyone fell down<br />\nin pressure situations.\"<br />\nHopkins got tough in the second meet against Stevens Tech<br />\nof Hoboken(!), N.J.

Still the Coach is<br />\nquick to point out that two of<br />\nthe three defeats were at the<br />\nhands of MAC members.<br /><br />\nFor the next two weeks the<br />\nteam will be concentrating on<br />\nconsistency, something even the<br />\nbest fencers have lacked at<br />\ntimes.

He's become only the fifth<br />\nmajor college coach to record<br />\nmore than 700 career victories,<br />\nand if he takes DePaul to the<br />\nFinal Four in Seattle, they've<br />\ngot to be the sentimental<br />\nfavorite.<br />\nBut no matter where Ray<br />\nMeyer finishes, he's a<br />\nwinner\u2014first class, a Park<br />\nAvenue person with class and<br />\nthoroughbred manners\u2014a<br />\ngentleman. le a career as both<br />\nplayer and coach that has<br />\nspanned six decades, he can be<br />\njustly proud.<br />\nSo let's give him his due now,<br />\nthis Frank Skeffington of the<br />\nHardwood. It's his last hurrah.<br />\nIt's only too bad Spencer Tracy<br />\ncan't be around to do his life<br />\nstory, after the crepe paper sags<br />\nand the last blue and white confetti of the season is swept<br />\naway.<br />\nRay Meyer is truly the elder<br />\nstatesman of basketball, the last<br />\ncoach to remember black high<br />\ntop sneakers, knee pads,<br />\nwooden blackboards, and<br />\ngames on black-and -white TV.<br />\nHe did not invent the sport of<br />\nbasketball, but when Dr.<br />\nNaismith was putting up the<br />\npeach basket, Ray Meyer was<br />\nholding the ladder.<br />\nHe is truly the last of the<br />\nMohicans, because it is a rare<br />\nbreed of cat who can still control the whistle and clipboard in<br />\nthe heavyweight division long<br />\nafter most coaches have accepted the gold watch and<br />\ncaught the train to Sun City.<br />\nThe pressures Ray Meyer has<br />\nwithstood are tremendous.<br />\nMost coaches are taking early<br />\nleave or being pushed out in<br />\ntheir 30's, or being burnt in effigy in their 40's, or after one<br />\nwinning season in their 50's,<br />\nretire and live off that. In their<br />\n60's, there aren't any around<br />\ndown in the pit\u2014and Ray<br />\nMeyer is 70.<br />\nHe's still going through what<br />\nRich Najerus is going through<br />\nat Marquette, what Bobby<br />\nKnight is going through at Indiana, what Dean Smith is going through at North Carolina,<br /><br />\nand what Ralph Miller is going<br />\nthrough at Oregon State. It's<br />\njust that Rick is in his 30's,<br />\nBobby Knight in his 50's, and<br />\nRalph Miller in his 60's\u2014and<br />\nRay Meyer is 70.<br />\nCoach Meyer is a rare and<br />\nunique man, who has lived his<br />\nwhole life by a simple code of<br />\nvalues. He's had only one<br />\nhouse, one wife, and one job.<br />\nHe's an old-neighborhood<br />\nman, houses with stoops,<br />\nmilkmen putting bottles on the<br />\nfront porch, Ed Sullivan on<br />\nSunday nights, a family man<br />\nwho attends every wake.<br />\nWhat makes Ray special is<br />\nthat he has super-exceeded the<br />\ncoaching image on a novenaand-rosary budget, and never<br />\ngot involved in the rush-tobank philosophy of coaching.<br />\nHe still does the father-son,<br />\nMoose, Eagle, Elk, Boy Scouts,<br />\nUnited Way, you name it. He's<br />\na soft touch that way, and these<br />\ngroups know when in doubt,<br />\ncall Ray. He'll do what has to<br />\nbe done, no fee.<br />\nHe is the most recognizable<br />\nfigure in the game today. When<br />\nyou say \"coach\" in Chicago, it<br />\nmeans Ray Meyer, not the guy<br />\nat Northwestern or Notre Dame<br />\nor chicago Circle. Ask a cabbie:<br />\n\"You think Coach can make<br />\nthe Final Four?\" He'll start<br />\ntalking about DePaul. Saying<br />\ncoach in Chicago is like saying,<br />\nWilt, Bird, Magic. There's only one person that comes to<br />\nmind.<br />\nRay's teams were always<br />\nprepared and, above all, his<br />\nplayers were taught how to lose<br />\nwith dignity and win with<br />\nhumility. The familiar picture<br />\nof Ray after a game, hitching<br />\nup his belt before he met the<br />\npress, either to take the blame<br /><br />\nfor his team's losses or to praise<br />\nhis players for a winning performance, will stay with us<br />\nforever.<br />\nIt's easy to be graceful when<br />\nyou win. I've seen Ray in heartbreak losses, where he never<br />\nrefused to come on TV, even<br />\nthough maybe his number one<br />\nranked team had just been<br />\nknocked out of the tournament<br />\nby St. Joseph's. It was a terrible blow, but Ray handled it<br />\nwith grace. He has that dignr<br />\nty, that way about him, we shall<br />\nnever see again.<br />\nWhen I was at Marquette<br />\nand we coached against each<br />\nother, we were great friends.<br />\nBut for two hours twice a year,<br />\nwe put on different hats, our<br />\ngame faces, and went at it. We<br />\nboth had a style of yelling at the<br />\nballplayers. At the half, our<br />\nlockers were next to each other.<br />\nSo Ray would yell a while, then<br />\nI'd yell a while.<br />\nI remember his great sense of<br />\nhumor. When we played in the<br />\nOld DePaul gym, the<br />\nwashroom was between both<br />\nteams' locker rooms. Once, I<br />\nwas doing my pre-game radio<br />\nshow with Tom Collins, and in<br />\nthe middle of the taping, Ray<br />\nwalked in and flushed all the<br />\njohns. That ended the interview<br />\nquick.<br />\nCoach Meyer has won every<br />\nmajor award. In 1978, he was<br />\nnamed Coach of the Year by<br />\nthe US Basketball Writers<br />\nAssociation, and he was inducted into the Naismith Hall<br />\nof Fame in 1979. That same<br />\nyear, he was named Chicagoan<br />\nof the Year by the Chicago<br />\nPress Club. He took his team to<br />\nthe NCAA Final Four in 1979,<br />\nand to the NIT Finals in 1983.<br />\nNext year, Coach Meyer<br />\npasses on the baton to his son<br />\nJoey, who has been his top<br />\nassistant for 10 years, patient<br />\nand well-schooled. So this year,<br />\nwherever his team plays, you<br />\nshould go see him. Take your<br />\nchildren and say, \"There is a<br />\nman who has stood the test of<br />\ntime and has been a credit to a<br />\nprofession that has few lasting<br />\nidols.\"<br />\nAs you watch him, try to<br />\ntake a mind's eye picture.
