These are the Civil Engineering Building, the Johns Hopkins Club and the Student Activities Building.<br />\nThe Civil Engineering Building<br />\ncovers a total area of 14,340<br />\nsquare feet. The building is 204<br />\nfeet in length and comprises three<br />\nstories, in addition to the basement. It has been planned so<br />\nthat at any future time an extensive addition may be made to<br />\nthe westward to accommodate<br />\neither another branch of engineering or to take care of the growth<br />\nof the work in the present department.<br />\nIn the basement, three large<br />\nlaboratories are located\u2014one each<br />\nfor the three divisions into which<br />\nthe work of instruction and re\u2022 search in civil engineering is divided. In the central portion of<br />\nthe building, in the west wing, is<br />\nthe main laboratory, comprising<br />\na large room, together milli a research room, devoted to investigation work and laboratory Instruction.<br />\nOn either side of the main<br />\nentrance of the building are offi\u2022ces opening out of the corridor<br />\nand directly across the corridor<br />\nis the main lecture-room\u2014the<br />\nlargest in the University, by the<br />\nway\u2014giving room for seating an<br />\naudience of 350 to 400 persons.<br />\nThe unique feature of the lectureroom, however, is a specially fireproof addition adjoining the lecture-room on the west, which will<br />\nbe used for the operating of a<br />\nmoving-picture machine.<br />\nThe Civil Engineering Building<br />\nis similar in style of architecture<br />\nto the Mechanical and Electrical<br />\nEngineering Building. Prof. C.<br />\nJ. Tilden, head of the department, had the three types of construction\u2014the pure tile arch ceiling without reinforcement, the reinforced concrete and the steel<br />\nconstruction\u2014used in making a<br />\npart of the building, in order to<br />\nbe able to show the student engineer an actual representation of<br />\neach of these different methods.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Club will<br />\nbe located at Homewood in the<br />\nold Carroll Mansion at the entrance to the academic grounds.<br />\nAt the present time this building<br />\nis being renovated to meet the<br />\nelaborate plans for a new clubhouse at a cost of $9,000. It is ex-<br />\n<br />\nThe opening of Johns Hopkins<br />\nat Homewood brings with it the<br />\nlargest freshman enrollment in<br />\nthe history of the University.<br />\nThere are 170 men in the Class<br />\nof 1920; there are 100 men in the<br />\nacademic department alone,an<br />\nincrease of 40 over last year's enrollment. This is the first time<br />\nin two years that the academic<br />\nmen have outnumbered the engineers.<br />\nAt piesent the removal of the<br />\nUniversity from the old site has<br />\nbeen practically completed, only<br />\nthe chemistry library and laboratory and the astronomical laboratory remaining in the Howard<br />\nstreet buildings. All the academic departments are housed in<br />\nthe large Academic Building,<br />\nwhereas the engineering courses<br />\nare held in the Electrical and<br />\nCivil Engineering Buildings. The<br />\ncost of moving to Homewood was<br />\nabout $30,000.<br />\nThe Academic Building also<br />\ncontains the president's, dean's,<br />\nregistrar's and treasurer's offices<br />\nand the postoffice. This arrangement is a great improvement over<br />\nthe old one, where the treasurer<br />\nwas housed on Howard street,<br />\nseveral squares from McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe Homewood library has attracted nation-wide attention. The<br />\nfact that all department libraries<br />\nadjoin the various classrooms and<br />\noffices, and the beauty and comfort of the reading-room, combine<br />\nto make a system unsurpassed in<br />\nany college building. The large<br />\nroom immediately below the reading-room has been named the<br />\nDonovan Room \u2014 a reminiscence<br />\nof McCoy Hall\u2014in honor of Miss<br />\nCarolyn Donovan, who endowed a<br />\nprofessorship of English.<br />\nThe laboratories are at present<br />\nsomewhat crowded, but in the<br />\ncourse of a few weeks will become more adjusted to the new<br />\nconditions. By that time, likewise, the additional lockers necessary to accommodate all the students will probably be installed.<br />\n<br />\nOn Saturday the University<br />\nfootball team opened its season at<br />\nHomewood with Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nCollege and acquitted itself in a<br />\nfairly creditable manner. I say,<br />\n\"fairly creditable\" because in the<br />\nfirst half of the game the team<br />\nacted as though they had just assembled for the first day's practice and. seemed bent on doing<br />\nwhat they had been tutored not to<br />\ndo. Some.excuse for this rests on<br />\nthe fact that the rush line is practically absolutely new; the units<br />\nhave not as yet played enough together to present any degree of<br />\nsolidarity. Twenty-four minutes<br />\nof actual playing worked wonders<br />\nin this direction, so that in the<br />\nsecond half the line played in a<br />\nmanner that at least indicated<br />\nthat they were realizing what the<br />\ncoaches have been trying to instil<br />\ninto them. The back field, having<br />\nplayed together to a greater extent than the line, for Branham,<br />\nBrooks, and Darley have had such<br />\nprevious experience, gave a better<br />\naccount of itself throughout the<br />\ngame. Therefore, the men who<br />\nbore the burden and heat of the<br />\nday, and the latter was the greater task, deserve credit..<br />\nThe game disclosed what the<br />\ncoaches have only 'too full well<br />\nappreciated, namely, that we need<br />\nmore candidates endowed with<br />\ngreater physical strength than the<br />\nsquad now possesses. Saturday<br />\nwe were opposed by a team which<br />\ndoes not at all compare with the<br />\nopposition which we -fire bound,<br />\nfrom now on, to encounter; yet,<br />\n\u2022 its line was able, at times, to outplay ours, and this despite the<br />\nfact that our line had a most simple attack to cope with, as there<br />\nwere no complex formations to<br />\nbewilder the defense, nor was there<br />\nany \"shuttling\" of the back-field,<br />\nwhich in early games is apt to send<br />\npart of the defense forward rainbow chasing. It is devoutly hoped<br />\nthat some of the heavy men from<br />\nthe Medical School will present<br />\nthemselves this week. McKeithen,<br />\nPunk and Freedom did the best<br />\nline work, while Gorman did<br />\nmighty well in his down-field<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe, backfield, as individuals,<br />\ndid good work, for Brooks, Branham and Uhler lived up to expecta tions.

The result<br />\nof this was the building of the<br />\npresent courts. Six were constructed \u2014 four of cinder, which<br />\nwere very hard to keep in condition, and two of grass, which<br />\ncould not be kept in, shape at all,<br />\nand which were soon done away<br />\nwith. In a year's time a movement was started to secure clay<br />\ncourts. This was continued last<br />\nyear and led to the agreement between the students and the Athletic Association by which if $150<br />\nwas raised by the students the<br />\nAthletic Association would give<br />\n$500. After a campaign conducted by Albert Hammond and Walter Taylor, the manager and the<br />\ncaptain, respectively, and the<br />\nother members of the tennis team,<br />\nthe money was raised but, although the members of the Athletic Association were almost<br />\nunanimous in favor of granting,<br />\nthe remaining $500, it was suggested that all the money made by<br />\nthe Association during the year<br />\nshould be turned over to the University, and that the trustees of<br />\nthe University would probably<br />\nmake the necessary grant to the<br />\ntennis team.<br />\nThe surplus was given over, but<br />\nthe trustees did not at that time<br />\nsee their way clear to furnish the<br />\nfunds for courts.<br />\nThe matter is now in the hands<br />\nof the Association.

It has been rumored<br />\nthat J. Trueman Thompson, the<br />\npresent editor of the book, has decided upon his resignation. When<br />\nasked if there was any foundation to the report, Mr. Thompson<br />\nadmitted that he was considering<br />\nthe matter very seriously.<br />\nMr. Thompson has started a<br />\nstore in the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding for the furnishing of<br />\ntechnical supplies to the engineering students, and he feels that<br />\nthe amount of time required for the<br />\nmanagement of his investment will<br />\nprevent him from giving the time<br />\nto the editing of the \"Hullabaloo,\"<br />\nwhich the task requires. Rather<br />\nthan slight the book in any way,<br />\nlie thinks that a man who has<br />\nmore time to give should be elected in his place.<br />\nMr. Thompson is an Omicron<br />\nDelta Kappa man, and, in the<br />\nplans made last year, had already<br />\ndemonstrated his ability as an<br />\neditor. His resignation, if offered,<br />\nwill, be keenly felt.<br />\n<br />\nPlans for the new School of<br />\nHygiene and Public Health to be<br />\nestablished and maintained at<br />\nJohns Hopkins by the Rockefeller<br />\nfoundation are now thoroughly<br />\nmatured. Dr. William H. Welch,<br />\nthe director of the new School of<br />\nHygiene, returned last week from<br />\nEurope where since August 7 he<br />\nhas been investigating institutions<br />\nof similar purpose.<br />\nThe central and principal feature of the school, as Doctor<br />\nWelch has pointed out, will be an<br />\ninstitute of hygiene, housed in its<br />\nown building, provided with the<br />\nrequisite laboratories and facilities and its own staff of teachers,<br />\ngiving their entire time to the<br />\nwork of teaching and investigating.<br />\nInasmuch as the profession of<br />\nthe sanitarian and worker in public health, although closely connected is not identical with that<br />\nof the practitioner of medicine,<br />\nthe School of Hygiene and Public<br />\nHealth, while working in co-operation with the medical school, as<br />\nwell as with the School of Engineering, will have an independent existence under the University.

Royal Club.<br />\nParticipation in these local affairs, it was decided, would greatly add to the interest in shooting,<br />\nand in addition, would give the<br />\nmen more practice for the intercollegiate matches which are to<br />\nbegin about January 1.

There is all<br />\nready evidence that this institution will become one of the leading<br />\nuniversities of the country and the<br />\ninaugural of the scholastic term<br />\nat the new location should not<br />\n\u2022<br />\nwithout generous accord of<br />\ncommendation to the promoters of<br />\nthis change who have toiled unceasingly to bring about the passing of the University from North<br />\n'Howard street to Homewood. In<br />\nfact, there should be some public<br />\nacknowledgment of this most important event so that honest tribute can be paid the institution,<br />\nthe faculty and the, directors.<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is<br />\ncoining into its own. There is<br />\nsomething analogous between its<br />\nstanding and that of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, which latter<br />\ninstitution was better known in<br />\nEurope 10 years ago than it<br />\nwas at home. Today the hospital is acclaimed by Baltimoreans as the greatest institution of its kind iii the country<br />\nand a most valuable asset to the<br />\ncity. Cooped up in the inadeqiiate HOward street buildings,<br />\nthe University has not been appreciated, but with the Homewood<br />\nexpansion, Baltimore and a nation of people are beginning to understand the wonderful prospects<br />\nof the institution.<br />\nConditions at Homewood are<br />\nideal for the making of one of the<br />\nmost important universities in the<br />\ncountry. Situated in the heart of<br />\none of the best residential sections<br />\nof the city, there is no danger of<br />\nconflicting encroachment. Both<br />\nthe site and the architectural<br />\ncharacter of the buildings are appealing and, there is ample room<br />\nfor the expansion, which must result from the speedy recognition<br />\nof the university facilities, both<br />\nscholastic and athletic.<br />\nWhen it is considered that Harvard, Yale or Princeton in their<br />\nbroken combination of buildings<br />\nwould give much for a composite<br />\nuniversity, then the present fortune of Johns Hopkins at Homewood can be understood. These<br />\nlarger institutions cannot be uprooted from their established locations without considerable expense and harmful traditionary<br />\nresults. Johns Hopkins is an old<br />\ninstitution, but the inadequateness of the old site has been so<br />\ngenerally recognized that the effect will be decidedly rejuvenating<br />\nrather than harmful. In this respect Johns Hopkins has a material advantage over other institutions of learning and it is not<br />\nsurprising that optimistic predictions are being made regarding<br />\nthe future of thelThiversily.<br />\n<br />\n[From the Baltimore News.]<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWith the practical closing of<br />\nthe European universities, particularly of the German universities, it was reasonable to suppose<br />\nthat many of the students from<br />\nJapan and the Latin-American republics, from China and other<br />\ncountries, who, in normal times,<br />\nwould have sought these institutions, would turn to American<br />\ntemples of learning. Before the<br />\nwar, to be sure, we were by no<br />\nmeans without our students from<br />\nabroad; but, now their numbers<br />\nhave increased so greatly that it is<br />\nonly possible to ascribe the influx<br />\nto the shutting off of European<br />\nsources of instruction. In Baltimore, it seems, about 30 Oriental<br />\nstudents, several times as many as<br />\nusual, will take -up post-graduate<br />\nstudies this scholastic year.<br />\nIn the matter of serious postgraduate work, of course, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University has at\u2022 tained international prestige. The<br />\nMedical School, for one thing, is<br />\nrenowned wherever men of science<br />\nassemble. Baltimoreans know as<br />\nmuch in a general way, but it is<br />\ndoubtful whether they sufficiently<br />\noften stop to think and by thinking to appreciate the distinction<br />\nwhich the Hopkins confers upon<br />\nthe city. To find foreign students<br />\nturning here in stick increasing<br />\nnumbers is gratifying. It is to be<br />\nhoped that after the war their<br />\nnumber will not wane, but will<br />\ncontinue to increase. And, so far<br />\nas the Hopkins is'concerned, it is<br />\nequally to be hoped that development will continue along the lines<br />\nlaid down by its organizers and<br />\nalong which it has already<br />\nachieved such fame and notable<br />\nresults\u2014university work in its<br />\ntrue sense.<br />\n\"Were you copying his notes?\"<br />\n\"Oh no, sir!

He was not only<br />\npainstaking and thorough, but in<br />\nin an unusual degree he was original. His research work was in a<br />\ndifficult field, involving a theoretical and practical inquiry into<br />\nthe fixation of wages in transportation. His reports to the Seminary were rather longer than<br />\nmost, and exhibited a diligence in<br />\nthe survey of material and a<br />\nchoiceness of expression that are<br />\nthe marks of finished scholarship.<br />\nEvery one felt that he had spent<br />\nupon his work many hours in addition to what ordinary standards would require. Not infrequently the nature of the study<br />\nand the fullness of the material<br />\nhe brought to light prompted him<br />\nto corrections and amendments<br />\nof foregoing writers that would<br />\nhave seemed presumptuous in one<br />\nof less integrity as a student. It<br />\nwas particularly his dissertation<br />\nthat attracted the economic department of Dartmouth College<br />\nto him; the field before him was<br />\nrich in possibilities, after the<br />\npromising beginning which he had<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nHe was intensely liked by every<br />\nmember of the Seminary for his<br />\nPersonal qualities. Courtesy and<br />\ncordiality that sprang from the<br />\nheart and deepest nature marked<br />\nhis whole intercourse with his<br />\nfellow-students. A sunny geniality went out from him, and compelled friendship. He was a person to draw you into pleasant conversations; how many little episodes in which he figured come<br />\ncrowding back upon those who<br />\nknew him well or slightly!<br />\nNoble Stockett did much to add<br />\nzest to the department.

In<br />\nthe following article he explains the purpose and the nature of the military<br />\nwork which will be conducted at this<br />\nUniversity.<br />\n<br />\nIn introducing military training, Johns Hopkins is following<br />\nthe lead of nearly all the great<br />\neducational institutions throughout the, country today. The lessons of the great . war have<br />\nbrought home to the thinking people of the country the .vital importance of a better preparation<br />\nfor the day when. America, however unwilling, may be drawn into<br />\na similar struggle.<br />\nAmerican armies will, in all<br />\nprobability, be armies of volunteers and to command and drill<br />\nthe many thousands of willing<br />\nand patriotic, but ignorant and<br />\nuntrained masses of men, a large<br />\nnumber of officers will be required. Our small regular army<br />\ncan furnish only a very few of<br />\nthose needed. On it will fall the<br />\nburden of withstanding the first<br />\nonslaught of the enemy and most<br />\nof its personnel cannot be spared<br />\nfrom their posts.<br />\nThe new legislation recently<br />\npassed by Congress attempts to<br />\nprovide, for these deficiencies by<br />\ntraining reserve officers men who<br />\nwill be sufficiently schooled in<br />\nmilitary work to step from civil<br />\nlife into the ranks and at once<br />\ncommand and instruct volunteers.<br />\nThe training and instruction of<br />\nthese reserve officers is to take<br />\nplace at the various colleges and<br />\nuniversities of the country, and<br />\nhere at Hopkins we are to organize this week a unit to be known<br />\nas The Reserve Officers' Training<br />\nCorps, Johns Hopkins University.<br />\n,The course of training will extend over two years and students<br />\nwho, have covered the course and<br />\nare recomniended by those in<br />\ncharge of the work will receive<br />\nfrom the War Department commissions in the Regular Army Reserve. While possibly only a limited number of _those who undergo<br />\nthe training will be found fitted<br />\nto accept these commissions, one<br />\nand all will benefit physically<br />\nand mentally by the lessons in<br />\ndiscipline, co-ordination and teamwork, which are the essence of<br />\nmilitary training.

The kicking<br />\nwas of a very poor order and this<br />\nfor divers reasons\u2014aoilnan has<br />\nhad no training in kicking behind<br />\na rush line; his kicks were hurried because of the poor work of<br />\nthe line in checking, and he wak<br />\nmade apprehensive because of several poor passes from center. On<br />\nthe whole, considering the conditions under which he worked, he<br />\nacquitted himself as well as one<br />\ncould expect.<br />\nThese criticisms may seem a bit<br />\nharsh, but the University has a<br />\nright to know the true condition<br />\nof the team.

These are the Civil Engineering Building, the Johns Hopkins Club and the Student Activities Building.<br />\nThe Civil Engineering Building<br />\ncovers a total area of 14,340<br />\nsquare feet. The building is 204<br />\nfeet in length and comprises three<br />\nstories, in addition to the basement. It has been planned so<br />\nthat at any future time an extensive addition may be made to<br />\nthe westward to accommodate<br />\neither another branch of engineering or to take care of the growth<br />\nof the work in the present department.<br />\nIn the basement, three large<br />\nlaboratories are located\u2014one each<br />\nfor the three divisions into which<br />\nthe work of instruction and re\u2022 search in civil engineering is divided. In the central portion of<br />\nthe building, in the west wing, is<br />\nthe main laboratory, comprising<br />\na large room, together milli a research room, devoted to investigation work and laboratory Instruction.<br />\nOn either side of the main<br />\nentrance of the building are offi\u2022ces opening out of the corridor<br />\nand directly across the corridor<br />\nis the main lecture-room\u2014the<br />\nlargest in the University, by the<br />\nway\u2014giving room for seating an<br />\naudience of 350 to 400 persons.<br />\nThe unique feature of the lectureroom, however, is a specially fireproof addition adjoining the lecture-room on the west, which will<br />\nbe used for the operating of a<br />\nmoving-picture machine.<br />\nThe Civil Engineering Building<br />\nis similar in style of architecture<br />\nto the Mechanical and Electrical<br />\nEngineering Building. Prof. C.<br />\nJ. Tilden, head of the department, had the three types of construction\u2014the pure tile arch ceiling without reinforcement, the reinforced concrete and the steel<br />\nconstruction\u2014used in making a<br />\npart of the building, in order to<br />\nbe able to show the student engineer an actual representation of<br />\neach of these different methods.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins Club will<br />\nbe located at Homewood in the<br />\nold Carroll Mansion at the entrance to the academic grounds.<br />\nAt the present time this building<br />\nis being renovated to meet the<br />\nelaborate plans for a new clubhouse at a cost of $9,000. It is ex-<br /><br />\nThe opening of Johns Hopkins<br />\nat Homewood brings with it the<br />\nlargest freshman enrollment in<br />\nthe history of the University.<br />\nThere are 170 men in the Class<br />\nof 1920; there are 100 men in the<br />\nacademic department alone,an<br />\nincrease of 40 over last year's enrollment. This is the first time<br />\nin two years that the academic<br />\nmen have outnumbered the engineers.<br />\nAt piesent the removal of the<br />\nUniversity from the old site has<br />\nbeen practically completed, only<br />\nthe chemistry library and laboratory and the astronomical laboratory remaining in the Howard<br />\nstreet buildings. All the academic departments are housed in<br />\nthe large Academic Building,<br />\nwhereas the engineering courses<br />\nare held in the Electrical and<br />\nCivil Engineering Buildings. The<br />\ncost of moving to Homewood was<br />\nabout $30,000.<br />\nThe Academic Building also<br />\ncontains the president's, dean's,<br />\nregistrar's and treasurer's offices<br />\nand the postoffice. This arrangement is a great improvement over<br />\nthe old one, where the treasurer<br />\nwas housed on Howard street,<br />\nseveral squares from McCoy Hall.<br />\nThe Homewood library has attracted nation-wide attention. The<br />\nfact that all department libraries<br />\nadjoin the various classrooms and<br />\noffices, and the beauty and comfort of the reading-room, combine<br />\nto make a system unsurpassed in<br />\nany college building. The large<br />\nroom immediately below the reading-room has been named the<br />\nDonovan Room \u2014 a reminiscence<br />\nof McCoy Hall\u2014in honor of Miss<br />\nCarolyn Donovan, who endowed a<br />\nprofessorship of English.<br />\nThe laboratories are at present<br />\nsomewhat crowded, but in the<br />\ncourse of a few weeks will become more adjusted to the new<br />\nconditions. By that time, likewise, the additional lockers necessary to accommodate all the students will probably be installed.<br /><br />\nOn Saturday the University<br />\nfootball team opened its season at<br />\nHomewood with Mt. St. Mary's<br />\nCollege and acquitted itself in a<br />\nfairly creditable manner. I say,<br />\n\"fairly creditable\" because in the<br />\nfirst half of the game the team<br />\nacted as though they had just assembled for the first day's practice and. seemed bent on doing<br />\nwhat they had been tutored not to<br />\ndo. Some.excuse for this rests on<br />\nthe fact that the rush line is practically absolutely new; the units<br />\nhave not as yet played enough together to present any degree of<br />\nsolidarity. Twenty-four minutes<br />\nof actual playing worked wonders<br />\nin this direction, so that in the<br />\nsecond half the line played in a<br />\nmanner that at least indicated<br />\nthat they were realizing what the<br />\ncoaches have been trying to instil<br />\ninto them. The back field, having<br />\nplayed together to a greater extent than the line, for Branham,<br />\nBrooks, and Darley have had such<br />\nprevious experience, gave a better<br />\naccount of itself throughout the<br />\ngame. Therefore, the men who<br />\nbore the burden and heat of the<br />\nday, and the latter was the greater task, deserve credit..<br />\nThe game disclosed what the<br />\ncoaches have only 'too full well<br />\nappreciated, namely, that we need<br />\nmore candidates endowed with<br />\ngreater physical strength than the<br />\nsquad now possesses. Saturday<br />\nwe were opposed by a team which<br />\ndoes not at all compare with the<br />\nopposition which we -fire bound,<br />\nfrom now on, to encounter; yet,<br />\n\u2022 its line was able, at times, to outplay ours, and this despite the<br />\nfact that our line had a most simple attack to cope with, as there<br />\nwere no complex formations to<br />\nbewilder the defense, nor was there<br />\nany \"shuttling\" of the back-field,<br />\nwhich in early games is apt to send<br />\npart of the defense forward rainbow chasing. It is devoutly hoped<br />\nthat some of the heavy men from<br />\nthe Medical School will present<br />\nthemselves this week. McKeithen,<br />\nPunk and Freedom did the best<br />\nline work, while Gorman did<br />\nmighty well in his down-field<br />\nwork.<br />\nThe, backfield, as individuals,<br />\ndid good work, for Brooks, Branham and Uhler lived up to expecta tions.

There is all<br />\nready evidence that this institution will become one of the leading<br />\nuniversities of the country and the<br />\ninaugural of the scholastic term<br />\nat the new location should not<br />\n\u2022<br />\nwithout generous accord of<br />\ncommendation to the promoters of<br />\nthis change who have toiled unceasingly to bring about the passing of the University from North<br />\n'Howard street to Homewood. In<br />\nfact, there should be some public<br />\nacknowledgment of this most important event so that honest tribute can be paid the institution,<br />\nthe faculty and the, directors.<br />\nJohns Hopkins University is<br />\ncoining into its own. There is<br />\nsomething analogous between its<br />\nstanding and that of the Johns<br />\nHopkins Hospital, which latter<br />\ninstitution was better known in<br />\nEurope 10 years ago than it<br />\nwas at home. Today the hospital is acclaimed by Baltimoreans as the greatest institution of its kind iii the country<br />\nand a most valuable asset to the<br />\ncity. Cooped up in the inadeqiiate HOward street buildings,<br />\nthe University has not been appreciated, but with the Homewood<br />\nexpansion, Baltimore and a nation of people are beginning to understand the wonderful prospects<br />\nof the institution.<br />\nConditions at Homewood are<br />\nideal for the making of one of the<br />\nmost important universities in the<br />\ncountry. Situated in the heart of<br />\none of the best residential sections<br />\nof the city, there is no danger of<br />\nconflicting encroachment. Both<br />\nthe site and the architectural<br />\ncharacter of the buildings are appealing and, there is ample room<br />\nfor the expansion, which must result from the speedy recognition<br />\nof the university facilities, both<br />\nscholastic and athletic.<br />\nWhen it is considered that Harvard, Yale or Princeton in their<br />\nbroken combination of buildings<br />\nwould give much for a composite<br />\nuniversity, then the present fortune of Johns Hopkins at Homewood can be understood. These<br />\nlarger institutions cannot be uprooted from their established locations without considerable expense and harmful traditionary<br />\nresults. Johns Hopkins is an old<br />\ninstitution, but the inadequateness of the old site has been so<br />\ngenerally recognized that the effect will be decidedly rejuvenating<br />\nrather than harmful. In this respect Johns Hopkins has a material advantage over other institutions of learning and it is not<br />\nsurprising that optimistic predictions are being made regarding<br />\nthe future of thelThiversily.<br /><br />\n[From the Baltimore News.]<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nWith the practical closing of<br />\nthe European universities, particularly of the German universities, it was reasonable to suppose<br />\nthat many of the students from<br />\nJapan and the Latin-American republics, from China and other<br />\ncountries, who, in normal times,<br />\nwould have sought these institutions, would turn to American<br />\ntemples of learning. Before the<br />\nwar, to be sure, we were by no<br />\nmeans without our students from<br />\nabroad; but, now their numbers<br />\nhave increased so greatly that it is<br />\nonly possible to ascribe the influx<br />\nto the shutting off of European<br />\nsources of instruction. In Baltimore, it seems, about 30 Oriental<br />\nstudents, several times as many as<br />\nusual, will take -up post-graduate<br />\nstudies this scholastic year.<br />\nIn the matter of serious postgraduate work, of course, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins University has at\u2022 tained international prestige. The<br />\nMedical School, for one thing, is<br />\nrenowned wherever men of science<br />\nassemble. Baltimoreans know as<br />\nmuch in a general way, but it is<br />\ndoubtful whether they sufficiently<br />\noften stop to think and by thinking to appreciate the distinction<br />\nwhich the Hopkins confers upon<br />\nthe city. To find foreign students<br />\nturning here in stick increasing<br />\nnumbers is gratifying. It is to be<br />\nhoped that after the war their<br />\nnumber will not wane, but will<br />\ncontinue to increase. And, so far<br />\nas the Hopkins is'concerned, it is<br />\nequally to be hoped that development will continue along the lines<br />\nlaid down by its organizers and<br />\nalong which it has already<br />\nachieved such fame and notable<br />\nresults\u2014university work in its<br />\ntrue sense.<br />\n\"Were you copying his notes?\"<br />\n\"Oh no, sir!

He was not only<br />\npainstaking and thorough, but in<br />\nin an unusual degree he was original. His research work was in a<br />\ndifficult field, involving a theoretical and practical inquiry into<br />\nthe fixation of wages in transportation. His reports to the Seminary were rather longer than<br />\nmost, and exhibited a diligence in<br />\nthe survey of material and a<br />\nchoiceness of expression that are<br />\nthe marks of finished scholarship.<br />\nEvery one felt that he had spent<br />\nupon his work many hours in addition to what ordinary standards would require. Not infrequently the nature of the study<br />\nand the fullness of the material<br />\nhe brought to light prompted him<br />\nto corrections and amendments<br />\nof foregoing writers that would<br />\nhave seemed presumptuous in one<br />\nof less integrity as a student. It<br />\nwas particularly his dissertation<br />\nthat attracted the economic department of Dartmouth College<br />\nto him; the field before him was<br />\nrich in possibilities, after the<br />\npromising beginning which he had<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nHe was intensely liked by every<br />\nmember of the Seminary for his<br />\nPersonal qualities. Courtesy and<br />\ncordiality that sprang from the<br />\nheart and deepest nature marked<br />\nhis whole intercourse with his<br />\nfellow-students. A sunny geniality went out from him, and compelled friendship. He was a person to draw you into pleasant conversations; how many little episodes in which he figured come<br />\ncrowding back upon those who<br />\nknew him well or slightly!<br />\nNoble Stockett did much to add<br />\nzest to the department.

ELLIOTT,<br />\nlit Lieut. 36th U. S. Infantry, Professor of Military<br />\nScience and Tactics.<br /><br />\nEditor's note\u2014Lieutenant Elliott, who<br />\nwill be in charge of the military training<br />\nat Hopkins this year, is a graduate of<br />\nthe University of Minnesota, and has<br />\nserved as a soldier in the Philippines, in<br />\nChina, and on the Mexican border. In<br />\nthe following article he explains the purpose and the nature of the military<br />\nwork which will be conducted at this<br />\nUniversity.<br /><br />\nIn introducing military training, Johns Hopkins is following<br />\nthe lead of nearly all the great<br />\neducational institutions throughout the, country today. The lessons of the great . war have<br />\nbrought home to the thinking people of the country the .vital importance of a better preparation<br />\nfor the day when. America, however unwilling, may be drawn into<br />\na similar struggle.<br />\nAmerican armies will, in all<br />\nprobability, be armies of volunteers and to command and drill<br />\nthe many thousands of willing<br />\nand patriotic, but ignorant and<br />\nuntrained masses of men, a large<br />\nnumber of officers will be required. Our small regular army<br />\ncan furnish only a very few of<br />\nthose needed. On it will fall the<br />\nburden of withstanding the first<br />\nonslaught of the enemy and most<br />\nof its personnel cannot be spared<br />\nfrom their posts.<br />\nThe new legislation recently<br />\npassed by Congress attempts to<br />\nprovide, for these deficiencies by<br />\ntraining reserve officers men who<br />\nwill be sufficiently schooled in<br />\nmilitary work to step from civil<br />\nlife into the ranks and at once<br />\ncommand and instruct volunteers.<br />\nThe training and instruction of<br />\nthese reserve officers is to take<br />\nplace at the various colleges and<br />\nuniversities of the country, and<br />\nhere at Hopkins we are to organize this week a unit to be known<br />\nas The Reserve Officers' Training<br />\nCorps, Johns Hopkins University.<br />\n,The course of training will extend over two years and students<br />\nwho, have covered the course and<br />\nare recomniended by those in<br />\ncharge of the work will receive<br />\nfrom the War Department commissions in the Regular Army Reserve. While possibly only a limited number of _those who undergo<br />\nthe training will be found fitted<br />\nto accept these commissions, one<br />\nand all will benefit physically<br />\nand mentally by the lessons in<br />\ndiscipline, co-ordination and teamwork, which are the essence of<br />\nmilitary training. One of the<br />\nhardest, things for Americans to<br />\nlearn\u2014the habit of precise, unhesitating obedience to the will of<br />\na leader\u2014is the one habit of the<br />\nmost importance to the country<br />\non the field of battle.<br />\n(Continued on page 7, col. 1)<br /><br />\nwho are especially qualified in<br />\nparticular practical subjects.<br />\nIn electrical engineering two<br />\nArrangements Completed for Giving of Work to Begin October 17 All Three<br />\ncourses are offered.
