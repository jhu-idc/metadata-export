Guest<br />\nspeakers were Ross Flanagan,<br />\nLillian Willoughby, David<br />\nSherman, and George<br />\nWilloughby, all of the Life<br />\nCentre, a community self-help<br />\ngroup from West Philadelphia.<br />\nAbout 50 Homewood area<br />\nresidents attended the generally<br />\nserious presentation.<br />\nSome Things<br />\n\"Too many conflicting<br />\nexpectations are placed on police<br />\nofficers today,\" Flanagan stated,<br />\n\"so we of the Life Centre have<br />\ntried to accept responsibility for<br />\nsome of the things police have<br />\ntraditionally done. This means<br />\nneighborhood organization, such<br />\nas trying to get owners of vacant<br />\nhouses to give up these staging<br />\nareas for crime to the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\n..Noting that organized areas<br />\nhave less crime than unorganized<br />\nareas, Lillian Willoughby<br />\nexplained the psychology of<br />\nneighborhood organization<br />\nagainst crime. \"Safety hints are<br />\nimportant, but when we step out<br />\n<br />\nFreshman Dormitory room<br />\n<br />\nof our doors we consider the<br />\nperson on the street as a friend,<br />\nrather than being suspicious,\"<br />\nsaid Mrs. Willoughby.<br />\nFeel Safer<br />\nDavid Sherman detailed his<br />\nclaim that the Lite Centre has<br />\ngiven the streets back to the<br />\npeople. \"If the person on the<br />\nstreet is known to you, you feel<br />\nsafer, and we put that idea to<br />\nwork,\" said Sherman. \"Making a<br />\nphysical presence so muggers and<br />\nburglars don't have the streets all<br />\nto themselves led to our proposal<br />\nfor a neighborhood walk,\"<br />\nSherman continued.<br />\n\"We have 75 walkers who go<br />\naround the neighborhood. The<br />\nprecinct captain told us we<br />\nwouldn't last six months, but<br />\nwe've been at it for a year,\" lie<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"I've been in this<br />\nneighborhood walk,\" said George<br />\nWilloughby, \"and it's pretty<br />\nboring sometimes.\" Emphasising<br />\nthe \"brother's keeper\"<br />\norientation of stopping crime, he<br />\nadded, \"When we're out the<br />\nstreets are safe, but when we're<br />\nin hiding behind locked doors<br />\nwith the shades drawn the streets<br />\nbecome highways of crime.\"<br />\n<br />\nFlanagan asked his audience<br />\nwhat they thought were their<br />\nneighborhood problems. Answers<br />\nincluded angry voices on the<br />\nstreets at night, break-ins in<br />\nhouses and cars. anonimity,<br />\ntrash, loose dogs. racial tension.<br />\nand a lack of' step-sitters.<br />\nTo illustrate how women are<br />\naccosted on the street. Flanagan<br />\ncalled on two people in the<br />\naudience to stage a<br />\npurse-snatching. The man got the<br />\npurse with little trouble, but the<br />\nwoman gave chase to him<br />\nunsuccessfully. When asked why,<br />\nshe explained, \"I was mad! I<br />\nwanted that purse back!\"<br />\nThrow It Away<br />\nFlanagan then counselled. \"If<br />\na man comes at you. let go of the<br />\npurse -- if the man wants a fix, he<br />\ndoesn't care for or about you, he<br />\nwants the purse. Throw it away!<br />\nMake him decide how badly he<br />\nwants it.\"<br />\nContinuing with other ways to<br />\nstop attackers, Flanagan stressed<br />\nthat any way to disorient an<br />\nattacker would help. \"The<br />\nassaulter wants a predictable<br />\nvictim,\" he noted.<br />\nMembers of Life Centre<br />\nrecommended their personal<br />\n<br />\nalarm system based upon<br />\nfreon-gas horns. \"Carry a freon<br />\nhorn,\" was Flanagan's advice.<br />\n\"Unlike tear-gas pens or mace or<br />\nknitting needles, it can't be used<br />\nagainst you. This does not cause<br />\nan escalation of violence,\"<br />\nFlanagan noted.<br />\nGet Horned<br />\n\"Muggers don't like noise.\"<br />\nFlanagan asserted soberly,\"so set<br />\nup a network of people with<br />\nhorns. They'll start listening to<br />\nthe street. and when one is<br />\nsounded on the street, people in<br />\ntheir houses should come out and<br />\nblow their freon horns.<br />\n\"As our experience in West<br />\nPhiladelphia has shown,\"<br />\nFlanagan continued. \"a mugger<br />\nwill clear out because he'll think<br />\nyou're all after him.\" \"Call the<br />\npolice, have a few men blowing<br />\nhorns chase him, and you'll<br />\nprobably catch the mugger.\"<br />\nTo prevent burglaries.<br />\nSherman suggested. \"Engrave all<br />\nyour fenceable valuables and let<br />\nit be known. Prospective burglars<br />\nwon't go after goods they can't<br />\nunload.

The price<br />\nfor a seven-day , 21-meal plan<br />\nwill be $785. In addition, there<br />\nwill be a new five-day,<br />\nfifteen-meal plan (Monday thru<br />\nFriday) which will cost $710.<br />\nThe latter plan is being instituted<br />\nprimarily for the benefit of<br />\nstudents who are not on campus<br />\nduring weekends, and is not<br />\nintended to encourage students<br />\nto cook their own meals on<br />\nweekends, Heist stated.<br />\nTentative plans call for<br />\ndormitory meal passes to be<br />\naccepted in the Levering<br />\ncafeteria.<br />\nRefrigerators will be allowed<br />\nto a limited number of students,<br />\nand hot plates will still be<br />\nprohibited.. \"It is hoped that<br />\nmoney will be available to install<br />\na kitchen in the basement of the<br />\ndorms for dormitory residents.\"<br />\nAll campus food concessions<br />\nwill be operated next year by<br />\nSaga Food Service, which is<br />\ncurrently operating at Goucher<br />\nCollege.

Most Student Council<br />\nendeavors resemble the headless wonderment which Kurt<br />\nVonnegut, Jr., writing in Cat's Cradle, terms \"busy, busy,<br />\nbusy.\"<br />\nWhile Andy Savitz's 63 per cent of the record number<br />\nof votes cast in last week's election does not reveal a<br />\ncataclysmic love affair between him and his electorate, it is<br />\nnonetheless an impressive indication of the widespread<br />\nsupport which the President has developed in less than two<br />\nyears here.<br />\nWhether Savitz's huge majority was solely the result of<br />\nhis positions on the issues \u2014 insofar as the issue was not<br />\nSavitz himself, \u2014 and not the result of his apparent relative<br />\ncompetence over the remaining three candidates, who<br />\nranged from bumbling and inarticulate to downright<br />\nvindictive, the results do not show. And whether or not<br />\nthe 1152 undergraduates who bothered to vote in the<br />\nelection made wise choices or not is similarly unclear.<br />\nBut the fact that half the undergraduate body expressed<br />\nenough interest in the campaign to vote is significant in<br />\nitself. Hopkins students are becoming more interested in<br />\nwhat the Student Council is up to, if for no other reason<br />\nthan that the Council is beginning to work on significant<br />\nissues which affect all undergraduates, such as the Honor<br />\nCode. While traditional Council shenanigans will probably<br />\ncontinue throughout the second term of Savitz's<br />\npresidency, that this year's Council has looked at the<br />\nHonor Code, among other matters, is certainly to the<br />\ncredit of both the Council and Savitz's leadership.

The Johns Hopkins Philological Association met<br />\nin room 20, as one professor lectured to thirty or thirty\u2014five<br />\nothers. Another entry was made in<br />\nthe handwritten minutes. They are<br />\nprobably the only written account<br />\na tradition.<br />\nDictionaries don't agree:. \"Philology<br />\nthe study of literature and<br />\nof re,levant disciplines.\" \"Philology<br />\n\u2014 historical and comparative linguistics.\" \"Philology \u2014 the scientific study of language.\"<br />\nIgnore them all. The formal definitions make it sound dry and<br />\ndead. Much better to talk about<br />\nthe people involved.<br />\nHopkins' first philologist was its<br />\nfirst professor, Basil Gildersleeve, a<br />\nSouth Carolinian with a huge beard<br />\ncovering a civil war saber scar. He<br />\norganized the Association and was<br />\nchairman of its first meeting in October 1877. Three years later he<br />\nfounded the Anierican Journal of<br />\nPhilology, a quarterly whose most<br />\nrecent issue is on A\u2014level right<br />\nnow. Conclusion: There has always<br />\nbeen an interest in antiquity and<br />\nlanguages at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nBut the subject needs to be sectioned: Some people study Indo\u2014<br />\nEuropean languages, others consider the Romance group, and a third<br />\nset work with languages of the ancient Near East.

It is a matter of priority and more importantly, a matter<br />\nof time.

Yet, as the<br />\nplay proceeded, I began to feel<br />\nthat something was amiss. The set I<br />\nrealized, failed to capture the<br />\ngloomy, medieval atmosphere intended by Pirandello.<br />\nThe staging of the production<br />\nwas similarly unnerving. At times,<br />\nit was brilliantly effective. At other<br />\ntimes, the movements of the actors<br />\nwere distracting and unnecessary.<br />\nAs for the acting, I was left with<br />\ndecidedly mixed feelings. An actor<br />\nwho deserves uncompromising applause is Paul Hecht.

Harrison, like other actors in the production, is just a little too delicate<br />\nand uninvolved.<br />\nPirandello's play is an exceedingly talky one.

I decided not to go back to<br />\nsleep. Instead, I took this comfortable chair<br />\nfacing the window and the bed and have<br />\nbeen watching the rain since then. I am also<br />\nwatching the girl who is asleep in my bed.<br />\nIt's very peaceful and quiet now, a time<br />\nwhen most of the immediate world has volunteered its silence and absence. A time<br />\nwhen little or nothing has to be said. And<br />\nthat suits me. The cumulative effect of the<br />\nmorning is particularly pacifying.<br />\n<br />\nspring<br />\n<br />\n)f.<br />\n<br />\nis<br />\n<br />\n,e<br />\nit<br />\nLe<br />\nir<br />\n:h<br />\nir<br />\n<br />\nte<br />\nr.<br />\nal<br />\nin<br />\nes<br />\ny.<br />\n;h<br />\ns<br />\ner<br />\n)n<br />\n<br />\n:e<br />\n<br />\nse<br />\n<br />\nn,<br />\n<br />\nCe<br />\nte<br />\n<br />\nShe is sleeping soundly and has one robust<br />\nlong leg from slender foot to womanly spread<br />\nhip stuck out of the covers. She says she<br />\ndoes that when her legs get too warm: sticking one out always takes care of it. As 1 got<br />\nup, a bit chilled on the shoulders, I wanted<br />\nto cover her up, but she mumbled in her<br />\nsleep that she was too hot. It is nice and<br />\nwarm in here this morning, so I have not had<br />\nto dress. The rain is steady, the first real<br />\nspring rain we have had. The rain may be as<br />\npacifying as anything else. I expected it<br />\nwould still be raining when I woke. I anticipated nothing else, and disappointment did<br />\nnot greet me under the blanket of cloudgray<br />\nsullen shades. That suits me too. The grass<br />\nhas miraculously turned green overnight and<br />\nsoft verdant hints are tufting the swollen<br />\nnodes of branches dangling outside the<br />\nwindow. Pregnant spring. Au printemps. Oui.<br />\nBon. She is fond of French. We hold little dialogs. It surprised her that I could reply,<br />\nnever having been out of the country. I was<br />\nnot surprised that she spoke a foreign language,French least of all.<br />\n<br />\nthe forecast<br />\nThe raindrops are meshed into the window<br />\nscreen. The rain had begun very early this<br />\nmorning, shortly after we had turned off the<br />\nlight. The way it looks now, it'll rain all day.<br />\n<br />\ndirty feet<br />\n<br />\n!st<br />\n<br />\njy<br />\nlii<br />\n<br />\nhe<br />\n<br />\nitS<br />\n<br />\nat<br />\n<br />\nal<br />\n<br />\nhe<br />\n'or<br />\n<br />\nne<br />\nal<br />\n<br />\nOnce in a while she snores lightly for a few<br />\nminutes because she is sleeping on .her back.<br />\nAs she gets louder she seems to catch herself,<br />\ncloses her mouth, and stops. Her toes on the<br />\nfoot sticking out wiggle occasionally as if<br />\nthey were electrically operated, and almost<br />\nmake me laugh. She is clutching a kleenex in<br />\none hand because she has a slight cold or allergy (we're not sure which) and has to clear<br />\nher nose in the night. The bottoms of her<br />\nfeet are filthy, as usual, but that did not stop<br />\nme from letting her in my bed.<br />\n<br />\ncontentment<br />\n<br />\nlit<br />\n<br />\nI listened to. the rain last night while trying<br />\n<br />\nt'o go to sleep. I was very tired and had had a<br />\nheadache all day. But I could not get to<br />\nsleep. When she finally got into bed after me,<br />\nI didnot feel like doing; the thing that helps<br />\nme go to sleep fast and sleep well. That was<br />\na consequence of the course of the night. So<br />\nwe lay there trying to ignore the gaping<br />\ndrizzly silence between us. I must have dozed<br />\noff, because when I opened my eyes she had<br />\ngotten up and was putting on her clothes. A<br />\ndisastrously' \u2022 light sleep, the slightest disturbances, even when she or I turn over at night,wakes me. I rolled over onto the center of<br />\nthe pillow and watched her try to close the<br />\ndoor quietly as she went out, supposing me<br />\nstill<br />\nMy cheek felt the damp spot<br />\nwhere her silent tears had dropped. After<br />\nthat I tried to go back to sleep, but could<br />\nnot. I just lay there listening to the rain and<br />\nwaited and was content with being able to do<br />\nthat.<br />\n<br />\nthe girl<br />\nShe has just turned, and now a full side of<br />\nher smooth skinned model's body is exposed,<br />\nthe front towards me. It is not perfect; she<br />\ncould stand to trim her thighs and hips, for<br />\n<br />\nThe Model<br />\nas a Virgin<br />\n<br />\n90)<br />\n<br />\nmy liking. I would never tell het that,<br />\nthough. Her stomach is wonderfully firm, yet<br />\nfemininFlyiarbors enough flesh above the muscles for me to sink my teeth in. It is strange<br />\nto think of myself going to bed with this girl<br />\nwho models naked for other people. Every<br />\nonce in a while I'm struck with that realization. Sometimes confronted with it. And I do<br />\nnot know whether I am going to laugh or<br />\nnot. I, too, had acquired the usual set<br />\nconceptions, obviosuly erroneous, of the type<br />\nof girl who poses without any clothes on to<br />\nbe drawn or photographed ,thoroughly scrutinized by :men's crevice-searching eyes. We<br />\nexpect a generous portion of the exotic, the<br />\nbohemiam, the flamboyant, the Isadora<br />\nDuncan to be characteristic of them. We<br />\nwant that, pry for it, something both desirably attractive and poisonously contaminating<br />\nthat leaves us in adventurous ambivalence. We<br />\nwant the freedom of spirit and from inhibition we feel they will be able to bestow upon<br />\nus, as if we were in need of psychic liberation; yet we are frightened by the prospect<br />\nof undefined artistic abandon. So it was,<br />\nwhen I first met her. I had never imagined<br />\nknowing such a girl. But when I did, the aura<br />\nof unconventionality, the exotic that I<br />\nsought, did not seem to surround either her<br />\nor her job. Disappointment. I don't even think<br />\nabout it now, much. I care less and less each<br />\nday what she is. Were I to be truthful with<br />\nmyself and her, I would probably admit that<br />\nI care less now who she is.<br />\n<br />\nunderwear<br />\nHer bikini underwear with pictures of strawberries and grapes and berries is lying crumpled up on the floor on her side of the bed.<br />\nShe took them off shortly after the second<br />\ntime she got into bed last night, after I had<br />\nwaited a long time for her to come back. I<br />\nknew she had not left for good because her<br />\nbag and coat were lying across this chair. She<br />\nwas gone for longer than I could keep track,<br />\nalthough I did not sleep. She must have gone<br />\nfor a walk out to the lobby, or sat quietly<br />\nout in the kitchen. I did not ask her, and I<br />\nprobably won't. When I heard her come back<br />\nin, I briefly considered pretending I was<br />\nasleep. But I rolled over and made room for<br />\nher. She took off everything except her<br />\nunderpants, and I put out my arms for her to<br />\ncrawl into. I had gone to bed with my underwear on. That is the kind of night it had<br />\nturned into by the time I undressed and got<br />\nunder the covers. We had kept talking, with<br />\nher sitting in this chair and me in bed, until<br />\nshe said that when other people did what I<br />\nhad done, she she despised them; but when I<br />\ndid what I had done, she became afraid. I<br />\nhad shut her off. Then I just shook my head<br />\nand laughed to myself and turned out the<br />\nlight. It was not a hurnourous laugh. It was<br />\nexasperation and befuddlement. My way of<br />\nescaping the pressing necessity of the situation and the response expected of me. I was<br />\nvery sorry, but I could not say anything, not<br />\na single word more. Not at two in the morning...,<br />\n<br />\nreminders<br />\nMy underwear is lying on the floor on the<br />\nother side of the bed. I know that a fresh<br />\ncome stain spots my sheet, probably directly<br />\nunder her soft angular butt. The come is<br />\n\u2022 dried around my hair and makes it clump<br />\ntogether in bunches. And I know if I do not<br />\nshower today I will sweat later on,and it will<br />\nget moist and sticky and fragrant, like the<br />\nsap of lilacs. I used to look forward to that<br />\nis a pleasant reminder during the day. The<br />\n3nly other reminder is the stain on my sheet,<br />\nand that will remind me of the nights she is<br />\nnot or won't be here. I shall probably shower<br />\nlater, after she leaves.<br />\n<br />\nan affliction<br />\nWhen she got back in I asked her did she<br />\nwant to talk now? She answered by asking<br />\ndid I? I ignored her question and waited a<br />\ncDuple of minutes, then asked again This was<br />\na concession on my part, for I was the one<br />\nwho had stopped talking. The discussion we<br />\nhad carried on up until we went to bed<br />\nhad<br />\ngotten us nowhere, so typically the case. I did<br />\nnot find sufficient reason for a lot of words.<br />\nMy curt answers to her questions, which ware<br />\ncontinued on page 4<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\n\fLetter<br />\nUnder the same bare

I<br />\ntake them and mean them as lightly as possible, and want others to, also, though some<br />\nseem to be struck to the core afterwards by<br />\nmy off-hand comments. People take me too<br />\nseriously. My saracastic defensive attacks on<br />\nevery little thing she has said upset her. I<br />\ntrapped her in word games and was downright literal until she herself was afraid to<br />\nspeak. She made the final effort before I<br />\nturned out the light to explain what I had<br />\ndone to her, for I had not clearly understood, nor been aware of my\u2014self.<br />\n<br />\na cure<br />\nShe is perhaps too sensitive a person for a<br />\ncynic like me. I'm not sensitive enough; I've<br />\nbeen told that. But after she explained, I saw<br />\nclearly enough what I had done to upset her.<br />\nI thought of a thousand things I could have<br />\nsaid to her then, among them that she had<br />\njust supplied proof for my theory (which she<br />\nscorns) that my own attempts at verbal communication are usually a failure and that I<br />\nshould speak as little as possible. It is a discipline: I have advocated for years, to the<br />\ndiscontent, I am not happy to say, of many<br />\npeople whom I believe would like to have<br />\ntold me more about themselves than I would<br />\ntolerate. But I was afraid that any of those<br />\nthousand things would have upset her just as<br />\nmuch. So I did not say anything, though I<br />\nknew she would not appreciate that either. It<br />\nwas too late at night. I just turned out the<br />\nlight and watched her undress and crawl into<br />\nbed where we only stared at each other in<br />\nthe adjusting darkness while the rain begah,<br />\noutside.<br />\n<br />\nwhat she needs<br />\nWhen I decided the end point had been<br />\nreached , decided to quit to save some remnants, she thought I was shutting her off<br />\nagain. And nothing was any closer to being<br />\nsolved. I know she needed my words, and<br />\nthat is bad:deterioration. Even worse, I did<br />\nnot want t give them. I wanted to go to<br />\nsleep, or I<br />\nted it to be the next day. It is<br />\nraining hard now suddenly, and it looks as<br />\nif she might.144,a:: ke up.

With her<br />\ntivity she ought to he able to tell what's<br />\ny how I have spoken the few words I<br />\nave already said. After\u2022 all, I'm not<br />\n, not voiceless. But she wants me to<br />\nsp myself for her. She said what I must<br />\nne<br />\nis a mind reader. I almost told her I<br />\nwith her. I think that would be per3gr,<br />\nrect She says she does not let me guess what<br />\nIs in her head, but she's wrong there. I could<br />\nnot tell last night. But then, I had scared ner<br />\ninto not talking after a while, and I'm so insensitive to begin with. I want hgr to sleep<br />\n<br />\nnow, sleep all day. If she wakes<br />\nI shall<br />\nhave to say something and break t<br />\nlovely<br />\nquietness of light rain on soft sprt grass.<br />\nWe shall be ficed with the option o-A-esum-<br />\n<br />\ning where:we left off last night or completely<br />\nignoring it. Too early for her to wake up<br />\nnow. She does not appreciate the morning,<br />\nanyhow.<br />\n<br />\nconversation<br />\nI knew she would want to talk. I knew that,<br />\nbad as it might be, any intimate susurration<br />\nin the close darkness was the best thing for<br />\nus to do when she slipped back into bed. We<br />\nfaced each other, and I held my arm around<br />\nher narrow, rib-boned back. After the second<br />\ntime I asked her, she tried to smile, and then<br />\nbegan to explain how maybe it would be better, easier for her, if she did not care so<br />\nmuch. She thought everything would be much<br />\nbetter if she just did not care, if she was not<br />\nafraid. I wanted to tell her she was right. It<br />\nwould be better. I knew. But I just could not<br />\nsay that to her; it was not the proper time to<br />\ndeal in those terms. I had known I would be<br />\nsorry we had begun talking, because I knew<br />\nit would get bad sooner or later. But she had<br />\ncome back instead of leaving in the night altogether, so there was no other course for me<br />\nto take. We both compromised. I tried to say<br />\nas little as possible. She wished she did not<br />\nworry so much, and I told myself again how<br />\nover sensitive she was. And then I became<br />\nafraid an instint as I anticipated what I<br />\nthought she would say rt'el'X' t. Silent an unnatural moment, she scared me. I was afraid she<br />\nwas going to say she was in love with me. I<br />\nwould neither agree, nor protest, nor discuss<br />\nthe matter. Not at night. Not facing each<br />\nother in bed. Three o'clock in the morning, I<br />\nhave found, is not an efficacious nor intelligent time to cope with that kind of matter.<br />\nBed is not the garden of truthhood, either. I<br />\nwould wait until daytime, the daylight, and if<br />\nthe point was pressed, would deal with it<br />\nthen. But she did not say it, and I had only<br />\nfallen prey to the egotism that secretly hoped<br />\nshe felt that way towards inc. A pathetic but<br />\nwidely appreciated condition.<br />\n<br />\ndiversion<br />\nI began kissing her and she was glad to respond. 1 moved against her and let her know .<br />\nWhen we were kissing we could not be talking. I said one thitig more. I asked her did<br />\nshe want to? She nodded; I detected a smile,<br />\nand we did. After we took off our underwear. I know I had done the best thing and<br />\nthat she was happier then.,<br />\n<br />\ndigression<br />\nA bizarre thing happened to me that I cannot<br />\nintegrate with everything else. Ic., was very<br />\nhumid in the room and under 'the covers.<br />\nThree times for her, that tension which relaxes, and biting back ,g,cstatic oral release.<br />\nThe first was the best, and I thought k could<br />\nfeel her pores open; then more and more<br />\nly after that. I was tired, but her<br />\nre ons flattered, and I enjoyed it. When I<br />\ntoo 'my turn I felt mv head get light and I<br />\nthought I was going to pass out. I think . I<br />\nhad been holding my breath, though I'm<br />\nnot<br />\nSure how long Iliad. I had to stop. And then<br />\nI fell asleep with my face in her hair. When<br />\nI<br />\nrolled off I felt as if I had been punched in<br />\nthe stomach, and she got us a glass of water.<br />\nI guess I had not been feeling well.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nsupposition<br />\nI did not sleep well last night either. It got<br />\nlight out and in before I knew it. I have gotten up early and am not surprised the rain<br />\ncontinues to fall. I feel calm and still, though<br />\n<br />\nnot very energetic, and I have nothing to do<br />\ntoday but sit here. She will sleep for a long<br />\nwhile yet, not capable of enjoying a rainy<br />\nmorning. I do not think I would want her to<br />\nbe. She likes to talk too much. She likes to<br />\nsleep and if she had her way would probably<br />\nsleep all day, waking as the sun sets. When<br />\nshe does wake we shall probably both pretend everything is all right, that somehow<br />\nthings worked themselves out in our sleep, or<br />\nin our physical and mock-passionate denial of<br />\nthe perplexities between us, which are my<br />\nduty now to equilibrate. Of that in the dark,<br />\nthings were legitimately obscure and doubtful, and the daylight will clarify everything.<br />\nAt least I did not catch her actually crying she did not break down in front of me. I do<br />\nnot know what she did or where she went<br />\nwhen she got up. And I will ignore it, not<br />\nmention it today. If she had begun audibly<br />\ncrying in front of me, I may have succumbed<br />\nto anything she said or did. I cannot cope<br />\nwith a woman crying, least of all in my bed<br />\nat night.<br />\n<br />\nthe model<br />\nShe will model this afternoon. She likes to<br />\nbelieve that her modeling has nothing to do<br />\nwith virginity. But one time I cornered her<br />\ninto .admitting that were she a fully intact<br />\nvirgin, she would not be so ready to disrobe<br />\nfor any kind of audience. Virginity is a matter of degree, I am sure; relative. I have supposed, to amuse myself, an inversely proportional relationship between the quantity of<br />\nher remaining virginity and the amount of<br />\nmodeling she has done. She must have pockets of it, veins of it. Maybe those I am trying<br />\nto mine and expose. Only to plunder. Because I cannot draw, am not an artist, I must<br />\nrelieve the other side of the scale and do my<br />\npart to serve the proportional balance. Yet<br />\nwhatever virginity she came to me with I<br />\nhave not been able to touch, nor eradicate,<br />\nnor diminish. She is just as whole. There has<br />\nto be some left. Somewhere untouched.<br />\nThough she goes on modeling, I am still<br />\nsearching. I am also deliberately complicating<br />\nher, posing explanations for my continued involvement.<br />\n<br />\nthe virgin<br />\nNow she has rolled over on her other side.<br />\nShe breathes with her mouth open, lips<br />\nslightly parted because of an incomplete overbite. She has got several hours of sleep to go.<br />\nHer large breasts are squashed between her<br />\narms, her hands pulled up under her chin,<br />\nand she looks childlike. In a few hours she<br />\nwill get up and go model. They should come<br />\nand draw her now, the way she is asleep.<br />\nThere it is : the virginity she yet has must be<br />\nmanifest only in her sleep, and I would like<br />\nto see an artist able to capture it forever.<br />\nhave no idea how long it will last by itself.<br />\nAnd after all, how often do they get a virgin<br />\nto model for them. She is actually pretty<br />\nwhen she is quiet, and I would like to make<br />\nlove with her right now. But that would only<br />\nwake her.<br />\n<br />\nthe forecast<br />\nI shall have to sit here until she wakes, and<br />\nthat will content me. But when she does<br />\nwake I shall have to think of something to<br />\nsay. She will blink and try to smile, maybe<br />\nfrown out the window and ask what time it<br />\nis. She will probably ask me how I slept, how<br />\nlong I have been up, and what I have been<br />\ndoing. And I shall probably say: pretty well:<br />\na few minutes; just watching you.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "State aid bill appears heading<br />\nfor a favorable response today<br />\nBy BILL ABBOTT<br />\nAn informal News-Letter<br />\ncanvass of the Maryland Senate<br />\nFinance Committee indicates<br />\nthat Senate Bill 848, the<br />\nproposed legislation which<br />\nauthorizes a $573,000 grant in<br />\nunconditional state funding to<br />\nHopkins if passed, will receive a<br />\nfavorable response in today's<br />\nscheduled Committee vote.<br />\nThe proposed bill, which has<br />\nthe endorsement of Governor<br />\nMandel and Senate Finance<br />\nCommittee Chairman (also<br />\nSenate Majority Leader) George<br />\nE.

Guest<br />\nspeakers were Ross Flanagan,<br />\nLillian Willoughby, David<br />\nSherman, and George<br />\nWilloughby, all of the Life<br />\nCentre, a community self-help<br />\ngroup from West Philadelphia.<br />\nAbout 50 Homewood area<br />\nresidents attended the generally<br />\nserious presentation.<br />\nSome Things<br />\n\"Too many conflicting<br />\nexpectations are placed on police<br />\nofficers today,\" Flanagan stated,<br />\n\"so we of the Life Centre have<br />\ntried to accept responsibility for<br />\nsome of the things police have<br />\ntraditionally done. This means<br />\nneighborhood organization, such<br />\nas trying to get owners of vacant<br />\nhouses to give up these staging<br />\nareas for crime to the<br />\ncommunity.\"<br />\n..Noting that organized areas<br />\nhave less crime than unorganized<br />\nareas, Lillian Willoughby<br />\nexplained the psychology of<br />\nneighborhood organization<br />\nagainst crime. \"Safety hints are<br />\nimportant, but when we step out<br /><br />\nFreshman Dormitory room<br /><br />\nof our doors we consider the<br />\nperson on the street as a friend,<br />\nrather than being suspicious,\"<br />\nsaid Mrs. Willoughby.<br />\nFeel Safer<br />\nDavid Sherman detailed his<br />\nclaim that the Lite Centre has<br />\ngiven the streets back to the<br />\npeople. \"If the person on the<br />\nstreet is known to you, you feel<br />\nsafer, and we put that idea to<br />\nwork,\" said Sherman. \"Making a<br />\nphysical presence so muggers and<br />\nburglars don't have the streets all<br />\nto themselves led to our proposal<br />\nfor a neighborhood walk,\"<br />\nSherman continued.<br />\n\"We have 75 walkers who go<br />\naround the neighborhood. The<br />\nprecinct captain told us we<br />\nwouldn't last six months, but<br />\nwe've been at it for a year,\" lie<br />\nsaid.<br />\n\"I've been in this<br />\nneighborhood walk,\" said George<br />\nWilloughby, \"and it's pretty<br />\nboring sometimes.\" Emphasising<br />\nthe \"brother's keeper\"<br />\norientation of stopping crime, he<br />\nadded, \"When we're out the<br />\nstreets are safe, but when we're<br />\nin hiding behind locked doors<br />\nwith the shades drawn the streets<br />\nbecome highways of crime.\"<br /><br />\nFlanagan asked his audience<br />\nwhat they thought were their<br />\nneighborhood problems. Answers<br />\nincluded angry voices on the<br />\nstreets at night, break-ins in<br />\nhouses and cars. anonimity,<br />\ntrash, loose dogs. racial tension.<br />\nand a lack of' step-sitters.<br />\nTo illustrate how women are<br />\naccosted on the street. Flanagan<br />\ncalled on two people in the<br />\naudience to stage a<br />\npurse-snatching. The man got the<br />\npurse with little trouble, but the<br />\nwoman gave chase to him<br />\nunsuccessfully. When asked why,<br />\nshe explained, \"I was mad! I<br />\nwanted that purse back!\"<br />\nThrow It Away<br />\nFlanagan then counselled. \"If<br />\na man comes at you. let go of the<br />\npurse -- if the man wants a fix, he<br />\ndoesn't care for or about you, he<br />\nwants the purse. Throw it away!<br />\nMake him decide how badly he<br />\nwants it.\"<br />\nContinuing with other ways to<br />\nstop attackers, Flanagan stressed<br />\nthat any way to disorient an<br />\nattacker would help. \"The<br />\nassaulter wants a predictable<br />\nvictim,\" he noted.<br />\nMembers of Life Centre<br />\nrecommended their personal<br /><br />\nalarm system based upon<br />\nfreon-gas horns. \"Carry a freon<br />\nhorn,\" was Flanagan's advice.<br />\n\"Unlike tear-gas pens or mace or<br />\nknitting needles, it can't be used<br />\nagainst you. This does not cause<br />\nan escalation of violence,\"<br />\nFlanagan noted.<br />\nGet Horned<br />\n\"Muggers don't like noise.\"<br />\nFlanagan asserted soberly,\"so set<br />\nup a network of people with<br />\nhorns. They'll start listening to<br />\nthe street. and when one is<br />\nsounded on the street, people in<br />\ntheir houses should come out and<br />\nblow their freon horns.<br />\n\"As our experience in West<br />\nPhiladelphia has shown,\"<br />\nFlanagan continued. \"a mugger<br />\nwill clear out because he'll think<br />\nyou're all after him.\" \"Call the<br />\npolice, have a few men blowing<br />\nhorns chase him, and you'll<br />\nprobably catch the mugger.\"<br />\nTo prevent burglaries.<br />\nSherman suggested. \"Engrave all<br />\nyour fenceable valuables and let<br />\nit be known. Prospective burglars<br />\nwon't go after goods they can't<br />\nunload. Students' stereos are<br />\nprized, so students especially<br />\nshould engrave valuables,\" he<br />\ncautioned.<br /><br />\n$715 for singles.<br />\n\"Every possible effort was<br />\nmade to keep the rate increases<br />\nto a minimum,\" Fitzpatrick<br />\ncommented. Heist linked the<br />\nincreases to rising university costs<br />\nfor labor and utilities.<br />\nTenants in other university<br />\nowned housing similarly<br />\nabsorbed increased rates in 1972.<br />\nThe raises were 12 per cent for<br />\nsingle undergraduates and seven<br />\npercent for graduate and married<br />\nstudents. The new rates will vary<br />\nfrom unit to unit. Monthly<br />\nincreases are expected to range<br />\nfrom three to ten dollars over<br />\npresent rates. A complete<br />\nschedule of the new rates is now<br />\navailable at the Housing Office in<br />\nWolman Hall.<br />\nThe university also announced<br />\nit will offer two meal plans to<br />\nstudents who wish to eat in the<br />\ndormitory dining hall. The price<br />\nfor a seven-day , 21-meal plan<br />\nwill be $785. In addition, there<br />\nwill be a new five-day,<br />\nfifteen-meal plan (Monday thru<br />\nFriday) which will cost $710.<br />\nThe latter plan is being instituted<br />\nprimarily for the benefit of<br />\nstudents who are not on campus<br />\nduring weekends, and is not<br />\nintended to encourage students<br />\nto cook their own meals on<br />\nweekends, Heist stated.<br />\nTentative plans call for<br />\ndormitory meal passes to be<br />\naccepted in the Levering<br />\ncafeteria.<br />\nRefrigerators will be allowed<br />\nto a limited number of students,<br />\nand hot plates will still be<br />\nprohibited.. \"It is hoped that<br />\nmoney will be available to install<br />\na kitchen in the basement of the<br />\ndorms for dormitory residents.\"<br />\nAll campus food concessions<br />\nwill be operated next year by<br />\nSaga Food Service, which is<br />\ncurrently operating at Goucher<br />\nCollege.

Hopkins students are becoming more interested in<br />\nwhat the Student Council is up to, if for no other reason<br />\nthan that the Council is beginning to work on significant<br />\nissues which affect all undergraduates, such as the Honor<br />\nCode. While traditional Council shenanigans will probably<br />\ncontinue throughout the second term of Savitz's<br />\npresidency, that this year's Council has looked at the<br />\nHonor Code, among other matters, is certainly to the<br />\ncredit of both the Council and Savitz's leadership.

The Johns Hopkins Philological Association met<br />\nin room 20, as one professor lectured to thirty or thirty\u2014five<br />\nothers. Another entry was made in<br />\nthe handwritten minutes.

The formal definitions make it sound dry and<br />\ndead. Much better to talk about<br />\nthe people involved.<br />\nHopkins' first philologist was its<br />\nfirst professor, Basil Gildersleeve, a<br />\nSouth Carolinian with a huge beard<br />\ncovering a civil war saber scar. He<br />\norganized the Association and was<br />\nchairman of its first meeting in October 1877. Three years later he<br />\nfounded the Anierican Journal of<br />\nPhilology, a quarterly whose most<br />\nrecent issue is on A\u2014level right<br />\nnow.

It is a matter of priority and more importantly, a matter<br />\nof time.

I beleive that the Student Council made some small<br />\nheadway on these problems this<br />\nyear and we will continue, to push<br />\nto help the University realize its<br />\nfull committment to the Undergraduates in these areas.<br />\nThe issue of \"involvement\" was<br />\nalso raised during this campaign<br />\nand quite justifiably so.

I am also<br />\nwatching the girl who is asleep in my bed.<br />\nIt's very peaceful and quiet now, a time<br />\nwhen most of the immediate world has volunteered its silence and absence.

As 1 got<br />\nup, a bit chilled on the shoulders, I wanted<br />\nto cover her up, but she mumbled in her<br />\nsleep that she was too hot. It is nice and<br />\nwarm in here this morning, so I have not had<br />\nto dress. The rain is steady, the first real<br />\nspring rain we have had. The rain may be as<br />\npacifying as anything else. I expected it<br />\nwould still be raining when I woke. I anticipated nothing else, and disappointment did<br />\nnot greet me under the blanket of cloudgray<br />\nsullen shades. That suits me too. The grass<br />\nhas miraculously turned green overnight and<br />\nsoft verdant hints are tufting the swollen<br />\nnodes of branches dangling outside the<br />\nwindow. Pregnant spring.

Her toes on the<br />\nfoot sticking out wiggle occasionally as if<br />\nthey were electrically operated, and almost<br />\nmake me laugh. She is clutching a kleenex in<br />\none hand because she has a slight cold or allergy (we're not sure which) and has to clear<br />\nher nose in the night. The bottoms of her<br />\nfeet are filthy, as usual, but that did not stop<br />\nme from letting her in my bed.<br /><br />\ncontentment<br /><br />\nlit<br /><br />\nI listened to. the rain last night while trying<br /><br />\nt'o go to sleep. I was very tired and had had a<br />\nheadache all day. But I could not get to<br />\nsleep. When she finally got into bed after me,<br />\nI didnot feel like doing; the thing that helps<br />\nme go to sleep fast and sleep well. That was<br />\na consequence of the course of the night. So<br />\nwe lay there trying to ignore the gaping<br />\ndrizzly silence between us. I must have dozed<br />\noff, because when I opened my eyes she had<br />\ngotten up and was putting on her clothes. A<br />\ndisastrously' \u2022 light sleep, the slightest disturbances, even when she or I turn over at night,wakes me. I rolled over onto the center of<br />\nthe pillow and watched her try to close the<br />\ndoor quietly as she went out, supposing me<br />\nstill<br />\nMy cheek felt the damp spot<br />\nwhere her silent tears had dropped. After<br />\nthat I tried to go back to sleep, but could<br />\nnot. I just lay there listening to the rain and<br />\nwaited and was content with being able to do<br />\nthat.<br /><br />\nthe girl<br />\nShe has just turned, and now a full side of<br />\nher smooth skinned model's body is exposed,<br />\nthe front towards me. It is not perfect; she<br />\ncould stand to trim her thighs and hips, for<br /><br />\nThe Model<br />\nas a Virgin<br /><br />\n90)<br /><br />\nmy liking. I would never tell het that,<br />\nthough. Her stomach is wonderfully firm, yet<br />\nfemininFlyiarbors enough flesh above the muscles for me to sink my teeth in. It is strange<br />\nto think of myself going to bed with this girl<br />\nwho models naked for other people. Every<br />\nonce in a while I'm struck with that realization. Sometimes confronted with it. And I do<br />\nnot know whether I am going to laugh or<br />\nnot. I, too, had acquired the usual set<br />\nconceptions, obviosuly erroneous, of the type<br />\nof girl who poses without any clothes on to<br />\nbe drawn or photographed ,thoroughly scrutinized by :men's crevice-searching eyes. We<br />\nexpect a generous portion of the exotic, the<br />\nbohemiam, the flamboyant, the Isadora<br />\nDuncan to be characteristic of them. We<br />\nwant that, pry for it, something both desirably attractive and poisonously contaminating<br />\nthat leaves us in adventurous ambivalence. We<br />\nwant the freedom of spirit and from inhibition we feel they will be able to bestow upon<br />\nus, as if we were in need of psychic liberation; yet we are frightened by the prospect<br />\nof undefined artistic abandon. So it was,<br />\nwhen I first met her. I had never imagined<br />\nknowing such a girl. But when I did, the aura<br />\nof unconventionality, the exotic that I<br />\nsought, did not seem to surround either her<br />\nor her job. Disappointment. I don't even think<br />\nabout it now, much. I care less and less each<br />\nday what she is. Were I to be truthful with<br />\nmyself and her, I would probably admit that<br />\nI care less now who she is.<br /><br />\nunderwear<br />\nHer bikini underwear with pictures of strawberries and grapes and berries is lying crumpled up on the floor on her side of the bed.<br />\nShe took them off shortly after the second<br />\ntime she got into bed last night, after I had<br />\nwaited a long time for her to come back. I<br />\nknew she had not left for good because her<br />\nbag and coat were lying across this chair. She<br />\nwas gone for longer than I could keep track,<br />\nalthough I did not sleep. She must have gone<br />\nfor a walk out to the lobby, or sat quietly<br />\nout in the kitchen. I did not ask her, and I<br />\nprobably won't. When I heard her come back<br />\nin, I briefly considered pretending I was<br />\nasleep. But I rolled over and made room for<br />\nher. She took off everything except her<br />\nunderpants, and I put out my arms for her to<br />\ncrawl into. I had gone to bed with my underwear on. That is the kind of night it had<br />\nturned into by the time I undressed and got<br />\nunder the covers. We had kept talking, with<br />\nher sitting in this chair and me in bed, until<br />\nshe said that when other people did what I<br />\nhad done, she she despised them; but when I<br />\ndid what I had done, she became afraid. I<br />\nhad shut her off. Then I just shook my head<br />\nand laughed to myself and turned out the<br />\nlight. It was not a hurnourous laugh. It was<br />\nexasperation and befuddlement. My way of<br />\nescaping the pressing necessity of the situation and the response expected of me. I was<br />\nvery sorry, but I could not say anything, not<br />\na single word more. Not at two in the morning...,<br /><br />\nreminders<br />\nMy underwear is lying on the floor on the<br />\nother side of the bed. I know that a fresh<br />\ncome stain spots my sheet, probably directly<br />\nunder her soft angular butt. The come is<br />\n\u2022 dried around my hair and makes it clump<br />\ntogether in bunches. And I know if I do not<br />\nshower today I will sweat later on,and it will<br />\nget moist and sticky and fragrant, like the<br />\nsap of lilacs. I used to look forward to that<br />\nis a pleasant reminder during the day. The<br />\n3nly other reminder is the stain on my sheet,<br />\nand that will remind me of the nights she is<br />\nnot or won't be here. I shall probably shower<br />\nlater, after she leaves.<br /><br />\nan affliction<br />\nWhen she got back in I asked her did she<br />\nwant to talk now? She answered by asking<br />\ndid I? I ignored her question and waited a<br />\ncDuple of minutes, then asked again This was<br />\na concession on my part, for I was the one<br />\nwho had stopped talking. The discussion we<br />\nhad carried on up until we went to bed<br />\nhad<br />\ngotten us nowhere, so typically the case.

I<br />\ntake them and mean them as lightly as possible, and want others to, also, though some<br />\nseem to be struck to the core afterwards by<br />\nmy off-hand comments. People take me too<br />\nseriously. My saracastic defensive attacks on<br />\nevery little thing she has said upset her. I<br />\ntrapped her in word games and was downright literal until she herself was afraid to<br />\nspeak. She made the final effort before I<br />\nturned out the light to explain what I had<br />\ndone to her, for I had not clearly understood, nor been aware of my\u2014self.<br /><br />\na cure<br />\nShe is perhaps too sensitive a person for a<br />\ncynic like me. I'm not sensitive enough; I've<br />\nbeen told that. But after she explained, I saw<br />\nclearly enough what I had done to upset her.<br />\nI thought of a thousand things I could have<br />\nsaid to her then, among them that she had<br />\njust supplied proof for my theory (which she<br />\nscorns) that my own attempts at verbal communication are usually a failure and that I<br />\nshould speak as little as possible. It is a discipline: I have advocated for years, to the<br />\ndiscontent, I am not happy to say, of many<br />\npeople whom I believe would like to have<br />\ntold me more about themselves than I would<br />\ntolerate. But I was afraid that any of those<br />\nthousand things would have upset her just as<br />\nmuch. So I did not say anything, though I<br />\nknew she would not appreciate that either. It<br />\nwas too late at night. I just turned out the<br />\nlight and watched her undress and crawl into<br />\nbed where we only stared at each other in<br />\nthe adjusting darkness while the rain begah,<br />\noutside.<br /><br />\nwhat she needs<br />\nWhen I decided the end point had been<br />\nreached , decided to quit to save some remnants, she thought I was shutting her off<br />\nagain. And nothing was any closer to being<br />\nsolved. I know she needed my words, and<br />\nthat is bad:deterioration. Even worse, I did<br />\nnot want t give them. I wanted to go to<br />\nsleep, or I<br />\nted it to be the next day. It is<br />\nraining hard now suddenly, and it looks as<br />\nif she might.144,a:: ke up. I hope she does not<br />\nwake up yet, 4cause I feel very tranquil sitting here watch<br />\nher.<br /><br />\ni need<br />\nShe says that bec<br />\nI do not talk enough,<br />\nshe cannot tell wha .4,s in my )ead or if anyg is -1444 witC't*, 01,1 she is left to<br />\nss and does not ifice to guess. With her<br />\ntivity she ought to he able to tell what's<br />\ny how I have spoken the few words I<br />\nave already said. After\u2022 all, I'm not<br />\n, not voiceless. But she wants me to<br />\nsp myself for her. She said what I must<br />\nne<br />\nis a mind reader. I almost told her I<br />\nwith her. I think that would be per3gr,<br />\nrect She says she does not let me guess what<br />\nIs in her head, but she's wrong there. I could<br />\nnot tell last night. But then, I had scared ner<br />\ninto not talking after a while, and I'm so insensitive to begin with. I want hgr to sleep<br /><br />\nnow, sleep all day. If she wakes<br />\nI shall<br />\nhave to say something and break t<br />\nlovely<br />\nquietness of light rain on soft sprt grass.<br />\nWe shall be ficed with the option o-A-esum-<br /><br />\ning where:we left off last night or completely<br />\nignoring it. Too early for her to wake up<br />\nnow. She does not appreciate the morning,<br />\nanyhow.<br /><br />\nconversation<br />\nI knew she would want to talk. I knew that,<br />\nbad as it might be, any intimate susurration<br />\nin the close darkness was the best thing for<br />\nus to do when she slipped back into bed. We<br />\nfaced each other, and I held my arm around<br />\nher narrow, rib-boned back. After the second<br />\ntime I asked her, she tried to smile, and then<br />\nbegan to explain how maybe it would be better, easier for her, if she did not care so<br />\nmuch. She thought everything would be much<br />\nbetter if she just did not care, if she was not<br />\nafraid. I wanted to tell her she was right. It<br />\nwould be better. I knew. But I just could not<br />\nsay that to her; it was not the proper time to<br />\ndeal in those terms. I had known I would be<br />\nsorry we had begun talking, because I knew<br />\nit would get bad sooner or later. But she had<br />\ncome back instead of leaving in the night altogether, so there was no other course for me<br />\nto take. We both compromised. I tried to say<br />\nas little as possible. She wished she did not<br />\nworry so much, and I told myself again how<br />\nover sensitive she was. And then I became<br />\nafraid an instint as I anticipated what I<br />\nthought she would say rt'el'X' t. Silent an unnatural moment, she scared me. I was afraid she<br />\nwas going to say she was in love with me. I<br />\nwould neither agree, nor protest, nor discuss<br />\nthe matter. Not at night. Not facing each<br />\nother in bed. Three o'clock in the morning, I<br />\nhave found, is not an efficacious nor intelligent time to cope with that kind of matter.<br />\nBed is not the garden of truthhood, either. I<br />\nwould wait until daytime, the daylight, and if<br />\nthe point was pressed, would deal with it<br />\nthen. But she did not say it, and I had only<br />\nfallen prey to the egotism that secretly hoped<br />\nshe felt that way towards inc. A pathetic but<br />\nwidely appreciated condition.<br /><br />\ndiversion<br />\nI began kissing her and she was glad to respond. 1 moved against her and let her know .<br />\nWhen we were kissing we could not be talking. I said one thitig more. I asked her did<br />\nshe want to? She nodded; I detected a smile,<br />\nand we did. After we took off our underwear. I know I had done the best thing and<br />\nthat she was happier then.,<br /><br />\ndigression<br />\nA bizarre thing happened to me that I cannot<br />\nintegrate with everything else. Ic., was very<br />\nhumid in the room and under 'the covers.<br />\nThree times for her, that tension which relaxes, and biting back ,g,cstatic oral release.<br />\nThe first was the best, and I thought k could<br />\nfeel her pores open; then more and more<br />\nly after that. I was tired, but her<br />\nre ons flattered, and I enjoyed it. When I<br />\ntoo 'my turn I felt mv head get light and I<br />\nthought I was going to pass out. I think . I<br />\nhad been holding my breath, though I'm<br />\nnot<br />\nSure how long Iliad. I had to stop. And then<br />\nI fell asleep with my face in her hair. When<br />\nI<br />\nrolled off I felt as if I had been punched in<br />\nthe stomach, and she got us a glass of water.<br />\nI guess I had not been feeling well.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nsupposition<br />\nI did not sleep well last night either. It got<br />\nlight out and in before I knew it. I have gotten up early and am not surprised the rain<br />\ncontinues to fall. I feel calm and still, though<br /><br />\nnot very energetic, and I have nothing to do<br />\ntoday but sit here. She will sleep for a long<br />\nwhile yet, not capable of enjoying a rainy<br />\nmorning. I do not think I would want her to<br />\nbe. She likes to talk too much. She likes to<br />\nsleep and if she had her way would probably<br />\nsleep all day, waking as the sun sets. When<br />\nshe does wake we shall probably both pretend everything is all right, that somehow<br />\nthings worked themselves out in our sleep, or<br />\nin our physical and mock-passionate denial of<br />\nthe perplexities between us, which are my<br />\nduty now to equilibrate. Of that in the dark,<br />\nthings were legitimately obscure and doubtful, and the daylight will clarify everything.<br />\nAt least I did not catch her actually crying she did not break down in front of me. I do<br />\nnot know what she did or where she went<br />\nwhen she got up. And I will ignore it, not<br />\nmention it today. If she had begun audibly<br />\ncrying in front of me, I may have succumbed<br />\nto anything she said or did. I cannot cope<br />\nwith a woman crying, least of all in my bed<br />\nat night.<br /><br />\nthe model<br />\nShe will model this afternoon. She likes to<br />\nbelieve that her modeling has nothing to do<br />\nwith virginity. But one time I cornered her<br />\ninto .admitting that were she a fully intact<br />\nvirgin, she would not be so ready to disrobe<br />\nfor any kind of audience. Virginity is a matter of degree, I am sure; relative. I have supposed, to amuse myself, an inversely proportional relationship between the quantity of<br />\nher remaining virginity and the amount of<br />\nmodeling she has done. She must have pockets of it, veins of it. Maybe those I am trying<br />\nto mine and expose. Only to plunder. Because I cannot draw, am not an artist, I must<br />\nrelieve the other side of the scale and do my<br />\npart to serve the proportional balance. Yet<br />\nwhatever virginity she came to me with I<br />\nhave not been able to touch, nor eradicate,<br />\nnor diminish. She is just as whole. There has<br />\nto be some left. Somewhere untouched.<br />\nThough she goes on modeling, I am still<br />\nsearching. I am also deliberately complicating<br />\nher, posing explanations for my continued involvement.<br /><br />\nthe virgin<br />\nNow she has rolled over on her other side.<br />\nShe breathes with her mouth open, lips<br />\nslightly parted because of an incomplete overbite. She has got several hours of sleep to go.<br />\nHer large breasts are squashed between her<br />\narms, her hands pulled up under her chin,<br />\nand she looks childlike. In a few hours she<br />\nwill get up and go model. They should come<br />\nand draw her now, the way she is asleep.<br />\nThere it is : the virginity she yet has must be<br />\nmanifest only in her sleep, and I would like<br />\nto see an artist able to capture it forever.<br />\nhave no idea how long it will last by itself.<br />\nAnd after all, how often do they get a virgin<br />\nto model for them. She is actually pretty<br />\nwhen she is quiet, and I would like to make<br />\nlove with her right now. But that would only<br />\nwake her.<br /><br />\nthe forecast<br />\nI shall have to sit here until she wakes, and<br />\nthat will content me. But when she does<br />\nwake I shall have to think of something to<br />\nsay. She will blink and try to smile, maybe<br />\nfrown out the window and ask what time it<br />\nis. She will probably ask me how I slept, how<br />\nlong I have been up, and what I have been<br />\ndoing. And I shall probably say: pretty well:<br />\na few minutes; just watching you.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40767, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "b1014b14-7be2-4e5c-a3e2-17ff02e47f08", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14166-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14166, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "bb2436ed-921f-466d-91e7-46587777ec91", "url": "/node/14166"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "f8303962-cd4a-448b-9968-4c845e4b14e2"}]}
