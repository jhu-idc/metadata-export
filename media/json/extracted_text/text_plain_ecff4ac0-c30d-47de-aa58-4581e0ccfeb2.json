She is a full-blooded Ogallala<br />\nSioux and holds the world's shot put record. The little<br />\nwoman I referred to is someone we found crouching under<br />\nthe sofa when we moved into our apartment back in 1928,<br />\nand there she has remained ever since.

To get back to tests\u2014sure, they're important, but let's not allow them to get too important. There<br />\nare, after all, many talents which simply can't be measured<br />\nby quizzes.

He can, for example, sleep<br />\nstanding up. He can do a perfect imitation of a scarlet tanager. (I don't mean just the bird calls; I mean he can fly<br />\nsouth in the winter.) He can pick up BB's with his toes. He<br />\ncan say \"toy boat\" three times fast. He can build a rude<br />\ntelephone out of 100 yards of string and two empty Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blade packages. (This last accomplishment is the one Finster is proudest of\u2014not building<br />\nthe telephone but emptying the Personna packs.
