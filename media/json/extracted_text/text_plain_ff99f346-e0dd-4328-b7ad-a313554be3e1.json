It asks<br />\nmuch from the individual and<br />\noffers him insecurity far greater<br />\ntl)an were he to live under a<br />\nproctor system. The system demands responsibility and character. It is this which makes us<br />\nproud. Yet it owes to us, the<br />\nmembers of the community, an<br />\nobligation to function as effectively as possible. This is the<br />\nCommission's job. Before we<br />\nmake a change, let us weigh the<br />\nimpact of our decision very carefully.<br />\n<br />\nBy ALLAN GRAF<br />\nThe Honor System is one of<br />\nthe oldest traditions of Hopkins,<br />\nfunctioning to set the rules of<br />\nfair academic competition. Any<br />\nlegal system must be founded<br />\nupon the general acceptance of<br />\nthe community. If the cooperation of the community is not<br />\nforthcoming; or if there is widespread disagreement or indifference to the law, then the legal<br />\nsystem will collapse. This proposition is true for the American<br />\nlegal system as well as Hopikns'<br />\nHonor System.<br />\nOne of the principal purposes<br />\nof the Honor Commission is to<br />\nsecure the cooperation of students and faculty in adherence<br />\nto the Honor System. Many times<br />\nin the past, the Honor Commission has been accused of neglecting this vital purpose. But the<br />\nHonor Commission is deeply concerned about student attitudes<br />\ntoward the Honor System. To<br />\nthis end, the Honor Commission<br />\nis opening up to public review<br />\nthe most pressing problems confronting the Honor System today.<br />\nThe purpose is to generate awareness on the part of the members<br />\nof the Hopkins Community of the<br />\nimportant issues facing us so<br />\nthat we may be called upon to<br />\nmake the vital decisions concerning the possible new directions of the Honor System.<br />\nNot a Police Force<br />\nThe most controversial issue<br />\nconcerns the present relationship<br />\nof an accuser to his accused. The<br />\nHonor System is a voluntary,<br />\nself-enforcing system; and the<br />\nmembers of the community are<br />\ngiven the responsibility for the<br />\nenforcement of the rules of the<br />\ngame. The Honor Commission's<br />\nfunctions are strictly limited to<br />\nthe investigation of reported violations and the determination of<br />\ntheir validity. The Honor Commission is no police force set up<br />\nto catch suspected violators.<br />\nThat function must be exercised<br />\nsolely by the members of the<br />\ncommunity. If the community is<br />\nunwilling to report suspected violations, then Hopkins must accept the de facto end of the<br />\nHonor System.<br />\nAmong many members of the<br />\nCommission, there has been sufficient disquiet whether the present system of no confrontation<br />\nbetween accuser and accused is<br />\nindeed the best system.

The committee's principal recommendation was that the accuser, the<br />\naccused, and the principal witnesses should confront each<br />\nother and relate testimony in<br />\neach other's presence during a<br />\ntrial.<br />\nOn the one hand, it is contended that student cooperation cannot be secured unless the maximum number of violators are<br />\nturned in. Without the accuser's<br />\nidentity being protected, more<br />\nviolations will go unreported.<br />\nThe students thus lose faith in<br />\nthe Honor System. The argument<br />\nfor open confrontation, on the<br />\nother hand, is based upon the<br />\nmore ideal interpretations of the<br />\nHonor System. It is argued that<br />\nthe Commission must not be allowed solely to function in ways<br />\nwhich are designed to get the<br />\nmaximum number of violations<br />\nreported. The Commission has<br />\nother more important duties and<br />\nobligations to the System. Getting the largest number of accusations is not the purpose of the<br />\nHonor Commission.<br />\nHeavy Responsibility<br />\nThe burden of turning in accu<br />\nsations rests solely on the Community. The Commission's only<br />\nfunction is to determine the<br />\nvalidity of those allegations.<br />\nThus the Commission has a special responsibility to ensure that<br />\nit employs the best methods and<br />\nprocedures to get at the \"truth\"<br />\nof a case. This is no game, and<br />\nthe findings of a Commission's<br />\ntrial panel represents a very real<br />\npower over the academic careers<br />\nand futures of all students. The<br />\nfirst responsibility of the Honor<br />\nCommission is to protect the<br />\n<br />\nright of all the members of the<br />\nCommunity to have all accusations evaluated by the best possible methods.<br />\nOpen confrontation of accused,<br />\naccuser, and all principal witnesses would allow the accused<br />\nto be completely informed of all<br />\nthe evidence for and against him.<br />\nPresently, he receives only partial information from his defense<br />\ncounsel. But for all witnesses to<br />\ntestify insulated from the various<br />\ntestimonies makes the search for<br />\nthe truth that much more precarious. Memories may be refreshed in open confrontation or<br />\nnew connections and possibilities<br />\nbrought to light. But most importantly, witnesses will be<br />\nforced to resolve the conflicts of<br />\ntestimony themselves instead of<br />\nthe trial panel alone trying to<br />\ntwist the several versions into a<br />\ncoherent story.<br />\nRight of Accused<br />\nAnd what of the rights of an<br />\naccused?

BOND<br />\nLast week California's new<br />\ngovernor blew out 56 candles on<br />\nhis birthday cake which had been<br />\nfrosted with a 10% slice of the<br />\ncake missing. Ronald Reagan's<br />\n\"economy\" cake made the point<br />\nobvious: his administration is<br />\ngoing to cut and trim California's<br />\ndeficit-ridden $4.6 billion budget<br />\nuntil expenditures come back into balance with revenues.<br />\nReagan's apparent concern for<br />\nredefining and redirecting \"state<br />\nresponsibilities\" is no doubt well<br />\nIntended. Indeed, this very same<br />\nconcern is shared by the other<br />\nnew-breed Republican governors<br />\nelected last November. But while<br />\nmen like Oregon's Tom McCall,<br />\nNevada's Paul Laxalt, and Maryland's own Ted Agnew have declared higher budgets (often accompanied by cries for state income tax hikes), Reagan has<br />\nmade an about face.<br />\nThe recent performance of his<br />\nalready battle-scared achninisibration is making party regulars<br />\nWonder if Reagan's \"fresh air of<br />\ncommon sense thinking\" isn't<br />\nteally polluted with ignorance<br />\n<br />\nand a fanatical desire to fulfill<br />\ncampaign promises. Nevertheless,<br />\nlooking at Reagan as Governor<br />\nof California instead of as a GOP<br />\nnational luminary, there is, in<br />\nmy judgment, a strong case in<br />\ndefense of Reagan's policies.<br />\nWay To Do<br />\nPerhaps the most valid complaint against Reagan Is not<br />\nwhat he has done, but rather the<br />\nway he has done it. His blatant<br />\nannouncement that \"there is no<br />\nsuch thing as free education,\"<br />\nwas no less than tragic to those<br />\nwho have revered California's<br />\ntuition-free university tradition,<br />\nand those students, professors,<br />\nand others who justifiably believe in providing an equal opportunity for all to gain a higher<br />\neducation. Then the Regents'<br />\nabrupt dismissal of University of<br />\nCalifornia President Clark Kerr<br />\nless than a week later proved a<br />\nreckless faux pas for Reagan,<br />\nfor it gained him the unhealthy<br />\nreputation of political tampering<br />\nInto university affairs. And finally, Reagan's suggestion two weeks<br />\nlater that state employees work<br />\nvoluntarily without salary on<br />\n<br />\nEngineers:<br />\n<br />\nMeet<br />\nBoeing<br />\n<br />\nhis \"contract\" in a conservative<br />\ncontext. Thus he will be much<br />\nmore comfortable if he can<br />\nachieve a balanced state budget.<br />\nBy imposing tuition on students<br />\nand trimming the higher education budget he will save the state,<br />\n$108 million annually (more than<br />\none-quarter of the annual $400<br />\nmillion deficit). But imposing<br />\ntuition will no doubt make General Hershey drool at the Prospect of drafting some of the 22,500 potential students who would<br />\nbe barred from college due to<br />\ntuition, as reported by Dr. Kerr.<br />\nOn the other hand, the tuition,<br />\nif passed by the state legislature,<br />\nwould have the long-range effect<br />\nof helping to balance the budget,<br />\nand, more important, may force<br />\nCalifornia's state colleges and<br />\nthe University to hand out the<br />\nannual $2000 per student scholarship (the cost of \"free\" education in California) on a selective basis of financial need rather than to everyone (both rich<br />\nand poor) who enrolls in the<br />\nsystem of higher education. Put<br />\ninto practice, this latter point<br />\ncould finance the education of<br />\nthe deprived 22,500.<br />\nAs far as taxes are concerned,<br />\nReagan's proposed broadening of<br />\nthe general sales tax and excise<br />\ntaxes on liquor and tobacco is<br />\nanything but progressive. However, a bigger sales tax implies<br />\nCalifornia's mammoth tour* * * * * * * * that<br />\nist industry will contribute a<br />\nbigger part to state revenues.<br />\nAnd considering that property<br />\n\"Sour Beef, Spaghetti, Sand- taxes have risen 169% in the past<br />\nten<br />\nan increase in income<br />\nwiches and Pizza, get 'ern taxesyears,<br />\n(which would strike hardfront Harry Little, and no- est at property owners) might<br />\nantagonize the electorate which<br />\nbody beats yet.\"<br />\nis expecting a de-escalated state<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nRegardless of his national<br />\nSubmarines \u2022 Pizza<br />\nstanding, Reagan still looks good<br />\nfor California. He would make<br />\nSpaghetti \u2022 Sour Beef<br />\nhis state join 48 others by insisting that students pay a fair<br />\nshare of their education. He includes less government and fiscal<br />\nresponsibility in the form of a<br />\nCARRY OUT SHOPS<br />\nbalanced budget as part of defining \"state responsibilities.\"<br />\nWhat is more, Reagan is de* * * * * * * * cidedly Republican<br />\nrather than<br />\nconservative: he applies conserRx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx<br />\nvatism to his pragmatism, not<br />\nvice versa. Perhaps as his adminFor the Weekend<br />\nistration settles down for the<br />\nlong four year haul, Governor<br />\nAFTER SHAVES<br />\nReagan will also improve his tact<br />\nAND COLOGNES<br />\nX and employ more finesse in<br />\nthe<br />\nJade East<br />\nart of government.<br />\nWashington's and Lincol n's<br />\nbirthdays in order to save $7<br />\nmillion sounded ridiculous if not<br />\namateurish.<br />\nThese untimely and tactless<br />\nmaneuvers have prompted historian Arthur Schlesinger to<br />\ncomment that Reagan \"has<br />\neliminated himself from national<br />\npolitics.\" This may be so, but it<br />\ndoes not imply that Reagan is<br />\nnot a good governor as far as<br />\nCalifornians are concerned. Last<br />\nDecember at the Governors' Association meeting in Colorado<br />\nSprings, Reagan stated: \"I have<br />\nmade a contract with the people<br />\nof California.\" At the risk of incurring<br />\nunfavorable national<br />\nsentiment, he is trying to stick<br />\nto his contract by the letter.<br />\n52% Favor<br />\nAnd at home where it counts,<br />\nthe California Poll reports that<br />\n52% of the voters favor his proposed 20% cut in the state higher<br />\neducation budget, while 51%<br />\nfavor making students pay tuition. Though these percentages<br />\nseem hardly favorable, neither<br />\nare they alarming, for just four<br />\nshort years ago 44% of the voters<br />\nchose to give Pat Brown a third<br />\nberm in Sacramento.<br />\nIt must also be remembered<br />\nthat Reagan, though no idealogue like Barry Goldwater, is a<br />\nconservative: he is interpreting<br />\n<br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nEnglish Leather<br />\nYardley<br />\nOld Spice<br />\n<br />\nWe need your head in our<br />\nbusiness<br />\n<br />\nGreenway Pharmacy<br />\n<br />\nSt. Paul Barber Shop<br />\n<br />\nCharles and 34th<br />\n<br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\nAcross from Eddie'.<br />\n<br />\nRx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx<br />\n<br />\nMatmen<br />\nAt Towson<br />\n(Continued from Page 12)<br />\nhistory, was completely outwrestled by the score of 11-1,<br />\nMonte Ikemire lost a very close<br />\nmatch 6-4.<br />\nJohn Peck, returning to the<br />\n160 pound weight class after a<br />\nlong period of inactivity caused<br />\nby an injury, suffered a close defeat 1-3 on riding time.

It asks<br />\nmuch from the individual and<br />\noffers him insecurity far greater<br />\ntl)an were he to live under a<br />\nproctor system. The system demands responsibility and character. It is this which makes us<br />\nproud. Yet it owes to us, the<br />\nmembers of the community, an<br />\nobligation to function as effectively as possible. This is the<br />\nCommission's job. Before we<br />\nmake a change, let us weigh the<br />\nimpact of our decision very carefully.<br /><br />\nBy ALLAN GRAF<br />\nThe Honor System is one of<br />\nthe oldest traditions of Hopkins,<br />\nfunctioning to set the rules of<br />\nfair academic competition. Any<br />\nlegal system must be founded<br />\nupon the general acceptance of<br />\nthe community. If the cooperation of the community is not<br />\nforthcoming; or if there is widespread disagreement or indifference to the law, then the legal<br />\nsystem will collapse. This proposition is true for the American<br />\nlegal system as well as Hopikns'<br />\nHonor System.<br />\nOne of the principal purposes<br />\nof the Honor Commission is to<br />\nsecure the cooperation of students and faculty in adherence<br />\nto the Honor System. Many times<br />\nin the past, the Honor Commission has been accused of neglecting this vital purpose. But the<br />\nHonor Commission is deeply concerned about student attitudes<br />\ntoward the Honor System. To<br />\nthis end, the Honor Commission<br />\nis opening up to public review<br />\nthe most pressing problems confronting the Honor System today.<br />\nThe purpose is to generate awareness on the part of the members<br />\nof the Hopkins Community of the<br />\nimportant issues facing us so<br />\nthat we may be called upon to<br />\nmake the vital decisions concerning the possible new directions of the Honor System.<br />\nNot a Police Force<br />\nThe most controversial issue<br />\nconcerns the present relationship<br />\nof an accuser to his accused. The<br />\nHonor System is a voluntary,<br />\nself-enforcing system; and the<br />\nmembers of the community are<br />\ngiven the responsibility for the<br />\nenforcement of the rules of the<br />\ngame. The Honor Commission's<br />\nfunctions are strictly limited to<br />\nthe investigation of reported violations and the determination of<br />\ntheir validity. The Honor Commission is no police force set up<br />\nto catch suspected violators.<br />\nThat function must be exercised<br />\nsolely by the members of the<br />\ncommunity. If the community is<br />\nunwilling to report suspected violations, then Hopkins must accept the de facto end of the<br />\nHonor System.<br />\nAmong many members of the<br />\nCommission, there has been sufficient disquiet whether the present system of no confrontation<br />\nbetween accuser and accused is<br />\nindeed the best system. A special<br />\ncommittee assigned to study the<br /><br />\n\"WHAT A BUNCH OF pompous, humorless, self-righteous bigots, these ideologues!

The committee's principal recommendation was that the accuser, the<br />\naccused, and the principal witnesses should confront each<br />\nother and relate testimony in<br />\neach other's presence during a<br />\ntrial.<br />\nOn the one hand, it is contended that student cooperation cannot be secured unless the maximum number of violators are<br />\nturned in. Without the accuser's<br />\nidentity being protected, more<br />\nviolations will go unreported.<br />\nThe students thus lose faith in<br />\nthe Honor System. The argument<br />\nfor open confrontation, on the<br />\nother hand, is based upon the<br />\nmore ideal interpretations of the<br />\nHonor System. It is argued that<br />\nthe Commission must not be allowed solely to function in ways<br />\nwhich are designed to get the<br />\nmaximum number of violations<br />\nreported. The Commission has<br />\nother more important duties and<br />\nobligations to the System. Getting the largest number of accusations is not the purpose of the<br />\nHonor Commission.<br />\nHeavy Responsibility<br />\nThe burden of turning in accu<br />\nsations rests solely on the Community. The Commission's only<br />\nfunction is to determine the<br />\nvalidity of those allegations.<br />\nThus the Commission has a special responsibility to ensure that<br />\nit employs the best methods and<br />\nprocedures to get at the \"truth\"<br />\nof a case. This is no game, and<br />\nthe findings of a Commission's<br />\ntrial panel represents a very real<br />\npower over the academic careers<br />\nand futures of all students. The<br />\nfirst responsibility of the Honor<br />\nCommission is to protect the<br /><br />\nright of all the members of the<br />\nCommunity to have all accusations evaluated by the best possible methods.<br />\nOpen confrontation of accused,<br />\naccuser, and all principal witnesses would allow the accused<br />\nto be completely informed of all<br />\nthe evidence for and against him.<br />\nPresently, he receives only partial information from his defense<br />\ncounsel. But for all witnesses to<br />\ntestify insulated from the various<br />\ntestimonies makes the search for<br />\nthe truth that much more precarious. Memories may be refreshed in open confrontation or<br />\nnew connections and possibilities<br />\nbrought to light. But most importantly, witnesses will be<br />\nforced to resolve the conflicts of<br />\ntestimony themselves instead of<br />\nthe trial panel alone trying to<br />\ntwist the several versions into a<br />\ncoherent story.<br />\nRight of Accused<br />\nAnd what of the rights of an<br />\naccused?

BOND<br />\nLast week California's new<br />\ngovernor blew out 56 candles on<br />\nhis birthday cake which had been<br />\nfrosted with a 10% slice of the<br />\ncake missing. Ronald Reagan's<br />\n\"economy\" cake made the point<br />\nobvious: his administration is<br />\ngoing to cut and trim California's<br />\ndeficit-ridden $4.6 billion budget<br />\nuntil expenditures come back into balance with revenues.<br />\nReagan's apparent concern for<br />\nredefining and redirecting \"state<br />\nresponsibilities\" is no doubt well<br />\nIntended. Indeed, this very same<br />\nconcern is shared by the other<br />\nnew-breed Republican governors<br />\nelected last November. But while<br />\nmen like Oregon's Tom McCall,<br />\nNevada's Paul Laxalt, and Maryland's own Ted Agnew have declared higher budgets (often accompanied by cries for state income tax hikes), Reagan has<br />\nmade an about face.<br />\nThe recent performance of his<br />\nalready battle-scared achninisibration is making party regulars<br />\nWonder if Reagan's \"fresh air of<br />\ncommon sense thinking\" isn't<br />\nteally polluted with ignorance<br /><br />\nand a fanatical desire to fulfill<br />\ncampaign promises. Nevertheless,<br />\nlooking at Reagan as Governor<br />\nof California instead of as a GOP<br />\nnational luminary, there is, in<br />\nmy judgment, a strong case in<br />\ndefense of Reagan's policies.<br />\nWay To Do<br />\nPerhaps the most valid complaint against Reagan Is not<br />\nwhat he has done, but rather the<br />\nway he has done it. His blatant<br />\nannouncement that \"there is no<br />\nsuch thing as free education,\"<br />\nwas no less than tragic to those<br />\nwho have revered California's<br />\ntuition-free university tradition,<br />\nand those students, professors,<br />\nand others who justifiably believe in providing an equal opportunity for all to gain a higher<br />\neducation. Then the Regents'<br />\nabrupt dismissal of University of<br />\nCalifornia President Clark Kerr<br />\nless than a week later proved a<br />\nreckless faux pas for Reagan,<br />\nfor it gained him the unhealthy<br />\nreputation of political tampering<br />\nInto university affairs. And finally, Reagan's suggestion two weeks<br />\nlater that state employees work<br />\nvoluntarily without salary on<br /><br />\nEngineers:<br /><br />\nMeet<br />\nBoeing<br /><br />\nhis \"contract\" in a conservative<br />\ncontext. Thus he will be much<br />\nmore comfortable if he can<br />\nachieve a balanced state budget.<br />\nBy imposing tuition on students<br />\nand trimming the higher education budget he will save the state,<br />\n$108 million annually (more than<br />\none-quarter of the annual $400<br />\nmillion deficit). But imposing<br />\ntuition will no doubt make General Hershey drool at the Prospect of drafting some of the 22,500 potential students who would<br />\nbe barred from college due to<br />\ntuition, as reported by Dr. Kerr.<br />\nOn the other hand, the tuition,<br />\nif passed by the state legislature,<br />\nwould have the long-range effect<br />\nof helping to balance the budget,<br />\nand, more important, may force<br />\nCalifornia's state colleges and<br />\nthe University to hand out the<br />\nannual $2000 per student scholarship (the cost of \"free\" education in California) on a selective basis of financial need rather than to everyone (both rich<br />\nand poor) who enrolls in the<br />\nsystem of higher education. Put<br />\ninto practice, this latter point<br />\ncould finance the education of<br />\nthe deprived 22,500.<br />\nAs far as taxes are concerned,<br />\nReagan's proposed broadening of<br />\nthe general sales tax and excise<br />\ntaxes on liquor and tobacco is<br />\nanything but progressive. However, a bigger sales tax implies<br />\nCalifornia's mammoth tour* * * * * * * * that<br />\nist industry will contribute a<br />\nbigger part to state revenues.<br />\nAnd considering that property<br />\n\"Sour Beef, Spaghetti, Sand- taxes have risen 169% in the past<br />\nten<br />\nan increase in income<br />\nwiches and Pizza, get 'ern taxesyears,<br />\n(which would strike hardfront Harry Little, and no- est at property owners) might<br />\nantagonize the electorate which<br />\nbody beats yet.\"<br />\nis expecting a de-escalated state<br />\ngovernment.<br />\nRegardless of his national<br />\nSubmarines \u2022 Pizza<br />\nstanding, Reagan still looks good<br />\nfor California. He would make<br />\nSpaghetti \u2022 Sour Beef<br />\nhis state join 48 others by insisting that students pay a fair<br />\nshare of their education. He includes less government and fiscal<br />\nresponsibility in the form of a<br />\nCARRY OUT SHOPS<br />\nbalanced budget as part of defining \"state responsibilities.\"<br />\nWhat is more, Reagan is de* * * * * * * * cidedly Republican<br />\nrather than<br />\nconservative: he applies conserRx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx<br />\nvatism to his pragmatism, not<br />\nvice versa. Perhaps as his adminFor the Weekend<br />\nistration settles down for the<br />\nlong four year haul, Governor<br />\nAFTER SHAVES<br />\nReagan will also improve his tact<br />\nAND COLOGNES<br />\nX and employ more finesse in<br />\nthe<br />\nJade East<br />\nart of government.<br />\nWashington's and Lincol n's<br />\nbirthdays in order to save $7<br />\nmillion sounded ridiculous if not<br />\namateurish.<br />\nThese untimely and tactless<br />\nmaneuvers have prompted historian Arthur Schlesinger to<br />\ncomment that Reagan \"has<br />\neliminated himself from national<br />\npolitics.\" This may be so, but it<br />\ndoes not imply that Reagan is<br />\nnot a good governor as far as<br />\nCalifornians are concerned. Last<br />\nDecember at the Governors' Association meeting in Colorado<br />\nSprings, Reagan stated: \"I have<br />\nmade a contract with the people<br />\nof California.\" At the risk of incurring<br />\nunfavorable national<br />\nsentiment, he is trying to stick<br />\nto his contract by the letter.<br />\n52% Favor<br />\nAnd at home where it counts,<br />\nthe California Poll reports that<br />\n52% of the voters favor his proposed 20% cut in the state higher<br />\neducation budget, while 51%<br />\nfavor making students pay tuition. Though these percentages<br />\nseem hardly favorable, neither<br />\nare they alarming, for just four<br />\nshort years ago 44% of the voters<br />\nchose to give Pat Brown a third<br />\nberm in Sacramento.<br />\nIt must also be remembered<br />\nthat Reagan, though no idealogue like Barry Goldwater, is a<br />\nconservative: he is interpreting<br /><br />\nHARRY LITTLE<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nEnglish Leather<br />\nYardley<br />\nOld Spice<br /><br />\nWe need your head in our<br />\nbusiness<br /><br />\nGreenway Pharmacy<br /><br />\nSt. Paul Barber Shop<br /><br />\nCharles and 34th<br /><br />\n3120 St. Paul St.<br />\nAcross from Eddie'.<br /><br />\nRx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx Rx<br /><br />\nMatmen<br />\nAt Towson<br />\n(Continued from Page 12)<br />\nhistory, was completely outwrestled by the score of 11-1,<br />\nMonte Ikemire lost a very close<br />\nmatch 6-4.<br />\nJohn Peck, returning to the<br />\n160 pound weight class after a<br />\nlong period of inactivity caused<br />\nby an injury, suffered a close defeat 1-3 on riding time.

Last year's Injuryplagued and not-too-successful<br />\nseason may also be forgotten, for<br />\nin the words of many, \"This is<br />\nthe year.\"<br />\nThe return of last year's injured stickmen, few losses due to<br />\ngraduation, a powerful group of<br />\nenthusiastic sophomores, and<br />\npre-season workouts figure to<br />\nmake the Jay squad one of the<br />\nbest in recent years. Injuries,<br />\nwhich were the main cause of the<br />\ndisappointing season last year,<br />\nweigh in as perhaps the biggest<br />\nquestion mark to the success of<br />\nthe 1967 campaign.<br />\nEarly preparations<br />\nLast fall Coach Bob Scott instituted pre-season lacrosse practice sessions for the first time<br />\nsince 1948.

Only five players<br />\nwere lost last year via graduation, but among them were the<br />\nstandouts Lucky Mallonee, Steve<br />\nLevy, and Mike Oidick.
