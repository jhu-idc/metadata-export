This was done to encourage real, honest efforts to make good literature, for there is<br />\nno reason why Hopkins men cannot write<br />\nverses and stories, if they only take enough<br />\ninterest in their own literary development and<br />\nIn giving to others about them their very best<br />\nthoughts. Everyone\u2014a student especially\u2014<br />\nneeds to train himself in the art of translating<br />\nthoughts into words. One may argue that<br />\nhe can think of nothing to write. But all of us<br />\nhave at divers and sundry times amorphous<br />\nimaginings and incoherent thoughts which<br />\nwould take a definite shape, so that we ourselves, and perhaps others, too, might profit by<br />\nthem,if we did but undertake earnestly the task<br />\nof putting them in words. We come to Hopkins to be trained to think ; we should take<br />\ncare while here not to neglect to train ourselves to express our thoughts. College training is too apt, we fear, to produce \"critics,\"<br />\nbut what we need is men of action. Youth is<br />\nthe time of action. We hope, then, that the<br />\npublication of the successful poems will not be<br />\nthe end of literary efforts among the student<br />\nbody, but that others may still continue their<br />\nefforts, though, perhaps, they did not gain the<br />\nprize in the present case.<br />\nSince two of the poems have been deemed<br />\nworthy of prizes by the committee, the $10 offered will be divided equally between the two<br />\nsuccessful competitors, whose names are<br />\nRoger Griswold Perkins (norn de plume, Oliver<br />\nWolcott); poem, \"Voices of the Woods;\" and<br />\nCarol Wight (nom de plume, Petrarch), poem,<br />\n\"Farewell.\"<br />\nMr. Perkins is a senior at the Medical School<br />\nand was graduated with the degree of A.

SHERWOOD ON \"BERLIN.\"<br />\n<br />\nProfessor Sherwood delivered an address<br />\nbefore the Historical and Political Science Association on Friday evening. \"Berlin\" was<br />\nthe subject he discussed, and his talk was based<br />\nUpon reminiscences of a short stop in that city<br />\nlast summer. Professor Sherwood expressed<br />\nhis disappointment with the famous boulevard,<br />\nUnter den Linden. It is true, the street is<br />\nabout two hundred feet wide, and has its sides<br />\nadorned with rows of horse-chestnut trees and<br />\nlindens, though the latter are of rather a languishing nature.<br />\nIn spite of several old ruins and crumbling<br />\ncastles of historic interest, Berlin impresses<br />\none as being a modern city. The houses are<br />\nbuilt of brick and stone, and are almost entirely of a modern origin. The municipal government of Berlin is the pride of its inhabitants, and with much justice,for it is one of the<br />\nbest governed cities in the world. In fact, the<br />\nofficials seem to carry their measures for cleanliness, etc., almost to an extreme. During the<br />\nsix weeks in which Professor Sherwood stayed<br />\nin the city it rained nearly every day; still the<br />\ngalas between were busily occupied by the<br />\nwater sprinklers.<br />\nOne of the most serious problems which<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nconfront the young men of the city is how to<br />\nmake their moustaches grow in a way they<br />\n\"hadn't orter.\" Hours are spent by the young<br />\ngallants of the city in barber shops, where tedious efforts are made to force the ends of the<br />\nmoustaches to take that much-desired upward<br />\nmovement. Although Berlin is one of the<br />\nlargest cities in Europe, yet it does not give<br />\none the impression of being a metropolis; especially is this fact brought out by the nature of<br />\nthe newspapers, which are distinctly provincial<br />\nin character. Berlin is a great business centre,<br />\nbut appearances are deceptive. Almost the<br />\nonly signs of vigorous activity in the business<br />\nworld are shown by the cabmen, who seem to<br />\nbe possessed of a mania to run down and ride<br />\nover everything in sight. Professor Sherwood<br />\nfound that it was not worth one's life to criticise the Emperor, though a considerable<br />\namount of caution was usually employed in exercising that right.<br />\nThe universities of Berlin have long been<br />\nfamous, and students from all lands may be<br />\nfound within their halls.<br />\nCAPITAL PUNISHI1ENT.<br />\n<br />\nStatistics and Bible quotations were the favorite weapons of the speakers on the question<br />\nwhether capital punishment should be abolished, which was discussed in the last session of<br />\nthe Senate. The affirmative side won the debate. Those who took part, for the affirmative,<br />\nwere Senators Dohme, Hubner and Hodges.<br />\nThose on the negative side were Senators Robinson, F. Smith and Brent. Senators Ballard<br />\nand Pender, who took part in the open debate,<br />\nshowed that both these methods of argument<br />\ncan be used to prove either yea or nay, and<br />\nthat with them but little can be accomplished.<br />\nA short, humane plea, put forth by Senator<br />\nR. D. Miller, turned the tables against the adherents of rapid methods. The whole house<br />\nshowed great interest in the progress and result of the debate.<br />\nThe Senate will meet again on January 12,<br />\n1898, when Senators Gordon, Francis and Peters will speak for the annexation of Hawaii.<br />\nSenators M.

Since the authorities have provided proper accommodations, they may reasonably require students to use them.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that they will make physical<br />\nculture, in its place, just as important as laboratory work. The man of whom it is required<br />\nshould be made to feel that the requirement<br />\nmeans something; that his attendance will be<br />\nmarked and his absence noted. We question<br />\nwhether the compulsion might not well be extended to all undergraduates instead of freshmen alone, as heretofore. We should grumble<br />\nsomewhat, no doubt, as we do now at some<br />\nother things, but at the end of the course we<br />\nshould be grateful. The College Congress bids<br />\nfair to be successful, where other plans failed,<br />\nbecause it has been made a part of the course<br />\nand attendance is required. The same may be<br />\nfound true of gymnasium classes. For the<br />\nbusy student regular exercise is a matter in<br />\nwhich the spirit is willing, but the flesh is often<br />\nvery weak.<br />\n<br />\nPHYSICAL TRAININO,<br />\n<br />\nThe new gymnasium and cage are almost<br />\ncompleted, and in a short time presumably<br />\nthey will be thrown open to the students. This<br />\nshould give a new impulse to all branches of<br />\nathletics. Candidates for the teams will devote themselves to practice. Many will moralize about the value of systematic exercise, and<br />\nwill begin to use the apparatus diligently. The<br />\nnovelty will speedily wear off, the work will<br />\nbecome irksome and they will give it up. Interest will fail, and we may find ourselves, with<br />\na new gymnasium and the largest cage in the<br />\ncountry in just the same position in regard to<br />\nathletics as before. We are confident, however,that this will not be so, for we believe that<br />\nthe businesslike management that marks the<br />\nUniversity in other departments will prevail<br />\nlikewise in the gymnasium. Last year physical culture, as a part of the course, existed<br />\nchiefly on the class books. Those of us who<br />\nremember our frequent dashes in scanty apparel between the barnlike gymnasium and inadequate bathroom on the ground floor, and<br />\nour lockers close under the roof of an adjoin-<br />\n<br />\nHAZING AT W. C. B.<br />\n<br />\nWe learn from reliable sources that the<br />\nsophomores of the Woman's College have actually been reprimanded for hazing the freshmen. It must be explained, however, that it is<br />\nnot the rough-and-tumble, pot-social variety<br />\nwith which we are familiar. At one time, we<br />\nare told, they presented the freshmen with<br />\nsticks of candy tied with green ribbons. Again<br />\nthey mingled the bray of horns with the sweet<br />\nstrains of freshmen concerts, and cut the jaunty<br />\ntassels from freshmen caps. We are surprised<br />\nand pained. After the Dean has persuaded<br />\nus to give up matriculation hazing, and the<br />\nfreshmen and juniors have lived in peace for<br />\nthree months, it is \"perfectly awful\" for them<br />\nto set us such an example.<br />\nHOCKEY?<br />\n<br />\nWe are informed that our winsome friends<br />\nof the \"Ladies\" College have formed a hockey<br />\nclub.

He will lecture in McCoy<br />\nHall, alternating with Mr. Burton, on ''Phases<br />\nof Jewish Religious Life After the Exile.\"<br />\nTHE GLEE CLUB.<br />\n<br />\nThe Glee Club has been chosen, subject to<br />\nchange, by Mr. P. S. Evans of the Medical<br />\nSchool, a graduate of Yale, who led the Club so<br />\nsuccessfully last year. This year the personnel<br />\nis: First tenor\u2014W. W. Francis, F. J.

He received his A. B. degree<br />\nfrom Trinity College, Connecticut, in 1883,<br />\nand was made a doctor of philosophy by Hopkins in 1888. In 1887 he won a literary prize of<br />\n$100. From here he went to his home (Hartford, Conn.)and became an editor of The Hartford Courant, one of the prominent newspapers<br />\nof the country.<br />\nMr. Burton has the somewhat unusual distinction of being known as a poet and a newspaper man. He read an original poem at the<br />\nfirst commencement held in McCoy Hall, in<br />\nJune, 1894. In a list of representative alumni<br />\nthe '97 Hullabaloo contains a picture of Mr.<br />\nBurton with the subjects of his theses. He will<br />\ndeliver six lectures in McCoy Hall on \"The<br />\nModern Novel.\"<br />\nRev. Thomas Kelly Cheyne, D.

McCallum of the second-year class<br />\nmet with a painful accident on Sunday, December 5, which, however, luckily did not result seriously. While walking down the street<br />\ntwo dogs that were tied together ran up to him,<br />\none on each side. They tripped him up, and<br />\nhis head struck on the sidewalk, lacerating his<br />\nscalp and knocking him senseless for some little time. As a result he was laid up for a number of days.<br />\nDr. S. F. Baker was confined to his apartments last week with a cold and an attack of<br />\ntonsilitis. Dr. C. F. Barden had charge of his<br />\nclass during his absence.<br />\nProfessor Brooks' lectures proved very attractive to the medical students and the faculty<br />\nof the Medical School, many of them having<br />\nattended all the lectures, and a still larger number most of them.<br />\nWANTED\u2014In Dr. Mall's department someone who has finished a \"lower.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\nATHLETICS.<br />\nHOCKEY.<br />\n<br />\nThe affairs of the Hockey League have been<br />\nsettled and the opposition to the Maryland<br />\nHockey Club has won its point debarring that<br />\nteam from the League and getting ten per cent.<br />\nof the gate receipts at all games. The 'Varsity team played its first game on last Tuesday<br />\nnight week, and lost to Northampton by 4<br />\ngoals to 2. Scholl did not play at goal, and his<br />\nwork in the field was not comparable with his<br />\nunexcelled goal tending. The 'Varsity was<br />\noutplayed in team work, the Northampton<br />\nmen putting up a rattling, strong game.<br />\nIndoor baseball will begin as soon as the<br />\ncage is completed. The different classes have<br />\nbeen requested to organize teams to compete<br />\nfor a prize, which will be presented to the<br />\nwinning team. The prize is to be a handsome<br />\nbanner, on which will appear the names of the<br />\nvictorious players. The schedule of games will<br />\nbe arranged later on.<br />\nOn Monday some of the gymnasium apparatus was put in place. Several additions have<br />\nbeen made, among which are a double rowing<br />\nmachine and striking- bag drum. A very fine<br />\nwrestling carpet has also been procured. This<br />\ncarpet has long been needed. It is probable<br />\nthat Professor Doyle will give lessons in<br />\nwrestling two afternoons a week.<br />\nThe floor of the cage will be leveled and<br />\nrolled during the Christmas recess, and the<br />\nfoundation for the running track will be laid.<br />\nThe track will have to be banked somewhat<br />\nat the corners of the cage.<br />\nNEWS LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nSubscriptions for the remainder of the scholastic year will be ONE DOLLAR.

This was done to encourage real, honest efforts to make good literature, for there is<br />\nno reason why Hopkins men cannot write<br />\nverses and stories, if they only take enough<br />\ninterest in their own literary development and<br />\nIn giving to others about them their very best<br />\nthoughts. Everyone\u2014a student especially\u2014<br />\nneeds to train himself in the art of translating<br />\nthoughts into words. One may argue that<br />\nhe can think of nothing to write. But all of us<br />\nhave at divers and sundry times amorphous<br />\nimaginings and incoherent thoughts which<br />\nwould take a definite shape, so that we ourselves, and perhaps others, too, might profit by<br />\nthem,if we did but undertake earnestly the task<br />\nof putting them in words. We come to Hopkins to be trained to think ; we should take<br />\ncare while here not to neglect to train ourselves to express our thoughts. College training is too apt, we fear, to produce \"critics,\"<br />\nbut what we need is men of action. Youth is<br />\nthe time of action. We hope, then, that the<br />\npublication of the successful poems will not be<br />\nthe end of literary efforts among the student<br />\nbody, but that others may still continue their<br />\nefforts, though, perhaps, they did not gain the<br />\nprize in the present case.<br />\nSince two of the poems have been deemed<br />\nworthy of prizes by the committee, the $10 offered will be divided equally between the two<br />\nsuccessful competitors, whose names are<br />\nRoger Griswold Perkins (norn de plume, Oliver<br />\nWolcott); poem, \"Voices of the Woods;\" and<br />\nCarol Wight (nom de plume, Petrarch), poem,<br />\n\"Farewell.\"<br />\nMr. Perkins is a senior at the Medical School<br />\nand was graduated with the degree of A.

SHERWOOD ON \"BERLIN.\"<br /><br />\nProfessor Sherwood delivered an address<br />\nbefore the Historical and Political Science Association on Friday evening. \"Berlin\" was<br />\nthe subject he discussed, and his talk was based<br />\nUpon reminiscences of a short stop in that city<br />\nlast summer. Professor Sherwood expressed<br />\nhis disappointment with the famous boulevard,<br />\nUnter den Linden. It is true, the street is<br />\nabout two hundred feet wide, and has its sides<br />\nadorned with rows of horse-chestnut trees and<br />\nlindens, though the latter are of rather a languishing nature.<br />\nIn spite of several old ruins and crumbling<br />\ncastles of historic interest, Berlin impresses<br />\none as being a modern city. The houses are<br />\nbuilt of brick and stone, and are almost entirely of a modern origin. The municipal government of Berlin is the pride of its inhabitants, and with much justice,for it is one of the<br />\nbest governed cities in the world. In fact, the<br />\nofficials seem to carry their measures for cleanliness, etc., almost to an extreme. During the<br />\nsix weeks in which Professor Sherwood stayed<br />\nin the city it rained nearly every day; still the<br />\ngalas between were busily occupied by the<br />\nwater sprinklers.<br />\nOne of the most serious problems which<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nconfront the young men of the city is how to<br />\nmake their moustaches grow in a way they<br />\n\"hadn't orter.\" Hours are spent by the young<br />\ngallants of the city in barber shops, where tedious efforts are made to force the ends of the<br />\nmoustaches to take that much-desired upward<br />\nmovement. Although Berlin is one of the<br />\nlargest cities in Europe, yet it does not give<br />\none the impression of being a metropolis; especially is this fact brought out by the nature of<br />\nthe newspapers, which are distinctly provincial<br />\nin character. Berlin is a great business centre,<br />\nbut appearances are deceptive. Almost the<br />\nonly signs of vigorous activity in the business<br />\nworld are shown by the cabmen, who seem to<br />\nbe possessed of a mania to run down and ride<br />\nover everything in sight. Professor Sherwood<br />\nfound that it was not worth one's life to criticise the Emperor, though a considerable<br />\namount of caution was usually employed in exercising that right.<br />\nThe universities of Berlin have long been<br />\nfamous, and students from all lands may be<br />\nfound within their halls.<br />\nCAPITAL PUNISHI1ENT.<br /><br />\nStatistics and Bible quotations were the favorite weapons of the speakers on the question<br />\nwhether capital punishment should be abolished, which was discussed in the last session of<br />\nthe Senate. The affirmative side won the debate. Those who took part, for the affirmative,<br />\nwere Senators Dohme, Hubner and Hodges.<br />\nThose on the negative side were Senators Robinson, F. Smith and Brent. Senators Ballard<br />\nand Pender, who took part in the open debate,<br />\nshowed that both these methods of argument<br />\ncan be used to prove either yea or nay, and<br />\nthat with them but little can be accomplished.<br />\nA short, humane plea, put forth by Senator<br />\nR. D. Miller, turned the tables against the adherents of rapid methods. The whole house<br />\nshowed great interest in the progress and result of the debate.<br />\nThe Senate will meet again on January 12,<br />\n1898, when Senators Gordon, Francis and Peters will speak for the annexation of Hawaii.<br />\nSenators M.

Since the authorities have provided proper accommodations, they may reasonably require students to use them.<br />\nIt is to be hoped that they will make physical<br />\nculture, in its place, just as important as laboratory work. The man of whom it is required<br />\nshould be made to feel that the requirement<br />\nmeans something; that his attendance will be<br />\nmarked and his absence noted. We question<br />\nwhether the compulsion might not well be extended to all undergraduates instead of freshmen alone, as heretofore. We should grumble<br />\nsomewhat, no doubt, as we do now at some<br />\nother things, but at the end of the course we<br />\nshould be grateful. The College Congress bids<br />\nfair to be successful, where other plans failed,<br />\nbecause it has been made a part of the course<br />\nand attendance is required. The same may be<br />\nfound true of gymnasium classes. For the<br />\nbusy student regular exercise is a matter in<br />\nwhich the spirit is willing, but the flesh is often<br />\nvery weak.<br /><br />\nPHYSICAL TRAININO,<br /><br />\nThe new gymnasium and cage are almost<br />\ncompleted, and in a short time presumably<br />\nthey will be thrown open to the students. This<br />\nshould give a new impulse to all branches of<br />\nathletics. Candidates for the teams will devote themselves to practice. Many will moralize about the value of systematic exercise, and<br />\nwill begin to use the apparatus diligently. The<br />\nnovelty will speedily wear off, the work will<br />\nbecome irksome and they will give it up. Interest will fail, and we may find ourselves, with<br />\na new gymnasium and the largest cage in the<br />\ncountry in just the same position in regard to<br />\nathletics as before. We are confident, however,that this will not be so, for we believe that<br />\nthe businesslike management that marks the<br />\nUniversity in other departments will prevail<br />\nlikewise in the gymnasium. Last year physical culture, as a part of the course, existed<br />\nchiefly on the class books. Those of us who<br />\nremember our frequent dashes in scanty apparel between the barnlike gymnasium and inadequate bathroom on the ground floor, and<br />\nour lockers close under the roof of an adjoin-<br /><br />\nHAZING AT W. C. B.<br /><br />\nWe learn from reliable sources that the<br />\nsophomores of the Woman's College have actually been reprimanded for hazing the freshmen. It must be explained, however, that it is<br />\nnot the rough-and-tumble, pot-social variety<br />\nwith which we are familiar. At one time, we<br />\nare told, they presented the freshmen with<br />\nsticks of candy tied with green ribbons. Again<br />\nthey mingled the bray of horns with the sweet<br />\nstrains of freshmen concerts, and cut the jaunty<br />\ntassels from freshmen caps. We are surprised<br />\nand pained. After the Dean has persuaded<br />\nus to give up matriculation hazing, and the<br />\nfreshmen and juniors have lived in peace for<br />\nthree months, it is \"perfectly awful\" for them<br />\nto set us such an example.<br />\nHOCKEY?<br /><br />\nWe are informed that our winsome friends<br />\nof the \"Ladies\" College have formed a hockey<br />\nclub.

We sincerely hope that they<br />\nwill have more success in the game than we<br />\nhave had. If they get to be very proficient in<br />\nthe art, perhaps we shall be delighted to play<br />\nthem a game. But, possibly, the appearance in<br />\nthe arena of this new club would introduce additional complications to the already disturbed<br />\nstate of hockey affairs. Upon more mature<br />\nreflection, however, we are inclined to believe<br />\nthat their game is not hockey, but merely<br />\nshinny.<br /><br />\nPRACTICAL ECONOMICS.<br /><br />\nA professor in economics at the Hopkins<br />\nhas aroused the admiration of the department<br />\nby his complete mastery of his subject. He<br />\nrode a wheel through Europe last summer,and<br />\nat the end of his trip sold it for more than he<br />\npaid for it. The professor is to be congratulated for his clever application of economic<br />\ntheory to fact.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nas an authority on matters pertaining to Biblical scholarship. He has published a large<br />\nnumber of critical works on Old Testament literature and has paid special attention to the<br />\nBook of Psalms. He will lecture in McCoy<br />\nHall, alternating with Mr. Burton, on ''Phases<br />\nof Jewish Religious Life After the Exile.\"<br />\nTHE GLEE CLUB.<br /><br />\nThe Glee Club has been chosen, subject to<br />\nchange, by Mr. P.

He received his A. B. degree<br />\nfrom Trinity College, Connecticut, in 1883,<br />\nand was made a doctor of philosophy by Hopkins in 1888. In 1887 he won a literary prize of<br />\n$100. From here he went to his home (Hartford, Conn.)and became an editor of The Hartford Courant, one of the prominent newspapers<br />\nof the country.<br />\nMr. Burton has the somewhat unusual distinction of being known as a poet and a newspaper man. He read an original poem at the<br />\nfirst commencement held in McCoy Hall, in<br />\nJune, 1894. In a list of representative alumni<br />\nthe '97 Hullabaloo contains a picture of Mr.<br />\nBurton with the subjects of his theses. He will<br />\ndeliver six lectures in McCoy Hall on \"The<br />\nModern Novel.\"<br />\nRev. Thomas Kelly Cheyne, D.

The 'Varsity team played its first game on last Tuesday<br />\nnight week, and lost to Northampton by 4<br />\ngoals to 2.
