As a result, we are happily free from<br />\nthe pressures and over-emphasis which have stigmatized<br />\ncollege athletics out of the hands of students.<br />\nWe engage in extensive intercollegiate competition.<br />\nWe like to win. We believe athletics to be an essential and<br />\ndelightful part of the student life. Our policy is to provide<br />\nopportunities to play hard, to play to win, to have fun, but to<br />\nachieve these ends in a true spirit and in a manner that makes<br />\nathletics a wholesome supplement to education and an appropriate part of well-rounded student life.<br />\nDI. JAMES R. KILLIAN, JR.<br />\nPresident, Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology.<br />\nThose are words which very concisely summarize nearly the<br />\ntotal athletic picture at an institution where athletic activities<br />\nare run on a level very near that of The Hopkins. In those<br />\nshort paragraphs Dr. Killian brings out one of the best stated<br />\npurposes for any college to have. That is the pnrpose of making<br />\n\"athletics a wholesome supplement to education and an appropriate part of well-rounded student life.\" Ivan J. Geiger, Director<br />\nof Athletics at the Institute, sets the aim of providing \"meaningful<br />\nathletic activities\" as his goal in setting,up the athletic program<br />\nthere. \"The primary objectives,\" according to Mr. Geiger, \"are<br />\nthe promotion of physical and mental fitness, social efficiency,<br />\nand culture through sane participation.\"<br />\n\"Compete On An Honorable Basis\"<br />\n<br />\nSwarthmore College's athletic head, Willis J. Stetson, says<br />\nthe following in discussing that College's program:\"Swarthmore<br />\nCollege, like any normal institution, wishes to see its teams win<br />\ntheir share of contests. But it does not place such undue emphasis<br />\non winning that 'to win at any cost' becomes the guiding slogan:<br />\nOur emphasis is on participation and we feel that with diversified<br />\nschedules, proficient instruction, and proper spirit, we can compete<br />\non an honorable basis with our opponents.\"<br />\nThat's the story on two places of higher learning similar to<br />\nours who also have comparable athletic policies. Last week<br />\nThe 'Nester stated the aims of our program as set-forth by the<br />\nadministrators of such. These aims were (1) to put athletics in<br />\nthe proper place of the university program and, (2) to place<br />\nproper emphasis on such in an educational institution such as<br />\nours. They are generalized statements, but the Hopkins principals are sure to go along with the goals of M.I.T. and Swarthmore.<br />\nSince all the colleges and universities (Hopkins, Swarthmore,<br />\nV. of Chicago, Haverfoid, M.I.T., Amherst, Oberlin and Harvard)<br />\nrepresented in the series of articles published in The North Central<br />\nAssociation Quarterly last spring agree in purpose you'd no<br />\ndoubt think they must have similar over-all programs.

As a result, we are happily free from<br />\nthe pressures and over-emphasis which have stigmatized<br />\ncollege athletics out of the hands of students.<br />\nWe engage in extensive intercollegiate competition.<br />\nWe like to win. We believe athletics to be an essential and<br />\ndelightful part of the student life. Our policy is to provide<br />\nopportunities to play hard, to play to win, to have fun, but to<br />\nachieve these ends in a true spirit and in a manner that makes<br />\nathletics a wholesome supplement to education and an appropriate part of well-rounded student life.<br />\nDI. JAMES R. KILLIAN, JR.<br />\nPresident, Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology.<br />\nThose are words which very concisely summarize nearly the<br />\ntotal athletic picture at an institution where athletic activities<br />\nare run on a level very near that of The Hopkins. In those<br />\nshort paragraphs Dr. Killian brings out one of the best stated<br />\npurposes for any college to have. That is the pnrpose of making<br />\n\"athletics a wholesome supplement to education and an appropriate part of well-rounded student life.\" Ivan J. Geiger, Director<br />\nof Athletics at the Institute, sets the aim of providing \"meaningful<br />\nathletic activities\" as his goal in setting,up the athletic program<br />\nthere. \"The primary objectives,\" according to Mr. Geiger, \"are<br />\nthe promotion of physical and mental fitness, social efficiency,<br />\nand culture through sane participation.\"<br />\n\"Compete On An Honorable Basis\"<br /><br />\nSwarthmore College's athletic head, Willis J. Stetson, says<br />\nthe following in discussing that College's program:\"Swarthmore<br />\nCollege, like any normal institution, wishes to see its teams win<br />\ntheir share of contests. But it does not place such undue emphasis<br />\non winning that 'to win at any cost' becomes the guiding slogan:<br />\nOur emphasis is on participation and we feel that with diversified<br />\nschedules, proficient instruction, and proper spirit, we can compete<br />\non an honorable basis with our opponents.\"<br />\nThat's the story on two places of higher learning similar to<br />\nours who also have comparable athletic policies. Last week<br />\nThe 'Nester stated the aims of our program as set-forth by the<br />\nadministrators of such. These aims were (1) to put athletics in<br />\nthe proper place of the university program and, (2) to place<br />\nproper emphasis on such in an educational institution such as<br />\nours. They are generalized statements, but the Hopkins principals are sure to go along with the goals of M.I.T. and Swarthmore.<br />\nSince all the colleges and universities (Hopkins, Swarthmore,<br />\nV. of Chicago, Haverfoid, M.I.T., Amherst, Oberlin and Harvard)<br />\nrepresented in the series of articles published in The North Central<br />\nAssociation Quarterly last spring agree in purpose you'd no<br />\ndoubt think they must have similar over-all programs.
