The<br />\nticket is:<br />\n<br />\nThe Musical Clubs gave their annual concert and dance in McCoy<br />\nHall last Tuesday evening. The<br />\nweather did not hinder a large and<br />\nenthusiastic audience from attending and showing their approval by<br />\ncalling for repeated encores. Nearly all the seats were taken, and<br />\nthe clubs feel that they have been<br />\nrewarded to some extent for their<br />\nlabors by the good results from last<br />\nTuesday's concert.<br />\nThe concert itself was probably<br />\nthe best the clubs have given in<br />\nlate years. Favorable comment has<br />\nbeen heard on all sides, and very<br />\nlittle complaint. The Instrumental<br />\nClub made an especially good showing, and the instrumental solos held<br />\nthe attention of everyone. The<br />\nquartette and \"Mrs. Winslow\" won<br />\nthe laurels for the vocal side of<br />\nthe concert. The leaders and members of the clubs .are to be congratulated on their good work.<br />\nThose who took part in the concert<br />\nwere: Messrs. Gillet, Fulton, Getz,<br />\nLloyd, Ray, Bacchus, Paulus,<br />\nSchmied, Bowden, White, Eiseman,<br />\nSpencer, Aler, Scovell, Donoho,<br />\nMarston, Howell, Supplee, Spieker,<br />\nRandall, Wagner, Breuninger, JacObs, Niles, Weber, Melamet, Niles,<br />\nSchneeberger, Uhler, Coblentz,<br />\nLynch, Uhler, Knipp, Tappan, Geissel, Steinmuller, Gminder, Lauchheimer, Cole, Baker, Marshall and<br />\nLinthicum.<br />\nThe ushers were Messrs. Huck,<br />\nDorsey, Rice, Branham, Richardson and Brinton.<br />\nThe concert was followed by the<br />\nusual dance. Last Tuesday's affair<br />\nproved to be an especially enjoyable<br />\none. A good orchestra's services<br />\nhad been secured, and it furnished<br />\nexcellent music for the new tango<br />\ndance. Everyone seemed to enjoy<br />\nthe dancing thoroughly, and regrets were heard on all sides when<br />\nmidnight put an end to the pleasure.<br />\nEnthusiasts were heard to say that,<br />\nfor a long time McCoy Hall had<br />\nnever been the scene of a dance<br />\nwhere the attendance was as large,<br />\nthe dancers as enthusiastic, the women as beautifully gowned and the<br />\nmusic as good as last Tuesday.<br />\n\u2022 On Saturday, February 22, the<br />\nclubs will give a concert and dance<br />\nin Salisbury. On the twenty-fifth<br />\nthey will perform at one of the Baltimore churches, and will go to<br />\nCatonsville on the twenty-seventh.<br />\nTwo or three other concerts are being planned to follow these, but no<br />\ndates have as yet been definitely<br />\narranged.<br />\n<br />\nWith the assurance of a representative portion of the student<br />\nbody at a mass-meeting last week<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins would have a<br />\nlarge number of marchers in the inaugural parade in Washington on<br />\nMarch 4, Chairman Freddie Lee<br />\nappointed the following committee<br />\nto arrange details for the University's delegation: Walter D. Sutton<br />\n(chairman), John Sharp Dickinson, C. Leland Getz, President J.<br />\nMiller Leake of the Hopkins Wilson Club, John C. Branham, Steuart D. White, Blanchard Randall,<br />\nArthur Primrose and Lewis Breuninger. Freddie Lee will also serve.<br />\nThe committee, while composed<br />\nof undergraduates with but two exceptions, will make an effort to enlist alumni, medical, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students.<br />\nIn view of the fact that a suspension of exercises has been<br />\ngranted by the faculty and the<br />\nproximity of Washington, the University should turn out the second<br />\nlargest delegation in the college<br />\nmen's division of the parade.<br />\nPrinceton, of course, will lead in<br />\nnumbers. Already over 1,200 have<br />\ndecided to march for their former<br />\npresident, and they will be first<br />\nin line.<br />\nJohns Hopkins; University of<br />\nVirginia and Davidson College will<br />\nfollow Princeton according to the<br />\nsize of the delegation.<br />\nA letter received from the committee of arrangements for the<br />\nparade said in part:<br />\n\"Therefore, it is apparent that<br />\nthe position of your delegation will<br />\ndepend on the result of your efforts<br />\nto enlist men.\"<br />\nThe question of what is to be<br />\nworn by the marchers has not yet<br />\nbeen decided upon, but it is hoped<br />\nthat caps and gowns will be selected. Across the gowns a band bearing \"Johns Hopkins\" will be worn.<br />\nAll marchers must be dressed in<br />\na uniform style. If it is decided not<br />\nto wear caps and gowns, some other<br />\nstyle of dress will be selected.<br />\nHopkins wants second place in<br />\nthe line, and it will not be to the<br />\ncredit of the students to fall 'behind any other institution than<br />\nPrinceton. The demonstration is<br />\nnon-partisan, without political significance, and will be purely patriotic in chatacter. The faculty has<br />\nallowed a holiday, and it is with the<br />\ncondition that the student body<br />\nshould go to a man. It may seldom<br />\noccur that the University will have a<br />\n<br />\nJohns Hopkins, in the most thrilling of the relay races at the Fifth<br />\nRegiment - Johns Hopkins games<br />\nlast Saturday night at the Armory,<br />\nlowered the only South Atlantic<br />\nAssociation record broken during<br />\nthe meet.<br />\nThe event, too, makes the Black<br />\n4nd Blue team the champion South<br />\nAtlantic mile relayers. The time<br />\nwas 3 minutes 3375 seconds as<br />\nagainst 3 minutes and 37 seconds<br />\nregistered by the McCulloh Athletic<br />\nClub some time ago.<br />\nCaptain Catlin, Lloyd, Wells and<br />\nMcDonagh of the Hopkins team<br />\nhad saved up their strength at the<br />\nsacrifice of other events and throwing all energy into the race they<br />\nwere. determined to nose the victory<br />\nfrom Washington and Lee and the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia.<br />\nPerhaps the prettiest run of the<br />\nfour was made by Lloyd, the third<br />\nman, who made up a dangerous<br />\nlead, giving Catlin one yard to his<br />\nadvantage at the start of the last<br />\nlap. Catlin was pushed for the position, but broke the tape only a few<br />\ninches ahead of Cooke, Virginia's<br />\nstar relay man.<br />\nThe race was the most interesting and thrilling of the meet, and<br />\na suprisingly large gallery of Hopkins rooters made a convention-like<br />\ndin of cheers and hullabaloos when<br />\nCatlin was carried from the finish<br />\nby Hopkins men.<br />\nAnother relay won by Hopkins\u2014<br />\nthat for the State mile championship<br />\n\u2014called forth cheering. St. John's<br />\nCollege withdrew from the event,<br />\nleaving Western Maryland to contest Hopkins. Wagner, Ray, Stiehel and Groover composed the team.<br />\nBob Eller of Georgetown was the<br />\nshining star of the games. He<br />\ncarried off four firsts, three of<br />\nwhich were South Atlantic championships. The other championship<br />\nwas won by Gallagher, also of<br />\nGeorgrtown. The events were the<br />\nS. A. A. A. U. 100-yard dash,<br />\nioo-yard hurdles, 220-yard dash<br />\nand the open 100-yard hurdles, all<br />\nwon by Eller; and the 88o-yard run<br />\nwon by Gallagher.<br />\nIn the 100-yard dash for the<br />\nSouth Atlantic championship Wagner of Hopkins was second to Eller,<br />\nbut the men were so close that to<br />\nthose who stood near the finish it<br />\nlooked as if the Hopkins man had<br />\nwon. White and Voshell placed in the heats.<br />\nIn the field events other Hopkins<br />\nmen took places.

A good orchestra's services<br />\nhad been secured, and it furnished<br />\nexcellent music for the new tango<br />\ndance. Everyone seemed to enjoy<br />\nthe dancing thoroughly, and regrets were heard on all sides when<br />\nmidnight put an end to the pleasure.<br />\nEnthusiasts were heard to say that,<br />\nfor a long time McCoy Hall had<br />\nnever been the scene of a dance<br />\nwhere the attendance was as large,<br />\nthe dancers as enthusiastic, the women as beautifully gowned and the<br />\nmusic as good as last Tuesday.<br />\n\u2022 On Saturday, February 22, the<br />\nclubs will give a concert and dance<br />\nin Salisbury. On the twenty-fifth<br />\nthey will perform at one of the Baltimore churches, and will go to<br />\nCatonsville on the twenty-seventh.<br />\nTwo or three other concerts are being planned to follow these, but no<br />\ndates have as yet been definitely<br />\narranged.<br /><br />\nWith the assurance of a representative portion of the student<br />\nbody at a mass-meeting last week<br />\nthat Johns Hopkins would have a<br />\nlarge number of marchers in the inaugural parade in Washington on<br />\nMarch 4, Chairman Freddie Lee<br />\nappointed the following committee<br />\nto arrange details for the University's delegation: Walter D. Sutton<br />\n(chairman), John Sharp Dickinson, C. Leland Getz, President J.<br />\nMiller Leake of the Hopkins Wilson Club, John C. Branham, Steuart D. White, Blanchard Randall,<br />\nArthur Primrose and Lewis Breuninger. Freddie Lee will also serve.<br />\nThe committee, while composed<br />\nof undergraduates with but two exceptions, will make an effort to enlist alumni, medical, graduate and<br />\nundergraduate students.<br />\nIn view of the fact that a suspension of exercises has been<br />\ngranted by the faculty and the<br />\nproximity of Washington, the University should turn out the second<br />\nlargest delegation in the college<br />\nmen's division of the parade.<br />\nPrinceton, of course, will lead in<br />\nnumbers. Already over 1,200 have<br />\ndecided to march for their former<br />\npresident, and they will be first<br />\nin line.<br />\nJohns Hopkins; University of<br />\nVirginia and Davidson College will<br />\nfollow Princeton according to the<br />\nsize of the delegation.<br />\nA letter received from the committee of arrangements for the<br />\nparade said in part:<br />\n\"Therefore, it is apparent that<br />\nthe position of your delegation will<br />\ndepend on the result of your efforts<br />\nto enlist men.\"<br />\nThe question of what is to be<br />\nworn by the marchers has not yet<br />\nbeen decided upon, but it is hoped<br />\nthat caps and gowns will be selected. Across the gowns a band bearing \"Johns Hopkins\" will be worn.<br />\nAll marchers must be dressed in<br />\na uniform style. If it is decided not<br />\nto wear caps and gowns, some other<br />\nstyle of dress will be selected.<br />\nHopkins wants second place in<br />\nthe line, and it will not be to the<br />\ncredit of the students to fall 'behind any other institution than<br />\nPrinceton. The demonstration is<br />\nnon-partisan, without political significance, and will be purely patriotic in chatacter. The faculty has<br />\nallowed a holiday, and it is with the<br />\ncondition that the student body<br />\nshould go to a man. It may seldom<br />\noccur that the University will have a<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins, in the most thrilling of the relay races at the Fifth<br />\nRegiment - Johns Hopkins games<br />\nlast Saturday night at the Armory,<br />\nlowered the only South Atlantic<br />\nAssociation record broken during<br />\nthe meet.<br />\nThe event, too, makes the Black<br />\n4nd Blue team the champion South<br />\nAtlantic mile relayers. The time<br />\nwas 3 minutes 3375 seconds as<br />\nagainst 3 minutes and 37 seconds<br />\nregistered by the McCulloh Athletic<br />\nClub some time ago.<br />\nCaptain Catlin, Lloyd, Wells and<br />\nMcDonagh of the Hopkins team<br />\nhad saved up their strength at the<br />\nsacrifice of other events and throwing all energy into the race they<br />\nwere. determined to nose the victory<br />\nfrom Washington and Lee and the<br />\nUniversity of Virginia.<br />\nPerhaps the prettiest run of the<br />\nfour was made by Lloyd, the third<br />\nman, who made up a dangerous<br />\nlead, giving Catlin one yard to his<br />\nadvantage at the start of the last<br />\nlap. Catlin was pushed for the position, but broke the tape only a few<br />\ninches ahead of Cooke, Virginia's<br />\nstar relay man.<br />\nThe race was the most interesting and thrilling of the meet, and<br />\na suprisingly large gallery of Hopkins rooters made a convention-like<br />\ndin of cheers and hullabaloos when<br />\nCatlin was carried from the finish<br />\nby Hopkins men.<br />\nAnother relay won by Hopkins\u2014<br />\nthat for the State mile championship<br />\n\u2014called forth cheering. St. John's<br />\nCollege withdrew from the event,<br />\nleaving Western Maryland to contest Hopkins. Wagner, Ray, Stiehel and Groover composed the team.<br />\nBob Eller of Georgetown was the<br />\nshining star of the games. He<br />\ncarried off four firsts, three of<br />\nwhich were South Atlantic championships. The other championship<br />\nwas won by Gallagher, also of<br />\nGeorgrtown. The events were the<br />\nS. A. A. A. U. 100-yard dash,<br />\nioo-yard hurdles, 220-yard dash<br />\nand the open 100-yard hurdles, all<br />\nwon by Eller; and the 88o-yard run<br />\nwon by Gallagher.<br />\nIn the 100-yard dash for the<br />\nSouth Atlantic championship Wagner of Hopkins was second to Eller,<br />\nbut the men were so close that to<br />\nthose who stood near the finish it<br />\nlooked as if the Hopkins man had<br />\nwon. White and Voshell placed in the heats.<br />\nIn the field events other Hopkins<br />\nmen took places.

But<br />\n_perhaps it was only the shadow of<br />\nsome dancer that fell upon us for<br />\na moment that made me fear that<br />\nthe eyes of my companion were indeed like summer skies (to which<br />\nI had secretly compared them),<br />\nwhich so easily become overcast<br />\nwith clouds, the prophets of a *coming storm.<br />\n\"No, as I have never had the<br />\npleasure of meeting any real suffragettes, I have never signed the petition. Are they really so very ugly ?\"<br />\nI said in vain hope of changing the<br />\ntopic of the conversation.<br />\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I have a book<br />\nhere which you can sign without<br />\nhaving to meet the awful suffragettes,\" and she pulled out from<br />\nnowhere a beautiful, gilt edge memorandum book. \"And,\" she said<br />\ncoaxingly, and somewhat triumphantly, too, \"all my friends have<br />\nsigned it.\"<br />\n\"But,\" I ejaculated, \"I want to<br />\ncome to some of your meetings before I sign.\"<br />\n\"We'll have no more meetings before my report must be sent into<br />\nthe League,\" she quietly replied.<br />\nBut the very feeling of the book<br />\nseemed to bring me to my senses.<br />\nStraightening my shoulders, but not<br />\nlifting my eyes, I began to speak as I<br />\nthought big brothers should talk to<br />\ntheir silly little sisters. \"Why,\",,I<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nbegan, \"don't you know that if<br />\nwomen got votes most of the divorce and property laws now so<br />\nfavorable to women would be repealed at once?
