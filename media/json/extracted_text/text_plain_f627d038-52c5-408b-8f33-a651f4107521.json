Hence, the new (shorter) list.<br />\nNone of this is something new. Two<br />\nyears ago, the council tabled the list and<br />\nrequested written biographies of every<br />\nrecipient. A week later\u2014biographies in<br />\nhand\u2014the council voted down the list<br />\nagain.

What is in<br />\ndoubt is the extent to which those<br />\nchanges will benefit students.<br />\nObviously, students will benefit as<br />\nmuch as everyone else from the academic<br />\nimprovements brought about by renovation. But an equally important question<br />\nis how much the social lives of students<br />\nwill improve. Most of the construction<br />\nalready planned (or already underway)<br />\nis for places such as Mergenthaler/Jenkins, Ames and a new Physics<br />\nand Astronomy building\u2014places that<br />\ndon't effect the non-academic lives of<br />\nstudents very much.<br />\nEven the changes slated for Gilman<br />\nHall\u2014the one significantly nonacademic building where renovations are<br />\nalready in the works\u2014are mainly general<br />\nimprovements like lighting and heating<br />\nand moving the academic deans into the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nBut in defending the recent tuition increase to the Student Council Wednesday, University President Steven Muller<br />\nbrought up an idea we think would<br />\nbenefit the average Hopkins student:<br />\nbuilding a connection between Gilman<br />\nand Levering halls,<br />\nThe proposal is far from novel. Such<br />\na plan has been bouncing around for<br />\nyears, although it has always been in that<br />\neternal \"very, very tentative\" stage administrators love so dearly. The idea is<br />\ngenerally to use the area as a true student union, with things such as corn-<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nor at least apprehensive about<br />\napplying for a position if they<br />\nhave not ben involved with the<br />\ncouncil before. As a freshman,<br />\nI applied for and got the posilion of Education Chairman<br />\nfor my sophomore year. At that<br />\ntime, I had no experience in the<br />\narea but demonstrated a willingness to work hard and an interest and enthusiasm for the<br />\ncommittee. It is for this reason<br />\nthat I believe I got the job, for<br />\nI knew surely few members of<br />\n<br />\nmunal areas, restaurants or cafes, shops,<br />\nbowling alleys, etc.<br />\nBut while the idea has been around<br />\nforever, the planned renovations for<br />\nGilman make the idea particularly important just now.<br />\nWhen Dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Fisher and Dean of the<br />\nG.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering<br />\nV. David VandeLinde move into<br />\nGilman, the Gilman Coffee Shop(hitherto a valuable meeting place for students)<br />\nwill die. Whether that's justified or not<br />\nis irrelevant\u2014if we were Fisher or<br />\nVandeLinde we wouldn't want the<br />\nGilman Coffee Shop just outside of our<br />\noffices either.<br />\nIt's hardly news to note that this campus isn't exactly overflowing with places<br />\nfor students to congregate even now.<br />\nThat situation will worsen when the Coffee Shop closes. But building some sort<br />\nof true student union between Gilman<br />\nand Levering would change all that. Doing so, of course, will require a sacrifice<br />\nfrom the administration. A student<br />\nunion won't win academic awards; it<br />\nwon't attract world-famous scholars; it<br />\nwon't enable the University to conduct<br />\nmore research.<br />\nBut making life more livable for<br />\nstudents (and, for that matter, for administrators, staff members and faculty<br />\nmembers) is a worthwhile goal. And<br />\nwhen Gilman is renovated, one of the<br />\nbetter ways to do that will be to build a<br />\nstudent union.<br />\n<br />\nanother SAC group or for that<br />\nmatter could justify their work<br />\nin some task outside the<br />\nUniversity, I would feel that<br />\nthey were equally qualified. The<br />\nfact that many people in the<br />\npositions come from the council comes from the fact that<br />\nthey hear and know of the positions which are open at the time<br />\nand that their abilities are also<br />\nknown by the interviewers. It is<br />\nfor this reason that I wrote this<br />\narticle.<br />\nI understand that many people might not know of the positions which are open and that<br />\nmany might not feel qualified<br />\n<br />\nthe student government at<br />\nHopkins. It is this same spirit<br />\nwhich I wish to use in selecting<br />\nthe committee chairmen for the<br />\n'87-'87 school year.<br />\nAs for the positions which<br />\nare open, at the moment there<br />\nare five major committees on<br />\nthe council which need<br />\nchairmen for next year. The<br />\nStudent Services Committee is<br />\nby its name that committee<br />\nwhich works to find and create<br />\nservices for students. This committee used to be known under<br />\nthe title of student life as it is<br />\nconcerned with all aspects of<br />\nstudent life and how it can be<br />\nimproved. Some past examples<br />\nof this committee's work include the Rotunda, BWI airport, and White Marsh shuttles<br />\nas well as trips and after exam<br />\namenities. For more information you should contact Dave<br />\nShade or Stephanie Weissman,<br />\nthe co-chairmen.<br />\nThe Career Advising and<br />\nPlacement Committee deals<br />\nprimarily with seminars on<br />\nvarious types of opportunities<br />\nwhich<br />\noccur<br />\nafter<br />\ngraduation\u2014i.e., careers in<br />\npublic health, international<br />\ntrade, and graduate schools.<br />\nThe committee next year will<br />\nalso work on an internship program for Hopkins students.

Interesting music was playing,<br />\nand the ambience had a pleasant feel. The costumes the<br />\nwaiters and waitresses wore<br />\nheightened the atmosphere.<br />\nWe were seated immediately<br />\nand menus were brought promptly. We ordered the Honey Wine<br />\n(2.75), a sweet honey-flavored<br />\nwhite wine, which we sipped<br />\nwhile we chose from a wide<br />\nrange of dishes. These included beef, lamb, chicken,<br />\nseafood, and vegetarian entrees. The menu described<br />\nEthiopian food to have two<br />\nmain ingredients: the first, Injera, is an unleavened sour<br />\ndough bread made of various<br />\ngrains and has a crepe-like consistency. The second is a spiced<br />\nstew which acts as a base for the<br />\nmeat or vegetable. Key Wat<br />\ncontains a spicy red hot pepper<br />\ncalled berbere and spicy butter<br />\nknown as Niter-Kibbeh. Alicha<br />\ncontains Niter-Kibbeh, plus<br />\ntumeric, green peppers and<br />\nspices.<br />\n<br />\nTwo of us shared Queen<br />\nSheba's dinner for two<br />\n($25.00), which included a<br />\nsampling of five of the main<br />\ndishes and homemade cottage<br />\ncheese and two vegetables,<br />\nwhich are served with all meals.<br />\nThe dinner also included two<br />\nglasses of Queen Sheba's wine,<br />\nwhich was similar to the Honey<br />\nWine. The dinner for four<br />\n($43.50) included even more.<br />\nMy other friends chose Yatakilt<br />\nKilikl ($5.50), fresh broccoli<br />\nand cauliflower simmered with<br />\ntomato, onion, and green pep- per, and Minchet Abish<br />\n($5.25), chopped top round<br />\ncooked with a combination of<br />\nseasonings and onions. Our<br />\nsampling of Doro Wat, Lega<br />\nTibs, Quanta Fitfit, and Yebeg<br />\nWat was overwhelming. The<br />\nspiciest were the Doro Wat,<br />\nchicken in berbere sauce, and<br />\nKitfo, Ethiopian steak tartare.<br />\nThe Lega Tibs, Ethiopian style<br />\nShish-Kebob, and Quanta Fitfit, seasoned beef cubes mixed<br />\nwith Injera, were my favorites.<br />\nThe Yebeg Wat was a mild<br />\nlamb and berbere dish which<br />\nwas also very pleasing. Our two<br />\n\"vegetables were lentil bean dip<br />\nand delicately seasoned<br />\ntomatoes.<br />\nThe food was brought in serving bowls on two giant silver<br />\nplatters lined with lnjera. More<br />\nInjera was served on another<br />\nplate, and it became apparent<br />\nthat we were to use the bread in<br />\n<br />\nplace of utensils. This proved to<br />\nbe most challenging and very<br />\nfun. Its mild flavor helped to<br />\nbalance the highly seasoned entrees. The homemade cottage<br />\ncheese was the best I had ever<br />\ntasted. It was impossible for us<br />\nto finish the enormous amount<br />\nof food which crowded the<br />\ntable. For those interested in<br />\nordering specific entrees instead<br />\nof the elaborate dinners listed<br />\nabove, prices ranged from $5 to<br />\n$7. Salads ran from $1.75 to<br />\n$2.50. Only two appetizers were<br />\nlisted, vegetable or meat Sambussa ($1.95, $2.25) which were<br />\npastry shells filled with a spicy<br />\nhot filling, and Azifa ($2.95), a<br />\ncold lentil bean and herb dip.<br />\nDessert was a choice of three<br />\ndifferent cakes, Carrot, German Chocolate, and :Devil's<br />\nFood. At $2.50 per slice, the<br />\nsmall portion of dry German<br />\nChocolate cake was a disappointment. The standard selection of beverages were available<br />\nas well as Ethiopian wines and<br />\ncoffee.<br />\nMy friends and I found<br />\nQueen of Sheba to be an inexpensive and pleasantly different<br />\ndining experience. Other than<br />\nhaving to wait a while for our<br />\nfood, the service was excellent,<br />\nand the food well worth waiting<br />\nfor. It is within walking<br />\ndistance from campus and was<br />\na nice change from the standard<br />\nfare in the area.<br />\n<br />\nA Chance to<br />\nStrike Out a Dean<br />\nSo you want to strike out<br />\na dean? Or throw out Paul<br />\nKadri at the plate?<br />\nWell, you may get your<br />\nchance next weekend, when<br />\nthe Student Council, the<br />\nHOP and the Graduate<br />\nRepresentative Organization<br />\nco-sponsor the Hopkins<br />\nGrand Slam, a softball tournament to benefit the National Kidney Foundation of<br />\nMaryland.<br />\n\"It's kind of a combined<br />\neffort,\" said co-chairman<br />\nTim Fallon. He said he hopes<br />\nthe tournament will raise<br />\nabout $1000-$1500 for the<br />\ncharity.<br />\nThe money will be raised<br />\nthrough a $5-per-person fee.<br />\nFor the fee, participants will<br />\nbe ible to play two games<br />\nand-get a free T-shirt. Teams<br />\nwill have to bring their own<br />\nballs, but other equipment<br />\nwill be provided, Fallon said.<br />\nIndividuals can also sign up,<br />\n<br />\nhe said.<br />\nRegistration for the<br />\ntournament\u2014which will be<br />\nplayed May 2-4--has already<br />\nbegun, and will continue in<br />\nfront of Levering Hall on<br />\nweekdays from 11 a.m. to 2<br />\np.m. until Thursday. The $5<br />\nfee must be paid when<br />\nregistering, Fallon said.<br />\nTeams\u2014which will consist<br />\nof 10 members each\u2014can be<br />\nformed by anyone. So far,<br />\nFallon said, about 10 or 15<br />\nteams have committed to<br />\nplaying, but he hopes to end<br />\nup with 30 to 40.<br />\nAnd if you've carried a<br />\ngrudge all year\u2014this may be<br />\nyour chance. The Student<br />\nCouncil, the Student Activities Commission and Phi<br />\nPsi fraternity are among<br />\ngroups that are already committed to playing.<br />\nIf that isn't good enough<br />\nfor you, Fallon said he hopes<br />\nthe deans will form a team.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/13<br />\n<br />\nCrossword<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n<br />\n10<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\n11<br />\n<br />\n12<br />\n<br />\nby Ron DeMatteo<br />\n42 Novel set in French Rev.,<br />\nwith \"A\"<br />\n45 Correct<br />\n46 Gaelic<br />\n47 Italian ruling family<br />\n48 Chartered<br />\n50 Squeal<br />\n52 Roman Cath.

On a beautiful,<br />\nsunny, 80 degree day the Blue<br />\nJays blew away third ranked<br />\nMaryland 14-9 in front of an<br />\noverflow Homecoming crowd.<br />\nAnd, thanks to Hobart's 16-13<br />\nvictory over Syracuse, Hopkins<br />\nreturned to where they belong,<br />\nthe nation's top ranked team.<br />\nThe Terps didn't go down<br />\neasy though. They broke ahead<br />\nearly and were still tied in the<br />\nthird quarter, but finally fell<br />\nvictim to too much Hopkins<br />\ntalent and too much Hopkins<br />\ndepth.<br />\nMaryland has been winning<br />\nthis year with a very simple<br />\nformula\u2014ball control. Faceoff<br />\nman Todd Ensor won nearly 80<br />\npercent of his attempts going<br />\ninto Saturday's game, thus giving his offense the ball a<br />\ndisproportionate amount of<br />\ntime. That was before he ran in<br />\nto Hopkins and Joe Rzempoluch.<br />\nThe two met at midfield 27<br />\ntimes, and Rzempoluch won<br />\nsomewhere between ten to thirteen of them, depending upon<br />\nwhom you asked. This virtual<br />\nsplit took Maryland out of their<br />\ngame, and was the key to the<br />\nHopkins victory. \"I've been<br />\nreading all week about Todd<br />\nEnsor,\" said coach Don Zimmerman,\"but our boj,sure did<br />\na great job today. l'be never<br />\nseen him so pumped up.\"<br />\nHow did Rzempoluch get so<br />\ngood, so fast? It seems that a<br />\nweek's work with Dean of Admissions/former faceoff god<br />\nJerry Schnydman turned the<br />\nsophomore from a better than<br />\naverage specialist (58 percent<br />\nsuccessful this year) into a<br />\nplayer who could disrupt a<br />\nwhole team's offense.<br />\nThe Jays simply have too<br />\nmany guns to be beaten when<br />\n<br />\nillortok.`4\u2022-t<br />\n\u2022 \u2022. ,, ti\u2022<br />\n<br />\ntstotog,<br />\n<br />\nmoomosika01110som 401000<br />\n<br />\n\u2022,\u2022<br />\n<br />\nJess Bunshaft<br />\n<br />\nBrian Wood puts a nail in the Terp coffin with this empty net goal late in the fourth quarter, his third score of the day.<br />\n<br />\nthey get enough chances.<br />\nMaryland's defensive plan consisted of sliding over towards<br />\nDel Dressel and Brian Wood<br />\nwhen each had the ball and the<br />\nstrategy blew up in the Terps'<br />\nfaces. The two were content to<br />\npass off and get everyone else<br />\ninto the act with perfect feeds.<br />\nDressel still ended up with three<br />\ngoals and three assists, while<br />\nWood did the same.<br />\nFor Wood, it was a typical<br />\ngame in what has been an<br />\natypical season for him.<br />\n<br />\nThough he may have been<br />\nflashier his first two seasons,<br />\nand he scored more goals, he<br />\nhas never been a better player,<br />\nand he showed the world why<br />\non Saturday. In 1986, every opponent has marked Wood with<br />\ntheir best defense and then<br />\nused the rest of the team to<br />\n<br />\nhelp out, much the same principle as a box-and-one in<br />\nbasketball. Instead of reacting<br />\nwith frustration and forcing<br />\nshots, Wood just sits back and<br />\ndraws the exra man, and then<br />\ndishes a perfect pass for an easy<br />\ngoal. \"Everyone's been saying<br />\n'What's wrong with Wood?',\"<br />\n<br />\nsays Zimmerman,\"and I keep<br />\ntelling them 'Nothing.' He's<br />\ngetting his goals, he's getting<br />\nhis assists. He's becoming patient. Wood's accepted his new<br />\nrole and how important he is to<br />\nthe team.\"<br />\nContinued on Page 22<br />\n<br />\nHopkins vs. Navy<br />\nWhere: Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium<br />\nWhen: Saturday, 2:00 p.m.<br />\nCoverage: WJHU,88.1 FM, pre-game beginning at 1:45 p.m.<br />\nPreview:<br />\n<br />\nA couple of weeks ago, Navy looked like the<br />\nupstart of '86 as they stormed out to an 8-0 start,<br />\ntheir best in twenty years. They've fallen back to<br />\nearth though, as they've since dropped consecutive<br />\ngames to Maryland and Virginia without putting<br />\nup much of a fight.<br />\nTomorrow is the Middies' season finale. They've<br />\nalready locked in a playoff berth, but they're in a<br />\nsomewhat precarious position. Navy is ranked<br />\nsixth, which means that should they drop just one<br />\nmore spot, they will have to play an extra postseason game in this year's new format. Expect the<br />\nJays to encounter a fired-up, hard checking team.<br />\nNavy's backbone is midfielder Glenn Miles, and<br />\nhow well he plays will determine whether they can<br />\npull off an upset In their eight wins Miles totaled<br />\n12 goals and 24 assists, but in their two losses he<br />\nhad a combined total of 1 goal and 4 assists. He's<br />\nhardly a one-man team though, as the Middies have<br />\nsome other excellent players such as freshman attack men Tom Hunzsche and Paul Basile and sophomore goalie Joe Dounely.<br />\nWhen the two schools met in '85, Hopkins blew<br />\nthe Midshipmen out of the water, 23-10.

It's not that Hopkins<br />\nwas beaten by a superior team,<br />\nit's just that the little error<br />\ngremlin decided to show up and<br />\ntake hold of some of the Blue<br />\nJays' usually fine fielders for<br />\none afternoon. Credit must be<br />\ngiven to the Jays, however, for<br />\nbouncing back. Since the loss<br />\nthey have regrouped and are<br />\ncontinuing their winning ways,<br />\nnow enjoying a modest three<br />\ngame streak of victories.<br />\nWhile most of Hopkins was<br />\nsweating it out taking their<br />\nMCATs last Saturday, the<br />\n\u2022 baseball team was cruising to a<br />\n5-1 victory over Gettysburg<br />\nKevin Thomas Tully<br />\nin the first game of a<br />\ndoubleheader. The Blue Jays Craig Brooks has been superb all season, but he had a tough time in the<br />\nscored runs in the first three in- field last Saturday against Gettysburg.<br />\n- for the Blue Jays<br />\nIn Game 2, the errors piled afternoonnings and were led by Jon<br />\ndespite<br />\ntheir (Brooks')<br />\nwho,<br />\nMeltzer who went 2 for 2 with up like dust bunnies under a<br />\nfielding,<br />\nshould have<br />\nhorrid<br />\nHopkins<br />\ncommitting<br />\nan uncharacteristic 2 singles; bed, with<br />\nsummon<br />\ntheir<br />\nable<br />\nto<br />\nbeen<br />\ntotal<br />\nof<br />\nsix.<br />\nThird<br />\na<br />\ngrand<br />\nhome<br />\nrun<br />\nthis from last year's<br />\nking.

The only Gettysburg run the same inning on consecutive murdered by the Bullets, 11-3.<br />\ncame on an error by shortstop batters! Sophomore Brian Mur- (Incidentally, this was the first<br />\nDave Prsenicska in the 7th; phy, making his first start since loss for Hopkins in over three<br />\nmeaningless, as the game was injuring his shoulder three weeks.)<br />\nHopkins returned home the<br />\nalready won, but it was a harb- weeks ago, began the game by<br />\nvery<br />\nnext day and showed York<br />\ninger of the Blue Jay problems hitting the first batter with a<br />\nwhy they were ranked<br />\nCollege<br />\npitch. It was to be that kind of<br />\nin Game 2.<br />\n<br />\n7th in Division III, taking both<br />\ngames of a twinbill by scores of<br />\n5-1 (Game 1)and 5-0(Game 2).<br />\nStill smarting from their second<br />\ngame tragedy at Gettysburg,<br />\nthe Black and Blue bats continued to be un-Hopkins like<br />\nquiet in the first inning. Senior<br />\nWillie \"The Rock\" Raedle<br />\nwoke everyone up in the 2nd by<br />\nblasting a 440 ft home run over<br />\nthe right centerfield fence. This<br />\nball would have gone out in any<br />\nmajor-league ball park. \"The<br />\nRock,\" normally a singles hitter, had this to say about his<br />\nrock(et), \"Whenever I go up to<br />\nthe plate, I'm just looking to hit<br />\nthe ball hard, and if I get under<br />\nit and it goes out, well hey,<br />\nthat's just extra.\" Hopkins' big<br />\ninning was the 4th when they<br />\nscored 3 runs to ice the game<br />\nfor righthander Peter Blohm<br />\n(7-0), who turned in another<br />\ntypical Blohm performance: 8<br />\nK's in 7 innings.<br />\nIn Game 2, Dave Psenicska<br />\nraised his record to 6 wins<br />\nagainst no defeats, pitching his<br />\nfirst shutout of the season, as<br />\nthe Jays coasted to a 5-0 victory<br />\nover York. Although Hopkins<br />\nonly managed 3 hits they made<br />\nthe most of errors by York College and scored 4 runs in their<br />\nlast two at bats for the win. Jon<br />\nMeltzer got the game winning<br />\nRBI, lining a two out single to<br />\nright to score Mike Goudy who<br />\nhad reached earlier on an error.<br />\nIn Wednesday's action at<br />\nHomewood, the Blue Jays<br />\nhumbled Mount Saint Mary's<br />\nCollege 9-1. Leading 4-1 after<br />\n<br />\n7 innings on a cold and rainy<br />\nday, Hopkins erupted for 5<br />\nruns in the bottom of the 8th,<br />\nled by Scotty Burns' 2-RBI<br />\ndouble. Andy Karetsky also<br />\ncame up with a pinch hit double and an RBI in the inning.<br />\nOnce again Peter Blohm got the<br />\nwin, registering a ho-hum 8<br />\nmore strikeouts in 8 innings.<br />\nMark Campbell further<br />\nlowered his E.R.A. in a ninth<br />\ninning mop up job, striking out,<br />\nthe final two batters to end the<br />\ngame.<br />\nDiamond Dust: Hopkins'<br />\noverall record now stands at 26<br />\nwins with only 2 losses. It seems<br />\nthat the local media has picked<br />\nup on \"baseball fever\" here at<br />\nHopkins. There have been<br />\nstories in the Evening Sun as<br />\nwell as a feature on Channel 2<br />\nthis week, and Channel 13<br />\nshowed highlights of Wednesday's win over Mount St.<br />\nMarys. It looks like somebody<br />\nmust be reading the NewsLetter....Tom Finegan, Lenny<br />\nGuarna, Dave Psenicska, and<br />\nScotty Burns all broke out of<br />\nhitting slumps in the game versus Mt.

It was a very<br />\nclose game that could have<br />\ngone either way, but the lady<br />\nLaxers' unfailing determination<br />\nmade the difference. After the<br />\nfrustration of losing to both<br />\nWashington College and<br />\nWestern Maryland by one goal,<br />\nthe team worked together and<br />\nremained intense throughout<br />\nthe game to pull out the victory.<br />\nMaggie Schmidt's five shots<br />\nfrom behind the goal and two<br />\nassists were an essential factor<br />\nin the Lady Jays' victory.<br />\nThe Lady Jays started off<br />\ntheir season with scrimmages<br />\nagainst Ithaca College. Having<br />\nhad the advantage of full field<br />\nplay before these matches, the<br />\nteam held their own. Their<br />\n24-10 victory against Notre<br />\nDame in their first official game<br />\nof the season further boosted<br />\ntheir confidence. The tables<br />\nturned in the game against<br />\nUMBC, a top ranked division<br />\nII team. Although the Lady<br />\nJays' outshot their opponent,<br />\ninexperience in goal and lack of<br />\nteam speed became a factor in<br />\nthe 11-7 loss.<br />\nThe next games also took adHopkins'<br />\nvantage \u2022 of<br />\nweaknesses in goal and in<br />\nspeed. The Hopkins scoring<br />\npercentage was one of the<br />\nhighest its has ever been, yet the<br />\nother teams managed to score<br />\nten goals per game. Despite a<br />\n20-13 loss to Haverford, the<br />\nHopkins coaches were pleased<br />\n<br />\nwith the game. They felt it was<br />\none of the best displays of offensive teamwork they have<br />\nseen at Hopkins in a long time.<br />\nThere were seven assisted goals<br />\nin the game.<br />\nThe turning point in the<br />\nseason came when Hopkins<br />\ndefeated Widener 9-7 having<br />\nbeen at a 4-5 deficit at halftime. The Jays continued their<br />\nwinning ways by overpowering<br />\nGoucher 11-7. Goucher had<br />\none of the best goalkeepers the<br />\nLadies have come against this<br />\nyear. Hood was next, Hopkins<br />\nglided through a 20-4 victory.<br />\nBeating a team like Swarthmore<br />\nwas a great way to end the official game schedule. It was only a matter of time before<br />\nHopkins would be the victor in<br />\na one point match.<br />\nThe Lady Jays will be going<br />\nto the Maryland State Tournamane this weekend at<br />\nGoucher. Hopefully they will<br />\ncontinue their winning streak<br />\nand return with the state title.<br />\n<br />\nThe players will also have the<br />\nopportunity to compete as individuals and be selected to one<br />\nof three Baltimore All-College<br />\nteams which then will play May<br />\n10-11 in the Southern District<br />\nLacrosse Tournament at<br />\nGoucher College.<br />\nThe junior varsity ended<br />\ntheir season in a tie against<br />\nWestern Maryland.

He<br />\ncould probably start at any<br />\nother school, but at Hopkins<br />\nthere aren't many openings for<br />\na starting attackman, nor will<br />\nthere be one for two more years<br />\nbarring injury.

That<br />\nmeant the SAC Executive Board\u2014which<br />\ndraws up the list\u2014had to go back to the<br />\ndrawing board.<br />\n\u2022 Several people claimed that deserving<br />\nnames were left off the list the first time,<br />\nbut the Executive Board couldn't simply add on names since the total number<br />\nof recipients is limited to five percent of<br />\nthe senior class. So instead of trying to<br />\ntake some people off and put others on<br />\n(a nasty, distasteful business to put it<br />\nmildly), the board decided to raise the<br />\nthreshold of activity required to receive<br />\nan award. Hence, the new (shorter) list.<br />\nNone of this is something new. Two<br />\nyears ago, the council tabled the list and<br />\nrequested written biographies of every<br />\nrecipient. A week later\u2014biographies in<br />\nhand\u2014the council voted down the list<br />\nagain. Senior Class President Mike Kun<br />\nthen said the list had to be passed that<br />\nnight, lest it not be included in the<br /><br />\nDuring the most recent<br />\npresidential race, there were<br />\ncharges that the selection of<br />\ncommittee chairmen was based<br />\nvery heavily cohnacirrni<br />\noneynisomf;csourng:<br /><br />\ngraduation program. So the council adjourned and reconvened (so it could<br />\nreconsider the list), and then passed it.<br />\nmittees obtained their positions<br />\nThe debate got so ugly at one point that because<br />\nthey knew someone on<br />\none council member told another one to Student Council. There have<br />\ndo something wholly unnatural (and also been tirades in the Newsphysically impossible). Student Council Letter to the same effect, claimthat the council \"is the<br />\ni promised the<br />\nPresident-elect Jon Lanaing<br />\nhome<br />\nof nepotism on a grand<br />\nprocess would be reformed.<br />\nscale.\" Furthermore, this was<br />\nThe result of that reformation was a<br />\ncurious decision by the Executive Board<br />\nthat the SAC General Assembly and the<br />\nStudent Council could not consider<br />\nspecific names on the list. That resulted somehow connected with the<br />\nin an almost comical moment this year: problem of apathy which exists<br />\non this campus. I would like to<br />\ndiscussions of individuals were by refute this and issue a<br />\ncredentials only, even though the iden- challenge.<br />\ntity of the subject was often painfully<br />\nFirst, I believe that the Council committee chairs are chosen<br />\nobvious.<br />\nThe awards' tradition caused us to say with scrutiny. It may well occur<br />\nthat someone who has had a lot<br />\nearlier this year that they simply ought of<br />\nexperience with the council<br />\nto be eliminated. It just isn't worth all or council-related services<br />\nthis trouble. Nor are we alone. We've might have a slight advantage<br />\ntalked to several recipients this year who in applying for a position; but<br />\nthink the whole thing is silly, and a few this does not come from a belief<br />\nwho even considered asking that their that the council insists on being<br />\na self-perpetuating body. To<br />\nnames be taken off the list.<br />\nthe contrary, it is merely a show<br />\nDuring the squabble two years ago, by the individual who is applyKun lamented that the awards had ing for the position that they<br />\nbecome \"a chance to stab a few friends have some competence and enin the back and sling a little mud.\" We thusiasm for Hopkins and for<br />\na good job. If someone<br />\ndon't see the need for that kind of doing<br />\nhad an equally good record in<br />\nopportunity.<br />\ntheir fraternity/sorority or in<br /><br />\nmark komisky<br /><br />\nGil-vering<br />\nIt's no secret the campus will look far<br />\ndifferent in, say, five years. What is in<br />\ndoubt is the extent to which those<br />\nchanges will benefit students.<br />\nObviously, students will benefit as<br />\nmuch as everyone else from the academic<br />\nimprovements brought about by renovation. But an equally important question<br />\nis how much the social lives of students<br />\nwill improve. Most of the construction<br />\nalready planned (or already underway)<br />\nis for places such as Mergenthaler/Jenkins, Ames and a new Physics<br />\nand Astronomy building\u2014places that<br />\ndon't effect the non-academic lives of<br />\nstudents very much.<br />\nEven the changes slated for Gilman<br />\nHall\u2014the one significantly nonacademic building where renovations are<br />\nalready in the works\u2014are mainly general<br />\nimprovements like lighting and heating<br />\nand moving the academic deans into the<br />\nbuilding.<br />\nBut in defending the recent tuition increase to the Student Council Wednesday, University President Steven Muller<br />\nbrought up an idea we think would<br />\nbenefit the average Hopkins student:<br />\nbuilding a connection between Gilman<br />\nand Levering halls,<br />\nThe proposal is far from novel. Such<br />\na plan has been bouncing around for<br />\nyears, although it has always been in that<br />\neternal \"very, very tentative\" stage administrators love so dearly. The idea is<br />\ngenerally to use the area as a true student union, with things such as corn-<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\nor at least apprehensive about<br />\napplying for a position if they<br />\nhave not ben involved with the<br />\ncouncil before. As a freshman,<br />\nI applied for and got the posilion of Education Chairman<br />\nfor my sophomore year. At that<br />\ntime, I had no experience in the<br />\narea but demonstrated a willingness to work hard and an interest and enthusiasm for the<br />\ncommittee. It is for this reason<br />\nthat I believe I got the job, for<br />\nI knew surely few members of<br /><br />\nmunal areas, restaurants or cafes, shops,<br />\nbowling alleys, etc.<br />\nBut while the idea has been around<br />\nforever, the planned renovations for<br />\nGilman make the idea particularly important just now.<br />\nWhen Dean of the School of Arts and<br />\nSciences George Fisher and Dean of the<br />\nG.W.C. Whiting School of Engineering<br />\nV. David VandeLinde move into<br />\nGilman, the Gilman Coffee Shop(hitherto a valuable meeting place for students)<br />\nwill die. Whether that's justified or not<br />\nis irrelevant\u2014if we were Fisher or<br />\nVandeLinde we wouldn't want the<br />\nGilman Coffee Shop just outside of our<br />\noffices either.<br />\nIt's hardly news to note that this campus isn't exactly overflowing with places<br />\nfor students to congregate even now.<br />\nThat situation will worsen when the Coffee Shop closes. But building some sort<br />\nof true student union between Gilman<br />\nand Levering would change all that. Doing so, of course, will require a sacrifice<br />\nfrom the administration. A student<br />\nunion won't win academic awards; it<br />\nwon't attract world-famous scholars; it<br />\nwon't enable the University to conduct<br />\nmore research.<br />\nBut making life more livable for<br />\nstudents (and, for that matter, for administrators, staff members and faculty<br />\nmembers) is a worthwhile goal. And<br />\nwhen Gilman is renovated, one of the<br />\nbetter ways to do that will be to build a<br />\nstudent union.<br /><br />\nanother SAC group or for that<br />\nmatter could justify their work<br />\nin some task outside the<br />\nUniversity, I would feel that<br />\nthey were equally qualified. The<br />\nfact that many people in the<br />\npositions come from the council comes from the fact that<br />\nthey hear and know of the positions which are open at the time<br />\nand that their abilities are also<br />\nknown by the interviewers. It is<br />\nfor this reason that I wrote this<br />\narticle.<br />\nI understand that many people might not know of the positions which are open and that<br />\nmany might not feel qualified<br /><br />\nthe student government at<br />\nHopkins. It is this same spirit<br />\nwhich I wish to use in selecting<br />\nthe committee chairmen for the<br />\n'87-'87 school year.<br />\nAs for the positions which<br />\nare open, at the moment there<br />\nare five major committees on<br />\nthe council which need<br />\nchairmen for next year. The<br />\nStudent Services Committee is<br />\nby its name that committee<br />\nwhich works to find and create<br />\nservices for students. This committee used to be known under<br />\nthe title of student life as it is<br />\nconcerned with all aspects of<br />\nstudent life and how it can be<br />\nimproved. Some past examples<br />\nof this committee's work include the Rotunda, BWI airport, and White Marsh shuttles<br />\nas well as trips and after exam<br />\namenities. For more information you should contact Dave<br />\nShade or Stephanie Weissman,<br />\nthe co-chairmen.<br />\nThe Career Advising and<br />\nPlacement Committee deals<br />\nprimarily with seminars on<br />\nvarious types of opportunities<br />\nwhich<br />\noccur<br />\nafter<br />\ngraduation\u2014i.e., careers in<br />\npublic health, international<br />\ntrade, and graduate schools.<br />\nThe committee next year will<br />\nalso work on an internship program for Hopkins students.

And there, he said,<br />\nIrwin \"gave him the axe.\" Irwin told Chisolm his course was<br />\ncancelled due to budget cuts.<br />\nChisolm is angry, and plans to<br />\nfight the decision with the help<br />\nof his students.<br />\nAs a part-time lecturer,<br />\nChisolm's contract can be<br />\nrenewed or cancelled each year.<br />\nIrwin said that in addition to<br />\nChisolm, two other part-time<br />\ninstructors the writing seminars<br />\nwanted would also not be<br />\nteaching classes in the fall.<br />\n\"I'm sorry Richard is upset,<br />\nbut this is the kind of thing that<br />\noften happens in budget situations,\" Irwin said.

Interesting music was playing,<br />\nand the ambience had a pleasant feel. The costumes the<br />\nwaiters and waitresses wore<br />\nheightened the atmosphere.<br />\nWe were seated immediately<br />\nand menus were brought promptly. We ordered the Honey Wine<br />\n(2.75), a sweet honey-flavored<br />\nwhite wine, which we sipped<br />\nwhile we chose from a wide<br />\nrange of dishes. These included beef, lamb, chicken,<br />\nseafood, and vegetarian entrees. The menu described<br />\nEthiopian food to have two<br />\nmain ingredients: the first, Injera, is an unleavened sour<br />\ndough bread made of various<br />\ngrains and has a crepe-like consistency. The second is a spiced<br />\nstew which acts as a base for the<br />\nmeat or vegetable. Key Wat<br />\ncontains a spicy red hot pepper<br />\ncalled berbere and spicy butter<br />\nknown as Niter-Kibbeh. Alicha<br />\ncontains Niter-Kibbeh, plus<br />\ntumeric, green peppers and<br />\nspices.<br /><br />\nTwo of us shared Queen<br />\nSheba's dinner for two<br />\n($25.00), which included a<br />\nsampling of five of the main<br />\ndishes and homemade cottage<br />\ncheese and two vegetables,<br />\nwhich are served with all meals.<br />\nThe dinner also included two<br />\nglasses of Queen Sheba's wine,<br />\nwhich was similar to the Honey<br />\nWine. The dinner for four<br />\n($43.50) included even more.<br />\nMy other friends chose Yatakilt<br />\nKilikl ($5.50), fresh broccoli<br />\nand cauliflower simmered with<br />\ntomato, onion, and green pep- per, and Minchet Abish<br />\n($5.25), chopped top round<br />\ncooked with a combination of<br />\nseasonings and onions. Our<br />\nsampling of Doro Wat, Lega<br />\nTibs, Quanta Fitfit, and Yebeg<br />\nWat was overwhelming. The<br />\nspiciest were the Doro Wat,<br />\nchicken in berbere sauce, and<br />\nKitfo, Ethiopian steak tartare.<br />\nThe Lega Tibs, Ethiopian style<br />\nShish-Kebob, and Quanta Fitfit, seasoned beef cubes mixed<br />\nwith Injera, were my favorites.<br />\nThe Yebeg Wat was a mild<br />\nlamb and berbere dish which<br />\nwas also very pleasing. Our two<br />\n\"vegetables were lentil bean dip<br />\nand delicately seasoned<br />\ntomatoes.<br />\nThe food was brought in serving bowls on two giant silver<br />\nplatters lined with lnjera. More<br />\nInjera was served on another<br />\nplate, and it became apparent<br />\nthat we were to use the bread in<br /><br />\nplace of utensils. This proved to<br />\nbe most challenging and very<br />\nfun. Its mild flavor helped to<br />\nbalance the highly seasoned entrees. The homemade cottage<br />\ncheese was the best I had ever<br />\ntasted. It was impossible for us<br />\nto finish the enormous amount<br />\nof food which crowded the<br />\ntable. For those interested in<br />\nordering specific entrees instead<br />\nof the elaborate dinners listed<br />\nabove, prices ranged from $5 to<br />\n$7. Salads ran from $1.75 to<br />\n$2.50. Only two appetizers were<br />\nlisted, vegetable or meat Sambussa ($1.95, $2.25) which were<br />\npastry shells filled with a spicy<br />\nhot filling, and Azifa ($2.95), a<br />\ncold lentil bean and herb dip.<br />\nDessert was a choice of three<br />\ndifferent cakes, Carrot, German Chocolate, and :Devil's<br />\nFood. At $2.50 per slice, the<br />\nsmall portion of dry German<br />\nChocolate cake was a disappointment. The standard selection of beverages were available<br />\nas well as Ethiopian wines and<br />\ncoffee.<br />\nMy friends and I found<br />\nQueen of Sheba to be an inexpensive and pleasantly different<br />\ndining experience. Other than<br />\nhaving to wait a while for our<br />\nfood, the service was excellent,<br />\nand the food well worth waiting<br />\nfor. It is within walking<br />\ndistance from campus and was<br />\na nice change from the standard<br />\nfare in the area.<br /><br />\nA Chance to<br />\nStrike Out a Dean<br />\nSo you want to strike out<br />\na dean?

On a beautiful,<br />\nsunny, 80 degree day the Blue<br />\nJays blew away third ranked<br />\nMaryland 14-9 in front of an<br />\noverflow Homecoming crowd.<br />\nAnd, thanks to Hobart's 16-13<br />\nvictory over Syracuse, Hopkins<br />\nreturned to where they belong,<br />\nthe nation's top ranked team.<br />\nThe Terps didn't go down<br />\neasy though. They broke ahead<br />\nearly and were still tied in the<br />\nthird quarter, but finally fell<br />\nvictim to too much Hopkins<br />\ntalent and too much Hopkins<br />\ndepth.<br />\nMaryland has been winning<br />\nthis year with a very simple<br />\nformula\u2014ball control. Faceoff<br />\nman Todd Ensor won nearly 80<br />\npercent of his attempts going<br />\ninto Saturday's game, thus giving his offense the ball a<br />\ndisproportionate amount of<br />\ntime. That was before he ran in<br />\nto Hopkins and Joe Rzempoluch.<br />\nThe two met at midfield 27<br />\ntimes, and Rzempoluch won<br />\nsomewhere between ten to thirteen of them, depending upon<br />\nwhom you asked. This virtual<br />\nsplit took Maryland out of their<br />\ngame, and was the key to the<br />\nHopkins victory. \"I've been<br />\nreading all week about Todd<br />\nEnsor,\" said coach Don Zimmerman,\"but our boj,sure did<br />\na great job today. l'be never<br />\nseen him so pumped up.\"<br />\nHow did Rzempoluch get so<br />\ngood, so fast? It seems that a<br />\nweek's work with Dean of Admissions/former faceoff god<br />\nJerry Schnydman turned the<br />\nsophomore from a better than<br />\naverage specialist (58 percent<br />\nsuccessful this year) into a<br />\nplayer who could disrupt a<br />\nwhole team's offense.<br />\nThe Jays simply have too<br />\nmany guns to be beaten when<br /><br />\nillortok.`4\u2022-t<br />\n\u2022 \u2022. ,, ti\u2022<br /><br />\ntstotog,<br /><br />\nmoomosika01110som 401000<br /><br />\n\u2022,\u2022<br /><br />\nJess Bunshaft<br /><br />\nBrian Wood puts a nail in the Terp coffin with this empty net goal late in the fourth quarter, his third score of the day.<br /><br />\nthey get enough chances.<br />\nMaryland's defensive plan consisted of sliding over towards<br />\nDel Dressel and Brian Wood<br />\nwhen each had the ball and the<br />\nstrategy blew up in the Terps'<br />\nfaces. The two were content to<br />\npass off and get everyone else<br />\ninto the act with perfect feeds.<br />\nDressel still ended up with three<br />\ngoals and three assists, while<br />\nWood did the same.<br />\nFor Wood, it was a typical<br />\ngame in what has been an<br />\natypical season for him.<br /><br />\nThough he may have been<br />\nflashier his first two seasons,<br />\nand he scored more goals, he<br />\nhas never been a better player,<br />\nand he showed the world why<br />\non Saturday. In 1986, every opponent has marked Wood with<br />\ntheir best defense and then<br />\nused the rest of the team to<br /><br />\nhelp out, much the same principle as a box-and-one in<br />\nbasketball. Instead of reacting<br />\nwith frustration and forcing<br />\nshots, Wood just sits back and<br />\ndraws the exra man, and then<br />\ndishes a perfect pass for an easy<br />\ngoal. \"Everyone's been saying<br />\n'What's wrong with Wood?',\"<br /><br />\nsays Zimmerman,\"and I keep<br />\ntelling them 'Nothing.' He's<br />\ngetting his goals, he's getting<br />\nhis assists. He's becoming patient. Wood's accepted his new<br />\nrole and how important he is to<br />\nthe team.\"<br />\nContinued on Page 22<br /><br />\nHopkins vs. Navy<br />\nWhere: Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium<br />\nWhen: Saturday, 2:00 p.m.<br />\nCoverage: WJHU,88.1 FM, pre-game beginning at 1:45 p.m.<br />\nPreview:<br /><br />\nA couple of weeks ago, Navy looked like the<br />\nupstart of '86 as they stormed out to an 8-0 start,<br />\ntheir best in twenty years. They've fallen back to<br />\nearth though, as they've since dropped consecutive<br />\ngames to Maryland and Virginia without putting<br />\nup much of a fight.<br />\nTomorrow is the Middies' season finale. They've<br />\nalready locked in a playoff berth, but they're in a<br />\nsomewhat precarious position. Navy is ranked<br />\nsixth, which means that should they drop just one<br />\nmore spot, they will have to play an extra postseason game in this year's new format. Expect the<br />\nJays to encounter a fired-up, hard checking team.<br />\nNavy's backbone is midfielder Glenn Miles, and<br />\nhow well he plays will determine whether they can<br />\npull off an upset In their eight wins Miles totaled<br />\n12 goals and 24 assists, but in their two losses he<br />\nhad a combined total of 1 goal and 4 assists. He's<br />\nhardly a one-man team though, as the Middies have<br />\nsome other excellent players such as freshman attack men Tom Hunzsche and Paul Basile and sophomore goalie Joe Dounely.<br />\nWhen the two schools met in '85, Hopkins blew<br />\nthe Midshipmen out of the water, 23-10.

It's not that Hopkins<br />\nwas beaten by a superior team,<br />\nit's just that the little error<br />\ngremlin decided to show up and<br />\ntake hold of some of the Blue<br />\nJays' usually fine fielders for<br />\none afternoon. Credit must be<br />\ngiven to the Jays, however, for<br />\nbouncing back. Since the loss<br />\nthey have regrouped and are<br />\ncontinuing their winning ways,<br />\nnow enjoying a modest three<br />\ngame streak of victories.<br />\nWhile most of Hopkins was<br />\nsweating it out taking their<br />\nMCATs last Saturday, the<br />\n\u2022 baseball team was cruising to a<br />\n5-1 victory over Gettysburg<br />\nKevin Thomas Tully<br />\nin the first game of a<br />\ndoubleheader. The Blue Jays Craig Brooks has been superb all season, but he had a tough time in the<br />\nscored runs in the first three in- field last Saturday against Gettysburg.<br />\n- for the Blue Jays<br />\nIn Game 2, the errors piled afternoonnings and were led by Jon<br />\ndespite<br />\ntheir (Brooks')<br />\nwho,<br />\nMeltzer who went 2 for 2 with up like dust bunnies under a<br />\nfielding,<br />\nshould have<br />\nhorrid<br />\nHopkins<br />\ncommitting<br />\nan uncharacteristic 2 singles; bed, with<br />\nsummon<br />\ntheir<br />\nable<br />\nto<br />\nbeen<br />\ntotal<br />\nof<br />\nsix.<br />\nThird<br />\na<br />\ngrand<br />\nhome<br />\nrun<br />\nthis from last year's<br />\nking.

The only Gettysburg run the same inning on consecutive murdered by the Bullets, 11-3.<br />\ncame on an error by shortstop batters! Sophomore Brian Mur- (Incidentally, this was the first<br />\nDave Prsenicska in the 7th; phy, making his first start since loss for Hopkins in over three<br />\nmeaningless, as the game was injuring his shoulder three weeks.)<br />\nHopkins returned home the<br />\nalready won, but it was a harb- weeks ago, began the game by<br />\nvery<br />\nnext day and showed York<br />\ninger of the Blue Jay problems hitting the first batter with a<br />\nwhy they were ranked<br />\nCollege<br />\npitch. It was to be that kind of<br />\nin Game 2.<br /><br />\n7th in Division III, taking both<br />\ngames of a twinbill by scores of<br />\n5-1 (Game 1)and 5-0(Game 2).<br />\nStill smarting from their second<br />\ngame tragedy at Gettysburg,<br />\nthe Black and Blue bats continued to be un-Hopkins like<br />\nquiet in the first inning. Senior<br />\nWillie \"The Rock\" Raedle<br />\nwoke everyone up in the 2nd by<br />\nblasting a 440 ft home run over<br />\nthe right centerfield fence. This<br />\nball would have gone out in any<br />\nmajor-league ball park. \"The<br />\nRock,\" normally a singles hitter, had this to say about his<br />\nrock(et), \"Whenever I go up to<br />\nthe plate, I'm just looking to hit<br />\nthe ball hard, and if I get under<br />\nit and it goes out, well hey,<br />\nthat's just extra.\" Hopkins' big<br />\ninning was the 4th when they<br />\nscored 3 runs to ice the game<br />\nfor righthander Peter Blohm<br />\n(7-0), who turned in another<br />\ntypical Blohm performance: 8<br />\nK's in 7 innings.<br />\nIn Game 2, Dave Psenicska<br />\nraised his record to 6 wins<br />\nagainst no defeats, pitching his<br />\nfirst shutout of the season, as<br />\nthe Jays coasted to a 5-0 victory<br />\nover York. Although Hopkins<br />\nonly managed 3 hits they made<br />\nthe most of errors by York College and scored 4 runs in their<br />\nlast two at bats for the win. Jon<br />\nMeltzer got the game winning<br />\nRBI, lining a two out single to<br />\nright to score Mike Goudy who<br />\nhad reached earlier on an error.<br />\nIn Wednesday's action at<br />\nHomewood, the Blue Jays<br />\nhumbled Mount Saint Mary's<br />\nCollege 9-1. Leading 4-1 after<br /><br />\n7 innings on a cold and rainy<br />\nday, Hopkins erupted for 5<br />\nruns in the bottom of the 8th,<br />\nled by Scotty Burns' 2-RBI<br />\ndouble. Andy Karetsky also<br />\ncame up with a pinch hit double and an RBI in the inning.<br />\nOnce again Peter Blohm got the<br />\nwin, registering a ho-hum 8<br />\nmore strikeouts in 8 innings.<br />\nMark Campbell further<br />\nlowered his E.R.A. in a ninth<br />\ninning mop up job, striking out,<br />\nthe final two batters to end the<br />\ngame.<br />\nDiamond Dust: Hopkins'<br />\noverall record now stands at 26<br />\nwins with only 2 losses. It seems<br />\nthat the local media has picked<br />\nup on \"baseball fever\" here at<br />\nHopkins. There have been<br />\nstories in the Evening Sun as<br />\nwell as a feature on Channel 2<br />\nthis week, and Channel 13<br />\nshowed highlights of Wednesday's win over Mount St.<br />\nMarys.

It was a very<br />\nclose game that could have<br />\ngone either way, but the lady<br />\nLaxers' unfailing determination<br />\nmade the difference. After the<br />\nfrustration of losing to both<br />\nWashington College and<br />\nWestern Maryland by one goal,<br />\nthe team worked together and<br />\nremained intense throughout<br />\nthe game to pull out the victory.<br />\nMaggie Schmidt's five shots<br />\nfrom behind the goal and two<br />\nassists were an essential factor<br />\nin the Lady Jays' victory.<br />\nThe Lady Jays started off<br />\ntheir season with scrimmages<br />\nagainst Ithaca College. Having<br />\nhad the advantage of full field<br />\nplay before these matches, the<br />\nteam held their own. Their<br />\n24-10 victory against Notre<br />\nDame in their first official game<br />\nof the season further boosted<br />\ntheir confidence. The tables<br />\nturned in the game against<br />\nUMBC, a top ranked division<br />\nII team. Although the Lady<br />\nJays' outshot their opponent,<br />\ninexperience in goal and lack of<br />\nteam speed became a factor in<br />\nthe 11-7 loss.<br />\nThe next games also took adHopkins'<br />\nvantage \u2022 of<br />\nweaknesses in goal and in<br />\nspeed. The Hopkins scoring<br />\npercentage was one of the<br />\nhighest its has ever been, yet the<br />\nother teams managed to score<br />\nten goals per game. Despite a<br />\n20-13 loss to Haverford, the<br />\nHopkins coaches were pleased<br /><br />\nwith the game. They felt it was<br />\none of the best displays of offensive teamwork they have<br />\nseen at Hopkins in a long time.<br />\nThere were seven assisted goals<br />\nin the game.<br />\nThe turning point in the<br />\nseason came when Hopkins<br />\ndefeated Widener 9-7 having<br />\nbeen at a 4-5 deficit at halftime. The Jays continued their<br />\nwinning ways by overpowering<br />\nGoucher 11-7. Goucher had<br />\none of the best goalkeepers the<br />\nLadies have come against this<br />\nyear. Hood was next, Hopkins<br />\nglided through a 20-4 victory.<br />\nBeating a team like Swarthmore<br />\nwas a great way to end the official game schedule.

It was<br />\nperhaps Kelly's best outing of<br /><br />\nthe year, and it came in front<br />\nof the biggest crowd he's ever<br />\nfaced. \"Sure I was nervous,\"<br />\nhe say, \"I could only sleep in<br />\ntwo hour intervals the night<br />\nbefore. Once I got the first goal<br />\nI just settled down and played.\"<br />\nIhm is the definition of the<br />\nconsumate role player. He<br />\ncould probably start at any<br />\nother school, but at Hopkins<br />\nthere aren't many openings for<br />\na starting attackman, nor will<br />\nthere be one for two more years<br />\nbarring injury. Thus, Zimmerman uses Ihm as a sub and as<br />\na fourth attackman in man-up<br />\nsituations. Despite this limited<br />\nplaying time, Ihm has been productive as he had two nice<br />\nassists on Saturday, giving him<br />\nnine points for the year. \"Give<br />\nhim credit; he's accepted his<br />\nrole and played very well,\" says<br />\nZimmerman.<br />\nThe Jays defense got off to<br />\na shaky opening, but regrouped<br />\nto turn in a good game.

He would eventually get<br />\nthe ball on the right of the<br />\nTerp's net, where he drew half<br />\nthe defense. Instead of forcing<br />\nsomething, Dressel dished off<br />\nto Kelly, who was in the middle about 17 yds. from the cage<br />\nand wide open. The freshman<br />\nproceeded to fire home a bound<br />\nshot that put Hopkins on the<br />\nboard just 1:13 into the game.<br />\nFor Kelly, it is now becoming<br />\na habit to get that big, early<br />\ngoal.<br />\nIt didn't take long for<br />\nMaryland to strike back. Only<br />\n12 seconds as a matter of fact.<br />\nIt came on a Chris Bullen<br />\nbounce shot from the left that<br />\nmaybe could've been stopped.<br />\nHopkins hardly flinched,<br />\nthough, as they quickly picked<br />\nup a tripping penalty on the<br />\nTerps and converted for an extraman goal.
