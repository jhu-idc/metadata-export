Worthington had four outs and five assists<br />\nto his credit without an error. He<br />\nhandled himself in excellent form<br />\nand scooped up everything that<br />\ncame his way in faultless manner.<br />\nOn two occasions he ran out into<br />\ncenter field and made sensational<br />\ncatches of high flies. Phythyon,<br />\nplaying in the outfield in \"Babe\"<br />\nEwing's absence, made a beautiful<br />\ncatch of Bourland's long fly in the<br />\nseventh.<br />\nOne of the most pleasing features<br />\nof the game was the fielding of<br />\nHowell at first. When it was first<br />\nannounced that Butler would not be<br />\nable to play, a serious problem confronted the coach, but Howell's playing on Saturday showed Hopkins<br />\nthat they have a man who is able to<br />\nmeet the emergency. Howell accepted fifteen chances without an indication of a fumble. Howell also<br />\nfigured in two double plays, both of<br />\nwhich were largely instrumental in<br />\nkeeping the score of Washington<br />\nCollege to one tally. \u2022<br />\nMore encouraging, however, than<br />\nthe playing of individuals was the<br />\nmachine-like precision that accompanied the playing of the whole<br />\nteam.

The lectures, which dealt<br />\nwith \"The Reviewers,- .\"Hazlitt,\"<br />\n\"Lamb\" and \"Landor,- respectively,<br />\nwere easily the most interesting of<br />\nthe course, partly because the subjects made it possible for Sir Walter to express his own views and<br />\nimpressions, and partly because he<br />\nseemed to take an even keener delight in delivering them than in discussing the topics chosen for the<br />\nfirst two talks.<br />\nThe lecture on \"The Reviewers\"<br />\nwas by far the most original and<br />\nwitty of the six discussions. After<br />\ndealing briefly with the futility of a<br />\nlarge body of criticism, Sir Walter<br />\nselected .the critics of the early nineteenth century, and devoted his consideration exclusively to them and<br />\nto their work. His discourse<br />\nabounded in clever epigrams and<br />\nant phrases that embellished the<br />\nscholarly manner in which the subject was treated.<br />\nThe following lecture, which dealt<br />\nwith Hazlitt, proved of almost equal<br />\ninterest. The life, the personality<br />\nand the work of the delightful essayist were carefully considered, and<br />\nthe memory of a man who has been<br />\nall too effectually forgotten and become but a name even to many comparatively well read and thoroughly<br />\neducated people, was made fresh in<br />\nthe minds of the audience. Details<br />\nof the personal habits of Hazlitt<br />\nwere received with particular interest, for his character was in many<br />\nways a most amazing one.<br />\nOn Wednesday the speaker dealt<br />\nwith Charles Lamb, shyest and most<br />\nretiring of men, after first apologizing for dragging so thorough a<br />\nrecluse from his beloved retirement<br />\ninto the light of common day. The<br />\nlife of the writer was first discussed,<br />\nfollowing which his work, which<br />\nwas written late, and has aptly been<br />\ncalled a happy accident, received attention. The lecture was divided<br />\ninto three sub-heads, which concerned themselves with the sayings,<br />\nessays and letters of Lamb. Some<br />\nof the wittiest remarks of the famous punster were quoted, and several of his letters, among them one<br />\nto Mrs. Wordsworth, were read.<br />\nThe last lecture took for its subject Walter Savage Landor, a writer<br />\nwho, said Sir Walter, is liked by<br />\nmany, but enthusiastically loved and<br />\nextensively read by but very few.<br />\nThe fact that in Landor the man<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\nWorthington, ss<br />\nPorter, 2h<br />\nNoble, c<br />\nSutton, c. f<br />\nLednum, 1. f.<br />\nEgerton, 31)<br />\nHowell, Th<br />\nPhythyon, r. f<br />\nDefandorf, p<br />\nTotals........<br />\n<br />\nA.B.

By this<br />\ntime Hopkins had Navy on the<br />\njump.<br />\nTroxell was sent in to relieve<br />\nPrince. He almost immediately<br />\nreceived the ball on a pass, ran to<br />\nthe crease and scored Hopkins'<br />\nthird goal. The 'Varsity easily outplayed the midshipmen in this half,<br />\nwhich ended with the score 3 to I<br />\nin their favor.<br />\nIn the second period the battle<br />\nwas more of a nip-and-tuck affair,<br />\neach side managing to net one goal.<br />\nNavy scored first, the ball going<br />\npast Huck and high over Stuart's<br />\nshoulder. Soon after this Troxell<br />\nscored for Hopkins.<br />\nThe lineup:<br />\nNavy.<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nPosition.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough Tappan proved the star<br />\nof the meet, scoring nineteen points,<br />\nand Captain Connolly scored eight<br />\nmore for the Black and Blue, the<br />\nNavy track and field men gained a<br />\ndecisive victory over the crippled<br />\nHopkins team in the annual dual<br />\ncontest at Annapolis last Saturday<br />\nby the score of 58 to 30.* The first<br />\nrelay team were the only scorers for<br />\nHopkins besides these two stars.<br />\nTwo teams from each side enter,ed<br />\nthis one-Mile relay event, and the<br />\nfirst Hopkins four, consisting of<br />\nUhler, Straus, Binford and F. P.<br />\nHall, all of whom had already taken<br />\npart in other events, scored second<br />\nin the event, giving Hopkins three<br />\npoints to five.<br />\nHopkins entered the contest with<br />\na team very much crippled. The<br />\nrecent examinations were responsible<br />\nfor several losses, and two. or three<br />\nof the most reliable men were not in<br />\ngood condition. Wright, the most<br />\npromising sprinter on the squad,<br />\nwas suffering from a pulled muscle,<br />\nand did not make the trip; while<br />\nUhler and Binford were below their<br />\nusual marks.<br />\nBen Tappan piled up his nineteen points by winning both the<br />\nhigh and low hurdle races and the<br />\nhigh jump, and scoring second in<br />\nthe broad jump and tying with two<br />\nNavy men for second in the pole<br />\nvault. Connolly took first in the<br />\nboard jump and second in the high<br />\njump. A very close finish occurred<br />\nin the 440-yard run. The three<br />\nNavy men and F. P. Hall, of Hopkins, were closely bunched together<br />\nfor the last thirty yards, but Hall<br />\nwas only able to get third place.<br />\nSummary of events:<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\nCollege and Fraternity Stationery<br />\nBanquet and Dance Cards\u2014Invitations<br />\n<br />\nSI<br />\n<br />\nGNS KINDS<br />\n<br />\nJAS.

Fifty prominent educators from institutions of learning<br />\nin the East were welcomed at the<br />\nopening of the first session in the<br />\nDonovan Room by President Good<br />\nnow, who was introduced by Prof.<br />\nHenry Johnson, of Columbia University, and president of the Teachers' Association.<br />\nDr. Goodnow told the visiting<br />\ndelegates that he was glad to have<br />\nthem gather here, since Johns Hopkins has always been interested in<br />\nthe teaching of history and since he<br />\nhimself began his career as a teacher<br />\nof history some thirty years ago.<br />\nAt the conclusion of Dr. Goodnow's<br />\nremarks, papers were read showing<br />\nthe changes which have been made<br />\nin the method of teaching history<br />\nin many of the leading institutions<br />\nof the.East. It was pointed out that<br />\nthere was a tendency to compare<br />\npast events with incidents of today<br />\nin an effort to establish the relationship between them.<br />\nPapers were read by Dr. Thomas<br />\nH. Briggs, of Columbia, and Prof.<br />\nR. W. Kelsey, of Haverford University, as well as by several other<br />\nhistory teachers of prominence from<br />\ninstitutions in the East. In the<br />\nevening a dinner was given the<br />\ndelegates in the Donovan Room, at<br />\nwhich an address was made by Dr.<br />\nJ. M. Vincent of this University.<br />\nOn Saturday morning several<br />\ntopics were brought up for open<br />\ndiscussion at the meeting. PrOf.<br />\nCharles W. Spencer, of Princeton,<br />\nProf. Philip Dougherty, of the<br />\nPolytechnic Institute of Baltimore,<br />\nand Miss Louise J. Hedge, of the<br />\nBrooklyn Training School, discussed<br />\nvarious phases of educational work.<br />\nOne of the topics brought up was<br />\nthe \"Differentiation of History in<br />\nthe High School from History in<br />\nthe High School.\"<br />\n<br />\nHalf 1915 Hullabaloo in Printers' Hands.<br />\n<br />\nMore than half of the Hullabaloo<br />\nhas been in the hands of the printers<br />\nfor the past week or so, and the<br />\nBoard expects to start the proofreading as soon as the printers<br />\ncomplete their work. To allow several delinquent advertisers to get<br />\ntheir ads, in the book, the business<br />\ndepartment has decided to withhold<br />\none section for a few days longer.<br />\nAll of the art work has either been<br />\nhanded in or is expected to come<br />\nin during the next few days.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo will contain many<br />\ncuts of the new buildings at Homewood and also many cartoons characteristic of class-room occurrences.<br />\nThe section entitled 'Statistics\" will<br />\ncontain much interesting information. Another new feature of the<br />\nbook will be the distribution of college views throughout the advertising section.<br />\n<br />\nArt Editors of 1916\"Hullabaloo\"Elected.<br />\n<br />\nA meeting of the Board of Editors of the 1916 Hullabaloo, the primary purpose of which was to elect<br />\nart editors, was held recently at<br />\nEditor - in - Chief Tingley's home.<br />\nThe announcement of the Board<br />\nsome time ago that all candidates<br />\nfor the positions should submit<br />\nspecimens of their work and that<br />\nfrom the merits of these the editors<br />\nwould be elected_ brought forth unusual interest among the artists of<br />\nthe class, with the result that a large<br />\nnumber of sketches were submitted.<br />\nThe competition was close.

Such biographical matters as account of Ihe poet's marriage, or of the throwing of a cook<br />\nfrom the window, proved highly<br />\namusing, and illustrated the fact<br />\nthat even when Landor was a very<br />\nold man he preserved almost too<br />\nmuch of the impetuosity and<br />\nthoughtlessness that are customarily<br />\nattributed to youth.<br />\nAt the close of the last lecture,<br />\nand on the motion of Dr. Bright, of<br />\nthe graduate English department, a<br />\nvote of thanks was tendered for the<br />\ngenerous provision that made possible the Turnbull lectures, and also<br />\nto Sir Walter Raleigh for delivering the course in 1915.

Worthington had four outs and five assists<br />\nto his credit without an error. He<br />\nhandled himself in excellent form<br />\nand scooped up everything that<br />\ncame his way in faultless manner.<br />\nOn two occasions he ran out into<br />\ncenter field and made sensational<br />\ncatches of high flies. Phythyon,<br />\nplaying in the outfield in \"Babe\"<br />\nEwing's absence, made a beautiful<br />\ncatch of Bourland's long fly in the<br />\nseventh.<br />\nOne of the most pleasing features<br />\nof the game was the fielding of<br />\nHowell at first. When it was first<br />\nannounced that Butler would not be<br />\nable to play, a serious problem confronted the coach, but Howell's playing on Saturday showed Hopkins<br />\nthat they have a man who is able to<br />\nmeet the emergency. Howell accepted fifteen chances without an indication of a fumble. Howell also<br />\nfigured in two double plays, both of<br />\nwhich were largely instrumental in<br />\nkeeping the score of Washington<br />\nCollege to one tally. \u2022<br />\nMore encouraging, however, than<br />\nthe playing of individuals was the<br />\nmachine-like precision that accompanied the playing of the whole<br />\nteam.

The lectures, which dealt<br />\nwith \"The Reviewers,- .\"Hazlitt,\"<br />\n\"Lamb\" and \"Landor,- respectively,<br />\nwere easily the most interesting of<br />\nthe course, partly because the subjects made it possible for Sir Walter to express his own views and<br />\nimpressions, and partly because he<br />\nseemed to take an even keener delight in delivering them than in discussing the topics chosen for the<br />\nfirst two talks.<br />\nThe lecture on \"The Reviewers\"<br />\nwas by far the most original and<br />\nwitty of the six discussions. After<br />\ndealing briefly with the futility of a<br />\nlarge body of criticism, Sir Walter<br />\nselected .the critics of the early nineteenth century, and devoted his consideration exclusively to them and<br />\nto their work. His discourse<br />\nabounded in clever epigrams and<br />\nant phrases that embellished the<br />\nscholarly manner in which the subject was treated.<br />\nThe following lecture, which dealt<br />\nwith Hazlitt, proved of almost equal<br />\ninterest. The life, the personality<br />\nand the work of the delightful essayist were carefully considered, and<br />\nthe memory of a man who has been<br />\nall too effectually forgotten and become but a name even to many comparatively well read and thoroughly<br />\neducated people, was made fresh in<br />\nthe minds of the audience. Details<br />\nof the personal habits of Hazlitt<br />\nwere received with particular interest, for his character was in many<br />\nways a most amazing one.<br />\nOn Wednesday the speaker dealt<br />\nwith Charles Lamb, shyest and most<br />\nretiring of men, after first apologizing for dragging so thorough a<br />\nrecluse from his beloved retirement<br />\ninto the light of common day. The<br />\nlife of the writer was first discussed,<br />\nfollowing which his work, which<br />\nwas written late, and has aptly been<br />\ncalled a happy accident, received attention. The lecture was divided<br />\ninto three sub-heads, which concerned themselves with the sayings,<br />\nessays and letters of Lamb. Some<br />\nof the wittiest remarks of the famous punster were quoted, and several of his letters, among them one<br />\nto Mrs. Wordsworth, were read.<br />\nThe last lecture took for its subject Walter Savage Landor, a writer<br />\nwho, said Sir Walter, is liked by<br />\nmany, but enthusiastically loved and<br />\nextensively read by but very few.<br />\nThe fact that in Landor the man<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br /><br />\nWorthington, ss<br />\nPorter, 2h<br />\nNoble, c<br />\nSutton, c. f<br />\nLednum, 1. f.<br />\nEgerton, 31)<br />\nHowell, Th<br />\nPhythyon, r. f<br />\nDefandorf, p<br />\nTotals........<br /><br />\nA.B.

But the obvious teamwork, and the splendid<br />\nfeats of the 'Varsity's close defense, could not be equaled. The<br />\nwork of Stuart, Brooks and Leibensperger was especially commendable in this department, the<br />\nbeautiful stops of Stuart at goal<br />\nbringing forth many a cheer from<br />\nthe grandstand.<br />\nThe game was called shortly<br />\nafter 4 o'clock, and after the ball<br />\nhad see-sawed up and down the<br />\nfield, Hopkins scored the first tally<br />\nafter three minutes of play. The<br />\ngoal was a peculiar one, the ball<br />\nsuddenly rolling from a melee before the midshipmen's goal and just<br />\ncrossing the line as Manley, the<br />\nNavy goal-keeper. dragged it away<br />\nwith his stick.

Fifty prominent educators from institutions of learning<br />\nin the East were welcomed at the<br />\nopening of the first session in the<br />\nDonovan Room by President Good<br />\nnow, who was introduced by Prof.<br />\nHenry Johnson, of Columbia University, and president of the Teachers' Association.<br />\nDr. Goodnow told the visiting<br />\ndelegates that he was glad to have<br />\nthem gather here, since Johns Hopkins has always been interested in<br />\nthe teaching of history and since he<br />\nhimself began his career as a teacher<br />\nof history some thirty years ago.<br />\nAt the conclusion of Dr. Goodnow's<br />\nremarks, papers were read showing<br />\nthe changes which have been made<br />\nin the method of teaching history<br />\nin many of the leading institutions<br />\nof the.East. It was pointed out that<br />\nthere was a tendency to compare<br />\npast events with incidents of today<br />\nin an effort to establish the relationship between them.<br />\nPapers were read by Dr. Thomas<br />\nH. Briggs, of Columbia, and Prof.<br />\nR. W. Kelsey, of Haverford University, as well as by several other<br />\nhistory teachers of prominence from<br />\ninstitutions in the East. In the<br />\nevening a dinner was given the<br />\ndelegates in the Donovan Room, at<br />\nwhich an address was made by Dr.<br />\nJ. M. Vincent of this University.<br />\nOn Saturday morning several<br />\ntopics were brought up for open<br />\ndiscussion at the meeting. PrOf.<br />\nCharles W. Spencer, of Princeton,<br />\nProf. Philip Dougherty, of the<br />\nPolytechnic Institute of Baltimore,<br />\nand Miss Louise J. Hedge, of the<br />\nBrooklyn Training School, discussed<br />\nvarious phases of educational work.<br />\nOne of the topics brought up was<br />\nthe \"Differentiation of History in<br />\nthe High School from History in<br />\nthe High School.\"<br /><br />\nHalf 1915 Hullabaloo in Printers' Hands.<br /><br />\nMore than half of the Hullabaloo<br />\nhas been in the hands of the printers<br />\nfor the past week or so, and the<br />\nBoard expects to start the proofreading as soon as the printers<br />\ncomplete their work. To allow several delinquent advertisers to get<br />\ntheir ads, in the book, the business<br />\ndepartment has decided to withhold<br />\none section for a few days longer.<br />\nAll of the art work has either been<br />\nhanded in or is expected to come<br />\nin during the next few days.<br />\nThe Hullabaloo will contain many<br />\ncuts of the new buildings at Homewood and also many cartoons characteristic of class-room occurrences.<br />\nThe section entitled 'Statistics\" will<br />\ncontain much interesting information. Another new feature of the<br />\nbook will be the distribution of college views throughout the advertising section.<br /><br />\nArt Editors of 1916\"Hullabaloo\"Elected.<br /><br />\nA meeting of the Board of Editors of the 1916 Hullabaloo, the primary purpose of which was to elect<br />\nart editors, was held recently at<br />\nEditor - in - Chief Tingley's home.<br />\nThe announcement of the Board<br />\nsome time ago that all candidates<br />\nfor the positions should submit<br />\nspecimens of their work and that<br />\nfrom the merits of these the editors<br />\nwould be elected_ brought forth unusual interest among the artists of<br />\nthe class, with the result that a large<br />\nnumber of sketches were submitted.<br />\nThe competition was close. Walter<br />\nA. Wood, Jr., was elected art editor<br />\nand Frederick K. Bell was selected<br />\nas his assistant.

The shorter poems, particularly the quatrains and certain<br />\npassages in the longer poems,<br />\nwere considered by the speaker to<br />\nbe the best of Landor's work, although the. \"Imaginary Conversations\" and the critical articles were<br />\nfound to be distinctly worthy of consideration. Such biographical matters as account of Ihe poet's marriage, or of the throwing of a cook<br />\nfrom the window, proved highly<br />\namusing, and illustrated the fact<br />\nthat even when Landor was a very<br />\nold man he preserved almost too<br />\nmuch of the impetuosity and<br />\nthoughtlessness that are customarily<br />\nattributed to youth.<br />\nAt the close of the last lecture,<br />\nand on the motion of Dr. Bright, of<br />\nthe graduate English department, a<br />\nvote of thanks was tendered for the<br />\ngenerous provision that made possible the Turnbull lectures, and also<br />\nto Sir Walter Raleigh for delivering the course in 1915.
