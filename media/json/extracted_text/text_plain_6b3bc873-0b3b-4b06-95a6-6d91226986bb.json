The<br />\nCouncil's passage of meas.<br />\n4res for recall, referenda,<br />\nand discussions does represent a milestone, but the<br />\njourney which some claimed would lead to Utopia has<br />\nnot been completed.<br />\nCouncil power still stems from the Administration.<br />\nWhereas this plays no part in a preponderance of Council business, we must still expect showdowns where the<br />\nlast word will be spoken by the powers that be.But regardless of one's sentiments in this regard, there is<br />\nample cause for rejoicing in the change.<br />\nThe Council may be regarded in any one of three<br />\nways. It.is an organ for representing students before.the Administration; or conversely, its function is to<br />\nrepresent Administration before students; or finally,<br />\nit may assume the intermediate role of student-Administration go-between. Considered in the light of any<br />\nof these propositions, the Council's action was only to<br />\nbe expected. Its late date in coming forth\u2014years late<br />\n<br />\nWater<br />\nthe<br />\nbridge<br />\n<br />\n\u2014is its most striking feature.<br />\nCertainly, merely allowing a student to vote for a<br />\nman should carry with it the privilege of offering suggestions to him, and of expressing approval or disapproval of his actions. Regardless of what role a Councilman is supposed to play, his constituency may well<br />\nbe expected to be interested in how efficiently he plays<br />\nit.<br />\nWe ought to see some mighty interesting results. A<br />\nCouncilman's job, no matter whom he represents, is<br />\nan important one. Too often in the past have our<br />\npolitical hacks treated the office with little respect and<br />\nless concern. Adding to this the fact that only four<br />\nof the ten could even be worried about possible reelection, we have no trouble in understanding why responsible Councilmen have often been the exception<br />\nFather than the rule. The means for a check, at least,<br />\nis now furnished. \u2022<br />\nNow we're not foolishly idealistic enough to believe<br />\nthat we're in for a new era of conscientious representation. But its not too hard to understand how a Councilman might be forced into doing his job and doing<br />\nit to the best of his ability, if the mere threat of review<br />\nand explanation of his doings exists.<br />\nWell, we're mighty happy that all this has finally<br />\ncome to pass. We've watched a lot of water flow under the bridge since last fall, when the committee of<br />\nthirty harangued students on campus democracy, but<br />\nwe think it's all been for the best. The Council's<br />\nmain job still and always is to be a good Council, no<br />\nmatter what it's supposed to do.<br />\n<br />\nan autocracy of the South American variety still remains. The ultimate result will depend primarily upon<br />\nthe power of Britain's dour old man with the umbrella.<br />\nEvidently Chamberlain has at last awakened to the<br />\nthreat to his own shirt and democracy in general implicit in the insurgent triumph. Consequently, the days<br />\nsince the fall of Catalonia have seen the rise of a struggle to prevent Fascist and Nazi domination of Franco.<br />\nSupremely unconcerned when the Spanish war was<br />\nthe issue of freedom or slavery for the Spanish people,<br />\nChamberlain\u2014with the frightened Daladier at his back<br />\n\u2014now takes steps to prevent authoritarianism from<br />\nturning to fascism.<br />\nDisturbed by the thought of an Italian satellite<br />\nmenacing France and lying athwart the Rock of Gibraltar, the democracies are attempting to lure Franco into their camp. Although Mussolini has the advantage<br />\nof having supported the insurgents from the first with<br />\narmed forces, Chamberlain wields a powerful economic<br />\nweapon. As against Italy's promise of military aid,<br />\nChamberlain offers loans and favorable trade agreements. And Franco knows that Britain's financial<br />\nstrength is not to be scoffed at.<br />\nThe impending Anglo-Russian trade-talks perhaps<br />\nhint of another attempt to balk the Rome-Berlin axis.<br />\nThese talks indicate the first warming of English sentiment toward Russia since pre-Munich times and cornat a moment when Chamberlain realizes that he<br />\ncannot appease the fascists forever, they are highly<br />\nsignificant. If England can induce the Soviet to cooperate in the enticement of Franco by economic means,<br />\nhe will have a strong case.<br />\nThe surrender of the Loyalist regime seems now a<br />\nmatter of days. But the ultimate allegiance of the new<br />\nSpanish government will not be,determined until all<br />\nthe great powers of Europe have done their utmost.<br />\nBy the time we go to press,<br />\nthe Barnstormers, with a<br />\nwell-padded personnel including fifteen newly elected<br />\nmen, will have held its nominations for officers. The time<br />\nseems ripe for us to offer up<br />\nour annual prayer to the new regime for show number<br />\ntwo.<br />\nIt looks from here like a case of now or never. From<br />\nall indications the club is financially well-fixed. \"She<br />\nLoves Me Not\" was acclaimed by those in charge as<br />\na complete sellout\u2014so if there was ever any money in<br />\nthe till, it must be there now. At any rate, the club is<br />\ncertainly not in the red, and it's well worth taking the<br />\ngamble.<br />\nLast year's group set a precedent by \"experimenting\" with three one-act plays in the spring. The venture proved extremely gratifying to all concerned.

The<br />\nCouncil's passage of meas.<br />\n4res for recall, referenda,<br />\nand discussions does represent a milestone, but the<br />\njourney which some claimed would lead to Utopia has<br />\nnot been completed.<br />\nCouncil power still stems from the Administration.<br />\nWhereas this plays no part in a preponderance of Council business, we must still expect showdowns where the<br />\nlast word will be spoken by the powers that be.But regardless of one's sentiments in this regard, there is<br />\nample cause for rejoicing in the change.<br />\nThe Council may be regarded in any one of three<br />\nways. It.is an organ for representing students before.the Administration; or conversely, its function is to<br />\nrepresent Administration before students; or finally,<br />\nit may assume the intermediate role of student-Administration go-between. Considered in the light of any<br />\nof these propositions, the Council's action was only to<br />\nbe expected. Its late date in coming forth\u2014years late<br /><br />\nWater<br />\nthe<br />\nbridge<br /><br />\n\u2014is its most striking feature.<br />\nCertainly, merely allowing a student to vote for a<br />\nman should carry with it the privilege of offering suggestions to him, and of expressing approval or disapproval of his actions. Regardless of what role a Councilman is supposed to play, his constituency may well<br />\nbe expected to be interested in how efficiently he plays<br />\nit.<br />\nWe ought to see some mighty interesting results. A<br />\nCouncilman's job, no matter whom he represents, is<br />\nan important one. Too often in the past have our<br />\npolitical hacks treated the office with little respect and<br />\nless concern. Adding to this the fact that only four<br />\nof the ten could even be worried about possible reelection, we have no trouble in understanding why responsible Councilmen have often been the exception<br />\nFather than the rule. The means for a check, at least,<br />\nis now furnished. \u2022<br />\nNow we're not foolishly idealistic enough to believe<br />\nthat we're in for a new era of conscientious representation. But its not too hard to understand how a Councilman might be forced into doing his job and doing<br />\nit to the best of his ability, if the mere threat of review<br />\nand explanation of his doings exists.<br />\nWell, we're mighty happy that all this has finally<br />\ncome to pass. We've watched a lot of water flow under the bridge since last fall, when the committee of<br />\nthirty harangued students on campus democracy, but<br />\nwe think it's all been for the best. The Council's<br />\nmain job still and always is to be a good Council, no<br />\nmatter what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />\nan autocracy of the South American variety still remains. The ultimate result will depend primarily upon<br />\nthe power of Britain's dour old man with the umbrella.<br />\nEvidently Chamberlain has at last awakened to the<br />\nthreat to his own shirt and democracy in general implicit in the insurgent triumph. Consequently, the days<br />\nsince the fall of Catalonia have seen the rise of a struggle to prevent Fascist and Nazi domination of Franco.<br />\nSupremely unconcerned when the Spanish war was<br />\nthe issue of freedom or slavery for the Spanish people,<br />\nChamberlain\u2014with the frightened Daladier at his back<br />\n\u2014now takes steps to prevent authoritarianism from<br />\nturning to fascism.<br />\nDisturbed by the thought of an Italian satellite<br />\nmenacing France and lying athwart the Rock of Gibraltar, the democracies are attempting to lure Franco into their camp. Although Mussolini has the advantage<br />\nof having supported the insurgents from the first with<br />\narmed forces, Chamberlain wields a powerful economic<br />\nweapon. As against Italy's promise of military aid,<br />\nChamberlain offers loans and favorable trade agreements. And Franco knows that Britain's financial<br />\nstrength is not to be scoffed at.<br />\nThe impending Anglo-Russian trade-talks perhaps<br />\nhint of another attempt to balk the Rome-Berlin axis.<br />\nThese talks indicate the first warming of English sentiment toward Russia since pre-Munich times and cornat a moment when Chamberlain realizes that he<br />\ncannot appease the fascists forever, they are highly<br />\nsignificant. If England can induce the Soviet to cooperate in the enticement of Franco by economic means,<br />\nhe will have a strong case.<br />\nThe surrender of the Loyalist regime seems now a<br />\nmatter of days. But the ultimate allegiance of the new<br />\nSpanish government will not be,determined until all<br />\nthe great powers of Europe have done their utmost.<br />\nBy the time we go to press,<br />\nthe Barnstormers, with a<br />\nwell-padded personnel including fifteen newly elected<br />\nmen, will have held its nominations for officers. The time<br />\nseems ripe for us to offer up<br />\nour annual prayer to the new regime for show number<br />\ntwo.<br />\nIt looks from here like a case of now or never. From<br />\nall indications the club is financially well-fixed. \"She<br />\nLoves Me Not\" was acclaimed by those in charge as<br />\na complete sellout\u2014so if there was ever any money in<br />\nthe till, it must be there now. At any rate, the club is<br />\ncertainly not in the red, and it's well worth taking the<br />\ngamble.<br />\nLast year's group set a precedent by \"experimenting\" with three one-act plays in the spring. The venture proved extremely gratifying to all concerned. An<br />\ninterested (or play-struck) student body kept the offering on the boards for one whole week of evenings<br />\nat the Playshop, and the second Barnstormer show became more than mere print on a perforated caution<br />\ncard stub.<br />\nThe precedent is well set. We fervently hope that<br />\nour thespians aren't going to degenerate to key jangling<br />\nagain. But if they must, let them at least do it on the<br />\nstage in lieu of a second show.<br />\nWell, you new officers, take one of two courses\u2014<br />\neither give us our second production or have the registrar remove that tantalizing \"Second Barnstormer<br />\nShow\" stub from our caution cards, for once and forever.<br /><br />\nStrange<br /><br />\ninterlude<br /><br />\nA season and a half of<br />\nopen<br />\nadmissions to Black<br />\nPenniless<br />\nand Blue athletic toruneys<br />\nwill be over tomorrow night<br />\nwhen the Jay quint meets<br />\nthe Johnnies at Annapolis.<br />\nRepeating our performance<br />\nof the last two years, the team has had a 50-50 season.<br />\nThe locker rooms over at the cage are already humming<br />\nwith lacrosse activity.
