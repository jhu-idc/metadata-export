In December, apparently as many as<br />\n150 students did graduate, which is costing Hopkins<br />\nabout $200,000.<br />\nDean Suskind went on to lament that these students<br />\nwere \"just grabbing credits from anywhere in order to<br />\ngraduate early.\" He labeled the education these<br />\nstudents got as \"diluted,\" because they had transfer,<br />\nsummer school or minimester credits. He also stated<br />\nthat his office was not making it more diffucult for a<br />\nstudent who needs,less than 12 credits to graduate, to<br />\nbecome a part time student. That statement is simply<br />\nnot true. While it used to be no more difficult than a<br />\nvisit to the Dean's office to receive part time status, it<br />\nis not impossible.<br />\nAnd for Suskind to threaten raising the degree<br />\nrequirements in order to shake more money out of<br />\nalready hard-pressed students implies that the criterion<br />\nfor granting a degree is not how much the student has<br />\nlearned, as represented by the number of credits he<br />\nhas, but by how much money he has paid the<br />\nUniversity. Maybe Hopkins should run a national<br />\nadvertising campaign \"BA degrees from prestige<br />\ninstitution\u2014$12,000. No questions asked.\"<br />\n<br />\nIn Conversation<br />\n<br />\nBlack Students<br />\n(In Conversation is intended to provide<br />\ndetailed coverage of University topics. In<br />\nthis interview Robert Paulus questions<br />\nRalph Moore, Executive Council member<br />\nof the Black Students' Union.)<br />\nNews-Letter Most Hopkins students<br />\nknow little about the Black Student<br />\nUnion. How many students are in the<br />\nBSU, and what are the major functions of<br />\nthe Union?<br />\nRalph Moore: All black students in the<br />\nUniversity are automatically admitted<br />\ninto the Union, but there are about sixty<br />\nactive members.<br />\nIt's an organization where black<br />\nstudents, who are most definitely a<br />\nminority in the school; can come together<br />\nfor a sense of solidarity to discuss<br />\nproblems unique to black students, to<br />\nmake ourselves and the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity aware of the problems unique<br />\nto black and oppressed peoples. It's a<br />\nsocial organization, too.<br />\nWhat are some of the social functions<br />\nof the BSU?<br />\nBesides the normal parties and<br />\ntvnes of ',atm.-21 a,tityit..c<br />\nbeing considered\u2014art shows, soul food<br />\n6.0,0 GE.<br />\n<br />\ndca\u2022<br />\n<br />\ndisplays, and there's talk of bringing the<br />\nAfrican Ballet to Hopkins. These are just<br />\nsome of the possibilities.<br />\nThere are certain activites that the BSU<br />\nsponsors each year, such as the Martin<br />\nLuther King Lectureship Series. Last year<br />\nthe speaker was Ron Dellums, California<br />\ncongressman and member of the Black<br />\nCongressional Caucus. This year Coretta<br />\nKing is the tentative speaker. The Black<br />\nStudent Union is also going to co-sponsor<br />\na speaker in conjunction with the<br />\nWomen's Center in March. That speaker<br />\nwill be Shirley Chisholm, Congresswoman<br />\nand 1972 presidential candidate.<br />\nThere is also a separate orientation<br />\n<br />\nprogram for black students. In addition<br />\nseveral black students work with the<br />\nadmissions office in trying to attract<br />\nblacks to Hopkins.<br />\nWhy do you think Hopkins has<br />\nattracted so few black students?<br />\nI think that the main reason is the<br />\nfinancial one. The school seems to go all<br />\nout in admissions to get black students to<br />\napply, but the financial aid offered seems<br />\nto be inadequate. And this is no<br />\nreflection on any individual within the<br />\nfinancial aid office. It's just that black<br />\nindividuals can't afford Hopkins.<br />\nOkay, then, if the financial situation<br />\nfor blacks was alleviated, more blacks<br />\nwould be here?<br />\nI'm sure more blacks would come here<br />\nif financial aid was increased. A lot of the<br />\nblack students who are accepted here end<br />\nup going to Ivy League type schools<br />\nsimply because those schools offer better<br />\nfinancial assistance.<br />\nEarlier you mentioned problems<br />\n\"unique to blacks at Hopkins.\" What are<br />\nsome of these problems?<br />\n/hi mipction<br />\n<br />\nWell, what are some problems that<br />\n<br />\nyou, as a black student, have encountered<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nIn certain cases, I don't think some<br />\nprofessors have been appreciative of<br />\nparticular cultural, political, and social<br />\nbackgrounds and beliefs.<br />\nSuch as?<br />\nThe notion of genocide against black<br />\npeople as a solution to the problems of<br />\nrace relations in America.<br />\nYou mean to say that certain people at<br />\nHopkins fail to recognize that this notion<br />\nof genocide is considered by many blacks<br />\nto be a real possibility even if it is<br />\nunconsciously being pursued by certain<br />\nwhites in power?<br />\n<br />\nThere are magazines and there are.<br />\n<br />\nWhether the genocide is conscious or<br />\nunconscious, the effect is still the same.<br />\nBut I have been told at Hopkins that to<br />\neven consider the question of genocide is<br />\na waste of time. My personal problem<br />\nwith that is that the same thing was said<br />\nin Germany just before Hitler's rise to<br />\npower.<br />\nOkay, but getting back to Hopkins,<br />\nwhat other problems exist for black<br />\nstudents besides the \"cultural gap\"<br />\nbetween the white faculty and<br />\nadministration and the black minority?<br />\nMany of the black students are<br />\ninterested and concerned about things<br />\nother than what goes on at the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. That is to say some of us are<br />\nconcerned about problems occurring in<br />\nthe black community right now, such as<br />\nthose of hunger, health, malnutrition,<br />\ninadequate housing, rampant drugs,<br />\nprisons, and just plain day-to-day survival.<br />\nBut Hopkins doesn't seem to afford time<br />\nfor black students to take an interest in<br />\nthese things and we, as black people first<br />\n\u2014 \u2014 nu, have u xarx eaa,<br />\nand JLLUGILJ 3cL<br />\n<br />\nBy MICHAEL SIEGEL<br />\nOne generation passeth away, and<br />\nanother generation cometh, but Sports<br />\nIllustrated's Pro Football Review abides<br />\nforever. Hidden away in a corner of the<br />\nmagazine rack, it remains, along with<br />\nmany other publications, unbought and<br />\nperhaps even unoticed.<br />\nUnfortunately, publications of the Pro<br />\nFootball Review ilk are all too prevalent<br />\nat the Hopkins Book Center. It seems as<br />\nif the proprieters of the bookstore<br />\nconsider the Homewood community to<br />\nbe a cross-section of America at large, an<br />\nundiscriminating cross-section.

Although no one<br />\nhas ever accused Hopkins of being a jock<br />\nfactory, the bookstore stocks their<br />\nmagazines as if the average student ate<br />\nthe barbells for breakfast. An informal<br />\ncensus reveals that the Book Center<br />\ncarries fifteen different athletics-oriented<br />\npublications at any given time. Most of<br />\nthese (All-Star Sports, Baseball/1 972, and<br />\nPro Basketball Guide 1973, and on and<br />\non) appear to be produced by the same<br />\npublisher.

The Book<br />\nCenter stocks about thirty copies of<br />\n<br />\npremise for publication (if one were<br />\nreally intellectual one would not bother<br />\nwith an already-digested version of his<br />\nknowledge), features a table of contents<br />\nthat would seemingly discourage 99<br />\npercent of the intellectual community of<br />\nthe United States. Does anyone in<br />\nAmerica, much less Homewood, care<br />\nabout \"The Uses of Immaturity\"?<br />\nThe Hopkins Book Center has an<br />\nobligation to the students who use their<br />\nfacilities.

President. I began<br />\nfollowing his career, and I started talking<br />\nto people out at my school about him.<br />\n\"Everyone thought that he was just<br />\nusing the Kennedy name, and hadn't<br />\ndone anything on his own and didn't have<br />\nmuch substance st all.<br />\n\"I had thought that, even as cursorily<br />\nas I had followed him up to then, I knew<br />\nthat fi\u00e8 was doing all kinds of things.. I<br />\nwondered why people weren't aware of<br />\nthis and I found that coverape of him<br />\n<br />\n\u2014revolv-ed around his being 'the last<br />\nKennedy,' the 'We-love-you-Ted' sttgf<br />\nand the 'glamorous playboy type' and the<br />\nissues were getting left out. So I wanted<br />\nto focus in on these, put them into one<br />\nformat.\"<br />\nThe speaker is James Spada, a resident<br />\nof Staten Island, New York and currently<br />\na junior at Richmond College, near his<br />\nhome.<br />\nA longtime Kennedy fan (\"I'm just a<br />\nKennedy admirer\u2014I like them all.\"), he<br />\nhas also been, since 1-ebruary 1969, the<br />\neditor and publisher of a magazine unique<br />\nin the record of American political figures<br />\nand journalistic coverage of them.<br />\n<br />\nThe magazine in question is EMK: The<br />\nEdward M. Kennedy Quarterly, and its<br />\nprimary (although not sole) topic is the<br />\nsenior Senator from Massachusetts.<br />\nOdd<br />\nWilliam Buckley, Jr.'s comment, upon<br />\nhearing of the publication's existence,<br />\nwas limited to one word: \"Odd.\" and so<br />\nit is, for there is nothing like it in print<br />\ntoday.<br />\nHow did the magazine begin?<br />\n\"I had followed John and Bobby<br />\ndegree\u2014not as much<br />\nKennedy to a certain<br />\nthen\u2014but I was<br />\nsince<br />\nTed<br />\nhave<br />\nI<br />\nas<br />\n_ _<br />\ninterested in what they were doing for<br />\nthe country.<br />\n<br />\n\"After Bobby's assassination, I took an<br />\ninterest in Ted to a greater extent than in<br />\nany other politician. When Ted<br />\nannounced for the Whip fight, I was very<br />\nexcited by the prospect, because all the<br />\ncommentators were saying this was his<br />\nfirst step toward the Presidency. I<br />\nthought he'd make a good President, and<br />\nI wanted to support him.\"<br />\nNineteen<br />\nSpada was 19 years old,<br />\ntime,<br />\nAt the<br />\nwith absolutely no publishing experience<br />\nbehind him. He began the magazine<br />\nentirely on his own, however, and has<br />\nnever received\u2014or asked for\u2014any<br />\nfinancial support from Senator Kennedy<br />\n<br />\nor any of his staff.<br />\n\"In the beginning people would always<br />\nask me, `Houw mud} is he paying you to<br />\ndo this?' That's absurd because if he<br />\nreally wanted it done, he would pay<br />\nsomebody professional and not hire a<br />\ncollege kid. I was a iittle too obscure!\"<br />\nAs its title implies, EMK is published<br />\nfour times yearly, by seasons. It costs<br />\n$.75 per issue, and the average length of<br />\nthe quarterly is 30 pages. The nine issues<br />\nto date have chronicled Senator<br />\nKennedy's activities both in text and<br />\nillustration.<br />\nCurrently, EMK operates with a staff<br />\nof eight, with editors living across the<br />\ncountry. Spada and his girlfriend (who<br />\nhelps him with collating and mailing) live<br />\nin New York State, while other staff<br />\nmembers reside in Washington, Maryland,<br />\nand Vermont. Baltimore has supplied<br />\nseveral contributors, including Richard<br />\nEigenbrode, a Hopkins senior. \"It's not<br />\nan obsequous magazine,\" he commented,<br />\n\"and I think very real attempts are made<br />\nto be a professional job.\"<br />\nOf Senator Kennedy Spada says: \"He's<br />\na very impressive man, very tall and<br />\nout-of-the-ordinary looking. He has that<br />\nextra `something'\u2014I suppose it really is<br />\ncharisma. He's an imposing figure.\"<br />\nWhat does the Senator think of EMK?<br />\n\"I think Kennedy reads the magazine,<br />\nbut he's never contacted me about it or<br />\nwritten a letter to the editor.\"<br />\nIn the summer of 1970, Spada left his<br />\nhome and went to Boston to work in the<br />\nSenator's re-election effort, but it wasn't<br />\nall work: \"I was with the Senator in a<br />\nparade in Charles Town where his<br />\nRepublican opponent, Josiah Spaulding,<br />\nalso appeared. The Senator would come<br />\nby and be wildly cheered, while'<br />\n<br />\nSpaulding got a few scattered handclaps,<br />\nbecause no one recognized him.<br />\nSpaulding was marching behind a group<br />\nof horses, and he had the normal<br />\nproblems of someone walking behind a<br />\ngroup of horses!\"<br />\nBut what kind of reactions does Spada<br />\nget on his unusual hobby?<br />\n\"My father encouraged me. My brother<br />\nthinks I'm crazy for spending the money<br />\non it that I do (a personal contribution of<br />\nabout $4000) but he's still interested. My<br />\ngirl friend is very excited about it and<br />\nimpressed.\"<br />\nWhat about letters from EMK readers'?<br />\nMosTi are friendly, he asserts, but not all.<br />\n\"I get a lot of racist stuff, especially<br />\nfrom Baltimore. Kennedy is often called a<br />\nnigger-lover. But then, so is George<br />\nWallace in some of these letters.\"<br />\nWhat is the future of the magazine,<br />\nnow in its third year?<br />\n\"We've slowly been getting into the<br />\narts more. I want to have more original<br />\npieces in it\u2014interviews with political<br />\nfigures and theater people, for instance.<br />\nThe problem with the magazine is that<br />\nit's far too much a one-man project. I'm<br />\ntrying to get other people involved with<br />\nit.

Affable in<br />\nmanner and educated in tone,<br />\nHofmeister hardly seems to fit<br />\nthe role that one would expect a<br />\nBaltimore City Harbor Master to<br />\nfill. He has brought a little class<br />\nto an office which one imagines<br />\nwould be filled by some<br />\nrough-hewn ex-stevedore.<br />\nHow did Hofmeister happen to<br />\nmake the transition from a<br />\nHistory B.A. to the Harbor<br />\nMaster's office? In answer, he<br />\nwill jokingly \"blame\" the<br />\nDepression. Jobs were scarce<br />\nduring the '30's, particularly for<br />\nhistory teachers, and when the<br />\nopportunity for any kind of a job<br />\n<br />\ncame by, one could not afford to<br />\nturn it down. Thus, when<br />\nHofmeister left City College in<br />\n1930, after teaching history for<br />\nfive years, he bounced around<br />\nfrom job to job before the<br />\nopportunity came for a steady<br />\ncareer.<br />\nFirst, he worked a short while<br />\nagain as a teacher with the<br />\nArmy-Navy Prep School; then he<br />\ntried the investment banking<br />\nbusiness, with J.A.W. Iglehart &<br />\nCo. It collapsed shortly<br />\nthereafter, so Hofmeister got<br />\nanother teaching job at<br />\nWoodbrock School, which was<br />\nrun by Dinty Moore, of beef stew<br />\nand Hopkins lacrosse fame.<br />\nWhen that also folded, he<br />\nmanaged to latch onto a position<br />\nwith the Bridge Division of the<br />\nDepartment of engineering of<br />\nBaltimore City, where he had<br />\nworked summers as an<br />\nundergraduate. A short while<br />\nafterwards, the position of<br />\nharbor master became open, so<br />\nHofmeister applied for, and got,<br />\nthe job in 1940. After 32 years<br />\non Pier,4 off Pratt Street, he does<br />\nnot regret his decision.<br />\nAlthough his occupation is<br />\n<br />\ninvolved mainly with revenue<br />\ncollection, Hofmeister still finds<br />\nopportunities to exercise his<br />\ninterst in things historical. Two<br />\nyears ago for instance, in his<br />\ncapacity as Superintendent for<br />\nthe Public Markets (appointed<br />\n1967), he successfully resisted a<br />\nproposal by the Mayor to tear<br />\ndown the old Fish Market, which<br />\nremains today as one of<br />\nBaltimore's most interesting, and<br />\nfunctional, historical sights.<br />\nIn addition, Mr. Hofmeister<br />\nhas been a member of the<br />\nMaryland Historical Society, the<br />\nSt. George's Society of<br />\nBaltimore, and the Board of<br />\nTrustees of the Peale Museum. As<br />\nan officer for the Star-Spangled<br />\nBanner Flag House Association,<br />\nhe was instrumental in the<br />\nauthentic restoration of the old<br />\nFlag house. On occasions, he is<br />\nalso asked to speak to local<br />\ngroups about local historical<br />\nsubjects.<br />\nLooking back on his college<br />\ndays, Hofmeister remembers that<br />\nhe had always tried to get a<br />\nwell-rounded education, a goal<br />\nwhich he still recommends to<br />\nstudents today. At Hopkins,<br />\n<br />\nhotmeister was the true student<br />\n<br />\nof liberal arts, taking courses<br />\nfrom a wide spectrum of subject<br />\nmatter. The most valuable asset<br />\nhe gained from college, he noted,<br />\nwas not so much the book<br />\nknowledge he learned but rather<br />\n<br />\nthe contacts and associations he<br />\nmade that proved of life-long<br />\nvalue in developing friendships<br />\nand opening career doors.<br />\nAmong some of the contacts<br />\nHofmeister made, were those in<br />\nsoccer and tennis, two sports iP<br />\n<br />\n\ffehruary 9,1973/news4etteripage1L<br />\n<br />\nHopkins riflemen am' to improve<br />\nmark by increasing their ranks<br />\n.will be invited back next year.\"<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nTeam captain, Grif Lewis, is<br />\nThe Hopkins rifle team<br />\namassed an enviable record thus among the consistent high<br />\nfar this year.

The<br />\nthree most notable freshmen are<br />\nBob Stoever, Bob Schwenkler,<br />\nand Steve Keeble.<br />\nStoever went to the<br />\nAlberquerque Academy in New<br />\nMexico where he received<br />\nAll-American honors. There he<br />\nalso led his state in the breast<br />\nstroke, the individual medley and<br />\nthe 400 yard free style. He<br />\nselected Hopkins mainly because<br />\nof its academic reputation as well<br />\nas its up and coming swimming<br />\nteam, though size was also a<br />\nfactor.<br />\nStoever preferred Hopkins to a<br />\nlarger, big named, swimming<br />\nschool. As he commented to this<br />\nreporter, \"Here I con't have to<br />\nsacrifice my education for my<br />\nswimming. I think I could get<br />\nlost in a big school, and here I<br />\nhave a chance to perform more.\"<br />\n<br />\ndiversity a Me style<br />\nWhich he excelled. There was no<br />\nsoccer team at Hopkins then, but<br />\nthere was quite a large<br />\nmetropolitan league of 148 teams<br />\nduring the '20's and '30's, which<br />\nhad more teams than even the<br />\nCity of London had at the same<br />\ntime. Hofmeister played<br />\ncenter-half and fullback for two<br />\nsemi-pro teams at that time, the<br />\nFairlawn Rovers and Fernwood.<br />\nHe later coached an amateur<br />\nteam, the Maryland Collegians,<br />\nmade up of former players of his<br />\nfrom City College, who own the<br />\nentire State championship in<br />\n1932.<br />\nHofmeister was also a pretty<br />\nfair tennis player. He was captain<br />\nof the tennis team three years at<br />\nHopkins. After graduation, he<br />\nPlayed a lot at the Mt.<br />\nWashington Club, where he was<br />\nsingles champ for a good while.<br />\nHe also coached tennis at<br />\nHopkins. Carl Hartman, a<br />\nmember of the fine 1922 team<br />\nthat played the likes of Yale,<br />\nP.rinceton, and Penn, admired<br />\n!um very much, and said he<br />\nknew as much tennis as any<br />\nCoach Hopkins ever had.\"<br />\nHofmeister's greatest thrill in<br />\n<br />\nathletics came late in his sporting<br />\nlife, as a 38-year old entrant in<br />\nthe Baltimore singles<br />\ntournament. Out of a field of<br />\n102, he got down to the<br />\nsemi-finals, for his second match<br />\nof a long, hot afternoon. The<br />\nheat and his age finally got to<br />\nhim, and he lost two close sets to<br />\nthe eventual winner of the<br />\ntournament, Eddie Jacobs.<br />\nAntiques<br />\nToday, Hotmeister cannot be<br />\nso active athletically, so he<br />\nspends his spare time in another<br />\nhobby: collecting antiques. His<br />\nhome in Roland Park is known<br />\ncity-wide for being richly<br />\ndecorated with various antiques<br />\nthat Hofmeister has salveaged<br />\nfrom old buildings that have been<br />\ntorn down, or that he has<br />\npurchased cheap from junk<br />\nshops.<br />\nHe and his wife (with whom,<br />\nindicentally, he eloped on the eve<br />\nof their wedding day in 1929)<br />\nhave put as much time and energy<br />\ninto polishing and refinishing<br />\nitems they have collected, and<br />\nhave esthetically arranged them<br />\nthroughout several rooms in the<br />\nlarge house.<br />\n<br />\nThis year Bob earned a first<br />\nplace in the 200 yard breast<br />\nstroke against the University of<br />\nMaryland, with a time which<br />\nplaced him in the second position<br />\nin the College Division national<br />\nrankings in his event. About his<br />\nchances of improving his time,<br />\nStoever said, \"I've cut my time in<br />\nsome practices. It will all come<br />\ndown to the final meets.\"<br />\nGood Coach<br />\nStoever, a psychology major, is<br />\ngenerally happy with this<br />\nuniversity. He likes the<br />\npsychology<br />\ndepartment, but<br />\nstated that campus life was not<br />\nperfect, although time would<br />\nprobably clear up most of the<br />\nproblems.<br />\nWhen asked about toach<br />\nFrank Comfort, Stoever replied,<br />\n\"He's really a good coach.

In December, apparently as many as<br />\n150 students did graduate, which is costing Hopkins<br />\nabout $200,000.<br />\nDean Suskind went on to lament that these students<br />\nwere \"just grabbing credits from anywhere in order to<br />\ngraduate early.\" He labeled the education these<br />\nstudents got as \"diluted,\" because they had transfer,<br />\nsummer school or minimester credits. He also stated<br />\nthat his office was not making it more diffucult for a<br />\nstudent who needs,less than 12 credits to graduate, to<br />\nbecome a part time student. That statement is simply<br />\nnot true. While it used to be no more difficult than a<br />\nvisit to the Dean's office to receive part time status, it<br />\nis not impossible.<br />\nAnd for Suskind to threaten raising the degree<br />\nrequirements in order to shake more money out of<br />\nalready hard-pressed students implies that the criterion<br />\nfor granting a degree is not how much the student has<br />\nlearned, as represented by the number of credits he<br />\nhas, but by how much money he has paid the<br />\nUniversity. Maybe Hopkins should run a national<br />\nadvertising campaign \"BA degrees from prestige<br />\ninstitution\u2014$12,000. No questions asked.\"<br /><br />\nIn Conversation<br /><br />\nBlack Students<br />\n(In Conversation is intended to provide<br />\ndetailed coverage of University topics. In<br />\nthis interview Robert Paulus questions<br />\nRalph Moore, Executive Council member<br />\nof the Black Students' Union.)<br />\nNews-Letter Most Hopkins students<br />\nknow little about the Black Student<br />\nUnion. How many students are in the<br />\nBSU, and what are the major functions of<br />\nthe Union?<br />\nRalph Moore: All black students in the<br />\nUniversity are automatically admitted<br />\ninto the Union, but there are about sixty<br />\nactive members.<br />\nIt's an organization where black<br />\nstudents, who are most definitely a<br />\nminority in the school; can come together<br />\nfor a sense of solidarity to discuss<br />\nproblems unique to black students, to<br />\nmake ourselves and the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity aware of the problems unique<br />\nto black and oppressed peoples. It's a<br />\nsocial organization, too.<br />\nWhat are some of the social functions<br />\nof the BSU?<br />\nBesides the normal parties and<br />\ntvnes of ',atm.-21 a,tityit..c<br />\nbeing considered\u2014art shows, soul food<br />\n6.0,0 GE.<br /><br />\ndca\u2022<br /><br />\ndisplays, and there's talk of bringing the<br />\nAfrican Ballet to Hopkins. These are just<br />\nsome of the possibilities.<br />\nThere are certain activites that the BSU<br />\nsponsors each year, such as the Martin<br />\nLuther King Lectureship Series. Last year<br />\nthe speaker was Ron Dellums, California<br />\ncongressman and member of the Black<br />\nCongressional Caucus. This year Coretta<br />\nKing is the tentative speaker. The Black<br />\nStudent Union is also going to co-sponsor<br />\na speaker in conjunction with the<br />\nWomen's Center in March. That speaker<br />\nwill be Shirley Chisholm, Congresswoman<br />\nand 1972 presidential candidate.<br />\nThere is also a separate orientation<br /><br />\nprogram for black students. In addition<br />\nseveral black students work with the<br />\nadmissions office in trying to attract<br />\nblacks to Hopkins.<br />\nWhy do you think Hopkins has<br />\nattracted so few black students?<br />\nI think that the main reason is the<br />\nfinancial one. The school seems to go all<br />\nout in admissions to get black students to<br />\napply, but the financial aid offered seems<br />\nto be inadequate. And this is no<br />\nreflection on any individual within the<br />\nfinancial aid office. It's just that black<br />\nindividuals can't afford Hopkins.<br />\nOkay, then, if the financial situation<br />\nfor blacks was alleviated, more blacks<br />\nwould be here?<br />\nI'm sure more blacks would come here<br />\nif financial aid was increased. A lot of the<br />\nblack students who are accepted here end<br />\nup going to Ivy League type schools<br />\nsimply because those schools offer better<br />\nfinancial assistance.<br />\nEarlier you mentioned problems<br />\n\"unique to blacks at Hopkins.\" What are<br />\nsome of these problems?<br />\n/hi mipction<br /><br />\nWell, what are some problems that<br /><br />\nyou, as a black student, have encountered<br />\nat Hopkins?<br />\nIn certain cases, I don't think some<br />\nprofessors have been appreciative of<br />\nparticular cultural, political, and social<br />\nbackgrounds and beliefs.<br />\nSuch as?<br />\nThe notion of genocide against black<br />\npeople as a solution to the problems of<br />\nrace relations in America.<br />\nYou mean to say that certain people at<br />\nHopkins fail to recognize that this notion<br />\nof genocide is considered by many blacks<br />\nto be a real possibility even if it is<br />\nunconsciously being pursued by certain<br />\nwhites in power?<br /><br />\nThere are magazines and there are.<br /><br />\nWhether the genocide is conscious or<br />\nunconscious, the effect is still the same.<br />\nBut I have been told at Hopkins that to<br />\neven consider the question of genocide is<br />\na waste of time. My personal problem<br />\nwith that is that the same thing was said<br />\nin Germany just before Hitler's rise to<br />\npower.<br />\nOkay, but getting back to Hopkins,<br />\nwhat other problems exist for black<br />\nstudents besides the \"cultural gap\"<br />\nbetween the white faculty and<br />\nadministration and the black minority?<br />\nMany of the black students are<br />\ninterested and concerned about things<br />\nother than what goes on at the Hopkins<br />\ncampus. That is to say some of us are<br />\nconcerned about problems occurring in<br />\nthe black community right now, such as<br />\nthose of hunger, health, malnutrition,<br />\ninadequate housing, rampant drugs,<br />\nprisons, and just plain day-to-day survival.<br />\nBut Hopkins doesn't seem to afford time<br />\nfor black students to take an interest in<br />\nthese things and we, as black people first<br />\n\u2014 \u2014 nu, have u xarx eaa,<br />\nand JLLUGILJ 3cL<br /><br />\nBy MICHAEL SIEGEL<br />\nOne generation passeth away, and<br />\nanother generation cometh, but Sports<br />\nIllustrated's Pro Football Review abides<br />\nforever.

President. I began<br />\nfollowing his career, and I started talking<br />\nto people out at my school about him.<br />\n\"Everyone thought that he was just<br />\nusing the Kennedy name, and hadn't<br />\ndone anything on his own and didn't have<br />\nmuch substance st all.<br />\n\"I had thought that, even as cursorily<br />\nas I had followed him up to then, I knew<br />\nthat fi\u00e8 was doing all kinds of things.. I<br />\nwondered why people weren't aware of<br />\nthis and I found that coverape of him<br /><br />\n\u2014revolv-ed around his being 'the last<br />\nKennedy,' the 'We-love-you-Ted' sttgf<br />\nand the 'glamorous playboy type' and the<br />\nissues were getting left out. So I wanted<br />\nto focus in on these, put them into one<br />\nformat.\"<br />\nThe speaker is James Spada, a resident<br />\nof Staten Island, New York and currently<br />\na junior at Richmond College, near his<br />\nhome.<br />\nA longtime Kennedy fan (\"I'm just a<br />\nKennedy admirer\u2014I like them all.\"), he<br />\nhas also been, since 1-ebruary 1969, the<br />\neditor and publisher of a magazine unique<br />\nin the record of American political figures<br />\nand journalistic coverage of them.<br /><br />\nThe magazine in question is EMK: The<br />\nEdward M. Kennedy Quarterly, and its<br />\nprimary (although not sole) topic is the<br />\nsenior Senator from Massachusetts.<br />\nOdd<br />\nWilliam Buckley, Jr.'s comment, upon<br />\nhearing of the publication's existence,<br />\nwas limited to one word: \"Odd.\" and so<br />\nit is, for there is nothing like it in print<br />\ntoday.<br />\nHow did the magazine begin?<br />\n\"I had followed John and Bobby<br />\ndegree\u2014not as much<br />\nKennedy to a certain<br />\nthen\u2014but I was<br />\nsince<br />\nTed<br />\nhave<br />\nI<br />\nas<br />\n_ _<br />\ninterested in what they were doing for<br />\nthe country.<br /><br />\n\"After Bobby's assassination, I took an<br />\ninterest in Ted to a greater extent than in<br />\nany other politician. When Ted<br />\nannounced for the Whip fight, I was very<br />\nexcited by the prospect, because all the<br />\ncommentators were saying this was his<br />\nfirst step toward the Presidency. I<br />\nthought he'd make a good President, and<br />\nI wanted to support him.\"<br />\nNineteen<br />\nSpada was 19 years old,<br />\ntime,<br />\nAt the<br />\nwith absolutely no publishing experience<br />\nbehind him. He began the magazine<br />\nentirely on his own, however, and has<br />\nnever received\u2014or asked for\u2014any<br />\nfinancial support from Senator Kennedy<br /><br />\nor any of his staff.<br />\n\"In the beginning people would always<br />\nask me, `Houw mud} is he paying you to<br />\ndo this?' That's absurd because if he<br />\nreally wanted it done, he would pay<br />\nsomebody professional and not hire a<br />\ncollege kid. I was a iittle too obscure!\"<br />\nAs its title implies, EMK is published<br />\nfour times yearly, by seasons. It costs<br />\n$.75 per issue, and the average length of<br />\nthe quarterly is 30 pages. The nine issues<br />\nto date have chronicled Senator<br />\nKennedy's activities both in text and<br />\nillustration.<br />\nCurrently, EMK operates with a staff<br />\nof eight, with editors living across the<br />\ncountry. Spada and his girlfriend (who<br />\nhelps him with collating and mailing) live<br />\nin New York State, while other staff<br />\nmembers reside in Washington, Maryland,<br />\nand Vermont. Baltimore has supplied<br />\nseveral contributors, including Richard<br />\nEigenbrode, a Hopkins senior. \"It's not<br />\nan obsequous magazine,\" he commented,<br />\n\"and I think very real attempts are made<br />\nto be a professional job.\"<br />\nOf Senator Kennedy Spada says: \"He's<br />\na very impressive man, very tall and<br />\nout-of-the-ordinary looking. He has that<br />\nextra `something'\u2014I suppose it really is<br />\ncharisma. He's an imposing figure.\"<br />\nWhat does the Senator think of EMK?<br />\n\"I think Kennedy reads the magazine,<br />\nbut he's never contacted me about it or<br />\nwritten a letter to the editor.\"<br />\nIn the summer of 1970, Spada left his<br />\nhome and went to Boston to work in the<br />\nSenator's re-election effort, but it wasn't<br />\nall work: \"I was with the Senator in a<br />\nparade in Charles Town where his<br />\nRepublican opponent, Josiah Spaulding,<br />\nalso appeared. The Senator would come<br />\nby and be wildly cheered, while'<br /><br />\nSpaulding got a few scattered handclaps,<br />\nbecause no one recognized him.<br />\nSpaulding was marching behind a group<br />\nof horses, and he had the normal<br />\nproblems of someone walking behind a<br />\ngroup of horses!\"<br />\nBut what kind of reactions does Spada<br />\nget on his unusual hobby?<br />\n\"My father encouraged me. My brother<br />\nthinks I'm crazy for spending the money<br />\non it that I do (a personal contribution of<br />\nabout $4000) but he's still interested. My<br />\ngirl friend is very excited about it and<br />\nimpressed.\"<br />\nWhat about letters from EMK readers'?<br />\nMosTi are friendly, he asserts, but not all.<br />\n\"I get a lot of racist stuff, especially<br />\nfrom Baltimore. Kennedy is often called a<br />\nnigger-lover. But then, so is George<br />\nWallace in some of these letters.\"<br />\nWhat is the future of the magazine,<br />\nnow in its third year?<br />\n\"We've slowly been getting into the<br />\narts more. I want to have more original<br />\npieces in it\u2014interviews with political<br />\nfigures and theater people, for instance.<br />\nThe problem with the magazine is that<br />\nit's far too much a one-man project. I'm<br />\ntrying to get other people involved with<br />\nit.

In a close<br />\nmatch, Western Maryland<br />\ntriumphed by a score of 22-15.<br />\nThe action was fast and<br />\nfurious from the start as Ron<br />\nPucillo was taken down seven<br />\nsecond into his bout. At the end<br />\nof this 118-pound match, Pucillo<br />\nhad been beaten, 15-9.<br />\nWrestling in the 126-pound<br />\nclass, Mike Privitera lost by a<br />\nscore of 24-5. Clark Kingery,<br />\nwrestling at 134, lost 10-9, with<br />\nthe deciding point being the one<br />\nawarded for riding time. AFter<br />\nthese three matches, Hopkins was<br />\ntrailing 10-0.<br />\nRob Fink narrowed the score<br />\nto 1 0-3 by demolishing his<br />\nopponent 10-1. But the Terrors<br />\nregained their ten point lead in<br /><br />\nthe next match, in which Greg<br />\nGoldman was beaten, 11-5.<br />\nHopkins then made its final<br />\nattempt to gain victory,<br />\ngeginning with freshman Dave'<br />\nMulock's tough comeback win by<br />\na score of 4-2. Co-Captain CraigStevens, wrestling with bruised<br />\nribs, completely dominated his<br />\nopponent and came away with a<br />\n13-4 win. Like Fink, Stevens just<br />\ndid miss scoring a superior<br />\ndecision.<br />\nWith three matches remaining,<br />\nthe score stood at 13-9.<br />\nHowever, Wayne Panullo was<br />\nbeaten 8-3 and co-captain Heil<br />\nHazard was pinned, moving the<br />\nmatch out or reach for the Blue<br />\nJays.<br />\nIn th.e. final match,<br />\nheavyweight Gary Murza pinned<br />\nhis opponent with8 29 second<br />\nremaining in the third period,<br />\nanother impressive win for the<br />\nfreshman from Westmont, N.J.<br /><br />\nBalto.'s harbor master<br /><br />\nJean Hofmeister, Johns Hopkins '25, has made<br />\nBy NILS BRUBAKER<br />\nSoccer and tennis star,<br />\nhistorian, high school teacher,<br />\ninvestment banker, engineer,<br />\ndairy farmer, antique collector.<br />\nAt one time or another, Jean<br />\nHofmeister, Johns Hopkins '25<br />\nand presently Harbor Master for<br />\nthe City of Baltimore, has<br />\nengaged in all of the above<br />\nvocations and avocations.<br />\nIn a world that today puts<br />\nsuch an emphasis on<br />\nspecialization, it is refreshing to<br />\nmeet a man who has made<br />\ndiversity a life style. Affable in<br />\nmanner and educated in tone,<br />\nHofmeister hardly seems to fit<br />\nthe role that one would expect a<br />\nBaltimore City Harbor Master to<br />\nfill. He has brought a little class<br />\nto an office which one imagines<br />\nwould be filled by some<br />\nrough-hewn ex-stevedore.<br />\nHow did Hofmeister happen to<br />\nmake the transition from a<br />\nHistory B.A. to the Harbor<br />\nMaster's office? In answer, he<br />\nwill jokingly \"blame\" the<br />\nDepression. Jobs were scarce<br />\nduring the '30's, particularly for<br />\nhistory teachers, and when the<br />\nopportunity for any kind of a job<br /><br />\ncame by, one could not afford to<br />\nturn it down. Thus, when<br />\nHofmeister left City College in<br />\n1930, after teaching history for<br />\nfive years, he bounced around<br />\nfrom job to job before the<br />\nopportunity came for a steady<br />\ncareer.<br />\nFirst, he worked a short while<br />\nagain as a teacher with the<br />\nArmy-Navy Prep School; then he<br />\ntried the investment banking<br />\nbusiness, with J.A.W. Iglehart &amp;<br />\nCo. It collapsed shortly<br />\nthereafter, so Hofmeister got<br />\nanother teaching job at<br />\nWoodbrock School, which was<br />\nrun by Dinty Moore, of beef stew<br />\nand Hopkins lacrosse fame.<br />\nWhen that also folded, he<br />\nmanaged to latch onto a position<br />\nwith the Bridge Division of the<br />\nDepartment of engineering of<br />\nBaltimore City, where he had<br />\nworked summers as an<br />\nundergraduate. A short while<br />\nafterwards, the position of<br />\nharbor master became open, so<br />\nHofmeister applied for, and got,<br />\nthe job in 1940. After 32 years<br />\non Pier,4 off Pratt Street, he does<br />\nnot regret his decision.<br />\nAlthough his occupation is<br /><br />\ninvolved mainly with revenue<br />\ncollection, Hofmeister still finds<br />\nopportunities to exercise his<br />\ninterst in things historical. Two<br />\nyears ago for instance, in his<br />\ncapacity as Superintendent for<br />\nthe Public Markets (appointed<br />\n1967), he successfully resisted a<br />\nproposal by the Mayor to tear<br />\ndown the old Fish Market, which<br />\nremains today as one of<br />\nBaltimore's most interesting, and<br />\nfunctional, historical sights.<br />\nIn addition, Mr. Hofmeister<br />\nhas been a member of the<br />\nMaryland Historical Society, the<br />\nSt. George's Society of<br />\nBaltimore, and the Board of<br />\nTrustees of the Peale Museum. As<br />\nan officer for the Star-Spangled<br />\nBanner Flag House Association,<br />\nhe was instrumental in the<br />\nauthentic restoration of the old<br />\nFlag house. On occasions, he is<br />\nalso asked to speak to local<br />\ngroups about local historical<br />\nsubjects.<br />\nLooking back on his college<br />\ndays, Hofmeister remembers that<br />\nhe had always tried to get a<br />\nwell-rounded education, a goal<br />\nwhich he still recommends to<br />\nstudents today. At Hopkins,<br /><br />\nhotmeister was the true student<br /><br />\nof liberal arts, taking courses<br />\nfrom a wide spectrum of subject<br />\nmatter. The most valuable asset<br />\nhe gained from college, he noted,<br />\nwas not so much the book<br />\nknowledge he learned but rather<br /><br />\nthe contacts and associations he<br />\nmade that proved of life-long<br />\nvalue in developing friendships<br />\nand opening career doors.<br />\nAmong some of the contacts<br />\nHofmeister made, were those in<br />\nsoccer and tennis, two sports iP<br /><br />\nfehruary 9,1973/news4etteripage1L<br /><br />\nHopkins riflemen am' to improve<br />\nmark by increasing their ranks<br />\n.will be invited back next year.\"<br />\nBy DAN MYERS<br />\nTeam captain, Grif Lewis, is<br />\nThe Hopkins rifle team<br />\namassed an enviable record thus among the consistent high<br />\nfar this year.

The<br />\nthree most notable freshmen are<br />\nBob Stoever, Bob Schwenkler,<br />\nand Steve Keeble.<br />\nStoever went to the<br />\nAlberquerque Academy in New<br />\nMexico where he received<br />\nAll-American honors. There he<br />\nalso led his state in the breast<br />\nstroke, the individual medley and<br />\nthe 400 yard free style. He<br />\nselected Hopkins mainly because<br />\nof its academic reputation as well<br />\nas its up and coming swimming<br />\nteam, though size was also a<br />\nfactor.<br />\nStoever preferred Hopkins to a<br />\nlarger, big named, swimming<br />\nschool. As he commented to this<br />\nreporter, \"Here I con't have to<br />\nsacrifice my education for my<br />\nswimming. I think I could get<br />\nlost in a big school, and here I<br />\nhave a chance to perform more.\"<br /><br />\ndiversity a Me style<br />\nWhich he excelled. There was no<br />\nsoccer team at Hopkins then, but<br />\nthere was quite a large<br />\nmetropolitan league of 148 teams<br />\nduring the '20's and '30's, which<br />\nhad more teams than even the<br />\nCity of London had at the same<br />\ntime. Hofmeister played<br />\ncenter-half and fullback for two<br />\nsemi-pro teams at that time, the<br />\nFairlawn Rovers and Fernwood.<br />\nHe later coached an amateur<br />\nteam, the Maryland Collegians,<br />\nmade up of former players of his<br />\nfrom City College, who own the<br />\nentire State championship in<br />\n1932.<br />\nHofmeister was also a pretty<br />\nfair tennis player. He was captain<br />\nof the tennis team three years at<br />\nHopkins. After graduation, he<br />\nPlayed a lot at the Mt.<br />\nWashington Club, where he was<br />\nsingles champ for a good while.<br />\nHe also coached tennis at<br />\nHopkins. Carl Hartman, a<br />\nmember of the fine 1922 team<br />\nthat played the likes of Yale,<br />\nP.rinceton, and Penn, admired<br />\n!um very much, and said he<br />\nknew as much tennis as any<br />\nCoach Hopkins ever had.\"<br />\nHofmeister's greatest thrill in<br /><br />\nathletics came late in his sporting<br />\nlife, as a 38-year old entrant in<br />\nthe Baltimore singles<br />\ntournament. Out of a field of<br />\n102, he got down to the<br />\nsemi-finals, for his second match<br />\nof a long, hot afternoon. The<br />\nheat and his age finally got to<br />\nhim, and he lost two close sets to<br />\nthe eventual winner of the<br />\ntournament, Eddie Jacobs.<br />\nAntiques<br />\nToday, Hotmeister cannot be<br />\nso active athletically, so he<br />\nspends his spare time in another<br />\nhobby: collecting antiques. His<br />\nhome in Roland Park is known<br />\ncity-wide for being richly<br />\ndecorated with various antiques<br />\nthat Hofmeister has salveaged<br />\nfrom old buildings that have been<br />\ntorn down, or that he has<br />\npurchased cheap from junk<br />\nshops.<br />\nHe and his wife (with whom,<br />\nindicentally, he eloped on the eve<br />\nof their wedding day in 1929)<br />\nhave put as much time and energy<br />\ninto polishing and refinishing<br />\nitems they have collected, and<br />\nhave esthetically arranged them<br />\nthroughout several rooms in the<br />\nlarge house.<br /><br />\nThis year Bob earned a first<br />\nplace in the 200 yard breast<br />\nstroke against the University of<br />\nMaryland, with a time which<br />\nplaced him in the second position<br />\nin the College Division national<br />\nrankings in his event. About his<br />\nchances of improving his time,<br />\nStoever said, \"I've cut my time in<br />\nsome practices. It will all come<br />\ndown to the final meets.\"<br />\nGood Coach<br />\nStoever, a psychology major, is<br />\ngenerally happy with this<br />\nuniversity. He likes the<br />\npsychology<br />\ndepartment, but<br />\nstated that campus life was not<br />\nperfect, although time would<br />\nprobably clear up most of the<br />\nproblems.<br />\nWhen asked about toach<br />\nFrank Comfort, Stoever replied,<br />\n\"He's really a good coach. He<br />\nknows his swimming.\"<br />\nThe other two big frosh<br />\nmermen are both products of the<br />\nPhiladelphia area. Bob<br />\nSchwenkler, an All-American at<br />\nUpper Dublin High and Steve<br /><br />\nNEWS-LOTTER<br /><br />\nKeeble, who attended<br />\nArchbishop Wood High School,<br />\nfinished second and third<br />\nrespectively in the 50-yard style<br />\nagainst Navy.
