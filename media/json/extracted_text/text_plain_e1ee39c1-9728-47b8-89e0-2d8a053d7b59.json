Fifty years<br />\nago, when Gillett acted in Secret<br />\nService, the grandiose utterings<br />\nof the pasteboard hero and saccharine heroine may have been<br />\nseriously considered, but today<br />\nthey are funny, and no possible<br />\ntreatment could make them otherwise.

Near the village of Wan-pao Chan in Manchuria some Korean laborers were<br />\nbrought in to cultivate a heretofore idle tract of land. Irrigation<br />\nincident to the project necessitated<br />\nthe construction of a dam. A flood<br />\nresulted and, the local government<br />\nbeing too weak to take any effective measures, the Chinese farmers<br />\nmarched on the Korean laborers<br />\nwith the shedding of some blood.<br />\nJapanese soldiers came in as a result of this action, and reprisals<br />\nin the form of some killings and<br />\nmassacres took place.<br />\nMurder of Officer Claimed<br />\nAlleged assassination of a Japanese army captain traveling<br />\nthrough Chinese territory was likewise discussed by the student. According to him there was a lack of<br />\nevidence as to whether the deed<br />\nwas the result of an organized<br />\nChinese plot, or merely the work of<br />\na hot-headed Chinese.<br />\nThe crucial act was the attack<br />\non the Japanese controlled railroad<br />\nby a group of alleged Chines<'<br />\nsoldiers.

This continued the firm unvarying practice of England until<br />\nthe outbreak of the World War<br />\nin 1914. During this long period<br />\nfrom 1821 to 1914 the rest of the<br />\ncivilized world, iniluenced largely<br />\nby England's example, swung successively into the gold line. Currency systems based on inconvertible paper, on silver, on gold and<br />\nsilver joined in a bimetallic ratio,<br />\nwere reconstructed until at the<br />\nclose of the period the whole civilized world, with a few unimportant exceptions, was transacting its<br />\ndomestic exchanges and discharging its international balances with<br />\nthe aid of a gold measure of value.<br />\n\"With the outbreak of the World<br />\nWar the gold standard was promptly abandoned by all countries and<br />\nan era of inconvertible paper introduced. Gold was impounded and<br />\nhoarded, and government printing<br />\npresses were used to fill the gap.<br />\nThe result was over-issue, inflation,<br />\nand depreciation to a considerable<br />\nextent during hostilities, but to a<br />\nmuch grosser degree after the<br />\nArmistice. This decade may fairly<br />\nbe described as the dark age of<br />\ncurrency history.<br />\nEngland Courageous<br />\n\"In 1925 England led the van, as<br />\na century before, in the restoration<br />\nof the gold standard.

As the curtain des~ends, two pages approach from<br />\neither wing with the announcement that there is to be dancing<br />\nat the Knights of Phythias. This<br />\nis evidently not a part of the play,<br />\nbut might perhaps have been included in the childish plots and<br />\ncounter plots that run through<br />\nthe entire play.<br />\nTechnique Criticized<br />\nIn treating a play of this type<br />\nthere was only one technique open<br />\nto the Barnstormer's . . . extravagant burlesque. Fifty years<br />\nago, when Gillett acted in Secret<br />\nService, the grandiose utterings<br />\nof the pasteboard hero and saccharine heroine may have been<br />\nseriously considered, but today<br />\nthey are funny, and no possible<br />\ntreatment could make them otherwise. A serious rendition was<br />\nimpossible, and should not have<br />\nbeen attempted.<br />\nMiss Emily Bolgiano and Miss<br />\nJeannette Sauters, owing partly<br />\nto the character of their roles,<br />\nand partly to the quality of their<br />\ninterpretation, by far stole the<br />\nspotlight from the male element<br />\nof the cast. Even the underwear<br />\n(or whatever you call 'erri that<br />\nthe girls wore around their ankles<br />\nin those days) did not detract<br />\nfrom their grace and ease of performance. \u00b7whiting Farinholt and<br />\nTalbot Banks, as the hero and<br />\nvillain respectively, did fine pieces<br />\nof interpretative work, vvhich<br />\nwere rendered less evident only<br />\nby the obsolete character of the<br />\nplay. The comedy element suppJied by Charles Squire and<br />\nJeanette Sauter's southern accent<br />\nwere exceedingly well done. Miss<br />\nEvelyn Bigley also gave a creditable rendition as Mrs. Varney.<br />\nL. Bert Nye, was not, in spite of<br />\nthe opinion of a colleague, a bad<br />\nold Negro man at all.

It was stipulated that<br />\nthe Chinese should build no rail~oads paralell to those of the Japanese. Such railroads have been<br />\nbuilt; but, the speaker claimed, with<br />\nassistance from Japanese capital.<br />\nSeveral immediate events of<br />\nviolence were the immediate cause<br />\nof the present issue. Near the village of Wan-pao Chan in Manchuria some Korean laborers were<br />\nbrought in to cultivate a heretofore idle tract of land. Irrigation<br />\nincident to the project necessitated<br />\nthe construction of a dam. A flood<br />\nresulted and, the local government<br />\nbeing too weak to take any effective measures, the Chinese farmers<br />\nmarched on the Korean laborers<br />\nwith the shedding of some blood.<br />\nJapanese soldiers came in as a result of this action, and reprisals<br />\nin the form of some killings and<br />\nmassacres took place.<br />\nMurder of Officer Claimed<br />\nAlleged assassination of a Japanese army captain traveling<br />\nthrough Chinese territory was likewise discussed by the student. According to him there was a lack of<br />\nevidence as to whether the deed<br />\nwas the result of an organized<br />\nChinese plot, or merely the work of<br />\na hot-headed Chinese.<br />\nThe crucial act was the attack<br />\non the Japanese controlled railroad<br />\nby a group of alleged Chines&lt;'<br />\nsoldiers. The. Chinese War Office<br />\ndenied knowledge of such a move<br />\nhaving been ordered. In twentyfour hours the Japanese had occupied all of the most important 1fan1<br />\nchurian cities.<br />\nA squadron of Japanese fighting<br />\nplanes later bombed the city of<br />\nChing Chow-an act which aroused<br />\nthe other nations of the world.<br />\nStimson Censured<br />\nIntervention of the United States<br />\nwas termed as highly proper by<br />\nthe speaker. He deplored the lack<br />\nof more determined interventionter!l\\ing the communications of<br />\nSecretary . of State Stimson with<br />\nthe Japanese government as \"note3<br />\nwith high sounding words.\" The<br />\nJapanese resented this interference.<br />\nUpon orders by the League of<br />\nN1ations that the Japanese withdraw, they refused to do so unless<br />\nallowed the privilege of keeping<br />\n;\\fanchurian peace. The necessity<br />\nof United States intervention was<br />\nstressed by Mr. Yin as this country<br />\nis the depository of both the Kellog<br />\nPeace Pact and the Nine Powe1<br />\nTreaty.<br />\nMr. Pao-yu Yin was born in the<br />\ncity of Shanghai.
