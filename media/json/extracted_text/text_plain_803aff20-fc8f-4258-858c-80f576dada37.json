On the whole, I have not come to any deep seated conviction as to<br />\nWhether the boarding house was or was not above reproach. Perhaps in this<br />\ncase the young man was justified in giving an evasive answer; perhaps it was<br />\nas good a boarding house as he could afford and he did not wish to confess even<br />\nto himself that it was not all that he could desire; perhaps he thought it was<br />\nnone of the other fellow's business. But it seems to me that there is altogether<br />\ntoo much of this being non committal; we are too fond of silencing ourselves<br />\nand others with \"Well, it is not so had as it might be!\" We take matters too<br />\neasily and put up with things which we all agree to be, to say the least, unsatwe<br />\nisfactory, and we do this because we are indifferent or because we are afraid<br />\nour<br />\ndly<br />\nUndoubte<br />\nways.<br />\nmay make enemies or do ourselves harm in other<br />\nneglect of duty comes principally from these two sources, indifference, and the<br />\nfear of consequences. These two sins are far more common with older than<br />\nwith younger men. With the older ones they have become habits, and bad<br />\nhabits are the most deadening things on earth; the things to be most carefully<br />\nguarded against by young men.<br />\nDuring college days is given, to those who have the great privilege of going<br />\nto college, the opportunity of cultivating, under the most favorable conditions,<br />\ntheir enthusiasm, and of overcoming their cowardice. They are not ridiculed<br />\nfor their earnestness, and do not have any serious consequences to fear if they<br />\nCome out frankly with what they believe. Let them be enthusiastic and outspoken, for, while it is quite true that they are not yet ready to guide the affairs<br />\nof the nation, they are acquiring the power and forming traits of character which<br />\n<br />\nT<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nwill make them so.<br />\nThe value of the experience of college life is by no means restricted to the<br />\nknowledge of facts and that far more important thing, the training of the mind,<br />\nWhich makes it strong and fits it to undertake the problems which are sure to<br />\ncome up for solution. There is another element, which we all recognize, but<br />\nWhich is so near that we often overlook it; and this is the formation of character. In after life the struggle for supremacy, even for comfortable existence,<br />\nis so keen that even the best of men are in danger of being warped away from<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ntheir inmost convictions. It is hard for men to see that what seems to be<br />\nagainst their interests, especially when it brings up the question of comfort for<br />\ntheir wives and children, may he right and ought to receive their support.<br />\nDuring college life, questions of the same kind, but of less serious import, are<br />\nconstantly arising; but there a man is not subjected to the same temptations as<br />\nwhen the happiness and welfare of all that is nearest and dearest to him seems<br />\nto be involved. It is easier for him to do what his conscience tells him is right;<br />\nhe gets into the habit of looking upon questions without reference to .himself;<br />\nhe sees the right and learns to choose it regardless of consequences, because the<br />\nconsequences are comparatively unimportant. And when he has learned to do<br />\nthis in matters pertaining to his life in college, he naturally and easily continues<br />\nthe same method in the larger questions which confront him when he gets older<br />\nand goes out into the real world. Unfortunate, indeed, is he who neglects to<br />\ntake advantage of this part of his college education. The young man who in<br />\ncollege descends to unworthy methods or who even looks with tolerance upon<br />\nanything which is unworthy\u2014one who will say, as I have heard it said in<br />\nregard to some \"dirty work\" in a football game\u2014\"0, its all right so long as<br />\nthe referee doesn't see it,\" or will tolerate a trainer who teaches tricks, just<br />\nbecause he is a good trainer; or who will resort to unfair means to get in or<br />\nkeep out of some society any man, that young man is not only throwing away<br />\na most important part of his education, but is abusing the years of his college<br />\nlife to form a character which will make him distrusted, not only by his betters,<br />\nhut also by others of his own kind. My own personal experience when in college, and the experience which has come from being thrown into close contact<br />\nwith college men and boys getting ready for college, teaches me that boys, and,<br />\nlater, college men, are the most enthusiastically upright and honest men of the<br />\nworld. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement. There are, of<br />\ncourse, hundreds and thousands more honest men in the world who are not college men than of those who are. But what I mean is, that one of the great<br />\nadvantages of college education is that it, from its very character, teaches<br />\nuprightness, and that a man who has had this training is likely to be far better<br />\nin a truly moral way than he, individually, would have been without it.<br />\nJust as an athlete, who has had the benefit of proper training, is a far better<br />\nathlete than he would have been without it. So is the man better for the training which he gets from his teachers and from the association with his college<br />\nmates.<br />\nOne thinks first, when speaking of college education, of the actual learning<br />\nand mental training there; nowadays, of the benefit which comes from physical<br />\ntraining and the participation in honest healthful sports. But, to my mind,<br />\nthe training in strict honesty, in real manliness, is second to none of these.<br />\nLet, then, all college men do with more thought what the mass of them have<br />\nbeen doing so well, more or less unconsciously, teach themselves and their<br />\nmates the value of unbounding honesty, of uncompromising adherence to principle and the abhorrence of all which tends towards even toleration of anything<br />\nnot absolutely worthy of a man and a gentleman.<br />\n\"Disco at sompor vioturus;<br />\nViva ut eras moriturus.\"<br />\n<br />\nW.

Doors opened a few inches on<br />\nboth sides of corridors, as though the occupants feared that they, too, would<br />\nbe murdered, and one man alone allowed his excitement to carry him into the<br />\nhall where be began a hurried explanation to the hotel proprietor who appeared<br />\nat that moment. \"Yes, yes, right there at the end of the corridor! I heard a<br />\nloud commotion, evidently a drunken brawl, and then the pistol shot followed<br />\nby a cry of '0, my God!' Murder has been done. Summon the police at<br />\nonce!\"<br />\nit<br />\n\"Let us investigate first,\" hurridly exclaimed the proprietor; \"you say<br />\ncame from the end of the hall?\"<br />\n\"Yes, yes, I saw a white arm appear from the doorway, and then heard the<br />\nreport of the pist01,\u2014and here's where the bullet went through the floor,\" he<br />\ncried, running ahead and pointing to a torn place in the carpet.<br />\nAll this time the members of the Johns Hopkins lacrosse team, occupying<br />\nseven rooms along the corridor were stuffing blankets down their throats to<br />\nkeep from roaring at the practical joke which they knew ''Ab\" and \"Sid\" had<br />\nus try<br />\nPerpetrated upon the innocent proprietor and guests of the hotel. \"Let<br />\nof the<br />\nthat<br />\nopposite<br />\ndoor<br />\nhere,\" said the proprietor, rapping fiercely on the<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\n\"Why<br />\nB.\"<br />\n\"Billy<br />\nand<br />\nmiscreants which contained \"Ping Ponger P.\"<br />\nfellows,\"<br />\nbed,<br />\nto<br />\ngo<br />\n\"Yes,<br />\nh-1 don't you fellows go to bed,\" sang out Billy.<br />\nsaid P\u2014,\"we have a hard game to-morrow.\" \"Open up, open up!\" cried the<br />\ndoor<br />\nProprietor. \"What on earth's the trouble?' inquired Billy opening the<br />\nthe<br />\ndemanded<br />\nknow,\"<br />\nWith an innocent look. \"That's what I want to<br />\nproprietor.<br />\n\"Well, inquire on the other side,\" said Billy closing the door. \"I heard<br />\nsome noise over there.\"<br />\n\"Ab,\" upon hearing the hotel proprietor bang on his door: \"Get the h-1<br />\navvay from there,\u2014you just woke me up, and I won't stand for much more!\"<br />\nI either!\" called out ''Sid.\"<br />\nBoth positively refused admittance, and the proprietor departed, only to<br />\nreturn shortly with a police.<br />\n\"Mr. Officer,\" he said upon persuading Billy to open up again, \"I want<br />\nYou to search this room for concealed weapons.\" P\u2014: \"If he does without a<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nwritten search warrant, I'll sue you for if\" Little \"Bernie,\" Tough and<br />\n\"Aber,\" appearing in night robes: \"That's right, boys, make him get a search<br />\nwarrant.\"<br />\n\"That's a fact,\" broke in the police, taking a cigarette from his mouth,<br />\n\"we've got to have a search warrant.\"<br />\nAt this the proprietor nearly had a fit which did not prove a benefit, and<br />\nthey departed for the warrant.<br />\nAt this interesting point \"Bill\" Schmeisser rushed in, mad all over and<br />\nmade every man go to bed. He proceeded forthwith to go down and explain<br />\nall to the proprietor and there ended part of the howling good time which<br />\npassed during the visit of the lacrosse team to South Bethlehem, Pa.<br />\nOn the following morning the following article appeared among the \"Police Notes\" of \"The Globe:\"<br />\nMYSTERIOUS PISTOL SHOT.<br />\n<br />\nExcitement was caused last night, between 10 and 11 o'clock, by the report of firearms<br />\nin the corridor of a popular hotel in South Bethlehem. The order of events was as follows:<br />\nCommotion and loud talking; a pistol report; an exclamation, \"0 my God!\" silence;<br />\nappearance of hotel proprietor and police. The fracas was traced to a stranger who is here<br />\nfor some sports today. No arrest was made. Why?

This game is the first appearance of the team in Baltimore, and<br />\noffers also the first chance for Hopkins students to show a little material<br />\nappreciation of the ball-tossers, who both deserve and need a large amount of<br />\nsuch appreciation. For, in spite of its discouragements, obstacles, and reverses,<br />\nthe baseball team of 1902 is a matter of pride to its members, its friends, and the<br />\nUniversity. Its policy has been from the first to make dates with the best colleges available; it has stuck to this policy; and, above all, its officers and individual members have worked consistently and faithfully to develop the<br />\nmaterial at hand. But fortune has turned her face. The Princeton game, which<br />\nwas expected to put the management on a sound financial basis, fell on a rainy<br />\nday, and caused a heavy loss to the individual players, since the Athletic Association has delayed the recognition of the team in consideration of the sins of<br />\nsome of its predecessors. At the Maryland Agricultural College game, described on another page, the boys were out for a victory. The score was: M.<br />\nA. C., 3; Hopkins, 2. Although it is the policy of the NEWS-L-ETTER to stand<br />\naloof from athletic disagreements, we cannot ignore the complaints from many<br />\nsources that the Hopkins players were not treated with the courtesy which<br />\nshould be extended by home men to a visiting team. On the other hand, the<br />\nposition of Hopkins was within the definition of true sport. The Black and<br />\nBlue doesn't \"quit,\"\u2014even under the provocation of a sorely trying game.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nThe baseball team has played, it has played in hard luck, and it is not<br />\nWhining. Such conduct is called \"sportsmanship.\" Let us hope that every<br />\nlover of college sport in the University will recognize this fact, and will present<br />\nhimself this afternoon to cheer on the J. H. U. in an uphill game. Furthermore, there is a chance to see an exhibition of playing by Georgetown, perhaps<br />\nthe strongest college team in America. Let not a man be missing when the<br />\numpire calls \"Play ball!\"<br />\nHERE are two classes of students who never write for the NEWS-LETTER<br />\n\u2014those who are afraid their efforts will not be accepted, and those who<br />\nare afraid that they will.

The worker on a \"scrub\" team has little hope of appearing as an athletic hero; but his work does not go for nothing; he derives much personal<br />\nbenefit from the exercise, and he may finally succeed in getting a place.

HOPKINS, 2.<br />\nHE game of April 26th, at College Park, which went on record as a victory<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nfor Maryland Agricultural College by a score of 3 to 2, was unsatisfactory<br />\nto both teams. That there were so many disputed points seemed to be<br />\ngenerally regretted. In the eighth inning, M. A. C. claimed to have scored a<br />\nman from third base before the third hand was put out by McKnight at second,<br />\nwho caught Mathews' fly and then came in to make an unassisted double play<br />\nby touching Smith while off his base. The run was not allowed by the umpire.<br />\nCampbell, first up for Hopkins in the ninth, singled to right field. Hand<br />\nfollowed with a beautiful three-bagger down the line back of first base, which<br />\nwas called foul after Campbell had run home and Hand himself reached third.<br />\nThe hit was unquestionably good, except in the judgment of the umpire. Hand<br />\ntried over again and made a good single to right which put Campbell on third.<br />\nFrom there he scored the tieing run (score 2 to 2) on Ogle's neat sacrifice, but<br />\non the play Hand, who had stolen second, was put out trying to reach home.<br />\nHad Hand's original hit been allowed more runs would have resulted and the<br />\nend perhaps been changed.<br />\nM. A. C. went to bat and succeeded in getting men on second and third<br />\nwith two hands out. The base lines were crowded by a mob of yelling students.<br />\nThe coacher by third base made a \"fake\" run to the plate, which, because of<br />\nthe disorder and confusion, drew a quick throw from Whipple. The ball went<br />\na little high and rolled some ten feet back of Campbell, who recovered it<br />\nSpeedily, but meantime the true base runner had come in with the so-called<br />\nwinning run. Thus, not by an honest manly effort, but by a very questionable<br />\n<br />\n\f12<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nstrategem, the game was secured by M. A. C. No such trick would have been<br />\npossible if the spectators had been kept within proper bounds.<br />\nApart from these points of dispute, the contest was clean and fast. Both<br />\npitchers did good work. Although Whipple allowed seven hits, these were well<br />\nscattered and perfect support would have brought him an easy shut-out. Hopkins' errors were not glaring and ghastly, but just little slips that marred an<br />\notherwise excellent game. The team as a whole played with great credit, and<br />\nshowed vast improvement over previous performances. Moore was again a<br />\nconspicuous factor in the game. The small score was chiefly due to the failure<br />\nto hit pitcher Brown, who had very little speed, but, what served better, admirable control. For M. A. C. Captain Nichols at shortstop played the star game.<br />\nThe men lined up as follows:<br />\nMoore, s. s., Marine, c. f., McKnight, 1. f., Campbell, c., Hand, 2b., Ogle,<br />\n3b., Wright, r. f. Constantine, lb., Whipple, p.<br />\nDuring the past week the team has been out for batting and fielding<br />\npractice, and promises to play a consistently good game against Georgetown<br />\ntoday. No prediction is made as to the score, but Hopkins is expected to do all<br />\nthat it is capable of. Great disappointment was manifested when early in the<br />\nseason rain fell upon the day set for the game with Princeton. Manager Lazenby<br />\nhas sought to make amends by bringing over the great famous nine from the<br />\ngreat Georgetown University. The contest is expected to attract interest not<br />\nonly at Hopkins, but also throughout the city. Georgetown is perhaps the<br />\nstrongest college team in America.<br />\nOn saturday next, May 10th, Hopkins will go to Westminster to play the<br />\nlast game of the season with Western Maryland College. As this is also the<br />\nday of the lacrosse game with Swarthmore, the contest in Westminster will<br />\nlikely be played in the morning so that the base ball team may return to<br />\nBaltimore by afternoon. This arrangement will also permit any rooters who<br />\ndesire it to witness both games.<br />\nThe base ball team has experienced many set-backs during the season;<br />\nfirst, in having trouble to organize, and, then, in the prevalence of wet weather<br />\nand difficulty in securing practice grounds. Through it all the team has been<br />\nself- supporting, the men giving freely their time, money, and enthusiasm. The<br />\nresults of their sacrifice will be more apparent after the game with Western<br />\nMaryland It is hoped, however, that their record and efforts will deserve<br />\nrecognition by the Athletic Board.<br />\nHOPKINS 9, LEHIGH 1.<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\nHE victory of our lacrosse team over Lehigh in the first of the championship games, on April 26, only adds stronger proof to the fact that our<br />\nprospects are exceptionally bright for another pennant on the walls of<br />\nthe trophy room. Lehigh played at home, and the team which Hopkins<br />\ndowned was one that could not possibly have been defeated by Hobart as it was<br />\nseveral weeks ago. Hopkins found them well trained, fairly well acquainted<br />\nwith team play, and rough antagonists throughout.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nHopkins started off at a rapid pace, and when five, then ten, minutes passed<br />\nWithout scoring, it looked as though the game would be very close. Apparently<br />\nHopkins was using this time in sizing up her opponents, for after twelve minutes' play the first goal was scored, and the six which followed before the end<br />\nof the half seemed to come with comparative ease. With a score of 7 to 0 to<br />\nour credit, Captain Schmeisser very wisely decided that it would be of no particular advantage to pile up a humiliating score in the second half. The players did not lie down by any means, but the aggressive play of the latter part of<br />\nthe first half was not continued, and our defense was given abundant opportunities to demonstrate body checking, covering back, intercepting passes, and<br />\nnumerous other \"stunts,\" all of which they executed with the utmost dexterity.<br />\nCaptain Schmeisser (lid not think of being excited over so much defense work,<br />\nand, with the able assistance of \"Chick\" and Henry Straus, managed to break<br />\nup all sorts of grand-stand plays which emanated from Captain Lattig's fertile<br />\nbrain. Blanck and 'rough managed to make themselves as ubiquitous as newspaper men, and when the ball got through the entire defense, it generally took<br />\na sudden halt before Briscoe's keen eye. He made several remarkably clever<br />\nstops, and Lehigh would not have scored at all had he not been a little overconfident of stopping the very shot which managed to get through.<br />\nWith the exception of a little work now and then, the attack stood around<br />\nduring this time and enjoyed the fun. When Lehigh scored about the middle<br />\nof the half, a slight restlessness was observed, and the result was a goal for<br />\nHopkins within a minute. This, with one which was made at the beginning<br />\nof the half, brought the score up to 9 to 1 goals.<br />\nHopkins lined up as follows: Putts, in home; B. Bernheim, out home;<br />\nSayler, first attack; Bird, second attack; P. Bernheim, third attack; Abercrombie, center; Tough, third defense; Blanck, second defense; H. Straus, first<br />\ndefense; E. Schmeisser, cover point; W. Schmeisser,(Captain) point; Briscoe,<br />\ngoal.<br />\nTwo thirty minute halves were played, and the men seemed to stand the<br />\ntime extremely well. The team appears to be very well balanced, and with<br />\nhard, snappy work next Saturday afternoon, the championship should be ours.<br />\nEvery man out to cheer the men to victory!<br />\n<br />\n03' WINS AGAIN.<br />\nHE event in which we Hopkins men were most interested in at the Boys'<br />\nLatin School\u2014Deichman's Dual meet, held last Friday at Electric Park,<br />\nwas the invitation relay race run by the freshman and junior classes.<br />\nThis was the last chance this year that freshman had to get some of the glory<br />\nthey had lost in former contests with the upper classinen and they put forth<br />\ntheir best material in this race.

On the whole, I have not come to any deep seated conviction as to<br />\nWhether the boarding house was or was not above reproach. Perhaps in this<br />\ncase the young man was justified in giving an evasive answer; perhaps it was<br />\nas good a boarding house as he could afford and he did not wish to confess even<br />\nto himself that it was not all that he could desire; perhaps he thought it was<br />\nnone of the other fellow's business. But it seems to me that there is altogether<br />\ntoo much of this being non committal; we are too fond of silencing ourselves<br />\nand others with \"Well, it is not so had as it might be!\" We take matters too<br />\neasily and put up with things which we all agree to be, to say the least, unsatwe<br />\nisfactory, and we do this because we are indifferent or because we are afraid<br />\nour<br />\ndly<br />\nUndoubte<br />\nways.<br />\nmay make enemies or do ourselves harm in other<br />\nneglect of duty comes principally from these two sources, indifference, and the<br />\nfear of consequences. These two sins are far more common with older than<br />\nwith younger men. With the older ones they have become habits, and bad<br />\nhabits are the most deadening things on earth; the things to be most carefully<br />\nguarded against by young men.<br />\nDuring college days is given, to those who have the great privilege of going<br />\nto college, the opportunity of cultivating, under the most favorable conditions,<br />\ntheir enthusiasm, and of overcoming their cowardice. They are not ridiculed<br />\nfor their earnestness, and do not have any serious consequences to fear if they<br />\nCome out frankly with what they believe. Let them be enthusiastic and outspoken, for, while it is quite true that they are not yet ready to guide the affairs<br />\nof the nation, they are acquiring the power and forming traits of character which<br /><br />\nT<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\nwill make them so.<br />\nThe value of the experience of college life is by no means restricted to the<br />\nknowledge of facts and that far more important thing, the training of the mind,<br />\nWhich makes it strong and fits it to undertake the problems which are sure to<br />\ncome up for solution. There is another element, which we all recognize, but<br />\nWhich is so near that we often overlook it; and this is the formation of character. In after life the struggle for supremacy, even for comfortable existence,<br />\nis so keen that even the best of men are in danger of being warped away from<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\ntheir inmost convictions. It is hard for men to see that what seems to be<br />\nagainst their interests, especially when it brings up the question of comfort for<br />\ntheir wives and children, may he right and ought to receive their support.<br />\nDuring college life, questions of the same kind, but of less serious import, are<br />\nconstantly arising; but there a man is not subjected to the same temptations as<br />\nwhen the happiness and welfare of all that is nearest and dearest to him seems<br />\nto be involved. It is easier for him to do what his conscience tells him is right;<br />\nhe gets into the habit of looking upon questions without reference to .himself;<br />\nhe sees the right and learns to choose it regardless of consequences, because the<br />\nconsequences are comparatively unimportant. And when he has learned to do<br />\nthis in matters pertaining to his life in college, he naturally and easily continues<br />\nthe same method in the larger questions which confront him when he gets older<br />\nand goes out into the real world. Unfortunate, indeed, is he who neglects to<br />\ntake advantage of this part of his college education. The young man who in<br />\ncollege descends to unworthy methods or who even looks with tolerance upon<br />\nanything which is unworthy\u2014one who will say, as I have heard it said in<br />\nregard to some \"dirty work\" in a football game\u2014\"0, its all right so long as<br />\nthe referee doesn't see it,\" or will tolerate a trainer who teaches tricks, just<br />\nbecause he is a good trainer; or who will resort to unfair means to get in or<br />\nkeep out of some society any man, that young man is not only throwing away<br />\na most important part of his education, but is abusing the years of his college<br />\nlife to form a character which will make him distrusted, not only by his betters,<br />\nhut also by others of his own kind. My own personal experience when in college, and the experience which has come from being thrown into close contact<br />\nwith college men and boys getting ready for college, teaches me that boys, and,<br />\nlater, college men, are the most enthusiastically upright and honest men of the<br />\nworld. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement. There are, of<br />\ncourse, hundreds and thousands more honest men in the world who are not college men than of those who are. But what I mean is, that one of the great<br />\nadvantages of college education is that it, from its very character, teaches<br />\nuprightness, and that a man who has had this training is likely to be far better<br />\nin a truly moral way than he, individually, would have been without it.<br />\nJust as an athlete, who has had the benefit of proper training, is a far better<br />\nathlete than he would have been without it. So is the man better for the training which he gets from his teachers and from the association with his college<br />\nmates.<br />\nOne thinks first, when speaking of college education, of the actual learning<br />\nand mental training there; nowadays, of the benefit which comes from physical<br />\ntraining and the participation in honest healthful sports. But, to my mind,<br />\nthe training in strict honesty, in real manliness, is second to none of these.<br />\nLet, then, all college men do with more thought what the mass of them have<br />\nbeen doing so well, more or less unconsciously, teach themselves and their<br />\nmates the value of unbounding honesty, of uncompromising adherence to principle and the abhorrence of all which tends towards even toleration of anything<br />\nnot absolutely worthy of a man and a gentleman.<br />\n\"Disco at sompor vioturus;<br />\nViva ut eras moriturus.\"<br /><br />\nW.

Don't point that in my face!\"<br />\nDoor opens,--report of pistol.<br />\nFirst voice\u2014'`O, my God! I'm shot!\" Silence.<br />\nSuch were the appalling cries which struck terror to the hearts of the<br />\nguests on the third floor of Hotel Wyandotte. Doors opened a few inches on<br />\nboth sides of corridors, as though the occupants feared that they, too, would<br />\nbe murdered, and one man alone allowed his excitement to carry him into the<br />\nhall where be began a hurried explanation to the hotel proprietor who appeared<br />\nat that moment. \"Yes, yes, right there at the end of the corridor! I heard a<br />\nloud commotion, evidently a drunken brawl, and then the pistol shot followed<br />\nby a cry of '0, my God!' Murder has been done. Summon the police at<br />\nonce!\"<br />\nit<br />\n\"Let us investigate first,\" hurridly exclaimed the proprietor; \"you say<br />\ncame from the end of the hall?\"<br />\n\"Yes, yes, I saw a white arm appear from the doorway, and then heard the<br />\nreport of the pist01,\u2014and here's where the bullet went through the floor,\" he<br />\ncried, running ahead and pointing to a torn place in the carpet.<br />\nAll this time the members of the Johns Hopkins lacrosse team, occupying<br />\nseven rooms along the corridor were stuffing blankets down their throats to<br />\nkeep from roaring at the practical joke which they knew ''Ab\" and \"Sid\" had<br />\nus try<br />\nPerpetrated upon the innocent proprietor and guests of the hotel. \"Let<br />\nof the<br />\nthat<br />\nopposite<br />\ndoor<br />\nhere,\" said the proprietor, rapping fiercely on the<br />\nin<br />\nthe<br />\n\"Why<br />\nB.\"<br />\n\"Billy<br />\nand<br />\nmiscreants which contained \"Ping Ponger P.\"<br />\nfellows,\"<br />\nbed,<br />\nto<br />\ngo<br />\n\"Yes,<br />\nh-1 don't you fellows go to bed,\" sang out Billy.<br />\nsaid P\u2014,\"we have a hard game to-morrow.\" \"Open up, open up!\" cried the<br />\ndoor<br />\nProprietor. \"What on earth's the trouble?' inquired Billy opening the<br />\nthe<br />\ndemanded<br />\nknow,\"<br />\nWith an innocent look. \"That's what I want to<br />\nproprietor.<br />\n\"Well, inquire on the other side,\" said Billy closing the door. \"I heard<br />\nsome noise over there.\"<br />\n\"Ab,\" upon hearing the hotel proprietor bang on his door: \"Get the h-1<br />\navvay from there,\u2014you just woke me up, and I won't stand for much more!\"<br />\nI either!\" called out ''Sid.\"<br />\nBoth positively refused admittance, and the proprietor departed, only to<br />\nreturn shortly with a police.<br />\n\"Mr. Officer,\" he said upon persuading Billy to open up again, \"I want<br />\nYou to search this room for concealed weapons.\" P\u2014: \"If he does without a<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nwritten search warrant, I'll sue you for if\" Little \"Bernie,\" Tough and<br />\n\"Aber,\" appearing in night robes: \"That's right, boys, make him get a search<br />\nwarrant.\"<br />\n\"That's a fact,\" broke in the police, taking a cigarette from his mouth,<br />\n\"we've got to have a search warrant.\"<br />\nAt this the proprietor nearly had a fit which did not prove a benefit, and<br />\nthey departed for the warrant.<br />\nAt this interesting point \"Bill\" Schmeisser rushed in, mad all over and<br />\nmade every man go to bed. He proceeded forthwith to go down and explain<br />\nall to the proprietor and there ended part of the howling good time which<br />\npassed during the visit of the lacrosse team to South Bethlehem, Pa.<br />\nOn the following morning the following article appeared among the \"Police Notes\" of \"The Globe:\"<br />\nMYSTERIOUS PISTOL SHOT.<br /><br />\nExcitement was caused last night, between 10 and 11 o'clock, by the report of firearms<br />\nin the corridor of a popular hotel in South Bethlehem.

The fracas was traced to a stranger who is here<br />\nfor some sports today. No arrest was made. Why?

This game is the first appearance of the team in Baltimore, and<br />\noffers also the first chance for Hopkins students to show a little material<br />\nappreciation of the ball-tossers, who both deserve and need a large amount of<br />\nsuch appreciation. For, in spite of its discouragements, obstacles, and reverses,<br />\nthe baseball team of 1902 is a matter of pride to its members, its friends, and the<br />\nUniversity. Its policy has been from the first to make dates with the best colleges available; it has stuck to this policy; and, above all, its officers and individual members have worked consistently and faithfully to develop the<br />\nmaterial at hand. But fortune has turned her face. The Princeton game, which<br />\nwas expected to put the management on a sound financial basis, fell on a rainy<br />\nday, and caused a heavy loss to the individual players, since the Athletic Association has delayed the recognition of the team in consideration of the sins of<br />\nsome of its predecessors. At the Maryland Agricultural College game, described on another page, the boys were out for a victory. The score was: M.<br />\nA. C., 3; Hopkins, 2. Although it is the policy of the NEWS-L-ETTER to stand<br />\naloof from athletic disagreements, we cannot ignore the complaints from many<br />\nsources that the Hopkins players were not treated with the courtesy which<br />\nshould be extended by home men to a visiting team. On the other hand, the<br />\nposition of Hopkins was within the definition of true sport. The Black and<br />\nBlue doesn't \"quit,\"\u2014even under the provocation of a sorely trying game.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nThe baseball team has played, it has played in hard luck, and it is not<br />\nWhining. Such conduct is called \"sportsmanship.\" Let us hope that every<br />\nlover of college sport in the University will recognize this fact, and will present<br />\nhimself this afternoon to cheer on the J. H. U. in an uphill game. Furthermore, there is a chance to see an exhibition of playing by Georgetown, perhaps<br />\nthe strongest college team in America. Let not a man be missing when the<br />\numpire calls \"Play ball!\"<br />\nHERE are two classes of students who never write for the NEWS-LETTER<br />\n\u2014those who are afraid their efforts will not be accepted, and those who<br />\nare afraid that they will. These latter non.contributors feel that modesty<br />\nand good sense forbid their adding to the world's already large stock of poor<br />\nwriting. Such a spirit, although commendable in some points, is tremendously<br />\nall unObstructive to the best interests of the paper. After all, the blame for<br />\nthough<br />\nworthy matter in these pages falls to the lot of the editors,\u2014unwilling<br />\nthey be; and it is only by a plentiful supply of \"copy\" in general, and of expressions of opinion on matters of interest, that the paper can be representative.<br />\nThis last applies likewise to the first class mentioned above\u2014those who<br />\ngrudge the chalice of losing time in productions foredoomed to oblivion and the<br />\nwaste-basket. Such lack of spirit has often been belabored by the lash of criticism in these columns, and with some effect. An athletic analogy is applicable. The worker on a \"scrub\" team has little hope of appearing as an athletic hero; but his work does not go for nothing; he derives much personal<br />\nbenefit from the exercise, and he may finally succeed in getting a place. So<br />\nwith the individual student and the paper : you may not get a place, but you<br />\nare improving in a useful practice, you will certainly strike on something<br />\nthe<br />\navailable now and then, and you will be helping towards the ideal that<br />\nHOPJOHNS<br />\nTHE<br />\nOF<br />\nTS<br />\nSTUDEN<br />\n\"THE<br />\nby<br />\nis<br />\npublished<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\nKINS UNIVERSITY.\"<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE ATHLETIC TEAMS sought laurels for the Black and Blue on the 26th<br />\nof last month. Only one\u2014the Lacrosse\u2014brought home the laurels; but<br />\nthey all could boast of clean sport and a good struggle.<br />\nThe lacrosse team keeps adding game after game to its long list of victories,<br />\nand indications seem to point to a season unmarred by a single defeat. The<br />\nsecret of success, aside from the traditions of the game which the players seem<br />\nbound to uphold, lies in the fact that each player, varsity and scrub, looks upon<br />\nhis work as a conscientious duty. Members of other teams could well afford to<br />\ntake lessons in this respect from the lacrosse men. Every day track team<br />\nmeet<br />\ncandidates are hard at work at Electric Park getting in trim for the large<br />\non the fourteenth of May. Hopkins stands an excellent chance to win a<br />\nmajority of the points, if the men will only come out and work. The Pennsylvania games have become athletic history, and Hopkins returns home with<br />\nmen<br />\nsecond place scored to her credit, resolved to do better next season.

The Board of Editors, no doubt, have sufficient confidence in themselves to undertake the writing of the whole book without assistance, but it is doubtful whether this would serve the best ends of the University.<br />\nFor the book is intended to be a reflection\u2014as bright as possible\u2014of college<br />\nlife at the J.

HOPKINS, 2.<br />\nHE game of April 26th, at College Park, which went on record as a victory<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nfor Maryland Agricultural College by a score of 3 to 2, was unsatisfactory<br />\nto both teams. That there were so many disputed points seemed to be<br />\ngenerally regretted. In the eighth inning, M. A. C. claimed to have scored a<br />\nman from third base before the third hand was put out by McKnight at second,<br />\nwho caught Mathews' fly and then came in to make an unassisted double play<br />\nby touching Smith while off his base. The run was not allowed by the umpire.<br />\nCampbell, first up for Hopkins in the ninth, singled to right field. Hand<br />\nfollowed with a beautiful three-bagger down the line back of first base, which<br />\nwas called foul after Campbell had run home and Hand himself reached third.<br />\nThe hit was unquestionably good, except in the judgment of the umpire. Hand<br />\ntried over again and made a good single to right which put Campbell on third.<br />\nFrom there he scored the tieing run (score 2 to 2) on Ogle's neat sacrifice, but<br />\non the play Hand, who had stolen second, was put out trying to reach home.<br />\nHad Hand's original hit been allowed more runs would have resulted and the<br />\nend perhaps been changed.<br />\nM. A. C. went to bat and succeeded in getting men on second and third<br />\nwith two hands out. The base lines were crowded by a mob of yelling students.<br />\nThe coacher by third base made a \"fake\" run to the plate, which, because of<br />\nthe disorder and confusion, drew a quick throw from Whipple. The ball went<br />\na little high and rolled some ten feet back of Campbell, who recovered it<br />\nSpeedily, but meantime the true base runner had come in with the so-called<br />\nwinning run. Thus, not by an honest manly effort, but by a very questionable<br /><br />\n12<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nstrategem, the game was secured by M. A. C. No such trick would have been<br />\npossible if the spectators had been kept within proper bounds.<br />\nApart from these points of dispute, the contest was clean and fast. Both<br />\npitchers did good work. Although Whipple allowed seven hits, these were well<br />\nscattered and perfect support would have brought him an easy shut-out. Hopkins' errors were not glaring and ghastly, but just little slips that marred an<br />\notherwise excellent game. The team as a whole played with great credit, and<br />\nshowed vast improvement over previous performances. Moore was again a<br />\nconspicuous factor in the game. The small score was chiefly due to the failure<br />\nto hit pitcher Brown, who had very little speed, but, what served better, admirable control. For M. A. C. Captain Nichols at shortstop played the star game.<br />\nThe men lined up as follows:<br />\nMoore, s. s., Marine, c. f., McKnight, 1. f., Campbell, c., Hand, 2b., Ogle,<br />\n3b., Wright, r. f. Constantine, lb., Whipple, p.<br />\nDuring the past week the team has been out for batting and fielding<br />\npractice, and promises to play a consistently good game against Georgetown<br />\ntoday. No prediction is made as to the score, but Hopkins is expected to do all<br />\nthat it is capable of. Great disappointment was manifested when early in the<br />\nseason rain fell upon the day set for the game with Princeton. Manager Lazenby<br />\nhas sought to make amends by bringing over the great famous nine from the<br />\ngreat Georgetown University. The contest is expected to attract interest not<br />\nonly at Hopkins, but also throughout the city. Georgetown is perhaps the<br />\nstrongest college team in America.<br />\nOn saturday next, May 10th, Hopkins will go to Westminster to play the<br />\nlast game of the season with Western Maryland College. As this is also the<br />\nday of the lacrosse game with Swarthmore, the contest in Westminster will<br />\nlikely be played in the morning so that the base ball team may return to<br />\nBaltimore by afternoon. This arrangement will also permit any rooters who<br />\ndesire it to witness both games.<br />\nThe base ball team has experienced many set-backs during the season;<br />\nfirst, in having trouble to organize, and, then, in the prevalence of wet weather<br />\nand difficulty in securing practice grounds. Through it all the team has been<br />\nself- supporting, the men giving freely their time, money, and enthusiasm. The<br />\nresults of their sacrifice will be more apparent after the game with Western<br />\nMaryland It is hoped, however, that their record and efforts will deserve<br />\nrecognition by the Athletic Board.<br />\nHOPKINS 9, LEHIGH 1.<br /><br />\nt<br /><br />\nHE victory of our lacrosse team over Lehigh in the first of the championship games, on April 26, only adds stronger proof to the fact that our<br />\nprospects are exceptionally bright for another pennant on the walls of<br />\nthe trophy room. Lehigh played at home, and the team which Hopkins<br />\ndowned was one that could not possibly have been defeated by Hobart as it was<br />\nseveral weeks ago. Hopkins found them well trained, fairly well acquainted<br />\nwith team play, and rough antagonists throughout.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nHopkins started off at a rapid pace, and when five, then ten, minutes passed<br />\nWithout scoring, it looked as though the game would be very close. Apparently<br />\nHopkins was using this time in sizing up her opponents, for after twelve minutes' play the first goal was scored, and the six which followed before the end<br />\nof the half seemed to come with comparative ease. With a score of 7 to 0 to<br />\nour credit, Captain Schmeisser very wisely decided that it would be of no particular advantage to pile up a humiliating score in the second half. The players did not lie down by any means, but the aggressive play of the latter part of<br />\nthe first half was not continued, and our defense was given abundant opportunities to demonstrate body checking, covering back, intercepting passes, and<br />\nnumerous other \"stunts,\" all of which they executed with the utmost dexterity.<br />\nCaptain Schmeisser (lid not think of being excited over so much defense work,<br />\nand, with the able assistance of \"Chick\" and Henry Straus, managed to break<br />\nup all sorts of grand-stand plays which emanated from Captain Lattig's fertile<br />\nbrain. Blanck and 'rough managed to make themselves as ubiquitous as newspaper men, and when the ball got through the entire defense, it generally took<br />\na sudden halt before Briscoe's keen eye. He made several remarkably clever<br />\nstops, and Lehigh would not have scored at all had he not been a little overconfident of stopping the very shot which managed to get through.<br />\nWith the exception of a little work now and then, the attack stood around<br />\nduring this time and enjoyed the fun. When Lehigh scored about the middle<br />\nof the half, a slight restlessness was observed, and the result was a goal for<br />\nHopkins within a minute. This, with one which was made at the beginning<br />\nof the half, brought the score up to 9 to 1 goals.<br />\nHopkins lined up as follows: Putts, in home; B. Bernheim, out home;<br />\nSayler, first attack; Bird, second attack; P. Bernheim, third attack; Abercrombie, center; Tough, third defense; Blanck, second defense; H. Straus, first<br />\ndefense; E. Schmeisser, cover point; W. Schmeisser,(Captain) point; Briscoe,<br />\ngoal.<br />\nTwo thirty minute halves were played, and the men seemed to stand the<br />\ntime extremely well. The team appears to be very well balanced, and with<br />\nhard, snappy work next Saturday afternoon, the championship should be ours.<br />\nEvery man out to cheer the men to victory!<br /><br />\n03' WINS AGAIN.<br />\nHE event in which we Hopkins men were most interested in at the Boys'<br />\nLatin School\u2014Deichman's Dual meet, held last Friday at Electric Park,<br />\nwas the invitation relay race run by the freshman and junior classes.<br />\nThis was the last chance this year that freshman had to get some of the glory<br />\nthey had lost in former contests with the upper classinen and they put forth<br />\ntheir best material in this race.
