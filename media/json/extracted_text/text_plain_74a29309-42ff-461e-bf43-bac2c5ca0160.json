Allen,<br />\nEnglish, is in the midst of his last<br />\nundergraduate class,<br />\nShakespeare. Next semester he<br />\nwill continue with a graduate<br />\nseminar but otherwise will no<br />\nlonger teach in class.<br />\nMr. Allen is already three<br />\nYears over retirement age, but<br />\n\u2022 has still sparkled wittily in<br />\nEnglish classes here. His special<br />\nfield . is .16th and 17th century<br />\nlite:r.ature and his favorite<br />\ncourses have been Shakespeare<br />\nand Milton.<br />\nWizardly Gentleman<br />\nHearing Dr. Allen in a<br />\nShakespeare class is to hear a<br />\nperky stream of detatched and<br />\nhumorous insights. With it all<br />\n<br />\ncomes an intuitive sense of the<br />\nplays: their characters, spirit and<br />\nlooming behind the lectern, the<br />\nwizardly white-haired old<br />\ngentleman who larkishly keeps<br />\npeople chuckling.<br />\nIt all began back at the<br />\nUniversity of Illinois where Dr.<br />\nAllen started his sophomore year<br />\nin 1932 with the intention of<br />\nmajoring in Bacteriology, a sort<br />\nof ancient form of modern<br />\nbiology. He enrolled in an<br />\nEnglish class devised for science<br />\nmajors, and thanks to the<br />\nteacher, Bruce Weirick, he soon<br />\nfound himself majoring in<br />\nEnglish literature. \"If it hadn't<br />\nbeen for Mr. Weirick,\" Allen<br />\nsays, \"I'd probably be working<br />\nas a chemist in some cheese<br />\nfactory now.\"<br />\n<br />\nCo-eds Unable to Get<br />\nContraceptives Here<br />\n<br />\nAt Illinois, Don Allen was also<br />\neditor-in -chief of the Daily<br />\nIllinois. \"Those were the<br />\nsporting page days,\" he says.<br />\n\"There was little interest in<br />\npolitics, economics or the<br />\nin tellectual world. Everything<br />\nwas simple minded compared to<br />\nnow. Kids had an eagerness for<br />\nsecurity and a good safe job.\"<br />\nBeer was King<br />\nThat's changed now and Dr.<br />\nAllen is happy. \"Students don't<br />\naccept things blindly as they<br />\nused to, and that's how progress<br />\nis made. Leading thinkers always<br />\nstart by doubting what is being<br />\nsaid.\"<br />\n. Campus life at ,Illinois was<br />\npretty different too. \"Girls had<br />\nto be in at 10:00 and publishing<br />\nsatire on Urbana could get you<br />\nin hot water in nothing flat. Beer<br />\nwas the end; the modern<br />\nundergrad doesn't realize what<br />\nthose days were like.\"<br />\nAt Hopkins, Don Allen has<br />\nbeen very happy. He particularly<br />\nenjoys the academic freedom of<br />\nreading and saying what he<br />\npleases in class.<br />\nBefore coming to Hopkins in<br />\n1941, Allen had taught at Purd-<br />\n<br />\nD. C'. Allen<br />\nue, Washington State, Illinois,<br />\nWeslyan, Colorado,<br />\nNorthwestern and Duke. \"This is<br />\nthe freest school I've been at,\"<br />\nhe says, \"The administration has<br />\nnever interfered in any way with<br />\nmy work. At other places a rich<br />\ntrustee or alumni would call me<br />\nup and wonder why their kid<br />\nwasn't a brilliant English<br />\nstudent. Then they'd pressure<br />\nthe administration. Nothing like<br />\nthat, has ever happened here.<br />\nProfessors have been<br />\ntraditionally judged on one<br />\n<br />\nthing, their performance.\"<br />\nAllen also appreciates students<br />\nat Hopkins and is<br />\nrelieved that education here has<br />\noutgrown the system of<br />\n\"returning vomit to the dog\"<br />\nthat characterized many of his<br />\nearlier teaching jobs.<br />\nHe remembers his early years<br />\nat Hopkins when there were just<br />\nfour people in the English<br />\ndepartment, three in History and<br />\nfour in Romance languages.<br />\n\"Nine people came to a baseball<br />\ngame once,\" he said, referring to<br />\nthe Hopkins team. \"There were<br />\njust six buildings. Merganthaler<br />\nwas just finished and the library<br />\nwas in Gilman.\"<br />\nAllen considers the Hopkins<br />\nEnglish department as one of the<br />\nbest in the country. \"With our<br />\neight or nine people, the<br />\nnational appraisal still puts us<br />\neighth in the country. That's<br />\nhigher than any other<br />\ndepartment here at Hopkins,<br />\nexcept maybe Biology.\"<br />\nD. C. Allen can't think of<br />\nanother school in the U.S. that<br />\nhe would have been happier at<br />\nthan Hopkins. \"I even wish I'd<br />\nbeen an undergraduate here.\"<br />\n<br />\nLow Prices at Hopkins Club<br />\n<br />\nRoy W.

The ruling<br />\nsaid that students could not be excluded from voting because they are temporary residents, thus making them eligible to vote in their college communities. Coupled with<br />\nthe Constitutional amendment and state law providing for<br />\nan 18-year-old vote, this decision enables us at once to<br />\nplay a significant role in area politics, as well as to avoid<br />\nthe difficulties of absentee voting in our home states. Now<br />\nthe prime obstacle to participation is only our own apathy.<br />\nHere at Hopkins we should resist what seems to be a national trend of low registration, and make our presence felt<br />\nin the upcoming Presidential election year. And in future<br />\nyears, students will be able to do more than just lick envelopes in the campaigns of Congressmen, Senators, Assemblymen and City Councilmen.<br />\nIn some communities, like Berkeley, young voters have<br />\nbeen able to radicalize city government, and the same prospect seems likely in the youth-dominated community of<br />\nCollege Park, Maryland. In the Baltimore area, of course,<br />\nsuch a political enclave is improbable, but the student vote<br />\nwill, hopefully, force most city candidates to demonstrate<br />\nThe immediate opportunity,<br />\ngreater social concern.<br />\nthough, is the primary in May,and in this state at least we<br />\ndon't have to stand idly by as figures such as Henry Jackson or Edmund Muskie make their bids for victory.<br />\n<br />\nCampus meetings<br />\nThose two venerable Hopkins bodies politic, the faculty General Assembly and the Student Council met this<br />\nweek with the General Assembly looking like an efficient,<br />\nintelligent group of men compared to our top student governing body. We wish this decision were a surprise, but it's<br />\nbeginning to become a sure thing. The SC spent mr)st of its<br />\nmeeting berating the News-Letter for inacuracies and mistakes which they failed to specify. We will gladly correct<br />\nany errors we have made, but so far, none have been pointed out, only vaguely hinted at. Other than that, the Council did nothing.<br />\nThe General Assembly was energetic and full of life in<br />\ncomparison, appointing no less than two new committees,<br />\nwith a slight chance that these new groups might benefit<br />\nstudents. It is about time that the professors 'got involved<br />\nin the admissions procedure, and a committee was formed<br />\nto work with that office in changing Hopkins' image.<br />\nHopefully this will do more than give sterile advice, actually getting out and talking to potential matriculates in attempting to balance out the spread of majors. But if this<br />\ncommittee is successful, and Dr. Eisenhower's predicted<br />\ninflux of new students occurs, we hope the General Assembly will see fit to appoint another to get a few more course<br />\nofferings.<br />\nIn their other action, the Assembly struck a blow for<br />\nteaching by appointing a committee to review promotions<br />\nand appointments with teaching in mind. It is not clear<br />\nhow this body will differ from the Academic Council in its<br />\nactions, but seemingly it cannot hurt.<br />\n<br />\nSept. 28,1971<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br />\n<br />\nDecision Maker<br />\n<br />\nTOUCHE,ZORRO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLast year there was hope that<br />\nthe Newsletter was finally<br />\ngrowing up, cleaning the New<br />\nLeft muck off its rear end, and<br />\nbecoming -- if not completely<br />\nopen and unbiased -- at least a<br />\nshade less one-sided, but it seems<br />\nthis feeling was premature.

We feel this<br />\nway about Attica. What really happened? Who<br />\nkilled whom?<br />\no ordered what when? 'RR our<br />\npast experience must surely tell us that it is folly<br />\nto wait. Reports and commissions after an event<br />\nusually confirm first impressions or turn out to<br />\nbe so ambiguous that they can be used as proof<br />\nfor anything. And in the process of waiting for<br />\nall the evidence, we lose the most important weapon we possess--the ability to react quickly and<br />\neffectively to events as they happen. So it is essential that we react to Attica now, using all the<br />\ninformation that we have at our command. There<br />\nare two sources of information---the reports on<br />\nthe event and the social, economic and political<br />\ncontext which makes such an event possible and<br />\ncredible to us as part of the dynamic of the society in which we live.<br />\nEconomically, we are in crisis. A high unemployment rate is associated with too few resources to go around and a rapid inflation. This economic crisis must be brought under control and,<br />\nin the process, somebody somewhere must suffer. The present social, economic and institutional structure dictates that it cannot be capitalist<br />\nenterprise.<br />\nThe brunt of the economic burden must thus fall elsewhere. The primary attack<br />\nis upon welfare and government spending in socially relavant areas. A second attack is upon,<br />\nwage earners.<br />\nThere is also evidence<br />\nthat government agencies are moving to adopt<br />\npolicies that involve the withdrawal of support<br />\nfor large parts of the inner city .<br />\nWho are prisoners and where do they come<br />\nfron't4. where are about a half million prisoners<br />\nnow in jail and most come from the ranks of the<br />\npoor and the inner cities. The groups and areas<br />\nfrom which prisoners come are now about to be<br />\nsqueezed even harder. Even the Eisenhower Commission on Violence recognized the social and<br />\neconomic origins of much \"criminal\" activity.<br />\nWhat else can people do when they are unemployed, when welfare payments are totally inadequate, when social services are reduced even further in the name of efficiency and budgetary solvency TN results must surely bring an increase<br />\nin the prison population which is already experiencing one of its biggest booms in history. To be<br />\nin prison is like being on the worst kind of wel- \u2022<br />\nfare society can offer---57 cents a day for food<br />\nsomebody told me. In prison we find the most<br />\ndegraded form of human life. It is at the prison<br />\ngates that the last hint of liberal reformism ends<br />\nand genuine fascist society---a microcosm of it to<br />\nbe sure---begins. Brutality, rascism, sadism degradation here reign supreme, all in the name of<br />\ncorrection, rather than in their true guise---as vengence upon those whose condition is a continuous reproach to the whole of society Prisoners<br />\nhave learned from bitter experience that society<br />\nDr. David Harvey is an Associate Professor in<br />\nthe Department of Geography<br />\n<br />\nwon't or can't listen unless prisoners draw attention to their plight by forceful action. In the<br />\nprocess, prisoners become politicized and take<br />\npolitical action. They are then branded as \"militants\" or, as Commissioner Oswald called them<br />\nin Attica, \"Maoists.\"<br />\nWhat of the of4cial response at Attici? We<br />\nknow that Roctcefeller ordered the use of force,<br />\nthat he consulted with the President's office beforehand and was commended by the President<br />\nimmediately afterwards. It was obvious that killing would result. However, the unashamed use of<br />\nfire power is new. Killings have occurred before,<br />\nof course, but never with the full weight of authority in favor of such a violent response. Why<br />\nnow so overt? .Because the threat posed by the<br />\nsoners is substantially greater than that of, say,<br />\nrioting students at Kent State. The political<br />\nalignments and divisions generated through racism and economic distrust also encourage elected officials to respond violently in order to reap<br />\npolitical support to get re-elected as \"decisive\"<br />\nheros---hence the unseemly haste with which<br />\nRockefeller proudly assumed responsibility for<br />\nAttica.The current economic squeeze on the poor<br />\nand the withdrawal of support from the inner<br />\ncity can all too easily lead to desperate political<br />\nreactions on the part of a larger population being<br />\nnow deprived of even basic means of livelihood.<br />\nWill the response by authority be similar to that<br />\nat Attica? Judging from the letters to the Sun,<br />\nsuch a response would be supported by the majority of the populace. And where will we be<br />\nthefi'?<br />\nwaiting for all the evidence?<br />\nAnd what of our response in the university<br />\ncommunity? /Attica is not a Northern white university. When the Kent State killings occurred we<br />\nresponded instinctively and immediately for it<br />\nwas our kind of institution .,and our kind of people who were threatened. But Attica is only a<br />\nprison and the inhabitants only convicts. They<br />\nare black and Puerto-Rican, poor and ill-educated, while we are educated and have the prospect,<br />\nif not the reality, of a relatively high income. We<br />\nwere surprised when many did not rally to our<br />\ncause at the time of Kent State and Jackson<br />\nState, and yet here we are not rallying to someone else's cause. Most of us pretend we want a<br />\nnew and saner order. Yet somehow we fail to<br />\nrecognize where the most serious barrier lies as<br />\nwe seek ways to bring about change. That barrier<br />\nlies in ourselves. It lies in an intense parochialism<br />\nof interest---an inability to relate to events, institutions and people outside of our immediate<br />\nsphere of interest. It is the inability to see what<br />\nkind of history is currently oeing wntten and to<br />\nunderstand the conceptual limitations laid upon<br />\nus by parochialist ways of thought. Until we<br />\nbreak that bond and reach out to form alliances<br />\nwith all groups in society--convicts, welfare<br />\nrights organizations, black groups, union groups<br />\nand the like---we are doomed to powerlessness<br />\nwhile the inexorable logic of the economic and<br />\nsocial process moves 15 to 25 million people<br />\nnearer to that desperate final confrontation of<br />\nwhich Attica appears but a minor prelude.<br />\n<br />\n\fSept. 28, 1971<br />\n<br />\nPAGE 7<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nBand makes 'questionable' debut<br />\nBy BILL WITTING<br />\nThe soccer and football teams<br />\nwere not the only ones making<br />\ntheir first appearance of the<br />\nseason last Saturday; the Johns<br />\nHopkins University Band<br />\ninexplicably decided that it was<br />\nprepared for a public<br />\npresentation as well, and so<br />\nturned out in questionable<br />\nforce ,to cheer their teams<br />\nonward Wvictory.<br />\n<br />\nThis upstanding group of<br />\nteam supporters showed up not<br />\nonly for the football game, but<br />\nalso for the soccer game<br />\npreceding it\u2014or at least half of<br />\nthem showed up for half of the<br />\nsoccer game. Out they<br />\nwandered five minutes before<br />\nhalftime, laughing and joking,<br />\nmostly in their handsome<br />\nHopkins-emblazoned sports<br />\ncoats,\u2014though one evidently<br />\n<br />\npreferred his Madras jacket<br />\ninstead\u2014filtering into the stands<br />\nwherever they could find<br />\nroom, with the only apparent<br />\norder being that the trombone<br />\nplayers arranged themselves so<br />\nas not to drip their saliva on<br />\nthe trumpet players.<br />\n101 Songs<br />\nIf nearby spectators failed to<br />\nbe disconserted by this<br />\nentrance, they certainly were<br />\n<br />\nEager viewers at Mechanic<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nAn eager audience filed into the Morris<br />\nMechanic Theater last Wednesday night to see<br />\nthe opening of \"No Place to be Somebody.\"<br />\nMany of them were black, most of them were<br />\nyoung, and there was a large sampling of the<br />\nlittle-seen upper class echelons of Baltimore<br />\nblack society.<br />\nA feeling of being predisposed to enjoy the<br />\nplay floated through the chic and modern theater<br />\nas as the audience awaited the curtain's rise, and<br />\nwhen it finally did, we were all impressed with<br />\nthe convincing and detailed stage setting, a West<br />\nGreenwich village bar<br />\nnamed \"Johnny's\" with<br />\nthree tables, the bar,<br />\nand a jukebox.<br />\nA bar is a convenient<br />\nand often-used device<br />\nfor a play, as it allows<br />\ncredible transitions for<br />\nthe for the actors and is popularly conceived of<br />\nas a good place in which to pour out troubles; it<br />\nfits, because this play deals with black-white<br />\nrelationships as confused by human aspirations;<br />\nboth blacks and whites seeing salvation in the<br />\nlife-styles of the other race.<br />\nGabe Gabriel, played by Chuck Daniel, is a<br />\nblack actor who is trying to stop being black;in a<br />\nseries of monologues preceding each act, he rants<br />\nabout how much he has washed and washed,<br />\ntrying to become white, to no avail.<br />\nOn the other hand is Dee, played by Elaine<br />\nKilden; she has the misfortune of being a<br />\nprostitute in love with her pimp, Johnny, bar<br />\nowner and aspiring racketeer. In the last act,<br />\nwhen she finds her love unrequited, she smears<br />\nblack paint on her face in a pitiful but useless<br />\nattempt to change things.<br />\nShanty (Jack Shanahan) is the bar's nigger,<br />\nthough he is white. He carries a set of drumsticks<br />\nthrough his belt loops and once sat in with Max<br />\n<br />\nRoach. However, when the genuine and simple<br />\nblack woman (Shezwae Powell) he is to marry<br />\nfinally scrapes up enough money to buy him a<br />\nset of \"skins', he sits down to a pathetic<br />\nrythin-less banging, which frustrates him into<br />\nviolently shaking his girlfriend by the neck and<br />\ntelling her that they are through. He, too, is<br />\nunable to live up to his racial aspiration.<br />\nCharles Gordone, the author/director of<br />\n\"No Place to be Somebody,\" won a Pulitzer<br />\nPrize for this play, perhaps because it<br />\nincorporates some of the most genuine and<br />\nprevalent black-white sentiments in parts of<br />\ntoday's society; the<br />\ndialogue is often<br />\nriotously funny, and<br />\nrings very true.<br />\nThe printed program<br />\nincludes a 56-item<br />\nglossary, including such<br />\nitems as: COL' CUTS<br />\nAN' FUCK-UPS (cold meat in a package and<br />\npotato chips), YOUR HEAD GOING BACK<br />\nHOME (even if you straighten you hair it will<br />\nstill kink up if you go out in the rain),<br />\nWAMPOLE (champagne, or the best drink in the<br />\nhouse), HARLOWS (re Jean; harlot), and<br />\nCHARLEY FEVER (trying to imitate the white<br />\nman).<br />\nSeveral of the scenes are very forceful; the<br />\nactors are excellent, for the most part, the blacks<br />\nmaybe more so than the whites, but the black<br />\nroles are the better ones. The ending is ,trite and<br />\ntoo simple, though it does make a minor moral<br />\npoint. (Sellin' newspapers and becomin'<br />\nPresident is better than hustling).<br />\nThe whole play is a trifle too long, with two<br />\nintermissions making it close to three hours, but<br />\nthey are an entertaining and worthwhile three<br />\nhours, including the intermissions.<br />\n\"No Place to be Somebody\" will continue at<br />\nthe Mechanic for several more weeks.<br />\n<br />\n\"genuine<br />\nand prevalent<br />\nblack-white<br />\nsentiments\"<br />\n<br />\nfeiffer YOU 1715GOST<br />\n<br />\n11J FACT -INERT ARf\u2022<br />\nGOEN YOU<br />\nFORPER CV THE<br />\n-TEROF(c.<br />\n<br />\ntr 14/465 H6 50:<br />\n-ro WOK Al YOU,<br />\n<br />\nMORE 1,/ei 6soiv<br />\nWi C5P8E<br />\nVOU!<br />\n<br />\namused by the sounds which<br />\nemitted from that end of the<br />\nstands minutes later.

Another<br />\npersonal foul, this time a<br />\nroughing the passer penalty, gave<br />\nthe Jays a first down at theMules<br />\n16. Robey untracked himself for<br />\na six yard gain to the Mules' ten,<br />\nWheeler, and once on a<br />\nbig-gaining screen play to<br />\nhalfback Ken Heddon coming<br />\nout of the backfield. With the<br />\nMules' running attack stopped<br />\ncold at the Jays' ten yard line,<br />\nthe Mules called on kicker<br />\nTrygve Kleppinger for a quick<br />\nthree points.

Allen,<br />\nEnglish, is in the midst of his last<br />\nundergraduate class,<br />\nShakespeare. Next semester he<br />\nwill continue with a graduate<br />\nseminar but otherwise will no<br />\nlonger teach in class.<br />\nMr. Allen is already three<br />\nYears over retirement age, but<br />\n\u2022 has still sparkled wittily in<br />\nEnglish classes here. His special<br />\nfield . is .16th and 17th century<br />\nlite:r.ature and his favorite<br />\ncourses have been Shakespeare<br />\nand Milton.<br />\nWizardly Gentleman<br />\nHearing Dr. Allen in a<br />\nShakespeare class is to hear a<br />\nperky stream of detatched and<br />\nhumorous insights. With it all<br /><br />\ncomes an intuitive sense of the<br />\nplays: their characters, spirit and<br />\nlooming behind the lectern, the<br />\nwizardly white-haired old<br />\ngentleman who larkishly keeps<br />\npeople chuckling.<br />\nIt all began back at the<br />\nUniversity of Illinois where Dr.<br />\nAllen started his sophomore year<br />\nin 1932 with the intention of<br />\nmajoring in Bacteriology, a sort<br />\nof ancient form of modern<br />\nbiology. He enrolled in an<br />\nEnglish class devised for science<br />\nmajors, and thanks to the<br />\nteacher, Bruce Weirick, he soon<br />\nfound himself majoring in<br />\nEnglish literature. \"If it hadn't<br />\nbeen for Mr. Weirick,\" Allen<br />\nsays, \"I'd probably be working<br />\nas a chemist in some cheese<br />\nfactory now.\"<br /><br />\nCo-eds Unable to Get<br />\nContraceptives Here<br /><br />\nAt Illinois, Don Allen was also<br />\neditor-in -chief of the Daily<br />\nIllinois. \"Those were the<br />\nsporting page days,\" he says.<br />\n\"There was little interest in<br />\npolitics, economics or the<br />\nin tellectual world. Everything<br />\nwas simple minded compared to<br />\nnow. Kids had an eagerness for<br />\nsecurity and a good safe job.\"<br />\nBeer was King<br />\nThat's changed now and Dr.<br />\nAllen is happy. \"Students don't<br />\naccept things blindly as they<br />\nused to, and that's how progress<br />\nis made. Leading thinkers always<br />\nstart by doubting what is being<br />\nsaid.\"<br />\n. Campus life at ,Illinois was<br />\npretty different too. \"Girls had<br />\nto be in at 10:00 and publishing<br />\nsatire on Urbana could get you<br />\nin hot water in nothing flat. Beer<br />\nwas the end; the modern<br />\nundergrad doesn't realize what<br />\nthose days were like.\"<br />\nAt Hopkins, Don Allen has<br />\nbeen very happy. He particularly<br />\nenjoys the academic freedom of<br />\nreading and saying what he<br />\npleases in class.<br />\nBefore coming to Hopkins in<br />\n1941, Allen had taught at Purd-<br /><br />\nD. C'. Allen<br />\nue, Washington State, Illinois,<br />\nWeslyan, Colorado,<br />\nNorthwestern and Duke. \"This is<br />\nthe freest school I've been at,\"<br />\nhe says, \"The administration has<br />\nnever interfered in any way with<br />\nmy work. At other places a rich<br />\ntrustee or alumni would call me<br />\nup and wonder why their kid<br />\nwasn't a brilliant English<br />\nstudent. Then they'd pressure<br />\nthe administration. Nothing like<br />\nthat, has ever happened here.<br />\nProfessors have been<br />\ntraditionally judged on one<br /><br />\nthing, their performance.\"<br />\nAllen also appreciates students<br />\nat Hopkins and is<br />\nrelieved that education here has<br />\noutgrown the system of<br />\n\"returning vomit to the dog\"<br />\nthat characterized many of his<br />\nearlier teaching jobs.<br />\nHe remembers his early years<br />\nat Hopkins when there were just<br />\nfour people in the English<br />\ndepartment, three in History and<br />\nfour in Romance languages.<br />\n\"Nine people came to a baseball<br />\ngame once,\" he said, referring to<br />\nthe Hopkins team. \"There were<br />\njust six buildings. Merganthaler<br />\nwas just finished and the library<br />\nwas in Gilman.\"<br />\nAllen considers the Hopkins<br />\nEnglish department as one of the<br />\nbest in the country. \"With our<br />\neight or nine people, the<br />\nnational appraisal still puts us<br />\neighth in the country. That's<br />\nhigher than any other<br />\ndepartment here at Hopkins,<br />\nexcept maybe Biology.\"<br />\nD. C. Allen can't think of<br />\nanother school in the U.S. that<br />\nhe would have been happier at<br />\nthan Hopkins. \"I even wish I'd<br />\nbeen an undergraduate here.\"<br /><br />\nLow Prices at Hopkins Club<br /><br />\nRoy W.

The ruling<br />\nsaid that students could not be excluded from voting because they are temporary residents, thus making them eligible to vote in their college communities. Coupled with<br />\nthe Constitutional amendment and state law providing for<br />\nan 18-year-old vote, this decision enables us at once to<br />\nplay a significant role in area politics, as well as to avoid<br />\nthe difficulties of absentee voting in our home states. Now<br />\nthe prime obstacle to participation is only our own apathy.<br />\nHere at Hopkins we should resist what seems to be a national trend of low registration, and make our presence felt<br />\nin the upcoming Presidential election year. And in future<br />\nyears, students will be able to do more than just lick envelopes in the campaigns of Congressmen, Senators, Assemblymen and City Councilmen.<br />\nIn some communities, like Berkeley, young voters have<br />\nbeen able to radicalize city government, and the same prospect seems likely in the youth-dominated community of<br />\nCollege Park, Maryland. In the Baltimore area, of course,<br />\nsuch a political enclave is improbable, but the student vote<br />\nwill, hopefully, force most city candidates to demonstrate<br />\nThe immediate opportunity,<br />\ngreater social concern.<br />\nthough, is the primary in May,and in this state at least we<br />\ndon't have to stand idly by as figures such as Henry Jackson or Edmund Muskie make their bids for victory.<br /><br />\nCampus meetings<br />\nThose two venerable Hopkins bodies politic, the faculty General Assembly and the Student Council met this<br />\nweek with the General Assembly looking like an efficient,<br />\nintelligent group of men compared to our top student governing body. We wish this decision were a surprise, but it's<br />\nbeginning to become a sure thing. The SC spent mr)st of its<br />\nmeeting berating the News-Letter for inacuracies and mistakes which they failed to specify. We will gladly correct<br />\nany errors we have made, but so far, none have been pointed out, only vaguely hinted at. Other than that, the Council did nothing.<br />\nThe General Assembly was energetic and full of life in<br />\ncomparison, appointing no less than two new committees,<br />\nwith a slight chance that these new groups might benefit<br />\nstudents. It is about time that the professors 'got involved<br />\nin the admissions procedure, and a committee was formed<br />\nto work with that office in changing Hopkins' image.<br />\nHopefully this will do more than give sterile advice, actually getting out and talking to potential matriculates in attempting to balance out the spread of majors. But if this<br />\ncommittee is successful, and Dr. Eisenhower's predicted<br />\ninflux of new students occurs, we hope the General Assembly will see fit to appoint another to get a few more course<br />\nofferings.<br />\nIn their other action, the Assembly struck a blow for<br />\nteaching by appointing a committee to review promotions<br />\nand appointments with teaching in mind. It is not clear<br />\nhow this body will differ from the Academic Council in its<br />\nactions, but seemingly it cannot hurt.<br /><br />\nSept. 28,1971<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nLetters to<br />\nthe Editors<br /><br />\nDecision Maker<br /><br />\nTOUCHE,ZORRO<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nLast year there was hope that<br />\nthe Newsletter was finally<br />\ngrowing up, cleaning the New<br />\nLeft muck off its rear end, and<br />\nbecoming -- if not completely<br />\nopen and unbiased -- at least a<br />\nshade less one-sided, but it seems<br />\nthis feeling was premature.

We feel this<br />\nway about Attica. What really happened? Who<br />\nkilled whom?<br />\no ordered what when? 'RR our<br />\npast experience must surely tell us that it is folly<br />\nto wait. Reports and commissions after an event<br />\nusually confirm first impressions or turn out to<br />\nbe so ambiguous that they can be used as proof<br />\nfor anything. And in the process of waiting for<br />\nall the evidence, we lose the most important weapon we possess--the ability to react quickly and<br />\neffectively to events as they happen. So it is essential that we react to Attica now, using all the<br />\ninformation that we have at our command. There<br />\nare two sources of information---the reports on<br />\nthe event and the social, economic and political<br />\ncontext which makes such an event possible and<br />\ncredible to us as part of the dynamic of the society in which we live.<br />\nEconomically, we are in crisis. A high unemployment rate is associated with too few resources to go around and a rapid inflation. This economic crisis must be brought under control and,<br />\nin the process, somebody somewhere must suffer. The present social, economic and institutional structure dictates that it cannot be capitalist<br />\nenterprise.<br />\nThe brunt of the economic burden must thus fall elsewhere. The primary attack<br />\nis upon welfare and government spending in socially relavant areas. A second attack is upon,<br />\nwage earners.<br />\nThere is also evidence<br />\nthat government agencies are moving to adopt<br />\npolicies that involve the withdrawal of support<br />\nfor large parts of the inner city .<br />\nWho are prisoners and where do they come<br />\nfron't4. where are about a half million prisoners<br />\nnow in jail and most come from the ranks of the<br />\npoor and the inner cities. The groups and areas<br />\nfrom which prisoners come are now about to be<br />\nsqueezed even harder. Even the Eisenhower Commission on Violence recognized the social and<br />\neconomic origins of much \"criminal\" activity.<br />\nWhat else can people do when they are unemployed, when welfare payments are totally inadequate, when social services are reduced even further in the name of efficiency and budgetary solvency TN results must surely bring an increase<br />\nin the prison population which is already experiencing one of its biggest booms in history. To be<br />\nin prison is like being on the worst kind of wel- \u2022<br />\nfare society can offer---57 cents a day for food<br />\nsomebody told me. In prison we find the most<br />\ndegraded form of human life. It is at the prison<br />\ngates that the last hint of liberal reformism ends<br />\nand genuine fascist society---a microcosm of it to<br />\nbe sure---begins. Brutality, rascism, sadism degradation here reign supreme, all in the name of<br />\ncorrection, rather than in their true guise---as vengence upon those whose condition is a continuous reproach to the whole of society Prisoners<br />\nhave learned from bitter experience that society<br />\nDr. David Harvey is an Associate Professor in<br />\nthe Department of Geography<br /><br />\nwon't or can't listen unless prisoners draw attention to their plight by forceful action. In the<br />\nprocess, prisoners become politicized and take<br />\npolitical action. They are then branded as \"militants\" or, as Commissioner Oswald called them<br />\nin Attica, \"Maoists.\"<br />\nWhat of the of4cial response at Attici? We<br />\nknow that Roctcefeller ordered the use of force,<br />\nthat he consulted with the President's office beforehand and was commended by the President<br />\nimmediately afterwards. It was obvious that killing would result. However, the unashamed use of<br />\nfire power is new. Killings have occurred before,<br />\nof course, but never with the full weight of authority in favor of such a violent response. Why<br />\nnow so overt? .Because the threat posed by the<br />\nsoners is substantially greater than that of, say,<br />\nrioting students at Kent State. The political<br />\nalignments and divisions generated through racism and economic distrust also encourage elected officials to respond violently in order to reap<br />\npolitical support to get re-elected as \"decisive\"<br />\nheros---hence the unseemly haste with which<br />\nRockefeller proudly assumed responsibility for<br />\nAttica.The current economic squeeze on the poor<br />\nand the withdrawal of support from the inner<br />\ncity can all too easily lead to desperate political<br />\nreactions on the part of a larger population being<br />\nnow deprived of even basic means of livelihood.<br />\nWill the response by authority be similar to that<br />\nat Attica? Judging from the letters to the Sun,<br />\nsuch a response would be supported by the majority of the populace. And where will we be<br />\nthefi'?<br />\nwaiting for all the evidence?<br />\nAnd what of our response in the university<br />\ncommunity? /Attica is not a Northern white university. When the Kent State killings occurred we<br />\nresponded instinctively and immediately for it<br />\nwas our kind of institution .,and our kind of people who were threatened. But Attica is only a<br />\nprison and the inhabitants only convicts. They<br />\nare black and Puerto-Rican, poor and ill-educated, while we are educated and have the prospect,<br />\nif not the reality, of a relatively high income. We<br />\nwere surprised when many did not rally to our<br />\ncause at the time of Kent State and Jackson<br />\nState, and yet here we are not rallying to someone else's cause. Most of us pretend we want a<br />\nnew and saner order. Yet somehow we fail to<br />\nrecognize where the most serious barrier lies as<br />\nwe seek ways to bring about change. That barrier<br />\nlies in ourselves. It lies in an intense parochialism<br />\nof interest---an inability to relate to events, institutions and people outside of our immediate<br />\nsphere of interest.

Out they<br />\nwandered five minutes before<br />\nhalftime, laughing and joking,<br />\nmostly in their handsome<br />\nHopkins-emblazoned sports<br />\ncoats,\u2014though one evidently<br /><br />\npreferred his Madras jacket<br />\ninstead\u2014filtering into the stands<br />\nwherever they could find<br />\nroom, with the only apparent<br />\norder being that the trombone<br />\nplayers arranged themselves so<br />\nas not to drip their saliva on<br />\nthe trumpet players.<br />\n101 Songs<br />\nIf nearby spectators failed to<br />\nbe disconserted by this<br />\nentrance, they certainly were<br /><br />\nEager viewers at Mechanic<br />\nBy DANIEL EPSTEIN<br />\nAn eager audience filed into the Morris<br />\nMechanic Theater last Wednesday night to see<br />\nthe opening of \"No Place to be Somebody.\"<br />\nMany of them were black, most of them were<br />\nyoung, and there was a large sampling of the<br />\nlittle-seen upper class echelons of Baltimore<br />\nblack society.<br />\nA feeling of being predisposed to enjoy the<br />\nplay floated through the chic and modern theater<br />\nas as the audience awaited the curtain's rise, and<br />\nwhen it finally did, we were all impressed with<br />\nthe convincing and detailed stage setting, a West<br />\nGreenwich village bar<br />\nnamed \"Johnny's\" with<br />\nthree tables, the bar,<br />\nand a jukebox.<br />\nA bar is a convenient<br />\nand often-used device<br />\nfor a play, as it allows<br />\ncredible transitions for<br />\nthe for the actors and is popularly conceived of<br />\nas a good place in which to pour out troubles; it<br />\nfits, because this play deals with black-white<br />\nrelationships as confused by human aspirations;<br />\nboth blacks and whites seeing salvation in the<br />\nlife-styles of the other race.<br />\nGabe Gabriel, played by Chuck Daniel, is a<br />\nblack actor who is trying to stop being black;in a<br />\nseries of monologues preceding each act, he rants<br />\nabout how much he has washed and washed,<br />\ntrying to become white, to no avail.<br />\nOn the other hand is Dee, played by Elaine<br />\nKilden; she has the misfortune of being a<br />\nprostitute in love with her pimp, Johnny, bar<br />\nowner and aspiring racketeer. In the last act,<br />\nwhen she finds her love unrequited, she smears<br />\nblack paint on her face in a pitiful but useless<br />\nattempt to change things.<br />\nShanty (Jack Shanahan) is the bar's nigger,<br />\nthough he is white. He carries a set of drumsticks<br />\nthrough his belt loops and once sat in with Max<br /><br />\nRoach. However, when the genuine and simple<br />\nblack woman (Shezwae Powell) he is to marry<br />\nfinally scrapes up enough money to buy him a<br />\nset of \"skins', he sits down to a pathetic<br />\nrythin-less banging, which frustrates him into<br />\nviolently shaking his girlfriend by the neck and<br />\ntelling her that they are through. He, too, is<br />\nunable to live up to his racial aspiration.<br />\nCharles Gordone, the author/director of<br />\n\"No Place to be Somebody,\" won a Pulitzer<br />\nPrize for this play, perhaps because it<br />\nincorporates some of the most genuine and<br />\nprevalent black-white sentiments in parts of<br />\ntoday's society; the<br />\ndialogue is often<br />\nriotously funny, and<br />\nrings very true.<br />\nThe printed program<br />\nincludes a 56-item<br />\nglossary, including such<br />\nitems as: COL' CUTS<br />\nAN' FUCK-UPS (cold meat in a package and<br />\npotato chips), YOUR HEAD GOING BACK<br />\nHOME (even if you straighten you hair it will<br />\nstill kink up if you go out in the rain),<br />\nWAMPOLE (champagne, or the best drink in the<br />\nhouse), HARLOWS (re Jean; harlot), and<br />\nCHARLEY FEVER (trying to imitate the white<br />\nman).<br />\nSeveral of the scenes are very forceful; the<br />\nactors are excellent, for the most part, the blacks<br />\nmaybe more so than the whites, but the black<br />\nroles are the better ones. The ending is ,trite and<br />\ntoo simple, though it does make a minor moral<br />\npoint. (Sellin' newspapers and becomin'<br />\nPresident is better than hustling).<br />\nThe whole play is a trifle too long, with two<br />\nintermissions making it close to three hours, but<br />\nthey are an entertaining and worthwhile three<br />\nhours, including the intermissions.<br />\n\"No Place to be Somebody\" will continue at<br />\nthe Mechanic for several more weeks.<br /><br />\n\"genuine<br />\nand prevalent<br />\nblack-white<br />\nsentiments\"<br /><br />\nfeiffer YOU 1715GOST<br /><br />\n11J FACT -INERT ARf\u2022<br />\nGOEN YOU<br />\nFORPER CV THE<br />\n-TEROF(c.<br /><br />\ntr 14/465 H6 50:<br />\n-ro WOK Al YOU,<br /><br />\nMORE 1,/ei 6soiv<br />\nWi C5P8E<br />\nVOU!<br /><br />\namused by the sounds which<br />\nemitted from that end of the<br />\nstands minutes later.
