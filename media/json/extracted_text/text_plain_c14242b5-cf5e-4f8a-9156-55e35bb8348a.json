B. AMES SPEAKS ON<br />\n\"NEW BALTIC STATES\"<br />\n\"The future holds much in store<br />\nfor the three new Baltic states. After<br />\nhaving been kept down for so many<br />\nyears their progress should be steady<br />\nand rapid,\" said Sir Herbert Brown<br />\nAmes, former member of Parliament and financial director of the<br />\nLeague of Nations in a lecture delivered Monday afternoon in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building on \"The<br />\nNew Baltic States.\"<br />\nThese three states, which have<br />\narisen out of the war, have long<br />\nbeen struggling to obtain their freedom. Although different racially<br />\nand religiously, they have this one<br />\ndesire in common. Lithuania is Roman Catholic and Indo-European.<br />\nEsthonia is Lutheran Protestant and<br />\nIndo-European. Latvia is Lutheran<br />\nProtestant and Finnish. After having secured their freedom, all propose to maintain absolute independence.<br />\nAs Sir Herbert Ames pointed out,<br />\nLithuania at one time stretched from<br />\nthe Baltic to the Black Sea. When<br />\nthe country was incorporated in the<br />\nRussian revolution Lithuania, like<br />\ninstitutions destroyed there, still remained an intense longing for liberty. In 1905 during the general<br />\nRussian revolution Lithuania like<br />\nEsthonia and Latvia, made a futile<br />\neffort to break from the empire.<br />\nDuring the World War all three<br />\ncountries loyally stood by the Czar:<br />\nbut the German troops quickly overran Lithuania. After the signing of<br />\nthe Russo-German peace, Germany<br />\nbegan to prepare Lithuania for incorporation into Prussia. But at<br />\nVersailles Lithuania was freed, now<br />\nhaving to protect herself from the<br />\nBolsheviki. Finally in 1920, after<br />\nlosing part of her territory to Poland, Lithuania obtained recognition from the League, and at the<br />\n:second meeting of that body, membership in it.<br />\nIn Latvia and Esthonia a slightly<br />\ndifferent struggle took place. In<br />\nLatvia the land was owned by a<br />\nsmall German class, who tried to<br />\nimpose their culture on the people.<br />\nWhen the German armies finally<br />\nbroke down the Russian defences,<br />\nthis land-owning class prepared for<br />\nannexation. After the German defeat, however, the people elected a<br />\nnational assembly and carried on<br />\nwar with the Soviet. The Germans<br />\nwere practically expropriated and<br />\nthe land given to the people.<br />\n\"In all of these countries,\" Sir<br />\nHerbert Ames went on, \"there is no<br />\nobjection to a close economic cooperation with Russia. What they<br />\nwant is political independence.\" Russia has the use of the ports and railroad facilities. Each state has a<br />\ndemocratic republican form of government with direct, equal, proportional suffrage of both sexes. They<br />\nare enthusiastic over their newly<br />\nwon independence.<br />\nNEW COTILLON BOARD<br />\n(Continued from page 1, column 3.)<br />\n<br />\nall activities, will be taken care of by<br />\nthe Student Activities Board. Officers for the first year of the newly<br />\norganized Cotillon Club will be appointed by the Student Council but<br />\nwill be elected in future years.<br />\nThe membership of the new board<br />\nwill consist of two members from<br />\neach class; the Student Council will<br />\npick the representatives from the<br />\n.upper classes and these men will<br />\nelect representatives from the freshman class. A surplus of a hundred<br />\ndollars must be left each year in<br />\nthe treasury of the board and the<br />\nremaining profits, if any, are to be<br />\ndivided between the A. A. Board<br />\nand June Week. A representative<br />\nfrom the A. A. Board and the Student Council will be ex-officio members of the new Cotillon Board.

The campus is<br />\nher market and the number of college romances bear out this fact.<br />\n<br />\nThe Western Association of' College Comics has unanimously voted<br />\nto break their contract for reprint<br />\nrights with College Humor. Their<br />\nreason for adopting this rather radical stand are interesting. The president of the Association has stated:<br />\n\"Our reason for breaking the contract is that we feel that College<br />\nHumor is painting a picture of<br />\nflaming youth which is not real, and<br />\nwhich gives to the average reade<br />\na false conception of college lif<br />\nTypical college humour is repr<br />\nsented by gin and sex jokes whi<br />\nclean humor which is representati<br />\nof college life is omitted.\" The a<br />\nsociation hopes that this action m<br />\ninaugurate a universal revolt-agai<br />\ndistorted pictures of American c<br />\nlegians.<br />\n<br />\nTHE GIANT<br />\nPOWER FUEL<br />\n<br />\nESSO<br />\n<br />\nNEW LIFE<br />\nFOR MOTORS<br />\n<br />\n\"STANDARD\" MOTOR OIL<br />\nThe Measure of Oil Value<br />\nSJANDARD OIL COMPANY OF N.

B. AMES SPEAKS ON<br />\n\"NEW BALTIC STATES\"<br />\n\"The future holds much in store<br />\nfor the three new Baltic states. After<br />\nhaving been kept down for so many<br />\nyears their progress should be steady<br />\nand rapid,\" said Sir Herbert Brown<br />\nAmes, former member of Parliament and financial director of the<br />\nLeague of Nations in a lecture delivered Monday afternoon in the<br />\nCivil Engineering Building on \"The<br />\nNew Baltic States.\"<br />\nThese three states, which have<br />\narisen out of the war, have long<br />\nbeen struggling to obtain their freedom. Although different racially<br />\nand religiously, they have this one<br />\ndesire in common. Lithuania is Roman Catholic and Indo-European.<br />\nEsthonia is Lutheran Protestant and<br />\nIndo-European. Latvia is Lutheran<br />\nProtestant and Finnish. After having secured their freedom, all propose to maintain absolute independence.<br />\nAs Sir Herbert Ames pointed out,<br />\nLithuania at one time stretched from<br />\nthe Baltic to the Black Sea. When<br />\nthe country was incorporated in the<br />\nRussian revolution Lithuania, like<br />\ninstitutions destroyed there, still remained an intense longing for liberty. In 1905 during the general<br />\nRussian revolution Lithuania like<br />\nEsthonia and Latvia, made a futile<br />\neffort to break from the empire.<br />\nDuring the World War all three<br />\ncountries loyally stood by the Czar:<br />\nbut the German troops quickly overran Lithuania. After the signing of<br />\nthe Russo-German peace, Germany<br />\nbegan to prepare Lithuania for incorporation into Prussia. But at<br />\nVersailles Lithuania was freed, now<br />\nhaving to protect herself from the<br />\nBolsheviki. Finally in 1920, after<br />\nlosing part of her territory to Poland, Lithuania obtained recognition from the League, and at the<br />\n:second meeting of that body, membership in it.<br />\nIn Latvia and Esthonia a slightly<br />\ndifferent struggle took place. In<br />\nLatvia the land was owned by a<br />\nsmall German class, who tried to<br />\nimpose their culture on the people.<br />\nWhen the German armies finally<br />\nbroke down the Russian defences,<br />\nthis land-owning class prepared for<br />\nannexation. After the German defeat, however, the people elected a<br />\nnational assembly and carried on<br />\nwar with the Soviet. The Germans<br />\nwere practically expropriated and<br />\nthe land given to the people.<br />\n\"In all of these countries,\" Sir<br />\nHerbert Ames went on, \"there is no<br />\nobjection to a close economic cooperation with Russia. What they<br />\nwant is political independence.\" Russia has the use of the ports and railroad facilities. Each state has a<br />\ndemocratic republican form of government with direct, equal, proportional suffrage of both sexes. They<br />\nare enthusiastic over their newly<br />\nwon independence.<br />\nNEW COTILLON BOARD<br />\n(Continued from page 1, column 3.)<br /><br />\nall activities, will be taken care of by<br />\nthe Student Activities Board. Officers for the first year of the newly<br />\norganized Cotillon Club will be appointed by the Student Council but<br />\nwill be elected in future years.<br />\nThe membership of the new board<br />\nwill consist of two members from<br />\neach class; the Student Council will<br />\npick the representatives from the<br />\n.upper classes and these men will<br />\nelect representatives from the freshman class.
