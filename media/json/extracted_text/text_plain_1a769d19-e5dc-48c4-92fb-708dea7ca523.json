He<br />\ntold of the present problems in the<br />\nfield of social studies and pointed out<br />\nseveral of the problems to be faced<br />\nwhen peace comes again.

October 25, Dr<br />\nHunt countered charges recently<br />\nvoiced by other professors, including<br />\nAllan Nevins of the same university,<br />\nthat the 'social studies' have been<br />\ndriving the study of American history from the public schools.<br />\nNot only have American history<br />\ncourses been made more intensive<br />\nand thorough, asserted Professor<br />\nHunt, but the fact that the average<br />\nstudent of today remains in school<br />\nlonger than the one of a few decades<br />\nago means that these courses are<br />\nstudied by more people.<br />\nHowever, Dr Hunt admitted that<br />\nseveral of the points in the opposition's case were true. American<br />\nhistory has steadily broadened in<br />\nscope, yet the public schools have<br />\nnot, as a rule, increased the number<br />\nof their courses in it. Further, the<br />\nincreased enrollment in high schools<br />\nhas come largely from low-ability<br />\nstudents, and this trend has prevented teaehers from expanding their<br />\ncourses to keep pace with the broadening of the subject. In addition,<br />\nthe repetition of facts in successive<br />\ncourses in history, for the benefit<br />\nof the poorer students, often- serves \u2022<br />\nto deter initiative on the part of the<br />\nn<br />\nbrsytt<br />\n_<br />\nFinally, Professor Hunt agrees<br />\nthat many American history teachers<br />\nhave not been adequately prepared<br />\nfor their subject.

The freshmen stormed<br />\naround to the front door of B entry,<br />\nonly to find it barricaded. After the<br />\nupperclassmen had rounded up all<br />\nof the upperclass residents of B entry,<br />\nthey opened the door and a battle<br />\nroyal ensued in the front hall. Then<br />\nthe upperclassmen rushed over to'<br />\nE entry, and added a few.more cohorts to their cause. By this time,<br />\nthe upperclassmen outnumbered the<br />\nfreshmen, so they stayed out of E<br />\nentry and chased the hapless freshmen over various outlying portions<br />\nof the campus. Later that night, a<br />\nsmall group of upperclassmen hung<br />\nan effigy of Fred Weekes from Gilman hall. This effigy was torn down<br />\nearly Friday morning by the freshmen.<br />\n<br />\nSPE house. When the freshmen were<br />\nunable to find Springer at the ETA<br />\nhouse ,they decided to try the ATO<br />\nhouse,but they didn't have any more<br />\nluck there. By the time the freshmen<br />\nhad gotten around to investigating<br />\nthe SPE house, Springer had been<br />\nshifted back to the ETA house. So<br />\nthe freshmen decided to give the DU<br />\nhouse a thorough looking-into.<br />\nAnd this was where the upperclassmen had a stroke of bad luck. As the<br />\nfreshmen milled about the alley back<br />\nof the DU house, Lorin Stieff and<br />\nanother AD came wandering innocently along. Now, as it happened,<br />\nStieff and his friend knew absolutely<br />\nnothing about Springer's whereabouts, but the freshmen were sure<br />\nthey did, so they tagged along behind<br />\nthem.<br />\nMeanwhile, the boys at the ETA<br />\nhouse had sent for a taxi to take<br />\nSpringer away.,The taxi pulled up at<br />\nthe back door of the ETA house and<br />\nSpringer was hustled into it just<br />\nabout the time that the freshmen<br />\nrounded the corner of the alley behind Stieff. As soon as they spied the<br />\ncab, they made a concerted rush for<br />\nit. The upperclassmen might still<br />\nhave gotten Springer safely away,<br />\nbut for the fact that the driver stalled<br />\nthe motor. So the freshmen surrounded the cab and 'escorted Springer off<br />\ntriumphantly.<br />\n<br />\nCuller Nabbed at KA House<br />\nA little later in the afternoon the<br />\nfreshmen stormed the KA house and<br />\nnabbed Floyd Culler, junior class<br />\npresident.

He<br />\ntold of the present problems in the<br />\nfield of social studies and pointed out<br />\nseveral of the problems to be faced<br />\nwhen peace comes again. After the<br />\nspeech, there was an open discussion<br />\nof the subject.<br />\nThe meeting was presided over by<br />\nDr Florence Barnberger, direutor of<br />\nthe college for Teachers.<br />\nIn an articl in the New York<br />\nTimes of Sunday. October 25, Dr<br />\nHunt countered charges recently<br />\nvoiced by other professors, including<br />\nAllan Nevins of the same university,<br />\nthat the 'social studies' have been<br />\ndriving the study of American history from the public schools.<br />\nNot only have American history<br />\ncourses been made more intensive<br />\nand thorough, asserted Professor<br />\nHunt, but the fact that the average<br />\nstudent of today remains in school<br />\nlonger than the one of a few decades<br />\nago means that these courses are<br />\nstudied by more people.<br />\nHowever, Dr Hunt admitted that<br />\nseveral of the points in the opposition's case were true. American<br />\nhistory has steadily broadened in<br />\nscope, yet the public schools have<br />\nnot, as a rule, increased the number<br />\nof their courses in it. Further, the<br />\nincreased enrollment in high schools<br />\nhas come largely from low-ability<br />\nstudents, and this trend has prevented teaehers from expanding their<br />\ncourses to keep pace with the broadening of the subject. In addition,<br />\nthe repetition of facts in successive<br />\ncourses in history, for the benefit<br />\nof the poorer students, often- serves \u2022<br />\nto deter initiative on the part of the<br />\nn<br />\nbrsytt<br />\n_<br />\nFinally, Professor Hunt agrees<br />\nthat many American history teachers<br />\nhave not been adequately prepared<br />\nfor their subject. But he asserts<br />\nthat all of these weaknesses are receiving attention by local and state<br />\nauthorities.<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nPAGE FOUR<br /><br />\n(Continued from Page 1)<br />\nmusic, so did Teagarden apply the<br />\nvarious blues phrases that he heard<br />\nto the trombone.<br />\nWhen Jack was 15 years old he<br />\nlanded his first job as a professional<br />\nmusician, playing with a four piece<br />\nband in San Antonio.

The freshmen stormed<br />\naround to the front door of B entry,<br />\nonly to find it barricaded. After the<br />\nupperclassmen had rounded up all<br />\nof the upperclass residents of B entry,<br />\nthey opened the door and a battle<br />\nroyal ensued in the front hall. Then<br />\nthe upperclassmen rushed over to'<br />\nE entry, and added a few.more cohorts to their cause. By this time,<br />\nthe upperclassmen outnumbered the<br />\nfreshmen, so they stayed out of E<br />\nentry and chased the hapless freshmen over various outlying portions<br />\nof the campus. Later that night, a<br />\nsmall group of upperclassmen hung<br />\nan effigy of Fred Weekes from Gilman hall. This effigy was torn down<br />\nearly Friday morning by the freshmen.<br /><br />\nSPE house. When the freshmen were<br />\nunable to find Springer at the ETA<br />\nhouse ,they decided to try the ATO<br />\nhouse,but they didn't have any more<br />\nluck there. By the time the freshmen<br />\nhad gotten around to investigating<br />\nthe SPE house, Springer had been<br />\nshifted back to the ETA house. So<br />\nthe freshmen decided to give the DU<br />\nhouse a thorough looking-into.<br />\nAnd this was where the upperclassmen had a stroke of bad luck. As the<br />\nfreshmen milled about the alley back<br />\nof the DU house, Lorin Stieff and<br />\nanother AD came wandering innocently along. Now, as it happened,<br />\nStieff and his friend knew absolutely<br />\nnothing about Springer's whereabouts, but the freshmen were sure<br />\nthey did, so they tagged along behind<br />\nthem.<br />\nMeanwhile, the boys at the ETA<br />\nhouse had sent for a taxi to take<br />\nSpringer away.,The taxi pulled up at<br />\nthe back door of the ETA house and<br />\nSpringer was hustled into it just<br />\nabout the time that the freshmen<br />\nrounded the corner of the alley behind Stieff. As soon as they spied the<br />\ncab, they made a concerted rush for<br />\nit. The upperclassmen might still<br />\nhave gotten Springer safely away,<br />\nbut for the fact that the driver stalled<br />\nthe motor. So the freshmen surrounded the cab and 'escorted Springer off<br />\ntriumphantly.<br /><br />\nCuller Nabbed at KA House<br />\nA little later in the afternoon the<br />\nfreshmen stormed the KA house and<br />\nnabbed Floyd Culler, junior class<br />\npresident.
