They worked the ball<br />\ndown the field steadily to the<br />\nHopkins twenty yard line where<br />\non a fourth-and-three situation<br />\nB.J.C. tried a pass which was<br />\nbatted down by the middle of<br />\nthe Hopkins line. With two minutes left to go in the game the<br />\nJays proceeded to run out the<br />\nclock.<br />\nThere were considerable injuries to the yearling squad.<br />\nEarly in the first quarter tackle<br />\nLarry Fields was removed from<br />\nthe game with a broken nose,<br />\nhis place being taken by Dick<br />\nKuney.

The Engineers, who were<br />\nlast year's national champions<br />\nwith a 10-0 record, have a 3-4-1<br />\nmark so far this season. Hampered by injury the Engineers<br />\nstarted the year slowly, but have<br />\nbounced back quite strongly in<br />\ntheir last two contests to post<br />\n8-1 and 8-2 victories.<br />\nThe Drexel pitchmen, who<br />\nhave never been beaten by the<br />\nmen from Homewood, boast a<br />\nstrong offense which relies on<br />\nball control, short passing and<br />\nbrute scoring force. Under the<br />\ncoaching of Dick Younger \u2022 the<br />\nbootmen from Pennsylvania<br />\ntripped the Jays 2-0 last year in<br />\nwhat proved to be a very exciting<br />\nand hard-played ballgame.<br />\nThe men in Blue scored their<br />\n<br />\nmost of the way. In spite of<br />\nthe inclement weather, Jim<br />\nFitzpatrick and the two Swarthmore runners who preceded him<br />\nall broke the Hopkins course<br />\nrecord handily.

The home<br />\nclub took the ball on its own 39<br />\nand took six plays to advance<br />\n31 yards to the Swarthmore 30.<br />\nFrom there Leet took the ball<br />\nand blasted over center, running<br />\nover two would-be- tacklers, to<br />\nscore. Pat Boyer added the first<br />\nof his three successful conversions for a 7-0 Hopkins lead.<br />\nOnly Concerted Drive<br />\nThe second scoring drive was<br />\ninitiated when Jerry Erdman<br />\npicked off an errant Garnet<br />\npass on the visitors' 44.

The big<br />\nJay fullback-climaxed the march<br />\nwith a one-yard scoring plunge.<br />\nThe TD gave him a team -topping<br />\n44 points on the season.
