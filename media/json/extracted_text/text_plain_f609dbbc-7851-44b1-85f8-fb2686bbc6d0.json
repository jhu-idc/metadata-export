Whether<br />\njustified or not, the campus is interpreting the facts in<br />\nthis case to mean that one must forgo this type of<br />\nacademic recognition if one wants to be in the leadership of a progressive movement. And that is the impression which must be corrected\u2014if there is no<br />\nfoundation for it.<br />\nIf there is any information to be obtained or ideas<br />\nto be exchanged, attend this meeting. If you think our<br />\nstand is unfair or unjustified, let us know. One of the<br />\nways to settle this problem is to intelligently exchange<br />\nideas and consider the situation carefully.<br />\nThere is no doubt that in order to get something done<br />\nwe have to crystallize our sentiment.

Thus, more than half the more<br />\nactive section of the student .body has no representation<br />\non the strike committee.<br />\nCan it be that these organizations are opposed to<br />\npeace as a principle? But, in every poll on the question<br />\nin \u2022the last few years, the Hopkins has manifested a<br />\ndeep-seated distaste for Mars and all his works.<br />\nThere is another more likely possibility. Is this<br />\napathy indicative of the feeling that, behind the strike's<br />\ninnocent exterior, subversive forces are moving? In<br />\nother words, the claim is that we who support the strike<br />\nhave been duped by agents of some foreign ideology.<br />\nThat contention is best answered by the list of organizations now represented on the committee. They are,<br />\nat last account, the Student Council, the Hullabaloo,<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa, the NEWS-LETTER, the Debating<br />\nCouncil, -the Y.M.C.A., the Student Activities Committee,<br />\nPhi Sigma Delta, Phi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi, the Young<br />\nCommunist League, and the American Student Union.<br />\nOf these, only the last two can, \u2022by any stretch of the<br />\nimagination, be influenced by radical opinion. Three,<br />\nin fact, are social fraternities, traditionally the chief<br />\nobject of attack from the left. The ratio is ten to two\u2014<br />\nhardly an overwhelming preponderance for \"unsafe\"<br />\nopinions.<br />\nThe truth is, of course, that the questions of war and<br />\npeace transcend political lines. Every decent citizen<br />\nhopes with all his heart to keep the world in safety.<br />\nAnd these organizations, so varied in composition, who<br />\nhave joined in the strike, have shown that they regard<br />\nthe threat of war as bigger than their minor differences.<br />\nThey have shown that they regard the fight for peace<br />\nas something more than the personal property of some<br />\nforeign peril\u2014whether it be Black, Yellow, or Red.<br />\n<br />\nD(<br />\nMi<br />\nFr<br />\ncoll.<br />\n<br />\nLETTER TO<br />\nTHE EDITOR<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nThe fact that Maurice Shils, \"seventh-ranking student in his class<br />\nand chairman of the American Student Union,\" was rejected for Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa seems to me to be significant, not so much because an injustice was done to this individual<br />\nas because this represents an apparent attempt to terrorize progressive<br />\nstudent thought and action at the<br />\nHopkins by making an object lesson<br />\nof the ablest liberal leader on campus.<br />\nWhy do I say that?<br />\nAccording to Dr. Hazleton Spencer,<br />\nas quoted in the NEWS-LETTER, the<br />\ntwo requirements for ,admission to<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa are scholarship and<br />\ngood moral character.<br />\nThere can be no doubt about Shils'<br />\nmeeting the scholarship test.

It is accompanied by thirty-six notebooks containing large freehand sketches of each<br />\ncrystal type, and the goniometric<br />\nmeasurements of the angles between<br />\nthe faces of each crystal.<br />\nDr. Donnay first met Dr. Ungemach, with whom he had been corresponding for some years, at Strasbourg, France, last summer, and<br />\ndiscussed with him the projected revision of Dana's \"System of Mineralogy\" to which Dr. Donnay is contributing. It was, however, their<br />\nmutual interest in the problem of<br />\nforms and the internal structure of<br />\nthe relationship between the external<br />\ncrystals\u2014and Dr. Donnay's accomplishments in this field\u2014which led Dr.<br />\nUngemach to bequeath his collection<br />\nand notebooks to Dr. Donnay.

When he returned to Baltimore, Dr. Donnay brought the mineral legacy with him. Within the<br />\nnext few years he expects to prepare and publish much of the great<br />\nvolume of valuable data contained<br />\nin the notebooks.

Thus, more than half the more<br />\nactive section of the student .body has no representation<br />\non the strike committee.<br />\nCan it be that these organizations are opposed to<br />\npeace as a principle? But, in every poll on the question<br />\nin \u2022the last few years, the Hopkins has manifested a<br />\ndeep-seated distaste for Mars and all his works.<br />\nThere is another more likely possibility. Is this<br />\napathy indicative of the feeling that, behind the strike's<br />\ninnocent exterior, subversive forces are moving? In<br />\nother words, the claim is that we who support the strike<br />\nhave been duped by agents of some foreign ideology.<br />\nThat contention is best answered by the list of organizations now represented on the committee. They are,<br />\nat last account, the Student Council, the Hullabaloo,<br />\nOmicron Delta Kappa, the NEWS-LETTER, the Debating<br />\nCouncil, -the Y.M.C.A., the Student Activities Committee,<br />\nPhi Sigma Delta, Phi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi, the Young<br />\nCommunist League, and the American Student Union.<br />\nOf these, only the last two can, \u2022by any stretch of the<br />\nimagination, be influenced by radical opinion.

The ratio is ten to two\u2014<br />\nhardly an overwhelming preponderance for \"unsafe\"<br />\nopinions.<br />\nThe truth is, of course, that the questions of war and<br />\npeace transcend political lines. Every decent citizen<br />\nhopes with all his heart to keep the world in safety.<br />\nAnd these organizations, so varied in composition, who<br />\nhave joined in the strike, have shown that they regard<br />\nthe threat of war as bigger than their minor differences.<br />\nThey have shown that they regard the fight for peace<br />\nas something more than the personal property of some<br />\nforeign peril\u2014whether it be Black, Yellow, or Red.<br /><br />\nD(<br />\nMi<br />\nFr<br />\ncoll.<br /><br />\nLETTER TO<br />\nTHE EDITOR<br />\nTo the Editor of the NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nDear Sir:<br />\nThe fact that Maurice Shils, \"seventh-ranking student in his class<br />\nand chairman of the American Student Union,\" was rejected for Phi<br />\nBeta Kappa seems to me to be significant, not so much because an injustice was done to this individual<br />\nas because this represents an apparent attempt to terrorize progressive<br />\nstudent thought and action at the<br />\nHopkins by making an object lesson<br />\nof the ablest liberal leader on campus.<br />\nWhy do I say that?<br />\nAccording to Dr. Hazleton Spencer,<br />\nas quoted in the NEWS-LETTER, the<br />\ntwo requirements for ,admission to<br />\nPhi Beta Kappa are scholarship and<br />\ngood moral character.<br />\nThere can be no doubt about Shils'<br />\nmeeting the scholarship test.

It is accompanied by thirty-six notebooks containing large freehand sketches of each<br />\ncrystal type, and the goniometric<br />\nmeasurements of the angles between<br />\nthe faces of each crystal.<br />\nDr. Donnay first met Dr. Ungemach, with whom he had been corresponding for some years, at Strasbourg, France, last summer, and<br />\ndiscussed with him the projected revision of Dana's \"System of Mineralogy\" to which Dr. Donnay is contributing. It was, however, their<br />\nmutual interest in the problem of<br />\nforms and the internal structure of<br />\nthe relationship between the external<br />\ncrystals\u2014and Dr. Donnay's accomplishments in this field\u2014which led Dr.<br />\nUngemach to bequeath his collection<br />\nand notebooks to Dr. Donnay. Although this was a personal legacy<br />\nto him, Dr. Donnay placed the material at the disposal of the Harvard<br />\nmineralogists who are working on<br />\nthe new \"Dana\" text.<br />\nDiscovers Law<br />\nLast November, Dr. Donnay, in<br />\ncollaboration with Dr. David Harker<br />\nof the Chemistry faculty, discovered<br />\na new law of crystallography correlating satisfactorily the internal<br />\nstructure and external morphology of<br />\ncrystals.<br />\nAn abstract of this discovery was<br />\npresented, last January, before a<br />\nmeeting of the Academie des Sciences<br />\nat Paris. When he returned to Baltimore, Dr. Donnay brought the mineral legacy with him. Within the<br />\nnext few years he expects to prepare and publish much of the great<br />\nvolume of valuable data contained<br />\nin the notebooks.
