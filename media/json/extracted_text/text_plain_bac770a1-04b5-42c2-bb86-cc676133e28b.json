It provides<br />\nfor a non-athletic fee to be levied<br />\nin the same manner as the present<br />\nathletic fee, and provides for a<br />\ncentral control of all of the nonathletic activities, at the same<br />\ntime taking away from these activities none of their rightful<br />\npowers. Such a plan has been<br />\nworked with great success at<br />\nmany other institutions.<br />\nThe plan is purely tentative,<br />\nand it is hoped that it will call<br />\nforth a great deal of discussion<br />\nbetween 110W and the mass-meeting. All who are interested and<br />\ndesire to suggest alterations or<br />\nadditions to the proposal are<br />\nurged to do so. As many such<br />\nsuggestions as possible, providing<br />\nthey are placed in THE NEWSLETTER box before 12 o'clock Saturday, will be published in next<br />\nweek's issue. In the same issue<br />\nthe petition as altered will be<br />\npublished.<br />\nIf passed by the student body<br />\nat the mass-meeting, the revised<br />\npetition will be presented to the<br />\nTrustees, with a request urging<br />\nthem to take action on it as soon<br />\nas possible. The petition in its<br />\ntentative form is as follows:<br />\n\"Resolved, that we, the student<br />\nbody of Johns Hopkins University, request the Board of Trustees to establish a fee of .$10 to be<br />\ndevoted to non-athletic activities,<br />\nwhich fee is to be paid by each<br />\nstudent upon entrance to the University, as is the present athletic<br />\nfee.<br />\n\"That this fee shall be turned<br />\nover to the 'Varsity Seal Voting<br />\nCouncil, to be divided among the<br />\ndifferent non-athletic activities as<br />\nit sees fit, subject to. the approval<br />\nof the chairman of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee.<br />\n\"That a uniform system of accounts for all non-athletic activities be adopted under the supervision of the 'Varsity Seal Voting<br />\nCouncil, and that these accounts<br />\nbe open at all times to inspection<br />\nby the chairman of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee and such committees as the faculty or student<br />\nbody see fit to appoint.<br />\n\"The advantages of such a system* are as follows:<br />\n-1. It insures to non-athletic<br />\nactivities the support which they<br />\nhave failed to receive in the past.<br />\n\"2. It thus enable, them to<br />\ncover a greater field than before.<br />\n\"3. It places the burden of<br />\nsupport equally on all students.<br />\n\"4.

It provides<br />\nfor a non-athletic fee to be levied<br />\nin the same manner as the present<br />\nathletic fee, and provides for a<br />\ncentral control of all of the nonathletic activities, at the same<br />\ntime taking away from these activities none of their rightful<br />\npowers. Such a plan has been<br />\nworked with great success at<br />\nmany other institutions.<br />\nThe plan is purely tentative,<br />\nand it is hoped that it will call<br />\nforth a great deal of discussion<br />\nbetween 110W and the mass-meeting. All who are interested and<br />\ndesire to suggest alterations or<br />\nadditions to the proposal are<br />\nurged to do so. As many such<br />\nsuggestions as possible, providing<br />\nthey are placed in THE NEWSLETTER box before 12 o'clock Saturday, will be published in next<br />\nweek's issue. In the same issue<br />\nthe petition as altered will be<br />\npublished.<br />\nIf passed by the student body<br />\nat the mass-meeting, the revised<br />\npetition will be presented to the<br />\nTrustees, with a request urging<br />\nthem to take action on it as soon<br />\nas possible. The petition in its<br />\ntentative form is as follows:<br />\n\"Resolved, that we, the student<br />\nbody of Johns Hopkins University, request the Board of Trustees to establish a fee of .$10 to be<br />\ndevoted to non-athletic activities,<br />\nwhich fee is to be paid by each<br />\nstudent upon entrance to the University, as is the present athletic<br />\nfee.<br />\n\"That this fee shall be turned<br />\nover to the 'Varsity Seal Voting<br />\nCouncil, to be divided among the<br />\ndifferent non-athletic activities as<br />\nit sees fit, subject to. the approval<br />\nof the chairman of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee.<br />\n\"That a uniform system of accounts for all non-athletic activities be adopted under the supervision of the 'Varsity Seal Voting<br />\nCouncil, and that these accounts<br />\nbe open at all times to inspection<br />\nby the chairman of the Student<br />\nAffairs Committee and such committees as the faculty or student<br />\nbody see fit to appoint.<br />\n\"The advantages of such a system* are as follows:<br />\n-1.
