This constitution<br />\ndates from 1978 and is currently<br />\nin effect since the referendum<br />\nwhich passed Proposal B was<br />\ninvalidated.<br />\nImpeachment<br />\nprovisions<br />\nalso differ among the three<br />\nconstitution. Proposal A stipulates that an executive or class<br />\nofficer may be impeached by a<br />\n6/7 vote of the SC of a petition<br />\nsubmitted to the SC by 25% of<br />\nthe officer's constituents. Removal occurs if a majority of<br />\nvoters favors removal.<br />\nProposal B calls for a<br />\npetition signed by 100 students<br />\nto initiate impeachment proceeding, a number which is<br />\nsmaller than Proposal A's 25%<br />\nfigure would be for most classes.<br />\nProposal B and the old constitution share a more lenient requirement for initiating impeachment proceedings \u2014 the petition<br />\nor 100 students in the case of an<br />\nexecutive officer and 75 students in the case of a class<br />\nofficer.<br />\nThe provisions for closed<br />\nmeetings also vary. Proposal A<br />\nmandates that a 6/7 vote of the<br />\nSC before an SC meeting can be<br />\nclosed. Proposal B allows for<br />\nthe most student access to SC<br />\nmeetings because it allows for<br />\nabsolutely no closed meetings.<br />\nThe old constitution's requirement for closing a meeting is a<br />\nunanimous vote of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe roles of class officers<br />\nare redefined under Proposal B.<br />\nInstead of having a class president and a class vice-president,<br />\nsecretary and treasurer, each<br />\nclass would have a class president and three class stewards.<br />\n<br />\nLerner fashioned this provision,<br />\nbecause he says distinction<br />\namong the officers' functions<br />\nbecome blurred anyway, and the<br />\nthe change in titles recognizes that fact.<br />\nProposal B would revamp<br />\nthe existing structure of the<br />\nStudent Activities Commission<br />\n(SAC). This commission now<br />\nconsists of representatives from<br />\neach SAC group, with an executitive board made up of the SC<br />\nPresident and Treasurer, the<br />\nDirector of Student Activities,<br />\nand four SAC members elected<br />\nat large from the SAC. The SAC<br />\nformulates the budget allocations for SAC groups, subject to<br />\nfinal approval by the SC.<br />\nPropoasal B removes the SC<br />\nPresident from the SAC executive board and makes it harder<br />\nfor the SAC to freeze the funds<br />\nof SAC groups. Proposal B also<br />\nrequires that any SAC allocatiun<br />\nfrom its contingency fund which<br />\nexceeds 2% of a year's tuition<br />\n(approximately $100) must be<br />\napproved by the Student Council. Proposal B would also allow<br />\nthe SC to charter a group as an<br />\nSAC group even though it has<br />\nonly two members.<br />\nCurrent SAC Executive<br />\nBoard member Greg Pecoraro<br />\nexplained his objections to this<br />\nproposed set-up for the SAC.<br />\n\"Do we giv $100 one day and<br />\n$100 the next day?

Last week the SC refused<br />\nhis request that it provide funds<br />\nso his alternative Constitution<br />\ncould be published and distributed.

His Shady Side<br />\noffice, with a view of the Bay Bridge to the<br />\nnorth, at first glance seems just a nice corporate<br />\noffice, but the tools of the researcher -- computer terminal, nautical charts, and volumes of<br />\nreports -- are all here.<br />\n\"Our research fits into three major<br />\ncategories. We have had a strong program in<br />\nphysical oceanography -- that is the study of<br />\ncurrents and structures and so forth -- and we<br />\nalso work in biological and chemical oceanography.

The second thing is the boil (or<br />\nwater temperature factor. The Hart Miller<br />\nIsland Project -- \"A large playground for adults\"<br />\n-- will be an improvement for the Bay, according<br />\nto Taylor, who cites some CBI studies which<br />\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the project.<br />\nCBI keeps a wide range of technology to<br />\ngather information. There is the obligatory fleet<br />\nof research ships, including the flagship R/V<br />\nRidgely Warfield, a 106' catamaran built specifically for CBI use. It is a massive ship, with its<br />\n1000 mile range and its capacity for 10 scientists<br />\nand 8 crew, but unfortunately, it is too massive<br />\na ship for many studies of the \u2022intricate Bay<br />\ncoast. The spirit of research holds true aboard<br />\nthe Warfield; Dr. Taylor states that \"the vessel is<br />\navailable to anybody in the University with a<br />\nNational Science Foundation Grant,\" and in<br />\nfact, the vessel is often used on joint programs<br />\n*with other bay oceanography institutes. The<br />\nD. W. Pritchard, named for a former CBI director, and another boat currently undergoing<br />\nrenovation were both once luxury motor yachts<br />\n\u2014 the boats are donated to CBI as tax shelters<br />\nand serve as excellent (and cheap) floating<br />\nlaboratories. CBI also keeps a variety of smaller,<br />\nvessels in small waterways, for use as water taxis<br />\nand as support boats to the larger ships. Inside<br />\nthe laboratories, the equipment ranges from the<br />\ncomplex to the bizarre. One machine, the \"high<br />\nturbulence tester,\" serves as a kind of liquid<br />\nwind-tunnel for testing other instruments by<br />\ncreating some very rough water in its tank.<br />\nAnother device, not really a machine, is a dye<br />\nwhich glows even in very small amounts; the<br />\n<br />\n\fdye, which was developed at the Institute, has<br />\naided pollution studies worldwide. Technology,<br />\nin fact, is usually \"played with\" until it meets a<br />\nresearcher's needs -- CBI once had an Instrument<br />\nDevelopment Division -- and researchers today<br />\noften create equipment to fill their needs if none<br />\nalready exist.<br />\nTaylor says the Institute's real challenge,<br />\ntechnological and otherwise, will be to outfit the<br />\nnew Shady Side complex. Moving out of<br />\nMacauley began early last summer and is expected to be completed early this fall, when the<br />\nbiological oceanographers move their equipment<br />\ndown. Dr. Taylor envisions the construction of<br />\nten to twelve labs (there is certainly enough<br />\nspace for them) and an expansion of the staff.<br />\nPlans for the future include the hiring of more<br />\nphysical oceanographers (a search is now underway), the possible re-establishment of an instrument development branch, and crucially \u2014<br />\nthis was stressed by everyone at the Institute -the integration of research projects with various<br />\nacademic departments at Hopkins.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Taylor, plans are being<br />\nmade not for joint programs with the School of<br />\nHygeine, and, further down the road, the<br />\nBiology Department.

The festival has brought some of<br />\nthe best current cinema to Baltimore<br />\nevery spring while its sponsor, the Film<br />\nForum, has been committed to exceptional and diverse film programs and<br />\nofferings all year round.<br />\nKenneth Moore, director of this<br />\nyear's program committee, is pleased<br />\nwitht he selections and expects another<br />\nsuccessful festival with good attendance<br />\nfor all shows.

And the prolific German director<br />\nRainer Werner Fassbinder is represented<br />\nby In a Year of Thirteen Moons which<br />\nwas hailed at the 1979 New York Film<br />\nFestival.

Viking Press, New<br />\nYork, 1979, 218 pp. $9.95)<br />\nDalton Trumbo's posthumously<br />\npublished, still unfinished novel Night<br />\nof the Aurochs recounts the Holocaust<br />\nfrom the viewpoint of Johann Grieben,<br />\nan unrepentant Nazi. Despite the brandishing of swastikas on the cover, this is<br />\nnot another World War II thriller-of-the-month. Rather it is the fictional autobiography of this century's most unsettling<br />\nthe extermination camp<br />\ncharacter:<br />\nofficer. Trumbo struggles throughout to<br />\nunearth Grieben's psychology,identifying<br />\nwith him when possible, to obtain a<br />\nbetter understanding of the mentality of<br />\nthe Holocaust.<br />\nThe aurochs of the title is a<br />\nEuropean bison considered to be extinct<br />\nby the 17th century, but which reappeared on Goering's Karinhall estate during<br />\nthe War. Trumbo felt that their resurgence during the Nazi period symbolized<br />\n<br />\nthe return of a primitivity long thought<br />\nfossilized - the barbaric Teutonic tribes<br />\nof Germany.<br />\nThe book was ambitious and quite<br />\ndisturbing for Trumbo. Perhaps he never<br />\ncould have finished it. The materials that<br />\nthe editor collected for the book, which<br />\ninclude the first ten chapters of Grieben's<br />\n\"autobiography\" (only through his<br />\nteens), Grieben's SS diary, a synopsis of<br />\nthe book told in the third person,<br />\nTrumbo's letters to his editors, and<br />\nrevealing alternate drafts and notes -together a novel-length work in themselves - bode a work of incredible size<br />\nand complexity.<br />\nAs his editor noted, Trumbo was<br />\nfinding his usual talents for satire and<br />\nirony insufficient to deal with the serious<br />\npsychological nature of the situation.<br />\nHis powerful novel Johnny Got His Gun<br />\n(1938), the story of an American soldier<br />\nwho suffers the loss of both arms and legs<br />\nas well .as his face as the result of an<br />\nexplosion during World War I -- a man<br />\nreduced to an isolated brain- that lives on<br />\n<br />\nThe SS man carried out his orders in service to the \"spiritual leader\" and state.<br />\n<br />\nTwo authors: Trumbo observes the youthful Grieben.<br />\ninterminably in a verteran's hospital was easier for Trumbo to write than<br />\nAurochs for which he had to \"become\"<br />\nthe Nazi Grieben. While the first ten<br />\nchapters are engaging reading, they are far<br />\ntoo light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek to<br />\nprepare the reader for the later intense<br />\nemotions, serious forays into history and<br />\nphilosophy, and relentless horrors to<br />\ncome. In this book Trumbo is at his best<br />\nas a thinker; he boldly and clearly<br />\nexpresses his ideas and observations in the<br />\nletters, Grieben diary, and notes.<br />\nThe main theme of Aurochs is the<br />\nrelationship between eroticism and<br />\npower. The authoritarianism of the Nazi<br />\nregime was mirrored by the husband's<br />\ndomination of his wife in the \"ideal\"<br />\nMore important to<br />\nGerman home.<br />\nGrieben than his political power is his<br />\ncontrol over women, and it is his acrual of<br />\npower through his rise in the ranks of the<br />\nSS that provides him with ever-increasing<br />\npossibilities for such domination. In<br />\naddition, Grieben asserts that the ability<br />\nto abuse is the measure of power. A<br />\nhistory of sadistic, one-sided relationships<br />\nis traced from the killing of a pet rabbit<br />\nand a childhood romance, to the keeping<br />\nof a sexual slave at Auschwitz. Along the<br />\nway, an unrequited love leads to rape.<br />\nBy bizarre contrast, Grieben, during his<br />\none repentant period following the fall of<br />\nthe Reich, longs for a woman who will<br />\nlove him without his domination. This<br />\nleads to a fantasy relationship that he<br />\nconjures between himself and the dead<br />\nAnne Frank, who he imagines he protectduring her imprisonment in<br />\ned<br />\nAuschwitz. Unfortunately, the adult<br />\nrelationships were never written outside<br />\nof the synopsis. They would have taxed<br />\n<br />\nthe powers of the author (and probably<br />\nany writer) to the extreme.<br />\nWhen Trumbo criticizes this abusive eroticism, he is not moralizing. He<br />\nonly wants to point out the twisted<br />\ndevelopment of sexuality in a morally<br />\nrepressive and sexually unequal society.<br />\nIn fact, he cites the strict morality of<br />\nGerman culture as instrumental in the<br />\nappeal of Nazism. \"(Grieben)committed<br />\n(these atrocities) for a high purpose, a<br />\nshining cause. He was, therefore, by<br />\ndefinition a hero. Even a moral hero.\"<br />\nJust as \"Abraham was prepared to kill<br />\nIsaac, his son,in fulfillment of his duty to,<br />\nand his love of, God,\" the SS man<br />\ncarried out orders painful to the victim<br />\nand oppressor alike in service to the<br />\n\"spiritual\" leader and state.<br />\nSeeing the workings of Trumbo's<br />\nmind at such a difficult task is an important aspect of this unfinished work. We<br />\ncan follow him as he makes decisions on<br />\nstylistic devices and methods of presenting the synopsized material; for<br />\nexample, diary entries reveal the aged<br />\nmemoirist's thoughts at an earlier age.<br />\nAurochs may well have been the<br />\nunfinishable novel, but it is exactly for<br />\nthat reason that it deserves to be read: it<br />\nis a multi-layered novel about the process<br />\nof writing a chronicle of the Nazi experience. The editors note how Trumbo<br />\ngave his character the same terminal<br />\nillness that he was suffering from (and<br />\nfinally died from), thereby closing the<br />\ngap between reality and fiction. The two<br />\nwriters are then on an equal level - they<br />\nwill finish together, or not at all. Trumbo<br />\nand Grieben work both for and against<br />\neach other to tell the story that neither ,<br />\ncan come to terms with.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 11<br />\n<br />\nOptimistic Drama<br />\n<br />\nSouthern Crimes: A Shared Moment<br />\nBY ROSALIND RESNICK<br />\nCrimes of the Heart, playing at<br />\nCenter Stage until May 25, is, by playwright Beth Henley's admission, a Southern play. The ingredients of the play<br />\nwould tend to create an atmosphere of<br />\nnostalgic melancholy reminiscent of<br />\nmuch southern drama. The entire drama<br />\ntakes place in the Magraths' kitchen<br />\nin Hazelhurst, Mississippi. The main<br />\ncharacters are three grown-up sisters,<br />\nwith resentments deeply rooted in the<br />\npast, brought together in the present by<br />\na tragedy. There's even an annoying<br />\nneighbor and the invisible presence of<br />\nOld Granddad. What more could any<br />\nplay need to assure a melancholy ending?<br />\nQuite a lot more, it would seem.<br />\nFor Crimes of the Heart, contrary to<br />\nexpectation, is an up-beat play, one<br />\n<br />\nwhose humor is not always bitter and<br />\nwhich ends on a note of hope. Brought<br />\ntogether by the youngest sister's shooting<br />\nof her husband, the three women manage<br />\nto resolve their grievances against one<br />\nanother and to unite in love.<br />\nFortunately, playwright Henley's<br />\nskill as a dramatist precludes any moralizing or heavy-handedness. The action<br />\nflows smoothly, and the main characters<br />\ndo not lapse into stereotypes. The<br />\nstructure of the play fires off a series of<br />\nshort incidents and conversations, which<br />\ninfrequently converge to bring the<br />\nthree sisters together in a shared laugh or<br />\nIts spontaneity and warmth<br />\nsmile.<br />\nmake Crimes of the Heart similar in tone<br />\nto You Can't Take It With You.<br />\nThe division of the leading role<br />\namong three actors makes Crimes of<br />\nthe Heart an es\u2022ecially good choice for a<br />\n<br />\nrepertory theater like Center Stage.<br />\nAnd, luckily, the script itself leaves<br />\nconsiderable room for the actors to<br />\ninterpret their characters.<br />\nBarbara<br />\neda-Young, as Lenny, the oldest sister<br />\nwho fears that men will reject her because<br />\nof her \"shrunken ovary,\" is frequently<br />\nsulky and depressed. But underneath she<br />\nclings to hope on such apparent trivialities as a wish on a birthday candle posed<br />\nfragilly on a crumbling cookie. Ellen<br />\nParker plays Meg, the middle sister who<br />\nhas a promising \"singing career\" and<br />\nmore than her share of men. She acts like<br />\nanother Linda Ronstadt - bruised and<br />\ncynical, but with a heart of gold underneath. Sally Sockwell, as Babe, the young.<br />\nest sister and would-be killer, is actually<br />\nconsiderate in her own eccentric way she wants nothing more than to be left<br />\nalone to play the saxophone. In short,<br />\nany one of the sisters could have been<br />\nturned into a tragic heroine. But none of<br />\nthem is; their personalities, though rooted<br />\n<br />\nin a dismal past, are too human, too.<br />\nbuoyant to be depressed for long.<br />\nThe other characters,some stereotypes and some not, are all excellently<br />\ndone. Jane Galloway (Chick) gives a<br />\nhillarious parody of the goody-two-shoes,<br />\nLadies League, obnoxious neighbor; she is<br />\nso annoying, in fact, that the audience<br />\nactually applauded when Lenny chases<br />\nher offstage with a broom! Justin Deas<br />\n(Barnette) gives a sympathetic protrayal<br />\nof the absent-minded, idealistic young<br />\nlawyer out to win Babe's heart and<br />\npursue his \"personal vendetta\" against<br />\nher husband.<br />\nAll things considered, the marvelous thing about Beth Henley's Crimes<br />\nof the Heart is its optimism. By the end<br />\nof the play, little actual improvement<br />\nhas come into the sisters' lives, but there<br />\nis one added element that has brightened<br />\ntheir spirits - the shared moments of<br />\nlove.<br />\n<br />\nThe FinestIn Film<br />\n<br />\n14<br />\n<br />\na .4<br />\n<br />\nBrought together by a shooting, three women manage to unite in love.<br />\n<br />\ncontfrom p. 10<br />\nRobert M.

May 11.<br />\nDexter Gordon is a giant of the<br />\ntenor saxophone, both literally (he's<br />\n6'5\") and figuratively.

He quit school at<br />\nseventeen and began his apprenticeship in<br />\nthe big bands of Hampton, Fletcher<br />\nHenderson, Louis Armstrong, and Billy<br />\nEckstine. In the late forties he played in<br />\nvarious small groups with Charlie Parker,<br />\nDizzy Gillespie, Ben Webster, and Kenny<br />\nClarke. In 1947 he and Wardell Gray<br />\nmade a historic contribution to the<br />\ntradition of the \"tenor battle\" with<br />\n\"The Chase.\" The fifties were a dark<br />\ntime for Gordon. \"Cool jazz\" was in, and<br />\nthere was not much interest from the<br />\n<br />\nYou or No One,\" a poignant and searching \"Round Midnight,\" and Dexter's<br />\nblues \"Backstairs,\" complete with the<br />\nobligatory quote from \"Here Comes the<br />\nBride.\" Dexter followed this masterful<br />\nperformance with two bits of fluff,<br />\n\"Sophisticated Giant\" and \"Manhattan<br />\nSymphonie.\" The first is partly redeemed by Slide Hampton's arrangements, the<br />\nsecond merely a catalog of Dexter's pet<br />\nphrases.

This constitution<br />\ndates from 1978 and is currently<br />\nin effect since the referendum<br />\nwhich passed Proposal B was<br />\ninvalidated.<br />\nImpeachment<br />\nprovisions<br />\nalso differ among the three<br />\nconstitution. Proposal A stipulates that an executive or class<br />\nofficer may be impeached by a<br />\n6/7 vote of the SC of a petition<br />\nsubmitted to the SC by 25% of<br />\nthe officer's constituents. Removal occurs if a majority of<br />\nvoters favors removal.<br />\nProposal B calls for a<br />\npetition signed by 100 students<br />\nto initiate impeachment proceeding, a number which is<br />\nsmaller than Proposal A's 25%<br />\nfigure would be for most classes.<br />\nProposal B and the old constitution share a more lenient requirement for initiating impeachment proceedings \u2014 the petition<br />\nor 100 students in the case of an<br />\nexecutive officer and 75 students in the case of a class<br />\nofficer.<br />\nThe provisions for closed<br />\nmeetings also vary. Proposal A<br />\nmandates that a 6/7 vote of the<br />\nSC before an SC meeting can be<br />\nclosed. Proposal B allows for<br />\nthe most student access to SC<br />\nmeetings because it allows for<br />\nabsolutely no closed meetings.<br />\nThe old constitution's requirement for closing a meeting is a<br />\nunanimous vote of the Student<br />\nCouncil.<br />\nThe roles of class officers<br />\nare redefined under Proposal B.<br />\nInstead of having a class president and a class vice-president,<br />\nsecretary and treasurer, each<br />\nclass would have a class president and three class stewards.<br /><br />\nLerner fashioned this provision,<br />\nbecause he says distinction<br />\namong the officers' functions<br />\nbecome blurred anyway, and the<br />\nthe change in titles recognizes that fact.<br />\nProposal B would revamp<br />\nthe existing structure of the<br />\nStudent Activities Commission<br />\n(SAC). This commission now<br />\nconsists of representatives from<br />\neach SAC group, with an executitive board made up of the SC<br />\nPresident and Treasurer, the<br />\nDirector of Student Activities,<br />\nand four SAC members elected<br />\nat large from the SAC. The SAC<br />\nformulates the budget allocations for SAC groups, subject to<br />\nfinal approval by the SC.<br />\nPropoasal B removes the SC<br />\nPresident from the SAC executive board and makes it harder<br />\nfor the SAC to freeze the funds<br />\nof SAC groups. Proposal B also<br />\nrequires that any SAC allocatiun<br />\nfrom its contingency fund which<br />\nexceeds 2% of a year's tuition<br />\n(approximately $100) must be<br />\napproved by the Student Council. Proposal B would also allow<br />\nthe SC to charter a group as an<br />\nSAC group even though it has<br />\nonly two members.<br />\nCurrent SAC Executive<br />\nBoard member Greg Pecoraro<br />\nexplained his objections to this<br />\nproposed set-up for the SAC.<br />\n\"Do we giv $100 one day and<br />\n$100 the next day? We could<br />\nplay those games, but they're<br />\npointless,\" he said, referring to<br />\nthe 2% spending limitation. As for<br />\nthe provision whereby a mere<br />\ntwo students can become and<br />\nSAC group, Pecoraro said,\"Any<br />\ntwo students have the right to<br />\nform a group. The number<br />\nwe've been using is basically 15.<br />\nTo take a ridiculous example<br />\nthat illustrates the point, my<br /><br />\nHair Cutting &amp; Design<br />\nFor Men &amp; Women<br /><br />\ngirlfriend and I could form the body at the discretion of the<br />\nDinner Club and get a budget Student Council,\" said Lerner.<br />\nand go sample restaurants.\" As \"SAC status only entitles a<br />\nfor closed meetings, Pecoraro group to the use of the Universisaid, \"I think that both the ty's name and meeting room.\"<br />\nCouncil and the (SAC) ExecuThe future of the three<br />\ntive Board should be able to do versions of the constitution is<br />\nso (closed meetings) on a currently uncertain.

Also, the author<br />\nshould have noted that the<br />\nStudent Constitution provides<br />\nthat \"no individual may have<br />\nmore than one vote on the<br />\nSAC.\" Since the Executive<br />\nBoard permitted at least one<br />\nperson to vote for two groups,<br />\nthe official tally of votes<br />\nindicates that there was no<br />\nquorum present to ratify the<br />\nSAC budget.<br /><br />\nNew Council Debates Rejection<br />\nOf Constitutional Referendum<br />\ncont. from p. I<br />\nmade by the previous Council,<br />\nand there was no precedent in<br />\nprevious Council action. Steele<br />\nobserved that Parliamentary<br />\ntradition seemed to show that<br />\nnew sessions did not reverse<br />\ndecisions made during the previous session. Outgoing Student<br />\nCouncil<br />\nPresident<br />\nGeorge<br />\nConnolly spoke to the new<br />\nCouncil and said that he thought<br />\nit was not possible for the new<br />\nsession to reverse the decision of<br />\nthe old Council, and that trying<br />\nwas a bad idea.<br />\nCaloir suggested that the<br />\nnew Council pass a motion that<br />\nrevalidated the referendum on<br />\nthe priviso that it turned out<br />\nthat the body had the power to<br />\ndo so. Pecoraro interjected that<br />\nit was the \"Council itself\"<br />\nthat has to decide what it has<br />\nthe right to do. He said that<br />\n\"we can't call the people\" right<br /><br />\nnow to decide what is in the<br />\nConstitution.<br />\nThere was considerable<br />\ndebate on where an answer<br />\ncould be found on the extent of<br />\nthe Council's powers to reverse a<br />\ndecision. There were no references in the old Constitution,<br />\nunder which the new Council<br />\nwas operating.<br />\nThere was'<br />\nalso discussion about whether<br />\n\"Robert's Rules of Order\" were<br />\nused by the Council or not.<br />\nThe Constitution said simply that the Council would set the<br />\nRules of Order, but it was also<br />\nthe consensus that Robert's<br />\nRules were the base of Council<br />\nprocedures.<br />\nEventually, a vote was taken<br />\non Pecoraro's motion about the<br />\nsense of the Council. It passed<br />\neight to nothing, with three<br />\nabstentions.<br />\nThe taking of<br />\nthe vote ended debate on the<br />\nbroader question of Council<br /><br />\nauthority.<br />\nPecoraro then made a<br />\nmotion that a committee be<br />\nappointed to draft standing<br />\nrules for the Student Council,<br />\nwhich was passed unanimously.<br />\nAt the meeting it was<br />\npointed out that according to<br />\nRobert's Rules the old Council<br />\nwould have had to give notice at<br />\none meeting that it would<br />\nconsider at the next meeting<br />\nwhether to invalidate a vote.<br />\nThis was dismissed when it was<br />\ndecided that the Council did not<br />\nstrictly adhere to Robert's<br />\nRules.<br />\nIn its final action before<br />\nadjournment the new Council<br />\ndecided in favor of a motion,<br />\n\"to support the Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity Band in their search<br />\nfor moneys.\" This contradicts<br />\nanother action of the old Council which had drastically cut the<br />\nband's funding.<br /><br />\n1\u2022\u2022\u2018<br />\n\u20224N,\u202241\\\u2022-4.4\u2022\\44.4\\4\u2022-\u2022\\\u2022\u2022\u2022*<br />\n\\<br />\nSENIORS!!!<br /><br />\n100 E. 33rd St. I BLOCK FROM CAMPUS<br />\nFor Appointment Tues - Sat - Call<br />\n235-7083<br />\nSpecial Student Rate - with I.D.<br /><br />\nNEED GLASSES?<br /><br />\nCheck your boxes Monday<br />\nfor tickets to<br /><br />\nGraduation Activities<br />\n(Port Welcome and Picnic)<br />\nand an<br /><br />\nIMPORTANT LETTER<br />\nconcerning what the class has<br />\nplanned to celebrate<br />\nROTUNDA OPTICIANS<br />\nRotunda Mall<br /><br />\nPrescriptions Filled<br /><br />\n467-7727<br /><br />\nGRADUATION.<br /><br />\nPAGE 4 / MAY 2, 1980<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins<br /><br />\nAre<br />\nWe<br />\nBetrayed<br />\nNews-Letter<br />\nWe are the Hollow Men.

His Shady Side<br />\noffice, with a view of the Bay Bridge to the<br />\nnorth, at first glance seems just a nice corporate<br />\noffice, but the tools of the researcher -- computer terminal, nautical charts, and volumes of<br />\nreports -- are all here.<br />\n\"Our research fits into three major<br />\ncategories.

The second thing is the boil (or<br />\nwater temperature factor. The Hart Miller<br />\nIsland Project -- \"A large playground for adults\"<br />\n-- will be an improvement for the Bay, according<br />\nto Taylor, who cites some CBI studies which<br />\ndemonstrated the feasibility of the project.<br />\nCBI keeps a wide range of technology to<br />\ngather information. There is the obligatory fleet<br />\nof research ships, including the flagship R/V<br />\nRidgely Warfield, a 106' catamaran built specifically for CBI use. It is a massive ship, with its<br />\n1000 mile range and its capacity for 10 scientists<br />\nand 8 crew, but unfortunately, it is too massive<br />\na ship for many studies of the \u2022intricate Bay<br />\ncoast. The spirit of research holds true aboard<br />\nthe Warfield; Dr. Taylor states that \"the vessel is<br />\navailable to anybody in the University with a<br />\nNational Science Foundation Grant,\" and in<br />\nfact, the vessel is often used on joint programs<br />\n*with other bay oceanography institutes. The<br />\nD. W. Pritchard, named for a former CBI director, and another boat currently undergoing<br />\nrenovation were both once luxury motor yachts<br />\n\u2014 the boats are donated to CBI as tax shelters<br />\nand serve as excellent (and cheap) floating<br />\nlaboratories. CBI also keeps a variety of smaller,<br />\nvessels in small waterways, for use as water taxis<br />\nand as support boats to the larger ships. Inside<br />\nthe laboratories, the equipment ranges from the<br />\ncomplex to the bizarre. One machine, the \"high<br />\nturbulence tester,\" serves as a kind of liquid<br />\nwind-tunnel for testing other instruments by<br />\ncreating some very rough water in its tank.<br />\nAnother device, not really a machine, is a dye<br />\nwhich glows even in very small amounts; the<br /><br />\ndye, which was developed at the Institute, has<br />\naided pollution studies worldwide. Technology,<br />\nin fact, is usually \"played with\" until it meets a<br />\nresearcher's needs -- CBI once had an Instrument<br />\nDevelopment Division -- and researchers today<br />\noften create equipment to fill their needs if none<br />\nalready exist.<br />\nTaylor says the Institute's real challenge,<br />\ntechnological and otherwise, will be to outfit the<br />\nnew Shady Side complex. Moving out of<br />\nMacauley began early last summer and is expected to be completed early this fall, when the<br />\nbiological oceanographers move their equipment<br />\ndown. Dr. Taylor envisions the construction of<br />\nten to twelve labs (there is certainly enough<br />\nspace for them) and an expansion of the staff.<br />\nPlans for the future include the hiring of more<br />\nphysical oceanographers (a search is now underway), the possible re-establishment of an instrument development branch, and crucially \u2014<br />\nthis was stressed by everyone at the Institute -the integration of research projects with various<br />\nacademic departments at Hopkins.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Taylor, plans are being<br />\nmade not for joint programs with the School of<br />\nHygeine, and, further down the road, the<br />\nBiology Department.

In this book Trumbo is at his best<br />\nas a thinker; he boldly and clearly<br />\nexpresses his ideas and observations in the<br />\nletters, Grieben diary, and notes.<br />\nThe main theme of Aurochs is the<br />\nrelationship between eroticism and<br />\npower.

In<br />\naddition, Grieben asserts that the ability<br />\nto abuse is the measure of power. A<br />\nhistory of sadistic, one-sided relationships<br />\nis traced from the killing of a pet rabbit<br />\nand a childhood romance, to the keeping<br />\nof a sexual slave at Auschwitz. Along the<br />\nway, an unrequited love leads to rape.<br />\nBy bizarre contrast, Grieben, during his<br />\none repentant period following the fall of<br />\nthe Reich, longs for a woman who will<br />\nlove him without his domination. This<br />\nleads to a fantasy relationship that he<br />\nconjures between himself and the dead<br />\nAnne Frank, who he imagines he protectduring her imprisonment in<br />\ned<br />\nAuschwitz. Unfortunately, the adult<br />\nrelationships were never written outside<br />\nof the synopsis.

He<br />\nonly wants to point out the twisted<br />\ndevelopment of sexuality in a morally<br />\nrepressive and sexually unequal society.<br />\nIn fact, he cites the strict morality of<br />\nGerman culture as instrumental in the<br />\nappeal of Nazism. \"(Grieben)committed<br />\n(these atrocities) for a high purpose, a<br />\nshining cause.

We<br />\ncan follow him as he makes decisions on<br />\nstylistic devices and methods of presenting the synopsized material; for<br />\nexample, diary entries reveal the aged<br />\nmemoirist's thoughts at an earlier age.<br />\nAurochs may well have been the<br />\nunfinishable novel, but it is exactly for<br />\nthat reason that it deserves to be read: it<br />\nis a multi-layered novel about the process<br />\nof writing a chronicle of the Nazi experience. The editors note how Trumbo<br />\ngave his character the same terminal<br />\nillness that he was suffering from (and<br />\nfinally died from), thereby closing the<br />\ngap between reality and fiction. The two<br />\nwriters are then on an equal level - they<br />\nwill finish together, or not at all.

The ingredients of the play<br />\nwould tend to create an atmosphere of<br />\nnostalgic melancholy reminiscent of<br />\nmuch southern drama. The entire drama<br />\ntakes place in the Magraths' kitchen<br />\nin Hazelhurst, Mississippi.

The<br />\nstructure of the play fires off a series of<br />\nshort incidents and conversations, which<br />\ninfrequently converge to bring the<br />\nthree sisters together in a shared laugh or<br />\nIts spontaneity and warmth<br />\nsmile.<br />\nmake Crimes of the Heart similar in tone<br />\nto You Can't Take It With You.<br />\nThe division of the leading role<br />\namong three actors makes Crimes of<br />\nthe Heart an es\u2022ecially good choice for a<br /><br />\nrepertory theater like Center Stage.<br />\nAnd, luckily, the script itself leaves<br />\nconsiderable room for the actors to<br />\ninterpret their characters.<br />\nBarbara<br />\neda-Young, as Lenny, the oldest sister<br />\nwho fears that men will reject her because<br />\nof her \"shrunken ovary,\" is frequently<br />\nsulky and depressed. But underneath she<br />\nclings to hope on such apparent trivialities as a wish on a birthday candle posed<br />\nfragilly on a crumbling cookie. Ellen<br />\nParker plays Meg, the middle sister who<br />\nhas a promising \"singing career\" and<br />\nmore than her share of men. She acts like<br />\nanother Linda Ronstadt - bruised and<br />\ncynical, but with a heart of gold underneath. Sally Sockwell, as Babe, the young.<br />\nest sister and would-be killer, is actually<br />\nconsiderate in her own eccentric way she wants nothing more than to be left<br />\nalone to play the saxophone. In short,<br />\nany one of the sisters could have been<br />\nturned into a tragic heroine. But none of<br />\nthem is; their personalities, though rooted<br /><br />\nin a dismal past, are too human, too.<br />\nbuoyant to be depressed for long.<br />\nThe other characters,some stereotypes and some not, are all excellently<br />\ndone. Jane Galloway (Chick) gives a<br />\nhillarious parody of the goody-two-shoes,<br />\nLadies League, obnoxious neighbor; she is<br />\nso annoying, in fact, that the audience<br />\nactually applauded when Lenny chases<br />\nher offstage with a broom! Justin Deas<br />\n(Barnette) gives a sympathetic protrayal<br />\nof the absent-minded, idealistic young<br />\nlawyer out to win Babe's heart and<br />\npursue his \"personal vendetta\" against<br />\nher husband.<br />\nAll things considered, the marvelous thing about Beth Henley's Crimes<br />\nof the Heart is its optimism. By the end<br />\nof the play, little actual improvement<br />\nhas come into the sisters' lives, but there<br />\nis one added element that has brightened<br />\ntheir spirits - the shared moments of<br />\nlove.<br /><br />\nThe FinestIn Film<br /><br />\n14<br /><br />\na .4<br /><br />\nBrought together by a shooting, three women manage to unite in love.<br /><br />\ncontfrom p. 10<br />\nRobert M.

He quit school at<br />\nseventeen and began his apprenticeship in<br />\nthe big bands of Hampton, Fletcher<br />\nHenderson, Louis Armstrong, and Billy<br />\nEckstine. In the late forties he played in<br />\nvarious small groups with Charlie Parker,<br />\nDizzy Gillespie, Ben Webster, and Kenny<br />\nClarke. In 1947 he and Wardell Gray<br />\nmade a historic contribution to the<br />\ntradition of the \"tenor battle\" with<br />\n\"The Chase.\" The fifties were a dark<br />\ntime for Gordon. \"Cool jazz\" was in, and<br />\nthere was not much interest from the<br /><br />\nYou or No One,\" a poignant and searching \"Round Midnight,\" and Dexter's<br />\nblues \"Backstairs,\" complete with the<br />\nobligatory quote from \"Here Comes the<br />\nBride.\" Dexter followed this masterful<br />\nperformance with two bits of fluff,<br />\n\"Sophisticated Giant\" and \"Manhattan<br />\nSymphonie.\" The first is partly redeemed by Slide Hampton's arrangements, the<br />\nsecond merely a catalog of Dexter's pet<br />\nphrases.

JOHNSON<br />\nThe<br />\nconsensus, iamong<br />\nsportswriters and the Orioles<br />\nthemselves, is that the setback<br />\nwon't last. Hitters such as Ken<br />\nSingleton, Gary Roenicke, Lee<br />\nMay, and John Lowenstein are<br />\nexpected to improve any day.<br />\nCurrently only centerfielder Al<br />\nBumbry is having any success<br />\nwith the bat. He's hitting .300.<br />\nDennis Martinez, after a miserable start against Chicago, is<br />\ngetting better on the mound and<br />\nseems to have overcome his<br />\nmuscle injury. But it will take<br />\nimprovement across the board<br />\nbefore the Orioles begin to look<br />\nAfter the first month of<br />\nbaseball, the American League<br />\nChampion Baltimore Orioles are<br />\nplaying like anything but champions. Never known for their<br />\nskill with the bat, the current<br />\nBirds have hit a new low in team<br />\nbatting average (.201). Multiple<br />\npitching problems have increased<br />\nthe Oriole difficulties, with two<br />\nstarters experiencing arm injuries.<br />\nAn unimpressive 7-11<br />\nrecord, with eight losses out of<br />\nthe last ten, hardly seems an<br />\nappropriate start for last year's<br />\n100-plus games winners.<br /><br />\nIMP<br /><br />\nlike they did last year.<br />\nOne particularly weak spot<br />\nfor the Birds is the way the<br />\ninfielders are hitting. Usually<br />\nonly Mark Belanger hits under<br />\n.200, but he has been joined<br />\nlately by Floyd Rayford (.125),<br />\nKiko Garcia (.148), and Rich<br />\nEven Doug<br />\nDauer (.160).<br />\nDecinces (.230) could be doing<br />\nmuch better. Bullpen execution<br /><br />\nstaff, followed Tuesday night's<br />\n4-3 loss to the New York Yankees. Reshuffling of different<br />\nsorts was discussed, but the<br />\nimpulse is to not make any<br />\nimmediate changes. Weaver's<br />\nteam is nearly man-for-man the<br />\nsame squad that won 102 games<br />\njust last year, and he seems<br />\nunwilling to tamper with<br />\nsuccess.<br />\nFortunately, Earl may not<br />\nhave to do anything drastic in<br />\nthe near future. Though the<br />\nOrioles chart in at fifth place in<br />\nthe American League East standings, the Toronto Blue Jays<br />\ncurrently hold first. The Jays<br />\nsurprised everyone by going 5-0<br />\nagainst the Milwaukee Brewers<br />\nand racking up a record of 9-6.<br />\nThere is little doubt that the<br />\nAdmission : $2.00<br />\nOrioles will improve. April was<br />\n($1.50 w/ MU student<br />\nnot their best month in 1979.<br />\nThe question remains: to what dowiwwwww.<br />\nextent will the Birds be able to<br />\nimprove their always-low team<br />\nbatting average? Perhaps Earl<br />\nWeaver will consider trading one<br />\nof his pitchers, or even an<br />\ninfielder, for a consistent .300<br />\nhitter.
