Allan Knight<br />\nChalmers at the third meeting of the<br />\nUniversity Supper Club Tuesday<br />\nevening.<br />\nMan has throughout the ages had<br />\nan inferiority complex that leads<br />\nhim to belittle himself in the presence of seemingly powerful forces<br />\nwhich dominate his life, he declared,<br />\nand today this complex gives expression in the question, \"How can<br />\nI help -doing what I do? I am not<br />\nresponsible.\" The psychologists of<br />\ntoday are largely responsible for<br />\nthis line of thinking, according to<br />\nDr. Chalmers, when they teach us<br />\nthat it is heredity and environment<br />\nwhich makes individuals what they<br />\nare.<br />\nThe spirit of the age is well expressed, continued the speaker, by<br />\nthe mechanical man, Erich Robot,<br />\nrecently created and which he had<br />\na chance to interview. The robot,<br />\nas long as it is asked a fixed set of<br />\nquestions, knows the answers, but<br />\nwhen Dr. Chalmers asked it what<br />\nwould happen to the working men<br />\nwhich it would replace, it replied<br />\nin a flat, mechanical voice, \"I don't<br />\nknow.\"<br />\nIt is only by expressing individualism, he averred, that this \"r<br />\ndon't know and care\" attitude can<br />\nbe overcome, for the fate qf the<br />\nworld today is in the hands of each<br />\nindividual. Pacifists are examples<br />\nof this \"individualism with a difference.\" It requires fighting and<br />\nsticking powers uncommon in the<br />\nrace, to stand up before an inflamed<br />\nmob as did \u00b7 Jeremiah in the wartime play depicting the people askh1g. to be sent to war by their king.<br />\nSocialism is a denial of individualism and is often held today by<br />\nthe man who \"won't let anyone tell<br />\nhim what to do,\" but is immediately<br />\nafterward seen in his car, waiting<br />\nfor a red light to turn green, with<br />\nno traffic coming either way, said<br />\nDr. Chalmers. It is these men who<br />\nstill think freedom is, as it is so<br />\nably expressed in Untermeyer's<br />\nMoses, \"the refusal to obey.\"<br />\nThe picture of Gandhi, walking<br />\nthe streets of London forty years<br />\nago, arrayed in \"tall silk hat, spats<br />\nand a cane, corning home from a<br />\ndancing lesson,\" while today he<br />\nwalks the same streets with the fate<br />\nof India in his hands, was used by<br />\nthe Supper Club speaker as an illustration of a man who dared to be<br />\ndifferent in a big way.<br />\nIn his concluding remarks, he<br />\nstated that those who have to be<br />\npushed won't transform the world,<br />\nbut rather, those who have ability<br />\nto see for themselves. Galileo,<br />\nN ewtoa, and Wesley did not have<br />\nto be tapped on the back to be given<br />\ntheir message, but went out '1ooking for it.<br />\nIn a luncheon gathering at 12 :30,<br />\nDr. Chalmers discussed the subject<br />\nof beliefs and whether or not they<br />\nmattered.

There are many who are<br />\njust fresh from schools where stringent rules governing examinations<br />\nwere in force, and naturally when<br />\nthey came to Hopkins and found<br />\nthat there were no such rules, but<br />\nthat we had an \"IIonor System\"they were somewhat at a loss as to<br />\nwhat it was all about.<br />\nThere are two methods of regulating\u00b7 examinations, open to every<br />\nschool and university. The first<br />\none, and by far the more often<br />\nused, is the method where those<br />\ntaking the examination are put under the direct surveillance of some<br />\nteacher or instructor. The other<br />\nmethod that is used is the one that<br />\nis in vogue at the Hopkins; a man<br />\nis placed on his \"honor\" to do his<br />\n\"own\" work at all times. After<br />\ngoing over the examination papers<br />\nand making the necessary explanations, the professor or instructor<br />\nwill retire to some secluded spot<br />\nand leave the students free to do as<br />\nthey choose. This action must not<br />\nbe misconstrued. His departure is<br />\nnot a signal for open discussion of<br />\nthe questions by small groups of<br />\nstudents, and the freedom given to<br />\nthe students should not be misused<br />\nin this way. No license is given to<br />\nanyone to discuss any points of the<br />\nexamination with any of his fellow<br />\nstudents. No so-called \"huddle<br />\nsystems\" should be used. If the<br />\nquestions are not self-explanatory<br />\nand doubt as to their meaning is<br />\nraised in the mind of a student, he<br />\nshould seek an adequate explanation from the instructor and not<br />\nfrom the fellow sitting next to him.<br />\nDuring examination time, it may<br />\nseem strange to some to see students walking out of the examination rooms with the questions in<br />\ntheir hands and seeking out secluded spots where they can work<br />\nout the problems in privacy and<br />\nwhere peace and quiet reign. Under the existing system, every student is privileged to take his examination wherever he so chooses.<br />\nVvhen a student turns in his paper<br />\nat the end of the period and signs<br />\nhis name to the pledge, that signifies to the professor that all the<br />\nwork contained between the blue<br />\ncovers of the book is a result of the<br />\n<br />\n---o-<br />\n<br />\nDr. J.

K. Chalmers, Noted<br />\nPacifist Preacher, Addresses<br />\nSupper Club<br />\nINDIVIDUALISM HAS<br />\nPURPOSE, SAID<br />\nCalls Socialism A Denial Of<br />\nEssentially Necessary<br />\nIndividualism<br />\nEach individual is responsible for<br />\nthe world as it exists today, it was<br />\nasserted by Rev. Allan Knight<br />\nChalmers at the third meeting of the<br />\nUniversity Supper Club Tuesday<br />\nevening.<br />\nMan has throughout the ages had<br />\nan inferiority complex that leads<br />\nhim to belittle himself in the presence of seemingly powerful forces<br />\nwhich dominate his life, he declared,<br />\nand today this complex gives expression in the question, \"How can<br />\nI help -doing what I do? I am not<br />\nresponsible.\" The psychologists of<br />\ntoday are largely responsible for<br />\nthis line of thinking, according to<br />\nDr. Chalmers, when they teach us<br />\nthat it is heredity and environment<br />\nwhich makes individuals what they<br />\nare.<br />\nThe spirit of the age is well expressed, continued the speaker, by<br />\nthe mechanical man, Erich Robot,<br />\nrecently created and which he had<br />\na chance to interview. The robot,<br />\nas long as it is asked a fixed set of<br />\nquestions, knows the answers, but<br />\nwhen Dr. Chalmers asked it what<br />\nwould happen to the working men<br />\nwhich it would replace, it replied<br />\nin a flat, mechanical voice, \"I don't<br />\nknow.\"<br />\nIt is only by expressing individualism, he averred, that this \"r<br />\ndon't know and care\" attitude can<br />\nbe overcome, for the fate qf the<br />\nworld today is in the hands of each<br />\nindividual. Pacifists are examples<br />\nof this \"individualism with a difference.\" It requires fighting and<br />\nsticking powers uncommon in the<br />\nrace, to stand up before an inflamed<br />\nmob as did \u00b7 Jeremiah in the wartime play depicting the people askh1g. to be sent to war by their king.<br />\nSocialism is a denial of individualism and is often held today by<br />\nthe man who \"won't let anyone tell<br />\nhim what to do,\" but is immediately<br />\nafterward seen in his car, waiting<br />\nfor a red light to turn green, with<br />\nno traffic coming either way, said<br />\nDr. Chalmers. It is these men who<br />\nstill think freedom is, as it is so<br />\nably expressed in Untermeyer's<br />\nMoses, \"the refusal to obey.\"<br />\nThe picture of Gandhi, walking<br />\nthe streets of London forty years<br />\nago, arrayed in \"tall silk hat, spats<br />\nand a cane, corning home from a<br />\ndancing lesson,\" while today he<br />\nwalks the same streets with the fate<br />\nof India in his hands, was used by<br />\nthe Supper Club speaker as an illustration of a man who dared to be<br />\ndifferent in a big way.<br />\nIn his concluding remarks, he<br />\nstated that those who have to be<br />\npushed won't transform the world,<br />\nbut rather, those who have ability<br />\nto see for themselves. Galileo,<br />\nN ewtoa, and Wesley did not have<br />\nto be tapped on the back to be given<br />\ntheir message, but went out '1ooking for it.<br />\nIn a luncheon gathering at 12 :30,<br />\nDr. Chalmers discussed the subject<br />\nof beliefs and whether or not they<br />\nmattered. In his opinion, beliefs<br />\nmake a man what he is. Further( Continued on page 2, column 3)<br /><br />\nRoosevelt-For-President<br />\nClub Founded At Harvard Law School<br />\nBoston, Dec. 10 (N.

There are many who are<br />\njust fresh from schools where stringent rules governing examinations<br />\nwere in force, and naturally when<br />\nthey came to Hopkins and found<br />\nthat there were no such rules, but<br />\nthat we had an \"IIonor System\"they were somewhat at a loss as to<br />\nwhat it was all about.<br />\nThere are two methods of regulating\u00b7 examinations, open to every<br />\nschool and university. The first<br />\none, and by far the more often<br />\nused, is the method where those<br />\ntaking the examination are put under the direct surveillance of some<br />\nteacher or instructor. The other<br />\nmethod that is used is the one that<br />\nis in vogue at the Hopkins; a man<br />\nis placed on his \"honor\" to do his<br />\n\"own\" work at all times. After<br />\ngoing over the examination papers<br />\nand making the necessary explanations, the professor or instructor<br />\nwill retire to some secluded spot<br />\nand leave the students free to do as<br />\nthey choose. This action must not<br />\nbe misconstrued. His departure is<br />\nnot a signal for open discussion of<br />\nthe questions by small groups of<br />\nstudents, and the freedom given to<br />\nthe students should not be misused<br />\nin this way. No license is given to<br />\nanyone to discuss any points of the<br />\nexamination with any of his fellow<br />\nstudents. No so-called \"huddle<br />\nsystems\" should be used. If the<br />\nquestions are not self-explanatory<br />\nand doubt as to their meaning is<br />\nraised in the mind of a student, he<br />\nshould seek an adequate explanation from the instructor and not<br />\nfrom the fellow sitting next to him.<br />\nDuring examination time, it may<br />\nseem strange to some to see students walking out of the examination rooms with the questions in<br />\ntheir hands and seeking out secluded spots where they can work<br />\nout the problems in privacy and<br />\nwhere peace and quiet reign. Under the existing system, every student is privileged to take his examination wherever he so chooses.<br />\nVvhen a student turns in his paper<br />\nat the end of the period and signs<br />\nhis name to the pledge, that signifies to the professor that all the<br />\nwork contained between the blue<br />\ncovers of the book is a result of the<br /><br />\n---o-<br /><br />\nDr. J.
