We are all acquainted with the type of man who<br />\nhas amassed a huge fortune in some form of mercantile endeavor and<br />\nthen does not know what to do with it. Ask yourself whether your<br />\ncollege days have not opened new vistas to your eyes, have not taught<br />\nyou to be content with books, have not freed you from the bond of<br />\nalways needing something to do.<br />\nFurther ask yourself if you have enjoyed your college career.
