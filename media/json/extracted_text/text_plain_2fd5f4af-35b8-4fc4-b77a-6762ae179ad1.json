President<br />\nlu high school of his sophomore,<br />\njunior, and senior classes, last<br />\nYear's freshman class president<br />\nembodies an interesting blend of<br />\ntenacity and unorthodoxy.<br />\n<br />\nAsked to describe his<br />\nphilosophy of leadership, Savitz<br />\nexplained it as being<br />\ncharacterized by the willingness<br />\nto make quick decisions, and at<br />\nthe same time, the ability and<br />\nambition to follow them<br />\nthrough.<br />\n\"I always try to do what a<br />\ngiven situation calls for,\" he said,<br />\nbut overall \"The most important<br />\nthing to me is to be able to get<br />\nthings done.\"<br />\nThis ability to put action and<br />\nreaction in their proper<br />\nperspectives marks Savitz as a<br />\nrather unique figure in the gallery<br />\nof Hopkins SC presidents. Savitz'<br />\nsingularity emerges not only in<br />\nhis idea of leadership, but in his<br />\nviews on other topics as well.<br />\nWhile many of his recent<br />\npredecessors have found<br />\nUniversity administrators to be<br />\ncompromising and apathetic,<br />\nSavitz describes them as easily<br />\naccessible and concerned about<br />\nproblems of student interest.<br />\nIn outlining his opinion of the<br />\nSC's purpose and direction at<br />\nHopkins, Savitz explained the<br />\nCouncil's foremost goal as<br />\n\"Making sure Hopkins students<br />\nget a say in their University.\"<br />\n\"In order to accomplish this\",<br />\nhe continued, \"the SC must have<br />\nthe students behind it.\" Savitz'<br />\nstrategy here is fa fairly simple<br />\none. He maintains that if the Sc<br />\nperforms well in those areas in<br />\nwhich the University has given it<br />\nthe power to formulate or<br />\ninfluence policy, the students<br />\n<br />\nwill become confident of the<br />\nCouncil's efficacy and will begin<br />\nto take an active interest in its<br />\nproceedings.<br />\n\"Once the Council has gained<br />\nthe respect and support of the<br />\nstudent body,\" Savitz contended,<br />\n\"we can attack the larger issues.\"<br />\nThese \"larger issues\", he<br />\nexplained, are those on which the<br />\nUniversity does not consult the<br />\nSC or the student body in<br />\ngeneral. In this way Savitz sees<br />\nthe Council capable of becoming<br />\n*a much more influential voice in<br />\nUniversity affairs.<br />\nPerhaps the most unique of<br />\nSavitz' ideas are those pertaining<br />\nto the change of leadership in the<br />\nSC. As a sophomore, he feels<br />\nthat, if permitted to remain in<br />\noffice to serve a second term, he<br />\ncould bring to the Council a<br />\nperiod of non-readjustment; one<br />\nin which there would be no<br />\nslackening of action or planning<br />\n<br />\n404<br />\nto see that the Council deserves<br />\nsuch unorthodox treatment, and<br />\nunless they prove to be radically<br />\ndifferent from those Hopkins has<br />\nhad in the past, it looks as<br />\nthough he'll have quite a job to<br />\ndo.<br />\n<br />\nSelection Committee to appoint<br />\nundergrads to advisory councils<br />\nBy MITCHELL TENZER<br />\nThe Selection Committee of<br />\nthe Student Council will next<br />\nweek appoint some eleven<br />\nundergraduates to fill positions<br />\non various student -faculty<br />\nadvisory councils next week.<br />\nFlyers circulated among<br />\nundergraduates during the past<br />\nweek have detailed the vacant<br />\n<br />\nHousing difficulties remain<br />\nHousing problems continue to<br />\nPlague University-owned<br />\na partments despite efforts by<br />\nHousing Director Peter Heist and<br />\nHopkins Housing chairmen to<br />\nremedy them.<br />\nJohn Weaver, housing<br />\nc hairman for the Bradford<br />\nA partments stated, \"There were<br />\nno major problems during the<br />\ns ummer months, although<br />\nroaches have proved to be<br />\nsomewhat of a minor nuisance.\"<br />\n,Fle added that the Bradford has a<br />\nbasically<br />\ngood crew of workers\"<br />\nwho were working quickly to<br />\nsolve any problems.<br />\nChairman of the Homewood<br />\nA<br />\npartments housing committee,<br />\nJohn Caldwell, remarked, \"The<br />\nPrimary problem here is the lack<br />\nof a sufficient security force.

In any man's life there is<br />\nconsiderable noncongruity between self<br />\nand persona, but with Richard Nixon the<br />\nself seems to have been all but absorbed<br />\nby the mask.

In view of the ambience of political<br />\nviolence during that spring and summer,<br />\nit is hard to see how such a decision -- and<br />\n-such an explanation --could have resulted<br />\nfrom deliberation within a morally<br />\nimpressionable self. An intriguing<br />\ninterpretation is that the choice of Agnew<br />\nwas directed by a blind need to preserve<br />\nthe mask from the threat of annihilation,<br />\nin that by assuring no advantage would<br />\nresult, Nixon could reduce the chance at<br />\nleast of a \"rational\" assassination.<br />\nBy 1968 it was clear that most<br />\nAmericans wanted to get out of Vietnam.<br />\n<br />\ni<br />\n<br />\nTheater Project: organized chaos<br />\nBy TOM TOTTEN<br />\nAction screams, yells, gestures total<br />\nSilence.

During the campaign<br />\nNixon said he had a plan to end the war<br />\nbut did not reveal it.(We know now that<br />\nplan was Vietnamization and that it was<br />\ndoomed.) What were the moral<br />\nimplications of the Vietnamization<br />\nprogram? More Americans, South<br />\nVietnamese and North Vietnamese lives<br />\n'lost (more than one third of the<br />\nAmericans who died in Vietnam have<br />\ndied since Nixon took office); more<br />\ndestruction of both North and South<br />\nVietnam; more money diverted from<br />\nwhere it was badly needed. To gain what?<br />\nA non-Communist government in South<br />\nVietnam and a chance for us to leave with<br />\n\"honor\".<br />\nBy 1968 the chimera of a Communist<br />\nmonolith had vanished and the argument<br />\nthat a friendly Southeast Asia was<br />\nnecessary to our security severely<br />\nweakened. It was also pretty clear that no<br />\nlong term victory for the South was likely<br />\nwithout massive and continuing assistance<br />\nfrom us. Why then did Nixon persist with<br />\nthe war when the mural reasons for<br />\nputting an end to the fighting there were<br />\nSO compelling? He did so because these<br />\nmoral arguments cut no ice with him,<br />\nbecause they did not impinge on the<br />\nprocess of his making the decision at all.<br />\nRichard Nixon is not, as has been<br />\nsuggested. an immoral man; he is an<br />\namoral man.<br />\nTo Nixon. \"honor- meant not losing<br />\nface, the persona. the mask.

This is our (their, the silent<br />\n. majority's) war because we have been<br />\npermitting it to go on. The polls have<br />\nshown all along that a majority of<br />\nAmericans favored the Vietnamization<br />\nplan. When the mining of Haiphong<br />\nharbor and the intense bombing of Hanoi<br />\nwere initiated recently, the majority again<br />\ngave its approval. And now Nixon's latest<br />\nmove, the saturation bombing of the<br />\nNorth which is aimed at pulverizing as<br />\n<br />\nmuch of that country as is necessary to<br />\nmake it come around, will probably meet<br />\nwith similar approval.<br />\nNor has the majority insisted that its<br />\nSenators and Representatives cut off<br />\nfunds for the war -- this being a<br />\nCongressional perrogative it is Congress'<br />\nwar too).<br />\nThis is the majority's war because the<br />\nmajority continues to choose it by not<br />\ndoing what it could to. stop it.

It waS a<br />\nvoyeur's heaven, a henpecked's hell. I was<br />\nthe only male in a room with over a<br />\nhundred women. To ease my nervousness,<br />\nI began to whistle, but after a few<br />\nif-looks-could-kill-these-would looks. I<br />\nrealized that, though there is a time and<br />\nplace- for everything. this was not the<br />\ntime or place tor a rendition of Stranger<br />\njp Doradise.<br />\n<br />\n1 wandered around for several minutes.<br />\ndoing my best to mingle and blend into<br />\nthe crowd, but considering the crowd and<br />\nthen considering me,that was no easy<br />\nfeat. Finally I struck up a conversation<br />\nwith one of the meeting's organizers, a<br />\nconversation that proceeded quite<br />\namiably until someone whispered in her<br />\near. Suddenly the walls echoed with her<br />\nexclamation: \"So _you're the one who<br />\nwrote the letter to the paper about us.\"<br />\nNothing terrible happened. The<br />\norganizer said that she was glad that I had<br />\ndecided to come to the meeting, because<br />\n\"we were trying to contact you.\" The<br />\nonly other organizers that I ever knew of<br />\nwere those of the corrupt longshoremen<br />\nin On the Waterfront and when they<br />\ncontacted someone, they didn't fool<br />\naround.

Anecdotes were<br />\ntold, speeches were given, and plans were<br />\nmade for the future. Nary a bra was<br />\nburnt. In an odd sense, it was a<br />\ndisappointment.

Last season, this trio<br />\nanchored the third best<br />\ncollege-division rushing defense<br />\nin the country, limiting their<br />\nrivals to a mere 49 yards per<br />\ngame.<br />\nAnd while the defense was<br />\nallowing only 76 points all year,<br />\nquarterback Bob Olender and<br />\nends Dale Schlief and Ray Bain<br />\nled an offense which ran up 180<br />\npoints in just seven games.

Although such<br />\nactions pose a serious threat to<br />\nthe harmony of professional<br />\ntennis in the world, Newcombe<br />\nand his followers deserve to be<br />\ncommended not condemned. The<br />\ncontroversy which they created<br />\nhas helped to shed light on the<br />\nproblems of professional tennis,<br />\nand on the dangerous course the<br />\nsport seems bent on pursUing.<br />\nGuaranteed Money<br />\nWithin the professional tennis<br />\nranks, there are two types of<br />\nplayers: the contract, and the<br />\nindependent, pros. The contract<br />\nplayers are those who have<br />\noffered their services to World<br />\nChampionship Tennis, headed by<br />\nTexas millionaire Lamar Hunt.<br />\nEach player is guaranteed a<br />\ncertain amount of money for the<br />\nyear, and may keep all prize<br />\nmoney that he makes above and<br />\n<br />\nbeyond that figure. In return, he<br />\nmust agree to play 20 sanctioned<br />\nWCT tournaments plus 10 others<br />\nper year, at Hunt's discretion. In<br />\neffect, he is a slave to the<br />\norganization.<br />\nThe independent pros, on the<br />\nother hand, are free to accept<br />\nprize money and are their own<br />\nbosses, free to play or pass up<br />\ntournaments as they see fit. Stan<br />\nSmith, Clark Graebner, and Hie<br />\nNastase are among the most<br />\nfamous independent pros, and it<br />\nis this type of player that<br />\nNewcombe and others seek to<br />\nbecome.<br />\nWorthless<br />\nThe principal advantage<br />\nderived from belonging to Hunt's<br />\ntour is that you are guaranteed<br />\nan annual salary: however, this is<br />\nceasing to be an important<br />\nconsideration. The better players<br />\nare finding out that they can<br />\nmake just as much money<br />\noutside the group, and can select<br />\nwhich tournaments to enter. In<br />\n1970, for example, Rod Laver<br />\nwas guaranteed winnings of<br />\n$90,000 by WCT, and wound up<br />\ncollecting $201,453 in prize<br />\nmoney. In effect, his guarantee<br />\nwas worthless. Now, more and<br />\nmore of the super-stars are<br />\nfinding this out, and as a result,<br />\nHunt's empire is beginning to<br />\ncrumble.<br />\nIt is no surprise that this is<br />\noccurring, because the WCT is<br />\n<br />\nbuilt on a contradiction. Hunt<br />\nmakes his money by delivering<br />\nthe \"stars\", or big drawing cards,<br />\nto the various tournaments. But<br />\nhis contract disenchants the more<br />\nestablished players, the \"stars\",<br />\nbecause they don't need his'<br />\nguarantee and resent the<br />\nobligations implicit in the<br />\nagreement.<br />\n<br />\nJohn Ham-e;it<br />\nLamar Hunt is running a<br />\nbusiness, not trying to promote a<br />\nsport, and this is symptomatic of<br />\na discouraging trend in world<br />\ntennis.

Second,<br />\nGeorge McGovern is the nominee<br />\nof the Democratic Party.<br />\nBecause the Republican Party<br />\nis the minority party in America,<br />\nits nominees traditionally have<br />\nrefrained from stressing party<br />\nlabels. When in recent times they<br />\nhave been successful, it was in<br />\nlarge measure because they were<br />\nable to effectively soft-peddle the<br />\nGOP label and convey a more<br />\nnon-partisan image. 1972 will be<br />\nno exception and will see<br />\nRichard Nixon engulfing himself<br />\nin something with more prestige<br />\nthan the Republican party, the<br />\nPresidency of the United States.<br />\nMcGovern, on the other hand,<br />\nis the candidate of the majority<br />\nparty in this country and realizes<br />\nthat, ideally, little more is needed<br />\n<br />\nif one can be certain of having<br />\nthe vote of every Democrat in<br />\nthe United States. Appeal to<br />\nparty loyalty, even from an<br />\noriginally unconventional<br />\ncandidate like McGovern, is vital.<br />\nSo we will witness that as Nixon<br />\nwraps himself in the aura of the<br />\nPresidency, McGovern will do his<br />\nbest to wrap himself in the<br />\nbosom of the Democratic Party.<br />\nKnowing full well the principle<br />\ndrawing card their opponent has,<br />\n<br />\nNixon and McGovern are seeking<br />\nto disassociate each other from<br />\nthe haven he seeks. While Nixon<br />\nseeks refuge behind the White<br />\nHouse doors and the slogan<br />\n\"Re-elect the President\",<br />\nMcGovern must attack Richard<br />\nNixon, the man, and not Richard<br />\nNixon, the President.<br />\nNixon, the man, as both sides<br />\nwell know has never been a<br />\npopular entity in American<br />\npolitics. When someone reminded<br />\n<br />\nLocal Dems bolt party<br />\nBy TOM NATHAN<br />\nA 1 growing number of<br />\nMaryland Democratic Party<br />\nregulars, dissatisfied with Senator<br />\nGeorge McGovern as their party's<br />\nchoice for President, are<br />\nregistering their discontent by<br />\nenlisting in the newly formed<br />\npolitical group known as<br />\nDemocrats for Nixon.<br />\nThe group, comprised entirely<br />\nof Democrats and totally<br />\nseparate from the Republican<br />\nCommittee to Re-elect the<br />\nPresident, boasts such members<br />\nas Phillip H.

This<br />\npast week millionaire Irving<br />\nKovens, another of Mandel's<br />\n<br />\nchief fund raisers stated he too<br />\nwould support the President in<br />\nhis re-election campaign. W.

Schaefer, city<br />\ncouncilman from one of East<br />\nBaltimore's strongly democratic<br />\ndistricts, are also considering<br />\nwithholding their support for<br />\nSenator McGovern.<br />\nThe reasons for the defections<br />\nare wide, but State Chairman of<br />\nDemocrats for Nixon Harry<br />\nRodgers singled out McGovern's<br />\nconstantly vascilating platforms<br />\nas a source of major discontent<br />\namong area Democrats. He also<br />\nnoted that many Democrats were<br />\nconcerned with Sen. McGovern's<br />\ncredentials for such a demanding<br />\nposition as the Presidency. \"He<br />\n<br />\n(McGovern) has not proved he<br />\nhas the leadership to lead the<br />\ncountry. Nixon has proven<br />\nhimself' and has the country<br />\ngoing in the right direction,\"<br />\nRodgers stated.<br />\nDespite their refusal to back<br />\nthe Democratic nominee for<br />\npresident, most of the members<br />\nof the Democrats for Nixon are<br />\nstaying within the party fold and<br />\nintend to support Democratic<br />\ncandidates for other Federal,<br />\nState, and local offices.<br />\nGovernor Mandel, comment in<br />\non the rash of political defections<br />\nsaid, \"these are friends of mine.<br />\nThey have been lifelong<br />\nfriendsand they will remain<br />\nfriends.

President<br />\nlu high school of his sophomore,<br />\njunior, and senior classes, last<br />\nYear's freshman class president<br />\nembodies an interesting blend of<br />\ntenacity and unorthodoxy.<br /><br />\nAsked to describe his<br />\nphilosophy of leadership, Savitz<br />\nexplained it as being<br />\ncharacterized by the willingness<br />\nto make quick decisions, and at<br />\nthe same time, the ability and<br />\nambition to follow them<br />\nthrough.<br />\n\"I always try to do what a<br />\ngiven situation calls for,\" he said,<br />\nbut overall \"The most important<br />\nthing to me is to be able to get<br />\nthings done.\"<br />\nThis ability to put action and<br />\nreaction in their proper<br />\nperspectives marks Savitz as a<br />\nrather unique figure in the gallery<br />\nof Hopkins SC presidents. Savitz'<br />\nsingularity emerges not only in<br />\nhis idea of leadership, but in his<br />\nviews on other topics as well.<br />\nWhile many of his recent<br />\npredecessors have found<br />\nUniversity administrators to be<br />\ncompromising and apathetic,<br />\nSavitz describes them as easily<br />\naccessible and concerned about<br />\nproblems of student interest.<br />\nIn outlining his opinion of the<br />\nSC's purpose and direction at<br />\nHopkins, Savitz explained the<br />\nCouncil's foremost goal as<br />\n\"Making sure Hopkins students<br />\nget a say in their University.\"<br />\n\"In order to accomplish this\",<br />\nhe continued, \"the SC must have<br />\nthe students behind it.\" Savitz'<br />\nstrategy here is fa fairly simple<br />\none. He maintains that if the Sc<br />\nperforms well in those areas in<br />\nwhich the University has given it<br />\nthe power to formulate or<br />\ninfluence policy, the students<br /><br />\nwill become confident of the<br />\nCouncil's efficacy and will begin<br />\nto take an active interest in its<br />\nproceedings.<br />\n\"Once the Council has gained<br />\nthe respect and support of the<br />\nstudent body,\" Savitz contended,<br />\n\"we can attack the larger issues.\"<br />\nThese \"larger issues\", he<br />\nexplained, are those on which the<br />\nUniversity does not consult the<br />\nSC or the student body in<br />\ngeneral. In this way Savitz sees<br />\nthe Council capable of becoming<br />\n*a much more influential voice in<br />\nUniversity affairs.<br />\nPerhaps the most unique of<br />\nSavitz' ideas are those pertaining<br />\nto the change of leadership in the<br />\nSC. As a sophomore, he feels<br />\nthat, if permitted to remain in<br />\noffice to serve a second term, he<br />\ncould bring to the Council a<br />\nperiod of non-readjustment; one<br />\nin which there would be no<br />\nslackening of action or planning<br /><br />\n404<br />\nto see that the Council deserves<br />\nsuch unorthodox treatment, and<br />\nunless they prove to be radically<br />\ndifferent from those Hopkins has<br />\nhad in the past, it looks as<br />\nthough he'll have quite a job to<br />\ndo.<br /><br />\nSelection Committee to appoint<br />\nundergrads to advisory councils<br />\nBy MITCHELL TENZER<br />\nThe Selection Committee of<br />\nthe Student Council will next<br />\nweek appoint some eleven<br />\nundergraduates to fill positions<br />\non various student -faculty<br />\nadvisory councils next week.<br />\nFlyers circulated among<br />\nundergraduates during the past<br />\nweek have detailed the vacant<br /><br />\nHousing difficulties remain<br />\nHousing problems continue to<br />\nPlague University-owned<br />\na partments despite efforts by<br />\nHousing Director Peter Heist and<br />\nHopkins Housing chairmen to<br />\nremedy them.<br />\nJohn Weaver, housing<br />\nc hairman for the Bradford<br />\nA partments stated, \"There were<br />\nno major problems during the<br />\ns ummer months, although<br />\nroaches have proved to be<br />\nsomewhat of a minor nuisance.\"<br />\n,Fle added that the Bradford has a<br />\nbasically<br />\ngood crew of workers\"<br />\nwho were working quickly to<br />\nsolve any problems.<br />\nChairman of the Homewood<br />\nA<br />\npartments housing committee,<br />\nJohn Caldwell, remarked, \"The<br />\nPrimary problem here is the lack<br />\nof a sufficient security force.

When we were divided and<br />\n. scared, Nixon appealed to what was worst<br />\nin us, and we-the silent majority, that<br />\nis respondedaffirmatively. Since his<br />\nelection he has made decisions which<br />\nhave exacerbated many of the problems<br />\nhe inherited and deepened the sense of<br />\nopprobrium which every sentient citizen<br />\nmust feel, whether this is articulated or<br />\nnOt.<br />\nWe failed as a nation the day we<br />\n. elected Richard Nixon; we failed because<br />\nwe should have known better. For a man<br />\naspiring to the Presidency, the tenor of<br />\nhis years as Congressman, Senator, and<br />\nVice-President suggested considerably less<br />\ncharacter than the minimum desirable.<br />\n.Even more disturbing than his 1946<br />\ncampaign in California for Jerry Voorhis'<br />\nCongressional seat, his ravenous embrace<br />\nof the McCarthy hysteria of the early<br />\nfifties or any of a number of other acts<br />\nthat could be selected from the catalogue,<br />\nis the lack anywhere in Nixon's political<br />\ncareer of a decision or choice that seems<br />\nto have been based on any kind of moral<br />\nconsideration.<br />\nJung makes the distinction between<br />\nthe self and the persona, that mask which<br />\nan individual presents to the world as<br />\nhimself. In any man's life there is<br />\nconsiderable noncongruity between self<br />\nand persona, but with Richard Nixon the<br />\nself seems to have been all but absorbed<br />\nby the mask. (Garry Wills has described<br />\n'Nixon as a self-made man who is utterly<br />\ntself-destroyed.) .<br />\nSo what does a destroyed-self man do<br />\nwhen confronted with the kind of<br />\n\u201edecisions that come to a U.

In view of the ambience of political<br />\nviolence during that spring and summer,<br />\nit is hard to see how such a decision -- and<br />\n-such an explanation --could have resulted<br />\nfrom deliberation within a morally<br />\nimpressionable self. An intriguing<br />\ninterpretation is that the choice of Agnew<br />\nwas directed by a blind need to preserve<br />\nthe mask from the threat of annihilation,<br />\nin that by assuring no advantage would<br />\nresult, Nixon could reduce the chance at<br />\nleast of a \"rational\" assassination.<br />\nBy 1968 it was clear that most<br />\nAmericans wanted to get out of Vietnam.<br /><br />\ni<br /><br />\nTheater Project: organized chaos<br />\nBy TOM TOTTEN<br />\nAction screams, yells, gestures total<br />\nSilence.

During the campaign<br />\nNixon said he had a plan to end the war<br />\nbut did not reveal it.(We know now that<br />\nplan was Vietnamization and that it was<br />\ndoomed.) What were the moral<br />\nimplications of the Vietnamization<br />\nprogram? More Americans, South<br />\nVietnamese and North Vietnamese lives<br />\n'lost (more than one third of the<br />\nAmericans who died in Vietnam have<br />\ndied since Nixon took office); more<br />\ndestruction of both North and South<br />\nVietnam; more money diverted from<br />\nwhere it was badly needed. To gain what?<br />\nA non-Communist government in South<br />\nVietnam and a chance for us to leave with<br />\n\"honor\".<br />\nBy 1968 the chimera of a Communist<br />\nmonolith had vanished and the argument<br />\nthat a friendly Southeast Asia was<br />\nnecessary to our security severely<br />\nweakened. It was also pretty clear that no<br />\nlong term victory for the South was likely<br />\nwithout massive and continuing assistance<br />\nfrom us. Why then did Nixon persist with<br />\nthe war when the mural reasons for<br />\nputting an end to the fighting there were<br />\nSO compelling? He did so because these<br />\nmoral arguments cut no ice with him,<br />\nbecause they did not impinge on the<br />\nprocess of his making the decision at all.<br />\nRichard Nixon is not, as has been<br />\nsuggested. an immoral man; he is an<br />\namoral man.<br />\nTo Nixon. \"honor- meant not losing<br />\nface, the persona. the mask.

This is our (their, the silent<br />\n. majority's) war because we have been<br />\npermitting it to go on. The polls have<br />\nshown all along that a majority of<br />\nAmericans favored the Vietnamization<br />\nplan. When the mining of Haiphong<br />\nharbor and the intense bombing of Hanoi<br />\nwere initiated recently, the majority again<br />\ngave its approval. And now Nixon's latest<br />\nmove, the saturation bombing of the<br />\nNorth which is aimed at pulverizing as<br /><br />\nmuch of that country as is necessary to<br />\nmake it come around, will probably meet<br />\nwith similar approval.<br />\nNor has the majority insisted that its<br />\nSenators and Representatives cut off<br />\nfunds for the war -- this being a<br />\nCongressional perrogative it is Congress'<br />\nwar too).<br />\nThis is the majority's war because the<br />\nmajority continues to choose it by not<br />\ndoing what it could to. stop it.

It waS a<br />\nvoyeur's heaven, a henpecked's hell. I was<br />\nthe only male in a room with over a<br />\nhundred women. To ease my nervousness,<br />\nI began to whistle, but after a few<br />\nif-looks-could-kill-these-would looks.

Finally I struck up a conversation<br />\nwith one of the meeting's organizers, a<br />\nconversation that proceeded quite<br />\namiably until someone whispered in her<br />\near.

Last season, this trio<br />\nanchored the third best<br />\ncollege-division rushing defense<br />\nin the country, limiting their<br />\nrivals to a mere 49 yards per<br />\ngame.<br />\nAnd while the defense was<br />\nallowing only 76 points all year,<br />\nquarterback Bob Olender and<br />\nends Dale Schlief and Ray Bain<br />\nled an offense which ran up 180<br />\npoints in just seven games.

The line--featuring<br />\ncenter Sam Palmisano, guards Joe<br /><br />\nOuslander and Jim Adams, and<br />\ntackles Barry Van Orman and<br />\nMike Riley\u2014is improving rapidly,<br />\nand Cox has \"no doubt that they<br />\ncan do the job.\"<br />\nIf the Blue Jays can control<br />\nthe ball on offense and not give<br />\nthe Diplomats any easy<br />\nopportunities to score through<br />\nturnovers, Hopkins has a good<br />\nchance to win this crucial test.

The<br />\ncontroversy which they created<br />\nhas helped to shed light on the<br />\nproblems of professional tennis,<br />\nand on the dangerous course the<br />\nsport seems bent on pursUing.<br />\nGuaranteed Money<br />\nWithin the professional tennis<br />\nranks, there are two types of<br />\nplayers: the contract, and the<br />\nindependent, pros. The contract<br />\nplayers are those who have<br />\noffered their services to World<br />\nChampionship Tennis, headed by<br />\nTexas millionaire Lamar Hunt.<br />\nEach player is guaranteed a<br />\ncertain amount of money for the<br />\nyear, and may keep all prize<br />\nmoney that he makes above and<br /><br />\nbeyond that figure. In return, he<br />\nmust agree to play 20 sanctioned<br />\nWCT tournaments plus 10 others<br />\nper year, at Hunt's discretion. In<br />\neffect, he is a slave to the<br />\norganization.<br />\nThe independent pros, on the<br />\nother hand, are free to accept<br />\nprize money and are their own<br />\nbosses, free to play or pass up<br />\ntournaments as they see fit. Stan<br />\nSmith, Clark Graebner, and Hie<br />\nNastase are among the most<br />\nfamous independent pros, and it<br />\nis this type of player that<br />\nNewcombe and others seek to<br />\nbecome.<br />\nWorthless<br />\nThe principal advantage<br />\nderived from belonging to Hunt's<br />\ntour is that you are guaranteed<br />\nan annual salary: however, this is<br />\nceasing to be an important<br />\nconsideration. The better players<br />\nare finding out that they can<br />\nmake just as much money<br />\noutside the group, and can select<br />\nwhich tournaments to enter. In<br />\n1970, for example, Rod Laver<br />\nwas guaranteed winnings of<br />\n$90,000 by WCT, and wound up<br />\ncollecting $201,453 in prize<br />\nmoney. In effect, his guarantee<br />\nwas worthless. Now, more and<br />\nmore of the super-stars are<br />\nfinding this out, and as a result,<br />\nHunt's empire is beginning to<br />\ncrumble.<br />\nIt is no surprise that this is<br />\noccurring, because the WCT is<br /><br />\nbuilt on a contradiction. Hunt<br />\nmakes his money by delivering<br />\nthe \"stars\", or big drawing cards,<br />\nto the various tournaments. But<br />\nhis contract disenchants the more<br />\nestablished players, the \"stars\",<br />\nbecause they don't need his'<br />\nguarantee and resent the<br />\nobligations implicit in the<br />\nagreement.<br /><br />\nJohn Ham-e;it<br />\nLamar Hunt is running a<br />\nbusiness, not trying to promote a<br />\nsport, and this is symptomatic of<br />\na discouraging trend in world<br />\ntennis. When business consumes<br />\nsport it is time for reevaluation,<br />\nand such time is rapidly<br />\napproaching.<br /><br />\nseptember 29, 1972/news-letter/page 11<br /><br />\nSoccer Preview<br /><br />\nBlue Jay booters to test Towson State Tigers<br />\nBy CHUCK SLONIM<br />\nThe tropical downpour which<br />\nhit the Homewood campus<br />\nWednesday afternoon while the<br />\nBlue Jays were scrimmaging<br />\nEssex Community College, fell as<br />\na reminder of last year's loss to<br />\nTowson State College.<br />\nThe rains on Wednesday<br />\nweren't half as bad as they were<br />\nbefore, during, and after the Blue<br /><br />\nJay defeat last season on<br />\nTowson's field. They did,<br />\nhowever, bring back some bitter<br />\nmemories of a game which, while<br />\nscoreless at the half, could have<br />\nbeen ended in a 0-0 tie score as<br />\nwas requested by the Towson<br />\ncoach. However, the fighting<br />\nBlue had gone to win and<br />\ndemanded that play continue.<br />\nThe game turned out to be a<br /><br />\nbattle of luck rather than one of<br />\nskill. Seemingly easy passes and<br />\nplays were thwarted by pools of<br />\nwater and mud instead of by the<br />\nopponents.<br />\nHopkins had outshot the<br />\nTigers of Towson but saw a<br />\nnumber of their shots stop dead<br />\nin a quagmire of mud just outside<br />\nthe net in front of the Towson<br />\ngoalie.

The Essex<br />\nright wing sent a lead pass into<br />\nthe center that was easily in John<br />\nGoldwine's range.

Second,<br />\nGeorge McGovern is the nominee<br />\nof the Democratic Party.<br />\nBecause the Republican Party<br />\nis the minority party in America,<br />\nits nominees traditionally have<br />\nrefrained from stressing party<br />\nlabels. When in recent times they<br />\nhave been successful, it was in<br />\nlarge measure because they were<br />\nable to effectively soft-peddle the<br />\nGOP label and convey a more<br />\nnon-partisan image. 1972 will be<br />\nno exception and will see<br />\nRichard Nixon engulfing himself<br />\nin something with more prestige<br />\nthan the Republican party, the<br />\nPresidency of the United States.<br />\nMcGovern, on the other hand,<br />\nis the candidate of the majority<br />\nparty in this country and realizes<br />\nthat, ideally, little more is needed<br /><br />\nif one can be certain of having<br />\nthe vote of every Democrat in<br />\nthe United States. Appeal to<br />\nparty loyalty, even from an<br />\noriginally unconventional<br />\ncandidate like McGovern, is vital.<br />\nSo we will witness that as Nixon<br />\nwraps himself in the aura of the<br />\nPresidency, McGovern will do his<br />\nbest to wrap himself in the<br />\nbosom of the Democratic Party.<br />\nKnowing full well the principle<br />\ndrawing card their opponent has,<br /><br />\nNixon and McGovern are seeking<br />\nto disassociate each other from<br />\nthe haven he seeks.
