New evidence, in the form<br />\nof a letter written by two Goucher freshmen and addressed to IFC Representative Ogden Hamilton, was responsible<br />\nfor the Council's determination that Phi<br />\nPsi had violated its probation terms and<br />\nfor the subsequent rush ban.<br />\nThe Judicial Board determined that<br />\nPhi Psi violated its probation by (a),<br />\nhaving a party on September 30th\u2014the<br />\nfirst day of the fall semester\u2014with<br />\nmore than five couples in attendance.<br />\nand (b), by permiting two Hopkins<br />\nfreshmen to enter the fraternity house<br />\nfor the purpose of borrowing an identification card.<br />\nQuestion Raised<br />\nThe question of possible violation of<br />\nthe probation was first, raised by the<br />\nletter of January 23rd, and was brought<br />\nbefore the full IFC at last Friday's meeting. At that time, the Council decided<br />\nto hold the Judicial Board proceeding on<br />\nMonday.<br />\nSubsequent to the IFC's decision to<br />\nhold a judicial proceeding, one of the<br />\ngirls who had signed the letter retracted<br />\nher signature.

This was impossible, he said, because the alleged<br />\nviolations were reported more than 48<br />\nhours after they had occured. Rather,<br />\nthe fraternity was tried for violation of<br />\nthe probation terms imposed after last<br />\nyear's Fort McHenry incident.<br />\nBefore the final vote was taken, Dave<br />\nKagan, president of Phi Psi, commented<br />\nthat unfavorable action by the IFC was<br />\nlikely to endanger the fraternity's chances of obtaining a new house, and added that a representative of the Phi<br />\nKappa Psi national organization had<br />\nIntimated were the rush ban to take<br />\neffect) that it might be best for the<br />\nchapter to disaffiliate and become a<br />\nlocal fraternity.<br />\nAlumni Response<br />\nOn Tuesday, Larry Schmidt, IFC president, was called in by Robert MacGill,<br />\nthe University's assistant director of<br />\nalumni relations, and told that, from<br />\nthe alumni standpoint, the Council's action was unwise in that it threatened<br />\nto compromise Phi Psi's opportunity to<br />\nacquire new quarters.

Consider the skuation<br />\nat other campuses: At the University of Maryland, the<br />\nUniversity bookstore competes with a private firm, the<br />\nMaryland Book Exchange, which is located adjacent to<br />\nthe school's grounds. While the latter store does not<br />\nnecessarily discount items, it does have a large stock<br />\nof both required and other hooks, as well as supplies.<br />\nThus, the University bookstore does not enjoy a virtual<br />\nmonopoly, as does ours. At Columbia, the campus bookmore does discount some items, and the entire Morningside Heights neighborhood is packed with a wide<br />\nvariety of booksellers. Likewise, Harvard Square is filled<br />\nwith bookstores. And Harvard, as well as Yale, has a<br />\ncooperative, open to the general public as well as University people.

DITRRETTE, JR. .<br />\nWhen one considers what the<br />\n'role of the national government<br />\nIs to be in financing elementary<br />\nand secondary education, he<br />\nshould\u2014unless he be cursed with<br />\nthat blind faith which holds<br />\nthat everything can be best done<br />\nfrom<br />\nWashington\u2014ask<br />\nsome<br />\nquestions. 1) Is there really a<br />\nproblem serious enough to require national action? 2) If so,<br />\nwhat are its causes? 3) What<br />\ntype of action is appropriate? 4)<br />\nAssuming that there is a problem whose cause can be remedied<br />\nby some national action, and assume further that we desire to<br />\npreserve local control and diversity in education (which<br />\nsome misguided souls, quite certain of their own particular wisdom, will not grant); assuming<br />\nthis, how can we have national<br />\nrelief without the control?<br />\nThe usual rallying cry from<br />\nthe \"let Washington do everything\" crowd Ls that the state<br />\nand local governments have<br />\nfailed to meet the challenge and<br />\naction is demanded immediately.<br />\nBut consider the following<br />\nfacts. In the 10 school years<br />\nprior to the enactment of the<br />\nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, pupil-enrollment in the nation's elementary public schools rose 30 million to 42.9 million, or 43'4. Revenues for education leaped from<br />\n$8.5 billion to $21.8 billion, or<br />\n15%. All but 4% of these monies<br />\neame from state and local<br />\nsources: national participation<br />\nwas miniscule..<br />\nOf course, money is only one<br />\nmeasurement, but note also that<br />\nthe number of classrooms increased 58,V,, instructional staffs<br />\ngrew 56%, teachers' salaries rose<br />\n65% (the national average for<br />\nother wage earners improved by<br />\nonly 44%), the number of pu-<br />\n<br />\npils per teacher dropped from<br />\n26 to 23.9, and finally 70,000<br />\nclassroonris a year have been<br />\nbuilt locally (700,000 from 19541964), whereas the late President Kennedy pleaded for only<br />\n60,000 per year. In this decade<br />\nof monumental progress, elementary and secondary school<br />\nenrollment increased, as noted,<br />\n43%, while projections for the<br />\nnext decade forecast only 13%.<br />\nFrom these facts most Republican legislators have concluded<br />\nthat the case for national involvement in elementary and<br />\nsecondary education embodied<br />\nin the Act of 1965 is weak indeed. The minority report makes<br />\nthis clear and concludes that<br />\nthe motives of its supporters<br />\nwere not altogether \"educational.\" For example, the bulk of<br />\nthe funds\u2014$1 billion in the first<br />\nyear\u2014are to be distributed under Title I of the Act which purports to follow the outline of the<br />\nfederal government. The result<br />\nof the \"formula,\" however, is<br />\nthat the funds would be dis-<br />\n<br />\npersed widely among 94% of<br />\nthe nation's counties.<br />\nThe 10 wealthiest counties<br />\nwill receive $8.'918,087 for 32.563<br />\neligible children, while 10 poor<br />\ncounties are allotted $4.507,149<br />\nfor 32,452 eligible children. The<br />\nmedian incomes in the first<br />\ngroup range from $7,371 to<br />\n$9,317 and in the second from<br />\n$1,260 to $2,437. The wealthiest<br />\ncounty in the U.S. even receives<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 million rollars to fight \"poverty\" in its schools. The political<br />\nreasons for giving nearly every<br />\ncounty a vested interest are obvious, and the Republicans tried<br />\nto strengthen the bill by amend=<br />\nment to eliminate the wealthiest<br />\ncounties from the benefit of<br />\nFederal funds, thus concentrating assistance in urban slum<br />\nand poor rural districts and to<br />\nfocus every title of the bill on<br />\nprograms for educationally and<br />\neconomically deprived children.<br />\nThat the reality of Federal<br />\ncontrol is no myth can be demonstrated by two examples. Illinois Congressman Robert H.<br />\n<br />\nMichel recently made public a<br />\n\"confidential\" memorandum of<br />\na Federal Office of Education<br />\nexecutive group meeting of August 26, 1965 which laid down<br />\nthe following \"guideline\"; \"No<br />\nOffice of Education hand is to<br />\nbe tied by 1) having to deal<br />\nonly through a backward state<br />\neducation agency or 2) not being able to deal directly with urban jurisdiction, however, competent the state education agency, when direct relationships<br />\nseem most In the public interest.\"<br />\nThe Republican alternatives<br />\nseek to accomplish two goals<br />\nwhich are so obviously desirable<br />\nthat no positive argumentation<br />\nseems necessary: 1) assist directly school districts having a<br />\nhigh concentration of deprived<br />\nfamilies, and 21 avoid Federal<br />\ncontrol by returning revenue resources to the states, localities,<br />\nand institutions by means of tax<br />\ncredits and direct payments to<br />\nneedy recipients. One such proposal by Congressman Richard<br />\n<br />\nH. Poll' of Virginia was to authorize a credit (not deduction)<br />\nagainst the Federal Income Tax<br />\nfor new prospective state and<br />\nlocal taxes imposed for school<br />\nimprovement purposes.<br />\nThe Republican suggestions<br />\nhave had great appeal to those<br />\nwho value educational diversity,<br />\nto those who are not enraptured<br />\nby the myths of the 1930's that<br />\nall wisdom and enlightenment<br />\noriginates on the Potomac and<br />\nto those who genuinely want to<br />\nprotnote progress in education<br />\nand not progress in politics.<br />\nBecause the national government's role would be seriously<br />\nmodified under the GOP proposals, the Administration and<br />\nthe election-minded Congress it<br />\ncontrols rejected them last year<br />\nand are likely to do so again.<br />\nThough it may benefit the<br />\nDemocratic party (not necessarily, however, if the Republican<br />\nmessage can be heard), the Administration's present education policies hardly benefit the<br />\nAmerican public.<br />\n<br />\n\"Let's unplug the computer, boys!<br />\nStart thinking!\"<br />\n<br />\nHonor<br />\nAs of February 21, 1966, the<br />\npossession of a master key to<br />\nGilman, Mergenthaler, Rowland, Ames, Latrobe, Maryland. or Remsen Halls by an<br />\nundergraduate shall be considered an honor violation.<br />\nUndergraduates needing keys<br />\nto these buildings may retain<br />\nthem only with the written<br />\npermission of both Dean Morrill and the Plant Manager.<br />\nAny student now holding such<br />\na key should deliver it immediately to Dean Morrill.<br />\n<br />\n0000<br />\n000<br />\n1700 0 0<br />\n<br />\nRecruitment Interview<br />\nMark your calendar NOW for<br />\nFriday, February 25-9 to 5<br />\n\u2014 Placement Bureau, 100<br />\nWhitehead Hall.

But the move is not a cure-all.<br />\nWhy should one pay list price for recordings (as $ueh<br />\nmerchandise will undoubtedly cost, in keeping with the<br />\nBookstore's present policy on books and supplies), when<br />\na short trip off campus allows one to buy records at a<br />\nsubstantial discount?

Now, the problem is one<br />\nof implementation. First, it is unfortunate that the Bookstore situation is considered as a \"long range\" problem;<br />\nquestions raised seem far too immediate.

Consider the skuation<br />\nat other campuses: At the University of Maryland, the<br />\nUniversity bookstore competes with a private firm, the<br />\nMaryland Book Exchange, which is located adjacent to<br />\nthe school's grounds. While the latter store does not<br />\nnecessarily discount items, it does have a large stock<br />\nof both required and other hooks, as well as supplies.<br />\nThus, the University bookstore does not enjoy a virtual<br />\nmonopoly, as does ours. At Columbia, the campus bookmore does discount some items, and the entire Morningside Heights neighborhood is packed with a wide<br />\nvariety of booksellers. Likewise, Harvard Square is filled<br />\nwith bookstores. And Harvard, as well as Yale, has a<br />\ncooperative, open to the general public as well as University people. All pay cash; students and faculty register<br />\neach purchase and receive a rebate\u2014sometimes as high<br />\nas ten percent\u2014at the end of the year.<br />\nIt is unrealistic to compare university patronage at<br />\nthese other stores with that which might lw expected<br />\nif an independent bookstore were to open in the Homewood vicinity. Hopkins is simply not large enough to<br />\nsupport, by itself, a commercial bookstore. But Hopkins<br />\nbusiness could well be the nucleus for a store in the<br />\narea, and the added, even if slight, inconvenience, of<br />\nhaving to go off campus to purchase books and supplies<br />\nmight well be offset if such a store were to offer students<br />\na much wider selection of merchandise, and, most important, a discount\u2014whether on the spot or under a<br />\ncooperative arrangement.

DITRRETTE, JR. .<br />\nWhen one considers what the<br />\n'role of the national government<br />\nIs to be in financing elementary<br />\nand secondary education, he<br />\nshould\u2014unless he be cursed with<br />\nthat blind faith which holds<br />\nthat everything can be best done<br />\nfrom<br />\nWashington\u2014ask<br />\nsome<br />\nquestions. 1) Is there really a<br />\nproblem serious enough to require national action? 2) If so,<br />\nwhat are its causes? 3) What<br />\ntype of action is appropriate? 4)<br />\nAssuming that there is a problem whose cause can be remedied<br />\nby some national action, and assume further that we desire to<br />\npreserve local control and diversity in education (which<br />\nsome misguided souls, quite certain of their own particular wisdom, will not grant); assuming<br />\nthis, how can we have national<br />\nrelief without the control?<br />\nThe usual rallying cry from<br />\nthe \"let Washington do everything\" crowd Ls that the state<br />\nand local governments have<br />\nfailed to meet the challenge and<br />\naction is demanded immediately.<br />\nBut consider the following<br />\nfacts. In the 10 school years<br />\nprior to the enactment of the<br />\nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, pupil-enrollment in the nation's elementary public schools rose 30 million to 42.9 million, or 43'4. Revenues for education leaped from<br />\n$8.5 billion to $21.8 billion, or<br />\n15%. All but 4% of these monies<br />\neame from state and local<br />\nsources: national participation<br />\nwas miniscule..<br />\nOf course, money is only one<br />\nmeasurement, but note also that<br />\nthe number of classrooms increased 58,V,, instructional staffs<br />\ngrew 56%, teachers' salaries rose<br />\n65% (the national average for<br />\nother wage earners improved by<br />\nonly 44%), the number of pu-<br /><br />\npils per teacher dropped from<br />\n26 to 23.9, and finally 70,000<br />\nclassroonris a year have been<br />\nbuilt locally (700,000 from 19541964), whereas the late President Kennedy pleaded for only<br />\n60,000 per year. In this decade<br />\nof monumental progress, elementary and secondary school<br />\nenrollment increased, as noted,<br />\n43%, while projections for the<br />\nnext decade forecast only 13%.<br />\nFrom these facts most Republican legislators have concluded<br />\nthat the case for national involvement in elementary and<br />\nsecondary education embodied<br />\nin the Act of 1965 is weak indeed. The minority report makes<br />\nthis clear and concludes that<br />\nthe motives of its supporters<br />\nwere not altogether \"educational.\" For example, the bulk of<br />\nthe funds\u2014$1 billion in the first<br />\nyear\u2014are to be distributed under Title I of the Act which purports to follow the outline of the<br />\nfederal government. The result<br />\nof the \"formula,\" however, is<br />\nthat the funds would be dis-<br /><br />\npersed widely among 94% of<br />\nthe nation's counties.<br />\nThe 10 wealthiest counties<br />\nwill receive $8.'918,087 for 32.563<br />\neligible children, while 10 poor<br />\ncounties are allotted $4.507,149<br />\nfor 32,452 eligible children. The<br />\nmedian incomes in the first<br />\ngroup range from $7,371 to<br />\n$9,317 and in the second from<br />\n$1,260 to $2,437. The wealthiest<br />\ncounty in the U.S. even receives<br />\n/<br />\n1<br />\n2 million rollars to fight \"poverty\" in its schools. The political<br />\nreasons for giving nearly every<br />\ncounty a vested interest are obvious, and the Republicans tried<br />\nto strengthen the bill by amend=<br />\nment to eliminate the wealthiest<br />\ncounties from the benefit of<br />\nFederal funds, thus concentrating assistance in urban slum<br />\nand poor rural districts and to<br />\nfocus every title of the bill on<br />\nprograms for educationally and<br />\neconomically deprived children.<br />\nThat the reality of Federal<br />\ncontrol is no myth can be demonstrated by two examples. Illinois Congressman Robert H.<br /><br />\nMichel recently made public a<br />\n\"confidential\" memorandum of<br />\na Federal Office of Education<br />\nexecutive group meeting of August 26, 1965 which laid down<br />\nthe following \"guideline\"; \"No<br />\nOffice of Education hand is to<br />\nbe tied by 1) having to deal<br />\nonly through a backward state<br />\neducation agency or 2) not being able to deal directly with urban jurisdiction, however, competent the state education agency, when direct relationships<br />\nseem most In the public interest.\"<br />\nThe Republican alternatives<br />\nseek to accomplish two goals<br />\nwhich are so obviously desirable<br />\nthat no positive argumentation<br />\nseems necessary: 1) assist directly school districts having a<br />\nhigh concentration of deprived<br />\nfamilies, and 21 avoid Federal<br />\ncontrol by returning revenue resources to the states, localities,<br />\nand institutions by means of tax<br />\ncredits and direct payments to<br />\nneedy recipients. One such proposal by Congressman Richard<br /><br />\nH. Poll' of Virginia was to authorize a credit (not deduction)<br />\nagainst the Federal Income Tax<br />\nfor new prospective state and<br />\nlocal taxes imposed for school<br />\nimprovement purposes.<br />\nThe Republican suggestions<br />\nhave had great appeal to those<br />\nwho value educational diversity,<br />\nto those who are not enraptured<br />\nby the myths of the 1930's that<br />\nall wisdom and enlightenment<br />\noriginates on the Potomac and<br />\nto those who genuinely want to<br />\nprotnote progress in education<br />\nand not progress in politics.<br />\nBecause the national government's role would be seriously<br />\nmodified under the GOP proposals, the Administration and<br />\nthe election-minded Congress it<br />\ncontrols rejected them last year<br />\nand are likely to do so again.<br />\nThough it may benefit the<br />\nDemocratic party (not necessarily, however, if the Republican<br />\nmessage can be heard), the Administration's present education policies hardly benefit the<br />\nAmerican public.<br /><br />\n\"Let's unplug the computer, boys!<br />\nStart thinking!\"<br /><br />\nHonor<br />\nAs of February 21, 1966, the<br />\npossession of a master key to<br />\nGilman, Mergenthaler, Rowland, Ames, Latrobe, Maryland. or Remsen Halls by an<br />\nundergraduate shall be considered an honor violation.<br />\nUndergraduates needing keys<br />\nto these buildings may retain<br />\nthem only with the written<br />\npermission of both Dean Morrill and the Plant Manager.<br />\nAny student now holding such<br />\na key should deliver it immediately to Dean Morrill.<br /><br />\n0000<br />\n000<br />\n1700 0 0<br /><br />\nRecruitment Interview<br />\nMark your calendar NOW for<br />\nFriday, February 25-9 to 5<br />\n\u2014 Placement Bureau, 100<br />\nWhitehead Hall.
