Dr. Steven David,<br />\nassociate professor of political<br />\nscience, was invited by the Student Council to present the lecture, which was created to honor<br />\na member of the faculty who has<br />\ndone much to help the<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins.<br />\nThe lecture was presented in a<br />\nmanner unlike the format adhered<br />\nto by former honorees. Before<br />\nDavid spoke, there was a picnic<br />\nin his honor. David mingled with<br />\n<br />\nthe students on the steps of<br />\nGilman. Rain then forced the<br />\ncelebration to be moved to the<br />\nGarrett Room of MSE, where<br />\nDavid presented an informal and<br />\ninformative discussion.<br />\nDavid began by providing a little insight into his philosophy in<br />\nhis classroom and various events<br />\nin his life that may have shaped<br />\nhis perspective on international<br />\npolitics.<br />\nHe considers himself fairly<br />\nconservative in terms of the international arena. He explained,<br />\n\"As bad as the U.S. may be, the<br />\nrest of the world is a lot worse.\"<br />\nDavid discussed war in the con-<br />\n<br />\ntext of international policy<br />\nchoices. Although war is a ternble thing, he said, there are<br />\n\"worse things than war.\" He explained that he sees a strong<br />\ndefense as essential for the United<br />\nStates. \"I would rather err on the<br />\nside of being overprepared rather<br />\nthan less prepared.\"<br />\nAccording to David, the U.S.<br />\nmust always be on its guard. In<br />\nhis opinion, isolationism is \"a<br />\nchoice but not an escape.\"<br />\nDavid went on to discuss the<br />\noften noticeable divergence between the people of a country and<br />\nits government. He recounted a<br />\nnumber of occurrences during his<br />\n<br />\nStatement on Free Expression<br />\nPresented to Student Council<br />\nby Tom McNamara<br />\nAt Wednesday's Student Council meeting, President Mark<br />\nKomisky distributed a draft of a<br />\nstatement on freedom of expression. He said that the document<br />\nwas compiled from statements<br />\ngiven to him by Buildings and<br />\nGrounds Chairman Jim Finnerty<br />\nand Sophomore Class Representative Susan Land.<br />\nCouncil has not yet voted on<br />\nwhat is to be done with the draft,<br />\nalthough Komisky has asked for<br />\nhelp in preparing another version<br />\nfor presentation at the next<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nKomisky said that the draft<br />\nrepresents \"a sort of comprehensive memo\" to the Hopkins community on the subject. According<br />\nto its introduction, the \"statement<br />\n<br />\nis by no means to be a definitive<br />\nwork on freedom of expression<br />\nbut rather is to serve as a basis for<br />\nfurther discourse on the issue.\"<br />\nThe memo includes the claim<br />\nthat the \"Flathman Report\"<br />\nissued by the University's Committee on Freedom of Expression<br />\n\"leans toward the notion of an<br />\nabsolute freedom, however,<br />\ndiscussion among many members<br />\nof the Hopkins community has<br />\npointed toward the need for further investigation.\"<br />\nThe memo consists of seven<br />\npoints, covering a broad range of<br />\nissues related to fieedom of expression. It defines a \"legitimate<br />\nact of free expression\" as \"any<br />\nact intended by the agent to communicate to other persons some<br />\nproposition, position, attitude,<br />\netc., with significance to a<br />\n<br />\ngenerality of interest. This includes displays of symbols and<br />\ndemonstrations.\"<br />\nHowever, according to another<br />\nstatement in the memo, \"certain<br />\nexpressions must be limited in<br />\nsome circumstances by balancing<br />\ntheir value with the requirements<br />\nof essential and necessary functioning of the University and<br />\ncomtemporary social norms.<br />\nDefinition of these norms must be<br />\ninterpreted quite liberally to allow<br />\nfor new ideas but must also include restrictions pertaining to<br />\ncrude, ludicrous, and generally<br />\nunproductive actions.\"<br />\nIn addition, it said, \"suppression of an act of [legitimate] expression, in order to be<br />\nlegitimate, must appeal to a<br />\nContinued on Page 2<br />\n<br />\nstudy in Africa to illustrate this<br />\npoint. He explained that the peopie were warm and good, but the<br />\ngovernments were often terribly<br />\ncorrupt. \"Governments are by<br />\nand large not good,\" he said.<br />\n\"Just understanding them will not<br />\nbring peace.\"<br />\nHe continued with more discussion of the international arena and<br />\nthen opened the discussion to the<br />\nstudents for questions and cornments.

Genest acknowledged,<br />\n\"It's a bit risky to go forward.<br />\nWe've heard it through the<br />\ngrapevine that the judge might not<br />\nbe well-disposed to the Coalition.\"<br />\nHe added that University President Steven Muller, who presides<br />\nover the Academic Council, \"is<br />\nnot willing to budge on this. The<br />\nPresident is not going to relieve<br />\nthese people of the fear of a short<br />\njail sentence and a heavy fine.\"<br />\nNo specific court appearance<br />\ndate for the four students has been<br />\nset, according to Genest, but he<br />\nadded that a date would likely be set<br />\nfor late May. \"There's a possibility<br />\nit'll come up sooner,\" he said.<br />\nnoting that the four charged will<br />\nprobably be out of Baltimore in<br />\nlate May.<br />\n\"We think it's just absurd_<br />\ngiven the response of the University community, \" he said.<br />\n\"There seems something vindictive and hypocritical in leaving<br />\nthe charges hanging over the<br />\nheads of the [students].\"<br />\nIn other Coalition news:<br />\n*The Coalition built a fifth oncampus shanty Sunday afternoon,<br />\nContinued on Page 5<br />\n<br />\nWhat's Inside<br />\nThe Stickmen get back on<br />\ntrack with a 9-6 nuking of Army.

Wu<br />\n\"John Hopkins\u2014so you want<br />\nto be a doctor.\"<br />\nAnd so it is said again, innocent, but a reminder of the problems our University faces. If it<br />\nis known to the average, even<br />\nwell-educated family member, it<br />\nis known for the medical school.<br />\nEven as it is working on a<br />\nmassive fund-raising effort,<br />\nHopkins does not have the reputation it deserves. Sure enough, the<br />\nHomewood campus itself is not<br />\nimpressive, lacking the size of<br />\nmost, and the single monumental<br />\nbuilding of almost all other top<br />\nschools. Perhaps it is a simple<br />\nreaction to this, that the school<br />\ncalls itself THE Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, as if to distinguish<br />\nitself from others of the same<br />\nname.<br />\nThe founding of Hopkins set it<br />\napart immediately. Unlike Harvard, it was not a college first, a<br />\nUnlike<br />\nlater.<br />\nuniversity<br />\nMichigan, it did not have the<br />\nbenefits of being a land-grant<br />\nuniversity. Instead, it followed<br />\nthe German model from the start,<br />\ninnovative, if oppressive, coming<br />\ninto being as two institutions, the<br />\nschool, and the medical<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nAs higher education is called<br />\nupon to reform itself(even if only by a government administration known for introducing partisan bias into all situations),<br />\nHopkins should take a look at<br />\nitself, for its problems are not<br />\nmerely those of publicity and<br />\nfame.<br />\nAs far as undergraduate education goes, the underlying problem<br />\nis of internal division. The branches of the University are<br />\nsegregated, as are the academic<br />\ndisciplines, the sexes, and the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nWhile the China program, the<br />\nMontgomery County project, and<br />\nthe downtown center are worthy,<br />\nit is odd that so much less emphasis is placed on the<br />\nHomewood campus, and providing a college education. It is<br />\nnot a matter of too many graduate<br />\nprograms; it is a matter of too few<br />\nundergraduate counterparts. The<br />\nschool may have been better off<br />\ngiving up undergraduate education altogether, as it considered in<br />\nthe Twenties.<br />\n<br />\nThe non-science departments<br />\nare not weak, but their reputations are. Even those that are nationally known, such as English,<br />\nHistory, and Writing Seminars,<br />\nare not respected on-campus. The<br />\nscientific bent is not just an attitude problem on the part of<br />\nstudents. It is a circular, systemic<br />\nproblem. The library has an appalling lack of literature, the<br />\nhumanities departments have the<br />\nworst accomodations, and there is<br />\na lack of innovative interdepartmental programs. There<br />\nwere no women's studies until<br />\nthis year. There are still no<br />\nethnic, science and culture, or introductory writing programs.<br />\nThe sex-balance problem has<br />\nbeen documented, discussed, and<br />\nforgotten. It exists at other<br />\nschools, but it's worse here. The<br />\nsame applies with minority administrators and faculty. An additional disadvantage at Hopkins<br />\nis the infamous \"ratio\" amongst<br />\nstudents. The two-to-one malefemale distribution does no end of<br />\nharm toward the development of<br />\nstudents as responsible adults. It's<br />\nsimply a bad thing.<br />\nThe ratio is but a part of the<br />\nsocial life at Hopkins. The rest of<br />\nit is equally unsettling. It is often<br />\nsaid that social life exists at<br />\nHopkins, but like other aspects of<br />\nthe school, must be sought out.<br />\npursued with vigour. There is<br />\nnothing wrong with a challenge.<br />\nThere is, however, no need to<br />\nmake life unnecessarily difficult.<br />\nThe University's contribution<br />\nto the community is a lack of one.<br />\nThis is most unfortunate with<br />\nrespect to housing. It may well be<br />\nthat the situation at Hopkins<br />\nmakes for more adult-like<br />\nbehavior, but that's unlikely, and<br />\na weak excuse, for when the administration speaks of community it ignores its own creation of<br />\na fragmented non-community,<br />\nscattered off-campus.<br />\nIt has been said that we are the<br />\nchildren who were picked last for<br />\nkickball, who played \"Dungeons<br />\nand Dragons\" in gifted programs, who are Ivy-League rejects. President Muller finds the<br />\nschool \"nerd-like.\" He leads the<br />\nschool well, in a building effort,<br />\nbut college education is changing<br />\nrapidly. Hopkins ought to improve itself before it reaches the<br />\nlevel of its reputation.<br />\n<br />\nSpam on Wry<br />\nYes Virginia, there is High<br />\nFashion at Hopkins.

So admit it, the Course<br />\nGuide is quite a popular item<br />\nsimply because it is quite a useful<br />\none.<br />\nThe Course Guide's popularity is most clearly demonstrated in<br />\nthe fact that the 3,500 copies that<br />\nare distributed on the first day of<br />\nadvising period each semester<br />\ndisappear in a mere three days.<br />\nBusiness Manager Richard Pan<br />\nbelieves that the Course Guide's<br />\nimportance lies in the fact that it<br />\nprovides a \"continuing source<br />\nthat offers a critique of<br />\nundergraduate education.\" It's<br />\npurpose is twofold. First it seeks<br />\nto provide information which will<br />\nallow students to make better informed decisions about which<br />\ncourses they should take. Secondly, the Course Guide serves as a<br />\nmeans through which professors<br />\ncan learn of their students'<br />\nresponses and reactions to their<br />\nclasses. The Course Guide offers<br />\na detailed and up-to-date critique<br />\nof undergraduate education at<br />\nHopkins. All classes up to the<br />\n400-level that are technically<br />\nundergraduate are reviewed\u2014a<br />\ntotal of between 200 and 250<br />\nclasses.<br />\nThe Course Guide is a unique<br />\nclub in that it is a student<br />\norganization that truly requires<br />\nthe cooperation of the entire student body and the entire faculty.<br />\nPan urges students to show their<br />\ninterest in the Course Guide. \"If<br />\nstudents want it, they should really try to cooperate\" he says.

In any case, here's today's article, a subject near and<br />\ndear to every Hopkins student<br />\nalive. . .<br />\nWhere to go to study? Just two<br />\nweeks ago I had an amazing test<br />\nin History of the Earth and Its<br />\nBiota, which, incidently, is a nice<br />\nway to earn those N credits. So<br />\nanyway, I was about a month<br />\nbehind in the reading, and needed a quiet place to relax and open<br />\nup to Chapter 9 of Earth and Life<br />\nThrough Time, written, incredibly, by the professor<br />\nhimself. Don't you hate it when<br />\nthe prof has written the book<br />\nyou're using in the course? You<br />\ncan say to him, \"Excuse me, sir,<br />\nI have a different interpretation. I<br />\ndon't think the author meant<br />\nthat,\" to which the prof will reply, \"Yes I did.\" What a burden.<br />\nSo anyway, I couldn't think of<br />\na good place to study. What were<br />\nmy choices? Well, the most obvious choice is the library. It's not<br />\na bad place to study, but it's so<br />\nobvious. Everyone studies there.<br />\nYou can go into the reserve<br />\nroom, but don't you dare open<br />\nyour mouth, even to breathe, lest<br />\nsome vicious, obnoxious<br />\nemployee trying to make up for<br />\na bad chiLlhood wiii bellow.<br />\n<br />\nAVIA<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n.<br />\n.1<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n.......<br />\n<br />\n^<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nVenkl %4.tA *.<br />\n;<br />\n\u2022<br />\nArt''!'\" \u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\n. \u2022 \u2022 -.\u2022\u2022.<br />\n<br />\nto<br />\n<br />\n\"QUIET, YOU FOOL!!!\" two<br />\ninches in front of your face.

I was,<br />\nneedless to say, traumatized by<br />\nthe incident, and consequently<br />\nhaven't been able to eat since, so<br />\nthe library is definitely out.<br />\nWell, where then? There are<br />\nother possibilities. You can go up<br />\nto the roof of Wolman with a<br />\nflashlight. This is not so bad. You<br />\ncould go out to the Loch Raven<br />\nReservoir (this is my favorite\u2014<br />\nthe Shark loves the country) and<br />\nbe one with nature.

Why here, of all<br />\nplaces? Well, it's obvious. For the<br />\nthird floor of said rowhouse is the<br />\nhome of my roommate from<br />\nfreshman year, David Scott Battleman. How do I arrive at the<br />\nfact that his room is the best place<br />\nto study? It's quite simple, really. He studies there, and he's got<br />\nlike a 3.9 GPA, so it must work<br />\nfor him. And if it works for him,<br />\nit can work for you, too! So go<br />\non over there, knock on his door,<br />\nand ask him if you can study there<br />\nas well.

Unlike those<br />\nparadigms of power, like Sam<br />\nGoldwyn and David 0. Selznick,<br />\ntoday's movers and shakers are<br />\nmoving around a lot and are very<br />\nshaky. Executives are losing jobs<br />\nquickly, and moving from studio<br />\nto studio even quicker. And<br />\nstrategy has .changed: companies<br />\nbet on blockbuster movies to rake<br />\nin the profits and support the few<br />\n\"serious\" films they make.<br />\nWhile everyone tries to make<br />\nE. T. this leads to more<br />\nexpensive\u2014and more risky\u2014<br />\nprojects. After the failure of the<br />\nmega-expensive<br />\nHeaven's<br />\nGate, Universal Studios had to<br />\nclose.<br />\nSmaller, independent studios<br />\nare starting to emerge as new<br />\npowers in the movie industry.<br />\nNever a powerful force befcile,<br />\nthe Hollywood hierarchy is get-<br />\n<br />\nting mixed up as studios never<br />\nconsidered \"big\" are starting to<br />\ninfiltrate. Disney movies, written<br />\noff by Hollywooders as a cartoonfactory or a haven for Dean Jones<br />\nand Ken Berry, are back. With<br />\nTouchstone Films, Michael<br />\nEisner has put Disney on the map<br />\nin three years.<br />\nThe most startling and telling<br />\nrise is that of Cannon Pictures.<br />\nThe two-man team of GolamGlobus that started, runs, and<br />\nbasically is Cannon, has made the<br />\ncompany into the biggest independent on the movie scene.<br />\nWhat was only ten years ago a<br />\nthird-rate independent studio that<br />\nproduced dozens of low-budget<br />\nhack-and-slay horror flicks, is<br />\nnow signing contracts with<br />\nWalter Matthau, Roman Polanski, and Sylvester Stallone.<br />\nIn the forties, movie studios<br />\nowned a lot of their own movie<br />\ntheatres, so they had places to<br />\nshow the films and they got the<br />\n<br />\nextra revenue. The studios today<br />\ndon't do that. But Cannon did<br />\nthat. Cannon Group owns over 50<br />\nmovie theatres in Europe, making money for Cannon by showing Cannon films. A good<br />\nstrategy.<br />\nWhat movie studios also don't<br />\ndo today is make different kinds<br />\nof movies. As I said before,<br />\neveryone is trying to make<br />\nE.T. In the days of Sam<br />\nGoldwyn, studios had their<br />\ngangster films, their comedies,<br />\ntheir westerns, their musicals and<br />\ntheir serious films. Cannon alone<br />\nhas begun to go back to that old<br />\ntrend of spending less on movies<br />\nand expecting less of a return.<br />\nHowever, by targeting at specific<br />\naudiences, they are more assured<br />\nof the size profit they'll expect.<br />\nSo, while they still churn out<br />\nblood-and-gore flicks, they also<br />\nhave produced comedies (The<br />\nPrivate Eyes) and low-budget<br />\nserious films.<br />\n<br />\nCannon has started to attract<br />\nreal stars. Roman Polanski<br />\ndirected Pirates for them. The<br />\ncomedy-adventure, which starred<br />\nWalter Matthau, was a flop. But<br />\nnext year expect to see a Cannon<br />\nmovie directed by Matthau. The<br />\nmost talked about event in Cannon's history was their signing of<br />\nSylvester Stallone to star in<br />\nOver the Top. While they did<br />\nindeed pay Sly a hefty $12 million<br />\nto play the hero in this armwrestling epic, it's not overpriced considering Marlon Brando got the same amount for his<br />\ncameo in Superman. And<br />\nwhereas Brando's appearance as<br />\nSuperman's father added very little to the movie (Gene Hackman<br />\nstole the whole movie anyway),<br />\nStallone's name made this\u2014<br />\nCannon's first blockbuster<br />\nmovie\u2014profitable.<br />\nSure, Over the Top wasn't<br />\nanything like Cobra or Rambo. But with foreign distribu-<br />\n<br />\ntion, and video and cable rights,<br />\nCannon made nice money on the<br />\ndeal. So when you wonder who's<br />\ngoing to be producing the films<br />\nthat'll be winning the awards at<br />\nCannes in five years, it may be<br />\nCannon.<br />\nThe big Hollywood studios<br />\ncould learn a lot from those two<br />\nmiddle-aged Israelis. Like that<br />\naudiences don't all want to see<br />\nanother E.T.<br />\n<br />\nNote: On Media is an openforum<br />\nfor the Homewood community to<br />\nair their thoughts on T.

Send all<br />\narticles to the News-Letter, c/o<br />\nArts Editor.<br />\n<br />\nFlip Side<br />\nby Phil Gochenour<br />\nYou say you long for the days<br />\nof campus unrest, of real live 60's<br />\nkind of protests with Bob Dylan,<br />\nJoan Baez, and the Mamas and<br />\nthe Papas providing the<br />\nbackground music? Well then,<br />\nhave I got some albums for you.<br />\nThe first is Private Revolution<br />\n(Chrysalis Records) by World<br />\nParty, better known as former<br />\nWaterboys' sideman Karl Wallinger. Having come from a group<br />\nlike the Waterboys, who were<br />\nknown for their use of acoustic<br />\ninstruments, one expects Wallinger to lay some heavy folk-style<br />\ntunes on us. He's even wearing<br />\nLennon glasses on the cover! But<br />\nwhen the stylus hits the groove,<br />\nwe get something altogether different. Wallinger knows his way<br />\naround a pop tune, using all the<br />\ntricks of production to turn out a<br />\nsuperb study in songcraft. This is<br />\neven more impressive considering Wallinger produced this<br />\nalbum in his home. Of course,<br />\nthis isn't to say that we don't get<br />\nsome folky elements thrown in\u2014<br />\nthere is a credit for tabla and sitar<br />\nplaying, and the lyrics reflect a<br />\nheavy interest in conservation, as<br />\n<br />\nArts<br />\nFILM<br />\nWonderflix's<br />\nWeekend<br />\nwonderful showing of Out of<br />\nAfrica. It won the Oscar, so it's<br />\ngot to be good. Friday and Saturday at 8:00 and 10:15 p.m. in<br />\nShriver Hall.<br />\nThe animated fable Watership<br />\nDown is this week's presentation<br />\nfrom the Senior Class. Friday and<br />\nSaturday at 8:00 and 10:15 p.m.<br />\nin Shaffer 3.<br />\n<br />\nwell as a general disgust with<br />\nmaterialism. The World Party<br />\ntheme, as it were, is a song about<br />\nall the critters of the world getting<br />\ntogether everywhere having one big<br />\nshindy. Much to Wallinger's<br />\ncredit, all of this comes together<br />\nquite nicely, without being<br />\npreachy or whiny. The only real<br />\nproblem with this album is<br />\nWallinger\u2014primarily his vocals.<br />\nWhen I first heard \"Ship of<br />\nFools\" on the radio, I thought it<br />\nwas a new Mick Jagger single.<br />\nPerhaps this is Wallinger's way<br />\nof paying homage to a major influence, but it would be much<br />\nmore interesting to hear<br />\nsomething a bit more original.<br />\nThis isn't his natural voice\u2014on<br />\nhis cover of Bob Dylan's \"All I<br />\nReally Want to Do,\" he sounds<br />\nexactly like Dylan. It would seem<br />\nthat through the wonders of production, Wallinger is screwing<br />\nabout with the quality of his own<br />\nvoice. This is a good album, but<br />\nI have to give it a bad mark for<br />\nthis lack of originality. With<br />\nWallinger's considerable talent, it<br />\nseems a waste to just repeat what<br />\nhas been done before.<br />\nWhich brings us to Love Tractor, and their new album This<br />\nThe Reel World presents<br />\nRenoir's The Rules of the<br />\nGame. One of the greatest films<br />\nof the 1930's, and possibly the<br />\ncentury.

He was included in<br />\nLongman's anthology of contemporary poetry after publishing only two books. He has won awards<br />\nfrom the Prix de Rome to the<br />\nGuggenheim Eellowship. When<br />\nhe gave a reading Monday night<br />\nin the library's Garrett Room, it<br />\nwas well attended.<br />\nPeter Sacks introduced his colleague as a man whose work cut<br />\nnew paths, his stoic shearness, his<br />\nclear and simple lines showing<br />\nbeauty. After the lengthy and<br />\nlaudatory introduction, St. John<br />\ntook the podium and read some<br />\n<br />\nten poems. The poems showed<br />\nthat Sacks was right; St. John's<br />\npoems express a quiet power, a<br />\n\"hush\" (actually the title of one<br />\nof St. John's books). In the first<br />\npoem that he read, \"Terraces of<br />\nRain\", spoke of the five lands of<br />\nItaly, but he could have speaking<br />\nof his own work. For St. John's<br />\nwords are, like the terraces,<br />\n\"sheer terraces, rocks rising<br />\nstraight up from the sea.\" He<br />\nnoted that \"such country breaks<br />\nthe selfish heart.\" Well, such<br />\npoems break the selfish heart.<br />\nThe second poem, \"The<br />\nOrange Piano,\" used the word<br />\norange as a sad, longing color.<br />\nThe poem talks of an ex-concert<br />\npianist who now plays in a hotel<br />\nlounge. \"Only a truly fine career<br />\nis worth destroying,\" he says..<br />\n<br />\n\"Orange is the color of the<br />\nsoul\u2014no that's wrong\u2014orange is<br />\nthe color of the eccentric soul.\"<br />\nThe poet rewriting here is part of<br />\nthe uncertainty that slips into the<br />\npoem. That uncertainty shows up<br />\nagain when speaking of the<br />\npianist's father, who is the<br />\ngreatest teacher of Chopin\u2014\"and<br />\nalso, perhaps, Lizst.\"<br />\nThe rest of the poems were<br />\nfrom the collection No Heaven.<br />\nThe beautiful description of a<br />\ndrowned woman in \"A Hard and<br />\nNoble Patience\" mirrors St.<br />\nJohn's own poems.

Both culture and economy<br />\nare organizational terms of how<br />\nmembers of the defined group interrelate and choose to represent<br />\nthemselves. For example, artists<br />\nin general take their works to be<br />\nextensions of themselves,<br />\nmoneyed members expect their<br />\nhomes and lifestyles to reflect<br />\ntheir status, and statesmen project<br />\nthemselves as infallible and<br />\nbenevolent. Debora Silverman's<br />\nSelling Culture: Bloomingdale's,<br />\nDiana Vreeland, and the New<br />\nAristocracy of Taste in Reagan's<br />\nAmerica traces the relationship<br />\nbetween culture and economy<br />\nsince Reagan's ascendancy over<br />\nthe world's largest economy.<br />\n<br />\n\"A deeper correspondence (exists] between the political program of the Reagan White House<br />\nand the emergence , of an<br />\naristocratic consumer culture at<br />\nBloomingdale's [resulting ml a<br />\nstyle aggressively dedicated to the<br />\ncult of visible we&Ith and distinction, and to the illusion that they<br />\nwere well earned.\" At times,<br />\nSilverman's Selling Culture reads<br />\na little too seriously for an \"expose\" of a beau monde conspiracy; although every now and<br />\nthen it is humorous to imagine the<br />\nfashion industry secretly meeting<br />\nin Nancy Reagan's bedroom.<br />\nSilverman treats this cultural<br />\nhistory as a sell-out at the highest<br />\nlevels of power. She portrays a<br />\nsociety in which the extremely<br />\nclosest<br />\nAmerica's<br />\nrich,<br />\naristocrats, mold the culture for<br />\nthe vast majority of Americans.<br />\nMuch as Maxim Gorky observed a forced culture of the<br />\nAmerican middle and lower<br />\nclasses in the late nineteenth and<br />\nearly twentieth centuries, Silverman notes that American culture<br />\nis in the control of a handful of<br />\npeople. These people might not<br />\nmeet with each other regularly<br />\nand conspire, but they do keep<br />\ntabs on each other's actions. A<br />\nconsumerist elite thus emerges as<br />\nthe guiding force of American<br />\n<br />\ntaste. \"The dissolution of history<br />\nat the center of this aristocratic<br />\nconsumerist elite, and its political<br />\nmeaning and function, can be<br />\ntraced to 1980 through a series of<br />\nevents featuring a common cast of<br />\ncharacters and a shared set of<br />\nthemes. The year 1980 unfolds<br />\nlike a Chinese imperial triptych.<br />\nbeginning with Bloomingdale's,<br />\nreappearing at Vreeland's<br />\nMetropolitan Museum, and ending with Nancy Reagan's own<br />\nproject of redecorating the White<br />\nHouse.\u2022 *<br />\nDiana Vreeland, former<br />\nfashion consultant and editor of<br />\nVogue who is now historical consultant to the Metropolitan<br />\nMuseum's Costume Institute,<br />\norganized and sponsored various,<br />\nMuseum fashion exhibits featuring everything from gowns of<br />\nMarie Antionette to Mandarin<br />\nrobes to Yves Saint Laurent's<br />\ncurrent line. Aristocratic fanstasy<br />\nwas the theme of all her exhibits.<br />\n\"I adore artifice,\" she once<br />\nclaimed at a Vogue meeting.<br />\nSilverman links Vreeland's ostentatious and outrightly commercial<br />\nexhibits to Betsy Bloomingdale's<br />\ndepartment store empire; Bloomingdale's \"Baubles, Bangles, and<br />\nBedazzling Things of China\" and<br />\n\"Fetes de France\" selling themes<br />\nbizarrely parallel Vreeland's ex-<br />\n<br />\nLLLULLE<br />\nThe Serpent and the Rainbow<br />\nby Wade Davis<br />\nby Howell Sasser<br />\nThere is no doubt that<br />\nHollywood has a flair for the<br />\ndramatic: zombies meandering<br />\nthrough the night in search of<br />\nhuman flesh. Those bitten<br />\nbecome zombies themselves.<br />\nThis is the kind of stuff that<br />\nmakes eight and nine year olds<br />\ncheck the closet and under the bed<br />\nfor any sign of malevolent<br />\npresence. In 101 \"Living Dead\"<br />\npictures, the movies have<br />\npandered to our deepest fears surrounding death. If science can't<br />\nagree on what death is and when<br />\nit actually occurs, then maybe it<br />\nis never final, maybe people are<br />\nburied alive and we never even<br />\nknow it. With these questions, the<br />\nmovies betray the true-life origins<br />\nof their zombie shockers.<br />\nThe truth is that there really are<br />\nzombies, they really do die and<br />\nsubsequently rise from the grave,<br />\nand they really are the product of<br />\nvoodoo cults. However, the process surrounding the targeting<br />\nand making of zombies is far less<br />\nrandom than the movies would<br />\nhave us believe. The workings of<br />\ncomplex social and religious processes, altered and refined<br />\nthrough history, produce zombies, not an errant bite in the<br />\nnight. In The Serpent and the<br />\nRainbow, the author, an<br />\nethnobotanist.(whatever that is),<br />\ndocuments his search for the<br />\nchemicals used in zombification<br />\nand his subsequent field study of<br />\nthe secret societies and voodoo<br />\npriests (houngans) who make and<br />\nuse them.<br />\n<br />\nOver the course of three trips<br />\nto Haiti. Davis discovers that<br />\nsecret societies, descendants of<br />\nrebellious colonial slave gangs,<br />\noperate within the voodoo<br />\nreligion and alongside the official<br />\ncivil government. The societies<br />\npolice the night for criminals, and<br />\nthose found outside may be<br />\npunished. (In this context,<br />\nHollywood was right.) A society<br />\nmember who has a complaint<br />\nwith someone outside the society<br />\nmay \"sell\" him or her to a bokor<br />\n(a houngan who practices black<br />\nmagic), who, through the use of<br />\nmagic powders and spells. will be<br />\nable to \"kill\" the victim. Davis<br />\nis quick to point out that the<br />\nbokors. their clients and victims<br />\nbelieve that the bokors' powers<br />\nactually kill the victims and that<br />\nany subsequent resurrection can<br />\nonly be accomplished by the<br />\nbokors' magic.<br />\nDavis, skeptical of these<br />\nclaims, discovers otherwise.<br />\nLaboratory analyses of samples<br />\nof zombie poison show that it<br />\ncontains several psychoactive<br />\ndrugs which, in the correct doses,<br />\ncreate a death-like state. He goes<br />\non to cite similar, unintentional,<br />\noccurrences in Japan where, after<br />\neating the highly prized and<br />\nhighly poisonous blowfish known<br />\nas fugu, people appeared to<br />\n\"die,\" only to \"reawaken\" at<br />\ntheir own funerals. In reality,<br />\nthey were never dead, only completely paralyzed. So. in the Haitian case, if one adds the<br />\npsychological trauma of hearing<br />\noneself pronounced dead, and of<br />\nwitnessing one's own burial to the<br />\npopular beliefs related to the<br />\nmagic ability of voodoo priests to<br />\nmake people become sick and<br />\n<br />\ndie, Davis suggests that there is<br />\nlittle mystery to the existence of<br />\nzombies.<br />\nHaving dispensed with the<br />\nmeans of creation, Davis turns to<br />\nwhat is for him the more difficult<br />\nmatter of why zombies are made.<br />\nHe starts from the familiar cliche<br />\nabout evil priests and malevolent<br />\ngatherings choosing innocent victims and works his way through<br />\ninterviews with houngans and<br />\nsociety members, and eventually<br />\nattends some of their meetings.<br />\nThe upshot of it all is that the<br />\nsocieties do not simply choose<br />\nvictims at random, but rather<br />\ncontinue to function as courts for<br />\nsettling disputes, as their spiritual<br />\nancestors in Africa did. Rather<br />\nthan acting contrary to the good<br />\nof the community, the societies<br />\nact to protect the order and harmony of the community, settling<br />\nland disputes (a frequent problem) and family quarrels.<br />\nThis is the briefest summary of<br />\nthe general thrust of the book.<br />\nThere are so many small details<br />\nthat to say much more would require saying everything, an order<br />\nwhich the book takes 370 pages<br />\nto fill. In that time, it alternates<br />\nbetween biology and anthropology, giving equal weight<br />\nto each, and (thankfully) avoiding<br />\nthe worst verbal excesses of each.<br />\nWhile the descriptions of the<br />\npoisons often include lists of the<br />\nbiological names of the various<br />\nplants and animals used, they<br />\nnever went so far afield that an<br />\nalert reader could not keep them<br />\nmentally organized. By the same<br />\ntoken, there was little of the<br />\nsociological mumbo jumbo that<br />\ninfests some anthropology texts.<br />\n\u201e.\u201e<br />\n<br />\nNG<br />\n<br />\nJURE,<br />\n<br />\nhibits, resulting in a shocking malleable to the \"aristocratic\"<br />\nportrait of American consumer tastes of the economic and<br />\nelitist culture.

The<br />\nteam cannot seem to break the<br />\n420 stroke barrier and have a truly brilliant season; but instead,<br />\n,always finds that one score in the<br />\n90's that separates the average<br />\nteam from the prime time<br />\nperformer.<br />\nThe Whackers lost their home<br />\nopeners to Delaware and dropped<br />\nto 4-3, then placed fourth in the<br />\nWestern Maryland Invitational on<br />\nMonday to round off a week of<br />\nboring and mediocre golf.<br />\nThe team appears very tentative<br />\nand uncomfortable with the short<br />\ngame and putting, which explains<br />\nwhy it is not scoring well. Coach<br />\nO'Donnell held a special 'round<br />\nthe green' clinic which ought to<br />\ndrive down the scores at the<br />\nDickinson Invitational on Monday and at the MAC's next<br />\nweekend.<br />\nBlue Jays Choke Opener<br />\nThe Blue Jays met Deleware at<br />\nPine Ridge last Thursday, and<br />\nwhile a victory was only an outside shot, Delaware's 417 paved<br />\nthe way for a rousing Hopkins<br />\nupset. Instead, the home team<br />\nfans remained disappointed. The<br />\nWhackers shot 436 which included a 96 and failed to bridge the<br />\ncompetitive gap between country<br />\nclub and tournament golf.<br />\nJohnny Abrahams and Luigi<br />\nHanda led the dismal scoring with<br />\n86 and 85 respectively, each taking 40 putts. Luigi showed signs<br />\nof brilliance on the back nine with<br />\nan eagle on 13, but finished with<br />\nan 8 on 18 for a 38 on the<br />\nbackside. Abrahams, however,<br />\nremined consistently poor<br />\nthroughout his round, turning birdie opportunities into three putt<br />\nbogeys left and right.<br />\nNew kid in town Marc Quardt<br />\nwas the only breath of fresh air<br />\nfor Hopkins. Marc combined his<br />\nsexy haircut with an equally freeflowing and suave golf swing and<br />\nwent round in 82, at times making the game actually look easy.<br />\nMarc received praise from Coach<br />\nO'Donnell and seems likely to<br />\nmake the trip to the MAC's.<br />\nPaul Kadri posted his first sub90 score of the season, an 87,<br />\nwhich is encouraging given Mr.<br />\nKadri's heavy social schedule.<br />\nMr. Kadri's volleyball marathon<br />\nmay exclude him from several<br />\nmatches just when his game<br />\nseems to be on an upswing.<br />\nThe fifth score from Hopkins,<br />\na 96 by Grizzly Walutes, was the<br />\n<br />\nepitome of inconsistency and<br />\nslack golfing. Walutes probably<br />\nfelt the pressure playing against<br />\na Division One team, and his<br />\nabsence from competitive play<br />\nwhile doing time as the team<br />\nmascot didn't help either, but it<br />\nis the mark of a true champion to<br />\npull through against the odds, and<br />\nWalutes did not.<br />\nWestern Maryland Invitational<br />\nOn Monday the Whackers flew<br />\nto the Western Maryland Invitational in hopes of avenging their<br />\nlackadaisical performance against<br />\nDelaware but found themselves<br />\nmired in increasing mediocrity.<br />\nIf it wasn't one thing, it was<br />\nanother. While both Jon Thompson and Grizzly Walutes broke<br />\n90, Todd Stefan bloated to a 92,<br />\nand the team's total of 426 placed them fourth out of six teams.<br />\nGettysburg emerged eventual<br />\nwinners with 408, not a great<br />\nscore on this pitch and putt<br />\ncourse. This was the same team<br />\nthe Jays nipped at Gettysburg a<br />\nmere ten days ago.<br />\nAbrahams, as hehas so often<br />\nthis season, lead the linksters with<br />\nan 80 but still putted 40 times.<br />\nLuigi Handa followed close<br />\nbehind on 82, these low scores<br />\nbeing indicative of the easy<br />\ncourse rather than any exceptional golfing on the parts of the<br />\nHopkins nos. 1 and 2.<br />\nStefan's inconsistent play remains a mystery, although he<br />\nhasn't been able to practice due<br />\nto the MCATs coming up shortly. Coach O'Donnell will work<br />\nwith Todd on the practice tee and<br />\nhelp him regain tempo and confidence, key ingredients to the<br />\nsuccessful execution of the game.<br />\nOther Blue Jay competitors<br />\nwere Steve Schiller (93) still<br />\nhungover after his first job offer,<br />\nand the lefthander Bill Rica (96).<br />\nMAC Playoff<br />\nThis week's schedule is<br />\nhighlighted by the intra-squad<br />\ntourney today to decide who will<br />\nrepresent the Whackers at the<br />\nMAC's next weekend.<br />\nThis is the first time Coach<br />\nO'Donnell has introduced such a<br />\nsystem of qualification and it is<br />\ndesigned to make the players<br />\ntournament tough. Today's playoff will be shrouded with tension<br />\nas upsets can occur quite readily. No doubt the fans will be out<br />\nin numbers rooting for the local<br />\nfavorite, the flamboyant Jack<br />\nSavits, whose peculiar style of hit<br />\nand run golf is particularly suited<br />\nto this situation.<br />\n<br />\nGeorge the Greek<br />\nFt<br />\n<br />\nstatu ra nt<br />\n<br />\nGreek \u2022 Italian \u2022 American<br />\nSpecials everyday<br />\ncarry out<br />\ncatering & party trays .<br />\nseating upstairs & downstairs<br />\n627 N.

It was<br />\na disheartening loss for the lady<br />\nlaxers and abolished their<br />\nchances for an N.C.A.A. bid this<br />\nyear. Nevertheless, the lady laxers' determination even in the last<br />\nminutes of the game was commendable. \"This team doesn't<br />\ngive up,\" says Head Coach Sally Anderson,\"We got started late<br />\nand ran out of time. Usually, the<br />\nteam starts out strongly, but<br />\nbecause of the importance of the<br />\ngame, the team was scared.\" The<br />\nLady Jays' tentative first half led<br />\nto an 11-5 deficit at halftime. In<br />\nthe second half, however, the<br />\nLady Jays outplayed Western<br />\nMaryland 6-5. The momentum<br />\nhad changed. Spectacular<br />\ngoalkeeping from Laura Porter<br />\n(13 saves in the second half) as<br />\nwell as strong defensive. efforts<br />\n<br />\nfrom Julie Siegrist and Jen Stahl<br />\nkept Western Maryland's strong,<br />\nquick, and well-balanced attack in<br />\nlow gear. Freshman Julie Siegrist<br />\nheld Western Maryland's leading<br />\nscorer to only 2 goals, and Jen<br />\nStahl's move to defensive wing<br />\ncompletely shut down the scoring<br />\nfrom Western Maryland's speedy<br />\nattack wing.<br />\nThe game fell apart in the midfield. The attack had been averaged about 25 shots in the first half<br />\nof their games. This game there<br />\nwere only 10 shots (5 of which<br />\nwere goals). The midfield connection just was not there to get<br />\nthe ball to the attack.<br />\nThe Lady Jays are still hoping<br />\nfor a shot at the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference Championship.<br />\nShould Western Maryland lose to<br />\n<br />\nGettysburg next Wednesday, the<br />\nWest division would then have a<br />\nthree-way tie for first place, and<br />\nHopkins might be able to sneak<br />\nin the back door to the MAC<br />\nfinals.

She<br />\nadded that the Coalition had initially \"consented to indefinite<br />\ncontinuance of the injunction.\"<br />\nCoalition spokesman Paul<br />\nsaid that when Coalition<br />\nGenest<br />\nJohn Misa<br />\nSteven David, assistant professor of political science and coordinator of members agreed to the contithe international studies program, who discussed his perspectives on in- nuance, \"the Coalition did not<br />\nternational politics at Sunday's Homewood lecture.<br /><br />\nhave counsel present, \"and that<br />\nCoalition members Patrick Bond<br />\nand Michael Johns \"felt they had<br />\nbeen somewhat misled by counsel<br />\nfor the University\" about the<br />\nlegal implications of such an<br />\nagreement.<br />\nShortly before the Academic<br />\nCouncil meeting, according to V.<br />\nDavid VandeLinde, dean of the<br />\nG.W.C.

Dr. Steven David,<br />\nassociate professor of political<br />\nscience, was invited by the Student Council to present the lecture, which was created to honor<br />\na member of the faculty who has<br />\ndone much to help the<br />\nundergraduates at Hopkins.<br />\nThe lecture was presented in a<br />\nmanner unlike the format adhered<br />\nto by former honorees. Before<br />\nDavid spoke, there was a picnic<br />\nin his honor. David mingled with<br /><br />\nthe students on the steps of<br />\nGilman. Rain then forced the<br />\ncelebration to be moved to the<br />\nGarrett Room of MSE, where<br />\nDavid presented an informal and<br />\ninformative discussion.<br />\nDavid began by providing a little insight into his philosophy in<br />\nhis classroom and various events<br />\nin his life that may have shaped<br />\nhis perspective on international<br />\npolitics.<br />\nHe considers himself fairly<br />\nconservative in terms of the international arena. He explained,<br />\n\"As bad as the U.S. may be, the<br />\nrest of the world is a lot worse.\"<br />\nDavid discussed war in the con-<br /><br />\ntext of international policy<br />\nchoices. Although war is a ternble thing, he said, there are<br />\n\"worse things than war.\" He explained that he sees a strong<br />\ndefense as essential for the United<br />\nStates. \"I would rather err on the<br />\nside of being overprepared rather<br />\nthan less prepared.\"<br />\nAccording to David, the U.S.<br />\nmust always be on its guard. In<br />\nhis opinion, isolationism is \"a<br />\nchoice but not an escape.\"<br />\nDavid went on to discuss the<br />\noften noticeable divergence between the people of a country and<br />\nits government. He recounted a<br />\nnumber of occurrences during his<br /><br />\nStatement on Free Expression<br />\nPresented to Student Council<br />\nby Tom McNamara<br />\nAt Wednesday's Student Council meeting, President Mark<br />\nKomisky distributed a draft of a<br />\nstatement on freedom of expression. He said that the document<br />\nwas compiled from statements<br />\ngiven to him by Buildings and<br />\nGrounds Chairman Jim Finnerty<br />\nand Sophomore Class Representative Susan Land.<br />\nCouncil has not yet voted on<br />\nwhat is to be done with the draft,<br />\nalthough Komisky has asked for<br />\nhelp in preparing another version<br />\nfor presentation at the next<br />\nmeeting.<br />\nKomisky said that the draft<br />\nrepresents \"a sort of comprehensive memo\" to the Hopkins community on the subject. According<br />\nto its introduction, the \"statement<br /><br />\nis by no means to be a definitive<br />\nwork on freedom of expression<br />\nbut rather is to serve as a basis for<br />\nfurther discourse on the issue.\"<br />\nThe memo includes the claim<br />\nthat the \"Flathman Report\"<br />\nissued by the University's Committee on Freedom of Expression<br />\n\"leans toward the notion of an<br />\nabsolute freedom, however,<br />\ndiscussion among many members<br />\nof the Hopkins community has<br />\npointed toward the need for further investigation.\"<br />\nThe memo consists of seven<br />\npoints, covering a broad range of<br />\nissues related to fieedom of expression. It defines a \"legitimate<br />\nact of free expression\" as \"any<br />\nact intended by the agent to communicate to other persons some<br />\nproposition, position, attitude,<br />\netc., with significance to a<br /><br />\ngenerality of interest.

The University responded quickly by obtaining a court injunction prohibiting such structures. The names of four<br />\nactive Coalition members were specifically mentioned in the injunction.<br />\nOn September 29, the Coalition built<br />\nanother shanty in defiance of the injunction.<br />\nOn that ignoble day, fourteen shantybuilders were arrested.

If it<br />\nis known to the average, even<br />\nwell-educated family member, it<br />\nis known for the medical school.<br />\nEven as it is working on a<br />\nmassive fund-raising effort,<br />\nHopkins does not have the reputation it deserves. Sure enough, the<br />\nHomewood campus itself is not<br />\nimpressive, lacking the size of<br />\nmost, and the single monumental<br />\nbuilding of almost all other top<br />\nschools. Perhaps it is a simple<br />\nreaction to this, that the school<br />\ncalls itself THE Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity, as if to distinguish<br />\nitself from others of the same<br />\nname.<br />\nThe founding of Hopkins set it<br />\napart immediately. Unlike Harvard, it was not a college first, a<br />\nUnlike<br />\nlater.<br />\nuniversity<br />\nMichigan, it did not have the<br />\nbenefits of being a land-grant<br />\nuniversity. Instead, it followed<br />\nthe German model from the start,<br />\ninnovative, if oppressive, coming<br />\ninto being as two institutions, the<br />\nschool, and the medical<br />\ninstitutions.<br />\nAs higher education is called<br />\nupon to reform itself(even if only by a government administration known for introducing partisan bias into all situations),<br />\nHopkins should take a look at<br />\nitself, for its problems are not<br />\nmerely those of publicity and<br />\nfame.<br />\nAs far as undergraduate education goes, the underlying problem<br />\nis of internal division. The branches of the University are<br />\nsegregated, as are the academic<br />\ndisciplines, the sexes, and the<br />\ncommunity.<br />\nWhile the China program, the<br />\nMontgomery County project, and<br />\nthe downtown center are worthy,<br />\nit is odd that so much less emphasis is placed on the<br />\nHomewood campus, and providing a college education. It is<br />\nnot a matter of too many graduate<br />\nprograms; it is a matter of too few<br />\nundergraduate counterparts. The<br />\nschool may have been better off<br />\ngiving up undergraduate education altogether, as it considered in<br />\nthe Twenties.<br /><br />\nThe non-science departments<br />\nare not weak, but their reputations are. Even those that are nationally known, such as English,<br />\nHistory, and Writing Seminars,<br />\nare not respected on-campus. The<br />\nscientific bent is not just an attitude problem on the part of<br />\nstudents. It is a circular, systemic<br />\nproblem. The library has an appalling lack of literature, the<br />\nhumanities departments have the<br />\nworst accomodations, and there is<br />\na lack of innovative interdepartmental programs. There<br />\nwere no women's studies until<br />\nthis year. There are still no<br />\nethnic, science and culture, or introductory writing programs.<br />\nThe sex-balance problem has<br />\nbeen documented, discussed, and<br />\nforgotten. It exists at other<br />\nschools, but it's worse here. The<br />\nsame applies with minority administrators and faculty. An additional disadvantage at Hopkins<br />\nis the infamous \"ratio\" amongst<br />\nstudents. The two-to-one malefemale distribution does no end of<br />\nharm toward the development of<br />\nstudents as responsible adults. It's<br />\nsimply a bad thing.<br />\nThe ratio is but a part of the<br />\nsocial life at Hopkins. The rest of<br />\nit is equally unsettling. It is often<br />\nsaid that social life exists at<br />\nHopkins, but like other aspects of<br />\nthe school, must be sought out.<br />\npursued with vigour. There is<br />\nnothing wrong with a challenge.<br />\nThere is, however, no need to<br />\nmake life unnecessarily difficult.<br />\nThe University's contribution<br />\nto the community is a lack of one.<br />\nThis is most unfortunate with<br />\nrespect to housing. It may well be<br />\nthat the situation at Hopkins<br />\nmakes for more adult-like<br />\nbehavior, but that's unlikely, and<br />\na weak excuse, for when the administration speaks of community it ignores its own creation of<br />\na fragmented non-community,<br />\nscattered off-campus.<br />\nIt has been said that we are the<br />\nchildren who were picked last for<br />\nkickball, who played \"Dungeons<br />\nand Dragons\" in gifted programs, who are Ivy-League rejects.

Indeed, the Course Guide<br />\nhas previously been called \"the<br />\nmost _vital publication on campus\" and though you might<br />\ndisagree with this, if you're an<br />\nundergraduate at Hopkins, you<br />\nare almost sure to have been<br />\nfound madly skimming the<br />\nCourse Guide reviews for just<br />\nthat right class at one time or<br />\nanother.

Secondly, I want<br />\nto make the sad report that,<br />\nagainst every grain of decency<br />\nand sanity, some obnoxious, uptight individual scratched the side<br />\nof the Blue Shark with a key after<br />\nthe appearance of last week's column. I'd narrowed the list of<br /><br />\nsuspects down to a few possible<br />\nindividuals, but then realized,<br />\n\"Who had the greatest motivation<br />\nto perpetrate this senseless act of<br />\nviolence?? Who, in a fit ofjealous<br />\nrage at not having his car named<br />\nBest at Hopkins, would lash out<br />\nat an innocent Volvo??\" It had to<br />\nbe the owner of that obnoxious<br />\nyellow Toyota with the ugly<br />\nyellow-on-blue license plates.<br />\nI would also like to make a<br />\ncomment that I resisted the im-<br /><br />\nBruce and Dave, hitting the. .bottle?<br /><br />\npulse to follow last week's lead<br />\nand write a column about the Best<br />\nApartment at Hopkins, or worse<br />\nyet, the Best Weekly Column at<br />\nHopkins. In any case, here's today's article, a subject near and<br />\ndear to every Hopkins student<br />\nalive. . .<br />\nWhere to go to study? Just two<br />\nweeks ago I had an amazing test<br />\nin History of the Earth and Its<br />\nBiota, which, incidently, is a nice<br />\nway to earn those N credits. So<br />\nanyway, I was about a month<br />\nbehind in the reading, and needed a quiet place to relax and open<br />\nup to Chapter 9 of Earth and Life<br />\nThrough Time, written, incredibly, by the professor<br />\nhimself. Don't you hate it when<br />\nthe prof has written the book<br />\nyou're using in the course? You<br />\ncan say to him, \"Excuse me, sir,<br />\nI have a different interpretation. I<br />\ndon't think the author meant<br />\nthat,\" to which the prof will reply, \"Yes I did.\" What a burden.<br />\nSo anyway, I couldn't think of<br />\na good place to study. What were<br />\nmy choices? Well, the most obvious choice is the library. It's not<br />\na bad place to study, but it's so<br />\nobvious. Everyone studies there.<br />\nYou can go into the reserve<br />\nroom, but don't you dare open<br />\nyour mouth, even to breathe, lest<br />\nsome vicious, obnoxious<br />\nemployee trying to make up for<br />\na bad chiLlhood wiii bellow.<br /><br />\nAVIA<br />\n.<br /><br />\n0<br />\n.<br />\n.1<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\n.......<br /><br />\n^<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nVenkl %4.tA *.<br />\n;<br />\n\u2022<br />\nArt''!'\" \u2022 \u2022\u2022<br />\n. \u2022 \u2022 -.\u2022\u2022.<br /><br />\nto<br /><br />\n\"QUIET, YOU FOOL!!!\" two<br />\ninches in front of your face. In<br />\naddition, I was once standing by<br />\nthe elevators on M-Level talking<br />\nto someone, and this enormously wide man came shuffling up<br />\nand told us that if we didn't shut<br />\nup he would sit on us. I was,<br />\nneedless to say, traumatized by<br />\nthe incident, and consequently<br />\nhaven't been able to eat since, so<br />\nthe library is definitely out.<br />\nWell, where then? There are<br />\nother possibilities. You can go up<br />\nto the roof of Wolman with a<br />\nflashlight. This is not so bad. You<br />\ncould go out to the Loch Raven<br />\nReservoir (this is my favorite\u2014<br />\nthe Shark loves the country) and<br />\nbe one with nature. You could go<br />\ninto the waiting room at Union<br />\nMemorial and open your books.<br />\nThis is one of my personal<br />\nfavorites. The place is equipped.<br />\nIt's got two TV's, comfortable<br />\nchairs, and lots of pretty nurses<br />\nto stare at and make uncomfortable in case you get bored. Only<br />\ntrouble is, if you stay there long<br />\nenough to read 8 chapters in<br />\nEarth and Life Through Time<br />\n(believe me, it takes a long time)<br />\nwithout grabbing your chest or<br />\nbleeding all over the place, they'll<br />\nprobably get suspicious and<br />\nthrow you out.<br />\nhow aoout on top of the<br />\nlibrary? You could go up there<br />\nearly in the morning, set up your<br />\n0.4.1.43 \\.i .4740iS<br />\n'<br /><br />\nStudy<br />\nbooks to study, and hang a banner off the ledge which reads<br />\nsomething like JHU + MSE =<br />\nDeath Factory.\" Oh wait, I'm<br />\nsorry. It's already been done.<br />\nNo, the Best Place to Study at<br />\nHopkins is someplace completely unexpected. It's on the third<br />\nfloor of the rowhouse at 3203 St.<br />\nPaul Street. Why here, of all<br />\nplaces? Well, it's obvious. For the<br />\nthird floor of said rowhouse is the<br />\nhome of my roommate from<br />\nfreshman year, David Scott Battleman. How do I arrive at the<br />\nfact that his room is the best place<br />\nto study? It's quite simple, really. He studies there, and he's got<br />\nlike a 3.9 GPA, so it must work<br />\nfor him. And if it works for him,<br />\nit can work for you, too! So go<br />\non over there, knock on his door,<br />\nand ask him if you can study there<br />\nas well. He's a great guy, and<br />\nwould love to have the company,<br />\nso why not do it? Let's see if we<br />\ncan't get the whole shootin'<br />\nmatch up there at once. Whaddaya say, Big Guy?? The whole<br />\nschool's waitin' on an answer!<br />\n(Also, when you go over there,<br />\nif it's past about 1 a.m., he'll be<br />\nthere, but in his peculiar position,<br />\ni.e., lying on his bed with his<br />\nnotebook open in front of him, his<br />\nglasses on his face, fast asleep<br />\nand snoring loudiy.

Unlike those<br />\nparadigms of power, like Sam<br />\nGoldwyn and David 0. Selznick,<br />\ntoday's movers and shakers are<br />\nmoving around a lot and are very<br />\nshaky. Executives are losing jobs<br />\nquickly, and moving from studio<br />\nto studio even quicker. And<br />\nstrategy has .changed: companies<br />\nbet on blockbuster movies to rake<br />\nin the profits and support the few<br />\n\"serious\" films they make.<br />\nWhile everyone tries to make<br />\nE. T. this leads to more<br />\nexpensive\u2014and more risky\u2014<br />\nprojects. After the failure of the<br />\nmega-expensive<br />\nHeaven's<br />\nGate, Universal Studios had to<br />\nclose.<br />\nSmaller, independent studios<br />\nare starting to emerge as new<br />\npowers in the movie industry.<br />\nNever a powerful force befcile,<br />\nthe Hollywood hierarchy is get-<br /><br />\nting mixed up as studios never<br />\nconsidered \"big\" are starting to<br />\ninfiltrate. Disney movies, written<br />\noff by Hollywooders as a cartoonfactory or a haven for Dean Jones<br />\nand Ken Berry, are back. With<br />\nTouchstone Films, Michael<br />\nEisner has put Disney on the map<br />\nin three years.<br />\nThe most startling and telling<br />\nrise is that of Cannon Pictures.<br />\nThe two-man team of GolamGlobus that started, runs, and<br />\nbasically is Cannon, has made the<br />\ncompany into the biggest independent on the movie scene.<br />\nWhat was only ten years ago a<br />\nthird-rate independent studio that<br />\nproduced dozens of low-budget<br />\nhack-and-slay horror flicks, is<br />\nnow signing contracts with<br />\nWalter Matthau, Roman Polanski, and Sylvester Stallone.<br />\nIn the forties, movie studios<br />\nowned a lot of their own movie<br />\ntheatres, so they had places to<br />\nshow the films and they got the<br /><br />\nextra revenue. The studios today<br />\ndon't do that. But Cannon did<br />\nthat. Cannon Group owns over 50<br />\nmovie theatres in Europe, making money for Cannon by showing Cannon films. A good<br />\nstrategy.<br />\nWhat movie studios also don't<br />\ndo today is make different kinds<br />\nof movies. As I said before,<br />\neveryone is trying to make<br />\nE.T. In the days of Sam<br />\nGoldwyn, studios had their<br />\ngangster films, their comedies,<br />\ntheir westerns, their musicals and<br />\ntheir serious films. Cannon alone<br />\nhas begun to go back to that old<br />\ntrend of spending less on movies<br />\nand expecting less of a return.<br />\nHowever, by targeting at specific<br />\naudiences, they are more assured<br />\nof the size profit they'll expect.<br />\nSo, while they still churn out<br />\nblood-and-gore flicks, they also<br />\nhave produced comedies (The<br />\nPrivate Eyes) and low-budget<br />\nserious films.<br /><br />\nCannon has started to attract<br />\nreal stars. Roman Polanski<br />\ndirected Pirates for them. The<br />\ncomedy-adventure, which starred<br />\nWalter Matthau, was a flop. But<br />\nnext year expect to see a Cannon<br />\nmovie directed by Matthau. The<br />\nmost talked about event in Cannon's history was their signing of<br />\nSylvester Stallone to star in<br />\nOver the Top. While they did<br />\nindeed pay Sly a hefty $12 million<br />\nto play the hero in this armwrestling epic, it's not overpriced considering Marlon Brando got the same amount for his<br />\ncameo in Superman. And<br />\nwhereas Brando's appearance as<br />\nSuperman's father added very little to the movie (Gene Hackman<br />\nstole the whole movie anyway),<br />\nStallone's name made this\u2014<br />\nCannon's first blockbuster<br />\nmovie\u2014profitable.<br />\nSure, Over the Top wasn't<br />\nanything like Cobra or Rambo. But with foreign distribu-<br /><br />\ntion, and video and cable rights,<br />\nCannon made nice money on the<br />\ndeal. So when you wonder who's<br />\ngoing to be producing the films<br />\nthat'll be winning the awards at<br />\nCannes in five years, it may be<br />\nCannon.<br />\nThe big Hollywood studios<br />\ncould learn a lot from those two<br />\nmiddle-aged Israelis.

Well then,<br />\nhave I got some albums for you.<br />\nThe first is Private Revolution<br />\n(Chrysalis Records) by World<br />\nParty, better known as former<br />\nWaterboys' sideman Karl Wallinger.

He's even wearing<br />\nLennon glasses on the cover! But<br />\nwhen the stylus hits the groove,<br />\nwe get something altogether different. Wallinger knows his way<br />\naround a pop tune, using all the<br />\ntricks of production to turn out a<br />\nsuperb study in songcraft.

Much to Wallinger's<br />\ncredit, all of this comes together<br />\nquite nicely, without being<br />\npreachy or whiny. The only real<br />\nproblem with this album is<br />\nWallinger\u2014primarily his vocals.<br />\nWhen I first heard \"Ship of<br />\nFools\" on the radio, I thought it<br />\nwas a new Mick Jagger single.<br />\nPerhaps this is Wallinger's way<br />\nof paying homage to a major influence, but it would be much<br />\nmore interesting to hear<br />\nsomething a bit more original.<br />\nThis isn't his natural voice\u2014on<br />\nhis cover of Bob Dylan's \"All I<br />\nReally Want to Do,\" he sounds<br />\nexactly like Dylan.

This is a good album, but<br />\nI have to give it a bad mark for<br />\nthis lack of originality.

He was included in<br />\nLongman's anthology of contemporary poetry after publishing only two books. He has won awards<br />\nfrom the Prix de Rome to the<br />\nGuggenheim Eellowship.

After the lengthy and<br />\nlaudatory introduction, St. John<br />\ntook the podium and read some<br /><br />\nten poems. The poems showed<br />\nthat Sacks was right; St. John's<br />\npoems express a quiet power, a<br />\n\"hush\" (actually the title of one<br />\nof St. John's books). In the first<br />\npoem that he read, \"Terraces of<br />\nRain\", spoke of the five lands of<br />\nItaly, but he could have speaking<br />\nof his own work. For St. John's<br />\nwords are, like the terraces,<br />\n\"sheer terraces, rocks rising<br />\nstraight up from the sea.\" He<br />\nnoted that \"such country breaks<br />\nthe selfish heart.\" Well, such<br />\npoems break the selfish heart.<br />\nThe second poem, \"The<br />\nOrange Piano,\" used the word<br />\norange as a sad, longing color.<br />\nThe poem talks of an ex-concert<br />\npianist who now plays in a hotel<br />\nlounge. \"Only a truly fine career<br />\nis worth destroying,\" he says..<br /><br />\n\"Orange is the color of the<br />\nsoul\u2014no that's wrong\u2014orange is<br />\nthe color of the eccentric soul.\"<br />\nThe poet rewriting here is part of<br />\nthe uncertainty that slips into the<br />\npoem.

He concludes that \"only one belief remains for a man whose faith remains more insupportable than<br />\nair.\"<br />\nPoems are not economy of<br />\nlanguage, they are economy of<br />\nthought. If St. John's poems were<br />\nshortened they would lose the imagery, the power, the thought.<br />\nWhether describing gloves which<br />\nare \"my noose of leather\" or a<br />\nwoman \"laughing so hard she<br />\nwas almost bent over, almost cry-<br /><br />\ning, I think, crying.\" St. John's<br />\nlanguage carries one away.<br />\nBut he also has a strong feel for<br />\nthe narrative, as in \"Chapter<br />\nForever\" or \"The Man in the<br />\nYellow Gloves.\" \"His gloves of<br />\ntouch water or liquid or any sort\"<br />\nare the gloves worn by a poet.<br />\nBeneath the gloves lay burnt<br />\nhands, the ugliness hidden<br />\nbeneath the beauty.

Soundtrack by the<br />\nFine Young Cannibals.<br />\nThe problem with Tin Men is<br />\nits predictability. Barry Levinson<br />\nhas attempted yet another remake<br />\nof American Graffitti for the age<br />\nof MTV and the VCR. The plot<br />\nand camera work unfold like a<br />\nremake of \"The Odd Couple\"<br />\nspliced onto a \"Haircut 100\"<br />\nvideo.

Hershey<br />\nis a very resourceful actress,<br />\nhowever. Her last scene with<br />\nDeVito involves a particularly<br />\ndifficult mixture of sensitivity and<br /><br />\naggression. It is a pleasure to<br />\nwatch a talented actress at work.<br />\nA more obvious reason to see<br />\nTin Men is its setting. Baltimore<br />\nhas a very characteristic box-like<br />\nquality on film. The city is not<br />\npretty, but even with the kind of<br />\nuninspired cinematography that<br />\nwent into this movie, it appears<br />\ncompelling.

Both culture and economy<br />\nare organizational terms of how<br />\nmembers of the defined group interrelate and choose to represent<br />\nthemselves. For example, artists<br />\nin general take their works to be<br />\nextensions of themselves,<br />\nmoneyed members expect their<br />\nhomes and lifestyles to reflect<br />\ntheir status, and statesmen project<br />\nthemselves as infallible and<br />\nbenevolent. Debora Silverman's<br />\nSelling Culture: Bloomingdale's,<br />\nDiana Vreeland, and the New<br />\nAristocracy of Taste in Reagan's<br />\nAmerica traces the relationship<br />\nbetween culture and economy<br />\nsince Reagan's ascendancy over<br />\nthe world's largest economy.<br /><br />\n\"A deeper correspondence (exists] between the political program of the Reagan White House<br />\nand the emergence , of an<br />\naristocratic consumer culture at<br />\nBloomingdale's [resulting ml a<br />\nstyle aggressively dedicated to the<br />\ncult of visible we&amp;Ith and distinction, and to the illusion that they<br />\nwere well earned.\" At times,<br />\nSilverman's Selling Culture reads<br />\na little too seriously for an \"expose\" of a beau monde conspiracy; although every now and<br />\nthen it is humorous to imagine the<br />\nfashion industry secretly meeting<br />\nin Nancy Reagan's bedroom.<br />\nSilverman treats this cultural<br />\nhistory as a sell-out at the highest<br />\nlevels of power. She portrays a<br />\nsociety in which the extremely<br />\nclosest<br />\nAmerica's<br />\nrich,<br />\naristocrats, mold the culture for<br />\nthe vast majority of Americans.<br />\nMuch as Maxim Gorky observed a forced culture of the<br />\nAmerican middle and lower<br />\nclasses in the late nineteenth and<br />\nearly twentieth centuries, Silverman notes that American culture<br />\nis in the control of a handful of<br />\npeople. These people might not<br />\nmeet with each other regularly<br />\nand conspire, but they do keep<br />\ntabs on each other's actions. A<br />\nconsumerist elite thus emerges as<br />\nthe guiding force of American<br /><br />\ntaste. \"The dissolution of history<br />\nat the center of this aristocratic<br />\nconsumerist elite, and its political<br />\nmeaning and function, can be<br />\ntraced to 1980 through a series of<br />\nevents featuring a common cast of<br />\ncharacters and a shared set of<br />\nthemes. The year 1980 unfolds<br />\nlike a Chinese imperial triptych.<br />\nbeginning with Bloomingdale's,<br />\nreappearing at Vreeland's<br />\nMetropolitan Museum, and ending with Nancy Reagan's own<br />\nproject of redecorating the White<br />\nHouse.\u2022 *<br />\nDiana Vreeland, former<br />\nfashion consultant and editor of<br />\nVogue who is now historical consultant to the Metropolitan<br />\nMuseum's Costume Institute,<br />\norganized and sponsored various,<br />\nMuseum fashion exhibits featuring everything from gowns of<br />\nMarie Antionette to Mandarin<br />\nrobes to Yves Saint Laurent's<br />\ncurrent line. Aristocratic fanstasy<br />\nwas the theme of all her exhibits.<br />\n\"I adore artifice,\" she once<br />\nclaimed at a Vogue meeting.<br />\nSilverman links Vreeland's ostentatious and outrightly commercial<br />\nexhibits to Betsy Bloomingdale's<br />\ndepartment store empire; Bloomingdale's \"Baubles, Bangles, and<br />\nBedazzling Things of China\" and<br />\n\"Fetes de France\" selling themes<br />\nbizarrely parallel Vreeland's ex-<br /><br />\nLLLULLE<br />\nThe Serpent and the Rainbow<br />\nby Wade Davis<br />\nby Howell Sasser<br />\nThere is no doubt that<br />\nHollywood has a flair for the<br />\ndramatic: zombies meandering<br />\nthrough the night in search of<br />\nhuman flesh. Those bitten<br />\nbecome zombies themselves.<br />\nThis is the kind of stuff that<br />\nmakes eight and nine year olds<br />\ncheck the closet and under the bed<br />\nfor any sign of malevolent<br />\npresence. In 101 \"Living Dead\"<br />\npictures, the movies have<br />\npandered to our deepest fears surrounding death. If science can't<br />\nagree on what death is and when<br />\nit actually occurs, then maybe it<br />\nis never final, maybe people are<br />\nburied alive and we never even<br />\nknow it. With these questions, the<br />\nmovies betray the true-life origins<br />\nof their zombie shockers.<br />\nThe truth is that there really are<br />\nzombies, they really do die and<br />\nsubsequently rise from the grave,<br />\nand they really are the product of<br />\nvoodoo cults. However, the process surrounding the targeting<br />\nand making of zombies is far less<br />\nrandom than the movies would<br />\nhave us believe. The workings of<br />\ncomplex social and religious processes, altered and refined<br />\nthrough history, produce zombies, not an errant bite in the<br />\nnight. In The Serpent and the<br />\nRainbow, the author, an<br />\nethnobotanist.(whatever that is),<br />\ndocuments his search for the<br />\nchemicals used in zombification<br />\nand his subsequent field study of<br />\nthe secret societies and voodoo<br />\npriests (houngans) who make and<br />\nuse them.<br /><br />\nOver the course of three trips<br />\nto Haiti. Davis discovers that<br />\nsecret societies, descendants of<br />\nrebellious colonial slave gangs,<br />\noperate within the voodoo<br />\nreligion and alongside the official<br />\ncivil government. The societies<br />\npolice the night for criminals, and<br />\nthose found outside may be<br />\npunished. (In this context,<br />\nHollywood was right.) A society<br />\nmember who has a complaint<br />\nwith someone outside the society<br />\nmay \"sell\" him or her to a bokor<br />\n(a houngan who practices black<br />\nmagic), who, through the use of<br />\nmagic powders and spells. will be<br />\nable to \"kill\" the victim. Davis<br />\nis quick to point out that the<br />\nbokors. their clients and victims<br />\nbelieve that the bokors' powers<br />\nactually kill the victims and that<br />\nany subsequent resurrection can<br />\nonly be accomplished by the<br />\nbokors' magic.<br />\nDavis, skeptical of these<br />\nclaims, discovers otherwise.<br />\nLaboratory analyses of samples<br />\nof zombie poison show that it<br />\ncontains several psychoactive<br />\ndrugs which, in the correct doses,<br />\ncreate a death-like state. He goes<br />\non to cite similar, unintentional,<br />\noccurrences in Japan where, after<br />\neating the highly prized and<br />\nhighly poisonous blowfish known<br />\nas fugu, people appeared to<br />\n\"die,\" only to \"reawaken\" at<br />\ntheir own funerals. In reality,<br />\nthey were never dead, only completely paralyzed. So. in the Haitian case, if one adds the<br />\npsychological trauma of hearing<br />\noneself pronounced dead, and of<br />\nwitnessing one's own burial to the<br />\npopular beliefs related to the<br />\nmagic ability of voodoo priests to<br />\nmake people become sick and<br /><br />\ndie, Davis suggests that there is<br />\nlittle mystery to the existence of<br />\nzombies.<br />\nHaving dispensed with the<br />\nmeans of creation, Davis turns to<br />\nwhat is for him the more difficult<br />\nmatter of why zombies are made.<br />\nHe starts from the familiar cliche<br />\nabout evil priests and malevolent<br />\ngatherings choosing innocent victims and works his way through<br />\ninterviews with houngans and<br />\nsociety members, and eventually<br />\nattends some of their meetings.<br />\nThe upshot of it all is that the<br />\nsocieties do not simply choose<br />\nvictims at random, but rather<br />\ncontinue to function as courts for<br />\nsettling disputes, as their spiritual<br />\nancestors in Africa did. Rather<br />\nthan acting contrary to the good<br />\nof the community, the societies<br />\nact to protect the order and harmony of the community, settling<br />\nland disputes (a frequent problem) and family quarrels.<br />\nThis is the briefest summary of<br />\nthe general thrust of the book.<br />\nThere are so many small details<br />\nthat to say much more would require saying everything, an order<br />\nwhich the book takes 370 pages<br />\nto fill.

She also anchored the<br />\nfirst-place 4x100 meter relay<br />\nteam of Lynne Wright, Sharon<br />\nScott, and Laura Perlinn, whose<br />\ntime of 54.3 seconds qualified<br />\nthem for the MAC Championships. The other first place<br />\nfinishes came from co-captains<br />\nSuzi McGinn and Laura Perlinn<br />\nin the 400 and 800 meter dashes<br />\nand the 100 and 400 meter<br />\nhurdles, respectively, and the<br />\n4x100 meter relay team of Laura<br />\nPerlinn, Sharon Scott, Suzi<br />\nMcGinn, and anchor Diana<br />\nLogan.<br />\nAccording to Head Coach Gary<br />\nGreen, the key to their easy victory over Western Maryland was<br />\nearning points where they hadn't<br />\nbeen expected. Middle distance<br />\nrunner Suzi McGinn captured second place in the shot put, while<br />\nsprinter Lynne Wright placed<br />\nthird in the discus and javelin. In<br />\nthe same spirit, thrower Laura<br />\nNewcomer, after finishing second<br />\nin the discus and javelin and<br />\nthird in the shot put, took third in<br />\nthe 3000 meter run.<br />\nThe men's team did not fare as<br />\nwell as the women in their trimeet versus Western Maryland<br />\nand York College, finishing a<br />\nclose third behind Western<br />\nMaryland.

The<br />\nteam cannot seem to break the<br />\n420 stroke barrier and have a truly brilliant season; but instead,<br />\n,always finds that one score in the<br />\n90's that separates the average<br />\nteam from the prime time<br />\nperformer.<br />\nThe Whackers lost their home<br />\nopeners to Delaware and dropped<br />\nto 4-3, then placed fourth in the<br />\nWestern Maryland Invitational on<br />\nMonday to round off a week of<br />\nboring and mediocre golf.<br />\nThe team appears very tentative<br />\nand uncomfortable with the short<br />\ngame and putting, which explains<br />\nwhy it is not scoring well. Coach<br />\nO'Donnell held a special 'round<br />\nthe green' clinic which ought to<br />\ndrive down the scores at the<br />\nDickinson Invitational on Monday and at the MAC's next<br />\nweekend.<br />\nBlue Jays Choke Opener<br />\nThe Blue Jays met Deleware at<br />\nPine Ridge last Thursday, and<br />\nwhile a victory was only an outside shot, Delaware's 417 paved<br />\nthe way for a rousing Hopkins<br />\nupset. Instead, the home team<br />\nfans remained disappointed. The<br />\nWhackers shot 436 which included a 96 and failed to bridge the<br />\ncompetitive gap between country<br />\nclub and tournament golf.<br />\nJohnny Abrahams and Luigi<br />\nHanda led the dismal scoring with<br />\n86 and 85 respectively, each taking 40 putts. Luigi showed signs<br />\nof brilliance on the back nine with<br />\nan eagle on 13, but finished with<br />\nan 8 on 18 for a 38 on the<br />\nbackside. Abrahams, however,<br />\nremined consistently poor<br />\nthroughout his round, turning birdie opportunities into three putt<br />\nbogeys left and right.<br />\nNew kid in town Marc Quardt<br />\nwas the only breath of fresh air<br />\nfor Hopkins. Marc combined his<br />\nsexy haircut with an equally freeflowing and suave golf swing and<br />\nwent round in 82, at times making the game actually look easy.<br />\nMarc received praise from Coach<br />\nO'Donnell and seems likely to<br />\nmake the trip to the MAC's.<br />\nPaul Kadri posted his first sub90 score of the season, an 87,<br />\nwhich is encouraging given Mr.<br />\nKadri's heavy social schedule.<br />\nMr. Kadri's volleyball marathon<br />\nmay exclude him from several<br />\nmatches just when his game<br />\nseems to be on an upswing.<br />\nThe fifth score from Hopkins,<br />\na 96 by Grizzly Walutes, was the<br /><br />\nepitome of inconsistency and<br />\nslack golfing. Walutes probably<br />\nfelt the pressure playing against<br />\na Division One team, and his<br />\nabsence from competitive play<br />\nwhile doing time as the team<br />\nmascot didn't help either, but it<br />\nis the mark of a true champion to<br />\npull through against the odds, and<br />\nWalutes did not.<br />\nWestern Maryland Invitational<br />\nOn Monday the Whackers flew<br />\nto the Western Maryland Invitational in hopes of avenging their<br />\nlackadaisical performance against<br />\nDelaware but found themselves<br />\nmired in increasing mediocrity.<br />\nIf it wasn't one thing, it was<br />\nanother. While both Jon Thompson and Grizzly Walutes broke<br />\n90, Todd Stefan bloated to a 92,<br />\nand the team's total of 426 placed them fourth out of six teams.<br />\nGettysburg emerged eventual<br />\nwinners with 408, not a great<br />\nscore on this pitch and putt<br />\ncourse. This was the same team<br />\nthe Jays nipped at Gettysburg a<br />\nmere ten days ago.<br />\nAbrahams, as hehas so often<br />\nthis season, lead the linksters with<br />\nan 80 but still putted 40 times.<br />\nLuigi Handa followed close<br />\nbehind on 82, these low scores<br />\nbeing indicative of the easy<br />\ncourse rather than any exceptional golfing on the parts of the<br />\nHopkins nos. 1 and 2.<br />\nStefan's inconsistent play remains a mystery, although he<br />\nhasn't been able to practice due<br />\nto the MCATs coming up shortly. Coach O'Donnell will work<br />\nwith Todd on the practice tee and<br />\nhelp him regain tempo and confidence, key ingredients to the<br />\nsuccessful execution of the game.<br />\nOther Blue Jay competitors<br />\nwere Steve Schiller (93) still<br />\nhungover after his first job offer,<br />\nand the lefthander Bill Rica (96).<br />\nMAC Playoff<br />\nThis week's schedule is<br />\nhighlighted by the intra-squad<br />\ntourney today to decide who will<br />\nrepresent the Whackers at the<br />\nMAC's next weekend.<br />\nThis is the first time Coach<br />\nO'Donnell has introduced such a<br />\nsystem of qualification and it is<br />\ndesigned to make the players<br />\ntournament tough.

Usually, the<br />\nteam starts out strongly, but<br />\nbecause of the importance of the<br />\ngame, the team was scared.\" The<br />\nLady Jays' tentative first half led<br />\nto an 11-5 deficit at halftime. In<br />\nthe second half, however, the<br />\nLady Jays outplayed Western<br />\nMaryland 6-5. The momentum<br />\nhad changed. Spectacular<br />\ngoalkeeping from Laura Porter<br />\n(13 saves in the second half) as<br />\nwell as strong defensive. efforts<br /><br />\nfrom Julie Siegrist and Jen Stahl<br />\nkept Western Maryland's strong,<br />\nquick, and well-balanced attack in<br />\nlow gear. Freshman Julie Siegrist<br />\nheld Western Maryland's leading<br />\nscorer to only 2 goals, and Jen<br />\nStahl's move to defensive wing<br />\ncompletely shut down the scoring<br />\nfrom Western Maryland's speedy<br />\nattack wing.<br />\nThe game fell apart in the midfield. The attack had been averaged about 25 shots in the first half<br />\nof their games. This game there<br />\nwere only 10 shots (5 of which<br />\nwere goals). The midfield connection just was not there to get<br />\nthe ball to the attack.<br />\nThe Lady Jays are still hoping<br />\nfor a shot at the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference Championship.<br />\nShould Western Maryland lose to<br /><br />\nGettysburg next Wednesday, the<br />\nWest division would then have a<br />\nthree-way tie for first place, and<br />\nHopkins might be able to sneak<br />\nin the back door to the MAC<br />\nfinals. For the time being, the<br />\nlady laxers have their hearts set<br />\non winning the rest of their<br />\nregular season games\u2014Thursday,<br />\nApril 16, 6:30 p.m. against<br />\nDickinson at home; Saturday,<br />\nApril 18, 11 a.m. against<br />\nSwarthmore at home; and<br />\nWednesday', April 22 at Mary<br />\nWashington.
