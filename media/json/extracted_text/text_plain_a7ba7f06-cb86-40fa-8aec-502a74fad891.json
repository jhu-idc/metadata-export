Everyone is discussing our prospects and all of the 'true sports\" among the undergraduates are looking for bets. This year there will be no odds given by either side,<br />\nso far as we have been able to ascertain. Hopkins is doing every<br />\n,'11(<br />\npossible thing to back up the team, and we feel confident that the<br />\nifsvvvvvvvv11<br />\nI<br />\nteam will make every effort to win. We must win, and we will win.<br />\nThe alumni are giving us as much support'as they can, in that<br />\nthat they will turn out in large numbers to root for their Alma Mater,<br />\nand it is the duty of every undergraduate to be present at the game and to add his lusty<br />\ncheers to those of the alumni. We are sure that the undergraduates will make a good showing, but we want to be able to say that there was not one undergraduate who was not at the<br />\ngame. A movement is on foot among the collegiate students to have a large band to play for<br />\nthem at the game. This is an excellent idea, and should most certainly be encouraged and<br />\ncarried out.<br />\nOur team will not be the only one which will have large crowds to back it, as the St.<br />\nJohn's alumni have been very busy organizing a reunion, and they will attend the game in a<br />\nlarge body accompanied by a band, which will try to drown the yells, songs and band of the<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nva6s<br />\nvvVvvvvvVv,<br />\n<br />\nHIS copy of the NEWS-LETTER will probably appear on Thursday,<br />\nNovember 19th. That day will see the inauguration of an affair,<br />\ng .<br />\n21<br />\nthat from a student's point of view is undoubtedly the biggest thing<br />\n\u2022<br />\nin the way of a good time that has occured since the foundation of<br />\nIt \u2022<br />\nthis University.<br />\n11<br />\nThere is no need to go into detailed explanation of what this<br />\n\u2022<br />\naffair is. We'll venture to state that every undergraduate knows<br />\n\u2018V. st,st It It It It It It<br />\nthe three-days' program by heart, and knows the time and location of<br />\nparticular banquet and dinner, and we are further certain that<br />\neach<br />\n$2TS:11 t/t<br />\n11:t lid<br />\niK<br />\nevery undergrad, with the exception of the football squad, will be on<br />\nhand at every occasion where his presence is in the least desirable.<br />\nIt<br />\nI II<br />\n21 11 It It It It It It<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nIt must be great, it must bring a warm tickling to the heart, and a feeling like a tight<br />\ncollar in the throat, to know that your whereabouts are known to your Alma Mater, and to<br />\nfeel that your old classmates desire your presence at their first dinner together, since graduation, maybe twenty-five years ago, before even Walter Noir held forth in the basement. That<br />\nseries of dinners arranged for Friday, makes us almost wish we were alumni ourselves.<br />\nThe thanks of not only the graduates and alumni, but of the whole student body are<br />\ncertainly due to the committee, which under the lead of Mr. Radcliffe has engineered a most<br />\ndifficult undertaking. We are with it, body and soul, and this is our feeble way of voicing<br />\nour admiration of its object, and of the men who have made it possible.<br />\n<br />\nVRW2f2WIfftV_<br />\n<br />\nHIS year we started out with the intention of having a new picture<br />\non the cover of each issue of the NEWS-LETTER, but we have now<br />\ndecided to offer a prize of two dollars for the best cover design submitted to the Board of Editors, before December first of this year.<br />\nThe design may be either one of two kinds, namely\u2014a conventional<br />\ndesign which will serve for all times; or a design such that a new<br />\npicture may be inserted in the center whenever desired. Each design<br />\nmust contain the following wording: THE NEWS-LETTER, Published<br />\n.<br />\nby the Undergraduates and Johns Hopkins University. In case the<br />\nlatter style of design is submitted there must accompany it a picture,<br />\nwhich will fit in the center of the design, and drawn on a separate sheet.<br />\nWe reserve the right to use at our discretion, any drawing submitted, whether it is the<br />\nprize-winner or not.<br />\n<br />\nVVVVVVVVVVY<br />\nV<br />\nV<br />\n<br />\nv-t,A<br />\n<br />\nktr,<br />\n\u201eonooningviorkr<br />\n1r 1r<br />\n<br />\nN the last few years, we have all heard a great deal about the \"Open<br />\nDoor\" Policy. It is quite evident that an application of this idea<br />\nis possible in our own University. On the Monument street side of<br />\nSt<br />\nSt<br />\nMcCoy Hall there is a door opposite the Physical Laboratory. This<br />\nIt<br />\nSt<br />\ndoor is nelrly always closed, despite the fact that, if it were open, a<br />\nIt<br />\nmuch shorter route between the Laboratory and McCoy Hall would<br />\nSt<br />\nSi<br />\nlaid open for us. At present, in all sorts and conditions of<br />\nbe<br />\nIt<br />\n\u2022 'Si It It I: I:<br />\nIt It It<br />\nweather, we are forced to travel from McCoy Hall to the Mathematical Building by means of a circuitous route through part of the<br />\n{{<br />\ncampus,\" which route is said to conincide, rather appropriately,<br />\nwith the path of a parabolic curve.<br />\nThere are many of us who spend a great deal of time in the Physical Laboratory; and<br />\nespecially on cold, rainy days, the shortening of the path over to McCoy Hall would be<br />\ngreatly appreciated. We, therefore, ask the \"powers that be\" to consider this suggestion<br />\nthoughtfully, as there is no doubt that the students would appreciate such a reform.<br />\n<br />\nHopkins has suffered another great loss in the death of Prof. William K. Brooks, Professor of Zoology. The many students at the University who had a personal acquaintance with<br />\nProf. Brooks, whether in class or otherwise were, greatly attached to him. He was also much<br />\nbeloved by all the members of the faculty.<br />\nSuitable memorial exercises will be held at the University very shortly.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nA NEGLECTED CLASSIC.<br />\nHERBERT E. GREENE.<br />\n<br />\nA recent correspondent of the Nation tells<br />\nof several amusing experiences that he has had<br />\nin teaching the Bible. On one occasion be<br />\nasked a class of forty, 'How many of you<br />\ncollege men think you could find the book of<br />\nHezekiah in the Bible without using the index ?\" Fifteen of the forty were certain that<br />\nthey could accomplish this feat if they were<br />\nallowed five minutes for the search. A few<br />\nweeks later he put the same question to<br />\nanother class of thirteen college men, every<br />\none of whom was confident of success. Similar<br />\nexperiences might be related by many who<br />\nhave undertaken to teach college students.<br />\nMost teachers would agree that it is scarcely<br />\npossible to overstate the lack of familiarity<br />\nwith the Bible that is shown to-day by young<br />\nmen and women who are called educated.<br />\nYet there can be no question as to the practical unanimity with which people affirm that<br />\nof all books the Bible is the most important.<br />\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that<br />\nthe Bible is more frequently quoted than any<br />\nother book,\u2014often by those who would be<br />\npuzzled indeed if they were asked to trace<br />\ntheir quotations. English literature is saturated with Biblical allusion and Biblical quotation to such an extent that a reader who<br />\nhas only a slight acquaintance with the Bible<br />\ncannot hope to read understandingly or appreciatively such poets as Chaucer, Spenser,<br />\nShakspere, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Wordsworth, Byron, Tennyson, Browning, prose<br />\nwriters such as Bacon, Burke, Carlyle, Ruskin,<br />\nMatthew Arnold. This means that practically<br />\nall of our great writers and most of our lesser<br />\nwriters were Bible-reading men and women,<br />\nand that they assumed a familiarity with the<br />\nBible on the part of those for whom they<br />\nwrote. A recent writer has not been guilty<br />\nof over-statement when he says, ``Certainly<br />\nan intimate acquaintance with the Bible is the<br />\nbest possible preparation for a study of English literature.\" One may even venture to<br />\nassert that familiarity with the Bible is necessary to an understanding of the daily papers<br />\nand the current magazines.* Says another<br />\nrecent writer, \"The Biblical tradition impreg*The last number of Life assumes a knowledge of<br />\nthe story of two of our Old Testament prophets.<br />\n<br />\nnates all our fashions of thinking and speaking. A man totally unacquainted with the<br />\nsacred history would go through the world as<br />\nif deaf or blind. A people which loses familiarity with the Bible is exiled from its spiritual<br />\nand intellectual fatherland, and becomes a<br />\ntribe of outlaws.\" A prominent American<br />\nscholar has written of the Bible in the following words:\u2014\"These books contain a body of<br />\nhistory, poetry, and philosophy, the study of<br />\nwhich has done more than any other single<br />\ncause to modify the course and happiness of<br />\nthinking men on earth, and to color and direct<br />\nthe whole course of modern civilization.\"<br />\nThose who read various statements regarding the ignorance of college students with a<br />\nsmile of superiority,\u2014a feeling that is not<br />\nalways warranted,\u2014are apt to reflect, sometimes to comment, upon how little the college<br />\nhas done for the student. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthe tests of college classes that we read of<br />\nfrom time to time are commonly made with<br />\nFreshmen.t These tests both indicate an interest on the part of the college, and show<br />\nthat the responsibility for ignorance must be<br />\nplaced farther back than the college. Most<br />\nclasses contain a few students who show a<br />\nreasonable degree of familiarity with the Bible;<br />\nit usually appears that such familiarity has<br />\nbeen gained, not in the school, nor yet in the<br />\nchurch, but in the home. It is there, in<br />\ntruth, that such an acquaintance is most<br />\nreadily gained. Fathers and mothers who<br />\nreally believe that an intimate knowledge of<br />\nthe Bible is important will see to it that such<br />\nknowledge is gained in the home. No child<br />\nshould be defrauded of an early acquaintance<br />\nwith Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red<br />\nRiding Hood; and among his early heroes,<br />\nendeared by long association, should be<br />\nJoseph and Moses, Gideon and David. Soon<br />\nafter he knows by heart his nursery rhymes<br />\nhe is ready to be taught the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes.<br />\nThe question may be raised, what is done<br />\nby the colleges for students who appear to be<br />\nso greatly in need of Bible instruction? Are<br />\nthese students less ignorant when they<br />\ngraduate than they are when they enter? The<br />\nI.Interesting accounts of tests of this kind may be<br />\nfound in the Century for May, 1900, pages 123-128,<br />\nand for December, 1900, pages 273-276.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\ncolleges, it may be answered, do not undertake the kind of instruction that properly belongs to the church and the home; but many<br />\ncolleges do provide systematic instruction in<br />\nthe Bible, both in the original languages and<br />\nin English. In some colleges such courses<br />\nare prescribed; more frequently, however,<br />\nthey are elective. Courses of the latter kind<br />\nare provided by the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe effect of an intimate acquaintance with<br />\nthe Bible upon one's style is well known.<br />\n\"Intense study of the Bible,\" says Coleridge,<br />\n\"will keep any writer from being vulgar in<br />\npoint of style.\" Other faults he may have,<br />\nbut not the fault of common-placeness; his<br />\ndiction is likely to be simple, choice, dignified. Acting upon this belief, we require of<br />\nevery freshman the reading of a number of<br />\nEnglish classics,\u2014by Shakespere, Milton,<br />\nThackeray, Hawthorne, for example,\u2014and,<br />\nwith these classics, of considerable portions of<br />\nthe English Bible. We ask our students to<br />\nread the Bible as they read other literature,<br />\nseveral pages at a time; we do not ask them<br />\nto make a minute study of a few verses, tho<br />\nthat method of study is sometimes necessary<br />\nand helpful to a better understanding both of<br />\nthe Bible and of English literature. We have<br />\nreceived repeated testimony that never before<br />\nhas the Bible been found so interesting as<br />\nwhen it has been studied as literature,\u2014the<br />\nonly phase of Bible study that our department can properly deal with.<br />\nOne sometimes hears the question raised as<br />\nto whether a body of religious writings can<br />\nsuccessfully be taught to students of various<br />\nreligious faiths. The answer is, obviously,<br />\nthat it can be taught, as has repeatedly been<br />\ndone with success, if it is taught as literature.<br />\nObjections might, indeed, he made by narrowminded men; but I have never heard of such<br />\nobjections at this university. Rather I have<br />\nfound a keen and broad-minded interest in<br />\nwhatever has been of interest to humanity.<br />\nAll religious classics are deeply interesting,<br />\nmost of all for us the great Hebrew and<br />\nHellenistic classics that have had so profound<br />\nand far-reaching an influence upon all civilized nations. It would manifestly be improper to make use of university classes for<br />\nteaching one's own religious views; but if<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nsome of our English poems, by Wordsworth<br />\nand Shelley for example, cannot be understood without reference to the teaching of<br />\nPlato, much less can English literature, in its<br />\nlong history of twelve hundred years, be<br />\nunderstood by one who is unacquainted with<br />\nthe Old and the New Testaments. One who<br />\ndoes not know the beautiful story of Ruth cannot fully enjoy Keats's Ode lo a Nightingale;<br />\none who has not read the book of Judges cannot understand Tennyson's Dream of Fair<br />\nWomen; one who is not acquainted with the<br />\nparables of Jesus misses something when he<br />\ntries to read Tennyson's Guinevere. It for this<br />\nreason that considerable portions of the Bible<br />\nare included in the freshman course of reading; that an historical sketch of the English<br />\nBible is included in one of our elective courses;<br />\nand that in the study of any author a familiarity with Biblical quotations and allusions is<br />\nexpected wherever such familiarity is needed<br />\nfor an understanding of the thought and<br />\nmeaning of that author.<br />\n<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR\u2014The inter-fraternity treaty proposed<br />\nby THE NEWS-LETTER is the right sort. Perhaps the plan is too complicated to work.<br />\nMaybe the proposed inter-fraternity secretary<br />\nwould know too much about the affairs of<br />\nother fraternities than his own. Perhaps the<br />\npenalty is vague. Anybody can find some<br />\nfault with the scheme. But that's no reason<br />\nfor not having any scheme at all. Unless a<br />\nman can deny the truth of your preamble (I<br />\ndon't see how he can) he ought to favor your<br />\nplan or a better one. What we want now is<br />\nto see the active members of the Hopkins<br />\nfraternities get together and talk the matter<br />\nover sensibly. When they agree on a plan,<br />\nlet them go ahead. If one or two fainthearted chapters won't come in, let them stay<br />\nout; and public opinion,particularly fraternityalumni opinion, will be squarely behind the<br />\nchapters that stands for dignity and public<br />\nspirit. In the end, those chapters will get all<br />\nthe good men they want, for the good men<br />\nwill wait to see what they are going to do.<br />\n<br />\nALUMNUS.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n6<br />\n_<br />\n<br />\nTo the Board of Editors<br />\nof THE NEWS- LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nDEAR SIR\u2014The fraternity treaty recently<br />\nproposed by THE NEWS-LETTER has left<br />\nmany of us in a haze of doubt over the practibility of it. Here are several points that the<br />\nauthor, or authors, have evidently overlooked.<br />\nFirst, they say that the treaty is founded<br />\nupon the inter-club treaty at Princeton; evidently they are unaware that last year two of<br />\nthe leading clubs at Princeton dropped out of<br />\nthe treaty, saying, that while they considered<br />\nthe idea of the treaty sound, that it was tinpracticable, because there was no way to<br />\nenforce it.<br />\nThe same is true of the situation at Johns<br />\nHopkins. While the idea of the treaty is<br />\ngood, so far as all practicable purpose goes, it<br />\nis worthless. Such a treaty must have as its<br />\nfoundation, either perfect confidence between<br />\nthe fraternities, or some penalty so severe,<br />\nthat the breaking of the treaty would be out<br />\nof the question. At a Pan-Hellenic Council,<br />\nlast year, a treaty along these same general<br />\nlines was agitated, its purpose being to put a<br />\nstop to early pledging. This treaty failed to<br />\nbe adopted for the reason that the several<br />\nfraternities at the University were unwilling<br />\nto enter into an agreement with each other<br />\nwhere the honor of the fraternities was the<br />\nonly guarantee of the treaty being kept. This<br />\nsituation is indeed lamentable, but is only the<br />\ndirect result of inter-fraternity politics during<br />\nthe last few years.<br />\nThe penalty proposed in the NEws-LETTER<br />\ntreaty is utterly inadequate. ''In case of a<br />\ncharge being brought against a fraternity, the<br />\ndelegates of that fraternity to the Pan-Hellenic<br />\nCouncil, shall investigate the charge and<br />\nreport their findings in the same to the council<br />\nThat is all very well, but if the accusation is<br />\ntrue, how much may you expect the members<br />\nof the fraternity to admit? From my experience with inter-fraternity policies at Hopkins,<br />\nI should scarcely expect to find a fraternity<br />\nsacrificing itself to the general good. And<br />\nagain the secret nature of fraternities is such<br />\nthat no one but a member of the fraternity<br />\nwould be in a position to investigate the<br />\ncharge against the said fraternity. Here, we<br />\nhave all the Princeton troubles at their worst<br />\n<br />\nwith an added complication in the way of the<br />\nsecret nature of a fraternity.<br />\nAgain, can a fraternity situated in a city,<br />\nwith a large number of alumni about it, be<br />\nresponsible for the actions of those alumni?<br />\nThe Princeton clubs had no such alumni in<br />\ndaily contact with it. Article III, Section 6,<br />\nClause 2, provides that if an incoming freshman is unable to sign the oath in Article III,<br />\nSection 5, through action on his part caused<br />\nby ignorance of the conditions that he be at<br />\nliberty to join any fraternity sending him an<br />\ninvitation, no previous pledge being binding.<br />\nWhat is to prevent an alumnus of a chapter<br />\npledging a man before entrance? The fraternity with all fairness, may disclaim all responsibility for the action of the alumnus, yet<br />\nreap the benefits of it.<br />\nThe only clause in the treaty which would be<br />\nof practical use is that clause which prohibits<br />\nsub-freshman the privilege of entering a<br />\nfraternity house before March 1st, of the year<br />\nbefore they enter. But with Hopkins, the<br />\nmen are not sure just what year they will<br />\nenter, so in many cases this rule may be<br />\nbroken through no intention of the fraternity.<br />\nAnd this clause alone would be of little use in<br />\nbreaking up the present abuses.<br />\nA house of cards balanced upon a toothpick is not a very edifying sight. The authors<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER treaty seem to count<br />\nit nothing that their treaty has already<br />\nfailed under much more favorable conditions<br />\nthan are offered at Hopkins, and that several<br />\nof the Hopkins fraternities have within the<br />\nlast year signified their unwillingness to enter<br />\ninto any treaty of this nature.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nALAN CHuRcHILL WOODS.<br />\nNovember 14, 1908.<br />\n<br />\nSCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION.<br />\nThe first of the monthly meetings of the<br />\nScientific Association, was held in Hopkins<br />\nHall, at 4 P.

In fact, when they had run about<br />\nthirty yards up the straight, Carpenter was<br />\nonly about eighteen inches from the outside<br />\nedge of the track (near the 'cycle track).

C.<br />\nWhen the 'Varsity team meets St. John's<br />\nin the annual big game next Saturday, one of<br />\nthe toughest football battles ever fought in<br />\nthis city will undoubtedly result. St. John's<br />\nhas the greatest team in its history this year,<br />\nand the same may be said of Hopkins, for our<br />\nteam has made a great record this year. Our<br />\ndefeat at the hands of Delaware was one of<br />\nthose things that will happen to the best of<br />\nteams when luck, weather conditions and<br />\nsickness are against them.<br />\nSt. John's has played eight games this year<br />\nand has won six of them, losing to the University of Virginia and the Naval Academy.<br />\nTheir record up-to-date stands, 147 points<br />\nwon against 63 lost. This is certainly an<br />\nenviable record when one thinks of the caliber<br />\nof the teams that St. John's has played. From<br />\nthe above total we see that the average score<br />\nfor each game is 18 to 8. This average shows<br />\ntwo things: First, that the St. John's backfield is wonderfully aggressive on the offensive,<br />\nand second, that their defence is a trifle weak.<br />\nThe St. John's back-field is composed of<br />\nGrove, fullback; Warfield, left halfback; and<br />\nRuhl, right halfback. These men are all<br />\nreliable ground-gainers. Ruhl is probably<br />\nthe star of the trio, for his end-running and<br />\nforward-passing have been responsible for<br />\n41 Hopkins men have long been pleased with the<br />\nexcellence of the furnishings to be found in the<br />\nMen's Store at<br />\n<br />\nHUTZLEK 131C1-1EK5<br />\n210-218 NORTH HOWARD ST.<br />\n<br />\nCONFECTIONER AND CATERER<br />\n701 West North Avenue<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nmany of St. John's scores.

Of course the loss of<br />\nBosley, their captain, quarterback and dropkicker, will handicap the team to a certain<br />\nextent, but Butler, the sub-quarter, played an<br />\nexcellent game last Saturday.<br />\nThe Black and Blue record this year is too<br />\nwell known for a recital. In the six games<br />\nplayed we have scored 49 points to our opponpents' 28. Our line will be greatly<br />\nstrengthened, we hope, by the return of Captain Stockton and Owens.

Everyone is discussing our prospects and all of the 'true sports\" among the undergraduates are looking for bets. This year there will be no odds given by either side,<br />\nso far as we have been able to ascertain. Hopkins is doing every<br />\n,'11(<br />\npossible thing to back up the team, and we feel confident that the<br />\nifsvvvvvvvv11<br />\nI<br />\nteam will make every effort to win. We must win, and we will win.<br />\nThe alumni are giving us as much support'as they can, in that<br />\nthat they will turn out in large numbers to root for their Alma Mater,<br />\nand it is the duty of every undergraduate to be present at the game and to add his lusty<br />\ncheers to those of the alumni. We are sure that the undergraduates will make a good showing, but we want to be able to say that there was not one undergraduate who was not at the<br />\ngame. A movement is on foot among the collegiate students to have a large band to play for<br />\nthem at the game. This is an excellent idea, and should most certainly be encouraged and<br />\ncarried out.<br />\nOur team will not be the only one which will have large crowds to back it, as the St.<br />\nJohn's alumni have been very busy organizing a reunion, and they will attend the game in a<br />\nlarge body accompanied by a band, which will try to drown the yells, songs and band of the<br />\nHopkins men.<br />\nva6s<br />\nvvVvvvvvVv,<br /><br />\nHIS copy of the NEWS-LETTER will probably appear on Thursday,<br />\nNovember 19th. That day will see the inauguration of an affair,<br />\ng .<br />\n21<br />\nthat from a student's point of view is undoubtedly the biggest thing<br />\n\u2022<br />\nin the way of a good time that has occured since the foundation of<br />\nIt \u2022<br />\nthis University.<br />\n11<br />\nThere is no need to go into detailed explanation of what this<br />\n\u2022<br />\naffair is. We'll venture to state that every undergraduate knows<br />\n\u2018V. st,st It It It It It It<br />\nthe three-days' program by heart, and knows the time and location of<br />\nparticular banquet and dinner, and we are further certain that<br />\neach<br />\n$2TS:11 t/t<br />\n11:t lid<br />\niK<br />\nevery undergrad, with the exception of the football squad, will be on<br />\nhand at every occasion where his presence is in the least desirable.<br />\nIt<br />\nI II<br />\n21 11 It It It It It It<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nIt must be great, it must bring a warm tickling to the heart, and a feeling like a tight<br />\ncollar in the throat, to know that your whereabouts are known to your Alma Mater, and to<br />\nfeel that your old classmates desire your presence at their first dinner together, since graduation, maybe twenty-five years ago, before even Walter Noir held forth in the basement. That<br />\nseries of dinners arranged for Friday, makes us almost wish we were alumni ourselves.<br />\nThe thanks of not only the graduates and alumni, but of the whole student body are<br />\ncertainly due to the committee, which under the lead of Mr. Radcliffe has engineered a most<br />\ndifficult undertaking. We are with it, body and soul, and this is our feeble way of voicing<br />\nour admiration of its object, and of the men who have made it possible.<br /><br />\nVRW2f2WIfftV_<br /><br />\nHIS year we started out with the intention of having a new picture<br />\non the cover of each issue of the NEWS-LETTER, but we have now<br />\ndecided to offer a prize of two dollars for the best cover design submitted to the Board of Editors, before December first of this year.<br />\nThe design may be either one of two kinds, namely\u2014a conventional<br />\ndesign which will serve for all times; or a design such that a new<br />\npicture may be inserted in the center whenever desired. Each design<br />\nmust contain the following wording: THE NEWS-LETTER, Published<br />\n.<br />\nby the Undergraduates and Johns Hopkins University. In case the<br />\nlatter style of design is submitted there must accompany it a picture,<br />\nwhich will fit in the center of the design, and drawn on a separate sheet.<br />\nWe reserve the right to use at our discretion, any drawing submitted, whether it is the<br />\nprize-winner or not.<br /><br />\nVVVVVVVVVVY<br />\nV<br />\nV<br /><br />\nv-t,A<br /><br />\nktr,<br />\n\u201eonooningviorkr<br />\n1r 1r<br /><br />\nN the last few years, we have all heard a great deal about the \"Open<br />\nDoor\" Policy. It is quite evident that an application of this idea<br />\nis possible in our own University. On the Monument street side of<br />\nSt<br />\nSt<br />\nMcCoy Hall there is a door opposite the Physical Laboratory. This<br />\nIt<br />\nSt<br />\ndoor is nelrly always closed, despite the fact that, if it were open, a<br />\nIt<br />\nmuch shorter route between the Laboratory and McCoy Hall would<br />\nSt<br />\nSi<br />\nlaid open for us. At present, in all sorts and conditions of<br />\nbe<br />\nIt<br />\n\u2022 'Si It It I: I:<br />\nIt It It<br />\nweather, we are forced to travel from McCoy Hall to the Mathematical Building by means of a circuitous route through part of the<br />\n{{<br />\ncampus,\" which route is said to conincide, rather appropriately,<br />\nwith the path of a parabolic curve.<br />\nThere are many of us who spend a great deal of time in the Physical Laboratory; and<br />\nespecially on cold, rainy days, the shortening of the path over to McCoy Hall would be<br />\ngreatly appreciated. We, therefore, ask the \"powers that be\" to consider this suggestion<br />\nthoughtfully, as there is no doubt that the students would appreciate such a reform.<br /><br />\nHopkins has suffered another great loss in the death of Prof. William K. Brooks, Professor of Zoology. The many students at the University who had a personal acquaintance with<br />\nProf. Brooks, whether in class or otherwise were, greatly attached to him. He was also much<br />\nbeloved by all the members of the faculty.<br />\nSuitable memorial exercises will be held at the University very shortly.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nA NEGLECTED CLASSIC.<br />\nHERBERT E. GREENE.<br /><br />\nA recent correspondent of the Nation tells<br />\nof several amusing experiences that he has had<br />\nin teaching the Bible. On one occasion be<br />\nasked a class of forty, 'How many of you<br />\ncollege men think you could find the book of<br />\nHezekiah in the Bible without using the index ?\" Fifteen of the forty were certain that<br />\nthey could accomplish this feat if they were<br />\nallowed five minutes for the search. A few<br />\nweeks later he put the same question to<br />\nanother class of thirteen college men, every<br />\none of whom was confident of success. Similar<br />\nexperiences might be related by many who<br />\nhave undertaken to teach college students.<br />\nMost teachers would agree that it is scarcely<br />\npossible to overstate the lack of familiarity<br />\nwith the Bible that is shown to-day by young<br />\nmen and women who are called educated.<br />\nYet there can be no question as to the practical unanimity with which people affirm that<br />\nof all books the Bible is the most important.<br />\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that<br />\nthe Bible is more frequently quoted than any<br />\nother book,\u2014often by those who would be<br />\npuzzled indeed if they were asked to trace<br />\ntheir quotations. English literature is saturated with Biblical allusion and Biblical quotation to such an extent that a reader who<br />\nhas only a slight acquaintance with the Bible<br />\ncannot hope to read understandingly or appreciatively such poets as Chaucer, Spenser,<br />\nShakspere, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Wordsworth, Byron, Tennyson, Browning, prose<br />\nwriters such as Bacon, Burke, Carlyle, Ruskin,<br />\nMatthew Arnold. This means that practically<br />\nall of our great writers and most of our lesser<br />\nwriters were Bible-reading men and women,<br />\nand that they assumed a familiarity with the<br />\nBible on the part of those for whom they<br />\nwrote. A recent writer has not been guilty<br />\nof over-statement when he says, ``Certainly<br />\nan intimate acquaintance with the Bible is the<br />\nbest possible preparation for a study of English literature.\" One may even venture to<br />\nassert that familiarity with the Bible is necessary to an understanding of the daily papers<br />\nand the current magazines.* Says another<br />\nrecent writer, \"The Biblical tradition impreg*The last number of Life assumes a knowledge of<br />\nthe story of two of our Old Testament prophets.<br /><br />\nnates all our fashions of thinking and speaking. A man totally unacquainted with the<br />\nsacred history would go through the world as<br />\nif deaf or blind. A people which loses familiarity with the Bible is exiled from its spiritual<br />\nand intellectual fatherland, and becomes a<br />\ntribe of outlaws.\" A prominent American<br />\nscholar has written of the Bible in the following words:\u2014\"These books contain a body of<br />\nhistory, poetry, and philosophy, the study of<br />\nwhich has done more than any other single<br />\ncause to modify the course and happiness of<br />\nthinking men on earth, and to color and direct<br />\nthe whole course of modern civilization.\"<br />\nThose who read various statements regarding the ignorance of college students with a<br />\nsmile of superiority,\u2014a feeling that is not<br />\nalways warranted,\u2014are apt to reflect, sometimes to comment, upon how little the college<br />\nhas done for the student. As a matter of fact,<br />\nthe tests of college classes that we read of<br />\nfrom time to time are commonly made with<br />\nFreshmen.t These tests both indicate an interest on the part of the college, and show<br />\nthat the responsibility for ignorance must be<br />\nplaced farther back than the college. Most<br />\nclasses contain a few students who show a<br />\nreasonable degree of familiarity with the Bible;<br />\nit usually appears that such familiarity has<br />\nbeen gained, not in the school, nor yet in the<br />\nchurch, but in the home. It is there, in<br />\ntruth, that such an acquaintance is most<br />\nreadily gained. Fathers and mothers who<br />\nreally believe that an intimate knowledge of<br />\nthe Bible is important will see to it that such<br />\nknowledge is gained in the home. No child<br />\nshould be defrauded of an early acquaintance<br />\nwith Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red<br />\nRiding Hood; and among his early heroes,<br />\nendeared by long association, should be<br />\nJoseph and Moses, Gideon and David. Soon<br />\nafter he knows by heart his nursery rhymes<br />\nhe is ready to be taught the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes.<br />\nThe question may be raised, what is done<br />\nby the colleges for students who appear to be<br />\nso greatly in need of Bible instruction? Are<br />\nthese students less ignorant when they<br />\ngraduate than they are when they enter? The<br />\nI.Interesting accounts of tests of this kind may be<br />\nfound in the Century for May, 1900, pages 123-128,<br />\nand for December, 1900, pages 273-276.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncolleges, it may be answered, do not undertake the kind of instruction that properly belongs to the church and the home; but many<br />\ncolleges do provide systematic instruction in<br />\nthe Bible, both in the original languages and<br />\nin English. In some colleges such courses<br />\nare prescribed; more frequently, however,<br />\nthey are elective. Courses of the latter kind<br />\nare provided by the Johns Hopkins University.<br />\nThe effect of an intimate acquaintance with<br />\nthe Bible upon one's style is well known.<br />\n\"Intense study of the Bible,\" says Coleridge,<br />\n\"will keep any writer from being vulgar in<br />\npoint of style.\" Other faults he may have,<br />\nbut not the fault of common-placeness; his<br />\ndiction is likely to be simple, choice, dignified. Acting upon this belief, we require of<br />\nevery freshman the reading of a number of<br />\nEnglish classics,\u2014by Shakespere, Milton,<br />\nThackeray, Hawthorne, for example,\u2014and,<br />\nwith these classics, of considerable portions of<br />\nthe English Bible. We ask our students to<br />\nread the Bible as they read other literature,<br />\nseveral pages at a time; we do not ask them<br />\nto make a minute study of a few verses, tho<br />\nthat method of study is sometimes necessary<br />\nand helpful to a better understanding both of<br />\nthe Bible and of English literature. We have<br />\nreceived repeated testimony that never before<br />\nhas the Bible been found so interesting as<br />\nwhen it has been studied as literature,\u2014the<br />\nonly phase of Bible study that our department can properly deal with.<br />\nOne sometimes hears the question raised as<br />\nto whether a body of religious writings can<br />\nsuccessfully be taught to students of various<br />\nreligious faiths. The answer is, obviously,<br />\nthat it can be taught, as has repeatedly been<br />\ndone with success, if it is taught as literature.<br />\nObjections might, indeed, he made by narrowminded men; but I have never heard of such<br />\nobjections at this university. Rather I have<br />\nfound a keen and broad-minded interest in<br />\nwhatever has been of interest to humanity.<br />\nAll religious classics are deeply interesting,<br />\nmost of all for us the great Hebrew and<br />\nHellenistic classics that have had so profound<br />\nand far-reaching an influence upon all civilized nations. It would manifestly be improper to make use of university classes for<br />\nteaching one's own religious views; but if<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nsome of our English poems, by Wordsworth<br />\nand Shelley for example, cannot be understood without reference to the teaching of<br />\nPlato, much less can English literature, in its<br />\nlong history of twelve hundred years, be<br />\nunderstood by one who is unacquainted with<br />\nthe Old and the New Testaments. One who<br />\ndoes not know the beautiful story of Ruth cannot fully enjoy Keats's Ode lo a Nightingale;<br />\none who has not read the book of Judges cannot understand Tennyson's Dream of Fair<br />\nWomen; one who is not acquainted with the<br />\nparables of Jesus misses something when he<br />\ntries to read Tennyson's Guinevere. It for this<br />\nreason that considerable portions of the Bible<br />\nare included in the freshman course of reading; that an historical sketch of the English<br />\nBible is included in one of our elective courses;<br />\nand that in the study of any author a familiarity with Biblical quotations and allusions is<br />\nexpected wherever such familiarity is needed<br />\nfor an understanding of the thought and<br />\nmeaning of that author.<br /><br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSIR\u2014The inter-fraternity treaty proposed<br />\nby THE NEWS-LETTER is the right sort. Perhaps the plan is too complicated to work.<br />\nMaybe the proposed inter-fraternity secretary<br />\nwould know too much about the affairs of<br />\nother fraternities than his own. Perhaps the<br />\npenalty is vague. Anybody can find some<br />\nfault with the scheme. But that's no reason<br />\nfor not having any scheme at all. Unless a<br />\nman can deny the truth of your preamble (I<br />\ndon't see how he can) he ought to favor your<br />\nplan or a better one. What we want now is<br />\nto see the active members of the Hopkins<br />\nfraternities get together and talk the matter<br />\nover sensibly. When they agree on a plan,<br />\nlet them go ahead. If one or two fainthearted chapters won't come in, let them stay<br />\nout; and public opinion,particularly fraternityalumni opinion, will be squarely behind the<br />\nchapters that stands for dignity and public<br />\nspirit. In the end, those chapters will get all<br />\nthe good men they want, for the good men<br />\nwill wait to see what they are going to do.<br /><br />\nALUMNUS.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n6<br />\n_<br /><br />\nTo the Board of Editors<br />\nof THE NEWS- LETTER:<br /><br />\nDEAR SIR\u2014The fraternity treaty recently<br />\nproposed by THE NEWS-LETTER has left<br />\nmany of us in a haze of doubt over the practibility of it. Here are several points that the<br />\nauthor, or authors, have evidently overlooked.<br />\nFirst, they say that the treaty is founded<br />\nupon the inter-club treaty at Princeton; evidently they are unaware that last year two of<br />\nthe leading clubs at Princeton dropped out of<br />\nthe treaty, saying, that while they considered<br />\nthe idea of the treaty sound, that it was tinpracticable, because there was no way to<br />\nenforce it.<br />\nThe same is true of the situation at Johns<br />\nHopkins. While the idea of the treaty is<br />\ngood, so far as all practicable purpose goes, it<br />\nis worthless. Such a treaty must have as its<br />\nfoundation, either perfect confidence between<br />\nthe fraternities, or some penalty so severe,<br />\nthat the breaking of the treaty would be out<br />\nof the question. At a Pan-Hellenic Council,<br />\nlast year, a treaty along these same general<br />\nlines was agitated, its purpose being to put a<br />\nstop to early pledging. This treaty failed to<br />\nbe adopted for the reason that the several<br />\nfraternities at the University were unwilling<br />\nto enter into an agreement with each other<br />\nwhere the honor of the fraternities was the<br />\nonly guarantee of the treaty being kept. This<br />\nsituation is indeed lamentable, but is only the<br />\ndirect result of inter-fraternity politics during<br />\nthe last few years.<br />\nThe penalty proposed in the NEws-LETTER<br />\ntreaty is utterly inadequate. ''In case of a<br />\ncharge being brought against a fraternity, the<br />\ndelegates of that fraternity to the Pan-Hellenic<br />\nCouncil, shall investigate the charge and<br />\nreport their findings in the same to the council<br />\nThat is all very well, but if the accusation is<br />\ntrue, how much may you expect the members<br />\nof the fraternity to admit? From my experience with inter-fraternity policies at Hopkins,<br />\nI should scarcely expect to find a fraternity<br />\nsacrificing itself to the general good. And<br />\nagain the secret nature of fraternities is such<br />\nthat no one but a member of the fraternity<br />\nwould be in a position to investigate the<br />\ncharge against the said fraternity. Here, we<br />\nhave all the Princeton troubles at their worst<br /><br />\nwith an added complication in the way of the<br />\nsecret nature of a fraternity.<br />\nAgain, can a fraternity situated in a city,<br />\nwith a large number of alumni about it, be<br />\nresponsible for the actions of those alumni?<br />\nThe Princeton clubs had no such alumni in<br />\ndaily contact with it. Article III, Section 6,<br />\nClause 2, provides that if an incoming freshman is unable to sign the oath in Article III,<br />\nSection 5, through action on his part caused<br />\nby ignorance of the conditions that he be at<br />\nliberty to join any fraternity sending him an<br />\ninvitation, no previous pledge being binding.<br />\nWhat is to prevent an alumnus of a chapter<br />\npledging a man before entrance? The fraternity with all fairness, may disclaim all responsibility for the action of the alumnus, yet<br />\nreap the benefits of it.<br />\nThe only clause in the treaty which would be<br />\nof practical use is that clause which prohibits<br />\nsub-freshman the privilege of entering a<br />\nfraternity house before March 1st, of the year<br />\nbefore they enter. But with Hopkins, the<br />\nmen are not sure just what year they will<br />\nenter, so in many cases this rule may be<br />\nbroken through no intention of the fraternity.<br />\nAnd this clause alone would be of little use in<br />\nbreaking up the present abuses.<br />\nA house of cards balanced upon a toothpick is not a very edifying sight. The authors<br />\nof THE NEWS-LETTER treaty seem to count<br />\nit nothing that their treaty has already<br />\nfailed under much more favorable conditions<br />\nthan are offered at Hopkins, and that several<br />\nof the Hopkins fraternities have within the<br />\nlast year signified their unwillingness to enter<br />\ninto any treaty of this nature.<br />\nVery truly yours,<br />\nALAN CHuRcHILL WOODS.<br />\nNovember 14, 1908.<br /><br />\nSCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION.<br />\nThe first of the monthly meetings of the<br />\nScientific Association, was held in Hopkins<br />\nHall, at 4 P.

St. John's<br />\nhas the greatest team in its history this year,<br />\nand the same may be said of Hopkins, for our<br />\nteam has made a great record this year. Our<br />\ndefeat at the hands of Delaware was one of<br />\nthose things that will happen to the best of<br />\nteams when luck, weather conditions and<br />\nsickness are against them.<br />\nSt. John's has played eight games this year<br />\nand has won six of them, losing to the University of Virginia and the Naval Academy.<br />\nTheir record up-to-date stands, 147 points<br />\nwon against 63 lost. This is certainly an<br />\nenviable record when one thinks of the caliber<br />\nof the teams that St. John's has played. From<br />\nthe above total we see that the average score<br />\nfor each game is 18 to 8. This average shows<br />\ntwo things: First, that the St. John's backfield is wonderfully aggressive on the offensive,<br />\nand second, that their defence is a trifle weak.<br />\nThe St. John's back-field is composed of<br />\nGrove, fullback; Warfield, left halfback; and<br />\nRuhl, right halfback. These men are all<br />\nreliable ground-gainers.

A<br />\nbig crowd was out. The first speaker was<br />\nDr. George L. P. Radcliffe, '97, to whom<br />\nmuch of the credit for the reunion is due.<br />\nHe asked for the support of the undergraduates, and was greeted with rousing<br />\ncheers. Mr. Stuart S. Janney, '95, was the<br />\nnext speaker. Mr. Janney's presence was<br />\nquite appropriate, as his own doughty deeds<br />\nagainst St. John's have become a Hopkins<br />\ntradition. Mr. Stephen P. Harwood, '99, a<br />\nformer chief rooter, also made a speech and<br />\npromised a large band of alumni to help in<br />\nthe rooting.<br />\nIt was announced that Hopkins has secured<br />\nthe 300 seats in the stand nearest the center of<br />\nthe field. Alumni and undergraduates will<br />\ngather here around their class banners. At<br />\npresent writing, the band fund will be large<br />\nenough to have a fine band.<br /><br />\nCLURECO SHRUNK<br /><br />\nQUARTER SIZE<br /><br />\nC 0 L LAKS<br />\nDISTINCTLY THE COLLAR OF<br />\nTIIF: YEAR<br />\n15 Cents\u2014 for 25 Cents<br />\nCluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Troy.
