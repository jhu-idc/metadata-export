S.<br />\nCommissioner of Education Philander P. Claxton talked at the<br />\nLife Work Lecture last Tuesday.<br />\nMr. Claxton gave these three<br />\nquestions for consideration before<br />\ndeciding on a life work: (1)<br />\nWhat can be accomplished for<br />\nothers by doing the work? (2)<br />\nHow much pleasure and enjoyment can be got for oneself?<br />\n(3) Can a decent living be made<br />\nin the work?<br />\nIn answer to the question of<br />\nwhat can be done for others, Mr.<br />\nClaxton emphasized the tremendous need of education brought on<br />\nby the war. The war has democratized the world and illiterate<br />\npeople cannot function in a democracy. The whole world must<br />\nbe educated so that the democracies may succeed in giving their<br />\npeople prosperity. The war has<br />\ngreatly cut down the man power<br />\nof the world. To replace this,<br />\nlabor-saving machines must be<br />\nused and this involves teaching<br />\nlaborers to run the machines.<br />\nThe pleasures of the school<br />\nteacher are very great. The<br />\nteacher feels that he is doing<br />\nsomething worth while for society; he sees his former scholars go out into life and gets great<br />\n\u2022satisfaction when he hears of<br />\nsplendid achievements of some of<br />\nthem; and, greater still, he has<br />\nthe joy of living with younger<br />\npeople and watching them develop.<br />\nAlthough the income of the<br />\nschool teacher is at present<br />\nsmall, Mr. Claxton believes that<br />\nwe are at the beginning of a period of increasing incomes for<br />\nteachers and predicts that soon<br />\ninstructors will be paid a salary<br />\nwhich will bear a close correlation to the great benefits they<br />\nbestow on mankind.<br />\n<br />\nYOUNG MEN'S OVERCOATS<br />\nValues to $37.50<br />\n<br />\n$17.50<br />\nAll the new models, full of snap,<br />\nyouth and go.<br />\n<br />\nTEWARTEICI.<br />\nLI COS'S,(ion With Jami, & rCrerrir & Co..Netn<br />\n<br />\nHOWARD AND LEXINGTON STS.<br />\nPhone Connections<br />\n<br />\nJAMES W.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 15, 1919<br />\nThe Pride of the Navy.<br />\n<br />\nWe are neither poor sports nor<br />\nhard losers. We have gracefully<br />\nsuffered defeats enough to refute<br />\nthat charge, for \"Palnutm qui<br />\nmeruit ferat\" has always been the<br />\nHopkins motto, especially in regard to athletic contests. The<br />\nNavy lacrosse game\u2014if it can be<br />\ncalled a game\u2014should not, however, fall under the category of<br />\nthose which Hopkins has lost because of the clean, superior play<br />\nof her opponents. The Academy<br />\nhas sustained a disgrace which<br />\ncannot easily be wiped out.<br />\nThe first half of the game,<br />\nthough bitterly contested, was free<br />\nfrom the terrific slugging that<br />\ncharacterized the last few minutes<br />\nof play. Though the Navy brand<br />\nof lacrosse did not have the sportsmanlike character of that of Lehigh and other Hopkins opponents, still we should have registered no kick had the remainder<br />\nof the game been so played. At<br />\nthe end of the half, the score stood<br />\ntwo all. After much seesawing<br />\nof the ball, Hopkins finally netted<br />\nanother goal. Then a peculiar psychological factor entered in. We<br />\nshall pay the big Navy team the<br />\ndelicate compliment that they are<br />\ndistinctly unlike the Huns, who,<br />\nformer prisoners in their camps<br />\ntell us, were astoundingly arrogant and brutal when winning,<br />\nbut cajolingly gentle when they<br />\nsaw they had lost. Navy, seeing<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nthat the enemy was in the lead<br />\nand that there were only seven<br />\nmore minutei to play, was, in the<br />\nliteral sense, out for blood.<br />\n\"Eggie\" Sutton was knocked<br />\nout with a deep cut on the head,<br />\nand time was called till it could<br />\nbe bandaged. When he .returned<br />\nto the game, his bandaged head<br />\nwas noticeably a target for the<br />\nAnnapolis stickmen. After sustaining repeated blows on this injured member, he finally fell under a particularly vicious swing,<br />\nand, with blood flowing freely, was<br />\ncarried from the field.<br />\nFour other Black and Blue<br />\nstickwielders \u2014 Defandorf, Beall,<br />\nBaxley and Silberstein, far from<br />\nthe largest men on the team, the<br />\nlatter with wide open cuts on the<br />\nhead \u2014 were in quick succession<br />\nlaid out on the field. Hoffman,<br />\nalso, received a nasty gash on the<br />\ncheek. Time was repeatedy called,<br />\nthese men pluckily coming back<br />\nfor more, and several of the Navy<br />\nteam were ejected for a few minutes. But why go into the details? It was pronounced by experts the finest exhibition of dirty<br />\nplaying they had ever seen.<br />\nNavy had an overwhelming<br />\nshare of weight and brawn, which<br />\nthey figured they could use to advantage. Had it come to a mutual slugging match, they would<br />\nhave had the edge. As it was onesided slugging, not a Navy man<br />\nwas knocked out or badly cut<br />\nwhile many of the Black and Blue<br />\nwill show for many a day that<br />\nthey were in a dirty game. Many<br />\nof the cuts were received by the<br />\nHopkins stickers after they had<br />\ngotten the ball away.<br />\nThe score has no bearing on the<br />\nissue; we offer no alibis. Had it<br />\nbeen an overwhelming victory for<br />\nthe 'Varsity, we would voice the<br />\nsame complaint against dirty<br />\nplaying. The Schmeissers and<br />\nReaney Wolfe must have felt<br />\ndeeply the perversion into such<br />\nchannels of the game they have<br />\ndone so much to foster; and, indeed, they had no hesitancy in expressing themselves.<br />\nSeveral midshipmen, after the<br />\ngame admitted that from the<br />\nstandpoint of lacrosse, Navy was<br />\noutplayed; and another advanced<br />\nthe unique theory that those Navy<br />\nmen that had a grudge against the<br />\nworld in general went out for lacrosse as a means of venting their<br />\nspleen. At all events, whatever<br />\nthe molly& of the Annapolis<br />\ntwelve, Saturday's exhibition is a<br />\nblot upon the athletic fame of the<br />\nNaval Academy; and should a<br />\nrepetition of the affair ever occur<br />\nwhere Hopkins is concerned, athletic relations between the two institutions should promptly be<br />\nsevered.<br />\nAs for the 'Varsity, they played<br />\nthe game of their lives and stood<br />\nup with the old Hopkins spirit<br />\nunder the unnecessary punishment. Boys, we're all mighty<br />\ndamned proud of you!<br />\n<br />\nShall We Keep Up Our Stride?<br />\n<br />\nHopkins may well be proud of<br />\nher patriotic achievements; she<br />\ncannot afford to fall down on the<br />\npresent test. We shall not attempt to give the reasons for subscribing to the Victory Loan, for<br />\nthey have been and will be fully<br />\npresented to us all. Suffice it to<br />\nsay that although the stimulus<br />\nof actual hostilities has been taken<br />\naway, the Fifth Loan has a purpose perhaps even loftier than<br />\nthat of its predecessors.<br />\nA large portion of the loan is<br />\nto be used for the rehabilitation of<br />\nwounded Americans. We, nearly<br />\nall of whom have not endured the<br />\nhardships of the trenches, can<br />\nhardly put ourselves in the places<br />\nof the returned hero with the<br />\nstripe on the right arm, perhaps<br />\nblinded or maimed for life.

Hopkins<br />\nshortly afterwards tied the score<br />\nwith another shot from Baxley's<br />\nstick, and the half ended with the<br />\nscore 2 to 2. The playing of both<br />\nsides was good in this half, and<br />\nfree from any uncalled for roughness.<br />\nWith the opening of the second<br />\nhalf, the slashing began, and<br />\n\"Eggie\" Sutton chanced to be the<br />\nfirst victim, receiving a nasty<br />\nscalp cut. This was fixed, and<br />\nplay began again. Defandorf got<br />\nloose and slipped a beautiful shot<br />\npast the Navy goal tender. As a<br />\nreward for this, one of the large<br />\nNavy defense men laid him out<br />\nwith a blow on the head. From<br />\nthat time on the game ceased to<br />\nbe lacrosse from a Navy point of<br />\nview, and football and wrestling<br />\nmen came in very handily for the<br />\nwork which followed. Sutton received his second smash on the<br />\nhead and was forced to retire from<br />\nthe game. Baxley, Beall, Defandorf and Silberstein went down,<br />\nbut came back after brief intermissions.<br />\nAfter such work the Hopkins<br />\nattack lost its punch and had little chance to score. The play hovered about Hopkins' goal for ten<br />\nminutes with no score, and in this<br />\nconnection a word of praise should<br />\nbe given to Daugherty for the brilliant game he played all the way<br />\nthrough. The close defense also<br />\nplayed exceptionally well. However, the story is told by three<br />\ngoals by the Middies in the last<br />\nfour minutes, making the final<br />\ncount 5 to 3 in Navy's favor.<br />\nThe 'Varsity played a beautiful<br />\ngame under exceptional conditions, and showed much spirit and<br />\nfight.

With<br />\ntwo down, Wallace lined out a<br />\ndouble to left, Benson was hit,<br />\nand Littman drew a pass.

Benson<br />\nbeat out a grounder to short, and<br />\npilfered second. Littman failed<br />\nto connect with the ball, and Sharretts lifted it over the center fielder's head for a double, scoring<br />\nBenson. However, he tried to<br />\nstretch it into a triple and was<br />\ncaught, Snyder to Eiseman to<br />\nHartshorn.<br />\nHopkins staged a feeble rally<br />\nin the ninth when, with two down,<br />\nRiggs in attempting to pocket<br />\nSharrett's easy fly, let it hit the<br />\nground.

D., Librarian of Princeton University.)<br />\nSomebody has put up to the<br />\nUniversity Librarian the question:<br />\nhow shall a freshman go to work<br />\nto get the best use out of the library during his course. The idea<br />\nwas that a man enters college<br />\nwith a vague idea that the library<br />\nis for use and that it might be<br />\nused to better fit him for life<br />\nwork, or even to help him to enjoy his college life itself, if he<br />\nonly knew how to go to work at it.<br />\nThe possible uses of the library<br />\nare as various as the men and<br />\ntheir special interest. The uses<br />\nmade by research professors and<br />\ngraduate students for the discovery of new knowledge is one<br />\nthing; the use by professors for<br />\nstudents in aid of class room<br />\nwork is another, and the free use<br />\nof the library by a student for<br />\nhis voluntary activities and private tastes is another, or rather<br />\ntwo more.<br />\nUse for assigned reading may<br />\nbe left out of account. The professors will tell about this, inch<br />\nby inch. It is to the matter of<br />\nfree use by a man on his own<br />\ninitiative that this question<br />\npoints, and, useful as a library is<br />\nfor organized teaching and learning, and fundamental as it is for<br />\ngraduate or undergraduate directed research, its best use for<br />\nthe undergraduate, is its voluntary use.<br />\n* * *<br />\nThe habit of merely looking<br />\nover the literature or even the<br />\ntitles of the books and periodical<br />\narticles bearing on the questions<br />\ninvolved, is one of the very best<br />\npossible ways of stimulating<br />\nthought and suggesting points of<br />\nview. Especially in these modern<br />\ndays when every one is after some<br />\nnew thing and modern points of<br />\nview, it is in the periodical articles that he must find it. Merely<br />\nto look over the periodical indexes, therefore, under any topic<br />\nsuggest twenty variations,<br />\nmay<br />\n,<br />\naspects or points of view, and the<br />\nhabit of so doing is invaluable.<br />\nIt follows, too, that the very frequent running in to glance over<br />\nthe periodicals which handle the<br />\ntopics involved is the greatest<br />\npossible contribution to a fresh<br />\nintellectual interest in these topics, and this is after all the main<br />\nthing all along the line. Whatever will kindle the intellectual<br />\ninterest helps towards good use\u2014<br />\ninterest kindled, usefulness follows almost without effort.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nlege curriculum and would add to<br />\nit a capacity for understanding<br />\nand 'taking interest immeasurable<br />\nin terms of arithmetic.<br />\nNo doubt, however, the best use<br />\nthat a freshman can plan to make<br />\nof a library his whole course long<br />\nis not to browse over good books<br />\nbut to seek out all the best books<br />\nand read at least a few of the<br />\nvery best. By this is meant to<br />\nlook over with a certain amount<br />\nof care some of the very best elementary looks on all matters of<br />\nscience or history, literature, or<br />\nreligion, which do not come<br />\nwithin the field of his courses,<br />\ndoing this as a part of his fifteen<br />\nminutes a day, or putting in all<br />\nhis spare time on it\u2014if he finds<br />\nmatters of special interest\u2014when<br />\nhe has the spare time. It means<br />\nstill more, however, the frequent<br />\nhandling of the books which are<br />\nrecognized as the very best, that<br />\nis to say, the classics of literature, ancient and modern. Of<br />\ncourse, the average freshman has<br />\nno use to begin with for these<br />\nclassics. The use even of the<br />\nEnglish classics is an acquired<br />\ntaste. The taste is one, however,<br />\nwhich grows very fast with widening interest in all aspects of<br />\nhuman life and thought. The reason of the value of the classics<br />\nis that they are concentrated<br />\nfood, all such books are a survival of the fittest ttnd they are<br />\nthe fittest because they concentrate in themselves the largest<br />\namount of human experience.<br />\nWhat they are is what human<br />\nexperience from the beginning of<br />\nthe world has found true. Their<br />\nvalue is proved by the fact of<br />\ntheir survival. For this very reason, however, they are strong<br />\nmeat for beginners. Many never<br />\ngrow up to really enjoy even their<br />\nShakespeare, and it may , be<br />\ndoubted whether they can hope<br />\nto without some wide practice in<br />\nthe more diluted literature of humanity\u2014Tennyson, Kipling, Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, Archibald Marshall.<br />\nThe most important way of using the library is, after all, simply<br />\nusing it. The mere habit of use<br />\ndevelops ways of use. A man<br />\ncannot systematically make a<br />\npoint of being among books without finding ways in which their<br />\nuse profits him. The more he<br />\nhandles the tools of using such<br />\nas the author and subject catalogues, the indexes to periodicals,<br />\nand the reference books in general,<br />\nso that he is able at any time,<br />\nwith the least expenditure of effort, to get what he wants over<br />\nthe counter or from the books on<br />\nopen shelves, the greater the value<br />\nand interest of use becomes. It<br />\nis curious to one who deals with<br />\nsuch things to note how skill<br />\nmultiplies interest as well as results.\u2014The Daily Princetonian.<br />\n<br />\nSOCIAL SCIENCE CLUB MEETS;<br />\nOFFICERS ARE ELECTED.<br />\n<br />\nEmbryo Engineers Witness Launching<br />\nof Steel Ship.<br />\n<br />\nAt the first meeting of the Social Science Club, held last week,<br />\nFrank Morley, Jr, was elected<br />\npresident; M.

Those<br />\nwho had attended the Aldred lecture on shipbuilding began to look<br />\nfor the smoke that would indicate<br />\nthat the high friction was burning the wood; the others watched<br />\nthe big wave pushed up by the<br />\nstern of the ship. After the ship<br />\nleft the ways, waiting tugs came<br />\nup, took the cables that were<br />\nthrown to them, and guided the<br />\nship around into the channel.<br />\nBefore the launching, the budding engineers were taken around<br />\nthe plant. The large drydock with<br />\na Norwegian ship on the blocks,<br />\nwas the first object of interest.<br />\nThe men were replacing a number<br />\nof bent plates, the accident being<br />\ncaused (according to several wild.<br />\nconjectures) by a torpedo, or maybe a typhoon. After this, they were<br />\nshown the mold-loft, where the<br />\nwooden templates were being<br />\nmade.

Friday will be a day of<br />\nrest for the team, and on Saturday morning they will journey to<br />\nNew Haven to tackle the Yale<br />\nnine.'<br />\nThe team will return to New<br />\nYork Sunday morning and will<br />\nremain there Sunday and Monday.

In<br />\nthe past the Hopkins team has<br />\nremained at home during the<br />\nEaster holidays to play various<br />\nnorthern colleges. When it was<br />\nlearned, however, that Yale, Harvard and the other large colleges<br />\nwere not coming south this year,<br />\nit was decided to \u2022go north to<br />\nplay them. As a result of this<br />\ndecision, a game was booked with<br />\nYale early this year, and then an<br />\nattempt was made to schedule a<br />\ngame with Harvard at Cambridge.<br />\nHarvard, however, stated that<br />\nthey could play Hopkins on Saturday, April 19, the date of the<br />\nalready scheduled Yale-Hopkins<br />\nUnfortunately, neither<br />\ngame.<br />\nYale nor Harvard could change<br />\nthe date; hence a game could not<br />\nbe secured with Harvard.<br />\nIt was at first planned to play<br />\nsix games on the tour, but it was<br />\nthought that this would be a little too hard on the twirlers, and,<br />\nas a result, the number of the<br />\ngames was cut down to four.<br />\nHoly Cross College, which had<br />\none of the best college baseball<br />\nteams in the country last year,<br />\nwrote to the Hopkins manager<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nasking for a game on Monday,<br />\nApril 21, and while no definite<br />\ndecision has as yet been reached,<br />\nit is thought probable that the<br />\ngame will be booked.<br />\nThe record the team will make<br />\non the trip of course cannot' be<br />\nforetold. Coach Eddie Hooper<br />\nand Captain Littman both feel,<br />\nhowever, that if the team has good<br />\npitching it will make an enviable<br />\nrecord. Judefind and Love, two<br />\nright-handers, and Wallace, who<br />\nis a southpaw, will be taken on<br />\nthe trip, and all ,of them are in<br />\nexcellent form. Judefind's curve<br />\nball is breaking better this year<br />\nthan ever, and he has lost none<br />\nof his speed or cunning. Love is<br />\nalso going ,along in wonderful<br />\nshape. With excellent control<br />\nthis year he knows how to mix<br />\nup his wares to the discouragement of the opposing batters<br />\nWallace is a find from the ,Medical school, and is perfectly capable of holding his own in fast<br />\ncompany.<br />\nSince all the colleges that will<br />\nbe met on the trip have strong<br />\nteams, Hopkins will indeed have<br />\nmade an excellent record if it can<br />\ncome back with a string of victories. Yale and Columbia always have excellent teams.<br />\nSwarthmore, however, is not to<br />\nbe overlooked. The Quakers had<br />\na splendid nine last year, the<br />\nmainstay of which was the battery, which, incidentally, was the<br />\nbest college battery in the country. While Ogden, their star<br />\ntwirler, is not back at college this<br />\nyear, having joined the New York<br />\nNationals at the close of Swarthmore's season last year, their<br />\ncatcher and practically all the<br />\nrest of the team are back in college.

Neither the<br />\ntrustees of the University nor the<br />\nfaculty of the medical school<br />\nknow anything about the invitation, and it is thought that a mistake has been made, though it is<br />\nconsidered possible by some that<br />\nDr. Welch may have extended an<br />\ninvitation. Dr. Welch is now in<br />\nEurope, so that this possibility<br />\ncannot be immediately verified.<br />\nSir Arthur Newsholme is said<br />\nto be the most conspicuous of all<br />\nthe men in the medical profession<br />\nin England in such work as the<br />\nRockefeller School of Hygiene is<br />\nplanning to do in this country,<br />\nand his acquisition by the Hopkins school would attract attention all over the world.<br />\n<br />\nThe, track team is all set for<br />\nthe meet with Swarthmore this<br />\nSaturday at Homewood field, and<br />\nif the weather gives the men a\u2022<br />\ndry field the events will be run<br />\noff in very fast time. With a<br />\nlarge squad of men to choose<br />\nfrom, Mr. England has picked a<br />\nteam which from all advanced<br />\ndope ought to win by a safe<br />\nmargin.<br />\nFor the one hundred yard dash<br />\nHopkins has a strong trio in B.<br />\nSmith, Van Ness and Crist. Although all of these men can do<br />\nthe distance in around ten-one or<br />\ntwo, it is very probable that Crist<br />\nwill lead the field at the finish.<br />\nTo save Smith for later events<br />\nthe 220 entries will be Van Ness,<br />\nCrist and either Hazeltine or<br />\nDriver. For ;the quarter mile<br />\nevent two of the men from the<br />\nmembers of the championship<br />\nmile relay team will line up at<br />\nthe start, and judging from the<br />\neasy fashion in which Hopkins<br />\ncaptured this event last year, first<br />\nand second places may be counted<br />\nupon.<br />\nThe distant events will have<br />\ntheir entries somewhat changed<br />\nfrom the line-ups of former meets,<br />\nas Captain Smith, who, it seems,<br />\ncan win in any distance from the<br />\none hundred yard dash to a sixmile cross-country run, has shown<br />\nin trials his ability to beat the<br />\nHopkins record in this distance<br />\non a dry track. His running<br />\nmates will be either Bartels or L.<br />\nCattanach. The mile run will<br />\ngive Swarthmore no little concern<br />\nthis year with Bartels, Norwood<br />\nand Mullikin entered, especially as<br />\nBartels and Mullikin have, respectively, shared the honors of first<br />\nplace in the S. A. I. A. A. mile<br />\nin the last two years. The two;<br />\nmile event will leave the odds to<br />\nSwarthmore, for although Rivkin<br />\nand Graves are good men they<br />\nwill be a trifle young to go<br />\nagainst the veterans of the Pennsylvania team. M. Firor, last<br />\nyear's captain, and R. Wood, the<br />\nfreshman star, will be entered in<br />\nthe hurdles; last year Firor took<br />\nfirst in both events without a<br />\nteam mate, so that this year it<br />\nseems as though both places will<br />\ncome our way.<br />\nFor the field events Leadbetter<br />\nis a sure winner in the shot and<br />\ndiscus, while eaulkins will help<br />\nhim out in the weight throwing,<br />\nand G. Cattanach can be counted<br />\nupon to run a close second with<br />\nthe discus. Seagraves and tevenson will share the pole vault,<br />\nand although Swarthmore has<br />\nseveral strong men, a first or second ought to fall our way. Firor,<br />\nof course, can be counted upon<br />\nfor the high jump, having again<br />\nas a mate R. Wood, and possibly<br />\nNorwood.

French Writes About<br />\nTocqueville Medal.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014At the time appointed for<br />\nthe preliminary trials for the 1919<br />\nTocqueville contest, so few candidates appeared that the committee was unwilling to proceed with<br />\nthe trial. Unless greater interest<br />\nis shown by the undergraduates<br />\nof this year, no 1919 medal will<br />\nbe awarded. I am reluctant to believe that so important a prize is<br />\nregarded with indifference by so<br />\nmany competent men. The Tocqueville medal has an international significance \u2014 not lessened by<br />\nthe events of the past five years\u2014<br />\nin that it is the gift of the Baron<br />\nPierre de Coubertin, of Paris,<br />\ntransmitted to the. University<br />\nthrough the French Government<br />\nand our own Department of State.<br />\nIt is one of five such medals, differently named, given by the same<br />\n\u2022 donor to American colleges. Harvard, Princeton and Johns Hopkins are the threo colleges in the<br />\nEast selected to receive these<br />\nprizes; Tulane is the one Southern college chosen; and Leland<br />\nStanford and the University of<br />\nCalifornia compete jointly for the<br />\nfifth medal. The winning of the<br />\nTocqueville medal, therefore, confers a distinction which any ambitious student may very properly<br />\ncovet.

As indicative<br />\nof the unanimously high regard in<br />\nwhich Miss Walter's services are<br />\nregarded, the exclamation of one<br />\nof the players is significant:<br />\n\"Now, I wonder where we'd be<br />\nwithout Miss Walter!\"<br />\nThe male parts are well played,<br />\nwith Carneal, Leber, Morriss,<br />\nHeiner, Trew and Simon filling<br />\nthe roles.

They will<br />\nproceed direct to Callao, Peru, via<br />\nthe Panama Canal. After establishing relations with the geologists of the Peruvian Mining<br />\nBureau, they will cross the western range of the Andes on the<br />\nOroga railroad, which is the highest railroad in the world, climbing to an altitude of 15,865 feet<br />\nand continue to its terminus at<br />\nHuancayo.

From<br />\nPisco the party will proceed to<br />\nBollendo by steamer, and thence<br /><br />\nby rail to Lake Titicaca, the highest body of navigable water in<br />\nthe world. Though lying nestled<br />\nin the Andes at an elevation of<br />\n13,000 feet, so large is this intramountain lake that the trip<br />\nacross requires a night's ride by<br />\nsteamer.

Claxton talked at the<br />\nLife Work Lecture last Tuesday.<br />\nMr. Claxton gave these three<br />\nquestions for consideration before<br />\ndeciding on a life work: (1)<br />\nWhat can be accomplished for<br />\nothers by doing the work? (2)<br />\nHow much pleasure and enjoyment can be got for oneself?<br />\n(3) Can a decent living be made<br />\nin the work?<br />\nIn answer to the question of<br />\nwhat can be done for others, Mr.<br />\nClaxton emphasized the tremendous need of education brought on<br />\nby the war. The war has democratized the world and illiterate<br />\npeople cannot function in a democracy. The whole world must<br />\nbe educated so that the democracies may succeed in giving their<br />\npeople prosperity. The war has<br />\ngreatly cut down the man power<br />\nof the world. To replace this,<br />\nlabor-saving machines must be<br />\nused and this involves teaching<br />\nlaborers to run the machines.<br />\nThe pleasures of the school<br />\nteacher are very great.

Stuart, '20.<br />\nBALTIMORE, MD., APRIL 15, 1919<br />\nThe Pride of the Navy.<br /><br />\nWe are neither poor sports nor<br />\nhard losers. We have gracefully<br />\nsuffered defeats enough to refute<br />\nthat charge, for \"Palnutm qui<br />\nmeruit ferat\" has always been the<br />\nHopkins motto, especially in regard to athletic contests. The<br />\nNavy lacrosse game\u2014if it can be<br />\ncalled a game\u2014should not, however, fall under the category of<br />\nthose which Hopkins has lost because of the clean, superior play<br />\nof her opponents. The Academy<br />\nhas sustained a disgrace which<br />\ncannot easily be wiped out.<br />\nThe first half of the game,<br />\nthough bitterly contested, was free<br />\nfrom the terrific slugging that<br />\ncharacterized the last few minutes<br />\nof play. Though the Navy brand<br />\nof lacrosse did not have the sportsmanlike character of that of Lehigh and other Hopkins opponents, still we should have registered no kick had the remainder<br />\nof the game been so played. At<br />\nthe end of the half, the score stood<br />\ntwo all. After much seesawing<br />\nof the ball, Hopkins finally netted<br />\nanother goal. Then a peculiar psychological factor entered in. We<br />\nshall pay the big Navy team the<br />\ndelicate compliment that they are<br />\ndistinctly unlike the Huns, who,<br />\nformer prisoners in their camps<br />\ntell us, were astoundingly arrogant and brutal when winning,<br />\nbut cajolingly gentle when they<br />\nsaw they had lost. Navy, seeing<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nthat the enemy was in the lead<br />\nand that there were only seven<br />\nmore minutei to play, was, in the<br />\nliteral sense, out for blood.<br />\n\"Eggie\" Sutton was knocked<br />\nout with a deep cut on the head,<br />\nand time was called till it could<br />\nbe bandaged. When he .returned<br />\nto the game, his bandaged head<br />\nwas noticeably a target for the<br />\nAnnapolis stickmen. After sustaining repeated blows on this injured member, he finally fell under a particularly vicious swing,<br />\nand, with blood flowing freely, was<br />\ncarried from the field.<br />\nFour other Black and Blue<br />\nstickwielders \u2014 Defandorf, Beall,<br />\nBaxley and Silberstein, far from<br />\nthe largest men on the team, the<br />\nlatter with wide open cuts on the<br />\nhead \u2014 were in quick succession<br />\nlaid out on the field. Hoffman,<br />\nalso, received a nasty gash on the<br />\ncheek. Time was repeatedy called,<br />\nthese men pluckily coming back<br />\nfor more, and several of the Navy<br />\nteam were ejected for a few minutes. But why go into the details? It was pronounced by experts the finest exhibition of dirty<br />\nplaying they had ever seen.<br />\nNavy had an overwhelming<br />\nshare of weight and brawn, which<br />\nthey figured they could use to advantage. Had it come to a mutual slugging match, they would<br />\nhave had the edge. As it was onesided slugging, not a Navy man<br />\nwas knocked out or badly cut<br />\nwhile many of the Black and Blue<br />\nwill show for many a day that<br />\nthey were in a dirty game. Many<br />\nof the cuts were received by the<br />\nHopkins stickers after they had<br />\ngotten the ball away.<br />\nThe score has no bearing on the<br />\nissue; we offer no alibis. Had it<br />\nbeen an overwhelming victory for<br />\nthe 'Varsity, we would voice the<br />\nsame complaint against dirty<br />\nplaying. The Schmeissers and<br />\nReaney Wolfe must have felt<br />\ndeeply the perversion into such<br />\nchannels of the game they have<br />\ndone so much to foster; and, indeed, they had no hesitancy in expressing themselves.<br />\nSeveral midshipmen, after the<br />\ngame admitted that from the<br />\nstandpoint of lacrosse, Navy was<br />\noutplayed; and another advanced<br />\nthe unique theory that those Navy<br />\nmen that had a grudge against the<br />\nworld in general went out for lacrosse as a means of venting their<br />\nspleen. At all events, whatever<br />\nthe molly&amp; of the Annapolis<br />\ntwelve, Saturday's exhibition is a<br />\nblot upon the athletic fame of the<br />\nNaval Academy; and should a<br />\nrepetition of the affair ever occur<br />\nwhere Hopkins is concerned, athletic relations between the two institutions should promptly be<br />\nsevered.<br />\nAs for the 'Varsity, they played<br />\nthe game of their lives and stood<br />\nup with the old Hopkins spirit<br />\nunder the unnecessary punishment. Boys, we're all mighty<br />\ndamned proud of you!<br /><br />\nShall We Keep Up Our Stride?<br /><br />\nHopkins may well be proud of<br />\nher patriotic achievements; she<br />\ncannot afford to fall down on the<br />\npresent test. We shall not attempt to give the reasons for subscribing to the Victory Loan, for<br />\nthey have been and will be fully<br />\npresented to us all. Suffice it to<br />\nsay that although the stimulus<br />\nof actual hostilities has been taken<br />\naway, the Fifth Loan has a purpose perhaps even loftier than<br />\nthat of its predecessors.<br />\nA large portion of the loan is<br />\nto be used for the rehabilitation of<br />\nwounded Americans. We, nearly<br />\nall of whom have not endured the<br />\nhardships of the trenches, can<br />\nhardly put ourselves in the places<br />\nof the returned hero with the<br />\nstripe on the right arm, perhaps<br />\nblinded or maimed for life.

No orders must be given<br />\nuntil they are known to be correct, and, if errors are made, the<br />\nyoung engineer must shoulder his<br />\nOwn responsibility. Courtesy is<br />\none quality that must not be neglected, both ill one's contact with<br />\nhis associates or with the men<br />\nU nder him. Observation of every<br />\npart of the work must be cultivated, because it has often happened that young engineers, by<br />\ncorrecting small errors have enabled their firms to save a great<br />\ndeal of money.<br />\nis the \"mucilaginous cuticular investment in which the body of<br />\nan appendicularoid tunicate is<br />\nlodged,\" there'is apparently nothing in association with the admitted fact that a Barn can house<br />\na trophy room.<br /><br />\nTennis Match Dates Announced.<br /><br />\nThe tennis team has just one<br />\nmore week in which to fit itself<br />\nfor the opening game with Navy,<br />\nat Annapolis, on April 19.<br />\nFor the-past three weeks Captain Keyes has been kept busy<br />\ntrying to pick out the men he shall<br />\nsemi to play Navy.

Hopkins<br />\nshortly afterwards tied the score<br />\nwith another shot from Baxley's<br />\nstick, and the half ended with the<br />\nscore 2 to 2. The playing of both<br />\nsides was good in this half, and<br />\nfree from any uncalled for roughness.<br />\nWith the opening of the second<br />\nhalf, the slashing began, and<br />\n\"Eggie\" Sutton chanced to be the<br />\nfirst victim, receiving a nasty<br />\nscalp cut. This was fixed, and<br />\nplay began again. Defandorf got<br />\nloose and slipped a beautiful shot<br />\npast the Navy goal tender. As a<br />\nreward for this, one of the large<br />\nNavy defense men laid him out<br />\nwith a blow on the head. From<br />\nthat time on the game ceased to<br />\nbe lacrosse from a Navy point of<br />\nview, and football and wrestling<br />\nmen came in very handily for the<br />\nwork which followed. Sutton received his second smash on the<br />\nhead and was forced to retire from<br />\nthe game. Baxley, Beall, Defandorf and Silberstein went down,<br />\nbut came back after brief intermissions.<br />\nAfter such work the Hopkins<br />\nattack lost its punch and had little chance to score. The play hovered about Hopkins' goal for ten<br />\nminutes with no score, and in this<br />\nconnection a word of praise should<br />\nbe given to Daugherty for the brilliant game he played all the way<br />\nthrough. The close defense also<br />\nplayed exceptionally well. However, the story is told by three<br />\ngoals by the Middies in the last<br />\nfour minutes, making the final<br />\ncount 5 to 3 in Navy's favor.<br />\nThe 'Varsity played a beautiful<br />\ngame under exceptional conditions, and showed much spirit and<br />\nfight.

With<br />\ntwo down, Wallace lined out a<br />\ndouble to left, Benson was hit,<br />\nand Littman drew a pass. Sharretts, however, grounded to Keene,<br />\nwho caught Wallace at the plate.<br />\nWallace led off in the fourth<br />\nwith a fly to Eiseman. Benson<br />\nbeat out a grounder to short, and<br />\npilfered second. Littman failed<br />\nto connect with the ball, and Sharretts lifted it over the center fielder's head for a double, scoring<br />\nBenson. However, he tried to<br />\nstretch it into a triple and was<br />\ncaught, Snyder to Eiseman to<br />\nHartshorn.<br />\nHopkins staged a feeble rally<br />\nin the ninth when, with two down,<br />\nRiggs in attempting to pocket<br />\nSharrett's easy fly, let it hit the<br />\nground.

D., Librarian of Princeton University.)<br />\nSomebody has put up to the<br />\nUniversity Librarian the question:<br />\nhow shall a freshman go to work<br />\nto get the best use out of the library during his course. The idea<br />\nwas that a man enters college<br />\nwith a vague idea that the library<br />\nis for use and that it might be<br />\nused to better fit him for life<br />\nwork, or even to help him to enjoy his college life itself, if he<br />\nonly knew how to go to work at it.<br />\nThe possible uses of the library<br />\nare as various as the men and<br />\ntheir special interest. The uses<br />\nmade by research professors and<br />\ngraduate students for the discovery of new knowledge is one<br />\nthing; the use by professors for<br />\nstudents in aid of class room<br />\nwork is another, and the free use<br />\nof the library by a student for<br />\nhis voluntary activities and private tastes is another, or rather<br />\ntwo more.<br />\nUse for assigned reading may<br />\nbe left out of account. The professors will tell about this, inch<br />\nby inch. It is to the matter of<br />\nfree use by a man on his own<br />\ninitiative that this question<br />\npoints, and, useful as a library is<br />\nfor organized teaching and learning, and fundamental as it is for<br />\ngraduate or undergraduate directed research, its best use for<br />\nthe undergraduate, is its voluntary use.<br />\n* * *<br />\nThe habit of merely looking<br />\nover the literature or even the<br />\ntitles of the books and periodical<br />\narticles bearing on the questions<br />\ninvolved, is one of the very best<br />\npossible ways of stimulating<br />\nthought and suggesting points of<br />\nview. Especially in these modern<br />\ndays when every one is after some<br />\nnew thing and modern points of<br />\nview, it is in the periodical articles that he must find it. Merely<br />\nto look over the periodical indexes, therefore, under any topic<br />\nsuggest twenty variations,<br />\nmay<br />\n,<br />\naspects or points of view, and the<br />\nhabit of so doing is invaluable.<br />\nIt follows, too, that the very frequent running in to glance over<br />\nthe periodicals which handle the<br />\ntopics involved is the greatest<br />\npossible contribution to a fresh<br />\nintellectual interest in these topics, and this is after all the main<br />\nthing all along the line. Whatever will kindle the intellectual<br />\ninterest helps towards good use\u2014<br />\ninterest kindled, usefulness follows almost without effort.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\nlege curriculum and would add to<br />\nit a capacity for understanding<br />\nand 'taking interest immeasurable<br />\nin terms of arithmetic.<br />\nNo doubt, however, the best use<br />\nthat a freshman can plan to make<br />\nof a library his whole course long<br />\nis not to browse over good books<br />\nbut to seek out all the best books<br />\nand read at least a few of the<br />\nvery best. By this is meant to<br />\nlook over with a certain amount<br />\nof care some of the very best elementary looks on all matters of<br />\nscience or history, literature, or<br />\nreligion, which do not come<br />\nwithin the field of his courses,<br />\ndoing this as a part of his fifteen<br />\nminutes a day, or putting in all<br />\nhis spare time on it\u2014if he finds<br />\nmatters of special interest\u2014when<br />\nhe has the spare time. It means<br />\nstill more, however, the frequent<br />\nhandling of the books which are<br />\nrecognized as the very best, that<br />\nis to say, the classics of literature, ancient and modern. Of<br />\ncourse, the average freshman has<br />\nno use to begin with for these<br />\nclassics. The use even of the<br />\nEnglish classics is an acquired<br />\ntaste. The taste is one, however,<br />\nwhich grows very fast with widening interest in all aspects of<br />\nhuman life and thought. The reason of the value of the classics<br />\nis that they are concentrated<br />\nfood, all such books are a survival of the fittest ttnd they are<br />\nthe fittest because they concentrate in themselves the largest<br />\namount of human experience.<br />\nWhat they are is what human<br />\nexperience from the beginning of<br />\nthe world has found true. Their<br />\nvalue is proved by the fact of<br />\ntheir survival. For this very reason, however, they are strong<br />\nmeat for beginners. Many never<br />\ngrow up to really enjoy even their<br />\nShakespeare, and it may , be<br />\ndoubted whether they can hope<br />\nto without some wide practice in<br />\nthe more diluted literature of humanity\u2014Tennyson, Kipling, Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, Archibald Marshall.<br />\nThe most important way of using the library is, after all, simply<br />\nusing it. The mere habit of use<br />\ndevelops ways of use. A man<br />\ncannot systematically make a<br />\npoint of being among books without finding ways in which their<br />\nuse profits him. The more he<br />\nhandles the tools of using such<br />\nas the author and subject catalogues, the indexes to periodicals,<br />\nand the reference books in general,<br />\nso that he is able at any time,<br />\nwith the least expenditure of effort, to get what he wants over<br />\nthe counter or from the books on<br />\nopen shelves, the greater the value<br />\nand interest of use becomes. It<br />\nis curious to one who deals with<br />\nsuch things to note how skill<br />\nmultiplies interest as well as results.\u2014The Daily Princetonian.<br /><br />\nSOCIAL SCIENCE CLUB MEETS;<br />\nOFFICERS ARE ELECTED.<br /><br />\nEmbryo Engineers Witness Launching<br />\nof Steel Ship.<br /><br />\nAt the first meeting of the Social Science Club, held last week,<br />\nFrank Morley, Jr, was elected<br />\npresident; M.

Those<br />\nwho had attended the Aldred lecture on shipbuilding began to look<br />\nfor the smoke that would indicate<br />\nthat the high friction was burning the wood; the others watched<br />\nthe big wave pushed up by the<br />\nstern of the ship. After the ship<br />\nleft the ways, waiting tugs came<br />\nup, took the cables that were<br />\nthrown to them, and guided the<br />\nship around into the channel.<br />\nBefore the launching, the budding engineers were taken around<br />\nthe plant. The large drydock with<br />\na Norwegian ship on the blocks,<br />\nwas the first object of interest.<br />\nThe men were replacing a number<br />\nof bent plates, the accident being<br />\ncaused (according to several wild.<br />\nconjectures) by a torpedo, or maybe a typhoon. After this, they were<br />\nshown the mold-loft, where the<br />\nwooden templates were being<br />\nmade.

On Thursday afternoon the<br />\nBlack and Blue ball tossers will<br />\nstack up against the strong<br />\nColumbia University nine in New<br />\nYork. Friday will be a day of<br />\nrest for the team, and on Saturday morning they will journey to<br />\nNew Haven to tackle the Yale<br />\nnine.'<br />\nThe team will return to New<br />\nYork Sunday morning and will<br />\nremain there Sunday and Monday. They will leave the big city<br />\nThesday morning for Swartlunore,<br />\nremaining there the night after<br />\nthe game with Swarthmore.<br />\nWednesday morning the nine will<br />\nleave for Haverford, Pa., to play<br />\nthe Haverford team that afternoon.<br />\nThis is the first time that the<br />\nHopkins baseball team has ever<br />\nundertaken so long a trip, and<br />\nthe team very naturally is glad<br />\nthat the change was made. In<br />\nthe past the Hopkins team has<br />\nremained at home during the<br />\nEaster holidays to play various<br />\nnorthern colleges. When it was<br />\nlearned, however, that Yale, Harvard and the other large colleges<br />\nwere not coming south this year,<br />\nit was decided to \u2022go north to<br />\nplay them. As a result of this<br />\ndecision, a game was booked with<br />\nYale early this year, and then an<br />\nattempt was made to schedule a<br />\ngame with Harvard at Cambridge.<br />\nHarvard, however, stated that<br />\nthey could play Hopkins on Saturday, April 19, the date of the<br />\nalready scheduled Yale-Hopkins<br />\nUnfortunately, neither<br />\ngame.<br />\nYale nor Harvard could change<br />\nthe date; hence a game could not<br />\nbe secured with Harvard.<br />\nIt was at first planned to play<br />\nsix games on the tour, but it was<br />\nthought that this would be a little too hard on the twirlers, and,<br />\nas a result, the number of the<br />\ngames was cut down to four.<br />\nHoly Cross College, which had<br />\none of the best college baseball<br />\nteams in the country last year,<br />\nwrote to the Hopkins manager<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nasking for a game on Monday,<br />\nApril 21, and while no definite<br />\ndecision has as yet been reached,<br />\nit is thought probable that the<br />\ngame will be booked.<br />\nThe record the team will make<br />\non the trip of course cannot' be<br />\nforetold. Coach Eddie Hooper<br />\nand Captain Littman both feel,<br />\nhowever, that if the team has good<br />\npitching it will make an enviable<br />\nrecord. Judefind and Love, two<br />\nright-handers, and Wallace, who<br />\nis a southpaw, will be taken on<br />\nthe trip, and all ,of them are in<br />\nexcellent form. Judefind's curve<br />\nball is breaking better this year<br />\nthan ever, and he has lost none<br />\nof his speed or cunning. Love is<br />\nalso going ,along in wonderful<br />\nshape. With excellent control<br />\nthis year he knows how to mix<br />\nup his wares to the discouragement of the opposing batters<br />\nWallace is a find from the ,Medical school, and is perfectly capable of holding his own in fast<br />\ncompany.<br />\nSince all the colleges that will<br />\nbe met on the trip have strong<br />\nteams, Hopkins will indeed have<br />\nmade an excellent record if it can<br />\ncome back with a string of victories. Yale and Columbia always have excellent teams.<br />\nSwarthmore, however, is not to<br />\nbe overlooked. The Quakers had<br />\na splendid nine last year, the<br />\nmainstay of which was the battery, which, incidentally, was the<br />\nbest college battery in the country. While Ogden, their star<br />\ntwirler, is not back at college this<br />\nyear, having joined the New York<br />\nNationals at the close of Swarthmore's season last year, their<br />\ncatcher and practically all the<br />\nrest of the team are back in college.

Neither the<br />\ntrustees of the University nor the<br />\nfaculty of the medical school<br />\nknow anything about the invitation, and it is thought that a mistake has been made, though it is<br />\nconsidered possible by some that<br />\nDr. Welch may have extended an<br />\ninvitation. Dr. Welch is now in<br />\nEurope, so that this possibility<br />\ncannot be immediately verified.<br />\nSir Arthur Newsholme is said<br />\nto be the most conspicuous of all<br />\nthe men in the medical profession<br />\nin England in such work as the<br />\nRockefeller School of Hygiene is<br />\nplanning to do in this country,<br />\nand his acquisition by the Hopkins school would attract attention all over the world.<br /><br />\nThe, track team is all set for<br />\nthe meet with Swarthmore this<br />\nSaturday at Homewood field, and<br />\nif the weather gives the men a\u2022<br />\ndry field the events will be run<br />\noff in very fast time. With a<br />\nlarge squad of men to choose<br />\nfrom, Mr. England has picked a<br />\nteam which from all advanced<br />\ndope ought to win by a safe<br />\nmargin.<br />\nFor the one hundred yard dash<br />\nHopkins has a strong trio in B.<br />\nSmith, Van Ness and Crist. Although all of these men can do<br />\nthe distance in around ten-one or<br />\ntwo, it is very probable that Crist<br />\nwill lead the field at the finish.<br />\nTo save Smith for later events<br />\nthe 220 entries will be Van Ness,<br />\nCrist and either Hazeltine or<br />\nDriver. For ;the quarter mile<br />\nevent two of the men from the<br />\nmembers of the championship<br />\nmile relay team will line up at<br />\nthe start, and judging from the<br />\neasy fashion in which Hopkins<br />\ncaptured this event last year, first<br />\nand second places may be counted<br />\nupon.<br />\nThe distant events will have<br />\ntheir entries somewhat changed<br />\nfrom the line-ups of former meets,<br />\nas Captain Smith, who, it seems,<br />\ncan win in any distance from the<br />\none hundred yard dash to a sixmile cross-country run, has shown<br />\nin trials his ability to beat the<br />\nHopkins record in this distance<br />\non a dry track. His running<br />\nmates will be either Bartels or L.<br />\nCattanach. The mile run will<br />\ngive Swarthmore no little concern<br />\nthis year with Bartels, Norwood<br />\nand Mullikin entered, especially as<br />\nBartels and Mullikin have, respectively, shared the honors of first<br />\nplace in the S. A. I. A. A. mile<br />\nin the last two years. The two;<br />\nmile event will leave the odds to<br />\nSwarthmore, for although Rivkin<br />\nand Graves are good men they<br />\nwill be a trifle young to go<br />\nagainst the veterans of the Pennsylvania team. M. Firor, last<br />\nyear's captain, and R. Wood, the<br />\nfreshman star, will be entered in<br />\nthe hurdles; last year Firor took<br />\nfirst in both events without a<br />\nteam mate, so that this year it<br />\nseems as though both places will<br />\ncome our way.<br />\nFor the field events Leadbetter<br />\nis a sure winner in the shot and<br />\ndiscus, while eaulkins will help<br />\nhim out in the weight throwing,<br />\nand G. Cattanach can be counted<br />\nupon to run a close second with<br />\nthe discus. Seagraves and tevenson will share the pole vault,<br />\nand although Swarthmore has<br />\nseveral strong men, a first or second ought to fall our way. Firor,<br />\nof course, can be counted upon<br />\nfor the high jump, having again<br />\nas a mate R. Wood, and possibly<br />\nNorwood.

French Writes About<br />\nTocqueville Medal.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nSir\u2014At the time appointed for<br />\nthe preliminary trials for the 1919<br />\nTocqueville contest, so few candidates appeared that the committee was unwilling to proceed with<br />\nthe trial. Unless greater interest<br />\nis shown by the undergraduates<br />\nof this year, no 1919 medal will<br />\nbe awarded. I am reluctant to believe that so important a prize is<br />\nregarded with indifference by so<br />\nmany competent men. The Tocqueville medal has an international significance \u2014 not lessened by<br />\nthe events of the past five years\u2014<br />\nin that it is the gift of the Baron<br />\nPierre de Coubertin, of Paris,<br />\ntransmitted to the. University<br />\nthrough the French Government<br />\nand our own Department of State.<br />\nIt is one of five such medals, differently named, given by the same<br />\n\u2022 donor to American colleges. Harvard, Princeton and Johns Hopkins are the threo colleges in the<br />\nEast selected to receive these<br />\nprizes; Tulane is the one Southern college chosen; and Leland<br />\nStanford and the University of<br />\nCalifornia compete jointly for the<br />\nfifth medal. The winning of the<br />\nTocqueville medal, therefore, confers a distinction which any ambitious student may very properly<br />\ncovet. Why so few have seemed<br />\nthis year to covet it I cannot understand, unless the men who<br />\nshould be interested in such matters have not been aware of its<br />\nimportance.<br />\nThat the lethargy of 1919 has<br />\nnot existed in past years can best<br />\nbe proved by a list of the men who<br />\nhave already won the medal:<br />\n1900\u2014James Edward Routh, Jr., A.

A few minutes later Baker<br />\nadded another tally to the score.<br />\nCity was full of life and vigor,<br />\nbut the speed and stick work of<br />\nthe older men always warded off<br />\nthe danger.<br />\nCity tightened considerably in<br />\nthe second half, and it was not<br />\nuntil the latter part of the game<br />\nthat another tally was added by<br />\nBlum. Kirkpatrick, City's star<br />\ncenter, did his best to put the ball<br />\nin the net, but his efforts were in<br />\nvain.<br />\nThe line-up:<br /><br />\nBALTIMORE, MD.<br /><br />\nPrinters of Philological and<br />\nScientific Works<br />\nAmong the publications printed by us are: The<br />\nPublications of the Modern Language Association<br />\nof America. \"Johns Hopkins University Circulars,\"\"Modern Language Notes,\"''Maryland Historical Magazine,\" 'University of North Carolina<br />\nStudies in Philology\" and many other works of<br />\nsimilar character.

On May 7 the<br />\nJohns Hopkins Dramatic Club<br />\nwill present its first play, \"You<br />\nNever Can Tell.\" Any doubtful<br />\nconnection, however, between the<br />\nname and the outcome of the play<br />\nmust be emphatically denied; anyone fortunate enough to have attended a rehearsal lately can bear<br />\nwitness to the fact.<br />\nhuge success.<br />\nIn speaking with members of<br />\nthe cast, the general impression<br />\ngathered is that the one big factor in their ultimate success will<br />\nhave been the inestimable services of Miss Clementine Walter,<br />\nwho is coaching the play. Not only<br />\nher ability in coaching is praised,<br />\nbut also she has been overly generous in giving up her time and attention to the play. As indicative<br />\nof the unanimously high regard in<br />\nwhich Miss Walter's services are<br />\nregarded, the exclamation of one<br />\nof the players is significant:<br />\n\"Now, I wonder where we'd be<br />\nwithout Miss Walter!\"<br />\nThe male parts are well played,<br />\nwith Carneal, Leber, Morriss,<br />\nHeiner, Trew and Simon filling<br />\nthe roles. The Waiter (Carneal)<br />\nallti Valentine (Leber) will certainly attract especial attention.<br />\nWhen it comes to the real stuff<br />\nthough, the \"ladies\" are all there:<br />\nLewin, Burger and Norris. Say,<br />\nfellows, you never saw such a<br />\nsweet, pretty, \"bubbling over,\"<br />\ndear, lovable, little angel as Dolly,<br />\nas played by Teddy Burger; she<br />\nhas Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford all looking like old-timers!<br />\nAnd when John Lewin, as Mrs.<br />\nClandon, swishes her \"train\" of<br />\nstate, you might think you'd like<br />\nher for your mother-in-law\u2014and<br />\nyou might not! But we can't give<br />\naway the whole show.<br />\nTickets for the performance are<br />\nnow on sale at the postoffice, or by<br />\nany member of the Dramatic Club.<br />\nThe tickets are $1, they must be<br />\nexchanged for seats at Albaugh's<br />\nticket office, after April 21, where<br />\nthey will be credited for that<br />\namount toward the price of the<br />\nseat, the difference being paid<br />\nthere if a more expensive seat is<br />\ndesired.
