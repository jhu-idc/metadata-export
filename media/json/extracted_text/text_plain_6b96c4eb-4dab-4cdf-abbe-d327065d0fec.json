The changes were<br />\nrecommended in anticipation of<br />\nthe declining job market for<br />\n<br />\nPh.D.'s.<br />\n\"Within five years,\" the board<br />\nprojected, \"as few as 7000-9000<br />\nand probably no more than<br />\n15,000-20,000 new Ph.D.'s per<br />\nyear may secure employment<br />\nthat is closely related to the<br />\neducation provided in graduate<br />\nschools.\"<br />\nBy contrast, the board noted,<br />\n33,000 doctoral degrees were<br />\nawarded in 1974 and the number<br />\nmay hit 40,000 by the early<br />\n<br />\nHopkins PhD's find jobs<br />\nBy ROBBY RIGGS<br />\nDespite the national shortage<br />\nof faculty positions for Ph.D.'s,<br />\nHopkins has been relatively<br />\nits<br />\nin<br />\nplacing<br />\nsuccessful<br />\ngraduates.<br />\nIn most areas, particularly the<br />\nhumanities, the number of<br />\nopenings is considerably smaller<br />\nthis year than it was five years<br />\nLidtke,<br />\nVernon<br />\nDr.<br />\nago.<br />\nHistory<br />\nof the<br />\nChairman<br />\nDepartment, attributed this to<br />\n\"the expectations which were<br />\naroused in the 60's, leading to an<br />\noverpopulation of Ph.D.'s in the<br />\n70's.\"<br />\nHe considers the last decade to<br />\nhave been a period during which<br />\nthe number of job openings was<br />\nexceptional. The present crunch,<br />\nwhich has been on for four or<br />\nfive years, is a \"return to<br />\nnormality,\" he added.<br />\nIn the English Department, the<br />\njob situation is better this year<br />\n<br />\nJennifer bishop<br />\n<br />\nPre-med stats to be released tonight at meeting<br />\n<br />\nthan last, according to English<br />\nprofessor and placement officer,<br />\nDr. Stanley Fish.<br />\nFish cited two reasons for this.<br />\nHe noted that many large<br />\nuniversities which did not hire<br />\nEnglish faculty during the last<br />\nfew years, are not beginning to<br />\ntake on additional professors. In<br />\naddition, some universities are<br />\ntrying to save money by releasing<br />\nprofessors after five years, and<br />\nhiring new .Ph.D.'s to take their<br />\nplaces. Dr. Fish still termed the<br />\njob situation \"a buyer's market.\"<br />\nJob openings in the Romance<br />\nhave<br />\nDepartment<br />\nLanguage<br />\ndeclined in number. According to<br />\nDepartment<br />\nOlson,<br />\nPaul<br />\nChairman, many institutions have<br />\nlanguage<br />\ntheir<br />\ndropped<br />\nrequirements, causing a decline in<br />\nthe number of professors needed.<br />\nHardest hit by this trend have<br />\nbeen German and Russian, with<br />\nFrench enrollment also down.<br />\n<br />\nIn spite of the tightening job<br />\nno<br />\nmarket,<br />\nhumanities<br />\nhave<br />\nmade<br />\ndepartments<br />\nreductions in graduate student<br />\nenrollment. Lidtke ,says this is<br />\ndue to the traditionally small<br />\nenrollment at Hopkins and<br />\nbecause no increases were made<br />\nduring the boom of the 1960's..<br />\nThe History Departent places<br />\nalmost all of their small number<br />\nof students. \"Our graduates have<br />\nbeen either very good or very<br />\nlucky,\" Lidtke says. Some, he<br />\nnoted, are not teaching history,<br />\nbut are instead working in fields<br />\nsuch as government, archives, and<br />\npublishing.<br />\nIn the sciences, the placement<br />\nrate for graduate students is hard<br />\nto determine because many<br />\nstudents go into post-doctoral<br />\nThe<br />\nwork.<br />\nBiology<br />\nand<br />\nChemistry Departments estimate<br />\nthat 90% of their Ph.D.'s go on<br />\nto post-doctoral study.<br />\n<br />\n1980's.<br />\nThe percentage of Ph.D.'s who<br />\nsaid they had no specific job<br />\nprospects at the time they<br />\nobtained their degrees has<br />\nsteadily increased.<br />\nIn chemistry, for instance, the<br />\nproportion rose from 4.5% in<br />\n1968 to 17.2% in 1973. During<br />\nthe same period, the proportion<br />\nin English without jobs when<br />\nthey got their Ph.D.'s increased<br />\nfrom 3.9% to 21.5%.<br />\nTo handle this enormous<br />\nproblem, the board urged<br />\ngraduate schools to consider<br />\nacceptance of \"new clientele,\"<br />\nviz., \"older students, fully<br />\nemployed students, part-time<br />\nstudents, non-residential<br />\nstudents...\"<br />\nDr. Maurice Mandelbaum, a<br />\nmember of the panel, however,<br />\n<br />\n.Lune 11 emir<br />\n<br />\nJr*<br />\nMaurice Mandelhatim<br />\n<br />\nstated that he did not feel these<br />\nspecific recommendations were<br />\napplicable to Hopkins: \"I don't<br />\nexpect any radical change in<br />\ngraduate programs at Hopkins, or<br />\nat Princeton or Harvard.\"<br />\n\"The top twenty schools will<br />\ncontinue to produce the majority<br />\nof faculty members in major<br />\nuniversities and best liberal art5<br />\ncolleges.\"<br />\nDuring the 1960's, the rapid<br />\ngrowth of undergraduate<br />\nenrollment and of sponsored<br />\nresearch in the universities made<br />\nnew doctoral programs<br />\neconomically feasible. Also,<br />\ngraduate students were needed as<br />\nteaching assistants, as well as<br />\nresearch assistants on the number<br />\nof private and federally funded<br />\nprojects.<br />\nSays Mandelbaum: \"In the<br />\nsciences, a cutback in I federal'<br />\nresearch funds has greatly hurt<br />\nthose seeking employment in the<br />\nacademic fields. But still, many<br />\nPh.D.'s, e.g., in chemistry, may<br />\nfind employment in industry.\"<br />\n\"The situation is especially<br />\nsevere in the humanities and<br />\nsome social sciences, not having<br />\nthose non-academic job<br />\nmarkets.\"<br />\n\"There is an inherent ethical<br />\nquestion of whether we should<br />\n.accept the ideal graduate<br />\n-c enrollment, when we-know there<br />\n07) is very little chance of placing<br />\nt them all...There has been some<br />\nconscious effort to limit graduate<br />\nadmissions, but not enough not<br />\nenough to bridge that gap<br />\nbetween supply and demand.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fCAMPUS NOTES<br />\n<br />\npage 2inews-letterlanuary 27, 1976<br />\n<br />\nmeetings<br />\nThere will be a mandatory AED<br />\nmeeting on Tuesday, January 27 at 7<br />\np.m. in the Garrett Room.

The quality of<br />\ntelevision programming is slightly<br />\nbelow that of a Jacqueline<br />\nSusanne novel.

The American<br />\n<br />\neducational system embraced this<br />\nidea because it was economical<br />\nand easy; just send the kid away<br />\nwith paper and pencil and praise<br />\nwhatever comes back. Small<br />\nthings, like grammar and<br />\nsentence<br />\nstructure,<br />\nwere<br />\noverlooked in the stampede to<br />\nteach self-expression. And now,<br />\nwith the first generation of<br />\nAmericans under this system<br />\nreaching intellectual maturity, we<br />\ncan see that they are expressing<br />\nthemselves fully. They are<br />\nilliterates and showing it.<br />\nOnce, long ago, people<br />\nthought thats the mass media<br />\nwould be the cure-all for all our<br />\nculture's ills. Imagine what<br />\nwonderful things the mass media<br />\ncan transmit into the home of<br />\nevery American! We could be the<br />\nsmartest people in the universe!<br />\nBut the mass media failed<br />\nbecause with its overwhelming<br />\ncommercial interests there was<br />\nno room for any serious cultural<br />\ncontribution.

But that golden age has<br />\ncome to an end, according to a<br />\nreport by two Massachusetts<br />\nInstitute of Technology (MIT)<br />\nanalysts.<br />\nCollege graduates are no longer<br />\ngetting the kinds of management<br />\njobs they thought they were<br />\ntraining for because of an<br />\neconomy that has absorbed all<br />\nthe management personnel it has<br />\nroom for.

The ratio of<br />\ncollege-level jobs to the total<br />\nnumber of graduates dropped by<br />\nabout 3% between 1969 and<br />\n1974.<br />\nThe result is thzt fewer and<br />\nfewer graduates are finding<br />\ndesirable work.

The present crunch,<br />\nwhich has been on for four or<br />\nfive years, is a \"return to<br />\nnormality,\" he added.<br />\nIn the English Department, the<br />\njob situation is better this year<br /><br />\nJennifer bishop<br /><br />\nPre-med stats to be released tonight at meeting<br /><br />\nthan last, according to English<br />\nprofessor and placement officer,<br />\nDr. Stanley Fish.<br />\nFish cited two reasons for this.<br />\nHe noted that many large<br />\nuniversities which did not hire<br />\nEnglish faculty during the last<br />\nfew years, are not beginning to<br />\ntake on additional professors. In<br />\naddition, some universities are<br />\ntrying to save money by releasing<br />\nprofessors after five years, and<br />\nhiring new .Ph.D.'s to take their<br />\nplaces. Dr. Fish still termed the<br />\njob situation \"a buyer's market.\"<br />\nJob openings in the Romance<br />\nhave<br />\nDepartment<br />\nLanguage<br />\ndeclined in number. According to<br />\nDepartment<br />\nOlson,<br />\nPaul<br />\nChairman, many institutions have<br />\nlanguage<br />\ntheir<br />\ndropped<br />\nrequirements, causing a decline in<br />\nthe number of professors needed.<br />\nHardest hit by this trend have<br />\nbeen German and Russian, with<br />\nFrench enrollment also down.<br /><br />\nIn spite of the tightening job<br />\nno<br />\nmarket,<br />\nhumanities<br />\nhave<br />\nmade<br />\ndepartments<br />\nreductions in graduate student<br />\nenrollment. Lidtke ,says this is<br />\ndue to the traditionally small<br />\nenrollment at Hopkins and<br />\nbecause no increases were made<br />\nduring the boom of the 1960's..<br />\nThe History Departent places<br />\nalmost all of their small number<br />\nof students. \"Our graduates have<br />\nbeen either very good or very<br />\nlucky,\" Lidtke says. Some, he<br />\nnoted, are not teaching history,<br />\nbut are instead working in fields<br />\nsuch as government, archives, and<br />\npublishing.<br />\nIn the sciences, the placement<br />\nrate for graduate students is hard<br />\nto determine because many<br />\nstudents go into post-doctoral<br />\nThe<br />\nwork.<br />\nBiology<br />\nand<br />\nChemistry Departments estimate<br />\nthat 90% of their Ph.D.'s go on<br />\nto post-doctoral study.<br /><br />\n1980's.<br />\nThe percentage of Ph.D.'s who<br />\nsaid they had no specific job<br />\nprospects at the time they<br />\nobtained their degrees has<br />\nsteadily increased.<br />\nIn chemistry, for instance, the<br />\nproportion rose from 4.5% in<br />\n1968 to 17.2% in 1973. During<br />\nthe same period, the proportion<br />\nin English without jobs when<br />\nthey got their Ph.D.'s increased<br />\nfrom 3.9% to 21.5%.<br />\nTo handle this enormous<br />\nproblem, the board urged<br />\ngraduate schools to consider<br />\nacceptance of \"new clientele,\"<br />\nviz., \"older students, fully<br />\nemployed students, part-time<br />\nstudents, non-residential<br />\nstudents...\"<br />\nDr. Maurice Mandelbaum, a<br />\nmember of the panel, however,<br /><br />\n.Lune 11 emir<br /><br />\nJr*<br />\nMaurice Mandelhatim<br /><br />\nstated that he did not feel these<br />\nspecific recommendations were<br />\napplicable to Hopkins: \"I don't<br />\nexpect any radical change in<br />\ngraduate programs at Hopkins, or<br />\nat Princeton or Harvard.\"<br />\n\"The top twenty schools will<br />\ncontinue to produce the majority<br />\nof faculty members in major<br />\nuniversities and best liberal art5<br />\ncolleges.\"<br />\nDuring the 1960's, the rapid<br />\ngrowth of undergraduate<br />\nenrollment and of sponsored<br />\nresearch in the universities made<br />\nnew doctoral programs<br />\neconomically feasible. Also,<br />\ngraduate students were needed as<br />\nteaching assistants, as well as<br />\nresearch assistants on the number<br />\nof private and federally funded<br />\nprojects.<br />\nSays Mandelbaum: \"In the<br />\nsciences, a cutback in I federal'<br />\nresearch funds has greatly hurt<br />\nthose seeking employment in the<br />\nacademic fields. But still, many<br />\nPh.D.'s, e.g., in chemistry, may<br />\nfind employment in industry.\"<br />\n\"The situation is especially<br />\nsevere in the humanities and<br />\nsome social sciences, not having<br />\nthose non-academic job<br />\nmarkets.\"<br />\n\"There is an inherent ethical<br />\nquestion of whether we should<br />\n.accept the ideal graduate<br />\n-c enrollment, when we-know there<br />\n07) is very little chance of placing<br />\nt them all...There has been some<br />\nconscious effort to limit graduate<br />\nadmissions, but not enough not<br />\nenough to bridge that gap<br />\nbetween supply and demand.\"<br /><br />\nCAMPUS NOTES<br /><br />\npage 2inews-letterlanuary 27, 1976<br /><br />\nmeetings<br />\nThere will be a mandatory AED<br />\nmeeting on Tuesday, January 27 at 7<br />\np.m. in the Garrett Room.
