In<br />\nthis period Johns Hopkins has gone through two eras: the first, from<br />\nthe University's founding to its removal to the Homewood site; the<br />\nsecond, lasting from tile time of this removal to the present day.<br />\nNext year, with the dormitories an established fact and with an<br />\nelaborate programme of expansion, Hopkins enters upon the third<br />\nera of its existence. It will be a critical period for the undergraduate<br />\nschool. Whether the world at large will continue to regard Johns<br />\nHopkins as only a Medical School or whether the influence of the<br />\nundergraduate school will be extended, will be decided in the near<br />\nfuture.<br />\nThe result is dependent for a large part upon the undergraduate<br />\nbody.<br />\n<br />\n$3.45<br />\nis the price<br />\nCAH N'S<br />\n<br />\nUAL1TY SHOP<br />\nBaltimore and<br />\nLiberty Streets<br />\n<br />\n116 East<br />\nBaltimore St.<br />\n<br />\nCOACH SCHMEISSER<br />\n<br />\nCOACH SCHMEISSER PAYS GLOWING TRIBUTE TO<br />\nHOPKINS LACROSSE TEAM<br />\nThe Team of 1923 is the best Lacrosse Team Hopkins has ever<br />\nturned out. I say this after careful consideration, having studied my<br />\nrecords, seen the teams of the last twenty-four years in action and<br />\nknown the players all personally. Further I have talked to the important players of four more years before that and followed the best<br />\nof them in uniform. Previous to twenty-eight years ago the game<br />\nwas different.<br />\nThe 1923 aggregation has more fine players on it than any previous twelve. The team is remarkably well balanced. Every man<br />\nfrom in home to second defense inclusive can shoot goals and has<br />\ndone it. Every attack-man and part of the defense is always a scoring threat. Six out of the eight attack men are finished dodgers.<br />\nFour out of eight attack-men can shoot from both sides. The midfield, the heart of any great Lacrosse Team is very effective; two are<br />\nlong distance men, the other four fast on the sprint.<br />\nThe defense consists of nine well balanced players. An aggressive defense not a conservative one. The proper balance of speed<br />\nand weight and good stickhandlers for close work.<br />\nThere is no weak spot in the whole team. It is full of harmony,<br />\npunch, intelligence, resourcefulness and teamwork.

It has been received Westinghouse Electric and Manuhas been striving for four years and is about to undertake his life's<br />\nwith great enthusiasm on the facturing .Company and the Genwork with his long-awaited diploma beneath his arm. The world<br />\ncampus.<br />\neral Electric Company have apseems to rotate about the graduate; everyone else is forgotten<br />\nwhile HE is showered with applause, with praises and with flattery.<br /><br />\nThe Johns<br /><br />\nHopkins News-Letter<br /><br />\nWe Echo<br />\nPatrick Henry!<br /><br />\nLiberty<br />\nH AT<br /><br />\nBut the man who is particular about style will be<br />\njust as insistant as Patrick Henry about getting<br />\nthe Liberty, \u2014 it's a hat<br />\nthat stands for correctness in style and the utmost in value.<br /><br />\nHilarity and self-satisfaction, however, are not the only elements<br />\nto enter into the mind of the Senior at this time. Try as he might<br />\nto exclude them, little twinges of regret are bound to appear, regret<br />\nthat he is soon to sever connections with the Johns Hopkin4 undergraduate body; regret that the scenes of many happy moments are to<br />\nbe left behind; regret that many familiar and well-liked faces are<br />\nto be seen in the future only at widespread and infrequent intervals.<br />\nRejoicing, perhaps, predominates, but it is unmistakably intermingled<br />\nwith a certain amount of sadness.<br />\nNor do the Seniors hold a monopoly upon this latter feeling.

Our efforts, although feeble, are sincere.<br />\nThere are but two things remaining for us to say. The first is<br />\nto ask that the Class of 1923 keep in close touch with undergraduate<br />\naffairs and endeavor to form an active alumni body, devoted to the<br />\ninterests of the University. Our second duty, or may it be called a<br />\nprivilege, is to wish the members of the graduating class \"Godspeed.\"<br />\nWe do!<br /><br />\nA NEW ERA<br />\nThis issue of the News-Letter marks the close of the collegiate<br />\nyear 1922-23, the forty-sixth year of the University's existence. In<br />\nthis period Johns Hopkins has gone through two eras: the first, from<br />\nthe University's founding to its removal to the Homewood site; the<br />\nsecond, lasting from tile time of this removal to the present day.<br />\nNext year, with the dormitories an established fact and with an<br />\nelaborate programme of expansion, Hopkins enters upon the third<br />\nera of its existence. It will be a critical period for the undergraduate<br />\nschool. Whether the world at large will continue to regard Johns<br />\nHopkins as only a Medical School or whether the influence of the<br />\nundergraduate school will be extended, will be decided in the near<br />\nfuture.<br />\nThe result is dependent for a large part upon the undergraduate<br />\nbody.<br /><br />\n$3.45<br />\nis the price<br />\nCAH N'S<br /><br />\nUAL1TY SHOP<br />\nBaltimore and<br />\nLiberty Streets<br /><br />\n116 East<br />\nBaltimore St.<br /><br />\nCOACH SCHMEISSER<br /><br />\nCOACH SCHMEISSER PAYS GLOWING TRIBUTE TO<br />\nHOPKINS LACROSSE TEAM<br />\nThe Team of 1923 is the best Lacrosse Team Hopkins has ever<br />\nturned out. I say this after careful consideration, having studied my<br />\nrecords, seen the teams of the last twenty-four years in action and<br />\nknown the players all personally. Further I have talked to the important players of four more years before that and followed the best<br />\nof them in uniform. Previous to twenty-eight years ago the game<br />\nwas different.<br />\nThe 1923 aggregation has more fine players on it than any previous twelve. The team is remarkably well balanced. Every man<br />\nfrom in home to second defense inclusive can shoot goals and has<br />\ndone it. Every attack-man and part of the defense is always a scoring threat. Six out of the eight attack men are finished dodgers.<br />\nFour out of eight attack-men can shoot from both sides. The midfield, the heart of any great Lacrosse Team is very effective; two are<br />\nlong distance men, the other four fast on the sprint.<br />\nThe defense consists of nine well balanced players. An aggressive defense not a conservative one. The proper balance of speed<br />\nand weight and good stickhandlers for close work.<br />\nThere is no weak spot in the whole team. It is full of harmony,<br />\npunch, intelligence, resourcefulness and teamwork. Further it still<br />\nhas undeveloped power which will never be utilized as it is shortly<br />\nto go the way of all good college teams into the real of found remembrance.<br />\n(Signed) WM. C.
