He<br />\nalso commented that because the<br />\nundergraduate students have<br />\nbeen somewhat \"neglected\" at<br />\nHopkins, efforts on the part of<br />\nprofessors seriously interested in<br />\nteaching would be better<br />\nappreciated by students here<br />\nthan at other institutions. Dr:<br />\nFreehling added that the<br />\nadministrative workload that<br />\nplagues professors at larger<br />\nuniversities is not present at<br />\nHopkins. He explained that its<br />\nabsence allows the professor<br />\nmore time to improve his<br />\nteaching abilities by interacting<br />\nwith his students on a more<br />\npersonal basis.<br />\n\"I was hired to teach,\" Dr.<br />\n<br />\nMcCoy and Wolman<br />\ncode violations fixed<br />\nHousing code violations cited<br />\nin April 1972 for Wolman and<br />\nMcCoy Halls have been<br />\neliminated, according to Herb<br />\nFrederick, Superintendant of<br />\nHousing.<br />\nHe stated that extensive work<br />\non the fire door system in<br />\nWolman has been completed, and<br />\nthat, to his knowledge, no<br />\nfurther violations of City<br />\nHousing Codes remain.<br />\nHowever, an ongoing<br />\nmaintenance problem still<br />\nremains in both Wolman and<br />\nMcCoy he said. Frederick said<br />\nthat this problem results from<br />\nstudent life styles and the fact<br />\nthat student housing is run on a<br />\nFire door in Wolman Hall<br />\nno-profit basis. Some students in<br />\nthe past have not kept up their<br />\nend of maintenance, leaving _ Hence lower rent for University<br />\nhousing tends to result in<br />\napartments in states ot disrepair<br />\nand accumulated uncleanliness, \u2022 curtailed services.

He has taken a one-year<br />\nleave in order to complete a hook<br />\non the years between the<br />\nCompromise of 1850 and the<br />\nfiring on Fort Sumter at the<br />\noutbreak of the Civil War. The<br />\nwork is to be published late this<br />\nyear by Harper and Row.<br />\nThough his particular interest<br />\nlies in the Middle Period of<br />\nAmerican History, Dr. Freehling<br />\nexpressed eagerness for teaching<br />\nin areas other than his own. He<br />\nexplained that by branching out,<br />\na professor can rid himself of the<br />\nredundancy and tedium which<br />\nprevents a fresh approach to both<br />\nstudents and subject matter.<br />\n\"You learn from the students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"They see things that<br />\n<br />\nWilliam Freehling: \"I was hired to teach.\"<br />\nteacher as much as the student.<br />\nperhaps you have not.\"<br />\nSuch freshness of approach<br />\nIn summarizing his views on<br />\nundergraduate teaching, Dr. will undoubtedly make Dr.<br />\nFreehling said,\"I do not Freehling as unique and exciting<br />\nsubscribe to the image of the as he finds Hopkins to be, and it<br />\nprofessor as all-superior, students makes one hope that perhaps his<br />\nbowing at his feet.\" He described uniqueness will fade as other<br />\nteaching as a profession which,if professors of similar ideas come<br />\nproperly practiced, benefits the to Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\nGrad numbers remain stable<br />\nBy SUSAN WOOLHISER<br />\nDespite cuts in federal aid, the<br />\nnumber of graduate students at<br />\nHopkins has not decreased due to<br />\nthe high quality of graduate<br />\neducation being offered and the<br />\nfinancial position of the graduate<br />\nstudent.<br />\nDean Owen stated the toal<br />\nnumber of graduate students was<br />\napproximately 1100, the same as<br />\nlast year. Many of these graduate<br />\nstudents are receiving 'no<br />\nfinancial aid at all. The majority<br />\n<br />\nOrest Ranum<br />\n<br />\nof those who are receiving<br />\nfinancial aid are receiving only<br />\ntuition and are not getting<br />\nstipends for living expenses.<br />\nDr. Orest Ranum, History<br />\ndepartment chairman called this<br />\nsituation \"a striking change.\" He<br />\nmentioned that the History<br />\ndepartment had nine new<br />\ngraduate students who were not<br />\ngetting any aid. Previously they<br />\nhad had only 3 or 4 students a<br />\nyear who were without aid. The<br />\ncutback in funds for this<br />\ndepartment amounts to a 15-20%<br />\ndecrease , which is the equivalent<br />\nof 3 or 4 full fellowships.<br />\nOwen attributed this situation<br />\nto the federal government's<br />\ncutbacks in graduate aid. \"The<br />\nculprit in this whole thing has<br />\nbeen the federal government.<br />\nThey have been very unreliable,\"<br />\nhe siad. Between 1967 and 1971<br />\nthe government aid was<br />\ndecreased by $900,000. The<br />\nUniversity was forced to make up<br />\nthe loss which resulted in a<br />\ndeficit of $1.8 million, since the<br />\nUniversity was already<br />\ncommitted to matching the<br />\ngovernment funds. The<br />\n<br />\nUniversity's contribution to<br />\ngraduate aid during those years<br />\nwent form $1.4 million to $2.8<br />\nmillion.<br />\nRanum suggested that<br />\ngraduate students paying more of<br />\ntheir own expenses might be \"a<br />\ntrend at distinguished graduate<br />\nschools.\" With more graduate<br />\nschools available, Ranum<br />\nconcluded, the students would be<br />\nmore likely to be willing to pay<br />\nfor a higher level of graduate<br />\neducation. \"The trend will be the<br />\nstudents will have to pay more,\"<br />\nsaid Ranum.<br />\nDr. William Garvey, Chairman<br />\nof the Psychology Department<br />\nagreed with this approach.<br />\n\"There are some students who<br />\nsponsored meals such as Steak would prefer to take out loans<br />\nNight.

Your reporter phoned me<br />\nduring last Friday's budget of crises to<br />\ninquire about the \"new department.\" I<br />\ntold him that I was sorry to spike a story,<br />\nbut there was no new department and as<br />\nfar as I knew none was contemplated.<br />\nRepetition is obviously an occupational<br />\ndisease, so I found myself repeating this<br />\ndisclaimer four times, allowing, I<br />\nthought, for some of the more notorious<br />\ndifficulties of oral transmission around<br />\nhere(and even for my own obliquities of<br />\nstyle).<br />\nAs an unspokesman for a<br />\nnon -department, I suppose our<br />\nconversation should have ended there;<br />\nhowever I did suggest that your reporter<br />\nlook at the current catalogue, that last<br />\nrefuge of Platonic essences, for a general<br />\ndiscussion of new developments in<br />\ncomparative studies for<br />\nundergraduates(he obviously did not,<br />\n<br />\ntki(my,h 1. can in<br />\n<br />\nAnd endemic distsust<br />\n<br />\nmentioned th t lie inigh1 talk with<br />\nGeorge Owen, who chairs a committee<br />\nconsidering the possibilities , of an<br />\n<br />\nundergraduate major in comparative<br />\nliterature(he allowed that he didn't know<br />\nwho Dean Owen was, which apparently<br />\neliminated, him from further<br />\nconsideration).<br />\nThe rest of our conversation was<br />\nconcerned with some reasons, as I saw<br />\nthem, why in the field of literary studies<br />\ncohesion rather than the multiplication<br />\nof departments seemed the best hope for<br />\na resolutely small University that has<br />\nalways prided itself on preserving<br />\nopportunities for dialogue. I tried to<br />\nargue that there was a long tradition at<br />\nHopkins for interdisciplinary<br />\ncooperation, dating back to Gilman's<br />\nseminars and the example of men like<br />\nPeirce and Royce; and that such<br />\nmoments in our intellectual history as the<br />\nLovejoy era programmatically included<br />\ncommunication across disciplinary lines;<br />\nthat surviving institutions such as the<br />\nPhilological Association and the History<br />\nof Ideas Club were reminders of these<br />\nbridges; that more recent members of the<br />\nfaculty such as George Poulet, Leo<br />\nSpitzer, George Boas, and, lately, Jacques<br />\nDerrida had invarious ways affected the<br />\nwork in adjacent departments. Finally, I<br />\nargued that quite a few members of the<br />\npresent literary departments are, in fact,<br />\n\"doii.6\" comparative literature and that,<br />\nthrough their cooperation, there has been<br />\na. small doctoral program in comparative<br />\nliterature for some years now.<br />\nIGiven an obvious(and I'm afraid<br />\nlong-winded)commitment to literary<br />\nstudies that reach across national<br />\nboundaries, I'm sure that I did reflect a<br />\nguarded optimism that appointments<br />\nmay soon be made \u2014under whatever<br />\naegis\u2014which will strengthen comparative<br />\napproaches to literature. (In a small<br />\ninstitution like Hopkins a few steps in<br />\nany direction can have significant<br />\nconsequences.) I also tried to express my<br />\ngratitude to colleagues who have already<br />\ngiven much time and council to the<br />\nproblems of extending and improving<br />\nundergraduate comparative offerings.<br />\nFinally, we talked a bit about a new<br />\nintroductory course, made possible<br />\nthrough the cooperation of some<br />\nfourteen representatives of the literary<br />\ndepartments, dealing with \"fictions\" in<br />\nthe Western literary tradition (to which<br />\nyour article may be a late and bizzare<br />\naddition).<br />\nI realize that all these professorial<br />\nruminations are hardly news, but your \u2022<br />\nsurreal story should, perhaps, have been<br />\nby-lined \"as told to Clifford Irving and<br />\nChief Red Fox.\" Though I did recognize<br />\nthe names of a few colleagues, wrenched<br />\nfrom context, the implausible epithets<br />\nand dadaist juxtapositions suggested that,<br />\n<br />\nthemselves in a tight situation. Beseiged by tenant<br />\ncomplaints in McCoy and Wolman Halls, the<br />\nUniversity was forced to respond to these complaints,<br />\nincluding several violations of the Baltimore City<br />\nHousing Code. These problems were the result of<br />\nUniversity negligence in the maintence of its student<br />\nhousing. In housing students the University took on a<br />\nresponsibility to maintain the buildings provided for<br />\nthat purpose and had been lax in its duties.<br />\nThese difficulties have since been remedied. For this<br />\nthe University should not be applauded, but<br />\nrecognized for having done its duty. Problems such as<br />\nbroken fire escape ladders are not so difficult to<br />\nrecognize and deal with that the UNiversity should<br />\nhave to be pressured by numerous tenant complaints<br />\nand threats of civil intervention into solving them.<br />\nHopkins has taken the first steps toward<br />\nmaintaining a sound housing system with the<br />\nappointment of new Housing Director Peter Heist and<br />\nits recognition of the University's obligations to<br />\ncomply with tenant needs. Hopefully the Housing<br />\nOffice will be able to continue on the path it has set<br />\nfor itself and not fall back into its former negligence.<br />\n<br />\nwe were really talking about pataphysics;<br />\nrather than comparative<br />\nliterature(however loose and baggy that<br />\nmuch abused term).<br />\nI regret any false hopes your article<br />\nmay have raised among those who<br />\nmeasure a University by the number of<br />\nits departments and any unnecessary<br />\nfrissons of outrage which it may have<br />\nprovoked among professional viewers<br />\nwith alarm.<br />\nThe world is, no doubt, too much with<br />\nus just now and the News-Letter may<br />\noffer a relatively harmless escape. I<br />\nsuppose, too, that a reporter's attempt to<br />\nturn a n on -story(faculty hopes for<br />\nimprovement, cherishes togetherness,<br />\noffers a few new courses)may demand<br />\nsome editorial invention. Still, by your<br />\nsurreal coverage inevitably reminds me of<br />\nthat desperate attempt by a Crimson<br />\nlegman to make a story out of A.<br />\nLawrence Lowell's ponderous opposition<br />\nto an architecturally undistinguished<br />\nBoston Transit kiosk within sight of his<br />\ndomain: \"President Lowell fights<br />\nerection in Harvard Yard.\"<br />\n<br />\nBY JOE CANTOR<br />\nGeorge McGovern came to Baltimore<br />\nFriday, and any gains he made here<br />\nhappened in spite of my efforts and not<br />\nbecause of them.

I consoled<br />\nmyself in the expectation that the more<br />\nprestigious jobs would follow. What I<br />\ndidn't realize at the time was that in<br />\nputting the beer and soda on ice, I was<br />\nfulfilling my major assignment of the<br />\nday.<br />\n' My job on Press Bus D was to keep the<br />\npress happy.

Like any Olympic<br />\nGames, these had their moments<br />\nof brilliance --the amazing feats<br />\nof swimmer Mark Spitz, the<br />\ninfectious grace and beauty of<br />\ngymnast Olga Korbut, Shane<br />\n<br />\nGould and her toy kangeroo--but<br />\nthese were far overshadowed by<br />\nthe pettiness, chauvinism and<br />\nchicanery which prevailed almost<br />\nfrom the outset--culminating in<br />\nthe still incomprehensible<br />\nU.S.-Russia basketball \"game\".<br />\nThe unfortunate moments of<br />\ntilt Twentieth Olympiad are too<br />\nnumerous and unpleasant to<br />\nmention, however, the following<br />\nincident, which went virtually<br />\nunnoticed, bears repeating as a<br />\nsorrowful reminder of what the<br />\nOlympics have become: Jim<br />\nMcKay's frenzied explanation<br />\nthat the raised fingers of the<br />\nvictorious U.S. 400-meter relay<br />\nteam signified, \"We're Number<br />\nOne!\" and were not intended as a<br />\npolitical gesture of any kind.<br />\nSuch assurances were sadly<br />\nnecessary.<br />\nIn the near future, Congress<br />\nwill be asked to appropriate<br />\n$15.5 million for the Winter<br />\n<br />\nOlympics in Denver. Whether or<br />\nnot they will is uncertain, but<br />\nwhat is certain is that the Games<br />\nmust either be diminished in<br />\nimportance and put into<br />\nperspective, or simplY<br />\ndiscontinued.<br />\nThe administrators and<br />\norganizers of the Olympics have<br />\nlost touch with athletes, athletics<br />\nand the realities of the world. If<br />\nthey are to be continued, let the<br />\nGames be seen for what they<br />\nreally are: a sporting event, a<br />\npageant of friendly international<br />\nathletic competition, and not a<br />\nforum and showcase for<br />\nmurderers, protesters, and<br />\npatriots.<br />\nWith a feeling of great relief,<br />\nthe Olympic Games have ended<br />\nwith a vow to reconvene in 1976.<br />\nFor many--the memory of<br />\nMunich still fresh in their<br />\nminds--the only solace is that<br />\nMontreal is still four years away.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "Research projects are<br />\nhurt by overhead costs<br />\nBy RUSS VANE<br />\n\"Overhead costs of research<br />\nare hampering the ability of some<br />\nprofessors to obtain extended or<br />\nnew research grants and<br />\ncontracts,\" said Dr. Robert E.<br />\nGreen, chairman of Dept. of<br />\nMechanics and Materials Science.<br />\nHe remarked after a<br />\nDepartment Chairmen's meeting<br />\nlast Friday,\"It's difficult to fund<br />\nprograms much less add more<br />\nmoney to the proposals.

Overhead is the<br />\npercentage added to contracts<br />\nand grants to cover these Indirect<br />\nCosts that are incurred by these<br />\nprograms. If overhead was 50 per<br />\ncent and a professor was to be<br />\npaid $10,000 for his salary, then<br />\nhe would have to ask for $15,000<br />\nin his proposal.

He<br />\nalso commented that because the<br />\nundergraduate students have<br />\nbeen somewhat \"neglected\" at<br />\nHopkins, efforts on the part of<br />\nprofessors seriously interested in<br />\nteaching would be better<br />\nappreciated by students here<br />\nthan at other institutions. Dr:<br />\nFreehling added that the<br />\nadministrative workload that<br />\nplagues professors at larger<br />\nuniversities is not present at<br />\nHopkins. He explained that its<br />\nabsence allows the professor<br />\nmore time to improve his<br />\nteaching abilities by interacting<br />\nwith his students on a more<br />\npersonal basis.<br />\n\"I was hired to teach,\" Dr.<br /><br />\nMcCoy and Wolman<br />\ncode violations fixed<br />\nHousing code violations cited<br />\nin April 1972 for Wolman and<br />\nMcCoy Halls have been<br />\neliminated, according to Herb<br />\nFrederick, Superintendant of<br />\nHousing.<br />\nHe stated that extensive work<br />\non the fire door system in<br />\nWolman has been completed, and<br />\nthat, to his knowledge, no<br />\nfurther violations of City<br />\nHousing Codes remain.<br />\nHowever, an ongoing<br />\nmaintenance problem still<br />\nremains in both Wolman and<br />\nMcCoy he said. Frederick said<br />\nthat this problem results from<br />\nstudent life styles and the fact<br />\nthat student housing is run on a<br />\nFire door in Wolman Hall<br />\nno-profit basis.

The<br />\nwork is to be published late this<br />\nyear by Harper and Row.<br />\nThough his particular interest<br />\nlies in the Middle Period of<br />\nAmerican History, Dr. Freehling<br />\nexpressed eagerness for teaching<br />\nin areas other than his own. He<br />\nexplained that by branching out,<br />\na professor can rid himself of the<br />\nredundancy and tedium which<br />\nprevents a fresh approach to both<br />\nstudents and subject matter.<br />\n\"You learn from the students,\"<br />\nhe said. \"They see things that<br /><br />\nWilliam Freehling: \"I was hired to teach.\"<br />\nteacher as much as the student.<br />\nperhaps you have not.\"<br />\nSuch freshness of approach<br />\nIn summarizing his views on<br />\nundergraduate teaching, Dr. will undoubtedly make Dr.<br />\nFreehling said,\"I do not Freehling as unique and exciting<br />\nsubscribe to the image of the as he finds Hopkins to be, and it<br />\nprofessor as all-superior, students makes one hope that perhaps his<br />\nbowing at his feet.\" He described uniqueness will fade as other<br />\nteaching as a profession which,if professors of similar ideas come<br />\nproperly practiced, benefits the to Hopkins.<br /><br />\nGrad numbers remain stable<br />\nBy SUSAN WOOLHISER<br />\nDespite cuts in federal aid, the<br />\nnumber of graduate students at<br />\nHopkins has not decreased due to<br />\nthe high quality of graduate<br />\neducation being offered and the<br />\nfinancial position of the graduate<br />\nstudent.<br />\nDean Owen stated the toal<br />\nnumber of graduate students was<br />\napproximately 1100, the same as<br />\nlast year. Many of these graduate<br />\nstudents are receiving 'no<br />\nfinancial aid at all. The majority<br /><br />\nOrest Ranum<br /><br />\nof those who are receiving<br />\nfinancial aid are receiving only<br />\ntuition and are not getting<br />\nstipends for living expenses.<br />\nDr. Orest Ranum, History<br />\ndepartment chairman called this<br />\nsituation \"a striking change.\" He<br />\nmentioned that the History<br />\ndepartment had nine new<br />\ngraduate students who were not<br />\ngetting any aid. Previously they<br />\nhad had only 3 or 4 students a<br />\nyear who were without aid. The<br />\ncutback in funds for this<br />\ndepartment amounts to a 15-20%<br />\ndecrease , which is the equivalent<br />\nof 3 or 4 full fellowships.<br />\nOwen attributed this situation<br />\nto the federal government's<br />\ncutbacks in graduate aid. \"The<br />\nculprit in this whole thing has<br />\nbeen the federal government.<br />\nThey have been very unreliable,\"<br />\nhe siad. Between 1967 and 1971<br />\nthe government aid was<br />\ndecreased by $900,000. The<br />\nUniversity was forced to make up<br />\nthe loss which resulted in a<br />\ndeficit of $1.8 million, since the<br />\nUniversity was already<br />\ncommitted to matching the<br />\ngovernment funds. The<br /><br />\nUniversity's contribution to<br />\ngraduate aid during those years<br />\nwent form $1.4 million to $2.8<br />\nmillion.<br />\nRanum suggested that<br />\ngraduate students paying more of<br />\ntheir own expenses might be \"a<br />\ntrend at distinguished graduate<br />\nschools.\" With more graduate<br />\nschools available, Ranum<br />\nconcluded, the students would be<br />\nmore likely to be willing to pay<br />\nfor a higher level of graduate<br />\neducation. \"The trend will be the<br />\nstudents will have to pay more,\"<br />\nsaid Ranum.<br />\nDr. William Garvey, Chairman<br />\nof the Psychology Department<br />\nagreed with this approach.<br />\n\"There are some students who<br />\nsponsored meals such as Steak would prefer to take out loans<br />\nNight.

Your reporter phoned me<br />\nduring last Friday's budget of crises to<br />\ninquire about the \"new department.\" I<br />\ntold him that I was sorry to spike a story,<br />\nbut there was no new department and as<br />\nfar as I knew none was contemplated.<br />\nRepetition is obviously an occupational<br />\ndisease, so I found myself repeating this<br />\ndisclaimer four times, allowing, I<br />\nthought, for some of the more notorious<br />\ndifficulties of oral transmission around<br />\nhere(and even for my own obliquities of<br />\nstyle).<br />\nAs an unspokesman for a<br />\nnon -department, I suppose our<br />\nconversation should have ended there;<br />\nhowever I did suggest that your reporter<br />\nlook at the current catalogue, that last<br />\nrefuge of Platonic essences, for a general<br />\ndiscussion of new developments in<br />\ncomparative studies for<br />\nundergraduates(he obviously did not,<br /><br />\ntki(my,h 1. can in<br /><br />\nAnd endemic distsust<br /><br />\nmentioned th t lie inigh1 talk with<br />\nGeorge Owen, who chairs a committee<br />\nconsidering the possibilities , of an<br /><br />\nundergraduate major in comparative<br />\nliterature(he allowed that he didn't know<br />\nwho Dean Owen was, which apparently<br />\neliminated, him from further<br />\nconsideration).<br />\nThe rest of our conversation was<br />\nconcerned with some reasons, as I saw<br />\nthem, why in the field of literary studies<br />\ncohesion rather than the multiplication<br />\nof departments seemed the best hope for<br />\na resolutely small University that has<br />\nalways prided itself on preserving<br />\nopportunities for dialogue. I tried to<br />\nargue that there was a long tradition at<br />\nHopkins for interdisciplinary<br />\ncooperation, dating back to Gilman's<br />\nseminars and the example of men like<br />\nPeirce and Royce; and that such<br />\nmoments in our intellectual history as the<br />\nLovejoy era programmatically included<br />\ncommunication across disciplinary lines;<br />\nthat surviving institutions such as the<br />\nPhilological Association and the History<br />\nof Ideas Club were reminders of these<br />\nbridges; that more recent members of the<br />\nfaculty such as George Poulet, Leo<br />\nSpitzer, George Boas, and, lately, Jacques<br />\nDerrida had invarious ways affected the<br />\nwork in adjacent departments. Finally, I<br />\nargued that quite a few members of the<br />\npresent literary departments are, in fact,<br />\n\"doii.6\" comparative literature and that,<br />\nthrough their cooperation, there has been<br />\na. small doctoral program in comparative<br />\nliterature for some years now.<br />\nIGiven an obvious(and I'm afraid<br />\nlong-winded)commitment to literary<br />\nstudies that reach across national<br />\nboundaries, I'm sure that I did reflect a<br />\nguarded optimism that appointments<br />\nmay soon be made \u2014under whatever<br />\naegis\u2014which will strengthen comparative<br />\napproaches to literature. (In a small<br />\ninstitution like Hopkins a few steps in<br />\nany direction can have significant<br />\nconsequences.) I also tried to express my<br />\ngratitude to colleagues who have already<br />\ngiven much time and council to the<br />\nproblems of extending and improving<br />\nundergraduate comparative offerings.<br />\nFinally, we talked a bit about a new<br />\nintroductory course, made possible<br />\nthrough the cooperation of some<br />\nfourteen representatives of the literary<br />\ndepartments, dealing with \"fictions\" in<br />\nthe Western literary tradition (to which<br />\nyour article may be a late and bizzare<br />\naddition).<br />\nI realize that all these professorial<br />\nruminations are hardly news, but your \u2022<br />\nsurreal story should, perhaps, have been<br />\nby-lined \"as told to Clifford Irving and<br />\nChief Red Fox.\" Though I did recognize<br />\nthe names of a few colleagues, wrenched<br />\nfrom context, the implausible epithets<br />\nand dadaist juxtapositions suggested that,<br /><br />\nthemselves in a tight situation. Beseiged by tenant<br />\ncomplaints in McCoy and Wolman Halls, the<br />\nUniversity was forced to respond to these complaints,<br />\nincluding several violations of the Baltimore City<br />\nHousing Code. These problems were the result of<br />\nUniversity negligence in the maintence of its student<br />\nhousing. In housing students the University took on a<br />\nresponsibility to maintain the buildings provided for<br />\nthat purpose and had been lax in its duties.<br />\nThese difficulties have since been remedied. For this<br />\nthe University should not be applauded, but<br />\nrecognized for having done its duty. Problems such as<br />\nbroken fire escape ladders are not so difficult to<br />\nrecognize and deal with that the UNiversity should<br />\nhave to be pressured by numerous tenant complaints<br />\nand threats of civil intervention into solving them.<br />\nHopkins has taken the first steps toward<br />\nmaintaining a sound housing system with the<br />\nappointment of new Housing Director Peter Heist and<br />\nits recognition of the University's obligations to<br />\ncomply with tenant needs. Hopefully the Housing<br />\nOffice will be able to continue on the path it has set<br />\nfor itself and not fall back into its former negligence.<br /><br />\nwe were really talking about pataphysics;<br />\nrather than comparative<br />\nliterature(however loose and baggy that<br />\nmuch abused term).<br />\nI regret any false hopes your article<br />\nmay have raised among those who<br />\nmeasure a University by the number of<br />\nits departments and any unnecessary<br />\nfrissons of outrage which it may have<br />\nprovoked among professional viewers<br />\nwith alarm.<br />\nThe world is, no doubt, too much with<br />\nus just now and the News-Letter may<br />\noffer a relatively harmless escape. I<br />\nsuppose, too, that a reporter's attempt to<br />\nturn a n on -story(faculty hopes for<br />\nimprovement, cherishes togetherness,<br />\noffers a few new courses)may demand<br />\nsome editorial invention. Still, by your<br />\nsurreal coverage inevitably reminds me of<br />\nthat desperate attempt by a Crimson<br />\nlegman to make a story out of A.<br />\nLawrence Lowell's ponderous opposition<br />\nto an architecturally undistinguished<br />\nBoston Transit kiosk within sight of his<br />\ndomain: \"President Lowell fights<br />\nerection in Harvard Yard.\"<br /><br />\nBY JOE CANTOR<br />\nGeorge McGovern came to Baltimore<br />\nFriday, and any gains he made here<br />\nhappened in spite of my efforts and not<br />\nbecause of them.

I consoled<br />\nmyself in the expectation that the more<br />\nprestigious jobs would follow. What I<br />\ndidn't realize at the time was that in<br />\nputting the beer and soda on ice, I was<br />\nfulfilling my major assignment of the<br />\nday.<br />\n' My job on Press Bus D was to keep the<br />\npress happy.

Whether or<br />\nnot they will is uncertain, but<br />\nwhat is certain is that the Games<br />\nmust either be diminished in<br />\nimportance and put into<br />\nperspective, or simplY<br />\ndiscontinued.<br />\nThe administrators and<br />\norganizers of the Olympics have<br />\nlost touch with athletes, athletics<br />\nand the realities of the world. If<br />\nthey are to be continued, let the<br />\nGames be seen for what they<br />\nreally are: a sporting event, a<br />\npageant of friendly international<br />\nathletic competition, and not a<br />\nforum and showcase for<br />\nmurderers, protesters, and<br />\npatriots.<br />\nWith a feeling of great relief,<br />\nthe Olympic Games have ended<br />\nwith a vow to reconvene in 1976.<br />\nFor many--the memory of<br />\nMunich still fresh in their<br />\nminds--the only solace is that<br />\nMontreal is still four years away.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 40678, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "03384dc3-4e1a-47bd-b752-65a88c15d96d", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/14130-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 14130, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "993d38d6-f5bd-45e8-ac58-f13c86fdf7ea", "url": "/node/14130"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "9f5765dc-307e-470c-86da-ed30fba7b181"}]}
