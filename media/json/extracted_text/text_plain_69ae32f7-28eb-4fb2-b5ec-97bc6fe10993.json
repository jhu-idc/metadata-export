After much deliberation<br />\nthe much esteemed leaders decided to ban the trouble makers<br />\nfrom all government meetings,<br />\nfiguring that if these people<br />\nknew nothing they certainly<br />\ncouldn't ask any embarrassing<br />\nquestions. Needless to say this<br />\nwas a violation of the very principle upon which the government<br />\nof Goody-Goody Land rested.<br />\nBut the leaders felt that the<br />\nseriousness of the situation more<br />\nthan justified this minor suspension of civil liberties.<br />\nMeasure Did Not Work<br />\nHowever, much to the leaders<br />\nsurprise, this measure did not<br />\nwork. On the contrary, the attacks on the government were<br />\nredoubled. These traitors to the<br />\nIdeal blissful ignorance not only<br />\nredoubled their attacks but also<br />\nhad the gall to criticize their<br />\ngovernments' suspension of civil<br />\nliberties which they refused to<br />\nrealize had only been for the<br />\npublic's welfare.<br />\nAt this point the leaders decided that the time had come for<br />\nplaying games to stop. While<br />\nthey were busy readying their<br />\nfinal crushing blow which would<br />\nbe certain to stifle all criticism,<br />\nthey staved off their ever-growing opposition by resorting to just<br />\nthose tactics which they had<br />\ndeplored in the group of traitors.<br />\nThey resorted to criticism. Being<br />\nnew at this game they were<br />\nforced to make up what they<br />\nlacked in quality by verbosity and<br />\nvitriol. But it must be admitted<br />\nthat they did try hard.<br />\n<br />\nFinal Plans<br />\nMeanwhile, the leaders prepared their final plans. The debate over methods to be used<br />\nwas \u2022 hot and furious. Some of<br />\nthe leaders stated that they did<br />\nnot feel that it was morally right<br />\nto take any action. But their protests were quickly silenced by the<br />\nmajority and the plans went<br />\nforward.<br />\nAt this point our story must<br />\nstop. For the Land of GoodyGoody was no longer GoodyGoody. Enough people had realized that utopia had not yet<br />\nbeen reached. The moral to this<br />\nstory is, of course, don't ask questions and don't think. Just remember the words of the famous<br />\neducator J. Stalin: \"to the peasant ignorance is more than bliss,<br />\nit is\u2022safety (to the government).\"<br />\nCharles Nathan<br />\n<br />\nDefamation\u2014I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt has recently been brought<br />\nto the attention of the Student<br />\nantivarious<br />\nCouncil \u2022 that<br />\nreligious and anti-negro symbols<br />\nand posters have been seen<br />\naround the campus.

Now,I realize<br />\nthat, perhaps, a large percentage<br />\nof Hopkins men attending the<br />\ndance will be dating girls other<br />\nthan those from Goucher; but<br />\nas usual in Hopkins events, a<br />\nmajor amount of prospective<br />\ndates will be from Goucher. I<br />\nshall not even mention the fact<br />\nthat it is a slap in the face to<br />\nthe new Hopkins-Goucher Coordination Committee; but lets<br />\nnot be hypocritical and call for<br />\nclose cooperation intellectually<br />\nand socially, unless we mean<br />\nwhat we say.<br />\n<br />\nsocial life at Hopkins will certainly fall over if slip-shod planning like this continues.

After much deliberation<br />\nthe much esteemed leaders decided to ban the trouble makers<br />\nfrom all government meetings,<br />\nfiguring that if these people<br />\nknew nothing they certainly<br />\ncouldn't ask any embarrassing<br />\nquestions. Needless to say this<br />\nwas a violation of the very principle upon which the government<br />\nof Goody-Goody Land rested.<br />\nBut the leaders felt that the<br />\nseriousness of the situation more<br />\nthan justified this minor suspension of civil liberties.<br />\nMeasure Did Not Work<br />\nHowever, much to the leaders<br />\nsurprise, this measure did not<br />\nwork. On the contrary, the attacks on the government were<br />\nredoubled. These traitors to the<br />\nIdeal blissful ignorance not only<br />\nredoubled their attacks but also<br />\nhad the gall to criticize their<br />\ngovernments' suspension of civil<br />\nliberties which they refused to<br />\nrealize had only been for the<br />\npublic's welfare.<br />\nAt this point the leaders decided that the time had come for<br />\nplaying games to stop. While<br />\nthey were busy readying their<br />\nfinal crushing blow which would<br />\nbe certain to stifle all criticism,<br />\nthey staved off their ever-growing opposition by resorting to just<br />\nthose tactics which they had<br />\ndeplored in the group of traitors.<br />\nThey resorted to criticism. Being<br />\nnew at this game they were<br />\nforced to make up what they<br />\nlacked in quality by verbosity and<br />\nvitriol. But it must be admitted<br />\nthat they did try hard.<br /><br />\nFinal Plans<br />\nMeanwhile, the leaders prepared their final plans. The debate over methods to be used<br />\nwas \u2022 hot and furious. Some of<br />\nthe leaders stated that they did<br />\nnot feel that it was morally right<br />\nto take any action. But their protests were quickly silenced by the<br />\nmajority and the plans went<br />\nforward.<br />\nAt this point our story must<br />\nstop. For the Land of GoodyGoody was no longer GoodyGoody. Enough people had realized that utopia had not yet<br />\nbeen reached. The moral to this<br />\nstory is, of course, don't ask questions and don't think. Just remember the words of the famous<br />\neducator J. Stalin: \"to the peasant ignorance is more than bliss,<br />\nit is\u2022safety (to the government).\"<br />\nCharles Nathan<br /><br />\nDefamation\u2014I<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nIt has recently been brought<br />\nto the attention of the Student<br />\nantivarious<br />\nCouncil \u2022 that<br />\nreligious and anti-negro symbols<br />\nand posters have been seen<br />\naround the campus.
