President's House.<br />\nHOMEWOOD AS IT IS NOW<br />\nTo Most of the members of the<br />\nUniversity, Homewood stands for a<br />\ndream of the future, something to be<br />\nhoped for NV ith but little thought of<br />\nseeing the accomplishment of the<br />\nhope. It is, perhaps, little realized<br />\nthat actual substantial progress toword the location of the University<br />\nat its new site is constantly being<br />\nmade,and that much has already been<br />\ndone in this direction. It is the purpose of this article to give some idea<br />\nOf the results already achieved, and<br />\nto indicate briefly the plans for the<br />\nimmediate future.<br />\nThe plan which is printed on this<br />\npage is intended to give some idea of<br />\nthe general arrangement of the<br />\nbuildings and grounds of the future<br />\nUniversity ;but there have been many<br />\nminor changes made in the plans<br />\nsince the cut was made, and it hardly gives an adequate idea of the<br />\npresent intentions of the designers.<br />\nThis is especially true of the landscape effects, grading, terracing, and<br />\ngeneral laying out of the grounds.<br />\nThere have been fewer changes in<br />\nthe placing and design of the<br />\nbuildings; the dormitory quadrangle,<br />\nhowever, has been rearranged, and<br />\nthe buildings about the approach to<br />\nthe central court have been somewhat<br />\ndifferently placed. This has brought<br />\nthe Carroll mansion into a more<br />\nProminent position, where its importance will be recognized, and has<br />\nmade room for a new McCoy Hall<br />\nnn.Charles street just south of the<br />\nmain entrance.<br />\nWhen the Homewood property was<br />\naentlirel. the first step taken by the<br />\nUniversity authorities was to secure<br />\na general plan for the laying out of<br />\nthe grounds and buildings. Architects were invited to submit plans in<br />\ncompetition, and those of Messrs.<br />\n<br />\nN. Laboratories. 0. Scientific Mu-<br />\n<br />\nParker and Thomas were accepted.<br />\nThese plans have since been elaborated and somwhat modified. Some<br />\nextremely difficult problems in landscape architecture presented themselves and have given employment<br />\nto the hest talent in the whole field<br />\nof architecture. The suburban character of the grounds with the large<br />\nbody of woods on the south suggests<br />\na sylvan treatment, while the necessary dignity and size of the academic<br />\nbuildings demands something more<br />\nformal. Again, the arrangement of<br />\nthe buildings along an axis that meets<br />\nCharles street at an acute angle forbids a single main entrance along<br />\nthis axis. This difficulty has been<br />\nmet by a system of circular entrances<br />\nwith a hollow bowl between; and<br />\nthis plan also solves the practical<br />\nproblems of securing an attractive<br />\ngrade from the street to the Administration Quadrangle, and of restoring the picturesque situation of the<br />\nCarroll mansion, which has been destroyed by the grading of Charles<br />\nstreet at a lower level. The bowl<br />\neffect draws the eye directly to the<br />\ninner entrance to the University<br />\ngrounds at the gateway and arcade<br />\nconnecting the buildings. It is recognized, however, that even the present plans may be improved, for certain difficulties, both practical and<br />\nartistic, still remain. These, it is<br />\nhoped, will be finally overcome in<br />\nthe revision of the plans now in progress, involving the location of the<br />\nmonument to Johns Hopkins as the<br />\ncentral theme of the entrance.<br />\nWith the grading of the entrance<br />\nbowl is associated that of the Administration Quadrangle, which, with<br />\nits stately buildings, will rise as the<br />\ndominating feature above the Laborat,i-v tl1o4lrangle to the south and<br />\nthe Botanical Gardens to the west.<br />\nAt the same time, the terraces will<br />\n<br />\nfurnish a delightful promenade, with<br />\nattractive vistas across the grounds<br />\nto the distant city in the background.<br />\nGreat care has been devoted to<br />\nsaving intact the present splendid<br />\nforest on the campus. Experts early<br />\nmade a careful examination of all<br />\nthe woodland area to determine the<br />\nage. lieplth, and prospective life of<br />\nthe great trees. This has shown tha:<br />\nmany of the finest ones are unhealth<br />\nand if careful culling is not resorted<br />\nto the entire forest stand will be in<br />\nP. state of decay in fifteen or twenty<br />\nyears. To overcome this condition,<br />\nmany unneal'hy aged trees have been<br />\nremoved to admit sunlight to the<br />\nvoting and vigorous smaller ones.<br />\nwhich are the hope of the future<br />\nwoodland.<br />\nOf actual building at Homewood<br />\nqiere has, of course, been little; but<br />\nit is only fair to mention the beginnings already made. In connection with the botanical garden there<br />\nhas been erected the first permanent<br />\nbuilding, a greenhouse and laboratory<br />\nfor botanical research. This is located at the west end of the cross<br />\naxis and not far from the future<br />\nchapel. of more interest to the tinderpradnate is the beautiful new athletic field at the extreme north.

President's House.<br />\nHOMEWOOD AS IT IS NOW<br />\nTo Most of the members of the<br />\nUniversity, Homewood stands for a<br />\ndream of the future, something to be<br />\nhoped for NV ith but little thought of<br />\nseeing the accomplishment of the<br />\nhope. It is, perhaps, little realized<br />\nthat actual substantial progress toword the location of the University<br />\nat its new site is constantly being<br />\nmade,and that much has already been<br />\ndone in this direction. It is the purpose of this article to give some idea<br />\nOf the results already achieved, and<br />\nto indicate briefly the plans for the<br />\nimmediate future.<br />\nThe plan which is printed on this<br />\npage is intended to give some idea of<br />\nthe general arrangement of the<br />\nbuildings and grounds of the future<br />\nUniversity ;but there have been many<br />\nminor changes made in the plans<br />\nsince the cut was made, and it hardly gives an adequate idea of the<br />\npresent intentions of the designers.<br />\nThis is especially true of the landscape effects, grading, terracing, and<br />\ngeneral laying out of the grounds.<br />\nThere have been fewer changes in<br />\nthe placing and design of the<br />\nbuildings; the dormitory quadrangle,<br />\nhowever, has been rearranged, and<br />\nthe buildings about the approach to<br />\nthe central court have been somewhat<br />\ndifferently placed. This has brought<br />\nthe Carroll mansion into a more<br />\nProminent position, where its importance will be recognized, and has<br />\nmade room for a new McCoy Hall<br />\nnn.Charles street just south of the<br />\nmain entrance.<br />\nWhen the Homewood property was<br />\naentlirel. the first step taken by the<br />\nUniversity authorities was to secure<br />\na general plan for the laying out of<br />\nthe grounds and buildings. Architects were invited to submit plans in<br />\ncompetition, and those of Messrs.<br /><br />\nN. Laboratories. 0. Scientific Mu-<br /><br />\nParker and Thomas were accepted.<br />\nThese plans have since been elaborated and somwhat modified. Some<br />\nextremely difficult problems in landscape architecture presented themselves and have given employment<br />\nto the hest talent in the whole field<br />\nof architecture. The suburban character of the grounds with the large<br />\nbody of woods on the south suggests<br />\na sylvan treatment, while the necessary dignity and size of the academic<br />\nbuildings demands something more<br />\nformal. Again, the arrangement of<br />\nthe buildings along an axis that meets<br />\nCharles street at an acute angle forbids a single main entrance along<br />\nthis axis. This difficulty has been<br />\nmet by a system of circular entrances<br />\nwith a hollow bowl between; and<br />\nthis plan also solves the practical<br />\nproblems of securing an attractive<br />\ngrade from the street to the Administration Quadrangle, and of restoring the picturesque situation of the<br />\nCarroll mansion, which has been destroyed by the grading of Charles<br />\nstreet at a lower level. The bowl<br />\neffect draws the eye directly to the<br />\ninner entrance to the University<br />\ngrounds at the gateway and arcade<br />\nconnecting the buildings. It is recognized, however, that even the present plans may be improved, for certain difficulties, both practical and<br />\nartistic, still remain. These, it is<br />\nhoped, will be finally overcome in<br />\nthe revision of the plans now in progress, involving the location of the<br />\nmonument to Johns Hopkins as the<br />\ncentral theme of the entrance.<br />\nWith the grading of the entrance<br />\nbowl is associated that of the Administration Quadrangle, which, with<br />\nits stately buildings, will rise as the<br />\ndominating feature above the Laborat,i-v tl1o4lrangle to the south and<br />\nthe Botanical Gardens to the west.<br />\nAt the same time, the terraces will<br /><br />\nfurnish a delightful promenade, with<br />\nattractive vistas across the grounds<br />\nto the distant city in the background.<br />\nGreat care has been devoted to<br />\nsaving intact the present splendid<br />\nforest on the campus. Experts early<br />\nmade a careful examination of all<br />\nthe woodland area to determine the<br />\nage. lieplth, and prospective life of<br />\nthe great trees. This has shown tha:<br />\nmany of the finest ones are unhealth<br />\nand if careful culling is not resorted<br />\nto the entire forest stand will be in<br />\nP. state of decay in fifteen or twenty<br />\nyears. To overcome this condition,<br />\nmany unneal'hy aged trees have been<br />\nremoved to admit sunlight to the<br />\nvoting and vigorous smaller ones.<br />\nwhich are the hope of the future<br />\nwoodland.<br />\nOf actual building at Homewood<br />\nqiere has, of course, been little; but<br />\nit is only fair to mention the beginnings already made.
