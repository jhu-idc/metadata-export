His<br />\ndiscussion focused on the<br />\ntheories explained in his book<br />\nLovemaps. \"Lovemap\" is a<br />\nterm coined by Money, which<br />\nhe defines as \"a developmental<br />\nscheme or template in the<br />\nmind/brain of the idealized<br />\nlover and projected sexuoerotic<br />\nactivity.\" He emphasized that<br />\nan individual's lovemap is as<br />\nunique as his fingerprints.<br />\nA lovemap undergoes both<br />\nprenatal and postnatal formation and is affected by nature<br />\nand nurturing. Although a<br />\nlovemap is not completed in the<br />\n<br />\nbrain at birth, predilection for<br />\nmasculinity or femininity exists.<br />\nThe combined influences of the<br />\nskin senses, eyes, ears, and to<br />\na lesser extent smell and taste,<br />\nfinish the development.<br />\nMoney explained that males<br />\nare more dependent on visual<br />\nimagery for lovemap formation, while females are more incluenced by skin senses.<br />\nAccording to Money, an individual's lovemap develops<br />\nalmost fully by age eight. \"The<br />\ndevelopment occurs under the<br />\nauspices of the same people<br />\nwho give you your native<br />\nlanguage,\" he stated.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, we vandalize the normal lovemap<br />\ndevelopment of children by<br />\nconveying the idea that sex is<br />\nnasty and dirty,\" Money<br />\ndeclared. He believes that by<br />\nnot allowing children to grow<br />\nup with intact lovemaps, we are<br />\ncreating the sexual problems<br />\nthat plague our society.<br />\n\"Kids<br />\nwill<br />\nprepare<br />\nthemselves for normalcy of<br />\ndevelopment through sexualrehearsal play, if it is not driven<br />\nout of them by society,\"<br />\nMoney explained. He noted<br />\n<br />\nthat if monkeys are raised in<br />\nisolation and deprived of sexual<br />\nrehearsal-play, they will never<br />\nreproduce when placed with<br />\nother members of their species.<br />\nBecause of the lack of clinics<br />\nfor sexual development and<br />\nsexual problems of children,<br />\nparents have nowhere to turn if<br />\nthings begin to go wrong.<br />\nMoney criticized this fact as a<br />\nresult of our \"sex-negative<br />\nculture.\"<br />\n\"We are obsessed v\u2018ith<br />\ncriminalizing sex, punishing sex<br />\noffenders rather than finding<br />\nout what causes the problems,\"<br />\nhe stated. He believes the important issue is to discover why<br />\npeople grow up with paraphilic<br />\nlovemaps. Paraphilia is defined<br />\nas a lovemap with distortions or<br />\nperversions.<br />\nMoney discussed the mistaken notion about the connection between paraphilia and<br />\npornography. \"Paraphilia is<br />\nnot contagious, and pornography does not create<br />\nparaphilia,\" he explained.<br />\n\"The public is afraid that if you<br />\nallow people to see pornography, they will 'catch'<br />\nparaphilia.

The<br />\nSoviet government also pays<br />\nfor the few philosophy journals, such as Issues of<br />\nPhilosophy, in which the<br />\nwriters are government<br />\nemployees. In addition to funding, \"the tasks are chosen by<br />\nthe government,\" said Schneewind; the government tells the<br />\nwriters what issues to cover.<br />\nSchneewind noticed in his<br />\ntalks with the Soviets that they<br />\nwere, \"very touchy about our<br />\n[American] allegations that<br />\nthey are not free to speak<br />\nopinions.\"<br />\nAn example of this was a<br />\ndiscussion on tenure. \"We asked<br />\nthem about tenure,\" said<br />\nSchneewind,\" and told them<br />\nthat in our system we can't get<br />\nfired for saying what we think.\"<br />\nThe Americans asked the Soviets<br />\nif they could get fired for verbalizing opinions dissenting the<br />\ngovernment. \"Nobody here has<br />\ndissenting opinions,\" was the<br />\nSoviet reply.<br />\n<br />\nSoviet philosophy combines<br />\nwith elements of psychology and<br />\nsociology to be immediate and<br />\ninvolved with daily life. \"They<br />\ncriticize western philosophy as irrelevent and abstract,\" Schneewind observed.

C 1986 Continental Air Lines, Inc.<br />\n<br />\n\f8/OCTOBER 10, 1986<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter Japanese Artwork<br />\nThe Highlight of the Calendar Results in a Furor<br />\nEarlier this year, we discussed the recent decline of Intersession and urged<br />\nstudents and faculty alike to begin planning for that informal period of noncompetitive study early. Now that a few<br />\nweeks have passed, it's time to consider<br />\na number of specific improvements that<br />\nmight make Intersession '87 the best yet.<br />\nAlready, plans have been made to offer eleven new \"intensive\" courses in<br />\nforeign languages and computers. Those<br />\nplans are certainly a step in the right<br />\ndirection. But Intersession needs a nearly<br />\ncomplete overhaul, not just fine tuning<br />\nin language and computer course offerings. So, we advance the following<br />\nrecommendations.<br />\nFirst, the administration needs to dust<br />\noff the Intersession Proposal written by<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies in November, 1984, study it, and<br />\nimplement the courses of action proposed therein.<br />\nTo date, exactly one of the numerous<br />\nand well-founded recommendations in<br />\nthe C.U.S. report has been put into effect (namely the addition of special skills<br />\nclasses in languages and computers<br />\ndiscussed above). The rest of the ideas<br />\nhave apparently faded away into oblivion. There's still time, however, to blow<br />\nlife into some of the C.U.S. recommendations, and the University ought to do<br />\nso.<br />\nTo improve the academic nature of Intersession, the C.U.S. report proposes,<br />\namong other things, an emphasis on<br />\ncourse offerings in fields that have traditionally been weak at Hopkins. An array of Intersession offerings in areas like<br />\ntheater, journalism and business would<br />\ncertainly be an easy way to minimize<br />\nHopkins' shortcomings in these<br />\ndisciplines and expand the scope of the<br />\nIntersession program. Attracting professionals in such fields to teach at Intersession should be a relatively easy endeavor<br />\nconsidering the prominence of many<br />\nHopkins alumni in these diverse areas.<br />\nThe C.U.S. report also wisely suggests<br />\nthe expansion of current departmental<br />\nofferings to improve the academic nature<br />\nof Intersession. Specifically, the report<br />\nurges professors to offer survey courses<br />\nor seminars in their particular fields of<br />\n<br />\nresearch\u2014fields which may be too new<br />\nor \"experimental\" to be taught in the<br />\nnormal undergraduate curriculum. Such<br />\nclasses would certainly improve the<br />\nquality of Intersession as well.<br />\nIn a discussion on the social shortcomings of Intersession, the report calls for<br />\nrelaxed organized activities including a<br />\nspeaker series, one or more film series,<br />\nday trips to surrounding points of interest in the mid-Atlantic region, and<br />\nfaculty/student lunches and dinners.<br />\nUnfortunately, all of these worthwhile<br />\nrecommendations seem to have been<br />\nforgotten or shelved indefinitely.<br />\nBeyond the C.U.S. proposal, there are<br />\ntwo more fundamental changes that<br />\nwould ensure a continually strong Intersession program. First, the administration should add Intersession to<br />\nthe teaching requirements of all newly<br />\nhired faculty. A stipulation that each<br />\nfaculty member must teach at least one<br />\nIntersession course every four or five<br />\nyears in not a particularly demanding or<br />\nunreasonable addition to faculty<br />\nworkloads. Such an addition would, over<br />\ntime, ensure a supply of top-notch instructors at no additional expense to the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nSecondly, all Intersession courses<br />\nought to be offered as part of the standard university curriculum. Payment of<br />\nHopkins' annual tuition should entitle a<br />\nstudent to Intersession classes just as it<br />\nentitles a student to take classes during<br />\nthe regular academic year.<br />\nBy charging for certain Intersession<br />\ncourses on a class by class basis (like the<br />\nnew intensive language and computer<br />\ncourses) the University is more likely to<br />\nturn students away than entice them to<br />\nspend their vacations at Hopkins.<br />\nIt's clear that Intersession needs to be<br />\nimproved if it is to survive. It's also clear<br />\nthat the University is falling short in efforts to improve the program. By finally implementing the suggestions proposed in the C.U.S. report two years ago<br />\nand making a firm commitment to the<br />\nprogram in terms of faculty and<br />\nfinances, the University will certainly be<br />\non the road to making Intersession<br />\nbecome what it should be\u2014the highlight<br />\nof the academic calendar.<br />\n<br />\nPoster Anarchy<br />\nIn the aftermath of emotionally charged dramas like the protests and arrests<br />\nlast week, it's probably natural for a<br />\ncampus to focus its attentions on matters less weighty. But this week, the talk<br />\naround Homewood has changed from<br />\nthe serious to the down-right silly\u2014<br />\nnamely, the new \"postering policy.\"<br />\nAfter last week's confrontation,<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller apparently told members of the Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa that they may<br />\nposter on campus wherever they choose.<br />\nMuller's authorization of \"free\" postering was certainly made with the good intention of reconciling the participants in<br />\nan unsavory conflict. Unfortunately<br />\nthough, his authorization destroyed a<br />\nreasonably worakble poster policy in ef-<br />\n<br />\nfect for two years.<br />\nThe purpose of the old poster policy<br />\nwas to encourage the free exchange of<br />\ninformation in a clean and sightly way.<br />\nBy limiting posters to bulletin boards, the<br />\npolicy has had a pronounced effect on<br />\nimproving the cleanliness of the campus.<br />\nNow \"postering anarchy\" seems to be<br />\non the verge of returning. But there is a<br />\nsimple solution. Campus groups should<br />\nvoluntarily continue to obey the old<br />\nposter policy and the Coalition should<br />\ntake the lead in complying.<br />\nNo one wants to see the campus cluttered with paper, tacks and tape. If<br />\nMuller decided to compromise the beauty of the campus a bit, let's ignore him,<br />\nkeep the campus clean, and get back to<br />\nworrying about more important matters.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Octopus, the Feminist,<br />\nthe Censorship...The Reply\"<br />\nIn reply to a request from<br />\nDean Matthew Crenson, regarding said poster, I am putting<br />\nin writing the reasons behind<br />\nmy use of said poster. Before<br />\nsuch justification is given,<br />\nhowever, I would like to begin<br />\nby making clear that my sole intent in using the print was in no<br />\nway meant to malign nor<br />\ndegrade women, the Women's<br />\nCoalition, nor any other group<br />\nor individual, on or off cam-<br />\n<br />\nwild imagination. It was, and<br />\nstill is my opinion, that the<br />\nprint represents two distinct<br />\nimages.<br />\nOne, an allegory of nature,<br />\ndepicting the harmonious fusion of earth (i.e., woman)and<br />\nsea (i.e., sea creature), set<br />\nagainst a background (their bed<br />\nif you will), of mountain and<br />\nwater. The second image apparent, is that of woman in<br />\nfulfillment of her own sexual<br />\nfantasy. To my eye, it is a sensitive (albeit bizarre) portrayal<br />\nof woman in pursuit of<br />\n<br />\nkarla steffens<br />\npus. In fact, the opposite intent<br />\nwas had, and I believe<br />\nunderstood, by many I've<br />\nspoken with concerning this<br />\nmatter. This letter, then, is to<br />\nbe viewed not as a challenge,<br />\nbut as an attempt at reconciling<br />\nthe differences, and reaching a<br />\nmutually satisfying understanding of our rights, freedoms,<br />\nand responsibilities as citizens<br />\nof planet earth.<br />\nWeeks ago, while browsing<br />\nthrough the books on sale at the<br />\nUniversity bookstore, a female<br />\nfriend and I found and purchased a beautiful book of<br />\nprints, Japanese Erotica of the<br />\nfifteenth and sixteenth century.<br />\nI was quite impressed by the<br />\ncollection of prints, as well as,<br />\nin awe of the candor and imagination the artists had in<br />\ndepicting various forms of<br />\nlovemaking. The accompanying poetry the book contained<br />\nwas both stirring and gentle.<br />\nwhen I first saw the print I<br />\nlater chose to use for the<br />\nreading, I was overwhelmed by<br />\nits boldness, its verve, and its<br />\n<br />\npleasure. Her own for a<br />\nchange. And although oral sex<br />\nis by definition illegal in the<br />\nstate of Maryland, I would surmise that it is an activity, nevertheless, still practiced by a few<br />\nof the more radical among us.<br />\nThat most of us have never<br />\nentertained the idea of octopus<br />\nas sexual partner though, is<br />\nperhaps most to the point. This<br />\nprint is not a realistic rendering<br />\nof woman objectified by octopus. It is fantasy. It is<br />\nallegory. It is, of course, up to<br />\nyou.<br />\nNow, as to my reasons<br />\nbehind choosing said print for<br />\nmy reading, first and foremost,<br />\nI loved the print and wanted,<br />\nquite innocently, to share it.<br />\nThe old \"Look, look, what I<br />\nfound, isn't it beautiful\" syndrome. Call me excitable. But<br />\ndon't call me sexist. Second, it<br />\nwas agreed by those I shared it<br />\nwith that it was, a wonderul,<br />\nloving, gentle, bizarre, imaginative, strangely repulsive,<br />\nContinued on Page 12<br />\n<br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nA.J.

The deans also fail<br />\nto mention that the bulk of the<br />\nplanning did not, in fact, occur<br />\nin the fraternity house, but actually occurred on the<br />\nHomewood campus without<br />\nthe knowledge of those other<br />\nmembers who remained at the<br />\n<br />\nRafael Gray<br />\nLoren Heilweil<br />\n<br />\nfraternity house.<br />\nSecond, the deans are also<br />\nmistaken about an atmosphere<br />\nof tolerance created by those<br />\nfive or six fraternity brothers<br />\nwho were not fully aware of the<br />\nintentions of the three individuals convicted with the<br />\nshanty burning. Not only did<br />\nthe other brothers expressly<br />\nrepudiate the idea, but further<br />\nthere is an incorrect presumption that all the nonparticipants had reason to<br />\nbelieve that the others were<br />\nserious about their intentions.<br />\nCertainly, the deans do not suggest that any of the fraternity<br />\nbrothers had the foresight to<br />\npredict the consequences. To<br />\nconclude or even imply that<br />\nthere was tacit approval of the<br />\nresult would be unfair at best.<br />\nThe Delta Upsilon Fraternity was established on four<br />\nhonorable principles, one of<br />\nthem being \"the Advancement<br />\nof Justice.\" Hence, any member<br />\nwho acts in a manner which is<br />\ninconsistent with those principles is disciplined or expelled<br />\nfrom the organization as dictated by the Constitution of the<br />\nFraternity.

This call for<br />\ndivestment has recently been<br />\nechoed by a large number of<br />\nHopkins faculty, and indeed by<br />\nfaculty, students, and educated<br />\npeople across the nation. The<br />\nviews on the situation by President Muller, who is himself between a rock and a hard place,<br />\nhave also been voiced.<br />\nBut in all the hoopla<br />\ngenerated by this activity, there<br />\nhas been a profound silence on<br />\nthe part of 59 men and women<br />\nwho must be quite concerned.<br />\nThey are the members of the<br />\nBoard of Trustees of this<br />\nUniversity. It is they who must<br />\nrespond to the shrieking alarm,<br />\nand only they who can act to<br />\nensure a righteous longevity for<br />\nthis institution. As financial<br />\npillars who control the University's endowment, they are<br />\ndeeply implicated in this international political affair.<br />\nWho are these folks and why<br />\nare they so silent? If they<br />\nemerge soon with a plan for<br />\ndivestment, the limelight of<br />\ncongratulation will be cast upon<br />\nthem. If they wait much longer,<br />\nthey will lose the opportunity<br />\nand become villains in the<br />\nstruggle for human rights.<br />\nRichard Chisolm<br />\nPart-Time Instructor<br />\nSchool of Continuing Studies<br />\n<br />\nLack of Foresight<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nThe recent controversies over<br />\ndivestment and the University's<br />\nshanty policy have been marked by repeated failures to think<br />\nactions through with an eye<br />\ntoward the end results. The<br />\nTrustees' policy regarding shanties is a prime example of such<br />\n<br />\na failure. In August the<br />\nTrustees banned shanties. Last<br />\nmonth a court order prohibiting shanties was obtained.<br />\nThis eventually led to the arrest<br />\nof fourteen protestors. The<br />\nUniversity then urged the city to<br />\ndrop charges, and the Trustees<br />\ndecided to allow shanties on the<br />\nlower quad. This sad order of<br />\nevents points to one of two<br />\npossibilities: either the University does not know what to do<br />\nor it knows what to do but is<br />\nafraid of the consequences.<br />\nWhichever is true, it is obvious<br />\nthat the potential results of the<br />\ninitial policy were not fully considered by the Trustees.<br />\nAlso, there is a failure to see<br />\nthe eventual outcome of permitting protest by construction<br />\nproject. If the shanties are<br />\nallowed then surely the disarmament people could have a devastated village of burnt wood<br />\nand twisted steel to protest<br />\nnuclear arms and the APL's<br />\nwork on their delivery systems.<br />\nAnimal rights activists could<br />\nbuild animal pens and display<br />\nrabbits<br />\nmistreated<br />\nand<br />\nmonkeys. The shanties are a<br />\nprecedent and these other<br />\nthings can surely follow.<br />\nA similar absence of<br />\nforesight plagues the prodivestment faction. In his<br />\ndefense of divestment last<br />\nweek, Thom Kuelhs pointed<br />\nout that the Afrikaners are<br />\narmed to the teeth and more<br />\nthan willing to fight it out.<br />\nFrom this terrible fact he concludes that divestment must be<br />\nour policy. Yet, it is precisely<br />\nbecause of this fact that we<br />\nmust restrain ourselves from<br />\nemotionally rushing into a<br />\ndestructive policy. It is true that<br />\nthe South African situation has<br />\nbeen getting worse, but does<br />\nanyone really believe that U.S.<br />\ndivestment will improve things?<br />\nIt will not. Instead it will<br />\n<br />\nhasten the coming of civil war.<br />\nThe end of western and<br />\nAmerican influence, as embodied in the Sullivan principles, will leave blacks at the<br />\nmercy of Boer reaction rather<br />\nthan Boers at the mercy of<br />\nblack revolution. The Coalition<br />\nand groups like it should not be<br />\nprodding South African blacks<br />\nand whites toward the abyss of<br />\nrace war.<br />\nIt is amazing that people<br />\nassociated with this University<br />\ncould display such a lack of<br />\nforesight on these issues.

Yet, there is the<br />\nview that divestment is<br />\nDETRIMENTAL to the plight<br />\nof \"Coloreds\" in the Republic.<br />\nConsequently, one would hope<br />\nthat you see the intolerance of<br />\nyour approach. And further,<br />\nyour \"requests for feedback\"<br />\nfrom the Trustees have been<br />\npaid so little attention to<br />\nbecause, to be frank, they probably know what you have to<br />\nsay, have been that route<br />\nbefore, and have seen the fiery<br />\noutcome.<br />\nSince neither side seems likely to come 'round to the other's<br />\nway of thinking, clearly the<br />\nquestion becomes one of<br />\nauthority. One doesn't have to<br />\nbe an anthropology major to<br />\nsee that respect of authority is<br />\n<br />\nmore than a little important in<br />\nthat wind-swept plain across<br />\nCharles Street. Besides, I<br />\nshould think that our University students would be embarrassed by the exhibitionism that<br />\nhas characterized this last week<br />\nhere, not simply because Channel 11, that last bastion of<br />\ncareful analysis, covered the<br />\nshow from start to finish, but<br />\nbecause we lose a certain dignty with all this hollering. A<br />\nuniversity is not a forum for<br />\nfreedom of obnoxious expression. It is an institution of learning, higher or lower, but of<br />\nlearning. What obstructs the act<br />\nof learning is detrimental to the<br />\nsoul of' the community and consequently should be removed to<br />\nwithout the confines of the<br />\nschool. So can one be faulted<br />\nfor enforcing authority that is<br />\ndesigned to maintain the purpose of this place, as most of us<br />\nsee it?

However,<br />\nthere might be some unanswered questions, like \"Okay,<br />\nso the mansion at the top of the<br />\nbeach once belonged to Charles<br />\nCarroll, but what does that<br />\nhave to do with Johns<br />\nHopkins?\" You might wonder<br />\nwhy Gilman Hall--the heart of<br />\nthis campus--appears to be such<br />\na self-contained building.<br />\nHomewood campus has a<br />\nrich history. A few buildings<br />\nwere built long before the<br />\nUniversity was even a twinkle<br />\nin Johns Hopkins' eye.<br />\nOthers were built for the<br />\nUniversity's move from its<br />\ndowntown campus to Homewood; still, these early structures often served a much different purpose then than they<br />\ndo now.<br />\nEarly plans show that the<br />\ncampus was intended to be<br />\nmuch bigger, and in a different<br />\nlocation, than it is now. The<br />\noriginal designers had Johns<br />\nHopkins' own estate, Clifton<br />\n(now known as Clifton Park at<br />\nthe end of 33rd Street), in mind<br />\n<br />\nfor the \"new\" campus. It was<br />\nfor this reason that 33rd Street<br />\nwas widened; the gates of the<br />\nUniversity were to have opened<br />\nonto 33rd. However, by the<br />\ntime plans actually got underway, Clifton had already been<br />\ndonated to the city. Now the<br />\nonly gates opening onto 33rd<br />\nare those of Clifton Park.<br />\nalternative<br />\nThe<br />\nsite,<br />\nHomewood, was chosen.<br />\nWilliam Keyser, one of' the<br />\nUniversity Trustees, owned part<br />\nof the land. Samuel Wyman<br />\nowned Homewood and was<br />\nconvinced to sell it to Hopkins.<br />\nBetween the two, Hopkins acquired a great deal of land. Had<br />\nthe original planners had their<br />\nway, this campus would have<br />\nstretched from 29th Street to<br />\nUniversity Parkway, and from<br />\nCalvert all the way to the<br />\nRotunda. The University later<br />\ngave the property south of Art<br />\nMuseum Drive to the city; it is<br />\nnow known as Wyman Park.<br />\nMuch of the property on the<br />\nnorthwest end of campus was<br />\nkept as a park.<br />\nThe bust of Johns Hopkins<br />\nlocated just south of 34th Street<br />\non Charles used to be the<br />\ncenterpiece of the now nonexistent Hopkins Circle, a traffic<br />\ncircle in the middle of Charles<br />\nright in front of the Homewood<br />\nHouse. The bust was moved in<br />\nthe 1930's after two fire trucks<br />\ntragically collided in the circle.<br />\nTake a walk back in time to<br />\nthe days of Charles Carroll and<br />\nwatch how Homewood grows<br />\nfrom a country estate into the<br />\nhome base for one of the nation's premier universities.<br />\n<br />\nAerial view of Gilman Hall, circa 1920's.

The clso tennis courts are now the sites of .<br />\nAmes and Mergenthaler Halls. Studebakers rather than students used the paths around the upper quad. Two<br />\nfeatures of Hopkins' past are the Botanical Cardens next to the Greenhouse and Samuel W)man's ltalianate<br />\nvilla (now the site of the Garland Hall parking lot.)<br />\nBelow:<br />\nThese plans for the University date from 1906. None of these buildings were ever constructed, except for<br />\nthe Greenhouse(m) and the Botanical Gardens. In later plans, the axis of the University was shifted to run<br />\nparallel to Charles Street; hence, a modern view of the campus will show the Greenhouse to be askew to the<br />\nrest of the buildings.<br />\n<br />\nThe Carroll Mansion: First House at Homewood<br />\n<br />\nby Mary Cinder<br />\n<br />\nPerched comfortably above<br />\nthe grassy expanse known as<br />\n:\"the beach,\" Homewood<br />\nHouse looks out over today's<br />\nsunbathers and frisbee players<br />\nwith the same equanimity as it<br />\nlooked out over the gracious<br />\nentertaining done by the family of Charles Carroll, Jr., the<br />\noriginal occupants of the<br />\nbuilding.

The building<br />\nwill be opened as a public<br />\nmuseum in April or May of<br />\n1987.<br />\nThe idea, according to Mary<br />\nButler of University Collections, was to do a \"museumquality restoration\" of the<br />\nstructure. Says Butler, \"We're<br />\nnot doing anything to the house<br />\nthat cannot be authenticated<br />\nfrom when the Carrolls lived<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nFrom all accounts, the Car-<br />\n<br />\nrolls not only lived there--they<br />\nlived there in style. The Carroll<br />\nmansion, as it was tlaen called,<br />\nwas built in 1801 by Charles<br />\nCarroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, as a wedding gift for his son, Charles<br />\nJr., and his wife Harriet Chew.<br />\nThe mansion was really only a<br />\nsummer home for.the Carrolls,<br />\na \"county seat\" where they<br />\ncould escape the city in summer<br />\nand entertain lavishly.<br />\nToday Homewood House is<br />\nwidely regarded as an outstand-<br />\n<br />\nWt. 111\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\no\"<br />\n<br />\n.4<br />\n/<br />\n<br />\n4,<br />\n./1/\u2022 ,<br />\n/<br />\n./V<br />\n<br />\n1st<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n.UHR,Mc?VJ,'UPIMRSITY<br />\n... t<br />\n<br />\nAr<br />\n\u2022<br />\nMITUI<br />\n<br />\n?Sm.<br />\n,\u2022\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n&A<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\ning example of the Georgian<br />\nstyle of architecture, but even<br />\nthen it was a landmark. Construction of the mansion was<br />\nnot totally completed until 1806<br />\nand cost Carroll Sr. about<br />\n$40,000. Having planned to<br />\nspend what he considered a<br />\nvery generous $10,000, he was<br />\nrather discomfited when his<br />\nson's tastes for home furnishing<br />\nran to such great expense. According to information provided by the Hamburger Archives,<br />\nCarroll wrote to his son, calling<br />\nthe $40,000 \"a most improvident waste of money, and one<br />\nwhich you will have reason, as<br />\nlong as you live, to look back<br />\nupon with painful regret.\"<br />\nThe historical importance<br />\nHomewood House is largely<br />\ndue to its Georgian architecture<br />\n(which strongly influenced the<br />\nrest of the buildings on campus), but is also due to Carroll<br />\nJr.'s belief that no expense<br />\nshould be spared. According to<br />\nButler, the Carrolls were at that<br />\ntime one of the richest families<br />\nin America--they could afford<br />\nto be innovative. \"We have<br />\nfound things you just don't<br />\nfind in other 19th century<br />\n<br />\nhouses; thirty years later,<br />\nmaybe, but not in 1801 or 1802.<br />\nThe Carrolls were doing things<br />\nother people couldn't afford.\"<br />\nCarroll Jr. died in 1825 and<br />\nhis son, Charles Ill, inherited<br />\nHomewood.

After the war, however,<br />\nstudent enrollment increased,<br />\nand housing needs became a<br />\ncritical concern. Simultaneously, university alumni were searching for an appropriate war<br />\nmemorial to honor Hopkins<br />\nmen who had been killed in the<br />\nwar. Conveniently, the decision<br />\nto establish the Alumni<br />\nMemorial Dormitory took care<br />\nof both these concerns.<br />\nFunding for the new dormitory was conducted through<br />\nan extensive campaign begun<br />\nby the Hopkins Alumni<br />\nAssociation, headed by George<br />\nL. Radcliffe. The alumni felt<br />\nthat the dormitory would be-a<br />\nliving memorial to their<br />\ncolleagues.<br />\nA tablet was erected by the<br />\nalumni on the inside left wall as<br />\nyou enter the dormitory bearing the names of all the<br />\nHopkins men who gave their<br />\nlives to their country in the war.<br />\nInterestingly enough, however,<br />\nwhen plans to name the<br />\n<br />\nseparate houses went into effect<br />\nin 1957, the houses were named for famous individuals from<br />\nHopkins' past, instead of for<br />\nalumni who had died in the<br />\nwar, as would seem appropriate. It was the students who<br />\nhad suggested naming the entrances in this way, thereby<br />\nreplacing the old and very dull<br />\nlabels of A,B,C, etc. No one<br />\nreally knows why the students<br />\ndid not suggest that the entrances be named for the war<br />\nveterans that were killed.<br />\nPerhaps the decision was made<br />\non the basis that there were not<br />\nenough entrances to honor each<br />\nof the 24 alumni that had been<br />\nkilled.<br />\nIn any event the new<br />\nresidence, which was based on<br />\nthe English system of<br />\n\"houses,\" consisted of six<br />\nhouses, each with its separate<br />\nentrance, and a common dining<br />\nhall, with kitchen and service<br />\nrooms, and also a living or<br />\n\"commons\" room.

Wu<br />\nThe Alex Willis/Barnstormers production of David<br />\nMamet's \"Squirrels\" is<br />\ndominated by Chat Ewing, who<br />\nplays a man with a peculiar preoccupation.<br />\nEwing is Arthur, a man not<br />\nonly obsessed with squirrels,<br />\nbut also writing a sprawling<br />\nmetaphysical meditation about<br />\nthe creatures. He delivers a<br />\npowerful performance. His is a<br />\ncharacter unhinged, surreal.<br />\nWith menacing eyebrow<br />\nmachinations and a terse twang<br />\nin his voice, Arthur sits in his<br />\noffice and proclaims his vision:<br />\n\"He moves to stroke the squirrel and the squirrel bites his<br />\nhand. With his other hand he<br />\ngrabs the squirrel and squeezes<br />\nit until the creature dies.\" This<br />\nopening is only an introduction<br />\nto a comic and deranged quest,<br />\nthat of documenting the<br />\neverlasting conflict between<br />\nman and squirrel.<br />\nUnfortunately, when Arthur<br />\nfinally gets going with his final<br />\nclimactic man-squirrel struggle,<br />\n<br />\nhe begins to strangle his coconspirator, Edmond (Michael<br />\nRunge). As Edmond is responsible for scribbling down all of<br />\nArthur's utterances, the best<br />\nprose goes unwritten. And of<br />\ncourse, when Arthur has to<br />\nwrite for himself and his pencil<br />\nbreaks, he throws himself into<br />\na frenzy: \"Can you beat this?<br />\nCan you beat this with a large<br />\nstick? I think not...I am in the<br />\nmidst of a sentence, the pencil<br />\nsharpener is operating perfectly and the pencil breaks.\" Arthur is a logician gone mad, using cigarettes to diagram his imaginary battle scenes and<br />\nsquealing when asked what<br />\nrelationship his words have to<br />\nany meaning or how long he<br />\nhas been toiling.<br />\nEdmond is an apprentice of<br />\nsorts and Runge plays the role<br />\nwell. The dominated, stupid<br />\nEdmond could be simply a collection of nervous mannerisms.<br />\nBut Runge's subtle interpretation suits Edmond's bewildered<br />\nand eager to please personality.<br />\nAs the lesser colleague in this<br />\nproject of investigating squir-<br />\n<br />\nrels, his primary duty at first is<br />\nto take dictation and reply to<br />\nArthur demanding,\"Eh?\" The<br />\nonly inconsistency in the performance comes in scenes with<br />\nthe third , character, the old<br />\ncleaning lady (Aimie Hunt).<br />\nThere, Edmond seems to relax<br />\ninto sophistication. The worldly<br />\npersona looks clumsily donned,<br />\nill-fitting with Edmond's further development, which unfolds nicely.<br />\nAsking, \"You wanna make<br />\nlove,\" Hunt comes across with<br />\na studied, steady depiction of<br />\nthe old cleaning woman, once<br />\nArthur's lover and possibly Edmond's lover in the future.<br />\nHunt is at her best in this angry<br />\nperformance when she acts out<br />\nthe cleaning lady's own deranged little stories. Versatile and<br />\naggressive, she tells of the<br />\nFourth World in the Goolagong<br />\nSystem, with a poisonous atmosphere of Clorox. Although<br />\nmost of her ranting is more<br />\nconventional than the squirrelmongers, the Clorox always<br />\nseeps in.<br />\nThe drama chronicles the<br />\n<br />\nevolution of relationships between these three people,<br />\nsomehow stuck in this normal<br />\nworld. With a spartan presentation, director Willis has<br />\nevoked a multitude of hilarious<br />\ntwists in Mamet's work.<br />\nMamet is best known for<br />\n\"Sexual Perversity in Chicago\"<br />\nand \"Glengarry ,Glen Ross.\"<br />\nHunt explains that in this play,<br />\nhe deals with \"the process of<br />\ncreating, When the man finally achieves something, he has to<br />\nbreak away.\"<br />\nThe play is brutal and complex. It deals with the artist's<br />\nstruggle to create, using a complete universe of symbols, from<br />\nthe actually mundane squirrels<br />\nto the Civil War and sexual<br />\npolitics. To the satisfaction of<br />\nthe cynical clement, the<br />\n.characters are self-aware,<br />\nalmost ironic. Yet they also<br />\nparody introspection, belitt Ii ng<br />\ntheir self-consciousness. Arthur asks, \"You ask me about<br />\nmeaning and I respond with<br />\ngibberish. What kind of friend<br />\nam I? Are you sure you don't<br />\nhave a cupcake?\" Meanwhile,<br />\n<br />\nEdmond dares to disagree that<br />\nArt is Art and the cleaning lady<br />\ndeclares,\"You make your own<br />\nfun.\" All of this is presented on<br />\nthe plot level with the steady<br />\ndevelopment of the characters,<br />\nwhich perhaps needs clarity in<br />\nthis production. For all of the<br />\npotential hidden implications,<br />\nthe play is also accessible, thanks<br />\nto its completely developed<br />\nicons, our friends the squirrels.<br />\nThe cast and crew are<br />\nveterans of the stage at<br />\nHopkins, with the exception of<br />\nCarolyn Ewals and she professes<br />\nto be \"the best stage manager<br />\nin the whole world.\" All in all,<br />\nWillis and Company have put<br />\ntogether a drama that is not ordinary fare.

Mr. Neider offers<br />\nnothing new. With the exception of fifteen pages of obscure<br />\nmagazine writings, all of this<br />\nmaterial has appeared in books<br />\nbefore. Indeed, most of it has<br />\nbeen collected in one or another<br />\nof Mr. Neider's six previous<br />\nTwain books. Mr. Neider's<br />\nintroduction throws no new<br />\nlight on the material. The whole<br />\naffair is silly and senseless.<br />\nIn his tedious introduction,<br />\nMr. Neider says this book is<br />\naimed at both \"old and<br />\nfaithful\" Twain enthusiasts,<br />\nand new readers who wish to<br />\n\"discover\" Twain. Mark<br />\nTwain at His Best is of little<br />\nvalue to either group. It consists<br />\nof about sixty selections from<br />\nMr. Twain's novels, travel<br />\nbooks, stories, sketches, essays,<br />\nspeeches, and letters, as well as<br />\nautobiographical<br />\nsome<br />\nmaterial. Each selection is<br />\ntypically five or six pages in<br />\nlength, and not one of them exceeds twenty. Mr. Neider has<br />\n<br />\ncovered many aspects of<br />\nTwain's work, but there is<br />\nnothing unusual or special<br />\nabout his selections.<br />\nThese<br />\nselections<br />\nare<br />\npresented in a choppy, discontinuous manner that diminishes<br />\ntheir value. Three chapters<br />\nfrom A Connecticut Yankee in<br />\nKing Arthur's Court, or a half<br />\ndozen from Roughing It simply cannot stand on their own.<br />\nThese fragments may arguably<br />\nbe Twain's 'best', but when<br />\nthey are removed from their<br />\noriginal context they are poor<br />\nrepresentatives of Twain's<br />\nwork.<br />\nAny \"old and faithful<br />\nreaders of Mark Twain\" will<br />\nhave already read the bulk of'<br />\nthis book's text, and will be<br />\ndisappointed. There is nothing<br />\nnew here, and the old favorites<br />\nhave been mangled. The new<br />\n<br />\ntroduction, and it is bad. Spanning fifty-six pages, it is both a<br />\nbiographical sketch of Twain,<br />\nand a commentary on the selections. The biography is<br />\n.rudimentary, the criticism inane. Neider's only elucidation<br />\nof the material is his observation that Twain has the<br />\n...gift of gei.\" This is a<br />\nperception he is proud of, for<br />\nhe repeats it countless times.<br />\nCharles Neider is an<br />\nunabashed lover of Mark<br />\n!wain. It appears that his only<br />\ncredential as a critic is the fact<br />\nthat he has published six other<br />\nbooks related to Twain. He<br />\nshould have quit while he was<br />\nahead.

Currently, many of<br />\nthese ailments are treated with<br />\naspirin or in more serious cases<br />\nby narcotics, such as codeine.<br />\nThese drugs, though effective<br />\nby dulling the nervous system,<br />\nhave many side effects, the<br />\nmost important of which is that<br />\nthe entire body is depressed.<br />\nThe new chemicals would work<br />\nspecifically against the paincausing area. Narcotics can also<br />\nbe addictive, so physicians are<br />\nhesitant to prescribe it on a long<br />\nterm basis.<br />\nThe new chemicals can<br />\nreplace the current painkillers<br />\nand hopefully have less serious<br />\nside effects. They can be applied to a variety of ailments<br />\nbecause they work to stop the<br />\naction of bradykinin, an enzyme of the human nervous<br />\nsystem that is closely associated<br />\nwith the production of pain.<br />\nWhen the human body is injured, certain enzymes work on<br />\nbradykinin to change it from an<br />\ninactive to active state.<br />\nBradykinin then prompts the<br />\n<br />\nnerves associated with pain to<br />\nfire. Bradykinin also works to<br />\nopen blood vessels near the site<br />\nof the injury so that the white<br />\nblood cells that fight infection<br />\nwill be able to reach the injury<br />\neasier. These open blood vessels<br />\nare responsible for the inflammation that is often associated<br />\nwith an injury. The bradykinin<br />\nthat are in high concentration<br />\naround this inflamed area is<br />\nwhat causes the pain one feels<br />\nwhen pressure is applied to an<br />\ninjury.<br />\nJohn Stewart, a biochemist<br />\nfrom the University of Colorado, has synthesized over 200<br />\nchemicals that block bradykinin<br />\nfrom entering active state.<br />\nMany of these compounds are<br />\nunfortunately very \"clumsy\"<br />\nand \"somewhat unstable\".<br />\nThere is also the huge task of<br />\ntesting the chemicals on<br />\nhumans and the ethical problems associated with that<br />\ntesting.<br />\nStewart now has an agreement with Nova Pharmaceuticals, a national company<br />\ndevoted to the production of<br />\nnew experimental drugs, to<br />\nwork towards a drug that can<br />\nbe used by humans. The immediate goal is to create a<br />\ntopical painkilling lotion, since<br />\nNova feels such a lotion could<br />\nbe approved by the FDA.<br />\nBiochemist David Proud of<br />\nJohns Hopkins and Robert<br />\nNaclerio of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore are<br />\nworking towards drugs using<br />\n<br />\nskin surface<br />\nCut<br />\n<br />\nA<br />\nblood vessel<br />\n<br />\nnerve cell<br />\n<br />\ntissue<br />\n<br />\n4,<br />\n<br />\npain signal to brain<br />\n<br />\nNews-Letter Graphics<br />\n<br />\nThe mechanism of pain.

Curious about what<br />\ngoes on in the basement of<br />\nAmes Hall? We at the NewsLetter dug up this storyfrom a<br />\n1957issue when we sent a writer<br />\nto explore the world of Psychology. It tells us what was on<br />\nthe mind ofpsychologists in the<br />\n1950s. What we want to know<br />\nis why scientists are still performing the same experiments!<br />\nRussia may be ahead of the<br />\nUnited States in such things as<br />\nsatellites and missiles, but we've<br />\ngot them beat when it comes to<br />\npsychology, or at least Hopkins<br />\n.has. As every student of introductory psychology soon<br />\ndiscovers, Hopkins psychologists are constantly carrying on<br />\nexperiments\u2014making rats run<br />\nthrough mazes, putting<br />\ncockroaches on treadmills, and<br />\ngiving all the subjects of these<br />\nexperiments generous electric<br />\nshocks. And when our local<br />\n\"headshrinkers\" get tired of<br />\nplaying with animals (or when<br />\nthey've electrocuted them all),<br />\nthey start in on human<br />\nbeings\u2014especially students. Or<br />\nperhaps, as one student suggested, they consider Hopkins<br />\nstudents as just another division<br />\nof the Animal Kingdom.<br />\nWhen I received notice to<br />\n<br />\nreport for my first psychology<br />\nexperiment, I was therefore<br />\nslightly wary. Would I be forced to open various doors to get<br />\na pellet of food, receiving a<br />\ncharge of high voltage<br />\nwhenever I chose the wrong<br />\ndoor? Would I have to run<br />\nthrough a maze on a floor that<br />\nwas electrically charged?<br />\nWould my stomach be removed and replaced with a metal<br />\ntube to measure the amount of<br />\nwater I drink?<br />\nI walked shakily into the<br />\nchamber set aside for my experiment, afraid to sit down lest<br />\nthe chair be electrically charged<br />\nfearful that my every move was<br />\nbeing watched through a hole in<br />\nthe wall. The experimenter<br />\nentered the room carrying not<br />\na straight jacket or a dry cell<br />\nbattery, but a stack of<br />\nphotographs of nude(no, that's<br />\nnot a misprint) women! Maybe<br />\nthey're going to measure sex<br />\nhormone reactions, I thought<br />\nThe purpose of this little pin-up<br />\nsession was to learn whether<br />\nthere was a correlation between<br />\nart and sex. The ten photographs had been rated artistically by art critics, and it was my<br />\nduty to put them in order according to their sex appeal, then to<br />\nrite a short paragraph telling<br />\nwhy I like the one I put at the<br />\ntop of the list more than the<br />\nothers.<br />\n<br />\nThere I sat drooling for ten<br />\nminutes. Who cared about correlations beteen art and sex?<br />\nArt is art and sex is sex, and I<br />\ndefinitely preferred to enjoy\u2018the<br />\ncharms of the latter. Put them<br />\nin order? How could you decide<br />\nbetween Gina Lollobrigida and<br />\nSophia Loren, for instance? I<br />\nliked them all! With a little<br />\nprodding, however, I set to<br />\nwork and finished the experiment. It may have been difficult to decide on the order<br />\nthose charming young women<br />\nrated, but it was one of the<br />\nmost pleasant hours I ever<br />\npassed.<br />\nAssigned to my next experiment a week later, I was of<br />\ncourse delighted and in a hurry<br />\nto get there. Perhaps this time<br />\nI would have to rate live<br />\nwomen, I thought. But it turned out to be a very dull experiment indeed. A psychogist presented a series of card4<br />\ndepicting shapes and forms,<br />\nand several other subjects and<br />\nI was called upon to write down<br />\nwhat each of these forms<br />\nreminded us of. I'm afraid I<br />\nwasn't of much help, since the<br />\nwords \"shape\" and \"form\"<br />\nonly served to remind me of the<br />\nformer week's very exciting session and the voluptuous objects<br />\nwith which it had dealt.<br />\nNext came an experiment<br />\ndevised to rate college students<br />\n<br />\non their degree of masculinity followed by a few others equaland/or femininity, as the case ly dull. My last bout with the<br />\nmay happen to be. Again I was Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhopeful. Maybe we would be psychology department fulfillshown the ten photographs ed all my earlier fears of being<br />\nagain and have our heartbeat electrocuted.

It seems as to me, and I was to give her the<br />\nlogical\u2014and enjoyable\u2014a word which each brought to<br />\nmeans of measurement as any mind. Somehow the experiI could image. But all we had mentors had decided that some<br />\nto do, unfortunately, was answers were right and some<br />\nanswer a long questionnaire wrong; if you gave the wrong<br />\nwhich would then be graded to answer you received the<br />\ndetermine how well we college habitual juice.

His<br />\ndiscussion focused on the<br />\ntheories explained in his book<br />\nLovemaps. \"Lovemap\" is a<br />\nterm coined by Money, which<br />\nhe defines as \"a developmental<br />\nscheme or template in the<br />\nmind/brain of the idealized<br />\nlover and projected sexuoerotic<br />\nactivity.\" He emphasized that<br />\nan individual's lovemap is as<br />\nunique as his fingerprints.<br />\nA lovemap undergoes both<br />\nprenatal and postnatal formation and is affected by nature<br />\nand nurturing. Although a<br />\nlovemap is not completed in the<br /><br />\nbrain at birth, predilection for<br />\nmasculinity or femininity exists.<br />\nThe combined influences of the<br />\nskin senses, eyes, ears, and to<br />\na lesser extent smell and taste,<br />\nfinish the development.<br />\nMoney explained that males<br />\nare more dependent on visual<br />\nimagery for lovemap formation, while females are more incluenced by skin senses.<br />\nAccording to Money, an individual's lovemap develops<br />\nalmost fully by age eight. \"The<br />\ndevelopment occurs under the<br />\nauspices of the same people<br />\nwho give you your native<br />\nlanguage,\" he stated.<br />\n\"Unfortunately, we vandalize the normal lovemap<br />\ndevelopment of children by<br />\nconveying the idea that sex is<br />\nnasty and dirty,\" Money<br />\ndeclared. He believes that by<br />\nnot allowing children to grow<br />\nup with intact lovemaps, we are<br />\ncreating the sexual problems<br />\nthat plague our society.<br />\n\"Kids<br />\nwill<br />\nprepare<br />\nthemselves for normalcy of<br />\ndevelopment through sexualrehearsal play, if it is not driven<br />\nout of them by society,\"<br />\nMoney explained.

He believes the important issue is to discover why<br />\npeople grow up with paraphilic<br />\nlovemaps. Paraphilia is defined<br />\nas a lovemap with distortions or<br />\nperversions.<br />\nMoney discussed the mistaken notion about the connection between paraphilia and<br />\npornography. \"Paraphilia is<br />\nnot contagious, and pornography does not create<br />\nparaphilia,\" he explained.<br />\n\"The public is afraid that if you<br />\nallow people to see pornography, they will 'catch'<br />\nparaphilia.

The<br />\nSoviet government also pays<br />\nfor the few philosophy journals, such as Issues of<br />\nPhilosophy, in which the<br />\nwriters are government<br />\nemployees. In addition to funding, \"the tasks are chosen by<br />\nthe government,\" said Schneewind; the government tells the<br />\nwriters what issues to cover.<br />\nSchneewind noticed in his<br />\ntalks with the Soviets that they<br />\nwere, \"very touchy about our<br />\n[American] allegations that<br />\nthey are not free to speak<br />\nopinions.\"<br />\nAn example of this was a<br />\ndiscussion on tenure. \"We asked<br />\nthem about tenure,\" said<br />\nSchneewind,\" and told them<br />\nthat in our system we can't get<br />\nfired for saying what we think.\"<br />\nThe Americans asked the Soviets<br />\nif they could get fired for verbalizing opinions dissenting the<br />\ngovernment. \"Nobody here has<br />\ndissenting opinions,\" was the<br />\nSoviet reply.<br /><br />\nSoviet philosophy combines<br />\nwith elements of psychology and<br />\nsociology to be immediate and<br />\ninvolved with daily life. \"They<br />\ncriticize western philosophy as irrelevent and abstract,\" Schneewind observed.

C 1986 Continental Air Lines, Inc.<br /><br />\n8/OCTOBER 10, 1986<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter Japanese Artwork<br />\nThe Highlight of the Calendar Results in a Furor<br />\nEarlier this year, we discussed the recent decline of Intersession and urged<br />\nstudents and faculty alike to begin planning for that informal period of noncompetitive study early. Now that a few<br />\nweeks have passed, it's time to consider<br />\na number of specific improvements that<br />\nmight make Intersession '87 the best yet.<br />\nAlready, plans have been made to offer eleven new \"intensive\" courses in<br />\nforeign languages and computers. Those<br />\nplans are certainly a step in the right<br />\ndirection. But Intersession needs a nearly<br />\ncomplete overhaul, not just fine tuning<br />\nin language and computer course offerings. So, we advance the following<br />\nrecommendations.<br />\nFirst, the administration needs to dust<br />\noff the Intersession Proposal written by<br />\nthe Committee on Undergraduate<br />\nStudies in November, 1984, study it, and<br />\nimplement the courses of action proposed therein.<br />\nTo date, exactly one of the numerous<br />\nand well-founded recommendations in<br />\nthe C.U.S. report has been put into effect (namely the addition of special skills<br />\nclasses in languages and computers<br />\ndiscussed above). The rest of the ideas<br />\nhave apparently faded away into oblivion. There's still time, however, to blow<br />\nlife into some of the C.U.S. recommendations, and the University ought to do<br />\nso.<br />\nTo improve the academic nature of Intersession, the C.U.S. report proposes,<br />\namong other things, an emphasis on<br />\ncourse offerings in fields that have traditionally been weak at Hopkins. An array of Intersession offerings in areas like<br />\ntheater, journalism and business would<br />\ncertainly be an easy way to minimize<br />\nHopkins' shortcomings in these<br />\ndisciplines and expand the scope of the<br />\nIntersession program. Attracting professionals in such fields to teach at Intersession should be a relatively easy endeavor<br />\nconsidering the prominence of many<br />\nHopkins alumni in these diverse areas.<br />\nThe C.U.S. report also wisely suggests<br />\nthe expansion of current departmental<br />\nofferings to improve the academic nature<br />\nof Intersession. Specifically, the report<br />\nurges professors to offer survey courses<br />\nor seminars in their particular fields of<br /><br />\nresearch\u2014fields which may be too new<br />\nor \"experimental\" to be taught in the<br />\nnormal undergraduate curriculum. Such<br />\nclasses would certainly improve the<br />\nquality of Intersession as well.<br />\nIn a discussion on the social shortcomings of Intersession, the report calls for<br />\nrelaxed organized activities including a<br />\nspeaker series, one or more film series,<br />\nday trips to surrounding points of interest in the mid-Atlantic region, and<br />\nfaculty/student lunches and dinners.<br />\nUnfortunately, all of these worthwhile<br />\nrecommendations seem to have been<br />\nforgotten or shelved indefinitely.<br />\nBeyond the C.U.S. proposal, there are<br />\ntwo more fundamental changes that<br />\nwould ensure a continually strong Intersession program. First, the administration should add Intersession to<br />\nthe teaching requirements of all newly<br />\nhired faculty. A stipulation that each<br />\nfaculty member must teach at least one<br />\nIntersession course every four or five<br />\nyears in not a particularly demanding or<br />\nunreasonable addition to faculty<br />\nworkloads. Such an addition would, over<br />\ntime, ensure a supply of top-notch instructors at no additional expense to the<br />\nprogram.<br />\nSecondly, all Intersession courses<br />\nought to be offered as part of the standard university curriculum. Payment of<br />\nHopkins' annual tuition should entitle a<br />\nstudent to Intersession classes just as it<br />\nentitles a student to take classes during<br />\nthe regular academic year.<br />\nBy charging for certain Intersession<br />\ncourses on a class by class basis (like the<br />\nnew intensive language and computer<br />\ncourses) the University is more likely to<br />\nturn students away than entice them to<br />\nspend their vacations at Hopkins.<br />\nIt's clear that Intersession needs to be<br />\nimproved if it is to survive. It's also clear<br />\nthat the University is falling short in efforts to improve the program. By finally implementing the suggestions proposed in the C.U.S. report two years ago<br />\nand making a firm commitment to the<br />\nprogram in terms of faculty and<br />\nfinances, the University will certainly be<br />\non the road to making Intersession<br />\nbecome what it should be\u2014the highlight<br />\nof the academic calendar.<br /><br />\nPoster Anarchy<br />\nIn the aftermath of emotionally charged dramas like the protests and arrests<br />\nlast week, it's probably natural for a<br />\ncampus to focus its attentions on matters less weighty. But this week, the talk<br />\naround Homewood has changed from<br />\nthe serious to the down-right silly\u2014<br />\nnamely, the new \"postering policy.\"<br />\nAfter last week's confrontation,<br />\nUniversity President Steven Muller apparently told members of the Coalition<br />\nfor a Free South Africa that they may<br />\nposter on campus wherever they choose.<br />\nMuller's authorization of \"free\" postering was certainly made with the good intention of reconciling the participants in<br />\nan unsavory conflict. Unfortunately<br />\nthough, his authorization destroyed a<br />\nreasonably worakble poster policy in ef-<br /><br />\nfect for two years.<br />\nThe purpose of the old poster policy<br />\nwas to encourage the free exchange of<br />\ninformation in a clean and sightly way.<br />\nBy limiting posters to bulletin boards, the<br />\npolicy has had a pronounced effect on<br />\nimproving the cleanliness of the campus.<br />\nNow \"postering anarchy\" seems to be<br />\non the verge of returning. But there is a<br />\nsimple solution. Campus groups should<br />\nvoluntarily continue to obey the old<br />\nposter policy and the Coalition should<br />\ntake the lead in complying.<br />\nNo one wants to see the campus cluttered with paper, tacks and tape. If<br />\nMuller decided to compromise the beauty of the campus a bit, let's ignore him,<br />\nkeep the campus clean, and get back to<br />\nworrying about more important matters.<br /><br />\n\"The Octopus, the Feminist,<br />\nthe Censorship...The Reply\"<br />\nIn reply to a request from<br />\nDean Matthew Crenson, regarding said poster, I am putting<br />\nin writing the reasons behind<br />\nmy use of said poster. Before<br />\nsuch justification is given,<br />\nhowever, I would like to begin<br />\nby making clear that my sole intent in using the print was in no<br />\nway meant to malign nor<br />\ndegrade women, the Women's<br />\nCoalition, nor any other group<br />\nor individual, on or off cam-<br /><br />\nwild imagination. It was, and<br />\nstill is my opinion, that the<br />\nprint represents two distinct<br />\nimages.<br />\nOne, an allegory of nature,<br />\ndepicting the harmonious fusion of earth (i.e., woman)and<br />\nsea (i.e., sea creature), set<br />\nagainst a background (their bed<br />\nif you will), of mountain and<br />\nwater. The second image apparent, is that of woman in<br />\nfulfillment of her own sexual<br />\nfantasy. To my eye, it is a sensitive (albeit bizarre) portrayal<br />\nof woman in pursuit of<br /><br />\nkarla steffens<br />\npus. In fact, the opposite intent<br />\nwas had, and I believe<br />\nunderstood, by many I've<br />\nspoken with concerning this<br />\nmatter. This letter, then, is to<br />\nbe viewed not as a challenge,<br />\nbut as an attempt at reconciling<br />\nthe differences, and reaching a<br />\nmutually satisfying understanding of our rights, freedoms,<br />\nand responsibilities as citizens<br />\nof planet earth.<br />\nWeeks ago, while browsing<br />\nthrough the books on sale at the<br />\nUniversity bookstore, a female<br />\nfriend and I found and purchased a beautiful book of<br />\nprints, Japanese Erotica of the<br />\nfifteenth and sixteenth century.<br />\nI was quite impressed by the<br />\ncollection of prints, as well as,<br />\nin awe of the candor and imagination the artists had in<br />\ndepicting various forms of<br />\nlovemaking. The accompanying poetry the book contained<br />\nwas both stirring and gentle.<br />\nwhen I first saw the print I<br />\nlater chose to use for the<br />\nreading, I was overwhelmed by<br />\nits boldness, its verve, and its<br /><br />\npleasure. Her own for a<br />\nchange. And although oral sex<br />\nis by definition illegal in the<br />\nstate of Maryland, I would surmise that it is an activity, nevertheless, still practiced by a few<br />\nof the more radical among us.<br />\nThat most of us have never<br />\nentertained the idea of octopus<br />\nas sexual partner though, is<br />\nperhaps most to the point. This<br />\nprint is not a realistic rendering<br />\nof woman objectified by octopus. It is fantasy. It is<br />\nallegory. It is, of course, up to<br />\nyou.<br />\nNow, as to my reasons<br />\nbehind choosing said print for<br />\nmy reading, first and foremost,<br />\nI loved the print and wanted,<br />\nquite innocently, to share it.<br />\nThe old \"Look, look, what I<br />\nfound, isn't it beautiful\" syndrome. Call me excitable. But<br />\ndon't call me sexist. Second, it<br />\nwas agreed by those I shared it<br />\nwith that it was, a wonderul,<br />\nloving, gentle, bizarre, imaginative, strangely repulsive,<br />\nContinued on Page 12<br /><br />\nThe Hopkins News-Letter<br />\nTimothy McNamara<br />\nSharon Fischman, Brad Handler<br />\nGlen Weiss<br />\nA.J.

Hieronimus was<br />\nhired by Chester Wickwire,<br />\nthen the director of Levering<br />\nHall, for $1000 after he had<br />\ndisplayed some sculpture at<br />\nHopkins.

The deans also fail<br />\nto mention that the bulk of the<br />\nplanning did not, in fact, occur<br />\nin the fraternity house, but actually occurred on the<br />\nHomewood campus without<br />\nthe knowledge of those other<br />\nmembers who remained at the<br /><br />\nRafael Gray<br />\nLoren Heilweil<br /><br />\nfraternity house.<br />\nSecond, the deans are also<br />\nmistaken about an atmosphere<br />\nof tolerance created by those<br />\nfive or six fraternity brothers<br />\nwho were not fully aware of the<br />\nintentions of the three individuals convicted with the<br />\nshanty burning. Not only did<br />\nthe other brothers expressly<br />\nrepudiate the idea, but further<br />\nthere is an incorrect presumption that all the nonparticipants had reason to<br />\nbelieve that the others were<br />\nserious about their intentions.<br />\nCertainly, the deans do not suggest that any of the fraternity<br />\nbrothers had the foresight to<br />\npredict the consequences. To<br />\nconclude or even imply that<br />\nthere was tacit approval of the<br />\nresult would be unfair at best.<br />\nThe Delta Upsilon Fraternity was established on four<br />\nhonorable principles, one of<br />\nthem being \"the Advancement<br />\nof Justice.\" Hence, any member<br />\nwho acts in a manner which is<br />\ninconsistent with those principles is disciplined or expelled<br />\nfrom the organization as dictated by the Constitution of the<br />\nFraternity.

The<br />\nUniversity then urged the city to<br />\ndrop charges, and the Trustees<br />\ndecided to allow shanties on the<br />\nlower quad. This sad order of<br />\nevents points to one of two<br />\npossibilities: either the University does not know what to do<br />\nor it knows what to do but is<br />\nafraid of the consequences.<br />\nWhichever is true, it is obvious<br />\nthat the potential results of the<br />\ninitial policy were not fully considered by the Trustees.<br />\nAlso, there is a failure to see<br />\nthe eventual outcome of permitting protest by construction<br />\nproject. If the shanties are<br />\nallowed then surely the disarmament people could have a devastated village of burnt wood<br />\nand twisted steel to protest<br />\nnuclear arms and the APL's<br />\nwork on their delivery systems.<br />\nAnimal rights activists could<br />\nbuild animal pens and display<br />\nrabbits<br />\nmistreated<br />\nand<br />\nmonkeys. The shanties are a<br />\nprecedent and these other<br />\nthings can surely follow.<br />\nA similar absence of<br />\nforesight plagues the prodivestment faction. In his<br />\ndefense of divestment last<br />\nweek, Thom Kuelhs pointed<br />\nout that the Afrikaners are<br />\narmed to the teeth and more<br />\nthan willing to fight it out.<br />\nFrom this terrible fact he concludes that divestment must be<br />\nour policy. Yet, it is precisely<br />\nbecause of this fact that we<br />\nmust restrain ourselves from<br />\nemotionally rushing into a<br />\ndestructive policy. It is true that<br />\nthe South African situation has<br />\nbeen getting worse, but does<br />\nanyone really believe that U.S.<br />\ndivestment will improve things?<br />\nIt will not. Instead it will<br /><br />\nhasten the coming of civil war.<br />\nThe end of western and<br />\nAmerican influence, as embodied in the Sullivan principles, will leave blacks at the<br />\nmercy of Boer reaction rather<br />\nthan Boers at the mercy of<br />\nblack revolution. The Coalition<br />\nand groups like it should not be<br />\nprodding South African blacks<br />\nand whites toward the abyss of<br />\nrace war.<br />\nIt is amazing that people<br />\nassociated with this University<br />\ncould display such a lack of<br />\nforesight on these issues.

A<br />\nuniversity is not a forum for<br />\nfreedom of obnoxious expression. It is an institution of learning, higher or lower, but of<br />\nlearning. What obstructs the act<br />\nof learning is detrimental to the<br />\nsoul of' the community and consequently should be removed to<br />\nwithout the confines of the<br />\nschool. So can one be faulted<br />\nfor enforcing authority that is<br />\ndesigned to maintain the purpose of this place, as most of us<br />\nsee it?

However,<br />\nthere might be some unanswered questions, like \"Okay,<br />\nso the mansion at the top of the<br />\nbeach once belonged to Charles<br />\nCarroll, but what does that<br />\nhave to do with Johns<br />\nHopkins?\" You might wonder<br />\nwhy Gilman Hall--the heart of<br />\nthis campus--appears to be such<br />\na self-contained building.<br />\nHomewood campus has a<br />\nrich history. A few buildings<br />\nwere built long before the<br />\nUniversity was even a twinkle<br />\nin Johns Hopkins' eye.<br />\nOthers were built for the<br />\nUniversity's move from its<br />\ndowntown campus to Homewood; still, these early structures often served a much different purpose then than they<br />\ndo now.<br />\nEarly plans show that the<br />\ncampus was intended to be<br />\nmuch bigger, and in a different<br />\nlocation, than it is now. The<br />\noriginal designers had Johns<br />\nHopkins' own estate, Clifton<br />\n(now known as Clifton Park at<br />\nthe end of 33rd Street), in mind<br /><br />\nfor the \"new\" campus. It was<br />\nfor this reason that 33rd Street<br />\nwas widened; the gates of the<br />\nUniversity were to have opened<br />\nonto 33rd. However, by the<br />\ntime plans actually got underway, Clifton had already been<br />\ndonated to the city.

Had<br />\nthe original planners had their<br />\nway, this campus would have<br />\nstretched from 29th Street to<br />\nUniversity Parkway, and from<br />\nCalvert all the way to the<br />\nRotunda.

The building<br />\nwill be opened as a public<br />\nmuseum in April or May of<br />\n1987.<br />\nThe idea, according to Mary<br />\nButler of University Collections, was to do a \"museumquality restoration\" of the<br />\nstructure. Says Butler, \"We're<br />\nnot doing anything to the house<br />\nthat cannot be authenticated<br />\nfrom when the Carrolls lived<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nFrom all accounts, the Car-<br /><br />\nrolls not only lived there--they<br />\nlived there in style. The Carroll<br />\nmansion, as it was tlaen called,<br />\nwas built in 1801 by Charles<br />\nCarroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, as a wedding gift for his son, Charles<br />\nJr., and his wife Harriet Chew.<br />\nThe mansion was really only a<br />\nsummer home for.the Carrolls,<br />\na \"county seat\" where they<br />\ncould escape the city in summer<br />\nand entertain lavishly.<br />\nToday Homewood House is<br />\nwidely regarded as an outstand-<br /><br />\nWt. 111\u2022\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n/<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\no\"<br /><br />\n.4<br />\n/<br /><br />\n4,<br />\n./1/\u2022 ,<br />\n/<br />\n./V<br /><br />\n1st<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n.UHR,Mc?VJ,'UPIMRSITY<br />\n... t<br /><br />\nAr<br />\n\u2022<br />\nMITUI<br /><br />\n?Sm.<br />\n,\u2022\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n&amp;A<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\ning example of the Georgian<br />\nstyle of architecture, but even<br />\nthen it was a landmark. Construction of the mansion was<br />\nnot totally completed until 1806<br />\nand cost Carroll Sr. about<br />\n$40,000. Having planned to<br />\nspend what he considered a<br />\nvery generous $10,000, he was<br />\nrather discomfited when his<br />\nson's tastes for home furnishing<br />\nran to such great expense. According to information provided by the Hamburger Archives,<br />\nCarroll wrote to his son, calling<br />\nthe $40,000 \"a most improvident waste of money, and one<br />\nwhich you will have reason, as<br />\nlong as you live, to look back<br />\nupon with painful regret.\"<br />\nThe historical importance<br />\nHomewood House is largely<br />\ndue to its Georgian architecture<br />\n(which strongly influenced the<br />\nrest of the buildings on campus), but is also due to Carroll<br />\nJr.'s belief that no expense<br />\nshould be spared. According to<br />\nButler, the Carrolls were at that<br />\ntime one of the richest families<br />\nin America--they could afford<br />\nto be innovative. \"We have<br />\nfound things you just don't<br />\nfind in other 19th century<br /><br />\nhouses; thirty years later,<br />\nmaybe, but not in 1801 or 1802.<br />\nThe Carrolls were doing things<br />\nother people couldn't afford.\"<br />\nCarroll Jr. died in 1825 and<br />\nhis son, Charles Ill, inherited<br />\nHomewood.

After the war, however,<br />\nstudent enrollment increased,<br />\nand housing needs became a<br />\ncritical concern. Simultaneously, university alumni were searching for an appropriate war<br />\nmemorial to honor Hopkins<br />\nmen who had been killed in the<br />\nwar. Conveniently, the decision<br />\nto establish the Alumni<br />\nMemorial Dormitory took care<br />\nof both these concerns.<br />\nFunding for the new dormitory was conducted through<br />\nan extensive campaign begun<br />\nby the Hopkins Alumni<br />\nAssociation, headed by George<br />\nL. Radcliffe. The alumni felt<br />\nthat the dormitory would be-a<br />\nliving memorial to their<br />\ncolleagues.<br />\nA tablet was erected by the<br />\nalumni on the inside left wall as<br />\nyou enter the dormitory bearing the names of all the<br />\nHopkins men who gave their<br />\nlives to their country in the war.<br />\nInterestingly enough, however,<br />\nwhen plans to name the<br /><br />\nseparate houses went into effect<br />\nin 1957, the houses were named for famous individuals from<br />\nHopkins' past, instead of for<br />\nalumni who had died in the<br />\nwar, as would seem appropriate. It was the students who<br />\nhad suggested naming the entrances in this way, thereby<br />\nreplacing the old and very dull<br />\nlabels of A,B,C, etc. No one<br />\nreally knows why the students<br />\ndid not suggest that the entrances be named for the war<br />\nveterans that were killed.<br />\nPerhaps the decision was made<br />\non the basis that there were not<br />\nenough entrances to honor each<br />\nof the 24 alumni that had been<br />\nkilled.<br />\nIn any event the new<br />\nresidence, which was based on<br />\nthe English system of<br />\n\"houses,\" consisted of six<br />\nhouses, each with its separate<br />\nentrance, and a common dining<br />\nhall, with kitchen and service<br />\nrooms, and also a living or<br />\n\"commons\" room. The object<br />\nof the dormitory was said to<br />\nhave been \"to promote good<br />\nfellowship and friendliness,<br />\nparticularly among men of different ages and academic<br />\nstatus, thus regaining some of<br />\nthe spirit of an English college,<br />\nwhich has been largely lost in<br />\nAmerican universities.\"<br />\nConstructed of red brick,<br />\nand designed to complement<br />\nthe other buildings on<br />\nHomewood at this time, AMR<br />\nI looked, in 1923, much like it<br />\ndoes today. In December of<br />\n1983, however, a necessary<br />\nrenovation changed the<br />\nbuilding's interior substantially.

Indeed, without special<br />\npermission from the warden or<br />\nmanagress (the equivalent of<br />\ntoday's Director of Residential<br />\nLife), women, along with pets,<br />\nwere strictly forbidden in any of<br />\nthe dormitory rooms. But<br />\nresidents were free to stay out<br />\nas late as they wished, and as<br />\nfar as fun within the dormitory<br />\nwas concerned, the following<br />\narticle from a 1927 News-Letter<br />\nsuggests that it was as prevalent<br />\nthen as it is now:<br />\nThis year the dormitory was<br />\nthe scene of more freshmansophomore skirmishes that it<br />\nhas been in previous years...An<br />\negg encounter by the entry B<br />\nboys appropriately opened the<br />\nbanquet season at the dormitory.

Wu<br />\nThe Alex Willis/Barnstormers production of David<br />\nMamet's \"Squirrels\" is<br />\ndominated by Chat Ewing, who<br />\nplays a man with a peculiar preoccupation.<br />\nEwing is Arthur, a man not<br />\nonly obsessed with squirrels,<br />\nbut also writing a sprawling<br />\nmetaphysical meditation about<br />\nthe creatures. He delivers a<br />\npowerful performance. His is a<br />\ncharacter unhinged, surreal.<br />\nWith menacing eyebrow<br />\nmachinations and a terse twang<br />\nin his voice, Arthur sits in his<br />\noffice and proclaims his vision:<br />\n\"He moves to stroke the squirrel and the squirrel bites his<br />\nhand. With his other hand he<br />\ngrabs the squirrel and squeezes<br />\nit until the creature dies.\" This<br />\nopening is only an introduction<br />\nto a comic and deranged quest,<br />\nthat of documenting the<br />\neverlasting conflict between<br />\nman and squirrel.<br />\nUnfortunately, when Arthur<br />\nfinally gets going with his final<br />\nclimactic man-squirrel struggle,<br /><br />\nhe begins to strangle his coconspirator, Edmond (Michael<br />\nRunge). As Edmond is responsible for scribbling down all of<br />\nArthur's utterances, the best<br />\nprose goes unwritten. And of<br />\ncourse, when Arthur has to<br />\nwrite for himself and his pencil<br />\nbreaks, he throws himself into<br />\na frenzy: \"Can you beat this?<br />\nCan you beat this with a large<br />\nstick? I think not...I am in the<br />\nmidst of a sentence, the pencil<br />\nsharpener is operating perfectly and the pencil breaks.\" Arthur is a logician gone mad, using cigarettes to diagram his imaginary battle scenes and<br />\nsquealing when asked what<br />\nrelationship his words have to<br />\nany meaning or how long he<br />\nhas been toiling.<br />\nEdmond is an apprentice of<br />\nsorts and Runge plays the role<br />\nwell. The dominated, stupid<br />\nEdmond could be simply a collection of nervous mannerisms.<br />\nBut Runge's subtle interpretation suits Edmond's bewildered<br />\nand eager to please personality.<br />\nAs the lesser colleague in this<br />\nproject of investigating squir-<br /><br />\nrels, his primary duty at first is<br />\nto take dictation and reply to<br />\nArthur demanding,\"Eh?\" The<br />\nonly inconsistency in the performance comes in scenes with<br />\nthe third , character, the old<br />\ncleaning lady (Aimie Hunt).<br />\nThere, Edmond seems to relax<br />\ninto sophistication. The worldly<br />\npersona looks clumsily donned,<br />\nill-fitting with Edmond's further development, which unfolds nicely.<br />\nAsking, \"You wanna make<br />\nlove,\" Hunt comes across with<br />\na studied, steady depiction of<br />\nthe old cleaning woman, once<br />\nArthur's lover and possibly Edmond's lover in the future.<br />\nHunt is at her best in this angry<br />\nperformance when she acts out<br />\nthe cleaning lady's own deranged little stories. Versatile and<br />\naggressive, she tells of the<br />\nFourth World in the Goolagong<br />\nSystem, with a poisonous atmosphere of Clorox. Although<br />\nmost of her ranting is more<br />\nconventional than the squirrelmongers, the Clorox always<br />\nseeps in.<br />\nThe drama chronicles the<br /><br />\nevolution of relationships between these three people,<br />\nsomehow stuck in this normal<br />\nworld. With a spartan presentation, director Willis has<br />\nevoked a multitude of hilarious<br />\ntwists in Mamet's work.<br />\nMamet is best known for<br />\n\"Sexual Perversity in Chicago\"<br />\nand \"Glengarry ,Glen Ross.\"<br />\nHunt explains that in this play,<br />\nhe deals with \"the process of<br />\ncreating, When the man finally achieves something, he has to<br />\nbreak away.\"<br />\nThe play is brutal and complex. It deals with the artist's<br />\nstruggle to create, using a complete universe of symbols, from<br />\nthe actually mundane squirrels<br />\nto the Civil War and sexual<br />\npolitics. To the satisfaction of<br />\nthe cynical clement, the<br />\n.characters are self-aware,<br />\nalmost ironic. Yet they also<br />\nparody introspection, belitt Ii ng<br />\ntheir self-consciousness. Arthur asks, \"You ask me about<br />\nmeaning and I respond with<br />\ngibberish. What kind of friend<br />\nam I? Are you sure you don't<br />\nhave a cupcake?\" Meanwhile,<br /><br />\nEdmond dares to disagree that<br />\nArt is Art and the cleaning lady<br />\ndeclares,\"You make your own<br />\nfun.\" All of this is presented on<br />\nthe plot level with the steady<br />\ndevelopment of the characters,<br />\nwhich perhaps needs clarity in<br />\nthis production. For all of the<br />\npotential hidden implications,<br />\nthe play is also accessible, thanks<br />\nto its completely developed<br />\nicons, our friends the squirrels.<br />\nThe cast and crew are<br />\nveterans of the stage at<br />\nHopkins, with the exception of<br />\nCarolyn Ewals and she professes<br />\nto be \"the best stage manager<br />\nin the whole world.\" All in all,<br />\nWillis and Company have put<br />\ntogether a drama that is not ordinary fare. The play is witty<br />\nand intriguing and the actors<br />\nexciting. As Arthur says, there<br />\nis more to life than a facility to<br />\nuse modifiers.

Mr. Neider offers<br />\nnothing new. With the exception of fifteen pages of obscure<br />\nmagazine writings, all of this<br />\nmaterial has appeared in books<br />\nbefore. Indeed, most of it has<br />\nbeen collected in one or another<br />\nof Mr. Neider's six previous<br />\nTwain books. Mr. Neider's<br />\nintroduction throws no new<br />\nlight on the material. The whole<br />\naffair is silly and senseless.<br />\nIn his tedious introduction,<br />\nMr. Neider says this book is<br />\naimed at both \"old and<br />\nfaithful\" Twain enthusiasts,<br />\nand new readers who wish to<br />\n\"discover\" Twain. Mark<br />\nTwain at His Best is of little<br />\nvalue to either group. It consists<br />\nof about sixty selections from<br />\nMr. Twain's novels, travel<br />\nbooks, stories, sketches, essays,<br />\nspeeches, and letters, as well as<br />\nautobiographical<br />\nsome<br />\nmaterial. Each selection is<br />\ntypically five or six pages in<br />\nlength, and not one of them exceeds twenty. Mr. Neider has<br /><br />\ncovered many aspects of<br />\nTwain's work, but there is<br />\nnothing unusual or special<br />\nabout his selections.<br />\nThese<br />\nselections<br />\nare<br />\npresented in a choppy, discontinuous manner that diminishes<br />\ntheir value. Three chapters<br />\nfrom A Connecticut Yankee in<br />\nKing Arthur's Court, or a half<br />\ndozen from Roughing It simply cannot stand on their own.<br />\nThese fragments may arguably<br />\nbe Twain's 'best', but when<br />\nthey are removed from their<br />\noriginal context they are poor<br />\nrepresentatives of Twain's<br />\nwork.<br />\nAny \"old and faithful<br />\nreaders of Mark Twain\" will<br />\nhave already read the bulk of'<br />\nthis book's text, and will be<br />\ndisappointed. There is nothing<br />\nnew here, and the old favorites<br />\nhave been mangled. The new<br /><br />\ntroduction, and it is bad. Spanning fifty-six pages, it is both a<br />\nbiographical sketch of Twain,<br />\nand a commentary on the selections. The biography is<br />\n.rudimentary, the criticism inane. Neider's only elucidation<br />\nof the material is his observation that Twain has the<br />\n...gift of gei.\" This is a<br />\nperception he is proud of, for<br />\nhe repeats it countless times.<br />\nCharles Neider is an<br />\nunabashed lover of Mark<br />\n!wain. It appears that his only<br />\ncredential as a critic is the fact<br />\nthat he has published six other<br />\nbooks related to Twain. He<br />\nshould have quit while he was<br />\nahead.

Currently, many of<br />\nthese ailments are treated with<br />\naspirin or in more serious cases<br />\nby narcotics, such as codeine.<br />\nThese drugs, though effective<br />\nby dulling the nervous system,<br />\nhave many side effects, the<br />\nmost important of which is that<br />\nthe entire body is depressed.<br />\nThe new chemicals would work<br />\nspecifically against the paincausing area. Narcotics can also<br />\nbe addictive, so physicians are<br />\nhesitant to prescribe it on a long<br />\nterm basis.<br />\nThe new chemicals can<br />\nreplace the current painkillers<br />\nand hopefully have less serious<br />\nside effects. They can be applied to a variety of ailments<br />\nbecause they work to stop the<br />\naction of bradykinin, an enzyme of the human nervous<br />\nsystem that is closely associated<br />\nwith the production of pain.<br />\nWhen the human body is injured, certain enzymes work on<br />\nbradykinin to change it from an<br />\ninactive to active state.<br />\nBradykinin then prompts the<br /><br />\nnerves associated with pain to<br />\nfire. Bradykinin also works to<br />\nopen blood vessels near the site<br />\nof the injury so that the white<br />\nblood cells that fight infection<br />\nwill be able to reach the injury<br />\neasier. These open blood vessels<br />\nare responsible for the inflammation that is often associated<br />\nwith an injury. The bradykinin<br />\nthat are in high concentration<br />\naround this inflamed area is<br />\nwhat causes the pain one feels<br />\nwhen pressure is applied to an<br />\ninjury.<br />\nJohn Stewart, a biochemist<br />\nfrom the University of Colorado, has synthesized over 200<br />\nchemicals that block bradykinin<br />\nfrom entering active state.<br />\nMany of these compounds are<br />\nunfortunately very \"clumsy\"<br />\nand \"somewhat unstable\".<br />\nThere is also the huge task of<br />\ntesting the chemicals on<br />\nhumans and the ethical problems associated with that<br />\ntesting.<br />\nStewart now has an agreement with Nova Pharmaceuticals, a national company<br />\ndevoted to the production of<br />\nnew experimental drugs, to<br />\nwork towards a drug that can<br />\nbe used by humans. The immediate goal is to create a<br />\ntopical painkilling lotion, since<br />\nNova feels such a lotion could<br />\nbe approved by the FDA.<br />\nBiochemist David Proud of<br />\nJohns Hopkins and Robert<br />\nNaclerio of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore are<br />\nworking towards drugs using<br /><br />\nskin surface<br />\nCut<br /><br />\nA<br />\nblood vessel<br /><br />\nnerve cell<br /><br />\ntissue<br /><br />\n4,<br /><br />\npain signal to brain<br /><br />\nNews-Letter Graphics<br /><br />\nThe mechanism of pain.

Curious about what<br />\ngoes on in the basement of<br />\nAmes Hall? We at the NewsLetter dug up this storyfrom a<br />\n1957issue when we sent a writer<br />\nto explore the world of Psychology. It tells us what was on<br />\nthe mind ofpsychologists in the<br />\n1950s. What we want to know<br />\nis why scientists are still performing the same experiments!<br />\nRussia may be ahead of the<br />\nUnited States in such things as<br />\nsatellites and missiles, but we've<br />\ngot them beat when it comes to<br />\npsychology, or at least Hopkins<br />\n.has. As every student of introductory psychology soon<br />\ndiscovers, Hopkins psychologists are constantly carrying on<br />\nexperiments\u2014making rats run<br />\nthrough mazes, putting<br />\ncockroaches on treadmills, and<br />\ngiving all the subjects of these<br />\nexperiments generous electric<br />\nshocks. And when our local<br />\n\"headshrinkers\" get tired of<br />\nplaying with animals (or when<br />\nthey've electrocuted them all),<br />\nthey start in on human<br />\nbeings\u2014especially students. Or<br />\nperhaps, as one student suggested, they consider Hopkins<br />\nstudents as just another division<br />\nof the Animal Kingdom.<br />\nWhen I received notice to<br /><br />\nreport for my first psychology<br />\nexperiment, I was therefore<br />\nslightly wary. Would I be forced to open various doors to get<br />\na pellet of food, receiving a<br />\ncharge of high voltage<br />\nwhenever I chose the wrong<br />\ndoor? Would I have to run<br />\nthrough a maze on a floor that<br />\nwas electrically charged?<br />\nWould my stomach be removed and replaced with a metal<br />\ntube to measure the amount of<br />\nwater I drink?<br />\nI walked shakily into the<br />\nchamber set aside for my experiment, afraid to sit down lest<br />\nthe chair be electrically charged<br />\nfearful that my every move was<br />\nbeing watched through a hole in<br />\nthe wall. The experimenter<br />\nentered the room carrying not<br />\na straight jacket or a dry cell<br />\nbattery, but a stack of<br />\nphotographs of nude(no, that's<br />\nnot a misprint) women! Maybe<br />\nthey're going to measure sex<br />\nhormone reactions, I thought<br />\nThe purpose of this little pin-up<br />\nsession was to learn whether<br />\nthere was a correlation between<br />\nart and sex. The ten photographs had been rated artistically by art critics, and it was my<br />\nduty to put them in order according to their sex appeal, then to<br />\nrite a short paragraph telling<br />\nwhy I like the one I put at the<br />\ntop of the list more than the<br />\nothers.<br /><br />\nThere I sat drooling for ten<br />\nminutes. Who cared about correlations beteen art and sex?<br />\nArt is art and sex is sex, and I<br />\ndefinitely preferred to enjoy\u2018the<br />\ncharms of the latter. Put them<br />\nin order? How could you decide<br />\nbetween Gina Lollobrigida and<br />\nSophia Loren, for instance? I<br />\nliked them all! With a little<br />\nprodding, however, I set to<br />\nwork and finished the experiment. It may have been difficult to decide on the order<br />\nthose charming young women<br />\nrated, but it was one of the<br />\nmost pleasant hours I ever<br />\npassed.<br />\nAssigned to my next experiment a week later, I was of<br />\ncourse delighted and in a hurry<br />\nto get there. Perhaps this time<br />\nI would have to rate live<br />\nwomen, I thought. But it turned out to be a very dull experiment indeed. A psychogist presented a series of card4<br />\ndepicting shapes and forms,<br />\nand several other subjects and<br />\nI was called upon to write down<br />\nwhat each of these forms<br />\nreminded us of. I'm afraid I<br />\nwasn't of much help, since the<br />\nwords \"shape\" and \"form\"<br />\nonly served to remind me of the<br />\nformer week's very exciting session and the voluptuous objects<br />\nwith which it had dealt.<br />\nNext came an experiment<br />\ndevised to rate college students<br /><br />\non their degree of masculinity followed by a few others equaland/or femininity, as the case ly dull.
