The general intent was<br />\nto express optimism about the coming<br />\nyear at Hopkins in regards to student life<br />\nand the future of the University. To say<br />\nthat \"a reversal of this trend\"(the decline<br />\nof the University) has occured because<br />\nOrientation was good this year is<br />\nadmirably \u2022optimistic but also<br />\ndangerously simplistic. Without even<br />\ndiscussing the wide range of problems<br />\nfacing this shcool, just a consideration of<br />\nthe nature of undergraduate life as taken<br />\nup in this editorial leads to a less hopeful<br />\nconclusion than indicated.<br />\nWhat is dangerous is to conclude from<br />\nsuperficial events that deep structural<br />\nchanges are occuring. The situation is<br />\nsimilar to the Nixonic politics of rhetoric<br />\nand. show rather than concrete change.<br />\niast year's Fine Arts Festival is another<br />\ngood example.

Both Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nand President Muller topped the list of<br />\ntheir priorities with diversifi cation of the<br />\nundergtaduate education. Yet the<br />\nadmissions figures and the undergraduate<br />\ncourse listings for this fall semester<br />\nreflect the failure of the rhetoric. One<br />\ngets much the same feeling when reading<br />\nthe latest unemployment and inflation<br />\nfigures after listening to Nixon, Schultz,<br />\net. al.<br />\nPage three: \"Eleven tapped to fill<br />\nfaculty vacancies.\" As the<br />\nadministration's faculty freeze (page<br />\none) continues, some do get thawed. New<br />\nscience appointees outnumber their<br />\nnon-science colleagues while the<br />\ndecimated English department remains<br />\nunderstaffed. And does one dare raise the<br />\nghosts of the Education and Russian<br />\ndepartments, so soon forgotten? These<br />\nare the symptons of the continuing<br />\nidentity crisis for the Hopkins<br />\nundergtaduate school -science institute<br />\nor liberal arts college?

And how many of these<br />\nixople invoved in the fine arts could feel<br />\nthat their work was accepted by their<br />\nschool as valid academic-educational<br />\nendeavor? The answers to these questions<br />\nadmonish one from concluding that the<br />\nFestival was more than an entertainment<br />\nshow.<br />\nThis is not to say that grientation was<br />\nnot done well this year or that the<br />\nFestival was had on the contrary it was<br />\nwonderful. And indeed there are signs of<br />\nimprovement in underfraduate life.<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick's appointment is<br />\nencouraging and exciting. But the<br />\ninternal signs of disease remain as a<br />\nquick review of that same News-Letter<br />\nissue will reveal.<br />\nPage five: \"Freshman class sets a new<br />\nrecord for natural science majors for the<br />\nsecond year in a row.\" For three years I<br />\nhave heard of the \"new recruiting drive\"<br />\nfor more non-science undergraduates.<br />\nLincoln Gordon, the political scientist,<br />\n<br />\ndiscussion is demanded. Surely the issue<br />\nis not dead nor can it be covered up by a<br />\npretty arts festival or a smooth<br />\norientation. Students and faculty shape<br />\nthe character of a University, and thus<br />\nadmissions results and faculty hirings are<br />\ncrucial.<br />\nThe issue then is the continuing<br />\nhumanization of undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins, a process which<br />\nrequires steps in both academic and<br />\nnon-academic areas. There is no doubt<br />\nthat a feel ing of positivism about<br />\nHopkins is beneficial if not imperative for<br />\nthe well-being of the school. And yes the<br />\ncampus is quieter and a little happier. But<br />\none must not be satisfied with the<br />\nappearance of progress\u2014a feeling fed by<br />\nlast week's editorial. For all those<br />\nactively concerned with the viability of<br />\nHopkins as an undergraduate school, the<br />\nhumanization of Homewood must<br />\ncontinue to be a major concern.<br />\n<br />\nBy BERNIE COHEN<br />\nI must confess that I looked forward<br />\nto writing this post-mortem (really a<br />\nreview of a work-in -progress) on the first<br />\nweek of Orientation 72 with all the<br />\nenthusiasm you normal folks would<br />\nmuster for a watermelon -spitting contest<br />\nwith Eddie Arnold as referee.<br />\nThere are two schools of thought with<br />\nrespect to undergraduate orientation<br />\nprograms. The more common, and the<br />\napproach which has over the years<br />\nachieved great popularity here, is based<br />\non a crystal-clear concept originally<br />\nenunciated by Mr. Phineas T. Barnum.<br />\nThis approach is called, \"Never give a<br />\nsuccker an even break.\" This form of<br />\norientation stresses the importance of<br />\nlong lines, self-created social activities<br />\n(like reading the catalogue), as opposed<br />\nto a coordinated program of music and<br />\nentertainment, complete disregard for the<br />\negos and potentialities of the students<br />\nbeing oriented, and, in general,<br />\nemphasizes the singular pulchritude of<br />\nthose things already a stolid part of<br />\n<br />\nand concern for each incoming student as<br />\nan individual. This does not mean that<br />\nSavitz, or John Colmers, an Orientation<br />\nCo-Chairman whose canonization would<br />\nbe assured were the decision left to Mrs.<br />\nLebo alone, or even I went to shake each<br />\nnew student's hand, giving him a tacit<br />\nkick in the ass as he or she left our reception grounds.<br />\nRather, through a concerted effort be-<br />\n<br />\nEwing's rubber stamp, which one perceptive undergraduate observed to \"lack<br />\nhumanity.\" Of course, a scathing condemnation of Homewood's advising setup by last spring's prestigious Case Study<br />\nhelped make a virtue of necessity.<br />\nIn trying to get everything straightened out, we ran into many fuck-ups,<br />\nwhich I learned to explain away as<br />\n\"numerous difficulties\" inherent in any<br />\n<br />\nacatiercita. k\u2018eXmAxl.k 41.16.1).taxxces<br />\n<br />\nalcohol, lectures oN the dangers of drugs,<br />\nlectures on the dangers of intercourse and<br />\nmasturbation, and discussions of the<br />\nmenstrual cycle.<br />\n, Students are also shown how to write a<br />\ncheck, and how to select books for their<br />\ncourses.<br />\nSacred Trust<br />\nThe second sort of orientation is based<br />\non Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes'<br />\nnow-famous remark on the nature of his<br />\nsacred trust. \"If the people want to go to<br />\nHell,\" Holmes observed, \"then it's our<br />\nduty to help get them there.\" Holmes<br />\nknew what he was talking about.<br />\nMy good friend Andy Savitz, who is as<br />\ndeep in this whole escapade as I am, once<br />\nobserved that \"Hell is where the hearth<br />\nis.\" Now, Savitz has a certain ability to<br />\nturn a phrase inside-out, so that it still<br />\ncomes out smelling like his green<br />\ntee-shirt, which I am told smells not<br />\nnearly as good as his blue one. Still, the<br />\ntruth of his observation should be<br />\nmanifest.<br />\nIn Orientation 72, we have done our<br />\nbest to generate a sensation of warmth<br />\n<br />\nwould have been pleased to know that.<br />\n<br />\nreal people exist at Homewood.<br />\n<br />\nMoving-in went so smoothly that two<br />\nof the University's rent-a-cops, hired<br />\nespecially for this momentous occassion,<br />\nwere told to sit down in the shade, in<br />\norder to stop them from sending parents<br />\nwho had already waited 40 minutes to<br />\nunload, back to the rear of the unloading<br />\nline,- this time to wait 'for a chance to<br />\nseek a parking lot.

This response was overwhelming, so impressive that over 20 applicants<br />\nhad to be turned down, simply because<br />\nthere were not enough freshmen to advise.<br />\nAs if keeping tabs on 115 upperclassmen advisors were not difficult enough,<br />\nwe also had to try to coordinate the various departments into whose more-or-less<br />\ncapable hands the whole advising system<br />\nhad been thrust by well-intentioned administrators trying to replace Larry<br />\n<br />\ntransformation from the certainty of failure to the spossibility of success, or, if<br />\nyou will, a mess that does not work, to a<br />\nmess that does.<br />\nIn any event, this year's freshmen have<br />\nthe opportunity to work closely with<br />\nupperclassmen.

True to<br />\nform, the whole thing fell through. Mike<br />\nKestigian, TEP president, skipped town<br />\nfor a week, returning the night after the<br />\nmixer. He did not tell anyone, and we<br />\nwere left holding the bag.<br />\nWell, with two days to go, we decided<br />\nto salvage the mixer. Chris Helmers, CoChairman Ira Brill, and Bill Colmers got<br />\nto work. When the final tally was in, over<br />\n400 people had been on the treacherous<br />\nsoccer field, there was not a scrap of<br />\ntrash on the ground, and our loss was a<br />\nwhopping $18.

It was only a skirmish, but I<br />\nwish I had known it at the time. My<br />\n.camera had failed to make the trip down<br />\n<br />\nthe baggage ramp with the rest of my<br />\nluggage, and the lady with the very white<br />\nteeth helped me fill out the insurance<br />\nclaim form. \"And sometime this week<br />\njust phone the number I've written at the<br />\ntop of the page.

He also<br />\ntook his time reading it. \"Now, what's<br />\nyour problem?\"<br />\n(when ah saw him ah jus froze in mah<br />\ntracks.)<br />\nHis solution for the mystery of the<br />\nphone number was to write down<br />\nanother number and dial it for me at his<br />\ndesk.

According to Coach<br />\n<br />\nFREE!

The few that did<br />\nnot get in were either latecomers<br />\nor freshmen who had not<br />\npracticed in full pads during the<br />\nweek.<br />\nCoach Denny Cox had labeled<br />\nthe contest as \"a learning<br />\nexperience,\" not a game to be<br />\nwon or lost.

He<br />\nand Doyle on the first offensive<br />\ncontinually slashed through the<br />\nteam were senior Jim Ferguson at<br />\n<br />\nfullback with Pat Neary and Hal<br />\nAltman alternating at the other<br />\nhalfback slot.

The line<br />\nblocked very well and gave<br />\n<br />\nThomas the protection he needed<br />\nwhen passing.<br />\nThe defense played extremely<br />\ntough in the first hD-. Lebanon<br />\nValley did not penetrate into<br />\nHopkins territory until late in the<br />\nfirst half when the fourth<br />\ndefensive unit was in the game.<br />\nThe Flying Dutchmen scored at<br />\nthis time with a long bomb that<br />\nleft the defesnive secondary in a<br />\nstate of confusion. The second<br />\nscore for the visitors came at the<br />\nbeginning of the second half<br />\nwhen they put on a sustained<br />\ndrive the length of the field<br />\nagainst the first defense. Other<br />\nthan that, the Blue Jays kept<br />\nthem ill their territory .for most<br />\nof the second half.<br />\nThe stout Hopkins defense<br />\nforced many turnovers in the<br />\ncontest. The secondary<br />\nintercepted 4 passes with Harry<br />\nStringer, Jack Thomas, Pete<br />\nMcWilliams, and Jim Cahill each<br />\ngetting one. Mike Seider knicked<br />\ndown a crucial third down pass<br />\nand the defense recovered one<br />\nfumble.<br />\nThe first defensive line<br />\nconsisted of junior tackles Keith<br />\nKrantz .and Mike O'Brien and<br />\nsenior ends Bruce Jackson and<br />\nRick Kuehn. Rick Kowalchuk,<br />\nGunter Blocker, Duke Haggerty,<br />\nand Craig Stevens were the<br />\nlinebackers with Bill Nolan,<br />\nHarry Stringer, and Les Matthews<br />\n<br />\nin the secondary.<br />\nOutstanding freshmen in the<br />\nscrimmage were halfback Jim<br />\nCahill, quarterback Pete<br />\nMcWilliams who guided the third<br />\nteam, and Tom Cirillo. Although<br />\nnone of them started, all three<br />\nturned in outstanding<br />\nperformances for freshmen in a<br />\nvarsity scrimmage. With a little<br />\nseasoning and experience, these<br />\nfirst year men will make a<br />\ndefinite contribution to the<br />\nteam.<br />\nBut the story of the contest<br />\nwas the entire 60 man squad.<br />\nEach man made his individual<br />\ncontribution, whether blocking<br />\nfor his teammate, carrying out a<br />\nfake, or just cheering on the<br />\nsideline. The team was loose and<br />\nconfident throughout. There is<br />\nno doubt that Hopkins could<br />\nhave racked up three or four<br />\ntouchdowns if they had played<br />\nthe first unit on offense the<br />\nentire afternoon. But that was<br />\nnot the object of the scrimmage.<br />\nThe goal of viewing each player<br />\nin actual game conditions was<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nCox summed up the prospects<br />\nfor the season by stating that he<br />\nand the other coaches were<br />\npleased not only by the quantity<br />\nof players, but the quality.<br />\n\"These kids are going to play a<br />\nlot this year and, hopefully, learn<br />\na lot too.\"<br />\n<br />\nVeterans lead soccer team<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nArmed with thirteen returning<br />\nlettermen, the best freshman<br />\ncrop in many years, and a<br />\nradically different offense, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins soccer team has<br />\nbegun preparing for a serious bid<br />\nat the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference Championship.<br />\nLast years squad won seven,<br />\nlost five, and featured a weak<br />\noffense and a very strong<br />\ndefense. This years backline is<br />\neven better and Coach Robert<br />\nOliver is properly placing a<br />\ngreater emphasis on preventing<br />\ngoals than on scoring them. The<br />\nBlue Jays will employ four<br />\nfullbacks and four halfbacks,<br />\nleaving only two players as<br />\nfull-time offense men.<br />\nHeading the defense is junior<br />\ngoalie Keith Naunheim who<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\npermitted only 14 goals in 111<br />\ngames last year.

Charlie Gilman, a<br />\nsteady player, is the sophomore.<br />\nHe is aided by John Goldwine<br />\nfrom Calvert Hall, Lou<br />\nPodarieczk from Overlea's 1971<br />\nstate champs,and Joe Rutkowski<br />\nfrom Dundalk's 1969 and 1970<br />\nstate champions. Rutkowski is<br />\nthe most skilled player in a<br />\nHopkins uniform in recent years<br />\nand Oliver calls him \"the key<br />\nman on defense.\" Lurking in the<br />\nwings are senior Ed Koza, who<br />\nshould start if he can shake a<br />\nseries of nagging injuries, junior<br />\nJerry McMahon, recovering from<br />\nrecent surgery, and senior Gavin<br />\nYoungquist, returning from a<br />\nyear's absence from the sport.<br />\nIn contrast to the fullbacks,<br />\nthe midfield has a crew of college<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nveterans.

The general intent was<br />\nto express optimism about the coming<br />\nyear at Hopkins in regards to student life<br />\nand the future of the University. To say<br />\nthat \"a reversal of this trend\"(the decline<br />\nof the University) has occured because<br />\nOrientation was good this year is<br />\nadmirably \u2022optimistic but also<br />\ndangerously simplistic. Without even<br />\ndiscussing the wide range of problems<br />\nfacing this shcool, just a consideration of<br />\nthe nature of undergraduate life as taken<br />\nup in this editorial leads to a less hopeful<br />\nconclusion than indicated.<br />\nWhat is dangerous is to conclude from<br />\nsuperficial events that deep structural<br />\nchanges are occuring. The situation is<br />\nsimilar to the Nixonic politics of rhetoric<br />\nand. show rather than concrete change.<br />\niast year's Fine Arts Festival is another<br />\ngood example. Its success is interpreted as<br />\nproof that I lopkins is a culture-producing<br />\n'\u2018\u2018Ast.thlt\u2022vmN,<br />\nCaVw.<br /><br />\nwas supposed to herald new emphasis on<br />\nthe social sciences. Both Dr. Eisenhower<br />\nand President Muller topped the list of<br />\ntheir priorities with diversifi cation of the<br />\nundergtaduate education. Yet the<br />\nadmissions figures and the undergraduate<br />\ncourse listings for this fall semester<br />\nreflect the failure of the rhetoric. One<br />\ngets much the same feeling when reading<br />\nthe latest unemployment and inflation<br />\nfigures after listening to Nixon, Schultz,<br />\net. al.<br />\nPage three: \"Eleven tapped to fill<br />\nfaculty vacancies.\" As the<br />\nadministration's faculty freeze (page<br />\none) continues, some do get thawed. New<br />\nscience appointees outnumber their<br />\nnon-science colleagues while the<br />\ndecimated English department remains<br />\nunderstaffed. And does one dare raise the<br />\nghosts of the Education and Russian<br />\ndepartments, so soon forgotten? These<br />\nare the symptons of the continuing<br />\nidentity crisis for the Hopkins<br />\nundergtaduate school -science institute<br />\nor liberal arts college? Much of this may<br /><br />\ncame ti-oin the Hopkins conuwwity? of<br />\nthose that did, how many had done their<br /><br />\nas one of (heir maj.or concerns, yet little<br />\nprogress is seen, then further open<br /><br />\nwork with the help of, or despite of, the<br />\nUniversity? And how many of these<br />\nixople invoved in the fine arts could feel<br />\nthat their work was accepted by their<br />\nschool as valid academic-educational<br />\nendeavor? The answers to these questions<br />\nadmonish one from concluding that the<br />\nFestival was more than an entertainment<br />\nshow.<br />\nThis is not to say that grientation was<br />\nnot done well this year or that the<br />\nFestival was had on the contrary it was<br />\nwonderful. And indeed there are signs of<br />\nimprovement in underfraduate life.<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick's appointment is<br />\nencouraging and exciting. But the<br />\ninternal signs of disease remain as a<br />\nquick review of that same News-Letter<br />\nissue will reveal.<br />\nPage five: \"Freshman class sets a new<br />\nrecord for natural science majors for the<br />\nsecond year in a row.\" For three years I<br />\nhave heard of the \"new recruiting drive\"<br />\nfor more non-science undergraduates.<br />\nLincoln Gordon, the political scientist,<br /><br />\ndiscussion is demanded. Surely the issue<br />\nis not dead nor can it be covered up by a<br />\npretty arts festival or a smooth<br />\norientation. Students and faculty shape<br />\nthe character of a University, and thus<br />\nadmissions results and faculty hirings are<br />\ncrucial.<br />\nThe issue then is the continuing<br />\nhumanization of undergraduate<br />\neducation at Hopkins, a process which<br />\nrequires steps in both academic and<br />\nnon-academic areas. There is no doubt<br />\nthat a feel ing of positivism about<br />\nHopkins is beneficial if not imperative for<br />\nthe well-being of the school. And yes the<br />\ncampus is quieter and a little happier. But<br />\none must not be satisfied with the<br />\nappearance of progress\u2014a feeling fed by<br />\nlast week's editorial. For all those<br />\nactively concerned with the viability of<br />\nHopkins as an undergraduate school, the<br />\nhumanization of Homewood must<br />\ncontinue to be a major concern.<br /><br />\nBy BERNIE COHEN<br />\nI must confess that I looked forward<br />\nto writing this post-mortem (really a<br />\nreview of a work-in -progress) on the first<br />\nweek of Orientation 72 with all the<br />\nenthusiasm you normal folks would<br />\nmuster for a watermelon -spitting contest<br />\nwith Eddie Arnold as referee.<br />\nThere are two schools of thought with<br />\nrespect to undergraduate orientation<br />\nprograms. The more common, and the<br />\napproach which has over the years<br />\nachieved great popularity here, is based<br />\non a crystal-clear concept originally<br />\nenunciated by Mr. Phineas T. Barnum.<br />\nThis approach is called, \"Never give a<br />\nsuccker an even break.\" This form of<br />\norientation stresses the importance of<br />\nlong lines, self-created social activities<br />\n(like reading the catalogue), as opposed<br />\nto a coordinated program of music and<br />\nentertainment, complete disregard for the<br />\negos and potentialities of the students<br />\nbeing oriented, and, in general,<br />\nemphasizes the singular pulchritude of<br />\nthose things already a stolid part of<br /><br />\nand concern for each incoming student as<br />\nan individual. This does not mean that<br />\nSavitz, or John Colmers, an Orientation<br />\nCo-Chairman whose canonization would<br />\nbe assured were the decision left to Mrs.<br />\nLebo alone, or even I went to shake each<br />\nnew student's hand, giving him a tacit<br />\nkick in the ass as he or she left our reception grounds.<br />\nRather, through a concerted effort be-<br /><br />\nEwing's rubber stamp, which one perceptive undergraduate observed to \"lack<br />\nhumanity.\" Of course, a scathing condemnation of Homewood's advising setup by last spring's prestigious Case Study<br />\nhelped make a virtue of necessity.<br />\nIn trying to get everything straightened out, we ran into many fuck-ups,<br />\nwhich I learned to explain away as<br />\n\"numerous difficulties\" inherent in any<br /><br />\nacatiercita. k\u2018eXmAxl.k 41.16.1).taxxces<br /><br />\nalcohol, lectures oN the dangers of drugs,<br />\nlectures on the dangers of intercourse and<br />\nmasturbation, and discussions of the<br />\nmenstrual cycle.<br />\n, Students are also shown how to write a<br />\ncheck, and how to select books for their<br />\ncourses.<br />\nSacred Trust<br />\nThe second sort of orientation is based<br />\non Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes'<br />\nnow-famous remark on the nature of his<br />\nsacred trust. \"If the people want to go to<br />\nHell,\" Holmes observed, \"then it's our<br />\nduty to help get them there.\" Holmes<br />\nknew what he was talking about.<br />\nMy good friend Andy Savitz, who is as<br />\ndeep in this whole escapade as I am, once<br />\nobserved that \"Hell is where the hearth<br />\nis.\" Now, Savitz has a certain ability to<br />\nturn a phrase inside-out, so that it still<br />\ncomes out smelling like his green<br />\ntee-shirt, which I am told smells not<br />\nnearly as good as his blue one. Still, the<br />\ntruth of his observation should be<br />\nmanifest.<br />\nIn Orientation 72, we have done our<br />\nbest to generate a sensation of warmth<br /><br />\nwould have been pleased to know that.<br /><br />\nreal people exist at Homewood.<br /><br />\nMoving-in went so smoothly that two<br />\nof the University's rent-a-cops, hired<br />\nespecially for this momentous occassion,<br />\nwere told to sit down in the shade, in<br />\norder to stop them from sending parents<br />\nwho had already waited 40 minutes to<br />\nunload, back to the rear of the unloading<br />\nline,- this time to wait 'for a chance to<br />\nseek a parking lot.

This response was overwhelming, so impressive that over 20 applicants<br />\nhad to be turned down, simply because<br />\nthere were not enough freshmen to advise.<br />\nAs if keeping tabs on 115 upperclassmen advisors were not difficult enough,<br />\nwe also had to try to coordinate the various departments into whose more-or-less<br />\ncapable hands the whole advising system<br />\nhad been thrust by well-intentioned administrators trying to replace Larry<br /><br />\ntransformation from the certainty of failure to the spossibility of success, or, if<br />\nyou will, a mess that does not work, to a<br />\nmess that does.<br />\nIn any event, this year's freshmen have<br />\nthe opportunity to work closely with<br />\nupperclassmen.

We on the Orientation<br />\nCommittee,(arid I am sure we are joined<br />\nby each of our stUdent advisors --who are<br />\ncalled \"student assistants\"), feel that<br />\nthere is no substitute, especially on a<br />\ncampus so historically antipathetical as<br />\nours, for friendship.

True to<br />\nform, the whole thing fell through. Mike<br />\nKestigian, TEP president, skipped town<br />\nfor a week, returning the night after the<br />\nmixer. He did not tell anyone, and we<br />\nwere left holding the bag.<br />\nWell, with two days to go, we decided<br />\nto salvage the mixer. Chris Helmers, CoChairman Ira Brill, and Bill Colmers got<br />\nto work. When the final tally was in, over<br />\n400 people had been on the treacherous<br />\nsoccer field, there was not a scrap of<br />\ntrash on the ground, and our loss was a<br />\nwhopping $18. I only wish Kestigian had<br />\nbeen there.<br />\nDear Friends<br /><br />\nBy ROBERT RUBY<br />\nI must say that I was really surprised,<br />\nbecause I always just assumed that the<br />\nDevil would have his worldly<br />\nrepresentatives either in some apartment<br /><br />\n- \u2014 \u2014<br />\n_<br />\nbuildingas in Rosemary's Baby)or in a<br />\ngraveyard (as in Tom Sawyer).

It was only a skirmish, but I<br />\nwish I had known it at the time. My<br />\n.camera had failed to make the trip down<br /><br />\nthe baggage ramp with the rest of my<br />\nluggage, and the lady with the very white<br />\nteeth helped me fill out the insurance<br />\nclaim form. \"And sometime this week<br />\njust phone the number I've written at the<br />\ntop of the page. It should be straightened<br />\nout soon.\"<br />\nNow, I've never had any particular<br />\nproblems using telephones before, but<br />\nwhenever I dialed the magic number, an<br />\noperator would gently insist that it was<br />\nnon-esistent. \"No sir, there is no number<br />\nlisted for a claim department.\" It was<br />\nprobably only a handwriting error.<br />\nMistakes happen. It was a nice day for<br />\nwalking to their offices in the city.<br />\n(den ah jus had the strangest feelin,<br />\nand)<br />\nThe receptionist told me to go upstairs<br />\nand see a Mr. Lawrence.

He also<br />\ntook his time reading it. \"Now, what's<br />\nyour problem?\"<br />\n(when ah saw him ah jus froze in mah<br />\ntracks.)<br />\nHis solution for the mystery of the<br />\nphone number was to write down<br />\nanother number and dial it for me at his<br />\ndesk.

The line<br />\nblocked very well and gave<br /><br />\nThomas the protection he needed<br />\nwhen passing.<br />\nThe defense played extremely<br />\ntough in the first hD-. Lebanon<br />\nValley did not penetrate into<br />\nHopkins territory until late in the<br />\nfirst half when the fourth<br />\ndefensive unit was in the game.<br />\nThe Flying Dutchmen scored at<br />\nthis time with a long bomb that<br />\nleft the defesnive secondary in a<br />\nstate of confusion. The second<br />\nscore for the visitors came at the<br />\nbeginning of the second half<br />\nwhen they put on a sustained<br />\ndrive the length of the field<br />\nagainst the first defense. Other<br />\nthan that, the Blue Jays kept<br />\nthem ill their territory .for most<br />\nof the second half.<br />\nThe stout Hopkins defense<br />\nforced many turnovers in the<br />\ncontest. The secondary<br />\nintercepted 4 passes with Harry<br />\nStringer, Jack Thomas, Pete<br />\nMcWilliams, and Jim Cahill each<br />\ngetting one. Mike Seider knicked<br />\ndown a crucial third down pass<br />\nand the defense recovered one<br />\nfumble.<br />\nThe first defensive line<br />\nconsisted of junior tackles Keith<br />\nKrantz .and Mike O'Brien and<br />\nsenior ends Bruce Jackson and<br />\nRick Kuehn. Rick Kowalchuk,<br />\nGunter Blocker, Duke Haggerty,<br />\nand Craig Stevens were the<br />\nlinebackers with Bill Nolan,<br />\nHarry Stringer, and Les Matthews<br /><br />\nin the secondary.<br />\nOutstanding freshmen in the<br />\nscrimmage were halfback Jim<br />\nCahill, quarterback Pete<br />\nMcWilliams who guided the third<br />\nteam, and Tom Cirillo. Although<br />\nnone of them started, all three<br />\nturned in outstanding<br />\nperformances for freshmen in a<br />\nvarsity scrimmage. With a little<br />\nseasoning and experience, these<br />\nfirst year men will make a<br />\ndefinite contribution to the<br />\nteam.<br />\nBut the story of the contest<br />\nwas the entire 60 man squad.<br />\nEach man made his individual<br />\ncontribution, whether blocking<br />\nfor his teammate, carrying out a<br />\nfake, or just cheering on the<br />\nsideline. The team was loose and<br />\nconfident throughout. There is<br />\nno doubt that Hopkins could<br />\nhave racked up three or four<br />\ntouchdowns if they had played<br />\nthe first unit on offense the<br />\nentire afternoon. But that was<br />\nnot the object of the scrimmage.<br />\nThe goal of viewing each player<br />\nin actual game conditions was<br />\naccomplished.<br />\nCox summed up the prospects<br />\nfor the season by stating that he<br />\nand the other coaches were<br />\npleased not only by the quantity<br />\nof players, but the quality.<br />\n\"These kids are going to play a<br />\nlot this year and, hopefully, learn<br />\na lot too.\"<br /><br />\nVeterans lead soccer team<br />\nBy LAWRENCE WEINSTEIN<br />\nArmed with thirteen returning<br />\nlettermen, the best freshman<br />\ncrop in many years, and a<br />\nradically different offense, the<br />\nJohns Hopkins soccer team has<br />\nbegun preparing for a serious bid<br />\nat the Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference Championship.<br />\nLast years squad won seven,<br />\nlost five, and featured a weak<br />\noffense and a very strong<br />\ndefense. This years backline is<br />\neven better and Coach Robert<br />\nOliver is properly placing a<br />\ngreater emphasis on preventing<br />\ngoals than on scoring them. The<br />\nBlue Jays will employ four<br />\nfullbacks and four halfbacks,<br />\nleaving only two players as<br />\nfull-time offense men.<br />\nHeading the defense is junior<br />\ngoalie Keith Naunheim who<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\npermitted only 14 goals in 111<br />\ngames last year.
