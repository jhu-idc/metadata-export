University<br />\nPresident Dr. Steven Muller said<br />\nthat he had not been aware of<br />\nthe conflicts and that graduation<br />\nhad been scheduled unusually<br />\nlate this year because a late<br />\nLabor Day had delayed the start<br />\nof the academic year.

In response to this<br />\ncriticism, last year each divisional<br />\nceremony was scheduled for a<br />\ndifferent time.

Dr.<br />\nMuller commissioned the study<br />\nin April following his<br />\nannouncement that the faculty<br />\nwould be cut by 9% over a<br />\nthree-year period.<br />\nAccording to Dr. Greene, the<br />\nreport embodies several<br />\nprinciples. \"The committee<br />\nbelieves that the Faculty is the<br />\nheart of the University and that<br />\nany cuts should be kept to a<br />\nminimum,\" he said.<br />\nDr. Greene continued, \"any<br />\ncuts that are made shouldn't be<br />\ntaken without regard to<br />\nconsiderations of equity and<br />\nhumanity. For that reason, they<br />\nwill necessarily have to be<br />\nstretched out over a longer<br />\nperiod of time than the three<br />\nyears originally proposed by the<br />\n<br />\nAdministration.\"<br />\n\"The general considerations<br />\nwere that this is a good faculty<br />\nbut not a very large faculty,\"<br />\nDr.Muller said.\"It's a hardship to<br />\nreduce its size. However, some<br />\nreductions are possible without<br />\ndamaging the quality of the<br />\nfaculty. They should not be by<br />\nattrition because that is<br />\nhaphazard. They must be<br />\nselective, and the faculty must<br />\nhave a voice in the process.\" .<br />\nHe noted that by accidental<br />\nattrition alone the Faculty has<br />\nalready come down from about<br />\n300 to nearly the target level of<br />\n210. \"Our problem now is not to<br />\ncut down further,\" he<br />\ncommented, \"but how to<br />\ndetermine what vacancies we can<br />\nfill without building up to a level<br />\nwhich we can't support.\"<br />\nThe report also recommends<br />\nthe maintenance of the present<br />\nsystem of granting tenure, and<br />\nsuggests in detail<br />\nwhich<br />\ndepartments should be either<br />\nexpanded or reduced, or kept at<br />\n,cont. on p. 8<br />\n<br />\nBalassa, Kessler Appointed As<br />\nAcademic Council Members<br />\nBY JEFF CHAUCER<br />\nThe Academic Council has<br />\nappointed Economics Professor<br />\nDr.Bela Belassa and Chairman of<br />\nthe History of Art Department<br />\nDr. Herbert Kessler to serve for<br />\none year.<br />\nEach fall the Council appoints<br />\ntwo professors to serve-one year<br />\nterms.

The daily audience<br />\nfor these ads is estimated at<br />\n10,500 people.<br />\nThe station currently has a<br />\nbudget of $6,300, which French<br />\ndescribed as insufficient to run<br />\nboth stations. \"Our budget<br />\nrequest stayed the same, but w:<br />\nhad to contend with inflation<br />\nat the same time that we were<br />\ntrying to expand our<br />\noperations.\"<br />\nNow that it has received a<br />\nconstruction permit, it is only a<br />\nmatter of time before WJHU-FM<br />\ngoes on the air.

The<br />\nmeeting, sponsored by the Office<br />\nof the Chaplain and the New \"<br />\nPolitical Caucus, consisted mainly<br />\nof Iranians and members of<br />\npamphleteering political groups.<br />\nA native Iranian, much of<br />\nBarageni's writing has been<br />\ncritical of the<br />\nIraniaggovernment. During a visit to<br />\nIran several years ago he was<br />\njailed and tortured for three<br />\nmonths by the authorities. He<br />\nwas released only through the<br />\nefforts of organizations like<br />\nAmnesty International and the<br />\nCommittee for Artistic and<br />\nIntellectual Freedom in Iran.<br />\nDuring his speech, Baraheni<br />\naccused the Shah's government<br />\nof corruption, of destroying the<br />\nIranian economy, and of denying<br />\nIranian citizens human rights<br />\nthrough political repression,<br />\ntorture, and concentration<br />\ncamps. He emotionally<br />\ncondemned the Shah for recent<br />\ndeaths that occured when Iranian<br />\nsoldiers fired on anti-government<br />\ndemonstrators. The government<br />\nhas placed the death count at<br />\nabout 100; Baraheni said sources<br />\naware of the numbers of people<br />\nburied because of the shootings<br />\nclaimed about 1,000 were killed<br />\nby government troops.<br />\nOne of Baraheni's main<br />\nconcerns was America's support<br />\n<br />\nof the Shah. He claimed the CIA<br />\ncontrols the Iranian government,<br />\nsaying \"The friendship of the<br />\nIranians and CIA goes back to<br />\nWorld War II, when Americans<br />\nsmelled the cheap Iranian oil.\" In<br />\n1953, according to Baraheni, the<br />\nCIA helped overthrow the<br />\nexisting government and<br />\ninstituted a new government<br />\nfriendly with the U.S. This<br />\naction, like \"The Bay of Pigs, the<br />\nPhillipaines, and Vietnam, are all<br />\nbrutal tragedies performed by<br />\nAmericans against masses of<br />\ninnocent people around the<br />\nworld,\"<br />\nCurrently Ameiica supports<br />\nIran economically (as its chief<br />\narms supplier) and politically in<br />\nreturn for oil-trade advantages<br />\n(for example, Iran currently sells<br />\nthe U.S. oil at prices lower that<br />\nthe OPEC price). Baraheni<br />\ncharacterized Carter's human<br />\nrights policy as involving a<br />\ndouble standard: \"One Soviet<br />\n;dissident gets on the front page of<br />\nevery U.S. paper, with everyone<br />\ndefending him. But what happens.<br />\nwhen thousands of people die<br />\nfighting for human rights, but<br />\n'against a government allied with<br />\nthe U.S.? .... The human rights<br />\nprogram of Carter is bullshit.\"<br />\nBaraheni accused the<br />\nAmerican press of inaccuracy and<br />\ndistortion in its reporting of Iran,<br />\nsaying \"The American press is<br />\nmanipulated in the same way<br />\nthat American Universities are<br />\nmanipulated.\" The main<br />\nelements of his disatisfaction are<br />\nexhibited in the following exerpt<br />\nSeptember<br />\nfrom a<br />\n13<br />\nWashington Post article:<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br />\n<br />\nWJHU's studios underneath the New Dornis<br />\nlisteners,WJHU-FM has a poses a further problem for a<br />\ncommitment to broader- suggested November start-up date<br />\ncommunity interests than just because finals and Christmas may<br />\nHopkins.

But<br />\nperhaps more importantly, it also<br />\nspoke to this reader (at least) of<br />\nan outmoded and cynical set of<br />\nperceptions.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that you<br />\ncouch your view of acceptable<br />\nprotest towards South Africa and<br />\nits policies of apartheid in terms<br />\nof \"tangible consequences,\"potential to influence,\"tactics,\"<br />\nand \"real effects,\" for these all<br />\nevade the essence of our (in the<br />\nsense of Hopkins') dilemma:<br />\ndivestment is a distinctly ethical<br />\nand moral, rather than technical<br />\nquestion. Hence,\"real\" effects of<br />\nany action we might take to<br />\ninjure the regime in South Africa<br />\nare not strictly relevant. You are<br />\ncorrect when you point out the'<br />\nineffectual nature of divestment<br />\non our part as a \"tool\". However,<br />\neven seen in this perspective, I<br />\nobject to the utilitarian ethic<br />\nyour position is seemingly<br />\ngrounded in. We are not<br />\npolicy-makers in Washington<br />\n<br />\nwith complex linkages and<br />\nsensitivities to ponder, and hence<br />\nare morally bound to obey<br />\nethical imperatives--our position<br />\nis so much clearer.<br />\nThe self-cleansing moral action<br />\nthat is divestment has enormous<br />\nvalue (or shoud have) to<br />\nourselves, and as such is an<br />\nenormously valuable symbol. It is<br />\nnot, and indeed should not<br />\nbecome a \"grandstand play\".<br />\nSignificantly, your choice of that<br />\nterm--suitably colorful for its<br />\noverly simple context--only<br />\nserves to highlight the<br />\nshallowness of your position. The<br />\nnotion that we are only bound to<br />\nobey the moral directives of our<br />\nconscience when an audience is<br />\npresent--as suggested by your<br />\n'grandstand' imagery--is sad and<br />\nabsurd. Of course, my position,<br />\nas well as that of a great many<br />\nothers (even a few informed<br />\npeople, Mr. Wile), is based on the<br />\npremise that divestment is the<br />\nonly moral position available.<br />\nYour editorial was offensive<br />\nbecause it attacked the value of<br />\nmoral symbolism, while your<br />\nposition implied the verity of<br />\nnon-divestment as a moral<br />\nsymbol in its owl right.<br />\n(According to Mr. Wile,<br />\ndivestment is distinctly immoral.)<br />\nThat, gentlemen, is unacceptable<br />\nhypocrisy for the symbol of<br />\nstudent opinion.<br />\nAnd oh, yes: if your \"real<br />\nHomewood world\" agenda of<br />\nissues only encompasses various<br />\ncampus putterings and<br />\nbrouhahas, then where do you<br />\nget off discussing anything<br />\nvaguely significant, anyway?<br />\nJ.G. Cherim<br />\nNews Director,<br />\nRadio Station WJHU<br />\n<br />\nMoonie<br />\nTo the Editor,<br />\nI was annoyed by your<br />\nreference to Keith Moon, late<br />\ndrummer of the Who, in your<br />\nissue of Sept. IS. \"Many<br />\ndrummers are more skillful than<br />\nKeith Moon,\" etc. It should be<br />\nclear to anyone with any musical<br />\nsense that Moon was not a<br />\nmusician of average ability but<br />\nwas among the small handful of<br />\ngreat rock drummers that<br />\nincludes Charlie Watts and Ginger<br />\nBaker. His physical gifts were<br />\nconsiderable and his intelligence<br />\nand originality made him stick<br />\nout like a sore thumb in his field,<br />\nwhich is why I dare say your<br />\nintimation that as a drummer<br />\nMoon is replaceable is patently<br />\nstupid.

Mencken's Notebooks<br />\n<br />\nTwo Tuesdays ago, September 12 to be exact, was the<br />\n98th anniversary of H.L. Mencken's birth. For the most<br />\npart, the occasion went unnoticed. The Sunpapers, which<br />\nwas to Mencken as Yankee Stadium was to Babe Ruth,<br />\nran a short blurb announcing the Enoch Pratt Library's<br />\nannual Mencken Day, which consists of a lecture, a film<br />\nshowing, and the opening of the Mencken Room which is<br />\nordinarily closed to all but scholars. The reputation of the<br />\nSage of Baltimore has diminished over the years, basically<br />\nbecause his political and social bombasts, the foundation<br />\nof his renown as a critic of cheek, mean little to the<br />\npresent generation, nor even to the one before it. Not<br />\nmany people these days, outside of some scattered<br />\nHistory graduate students, know or care what Mencken<br />\nthought of Calvin Coolidge's administration. Perhaps<br />\nbetter remembered is Mencken's legendary response upon<br />\nhearing that Coolidge had died: \"How can you tell?\"<br />\nHenry i Louis Mencicen was born the oldest child ofa<br />\ncigar manufacturer in the Baltimore of 1880. Even then<br />\nBaltimore was a city of charm, and its denizens hardly<br />\nneeded the Mayor or the Chamber of Commerce to tell<br />\nthem so. (Mencken tells of a tiny wheat field that prospered near<br />\nMonument Street during the late 1880's. \"Most<br />\nBaltimoreans of that era,\" Mencken wrote,\"took a fierce,<br />\ndefiant pride in the bucolic aspects of their city.\") As a<br />\nboy, Henry and his brother Charlie roamed the alleys and<br />\nvacant lots of West Baltimore, occasionally riding their<br />\npony Frank through the town roadways. Henry's father<br />\nplanned for his eldest son to someday take over the<br />\nfamily's cigar factory, but an errant discovery at the age<br />\nof nine set the course for the rest of Mencken's life. He<br />\nread Huckelberry Finn,;an event he later described as \"the<br />\nmost stupendous of my life.\" He became a bookworm<br />\nand remained one until his graduation (with high honors)<br />\nfrom Baltimore Polytechic Institute. At the age of 16, he<br />\nabandoned his heavy reading \"in favor of life itself.\"<br />\nFor three years Mencken worked,somevvfiat unhappily, at the<br />\ncigar factory. After his father's death in 1899, he began to<br />\nhaunt the city room of the Baltimore Herald, begging<br />\nassignments. Every night for a month, the young aspiring<br />\nwriter pleaded for a job until the city editor of the Herald<br />\nMax Ways, sent him out one winter evening to see how<br />\nthe residents of a rural suburb had survived a blizzard.<br />\nMencken found nothing but the rumor of some stolen<br />\nstable equipment, and filed the following report: \"A<br />\nhorse, a buggy, and several sets of harnass, valued in all at<br />\n,about $250 , were stolen last night from the stable of<br />\nHoward Quinlan, near Kingsville. The county police are at<br />\nwork on the cases but so far no trace of either thieves or<br />\nbooty has been found.\" When the author saw his five-line<br />\narticle in the next morning's paper, his first appearance in<br />\nprint,he was ecstatic.<br />\nOne of the failures of colleges lies in their apparent<br />\nincompetence to select and train a sufficient body of<br />\nteachers. Their choice is commonly limited to<br />\nin<br />\nsecond-raters, for a man who really knows a subject is<br />\nseldom content to spend his lifetime teaching it... There<br />\n<br />\nare, of course, occasional exceptions to this rule, but they<br />\nare very rare, and none of them are to be found in the<br />\naverage college. The pedagogues there incarcerated are all<br />\ninferior men - men who really know very little about the<br />\nthings they pretend to teach, and are too stupid or too<br />\nindolent to acquire more. Being taught by them is roughly<br />\nlike being dosed in illness by third-year medical students.<br />\n-Notebooks<br />\n<br />\nWhile many of his peers studied in the shadows of<br />\nivy-covered walls, Mencken was busily climbing the ladder<br />\nof success in the journalistic field. In three years he<br />\nworked his way up to city editor of the Herald,joined<br />\nthe Sun as its Sunday editor at the age of 23, and became<br />\nan editor of the Evening Sun upon its inception in 1910.<br />\nIn 1914 he was appointed . co-editor, with his friend<br />\nGeorge Jean Nathan, of a popular New York Magazine,<br />\nthe Smart Set. Several years later, the two founded the<br />\nAmerican Mercury magazine which became the Bible of<br />\ncollege students and the literary set of the 1920's. These<br />\npublications, the Sunpapers in particular, would serve as<br />\nsounding board for the rest of his career.<br />\nSunpapers critic John Dorsey recently wrote of<br />\nMencken, \"He was against most change and all pretense,<br />\nhypocrisy and sham . He fought prohibition, censorship<br />\nand the attempt to eradicate prostitution, on the grounds<br />\nthat such crusades were useless because human nature<br />\ncannot be altered by government fiat... Mencken<br />\npossessed a sort of dogma of his own which made his<br />\nthinking consistent to the point of rigidity on many social<br />\nissues...Democratic systems, he thought, resulted in<br />\nadvancing the lowest common denominator, to the end<br />\nthat they in turn advanced people of their own kind and<br />\ncreated a country of boobs and Babbits.\" Despite all his<br />\nranting and railing, Mencken maintained a kind of amused<br />\ndetachment form his fellow countrymen, or the<br />\n\"booboisie,\" as he called them.<br />\n<br />\nPhilosophy consists very largely of one philosopher<br />\narguing that all others are jackasses. He usually proves it,<br />\nand I should add that he also usually proves that he is one<br />\nhimself<br />\n-Notebooks<br />\nMencken was not, and could not be, a philosopher. He<br />\ntook very few things, least of all himself, seriously. He<br />\nconsidered life a comedy, and felt the key to happiness<br />\nlay in the capacity to detect and relish the comic ironies<br />\nof life. \"A man who can laugh, if only at himself,\" he<br />\n<br />\nIi At1i4413IT<br />\n<br />\nty I it.14 I?

George Bernard Shaw and Voltaire<br />\nwe re two of his heroes, and their influence was<br />\nresponsible for his adopting the role of America's Number<br />\nOne social critic. At the same tiAle, he was a gifted and<br />\nastute literary critic. In his late twenties, he wrote two<br />\nbooks of criticism,one on Shaw' s plays, the other on the<br />\nplilosophy of Nietzche. Both works made the name<br />\n<br />\nJr is impossible to imagine the universe run by a wise,<br />\njust and omnipotent God, but it is quite easy to imagine it<br />\nrun by a board of Gods. If such a board actually exists it<br />\noperates precisely like the board of a corporation that is<br />\nlosing money.<br />\n<br />\n\"The Johns Hopkins is<br />\nas thoroughly practical<br />\n<br />\ninstitution as the<br />\nChicago College of<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nPaperhanging.<br />\n<br />\nillustrations by Jose Cboca<br />\n<br />\nand hard-boiled an<br />\n<br />\nWhy assume so glibly that the God who presumable<br />\ncreated the universe is still running it.

This is true, for example, of most<br />\nuniversities, and ofall great newspapers.<br />\n-Notebooks<br />\n<br />\nIf there was one thing Mencken could abide even less<br />\nthan censorship and prohibition, it was religion.

The Johns<br />\nHopkins Mencken referred to is the hospital, certainly not<br />\nthe university. Though he had great respect and<br />\nadmiration for Daniel Gilman (in fact, he wondered why<br />\nthe boulevard in front of the campus, namely Charles<br />\nStreet, had not been named after the university's first<br />\npresident), Mencken kept a dim view of the school. In the<br />\nEvening Sun of July 23, 1923, he wrote, \"Today the<br />\nJohns Hopkins is as thoroughly practical and hard-boiled<br />\nan institution as...the Chicago College of Paperhanging. I<br />\nof its Register and find<br />\nglance through the latest issue<br />\ncourses in salesmanship, in casualty insurance, in pistol<br />\nshooting, in business forecasting(whatever that may be),<br />\nin scouting and patrolling and in investments.\" Somewhere<br />\nalong the line, a Hopkins official must have taken note<br />\nfor Mencken's complaints, for none of these courses or<br />\nanything resembling them can be found in recent editions<br />\nof the JHU catalog.<br />\nFor someone who never attended college, Mencken had<br />\nsome very interesting and perceptive theories about it,<br />\nparticularly concerning its true worth to students. I quote<br />\nthe following lines from The Bathtub Hoax (1927) for<br />\ntheir poignancy to anyone currently undergoing the<br />\ntravails of higher education: \"There is error...in the<br />\nassumption that what college has to teach all comes out<br />\nof books, or may be imparted by instructors. This is not<br />\ntrue. What college has to teach, in the main, is simply<br />\nfamiliarity wiht the notions and habits of that vast and<br />\nmysterious organism known as human society...If the<br />\nyoung man at college learns nothing else save the fact that<br />\nmany of the bigwigs of the college world are charlatans,<br />\nand that position and attainments do not necessarily go<br />\ntogether, then he has learned something of the utmost<br />\nvalue.

Mencken replied, he would bow<br />\nand say,\"Gentlemen, I was wrong.\"<br />\n<br />\nit, if only by the method of the horrible example, then<br />\ngoing to college is worth while.\"<br />\nFew dumber Senators have ever adorned the Upper<br />\nhouse. The place where he sits, to all intents and<br />\npurposes, is a vacuum. He seldom has anything to say on<br />\nthe floor, and when he speaks it is substantially as if he<br />\nwere silent.

Lee<br />\nGoldsborough ofMaryland in<br />\nthe Evening Sun, July 3, 1933<br />\nMencken loved writing about politics and politicians,<br />\njust as a caricaturist enjoys drawing pictures of fat<br />\nmillionaires. The size of the office did not daunt him; he<br />\nchallenged everyone from dog catchers' to Presidents,<br />\nfrom judges to Governors. Americans of the Roaring<br />\nTwenties ate it up, savoring Mencken's bombasts as avidly<br />\nas the author himself. But when the Depression and hard<br />\ntimes hit, the country was in a less good humor. It was<br />\ndifficult to laugh at anything, much less some cocky<br />\njournalist whose ceaseless tirades only served to remind<br />\neveryone how bad things were.<br />\nAfter the 1932 election, Mencken took on FDR,<br />\nlabelling him an aristocratic tmonarch, \"Roosevelt II\". As<br />\nthe President's star rose, the writer's fell. Alistair Cooke<br />\nwrote in 1955,\"The New Deal was Mencken's Waterloo,<br />\nand Roosevelt his Wellington.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter his famous coverage of the Scopes Monkey Trial<br />\nof 1925, Mencken became a national celebrity. In 1930<br />\nhe surprised eveiyone when he bid farewell to his<br />\nbachelor's life and married writer Sara Powell Haardt. A<br />\nfact that might, or might not, endear Mencken to Hopkins<br />\nmen is that hit wife was a graduate of Goucher College.<br />\nIronically, ten years before his marriage, Mencken made<br />\nsome not too complimentary comments on Goucher in a<br />\nletter to Dr. Louise Pound: \"Goucher College is...a mere<br />\nteaching<br />\n'female seminary' ,f the usual Southern type,<br />\nMore.<br />\nIt is<br />\nHannah<br />\nof<br />\neditions<br />\nEnglish out of expurgated<br />\nJewesses.<br />\nmainly<br />\nare<br />\nstudents<br />\nrun by Methodists, but the<br />\n<br />\nMan is of the toughest ofanimated creatures.

He was<br />\nsteadily losing popularity (a fact he candidly admitted and<br />\ntook in stride), and that year his wife, Sara, died. He<br />\ncontinued writing editorials and articles for the Sun but<br />\nturned most of his energies to the work that, in<br />\nretrospect, his reputation as a great American writer rests<br />\non. Over the course of the next seven years, he produced<br />\nwhich<br />\nthree volumes of memoirs,<br />\ncollectively constitute The Days of H.L. Mencken. The<br />\nDays books reflect Mencken's brilliant command of<br />\nlanguage and his talent as a storyteller of wit and warmth.<br />\nAlong with James Thurber's My Life and Hard Times, The<br />\nDayS<br />\nH.L. Mencken ranks as one of the best humorous<br />\nautobiographies in American literature.<br />\nIf Mencken had never written his numerous newspaper<br />\nand magazine articles, his literary criticism, or his<br />\nmemoirs, he would nonetheless be remembered for his<br />\nscholarly magnum opus, The American Language.<br />\nPublished in 1918, with supplements in 1942 and 1948,<br />\nthe book is the first serious analysis of the evolution and<br />\npatterns of American speech. In 1915, before undertaking<br />\nhis prodigious project, Mencken wrote to a friend,<br />\nexpressing wonder that American scholars seemed to<br />\nscorn the slang of their native country, while most<br />\nEuropean scholars delighted in theirs. After Mencken's<br />\nstudy, tweedy academians from Cambridge to Chicago<br />\nbegan noticing the \u201edistinct poetics of English, American<br />\nstyle.<br />\nDuring the 1940's Mencken, now a man of 60-plus<br />\nyears, was less active than in earlier times. His last hurrah<br />\nwas his coverage of the 1948 Democratic convention. On<br />\nNovember 9 of that same year, Mencken published what<br />\n'as to be his last piece, an article on Baltimore race<br />\nreaitions, which was printed in the Evening Sun. Alistair<br />\nCooke wrote in The Vintage Mencken \"Two weeks later,<br />\nto the day, he had a crebral thrombosis.

The<br />\nfinished work shows an elderly gentleman in his whitehaired seventies. He is sitting back in a chair with his legs<br />\ncomfortably crossed. His left hand holds the ubiquitous<br />\ncigar, and his face wears a sad distant look of<br />\nreminiscence. This is the Mencken that will be<br />\nremembered rather than the wisecracking critic of the<br />\nTwenties whose foxy grin and cool gaze seemed to show<br />\nthrough every line of his blasts and bravos. The eyes of<br />\nthe younger Mencken were angrier and more sardonic,<br />\nwhile those of the older Mencken, the white-haired<br />\ngentleman of the Wheeler portrait, revealed \"vain regrets<br />\nand broken hopes,\" and \"the special suffering\" that is the<br />\nwriter's alone.

Patton, Sands of Iwo Jima, and All Quiet on the<br />\nWestern Front are all examples of some of great war<br />\nmovies which have become a part of our culture. But<br />\nBlack and White in Color is different. It is a film whichdeals with war and is yet not a war-movie. To an extent,<br />\nthe battles, the violence and all the horrors of war are<br />\nrepresented, but Black and White in Color is not content<br />\nto sit back and soberly preach to us. Instead it makes war<br />\nseem all the more horrible by showing us its absurdit.<br />\nBlack and White in Color is set in the West African<br />\nsavannah. The date is late 1914 and the story centers on a<br />\nFrench trading village separated from a German garrison<br />\nby a shallow river. Unknown to both sides, World War I<br />\nhas begun so the two colonies spend their time<br />\n\"civilizing\" the black natives -- the Germans through<br />\nmilitary drilling and the French by stealing as much as<br />\nhumanly possibly. The monotony of the situation is<br />\nquickly broken when the French receive some old<br />\nnewspapers which indicate that the war has been in<br />\nprogress for six months. \"Patriotism\" immediately seizes<br />\n<br />\nDESPERATE LIVING<br />\nMISFITS<br />\n<br />\nthe spirit of these Frenchmen who plan a sneak attack<br />\n(with a volunteer native army) on the Germans.<br />\nIt is here that the men who at first appear as merely a<br />\ncollection of debauched and venal petit-imperialists reach<br />\nnew levels of idiocy. It is not -enough that the priests<br />\nmake their living by selling worthless religious artif act to<br />\nthe natives or that the military commander orders his<br />\nblack orderly to find him local girls. The ultimate<br />\nabsurdity appears when this same lot of people begin to<br />\nsee themselves as the last defenders of free France. In<br />\nfact, they are so confident in their military (and spiritual)<br />\nsuperiority that they begin the war with a picnic.<br />\n'Black and White in Color as well as being an attack on<br />\nwar, is also a sharp attack on white imperialism and does<br />\nthis with a great deal of wit. By showing us the<br />\npretensiousness and the hypocrisy of the settlers and<br />\njuxtaposing this with the placid, unassuning quality of the<br />\nnatives and the landscape, Director Jean-Jacques Annaud<br />\nshows us that imperialism is not only evil, but is also a<br />\nridiculous manifestation of human vanity.<br />\nIndeed the only character in the filmwho is in any way<br />\ndifferent is transformed by the mini-war from a pariah<br />\ninto absolute and undisputed leader. Hubert Fresnoy, a<br />\nyoung man assigned to study the regional geography, is<br />\nthe sole person to warn against launching an attack and is<br />\nridiculed for it. However, it is he who emerges as the sole<br />\ncompetent man after the natives fighting for the French are<br />\ncompletely routed by the bettu-trained German natives.<br />\nIt is at this point that the film begins to deal with the<br />\nissue of leadership. Fresnoy gathers the loose strands after<br />\nthe defeat and begins to assume full authority. We see in<br />\nhim as a man who has a justified sense of his own<br />\nsuperiority, but who also is impeccably polite. In fact,<br />\nFresnoy becomes so aloof that we can see a kind of<br />\n\"Palace Guard\" evolving as he surrounds himself with a<br />\nnative staff trained in making sure Fresnoy is left alone.<br />\nBlack and White in Color received an Oscar as the Best<br />\nForeign-Film of the year in 1977, and it deserves its<br />\nrecognition.

We are<br />\nallowed to see for ourselves the contradictions and<br />\nparadoxes, and the final scene after the end of the war is<br />\nso beautifully absurd as to be a successful culmination of<br />\nall that has gone on before.<br />\n<br />\nPAUL KLEE<br />\n<br />\nptertaiimept<br />\n<br />\nPINK FLAMINGOS<br />\n<br />\nHowever, he is also irresolute, tired, and brooding.

They<br />\nare the last because the evil Cylons, bully boy super<br />\nrobots, have tricked mankind into signing a peace treaty<br />\nending 7000 years of war. Instead, the Cylons wreck all<br />\nthe planets, which are colonies of the ancient mother<br />\ncivilization Kobol and its father civilization named<br />\nFortran, as well as all of the battlestars (space battleships)<br />\nexcept Galactica. The survivors decide to head for the<br />\nmost distant colony on a planed appropriately named<br />\nEarth. This Chariots of the Gods theme runs throughout<br />\nthe series.

Inevitably, such artistry suffers on a small<br />\nscreen. Who can forget how the Clavius moonbase in the<br />\ntelevised 2001: A Space Odyssey (special effects by Doug<br />\nTrumbull) looked like a slightly classier version of Moon<br />\nEtase Alpha in Trumbull's chintzy Space:1999. So, don't<br />\nexpect to be too everwhelmed by Galactica's magic.<br />\n<br />\nSome snobs will undoubtedly say thatt BG's plot and<br />\ncharacters are too unrealistic and pedestrian. However,<br />\nany work should really only be measured against the<br />\nideal of its genre. Galactica is a space fantasy, by<br />\ndefinition unreal. Story lines are supposed to be fast<br />\npaced, interesting, uncontroversial, and good should win<br />\nover evil. Viewers usually do not fantasize heroes who are<br />\ndisagreable pot smoking zit-faced grunts who either frag<br />\ntheir officers or get hit by friendly fire. In fantasy, there<br />\nshould be characters that can be either hated or liked, not<br />\nones who are complex, fickle or weak. Turn to PBS for<br />\nthose. Thus, Adama is probably the most developed<br />\ncharacter in the series. Battlestar Galactica measures up<br />\nfar more favorably to Star Wars than does the detective<br />\nfantasy Charlie's Angels against those utterly wonderful<br />\nJames Bond films.<br />\nFinally, some party poopers, even to the point of<br />\nlitigation, claim that BG is a rip off of Star Wars. This is<br />\nsilly. Sure, the Cylons do look like Darth Vader's merry<br />\nmen, and there are similar plot sequences and characters,<br />\nThese would occur in any competent space fantasy done<br />\nnowadays. No reference is made to specific characters or<br />\nevents in the movie. One never sees R2D2 or C3P0, and<br />\nthere is nothing even similar to the Force. In fact,<br />\neveryone on Galactica seems to be athiest. Dykstra did<br />\nwork for both films, and he can hardly be blamed if the<br />\nmotifs he uses to induce fantasy are similar. They are a<br />\npart of his creative repertoire, not that of a movie studio<br />\nwho would not be rolling in money if Dykstra had not<br />\nsigned on. Galactica will not steal money from Star Wars<br />\nand its sequels. Not only are there differences between<br />\nthe detached effect of the small screen and the total<br />\ninvolvement created by the large one, but the film and its<br />\ncharacters have their own powerful mystique.<br />\nAnalogously, that is why 2001 will be remembered and<br />\nSilent Running (also done by Trumbull) will be forgotten.<br />\nBy all means, see Battlestar Galactica. It's well done<br />\nhonest escapist fun that puts on no pretensions, but is still<br />\ninoffensive. It's perfect for a Sunday evening before<br />\nanother mind eroding week of classes and working on<br />\nNews-Letter articles.

The content of the lyrics<br />\nfrom many recent releases is autobiographical, concerning<br />\nitself with questions of personal survival and creativity.<br />\nWhereas once, rock was a rather simplistic idiom with<br />\nhardly any concerns except to perform, many artists who<br />\nhave been around for countless years have suddenly<br />\nbecome aware of age and image, and have become worried<br />\nabout what comes next. One of the best examples of this<br />\nfear is Jethro Tull's album of two years ago, Too Old to<br />\nRock and Roll, Too Young to Die- if a rock artist<br />\ncannot boogie forever and is not ready to die, what<br />\nexactly is this intemediary state between music and death.<br />\nUnlike other artists, the physicality of rock and roll<br />\nmakes it virtually impossible for a rock musician to<br />\ncontinue past a certain age. Unless the person is Satchel<br />\nPaige, and the predicament of the rock musician is not<br />\nunlike that of.an athlete. After a certain number of years,<br />\nthe timing is off, the .fast ball is slow and the arm is weak<br />\nand painful; and it would seem impossible for Pete<br />\nTownshend to leap around and for Mick Jagger to swagger<br />\nhis hips forever. For all rock artists, it seems that they will<br />\neventually reach a point where they cannot go on<br />\nanymore and they must \"retire\". These autobiographical<br />\nquestions have been explored most recently on albums by<br />\nthe Kinks and the Strawbs, two mainstays of British rock.<br />\nThe Kinks have been around since the mid-Sixties, and<br />\nover the years, they have had their share of hits. Their<br />\nlater albums have not been geared towards this<br />\ncommercial success, and they have managed to maintain<br />\nonly a cult following. These albums have consisted of<br />\ntedious and uninspired self-explorations which is basically<br />\na rehashing of their older material. The new album<br />\nMisfits, though, is an exploration into these questions of<br />\nsurvival, answers to which the Kinks never before<br />\npursued. The lyrics express the struggle to retain their<br />\nstatus and dignity in a profession that is continually<br />\nshifting its views and values. \"Rock and Roll Fantasy\" is<br />\none of the most perceptive song compositions on the<br />\nIC<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nz<br />\n<br />\nII<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nalbum. It moans the despair of living in the fantasy world<br />\nof rock and roll, and the fear and uncertainty of what lies<br />\nahead in \"reality\". Misfits is a good album musically<br />\nalthough it should not change the cult status of the Kinks.<br />\nIt does represent, though, a clear and precise investigation<br />\ninto the,questions of being a rock artist and growing old,<br />\nand eventual retirement in a way that few<br />\nautobiographical albums have been able to do.<br />\nThe Strawbs new album Deadlines is autobiographical<br />\nfrom a different point of view. They are not so much<br />\nconcerned with the pains of growing old, as when the<br />\npopularity and creativity sputters so much that the band<br />\nmust consider whether it is even worthwhile to continue.<br />\nOn this album, the Strawbs have been able to stand back<br />\nand objectively view their history. Within the framework<br />\nof lyrics about false or unrequited love and journeys of<br />\nself-discovery which abound on earlier albums, the<br />\nStrawbs have created lyrical allegories that express their<br />\nobservations about the group at this juncture in time. In<br />\ndoing so, they have also created one of their finest albums<br />\never.<br />\nThe predicament of the Strawbs is not unlike the<br />\nKinks. The Strawbs have been rather prolific over the past<br />\nfew years, but their albums have passed - relatively<br />\nunnoticed. Their music departed from the captivating<br />\ncompositions that covered a range from soft love songs to<br />\nacerbic songs of protest. The most recent albums were<br />\nself-indulgent exercises in which there was no<br />\ncommunication between the artists and the listener. The<br />\nmusical and the lyrical ideas became so muddled in the<br />\nStrawbs' need for personal expression that these ideas<br />\nwere too obscure to be comprehended. The cover of<br />\nDeadlines is a reporter trying to beat a deadline, but he is<br />\nstuck inside a telephone booth that is filled with water.<br />\nThis is probably the way the Strawbs felt -- they were<br />\nunable to communicate their ideas - thus the concept of<br />\nthe new album is to express these submerged feelings as<br />\nthey try to excape from the booth. They achieve this goal<br />\nextremely well in a variety of compositions which express<br />\n, their inablility to return to their best days in the early<br />\n'X<br />\n<br />\nFRESHMEN<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\nir<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nlEX<br />\n<br />\nSeventies (No Return), feeling that they have betrayed<br />\ntheir fans (Sealed With A Traitor's Kiss), their feeling that<br />\nthis album is their last chance for survival (The Last<br />\nResort) and even a desire to begin again pursuing new<br />\ngoals (New Beginnings). The music is the best the Strawbs<br />\nhave recorded in years, and the .autobiographical concept<br />\nof the album is honest, authentic and insightful into the<br />\nfeelings of the band members at this point in their musical<br />\ncareers.<br />\nRock and roll exploded into American culture like a<br />\nFrankenstein, formless and without a history, possessing<br />\nonly raw, untamed energy. People like Buddy Holly, Bill<br />\nHaley, Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix (along with<br />\ncountless others) were totally uninhibited in their modes<br />\nof expression because there was no past to restrict them.<br />\nBut more than a generation has passed since then, and<br />\nrock and roll has taken on many forms that have become<br />\nthe standards of the art. Most of the innovators are dead,<br />\nand the ability to survive depends on how well the artist<br />\nadheres to these conventions. The standards are well set,<br />\nand it would be difficult to revolutionize them. Punk<br />\nrock, New Wave, Disco and others are fads that will not<br />\nchange the face of rock music, and in their own ways are<br />\nme rely extrapolations of conventions already well<br />\nmolded. The music of the Kinks and the Strawbs<br />\nrepresent their personal interpretations of these<br />\nconventions, and their success of failure as a band<br />\ndepends on how well listeners receive their individual<br />\nstatements. Therefore when rock artists become old and<br />\ntheir statements become obscure and misunderstood, they<br />\nmust contemplate retirement. They must give way to<br />\nyounger musicians who can still generate the original raw<br />\nenergy, and who can reinterpret the conventions of rock,<br />\ncreating a different (though not always new) statement.<br />\nThe Kinks and the Strawbs probably felt age catching up<br />\nwith them, and they were able to communicate with only<br />\na few listeners, so they were forced to consider the end of<br />\ntheir musical careers. Ironically, on their autobiographical<br />\nalbums, these two bands have recorded some of their<br />\nmost original statements in a long time.<br />\n.11CILIL<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nIt<br />\n<br />\n1MIL<br />\n<br />\nZ.<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nIC<br />\n<br />\nIT'S NOT TOO LATE!<br />\n<br />\nCONSIDER TAKING ARMY ROTC AT JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nalmoMMIMEMO<br />\n<br />\nas/<br />\n<br />\nNO OBLIGATION FIRST TWO YEARS<br />\n1 BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE FOR AN<br />\n/<br />\nARMY SCHOLARSHIP<br />\n1/LAST TWO YEARS OF PROGRAM<br />\nRECEIVE $2,500<br />\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION VISIT ROOM 200, MILITARY SCIENCE<br />\nBLDG (Behind the gym)or CALL CAPTAIN DON MILLER 338-7474 /7475<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nz<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\nX<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 16 / SEPTEMBER 22, 1978<br />\n<br />\nThe New Ambrosia<br />\nSiOecoalk Baccet<br />\n<br />\n\"You think only God<br />\ncan make a tree?<br />\nTry coming up<br />\nwith a mackerel.\"<br />\n<br />\n**<br />\n<br />\n(in the Rathskeller)<br />\n<br />\n----<br />\n<br />\n-1V1ENLI-<br />\n<br />\nMonOag, 9/25<br />\n<br />\nCaRoeo Roast Beer<br />\n1<br />\n(aa jas 0116 grzaog), .<br />\n<br />\nTaesOag,9/26<br />\n<br />\nPizza Siciliana<br />\n<br />\nSenior Class<br />\n<br />\nThaaseiag, 9/2w<br />\n<br />\nDeli (pastaarni,<br />\n<br />\ncoane-O beep, anO baabeque bear)<br />\nFaiOag, 9/29<br />\n<br />\nCaRoeb Roast Bear<br />\n(au jas anO gu_aog)<br />\n<br />\nSeaving Larch<br />\n11:30 to 2:30 p.m_<br />\nHappy Birthday<br />\n<br />\nKathy<br />\n<br />\nTERI GARR \u2022 DONALD PLEASENCE<br />\n<br />\nFilm Series<br />\npresents...<br />\nCAMREINER<br />\n<br />\n(peppeaoni,sausage,anO rnashaoorrA<br />\nc .<br />\nWe-OnesOag, 9/27 Crepes<br />\n1<br />\n<br />\nGEORGE BURNS \u2022 JOHN DENVER \u2022<br />\n<br />\nFriday & Saturday<br />\nSeptember 22 & 23<br />\n7, 9 &11 pm<br />\n<br />\nAdmission-81.00<br />\nSeniors-8 .75<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\nSpecial Showing<br />\nSunday, September 24<br />\n8 & 10 pm<br />\nShaffer 3<br />\n<br />\nP. .1!<br />\n<br />\n*DOUBLE FEATURE * DOUBLE FEATURE *<br />\n\"BLACK<br />\nCOLOR\" /<br />\n<br />\nFRIDAY<br />\nSEPTEMBER 22<br />\n7:30 & 11:30<br />\nSATURDAY<br />\nSEPTEMBER 23<br />\n9:45<br />\n<br />\nACADEMY<br />\nAWARD<br />\nWINNER<br />\nBest<br />\nForeign<br />\nFilm of<br />\nThe Year<br />\n<br />\nSHRIVER HALL * JOHNS HOPKINS * HOMEWOOD * $1 ADMISSION<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE,1 7<br />\n<br />\nWho Needs The<br />\nSOBs Anyway???<br />\n(CPS)\u2014\"Student government was a joke. It had become<br />\nan ineffective waste of money,\" explained David Haug, a<br />\nUniversity of Texas(UT)junior who heads the Coalition<br />\nto Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP). \"So our motto<br />\nbecame 'We pay $45,000 for nothing- we can get nothing<br />\nfor less than that'. And we were succesful.\"<br />\nThe \"we\" Haug is referring to is the 2644 UT students<br />\nwho voted to abolish UT's student government in a<br />\nreferendum last month. It was a close vote; 2458 students<br />\nopposed to complete abolition. But Haug feels the bulk of<br />\nthe student sentiment favored retiring a structure many<br />\nfelt was an \"albatross.\"<br />\nAnd he may, in the process, have touched a national<br />\nnerve as well. Haug has gotten letters and phone calls<br />\nfrom a number of other schools since leading the UT<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nUT's student association (SA) was beset with problems<br />\ncommon to many student governments. It was powerless,<br />\nHaug asserts, with most of its money it directly controlled<br />\ngoing for salaries. It was non-representative. This year UT<br />\nvoter turnout was the lowest in recent history, a paltry<br />\nseven percent. And many of those elected were \"political<br />\nhacks,\" Haug charges.<br />\n\"What we elect each year are the best politicians, who<br />\nthink they can sit around, pass resolutions and change the<br />\nworld. When that doesn't happen, they would either stop<br />\ncoming to meetings or retain all illusions of power.\"<br />\nMany agreed with Haug's view of UTSA's problems,<br />\nbut not everyone concurred that abolition was the<br />\nanswer. Said SA vice-president Mark Luzzatto, \"I don't<br />\nfeel people are willing to face the fact that it's not SA's<br />\nstructure at fault. If people don't get off their goddam<br />\nasses and elect effective leaders they will always have<br />\nthese problems.\"<br />\nSome felt that abolishing a structure without having<br />\nanother to take its place would leave SA open to even<br />\nmore administrative control, or that \"whatever took its<br />\nplace would have different people with different titlesbut<br />\nthe same problems,\" as one student theorized in an<br />\neditorial.<br />\nBut CRAP supporters believed that some kind of<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 Klee, Homer<br />\nExhibitions<br />\nAt Museum<br />\n<br />\nArt<br />\n<br />\nPublic Duel (1932) by Paul Klee<br />\n\"cooling off period\" is necessary to determine what is<br />\nreally needed and wanted. Haug is confident that some<br />\nplan will rise from the ashes. Various proposals have<br />\nalready surfaced, ranging from a nine-member student<br />\nboard of regents to a co-ordinator function for the<br />\nassociation, with student groups lobbying in their own<br />\ninterests.<br />\nHaug feels students are ready for something completely<br />\ndifferent. He said the abolition action was predictable as<br />\nlong as two years ago when a landslide victory was won<br />\nby a duo running on an \"Arts and Sausages\" campaign.<br />\n\"They were completely non-sensical.

The<br />\nexhibition consists of sixty-seven of Klee's finest works,<br />\nincluding oils, water -colors, gouaches, prints and<br />\ndrawings. One of the major artists of the early part of the<br />\ntwentieth century, Klee has been termed outside of<br />\nPicasso, probably more imaginative and varied in his<br />\ntechnique and style than any oCier artist in the twentieth<br />\ncentury.<br />\nPaul Klee was one of this century's most prolific,<br />\ncomplex and subtle artists. His average yearly production<br />\nwas between 250 and 300 works, and over his career he<br />\nhas recorded nearly 9000 works. Throughout his life, Klee<br />\nexplored materials and techniques, merging one medium<br />\nand method into another. As a young artist he was<br />\nprimarily a illustrator/draftsman, very linear in his<br />\norientation. However, upon returning from a short trip to<br />\nNorth Africa in 1914, he wrote in his diary, \"Color<br />\npossesses me...color and I are one.\" From that point on,<br />\nKlee emerges as colorist, producing works such as Runner<br />\nat the Goal (1921), Red Balloon (1922) and In the<br />\nCurrent Six Thresholds (1929), all included in this<br />\nexhibition.<br />\nIn addition, there is an exhibition of watercolors,<br />\nengravings and drawing by the American artist Winslow<br />\nHomer, continuing through November 5. The exhibition<br />\nexplored Homer's career as an illustrator before and after<br />\nhe turned to oil pointing. Homer's illustrations are<br />\ncarefully composed, decidedly linear works marked by<br />\nstrong contrasts between light and dark. For subject<br />\nmatter, he consistently selected outdoor scenes of both<br />\nfashionable and rural life, and also produced a number of<br />\nworks based on sketches made during numerous trips to<br />\nthe Virginia front during the Civil War.<br />\n<br />\nRATHAPPENINGS<br />\nTonight, \\<br />\nFriday<br />\n<br />\nSaturday<br />\nNight<br />\nSU PERDISCO<br />\n<br />\nLIVE DISCO<br />\nWITH<br />\nGRAND<br />\nJUNCTION<br />\n<br />\nFRIED CHICKEN PLATTERS<br />\nLEG or BREAST $1.29<br />\nWITH DELICIOUS WESTERN FRIES<br />\n<br />\nALWAYS HOT N.Y.

The<br />\nmeeting, sponsored by the Office<br />\nof the Chaplain and the New \"<br />\nPolitical Caucus, consisted mainly<br />\nof Iranians and members of<br />\npamphleteering political groups.<br />\nA native Iranian, much of<br />\nBarageni's writing has been<br />\ncritical of the<br />\nIraniaggovernment. During a visit to<br />\nIran several years ago he was<br />\njailed and tortured for three<br />\nmonths by the authorities. He<br />\nwas released only through the<br />\nefforts of organizations like<br />\nAmnesty International and the<br />\nCommittee for Artistic and<br />\nIntellectual Freedom in Iran.<br />\nDuring his speech, Baraheni<br />\naccused the Shah's government<br />\nof corruption, of destroying the<br />\nIranian economy, and of denying<br />\nIranian citizens human rights<br />\nthrough political repression,<br />\ntorture, and concentration<br />\ncamps. He emotionally<br />\ncondemned the Shah for recent<br />\ndeaths that occured when Iranian<br />\nsoldiers fired on anti-government<br />\ndemonstrators. The government<br />\nhas placed the death count at<br />\nabout 100; Baraheni said sources<br />\naware of the numbers of people<br />\nburied because of the shootings<br />\nclaimed about 1,000 were killed<br />\nby government troops.<br />\nOne of Baraheni's main<br />\nconcerns was America's support<br /><br />\nof the Shah. He claimed the CIA<br />\ncontrols the Iranian government,<br />\nsaying \"The friendship of the<br />\nIranians and CIA goes back to<br />\nWorld War II, when Americans<br />\nsmelled the cheap Iranian oil.\" In<br />\n1953, according to Baraheni, the<br />\nCIA helped overthrow the<br />\nexisting government and<br />\ninstituted a new government<br />\nfriendly with the U.S. This<br />\naction, like \"The Bay of Pigs, the<br />\nPhillipaines, and Vietnam, are all<br />\nbrutal tragedies performed by<br />\nAmericans against masses of<br />\ninnocent people around the<br />\nworld,\"<br />\nCurrently Ameiica supports<br />\nIran economically (as its chief<br />\narms supplier) and politically in<br />\nreturn for oil-trade advantages<br />\n(for example, Iran currently sells<br />\nthe U.S. oil at prices lower that<br />\nthe OPEC price). Baraheni<br />\ncharacterized Carter's human<br />\nrights policy as involving a<br />\ndouble standard: \"One Soviet<br />\n;dissident gets on the front page of<br />\nevery U.S. paper, with everyone<br />\ndefending him. But what happens.<br />\nwhen thousands of people die<br />\nfighting for human rights, but<br />\n'against a government allied with<br />\nthe U.S.? .... The human rights<br />\nprogram of Carter is bullshit.\"<br />\nBaraheni accused the<br />\nAmerican press of inaccuracy and<br />\ndistortion in its reporting of Iran,<br />\nsaying \"The American press is<br />\nmanipulated in the same way<br />\nthat American Universities are<br />\nmanipulated.\" The main<br />\nelements of his disatisfaction are<br />\nexhibited in the following exerpt<br />\nSeptember<br />\nfrom a<br />\n13<br />\nWashington Post article:<br />\ncont. on p. 9<br /><br />\nWJHU's studios underneath the New Dornis<br />\nlisteners,WJHU-FM has a poses a further problem for a<br />\ncommitment to broader- suggested November start-up date<br />\ncommunity interests than just because finals and Christmas may<br />\nHopkins.

But<br />\nperhaps more importantly, it also<br />\nspoke to this reader (at least) of<br />\nan outmoded and cynical set of<br />\nperceptions.<br />\nIt is unfortunate that you<br />\ncouch your view of acceptable<br />\nprotest towards South Africa and<br />\nits policies of apartheid in terms<br />\nof \"tangible consequences,\"potential to influence,\"tactics,\"<br />\nand \"real effects,\" for these all<br />\nevade the essence of our (in the<br />\nsense of Hopkins') dilemma:<br />\ndivestment is a distinctly ethical<br />\nand moral, rather than technical<br />\nquestion. Hence,\"real\" effects of<br />\nany action we might take to<br />\ninjure the regime in South Africa<br />\nare not strictly relevant. You are<br />\ncorrect when you point out the'<br />\nineffectual nature of divestment<br />\non our part as a \"tool\". However,<br />\neven seen in this perspective, I<br />\nobject to the utilitarian ethic<br />\nyour position is seemingly<br />\ngrounded in. We are not<br />\npolicy-makers in Washington<br /><br />\nwith complex linkages and<br />\nsensitivities to ponder, and hence<br />\nare morally bound to obey<br />\nethical imperatives--our position<br />\nis so much clearer.<br />\nThe self-cleansing moral action<br />\nthat is divestment has enormous<br />\nvalue (or shoud have) to<br />\nourselves, and as such is an<br />\nenormously valuable symbol. It is<br />\nnot, and indeed should not<br />\nbecome a \"grandstand play\".<br />\nSignificantly, your choice of that<br />\nterm--suitably colorful for its<br />\noverly simple context--only<br />\nserves to highlight the<br />\nshallowness of your position. The<br />\nnotion that we are only bound to<br />\nobey the moral directives of our<br />\nconscience when an audience is<br />\npresent--as suggested by your<br />\n'grandstand' imagery--is sad and<br />\nabsurd. Of course, my position,<br />\nas well as that of a great many<br />\nothers (even a few informed<br />\npeople, Mr. Wile), is based on the<br />\npremise that divestment is the<br />\nonly moral position available.<br />\nYour editorial was offensive<br />\nbecause it attacked the value of<br />\nmoral symbolism, while your<br />\nposition implied the verity of<br />\nnon-divestment as a moral<br />\nsymbol in its owl right.<br />\n(According to Mr. Wile,<br />\ndivestment is distinctly immoral.)<br />\nThat, gentlemen, is unacceptable<br />\nhypocrisy for the symbol of<br />\nstudent opinion.<br />\nAnd oh, yes: if your \"real<br />\nHomewood world\" agenda of<br />\nissues only encompasses various<br />\ncampus putterings and<br />\nbrouhahas, then where do you<br />\nget off discussing anything<br />\nvaguely significant, anyway?<br />\nJ.G.

His physical gifts were<br />\nconsiderable and his intelligence<br />\nand originality made him stick<br />\nout like a sore thumb in his field,<br />\nwhich is why I dare say your<br />\nintimation that as a drummer<br />\nMoon is replaceable is patently<br />\nstupid. This makes your moving<br />\neulogy, obviously written with<br />\ngood intention, rather a<br />\nleft-handed compliment.

The world, to such a man, never grows<br />\ndownright unbearable. There is always a sheet of paper.<br />\nThere is always a pen. There is always a way out.<br />\n-H.L. Mencken's Notebooks<br /><br />\nTwo Tuesdays ago, September 12 to be exact, was the<br />\n98th anniversary of H.L. Mencken's birth. For the most<br />\npart, the occasion went unnoticed. The Sunpapers, which<br />\nwas to Mencken as Yankee Stadium was to Babe Ruth,<br />\nran a short blurb announcing the Enoch Pratt Library's<br />\nannual Mencken Day, which consists of a lecture, a film<br />\nshowing, and the opening of the Mencken Room which is<br />\nordinarily closed to all but scholars. The reputation of the<br />\nSage of Baltimore has diminished over the years, basically<br />\nbecause his political and social bombasts, the foundation<br />\nof his renown as a critic of cheek, mean little to the<br />\npresent generation, nor even to the one before it. Not<br />\nmany people these days, outside of some scattered<br />\nHistory graduate students, know or care what Mencken<br />\nthought of Calvin Coolidge's administration. Perhaps<br />\nbetter remembered is Mencken's legendary response upon<br />\nhearing that Coolidge had died: \"How can you tell?\"<br />\nHenry i Louis Mencicen was born the oldest child ofa<br />\ncigar manufacturer in the Baltimore of 1880. Even then<br />\nBaltimore was a city of charm, and its denizens hardly<br />\nneeded the Mayor or the Chamber of Commerce to tell<br />\nthem so. (Mencken tells of a tiny wheat field that prospered near<br />\nMonument Street during the late 1880's. \"Most<br />\nBaltimoreans of that era,\" Mencken wrote,\"took a fierce,<br />\ndefiant pride in the bucolic aspects of their city.\") As a<br />\nboy, Henry and his brother Charlie roamed the alleys and<br />\nvacant lots of West Baltimore, occasionally riding their<br />\npony Frank through the town roadways. Henry's father<br />\nplanned for his eldest son to someday take over the<br />\nfamily's cigar factory, but an errant discovery at the age<br />\nof nine set the course for the rest of Mencken's life. He<br />\nread Huckelberry Finn,;an event he later described as \"the<br />\nmost stupendous of my life.\" He became a bookworm<br />\nand remained one until his graduation (with high honors)<br />\nfrom Baltimore Polytechic Institute. At the age of 16, he<br />\nabandoned his heavy reading \"in favor of life itself.\"<br />\nFor three years Mencken worked,somevvfiat unhappily, at the<br />\ncigar factory. After his father's death in 1899, he began to<br />\nhaunt the city room of the Baltimore Herald, begging<br />\nassignments. Every night for a month, the young aspiring<br />\nwriter pleaded for a job until the city editor of the Herald<br />\nMax Ways, sent him out one winter evening to see how<br />\nthe residents of a rural suburb had survived a blizzard.<br />\nMencken found nothing but the rumor of some stolen<br />\nstable equipment, and filed the following report: \"A<br />\nhorse, a buggy, and several sets of harnass, valued in all at<br />\n,about $250 , were stolen last night from the stable of<br />\nHoward Quinlan, near Kingsville. The county police are at<br />\nwork on the cases but so far no trace of either thieves or<br />\nbooty has been found.\" When the author saw his five-line<br />\narticle in the next morning's paper, his first appearance in<br />\nprint,he was ecstatic.<br />\nOne of the failures of colleges lies in their apparent<br />\nincompetence to select and train a sufficient body of<br />\nteachers. Their choice is commonly limited to<br />\nin<br />\nsecond-raters, for a man who really knows a subject is<br />\nseldom content to spend his lifetime teaching it... There<br /><br />\nare, of course, occasional exceptions to this rule, but they<br />\nare very rare, and none of them are to be found in the<br />\naverage college. The pedagogues there incarcerated are all<br />\ninferior men - men who really know very little about the<br />\nthings they pretend to teach, and are too stupid or too<br />\nindolent to acquire more. Being taught by them is roughly<br />\nlike being dosed in illness by third-year medical students.<br />\n-Notebooks<br /><br />\nWhile many of his peers studied in the shadows of<br />\nivy-covered walls, Mencken was busily climbing the ladder<br />\nof success in the journalistic field. In three years he<br />\nworked his way up to city editor of the Herald,joined<br />\nthe Sun as its Sunday editor at the age of 23, and became<br />\nan editor of the Evening Sun upon its inception in 1910.<br />\nIn 1914 he was appointed . co-editor, with his friend<br />\nGeorge Jean Nathan, of a popular New York Magazine,<br />\nthe Smart Set. Several years later, the two founded the<br />\nAmerican Mercury magazine which became the Bible of<br />\ncollege students and the literary set of the 1920's. These<br />\npublications, the Sunpapers in particular, would serve as<br />\nsounding board for the rest of his career.<br />\nSunpapers critic John Dorsey recently wrote of<br />\nMencken, \"He was against most change and all pretense,<br />\nhypocrisy and sham . He fought prohibition, censorship<br />\nand the attempt to eradicate prostitution, on the grounds<br />\nthat such crusades were useless because human nature<br />\ncannot be altered by government fiat... Mencken<br />\npossessed a sort of dogma of his own which made his<br />\nthinking consistent to the point of rigidity on many social<br />\nissues...Democratic systems, he thought, resulted in<br />\nadvancing the lowest common denominator, to the end<br />\nthat they in turn advanced people of their own kind and<br />\ncreated a country of boobs and Babbits.\" Despite all his<br />\nranting and railing, Mencken maintained a kind of amused<br />\ndetachment form his fellow countrymen, or the<br />\n\"booboisie,\" as he called them.<br /><br />\nPhilosophy consists very largely of one philosopher<br />\narguing that all others are jackasses. He usually proves it,<br />\nand I should add that he also usually proves that he is one<br />\nhimself<br />\n-Notebooks<br />\nMencken was not, and could not be, a philosopher. He<br />\ntook very few things, least of all himself, seriously. He<br />\nconsidered life a comedy, and felt the key to happiness<br />\nlay in the capacity to detect and relish the comic ironies<br />\nof life. \"A man who can laugh, if only at himself,\" he<br /><br />\nIi At1i4413IT<br /><br />\nty I it.14 I?

At the same tiAle, he was a gifted and<br />\nastute literary critic.

The Johns<br />\nHopkins Mencken referred to is the hospital, certainly not<br />\nthe university. Though he had great respect and<br />\nadmiration for Daniel Gilman (in fact, he wondered why<br />\nthe boulevard in front of the campus, namely Charles<br />\nStreet, had not been named after the university's first<br />\npresident), Mencken kept a dim view of the school. In the<br />\nEvening Sun of July 23, 1923, he wrote, \"Today the<br />\nJohns Hopkins is as thoroughly practical and hard-boiled<br />\nan institution as...the Chicago College of Paperhanging. I<br />\nof its Register and find<br />\nglance through the latest issue<br />\ncourses in salesmanship, in casualty insurance, in pistol<br />\nshooting, in business forecasting(whatever that may be),<br />\nin scouting and patrolling and in investments.\" Somewhere<br />\nalong the line, a Hopkins official must have taken note<br />\nfor Mencken's complaints, for none of these courses or<br />\nanything resembling them can be found in recent editions<br />\nof the JHU catalog.<br />\nFor someone who never attended college, Mencken had<br />\nsome very interesting and perceptive theories about it,<br />\nparticularly concerning its true worth to students. I quote<br />\nthe following lines from The Bathtub Hoax (1927) for<br />\ntheir poignancy to anyone currently undergoing the<br />\ntravails of higher education: \"There is error...in the<br />\nassumption that what college has to teach all comes out<br />\nof books, or may be imparted by instructors. This is not<br />\ntrue. What college has to teach, in the main, is simply<br />\nfamiliarity wiht the notions and habits of that vast and<br />\nmysterious organism known as human society...If the<br />\nyoung man at college learns nothing else save the fact that<br />\nmany of the bigwigs of the college world are charlatans,<br />\nand that position and attainments do not necessarily go<br />\ntogether, then he has learned something of the utmost<br />\nvalue.

Mencken replied, he would bow<br />\nand say,\"Gentlemen, I was wrong.\"<br /><br />\nit, if only by the method of the horrible example, then<br />\ngoing to college is worth while.\"<br />\nFew dumber Senators have ever adorned the Upper<br />\nhouse.

Lee<br />\nGoldsborough ofMaryland in<br />\nthe Evening Sun, July 3, 1933<br />\nMencken loved writing about politics and politicians,<br />\njust as a caricaturist enjoys drawing pictures of fat<br />\nmillionaires. The size of the office did not daunt him; he<br />\nchallenged everyone from dog catchers' to Presidents,<br />\nfrom judges to Governors. Americans of the Roaring<br />\nTwenties ate it up, savoring Mencken's bombasts as avidly<br />\nas the author himself. But when the Depression and hard<br />\ntimes hit, the country was in a less good humor. It was<br />\ndifficult to laugh at anything, much less some cocky<br />\njournalist whose ceaseless tirades only served to remind<br />\neveryone how bad things were.<br />\nAfter the 1932 election, Mencken took on FDR,<br />\nlabelling him an aristocratic tmonarch, \"Roosevelt II\". As<br />\nthe President's star rose, the writer's fell. Alistair Cooke<br />\nwrote in 1955,\"The New Deal was Mencken's Waterloo,<br />\nand Roosevelt his Wellington.\"<br /><br />\nAfter his famous coverage of the Scopes Monkey Trial<br />\nof 1925, Mencken became a national celebrity. In 1930<br />\nhe surprised eveiyone when he bid farewell to his<br />\nbachelor's life and married writer Sara Powell Haardt. A<br />\nfact that might, or might not, endear Mencken to Hopkins<br />\nmen is that hit wife was a graduate of Goucher College.<br />\nIronically, ten years before his marriage, Mencken made<br />\nsome not too complimentary comments on Goucher in a<br />\nletter to Dr. Louise Pound: \"Goucher College is...a mere<br />\nteaching<br />\n'female seminary' ,f the usual Southern type,<br />\nMore.<br />\nIt is<br />\nHannah<br />\nof<br />\neditions<br />\nEnglish out of expurgated<br />\nJewesses.<br />\nmainly<br />\nare<br />\nstudents<br />\nrun by Methodists, but the<br /><br />\nMan is of the toughest ofanimated creatures.

All other mammals would succumb<br />\nquickly to what man endures almost without damage.<br />\nConsider, for example, the life of a soldier in the front<br />\nline - or the life ofanyone in Mississippi.<br />\n-Notebooks<br />\n1935 was not the best of times for Mencken. He was<br />\nsteadily losing popularity (a fact he candidly admitted and<br />\ntook in stride), and that year his wife, Sara, died. He<br />\ncontinued writing editorials and articles for the Sun but<br />\nturned most of his energies to the work that, in<br />\nretrospect, his reputation as a great American writer rests<br />\non. Over the course of the next seven years, he produced<br />\nwhich<br />\nthree volumes of memoirs,<br />\ncollectively constitute The Days of H.L. Mencken. The<br />\nDays books reflect Mencken's brilliant command of<br />\nlanguage and his talent as a storyteller of wit and warmth.<br />\nAlong with James Thurber's My Life and Hard Times, The<br />\nDayS<br />\nH.L. Mencken ranks as one of the best humorous<br />\nautobiographies in American literature.<br />\nIf Mencken had never written his numerous newspaper<br />\nand magazine articles, his literary criticism, or his<br />\nmemoirs, he would nonetheless be remembered for his<br />\nscholarly magnum opus, The American Language.<br />\nPublished in 1918, with supplements in 1942 and 1948,<br />\nthe book is the first serious analysis of the evolution and<br />\npatterns of American speech. In 1915, before undertaking<br />\nhis prodigious project, Mencken wrote to a friend,<br />\nexpressing wonder that American scholars seemed to<br />\nscorn the slang of their native country, while most<br />\nEuropean scholars delighted in theirs. After Mencken's<br />\nstudy, tweedy academians from Cambridge to Chicago<br />\nbegan noticing the \u201edistinct poetics of English, American<br />\nstyle.<br />\nDuring the 1940's Mencken, now a man of 60-plus<br />\nyears, was less active than in earlier times. His last hurrah<br />\nwas his coverage of the 1948 Democratic convention. On<br />\nNovember 9 of that same year, Mencken published what<br />\n'as to be his last piece, an article on Baltimore race<br />\nreaitions, which was printed in the Evening Sun. Alistair<br />\nCooke wrote in The Vintage Mencken \"Two weeks later,<br />\nto the day, he had a crebral thrombosis. He was despaired<br />\nof for a time and rallied at one point to say only, 'Bring<br />\non the angels'. But he was tougher than he felt and by<br />\nChristmas his paralysis had vanished and he went home<br />\nagain where...he was devotedly nursed by his brother<br />\nAugust. However, he did not recover from a semantic<br />\naphasia, which left him able to focus images and words<br />\nbut not, alas, into any communicable sense.\" In 1956,<br />\neight years after his stroke, Mencken died.<br />\nThe dying man doe.sn't struggle much and he isn't<br />\nmuch afraid. As his alkalies give out Ile succumbs to a<br />\nblest stupidity. His mind fogs. His will power vanishes. He<br />\nsubmits decently. He scarcely gives a damn.<br />\n\"Exeunt Omnes\"<br />\nRecently, the Enoch Pratt Library commissioned artist<br />\nLarry Wheeler to paint a portrait of Mencken. The<br />\nfinished work shows an elderly gentleman in his whitehaired seventies. He is sitting back in a chair with his legs<br />\ncomfortably crossed. His left hand holds the ubiquitous<br />\ncigar, and his face wears a sad distant look of<br />\nreminiscence. This is the Mencken that will be<br />\nremembered rather than the wisecracking critic of the<br />\nTwenties whose foxy grin and cool gaze seemed to show<br />\nthrough every line of his blasts and bravos. The eyes of<br />\nthe younger Mencken were angrier and more sardonic,<br />\nwhile those of the older Mencken, the white-haired<br />\ngentleman of the Wheeler portrait, revealed \"vain regrets<br />\nand broken hopes,\" and \"the special suffering\" that is the<br />\nwriter's alone.

Patton, Sands of Iwo Jima, and All Quiet on the<br />\nWestern Front are all examples of some of great war<br />\nmovies which have become a part of our culture. But<br />\nBlack and White in Color is different. It is a film whichdeals with war and is yet not a war-movie. To an extent,<br />\nthe battles, the violence and all the horrors of war are<br />\nrepresented, but Black and White in Color is not content<br />\nto sit back and soberly preach to us. Instead it makes war<br />\nseem all the more horrible by showing us its absurdit.<br />\nBlack and White in Color is set in the West African<br />\nsavannah. The date is late 1914 and the story centers on a<br />\nFrench trading village separated from a German garrison<br />\nby a shallow river. Unknown to both sides, World War I<br />\nhas begun so the two colonies spend their time<br />\n\"civilizing\" the black natives -- the Germans through<br />\nmilitary drilling and the French by stealing as much as<br />\nhumanly possibly. The monotony of the situation is<br />\nquickly broken when the French receive some old<br />\nnewspapers which indicate that the war has been in<br />\nprogress for six months. \"Patriotism\" immediately seizes<br /><br />\nDESPERATE LIVING<br />\nMISFITS<br /><br />\nthe spirit of these Frenchmen who plan a sneak attack<br />\n(with a volunteer native army) on the Germans.<br />\nIt is here that the men who at first appear as merely a<br />\ncollection of debauched and venal petit-imperialists reach<br />\nnew levels of idiocy. It is not -enough that the priests<br />\nmake their living by selling worthless religious artif act to<br />\nthe natives or that the military commander orders his<br />\nblack orderly to find him local girls. The ultimate<br />\nabsurdity appears when this same lot of people begin to<br />\nsee themselves as the last defenders of free France. In<br />\nfact, they are so confident in their military (and spiritual)<br />\nsuperiority that they begin the war with a picnic.<br />\n'Black and White in Color as well as being an attack on<br />\nwar, is also a sharp attack on white imperialism and does<br />\nthis with a great deal of wit. By showing us the<br />\npretensiousness and the hypocrisy of the settlers and<br />\njuxtaposing this with the placid, unassuning quality of the<br />\nnatives and the landscape, Director Jean-Jacques Annaud<br />\nshows us that imperialism is not only evil, but is also a<br />\nridiculous manifestation of human vanity.<br />\nIndeed the only character in the filmwho is in any way<br />\ndifferent is transformed by the mini-war from a pariah<br />\ninto absolute and undisputed leader. Hubert Fresnoy, a<br />\nyoung man assigned to study the regional geography, is<br />\nthe sole person to warn against launching an attack and is<br />\nridiculed for it. However, it is he who emerges as the sole<br />\ncompetent man after the natives fighting for the French are<br />\ncompletely routed by the bettu-trained German natives.<br />\nIt is at this point that the film begins to deal with the<br />\nissue of leadership. Fresnoy gathers the loose strands after<br />\nthe defeat and begins to assume full authority. We see in<br />\nhim as a man who has a justified sense of his own<br />\nsuperiority, but who also is impeccably polite. In fact,<br />\nFresnoy becomes so aloof that we can see a kind of<br />\n\"Palace Guard\" evolving as he surrounds himself with a<br />\nnative staff trained in making sure Fresnoy is left alone.<br />\nBlack and White in Color received an Oscar as the Best<br />\nForeign-Film of the year in 1977, and it deserves its<br />\nrecognition. It explores weighty topics without being<br />\noverly weighty, and it is precisely because of this that the<br />\neffects on the viewer are extremely profound. We are<br />\nallowed to see for ourselves the contradictions and<br />\nparadoxes, and the final scene after the end of the war is<br />\nso beautifully absurd as to be a successful culmination of<br />\nall that has gone on before.<br /><br />\nPAUL KLEE<br /><br />\nptertaiimept<br /><br />\nPINK FLAMINGOS<br /><br />\nHowever, he is also irresolute, tired, and brooding. He<br />\ncheers up when his son Captain Apollo (Richard Hatch)<br />\ntells him in effect that if he can't stand the heat, he<br />\nshould get out of the star system. Apollo and Lieutenant<br />\nStarbuck (Dick Benedict) are on the other hand, an<br />\ninterstellar Starsky and Hutch. They are gamblers and<br />\nwomanizers, but they can wield their laser guns just as<br />\neffectively as Matt Dillon or Joe Mannix could use their<br />\nlittle friends.<br />\nThe most noticeable feature of BG are the special<br />\neffects, done by Star Wars' John Dykstra Once again, we<br /><br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\n\u2022<br />\nBattlestar Galactica (Sundays, ABC, 8:00) is set in<br />\nneither New York, Los Angeles, nor aboard a homy<br />\nairliner. It was not filmed before a live studio audience or<br />\na laugh track. It is not an imitation of 40 other shows.<br />\nFinally, because deep space is a tad too cold for bikinis,<br />\nBG does not exploit the American fixation with jiggling<br />\nmammaries. For these reasons alone, Battlestar Galactica; is,<br />\nbetter than most of today's TV fare-.<br />\nFor those who have been stranded on Walton's<br />\nMountain, The Love Boat, Moon Base Alpha,or the Little<br />\nHouse on the High Veldt for the past two months and not<br />\nread any of the countless reviews, the show focuses on the<br />\nGiVatt Trek of the last surviving group of humans. They<br />\nare the last because the evil Cylons, bully boy super<br />\nrobots, have tricked mankind into signing a peace treaty<br />\nending 7000 years of war. Instead, the Cylons wreck all<br />\nthe planets, which are colonies of the ancient mother<br />\ncivilization Kobol and its father civilization named<br />\nFortran, as well as all of the battlestars (space battleships)<br />\nexcept Galactica. The survivors decide to head for the<br />\nmost distant colony on a planed appropriately named<br />\nEarth. This Chariots of the Gods theme runs throughout<br />\nthe series. Next week, we see the characters on Kobol.<br />\nThe scpne was shot at the Egyptian Pyramids. The<br />\nhelmets of the space warriors even resemble striped<br />\nEgyptian headdresses.<br />\nGalactica has three main characters.

They are showing two John<br />\nWaters films, Pink Flamingos and Desperate Living<br />\nwhich star the likes of Divine and Edy the Egg<br />\nLady. These movies, filmed in Baltimore, are<br />\nadvertised as \"an exercise in bad taste.\" They are<br />\nso profoundly decadent that the viewer doesn't<br />\nknow whether to intelligently criticize the films as<br />\na statement on today's society, or just be grossed<br />\nout. The experience of a John Waters film is<br />\nunrivalled in cinema, and should not be passed<br />\nup-at least the first time.<br /><br />\nWINSLOW HOMER<br /><br />\nrHE<br /><br />\nDEADLINES<br /><br />\nMAN WHO WOULD BE KING<br />\nBATTLESTAR GALACTICA<br /><br />\nBLACK AND WHITE IN COLOR<br /><br />\n`Galactica'<br />\nGreat Fantasy<br />\nFor Sunday<br /><br />\nDivine?<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nQ.<br /><br />\n\u2022<br />\nTelorisiop<br />\nsee the stunning space dogfights, awesome hardware, and<br />\nlush interiors. Inevitably, such artistry suffers on a small<br />\nscreen. Who can forget how the Clavius moonbase in the<br />\ntelevised 2001: A Space Odyssey (special effects by Doug<br />\nTrumbull) looked like a slightly classier version of Moon<br />\nEtase Alpha in Trumbull's chintzy Space:1999. So, don't<br />\nexpect to be too everwhelmed by Galactica's magic.<br /><br />\nSome snobs will undoubtedly say thatt BG's plot and<br />\ncharacters are too unrealistic and pedestrian. However,<br />\nany work should really only be measured against the<br />\nideal of its genre. Galactica is a space fantasy, by<br />\ndefinition unreal. Story lines are supposed to be fast<br />\npaced, interesting, uncontroversial, and good should win<br />\nover evil. Viewers usually do not fantasize heroes who are<br />\ndisagreable pot smoking zit-faced grunts who either frag<br />\ntheir officers or get hit by friendly fire. In fantasy, there<br />\nshould be characters that can be either hated or liked, not<br />\nones who are complex, fickle or weak. Turn to PBS for<br />\nthose. Thus, Adama is probably the most developed<br />\ncharacter in the series. Battlestar Galactica measures up<br />\nfar more favorably to Star Wars than does the detective<br />\nfantasy Charlie's Angels against those utterly wonderful<br />\nJames Bond films.<br />\nFinally, some party poopers, even to the point of<br />\nlitigation, claim that BG is a rip off of Star Wars. This is<br />\nsilly. Sure, the Cylons do look like Darth Vader's merry<br />\nmen, and there are similar plot sequences and characters,<br />\nThese would occur in any competent space fantasy done<br />\nnowadays. No reference is made to specific characters or<br />\nevents in the movie. One never sees R2D2 or C3P0, and<br />\nthere is nothing even similar to the Force. In fact,<br />\neveryone on Galactica seems to be athiest. Dykstra did<br />\nwork for both films, and he can hardly be blamed if the<br />\nmotifs he uses to induce fantasy are similar. They are a<br />\npart of his creative repertoire, not that of a movie studio<br />\nwho would not be rolling in money if Dykstra had not<br />\nsigned on. Galactica will not steal money from Star Wars<br />\nand its sequels. Not only are there differences between<br />\nthe detached effect of the small screen and the total<br />\ninvolvement created by the large one, but the film and its<br />\ncharacters have their own powerful mystique.<br />\nAnalogously, that is why 2001 will be remembered and<br />\nSilent Running (also done by Trumbull) will be forgotten.<br />\nBy all means, see Battlestar Galactica. It's well done<br />\nhonest escapist fun that puts on no pretensions, but is still<br />\ninoffensive. It's perfect for a Sunday evening before<br />\nanother mind eroding week of classes and working on<br />\nNews-Letter articles.

The content of the lyrics<br />\nfrom many recent releases is autobiographical, concerning<br />\nitself with questions of personal survival and creativity.<br />\nWhereas once, rock was a rather simplistic idiom with<br />\nhardly any concerns except to perform, many artists who<br />\nhave been around for countless years have suddenly<br />\nbecome aware of age and image, and have become worried<br />\nabout what comes next. One of the best examples of this<br />\nfear is Jethro Tull's album of two years ago, Too Old to<br />\nRock and Roll, Too Young to Die- if a rock artist<br />\ncannot boogie forever and is not ready to die, what<br />\nexactly is this intemediary state between music and death.<br />\nUnlike other artists, the physicality of rock and roll<br />\nmakes it virtually impossible for a rock musician to<br />\ncontinue past a certain age. Unless the person is Satchel<br />\nPaige, and the predicament of the rock musician is not<br />\nunlike that of.an athlete. After a certain number of years,<br />\nthe timing is off, the .fast ball is slow and the arm is weak<br />\nand painful; and it would seem impossible for Pete<br />\nTownshend to leap around and for Mick Jagger to swagger<br />\nhis hips forever. For all rock artists, it seems that they will<br />\neventually reach a point where they cannot go on<br />\nanymore and they must \"retire\". These autobiographical<br />\nquestions have been explored most recently on albums by<br />\nthe Kinks and the Strawbs, two mainstays of British rock.<br />\nThe Kinks have been around since the mid-Sixties, and<br />\nover the years, they have had their share of hits. Their<br />\nlater albums have not been geared towards this<br />\ncommercial success, and they have managed to maintain<br />\nonly a cult following. These albums have consisted of<br />\ntedious and uninspired self-explorations which is basically<br />\na rehashing of their older material. The new album<br />\nMisfits, though, is an exploration into these questions of<br />\nsurvival, answers to which the Kinks never before<br />\npursued. The lyrics express the struggle to retain their<br />\nstatus and dignity in a profession that is continually<br />\nshifting its views and values. \"Rock and Roll Fantasy\" is<br />\none of the most perceptive song compositions on the<br />\nIC<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\nz<br /><br />\nII<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nalbum. It moans the despair of living in the fantasy world<br />\nof rock and roll, and the fear and uncertainty of what lies<br />\nahead in \"reality\". Misfits is a good album musically<br />\nalthough it should not change the cult status of the Kinks.<br />\nIt does represent, though, a clear and precise investigation<br />\ninto the,questions of being a rock artist and growing old,<br />\nand eventual retirement in a way that few<br />\nautobiographical albums have been able to do.<br />\nThe Strawbs new album Deadlines is autobiographical<br />\nfrom a different point of view. They are not so much<br />\nconcerned with the pains of growing old, as when the<br />\npopularity and creativity sputters so much that the band<br />\nmust consider whether it is even worthwhile to continue.<br />\nOn this album, the Strawbs have been able to stand back<br />\nand objectively view their history. Within the framework<br />\nof lyrics about false or unrequited love and journeys of<br />\nself-discovery which abound on earlier albums, the<br />\nStrawbs have created lyrical allegories that express their<br />\nobservations about the group at this juncture in time. In<br />\ndoing so, they have also created one of their finest albums<br />\never.<br />\nThe predicament of the Strawbs is not unlike the<br />\nKinks. The Strawbs have been rather prolific over the past<br />\nfew years, but their albums have passed - relatively<br />\nunnoticed. Their music departed from the captivating<br />\ncompositions that covered a range from soft love songs to<br />\nacerbic songs of protest. The most recent albums were<br />\nself-indulgent exercises in which there was no<br />\ncommunication between the artists and the listener. The<br />\nmusical and the lyrical ideas became so muddled in the<br />\nStrawbs' need for personal expression that these ideas<br />\nwere too obscure to be comprehended. The cover of<br />\nDeadlines is a reporter trying to beat a deadline, but he is<br />\nstuck inside a telephone booth that is filled with water.<br />\nThis is probably the way the Strawbs felt -- they were<br />\nunable to communicate their ideas - thus the concept of<br />\nthe new album is to express these submerged feelings as<br />\nthey try to excape from the booth. They achieve this goal<br />\nextremely well in a variety of compositions which express<br />\n, their inablility to return to their best days in the early<br />\n'X<br /><br />\nFRESHMEN<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\nir<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nlEX<br /><br />\nSeventies (No Return), feeling that they have betrayed<br />\ntheir fans (Sealed With A Traitor's Kiss), their feeling that<br />\nthis album is their last chance for survival (The Last<br />\nResort) and even a desire to begin again pursuing new<br />\ngoals (New Beginnings). The music is the best the Strawbs<br />\nhave recorded in years, and the .autobiographical concept<br />\nof the album is honest, authentic and insightful into the<br />\nfeelings of the band members at this point in their musical<br />\ncareers.<br />\nRock and roll exploded into American culture like a<br />\nFrankenstein, formless and without a history, possessing<br />\nonly raw, untamed energy. People like Buddy Holly, Bill<br />\nHaley, Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendrix (along with<br />\ncountless others) were totally uninhibited in their modes<br />\nof expression because there was no past to restrict them.<br />\nBut more than a generation has passed since then, and<br />\nrock and roll has taken on many forms that have become<br />\nthe standards of the art. Most of the innovators are dead,<br />\nand the ability to survive depends on how well the artist<br />\nadheres to these conventions. The standards are well set,<br />\nand it would be difficult to revolutionize them. Punk<br />\nrock, New Wave, Disco and others are fads that will not<br />\nchange the face of rock music, and in their own ways are<br />\nme rely extrapolations of conventions already well<br />\nmolded. The music of the Kinks and the Strawbs<br />\nrepresent their personal interpretations of these<br />\nconventions, and their success of failure as a band<br />\ndepends on how well listeners receive their individual<br />\nstatements. Therefore when rock artists become old and<br />\ntheir statements become obscure and misunderstood, they<br />\nmust contemplate retirement. They must give way to<br />\nyounger musicians who can still generate the original raw<br />\nenergy, and who can reinterpret the conventions of rock,<br />\ncreating a different (though not always new) statement.<br />\nThe Kinks and the Strawbs probably felt age catching up<br />\nwith them, and they were able to communicate with only<br />\na few listeners, so they were forced to consider the end of<br />\ntheir musical careers. Ironically, on their autobiographical<br />\nalbums, these two bands have recorded some of their<br />\nmost original statements in a long time.<br />\n.11CILIL<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nIt<br /><br />\n1MIL<br /><br />\nZ.<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nIC<br /><br />\nIT'S NOT TOO LATE!<br /><br />\nCONSIDER TAKING ARMY ROTC AT JOHNS HOPKINS<br />\nalmoMMIMEMO<br /><br />\nas/<br /><br />\nNO OBLIGATION FIRST TWO YEARS<br />\n1 BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE FOR AN<br />\n/<br />\nARMY SCHOLARSHIP<br />\n1/LAST TWO YEARS OF PROGRAM<br />\nRECEIVE $2,500<br />\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION VISIT ROOM 200, MILITARY SCIENCE<br />\nBLDG (Behind the gym)or CALL CAPTAIN DON MILLER 338-7474 /7475<br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nz<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nX<br /><br />\nPAGE 16 / SEPTEMBER 22, 1978<br /><br />\nThe New Ambrosia<br />\nSiOecoalk Baccet<br /><br />\n\"You think only God<br />\ncan make a tree?<br />\nTry coming up<br />\nwith a mackerel.\"<br /><br />\n**<br /><br />\n(in the Rathskeller)<br /><br />\n----<br /><br />\n-1V1ENLI-<br /><br />\nMonOag, 9/25<br /><br />\nCaRoeo Roast Beer<br />\n1<br />\n(aa jas 0116 grzaog), .<br /><br />\nTaesOag,9/26<br /><br />\nPizza Siciliana<br /><br />\nSenior Class<br /><br />\nThaaseiag, 9/2w<br /><br />\nDeli (pastaarni,<br /><br />\ncoane-O beep, anO baabeque bear)<br />\nFaiOag, 9/29<br /><br />\nCaRoeb Roast Bear<br />\n(au jas anO gu_aog)<br /><br />\nSeaving Larch<br />\n11:30 to 2:30 p.m_<br />\nHappy Birthday<br /><br />\nKathy<br /><br />\nTERI GARR \u2022 DONALD PLEASENCE<br /><br />\nFilm Series<br />\npresents...<br />\nCAMREINER<br /><br />\n(peppeaoni,sausage,anO rnashaoorrA<br />\nc .<br />\nWe-OnesOag, 9/27 Crepes<br />\n1<br /><br />\nGEORGE BURNS \u2022 JOHN DENVER \u2022<br /><br />\nFriday &amp; Saturday<br />\nSeptember 22 &amp; 23<br />\n7, 9 &amp;11 pm<br /><br />\nAdmission-81.00<br />\nSeniors-8 .75<br />\nShaffer 3<br /><br />\nSpecial Showing<br />\nSunday, September 24<br />\n8 &amp; 10 pm<br />\nShaffer 3<br /><br />\nP. .1!<br /><br />\n*DOUBLE FEATURE * DOUBLE FEATURE *<br />\n\"BLACK<br />\nCOLOR\" /<br /><br />\nFRIDAY<br />\nSEPTEMBER 22<br />\n7:30 &amp; 11:30<br />\nSATURDAY<br />\nSEPTEMBER 23<br />\n9:45<br /><br />\nACADEMY<br />\nAWARD<br />\nWINNER<br />\nBest<br />\nForeign<br />\nFilm of<br />\nThe Year<br /><br />\nSHRIVER HALL * JOHNS HOPKINS * HOMEWOOD * $1 ADMISSION<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE,1 7<br /><br />\nWho Needs The<br />\nSOBs Anyway???<br />\n(CPS)\u2014\"Student government was a joke. It had become<br />\nan ineffective waste of money,\" explained David Haug, a<br />\nUniversity of Texas(UT)junior who heads the Coalition<br />\nto Retire Aspiring Politicos (CRAP). \"So our motto<br />\nbecame 'We pay $45,000 for nothing- we can get nothing<br />\nfor less than that'. And we were succesful.\"<br />\nThe \"we\" Haug is referring to is the 2644 UT students<br />\nwho voted to abolish UT's student government in a<br />\nreferendum last month. It was a close vote; 2458 students<br />\nopposed to complete abolition. But Haug feels the bulk of<br />\nthe student sentiment favored retiring a structure many<br />\nfelt was an \"albatross.\"<br />\nAnd he may, in the process, have touched a national<br />\nnerve as well. Haug has gotten letters and phone calls<br />\nfrom a number of other schools since leading the UT<br />\ncommittee.<br />\nUT's student association (SA) was beset with problems<br />\ncommon to many student governments. It was powerless,<br />\nHaug asserts, with most of its money it directly controlled<br />\ngoing for salaries. It was non-representative. This year UT<br />\nvoter turnout was the lowest in recent history, a paltry<br />\nseven percent. And many of those elected were \"political<br />\nhacks,\" Haug charges.<br />\n\"What we elect each year are the best politicians, who<br />\nthink they can sit around, pass resolutions and change the<br />\nworld. When that doesn't happen, they would either stop<br />\ncoming to meetings or retain all illusions of power.\"<br />\nMany agreed with Haug's view of UTSA's problems,<br />\nbut not everyone concurred that abolition was the<br />\nanswer. Said SA vice-president Mark Luzzatto, \"I don't<br />\nfeel people are willing to face the fact that it's not SA's<br />\nstructure at fault. If people don't get off their goddam<br />\nasses and elect effective leaders they will always have<br />\nthese problems.\"<br />\nSome felt that abolishing a structure without having<br />\nanother to take its place would leave SA open to even<br />\nmore administrative control, or that \"whatever took its<br />\nplace would have different people with different titlesbut<br />\nthe same problems,\" as one student theorized in an<br />\neditorial.<br />\nBut CRAP supporters believed that some kind of<br /><br />\n\u2022 Klee, Homer<br />\nExhibitions<br />\nAt Museum<br /><br />\nArt<br /><br />\nPublic Duel (1932) by Paul Klee<br />\n\"cooling off period\" is necessary to determine what is<br />\nreally needed and wanted. Haug is confident that some<br />\nplan will rise from the ashes. Various proposals have<br />\nalready surfaced, ranging from a nine-member student<br />\nboard of regents to a co-ordinator function for the<br />\nassociation, with student groups lobbying in their own<br />\ninterests.<br />\nHaug feels students are ready for something completely<br />\ndifferent. He said the abolition action was predictable as<br />\nlong as two years ago when a landslide victory was won<br />\nby a duo running on an \"Arts and Sausages\" campaign.<br />\n\"They were completely non-sensical.

The<br />\nexhibition consists of sixty-seven of Klee's finest works,<br />\nincluding oils, water -colors, gouaches, prints and<br />\ndrawings. One of the major artists of the early part of the<br />\ntwentieth century, Klee has been termed outside of<br />\nPicasso, probably more imaginative and varied in his<br />\ntechnique and style than any oCier artist in the twentieth<br />\ncentury.<br />\nPaul Klee was one of this century's most prolific,<br />\ncomplex and subtle artists. His average yearly production<br />\nwas between 250 and 300 works, and over his career he<br />\nhas recorded nearly 9000 works. Throughout his life, Klee<br />\nexplored materials and techniques, merging one medium<br />\nand method into another. As a young artist he was<br />\nprimarily a illustrator/draftsman, very linear in his<br />\norientation. However, upon returning from a short trip to<br />\nNorth Africa in 1914, he wrote in his diary, \"Color<br />\npossesses me...color and I are one.\" From that point on,<br />\nKlee emerges as colorist, producing works such as Runner<br />\nat the Goal (1921), Red Balloon (1922) and In the<br />\nCurrent Six Thresholds (1929), all included in this<br />\nexhibition.<br />\nIn addition, there is an exhibition of watercolors,<br />\nengravings and drawing by the American artist Winslow<br />\nHomer, continuing through November 5. The exhibition<br />\nexplored Homer's career as an illustrator before and after<br />\nhe turned to oil pointing. Homer's illustrations are<br />\ncarefully composed, decidedly linear works marked by<br />\nstrong contrasts between light and dark. For subject<br />\nmatter, he consistently selected outdoor scenes of both<br />\nfashionable and rural life, and also produced a number of<br />\nworks based on sketches made during numerous trips to<br />\nthe Virginia front during the Civil War.<br /><br />\nRATHAPPENINGS<br />\nTonight, \\<br />\nFriday<br /><br />\nSaturday<br />\nNight<br />\nSU PERDISCO<br /><br />\nLIVE DISCO<br />\nWITH<br />\nGRAND<br />\nJUNCTION<br /><br />\nFRIED CHICKEN PLATTERS<br />\nLEG or BREAST $1.29<br />\nWITH DELICIOUS WESTERN FRIES<br /><br />\nALWAYS HOT N.Y.
