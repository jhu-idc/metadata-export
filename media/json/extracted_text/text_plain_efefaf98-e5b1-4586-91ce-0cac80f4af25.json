If<br />\na worthy object is always deserving of success, then one which has been rendered possible only by such a long and arduous campaign as the \"Season Ticket Plan\" called<br />\nfor, is deserving of a double portion of success. We are informed by the committee<br />\nthat the sale of tickets, both to students and<br />\nDoubtless those<br />\nalumni, has been large.<br />\nwho intend to purchase, but have not thus<br />\nfar found it convenient to do so, will secure their tickets shortly. Some regulations<br />\nwith regard to the tickets appear not to<br />\nhave been generally understood: first, tickets are transferable, and will admit one person, whether it be the owner or someone else,<br />\nto each game; second, although tickets may<br />\nbe sold only to members of the faculty, students and alumni, yet such persons may buy<br />\nmore than one if they desire.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nbe highly gratifying to the faculty. As to<br />\nthe expediency of the step, our own opinion<br />\nis fixed. We firmly believe that the introduction of the \"honor system\" would not<br />\nonly add to the reputation of the undergraduate department, and to the general esteem<br />\nin which its students are held, but also that<br />\nthe moral effect produced on the mind of the<br />\nindividual student by such a responsibility<br />\nwould be a beneficial one. We are thoroughly in favor of the step.

A BRIDE, A GROOM, AND A GRAIN OF RICE.<br />\nER head barely reached a hove the<br />\nback of the plush-covered seat in<br />\nfront of me, over the back of which<br />\na few stray wisps of golden-brown hair had<br />\nwandered in a manner as tantalizing as it<br />\nwas delightful. His head, as far away from<br />\nthe golden-brown one as possible, was higher, larger, and darker; and would have been<br />\nentirely uninteresting but for one circumstance\u2014in the very crown there was perched<br />\na grain of rice. Even if there had been no<br />\ntell-tale grain of rice, I think I should soon<br />\nhave discovered their secret. As it was, I<br />\ngave up at once all thought of the monotonous view along the road to Washington, and<br />\nset out to make a few observations in a new<br />\nfield\u2014to-wit, what it is like to be on a honeymoon.<br />\nA glance told me the couple were gentlefolk; from Philadelphia, I soon concluded.<br />\nAt least, she spoke of the railroad \"cor,\"<br />\nand his hat in the rack above showed a<br />\nPhiladelphia shop-mark. There was an indefinable something about the back of the<br />\nbride's head, the only part of her I could<br />\nsee, which satisfied me that she was pretty;<br />\nand when, after a time, I heard her voice,<br />\nI felt sure she was charming as well. Of<br />\nthe groom I had a slightly better view The<br />\nclean-shaven profile, and the broad, athleticlooking shoulders, were those of the average<br />\nyoung American professional man of twentysix or seven. It was a strong, honest face,<br />\nthough, and gave one the impression that its<br />\nowner could be depended upon. I liked the<br />\npair immediately.<br />\nThey were an eminently proper young<br />\ncouple. There was nothing \"spoony\" or sentimental in their deportment. On the other<br />\nhand, they were so preternaturally sedate<br />\nand solemn, that a suspicion, which soon<br />\ngrew to eonviction, took root in my mind.<br />\nThe sly young rogues were actually trying<br />\n\u2014upon a preconcerted plan, I doubted not\u2014<br />\nto pass themselves off as a grave and experienced married pair, whose honeymoon had<br />\ntaken place so long before that they had al.<br />\n<br />\nH<br />\n<br />\nmost forgotten they had ever had one. They<br />\nshould have known the thing was impossible.<br />\nEven the boy that sells chewing-gum,<br />\noranges, and stale pop-corn winked knowingly at the porter as he passed them. But<br />\nthey did not know it; so the matron of nineteen, and the middle-aged married man of<br />\ntwenty-six, sat uncomfortably upright at extreme ends of their seat, and looked fixedly<br />\nthe one out of the window and the other at<br />\na magazine. And all the time that mischievous little grain of rice danced gleefully<br />\nabout with every movement of the car, and<br />\ntold the whole story to everyone who would<br />\npause to look at it.<br />\nSuch a condition of things is interesting<br />\nenough at the discovery; but a continuance<br />\nof it soon becomes monotonous.<br />\nHence,<br />\nwhen the train slowed up at Laurel, I was<br />\nglad to see her turn and bend over the magazine he was holding. It was opened, I<br />\nhad previously noticed, to a reproduction of<br />\none of Flagg's or Gibson's heads.<br />\n\"I think she's hideous,\" she said, somewhat spitefully, as she leaned back again.<br />\nHe smiled. \"I was only thinking,\" said<br />\nhe, \"how much prettier someone else's dimples are.\"<br />\n\"Someone else's\" dimples were now very<br />\npretty indeed. He gazed at her for a moment (no longer like a middle-aged married man), and then made what seemed to<br />\nme to be quite an irrevelant statement. \"I<br />\nthink,\" said he, slowly, \"that the English<br />\nrailway coach is much preferable to the<br />\nAmerican style.\" It must have meant something, however, for even the back of her<br />\nneck grew pink.<br />\nAn instant later, though, she became redder still, and her expression changed from<br />\none of\u2014well, of staid, conjugal affection\u2014<br />\nto one of almost ferocious hatred, as her<br />\neye fell upon that poor little grain of rice.<br />\nCautiously, yet venomously, she stretched<br />\nforth her hand, and gathered in the pale<br />\nlittle tell-tale.<br />\nAs she did so she east a<br />\nsearching glance behind, to see if anyone<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nhad observed her action.

A<br />\nyoung man in the Y. M. C. A. showed me<br />\na list and gave me some advice about different places. When I offered to pay him he<br />\nrefused to accept anything, but asked me instead to join the Y. M. C. A. I thought I<br />\nmight as well take in everything, so I joined;<br />\nthe next day I found in my box a bill for<br />\ndues\u2014payable in advance. The day after,<br />\nas I was walking through the basement,<br />\nthree fellows came up to me and asked me<br />\nto go with them. This seemed rather rude<br />\nto me, because I had not been introduced<br />\nto them, and I did not know what they<br />\nwanted to do, but they were very cordial and<br />\ntook me arm in arm, so I thought it would<br />\nbe all right. When we came to a car line<br />\none of them stooped down and undid my<br />\nshoe. When a car came along he stopped<br />\nit and told me to put my foot on the step<br />\nand tie it\u2014that is, the shoe. The car was<br />\ngoing in my direction so I just got in and<br />\nsat down\u2014next to a nice-looking gentleman<br />\nwith side whiskers\u2014I thought I had seen<br />\nhim in the hall when I took my examinations.<br />\nThe car went off and the fellows seemed<br />\nrather offended that I did not say good-bye<br />\nto them.

It occupies only<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsmall part of one's time and yet is the most<br />\ninteresting and important course in the University.

This is a little more costly than<br />\nthe dances last year, but it has been found<br />\nthat dances cannot be conducted as University dances should be for less than this<br />\namount. The regulation in regard to paying in advance was adopted in order to insure the members of the committee from personal loss.<br />\nThe committee in charge consists of Barton, Chairman; Mengel, Secretary; and<br />\nSioussat, Treasurer, all of the Class of 1906;<br />\nand Hynson and Iglehart from the Junior<br />\nClass. A Freshman will be added to the<br />\ncommittee before the first dance. This posi-<br />\n<br />\ntion is a competitive one, and will be given<br />\nto the Freshman who secures the largest<br />\nnumber of subscribers out of his own class.<br />\nThe members of the committee, as it now<br />\nstands, are the Junior and Freshmen members of the committee which served last year.<br />\nThe idea of the committee in keeping themselves in office another year was that the<br />\nUniversity might have the benefit of their<br />\ninitial experience in organizing the Club.<br />\nLater in the year some competitive scheme<br />\nwill be devised by which new blood may be<br />\ninfused.<br />\nLast year, as the older students know, witnessed the debut of the Cotillon Club. Previous to last year, there had always been<br />\nHopkins dances, but they were not according to any regular mode. It was early in<br />\nthe year determined to try to have a series<br />\nof dances which would correspond to the<br />\nAssembly dances of other colleges and universities. The dances were a success last<br />\nyear, although there was much room for<br />\nimprovement. This year the committee proposed to take advantage of its past experience and errors, and, with the support of<br />\nthe student body, give a far better series<br />\nof dances.<br />\nIn every other college or university, the<br />\nAssembly dances are events which the undergraduate looks forward to, and the alumni<br />\nlooks back upon, with keen delight. In the<br />\nuse of McCoy Hall, Hopkins has an advantage ever many similar institutions, and we<br />\nought to make the most of it.<br />\nThe following dates have been selected<br />\nfor the dances, all of which are subject to<br />\nchange, however, if they conflict with important events, so that members of teams and<br />\nclubs need have no hesitation in \"signing<br />\nup\" for their season tickets:\u2014<br />\nNovember 25;<br />\nJanuary 12, '1906;<br />\nFebruary 23, 1906.<br />\nIn conclusion, the committee desires to<br />\nstate that its sole idea is to perpetuate attractive and enjoyable University dances,<br />\nand as it desires to be absolutely fair to all,<br />\nwill be glad to receive any suggestions or<br />\nadvice which will help along the good work.<br />\nC. K. MENGEL, '06.<br />\n<br />\n\f8<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nHOPKINS, 11; DELAWARE, 0.<br />\nUnlike last year, Hopkins opened this season last Saturday with a victory. The team<br />\nfrom Delaware played a fast game but was<br />\nnever dangerous except for one period in the<br />\nsecond half. From the first kick-off the boys<br />\nin Black and Blue showed their superiority,<br />\nand forced the ball by steady gains to the<br />\nfive-yard line, only to lose it on a fumble.<br />\nSoon after this, Worthington was sent over<br />\nthe line for the first touchdown and Bayless<br />\nkicked an easy goal. This ended the scoring in the first half.<br />\nIn the second half Delaware braced up<br />\nand, helped by fumbling on the part of the<br />\nHopkins boys, for some time held their own.<br />\nBut the strain told on them and Hopkins<br />\nsoon added another touchdown to the score.<br />\nFrom this time on Hopkins had things ,its<br />\nown way and time was called with Hopkins<br />\nin possession of the ball on Delaware's fiveyard line.<br />\nTaking the work of the Hopkins team as<br />\na whole, there was a notable lack of team<br />\nwork and formation. This can be accounted<br />\nfor, no doubt, by the lack of practice owing<br />\nto the earliness of the season. Individually<br />\nthe team showed up well, and this individual<br />\nability will count for a great deal when pracOne<br />\ntice has developed the team-work.<br />\nweakness seemed apparent and that was at<br />\nthe ends. On defense the men seemed to<br />\nplay in too close and allowed the opposing<br />\nbacks to circle the ends for several gains.<br />\nThe team this year, if Saturday's lineup can be taken as a sample, will probably<br />\n<br />\nbe lighter than it was last season. Only five<br />\nof last year's team played against Delaware,<br />\nand two of these were substitutes last year.<br />\nOne pleasing thing was remarked, and that<br />\nis that six of the men who were in the game<br />\nwere undergraduates. Some new men were<br />\nseen on the team who seemed to be all that<br />\ncould be desired. Among these, Moss, of the<br />\nMedical School, and Bayless, a special student, appeared to be the most efficient. Moss<br />\nweighs two hundred pounds or more, and<br />\nhandled his weight well at right guard. Hass'<br />\nanother \"Med.\" played well and held down<br />\nright tackle in good style.<br />\nMoss and Preble seem to have their positions secure for this season, but the final<br />\nmake up of the line positions will depend<br />\nupon whether the men of last year's team<br />\nwho are still in the University come out or<br />\nnot.<br />\nIn the back field the team seems pretty<br />\nwell supplied. Iglehart did well last Saturday at quarter-back, and is heavier than<br />\nhe was last season. As \"Sandy\" Randall is<br />\nstill in the University, the quarter-back position seems to be taken care of. Worthington,<br />\nBayless and Campbell are a trio which is<br />\nhard to beat for ground gaining. They will<br />\nno doubt fill the back positions for the rest<br />\nof the season.<br />\nThe rooters turned out in fair numbers for<br />\nthe first game, and were led by that inspiring Chief Rooter,\"Bob\" Griswold, who filled<br />\nhis conspicuous position as gracefully as he<br />\nwas wont to do last year.<br />\nThe next game will be Saturday, Oct. 21,<br />\n.in Washington, and our team will meet its<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nold rivals, G-e-o-r-g-e George\u2014Washington!<br />\nWashington!!

C.<br />\nTime of halves--!() minutes.<br />\n<br />\nCLASS FOOTBALL.<br />\nSometime in the recent past the Freshmen<br />\nmet in Room 11, under the wing of Mother<br />\nGreene, and elected a temporary captain for<br />\ntheir prospective football team. Mr. Ridgely was chosen for this position and no doubt<br />\nwill fill it ably.<br />\nThis election, although it came early in<br />\nthe season, brings up a question as to what<br />\nwill be the relative merits of the two teams,<br />\nand has already started members of both<br />\nclasses figuring out dope sheets showing how<br />\ntheir class will wipe the other one off the<br />\nfield.<br />\nForetelling the nature of this contest is<br />\ndifficult, because of the unknown quality of<br />\nthe Freshman class. The prophet can get<br />\na very good idea of the Junior eleven because he has seen the team at practice last<br />\nseason, and in actual games where their quality was proved. But with the Freshman<br />\nclass the only chances he has had to see the<br />\nabilities of any prospective members of the<br />\n1908 eleven displayed, has been in the cage<br />\nwhen the aforesaid members were not exactly in football attire.<br />\nThe Junior team has been very fortunate<br />\nin not losing many of its important men. In<br />\nfact, the only man whose loss will be felt<br />\nis Hartmann. The team of '07 also loses<br />\nPease, who will play for '08 this year, but<br />\nwhose loss is partly, if not wholly made up<br />\n<br />\n9<br />\n<br />\nby the fact that MaeSherry, who was disabled with a broken leg last year, is back<br />\nagain better than ever. The members of<br />\nthe Junior team back this year are Raleigh,<br />\nBlanck, Stone, Harris, Lynch, Iglehart,<br />\nStewart, MaeSherry, Branham, \"Werkshagen,<br />\nTough, Padgett and Hunter. On paper, this<br />\nlooks like a very good nucleus, as the men<br />\nare in many cases stronger and heavier than<br />\nthey were a year ago.<br />\nOf the Freshman class, no definite statement can be made, but those men who have<br />\ndistinguished themselves in preparatory<br />\nschools may be mentioned here.<br />\nAmong<br />\nthese are Ridgely, Pease, Armstrong, Abel,<br />\nMichael, Tilghman, Strauss, Chesney and<br />\nBreyer. These, howeiTer, are not all the men<br />\nin the class, and much football material will<br />\nno doubt be developed from the rest of the<br />\nclass. The Freshman team from all accounts<br />\nshould be very heavy this year.<br />\nOn the whole, the coming contest looks as<br />\nif it should be close, and no doubt will furnish much sport for the spectators.<br />\nThe following suggestion seems to be a<br />\ngood one. It has been suggested that the<br />\nmembers of both classes study very closely<br />\nthe tactics of football by purchasing season<br />\ntickets and coming out to see the 'Varsity<br />\nplay. And when there let them drop all class<br />\nantagonism and join together in some real<br />\nHopkins rooting.<br />\n<br />\nBASKET BALL.<br />\nThe interest shown in basket ball last sea8011 gave the University some idea of the<br />\npossibilities in that branch of sport.

If<br />\na worthy object is always deserving of success, then one which has been rendered possible only by such a long and arduous campaign as the \"Season Ticket Plan\" called<br />\nfor, is deserving of a double portion of success. We are informed by the committee<br />\nthat the sale of tickets, both to students and<br />\nDoubtless those<br />\nalumni, has been large.<br />\nwho intend to purchase, but have not thus<br />\nfar found it convenient to do so, will secure their tickets shortly. Some regulations<br />\nwith regard to the tickets appear not to<br />\nhave been generally understood: first, tickets are transferable, and will admit one person, whether it be the owner or someone else,<br />\nto each game; second, although tickets may<br />\nbe sold only to members of the faculty, students and alumni, yet such persons may buy<br />\nmore than one if they desire.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nbe highly gratifying to the faculty. As to<br />\nthe expediency of the step, our own opinion<br />\nis fixed. We firmly believe that the introduction of the \"honor system\" would not<br />\nonly add to the reputation of the undergraduate department, and to the general esteem<br />\nin which its students are held, but also that<br />\nthe moral effect produced on the mind of the<br />\nindividual student by such a responsibility<br />\nwould be a beneficial one. We are thoroughly in favor of the step. Should a capable<br />\nleader take hold of the matter, we think the<br />\ntime is ripe for putting Hopkins in the proud<br />\nlist of institutions in which the \"honor system\" is enforced.<br /><br />\nIIERE are the song-birds of the<br />\nFreshman Class?<br />\nIs it possible<br />\nare none<br />\nthere<br />\nthe<br />\nclass,<br />\nthat in all<br />\nTerpsiof<br />\neligible to shout at the shrine<br />\nof<br />\nnone<br />\nchore?

A BRIDE, A GROOM, AND A GRAIN OF RICE.<br />\nER head barely reached a hove the<br />\nback of the plush-covered seat in<br />\nfront of me, over the back of which<br />\na few stray wisps of golden-brown hair had<br />\nwandered in a manner as tantalizing as it<br />\nwas delightful. His head, as far away from<br />\nthe golden-brown one as possible, was higher, larger, and darker; and would have been<br />\nentirely uninteresting but for one circumstance\u2014in the very crown there was perched<br />\na grain of rice. Even if there had been no<br />\ntell-tale grain of rice, I think I should soon<br />\nhave discovered their secret. As it was, I<br />\ngave up at once all thought of the monotonous view along the road to Washington, and<br />\nset out to make a few observations in a new<br />\nfield\u2014to-wit, what it is like to be on a honeymoon.<br />\nA glance told me the couple were gentlefolk; from Philadelphia, I soon concluded.<br />\nAt least, she spoke of the railroad \"cor,\"<br />\nand his hat in the rack above showed a<br />\nPhiladelphia shop-mark. There was an indefinable something about the back of the<br />\nbride's head, the only part of her I could<br />\nsee, which satisfied me that she was pretty;<br />\nand when, after a time, I heard her voice,<br />\nI felt sure she was charming as well. Of<br />\nthe groom I had a slightly better view The<br />\nclean-shaven profile, and the broad, athleticlooking shoulders, were those of the average<br />\nyoung American professional man of twentysix or seven. It was a strong, honest face,<br />\nthough, and gave one the impression that its<br />\nowner could be depended upon. I liked the<br />\npair immediately.<br />\nThey were an eminently proper young<br />\ncouple. There was nothing \"spoony\" or sentimental in their deportment. On the other<br />\nhand, they were so preternaturally sedate<br />\nand solemn, that a suspicion, which soon<br />\ngrew to eonviction, took root in my mind.<br />\nThe sly young rogues were actually trying<br />\n\u2014upon a preconcerted plan, I doubted not\u2014<br />\nto pass themselves off as a grave and experienced married pair, whose honeymoon had<br />\ntaken place so long before that they had al.<br /><br />\nH<br /><br />\nmost forgotten they had ever had one. They<br />\nshould have known the thing was impossible.<br />\nEven the boy that sells chewing-gum,<br />\noranges, and stale pop-corn winked knowingly at the porter as he passed them. But<br />\nthey did not know it; so the matron of nineteen, and the middle-aged married man of<br />\ntwenty-six, sat uncomfortably upright at extreme ends of their seat, and looked fixedly<br />\nthe one out of the window and the other at<br />\na magazine. And all the time that mischievous little grain of rice danced gleefully<br />\nabout with every movement of the car, and<br />\ntold the whole story to everyone who would<br />\npause to look at it.<br />\nSuch a condition of things is interesting<br />\nenough at the discovery; but a continuance<br />\nof it soon becomes monotonous.<br />\nHence,<br />\nwhen the train slowed up at Laurel, I was<br />\nglad to see her turn and bend over the magazine he was holding. It was opened, I<br />\nhad previously noticed, to a reproduction of<br />\none of Flagg's or Gibson's heads.<br />\n\"I think she's hideous,\" she said, somewhat spitefully, as she leaned back again.<br />\nHe smiled. \"I was only thinking,\" said<br />\nhe, \"how much prettier someone else's dimples are.\"<br />\n\"Someone else's\" dimples were now very<br />\npretty indeed. He gazed at her for a moment (no longer like a middle-aged married man), and then made what seemed to<br />\nme to be quite an irrevelant statement. \"I<br />\nthink,\" said he, slowly, \"that the English<br />\nrailway coach is much preferable to the<br />\nAmerican style.\" It must have meant something, however, for even the back of her<br />\nneck grew pink.<br />\nAn instant later, though, she became redder still, and her expression changed from<br />\none of\u2014well, of staid, conjugal affection\u2014<br />\nto one of almost ferocious hatred, as her<br />\neye fell upon that poor little grain of rice.<br />\nCautiously, yet venomously, she stretched<br />\nforth her hand, and gathered in the pale<br />\nlittle tell-tale.<br />\nAs she did so she east a<br />\nsearching glance behind, to see if anyone<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nhad observed her action. I tried desperateSPARKS.<br />\nly to look innocently out of the window, but<br />\nAs ye sew, so must ye rip.<br />\nfailed ignominiously. Her eyes\u2014great, big,<br />\nblue eyes\u2014 met mine squarely; I grinned<br />\nSufficient unto the Dean is the evil about.<br />\nlike a hyena, and felt ten times the \"horrid<br />\nthing\" she thought me.

A<br />\nyoung man in the Y. M. C. A. showed me<br />\na list and gave me some advice about different places. When I offered to pay him he<br />\nrefused to accept anything, but asked me instead to join the Y. M. C. A. I thought I<br />\nmight as well take in everything, so I joined;<br />\nthe next day I found in my box a bill for<br />\ndues\u2014payable in advance. The day after,<br />\nas I was walking through the basement,<br />\nthree fellows came up to me and asked me<br />\nto go with them. This seemed rather rude<br />\nto me, because I had not been introduced<br />\nto them, and I did not know what they<br />\nwanted to do, but they were very cordial and<br />\ntook me arm in arm, so I thought it would<br />\nbe all right. When we came to a car line<br />\none of them stooped down and undid my<br />\nshoe. When a car came along he stopped<br />\nit and told me to put my foot on the step<br />\nand tie it\u2014that is, the shoe. The car was<br />\ngoing in my direction so I just got in and<br />\nsat down\u2014next to a nice-looking gentleman<br />\nwith side whiskers\u2014I thought I had seen<br />\nhim in the hall when I took my examinations.<br />\nThe car went off and the fellows seemed<br />\nrather offended that I did not say good-bye<br />\nto them. Anyhow, they went around the<br />\ncorner quickly without looking around.<br />\nI intend to work very hard and I am taking Dr. Greene's course. It occupies only<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nsmall part of one's time and yet is the most<br />\ninteresting and important course in the University.

This is a little more costly than<br />\nthe dances last year, but it has been found<br />\nthat dances cannot be conducted as University dances should be for less than this<br />\namount. The regulation in regard to paying in advance was adopted in order to insure the members of the committee from personal loss.<br />\nThe committee in charge consists of Barton, Chairman; Mengel, Secretary; and<br />\nSioussat, Treasurer, all of the Class of 1906;<br />\nand Hynson and Iglehart from the Junior<br />\nClass. A Freshman will be added to the<br />\ncommittee before the first dance. This posi-<br /><br />\ntion is a competitive one, and will be given<br />\nto the Freshman who secures the largest<br />\nnumber of subscribers out of his own class.<br />\nThe members of the committee, as it now<br />\nstands, are the Junior and Freshmen members of the committee which served last year.<br />\nThe idea of the committee in keeping themselves in office another year was that the<br />\nUniversity might have the benefit of their<br />\ninitial experience in organizing the Club.<br />\nLater in the year some competitive scheme<br />\nwill be devised by which new blood may be<br />\ninfused.<br />\nLast year, as the older students know, witnessed the debut of the Cotillon Club. Previous to last year, there had always been<br />\nHopkins dances, but they were not according to any regular mode. It was early in<br />\nthe year determined to try to have a series<br />\nof dances which would correspond to the<br />\nAssembly dances of other colleges and universities. The dances were a success last<br />\nyear, although there was much room for<br />\nimprovement. This year the committee proposed to take advantage of its past experience and errors, and, with the support of<br />\nthe student body, give a far better series<br />\nof dances.<br />\nIn every other college or university, the<br />\nAssembly dances are events which the undergraduate looks forward to, and the alumni<br />\nlooks back upon, with keen delight. In the<br />\nuse of McCoy Hall, Hopkins has an advantage ever many similar institutions, and we<br />\nought to make the most of it.<br />\nThe following dates have been selected<br />\nfor the dances, all of which are subject to<br />\nchange, however, if they conflict with important events, so that members of teams and<br />\nclubs need have no hesitation in \"signing<br />\nup\" for their season tickets:\u2014<br />\nNovember 25;<br />\nJanuary 12, '1906;<br />\nFebruary 23, 1906.<br />\nIn conclusion, the committee desires to<br />\nstate that its sole idea is to perpetuate attractive and enjoyable University dances,<br />\nand as it desires to be absolutely fair to all,<br />\nwill be glad to receive any suggestions or<br />\nadvice which will help along the good work.<br />\nC. K. MENGEL, '06.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nHOPKINS, 11; DELAWARE, 0.<br />\nUnlike last year, Hopkins opened this season last Saturday with a victory. The team<br />\nfrom Delaware played a fast game but was<br />\nnever dangerous except for one period in the<br />\nsecond half. From the first kick-off the boys<br />\nin Black and Blue showed their superiority,<br />\nand forced the ball by steady gains to the<br />\nfive-yard line, only to lose it on a fumble.<br />\nSoon after this, Worthington was sent over<br />\nthe line for the first touchdown and Bayless<br />\nkicked an easy goal. This ended the scoring in the first half.<br />\nIn the second half Delaware braced up<br />\nand, helped by fumbling on the part of the<br />\nHopkins boys, for some time held their own.<br />\nBut the strain told on them and Hopkins<br />\nsoon added another touchdown to the score.<br />\nFrom this time on Hopkins had things ,its<br />\nown way and time was called with Hopkins<br />\nin possession of the ball on Delaware's fiveyard line.<br />\nTaking the work of the Hopkins team as<br />\na whole, there was a notable lack of team<br />\nwork and formation. This can be accounted<br />\nfor, no doubt, by the lack of practice owing<br />\nto the earliness of the season. Individually<br />\nthe team showed up well, and this individual<br />\nability will count for a great deal when pracOne<br />\ntice has developed the team-work.<br />\nweakness seemed apparent and that was at<br />\nthe ends. On defense the men seemed to<br />\nplay in too close and allowed the opposing<br />\nbacks to circle the ends for several gains.<br />\nThe team this year, if Saturday's lineup can be taken as a sample, will probably<br /><br />\nbe lighter than it was last season. Only five<br />\nof last year's team played against Delaware,<br />\nand two of these were substitutes last year.<br />\nOne pleasing thing was remarked, and that<br />\nis that six of the men who were in the game<br />\nwere undergraduates. Some new men were<br />\nseen on the team who seemed to be all that<br />\ncould be desired. Among these, Moss, of the<br />\nMedical School, and Bayless, a special student, appeared to be the most efficient. Moss<br />\nweighs two hundred pounds or more, and<br />\nhandled his weight well at right guard. Hass'<br />\nanother \"Med.\" played well and held down<br />\nright tackle in good style.<br />\nMoss and Preble seem to have their positions secure for this season, but the final<br />\nmake up of the line positions will depend<br />\nupon whether the men of last year's team<br />\nwho are still in the University come out or<br />\nnot.<br />\nIn the back field the team seems pretty<br />\nwell supplied. Iglehart did well last Saturday at quarter-back, and is heavier than<br />\nhe was last season. As \"Sandy\" Randall is<br />\nstill in the University, the quarter-back position seems to be taken care of. Worthington,<br />\nBayless and Campbell are a trio which is<br />\nhard to beat for ground gaining. They will<br />\nno doubt fill the back positions for the rest<br />\nof the season.<br />\nThe rooters turned out in fair numbers for<br />\nthe first game, and were led by that inspiring Chief Rooter,\"Bob\" Griswold, who filled<br />\nhis conspicuous position as gracefully as he<br />\nwas wont to do last year.<br />\nThe next game will be Saturday, Oct. 21,<br />\n.in Washington, and our team will meet its<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nold rivals, G-e-o-r-g-e George\u2014Washington!<br />\nWashington!!

Mr. Ridgely was chosen for this position and no doubt<br />\nwill fill it ably.<br />\nThis election, although it came early in<br />\nthe season, brings up a question as to what<br />\nwill be the relative merits of the two teams,<br />\nand has already started members of both<br />\nclasses figuring out dope sheets showing how<br />\ntheir class will wipe the other one off the<br />\nfield.<br />\nForetelling the nature of this contest is<br />\ndifficult, because of the unknown quality of<br />\nthe Freshman class. The prophet can get<br />\na very good idea of the Junior eleven because he has seen the team at practice last<br />\nseason, and in actual games where their quality was proved. But with the Freshman<br />\nclass the only chances he has had to see the<br />\nabilities of any prospective members of the<br />\n1908 eleven displayed, has been in the cage<br />\nwhen the aforesaid members were not exactly in football attire.<br />\nThe Junior team has been very fortunate<br />\nin not losing many of its important men. In<br />\nfact, the only man whose loss will be felt<br />\nis Hartmann. The team of '07 also loses<br />\nPease, who will play for '08 this year, but<br />\nwhose loss is partly, if not wholly made up<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nby the fact that MaeSherry, who was disabled with a broken leg last year, is back<br />\nagain better than ever.
