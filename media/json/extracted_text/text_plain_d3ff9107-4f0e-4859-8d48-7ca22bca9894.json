examine<br />\nthe expenditures and structure of<br />\nthe whole University and will<br />\n\"take a look at the budget and<br />\npriorities in the University and<br />\nevaluate the way the

/>\n\"The committee has to look<br />\nvery carefully at the<br />\nadministration, support services,<br />\nstudent services, the Research<br />\nInstitutes, and other areas,\"<br />\nPhillips said.<br />\nOne member of the<br />\nHomewood administration who<br />\nwished to remain unidentified,<br />\n<br />\nsaid that Muller has instituted the<br />\ncommittee because \"he suspects<br

Hopkins have<br />\nslipped in relation to other<br />\nuniversities,\" and wonder<br />\nwhether money is not being<br />\nspent unnecessarily elsewhere.<br />\nPhillips claimed, though, that<br />\nthe issue of administrative excess<br />\nversus faculty salaries is a<br />\n\"perennial question.\"<br />\n\"There's always more fat on<br />\nthe other side of the fence than<br />\non our own,\" he observed.<br />\n<br />\nChrist noted, \"There have<br />\nbeen a few complaints about the<br />\ngrowth of the administration,<br />\nthough I don't know whether<br />\nthey're true or

At that time, it was<br />\ndecided that the needs on the<br />\ncampus were mostly routine and<br />\ncould be handled adequately by<br />\nnursemidWives, she said.<br />\nNumerous undergraduate<br />\nwomen, however, have protested<br />\n<br />\nthat the service presently offered<br />\nis not adequate, but all those<br />\ncontacted requested that names<br />\nbe withheld. \"I would think<br />\ndoctors should be there for<br />\ncounseling,\" said one.<br />\n\"Personally, I would want to go<br />\nto a gynecologist if I had a<br />\nproblem.\"<br />\n\"When I go to a gynecological<br />\nclinic,\" commented another, \"I<br />\nwant to see a certified<br />\ngynecologist,\" while one<br />\ncommented that \"a doctor<br />\nshould be there to prescribe<br />\nmedication and to handle<br />\nproblems.\"<br />\nKing, however, contended,<br />\n\"For the population present on<br />\ncampus and the problems that<br />\n<br />\narise there is little that a<br />\nnurse-midwife can't handle.\"<br />\n\"They offer a full scope of<br />\ncontraceptive counselling for all<br />\ndevices, including history-taking<br />\nto find out which type of device<br />\nis most desirable for the<br />\nindividual student,\" she asserted.<br />\nThe training program for<br />\nnurse -midwives invdlves a<br />\ngraduate program, usually of two<br />\nyears' length, culminating in a<br />\nMasters degree in Nursing or<br />\nPublic Health with a specialty in<br />\nmidwifery.

Not if you consider the<br />\nspecifics.<br />\nTake the problem of graduate medical education. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make<br />\nconsiderably easier with comfortable salary and living conditions.<br />\nCreature comforts aside, the Air Force offers<br />\nprofessional advantages.

If you want training in the<br />\n.practice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his practice in<br />\n<br />\nthr<br />\n<br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation.

Hopkins was<br />\nplagued most of the afternoon by<br />\nthat tough Tiger defense and<br />\nfound itslef pounting from deep<br />\nin their own territory.<br />\nThe Tiger defense scored a<br />\ntouchdown in the first period<br />\nwhen tackle Eldridge Haley<br />\nblocked a Jim Duffy punt and<br />\nfell on it in the end zone for the<br />\nscore. In the second period, Blue<br />\nJay quarterback George<br />\nKeckeison was sacked in the end<br />\nzone for a Towson State safety.<br />\nMuch of the Blue Jay woes can<br />\nbe seen from the statistics.<br />\nHopkins total offense netted<br />\nonly 56 total yards. This<br />\nconsisted of 44 rushes for 29<br />\nyards and 7 of 13 pass<br />\n<br />\ncompletions for only 27 yards.<br />\nFor Towson State, their total<br />\noffense ammassed 336 total<br />\nyards consisting of 30 rushing<br />\nplays accounting for 101 yards<br />\nand 14 of 24 pass completions<br />\naccounting for the other 235<br />\nyards.<br />\nThe Towson State offense was<br />\nled by quarterback Dan Duella<br />\nwho scored two touchdowns, one<br />\non a one yard run, the other on a<br />\nseven yard TD pass from Duella.<br />\nHones was Towson's top rusher.<br />\ncarrying 13 times for 57 yards.<br />\nDuella completed 10 of 16<br />\nthrows for 143 yards. Reserve<br />\nQB Chris Van Syckle was 4 for 8<br />\ncollecting 92 yards.<br />\nAlso, defensive back Brian<br />\nCoulter was hurt early in the<br />\nsecond half on the scoring<br />\npassing play from Duella to<br />\nJones. Both players saw no<br />\nfurther action after their injuries.<br />\nHopefully, both will be back in<br />\nthe line up next Saturday.<br />\n<br />\nFor the second year in a row,<br />\nThe Hopkins Alumni \"H\" Club<br />\nwill be sponsoring a bull roast on<br />\nSaturday, November 16. The<br />\nevent will coincide with a full<br />\nslate of home sports events.<br />\nThe weekend of the Bull Roast<br />\nwill begin with the Blue Jay<br />\nbooters kicking off at home<br />\nagainst visiting Widener College<br />\nat 12:00 noon. Then the Hopkins<br />\ngriders will take on visiting<br />\nDickinson College on the<br />\nHomewood Field at 1:30. The<br />\nBull Roast will begin at 4:00<br />\nfollowing the football game.<br />\nThe proceed of last year's Bull<br />\nRoast helped finance the West<br />\ncoast tour of our NCAA<br />\nchampion lacrosse team.<br />\nUnfortunately, the cost of the<br />\ntrip was not fully met from the<br />\nreceipts of last year's Bull Roast<br />\nand as a result a deficit was<br />\nincurred. Some of the proceeds<br />\nof this year's feast will help to<br />\nmake up for that deficit. The rest<br />\nof the money will go into the<br />\nHopkins \"H\" Club's coffers to be<br />\nused for the development of the<br />\nsports program at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nCoach Henry Ciccarone, head<br />\nmentor of the Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\nteam, is hopeful that the Bull<br />\nRoast will get the full support of<br />\n<br />\nthe Hopkins community. Ticket<br />\nprices are $9.00 and are available<br />\nin the Athletic Center. Also,<br />\ntickets can be purchased from<br />\nany member of the lacrosse team.<br />\nLast year, the event was most<br />\nsuccessful and highly enjoyable.<br />\nThe catering arrangements will be<br />\nprepared by Millrace Catering<br />\nService, one of the finest caterers<br />\nin Baltimore. The menu includes<br />\nroasted beef and bar-b-que<br />\nchicken. There will also be a<br />\nbuffet table featuring everything<br />\nfrom crab soup to knockwurst to<br />\npotato salad. All of these<br />\ndelicasies can be washed down<br />\nwith all the beer you can drink.<br />\nOther events of the Bull Roast<br />\ninclude the raffling off of a $100<br />\n13s-ket of cheer. Also returning<br />\nfrom last year's event will be the<br />\n\"Big 6\" dice wheel and the<br />\nwhiskey wheel.<br />\nThe Bull Roast should prove<br />\nto be another enjoyable outing.<br />\nHopefully, many of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity will turn out to<br />\nsupport the \"H\" Club in its<br />\nefforts to build upon Hopkins<br />\nfine sports tradition.

For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his practice in<br /><br />\nthr<br /><br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to him when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, hut not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed<br />\nappointment rate that is practically nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer. We think<br />\nit could be a real eye-opener.

The<br />\nshutout was the Jay's first in<br />\ntheir last 35 games and only their<br />\nthird in the history of varsity<br />\nfootball at Ho716ns.<br />\nTowson State got revenge on<br />\nthe Blue Jay gridders who<br />\ndefeated the Tigers last year<br />\n33-20. This year, Towson State<br />\nkept its undefeated record intact<br />\nrunning their record to 8-0.<br />\nThe Tigers poinced on the Jays<br />\nquickly scoring three<br />\ntouchdowns in the opening<br />\nperiod. One of the touchdowns<br />\ncame on a blocked Hopkins point<br />\nin the end zone. Towson State<br />\nkept the pressure on throughout<br />\nthe game adding a TD and a<br />\nsafety in the second period<br />\nmaking it 30-0 at the half. The<br />\nTigers added touchdowns in the<br />\nthird and final periods to make<br /><br />\nthe score 44-0.<br />\nThe shutdown was attirbuted<br />\nto the fierce Towson State<br />\ndefense. Hopkins had seven<br />\npossessions in the first 25<br />\nminutes of play and failed to<br />\nmove the football past their own<br />\n25 yard line. Hopkins was<br />\nplagued most of the afternoon by<br />\nthat tough Tiger defense and<br />\nfound itslef pounting from deep<br />\nin their own territory.<br />\nThe Tiger defense scored a<br />\ntouchdown in the first period<br />\nwhen tackle Eldridge Haley<br />\nblocked a Jim Duffy punt and<br />\nfell on it in the end zone for the<br />\nscore. In the second period, Blue<br />\nJay quarterback George<br />\nKeckeison was sacked in the end<br />\nzone for a Towson State safety.<br />\nMuch of the Blue Jay woes can<br />\nbe seen from the statistics.<br />\nHopkins total offense netted<br />\nonly 56 total yards. This<br />\nconsisted of 44 rushes for 29<br />\nyards and 7 of 13 pass<br /><br />\ncompletions for only 27 yards.<br />\nFor Towson State, their total<br />\noffense ammassed 336 total<br />\nyards consisting of 30 rushing<br />\nplays accounting for 101 yards<br />\nand 14 of 24 pass completions<br />\naccounting for the other 235<br />\nyards.<br />\nThe Towson State offense was<br />\nled by quarterback Dan Duella<br />\nwho scored two touchdowns, one<br />\non a one yard run, the other on a<br />\nseven yard TD pass from Duella.<br />\nHones was Towson's top rusher.<br />\ncarrying 13 times for 57 yards.<br />\nDuella completed 10 of 16<br />\nthrows for 143 yards. Reserve<br />\nQB Chris Van Syckle was 4 for 8<br />\ncollecting 92 yards.<br />\nAlso, defensive back Brian<br />\nCoulter was hurt early in the<br />\nsecond half on the scoring<br />\npassing play from Duella to<br />\nJones. Both players saw no<br />\nfurther action after their injuries.<br />\nHopefully, both will be back in<br />\nthe line up next Saturday.<br /><br />\nFor the second year in a row,<br />\nThe Hopkins Alumni \"H\" Club<br />\nwill be sponsoring a bull roast on<br />\nSaturday, November 16. The<br />\nevent will coincide with a full<br />\nslate of home sports events.<br />\nThe weekend of the Bull Roast<br />\nwill begin with the Blue Jay<br />\nbooters kicking off at home<br />\nagainst visiting Widener College<br />\nat 12:00 noon. Then the Hopkins<br />\ngriders will take on visiting<br />\nDickinson College on the<br />\nHomewood Field at 1:30. The<br />\nBull Roast will begin at 4:00<br />\nfollowing the football game.<br />\nThe proceed of last year's Bull<br />\nRoast helped finance the West<br />\ncoast tour of our NCAA<br />\nchampion lacrosse team.<br />\nUnfortunately, the cost of the<br />\ntrip was not fully met from the<br />\nreceipts of last year's Bull Roast<br />\nand as a result a deficit was<br />\nincurred. Some of the proceeds<br />\nof this year's feast will help to<br />\nmake up for that deficit. The rest<br />\nof the money will go into the<br />\nHopkins \"H\" Club's coffers to be<br />\nused for the development of the<br />\nsports program at Johns Hopkins.<br />\nCoach Henry Ciccarone, head<br />\nmentor of the Blue Jay lacrosse<br />\nteam, is hopeful that the Bull<br />\nRoast will get the full support of<br /><br />\nthe Hopkins community. Ticket<br />\nprices are $9.00 and are available<br />\nin the Athletic Center. Also,<br />\ntickets can be purchased from<br />\nany member of the lacrosse team.<br />\nLast year, the event was most<br />\nsuccessful and highly enjoyable.<br />\nThe catering arrangements will be<br />\nprepared by Millrace Catering<br />\nService, one of the finest caterers<br />\nin Baltimore. The menu includes<br />\nroasted beef and bar-b-que<br />\nchicken. There will also be a<br />\nbuffet table featuring everything<br />\nfrom crab soup to knockwurst to<br />\npotato salad. All of these<br />\ndelicasies can be washed down<br />\nwith all the beer you can drink.<br />\nOther events of the Bull Roast<br />\ninclude the raffling off of a $100<br />\n13s-ket of cheer. Also returning<br />\nfrom last year's event will be the<br />\n\"Big 6\" dice wheel and the<br />\nwhiskey wheel.<br />\nThe Bull Roast should prove<br />\nto be another enjoyable outing.<br />\nHopefully, many of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity will turn out to<br />\nsupport the \"H\" Club in its<br />\nefforts to build upon Hopkins<br />\nfine sports tradition. Remember,<br />\ntickets are $9.00 which includes<br />\nadmission to the football game.<br />\nTickets are available at the<br />\nAthletic Center.<br /><br />\nCross-country team beats F&amp;M to everyone's surprise<br />\n\"I don't believe it, but I'll<br />\ntake it\", said Coach Don Masken,<br />\nas the cross-country team had its<br />\nfinest day of the 1974 season<br />\nSaturday, swamping a tough<br />\nFranklin and Marshall team<br />\n19-36 here at Homewood.<br />\nCo-Captain Jeff Greve ran his<br />\nconsecutive win streak to five,<br />\nfinishing in 31:35.<br />\nJim Kennedy was 2nd in<br /><br />\n32:08 ahead of Dave Russell of F<br />\n&amp; M. John Tetzlaff and Jon<br />\nHigdon took 4th and 5th for<br />\nHopkins and Bob Alworth was<br />\n7th to round out the Hopkins<br />\ntop five.<br />\nThe score sheet indicated that<br />\neach Hopkins runner defeated his<br />\ncounter-part on F &amp; M by more<br />\nthan one place. This is especially<br />\nsatisfying to the upperclassmen,<br /><br />\nafter last year's close loss, and<br />\nnever having beaten F &amp; M in a<br />\ndual meet.<br />\nJohn Sakowicz was the 6th<br />\nHopkins runner, in 12th place<br />\noverall. Making his first finish in<br />\nthe top seven was Freshman Dan<br />\nDiveriin a personal best time of<br />\n37:13.<br />\nSean O'Brien, Steve Rothwell,<br /><br />\nJeff Higdon, and Hoe Mohen all<br />\nhad good races, on this humid,<br />\nunseasonal October day.<br />\nThe post race comments of<br />\nmany of the F &amp; M runners<br />\nconfirmed that the tough<br />\nHopkins course again helped the<br />\nhome team.
