Moreover this skepticism was no doubt<br />\nlegally conceived, for it seems that<br />\nthe Barnstormers are actually about<br />\nt amputate that leg of their dramatic anatomy in the use of girls in the<br />\nfemale parts of their forthcoming<br />\nproduction, \"If I were King.\"<br />\nWhether or not the surgical dicctions emanated from exterior or<br />\ninterior sources, is not our pleasure<br />\nto discuss at this time. But the fact<br />\nmains that it is a gesture so<br />\nsagacious that it is quite alien to<br />\nthe usual practices of the various<br />\ndepartments of Hopkins' student<br />\nactivities. It represents a willingness<br />\nto entertain beneficial innovation no<br />\nmatter how radical it may be. Drastis renovations could well be made<br />\nin most any student activity on the<br />\ncampus from the mild instance of<br />\nthe Debating Club to the flagrant<br />\none of the Blue Jay. Yet as far as<br />\nmay be seen the general attitude is<br />\none that has maintained a noxious<br />\nindifference to defects most. gross<br />\nin their conspicuity. Hence, the<br />\nBlue Jay, the Y. M. C. A., the football team, the swimming team,<br />\nthe Debating Club and others, perhaps, are involved in a turmoil too<br />\nmuch like clean-cut comedy to be<br />\nable to guard against a future<br />\nabolishment of all activities that<br />\nmust surely come at the present<br />\npace.<br />\nThe dramatic institution that the<br />\n<br />\nBarnstormer's propose to displace<br />\nis one of not recent antiquation.<br />\nWhen the American Coquette decided to lay aside her bustle and go<br />\nin for college and emancipation, the<br />\ncollege female impersonator began<br />\nto be regarded not only as counterfeit, but as immoral. College boys<br />\nseemed to prefer the promising<br />\nbulge of the coed to the unconvincing pads of the impersonator. Kissing a rough beard on play night,<br />\ncollege heroes discovered, was nothing like necking an affable coed<br />\nduring rehearsals. And so the custom that has persisted at Hopkins<br />\nand several colleges has been placed<br />\namong the moth balls by the dramatic cliques of. Most others.<br />\nTentatively, the Barnstormers<br />\npropose to recruit actresses from the<br />\nCollege for Teachers. This, however, is a singularly dubious task<br />\nthey have set for themselves. As<br />\nyet, we have failed to encounter a<br />\ncoed from the Teachers' College<br />\nwho didn't look just like a coed from<br />\nthe Teachers' College. Hopkins obviously has not been endowed with<br />\nbeautiful girls nor is there any evidence that it has or will give birth<br />\nto passable actresses.<br />\nOne can always appreciate a<br />\nhandsome girl who is a good<br />\nactress. One can even appreciate a<br />\nhandsome girl who isn't a good actress. Girls, however, who have<br />\nneither of these qualities should not<br />\nbecome actresses unless they can<br />\nalso become the mistress of the local dramatic critic.<br />\nH.L.F.<br />\n<br />\nDECORATIONS<br />\n<br />\nDr. Kugler to Address<br />\nLiberal Club<br />\n<br />\nCALL MADE FOR<br />\nBALLET DANCERS<br />\nThe Barnstormers are sending out a call for 16 men to<br />\ntake part in a ballet dance in<br />\nthe 1930 production. The play<br />\nto be given this year is McCarthy's \"If I Were King.\"<br />\n\"Pops\" Swindell, the Barnstormers coach, wishes to<br />\nstage a ballet dance at one<br />\npart of the play.

Moreover this skepticism was no doubt<br />\nlegally conceived, for it seems that<br />\nthe Barnstormers are actually about<br />\nt amputate that leg of their dramatic anatomy in the use of girls in the<br />\nfemale parts of their forthcoming<br />\nproduction, \"If I were King.\"<br />\nWhether or not the surgical dicctions emanated from exterior or<br />\ninterior sources, is not our pleasure<br />\nto discuss at this time. But the fact<br />\nmains that it is a gesture so<br />\nsagacious that it is quite alien to<br />\nthe usual practices of the various<br />\ndepartments of Hopkins' student<br />\nactivities. It represents a willingness<br />\nto entertain beneficial innovation no<br />\nmatter how radical it may be. Drastis renovations could well be made<br />\nin most any student activity on the<br />\ncampus from the mild instance of<br />\nthe Debating Club to the flagrant<br />\none of the Blue Jay. Yet as far as<br />\nmay be seen the general attitude is<br />\none that has maintained a noxious<br />\nindifference to defects most. gross<br />\nin their conspicuity. Hence, the<br />\nBlue Jay, the Y. M. C. A., the football team, the swimming team,<br />\nthe Debating Club and others, perhaps, are involved in a turmoil too<br />\nmuch like clean-cut comedy to be<br />\nable to guard against a future<br />\nabolishment of all activities that<br />\nmust surely come at the present<br />\npace.<br />\nThe dramatic institution that the<br /><br />\nBarnstormer's propose to displace<br />\nis one of not recent antiquation.<br />\nWhen the American Coquette decided to lay aside her bustle and go<br />\nin for college and emancipation, the<br />\ncollege female impersonator began<br />\nto be regarded not only as counterfeit, but as immoral. College boys<br />\nseemed to prefer the promising<br />\nbulge of the coed to the unconvincing pads of the impersonator. Kissing a rough beard on play night,<br />\ncollege heroes discovered, was nothing like necking an affable coed<br />\nduring rehearsals. And so the custom that has persisted at Hopkins<br />\nand several colleges has been placed<br />\namong the moth balls by the dramatic cliques of. Most others.<br />\nTentatively, the Barnstormers<br />\npropose to recruit actresses from the<br />\nCollege for Teachers. This, however, is a singularly dubious task<br />\nthey have set for themselves. As<br />\nyet, we have failed to encounter a<br />\ncoed from the Teachers' College<br />\nwho didn't look just like a coed from<br />\nthe Teachers' College. Hopkins obviously has not been endowed with<br />\nbeautiful girls nor is there any evidence that it has or will give birth<br />\nto passable actresses.<br />\nOne can always appreciate a<br />\nhandsome girl who is a good<br />\nactress. One can even appreciate a<br />\nhandsome girl who isn't a good actress. Girls, however, who have<br />\nneither of these qualities should not<br />\nbecome actresses unless they can<br />\nalso become the mistress of the local dramatic critic.<br />\nH.L.F.<br /><br />\nDECORATIONS<br /><br />\nDr. Kugler to Address<br />\nLiberal Club<br /><br />\nCALL MADE FOR<br />\nBALLET DANCERS<br />\nThe Barnstormers are sending out a call for 16 men to<br />\ntake part in a ballet dance in<br />\nthe 1930 production. The play<br />\nto be given this year is McCarthy's \"If I Were King.\"<br />\n\"Pops\" Swindell, the Barnstormers coach, wishes to<br />\nstage a ballet dance at one<br />\npart of the play.
