They represent a<br />\nconfused effort by a relatively small group of people to<br />\ncreate a protest issue where none really exists.<br />\nIn the first place, the move to divest would be utterly<br />\nineffectual in its tangible consequences. The proportion of<br />\nHopkins-held stock in huge multinational corporations such<br />\nas IBM or General Motors is so small that .its sale would<br />\nhave no effect on the policies of the corporation; the price<br />\nof such stocks would not fall significantly on the New York<br />\nExchange. Neither would bond prices be affected. The<br />\nshares actually have more potential to influence corporate<br />\ndecisions when they are owned by the University, when<br />\nthey can at least be voted in stockholders' meetings.<br />\nEven supposing that divestment could result in some shift<br />\nof corporate holdings away from South Africa, it would still<br />\nbe misdirected as a tool for opposing the South African<br />\nregime. U.S. based firms are much more inclined than<br />\nwhite- ownedmative corporations to train blacks and to give<br />\nthem responsible jobs. It is further doubtful that economic<br />\ntactics are the best or even desirable means for improving<br />\nthe situation. South Africa is one of the soundest places in<br />\nthe world in which to invest; it will be able to generate<br />\ncapital somewhere. Blacks in South Africa are economically<br />\nbetter off, on the average, than those in many other African<br />\nnations. What they lack are individual rights and liberties of<br />\na political nature. Such issues are moot in any case, since<br />\ndivestment would have few if any real effects.<br />\nIn its substance, the call for elimination of Johns<br />\nHopkins' holdings in companies with holdings in South<br />\nAfrica urges a strictly symbolic gesture of opposition to the<br />\ncurrent government there. A grandstand play, pure and<br />\nsimple. But who that matters is out there watching? No<br />\none. The energy and attention should not be wasted, not<br />\nwhen there are problem issues like tuition, the curriculum,<br />\nand student housing waited to be resolved in the real<br />\nHomewood world.<br />\n<br />\nCommittee Lethargy<br />\nIn the last few months, some important groups of faculty<br />\n<br />\nand administrators have proven remarkably slow-moving.<br />\nThe committee to study the distribution of recent and<br />\nfuture faculty cutbacks, chaired by Dr. Jack Greene, was<br />\nformed in April. It has yet to present its recommendation<br />\nto the President. Dr. Muller announced plans to institute a<br />\nstudy and revision of the curriculum in the spring of 1977.<br />\nAmazingly, over a year later, the review committee still<br />\nhasn't even been together in the same room. Cynics who<br />\nclaim this torpor .to be nothing more than the normal<br />\nbureaucratic torpor of a large corporate body should<br />\nconsider this. The dinosaurs, too, were ponderous.

The more dangerously<br />\ncomplex the problem, the<br />\nsimpler is the solution proposed.<br />\nSuch is the case with South<br />\nAfrican apartheid divestment in<br />\ncorporations that operate in the<br />\nRepublic. Divestment designed to<br />\npressure these companies to sell<br />\ntheir holdings and, in turn, to<br />\nforce the ASA to liberalize its<br />\nracial policies would be wrong<br />\nfor both practical and moral<br />\nreasons.<br />\nIt is a highly dubious<br />\nassumption that threatened or<br />\nactual investment by even all<br />\nuniversities would cause the<br />\ncorporations to get out of South<br />\nAfrica or to freeze investment.<br />\nMarkets and conditions for<br />\ninvestment there are simply too<br />\nfavorable, and University-held<br />\nblue chip stocks on the New York<br />\nStock Exchange would be bought<br />\nquickly.<br />\nSuppose, however, that the<br />\nuniversities did have such clout.<br />\nInvestment in South Africa<br />\nwould still continue, albeit less<br />\ndirectly. Today it is as true as<br />\never that supply and demand are<br />\nfar more powerful forces than<br />\nmere political differences. A<br />\nmultinational might simply<br />\ntransfer its South African<br />\nholdings to one of its foreign<br />\nbranches (e.g. General Motors'<br />\nWest German Opel division).<br />\nBusinessmen might form holding<br />\ncompanies in such receptive<br />\ncountries as Malawi, Lesotho,<br />\nand Swaziland. Americans would<br />\ninvest in these African firms,<br />\nwhich would, in turn, invest in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\nLet us suppose, however, that<br />\nwe could plug these loopholes,<br />\nassertion.<br />\nanother doubtful<br />\nAmerican investment is too small<br />\n<br />\na portion of existing foreign<br />\ncapital (15% or $1.5 billion) for<br />\nits removal to have much effect.<br />\nBritain is the principal holder,<br />\nand her ever-ailing economy is<br />\ntoo dependent on South Africa's<br />\nwealth to make divestment<br />\npracticable. Furthermore,<br />\nexisting South African market<br />\nand currency regulations and<br />\nconditions make divestment<br />\nprohibitively unprofitable.<br />\nOne may see Vie futility of<br />\ndivestment more clearly if the<br />\npractice is viewed as a mild form<br />\nof economic sanction. Divestment<br />\nis not a trade boycott, a more<br />\nsevere sanction which South<br />\nAfrica could survive, albeit<br />\nuncomfortably. Though the<br />\nRepublic ,is an underdeveloped<br />\ncountry in many respects, she<br />\npossesses both the modern<br />\nindustrial facilities (especially in<br />\nthe Witwatersrand) and the<br />\ngovernmental and financial<br />\ninfrastructures which ensure that<br />\nSouth Africans or foreigners<br />\ncould take over existing<br />\nAmerican holdings. The<br />\nRepublic's future growth does<br />\ndepend to a major degree on<br />\ncontinued foreign investment,<br />\nadmits Harry Oppenheimer, a<br />\nlongtime foe of the government<br />\nand chairman of the<br />\nAnglo-American corporation, the<br />\ncountry's largest firm and the<br />\nleading mining house. For a time,<br />\ngrowth rates might slow or there<br />\ncould be a recession. However,<br />\nthe very strong and adaptable<br />\neconomy would probably be<br />\nnowhere near collapse, as I<br />\nlearned this summer during my<br />\ntravels through the country.<br />\nThe prospect of a recession<br />\nwould not bring social cha ige;<br />\ninstead, as Oppenheimer<br />\ncorrectly notes, the opposite<br />\nmight take place. In 'The<br />\nEconomist, Oppenheimer writes<br />\nthat the government would<br />\n\"tighten its control over the flow<br />\nof blacks from rural areas to the<br />\ntowns for the simple reason that<br />\nunderemployment in rural areas<br />\nis judged to be less likely to cause<br />\nsocial unrest than massive<br />\ncont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\nPressure<br />\nNeeded<br />\nFor Chang<br />\nBY JACKIE COOLIDGE<br />\n<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nCoalition Against South African<br />\nApartheid (CASAA) has brought<br />\nto this university the nationwide<br />\ncampaign of churches,<br />\nlabor -unions, cities, and<br />\ninstitutions of higher learning to<br />\ndivest of stock links with the<br />\nRepublic of South Africa.<br />\nCASAA's campaign is based on<br />\ntwo major arguments: one moral,<br />\nand the other tactical. It is<br />\nCASAA's position that it is<br />\nmorally wrong to earn money or<br />\nto profit from the racist<br />\napartheid system in South Africa.<br />\nApartheid is the legal separation<br />\nof the races; a system under<br />\nwhich a 15% white minority rules<br />\nover an 85% majority made up of<br />\nBlacks, mixed race \"Coloreds\"<br />\nand Asians.<br />\nThe long range tactical<br />\nargument recognizes that change<br />\nwill occur in South Africa only<br />\nunder intense pressure. Blacks in<br />\nSouth Africa seeking basic<br />\nhuman rights have no legal<br />\nrecourse under apartheid. Law is<br />\nbased on race in white South<br />\nAfrica, and Blacks are considered<br />\naliens with no legal rights.<br />\nEach and every black in South<br />\nAfrica is assigned to live in a<br />\nparticular \"Bantustan\".

It might help<br />\nforce the white South Africans<br />\ninto allowing the changes that<br />\nmust take place, one way or<br />\nanother, before its too late to be<br />\ndone with reletive peace.<br />\nMany people insist that<br />\nwithdrawing U.S. investments<br />\nfrom South Africa would hurt<br />\nthe blacks. But black<br />\nunemployment of blacks is a<br />\nlittle over 1%. The loss of wages<br />\nthat are below the \"poverty<br />\ndatum line\" will not be a huge<br />\nloss to the blacks. Black leaders<br />\nand members of the popular<br />\nresistence movements: the<br />\nAfrican National Congress, the<br />\nPan-Africanist Congress, the<br />\nBlack Peoples' Convention, the<br />\nSouth African Students'<br />\nAssociation, the Black<br />\nConsciousne-s Movement, and<br />\nthe Soweto Students'<br />\nRepresentative Council being the<br />\nmost prominent of these, say<br />\nthat the system of apartheid and<br />\nthe whites' standard of living<br />\nwould be hurt far mare than the<br />\nblacks by dive Ament. They also<br />\nsay that the \"Sullivan Principles\"<br />\nof many U.S. corporations in<br />\nSouth Africa (a commitment to<br />\n\"equal pz fpr equal work\",<br />\n\"special. training programs\" for<br />\nblacks, and integration of \"eating<br />\nand other facilities\") are<br />\nmeaningless as whites are<br />\nguarranteed the skilled jobs and<br />\nthe high pay that goes with them.<br />\nThe Sullivan Principles,<br />\nwell intentioned though they may<br />\nbe, are totally ineffective in the<br />\nface of South African labor law<br />\nand custom that prevent blacks<br />\nfrom advancing rattivie to<br />\nwhites.<br />\n<br />\nThe task is to get U.S.<br />\ncorporations to stop investing in<br />\nSouth Africa and to dismantle<br />\nexisting inve tments. Churches,<br />\nlabor unions, city-councils, and<br />\nuniversities (U. of Wisconsin and<br />\nU. Mass at Amherst have already<br />\ndone so) by divesting their<br />\nhundreds of millions of dollars<br />\ncan make these corporations<br />\nreconsider the investments in<br />\nquestion. Major international<br />\nfinancial institutions, such as the<br />\nWorld Bank, recognizing the<br />\nimpending crisis in South Africa,<br />\nhave already declared the<br />\ncountry a site of high risk for<br />\nlong-term investment. Indeed,<br />\nthe trend these days is shifting<br />\nmore and more to loans, as<br />\n<br />\nunemployment in the cities.\"<br />\nThe industrialist continues to<br />\nsay that any social change at all<br />\nwould result from violence (i.e., a<br />\nrevolution). As any insurrection<br />\nescalated, however, the<br />\ngovernment would apply more<br />\nbrutal police tactics. The already<br />\nonerous bureaucracy of the<br />\nDepartment of Plural<br />\nAdministration would become<br />\nstill more arbitrary and<br />\ninsensitive. Millions of blacks,<br />\nColoreds, and Indians would<br />\nsuffer grievously, and unwillingly<br />\nespecially because a successful<br />\nrevolution would be at best a<br />\n<br />\nopposed to direct investments<br />\nwith which there is more to<br />\nlose.<br />\nThe time has now come for<br />\nJohns Hopkins', as with other<br />\nuniversities, foundations and<br />\nchurches, to face the unpleasant<br />\nfact that not only are we<br />\nsupporting apartheid with our<br />\ninvestments but we are also<br />\ndrawing a handsome profit form<br />\nthe continued existence of<br />\napartheid. Exactly how much 9r<br />\nhow little our single portfolio<br />\naids apartheid may be a useful<br />\nquestion, but it tends to cloud a<br />\nmuch more central issue - namely<br />\nour individual and collective<br />\nresponsibility. More specifically,<br />\nwe must squarely face and<br />\nanswer the fundamental question<br />\nof whether gaining a profit from<br />\nthe maintenance of the brutally<br />\nrepressive form of<br />\nState-sanctioned (and operated)<br />\nracism, known as apartheid, is<br />\nconsistent with the moral<br />\nprinciples upon which this<br />\ninstitution was established.<br />\nThe task of building a New<br />\nSouth Africa is not our direct<br />\nresponsibility, it must primarily<br />\nbe accomplished by all of the<br />\npeople of South Africa together.<br />\nAs investors in apartheid we do<br />\nhowever, face a direct<br />\nresponsibility. We must decide<br />\nwhether or not we with to<br />\ncontinue, our assistance in<br />\nblocking a New South Africa by<br />\nprotecting our profit and casting<br />\nour lot with the \"Old\" South<br />\nAfrica. This is the basic question<br />\nupon which our attention, and<br />\nour conscience, must now focus.<br />\n<br />\npainfully protracted conflict. As<br />\nthe Afrikaners drew into their<br />\nlaager in preparation for a racial<br />\nArmageddon, they too would<br />\nhave to forego many comforts.<br />\nHowever, suffering and sacrifice<br />\nare essential elements of the<br />\nAfrikaner culture, which matured<br />\nin the Great Trek and the<br />\nAnglo-Boer War. The Afrikaners<br />\nbelieve that they are the Chosen<br />\nPeople and that their survival<br />\namidst hardship is proof of their<br />\nElection. Furthermore, South<br />\nAfrica has a broad-based and<br />\nhighly sophisticated defense<br />\nindustry (with, in the near<br />\nfuture, the capacity to make jet<br />\nfighters) as well as a well-trained<br />\nand highly efficient defense and<br />\nsecurity force.

It<br />\nmay be the oldest one of its kind<br />\nin use. Besides this antique there<br />\nare a number of portable<br />\nreflecting telescopes available for<br />\nteaching purposes.

For what need is<br />\nthere to defend as large and prestigious an<br />\ninstitution as Johns Hopkins? There is no visible<br />\nthreat. The University is not on trial. And yet,<br />\nthe spirit of criticism is in the air. Our most<br />\nhallowed moments, our cherished traditions, fall<br />\nlike so many weeds before the scythe. Truth has<br />\nbecome a negative entity, something grudgingly,<br />\ncynically admitted. These values we defend are<br />\nupheld at the cost of credulity. And the only<br />\nmoral judgments we may venture are as to what is<br />\nwrong.<br />\nBefore such a mentality much good<br />\nhas been swept away. Achievement, discipline,<br />\nthe individual will, have been shelved, boxed and<br />\ndated, as though irrelevent to our technical,<br />\ncollective society. The desire to forever go one's<br />\nown way, once admirable, now rests securely in a<br />\nfile marked \"deviance.\" Even primary education<br />\nhas fallen beneath the persistent hand of<br />\ncollective-minded reformers. A child's<br />\nunderstanding of himself and his classmates ranks<br />\nequally, or above, his understanding of the<br />\nmaterial. The invasion of our grammar schools by<br />\npsychologists attests to this. Equality has been<br />\ndeified, and everything is now decided by a vote.<br />\nHigher education has not, could hot, go<br />\n<br />\n'Sex and drugs, two<br />\nof the pleasures and<br />\ncurses of students, are<br />\nto them divinities, or<br />\nat least rituals in the<br />\nworship of a selfeffacing decadence.<br />\nunscathed. In the tumult of the Sixties<br />\ndemocracy replaced reason, and the uneducated<br />\nentered the decision-making process. And so, in<br />\ndefense of Johns Hopkins, as it was intended, as<br />\nit had been, and as it may still be, if we hold<br />\nstrongly enough to what remains. Education first<br />\nand foremost; we may agree on that. But the<br />\nproblem is unsettled; below the surface of the<br />\nabstraction conflicts exist. Education of what<br />\nsqrt? Education for whom? These are the<br />\nquestions which puzzle and divide. The matter, as<br />\nalways, centers on priorities. What we have may<br />\nbe judged only by the standard of what we want,<br />\nand the reasons for our desires explored.<br />\nMy prejudices, therefore, before proceeding. I<br />\nbelieve in, or value highly, what has traditionally<br />\nbeen called a Classical education: History,<br />\nPhilosophy, Languages, Literature, Mathematics,<br />\nScience and Art. It is the stuff of civilization. I do<br />\nnot demand relevance insofar as no meaning<br />\napplied to the word has discredited any member<br />\nof my list. I do not crave practicality, which may<br />\nbe defined as a direct aid to securing<br />\nemployment. With but four years dedicated<br />\nalmost exclusively to educating myself all other<br />\ngoals become secondary. I must confess here my<br />\nchances of acquiring the education I desire are<br />\nslim. Squandered opportunity and misdirection<br />\n<br />\nhave stolen half of my allotted time. But I know<br />\nwhat I have missed, and I speak of education as a<br />\npoor man speaks of wealth.<br />\nTo return to the matter at hand. Which values<br />\nthat I cherish are threatened by the endless<br />\ncriticism directed towards the University by my<br />\nfellow students and some non-students? The<br />\nright, first of all, to be educated by those whose<br />\nknowledge and insight I respect, and whom I<br />\ntrust as educated men. Much has been made of<br />\nthe lack of student influence on fundamental<br />\naspects of their education. This is as it should be.<br />\nWhatever the errors of a surgeon, it is lunacy to<br />\ncorrect\" his mistakes by placing the scalpel in the<br />\nhands of other patients. So first, a postulate:<br />\ncurriculum decisions to be made by the faculty. I<br />\nam aware that this flies in the face of the current<br />\ntrend, toward student power, toward<br />\ndemocratization of the educational process. But<br />\nit is trends such as this which I perceive as<br />\nthreats. Democracy is best left to politics and<br />\nsocial clubs, and in the former case it must be<br />\nrestricted. Majority rule has no place in<br />\neducation.<br />\nSecond, more academic requirements are needed.<br />\nWe will learn if we must. But study is best when<br />\nhabitual. The faculty ought to force the habit on<br />\nus. In this respect I envy the Sciences. The<br />\ngrowth in understanding required as one moves.<br />\nfrom introductory science and mathematics<br />\ncourses to the more advanced theories, is readily<br />\ngrasped. The foundation must be<br />\nwell-constructed. But in the Humanities the<br />\nsituation appears different. We can all read, and<br />\nwe may grasp most ideas with effort. But the<br />\ndevelopment from ancient to medieval to modern<br />\nthought seems less than necessary.We deceive<br />\nourselves. For anyone not acquainted with what<br />\ncame before, modern literature is an endless<br />\nprocess of going back. I offer the example of C.P.<br />\nSnow, who moved from nuclear physics to write<br />\nnovels. We would be amazed to hear of a novelist<br />\nturned physicist. The latter would have too much<br />\nto learn.<br />\nFinally,to the student no quarter shall be<br />\ngiven. Either out of consideration or contempt it<br />\nhas become possible to ease through college while<br />\nexpending but a portion of our mental energies.<br />\nIt is a great tragedy that a graduate of Johns<br />\nHopkins may remain uneducated. In a similar<br />\nvein is the use of incompletes; they are far too<br />\ncommon and cheat those students who rush to<br />\ncomplete their work in the allotted time.<br />\nLikewise the date for picking up new courses is<br />\nfar too late in the semester.<br />\nThese are my preferences, such as may be<br />\nbriefly expressed, defining the position from<br />\nwhich I defend. As for the critics--it seems their<br />\nunofficial credo is that the life of a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins and \"real life\" are mutually<br />\nexclusive. This is impossible to support as the<br />\nlatter is beyond definition while the former may<br />\nbe defined differently for each student. But the<br />\ncritics have something more specific in mind. Life<br />\nat Hopkins is, they argue, protected from the<br />\neconomic and political insecurities of normal life.<br />\nThe campus is a haven, a substitute womb even,<br />\nwithin which students may pursue their studies<br />\nwithout so much as a glance at the problems and<br />\nupheavals in their nation: Hardly a serious<br />\ncriticism, as students are free to participate if<br />\nthey so desire. If many forego participation it<br />\nmay be on account of their satisfaction with the<br />\nstatus quo, or a feeling that politics, and<br />\nlarge-scale social change are serious matters, to be<br />\nbest undertaken by educated individuals. The<br />\nwalls will not fall before I graduate, so I postpone<br />\n<br />\nentry into the fray. Of course, if one holds, with<br />\nmost critics of the University, that the societal<br />\nstatus quo is unjust and oppressive, such<br />\nindifference, even if temporary, is anathema.<br />\nPsychologically this may explain the repeated<br />\ncharges that Hopkins students are apathetic.Many<br />\nof the critics are self-professed revolutionaries,<br />\nand the revolutionary mind exists, thrives on,<br />\ncrisis. We all know how irritating it is, in the<br />\nmidst of our crises, to be met with indifference.<br />\nSo the appellations foisted on the student body<br />\n<br />\nare a kind of self-justification for the critics.<br />\nThere is another aspect to the distinction<br />\ndrawn between Hopkins and the \"real world.\"<br />\nLife at the Univeisity is considered another<br />\nGarden of Eden, a paradise to be found nowhere<br />\nelse. The cocoon-like protection afforded the<br />\nstudents is, we are told, conducive to happiness,<br />\nor at least security, both of which are less<br />\nattainable by the workers who must struggle to<br />\nmeet their needs. Granted, Hopkins affords many<br />\nstudents a life of leisure. But many students are<br />\n<br />\n\f)13KINS<br />\nith<br />\n.tal<br />\nich<br />\n:ed<br />\n.ny<br />\nLes,<br />\nDn,<br />\nhe<br />\nce.<br />\n,dy<br />\n<br />\nDn<br />\n<br />\ner<br />\nre<br />\nhe<br />\nss,<br />\n.tss<br />\nto<br />\nre<br />\n<br />\nfrom working homes,and others must work to<br />\nsupport themselves at school. These people taste<br />\na good deal of that other world the critics regard<br />\nas real.<br />\nTherefore, I do not accept the notion that life<br />\nat Hopkins is \"out of touch.\" Here there is love,<br />\nthere is loneliness, spite, envy,jealousy, truth and<br />\ncourage. There are students looking past work to<br />\nparties. There are lies and deceit, there are<br />\nmarriages and suicides. And how can a place<br />\nwhere the girls with large breasts worship thinness<br />\n<br />\nwhile the slim ones decry their lack of physical<br />\nendowment, be anything but real? And if the<br />\nsu fering outside the gates seems to some of<br />\ngre ater consequence, I repeat that it depends on<br />\none's view. For my part the loss of a job in our<br />\nsociety will never cause the misery that attends<br />\nthe loss of curiousity in a student.<br />\nEnough, then, with the false dichotomy. Johns<br />\nHopkins is a part of the world. A unique part,<br />\ndefinitely, but that is not without reason. If it is<br />\nto remain unique, if its position is not to be<br />\n<br />\nAN ESSAY<br />\nconfused with that of a political institution (a<br />\nmistaken, and ultimately dangerous confusion)<br />\nwe must defend what is special about it. Some<br />\ncharge that Johns Hopkins is run as any other<br />\ncapitalist institution, that an efficient use of<br />\nfunds takes precedence over a more beneficial<br />\nuse. The benefits, we are told, should be to the<br />\nsociety as a whole. I agree. But in my view our<br />\nsociety, our culture, benefits most from a large<br />\npool of educated men and women, the creation<br />\nof which is the first priority of our schools.<br />\nSomething in the charges of the critics amuses me<br />\nhere. There has been a great clamor over the loss<br />\nof faculty for economic reasons. Yet, at the same<br />\ntime, the Administration is castigated for<br />\ninvesting University funds in corporations tied, in<br />\nthe eyes of many, to unjust governments. Let us<br />\nbe consistent. If we wish to avoid the loss of good<br />\nfaculty (and we do), and if it requires financial<br />\nsoundness to attract good faculty members (and<br />\nit does), then we ought to support efforts by the<br />\nAdministration to secure the economic base of<br />\nthe University. But lo! The very people who<br />\nscream for the maintenance of faculty are up in<br />\narms over foreign investments. What can this<br />\nmean but that we are faced with a case which<br />\ncuts both ways; either choice is painful. And yet<br />\nthe critics blame the University administration.<br />\nThe conflict apparently discredits any critic who<br />\ntries to hold both to an educational and a social<br />\nideal.<br />\nBut there exists a group which has managed to<br />\nreconcile the seemingly conflicting parts of the<br />\nproblem. These people are, simply, anti-system. If<br />\nour society were overhauled, they tell us, the<br />\ncontradiction would disappear. It is only in a<br />\ncapitalist country that education must give way<br />\nto sound investment, or social justice in Africa to<br />\neducation here. For them, ultimately, I have no<br />\ncertain reply. Their faith in the future grants<br />\nthem a liberty of speculation my short sight does<br />\nnot allow.<br />\nThis leaves for comment the critics whose<br />\noutlook and style may be termed cynical. As<br />\nthese critics have had, for the two years I have<br />\nbeen in attendance at Hopkins, access to and<br />\ncontrol of the major vehicle for University news,<br />\ntheir influence has been enormous. They direct,<br />\ntowards the school and its environs, endless barbs<br />\nof criticism masking their deep-seated contempt,<br />\nwhich in turn masks their individual insecurities.<br />\nThey betray their position by championing that<br />\nwhich offends the general sense of good taste.<br />\nSex and drugs, two of the pleasures and curses of<br />\nstudents, are to them divinities, or at least rituals<br />\nin the worship of a self-effacing decadence.<br />\nThese people speak, should an audience appear,<br />\nof freedom, of not committing oneself too<br />\ncompletely, and of \"coming to an<br />\nunderstanding.\" Their empty, egotistical chatter<br />\nabounds in rooms and hallways, every so often<br />\nmaking an appearance in the classroom. Like the<br />\nself-proclaimed artists of Henry James they live<br />\nfor nothing but the stance they take. All of life is<br />\nreduced to distinctions in style. Emotions have<br />\nno place in<br />\ntheir<br />\nuniverse.They worship<br />\nthe paradox. What begins as a contradiction in<br />\nthe language is raised to the level of utmost<br />\nprofundity. \"All paradoxes are true,\" they chirp,<br />\nwith a gleam in their eye delivering far more<br />\ninformation than the words they utter.<br />\nThese people ultimately caricature themselves,<br />\nas ethnic organizations often do, when seized<br />\nwith the desire to assert their ethnicity. Their<br />\nfinal goal, one might suppose, is to drain life of<br />\nall content, and render it ridiculous, as it appears<br />\nto their tainted imaginations. I can forsee one<br />\n<br />\nsuch person stepping off a ten-story building<br />\nbecause \"death is an idea\" and \"ideas are<br />\nproducts of the mind.\" But the pavement will<br />\ncontradict his assertion.<br />\nSo we have come full circle, from a question of<br />\nvalues to nihilism. What then have we left to<br />\nconsider? Possibilities only, perhaps an instance<br />\nor two. What have I defended? A university, for<br />\nsure. But more substantially, an idea. That the<br />\nuniversity is a place, first and foremost, designed<br />\nto educate the young has been my contention.<br />\nFear has no place in such an institution. He who<br />\nis embarrassed by failure must learn to accept it,<br />\nto learn from it. But the fear should not be<br />\ncatered to.The students who enter here are not so<br />\n<br />\n'Much has been made<br />\nof the lack of student<br />\ninfluence on<br />\nfundamental aspects<br />\nof their education.<br />\nThis is as it should be.'<br />\nbad as some professors suppose, nor are they as<br />\nintelligent as they themselves imagine. If forced<br />\nto learn, they will. And having learned, perhaps<br />\nthey will grow to love learning. Their opinions<br />\nmust be respected, but only those about which<br />\nthey have thought. The rest,culled from books or<br />\npersons, designed to give them a position on a<br />\nsubject about which they know little, ought to be<br />\ndiscarded.<br />\nIf I may, in closing, venture a criticism of my<br />\nown, it is for the acceptance, by the faculty, of<br />\nsub-standard work. Students have not grown less<br />\nintelligent; only less educated. This ought to be<br />\nrectified, not reinforced, by the courses at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe greatest burden, of course, falls on the<br />\nstudent's shoulders. It is he who must, in the<br />\n<br />\nwords of Ezra Pound,\"INSIST on knowing.\" But<br />\nhe cannot succeed alone. Ever-present to tempt<br />\nhim is the pressure for distinction which<br />\nnourishes his ego and later, after graduation, may<br />\nsupport him materially. But this is a problem for<br />\nindividuals, as the practical solution beckons only<br />\nso much as we uphold the values which underlie<br />\nit. The real problem circles back to the values<br />\nthemselves. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nDaniel Arcure is a Junior from Morris Plains,<br />\nNew Jersey, who has recently seen the light and<br />\nchanged his major back to English.

In iriany<br />\nrespects the portrayal of the contemporary woman is<br />\ninfinitely more realistic today than it was when Doris Day<br />\nand Sandra Dee were making pictures; yet even today's<br />\n\"new woman\" in film is subject to the same moral<br />\nscrutiny that plagued her predecessors. This is exhibited<br />\nno more clearly than in Richard Brooks' film \"Looking<br />\nfor Mr. Goodbar.\"<br />\nTheresa Dunn, the heroine, is sweet and idealistic, and<br />\nteaches deaf children. She was raised in a very strict<br />\nCatholic home by a weak mother and a tyrannical father<br />\nwho spends more time cheering on the Fighting Irish than<br />\ncaring for her. Scoliosis victimized her back muscles as a<br />\nchild, leaving her with a slight limp and a long scar down<br />\nher back from a childhood operation. She blames her<br />\nfather for marrying and having children when he knew he<br />\ncarried the gene for the disease. An abrupt end to a rather<br />\none-sided love affair with her English professor sends<br />\nTerry into a deep depression which she attempts to sooth<br />\nwith booze, sex and drugs. She finds herself in many grim<br />\nsituations, not the least of which is her own murder by an<br />\novernight companion on New Years' Eve.<br />\nBut where, we ask,is the \"new woman,\" this cinematic<br />\nheroine of the seventies? This is nothing but \"Valley of<br />\nthe Dolls\" with a disco beat. Or is it? In the hands of<br />\nfilmmaker Richard Brooks, it is. But in the original form,<br />\nthe best-selling novel by Judith Rossner, it is much more<br />\nthan that. It is a shocking, but nevertheless sensitive<br />\nportrayal of a young woman who, like so many of us,<br />\nhappened to get lost.<br />\nBrooks would like for us to see Theresa as a willful,<br />\nhedonistic brat who deserved exactly what she got- and<br />\nmore. He shows us very little of her pain, her ambivalence<br />\nabout leaving home, her deep-rooted dislike for- and fear<br />\nof- men. The sex scenes- especially the first, when she<br />\nloses her virginity- were directed and acted so as to depict<br />\nTerry as a passionate, highly responsive woman who just<br />\ncan't get enough. Yet in reality, Theresa is insecure about<br />\nsex and uses it as a means of easing her loneliness and<br />\nfeeling of inadequacy, and as a device to hurt men,<br />\ntowards whom she feels bitter anger and resentment.<br />\nWhen she first encounters drugs there is little or no<br />\nevidence of disapproval, and Brooks makes no attempt to<br />\nexplain how Terry becomes involved with these people or<br />\nhow she feels about these situations.<br />\nIn Rossner's novel, however, we are drawn much more<br />\ndeeply into Terry's mind and motivations. We understand<br />\nher every thought and feeling; so much so, in fact, that<br />\n<br />\nDiane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar<br />\nvery little that she does surprises us. We know her so well,<br />\nand what's more, like her so much, that it is not until well<br />\ninto the novel that we really become aware of the<br />\ncomplete character transformation that has taken place.<br />\nSo gradual is her metamorphosis, and so sympathetis is<br />\nRossner's treatment of her, that it is virtually impossible<br />\nto find fault with this poor, miserable creature whose<br />\nbiggest weakness is that she needs love.<br />\nYet from the very first, Brooks sets out to paint Terry<br />\nas a \"bad girl.\" Before she's even left home, she is<br />\npopping Valium and seducing her (married) professor. Her<br />\nattempts to leave home precipitate fights and much<br />\ngnashing of teeth, while in the novel it is basically a<br />\nsimple economic decision. She paints her new apartment<br />\ndark brown (not bright yellow, as in the novel) and is<br />\nshown there at night repeatedly, sulking in somber<br />\nvastness, perched alone atop her yawning double bed. Her<br />\nencounters with men are clod, desperate, even brutal at<br />\ntimes. The men themselves are insulting and vulgar. She<br />\npursues Tony with a dependence that could be labeled<br />\nmasochistic. And while even crazy Tony has elements of<br />\ncharm that endear him to Terry, Brooks totally<br />\nobliterates them.<br />\nDirector Paul Mazursky succeeds where Rossner did,<br />\nwith \"An Unmarried Woman,\" by offering a glimpse into<br />\nthe heroine's mind, and by attempting to look fairly at<br />\ntile men who have touched her life. While the character of<br />\n<br />\nA Eulogy to Keith Moon<br />\n<br />\nThe Who In Concert<br />\nKeith Moon, drummer with The Who, died of an<br />\noverdose last Thursday in London. He had been an<br />\nintegral part of the quartet from its conception in the<br />\nmid-Sixties through the group's newest album \"Who Are<br />\nYou?\" released only a few weeks ago. Personnel changes<br />\nare very common among rock groups, but the constancy<br />\nof The Who has been an interesting exception. Like most<br />\nbands that formed in the mid-Sixties, they first gained<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\npopularity through their live performances. The dynamic<br />\nstage presence of each member- Pete Townshend, Roger<br />\nDaltrey, John Entwistle and Moon- quickly gave Who<br />\nconcerts a superior reputation, and the band a huge<br />\nfollowing. Concerts by The Who have remained<br />\nunparalleled, and it is for this reason that Moon's death<br />\nholds such grave implications for the band's future.<br />\nMany drummers are more skillful than Keith Moon.<br />\nIndeed, most should have little difficulty duplicating his<br />\npart in Townshend's compositions. It was hot Moon's\u2022<br />\ndrumming that made him so imporatnt; his personality<br />\nwas the vital element. In concert, it was the diversity of<br />\nstyle exhibited by the four musicians and their ability to<br />\nbounce off each other so well that created such<br />\nexcitement both on stage and in the audience. Each<br />\nseemed totally absorbed in his individual perfromance-Townshend's leaping chords, Daltrey's whirling mike,<br />\nEntwistle's unmoving stance and Moon's general insanity-and yet each provided a stimulus for the others. The unity<br />\nives validity to the violence of The Who on stage. None<br />\nof the band members was more dominant than the others,<br />\nand their collective energies made The Who in concert<br />\nmore powerful and authentic than any other band.<br />\nThe loss of Keith Moon means the destruction of a<br />\nsynthesis that made The Who great. His drumming may be<br />\nreplaced, but his presence and his rapport with the other<br />\nband members can never be. Moon's death means the<br />\ndeath of The Who as the premium live band. They may<br />\nbe crippled on record as well, but on stage the band will<br />\nexist without all its parts, and any continuation with a<br />\nreplacement would be a bastardization of the originality<br />\nthat made The Who so great.<br />\n<br />\nMartin, Erica's husband, deserves the prize for the<br />\nultimate wimpishness and passivity (and the other male<br />\ncharacters leave much to be desired), Mazursky deserves a<br />\ngreat deal of credit for daring to show the ways in which<br />\nmen victimize and take advantage of women, and for<br />\npresenting a modern woman who is not condemned for<br />\nbeing liberated. Similar in many ways to \"Diary of a Mad<br />\nHousewife,\"\"An Unmarried Woman\" offers insight into a<br />\nwoman who has reached a point at which she will no<br />\nlonger allow men to walk all over her. Martin dumped<br />\nErica as Martin (the professor) dumped Terry. Erica has a<br />\ngreat job, friends, a daughter, and later, a lover who<br />\nrespects her.

Located in the basement of the<br />\nCathedral of the Incarnation, on the corner of St. Paul St.<br />\nand University Pkwy, this tiny theatre has contributed a<br />\nconsiderable amount to the promotion of the arts. Run<br />\non a strictly voluntary basis, the Theatre has managed to<br />\nreceive national recognition as an off-off-Broadway<br />\n\"showcase\" for new plays.<br />\nCorner Theatre produces six plays each season: five<br />\nnew, never-before-performed plays, and one revival of a<br />\ncontemporary drama (this year the revival will be<br />\nTennessee Williams' Period of Adjustment). Although<br />\nmany of the plays put on by Corner Theatre are<br />\nconsidered avante-garde, all of them have definite plots<br />\nand structures.<br />\nThe Theatre's goal is to produce the most professional<br />\nproductions possible, using the least amount of money<br />\npossible. The only person paid is the playwright; however,<br />\n<br />\nthis expense plus rental of the theatre and chairs keeps<br />\nthe budget extremely low. The theatre seats only 75l00<br />\npeople, and almost all its budget is brought in through<br />\nticket sales. Tickets are $3.00, $2.50 for students and<br />\nSenior Citizens with I.D.<br />\nThis season's opening play, Gymnasium, is a modern<br />\ndrama written by a local playwright, H. Jones Baker. The<br />\nplot revolves around a 39-year-old college professor who<br />\nis trapped in a life of routine and formalities, and the<br />\nyoung, bisexual student who convinces him that he can<br />\nregain his youth by getting back into shape. The play<br />\nexplores many kinds of relationships; between a husband<br />\nand wife who have no feeling for each other, between<br />\ncolleagues who have lost perspective on their careers,<br />\nbetween middle age and youth who struggle to maintain<br />\ncontrol over one another. The result is an angry, intense<br />\nplay provoking an uneasy feeling about becoming trapped<br />\ninto any kind of relationship. Gymnasium will be<br />\nperformed Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights,<br />\nSeptember 25th-October 8th at 8:00 (September 23rd is<br />\nsold-out.) For more information and reservations call<br />\n467-3750.<br />\nIn addition to theatrical productions, Corner Theatre<br />\nruns workshops in drama, improvisation, playwriting,<br />\nphotography, speech, movement and dance, all of which<br />\nare open to the public.

The Walters Art Gallery,<br />\nlocated on 600 North Charles Street, is air-conditioned<br />\nand stocked with an unusual assortment of European and<br />\nAsian art treasures.<br />\nOne of the Museum's strongest areas is its Barye<br />\nsculpture collection. Antoine Louis Barye (1796-1875)<br />\nwas a realistic-romantic French sculptor whom William<br />\nWalters befriended and encouraged by purchasing over<br />\n150 of his statues and water colors. Barye's expertise in<br />\nanimal sculpture was officially recognized by the French<br />\ngovernment when it bought his Tiger Hunt in 1836.<br />\nBarye was influenced by the works of the Romantic<br />\npainter, Gericault, as well as by the Neo-classical sculptor,<br />\nBosio, and the painter Gros. His sculptures are small<br />\nbecause of his early training as a goldsmith; Barye<br />\nbelieved that animal statues could exist independently,<br />\nrather than as mere ornamentation.<br />\nHis Classical sculptures such as Theseus and the<br />\nMinotaur follow many of thetraditional rules of sculpting<br />\nand, therefore, look posed and stiff. Barye's hunting<br />\ngroups, with battling men,elephants, tigers, hounds, stags,<br />\nand snakes, throb with Romantic vitality while retaining<br />\nthe accuracy of execution so important in Neo-Classicism.<br />\nThe Walters Gallery contains many of the pieces<br />\noriginally intended for the Duke of Orleans' surtout de<br />\ntable, a nine-foot arrangement that was never completed.<br />\nThe Gallery also owns The Tiger Hunt, The Hippogriff<br />\n(half-bird, half-horse), the silver Walking Lion, and many<br />\nother animal and human sculptures and water colors.<br />\nThe Gallery's first fall opening, \"Netsuke: Miniature<br />\nSculpture of Japan,\" will run from September 25 through<br />\nNovember 12.<br />\n<br />\nPLEASE VOTE!!<br />\nPOETRY &<br />\nFICTION<br />\n<br />\nPHOTOS &<br />\nGRAPHICS<br />\n<br />\nBUSINESS &<br />\nPRODUCTION<br />\n<br />\nWE NEEd TOUR<br />\nCREATiViTy!<br />\n<br />\nA NEW MAgAZiNE.<br />\nFOR youR ART<br />\n<br />\nAdVERTiSiNg<br />\n<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nAN<br />\n<br />\nAyOUT.<br />\n<br />\nANd iMAqiNATION.<br />\n<br />\nSubmit your work to Submit to Box 1108<br />\n, or 899 or call<br />\nhe new student<br />\nmagazine.

The most we can do, they reason, is to pass<br />\nlaws that threat n punishment or build up our armed forces to reduce<br />\nthe number of people who might desire to risk hurting us with a first<br />\nblow, although much of the existing hurt is done by people who are<br />\nretaliating against various forms of injustice. It should be obvious,<br />\ntherefore, that if it were possible to prevent a first blow, prevent every<br />\nkind of injustice, there would be no need for punishment or retaliation,<br />\nbut this would render obsolete further need for government as we know<br />\nit, and would destroy the functions of theologians who preach and pray<br />\nfor our deliverance from evil. It is for these reasons\u2014 the fact that the<br />\nuniversities are at the top echelon of thought and still cannot solve<br />\nthese problems, and that government and religious organizations cli, not<br />\nwant a permanent end to the evils they need to earn their living\u2014 that<br />\nPresident Carter refused to investigate, or allow a scientific<br />\ndemonstration of the claim by a semi-amateur without a degree or title<br />\nof any kind, someone very uneducated according to the standards of<br />\nthe Establishment, that he has discovered a natural, psychological law<br />\nthat can now accomplish, before the turn of the century, what<br />\nheretofore was truly impossible. The Carter Administration reasons,\"If<br />\nsuch a discovery was made, the universities would certainly know about<br />\nit, and we haven't heard a thing, therefore, it obviously must be a<br />\nfraud.\" And many professors who felt their reputations as experts<br />\nthreatened, reason this way,\"If we, with all our learning and intellectual<br />\ncapacity, have not yet come up with such a discovery, how is it possible<br />\nfor someone without any kind of special training to have what he<br />\nclaims he has?\" Consequently, because it is imperative that this<br />\ndiscovery be brought to light before the disdainful arrogance and<br />\nunconscious ignorance of political leaders plunge us into another world<br />\nwar, worse inflation.., crimes.,, taxation... etc., I, Seymour Lessans, am<br />\nappealing to open-minded professors, students and any other interested<br />\npeople to attend a course I am giving at the Johns Hopkins (Baltimore<br />\nFree)University titled BEYOND THE FRAMEWORK OF MODERN<br />\nTHOUGHT beginning the first week in October. The greatest transition<br />\nin history will be launched for the benefit of all mankind, once the<br />\nleaders of the world are taught the principles of this discovery, but first<br />\nthe universities must know what this is all about. Well, am I really<br />\nasking too much for professors to allow a semi-amateur like Gregor<br />\nMendel to demonstrate for them what he has, or will they treat me like<br />\nProfessor Nageli treated him? The very core of his discovery was also<br />\nregarded as impossible by the pride, self importance, and opposing<br />\ntheories of this leading authority who unwittingly forced posthumous<br />\nrecognition on him by refusing to investigate his claims. But today<br />\nMendel is the Father of Genetics, while Nageli is a footnote. So don't<br />\nbe too hasty to use your knowledge and your titles as a standard to<br />\njudge what hasn't even been revealed to you yet. But when it is, should<br />\nyou decide to give me the benefit of the doubt, deny it... if you can.<br />\n<br />\n#\u2022<br />\n<br />\nAdmission $1\"<br />\n<br />\nSHRIVER HALL<br />\nFRIDAY & SATURDAY<br />\nSeptember 15 & 16<br />\n7:30 & 10:00 p.m.<br />\n<br />\nEASY<br />\nChris Walsh,<br />\n<br />\nIncrease your reading<br />\nspeed as much as 100%!<br />\n<br />\nEngineering<br />\n\"It's really boring to read the way<br />\nmost people are taught.

There are more jobs<br />\nin the field, with higher salaries.<br />\nMany Humanities graduates are<br />\nfaced with few jobs and low<br />\npay.\"<br />\nAccording to Thomas, the<br />\nreestablishment of a separate<br />\nSchool of Engineering last April<br />\nled to the rise in Engineering<br /><br />\nTwo Projects Near Completion<br />\nBY ADRIENNE GROSSMAN<br />\nBoth the Mudd Hall and the<br />\nMemorial Gate construction<br />\nprojer\u2022 s are on the verge of<br />\ncompletion, according to<br />\nUniversity Director of Plant<br />\nManagement Bill Compbell.<br />\nSeeley G.

It has<br />\nbeen planned since 1974, but<br />\nconstruction was delayed until<br />\nJanuary of 1977 due to lack of<br />\nfunds. A 1976 gift from the<br />\nG.

The Administration<br />\npredicted last spring that class<br />\nsize would remain the same, and<br />\nthat increased enrollment in<br />\nEngineering would be balanced<br />\nby a drop in pre-medical majors.<br />\nHowever, the decrease has been<br />\nin the Humanities.<br />\nHumanities Publicized<br />\n\"The quality of the<br />\nHumanitie-, program at Hopkins<br />\nis not widely recognized,\"<br />\nThomas said. \"This year we are<br />\nconducting a newspaper<br />\ncampaign to bring before the<br />\npublic aspects of The University<br />\nthat it often doesn't see--work<br />\nbeing done by students and<br />\nfaculty in the<br />\nHumanities.\" The Class of<br />\n1982, chosen from among some<br />\n3300 applicants, represents a<br />\n\"typical spread\" geographically.<br />\nIts 575 members come from 34<br />\nstates, the Virgin Islands, Puerto<br />\nRico, and include 15 foreign<br />\nstudents.<br />\nNo Minority Quotas<br />\nApproximately 10.3% of the<br />\nnew freshmen have minority<br />\nstatus.

They represent a<br />\nconfused effort by a relatively small group of people to<br />\ncreate a protest issue where none really exists.<br />\nIn the first place, the move to divest would be utterly<br />\nineffectual in its tangible consequences. The proportion of<br />\nHopkins-held stock in huge multinational corporations such<br />\nas IBM or General Motors is so small that .its sale would<br />\nhave no effect on the policies of the corporation; the price<br />\nof such stocks would not fall significantly on the New York<br />\nExchange. Neither would bond prices be affected. The<br />\nshares actually have more potential to influence corporate<br />\ndecisions when they are owned by the University, when<br />\nthey can at least be voted in stockholders' meetings.<br />\nEven supposing that divestment could result in some shift<br />\nof corporate holdings away from South Africa, it would still<br />\nbe misdirected as a tool for opposing the South African<br />\nregime. U.S. based firms are much more inclined than<br />\nwhite- ownedmative corporations to train blacks and to give<br />\nthem responsible jobs. It is further doubtful that economic<br />\ntactics are the best or even desirable means for improving<br />\nthe situation. South Africa is one of the soundest places in<br />\nthe world in which to invest; it will be able to generate<br />\ncapital somewhere. Blacks in South Africa are economically<br />\nbetter off, on the average, than those in many other African<br />\nnations. What they lack are individual rights and liberties of<br />\na political nature. Such issues are moot in any case, since<br />\ndivestment would have few if any real effects.<br />\nIn its substance, the call for elimination of Johns<br />\nHopkins' holdings in companies with holdings in South<br />\nAfrica urges a strictly symbolic gesture of opposition to the<br />\ncurrent government there. A grandstand play, pure and<br />\nsimple. But who that matters is out there watching? No<br />\none. The energy and attention should not be wasted, not<br />\nwhen there are problem issues like tuition, the curriculum,<br />\nand student housing waited to be resolved in the real<br />\nHomewood world.<br /><br />\nCommittee Lethargy<br />\nIn the last few months, some important groups of faculty<br /><br />\nand administrators have proven remarkably slow-moving.<br />\nThe committee to study the distribution of recent and<br />\nfuture faculty cutbacks, chaired by Dr. Jack Greene, was<br />\nformed in April. It has yet to present its recommendation<br />\nto the President. Dr. Muller announced plans to institute a<br />\nstudy and revision of the curriculum in the spring of 1977.<br />\nAmazingly, over a year later, the review committee still<br />\nhasn't even been together in the same room. Cynics who<br />\nclaim this torpor .to be nothing more than the normal<br />\nbureaucratic torpor of a large corporate body should<br />\nconsider this. The dinosaurs, too, were ponderous. See how<br />\nthey ended up?<br /><br />\nf:<br /><br />\n'vs<br /><br />\nRealities<br />\nMust Be<br />\nConsidered<br />\nBY DAN WILE<br />\nAmericans love simple<br />\nsolutions. The more dangerously<br />\ncomplex the problem, the<br />\nsimpler is the solution proposed.<br />\nSuch is the case with South<br />\nAfrican apartheid divestment in<br />\ncorporations that operate in the<br />\nRepublic. Divestment designed to<br />\npressure these companies to sell<br />\ntheir holdings and, in turn, to<br />\nforce the ASA to liberalize its<br />\nracial policies would be wrong<br />\nfor both practical and moral<br />\nreasons.<br />\nIt is a highly dubious<br />\nassumption that threatened or<br />\nactual investment by even all<br />\nuniversities would cause the<br />\ncorporations to get out of South<br />\nAfrica or to freeze investment.<br />\nMarkets and conditions for<br />\ninvestment there are simply too<br />\nfavorable, and University-held<br />\nblue chip stocks on the New York<br />\nStock Exchange would be bought<br />\nquickly.<br />\nSuppose, however, that the<br />\nuniversities did have such clout.<br />\nInvestment in South Africa<br />\nwould still continue, albeit less<br />\ndirectly. Today it is as true as<br />\never that supply and demand are<br />\nfar more powerful forces than<br />\nmere political differences. A<br />\nmultinational might simply<br />\ntransfer its South African<br />\nholdings to one of its foreign<br />\nbranches (e.g. General Motors'<br />\nWest German Opel division).<br />\nBusinessmen might form holding<br />\ncompanies in such receptive<br />\ncountries as Malawi, Lesotho,<br />\nand Swaziland. Americans would<br />\ninvest in these African firms,<br />\nwhich would, in turn, invest in<br />\nSouth Africa.<br />\nLet us suppose, however, that<br />\nwe could plug these loopholes,<br />\nassertion.<br />\nanother doubtful<br />\nAmerican investment is too small<br /><br />\na portion of existing foreign<br />\ncapital (15% or $1.5 billion) for<br />\nits removal to have much effect.<br />\nBritain is the principal holder,<br />\nand her ever-ailing economy is<br />\ntoo dependent on South Africa's<br />\nwealth to make divestment<br />\npracticable. Furthermore,<br />\nexisting South African market<br />\nand currency regulations and<br />\nconditions make divestment<br />\nprohibitively unprofitable.<br />\nOne may see Vie futility of<br />\ndivestment more clearly if the<br />\npractice is viewed as a mild form<br />\nof economic sanction.

Churches,<br />\nlabor unions, city-councils, and<br />\nuniversities (U. of Wisconsin and<br />\nU. Mass at Amherst have already<br />\ndone so) by divesting their<br />\nhundreds of millions of dollars<br />\ncan make these corporations<br />\nreconsider the investments in<br />\nquestion.

As any insurrection<br />\nescalated, however, the<br />\ngovernment would apply more<br />\nbrutal police tactics. The already<br />\nonerous bureaucracy of the<br />\nDepartment of Plural<br />\nAdministration would become<br />\nstill more arbitrary and<br />\ninsensitive.

Exactly how much 9r<br />\nhow little our single portfolio<br />\naids apartheid may be a useful<br />\nquestion, but it tends to cloud a<br />\nmuch more central issue - namely<br />\nour individual and collective<br />\nresponsibility. More specifically,<br />\nwe must squarely face and<br />\nanswer the fundamental question<br />\nof whether gaining a profit from<br />\nthe maintenance of the brutally<br />\nrepressive form of<br />\nState-sanctioned (and operated)<br />\nracism, known as apartheid, is<br />\nconsistent with the moral<br />\nprinciples upon which this<br />\ninstitution was established.<br />\nThe task of building a New<br />\nSouth Africa is not our direct<br />\nresponsibility, it must primarily<br />\nbe accomplished by all of the<br />\npeople of South Africa together.<br />\nAs investors in apartheid we do<br />\nhowever, face a direct<br />\nresponsibility. We must decide<br />\nwhether or not we with to<br />\ncontinue, our assistance in<br />\nblocking a New South Africa by<br />\nprotecting our profit and casting<br />\nour lot with the \"Old\" South<br />\nAfrica.

As<br />\nthe Afrikaners drew into their<br />\nlaager in preparation for a racial<br />\nArmageddon, they too would<br />\nhave to forego many comforts.<br />\nHowever, suffering and sacrifice<br />\nare essential elements of the<br />\nAfrikaner culture, which matured<br />\nin the Great Trek and the<br />\nAnglo-Boer War. The Afrikaners<br />\nbelieve that they are the Chosen<br />\nPeople and that their survival<br />\namidst hardship is proof of their<br />\nElection. Furthermore, South<br />\nAfrica has a broad-based and<br />\nhighly sophisticated defense<br />\nindustry (with, in the near<br />\nfuture, the capacity to make jet<br />\nfighters) as well as a well-trained<br />\nand highly efficient defense and<br />\nsecurity force. She has proven<br />\nthat she 'las no qualms about<br />\nusing them.<br />\nThus, bringing about change<br />\nby deliberately and<br />\nindiscriminately increasing the<br />\nsufferiag of those whom that<br />\nchange is supposed to benefit is<br />\nthe height of immorality. Those<br />\nwho advocate such measures<br />\nreveal either an insidious<br />\ninsensitivity towards the future<br />\nof their supposed brothers or a<br />\nterrifying naivete about South<br />\nAfrican politics. The probable<br />\nfailure of divestment would also<br />\nerode the credibility of American<br />\nefforts at peaceful change and<br />\nstrengthen the resolve of both<br />\nthe 'hardline \u2022 'Afrikaners, black<br />\nnationalists and the Soviet<br />\nUnion.

Each blotch on the<br />\nmoon's face resolved itself into a<br />\na plane of craters, and each crater<br />\ninto a bowl. The depth of the<br />\nblack void beyond the moon is<br />\nbreathtaking in a way that a<br />\nphotograph does not convey.<br />\nAnyone who wants to can<br />\nexperience the telescope for<br />\nhimself--either by taking one of<br />\nthe introductory astronomy<br />\ncourses or, for those who know<br />\nhow to use a telescope or who<br />\nare enthusiastic enough to find<br />\nout by going to Professois Walker<br />\nor Davidsen and getting a key to<br />\nthe building.

It<br />\nmay be the oldest one of its kind<br />\nin use. Besides this antique there<br />\nare a number of portable<br />\nreflecting telescopes available for<br />\nteaching purposes. As far as<br />\nresearch is concerned, Hopkins<br />\nprofessors have sent telescopes<br />\ninto space which radio data back<br />\nto the ground. Currently two<br />\nHopkins professors are working<br />\nwith NASA to put a 100-inch<br />\nreflecting telescope, possibly 50<br />\nfeet long, into orbit via space<br />\nshuttle by 1983.

For what need is<br />\nthere to defend as large and prestigious an<br />\ninstitution as Johns Hopkins? There is no visible<br />\nthreat. The University is not on trial. And yet,<br />\nthe spirit of criticism is in the air. Our most<br />\nhallowed moments, our cherished traditions, fall<br />\nlike so many weeds before the scythe. Truth has<br />\nbecome a negative entity, something grudgingly,<br />\ncynically admitted. These values we defend are<br />\nupheld at the cost of credulity. And the only<br />\nmoral judgments we may venture are as to what is<br />\nwrong.<br />\nBefore such a mentality much good<br />\nhas been swept away. Achievement, discipline,<br />\nthe individual will, have been shelved, boxed and<br />\ndated, as though irrelevent to our technical,<br />\ncollective society. The desire to forever go one's<br />\nown way, once admirable, now rests securely in a<br />\nfile marked \"deviance.\" Even primary education<br />\nhas fallen beneath the persistent hand of<br />\ncollective-minded reformers. A child's<br />\nunderstanding of himself and his classmates ranks<br />\nequally, or above, his understanding of the<br />\nmaterial. The invasion of our grammar schools by<br />\npsychologists attests to this. Equality has been<br />\ndeified, and everything is now decided by a vote.<br />\nHigher education has not, could hot, go<br /><br />\n'Sex and drugs, two<br />\nof the pleasures and<br />\ncurses of students, are<br />\nto them divinities, or<br />\nat least rituals in the<br />\nworship of a selfeffacing decadence.<br />\nunscathed. In the tumult of the Sixties<br />\ndemocracy replaced reason, and the uneducated<br />\nentered the decision-making process. And so, in<br />\ndefense of Johns Hopkins, as it was intended, as<br />\nit had been, and as it may still be, if we hold<br />\nstrongly enough to what remains. Education first<br />\nand foremost; we may agree on that. But the<br />\nproblem is unsettled; below the surface of the<br />\nabstraction conflicts exist. Education of what<br />\nsqrt? Education for whom? These are the<br />\nquestions which puzzle and divide. The matter, as<br />\nalways, centers on priorities. What we have may<br />\nbe judged only by the standard of what we want,<br />\nand the reasons for our desires explored.<br />\nMy prejudices, therefore, before proceeding. I<br />\nbelieve in, or value highly, what has traditionally<br />\nbeen called a Classical education: History,<br />\nPhilosophy, Languages, Literature, Mathematics,<br />\nScience and Art. It is the stuff of civilization. I do<br />\nnot demand relevance insofar as no meaning<br />\napplied to the word has discredited any member<br />\nof my list. I do not crave practicality, which may<br />\nbe defined as a direct aid to securing<br />\nemployment. With but four years dedicated<br />\nalmost exclusively to educating myself all other<br />\ngoals become secondary. I must confess here my<br />\nchances of acquiring the education I desire are<br />\nslim. Squandered opportunity and misdirection<br /><br />\nhave stolen half of my allotted time. But I know<br />\nwhat I have missed, and I speak of education as a<br />\npoor man speaks of wealth.<br />\nTo return to the matter at hand. Which values<br />\nthat I cherish are threatened by the endless<br />\ncriticism directed towards the University by my<br />\nfellow students and some non-students? The<br />\nright, first of all, to be educated by those whose<br />\nknowledge and insight I respect, and whom I<br />\ntrust as educated men. Much has been made of<br />\nthe lack of student influence on fundamental<br />\naspects of their education. This is as it should be.<br />\nWhatever the errors of a surgeon, it is lunacy to<br />\ncorrect\" his mistakes by placing the scalpel in the<br />\nhands of other patients. So first, a postulate:<br />\ncurriculum decisions to be made by the faculty. I<br />\nam aware that this flies in the face of the current<br />\ntrend, toward student power, toward<br />\ndemocratization of the educational process. But<br />\nit is trends such as this which I perceive as<br />\nthreats. Democracy is best left to politics and<br />\nsocial clubs, and in the former case it must be<br />\nrestricted. Majority rule has no place in<br />\neducation.<br />\nSecond, more academic requirements are needed.<br />\nWe will learn if we must. But study is best when<br />\nhabitual. The faculty ought to force the habit on<br />\nus. In this respect I envy the Sciences. The<br />\ngrowth in understanding required as one moves.<br />\nfrom introductory science and mathematics<br />\ncourses to the more advanced theories, is readily<br />\ngrasped. The foundation must be<br />\nwell-constructed. But in the Humanities the<br />\nsituation appears different. We can all read, and<br />\nwe may grasp most ideas with effort. But the<br />\ndevelopment from ancient to medieval to modern<br />\nthought seems less than necessary.We deceive<br />\nourselves. For anyone not acquainted with what<br />\ncame before, modern literature is an endless<br />\nprocess of going back. I offer the example of C.P.<br />\nSnow, who moved from nuclear physics to write<br />\nnovels. We would be amazed to hear of a novelist<br />\nturned physicist. The latter would have too much<br />\nto learn.<br />\nFinally,to the student no quarter shall be<br />\ngiven. Either out of consideration or contempt it<br />\nhas become possible to ease through college while<br />\nexpending but a portion of our mental energies.<br />\nIt is a great tragedy that a graduate of Johns<br />\nHopkins may remain uneducated. In a similar<br />\nvein is the use of incompletes; they are far too<br />\ncommon and cheat those students who rush to<br />\ncomplete their work in the allotted time.<br />\nLikewise the date for picking up new courses is<br />\nfar too late in the semester.<br />\nThese are my preferences, such as may be<br />\nbriefly expressed, defining the position from<br />\nwhich I defend. As for the critics--it seems their<br />\nunofficial credo is that the life of a student at<br />\nJohns Hopkins and \"real life\" are mutually<br />\nexclusive. This is impossible to support as the<br />\nlatter is beyond definition while the former may<br />\nbe defined differently for each student. But the<br />\ncritics have something more specific in mind. Life<br />\nat Hopkins is, they argue, protected from the<br />\neconomic and political insecurities of normal life.<br />\nThe campus is a haven, a substitute womb even,<br />\nwithin which students may pursue their studies<br />\nwithout so much as a glance at the problems and<br />\nupheavals in their nation: Hardly a serious<br />\ncriticism, as students are free to participate if<br />\nthey so desire. If many forego participation it<br />\nmay be on account of their satisfaction with the<br />\nstatus quo, or a feeling that politics, and<br />\nlarge-scale social change are serious matters, to be<br />\nbest undertaken by educated individuals. The<br />\nwalls will not fall before I graduate, so I postpone<br /><br />\nentry into the fray. Of course, if one holds, with<br />\nmost critics of the University, that the societal<br />\nstatus quo is unjust and oppressive, such<br />\nindifference, even if temporary, is anathema.<br />\nPsychologically this may explain the repeated<br />\ncharges that Hopkins students are apathetic.Many<br />\nof the critics are self-professed revolutionaries,<br />\nand the revolutionary mind exists, thrives on,<br />\ncrisis. We all know how irritating it is, in the<br />\nmidst of our crises, to be met with indifference.<br />\nSo the appellations foisted on the student body<br /><br />\nare a kind of self-justification for the critics.<br />\nThere is another aspect to the distinction<br />\ndrawn between Hopkins and the \"real world.\"<br />\nLife at the Univeisity is considered another<br />\nGarden of Eden, a paradise to be found nowhere<br />\nelse. The cocoon-like protection afforded the<br />\nstudents is, we are told, conducive to happiness,<br />\nor at least security, both of which are less<br />\nattainable by the workers who must struggle to<br />\nmeet their needs. Granted, Hopkins affords many<br />\nstudents a life of leisure. But many students are<br /><br />\n)13KINS<br />\nith<br />\n.tal<br />\nich<br />\n:ed<br />\n.ny<br />\nLes,<br />\nDn,<br />\nhe<br />\nce.<br />\n,dy<br /><br />\nDn<br /><br />\ner<br />\nre<br />\nhe<br />\nss,<br />\n.tss<br />\nto<br />\nre<br /><br />\nfrom working homes,and others must work to<br />\nsupport themselves at school. These people taste<br />\na good deal of that other world the critics regard<br />\nas real.<br />\nTherefore, I do not accept the notion that life<br />\nat Hopkins is \"out of touch.\" Here there is love,<br />\nthere is loneliness, spite, envy,jealousy, truth and<br />\ncourage. There are students looking past work to<br />\nparties. There are lies and deceit, there are<br />\nmarriages and suicides. And how can a place<br />\nwhere the girls with large breasts worship thinness<br /><br />\nwhile the slim ones decry their lack of physical<br />\nendowment, be anything but real? And if the<br />\nsu fering outside the gates seems to some of<br />\ngre ater consequence, I repeat that it depends on<br />\none's view. For my part the loss of a job in our<br />\nsociety will never cause the misery that attends<br />\nthe loss of curiousity in a student.<br />\nEnough, then, with the false dichotomy. Johns<br />\nHopkins is a part of the world. A unique part,<br />\ndefinitely, but that is not without reason. If it is<br />\nto remain unique, if its position is not to be<br /><br />\nAN ESSAY<br />\nconfused with that of a political institution (a<br />\nmistaken, and ultimately dangerous confusion)<br />\nwe must defend what is special about it. Some<br />\ncharge that Johns Hopkins is run as any other<br />\ncapitalist institution, that an efficient use of<br />\nfunds takes precedence over a more beneficial<br />\nuse. The benefits, we are told, should be to the<br />\nsociety as a whole. I agree. But in my view our<br />\nsociety, our culture, benefits most from a large<br />\npool of educated men and women, the creation<br />\nof which is the first priority of our schools.<br />\nSomething in the charges of the critics amuses me<br />\nhere. There has been a great clamor over the loss<br />\nof faculty for economic reasons. Yet, at the same<br />\ntime, the Administration is castigated for<br />\ninvesting University funds in corporations tied, in<br />\nthe eyes of many, to unjust governments. Let us<br />\nbe consistent. If we wish to avoid the loss of good<br />\nfaculty (and we do), and if it requires financial<br />\nsoundness to attract good faculty members (and<br />\nit does), then we ought to support efforts by the<br />\nAdministration to secure the economic base of<br />\nthe University. But lo! The very people who<br />\nscream for the maintenance of faculty are up in<br />\narms over foreign investments. What can this<br />\nmean but that we are faced with a case which<br />\ncuts both ways; either choice is painful. And yet<br />\nthe critics blame the University administration.<br />\nThe conflict apparently discredits any critic who<br />\ntries to hold both to an educational and a social<br />\nideal.<br />\nBut there exists a group which has managed to<br />\nreconcile the seemingly conflicting parts of the<br />\nproblem. These people are, simply, anti-system. If<br />\nour society were overhauled, they tell us, the<br />\ncontradiction would disappear. It is only in a<br />\ncapitalist country that education must give way<br />\nto sound investment, or social justice in Africa to<br />\neducation here. For them, ultimately, I have no<br />\ncertain reply. Their faith in the future grants<br />\nthem a liberty of speculation my short sight does<br />\nnot allow.<br />\nThis leaves for comment the critics whose<br />\noutlook and style may be termed cynical. As<br />\nthese critics have had, for the two years I have<br />\nbeen in attendance at Hopkins, access to and<br />\ncontrol of the major vehicle for University news,<br />\ntheir influence has been enormous. They direct,<br />\ntowards the school and its environs, endless barbs<br />\nof criticism masking their deep-seated contempt,<br />\nwhich in turn masks their individual insecurities.<br />\nThey betray their position by championing that<br />\nwhich offends the general sense of good taste.<br />\nSex and drugs, two of the pleasures and curses of<br />\nstudents, are to them divinities, or at least rituals<br />\nin the worship of a self-effacing decadence.<br />\nThese people speak, should an audience appear,<br />\nof freedom, of not committing oneself too<br />\ncompletely, and of \"coming to an<br />\nunderstanding.\" Their empty, egotistical chatter<br />\nabounds in rooms and hallways, every so often<br />\nmaking an appearance in the classroom. Like the<br />\nself-proclaimed artists of Henry James they live<br />\nfor nothing but the stance they take. All of life is<br />\nreduced to distinctions in style. Emotions have<br />\nno place in<br />\ntheir<br />\nuniverse.They worship<br />\nthe paradox. What begins as a contradiction in<br />\nthe language is raised to the level of utmost<br />\nprofundity. \"All paradoxes are true,\" they chirp,<br />\nwith a gleam in their eye delivering far more<br />\ninformation than the words they utter.<br />\nThese people ultimately caricature themselves,<br />\nas ethnic organizations often do, when seized<br />\nwith the desire to assert their ethnicity. Their<br />\nfinal goal, one might suppose, is to drain life of<br />\nall content, and render it ridiculous, as it appears<br />\nto their tainted imaginations. I can forsee one<br /><br />\nsuch person stepping off a ten-story building<br />\nbecause \"death is an idea\" and \"ideas are<br />\nproducts of the mind.\" But the pavement will<br />\ncontradict his assertion.<br />\nSo we have come full circle, from a question of<br />\nvalues to nihilism. What then have we left to<br />\nconsider? Possibilities only, perhaps an instance<br />\nor two. What have I defended? A university, for<br />\nsure. But more substantially, an idea. That the<br />\nuniversity is a place, first and foremost, designed<br />\nto educate the young has been my contention.<br />\nFear has no place in such an institution. He who<br />\nis embarrassed by failure must learn to accept it,<br />\nto learn from it. But the fear should not be<br />\ncatered to.The students who enter here are not so<br /><br />\n'Much has been made<br />\nof the lack of student<br />\ninfluence on<br />\nfundamental aspects<br />\nof their education.<br />\nThis is as it should be.'<br />\nbad as some professors suppose, nor are they as<br />\nintelligent as they themselves imagine. If forced<br />\nto learn, they will. And having learned, perhaps<br />\nthey will grow to love learning. Their opinions<br />\nmust be respected, but only those about which<br />\nthey have thought. The rest,culled from books or<br />\npersons, designed to give them a position on a<br />\nsubject about which they know little, ought to be<br />\ndiscarded.<br />\nIf I may, in closing, venture a criticism of my<br />\nown, it is for the acceptance, by the faculty, of<br />\nsub-standard work. Students have not grown less<br />\nintelligent; only less educated. This ought to be<br />\nrectified, not reinforced, by the courses at<br />\nHopkins.<br />\nThe greatest burden, of course, falls on the<br />\nstudent's shoulders. It is he who must, in the<br /><br />\nwords of Ezra Pound,\"INSIST on knowing.\" But<br />\nhe cannot succeed alone. Ever-present to tempt<br />\nhim is the pressure for distinction which<br />\nnourishes his ego and later, after graduation, may<br />\nsupport him materially. But this is a problem for<br />\nindividuals, as the practical solution beckons only<br />\nso much as we uphold the values which underlie<br />\nit. The real problem circles back to the values<br />\nthemselves. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nDaniel Arcure is a Junior from Morris Plains,<br />\nNew Jersey, who has recently seen the light and<br />\nchanged his major back to English.

In iriany<br />\nrespects the portrayal of the contemporary woman is<br />\ninfinitely more realistic today than it was when Doris Day<br />\nand Sandra Dee were making pictures; yet even today's<br />\n\"new woman\" in film is subject to the same moral<br />\nscrutiny that plagued her predecessors. This is exhibited<br />\nno more clearly than in Richard Brooks' film \"Looking<br />\nfor Mr. Goodbar.\"<br />\nTheresa Dunn, the heroine, is sweet and idealistic, and<br />\nteaches deaf children. She was raised in a very strict<br />\nCatholic home by a weak mother and a tyrannical father<br />\nwho spends more time cheering on the Fighting Irish than<br />\ncaring for her. Scoliosis victimized her back muscles as a<br />\nchild, leaving her with a slight limp and a long scar down<br />\nher back from a childhood operation. She blames her<br />\nfather for marrying and having children when he knew he<br />\ncarried the gene for the disease. An abrupt end to a rather<br />\none-sided love affair with her English professor sends<br />\nTerry into a deep depression which she attempts to sooth<br />\nwith booze, sex and drugs. She finds herself in many grim<br />\nsituations, not the least of which is her own murder by an<br />\novernight companion on New Years' Eve.<br />\nBut where, we ask,is the \"new woman,\" this cinematic<br />\nheroine of the seventies? This is nothing but \"Valley of<br />\nthe Dolls\" with a disco beat. Or is it? In the hands of<br />\nfilmmaker Richard Brooks, it is. But in the original form,<br />\nthe best-selling novel by Judith Rossner, it is much more<br />\nthan that. It is a shocking, but nevertheless sensitive<br />\nportrayal of a young woman who, like so many of us,<br />\nhappened to get lost.<br />\nBrooks would like for us to see Theresa as a willful,<br />\nhedonistic brat who deserved exactly what she got- and<br />\nmore. He shows us very little of her pain, her ambivalence<br />\nabout leaving home, her deep-rooted dislike for- and fear<br />\nof- men. The sex scenes- especially the first, when she<br />\nloses her virginity- were directed and acted so as to depict<br />\nTerry as a passionate, highly responsive woman who just<br />\ncan't get enough. Yet in reality, Theresa is insecure about<br />\nsex and uses it as a means of easing her loneliness and<br />\nfeeling of inadequacy, and as a device to hurt men,<br />\ntowards whom she feels bitter anger and resentment.<br />\nWhen she first encounters drugs there is little or no<br />\nevidence of disapproval, and Brooks makes no attempt to<br />\nexplain how Terry becomes involved with these people or<br />\nhow she feels about these situations.<br />\nIn Rossner's novel, however, we are drawn much more<br />\ndeeply into Terry's mind and motivations. We understand<br />\nher every thought and feeling; so much so, in fact, that<br /><br />\nDiane Keaton in Looking for Mr. Goodbar<br />\nvery little that she does surprises us. We know her so well,<br />\nand what's more, like her so much, that it is not until well<br />\ninto the novel that we really become aware of the<br />\ncomplete character transformation that has taken place.<br />\nSo gradual is her metamorphosis, and so sympathetis is<br />\nRossner's treatment of her, that it is virtually impossible<br />\nto find fault with this poor, miserable creature whose<br />\nbiggest weakness is that she needs love.<br />\nYet from the very first, Brooks sets out to paint Terry<br />\nas a \"bad girl.\" Before she's even left home, she is<br />\npopping Valium and seducing her (married) professor. Her<br />\nattempts to leave home precipitate fights and much<br />\ngnashing of teeth, while in the novel it is basically a<br />\nsimple economic decision. She paints her new apartment<br />\ndark brown (not bright yellow, as in the novel) and is<br />\nshown there at night repeatedly, sulking in somber<br />\nvastness, perched alone atop her yawning double bed. Her<br />\nencounters with men are clod, desperate, even brutal at<br />\ntimes. The men themselves are insulting and vulgar. She<br />\npursues Tony with a dependence that could be labeled<br />\nmasochistic. And while even crazy Tony has elements of<br />\ncharm that endear him to Terry, Brooks totally<br />\nobliterates them.<br />\nDirector Paul Mazursky succeeds where Rossner did,<br />\nwith \"An Unmarried Woman,\" by offering a glimpse into<br />\nthe heroine's mind, and by attempting to look fairly at<br />\ntile men who have touched her life. While the character of<br /><br />\nA Eulogy to Keith Moon<br /><br />\nThe Who In Concert<br />\nKeith Moon, drummer with The Who, died of an<br />\noverdose last Thursday in London. He had been an<br />\nintegral part of the quartet from its conception in the<br />\nmid-Sixties through the group's newest album \"Who Are<br />\nYou?\" released only a few weeks ago. Personnel changes<br />\nare very common among rock groups, but the constancy<br />\nof The Who has been an interesting exception. Like most<br />\nbands that formed in the mid-Sixties, they first gained<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\npopularity through their live performances. The dynamic<br />\nstage presence of each member- Pete Townshend, Roger<br />\nDaltrey, John Entwistle and Moon- quickly gave Who<br />\nconcerts a superior reputation, and the band a huge<br />\nfollowing. Concerts by The Who have remained<br />\nunparalleled, and it is for this reason that Moon's death<br />\nholds such grave implications for the band's future.<br />\nMany drummers are more skillful than Keith Moon.<br />\nIndeed, most should have little difficulty duplicating his<br />\npart in Townshend's compositions. It was hot Moon's\u2022<br />\ndrumming that made him so imporatnt; his personality<br />\nwas the vital element. In concert, it was the diversity of<br />\nstyle exhibited by the four musicians and their ability to<br />\nbounce off each other so well that created such<br />\nexcitement both on stage and in the audience. Each<br />\nseemed totally absorbed in his individual perfromance-Townshend's leaping chords, Daltrey's whirling mike,<br />\nEntwistle's unmoving stance and Moon's general insanity-and yet each provided a stimulus for the others. The unity<br />\nives validity to the violence of The Who on stage. None<br />\nof the band members was more dominant than the others,<br />\nand their collective energies made The Who in concert<br />\nmore powerful and authentic than any other band.<br />\nThe loss of Keith Moon means the destruction of a<br />\nsynthesis that made The Who great. His drumming may be<br />\nreplaced, but his presence and his rapport with the other<br />\nband members can never be. Moon's death means the<br />\ndeath of The Who as the premium live band. They may<br />\nbe crippled on record as well, but on stage the band will<br />\nexist without all its parts, and any continuation with a<br />\nreplacement would be a bastardization of the originality<br />\nthat made The Who so great.<br /><br />\nMartin, Erica's husband, deserves the prize for the<br />\nultimate wimpishness and passivity (and the other male<br />\ncharacters leave much to be desired), Mazursky deserves a<br />\ngreat deal of credit for daring to show the ways in which<br />\nmen victimize and take advantage of women, and for<br />\npresenting a modern woman who is not condemned for<br />\nbeing liberated. Similar in many ways to \"Diary of a Mad<br />\nHousewife,\"\"An Unmarried Woman\" offers insight into a<br />\nwoman who has reached a point at which she will no<br />\nlonger allow men to walk all over her. Martin dumped<br />\nErica as Martin (the professor) dumped Terry. Erica has a<br />\ngreat job, friends, a daughter, and later, a lover who<br />\nrespects her. Theresa has her work, and little else. She is<br />\nnot evil any more than Erica is. She just dealt with<br />\nrejection the only way she knew. Yet Brooks saw fit to<br />\ndepict her tragedy as just punishment for misbehaving.<br />\nIf Richard Brooks had wanted to, he could have made<br />\nan excellent film about a naive young woman who feels<br />\nalienated in a vast unfriendly city. Licking fresh wounds<br />\nas well as her lifelong scars, she cries out for warmth and<br />\nacceptance, and some relief from her anguish. But by<br />\ndistorting Rossner's incisive novel, he has succeeded only<br />\nin sensationalism, in reaffirming his own ignorance and<br />\nmale chauvinism, and casting women in another injurious<br />\nstereotype- new, but just as degrading.<br /><br />\n,<br />\n\u2022AraMit<br />\nNHS<br /><br />\nThe Baltimore City Fair will be this weekend on<br />\nFriday, noon to 10 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from<br />\n10 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the Innner Harbor.

Located in the basement of the<br />\nCathedral of the Incarnation, on the corner of St. Paul St.<br />\nand University Pkwy, this tiny theatre has contributed a<br />\nconsiderable amount to the promotion of the arts. Run<br />\non a strictly voluntary basis, the Theatre has managed to<br />\nreceive national recognition as an off-off-Broadway<br />\n\"showcase\" for new plays.<br />\nCorner Theatre produces six plays each season: five<br />\nnew, never-before-performed plays, and one revival of a<br />\ncontemporary drama (this year the revival will be<br />\nTennessee Williams' Period of Adjustment). Although<br />\nmany of the plays put on by Corner Theatre are<br />\nconsidered avante-garde, all of them have definite plots<br />\nand structures.<br />\nThe Theatre's goal is to produce the most professional<br />\nproductions possible, using the least amount of money<br />\npossible. The only person paid is the playwright; however,<br /><br />\nthis expense plus rental of the theatre and chairs keeps<br />\nthe budget extremely low. The theatre seats only 75l00<br />\npeople, and almost all its budget is brought in through<br />\nticket sales. Tickets are $3.00, $2.50 for students and<br />\nSenior Citizens with I.D.<br />\nThis season's opening play, Gymnasium, is a modern<br />\ndrama written by a local playwright, H. Jones Baker. The<br />\nplot revolves around a 39-year-old college professor who<br />\nis trapped in a life of routine and formalities, and the<br />\nyoung, bisexual student who convinces him that he can<br />\nregain his youth by getting back into shape. The play<br />\nexplores many kinds of relationships; between a husband<br />\nand wife who have no feeling for each other, between<br />\ncolleagues who have lost perspective on their careers,<br />\nbetween middle age and youth who struggle to maintain<br />\ncontrol over one another. The result is an angry, intense<br />\nplay provoking an uneasy feeling about becoming trapped<br />\ninto any kind of relationship. Gymnasium will be<br />\nperformed Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights,<br />\nSeptember 25th-October 8th at 8:00 (September 23rd is<br />\nsold-out.)

Antoine Louis Barye (1796-1875)<br />\nwas a realistic-romantic French sculptor whom William<br />\nWalters befriended and encouraged by purchasing over<br />\n150 of his statues and water colors. Barye's expertise in<br />\nanimal sculpture was officially recognized by the French<br />\ngovernment when it bought his Tiger Hunt in 1836.<br />\nBarye was influenced by the works of the Romantic<br />\npainter, Gericault, as well as by the Neo-classical sculptor,<br />\nBosio, and the painter Gros. His sculptures are small<br />\nbecause of his early training as a goldsmith; Barye<br />\nbelieved that animal statues could exist independently,<br />\nrather than as mere ornamentation.<br />\nHis Classical sculptures such as Theseus and the<br />\nMinotaur follow many of thetraditional rules of sculpting<br />\nand, therefore, look posed and stiff.

The most we can do, they reason, is to pass<br />\nlaws that threat n punishment or build up our armed forces to reduce<br />\nthe number of people who might desire to risk hurting us with a first<br />\nblow, although much of the existing hurt is done by people who are<br />\nretaliating against various forms of injustice. It should be obvious,<br />\ntherefore, that if it were possible to prevent a first blow, prevent every<br />\nkind of injustice, there would be no need for punishment or retaliation,<br />\nbut this would render obsolete further need for government as we know<br />\nit, and would destroy the functions of theologians who preach and pray<br />\nfor our deliverance from evil. It is for these reasons\u2014 the fact that the<br />\nuniversities are at the top echelon of thought and still cannot solve<br />\nthese problems, and that government and religious organizations cli, not<br />\nwant a permanent end to the evils they need to earn their living\u2014 that<br />\nPresident Carter refused to investigate, or allow a scientific<br />\ndemonstration of the claim by a semi-amateur without a degree or title<br />\nof any kind, someone very uneducated according to the standards of<br />\nthe Establishment, that he has discovered a natural, psychological law<br />\nthat can now accomplish, before the turn of the century, what<br />\nheretofore was truly impossible. The Carter Administration reasons,\"If<br />\nsuch a discovery was made, the universities would certainly know about<br />\nit, and we haven't heard a thing, therefore, it obviously must be a<br />\nfraud.\" And many professors who felt their reputations as experts<br />\nthreatened, reason this way,\"If we, with all our learning and intellectual<br />\ncapacity, have not yet come up with such a discovery, how is it possible<br />\nfor someone without any kind of special training to have what he<br />\nclaims he has?\" Consequently, because it is imperative that this<br />\ndiscovery be brought to light before the disdainful arrogance and<br />\nunconscious ignorance of political leaders plunge us into another world<br />\nwar, worse inflation.., crimes.,, taxation... etc., I, Seymour Lessans, am<br />\nappealing to open-minded professors, students and any other interested<br />\npeople to attend a course I am giving at the Johns Hopkins (Baltimore<br />\nFree)University titled BEYOND THE FRAMEWORK OF MODERN<br />\nTHOUGHT beginning the first week in October. The greatest transition<br />\nin history will be launched for the benefit of all mankind, once the<br />\nleaders of the world are taught the principles of this discovery, but first<br />\nthe universities must know what this is all about. Well, am I really<br />\nasking too much for professors to allow a semi-amateur like Gregor<br />\nMendel to demonstrate for them what he has, or will they treat me like<br />\nProfessor Nageli treated him? The very core of his discovery was also<br />\nregarded as impossible by the pride, self importance, and opposing<br />\ntheories of this leading authority who unwittingly forced posthumous<br />\nrecognition on him by refusing to investigate his claims.
