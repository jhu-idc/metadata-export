The idea began to<br />\nassume its present form when Greg<br />\nMertz presented it before the Hopkins Student Council.

The institution can<br />\nprovide a place for the exchange<br />\nof ideas between all members of<br />\n<br />\nlanned<br />\nthe Baltimore Community.

The opportunities opened are unlimited.\"<br />\nFree universities have sprung<br />\nup in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania<br />\n,California and Ithica, New York<br />\nIn each case, the idea had its inception on a college campus.

To date, he<br />\nhas made three public speeches or policy statements since December<br />\nwhich concern the undergraduate student body. In each instance, he<br />\nmade these statements after minimal dialogue with the students and<br />\neach time he has shown little effort to communicate these statements<br />\nto us. The first instance was his address to the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools where ironically enough he<br />\ncalled for \"a systematic means for dialogue with student representatives.\" At that time, Dr. Gordon had declined to address the undergraduate body on his views and yet he proceeded to make a major<br />\npolicy statement elsewhere. No effort was made by his office to in :<br />\nform Hopkins students about his position prior to a Baltimore Sun<br />\npress account. Dr. Gordon's executive assistant asserted that his inauguration would be the proper time to direct policy statements to<br />\nthe student body at-large, yet even in this case, few students were<br />\nadmitted to his speech.<br />\nNow we learn, according to Dr. Gordon, that the \"administration,<br />\nfaculty, students and alumni are deeply pleased\" about the selection<br />\nof a new chairman for the Board of Trustees. Since Dr. Gordon has<br />\nforegone the responsibility to speak to us, we question his right to<br />\nspeak for us. Dr. Gordon's statement was particularly laughable since<br />\na majority of Hopkins students were completely unaware that a new<br />\nchairman had been appointed. Of course, it must be realized that this<br />\nis the usual public relations spiel to be administered to the press.<br />\nHowever, even this innocuous and obnoxious slip serves to remind<br />\nthe Hopkins student of his relative unimportance in the affairs of<br />\nthis University. If the students and their government are going to<br />\npersist in allowing this sad situation to exist, we would at least hope<br />\nthat in the future, Dr. Gordon will speak only for himself and those<br />\nwhom he represents.<br />\n<br />\nTwo Too Few<br />\nIn the past, the News-Letter has provided little space in its pages<br />\nfor Student Council activities, and especially, Student Council elections. We felt that until the Council showed a concern for being relevant, there was no need to waste either the student's time or ours.<br />\nHowever,it has been pointed out that perhaps this attitude was partly<br />\nresponsible for the lack of interest in the Council, For this reason,<br />\nwe offer you the platforms of the candidates for the Student Council presidency which appear on page five.<br />\nUnfortunately, this election again demonstrates the failure of the<br />\nCouncil to move from the realm of the laughable to one of creative<br />\nleadership. We had hoped that a number of candidates, with fresh<br />\nand 'challenging outlooks, would automatically enter the race to fill<br />\nthe leadership void. One candidate has been on the Council for two<br />\nyears and thus he must share the guilt for the atmosphere which rendered the Council ineffective. The other candidate appears to be<br />\nforwarded by a fraternity which seems to have the strange ambition<br />\nof producing small-time BMOC's, (yes, that same fraternity which<br />\nbrought you the now-famous \"Yes, Virginia ...\"treasury of wisdom<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins Journal.) That the upcoming elections could<br />\nonly produce these two candidates is another sad proof of the Council's failure to stir any interest on campus.<br />\nWe cannot, in good faith, be enthusiastic about either of the two<br />\ncandidates or offer them a full endorsement. Mr. Boehlke's platform<br />\nis vague and written on the same level which we used to see in high<br />\nschool. His platform appears to be contrived in the hope that it will<br />\nanger no one.<br />\n. In the previously mentioned Journal article, Mr. Boehlke, when<br />\nasked what he would do if given power, replied that he \"wouldn't<br />\nknow what to do with it.\" We hope that the undergraduate body will<br />\nnot burden him.<br />\nIn the past, we have disagreed with Mr. Passarella, especially in<br />\nregard to his actions concerning the defunct Student Bill of Rights.<br />\nHowever, judging from the limited choice, we hope that Mr. Passarella wins the election. We wholeheartedly endorse his sincere and<br />\nenergetic efforts to push through a calendar reform and his desire to<br />\nopen University financial records to the student. We can only hope,<br />\nthat if elected, he will not wait for the University to \"grace\" the<br />\nundergraduates by throwing scraps of reform to the Council. It is<br />\ntime for the students to take the initiative.<br />\n<br />\nWho Can We Believe?<br />\nIn case you haven't noticed, we are still fighting a war in Viet<br />\nNam, Americans are still dying there, and bombs are still being dropped on the North. Lyndon Johnson's decision to de-escalate bombing<br />\nbrought cries of relief throughout the country last Sunday night;<br />\nbut by Monday morning, the credibility of our nation was once<br />\nagain strained after learning that the bombing line reached into more<br />\nthan 200 miles of North Viet Nam's territory. Hanoi has now made<br />\nadvances towards beginning negotiations and our administration has<br />\nreluctantly showed signs of willingness to negotiate. Most government<br />\nofficials seem to feel that Hanoi is interpreting the events of the<br />\npast week as a sign of weakness, and might now force the U.S. to accept its peace terms. Such an attitude almost immediately dooms<br />\nsuccessful peace talks to failure. Our government must go to the<br />\npeace tables willing to compromise in order to gain a solution to the<br />\nwar. It is unfortunate that Johnson did not completely override the<br />\nThieu regime; by agreeing to negotiate with the NLF,and by calling<br />\nfor an immediate graduated withdrawal of our troops. At this moment, the only thing we can be sure of is that Lyndon Johnson will<br />\nnot be President next January 20th. Or can we?<br />\n<br />\nBy KENNETH W.

The President had to pick the '48 or '52<br />\nversion of Truman: stand on his<br />\nrecord and \"give 'em hell\", or admit his illegitimacy in the eyes of<br />\nthe peace-loving majority and resign. In choosing the latter, the<br />\nPresident in one night on television displayed more courage and<br />\nhonesty than he has shown in the<br />\nlast five years.

On a fine team effort built<br />\naround an eleven hit attack, they<br />\novercame a 5-2 deficit enroute to<br />\na 9-7 triumph.

In the second<br />\nperiod Pfeifer picked up the ball<br />\nin the midst of a midfield melee,<br />\nran it upfield, passed perfectly<br />\nto Hall in front of the net, who<br />\nturned and tossed it into the net<br />\nfor a picture goal over his shoulder.

To date, he<br />\nhas made three public speeches or policy statements since December<br />\nwhich concern the undergraduate student body. In each instance, he<br />\nmade these statements after minimal dialogue with the students and<br />\neach time he has shown little effort to communicate these statements<br />\nto us. The first instance was his address to the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools where ironically enough he<br />\ncalled for \"a systematic means for dialogue with student representatives.\" At that time, Dr. Gordon had declined to address the undergraduate body on his views and yet he proceeded to make a major<br />\npolicy statement elsewhere. No effort was made by his office to in :<br />\nform Hopkins students about his position prior to a Baltimore Sun<br />\npress account. Dr. Gordon's executive assistant asserted that his inauguration would be the proper time to direct policy statements to<br />\nthe student body at-large, yet even in this case, few students were<br />\nadmitted to his speech.<br />\nNow we learn, according to Dr. Gordon, that the \"administration,<br />\nfaculty, students and alumni are deeply pleased\" about the selection<br />\nof a new chairman for the Board of Trustees. Since Dr. Gordon has<br />\nforegone the responsibility to speak to us, we question his right to<br />\nspeak for us. Dr. Gordon's statement was particularly laughable since<br />\na majority of Hopkins students were completely unaware that a new<br />\nchairman had been appointed. Of course, it must be realized that this<br />\nis the usual public relations spiel to be administered to the press.<br />\nHowever, even this innocuous and obnoxious slip serves to remind<br />\nthe Hopkins student of his relative unimportance in the affairs of<br />\nthis University. If the students and their government are going to<br />\npersist in allowing this sad situation to exist, we would at least hope<br />\nthat in the future, Dr. Gordon will speak only for himself and those<br />\nwhom he represents.<br /><br />\nTwo Too Few<br />\nIn the past, the News-Letter has provided little space in its pages<br />\nfor Student Council activities, and especially, Student Council elections. We felt that until the Council showed a concern for being relevant, there was no need to waste either the student's time or ours.<br />\nHowever,it has been pointed out that perhaps this attitude was partly<br />\nresponsible for the lack of interest in the Council, For this reason,<br />\nwe offer you the platforms of the candidates for the Student Council presidency which appear on page five.<br />\nUnfortunately, this election again demonstrates the failure of the<br />\nCouncil to move from the realm of the laughable to one of creative<br />\nleadership. We had hoped that a number of candidates, with fresh<br />\nand 'challenging outlooks, would automatically enter the race to fill<br />\nthe leadership void. One candidate has been on the Council for two<br />\nyears and thus he must share the guilt for the atmosphere which rendered the Council ineffective. The other candidate appears to be<br />\nforwarded by a fraternity which seems to have the strange ambition<br />\nof producing small-time BMOC's, (yes, that same fraternity which<br />\nbrought you the now-famous \"Yes, Virginia ...\"treasury of wisdom<br />\nin the Johns Hopkins Journal.) That the upcoming elections could<br />\nonly produce these two candidates is another sad proof of the Council's failure to stir any interest on campus.<br />\nWe cannot, in good faith, be enthusiastic about either of the two<br />\ncandidates or offer them a full endorsement. Mr. Boehlke's platform<br />\nis vague and written on the same level which we used to see in high<br />\nschool. His platform appears to be contrived in the hope that it will<br />\nanger no one.<br />\n. In the previously mentioned Journal article, Mr. Boehlke, when<br />\nasked what he would do if given power, replied that he \"wouldn't<br />\nknow what to do with it.\" We hope that the undergraduate body will<br />\nnot burden him.<br />\nIn the past, we have disagreed with Mr. Passarella, especially in<br />\nregard to his actions concerning the defunct Student Bill of Rights.<br />\nHowever, judging from the limited choice, we hope that Mr. Passarella wins the election. We wholeheartedly endorse his sincere and<br />\nenergetic efforts to push through a calendar reform and his desire to<br />\nopen University financial records to the student. We can only hope,<br />\nthat if elected, he will not wait for the University to \"grace\" the<br />\nundergraduates by throwing scraps of reform to the Council. It is<br />\ntime for the students to take the initiative.<br /><br />\nWho Can We Believe?<br />\nIn case you haven't noticed, we are still fighting a war in Viet<br />\nNam, Americans are still dying there, and bombs are still being dropped on the North. Lyndon Johnson's decision to de-escalate bombing<br />\nbrought cries of relief throughout the country last Sunday night;<br />\nbut by Monday morning, the credibility of our nation was once<br />\nagain strained after learning that the bombing line reached into more<br />\nthan 200 miles of North Viet Nam's territory. Hanoi has now made<br />\nadvances towards beginning negotiations and our administration has<br />\nreluctantly showed signs of willingness to negotiate. Most government<br />\nofficials seem to feel that Hanoi is interpreting the events of the<br />\npast week as a sign of weakness, and might now force the U.S. to accept its peace terms. Such an attitude almost immediately dooms<br />\nsuccessful peace talks to failure. Our government must go to the<br />\npeace tables willing to compromise in order to gain a solution to the<br />\nwar. It is unfortunate that Johnson did not completely override the<br />\nThieu regime; by agreeing to negotiate with the NLF,and by calling<br />\nfor an immediate graduated withdrawal of our troops. At this moment, the only thing we can be sure of is that Lyndon Johnson will<br />\nnot be President next January 20th. Or can we?<br /><br />\nBy KENNETH W.

The President had to pick the '48 or '52<br />\nversion of Truman: stand on his<br />\nrecord and \"give 'em hell\", or admit his illegitimacy in the eyes of<br />\nthe peace-loving majority and resign. In choosing the latter, the<br />\nPresident in one night on television displayed more courage and<br />\nhonesty than he has shown in the<br />\nlast five years.
