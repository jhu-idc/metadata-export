Straus,<br />\nthe captain of the track team, is<br />\nawaiting news as to the acceptance of his request for a second<br />\nlieutenancy. Major Linton was<br />\ngranted a second lieutenancy in<br />\nthe Officers' Reserve Corps some<br />\ntime ago. Not a few officers are<br />\neagerly awaiting their twentyfirst birthday, at which time they<br />\nexpect to apply.<br />\nOn last Thursday and Friday<br />\nnights, Lieutenant Elliott, who is<br />\nnow rapidly recuperating from<br />\nthe effects of his collision with an<br />\nautomobile last Tuesday night<br />\nwhile on his way to deliver the<br />\nweekly evening lecture in military<br />\nscience, conducted examinations<br />\nfor admittance into the Officers'<br />\nReserve Corps. Quite a number<br />\nof civilians took the examination,<br />\nbut the results are as yet unknown. There are three more lectures before the completion of the<br />\npreparatory course for flip examinations.<br />\nDuring the past week, Lieutenant Elliott has been conferring<br />\nwith the president and the members of the Academic Advisory<br />\nCouncil about the plans that will<br />\nbe adopted should war be declared.<br />\nIt has been decided that in that<br />\nevent drills will be held every (lay,<br />\nexcept Sunday,from 4 to 6 o'clock<br />\nin the afternoon. All conflicting<br />\nlaboratories and classes will,<br />\ntherefore, be suspended and all interest will be centered on making<br />\nthe drills as efficient and instructive as possible.<br />\nLieutenant Elliott is now giving<br />\nthe officers a chance to display the<br />\nknowledge they have gained in<br />\nsighting and attacking an enemy.<br />\nMembers of the corps say that<br />\nthis is not as easy as it sounds,<br />\nbecause the enemy comprises usually only six privates of the corps,<br />\nwhose uniforms blend so perfectly<br />\nwith the underbrush that they<br />\nare practically invisible at several<br />\nhundred yards.

Never<br />\nbefore in the history of the University has such a movement as the<br />\none now under way been attempted.<br />\nThe committee which President Sutton appointed to undertake<br />\nthe establishment of the fund\u2014appointed after a motion that the<br />\nclass attempt to carry through the project had been carried without<br />\na single dissenting vote\u2014consists of Edward M. Stuart (chairman),<br />\nPaul Sutton and Reuben Oppenheimer. Before the banquet hall<br />\nat the Emerson had been deserted, the committee had already received a number of pledges for $500 apiece. The campaign to<br />\nsecure the pledging of the remaining sum will be launched this week:<br />\n\"The function of a college,\" said<br />\nPresident Frank J.Goodnow,in his<br />\nspeech to the Seniors, \"is to teach<br />\nmen how to live. Don't be dis-.<br />\ncouraged, don't claim that your<br />\neducation has been worthless, if<br />\nyou find that your training at<br />\nHopkins does not bring immediate<br />\npecuniary results. That is not<br />\nthe primary object\u2014what we have<br />\nendeavored to give you here is an<br />\neducation which, more than anything else, will teach you how to<br />\n.<br />\nappreciate.\"<br />\n\"The cultural idea of education,\" he continued, \"has always<br />\nbeen emphasized at Johns Hopkins. When the Engineering<br />\nSchool was established, one of the<br />\nmost fundamental considerations<br />\nin the arrangement of the curriculum was the provision of an education which would broaden the<br />\nmen, as well as give them the<br />\ntechnical training required in<br />\ntheir profession.\"<br />\nDr. Goodnow laid especial emphasis throughout his speech upon<br />\nhow much he appreciated the opportunity of coming into more direct touch With Hopkins undergraduates. \"Almost at the end of<br />\ntheir college career,\" he went on,<br />\n\"the members of the Class of 1917<br />\ncould look both backwards and<br />\nforwards\u2014were in a position to<br />\njudge of what their education had<br />\ngiven them and to anticipate the<br />\nway in which it would serve them<br />\nin after life.\"<br />\nThe speech of Prof. Carl C.<br />\nThomas, honorary president of<br />\nthe class, was on \"Partnership in<br />\nthe University.\" Professor Thom<br />\nas, in the course of his speech,<br />\n<br />\nIt was the last speech of the<br />\nevening, and when Toastmaster'<br />\nStuart introduced President Sutton there was none of the goodnatured banter in his tone which<br />\nhad colored his remarks through:<br />\nout the banquet. Vague rumors<br />\nof what was to come had already<br />\nspread about the room, and when<br />\nSutton arose, after the first burst<br />\nof applause, there was the absolute silenCe of expectancy.,<br />\nSutton began his speech by a<br />\nbrief summary of what the Class<br />\nof 1917 had done in its four years<br />\nat the University. He spoke of<br />\nthe various athletic achievements<br />\nand the men who had -made those<br />\nachievements possible, of the literary work, of the common memories of college happenings which<br />\nwould remain with the members<br />\nof the class throughout their lives.<br />\nThen suddenly his tone became<br />\ngraver, and he told in very simple<br />\nwords of the debt which the class<br />\nowed to the University and the<br />\nlove with which that debt was remembered.<br />\n\"There is a way in which that<br />\ndebt can be paid, men,\" he said,<br />\n\"a way which will make the name<br />\nof the Class of 1917 live forever<br />\nin Hopkins history. It may mean<br />\na little sacrifice, a little privation,<br />\nbut the good that it will do and<br />\nthe precedent it will establish for<br />\nall future classes will represent<br />\nyour love for your Alum Mater<br />\nfar better than could 'any other<br />\ntoken.\"<br />\nThe proposition which was to<br />\nbe laid before the class, Sutton<br />\ncontinued, was iiot a neW one\u2014it<br />\nha:1 already been adopted by many<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2)<br />\n<br />\nLq<br />\n<br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br />\n<br />\nMILITARY CENSUS UNDER WAY<br />\nCommittee Preparing Statement of Part<br />\nHopkins Students and Alumni Could<br />\nPlay in Serving Government in<br />\nTime of War.<br />\n<br />\nWithin the next few days the<br />\nfollowing notice will be sent by<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\ncommittee on Organization for<br />\nNational Service through all the<br />\ndepartments of the University:<br />\nThe president and trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhave placed at the service of the<br />\nFederal Government all the resources of the University.

The im- latest, the daylight practice, of<br />\nportant fact is \u2022 that a Hopkins which the football team stands in\u2022<br />\nclass, with the world still to con- such obvious need _could easily<br />\nquer, is ready to pay its debt to become a reality. As is pointed<br />\nthe University-ready before the out elsewhere in this issue, one<br />\nmembers of the class have had an hour of practice before twilight is<br />\nopportunity to realize all that the worth two hours of practice after.<br />\nIndeed, although an earlier reUniversity has given them.<br />\nThat the plan will be carried lease of the football men from<br />\nthrough-that the $25,000 will be work can not, in itself, be exin great part subscribed within pected to guarantee the developthe next few days, no one present ment of successful teams, it is not<br />\n<br />\ntoo niuch to say that such a step<br />\nwould tend to eliminate one of ,<br />\nthe greatest factors which has<br />\nbeen responsible for unsuccess in<br />\nthe past.<br />\nIf Hopkins is to have 8.30<br />\nclasses, however, it is eminently<br />\nfitting that the demand should<br />\ncome from the undergraduates.<br />\nIt is the undergraduates who<br />\nwould be benefited-and, to the<br />\nloyal Hopkins man, the slight inconvenience caused by an earlier<br />\nrising should count as, nothing<br />\nagainst the aid'to the teams which<br />\ncould so be rendered. To the members of the faculty, hoWever,whose<br />\ninterest in athletics, by the nature<br />\nof things,can never be quite such a<br />\npersonal one, earlier classes might<br />\nvery conceivably be highly distasteful. If they can be prevailed<br />\nupon to take the step, it will be<br />\nthe most concrete evidence of their<br />\nstrong sympathy with the undergraduates that they could render.<br />\nThe question, of course, resolves<br />\nitself into how to -have the provi-'<br />\nsion for earlier classes passed.<br />\nHere, in the opinion of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, the old and tried<br />\nmethod of petitioning comes again<br />\ninto its own. A request signed<br />\nby three or four hundred men<br />\nwould be bound to bring the matter into serious consideration.<br />\nOn Wednesday of this week,<br />\ntherefore, THE NEWS-LETTER will<br />\nhave a petition to the effect that<br />\nclasses be begun at 8.30 placed in<br />\ncharge of the postmaster. The<br />\nSigning of the petition, of course,<br />\nwill be entirely optional, but the<br />\neffectiveness of the request will<br />\nlargely depend upon the number<br />\nof men by whom it is endorsed.<br />\nThe Polity Club.<br />\n<br />\nThe formation of a club at Hopkins, constituted entirely of undergraduates, to discuss present<br />\ninternational problems is one of<br />\nthe best signs that there are still<br />\nmen in the undergraduate department who are interested in things<br />\nother than the day's assignment<br />\nin German \"'Rose or the whereabouts of the next the dansant<br />\nwhich has come into evidence for<br />\nquite a long time.<br />\nAn intelligent and earnest interest in the government of the<br />\nworld should be one of the distinguishing marks of the college<br />\nman.

D. the<br />\n1917,<br />\nJames Schouler lecturer for'<br />\nin the fifth of his series of lectures on \"International Readjustments,\" in the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding on Tuesday, March 20.<br />\nDr. Hill then told how this<br />\ncould and should be corrected after the war and said that what<br />\nwas lacking was an organization<br />\nof international justice. This can<br />\nbe remedied, he said, by the formation of a commonwealth of all<br />\nthe states. If such a commonwealth were formed, he explained,<br />\nthe states would still be states;<br />\nthey would retain their same government and would not be compelled to give up any of the power<br />\nthey previously possessed.<br />\n\"The real testing time of democracy,\" Dr. Hill , continued,<br />\n\"will be the moment of victory\u2014<br />\nfor victory there must be\u2014in the<br />\npresent European War. Before<br />\nthe treaty of peace is signed the<br />\ndifferent nations will have to decide between imperialism and democracy, and, awe-struck by the<br />\nmagnitude of this -war, their<br />\nchoice will be democracy. But<br />\nthis choice will not be made by<br />\nthe governments, but by an overwhelming majority of all the people in the world. If democracy<br />\nis chosen and the commonwealth<br />\nof states is formed, then there<br />\nnever again can exist such a condition of affairs as existed on August 1, 1914. On this day there<br />\nwas only one man in Europe who<br />\ncould have prevented, the ,war Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany\u2014and<br />\nhe was no longer able to control<br />\nthe powerful war-making machine<br />\nthat he had himself constructed.\"<br />\nDr. Hill stated that even since<br />\nthe beginning of the war, the internal character of the British<br />\nEmpire had been greatly changed.<br />\nAn organization of republics,<br />\nrather than an empire, is coming<br />\ninto existence in Great Britain, he<br />\nasserted. The autonomous \u2022 colonies of England sent countless<br />\nnumbers of troops to aid her, he<br />\nclaimed, because they felt that democracy itself was imperiled and<br />\nnot from any love of British imperialism. But since these internal changes have been made,<br />\nthe colonies are more at \u2022 heart<br />\nwith their mother country, and<br />\nin Canada alone an army outnumbering the combined forces of<br />\nthe Duke of Wellington, General<br />\nBlucher and Napoleon at the<br />\nBattle of 'Waterloo is now being<br />\ntrained.<br />\nGetting back to his main<br />\nsubject, Dr. Hill stated that the<br />\nfirst article in a treaty of peace<br />\n<br />\n5<br />\n<br />\nPSYCHOLOGISTS TEST INFANTS<br />\n<br />\nHOW THE ENDOWMENT FUND WOULD OPERATE<br />\nAt the request of THE NEWS-LETTER,the Massachusetts Mutual<br />\nLife Insurance Company has prepared a statement of the exact<br />\nmanner in which the 1917 Endowment Fund would be created.<br />\nWhile the committee appointed by President Sutton has not yet<br />\ndetermined upon the company with which the class will deal, the<br />\nfollowing provisions give a good idea of the general conditions of<br />\nthe plan.\u2014Editor.<br />\n<br />\n1. Each individual endowment policy is payable at maturity or<br />\nprior death direct to the trustees of the University. The individual<br />\npolicy-holder cannot change the beneficiary, borrow against the<br />\npolicy, or avail himself of any of the policy's privileges which are<br />\nall entirely under the control of the University trustees.<br />\n2. Premium notices will be sent to each policy-holder, and duplicate notices will also be sent to the University treasurer covering<br />\neach policy.<br />\n3. Thirty-one days' grace without interest charge is allowed in<br />\npayment of each premium after the first, and the University treasurer will be promptly advised of any delinquents.<br />\n4. Annual dividends are declared on all policies, and slips, showing the amount of the dividend and interest thereon credited to<br />\neach policy are sent to the University treasurer every year. Unless<br />\notherwise arranged for, these dividends are held by the company,<br />\nand improved annually at compound interest (3 per cent. guaranteed, 4% per cent. now being allowed), and on the basis of the com4 per<br />\n/<br />\npany's present dividend schedule and compound interest at 43<br />\ncent. the fund will be increased materially. This fund can also be<br />\nused at the discretion of the University in assisting any member of<br />\nthe fund who needs temporary help in paying his premiums. In<br />\naddition to this the company furnishes their automatic credit system attached to the policy whereby any premium after the first ean<br />\nbe carried by the company for a considerable time, should any member be unable to pay same when due.<br />\n5. A special disability clause is provided in this arrangement,<br />\nwhereby if any member be totally and permanently disabled, the reinajning premiums during the period of total and permanent disability will be paid by the company, without affecting the contract<br />\nin any way, nor decreasing the fund to any extent whatever..<br />\n6. The rate at age 25 is as follows:<br />\n$48.23 per annum.<br />\n$1,000<br />\n36.18 per annum.<br />\n750<br />\n')4.12 per annum.<br />\n500<br />\nThe rate at age 20 is as follows:<br />\n$1,000<br />\n$47.74 per annum.<br />\n750<br />\n35.81 per annum.<br />\n500<br />\n23.87 per annum.<br />\n7. The policy provides automatie non-forfeiture provisions after<br />\nthe first year, so that there is no possible way for an enrolled member to fail to be of benefit by joining this class fund.<br />\n8. Arrangements have been made to take care of the members of<br />\nthe class who are now members of the militia before war is declared. As this may come at any time now, the advisability of<br />\nthese men taking immediate action, if they desire to lend their aid<br />\nin this great cause, can readily be seen.<br />\n<br />\nshould be an invitation to all the nations in the world to enter into<br />\na commonwealth and become a<br />\npart of it.<br />\n\"And if such a commonwealth<br />\nis formed,\" Dr. Hill concluded,<br />\n\"perpetual peace will be the result.\"<br />\nThe last lecture of the series<br />\nwas given on March 22, and was<br />\non \"International Organization.\"<br />\nIn this lecture, Dr. Hill discussed<br />\nplans \u2022 for securing permanent<br />\npeace after this war.<br />\nDr. Hill started by saying that<br />\nthe world is not and never will be<br />\ngoverned entirely by pure intelligence, and that' although it is<br />\ncomparatively easy for philosophers to realize a federation of<br />\nnations, it is difficult to believe<br />\nin the practicability of ,a universal state or federation unless human nature changes. All wars,<br />\nhe said, call forth new proposals<br />\nof international peace. He went<br />\non to show how ,unjust and inef-<br />\n<br />\nfective these proposals have been.<br />\nImperial powers, Dr. Hill said,<br />\nwere not willing to give up their<br />\ndesires for increase in power and<br />\nwould therefore not submit to an<br />\ninternational court. Any league<br />\nor conference of nations must be<br />\nmade up at first, as a result, of a<br />\nstrong but limited group of constitutional powers who are willing to give up their national aspirations. This would not be a<br />\nnew state, but only a society of<br />\nstates, all with the same purpose<br />\n\u2014to secure peace and justice.<br />\n\u2022 An international board of trade<br />\nconciliation was also proposed by<br />\nDr. Hill as a very necessary step<br />\nin securing permanent peace. The<br />\nuse of force, said Dr. Hill, to secure business success in foreign<br />\nundeveloped fields has been the<br />\ncause of many wars and will be<br />\nthe cause of future wars, unless<br />\nthe business men of the nations<br />\ncan get together and come to<br />\nagreements whereby co-operation<br />\n<br />\nExperiments Being Carried on by Dr.<br />\nWatson'to Determine Appearance<br />\nof Emotions and Instincts<br />\nin Babies.<br />\n<br />\nProf. John Watson, of the psychology department of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, has recently<br />\nbeen conducting experiments on<br />\ninfants in the maternity ward at<br />\nthe Hopkins Hospital. No thorough scientific work has ever<br />\nbeen done in trying to determine<br />\nthe actions of emotions and instincts in babies, and the results<br />\nof Dr. Watson's experiments may<br />\nstartle the psychological world.<br />\nThe actual work is being carried<br />\non in the psychological laboratory<br />\n.in the Phipps Clinic, where about<br />\nforty babies a month are subjected to the experiments.<br />\nThe first experiments are to discover the earliest appearance of<br />\nemotions and also the situations<br />\nwhich bring out emotions. It is<br />\nhoped that this study will lead to<br />\nthe development of methods by<br />\nwhich it will be possible to change<br />\nand break up wrong emotional attachments and to regulate certain<br />\nglands of the body that depend<br />\nupon these attachments.<br />\nTests are also being made to determine the time of the appearance of the earliest instincts, as<br />\na basis for getting an idea as to<br />\nthe vocation for which the individual would best be fitted. A record of the ages at which various<br />\ninstincts appear and at which different movements, such as co-ordinating eye and hand movements,<br />\nappear, it is hoped will give some<br />\nlight on whether the infants have<br />\nnormal brains. If the psychologists can discover by this means<br />\nwhether an infant has a normal<br />\nor a backward brain, steps could<br />\nbe taken so as to develop the child<br />\nalong lines that would improve his<br />\ncondition.<br />\nLeft and right handedness is being studied, in order to find out<br />\nwhether it is an instinct or merely the result of an accident or of<br />\nhabit. In addition, every involuntary motion of the baby from the<br />\ntime of birth is recorded.<br />\nIt has been noted that an infant, if allowed to grasp a small<br />\nstick, will involuntarily draw himself up and hang suspended from<br />\na few seconds to a minute. This<br />\ngrasping reflex continues for about<br />\nthe first four months in the normal child.<br />\nGreat care has been exercised<br />\nin the handling and testing of the<br />\ninfants. One accident has resulted and no ill health has developed<br />\nin any of the babies tested.<br />\ncan be secured in foreign trade<br />\nand commerce. This economic<br />\nmeans of preventing war is just<br />\nas important as any political<br />\nmethod that could be developed<br />\nto secure international peace and<br />\nsecurity.<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\nTENNIS TEAM FACE HARD SEASON<br />\nGames Scheduled with Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Navy\u2014All<br />\nof Last Year's Players Back, with<br />\nSeveral New Recruits.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022 One of the best and most difficult schedules that any Johns<br />\nHopkins tennis team has ever<br />\nboasted of has been arranged this<br />\nyear by Manager Jacobsen.

In a<br />\nmost graphic and thrilling manner the physician-in-chief of the<br />\nAmerican hospital in Van, Turkey, narrated his experiences<br />\namong the Turkish atrocities in<br />\nthe Lake Van region up to the<br />\ntime when, unconscious from typhus fever, he was carried, slung<br />\non a litter between two mules, to<br />\na place of safety.<br />\nAfter a brief survey of how the<br />\nTurks drove the Armenians in the<br />\nVan region in flocks to be mustered into service and burned the<br />\nhouses of the deserters, and how<br />\nthey rescinded all the rights of<br />\nforeigners, except, to some extent,<br />\nof Americans, he portrayed the<br />\nattempt of the governor-general<br />\nof Van to requisition the drug<br />\nsupplies of the hospital. When<br />\nDr. Ussher refused to accede, a<br />\ncaptain and several policemen<br />\nbroke into the hospital and demanded a barrel of epsom salts,<br />\nwhich they endeavored to remove<br />\nfrom the cellar.<br />\nRealizing that it was up to him<br />\nto defend American rights, Dr.<br />\nUssher flatly refused to yield to<br />\nthe mandates of the captain.<br />\nWhen eight policemen attempted<br />\nto remove him from the trap-door<br />\nleading to the cellar, Rev. E. A.<br />\nYarrow, a missionary at Van,<br />\nstepped to his side, and after a<br />\nbrisk encounter the police retreated. At this moment the Russian<br />\nconsul appeared, -ordered the<br />\nTurks away, and next day compelled the governor-general to<br />\napologize to Dr. Ussher.<br />\nA thrilling description was then<br />\ngiven by Dr. Ussher of the victorious 28-day fight of the Armenians<br />\nwith the Turks, during which the<br />\nhospital buildings were perforated with cannon and rifle balls, the<br />\nRed Cross flag was shot down and<br />\nthe American flag was riddled<br />\nbulets until it fell. Before the<br />\nbattle, Dr. Ussher told the governor that he must not permit his<br />\nsoldiers to fire on American prop\u2022 erty. In spite of this, the governor ordered the guns trained on<br />\nthe hospital. All the inmates of<br />\nthe hospital miraculously escaped,<br />\nhowever, with the exception of a<br />\nlittle girl.. \"One shell,\" Dr. Usslier remarked, \"was hurled into<br />\na room containing 45 people, but<br />\nit burst harmlessly in a barrel of<br />\nwater.\"<br />\n<br />\nNot only is the star veteran<br />\nbaseball team of last year back<br />\npractically intact, but an abundant supply of new material has<br />\nshown up.

Never<br />\nbefore in the history of the University has such a movement as the<br />\none now under way been attempted.<br />\nThe committee which President Sutton appointed to undertake<br />\nthe establishment of the fund\u2014appointed after a motion that the<br />\nclass attempt to carry through the project had been carried without<br />\na single dissenting vote\u2014consists of Edward M. Stuart (chairman),<br />\nPaul Sutton and Reuben Oppenheimer. Before the banquet hall<br />\nat the Emerson had been deserted, the committee had already received a number of pledges for $500 apiece. The campaign to<br />\nsecure the pledging of the remaining sum will be launched this week:<br />\n\"The function of a college,\" said<br />\nPresident Frank J.Goodnow,in his<br />\nspeech to the Seniors, \"is to teach<br />\nmen how to live. Don't be dis-.<br />\ncouraged, don't claim that your<br />\neducation has been worthless, if<br />\nyou find that your training at<br />\nHopkins does not bring immediate<br />\npecuniary results. That is not<br />\nthe primary object\u2014what we have<br />\nendeavored to give you here is an<br />\neducation which, more than anything else, will teach you how to<br />\n.<br />\nappreciate.\"<br />\n\"The cultural idea of education,\" he continued, \"has always<br />\nbeen emphasized at Johns Hopkins. When the Engineering<br />\nSchool was established, one of the<br />\nmost fundamental considerations<br />\nin the arrangement of the curriculum was the provision of an education which would broaden the<br />\nmen, as well as give them the<br />\ntechnical training required in<br />\ntheir profession.\"<br />\nDr. Goodnow laid especial emphasis throughout his speech upon<br />\nhow much he appreciated the opportunity of coming into more direct touch With Hopkins undergraduates. \"Almost at the end of<br />\ntheir college career,\" he went on,<br />\n\"the members of the Class of 1917<br />\ncould look both backwards and<br />\nforwards\u2014were in a position to<br />\njudge of what their education had<br />\ngiven them and to anticipate the<br />\nway in which it would serve them<br />\nin after life.\"<br />\nThe speech of Prof. Carl C.<br />\nThomas, honorary president of<br />\nthe class, was on \"Partnership in<br />\nthe University.\" Professor Thom<br />\nas, in the course of his speech,<br /><br />\nIt was the last speech of the<br />\nevening, and when Toastmaster'<br />\nStuart introduced President Sutton there was none of the goodnatured banter in his tone which<br />\nhad colored his remarks through:<br />\nout the banquet. Vague rumors<br />\nof what was to come had already<br />\nspread about the room, and when<br />\nSutton arose, after the first burst<br />\nof applause, there was the absolute silenCe of expectancy.,<br />\nSutton began his speech by a<br />\nbrief summary of what the Class<br />\nof 1917 had done in its four years<br />\nat the University. He spoke of<br />\nthe various athletic achievements<br />\nand the men who had -made those<br />\nachievements possible, of the literary work, of the common memories of college happenings which<br />\nwould remain with the members<br />\nof the class throughout their lives.<br />\nThen suddenly his tone became<br />\ngraver, and he told in very simple<br />\nwords of the debt which the class<br />\nowed to the University and the<br />\nlove with which that debt was remembered.<br />\n\"There is a way in which that<br />\ndebt can be paid, men,\" he said,<br />\n\"a way which will make the name<br />\nof the Class of 1917 live forever<br />\nin Hopkins history. It may mean<br />\na little sacrifice, a little privation,<br />\nbut the good that it will do and<br />\nthe precedent it will establish for<br />\nall future classes will represent<br />\nyour love for your Alum Mater<br />\nfar better than could 'any other<br />\ntoken.\"<br />\nThe proposition which was to<br />\nbe laid before the class, Sutton<br />\ncontinued, was iiot a neW one\u2014it<br />\nha:1 already been adopted by many<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 10, col. 2)<br /><br />\n(Continued on page 6, col. 2)<br /><br />\nLq<br /><br />\nPRICE, FIVE CENTS<br /><br />\nMILITARY CENSUS UNDER WAY<br />\nCommittee Preparing Statement of Part<br />\nHopkins Students and Alumni Could<br />\nPlay in Serving Government in<br />\nTime of War.<br /><br />\nWithin the next few days the<br />\nfollowing notice will be sent by<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\ncommittee on Organization for<br />\nNational Service through all the<br />\ndepartments of the University:<br />\nThe president and trustees of<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University<br />\nhave placed at the service of the<br />\nFederal Government all the resources of the University.

It will be entirely distinct from any propaganda of anti-preparedness and<br />\nsentimental pacifism. The club<br />\ndoes not represent any such movement, but is rather designed as a<br />\nmeans of acquainting college men<br />\nwith the broader point of view<br />\nfrom which both war and peace are<br />\nbeginning to be regarded, and as<br />\na method of familiarizing the student with current international<br />\nproblems.<br /><br />\nMany<br />\nStyles<br />\nof Type<br />\nand Many<br />\nLanguages<br /><br />\n3<br />\nAt the first meeting, to be held<br />\non April 2, at 8.15 P.

The im- latest, the daylight practice, of<br />\nportant fact is \u2022 that a Hopkins which the football team stands in\u2022<br />\nclass, with the world still to con- such obvious need _could easily<br />\nquer, is ready to pay its debt to become a reality. As is pointed<br />\nthe University-ready before the out elsewhere in this issue, one<br />\nmembers of the class have had an hour of practice before twilight is<br />\nopportunity to realize all that the worth two hours of practice after.<br />\nIndeed, although an earlier reUniversity has given them.<br />\nThat the plan will be carried lease of the football men from<br />\nthrough-that the $25,000 will be work can not, in itself, be exin great part subscribed within pected to guarantee the developthe next few days, no one present ment of successful teams, it is not<br /><br />\ntoo niuch to say that such a step<br />\nwould tend to eliminate one of ,<br />\nthe greatest factors which has<br />\nbeen responsible for unsuccess in<br />\nthe past.<br />\nIf Hopkins is to have 8.30<br />\nclasses, however, it is eminently<br />\nfitting that the demand should<br />\ncome from the undergraduates.<br />\nIt is the undergraduates who<br />\nwould be benefited-and, to the<br />\nloyal Hopkins man, the slight inconvenience caused by an earlier<br />\nrising should count as, nothing<br />\nagainst the aid'to the teams which<br />\ncould so be rendered. To the members of the faculty, hoWever,whose<br />\ninterest in athletics, by the nature<br />\nof things,can never be quite such a<br />\npersonal one, earlier classes might<br />\nvery conceivably be highly distasteful. If they can be prevailed<br />\nupon to take the step, it will be<br />\nthe most concrete evidence of their<br />\nstrong sympathy with the undergraduates that they could render.<br />\nThe question, of course, resolves<br />\nitself into how to -have the provi-'<br />\nsion for earlier classes passed.<br />\nHere, in the opinion of THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER, the old and tried<br />\nmethod of petitioning comes again<br />\ninto its own. A request signed<br />\nby three or four hundred men<br />\nwould be bound to bring the matter into serious consideration.<br />\nOn Wednesday of this week,<br />\ntherefore, THE NEWS-LETTER will<br />\nhave a petition to the effect that<br />\nclasses be begun at 8.30 placed in<br />\ncharge of the postmaster. The<br />\nSigning of the petition, of course,<br />\nwill be entirely optional, but the<br />\neffectiveness of the request will<br />\nlargely depend upon the number<br />\nof men by whom it is endorsed.<br />\nThe Polity Club.<br /><br />\nThe formation of a club at Hopkins, constituted entirely of undergraduates, to discuss present<br />\ninternational problems is one of<br />\nthe best signs that there are still<br />\nmen in the undergraduate department who are interested in things<br />\nother than the day's assignment<br />\nin German \"'Rose or the whereabouts of the next the dansant<br />\nwhich has come into evidence for<br />\nquite a long time.<br />\nAn intelligent and earnest interest in the government of the<br />\nworld should be one of the distinguishing marks of the college<br />\nman.

D. the<br />\n1917,<br />\nJames Schouler lecturer for'<br />\nin the fifth of his series of lectures on \"International Readjustments,\" in the Civil Engineering<br />\nBuilding on Tuesday, March 20.<br />\nDr. Hill then told how this<br />\ncould and should be corrected after the war and said that what<br />\nwas lacking was an organization<br />\nof international justice. This can<br />\nbe remedied, he said, by the formation of a commonwealth of all<br />\nthe states. If such a commonwealth were formed, he explained,<br />\nthe states would still be states;<br />\nthey would retain their same government and would not be compelled to give up any of the power<br />\nthey previously possessed.<br />\n\"The real testing time of democracy,\" Dr. Hill , continued,<br />\n\"will be the moment of victory\u2014<br />\nfor victory there must be\u2014in the<br />\npresent European War. Before<br />\nthe treaty of peace is signed the<br />\ndifferent nations will have to decide between imperialism and democracy, and, awe-struck by the<br />\nmagnitude of this -war, their<br />\nchoice will be democracy. But<br />\nthis choice will not be made by<br />\nthe governments, but by an overwhelming majority of all the people in the world. If democracy<br />\nis chosen and the commonwealth<br />\nof states is formed, then there<br />\nnever again can exist such a condition of affairs as existed on August 1, 1914. On this day there<br />\nwas only one man in Europe who<br />\ncould have prevented, the ,war Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany\u2014and<br />\nhe was no longer able to control<br />\nthe powerful war-making machine<br />\nthat he had himself constructed.\"<br />\nDr. Hill stated that even since<br />\nthe beginning of the war, the internal character of the British<br />\nEmpire had been greatly changed.<br />\nAn organization of republics,<br />\nrather than an empire, is coming<br />\ninto existence in Great Britain, he<br />\nasserted. The autonomous \u2022 colonies of England sent countless<br />\nnumbers of troops to aid her, he<br />\nclaimed, because they felt that democracy itself was imperiled and<br />\nnot from any love of British imperialism. But since these internal changes have been made,<br />\nthe colonies are more at \u2022 heart<br />\nwith their mother country, and<br />\nin Canada alone an army outnumbering the combined forces of<br />\nthe Duke of Wellington, General<br />\nBlucher and Napoleon at the<br />\nBattle of 'Waterloo is now being<br />\ntrained.<br />\nGetting back to his main<br />\nsubject, Dr. Hill stated that the<br />\nfirst article in a treaty of peace<br /><br />\n5<br /><br />\nPSYCHOLOGISTS TEST INFANTS<br /><br />\nHOW THE ENDOWMENT FUND WOULD OPERATE<br />\nAt the request of THE NEWS-LETTER,the Massachusetts Mutual<br />\nLife Insurance Company has prepared a statement of the exact<br />\nmanner in which the 1917 Endowment Fund would be created.<br />\nWhile the committee appointed by President Sutton has not yet<br />\ndetermined upon the company with which the class will deal, the<br />\nfollowing provisions give a good idea of the general conditions of<br />\nthe plan.\u2014Editor.<br /><br />\n1. Each individual endowment policy is payable at maturity or<br />\nprior death direct to the trustees of the University. The individual<br />\npolicy-holder cannot change the beneficiary, borrow against the<br />\npolicy, or avail himself of any of the policy's privileges which are<br />\nall entirely under the control of the University trustees.<br />\n2. Premium notices will be sent to each policy-holder, and duplicate notices will also be sent to the University treasurer covering<br />\neach policy.<br />\n3. Thirty-one days' grace without interest charge is allowed in<br />\npayment of each premium after the first, and the University treasurer will be promptly advised of any delinquents.<br />\n4. Annual dividends are declared on all policies, and slips, showing the amount of the dividend and interest thereon credited to<br />\neach policy are sent to the University treasurer every year. Unless<br />\notherwise arranged for, these dividends are held by the company,<br />\nand improved annually at compound interest (3 per cent. guaranteed, 4% per cent. now being allowed), and on the basis of the com4 per<br />\n/<br />\npany's present dividend schedule and compound interest at 43<br />\ncent. the fund will be increased materially. This fund can also be<br />\nused at the discretion of the University in assisting any member of<br />\nthe fund who needs temporary help in paying his premiums. In<br />\naddition to this the company furnishes their automatic credit system attached to the policy whereby any premium after the first ean<br />\nbe carried by the company for a considerable time, should any member be unable to pay same when due.<br />\n5. A special disability clause is provided in this arrangement,<br />\nwhereby if any member be totally and permanently disabled, the reinajning premiums during the period of total and permanent disability will be paid by the company, without affecting the contract<br />\nin any way, nor decreasing the fund to any extent whatever..<br />\n6. The rate at age 25 is as follows:<br />\n$48.23 per annum.<br />\n$1,000<br />\n36.18 per annum.<br />\n750<br />\n')4.12 per annum.<br />\n500<br />\nThe rate at age 20 is as follows:<br />\n$1,000<br />\n$47.74 per annum.<br />\n750<br />\n35.81 per annum.<br />\n500<br />\n23.87 per annum.<br />\n7. The policy provides automatie non-forfeiture provisions after<br />\nthe first year, so that there is no possible way for an enrolled member to fail to be of benefit by joining this class fund.<br />\n8. Arrangements have been made to take care of the members of<br />\nthe class who are now members of the militia before war is declared. As this may come at any time now, the advisability of<br />\nthese men taking immediate action, if they desire to lend their aid<br />\nin this great cause, can readily be seen.<br /><br />\nshould be an invitation to all the nations in the world to enter into<br />\na commonwealth and become a<br />\npart of it.<br />\n\"And if such a commonwealth<br />\nis formed,\" Dr. Hill concluded,<br />\n\"perpetual peace will be the result.\"<br />\nThe last lecture of the series<br />\nwas given on March 22, and was<br />\non \"International Organization.\"<br />\nIn this lecture, Dr. Hill discussed<br />\nplans \u2022 for securing permanent<br />\npeace after this war.<br />\nDr. Hill started by saying that<br />\nthe world is not and never will be<br />\ngoverned entirely by pure intelligence, and that' although it is<br />\ncomparatively easy for philosophers to realize a federation of<br />\nnations, it is difficult to believe<br />\nin the practicability of ,a universal state or federation unless human nature changes. All wars,<br />\nhe said, call forth new proposals<br />\nof international peace. He went<br />\non to show how ,unjust and inef-<br /><br />\nfective these proposals have been.<br />\nImperial powers, Dr. Hill said,<br />\nwere not willing to give up their<br />\ndesires for increase in power and<br />\nwould therefore not submit to an<br />\ninternational court. Any league<br />\nor conference of nations must be<br />\nmade up at first, as a result, of a<br />\nstrong but limited group of constitutional powers who are willing to give up their national aspirations. This would not be a<br />\nnew state, but only a society of<br />\nstates, all with the same purpose<br />\n\u2014to secure peace and justice.<br />\n\u2022 An international board of trade<br />\nconciliation was also proposed by<br />\nDr. Hill as a very necessary step<br />\nin securing permanent peace. The<br />\nuse of force, said Dr. Hill, to secure business success in foreign<br />\nundeveloped fields has been the<br />\ncause of many wars and will be<br />\nthe cause of future wars, unless<br />\nthe business men of the nations<br />\ncan get together and come to<br />\nagreements whereby co-operation<br /><br />\nExperiments Being Carried on by Dr.<br />\nWatson'to Determine Appearance<br />\nof Emotions and Instincts<br />\nin Babies.<br /><br />\nProf. John Watson, of the psychology department of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University, has recently<br />\nbeen conducting experiments on<br />\ninfants in the maternity ward at<br />\nthe Hopkins Hospital. No thorough scientific work has ever<br />\nbeen done in trying to determine<br />\nthe actions of emotions and instincts in babies, and the results<br />\nof Dr. Watson's experiments may<br />\nstartle the psychological world.<br />\nThe actual work is being carried<br />\non in the psychological laboratory<br />\n.in the Phipps Clinic, where about<br />\nforty babies a month are subjected to the experiments.<br />\nThe first experiments are to discover the earliest appearance of<br />\nemotions and also the situations<br />\nwhich bring out emotions. It is<br />\nhoped that this study will lead to<br />\nthe development of methods by<br />\nwhich it will be possible to change<br />\nand break up wrong emotional attachments and to regulate certain<br />\nglands of the body that depend<br />\nupon these attachments.<br />\nTests are also being made to determine the time of the appearance of the earliest instincts, as<br />\na basis for getting an idea as to<br />\nthe vocation for which the individual would best be fitted. A record of the ages at which various<br />\ninstincts appear and at which different movements, such as co-ordinating eye and hand movements,<br />\nappear, it is hoped will give some<br />\nlight on whether the infants have<br />\nnormal brains. If the psychologists can discover by this means<br />\nwhether an infant has a normal<br />\nor a backward brain, steps could<br />\nbe taken so as to develop the child<br />\nalong lines that would improve his<br />\ncondition.<br />\nLeft and right handedness is being studied, in order to find out<br />\nwhether it is an instinct or merely the result of an accident or of<br />\nhabit. In addition, every involuntary motion of the baby from the<br />\ntime of birth is recorded.<br />\nIt has been noted that an infant, if allowed to grasp a small<br />\nstick, will involuntarily draw himself up and hang suspended from<br />\na few seconds to a minute. This<br />\ngrasping reflex continues for about<br />\nthe first four months in the normal child.<br />\nGreat care has been exercised<br />\nin the handling and testing of the<br />\ninfants. One accident has resulted and no ill health has developed<br />\nin any of the babies tested.<br />\ncan be secured in foreign trade<br />\nand commerce. This economic<br />\nmeans of preventing war is just<br />\nas important as any political<br />\nmethod that could be developed<br />\nto secure international peace and<br />\nsecurity.<br /><br />\n6<br /><br />\nTENNIS TEAM FACE HARD SEASON<br />\nGames Scheduled with Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Navy\u2014All<br />\nof Last Year's Players Back, with<br />\nSeveral New Recruits.<br /><br />\n\u2022 One of the best and most difficult schedules that any Johns<br />\nHopkins tennis team has ever<br />\nboasted of has been arranged this<br />\nyear by Manager Jacobsen.

In a<br />\nmost graphic and thrilling manner the physician-in-chief of the<br />\nAmerican hospital in Van, Turkey, narrated his experiences<br />\namong the Turkish atrocities in<br />\nthe Lake Van region up to the<br />\ntime when, unconscious from typhus fever, he was carried, slung<br />\non a litter between two mules, to<br />\na place of safety.<br />\nAfter a brief survey of how the<br />\nTurks drove the Armenians in the<br />\nVan region in flocks to be mustered into service and burned the<br />\nhouses of the deserters, and how<br />\nthey rescinded all the rights of<br />\nforeigners, except, to some extent,<br />\nof Americans, he portrayed the<br />\nattempt of the governor-general<br />\nof Van to requisition the drug<br />\nsupplies of the hospital. When<br />\nDr. Ussher refused to accede, a<br />\ncaptain and several policemen<br />\nbroke into the hospital and demanded a barrel of epsom salts,<br />\nwhich they endeavored to remove<br />\nfrom the cellar.<br />\nRealizing that it was up to him<br />\nto defend American rights, Dr.<br />\nUssher flatly refused to yield to<br />\nthe mandates of the captain.<br />\nWhen eight policemen attempted<br />\nto remove him from the trap-door<br />\nleading to the cellar, Rev.

At this moment the Russian<br />\nconsul appeared, -ordered the<br />\nTurks away, and next day compelled the governor-general to<br />\napologize to Dr. Ussher.<br />\nA thrilling description was then<br />\ngiven by Dr. Ussher of the victorious 28-day fight of the Armenians<br />\nwith the Turks, during which the<br />\nhospital buildings were perforated with cannon and rifle balls, the<br />\nRed Cross flag was shot down and<br />\nthe American flag was riddled<br />\nbulets until it fell. Before the<br />\nbattle, Dr. Ussher told the governor that he must not permit his<br />\nsoldiers to fire on American prop\u2022 erty. In spite of this, the governor ordered the guns trained on<br />\nthe hospital. All the inmates of<br />\nthe hospital miraculously escaped,<br />\nhowever, with the exception of a<br />\nlittle girl.. \"One shell,\" Dr. Usslier remarked, \"was hurled into<br />\na room containing 45 people, but<br />\nit burst harmlessly in a barrel of<br />\nwater.\"<br /><br />\nNot only is the star veteran<br />\nbaseball team of last year back<br />\npractically intact, but an abundant supply of new material has<br />\nshown up. The squad of 30 men<br />\nhas been practicing in the cage,<br />\nhaving ventured out only one day<br />\nand being driven inside again by<br />\nthe weather. They are hoping,<br />\nhowever, to be out again in a few<br />\ndays.<br />\nNext Saturday the team begins<br />\nits schedule. Sixteen games are<br />\nto be played this year, and because of the number and nearness<br />\nof the conflicts, Coach Hooper is<br />\nmuch pleased at the number of<br />\nnew pitchers. Capt.\"Jack\" Defandorf will lead this department and<br />\n\"Eggie\" Gorman will be his chief<br />\nassistant. .The new pitchers that<br />\nare showing up well are: Wood,<br />\n'20, who came from Swarthmore<br />\nHigh School; Taylor, '18, who did<br />\ngood \u2022work on the class team;<br />\nWasserman, '19, another veteran<br />\nof class battles and a \"sub\" pitcher on last year's 'Varsity; \"Jesse\"<br />\nWebb, a pitcher from Jefferson<br />\nSchool; and \"Doc\" Love, a junior.<br />\n\"Frankie\" Worthington a n d<br />\n\"Pete\" Porter will again hover<br />\nabout the second sack, and \"Hick\"<br />\nHobbs, if his studies permit, will<br />\noccupy first.<br />\nThe new men who are out for<br />\nthe infield are: Littman,from last<br />\nyear's championship team at City;<br />\nLevin, who played the hot corner<br />\nfor Maryland State; and Purcell,<br />\nthe quarterback on the football<br />\nteam. These men will give Egerton a run for his money at third<br />\nbase, although the 'Varsity thirdsacker is playing in very good<br />\nform this year. \"Dick\" Benson,<br />\nfrom City College, is out for<br />\ncatcher, and Evans, a Jefferson<br />\nSchool man, is also showing up<br />\nwell.<br />\nThe outfield will suffer from the<br />\nloss of \"Butts\" Sutton and \"Bake\"<br />\nEwing, both of whom were crack<br />\nfielders and consistently hard hitters. It is possible that Egerton<br />\nmay be shifted to the outfield<br />\nwhen Jacobsen,'18, and Sickel, of<br />\nthe championship City team, could<br />\nhelp him in filling up the gaps<br />\nleft by Ewing and Sutton.<br /><br />\nClothes for<br />\nYoung Fellows<br />\nTHE QUALITY SHOP<br />\n\"Collar-Hug\" Clothes<br /><br />\nBaltimore and Liberty Streets<br />\nSTUDENTS' NOTE BOOKS also<br />\nLOOSE LEAF NOTE BOOKS<br />\nat POPULAR PRICES**<br />\n50 Engraved Cards and Plate, Script Engraving, 70c<br />\n50 Engraved Cards from Plate,<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\n- -<br /><br />\n35c<br /><br />\nClass and Fraternity Class Pin Dies for<br />\nStationery made Free of Charge<br />\nHEADQUARTERS for CRANE'S FINE PAPERS<br /><br />\nHENDERSON'S<br />\nBaltimore's Most Popular Price Stationers<br /><br />\n316-318 W.
