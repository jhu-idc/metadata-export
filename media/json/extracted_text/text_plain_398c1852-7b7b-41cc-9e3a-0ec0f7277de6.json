Greene to set<br />\nup an anthropology department is doubly welcome.<br />\nThe addition of a new department, contemplated for<br />\nSeptember 1974, provided sufficient funding and a<br />\nchairman can both be found, should provide more<br />\nflexibility in the study of both sociology and anthropology<br />\non this campus. As President Muller noted ,this week,<br />\nproblems often arise when two disciplines are contained<br />\nwithin the same academic department. Although there will<br />\nno doubt be substantial difficulties to be overcome in the<br />\nbeginning, it appears that some needed diversity is going to<br />\nbe added to the Homewood curriculum.<br />\nThe other welcome aspect of this apparent decision<br />\n(apparent because only one member of the Council would<br />\ncomment on it) is that it shows a willingness on the part of<br />\nthe Council to consider favorably innovative programs in<br />\nthe academic area. It was only two years ago that the<br />\nCouncil rejected a proposed University year for ACTION<br />\nprogram because students would receive both academic<br />\ncredit and pay for work in the community. They also<br />\ncommented that the proposal was too poorly defined. By<br />\ntheir action this week, the Council has shown a new<br />\nwillingness to consider innovative programs with an open<br />\nmind. Although the department proposal still must be<br />\napproved by the Board of Trustees, the Council deserves<br />\ncongratulation for its favorable reaction to the new idea.<br />\n<br />\nff<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nNews-Letter reports to the<br />\ncontrary, the Department of<br />\nClassics is indeed offering an<br />\nintersession course, entitled<br />\n\"Readings from Herodotus\".

We are supposed to<br />\ndevelop a sense of<br />\nresponsibility, creativity,<br />\nemotional stability, competency<br />\nin the area of study and certain<br />\nclearly defined ideas about the<br />\nconduct of our studies and<br />\nprivate affairs. In essence, we<br />\nare supposed to complete the<br />\nprocess of becoming<br />\nfunctioning adult individuals.<br />\nIt follows in line therefore,<br />\nthat there can be no logical and<br />\nintelligent reason why the<br />\nOffice of Academic<br />\nProgramming (or whatever<br />\noffice in this vast maze of<br />\nbureaucracy is responsible for<br />\nacademic programming) to<br />\nrequire the signature of<br />\nacademic faculty advisors to<br />\nhave student programs cleared<br />\nthrough its Office.<br />\nSince most of the advisors<br />\nwill comply with a students<br />\n[sic] wishes as far as course<br />\nchoices are concerned, this<br />\nprocess seems, at most,<br />\nobnoxiously perfunctory.<br />\nThat is not to say the system<br />\nof advisors is obsolete, there is<br />\nwisdom in such a system<br />\nindeed. What is meant, is that<br />\nan advisor should be just that:<br />\nan advisor. He should not<br />\nconstitute some authoritarian<br />\nfigure, the existence of which<br />\nquestions the student's<br />\ncompetency in deciding things<br />\nrelevant to his own welfare. The<br />\nadvisor should not be another<br />\nhassle along the road to<br />\nsatisfying the need to exercise<br />\none's intellectual curiosity.<br />\nComing from a state where I<br />\nam my own recognized legal<br />\nguardian, I find myself intensely<br />\noffended and astoundingly<br />\nconfused. I imagine there are<br />\nother students such as myself<br />\nwho feel confident of our<br />\nability to make decisions. We<br />\nhave grown up. When shall<br />\nBaltimore and Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity grow up to meet our<br />\nneeds?<br />\n<br />\nDecember 4, some response<br />\nmust be made to his rather<br />\nstrong opinions. Admittedly,<br />\nafter \u00b0lily three months at JHU,<br />\nmy impressions are, at best,<br />\nsuperficial, but I have explored<br />\nenough of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and have had<br />\nenough contact with other<br />\ncolleges to be reasonably aware<br />\nof general attitudes and<br />\nopinions.<br />\nMr. Shepanek seems to take<br />\ngreat delight in putting down<br />\nthe academic atmosphere of this<br />\nuniversity, both in the<br />\nclassroom and out, yet some of<br />\nthe allegations he makes<br />\ntowards Hopkins ate also<br />\n<br />\nvv.-college, in another article on the<br />\nvery same page. In comparison<br />\n<br />\nto this college and others like it,<br />\nHopkins is described as \"the<br />\nhollowed [sic] halls of<br />\nhighbrow, sub-Ivy league<br />\neducation.\" The fact is that<br />\npoor lectures, non-relevant<br />\ncourses, and pressure due to<br />\ngrading systems are common<br />\ncomplaints of nearly every<br />\ncollege. As for the unfair<br />\ngeneralizations 'about the<br />\nadministration, the faculty, and<br />\nthe students, besides grossly<br />\ndistorting the facts and<br />\nindulging in some insulting<br />\nname calling, he has taken issues<br />\nwhich could definitely use some<br />\nhonest criticism and has written<br />\nthem off as hopeless. Yes,<br />\nunfortunately, the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity has its problems,<br />\nmost institutions do, but there<br />\nare always the individuals like<br />\nMr. Shepanek, who find it easier<br />\nto be a cynic than to try and<br />\nchange what they find wrong.<br />\nThomas Pressley<br />\n<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nBruce Albert \u2022 Shepanek's<br />\nfarewell tirade in the December<br />\n4 issue contains some errors of<br />\nfact about his age (16 on<br />\nSeptember 5, not<br />\nmid-Deeember), number of<br />\ncredits earned (69 rather than<br />\n80), and number of years at<br />\nHopkins (since September of<br />\n1972, not two years). Worse,<br />\nthough, it may give readers the<br />\nimpression that students who<br />\nenter college several years<br />\nearlier than average usually<br />\nreact as he has by dropping out.<br />\nFrom research and experience<br />\nin our Study of Mathematically<br />\nand Scientifically Precocious<br />\nYouth (SMSPY)\u2014in which<br />\nBruce was not a participant\u2014<br />\nwe know that his case is<br />\natypical.<br />\nBruce was graduated from a<br />\nhigh school in Virginia at age<br />\n14. He entered Hopkins as a<br />\nregular full-time residential<br />\nstudent with advanced standing<br />\njust about the time he became<br />\n15. By contrast, in the fall of<br />\n1969 Joseph Bates became a<br />\nfull-time day student while still<br />\n13 years old after completing<br />\nCharles Henderson<br />\nonly the eighth grade.

Dylan<br />\nand Band will have 40<br />\nperformances in 25 cities from<br />\nJanuary 3 to February 16.<br />\nThere is wide speculation as to<br />\nthe reason for such a tour. Does<br />\nDylan need the money? Is it a<br />\npromotion hype for his and The<br />\nBand's newly released albums?<br />\nReally, it should make no<br />\ndifference. Dylan is going on<br />\ntour, like never before, and the<br />\ntime is unquestionably right,<br />\nWhile screaming<br />\nthe<br />\nteenyboppers idolize<br />\nself-indulgent antics of Alice<br />\nCooper and his ilk, the news<br />\n<br />\nthat Dylan and the Band will<br />\ntour provides a desperately<br />\nneeded relief for his mature<br />\nfollowing of those who have so<br />\nlong listened to his music. The<br />\nthought of seeing Dylan in<br />\nconcert is one of the few<br />\nnotions which deservedly can<br />\nkeep us from \"wallowing in<br />\nWatergate.\" Dylan is of course<br />\nonly a human being, but what<br />\nhe symbolizes, as so often<br />\nhappens, eclipses the man<br />\nhimself. Dylan's re-emergence,<br />\nto those who have followed his<br />\ncareer and hoped so long for it,<br />\ncan only be seen as a hallowed<br />\nevent.<br />\nIn a recent article in Rolling<br />\nStone, Ralph J. Gleason had<br />\nthese insightful words to say<br />\nabout the import of Dylan on<br />\nAmerica:<br />\n\"Dylan's songs and the<br />\npressures he generated had more<br />\nto do with creating a society in<br />\nwhich it was possible for Nixon<br />\nto fuck up and be caught at it<br />\nand threatened with<br />\nimpeachment, than politicos are<br />\nlikely to believe.<br />\n\"I think he had a lot to do<br />\nwith it because he changed the<br />\nway we thought and through<br />\nthat, the way others thought.\"<br />\nThings happen as they do and<br />\npeople do their best to explain<br />\nthem. Well, Richard Nixon has<br />\nseen his better days, Bob Dylan<br />\nis going on tour, and as Comet<br />\nKohoutek rises to glory in early<br />\nJanuary, 1974 may be a very<br />\ngood year.<br />\n<br />\nMay of 1973 at age 177/12 and<br />\nan M.S. degree in electrical<br />\nengineering (specializing in<br />\ncomputer science) three months<br />\nlater.

Capon. The land sits<br />\nbetween Barclay Street,<br />\nGreen mount Avenue, and<br />\nThirty-second street.<br />\nCapon, a New York State Real<br />\nEstate developer reportedly<br />\nchose the unique Waverly site<br />\nbecause the downtown area is<br />\ntoo crowded with hotels, and the<br />\nland is very close to both the<br />\nHopkins Homewood campus and<br />\nthe Union Memorial Hcspitab.<br />\nThe hotel, which was designed<br />\nby architect Leo J. D'Aleo would<br />\ncontain 150 hotel rooms, 100<br />\napartments, 65,000 square feet<br />\nof office space, and a garage for<br />\nover 500 cars. The proposed<br />\nhotel would be faced in glass, and<br />\nrange from five to fourteen<br />\nstories in height.<br />\nThose who are opposed to the<br />\nconstruction of the hotel are<br />\nmainly residents of the Waverly<br />\narea. Two basic arguments are<br />\n<br />\ngiven by the residents: the hotel<br />\nwould create both new traffic<br />\nand parking problems for the<br />\nWaverly area. Traffic problems<br />\nare given major importance by<br />\nthe Waverly residents, and the<br />\nheight of the hotel would<br />\ncontrast with two-story rowhouses<br />\nwhich characterize this part of<br />\nBaltimore city.<br />\nThe opposition consists,<br />\nbasically, of two groups: the<br />\nPeople's Free Medical Clinic and<br />\nthe Anti-Hotel committee.<br />\n\"The Anti-Hotel Committee is<br />\nbusy collecting petitions and has<br />\nover 600 signed petitions,\" noted<br />\nG. Whitman, resident of the<br />\nWaverly area and opposer of the<br />\nhotel's construction.<br />\n\"Although the constructor is<br />\nlegally<br />\n2 to build the hotel,<br />\nsince he owns the land and the<br />\narea is zoned for cornr,Prcial use,<br />\nthe devleoper needs Brentwood<br />\nAvenue to build the hotel, and<br />\ntiie city owns Brentwood.<br />\nTherefore, we are going to try to<br />\nprevent the city froni closing off<br />\nBrentwood Street,\" stated<br />\nWhitman.<br />\nAccording to a November 7<br />\nrelease by the Anti-Hotel<br />\nCommittee, if the developer<br />\ncannot<br />\nhave the street, \"the<br />\nAnti-Hotel Committee feels he<br />\nmay abandon his plans for the<br />\nproperty and offer it for sale. If<br />\nthis happens, the Committee will<br />\nrequest that Baltimore City buy<br />\nit in order to use it for a<br />\nstructure of a project more in<br />\nkeeping with the residents' needs<br />\nand wants.\"<br />\nWaverly residents also fear that<br />\nthe hotel would cause the<br />\nproperty value of the homes to<br />\ndecrease in value.<br />\n\"The property values of the<br />\nWaverly area have increased in<br />\nthe last few years, and according<br />\nto a local real estate office,<br />\nconstruction of the hotel would<br />\ndecrease the property value of<br />\nthe area,\" added Whitman.<br />\n<br />\nWhitman also stated residents<br />\nare meeting once a week and<br />\nadded that Tuesday night's<br />\nmeeting was a partial success for<br />\nthe residents, because it showed<br />\nhow strong the opposition to the<br />\nhotel really was.<br />\n\"At the meeting there were<br />\ntwo hundred and fifty people,<br />\nalong with three second district<br />\ncouncilmen. I think the meeting<br />\ncaused the councilmen to take<br />\nanother look at the problem,\"<br />\nconcluded Whitman.<br />\nAccording to Fitzpatrick,<br />\n<br />\nago,\" stated Fitzpatrick.<br />\nFitzpatrick also indicated<br />\nthere was little the resident could<br />\ndo to oppose the construction.<br />\n\"The developer has the zoning<br />\nprivileges, and legally owns the<br />\nland. All he has to do is obtain<br />\nthe necessary permits from the<br />\nDepartment of Housing,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick noted.<br />\n\"The only confusing part,<br />\nwhich the residents do not<br />\ncompletely understand, is the<br />\nclosing of Brentwood street. If<br />\nthe developer cannot obtain the<br />\n<br />\nselling Brentwood Street.<br />\nPublicly, Hopkins is taking no<br />\nside, or becoming involved in any<br />\nway in this controversy.<br />\n\"There is no indication that<br />\nthe university will rent space or<br />\nuse any of the hotel facilities,<br />\nand I see no advantage to it,\"<br />\nstated Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"We'll have our guests stay in<br />\nthe regular place which we have<br />\nbeen using, such as the hotel in<br />\nthe downtown area or in one of<br />\nthe university -owned<br />\napartments,\" added Fitzpatrick.<br />\n<br />\n-<br />\n<br />\nhowever, the aim of the hotel is<br />\nto improve, not deteriorate the<br />\nWaverly area.<br />\n\"Consideration for the hotel<br />\nbegan several years ago, when an<br />\neffort was begun to upgrade the<br />\narea,\" stated Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"However, the problem is a<br />\ncomplex one, and at the present<br />\ntime there is no clear consensus.<br />\nIn any event, I will refer to the<br />\ncommunity organ and vote on<br />\nevery issue, according to howthe<br />\npeople feel,\" added Fitzpatrick.<br />\nAccording to Fitzpatrick, the<br />\nlast rezoning of the area took<br />\nplace in 1971.<br />\n\"The 1971 rezoning, however,<br />\nonly parallelled what had been<br />\nthere. That whole area was zoned<br />\nfor commercial use twenty years<br />\n<br />\nstreet then the parking facilities<br />\nwill be put on the other side of<br />\nthe highrise. If, however, the<br />\ndeveloper can buy the additional<br />\nland, then it would be possible to<br />\nput the parking facilities<br />\nunderground, and provide more<br />\nspace on the street. Whether<br />\nBrentwood is sold or not,<br />\nhowever, the developer has the<br />\nlegal right and ability to<br />\nconstruct the highrise<br />\ncomplex,\"noted Fitzpatrick.<br />\nHe claimed this was one of the<br />\nreasons for the Tuesday night<br />\nmeetings, to make this point<br />\nclear to the residents. As<br />\nevidence of the new release,<br />\nhowever, most residents at this<br />\ntime believe they can stop the<br />\nhotel by preventing the city from<br />\n<br />\nIn addition, Fitzpatrick<br />\nbelieved the hotel would have no<br />\nadverse effects on the area.<br />\n\"Although I have no evidence<br />\nof any kind that the<br />\nneighborhood's property values<br />\nwould decrease, I have no<br />\nindication the hotel would<br />\nadversely affect the area,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick noted.<br />\nAt the present time, there<br />\nappear to be many popular<br />\nmisconceptions of the hotel in<br />\nthe area, yet the city will take no<br />\naction until the matter is cleared<br />\nwith the Waverly residents<br />\naccording to Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"I don't know where it goes<br />\nfrom here, it is a very emotional<br />\nand complex issue,\" Fitzpatrick<br />\nconcluded.<br />\n<br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\nPEKING GARDEN<br />\n10% OFF TO STUDENTS<br />\n<br />\nChinese Restaurant<br />\n2410 E.

Greene to set<br />\nup an anthropology department is doubly welcome.<br />\nThe addition of a new department, contemplated for<br />\nSeptember 1974, provided sufficient funding and a<br />\nchairman can both be found, should provide more<br />\nflexibility in the study of both sociology and anthropology<br />\non this campus. As President Muller noted ,this week,<br />\nproblems often arise when two disciplines are contained<br />\nwithin the same academic department. Although there will<br />\nno doubt be substantial difficulties to be overcome in the<br />\nbeginning, it appears that some needed diversity is going to<br />\nbe added to the Homewood curriculum.<br />\nThe other welcome aspect of this apparent decision<br />\n(apparent because only one member of the Council would<br />\ncomment on it) is that it shows a willingness on the part of<br />\nthe Council to consider favorably innovative programs in<br />\nthe academic area. It was only two years ago that the<br />\nCouncil rejected a proposed University year for ACTION<br />\nprogram because students would receive both academic<br />\ncredit and pay for work in the community. They also<br />\ncommented that the proposal was too poorly defined. By<br />\ntheir action this week, the Council has shown a new<br />\nwillingness to consider innovative programs with an open<br />\nmind. Although the department proposal still must be<br />\napproved by the Board of Trustees, the Council deserves<br />\ncongratulation for its favorable reaction to the new idea.<br /><br />\nff<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nNews-Letter reports to the<br />\ncontrary, the Department of<br />\nClassics is indeed offering an<br />\nintersession course, entitled<br />\n\"Readings from Herodotus\". It<br />\nis open to any member of the<br />\nUniversity community who has<br />\nhad at least one semester of<br />\nancient Greek or the equivalent.<br />\nFurther information can be<br />\nobtained from me in Gilman<br />\n102.<br />\nThis class continues a<br />\nDepartment traditiOn of giving<br />\nan in tersession course every<br />\nyear. In past years the<br />\nDepartment has presented<br />\nograrns<br /><br />\nandel\\t<br /><br />\nCOT=tly<br /><br />\nRobert Boughner<br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nIt seems to me that coming<br />\nto college is not only a learning<br />\nexperience, but also a maturing<br />\nexperience. We are supposed to<br />\ndevelop a sense of<br />\nresponsibility, creativity,<br />\nemotional stability, competency<br />\nin the area of study and certain<br />\nclearly defined ideas about the<br />\nconduct of our studies and<br />\nprivate affairs. In essence, we<br />\nare supposed to complete the<br />\nprocess of becoming<br />\nfunctioning adult individuals.<br />\nIt follows in line therefore,<br />\nthat there can be no logical and<br />\nintelligent reason why the<br />\nOffice of Academic<br />\nProgramming (or whatever<br />\noffice in this vast maze of<br />\nbureaucracy is responsible for<br />\nacademic programming) to<br />\nrequire the signature of<br />\nacademic faculty advisors to<br />\nhave student programs cleared<br />\nthrough its Office.<br />\nSince most of the advisors<br />\nwill comply with a students<br />\n[sic] wishes as far as course<br />\nchoices are concerned, this<br />\nprocess seems, at most,<br />\nobnoxiously perfunctory.<br />\nThat is not to say the system<br />\nof advisors is obsolete, there is<br />\nwisdom in such a system<br />\nindeed. What is meant, is that<br />\nan advisor should be just that:<br />\nan advisor. He should not<br />\nconstitute some authoritarian<br />\nfigure, the existence of which<br />\nquestions the student's<br />\ncompetency in deciding things<br />\nrelevant to his own welfare. The<br />\nadvisor should not be another<br />\nhassle along the road to<br />\nsatisfying the need to exercise<br />\none's intellectual curiosity.<br />\nComing from a state where I<br />\nam my own recognized legal<br />\nguardian, I find myself intensely<br />\noffended and astoundingly<br />\nconfused. I imagine there are<br />\nother students such as myself<br />\nwho feel confident of our<br />\nability to make decisions. We<br />\nhave grown up. When shall<br />\nBaltimore and Johns Hopkins<br />\nUniversity grow up to meet our<br />\nneeds?<br /><br />\nDecember 4, some response<br />\nmust be made to his rather<br />\nstrong opinions. Admittedly,<br />\nafter \u00b0lily three months at JHU,<br />\nmy impressions are, at best,<br />\nsuperficial, but I have explored<br />\nenough of the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity, and have had<br />\nenough contact with other<br />\ncolleges to be reasonably aware<br />\nof general attitudes and<br />\nopinions.<br />\nMr. Shepanek seems to take<br />\ngreat delight in putting down<br />\nthe academic atmosphere of this<br />\nuniversity, both in the<br />\nclassroom and out, yet some of<br />\nthe allegations he makes<br />\ntowards Hopkins ate also<br /><br />\nvv.-college, in another article on the<br />\nvery same page. In comparison<br /><br />\nto this college and others like it,<br />\nHopkins is described as \"the<br />\nhollowed [sic] halls of<br />\nhighbrow, sub-Ivy league<br />\neducation.\" The fact is that<br />\npoor lectures, non-relevant<br />\ncourses, and pressure due to<br />\ngrading systems are common<br />\ncomplaints of nearly every<br />\ncollege. As for the unfair<br />\ngeneralizations 'about the<br />\nadministration, the faculty, and<br />\nthe students, besides grossly<br />\ndistorting the facts and<br />\nindulging in some insulting<br />\nname calling, he has taken issues<br />\nwhich could definitely use some<br />\nhonest criticism and has written<br />\nthem off as hopeless. Yes,<br />\nunfortunately, the Hopkins<br />\ncommunity has its problems,<br />\nmost institutions do, but there<br />\nare always the individuals like<br />\nMr. Shepanek, who find it easier<br />\nto be a cynic than to try and<br />\nchange what they find wrong.<br />\nThomas Pressley<br /><br />\nTo the editor:<br />\nBruce Albert \u2022 Shepanek's<br />\nfarewell tirade in the December<br />\n4 issue contains some errors of<br />\nfact about his age (16 on<br />\nSeptember 5, not<br />\nmid-Deeember), number of<br />\ncredits earned (69 rather than<br />\n80), and number of years at<br />\nHopkins (since September of<br />\n1972, not two years). Worse,<br />\nthough, it may give readers the<br />\nimpression that students who<br />\nenter college several years<br />\nearlier than average usually<br />\nreact as he has by dropping out.<br />\nFrom research and experience<br />\nin our Study of Mathematically<br />\nand Scientifically Precocious<br />\nYouth (SMSPY)\u2014in which<br />\nBruce was not a participant\u2014<br />\nwe know that his case is<br />\natypical.<br />\nBruce was graduated from a<br />\nhigh school in Virginia at age<br />\n14. He entered Hopkins as a<br />\nregular full-time residential<br />\nstudent with advanced standing<br />\njust about the time he became<br />\n15. By contrast, in the fall of<br />\n1969 Joseph Bates became a<br />\nfull-time day student while still<br />\n13 years old after completing<br />\nCharles Henderson<br />\nonly the eighth grade. He<br />\nunobtrusively for four<br />\nattended<br />\nTo the editor.:<br />\nAlthough Mr. Shepanek is no years and progressed happily<br />\nlonger around to defend the with excellent grades to a B.

Dylan<br />\nand Band will have 40<br />\nperformances in 25 cities from<br />\nJanuary 3 to February 16.<br />\nThere is wide speculation as to<br />\nthe reason for such a tour. Does<br />\nDylan need the money? Is it a<br />\npromotion hype for his and The<br />\nBand's newly released albums?<br />\nReally, it should make no<br />\ndifference. Dylan is going on<br />\ntour, like never before, and the<br />\ntime is unquestionably right,<br />\nWhile screaming<br />\nthe<br />\nteenyboppers idolize<br />\nself-indulgent antics of Alice<br />\nCooper and his ilk, the news<br /><br />\nthat Dylan and the Band will<br />\ntour provides a desperately<br />\nneeded relief for his mature<br />\nfollowing of those who have so<br />\nlong listened to his music. The<br />\nthought of seeing Dylan in<br />\nconcert is one of the few<br />\nnotions which deservedly can<br />\nkeep us from \"wallowing in<br />\nWatergate.\" Dylan is of course<br />\nonly a human being, but what<br />\nhe symbolizes, as so often<br />\nhappens, eclipses the man<br />\nhimself. Dylan's re-emergence,<br />\nto those who have followed his<br />\ncareer and hoped so long for it,<br />\ncan only be seen as a hallowed<br />\nevent.<br />\nIn a recent article in Rolling<br />\nStone, Ralph J. Gleason had<br />\nthese insightful words to say<br />\nabout the import of Dylan on<br />\nAmerica:<br />\n\"Dylan's songs and the<br />\npressures he generated had more<br />\nto do with creating a society in<br />\nwhich it was possible for Nixon<br />\nto fuck up and be caught at it<br />\nand threatened with<br />\nimpeachment, than politicos are<br />\nlikely to believe.<br />\n\"I think he had a lot to do<br />\nwith it because he changed the<br />\nway we thought and through<br />\nthat, the way others thought.\"<br />\nThings happen as they do and<br />\npeople do their best to explain<br />\nthem. Well, Richard Nixon has<br />\nseen his better days, Bob Dylan<br />\nis going on tour, and as Comet<br />\nKohoutek rises to glory in early<br />\nJanuary, 1974 may be a very<br />\ngood year.<br /><br />\nMay of 1973 at age 177/12 and<br />\nan M.S. degree in electrical<br />\nengineering (specializing in<br />\ncomputer science) three months<br />\nlater. This fall Joseph is a<br />\ndoctoral candidate in computer<br />\nscience at another major<br />\nuniversity on a fellowship and<br />\nfull stipend.<br />\nAnother Hopkins student,<br />\nwho became 17 years old last<br />\nmonth, is a senior majoring in<br />\nphilosophy and working on an<br />\nhonors thesis for the<br />\nbaccalaureate. He was a<br />\ncommuting student his first<br />\nyear.

His<br />\n226.05 total broke the previous<br />\nrecord of 206.00 set on January<br />\n10, 1973 by Chris Pazandak.<br />\nOther bright spots included<br />\ndouble wins by both Eric<br />\nEngelmann and Jim( Finnerty. \u2022<br /><br />\nNevvonTER<br /><br />\nEngelmann, a freshman, captured<br />\nboth the 500 and 1000 yd.<br />\nfreestyle crowns, while Finnerty<br />\ntook the 100 yd. freestyle in<br />\n51.0 and the 200 yd. free in<br />\n1:55.4.<br />\nAlso a win in the 200 yd.<br />\nbackstroke by freshman John<br />\nDierkes and a 2nd place finish (to<br />\nEngelmann) by Jim Spiering were<br />\nperformances deserving of<br /><br />\nsports<br /><br />\nmention.

Capon. The land sits<br />\nbetween Barclay Street,<br />\nGreen mount Avenue, and<br />\nThirty-second street.<br />\nCapon, a New York State Real<br />\nEstate developer reportedly<br />\nchose the unique Waverly site<br />\nbecause the downtown area is<br />\ntoo crowded with hotels, and the<br />\nland is very close to both the<br />\nHopkins Homewood campus and<br />\nthe Union Memorial Hcspitab.<br />\nThe hotel, which was designed<br />\nby architect Leo J. D'Aleo would<br />\ncontain 150 hotel rooms, 100<br />\napartments, 65,000 square feet<br />\nof office space, and a garage for<br />\nover 500 cars. The proposed<br />\nhotel would be faced in glass, and<br />\nrange from five to fourteen<br />\nstories in height.<br />\nThose who are opposed to the<br />\nconstruction of the hotel are<br />\nmainly residents of the Waverly<br />\narea. Two basic arguments are<br /><br />\ngiven by the residents: the hotel<br />\nwould create both new traffic<br />\nand parking problems for the<br />\nWaverly area. Traffic problems<br />\nare given major importance by<br />\nthe Waverly residents, and the<br />\nheight of the hotel would<br />\ncontrast with two-story rowhouses<br />\nwhich characterize this part of<br />\nBaltimore city.<br />\nThe opposition consists,<br />\nbasically, of two groups: the<br />\nPeople's Free Medical Clinic and<br />\nthe Anti-Hotel committee.<br />\n\"The Anti-Hotel Committee is<br />\nbusy collecting petitions and has<br />\nover 600 signed petitions,\" noted<br />\nG. Whitman, resident of the<br />\nWaverly area and opposer of the<br />\nhotel's construction.<br />\n\"Although the constructor is<br />\nlegally<br />\n2 to build the hotel,<br />\nsince he owns the land and the<br />\narea is zoned for cornr,Prcial use,<br />\nthe devleoper needs Brentwood<br />\nAvenue to build the hotel, and<br />\ntiie city owns Brentwood.<br />\nTherefore, we are going to try to<br />\nprevent the city froni closing off<br />\nBrentwood Street,\" stated<br />\nWhitman.<br />\nAccording to a November 7<br />\nrelease by the Anti-Hotel<br />\nCommittee, if the developer<br />\ncannot<br />\nhave the street, \"the<br />\nAnti-Hotel Committee feels he<br />\nmay abandon his plans for the<br />\nproperty and offer it for sale. If<br />\nthis happens, the Committee will<br />\nrequest that Baltimore City buy<br />\nit in order to use it for a<br />\nstructure of a project more in<br />\nkeeping with the residents' needs<br />\nand wants.\"<br />\nWaverly residents also fear that<br />\nthe hotel would cause the<br />\nproperty value of the homes to<br />\ndecrease in value.<br />\n\"The property values of the<br />\nWaverly area have increased in<br />\nthe last few years, and according<br />\nto a local real estate office,<br />\nconstruction of the hotel would<br />\ndecrease the property value of<br />\nthe area,\" added Whitman.<br /><br />\nWhitman also stated residents<br />\nare meeting once a week and<br />\nadded that Tuesday night's<br />\nmeeting was a partial success for<br />\nthe residents, because it showed<br />\nhow strong the opposition to the<br />\nhotel really was.<br />\n\"At the meeting there were<br />\ntwo hundred and fifty people,<br />\nalong with three second district<br />\ncouncilmen. I think the meeting<br />\ncaused the councilmen to take<br />\nanother look at the problem,\"<br />\nconcluded Whitman.<br />\nAccording to Fitzpatrick,<br /><br />\nago,\" stated Fitzpatrick.<br />\nFitzpatrick also indicated<br />\nthere was little the resident could<br />\ndo to oppose the construction.<br />\n\"The developer has the zoning<br />\nprivileges, and legally owns the<br />\nland. All he has to do is obtain<br />\nthe necessary permits from the<br />\nDepartment of Housing,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick noted.<br />\n\"The only confusing part,<br />\nwhich the residents do not<br />\ncompletely understand, is the<br />\nclosing of Brentwood street. If<br />\nthe developer cannot obtain the<br /><br />\nselling Brentwood Street.<br />\nPublicly, Hopkins is taking no<br />\nside, or becoming involved in any<br />\nway in this controversy.<br />\n\"There is no indication that<br />\nthe university will rent space or<br />\nuse any of the hotel facilities,<br />\nand I see no advantage to it,\"<br />\nstated Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"We'll have our guests stay in<br />\nthe regular place which we have<br />\nbeen using, such as the hotel in<br />\nthe downtown area or in one of<br />\nthe university -owned<br />\napartments,\" added Fitzpatrick.<br /><br />\n-<br /><br />\nhowever, the aim of the hotel is<br />\nto improve, not deteriorate the<br />\nWaverly area.<br />\n\"Consideration for the hotel<br />\nbegan several years ago, when an<br />\neffort was begun to upgrade the<br />\narea,\" stated Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"However, the problem is a<br />\ncomplex one, and at the present<br />\ntime there is no clear consensus.<br />\nIn any event, I will refer to the<br />\ncommunity organ and vote on<br />\nevery issue, according to howthe<br />\npeople feel,\" added Fitzpatrick.<br />\nAccording to Fitzpatrick, the<br />\nlast rezoning of the area took<br />\nplace in 1971.<br />\n\"The 1971 rezoning, however,<br />\nonly parallelled what had been<br />\nthere. That whole area was zoned<br />\nfor commercial use twenty years<br /><br />\nstreet then the parking facilities<br />\nwill be put on the other side of<br />\nthe highrise. If, however, the<br />\ndeveloper can buy the additional<br />\nland, then it would be possible to<br />\nput the parking facilities<br />\nunderground, and provide more<br />\nspace on the street. Whether<br />\nBrentwood is sold or not,<br />\nhowever, the developer has the<br />\nlegal right and ability to<br />\nconstruct the highrise<br />\ncomplex,\"noted Fitzpatrick.<br />\nHe claimed this was one of the<br />\nreasons for the Tuesday night<br />\nmeetings, to make this point<br />\nclear to the residents. As<br />\nevidence of the new release,<br />\nhowever, most residents at this<br />\ntime believe they can stop the<br />\nhotel by preventing the city from<br /><br />\nIn addition, Fitzpatrick<br />\nbelieved the hotel would have no<br />\nadverse effects on the area.<br />\n\"Although I have no evidence<br />\nof any kind that the<br />\nneighborhood's property values<br />\nwould decrease, I have no<br />\nindication the hotel would<br />\nadversely affect the area,\"<br />\nFitzpatrick noted.<br />\nAt the present time, there<br />\nappear to be many popular<br />\nmisconceptions of the hotel in<br />\nthe area, yet the city will take no<br />\naction until the matter is cleared<br />\nwith the Waverly residents<br />\naccording to Fitzpatrick.<br />\n\"I don't know where it goes<br />\nfrom here, it is a very emotional<br />\nand complex issue,\" Fitzpatrick<br />\nconcluded.<br /><br />\nWhere to Buy It<br />\nPLACES TO EAT<br />\nPEKING GARDEN<br />\n10% OFF TO STUDENTS<br /><br />\nChinese Restaurant<br />\n2410 E.
