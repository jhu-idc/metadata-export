Or rather, to hear<br />\nwhy. Unlike so many players<br />\ntoday, Chuck isn't playing for<br />\nbucks, or for hipsters only. His<br />\nmusic is honest, to the point, not<br />\nweighted downwith funk cliches<br />\nor ponderous electronics. It<br />\ndefies classification as jazz, or<br />\npop, or even rock. It can only be<br />\ncalled a joy.<br />\nHis sound, with the quartet, is<br />\nlight and airy, with a melodicism<br />\nrare in Jazz today. Chuck's tone<br />\nis warm and rich, and his<br />\nflUgel-horn style has a leanness<br />\nakin to classic Miles Davis. His<br />\npiano plays with wit and an<br />\nharmonic insight more common<br />\nin composed music than in<br />\nimprovised.

City Council<br />\n<br />\n\fafter Carter...<br />\n<br />\nMedia and grass roots to give Harris edge in Sin City<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nIt's a world tailored for<br />\nskeptics but I'm making my<br />\nclaim before it's too late: come<br />\nJuly, Fred Harris will be the<br />\nDemocratic presidential nominee.<br />\nPerhaps this prophecy is a bit<br />\nrash, considering the problems<br />\nthat most observers seem to<br />\nthink will deflate the Harris<br />\ncampaign. The former senator<br />\nfrom Oklahoma has little money,<br />\nno national office to use as a<br />\nsoap-box, and is trailing in<br />\nname-recognition polls. Worst of<br />\nall, the media has branded Harris<br />\nas the darkest of dark horses, a<br />\nquixotic candidate strapped with<br />\nthe onus of a man whose name<br />\nprovokes shudders in Democratic<br />\ncommittee meetings: George<br />\nMcGovern. The media has<br />\ndepicted Harris as a \"lovable<br />\nlightweight,\" the court jester<br />\nwho amuses and pesters the likes<br />\nof Jimmy Carter.<br />\nBut it is the same media that<br />\nWill ultimately steer the<br />\nnomination towards Harris. The<br />\npress has watched Harris'<br />\n\u2014 gra-ss-roots \u2014 camper-style<br />\nPolitics for a , couple of years<br />\nnow, writing about his campaign<br />\nin a human-interest vein, the kind<br />\nof story that CBS News closes its<br />\n-nightly broadcast with. Harris<br />\nappears popular with the media,<br />\neven respected, yet no one has<br />\ngiven him a chance of capturing<br />\nthe Democratic nomination. But<br />\nwatch out skeptics, the tide is<br />\nabout to change. In the last<br />\nmonth, Harris has made<br />\nsurprisingly strong showings in<br />\nthe early political caucuses, his<br />\nlatest a victory in Oklahoma.<br />\nBecause Harris is everyone's<br />\nunderdog, he has the advantage<br />\nof not having to win the early<br />\nPrimaries. A second place finish<br />\nis good enough. Now, reporters<br />\nare just beginning to get behind<br />\nHarris.<br />\nMr. Morris Udall's political<br />\nfate seems to be managed by the<br />\nmedia as well. Back in November,<br />\nsyndicated columnists like Evans<br />\n<br />\nand Novak were considering the<br />\nthought that Udall, who had<br />\nbeen organizing and<br />\nbarnstorming for two years,<br />\nindeed had a very real chance for<br />\nthe nomination as well as a hefty<br />\nshare of the liberal vote. But<br />\nJanuary proved less kind to<br />\nUdall. Days before the Iowa<br />\ncaucus, difficulties in the Udall<br />\ncampaign were revealed, causing<br />\ncolumnists across the country to<br />\nrescind their former optimism.<br />\nAfter he did poorly, Udall<br />\nobituaries flooded the press,<br />\nleaving the .candidate without<br />\nmuch hope. Unless Udall can pull<br />\noff an unexpected coup in the<br />\nNew Hampshire primary, .he<br />\nmight as well start running for<br />\nCongress again.<br />\nAnd now, it looks as if the<br />\ncampaign of front-runner Jimmy<br />\nCarter will be halted before his<br />\nimage is fixed in the mind of too<br />\nmany Americans. The media has<br />\nportrayed Carter as a<br />\n:self-confident , charismatic<br />\ncandidate from the \"progressive<br />\nsouth.\" But promo can go just so<br />\nfar. As Carter is exposed more to<br />\nthe public his trip-ups increase.<br />\nTake his \"voluntary integration,<br />\nyes, forced integration, no\" flub,<br />\nor his vacillatin ;<br />\nt views on<br />\nabortion. Some journalists,<br />\nhowever, already have Carter's<br />\nnumber. Steven Brill, in<br />\nan<br />\narticle called \"The Pathetic Lies<br />\nof Jimmy Carter\" in the March<br />\nissue of Harper's<br />\nattacks the<br />\n\"liberal myth\" that surrounds<br />\nJimmy Carter. According to Brill,<br />\nCarter is as close to Wallace<br />\npolitics as one can get without<br />\nbeing leagued with Wallace<br />\nhimself. Julian Bond told Brill,<br />\n\"Jimmy Carter wouldn't be my<br />\nfirst choice for president or even<br />\nmy fifth.\"<br />\nAlexander Cockburn,<br />\ncolumnist for the Village Voice,<br />\nhas consistently maintained that<br />\nthe media has whitewashed<br />\nCarter and perpetrated his<br />\n\"liberal myth.\" Because Carter<br />\nappears less dangerous than a<br />\n<br />\nALIVE & KIWI*<br />\nWallace or Lester Maddox, most<br />\npeople's image of a southern<br />\npolitician, he is considered<br />\n\"progressive,\" the new blood of<br />\nthe Southern Democrats.<br />\nCockburn writes: \"I see that<br />\nTime, the magazine that created<br />\nJimmy Carter, has felt it<br />\nnecessary to rush to his defense,<br />\nattempting to deal optimistically<br />\nwith the amazing contradictions<br />\nin Jimmy Carter's political career<br />\nand present political postures. Of<br />\ncourse, Time, on the occasions it<br />\nhas chosen to write about Carter,<br />\nhas never conscientiously dealt<br />\nwith the serious charges about<br />\nthe man; that his gubernatorial<br />\ncampaign in 1970 was modeled<br />\non that of George Wallace and<br />\n<br />\nthat on major issues\u2014such as<br />\nnatural gas deregulation, gun<br />\ncontrol, not to mention abortion,<br />\nhe has leaped agilely from side to<br />\nside of the fence. Naturally, to<br />\ninterest groups such as Tinze, the<br />\nneed for a conservativeDemocrat<br />\nto counter Reagan or Ford is<br />\nbecoming a matter of religious<br />\nconviction rather than rational<br />\nassessment of the facts.\"<br />\nOnce the more accepted,<br />\nwidely read journalists \u2014the<br />\nRestons, Broders, Wickers\u2014start<br />\nto doubt Carter's candidacy and<br />\nexpose it for the advertising fluff<br />\nit is, the ever-smiling Carter will<br />\nbe sent back to his plantation.<br />\nWhich paves the way for Fred<br />\nHarris. Soon the \"grass roots\"<br />\n<br />\nmomentum will be spread<br />\nthroughout the country, aided by<br />\nthe media exposure that Harris<br />\nhas always needed. His<br />\nfar-reaching appeal has been<br />\nunderestimated; he's the only<br />\ncandidate who could grasp the<br />\nHopkins liberal as well as the<br />\nworking class Hampdenite. While<br />\nCarter appears to be leading in<br />\nthe New Hampshire race, a<br />\nsecond or third place finish will<br />\nput Harris in the limelight.<br />\nSo my credibility is on the<br />\nline. It seems unlikely now, but I<br />\ncan feel it. Carter will be<br />\ndiscredited, Udall wiped out,<br />\nBayh tossed aside and into Sin<br />\nCity will march Fred Harris, the<br />\nman who's just like you and me.<br />\n<br />\nqIP Give your heart to a friend,<br />\n<br />\n...from New York<br />\n,Sitat\u2022 of Pals V ovk<br />\nWA. of the<br />\nAvecis 1 Fr or.cutot<br />\n<br />\nThe World T,.\u2022 Coot,<br />\nNato Yor*.

Nadjari<br />\nMHN:n1<br />\n<br />\nFan MID<br />\n<br />\nBy JOE LOBL<br />\nBack in elementary school,<br />\nValentine's Day was a big deal.<br />\nWe'd put a cardboard box on the<br />\nside of our classroom and<br />\neveryone would drop his (or her,<br />\nin fact, mostly her) stack of cards<br />\ninto it. Of course, nobody ever<br />\nbought the cards; they were<br />\neither borrowed from your kid<br />\nsister or given to you by your<br />\nmother ('they were the cutest<br />\nlittle cards, and they were 30 for<br />\n79 cents). For an entire week<br />\nbefore the big day, we would<br />\ndecorate the room with hearts<br />\nand cupids, managing to create<br />\n'the cutest little heart-shaped<br />\npaper doilies' that we could<br />\nscratch our names onto and bring<br />\nhome to Mom. I have to admit<br />\nthat the girls did get into<br />\ndecorating much more than the<br />\nguys, but even the roughest and<br />\ntoughest of'the gang' had to find<br />\nsome kind of card to give to his<br />\nmother. Besides, the money he<br />\nsaved by creating his own could<br />\nalways be used for other, more<br />\nexciting things, like his first visit<br />\nto Marlboro country.<br />\n<br />\nAnd so the week would pass.<br />\nThe girls tittered every time a<br />\nguy dumped his cards into the<br />\nbox, wondering who Charlie<br />\ncould possibly be sending that<br />\nmany Valentines to. And the<br />\nguys, while trying to maintain<br />\ntheir \"nonchalant-city\" attitude,<br />\nwould still cast furtive glances at<br />\nthe cards the girls dropped i:; the<br />\ncontainer, straining their eyes to<br />\n(hopefully) see their name on an<br />\nenvelope.<br />\nThe Winner Is...<br />\nFinally, it would be time to rip<br />\nopen the box and hand out the<br />\ncards. Just like at the Academy<br />\nAwards ceremony, -our teacher<br />\nwould stand in front of the class<br />\nand dole out the cards, one by<br />\none. ('and this one goes to. . .<br />\nPaula') The people in the know,<br />\ni.e., the people who knew the<br />\nmost people, garnered the most<br />\nvalentines, but nobody really<br />\ncounted (not until you went<br />\nhome to the privacy of your own<br />\nroom, at least); I mean,<br />\neverybody got the strawberry<br />\ncupcakes with red-hots sprinkled<br />\non top.<br />\n<br />\nThings are so much different<br />\nnow. Tomorrow is not<br />\nValentine's Day, but the day<br />\nafter Friday the 13th. 1 received<br />\nmy first Valentine of the year<br />\nyesterday and, you guessed it, it<br />\nwas from my mother (her<br />\ninscription, \"Your secret<br />\nadmirer\" didn't fool me). I<br />\nhaven't sent any Valentines<br />\neither: I've been so uninspired.<br />\nAll Heart<br />\nWhen 1 mention cutting out<br />\npaper hearts to my friends, they<br />\njust laugh and remind me that<br />\nthe traditional heart-shape is all<br />\nwrong; The heart is a bloody<br />\nblob of muscle, they say,<br />\nthrobbing not from love's<br />\nexpectations but because it has<br />\nto pump nutrients around my<br />\nbody. It has a job and a function<br />\nand it pulls all-nighters every<br />\nnight and never rests. I try not to<br />\nlisten to them, but there are<br />\nlimits to my endurance.

It is<br />\nthe feeling of the Student<br />\nCouncil Education Committee<br />\nthat this proposal be<br />\nunanimously defeated for the<br />\n<br />\nfollowing reasons:<br />\n1) Undergraduate competition<br />\nis, to say the least, already<br />\nintense. The use of pluses and<br />\nminuses would only serve to<br />\nincrease competition to the point<br />\nof absurdity. One can easily<br />\nimagine hoards of<br />\npre-professionals striving to<br />\nachieve A's while avoiding A-'s.<br />\n2) An obvious result of an<br />\nincrease in competition is an<br />\nincrease in the desire to have<br />\nfinal grades altered, and papers<br />\nand tests regraded. Hopkins<br />\n<br />\nSPRING<br />\n<br />\nfaculty will surely attest to the<br />\nfact that under the present<br />\nsystem there are an lexorbitant<br />\nnumber of requests to have C's<br />\nchanged to B's or B's changed to<br />\nA's. Faculty should seriously<br />\nconsider whether they are willing<br />\nto be confronted by an even<br />\nlarger number of students<br />\nrequesting the addition and<br />\nremovals of pluses and minuses.<br />\n3) Increased competition and<br />\nincreased desire for grade changes<br />\nmay result in a decline in the<br />\nlevel of academic integrity.

City Council<br /><br />\nafter Carter...<br /><br />\nMedia and grass roots to give Harris edge in Sin City<br />\nBy RUSS SMITH<br />\nIt's a world tailored for<br />\nskeptics but I'm making my<br />\nclaim before it's too late: come<br />\nJuly, Fred Harris will be the<br />\nDemocratic presidential nominee.<br />\nPerhaps this prophecy is a bit<br />\nrash, considering the problems<br />\nthat most observers seem to<br />\nthink will deflate the Harris<br />\ncampaign. The former senator<br />\nfrom Oklahoma has little money,<br />\nno national office to use as a<br />\nsoap-box, and is trailing in<br />\nname-recognition polls. Worst of<br />\nall, the media has branded Harris<br />\nas the darkest of dark horses, a<br />\nquixotic candidate strapped with<br />\nthe onus of a man whose name<br />\nprovokes shudders in Democratic<br />\ncommittee meetings: George<br />\nMcGovern. The media has<br />\ndepicted Harris as a \"lovable<br />\nlightweight,\" the court jester<br />\nwho amuses and pesters the likes<br />\nof Jimmy Carter.<br />\nBut it is the same media that<br />\nWill ultimately steer the<br />\nnomination towards Harris. The<br />\npress has watched Harris'<br />\n\u2014 gra-ss-roots \u2014 camper-style<br />\nPolitics for a , couple of years<br />\nnow, writing about his campaign<br />\nin a human-interest vein, the kind<br />\nof story that CBS News closes its<br />\n-nightly broadcast with. Harris<br />\nappears popular with the media,<br />\neven respected, yet no one has<br />\ngiven him a chance of capturing<br />\nthe Democratic nomination. But<br />\nwatch out skeptics, the tide is<br />\nabout to change. In the last<br />\nmonth, Harris has made<br />\nsurprisingly strong showings in<br />\nthe early political caucuses, his<br />\nlatest a victory in Oklahoma.<br />\nBecause Harris is everyone's<br />\nunderdog, he has the advantage<br />\nof not having to win the early<br />\nPrimaries. A second place finish<br />\nis good enough. Now, reporters<br />\nare just beginning to get behind<br />\nHarris.<br />\nMr. Morris Udall's political<br />\nfate seems to be managed by the<br />\nmedia as well. Back in November,<br />\nsyndicated columnists like Evans<br /><br />\nand Novak were considering the<br />\nthought that Udall, who had<br />\nbeen organizing and<br />\nbarnstorming for two years,<br />\nindeed had a very real chance for<br />\nthe nomination as well as a hefty<br />\nshare of the liberal vote. But<br />\nJanuary proved less kind to<br />\nUdall. Days before the Iowa<br />\ncaucus, difficulties in the Udall<br />\ncampaign were revealed, causing<br />\ncolumnists across the country to<br />\nrescind their former optimism.<br />\nAfter he did poorly, Udall<br />\nobituaries flooded the press,<br />\nleaving the .candidate without<br />\nmuch hope. Unless Udall can pull<br />\noff an unexpected coup in the<br />\nNew Hampshire primary, .he<br />\nmight as well start running for<br />\nCongress again.<br />\nAnd now, it looks as if the<br />\ncampaign of front-runner Jimmy<br />\nCarter will be halted before his<br />\nimage is fixed in the mind of too<br />\nmany Americans. The media has<br />\nportrayed Carter as a<br />\n:self-confident , charismatic<br />\ncandidate from the \"progressive<br />\nsouth.\" But promo can go just so<br />\nfar. As Carter is exposed more to<br />\nthe public his trip-ups increase.<br />\nTake his \"voluntary integration,<br />\nyes, forced integration, no\" flub,<br />\nor his vacillatin ;<br />\nt views on<br />\nabortion. Some journalists,<br />\nhowever, already have Carter's<br />\nnumber. Steven Brill, in<br />\nan<br />\narticle called \"The Pathetic Lies<br />\nof Jimmy Carter\" in the March<br />\nissue of Harper's<br />\nattacks the<br />\n\"liberal myth\" that surrounds<br />\nJimmy Carter. According to Brill,<br />\nCarter is as close to Wallace<br />\npolitics as one can get without<br />\nbeing leagued with Wallace<br />\nhimself. Julian Bond told Brill,<br />\n\"Jimmy Carter wouldn't be my<br />\nfirst choice for president or even<br />\nmy fifth.\"<br />\nAlexander Cockburn,<br />\ncolumnist for the Village Voice,<br />\nhas consistently maintained that<br />\nthe media has whitewashed<br />\nCarter and perpetrated his<br />\n\"liberal myth.\" Because Carter<br />\nappears less dangerous than a<br /><br />\nALIVE &amp; KIWI*<br />\nWallace or Lester Maddox, most<br />\npeople's image of a southern<br />\npolitician, he is considered<br />\n\"progressive,\" the new blood of<br />\nthe Southern Democrats.<br />\nCockburn writes: \"I see that<br />\nTime, the magazine that created<br />\nJimmy Carter, has felt it<br />\nnecessary to rush to his defense,<br />\nattempting to deal optimistically<br />\nwith the amazing contradictions<br />\nin Jimmy Carter's political career<br />\nand present political postures. Of<br />\ncourse, Time, on the occasions it<br />\nhas chosen to write about Carter,<br />\nhas never conscientiously dealt<br />\nwith the serious charges about<br />\nthe man; that his gubernatorial<br />\ncampaign in 1970 was modeled<br />\non that of George Wallace and<br /><br />\nthat on major issues\u2014such as<br />\nnatural gas deregulation, gun<br />\ncontrol, not to mention abortion,<br />\nhe has leaped agilely from side to<br />\nside of the fence. Naturally, to<br />\ninterest groups such as Tinze, the<br />\nneed for a conservativeDemocrat<br />\nto counter Reagan or Ford is<br />\nbecoming a matter of religious<br />\nconviction rather than rational<br />\nassessment of the facts.\"<br />\nOnce the more accepted,<br />\nwidely read journalists \u2014the<br />\nRestons, Broders, Wickers\u2014start<br />\nto doubt Carter's candidacy and<br />\nexpose it for the advertising fluff<br />\nit is, the ever-smiling Carter will<br />\nbe sent back to his plantation.<br />\nWhich paves the way for Fred<br />\nHarris. Soon the \"grass roots\"<br /><br />\nmomentum will be spread<br />\nthroughout the country, aided by<br />\nthe media exposure that Harris<br />\nhas always needed. His<br />\nfar-reaching appeal has been<br />\nunderestimated; he's the only<br />\ncandidate who could grasp the<br />\nHopkins liberal as well as the<br />\nworking class Hampdenite. While<br />\nCarter appears to be leading in<br />\nthe New Hampshire race, a<br />\nsecond or third place finish will<br />\nput Harris in the limelight.<br />\nSo my credibility is on the<br />\nline. It seems unlikely now, but I<br />\ncan feel it. Carter will be<br />\ndiscredited, Udall wiped out,<br />\nBayh tossed aside and into Sin<br />\nCity will march Fred Harris, the<br />\nman who's just like you and me.<br /><br />\nqIP Give your heart to a friend,<br /><br />\n...from New York<br />\n,Sitat\u2022 of Pals V ovk<br />\nWA. of the<br />\nAvecis 1 Fr or.cutot<br /><br />\nThe World T,.\u2022 Coot,<br />\nNato Yor*.

Nadjari<br />\nMHN:n1<br /><br />\nFan MID<br /><br />\nBy JOE LOBL<br />\nBack in elementary school,<br />\nValentine's Day was a big deal.<br />\nWe'd put a cardboard box on the<br />\nside of our classroom and<br />\neveryone would drop his (or her,<br />\nin fact, mostly her) stack of cards<br />\ninto it. Of course, nobody ever<br />\nbought the cards; they were<br />\neither borrowed from your kid<br />\nsister or given to you by your<br />\nmother ('they were the cutest<br />\nlittle cards, and they were 30 for<br />\n79 cents). For an entire week<br />\nbefore the big day, we would<br />\ndecorate the room with hearts<br />\nand cupids, managing to create<br />\n'the cutest little heart-shaped<br />\npaper doilies' that we could<br />\nscratch our names onto and bring<br />\nhome to Mom. I have to admit<br />\nthat the girls did get into<br />\ndecorating much more than the<br />\nguys, but even the roughest and<br />\ntoughest of'the gang' had to find<br />\nsome kind of card to give to his<br />\nmother. Besides, the money he<br />\nsaved by creating his own could<br />\nalways be used for other, more<br />\nexciting things, like his first visit<br />\nto Marlboro country.<br /><br />\nAnd so the week would pass.<br />\nThe girls tittered every time a<br />\nguy dumped his cards into the<br />\nbox, wondering who Charlie<br />\ncould possibly be sending that<br />\nmany Valentines to. And the<br />\nguys, while trying to maintain<br />\ntheir \"nonchalant-city\" attitude,<br />\nwould still cast furtive glances at<br />\nthe cards the girls dropped i:; the<br />\ncontainer, straining their eyes to<br />\n(hopefully) see their name on an<br />\nenvelope.<br />\nThe Winner Is...<br />\nFinally, it would be time to rip<br />\nopen the box and hand out the<br />\ncards. Just like at the Academy<br />\nAwards ceremony, -our teacher<br />\nwould stand in front of the class<br />\nand dole out the cards, one by<br />\none. ('and this one goes to. . .<br />\nPaula') The people in the know,<br />\ni.e., the people who knew the<br />\nmost people, garnered the most<br />\nvalentines, but nobody really<br />\ncounted (not until you went<br />\nhome to the privacy of your own<br />\nroom, at least); I mean,<br />\neverybody got the strawberry<br />\ncupcakes with red-hots sprinkled<br />\non top.<br /><br />\nThings are so much different<br />\nnow. Tomorrow is not<br />\nValentine's Day, but the day<br />\nafter Friday the 13th. 1 received<br />\nmy first Valentine of the year<br />\nyesterday and, you guessed it, it<br />\nwas from my mother (her<br />\ninscription, \"Your secret<br />\nadmirer\" didn't fool me). I<br />\nhaven't sent any Valentines<br />\neither: I've been so uninspired.<br />\nAll Heart<br />\nWhen 1 mention cutting out<br />\npaper hearts to my friends, they<br />\njust laugh and remind me that<br />\nthe traditional heart-shape is all<br />\nwrong; The heart is a bloody<br />\nblob of muscle, they say,<br />\nthrobbing not from love's<br />\nexpectations but because it has<br />\nto pump nutrients around my<br />\nbody. It has a job and a function<br />\nand it pulls all-nighters every<br />\nnight and never rests. I try not to<br />\nlisten to them, but there are<br />\nlimits to my endurance.

It is<br />\nthe feeling of the Student<br />\nCouncil Education Committee<br />\nthat this proposal be<br />\nunanimously defeated for the<br /><br />\nfollowing reasons:<br />\n1) Undergraduate competition<br />\nis, to say the least, already<br />\nintense. The use of pluses and<br />\nminuses would only serve to<br />\nincrease competition to the point<br />\nof absurdity. One can easily<br />\nimagine hoards of<br />\npre-professionals striving to<br />\nachieve A's while avoiding A-'s.<br />\n2) An obvious result of an<br />\nincrease in competition is an<br />\nincrease in the desire to have<br />\nfinal grades altered, and papers<br />\nand tests regraded. Hopkins<br /><br />\nSPRING<br /><br />\nfaculty will surely attest to the<br />\nfact that under the present<br />\nsystem there are an lexorbitant<br />\nnumber of requests to have C's<br />\nchanged to B's or B's changed to<br />\nA's. Faculty should seriously<br />\nconsider whether they are willing<br />\nto be confronted by an even<br />\nlarger number of students<br />\nrequesting the addition and<br />\nremovals of pluses and minuses.<br />\n3) Increased competition and<br />\nincreased desire for grade changes<br />\nmay result in a decline in the<br />\nlevel of academic integrity.
