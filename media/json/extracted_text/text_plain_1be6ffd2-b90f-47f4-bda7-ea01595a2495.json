C., has provided<br />\nfor a lecture on eugenics before the<br />\nstudents of the Johns Hopkins University. In her letter making the<br />\noffer of an honorarium for this purpose, Mrs. Wilson makes use of the<br />\nfollowing language:<br />\nI believe in the value to our nation of<br />\n<br />\nEarly last Saturday morning, the<br />\nMusical Clubs of the University began their celebration of Washington's birthday by boarding the train<br />\nfor Wilmington, Del. They were<br />\nsetting out for their concert at<br />\nSalisbury, being forced to take this<br />\nround-about route because they<br />\nwere unable to make convenient<br />\nconnections via water. At Wilmington, the Eastern Shore \"flyer\"<br />\nwas waiting to receive the musicians<br />\nand to roll them into Salisbury<br />\nshortly after dinner time. The delay had sharpened the appetites of<br />\nall,. and the hotel's kitchen and pantry were almost eaten bare.<br />\nDuring the afternoon several of<br />\nthe young ladies of the town invited<br />\nthe members of the clubs to attend<br />\nan informal reception, which everyone, it goes without saying, thoroughly enjoyed.<br />\nThe concert was held in the evening in the \"armory.\" The artistic decorations showed the work of<br />\nfemale hands. The concert was enjoyed by all, and the audience, while<br />\nnot as large as might have been expected, was very appreciative. After<br />\nthe concert the chairs were quickly<br />\ndisposed of and an enjoyable dance<br />\nfollowed until the clock bells tolled<br />\nthe midnight hour.<br />\nThose who made the trip from<br />\nBaltimore were: Messrs. Gillet, Fulton, Getz, Ray, Bacchus, Paulus,<br />\nSchmeid, Bowden, White, Eiseman,<br />\nAler, Scovell, Marston, Howell,<br />\nSupplee, Spieker, Jacobs, Niles,<br />\nWeber, Schneeburger, Uhler, Coblentz, Lynch, Geissel, Gminder,<br />\nLauchheimer, Cole, Baker and Linthicum.<br />\nThe clubs will have their hands<br />\nfull during the next few days. On<br />\nthe twenty-fifth they will give a<br />\nconcert at one of the Baltimore<br />\nchurches; on the twenty-seventh<br />\nthey will give a concert and dance<br />\nat the Catonsville High School. On<br />\nFriday, March 28, the Friday after<br />\nEaster, the clubs will make a trip<br />\nto Sparrows Point and attempt to<br />\nshow the Pointers what good music<br />\nis. On April 4 the clubs are planning a concert at Forest Park.<br />\nWith a schedule such as this the<br />\nclubs should spread their fame and<br />\ncome to the end of the year with<br />\ntheir finances in thriving condition.<br />\n<br />\nAbout two hundred alumni seated<br />\naround small tables in the English<br />\ntea room, of the Belvedere last Saturday night enjoyed the most interesting of all their annual banquets yet held.<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown, president<br />\nof the Alumni Association, introduced Dr. William H. Welch, the<br />\nfirst speaker, as a man who \"though<br />\nunmarried was the father of a very<br />\nlarge family.\" \"Family,\" of course,<br />\nreferred to the graduates of the<br />\nMedical school, and these alumni, as<br />\nif catching a clue, broke out with<br />\nnine rahs for \"Popsie\" Welch in a<br />\nremarkable unison that caused much<br />\nlaughter and forced Dr. Welch to<br />\nface a smiling audience.<br />\nDr. Welch passed over this \"embarrassing introduction\" and read<br />\ntelegrams from several alumni associations containing greetings and<br />\ncongratulations. He then spoke of<br />\nthe new technical branch and said<br />\nthat the group system of studies now<br />\nfollowed in the arts and science<br />\ndepartment would no doubt be used<br />\nin the technical courses. He said<br />\nthat a prescribed course was too<br />\nrigid and an elective system too<br />\nloose. The group system followed<br />\nin the new courses, he continued,<br />\nwould give the men a satisfactory<br />\nengineering education and a certain<br />\ndegree of broadening along general<br />\nlines, a combination often omitted<br />\nin some schools.<br />\nDr. Welch stated that he did not<br />\nespecially desire the chairmanship<br />\nof the executive committee of the<br />\nUniversity, and smilingly admitted<br />\nthat Dean Griffin was bearing the<br />\ndrudgery of the work.<br />\nDr. Samuel C. Mitchell, the next<br />\nspeaker, told of the advantages<br />\nHopkins has for making an eminently successful technical school,<br />\nbecause of its geographical position;<br />\n\"able to draw,\" he said, \"the best<br />\nmen from the North and the best<br />\nfrom the South.\" He also paid the<br />\ncompliment \"that the whole scheme<br />\nof American education was jackscrewed up with the founding of<br />\nthe University in 1876.\" Dr. Mitchell told an amusing incident of a<br />\nfellow traveller he once met who<br />\nsaid that, next to the Baltimore City<br />\nCollege, Johns Hopkins was the<br />\nbest school in the city.<br />\nOmer F. Hershey's speech, a<br />\nforceful plea for more intimate relations between the University and<br />\nBaltimore, glowed with mild satire,<br />\nhumor and serious criticism. Mr.<br />\nHershey was fortified with a compendium of weighty and copious<br />\nquotations. He referred to Aristotle,<br />\nLessing, Nietzsche and Mencken's<br />\n\"Free Lance.\" He said be felt that<br />\na speech before academicians should<br />\nbulge with quotations and for that<br />\nreason he had supplied himself<br />\nplenteously. Once he ascribed a<br />\njoke to Aristotle, but later admitted that he had only done so so as<br />\nto have it appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nFebruary 24, 1913.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\n<br />\nI write the following to THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER st\u2022 that it may be a<br />\nlittle more timely than if it appeared<br />\nin the columns of its slower-footed<br />\nassociate, The Alumni Magazine.<br />\nI hardly see any reason for the<br />\nwoeful lack of recent graduates of<br />\nthe academic department for the<br />\nalumni banquet on Saturday night.<br />\nIt is true that the more recent<br />\nclasses do .not appear to be especially welcome in alumni council or<br />\ncouncils, or in any alumni affairs,<br />\nyet, nevertheless, a few at least<br />\nshould show sufficient interest to<br />\nattend the annual banquets.<br />\nI did not see (and there was none,<br />\nI am sure) a single man from the<br />\n1909, 1910 or 1911 classes, and there<br />\nwere only four from the 1912 Class.<br />\nOne thing that struck me in connection with the banquet was<br />\nthat it seemed rather discourteous<br />\nfor the speakers who followed Mr.<br />\nHershey to jump on him as they<br />\ndid after the committee had invited<br />\nhim to speak on the topic he did.<br />\nThat topic\" left a road open for<br />\nthe criticism at which they flinched.<br />\nIt seems to me that it would have<br />\nbeen more courteous to Mr. Hershey as a guest for the other speakers to have taken their medicine<br />\nlike men, whether or not they<br />\nagreed with Mr. Hershey, and not<br />\nstrike back at that particular time.<br />\n1912.<br />\n<br />\nthe teachings of eugenics, and I think<br />\nthat the first step to be taken toward the<br />\nacceptance and application of those teachings is to create a healthy public opinion<br />\nand social attitude towards them. To<br />\nthat end, I make this offer, as I can think<br />\nof no more effectual move in that direction than to have the subject fairly,<br />\nforcefully, practically, from the point of<br />\nview in their own lives, and above all<br />\nappealingly, presented to as many student bodies of the country as possible.<br />\nMy first idea was to try to get one<br />\nman who would be equipped with the<br />\nnecessary knowledge, tact and address to<br />\ntravel about and lecture before as many<br />\nstudent bodies as possible in the year,<br />\nbut I now think that a better way will<br />\nbe to have, wherevtr possible, a suitably<br />\nequipped professor in the college or university itself, who already carries weight<br />\nwith the students, work up the subject<br />\nand present it to them, thereby creating<br />\nvarious new foci of interest throughout<br />\nthe country, or stimulating existing ones.<br />\nIn cases where there might occasionally<br />\nnot happen to be in particular colleges<br />\nor universities available men for this<br />\ntask, it would be necessary to arrange to<br />\nsend someone from outside to give the<br />\nlecture. For use in such cases, and also<br />\nin order to collect the best contributions<br />\nthus made to the subject, I make it a<br />\ncondition 43, my offer that the lecture be<br />\nwritten and that it be placed at my disposal after delivery. My idea would be<br />\nthat in the case of a very good lecture,<br />\nthe lecturer would be willing, at my request, to go and deliver it again for the<br />\nsame honorarium in some other college<br />\nwhere no local man was to be had; or it<br />\nPrevious to the banquet a busi- might be printed as a pamphlet and used<br />\nness meeting was held and the re- in \"follow up work\"; or it might, at my<br />\nrequest, be delivered by someone else, of<br />\nsults of the mail vote for :the elec- course, giving credit to the<br />\nauthor; or it<br />\ntion of the Alumni Association's might possibly be placed with some periodical for publication, in which case, of<br />\nofficers announced.

C., has provided<br />\nfor a lecture on eugenics before the<br />\nstudents of the Johns Hopkins University. In her letter making the<br />\noffer of an honorarium for this purpose, Mrs. Wilson makes use of the<br />\nfollowing language:<br />\nI believe in the value to our nation of<br /><br />\nEarly last Saturday morning, the<br />\nMusical Clubs of the University began their celebration of Washington's birthday by boarding the train<br />\nfor Wilmington, Del. They were<br />\nsetting out for their concert at<br />\nSalisbury, being forced to take this<br />\nround-about route because they<br />\nwere unable to make convenient<br />\nconnections via water. At Wilmington, the Eastern Shore \"flyer\"<br />\nwas waiting to receive the musicians<br />\nand to roll them into Salisbury<br />\nshortly after dinner time. The delay had sharpened the appetites of<br />\nall,. and the hotel's kitchen and pantry were almost eaten bare.<br />\nDuring the afternoon several of<br />\nthe young ladies of the town invited<br />\nthe members of the clubs to attend<br />\nan informal reception, which everyone, it goes without saying, thoroughly enjoyed.<br />\nThe concert was held in the evening in the \"armory.\" The artistic decorations showed the work of<br />\nfemale hands. The concert was enjoyed by all, and the audience, while<br />\nnot as large as might have been expected, was very appreciative. After<br />\nthe concert the chairs were quickly<br />\ndisposed of and an enjoyable dance<br />\nfollowed until the clock bells tolled<br />\nthe midnight hour.<br />\nThose who made the trip from<br />\nBaltimore were: Messrs. Gillet, Fulton, Getz, Ray, Bacchus, Paulus,<br />\nSchmeid, Bowden, White, Eiseman,<br />\nAler, Scovell, Marston, Howell,<br />\nSupplee, Spieker, Jacobs, Niles,<br />\nWeber, Schneeburger, Uhler, Coblentz, Lynch, Geissel, Gminder,<br />\nLauchheimer, Cole, Baker and Linthicum.<br />\nThe clubs will have their hands<br />\nfull during the next few days. On<br />\nthe twenty-fifth they will give a<br />\nconcert at one of the Baltimore<br />\nchurches; on the twenty-seventh<br />\nthey will give a concert and dance<br />\nat the Catonsville High School. On<br />\nFriday, March 28, the Friday after<br />\nEaster, the clubs will make a trip<br />\nto Sparrows Point and attempt to<br />\nshow the Pointers what good music<br />\nis. On April 4 the clubs are planning a concert at Forest Park.<br />\nWith a schedule such as this the<br />\nclubs should spread their fame and<br />\ncome to the end of the year with<br />\ntheir finances in thriving condition.<br /><br />\nAbout two hundred alumni seated<br />\naround small tables in the English<br />\ntea room, of the Belvedere last Saturday night enjoyed the most interesting of all their annual banquets yet held.<br />\nDr. Thomas R. Brown, president<br />\nof the Alumni Association, introduced Dr. William H. Welch, the<br />\nfirst speaker, as a man who \"though<br />\nunmarried was the father of a very<br />\nlarge family.\" \"Family,\" of course,<br />\nreferred to the graduates of the<br />\nMedical school, and these alumni, as<br />\nif catching a clue, broke out with<br />\nnine rahs for \"Popsie\" Welch in a<br />\nremarkable unison that caused much<br />\nlaughter and forced Dr. Welch to<br />\nface a smiling audience.<br />\nDr. Welch passed over this \"embarrassing introduction\" and read<br />\ntelegrams from several alumni associations containing greetings and<br />\ncongratulations. He then spoke of<br />\nthe new technical branch and said<br />\nthat the group system of studies now<br />\nfollowed in the arts and science<br />\ndepartment would no doubt be used<br />\nin the technical courses. He said<br />\nthat a prescribed course was too<br />\nrigid and an elective system too<br />\nloose. The group system followed<br />\nin the new courses, he continued,<br />\nwould give the men a satisfactory<br />\nengineering education and a certain<br />\ndegree of broadening along general<br />\nlines, a combination often omitted<br />\nin some schools.<br />\nDr. Welch stated that he did not<br />\nespecially desire the chairmanship<br />\nof the executive committee of the<br />\nUniversity, and smilingly admitted<br />\nthat Dean Griffin was bearing the<br />\ndrudgery of the work.<br />\nDr. Samuel C. Mitchell, the next<br />\nspeaker, told of the advantages<br />\nHopkins has for making an eminently successful technical school,<br />\nbecause of its geographical position;<br />\n\"able to draw,\" he said, \"the best<br />\nmen from the North and the best<br />\nfrom the South.\" He also paid the<br />\ncompliment \"that the whole scheme<br />\nof American education was jackscrewed up with the founding of<br />\nthe University in 1876.\" Dr. Mitchell told an amusing incident of a<br />\nfellow traveller he once met who<br />\nsaid that, next to the Baltimore City<br />\nCollege, Johns Hopkins was the<br />\nbest school in the city.<br />\nOmer F. Hershey's speech, a<br />\nforceful plea for more intimate relations between the University and<br />\nBaltimore, glowed with mild satire,<br />\nhumor and serious criticism. Mr.<br />\nHershey was fortified with a compendium of weighty and copious<br />\nquotations. He referred to Aristotle,<br />\nLessing, Nietzsche and Mencken's<br />\n\"Free Lance.\" He said be felt that<br />\na speech before academicians should<br />\nbulge with quotations and for that<br />\nreason he had supplied himself<br />\nplenteously. Once he ascribed a<br />\njoke to Aristotle, but later admitted that he had only done so so as<br />\nto have it appreciated.<br /><br />\nFebruary 24, 1913.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br /><br />\nI write the following to THE<br />\nNEWS-LETTER st\u2022 that it may be a<br />\nlittle more timely than if it appeared<br />\nin the columns of its slower-footed<br />\nassociate, The Alumni Magazine.<br />\nI hardly see any reason for the<br />\nwoeful lack of recent graduates of<br />\nthe academic department for the<br />\nalumni banquet on Saturday night.<br />\nIt is true that the more recent<br />\nclasses do .not appear to be especially welcome in alumni council or<br />\ncouncils, or in any alumni affairs,<br />\nyet, nevertheless, a few at least<br />\nshould show sufficient interest to<br />\nattend the annual banquets.<br />\nI did not see (and there was none,<br />\nI am sure) a single man from the<br />\n1909, 1910 or 1911 classes, and there<br />\nwere only four from the 1912 Class.<br />\nOne thing that struck me in connection with the banquet was<br />\nthat it seemed rather discourteous<br />\nfor the speakers who followed Mr.<br />\nHershey to jump on him as they<br />\ndid after the committee had invited<br />\nhim to speak on the topic he did.<br />\nThat topic\" left a road open for<br />\nthe criticism at which they flinched.<br />\nIt seems to me that it would have<br />\nbeen more courteous to Mr. Hershey as a guest for the other speakers to have taken their medicine<br />\nlike men, whether or not they<br />\nagreed with Mr. Hershey, and not<br />\nstrike back at that particular time.<br />\n1912.<br /><br />\nthe teachings of eugenics, and I think<br />\nthat the first step to be taken toward the<br />\nacceptance and application of those teachings is to create a healthy public opinion<br />\nand social attitude towards them. To<br />\nthat end, I make this offer, as I can think<br />\nof no more effectual move in that direction than to have the subject fairly,<br />\nforcefully, practically, from the point of<br />\nview in their own lives, and above all<br />\nappealingly, presented to as many student bodies of the country as possible.<br />\nMy first idea was to try to get one<br />\nman who would be equipped with the<br />\nnecessary knowledge, tact and address to<br />\ntravel about and lecture before as many<br />\nstudent bodies as possible in the year,<br />\nbut I now think that a better way will<br />\nbe to have, wherevtr possible, a suitably<br />\nequipped professor in the college or university itself, who already carries weight<br />\nwith the students, work up the subject<br />\nand present it to them, thereby creating<br />\nvarious new foci of interest throughout<br />\nthe country, or stimulating existing ones.<br />\nIn cases where there might occasionally<br />\nnot happen to be in particular colleges<br />\nor universities available men for this<br />\ntask, it would be necessary to arrange to<br />\nsend someone from outside to give the<br />\nlecture. For use in such cases, and also<br />\nin order to collect the best contributions<br />\nthus made to the subject, I make it a<br />\ncondition 43, my offer that the lecture be<br />\nwritten and that it be placed at my disposal after delivery. My idea would be<br />\nthat in the case of a very good lecture,<br />\nthe lecturer would be willing, at my request, to go and deliver it again for the<br />\nsame honorarium in some other college<br />\nwhere no local man was to be had; or it<br />\nPrevious to the banquet a busi- might be printed as a pamphlet and used<br />\nness meeting was held and the re- in \"follow up work\"; or it might, at my<br />\nrequest, be delivered by someone else, of<br />\nsults of the mail vote for :the elec- course, giving credit to the<br />\nauthor; or it<br />\ntion of the Alumni Association's might possibly be placed with some periodical for publication, in which case, of<br />\nofficers announced.
