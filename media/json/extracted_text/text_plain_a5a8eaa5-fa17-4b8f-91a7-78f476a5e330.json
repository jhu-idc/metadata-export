With a large squad<br />\nentered, of mostly experienced men,<br />\nand four men saved for the relay<br />\nteam, the Black and Blue took one<br />\nfirst place, three seconds and three<br />\nthirds, making a total of seventeen<br />\npoints. The Meadowbrook Athletic Club was second with ten<br />\nPoints, Mount St. \u2022 Mary's third<br />\nseven points, and University of Virginia and University of Pennsylvania tied for fourth with six points<br />\neach.<br />\nThe event of highest interest for<br />\nHopkins was the one-mile relay for<br />\nthe S. A. I. A. A. indoor championship. Virginia, Hopkins and<br />\nGeorgetown entered teams, and<br />\nfinished in the order named. Virginia won by a considerable margin<br />\nin the fair time of 3 minutes 353<br />\n/<br />\n5<br />\nseconds. The interest of the race<br />\ncentered around the close fight of<br />\nthe other two teams for second<br />\nhonors. Uhler ran first for Hopkins and gained a short lead over<br />\nGeorgetown; Penniman finished a<br />\nfew feet ahead of his man, but Binford was not so fortunate, and Fred<br />\nHall started last for Hopkins with<br />\nStebbins of Georgetown some ten<br />\nyards ahead of him. Hall gained<br />\nno advantage until the last curve,<br />\nwhen he slowly crept up, and in a<br />\nSpectacular finish bested his man at<br />\nthe tape by a few feet, giving Hopkins second place.<br />\nAn object of great interest to<br />\nlovers of the sport was Ted Meredith's beautiful performance in<br />\nthe half mile. The only man at<br />\n\"scratch,\" with a large field of opponents stretched ahead of him<br />\nwithin a range of thirty yards,<br />\nMeredith started off with a spurt<br />\nand was in the middle of the bunch<br />\nin half a lap. Hutton, of Hopkins,<br />\nled the race until the last stretch,<br />\nwhen Meredith pulled into the lead<br />\nwith a wonderful spurt, in spite of<br />\nhis strong start. Gallagher, of<br />\nMount St. Mary's, also made a<br />\nstrong finish, making a close second<br />\nto Meredith, and leaving Hutton to<br />\ntake third for Hopkins. Gallagher<br />\nhad a handicap of twenty-nine Yards<br />\nand Hutton had twenty-four.<br />\nE. G.

The office itself is in<br />\nits historic evolution the outgrowth<br />\nand the product of personality. It<br />\ndepends for its usefulness and effectiveness wholly upon personality<br />\nand not at all upon authority.<br />\nJudged by the length and the security of tenure of its various incumbents at different institutions,<br />\nthe office is what would be called in<br />\nthe business world an extra-hazardous work. Disturbance relating to<br />\nit is not infrequent, and eviction<br />\nfrom it is not unknown. Nevertheless, ambition to hold it is well-nigh<br />\nuniversal among academic persons.<br />\n\"The beginnings of the modern<br />\noffice of university president are to<br />\nbe seen in the careers of Tappan,<br />\nat Michigan ; of Wayland, at<br />\nBrown, and of Anderson, at Rochester. Barnard, of Alabama and<br />\nColumbia, was probably the first to<br />\ngive to the office its significant relationship to general educational<br />\npolicy and to the philosophy of education. White, of Cornell; Gilman,<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, and Harper, of<br />\nChicago, were the first of that small<br />\nbut powerful group who have been<br />\nable to put their hands to the invigorating and inspiring task of<br />\ncreating a new institution out of an<br />\nidea. Eliot, of Harvard, is the pioneer among those whose work and<br />\npleasure it has been to put a wholly<br />\nnew and reconstructed modern<br />\nbuilding upon an old and highly<br />\nrespected foundation. It is a matter<br />\nof just pride to those who have<br />\nchosen the academic life and who<br />\nfollow it that American citizenship<br />\nand American scholarship bear upon<br />\ntheir rolls such names as these.<br />\n.\"The duties and responsibilities<br />\nof the office of university president<br />\nmay be summed up in a very few<br />\nwords.

Goodnow has presided, and he told of the great<br />\npleasure he was afforded in having<br />\nDr. Butler, his \"old personal friend<br />\nand associate,\" with him on the day.<br />\nDr. Goodnow and Dr. Butler<br />\nheaded the academic procession<br />\nwhich came slowly into the hall at<br />\no'clock. Following them were<br />\nthe trustees, the faculty in caps and<br />\ngowns, the alumni, headed by Dr.<br />\nThomas R. Brown; the graduate<br />\nstudents and the undergraduates.<br />\nAfter an invocation by President<br />\nWilliam W. Guth, of Goucher College, Dr. Goodnow introduced Dr.<br />\nButler, whose speech \"Concerning<br />\nSome Matters Academic\" was a<br />\ndefinition of the duties of a university president and professors and<br />\ntheir relation to the outside world<br />\nand the students.<br />\nAfter the address, Dr. L. P. Barker, in a short speech, presented an<br />\noil portrait of Dr. Franklin P. Mall,<br />\nprofessor of anatomy, whose work<br />\nin embryology \"has brought distinction to the University.\"<br />\nDr. Goodnow's address was a<br />\nbrief review of the things which<br />\nhad made Hopkins great in the<br />\npast, in the course of which he<br />\ncalled the roll of some of the scholars whose work has made their<br />\nnames famous, and a very grief expression of hope for the growth of<br />\nthe University in the future. He<br />\nwas interrupted during his speech<br />\nwhen he referred to the work of<br />\nDr. Remsen, his predecessor. Dr.<br />\nRemsen was on the stage, and the<br />\naudience applauded so loudly and so<br />\nlong that the former president was<br />\ncompelled to arise and bow his acknowledgments.<br />\n\"The Hopkins has never been in<br />\na more prosperous condition financially than it is today,\" said Dr.<br />\nGoodnow. \"it now has, including<br />\nthe hoSpital, property valued at<br />\n$10,000,000 and it has received during the last four years $4,000,000.<br />\nBut (with a smile) I am sorry to<br />\nsay that that does not mean that<br />\nwe no not need money.

The<br />\nindications are that most of these<br />\ninstitutions will be well represented,<br />\nand that the Conference will be a<br />\nsuccess. Hence, it is all the more<br />\nimportant that Hopkins should be<br />\ncreditably represented.<br />\nAnother question, which should<br />\nbe of great importance to our student body, lies in the fact that the<br />\ndelegates from out of town must<br />\nbe entertained.

No autocrat and<br />\nno self-seeker can long maintain<br />\nhimself in it. A great office makes<br />\na great man seem greater -still by<br />\nreason of the opportunity it affords<br />\nhim for the use of his powers; a<br />\ngreat office makes a small man seem<br />\nsmaller still by reason of the fierce<br />\nlight which it causes to fall upon<br />\nhis littleness.<br />\n\"The man of letters, the experimental scientist, the accomplished<br />\nstudent of history or of economics,<br />\nis, by reason of his university position, under obligation to represent<br />\none aspect of university activity and<br />\nuniversity interest to the public at<br />\nlarge.

In any<br />\nlarge and complex university organization the wise president will<br />\nlive almost entirely in the future.<br />\nThe detailed matters of today will<br />\nbe dealt with by others.

All this was<br />\nclearly understood by President Gilman at the very beginning of this<br />\nUniversity when he wrote concerning the office of the president:<br />\n\"'Nothing would be more unfortunate than for the office of university president to cease to be an educational post and to become merely<br />\na business occupation.'<br />\n\"The notion that appears to be<br />\nheld by some that there is a divergence of interest between those teachers who teach and those teachers<br />\nwho are chosen to have particular<br />\n<br />\nresponsibility for the care and support of teaching is wholly illusory.<br />\nIt is the true function of educational<br />\nadministration to reduce machinery<br />\nto a minimum, to keep it out of<br />\nsight and as much as possible out of<br />\nmind, and as completely as means<br />\nwill permit to set free the two great<br />\nand largely interdependent functions of teaching and research.<br />\n\"At no time has the academic<br />\ncareer been so important as it is<br />\ntoday, at no time has it ever been<br />\nso well compensated, and at no time<br />\nhave those who pursue it been offered larger opportunities for the<br />\nexercise of influence on public<br />\nopinion.<br />\n\"The notion that nothing much<br />\nthat is permanent and worth while<br />\nhas been either known or accomplished until one's own brave self<br />\ncame upon the scene makes education difficult and, from some viewpoints, impossible. Those who remember the striking lectures of<br />\nHeinrich von Treitschke, recently<br />\ndiscovered by England and America, and now much discussed in<br />\nboth countries, will recall the fact<br />\nthat he gave but scant attention to<br />\nthe teaching of the history of Europe and of Germany, although his<br />\nchair was supposed to deal with<br />\nthose subjects.<br />\n\"What von Treitschke really did<br />\nwas to make lectures on the history<br />\nof Europe and of Germany the<br />\nvehicle for the very effective and<br />\nemphatic of his own personal opin.,<br />\nions on men and things in the world<br />\nabout him. In some degree, therefore, von Treitschke was the forerunner of that now very numerous<br />\nclass of American university professors who devote no small part<br />\nof their time to expressing to their<br />\nstudents their own personal views<br />\non the politics, the literature and<br />\nthe society of the day, while in form<br />\noffering instruction on anything<br />\nfrom astronomy to zoology.<br />\n\"There is some reason to doubt<br />\nwhether the undue dominance and<br />\nprominence of the didactic person<br />\nin the modern university is altogether an advantage. The happy<br />\ndays at Bologna certainly had much<br />\nto commend them. Then it was the<br />\nstudents who made the rules and<br />\ndisciplined their teachers; now it is<br />\nthe teachers who make the rules<br />\nand discipline their students.<br />\n\"The chief object of the university's teaching, of its libraries and<br />\nits laboratories, is, after all, to<br />\narouse intellectual interest, to stimulate curiosity and to send out a<br />\nyoung man on his voyage of discovery filled with ardent enthusiasm, enriched by close association<br />\nwith wise and noble-hearted men<br />\nand imbued with the high ambition<br />\nto make the most' of himself and of<br />\nhis chosen field of study. If even<br />\nthe most numerously attended university can do this for wo men each<br />\nyear, and if five of the ioo become<br />\ndistinguished and one of the five<br />\neminent, that university has been<br />\nsuccessful. It has done a noteworthy service to American life, to<br />\nscholarship and to science.\"<br />\n<br />\nYour favorite brands<br />\nof clothes are<br />\nreduced AGAIN<br />\nHart Schaffner & Marx<br />\nKuppenheimer<br />\nSociety Brand<br />\nR.

As yet no news has<br />\nbeen received from him, and until<br />\nthere is definite word to the contrary, Hopkins will continue to look<br />\nforward to the delivery of his. lectures in April.<br />\nOn May 6, 1889, Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nLawrence Turnbull, of Baltimore,<br />\nfounded a lectureship in memory of<br />\ntheir son, Percy Graeme Turnbull,<br />\nthat an annual course of lectures<br />\non poetry might be given by someone of importance from among the<br />\n\"properly qualified authors, writers<br />\nor professors of America or Europe.\" After some difficulty, Sir<br />\nWalter Raleigh, of Oxford, was<br />\nsecured to deliver the lectures this<br />\nyear. Although Sir Walter has not<br />\nannounced his subject, it is believed<br />\nhe will lecture on \"Chaucer,\" as this<br />\nhas been the topic of his lectures<br />\nat Oxford this season, where he has<br />\nbeen professor of English literature<br />\nsince 1904.<br />\n<br />\n23, 1915.<br />\n<br />\nThere is some doubt, however, as<br />\nto whether or not Sir Walter, with<br />\nsons in the army, will care to leave<br />\nEngland at this time. In fact, recent press reports tell how among<br />\nthe drilling regiments on the Oxford campus is to be seen a company of reserves, known as the<br />\n\"Last Ditchers,\" composed of professors and dons of the university,<br />\nmany of them well advanced in life.<br />\nIn this company, numbering the<br />\nPoet Laureate, Prof. Gilbert Murray, and others within its ranks, is<br />\nto be seen Sir Walter Raleigh drilling with the rest.

Hall gained<br />\nno advantage until the last curve,<br />\nwhen he slowly crept up, and in a<br />\nSpectacular finish bested his man at<br />\nthe tape by a few feet, giving Hopkins second place.<br />\nAn object of great interest to<br />\nlovers of the sport was Ted Meredith's beautiful performance in<br />\nthe half mile. The only man at<br />\n\"scratch,\" with a large field of opponents stretched ahead of him<br />\nwithin a range of thirty yards,<br />\nMeredith started off with a spurt<br />\nand was in the middle of the bunch<br />\nin half a lap.

Gallagher, of<br />\nMount St. Mary's, also made a<br />\nstrong finish, making a close second<br />\nto Meredith, and leaving Hutton to<br />\ntake third for Hopkins.

It<br />\ndepends for its usefulness and effectiveness wholly upon personality<br />\nand not at all upon authority.<br />\nJudged by the length and the security of tenure of its various incumbents at different institutions,<br />\nthe office is what would be called in<br />\nthe business world an extra-hazardous work. Disturbance relating to<br />\nit is not infrequent, and eviction<br />\nfrom it is not unknown. Nevertheless, ambition to hold it is well-nigh<br />\nuniversal among academic persons.<br />\n\"The beginnings of the modern<br />\noffice of university president are to<br />\nbe seen in the careers of Tappan,<br />\nat Michigan ; of Wayland, at<br />\nBrown, and of Anderson, at Rochester. Barnard, of Alabama and<br />\nColumbia, was probably the first to<br />\ngive to the office its significant relationship to general educational<br />\npolicy and to the philosophy of education. White, of Cornell; Gilman,<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, and Harper, of<br />\nChicago, were the first of that small<br />\nbut powerful group who have been<br />\nable to put their hands to the invigorating and inspiring task of<br />\ncreating a new institution out of an<br />\nidea. Eliot, of Harvard, is the pioneer among those whose work and<br />\npleasure it has been to put a wholly<br />\nnew and reconstructed modern<br />\nbuilding upon an old and highly<br />\nrespected foundation. It is a matter<br />\nof just pride to those who have<br />\nchosen the academic life and who<br />\nfollow it that American citizenship<br />\nand American scholarship bear upon<br />\ntheir rolls such names as these.<br />\n.\"The duties and responsibilities<br />\nof the office of university president<br />\nmay be summed up in a very few<br />\nwords. They are the jealous care<br /><br />\nThe University celebrated its<br />\nthirty-ninth birthday on Monday in<br />\nMcCoy Hall, President Nicholas<br />\nMurray Butler, of Columbia University, being \u2022 the guest of honor<br />\nand chief orator of the occasion.<br />\nIt was the first Commemoration<br />\nDay exercises over which President Frank J. Goodnow has presided, and he told of the great<br />\npleasure he was afforded in having<br />\nDr. Butler, his \"old personal friend<br />\nand associate,\" with him on the day.<br />\nDr. Goodnow and Dr. Butler<br />\nheaded the academic procession<br />\nwhich came slowly into the hall at<br />\no'clock. Following them were<br />\nthe trustees, the faculty in caps and<br />\ngowns, the alumni, headed by Dr.<br />\nThomas R. Brown; the graduate<br />\nstudents and the undergraduates.<br />\nAfter an invocation by President<br />\nWilliam W. Guth, of Goucher College, Dr. Goodnow introduced Dr.<br />\nButler, whose speech \"Concerning<br />\nSome Matters Academic\" was a<br />\ndefinition of the duties of a university president and professors and<br />\ntheir relation to the outside world<br />\nand the students.<br />\nAfter the address, Dr. L. P. Barker, in a short speech, presented an<br />\noil portrait of Dr. Franklin P. Mall,<br />\nprofessor of anatomy, whose work<br />\nin embryology \"has brought distinction to the University.\"<br />\nDr. Goodnow's address was a<br />\nbrief review of the things which<br />\nhad made Hopkins great in the<br />\npast, in the course of which he<br />\ncalled the roll of some of the scholars whose work has made their<br />\nnames famous, and a very grief expression of hope for the growth of<br />\nthe University in the future. He<br />\nwas interrupted during his speech<br />\nwhen he referred to the work of<br />\nDr. Remsen, his predecessor. Dr.<br />\nRemsen was on the stage, and the<br />\naudience applauded so loudly and so<br />\nlong that the former president was<br />\ncompelled to arise and bow his acknowledgments.<br />\n\"The Hopkins has never been in<br />\na more prosperous condition financially than it is today,\" said Dr.<br />\nGoodnow. \"it now has, including<br />\nthe hoSpital, property valued at<br />\n$10,000,000 and it has received during the last four years $4,000,000.<br />\nBut (with a smile) I am sorry to<br />\nsay that that does not mean that<br />\nwe no not need money.

At this meeting the purposes of the Conference will be set<br />\nforth briefly and a social program<br />\nwill follow, when an opportunity<br />\nwill be given for the delegates to<br />\nbecome acquainted with one another.<br />\nFormal announcements of the<br />\nConference have been sent to all<br />\nthe colleges and universities in<br />\nMaryland, together with Delaware<br />\nCollege, which was sent a special<br />\ninvitation as in previous years. The<br />\nindications are that most of these<br />\ninstitutions will be well represented,<br />\nand that the Conference will be a<br />\nsuccess. Hence, it is all the more<br />\nimportant that Hopkins should be<br />\ncreditably represented.<br />\nAnother question, which should<br />\nbe of great importance to our student body, lies in the fact that the<br />\ndelegates from out of town must<br />\nbe entertained. In previous years,<br />\nwhen the Conference has been held<br />\nhere, our students have met this<br />\nobligation in a most creditable manner; hence, it becomes, this year,<br />\nnot so much a question of duty as<br />\none of upholding a worthy reputation of the past. All men who can<br />\naccommodate one or more delegates<br />\nduring the three nights of the Conference are requested to confer with<br />\nSecretary Sutton.<br />\nOn Saturday, the second day of<br />\nthe Conference, there will be three<br />\nsessions: one at half-past nine in<br />\nthe morning, at two-thirty in the<br />\nafternoon, and in the evening at<br />\nhalf-past seven.

Miss<br />\nHaggard, whose home is in Boston,<br />\nis a graduate of Dennison University.<br />\nThe Saturday morning meeting<br />\nwill be devoted to technical conferences on mission study, missionary literature and the financial support of foreign missions. In the<br />\nafternoon the needs of the foreign<br />\nfields will be the subject under discussion. The session on Saturday<br />\nnight will consist of interesting fiveminute talks by men from the various foreign fields.

The statutes of a given university may be<br />\nmore or less specific in regard to<br />\nthe office of the president, and they<br />\nmay intrust to the incumbent of that<br />\noffice greater or less authority, but<br />\nthe fact remains that the office will<br />\nbe in chief part what the incumbent makes it, and the measure of\u2022<br />\nits authority will be the force of<br />\nhis personality. No autocrat and<br />\nno self-seeker can long maintain<br />\nhimself in it. A great office makes<br />\na great man seem greater -still by<br />\nreason of the opportunity it affords<br />\nhim for the use of his powers; a<br />\ngreat office makes a small man seem<br />\nsmaller still by reason of the fierce<br />\nlight which it causes to fall upon<br />\nhis littleness.<br />\n\"The man of letters, the experimental scientist, the accomplished<br />\nstudent of history or of economics,<br />\nis, by reason of his university position, under obligation to represent<br />\none aspect of university activity and<br />\nuniversity interest to the public at<br />\nlarge. It is the function of the university president to represent the<br />\nuniversity and that for which it<br />\nstands in their entirety. In any<br />\nlarge and complex university organization the wise president will<br />\nlive almost entirely in the future.<br />\nThe detailed matters of today will<br />\nbe dealt with by others. He, however, will constantly scan the horizon on the outlook for new problems and new opportunities for<br />\nscholarship and for service.<br />\n\"Within the university itself it is<br />\nthe proper function of the president<br />\nto be the friend and counselor both<br />\n'of scholars who teach and scholars<br />\nwho learn. He has the opportunity<br />\nand the privilege to bring to the<br />\nconsideration of their several problems and difficulties the point of<br />\nview of the whole university, and<br />\nthereby to place at the service of<br />\neach individual who seeks his aid<br />\nthe results of consideration given<br />\nelsewhere to similar problems and<br />\nof experience in dealing with them<br />\nthat others have had. It is also his<br />\nduty to interpret the plans, the policies and the needs of the university's teachers and directors of research' to such governing bodies as<br />\nmay exist, to hold and to care for<br />\nthe university's property and to allot its income in aid of various university undertakings. All this was<br />\nclearly understood by President Gilman at the very beginning of this<br />\nUniversity when he wrote concerning the office of the president:<br />\n\"'Nothing would be more unfortunate than for the office of university president to cease to be an educational post and to become merely<br />\na business occupation.'<br />\n\"The notion that appears to be<br />\nheld by some that there is a divergence of interest between those teachers who teach and those teachers<br />\nwho are chosen to have particular<br /><br />\nresponsibility for the care and support of teaching is wholly illusory.<br />\nIt is the true function of educational<br />\nadministration to reduce machinery<br />\nto a minimum, to keep it out of<br />\nsight and as much as possible out of<br />\nmind, and as completely as means<br />\nwill permit to set free the two great<br />\nand largely interdependent functions of teaching and research.<br />\n\"At no time has the academic<br />\ncareer been so important as it is<br />\ntoday, at no time has it ever been<br />\nso well compensated, and at no time<br />\nhave those who pursue it been offered larger opportunities for the<br />\nexercise of influence on public<br />\nopinion.<br />\n\"The notion that nothing much<br />\nthat is permanent and worth while<br />\nhas been either known or accomplished until one's own brave self<br />\ncame upon the scene makes education difficult and, from some viewpoints, impossible. Those who remember the striking lectures of<br />\nHeinrich von Treitschke, recently<br />\ndiscovered by England and America, and now much discussed in<br />\nboth countries, will recall the fact<br />\nthat he gave but scant attention to<br />\nthe teaching of the history of Europe and of Germany, although his<br />\nchair was supposed to deal with<br />\nthose subjects.<br />\n\"What von Treitschke really did<br />\nwas to make lectures on the history<br />\nof Europe and of Germany the<br />\nvehicle for the very effective and<br />\nemphatic of his own personal opin.,<br />\nions on men and things in the world<br />\nabout him. In some degree, therefore, von Treitschke was the forerunner of that now very numerous<br />\nclass of American university professors who devote no small part<br />\nof their time to expressing to their<br />\nstudents their own personal views<br />\non the politics, the literature and<br />\nthe society of the day, while in form<br />\noffering instruction on anything<br />\nfrom astronomy to zoology.<br />\n\"There is some reason to doubt<br />\nwhether the undue dominance and<br />\nprominence of the didactic person<br />\nin the modern university is altogether an advantage. The happy<br />\ndays at Bologna certainly had much<br />\nto commend them. Then it was the<br />\nstudents who made the rules and<br />\ndisciplined their teachers; now it is<br />\nthe teachers who make the rules<br />\nand discipline their students.<br />\n\"The chief object of the university's teaching, of its libraries and<br />\nits laboratories, is, after all, to<br />\narouse intellectual interest, to stimulate curiosity and to send out a<br />\nyoung man on his voyage of discovery filled with ardent enthusiasm, enriched by close association<br />\nwith wise and noble-hearted men<br />\nand imbued with the high ambition<br />\nto make the most' of himself and of<br />\nhis chosen field of study. If even<br />\nthe most numerously attended university can do this for wo men each<br />\nyear, and if five of the ioo become<br />\ndistinguished and one of the five<br />\neminent, that university has been<br />\nsuccessful.

As yet no news has<br />\nbeen received from him, and until<br />\nthere is definite word to the contrary, Hopkins will continue to look<br />\nforward to the delivery of his. lectures in April.<br />\nOn May 6, 1889, Mr. and Mrs.<br />\nLawrence Turnbull, of Baltimore,<br />\nfounded a lectureship in memory of<br />\ntheir son, Percy Graeme Turnbull,<br />\nthat an annual course of lectures<br />\non poetry might be given by someone of importance from among the<br />\n\"properly qualified authors, writers<br />\nor professors of America or Europe.\" After some difficulty, Sir<br />\nWalter Raleigh, of Oxford, was<br />\nsecured to deliver the lectures this<br />\nyear. Although Sir Walter has not<br />\nannounced his subject, it is believed<br />\nhe will lecture on \"Chaucer,\" as this<br />\nhas been the topic of his lectures<br />\nat Oxford this season, where he has<br />\nbeen professor of English literature<br />\nsince 1904.<br /><br />\n23, 1915.<br /><br />\nThere is some doubt, however, as<br />\nto whether or not Sir Walter, with<br />\nsons in the army, will care to leave<br />\nEngland at this time. In fact, recent press reports tell how among<br />\nthe drilling regiments on the Oxford campus is to be seen a company of reserves, known as the<br />\n\"Last Ditchers,\" composed of professors and dons of the university,<br />\nmany of them well advanced in life.<br />\nIn this company, numbering the<br />\nPoet Laureate, Prof. Gilbert Murray, and others within its ranks, is<br />\nto be seen Sir Walter Raleigh drilling with the rest. It is doubtful<br />\nwhether he will care to think of<br />\nAmerioa.<br />\nSir Walter is known as an excellent lecturer and writer.
