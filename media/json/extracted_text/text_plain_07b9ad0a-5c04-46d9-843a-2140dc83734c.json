But it<br />\nrepresents a continuation of trends unwelcome to<br />\nundergraduates seeking a broad education. Although few<br />\ndepartments arc above reproach, among the worst examples<br />\nof inadequate offerings for non-majors are in the<br />\ndepartments of Anthropology (4 courses) and Near Eastern<br />\nStudies (5 courses). These two cases are unfortunate not<br />\nonly due to the low number of offerings, but also because<br />\ngood general courses on topics such as Physical<br />\nAnthropology or the Origins of Civilization could be of<br />\nconsiderable interest to any student with even the slightest<br />\ninterest in the history of man.<br />\nThe list of Intersession courses this year is a joke. Except<br />\nfor courses in Psychology and the Writing Seminars,<br />\nopportunities are nominal or non-existent. Most faculty<br />\nand administrators don't give a damn about Intersession.<br />\nCourse selection is consistently sparse at Hopkins because<br />\nthe faculty makes it that way. While sonic professors are<br />\nquite enthusiastic about teaching, too many do only the<br />\nminimum required for them to get by in their department.<br />\nThe student apathy that some professors say make<br />\nundergraduates uninteresting<br />\nto teach is frequently a<br />\nreflection of the way the faculty members themselves<br />\napproach their courses.<br />\nHowever, the basic source of the problem is not ill will or<br />\nindolence by professors. The problem is a system which<br />\nstrongly discourages efforts towards teaching. This is<br />\nespecially true for junior faculty, who could otherwise be<br />\nthe most eager to educate undergrads. But the way things<br />\nare now, why should \u2022 they waste their time and energy?<br />\nJust like students, they can hardly afford to work on<br />\nprojects for which they get no credit. Teaching receives no<br />\ncredit in tenure decisions. Only research counts. Course<br />\ndevelopment is valuable and constructive, and must be<br />\nconsidered in the evaluation of a tenure candidate's work.<br />\nThe conservative faculty forces which oppose this proposal<br />\nimplicitly view undergraduate students as a necessary<br />\ninconvenience to be endured at this University.<br />\n<br />\nGood Art Work<br />\nThe J.H.U. Fine Arts Committee will be presenting<br />\nsaxophonist Lol Coxhill and guitarist Fred Frith in solo<br />\nconcerts at Hopkins on December 6th and 16th<br />\nrespectively. This will be Coxhill's first performance ever in<br />\nAmerica and only Frith's second, but both musicians have<br />\nstrong, established reputations in Europe despite their<br />\nAmerican obscurity. The organizers of these concerts, who<br />\nare Hopkins undergraduates, arc bringing these<br />\nacknowledged masters to America...and to Hopkins. The<br />\nCommittee is making major strides towards establishing<br />\nHopkins as a center for progressive music in America. The<br />\nopportunity to experience this new and different type of<br />\nmusic is extraordinary. Congratulations to the Fine Arts<br />\nCommittee for bringing this reknowncd talent to Hopkins.<br />\nThe event deserves support from anyone who has a mild<br />\ninterest in any style of music.<br />\n<br />\nLittle Big Loss<br />\n<br />\nThe adminstration has just. proposed to convert the Little<br />\nTheatre in Levering into office space.

As another from that<br />\nflock of beleaguered species I can<br />\nmake no corrections to what Mr.<br />\nErcolano has written, only<br />\nseveral additions:<br />\n1. Bali imoreans can't drive.<br />\n2. Commuters have to buy<br />\ngasoline. At sixty-six cents<br />\ngallon for self serve the<br />\ncommuter not only gets robbed<br />\nbut gets to smell the gas on his<br />\nhands all morning. (Yes, you<br />\nsheltered dormies, sixty-six cents<br />\nfor lead-free and I buy it in the<br />\nsuburbs. Premium gas, not self<br />\nserve, is pushing eighty cents in<br />\nthe city.)<br />\n3. Baltimoreans can't drive in<br />\nthe rain.<br />\n4. Mr. Ercolano neglected to<br />\nmention the fun of sliding into<br />\nschool on a snowy morning. This<br />\npast winter was the worst since<br />\nthere was more snow than ever<br />\nand the plows were out either<br />\ntoo early or too late.<br />\n5. Baltimoreans can't drive in<br />\nthe snow.<br />\n6. If a domiie forgets an<br />\nassignment at his place of<br />\nresidence he can run back and<br />\nhell be just two minutes late for<br />\nclass. If a commuter forgets an<br />\nassignment, he can take the lower<br />\ngrade or he can take a trip home<br />\n(half an hour in each chi ection in<br />\nmy case) and get it.<br />\n7. Baltimorearip can't drive on<br />\na perfectly clear day with the sun<br />\nshining.<br />\n8. And if a dormie needs to do<br />\nresearch or get some quiet<br />\nstudying done, D Level and the<br />\nHut are just a short stroll away.<br />\nThe commuter has to face an<br />\nexhausting trip in Baltimore<br />\ntraffic or wait until the family<br />\ngets to sleep at midnight before<br />\neverything is quiet.<br />\n9. Those Baltimoreans who<br />\ncan drive are in constant<br />\ntiepidation of city, county and<br />\nstate cops who want to restrict<br />\nthem whenever possible.<br />\n10.

The Gam<br />\nbrothers had taken preventive<br />\nmeasures to put an end to this<br />\nimpish joke by securely bolting<br />\nthe frames to the wall with<br />\nseveral four inch lag bolts. This in<br />\nour opinion would have<br />\ndiscouraged any normal person;<br />\nhowever these two women<br />\nexhibited the determination<br />\ninbread in every Goucher honey.<br />\nIn order to accomplish their task,<br />\nthey proceeded to rip the frames<br />\noff the wall causing the frames to<br />\nsplinter and the glass to break,<br />\nutterly destroying the<br />\ncomposites. One composite was<br />\nliterally ripped out of its frame.<br />\nThese composites cost the<br />\nfraternity approximately<br />\n$300.00 each. Our concern is not<br />\nso much with pecuniary value of<br />\nthe item but with its intrinsic<br />\nvalue.<br />\nOver the weekend, the Gam<br />\nbrothers shrewdly pieced<br />\ntogether a few bizarre clues and<br />\nwere able to pinpoint the<br />\nloca-tion of the composites. On<br />\nSunday morning, in true Kojak<br />\nform, several Gam Brothers<br />\nsurprised Cindy and Amy in their<br />\ndorm room, whereupon the two<br />\nmutilated composites were<br />\nrecovered.<br />\nSeveral of the brothers<br />\nadvocated a severe reprisal in<br />\norder to put an end to this<br />\nblasphemy. Some foolhardily<br />\nsuggested tar and feathers, others<br />\nagreed to screw them over slowly<br />\n, and painfully (?), however we<br />\nhave decided not to retaliate to<br />\nthis act of vandalism by<br />\ncommitting an equally insane act.<br />\nInstead we have decided to help<br />\nthese two poor young ladies. We<br />\nare presently collecting funds in<br />\norder that Cindy and Amy may<br />\nreceive a few sessions of<br />\npsychotherapy at the Hopkins<br />\nCounseling and Psychiatric ,<br />\nCenter here on campus.<br />\nGAM Fraternity<br />\n<br />\nMiss-Spell<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWhy 110 more cheesecake<br />\npictures?

During<br />\nthe ensuing years, however,<br />\nadherence to the spirit and the<br />\nletter of the Ethics Code has<br />\nbeen minimal,Though the causes<br />\nmay be manyfold, the lax<br />\nimplementation of the Ethics<br />\nCode is probably due in large<br />\npart to the fact that a pleat<br />\nportion of the students 'and<br />\nfaculty are unaware of the<br />\nprovisions of the Code and the<br />\nworkings of the Ethics Beard. It<br />\nis the intention of this letter to<br />\nserve as an introduction to the<br />\nBoard's procedures and policies.<br />\nIn the Hopkins community,<br />\nboth the students and the faculty<br />\nare responsible for minimizing<br />\nviolations of academic integrity,<br />\ni.e. cheating, plagiarism,<br />\nfalsification, etc., and for<br />\nreporting them to the Ethics<br />\nBoard. The course instructors<br />\nmay handle violations on their<br />\nown or request that the Ethics<br />\nBoard appoint a hearing panel to<br />\ndetermine the student's guilt or<br />\ninnocence, and if necessary, an<br />\nappropriate penalty. In turn, the<br />\nstudent accused of a violation<br />\nmay either accept the decision<br />\nsuggested by the instructor, or he<br />\nmay be the one to request a<br />\nhearing panel if he is unsure of<br />\nreceiving an impartial decision<br />\nfrom his instructor. Penalties<br />\nassessed by the Board are not<br />\nnecessarily more severe than<br />\nthose meted out by individual<br />\ncrofessors. It should be<br />\nemphasized that one of the<br />\nimportant functions of the Ethics<br />\nBoard is to protect the students'<br />\nright to fair treatment.<br />\nThe Board's work, however, is<br />\nnot limited to holding hearings.<br />\nCont. on p. 5<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br />\n<br />\nOpinion<br />\n<br />\nWalters Questions Carter's Anti-Inflation Guidelines<br />\nDr. Alan A. Walters, a<br />\nprofessor ofPolitical Economy at<br />\nthe Johns Hopkins University,<br />\nhas served as an economic advisor<br />\nto Singapore and to former<br />\nBritish Prime Minister Harold<br />\nWilson. He currently works for<br />\nthe World Bank.<br />\n\u2022 Inflation is a persistent rise<br />\nin the general level of prices--now<br />\nmounting to about 8 percent a<br />\nyear in the United States. And<br />\ninflation is caused by \"too much<br />\nmoney chasing too few goods\"<br />\n(this old chestnut is perfectly<br />\nsound). Inflation will be greater<br />\nthe larger the increases on the<br />\nquantity of money and the<br />\nsmaller the increase in the<br />\nquantity of goods.<br />\nGovernment has had a hand in<br />\nboth increasing the amount of<br />\nmoney and restricting the<br />\nquantity of goods. During 1977-8<br />\nthe government paid for growing<br />\ngovernment spending, not<br />\nprimarily with taxes or<br />\ngovernment borrowing from the<br />\npublic, but by printing dollar<br />\nnotes and issuing its own<br />\npromises-to-pay.<br />\nAlthough the government<br />\n(President,Congress and the<br />\nFederal Reserve Board), has<br />\ncaused the great inflation of<br />\n1977-8, they are quick in<br />\ndenying any substantial<br />\nresponsibility. (The President<br />\n<br />\nhimself has said that he is against<br />\ninflation, so how can he be<br />\nblamed?) The real culprits, it is<br />\nsaid, are the greedy trade unions,<br />\nrapacious businessmen, grasping<br />\nforeigners, such as oily sheiks,<br />\nand the Almighty (through<br />\nplagues, fib )ls, etc.). Apart from<br />\nprayer, which fortunately has a<br />\nlow marginal cost, although<br />\ndoubtful marginal product, one<br />\ncan do little about natural<br />\ncalamities. And one can do little<br />\nabout foreigners. (However I<br />\ndon't see why the United States<br />\nshould enter into commodity<br />\nagreements and import<br />\nrestrictions--on textiles for<br />\nexample --which drive up the<br />\nprices on domestic market and<br />\nimpoverish poor people in the<br />\nUnited States and East Asia). But<br />\nGeorge Meany and Henry Ford<br />\n(III) are Americans and so can be<br />\n'guided' or controlled by the<br />\nPresident and his staff of<br />\ndoughty inflation fighters. At<br />\npresent only 'guidelines' are<br />\ndeployed; any perspicacious<br />\nobserver will anticipate that if<br />\nthe voluntary guidelines are seen<br />\nto be ineffective, regulation of<br />\nprices and wages will soon<br />\nfollow.<br />\nIt is \"Catch-22.\" Since<br />\neveryone will anticipate<br />\nmandatory controls all<br />\nbusinessmen and union leaders<br />\nwill be increasing their prices and<br />\n<br />\nwages much more rapidly than<br />\nthey normally would, in<br />\nanticipation of the wage and<br />\nprice 'freeze' (a la Nixon 1971)<br />\nto come during this winter. \"Get<br />\n'em up now\" is heard, loud in the<br />\nland. And as we see the present<br />\nescalation of prices and wages, in<br />\nanticipation of the freeze, it will<br />\nbe widely argued that voluntary<br />\ncontrols have failed. The big stick<br />\nmust be wielded to contain price<br />\nand wage demands. And of<br />\ncourse there will then be a magic<br />\neffect of mandatory methods;<br />\nprices and wages, having<br />\nincreased at a tremendous lick<br />\nduring the anticipatory periods<br />\nwill then pause. The regulators<br />\nwill congratulate themselves on<br />\nbeing 'realistic' but 'tough,' fair'<br />\nbut 'flexible,' and so on.<br />\nSuch guidelines and controls,<br />\nif effective, make the inflation<br />\nworse. They reduce the quantity<br />\nof goods available for sale,<br />\ncreating shortages and black<br />\nmarkets. This shortage has<br />\noacurred already with natural<br />\ngas--the price of which has been<br />\nregulated for many years.<br />\nAmerican firms find it<br />\nunprofitable to produce natural<br />\ngas and switch their energies to<br />\nother pursuits; meanwhile the<br />\nlimited quantity of gas still<br />\nflowing has to be rationed and<br />\naugmented by imports of energy<br />\nfrom Arab kingdoms. In view of<br />\n<br />\nthe impending deregulation of<br />\nnatural gas one would have<br />\nthought that the President had<br />\nlearned one important lesson--but<br />\nI would not bet on that.<br />\nPosturing and pusillanimity<br />\nrather than reason and reflection<br />\nseem to be the hallmarks of the<br />\npresent administration.<br />\nAttempting to reduce inflation<br />\nby price and wage controls is like<br />\ntrying to stop a house<br />\noverheating by breaking all the<br />\nthermostats instead of reducing<br />\nthe fire in the furnace. The<br />\noverheating of the economy is<br />\ndue to the too rapid expansion of<br />\nthe money supply--brought about<br />\nlargely by too rapid an increase<br />\nin spending by the Federal<br />\ngovernment. There are some<br />\nhopeful signs that, at long last,<br />\nthe money supply is being<br />\n<br />\nbrought under suitably tight<br />\ncontrol and the Federal deficit is,<br />\nat least, being reviewed with<br />\nsuitable alarm. However, the<br />\nnaive view that virtually all<br />\nimportant problems could be<br />\nsolved by throwing sufficient<br />\nFederal money at them is bruised<br />\nand battered but not dead. It<br />\ngenerated the great American<br />\ninflation which began in 1963<br />\nand, I suspect, has many more<br />\nyears to run. My main fear is that<br />\nthe despairing attempts to deal<br />\nwith the symptoms of inflation,<br />\nby mandatory controls, will<br />\ndestroy some of the most<br />\nimportant freedoms, already<br />\nsadly eroded, which were<br />\nfashioned two centuries ago by<br />\nthose prodigious Founding<br />\nFathers.<br />\n<br />\n.4=114.1=WOMIN<br />\n<br />\nWelcome Back!<br />\nWhile you were away this summer<br />\nA Great New Disco has opened in Towson<br />\n<br />\nDISCOTHEQUE & BACKGAMMON CLUB<br />\nLoch Raven Plaza<br />\n<br />\nekfteatistatalleeMOMONOWINWOMOMONANIMOIMMONOMMOM<br />\n<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS NIGHT<br />\nEvERy WEdNEsday NighT<br />\n\u2014 vrommoomorammoreameasonommommoommwo<br />\nBring this ad or present your College ID<br />\nfor reduced admission charge of only $1.00<br />\nDress\u2014 Like A Star\"<br />\nSTRICTLY F NFORCED\u2014No Jeans, Tennis Shoes, Sandals<br />\nTube Tops.

Dr. Hall has also<br />\nattempted to relate the<br />\nadvancement of women's status<br />\nin society to a possible decline in<br />\nnon-verbal<br />\nabilities, but<br />\ninsufficient information is<br />\navailable concerning women in<br />\nother societies.<br />\nThe negative stereotypes of<br />\nwomen as manipulators or<br />\npsychics may possibly derive<br />\nfrom greater female sensitivity<br />\nand non-verbal abilities, Dr. Hall<br />\nsaid.

One<br />\nstudent among those working to<br />\nrestore day shifts stated that the<br />\nUnion meeting scheduled for<br />\nearly next week is a definite<br />\nfactor in the postponement. The<br />\nannouncement has already been<br />\npostponed twice since its original<br />\n<br />\nN FIEDS<br />\nCLASSI<br />\n<br />\nas \"off-the record\".<br />\nConsequently, anyone who<br />\nopenly exploits such forbidden<br />\nknowledge may<br />\nbe viewed as<br />\ndishonest.<br />\nBecause the study measured<br />\nthe ability to receive and convey<br />\nnon-verbal signals associated with<br />\nWestern cultures, those people<br />\nwho come from other societies<br />\nand whose language was not<br />\nrelated to English performed<br />\nworse than other subjects.<br />\nSensitivity also varied according<br />\nto occupation, with actors<br />\ncoming out on top and<br />\nexecutives near the bottom.<br />\nDr. Hall stressed that the result<br />\nof any non-verbal<br />\ncommunication studies cannot be<br />\na dictionary of signals, for they<br />\nvary according to culture,<br />\nsituational context, and personal<br />\nidiosyncrasies. Many non-verbal<br />\ncommunication self-help books<br />\nmade this mistake she said.<br />\nSuch works also suffer from a<br />\nkey contradiction, according to<br />\nDr. Hall. They say that since non<br />\nverbal signals are involuntary,<br />\none can manipulate them to his<br />\nown advantage.

Smith,<br />\nProfessor of Microbiology at the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, and Dr. Daniel Nathans, Director of the<br />\nDepartment of Microbiology at Johns Hopkins, were<br />\nnamed winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine. They<br />\nshared this honor with Dr. Werner Arber of Switzerland.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins microbiologists received their<br />\nawards for research investigating the nature of sitespecific restriction enzymes. Their discoveries have<br />\nprovided scientists with the means for unlocking the<br />\nsecrets of DNA.<br />\nBacteria produce restriction enzymes to provide<br />\nprotection against viruses. When viruses invade bacterial<br />\ncell walls, the restriction enzymes cut the viral DNA into<br />\nnumerous fragments. To protect themselves from having<br />\ntheir. own DNA destroyed, bacteria utilize specific<br />\nmethylated enzymes to provide a protective coating.<br />\nDr. Smith discovered the first site-specific restriction<br />\nenzyme and its corresponding methylase. His<br />\nexperimental findings provided verification of Werner<br />\nArber's theories concerning the existence of restriction<br />\nenzymes.<br />\nRestriction enzymes allow DNA to be cut into<br />\nfragments in specific sites. Through this technique the<br />\norder of genes on the chromosome and their chemical<br />\nstructure may be determined. New combinations of genes<br />\nmay be created in the laboratory. The increased<br />\nknowledge obtained by the use of these \"chemical<br />\nknives\" provides molecular biologists and geneticists with<br />\nthe mechanism which may solve many problems in<br />\nbiology and medicine.<br />\nQ: Would you summarize the significance of the<br />\n<br />\nresearch for which .you received the Nobel Prize?<br />\nA: My accomplishment is rather simple. Namely in the<br />\nperiod of 1968 to 1970 when 1 was a new faculty member<br />\nhere at Johns Hopkins Medical School. a postdoctoral<br />\nstudent and I discovered a cleavage site specific restriction<br />\nenzyme. It was the first one that had ever been found.<br />\nI think that it was important in the way that we<br />\npresented the work. We displayed a very complete picture<br />\nin two articles appeasing in the Journal of Molecular<br />\nBiology in 1970. One was a detailed description of the<br />\nenzyme in which we proved its specificity by actually<br />\ndetermining the sequence of nucleotides in DNA that was<br />\nrecognized by the enzyme. The other showed where the<br />\ncleavage sites were located.<br />\nInstead of just publishing many short papers we<br />\npresented the entire thing at One time; and this made it<br />\nclear to everyone. particularly biochemists and biologists.<br />\nthat here was an enzyme that cleaved exactly in a<br />\nparticular sequence of DNA. It was now obvious that you<br />\ncould cut DNA into specific fragments.<br />\nQ: it<br />\nwas the relationship between your reseanli<br />\n<br />\nand that performed by Drs. Werner Arber and Daniel<br />\nNat/tans?<br />\nA: Prior to my investigations, Werner Arber, a<br />\ngeneticist, had written a paper describing another type of<br />\nrestriction enzyme that was not cleavage site-specific. He<br />\nlaid the foundations for the existence of these enzymes.<br />\nDr. Arber studied phage restriction and modification in<br />\nbacteria, and he induced from his observations that there<br />\nmust exist a site-specific enzyme. He presumed it would<br />\nbe an endonuclease. Dr. Arber also believed that there<br />\nwould be a site-specific modification enzyme that would<br />\nprotect against the restriction enzyme cleavage. In a<br />\nreview in 1965, he clearly stated that there were probably<br />\nsite-specific endonuclease modification enzymes.<br />\nIn the closing paragraphs of that review he speculated<br />\non future developments, and he stated that he thought<br />\nthat these enzymes would become useful tools in DNA<br />\nsequence work. He, therefore, really saw what was to<br />\ncome.<br />\nWe were fortunate to have Dr. Daniel Nathans here at<br />\nHopkins at the time of out discovery of a cleavage<br />\nsite-specific restriction enzyme. Dr. Nathans had a<br />\nparticular problem that could not be worked out by<br />\nstandard genetics and was looking for another approach.<br />\nHe employed restriction enzyme to cut DNA from<br />\nsimian virus 40 into numerous fragments and was able to<br />\nidentify the pattern of genes of this virus responsible for<br />\ninitiating tumor-producing protein.<br />\nQ: Since your initial discovery of site-specific<br />\nrestriction enzymes, what investigations have you been<br />\npursuing?<br />\nA: Immediately after we finished the restriction<br />\n<br />\nenzyme work, I suggested to one of the graduate student<br />\nthat he look at DNA methylases because many workers in<br />\nthe field at the time were saying that we really do not<br />\nknow if some of these site-specific enzymes are truly<br />\nrestriction enzymes. Such enzymes must have a<br />\nmodification enzyme of the same specificity in order to<br />\nqualify as a restriction enzyme, because<br />\nrestriction-modification systems are made up of two<br />\nenzymes acting at the same time. We experimented with DNA methylase and eventually<br />\nfound four different adenine methylases in the strain of<br />\nbacteria that we were working with. One of these<br />\nprotected against cleavage by our restriction enzyme, and<br />\nproved to be the modification enzyme which satisfied the<br />\nnecessary biological requirements.<br />\nSubsequently, we found another methylase which<br />\nprotected DNA against cleavage. This led to the discovery<br />\nof a second enzyme which we had not previously<br />\nrecognized.<br />\nQ: Have you continued to work with these restriction<br />\nenzymes in recent years.'<br />\n<br />\nNot only is it the basic building block of<br />\nA: We are still working with restriction s enzymes. I<br />\nwould classify most of our subsequent work as being kind<br />\nof \"routine.\" It has potential which has not been fully<br />\nrealized. We are concentrating on using the restriction and<br />\nmodification enzymes as model systems for studying<br />\nsequence recognition by proteins.<br />\nThere are a great variety of enzymes which recognize<br />\nspecific nucleotide sequences. What we want to do is<br />\ndetermine the mechanism by which a given enzyme will<br />\nfit a particular nucleotide site and recognize it very<br />\naccurately.<br />\nOur approach to this problem has been through the use<br />\nof base analogs by chemically modifying various groups<br />\non the nucleotides, and seeing what effect that might have<br />\non the enzyme activity. Then one may ask the question:<br />\nIs a particular group --let's say on the guanine<br />\nring--involved in recognition or not? You can remove the<br />\ngroup or you can insert a modifying group to determine<br />\nwhat effect it has on activity or on binding. We have<br />\nlooked mainly at activity.<br />\nQ: Were you aware of the fact that you were being<br />\nconsidered for the Nobel Prize?<br />\nA: I did not have any prior knowledge. I really did not<br />\nknow that I was even being considered. It has been eight<br />\nyears since the original work was published. I cannot<br />\nthink of any single year where it ever occurred to me that<br />\nI should take special note of the news during the month<br />\nof October!<br />\nI knew that the work had had a big impaCt in the field,<br />\nbut I never sat back and said,\"Gee, they ought to give me<br />\na Nobel Prize for it.\" However, some people had told me<br />\nthat I might get one some day. Some investigators do<br />\nextremely elegant and brilliant pieces of work requiring a<br />\ngreat deal of intellectual effort. This work we did for the<br />\nfun of it, and it sort of fell together. At the same time we<br />\ndid not realize that it was going to be that important. It<br />\nwas a nice piece of work, but we did not have a clear<br />\nnotion that a large part of future research in this field<br />\nwould depend on our findings.<br />\nQ: How were you notified that you had won the prize?.<br />\nA: I can remember it vividly! It was about 8:50 A.M. in<br />\nthe morning and I was having a cup of coffee with mY<br />\nwife. The children had already gone to school, and I was<br />\njust gathering up my papers. I was almost ready to go out<br />\nthe door when the telephone rang. My wife picked it up<br />\nand said, \"Hold it a minute. It is the Associated Press.''<br />\nShe thought that the call was about the recombinant<br />\nDNA hearings in Washington, and that the reporters<br />\nwanted to get my viewpoint. I said,\"Okay, give it to me.'<br />\nThe Associated Press said that they had just received<br />\nword on the wire service that I had been awarded the<br />\nNobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. The co-winners<br />\n<br />\n\f1E NOT IVY LEAGUE!!!<br />\nDr. Hamilton 0.Smith by Roger Blumenthal<br />\n<br />\n'ng block oflift -- but it 's 90 proof to boot!<br />\n<br />\nwere Drs. Daniel Nathans and Werner Arber..<br />\nI was actually speechless. After recovering control of<br />\nmy thoughts, I turned to my wife and reported what the<br />\nA.P. representative had just told me. The reporter tried to<br />\ninterview me at this point, but I could not give very<br />\ncoherent answers to his questions. After about fifteen<br />\nminutes, he said, \"Thank you, Dr. Smith.\" The telephone<br />\nrang immediately again, and it was another news service.<br />\nBy that time, I was a little more composed and was<br />\nable to provide more background information. I was not<br />\neven positive for what work I had been awarded the prize.<br />\nThere were several more calls after that, and<br />\nsubsequently, I left my wife toanswer the telephone.<br />\nWhen I arrived at the medical school, the place was<br />\ngoing berserk! There were crowds of people standing in<br />\nthe halls. When I got to my office, there was a big sign<br />\nsaying Congratulations. Everyone in East Baltimore<br />\napparently got the word before I did. I just thank God<br />\nthat I did not hear it on the car radio or I probably would<br />\nhave been wrapped around a telephone pole somewhere.<br />\nQ: Are you making preparations to deliver your<br />\nacceptance speech?<br />\nA: Yes, I certainly am. It is traditional to review and<br />\ngive a personal account of the research that resulted in the<br />\nprize. I am certainly going to do that in the opening<br />\nparagraphs.<br />\nMy main emphasis, however, is going to be on our<br />\ninterests in gene sequence recognition and the use of these<br />\nenzymes as model systems.<br />\nApparently there is no restriction in what one talks<br />\nabout in these lectures. I have noticed that some of the<br />\npast laureates who spoke (fifteen or twenty years after<br />\ncompleting their work) selected a subject which was not<br />\nreally closely related to the investigation that resulted in<br />\nthe prize. For example, Watson and Crick did not get up<br />\nand describe the structure of DNA, since it was \"old<br />\nstuff\" by the time that they received their awards. One<br />\nspoke about protein synthesis and the other talked about<br />\nthe genetic code.<br />\nQ: Are you satisfied with the National Institute of<br />\nHealth guidelines concerning recombinant DNA?<br />\nA: No, I am not. I think that they are much too<br />\nstringent. My feeling is that a majority of the scientists<br />\nnow are thinliing that the guidelines need to be relaxed.<br />\nThat is the direction in which things are going. The<br />\n, revised guidelines which have been under consideration in<br />\nthe past year will be considerably less restrictive.<br />\nQ: Some of the fears that concern opponents of DNA<br />\nresearch are that recombinant strains of bacteria would be<br />\nresistant to antibiotics, completely new types of bacteria<br />\nwould be produced, and increases in various forms of<br />\n<br />\ncancer would occur. Some feel that these effects would<br />\nnot show up for many years. What is your view about the<br />\npossibility ofsuch catastrophes taking place?<br />\nA: I can only give you my opinion. That is one of the<br />\nproblems in the entire controversy. One can only give<br />\nopinions. There is no basis for any firm statements.<br />\nOne person says that he thinks it is dangerous; the<br />\nother investigator says that he thinks it is safe, and no one<br />\ncan refute either opinion. I do not think that any of these<br />\nhorrible things will occur.<br />\nNature has alrea'dy carried out as many recombinations<br />\nas it can; it has already tried to fill all the niches, and I do<br />\nnot think that we are going to discover any new ones.<br />\nThis is just an intuitive feeling. It is just an opinion, and I<br />\nam certain that another person with a different viewpoint<br />\nmight say that if someone went oeit of his way to take a<br />\ntoxic gene and splice it into an innocuous bacterium that<br />\ninhabits man without producing disease, (let's say that<br />\nyou took the diptheria toxin gene and stuck it into E.<br />\nColi) maybe he could produce something that would be<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nmaintain no responsible investigator would be foolish<br />\nenough to do this.<br />\nQ: Do you foresee much use of genetic engineering in<br />\nthe coming years on human beings?<br />\nA: The injection of recombinant DNA into man to give<br />\nnew characteristics interests some. It may be employed to<br />\ncorrect existing defects, but I think that it is real science<br />\nfiction at this point to think that you could turn some<br />\naverage guy into a Beethoven by placing the right set of<br />\ngenes into him. We really do not know very much about<br />\nwhat makes one person superior to another one.<br />\n<br />\nDetroit. During this period I became very interested in the<br />\nrapidly developing field of genetics. It was my good<br />\nfortune to obtain a research appointme:it in the<br />\nDepartment of Human Genetics at the University of<br />\nMichigan.<br />\nQ: When did you return to Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool?<br />\nA: After five years at the University of Michigan, I<br />\ncame to Hopkins as an assistant professor in 1967. I was<br />\npromoted to full professor of Microbiology in 1973.<br />\nQ: In the book Who Should Play God?lby Ted Howard<br />\nand Jeremy Rifkin, it is stated that restriction enzymes<br />\nare commercially available and may be obtained by<br />\nanyone who wishes to purchase them. The authors<br />\ndescribe sensational advertising which could encourage<br />\nany high school student to set up a recombinant DNA lab<br />\nin his own home. Do you believe that the average high<br />\nschool student could become involved in manipulations<br />\nwith recombinant DNA?<br />\nA: Yes, any high school student could do this. You can<br />\nbuy restriction enzymes and you can even buy DNA. It is<br />\neasy to mix the two in a test tube along with the proper<br />\nbuffer. It is relatively easy to work with these substances<br />\nand produce recombinant DNA. Then this can be<br />\nintroduced into E. coli organisms and become<br />\nincorporated into bacteria.<br />\nQ What is your opinion about the recent book which<br />\ndescribes the cloning ofa human being?<br />\nA: That is pure hogwash! Only in lower animals has<br />\nthis process been successful.<br />\nQ: What do you anticipate will be the directions which,<br />\nresearch in DNA molecular biology will take in the next<br />\n<br />\nQ: Does adequate technology exist for changing the<br />\ngenes of man?<br />\nA: I do not think it is practical now. It might be<br />\npossible to replace a gene defect in a limited sort of way,<br />\nbut to change one gene for another does not seem to me<br />\nto be at all feasible.<br />\nQ: Where did you receive your undergraduate<br />\neducation and medical training?<br />\nA: I attended the University of Illinois for two years<br />\nwith the intention of majoring in mathematics. In my<br />\njunior year I transferred to the University of California at<br />\nBerkeley. By this time I had decided that biological<br />\nresearch with a particular emphasis on neurophysiology<br />\nwas the field tilat interested me most.<br />\nIn 1952 I was admitted into the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool. I must admit that during my medical school days,<br />\nI probably spent more time reading scientific journals<br />\nthan the basic textbooks.<br />\nAfter finishing medical school I interned at Barnes<br />\nHopsital in St. Louis. Following service in the navy I was<br />\nappointed resident in medicine at the Ford Hospital in<br />\n<br />\nfew years?<br />\nA: I believe there will be extensive commercial<br />\napplications to produce protein products which are of<br />\ntherapeutic value in humans. I see continued study of<br />\nDNA sequences and basic research progress in this field.<br />\nThere undoubtedly will be advances in determining the<br />\nstructure of genes. I expect that some type of gene<br />\ntherapy will eventually be successful, although I am not<br />\ncertain what particular genetic defects might be<br />\nsusceptible to treatment.<br />\nIn regards to cancer, cloned DNA should be of value in<br />\nbasic research. I do not foresee the use of modified DNA<br />\nas a tool for the direct treatment of cancer unless some<br />\nnew concept makes this approach possible.<br />\nQ: I understand that you have a reasonably large<br />\nfamily. Are any of your children demonstrating an<br />\ninterest in scientific reserach?<br />\nA: My wife and I have four boys and one girl. At the<br />\npresent time there does not appear to be an academic<br />\ntalent in the whole group. I suspect that they will have to<br />\nfind their niche in the business world!<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 10 / DECEMBER I, 1978<br />\nA<br />\n<br />\nO&M<br />\n<br />\nAMik<br />\n<br />\nAM<br />\n<br />\nA measure uome vt tasy & miling POOdS<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u20224 WiTh<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nDISCO:<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 STARLINE<br />\n<br />\nTHE HOMEWOOD<br />\nDELICATESSEN<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nJOHN TAYLOR<br />\n<br />\nJUST ABOVE 31st STREET<br />\n3105 ST.

Screenings<br />\nwill be in Shriver Hall, beginning at 7:30 p.m.<br />\nA remarkable, and still active, director, whose career<br />\nspans more than fifty years, Bunuel has always been a<br />\nrevolutionary filmmaker, assaulting bourgeois and<br />\nstorytelling conventions. Working with Salvador Dali, and<br />\nother surrealists, he made two symbol-laden films in the<br />\nlate 1920's, Un Chien Andalou and L'Age D'Or, which<br />\nexperimented with fragmented story lines. These are<br />\noutright attacks on the Catholic Church, bourgeois<br />\nsociety--on all civilized values and institutions.<br />\nThen, after directing a documentary about Spanish<br />\npoverty, Land Without Bread, he stopped making films<br />\nand spent most of the 1930's and 1940's working at<br />\nvarious studio jobs, including the preparation and<br />\nsub titling of Hollywood films for Spanish-speaking<br />\naudiences.<br />\nIt wasn't until the 1950's that Bunuel resurfaced in<br />\nMexico. His Les Olivados, a bitter depiction of how our<br />\nsociety causes juvenile delinquency, once again brought<br />\nhim worldwide attention. Since then, in what has come to<br />\nbe called his Golden Age, Bunuel has continued making<br />\nfilms in France and Spain, and with righteous consistency,<br />\nan inexorable logic of the illogical, he still wages his<br />\nsurrealist war on the world of bourgeois reason and<br />\nliberalism.<br />\nFreeely adapted from a Joseph Kessel novel, Belle du<br />\nJour (1967)is about an unhappily married woman, played<br />\nby Catherine Deneuve, whose handsome, successful and<br />\nproper surgeon husband bores her and perhaps is the<br />\ncause of her frigidity.<br />\nThinking about prostitution leads her to sign on at a<br />\nbrothel, where she only works from 2-5 (hence her<br />\nnickname and the film's title). As Bunuel makes evident,<br />\nher daytime occupation really has nothing to do with any<br />\nneed for money, but has everything to do with sexual<br />\nperversity and revenge, with how people, bored by moral<br />\nrestraints, will uphold the social facade while indulging in<br />\nbehind-the-scenes degradation. After all, a boutique is the<br />\nfront for the brothel, and the employees work in both<br />\nshopnd whorehouse.<br />\nShot in color, Belle du Jour ,and its star have a cold,<br />\ndetached beauty, which Bunuel emphasizes by stripping<br />\nthe soundtrack of any music, removing nearly all<br />\nreferences to a particular society or era, and by framing<br />\nshots not just of Deneuve's face, but of different body<br />\nparts as well, showing how she is a body in the<br />\nmarketplace of marriage An ambiguous ending invites<br />\nthe audience to speculate and moralize, while freeing the<br />\ndirector from doing the latter; indeed, the entire film is<br />\nan ambiguous series of dreams about her inner erotic life.<br />\nKessel's reality is here transferred into a dreamland, where<br />\nwhat really happens and what is merely imagined become<br />\nindistinguishable.<br />\nCatherine Deneuve also stars in Tristana (1970), the<br />\nfirst movie Bunuel made in Spain, after his magnificent<br />\nViridiana (1961). Like that earlier film, to which it is<br />\noften compared, Tristana is about a young girl (Deneuve),<br />\nward to an elderly Don (Fernando Rey), whose paternal<br />\nfeelings mix freely with those of a husband. Both father<br />\nand husband to Tristana, he dominates the girl and<br />\ninfluences her adoption of his own hedonistic lifestyle. As<br />\nin the Galdos novel from which it is taken, Bunuel's film<br />\nmercilessly points out a double standard: a man can have<br />\nboth sexual license and social position, while a woman<br />\nmust repress her sexuality; to express it would bring<br />\nabout her social downfall.<br />\nTristana flees, but then, ill, and with an amputated leg,<br />\nshe returns, a cruel, ruthless mistress. This innocent<br />\nwoman, seduced and physically marred, takes her<br />\nvengeance. As in Belle du Jour, the woman in Tristana<br />\nsuffers in a male-dominated society, unable to express her<br />\nsexuality or achieve any status other than marital; and in<br />\nsexually perverse<br />\neach film the woman avenges herself in<br />\nways.<br />\nBunuel, characteristically, offers this tale of moral<br />\nmoralizing: \"( Tristana<br />\ndegradation without himself<br />\nmy films: eroticism,<br />\nin<br />\nconcerns) the same themes as all<br />\nto showing things<br />\nmyself<br />\nlimit<br />\nand religion.

The<br />\nseries is designed to present a forum for American and<br />\ninternational new music. The Fine Arts Committee has<br />\nrecently joined the International Festival of Disappearing<br />\nArt(s), a series of performances of the old and new arts<br />\nwith participants in Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, London,<br />\nToronto, and Baltimore. Two events are upcoming for<br />\nthis semester as part of the series: Lol Coxhill will be<br />\nperforming in the Glass Pavilion on December 6th, and<br />\nthe first Baltimore Festival of Disappearing Art(s),<br />\nfeaturing Fred Frith, CoAccident, and Mama Dada 1919<br />\nwill be held in the Listening Viewing Room on December<br />\n16th. Plans for next semester include concerts by<br />\nYochk'o Seffer and Neffesh Music from France, the Art<br />\nBears and National Health both from England, Daevid<br />\nAllen and Gong from Spain, and various national and<br />\nlocal performing artists of merit.<br />\nLol Coxhill will be making his first U.S. appearance at<br />\n8:00 p.m. on December 6th in the Glass Pavilion. Lol's<br />\nsaxophone playing is renowned in Europe as a leading<br />\nforce in the modern jazz scene. He is well known in rock<br />\ncircles as well, and his name crops up on numberous and<br />\nvaried albums by such artists as Kevin Ayers, Henry Cow,<br />\nand the Damned. Despite a ten year string of solo and<br />\ncollaborative albums he is still virtually unrecognized in<br />\nthis country except by leading American jazz musicians<br />\nand foreign music buffs. There will be both chair and rug<br />\nseating available for the concert and the audience is<br />\nadvised to bring their own refreshments.<br />\nFred Frith will be making a rare appearance in this<br />\ncountry on December 16th in the Listening-Viewing<br />\nRoom as part of the first Baltimore Festival of the<br />\nDisappearing Art(s). Frith is known as one of the most<br />\ninnovative guitarists in music today. He has played with<br />\nHenry Cow, the Art Bears, Jade Warrior, Robert Wyatt,<br />\nand Brian Eno among others. He has also recorded solo<br />\nguitar works on his own and in collaboration with Derek<br />\nBailey, Gerry Fitzgerald, and Hans Reichel. His style is<br />\nsurely one of the most interesting in all of guitar. Two<br />\nguitars having 'various electronic, harmonic and percussive<br />\ndevices are used in the creation of the alternate sounds<br />\nand music that show the expanded limits of the guitar as a<br />\ncomposer's instrument. This will be a solo performance<br />\nand it is hoped that he will return to America in the<br />\nspring to play with the Art Bears at Hopkins.<br />\nAlso (dis)appearing will be an American group called<br />\nCoAccident. Their literature describes themselves as a<br />\n\"poetry music performance group, whose works include<br />\nvoices, electronics, acoustic instruments, texts, notations,<br />\nand improvisations.\" They include the three language<br />\nengineers Kirby Malone, Chris Mason, and Marshall Reese,<br />\nAlec Bernstein on prepared piano and boxes, Mitchell<br />\nPressman on double bass, Ro Malone on visuo-design, and<br />\nwhoever else they bring on stage with them. They have<br />\nperformed in Baltimore, Washington, New York,<br />\nMassachusetts, and Toronto. CoAccident is expected to<br />\ntour California this spring and Europe this fall. Their<br />\nwork is of a somewhat revolutionary and Dadaist nature;<br />\nit is a total experience which must be seen and heard.<br />\nThe press release from the third group states,\"group be<br />\nMama Dada 1919 claim ties their yugoslavian heritage.<br />\nMama Dada 1919 has performed at hopkins this year to<br />\nperson makes language different from animal, lower, or,<br />\ncase. no one knows they. The only comment available<br />\nfrom them is 'Dada is not what dadaists think but what<br />\ndadaists.' Traditional acoustic instruments are<br />\ncomplemented by the new sonic inventions (such as the<br />\nFrench Double-Reed Horn and the Egg-Prowno Guitar),<br />\nvocals, words, non-vocal words, and various visual media<br />\nto present a piece of modern music combining structures<br />\nwith the of. They be giving more concerts in the area in<br />\nthe future well recording album release year.\"<br />\nThe Festival will begin promptly at 8:00 p.m. The<br />\naudience is requested not to eat, drink, or smoke in the<br />\nL-V Room. The Fine Arts Committee needs your support<br />\nif they are to continue with their plans for next spring.<br />\nThere will be admission charges for these two events but<br />\nthe Committee hopes to bring the prices down to a<br />\nnominal sum for future projects if these are a success.<br />\nInterested persons are urged to contact the Committee at<br />\n467-9140 or 235-2376 if they would like to help,<br />\ncomment, or find information. A splendid time is<br />\nguaranteed for all.<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE 12 1 DECEMBER 1, 1978<br />\n<br />\nSteve<br />\nTop<br />\nTen<br />\nHas<br />\nNew<br />\nWave<br />\nRan all's<br />\nBeing a diehard rock fan, I like having the opportunity of<br />\nlisting my Top 10 albums of the year. It's as good a way<br />\nas any of briefly summing up this year's musical highlights<br />\nas I see them. So without further ado (and if anybody<br />\nreally cares), here they are:<br />\nThe Dictators(Asylum)<br />\n1.Bloodbrothers<br />\nThe boys from da Bronx cop my top spot. Dick<br />\nManitoba may not be the handsomest man in Rock,<br />\nbut as a frontman he's in a league<br />\nlike he claims he is,<br />\nall his own. Lead guitarist Ross the Boss makes overrated<br />\nheavy metal clowns like Fred Nugent pale by comparison.<br />\nAnd Adny Shernoff is the best songwriter to have<br />\nemerged from the New York underground scene. With<br />\nwinnerslike \"Top Ten\", the `Tators will surely win their<br />\nway into youi Top Ten if you give'em a chance.<br />\nElectrifying, kick-ass r'n'r at its finest. Dictators rule,<br />\nO.K.?<br />\n2. Genration X (Chysalis)<br />\nBlonde teen idol Billy Idol has got the finest voice on<br />\nthe British p-rock circuit, and this album is chock full of<br />\ncatchy, melodic anthems that'll really get your blood<br />\npumping. Bob Andrews' manic, staccato guitar chording<br />\nhas been known to incite mass pogo attacks. 'Your<br />\nGeneration\", a certified high energy classic, is as good as<br />\ntwo Crossroads. It's hard to imagine anyone constructing<br />\na better song than \"Kiss Me Deadly\" Bundles of great<br />\nsingles on this LP. I'm working my second copy now.<br />\n3. .Darkness, on the Edge of Town Bruce Springsteen<br />\n1(Columbia)<br />\nThe Boss has returned. Originally I wasn't overly<br />\nimpressed by this album but a phenomenal (as usual)<br />\nconcert and a few more listens changed my opinion.<br />\nSpruce !- td to be the touringest star this year. While<br />\ncll known bands (and I won't mention any<br />\ncert!.<br />\nnamc play for an hour and fifteen minutes, the E Street<br />\nBand delivers three and a half hours of rock solid<br />\nentertainment. Need I tell you about the album? In the<br />\nwords of Robert Duncan, Bruce is a lover - with a giant<br />\nrock and roll dick.<br />\n4.Give Em Enough Rope. the Clash (Epic)<br />\nSecond in Popularity only to Yes in England, the Clash<br />\nroar back with a stunning followup to their much<br />\nheralded debut LP. The mix is better this time around,<br />\nand you can understand a few more words (at least 3 per<br />\nsong). Still too raw for the shake-your-booty and<br />\nle t'sge t-mell ow crowds, but rockers will loyeem.<br />\nStrummer/Jones have replaced Jagger/Richards in the<br />\neyes of theBritish youth. What is America missing out on?<br />\nA hell of a lot. Pass the word: It's Clash time!<br />\n5. This Year's Model - Elvis Costello(Columbia)<br />\nAn artist as gifted and unique as Mr. Costello conies<br />\nalong about once a decade. The 50's had Presley, in the<br />\n60's it was Dylan, and now we have this homely,<br />\nbespectacled young man who sings some of the most<br />\nseething songs ever written. \"Radio Radio\" spelled his'<br />\nfeelings out all too clearly, and FM jocks stayed away in<br />\ndroves. A few less R & B throwaways and I would have<br />\nranked the album even higher. One thought: How long<br />\ncan Elvis remain angry when he's hanging out with<br />\nheartthrobs like Bebe Buell and making a million a yeaf?<br />\n6. Approved by ... The Motors(Virgin)<br />\nA real sleeper. Formed from the ashes of Ducks<br />\nDeluxe, a famed British pub rock band, the Motors, led<br />\nby Andy McMaster and Nick Garvey, hit the mark with<br />\ntheir second LP. Covering a variety of styles (including<br />\nsome Grassroots - type material!), they strive to avoid<br />\nbeing categorized as just another bunch of ugly faces. Side'<br />\n2 is extraordinary. \"Dreaming You Life Away\" and<br />\n\"Today\" are both masterpieces, intelligent and<br />\nimpeccably arranged. Two members recently split, and<br />\nthe Motors are now being reassembled. Don't count them<br />\nout.<br />\n7.Heaven Tonight - Cheap Trick (Epic)<br />\nThey may be the hottest thing going in Japan right<br />\nnow, but in the States, these Midwestern boys must still<br />\nplay the opening act routine. Rick Nielson might look like<br />\nHuntz Hall and act like a blooming idiot, but his<br />\nsongwriting ability and axemanship cannot be questioned.<br />\n\"Surrender\" and \"On the Radio\" got some limited airplay<br />\nthis summer. Lots more neat Beatlesque tunes where they<br />\ncame from too. Robin Zander is an extremely capable<br />\nlead vocalist.

The introductory<br />\nand concluding segments are myth, a comfortable frame<br />\nto hold the more realistic, main part of .the movie. These<br />\nmythological segments are rendered in child-like<br />\nanimation, with geometric shapes, heavy black lines, and<br />\ncrayon-colors. This is effective in evoking a sense of<br />\nprimitive art and also in sketching a creation myth the<br />\nway children would perceive it. The second type of<br />\nanimation, that of the actual story, is realistic and<br />\ndetailed. The rabbits are not of the Walt Disney variety<br />\n(humanized caricatures that we agree to call bunnies).<br />\nThese little critters are accuarately rendered right down to<br />\nie individual hairs on their noses; it is hard to avoid<br />\n<br />\ngoing to spend your five bucks on?<br />\nAnd just what is a \"new wave\" group anyway? The<br />\ngenre is so broad, the tag is ultimately meaningless. What<br />\ndoes Pere Ubu have in common with Generation X? What<br />\ndo the Shirts have in common with the Clash? Nothing<br />\nexcept for inspiration and the fact that they don't sell<br />\nmany records in the USA. Tom \"Technoflash\"Scholz sells<br />\nmore of his albums in an hour than these groups do in a<br />\nmonth. Rod Stewart probably spent more money last<br />\nnight than Pere Ubu made this year-.<br />\nIt's really unfortunate that the average rock fan thinks<br />\n\"new wave\" means creeps in black leather jackets, ripped<br />\nt-shirts, safety pins through noses, extreme acts of<br />\nviolence, and a general absence of musical ability. That<br />\nwas mainly London, about a year and a half ago.

Yet the animators occasionally return to. solid<br />\nstreaks of color to lend emotional impact to a scene. For<br />\ninstance, when one of the rabbits forsees the warren's<br />\ndoom in a field covered with blood and uprooted trees.<br />\nThe Lord of the Rings takes animation technology one<br />\nstep further with its technique of overlaying photography<br />\nwith animator's paint.

The villainous Orcs and Nazgul<br />\n(Ringwraiths) look enough like men to be played by<br />\ngrotesquely masked actors on real horses. In battle scenes<br />\npainted over with green and gray washes, these insidious<br />\nraiders with pea-green, rubber faces withmarachino cherry<br />\neyes, look like a cross between medieval knights and<br />\nregulars at the bar in Star Wars. The customers at the inn<br />\nwhere Frodo and Company spend the night are also<br />\ndrawn in this manner. These almost-photographic<br />\ndrawings startle the viewer; it's as though the Mona Lisa<br />\nhad changed the position of her lips. This overlayed<br />\nphotography is also used to good effect during the scenes<br />\nof wizardry; the flashes of color and light are the most<br />\nsensational effects since Fantasia. Finally, the painted<br />\nbackdrops of river valleys and fortresses project the<br />\nforceful natural beauty found in the Middle Earth<br />\ncalendars.<br />\n, Both Waters/zip Down and the Lord of the Rings stand<br />\nindependently as exquisite artistic creations, apart from<br />\ntheir merits of translating print into film.

The ethnographic data from these two<br />\ncase studies will then be brought to bear on a series of problems: how can phenomena<br />\nlike the incest taboo or initiation ceremonies be explained cross-culturally? How do<br />\napproaches based on evolutionary development, cultural ecology, structuralism,<br />\nfunctionalism, or symbolic analysis contribute to the explanation of human behavior?<br />\nWe will end by talking about the practice of anthropology in North America today.<br />\nTexts will include Wolf, The House of Lim, Malinowski, Argonauts of the Western<br />\nPacific, Levi-Strauss, Totemism, and a selection of reprints.<br />\nGrades will be based on essay examinations and short(5-page) papers.<br />\nDr. Ahern<br />\n7.648 Theory in Anthropology<br />\nA discussion of recent issues in theoretical anthropology, focused around three<br />\nmajor themes: 1) the problem of what kinds of explanations for human actions are<br />\nappropriate for anthropology, those used in the natural sciences, those used in<br />\ninterpietive disciplines, or some other; 2) what theories of meaning in language are<br />\nassumed implicitly or explicitly by various ethnographers; how do these different<br />\ntheories affect analysis; 3) what is the nature of conventional rules in society; distinct<br />\ntypes of rules; vagueness in rules; following rules in society. The first half of the course<br />\nwill involve readings in both theory and ethnography; the second half will be devoted<br />\nto the reanalysis of ethnographic accounts on the basis of the theoretical discussions<br />\nundertaken in the first half.<br />\n<br />\nHistory of Art<br />\n1.342 The Renaissance Without Madonnas<br />\n<br />\nDr. Verheyen<br />\n<br />\nThis course, which has never been given before, will deal with works of the<br />\nItalian and Northern Renaissance with an emphasis on non-religious art. Discussion<br />\nwill center on the question of the survival of pagan concepts and imagery during the<br />\nMiddle Ages and their rediscovery during the 15th and 16th centuries. The works<br />\ndiscussed will range from the decoration of marriage chests to Titiar.'s mythological<br />\npaintings done for Philip II of Spain.<br />\nReadings will include art historical texts and (to a greater extent) works of literature<br />\nfrom Ovid to Ariosto. Reading assignments will be about 100 pages per week (all in<br />\nEnglish). Two short papers will be required. No previous art history course is required<br />\nas prerequisite.<br />\nDr. Stanton<br />\n1.386 Modern Sculpture<br />\nModern Sculpture will follow the development of subject and technique in sculpture<br />\nfrom Rodin to the present. The course will require some reading but the emphasis will<br />\nbe placed on study of works of sculpture in the Hershhem and other museums within<br />\neasy reach.<br />\n<br />\nHistory of Science<br />\nDr. Haraway<br />\n14.373 Biology and Politics<br />\nThe course will focus on varieties of biological determinism in political debate,<br />\nespecially in debates about reproduction, the family, sexual roles, and human nature.<br />\nThe first third of the course is called \"Political Physiology: The Body as Technological<br />\nDevice.\" Using James Tiptree's science fiction (Star Songs of an Old Primate), and<br />\ncurrent popular health and self-improvment manuals(Man's Body: An Owner's Manual<br />\nand Woman's Body: An Owner's Manual) we will discuss history of<br />\n20th<br />\ncentury physiology and in e.dicine which help define our sense of our<br />\nplace in nature. The main themes will be ideologies of stress and<br />\nof stress and sexual<br />\nenergy.<br />\nThe second third of the course is called \"Birth Control, Feminism and the Family:<br />\nForces and Relations of Reproduction.\"We will explore alternative ways of<br />\napproaching the social and medical and political history of the birth control movement<br />\nin America in the 19th and 20th centuries. The book will be Woman's Body, Woman's<br />\nRight supplemented by Capitalism and the Family. We will also make use of From<br />\nPrivate Vice to Public Virtue, but the text is not yet in paperback.<br />\nThe last third of the course is called \"Evolutionary Theory and Population Biology:<br />\nThe Produce of History Is Human Nature.\" We will look at the debate on the relation<br />\nbetween population and resources in the 19th century (Malthus'Essay on the Principle<br />\nof Population, Norton Critical Edition). We will then consider eugenics (as biological<br />\ntheory and as political movement in America) and post-World War II population<br />\ncontrol movements. We will conclude with an exploration of sociobiology in the<br />\ndebate on the human being's place in nature and history. We will use Biology as a<br />\nSocial Weapon and selections from E.O. Wilson.<br />\n! Format will include both lecture and discussion. Students will be asked to complete<br />\ncourse reaf'ings in time for the discussions, write short papers based on the reading, and<br />\ntake an active part in determining the analysis and direction of the course. Books cost<br />\nIabout $10, but will also be available on reserve.<br />\n<br />\nNon-Departmental<br />\n70.382 Changing China<br />\nDr. Pfeifer<br />\nThis is the final course that I'll teach at Hopkins, after ten years here. If you<br />\ncannot from it learn \"the truth,\" you will learn how differently \"the truth\" can look.<br />\nThe course focuses on understanding domestic developments in China since 1949. It<br />\nbegins with a three-week introduction to the Chinese revolution. The bulk of the<br />\ncourse then deals with Maoist revolution between 1949 and Mao's death in 1976.<br />\n\"Changing China\" concludes with several weeks devoted to examining the post-Mao era<br />\nto determine whether the revolution is over. Comparisons with the United States<br />\nnecessarily are involved throughout.<br />\nAs in all my courses, I teach the particular materials of this one with several ulterior<br />\neducational motives. First, I hope to encourage students to develop two crucial skills,<br />\nwhich are an important part of what it means to be \"educated:\" the capacity to read<br />\ndifferent materials critically, and the capacity to write a clear, disciplined argument. I<br />\ndo this through .the seminar format, in which the basic arguments, assumptions an:1<br />\nunasked questions of the reading are drawn out, and through the assigning of and my<br />\ncommentaries upon short, argumentative papers. These pairers and my comments<br />\nconcerning both substantive points and argument structure are then discussed<br />\nindividually with students. Second, I try to communicate to students that there are<br />\nvisions of the world other than the liberal-caiiitalist one, with which we have all been<br />\nthoroughly indoctrinated, and that these other visions may tell us vital things about<br />\nour world and ourselves. Third, I encourage students to work together to further their<br />\nunderstanding. My overall aim in teaching is to contribute to stur.!ents' capacity to<br />\nthink for themselves and to understand the world as it exists.<br />\nThe readings, most of which are listel below, average about 200 pages per week.<br />\nTwo four-page papers and a final ten-page paper are assigned. In addi-ion to the<br />\nreadings, the papers, and class discussion, we will play a simulation game called Star<br />\nPower; I will present a slide show on art and politics; and one or more movies will be<br />\nshown. For writing papers, students will be organized into small discussion groups so<br />\nthey can benefit from each other's ideas and arguments as they work out, organize and<br />\ncompose their own. No exams. No prerequisites.<br />\nBooks to be read in whele or part: William Hinton, Fanshen; John G.

Some<br />\nattention will be given at the outset to the nature of moral problems and judgements,<br />\n'to skeptical challenges to rational argument in ethics, and to the similarities and<br />\ndifferences among moral, scientific, and medical judgments and the place or rationality<br />\nin each. Next, the moral and social dimensions of the physician-patient relation will be<br />\nexplored. Emphasis will be placed on the notion of personal care, and the implications<br />\nand possible qualifications of the notion will be considered in subsequent discussion of<br />\na select number of moral problems. Among these will be: placebo therapy,<br />\nexperimentation on human subjects, appropriate responses to refusal of life-saving<br />\ntreatment for religious reasons, persons choosing to die, and the treatment of defective<br />\nnewborn infants.<br />\nThe class will have a lecture-discussion format with assistant-led discussion sections.<br />\nFilms and outside speakers will be used to stimulate discussion.

But it<br />\nrepresents a continuation of trends unwelcome to<br />\nundergraduates seeking a broad education. Although few<br />\ndepartments arc above reproach, among the worst examples<br />\nof inadequate offerings for non-majors are in the<br />\ndepartments of Anthropology (4 courses) and Near Eastern<br />\nStudies (5 courses). These two cases are unfortunate not<br />\nonly due to the low number of offerings, but also because<br />\ngood general courses on topics such as Physical<br />\nAnthropology or the Origins of Civilization could be of<br />\nconsiderable interest to any student with even the slightest<br />\ninterest in the history of man.<br />\nThe list of Intersession courses this year is a joke. Except<br />\nfor courses in Psychology and the Writing Seminars,<br />\nopportunities are nominal or non-existent. Most faculty<br />\nand administrators don't give a damn about Intersession.<br />\nCourse selection is consistently sparse at Hopkins because<br />\nthe faculty makes it that way. While sonic professors are<br />\nquite enthusiastic about teaching, too many do only the<br />\nminimum required for them to get by in their department.<br />\nThe student apathy that some professors say make<br />\nundergraduates uninteresting<br />\nto teach is frequently a<br />\nreflection of the way the faculty members themselves<br />\napproach their courses.<br />\nHowever, the basic source of the problem is not ill will or<br />\nindolence by professors. The problem is a system which<br />\nstrongly discourages efforts towards teaching. This is<br />\nespecially true for junior faculty, who could otherwise be<br />\nthe most eager to educate undergrads. But the way things<br />\nare now, why should \u2022 they waste their time and energy?<br />\nJust like students, they can hardly afford to work on<br />\nprojects for which they get no credit. Teaching receives no<br />\ncredit in tenure decisions. Only research counts. Course<br />\ndevelopment is valuable and constructive, and must be<br />\nconsidered in the evaluation of a tenure candidate's work.<br />\nThe conservative faculty forces which oppose this proposal<br />\nimplicitly view undergraduate students as a necessary<br />\ninconvenience to be endured at this University.<br /><br />\nGood Art Work<br />\nThe J.H.U. Fine Arts Committee will be presenting<br />\nsaxophonist Lol Coxhill and guitarist Fred Frith in solo<br />\nconcerts at Hopkins on December 6th and 16th<br />\nrespectively. This will be Coxhill's first performance ever in<br />\nAmerica and only Frith's second, but both musicians have<br />\nstrong, established reputations in Europe despite their<br />\nAmerican obscurity. The organizers of these concerts, who<br />\nare Hopkins undergraduates, arc bringing these<br />\nacknowledged masters to America...and to Hopkins. The<br />\nCommittee is making major strides towards establishing<br />\nHopkins as a center for progressive music in America. The<br />\nopportunity to experience this new and different type of<br />\nmusic is extraordinary. Congratulations to the Fine Arts<br />\nCommittee for bringing this reknowncd talent to Hopkins.<br />\nThe event deserves support from anyone who has a mild<br />\ninterest in any style of music.<br /><br />\nLittle Big Loss<br /><br />\nThe adminstration has just. proposed to convert the Little<br />\nTheatre in Levering into office space. Such a move would<br />\nhurt; the loss of this comfortable spot used for Chester's<br />\nPlace and various local theatrical producations, would he<br />\ndetrimental to the alrea4 slumbering student social life.<br />\nAlternatives are always available for any decision, if you<br />\njust look hard enough for them.

As another from that<br />\nflock of beleaguered species I can<br />\nmake no corrections to what Mr.<br />\nErcolano has written, only<br />\nseveral additions:<br />\n1. Bali imoreans can't drive.<br />\n2. Commuters have to buy<br />\ngasoline. At sixty-six cents<br />\ngallon for self serve the<br />\ncommuter not only gets robbed<br />\nbut gets to smell the gas on his<br />\nhands all morning. (Yes, you<br />\nsheltered dormies, sixty-six cents<br />\nfor lead-free and I buy it in the<br />\nsuburbs. Premium gas, not self<br />\nserve, is pushing eighty cents in<br />\nthe city.)<br />\n3. Baltimoreans can't drive in<br />\nthe rain.<br />\n4. Mr. Ercolano neglected to<br />\nmention the fun of sliding into<br />\nschool on a snowy morning. This<br />\npast winter was the worst since<br />\nthere was more snow than ever<br />\nand the plows were out either<br />\ntoo early or too late.<br />\n5. Baltimoreans can't drive in<br />\nthe snow.<br />\n6. If a domiie forgets an<br />\nassignment at his place of<br />\nresidence he can run back and<br />\nhell be just two minutes late for<br />\nclass. If a commuter forgets an<br />\nassignment, he can take the lower<br />\ngrade or he can take a trip home<br />\n(half an hour in each chi ection in<br />\nmy case) and get it.<br />\n7. Baltimorearip can't drive on<br />\na perfectly clear day with the sun<br />\nshining.<br />\n8. And if a dormie needs to do<br />\nresearch or get some quiet<br />\nstudying done, D Level and the<br />\nHut are just a short stroll away.<br />\nThe commuter has to face an<br />\nexhausting trip in Baltimore<br />\ntraffic or wait until the family<br />\ngets to sleep at midnight before<br />\neverything is quiet.<br />\n9. Those Baltimoreans who<br />\ncan drive are in constant<br />\ntiepidation of city, county and<br />\nstate cops who want to restrict<br />\nthem whenever possible.<br />\n10.

The Gam<br />\nbrothers had taken preventive<br />\nmeasures to put an end to this<br />\nimpish joke by securely bolting<br />\nthe frames to the wall with<br />\nseveral four inch lag bolts.

During<br />\nthe ensuing years, however,<br />\nadherence to the spirit and the<br />\nletter of the Ethics Code has<br />\nbeen minimal,Though the causes<br />\nmay be manyfold, the lax<br />\nimplementation of the Ethics<br />\nCode is probably due in large<br />\npart to the fact that a pleat<br />\nportion of the students 'and<br />\nfaculty are unaware of the<br />\nprovisions of the Code and the<br />\nworkings of the Ethics Beard. It<br />\nis the intention of this letter to<br />\nserve as an introduction to the<br />\nBoard's procedures and policies.<br />\nIn the Hopkins community,<br />\nboth the students and the faculty<br />\nare responsible for minimizing<br />\nviolations of academic integrity,<br />\ni.e. cheating, plagiarism,<br />\nfalsification, etc., and for<br />\nreporting them to the Ethics<br />\nBoard. The course instructors<br />\nmay handle violations on their<br />\nown or request that the Ethics<br />\nBoard appoint a hearing panel to<br />\ndetermine the student's guilt or<br />\ninnocence, and if necessary, an<br />\nappropriate penalty. In turn, the<br />\nstudent accused of a violation<br />\nmay either accept the decision<br />\nsuggested by the instructor, or he<br />\nmay be the one to request a<br />\nhearing panel if he is unsure of<br />\nreceiving an impartial decision<br />\nfrom his instructor. Penalties<br />\nassessed by the Board are not<br />\nnecessarily more severe than<br />\nthose meted out by individual<br />\ncrofessors. It should be<br />\nemphasized that one of the<br />\nimportant functions of the Ethics<br />\nBoard is to protect the students'<br />\nright to fair treatment.<br />\nThe Board's work, however, is<br />\nnot limited to holding hearings.<br />\nCont. on p. 5<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER / PAGE 5<br /><br />\nOpinion<br /><br />\nWalters Questions Carter's Anti-Inflation Guidelines<br />\nDr. Alan A.

He currently works for<br />\nthe World Bank.<br />\n\u2022 Inflation is a persistent rise<br />\nin the general level of prices--now<br />\nmounting to about 8 percent a<br />\nyear in the United States. And<br />\ninflation is caused by \"too much<br />\nmoney chasing too few goods\"<br />\n(this old chestnut is perfectly<br />\nsound). Inflation will be greater<br />\nthe larger the increases on the<br />\nquantity of money and the<br />\nsmaller the increase in the<br />\nquantity of goods.<br />\nGovernment has had a hand in<br />\nboth increasing the amount of<br />\nmoney and restricting the<br />\nquantity of goods. During 1977-8<br />\nthe government paid for growing<br />\ngovernment spending, not<br />\nprimarily with taxes or<br />\ngovernment borrowing from the<br />\npublic, but by printing dollar<br />\nnotes and issuing its own<br />\npromises-to-pay.<br />\nAlthough the government<br />\n(President,Congress and the<br />\nFederal Reserve Board), has<br />\ncaused the great inflation of<br />\n1977-8, they are quick in<br />\ndenying any substantial<br />\nresponsibility. (The President<br /><br />\nhimself has said that he is against<br />\ninflation, so how can he be<br />\nblamed?) The real culprits, it is<br />\nsaid, are the greedy trade unions,<br />\nrapacious businessmen, grasping<br />\nforeigners, such as oily sheiks,<br />\nand the Almighty (through<br />\nplagues, fib )ls, etc.). Apart from<br />\nprayer, which fortunately has a<br />\nlow marginal cost, although<br />\ndoubtful marginal product, one<br />\ncan do little about natural<br />\ncalamities. And one can do little<br />\nabout foreigners. (However I<br />\ndon't see why the United States<br />\nshould enter into commodity<br />\nagreements and import<br />\nrestrictions--on textiles for<br />\nexample --which drive up the<br />\nprices on domestic market and<br />\nimpoverish poor people in the<br />\nUnited States and East Asia). But<br />\nGeorge Meany and Henry Ford<br />\n(III) are Americans and so can be<br />\n'guided' or controlled by the<br />\nPresident and his staff of<br />\ndoughty inflation fighters. At<br />\npresent only 'guidelines' are<br />\ndeployed; any perspicacious<br />\nobserver will anticipate that if<br />\nthe voluntary guidelines are seen<br />\nto be ineffective, regulation of<br />\nprices and wages will soon<br />\nfollow.<br />\nIt is \"Catch-22.\" Since<br />\neveryone will anticipate<br />\nmandatory controls all<br />\nbusinessmen and union leaders<br />\nwill be increasing their prices and<br /><br />\nwages much more rapidly than<br />\nthey normally would, in<br />\nanticipation of the wage and<br />\nprice 'freeze' (a la Nixon 1971)<br />\nto come during this winter. \"Get<br />\n'em up now\" is heard, loud in the<br />\nland. And as we see the present<br />\nescalation of prices and wages, in<br />\nanticipation of the freeze, it will<br />\nbe widely argued that voluntary<br />\ncontrols have failed. The big stick<br />\nmust be wielded to contain price<br />\nand wage demands. And of<br />\ncourse there will then be a magic<br />\neffect of mandatory methods;<br />\nprices and wages, having<br />\nincreased at a tremendous lick<br />\nduring the anticipatory periods<br />\nwill then pause. The regulators<br />\nwill congratulate themselves on<br />\nbeing 'realistic' but 'tough,' fair'<br />\nbut 'flexible,' and so on.<br />\nSuch guidelines and controls,<br />\nif effective, make the inflation<br />\nworse. They reduce the quantity<br />\nof goods available for sale,<br />\ncreating shortages and black<br />\nmarkets. This shortage has<br />\noacurred already with natural<br />\ngas--the price of which has been<br />\nregulated for many years.<br />\nAmerican firms find it<br />\nunprofitable to produce natural<br />\ngas and switch their energies to<br />\nother pursuits; meanwhile the<br />\nlimited quantity of gas still<br />\nflowing has to be rationed and<br />\naugmented by imports of energy<br />\nfrom Arab kingdoms. In view of<br /><br />\nthe impending deregulation of<br />\nnatural gas one would have<br />\nthought that the President had<br />\nlearned one important lesson--but<br />\nI would not bet on that.<br />\nPosturing and pusillanimity<br />\nrather than reason and reflection<br />\nseem to be the hallmarks of the<br />\npresent administration.<br />\nAttempting to reduce inflation<br />\nby price and wage controls is like<br />\ntrying to stop a house<br />\noverheating by breaking all the<br />\nthermostats instead of reducing<br />\nthe fire in the furnace. The<br />\noverheating of the economy is<br />\ndue to the too rapid expansion of<br />\nthe money supply--brought about<br />\nlargely by too rapid an increase<br />\nin spending by the Federal<br />\ngovernment. There are some<br />\nhopeful signs that, at long last,<br />\nthe money supply is being<br /><br />\nbrought under suitably tight<br />\ncontrol and the Federal deficit is,<br />\nat least, being reviewed with<br />\nsuitable alarm. However, the<br />\nnaive view that virtually all<br />\nimportant problems could be<br />\nsolved by throwing sufficient<br />\nFederal money at them is bruised<br />\nand battered but not dead. It<br />\ngenerated the great American<br />\ninflation which began in 1963<br />\nand, I suspect, has many more<br />\nyears to run. My main fear is that<br />\nthe despairing attempts to deal<br />\nwith the symptoms of inflation,<br />\nby mandatory controls, will<br />\ndestroy some of the most<br />\nimportant freedoms, already<br />\nsadly eroded, which were<br />\nfashioned two centuries ago by<br />\nthose prodigious Founding<br />\nFathers.<br /><br />\n.4=114.1=WOMIN<br /><br />\nWelcome Back!<br />\nWhile you were away this summer<br />\nA Great New Disco has opened in Towson<br /><br />\nDISCOTHEQUE &amp; BACKGAMMON CLUB<br />\nLoch Raven Plaza<br /><br />\nekfteatistatalleeMOMONOWINWOMOMONANIMOIMMONOMMOM<br /><br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS NIGHT<br />\nEvERy WEdNEsday NighT<br />\n\u2014 vrommoomorammoreameasonommommoommwo<br />\nBring this ad or present your College ID<br />\nfor reduced admission charge of only $1.00<br />\nDress\u2014 Like A Star\"<br />\nSTRICTLY F NFORCED\u2014No Jeans, Tennis Shoes, Sandals<br />\nTube Tops.

One<br />\nstudent among those working to<br />\nrestore day shifts stated that the<br />\nUnion meeting scheduled for<br />\nearly next week is a definite<br />\nfactor in the postponement. The<br />\nannouncement has already been<br />\npostponed twice since its original<br /><br />\nN FIEDS<br />\nCLASSI<br /><br />\nas \"off-the record\".<br />\nConsequently, anyone who<br />\nopenly exploits such forbidden<br />\nknowledge may<br />\nbe viewed as<br />\ndishonest.<br />\nBecause the study measured<br />\nthe ability to receive and convey<br />\nnon-verbal signals associated with<br />\nWestern cultures, those people<br />\nwho come from other societies<br />\nand whose language was not<br />\nrelated to English performed<br />\nworse than other subjects.<br />\nSensitivity also varied according<br />\nto occupation, with actors<br />\ncoming out on top and<br />\nexecutives near the bottom.<br />\nDr. Hall stressed that the result<br />\nof any non-verbal<br />\ncommunication studies cannot be<br />\na dictionary of signals, for they<br />\nvary according to culture,<br />\nsituational context, and personal<br />\nidiosyncrasies. Many non-verbal<br />\ncommunication self-help books<br />\nmade this mistake she said.<br />\nSuch works also suffer from a<br />\nkey contradiction, according to<br />\nDr. Hall. They say that since non<br />\nverbal signals are involuntary,<br />\none can manipulate them to his<br />\nown advantage. However, if such<br />\nmessages are uncontrolable, then<br />\nthe person cannot systematically<br />\nuse them to exploit others.<br /><br />\ndate of Tuesday, November 21st.<br />\nTomorrow the group of<br />\nconcerned students will present<br />\npetitions to Dr. Zdanis urging<br />\nthat the decision be reversed.

Smith,<br />\nProfessor of Microbiology at the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool, and Dr. Daniel Nathans, Director of the<br />\nDepartment of Microbiology at Johns Hopkins, were<br />\nnamed winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine. They<br />\nshared this honor with Dr. Werner Arber of Switzerland.<br />\nThe Johns Hopkins microbiologists received their<br />\nawards for research investigating the nature of sitespecific restriction enzymes. Their discoveries have<br />\nprovided scientists with the means for unlocking the<br />\nsecrets of DNA.<br />\nBacteria produce restriction enzymes to provide<br />\nprotection against viruses. When viruses invade bacterial<br />\ncell walls, the restriction enzymes cut the viral DNA into<br />\nnumerous fragments. To protect themselves from having<br />\ntheir. own DNA destroyed, bacteria utilize specific<br />\nmethylated enzymes to provide a protective coating.<br />\nDr. Smith discovered the first site-specific restriction<br />\nenzyme and its corresponding methylase. His<br />\nexperimental findings provided verification of Werner<br />\nArber's theories concerning the existence of restriction<br />\nenzymes.<br />\nRestriction enzymes allow DNA to be cut into<br />\nfragments in specific sites. Through this technique the<br />\norder of genes on the chromosome and their chemical<br />\nstructure may be determined. New combinations of genes<br />\nmay be created in the laboratory. The increased<br />\nknowledge obtained by the use of these \"chemical<br />\nknives\" provides molecular biologists and geneticists with<br />\nthe mechanism which may solve many problems in<br />\nbiology and medicine.<br />\nQ: Would you summarize the significance of the<br /><br />\nresearch for which .you received the Nobel Prize?<br />\nA: My accomplishment is rather simple. Namely in the<br />\nperiod of 1968 to 1970 when 1 was a new faculty member<br />\nhere at Johns Hopkins Medical School. a postdoctoral<br />\nstudent and I discovered a cleavage site specific restriction<br />\nenzyme. It was the first one that had ever been found.<br />\nI think that it was important in the way that we<br />\npresented the work. We displayed a very complete picture<br />\nin two articles appeasing in the Journal of Molecular<br />\nBiology in 1970. One was a detailed description of the<br />\nenzyme in which we proved its specificity by actually<br />\ndetermining the sequence of nucleotides in DNA that was<br />\nrecognized by the enzyme. The other showed where the<br />\ncleavage sites were located.<br />\nInstead of just publishing many short papers we<br />\npresented the entire thing at One time; and this made it<br />\nclear to everyone. particularly biochemists and biologists.<br />\nthat here was an enzyme that cleaved exactly in a<br />\nparticular sequence of DNA. It was now obvious that you<br />\ncould cut DNA into specific fragments.<br />\nQ: it<br />\nwas the relationship between your reseanli<br /><br />\nand that performed by Drs. Werner Arber and Daniel<br />\nNat/tans?<br />\nA: Prior to my investigations, Werner Arber, a<br />\ngeneticist, had written a paper describing another type of<br />\nrestriction enzyme that was not cleavage site-specific. He<br />\nlaid the foundations for the existence of these enzymes.<br />\nDr. Arber studied phage restriction and modification in<br />\nbacteria, and he induced from his observations that there<br />\nmust exist a site-specific enzyme. He presumed it would<br />\nbe an endonuclease. Dr. Arber also believed that there<br />\nwould be a site-specific modification enzyme that would<br />\nprotect against the restriction enzyme cleavage. In a<br />\nreview in 1965, he clearly stated that there were probably<br />\nsite-specific endonuclease modification enzymes.<br />\nIn the closing paragraphs of that review he speculated<br />\non future developments, and he stated that he thought<br />\nthat these enzymes would become useful tools in DNA<br />\nsequence work. He, therefore, really saw what was to<br />\ncome.<br />\nWe were fortunate to have Dr. Daniel Nathans here at<br />\nHopkins at the time of out discovery of a cleavage<br />\nsite-specific restriction enzyme. Dr. Nathans had a<br />\nparticular problem that could not be worked out by<br />\nstandard genetics and was looking for another approach.<br />\nHe employed restriction enzyme to cut DNA from<br />\nsimian virus 40 into numerous fragments and was able to<br />\nidentify the pattern of genes of this virus responsible for<br />\ninitiating tumor-producing protein.<br />\nQ: Since your initial discovery of site-specific<br />\nrestriction enzymes, what investigations have you been<br />\npursuing?<br />\nA: Immediately after we finished the restriction<br /><br />\nenzyme work, I suggested to one of the graduate student<br />\nthat he look at DNA methylases because many workers in<br />\nthe field at the time were saying that we really do not<br />\nknow if some of these site-specific enzymes are truly<br />\nrestriction enzymes. Such enzymes must have a<br />\nmodification enzyme of the same specificity in order to<br />\nqualify as a restriction enzyme, because<br />\nrestriction-modification systems are made up of two<br />\nenzymes acting at the same time. We experimented with DNA methylase and eventually<br />\nfound four different adenine methylases in the strain of<br />\nbacteria that we were working with. One of these<br />\nprotected against cleavage by our restriction enzyme, and<br />\nproved to be the modification enzyme which satisfied the<br />\nnecessary biological requirements.<br />\nSubsequently, we found another methylase which<br />\nprotected DNA against cleavage. This led to the discovery<br />\nof a second enzyme which we had not previously<br />\nrecognized.<br />\nQ: Have you continued to work with these restriction<br />\nenzymes in recent years.'<br /><br />\nNot only is it the basic building block of<br />\nA: We are still working with restriction s enzymes. I<br />\nwould classify most of our subsequent work as being kind<br />\nof \"routine.\" It has potential which has not been fully<br />\nrealized. We are concentrating on using the restriction and<br />\nmodification enzymes as model systems for studying<br />\nsequence recognition by proteins.<br />\nThere are a great variety of enzymes which recognize<br />\nspecific nucleotide sequences. What we want to do is<br />\ndetermine the mechanism by which a given enzyme will<br />\nfit a particular nucleotide site and recognize it very<br />\naccurately.<br />\nOur approach to this problem has been through the use<br />\nof base analogs by chemically modifying various groups<br />\non the nucleotides, and seeing what effect that might have<br />\non the enzyme activity. Then one may ask the question:<br />\nIs a particular group --let's say on the guanine<br />\nring--involved in recognition or not? You can remove the<br />\ngroup or you can insert a modifying group to determine<br />\nwhat effect it has on activity or on binding. We have<br />\nlooked mainly at activity.<br />\nQ: Were you aware of the fact that you were being<br />\nconsidered for the Nobel Prize?<br />\nA: I did not have any prior knowledge. I really did not<br />\nknow that I was even being considered. It has been eight<br />\nyears since the original work was published. I cannot<br />\nthink of any single year where it ever occurred to me that<br />\nI should take special note of the news during the month<br />\nof October!<br />\nI knew that the work had had a big impaCt in the field,<br />\nbut I never sat back and said,\"Gee, they ought to give me<br />\na Nobel Prize for it.\" However, some people had told me<br />\nthat I might get one some day. Some investigators do<br />\nextremely elegant and brilliant pieces of work requiring a<br />\ngreat deal of intellectual effort. This work we did for the<br />\nfun of it, and it sort of fell together. At the same time we<br />\ndid not realize that it was going to be that important. It<br />\nwas a nice piece of work, but we did not have a clear<br />\nnotion that a large part of future research in this field<br />\nwould depend on our findings.<br />\nQ: How were you notified that you had won the prize?.<br />\nA: I can remember it vividly! It was about 8:50 A.M. in<br />\nthe morning and I was having a cup of coffee with mY<br />\nwife. The children had already gone to school, and I was<br />\njust gathering up my papers. I was almost ready to go out<br />\nthe door when the telephone rang. My wife picked it up<br />\nand said, \"Hold it a minute. It is the Associated Press.''<br />\nShe thought that the call was about the recombinant<br />\nDNA hearings in Washington, and that the reporters<br />\nwanted to get my viewpoint. I said,\"Okay, give it to me.'<br />\nThe Associated Press said that they had just received<br />\nword on the wire service that I had been awarded the<br />\nNobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. The co-winners<br /><br />\n1E NOT IVY LEAGUE!!!<br />\nDr. Hamilton 0.Smith by Roger Blumenthal<br /><br />\n'ng block oflift -- but it 's 90 proof to boot!<br /><br />\nwere Drs. Daniel Nathans and Werner Arber..<br />\nI was actually speechless. After recovering control of<br />\nmy thoughts, I turned to my wife and reported what the<br />\nA.P. representative had just told me. The reporter tried to<br />\ninterview me at this point, but I could not give very<br />\ncoherent answers to his questions. After about fifteen<br />\nminutes, he said, \"Thank you, Dr. Smith.\" The telephone<br />\nrang immediately again, and it was another news service.<br />\nBy that time, I was a little more composed and was<br />\nable to provide more background information. I was not<br />\neven positive for what work I had been awarded the prize.<br />\nThere were several more calls after that, and<br />\nsubsequently, I left my wife toanswer the telephone.<br />\nWhen I arrived at the medical school, the place was<br />\ngoing berserk! There were crowds of people standing in<br />\nthe halls. When I got to my office, there was a big sign<br />\nsaying Congratulations. Everyone in East Baltimore<br />\napparently got the word before I did. I just thank God<br />\nthat I did not hear it on the car radio or I probably would<br />\nhave been wrapped around a telephone pole somewhere.<br />\nQ: Are you making preparations to deliver your<br />\nacceptance speech?<br />\nA: Yes, I certainly am. It is traditional to review and<br />\ngive a personal account of the research that resulted in the<br />\nprize. I am certainly going to do that in the opening<br />\nparagraphs.<br />\nMy main emphasis, however, is going to be on our<br />\ninterests in gene sequence recognition and the use of these<br />\nenzymes as model systems.<br />\nApparently there is no restriction in what one talks<br />\nabout in these lectures. I have noticed that some of the<br />\npast laureates who spoke (fifteen or twenty years after<br />\ncompleting their work) selected a subject which was not<br />\nreally closely related to the investigation that resulted in<br />\nthe prize. For example, Watson and Crick did not get up<br />\nand describe the structure of DNA, since it was \"old<br />\nstuff\" by the time that they received their awards. One<br />\nspoke about protein synthesis and the other talked about<br />\nthe genetic code.<br />\nQ: Are you satisfied with the National Institute of<br />\nHealth guidelines concerning recombinant DNA?<br />\nA: No, I am not. I think that they are much too<br />\nstringent. My feeling is that a majority of the scientists<br />\nnow are thinliing that the guidelines need to be relaxed.<br />\nThat is the direction in which things are going. The<br />\n, revised guidelines which have been under consideration in<br />\nthe past year will be considerably less restrictive.<br />\nQ: Some of the fears that concern opponents of DNA<br />\nresearch are that recombinant strains of bacteria would be<br />\nresistant to antibiotics, completely new types of bacteria<br />\nwould be produced, and increases in various forms of<br /><br />\ncancer would occur. Some feel that these effects would<br />\nnot show up for many years. What is your view about the<br />\npossibility ofsuch catastrophes taking place?<br />\nA: I can only give you my opinion. That is one of the<br />\nproblems in the entire controversy. One can only give<br />\nopinions. There is no basis for any firm statements.<br />\nOne person says that he thinks it is dangerous; the<br />\nother investigator says that he thinks it is safe, and no one<br />\ncan refute either opinion. I do not think that any of these<br />\nhorrible things will occur.<br />\nNature has alrea'dy carried out as many recombinations<br />\nas it can; it has already tried to fill all the niches, and I do<br />\nnot think that we are going to discover any new ones.<br />\nThis is just an intuitive feeling. It is just an opinion, and I<br />\nam certain that another person with a different viewpoint<br />\nmight say that if someone went oeit of his way to take a<br />\ntoxic gene and splice it into an innocuous bacterium that<br />\ninhabits man without producing disease, (let's say that<br />\nyou took the diptheria toxin gene and stuck it into E.<br />\nColi) maybe he could produce something that would be<br />\ndangerous.<br />\nmaintain no responsible investigator would be foolish<br />\nenough to do this.<br />\nQ: Do you foresee much use of genetic engineering in<br />\nthe coming years on human beings?<br />\nA: The injection of recombinant DNA into man to give<br />\nnew characteristics interests some. It may be employed to<br />\ncorrect existing defects, but I think that it is real science<br />\nfiction at this point to think that you could turn some<br />\naverage guy into a Beethoven by placing the right set of<br />\ngenes into him. We really do not know very much about<br />\nwhat makes one person superior to another one.<br /><br />\nDetroit. During this period I became very interested in the<br />\nrapidly developing field of genetics. It was my good<br />\nfortune to obtain a research appointme:it in the<br />\nDepartment of Human Genetics at the University of<br />\nMichigan.<br />\nQ: When did you return to Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool?<br />\nA: After five years at the University of Michigan, I<br />\ncame to Hopkins as an assistant professor in 1967. I was<br />\npromoted to full professor of Microbiology in 1973.<br />\nQ: In the book Who Should Play God?lby Ted Howard<br />\nand Jeremy Rifkin, it is stated that restriction enzymes<br />\nare commercially available and may be obtained by<br />\nanyone who wishes to purchase them. The authors<br />\ndescribe sensational advertising which could encourage<br />\nany high school student to set up a recombinant DNA lab<br />\nin his own home. Do you believe that the average high<br />\nschool student could become involved in manipulations<br />\nwith recombinant DNA?<br />\nA: Yes, any high school student could do this. You can<br />\nbuy restriction enzymes and you can even buy DNA. It is<br />\neasy to mix the two in a test tube along with the proper<br />\nbuffer. It is relatively easy to work with these substances<br />\nand produce recombinant DNA. Then this can be<br />\nintroduced into E. coli organisms and become<br />\nincorporated into bacteria.<br />\nQ What is your opinion about the recent book which<br />\ndescribes the cloning ofa human being?<br />\nA: That is pure hogwash! Only in lower animals has<br />\nthis process been successful.<br />\nQ: What do you anticipate will be the directions which,<br />\nresearch in DNA molecular biology will take in the next<br /><br />\nQ: Does adequate technology exist for changing the<br />\ngenes of man?<br />\nA: I do not think it is practical now. It might be<br />\npossible to replace a gene defect in a limited sort of way,<br />\nbut to change one gene for another does not seem to me<br />\nto be at all feasible.<br />\nQ: Where did you receive your undergraduate<br />\neducation and medical training?<br />\nA: I attended the University of Illinois for two years<br />\nwith the intention of majoring in mathematics. In my<br />\njunior year I transferred to the University of California at<br />\nBerkeley. By this time I had decided that biological<br />\nresearch with a particular emphasis on neurophysiology<br />\nwas the field tilat interested me most.<br />\nIn 1952 I was admitted into the Johns Hopkins Medical<br />\nSchool. I must admit that during my medical school days,<br />\nI probably spent more time reading scientific journals<br />\nthan the basic textbooks.<br />\nAfter finishing medical school I interned at Barnes<br />\nHopsital in St. Louis. Following service in the navy I was<br />\nappointed resident in medicine at the Ford Hospital in<br /><br />\nfew years?<br />\nA: I believe there will be extensive commercial<br />\napplications to produce protein products which are of<br />\ntherapeutic value in humans. I see continued study of<br />\nDNA sequences and basic research progress in this field.<br />\nThere undoubtedly will be advances in determining the<br />\nstructure of genes. I expect that some type of gene<br />\ntherapy will eventually be successful, although I am not<br />\ncertain what particular genetic defects might be<br />\nsusceptible to treatment.<br />\nIn regards to cancer, cloned DNA should be of value in<br />\nbasic research. I do not foresee the use of modified DNA<br />\nas a tool for the direct treatment of cancer unless some<br />\nnew concept makes this approach possible.<br />\nQ: I understand that you have a reasonably large<br />\nfamily. Are any of your children demonstrating an<br />\ninterest in scientific reserach?<br />\nA: My wife and I have four boys and one girl. At the<br />\npresent time there does not appear to be an academic<br />\ntalent in the whole group. I suspect that they will have to<br />\nfind their niche in the business world!<br /><br />\nPAGE 10 / DECEMBER I, 1978<br />\nA<br /><br />\nO&amp;M<br /><br />\nAMik<br /><br />\nAM<br /><br />\nA measure uome vt tasy &amp; miling POOdS<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u20224 WiTh<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nDISCO:<br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 STARLINE<br /><br />\nTHE HOMEWOOD<br />\nDELICATESSEN<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022<br />\nJOHN TAYLOR<br /><br />\nJUST ABOVE 31st STREET<br />\n3105 ST.

Screenings<br />\nwill be in Shriver Hall, beginning at 7:30 p.m.<br />\nA remarkable, and still active, director, whose career<br />\nspans more than fifty years, Bunuel has always been a<br />\nrevolutionary filmmaker, assaulting bourgeois and<br />\nstorytelling conventions. Working with Salvador Dali, and<br />\nother surrealists, he made two symbol-laden films in the<br />\nlate 1920's, Un Chien Andalou and L'Age D'Or, which<br />\nexperimented with fragmented story lines. These are<br />\noutright attacks on the Catholic Church, bourgeois<br />\nsociety--on all civilized values and institutions.<br />\nThen, after directing a documentary about Spanish<br />\npoverty, Land Without Bread, he stopped making films<br />\nand spent most of the 1930's and 1940's working at<br />\nvarious studio jobs, including the preparation and<br />\nsub titling of Hollywood films for Spanish-speaking<br />\naudiences.<br />\nIt wasn't until the 1950's that Bunuel resurfaced in<br />\nMexico. His Les Olivados, a bitter depiction of how our<br />\nsociety causes juvenile delinquency, once again brought<br />\nhim worldwide attention. Since then, in what has come to<br />\nbe called his Golden Age, Bunuel has continued making<br />\nfilms in France and Spain, and with righteous consistency,<br />\nan inexorable logic of the illogical, he still wages his<br />\nsurrealist war on the world of bourgeois reason and<br />\nliberalism.<br />\nFreeely adapted from a Joseph Kessel novel, Belle du<br />\nJour (1967)is about an unhappily married woman, played<br />\nby Catherine Deneuve, whose handsome, successful and<br />\nproper surgeon husband bores her and perhaps is the<br />\ncause of her frigidity.<br />\nThinking about prostitution leads her to sign on at a<br />\nbrothel, where she only works from 2-5 (hence her<br />\nnickname and the film's title). As Bunuel makes evident,<br />\nher daytime occupation really has nothing to do with any<br />\nneed for money, but has everything to do with sexual<br />\nperversity and revenge, with how people, bored by moral<br />\nrestraints, will uphold the social facade while indulging in<br />\nbehind-the-scenes degradation. After all, a boutique is the<br />\nfront for the brothel, and the employees work in both<br />\nshopnd whorehouse.<br />\nShot in color, Belle du Jour ,and its star have a cold,<br />\ndetached beauty, which Bunuel emphasizes by stripping<br />\nthe soundtrack of any music, removing nearly all<br />\nreferences to a particular society or era, and by framing<br />\nshots not just of Deneuve's face, but of different body<br />\nparts as well, showing how she is a body in the<br />\nmarketplace of marriage An ambiguous ending invites<br />\nthe audience to speculate and moralize, while freeing the<br />\ndirector from doing the latter; indeed, the entire film is<br />\nan ambiguous series of dreams about her inner erotic life.<br />\nKessel's reality is here transferred into a dreamland, where<br />\nwhat really happens and what is merely imagined become<br />\nindistinguishable.<br />\nCatherine Deneuve also stars in Tristana (1970), the<br />\nfirst movie Bunuel made in Spain, after his magnificent<br />\nViridiana (1961). Like that earlier film, to which it is<br />\noften compared, Tristana is about a young girl (Deneuve),<br />\nward to an elderly Don (Fernando Rey), whose paternal<br />\nfeelings mix freely with those of a husband. Both father<br />\nand husband to Tristana, he dominates the girl and<br />\ninfluences her adoption of his own hedonistic lifestyle. As<br />\nin the Galdos novel from which it is taken, Bunuel's film<br />\nmercilessly points out a double standard: a man can have<br />\nboth sexual license and social position, while a woman<br />\nmust repress her sexuality; to express it would bring<br />\nabout her social downfall.<br />\nTristana flees, but then, ill, and with an amputated leg,<br />\nshe returns, a cruel, ruthless mistress. This innocent<br />\nwoman, seduced and physically marred, takes her<br />\nvengeance. As in Belle du Jour, the woman in Tristana<br />\nsuffers in a male-dominated society, unable to express her<br />\nsexuality or achieve any status other than marital; and in<br />\nsexually perverse<br />\neach film the woman avenges herself in<br />\nways.<br />\nBunuel, characteristically, offers this tale of moral<br />\nmoralizing: \"( Tristana<br />\ndegradation without himself<br />\nmy films: eroticism,<br />\nin<br />\nconcerns) the same themes as all<br />\nto showing things<br />\nmyself<br />\nlimit<br />\nand religion.

The<br />\nseries is designed to present a forum for American and<br />\ninternational new music. The Fine Arts Committee has<br />\nrecently joined the International Festival of Disappearing<br />\nArt(s), a series of performances of the old and new arts<br />\nwith participants in Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris, London,<br />\nToronto, and Baltimore. Two events are upcoming for<br />\nthis semester as part of the series: Lol Coxhill will be<br />\nperforming in the Glass Pavilion on December 6th, and<br />\nthe first Baltimore Festival of Disappearing Art(s),<br />\nfeaturing Fred Frith, CoAccident, and Mama Dada 1919<br />\nwill be held in the Listening Viewing Room on December<br />\n16th. Plans for next semester include concerts by<br />\nYochk'o Seffer and Neffesh Music from France, the Art<br />\nBears and National Health both from England, Daevid<br />\nAllen and Gong from Spain, and various national and<br />\nlocal performing artists of merit.<br />\nLol Coxhill will be making his first U.S. appearance at<br />\n8:00 p.m. on December 6th in the Glass Pavilion. Lol's<br />\nsaxophone playing is renowned in Europe as a leading<br />\nforce in the modern jazz scene. He is well known in rock<br />\ncircles as well, and his name crops up on numberous and<br />\nvaried albums by such artists as Kevin Ayers, Henry Cow,<br />\nand the Damned. Despite a ten year string of solo and<br />\ncollaborative albums he is still virtually unrecognized in<br />\nthis country except by leading American jazz musicians<br />\nand foreign music buffs. There will be both chair and rug<br />\nseating available for the concert and the audience is<br />\nadvised to bring their own refreshments.<br />\nFred Frith will be making a rare appearance in this<br />\ncountry on December 16th in the Listening-Viewing<br />\nRoom as part of the first Baltimore Festival of the<br />\nDisappearing Art(s). Frith is known as one of the most<br />\ninnovative guitarists in music today. He has played with<br />\nHenry Cow, the Art Bears, Jade Warrior, Robert Wyatt,<br />\nand Brian Eno among others. He has also recorded solo<br />\nguitar works on his own and in collaboration with Derek<br />\nBailey, Gerry Fitzgerald, and Hans Reichel. His style is<br />\nsurely one of the most interesting in all of guitar. Two<br />\nguitars having 'various electronic, harmonic and percussive<br />\ndevices are used in the creation of the alternate sounds<br />\nand music that show the expanded limits of the guitar as a<br />\ncomposer's instrument. This will be a solo performance<br />\nand it is hoped that he will return to America in the<br />\nspring to play with the Art Bears at Hopkins.<br />\nAlso (dis)appearing will be an American group called<br />\nCoAccident. Their literature describes themselves as a<br />\n\"poetry music performance group, whose works include<br />\nvoices, electronics, acoustic instruments, texts, notations,<br />\nand improvisations.\" They include the three language<br />\nengineers Kirby Malone, Chris Mason, and Marshall Reese,<br />\nAlec Bernstein on prepared piano and boxes, Mitchell<br />\nPressman on double bass, Ro Malone on visuo-design, and<br />\nwhoever else they bring on stage with them. They have<br />\nperformed in Baltimore, Washington, New York,<br />\nMassachusetts, and Toronto. CoAccident is expected to<br />\ntour California this spring and Europe this fall. Their<br />\nwork is of a somewhat revolutionary and Dadaist nature;<br />\nit is a total experience which must be seen and heard.<br />\nThe press release from the third group states,\"group be<br />\nMama Dada 1919 claim ties their yugoslavian heritage.<br />\nMama Dada 1919 has performed at hopkins this year to<br />\nperson makes language different from animal, lower, or,<br />\ncase. no one knows they. The only comment available<br />\nfrom them is 'Dada is not what dadaists think but what<br />\ndadaists.' Traditional acoustic instruments are<br />\ncomplemented by the new sonic inventions (such as the<br />\nFrench Double-Reed Horn and the Egg-Prowno Guitar),<br />\nvocals, words, non-vocal words, and various visual media<br />\nto present a piece of modern music combining structures<br />\nwith the of. They be giving more concerts in the area in<br />\nthe future well recording album release year.\"<br />\nThe Festival will begin promptly at 8:00 p.m. The<br />\naudience is requested not to eat, drink, or smoke in the<br />\nL-V Room. The Fine Arts Committee needs your support<br />\nif they are to continue with their plans for next spring.<br />\nThere will be admission charges for these two events but<br />\nthe Committee hopes to bring the prices down to a<br />\nnominal sum for future projects if these are a success.<br />\nInterested persons are urged to contact the Committee at<br />\n467-9140 or 235-2376 if they would like to help,<br />\ncomment, or find information. A splendid time is<br />\nguaranteed for all.<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nPAGE 12 1 DECEMBER 1, 1978<br /><br />\nSteve<br />\nTop<br />\nTen<br />\nHas<br />\nNew<br />\nWave<br />\nRan all's<br />\nBeing a diehard rock fan, I like having the opportunity of<br />\nlisting my Top 10 albums of the year. It's as good a way<br />\nas any of briefly summing up this year's musical highlights<br />\nas I see them. So without further ado (and if anybody<br />\nreally cares), here they are:<br />\nThe Dictators(Asylum)<br />\n1.Bloodbrothers<br />\nThe boys from da Bronx cop my top spot. Dick<br />\nManitoba may not be the handsomest man in Rock,<br />\nbut as a frontman he's in a league<br />\nlike he claims he is,<br />\nall his own. Lead guitarist Ross the Boss makes overrated<br />\nheavy metal clowns like Fred Nugent pale by comparison.<br />\nAnd Adny Shernoff is the best songwriter to have<br />\nemerged from the New York underground scene. With<br />\nwinnerslike \"Top Ten\", the `Tators will surely win their<br />\nway into youi Top Ten if you give'em a chance.<br />\nElectrifying, kick-ass r'n'r at its finest. Dictators rule,<br />\nO.K.?<br />\n2. Genration X (Chysalis)<br />\nBlonde teen idol Billy Idol has got the finest voice on<br />\nthe British p-rock circuit, and this album is chock full of<br />\ncatchy, melodic anthems that'll really get your blood<br />\npumping. Bob Andrews' manic, staccato guitar chording<br />\nhas been known to incite mass pogo attacks. 'Your<br />\nGeneration\", a certified high energy classic, is as good as<br />\ntwo Crossroads. It's hard to imagine anyone constructing<br />\na better song than \"Kiss Me Deadly\" Bundles of great<br />\nsingles on this LP. I'm working my second copy now.<br />\n3. .Darkness, on the Edge of Town Bruce Springsteen<br />\n1(Columbia)<br />\nThe Boss has returned. Originally I wasn't overly<br />\nimpressed by this album but a phenomenal (as usual)<br />\nconcert and a few more listens changed my opinion.<br />\nSpruce !- td to be the touringest star this year. While<br />\ncll known bands (and I won't mention any<br />\ncert!.<br />\nnamc play for an hour and fifteen minutes, the E Street<br />\nBand delivers three and a half hours of rock solid<br />\nentertainment. Need I tell you about the album? In the<br />\nwords of Robert Duncan, Bruce is a lover - with a giant<br />\nrock and roll dick.<br />\n4.Give Em Enough Rope. the Clash (Epic)<br />\nSecond in Popularity only to Yes in England, the Clash<br />\nroar back with a stunning followup to their much<br />\nheralded debut LP. The mix is better this time around,<br />\nand you can understand a few more words (at least 3 per<br />\nsong). Still too raw for the shake-your-booty and<br />\nle t'sge t-mell ow crowds, but rockers will loyeem.<br />\nStrummer/Jones have replaced Jagger/Richards in the<br />\neyes of theBritish youth. What is America missing out on?<br />\nA hell of a lot. Pass the word: It's Clash time!<br />\n5. This Year's Model - Elvis Costello(Columbia)<br />\nAn artist as gifted and unique as Mr. Costello conies<br />\nalong about once a decade. The 50's had Presley, in the<br />\n60's it was Dylan, and now we have this homely,<br />\nbespectacled young man who sings some of the most<br />\nseething songs ever written. \"Radio Radio\" spelled his'<br />\nfeelings out all too clearly, and FM jocks stayed away in<br />\ndroves. A few less R &amp; B throwaways and I would have<br />\nranked the album even higher. One thought: How long<br />\ncan Elvis remain angry when he's hanging out with<br />\nheartthrobs like Bebe Buell and making a million a yeaf?<br />\n6. Approved by ... The Motors(Virgin)<br />\nA real sleeper. Formed from the ashes of Ducks<br />\nDeluxe, a famed British pub rock band, the Motors, led<br />\nby Andy McMaster and Nick Garvey, hit the mark with<br />\ntheir second LP. Covering a variety of styles (including<br />\nsome Grassroots - type material!), they strive to avoid<br />\nbeing categorized as just another bunch of ugly faces. Side'<br />\n2 is extraordinary. \"Dreaming You Life Away\" and<br />\n\"Today\" are both masterpieces, intelligent and<br />\nimpeccably arranged. Two members recently split, and<br />\nthe Motors are now being reassembled. Don't count them<br />\nout.<br />\n7.Heaven Tonight - Cheap Trick (Epic)<br />\nThey may be the hottest thing going in Japan right<br />\nnow, but in the States, these Midwestern boys must still<br />\nplay the opening act routine. Rick Nielson might look like<br />\nHuntz Hall and act like a blooming idiot, but his<br />\nsongwriting ability and axemanship cannot be questioned.<br />\n\"Surrender\" and \"On the Radio\" got some limited airplay<br />\nthis summer. Lots more neat Beatlesque tunes where they<br />\ncame from too. Robin Zander is an extremely capable<br />\nlead vocalist. Fun to watch and fun to listen to, Cheap<br />\nTrick should be BIG in a few years.<br />\n8.Parallel Lines - Blondie (Chrysalis)<br />\nCommercial success also seems just around the corner.<br />\nfor Deborah Harry and crew. They've already achieved al<br />\nworldwide Number I hit with \"Denis\". The fact that.<br />\n\"Hanging on the Telephone\", their current 45, is not\u2022<br />\nbeing heard on my radio right now makes me wonder'<br />\nmore about the feasibility of the Presidential New Wave!<br /><br />\nConspiracy Theory being passed around. How could even<br />\nJimmy Carter not be touched by the chilling beauty of<br />\n\"Fade Away and Radiate?\" Quick, somebody send that<br />\nboy some Blondie albums, and include some full length<br />\nposters of Debbie!<br />\n9. The Modern Dance - Pere Ubu (Blank)<br />\nI was rendered speechless by this positively psychotic<br />\nbrand of electronic'avant garde music at Ubu's Marble Bar<br />\nappearance this past February. Atonal at times, with<br />\nAllen Ravenstine's synthesizer supplying layers of other<br />\nworldly sound effects, it may take you a few spins to<br />\nappreciate the dissonant beauty Once you \"get it\",<br />\nthough, you'll realize that this is the psychedelic album of<br />\nthe 70's, and you just may find yourself bellowing along<br />\nwith rotund vocalist Crocus Behemoth: \"Life stinks and I<br />\ncan't think/Life stinks and I need a drink. . .\" Camus<br />\nnever put it any better! Nightmares guaranteed or your<br />\nmoney back.<br />\n10.The Shirts (Capitol)<br />\nLast of the major CBGB bands to release an LP,and it's<br />\na good one. The Shirts manage to avoid the punk cliches<br />\nand arty pretensions that plague so many NY groups.<br />\nDiminutive singer Annie Golden, star of the Broadway<br />\nmusical Hair, possesses a voice about three times her size.<br />\nAll six band members sing, and the vocal arrangements<br />\nhere are superb. \"Tenth Floor Clown\" is my current<br />\nfavorite. Given better promo, conimerciality is a distinct<br />\npossibility.<br />\nOh yeah? Well I don't think too much of your Top 10<br />\neither, pal!<br /><br />\nThough you'd never know it by listening to the radio,<br />\n1978 has been a great year for high quality albums. Due to<br />\nthe enormous number of records released every week,<br />\nthough, it seems you either have to be a millionaire, a<br />\nrecord store employee, a critic, or an accomplished<br />\nshoplifter to get a chance to hear most of them.<br />\nIf you've never heard most of the aforementioned<br />\nalbums, don't worry,'cause you're not alone. FM playlists<br />\nare getting tighter and tighter, making it . -gher and<br />\ntougher for new artists to get any kind of exposure at all.<br />\nDemographics, program directors will point out, show<br />\nthat the general public has no interest in new wave music<br />\nat all. That's not too surprising, considering the fact that<br />\nthe public never hears any. Given the choice between<br />\nBlondie's latest, which you may have read a good review<br />\nof in the City Paper, and Foreigner's latest, which<br />\nsounded pretty good to you on the radio, what are you<br /><br />\ntin<br />\ntiommo<br />\nPim P\u201e (I)<br /><br />\nB<br />\nv<br /><br />\nC:4\"<br /><br />\nby<br />\nRos Resnick<br />\nThe 1978 movie season seems to be ending in a flurry<br />\nof excitement. Animated excitement,that is. Waters/zip<br />\nDown and Lord of the Rings, cartoon versions of their<br />\nrespective novels, do for animation what Star Wars, and<br />\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind did for special<br />\neffects.<br />\nWatership Down, the epic fable of a community of<br />\n' rabbits struggling for survival against a hostile world of<br />\n. ecologically irresponsible humans and a band of<br />\n' totalitarian rabbits, features two types of animation, both<br />\n, reflecting the kind of action portrayed. The introductory<br />\nand concluding segments are myth, a comfortable frame<br />\nto hold the more realistic, main part of .the movie. These<br />\nmythological segments are rendered in child-like<br />\nanimation, with geometric shapes, heavy black lines, and<br />\ncrayon-colors. This is effective in evoking a sense of<br />\nprimitive art and also in sketching a creation myth the<br />\nway children would perceive it. The second type of<br />\nanimation, that of the actual story, is realistic and<br />\ndetailed. The rabbits are not of the Walt Disney variety<br />\n(humanized caricatures that we agree to call bunnies).<br />\nThese little critters are accuarately rendered right down to<br />\nie individual hairs on their noses; it is hard to avoid<br /><br />\ngoing to spend your five bucks on?<br />\nAnd just what is a \"new wave\" group anyway? The<br />\ngenre is so broad, the tag is ultimately meaningless. What<br />\ndoes Pere Ubu have in common with Generation X? What<br />\ndo the Shirts have in common with the Clash? Nothing<br />\nexcept for inspiration and the fact that they don't sell<br />\nmany records in the USA. Tom \"Technoflash\"Scholz sells<br />\nmore of his albums in an hour than these groups do in a<br />\nmonth. Rod Stewart probably spent more money last<br />\nnight than Pere Ubu made this year-.<br />\nIt's really unfortunate that the average rock fan thinks<br />\n\"new wave\" means creeps in black leather jackets, ripped<br />\nt-shirts, safety pins through noses, extreme acts of<br />\nviolence, and a general absence of musical ability. That<br />\nwas mainly London, about a year and a half ago. Now,all<br />\nthe posing seems to have slackened off appreciably (even<br />\ngobbing- spitting on band members - is going out of<br />\nstyle!), and the scene is moving on. Or at least trying to.<br />\nThe negative image of the prototypical \"punk rocker,\"<br />\nhowever, fostered by sensationalism in the masss media,<br />\nTV shows such C.P.O. Sharkey, Sugar Time,and WK RP in<br />\nCincinnati which featured ridiculous punk rock episodes,<br />\nand most of all, a frail junkie named Sid Vicious, has gone<br />\na long way to assure that any band even remotely<br />\nconnected with the new wave won't get a fair shake in<br />\nthis country. The powers that be in the multibillion dollar<br />\nmusic industry don't want anything to do with \"that<br />\npunk rock crap\"-let the critics be damned!<br />\nWhile I'll be the first to admit that there are an<br />\nabundance of third rate new wave bands today churning<br />\nout unlistenable garbage, I can't help but feel that by<br />\nignoring the new wave altogether, America is missing out<br />\non the most exciting genre in contemporary music. There<br />\nis real rock and roll being made out there, if only people<br />\nwould turn down their Grease albums long enough to hear<br /><br />\nif.<br />\nLet's hope WJHU-FM's programming will be as good as<br />\nthat of WGTB-FM, Georgetown University's station. If<br />\nstation in Baltimore,<br />\nwe've ever needed a progressive<br />\nwe surely need it now. The new music should be getting<br />\nsome airplay-it's that simple.<br />\nI mean, how can we all he Devo when three quarters of<br />\n\u2022<br />\nus have never heard Devo?<br />\nSteve Randall, a Junior majoring in Psychology, plays bass<br />\nfor Ivan ,and the Executioners, a mysterious p-k r--k band<br />\nwho, according to Steve, \"have never given a bad<br />\nshow.\"<br />\nwincing during the violent scenes when rabbit guts are<br />\nbeing spilled. The background scenery, the rabbits' fields<br />\n(warrens) and underground passages are beautifully done.<br />\nThe muted, ethereal grays and greens also add to the<br />\nrealism. Yet the animators occasionally return to. solid<br />\nstreaks of color to lend emotional impact to a scene. For<br />\ninstance, when one of the rabbits forsees the warren's<br />\ndoom in a field covered with blood and uprooted trees.<br />\nThe Lord of the Rings takes animation technology one<br />\nstep further with its technique of overlaying photography<br />\nwith animator's paint. Like Waters/zip Down, Lord of the<br />\nRings also employs two types of animation. The first is<br />\nthe conventional lines-and-colors kind, used to portray<br />\nthe heroes, the members of the Fellowship of the Ring.<br />\nGandalf, the wizard, looks especially awesome in his<br />\nsweeping, white robes and body-length beard;some of the<br />\nh obbits' fleeting facial expressions are marvelously,<br />\nsometimes oddly rendered by this medium but the second<br />\nkind of animation, the photographic hocus pocus, is the<br />\nmore extrapordinary. The villainous Orcs and Nazgul<br />\n(Ringwraiths) look enough like men to be played by<br />\ngrotesquely masked actors on real horses. In battle scenes<br />\npainted over with green and gray washes, these insidious<br />\nraiders with pea-green, rubber faces withmarachino cherry<br />\neyes, look like a cross between medieval knights and<br />\nregulars at the bar in Star Wars. The customers at the inn<br />\nwhere Frodo and Company spend the night are also<br />\ndrawn in this manner. These almost-photographic<br />\ndrawings startle the viewer; it's as though the Mona Lisa<br />\nhad changed the position of her lips. This overlayed<br />\nphotography is also used to good effect during the scenes<br />\nof wizardry; the flashes of color and light are the most<br />\nsensational effects since Fantasia. Finally, the painted<br />\nbackdrops of river valleys and fortresses project the<br />\nforceful natural beauty found in the Middle Earth<br />\ncalendars.<br />\n, Both Waters/zip Down and the Lord of the Rings stand<br />\nindependently as exquisite artistic creations, apart from<br />\ntheir merits of translating print into film. These movies<br />\nshould be viewed with a mind open to acceptance of the<br />\nbeauty of animation.<br /><br />\npaid advertisement<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER 1 PAGE 13<br /><br />\n'MORE COURSE REVIEWS<br />\nBelow are descriptions of several courses being offered for next semester.<br />\nUnfortuna'ely, these professers' statements were received after The Course Guide had<br />\ngone to press, so as a public service we are running them here in the News-Letter. If<br />\nthese courses sound like ones you want to take but you have already pre-registered,<br />\nflon't despair. You can add them next semester after registration.<br /><br />\nAnthropology<br />\nDr. Ahern<br />\n7.20 Intro to Social and Cultural Anthropology<br />\nThis course is an(xamination of central concepts and issues in social anthropology.<br />\nWe will begin by studying aspects of two societies in detail: the Trobriands of<br />\nMelanesia and traditional and modern China. The ethnographic data from these two<br />\ncase studies will then be brought to bear on a series of problems: how can phenomena<br />\nlike the incest taboo or initiation ceremonies be explained cross-culturally? How do<br />\napproaches based on evolutionary development, cultural ecology, structuralism,<br />\nfunctionalism, or symbolic analysis contribute to the explanation of human behavior?<br />\nWe will end by talking about the practice of anthropology in North America today.<br />\nTexts will include Wolf, The House of Lim, Malinowski, Argonauts of the Western<br />\nPacific, Levi-Strauss, Totemism, and a selection of reprints.<br />\nGrades will be based on essay examinations and short(5-page) papers.<br />\nDr. Ahern<br />\n7.648 Theory in Anthropology<br />\nA discussion of recent issues in theoretical anthropology, focused around three<br />\nmajor themes: 1) the problem of what kinds of explanations for human actions are<br />\nappropriate for anthropology, those used in the natural sciences, those used in<br />\ninterpietive disciplines, or some other; 2) what theories of meaning in language are<br />\nassumed implicitly or explicitly by various ethnographers; how do these different<br />\ntheories affect analysis; 3) what is the nature of conventional rules in society; distinct<br />\ntypes of rules; vagueness in rules; following rules in society. The first half of the course<br />\nwill involve readings in both theory and ethnography; the second half will be devoted<br />\nto the reanalysis of ethnographic accounts on the basis of the theoretical discussions<br />\nundertaken in the first half.<br /><br />\nHistory of Art<br />\n1.342 The Renaissance Without Madonnas<br /><br />\nDr. Verheyen<br /><br />\nThis course, which has never been given before, will deal with works of the<br />\nItalian and Northern Renaissance with an emphasis on non-religious art. Discussion<br />\nwill center on the question of the survival of pagan concepts and imagery during the<br />\nMiddle Ages and their rediscovery during the 15th and 16th centuries. The works<br />\ndiscussed will range from the decoration of marriage chests to Titiar.'s mythological<br />\npaintings done for Philip II of Spain.<br />\nReadings will include art historical texts and (to a greater extent) works of literature<br />\nfrom Ovid to Ariosto. Reading assignments will be about 100 pages per week (all in<br />\nEnglish). Two short papers will be required. No previous art history course is required<br />\nas prerequisite.<br />\nDr. Stanton<br />\n1.386 Modern Sculpture<br />\nModern Sculpture will follow the development of subject and technique in sculpture<br />\nfrom Rodin to the present. The course will require some reading but the emphasis will<br />\nbe placed on study of works of sculpture in the Hershhem and other museums within<br />\neasy reach.<br /><br />\nHistory of Science<br />\nDr. Haraway<br />\n14.373 Biology and Politics<br />\nThe course will focus on varieties of biological determinism in political debate,<br />\nespecially in debates about reproduction, the family, sexual roles, and human nature.<br />\nThe first third of the course is called \"Political Physiology: The Body as Technological<br />\nDevice.\" Using James Tiptree's science fiction (Star Songs of an Old Primate), and<br />\ncurrent popular health and self-improvment manuals(Man's Body: An Owner's Manual<br />\nand Woman's Body: An Owner's Manual) we will discuss history of<br />\n20th<br />\ncentury physiology and in e.dicine which help define our sense of our<br />\nplace in nature. The main themes will be ideologies of stress and<br />\nof stress and sexual<br />\nenergy.<br />\nThe second third of the course is called \"Birth Control, Feminism and the Family:<br />\nForces and Relations of Reproduction.\"We will explore alternative ways of<br />\napproaching the social and medical and political history of the birth control movement<br />\nin America in the 19th and 20th centuries. The book will be Woman's Body, Woman's<br />\nRight supplemented by Capitalism and the Family. We will also make use of From<br />\nPrivate Vice to Public Virtue, but the text is not yet in paperback.<br />\nThe last third of the course is called \"Evolutionary Theory and Population Biology:<br />\nThe Produce of History Is Human Nature.\" We will look at the debate on the relation<br />\nbetween population and resources in the 19th century (Malthus'Essay on the Principle<br />\nof Population, Norton Critical Edition). We will then consider eugenics (as biological<br />\ntheory and as political movement in America) and post-World War II population<br />\ncontrol movements. We will conclude with an exploration of sociobiology in the<br />\ndebate on the human being's place in nature and history. We will use Biology as a<br />\nSocial Weapon and selections from E.O. Wilson.<br />\n! Format will include both lecture and discussion. Students will be asked to complete<br />\ncourse reaf'ings in time for the discussions, write short papers based on the reading, and<br />\ntake an active part in determining the analysis and direction of the course. Books cost<br />\nIabout $10, but will also be available on reserve.<br /><br />\nNon-Departmental<br />\n70.382 Changing China<br />\nDr. Pfeifer<br />\nThis is the final course that I'll teach at Hopkins, after ten years here. If you<br />\ncannot from it learn \"the truth,\" you will learn how differently \"the truth\" can look.<br />\nThe course focuses on understanding domestic developments in China since 1949. It<br />\nbegins with a three-week introduction to the Chinese revolution. The bulk of the<br />\ncourse then deals with Maoist revolution between 1949 and Mao's death in 1976.<br />\n\"Changing China\" concludes with several weeks devoted to examining the post-Mao era<br />\nto determine whether the revolution is over. Comparisons with the United States<br />\nnecessarily are involved throughout.<br />\nAs in all my courses, I teach the particular materials of this one with several ulterior<br />\neducational motives. First, I hope to encourage students to develop two crucial skills,<br />\nwhich are an important part of what it means to be \"educated:\" the capacity to read<br />\ndifferent materials critically, and the capacity to write a clear, disciplined argument. I<br />\ndo this through .the seminar format, in which the basic arguments, assumptions an:1<br />\nunasked questions of the reading are drawn out, and through the assigning of and my<br />\ncommentaries upon short, argumentative papers. These pairers and my comments<br />\nconcerning both substantive points and argument structure are then discussed<br />\nindividually with students. Second, I try to communicate to students that there are<br />\nvisions of the world other than the liberal-caiiitalist one, with which we have all been<br />\nthoroughly indoctrinated, and that these other visions may tell us vital things about<br />\nour world and ourselves. Third, I encourage students to work together to further their<br />\nunderstanding. My overall aim in teaching is to contribute to stur.!ents' capacity to<br />\nthink for themselves and to understand the world as it exists.<br />\nThe readings, most of which are listel below, average about 200 pages per week.<br />\nTwo four-page papers and a final ten-page paper are assigned. In addi-ion to the<br />\nreadings, the papers, and class discussion, we will play a simulation game called Star<br />\nPower; I will present a slide show on art and politics; and one or more movies will be<br />\nshown. For writing papers, students will be organized into small discussion groups so<br />\nthey can benefit from each other's ideas and arguments as they work out, organize and<br />\ncompose their own. No exams. No prerequisites.<br />\nBooks to be read in whele or part: William Hinton, Fanshen; John G.

Some<br />\nattention will be given at the outset to the nature of moral problems and judgements,<br />\n'to skeptical challenges to rational argument in ethics, and to the similarities and<br />\ndifferences among moral, scientific, and medical judgments and the place or rationality<br />\nin each. Next, the moral and social dimensions of the physician-patient relation will be<br />\nexplored. Emphasis will be placed on the notion of personal care, and the implications<br />\nand possible qualifications of the notion will be considered in subsequent discussion of<br />\na select number of moral problems. Among these will be: placebo therapy,<br />\nexperimentation on human subjects, appropriate responses to refusal of life-saving<br />\ntreatment for religious reasons, persons choosing to die, and the treatment of defective<br />\nnewborn infants.<br />\nThe class will have a lecture-discussion format with assistant-led discussion sections.<br />\nFilms and outside speakers will be used to stimulate discussion.
