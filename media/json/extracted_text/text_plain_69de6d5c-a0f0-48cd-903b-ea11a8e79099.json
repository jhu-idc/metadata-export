What a buzz there was, what a<br />\nbrouhaha in faculty common rooms, what a rattling of teacups,<br />\nWhen. Dr. Agnes Thudd Sigafoos, first president of Gransmire,<br />\nlifted her learned old head and announced defiantly, \"We will<br />\nteach the student, not the course. There will be no marks, no<br />\nexams, no requirements. This, by George, is Progressive<br />\nEducation!\"<br />\nWell sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country cast<br />\noff their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire to enroll<br />\nat Gransmire. Here they found freedom. They broadened their<br />\nvistas. They lengthened their horizons. They unstopped their<br />\nbottled personalities. They roamed the campus in togas, leading ocelots on leashes.<br />\nAnd, of course, they smoked Marlboro cigarettes. (I say,\"Of<br />\ncourse.\" Why do I say,\"Of curse\"? I say;\"Of course\" because<br />\nit is a matter of course that anyone in search of freedom should<br />\n-naturally turn to Marlboro,for Marlboro is the smoke that sets<br />\nthe spirit soaring, that unyokes the captive soul, that fills the<br />\nair with the murmur of wings.

What a buzz there was, what a<br />\nbrouhaha in faculty common rooms, what a rattling of teacups,<br />\nWhen. Dr. Agnes Thudd Sigafoos, first president of Gransmire,<br />\nlifted her learned old head and announced defiantly, \"We will<br />\nteach the student, not the course. There will be no marks, no<br />\nexams, no requirements. This, by George, is Progressive<br />\nEducation!\"<br />\nWell sir, forward-looking maidens all over the country cast<br />\noff their fetters and came rushing to New Hampshire to enroll<br />\nat Gransmire. Here they found freedom. They broadened their<br />\nvistas. They lengthened their horizons. They unstopped their<br />\nbottled personalities. They roamed the campus in togas, leading ocelots on leashes.<br />\nAnd, of course, they smoked Marlboro cigarettes. (I say,\"Of<br />\ncourse.\" Why do I say,\"Of curse\"? I say;\"Of course\" because<br />\nit is a matter of course that anyone in search of freedom should<br />\n-naturally turn to Marlboro,for Marlboro is the smoke that sets<br />\nthe spirit soaring, that unyokes the captive soul, that fills the<br />\nair with the murmur of wings. If you think flavor went out<br />\nWhen filters came in\u2014try Marlboro. They are sold in soft pack<br />\nor flip-top box wherever freedom rings.)<br />\nBut all was not Marlboro and ocelots for the girls of Grans/tire. There was work and study too\u2014not in the ordinary sense,<br />\nto be sure, for there were no formal classes. Instead there was<br />\na broad approach to enlarging each girl's potentials, both mental<br />\nand physical.<br />\nTake, for example, the course called B.M.S. (Basic Motor<br />\nSkills). B.M.S. was divided into L.D. (Lying Down), S.U.<br />\n(Standing Up) and W.(Walking). Once the student had mastered L.D. and S.U.,she was taught to W.\u2014but not just to W.<br />\nany old way! No, sir! She was taught to W. with poise,<br />\ndignity, bearing! To inculcate a sense of balance in the girl,<br />\nshe began her exercises by walking with a suitcase in each hand.<br />\n(One girl, Mary Ellen Dorgenicht, got so good at it that today<br />\nShe is bell captain at the Deshler-Hilton Hotel in Columbus,<br />\nOhio.)

Again no formality was imposed. They were<br />\nsimply told to fling themselves about in any way their impulses<br />\ndictated, and, believe you me,it was quite an impressive sight<br />\nto see them go bounding into the woods with their togas flying.<br />\n(Several later joined the U.S. Forestry Service.)<br />\nThere was also a lot of finger painting and sculpture with<br />\nCoat hangers and like that, and soon the fresh wind of Progre,saivism came whistling out of Gransmire to blow the ancient dust<br />\nOf pedantry off curricula everywhere, and today, thanks to the<br />\nPioneers at Gransmire, we are all free.<br />\nIf you are ever in New Hampshire, be sure to visit the Grans1900 Mai kilaulinra<br />\nretire campus.
