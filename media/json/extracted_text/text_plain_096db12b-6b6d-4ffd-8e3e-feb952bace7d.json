Could it possibly be that these<br />\nstudents viewed one semester less at this<br />\nschool as a desirable goal? If we have<br />\n\"grabbed\" credits as he elegantly<br />\nsuggests, is it perhaps because the outside<br />\nworld held more allure than the Hop?<br />\nAnother point: Dean Suskind is not<br />\nmaking it harder to attain part-time<br />\nstatus; he has made it impossible (at least<br />\nfor me). He is particularly concerned with<br />\nthe students' attitudes towards achieving<br />\nonly the minimum requirements; one<br />\nwould wish the professors would fulfill<br />\nrequirements such as teaching. Would<br />\nthey crush under the weight of, say, two<br />\ncourses per semester?<br />\nThe school does have the perogative of<br />\naVe.a. tvas,<br />\nCeek<br />\n\\i\u2018iLWA,Ainst..\u2018vt,NNAt%<br />\nHopkins seems<br />\n<br />\nto limit<br />\n<br />\nthe students'<br />\n<br />\nfreedom, one of Hopkins' more<br />\npraiseworthy attitudes, it should<br />\nreconsider.

It strikes me<br />\nas odd that the school should be<br />\nbewailing the loss of students without<br />\nasking why the depletion of the ranks is<br />\noccurring.

In years past this<br />\ndecision was made by the Student<br />\nupon the<br />\nCouncil, acting<br />\nrecommendation of a selection<br />\ncommittee appointed by the Student<br />\nCouncil. The selection committee consists<br />\nC\u2018Ne. SAwA.ex\u2018t<br />\npeople on this year's committee.<br />\n<br />\nfor its vote of approval. Once these<br />\napplications have been approved, the<br />\nStudent Council should then conduct a<br />\nrelay poll of the undergraduate student<br />\nbody in regard to its preference of the<br />\nsymposium topic ' -from among the<br />\nselections. This poll should be the major<br />\ndeterminant in the decision.<br />\nAfter much debate the proposal was<br />\nvoted down for this hear's selection<br />\nprocedure. Although there were several<br />\nfavorable comments for implementing<br />\nchanges involving greater student input in<br />\nthe selection of the symposium topic, the<br />\ndecision about the procedure for next<br />\nyear was left hanging.<br />\nIn general we were disappointedat the<br />\nreaction the proposal received by the<br />\nStudent Council. The Council was<br />\nextremely defensive at the suggestion that<br />\nthe current selection procedure was not<br />\nrepresentative. Further, several<br />\nquestioned whether students could make<br />\na valid choice of the topics presented.<br />\nMost representatives failed to focus on<br />\n\u2022\u2022 \u20224<br />\nIT1<br />\nthe a or issue.<br />\n<br />\nIn light of the large sums of money and<br />\nthe publicity that accompanies the<br />\nSymposium, several campus groups feel<br />\nthat this decision should instead be<br />\ngoverned by the preference of the student<br />\nbody. Therefore, we suggested the<br />\nfollowing propsal to the Student Council:<br />\nAs a revision in the present<br />\nrecommendation procedure of the MSE<br />\nSymposium selection committee to the<br />\nStudent Council, we propose that the<br />\ncommittee select at least three choices<br />\nfrom the total set of applications, which<br />\nthey then forward to the Student Council<br />\n<br />\nthe topic and the chairperson should be<br />\n<br />\nprimarily determined by the students.<br />\nInstead, the Council perpetually threw up<br />\nminor details concerning implementation<br />\nwhich we felt could easily be worked out<br />\nlater if the Student Council voted in favor<br />\nof greater undergraduate representation.<br />\nWe plan to continue to press this issue by<br />\ninstituting the relay poll mentioned above<br />\nand submitting the results to the Student<br />\nCouncil and administrators.<br />\nMack Lee\u2014MaryPIRG<br />\nKathy Klemmer\u2014Student Ass.<br />\nPeggy Arps\u2014Women's Center<br />\n<br />\nSome inside dope about the plays<br />\nBy ALAN FEIN<br />\nThis past week the Barnstormers<br />\npresented two plays, Under Milkwood by<br />\nDylan Thomas and What the Butler Saw<br />\nby Joe Orton.

People don't mind if<br />\nyour Christmas card arrives after New<br />\nYear's, but a valentine on the fifteenth is<br />\nno good at all. If you're not nervous<br />\nenough to mail the card two or three days<br />\ntoo early, you must be bored with the<br />\n<br />\naddressee; you're definitely not<br />\ninfatuated. Receiving a valentine on the<br />\nthirteenth is very impressive.<br />\nFifteen years ago it wasn't so<br />\ncomplicated because we didn't worry.<br />\nMiss Elliot (first grade) and Mrs.<br />\nStephenson (second grade) made the day<br />\nas mindless as they possibly could, telling<br />\nus to use those blunt-edged scissors until<br />\nwe had enough heart shapes for everyone,<br />\nfriend or eilemy. Alliances were always<br />\nchanging, and the fact that Candy handed<br />\nme a card which said \"I love you\" didn't<br />\nmean she would choose me for her<br />\nkickball team.<br />\n(Of course, I didn't care about that<br />\nbecause I had an eye for Mary, an<br />\neight-year-old charmer who wooed me<br />\nwith drawings of sea monsters.)<br />\n\"With love\"<br />\nMaybe we understood relationships<br />\nbetter when we were children, because<br />\nnow we worry.

During the<br />\nLupercalia, the Romans tried to prevent<br />\ndisappointments by having the young<br />\npeople draw names out of a love urn.<br />\nBut I rather take my chances than<br />\nstand in line for something which<br />\ncouldn't be special. If I get a note from<br />\nJennifer, it will make up for all the<br />\nproblems of two years ago. I prefer to<br />\ntake outrageous chances.<br />\nIt's almost time to check the mail.<br />\n<br />\nwhich of the actors moves like some<br />\nmixture of Chaplin and Frankenstein,<br />\naccording to the director, or which one I<br />\nthink moves like a Mack truck. I also<br />\nwouldn't tell you which member of the<br />\ncast is only suited to play heavies, not<br />\nsuch light stuff. And then I wouldn't give<br />\naway the bizarre, surprise ending. So the<br />\nwhole point is that you should go see the<br />\nshow to find out all that stuff.<br />\nNow the play does have its problems.<br />\nIt's funny but it's not fun. You forget the<br />\nlines you laugh at, and though you might<br />\nnot stop laughing during the second act,<br />\nyou stop during the curtain call. Orton<br />\nhas written a lot of funny lines. Funny<br />\nlines, however, don't necessarily develop<br />\ncharacters, and then, of course, certain<br />\nactors just can't develop characters. Now<br />\nI'm not going to mention any names<br />\n('cause I've still got to face these people),<br />\nexcept for Alan Fink. He's great. I only<br />\nwish he was on stage more often, because<br />\nwhen he is on, the play really moves. He's<br />\ngot a real comic sense about him and he<br />\nknows how to use it on stage. The rest of<br />\nthe cast doesn't hurt the play so much.<br />\nThey just don't help it. It's not that<br />\n<br />\nthey're nondescript (Mack trucks really<br />\naren't nondescript). I'd just rather not<br />\nhave to describe them.<br />\nSomething about the play to entice<br />\nyou to come: Orton has written an<br />\nextremely comical satire on institutional<br />\npsychiatry and psychoanalysis in general.<br />\nThe plot is very complex with numerous<br />\ntwists and ironies. In the style of English<br />\ndrawing-room comedies, there are<br />\nmistaken identities, curtain scenes, and<br />\nMUCH DISROBING. The bizarre,<br />\nsurprise ending concludes the satire and,<br />\nin a sense shifts the attack of the satire<br />\nfrom psychiatry to the form of the play<br />\nitself. The play becomes a spoof on itself<br />\nand the genre of the drawing-room<br />\ncomedies, by satirizing its subject to the<br />\npoint of farce.<br />\nOn behalf of the actors it must be said<br />\nthat with one or two exceptions, Orton<br />\nreally hasn't developed characters so<br />\nmuch as humorous situations. The play<br />\nmakes for great reading, but it is difficult<br />\nto play.<br />\nThe director, Lee Dorsey, did a fairly<br />\ngood job of staging the numerous<br />\nentrances and exits, but he too had some<br />\nproblems. I can't understand, for<br />\ninstance, why he had Don Goldstein yell<br />\nin a monotone through all of his speeches<br />\n(in terms of inside dope, however, that<br />\nproblem is a directorial problem and not<br />\nDon's).<br />\nNow, after all that I think I have left<br />\nmyself room to recommend it. The play<br />\nis genuinely funny and it really has some<br />\nsuperb moments. It's definitely worth the<br />\nmoney. My only complaint was that it<br />\nisn't as good as it could have been.<br />\nUnder Milkwood: Whatever you do,<br />\nthough, go see it. The show is the best<br />\nthing to be presented on a Hopkins stage<br />\nin two years. The play traces the events<br />\nand characters of the town of Llaregubb<br />\nfrom midnight one day to midnight the<br />\nnext. Each actor plays a few characters.<br />\nGarath Esersky, a Goucher senior, has<br />\ndone an amazing job of direction,<br />\ncombinging an informal atmosphere with<br />\na highly polished dramatic presentation.<br />\nThe whole cast gives an excellent<br />\nperformance. Three, however, stand out<br />\nfrom the rest. Sally Fuller is extremely<br />\nexciting, Diane Reese absolutely exquisite<br />\n(the real star of the show),and John Kidd<br />\nis some equally superlative adjective.<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 6/news-letter/february 13, 1973<br />\n<br />\n'Adjunct Professorship' announced by Owen<br />\n<br />\nCOUrSeS<br />\n<br />\nan assistant professor of medical<br />\nintellectual community in our<br />\nBy PETER GARDNER<br />\npsychology and pediatrics at the<br />\nThe creation of a new type of area.\"<br />\nMedical<br />\nSchool.<br />\nappointments<br />\nfirst<br />\ntwo<br />\nThe<br />\nbe<br />\nteaching appointment to<br />\nAs<br />\nadjunct<br />\nprofessor at the<br />\nare.<br />\nprogram<br />\nthe<br />\nnew<br />\nunder<br />\nwas<br />\nprofessor<br />\nadjunct<br />\nas<br />\nknown<br />\nUniversity, she is teaching a<br />\nMarjorie Harley, a psychologist<br />\nannounced recently by Dr.<br />\npsychology course entitled<br />\nspecializing in child and adult<br />\nGeorge Owen, Dean of the<br />\n\"Metapsychological<br />\nAspects of<br />\nof<br />\ntwo<br />\nthe<br />\nholder<br />\nanalysis and<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nPsychoanalytic<br />\nTheory.\"<br />\nThe<br />\nprofessorships<br />\nat<br />\nthe<br />\nassistant<br />\na<br />\nwill<br />\nbe<br />\nThe new position<br />\ncourse is described as a survey of<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of<br />\npart-time appointment offered<br />\npsychoanalytic theory Presented<br />\nMedicine, and the Reverend<br />\nfor one year to oustanding<br />\nwithin<br />\nthe framework of<br />\nFrancis X.

Perhaps the most pressing consideration<br />\nflaking the dry skin off our scalps is this: why doesn't<br />\nit snow in Baltimore anymore?<br />\nWe posed the question to men and women on the<br />\nstreet with, alas, better minds than yours and ours.<br />\nThe.y responded. Our security watchman, eying two<br />\ndozen empty beer cans, replied, \"We're hoping it doesn't, but it probably .will.\" That sobering observation,<br />\ncoupled with a blistering wind chill factor shooting<br />\nthrough the door, froze our belligerent minds.

Could it possibly be that these<br />\nstudents viewed one semester less at this<br />\nschool as a desirable goal? If we have<br />\n\"grabbed\" credits as he elegantly<br />\nsuggests, is it perhaps because the outside<br />\nworld held more allure than the Hop?<br />\nAnother point: Dean Suskind is not<br />\nmaking it harder to attain part-time<br />\nstatus; he has made it impossible (at least<br />\nfor me). He is particularly concerned with<br />\nthe students' attitudes towards achieving<br />\nonly the minimum requirements; one<br />\nwould wish the professors would fulfill<br />\nrequirements such as teaching. Would<br />\nthey crush under the weight of, say, two<br />\ncourses per semester?<br />\nThe school does have the perogative of<br />\naVe.a. tvas,<br />\nCeek<br />\n\\i\u2018iLWA,Ainst..\u2018vt,NNAt%<br />\nHopkins seems<br /><br />\nto limit<br /><br />\nthe students'<br /><br />\nfreedom, one of Hopkins' more<br />\npraiseworthy attitudes, it should<br />\nreconsider.

It strikes me<br />\nas odd that the school should be<br />\nbewailing the loss of students without<br />\nasking why the depletion of the ranks is<br />\noccurring. With the cart firmly in front of<br />\nthe horse, I now gather that we, the<br />\nstudents, are here for them, the faculty<br />\nand the administration. I guess I always<br />\nhad it backwards.<br /><br />\nminimester, summer and night school,<br />\nand junior year abroad can serve only to<br />\ndecrease student interest in going to JHU,<br />\nfor these arrangements can be found at<br />\nother universities all over the<br />\ncountry\u2014and that,- in administrative<br />\nterms, is a loss of 10,800 bucks a kid.<br />\nMartha Podren<br />\nClass of'75<br /><br />\nMSE Symposium<br />\nTo the Editors:<br />\nThe MSE Symposium is an event run<br />\nby Hopkins undergraduates for the entire<br />\nstudent body, and it seems only<br />\nreasonable that the undergraduate<br />\nstudent body have a voice in the decision<br />\nof the symposium topic. In years past this<br />\ndecision was made by the Student<br />\nupon the<br />\nCouncil, acting<br />\nrecommendation of a selection<br />\ncommittee appointed by the Student<br />\nCouncil. The selection committee consists<br />\nC\u2018Ne. SAwA.ex\u2018t<br />\npeople on this year's committee.<br /><br />\nfor its vote of approval. Once these<br />\napplications have been approved, the<br />\nStudent Council should then conduct a<br />\nrelay poll of the undergraduate student<br />\nbody in regard to its preference of the<br />\nsymposium topic ' -from among the<br />\nselections. This poll should be the major<br />\ndeterminant in the decision.<br />\nAfter much debate the proposal was<br />\nvoted down for this hear's selection<br />\nprocedure. Although there were several<br />\nfavorable comments for implementing<br />\nchanges involving greater student input in<br />\nthe selection of the symposium topic, the<br />\ndecision about the procedure for next<br />\nyear was left hanging.<br />\nIn general we were disappointedat the<br />\nreaction the proposal received by the<br />\nStudent Council. The Council was<br />\nextremely defensive at the suggestion that<br />\nthe current selection procedure was not<br />\nrepresentative. Further, several<br />\nquestioned whether students could make<br />\na valid choice of the topics presented.<br />\nMost representatives failed to focus on<br />\n\u2022\u2022 \u20224<br />\nIT1<br />\nthe a or issue.<br /><br />\nIn light of the large sums of money and<br />\nthe publicity that accompanies the<br />\nSymposium, several campus groups feel<br />\nthat this decision should instead be<br />\ngoverned by the preference of the student<br />\nbody. Therefore, we suggested the<br />\nfollowing propsal to the Student Council:<br />\nAs a revision in the present<br />\nrecommendation procedure of the MSE<br />\nSymposium selection committee to the<br />\nStudent Council, we propose that the<br />\ncommittee select at least three choices<br />\nfrom the total set of applications, which<br />\nthey then forward to the Student Council<br /><br />\nthe topic and the chairperson should be<br /><br />\nprimarily determined by the students.<br />\nInstead, the Council perpetually threw up<br />\nminor details concerning implementation<br />\nwhich we felt could easily be worked out<br />\nlater if the Student Council voted in favor<br />\nof greater undergraduate representation.<br />\nWe plan to continue to press this issue by<br />\ninstituting the relay poll mentioned above<br />\nand submitting the results to the Student<br />\nCouncil and administrators.<br />\nMack Lee\u2014MaryPIRG<br />\nKathy Klemmer\u2014Student Ass.<br />\nPeggy Arps\u2014Women's Center<br /><br />\nSome inside dope about the plays<br />\nBy ALAN FEIN<br />\nThis past week the Barnstormers<br />\npresented two plays, Under Milkwood by<br />\nDylan Thomas and What the Butler Saw<br />\nby Joe Orton. Under Milkwood will be<br />\npresented again Thursday night at<br />\nGoucher, 8 PM in Van Meter 200. What<br />\nthe Butler Saw continues this Friday and<br />\nSaturday nights in Shriver Hall at 8:30.<br />\nSince I'm the Vice-President of the<br />\nBarnstormers I'm supposed to have some<br />\ninside dope y'all can toke on. At least<br />\nthat's why they asked me to write this<br />\nreview. That and the fact that I can spell<br />\ngood, unlike their own writers. Also they<br />\nknew I was going to the show, while they<br />\ncouldn't be so sure of themselves.<br />\nOf course, the whole set-up raised<br />\nproblems for me. If I didn't like the<br />\nproductions, I had to find some way of<br />\ndiplomatically presenting their problems,<br />\nwhile still leaving myself room to<br />\nrecommend them.<br />\nThe first play<br />\nConcerning What .the Butler Saw:<br />\nc.0<br />\nvvnen . le snow goes on next<br />\nweekend, the stage crew is planning to<br /><br />\nsubstitute something for the candy pills<br />\nMarc Lione swallows in Act Two. I also<br />\ncan't tell you that the stage crew plan: to<br />\npre-cut flowers which are supposed to be<br />\ncut on stage. In addition I can't tell you<br />\nthat the point of greatest discussion<br />\nbetween the director and the producer<br />\nwas what music to play during<br />\nintermission. And then there's the fact<br />\nthat the set, complete with twelve foot<br />\nflats, a twelve foot bookcase, and French<br />\ndoors, was built almost entirely by three<br />\npeople, despite what the program says.<br />\nThen, of course, I wouldn't tell you<br /><br />\nKisses, cards, and exquisite tension<br /><br />\nBy FOCAL<br />\nThe Big Day is tomorrow, but it's<br />\ngoing to be outrageous. All those kisses<br />\nand cards will be waiting for us, along<br />\nRobert Mario Bencivenga with that exquisite tension.

This includes studio arts,<br />\nanthropology, comparative literature,<br />\ntheology, many foreign languages, and<br />\nother fields. JHU has no junior year<br />\nabroad, an experience all foreign language<br />\nspeakers should have access to. Such<br />\nprograms in no way \"dilute\" a JHU<br />\neducation, rather they enrich it.<br />\nYes, of course JHU feels the money<br />\ncrunch. Don't we all?

One Big Day a<br />\nnot lead students, very justifiably, to<br />\nyear is enough.<br />\nwant to finish early. Dean Suskind seems<br />\nTomorrow is an important holiday<br />\nto look at studnets more as a source of<br />\npartially because it's the anniversary of<br />\nrevenue than as people trying to fit an<br />\nsignificant historical events. It's the day<br />\neducation to their needs.<br />\nwhen the people in pre-Christain Rome<br />\nA policy forbidding or discouraging<br />\nearly graduation and other prepared for the feast of the Lupercalia, a<br />\n\"credit-grabbing\" programs such as celebration which promised cures for<br /><br />\nsterility and required its priests to laugh.<br />\nIn 269A.D. a priest of the Roman Church<br />\nnamed Valentine was cruelly beaten and<br />\nthen beheaded by order of Claudius II.<br />\nTwo years ago Debbie failed to send me a<br />\ncard, and Jennifer will find one with my<br />\nname tomorrow, which is only<br />\npotentially significant.<br /><br />\nValentine's Day is almost always<br />\ntraumatic, probably because it's one of<br />\nthe few days which absolutely requires<br />\nadvance planning. People don't mind if<br />\nyour Christmas card arrives after New<br />\nYear's, but a valentine on the fifteenth is<br />\nno good at all. If you're not nervous<br />\nenough to mail the card two or three days<br />\ntoo early, you must be bored with the<br /><br />\naddressee; you're definitely not<br />\ninfatuated. Receiving a valentine on the<br />\nthirteenth is very impressive.<br />\nFifteen years ago it wasn't so<br />\ncomplicated because we didn't worry.<br />\nMiss Elliot (first grade) and Mrs.<br />\nStephenson (second grade) made the day<br />\nas mindless as they possibly could, telling<br />\nus to use those blunt-edged scissors until<br />\nwe had enough heart shapes for everyone,<br />\nfriend or eilemy. Alliances were always<br />\nchanging, and the fact that Candy handed<br />\nme a card which said \"I love you\" didn't<br />\nmean she would choose me for her<br />\nkickball team.<br />\n(Of course, I didn't care about that<br />\nbecause I had an eye for Mary, an<br />\neight-year-old charmer who wooed me<br />\nwith drawings of sea monsters.)<br />\n\"With love\"<br />\nMaybe we understood relationships<br />\nbetter when we were children, because<br />\nnow we worry. We worry about what<br />\nPerry or Donna is trying to say by<br />\nsending or not sending a card. If Perry<br />\nkicked you in the second grade, you<br />\ncould understand him; but if he sends a<br />\nHallmark card tomorrow, you'll spend an<br />\nhour decoding the little poem and the<br />\nreason he wrote \"with love\" instead of<br />\n\"with all my love.\" Soul searching used<br />\nto be an unknown, which makes me<br />\nappreciate Candy.<br />\nThere's also no longer a guarantee of<br />\nTeceiving a valentine. Miss Elliot fixed<br />\nthe odds, but my History professor isn't<br />\ninterested in helping a match. During the<br />\nLupercalia, the Romans tried to prevent<br />\ndisappointments by having the young<br />\npeople draw names out of a love urn.<br />\nBut I rather take my chances than<br />\nstand in line for something which<br />\ncouldn't be special. If I get a note from<br />\nJennifer, it will make up for all the<br />\nproblems of two years ago. I prefer to<br />\ntake outrageous chances.<br />\nIt's almost time to check the mail.<br /><br />\nwhich of the actors moves like some<br />\nmixture of Chaplin and Frankenstein,<br />\naccording to the director, or which one I<br />\nthink moves like a Mack truck. I also<br />\nwouldn't tell you which member of the<br />\ncast is only suited to play heavies, not<br />\nsuch light stuff. And then I wouldn't give<br />\naway the bizarre, surprise ending. So the<br />\nwhole point is that you should go see the<br />\nshow to find out all that stuff.<br />\nNow the play does have its problems.<br />\nIt's funny but it's not fun. You forget the<br />\nlines you laugh at, and though you might<br />\nnot stop laughing during the second act,<br />\nyou stop during the curtain call. Orton<br />\nhas written a lot of funny lines. Funny<br />\nlines, however, don't necessarily develop<br />\ncharacters, and then, of course, certain<br />\nactors just can't develop characters. Now<br />\nI'm not going to mention any names<br />\n('cause I've still got to face these people),<br />\nexcept for Alan Fink. He's great. I only<br />\nwish he was on stage more often, because<br />\nwhen he is on, the play really moves. He's<br />\ngot a real comic sense about him and he<br />\nknows how to use it on stage. The rest of<br />\nthe cast doesn't hurt the play so much.<br />\nThey just don't help it. It's not that<br /><br />\nthey're nondescript (Mack trucks really<br />\naren't nondescript). I'd just rather not<br />\nhave to describe them.<br />\nSomething about the play to entice<br />\nyou to come: Orton has written an<br />\nextremely comical satire on institutional<br />\npsychiatry and psychoanalysis in general.<br />\nThe plot is very complex with numerous<br />\ntwists and ironies. In the style of English<br />\ndrawing-room comedies, there are<br />\nmistaken identities, curtain scenes, and<br />\nMUCH DISROBING. The bizarre,<br />\nsurprise ending concludes the satire and,<br />\nin a sense shifts the attack of the satire<br />\nfrom psychiatry to the form of the play<br />\nitself. The play becomes a spoof on itself<br />\nand the genre of the drawing-room<br />\ncomedies, by satirizing its subject to the<br />\npoint of farce.<br />\nOn behalf of the actors it must be said<br />\nthat with one or two exceptions, Orton<br />\nreally hasn't developed characters so<br />\nmuch as humorous situations. The play<br />\nmakes for great reading, but it is difficult<br />\nto play.<br />\nThe director, Lee Dorsey, did a fairly<br />\ngood job of staging the numerous<br />\nentrances and exits, but he too had some<br />\nproblems. I can't understand, for<br />\ninstance, why he had Don Goldstein yell<br />\nin a monotone through all of his speeches<br />\n(in terms of inside dope, however, that<br />\nproblem is a directorial problem and not<br />\nDon's).<br />\nNow, after all that I think I have left<br />\nmyself room to recommend it. The play<br />\nis genuinely funny and it really has some<br />\nsuperb moments. It's definitely worth the<br />\nmoney. My only complaint was that it<br />\nisn't as good as it could have been.<br />\nUnder Milkwood: Whatever you do,<br />\nthough, go see it. The show is the best<br />\nthing to be presented on a Hopkins stage<br />\nin two years. The play traces the events<br />\nand characters of the town of Llaregubb<br />\nfrom midnight one day to midnight the<br />\nnext. Each actor plays a few characters.<br />\nGarath Esersky, a Goucher senior, has<br />\ndone an amazing job of direction,<br />\ncombinging an informal atmosphere with<br />\na highly polished dramatic presentation.<br />\nThe whole cast gives an excellent<br />\nperformance. Three, however, stand out<br />\nfrom the rest. Sally Fuller is extremely<br />\nexciting, Diane Reese absolutely exquisite<br />\n(the real star of the show),and John Kidd<br />\nis some equally superlative adjective.<br /><br />\npage 6/news-letter/february 13, 1973<br /><br />\n'Adjunct Professorship' announced by Owen<br /><br />\nCOUrSeS<br /><br />\nan assistant professor of medical<br />\nintellectual community in our<br />\nBy PETER GARDNER<br />\npsychology and pediatrics at the<br />\nThe creation of a new type of area.\"<br />\nMedical<br />\nSchool.<br />\nappointments<br />\nfirst<br />\ntwo<br />\nThe<br />\nbe<br />\nteaching appointment to<br />\nAs<br />\nadjunct<br />\nprofessor at the<br />\nare.<br />\nprogram<br />\nthe<br />\nnew<br />\nunder<br />\nwas<br />\nprofessor<br />\nadjunct<br />\nas<br />\nknown<br />\nUniversity, she is teaching a<br />\nMarjorie Harley, a psychologist<br />\nannounced recently by Dr.<br />\npsychology course entitled<br />\nspecializing in child and adult<br />\nGeorge Owen, Dean of the<br />\n\"Metapsychological<br />\nAspects of<br />\nof<br />\ntwo<br />\nthe<br />\nholder<br />\nanalysis and<br />\nFaculty of Arts and Sciences.<br />\nPsychoanalytic<br />\nTheory.\"<br />\nThe<br />\nprofessorships<br />\nat<br />\nthe<br />\nassistant<br />\na<br />\nwill<br />\nbe<br />\nThe new position<br />\ncourse is described as a survey of<br />\nJohns Hopkins School of<br />\npart-time appointment offered<br />\npsychoanalytic theory Presented<br />\nMedicine, and the Reverend<br />\nfor one year to oustanding<br />\nwithin<br />\nthe framework of<br />\nFrancis X.
