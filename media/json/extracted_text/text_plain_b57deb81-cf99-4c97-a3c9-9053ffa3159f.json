You can get<br />\nconfidence in talking to<br />\nbusinessmen t- you learn how to<br />\nsell yourself.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fpage 4/news-letter/march 8, 1974<br />\n<br />\nThree trustee candidates air their views on questions<br />\nTRUSTEE, from page 16<br />\nundergraduate situation at Hopkins. First<br />\nof all, it's important to observe that no<br />\nTrustee is supposed to serve a particular<br />\nor individual constituency. It's not<br />\nrealistic to expect the Young Trustee for<br />\nexample just to be the representative of<br />\nthe interests of the undergraduates for<br />\nexample as an Alumni member for the<br />\nBoard doesn't just represent the interests<br />\nof the Alumni. However you can look at<br />\nundergraduate education and the position<br />\nof the undergraduate at Hopkins as being<br />\nthe real backbone of the University,<br />\nreally its reason for existing, and that<br />\nmost of the other parts of the University<br />\nreally only exist because of the presence<br />\n,of the undergraduates Whether its<br />\nresearch or undergraduate tuition enable<br />\nmoney to pay the salaries of those who<br />\ndon't participate with the undergraduates<br />\nand have a direct bearing on<br />\nundergraduates. The Board cannot effect<br />\nthe hiring and firing of professors but the<br />\nBoard can influence how money is raised<br />\nand delegated for use by undergraduates<br />\nfor undergraduate education, Univercif,,<br />\nhousing or facilities like the Union or the<br />\nLibrary. I think the Board has some<br />\ninfluence to use there. Another thing that<br />\nthe Board can take up I feel is the whole<br />\nidea of fiscal responsibility in the<br />\nUniversity where the Board is responsibile<br />\nfinancially for the University at the same<br />\ntime I think the Board should approach<br />\nthe same level of excellence that<br />\ntheoretically is pursued on an educational<br />\nlevel with the way the University is<br />\nfinanced. What I mean is looking at<br />\nholdings in the University's portfolio and<br />\nseeing if different companies in the<br />\n<br />\nbuilding of the student union we'll have<br />\nmore of one. The Board of Trustees with<br />\nits raw decision making and economic<br />\nportfolio have policies that we think or<br />\nthe Board of Trustees think or the<br />\nUniversity community as a whole would<br />\nthink are contrary with ideals that we<br />\nhold. I'm not that familiar with the state<br />\nof the University's portfolio at present<br />\nhypothetically it was a company within<br />\nthe portfolio that exercised<br />\ndiscrimination in hiring and firing of<br />\nemployees or some practice that we<br />\n<br />\nfound we couldn't agree with. I'd like to<br />\nsee that company no longer be on the<br />\nportfolio. I think we have a good<br />\ncombination of people on the Board that<br />\nhave an awareness of social issues and also<br />\nhave an expertise in financial areas .that<br />\nthis can be accomplished without such<br />\nthings as sacrificing good financial<br />\nstanding or money for things like<br />\nundergraduate education.<br />\nJanet Schwartz One thing that I feel is<br />\nstrongly lacking at Hopkins is a campus<br />\nspirit or a campus life. Perhaps with the<br />\n<br />\nJon Tiqem<br />\n<br />\npower can affect campus activities and if<br />\nI was involved I'd like to see a more<br />\nactive campus life at Hopkins. Another<br />\nthing I'd like to see would be a greater<br />\nrepresentation on the campus of the<br />\nmany minorities we have here: women<br />\nblacks, international students, etc. They<br />\nneed a representative voice somewhere<br />\nand Hopkins should be as receptive to<br />\nthis as any other institution. Many of the<br />\nHopkins courses tend to be quite<br />\ntheoretical and very lacking in the sense. I<br />\nwould like to see something set up<br />\nwhereby the students would come into<br />\ncontact with doctors or other<br />\nprofessionals who could give them the<br />\npractical viewpoint as well. Being a<br />\ncommuter, I'd also like to see the parking<br />\nsituation alleviate somewhat.<br />\nQuestion: What do you think is\u2014the<br />\nmain 'Action of the Board of Tmstees?<br />\nJanet Schwartz: The main purpose of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees is<br />\nas a<br />\ngoverning body planning projects that<br />\nconcern the university in the academic<br />\nand financial realms. They raise the funds<br />\nand manage the funds required to run the<br />\nuniversity. They are responsible for<br />\nrunning the university and looking<br />\nforward to its future and keeping it<br />\nmodern and in date. I know what the<br />\nBoard of Trustees shouldn't do with this<br />\ncampus. They should never interfere with<br />\nan academic activity on campus and they<br />\nshould never interfere with any student<br />\nactivity. Their main function is, first of<br />\nall, to make sure that the campus is<br />\nfinancially solvent and second to<br />\nimplement and perhaps initiate policies<br />\nthat the campus body wants to<br />\nundertake. They should have no say'<br />\nwhatsoever in governing campus life.<br />\n<br />\n11111111w111111111w 441111mw A4111111! 40IIIW 44111W 14111110w 441111w 44111111w .4111111w 441111W 44111W A00110w<br />\n<br />\nYOU KNOW<br />\nHO W IT FEELS<br />\nYOU CAN HELP<br />\n<br />\nBE PART OF<br />\n<br />\nORIENTATION<br />\n'74<br />\nMeeting<br />\nThursday, March 14<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\nFreshman Dorm<br />\nSocial Lounge<br />\n<br />\nMEV<br />\n<br />\nAPSOMMOL.<br />\n<br />\nMIONIMMIND, al$316,<br />\n<br />\n.011mm..11110. 44111W 44111110. .411111w .0110.<br />\n<br />\nContact Sue Matson<br />\nBox 345<br />\n40110.

Far less threatening than a takeover of campus<br />\nbuildings, much less dangerous than the kidnapping of a<br />\nfraternity brother and now an officially certified.<br />\nphenomenon by virtue of fts ,mention on Walter<br />\nCronkite's CBS Evening News, streaking 'appears to be<br />\nhere to stay, for a while at least.<br />\n<br />\nThe phenomenon certainly has a lot of potential<br />\nStreak-ins, streak marches, streaks for peace or even<br />\nstreaks to move the add-drop date back two' weeks could<br />\neasily deluge the campus, and give the campus cops<br />\nsomething to do chasing down the offenders, although<br />\nwhat would happen if they actually caught a streaker<br />\nre mains obscure.

It's cheap, it's safe, no one gets hurt and no one<br />\nexcept the repressed is offended. In a world populated by<br />\ntoo many people with too' little gas, bread, money and<br />\njobs, a few college kids moving from swallowing goldfish<br />\nto running around with no clothes on certainly provides a<br />\nharmless diversion. If the imaginative type who backed<br />\noff his declared intention of an impeachment streak-in at<br />\nthe White House is still looking for a cause, he might<br />\nconsider moving his show to his local gas station to<br />\nentertain the long lines of customers.

But those days<br />\nare past and we now come to the<br />\ndelayed cognizance that college life<br />\nis not now, and perhaps never was,<br />\nfree from the artifices of society.<br />\nThis epilogue to a period of<br />\nunrivaled protest centers around<br />\nthe administrators and the<br />\nstudents, the obvious principals<br />\nsince the faculty members<br />\nthemselves usually remain extrinsic<br />\nin such disagreements. Faculties<br />\nindeed have become increasingly<br />\nremoved from the student rights<br />\nscene, probably because they feel<br />\nintimidated by the abrupt violence<br />\nwhich accompanied student<br />\nactivism in its heyday. As we all<br />\nknow, college professors were<br />\nfrequently chased from their<br />\noffices by SDS members; indeed<br />\nour own Dr. Orest Ranum, History<br />\nDepartment Chairman and a star of<br />\nsorts in Hopkins humanities, was<br />\ncaptured in a now famous<br />\nphotograph taken at Columbia<br />\nUniversity in 1968 which showed<br />\nhim being unceremoniously evicted<br />\nfrom his ground floor office. This<br />\nsort of thing is disturbing to<br />\nacademic types and they are, no<br />\ndoubt, terrified by any poi-tents of<br />\nits recurrence.

As such, the<br />\ncollege experience per se has been<br />\ndivested of its aura, of its extensive<br />\nreputation as a melting pot of<br />\nfrom varied<br />\nin<br />\ngeographic and ideological<br />\nbackgrounds. The college<br />\nexperience has become somewhat<br />\nmediocre.<br />\nThis mediocrity is nowhere<br />\nmore evident than on Homewood<br />\ncampus which the majority of the<br />\nHopkins student body reaches by<br />\nway of the Garden State Parkway<br />\nor New Jersey Turnpike, each the<br />\nbastard offspring of 'mediocre<br />\nurban planning.

This question is not at all so odd as it seems.<br />\nLet, us see what kind of peculiar creature the Jew is, which all the<br />\nrulers and all nations have together and separately abused and molestl ed, oppressed and persecuted, trampled and butchered, burned and<br />\nhanged - and in spite of all this is yet alive! What is a Jew, who has<br />\nnever allowed himself to be led astray by all the earthly possessions<br />\nwhich his oppressors and persecutors constantly offered him in order<br />\nthat he should change his faith and forsake his own Jewish religion?<br />\n-The Jew is that sacred being who has brought down from heaven<br />\nthe everlasting fire, and illumined with it the entire world. He is the<br />\nreligious source, spring and fountain out of which all the rest of the<br />\npeoples have drawn their belief's and their religions.<br />\n`.The Jew is the pioneer of liberty. Even in those olden days. when<br />\n.the people were divided into but two distinct classes, slaves and masters - even so long ago had the law of Moses prohibited the practice<br />\nof keeping a person in bondage for more than six years.<br />\n\"The Jew is the pioneer of civilization. ignorance was condemned<br />\nin olden, Palestine more even than it is today in civilized Europe.<br />\nMoreover, in those wild and barbarous days, when neither life nor the<br />\ndeath of anyone counted for anything at all, Rabbi Akiba did not<br />\nrefrain from expressing himself openly against capital punishment. a<br />\npractice which is recognized today as a highly civilized way of pun-<br />\n<br />\nishment.<br />\n\"The Jew is the emblem of civil and religious toleration. 'Love the<br />\nstranger and the. sojourner', Moses commands, 'because you have<br />\nbeen strangers in the land of Egypt.' And this was said in those remote and savage times when the principal ambition of the races and<br />\nnations consisted in crushing and enslaving one another. As concerns<br />\nreligious toleration, the Jewish faith is not only far from the missionary spirit of converting people of other denominations, but on the<br />\ncontrary the Talmud commands the Rabbis to inform and explain to<br />\neveryone who willingly comes to accept the Jewish religion, all the<br />\ndifficulties involved in its acceptance, and to point out to the would-be proselyte that the righteous of all nations have a share in immortality. Of such a lofty and ideal religious toleration not even the moralists of our present day can boast;<br />\n\"The Jew is the emblem of eternity. He whom neither slaughter<br />\nnor torture of thousands of years could destroy, he whom neither<br />\nfire nor sword nor inquisition was able to wipe offfrom the face of<br />\nthe earth, he who was the first to produce the oracles of God, he who<br />\nhas been for so long the guardian of prophecy. and who transmitted<br />\nit to the rest of the world - such a nation cannot be destroyed. The<br />\nJew is everlasting as is eternity itself\"<br />\nLeo Tolstoy<br />\n<br />\nNrir<br />\n<br />\n1171't$ M.; 14zu :172$<br />\nrtrr ,-17\")<br />\nrlyp<br />\n<br />\nfft71<br />\n<br />\n.\"17, 1*; r1 71'41$rn<br />\nnts,\u201eXlri<br />\n<br />\n67n<br />\n<br />\nAddress requests to NewsLetter, Box 1230, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltim&e, Maryland, 21218.Copies printed on parchment-like paper available from the School of Bereshith on request- no charge.

Not if you consider the<br />\nspecifics.<br />\nTake the problem of graduate medical education. It's a period of your life the Air Force can make<br />\nconsiderably easier with comfortable salary and living conditions.<br />\nCreature comforts aside, the Air Force offers<br />\nprofessional advantages.

But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and at civilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his practice in<br />\n<br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to hirn when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups,and a missed<br />\nappointment rate that is practically nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer.

Hopkins rarely<br />\nsettled down to their own<br />\ngamestyle against the Huskies.<br />\nThe Blue Jays had only one day<br />\nto prepare for Bloomsburg, a<br />\nteam they knew little about.<br />\nNot everyone connected with<br />\nthe Blue Jays was unaware of<br />\nBloomsburg State. The Huskies<br />\nlast appeared in the NCAA<br />\ntourney when hometown hero<br />\nGary Rupert captained the team<br />\nin 1963.<br />\nShowing no respect for their<br />\nformer star or his players, the<br />\nHuskies wantonly stole the ball<br />\nfrom the Blue Jay backcourt to<br />\nscore the first two buckets of the<br />\ngame. The discouraging start did'<br />\nnot phase Hopkins and they<br />\ncame back to take a 12-8 lead<br />\nwhile Blc,omsburg suffered a<br />\nsequence of cold shooting and<br />\npoor rebounding.<br />\n<br />\nBill Jews batted away a shot<br />\nand Bobby Freedman proceeded<br />\nto put it home for the twelfth<br />\nHopkins point. Freedman then<br />\npickpocketed the oncoming<br />\nBloomsburg guard and headed in<br />\nfor an easy layup, only to have<br />\nthe red-faced Huskie block the<br />\nshot from behind.

In<br />\ncontrast to the not-so-distant<br />\npast, the Jays themselves, rather<br />\nthan their opponents, provided<br />\nmost of the excitement. Notable<br />\nachievements of the 1973-74<br />\nedition of Hopkins hoopsters<br />\ninclude the first Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference regular-season title in<br />\nhistory, the first MAC Playoff<br />\nChampionship, the winningest<br />\nseason ever at 17-9 and the first<br />\nNCAA Playoff berth ever earned<br />\nby the Jays.<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert has<br />\nbrought the Hopkins cagers a<br />\nlong way since his arrival in the<br />\nfall of 1970. He encountered a<br />\nstruggling program here that had<br />\nrarely tasted anything sweeter<br />\nthan mediocrity. The best season<br />\nrecord prior to his arrival was<br />\n10-7 in 1940-41.

An excellent year<br />\ntogether on the freshman squad<br />\nhelped galvanize the unit (while<br />\nRupert suffered through a 9-14<br />\ncampaign), and when the '71-'72<br />\nseason began, talent of truly<br />\nvarsity caliber began to dot the<br />\nroster.<br />\nThree seasons later, we see in<br />\nfull perspective the tremendous<br />\nimpact of this group on Hopkins<br />\nbasketball.

Why do you want to<br />\nbe a Young Trustee?<br />\nHarlan Doliner: I wrote a statement for<br />\nthe candidacy that I handed in with the<br />\nsignatures and the other information that<br />\nthey required and in that I stressed two<br />\nfactors; one in that I've been a member of<br />\nthe University community in a capacity<br />\nother than an undergraduate and that I'm<br />\nearning a master's degree along with my<br />\nbachelor's degree and that's given me<br />\nsome familiarity of what it's like to be an<br />\nundergraduate students and as a gadtute<br />\nstudent here at Hopkins. I think that<br />\nthat's helped me in gaining a bit of<br />\nobjectivity about being an undergraduate<br />\nand about being in a position of Young<br />\nTrustee where you have to look at the<br />\nUniversity as a whole. I think that the<br />\nother thing is that I've been in a lot of<br />\nactivities. The one people will probably<br />\nremember most is heading the<br />\nSymposium last year, along with my<br />\nroommate Mike - the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium. I think that it's things like<br />\n<br />\nJanet<br />\n<br />\nSchwcrtz<br />\n<br />\nthat that have given me a lot of<br />\nfamiliarity with a lot of the University<br />\nand that I can go in and know people in<br />\nthe administration and a lot of the people<br />\non the faculty. This familiarity is<br />\nimportant not only in dealing with<br />\ndifferent parts of the University and<br />\ntrying to get things solved in the capacity<br />\nof a Young Trustee, but also in learning<br />\nto recognize what the problems are that<br />\nthe Board of Trustees should .do<br />\nsomething or I as a Young Trustee should<br />\ndo.<br />\nJon Ti//em: I would honestly say that<br />\nmy strongest qualification is that I've<br />\nbeen extremely .active in many diversified<br />\nareas of campus life. I've lived in the<br />\ndorms twice and have a perspective of the<br />\nUniversity and I've lived in off-campus<br />\napartments. I have an idea of the housing<br />\nsituation. in Student government, in the<br />\nadvising programs, in the Orientation<br />\nprogram. .Through my student<br />\ngovernment work, I've been Student<br />\nCouncil treasurer. I've had experience<br />\nwith the funding for undergraduates and<br />\nthe problems of undergraduate activities.<br />\nIn my 4 years here I've seen the campus<br />\nchange and the nature of the student<br />\nbody change in many ways. I would say<br />\nthat being here as a student in this period<br />\nof transition at the University I've seen a<br />\nlot of changes in the student body as a<br />\nwhole that having been active in these<br />\nchanges I'd like to see them continue. I<br />\nthink that the knowledge I've accrued<br />\nwith respect to the vafigus activities and<br />\nthe various things that concern students<br />\nthe most\u2014I would think that this would<br />\ngive me the background to apply to these<br />\nproblems if they should come up on the<br />\nBoard of Trustees. Also I would think the<br />\nknowledge would allow me to bring<br />\nthings up to the Board of Trustees which<br />\nrequires a student.<br />\nJanet Schwartz: I feel my strongest<br />\nqualifications are that I've been a student<br />\nat Hopkins for three years now, and I'm a<br />\nwoman and I feel that women need<br />\nrepresentation on the Board of Trustees<br />\nand I've also been active in other campus<br />\norganizations such as the Debate Club<br />\nwhich I am President oland the honorary<br />\nfraternity which I am also president of.<br />\nThey're activities that aren't necessarily<br />\nin the limelight alot. I think I would be<br />\nrepresentative of a segment of the<br />\n<br />\nHopkins community. I'm majoring in<br />\nIndustrial Engineering, which means that<br />\nI'll be going into management when I<br />\nleave Hopkins and I've been around the<br />\ncampus for three and a half years now. I<br />\nwant to have an active role with the<br />\ncampus after I leave it. I worked in a<br />\nnumber of different offices on campus<br />\nand I'm also a member of the band.<br />\nQuestion: What programs or in which<br />\narea of University affairs would you like<br />\nto see the Board devote attention during<br />\nits upcoming sessions?<br />\nJon Talent: I think that if the Board of<br />\nTrustees is in any way going to apply<br />\nitself to the problems of the students<br />\noutside of its normal business activities, it<br />\nwould have to devote some time in its<br />\nupcoming sessions to the problem of<br />\nhousing. The University is in the process<br />\nof raising . $100 million dollars for its<br />\nendowment and applying it to various<br />\nsections of the University, various<br />\ndepartments. And as far as I can see<br />\noutside of the idea that the library is<br />\ngoing to be improved, some money is<br />\ngoing to be spent on the library, some<br />\nmoney is going to be spent to improve<br />\nteaching in the sense that there'll be more<br />\nendowed chairs, although I don't know if<br />\nthat improves teaching;. there is going to<br />\nbe little money directed towards the<br />\nstudents. I'd say the library is probably'<br />\nthe closest point in that. I think that if it<br />\nshould so happen that we go over a<br />\nhundred million dollars, at least set aside<br />\nfor the possibility of building new<br />\nUniversity housing - dorms on campus or<br />\npossibly buying up housing in the city.<br />\nHaving worked with housing problems for<br />\nthe last two years, it's a major problem.<br />\nPeople are worried about it, it causes a lot<br />\nof grief for people and if the University<br />\nprovided .more housing along those lines_<br />\nthere would be no problem. Also there<br />\nseems to be a trend of people moving<br />\nback to the dorms. I can say this as a\u2022fact<br />\njust from the nature of the people who<br />\nlive in the dorms now and people talking<br />\nabout \"I want to stay next year.\" With<br />\nthe expanding of the freshman class, a<br />\npossibility because of the increased<br />\namount of applications, it might seem<br />\nt hat it mi ght totally force- the<br />\nupperclassmen out of the dorms. I would<br />\nthink that the University should try to<br />\n<br />\nHarlan Doliner<br />\nkeep people on campus. I mean spending<br />\nenough money on the Union trying to try<br />\nto build some central part .of the campus<br />\nto get people to come get: people out in<br />\nthe city are just not going to come back<br />\nto campus. I would think that new<br />\ndorms, whether ren ovation of the old<br />\ndorms or building new dorms someplace<br />\nelse on campus would serve in some way<br />\nto bring students closer together. The<br />\ntype of environment we have on campus<br />\nwith all freshmen on campus and nobody<br />\nelse, the freshmen themselves are virtually<br />\nsegregated from the rest of the student<br />\nbody and it just keeps them apart and<br />\nthey don't get any insights until later on.<br />\nAnd I'm not really answering the<br />\nquestion. at this point, but I would<br />\nbasically think that housing is one thing<br />\nthey should look into, and the library:<br />\nalthough money is being set aside for the<br />\nlibrary. I think a lot .can be done in the<br />\nlibrary. Mr. Stam and his staff are doing a<br />\nvery credible job but they need more<br />\nmoney and as' things look -now, the<br />\nlibrary is a very important job. It's<br />\nsomething very important for the Board<br />\nof Trustees to look into.<br />\nHarlan Dolinei: I have to agree on the<br />\nissue of housing with Jon, except I think<br />\nI would like to take it more in the<br />\ncontext of the undergraduate and the<br />\nsee TRUSTEE, page 4<br />\n<br />\nWhere To Buy It<br />\nA Favorite Rendez-Wu.<br />\nfor Hopkins Men<br />\n<br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nNEW CHINA INN<br />\nCharles Street Below 25th<br />\n<br />\nGURUICA<br />\nNatural Food Store<br />\n2T22 N.Cbaries St.<br />\n10% OFF<br />\nivith this coupon<br />\n<br />\nJEN'S<br />\n3121 St. Paul St.<br />\n<br />\nJAI HIND<br />\nINDIAN RESTAURANT<br />\nPre.rni.

You can get<br />\nconfidence in talking to<br />\nbusinessmen t- you learn how to<br />\nsell yourself.\"<br /><br />\npage 4/news-letter/march 8, 1974<br /><br />\nThree trustee candidates air their views on questions<br />\nTRUSTEE, from page 16<br />\nundergraduate situation at Hopkins. First<br />\nof all, it's important to observe that no<br />\nTrustee is supposed to serve a particular<br />\nor individual constituency. It's not<br />\nrealistic to expect the Young Trustee for<br />\nexample just to be the representative of<br />\nthe interests of the undergraduates for<br />\nexample as an Alumni member for the<br />\nBoard doesn't just represent the interests<br />\nof the Alumni. However you can look at<br />\nundergraduate education and the position<br />\nof the undergraduate at Hopkins as being<br />\nthe real backbone of the University,<br />\nreally its reason for existing, and that<br />\nmost of the other parts of the University<br />\nreally only exist because of the presence<br />\n,of the undergraduates Whether its<br />\nresearch or undergraduate tuition enable<br />\nmoney to pay the salaries of those who<br />\ndon't participate with the undergraduates<br />\nand have a direct bearing on<br />\nundergraduates. The Board cannot effect<br />\nthe hiring and firing of professors but the<br />\nBoard can influence how money is raised<br />\nand delegated for use by undergraduates<br />\nfor undergraduate education, Univercif,,<br />\nhousing or facilities like the Union or the<br />\nLibrary. I think the Board has some<br />\ninfluence to use there. Another thing that<br />\nthe Board can take up I feel is the whole<br />\nidea of fiscal responsibility in the<br />\nUniversity where the Board is responsibile<br />\nfinancially for the University at the same<br />\ntime I think the Board should approach<br />\nthe same level of excellence that<br />\ntheoretically is pursued on an educational<br />\nlevel with the way the University is<br />\nfinanced. What I mean is looking at<br />\nholdings in the University's portfolio and<br />\nseeing if different companies in the<br /><br />\nbuilding of the student union we'll have<br />\nmore of one. The Board of Trustees with<br />\nits raw decision making and economic<br />\nportfolio have policies that we think or<br />\nthe Board of Trustees think or the<br />\nUniversity community as a whole would<br />\nthink are contrary with ideals that we<br />\nhold. I'm not that familiar with the state<br />\nof the University's portfolio at present<br />\nhypothetically it was a company within<br />\nthe portfolio that exercised<br />\ndiscrimination in hiring and firing of<br />\nemployees or some practice that we<br /><br />\nfound we couldn't agree with. I'd like to<br />\nsee that company no longer be on the<br />\nportfolio. I think we have a good<br />\ncombination of people on the Board that<br />\nhave an awareness of social issues and also<br />\nhave an expertise in financial areas .that<br />\nthis can be accomplished without such<br />\nthings as sacrificing good financial<br />\nstanding or money for things like<br />\nundergraduate education.<br />\nJanet Schwartz One thing that I feel is<br />\nstrongly lacking at Hopkins is a campus<br />\nspirit or a campus life. Perhaps with the<br /><br />\nJon Tiqem<br /><br />\npower can affect campus activities and if<br />\nI was involved I'd like to see a more<br />\nactive campus life at Hopkins. Another<br />\nthing I'd like to see would be a greater<br />\nrepresentation on the campus of the<br />\nmany minorities we have here: women<br />\nblacks, international students, etc. They<br />\nneed a representative voice somewhere<br />\nand Hopkins should be as receptive to<br />\nthis as any other institution. Many of the<br />\nHopkins courses tend to be quite<br />\ntheoretical and very lacking in the sense. I<br />\nwould like to see something set up<br />\nwhereby the students would come into<br />\ncontact with doctors or other<br />\nprofessionals who could give them the<br />\npractical viewpoint as well. Being a<br />\ncommuter, I'd also like to see the parking<br />\nsituation alleviate somewhat.<br />\nQuestion: What do you think is\u2014the<br />\nmain 'Action of the Board of Tmstees?<br />\nJanet Schwartz: The main purpose of<br />\nthe Board of Trustees is<br />\nas a<br />\ngoverning body planning projects that<br />\nconcern the university in the academic<br />\nand financial realms. They raise the funds<br />\nand manage the funds required to run the<br />\nuniversity. They are responsible for<br />\nrunning the university and looking<br />\nforward to its future and keeping it<br />\nmodern and in date. I know what the<br />\nBoard of Trustees shouldn't do with this<br />\ncampus. They should never interfere with<br />\nan academic activity on campus and they<br />\nshould never interfere with any student<br />\nactivity. Their main function is, first of<br />\nall, to make sure that the campus is<br />\nfinancially solvent and second to<br />\nimplement and perhaps initiate policies<br />\nthat the campus body wants to<br />\nundertake. They should have no say'<br />\nwhatsoever in governing campus life.<br /><br />\n11111111w111111111w 441111mw A4111111! 40IIIW 44111W 14111110w 441111w 44111111w .4111111w 441111W 44111W A00110w<br /><br />\nYOU KNOW<br />\nHO W IT FEELS<br />\nYOU CAN HELP<br /><br />\nBE PART OF<br /><br />\nORIENTATION<br />\n'74<br />\nMeeting<br />\nThursday, March 14<br />\n7:00 pm<br />\nFreshman Dorm<br />\nSocial Lounge<br /><br />\nMEV<br /><br />\nAPSOMMOL.<br /><br />\nMIONIMMIND, al$316,<br /><br />\n.011mm..11110. 44111W 44111110. .411111w .0110.<br /><br />\nContact Sue Matson<br />\nBox 345<br />\n40110.

It's cheap, it's safe, no one gets hurt and no one<br />\nexcept the repressed is offended. In a world populated by<br />\ntoo many people with too' little gas, bread, money and<br />\njobs, a few college kids moving from swallowing goldfish<br />\nto running around with no clothes on certainly provides a<br />\nharmless diversion. If the imaginative type who backed<br />\noff his declared intention of an impeachment streak-in at<br />\nthe White House is still looking for a cause, he might<br />\nconsider moving his show to his local gas station to<br />\nentertain the long lines of customers.

But those days<br />\nare past and we now come to the<br />\ndelayed cognizance that college life<br />\nis not now, and perhaps never was,<br />\nfree from the artifices of society.<br />\nThis epilogue to a period of<br />\nunrivaled protest centers around<br />\nthe administrators and the<br />\nstudents, the obvious principals<br />\nsince the faculty members<br />\nthemselves usually remain extrinsic<br />\nin such disagreements. Faculties<br />\nindeed have become increasingly<br />\nremoved from the student rights<br />\nscene, probably because they feel<br />\nintimidated by the abrupt violence<br />\nwhich accompanied student<br />\nactivism in its heyday. As we all<br />\nknow, college professors were<br />\nfrequently chased from their<br />\noffices by SDS members; indeed<br />\nour own Dr. Orest Ranum, History<br />\nDepartment Chairman and a star of<br />\nsorts in Hopkins humanities, was<br />\ncaptured in a now famous<br />\nphotograph taken at Columbia<br />\nUniversity in 1968 which showed<br />\nhim being unceremoniously evicted<br />\nfrom his ground floor office.

As such, the<br />\ncollege experience per se has been<br />\ndivested of its aura, of its extensive<br />\nreputation as a melting pot of<br />\nfrom varied<br />\nin<br />\ngeographic and ideological<br />\nbackgrounds.

This question is not at all so odd as it seems.<br />\nLet, us see what kind of peculiar creature the Jew is, which all the<br />\nrulers and all nations have together and separately abused and molestl ed, oppressed and persecuted, trampled and butchered, burned and<br />\nhanged - and in spite of all this is yet alive! What is a Jew, who has<br />\nnever allowed himself to be led astray by all the earthly possessions<br />\nwhich his oppressors and persecutors constantly offered him in order<br />\nthat he should change his faith and forsake his own Jewish religion?<br />\n-The Jew is that sacred being who has brought down from heaven<br />\nthe everlasting fire, and illumined with it the entire world. He is the<br />\nreligious source, spring and fountain out of which all the rest of the<br />\npeoples have drawn their belief's and their religions.<br />\n`.The Jew is the pioneer of liberty. Even in those olden days. when<br />\n.the people were divided into but two distinct classes, slaves and masters - even so long ago had the law of Moses prohibited the practice<br />\nof keeping a person in bondage for more than six years.<br />\n\"The Jew is the pioneer of civilization. ignorance was condemned<br />\nin olden, Palestine more even than it is today in civilized Europe.<br />\nMoreover, in those wild and barbarous days, when neither life nor the<br />\ndeath of anyone counted for anything at all, Rabbi Akiba did not<br />\nrefrain from expressing himself openly against capital punishment. a<br />\npractice which is recognized today as a highly civilized way of pun-<br /><br />\nishment.<br />\n\"The Jew is the emblem of civil and religious toleration. 'Love the<br />\nstranger and the. sojourner', Moses commands, 'because you have<br />\nbeen strangers in the land of Egypt.' And this was said in those remote and savage times when the principal ambition of the races and<br />\nnations consisted in crushing and enslaving one another. As concerns<br />\nreligious toleration, the Jewish faith is not only far from the missionary spirit of converting people of other denominations, but on the<br />\ncontrary the Talmud commands the Rabbis to inform and explain to<br />\neveryone who willingly comes to accept the Jewish religion, all the<br />\ndifficulties involved in its acceptance, and to point out to the would-be proselyte that the righteous of all nations have a share in immortality. Of such a lofty and ideal religious toleration not even the moralists of our present day can boast;<br />\n\"The Jew is the emblem of eternity. He whom neither slaughter<br />\nnor torture of thousands of years could destroy, he whom neither<br />\nfire nor sword nor inquisition was able to wipe offfrom the face of<br />\nthe earth, he who was the first to produce the oracles of God, he who<br />\nhas been for so long the guardian of prophecy. and who transmitted<br />\nit to the rest of the world - such a nation cannot be destroyed.

But if you are interested, the Air Force conducts them both in-house and at civilian institutions.<br />\nThe physician already in practice can look forward to other things. If you want training in the<br />\npractice of the medicine of the future, you'll find it<br />\nin the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on<br />\ngroup medicine and preventive medicine, and the<br />\ngrowing specialty of \"family physician.\" Whatever<br />\nyour interest, there are few specialties which are not<br />\nbeing practiced in today's Air Force.<br />\nThe physician starting his practice in civilian<br />\nlife has to take into account the cost of setting up an<br />\noffice. The physician commencing his practice in<br /><br />\nthe Air Force does not. He finds his office established<br />\nfor him. Supplies and equipment readily available.<br />\nHe has many options available to hirn when treating<br />\npatients. For example,he can consult with Air Force<br />\nspecialists. He also has referral to other Air Force<br />\nfacilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not<br />\nleast, are the satisfactions that come with having<br />\nthe opportunity for regular follow-ups,and a missed<br />\nappointment rate that is practically nil.<br />\nWhether you are already a physician, or soon to<br />\nbecome one, you might find it extremely interesting<br />\nto find out what the Air Force has to offer.

Freedman then<br />\npickpocketed the oncoming<br />\nBloomsburg guard and headed in<br />\nfor an easy layup, only to have<br />\nthe red-faced Huskie block the<br />\nshot from behind. This refired<br />\nthe Pennsylvania five, and ghey<br />\noutscored the Jays 10-2 over the<br />\nnext four minutes.<br />\nWith turnovers and weak<br />\nshooting marring much of the<br />\nperiod, Hopkins and the Huskies<br />\nplayed evenly for the next several<br />\nminutes. Then disaster struck<br />\nwhile the game was tied at 24.<br />\nFreedman was called on a pair of<br />\nquestionable offensive fouls and<br />\nhad to sit .out the last five<br />\nminutes of the half.<br />\nFreedman's absence was felt<br />\ndearly, as Bloomsburg went on a<br />\n10-1 binge and held on for a<br />\n38-31 halftime advantage.<br />\nTwo minutes after the second<br />\nhalf began, Freedman was<br />\nwhistled on another miscue,<br />\nstrategically forcing him to the<br />\nbench again. Nonetheless,<br />\nHopkins managed to stay within<br />\nstriking distance of the Huskies<br />\nthrough much of the half.<br />\nMidway through the period, the<br /><br />\nBlue Jays reeled off an.8-1 streak<br />\nto close the gap to one.<br />\nHopkins missed out on a<br />\nchance to take the lead after a<br />\nChuck LaBerge hook shot when<br />\nPaul Spence had the ball stolen<br />\naway. Although the Huskie lead<br />\nwavered around the three point<br />\nrange for much of the next five<br />\nminutes, Bloomsburg seemed to<br />\nbe in control. ,<br />\nAs the clock ran down to the<br />\nfour minutes mark, Bloomsburg<br />\ntightened their defense and<br />\nchange to a deliberate game that<br />\ndeveloped into the fabled North<br />\nCarolina four corners stall.<br />\nFlustered by the tactics, Hopkins<br />\nmanaged only two points at the<br />\nvery end while the Huskies<br />\npumped in 14 to seal the final<br />\n78-63 score.<br />\nBloomsburg played the whole<br />\ngame with ,6'8\" center John<br />\nWillis, a recognized pro draft who<br />\nwas in bed with the flu. Despite<br />\nmissing him, the Huskies seemed<br />\nto have an extra man on the<br />\ncourt.<br />\nDuring the course of the<br />\ncontest, Hopkins shot only ten<br />\nfree throws while the Huskies<br />\nwere awarded 27 charity tosses.<br />\nAlso significant was the 55-35<br />\nrebound edge the Huskies<br /><br />\nBlue Jay basketball wrap-up<br />\nThe recently completed Blue<br />\nJay basketball season featured<br />\nsome of the best cage action ever<br />\nwitnessed at Homewood. In<br />\ncontrast to the not-so-distant<br />\npast, the Jays themselves, rather<br />\nthan their opponents, provided<br />\nmost of the excitement. Notable<br />\nachievements of the 1973-74<br />\nedition of Hopkins hoopsters<br />\ninclude the first Middle Atlantic<br />\nConference regular-season title in<br />\nhistory, the first MAC Playoff<br />\nChampionship, the winningest<br />\nseason ever at 17-9 and the first<br />\nNCAA Playoff berth ever earned<br />\nby the Jays.<br />\nCoach Gary Rupert has<br />\nbrought the Hopkins cagers a<br />\nlong way since his arrival in the<br />\nfall of 1970. He encountered a<br />\nstruggling program here that had<br />\nrarely tasted anything sweeter<br />\nthan mediocrity. The best season<br />\nrecord prior to his arrival was<br />\n10-7 in 1940-41. That history<br />\nhad, as a result, fed the student<br />\napathy concerning the team's\u2022<br />\nfortunes for a number of years.<br />\nRupert's predecessor, Jim<br />\nValvano, had recruited well in<br />\nthe spring .of 1970, however,<br />\nleaving Rupert with the test of<br />\nmaintaining the interest of the<br />\nrookies until they could join the<br />\nvarsity squad. An excellent year<br />\ntogether on the freshman squad<br />\nhelped galvanize the unit (while<br />\nRupert suffered through a 9-14<br />\ncampaign), and when the '71-'72<br />\nseason began, talent of truly<br />\nvarsity caliber began to dot the<br />\nroster.<br />\nThree seasons later, we see in<br />\nfull perspective the tremendous<br />\nimpact of this group on Hopkins<br />\nbasketball. Five players remain<br />\nfrom the freshmen of 1970, all of<br />\nwhom played their final game in<br />\nthe Blue last Tuesday against<br />\nBloomsburg State.

Why do you want to<br />\nbe a Young Trustee?<br />\nHarlan Doliner: I wrote a statement for<br />\nthe candidacy that I handed in with the<br />\nsignatures and the other information that<br />\nthey required and in that I stressed two<br />\nfactors; one in that I've been a member of<br />\nthe University community in a capacity<br />\nother than an undergraduate and that I'm<br />\nearning a master's degree along with my<br />\nbachelor's degree and that's given me<br />\nsome familiarity of what it's like to be an<br />\nundergraduate students and as a gadtute<br />\nstudent here at Hopkins. I think that<br />\nthat's helped me in gaining a bit of<br />\nobjectivity about being an undergraduate<br />\nand about being in a position of Young<br />\nTrustee where you have to look at the<br />\nUniversity as a whole. I think that the<br />\nother thing is that I've been in a lot of<br />\nactivities. The one people will probably<br />\nremember most is heading the<br />\nSymposium last year, along with my<br />\nroommate Mike - the Eisenhower<br />\nSymposium. I think that it's things like<br /><br />\nJanet<br /><br />\nSchwcrtz<br /><br />\nthat that have given me a lot of<br />\nfamiliarity with a lot of the University<br />\nand that I can go in and know people in<br />\nthe administration and a lot of the people<br />\non the faculty. This familiarity is<br />\nimportant not only in dealing with<br />\ndifferent parts of the University and<br />\ntrying to get things solved in the capacity<br />\nof a Young Trustee, but also in learning<br />\nto recognize what the problems are that<br />\nthe Board of Trustees should .do<br />\nsomething or I as a Young Trustee should<br />\ndo.<br />\nJon Ti//em: I would honestly say that<br />\nmy strongest qualification is that I've<br />\nbeen extremely .active in many diversified<br />\nareas of campus life. I've lived in the<br />\ndorms twice and have a perspective of the<br />\nUniversity and I've lived in off-campus<br />\napartments. I have an idea of the housing<br />\nsituation. in Student government, in the<br />\nadvising programs, in the Orientation<br />\nprogram. .Through my student<br />\ngovernment work, I've been Student<br />\nCouncil treasurer. I've had experience<br />\nwith the funding for undergraduates and<br />\nthe problems of undergraduate activities.<br />\nIn my 4 years here I've seen the campus<br />\nchange and the nature of the student<br />\nbody change in many ways. I would say<br />\nthat being here as a student in this period<br />\nof transition at the University I've seen a<br />\nlot of changes in the student body as a<br />\nwhole that having been active in these<br />\nchanges I'd like to see them continue. I<br />\nthink that the knowledge I've accrued<br />\nwith respect to the vafigus activities and<br />\nthe various things that concern students<br />\nthe most\u2014I would think that this would<br />\ngive me the background to apply to these<br />\nproblems if they should come up on the<br />\nBoard of Trustees.

I think I would be<br />\nrepresentative of a segment of the<br /><br />\nHopkins community. I'm majoring in<br />\nIndustrial Engineering, which means that<br />\nI'll be going into management when I<br />\nleave Hopkins and I've been around the<br />\ncampus for three and a half years now. I<br />\nwant to have an active role with the<br />\ncampus after I leave it. I worked in a<br />\nnumber of different offices on campus<br />\nand I'm also a member of the band.<br />\nQuestion: What programs or in which<br />\narea of University affairs would you like<br />\nto see the Board devote attention during<br />\nits upcoming sessions?<br />\nJon Talent: I think that if the Board of<br />\nTrustees is in any way going to apply<br />\nitself to the problems of the students<br />\noutside of its normal business activities, it<br />\nwould have to devote some time in its<br />\nupcoming sessions to the problem of<br />\nhousing. The University is in the process<br />\nof raising . $100 million dollars for its<br />\nendowment and applying it to various<br />\nsections of the University, various<br />\ndepartments. And as far as I can see<br />\noutside of the idea that the library is<br />\ngoing to be improved, some money is<br />\ngoing to be spent on the library, some<br />\nmoney is going to be spent to improve<br />\nteaching in the sense that there'll be more<br />\nendowed chairs, although I don't know if<br />\nthat improves teaching;. there is going to<br />\nbe little money directed towards the<br />\nstudents. I'd say the library is probably'<br />\nthe closest point in that. I think that if it<br />\nshould so happen that we go over a<br />\nhundred million dollars, at least set aside<br />\nfor the possibility of building new<br />\nUniversity housing - dorms on campus or<br />\npossibly buying up housing in the city.<br />\nHaving worked with housing problems for<br />\nthe last two years, it's a major problem.<br />\nPeople are worried about it, it causes a lot<br />\nof grief for people and if the University<br />\nprovided .more housing along those lines_<br />\nthere would be no problem. Also there<br />\nseems to be a trend of people moving<br />\nback to the dorms. I can say this as a\u2022fact<br />\njust from the nature of the people who<br />\nlive in the dorms now and people talking<br />\nabout \"I want to stay next year.\" With<br />\nthe expanding of the freshman class, a<br />\npossibility because of the increased<br />\namount of applications, it might seem<br />\nt hat it mi ght totally force- the<br />\nupperclassmen out of the dorms. I would<br />\nthink that the University should try to<br /><br />\nHarlan Doliner<br />\nkeep people on campus. I mean spending<br />\nenough money on the Union trying to try<br />\nto build some central part .of the campus<br />\nto get people to come get: people out in<br />\nthe city are just not going to come back<br />\nto campus. I would think that new<br />\ndorms, whether ren ovation of the old<br />\ndorms or building new dorms someplace<br />\nelse on campus would serve in some way<br />\nto bring students closer together. The<br />\ntype of environment we have on campus<br />\nwith all freshmen on campus and nobody<br />\nelse, the freshmen themselves are virtually<br />\nsegregated from the rest of the student<br />\nbody and it just keeps them apart and<br />\nthey don't get any insights until later on.<br />\nAnd I'm not really answering the<br />\nquestion. at this point, but I would<br />\nbasically think that housing is one thing<br />\nthey should look into, and the library:<br />\nalthough money is being set aside for the<br />\nlibrary. I think a lot .can be done in the<br />\nlibrary. Mr. Stam and his staff are doing a<br />\nvery credible job but they need more<br />\nmoney and as' things look -now, the<br />\nlibrary is a very important job. It's<br />\nsomething very important for the Board<br />\nof Trustees to look into.<br />\nHarlan Dolinei: I have to agree on the<br />\nissue of housing with Jon, except I think<br />\nI would like to take it more in the<br />\ncontext of the undergraduate and the<br />\nsee TRUSTEE, page 4<br /><br />\nWhere To Buy It<br />\nA Favorite Rendez-Wu.<br />\nfor Hopkins Men<br /><br />\nJIMMY WU'S<br />\nNEW CHINA INN<br />\nCharles Street Below 25th<br /><br />\nGURUICA<br />\nNatural Food Store<br />\n2T22 N.Cbaries St.<br />\n10% OFF<br />\nivith this coupon<br /><br />\nJEN'S<br />\n3121 St. Paul St.<br /><br />\nJAI HIND<br />\nINDIAN RESTAURANT<br />\nPre.rni.
