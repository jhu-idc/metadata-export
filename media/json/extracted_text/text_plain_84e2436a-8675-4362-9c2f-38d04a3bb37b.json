Under the new<br />\nsystem, the Selections<br />\nCommittee screens the topics<br />\ninitially and submits 80 per cent<br />\nto the student body, and then<br />\nselects one of the three topics<br />\nreceiving a plurality in the<br />\nballoting.<br />\nLast year, the Selections<br />\nCommittee filtered down the<br />\noriginal, pool of topics to four,<br />\nfrom which students selected the<br />\nsymposium topic in a vote.<br />\n<br />\nSeveral of the sponsors of this<br />\nyear's proposals expressed<br />\ndissatisfaction with the selection<br />\nsystem, Fredman said.<br />\nMajor complaints were: 1) that<br />\nall information about a proposal<br />\nshould be disseminated to the<br />\nstudent body, 2) that too many<br />\ntopics are submitted on the<br />\nballot and 3) the Selections<br />\nCommittee should not have the<br />\nfinal decision.<br />\nFredman said that it is<br />\ninappropriate to release a speaker<br />\nlist before the people involved<br />\n<br />\nare contacted and recruited. He<br />\nstated that names of the student<br />\nwho submitted proposals are and<br />\nshould be withheld to prevent a<br />\npolitical selection.<br />\nSince this information is not<br />\navailable to the public, Fredman<br />\nasserted that the Selections<br />\nCommittee is therefore more<br />\nqualified to choose.<br />\n\"The Selection Committee<br />\nmay not pick the best over all<br />\ntopics submitted, but it will<br />\nselect the best of those chosen by<br />\nthe student body,\" Fredman<br />\n<br />\nJakie to tighten his belt a notch or two<br />\nlook at each position in his office<br />\nbefore determining what action is<br />\ncalled for.<br />\n\"I have refrained from filling<br />\nthat position,\" Hall explained,<br />\n\"but I won't make any firm<br />\ndecision on it until I've evaluated<br />\nthe whole office.\"<br />\nThough some staff reduction<br />\nbeyond the elimination of the<br />\nExecutive Assistant position may<br />\nbe necessary, a redistribution of<br />\nresponsibility among the office's<br />\npresent staff may take place as an<br />\nalternative economizing measure,<br />\nthe Dean emphasized.<br />\n\"I'm going to try to see which<br />\nway we can spread out people so<br />\nnot to hurt the quality of the<br />\nservices offered,\" he explained.<br />\n\"I will examine each position.\"<br />\nHall asserted that he will not<br />\nenact staff or service cutbacks<br />\nwhich would curtail services<br />\noffered by his office. \"I want to<br />\nsee how best to make the Dean<br />\n<br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nDean of Students Jakie Hall<br />\nwill examine his office's staff and<br />\nservice expenditures this summer<br />\nin an effort to \"see where things<br />\ncan be tightened up without<br />\nhurting the quality of student<br />\nservices.\"<br />\nFormer Dean of Students<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick pledged last<br />\nsemester to re-evaluate the staff<br />\nresponsibilities in the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office with an eye<br />\n\u2022towards reducing the number of<br />\nstaff positions.<br />\nHall said yesterday that along<br />\nthis line he will \"look at the<br />\n<br />\nwhole Dean of Students<br />\noperation\" and try to \"tighten it<br />\nup wherever I can.\"<br />\nThe position of Executive<br />\nAssistant to the Dean of Students<br />\nwill be eliminated next year<br />\nwhen Barbara Roth, who<br />\npresently holds the post, leaves<br />\nHopkins for a similar position<br />\nelsewhere, Hall revealed.<br />\nHe said that the position of<br />\nAssistant to the Union Director,<br />\nwhich has been unfilled since<br />\nMitch Clarvit resigned in<br />\nFebruary, may also be abolished.<br />\nHowever, this move is \"only a<br />\npossibility,\" Hall said, and he will<br />\n<br />\npresident of World Federalists,<br />\nU.S.A.\u2014organizations working<br />\nfor world peace through world<br />\nlaw.

After being asked last week to select<br />\nthree topics fro'm a selected field without knowing who their<br />\nauthors were, all so that the Student Council Selections Committee could have the final say anyway, we're sure that the<br />\nrecently approved method is neither fair nor effective.<br />\nUnder the earlier system, undergraduates selected the topic<br />\nfrom a screened field. Now the Selections Committee screens<br />\nthe proposals before and after the voting, picking the winner<br />\nfrom among the top three vote-getters. As always, the names of<br />\nthose students submitting topics was withheld during last<br />\nweek's balloting.<br />\nWe object first of all to the fact that the Selections Committee exercises unilateral jurisdiction over the field of submissions<br />\nbefore and after the student body has had its say. The original<br />\npurpose of allowing the committee to review the proposals prior<br />\nto voting was to weed opt frivolous or unmanageable proposals.<br />\nNow, apparently, The Student Council feels that its Selections<br />\npanel must review the judgement of the undergraduate student<br />\nbody as well.<br />\nWe also take exception to the present tactic of withholding<br />\nthe names of the topics' authors. When students vote for a<br />\ntopic, they want to know who is going to supervise it if it is<br />\neventually selected. The present method forces students to vote<br />\nsomewhat blindly, equipped with only half of what, by right,<br />\nthey should know before making a selection. At present, evaluation of the proposals' sponsors is left up to the Selections Committee, a group of five SC reps. We propose that this forum be<br />\nexpanded somewhat\u2014like to include the entire student body.<br />\nFurthermore, we feel that the excessively bureaucratic format of the system\u2014committee, then to vote, then to committee<br />\nto choose from the top three\u2014will serve to discourage undergraduate interest in the Symposium selection. Student participation is, in fact minimal now, with the student body allowed to<br />\ngive a worthless approbation that is subject to the final ministrations of the almighty Selections Committee.<br />\nThough some politicking might result if the names were made<br />\npublic and the student body's vote made final, we feel that,<br />\nwith the Selections Committee still allowed to screen out frivolous submissions, open campaigning would be better than the<br />\ndisallowed sort that went on prior to last week's vote, disadvantaging those who chose to adhere to the committee's rules for<br />\nselection.<br />\nSince the Symposium is an important undergraduate function, undergraduates should play a larger\u2014or at least more real<br />\n\u2014part in determining who's going to run it.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022,,\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nWell, theFair done come and<br />\ngone. Despite a merciless , washout on Friday, the sunny skies of<br />\nSaturday & Sunday sent thousands of people to Homewood4<br />\nto witness the increasingly legendary holiday at Hopkins.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nsilberner<br />\n<br />\nThis was a fair of surprises. Overnight the campus was<br />\ntransformed into a sprawling mass of<br />\ncrafts, oyster shells and lost children.<br />\nMusic was continuous, and was often performed simultaneously in front of the<br />\nGilman and Shriver quads. Mitch<br />\nClarvit returned - to the stage sounding<br />\nbetter than ever before, backed by, the<br />\nincredible local group, Northern Light.<br />\nStone Soup's natural food booth attracted scores ofpeople with its apricot bread<br />\nand egg rolls. Clowns were everywhere,<br />\ndancing on the lacrosse field, riding motorcycles and handing out balloons with<br />\nthe generosity of P.T. Barnum's rapscallions.<br />\nAnd so, once the rain quit, an air of<br />\necstatic frenzy overtook Homewood, the<br />\nglory of Hopkins shinin' through like burnin'coal.<br />\n<br />\ns<br />\n<br />\nThe Carlin hoax-only at Hopkms<br />\n<br />\nto a escria e what happened Sunday<br />\n<br />\nwhen, nearing the end of a long<br />\nand successful Spring Fair, a<br />\nslender, bearded Dundalk resident<br />\nmanaged to convince Alan Sapakie<br />\nand some members of the Fair<br />\nBoard that he was George Carlin<br />\nand that he was going to close out<br />\nthe festival with one of his<br />\nroutines\u2014gratis<br />\nIt was a wild end to a glorious<br />\nFair which seemed to get more and<br />\nmore out of control as the<br />\nfinale\u2014Ocean Rose, Rodeo Rick,<br />\nfireworks, and of course George<br />\nCarlin\u2014drew near. The campus was<br />\nliterally inundated with people all<br />\nweekend, but somehow there<br />\nseemed to be more of them<br />\nSunday afternoon\u2014more students,<br />\nmore members of the community,<br />\nand more than the usual quota of<br />\nHampden toughs.<br />\nAll afternoon Sapakie and his<br />\nsubordinates had been announcing<br />\nover the sound systems in front of<br />\nShriver and Gilman Halls that<br />\nGeorge Carlin was going to appear<br />\nin the freshman quad after the<br />\nfireworks\u2014for free. And so, as the<br />\nsun began to go down and exhibits<br />\nbegan to close up, people<br />\ngravitated towards Homewood<br />\nHouse, where Ocean Rose was<br />\ntuning up.<br />\nAfter Ocean Rose, one would<br />\nhear Rodeo Rick, then fireworks,<br />\nand then George Carlin.<br />\nBut something was terribly<br />\nwrong with Ocean Rose.<br />\n<br />\ncouldn't play their schedulecY set.<br />\n<br />\nSo then the crowd\u2014swiftly<br />\ngrowing into an amorphous<br />\nblob\u2014made its way over to the<br />\nmiddle of the freshman quad<br />\nwhere Rodeo Rick was getting<br />\nready for its set. Now,, with the<br />\nsun down, nothing but a beer<br />\nconcession open, and over a<br />\nthousand people gathered in front<br />\nof the dorm cafeteria, things<br />\nbecame surreal.<br />\nThe crowd, now a throng,<br />\npressed up against the bandstand,<br />\nblocking the speakers, making it<br />\nimpossible for the sound men to<br />\nget the mix down. And during this<br />\nconfusion, a slender, bearded<br />\nDundalk man was being plyed with<br />\nsandwiches and beer by a<br />\ntriumphant Alan Sapakie, who was<br />\nsure he'd just pulled the all-time<br />\nprogramming coup\u2014George Carlin<br />\nfor the finale, after the fireworks, a<br />\nsuperfinale, and for free to boot.<br />\nRodeo Rick, after some<br />\ndifficulty, began to play. But the<br />\ncrowd was still growing, spreading<br />\nthroughout the quad, unaware of<br />\nits own magnitude. Standing<br />\ninside, one was pressed from every<br />\ndirection, against the man behind<br />\nyou, nose-first into the chest of the<br />\nman in front of you.<br />\nSo tight was the squeeze that<br />\none narrowly avoided a fight with<br />\na man with a wooden leg who one<br />\nwas shoved flat up against.<br />\n\"Ease up, huh?\" was the<br />\nrequest.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor.<br />\nA man, purporting to be<br />\ncomedian George Carlin, came on<br />\ncampus Sunday morning and<br />\nintroduced himself to us as the<br />\nsame.

To show his<br />\ngratitude, he agreed to do a free<br />\nshow in the Freshman Quadrangle<br />\nafter the fireworks.<br />\nWe, the Fair Board, believed this<br />\nman for the following reasons:<br />\n1. He resembled George Carlin<br />\n(see the beard).<br />\n2. Ho sounded a lot like George<br />\nCarlin.<br />\n3. We wanted to believe he was<br />\nGeorge Carlin and would provide<br />\nan exciting finale to the Fair.<br />\n4. On Sunday we were all pretty<br />\nexhausted.<br />\nTo make a long story short, the<br />\n<br />\nguy was an imposter and the only<br />\nthing we had to laugh at was<br />\nourselves.<br />\nWe would like to point out that<br />\nwe didn't give the man a penny.<br />\nWe would also like to say that we<br />\nhad no intention of fooling<br />\nanyone.

From the<br />\nrear, all manner of Hampden<br />\nrabble were making slurred song<br />\nrequests. And from the side (his<br />\nleft side) a huge beast of a man was<br />\nholding a jug of moonshine and<br />\nmaking a specific and<br />\nunceremonious plea: \"Will you<br />\nassholes play `K.C.

Everybody was waiting<br />\nfor George Carlin.<br />\nThe music continued, and<br />\nRodeo Rick's smooth vocals had<br />\nplacated the throng to' some<br />\ndegree. Dancing, drinking, the<br />\ncrowd, like the savage it resembled,<br />\nwas appeased by song. But the<br />\nscene was still nothing less than<br />\nsurreal.

Carlin has a<br />\nnon-descript, radio announcer's<br />\nvoice. The slender bearded<br />\ngentleman from Dundalk had a<br />\nBaltimore accent a mile thick...and<br />\nhe wasn't funny.

The win solidified the Jays<br />\nhold on the number one spo tin<br />\nthe USILA coaches poll and lifts<br />\ntheir overall season slate to 8-0.<br />\nAccording to coach Ciccarone<br />\nthere were three main reasons for<br />\nthe poor play on the part of the<br />\nHopkins stickmen. \"First, there<br />\nwas an obvious letdown after<br />\nCornell,\" noted the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor. \"Second, an incident<br />\noccurred after the Cornell game<br />\nin which Franz Wittelsberger,.<br />\nDon Kurz, and Jack Deckelbaum<br />\n<br />\nbroke a team rule and that<br />\nresulted in one-game suspensions<br />\nfor each of the players, and the<br />\nthird, and most important reason<br />\nis that Brown is a good team.\"<br />\nRanked seventh in the nation,<br />\nthe Bruins stormed , into<br />\nHomewood and outhustled the<br />\nBlue Jays, forcing Hopkins into<br />\nbad passes and beating the Jays<br />\nto ground balls all afternoon.<br />\n\"They showed fine stickwork<br />\nand forced us to play as poorly as<br />\nwe did,\" noted Ciccarone.<br />\nHopkins never trailed in the<br />\ngame but it was obvious that the<br />\nJays were struggling to keep their<br />\nheads above water.<br />\nGeorge Johnson, playing in<br />\nWittelsberger's spot, scored the<br />\nfirst two goals and Hopkins went<br />\n<br />\nrack team loses<br />\nvaluable member<br />\nDisappointment hit the track<br />\nteam this weekend as Oscar<br />\nSchreiber suffered an injury<br />\nwhich prematurely ended a fine<br />\ncollege track career. The<br />\ntri-captain was participating in<br />\nthe Delmarva Relays at Salisbury<br />\nwhen he pulled a muscle in the<br />\nlong jump event.<br />\nCoach Don Masken expressed<br />\ndeep regret at the loss in saying,<br />\n\"It's a shanie that this injury<br />\nhad to occur after he had<br />\nperformed so magnificently for<br />\nour team over a four year period.<br />\nIt is a great loss for our team.\"<br />\nThe muscle pull came after<br />\nSchreiber had been part of the<br />\nsprint medley team that finished<br />\nthird at Salisbury. The team<br />\nconsisted of Lon Massaglia, John<br />\nCoad, and Bob Alworth who ran<br />\nan 880\u2014yard time of 1:58.3,<br />\nalong with Schreiber. They ran<br />\nthe mile in 3:34.7. Mark<br />\nMcConnell took second place in<br />\nthe meet with a high jump that<br />\nmeasured 6-2.<br />\nThe team of Bob Alworth,<br />\nBob Oates, Craig Snyder and<br />\n<br />\nSchreiber also travelled to the<br />\nPenn Relays and took fourth in a<br />\nclose mile relay which saw four<br />\nteams finish with times of<br />\n3:24.4.<br />\nVictories<br />\nIn other action last week, the<br />\nHopkins team gained two<br />\nvictories over Loyola and<br />\nWestern Maryland to move their<br />\nrecord to 904. The meets were<br />\nheld as a double dual meet for<br />\nHopkins on the Homewood Field<br />\nas the Blue Jays won by scores of<br />\n90-45 and 87-58. The day was<br />\nhighlighted by Rick Nelson's pole<br />\nvault of 13-11<br />\n/<br />\n2 which broke the<br />\nschool record of 12-71/4 set in<br />\n1968.<br />\nOther fine performances were<br />\nturned in by Lon Massaglia in the<br />\n100-yard dash, Earl Dryer and<br />\nBob Oates in the 440, and Mark<br />\nMc Connell in the high jump and<br />\nhigh hurdles.<br />\nOther scorers were Jim<br />\nKennedy, John Veil, Mark<br />\nHylind, John Coad, and Oscar<br />\nSchreiber in the long and triple<br />\njumps.<br />\n<br />\nfrom there to a 4-2 lead after one<br />\nquarter and 7-4 after two.<br />\nBrown came out fired up after<br />\nintermission and shut out the<br />\nJays in the third quarter while<br />\nfiring in two goals themselves,<br />\ncutting the Hopkins lead to 7-6.<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHogan to move all her players up<br />\na notch, further deflating the<br />\nteam's ability to win.<br />\nIn spite of all this, Coach<br />\nHogan was satisfied that the<br />\nwomen were able to keep<br />\nplaying. She was pleased that her<br />\nracketeers performed so well in<br />\nthe Maryland Association of<br />\nIntercollegiate Athletics for<br />\nWomen Tourney, finishing fourth<br />\nout of ten teams. The<br />\ntournament play gave the team<br />\nsome experience and exposure to<br />\ntop level competition.<br />\nThe team's best outing came at<br />\nthe expense of uptown rival<br />\nNotre Dame. After Sandy Ciciora<br />\nwas upended in the opening<br />\nsingles match, Susan Thomas,<br />\nLisa Kuhar, Gwen Pavlovitz, and<br />\nHeidi Hill outstroked NotreDame in straight sets in the rest<br />\nof the singles action. Hopkins'<br />\ntwo doubles teams of Lin<br />\nMurphy-Cathy Cramer and Linda<br />\nChi-Marlene Tandy swept their<br />\nchallengers in straight sets. The<br />\nfinal score was 6-1 in favor of the<br />\nJays.<br />\n<br />\ngame overtime win over Virginia,<br />\nthe Blue Jays rose to the<br />\noccasion, firing in four<br />\nconsecutive unanswered goals by<br />\nO'Neill, Kohler (2) and<br />\nZimmerman, breaking the tie and<br />\nsetting up the 13-10 triumph.<br />\n<br />\narts<br />\n<br />\nBaseball reverses losing trend<br />\nBy DAVID KRAUS<br />\nLed by the power-hitting of<br />\nDave Emala and the effective<br />\npitching of Billy Jones, the Blue<br />\nJay baseball team snapped a five<br />\ngame losing streak, downing the<br />\nTowson State Tigers 5-3<br />\nyesterday in a game played on<br />\nthe loser's field.<br />\nHopkins<br />\nEmala, the<br />\ncenterfielder, had a stellar<br />\nafternoon with the bat,<br />\ncontributing a pair of doubles<br />\nand a triple, while driving in four<br />\nruns and scoring the fifth.<br />\nJones hurled well in gaining<br />\nthe victory. He scattered nine<br />\nhits, while adding another<br />\ncomplete game to his record.<br />\n<br />\nFollowing two rather quiet<br />\ninnings, the men from<br />\nHomewood opened the scoring in<br />\nthe top of the third. Tom<br />\nPedroni singled and stole second.<br />\nLou Podrazik drew a walk to set<br />\nthe stage for Emala. The<br />\nfreshman drove a ball into<br />\nright-center for the first of his<br />\ntwo-baggers, scoring Pedroni and<br />\nPodrazik.<br />\nTowson State got back one<br />\nrun in the bottom of the fram on<br />\na single, a walk and anothei<br />\nsingle.<br />\nThe top of the fourth looked<br />\nlike a repeat of the previous<br />\ninning. With two outs, Pedroni<br />\nand Podrazik received walks to<br />\n<br />\ngive Emala another chance.<br />\nAgain the centerfielder<br />\nresponded. He smacked a ball<br />\ninto an almost identical spot in<br />\nright-center for the two-run<br />\ntriple.<br />\nThe next two innings,<br />\nalthough devoid of scoring, had<br />\nan abundance of excitement. The<br />\nTowson State cpach was thrown<br />\nout of the baLlgune while protesting<br />\na call at second base.<br />\nEmala continued his one-man<br />\nassault on the Tigers pitching in<br />\nthe seventh.

In Monday's<br />\nvictory over Towson State, the<br />\nHopkins freshman went<br />\n<br />\nRackettes give spring encore<br />\nBy ROBERT ROSENWASSER<br />\nAlthough the Hopkins<br />\nWomen's Varsity Tennis Team<br />\nplays its regular season in thz fall,<br />\nCoach Joyce Hogan's team<br />\nplayed an informal schedule<br />\nagainst area teams this spring.<br />\nThe emphasis was on playing and<br />\nkeeping their strokes in shape in<br />\npreparation for the fall. Winning<br />\nwas not the key, as the team<br />\nfinished with a 1-5 record.<br />\nOne reason for Hopkins<br />\ndismal showing was their<br />\ninability to get in much practice<br />\ntime.

Under the new<br />\nsystem, the Selections<br />\nCommittee screens the topics<br />\ninitially and submits 80 per cent<br />\nto the student body, and then<br />\nselects one of the three topics<br />\nreceiving a plurality in the<br />\nballoting.<br />\nLast year, the Selections<br />\nCommittee filtered down the<br />\noriginal, pool of topics to four,<br />\nfrom which students selected the<br />\nsymposium topic in a vote.<br /><br />\nSeveral of the sponsors of this<br />\nyear's proposals expressed<br />\ndissatisfaction with the selection<br />\nsystem, Fredman said.<br />\nMajor complaints were: 1) that<br />\nall information about a proposal<br />\nshould be disseminated to the<br />\nstudent body, 2) that too many<br />\ntopics are submitted on the<br />\nballot and 3) the Selections<br />\nCommittee should not have the<br />\nfinal decision.<br />\nFredman said that it is<br />\ninappropriate to release a speaker<br />\nlist before the people involved<br /><br />\nare contacted and recruited. He<br />\nstated that names of the student<br />\nwho submitted proposals are and<br />\nshould be withheld to prevent a<br />\npolitical selection.<br />\nSince this information is not<br />\navailable to the public, Fredman<br />\nasserted that the Selections<br />\nCommittee is therefore more<br />\nqualified to choose.<br />\n\"The Selection Committee<br />\nmay not pick the best over all<br />\ntopics submitted, but it will<br />\nselect the best of those chosen by<br />\nthe student body,\" Fredman<br /><br />\nJakie to tighten his belt a notch or two<br />\nlook at each position in his office<br />\nbefore determining what action is<br />\ncalled for.<br />\n\"I have refrained from filling<br />\nthat position,\" Hall explained,<br />\n\"but I won't make any firm<br />\ndecision on it until I've evaluated<br />\nthe whole office.\"<br />\nThough some staff reduction<br />\nbeyond the elimination of the<br />\nExecutive Assistant position may<br />\nbe necessary, a redistribution of<br />\nresponsibility among the office's<br />\npresent staff may take place as an<br />\nalternative economizing measure,<br />\nthe Dean emphasized.<br />\n\"I'm going to try to see which<br />\nway we can spread out people so<br />\nnot to hurt the quality of the<br />\nservices offered,\" he explained.<br />\n\"I will examine each position.\"<br />\nHall asserted that he will not<br />\nenact staff or service cutbacks<br />\nwhich would curtail services<br />\noffered by his office. \"I want to<br />\nsee how best to make the Dean<br /><br />\nBy MARC DUVOISIN<br />\nDean of Students Jakie Hall<br />\nwill examine his office's staff and<br />\nservice expenditures this summer<br />\nin an effort to \"see where things<br />\ncan be tightened up without<br />\nhurting the quality of student<br />\nservices.\"<br />\nFormer Dean of Students<br />\nRobert Fitzpatrick pledged last<br />\nsemester to re-evaluate the staff<br />\nresponsibilities in the Dean of<br />\nStudents Office with an eye<br />\n\u2022towards reducing the number of<br />\nstaff positions.<br />\nHall said yesterday that along<br />\nthis line he will \"look at the<br /><br />\nwhole Dean of Students<br />\noperation\" and try to \"tighten it<br />\nup wherever I can.\"<br />\nThe position of Executive<br />\nAssistant to the Dean of Students<br />\nwill be eliminated next year<br />\nwhen Barbara Roth, who<br />\npresently holds the post, leaves<br />\nHopkins for a similar position<br />\nelsewhere, Hall revealed.<br />\nHe said that the position of<br />\nAssistant to the Union Director,<br />\nwhich has been unfilled since<br />\nMitch Clarvit resigned in<br />\nFebruary, may also be abolished.<br />\nHowever, this move is \"only a<br />\npossibility,\" Hall said, and he will<br /><br />\npresident of World Federalists,<br />\nU.S.A.\u2014organizations working<br />\nfor world peace through world<br />\nlaw.

After being asked last week to select<br />\nthree topics fro'm a selected field without knowing who their<br />\nauthors were, all so that the Student Council Selections Committee could have the final say anyway, we're sure that the<br />\nrecently approved method is neither fair nor effective.<br />\nUnder the earlier system, undergraduates selected the topic<br />\nfrom a screened field. Now the Selections Committee screens<br />\nthe proposals before and after the voting, picking the winner<br />\nfrom among the top three vote-getters. As always, the names of<br />\nthose students submitting topics was withheld during last<br />\nweek's balloting.<br />\nWe object first of all to the fact that the Selections Committee exercises unilateral jurisdiction over the field of submissions<br />\nbefore and after the student body has had its say. The original<br />\npurpose of allowing the committee to review the proposals prior<br />\nto voting was to weed opt frivolous or unmanageable proposals.<br />\nNow, apparently, The Student Council feels that its Selections<br />\npanel must review the judgement of the undergraduate student<br />\nbody as well.<br />\nWe also take exception to the present tactic of withholding<br />\nthe names of the topics' authors. When students vote for a<br />\ntopic, they want to know who is going to supervise it if it is<br />\neventually selected. The present method forces students to vote<br />\nsomewhat blindly, equipped with only half of what, by right,<br />\nthey should know before making a selection. At present, evaluation of the proposals' sponsors is left up to the Selections Committee, a group of five SC reps. We propose that this forum be<br />\nexpanded somewhat\u2014like to include the entire student body.<br />\nFurthermore, we feel that the excessively bureaucratic format of the system\u2014committee, then to vote, then to committee<br />\nto choose from the top three\u2014will serve to discourage undergraduate interest in the Symposium selection. Student participation is, in fact minimal now, with the student body allowed to<br />\ngive a worthless approbation that is subject to the final ministrations of the almighty Selections Committee.<br />\nThough some politicking might result if the names were made<br />\npublic and the student body's vote made final, we feel that,<br />\nwith the Selections Committee still allowed to screen out frivolous submissions, open campaigning would be better than the<br />\ndisallowed sort that went on prior to last week's vote, disadvantaging those who chose to adhere to the committee's rules for<br />\nselection.<br />\nSince the Symposium is an important undergraduate function, undergraduates should play a larger\u2014or at least more real<br />\n\u2014part in determining who's going to run it.<br /><br />\n\u2022,,\u2022<br /><br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nWell, theFair done come and<br />\ngone. Despite a merciless , washout on Friday, the sunny skies of<br />\nSaturday &amp; Sunday sent thousands of people to Homewood4<br />\nto witness the increasingly legendary holiday at Hopkins.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nsilberner<br /><br />\nThis was a fair of surprises. Overnight the campus was<br />\ntransformed into a sprawling mass of<br />\ncrafts, oyster shells and lost children.<br />\nMusic was continuous, and was often performed simultaneously in front of the<br />\nGilman and Shriver quads. Mitch<br />\nClarvit returned - to the stage sounding<br />\nbetter than ever before, backed by, the<br />\nincredible local group, Northern Light.<br />\nStone Soup's natural food booth attracted scores ofpeople with its apricot bread<br />\nand egg rolls. Clowns were everywhere,<br />\ndancing on the lacrosse field, riding motorcycles and handing out balloons with<br />\nthe generosity of P.T. Barnum's rapscallions.<br />\nAnd so, once the rain quit, an air of<br />\necstatic frenzy overtook Homewood, the<br />\nglory of Hopkins shinin' through like burnin'coal.<br /><br />\ns<br /><br />\nThe Carlin hoax-only at Hopkms<br /><br />\nto a escria e what happened Sunday<br /><br />\nwhen, nearing the end of a long<br />\nand successful Spring Fair, a<br />\nslender, bearded Dundalk resident<br />\nmanaged to convince Alan Sapakie<br />\nand some members of the Fair<br />\nBoard that he was George Carlin<br />\nand that he was going to close out<br />\nthe festival with one of his<br />\nroutines\u2014gratis<br />\nIt was a wild end to a glorious<br />\nFair which seemed to get more and<br />\nmore out of control as the<br />\nfinale\u2014Ocean Rose, Rodeo Rick,<br />\nfireworks, and of course George<br />\nCarlin\u2014drew near. The campus was<br />\nliterally inundated with people all<br />\nweekend, but somehow there<br />\nseemed to be more of them<br />\nSunday afternoon\u2014more students,<br />\nmore members of the community,<br />\nand more than the usual quota of<br />\nHampden toughs.<br />\nAll afternoon Sapakie and his<br />\nsubordinates had been announcing<br />\nover the sound systems in front of<br />\nShriver and Gilman Halls that<br />\nGeorge Carlin was going to appear<br />\nin the freshman quad after the<br />\nfireworks\u2014for free. And so, as the<br />\nsun began to go down and exhibits<br />\nbegan to close up, people<br />\ngravitated towards Homewood<br />\nHouse, where Ocean Rose was<br />\ntuning up.<br />\nAfter Ocean Rose, one would<br />\nhear Rodeo Rick, then fireworks,<br />\nand then George Carlin.<br />\nBut something was terribly<br />\nwrong with Ocean Rose.<br /><br />\ncouldn't play their schedulecY set.<br /><br />\nSo then the crowd\u2014swiftly<br />\ngrowing into an amorphous<br />\nblob\u2014made its way over to the<br />\nmiddle of the freshman quad<br />\nwhere Rodeo Rick was getting<br />\nready for its set. Now,, with the<br />\nsun down, nothing but a beer<br />\nconcession open, and over a<br />\nthousand people gathered in front<br />\nof the dorm cafeteria, things<br />\nbecame surreal.<br />\nThe crowd, now a throng,<br />\npressed up against the bandstand,<br />\nblocking the speakers, making it<br />\nimpossible for the sound men to<br />\nget the mix down. And during this<br />\nconfusion, a slender, bearded<br />\nDundalk man was being plyed with<br />\nsandwiches and beer by a<br />\ntriumphant Alan Sapakie, who was<br />\nsure he'd just pulled the all-time<br />\nprogramming coup\u2014George Carlin<br />\nfor the finale, after the fireworks, a<br />\nsuperfinale, and for free to boot.<br />\nRodeo Rick, after some<br />\ndifficulty, began to play. But the<br />\ncrowd was still growing, spreading<br />\nthroughout the quad, unaware of<br />\nits own magnitude. Standing<br />\ninside, one was pressed from every<br />\ndirection, against the man behind<br />\nyou, nose-first into the chest of the<br />\nman in front of you.<br />\nSo tight was the squeeze that<br />\none narrowly avoided a fight with<br />\na man with a wooden leg who one<br />\nwas shoved flat up against.<br />\n\"Ease up, huh?\" was the<br />\nrequest.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor.<br />\nA man, purporting to be<br />\ncomedian George Carlin, came on<br />\ncampus Sunday morning and<br />\nintroduced himself to us as the<br />\nsame.

To show his<br />\ngratitude, he agreed to do a free<br />\nshow in the Freshman Quadrangle<br />\nafter the fireworks.<br />\nWe, the Fair Board, believed this<br />\nman for the following reasons:<br />\n1. He resembled George Carlin<br />\n(see the beard).<br />\n2. Ho sounded a lot like George<br />\nCarlin.<br />\n3. We wanted to believe he was<br />\nGeorge Carlin and would provide<br />\nan exciting finale to the Fair.<br />\n4. On Sunday we were all pretty<br />\nexhausted.<br />\nTo make a long story short, the<br /><br />\nguy was an imposter and the only<br />\nthing we had to laugh at was<br />\nourselves.<br />\nWe would like to point out that<br />\nwe didn't give the man a penny.<br />\nWe would also like to say that we<br />\nhad no intention of fooling<br />\nanyone.

From the<br />\nrear, all manner of Hampden<br />\nrabble were making slurred song<br />\nrequests. And from the side (his<br />\nleft side) a huge beast of a man was<br />\nholding a jug of moonshine and<br />\nmaking a specific and<br />\nunceremonious plea: \"Will you<br />\nassholes play `K.C. Jones.\"<br />\nBy this time, a slender, bearded<br />\ngentleman from Dundalk had<br />\nfinished the dinner bought for him<br />\nby the Fair Board and had made<br />\nhis way into the crowd to get high<br />\nand listen to the music before<br />\nappearing. Everybody was waiting<br />\nfor George Carlin.<br />\nThe music continued, and<br />\nRodeo Rick's smooth vocals had<br />\nplacated the throng to' some<br />\ndegree. Dancing, drinking, the<br />\ncrowd, like the savage it resembled,<br />\nwas appeased by song. But the<br />\nscene was still nothing less than<br />\nsurreal. To the left of the band, a<br />\nHopkins undergraduate was<br />\ndancing and guzzling beer from an<br /><br />\nthere appeared to him to be more<br />\nto drink as the veisel emptied,<br />\nsince the flask grew wider near its<br />\nbase.<br />\nAnd them' Steve Gasque<br />\nannounced that Rodeo Rick would<br />\nyield the stage to George Carlin,<br />\nwhereupon a slender, bearded<br />\nDundalk resident made his way up<br />\nto the microphone. Dressed like<br />\nGeorge Carlin, and looking a hell<br />\nof a lot like George Carlin, he sat<br />\ndown before the throng of<br />\nstudents and sweltering,<br />\nbeer-soaked Hampdenites.<br />\nWith one word out of his<br />\nmouth, Carlin devotees could tell<br />\nthey'd been hoaxed. Carlin has a<br />\nnon-descript, radio announcer's<br />\nvoice. The slender bearded<br />\ngentleman from Dundalk had a<br />\nBaltimore accent a mile thick...and<br />\nhe wasn't funny. After a few<br />\nminutes, ,the gig -was up. A few<br />\nfrom the crowd yelled \"fake,,\" but<br />\nthe throng, by and large, was dead<br />\nsilent and, one might imagine.<br />\nfairly pissed off.<br />\nThen the ersatz Carlin left, amid<br />\nscattered boos, and with over a<br />\nthousand stoned drunk students<br />\nand Hampdenites left unsatisfied,<br />\nwith nothing to do, there was no<br />\nmistaking the potential for real<br />\nviolence.

The win solidified the Jays<br />\nhold on the number one spo tin<br />\nthe USILA coaches poll and lifts<br />\ntheir overall season slate to 8-0.<br />\nAccording to coach Ciccarone<br />\nthere were three main reasons for<br />\nthe poor play on the part of the<br />\nHopkins stickmen. \"First, there<br />\nwas an obvious letdown after<br />\nCornell,\" noted the Blue Jay<br />\nmentor. \"Second, an incident<br />\noccurred after the Cornell game<br />\nin which Franz Wittelsberger,.<br />\nDon Kurz, and Jack Deckelbaum<br /><br />\nbroke a team rule and that<br />\nresulted in one-game suspensions<br />\nfor each of the players, and the<br />\nthird, and most important reason<br />\nis that Brown is a good team.\"<br />\nRanked seventh in the nation,<br />\nthe Bruins stormed , into<br />\nHomewood and outhustled the<br />\nBlue Jays, forcing Hopkins into<br />\nbad passes and beating the Jays<br />\nto ground balls all afternoon.<br />\n\"They showed fine stickwork<br />\nand forced us to play as poorly as<br />\nwe did,\" noted Ciccarone.<br />\nHopkins never trailed in the<br />\ngame but it was obvious that the<br />\nJays were struggling to keep their<br />\nheads above water.<br />\nGeorge Johnson, playing in<br />\nWittelsberger's spot, scored the<br />\nfirst two goals and Hopkins went<br /><br />\nrack team loses<br />\nvaluable member<br />\nDisappointment hit the track<br />\nteam this weekend as Oscar<br />\nSchreiber suffered an injury<br />\nwhich prematurely ended a fine<br />\ncollege track career. The<br />\ntri-captain was participating in<br />\nthe Delmarva Relays at Salisbury<br />\nwhen he pulled a muscle in the<br />\nlong jump event.<br />\nCoach Don Masken expressed<br />\ndeep regret at the loss in saying,<br />\n\"It's a shanie that this injury<br />\nhad to occur after he had<br />\nperformed so magnificently for<br />\nour team over a four year period.<br />\nIt is a great loss for our team.\"<br />\nThe muscle pull came after<br />\nSchreiber had been part of the<br />\nsprint medley team that finished<br />\nthird at Salisbury. The team<br />\nconsisted of Lon Massaglia, John<br />\nCoad, and Bob Alworth who ran<br />\nan 880\u2014yard time of 1:58.3,<br />\nalong with Schreiber. They ran<br />\nthe mile in 3:34.7. Mark<br />\nMcConnell took second place in<br />\nthe meet with a high jump that<br />\nmeasured 6-2.<br />\nThe team of Bob Alworth,<br />\nBob Oates, Craig Snyder and<br /><br />\nSchreiber also travelled to the<br />\nPenn Relays and took fourth in a<br />\nclose mile relay which saw four<br />\nteams finish with times of<br />\n3:24.4.<br />\nVictories<br />\nIn other action last week, the<br />\nHopkins team gained two<br />\nvictories over Loyola and<br />\nWestern Maryland to move their<br />\nrecord to 904. The meets were<br />\nheld as a double dual meet for<br />\nHopkins on the Homewood Field<br />\nas the Blue Jays won by scores of<br />\n90-45 and 87-58. The day was<br />\nhighlighted by Rick Nelson's pole<br />\nvault of 13-11<br />\n/<br />\n2 which broke the<br />\nschool record of 12-71/4 set in<br />\n1968.<br />\nOther fine performances were<br />\nturned in by Lon Massaglia in the<br />\n100-yard dash, Earl Dryer and<br />\nBob Oates in the 440, and Mark<br />\nMc Connell in the high jump and<br />\nhigh hurdles.<br />\nOther scorers were Jim<br />\nKennedy, John Veil, Mark<br />\nHylind, John Coad, and Oscar<br />\nSchreiber in the long and triple<br />\njumps.<br /><br />\nfrom there to a 4-2 lead after one<br />\nquarter and 7-4 after two.<br />\nBrown came out fired up after<br />\nintermission and shut out the<br />\nJays in the third quarter while<br />\nfiring in two goals themselves,<br />\ncutting the Hopkins lead to 7-6.<br /><br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br /><br />\nHogan to move all her players up<br />\na notch, further deflating the<br />\nteam's ability to win.<br />\nIn spite of all this, Coach<br />\nHogan was satisfied that the<br />\nwomen were able to keep<br />\nplaying. She was pleased that her<br />\nracketeers performed so well in<br />\nthe Maryland Association of<br />\nIntercollegiate Athletics for<br />\nWomen Tourney, finishing fourth<br />\nout of ten teams. The<br />\ntournament play gave the team<br />\nsome experience and exposure to<br />\ntop level competition.<br />\nThe team's best outing came at<br />\nthe expense of uptown rival<br />\nNotre Dame. After Sandy Ciciora<br />\nwas upended in the opening<br />\nsingles match, Susan Thomas,<br />\nLisa Kuhar, Gwen Pavlovitz, and<br />\nHeidi Hill outstroked NotreDame in straight sets in the rest<br />\nof the singles action. Hopkins'<br />\ntwo doubles teams of Lin<br />\nMurphy-Cathy Cramer and Linda<br />\nChi-Marlene Tandy swept their<br />\nchallengers in straight sets. The<br />\nfinal score was 6-1 in favor of the<br />\nJays.<br /><br />\ngame overtime win over Virginia,<br />\nthe Blue Jays rose to the<br />\noccasion, firing in four<br />\nconsecutive unanswered goals by<br />\nO'Neill, Kohler (2) and<br />\nZimmerman, breaking the tie and<br />\nsetting up the 13-10 triumph.<br /><br />\narts<br /><br />\nBaseball reverses losing trend<br />\nBy DAVID KRAUS<br />\nLed by the power-hitting of<br />\nDave Emala and the effective<br />\npitching of Billy Jones, the Blue<br />\nJay baseball team snapped a five<br />\ngame losing streak, downing the<br />\nTowson State Tigers 5-3<br />\nyesterday in a game played on<br />\nthe loser's field.<br />\nHopkins<br />\nEmala, the<br />\ncenterfielder, had a stellar<br />\nafternoon with the bat,<br />\ncontributing a pair of doubles<br />\nand a triple, while driving in four<br />\nruns and scoring the fifth.<br />\nJones hurled well in gaining<br />\nthe victory. He scattered nine<br />\nhits, while adding another<br />\ncomplete game to his record.<br /><br />\nFollowing two rather quiet<br />\ninnings, the men from<br />\nHomewood opened the scoring in<br />\nthe top of the third. Tom<br />\nPedroni singled and stole second.<br />\nLou Podrazik drew a walk to set<br />\nthe stage for Emala. The<br />\nfreshman drove a ball into<br />\nright-center for the first of his<br />\ntwo-baggers, scoring Pedroni and<br />\nPodrazik.<br />\nTowson State got back one<br />\nrun in the bottom of the fram on<br />\na single, a walk and anothei<br />\nsingle.<br />\nThe top of the fourth looked<br />\nlike a repeat of the previous<br />\ninning. With two outs, Pedroni<br />\nand Podrazik received walks to<br /><br />\ngive Emala another chance.<br />\nAgain the centerfielder<br />\nresponded. He smacked a ball<br />\ninto an almost identical spot in<br />\nright-center for the two-run<br />\ntriple.<br />\nThe next two innings,<br />\nalthough devoid of scoring, had<br />\nan abundance of excitement. The<br />\nTowson State cpach was thrown<br />\nout of the baLlgune while protesting<br />\na call at second base.<br />\nEmala continued his one-man<br />\nassault on the Tigers pitching in<br />\nthe seventh. He rapped his<br />\nsecond double to center,<br />\nadvanced to third on an errant<br />\npick-off attempt and scored on<br />\nBob Babb's sacrifice fly.<br /><br />\nAtqlete of t-ie Week<br /><br />\nDave Emala last of the heavies<br />\nBy DR.

Winning<br />\nwas not the key, as the team<br />\nfinished with a 1-5 record.<br />\nOne reason for Hopkins<br />\ndismal showing was their<br />\ninability to get in much practice<br />\ntime. Since their season is usually<br />\nin the fall, the women cannot<br />\nenjoy access to the courts since<br />\nthe men's tennis team reserves<br />\nexclusive rights to the facilities in<br />\nthe spring.
