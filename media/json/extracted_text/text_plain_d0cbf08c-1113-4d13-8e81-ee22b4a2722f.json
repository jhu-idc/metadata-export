Some of the things<br />\nthat Mr. Kistler told the men in<br />\nhis genial way made them wince<br />\nand hurt all the more because they<br />\nwere so patently true.<br />\n\"Athletics at Homewood are far<br />\ntoo slow for me\" was the manner<br />\nin which the diminutive instructor started out and before he had<br />\ngotten very far the old men in the<br />\nranks knew that they were listening to an epoch-making speech as<br />\nfar as the athletic future of the<br />\nUniversity was concerned. In his<br />\ntalk Mr. Kistler sketched briefly<br />\nthe history of sports at Homewood<br />\nand analyzed the athletic problem.<br />\nHe said that the greatest drawback that has always loomed up<br />\nhas been the fact that the men<br />\nhave never had a real opportunity<br />\nto know each other.<br />\nIn order to reach the solution.<br />\nof this problem he has hit upon<br />\na scheme of holding at least once a<br />\nmonth a battalion dance. But this<br />\nwas probably the most modest of<br />\nhis plans. He wants and is ready<br />\nto back to the last inch a friendly<br />\nspirit of athletic rivalry among<br />\nthe three companies of the battalion. He wants three football teams<br />\nrecruited from the ranks that will<br />\nstrive for the gridiorn championship of the battalion. He does not<br />\nstop here, however. When the inclement weather drives the football<br />\nmen to cover it is his purpose to<br />\norganize three basket-ball teams<br />\nfrom the companies to compete<br />\nfor the basket-ball championship.<br />\nIf his plans do not go amiss, the<br />\ncompanies will meet in swimming,<br />\nsoccer and baseball and at the<br />\nend of the year the company that<br />\nhas showed the greatest superiority in athletics will receive a<br />\nhandsome trophy. These plans<br />\nare great in themselves, but the<br />\nsignificance that they carry with<br />\nthem is more far-reaching than is<br />\nevident at first glance. When one<br />\nlooks back at the various squads<br />\nof former years and then compares them with the number of<br />\nmen that company rivalry is bound<br />\nto bring out for the five big sports,<br />\nit is not difftult to prophesy what<br />\nthis event will mean to future<br />\ntears at Homewood. There are<br />\nthirty men working each day to get<br />\na berth on the regular Black and<br />\nBlue football team and if Mr. Kistler's scheme does not go amiss<br />\nthere will be forty-five other men<br />\ndonning moleskins within the next<br />\nweek. Just what this will mean<br />\n<br />\nThe Universities of North Carolina and Virginia have agreed to<br />\nresume the triangular debate, the<br />\ndate of which will be announced<br />\nas soon as the arrangements, already under consideration, are<br />\ncomplete. The Debating Council<br />\nmet on Thursday, November 1,<br />\nand discussed the question of a<br />\nsubject for the debate. The Council<br />\nis anxious to select a subject that<br />\nwill be of immediate and vital interest to the public and to college<br />\nmen, and has under consideration<br />\nonly up-to-date and living questions the final decision will be<br />\nmade in the early part of this<br />\nweek.<br />\nTryouts for the senior and junior teams, which will debate the<br />\nsame question, will be held before<br />\nthe middle of this month. Men<br />\nwho try out for these teams have<br />\nan excellent chance to make the<br />\nintercollegiate team, and it is<br />\nhoped that a large number of men<br />\nwill avail themselves of this opportunity.<br />\nFor the first time in the history<br />\nof Hopkins debating, the Council<br />\nhas arranged a freshman-sophomore debate. The arrangements<br />\nfor this debate are being made by<br />\na committee made up of representatives of the two lower classes,<br />\nCharles Leber, of the Debating<br />\nCouncil, and Dr. French, debating<br />\nadviser. Tryouts will be held on<br />\nNovember 21, and the debate will<br />\ntake place on January 5. Great<br />\ninterest has been manifested by<br />\nboth classes.<br />\nto the teams that are to fight for<br />\nHopkins in the years to come is<br />\nalmost inestimatable.<br />\nIn addition to the unfolding of<br />\nthese plans, Mr. Kistler made a<br />\nplea to the men to get behind the<br />\nefforts of the enthusiasts that are<br />\nworking every minute to make<br />\nswimming and basket-ball recognized sports at the University.<br />\nThe more sports we have the more<br />\nmen will be benefited was the way<br />\nthat Mr. Kistler expressed it and<br />\nfrom the applause that his remarks drew from the olive drab<br />\nranks there is little doubt as to<br />\nthe ultimate success of his plans.<br />\nAfter Mr. Kistler withdrew, Major Guild took the floor and pointed out the various advantages of<br />\nclean company rivalry. He said<br />\nthat if a trophy can be given for<br />\nathletic supremacy among the<br />\ncompanies one should be given for<br />\nmilitary excellence. He further<br />\nremarked that there was no man<br />\nmore interested in the welfare of<br />\nthe battalion than he, and that<br />\nwhen the time comes to measure up the respective abilities of<br />\nthe different companies he can<br />\npromise that there will be a<br />\ntrophy for the winning company.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 5, 1917.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\nJe t1011113 NOilii1113 NOW3-[01101<br />\n8<br />\nFOUNDED. 1<br />\n<br />\nSubscription<br />\n<br />\n$2.00<br />\n<br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nBaltimore, Md., under Act of Congress,<br />\nNovember 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished weekly, from October to<br />\nJune, by the students of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles and other communications should be<br />\nsent to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone<br />\n<br />\nHomewood 100<br />\n<br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nMitchell B.

As great oaks from little acorns grow, so must the Hopkins spirit now fostered by but a<br />\nfew loyal men be nurtured and fed<br />\nuntil some day it will break forth<br />\nin devoted enthusiasm for our<br />\nAlma Mater, a something indefinable, intangible, yet vitally necessary in college life.<br />\nLast week two live-wire men told<br />\nus what they thought of our spirit,<br />\nand the way we support the institution. They endeavored to stimulate our enthusiasm, to kindle in<br />\nour breasts an unquenchable spark<br />\nof devotion to Hopkins\u2014the kind<br />\nof devotion that rejoices in selfsacrifice. They tried, and will continue to try, to lead us from our<br />\nseparate spheres of interest to one<br />\nworld\u2014the Hopkins world. They<br />\nwant to mould us into a student<br />\nbody with one mind, one ideal, one<br />\nspirit. Let no one think, however,<br />\nthat in building up unity, they<br />\nwant to tear down individualism.<br />\nAbove all things they want the individual to stand out distinct on<br />\nthe University horizon, but they<br />\nwant him to submerge his selfish<br />\ninterests in the common weal of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nThe commandant of the battalion and the assistant physical director want every member of the<br />\nUniversity to be a little less conscious of self and a little more<br />\nconscious of the other fellow and<br />\nthe college. They intend to build<br />\nup the Hopkins spirit, by first<br />\nnurturing it in the company, then<br />\nthe battalion, then the University.<br />\n<br />\nThey are trying to knit the men<br />\ncloser together, and stir up a spirit<br />\n\u2022 of pride in the company, the battalion, the University, and a spirit<br />\nof keen but friendly rivalry between its parts. They are introducing contests in athletics between companies and offering trophies. They want *the men to be<br />\ngood sports as well as drillers.<br />\nWhen good sportsmanship is<br />\nevolved, the men will learn how to<br />\nsacrifice petty things for the good<br />\nof the battalion and University.<br />\nThe constant competition will<br />\nstimulate always the desire to excel. And when this spirit of selfsacrifice is blended with the one<br />\ndesire to 'excel, then will we have<br />\na crack battalion, a live student<br />\norganism, in which every part is<br />\nloyally and whole-heartedly supported and in which every member<br />\nis striving for the good of Hopkins.<br />\nWake Up, Upper classmen!<br />\n<br />\nThe sophomores may be regarded rather lightly by the upper<br />\nclassmen, but it is admitted that<br />\nthey put the juniors and seniors<br />\nto shame with their leading spirit<br />\nand attendance at the mass-meeting last Friday. If the upper<br />\nclassmen wish to assert their<br />\nrights, now is the time. It is<br />\nhardly traditional for the sophomores to set an example for their<br />\nelders to follow.<br />\nBeat Western Maryland.<br />\n<br />\nWe have got to beat Western<br />\nMaryland. The time for pussyfooting and slacking has come to<br />\nan end, and every Hopkins man<br />\nhas got to show his colors.

Evans, lieutenant in the<br />\nU. S. light field artillery in<br />\nFrance, who before receiving his<br />\ncommission served in the Convois<br />\nAutomobiles, driving an ammunition truck. The scenes he portrays<br />\nare full of color, and are typical of<br />\nthe brighter side of war life. More<br />\nletters from Evans will appear in<br />\nthe future, permission having been<br />\nobtained from his parents to publish them. The letter is as follows:<br />\nCON'VOIS AUTOMOBILES, PARIS.<br />\nJuly 19, 1917.<br />\nDEAR FATHER:<br />\nWe have been fairly busy lately,<br />\nalthough everyone grumbles about<br />\nthe lack of excitement. We get<br />\na German shell once in a while\u2014<br />\none landed about fifty feet from<br />\nme the other night, but that is<br />\nnothing compared to the dangers<br />\nof the real fighting. We all feel<br />\nthat this is slackers work. The<br />\nUnited States papers seem to regard the ambulance and transport<br />\ndivisions as slackers' jobs. They<br />\nare, but none of us came into this<br />\nwith the idea of getting out of<br />\ndanger and hard work we came<br />\nto get into it all the quicker. Most<br />\nof the fellows realize that this is<br />\ntoo easy a job for able-bodied men<br />\nand are going into something better. After seeing all the aeroplanes over here, we have all gone<br />\ncrazy about aviation. I would<br />\nlike to come back and go into the<br />\nU. S. aviation service, if I thought<br />\nI could get into it. Aviation will<br />\nwin the war yet.<br />\nWe had a great time on the<br />\nFourth of July. There was a parade in -the morning and three<br />\nFrenchmen were presented with<br />\n\"Croix de Guerre\" medals. Then<br />\nwe had all kinds of games, both<br />\nFrench and American, that last<br />\nmost all day. Algerian bands<br />\nwere here and they gave a concert<br />\nof their African and Arab music.<br />\nThen they did the crazy Arab and<br />\nMoroccan dances with swords and<br />\nrifles. It was hard to realize that<br />\nthe scene was in France, to see all<br />\nthe (lark Africans, some in turbans and others in red fezzes. The<br />\n(lay ended with fencing matches<br />\nbetween the French officers, and<br />\nthen a banquet.<br />\nI have had almost every kind of<br />\ninjection that they give now. I<br />\nhad typhoid and paratyphoid before I left, and the other day they<br />\ngave me anti-tetanus serum to prevent lockjaw. I was in a collision<br />\nseveral nights ago in the dark and<br />\ngot a small cut on my knee, so<br />\nthey shot me full of anti-tetanus<br />\nserum. They do that over here if<br />\nyou get cut at all, because there<br />\nis great danger of blood poison,<br />\netc.<br />\nI have just received your letters<br />\nof the 29th of June and the 26th<br />\nof June.<br />\n<br />\nFOOBALL REVIEW<br />\nBy COACH BRENNICK<br />\nThe game with Swarthmore on<br />\nSaturday brought to a close the<br />\nfirst phase of this year's football<br />\nseason. During this period, with<br />\none exception, admitedly superior<br />\nteams were met, and since we have<br />\nbeen less formidable than usual because of war conditions the results<br />\nin so far as victories are concerned<br />\nhave not been altogther pleasing.<br />\nFrom the aspect of pure sport,<br />\nhowever, the results have been<br />\nmost gratifying, for we have gotten together a group of men preponderatingly undergraduate who<br />\nplay with a spirit and pluck that<br />\nhas won admiration. The game<br />\nSaturday was a fair exhibition of<br />\nthe physical capabilities of the<br />\nteam when pitted against as heavy<br />\nand as skillful a team as Swarthmore, but it was not a fair showing of the team's mental ability,<br />\nfor in this regard it was somewhat<br />\noff form. The team has not yet<br />\nlearned, when working under the<br />\npressure and stress of a game, how<br />\nto bring into execution the knowledge of the game it possesses. This<br />\nsimply illustrates the often overlooked fact that there is a wide<br />\ngulf between knowing how to do a<br />\nthing and being able to do a thing.<br />\nDevelopment in this direction has<br />\nbeen retarded by the experimenting in the quarterback position,<br />\nbut Winslow has now demonstrated that he is capable of filling that<br />\nplace in such a manner as to gain<br />\nthe confidence of the team, a state<br />\nbut just arrived at since Purcell's<br />\ninjury.<br />\nThe second phase of the season<br />\nbegins this week and the first vital<br />\ntest of the eleven against an opponent of equal strength takes<br />\npalce when we meet Western<br />\nMaryland Saturday next. This<br />\nteam will come to Homewood with<br />\nits usual unbounded faith and confidence in its own ability backed<br />\nby exceptional skill on the part of<br />\nthree or four players, so that if<br />\nwe are to win we must be at the<br />\ntop of our game and we must eradicate some glaring defects.<br />\nOur line at present is far ahead<br />\nof the backfield, both on offence<br />\nand defense, for the backfield thus<br />\nfar failed to co-ordinate with the<br />\nline. On offence, the backfield,<br />\nexcept in spurts, has not shown<br />\nenough speed to take advantage<br />\nof the work of the line, while on<br />\ndefense it has allowed plays which<br />\nhave been checked by the forwards<br />\nor which have been stripped of<br />\ntheir interference, to develop from<br />\nlosses into gains. Unless this error is corrected, victory is out of<br />\nthe question. Our kicking game<br />\nmust be improved also, for as it is<br />\nnow, we are placed in jeopardy<br />\nevery time we kick. It is needless<br />\nfor us, we trust, to state that stern<br />\nendeavors will be made to wipe out<br />\nthese deficiencies.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 5, 1917.<br />\n<br />\nAMUSEMENTS<br />\n<br />\n\u2014<br />\n<br />\nACADEMY<br />\n\u2022 Nights at 8.15.<br />\nPrices, 25c to $2<br />\nSat.

I first met him<br />\nin Berlin in the spring of 1887. He<br />\nHad just completed residence at<br />\nthe University of Munich, where<br />\nhe had won a doctor's degree. He<br />\nhad just been asked by Prof.<br />\nGeorge Williams then professor<br />\nof geology at Johns Hopkins University, to come to Baltimore as<br />\ninstructor in geology; and he was<br />\ntherefore deeply interested in<br />\nlearning all he could about the<br />\nUniversity, its spirit, its men and<br />\nthe opportunities for work. I<br />\nwet him in Baltimore in the fall of<br />\nthat year, and I remember well our<br />\npleasant evenings together in his<br />\nrooms on Howard street, in the<br />\noil University building which had<br />\nseen the construction of Rowland's<br />\nfirst engine and first concave grating spectroscope, and which was<br />\ntorn down long ago to make room<br />\nfor the present cage attached to<br />\nthe gymnasium.<br />\n\"The spirit he manifested in<br />\nthat, his first, year, his attitude<br />\ntowards his work and towards the<br />\nideals of the University, his sympathy with the University with the\u2022<br />\nbeing of the city and State, were<br />\nas marked then as on the last day<br />\nof his life \u2022 they never changed.<br />\nThe controlling principle in his<br />\nlife towards the University was<br />\na firm realization of its duty to<br />\nfoster and encourage individual<br />\nendeavors in all forms of research<br />\nand investigation. He inspired in<br />\nhis colleagues and students a feeling of devotion to the purely scientific side of geology, as distinct<br />\nfrom that which may be called<br />\nits commercial side.\"<br />\nDr. Ames' concluding words<br />\nwere:\"To him geology, and in fact<br />\nall sciences, were interesting, first<br />\nbecause their study contributed to<br />\nknowledge; but what was equally<br />\nimportant to him was the fact<br />\nthat they also helped human endeavor. This recognition of the<br />\ntwo-fold aspect of scientific work,<br />\nin fact of all the activities of a<br />\nuniversity, is not a common quality in the minds of most people;<br />\nthe balance is not held so even.\"<br />\nDr. Charles D. Wolcott, who before becoming secretary of the<br />\nSmithsonian Institution was director of the Geological Survey,<br />\ntold of Dr. Clarke's achievements<br />\nas a geologist. \"To estimate Dr.<br />\nClarke's achievements,\" he said,<br />\n\"we must consider the field of his<br />\nspecial work in the State of Maryland, where he began his activities<br />\nin.1888 and in 1896 organized the<br />\nState Geological Survey, and<br />\nagain twenty-one years later when<br />\nhis participation in the work was<br />\nsuddenly brought to a close<br />\nthrough the tremendous strain<br />\nthrown on him by the war demands of his State and nation or<br />\nthe organization on a war footing<br />\nof geological information of military value.<br />\n\"In 1888 Dr. Clarke began a detailed study of the cretaceous and<br />\ntertiary formations of the Atlantic Costal Plain. So well did he<br />\n<br />\ndo his work that he became ge:<br />\nologist in the U. S. Geological<br />\nSurvey in 1894 and State Geologist in 1896. From the moment<br />\nhe became State Geologist, Maryland began to grow steadily in the<br />\ngeological scale and soon ranked<br />\nwith Pennsylvania and New York<br />\nas one of the progressive states of<br />\nthe Atlantic province. As a member of the U. S. Geological Survey<br />\nfrom 1888 to 1907, and as cooperating geologist during the<br />\npast ten years, he contributed to<br />\nthe efficiency of that great national organization and always<br />\nheld himself ready to render public service.\"<br />\nJudge Williams spoke on Professor Clarke's relations to the State<br />\nand its people. \"No man has contributed more to the welfare and<br />\nwealth of Maryland,\" he said.<br />\n\"Dr. Clarke opened the eyes of the<br />\npeople of Maryland to its resources. It was remarkable that<br />\nhe, a theorist, could impress his<br />\nviews on the practical interest in<br />\nother things than geology. Dr.<br />\nClarke had interest in other things<br />\nthan geology. In 1893 he had a<br />\nbill put through to improve the<br />\nState highway, and for this he has<br />\nnever received due credit. Since<br />\n1901 Professor Clarke has been<br />\npresident of the Henry Watson<br />\nChildren's Aid Society, and was<br />\na delegate to the White House Conference called by President Roosevelt in 1909 to consider the subject of the dependent child. He<br />\nwas also a member of the executive<br />\ncommittee of the State Tuberculosis Association and a vice-president and)chairman of the executive committee of the Federated<br />\nCharities of Baltimore.\"<br />\nIn closing, Judge Williams gave<br />\na quotation which he felt expressed<br />\ninfinitely well the character of<br />\nProfessor Clarke: \"With all the<br />\naccomplishments of a gentleman,<br />\nhe combined the virtues of a martry, and the piety of a Christian.\"<br />\n\"Dr. Clarke laid deep and strong<br />\nfoundations for the scientific and<br />\neconomic survey of Maryland for<br />\ngenerations to come.

He wants three football teams<br />\nrecruited from the ranks that will<br />\nstrive for the gridiorn championship of the battalion. He does not<br />\nstop here, however. When the inclement weather drives the football<br />\nmen to cover it is his purpose to<br />\norganize three basket-ball teams<br />\nfrom the companies to compete<br />\nfor the basket-ball championship.<br />\nIf his plans do not go amiss, the<br />\ncompanies will meet in swimming,<br />\nsoccer and baseball and at the<br />\nend of the year the company that<br />\nhas showed the greatest superiority in athletics will receive a<br />\nhandsome trophy. These plans<br />\nare great in themselves, but the<br />\nsignificance that they carry with<br />\nthem is more far-reaching than is<br />\nevident at first glance. When one<br />\nlooks back at the various squads<br />\nof former years and then compares them with the number of<br />\nmen that company rivalry is bound<br />\nto bring out for the five big sports,<br />\nit is not difftult to prophesy what<br />\nthis event will mean to future<br />\ntears at Homewood. There are<br />\nthirty men working each day to get<br />\na berth on the regular Black and<br />\nBlue football team and if Mr. Kistler's scheme does not go amiss<br />\nthere will be forty-five other men<br />\ndonning moleskins within the next<br />\nweek. Just what this will mean<br /><br />\nThe Universities of North Carolina and Virginia have agreed to<br />\nresume the triangular debate, the<br />\ndate of which will be announced<br />\nas soon as the arrangements, already under consideration, are<br />\ncomplete. The Debating Council<br />\nmet on Thursday, November 1,<br />\nand discussed the question of a<br />\nsubject for the debate. The Council<br />\nis anxious to select a subject that<br />\nwill be of immediate and vital interest to the public and to college<br />\nmen, and has under consideration<br />\nonly up-to-date and living questions the final decision will be<br />\nmade in the early part of this<br />\nweek.<br />\nTryouts for the senior and junior teams, which will debate the<br />\nsame question, will be held before<br />\nthe middle of this month. Men<br />\nwho try out for these teams have<br />\nan excellent chance to make the<br />\nintercollegiate team, and it is<br />\nhoped that a large number of men<br />\nwill avail themselves of this opportunity.<br />\nFor the first time in the history<br />\nof Hopkins debating, the Council<br />\nhas arranged a freshman-sophomore debate. The arrangements<br />\nfor this debate are being made by<br />\na committee made up of representatives of the two lower classes,<br />\nCharles Leber, of the Debating<br />\nCouncil, and Dr. French, debating<br />\nadviser. Tryouts will be held on<br />\nNovember 21, and the debate will<br />\ntake place on January 5. Great<br />\ninterest has been manifested by<br />\nboth classes.<br />\nto the teams that are to fight for<br />\nHopkins in the years to come is<br />\nalmost inestimatable.<br />\nIn addition to the unfolding of<br />\nthese plans, Mr. Kistler made a<br />\nplea to the men to get behind the<br />\nefforts of the enthusiasts that are<br />\nworking every minute to make<br />\nswimming and basket-ball recognized sports at the University.<br />\nThe more sports we have the more<br />\nmen will be benefited was the way<br />\nthat Mr. Kistler expressed it and<br />\nfrom the applause that his remarks drew from the olive drab<br />\nranks there is little doubt as to<br />\nthe ultimate success of his plans.<br />\nAfter Mr. Kistler withdrew, Major Guild took the floor and pointed out the various advantages of<br />\nclean company rivalry. He said<br />\nthat if a trophy can be given for<br />\nathletic supremacy among the<br />\ncompanies one should be given for<br />\nmilitary excellence. He further<br />\nremarked that there was no man<br />\nmore interested in the welfare of<br />\nthe battalion than he, and that<br />\nwhen the time comes to measure up the respective abilities of<br />\nthe different companies he can<br />\npromise that there will be a<br />\ntrophy for the winning company.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 5, 1917.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nJe t1011113 NOilii1113 NOW3-[01101<br />\n8<br />\nFOUNDED. 1<br /><br />\nSubscription<br /><br />\n$2.00<br /><br />\nEntered as second-class matter December 3, 1909, at the Post Office at<br />\nBaltimore, Md., under Act of Congress,<br />\nNovember 3, 1879.<br />\nPublished weekly, from October to<br />\nJune, by the students of the Johns<br />\nHopkins University.<br />\nBusiness communications should be<br />\naddressed to the BUSINESS MANAGER,<br />\nJOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY; all articles and other communications should be<br />\nsent to the EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.<br />\nTelephone<br /><br />\nHomewood 100<br /><br />\nEditor-in-Chief:<br />\nMitchell B.

As great oaks from little acorns grow, so must the Hopkins spirit now fostered by but a<br />\nfew loyal men be nurtured and fed<br />\nuntil some day it will break forth<br />\nin devoted enthusiasm for our<br />\nAlma Mater, a something indefinable, intangible, yet vitally necessary in college life.<br />\nLast week two live-wire men told<br />\nus what they thought of our spirit,<br />\nand the way we support the institution. They endeavored to stimulate our enthusiasm, to kindle in<br />\nour breasts an unquenchable spark<br />\nof devotion to Hopkins\u2014the kind<br />\nof devotion that rejoices in selfsacrifice. They tried, and will continue to try, to lead us from our<br />\nseparate spheres of interest to one<br />\nworld\u2014the Hopkins world. They<br />\nwant to mould us into a student<br />\nbody with one mind, one ideal, one<br />\nspirit. Let no one think, however,<br />\nthat in building up unity, they<br />\nwant to tear down individualism.<br />\nAbove all things they want the individual to stand out distinct on<br />\nthe University horizon, but they<br />\nwant him to submerge his selfish<br />\ninterests in the common weal of<br />\nJohns Hopkins.<br />\nThe commandant of the battalion and the assistant physical director want every member of the<br />\nUniversity to be a little less conscious of self and a little more<br />\nconscious of the other fellow and<br />\nthe college. They intend to build<br />\nup the Hopkins spirit, by first<br />\nnurturing it in the company, then<br />\nthe battalion, then the University.<br /><br />\nThey are trying to knit the men<br />\ncloser together, and stir up a spirit<br />\n\u2022 of pride in the company, the battalion, the University, and a spirit<br />\nof keen but friendly rivalry between its parts. They are introducing contests in athletics between companies and offering trophies. They want *the men to be<br />\ngood sports as well as drillers.<br />\nWhen good sportsmanship is<br />\nevolved, the men will learn how to<br />\nsacrifice petty things for the good<br />\nof the battalion and University.<br />\nThe constant competition will<br />\nstimulate always the desire to excel. And when this spirit of selfsacrifice is blended with the one<br />\ndesire to 'excel, then will we have<br />\na crack battalion, a live student<br />\norganism, in which every part is<br />\nloyally and whole-heartedly supported and in which every member<br />\nis striving for the good of Hopkins.<br />\nWake Up, Upper classmen!<br /><br />\nThe sophomores may be regarded rather lightly by the upper<br />\nclassmen, but it is admitted that<br />\nthey put the juniors and seniors<br />\nto shame with their leading spirit<br />\nand attendance at the mass-meeting last Friday. If the upper<br />\nclassmen wish to assert their<br />\nrights, now is the time. It is<br />\nhardly traditional for the sophomores to set an example for their<br />\nelders to follow.<br />\nBeat Western Maryland.<br /><br />\nWe have got to beat Western<br />\nMaryland. The time for pussyfooting and slacking has come to<br />\nan end, and every Hopkins man<br />\nhas got to show his colors.

All this week and<br />\nat Friday's mass-meeting we have<br />\ngot to stir up such a burst of enthusiasm that the visiting team<br />\nwill be swept off the field. When<br />\nthe first whistle blows that march<br />\nfrom. Gilman Hall to Homewood<br />\nField has got to be a march of<br />\ncoming victory.<br />\nThe team and students now lack<br />\npunch.

We can get it if we start<br />\nfighting for it now. Beat Western<br />\nMaryland!<br />\nPrinceton's Glee Club this year<br />\nwill be organized on a different<br />\nbasis than ever before. Instead<br />\nof the usual Easter trip, the purpose of the club this year will be<br />\nto provide entertainment for the<br />\nsoldiers at the various national<br />\nencampments.

Evans, lieutenant in the<br />\nU. S. light field artillery in<br />\nFrance, who before receiving his<br />\ncommission served in the Convois<br />\nAutomobiles, driving an ammunition truck. The scenes he portrays<br />\nare full of color, and are typical of<br />\nthe brighter side of war life. More<br />\nletters from Evans will appear in<br />\nthe future, permission having been<br />\nobtained from his parents to publish them. The letter is as follows:<br />\nCON'VOIS AUTOMOBILES, PARIS.<br />\nJuly 19, 1917.<br />\nDEAR FATHER:<br />\nWe have been fairly busy lately,<br />\nalthough everyone grumbles about<br />\nthe lack of excitement. We get<br />\na German shell once in a while\u2014<br />\none landed about fifty feet from<br />\nme the other night, but that is<br />\nnothing compared to the dangers<br />\nof the real fighting. We all feel<br />\nthat this is slackers work. The<br />\nUnited States papers seem to regard the ambulance and transport<br />\ndivisions as slackers' jobs. They<br />\nare, but none of us came into this<br />\nwith the idea of getting out of<br />\ndanger and hard work we came<br />\nto get into it all the quicker. Most<br />\nof the fellows realize that this is<br />\ntoo easy a job for able-bodied men<br />\nand are going into something better. After seeing all the aeroplanes over here, we have all gone<br />\ncrazy about aviation. I would<br />\nlike to come back and go into the<br />\nU. S. aviation service, if I thought<br />\nI could get into it. Aviation will<br />\nwin the war yet.<br />\nWe had a great time on the<br />\nFourth of July. There was a parade in -the morning and three<br />\nFrenchmen were presented with<br />\n\"Croix de Guerre\" medals. Then<br />\nwe had all kinds of games, both<br />\nFrench and American, that last<br />\nmost all day. Algerian bands<br />\nwere here and they gave a concert<br />\nof their African and Arab music.<br />\nThen they did the crazy Arab and<br />\nMoroccan dances with swords and<br />\nrifles. It was hard to realize that<br />\nthe scene was in France, to see all<br />\nthe (lark Africans, some in turbans and others in red fezzes. The<br />\n(lay ended with fencing matches<br />\nbetween the French officers, and<br />\nthen a banquet.<br />\nI have had almost every kind of<br />\ninjection that they give now. I<br />\nhad typhoid and paratyphoid before I left, and the other day they<br />\ngave me anti-tetanus serum to prevent lockjaw. I was in a collision<br />\nseveral nights ago in the dark and<br />\ngot a small cut on my knee, so<br />\nthey shot me full of anti-tetanus<br />\nserum. They do that over here if<br />\nyou get cut at all, because there<br />\nis great danger of blood poison,<br />\netc.<br />\nI have just received your letters<br />\nof the 29th of June and the 26th<br />\nof June.<br /><br />\nFOOBALL REVIEW<br />\nBy COACH BRENNICK<br />\nThe game with Swarthmore on<br />\nSaturday brought to a close the<br />\nfirst phase of this year's football<br />\nseason. During this period, with<br />\none exception, admitedly superior<br />\nteams were met, and since we have<br />\nbeen less formidable than usual because of war conditions the results<br />\nin so far as victories are concerned<br />\nhave not been altogther pleasing.<br />\nFrom the aspect of pure sport,<br />\nhowever, the results have been<br />\nmost gratifying, for we have gotten together a group of men preponderatingly undergraduate who<br />\nplay with a spirit and pluck that<br />\nhas won admiration. The game<br />\nSaturday was a fair exhibition of<br />\nthe physical capabilities of the<br />\nteam when pitted against as heavy<br />\nand as skillful a team as Swarthmore, but it was not a fair showing of the team's mental ability,<br />\nfor in this regard it was somewhat<br />\noff form. The team has not yet<br />\nlearned, when working under the<br />\npressure and stress of a game, how<br />\nto bring into execution the knowledge of the game it possesses. This<br />\nsimply illustrates the often overlooked fact that there is a wide<br />\ngulf between knowing how to do a<br />\nthing and being able to do a thing.<br />\nDevelopment in this direction has<br />\nbeen retarded by the experimenting in the quarterback position,<br />\nbut Winslow has now demonstrated that he is capable of filling that<br />\nplace in such a manner as to gain<br />\nthe confidence of the team, a state<br />\nbut just arrived at since Purcell's<br />\ninjury.<br />\nThe second phase of the season<br />\nbegins this week and the first vital<br />\ntest of the eleven against an opponent of equal strength takes<br />\npalce when we meet Western<br />\nMaryland Saturday next. This<br />\nteam will come to Homewood with<br />\nits usual unbounded faith and confidence in its own ability backed<br />\nby exceptional skill on the part of<br />\nthree or four players, so that if<br />\nwe are to win we must be at the<br />\ntop of our game and we must eradicate some glaring defects.<br />\nOur line at present is far ahead<br />\nof the backfield, both on offence<br />\nand defense, for the backfield thus<br />\nfar failed to co-ordinate with the<br />\nline. On offence, the backfield,<br />\nexcept in spurts, has not shown<br />\nenough speed to take advantage<br />\nof the work of the line, while on<br />\ndefense it has allowed plays which<br />\nhave been checked by the forwards<br />\nor which have been stripped of<br />\ntheir interference, to develop from<br />\nlosses into gains. Unless this error is corrected, victory is out of<br />\nthe question. Our kicking game<br />\nmust be improved also, for as it is<br />\nnow, we are placed in jeopardy<br />\nevery time we kick. It is needless<br />\nfor us, we trust, to state that stern<br />\nendeavors will be made to wipe out<br />\nthese deficiencies.<br /><br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS\u2014LETTER, NOVEMBER 5, 1917.<br /><br />\nAMUSEMENTS<br /><br />\n\u2014<br /><br />\nACADEMY<br />\n\u2022 Nights at 8.15.<br />\nPrices, 25c to $2<br />\nSat.

I first met him<br />\nin Berlin in the spring of 1887. He<br />\nHad just completed residence at<br />\nthe University of Munich, where<br />\nhe had won a doctor's degree. He<br />\nhad just been asked by Prof.<br />\nGeorge Williams then professor<br />\nof geology at Johns Hopkins University, to come to Baltimore as<br />\ninstructor in geology; and he was<br />\ntherefore deeply interested in<br />\nlearning all he could about the<br />\nUniversity, its spirit, its men and<br />\nthe opportunities for work. I<br />\nwet him in Baltimore in the fall of<br />\nthat year, and I remember well our<br />\npleasant evenings together in his<br />\nrooms on Howard street, in the<br />\noil University building which had<br />\nseen the construction of Rowland's<br />\nfirst engine and first concave grating spectroscope, and which was<br />\ntorn down long ago to make room<br />\nfor the present cage attached to<br />\nthe gymnasium.<br />\n\"The spirit he manifested in<br />\nthat, his first, year, his attitude<br />\ntowards his work and towards the<br />\nideals of the University, his sympathy with the University with the\u2022<br />\nbeing of the city and State, were<br />\nas marked then as on the last day<br />\nof his life \u2022 they never changed.<br />\nThe controlling principle in his<br />\nlife towards the University was<br />\na firm realization of its duty to<br />\nfoster and encourage individual<br />\nendeavors in all forms of research<br />\nand investigation. He inspired in<br />\nhis colleagues and students a feeling of devotion to the purely scientific side of geology, as distinct<br />\nfrom that which may be called<br />\nits commercial side.\"<br />\nDr. Ames' concluding words<br />\nwere:\"To him geology, and in fact<br />\nall sciences, were interesting, first<br />\nbecause their study contributed to<br />\nknowledge; but what was equally<br />\nimportant to him was the fact<br />\nthat they also helped human endeavor. This recognition of the<br />\ntwo-fold aspect of scientific work,<br />\nin fact of all the activities of a<br />\nuniversity, is not a common quality in the minds of most people;<br />\nthe balance is not held so even.\"<br />\nDr. Charles D. Wolcott, who before becoming secretary of the<br />\nSmithsonian Institution was director of the Geological Survey,<br />\ntold of Dr. Clarke's achievements<br />\nas a geologist. \"To estimate Dr.<br />\nClarke's achievements,\" he said,<br />\n\"we must consider the field of his<br />\nspecial work in the State of Maryland, where he began his activities<br />\nin.1888 and in 1896 organized the<br />\nState Geological Survey, and<br />\nagain twenty-one years later when<br />\nhis participation in the work was<br />\nsuddenly brought to a close<br />\nthrough the tremendous strain<br />\nthrown on him by the war demands of his State and nation or<br />\nthe organization on a war footing<br />\nof geological information of military value.<br />\n\"In 1888 Dr. Clarke began a detailed study of the cretaceous and<br />\ntertiary formations of the Atlantic Costal Plain. So well did he<br /><br />\ndo his work that he became ge:<br />\nologist in the U. S. Geological<br />\nSurvey in 1894 and State Geologist in 1896. From the moment<br />\nhe became State Geologist, Maryland began to grow steadily in the<br />\ngeological scale and soon ranked<br />\nwith Pennsylvania and New York<br />\nas one of the progressive states of<br />\nthe Atlantic province. As a member of the U. S. Geological Survey<br />\nfrom 1888 to 1907, and as cooperating geologist during the<br />\npast ten years, he contributed to<br />\nthe efficiency of that great national organization and always<br />\nheld himself ready to render public service.\"<br />\nJudge Williams spoke on Professor Clarke's relations to the State<br />\nand its people. \"No man has contributed more to the welfare and<br />\nwealth of Maryland,\" he said.<br />\n\"Dr. Clarke opened the eyes of the<br />\npeople of Maryland to its resources. It was remarkable that<br />\nhe, a theorist, could impress his<br />\nviews on the practical interest in<br />\nother things than geology. Dr.<br />\nClarke had interest in other things<br />\nthan geology. In 1893 he had a<br />\nbill put through to improve the<br />\nState highway, and for this he has<br />\nnever received due credit. Since<br />\n1901 Professor Clarke has been<br />\npresident of the Henry Watson<br />\nChildren's Aid Society, and was<br />\na delegate to the White House Conference called by President Roosevelt in 1909 to consider the subject of the dependent child. He<br />\nwas also a member of the executive<br />\ncommittee of the State Tuberculosis Association and a vice-president and)chairman of the executive committee of the Federated<br />\nCharities of Baltimore.\"<br />\nIn closing, Judge Williams gave<br />\na quotation which he felt expressed<br />\ninfinitely well the character of<br />\nProfessor Clarke: \"With all the<br />\naccomplishments of a gentleman,<br />\nhe combined the virtues of a martry, and the piety of a Christian.\"<br />\n\"Dr. Clarke laid deep and strong<br />\nfoundations for the scientific and<br />\neconomic survey of Maryland for<br />\ngenerations to come.
