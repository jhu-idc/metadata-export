But this well was purposely drilled that way! In fact, precautions were<br />\ntaken to see that the well wouldn't contact oil-bearing sands. It was to be a vital part of an elaborate<br />\nwaste-disposal system built into one of Du Pont's<br />\nnew plants near Victoria, Texas. It is an example of<br />\nthe unusual engineering problems which Du Pont<br />\ntechnical men encounter.<br />\nThe \"well\" itself is almost a mile deep-4900 feet,<br />\nto be exact. Waste fluids from the plant are forced<br />\ndown this well, to be absorbed by non-oil-bearing<br />\nsands\u2014far below the level of any surface water.<br />\nPiping near ground level is in the form of concentric<br />\nshells, and fresh water is delivered to the annular<br />\nopening around the waste pipe. Furthermore, the<br />\nwater pressure is higher than that of the fluids in the<br />\n<br />\nwaste section. In this way, any leakage in the pipe<br />\nsystem causes fresh water to enter the surrounding<br />\nsands (or the inside waste system) and prevents<br />\nobjectionable materials from reaching the sands at<br />\nsurface levels.<br />\nOther interesting procedures are used throughout<br />\nDu Pont's many plants to guard against river pollution. For example, scientists were asked to make a<br />\ncomplete marine-life census on one river before a<br />\nplant was built nearby. The company wanted to be<br />\ncertain that no waste would be discharged which<br />\nwould challenge the natural pattern of marine life.<br />\nThroughoutthe DuPontCompany,whereverthere<br />\nis a need for the services of technical men,there are<br />\nvaried and interesting problems that present a challenge to engineering skill and imagination.<br />\n<br />\nco<br />\n<br />\nNow available for student ASME chapters and other<br />\ncollege groups,a 16-mm.sound color movie\u2014\"Mechanical Engineering at Du Pont.\" For further information, send post card to E.I.<br />\ndu Pont de Nemours& Co.(Inc.),2521 Nemours Bldg.,Wilmington<br />\n98, Delaware.<br />\n<br />\nBETTER THINGS FOR BETTER LIVING<br />\nTHROUGH CHEMISTRY<br />\n<br />\nWatch\"Cavalcade of America\"on Television<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE EIGHT<br />\n<br />\nHomewood, Baltimore, April 301 1954<br />\n<br />\nNEWS-LETTER<br />\n<br />\n\"Official\" Dorm Water Fight Sophomores Wake, 'Stormer's \"Boy Meets Girl\"<br />\nProposed By \"F\" Residents Object:DormSingles Last Production For Year<br />\nA proposal to allot two hundred<br />\ndollars of dormitory social funds<br />\nfor damages in an official water<br />\nfight was passed by a large majority of the students in F entry<br />\nlast Tuesday.<br />\nThe motion, made and seconded<br />\nby two juniors who requested that<br />\ntheir names be withheld, detailed<br />\nthat the water fight be 'official\"<br />\nand held during the month of<br />\nMay.<br />\nRoy T.

It was to be a vital part of an elaborate<br />\nwaste-disposal system built into one of Du Pont's<br />\nnew plants near Victoria, Texas.

Furthermore, the<br />\nwater pressure is higher than that of the fluids in the<br /><br />\nwaste section. In this way, any leakage in the pipe<br />\nsystem causes fresh water to enter the surrounding<br />\nsands (or the inside waste system) and prevents<br />\nobjectionable materials from reaching the sands at<br />\nsurface levels.<br />\nOther interesting procedures are used throughout<br />\nDu Pont's many plants to guard against river pollution. For example, scientists were asked to make a<br />\ncomplete marine-life census on one river before a<br />\nplant was built nearby.
