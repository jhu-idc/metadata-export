Perhaps by accident; perhaps by design.<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIf there were design in it, assuredly it was a hint that now is the<br />\n*<br />\ntime for the annual clarion call through the pages of this paper for<br />\na mass-meeting to organize a Dramatic Club. Observance has so<br />\n\u2022 VVIOVIIIIVVVVV<br />\nhonored this custom that now an autumn would feel lonesome withV V<br />\nout it ! Of course, nothing has come of it\u2014so far. (Last year, if<br />\nwe remember rightly, seven men attended the organization meeting.)<br />\nBut there is no reason why something should not come of it. \"When Hopkins moves to<br />\nHomewood\" is a proverb, and was once almost a synonym for \"never,\" and yet we have<br />\nmoved there to the extent of one of the best athletic fields in the country. The suggestion<br />\nthat we have a Dramatic Club is not chimerical. We could have one if we tried. We have<br />\nteams and good teams at Hopkins. We have Musical Clubs. Indeed, when we come to<br />\nthink of it, we have even a college paper. Hopkins is small; \"We're few, but we're\u2014er!\u2014<br />\nmighty select.\" If we want a Dramatic Club, we can have it. Do we want it?<br />\n.<br />\n<br />\nVW'S if<br />\n<br />\n41<br />\n'<br />\n''ilj31S1411*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\nHE NEWS-LETtER believes that the organization of the Cotillon Club,<br />\nor \"Dance Committee,\" could be improved upon. The present<br />\n*<br />\nCommittee is composed of excellent men, and we do not wish its<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\npersonnel to be changed in the least. But we have a suggestion to<br />\n*<br />\n*\u2022<br />\nmake for the future; a suggestion which \"catne to us from a prominent<br />\n.5<br />\n5.<br />\ni *<br />\n*<br />\n*Alumnus.<br />\n*<br />\n.<br />\n*<br />\nlif<br />\nThe Cotillon Club is essentially a social, not a class, organiza5<br />\ntion. At present the system of \"getting on the Committee\" is<br />\n*owe*<br />\nwwiftv*,<br />\nawkward<br />\nand seems to be subject to no very definite rule. Of late,<br />\n555<br />\nthe custom has grown up of having each retiring senior appoint his<br />\nsuccessor. Two places on the Committee are also offered as rewards to the freshmen who<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\ncollect the largest number of subscriptions from their class. If these rules are to be followed,<br />\nthe Club will increase enormously in size in a year or two. Last year there were ten on it.<br />\nNow, as we said, the three Hopkins Dances are social, not class, affairs. Would it<br />\nnot be better to have the Committee representative of the social side of University life without<br />\nregard to classes ? The social side of life here is represented mainly by the Fraternities. We<br />\nsuggest that in years to come each Fraternity be allowed to choose its representative on the<br />\nCotillon Club, and the non-Fraternity element of the University be represented by a nonFraternity man. We doubt greatly if this advice will be followed. Good advice seldom is.<br />\n<br />\nHAT is the matter with the Freshmen ? There are a lot of husky<br />\nmen in the class that are never seen at foot-ball practices. What we<br />\nwant on the team is beef, and every hefty fellow in the University<br />\nought to be in the cage every afternoon at half past four. What if<br />\nyou are not played on the 'Varsity all the time the first day you come<br />\nout ? Keep it up ! Attend the practices regularly and learn the<br />\nsignals, and sooner or later your chance will come.<br />\nttigittl<br />\nWe want to show what we can do in foot-ball this fall under<br />\nchanged conditions. To do it the team needs the support of every<br />\nman in the University. Some can play, others can root; but every<br />\none can buy a season ticket. Let each and every Hopkins man do his best, and this year's<br />\nteam will be a rousing success,<br />\n<br />\nf<br />\n<br />\nup.<br />\n<br />\nID you enjoy \"Strong-heart\" and \"Noah's Ark\" last year? In other<br />\nwords, did you enjoy the two Hopkins Nights? Of course, you did!<br />\nEvery one did. There is no reason why such pleasures should not<br />\ncome to us again this year\u2014not twice as last year, but three or four<br />\ntimes a year. We have a bully crowd of Seniors. The NEwsLETTIk is proud of them. They have done a lot for the University,<br />\nand if they get up several first-rate Hopkins Nights, they will be<br />\ndoing a lot more\u2014and incidentally will help their ''Hullabaloo.\"<br />\nThe idea of having some well-known alumnus (as Mr. Symington,<br />\nlast May) speak between the acts was a good one. Let it be kept<br />\nAnd don't wait till 'way next February. Get up a Hopkins Night soon, please.<br />\n<br />\nThe NEWS-LUTTER takes pleasure in announcing the election of Mr. George W.<br />\nCorner, 3rd, and Mr. W. V. Johnson, both of the Class of 1909, as regular members of the<br />\nEditorial board. Mr. Corner becomes Assistant News Editor, and Mr. Johnson Assistant<br />\nAthletic Editor. Other elections will probably take place in November.<br />\n<br />\nft<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\nAUREA BIBL1A;<br />\nOr, The Golden Bible.<br />\nThe red light of the Western sun was slowly<br />\ndeepening and darkening in the great rotunda<br />\nof the reading room of the British Museum.<br />\nIt was the stateliest hour of all the twenty-four<br />\nstately hours which make up every day in the<br />\nmassive gray stone pile. It was likewise the<br />\nquietest hour. The crowd of students who<br />\nhad been toiling all the afternoon were departing one by one ; the crowd of students\u2014almost<br />\nas large\u2014who work there evening after evening until midnight had not yet come.<br />\nIt was nearly dark in the corner where Eugene was reading. The familiar figure of the<br />\nKeeper of Printed Books, (Dr. Richard Garnett, who has since died), passed .by him. The<br />\nold man nodded kindly to the young student,<br />\nwho scarcely returned the courtesy, so deeply<br />\nwas he interested in the old volume which lay<br />\nbefore him.<br />\nTo a chance observer there was nothing remarkable about the book, save only its evident<br />\nantiquity; and to the frequenter of the Museum, who is familiar with the sight of the<br />\ngreat Bulls of Ninevah, old books\u2014even<br />\n\"cradle books\"\u2014seem as though made yesterday.<br />\nEugene turned over the leaves one after one,<br />\nfondling them lovingly. The book had no<br />\ntitle page\u2014it was printed before the days of<br />\nsuch\u2014but at the top of the first page was the<br />\nfollowing legend in Gothic type:<br />\n\"Cher mattualto at intraburtarina in Whitt<br />\nMotoring finuraggur urtrrig at flout trottunrntum<br />\nperoprinuto Anrra titbita mutating 31nri4tit fent-<br />\n<br />\nThe curious \"artifitialit effigat\" also struck his<br />\nattention, a forcible reminder of those days<br />\nwhen printing was not a separate art, but a<br />\nsort of artificial writing. Below this colophon<br />\nwas the customary :<br />\n\"Kano laro, rut Mt lionor vt t3loria in orrula<br />\norrulornnt.<br />\nThe remark of a famous writer flashed<br />\nthrough Eugene's mind. \u2018\"How many a work<br />\nbegun happily (incipit fclicitcr) is finished in<br />\nsorrow and gloom and disappointment.\" Was<br />\nperhaps this the case here? he mused. The<br />\nwood-cut capitals ceased to be rubricated some<br />\npages from the end. Why was this? Eugene<br />\nwas drowsy, and drowsily he called up in his<br />\nmind the youthful apprentice of long ago<br />\nworking away on these very capitals. What<br />\ntbouglits accompanied, perhaps, the painting<br />\nof that L? It was very dark and very still<br />\nunder the rotunda. But two students' lamps<br />\nwere lit. Suddenly the darkness and stillness<br />\nwere gone.<br />\n<br />\n\"Just once more, good-bye, sweetheart! It<br />\nwon't be so very long! A' year from now and<br />\nthis accursed apprenticeship will be at last<br />\nover, and then I will come back and get you,<br />\nand we will live always as* merrily as a lark<br />\non a spring morning.\"<br />\nThe young voice rang clearly out in the<br />\nfresh mountain air. The speaker was a lad of<br />\ntwenty or so ; his \"sweetheart\" a girl rather<br />\nyounger. They stood before a roughly<br />\nthatched cottage. Ilefore them stretched the<br />\nroad to Ulm.

Behind him was a partly open door,<br />\nthought Eugene. \"There every word is spelt through which a glimpse could be caught of<br />\nout; here abbreviations are used everywhere.\" a fat little blond-haired man working hard at<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\na machine which looked not unlike a modern<br />\ncider-press.<br />\nBefore the young writer was a fresh, white<br />\npage, on which the black ink, scarce dry,<br />\nshone merrily. \"LIBER MANUALIS,\" the book<br />\nbegan. The youth carefully reddened the L,<br />\nand, reading on down the page, came to \"INCIPIT FELICITER.\" Here was a good omen,<br />\nthought he, and with a little nervous tremor,<br />\nto which the unevenness of the line bore witness, he underlined the words lightly in red.<br />\nIt was the same room several months later.<br />\nThe little blond-haired printer was standing<br />\nbeside the young man. His hand rested on<br />\nthe lad's shoulder. He looked at him kindly.<br />\n\"You will get over it, my boy,\" he said. \"All<br />\nwomen are alike. Out of sight, out of mind!<br />\nIf she would not wait a short year for you, do<br />\nyou think she was really worth having for always?\"<br />\n\"'Please do not talk like that, Herr Johann.<br />\nShe was and is an angel. She has forgotten<br />\nme, but who am I to be remembered? Only<br />\n\u2014it does seem a little hard just now, when I<br />\nwas working so eagerly\u2014for her.\"<br />\n\"Be a brave lad,\" said the printer. \"Go back<br />\nto your work. It's a brave art, a wonderful<br />\nart. Forget all the women and lose yourself<br />\nin your work. Go on now with the Golden<br />\nBible. You've nearly finished it, haven't you ?\"<br />\n\"I will go on\u2014I will try to forget, Herr Johann. But I can never, no, never, go back<br />\nto the red initials of the Aurea Biblia. I must<br />\nleave it unfinished, and for my sake, though<br />\nit's a foolish whim, let the initials of this particular copy remain white. Look, it's the copy<br />\nI beg-an with last May. Here, under this incipit felicitcr, I made a bright red line. I was<br />\na fool.\"<br />\n<br />\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" is the greatest of<br />\nthe-Roman plays. Technically it is not planned<br />\nwith the skill of \"Julius Czesar,\" but the action<br />\nis more varied, the sphere of interest larger,<br />\nand the passions more deeply moved than in<br />\nthe tragedy which historically precedes it. The<br />\nmarvelous banquet scene, at the close of which<br />\nthe third ruler of the world is carried out by<br />\nhis slaves, teaches as great a moral lesson as<br />\ndoes the scene in \"Othello\" where Cassius is<br />\nintoxicated.<br />\n\"0 that men should put an enemy in their mouths<br />\nTo take away their brains.\"<br />\n<br />\nIt is at once interesting and pathetic to the<br />\nstudent of human nature that these two terrible scenes\u2014and the \"wan mirth of the mirthless fool\" in \"Lear--teaching such terrible<br />\nand fundamental moral lessons, yet never fail<br />\nto provoke as many roars of laughter from the<br />\naudience as do the orgies of Sir Toby ,or<br />\nof Stephan\u00b0.<br />\nIn his admirable new life of Shakespeare<br />\n(mentioned, by the way, in the last number of<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER) Prof. Walter Raleigh expresses the opinion that the death of Cleopatra<br />\nin Shakespeare \"falls short\" of the same scene<br />\nas described by Plutarch. I cannot agree with<br />\nhim. The final scene of the tragedy compares<br />\nfor fervor, for passion, for sublimity, with the<br />\nclose of \"Lear,\" and to me, at least, is finer art<br />\nthan is the consummation of the tragedy in<br />\n\"Othello.\" Faithfulness to her lover is in the<br />\nend of more importance to Cleopatra than her<br />\npassion for him, and her following him even<br />\nto death gives her the right to say: \"Husband, I come!\"<br />\nTo mention Professor Raleigh again:<br />\nspeaking of anachronisms in Shakespeare, he<br />\nwrites:<br />\n\"There are clocks in 'Julius Cesar,' a paper<br />\nmill and printing in 'Henry VI,' etc, etc. InRoman plays, Shakespeare<br />\nEugene awoke with a start. He gazed cu- deed, except in the<br />\nin<br />\nall the movement and defill<br />\nto<br />\nleave<br />\ntakes<br />\nriously at the yellow pages before him. \"Inhis own world.\"<br />\nfrom<br />\nplay<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\ntail<br />\ncipit fcliciter!\"<br />\nYet Cleopatra plays billiards and Antony<br />\nquotes the Psalms:<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEW BOOK SHELF.<br />\n<br />\nLast month the fifteenth volume of the New<br />\nVariorum Shakespeare\u2014\"Antony and Cleopatra\"\u2014was published, being the first volume<br />\nwhich Dr. Furness has issued since the fall of<br />\n1904.<br />\n<br />\n\"0 that I were<br />\nUpon the hill of Basan to outroar<br />\nThe horned herd.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe only comment on this latter fact in Dr.<br />\nFurness' edition is quoted from Singer, who<br />\nsuggests that Antony may have learnt the<br />\n<br />\n\f6<br />\n<br />\n'1'1 E NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\npsalms from Herod, who was his friend. In a<br />\nrecent letter to the present writer Dr. Furness<br />\nwrites:<br />\n\"As to the hills of Basan, I gave the references from the Bible merely to show where<br />\nAntony found his allusion, and not to any conversation with Herod, as Singer most foolishly suggests.\"<br />\nThe passage is simply one of the many<br />\nanachronisms in Shakespeare.<br />\nThe various prefaces to the New Variorum<br />\nShakespeare form in themselves charming essays. In the preface to the present volume it<br />\nis interesting to note that Dr. Furness considers Dryden's Ali for Love \"an admirable<br />\nplay,\" an opinion long held by the present<br />\nwriter, which it is pleasing to find sanctioned<br />\nby the highest authority.<br />\nA most interesting and instructive portion<br />\nof the book is the essay on the various \"versions\" of this tragedy, which have been written<br />\nfrom the middle of the sixteenth century to<br />\nthe time of Mr. Bernard Shaw.

When Pamela or Virtue<br />\nRewarded, appeared the clergy hailed it with<br />\njoy. It was to them as assistance from the<br />\nenemy. Richardson modestly sums up his<br />\nnovel in the following sentence:<br />\n\"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded, is a series of<br />\nfamiliar letters from a beautiful young damsel to her parents, published in order to cultivate the principles of virtue and religion in the<br />\nminds of the youth of both sexes ; a narrative<br />\nwhich has its foundation in truth, and at the<br />\nsame time that it agreeably entertains by a<br />\nvariety of curious and affecting incidents, is<br />\nentirely divested of all those images which in<br />\ntoo many pieces calculated for amusement<br />\nonly, tend to inflame the minds that they<br />\nshould instruct.\" This is something of a sentence, even, for Richardson.<br />\nIn this novel we have the struggle of virtue<br />\nand vice.

Hugo he maimed into \"Hugh;\"<br />\nthe mangled corpse of Burns was scarcely<br />\nrecognized as ''Bruns;'' he so crushed Plautus<br />\nthat the proud capital \"P\" of the Latin<br />\ndramatist was deformed into \"p;\" Mr. Percy<br />\nMcRaye became \"Mr. Percy McVey.\" The<br />\n\"Printer's Devil\" also had trouble with<br />\nTennyson's \"hollow Os and As\" with the<br />\nresult that \"Osianna\" became \"Asianna.\"<br />\nWorse than all these, our President himself<br />\nwas not safe and Doctor Remsen was exhibited<br />\nto our horror-stricken gaze as \"Doctor<br />\nRenzen.\" Another queer trait of the creature<br />\nis the hydra-like rapidity with which his mis'\u2014multiply.<br />\nbegotten offspring\u2014 misprints'<br />\nAs fast as one is slain another takes its place.<br />\nTo speak seriously for a moment, no one<br />\nwho has not had experience in reading proof<br />\ncan realize the corrections that have to be<br />\nmade in \"galley-proof,\"and even after a second<br />\nreading one cannot be sure that no misprints<br />\nexist. The last number of the NEws-LETTER<br />\nwas published hastily owing to some unavoidable delays in getting the advertising arranged<br />\nand considering the fact that only one proof<br />\nwas read, and that hurriedly, the six or seven<br />\nmisprints need not be a cause of great triumph<br />\nto the \"Printer's Devil.\"<br />\n<br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHS<br />\n<br />\nLONDON STUDIO<br />\n112 W.

Perhaps by accident; perhaps by design.<br />\n*<br />\n\u2022<br />\nIf there were design in it, assuredly it was a hint that now is the<br />\n*<br />\ntime for the annual clarion call through the pages of this paper for<br />\na mass-meeting to organize a Dramatic Club. Observance has so<br />\n\u2022 VVIOVIIIIVVVVV<br />\nhonored this custom that now an autumn would feel lonesome withV V<br />\nout it ! Of course, nothing has come of it\u2014so far. (Last year, if<br />\nwe remember rightly, seven men attended the organization meeting.)<br />\nBut there is no reason why something should not come of it. \"When Hopkins moves to<br />\nHomewood\" is a proverb, and was once almost a synonym for \"never,\" and yet we have<br />\nmoved there to the extent of one of the best athletic fields in the country. The suggestion<br />\nthat we have a Dramatic Club is not chimerical. We could have one if we tried. We have<br />\nteams and good teams at Hopkins. We have Musical Clubs. Indeed, when we come to<br />\nthink of it, we have even a college paper. Hopkins is small; \"We're few, but we're\u2014er!\u2014<br />\nmighty select.\" If we want a Dramatic Club, we can have it. Do we want it?<br />\n.<br /><br />\nVW'S if<br /><br />\n41<br />\n'<br />\n''ilj31S1411*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\n*<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-LETtER believes that the organization of the Cotillon Club,<br />\nor \"Dance Committee,\" could be improved upon. The present<br />\n*<br />\nCommittee is composed of excellent men, and we do not wish its<br />\n*<br />\n*<br />\npersonnel to be changed in the least. But we have a suggestion to<br />\n*<br />\n*\u2022<br />\nmake for the future; a suggestion which \"catne to us from a prominent<br />\n.5<br />\n5.<br />\ni *<br />\n*<br />\n*Alumnus.<br />\n*<br />\n.<br />\n*<br />\nlif<br />\nThe Cotillon Club is essentially a social, not a class, organiza5<br />\ntion. At present the system of \"getting on the Committee\" is<br />\n*owe*<br />\nwwiftv*,<br />\nawkward<br />\nand seems to be subject to no very definite rule. Of late,<br />\n555<br />\nthe custom has grown up of having each retiring senior appoint his<br />\nsuccessor. Two places on the Committee are also offered as rewards to the freshmen who<br />\n\u2022<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\ncollect the largest number of subscriptions from their class. If these rules are to be followed,<br />\nthe Club will increase enormously in size in a year or two. Last year there were ten on it.<br />\nNow, as we said, the three Hopkins Dances are social, not class, affairs. Would it<br />\nnot be better to have the Committee representative of the social side of University life without<br />\nregard to classes ? The social side of life here is represented mainly by the Fraternities. We<br />\nsuggest that in years to come each Fraternity be allowed to choose its representative on the<br />\nCotillon Club, and the non-Fraternity element of the University be represented by a nonFraternity man. We doubt greatly if this advice will be followed. Good advice seldom is.<br /><br />\nHAT is the matter with the Freshmen ? There are a lot of husky<br />\nmen in the class that are never seen at foot-ball practices. What we<br />\nwant on the team is beef, and every hefty fellow in the University<br />\nought to be in the cage every afternoon at half past four. What if<br />\nyou are not played on the 'Varsity all the time the first day you come<br />\nout ? Keep it up ! Attend the practices regularly and learn the<br />\nsignals, and sooner or later your chance will come.<br />\nttigittl<br />\nWe want to show what we can do in foot-ball this fall under<br />\nchanged conditions. To do it the team needs the support of every<br />\nman in the University. Some can play, others can root; but every<br />\none can buy a season ticket. Let each and every Hopkins man do his best, and this year's<br />\nteam will be a rousing success,<br /><br />\nf<br /><br />\nup.<br /><br />\nID you enjoy \"Strong-heart\" and \"Noah's Ark\" last year? In other<br />\nwords, did you enjoy the two Hopkins Nights? Of course, you did!<br />\nEvery one did. There is no reason why such pleasures should not<br />\ncome to us again this year\u2014not twice as last year, but three or four<br />\ntimes a year. We have a bully crowd of Seniors. The NEwsLETTIk is proud of them. They have done a lot for the University,<br />\nand if they get up several first-rate Hopkins Nights, they will be<br />\ndoing a lot more\u2014and incidentally will help their ''Hullabaloo.\"<br />\nThe idea of having some well-known alumnus (as Mr. Symington,<br />\nlast May) speak between the acts was a good one. Let it be kept<br />\nAnd don't wait till 'way next February. Get up a Hopkins Night soon, please.<br /><br />\nThe NEWS-LUTTER takes pleasure in announcing the election of Mr. George W.<br />\nCorner, 3rd, and Mr. W. V. Johnson, both of the Class of 1909, as regular members of the<br />\nEditorial board. Mr. Corner becomes Assistant News Editor, and Mr. Johnson Assistant<br />\nAthletic Editor. Other elections will probably take place in November.<br /><br />\nft<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\nAUREA BIBL1A;<br />\nOr, The Golden Bible.<br />\nThe red light of the Western sun was slowly<br />\ndeepening and darkening in the great rotunda<br />\nof the reading room of the British Museum.<br />\nIt was the stateliest hour of all the twenty-four<br />\nstately hours which make up every day in the<br />\nmassive gray stone pile. It was likewise the<br />\nquietest hour. The crowd of students who<br />\nhad been toiling all the afternoon were departing one by one ; the crowd of students\u2014almost<br />\nas large\u2014who work there evening after evening until midnight had not yet come.<br />\nIt was nearly dark in the corner where Eugene was reading. The familiar figure of the<br />\nKeeper of Printed Books, (Dr. Richard Garnett, who has since died), passed .by him. The<br />\nold man nodded kindly to the young student,<br />\nwho scarcely returned the courtesy, so deeply<br />\nwas he interested in the old volume which lay<br />\nbefore him.<br />\nTo a chance observer there was nothing remarkable about the book, save only its evident<br />\nantiquity; and to the frequenter of the Museum, who is familiar with the sight of the<br />\ngreat Bulls of Ninevah, old books\u2014even<br />\n\"cradle books\"\u2014seem as though made yesterday.<br />\nEugene turned over the leaves one after one,<br />\nfondling them lovingly. The book had no<br />\ntitle page\u2014it was printed before the days of<br />\nsuch\u2014but at the top of the first page was the<br />\nfollowing legend in Gothic type:<br />\n\"Cher mattualto at intraburtarina in Whitt<br />\nMotoring finuraggur urtrrig at flout trottunrntum<br />\nperoprinuto Anrra titbita mutating 31nri4tit fent-<br /><br />\nThe curious \"artifitialit effigat\" also struck his<br />\nattention, a forcible reminder of those days<br />\nwhen printing was not a separate art, but a<br />\nsort of artificial writing. Below this colophon<br />\nwas the customary :<br />\n\"Kano laro, rut Mt lionor vt t3loria in orrula<br />\norrulornnt.<br />\nThe remark of a famous writer flashed<br />\nthrough Eugene's mind. \u2018\"How many a work<br />\nbegun happily (incipit fclicitcr) is finished in<br />\nsorrow and gloom and disappointment.\" Was<br />\nperhaps this the case here? he mused. The<br />\nwood-cut capitals ceased to be rubricated some<br />\npages from the end. Why was this? Eugene<br />\nwas drowsy, and drowsily he called up in his<br />\nmind the youthful apprentice of long ago<br />\nworking away on these very capitals. What<br />\ntbouglits accompanied, perhaps, the painting<br />\nof that L? It was very dark and very still<br />\nunder the rotunda. But two students' lamps<br />\nwere lit. Suddenly the darkness and stillness<br />\nwere gone.<br /><br />\n\"Just once more, good-bye, sweetheart! It<br />\nwon't be so very long!

To understand the<br />\nEnglish novel you must understand Richardson. When we consider the times in which<br />\nRichardson wrote we must admit the excellence of his novels. What ever may be their<br />\nfaults in execution, their conception was good.<br />\nRichardson tried and just missed being a great<br />\nnovelist. Fielding profited by the novels of<br />\nRichardson. Joseph . indrews, published after<br />\nRichardson's Pamela, was suggested to him<br />\nby the former novel.<br />\nRichardson did not understand men. All<br />\nhis men, with the exception of Sir Charles<br />\nGrandison, are villains. And Sir Charles<br />\nGrandison seems to have stepped out of a<br />\nfashion plate. His letters seem to have been<br />\ncopied from \"M rs. Grundy's Complete LetterWriter.\" He is about as human as a clothes<br />\ndummy. Richardson was a woman's writer.<br />\nAll his novels were widely read by women.<br />\nHis popularity was among women. And why?<br />\nHe understood a woman's mind. He appreciated the fine side of a woman's nature. He<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\ncould sympathize with the feelings of a<br />\nwoman's heart.<br />\nWhile we are criticising Richardson, let us<br />\ngive him the credit due him. He was the first<br />\nEnglish novelist. No one had ever gone before him, by whose mistakes he could profit.<br />\nHis novels were all his own. He opened the<br />\npath where, years later, Thackeray, Dickens,<br />\nCharles Reade and Scott were to follow.<br />\nW.<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n11<br /><br />\nILGENFRITZ STUDIO<br />\nSuccessor to Ctimmz Ns<br /><br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHY<br />\nBALTIMORE<br />\n20 West Lexington Street<br />\nSpecial Discount to Students<br /><br />\n\"The Men's Store.\"<br /><br />\nHUTZLER BKIIIIEIZ<br />\n210 t. 21s NORTH HOWARD ST.<br /><br />\n' WHAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.<br />\n[This game is a harmless and childlike<br />\namusement.

In the last number of the NEWSLETTER he made a furious onslaught on several<br />\nfamous poets. Hugo he maimed into \"Hugh;\"<br />\nthe mangled corpse of Burns was scarcely<br />\nrecognized as ''Bruns;'' he so crushed Plautus<br />\nthat the proud capital \"P\" of the Latin<br />\ndramatist was deformed into \"p;\" Mr. Percy<br />\nMcRaye became \"Mr. Percy McVey.\" The<br />\n\"Printer's Devil\" also had trouble with<br />\nTennyson's \"hollow Os and As\" with the<br />\nresult that \"Osianna\" became \"Asianna.\"<br />\nWorse than all these, our President himself<br />\nwas not safe and Doctor Remsen was exhibited<br />\nto our horror-stricken gaze as \"Doctor<br />\nRenzen.\" Another queer trait of the creature<br />\nis the hydra-like rapidity with which his mis'\u2014multiply.<br />\nbegotten offspring\u2014 misprints'<br />\nAs fast as one is slain another takes its place.<br />\nTo speak seriously for a moment, no one<br />\nwho has not had experience in reading proof<br />\ncan realize the corrections that have to be<br />\nmade in \"galley-proof,\"and even after a second<br />\nreading one cannot be sure that no misprints<br />\nexist. The last number of the NEws-LETTER<br />\nwas published hastily owing to some unavoidable delays in getting the advertising arranged<br />\nand considering the fact that only one proof<br />\nwas read, and that hurriedly, the six or seven<br />\nmisprints need not be a cause of great triumph<br />\nto the \"Printer's Devil.\"<br /><br />\nARTISTIC PHOTOGRAPHS<br /><br />\nLONDON STUDIO<br />\n112 W.
