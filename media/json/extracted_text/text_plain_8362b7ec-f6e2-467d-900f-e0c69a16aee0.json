Starting on their tour through the plant<br />\nat ten in the morning the students<br />\nremained there until four in the<br />\nafternoon, taking off only a half<br />\nhour for lunch. Despite this long<br />\nperiod spent in the plant, the students say they did not see even a<br />\nquarter of the numerous types of<br />\napparatus.

The committee,<br />\nwhich consists of Drs. French, Latane and Swartz, was called for the<br />\npurpose of acting on a resolution<br />\npassed by the Student Council in<br />\nApril. Thomas P. Magill, president-elect of the Student Council,<br />\nand Daniel Klein-, secretary, conferred with the committee concerning the present conditions and future policy of the Student Council.<br />\nDean Ames has- heartily approved of the resolution which has<br />\nbroadened the Student Council's<br />\npowers so as to include supervision<br />\nof conduct in all places where individuals Or groups are gathered<br />\nas Hopkins students. In the second<br />\narticle the Council has resolved to<br />\nmake the honor system more effective. The third and last article<br />\nempowers the Student Council to<br />\nexercise jurisdiction over the second floor of the barn, excepting<br />\nthe Y. M. C. A. and Athletic offices.<br />\nResolutions Adopted<br /><br />\nThe new resolution widening the<br />\nfield of the Student Council's jurisdiction is as follows:<br />\n1. The Student Council shall be<br />\nempowered to promote good order<br />\nin undergraduate affairs and shall<br />\nexercise primary jurisdiction in<br />\nquestions of conduct on the part of<br />\nany undergraduate or group of undergraduates which shall be deemed<br />\nunbecoming a gentleman or prejudicial to the honor of the university.<br />\n2. The Council Stall take measures to make the Johns Hopkins<br />\nhonor system effective in examinations, quizzes and student exercises<br />\nof all sorts.<br />\n3. The Council shall exercise<br />\njurisdiction over the second floor<br />\nof the \"Barn\" exclusive of the Y.<br />\nM. C. A. and Athletic offices.<br />\nThis step of the Student Council<br />\nhas been greeted with universal approval both by the faculty and student body. It is regarded as a move<br />\nto protect the name of the university from undeserved criticism and<br />\nto have some check on Hopkins affairs off the campus.<br />\nWILLISON ELECTED HEAD OF<br />\nDEBATING COUNCIL<br />\nAt a meeting of the Debating<br />\nCouncil held last Thursday the officers and delegates for the ensuing<br />\nyear were elected.

The debates were popular and well supported until very<br />\nrecently, so the Council will try to<br />\nbring them back to their former<br />\nstatus in the eyes- of the students. -<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, MD., MAY 20, 1924<br /><br />\n0.

P. Thomas, of the<br />\nexecutive committee, who is in<br />\ncharge of getting alumni back for<br />\nthe various affairs. The class of<br />\n1923 will probably have the largest<br />\nrepresentation as seventy-five of<br />\nlast year's graduates intend to return to the campus. Thomas Landy, chairman of 1923 June Week,<br />\nhas been working quietly for several months and a majority of the<br />\nclass is expected to be on hand<br />\nwhen the curtain goes up for the<br />\nfirst affair.<br />\nThe classes of 1919 and 1914 are<br />\nplanning reunions and prominent<br />\nmembers of the classes of 1909 and<br />\n1904 are endeavoring to get their<br />\nmembers back in the fold. The<br />\nclass of 1899, of which Dr. J. C.<br />\nFrench is a member, is planning a<br />\nreunion to last several days. If<br />\nthese classes all return, five, ten, fifteen, twenty and twenty-five year<br />\nreunions will be held and the June<br />\nWeek affairs will be attended by<br />\na large number of Hopkins graduates.<br />\nGraduates Will Be Welcomed<br /><br />\nSeveral special features have<br />\nbeen arranged for the old boys.<br />\nBooths will be specially constructed<br />\nfor them at the dances and it is<br />\nprobable that arrangements will be<br />\nmade so that out-of-town alumni<br />\nmay be housed in the Memorial<br />\nDormitory. Representatives from<br />\nthese classes will be asked to take<br />\na part in the Class Day exercises<br />\nand in other functions.<br />\nThe committee is spending a<br />\nlarge amount of time makink plans<br />\nfor the cabaret in the Botanical<br />\nGardens, to be held simultanecusly<br />\nwith the Last Cotillon and the Student Activities dance. A negro orchestra has been secured to furnish<br />\nthe music between numbers and it<br />\nis probable that a platform for<br />\ndances will be constructed. It is<br />\nthought that dancing to dreamy<br />\nmelodies by the light of the moon<br />\nand dim .Japanese lanterns will<br />\nprove very attractive..
