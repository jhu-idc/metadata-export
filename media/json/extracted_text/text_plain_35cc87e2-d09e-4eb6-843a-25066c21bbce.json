Mr. Leithiser stated that<br />\nthe condition of the treasury was<br />\nnot such as would conform to the<br />\ndemands of the class at this time.<br />\nHe made an appeal to the seniors<br />\nfor all the financial support possible, stating the exact amount<br />\nnecessary for the first payment on<br />\nthe Hullabaloo.<br />\nThe election of officers, which<br />\nwas next in order; resulted as follows:<br />\nPresident\u2014Thomas J.

The class is not<br />\nas large as are most graduating<br />\nclasses, and on that account will no<br />\ndoubt experience some difficulty<br />\nin making progress during the first<br />\nfew weeks of this year. There is,<br />\nhowever, a marked willingness to<br />\nwork among the seniors, and with<br />\nthe whole situation in view the<br />\nprospects seem bright.<br />\n<br />\nBY COACH CHARLES E. BRICKLEY,<br />\n<br />\nThe fortieth academic year began<br />\nlast Tuesday, October 5, with the<br />\nadmission of 127 new students to<br />\nthe undergraduate department of<br />\nthe University. Dean Murray P.<br />\nBrush, formerly collegiate professor of French, met the entering students, both academic and engineering, in the Donovan Room the day<br />\npreceding. Following his address,<br />\nshort talks were given by Hiram<br />\nWoodward, of the Student Council,<br />\nand Captain Primrose, of the football team.<br />\nThere was no \"hazing\" again this<br />\nyear. The freshmen\u2022 regulations,<br />\nhowever, were inaugurated with<br />\nsuccess. Every freshman may now<br />\nbe seen wearing a small white button adorned with a conspicuous<br />\nletter \"F\" in green. These are provided by the Student Council and<br />\nare on sale at the postoffice. Freshmen are prohibited from wearing<br />\nhats or riding in the elevator in the<br />\nUniversity buildings.<br />\nSince last year there have been<br />\nmany changes in the University<br />\nfaculty. The loss of Dr. Gildersleeve and Dean Griffin has been<br />\nkeenly felt. Dr. Griffin, who for<br />\ntwenty-six years was dean of the<br />\ncollegiate faculty, has been succeeded by Dr. Brush, while his<br />\nclasses in philosophy will be conducted by Prof. Slonimsky,formerly<br />\nof Columbia. Dean Brush will continue to teach some of his classes<br />\nin French. Dr. J. D. Janney takes<br />\nthe place of Dr. Rollins as instructor in English, and Dr. Carcassonne<br />\nconies to the Romance department<br />\nas professor of French literature.<br />\nSeveral new courses will be given<br />\nthis year, most noteworthy of which<br />\nis that of political science I, which<br />\nhas attracted a large class. In view<br />\nof a new Maryland law whereby<br />\ncollege graduates applying for positions in the State high schools are<br />\nexempt from the usual examinations<br />\nf they have had the equivalent of<br />\ntwo hundred hours of class instruction in education, two undergraduate courses will be given in this<br />\nsubject\u2014the history of education<br />\nand the principles of education.<br />\nThese will be given in the afternoon, twice a week, by Professor<br />\nBuchner.<br />\nOn October 9, the college course<br />\nfor teachers began and announcements were made regarding the<br />\nneW University degree of bachelor<br />\nof science in education. For social<br />\nworkers special courses are given<br />\nin social problems, hygiene and psychology. As psychology will not<br />\nform a part of philosophy I this<br />\n<br />\nPresident Frank J. Goodnow returned to the University Monday<br />\nmorning after an absence of several<br />\nmonths in China, where he is constitutional adviser to the republic.<br />\nDuring his stay in China Dr.<br />\nGoodnow was much concerned with<br />\nthe question as to whether the monarchial form of government is better for China than a republic. Upon<br />\nbeing asked to pass upon the question, he answered that in view of<br />\nthe present state of China and considering its traditions a constitutional monarchy would perhaps be<br />\nthe better form. He added, however, that to go back to the old form<br />\nof absolute monarchy would be a<br />\nstep backward. He has not ceased<br />\nto believe in popular government.<br />\nDr. Goodnow stated upon his arrival that, although he was not prepared to discuss the affairs of the<br />\nUniversity at the time, he was inclined to favor the idea of introducing military training into the life of<br />\nthe undergraduates, according to<br />\nthe suggestion made by members of<br />\nthe Alumni Association.<br />\nUpon being asked whether- he<br />\nwould accept the position of chairman of the commission recently appointed to take up the problem of<br />\nabolishing useless State offices and<br />\nworking economy in the State of<br />\nMaryland, he stated that he was not<br />\nable to say definitely what he would<br />\ndo. He declared himself in sympathy with the idea, but added that<br />\nsince he was not familiar with the<br />\nwork of the commission he was undecided as to what to do.<br />\nIn Dr. Goodnow's party and returning with him were Mrs. Goodnow; their daughter, Miss Lois<br />\nGoodnow; their neices, the Misses<br />\nEleanor Goodnow and Dorothy<br />\nBigelow; Dr. W. W. Willoughby<br />\nand Dr. David M. Robinson, of the<br />\nUniversity faculty.<br />\nThey met Dr. William H. Welch<br />\nand Dr. Simon Flexner in China.<br />\nThe latter are not expected to return home until after Christmas.<br />\nClifford A. Wells, A. B. '14, has<br />\nresigned the fellowship in Classical<br />\nArcheology recently awarded him<br />\nand has enlisted in the Fourth University Company of the Canadian<br />\nExpeditionary Force and is expecting to go to the front at an early<br />\ndate.<br />\nyear, those interested may avail<br />\nthemselves of Professor Dunlap's<br />\ncourse in introductory general psychology.<br />\n<br />\nProf. Emerson to Riordon School.<br />\n<br />\nProf. Alfred Emerson, formerly<br />\nof Johns Hopkins, has assumed the<br />\ndepartments of history and languages at the Raymond Riordon<br />\nSchool for Boys on Ckiodirce Lake,<br />\nHighland-on-Hudson.<br />\nHe was in charge of classical<br />\nand antiquities, sculpture and architectural collections at the Art Institute of Chicago for ten years, director of the Bennett Museum of<br />\nChristian Archaeology at Garrett<br />\nBiblical Institute for seven years.<br />\nHe held the Greek fellowship during<br />\nhis post-graduate work at Hopkins<br />\nand was also an instructor.<br />\n<br />\nLet it be understood at the very<br />\noutset that in these articles which<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER has asked me<br />\nto write after each Hopkins game<br />\nI shall make no comments upon the<br />\nplaying of individuals; that privilege I must insist upon reserving<br />\nfor the privacy of the blackboard<br />\ntalk or the football field. Whatever<br />\nI may say concerns the Hopkins<br />\nsquad as a whole.<br />\nThe game on Saturday was, as<br />\nmight be expected of a first game,<br />\na very crude affair, but it served to<br />\ngive Mr. Brennick and myself a<br />\nline on the playing abilities of the<br />\nmen. Many a man is apt to do well<br />\nin scrimmage and then fall down<br />\nin an actual game, and vice versa.<br />\nI will say for the men Saturday that<br />\nnearly every one performed better<br />\nin the game than in the practice<br />\nscrimmages.<br />\nThe. men were sent into the game<br />\nwith very few plays, but with what<br />\nI thought was a good defense. In<br />\nmy opinion, a team must get a good<br />\ndefense first of all. If you have a<br />\ngood defense, the other fellow cannot beat you, even though you don't<br />\ndefeat him.<br />\nI was much pleased with the Hopkins kicking department on Saturday. The drop-kicking, place-kicking and kick-offs were very well<br />\nexecuted\u2014much better than I had<br />\nexpected. As to the punting, there<br />\nwere not enough punts made by<br />\nHopkins to be able to pass judgment upon.<br />\nThe work of the line was good<br />\nin spots, but of course the men did<br />\nnot begin to have the team-play<br />\nwhich will come with their development in football knowledge. Although it may not have seemed so<br />\nto the spectators, the line was much<br />\nbetter defensively than on offense.<br />\nNext Saturday's game should show<br />\na distinct improvement in the offensive work of the Hopkins line.<br />\nThe backfield men played well<br />\nas individuals, but team-work was<br />\nlacking here as in the line. The<br />\ninterference was for the most part<br />\ncrude and ineffective, as the men<br />\nahead of the runner with the ball<br />\ndid not move fast enough to get out<br />\nof his way.<br />\nWhat really pleased me most on<br />\nSaturday was the spirit of the Hopkins men, both on the field and in<br />\nthe stands. The players (with the<br />\nexception of that despairing second<br />\nperiod so chock full of mistakes)<br />\nwent at- their opponents in a business-like way, as if \u2022 they realized<br />\nthat the way to win is by playing<br />\n(Continued on page 8, col. 3)<br />\n<br />\n\f2<br />\n<br />\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS NEWS-LETTER, OCTOBER 11, 1915.<br />\n\\<br />\n<br />\nIS<br />\n<br />\nMUSICAL CLUBS BEGIN WORK<br />\n<br />\nHULLABALOO OUTLOOK BRIGHT COLLEGE CAPTAINS' POSITIONS<br />\n<br />\nTryouts and Preliminary Meetings to Be<br />\nHeld This Week\u2014Work on Both<br />\nClubs to Begin at Once.<br />\n<br />\nMeeting of Board to BeHeld Today\u2014Bagley Resigns as Business Manager.<br />\nWork to Begin Immediately.<br />\n<br />\nWhere the Captains of Forty-one More<br />\nImportant Colleges Play\u2014Tackle<br />\nthe Most Popular Position.<br />\n<br />\nThe first meeting of the Musical<br />\nClubs for this year will be held<br />\nTuesday, October 12, at 1.15 P.<br />\nM., in the Trophy Room, for the<br />\npurpose of bringing last year's men<br />\ntogether, laying out plans for the<br />\nyear and considering several matters of importance which have<br />\npresented themselves since the end<br />\nof last season. The meeting will<br />\nbe attended by members of last<br />\nyear's clubs only.<br />\nAlthough the election of officers<br />\nfor this year took place at the end<br />\nof last year, two vacancies on the<br />\nBoard of Managers have been created through the failure of two of<br />\nthe elected members to return to<br />\nthe University this fall. These<br />\nvacancies will be filled at the earliest possible opportunity. The loss<br />\nof Leader Geissel, of the Instrumental Club, who has accepted a<br />\nposition in the West, will be felt<br />\nmost keenly, and the remaining<br />\nmembers of the Board have a<br />\nserious problem before them in the<br />\nselection of a new leader. At a<br />\nmeeting of the Board which was<br />\nheld Friday, E. M. Spieker, '16,<br />\nwas appointed as temporary coach<br />\nof the Instrumental Club, to hold<br />\noffice until a satisfactory leader can<br />\nbe selected.<br />\nWith the advent of new material<br />\nfrom the incoming class, and with<br />\nthe advantage of a firm financial<br />\nfooting, the prospects for the season are very good. Negotiations<br />\nfor a number of trips are under<br />\nconsideration and several town<br />\nconcerts have been arranged. Work<br />\non both clubs will begin immediately, and with good progress the<br />\nleaders hope to be able to open the<br />\nseason shortly before the Christmas vacation.<br />\nThe system of governing the<br />\nclubs by a board of managers,<br />\nwhich was instituted at the beginning of last year, has been carried<br />\nout with much success; now that<br />\nthe ground in the new field has<br />\nbeen broken by a year's work of<br />\nthe Board, the clubs are in excellent shape to go ahead under the<br />\nnew rules. The affairs of the<br />\nclubs promise to run very smoothly<br />\nfrom now on.<br />\nA meeting at which candidates<br />\nfor the clubs are to report will be<br />\nheld in McCoy Hall on Wednesday<br />\nat i P.

Aler, '16<br />\n<br />\nSir\u2014I should like to offer a suggestion with regard to the cheering<br />\nat the football games. The cheering Saturday was not at all up to<br />\nstandard. More practice and better<br />\nco-operation between students and<br />\ncheer leader are immediately necessary if we are to give the team the<br />\nbest of support.<br />\nThe rooting stand at Homewood<br />\nshould he heard from during the<br />\nentire game and the cheering should<br />\nbe done with more finish than it is<br />\nat present. As matters stood at<br />\nSaturday's game, the singing was<br />\nscarcely heard in the adjoining<br />\nstands. With a band to lead in this<br />\nbranch of the rooting and a large<br />\nnumber of students such as that<br />\npresent at Saturday's game, the<br />\nsinging ought to ring out with a<br />\nvim characteristic of a body of<br />\nspirited college men.<br />\nThe cheering Saturday was done<br />\nwith a good show of spirit for the<br />\nmost part, but it showed deplorable<br />\nlack of practice. A good, snappy<br />\nyell is a difficult thing to master,<br />\nand much practice is necessary.<br />\nOnce the yells are mastered, the inspiration gained through the feeling of success serves to heighten<br />\nthe spirit of the cheering sections<br />\nand gives the yells that indescribable something we are prone to call<br />\nthe \"proper spirit.\"<br />\nIt is possible to make our cheering as uniform as that of any college. Let's get together often under<br />\na good cheer leader and show Brickley and the team what can be done<br />\nwith the old Hopkins yells and<br />\nJUNIOR.<br />\nsongs.<br />\n<br />\nY. M. C.

Of all the big<br />\nschools in the Golden State, Leland<br />\nStanford alone has stood firm for<br />\nthe imported game.<br />\nRecently the University of California refused an invitation from<br />\nStanford to participate in a series<br />\nof football exhibitions, to compare<br />\nthe relative merits of the two<br />\ngames. The refusal was based on<br />\nthe grounds that the practice games<br />\nthen being played on the respective<br />\ncampuses offered sufficient opportunity for comparison.<br />\nAccording to Manager Warren<br />\nBovard, of the University of Southern California, the schools and colleges in the South should co-operate<br />\nwith the University-of California<br />\nto bring the American game into<br />\nits own over the whole State. He<br />\nblames the teams of the Southern<br />\nConference for not endeavoring to<br />\narrange their schedules in such a<br />\nway that the University of California could have played Pomona<br />\nor Occidental.<br />\nTo better understand the cause<br />\nfor the present football situation in<br />\nCalifornia and to judge the stand<br />\nLeland Stanford has taken for<br />\nRugby, it is necessary to know<br />\nsomething of the history of Rugby<br />\nin California.<br />\nIn 1906, Stanford and the University of California decided that<br />\nthe American game was too rough,<br />\nand accordingly took up Rugby.<br />\nNumerous high schools and colleges in the southern part of the<br />\nState followed the lead of these two<br />\nbig institutions and also adopted it.<br />\nSoon almost every school in the<br />\notate was playing the new game.<br />\nHowever, because the athletes<br />\ntook no particular trouble to train<br />\nfor the game or learn its fine points<br />\nthe game degenerated into mere<br />\nrough-house playing, in which the<br />\nhuskiest and toughest team won.<br />\nIn time, public sentiment was<br />\nawakened by this kind of play and<br />\ndisapproval was expressed by the<br />\nfalling off of attendance at games.<br />\nThen a demand was made for the<br />\nreinstatement of the American<br />\ngame.<br />\nFour more high schools Eureka, Etna Mills, Redding and Ashland\u2014of California have decided to<br />\ntake up the American game ill<br />\npreference to Rugby. With these<br />\nhigh schools in the northern part<br />\nof the State switching to the American game, a landslide is predicted<br />\nfor the remainder of the schools.<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n*<br />\n<br />\n(Continued from page I)<br />\n<br />\nhard but clean football.

BRICKLEY,<br /><br />\nThe fortieth academic year began<br />\nlast Tuesday, October 5, with the<br />\nadmission of 127 new students to<br />\nthe undergraduate department of<br />\nthe University. Dean Murray P.<br />\nBrush, formerly collegiate professor of French, met the entering students, both academic and engineering, in the Donovan Room the day<br />\npreceding. Following his address,<br />\nshort talks were given by Hiram<br />\nWoodward, of the Student Council,<br />\nand Captain Primrose, of the football team.<br />\nThere was no \"hazing\" again this<br />\nyear. The freshmen\u2022 regulations,<br />\nhowever, were inaugurated with<br />\nsuccess. Every freshman may now<br />\nbe seen wearing a small white button adorned with a conspicuous<br />\nletter \"F\" in green. These are provided by the Student Council and<br />\nare on sale at the postoffice. Freshmen are prohibited from wearing<br />\nhats or riding in the elevator in the<br />\nUniversity buildings.<br />\nSince last year there have been<br />\nmany changes in the University<br />\nfaculty. The loss of Dr. Gildersleeve and Dean Griffin has been<br />\nkeenly felt. Dr. Griffin, who for<br />\ntwenty-six years was dean of the<br />\ncollegiate faculty, has been succeeded by Dr. Brush, while his<br />\nclasses in philosophy will be conducted by Prof. Slonimsky,formerly<br />\nof Columbia. Dean Brush will continue to teach some of his classes<br />\nin French. Dr. J. D.

Goodnow returned to the University Monday<br />\nmorning after an absence of several<br />\nmonths in China, where he is constitutional adviser to the republic.<br />\nDuring his stay in China Dr.<br />\nGoodnow was much concerned with<br />\nthe question as to whether the monarchial form of government is better for China than a republic. Upon<br />\nbeing asked to pass upon the question, he answered that in view of<br />\nthe present state of China and considering its traditions a constitutional monarchy would perhaps be<br />\nthe better form. He added, however, that to go back to the old form<br />\nof absolute monarchy would be a<br />\nstep backward. He has not ceased<br />\nto believe in popular government.<br />\nDr. Goodnow stated upon his arrival that, although he was not prepared to discuss the affairs of the<br />\nUniversity at the time, he was inclined to favor the idea of introducing military training into the life of<br />\nthe undergraduates, according to<br />\nthe suggestion made by members of<br />\nthe Alumni Association.<br />\nUpon being asked whether- he<br />\nwould accept the position of chairman of the commission recently appointed to take up the problem of<br />\nabolishing useless State offices and<br />\nworking economy in the State of<br />\nMaryland, he stated that he was not<br />\nable to say definitely what he would<br />\ndo. He declared himself in sympathy with the idea, but added that<br />\nsince he was not familiar with the<br />\nwork of the commission he was undecided as to what to do.<br />\nIn Dr. Goodnow's party and returning with him were Mrs. Goodnow; their daughter, Miss Lois<br />\nGoodnow; their neices, the Misses<br />\nEleanor Goodnow and Dorothy<br />\nBigelow; Dr. W.

Whatever<br />\nI may say concerns the Hopkins<br />\nsquad as a whole.<br />\nThe game on Saturday was, as<br />\nmight be expected of a first game,<br />\na very crude affair, but it served to<br />\ngive Mr. Brennick and myself a<br />\nline on the playing abilities of the<br />\nmen. Many a man is apt to do well<br />\nin scrimmage and then fall down<br />\nin an actual game, and vice versa.<br />\nI will say for the men Saturday that<br />\nnearly every one performed better<br />\nin the game than in the practice<br />\nscrimmages.<br />\nThe. men were sent into the game<br />\nwith very few plays, but with what<br />\nI thought was a good defense. In<br />\nmy opinion, a team must get a good<br />\ndefense first of all. If you have a<br />\ngood defense, the other fellow cannot beat you, even though you don't<br />\ndefeat him.<br />\nI was much pleased with the Hopkins kicking department on Saturday. The drop-kicking, place-kicking and kick-offs were very well<br />\nexecuted\u2014much better than I had<br />\nexpected. As to the punting, there<br />\nwere not enough punts made by<br />\nHopkins to be able to pass judgment upon.<br />\nThe work of the line was good<br />\nin spots, but of course the men did<br />\nnot begin to have the team-play<br />\nwhich will come with their development in football knowledge. Although it may not have seemed so<br />\nto the spectators, the line was much<br />\nbetter defensively than on offense.<br />\nNext Saturday's game should show<br />\na distinct improvement in the offensive work of the Hopkins line.<br />\nThe backfield men played well<br />\nas individuals, but team-work was<br />\nlacking here as in the line. The<br />\ninterference was for the most part<br />\ncrude and ineffective, as the men<br />\nahead of the runner with the ball<br />\ndid not move fast enough to get out<br />\nof his way.<br />\nWhat really pleased me most on<br />\nSaturday was the spirit of the Hopkins men, both on the field and in<br />\nthe stands.

The meeting will<br />\nbe attended by members of last<br />\nyear's clubs only.<br />\nAlthough the election of officers<br />\nfor this year took place at the end<br />\nof last year, two vacancies on the<br />\nBoard of Managers have been created through the failure of two of<br />\nthe elected members to return to<br />\nthe University this fall. These<br />\nvacancies will be filled at the earliest possible opportunity. The loss<br />\nof Leader Geissel, of the Instrumental Club, who has accepted a<br />\nposition in the West, will be felt<br />\nmost keenly, and the remaining<br />\nmembers of the Board have a<br />\nserious problem before them in the<br />\nselection of a new leader. At a<br />\nmeeting of the Board which was<br />\nheld Friday, E. M. Spieker, '16,<br />\nwas appointed as temporary coach<br />\nof the Instrumental Club, to hold<br />\noffice until a satisfactory leader can<br />\nbe selected.<br />\nWith the advent of new material<br />\nfrom the incoming class, and with<br />\nthe advantage of a firm financial<br />\nfooting, the prospects for the season are very good. Negotiations<br />\nfor a number of trips are under<br />\nconsideration and several town<br />\nconcerts have been arranged. Work<br />\non both clubs will begin immediately, and with good progress the<br />\nleaders hope to be able to open the<br />\nseason shortly before the Christmas vacation.<br />\nThe system of governing the<br />\nclubs by a board of managers,<br />\nwhich was instituted at the beginning of last year, has been carried<br />\nout with much success; now that<br />\nthe ground in the new field has<br />\nbeen broken by a year's work of<br />\nthe Board, the clubs are in excellent shape to go ahead under the<br />\nnew rules. The affairs of the<br />\nclubs promise to run very smoothly<br />\nfrom now on.<br />\nA meeting at which candidates<br />\nfor the clubs are to report will be<br />\nheld in McCoy Hall on Wednesday<br />\nat i P.

Aler, '16<br /><br />\nSir\u2014I should like to offer a suggestion with regard to the cheering<br />\nat the football games. The cheering Saturday was not at all up to<br />\nstandard. More practice and better<br />\nco-operation between students and<br />\ncheer leader are immediately necessary if we are to give the team the<br />\nbest of support.<br />\nThe rooting stand at Homewood<br />\nshould he heard from during the<br />\nentire game and the cheering should<br />\nbe done with more finish than it is<br />\nat present. As matters stood at<br />\nSaturday's game, the singing was<br />\nscarcely heard in the adjoining<br />\nstands. With a band to lead in this<br />\nbranch of the rooting and a large<br />\nnumber of students such as that<br />\npresent at Saturday's game, the<br />\nsinging ought to ring out with a<br />\nvim characteristic of a body of<br />\nspirited college men.<br />\nThe cheering Saturday was done<br />\nwith a good show of spirit for the<br />\nmost part, but it showed deplorable<br />\nlack of practice. A good, snappy<br />\nyell is a difficult thing to master,<br />\nand much practice is necessary.<br />\nOnce the yells are mastered, the inspiration gained through the feeling of success serves to heighten<br />\nthe spirit of the cheering sections<br />\nand gives the yells that indescribable something we are prone to call<br />\nthe \"proper spirit.\"<br />\nIt is possible to make our cheering as uniform as that of any college.

Of all the big<br />\nschools in the Golden State, Leland<br />\nStanford alone has stood firm for<br />\nthe imported game.<br />\nRecently the University of California refused an invitation from<br />\nStanford to participate in a series<br />\nof football exhibitions, to compare<br />\nthe relative merits of the two<br />\ngames. The refusal was based on<br />\nthe grounds that the practice games<br />\nthen being played on the respective<br />\ncampuses offered sufficient opportunity for comparison.<br />\nAccording to Manager Warren<br />\nBovard, of the University of Southern California, the schools and colleges in the South should co-operate<br />\nwith the University-of California<br />\nto bring the American game into<br />\nits own over the whole State. He<br />\nblames the teams of the Southern<br />\nConference for not endeavoring to<br />\narrange their schedules in such a<br />\nway that the University of California could have played Pomona<br />\nor Occidental.<br />\nTo better understand the cause<br />\nfor the present football situation in<br />\nCalifornia and to judge the stand<br />\nLeland Stanford has taken for<br />\nRugby, it is necessary to know<br />\nsomething of the history of Rugby<br />\nin California.<br />\nIn 1906, Stanford and the University of California decided that<br />\nthe American game was too rough,<br />\nand accordingly took up Rugby.<br />\nNumerous high schools and colleges in the southern part of the<br />\nState followed the lead of these two<br />\nbig institutions and also adopted it.<br />\nSoon almost every school in the<br />\notate was playing the new game.<br />\nHowever, because the athletes<br />\ntook no particular trouble to train<br />\nfor the game or learn its fine points<br />\nthe game degenerated into mere<br />\nrough-house playing, in which the<br />\nhuskiest and toughest team won.<br />\nIn time, public sentiment was<br />\nawakened by this kind of play and<br />\ndisapproval was expressed by the<br />\nfalling off of attendance at games.<br />\nThen a demand was made for the<br />\nreinstatement of the American<br />\ngame.<br />\nFour more high schools Eureka, Etna Mills, Redding and Ashland\u2014of California have decided to<br />\ntake up the American game ill<br />\npreference to Rugby. With these<br />\nhigh schools in the northern part<br />\nof the State switching to the American game, a landslide is predicted<br />\nfor the remainder of the schools.<br />\n*<br /><br />\n*<br /><br />\n(Continued from page I)<br /><br />\nhard but clean football.
