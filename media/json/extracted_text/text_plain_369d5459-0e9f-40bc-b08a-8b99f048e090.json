Although the ode<br />\nwill not be specifically about<br />\nHopkins, I do think he accepted<br />\nthe commission in order to honor<br />\nhis alma mater.

Certainly, there is no<br />\nhonor for the United States in the<br />\nrole it continues to play in<br />\nIndochina. Because there are no<br />\nlonger U.S. soldiers and pilots in<br />\nIndochina, it is easy to overlook<br />\nthe more devious form of support<br />\nthe United States now provides to<br />\nthe Thieu and Lon Nol regimes.<br />\nIn the first year of the<br />\n\"cease-fire\" over 80,000<br />\nVietnamese were killed in the<br />\nwar-more than the total number<br />\nof Americans killed in a decade of<br />\ncombat (Senate Subcommittee on<br />\nRefugees, January 27, 1974). The<br />\nwar rages on today because the<br />\nUnited States continues to fund<br />\n85% of the costs of the Thieu and<br />\nLon Nol regimes.<br />\nThis year alone, the<br />\nAdministration is spending over 21<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nbillion dollars for direct assistance<br />\nto the military governments in<br />\nSouth Viet Nam and Cambodia.<br />\nSenator Alan Cranston of<br />\nCalifornia described what this<br />\nmoney was being used for last<br />\nMarch 19 before the Senate Armed<br />\nServices committee:<br />\n\"We are subsidizing systematic<br />\nkilling, torture, and imprisonment<br />\nwith money that rightfully belongs<br />\nto our cities, our poor, and our<br />\n<br />\nlost<br />\nRuth Read will resign her post as director of Student<br />\nEmployment effective Friday, much to the disappointment<br />\nof students who had appreciated the affection and concern<br />\nwith which she had run her office. It is no secret that tension<br />\nbetween Read and Academic Services administrators<br />\ncontributed to some degree to her decision to leave, despite<br />\nher gracious claim that the decision was \"entirely her own.\"<br />\nWe arc reminded immediately of the departure earlier this<br />\nsemester of Rubie Harris of the Admissions Office, who<br />\nlikewise spoke of a tension with administrative bigwigs and<br />\nwho was also acclaimed by students for the warmth with<br />\nwhich she discharged her duties. Though the names may<br />\nchange the situation seems to be the same \u2014 the Academic<br />\nServices administration does not seem able to tolerate<br />\nemployees who enjoy a close rapport with students, which<br />\neven Academic Services Director Larry Denton acknowledges<br />\nis in short supply here.<br />\nThough employees like Ruth Read, Rubie Harris, and<br />\nothers in the Homewood Student Services may operate in a<br />\nway incompatible with the professional philosophy of the<br />\nadministration, they should not be the victims of tension, nor<br />\nshould their efforts have to be discredited by departure.<br />\nThe current Academic Services structure appears<br />\ninsensitive to the methods of employees whose primary<br />\nconcern is the welfare of the students they are employed to<br />\nserve. Though the inclusion of such extraordinary employees<br />\nmay require some tolerance and some bending in the<br />\nheirarchy, it would be worth the benefit which students<br />\nwould receive.<br />\n<br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe are graduate students and<br />\nprofessors who are seriously<br />\nconcerned about study conditions<br />\nin the library, especially, although<br />\nnot exclusively, in the evenings.<br />\nThe noise of conversation on<br />\nD-Level and in the Graduate<br />\nReserve Room makes serious work<br />\nand study impossible. D-Level is<br />\nparticularly bad- so much so that<br />\nmost of us have abandoned the<br />\nlibrary as a place to work. Some of<br />\nus, however, have no other place to<br />\nstudy, and even those who can<br />\nwork, elsewhere must be able to use<br />\nwzyvaAN<br />\n//iiteri<br />\n'<br />\nW-'fire\u2014keire7-bW<br />\n<br />\nsexually active so I'm not quite<br />\nsure what the women who<br />\ncomplained had to fear (or reveal)<br />\nby giving their names.

This is in<br />\nclear violation of the Paris Peace<br />\nAgreements. The Agreement<br />\ncontains a public and legally<br />\nbinding committment by the<br />\nUnited States to end all forms of<br />\nintervention in Viet Nam in return<br />\nfor the release of the POW's thus:<br />\npermitting the Vietnamese in<br />\nSouth Vietnam to engage in a<br />\npolitical competition for power<br />\nbased on a military cease-fire.<br />\nInstead the United States has<br />\ncontinued to support one faction<br />\nin South Viet Nam with massive<br />\nfunding, arms, ammunition,<br />\naircraft, and advisors. Although<br />\nGraham Martin, U.S. Ambassador<br />\nto Saigon, said last June that \"our<br />\nintention all along was to balance<br />\nthe aid given by the Soviet Union<br />\nand the People's Repbulic of China<br />\nto North Viet Nam,\" in fact, our<br />\naid to Southeast Asia is twenty-five<br />\ntimes that given by China and the<br />\nSoviet Union combined (U.S.<br />\nDefense Intelligence Agency<br />\nfigures).<br />\nOver and above the military aid<br />\nis the \"economic\" aid such as<br />\nFood for Peace and Commercial<br />\nImport Program, usually thought<br />\nof as the constructive side of<br />\nforeign aid. But through indirect<br />\nchannels, the \"economic\" aid buys<br />\nmore \\mar and repression for the,<br />\nVietnamese people. This year<br />\nSaigon receives 176 million dollars<br />\nfrom Food for Peace. The U.S.<br />\nDepartment of Agriculture \"buys<br />\nsurplus American-grown rice with<br />\ndollars, ships it to South Viet Nam<br />\nand sells it to the Vietnamese<br />\nimporters for piasters. 80% of the<br />\npiasters are deposited in a South<br />\nVietnamese Government bank<br />\naccount and spent exclusively for<br />\nmilitary purposes.\" (NYT,<br />\n<br />\nLooseleaf paper: In Follett's<br />\nJHU Bookstore one can buy a<br />\npackage of 100 sheets of looseleaf<br />\npaper for $1.20 (1.2 cents per<br />\nsheet) or. $1.25 (1.25 cents per<br />\npage), or a package of 200 sheets<br />\nfor S1.69 (.845 cents per page).<br />\nThis is for narrow rule, as, that is<br />\nthe only kind of looseleaf paper<br />\nsold there.

It sounded as if they had<br />\nstayed away because there was no<br />\n-certified gynecologist present.\"<br />\nI think the real problem is the<br />\ntitle \"midwife.\" It is a holdover<br />\nfrom the Middle Ages and does not<br />\ndescribe what a nurse midwife is<br />\ncapable of today.

Their 65 cent sticker<br />\ncovers the manufacturer's 50 cent<br />\nprice.<br />\nAlthough these are only the<br />\nitems I checked, ,others have told<br />\nme of things that cost less at stores<br />\nother than the Bookstore.

I also feel that<br />\nthe University should have some<br />\ncontrol over the prices in the<br />\nBookstore.<br />\nIn the meantime, I urge<br />\neveryone to stop buying at<br />\nFollett's.

After explaining<br />\nour feelings to the \"bouncer\" we<br />\npromptly walked by him despite<br />\nhis dissatisfaction.

The largest<br />\nindividual increases within the<br />\narea departemtn have been in<br />\nBiology, Chemistry and the<br />\nNatural Science Area major.<br />\nThe most significant decrease<br />\nIn area enrollment has been in<br />\nthe Humanities with a percentage<br />\ndrop from 15.6% in 1970 to<br />\n9.8% in 1974. The number of<br />\nstudents majoring in Engineering<br />\nScience has also dropped by<br />\nalmost half from 10.8% to 5.9%.<br />\nStatistics indicate that<br />\nenrollment in Quantitative<br />\nStudies and Social and Behavioral<br />\nSciences has fluctuated only<br />\nslightly with decreases of .1% and<br />\n1% respectively<br />\nAnother category examined by<br />\nthe study included those students<br />\nwho had not yet decided upon a<br />\nMajor field of study.

Says<br />\nThomas, \"Such a study doesn't<br />\n<br />\nshow anything from an<br />\nadmissions standpoint.

Some officials also stated<br />\nthat the position of federal<br />\nenergy administrator held too<br />\nmuch power.<br />\nSubscribing to a<br />\nconservationalist view, Sawhill<br />\nwas a strong proponent of<br />\nincreasing federal gasoline taxes.<br />\nHe further proposed mandatory<br />\nmeasures to limit automobile<br />\ntravel and tax credits for<br />\nhomeowners who install<br />\ninsulation and storm windows to<br />\nconserve heat.<br />\nThroughout his career in the<br />\ngovernment, Sawhill has been an<br />\n<br />\nadvocate of consumer affairs and<br />\nthe small businessman, and a<br />\ncritic of corporate business.<br />\nA native of Baltimore, Sawhill<br />\nreceived his Ph.D. in economics,<br />\nfinance, and management from<br />\nNew York University.

And under the patient guidance of our expertly trained<br />\ninstructors, you learn at your own pace.<br />\nStarting with your first lesson after breakfast, by<br />\nlunchtime, you'll be skiing down our wide, gentle slopes<br />\nand loving every minute of it. We promise. Best of all, a<br />\nLearn to Ski vacation at Snowshoe is one thing the whole<br />\nfamily can enjoy doing together.<br />\nWell, what are you waiting for.

Zowie! You're.on the glory trail.<br />\nBest of all, Snowshoe has more snow than any other<br />\nresort in the region. Our average annual fall is 180 inches<br />\n(National Weather Service Data) and if Mother Nature skimps<br />\na little, we've got a snowmaking system that won't quit.<br />\nIt makes an acre of snow 12 inches deep, every hour. And at<br />\nSnowshoe, the temperatures are cold enough to hold it.<br />\nBy the way, when you're at Snowshoe, if you see<br />\nanybody who looks like Jean-Claude Killy, it's Jean-Claude<br />\nKilly.

DU<br />\nwas declared the winner by a margin of<br />\n6-0, but the game was heatedly protested<br />\nby, the Wilson-Wood team. I am sorry to<br />\nsaythat I attended both the game, and the<br />\nprotest hearing before the BIA board.<br />\nThe facts protested by Wilson-Wood<br />\nwere:only one official showed for the<br />\ngame, while two officials are required by<br />\nBIA rules; three times Wilson-Wood<br />\nscored what seemed to everyone on the<br />\nsidelines as clearcut touchdowns, except<br />\nfor the official, who nullified all three;<br />\nDU blatantly tackled Wilson-Wood<br />\nrunners on several occasions, no call being<br />\nmade by the official; the official<br />\nfrequently made the line of scrimmage<br />\nfavorable to DU; the official totally<br />\nignored BIA regulations requiring him to<br />\nrecord all protests, at the time of the<br />\nprotest.<br />\nBored Board<br />\nThe BIA board met last Friday,<br />\nstarting off with other BIA business<br />\nbefore getting to the Wilson-Wood case. A<br />\nreport was given dealing with other recent<br />\nBIA events. The interesting aspect of this<br />\npart of the meeting was that the board<br />\nseemed to miss the major point of this<br />\nreport, that praticipation amongst<br />\ndorminory teams was scarce. Then<br />\nWilson-Wood was given the opportunity<br />\nto present its protest. The case as a whole<br />\n<br />\nr<br />\n<br />\nwas - handled from the wrong angle.<br />\nInstead of hearing a case of Wilson-Wood<br />\nversus the official, and in fact, the BIA as<br />\na whole, they set up a case in which<br />\nWilson -Wood was fighting DU.<br />\nWilson-Wood, though, had no qualms<br />\nabout DU, and its game tactics. Their case<br />\nwas agianst the officiating, which should<br />\nhave penalized those actions. The board<br />\nsat around the J and H rooms in Levering<br />\nHall, sprawled over chairs, looking out<br />\nwindows, talking with neighbors, laughing<br />\nand jeering as Wilson-Wood presented<br />\nitself in an admirable manner. If they<br />\nwere not laughing, they were picking<br />\ntheir noses, which seems to be a favorite<br />\npasttime of the BR board. Wilson-Wood<br />\nbrought fifteen serious people to testify,<br />\nincluding an impartial _spectator from<br />\noutside the dorm. Unfortunately, they<br />\nwere wasting their time. The facts of the<br />\nmatter were that the official belongs to a<br />\nfrat, and is a member of the GIA board,<br />\nWilson-Wood was playing a frat, and<br />\ntlhree- fourths of the BIA board is made<br />\nup of frat members. No vote was going to<br />\ngo in favor of a dormitory; Wilson-Wood<br />\ntheir bid to replay the game under fairer<br />\nconditions. Wilson-Wood was wronged by<br />\na group of unethical clowns, who don't<br />\neven have the common decency to<br />\nuphold their own rules. Wilson -Wood<br />\nwas cheated out of a game they rightfully<br />\nwon, and then cheated out of a fair<br />\nhearing by a biased boarded board of<br />\nnose-pickers.<br />\n<br />\nSomething must be done about the<br />\nBIA. There is little structure in the<br />\npresent set-up of BIA activities, and<br />\nconsequently little participation. This is<br />\nespecially evident in the dormitories,<br />\nThey are not represented on the BIA<br />\nbpard. No _representation has led to no<br />\nparticipation. This is a competitive<br />\nschool; why can't intramurals become a<br />\npart of that competition? The<br />\ndormitories must either be equally<br />\nrepresented on the BIA board, or they<br />\nshould form their own intramural<br />\ncompetition, separate from the<br />\nfraternities. This could be accomplished<br />\nby the halving of funds now allocated to<br />\nthe BIA by the Athletic Center. The best<br />\n<br />\nalternative would be to restructure the<br />\nBIA, however. Colonel Serena, Bob Scott,<br />\nsomeone must help in this restructuring.<br />\nThe honor code has undergone much<br />\ncriticism lately in regard to academic<br />\naffairs. Here is another example of<br />\ndishonorable actions at Hopkins, the BIA<br />\nruling in the Wilson- Wood case. The BIA<br />\ntreats intramurals as a joke; they operate<br />\nin a half-assed way;in actuality the board<br />\nitself is a joke. Intramural activities, and<br />\nthe direction and organization of them:<br />\nconsiderable work in these areas is<br />\nneeded, if the BIA is to become a<br />\nreasonably fair and healthy competitive<br />\norganization for the benefit of all<br />\nstudents on this campus.<br />\n<br />\n***********************************************<br />\n<br />\nCHAPLAIN'S AUCTION<br />\n<br />\n41(<br />\n<br />\nO<br />\n<br />\nItems from 11:30 til 1:30<br />\nA2.

Washington showed<br />\nlittle spark on offense or defense,<br />\nand didn't look capable of<br />\nrouting the ays.<br />\nBut, according to co-captain<br />\nCharles Gilman, \"After they got<br />\nthe early lead, they just played<br />\nlike they wanted it more than we<br />\ndid.\" Indeed there was more at<br />\nstake for the Shoremen at 1:43<br />\ninto the opening stanza..

The<br />\npoint-after attempt failed, and at<br />\nthe end of three quarters,<br />\nSwarthmore led 13-6.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays finest hour<br />\nwas yet to come. In their best<br />\nquarter of the season, Coach<br />\nDennis Cox's charges struck for<br />\nthree touchdowns while holding<br />\nthe Garnets to a single tally and<br />\nthus achieving a brilliant<br />\ncome-from-behind victory.

In<br />\nthis \"special\" form, the HAC<br />\nwould have had more extensive<br />\npowers than other Homewood<br />\ncommittees.<br />\nBenton stated that the<br />\nproposal for the establishment or<br />\nthe HAC in this \"special\" form<br />\nwas presented to undergraduates,<br />\ngraduate and faculty members<br />\nfor ratification in a referendum<br />\nin the spring of 1971.<br /><br />\n\"I should like to take this<br />\nopportunity to correct what I<br />\nbelieve to be a myth which has<br />\nlong been assumed to be one of<br />\nthose law.s ot nature,\" Montagu<br />\nnoted. \"This is the impression<br />\ngenerally given that the male's<br />\nrole as economic provider in<br />\nearly human as well as in later<br />\nfood-gathering societies was by<br />\nfar the most important one.\"<br />\nAddressing this notion, he<br /><br />\nAshley Montagu<br /><br />\nstated, \"I don't believe it for a<br />\nmoment.\"<br />\nHe adduced examples of<br />\nadvances, attributed expressly to<br />\nwomen, as an argument in<br />\nsupport of a change in societal<br />\nnotions of sex roles. \"Most<br />\narcheological and anthropologists<br />\nagree that the first major<br />\nindustrial revolution in the<br />\nhistory of the human species was<br />\nthe discovery of agriculture, and<br />\nthat this was a discovery made by<br />\nwomen,\" he said.<br />\n\"I would myself call this the<br />\nthird major industrial revolution,<br />\nfor it arrived quite late in the,<br />\nhistory of man's cultural<br />\ndevelopment-somefifteen<br />\nthousand years ago,\" he<br />\ncontinued.<br />\n\"I would call the first<br />\nindustrial revolution the<br />\ndiscovery of toolmaking upon<br />\nwhich the species became<br />\ncontinuously dependant for its<br />\nsurvival.

The are publicicty<br />\ncosts to consider, and details<br />\nsuch as the rental of grand piano.<br />\nOne must also remember that<br />\ninflation has caused all of these<br />\nindividual costs to rise, resulting<br />\nin an overall increase.\".<br />\nEllery Woodworth, member of<br />\nthe Executive Committee of the<br />\nCentennial Board, explained that<br />\nthe projected cost increase was<br />\ndue mainly to a change in the<br /><br />\nconcert program's structure.<br />\n\"When the idea was conceived<br />\nabout two years ago, the original<br />\nplan was to have the orchestra<br />\nperform pieces from their<br />\nstandard repertoire, which would<br />\nhave cost $7,500. Later, the<br />\ndecision, was made to commission<br />\nHopkins alumnus Hugo Weisgal<br />\nto create an original composition<br />\nhonorin As a rule, an<br />\nexperienced orchestra normally<br />\nrequires only one rehearsal to<br />\nlearn a new piece. Woodworth<br />\nstated that Weisgal has<br />\nspecifically requested several<br />\nrehearsals, which is the major<br />\nfactor contributing to the cost<br />\nincrease.<br />\n\"Hugo Weisgal is a well-know<br />\ncomposer, and is the only<br />\nHopkins alumnus of any stature<br />\nin the field. Although the ode<br />\nwill not be specifically about<br />\nHopkins, I do think he accepted<br />\nthe commission in order to honor<br />\nhis alma mater. His request for<br />\nthe rehearsals is not intemded to<br />\nincrease production costs, but to<br /><br />\ninsure a good performance.\"<br />\nWoodworth emphasized that<br />\nWeisgal has been commissioned<br />\nfor a fixed fee, which has not<br />\nincreased since the original<br />\nagreement.<br />\n\"We anticipate raising all of<br />\nthe funds for the concert through<br />\nticket sales, contributions from<br />\nsponsors, and by other means.<br />\nNone of the money will come<br />\nout of general University<br />\nfunds\",concluded Woodworth.<br /><br />\nFerdinand Hamburger<br /><br />\nRide Service resumes activity<br />\nBy LAINY STEPHANS<br />\nThe Student Council's Ride<br />\nService, which provides<br />\ninformation for students<br />\nrequiring and offering rides, will<br />\nbegin this week.<br />\nSenior Class Representative<br />\nAndy Fredman announced that<br />\nbeginning Friday, students can<br />\ncall into the Student Council<br />\noffice and leave their information<br /><br />\nHOPKINS UNION ARTS &amp; CRAFTS<br />\nEXHIBITION &amp; SALE<br />\nAll Hopkins Community Members are invited<br />\nto exhibit and sell their arts &amp; crafts.<br />\nfor more information .<br />\nPlease call Tim Oldfield, 235 - 0074<br /><br />\nwith an automatic<br />\ntelephone-answering device.<br />\n\"Last year, we used<br />\nwork-study people to answer the<br />\nphones and collate the calls, but<br />\nit was too expensive.

Certainly, there is no<br />\nhonor for the United States in the<br />\nrole it continues to play in<br />\nIndochina. Because there are no<br />\nlonger U.S. soldiers and pilots in<br />\nIndochina, it is easy to overlook<br />\nthe more devious form of support<br />\nthe United States now provides to<br />\nthe Thieu and Lon Nol regimes.<br />\nIn the first year of the<br />\n\"cease-fire\" over 80,000<br />\nVietnamese were killed in the<br />\nwar-more than the total number<br />\nof Americans killed in a decade of<br />\ncombat (Senate Subcommittee on<br />\nRefugees, January 27, 1974). The<br />\nwar rages on today because the<br />\nUnited States continues to fund<br />\n85% of the costs of the Thieu and<br />\nLon Nol regimes.<br />\nThis year alone, the<br />\nAdministration is spending over 21<br />\n/<br />\n2<br />\nbillion dollars for direct assistance<br />\nto the military governments in<br />\nSouth Viet Nam and Cambodia.<br />\nSenator Alan Cranston of<br />\nCalifornia described what this<br />\nmoney was being used for last<br />\nMarch 19 before the Senate Armed<br />\nServices committee:<br />\n\"We are subsidizing systematic<br />\nkilling, torture, and imprisonment<br />\nwith money that rightfully belongs<br />\nto our cities, our poor, and our<br /><br />\nlost<br />\nRuth Read will resign her post as director of Student<br />\nEmployment effective Friday, much to the disappointment<br />\nof students who had appreciated the affection and concern<br />\nwith which she had run her office. It is no secret that tension<br />\nbetween Read and Academic Services administrators<br />\ncontributed to some degree to her decision to leave, despite<br />\nher gracious claim that the decision was \"entirely her own.\"<br />\nWe arc reminded immediately of the departure earlier this<br />\nsemester of Rubie Harris of the Admissions Office, who<br />\nlikewise spoke of a tension with administrative bigwigs and<br />\nwho was also acclaimed by students for the warmth with<br />\nwhich she discharged her duties. Though the names may<br />\nchange the situation seems to be the same \u2014 the Academic<br />\nServices administration does not seem able to tolerate<br />\nemployees who enjoy a close rapport with students, which<br />\neven Academic Services Director Larry Denton acknowledges<br />\nis in short supply here.<br />\nThough employees like Ruth Read, Rubie Harris, and<br />\nothers in the Homewood Student Services may operate in a<br />\nway incompatible with the professional philosophy of the<br />\nadministration, they should not be the victims of tension, nor<br />\nshould their efforts have to be discredited by departure.<br />\nThe current Academic Services structure appears<br />\ninsensitive to the methods of employees whose primary<br />\nconcern is the welfare of the students they are employed to<br />\nserve. Though the inclusion of such extraordinary employees<br />\nmay require some tolerance and some bending in the<br />\nheirarchy, it would be worth the benefit which students<br />\nwould receive.<br /><br />\nletters to the editor<br />\nTo the Editor:<br />\nWe are graduate students and<br />\nprofessors who are seriously<br />\nconcerned about study conditions<br />\nin the library, especially, although<br />\nnot exclusively, in the evenings.<br />\nThe noise of conversation on<br />\nD-Level and in the Graduate<br />\nReserve Room makes serious work<br />\nand study impossible. D-Level is<br />\nparticularly bad- so much so that<br />\nmost of us have abandoned the<br />\nlibrary as a place to work.

This is in<br />\nclear violation of the Paris Peace<br />\nAgreements. The Agreement<br />\ncontains a public and legally<br />\nbinding committment by the<br />\nUnited States to end all forms of<br />\nintervention in Viet Nam in return<br />\nfor the release of the POW's thus:<br />\npermitting the Vietnamese in<br />\nSouth Vietnam to engage in a<br />\npolitical competition for power<br />\nbased on a military cease-fire.<br />\nInstead the United States has<br />\ncontinued to support one faction<br />\nin South Viet Nam with massive<br />\nfunding, arms, ammunition,<br />\naircraft, and advisors. Although<br />\nGraham Martin, U.S. Ambassador<br />\nto Saigon, said last June that \"our<br />\nintention all along was to balance<br />\nthe aid given by the Soviet Union<br />\nand the People's Repbulic of China<br />\nto North Viet Nam,\" in fact, our<br />\naid to Southeast Asia is twenty-five<br />\ntimes that given by China and the<br />\nSoviet Union combined (U.S.<br />\nDefense Intelligence Agency<br />\nfigures).<br />\nOver and above the military aid<br />\nis the \"economic\" aid such as<br />\nFood for Peace and Commercial<br />\nImport Program, usually thought<br />\nof as the constructive side of<br />\nforeign aid. But through indirect<br />\nchannels, the \"economic\" aid buys<br />\nmore \\mar and repression for the,<br />\nVietnamese people.

DU<br />\nwas declared the winner by a margin of<br />\n6-0, but the game was heatedly protested<br />\nby, the Wilson-Wood team. I am sorry to<br />\nsaythat I attended both the game, and the<br />\nprotest hearing before the BIA board.<br />\nThe facts protested by Wilson-Wood<br />\nwere:only one official showed for the<br />\ngame, while two officials are required by<br />\nBIA rules; three times Wilson-Wood<br />\nscored what seemed to everyone on the<br />\nsidelines as clearcut touchdowns, except<br />\nfor the official, who nullified all three;<br />\nDU blatantly tackled Wilson-Wood<br />\nrunners on several occasions, no call being<br />\nmade by the official; the official<br />\nfrequently made the line of scrimmage<br />\nfavorable to DU; the official totally<br />\nignored BIA regulations requiring him to<br />\nrecord all protests, at the time of the<br />\nprotest.<br />\nBored Board<br />\nThe BIA board met last Friday,<br />\nstarting off with other BIA business<br />\nbefore getting to the Wilson-Wood case. A<br />\nreport was given dealing with other recent<br />\nBIA events. The interesting aspect of this<br />\npart of the meeting was that the board<br />\nseemed to miss the major point of this<br />\nreport, that praticipation amongst<br />\ndorminory teams was scarce. Then<br />\nWilson-Wood was given the opportunity<br />\nto present its protest. The case as a whole<br /><br />\nr<br /><br />\nwas - handled from the wrong angle.<br />\nInstead of hearing a case of Wilson-Wood<br />\nversus the official, and in fact, the BIA as<br />\na whole, they set up a case in which<br />\nWilson -Wood was fighting DU.<br />\nWilson-Wood, though, had no qualms<br />\nabout DU, and its game tactics. Their case<br />\nwas agianst the officiating, which should<br />\nhave penalized those actions. The board<br />\nsat around the J and H rooms in Levering<br />\nHall, sprawled over chairs, looking out<br />\nwindows, talking with neighbors, laughing<br />\nand jeering as Wilson-Wood presented<br />\nitself in an admirable manner. If they<br />\nwere not laughing, they were picking<br />\ntheir noses, which seems to be a favorite<br />\npasttime of the BR board. Wilson-Wood<br />\nbrought fifteen serious people to testify,<br />\nincluding an impartial _spectator from<br />\noutside the dorm. Unfortunately, they<br />\nwere wasting their time. The facts of the<br />\nmatter were that the official belongs to a<br />\nfrat, and is a member of the GIA board,<br />\nWilson-Wood was playing a frat, and<br />\ntlhree- fourths of the BIA board is made<br />\nup of frat members. No vote was going to<br />\ngo in favor of a dormitory; Wilson-Wood<br />\ntheir bid to replay the game under fairer<br />\nconditions. Wilson-Wood was wronged by<br />\na group of unethical clowns, who don't<br />\neven have the common decency to<br />\nuphold their own rules. Wilson -Wood<br />\nwas cheated out of a game they rightfully<br />\nwon, and then cheated out of a fair<br />\nhearing by a biased boarded board of<br />\nnose-pickers.<br /><br />\nSomething must be done about the<br />\nBIA. There is little structure in the<br />\npresent set-up of BIA activities, and<br />\nconsequently little participation. This is<br />\nespecially evident in the dormitories,<br />\nThey are not represented on the BIA<br />\nbpard. No _representation has led to no<br />\nparticipation. This is a competitive<br />\nschool; why can't intramurals become a<br />\npart of that competition? The<br />\ndormitories must either be equally<br />\nrepresented on the BIA board, or they<br />\nshould form their own intramural<br />\ncompetition, separate from the<br />\nfraternities. This could be accomplished<br />\nby the halving of funds now allocated to<br />\nthe BIA by the Athletic Center. The best<br /><br />\nalternative would be to restructure the<br />\nBIA, however. Colonel Serena, Bob Scott,<br />\nsomeone must help in this restructuring.<br />\nThe honor code has undergone much<br />\ncriticism lately in regard to academic<br />\naffairs. Here is another example of<br />\ndishonorable actions at Hopkins, the BIA<br />\nruling in the Wilson- Wood case. The BIA<br />\ntreats intramurals as a joke; they operate<br />\nin a half-assed way;in actuality the board<br />\nitself is a joke. Intramural activities, and<br />\nthe direction and organization of them:<br />\nconsiderable work in these areas is<br />\nneeded, if the BIA is to become a<br />\nreasonably fair and healthy competitive<br />\norganization for the benefit of all<br />\nstudents on this campus.<br /><br />\n***********************************************<br /><br />\nCHAPLAIN'S AUCTION<br /><br />\n41(<br /><br />\nO<br /><br />\nItems from 11:30 til 1:30<br />\nA2.

Washington showed<br />\nlittle spark on offense or defense,<br />\nand didn't look capable of<br />\nrouting the ays.<br />\nBut, according to co-captain<br />\nCharles Gilman, \"After they got<br />\nthe early lead, they just played<br />\nlike they wanted it more than we<br />\ndid.\" Indeed there was more at<br />\nstake for the Shoremen at 1:43<br />\ninto the opening stanza.. Byron's<br />\ngoal was followed by another<br />\nvisitors tally some eight minutes<br />\nlater. This strike was credited to<br />\nWashington lineman Pete Allen.<br />\nImpressive<br />\nThroughout the first half, the<br />\nBlue Jay booters were often<br />\nimpressive though that wasn't<br />\nindicated by the score.. Deep<br />\nBaker flashed his aggressive,<br />\npressing style. Joe Rutkowski<br />\nalso shone, playing with his<br />\ncharacteristic calm and control.<br />\nOther bright lights were Tom<br />\nMyrick and the tenacious<br />\ndefensive play of Gilman, in a<br /><br />\nreserve role.<br />\nWashington took the second<br />\nhalf kickoff and immediately<br />\nposed, an early threat. Thanks to<br />\nsome inspired hustle on the part<br />\nof Blue Jay deep backs Arni<br />\nCohen and co-captain Lou<br />\nPodrazik, the Shoremen found<br />\nthe Blue Jay defense sticky and<br />\npenetrated infrequently.<br />\nDefeat<br />\nYet infrequentiy, was quite<br />\nenough for the Shoremen's<br />\npurposes. Pete Allen added<br />\nanotkr. goal at 11:16 into the<br />\nperiod, and Washington lineman<br /><br />\nStew Quillman struck once again,<br />\na scant five minutes left in the<br />\ncontest, Babaturk scored the<br />\nonly Blue Jay goal on Tom<br />\nMyrick. It was the freshman's<br />\nfirst goal of the season and<br />\ncompleted the game's scoring.<br />\nThe Blue Jay booters face<br />\nWestern Mayland today in their<br />\nlast non-conference outing of the,<br />\nseason.

The<br />\npoint-after attempt failed, and at<br />\nthe end of three quarters,<br />\nSwarthmore led 13-6.<br />\nBut the Blue Jays finest hour<br />\nwas yet to come. In their best<br />\nquarter of the season, Coach<br />\nDennis Cox's charges struck for<br />\nthree touchdowns while holding<br />\nthe Garnets to a single tally and<br />\nthus achieving a brilliant<br />\ncome-from-behind victory. Jerry<br />\nFaraino, freshman running back<br />\nran 5yard for a score and the<br />\nJays added a 2 point conversion<br />\npass from Norbeck to Scott<br />\nSmith to take a 14-13 lead that<br />\nthey were never to relinquish.<br />\nHopkins increased that lead on a<br />\nnine-yard scoring jaunt by Franz<br />\nWittelsberger and an outstanding<br />\n51-yard interception TD run by<br />\nJack Coulter, completed the<br />\nscoring.<br />\nJerry Faraino was the<br />\noffensive star of the game rushing<br />\nfor 102 yards on 20 carrie<br /><br />\nHarriers finish 6th in MAC championship<br />\nBy JOHN TETZLAFF<br />\nThe Hopkins cross-country<br />\nteam travelled up to Philadelphia<br />\non Saturday to compete in the<br />\nMiddle Atlantic Conference<br />\n(MAC) championship meet, held<br />\non the Belmont Plateau course.<br />\nThe Blue Jay harriers finished<br />\n6th in a field of 20 teams,<br />\nincluding a new addition;<br />\nGettysburg, who won the met.<br />\nThe Bullet thinclads won the<br />\nrace because of their depth.<br />\nWidner College runners finished<br />\n1;2-3 but still finished 2nd.<br />\nJuniata, Swarthmore and<br /><br />\nLSAT<br /><br />\nREVIEW COURSE<br />\nEXTENSIVE 20 HOUR REVIEW<br />\nTAUGHT BY ATTORNEYS<br />\nNO ADD, CHARGE FOR TAKING COURSE MORE THAN ONCF<br /><br />\nCLASSES FOR DEC. 7 LSAT<br />\nBEGIN: Saturday, Nov. 16<br />\n9:30am - 1:30pm<br />\nat: Holiday Inn West<br />\nRt. 40 &amp; Rolling Rd.
