It has the impulse of past achievement and<br />\nthe st\u2022mulus of tradition. But to realize its status in the university some<br />\nknowledge is necessary of two institutions that have fostered and cherished it,<br />\nthe Dialectic and Philanthropic literary societies.\" These societies are almost coeval with the university itself, their life dating from the year 1795.<br />\nThe existence of two such societies in the same college with like interests<br />\nand aims led necessarily to friendly rivalry. This has taken the form of intersociety debates. At present the \"society stipulations\" provide for a series of<br />\nthree contests yearly, a fieshman -sophomore, a sophomore-junior, and a juniorsenior intersociety debate. Representatives for these debates are elected, but<br />\nmerit, not politics, is the arbiter. The stimulus and benefit arising from this<br />\ngraded system is obvious. The next step was to combine and seek a foreign<br />\nfoe. In 1897 a series of three intercollegiate debates was arranged with the<br />\nconUniversity of Georgia, and the arrangement renewed in 1900 for a similar<br />\nUniVanderbilt<br />\nwith<br />\ninto<br />\nentered<br />\nwas<br />\nagreement<br />\nlike<br />\na<br />\ntest. In the latter year<br />\nversity; the last debate of this series to be held this year at Vanderbilt, when,<br />\nIn all probability, another series will be arranged. The contests with Hopkins<br />\nare anticipated with much interest and pleasure. They promise contact with<br />\nnew phases and new methods.<br />\nNow a word about two methods of conducting these debates and the preparation of the debates. In the debates with Georgia, the legal proceedure that<br />\nclosObtains in our courts is followed, i. e. the affirmative has the opening and<br />\ning speeches, the negative practically no rejoinders. It is contended that this<br />\nto the negative<br />\narrangement has the effect of offsetting the advantage that falls<br />\nof proof.<br />\nburden<br />\nthe<br />\ncarries<br />\naffirmative<br />\nthe<br />\nwhereas<br />\nof having only to deny,<br />\nand<br />\ntheory<br />\nin<br />\nwrong<br />\nis<br />\nnt<br />\narrangeme<br />\nthis<br />\nthat<br />\nExperience proves, however,<br />\nbalcompletely<br />\nis<br />\nproof<br />\nof<br />\nburden<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nge<br />\ndisadvanta<br />\nPractice. The so-called<br />\nanced by the advantage the affirmative has in defining principles for the<br />\nget in<br />\naudience and crystalizing them into arguments before the negative can<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nstick.<br />\nto<br />\nprone<br />\nis<br />\nimpression<br />\nfirst<br />\nthe<br />\nits work. All else being equal,<br />\na<br />\nto<br />\npoints<br />\nthat<br />\ntendency<br />\nmarked<br />\na<br />\nis<br />\nthere<br />\nsecond place, under this system<br />\nopposing<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\npoints<br />\nsuch<br />\nonly<br />\nrebuttal<br />\nfor<br />\nmemorized essay incorporating<br />\ndexterity,<br />\nargument as the debater can anticipate under his study lamp. The<br />\nthe spice of extemporaneous debate is thus well nigh lost, and, almost as imPortant, the interest of the audience. The arrangement of alternate speeches<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nL<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n2<br />\n<br />\nfor affirmative and negative is more satisfactory because it opens play for<br />\noriginality and improvisation, and kindles the fire of expectation in the audience, in short, developes the spirit of debate.<br />\nBy a series of interclass and intersociety preliminary contests, the intercollegiate representative team thrice faces scrub teams that are only \"second best\"<br />\nto themselves. The debater who has fought his way up from \"fresh-soph\" to<br />\njunior-senior and through scrub contests to university representative is no<br />\n-mean antagonist. He has survived as the fittest.<br />\nHow does this work come in touch with other lines of endeavor in the university? In several ways. First, the committee that decides these contests is<br />\ncomposed of members of the faculty of the university; the coaches that drill the<br />\ndebaters into form are members of the faculty. such as the professors of logic,<br />\nof economics, of social science, of law (as the query may demand), of English,<br />\nof expression, of logic, and former debaters who have been through the mill<br />\nand won their laurels. Furthermore, the speeches thus prepared are accepted<br />\nas theses by the departments they most appropriately fall under; e. g., a speech<br />\nthus made on the trust problem could be offered as a graduating thesis in the<br />\ndepartment of economics.<br />\nSecond, it is evident that these debates are educative both for the individual participating and the student audience, but the influence does not stop<br />\nthere. Since, for example, many queries debated are of a political, sociologi<br />\na<br />\nassumes<br />\nnts<br />\ndepartme<br />\nthese<br />\nin<br />\ninterest<br />\n,<br />\ncal, or a purely industrial character<br />\nwork<br />\nmore aggressive attitude, from which the debates and the department<br />\nday<br />\npresent<br />\nthe<br />\nrealizing<br />\nschools,<br />\nscientific<br />\nthe<br />\nalike profit.

C.<br />\n<br />\nTHE FIRST INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE.<br />\n<br />\nT is always pleasant to be able to record a well-fought contest. If your side<br />\n<br />\nJ<br />\n<br />\nloses it's the fortunes of war: The fight is the greatest thing, and a great<br />\nfight did the Hopkins men put up in the first intercollegiate debate against<br />\nwas<br />\nthe team sent from the University of North Carolina. Close as the debate<br />\nour<br />\nfor<br />\nreason<br />\nprobable<br />\nthe<br />\nbut<br />\nwords,<br />\nfew<br />\nin<br />\na<br />\nup<br />\nit<br />\nsum<br />\nit is impossible to<br />\nmen<br />\nour<br />\nwhole<br />\nthe<br />\nOn<br />\non.<br />\npreparati<br />\nof<br />\ntime<br />\nand<br />\ne<br />\nexperienc<br />\ndefeat was lack of<br />\nd;<br />\nseemed to be fully as effective speakers as the gentlemen from the Southlan<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n3<br />\n<br />\nthey seemed to know their subject as well, and up to the last speech by the<br />\nnegative they were probably in the lead. In the opinion of some people in the<br />\naudience the speeches of the two Hopkins men did not fit together as well as<br />\nthose of their opponents, which may have had some effect on the decision. At<br />\nall events, our team of raw men debating against men whose training is sketched<br />\nIn .the preceding article put up a fight that was creditable enough to inspire<br />\nPride in every Hopkins son.<br />\nTo be more specific, our first speaker, Harry Plaggemeyer, was, as usual,<br />\nvery effective; he had with him that earnest, convincing manner that the critic<br />\nof the last inter-class debate has already noted. Plaggemeyer is so true in his<br />\nmethod that he would almost convince a judge if he recited one of \"Mother<br />\nGoose's\" rhymes. Plaggemeyer's first speech was, too, unutterably slow, and<br />\nwas only redeemed by the speaker's forensic skill. His speech had point to it,<br />\nbut it lacked vigor and attractiveness. Plaggemeyer seemed to feel this, and<br />\nwas not nearly so effective as in the second speech, when he warmed up to his<br />\nsubject and made one of the best speeches of the evening.<br />\nMr. Stern made the first speech for the negative. Stern is not an orator,<br />\nhut he says what he has to say in a clear-cut, intelligent manner, that carries<br />\nconviction wherever it is heard. This only applies to his first address. His<br />\nsecond speech would only have done justice to a third-rate demagogue. It is<br />\nIncomprehensible how a man of Mr. Stern's intelligence could have written so<br />\nPoor a speech. However, Stern's splendid first speech did much to give victory<br />\nto the negative.<br />\nStone for Hopkins was clever and, evidently, had considerable knowledge<br />\nof his subject. Both of his speeches seemed to be extemporaneous, and were,<br />\nconsequently, somewhat disjointed. Stone made some of his opponent's arguments appear so absurd and self-contradictory that they did not even attempt to<br />\nanswer him. Stone's rebuttal was admirable, and if any man at Hopkins has a<br />\ngreater power of satire, and knows how to get at the salient points of an argument better than Stone, he has not been heard at McCoy Hall for a few years.<br />\nBy far the best speaker of the evening was Williams. who closed the debate for North Carolina. His first speech fitted beautifully with his colleague's.<br />\nIt was a very interesting argument on \"How the Trust Promotes Foreign<br />\nTrade.\" His second speech, the last of the evening, was the best of the evening.<br />\nIn it, Williams won the debate for North Carolina. Before that speech it<br />\nseemed to the writer that Hopkins had the better of the discussion, but after it<br />\nthe judges could have only made one decision and they did.<br />\nBoth Stone and Plaggemeyer worked hard and spoke well, and it is quite<br />\nProbable that with a few more weeks preparation there would have been a differ<br />\nent story to tell. But as a gentleman who had much to do with the debate said:<br />\n\"Hopkins didn't lose by much\" This defeat at our first inter-collegiate debate<br />\nshould not discourage us, because there was nothing discouraging in our work.<br />\nIt would have been more discouraging to win a poor debate. A defeat like this<br />\none will only nerve us on to a victory over North Carolina and other colleges,<br />\n(Columbia and Brown, probably,) next year. That is, if we have the true<br />\nHopkins spirit.\"<br />\n<br />\n\f4<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nA TALK WITH DR. PEARSONS.<br />\n<br />\nR. D. K. PEARSONS is an aged Chicago philanthropist who has<br />\ngiven a great deal of money to Western colleges. His opinions on<br />\neducational methods are, therefore, of some weight. They are also<br />\nrather curious, when we remember that this is the twentieth century.<br />\nHere are some extracts from an interview given by Dr. Pearsons to some<br />\nnewspaper men in Chicago:<br />\n(Sfieaking of Football.)<br />\n\"It's a humbug. If I had a boy going to college and he played football or<br />\nbaseball I would whip him. Down with them both! They are fads and we, in<br />\nour educational practices get back to our first principles. They say football<br />\nand baseball are good exercise for muscular development; why, if you really<br />\nwant to develop a boy's muscles put him to sawing wood or raising potatoes<br />\nand watch his muscles grow. I never played football or baseball.<br />\n\"As for the college fads, they are bad, bad. The regular college curri<br />\nculum is the thing to follow, and when students go a chasing after this thing<br />\nand that thing they tumble over. There are too many fads, and one of the<br />\nworst is this habit of sending girls away to schools where tuition alone amounts<br />\nto several hundred dollars a year. There is no use of paying more than $2 a<br />\nweek for board and $150 should carry any young man or young woman through<br />\ncollege for a year.<br />\n\"They are through raising the kind of boys in the East that made this<br />\ncountry what it is, and the type of men are growing up in the West that made<br />\nNew England famous 100 years ago.

Before<br />\nhanding in our official resignation we desire, on behalf of the senior<br />\neditors, to say a few words of thanks to all those who have so kindly assisted<br />\nus in our efforts to make the NEWS-LETTER a success. Student and teacher<br />\nalike has encouraged us by active contribution and discriminating criticism,<br />\nand many who were formerly high enemies to the paper have, at last, condescended to support it. Our only aim has been to bring the NEWS-LETTER into<br />\ncloser contact with the men enrolled at the University, and the various changes<br />\nwe have made have only been means to that end. If the interest which is excited by the arrival of the paper from the printers, on Wednesday afternoon is<br />\na criterion we think we can modestly assert that we have gone a slight way on<br />\nthe path laid out. On the junior class the burden now lies of continuing the<br />\nNEWSLETTER, and though it is a burden which, at times, is onerous, the<br />\njunior representatives now on the paper can very well uphold it. To the editors about to assume charge of the paper, we wish all the success and prosperity due them and the undertaking they represent.<br />\n<br />\n4<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n7<br />\n<br />\nHE debate which the Hopkins representatives, Messrs. Plaggemeyer and<br />\nStone, put up at the first intercollegiate contest was so strong, and came<br />\nso near beating the trained speakers from the South that many people in<br />\nthe audience were in breathless suspense awaiting the decision. North Carolina with her wealth of orators, Hopkins in her first contest; North Carolina<br />\nholding the negative side of the Trust question, and thus having the last<br />\nSpeech, Hopkins working hard against this disadvantage: these antitheses<br />\nmake the defeat of the Hopkins team one to be as proud of as a victory. The<br />\nmost gratifying feature of the occasion was that the contest was engaged in by<br />\nundergraduates of both Universities, and not by trained law or theological<br />\nstudents, It is a rather striking coincidence that both of the Hopkins speakers<br />\nwere men who in later years will study medicine. Next year Hopkins will<br />\nhave more intercollegiate debates with colleges both North and South, and<br />\nthere is no reason why we cannot give any competitor a hard fight. On one<br />\nthing in any arrangements to be made Hopkins should insist, and that is that<br />\nall contests must be engaged in by undergraduates only. The only possible<br />\nsource from which we can draw debaters is the small undergraduate body, and<br />\nwe should demand that the men we go up against shall be in the same class.<br />\nIt would be foolish for our young undergraduates to debate with law students<br />\nor with students who devote the major part of their time to courses, which, in<br />\nthe Hopkins curriculum only take up two hours a month; and for that reason<br />\nwe should debate with colleges willing to send undergraduates against us, or<br />\nwe should not debate at all.<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nHE NEWS-1,1iTT1R desires to make a suggestion to the managers of Hop-<br />\n<br />\nkins athletics. Last fall the foot-ball management adopted the policy of<br />\nselling, at a moderate cost, season tickets to all the home games. This<br />\nPolicy resulted successfully. Now.that spring athletics are just about to start<br />\nWe would suggest to the managements of the base-ball and lacrosse teams that,<br />\nlf not conflicting with their financial arrangements, they also adopt this policy.<br />\nEverything is to be gained by such a step, and nothing can be lost, as tickets<br />\nfor the individual games can also be sold. It seems to us that a consolidation<br />\nof spring athletics into one by means of a season book, admitting to all Hopkins<br />\ngames in Baltimore would be a good thing, and would possibly be even better than two sets of season tickets. If such an innovation were tried, and<br />\nProved successful, its final culmination must be a year book admitting holder to<br />\nall home games.<br />\n<br />\ne<br />\n<br />\nHE home base ball season begins this Friday in a game with Princeton.<br />\nSo far the men have shown up so well and have put up such good work<br />\nthat past records are being forgotten in congratulations for this year's<br />\nwork. The best and only way for the students to support the sport, however, is<br />\nby attendance at the games, and we want to urge the presence of as many men<br />\nat the game Friday as generally attend an opening lacrosse game. Conscientiouly as the base ball lovers have worked they deserve support, and should get<br />\nit. The NRWS-LETTER hopes that the stands will be filled Friday.<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n8<br />\n<br />\nZ<br />\n<br />\nHE Maryland Intercollegiate Athletic Association has disbanded without<br />\nmuch disturbance The association has accomplished what it started to<br />\ndo, and with only three members its present status was not very important. Hopkins students have recently begun to care less and less for the<br />\nchampionship banners of the association, and at the end of the last foot-ball<br />\nseason expressions of a desire for Hopkins to get out of the League were heard<br />\non all sides. In football if a schedule can be arranged with more colleges outside of the State,\u2014the Pennsylvania and New York colleges for instance,\u2014<br />\nvictories will mean much more to us than the Maryland Intercollegiate banner,<br />\nand defeats will have much less sting Our track and field team for the last<br />\nfew years has been so far ahead of her competitors in the association that it almost had a monopoly at the association games, and the strongest teams we met<br />\non the track were not in the League.<br />\nThough the period of usefulness for the Maryland Association is past, it<br />\nhas, since its organization, been a strong factor\u2014almost the only factor\u2014in the<br />\nattempt to wipe out professionalism from the colleges in Maryland. To day<br />\nthe former members of the Maryland Association are almost the only colleges<br />\nin Maryland which run their athletics on a clean, amateur basis. When the<br />\nLeague started, professionalism was the rule at all colleges in Maryland. If<br />\nthe formation of the association has cleaned up athletics at a few colleges and<br />\nset an example for others to follow, it has been a benefit to athletics in this and<br />\nother States, as anything which has for its aim the promotion of true sport at<br />\nAmerican colleges is a benefit. If some of the larger northern Universities<br />\nwould be as careful about engaging with colleges of small standing who play<br />\nprofessionals as they are about their mutual exchange of courtesies, American<br />\ncollege sport would receive such an upward impetus that the small college playing professionals would be a thing of the past.<br />\n<br />\nWe beg to publish the following letter, and ask for answers to it.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSince the intercollegiate debate, several students at the University have<br />\nspoken about the reward that is due men who represent Hopkins in the intercollegiate college contests. They deserve some honor for their work just as<br />\nmuch as men on the lacrosse or foot-ball teams, and I should like to suggest to<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER that you ask for expressions of opinion on the matter from<br />\nthe students and faculty. It does not seem appropriate that the same as is<br />\nbestowed on athletes should be granted the debaters, but it certainly is plain<br />\nthat something parallel to the athletic \"H\" should be given them. They go<br />\nto the same trouble of training, the only difference being that in the case of the<br />\ndebaters the season is longer; they also uphold the honor of the black and blue<br />\nagainst opposing colleges just as the athletic teams do.

As was to be expected, the old men showed up to a better advantage than at any practice heretofore. From all appearances Putts will be<br />\nback at inhome, with his partner, B. Bernheim, at outhome. First attack is<br />\nStill being filled by different men among whom are Sayler, Smith, Pearre, and<br />\nBryan. Second attack is still open, but the chances are in favor of Bird. P.<br />\nBeruheim and Abercrombie will fill third attack and centre respectively, and<br />\nshould develop some clever team work.<br />\nOn the defense Tough has been playing third very credibly. As to second<br />\ndefense, Blank and Custis seem to be dividing the honors between them; more<br />\noutdoor practice will, probably, before long, show the better man. Henry<br />\nStraus will once more teach our opponents how to play first defense. Behind<br />\nhim, at cover, K Schmeisser is making a good showing, and with Captain<br />\nSchmeisser at point the team ought not to be afraid of too many goals against<br />\nthem. The goal will be filled by either Briscoe or Pels, neither of whom has as<br />\nYet the better of the argument.<br />\nIt was really surprising to the writer, when he went to the American<br />\nLeague Park on Saturday last, to see two full teams out for practice.

U. 15. ROCK HILL 10.<br />\nARCH 15th was very early for outdoor sport, yet the new base ball team<br />\nwas favored by a warm sun, with light wind and 50\u00b0 F. The game,<br />\nof course, was a preliminary trial, an experiment to test the qualities<br />\nof the different candidates, and the organization of the team. It was encouraging to note that every man was on band at the appointed hour. Whatever may<br />\nbe the abilities of those composing the base ball squad, and whatever the likelihood of producing a winning team, the good faith and purpose of the men cannot be doubted.<br />\nThe story of the game may be divided into two parts. For Hopkins,<br />\nWright went in to pitch, and it was soon apparent that he was not in condition.<br />\nThe balls went wild, and when they did come over the plate, the batter seemed<br />\nto be able to hit. Because of this, and because of three careless errors, Rock<br />\nHill was prospering, and had secured 10 runs by the end of the fourth inning.<br />\nIt was time for a change. Whipple went into the box, and the aspect of things<br />\naltered. In the five innings that he pitched only one safe hit was made, and<br />\nthat might have been prevented by a more desperate attempt to field the ball. The<br />\nman who reached first base was put out in a beautiful double play. Whipple<br />\nstruck out six men, and displayed admirable control and head work. Twice he<br />\nstruck out a batter who had only three balls. If such skill can be maintained,<br />\nwe need not fear for the success of the team of 1902.<br />\nOf the team itself, it may be said that it showed at first an unsteadiness not<br />\nto be wondered at in an opening game, but later played with harmony and<br />\nsnap. Marine, at second base, promised to do better than formerly. His fielding and batting have improved since last year. Eliot Strouse will make a<br />\nsuccess of short stop, and is useful for his batting, base running and \"ginger.\"<br />\nHe will improve by trying to cover more ground, and by playing more naturally. Nelson is a new man at third base. He is a hard worker and enthusiastic, and has made great improvement. He moves quickly and throws with<br />\nspeed and accuracy. So far his batting has been weak, but two good hits were<br />\nhis record in the game. McKnight, in left field, is a player of experience and<br />\nskill. He should strengthen the team greatly. Besides him, Ogle, Hand,<br />\nMarshall, and Crozier played in the outfield. All of them are good fielders and<br />\nbatters. Gilman, at first base, did very well, but he has not yet gotten into<br />\nshape. Campbell caught well, but is not up to the best form in throwing.<br />\nOf course, all efforts are directed to producing a strong team with which to<br />\noppose Princeton on the 28th. . By that time Constantine will be at his old<br />\nplace on first, and it is probable that Wright will be in the outfield. What<br />\nshowing Hopkins will make can only be conjectured, but let us hope that the<br />\nBlack and Blue will be valiantly upheld. The game will be interesting, anyhow, as it brings to Baltimore the college champions of the United States, and<br />\nopens for the National Game a new era among the colleges of this city.<br />\n<br />\nIn<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n13<br />\n<br />\nTRACK AND FIELD.<br />\nANNUAL ATHLETIC CONTEST<br />\n<br />\nal<br />\n<br />\nOTWITHSTANDING the second-term examinations just finished, the<br />\ntrack and field team has kept up pretty steady training for the games<br />\n.which will be held in the cage on the evening of April 5th. Each afternoon a large squad has turned out for work, and now that Pessagno and Tootle<br />\nare again in the running our showing should be better than ever.<br />\nHopkins will not be without a great many competitors, however, for not<br />\nonly are representatives coming from Washington and Philadelphia, but the<br />\nUnited States Naval Academy will send up a squad to enter the field, track and<br />\nfencing events. In the latter art the middies are extremely proficient, and<br />\nseveral novel exhibitions are promised. Professor Zehuber has several Hopkins<br />\nmen hard at work in learning how to handle the sword. Of these \"Billy\"<br />\nWeedon is among the most promising, and he will probably put up a very<br />\ncreditable bout.<br />\nIt was thought that Haverford College would send a team to compete, but<br />\nword has been received that the Quakers will not be able to come.<br />\nThe officials for the games have not yet been definitely decided upon, but<br />\nevery effort will be made to enlist the services of a competent corps of expePericnced men. Especial care will be given to the selection of handicappers.<br />\n. With regard to the condition of the track, also, great care will be taken.<br />\nEIghteen laps will constitute one mile, and the width will be increased to ten<br />\nfeet, Each afternoon the men from the preparatory schools who expect to enter<br />\nthe various events turn out, and at night the athletic clubs are given an opportunity to train. From these a great many expressions of satisfaction have been<br />\nheard in regard to the cinder track, banked at the curves. It is a great advantage over the slippery, flat track at the armory, and excellent time should be<br />\nMade on the running events.<br />\n. With the addition of the gallery, and the large seating capacity of the gymnasium and the interior of the track, ample room should be provided for the<br />\nsPectators.<br />\nVery naturally, Hopkins will enter a large squad in the contests. The list<br />\nhas not yet been completed, but among those who will try to win laurels for<br />\nhe black and blue will be Captain England, W. E. Hoffman, Riggs, Weedon,<br />\nLindsay, Stone, Blanck, Pessagno, Tootle, Whipple, Lawson, Scholl, Emig,<br />\nRosenheim, Brehm, LeCron, R. C. Hoffman, Williams, Tough and Gorwood<br />\n.<br />\nThe medals which will be given as prizes have been received from the<br />\nJeweler, and they are well worth striving for.<br />\nThe arrangements are in the hands of Aubrey Pearre, chairman; Howard<br />\nMatthai, Alexander Yearly, and William Murkland. These men are being<br />\nably assisted by Physical Director W. M. Mackdermott, who first suggested the<br />\nidea of holding regular indoor games in the Cage.<br />\n. On the night of the contests there will be large delegations present from the<br />\nvarious organizations entered, and it will be the duty of every Hopkins man to<br />\nturn out and show the spectators what real, genuine college yells and songs<br />\nsound like. In no other way can we gain popularity more quickly than by<br />\nShowing that we loyally support our athletic teams at the University. Let every<br />\nman be out!<br />\n<br />\nt<br />\n<br />\n\f14<br />\n<br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\nEXCLUSIVE ETHEL AND HER FRIEND.<br />\nAn Incident of the Debate.<br />\n<br />\nThere was once a girl named Exclusive Ethel. For three generations back<br />\nher male ancestors had never been guilty of wearing detachable cuffs. This entitled Ethel to break bread with the Colonial Dames. Ethel's last name was<br />\nde Bullion. Old man de Bullion spent his time at the bank; Algernon de Bullion spent his in the club windows and in a Turkish bath. But he did not own<br />\nup to the Turkish bath.<br />\nExclusive Ethel paid more attention to Fashion than a farmer does to a<br />\nsick shoat. While wandering on the boulevard nothing would make her step<br />\nhigh quicker than to pass a female person who advertised a popular brand of<br />\nperfumery.<br />\nMiss de Bullion had what the lady-novelists call a rose-bud mouth, and a<br />\nnose that came perilously near to tilting at an uncomfortable angle. But that<br />\nwas nuts to Ethel; it helped her to give a mere man a glance of scorn that was<br />\nsharp enough to urge a broken-down Cab Horse into a trot.<br />\nMr. Percival Polychrome was Exclusive Ethel's best friend. Although he<br />\nneeded money you could not have paid him to have admitted that his greatgrand-mother came over from Ireland in the steerage. He was a youthful member of Ethel's set If any one took ill just before a dinner party, it was always<br />\nMr. Percival who was Johnny-on-the-spot. He was really good at filling such<br />\nvacancies; the vacancy was hardly so noticeable when he filled in.<br />\nNow Percival had a cousin who played on the Mandolin Club at the University. The cousin was a good fellow. He had only one draw back\u2014that<br />\nwas Percival. When Percival went driving in a lady friend's victoria, he did<br />\nnot notice the poor cousin. But on occasions when he met him in the Rathkeller he would permit the cousin to purchaee a sloe gin ricky for him. When<br />\nPercival heard that there was to be a debate at the University, and discovered<br />\nthe select few to grace the occasion, he hied him to the cousin and exerted his<br />\ninfluence. The cousin gave him two tickets to pet rid of him.<br />\nThis was the opportunity that Percival Polychrome had been looking for.<br />\nIt would cost him nothing to take Exclusive Ethel to the function, and he<br />\nwould keep up his reputation as a friend of the ladies.<br />\nNow Ethel was a stickler for style. She wore a feather boa in sections because it was too long to wear all at once She had a Kangaroo walk that would<br />\nmake Dan Daly gasp with envy. If Exclusive Ethel had read in vogue that it<br />\nwas proper to chew gum, she would have taken hers from underneath the dining-room table, and paralyzed the pike by chewing in public. Ethel did not<br />\nwant to go to the debate before half past eight; because it was not stylish to go<br />\nearly. She wanted to rustle down the aisle amidst a flutter of sighs and subdued whispers. Sne knew that she looked extremely becoming that evening.<br />\nIn fact Mr. Percival Polychrome had told her so himself as he gazed into her<br />\ndeep, soulful eyes. She had looked down and blushed. Ethel could do a great<br />\ndeal with that blush; it was almost as great a winner as her eyes when they<br />\nwere suffused with tears.<br />\nIt pleased Percival that she did not want to go early, for he belonged to the<br />\n\"Knights of Rest.\" He also.rested in the daytime. He did not like to exert<br />\nhimself. It was not worth while to even play Ping-Pong. One always feels<br />\nlike bathing one's self in Talcum Powder if one plays the bloody game. That<br />\nwas the way he talked.<br />\nWhen they got to the University the doors were closed, and a horrid man<br />\nsaid that he would not let them in. There were other people there, but Exclusive Ethel only gave them the eye. She meant to get in or bust. The man<br />\n<br />\n\fTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br />\n<br />\n15<br />\n<br />\nasked her not to bust in the doorway. Ethel gave him a look of scorn; but it<br />\ndid not count. The man was as hard as ever. Exclusive Ethel knew a professor who was inside. If she could a note to him all would he well. For a<br />\nquarter the man decided to take the note. Now the professor was laying for a<br />\nchance to get even with the de Bunions. It happened that old man de Bullion<br />\nhad got chesty when the committee had come to him to ask him to aid the in.<br />\nstitution. So he took great pleasure in writing to Ethel that he could do nothing for her. Percival asked the man to give him his quarter back, hut the man<br />\nPretended not to hear him. Like the ordinary people Miss de Bullion and her<br />\nObedient escort were forced to forego the pleasure of hearing the Debate.<br />\nExclusive Ethel blamed their tardiness on Percival.<br />\n<br />\nSPECIMEN QUESTIONS FROM THIS WEEK'S EXAMINATION.<br />\nHow can the Shakspearian scholar assert that Shakspeare did not mention<br />\ntobacco in his plays, when the immortal William makes Richard III. speak of<br />\nthe '' weak, pifiini;, times of peace?\"<br />\nHow old was Anacreon when he wrote his \"Anachronisms?\"<br />\nWhat change in the Gregorian Calendar did Spenser make when he prepared his \"Shepard's Calendar?\"<br />\nWhat authority have we for the statement that Lamb was once fleeced?<br />\nDid Richard Brinsley Sheridan steal the thought of his immortal \"Sheridan's Ride\" from Cowper's \"John Gilpin's Ride?\"<br />\nState the facts concerning the controversy raised by Ignatius Donnelly's<br />\nCryptogram, proving that Grover Cleveland wrote Izaak Walton's\"Compleat<br />\nAngler.\"<br />\nGive the date that Burton's \"Anatomy of Melancholy\" was introduced as<br />\na text book in the Hopkins Medical School.<br />\nAre we certain that Sir Philip Sidney had read of \"Adolph and Gaston\"<br />\nWhen he refused a cup of water on the battlefield.<br />\nWhat similarity between Chaucer's wife of Bath's Tale and Swift's Tale of<br />\na Tube.<br />\nWould David B.

It has the impulse of past achievement and<br />\nthe st\u2022mulus of tradition. But to realize its status in the university some<br />\nknowledge is necessary of two institutions that have fostered and cherished it,<br />\nthe Dialectic and Philanthropic literary societies.\" These societies are almost coeval with the university itself, their life dating from the year 1795.<br />\nThe existence of two such societies in the same college with like interests<br />\nand aims led necessarily to friendly rivalry. This has taken the form of intersociety debates. At present the \"society stipulations\" provide for a series of<br />\nthree contests yearly, a fieshman -sophomore, a sophomore-junior, and a juniorsenior intersociety debate. Representatives for these debates are elected, but<br />\nmerit, not politics, is the arbiter. The stimulus and benefit arising from this<br />\ngraded system is obvious. The next step was to combine and seek a foreign<br />\nfoe. In 1897 a series of three intercollegiate debates was arranged with the<br />\nconUniversity of Georgia, and the arrangement renewed in 1900 for a similar<br />\nUniVanderbilt<br />\nwith<br />\ninto<br />\nentered<br />\nwas<br />\nagreement<br />\nlike<br />\na<br />\ntest. In the latter year<br />\nversity; the last debate of this series to be held this year at Vanderbilt, when,<br />\nIn all probability, another series will be arranged. The contests with Hopkins<br />\nare anticipated with much interest and pleasure. They promise contact with<br />\nnew phases and new methods.<br />\nNow a word about two methods of conducting these debates and the preparation of the debates. In the debates with Georgia, the legal proceedure that<br />\nclosObtains in our courts is followed, i. e. the affirmative has the opening and<br />\ning speeches, the negative practically no rejoinders. It is contended that this<br />\nto the negative<br />\narrangement has the effect of offsetting the advantage that falls<br />\nof proof.<br />\nburden<br />\nthe<br />\ncarries<br />\naffirmative<br />\nthe<br />\nwhereas<br />\nof having only to deny,<br />\nand<br />\ntheory<br />\nin<br />\nwrong<br />\nis<br />\nnt<br />\narrangeme<br />\nthis<br />\nthat<br />\nExperience proves, however,<br />\nbalcompletely<br />\nis<br />\nproof<br />\nof<br />\nburden<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\nge<br />\ndisadvanta<br />\nPractice. The so-called<br />\nanced by the advantage the affirmative has in defining principles for the<br />\nget in<br />\naudience and crystalizing them into arguments before the negative can<br />\nthe<br />\nIn<br />\nstick.<br />\nto<br />\nprone<br />\nis<br />\nimpression<br />\nfirst<br />\nthe<br />\nits work. All else being equal,<br />\na<br />\nto<br />\npoints<br />\nthat<br />\ntendency<br />\nmarked<br />\na<br />\nis<br />\nthere<br />\nsecond place, under this system<br />\nopposing<br />\nthe<br />\nof<br />\npoints<br />\nsuch<br />\nonly<br />\nrebuttal<br />\nfor<br />\nmemorized essay incorporating<br />\ndexterity,<br />\nargument as the debater can anticipate under his study lamp. The<br />\nthe spice of extemporaneous debate is thus well nigh lost, and, almost as imPortant, the interest of the audience. The arrangement of alternate speeches<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\nL<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n2<br /><br />\nfor affirmative and negative is more satisfactory because it opens play for<br />\noriginality and improvisation, and kindles the fire of expectation in the audience, in short, developes the spirit of debate.<br />\nBy a series of interclass and intersociety preliminary contests, the intercollegiate representative team thrice faces scrub teams that are only \"second best\"<br />\nto themselves. The debater who has fought his way up from \"fresh-soph\" to<br />\njunior-senior and through scrub contests to university representative is no<br />\n-mean antagonist. He has survived as the fittest.<br />\nHow does this work come in touch with other lines of endeavor in the university? In several ways. First, the committee that decides these contests is<br />\ncomposed of members of the faculty of the university; the coaches that drill the<br />\ndebaters into form are members of the faculty. such as the professors of logic,<br />\nof economics, of social science, of law (as the query may demand), of English,<br />\nof expression, of logic, and former debaters who have been through the mill<br />\nand won their laurels. Furthermore, the speeches thus prepared are accepted<br />\nas theses by the departments they most appropriately fall under; e. g., a speech<br />\nthus made on the trust problem could be offered as a graduating thesis in the<br />\ndepartment of economics.<br />\nSecond, it is evident that these debates are educative both for the individual participating and the student audience, but the influence does not stop<br />\nthere. Since, for example, many queries debated are of a political, sociologi<br />\na<br />\nassumes<br />\nnts<br />\ndepartme<br />\nthese<br />\nin<br />\ninterest<br />\n,<br />\ncal, or a purely industrial character<br />\nwork<br />\nmore aggressive attitude, from which the debates and the department<br />\nday<br />\npresent<br />\nthe<br />\nrealizing<br />\nschools,<br />\nscientific<br />\nthe<br />\nalike profit.

C.<br /><br />\nTHE FIRST INTERCOLLEGIATE DEBATE.<br /><br />\nT is always pleasant to be able to record a well-fought contest. If your side<br /><br />\nJ<br /><br />\nloses it's the fortunes of war: The fight is the greatest thing, and a great<br />\nfight did the Hopkins men put up in the first intercollegiate debate against<br />\nwas<br />\nthe team sent from the University of North Carolina. Close as the debate<br />\nour<br />\nfor<br />\nreason<br />\nprobable<br />\nthe<br />\nbut<br />\nwords,<br />\nfew<br />\nin<br />\na<br />\nup<br />\nit<br />\nsum<br />\nit is impossible to<br />\nmen<br />\nour<br />\nwhole<br />\nthe<br />\nOn<br />\non.<br />\npreparati<br />\nof<br />\ntime<br />\nand<br />\ne<br />\nexperienc<br />\ndefeat was lack of<br />\nd;<br />\nseemed to be fully as effective speakers as the gentlemen from the Southlan<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n3<br /><br />\nthey seemed to know their subject as well, and up to the last speech by the<br />\nnegative they were probably in the lead. In the opinion of some people in the<br />\naudience the speeches of the two Hopkins men did not fit together as well as<br />\nthose of their opponents, which may have had some effect on the decision. At<br />\nall events, our team of raw men debating against men whose training is sketched<br />\nIn .the preceding article put up a fight that was creditable enough to inspire<br />\nPride in every Hopkins son.<br />\nTo be more specific, our first speaker, Harry Plaggemeyer, was, as usual,<br />\nvery effective; he had with him that earnest, convincing manner that the critic<br />\nof the last inter-class debate has already noted. Plaggemeyer is so true in his<br />\nmethod that he would almost convince a judge if he recited one of \"Mother<br />\nGoose's\" rhymes. Plaggemeyer's first speech was, too, unutterably slow, and<br />\nwas only redeemed by the speaker's forensic skill. His speech had point to it,<br />\nbut it lacked vigor and attractiveness. Plaggemeyer seemed to feel this, and<br />\nwas not nearly so effective as in the second speech, when he warmed up to his<br />\nsubject and made one of the best speeches of the evening.<br />\nMr. Stern made the first speech for the negative. Stern is not an orator,<br />\nhut he says what he has to say in a clear-cut, intelligent manner, that carries<br />\nconviction wherever it is heard. This only applies to his first address. His<br />\nsecond speech would only have done justice to a third-rate demagogue. It is<br />\nIncomprehensible how a man of Mr. Stern's intelligence could have written so<br />\nPoor a speech. However, Stern's splendid first speech did much to give victory<br />\nto the negative.<br />\nStone for Hopkins was clever and, evidently, had considerable knowledge<br />\nof his subject. Both of his speeches seemed to be extemporaneous, and were,<br />\nconsequently, somewhat disjointed. Stone made some of his opponent's arguments appear so absurd and self-contradictory that they did not even attempt to<br />\nanswer him. Stone's rebuttal was admirable, and if any man at Hopkins has a<br />\ngreater power of satire, and knows how to get at the salient points of an argument better than Stone, he has not been heard at McCoy Hall for a few years.<br />\nBy far the best speaker of the evening was Williams. who closed the debate for North Carolina. His first speech fitted beautifully with his colleague's.<br />\nIt was a very interesting argument on \"How the Trust Promotes Foreign<br />\nTrade.\" His second speech, the last of the evening, was the best of the evening.<br />\nIn it, Williams won the debate for North Carolina. Before that speech it<br />\nseemed to the writer that Hopkins had the better of the discussion, but after it<br />\nthe judges could have only made one decision and they did.<br />\nBoth Stone and Plaggemeyer worked hard and spoke well, and it is quite<br />\nProbable that with a few more weeks preparation there would have been a differ<br />\nent story to tell. But as a gentleman who had much to do with the debate said:<br />\n\"Hopkins didn't lose by much\" This defeat at our first inter-collegiate debate<br />\nshould not discourage us, because there was nothing discouraging in our work.<br />\nIt would have been more discouraging to win a poor debate. A defeat like this<br />\none will only nerve us on to a victory over North Carolina and other colleges,<br />\n(Columbia and Brown, probably,) next year. That is, if we have the true<br />\nHopkins spirit.\"<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br />\nA TALK WITH DR. PEARSONS.<br /><br />\nR. D. K. PEARSONS is an aged Chicago philanthropist who has<br />\ngiven a great deal of money to Western colleges. His opinions on<br />\neducational methods are, therefore, of some weight. They are also<br />\nrather curious, when we remember that this is the twentieth century.<br />\nHere are some extracts from an interview given by Dr. Pearsons to some<br />\nnewspaper men in Chicago:<br />\n(Sfieaking of Football.)<br />\n\"It's a humbug. If I had a boy going to college and he played football or<br />\nbaseball I would whip him. Down with them both!

They say football<br />\nand baseball are good exercise for muscular development; why, if you really<br />\nwant to develop a boy's muscles put him to sawing wood or raising potatoes<br />\nand watch his muscles grow. I never played football or baseball.<br />\n\"As for the college fads, they are bad, bad. The regular college curri<br />\nculum is the thing to follow, and when students go a chasing after this thing<br />\nand that thing they tumble over. There are too many fads, and one of the<br />\nworst is this habit of sending girls away to schools where tuition alone amounts<br />\nto several hundred dollars a year. There is no use of paying more than $2 a<br />\nweek for board and $150 should carry any young man or young woman through<br />\ncollege for a year.<br />\n\"They are through raising the kind of boys in the East that made this<br />\ncountry what it is, and the type of men are growing up in the West that made<br />\nNew England famous 100 years ago.

Before<br />\nhanding in our official resignation we desire, on behalf of the senior<br />\neditors, to say a few words of thanks to all those who have so kindly assisted<br />\nus in our efforts to make the NEWS-LETTER a success. Student and teacher<br />\nalike has encouraged us by active contribution and discriminating criticism,<br />\nand many who were formerly high enemies to the paper have, at last, condescended to support it. Our only aim has been to bring the NEWS-LETTER into<br />\ncloser contact with the men enrolled at the University, and the various changes<br />\nwe have made have only been means to that end. If the interest which is excited by the arrival of the paper from the printers, on Wednesday afternoon is<br />\na criterion we think we can modestly assert that we have gone a slight way on<br />\nthe path laid out. On the junior class the burden now lies of continuing the<br />\nNEWSLETTER, and though it is a burden which, at times, is onerous, the<br />\njunior representatives now on the paper can very well uphold it. To the editors about to assume charge of the paper, we wish all the success and prosperity due them and the undertaking they represent.<br /><br />\n4<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n7<br /><br />\nHE debate which the Hopkins representatives, Messrs. Plaggemeyer and<br />\nStone, put up at the first intercollegiate contest was so strong, and came<br />\nso near beating the trained speakers from the South that many people in<br />\nthe audience were in breathless suspense awaiting the decision. North Carolina with her wealth of orators, Hopkins in her first contest; North Carolina<br />\nholding the negative side of the Trust question, and thus having the last<br />\nSpeech, Hopkins working hard against this disadvantage: these antitheses<br />\nmake the defeat of the Hopkins team one to be as proud of as a victory. The<br />\nmost gratifying feature of the occasion was that the contest was engaged in by<br />\nundergraduates of both Universities, and not by trained law or theological<br />\nstudents, It is a rather striking coincidence that both of the Hopkins speakers<br />\nwere men who in later years will study medicine. Next year Hopkins will<br />\nhave more intercollegiate debates with colleges both North and South, and<br />\nthere is no reason why we cannot give any competitor a hard fight. On one<br />\nthing in any arrangements to be made Hopkins should insist, and that is that<br />\nall contests must be engaged in by undergraduates only. The only possible<br />\nsource from which we can draw debaters is the small undergraduate body, and<br />\nwe should demand that the men we go up against shall be in the same class.<br />\nIt would be foolish for our young undergraduates to debate with law students<br />\nor with students who devote the major part of their time to courses, which, in<br />\nthe Hopkins curriculum only take up two hours a month; and for that reason<br />\nwe should debate with colleges willing to send undergraduates against us, or<br />\nwe should not debate at all.<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nHE NEWS-1,1iTT1R desires to make a suggestion to the managers of Hop-<br /><br />\nkins athletics. Last fall the foot-ball management adopted the policy of<br />\nselling, at a moderate cost, season tickets to all the home games. This<br />\nPolicy resulted successfully. Now.that spring athletics are just about to start<br />\nWe would suggest to the managements of the base-ball and lacrosse teams that,<br />\nlf not conflicting with their financial arrangements, they also adopt this policy.<br />\nEverything is to be gained by such a step, and nothing can be lost, as tickets<br />\nfor the individual games can also be sold. It seems to us that a consolidation<br />\nof spring athletics into one by means of a season book, admitting to all Hopkins<br />\ngames in Baltimore would be a good thing, and would possibly be even better than two sets of season tickets. If such an innovation were tried, and<br />\nProved successful, its final culmination must be a year book admitting holder to<br />\nall home games.<br /><br />\ne<br /><br />\nHE home base ball season begins this Friday in a game with Princeton.<br />\nSo far the men have shown up so well and have put up such good work<br />\nthat past records are being forgotten in congratulations for this year's<br />\nwork. The best and only way for the students to support the sport, however, is<br />\nby attendance at the games, and we want to urge the presence of as many men<br />\nat the game Friday as generally attend an opening lacrosse game. Conscientiouly as the base ball lovers have worked they deserve support, and should get<br />\nit. The NRWS-LETTER hopes that the stands will be filled Friday.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS-LETTER.<br /><br />\n8<br /><br />\nZ<br /><br />\nHE Maryland Intercollegiate Athletic Association has disbanded without<br />\nmuch disturbance The association has accomplished what it started to<br />\ndo, and with only three members its present status was not very important. Hopkins students have recently begun to care less and less for the<br />\nchampionship banners of the association, and at the end of the last foot-ball<br />\nseason expressions of a desire for Hopkins to get out of the League were heard<br />\non all sides. In football if a schedule can be arranged with more colleges outside of the State,\u2014the Pennsylvania and New York colleges for instance,\u2014<br />\nvictories will mean much more to us than the Maryland Intercollegiate banner,<br />\nand defeats will have much less sting Our track and field team for the last<br />\nfew years has been so far ahead of her competitors in the association that it almost had a monopoly at the association games, and the strongest teams we met<br />\non the track were not in the League.<br />\nThough the period of usefulness for the Maryland Association is past, it<br />\nhas, since its organization, been a strong factor\u2014almost the only factor\u2014in the<br />\nattempt to wipe out professionalism from the colleges in Maryland. To day<br />\nthe former members of the Maryland Association are almost the only colleges<br />\nin Maryland which run their athletics on a clean, amateur basis. When the<br />\nLeague started, professionalism was the rule at all colleges in Maryland. If<br />\nthe formation of the association has cleaned up athletics at a few colleges and<br />\nset an example for others to follow, it has been a benefit to athletics in this and<br />\nother States, as anything which has for its aim the promotion of true sport at<br />\nAmerican colleges is a benefit. If some of the larger northern Universities<br />\nwould be as careful about engaging with colleges of small standing who play<br />\nprofessionals as they are about their mutual exchange of courtesies, American<br />\ncollege sport would receive such an upward impetus that the small college playing professionals would be a thing of the past.<br /><br />\nWe beg to publish the following letter, and ask for answers to it.<br />\nTo the Editor of THE NEWS-LETTER:<br />\nSince the intercollegiate debate, several students at the University have<br />\nspoken about the reward that is due men who represent Hopkins in the intercollegiate college contests. They deserve some honor for their work just as<br />\nmuch as men on the lacrosse or foot-ball teams, and I should like to suggest to<br />\nthe NEWS-LETTER that you ask for expressions of opinion on the matter from<br />\nthe students and faculty. It does not seem appropriate that the same as is<br />\nbestowed on athletes should be granted the debaters, but it certainly is plain<br />\nthat something parallel to the athletic \"H\" should be given them. They go<br />\nto the same trouble of training, the only difference being that in the case of the<br />\ndebaters the season is longer; they also uphold the honor of the black and blue<br />\nagainst opposing colleges just as the athletic teams do. The main point is<br />\nhow to reward them.<br />\nA SENIOR.<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n9<br /><br />\nL'Al111111111111111111wir111111imm111111111iiiiiitoilill11111111111111111110111111111111111111111111111M111111111111111111111111111111111111111111M111$1111111111111111111111211''<br /><br />\notertd\u201e.m10,<br />\n\u00b0'se,dzoll<br /><br />\niiiiipoimourouinuonimonu iiiiiminnuounouunnumminiallerc,, .:;i.i'Z;,\u2022k!<br />\nR.

ROCK HILL 10.<br />\nARCH 15th was very early for outdoor sport, yet the new base ball team<br />\nwas favored by a warm sun, with light wind and 50\u00b0 F. The game,<br />\nof course, was a preliminary trial, an experiment to test the qualities<br />\nof the different candidates, and the organization of the team. It was encouraging to note that every man was on band at the appointed hour. Whatever may<br />\nbe the abilities of those composing the base ball squad, and whatever the likelihood of producing a winning team, the good faith and purpose of the men cannot be doubted.<br />\nThe story of the game may be divided into two parts. For Hopkins,<br />\nWright went in to pitch, and it was soon apparent that he was not in condition.<br />\nThe balls went wild, and when they did come over the plate, the batter seemed<br />\nto be able to hit. Because of this, and because of three careless errors, Rock<br />\nHill was prospering, and had secured 10 runs by the end of the fourth inning.<br />\nIt was time for a change. Whipple went into the box, and the aspect of things<br />\naltered. In the five innings that he pitched only one safe hit was made, and<br />\nthat might have been prevented by a more desperate attempt to field the ball. The<br />\nman who reached first base was put out in a beautiful double play. Whipple<br />\nstruck out six men, and displayed admirable control and head work. Twice he<br />\nstruck out a batter who had only three balls. If such skill can be maintained,<br />\nwe need not fear for the success of the team of 1902.<br />\nOf the team itself, it may be said that it showed at first an unsteadiness not<br />\nto be wondered at in an opening game, but later played with harmony and<br />\nsnap. Marine, at second base, promised to do better than formerly. His fielding and batting have improved since last year. Eliot Strouse will make a<br />\nsuccess of short stop, and is useful for his batting, base running and \"ginger.\"<br />\nHe will improve by trying to cover more ground, and by playing more naturally. Nelson is a new man at third base. He is a hard worker and enthusiastic, and has made great improvement. He moves quickly and throws with<br />\nspeed and accuracy. So far his batting has been weak, but two good hits were<br />\nhis record in the game. McKnight, in left field, is a player of experience and<br />\nskill. He should strengthen the team greatly. Besides him, Ogle, Hand,<br />\nMarshall, and Crozier played in the outfield. All of them are good fielders and<br />\nbatters. Gilman, at first base, did very well, but he has not yet gotten into<br />\nshape. Campbell caught well, but is not up to the best form in throwing.<br />\nOf course, all efforts are directed to producing a strong team with which to<br />\noppose Princeton on the 28th. . By that time Constantine will be at his old<br />\nplace on first, and it is probable that Wright will be in the outfield. What<br />\nshowing Hopkins will make can only be conjectured, but let us hope that the<br />\nBlack and Blue will be valiantly upheld. The game will be interesting, anyhow, as it brings to Baltimore the college champions of the United States, and<br />\nopens for the National Game a new era among the colleges of this city.<br /><br />\nIn<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n13<br /><br />\nTRACK AND FIELD.<br />\nANNUAL ATHLETIC CONTEST<br /><br />\nal<br /><br />\nOTWITHSTANDING the second-term examinations just finished, the<br />\ntrack and field team has kept up pretty steady training for the games<br />\n.which will be held in the cage on the evening of April 5th. Each afternoon a large squad has turned out for work, and now that Pessagno and Tootle<br />\nare again in the running our showing should be better than ever.<br />\nHopkins will not be without a great many competitors, however, for not<br />\nonly are representatives coming from Washington and Philadelphia, but the<br />\nUnited States Naval Academy will send up a squad to enter the field, track and<br />\nfencing events. In the latter art the middies are extremely proficient, and<br />\nseveral novel exhibitions are promised. Professor Zehuber has several Hopkins<br />\nmen hard at work in learning how to handle the sword. Of these \"Billy\"<br />\nWeedon is among the most promising, and he will probably put up a very<br />\ncreditable bout.<br />\nIt was thought that Haverford College would send a team to compete, but<br />\nword has been received that the Quakers will not be able to come.<br />\nThe officials for the games have not yet been definitely decided upon, but<br />\nevery effort will be made to enlist the services of a competent corps of expePericnced men. Especial care will be given to the selection of handicappers.<br />\n. With regard to the condition of the track, also, great care will be taken.<br />\nEIghteen laps will constitute one mile, and the width will be increased to ten<br />\nfeet, Each afternoon the men from the preparatory schools who expect to enter<br />\nthe various events turn out, and at night the athletic clubs are given an opportunity to train. From these a great many expressions of satisfaction have been<br />\nheard in regard to the cinder track, banked at the curves. It is a great advantage over the slippery, flat track at the armory, and excellent time should be<br />\nMade on the running events.<br />\n. With the addition of the gallery, and the large seating capacity of the gymnasium and the interior of the track, ample room should be provided for the<br />\nsPectators.<br />\nVery naturally, Hopkins will enter a large squad in the contests. The list<br />\nhas not yet been completed, but among those who will try to win laurels for<br />\nhe black and blue will be Captain England, W. E. Hoffman, Riggs, Weedon,<br />\nLindsay, Stone, Blanck, Pessagno, Tootle, Whipple, Lawson, Scholl, Emig,<br />\nRosenheim, Brehm, LeCron, R. C. Hoffman, Williams, Tough and Gorwood<br />\n.<br />\nThe medals which will be given as prizes have been received from the<br />\nJeweler, and they are well worth striving for.<br />\nThe arrangements are in the hands of Aubrey Pearre, chairman; Howard<br />\nMatthai, Alexander Yearly, and William Murkland. These men are being<br />\nably assisted by Physical Director W. M. Mackdermott, who first suggested the<br />\nidea of holding regular indoor games in the Cage.<br />\n. On the night of the contests there will be large delegations present from the<br />\nvarious organizations entered, and it will be the duty of every Hopkins man to<br />\nturn out and show the spectators what real, genuine college yells and songs<br />\nsound like. In no other way can we gain popularity more quickly than by<br />\nShowing that we loyally support our athletic teams at the University.

For three generations back<br />\nher male ancestors had never been guilty of wearing detachable cuffs. This entitled Ethel to break bread with the Colonial Dames. Ethel's last name was<br />\nde Bullion. Old man de Bullion spent his time at the bank; Algernon de Bullion spent his in the club windows and in a Turkish bath. But he did not own<br />\nup to the Turkish bath.<br />\nExclusive Ethel paid more attention to Fashion than a farmer does to a<br />\nsick shoat. While wandering on the boulevard nothing would make her step<br />\nhigh quicker than to pass a female person who advertised a popular brand of<br />\nperfumery.<br />\nMiss de Bullion had what the lady-novelists call a rose-bud mouth, and a<br />\nnose that came perilously near to tilting at an uncomfortable angle. But that<br />\nwas nuts to Ethel; it helped her to give a mere man a glance of scorn that was<br />\nsharp enough to urge a broken-down Cab Horse into a trot.<br />\nMr. Percival Polychrome was Exclusive Ethel's best friend. Although he<br />\nneeded money you could not have paid him to have admitted that his greatgrand-mother came over from Ireland in the steerage. He was a youthful member of Ethel's set If any one took ill just before a dinner party, it was always<br />\nMr. Percival who was Johnny-on-the-spot. He was really good at filling such<br />\nvacancies; the vacancy was hardly so noticeable when he filled in.<br />\nNow Percival had a cousin who played on the Mandolin Club at the University. The cousin was a good fellow. He had only one draw back\u2014that<br />\nwas Percival. When Percival went driving in a lady friend's victoria, he did<br />\nnot notice the poor cousin. But on occasions when he met him in the Rathkeller he would permit the cousin to purchaee a sloe gin ricky for him. When<br />\nPercival heard that there was to be a debate at the University, and discovered<br />\nthe select few to grace the occasion, he hied him to the cousin and exerted his<br />\ninfluence. The cousin gave him two tickets to pet rid of him.<br />\nThis was the opportunity that Percival Polychrome had been looking for.<br />\nIt would cost him nothing to take Exclusive Ethel to the function, and he<br />\nwould keep up his reputation as a friend of the ladies.<br />\nNow Ethel was a stickler for style. She wore a feather boa in sections because it was too long to wear all at once She had a Kangaroo walk that would<br />\nmake Dan Daly gasp with envy. If Exclusive Ethel had read in vogue that it<br />\nwas proper to chew gum, she would have taken hers from underneath the dining-room table, and paralyzed the pike by chewing in public. Ethel did not<br />\nwant to go to the debate before half past eight; because it was not stylish to go<br />\nearly. She wanted to rustle down the aisle amidst a flutter of sighs and subdued whispers. Sne knew that she looked extremely becoming that evening.<br />\nIn fact Mr. Percival Polychrome had told her so himself as he gazed into her<br />\ndeep, soulful eyes. She had looked down and blushed. Ethel could do a great<br />\ndeal with that blush; it was almost as great a winner as her eyes when they<br />\nwere suffused with tears.<br />\nIt pleased Percival that she did not want to go early, for he belonged to the<br />\n\"Knights of Rest.\" He also.rested in the daytime. He did not like to exert<br />\nhimself. It was not worth while to even play Ping-Pong. One always feels<br />\nlike bathing one's self in Talcum Powder if one plays the bloody game. That<br />\nwas the way he talked.<br />\nWhen they got to the University the doors were closed, and a horrid man<br />\nsaid that he would not let them in. There were other people there, but Exclusive Ethel only gave them the eye. She meant to get in or bust. The man<br /><br />\nTHE NEWS\u2014LETTER.<br /><br />\n15<br /><br />\nasked her not to bust in the doorway. Ethel gave him a look of scorn; but it<br />\ndid not count. The man was as hard as ever. Exclusive Ethel knew a professor who was inside. If she could a note to him all would he well. For a<br />\nquarter the man decided to take the note. Now the professor was laying for a<br />\nchance to get even with the de Bunions. It happened that old man de Bullion<br />\nhad got chesty when the committee had come to him to ask him to aid the in.<br />\nstitution. So he took great pleasure in writing to Ethel that he could do nothing for her. Percival asked the man to give him his quarter back, hut the man<br />\nPretended not to hear him. Like the ordinary people Miss de Bullion and her<br />\nObedient escort were forced to forego the pleasure of hearing the Debate.<br />\nExclusive Ethel blamed their tardiness on Percival.<br /><br />\nSPECIMEN QUESTIONS FROM THIS WEEK'S EXAMINATION.<br />\nHow can the Shakspearian scholar assert that Shakspeare did not mention<br />\ntobacco in his plays, when the immortal William makes Richard III. speak of<br />\nthe '' weak, pifiini;, times of peace?\"<br />\nHow old was Anacreon when he wrote his \"Anachronisms?\"<br />\nWhat change in the Gregorian Calendar did Spenser make when he prepared his \"Shepard's Calendar?\"<br />\nWhat authority have we for the statement that Lamb was once fleeced?<br />\nDid Richard Brinsley Sheridan steal the thought of his immortal \"Sheridan's Ride\" from Cowper's \"John Gilpin's Ride?\"<br />\nState the facts concerning the controversy raised by Ignatius Donnelly's<br />\nCryptogram, proving that Grover Cleveland wrote Izaak Walton's\"Compleat<br />\nAngler.\"<br />\nGive the date that Burton's \"Anatomy of Melancholy\" was introduced as<br />\na text book in the Hopkins Medical School.<br />\nAre we certain that Sir Philip Sidney had read of \"Adolph and Gaston\"<br />\nWhen he refused a cup of water on the battlefield.<br />\nWhat similarity between Chaucer's wife of Bath's Tale and Swift's Tale of<br />\na Tube.<br />\nWould David B.
