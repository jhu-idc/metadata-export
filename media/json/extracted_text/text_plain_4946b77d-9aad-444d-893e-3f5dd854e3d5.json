In the<br />\npast sixteen years he has made six attempts to gain<br />\npublic office. His only conquest has been a seat on<br />\nthe Maryland State Racing Commission, held in the<br />\n1.940's. A curiosity in the present election, (Mahoney's<br />\nSeventh), is that a man so enveloped by politics should<br />\napparently lack an entourage of committed supporters.<br />\ntIowhem can we find the \"Mahoney organization\", the<br />\n*Mahoney men\". His headquarters lack the starryeyed young girls folding letters and answering the<br />\nphone (it seldom rings). The billboard and bumper<br />\nSticker advertisements are sparse. Testimonial banquets,<br />\ntelevision appearances and rallies have been confined<br />\nto the Republicans.<br />\nMahoney claims that he isn't running against another<br />\ncandidate but against the present condition \"of things\".<br />\nTherefore he needs no political alliances or wham-bha.m<br />\nCampaigns.\"The great body politic knows where George<br />\n\u201eMahoney stands.\" One must wonder whether this is the<br />\nCase or was Mahoney left to fend for himself by the<br />\nembarrassed political chieftains.<br />\nControls Districts<br />\nThe most powerful political \"boss\" In Baltimore is<br />\ndames H. (Jack) Pollack. His \"Trenton Democratic<br />\nClub\" controls the Fourth and Fifth Districts in Baltimore City, and branches occasionally into contested<br />\nterritory. He has manipulated elections, the Baltimore<br />\nCity Council and an occasional judge for three decades.<br />\nFor two decades George Mahoney and Jack Pollack<br />\nMillard<br />\nhave been close political allies united against<br />\nundesirable<br />\nMahoney<br />\nmade<br />\noften<br />\nunion<br />\nTawes. This<br />\nHyman Pressin the eyes of political \"moralists\" like<br />\neffective<br />\nman but Pollack's support was a coveted and<br />\nprize.<br />\nseems<br />\nPollack's participation in the present campaign<br />\nof some hankyto be minimal. There have been reports<br />\nPollack<br />\npanky in the primary but it doesn't seem that<br />\nit.<br />\nin<br />\nheart<br />\nhis<br />\nhas<br />\nPollack's<br />\nMahoney might rightfully feel cheated bydistributed<br />\nsupport. As yet no sample ballots have been<br />\nthere's reasonin the Fourth and Fifth Districts and<br />\nPollack is<br />\nable doubt Mahoney would head them. If<br />\nthe<br />\nspending money today like he did in 1958 when<br />\nthis<br />\ndoes<br />\nit<br />\n(as<br />\nMaryland<br />\nignoring<br />\nflational party was<br />\nfar Marear), then it isn't evident to the public. So<br />\nfinanced from<br />\nhoney's campaign could easily have been<br />\nhis own pocket.<br />\nPollack Hesitant<br />\npossibilities<br />\nWhy would Pollack be so hesitant? Two<br />\nDemocratic<br />\nTrenton<br />\nthe<br />\ncomprising<br />\ndistricts<br />\narise. The<br />\nJews<br />\nClub are dominated by Negroes (the Fourth) and<br />\n.(the Fifth). Pollack would have to spend a lot of<br />\nfavors within his own family to whip up support for<br />\nMahoney and his crusade against open-occupancy.<br />\nThe second reason, related to the first, is that Pollack's power source is declining rapidly. Not only is he<br />\nhesitant to exhaust it, but it is possible that his next<br />\nmistake will be his last and Mahoney offers little security. Attorney-General Finan has labeled Mahoney's<br />\ncampaign \"Pollack's last stand.\"<br />\nWith the figureheads of the Democratic party (Tydtngs, Brewster, Tawes, Sickles) avoiding Mahoney. the<br />\ntack of organiZational support \u2022leaves the Democratic<br />\nnominee one alternative\u2014the people. There is no need<br />\ntor Mahoney to energetically campaign if the people<br />\nalrady know (in their hearts?) that he is right. He<br />\ndoesn't have to discuss the issues, confront his opponents or spend a lot of money.<br />\nOn the other hand, with a glaring absence of supporters. did he ever have the choice?<br />\n<br />\npLuRYING.

MAHONEY<br />\n<br />\nGroup Formed To Stop Mahoney;<br />\nSeeks Volunteers From Hopkins<br />\nBy DENN-I ESTIS<br />\n\"Democrats may have nominated for Governor one<br />\nof the worst racist bigots in the history of Maryland<br />\npolitics.\" This opinion was expressed by James Reston,<br />\nveteran New York Times columnist, in his description<br />\nthe Democratic candidate for governor, George P. Mahoney, on October 9.<br />\nSimilar statements have been echoed by many diverse national organizations including the Americans<br />\nfor Democratic Action, The New Republic, The Washington Post, and the New York Tines.<br />\nTowson State Demonstrations<br />\nSpurred on by recent racist demonstrations held by<br />\nthe National States Rights Party and the Klu Klux<br />\nKlan at Towson State College in support of Mr. Mahoney, several concerned Johns Hopkins University<br />\ngraduate studentsDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents\u2014deciding that a Mahoney win was a distinct<br />\npossibility, formed an independent organization devoid<br />\nof the Republican and Democratic partisanship called<br />\nthe Citizens To Stop Mahoney.<br />\nThe new group's philosophy is to get every possible<br />\nvoter out in a last determined move. William Dobelle,<br />\na Hopkins graduate student in the biophysics department and coordinator of the organization, said that<br />\n\"If there's a vote left, let's get it!\"<br />\nHopkins Students Needed<br />\nThe Stop Mahoney group, in hoping to maintain a<br />\none week sustained campaign, desires to enlist the help<br />\nof many Hopkins students in this fight. They are in<br />\nneed of \"warm bodies and willing workers,\" who will<br />\nachieve their three fold purpose.<br />\nFirst, the group mebers are attempting to get the<br />\nvote out in the City of Baltimore for Spiro T. Agnew,<br />\nRepublican candidate for governor, pointing out the<br />\nfact that Carlton Sickles had been defeated by Mahoney in the primary by some 2,000 votes, or one vote<br />\nper Maryland precinct.<br />\nToo Late For Nine Changing<br />\nSecondly, the Stop Mahoney group realizes as Dobelle<br />\nsays that \"it is too late to start changing peoples'<br />\nminds. We are not planning to get anyone who plans to<br />\nvote for Mahoney to vote for Agnew. No time remains<br />\n1,0 go around changing peoples' minds.\" Instead they<br />\nare concern.ecl with running an all out effort designed<br />\nespecially at 'those districts in the city where voting<br />\nwas light during the primary and where many individuals, especially in the Negro population misinterpreted Mr. Mahoney's slogan that \"Your Home Is Your<br />\nCastle.\"<br />\nThirdly, the group hopes to incite an interest for<br />\nAgnew among Independent Gubernatorial candidate<br />\nHyman Pressman's supporters, hoping to make them<br />\nrealize the dangers which will result in the event of a<br />\nsplit vote including the possibility of a Mahoney victory with less than a voting majority.<br />\n<br />\nThe organization is urging that all interested persons<br />\nattend a special volunteers' meeting at the Charles<br />\nTheatre, 1711 N. Charles Street, on Saturday, October<br />\n29 at 10:00 P.M. Hopkins students are particularly encouraged as the results of this election will have definite<br />\neffects on the nation especially in the area of human<br />\nrights and politics. Among the various jobs to be performed include the canvassing of precincts\u2014on and<br />\nbefore election day\u2014making telephone calls, and working in the group's main headquarters at 25th Street<br />\nand Maryland Avenue.<br />\nThe bipartisan Agnew supporters _decided to support<br />\nthe Republican candidate over Mr. Pressman because<br />\nthey felt that the former was \"eminently qualified\" for<br />\nthe job, and the fact that as Republican organization<br />\ncandidate he immediately starts out with three hundred<br />\nthousand votes and proper financial backing.<br />\n\u2022 Publicity Hound<br />\nIn addition, they consider Pressman \"a publicity<br />\nhound, not the kind of man you want for administrative chief of staff.\"<br />\nThe Washington Post feels that \"Mr. Pressman is<br />\na decent and honest man, but he is not an acceptable<br />\npossibility fcl\u2022 the Governor's chair. He represents, in<br />\ngeneral, an achronistic passion for low cost, low-tax<br />\ngovernment with limited public services. His proposals<br />\nfor legalized gambling and lotteries only open the<br />\nprospect for increased crime and the unhappy social<br />\nside-effects that Southern Maryland encountered with<br />\nits slot machines.\"<br />\nPolicy Positions<br />\nRegarding the policy positions of the two major<br />\ncandidates, Mahoney has, as cited in the Washington<br />\nPost, followed a policy \u2022 of \"persistent refusal . . . to<br />\ntalk about the State's real affairs.\" When he has taken<br />\na stand, he completely evades the issues in regard to<br />\nthe tax problem, transit, crime, and highway safety.<br />\nThe Democratic candidate fails to say how or really<br />\nwhat he plans to do as governor. His only actual stand<br />\nhas been on the question of open housing, which he is<br />\ncompletely against; but even in this area, he has shown<br />\nhis lack of true knowledge of this complex issue?<br />\nMahoney has been recognized as the bosses' candidates.

He may not be considered a devout<br />\nliberal on the question of open housing, but his backing of the recently defeated civil rights bill is, as the<br />\nNew York Times felt, \"distinctly preferable to that of<br />\nMr. Mahoney, whose nomination was largely attributable to a 'white backlash' vote.\"<br />\n<br />\n\fPAGE TWO<br />\n<br />\nNEWS -LETTER<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 28, 1966<br />\n<br />\nElection Results Predicted to Maintain Trends<br />\n<br />\nBy GEOFFREY LEBAR<br />\nMr. Gallup points out that a centralization.

Mahoney is on the verge of succeeding in his perennial<br />\nquest for the governorship of Maryland.<br />\nSupported by the everpresent undercurrent of racial<br />\nprejudice and the recently generated swell of white backlash, the candidacy of Mahoney threatens to introduce<br />\nin to the State House the type of government reminiscent<br />\nof the Reconstruction era.<br />\nUnlike his two opponents, Mahoney has shown himself to be manifestly incapable of presenting_ a sound<br />\nprogram dealing with the issues of state finance, education, pollution control, and transportation. He has succeeded in obscuring these points through his emotional<br />\nappeals for closed housing, and the election will unfortunately hinge on the degree to which his philosophy<br />\nis shared by Maryland voters.<br />\nIn an attempt to overcome Mahoney's apparent appeal to the public, a non-partisan \"Citizens To Stop<br />\nMahoney\" organization has been formed. Its plan is to<br />\ngo into Baltimore precincts where the turnout was light<br />\nin the primary, and to convince the residents to vote<br />\nagainst Mahoney by casting their ballots for the Republican candidate, Spiro T. Agnew.<br />\nIn a state where a plurality of votes is sufficient for<br />\nelection, Mahoney is conceded to have already amassed<br />\nthe support of at least one-third of the electorate. Realizing that Independent Hyman Pressman's support is<br />\nwoefully limited to the Baltimore area, the Stop Mahoney group is playing practical politics and supporting<br />\nAgnew. Pressman, who either does not grasp the full<br />\nmeaning of the situation or is overcome with ambition,<br />\nadamantly refuses to withdraw his candidacy, a move<br />\nwhich would assure majority rule and give the voters a<br />\nclear choice.<br />\nIn order to achieve its goal, the Stop Mahoney<br />\norganization needs volunteers, and has turned to Hopkins students to enlist their all. While we recopize that<br />\nthe majority of students here are from out of town, we<br />\nstill urge that Hopkins heed this request.<br />\nFor one thing, the election has taken on national<br />\nimplications. Indicative of this is Richard Nixon's recent observation that \"the party of Jefferson, Jackson,<br />\nand Wilson has become the party of Maddox, Mahoney,<br />\nand Wallace.\"<br />\nAs a border state, Maryland becomes an important<br />\nbarometer for the fortunes of the enforcement of basic<br />\ncivil rights. While northern politicians may ignore the<br />\nelection of Wallace or Maddox, Alahoney's election would<br />\nserve to restrain enthusiastic furtherance of civil rights.<br />\nThere is yet a more compelling reason. To any student who believes that knowledge must supplant<br />\nprejudice and that freedom should breed responsibility,<br />\nthe candidacy of Mahoney is as gross an insult to him<br />\nas to the Maryland body politic. For Hopkins to remain<br />\npassive in this election is to allow Veritas Vos Liberabit<br />\nto be cruelly mocked by \"Your Home Is Your Castle.\"<br />\nOne need only consider his reaction were Mahoney<br />\nrunning for governor in his own state. That he is doing<br />\nso in Maryland seems to us to be no less a catastrophe<br />\nthan if he were a candidate in Pennsylvania or New York.<br />\n\"The actions of men,\" wrote John Locke, \"are<br />\nthe hest interpreters of their thoughts.\" In volunteering<br />\nto aid the Stop Mahoney group, Hopkins students have<br />\nthe opportunity to play a significant role in the outcome<br />\nof the election, remaining loyal, at least, to the concepts<br />\nfor which the University stands. Should Mahoney be<br />\nelected, no one will ever mistake the government of<br />\nFree State as the embodiment of Truth.<br />\n<br />\nCANUCK! CANUCK!<br />\nAmong its many interests the News-Letter takes it<br />\nupon itself to keep tabs on its brother student publications at Hopkins. We note with a mixture of superiority<br />\nand shame the failure of the current edition of the<br />\nHullabaloo to keep pace with new standards of Journalistic endeavor undertaken by the News-Letter, Vector,<br />\nand Charles Street Review.<br />\nWe might certainly agree that the 1965 Hullabaloo<br />\nwas a hard act to follow. It combined a new size and<br />\ncreative layout with a high standard of photography to<br />\nproduce the most memorably excellent yearbook in the<br />\nrecorded history of yearbooks.<br />\nNevertheless for the editors of the 1966 Hullabaloo<br />\nto attempt to erase the fine memory of their predecessor<br />\nby producing 200 pages of cliche was as disappointing as<br />\nit was dull.<br />\nThis, however, is no reason not to pick it up since<br />\nmost of you have already paid for it and next year is<br />\nanother year as tomorrow is another day, or something<br />\nlike that.<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 28, 1960<br />\n<br />\nlite alkeinewead Scene<br />\n<br />\nBorn Rich<br />\nWhile glancing through the<br />\neducation section of the voluminous Sunday Times last week, this<br />\nreporter stumbled upon a startling fact. Amidst the great competitive maelstrom of modern<br />\nacademe, amidst the selective and<br />\nsuper selective schools that one<br />\nlinks with higher education in<br />\nAmerica, is a group of schools<br />\nthat advertise. It's true. They run<br />\nglorious ads in the New York<br />\nTimes telling of air conditioned<br />\nclassrooms and swimming and<br />\nmaid service, and degrees even,<br />\nand all without the anxiety of<br />\ncompetion or the trouble of taking great banks of multiple<br />\nchoice brain teasers.<br />\nFor the price of a postage<br />\nstamp one can bid for a seat<br />\nat the Pumblechook College of<br />\nMining and Dentistry, sip from<br />\nthe springs of scholarship at<br />\nPowhaten J.C., or sup at the seat<br />\nof success amidst the ivy covered walls of Balaclava Academy<br />\nof Music and Dressmaking. These<br />\nschools are seldom filled to<br />\ncapacity, and bring truth to the<br />\ngreat egalitarian maxim that<br />\neveryone can find a place in<br />\ncollege.<br />\n<br />\nplications. They have been advertising covertly for years, in the<br />\nform of speakers and films sent<br />\nto high schools, and it's only a<br />\nmatter of time, this reporter<br />\nfeels, until the mass media are<br />\nbesieged with college ads that<br />\nmay sound a bit like this:<br />\n<br />\nShe: Only a handshake, never<br />\na good night kiss, why is it<br />\nthat Jim doesn't like me?<br />\nWith the end of the post war<br />\nCould I have bad breath?<br />\nboom babies' siege on American<br />\nFriend:<br />\nWell, you asked, so I'll<br />\nCollege Campuses and the actell you.

In short, even allowing for generalization it is not<br />\nan especially pretty picture.<br />\nIn light of this, the First International Structural Symposium must be counted as an important<br />\nevent for<br />\nWestern<br />\nAcademe. While a direct assessment of the speeches and dialogues of the Oct. 18-21 symposium is foolhardy without the<br />\naid of reflective retrospection<br />\n(the proceedings will be published next year by the Hopkins<br />\nPress), the symposium succeeded\u2014according to Prof. Richard<br />\nMacksey\u2014most invaluably on the<br />\nelemental level of communication. Philosophers, literary critics, sociologists, linguists, and anthropologilts were given their<br />\nfirst chance to explore a not-soold movement which is now emerging in a clearer focus on both<br />\nan inter-disciplinary and transatlantic basis.<br />\nExamples<br />\nThe problem of defining structuralism is a decidely heady one.<br />\nWhile not begging the question,<br />\nit can be said that there is no<br />\nclear cut \"structuralism,\" but<br />\nrather<br />\nstructuralisms.<br />\nmany<br />\nThough all, the disciplines present<br />\nare interested in what C.

In the<br />\npast sixteen years he has made six attempts to gain<br />\npublic office. His only conquest has been a seat on<br />\nthe Maryland State Racing Commission, held in the<br />\n1.940's. A curiosity in the present election, (Mahoney's<br />\nSeventh), is that a man so enveloped by politics should<br />\napparently lack an entourage of committed supporters.<br />\ntIowhem can we find the \"Mahoney organization\", the<br />\n*Mahoney men\". His headquarters lack the starryeyed young girls folding letters and answering the<br />\nphone (it seldom rings). The billboard and bumper<br />\nSticker advertisements are sparse. Testimonial banquets,<br />\ntelevision appearances and rallies have been confined<br />\nto the Republicans.<br />\nMahoney claims that he isn't running against another<br />\ncandidate but against the present condition \"of things\".<br />\nTherefore he needs no political alliances or wham-bha.m<br />\nCampaigns.\"The great body politic knows where George<br />\n\u201eMahoney stands.\" One must wonder whether this is the<br />\nCase or was Mahoney left to fend for himself by the<br />\nembarrassed political chieftains.<br />\nControls Districts<br />\nThe most powerful political \"boss\" In Baltimore is<br />\ndames H. (Jack) Pollack. His \"Trenton Democratic<br />\nClub\" controls the Fourth and Fifth Districts in Baltimore City, and branches occasionally into contested<br />\nterritory. He has manipulated elections, the Baltimore<br />\nCity Council and an occasional judge for three decades.<br />\nFor two decades George Mahoney and Jack Pollack<br />\nMillard<br />\nhave been close political allies united against<br />\nundesirable<br />\nMahoney<br />\nmade<br />\noften<br />\nunion<br />\nTawes. This<br />\nHyman Pressin the eyes of political \"moralists\" like<br />\neffective<br />\nman but Pollack's support was a coveted and<br />\nprize.<br />\nseems<br />\nPollack's participation in the present campaign<br />\nof some hankyto be minimal. There have been reports<br />\nPollack<br />\npanky in the primary but it doesn't seem that<br />\nit.<br />\nin<br />\nheart<br />\nhis<br />\nhas<br />\nPollack's<br />\nMahoney might rightfully feel cheated bydistributed<br />\nsupport. As yet no sample ballots have been<br />\nthere's reasonin the Fourth and Fifth Districts and<br />\nPollack is<br />\nable doubt Mahoney would head them. If<br />\nthe<br />\nspending money today like he did in 1958 when<br />\nthis<br />\ndoes<br />\nit<br />\n(as<br />\nMaryland<br />\nignoring<br />\nflational party was<br />\nfar Marear), then it isn't evident to the public. So<br />\nfinanced from<br />\nhoney's campaign could easily have been<br />\nhis own pocket.<br />\nPollack Hesitant<br />\npossibilities<br />\nWhy would Pollack be so hesitant? Two<br />\nDemocratic<br />\nTrenton<br />\nthe<br />\ncomprising<br />\ndistricts<br />\narise. The<br />\nJews<br />\nClub are dominated by Negroes (the Fourth) and<br />\n.(the Fifth). Pollack would have to spend a lot of<br />\nfavors within his own family to whip up support for<br />\nMahoney and his crusade against open-occupancy.<br />\nThe second reason, related to the first, is that Pollack's power source is declining rapidly. Not only is he<br />\nhesitant to exhaust it, but it is possible that his next<br />\nmistake will be his last and Mahoney offers little security. Attorney-General Finan has labeled Mahoney's<br />\ncampaign \"Pollack's last stand.\"<br />\nWith the figureheads of the Democratic party (Tydtngs, Brewster, Tawes, Sickles) avoiding Mahoney. the<br />\ntack of organiZational support \u2022leaves the Democratic<br />\nnominee one alternative\u2014the people. There is no need<br />\ntor Mahoney to energetically campaign if the people<br />\nalrady know (in their hearts?) that he is right. He<br />\ndoesn't have to discuss the issues, confront his opponents or spend a lot of money.<br />\nOn the other hand, with a glaring absence of supporters. did he ever have the choice?<br /><br />\npLuRYING.

MAHONEY<br /><br />\nGroup Formed To Stop Mahoney;<br />\nSeeks Volunteers From Hopkins<br />\nBy DENN-I ESTIS<br />\n\"Democrats may have nominated for Governor one<br />\nof the worst racist bigots in the history of Maryland<br />\npolitics.\" This opinion was expressed by James Reston,<br />\nveteran New York Times columnist, in his description<br />\nthe Democratic candidate for governor, George P. Mahoney, on October 9.<br />\nSimilar statements have been echoed by many diverse national organizations including the Americans<br />\nfor Democratic Action, The New Republic, The Washington Post, and the New York Tines.<br />\nTowson State Demonstrations<br />\nSpurred on by recent racist demonstrations held by<br />\nthe National States Rights Party and the Klu Klux<br />\nKlan at Towson State College in support of Mr. Mahoney, several concerned Johns Hopkins University<br />\ngraduate studentsDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents\u2014deciding that a Mahoney win was a distinct<br />\npossibility, formed an independent organization devoid<br />\nof the Republican and Democratic partisanship called<br />\nthe Citizens To Stop Mahoney.<br />\nThe new group's philosophy is to get every possible<br />\nvoter out in a last determined move. William Dobelle,<br />\na Hopkins graduate student in the biophysics department and coordinator of the organization, said that<br />\n\"If there's a vote left, let's get it!\"<br />\nHopkins Students Needed<br />\nThe Stop Mahoney group, in hoping to maintain a<br />\none week sustained campaign, desires to enlist the help<br />\nof many Hopkins students in this fight. They are in<br />\nneed of \"warm bodies and willing workers,\" who will<br />\nachieve their three fold purpose.<br />\nFirst, the group mebers are attempting to get the<br />\nvote out in the City of Baltimore for Spiro T. Agnew,<br />\nRepublican candidate for governor, pointing out the<br />\nfact that Carlton Sickles had been defeated by Mahoney in the primary by some 2,000 votes, or one vote<br />\nper Maryland precinct.<br />\nToo Late For Nine Changing<br />\nSecondly, the Stop Mahoney group realizes as Dobelle<br />\nsays that \"it is too late to start changing peoples'<br />\nminds. We are not planning to get anyone who plans to<br />\nvote for Mahoney to vote for Agnew. No time remains<br />\n1,0 go around changing peoples' minds.\" Instead they<br />\nare concern.ecl with running an all out effort designed<br />\nespecially at 'those districts in the city where voting<br />\nwas light during the primary and where many individuals, especially in the Negro population misinterpreted Mr. Mahoney's slogan that \"Your Home Is Your<br />\nCastle.\"<br />\nThirdly, the group hopes to incite an interest for<br />\nAgnew among Independent Gubernatorial candidate<br />\nHyman Pressman's supporters, hoping to make them<br />\nrealize the dangers which will result in the event of a<br />\nsplit vote including the possibility of a Mahoney victory with less than a voting majority.<br /><br />\nThe organization is urging that all interested persons<br />\nattend a special volunteers' meeting at the Charles<br />\nTheatre, 1711 N. Charles Street, on Saturday, October<br />\n29 at 10:00 P.M. Hopkins students are particularly encouraged as the results of this election will have definite<br />\neffects on the nation especially in the area of human<br />\nrights and politics. Among the various jobs to be performed include the canvassing of precincts\u2014on and<br />\nbefore election day\u2014making telephone calls, and working in the group's main headquarters at 25th Street<br />\nand Maryland Avenue.<br />\nThe bipartisan Agnew supporters _decided to support<br />\nthe Republican candidate over Mr. Pressman because<br />\nthey felt that the former was \"eminently qualified\" for<br />\nthe job, and the fact that as Republican organization<br />\ncandidate he immediately starts out with three hundred<br />\nthousand votes and proper financial backing.<br />\n\u2022 Publicity Hound<br />\nIn addition, they consider Pressman \"a publicity<br />\nhound, not the kind of man you want for administrative chief of staff.\"<br />\nThe Washington Post feels that \"Mr. Pressman is<br />\na decent and honest man, but he is not an acceptable<br />\npossibility fcl\u2022 the Governor's chair. He represents, in<br />\ngeneral, an achronistic passion for low cost, low-tax<br />\ngovernment with limited public services. His proposals<br />\nfor legalized gambling and lotteries only open the<br />\nprospect for increased crime and the unhappy social<br />\nside-effects that Southern Maryland encountered with<br />\nits slot machines.\"<br />\nPolicy Positions<br />\nRegarding the policy positions of the two major<br />\ncandidates, Mahoney has, as cited in the Washington<br />\nPost, followed a policy \u2022 of \"persistent refusal . . . to<br />\ntalk about the State's real affairs.\" When he has taken<br />\na stand, he completely evades the issues in regard to<br />\nthe tax problem, transit, crime, and highway safety.<br />\nThe Democratic candidate fails to say how or really<br />\nwhat he plans to do as governor. His only actual stand<br />\nhas been on the question of open housing, which he is<br />\ncompletely against; but even in this area, he has shown<br />\nhis lack of true knowledge of this complex issue?<br />\nMahoney has been recognized as the bosses' candidates.

Mahoney is on the verge of succeeding in his perennial<br />\nquest for the governorship of Maryland.<br />\nSupported by the everpresent undercurrent of racial<br />\nprejudice and the recently generated swell of white backlash, the candidacy of Mahoney threatens to introduce<br />\nin to the State House the type of government reminiscent<br />\nof the Reconstruction era.<br />\nUnlike his two opponents, Mahoney has shown himself to be manifestly incapable of presenting_ a sound<br />\nprogram dealing with the issues of state finance, education, pollution control, and transportation. He has succeeded in obscuring these points through his emotional<br />\nappeals for closed housing, and the election will unfortunately hinge on the degree to which his philosophy<br />\nis shared by Maryland voters.<br />\nIn an attempt to overcome Mahoney's apparent appeal to the public, a non-partisan \"Citizens To Stop<br />\nMahoney\" organization has been formed. Its plan is to<br />\ngo into Baltimore precincts where the turnout was light<br />\nin the primary, and to convince the residents to vote<br />\nagainst Mahoney by casting their ballots for the Republican candidate, Spiro T. Agnew.<br />\nIn a state where a plurality of votes is sufficient for<br />\nelection, Mahoney is conceded to have already amassed<br />\nthe support of at least one-third of the electorate. Realizing that Independent Hyman Pressman's support is<br />\nwoefully limited to the Baltimore area, the Stop Mahoney group is playing practical politics and supporting<br />\nAgnew. Pressman, who either does not grasp the full<br />\nmeaning of the situation or is overcome with ambition,<br />\nadamantly refuses to withdraw his candidacy, a move<br />\nwhich would assure majority rule and give the voters a<br />\nclear choice.<br />\nIn order to achieve its goal, the Stop Mahoney<br />\norganization needs volunteers, and has turned to Hopkins students to enlist their all. While we recopize that<br />\nthe majority of students here are from out of town, we<br />\nstill urge that Hopkins heed this request.<br />\nFor one thing, the election has taken on national<br />\nimplications. Indicative of this is Richard Nixon's recent observation that \"the party of Jefferson, Jackson,<br />\nand Wilson has become the party of Maddox, Mahoney,<br />\nand Wallace.\"<br />\nAs a border state, Maryland becomes an important<br />\nbarometer for the fortunes of the enforcement of basic<br />\ncivil rights. While northern politicians may ignore the<br />\nelection of Wallace or Maddox, Alahoney's election would<br />\nserve to restrain enthusiastic furtherance of civil rights.<br />\nThere is yet a more compelling reason. To any student who believes that knowledge must supplant<br />\nprejudice and that freedom should breed responsibility,<br />\nthe candidacy of Mahoney is as gross an insult to him<br />\nas to the Maryland body politic. For Hopkins to remain<br />\npassive in this election is to allow Veritas Vos Liberabit<br />\nto be cruelly mocked by \"Your Home Is Your Castle.\"<br />\nOne need only consider his reaction were Mahoney<br />\nrunning for governor in his own state. That he is doing<br />\nso in Maryland seems to us to be no less a catastrophe<br />\nthan if he were a candidate in Pennsylvania or New York.<br />\n\"The actions of men,\" wrote John Locke, \"are<br />\nthe hest interpreters of their thoughts.\" In volunteering<br />\nto aid the Stop Mahoney group, Hopkins students have<br />\nthe opportunity to play a significant role in the outcome<br />\nof the election, remaining loyal, at least, to the concepts<br />\nfor which the University stands. Should Mahoney be<br />\nelected, no one will ever mistake the government of<br />\nFree State as the embodiment of Truth.<br /><br />\nCANUCK! CANUCK!<br />\nAmong its many interests the News-Letter takes it<br />\nupon itself to keep tabs on its brother student publications at Hopkins. We note with a mixture of superiority<br />\nand shame the failure of the current edition of the<br />\nHullabaloo to keep pace with new standards of Journalistic endeavor undertaken by the News-Letter, Vector,<br />\nand Charles Street Review.<br />\nWe might certainly agree that the 1965 Hullabaloo<br />\nwas a hard act to follow. It combined a new size and<br />\ncreative layout with a high standard of photography to<br />\nproduce the most memorably excellent yearbook in the<br />\nrecorded history of yearbooks.<br />\nNevertheless for the editors of the 1966 Hullabaloo<br />\nto attempt to erase the fine memory of their predecessor<br />\nby producing 200 pages of cliche was as disappointing as<br />\nit was dull.<br />\nThis, however, is no reason not to pick it up since<br />\nmost of you have already paid for it and next year is<br />\nanother year as tomorrow is another day, or something<br />\nlike that.<br /><br />\nI<br /><br />\nHOMEWOOD, BALTIMORE, OCTOBER 28, 1960<br /><br />\nlite alkeinewead Scene<br /><br />\nBorn Rich<br />\nWhile glancing through the<br />\neducation section of the voluminous Sunday Times last week, this<br />\nreporter stumbled upon a startling fact. Amidst the great competitive maelstrom of modern<br />\nacademe, amidst the selective and<br />\nsuper selective schools that one<br />\nlinks with higher education in<br />\nAmerica, is a group of schools<br />\nthat advertise. It's true. They run<br />\nglorious ads in the New York<br />\nTimes telling of air conditioned<br />\nclassrooms and swimming and<br />\nmaid service, and degrees even,<br />\nand all without the anxiety of<br />\ncompetion or the trouble of taking great banks of multiple<br />\nchoice brain teasers.<br />\nFor the price of a postage<br />\nstamp one can bid for a seat<br />\nat the Pumblechook College of<br />\nMining and Dentistry, sip from<br />\nthe springs of scholarship at<br />\nPowhaten J.C., or sup at the seat<br />\nof success amidst the ivy covered walls of Balaclava Academy<br />\nof Music and Dressmaking. These<br />\nschools are seldom filled to<br />\ncapacity, and bring truth to the<br />\ngreat egalitarian maxim that<br />\neveryone can find a place in<br />\ncollege.<br /><br />\nplications. They have been advertising covertly for years, in the<br />\nform of speakers and films sent<br />\nto high schools, and it's only a<br />\nmatter of time, this reporter<br />\nfeels, until the mass media are<br />\nbesieged with college ads that<br />\nmay sound a bit like this:<br /><br />\nShe: Only a handshake, never<br />\na good night kiss, why is it<br />\nthat Jim doesn't like me?<br />\nWith the end of the post war<br />\nCould I have bad breath?<br />\nboom babies' siege on American<br />\nFriend:<br />\nWell, you asked, so I'll<br />\nCollege Campuses and the actell you.

In short, even allowing for generalization it is not<br />\nan especially pretty picture.<br />\nIn light of this, the First International Structural Symposium must be counted as an important<br />\nevent for<br />\nWestern<br />\nAcademe. While a direct assessment of the speeches and dialogues of the Oct. 18-21 symposium is foolhardy without the<br />\naid of reflective retrospection<br />\n(the proceedings will be published next year by the Hopkins<br />\nPress), the symposium succeeded\u2014according to Prof. Richard<br />\nMacksey\u2014most invaluably on the<br />\nelemental level of communication.
