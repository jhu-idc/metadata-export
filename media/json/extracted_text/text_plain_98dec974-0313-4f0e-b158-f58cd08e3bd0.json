Cleveland<br />\n<br />\nA Pat On Our Back<br />\nThe News-Letter's stand against racial injustices in<br />\nthe city of Baltimore has been and still is quite clear and<br />\nunequivocal. We do not feel if necessary to restate our<br />\nposition at this time. We do, however, wish to take this<br />\nopportunity to gloat at the resounding success of the<br />\nmilitant sit-in movement in Baltimore and America and<br />\nthe part we have played in it.<br />\nStudents of the Johns Hopkins University have been<br />\ngiven credit by the Baltimore Urban League for initiating<br />\nthe Baltimore integration movement. It was two years<br />\nago in February that the first sit-in in Baltimore, initiated<br />\nprimarily by white students, was incubated. The NewsLetter had revealed to a largely ignorant campus the<br />\nfacts of the appalling conditions of racial intolerance<br />\ntoward both Negroes and foreign students in Homewood's<br />\nsurrounding neighborhood. Shortly afterward a somewhat weak and disorganized sit-in was held at the BlueJay Restaurant. It was bound to fail, but it accomplished<br />\none important objective. The relatively docile Baltimore<br />\nNegro community was shamed into action. Quite soon<br />\nthe Civic Interest Group became extremely active and<br />\nbegan to steamroll through racial barriers that have<br />\nstood for decades.<br />\nIn less than two years since that sit-in, Baltimore's<br />\nNegro community has acquired more of the rights and<br />\ndignity due to first-class American citizens than they have<br />\nin decades of indifference. The difference is striking to<br />\neven the most casual observer.<br />\nThe events of the last week convince us beyond<br />\ndoubt of the efficacy of the sit-in movement and passive<br />\nresistance. We refer to the now internationally infamous<br />\nU.S. Route 40. Urgent desegregation pleas by the United<br />\nStates Department of State to some eighty restaurants<br />\nalong this well travelled route went all but unheeded.<br />\nHowever, the mere threat of hundreds of Freedom Riders<br />\ninvading their establishments was enough to induce<br />\nthirty-five proprietors to open their services to all persons. Without doubt the passive resistance movement<br />\nstrikes fear in the hearts of people imbued with the<br />\nantiquated and outdated traditions of their forefathers.<br />\nToo fast? Nonsense, we submit. If one regards<br />\nthe rapid decline of American prestige abroad in today's<br />\nworld of dynamic change, then there is no such thing as<br />\ngoing \"too fast\" in this area.<br />\nDespite the harsh criticism leveled at the News-Letter<br />\nfor \"instigating\" action of this sort, we remain proud of<br />\nthe minor, but still significant role we have played in<br />\nthis vital and changing time.<br />\n<br />\nStop and Think<br />\nThe apparent conflict between the DSRC and the<br />\nSC over the question of judicial systems seems to be based<br />\nmore on misunderstanding than any real disagreement.<br />\nThe DSRC,recognizing the need for a revision of its<br />\njudicial processes, has proceeded to set up the plans for<br />\na new judicial board within the dormitories. The SC in<br />\na parallel action has begun a constitutional revision which<br />\nincludes the establishment of a non-academic judicial<br />\nboard.<br />\nThe position of the DSRC in respect to the Student<br />\nCouncil's action is quite simple. It is moving forward<br />\nwith its plans and will establish a new judicial board<br />\nwhich will function until superseded by a larger group<br />\nestablished by the SC. Until this campus-wide judicial<br />\nboard begins operation, which will probably not be until<br />\nnext year, the DSRC will have the benefits of its new<br />\njudicial process.<br />\nIt is quite apparent that if the DSRC heeds the Student Council demand to stop its plans, it will have to use<br />\nits admittedly defective judicial system for a full year.<br />\nThis would be a grave injustice to the dormitory residents.<br />\nTherefore, we urge the Student Council to rescind its<br />\nmisguided instructions to the DSRC and avoid needless<br />\ncontroversy which will serve no purpose and create no<br />\ngood.<br />\n<br />\nFun Day Sunnles<br />\nA word of , commendation is in order.

Until 1910 it did not even<br />\nexist, and from the founding of the University,<br />\nin 1876, until 1875, courses in philosophy were<br />\ncomparatively rare\u2014in accordance with President Gilman's notion that such a subject was<br />\nuseful only as a moral and logical preparation<br />\nfor scientific research.<br />\nPresident Gilman's academic policy was significant in bringing about the resignation of two<br />\neminent professors of Hopkins' early days\u2014<br />\nGeorge Sylvester Morris and Charles Saunders<br />\nPeirce. These two, aided by John Dewey and<br />\nJosiah Royce, taught the University's first course<br />\nin philosophy, a mixture of \"Logic, Psychology,<br />\nand Ethics.\" The linking of philosophy was<br />\nanother of Gilman's ideas that helped keep<br />\nphilosophy in the background until the appointment of Arthur 0.

Because of this constant<br />\nMelancholia which seemed to<br />\ncarry him through the play, the<br />\nevolution of Orestes' character,<br />\nfrom a sarcastic youth to a serious adult trapped in the hands<br />\nof fate, did not ring true.

The Marxist - Leninist - Communist Party<br />\nwill never give up these six<br />\ntenets. It will never worship God<br />\nor cease to fight and persecute<br />\nthose who do; it will never re-<br />\n<br />\npudiate the class struggle; it<br />\nwill never allow political freedom; it will never view the human person as an end in himself; it will never cease inciting<br />\nthe proletariat all over the<br />\nworld; and it will never settle for<br />\nless than the whole world.

Cleveland<br /><br />\nA Pat On Our Back<br />\nThe News-Letter's stand against racial injustices in<br />\nthe city of Baltimore has been and still is quite clear and<br />\nunequivocal. We do not feel if necessary to restate our<br />\nposition at this time. We do, however, wish to take this<br />\nopportunity to gloat at the resounding success of the<br />\nmilitant sit-in movement in Baltimore and America and<br />\nthe part we have played in it.<br />\nStudents of the Johns Hopkins University have been<br />\ngiven credit by the Baltimore Urban League for initiating<br />\nthe Baltimore integration movement. It was two years<br />\nago in February that the first sit-in in Baltimore, initiated<br />\nprimarily by white students, was incubated. The NewsLetter had revealed to a largely ignorant campus the<br />\nfacts of the appalling conditions of racial intolerance<br />\ntoward both Negroes and foreign students in Homewood's<br />\nsurrounding neighborhood. Shortly afterward a somewhat weak and disorganized sit-in was held at the BlueJay Restaurant. It was bound to fail, but it accomplished<br />\none important objective. The relatively docile Baltimore<br />\nNegro community was shamed into action. Quite soon<br />\nthe Civic Interest Group became extremely active and<br />\nbegan to steamroll through racial barriers that have<br />\nstood for decades.<br />\nIn less than two years since that sit-in, Baltimore's<br />\nNegro community has acquired more of the rights and<br />\ndignity due to first-class American citizens than they have<br />\nin decades of indifference. The difference is striking to<br />\neven the most casual observer.<br />\nThe events of the last week convince us beyond<br />\ndoubt of the efficacy of the sit-in movement and passive<br />\nresistance. We refer to the now internationally infamous<br />\nU.S. Route 40. Urgent desegregation pleas by the United<br />\nStates Department of State to some eighty restaurants<br />\nalong this well travelled route went all but unheeded.<br />\nHowever, the mere threat of hundreds of Freedom Riders<br />\ninvading their establishments was enough to induce<br />\nthirty-five proprietors to open their services to all persons. Without doubt the passive resistance movement<br />\nstrikes fear in the hearts of people imbued with the<br />\nantiquated and outdated traditions of their forefathers.<br />\nToo fast? Nonsense, we submit. If one regards<br />\nthe rapid decline of American prestige abroad in today's<br />\nworld of dynamic change, then there is no such thing as<br />\ngoing \"too fast\" in this area.<br />\nDespite the harsh criticism leveled at the News-Letter<br />\nfor \"instigating\" action of this sort, we remain proud of<br />\nthe minor, but still significant role we have played in<br />\nthis vital and changing time.<br /><br />\nStop and Think<br />\nThe apparent conflict between the DSRC and the<br />\nSC over the question of judicial systems seems to be based<br />\nmore on misunderstanding than any real disagreement.<br />\nThe DSRC,recognizing the need for a revision of its<br />\njudicial processes, has proceeded to set up the plans for<br />\na new judicial board within the dormitories. The SC in<br />\na parallel action has begun a constitutional revision which<br />\nincludes the establishment of a non-academic judicial<br />\nboard.<br />\nThe position of the DSRC in respect to the Student<br />\nCouncil's action is quite simple. It is moving forward<br />\nwith its plans and will establish a new judicial board<br />\nwhich will function until superseded by a larger group<br />\nestablished by the SC. Until this campus-wide judicial<br />\nboard begins operation, which will probably not be until<br />\nnext year, the DSRC will have the benefits of its new<br />\njudicial process.<br />\nIt is quite apparent that if the DSRC heeds the Student Council demand to stop its plans, it will have to use<br />\nits admittedly defective judicial system for a full year.<br />\nThis would be a grave injustice to the dormitory residents.<br />\nTherefore, we urge the Student Council to rescind its<br />\nmisguided instructions to the DSRC and avoid needless<br />\ncontroversy which will serve no purpose and create no<br />\ngood.<br /><br />\nFun Day Sunnles<br />\nA word of , commendation is in order.

Until 1910 it did not even<br />\nexist, and from the founding of the University,<br />\nin 1876, until 1875, courses in philosophy were<br />\ncomparatively rare\u2014in accordance with President Gilman's notion that such a subject was<br />\nuseful only as a moral and logical preparation<br />\nfor scientific research.<br />\nPresident Gilman's academic policy was significant in bringing about the resignation of two<br />\neminent professors of Hopkins' early days\u2014<br />\nGeorge Sylvester Morris and Charles Saunders<br />\nPeirce.

A certain fright and timidity, a certain false modesty, has assailed<br />\nthem. Even if at times they find<br />\nthemselves apologizing for some<br />\nshameful fact\u2014and shame and<br />\napology could be signs of spiritual strength\u2014they nevertheless<br />\nappear to forget that in every<br />\nsphere of life the offensive, if<br />\ngenuinely mounted, is the best<br />\nmeans of self-defense.\"<br />\n\"After saying two or at most<br />\nthree sentences on economic and<br />\nsocial questions, or perhaps even<br />\nbefore saying them, we should<br />\nbe in a moral-existential position<br />\nourselves to turn to the Communists and say: 'What about freedom of thought and inquiry in<br />\nyour realm? Can people seek<br />\ntruth really freely? Can they<br />\nreally dissent? Can they really<br />\nquestion your fundamental positions? What about freedom of<br />\nreligion? Do you Communists go<br />\nto Church? Do you fall on your<br />\nknees and pray? And why do you<br />\npersecute those who do? What<br />\nabout human rights and fundamental freedoms?'\u2014It ir most<br />\nimportant that the total arsenal<br />\nof political, moral and spiritual<br />\nvalues be brought to bear upon<br />\nthis struggle.\"<br /><br />\nHopkins Receives<br />\n$18 Million In Aid<br />\nLast year Johns Hopkins received almost 18 million dollars<br />\nin support from various sources<br />\nplacing Hopkihs fourth in the<br />\ncatagory of private colleges.<br />\nWhere do these millions of dollars come from?<br />\nAt Hopkins, as at most colleges, there are four kinds of<br />\nsupport: (1) from foundations,<br />\n(2) from corporations, (3) from<br />\nalumni, (4) from non-alumni<br />\nfriends.<br /><br />\nJohns Hopkins Receives<br />\nHavens Estate Residue<br />\nUnder the terms of the will of<br />\nthe late Professor Raymond D.<br />\nHavens, Johns Hopkins University has received the residue of<br />\nhis estate which is in excess of<br />\n$50,000.<br />\nProfessor Havens requested<br />\nthat the final residue of his<br />\nestate be given by his executors<br />\nto the Johns Hopkins University<br />\nfor its library.
