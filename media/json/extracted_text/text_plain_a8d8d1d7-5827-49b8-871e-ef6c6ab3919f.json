William<br />\nAppelbaum, assistant dean of<br />\nfinance for the medical school.<br />\nThe deficit will be incurred<br />\nmostly by the construction costs<br />\nof several new facilities, including the Asthma Center, the<br />\nAmbulatory Care Unit, the<br />\nRutland Avenue Building, and, to<br />\na lesser extent, the Huntarian<br />\nBuilding, according to University Senior Vice President Eugene<br />\nSunshine. Additional costs of<br />\noperating and maintaining these<br />\nbuildings will also contribute to<br />\nthe deficit.<br />\n\"What happens is, in a<br />\nrelatively short period of time,<br />\nyou have a very large additional<br />\ncost being incurred on the School<br />\nof Medicine by these buildings,\"<br />\nsaid Sunshine.<br />\nThe Rutland Building, for example, carries a $98 million price<br />\ntag, while the Ambulatory Care<br />\nUnit's expected cost is $140<br />\n<br />\nmillion. The buildings are being<br />\nfinanced through a payment<br />\nschedule not unlike a mortgage,<br />\nwith debt service payments totalling $30 million per year for the<br />\nnext four years, Sunshine said.<br />\nPart of the cost will be covered<br />\nby the profits from the school's<br />\nclinical operations, not to be confused with the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, which maintains a<br />\nseparate budget. The balance, or<br />\nnet deficit, expected to accumulate between 1991 and 1993<br />\nwill be $31 million (see table).<br />\nOnce the projects are completed, the medical school will<br />\nstart to realize revenue from services that will be provided in the<br />\nnew buildings. The Ambulatory<br />\nCare Unit, for example, will<br />\nallow the school to see more patients, and the Rutland Building<br />\nwill primarily be used for contractual medical research, said<br />\nSunshine.<br />\n\"Ultimately, the revenue side<br />\nwill be enhanced to more than<br />\npay for those costs,\" Sunshine<br />\nsaid.

Calling this session a<br />\n\"booster shot\" to start the<br />\nlisteners on the road to being<br />\nassertive, she defined assertive in<br />\nterms of handling relationships<br />\n<br />\nwith confidence, looking out for<br />\none's self-interest while considering others, and being able to tell<br />\nthe truth about any situation.<br />\nThe beginning of overcoming<br />\nthe barriers of feeling like you<br />\nhave \"no skill\" or \"no right to<br />\nstand up for yourself\u2014 claimed<br />\nStrang was \"feeling fundamentally pretty good about yourself.\"<br />\nShe went on to differentiate<br />\nbetwen assertive, aggressive, and<br />\nnon-assertive behavior types,<br />\nconcluding that only selfassertion puts people in a \"win<br />\nsituation\" in which they can<br />\nreach their goals.<br />\nStrang then had the entire audience stand up and introduce<br />\nthemselves to one other person<br />\npresent at the lecture. Audience<br />\nmembers were instructed to give<br />\ntheir name and one word to<br />\npositively describe themselves.<br />\nThe attributes ranged from \"fun\"<br />\nto \"happy,\" as people tried out<br />\ntheir self-confidence.<br />\nUrging everyone to think<br />\npositively about himself or<br />\nherself, Strang proposed basic<br />\nguidelines for assertiveness, including to use \"I-statements,\"<br />\nmake factual comments, not accusations, and to always accept<br />\nownership of ones own feelings.<br />\nThe opening speaker suggested<br />\nthat this was the way to deal in<br />\nthe 1990s and encouraged those<br />\nattending to continue on a tenweek assertive behavior training<br />\nprogram.<br />\n<br />\nENTERTAINMENT, from 2<br />\nThe Entertainment Council is<br />\nnow responsible for providing<br />\nstand-by emergency units in addition to First Aid Squad personnel at large-scale events such as<br />\nfor the April event. Security will<br />\nconsist of Hopkins security services and student monitors.<br />\nDirector of Student Activities<br />\nBill Smedick said: \"I endorse this<br />\nEntertainment Council wholeheartedly for two reasons: first,<br />\nbecause it increases student involvement on campus and that in<br />\nturn helps to build community;<br />\nand secondly, if we get more involved in the events, we eliminate<br />\nthe use of middlemen and promoters who traditionally get the<br />\nmoney. We can put this money<br />\nback in our programs if we can<br />\nbe independent of these<br />\nmiddlemen.\"<br />\nDean Colombo agreed, but<br />\n<br />\nstressed that \"questions about<br />\nhow they plan to finance theit<br />\nidea still haven't been clearly<br />\nanswered.\"<br />\n\"I think Charles and Howie<br />\nhave done a tremendous job. This<br />\nis a positive step for us to get a<br />\nbetter feel for what the students<br />\nat Hopkins want as far as quality<br />\nentertainment,\" Dean Colombo<br />\nsaid. \"Overall, it's a good plan.<br />\nThere still are a lot of areas that<br />\nneed to be ironed out, though.\"<br />\nSatisfying the students' needs<br />\nis exactly the purpose of the new<br />\nEntertainment Council, according<br />\nto its designers.<br />\n\"In a time of uncertainty and<br />\nchange, such as we face now with<br />\nthe revision of the financial structure of the University, with the<br />\n5-year plan, and with the search<br />\nfor the new president, this is a<br />\nconcrete gesture to better the<br />\nquality of student life on campus,\" Stewart said.<br />\n<br />\nSpring Fair date changed<br />\nCOUNCIL, from 1<br />\naccording to Larkin.<br />\nMajor Larkin reported that the<br />\nSecurity Department was having<br />\nsome difficulty in finding drivers<br />\nfor the new shuttle. The student<br />\ndrivers who were present at the.<br />\nmeeting suggested that the late<br />\nhours, low pay, and verbal abuse<br />\nfrom the passengers might<br />\ndiscourage possible job applicants. The Student Council<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of subsidizing the drivers' payments if<br />\nthe University will not meet their<br />\nneeds in order to guarantee the<br />\nsafety of the students.<br />\nThe Student Council expressed some concern that the<br />\nUniversity-owned apartments<br />\nwere not considered part of the<br />\ncampus and therefore were not<br />\nwithin the bounds of the shuttle<br />\nservice. Council members<br />\nasserted that students may risk<br />\ntheir own security by walking to<br />\nthe designated boarding location<br />\n<br />\nby the MSE Library. Major<br />\nLarkin and the student drivers<br />\nsuggested that the policy was<br />\nmerely an attempt to discourage<br />\nthe use of the shuttles as a taxi<br />\nservice. Student Council President Lou Giangiulio agreed, saying, \"The students should be<br />\nresponsible users of the vans.\"<br />\nThe Security Department has<br />\nalso implemented a temporary<br />\npolicy which prevents the<br />\noperator from issuing ETAs,<br />\nleaving the times and order of the<br />\npickups to the discretion of the<br />\ndriver. Major Larkin stressed that<br />\nstudents should wait indoors for<br />\nthe vans because of the variable<br />\narrival times.<br />\nSarah Christiano, a freshman<br />\nrepresentative, argued that the<br />\nshuttles often do not stop when<br />\nthe students are not outside. The<br />\ndrivers attributed this tendency to<br />\nthe demands of the passengers for<br />\nrapid transportation.

Blitz<br />\nhas been forced to go up to the<br />\nroof on repeated occasions to ask<br />\nstudents to leave. Blitz said that<br />\nthe roof is a very dangerous place<br />\nto just \"hang out.\" There are<br />\nnumerous soft spots in the roof<br />\nthrough which a person can easily<br />\nfall.<br />\nAlso, the wall at the edge of<br />\nthe roof is very low, and structures on the roof provide places<br />\nbehind which an attacker can<br />\nhide.<br />\nAccording to fire codes, the<br />\ndoor to the roof should be easily<br />\naccessible to residents. Most<br />\nmodern access doors have alarms<br />\nthat go off when the door is opened. However, in McCoy the door<br />\nis old and has no fire alarm that<br />\nsounds properly.

Lombardi<br />\nclaimed that one of the goals of<br />\nHopkins is to \"make sure our<br />\nundergrads get some kind of interaction with the stuff of research<br />\n...that's what this university does<br />\nbetter than any other university in<br />\nthe world.\" In terms of teaching,<br />\nhowever,\"we can't quite figure<br />\nout how to get it together.\"<br />\n<br />\nLombardi went on to recall the<br />\nimpressions he got from alumni<br />\nwho remember their years at<br />\nHopkins as their 'Golden Days.'<br />\nIn addition, he wondered if<br />\n\"there was something wrong<br />\nwith the students who come to<br />\nJohns Hopkins; that they are<br />\ndumb, they can't read U.S. News<br />\nand World Report and don't know<br />\nwhat kind of place this is???\"<br />\nLombardi argued that, in fact,<br />\nundergraduates do know what<br />\ngoes on, and if they choose not<br />\nto come to Hopkins, \"they go to<br />\nanother institution exactly like it.<br />\nThey won't go to a small college<br />\nwithout a big name and the big<br />\nname comes from the research<br />\nthat we demand.\"<br />\nIn his closing remarks, Sykes<br />\nremarked that he wasn't ready to,<br />\n\"jump on the bandwagon of the<br />\nsuccess of American higher<br />\n<br />\neducation.\" He expressed concern about college graduates who<br />\nhad never taken a course in<br />\nhistory, philosophy, or literature<br />\nand were scientifically illiterate.<br />\nLombardi concluded that if there<br />\nwas one fault that required attention, it was undoubtedly in the<br />\ncontent and structure of the curriculum for undergraduates.

Cardin<br />\nspoke about current issues facing<br />\nthe Democratic Party, particularly the Reagan Administration's<br />\nCatastrophic Health Care Act.<br />\nCardin complained about many<br />\nof the problems currently facing<br />\nthe government. He said that the<br />\nbudget deficit created by<br />\nReagan's policies led to two other<br />\nequally disastrous deficits: the<br />\ntrade deficit, which keeps<br />\nAmerica uncompetitive in the<br />\nworld economy, and the social<br />\ndeficit, which leaves the government internally weak and impotent in dealing with social problems such as health care.<br />\nTurning to the health care problem, Cardin opined that<br />\nMedicare was not as comprehen-<br />\n<br />\nsive in providing care as the programs in other Western nations.<br />\nHe explained that one in six<br />\nAmericans fail to receive any sort<br />\nof health insurance, and that<br />\ndespite the fact that America<br />\nspends more money per capita<br />\nthan any other country, some 36<br />\nmillion working people have no<br />\nform of health coverage and some<br />\n57 percent of the elderly do not<br />\nqualify for full Medicare benefits.<br />\nCardin said that even a \"rightwing\" member of the Canadian<br />\nparliament was amazed at the lack<br />\nof comprehensive health care in<br />\nthis country, since such care is<br />\nconsidered \"basic decency\" in<br />\nCanada. He said that Americans<br />\ncould learn from the socialized<br />\nhealth care systems of West Germany, Britain, and the Scandinavian countries, and build an<br />\nAmerican health system that promotes competition but also meets<br />\npeople's needs.<br />\nHe noted that the Catastrophic<br />\nHealth Care Act of 1981 was<br />\n<br />\none of the few bills ever passed<br />\nin Congress for which the constituency affected was forced to<br />\nfund in its entirety. Cardin said<br />\nthat \"Reagan expected the elderly<br />\nto pay for 100 percent of their<br />\nhealth care, in effect adding a 15<br />\npercent surtax to their<br />\ndiminishing Social Security.\" He<br />\ndismissed this as \"classic<br />\nReaganism,\" and indicated that<br />\nthe Act failed to deal with many<br />\nissues involving indigency, nursing and unskilled care, and longterm medical stays.<br />\nFocusing on priorities for the<br />\nDemocratic Party, Cardin felt<br />\nthat since Democrats encompass<br />\nall sides\u2014liberal, conservative,<br />\nand moderate\u2014and that the health<br />\ncare question was universal, it<br />\nwas a perfect issue for Democrats<br />\nto tackle. He said that Democrats<br />\nhad to \"face up\" to dealing with<br />\nthe budget deficit by cutting unnecessary spending and raising<br />\ntaxes.<br />\n<br />\n\fNEWS-LETTER/5<br />\n<br />\n\u2022<br />\n<br />\nEl<br />\n<br />\nCrossword<br />\n<br />\n5F1..RISCEAEL.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: I thank<br />\neverybody.<br />\nI think that in general, I'm pretty ungrateful, in fact, \"thank\" is<br />\na word I've always had trouble<br />\nwith. To me it's always sounded<br />\nlike the past tense of \"think.\"<br />\nYou know, today I think, yesterday I thank, I now have thunk for<br />\ntwo days.<br />\nOr maybe I've thought it would<br />\nbe better as a sound effect.<br />\nSomething like a plate whistling<br />\nthrough the air then clanking<br />\nagainst some silverware.<br />\nThe usage of the word is just<br />\nas incomprehensible, at least to<br />\nme. \"Thank you\" was one of the<br />\nanswers to that question adults<br />\nalways asked,\"Now what do you<br />\nsay?\" (It was right up there with<br />\n\"I'm sorry\" and \"Please.\") This<br />\nsegment of rearing frequently<br />\ncoincided with that period in middle school in which we were<br />\nreminded not to refer to people<br />\nwe didn't know as \"Hey you.\"<br />\nIn my case, it coincided with<br />\nthat period of my education when<br />\nI was learning to diagram<br />\nsentences. \"Thank you\" was one<br />\nof those trick sentences that<br />\nteachers loved to throw at<br />\nstudents to see how deeply they<br />\nunderstood grammar. Apparently the sentence \"Thank you\"<br />\n(and yes, it is a complete<br />\nsentence) has what is known as<br />\nan implied subject, the subject of<br />\ncourse being the speaker, or the<br />\none who is thanking, for he or she<br />\nis the one performing the action.<br />\nWhat this means in terms of<br />\ndiagramming is that one must<br />\ndraw the little tree, put the verb<br />\nwhere it goes, separate the<br />\n\"Thank\" and \"you\" by a line,<br />\nand put the letter \"I\" on the left<br />\nin parentheses. In this way, one<br />\nshows that there is in fact a person thanking, but keeps it<br />\nseparated from the sentence to<br />\nwhich it refers (a real balk in the<br />\nuse of parentheses, if you ask me,<br />\nsince the whole point in using<br />\n<br />\nthem is to add stuff to sentences,<br />\nand in using them you can't help<br />\nbut draw attention to whatever's<br />\nin them). At least, this is what my<br />\nteachers told me.<br />\nBut why shouldn't the speaker<br />\nrefer to himself'? Why shouldn't<br />\nyou say, \"I thank you?\"<br />\n\"That would be conceited.<br />\n'Thank you' is a way of showing<br />\ncourtesy to someone. You humble yourself by referring to him<br />\nor her, and not to yourself.\"<br />\nThat's courtesy? Then why<br />\ndon't we also have to use the person's name? After all, aren't you<br />\nalways telling us not to call people, \"Hey you?\"<br />\n\"Yes, well, perhaps you have<br />\nyour own ideas on courtesy.<br />\nCharles, will you do the next<br />\nsentence for us at the<br />\nblackboard?\"<br />\nBut, what about\u2014<br />\n\"Thank you, Christopher.\"<br />\nIt was through incidents such<br />\nas this one that I earned my<br />\nreputation among my fifth, sixth,<br />\nseventh, and eighth grade<br />\nteachers as a \"flippant, ungrateful<br />\nyoung man.\" Oddly enough, this<br />\nwas also around the time I started<br />\nmaking friends (I didn't really<br />\nhave any up until sixth grade,<br />\nbecause I was so conceited\u2014<br />\nalways Teacher's Pet, always<br />\ntalking about my grades).<br />\nBut, anyway, I really didn't<br />\nunderstand \"Thank you.\" It<br />\nbecame something very difficult<br />\nfor me to say, even up till now,<br />\neven just in passing. I'm always<br />\naware that I'm saying it, and it<br />\nalways sounds goofy coming out.<br />\nBut for the vast majority of people, \"Thank you\" has become<br />\njust another phrase, like \"How're<br />\nyou?\" (a question I always apply a good bit of thought to when<br />\nasked, ifjust to catch the inquirer<br />\noff guard), or \"What's new?\"<br />\nIt's like when you go home for<br />\nthe holidays, and all of your<br />\nfriends and your parents' friends<br />\nSee PUNCHLINE, 7<br />\n<br />\nBy agreeing to debate academic iconoclast Charles Sykes<br />\nat Tuesday's MSE Symposium lecture, Johns Hopkins Provost John Lombardi was making a significant gesture.<br />\nSince the publication of Sykes' scathing critique of higher<br />\neducation, Profscam, no university administrator has been<br />\nwilling to appear publicly with Sykes, let alone engage in<br />\ndebate. Tuesday's forum was also notable for the fact that<br />\nboth of the speakers were familiar with some of our university's peculiarities, something which was notably absent<br />\nin both Moffat and Cavazos' addresses. Gestures notwithstanding, Lombardi's substantive responses to Sykes'<br />\ncharges of undergraduate orphanage were few and far<br />\nbetween.<br />\nLombardi tacitly acknowledged that there was some difficulty at Hopkins, as well as at other universities, with<br />\nforeign TAs who have little command of English. But<br />\nrather than address this touchy issue directly, Lombardi<br />\nadeptly skidded around it, suggesting that by teaching<br />\nundergraduates, graduate students will therefore become<br />\nbetter teachers at the professorial level. His intrinsic contradiction here would be comic were it not so cynical; professors in some cases aren't in the classroom in the first<br />\nplace, which is why the grads are teaching. How current<br />\ngraduate students can be expected to gravitate towards the<br />\nclassroom was never made clear.<br />\nEqually disturbing was Lombardi's failure to defend<br />\nHopkins against charges that it was the prototypical example of a research university gone mad. The academic<br />\nplight of undergraduates at Hopkins, while not especially<br />\nencouraging at many levels, particularly in the sciences,<br />\nis in some ways superior to that at many other \"elite\"<br />\nschools. At Hopkins, at any rate, one can safely say that<br />\nupperclassmen who haven't had any contact with professors while at the University probably have only<br />\nthemselves to blame. At the very least it would have been<br />\nencouraging to hear some comments from such a highlevel administrator which indicated a good understanding<br />\nof what it's like to be a Hopkins undergrad. Sykes'<br />\nstereotypes aside, Hopkins is not all TAs and cold<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nThis is especially true of many of the liberal arts at<br />\nHopkins, where it is not at all unusual for a graduating<br />\nsenior to have had nearly no TAs since freshman year introductory classes, and to have working relationships with<br />\nseveral professors thanks to small upper-level courses.<br />\nLombardi, of all people, should be aware of this situation;<br />\nan administrator and a professor, he teaches an<br />\nundergraduate class in the department of history with only<br />\ntwo students.<br />\nBy not energetically defending our arts and sciences<br />\nother than through hyperbolic references to a supposedly<br />\nstellar reputation, Lombardi did undergraduates no service. An understanding that it is not possible to generalize<br />\nabout undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins has been<br />\nlacking in national criticism of our university. Lombardi<br />\n<br />\nshould have contributed to a better understanding of the<br />\ntrue dynamics of the school, particularly with a man as<br />\ninfluential as Sykes as his audience, but ultimately he only kowtowed to facile stereotypes. If Hopkins is to lead<br />\nother universities towards better undergraduate teaching,<br />\nas some in the audience suggested we should, then the first<br />\nstep should be honest self-appraisal. Such honesty did not<br />\nabound on Tuesday evening.<br />\n<br />\nAttending to details<br />\nThroughout this year, the HOP has established trends<br />\nthat have helped to draw together the Hopkins community. Along with the return of Friday afternoon Hoppy<br />\nHours, the HOP has started new events such as the Monday Night Football Sports Extravaganza in the Rat.<br />\nThe HOP has now begun to plan for the installation of<br />\nan Entertainment Council. The purpose of the new council is to be twofold: to bring popular entertainment to an<br />\napparently uneventful campus, and second, to raise money<br />\nfor increased programming.<br />\nThe Hopkins student body, scattered throughout various<br />\nBaltimore zip codes, does need a compelling reason to<br />\nreturn to campus once they've trekked to their off-campus<br />\napartment or row house for the evening. By drawing quality performers regularly to Homewood, students will<br />\narguably have better opportunities to come together and<br />\nbuild a stronger sense of community. Money generated<br />\nfrom proceeds could go towards providing stronger<br />\nprogramming.<br />\nThe Entertainment Council is already looking forward<br />\nto Homecoming Weekend in April, when a big shin-dig<br />\nis planned in the U parking lot.<br />\nCouncil, however, should not limit itself to only long<br />\nrange, top-name billings. A variety of regular events are<br />\ncurrently held that Council should do more to promote.<br />\nFor example, local bands play most Wednesday nights at<br />\nChester's Place. Unfortunately, a majority of students<br />\naren't aware that Chester's is on-campus, located- on the<br />\nsecond floor of Levering Hall. And it's free. The Grad<br />\nClub is another spot (virtually on-campus) that has hosted<br />\nlocal performers for years. Council would do well to raise<br />\nawareness and an interest in such weekly events for a student body that apparently craves regular entertainment.<br />\nBy promoting entertainment already available on campus as well as long-range planning, Council could make<br />\ngreat strides towards immediately improving life at<br />\nHopkins. Council should encourage grass-roots campus<br />\ninitiatives rather than merely emphasize mega-budget extravaganzas.<br />\n<br />\nLetters<br />\nLombardi I<br />\nDr. Lombardi:<br />\nI was not able to ask this question Tuesday night, but I hope<br />\nthat you will still address it. On<br />\nTuesday, you made a statement<br />\nto the effect that if undergraduate<br />\neducation was as bad as the<br />\nreports make out, the country's<br />\nbest high school seniors would<br />\nnot still be eager to attend. Here,<br />\nan analogy best illustrates the<br />\npoint I wish to make. When<br />\npesticides were first marketed in<br />\nthe 1950s, in no way were these<br />\nchemicals said to be toxic or<br />\nharmful to any but pest plant or<br />\nanimal species. Being uninformed, the American people naively<br />\nbelieved they were not. Only<br />\nafter human and environmental<br />\ncosts were incurred were the<br />\nharmful effects of these chemicals<br />\nrecognized. Pesticide companies<br />\nare now required to disclose the<br />\ndangers as well as the benefits of<br />\ntheir products, to the consumer's<br />\nadvantage. I do not like the<br />\nanalogy of the modern university with a business any more than<br />\nMr. Sykes did; however, I am<br />\ntired of being a ;wive American<br />\nconsumer. When advertising<br />\nthemselves to uninformed high<br />\nschool seniors, the obvious thing<br />\nfor schools like Hopkins to do is<br />\ngloss over the pitfalls of<br />\nundergraduate education here<br />\n(faculty who ignore teaching,<br />\nTAs with no English skills, huge<br />\nclasses at the 300 level, etc.). Instead, they emphasize a largely<br />\ntheoretical 7:1 student-faculty<br />\nratio, reputation based on<br />\nresearch, and the value of the<br />\ndegree. We are paying for a product, Dr. Lombardi: regretfully,<br />\n<br />\nnot an education, but a degree. If<br />\nit were a car or a pesticide that<br />\nwe were purchasing, any consumer advocate would say that,<br />\nas uninformed potential buyers,<br />\nwe deserved all the facts before<br />\nwe invested time and money.<br />\nDon't you? Whi!.! a mediocre<br />\neducation will not cause death,<br />\nthe costs to the consumer, both<br />\nfinancial and intellectual, are just<br />\nas high.<br />\nElisabeth Inman<br />\n<br />\nLombardi II<br />\nTo the editors:<br />\nThe 1989 Milton Eisenhower<br />\n<br />\nSymposium deals directly with an<br />\nissue that should concern all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. It consists of a series of<br />\nlectures addressing the value of<br />\nAmerican higher education today<br />\nand in the future. Student, and<br />\nspecifically undergraduate, attendance at the lectures thus far has<br />\nbeen impressive, as it should be.<br />\nUnfortunately, faculty attendance<br />\nhas been extremely disappointing. Aside from the lecture by<br />\nCharles Sykes, which many<br />\nfaculty members attended but remained silent during the questionand-answer session, low faculty<br />\nturnout has given students the<br />\nmessage that we are engaged in<br />\na losing battle.

Second, the best essays combine<br />\nmuscular structure\u2014or no apparent structure\u2014<br />\nwith a face-slapping immediacy that rivals the best<br />\nshort fiction. But third, and most important, essays<br />\nusually manage to inform readers as they entertain.<br />\nBetter still, the form allows almost limitless flexibility, far more than its long history might suggest. Nearly any subject is fair game, and length<br />\nSee ESSAYS, 10<br />\n<br />\nPublishing is a tough racket for authors and<br />\npublishers alike. The coincidence of artistic and<br />\ncommercial success is a rare occasion. The requirements of critical circles and the consuming<br />\npublic, it seems, are forever at odds. There are<br />\neditors who, in their darker moods, might even<br />\nclaim that the two are mutually exclusive.<br />\nAuthors have somewhat different concerns. For<br />\nthe multitude of young unknowns seeking to enter<br />\nthe short story market, the question is less what<br />\nshould they publish than where can they find a<br />\nmagazine or journal that will consent to publish<br />\ntheir work. For the better-known writers whose<br />\nmaterial has found greater acceptance, the material<br />\nrewards (money) improve (especially with prize<br />\ngigs like The New Yorker and Playboy) but there<br />\nare precious few who manage to eke out any sort<br />\nof living of it.<br />\nAgainst this background comes \"The Best<br />\nAmerican Short Stories 1989.\" Launched in 1915<br />\nand revitalized in 1978, \"Best American\"<br />\nmanages to fulfill the needs of both author and<br />\neditor. Presented in a smart, midline format with<br />\na different writer appointed each year to serve a<br />\neditor, the annual volume collects and reprints 20<br />\nstories from magazines and journals of all sizes.<br />\nWhile the lesser known writers lend the volume<br />\ncredibility with the critics, the guest-star editorship (which has included such commercial<br />\nheavyweights as John Updike and Anne Tyler),<br />\nand the inclusion of at least four or five \"name\"<br />\n<br />\nby Mark Mazullo<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nK<br />\n<br />\n.<br />\n4.4<br />\nNum,.<br />\n<br />\nby Mark W.

While his playing was for<br />\nthe most part elegant and controlled, it was during a major memory lapse that Schulman exhibited<br />\nhis greatest charm.<br />\nThe mishap occurred during Paganini's \"Variations on one string on a Theme from Rossini's<br />\n'Moses'.\"Written originally for violin, but equally impressive on the cello, this virtuoso piece combines scales, arpreggios, and harmonics with a<br />\nsimple melody. Schulman, obviously absorbed in<br />\nthe negotiation of Paganini's pyrotechnics, made<br />\na structural \"wrong turn\" and ended up utterly<br />\nlost.<br />\nWhile many, more fragile performers would<br />\nhave cringed at this point, Schulman preserved his<br />\nrole as master of ceremonies.

A crowd cannot be<br />\ncomfortable with a nervous player; Schulman's<br />\ngood humor served to turn this awkward moment<br />\ninto a beneficial one. Ultimately, the audience<br />\nseemed to cheer Schulman the man as much as<br />\nSchulman the musician.<br />\nWith an abundance of credentials to his name,<br />\nthe thirty-year-old Schulman is a highly<br />\nmarketable musician. It is noteworthy that much<br />\n<br />\nwriters allows publisher Houghton Mifflin to rope<br />\nin the public. This, then, is an attempt to find the<br />\nintersection between commerce and art.<br />\nDoubtless, asking Margaret Atwood, author of<br />\nthe best-selling \"Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Cat's<br />\nEye,\" to be this year's guest editor seemed like<br />\na good idea. Like Tyler and Updike, Atwood's<br />\nwork has found acceptance within both popular<br />\nand critical camps. Reading her introduction,<br />\nhowever, proves the contrary. \"Reading Blind,\"<br />\nwhich is also Atwood's metaphor for her selection process, is a mawkish opening\u2014the kind of<br />\nthing you might expect from a high-school speech<br />\nclass presentation. \"Whenever I'm asked to talk<br />\nabout what constitutes a 'good' story, or what<br />\nmakes one well-written 'better' than another,\" she<br />\nconfides, \"I begin to feel very uncomfortable.\"<br />\nThis \"awkwardness,\" it turns out, is her introduction's central theme. That she chooses to put works<br />\n\"good\" and \"better\" in quotations in a book that<br />\nclaims to contain the year's finest stories bodes<br />\nill for the reader. Throughout the introduction, At-<br />\n<br />\nwood undercuts whatever force her arguments<br />\nmight exert with relentless equanimity and flatfooted witticisms. Where last year's editor, Mark<br />\nHelprin, blasted the so-called minimalist school<br />\nof fiction for failing to say anything about the life<br />\naround them, Atwood simply chides them for ignoring \"the voice of the story\" and reminding<br />\nthem that\". . . understatement can be overdone,<br />\nplainsong can get too plain.\"<br />\nGranted, the editor's assignment is difficult.<br />\nWriting an introduction to a collection of stories<br />\nwhose only connection is that they have been<br />\ndeemed the year's finest is'a challenge best met<br />\nsimply by discussing the stories themselves.

Knopf<br />\n$17.95<br />\nby Rebecca Garron<br />\nScott Bradfield's first novel requires a renunciation of all that is familiar and secure: one's<br />\nsheltered, upper middle class, well-educated and\u2014<br />\nin the case of this reader\u2014relatively sane upbringing. With the opening words of eight-year-old<br />\nnarrator Phillip Davis, we are thrust into his shifting, unsteady, and distorted world. \"The History<br />\nof Luminous Motion\" begins with Phillip and his<br />\nmother homeless and driving with no particular<br />\n<br />\ndestination. We travel with Phillip from this<br />\naimless but happy driving through a brief interlude<br />\nin which his mother settles down with a hardware<br />\nstore owner who goes by the pseudonym Pedro,<br />\nto his final rooting (which will prove his undoing) in the California Valley.<br />\nThe journey in \"The History of Luminous Motion\" is, as well, a journey into the mind of the<br />\nyoung and disturbingly precocious Phillip. During the novel's early driving scenes, he is happy, warm, and, as narrator, lyrically aware of his<br />\nphysical surroundings: Bradfield exhibits a keen<br />\neye for the details of how a city works. Phillip<br />\nseems secure when he is alone and moving with<br />\nhis mother, for whom he feels a violently Oedipal<br />\nlove. As he settles down with Pedro, life becomes<br />\n<br />\nunhappy and Phillip withdraws, feels<br />\n\"abstract\"\u2014as if he were disappearing. After an<br />\nunnamed but clearly profound act of hatred for<br />\nPedro, Phillip and his mother return to the road<br />\nand, finally, settle down once again, this time by<br />\nthemselves, at which point Phillip's mother<br />\nretreats into alcoholic oblivion.<br />\nRodney and Beatrice enter where Mother exits. Rodney is a twelve-year old psychopath with<br />\nwhom Phillip burglarizes local homes; Beatrice<br />\nis the prophetic and somewhat pretentious girl who<br />\nbefriends them.

And director<br />\nHerbert Ross, of course, has to make it all stick<br />\ntogether.<br />\nBut with skill and perhaps a little luck,<br />\neverything confidently falls into place. \"Steel<br />\nMagnolias\" is well written and sharply acted, a<br />\npoignant and funny tale of six ordinary but resilient<br />\nwomen in the present day South. Neither the acting nor the film loses its focus, even as the<br />\ncharacters undergo a range of adversities.<br />\nAs the film begins, it appears that Annelle<br />\n(Daryl Hannah) will form the center of \"Steel<br />\nMagnolias.\" She's an easily rattled wallflower,<br />\nalthough she was \"valedictorian of the hairdo<br />\nclass.\" New to town, she finds work as an assistant to Truvy (Dolly Parton), whose creed is<br />\n\"there's no such thing as natural beauty.\"<br />\n\"Steel Magnolias\" seems to focus on holidays<br />\nand celebrations, which may account for the lack<br />\nof tension between the characters. It also makes<br />\none wonder what these people do with each other<br />\nwhen there isn't a party; one rarely sees them at<br />\ntheir jobs, for example, or doing anything like<br />\ngrocery shopping.<br />\nThey do get their hair done several times; this<br />\noffers the characters their most opportune<br />\nmoments for gabbing. Director Ross keeps these<br />\nscenes especially faithful to the play, at least in<br />\nlength. At the hairdresser, everyone gets along so<br />\ndamn well that one finds it irritating. But the<br />\ncharacters have sufficient quirks and funny lines<br />\nto compensate for the lack of all-out catfights.<br />\nMost of the holidays here seem like conveniently<br />\nplaced double-whammies: the film opens on Easter<br />\nweekend, which is also the weekend of Shelby's<br />\n(Julia Roberts) wedding. The details of the<br />\npreparations are frantic and genuine: while<br />\nShelby's father Drum (Tom Skeritt) blasts birds<br />\nout of the trees, her mother M'Lynn (Sally Field)<br />\ntries to prevent her sons from decorating the wedding car with inflated condoms.<br />\nAlthough the conflict which later develops betSee MOVIES, 12<br />\n<br />\n\f10/NOVEMBER 17, 1989<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\n0<br />\n<br />\nsurprise no one; it's simply how the publishing<br />\nracket works. In the end, \"The Best American<br />\nShort Stories 1989\" is no more than the sum of<br />\nits parts: commerce, compromise, credibility, and<br />\ncraft.

At worst,<br />\nthe stories are well-crafted trifles. Most, however,<br />\nare memorable in some small, but worthwhile<br />\nmanner. A very few are actually quite excellent.<br />\nBharati Mukherjee's \"The Management of<br />\nGrief\" belongs to this latter group. Winner of the<br />\n1989 National Book Critics Circle award for fiction and author of seven novels, Mukherjee<br />\ndemonstrates none of the academic stiffness present in the prose of a number of the other authors<br />\nhere. The first-person narrative voice she develops<br />\nin \"The Management of Grief\" is untrained and<br />\nexpressive. With it, she tells the story of an Indian housewife whose family is killed when their<br />\nAir India jet explodes over the Irish Sea, victims<br />\nof a terrorist bomb. Refusing to mourn until all<br />\nhope is gone, the narrator wanders the coast of<br />\nIreland, waiting patiently for their bodies to be<br />\ndredged from the icy waters. They're never found,<br />\nhowever, and the narrator takes it as a sign that<br />\nthey are not truly dead. Mukherjee's writing rings<br />\nwith calm power throughout the story, making<br />\neven its mysterious conclusion undeniable.<br />\nRick DeMarinis's \"The Flowers of Boredom,\"<br />\nan eerily detached account of employment within<br />\nthe defense industry, is of equal excellence.<br />\nDeMarinis creates a frighteningly alien yet realistic<br />\nworld in his nine pages. The narrator is selfconsciously aware of both the byzantine working<br />\nof the defense industry and the metaphoric<br />\nsignificance of the military's preoccupation with<br />\nmultiple back-up systems (as an analog to man's<br />\nfear of mortality). Yet aware as the narrator is of<br />\nhis surroundings, he is helpless to prevent them<br />\nfrom affecting his behavior. His self-consciousness<br />\nis no defense against his circumstances\u2014a powerful statement on post-modern America; it's an ambivalent, menacing story that DeMarinis writes.<br />\nThe allusion made to Baudelaire's\"Les Fleurs de<br />\nMal\" is especially apt. DeMarinis' new novel,<br />\n\"The Year of the Zinc Penny,\" came out just<br />\nrecently to rave reviews. On the basis of this story,<br />\none is inclined to believe them.<br />\nAt the other end of the spectrum are such works<br />\nas Charles Baxter's wandering \"Fenstad's<br />\nMother\" and Robert Boswell's melodramatic<br />\n\"Living to Be a Hundred.\" Despite their often<br />\nlovely prose, neither story is convincing. Dale Ray<br />\nPhilips's \"What Men Love For\" fares only slightly better, though again, largely due to his elegant<br />\nprose. Most of the rest fall between these two extremes. Of note are Mark Richard's \"Strays,\"<br />\nAlice Munro's \"Meneseteung,\" and Madison<br />\nSmartt Bell's \"Customs of the Country.\"<br />\nAs a collection, the conceit underlying \"The<br />\nBest American Short Stories 1989\" is not entirely palatable. While the 20 stories here are polished, professionally rendered, and eminently<br />\nreadable, it is easy to be frustrated by the collection's failed sense of adventure. Series editor<br />\nShannon Ravenel claims to read every story<br />\npublished by the nearly 200 journals and,<br />\nmagazines listed at the back of the book. Frankly, though, it's impossible to believe she honestly considers even a fraction of that number. More<br />\nthan a few critics poisonously nickname the series<br />\n\"The Best of the New Yorker,\" and for good<br />\nreason; four stories from the magazine were included in this year's edition, with an additional<br />\ntwelve listed in the appendix, \"100 Other<br />\nDistinguished Stories.\" With Harper's, Esquire,<br />\nand Atlantic, that accounts for nearly half of the<br />\ncollection.

(For illustration, compare<br />\nJohn Milton's mammoth, 17th-century<br />\n\"Areopagitica\" with Raymond Carver's recent<br />\n\"Fires,\" for example.) But traditions and structural freedoms aside, what makes an essay any<br />\ndifferent from the 30,000-word chunks of reportage that appear in The New Yorker? Or the less<br />\nsubstantial, 2,000-word clumps that Newsweek<br />\nkneads into a cover story each week?<br />\nWhen in doubt, look to the pages: Essays today, of which \"The Best American Essays 1989\"<br />\ncontains a fairly representative sampling, are as<br />\ndizzyingly diverse as contemporary fiction, and<br />\ngenerally less pretentious. They juggle their facts<br />\nmore adroitly\u2014and less conspicuously\u2014than the<br />\naverage news story, and they usually harbor crafty<br />\nintentions, aiming to pierce the reader's mind and<br />\nemotions with a single, seemingly casual shot.<br />\nOn this level, \"The Best American Essays<br />\n1989\" is a consistent success: of the twenty-one<br />\npieces collected here, a good sixteen are exceptional, or close. Novelist Julian Barnes contributes<br />\n\"Playing Chess with Arthur Koestler,\" which is<br />\nabout exactly that, although the matches he<br />\ndescribes are far from conventional in any sense.<br />\nOn the 1988 presidential election trail, Joan Didion provides insights and sharp reporting on the<br />\nsound-bite and photo-op events that were \"not<br />\nmerely meaningless but deliberately so . . . .\"<br />\nRobert Stone, at the 1988 Republican convention<br />\nin New Orleans, reflects warily on that city, its<br />\nchanging faces, and the ways in which politics and<br />\ncircumstance have altered the city's character over<br />\nthe years.

But be warned: merely to<br />\nstate the subjects of these essays conveys<br />\npathetically little of their presence on the page.<br />\nRichard Ford recalls the slice of his childhood<br />\nspent in a hotel managed by his grandfather, and<br />\nrenders the period in clean prose that evokes a<br />\ncrystalline sense of his feelings at the time. His<br />\nessay, \"Accomodations,\" isn't strictly about that<br />\nstay, and it doesn't necessarily paint a vivid<br />\nphysica! portrait of the hotel, but its pure energy<br />\nis at times exhilarating.<br />\n<br />\nThe honesty of some of the writers here can both<br />\ndisarm and be disarming. Judy Ruiz begins<br />\n\"Oranges and Sweet Sister Boy\" with a phone<br />\ncall from her brother\u2014\"he's calling to say that<br />\nhe is now my sister\"\u2014and goes on to investigate<br />\nsome of the odd fragments of her and her erstwhile<br />\nbrother's sexual pasts. In Edward Hoagland's astounding \"Heaven and Nature,\" perhaps the best<br />\nessay in the collection, the author recalls the circumstances surrounding the suicides of certain<br />\nfriends and acquaintances and reveals his own<br />\nsporadic fear that he, too, might take his own life.<br />\n\"It is profoundly startling,\" he writes, \"not to<br />\ntrust oneself after decades of doing so.\"<br />\nHoagland's essay, like perhaps half a dozen<br />\nothers in this collection, casually seizes a reader's<br />\n<br />\nThe JHU Barnstormers present:<br />\n<br />\nly vaguely see the opaqueness of the roof.

I was driving home from the<br />\nrig, having finished logging, going back out on<br />\nthe board road, which had flooded during the<br />\nnight: about half a foot of water stood above the<br />\nboards. I had to go slowly and guess where the<br />\nroad was and wasn't by looking at the lane cut<br />\nthrough the woods, and hoping the boards stayed<br />\nbeneath me. A few of them were floating loose,<br />\npointing in all directions. What I didn't know was<br />\nthat there was a very deep drainage ditch on either<br />\nside of the board road.<br />\nIt all looked the same with six inches of water<br />\ncovering it: like a broad, shallow, muddy swamp.<br />\nI drove slowly. I got off the board road and didn't<br />\nknow it. I was creeping along, water lapping just<br />\nbelow the headlights. Suddenly there was a downelevator feeling and brown water came rushing<br />\nup over the hood and onto my windshield. I didn't<br />\neven turn the ignition off; I scrambled out through<br />\nthe window and swam two strokes back to the<br />\nboard road while the muddy waters closed in<br />\naround the roof of my\u2014Mr. H.'s\u2014car.

Frank Conroy's \"Think<br />\nAbout It\" weaves three very well-written anecdotes of adolescence toward a sloppy, unsatisfying conclusion; Leonard Kriegel's tale of \"learning to fall\" is frequently precious and repetitive;<br />\nand Stanley Elkin's account of his brief stint with<br />\na freelance dance troupe is self-indulgent and<br />\nsomewhat tiresome.<br />\nMuch of the credit (or blame) for the selections<br />\nshould go to editor Geoffrey Wolff. who chose<br />\nthe twenty-one pieces here from \"roughly 300\"<br />\npresented to him by series editor Robert Atwan.<br />\nAtwan apparently reads all of the essays sent to<br />\nhim each year by hundreds of national and local<br />\nperiodicals, winnows out the \"best\" of them, and<br />\nforwards them to each year's guest editor, a role<br />\nfilled in the past by Annie Dillard, Gay Talese,<br />\nand Elizabeth Hardwick. So Wolff doesn't deserve<br />\nall of the credit for good taste here; he certainly<br />\ndeserves no thanks for his twenty-five-page introduction, which sputters along tirelessly about<br />\nhis education, early jobs, and philosophies of life.<br />\nThe piece casts little insight on the collection<br />\nitself\u2014though Wolff clearly read the essays with<br />\nmore lucidity than he wrote the introduction\u2014<br />\nand seems hollow in contrast to Atwan's compact,<br />\n<br />\nHullabaloo<br />\n<br />\nI<br />\n<br />\nFrom the book \"Oil Notes\" by Rick Bass, published by Houghton Mifflin/Seymour Lawrence,<br />\nBoston.

Like most of<br />\nthose in the genre, the cartoon<br />\ncharacters in \"The Little Mermaid\" seem derivative, modeled<br />\nafter people we actually know to<br />\nexist. We end up comparing them<br />\nto real actors, not using them as<br />\npoints of reference as children<br />\nlikely would.<br />\nThis is only the fault of \"The<br />\nLittle Mermaid\" because the cartoon is so well-crafted.

As she puts it,<br />\nshe's \"only been in a bad mood<br />\nfor the last forty years.\" Of the<br />\nactresses, Field and Maclaine<br />\nstand out as superior, and Parton's performance is surprisingly subdued and effective.

Five years<br />\nlater, the doctors were asking him<br />\nwhy he didn't die.<br />\nThe real issue is changing<br />\nyourself. You may hate your job,<br />\nbut it takes something like cancer<br />\nto make you not go. Too many<br />\n<br />\npeople take life for granted; noticing your mortality will give you<br />\nfreedom, he says. Set out to live<br />\nuntil you die. As one cancer patient put it, \"I started to live for<br />\nthe moment and life became a<br />\nseries of moments.\" You don't<br />\ndo it to not die, but to enjoy. Also<br />\nwhen you take charge of living,<br />\ndying is easier; modern medicine<br />\ndoesn't help deal with that. He<br />\nsays to do little things like taking<br />\n\"healing intervals\" during the<br />\nday and listen to music, take a<br />\nwalk, look at flowers, whatever<br />\nit takes to let you stop and not let<br />\nlife pass you by. \"Make every<br />\nday precious,\" Bernie repeatedly stressed. Consider if you were<br />\nin an accident and had time before<br />\nyou died to think about, all the<br />\nthings in life that you had been<br />\ntoo scared to try and all that you<br />\nhad put up with. Why havent't<br />\nyou? It's a good question.<br />\nBernie also stressed the importance of sharing. \"Groups are<br />\ngood because they are safe.\" In<br />\na study conducted by a<br />\npsychiatrist at Stanford University, 86 women with breast<br />\ncancer were divided into two<br />\ngroups. Group 1 received the<br />\nstandard medical treatment,<br />\nchemotherapy, radiation treatment, etc., and Group 2 received the same treatment plus weekly group therapy sessions where<br />\neveryone could vent her emotions<br />\nand offer mutual support. Group<br />\nl averaged 18.9 months without<br />\nrecurrence, but Group 2 averaged 36.6 months without<br />\nrecurrence.<br />\nMany projects have come out<br />\nof group theory, where honesty<br />\nand expressing yourself are emphasized. One such project was<br />\n<br />\nhaving half of one group during<br />\nthe course of the day stop and<br />\ncheck their feelings every hour,<br />\nand keep a journal of their feelings. The immune systems of<br />\nthose who kept journals of their<br />\nfeelings were more active than<br />\nthose who didn't express their<br />\nfeelings in writing.<br />\nHolistic medicine, as Siegel's<br />\nideas are called, is nothing new.<br />\nPlato himself cited the importance<br />\nof treating the whose patient, not<br />\njust the disease. Hippocrates also<br />\ntaught healers the importance of<br />\nnot doing anything that would interfere with the bod,y's natural<br />\nhealing process whether it be<br />\nmental or physical. In the<br />\nliterature about holistic medicine<br />\nthat the National Cancer Institute<br />\ngives to its patients, it says that,<br />\n\"health professionals are realizing that health depends on a<br />\ndelicate interaction of organic,<br />\npsychological, social, and<br />\ncultural forces, and that for healing to be effective it must consider all these areas.\"<br />\nBernie, however, does not<br />\n<br />\nwork without criticsm. His<br />\ngreatest problem it seems, is to<br />\nnot be cast with groups such as<br />\nthe Iridologists, who diagnose patients by detailed examination of<br />\nthe iris, and Polarity practitioners, who heal by pressure<br />\npoint message. It is true, though,<br />\nthat almost everything has been<br />\nhailed at one point or another as<br />\na cure or prevention of cancer, including extremely questionable<br />\npractices such as coffee enemas!<br />\nBernie says that he is not among<br />\nthese and that it must be<br />\nunderstood that holistic medicine<br />\nis merely an alternative treatment.<br />\nProven medical therapy is part of<br />\ntreatment, to be sure, but the patient must be treated as a whole.<br />\n\"Don't be afraid to give and<br />\naccept unconditional love,\" said<br />\nBernie. The central theme is to<br />\nimprove the quality of your life.<br />\nSome people ask,\"Why does this<br />\nhappen to me?\" Well, the truth<br />\nis, if you're alive, things are going to happen.

For the<br />\nsecond consecutive year the Jays<br />\navoided a winless campaign by<br />\ntopping the Terrors in the finale.<br />\nIt was a long, frustrating year<br />\nfor the Jays. \"I'm proud of our<br />\nguys for hanging in so long this<br />\nseason,\" said Pfeifer. \"It was as<br />\nthough this game was scripted for<br />\nus.\"<br />\nThe Jay offense gained 463<br />\nyards, 309 rushing, and 154 passing. Achieving 29 first downs,<br />\nthe Jays broke the school record<br />\nof 26, set in 1980.<br />\nOn the ground, Eric Mont carried the ball 19 times for 103<br />\nyards, and John Guglielmo did an<br />\nimpressive job of scrambling, as<br />\nhe gathered 125 yards. In the air,<br />\nhe was equally effective,connecting on 12 of 17 passes for 154<br />\nyards and a touchdown.<br />\nBrandon Rosser helped his<br />\nquarterback by catching 10 passes<br />\nfor 114 yards. Rosser was 3<br />\nreceptions short of tying the<br />\nHopkins single-game record.<br />\n\"John was phenomenal,\" said<br />\nsenior center Fred Conroy. \"He<br />\nplayed the best game any quarterback at Hopkins has had in my<br />\nfour years. He matured so much<br />\nthis season.\"<br />\nThe defense forced the Terrors<br />\nto punt on their first series. The<br />\nTerrors had the ball on the Jays'<br />\n20-yard line, but 2 quick losses<br />\n<br />\nput them on the 33, where they<br />\npunted on fourth down.<br />\nJohn Darre, who has been the<br />\nJays' top return man, brought the<br />\nball 20 yards to the Jays' 30. Six<br />\nplays later, the team had the ball<br />\non the 35-yard line of Western<br />\nMaryland, where, on fourth-andone, Guglielmo connected to<br />\nMike Hallenback for a<br />\ntouchdown. Darre's PAT put<br />\nHopkins up 7-0.<br />\nEarly in the second quarter, the<br />\nJays had a first-and-goal situation<br />\nbut got nothing as Guglielmo was<br />\nintercepted for a touchback.<br />\nThe Terrors then went 80 yards<br />\non three plays to tie the score.<br />\nThe only other score of the half<br />\ncame on Darre's 31-yard field<br />\ngoal into the wind. To get in<br />\nDarre's range, the Jays moved<br />\nthe ball 55 yards on four plays in<br />\n30 seconds as Guglielmo connected to Rosser for 3 consecutive first downs. On what<br />\nshould have been the last play of<br />\nthe half, Guglielmo threw an incomplete into the end zone.<br />\nHowever, a deadball foul against<br />\nWestern Maryland set up the field<br />\ngoal attempt.<br />\nEarlier in the quarter, the officials nullified what would have<br />\nbeen a 47-yard touchdown pass<br />\nto Chris Ogeneski. On the play,<br />\nGuglielmo had been flushed out<br />\nof the pocket and had thrown past<br />\nthe line of scrimmage.<br />\nThe field goal raised the team's<br />\nspirit even more. \"Once the<br />\ngame started, we knew that we<br />\nwere going to beat them really<br />\nbad,\" said captain Steve Davis.<br />\n\"They were not as good as they<br />\n<br />\nwere supposed to be.\"<br />\nThe Terrors were not terrible,<br />\nbut seemed out of sync, as they<br />\npassed much more typically.<br />\nNormally, Eric Frees carries the<br />\nball 40 to 50 times a game and<br />\nearns more than 100 yards.

Eight plays<br />\nlater, Mont sprinted 16 yards into the end zone on a sweep. \"The<br />\noffensive line did a heck of a<br />\njob,\" said Mont. \"The holes they<br />\nopened up were the biggest I've<br />\never seen.

This year,<br />\nthe team will be asked to advance<br />\nit. The 1988-89 Blue Jays exceeded expectations by compiling a<br />\n17-10 record, and advancing to<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nSouthern Division finals, where<br />\nnationally-ranked Franklin &<br />\nMarshall topped the Jays by five.<br />\nFor 1989-90, head coach Bill<br />\nNelson will have to deal with the<br />\nloss to graduation of MACSoutheast Most Valuable Player<br />\nMike Latimore and starter Jedan<br />\nPhillips. Latimore and Phillips<br />\nwere the team's top rebounders<br />\nand two of its three leading<br />\nscorers. The pair contributed an<br />\naverage of 11 rebounds and more<br />\nthan 26 points per game.<br />\nThe remainder of the team has<br />\nbeen kept virtually intact. Nine<br />\nplayers who saw significant time<br />\nlast season are returning, including 6'8\" center Joel Siepierski, who missed the last five<br />\ngames of last season due to illness.<br />\nNelson points to the team's better overall quickness, which<br />\nshould bolster the defense, and<br />\nadded experience gained from<br />\nlast year's playoff games as factors which could improve the<br />\nteam's performance as a whole.<br />\nRebounding, however, will be \"a<br />\nmajor concern\" of Nelson's<br />\nbecause of the loss of Latimore<br />\nand Phillips. Nelson hopes his<br />\nteam can compensate for limited<br />\nheight with increased intensity,determination, and quickness.<br />\nThe Jays will still feature the<br />\ntough man-to-man defense and<br />\nfamiliar \"motion\" and \"power\"<br />\noffenses that are the trademarks<br />\nof coach Nelson. As a smaller<br />\nteam, Hopkins might have a more<br />\ndifficult time scoring inside, but<br />\nNelson won't rely on outside<br />\nshooting alone.<br />\n\"We have to go inside first to<br />\nset up our perimeter game; otherwise people will key on our outside shooters,\" he said. Siepierski, who had orthroscopic knee<br />\nsurgery four weeks ago, might be<br />\nthe one to shoulder that burden.<br />\n\"The leg is pretty much heal-<br />\n<br />\nDavid Eikenberg<br />\n5'10\"<br />\nJr<br />\nG<br />\n<br />\nJr<br />\n<br />\ned, and I should be at full strength<br />\nby the end of winter break,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"As long as we can keep<br />\na good inside game, we have the<br />\npotential to improve. We have a<br />\ntough schedule,\" said Nelson. He<br />\nconceded that he might use more<br />\nof the motion offense because the<br />\nteam is generally better suited to<br />\nit.<br />\nWhen he does go to the outside<br />\ngame he will look to shooting<br />\nguard Andy Enfield to lead the<br />\nway. \"Andy's one of the premier<br />\nreturning players in Division<br />\nIII,\" Nelson said. Enfield led<br />\nHopkins in scoring last year with<br />\na 16.4 average. He also finished<br />\nsecond in the country in free<br />\nthrow percentage (91.5 percent)<br />\nand shot 50 percent from threepoint range.<br />\nPoint guard could be a key<br />\nposition for the Blue Jays this<br />\nyear because David Strong may<br />\nmiss the entire season with a back<br />\ninjury. That will put added<br />\npressure on David Eikenberg,<br />\nwho developed a reputation for<br />\ncanning clutch free throws down<br />\nthe stretch at the end of last<br />\nseason. Strong and Eikenberg had<br />\nsplit the point guard duties last<br />\nseason.<br />\nOther returning players include<br />\nsenior Kevin Roller and<br />\nsophomores Jay Gangemi, Mark<br />\nWest, and Evan Jones, who all<br />\nmade positive contributions last<br />\nyear and should see even more<br />\nplaying time this year. Gangemi<br />\nis expected to assume more of the<br />\nscoring load, and Roller and West<br />\nwill have to play some back-up<br />\npoint guard due to Strong's<br />\nabsence.<br />\nForwards Bill Zahn and Eric<br />\n<br />\nHastings also return. Hulking forward Joe Shiber decided to take<br />\nthe year off to concentrate on<br />\nacademics and housemaster<br />\nresponsibilities.<br />\nDepth will again be a Hopkins<br />\nattribute. \"Last year one of the<br />\nmain reasons we were successful<br />\nwas that we had fresh people in<br />\nthe game quite a bit,\" Nelson<br />\nsaid. Nelson said he substituted<br />\nmore last year than in any other<br />\nof his nine years as a collegiate<br />\nhead coach.<br />\n\"If there's a big discrepancy<br />\nbetween our first team and our second team, the starters will see a<br />\nlot of action. If we have parity,<br />\nwe'll continue to sub.\"<br />\nThe Jays' prize newcomer is<br />\n6'4\" forward/center Nestor<br />\nRodriguez out of New York City. Rodriguez could help Hastings<br />\nand Siepierski fill the void in the<br />\nmiddle caused by the graduation<br />\nlosses. He will have to learn the<br />\nHopkins system, especially manto-man defense. Rodriguez<br />\nplayed zone defense almost exclusively in high school. He will<br />\nnot have the luxury of breaking<br />\nin with a junior varsity team, as<br />\nNelson cancelled the program this<br />\nyear.<br />\nIf the Jays<br />\nachieve their<br />\npotential and remain injury-free,<br />\nthe Blue Jays have a good shot to<br />\nmake the Division III tournament<br />\nthis year.

The Blue<br />\nJays compiled a 12-10 record to<br />\nturn in their first-ever winning<br />\nseason.<br />\nLast year's young team, composed entirely of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, earned a third-place<br />\nfinish in the Mid-Atlantic Conference (MAC) Southwest<br />\nLeague with a 5-5 record.<br />\nHopkins defeated Lebanon Valley<br />\n(twice), Swarthmore, Dickinson<br />\nand Gettysburg, but fell twice to<br />\nFranklin & Marshall, a team<br />\nranked throughout the season in<br />\nthe top ten of NCAA Division III<br />\nwomen's basketball poll.<br />\nThe Blue Jays also put in an<br />\nimpressive performance in the<br />\ncompetitive University Athletic<br />\nAssociation (UAA) with a 4-4,<br />\nfourth-place finish. In UAA action, Hopkins defeated Chicago,<br />\nRochester, Emory, and Case<br />\nWestern Reserve.<br />\nLast season's unprecedented<br />\nsuccess seems to be serving as a<br />\nmotivator to this year's women.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have started training early this year, combining<br />\nweight and strength training with<br />\na cardiovascular program to<br />\nready themselves physically.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will be led by a<br />\nstrong core of veteran athletes.<br />\n\"This year's team is well seasoned,\" comments fourth-year coach<br />\nNancy Blank. \"They show more<br />\npoise and have a stronger<br />\npresence on the court.\" Blank has<br />\n12 years of head coaching experience behind her, and has used this experience to turn the<br />\nyoung team into winners.<br />\nLeadership should be no problem for the Jays. As<br />\nsophomores, co-captains Juliane<br />\nRolapp (DarreStown, MD) and<br />\nKristieKantowski (Ellicott City,<br />\nMD) averaged 11.1 and 10.9<br />\npoints per game, respectively.<br />\n\"Juliane was the most consistent player on the floor for us,\"<br />\npraised Blank. \"Her leadership<br />\nwas instrumental in our success.\"<br />\nAt 5'5\" (the team's shortest<br />\nplayer), Rolapp pulled down 4.2<br />\nrebounds per game while recor-<br />\n<br />\nTraci Williams<br />\nSo<br />\n5'7\"<br />\n9.2 points per game while recording 68 steals.<br />\nRounding out the talented<br />\nsophomore class is 5'11 Kelly<br />\nVan Houten (Little Falls, NJ).<br />\nVan Houten averaged almost 5<br />\npoints per game last season, as<br />\nwell as recording an average of<br />\n4.3 rebounds. The experienced<br />\ncenter/forward is a \"steady, consistent post player with outstanding offensive rebounding ability, good timing, and a strong second shot.\"<br />\nJoining the eight veterans are<br />\nfour promising recruits, all with<br />\nstrong individual talent. Blank expects \"the freshmen to contribute<br />\nto the success of this year's team.<br />\nThey all could see significant<br />\nplaying time.\"<br />\nTricia Hacker (Cedar Lake,<br />\nIN), a 5'10\" forward, comes<br />\nfrom Crown Point High School,<br />\none of the winningest women's<br />\nbasketball programs in Indiana.<br />\n\"Tricia is one of the most fundamentally sound players we've<br />\never had,\" commented Blank.<br />\n\"She is a great addition to the<br />\nteam.\"<br />\nSara Cushing (Guilford, CT),<br />\na 5'7\" guard, comes to Hopkins<br />\nfrom Guilford High School.<br />\nCushing has \"good shooting<br />\nstrength,\" according to Blank.<br />\n\"She should gain more experience as the season progresses<br />\nas an off guard.\"<br />\nSylke Knuppel (Woodbine,<br />\nMD) was last year's Baltimore<br />\nSun Player of the Year.

William<br />\nAppelbaum, assistant dean of<br />\nfinance for the medical school.<br />\nThe deficit will be incurred<br />\nmostly by the construction costs<br />\nof several new facilities, including the Asthma Center, the<br />\nAmbulatory Care Unit, the<br />\nRutland Avenue Building, and, to<br />\na lesser extent, the Huntarian<br />\nBuilding, according to University Senior Vice President Eugene<br />\nSunshine. Additional costs of<br />\noperating and maintaining these<br />\nbuildings will also contribute to<br />\nthe deficit.<br />\n\"What happens is, in a<br />\nrelatively short period of time,<br />\nyou have a very large additional<br />\ncost being incurred on the School<br />\nof Medicine by these buildings,\"<br />\nsaid Sunshine.<br />\nThe Rutland Building, for example, carries a $98 million price<br />\ntag, while the Ambulatory Care<br />\nUnit's expected cost is $140<br /><br />\nmillion. The buildings are being<br />\nfinanced through a payment<br />\nschedule not unlike a mortgage,<br />\nwith debt service payments totalling $30 million per year for the<br />\nnext four years, Sunshine said.<br />\nPart of the cost will be covered<br />\nby the profits from the school's<br />\nclinical operations, not to be confused with the Johns Hopkins<br />\nHospital, which maintains a<br />\nseparate budget. The balance, or<br />\nnet deficit, expected to accumulate between 1991 and 1993<br />\nwill be $31 million (see table).<br />\nOnce the projects are completed, the medical school will<br />\nstart to realize revenue from services that will be provided in the<br />\nnew buildings. The Ambulatory<br />\nCare Unit, for example, will<br />\nallow the school to see more patients, and the Rutland Building<br />\nwill primarily be used for contractual medical research, said<br />\nSunshine.<br />\n\"Ultimately, the revenue side<br />\nwill be enhanced to more than<br />\npay for those costs,\" Sunshine<br />\nsaid.

Dressed in professional<br />\nwork clothes with snack trays on<br />\ntheir laps, the participants listened<br />\nto Becky Strang, a counselor and<br />\nlecturer from Career and Life<br />\nTraining Program at Hopkins,<br />\nexplain what assertive behavior is<br />\nand how to implement it in personal life and professional<br />\nrelationships.<br />\nStressing that women have the<br />\ngreatest difficulty in being assertive, Strang noted that assertiveness has not been considered<br />\na communication skill in the past.<br />\nShe contended that phrases like<br />\n\"don't be angry,\" \"don't speak<br />\nuntil you're spoken to,\" and<br />\n\"don't take risks\" are all<br />\nmessages from our past home and<br />\nschool environments that stand in<br />\nthe way of developing assertiveness. Calling this session a<br />\n\"booster shot\" to start the<br />\nlisteners on the road to being<br />\nassertive, she defined assertive in<br />\nterms of handling relationships<br /><br />\nwith confidence, looking out for<br />\none's self-interest while considering others, and being able to tell<br />\nthe truth about any situation.<br />\nThe beginning of overcoming<br />\nthe barriers of feeling like you<br />\nhave \"no skill\" or \"no right to<br />\nstand up for yourself\u2014 claimed<br />\nStrang was \"feeling fundamentally pretty good about yourself.\"<br />\nShe went on to differentiate<br />\nbetwen assertive, aggressive, and<br />\nnon-assertive behavior types,<br />\nconcluding that only selfassertion puts people in a \"win<br />\nsituation\" in which they can<br />\nreach their goals.<br />\nStrang then had the entire audience stand up and introduce<br />\nthemselves to one other person<br />\npresent at the lecture.

The student<br />\ndrivers who were present at the.<br />\nmeeting suggested that the late<br />\nhours, low pay, and verbal abuse<br />\nfrom the passengers might<br />\ndiscourage possible job applicants. The Student Council<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of subsidizing the drivers' payments if<br />\nthe University will not meet their<br />\nneeds in order to guarantee the<br />\nsafety of the students.<br />\nThe Student Council expressed some concern that the<br />\nUniversity-owned apartments<br />\nwere not considered part of the<br />\ncampus and therefore were not<br />\nwithin the bounds of the shuttle<br />\nservice. Council members<br />\nasserted that students may risk<br />\ntheir own security by walking to<br />\nthe designated boarding location<br /><br />\nby the MSE Library. Major<br />\nLarkin and the student drivers<br />\nsuggested that the policy was<br />\nmerely an attempt to discourage<br />\nthe use of the shuttles as a taxi<br />\nservice. Student Council President Lou Giangiulio agreed, saying, \"The students should be<br />\nresponsible users of the vans.\"<br />\nThe Security Department has<br />\nalso implemented a temporary<br />\npolicy which prevents the<br />\noperator from issuing ETAs,<br />\nleaving the times and order of the<br />\npickups to the discretion of the<br />\ndriver.

Cardin<br />\nspoke about current issues facing<br />\nthe Democratic Party, particularly the Reagan Administration's<br />\nCatastrophic Health Care Act.<br />\nCardin complained about many<br />\nof the problems currently facing<br />\nthe government. He said that the<br />\nbudget deficit created by<br />\nReagan's policies led to two other<br />\nequally disastrous deficits: the<br />\ntrade deficit, which keeps<br />\nAmerica uncompetitive in the<br />\nworld economy, and the social<br />\ndeficit, which leaves the government internally weak and impotent in dealing with social problems such as health care.<br />\nTurning to the health care problem, Cardin opined that<br />\nMedicare was not as comprehen-<br /><br />\nsive in providing care as the programs in other Western nations.<br />\nHe explained that one in six<br />\nAmericans fail to receive any sort<br />\nof health insurance, and that<br />\ndespite the fact that America<br />\nspends more money per capita<br />\nthan any other country, some 36<br />\nmillion working people have no<br />\nform of health coverage and some<br />\n57 percent of the elderly do not<br />\nqualify for full Medicare benefits.<br />\nCardin said that even a \"rightwing\" member of the Canadian<br />\nparliament was amazed at the lack<br />\nof comprehensive health care in<br />\nthis country, since such care is<br />\nconsidered \"basic decency\" in<br />\nCanada. He said that Americans<br />\ncould learn from the socialized<br />\nhealth care systems of West Germany, Britain, and the Scandinavian countries, and build an<br />\nAmerican health system that promotes competition but also meets<br />\npeople's needs.<br />\nHe noted that the Catastrophic<br />\nHealth Care Act of 1981 was<br /><br />\none of the few bills ever passed<br />\nin Congress for which the constituency affected was forced to<br />\nfund in its entirety. Cardin said<br />\nthat \"Reagan expected the elderly<br />\nto pay for 100 percent of their<br />\nhealth care, in effect adding a 15<br />\npercent surtax to their<br />\ndiminishing Social Security.\" He<br />\ndismissed this as \"classic<br />\nReaganism,\" and indicated that<br />\nthe Act failed to deal with many<br />\nissues involving indigency, nursing and unskilled care, and longterm medical stays.<br />\nFocusing on priorities for the<br />\nDemocratic Party, Cardin felt<br />\nthat since Democrats encompass<br />\nall sides\u2014liberal, conservative,<br />\nand moderate\u2014and that the health<br />\ncare question was universal, it<br />\nwas a perfect issue for Democrats<br />\nto tackle.

McColl<br />\nThe punchline is this: I thank<br />\neverybody.<br />\nI think that in general, I'm pretty ungrateful, in fact, \"thank\" is<br />\na word I've always had trouble<br />\nwith. To me it's always sounded<br />\nlike the past tense of \"think.\"<br />\nYou know, today I think, yesterday I thank, I now have thunk for<br />\ntwo days.<br />\nOr maybe I've thought it would<br />\nbe better as a sound effect.<br />\nSomething like a plate whistling<br />\nthrough the air then clanking<br />\nagainst some silverware.<br />\nThe usage of the word is just<br />\nas incomprehensible, at least to<br />\nme. \"Thank you\" was one of the<br />\nanswers to that question adults<br />\nalways asked,\"Now what do you<br />\nsay?\" (It was right up there with<br />\n\"I'm sorry\" and \"Please.\") This<br />\nsegment of rearing frequently<br />\ncoincided with that period in middle school in which we were<br />\nreminded not to refer to people<br />\nwe didn't know as \"Hey you.\"<br />\nIn my case, it coincided with<br />\nthat period of my education when<br />\nI was learning to diagram<br />\nsentences. \"Thank you\" was one<br />\nof those trick sentences that<br />\nteachers loved to throw at<br />\nstudents to see how deeply they<br />\nunderstood grammar. Apparently the sentence \"Thank you\"<br />\n(and yes, it is a complete<br />\nsentence) has what is known as<br />\nan implied subject, the subject of<br />\ncourse being the speaker, or the<br />\none who is thanking, for he or she<br />\nis the one performing the action.<br />\nWhat this means in terms of<br />\ndiagramming is that one must<br />\ndraw the little tree, put the verb<br />\nwhere it goes, separate the<br />\n\"Thank\" and \"you\" by a line,<br />\nand put the letter \"I\" on the left<br />\nin parentheses. In this way, one<br />\nshows that there is in fact a person thanking, but keeps it<br />\nseparated from the sentence to<br />\nwhich it refers (a real balk in the<br />\nuse of parentheses, if you ask me,<br />\nsince the whole point in using<br /><br />\nthem is to add stuff to sentences,<br />\nand in using them you can't help<br />\nbut draw attention to whatever's<br />\nin them). At least, this is what my<br />\nteachers told me.<br />\nBut why shouldn't the speaker<br />\nrefer to himself'? Why shouldn't<br />\nyou say, \"I thank you?\"<br />\n\"That would be conceited.<br />\n'Thank you' is a way of showing<br />\ncourtesy to someone. You humble yourself by referring to him<br />\nor her, and not to yourself.\"<br />\nThat's courtesy? Then why<br />\ndon't we also have to use the person's name? After all, aren't you<br />\nalways telling us not to call people, \"Hey you?\"<br />\n\"Yes, well, perhaps you have<br />\nyour own ideas on courtesy.<br />\nCharles, will you do the next<br />\nsentence for us at the<br />\nblackboard?\"<br />\nBut, what about\u2014<br />\n\"Thank you, Christopher.\"<br />\nIt was through incidents such<br />\nas this one that I earned my<br />\nreputation among my fifth, sixth,<br />\nseventh, and eighth grade<br />\nteachers as a \"flippant, ungrateful<br />\nyoung man.\" Oddly enough, this<br />\nwas also around the time I started<br />\nmaking friends (I didn't really<br />\nhave any up until sixth grade,<br />\nbecause I was so conceited\u2014<br />\nalways Teacher's Pet, always<br />\ntalking about my grades).<br />\nBut, anyway, I really didn't<br />\nunderstand \"Thank you.\" It<br />\nbecame something very difficult<br />\nfor me to say, even up till now,<br />\neven just in passing. I'm always<br />\naware that I'm saying it, and it<br />\nalways sounds goofy coming out.<br />\nBut for the vast majority of people, \"Thank you\" has become<br />\njust another phrase, like \"How're<br />\nyou?\" (a question I always apply a good bit of thought to when<br />\nasked, ifjust to catch the inquirer<br />\noff guard), or \"What's new?\"<br />\nIt's like when you go home for<br />\nthe holidays, and all of your<br />\nfriends and your parents' friends<br />\nSee PUNCHLINE, 7<br /><br />\nBy agreeing to debate academic iconoclast Charles Sykes<br />\nat Tuesday's MSE Symposium lecture, Johns Hopkins Provost John Lombardi was making a significant gesture.<br />\nSince the publication of Sykes' scathing critique of higher<br />\neducation, Profscam, no university administrator has been<br />\nwilling to appear publicly with Sykes, let alone engage in<br />\ndebate. Tuesday's forum was also notable for the fact that<br />\nboth of the speakers were familiar with some of our university's peculiarities, something which was notably absent<br />\nin both Moffat and Cavazos' addresses. Gestures notwithstanding, Lombardi's substantive responses to Sykes'<br />\ncharges of undergraduate orphanage were few and far<br />\nbetween.<br />\nLombardi tacitly acknowledged that there was some difficulty at Hopkins, as well as at other universities, with<br />\nforeign TAs who have little command of English. But<br />\nrather than address this touchy issue directly, Lombardi<br />\nadeptly skidded around it, suggesting that by teaching<br />\nundergraduates, graduate students will therefore become<br />\nbetter teachers at the professorial level. His intrinsic contradiction here would be comic were it not so cynical; professors in some cases aren't in the classroom in the first<br />\nplace, which is why the grads are teaching. How current<br />\ngraduate students can be expected to gravitate towards the<br />\nclassroom was never made clear.<br />\nEqually disturbing was Lombardi's failure to defend<br />\nHopkins against charges that it was the prototypical example of a research university gone mad. The academic<br />\nplight of undergraduates at Hopkins, while not especially<br />\nencouraging at many levels, particularly in the sciences,<br />\nis in some ways superior to that at many other \"elite\"<br />\nschools. At Hopkins, at any rate, one can safely say that<br />\nupperclassmen who haven't had any contact with professors while at the University probably have only<br />\nthemselves to blame. At the very least it would have been<br />\nencouraging to hear some comments from such a highlevel administrator which indicated a good understanding<br />\nof what it's like to be a Hopkins undergrad. Sykes'<br />\nstereotypes aside, Hopkins is not all TAs and cold<br />\nprofessors.<br />\nThis is especially true of many of the liberal arts at<br />\nHopkins, where it is not at all unusual for a graduating<br />\nsenior to have had nearly no TAs since freshman year introductory classes, and to have working relationships with<br />\nseveral professors thanks to small upper-level courses.<br />\nLombardi, of all people, should be aware of this situation;<br />\nan administrator and a professor, he teaches an<br />\nundergraduate class in the department of history with only<br />\ntwo students.<br />\nBy not energetically defending our arts and sciences<br />\nother than through hyperbolic references to a supposedly<br />\nstellar reputation, Lombardi did undergraduates no service. An understanding that it is not possible to generalize<br />\nabout undergraduate education at Johns Hopkins has been<br />\nlacking in national criticism of our university. Lombardi<br /><br />\nshould have contributed to a better understanding of the<br />\ntrue dynamics of the school, particularly with a man as<br />\ninfluential as Sykes as his audience, but ultimately he only kowtowed to facile stereotypes. If Hopkins is to lead<br />\nother universities towards better undergraduate teaching,<br />\nas some in the audience suggested we should, then the first<br />\nstep should be honest self-appraisal. Such honesty did not<br />\nabound on Tuesday evening.<br /><br />\nAttending to details<br />\nThroughout this year, the HOP has established trends<br />\nthat have helped to draw together the Hopkins community. Along with the return of Friday afternoon Hoppy<br />\nHours, the HOP has started new events such as the Monday Night Football Sports Extravaganza in the Rat.<br />\nThe HOP has now begun to plan for the installation of<br />\nan Entertainment Council. The purpose of the new council is to be twofold: to bring popular entertainment to an<br />\napparently uneventful campus, and second, to raise money<br />\nfor increased programming.<br />\nThe Hopkins student body, scattered throughout various<br />\nBaltimore zip codes, does need a compelling reason to<br />\nreturn to campus once they've trekked to their off-campus<br />\napartment or row house for the evening. By drawing quality performers regularly to Homewood, students will<br />\narguably have better opportunities to come together and<br />\nbuild a stronger sense of community. Money generated<br />\nfrom proceeds could go towards providing stronger<br />\nprogramming.<br />\nThe Entertainment Council is already looking forward<br />\nto Homecoming Weekend in April, when a big shin-dig<br />\nis planned in the U parking lot.<br />\nCouncil, however, should not limit itself to only long<br />\nrange, top-name billings. A variety of regular events are<br />\ncurrently held that Council should do more to promote.<br />\nFor example, local bands play most Wednesday nights at<br />\nChester's Place. Unfortunately, a majority of students<br />\naren't aware that Chester's is on-campus, located- on the<br />\nsecond floor of Levering Hall. And it's free. The Grad<br />\nClub is another spot (virtually on-campus) that has hosted<br />\nlocal performers for years. Council would do well to raise<br />\nawareness and an interest in such weekly events for a student body that apparently craves regular entertainment.<br />\nBy promoting entertainment already available on campus as well as long-range planning, Council could make<br />\ngreat strides towards immediately improving life at<br />\nHopkins. Council should encourage grass-roots campus<br />\ninitiatives rather than merely emphasize mega-budget extravaganzas.<br /><br />\nLetters<br />\nLombardi I<br />\nDr. Lombardi:<br />\nI was not able to ask this question Tuesday night, but I hope<br />\nthat you will still address it. On<br />\nTuesday, you made a statement<br />\nto the effect that if undergraduate<br />\neducation was as bad as the<br />\nreports make out, the country's<br />\nbest high school seniors would<br />\nnot still be eager to attend. Here,<br />\nan analogy best illustrates the<br />\npoint I wish to make. When<br />\npesticides were first marketed in<br />\nthe 1950s, in no way were these<br />\nchemicals said to be toxic or<br />\nharmful to any but pest plant or<br />\nanimal species. Being uninformed, the American people naively<br />\nbelieved they were not. Only<br />\nafter human and environmental<br />\ncosts were incurred were the<br />\nharmful effects of these chemicals<br />\nrecognized. Pesticide companies<br />\nare now required to disclose the<br />\ndangers as well as the benefits of<br />\ntheir products, to the consumer's<br />\nadvantage. I do not like the<br />\nanalogy of the modern university with a business any more than<br />\nMr. Sykes did; however, I am<br />\ntired of being a ;wive American<br />\nconsumer. When advertising<br />\nthemselves to uninformed high<br />\nschool seniors, the obvious thing<br />\nfor schools like Hopkins to do is<br />\ngloss over the pitfalls of<br />\nundergraduate education here<br />\n(faculty who ignore teaching,<br />\nTAs with no English skills, huge<br />\nclasses at the 300 level, etc.). Instead, they emphasize a largely<br />\ntheoretical 7:1 student-faculty<br />\nratio, reputation based on<br />\nresearch, and the value of the<br />\ndegree. We are paying for a product, Dr. Lombardi: regretfully,<br /><br />\nnot an education, but a degree. If<br />\nit were a car or a pesticide that<br />\nwe were purchasing, any consumer advocate would say that,<br />\nas uninformed potential buyers,<br />\nwe deserved all the facts before<br />\nwe invested time and money.<br />\nDon't you? Whi!.! a mediocre<br />\neducation will not cause death,<br />\nthe costs to the consumer, both<br />\nfinancial and intellectual, are just<br />\nas high.<br />\nElisabeth Inman<br /><br />\nLombardi II<br />\nTo the editors:<br />\nThe 1989 Milton Eisenhower<br /><br />\nSymposium deals directly with an<br />\nissue that should concern all<br />\nmembers of the Hopkins community. It consists of a series of<br />\nlectures addressing the value of<br />\nAmerican higher education today<br />\nand in the future. Student, and<br />\nspecifically undergraduate, attendance at the lectures thus far has<br />\nbeen impressive, as it should be.<br />\nUnfortunately, faculty attendance<br />\nhas been extremely disappointing. Aside from the lecture by<br />\nCharles Sykes, which many<br />\nfaculty members attended but remained silent during the questionand-answer session, low faculty<br />\nturnout has given students the<br />\nmessage that we are engaged in<br />\na losing battle.

I don't know how many<br />\nresidents of the Lone Star state attend Hopkins, though I don't<br />\nthink there are too many here to<br />\nget offended.

A pity. For as the 1980s steam to a<br />\nclose, it's become clear that the essay has<br />\nundergone a renaissance of sorts, establishing itself<br />\nas the modus operandi of some of America's most<br />\ncreative and, occasionally, irreverent literary<br />\nminds.<br />\nThis is a common cry; one hears it every year<br />\nwith the release of\"The Best American Essays,\"<br />\nwhich began publication in 1986.

But it should, and the 1989 edition of<br />\n\"The Best American Essays,\" edited by novelist<br />\nand critic Geoffrey Wolff, gives ample testimony<br />\nas to why.<br />\nOne needn't search for long to discover the virtues of the essay. First, it is a form based on fact:<br />\nessays enjoy an intimate connection to everyday<br />\nreality that fiction often ignores, or willfully<br />\nbypasses. Second, the best essays combine<br />\nmuscular structure\u2014or no apparent structure\u2014<br />\nwith a face-slapping immediacy that rivals the best<br />\nshort fiction. But third, and most important, essays<br />\nusually manage to inform readers as they entertain.<br />\nBetter still, the form allows almost limitless flexibility, far more than its long history might suggest. Nearly any subject is fair game, and length<br />\nSee ESSAYS, 10<br /><br />\nPublishing is a tough racket for authors and<br />\npublishers alike. The coincidence of artistic and<br />\ncommercial success is a rare occasion. The requirements of critical circles and the consuming<br />\npublic, it seems, are forever at odds. There are<br />\neditors who, in their darker moods, might even<br />\nclaim that the two are mutually exclusive.<br />\nAuthors have somewhat different concerns. For<br />\nthe multitude of young unknowns seeking to enter<br />\nthe short story market, the question is less what<br />\nshould they publish than where can they find a<br />\nmagazine or journal that will consent to publish<br />\ntheir work. For the better-known writers whose<br />\nmaterial has found greater acceptance, the material<br />\nrewards (money) improve (especially with prize<br />\ngigs like The New Yorker and Playboy) but there<br />\nare precious few who manage to eke out any sort<br />\nof living of it.<br />\nAgainst this background comes \"The Best<br />\nAmerican Short Stories 1989.\" Launched in 1915<br />\nand revitalized in 1978, \"Best American\"<br />\nmanages to fulfill the needs of both author and<br />\neditor.

While his playing was for<br />\nthe most part elegant and controlled, it was during a major memory lapse that Schulman exhibited<br />\nhis greatest charm.<br />\nThe mishap occurred during Paganini's \"Variations on one string on a Theme from Rossini's<br />\n'Moses'.\"Written originally for violin, but equally impressive on the cello, this virtuoso piece combines scales, arpreggios, and harmonics with a<br />\nsimple melody. Schulman, obviously absorbed in<br />\nthe negotiation of Paganini's pyrotechnics, made<br />\na structural \"wrong turn\" and ended up utterly<br />\nlost.<br />\nWhile many, more fragile performers would<br />\nhave cringed at this point, Schulman preserved his<br />\nrole as master of ceremonies. He stood up, chatted briefly at the piano with his collaborator,<br /><br />\n\u2022\u2022\u2022U<br />\n./W-.11.1\u2022011.11molm..<br />\n1111011100110bNIN.Nma.<br />\naleXIMINownow.m.<br />\n,....11\u2022~1.011101h.<br />\nINI.1101WWWWW1111k.<br />\n61<br />\n14<br />\n6<br />\nI ,,<br />\ntaM.<br /><br />\nAndrew Schulman<br />\nMargot Garrett, then, returning to his seat, continued. No nervous giggling ensued, only hearty<br />\nlaughter at the pianist's'perfectly-timed joke;<br />\nSchulman smiled without a twitch.<br />\nThis sort of behavior from a performer is an<br />\naudience's dream, just ag a loss of memory is<br />\nevery performer's nightmare. A crowd cannot be<br />\ncomfortable with a nervous player; Schulman's<br />\ngood humor served to turn this awkward moment<br />\ninto a beneficial one. Ultimately, the audience<br />\nseemed to cheer Schulman the man as much as<br />\nSchulman the musician.<br />\nWith an abundance of credentials to his name,<br />\nthe thirty-year-old Schulman is a highly<br />\nmarketable musician. It is noteworthy that much<br /><br />\nwriters allows publisher Houghton Mifflin to rope<br />\nin the public. This, then, is an attempt to find the<br />\nintersection between commerce and art.<br />\nDoubtless, asking Margaret Atwood, author of<br />\nthe best-selling \"Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Cat's<br />\nEye,\" to be this year's guest editor seemed like<br />\na good idea. Like Tyler and Updike, Atwood's<br />\nwork has found acceptance within both popular<br />\nand critical camps. Reading her introduction,<br />\nhowever, proves the contrary. \"Reading Blind,\"<br />\nwhich is also Atwood's metaphor for her selection process, is a mawkish opening\u2014the kind of<br />\nthing you might expect from a high-school speech<br />\nclass presentation. \"Whenever I'm asked to talk<br />\nabout what constitutes a 'good' story, or what<br />\nmakes one well-written 'better' than another,\" she<br />\nconfides, \"I begin to feel very uncomfortable.\"<br />\nThis \"awkwardness,\" it turns out, is her introduction's central theme. That she chooses to put works<br />\n\"good\" and \"better\" in quotations in a book that<br />\nclaims to contain the year's finest stories bodes<br />\nill for the reader. Throughout the introduction, At-<br /><br />\nwood undercuts whatever force her arguments<br />\nmight exert with relentless equanimity and flatfooted witticisms. Where last year's editor, Mark<br />\nHelprin, blasted the so-called minimalist school<br />\nof fiction for failing to say anything about the life<br />\naround them, Atwood simply chides them for ignoring \"the voice of the story\" and reminding<br />\nthem that\". . . understatement can be overdone,<br />\nplainsong can get too plain.\"<br />\nGranted, the editor's assignment is difficult.<br />\nWriting an introduction to a collection of stories<br />\nwhose only connection is that they have been<br />\ndeemed the year's finest is'a challenge best met<br />\nsimply by discussing the stories themselves.

Knopf<br />\n$17.95<br />\nby Rebecca Garron<br />\nScott Bradfield's first novel requires a renunciation of all that is familiar and secure: one's<br />\nsheltered, upper middle class, well-educated and\u2014<br />\nin the case of this reader\u2014relatively sane upbringing. With the opening words of eight-year-old<br />\nnarrator Phillip Davis, we are thrust into his shifting, unsteady, and distorted world. \"The History<br />\nof Luminous Motion\" begins with Phillip and his<br />\nmother homeless and driving with no particular<br /><br />\ndestination. We travel with Phillip from this<br />\naimless but happy driving through a brief interlude<br />\nin which his mother settles down with a hardware<br />\nstore owner who goes by the pseudonym Pedro,<br />\nto his final rooting (which will prove his undoing) in the California Valley.<br />\nThe journey in \"The History of Luminous Motion\" is, as well, a journey into the mind of the<br />\nyoung and disturbingly precocious Phillip. During the novel's early driving scenes, he is happy, warm, and, as narrator, lyrically aware of his<br />\nphysical surroundings: Bradfield exhibits a keen<br />\neye for the details of how a city works. Phillip<br />\nseems secure when he is alone and moving with<br />\nhis mother, for whom he feels a violently Oedipal<br />\nlove. As he settles down with Pedro, life becomes<br /><br />\nunhappy and Phillip withdraws, feels<br />\n\"abstract\"\u2014as if he were disappearing. After an<br />\nunnamed but clearly profound act of hatred for<br />\nPedro, Phillip and his mother return to the road<br />\nand, finally, settle down once again, this time by<br />\nthemselves, at which point Phillip's mother<br />\nretreats into alcoholic oblivion.<br />\nRodney and Beatrice enter where Mother exits. Rodney is a twelve-year old psychopath with<br />\nwhom Phillip burglarizes local homes; Beatrice<br />\nis the prophetic and somewhat pretentious girl who<br />\nbefriends them.

And director<br />\nHerbert Ross, of course, has to make it all stick<br />\ntogether.<br />\nBut with skill and perhaps a little luck,<br />\neverything confidently falls into place. \"Steel<br />\nMagnolias\" is well written and sharply acted, a<br />\npoignant and funny tale of six ordinary but resilient<br />\nwomen in the present day South. Neither the acting nor the film loses its focus, even as the<br />\ncharacters undergo a range of adversities.<br />\nAs the film begins, it appears that Annelle<br />\n(Daryl Hannah) will form the center of \"Steel<br />\nMagnolias.\" She's an easily rattled wallflower,<br />\nalthough she was \"valedictorian of the hairdo<br />\nclass.\" New to town, she finds work as an assistant to Truvy (Dolly Parton), whose creed is<br />\n\"there's no such thing as natural beauty.\"<br />\n\"Steel Magnolias\" seems to focus on holidays<br />\nand celebrations, which may account for the lack<br />\nof tension between the characters. It also makes<br />\none wonder what these people do with each other<br />\nwhen there isn't a party; one rarely sees them at<br />\ntheir jobs, for example, or doing anything like<br />\ngrocery shopping.<br />\nThey do get their hair done several times; this<br />\noffers the characters their most opportune<br />\nmoments for gabbing. Director Ross keeps these<br />\nscenes especially faithful to the play, at least in<br />\nlength. At the hairdresser, everyone gets along so<br />\ndamn well that one finds it irritating. But the<br />\ncharacters have sufficient quirks and funny lines<br />\nto compensate for the lack of all-out catfights.<br />\nMost of the holidays here seem like conveniently<br />\nplaced double-whammies: the film opens on Easter<br />\nweekend, which is also the weekend of Shelby's<br />\n(Julia Roberts) wedding. The details of the<br />\npreparations are frantic and genuine: while<br />\nShelby's father Drum (Tom Skeritt) blasts birds<br />\nout of the trees, her mother M'Lynn (Sally Field)<br />\ntries to prevent her sons from decorating the wedding car with inflated condoms.<br />\nAlthough the conflict which later develops betSee MOVIES, 12<br /><br />\n10/NOVEMBER 17, 1989<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\n0<br /><br />\nsurprise no one; it's simply how the publishing<br />\nracket works. In the end, \"The Best American<br />\nShort Stories 1989\" is no more than the sum of<br />\nits parts: commerce, compromise, credibility, and<br />\ncraft.

At worst,<br />\nthe stories are well-crafted trifles. Most, however,<br />\nare memorable in some small, but worthwhile<br />\nmanner. A very few are actually quite excellent.<br />\nBharati Mukherjee's \"The Management of<br />\nGrief\" belongs to this latter group. Winner of the<br />\n1989 National Book Critics Circle award for fiction and author of seven novels, Mukherjee<br />\ndemonstrates none of the academic stiffness present in the prose of a number of the other authors<br />\nhere. The first-person narrative voice she develops<br />\nin \"The Management of Grief\" is untrained and<br />\nexpressive. With it, she tells the story of an Indian housewife whose family is killed when their<br />\nAir India jet explodes over the Irish Sea, victims<br />\nof a terrorist bomb. Refusing to mourn until all<br />\nhope is gone, the narrator wanders the coast of<br />\nIreland, waiting patiently for their bodies to be<br />\ndredged from the icy waters. They're never found,<br />\nhowever, and the narrator takes it as a sign that<br />\nthey are not truly dead. Mukherjee's writing rings<br />\nwith calm power throughout the story, making<br />\neven its mysterious conclusion undeniable.<br />\nRick DeMarinis's \"The Flowers of Boredom,\"<br />\nan eerily detached account of employment within<br />\nthe defense industry, is of equal excellence.<br />\nDeMarinis creates a frighteningly alien yet realistic<br />\nworld in his nine pages. The narrator is selfconsciously aware of both the byzantine working<br />\nof the defense industry and the metaphoric<br />\nsignificance of the military's preoccupation with<br />\nmultiple back-up systems (as an analog to man's<br />\nfear of mortality). Yet aware as the narrator is of<br />\nhis surroundings, he is helpless to prevent them<br />\nfrom affecting his behavior. His self-consciousness<br />\nis no defense against his circumstances\u2014a powerful statement on post-modern America; it's an ambivalent, menacing story that DeMarinis writes.<br />\nThe allusion made to Baudelaire's\"Les Fleurs de<br />\nMal\" is especially apt. DeMarinis' new novel,<br />\n\"The Year of the Zinc Penny,\" came out just<br />\nrecently to rave reviews. On the basis of this story,<br />\none is inclined to believe them.<br />\nAt the other end of the spectrum are such works<br />\nas Charles Baxter's wandering \"Fenstad's<br />\nMother\" and Robert Boswell's melodramatic<br />\n\"Living to Be a Hundred.\" Despite their often<br />\nlovely prose, neither story is convincing. Dale Ray<br />\nPhilips's \"What Men Love For\" fares only slightly better, though again, largely due to his elegant<br />\nprose. Most of the rest fall between these two extremes. Of note are Mark Richard's \"Strays,\"<br />\nAlice Munro's \"Meneseteung,\" and Madison<br />\nSmartt Bell's \"Customs of the Country.\"<br />\nAs a collection, the conceit underlying \"The<br />\nBest American Short Stories 1989\" is not entirely palatable. While the 20 stories here are polished, professionally rendered, and eminently<br />\nreadable, it is easy to be frustrated by the collection's failed sense of adventure. Series editor<br />\nShannon Ravenel claims to read every story<br />\npublished by the nearly 200 journals and,<br />\nmagazines listed at the back of the book. Frankly, though, it's impossible to believe she honestly considers even a fraction of that number. More<br />\nthan a few critics poisonously nickname the series<br />\n\"The Best of the New Yorker,\" and for good<br />\nreason; four stories from the magazine were included in this year's edition, with an additional<br />\ntwelve listed in the appendix, \"100 Other<br />\nDistinguished Stories.\" With Harper's, Esquire,<br />\nand Atlantic, that accounts for nearly half of the<br />\ncollection.

(For illustration, compare<br />\nJohn Milton's mammoth, 17th-century<br />\n\"Areopagitica\" with Raymond Carver's recent<br />\n\"Fires,\" for example.) But traditions and structural freedoms aside, what makes an essay any<br />\ndifferent from the 30,000-word chunks of reportage that appear in The New Yorker? Or the less<br />\nsubstantial, 2,000-word clumps that Newsweek<br />\nkneads into a cover story each week?<br />\nWhen in doubt, look to the pages: Essays today, of which \"The Best American Essays 1989\"<br />\ncontains a fairly representative sampling, are as<br />\ndizzyingly diverse as contemporary fiction, and<br />\ngenerally less pretentious. They juggle their facts<br />\nmore adroitly\u2014and less conspicuously\u2014than the<br />\naverage news story, and they usually harbor crafty<br />\nintentions, aiming to pierce the reader's mind and<br />\nemotions with a single, seemingly casual shot.<br />\nOn this level, \"The Best American Essays<br />\n1989\" is a consistent success: of the twenty-one<br />\npieces collected here, a good sixteen are exceptional, or close. Novelist Julian Barnes contributes<br />\n\"Playing Chess with Arthur Koestler,\" which is<br />\nabout exactly that, although the matches he<br />\ndescribes are far from conventional in any sense.<br />\nOn the 1988 presidential election trail, Joan Didion provides insights and sharp reporting on the<br />\nsound-bite and photo-op events that were \"not<br />\nmerely meaningless but deliberately so . . . .\"<br />\nRobert Stone, at the 1988 Republican convention<br />\nin New Orleans, reflects warily on that city, its<br />\nchanging faces, and the ways in which politics and<br />\ncircumstance have altered the city's character over<br />\nthe years.

But be warned: merely to<br />\nstate the subjects of these essays conveys<br />\npathetically little of their presence on the page.<br />\nRichard Ford recalls the slice of his childhood<br />\nspent in a hotel managed by his grandfather, and<br />\nrenders the period in clean prose that evokes a<br />\ncrystalline sense of his feelings at the time. His<br />\nessay, \"Accomodations,\" isn't strictly about that<br />\nstay, and it doesn't necessarily paint a vivid<br />\nphysica! portrait of the hotel, but its pure energy<br />\nis at times exhilarating.<br /><br />\nThe honesty of some of the writers here can both<br />\ndisarm and be disarming. Judy Ruiz begins<br />\n\"Oranges and Sweet Sister Boy\" with a phone<br />\ncall from her brother\u2014\"he's calling to say that<br />\nhe is now my sister\"\u2014and goes on to investigate<br />\nsome of the odd fragments of her and her erstwhile<br />\nbrother's sexual pasts. In Edward Hoagland's astounding \"Heaven and Nature,\" perhaps the best<br />\nessay in the collection, the author recalls the circumstances surrounding the suicides of certain<br />\nfriends and acquaintances and reveals his own<br />\nsporadic fear that he, too, might take his own life.<br />\n\"It is profoundly startling,\" he writes, \"not to<br />\ntrust oneself after decades of doing so.\"<br />\nHoagland's essay, like perhaps half a dozen<br />\nothers in this collection, casually seizes a reader's<br /><br />\nThe JHU Barnstormers present:<br /><br />\nly vaguely see the opaqueness of the roof.

I was driving home from the<br />\nrig, having finished logging, going back out on<br />\nthe board road, which had flooded during the<br />\nnight: about half a foot of water stood above the<br />\nboards. I had to go slowly and guess where the<br />\nroad was and wasn't by looking at the lane cut<br />\nthrough the woods, and hoping the boards stayed<br />\nbeneath me. A few of them were floating loose,<br />\npointing in all directions. What I didn't know was<br />\nthat there was a very deep drainage ditch on either<br />\nside of the board road.<br />\nIt all looked the same with six inches of water<br />\ncovering it: like a broad, shallow, muddy swamp.<br />\nI drove slowly. I got off the board road and didn't<br />\nknow it. I was creeping along, water lapping just<br />\nbelow the headlights. Suddenly there was a downelevator feeling and brown water came rushing<br />\nup over the hood and onto my windshield. I didn't<br />\neven turn the ignition off; I scrambled out through<br />\nthe window and swam two strokes back to the<br />\nboard road while the muddy waters closed in<br />\naround the roof of my\u2014Mr. H.'s\u2014car.

Even if one knows<br />\nhow it's going to end (I certainly<br />\ndidn't), there's a certain pleasure<br />\nin knowing the elements<br />\nbeforehand and watching them<br />\ndevelop with the confidence of a<br />\nwell-structured story form.<br />\nThere are plenty of nice<br /><br />\ntouches in \"The Little Mermaid.\" The seven original songs<br />\nin the film were written by<br />\nHoward Ashman and Alan<br />\nMenken, who created \"The Little Shop of Horrors.\" You may<br />\nnot remember all of them when<br />\nyou leave, but they are pleasant<br />\nenough little melodies and add a<br />\nnice ring to the proceedings.<br />\nThe best song is \"Under the<br />\nSea,\" which is sung by Sebastian. It's not the lyrics or musical<br />\naccompaniment that make the<br />\nsong so special, but the spirited<br />\ncartoonesque activity around it.<br />\nSebastian is trying to convince<br />\nAriel that underwater life isn't<br />\nbad, and he enlists all of his sea<br />\nfriends to prove it. It's a whirling assortment of dancing and<br /><br />\nsinging starfish, dolphins, octopi,<br />\nstingrays, and seahorses, to name<br />\na few.<br />\nAdults watching cartoons find<br />\nmuch of their enjoyment in the<br />\nreactions of youngsters they've<br />\nbrought with them. Like most of<br />\nthose in the genre, the cartoon<br />\ncharacters in \"The Little Mermaid\" seem derivative, modeled<br />\nafter people we actually know to<br />\nexist. We end up comparing them<br />\nto real actors, not using them as<br />\npoints of reference as children<br />\nlikely would.<br />\nThis is only the fault of \"The<br />\nLittle Mermaid\" because the cartoon is so well-crafted.

The<br />\nend is reminiscent of \"Terms of<br />\nEndearment,\" due in part<br />\nperhaps to Maclaine's formidable<br />\npresence, but the difference is<br />\ndecidedly upbeat.<br /><br />\n'Oil<br />\nNotes'<br />\nOIL, from 10<br /><br />\nthird book of non-fiction (his first<br />\nstory collection, \"The Watch,\"<br />\nwas published in January) is also<br />\nlikely to make readers reconsider<br />\nfirst impressions.

Five years<br />\nlater, the doctors were asking him<br />\nwhy he didn't die.<br />\nThe real issue is changing<br />\nyourself. You may hate your job,<br />\nbut it takes something like cancer<br />\nto make you not go. Too many<br /><br />\npeople take life for granted; noticing your mortality will give you<br />\nfreedom, he says. Set out to live<br />\nuntil you die. As one cancer patient put it, \"I started to live for<br />\nthe moment and life became a<br />\nseries of moments.\" You don't<br />\ndo it to not die, but to enjoy. Also<br />\nwhen you take charge of living,<br />\ndying is easier; modern medicine<br />\ndoesn't help deal with that. He<br />\nsays to do little things like taking<br />\n\"healing intervals\" during the<br />\nday and listen to music, take a<br />\nwalk, look at flowers, whatever<br />\nit takes to let you stop and not let<br />\nlife pass you by. \"Make every<br />\nday precious,\" Bernie repeatedly stressed. Consider if you were<br />\nin an accident and had time before<br />\nyou died to think about, all the<br />\nthings in life that you had been<br />\ntoo scared to try and all that you<br />\nhad put up with. Why havent't<br />\nyou? It's a good question.<br />\nBernie also stressed the importance of sharing. \"Groups are<br />\ngood because they are safe.\" In<br />\na study conducted by a<br />\npsychiatrist at Stanford University, 86 women with breast<br />\ncancer were divided into two<br />\ngroups. Group 1 received the<br />\nstandard medical treatment,<br />\nchemotherapy, radiation treatment, etc., and Group 2 received the same treatment plus weekly group therapy sessions where<br />\neveryone could vent her emotions<br />\nand offer mutual support. Group<br />\nl averaged 18.9 months without<br />\nrecurrence, but Group 2 averaged 36.6 months without<br />\nrecurrence.<br />\nMany projects have come out<br />\nof group theory, where honesty<br />\nand expressing yourself are emphasized. One such project was<br /><br />\nhaving half of one group during<br />\nthe course of the day stop and<br />\ncheck their feelings every hour,<br />\nand keep a journal of their feelings. The immune systems of<br />\nthose who kept journals of their<br />\nfeelings were more active than<br />\nthose who didn't express their<br />\nfeelings in writing.<br />\nHolistic medicine, as Siegel's<br />\nideas are called, is nothing new.<br />\nPlato himself cited the importance<br />\nof treating the whose patient, not<br />\njust the disease. Hippocrates also<br />\ntaught healers the importance of<br />\nnot doing anything that would interfere with the bod,y's natural<br />\nhealing process whether it be<br />\nmental or physical. In the<br />\nliterature about holistic medicine<br />\nthat the National Cancer Institute<br />\ngives to its patients, it says that,<br />\n\"health professionals are realizing that health depends on a<br />\ndelicate interaction of organic,<br />\npsychological, social, and<br />\ncultural forces, and that for healing to be effective it must consider all these areas.\"<br />\nBernie, however, does not<br /><br />\nwork without criticsm. His<br />\ngreatest problem it seems, is to<br />\nnot be cast with groups such as<br />\nthe Iridologists, who diagnose patients by detailed examination of<br />\nthe iris, and Polarity practitioners, who heal by pressure<br />\npoint message. It is true, though,<br />\nthat almost everything has been<br />\nhailed at one point or another as<br />\na cure or prevention of cancer, including extremely questionable<br />\npractices such as coffee enemas!<br />\nBernie says that he is not among<br />\nthese and that it must be<br />\nunderstood that holistic medicine<br />\nis merely an alternative treatment.<br />\nProven medical therapy is part of<br />\ntreatment, to be sure, but the patient must be treated as a whole.<br />\n\"Don't be afraid to give and<br />\naccept unconditional love,\" said<br />\nBernie. The central theme is to<br />\nimprove the quality of your life.<br />\nSome people ask,\"Why does this<br />\nhappen to me?\" Well, the truth<br />\nis, if you're alive, things are going to happen.

For the<br />\nsecond consecutive year the Jays<br />\navoided a winless campaign by<br />\ntopping the Terrors in the finale.<br />\nIt was a long, frustrating year<br />\nfor the Jays. \"I'm proud of our<br />\nguys for hanging in so long this<br />\nseason,\" said Pfeifer. \"It was as<br />\nthough this game was scripted for<br />\nus.\"<br />\nThe Jay offense gained 463<br />\nyards, 309 rushing, and 154 passing. Achieving 29 first downs,<br />\nthe Jays broke the school record<br />\nof 26, set in 1980.<br />\nOn the ground, Eric Mont carried the ball 19 times for 103<br />\nyards, and John Guglielmo did an<br />\nimpressive job of scrambling, as<br />\nhe gathered 125 yards. In the air,<br />\nhe was equally effective,connecting on 12 of 17 passes for 154<br />\nyards and a touchdown.<br />\nBrandon Rosser helped his<br />\nquarterback by catching 10 passes<br />\nfor 114 yards. Rosser was 3<br />\nreceptions short of tying the<br />\nHopkins single-game record.<br />\n\"John was phenomenal,\" said<br />\nsenior center Fred Conroy. \"He<br />\nplayed the best game any quarterback at Hopkins has had in my<br />\nfour years. He matured so much<br />\nthis season.\"<br />\nThe defense forced the Terrors<br />\nto punt on their first series. The<br />\nTerrors had the ball on the Jays'<br />\n20-yard line, but 2 quick losses<br /><br />\nput them on the 33, where they<br />\npunted on fourth down.<br />\nJohn Darre, who has been the<br />\nJays' top return man, brought the<br />\nball 20 yards to the Jays' 30. Six<br />\nplays later, the team had the ball<br />\non the 35-yard line of Western<br />\nMaryland, where, on fourth-andone, Guglielmo connected to<br />\nMike Hallenback for a<br />\ntouchdown. Darre's PAT put<br />\nHopkins up 7-0.<br />\nEarly in the second quarter, the<br />\nJays had a first-and-goal situation<br />\nbut got nothing as Guglielmo was<br />\nintercepted for a touchback.<br />\nThe Terrors then went 80 yards<br />\non three plays to tie the score.<br />\nThe only other score of the half<br />\ncame on Darre's 31-yard field<br />\ngoal into the wind. To get in<br />\nDarre's range, the Jays moved<br />\nthe ball 55 yards on four plays in<br />\n30 seconds as Guglielmo connected to Rosser for 3 consecutive first downs. On what<br />\nshould have been the last play of<br />\nthe half, Guglielmo threw an incomplete into the end zone.<br />\nHowever, a deadball foul against<br />\nWestern Maryland set up the field<br />\ngoal attempt.<br />\nEarlier in the quarter, the officials nullified what would have<br />\nbeen a 47-yard touchdown pass<br />\nto Chris Ogeneski. On the play,<br />\nGuglielmo had been flushed out<br />\nof the pocket and had thrown past<br />\nthe line of scrimmage.<br />\nThe field goal raised the team's<br />\nspirit even more. \"Once the<br />\ngame started, we knew that we<br />\nwere going to beat them really<br />\nbad,\" said captain Steve Davis.<br />\n\"They were not as good as they<br /><br />\nwere supposed to be.\"<br />\nThe Terrors were not terrible,<br />\nbut seemed out of sync, as they<br />\npassed much more typically.<br />\nNormally, Eric Frees carries the<br />\nball 40 to 50 times a game and<br />\nearns more than 100 yards. Saturday, he got only 83 yards on 16<br />\ncarries.<br />\nWestern Maryland quarterback<br />\nJoe Hamm completed only 50<br />\npercent of his passes, and suffered three interceptions as he had<br />\nto throw a lot on second and third<br />\ndowns.<br />\nThe first drive of the Jays in the<br />\nthird quarter was capped off by<br />\nPaul<br />\nFerreri's<br />\none-yard<br />\ntouchdown run, putting the Jays<br />\nup 17-7.<br />\nThe Jays' next score was set up<br />\nby the defense as Steve Davis<br />\nrecovered a fumble. Eight plays<br />\nlater, Mont sprinted 16 yards into the end zone on a sweep. \"The<br />\noffensive line did a heck of a<br />\njob,\" said Mont. \"The holes they<br />\nopened up were the biggest I've<br />\never seen.

Overall, meetwise,<br />\nit depends on who's been<br />\nrecruited by the big schools.\"<br />\nLed by co-captain Andrew<br />\n\"A.J.\" Jablonowski, six sabre<br />\nfencers will compete in Saturday's tournament. Of the three<br />\nweapons, \"Sabre probably looks<br />\nstrongest on paper,\" says Oles.<br />\nAlthough the order of spots has<br />\nyet to be set, the competitors will<br />\nprobably include Jablonowski,<br />\njuniors Robert McClay, John<br /><br />\nO'Connell, Peter Kim, and Juan<br />\nSuros, and sophomore John Call.<br />\nIn foil competition, seniors<br />\nYen-len Tang and co-captain<br />\nMichael B. Greenfield will be<br />\njoined by junior Li-Kuo Kong and<br />\nsophomore Richard Millheiser.<br />\n\"The foil fencers,\" remarked<br />\nOles, \"are consistently very<br />\nstrong. Last year, the group was<br />\nmore uneven, with outstanding<br />\nand intermediate players mixed.<br />\nThis year's team is about the<br />\nsame, but more solid.\"<br />\nAs in past seasons, epee appears a bit weaker than the other<br />\ndivisions at first, but, Oles is<br />\nquick to add, \"Our program<br />\ntends to make excellent epee<br />\nfencers [by the end of the<br />\nseason].\" Starters include returning co-captain Tim Train,junior<br />\nAndrew Donnalley, sophomores<br />\nJason Coleman and Jorge Gana,<br />\nand one of the few freshmen on<br />\nthe team, Bill Podurgiel.<br />\nOverall, Oles has high expectations for his team. \"Given that<br />\nwe usually win two-thirds of our<br />\nmeets,\" he says,\"we want to see<br />\nhow close we can come to a<br />\nperfect record.\"<br />\nRegarding last year's disappointment at the Nationals, Coach<br />\nOles feels that \"Everybody thinks<br />\nwe should have won it, and<br />\neverybody is out to prove<br />\nsomething this year.\"<br /><br />\nCross country concludes<br />\nseason at NCAA's<br />\nby Coleen Furey<br /><br />\n,<br /><br />\nThe Johns Hopkins men's and<br />\nwomen's cross country teams<br />\nfinished off their seasons last<br />\nSaturday at the NCAA Regional<br />\nChampionships in Allentown,<br />\nPA. The women's team ran extremely well, as they placed ninth<br />\nout of twenty-six teams. The<br />\nmen's team also ran fairly well,<br />\nplacing twelfth out of twenty-five<br />\nteams.<br />\nFor the women, the first four<br />\nrunners ran phenomenally well.<br />\nDiana Logan had one of her best<br />\nraces of the season, as she placed twenty-fifth in 20:42. Tami<br />\nMeyer also had an excellent race<br />\nwith her finishing time of 20:47.<br />\nAudra Mai, who usually finishes<br />\nfirst for Hopkins, still had a great<br />\nrace with a time of 20:49. Anna<br />\nLee Bamforth also ran well for<br />\nHopkins, as she finished the race<br />\nin 21:15. Helen Hostin was suffering from a back injury, but she<br />\nstill finished the race in 22:47.<br />\nCoach Simonsick was very<br />\npleased with the team's performance at the close of the season.<br />\nSimonsick comments that the<br />\nteam will greatly miss Mai,<br />\nLogan, and Bamforth next<br />\nseason, but the incoming prospects are looking good for next<br />\nyear.<br />\nThe men's team greatly improved over their previous performances at this championship<br />\nmeet. John Robinson led his team<br />\nonce again with a fifteenth place<br />\nfinish in 26:37. Pete Gliatto also<br />\nran very well with his finishing<br />\ntime of 27:45. Erik Schweitzer,<br />\nwho was running his last collegiate race, ran extremely well<br />\nwith a finishing time of 27:48.<br />\nCoach Grogan commented on the<br />\ncontributions of Schweitzer to the<br />\nteam over the past years, and he<br />\nexplained that Schweitzer \"improved every year that he was<br />\nhere.\" Bassil Dahiyat and Manny Hostin were the next two<br />\nHopkins runners to finish the<br />\nrace, in 28:44 and 29:34,<br />\nrespectively.<br /><br />\nCoach Grogan was also very<br />\npleased with the team's finishing<br />\nperformance this season.

This year,<br />\nthe team will be asked to advance<br />\nit. The 1988-89 Blue Jays exceeded expectations by compiling a<br />\n17-10 record, and advancing to<br />\nthe Middle Atlantic Conference<br />\nSouthern Division finals, where<br />\nnationally-ranked Franklin &amp;<br />\nMarshall topped the Jays by five.<br />\nFor 1989-90, head coach Bill<br />\nNelson will have to deal with the<br />\nloss to graduation of MACSoutheast Most Valuable Player<br />\nMike Latimore and starter Jedan<br />\nPhillips. Latimore and Phillips<br />\nwere the team's top rebounders<br />\nand two of its three leading<br />\nscorers. The pair contributed an<br />\naverage of 11 rebounds and more<br />\nthan 26 points per game.<br />\nThe remainder of the team has<br />\nbeen kept virtually intact. Nine<br />\nplayers who saw significant time<br />\nlast season are returning, including 6'8\" center Joel Siepierski, who missed the last five<br />\ngames of last season due to illness.<br />\nNelson points to the team's better overall quickness, which<br />\nshould bolster the defense, and<br />\nadded experience gained from<br />\nlast year's playoff games as factors which could improve the<br />\nteam's performance as a whole.<br />\nRebounding, however, will be \"a<br />\nmajor concern\" of Nelson's<br />\nbecause of the loss of Latimore<br />\nand Phillips. Nelson hopes his<br />\nteam can compensate for limited<br />\nheight with increased intensity,determination, and quickness.<br />\nThe Jays will still feature the<br />\ntough man-to-man defense and<br />\nfamiliar \"motion\" and \"power\"<br />\noffenses that are the trademarks<br />\nof coach Nelson. As a smaller<br />\nteam, Hopkins might have a more<br />\ndifficult time scoring inside, but<br />\nNelson won't rely on outside<br />\nshooting alone.<br />\n\"We have to go inside first to<br />\nset up our perimeter game; otherwise people will key on our outside shooters,\" he said. Siepierski, who had orthroscopic knee<br />\nsurgery four weeks ago, might be<br />\nthe one to shoulder that burden.<br />\n\"The leg is pretty much heal-<br /><br />\nDavid Eikenberg<br />\n5'10\"<br />\nJr<br />\nG<br /><br />\nJr<br /><br />\ned, and I should be at full strength<br />\nby the end of winter break,\" he<br />\nsaid. \"As long as we can keep<br />\na good inside game, we have the<br />\npotential to improve. We have a<br />\ntough schedule,\" said Nelson. He<br />\nconceded that he might use more<br />\nof the motion offense because the<br />\nteam is generally better suited to<br />\nit.<br />\nWhen he does go to the outside<br />\ngame he will look to shooting<br />\nguard Andy Enfield to lead the<br />\nway. \"Andy's one of the premier<br />\nreturning players in Division<br />\nIII,\" Nelson said. Enfield led<br />\nHopkins in scoring last year with<br />\na 16.4 average. He also finished<br />\nsecond in the country in free<br />\nthrow percentage (91.5 percent)<br />\nand shot 50 percent from threepoint range.<br />\nPoint guard could be a key<br />\nposition for the Blue Jays this<br />\nyear because David Strong may<br />\nmiss the entire season with a back<br />\ninjury. That will put added<br />\npressure on David Eikenberg,<br />\nwho developed a reputation for<br />\ncanning clutch free throws down<br />\nthe stretch at the end of last<br />\nseason. Strong and Eikenberg had<br />\nsplit the point guard duties last<br />\nseason.<br />\nOther returning players include<br />\nsenior Kevin Roller and<br />\nsophomores Jay Gangemi, Mark<br />\nWest, and Evan Jones, who all<br />\nmade positive contributions last<br />\nyear and should see even more<br />\nplaying time this year. Gangemi<br />\nis expected to assume more of the<br />\nscoring load, and Roller and West<br />\nwill have to play some back-up<br />\npoint guard due to Strong's<br />\nabsence.<br />\nForwards Bill Zahn and Eric<br /><br />\nHastings also return. Hulking forward Joe Shiber decided to take<br />\nthe year off to concentrate on<br />\nacademics and housemaster<br />\nresponsibilities.<br />\nDepth will again be a Hopkins<br />\nattribute. \"Last year one of the<br />\nmain reasons we were successful<br />\nwas that we had fresh people in<br />\nthe game quite a bit,\" Nelson<br />\nsaid. Nelson said he substituted<br />\nmore last year than in any other<br />\nof his nine years as a collegiate<br />\nhead coach.<br />\n\"If there's a big discrepancy<br />\nbetween our first team and our second team, the starters will see a<br />\nlot of action. If we have parity,<br />\nwe'll continue to sub.\"<br />\nThe Jays' prize newcomer is<br />\n6'4\" forward/center Nestor<br />\nRodriguez out of New York City. Rodriguez could help Hastings<br />\nand Siepierski fill the void in the<br />\nmiddle caused by the graduation<br />\nlosses. He will have to learn the<br />\nHopkins system, especially manto-man defense. Rodriguez<br />\nplayed zone defense almost exclusively in high school. He will<br />\nnot have the luxury of breaking<br />\nin with a junior varsity team, as<br />\nNelson cancelled the program this<br />\nyear.<br />\nIf the Jays<br />\nachieve their<br />\npotential and remain injury-free,<br />\nthe Blue Jays have a good shot to<br />\nmake the Division III tournament<br />\nthis year.

The Blue<br />\nJays compiled a 12-10 record to<br />\nturn in their first-ever winning<br />\nseason.<br />\nLast year's young team, composed entirely of freshmen and<br />\nsophomores, earned a third-place<br />\nfinish in the Mid-Atlantic Conference (MAC) Southwest<br />\nLeague with a 5-5 record.<br />\nHopkins defeated Lebanon Valley<br />\n(twice), Swarthmore, Dickinson<br />\nand Gettysburg, but fell twice to<br />\nFranklin &amp; Marshall, a team<br />\nranked throughout the season in<br />\nthe top ten of NCAA Division III<br />\nwomen's basketball poll.<br />\nThe Blue Jays also put in an<br />\nimpressive performance in the<br />\ncompetitive University Athletic<br />\nAssociation (UAA) with a 4-4,<br />\nfourth-place finish. In UAA action, Hopkins defeated Chicago,<br />\nRochester, Emory, and Case<br />\nWestern Reserve.<br />\nLast season's unprecedented<br />\nsuccess seems to be serving as a<br />\nmotivator to this year's women.<br />\nThe Blue Jays have started training early this year, combining<br />\nweight and strength training with<br />\na cardiovascular program to<br />\nready themselves physically.<br />\nThe Blue Jays will be led by a<br />\nstrong core of veteran athletes.<br />\n\"This year's team is well seasoned,\" comments fourth-year coach<br />\nNancy Blank. \"They show more<br />\npoise and have a stronger<br />\npresence on the court.\" Blank has<br />\n12 years of head coaching experience behind her, and has used this experience to turn the<br />\nyoung team into winners.<br />\nLeadership should be no problem for the Jays. As<br />\nsophomores, co-captains Juliane<br />\nRolapp (DarreStown, MD) and<br />\nKristieKantowski (Ellicott City,<br />\nMD) averaged 11.1 and 10.9<br />\npoints per game, respectively.<br />\n\"Juliane was the most consistent player on the floor for us,\"<br />\npraised Blank. \"Her leadership<br />\nwas instrumental in our success.\"<br />\nAt 5'5\" (the team's shortest<br />\nplayer), Rolapp pulled down 4.2<br />\nrebounds per game while recor-<br /><br />\nTraci Williams<br />\nSo<br />\n5'7\"<br />\n9.2 points per game while recording 68 steals.<br />\nRounding out the talented<br />\nsophomore class is 5'11 Kelly<br />\nVan Houten (Little Falls, NJ).<br />\nVan Houten averaged almost 5<br />\npoints per game last season, as<br />\nwell as recording an average of<br />\n4.3 rebounds. The experienced<br />\ncenter/forward is a \"steady, consistent post player with outstanding offensive rebounding ability, good timing, and a strong second shot.\"<br />\nJoining the eight veterans are<br />\nfour promising recruits, all with<br />\nstrong individual talent. Blank expects \"the freshmen to contribute<br />\nto the success of this year's team.<br />\nThey all could see significant<br />\nplaying time.\"<br />\nTricia Hacker (Cedar Lake,<br />\nIN), a 5'10\" forward, comes<br />\nfrom Crown Point High School,<br />\none of the winningest women's<br />\nbasketball programs in Indiana.<br />\n\"Tricia is one of the most fundamentally sound players we've<br />\never had,\" commented Blank.<br />\n\"She is a great addition to the<br />\nteam.\"<br />\nSara Cushing (Guilford, CT),<br />\na 5'7\" guard, comes to Hopkins<br />\nfrom Guilford High School.<br />\nCushing has \"good shooting<br />\nstrength,\" according to Blank.<br />\n\"She should gain more experience as the season progresses<br />\nas an off guard.\"<br />\nSylke Knuppel (Woodbine,<br />\nMD) was last year's Baltimore<br />\nSun Player of the Year.

The<br />\n5'11\" forward, who suffered a<br />\nshoulder injury early on in the<br />\npre-season, will be a loss for the<br />\nJays as a power forward or post<br />\nplayer.<br />\nCoach Blank is hesitant to<br />\nmake predictions about the upcoming season, but is optimistic<br />\nabout the prospect of success.<br />\nSee WOMEN, 19<br /><br />\nSylke Knuppel<br />\nFr<br />\n510\"<br />\nG<br /><br />\n1989-90 Women's Basketball Roster<br />\nNQA<br />\n5<br />\n11<br />\n12<br />\n14<br />\n15<br />\n20<br />\n23<br />\n24<br />\n31<br />\n33<br />\n44<br />\n54<br /><br />\nr125.<br /><br />\nTracy Williams<br />\nKern McTiernan<br />\n* Mary Hillebrand<br />\nJennifer Luzietti<br />\n* Juliane Rolapp<br />\nTricia Hacker<br />\nJulie Slye<br />\n* Kristiq Kantowski<br />\nSara Cushing<br />\nSylke Knuppel<br />\nJoAnna Sychterz<br />\nKelly Van Houten<br /><br />\nHead Coach: Nancy Blank<br />\n* tri-captain<br />\n6<br /><br />\nG/F<br />\nG/F<br /><br />\nC/F<br /><br />\nHometown / High School<br /><br />\nILL<br />\n5'7\"<br />\n5'6\"<br />\n5'8\"<br />\n5'9\"<br />\n5'5\"<br />\n5'9\"<br />\n6'4\"<br />\n6'1\"<br />\n5'7\"<br />\n5'10\"<br /><br />\nSo.<br />\nSo.<br />\nJr.<br />\nJr.<br /><br />\n5'11\"<br />\n5'11\"<br /><br />\nFr.<br />\nSo.<br /><br />\nJr.<br />\nFr.<br />\nSo.<br />\nJr.<br />\nFr.<br />\nFr.<br /><br />\nShort Hills, NJ / Millburn<br />\nStaten Island, NY / St. Joseph Hill<br />\nJanesville, WI / J.A.

We want to be the first<br />\nteam in Hopkins women's basketball history to get into the MAC<br />\nplayoffs. And obviously we want<br />\nto win.
