Football is one of those<br />\nsports whose record has not been<br />\nanywhere near wonderful.<br />\nBecause of this, 200 fans at the<br />\nopening game of the year was all<br />\nthat turned out. The players,<br />\ncoaches, and others involved in<br />\nthe program, though, work as<br />\nhard as any other sport.

Why do the electrical<br />\nengineers and pre-med students<br />\nthen bother to take the time to<br />\ncome out for a losing team?<br />\nRick Law, center and<br />\nsophomore from Baltimore, is a<br />\nsuperb example of what athletics<br />\nat Hopkins are all about. An<br />\nenvironmental engineer major, he<br />\ngets none of the breaks that a<br />\nfootball player at University of<br />\nMaryland would get. None of the<br />\ncars, special tutors, special food,<br />\nspecial dorms, as a matter of fact<br />\nthe football squad here gets no<br />\n<br />\nspecial anything. The students<br />\ndon't even appreciate his<br />\ndedication by showing up for the<br />\ngames.<br />\nWhat Rick does get is a<br />\ntremendous sense of a job well<br />\ndone, camaraderie, and a chance<br />\nto get out on that field and<br />\nrelease the tremendous amount<br />\nof pressure that the academics<br />\nplace on aperson at JHU. And he<br />\nis good at the center position.<br />\nHead coach Denny Cox describes<br />\nLaw as more than just a super<br />\nperson. \"He's dedicated, loyal<br />\nand hardworking, I can't say one<br />\nbad thing about him. He does not<br />\nrely on pure strength or ability to<br />\nget the job done. He leans heavily<br />\non technique. He's the most<br />\nconsistent offensive linesman for<br />\nthe past two years.\"<br />\nStudent coach Bill McEnroe<br />\nonly duplicates the coach's high<br />\npraise of the team's center.<br />\n\"Ricky's doing the work in the<br />\ntrenches. He blocks for the<br />\nbacks. Most people watch the<br />\nball, and never see the linesman<br />\nwho tre doing the bulwark. But<br />\nthey don't want credit. Their<br />\nsatisfaction comes form within.<br />\nWhen our team scores, within the<br />\nteam its know who has made the<br />\nblocks.\"<br />\nLaw himself doesn't want the<br />\ncredit. \"No recognition doesn't<br />\nbother me. If I have a good<br />\n<br />\nblock, a touchdown block, it's<br />\nbetter than if I was running with<br />\nthe ball. I work all week for<br />\nSaturday. If it was good then I<br />\nfeel good.

But you<br />\nhave to put it out of your mind.<br />\nBut I'll get my credit sooner or<br />\nlater, the whole team will.<br />\nThe stereotype that surrounds<br />\nfootball players just doesn't exist<br />\nat Hopkins. Jocks aren't<br />\nadmitted on the basis of their<br />\nathletic prowess only. They go<br />\nthrough he regular admissions<br />\nprocess just like the rest of the<br />\nstudents here. Law would never<br />\ngive up his future in<br />\nEnvironmental engineering to<br />\nplay at a school like The<br />\nUniversity of Maryland with a<br />\nsuperiOr football program, but<br />\nterribly inferior academics. \"I<br />\nwouldn't give up engineering to<br />\nplay for Maryland.

Then on top<br />\nof everything, the high school<br />\nstars that come here expect some<br />\namount of crowds, and then they<br />\nget nothing.\"<br />\nThe entire football situation at<br />\nthe Hop then must revolve<br />\n,,round something other than the<br />\nfans and fringe benefits. The<br />\nreward must be personal. Rick<br />\nLaw is an unsung hero in the<br />\noffensive line and an unadmired<br />\nfootball player at Hopkins knows<br />\nthat only too well.\" You have to<br />\nenjoy it.

According to<br />\nthe 1973 Student Council has<br />\nMuller, the Board of Trustees<br />\nupset many members of the<br />\nfor a higher increase, but<br />\nasked<br />\npresent Council, especially<br />\nhe limited the 1978-79 fees to<br />\nPresident David Chesanow.<br />\nS4,050.<br />\n\"In 1973 the Council failed to<br />\nHe explained that the<br />\ninsure that the code was<br />\nproposed tuition increase is low<br />\neffectually validated.

Dr.<br />\nMuller also pointed out that<br />\nunlike most undergraduate<br />\ncolleges, Hopkins could not shut<br />\ndown many buildings, because of<br />\nthe many research facilities used<br />\nduring winter recess. According<br />\nto a report distributed by Dr.<br />\nMuller at the meeting, the<br />\nUniversity has actually decreased<br />\nenergy consumption, although<br />\nthe total fuel bill has increased<br />\nsome one-and -a-half million<br />\ndollars since 1973.<br />\nWhen asked about why tile<br />\nConsumer Price Index for the<br /><br />\nUniversity was higher than that<br />\nof the nationwide CPI, Dr. Muller<br />\nreplied that unlike the rest of the<br />\nnation, the University deals<br />\nmostly with books, utilities,<br />\npaper, etc., which have increased<br />\nfaster in price than such<br />\ncommodities as food, clothing,<br />\nand transportation, which the<br />\nUniversity does not deal with.<br />\nFollowing a 27 minute talk,<br />\nPresident Muller spent the next<br />\nhour answering questions. Dr.<br />\nMuller explained that the<br />\nUniversity is not asking the<br />\nstudents to pay all the costs, and<br />\nthat in fact Hopkins is less<br />\ndependent upon tuition fees than<br />\nmost schools. He noted, however,<br />\ntitat the increase is necessary to<br />\nprotect the University<br />\nendowment.<br />\nPresident Muller expressed his<br />\ndissatisfaction with the federal<br />\nand state scholarship systems, for<br />\nthe uncertainty of such national<br />\nprograms make budgeting all the<br />\nmore difficult a task. \"The<br />\ncomplications now in the<br />\nDepartment of Health, Education<br />\nand Welfare, and the U.S. Office<br />\nof Education are enormous,\" he<br />\ncommented, \"and the Maryland<br />\nstate scholarship system is<br />\nlousy.\" .<br />\nThere was no announcement<br />\nconcerning Peabody tuition,<br />\nbecause, although the<br />\nresponsibility for the final<br />\ndecision rests with Dr. Muller,<br />\nthe University intends to allow<br />\nPeabody to run on its own<br />\nbudgetary schedule. \"They<br />\nusually don't make that decision<br />\nuntil much later in the year,\"<br />\nstated Dr. Muller.<br />\nPeabody students, who now<br />\nSEE \"TUITION,\" PAGE 3.<br /><br />\neabody to get governed<br /><br />\nSC to Establish Book Co-o<br />\nBY KATHLEEN TROY<br />\nThe Student Council has<br />\nproposed the establishment of a<br />\nbook co-op on campus which<br />\nwould offer texts to students at a<br />\nlower price than those currently<br />\nOffered by the Hopkins Book<br />\nCenter, the University-based<br />\nbookstore. The proposal is not a<br />\nnew one; the Student Council has<br />\ndiscussed the possibility of setting<br />\nUp a co-op for several years. But<br />\nif the plan materializes this time,<br />\nHopkins students will be able to<br />\norder books at a discount price<br />\nstarting next semester.<br />\nIn past years, proposals for the<br />\nestablishment of a book co-op<br />\nhave raised questions about the<br />\nlegality of such a move. The<br /><br />\nUniversity has a contract with<br />\nFollett's which prohibits the<br />\nintroduction of a competing<br />\nestablishment on campus. Dave<br />\nChcsanow, President of the<br />\nStudent Council, said that the<br />\nproposed co-op will not interfere<br />\nwith the University's contract<br />\nbecause Follett's handles a wide<br />\nrange of books and supplies that<br />\nthe co-op will not.<br />\nInitially, the co-op will offer<br />\nonly books for courses that are<br />\nbeing given regularly\u2014either for<br />\nthe first or second semesters\u2014and<br />\nonly those books that are<br />\ncommonly used, required texts.<br />\nBooks will not be ordered for<br />\ncourses that are being offered for<br />\nthe first time or that have a very<br /><br />\nlimited number of students. In<br />\nthe beginning, the co-op will try<br />\nto benefit the greatest number of<br />\nstudents. Therefore books for<br />\nlower-level, and required courses<br />\nwill probably be the only ones<br />\navailable. After the co-op nas<br />\nestablished a reliable credit<br />\nrecord with the publisher, books<br />\nmay be offered for a wider range<br />\nof courses.<br />\nThe co-op would operate out<br />\nof the small room across from<br />\nthe Student Council office on the<br />\nsecond floor of Levering Hall. At<br />\nfirst, students would place orders<br />\nfor books at the end of the<br />\nprevious semester, paying cash<br />\nwhen ordering and receiving the<br />\nSEE \"BOOKS,\" PAGE 15.<br /><br />\nBY TYRONE SLOTHRUP<br />\nStudents of the Peabody<br />\nConservatory will take the first<br />\nstep aimed at restoring student<br />\ngovernment there this Monday<br />\nand Tuesday, when they vote on<br />\n\u2022<br />\na proposed constitution.<br />\nThe constitution, which wi.s<br />\ndrawn up this summer by an ad<br />\nhoc committee, was basically<br />\nmodelled on the Hopkins<br />\nStudent Council constitution.<br />\nOnce the preliminary bersion had<br />\nbeen drawn up, it was presented<br />\nto the student body at large on<br />\nthe 21st and 28th of this month.<br />\nRevisions were discussed and<br />\nvoted 'upon, and incorporated in<br />\nthe final version to be presented<br />\nin the referendum.<br />\nAs with most student<br />\ngovernments, the officers shall<br />\nconsist of a President,<br />\nVice-President, Secretary and a<br />\nTreasurer.

Coupled with<br />\nSchlechter's performance in the<br />\nair (7-13 for 93 yards), the Mules<br />\nnet offensive yardage count of<br />\n507 eclipsed the Jays' meager<br />\noffense that mustered a paltry 99<br /><br />\nyards (83 on the ground and 16<br />\nthrough the air on four<br />\ncompletions out of 12 attempts<br />\nby Jay signal caller, Bob<br />\nDeSimone).<br /><br />\n\"We made quite<br />\na few mistakes,\"<br />\nsays a behooved<br />\nCoach Denny Cox<br />\nTwo early running bursts by<br />\nSchlechter and Fahy beat the<br />\nJays into submission and put the<br />\ngame out of reach before the ten<br />\nminute mark rolled by in the first<br />\nquarter.

Football is one of those<br />\nsports whose record has not been<br />\nanywhere near wonderful.<br />\nBecause of this, 200 fans at the<br />\nopening game of the year was all<br />\nthat turned out. The players,<br />\ncoaches, and others involved in<br />\nthe program, though, work as<br />\nhard as any other sport. As a<br />\nmatter of fact, the majority of<br />\nthe coaches and assistants are<br />\nvolunteers.<br />\nSo what do they get for their<br />\neffortsi Last year their record<br />\nwas 3-5-1, 200 fans a game, and<br />\nvirtually not enough players to<br />\nhave practices where the coaches<br />\ncan afford to do any ersatz<br />\nhitting. Why do the electrical<br />\nengineers and pre-med students<br />\nthen bother to take the time to<br />\ncome out for a losing team?<br />\nRick Law, center and<br />\nsophomore from Baltimore, is a<br />\nsuperb example of what athletics<br />\nat Hopkins are all about. An<br />\nenvironmental engineer major, he<br />\ngets none of the breaks that a<br />\nfootball player at University of<br />\nMaryland would get. None of the<br />\ncars, special tutors, special food,<br />\nspecial dorms, as a matter of fact<br />\nthe football squad here gets no<br /><br />\nspecial anything. The students<br />\ndon't even appreciate his<br />\ndedication by showing up for the<br />\ngames.<br />\nWhat Rick does get is a<br />\ntremendous sense of a job well<br />\ndone, camaraderie, and a chance<br />\nto get out on that field and<br />\nrelease the tremendous amount<br />\nof pressure that the academics<br />\nplace on aperson at JHU. And he<br />\nis good at the center position.<br />\nHead coach Denny Cox describes<br />\nLaw as more than just a super<br />\nperson. \"He's dedicated, loyal<br />\nand hardworking, I can't say one<br />\nbad thing about him. He does not<br />\nrely on pure strength or ability to<br />\nget the job done. He leans heavily<br />\non technique. He's the most<br />\nconsistent offensive linesman for<br />\nthe past two years.\"<br />\nStudent coach Bill McEnroe<br />\nonly duplicates the coach's high<br />\npraise of the team's center.<br />\n\"Ricky's doing the work in the<br />\ntrenches. He blocks for the<br />\nbacks. Most people watch the<br />\nball, and never see the linesman<br />\nwho tre doing the bulwark. But<br />\nthey don't want credit. Their<br />\nsatisfaction comes form within.<br />\nWhen our team scores, within the<br />\nteam its know who has made the<br />\nblocks.\"<br />\nLaw himself doesn't want the<br />\ncredit. \"No recognition doesn't<br />\nbother me. If I have a good<br /><br />\nblock, a touchdown block, it's<br />\nbetter than if I was running with<br />\nthe ball. I work all week for<br />\nSaturday. If it was good then I<br />\nfeel good. If it was a bad game,<br />\nthen it was all a waste. It ruins<br />\nthe rest of my weekend. But you<br />\nhave to put it out of your mind.<br />\nBut I'll get my credit sooner or<br />\nlater, the whole team will.<br />\nThe stereotype that surrounds<br />\nfootball players just doesn't exist<br />\nat Hopkins. Jocks aren't<br />\nadmitted on the basis of their<br />\nathletic prowess only. They go<br />\nthrough he regular admissions<br />\nprocess just like the rest of the<br />\nstudents here. Law would never<br />\ngive up his future in<br />\nEnvironmental engineering to<br />\nplay at a school like The<br />\nUniversity of Maryland with a<br />\nsuperiOr football program, but<br />\nterribly inferior academics. \"I<br />\nwouldn't give up engineering to<br />\nplay for Maryland. They can't<br />\nguarantee the future. 1.m happy<br />\nto go to school here. Of course at<br />\nMaryland the partying isn't<br />\nlimited to Saturday like it is here.<br />\nOf course at Maryland the<br />\npartying isn't limited to Saturday<br />\nlike it is here. But we only party<br />\nhere as much as anyone else. I'll<br />\nonly go to disco night if I have<br />\nmy work done.\"<br />\n\"It's tough coming here as a<br />\nfreshman and trying to play<br /><br />\nfootball, and study. It's tough<br />\nhaving to do the work without<br />\nthe athletics, and then add in<br />\nthree hours a day practicing, plus<br />\nthe two weeks that come to<br />\nschool early and live in the dorms<br />\nbefore orientation. Then on top<br />\nof everything, the high school<br />\nstars that come here expect some<br />\namount of crowds, and then they<br />\nget nothing.\"<br />\nThe entire football situation at<br />\nthe Hop then must revolve<br />\n,,round something other than the<br />\nfans and fringe benefits. The<br />\nreward must be personal. Rick<br />\nLaw is an unsung hero in the<br />\noffensive line and an unadmired<br />\nfootball player at Hopkins knows<br />\nthat only too well.\" You have to<br />\nenjoy it. Some at Hopkins knows<br />\nthat only too well. \"You have to<br />\nenjoy it. Some guys are so<br />\nemotionally involved after a loss.<br />\nYou just have to put it out of<br />\nyour head. No fans affect my<br />\nplaying only in that I'm not quite<br />\nas keyed up as I could be if there<br />\nwerer a few thousand out there<br />\ninstead of two hundred.<br />\nPhysically though it doesn't<br />\naffect me that much. I'm ready<br />\nemotionally and physically. Of<br />\ncourse it would be an incentive<br />\nto play harder if fans were out<br />\nthere.\"<br />\nBY CHRfISTY JO ANDERSON<br /><br />\nBIA<br />\nBY JOHN L.

A person who<br />\nhighly values individuality and<br />\nindependence, Ms. Galfand says<br />\nthat fencing disciplines both<br />\nbody and mind.<br />\nMs. Galfand began to fence at<br />\nage 13 when her school's phys.<br />\ned. teacher started a class. In<br />\naddition to competing in<br />\ninterscholastic competitions, Ms.<br />\nGalfand has participated in a<br />\nnational tournament in Michigan<br />\nand an international one in Israel.<br />\nBefore coming to Hopkins, she<br />\nworked out at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania with Olympic<br />\ncompetitors. Although the<br />\nopportunity to do independent<br />\nresearch was the deciding factor<br />\nin her decision to attend<br />\nHopkins, she was also impressed<br />\nby the fencing team here.<br />\nUnlike tennis, fencing<br />\nequalizes the competition<br />\nbetween men and women;<br /><br />\nPi<br /><br />\nvictory depends on skill, not on<br />\nphysical strength. Ms. Galfand<br />\nsays that she fences well against<br />\nmen, although men are often<br />\nquicker and more aggressive.<br />\n\"Fencing is an art and a<br />\nsport,\" Ms. Galfand says; it<br />\nrequires skill both to play and to<br />\nwatch. Fencing necessitates<br />\n\"point control\" to score the five<br />\n\"touches\" needed to win the<br />\nmatch as well as short-term<br />\nendurance for thrusting. Ms.<br />\nGalfand's exercises include<br />\n100-yard sprints and daily<br />\n2'4-mile jogs as well as leg work<br />\nand arm skills.<br />\nBecause fencing is a \"thinking<br />\nsport,\" Americans do not<br />\nsupport it equally with the<br />\nspectator and team sports,<br />\naccording to Ms. Galfand. In<br />\ninternational competitions,<br />\nAmericans usually rank lower<br />\nthan European fencers, who are<br />\nquicker, use their entire bodies,<br />\nand have better point control and<br />\ntraining.<br />\nAlthough fencing is a major<br />\npart \u2022 of Ms. Galfand's life, most<br />\nof her friends are not fencers.<br />\nHer family, she maintains, has<br />\nnot been alienated by her<br /><br />\nThe Patio (snackbar)<br />\nThe students answer to:<br />\n- quick and nutritious lunches<br />\n-afternoon snacks<br />\n-late night hunger pangs<br />\nThis week's daily specials:<br />\n10/3 hamburger, fries, small soda $1.00<br />\n10/4 kosher hot dog, fries, small soda $1.00<br />\n10/5 cheesesteak sub, fries, small soda $1.70<br />\n10/6 bologna sandwich, fries, small soda $1.00<br />\n10/7 fish sandwich, fries, small soda $1.10<br /><br />\nSchedule<br /><br />\nSports<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Varsity Lacrosse Team meets the 1977 JHU Alumni<br />\nLacrosse Sat., Oct. 1 on Homewood Field at 8:00 p.m. No<br />\nAdmission Fee.

A person who<br />\nhighly values individuality and<br />\nindependence, Ms. Galfand says<br />\nthat fencing disciplines both<br />\nbody and mind.<br />\nMs. Galfand began to fence at<br />\nage 13 when her school's phys.<br />\ned. teacher started a class. In<br />\naddition to competing in<br />\ninterscholastic competitions, Ms.<br />\nGalfand has participated in a<br />\nnational tournament in Michigan<br />\nand an international one in Israel.<br />\nBefore coming to Hopkins, she<br />\nworked out at the University of<br />\nPennsylvania with Olympic<br />\ncompetitors. Although the<br />\nopportunity to do independent<br />\nresearch was the deciding factor<br />\nin her decision to attend<br />\nHopkins, she was also impressed<br />\nby the fencing team here.<br />\nUnlike tennis, fencing<br />\nequalizes the competition<br />\nbetween men and women;<br /><br />\nSports<br /><br />\nvictory depends on skill, not on<br />\nphysical strength. Ms. Galfand<br />\nsays that she fences well against<br />\nmen, although men are often<br />\nquicker and more aggressive.<br />\n\"Fencing is an art and a<br />\nsport,\" Ms. Galfand says; it<br />\nrequires skill both to play and to<br />\nwatch. Fencing necessitates<br />\n\"point control\" to score the five<br />\n\"touches\" needed to win the<br />\nmatch as well as short-term<br />\nendurance for thrusting. Ms.<br />\nGalfand's exercises include<br />\n100-yard sprints and daily<br />\n2-mile jogs as well as leg work<br />\n1<br />\n2/<br />\narrd arm skills.<br />\nBecause fencing is a \"thinking<br />\nsport,\" Americans do not<br />\nsupport it equally with the<br />\nspectator and team sports,<br />\naccording to Ms. Galfand. In<br />\ninternational competitions,<br />\nAmericans usually rank lower<br />\nthan European fencers, who are<br />\nquicker, use their entire bodies,<br />\nand have better point control and<br />\ntraining.<br />\nAlthough fencing is a major<br />\npart \u2022 of Ms. Galfand's life, most<br />\nof her friends are not fencers.<br />\nHer family, she maintains, has<br />\nnot been alienated by her<br /><br />\nSchedule<br /><br />\nBlue Jay Varsity Lacrosse Team meets the 1977 JHU Alumni<br />\nLacrosse Sat., Oct. 1 on Homewood Field at 8:00 p.m. No<br />\nAdmission Fee.
