The second point giving<br />\nmore power to the students is a system of recall and referendum.

Perhaps the results are not indicative,<br />\nthough I believe they are. Less than 10 per cent said<br />\nthey would not have come to Johns Hopkins had Negroes been admitted. . . .

The<br />\nmanager rushed down to Mr DeKantor who said it was just too bad;<br />\nhe was going to remain right where<br />\nhe was and heaven help anyone who<br />\nwas going to try and stop him. The result was that Eddie Cantor witnessed<br />\nthe show from row P.<br />\nHAKESPEARE has in vade d<br />\nGotham again.

But,<br />\nwith no offense to our sophomore<br />\nfriend, we'll still call him Anyfreshman.<br />\nBasketball season came around<br />\nagain and so did Anyfreshman. His<br />\nuniform still didn't look too becoming<br />\non him, but there was some improvement. Along with the improvement<br />\n<br />\nF<br />\nF<br />\nC<br />\nG<br />\nG<br />\n<br />\nfool to let himself feel bad. Although<br />\nthis season wasn't as enjoyable as<br />\nthe thought of playing varsity would<br />\nhave been, (he was yet to learn)<br />\nAnyfreshman had a good time.<br />\nIn his junior year Anyfreshman<br />\ncame around before basketball did.<br />\nAnyfreshman was now becoming determined as is likely to happen to<br />\npeople who have been refused what<br />\nthey most desire. Dame Nature didn't<br />\nexactly smile on Anyfreshman even<br />\nthough she alloted him a position on<br />\nthe varsity squad. She really teased<br />\nhim, for his days of frolic were (in<br />\nthe words of a famous poet) quote\u2014<br />\no'er unquote. Practice was tough and<br />\nso was Anyfreshman's\u2014seat on the<br />\nbench. He saw little action but by<br />\nthe end of the season looked very<br />\npromising as most sports writers are<br />\n\"wont\" to say and as most readers<br />\nhope they \"won't.\"<br />\nAnyfreshman has become a senior<br />\nand modest, for at long last his uniform becomes him so much that the<br />\nladies in the audience nod approvingly<br />\nto one another when he comes on the<br />\nfloor. He is no longer short or tall,<br />\nneither long nor short-legged, neither<br />\nfat nor gawky, neither clumsy nor<br />\ndeliberate, neither inexperienced nor<br />\nworse. A regular at last!<br />\nIn the last game of the season,<br />\nthe climax of his career, Anyfreshman was doing himself proud, when<br />\nthe gun went off. The basketball game<br />\nwas over. It mattered not whether<br />\nHopkins won or lost, it had developed<br />\na man.<br />\n\u2014A L S<br />\n<br />\nA spirited basketball tussle between the freshman and junior varsity teams will provide a special feature tonight in the gym, at 7:15 p m<br />\nbefore the Hopkins-Gallaudet contest.<br />\nFrosh and junior varsity tilts are<br />\nnoted for being closely contested and<br />\nmay prove an exciting preview of the<br />\nvarsity contest. Spirit strikes the<br />\nkeynote of these contests, but tonight there is likely to be more than<br />\nspirit for the freshmen are out to<br />\nrevenge last year's two out of three<br />\ngame defeat.<br />\nLast year the freshmen lost the<br />\nfirst game to the Junior varsity five<br />\nby a great margin. Things looked<br />\nmighty poor for the Frosh in their<br />\nsecond game.<br />\nBut the Frosh, undaunted by the<br />\nformer defeat, stepped onto the court<br />\na very diminutive five which no one<br />\nthought had any possible chance of<br />\noverturning a confident and smooth<br />\nworking junior varsity. However, they<br />\nstepped off a very proud and just vic-<br />\n<br />\nCheckett over the goal line, scored<br />\n<br />\ntory.<br />\n<br />\nthe first touchdown.<br />\n<br />\nThe confident and smooth working<br />\nJ V was neither as confident nor as<br />\nsmooth working when the two teams<br />\nmet -in what was the final clash between these two highly touted teams.<br />\nInstead, their confidence was replaced<br />\nby wariness, their smooth working<br />\ncombination with sure passing.<br />\n<br />\nall along'the side line, the Eta rooters<br />\nwent wild. They had scored first.<br />\nBursting with enthusiasm the team<br />\nran back into position and prepared<br />\nto kick off. The ball sailed into the<br />\nhands of Wall who advanced it into<br />\nEta territory, but after three plays,<br />\nthe half ended, the score 6-0 in favor<br />\nof Eta.<br />\nThe brisk December weather didn't<br />\nseem to bother any of the rooters<br />\nwhose blood aroused by the exciting<br />\naction on the field kept them warm.<br />\nThe half was short. The game began.<br />\nPi Lam displayed real fight in this<br />\nhalf as the score will tell. Continually<br />\nadvancing into the Eta territory, the<br />\nsmooth functioning Pi Lam team<br />\ncame closer and closer to the pay-off<br />\nzone. Carrying the ball from the middle of the field on three plays to the<br />\nEta yard line the spirited Pi Lam<br />\nteam was not to be denied. Here the<br />\nEta 2-2-1-2 defense which worked so<br />\nwell against long passes proved unable to stop either a run or short pass.<br />\nOn a well executed fake run and<br />\npass from Wall to Schwartz the Pi<br />\nLam team tied the score. Here the Pi<br />\nLam rooters gave vent to their passions and shouted praise to their<br />\nteam, which had fought hard and had<br />\ncome back to make things even.<br />\nEach remaining play of the game<br />\nheld the interest of the spectators, for<br />\nany one play might have spelled victory or defeat. The cries encouraging<br />\nthe teams faded as each play began<br />\nand rose again after it ended. Both<br />\nteams fought hard to get the touchdown that might have turned the<br />\nstory and gained the championship.<br />\nRepeated long passes soared thru the<br />\nair, but in vain, the game ended, the<br />\nscore 6-6.<br />\n<br />\nBIRELY'S PHARMACY<br />\nST.

The<br />\nHopkins team represented by George<br />\nWeiland and Arthur Maas, upheld<br />\nthe negative side of the topic; Resolved, That the United States should<br />\ncease to use public funds for the purpose of stimulating business.

The time spent<br />\non answering the questions was not<br />\ncounted in the 12 minutes presentation of each speaker's argument.<br />\n\"The main purpose of this debate,\"<br />\nremarked Arthur Maas, was to test<br />\nthe feasibility as well as the desirability of our new method of discussion. This plan coincides with the<br />\npurpose of all our debates which are<br />\nnot held merely for the sake of arguing, as some might think. We try to<br />\nobtain by our discussions a comprehensive understanding of the topic,<br />\n<br />\nso that when called upon we will be<br />\nin a more informed position to express our opinion.\"<br />\nThe University of Maryland debaters argued that excessive taxation<br />\nwhich results from the government's<br />\nspending policy has prevented business from expanding. Then too, the<br />\nthreat of government competition<br />\nhas hindered the recovery of business.<br />\nThe negative speakers of Hopkins<br />\nbrought out the fact that the withdrawal of government funds, which<br />\ntoday permeate our economic system,<br />\nwould bring us economic chaos.

The second point giving<br />\nmore power to the students is a system of recall and referendum. Under<br />\nthis plan the student body would be<br />\nable to remove from the council any<br />\nrepresentative whom they felt incapable and by the same token would have<br />\nthe power to vote on all legislation<br />\nbefore it was effected.<br />\nKempton also plans to vest more<br />\npower in the council body itself.

Dr Mitchell's appeal was<br />\npublished in full in the November issue of the Alumni<br />\nMagazine.<br />\n\"One may venture that the alumnus of Johns Hopkins University considers the injunction, The Truth<br />\nShall Make You Free, more than an embossed motto<br />\non a seal. It is looked upon as the living purpose of<br />\nthe institution. This means intellectual integrity which<br />\nwill not capitulate to poverty, will not fall in with the<br />\nmerely popular, will not put expediency above honesty.<br />\n\"Surely the application of this noble belief must be<br />\ngeneral, not confined by race, color, or religion.<br />\n\"And yet we do restrict it severely by excluding<br />\nNegroes from the University.\"<br />\n(Dr Mitchell then goes on to explain that he does<br />\nnot believe that there is a \"covering provision in Johns<br />\nHopkins will, a stipulation of the charter, a resolution<br />\nof the Board of Trustees, a formal decision at some<br />\ntime of the Academic Council,\" which excludes Negroes<br />\nfrom the College.)<br />\n\"By excluding Negroes, we are turning our backs<br />\nupon the part of the population which needs us most.<br />\nThe School of Hygiene and Public Health boasts that<br />\nit has students of many climes and colors.

Perhaps the results are not indicative,<br />\nthough I believe they are. Less than 10 per cent said<br />\nthey would not have come to Johns Hopkins had Negroes been admitted. . . .

She really teased<br />\nhim, for his days of frolic were (in<br />\nthe words of a famous poet) quote\u2014<br />\no'er unquote. Practice was tough and<br />\nso was Anyfreshman's\u2014seat on the<br />\nbench. He saw little action but by<br />\nthe end of the season looked very<br />\npromising as most sports writers are<br />\n\"wont\" to say and as most readers<br />\nhope they \"won't.\"<br />\nAnyfreshman has become a senior<br />\nand modest, for at long last his uniform becomes him so much that the<br />\nladies in the audience nod approvingly<br />\nto one another when he comes on the<br />\nfloor. He is no longer short or tall,<br />\nneither long nor short-legged, neither<br />\nfat nor gawky, neither clumsy nor<br />\ndeliberate, neither inexperienced nor<br />\nworse. A regular at last!<br />\nIn the last game of the season,<br />\nthe climax of his career, Anyfreshman was doing himself proud, when<br />\nthe gun went off. The basketball game<br />\nwas over. It mattered not whether<br />\nHopkins won or lost, it had developed<br />\na man.<br />\n\u2014A L S<br /><br />\nA spirited basketball tussle between the freshman and junior varsity teams will provide a special feature tonight in the gym, at 7:15 p m<br />\nbefore the Hopkins-Gallaudet contest.<br />\nFrosh and junior varsity tilts are<br />\nnoted for being closely contested and<br />\nmay prove an exciting preview of the<br />\nvarsity contest. Spirit strikes the<br />\nkeynote of these contests, but tonight there is likely to be more than<br />\nspirit for the freshmen are out to<br />\nrevenge last year's two out of three<br />\ngame defeat.<br />\nLast year the freshmen lost the<br />\nfirst game to the Junior varsity five<br />\nby a great margin. Things looked<br />\nmighty poor for the Frosh in their<br />\nsecond game.<br />\nBut the Frosh, undaunted by the<br />\nformer defeat, stepped onto the court<br />\na very diminutive five which no one<br />\nthought had any possible chance of<br />\noverturning a confident and smooth<br />\nworking junior varsity. However, they<br />\nstepped off a very proud and just vic-<br /><br />\nCheckett over the goal line, scored<br /><br />\ntory.<br /><br />\nthe first touchdown.<br /><br />\nThe confident and smooth working<br />\nJ V was neither as confident nor as<br />\nsmooth working when the two teams<br />\nmet -in what was the final clash between these two highly touted teams.<br />\nInstead, their confidence was replaced<br />\nby wariness, their smooth working<br />\ncombination with sure passing.<br /><br />\nall along'the side line, the Eta rooters<br />\nwent wild. They had scored first.<br />\nBursting with enthusiasm the team<br />\nran back into position and prepared<br />\nto kick off. The ball sailed into the<br />\nhands of Wall who advanced it into<br />\nEta territory, but after three plays,<br />\nthe half ended, the score 6-0 in favor<br />\nof Eta.<br />\nThe brisk December weather didn't<br />\nseem to bother any of the rooters<br />\nwhose blood aroused by the exciting<br />\naction on the field kept them warm.<br />\nThe half was short. The game began.<br />\nPi Lam displayed real fight in this<br />\nhalf as the score will tell. Continually<br />\nadvancing into the Eta territory, the<br />\nsmooth functioning Pi Lam team<br />\ncame closer and closer to the pay-off<br />\nzone. Carrying the ball from the middle of the field on three plays to the<br />\nEta yard line the spirited Pi Lam<br />\nteam was not to be denied. Here the<br />\nEta 2-2-1-2 defense which worked so<br />\nwell against long passes proved unable to stop either a run or short pass.<br />\nOn a well executed fake run and<br />\npass from Wall to Schwartz the Pi<br />\nLam team tied the score. Here the Pi<br />\nLam rooters gave vent to their passions and shouted praise to their<br />\nteam, which had fought hard and had<br />\ncome back to make things even.<br />\nEach remaining play of the game<br />\nheld the interest of the spectators, for<br />\nany one play might have spelled victory or defeat. The cries encouraging<br />\nthe teams faded as each play began<br />\nand rose again after it ended. Both<br />\nteams fought hard to get the touchdown that might have turned the<br />\nstory and gained the championship.<br />\nRepeated long passes soared thru the<br />\nair, but in vain, the game ended, the<br />\nscore 6-6.<br /><br />\nBIRELY'S PHARMACY<br />\nST.

This plan coincides with the<br />\npurpose of all our debates which are<br />\nnot held merely for the sake of arguing, as some might think. We try to<br />\nobtain by our discussions a comprehensive understanding of the topic,<br /><br />\nso that when called upon we will be<br />\nin a more informed position to express our opinion.\"<br />\nThe University of Maryland debaters argued that excessive taxation<br />\nwhich results from the government's<br />\nspending policy has prevented business from expanding. Then too, the<br />\nthreat of government competition<br />\nhas hindered the recovery of business.<br />\nThe negative speakers of Hopkins<br />\nbrought out the fact that the withdrawal of government funds, which<br />\ntoday permeate our economic system,<br />\nwould bring us economic chaos.
