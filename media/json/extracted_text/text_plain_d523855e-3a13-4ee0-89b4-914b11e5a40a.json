The university's first country-music show featuring some<br />\nof the very best in the field provided an evening of entertaining<br />\nmusic and won, I'm sure, many<br />\nfans to Bluegrass. The audience<br />\nwas very receptive to Merle<br />\nTravis who, it seemed, was a<br />\nlittle surprised and sincerely<br />\npleased by this.

The<br />\nsinging of Merle Travis has the<br />\n<br />\nsimplicity, earthiness and unsophistication of folk songs and<br />\nis made enjoyable by his friendliness. Of course the big deterrent to the popularity of this<br />\nmusic is that Northerners, city<br />\npeople and university students<br />\ngenerally consider this the music of an inferior class.

Scoring honors for Haverford went to scoring twins Jerry Darlington with<br />\n19 and Pete Dorwart with 14.<br />\nDorwort also picked up 24 rebounds.<br />\n<br />\nCoach Ross Sach's varsity<br />\ncagers gained their first victory<br />\nof the season at the expense of<br />\nTowson State Teacher's College<br />\nlast Tuesday at Towson. Four<br />\nplayers hit in the double figures<br />\nin this 76-53 victory, Co-captains<br />\nBilly Characklis and Paul<br />\nKrouner, along with Mike Ratner<br />\nand Dick Carroll each scored<br />\nmore than 10 points. Ratner was<br />\nhigh scorer for Hopkins with 16<br />\npoints, followed by Krouner with<br />\n16, Characklis with 14. and Carroll with 12. Characklis also<br />\ngrabbed off 17 rebounds in the<br />\ngame.<br />\n- 40'<br />\n<br />\nThe Jays, definitely playing<br />\nand shooting better ball, hit on<br />\nthirty of sixty seven field goal<br />\nattempts, and on sixteen of<br />\ntwenty five free throw attempts.<br />\nThis shooting percentage was a<br />\nvast improvement over the<br />\neighteen of sixty nine shots<br />\nagainst Haverford, The Hopkins<br />\nteam, almost the same squad that<br />\nbeat Towson 69-41 last year, took<br />\nan early lead and never gave it<br />\nup. Leaving the court with a 3623 advantage, the Jays back even<br />\nstronger in the second half and<br />\nwon 76-53. Russ Fabiszak of<br />\nTowson Teachers was high scorer<br />\nfor the game, dunking eight field<br />\ngoals and a free throw for 17<br />\npoints.<br />\nIn their game at Philadelphia<br />\nagainst the Haverford Red Raiders, the Jays came out on the<br />\nshort end of a 62-45 score. Unlike the triple overtime thriller<br />\nlast year which Hopkins lost 6564. this game was marked by poor<br />\nshooting. The Jays made only 18<br />\nof 69 shots for a percentage of<br />\n26',; while Haverford did a little<br />\nbetter, hitting 25 for 69 for a<br />\n36q total.

Coach Sachs will<br />\nprobably be counting heavily<br />\nupon high scorer and leading rebounder Billy Characklis to lead<br />\nthe team tomorrow.<br />\nIn three games thus far,<br />\nCharacklis has racked up a total<br />\nof 43 points for a 14.3 point<br />\naverage per game. Krouner has<br />\n32 points for a 10.6 average, and<br />\nMike Ratner has 30 points for a<br />\n10.0 game average. As leading<br />\nrebounder, Characklis is averaging 15 pickoffs per game.<br />\n<br />\nIt now appears that the cagers<br />\nhave gotten to their feet. After<br />\nplaying a fairly good game<br />\nagainst Delaware, the Jays<br />\nslipped and played a slipshod<br />\ngame against Haverford. However, they rebounded against<br />\nperennial patsies Towson, and<br />\nappear on the way to a hopefully<br />\nsuccessful season.

Willy Loman, a traveling<br />\nsalesman by profession, has<br />\nlived his life believing in the<br />\nmaterialistic standards of success set by our society, and has<br />\ntaught his two sons, Biff and<br />\nHappy that \"the man who succeeds is one who is well liked.\"<br />\nIn high school, Biff was the<br />\nschool hero, an all around athlete<br />\nwith the world at his feet, and a<br />\ngreat future ahead of him.

The university's first country-music show featuring some<br />\nof the very best in the field provided an evening of entertaining<br />\nmusic and won, I'm sure, many<br />\nfans to Bluegrass. The audience<br />\nwas very receptive to Merle<br />\nTravis who, it seemed, was a<br />\nlittle surprised and sincerely<br />\npleased by this. Earl Scruggs<br /><br />\nand his amazing fiddler received<br />\nseveral spontaneous hands for<br />\ntheir solos.<br />\nThis recent popularity of<br />\ncountry music by Northerners,<br />\ncity people and university students is not really surprising.<br />\nThe music especially in concert<br />\nis very appealing \u2014 true happy<br />\nmusic, Bluegrass has the brilliance, improvisatory nature and<br />\nenergy of Dixieland jazz. The<br />\nsinging of Merle Travis has the<br /><br />\nsimplicity, earthiness and unsophistication of folk songs and<br />\nis made enjoyable by his friendliness. Of course the big deterrent to the popularity of this<br />\nmusic is that Northerners, city<br />\npeople and university students<br />\ngenerally consider this the music of an inferior class. The performers, real country people,<br />\nsteadfastly refuse to try to<br />\nmollify their Southern dialect<br />\n(i.e. improve their English) to<br />\nnot chew gum or not clean their<br />\nears when they feel like it.

As a result, identification of babies in Swedish<br />\nhospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring their<br />\nbabies home.

Clewell<br />\nannounced that the alumni have<br />\ngranted the club $362 for the<br />\nrental of a pool. The club practices Mondays, Wednesdays, and<br />\nFridays from 6 to 7 at the B&amp;R<br />\nAthletic Club.<br />\nThe club has also acquired a<br />\nfull time coach. William Baugher<br />\nhas consented to work with the<br />\nteam. Clewell said that the coach<br />\nhas been very enthusiastic, and<br />\nshould be even more commended<br />\nbecause he is not receiving any<br />\ncompensation for his labors. The<br />\nclub, however, will attempt to<br />\ndo something or him along this<br />\nline.<br />\nGreat Potential<br />\nWhen asked about the club's<br />\npotential, Clewell replied, \"Tremendous.\" John Mogey is a fine<br />\nbackstroker, as is Billy Kirwan.<br />\nThe butterfly and medley relay<br />\nis handled well by Craig Smith,<br />\nTom O'Donnell and Ray Karr<br />\nare good on breast strokes, and<br />\nClewell himself is a fine diver.<br />\nThe team's immediate weakness<br />\nseems to be the free style, but<br /><br />\nClewell said that Bob Swanson<br />\nshould handle this department<br />\nvery well, once he gets in shape.<br />\nFrosh Needed<br />\nBecause of a school rule prohibiting freshman from swimming in the Mason-Dixon Championships, Clewell remarked that<br />\nthose freshmen who are out for<br />\nthe squad, really have nothing<br />\nto swim for. He did, however,<br />\nsay that he would appreciate<br />\ntheir coming out for tne squad,<br />\nas they are eligible to swim in<br />\nthe dual meets that the club<br />\nhas scheduled.<br />\nAt the swimming meeting,<br />\nheld last week, Clewell said that<br />\nseveral freshmen recorded their<br />\nbest times in high school, many<br />\nof which were better than existing Mason-Dixon records. These<br />\nboys, said Clewell, are extremely<br />\ngood swimmers, and, although<br />\nthey can only compete in dual<br />\nmeets this year, should be a<br />\ngreat help to the club in the<br />\nfuture.<br /><br />\nPAGE NINE<br /><br />\nFrosh Wrestling Team Holds Sport's Fate In Hands<br />\nThe future hope of intercollegiate wrestling at Hopkins, the<br />\nfreshman wrestling squad, began<br />\npractice last week in preparation for its winter schedule.<br />\nDue to the lack of support of<br />\nthis year's varsity wrestling<br />\nteam, freshman coach Marc<br />\nWilliams feels that the success<br />\nof this year's squad will determine the future of intercollegiate<br />\nathletics at Hopkins. \"I only<br />\nhope that the fellows will stick<br />\nwith the sport,\" comments coach<br />\nWilliams.<br />\nCoach Alumnus<br />\nWilliams, who graduated from<br />\nHopkins in 1960 wrestled 191 and<br />\nheavyweight during his junior<br />\nand senior years here.

Ratner was<br />\nhigh scorer for Hopkins with 16<br />\npoints, followed by Krouner with<br />\n16, Characklis with 14. and Carroll with 12. Characklis also<br />\ngrabbed off 17 rebounds in the<br />\ngame.<br />\n- 40'<br /><br />\nThe Jays, definitely playing<br />\nand shooting better ball, hit on<br />\nthirty of sixty seven field goal<br />\nattempts, and on sixteen of<br />\ntwenty five free throw attempts.<br />\nThis shooting percentage was a<br />\nvast improvement over the<br />\neighteen of sixty nine shots<br />\nagainst Haverford, The Hopkins<br />\nteam, almost the same squad that<br />\nbeat Towson 69-41 last year, took<br />\nan early lead and never gave it<br />\nup. Leaving the court with a 3623 advantage, the Jays back even<br />\nstronger in the second half and<br />\nwon 76-53. Russ Fabiszak of<br />\nTowson Teachers was high scorer<br />\nfor the game, dunking eight field<br />\ngoals and a free throw for 17<br />\npoints.<br />\nIn their game at Philadelphia<br />\nagainst the Haverford Red Raiders, the Jays came out on the<br />\nshort end of a 62-45 score. Unlike the triple overtime thriller<br />\nlast year which Hopkins lost 6564. this game was marked by poor<br />\nshooting. The Jays made only 18<br />\nof 69 shots for a percentage of<br />\n26',; while Haverford did a little<br />\nbetter, hitting 25 for 69 for a<br />\n36q total.

Krouner has<br />\n32 points for a 10.6 average, and<br />\nMike Ratner has 30 points for a<br />\n10.0 game average. As leading<br />\nrebounder, Characklis is averaging 15 pickoffs per game.<br /><br />\nIt now appears that the cagers<br />\nhave gotten to their feet. After<br />\nplaying a fairly good game<br />\nagainst Delaware, the Jays<br />\nslipped and played a slipshod<br />\ngame against Haverford. However, they rebounded against<br />\nperennial patsies Towson, and<br />\nappear on the way to a hopefully<br />\nsuccessful season. After Swarthmore, Hopkins takes on Franklin and Marshall and Gettysburg at home.<br /><br />\nin the form of pretzels and potato chips, and music will blast<br />\nforth from the more appropriate records of the W.J.H.U. disc<br />\njockeys.
