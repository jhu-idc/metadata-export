Indeed, they will go further, and demonstrate that the little achievements of today are<br />\nthe fundamentals that become the big things of<br />\ntomorrow. Just as Willie Hoppe, the great<br />\nbilliardist, will tell you that there is no such<br />\nthing as an easy shot in billiards, so electrical<br />\nspecialists have found that frequently the seemingly big conceptions have depended on the perfection of details that those unfamiliar with<br />\nelectrical history would often mistakenly regard<br />\nas unimportant.<br />\nThus the growth of Westinghouse, and of the<br />\ngreat industry of which it is a part, has been<br />\ncompounded of many ingredients; of vision that<br />\nsaw present needs and future requirements, of<br />\nengineering genius that could bring forth practicable designs to fill them, of courage that never<br />\nfailed to try once more, of enthusiasm, and integrity, and faithfulness to the little and the<br />\nlittle-known jobs as well as to those that were<br />\nbigger and more pretentious. Westinghouse has<br />\nalways had a need, and a welcome, for men who<br />\ncould supply such qualities.<br />\n<br />\nIt is the daily expression of qualities like these<br />\nthat earns a man the regard, as well as the respect, of those who work with him.<br />\nPerhaps the foregoing may suggest some of the<br />\ncauses that lie behind the success, and this appreciation, of Harry Phillips Davis, Vice President in executive charge of all Westinghouse<br />\nproduction and engineering activities. During<br />\nthe thirty-odd years of his service he has contributed consistently to electrical progress, not<br />\nonly by his work on arc lights and meters and<br />\ntransmission apparatus, but by his effective and<br />\nloyal attention to the detailed requirements of<br />\nthe many activities with which he has been<br />\nassociated.<br />\nMr. Davis has a reputation for getting things<br />\ndone, regardless of difficulties. His constructive abilities have carried him far, his contributions to the electrical art have greatly aided in<br />\nthe maintenance of the engineering supremacy<br />\nwhich is the Westinghouse ideal, and he is recognized, with particular emphasis, as one of those<br />\nto whom is due the development of methods for<br />\nthe quantity production of first-grade electrical<br />\napparatus.<br />\n<br />\n\f", "format": "basic_html", "processed": "VOL.

The visitors have just<br />\nreturned from a trip through Virginia, where they faced some of the<br />\nstrongest country club teams in the<br />\nstate. They have also tackled a<br />\nnumber of college teams and have<br />\nmade a very creditable showing.<br />\nThe team will be made up of<br />\nKerr<br />\nand<br />\nBarrett,<br />\nMenton,<br />\nSweeney, who for several years<br />\nheld the Junior State Championship and played on the Baltimore<br />\nCountry Club tennis team last season. They will be met by a team<br />\npicked from the following list of<br />\nHopkins men: Rowland, Wells,<br />\nHofmeister, Bloom. Jacobsen and<br />\nDuffy.<br />\nOn April 29 Hopkins will meet<br />\nDrexel, and on the third of May<br />\nCatholic University will come here<br />\nfor a match, followed by one with<br />\nGettysburg, on the fifth,- A return<br />\nmatch will be staged at \"Evergreen\" on May 17 with Loyola.<br />\nThe tournament has .been progressing slowly, owing to the intervention of the holidays. Captain<br />\nDuffy urges all the participants to<br />\nPlay off their first two rounds by<br />\nthe end of next week.<br />\nIt is with great pleasure that the<br />\nfollowers of the tennis ball observe<br />\nthe improvements which are being<br />\nmade on the courts.

First, be must<br />\ndetermine if he has adequate training to do the necessary work. Then,<br />\nhe must take note of how much<br />\nexperience and knowledge he will<br />\ngain. This is, perhaps, the most<br />\nimportant consideration. \"Indeed,<br />\nsome engineers,\" he said, \"change<br />\njobs every three months for the<br />\nfirst five or six years after leaving<br />\ncollege, in order to gain practical<br />\nexperience.\"<br />\nAnother thing to decide, according to Mr. Ault, is whether one desires to stay at home or whether<br />\none is willing to travel. Of course,<br />\neveryone likes to stay at home with<br />\nhis friends and family.

Indeed, they will go further, and demonstrate that the little achievements of today are<br />\nthe fundamentals that become the big things of<br />\ntomorrow. Just as Willie Hoppe, the great<br />\nbilliardist, will tell you that there is no such<br />\nthing as an easy shot in billiards, so electrical<br />\nspecialists have found that frequently the seemingly big conceptions have depended on the perfection of details that those unfamiliar with<br />\nelectrical history would often mistakenly regard<br />\nas unimportant.<br />\nThus the growth of Westinghouse, and of the<br />\ngreat industry of which it is a part, has been<br />\ncompounded of many ingredients; of vision that<br />\nsaw present needs and future requirements, of<br />\nengineering genius that could bring forth practicable designs to fill them, of courage that never<br />\nfailed to try once more, of enthusiasm, and integrity, and faithfulness to the little and the<br />\nlittle-known jobs as well as to those that were<br />\nbigger and more pretentious. Westinghouse has<br />\nalways had a need, and a welcome, for men who<br />\ncould supply such qualities.<br /><br />\nIt is the daily expression of qualities like these<br />\nthat earns a man the regard, as well as the respect, of those who work with him.<br />\nPerhaps the foregoing may suggest some of the<br />\ncauses that lie behind the success, and this appreciation, of Harry Phillips Davis, Vice President in executive charge of all Westinghouse<br />\nproduction and engineering activities. During<br />\nthe thirty-odd years of his service he has contributed consistently to electrical progress, not<br />\nonly by his work on arc lights and meters and<br />\ntransmission apparatus, but by his effective and<br />\nloyal attention to the detailed requirements of<br />\nthe many activities with which he has been<br />\nassociated.<br />\nMr. Davis has a reputation for getting things<br />\ndone, regardless of difficulties. His constructive abilities have carried him far, his contributions to the electrical art have greatly aided in<br />\nthe maintenance of the engineering supremacy<br />\nwhich is the Westinghouse ideal, and he is recognized, with particular emphasis, as one of those<br />\nto whom is due the development of methods for<br />\nthe quantity production of first-grade electrical<br />\napparatus.<br /><br />"}], "field_media_file": [{"target_id": 37625, "display": null, "description": null, "target_type": "file", "target_uuid": "116c05e3-2f42-4e11-80e8-ff1b780b83c3", "url": "http://digital.library.jhu.edu/system/files/2022-03/13002-Extracted%20Text.txt"}], "field_media_of": [{"target_id": 13002, "target_type": "node", "target_uuid": "7c7b1c10-9008-4edf-9196-fc6558b38800", "url": "/node/13002"}], "field_media_use": [{"target_id": 15, "target_type": "taxonomy_term", "target_uuid": "c6a3a700-c007-4c4f-b77a-403d89b54878", "url": "/taxonomy/term/15"}], "field_mime_type": [{"value": "text/plain"}], "field_restricted_access": [], "field_unique_id": [{"value": "e40e63cb-3a7b-4e25-86b2-f994e488b909"}]}
